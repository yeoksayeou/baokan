<h3 id="c27">將何以遏制災禍實 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>我國頻年以來。災禍相繼。人民逃死無所。故禍亂相循。迄今無有寗日。在各省區中被天災最甚爲時最久者。當推陜西省爲第一。溯自民國十八年以還。陜省即遍遭荒旱販賣幼女掘食樹根之事日有所聞。近乃愈演愈烈。凡旅陜省者類能目覩。關中各縣。民房大都無門扇窗格。蓋一般人民。已典盡賣絶。無力繼續維持。而土地房屋。因捐稅奇重之故。無人肯承受購買。遂至劈破門窗。以作柴薪出賣。　支暫時之生活。至各慈善團體之救濟雖不能謂爲無補。然多屬佈施性質。僅惠及一時且亦難長遠救濟。而此種救濟。尤非救災之根本辦法。况　水車薪。終不能遏止災區之繼續擴大也。本年春季。陜省曾數次得雨麥苗尙佳。據一般推測。以爲或可略舒困頓於目前。而實際上則因種籽缺乏。人工稀少。未種之田。幾佔耕地之半。即使本年豐收。尙不敢確切肯定其在短時期内可恢復原狀不謂前月初間忽又大風爲災麥苗天折春收無望加以政治上之種種惡影響由地方軍隊之搜刮以至苛稅雜捐縱在尋常年程人民且將不堪。况又益之以天災乎。陜西人民。其不轉徒於溝　者幾希矣。</p>
<p>廣義推察。今日我國之被災區域。豈止陜西一省遠之如四川如甘肅。民間皆饑寒交迫。生機斷絶而四川各軍仍不顧人民生死祇知奪取地盤。　情　削。不知人民窮困至於不克聊生之後軍隊又焉能倖存。其他若江焉湖北。以及豫南等處「赤禍」之區人民所受苦况。未必即减於川陜之災禍。是皆與人事有關。非必盡屬天災人力亦不能挽救之也。頃者强隣無故稱兵津東居民。以砲火炸彈之威脅。不得巳而逃避平津現在秩序漸安。人心粗定而此輩災民。旣不能在平津駐足。又豈能向遠處逃荒。設欲歸回故邑。則廬舍爲墟田疇荒蕪。其困苦顚連之狀。亦不减於他處受災之人。環顧我中國能安居樂業者。尙有幾何。而時時感受天災人禍之猛烈襲擊者正復未有艾也。</p>
<p>然而「天作孽猶可逭。」古有明訓。徴之史册。不乏舊例。不過我國每遇天災流行。往任其自然發展。人工之絶對勝利。僅一大禹能收治水之全功。其餘皆無克制人事上變動之力。量故由漢唐迄於明淸。類多以災荒爲起因。而演成朝代更易之禍亂李自成張獻忠之突起。實源於災荒。明社遂以不保。所謂小康時代。實亦不過亂後之一時睡眠狀態耳非眞有致治之道求治之方也。吾人所最爲遺憾者。即我國人事行政。並未完全發揮政治上固有功能。以求致治之道耳試觀吾人之緊隣。其侵略我國。土魚肉我人民。誠令人切齒痛恨。但細察其國内人事政治亦有足爲吾人取則者。例如一九二三年九月關東大地震。房屋倒潰五十五萬六千家。死亡人口十餘萬。损失財富一百億丨約占全日本國富十分之一有奇卒以上下一心之努力復興。不十年間創痕全復。遠之如歐洲之德意志。當世界大戰之後。全國幾成丘墓。即此天文學上數字之賠欵。宜乎無復興之望矣。乃亦於十年之間。百廢具舉。仍　於世界六大强國之林。我國今日洵處空前未有之困境。即以天災而論。其面積之廣。受禍之深均非一朝一夕可得而恢復。我國人苟不迅速奮起。於消極言面洗除一切「人禍」之根。由積極方面從事於政治上一切建設。將何以遏止災禍之繼績侵襲。此則吾人之所深憂者也。</p>

<p>德國自從希特拉禀政以來、法西斯蒂國家、又多一　、　爲了穏定其政權、也不惜效法　　的秦始皇匪但把有紅色含有革命　義的著述一齊列爲反籌意志精神、并且褐衫黨四出搜尋、把這類書籍付之一炬、把左　的學者一齊趕走、在西方如此、當然在東方、也不可太單調、日本是幾十年來　　德國最誠心而又最相似的國家特　　軍事上學得　　、這是世所共知的故事、</p>
<p>日本雖不像德國那樣子遭受戰後的嚴重打擊、有賠欵的重荷、有凡爾賽和約的束縛、但是他却一力製造謂國難、在世界恐慌中要用武力打開經濟的出路、所以硬作出了九·八事變、由軍事行動而剌激軍需品工業、而表而支　　着生産指數在字面的平衡、又因爲警察的嚴密、軍部和新聞界的一致行動、　是日本的眞實内容、外間差不多没有人　　充分的知道牠、日本一般社會也是「　國主義」中毒、即使不中毒人也不敢　說話、一則有警察的監視再則有在鄉軍人會的蠻幹、說話而含有「眞理」的人、没有說話的機會、其著述也很難得與社會公開見面、則文化是會退步的、</p>
<p>不過在日本國内研究、還可以相當自由、在帝大圖書館及其他圖書館、還收藏着很多的禁書、各大學敎授、中也還有許多人、在那裏尋找「眞理、」這些尋找眞理的人、特别是要在社會科學當中去尋找眞理、是軍事當局的眼中釘、是現時日本社會的反叛者、京都帝大從前出了一個河上肇、巳經驚天動地、可是在一般智識界、他却有「真理」的權威、博得多數人的信、仰現在又也了瀧川幸辰敎授事件、瀧川敎授在一年前、著過一本「刑法讀本」這本書原來没有什麽大不得了的「大逆不道、」僅只站在馬克斯主義立場、批評日本現行刑法的缺點、於是就成立了觸犯當局的罪名、將受免職的處分敎育部所說明瀧川敎授的罪狀是、</p>
<p>「第一關於瀧川敎授的刑法著述、其根本思想是馬克斯主義的思想、并且他又承認社會經濟的構造之變革是需要的、第二關於「刑法讀本」所述的内亂罪、（他承認那是革命、）亭是有害於日本的善良風俗、第三、瀧川敎授各種著述、如「刑法讀本」「刑法講義」等、都是妨害安寗、破壞醇風美俗的、所以違反　　「淘養學生人格、培殖國家思想的原則」</p>
<p>、於是敎育部主張將瀧川敎授休職、以正學風、」</p>
<p>殊不知學校方面、從學生以至於敎授總長、都不與敎育部的主張相同第一他們主張大學校研究自由、而這種自由、是法律反賦與的第二是瀧川敎授的著述、匪但未嘗絲毫破壞國家思想、有損淘冶學生人格、而且正是成全這種思想、正是養成學生忠　的信念、第三是敎部蔑視京都帝大的自治、越權罷免瀧川敎授的敎職、於是京大法學部全體敎授助敎講師助手等三十九名學者、一齊提出辭呈、小西總長也呈請辭職、同時法學部全體學生一千六百餘名、爲了擁護「眞理」擁護學問的研究自由、很堅固的團結起來、和當局的非法壓迫相抗爭、非特京大的各學部、對法學部要有同情一致的援助、即其他的帝大、也正在醖釀着與　大同情的及敎育部的運動、在大阪東京等都市的京大畢業同學、都準備着擁護「研究自由、」反抗「政府暴力」的運動、日本學校、從來不甚閙風潮的、這回的　潮、在思想上却是有很重大的意義、在政治上也是有嚴重的影響、但看這次風潮如何展開罷、（一九三三·五月三十日於大阪）</p>

<p>（廬山會議）孫氏首稱、此次中央各要人、齊集廬山、並非正式會議、僅爲一種談話性質、互相交換意見而巳、巳對於停戰協定、剿共事宜西南問題、馮先生事、全國代表大會等各重要問題、均有所討論、對於停戰恊定、全以軍事爲原則、任何政治外交問題絶不提及、西南及馮先生事、擬派人解釋、臨時全國代表大會、改於十一月十二日開正式大會、</p>
<p>（停戰經過）至此次在華北簽訂停戰恊定經過、因日軍自侵佔長城以南威迫平津後、我方以長城線既全失陷、而南天門亦告不守、在軍事上實處於無辦法之境、同時日方向我提出覺書、苟不接受停戰恊定、日軍即進攻平津、中央處此情形之下、遂忍痛與日方接洽停戰由政務委員長黃郛、就商於軍分會委員長何應欽、共同電向中央請示、經中央全體考慮之結果、决定原則如下、㈠恊定僅限於口頭、不見於文字、㈡不劃任何緩兵區、㈢限於軍事部分、不及政治範圍、㈣會議時僅由雙方軍事當局辦理、外交及政務槪不參與結果、日方對於、二兩項未允、而我方一以須應付抗日、一以須應付漢奸、不得巳遂於不涉及政治範圍之内、將日方所提覺書、加以修正簽訂現有之協定、至外傳將承認「滿洲國」等事、决非事實畫「滿洲國」事、關係國際整個變更、更不但我國絶對未能予以承認、即國際間亦未能予以承認也、</p>
<p>（西南問題）孫氏繼謂西南各同志、及蔣光鼐·蔡廷鍇·等、通電反對停戰、皆不明華北情形之故、中央已去電解釋、當可明瞭實際情形、諒解苦衷、西南出兵剿共事件、亦有進、展總之、剿共抗日大家多須明白事實、共同合作、方有辦法、</p>
<p>（馮抗日事）日前平津一帶之戰事、已告結束、中日兩軍之間、設有不住兵區域、暫時當然不致發生衝突、惟自馮煥章先生獨豎抗日旗幟以來、日方頗爲注目、長城一帶之日軍、現正移向西北集中、行將進攻察、省爲軍亦由多倫南進、圖襲張垣、察省異常危急、馮氏只有衛隊三千人、此外尚有少數雜色軍隊、力量異常薄弱、關内之國軍如開察省增援、深恐引起馮氏之誤會、故中央若派軍往援、亦感困難、北平政務整理委員會委員長黃膺白氏、現已委派代表赴察晤馮、恊商一切、俾察省不致淪陷於敵手、</p>
<p>（全代大會）臨時全國代表大會、當時僉以華北事件重、要預備團結黨外一切的同志共圖挽救、嗣西南方面誤解大會性質、通電反對、現在中央以臨時會、本無此項規定、亦從未開過、同時籌備不及、乃决改至十一月十二日、開五次全國代表大會、正式會議、討論解决一切重大問題</p>
<p>（應付漢奸）當平津形勢危急之際、平津漢奸爲日方收買者甚衆最著者爲張敬堯·齊爕元·孫傳芳·石友三·等張在津領得一百八十萬元、專唆使漢奸、收買我方軍隊及各方政客、自張敬堯被剌後、所獲證據、内容五光十色、無所不有、如冀圖成立華北軍政府、陰謀第二俾儡國等等、不一而足、此種舉動、不但犧牲平津、並將影響整個國家故統觀局勢、確不得不暫時停戰、以便整理一切云云、</p>

<p>復濟南萬君來信</p>
<p>答：來書寫得一把鼻涕，兩把眼涙似的，把現在人類社會看得一錢不値。誠然，現在的社會現象容易引起大家的悲觀，但是社會的幸福本來是從鬭爭中獲得的，我們對於社會還未嘗絲毫參加這種鬭爭的生活，便怨天尤人地說社會怎樣卑污，怎樣陰暗，社會自然會乾脆地答道：要想不卑污，不陰暗，就趕快地進來幹一幹，袖着手在旁觀講風凉話的人是没有資格批評現在社會的。</p>
<p>不錯，你的家庭，你的老母都在這種陰暗的社會裏犧牲了，但是你也曾追求過，這是誰的責任呢？你一定没有追求過這一問題，所以只得「囫圇呑棗」地駡道：「中國人的心都是自私自利到了尖點的，毫不知廉恥，毫不知慈愛，尤其是愛玩小巧，愛欺侮弱者，愛獻媚强者┆┆」實則一個社會到了轉變的時候，一般現象總是這樣，然而假使你研究法國大革命，俄國大革命的歷史，你便會看見，當時耳濡目染總不外乎寡廉鮮恥，喪心病狂，一點是非没有，整個社會好像成了一個中風麻木的尸體，實是這就是舊社會已經到了不可終日，走進墳墓，好比大風雨要來到的象徴，忽而天昏地暗，一齊煞住，所謂「萬木無聲待雨來」，就是這樣的現象。轉變新時代時非常神奇的，只要牠的高潮到來，人類的自革心與道德心便會馬上增高，然而這種太陽般的熱烈生活，絶不是如足下所想「到近於原始人類的西北邊塞去，那裏可以自耕自食可以忘記以前的一切，可以開始另一人生的樂趣」的退守的思想的人所能享受的，而且這種思想根本是在作夢：現在的西北，一邊受了蘇俄的社會主義的暗示，一邊又受着某帝國主義的「旦旦而伐之」的侵襲，最近的將來，不爲「外蒙」之續，便爲東三省第二，也絶没有地方給你這要「忘記以前的一切」，而「開始另一人生的樂趣」的别致人兒來做「新式桃花源」；而且我要問你：你果其相信，中國社會只生了你一個這樣「不卑污奸巧，而且只有一顆熱烈的心」的好人麽？老實說罷，照你這種話頭，就曉得你還是初入社會，實在禁不起社會的大冶爐的炬火來鍜鍊丨若果像你這樣入社會一定不久便會變成和你所痛心疾首的壞人一樣。只有在這萬惡社會，翻過無數筋斗，然而還是依然故我，甚至『薑桂之性，老而彌辣』的人才能在現在的社會中站得住，才能和牠奮鬭，才能改造牠。要想致力於社會人羣，隨時隨地，隨事隨物無往而不可。古人也說過，『兵刑錢榖，皆可以</p>
<p>爲堯舜』。做一個革命的領袖固然是一個職業；做一個小書記也是一種眞實的職業，但看你站在什麽立塲，向着那一方面努力罷了。至於你所提出的問題，也就在這兒答覆一下罷？</p>
<p>㈠社會人類之醜惡與卑污，不是絶對的而是相對的：不是一成不變的而是隨着社會的制度之變化而變化的，你對於人類社會的認識，完全是感情作用而且是近視眼丨自然是「片面的」丨㈡人生的快樂與痛苦也是相對的，是互爲因果的。譬如，革命是極痛苦的，然而在血泊中求得解放，爭取自由，却是快樂的。貪官污吏，吸骨敲髓，飲酒食肉，驕妻美妾，或是賣國奸賊，殃民軍閥，席豐履厚，金玉滿前，固然是快樂，然而一人肥而天下瘦，一家笑而一路哭，民衆視之爲獨夫，社會恨之如仇讐，淸夜之心固有所不安，而千夫所指，無病而死之命運，亦早遲難逃，放眼以觀，却是極大的痛苦。『要取得快樂』没有别的方法，只有以大多數之憂爲憂，以大多數之樂爲樂，以此爲奮鬭標準則得矣。㈢答意已見前，不再贅。</p>
<p>說到書籍，你最好要熟讀以下各書：</p>
<p>㈠法國大革命神州國光社出版</p>
<p>㈡我的自傳神州國光社出版</p>
<p>㈢法國革命史亞東書館出版</p>
<p>㈣革命與反革命新生命出版</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第四章業務之情形</p>
<p>第四節舊醫與國藥</p>
<p>舊醫没有醫院的設立。所有病人全在門診出診之中。故而論幾個紅醫士。每日診治的病人。往往有驚人的數目。例如上海有一個小兒科舊醫。每天門診要近一百號。每看一號門診。不過三分鐘。一面诊脈。一面早就由學生開方了。他的業務發達至於天色微明。巳經門庭如市。因爲他拔號先診加倍的診例。就發生了一件很有趣的事。丨有許多人抱了一個小孩子去看病。在大淸早就去化二元掛了號。在門外等着。假如後來的一個小孩患着較重的症候。急於要先診他就將號單用三元賣給他。如此一來。倘若自己的小孩子要看病。只化了一元。如果就此不看病而回家。反而賺了一元。於是某醫生的號單。竟成了有價證劵。他的門外。竟成了交易所。也可算奇談。而某醫也眞足以自豪了。</p>
<p>還有一個婦科專家在城裏每天也要看到一百多號。每開一張方子。也不逾三五分鐘。據說能知胎兒的男女。不曉得統計上準確不準確。</p>
<p>還有一個世傳的喉科。大都用白喉血淸與腥紅熱血淸。每天門診。也要診至一百號左右。親眼有人看見他。右手壓了病人的舌頭看喉嚨。一面却又用左手看一個小兒頭上的癤子。而口中還在那裏喊藥名。命學生開方。一面另有幾個學生代他打血淸。然而門外候診者。還是擁擠。所以他的家中。有鐵門維持秩序。</p>
<p>以上的情形。有人以爲神秘。其實不過是人們一種太崇拜經騐的心理所造成。而加之許多盲從的附和着罷了。但是社會上。自然有一部份人不贊成這種過於潦草的醫家。於是反過來。就有幾個醫士。一天另限定看二十號。過此不候。過時不候。一方面將診金提高至數倍。表示他一天精神貫注的代價。過橋越界。要二三十元之多。居然也得社會上的同情。如今我們要談舊醫業務的眞相。都不能拿以上各人爲代表。以上所述。僅　乎這幾人的開業方法。和他個人的幸運而巳。大多數舊醫總計的業務。發達與否。我們還是從藥舖的多寡上看出來。可以說是很發達。而原因所在。究竟還是人民習慣和知識近於舊醫。不近於新醫罷了。有一個很顯明的例子。可以作證。鄙人診所之中。至今每月必有一二個病人。不知道新藥吃法的。往往我開好了横行文的方子給他。他還問「先生這方子是否向藥材店裏去買了來煎？」。必須我與他重行說明方去。丨以我個人業務之有限。新醫色彩之鮮明。上海這種都市之開道。而尚有這種病家。就可以知道一般人對舊醫藥觀念之深。而一方面可以知過去的新醫業務。尙未深入民間。那麽舊醫業務。自係還佔着大部了。至於上文所謂掙扎。還是舊醫在知識階級中與新醫掙扎罷了。</p>

<p>第二個例，是我的好朋友林ＸＸ先生的令妹，今年大約五十歲左右，向來抱獨身主義，服事老母，而且熱心敎育，不遺餘力，是很可佩服的一位女士，她本來有胃病的，去年增加起來了，據愛克司光線診斷，和種種臨證上診斷，也是胃癌的病。後來嘔吐得非常利害，並且自己說，這個嘔吐，好像從頸部發生出來，不像從胃中起來的，據醫生診察，也覺得頸部似乎有點膨脹，但是一心以爲這個嘔吐，是因胃癌所造成的幽門狹窄而起的，所以不甚把膨脹部留意。後來越弄越利害，奄奄一息，大有朝不保暮的情形。忽然來了一個和尙，說有藥可治。其法，是先把牛飢餓了兩天，却用苦揀樹根皮給他嚼，牛的口中，就有許多粘涎出來，採取這許多粘液，灌入病人口裏去那裏曉得一服之後，大吐特吐，吐出許多膿汁，從此之後，嘔吐雖然不曾完全停止，也就好了許多，人也漸漸見活潑起來了。於是乎鄕間傳爲奇談，有的說單方一味，氣死名醫，有的說，是我佛顯聖。丨因爲林女士是奉佛的，丨紛紛不一，不多幾時，忽然又聽說巳經歸天了，問害了什麽病而死的呢？說是肺炎，而且只有三天工夫就完了。我聽見了這回事，始終絶抱了滿腔疑問，後來碰着陳ＸＸ醫師，因爲他去診治過好幾次，我就詳細問他，他說：「病是確給和尙醫得好多了，但是我想，病人的劇烈嘔吐，或者是頸部生了膿瘍，剌戟了延髓中的嘔吐中樞，牛涎吃下去的時候，膿瘍的時機已熟，碰得凑巧，大吐之後，膿瘍　咽喉食道方面潰破，排出了許多膿汁，以後，當然食物也可下嚥了，剌戟也減少了，嘔吐也和緩了，自然身體也漸漸兒覺得好點了。至於胃癌恐怕是没有醫好過罷。」我覺得這個說明，是很合理，我又問他說：「後來死於肺炎的話，究竟是不是呢？」他說：「那就不得其詳了，但聽說死得很快。」我就說：「發病以後，不過三天就完了，若是肺炎，决没有這樣急速的，的，恐怕胃癌尙未醫好，因了勞動等等原因，突然大出血起來，血液出得多了，當然有氣急喘吼等見證，旁人就以爲是肺炎了，亦未可知。」陳君說：「或者是胃穿孔，發生腹膜炎，亦未可知。」我和陳君討論，就此結束了再也不能作進一步的研究。我想這個例，若能夠實行病理解剖，種種疑問，當然就可以迎刃而解，就是我佛顯聖一段神話，或者也可以消除，如今没有眞憑實據來證明，這個悶葫蘆，是永遠没有揭曉的機會了，眞是使我沈悶得很，惋惜得很啊丨</p>
<p>從第二事實看來。可以曉得没有病理解剖，是對於疾病豫防和治療等方　，永遠不會有進步。「治病必求　本」這句話，我們貴中國内經裏面未　没有。「用藥如用兵，知彼知己，百戰百勝」。這種論調，在我們貴國醫的著書裏面，是常常拜讀過的，但是說是只管這樣說，可是從没有人去實做那「求本」和「知彼」的工作。並不是不想做，實在是没有實做的方法，器械當然也是不夠用，然而第一是没有病理解剖，没法想，只得把古人所講的瞎說，不管三七二十一，深信奉行起來，並且創造古聖人是「生而知之」的話，以爲神農黃帝那班人物，是有疑神疑鬼的智能，可以不把人體行實地研究，已經可以澈底明白，所以他們所說的，是一點不會錯；我們後來的人，是肉體凡夫，只配奉著古人所講的話而行，不配把古人的話再來懷疑。這種思想，其實是無路可走，只好把這種話兒，來自己安慰自己，自己欺瞞自己，並且照這辦法，方才可以穏住社會，把定飯碗，這一番做作，本是狡滑人想出來的權宜策略，那裏曉得子子孫孫相傳下去，百一班笨貨，認眞當做實話，造成宗敎式的醫學，從此「求本」和「知彼」的工作，專就書本上鑽研了，於是乎風呀，火呀，暑呀，濕呀，少陰呀，太陽呀，腎虚呀，肝旺呀，說得五花八門，至於實在情形，却一點不講，譬如腎虚，究竟虚在那裏，還是貧血，還是萎縮；還是結核；還是生瘤；一槪都不管，專憑　瘦無力，腰酸泄精等等證候，羣就算是腎虚了。胡亂用點人參地黃等藥，就算是治腎虚，譬如濕，究竟濕的本態是怎樣？還是水？還是粘液？還是炎症的結果滲出來的？還是循環障碍的結果漏出來的？一槪都不管，只憑着頭重胃呆四肢怠惰等等證候羣，就算是濕了。胡亂用點白术半夏茯苓等藥，就算是健脾利濕了，這種診病治病的方術，歸根結底，完全是虚空，那裏有一絲一毫和病的實際相切近呢。所以永遠没有「求本」和「知彼」的可能，換一句說，就是永遠不識得病，永遠不識得眞正治病方法，到了近代科學醫進來以後，舊醫們爲掙扎門户起見，並「求本」和「知彼」的話也不敢說了。因爲說了，反足以顯自己的醜。暴露自己短處，摧殘自己根本，所以瞞得實騰騰的一點風聲也不走漏，庶幾乎一般社會，可以長此欺騙下去，再進一步，對於科學醫的病理解剖工作，還要說醜話，造謡言，說是挖人眼吸人血再不然，說是殘忍，說是慘無人道，說是不近人情，　丨自己没有病理解剖的工作，應該如何歡迎，如何提倡，如何仿效。不料倒翻轉來，偏弄出一番妬忌譏笑和搗亂的行爲，眞是不長進不要好呵。</p>

<p>科學的淸潔淸潔實爲健康之基礎。則學術上之理由必須充分具備。僅恃風俗習慣卑淺之常識。則不足。醫學進步之今日。凡有爲健康障碍之原因。無不明瞭。今日所舉行之淸潔運動。以驅除有害健康之原因爲目的者也。蓋淸潔立於病原學基礎之上。以豫防疾病爲目標。是以不得不舉行之也。即有自感覺的淸潔移於科學的淸潔之必要。更自衛生上之立塲以研究其不潔。分爲化學的不潔與生物學的不潔二種。</p>
<p>化學的不潔敷粉於面而罹鉛中毒者有之。是即化學的不潔之一也。飲含鉛質之水。則中毒。此水爲化學的不潔也。食河豚魚而死亡。亦食物中有化學的不潔之故也。又傾於腐敗之食物。含有害防腐劆之飲料等。此皆爲化學的不純不潔者也。空氣之中含有一種一酸化炭素之有害瓦斯。亦化學的不潔之一種也。衣服之着物中含有有害之顔料。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>亦爲同等不潔。凡可爲中毒原因之品。皆可作爲化學的不潔也。</p>
<p>生物學的不潔縧虫之幼虫寄居於　魚體内。人食之而致病。是鱒魚爲不潔之物。蔬菜之外觀雖淸潔。然其葉若附有蛔虫之卵或腸傷寒之病原菌。則亦當視爲不潔物。井中之小視爲危險。平常多以其化學的成分不良。有害於身體。然其中若有傷寒菌混。入則尤危險。檢查飲料水而見其含有阿摩尼亞。則不適宜於飲料。非謂阿摩尼理爲毒物不可供飲料之用。實因阿摩尼亞多發生於厠所。含有此種成分之水。恐其與厠所相連。因而不無危險之故。糞便混入水中之所以發起危險之理由。其危險不屬於化學的。萬一糞便中含有腸傷寒菌赤痢菌等。此等病菌與水共入口中。故有危險。即所謂生物學的危險是也。然將此危險之井水加以煑沸而行消毒。則可保平安。而含有阿摩尼亞之水稍經煑沸。則阿摩尼亞飛散。亦可再使用矣。</p>
<p>所謂此種生物學的不潔者。乃病原性細菌寄生虫卵混入而發起疾病危險之意義也。例如肺病患者之痰。因其含有結核菌。故有危險。健康人之痰並此菌。故無危險。是故健康人之痰。雖屬污穢。並無危險。肺病患者之痰。若經一次煑沸而殺滅之。外觀雖穢。亦同一無危險也。雖同爲痰。生物學的並無不潔。大水便亦然。若將傳染病患者之大小便。經煑沸消毒之後。雖令入口。亦無危險。外觀上雖屬不潔污穢。並不發生影響於人類之健康。固不必兢兢注意之矣。外觀雖無何等異常。而自科學上觀之。得爲疾病之原因者。不可不深切警戒之也。即淸潔之施行。有科學化之必要。科學的淸潔之要訣。维何。曰。其屬於化學的。在於稀釋。屬於生物學的。宜行消毒。無論如何猛毒。加水稀釋。即成無害。無論若何危險。如鼠疫菌霍亂菌。加以熱力或藥品殺菌。亦得消滅其危險。應用此等科學的智識。以求其淸潔之澈底。是爲至要之事。</p>
<h3 id="c142">救濟農民之衛生法 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 丁福保</p>
<p>近年農民已瀕於破産。破産則衣食不周。而欲與之講衛生。颇非易易。茲以最經濟確有實效之衛生新法言之。</p>
<p>吾於若偏食各種動物類。則身體必病。因肉類中缺少維他命石灰質炭水化物故也。又肉類中屯積原有之廢料。及由各動物之疾病而來之毒質。與屠宰後所起之腐化作用。故專食肉類者。須排泄多量之廢料及毒質。久之則腎臟發炎矣。肝臟心臟亦病矣。頭痛便秘精神疲倦矣。血管壁變厚矣。動脈硬化矣。周身發痛風病矣。况又有肉類中寄生蟲乎。若偏食各種植物類。則身體必日益健康。因蔬菓米麥中含有各種之維他命。石灰質炭水化物故也。又素食者之體力。最能持久，病後亦易復原。其消化亦較肉類爲易。此乃美國米勒耳博士之學說也。余自四十五歲起。不食肉類。至今巳十有六年矣。身體精神。自覺日有進步。日日照常辦事。亦未嘗有一日因病而輟業也。故第一奉勸農民须終年素食。可省經費不少。</p>
<p>白米因失去糠皮。故無第二種維他命。因此失去滋養料甚多。食之往往易患脚氣。故吾人宜食未去糠皮之糙米、糙米中之滋養料最夥。農民不知其原理。而以食品中最貴重之糠皮飼猪。眞可惜也。日本某博士竭力提倡宜食糙米。並謂食白米九十元。若改食糙米。僅六十元可矣。據此則知若食糙米。不僅富於第二種維他命。併可省米價三分之一。故第二奉勸農民須終年食糙米。可省經費不少。</p>
<p>美國符禮查氏衛生新法。提倡節食多嚼主義。於衛生上頗有大益。其法遇確實飢餓時。始用食物。一也。凡食物皆須加意咀嚼。嚼至爛碎。然後嚥下。二也。食時將腦力集中。注意於口内。留心其如何嚼法。如何與唾液　和。有如何之滋味出來。如此則唾液充足。以唾液刺激胃腺。故胃液亦充盛。將食容易消化。消化則容易吸收。吸收則自覺腹已食飽。即可止食。止食須聽命於自然滿足之感覺。若食至胃滿腹脹。感覺不適。實屬不俣。三也。嚴守以上三條。即節食多嚼之必要條件。已經全備。消化所餘之殘渣。自然減少。不至重苦其内　。糞量銳減。不發惡臭。腸内之積糞自少。所食之物。盡量得其使用。故全體狀况。日益佳狀。此自然之理也。故第三奉勸農民須終年少食多嚼。可省經費不少。</p>
<p>農民之衛生。當求其合於經濟及不費經濟者行之。其合於經濟者。已知上述。其不費經濟者。如深呼吸與日光浴。則當於此　續言之也。</p>
<p>夫深呼吸者。乃改造身心之一種運動也。其最大之益有三。能使肺臟得適宜之運動。呼吸空氣有充分之轉換。增强肺臟之抵抗力。保持肺臟永久之健康或消滅已患肺病之結核。尤以肺尖結核亦能撲滅。爲深呼吸最大之攻效。其益一也。能使腦部血液循環佳良。即深吸氣時因胸廓内之壓力減。而使腦脑實質之血液下注。呼氣時又因胸郭内之壓力高。而使下注之血液還流。此種作用。能防止一切腦血管之病變。（如喪生最速之腦溢血俗稱中風者是。）其益二也。能使腹腔之血液循環佳良。即深吸氣時。因腹壁所加於胃腸壁肝脾　腎等表面之壓迫。使此等部分之血液。向四方流散。而呼氣時壓力一弛。則又從四方流入。此種作用。能使腹腔内血液循環變佳。分布於腹部内之神經。亦受同樣作用而强健。因此腹内臟腑之機能亢進。種種疾病。無從而生。其益三也。综上所述。故深呼吸不啻爲吾人生命線無形之長城。而呼吸之空氣。盈天地。無代價。取之無窮。用之不竭。又爲人人皆可享受之物也。</p>
<p>東西各國之衛生家。其行深呼吸之法則。種種不一。以余個人之經騐。則以鼻孔之更迭呼吸。爲最相宜。其法至門外空曠處立定。將肺内之氣。從兩鼻孔呼出。呼至不能再呼。其時即以一手指捺一側之鼻孔。而以他側之鼻孔盡量吸氣。吸至不能再吸。即放下手指。徐徐呼氣。是爲一次。每行一次。須走六十步。立定。再行第二次。每回約行二十次。共走一千二百步。可以代時計。亦可以代全身運動。每日約行四五回。則必能得深呼吸之種種利益。蓋此種鼻孔更迭呼吸法。其吸氣之作用。深長而有力。對於前述之種種作用。均有適度之功效。且因一側鼻孔之吸氣。其　較爲和緩。胸廓之壓力。不致　减。而腦實質之血液。得徐徐下注於胸廓。使腦部不致現出急激之貧血狀態。而發生眩暈也。</p>
<h3 id="c143">中法製藥廠參觀記 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 陳昌華</p>
<p>余久慕中法製藥廠名，以其創立雖未數年，而譽滿國内，當然有可觀之成績在也，　當聞友人云，該廠乃滬上有數之藥廠，其中規模之大，現時國内同業，實罕有與匹者，日前以友人介，得識該廠廠長周夢白先生，周君和　可親，亦中華藥典編纂者之一，國内各醫藥學報，常可見其著作，蓋現今之藥學專家也，蒙彼不棄，允予次早晨赴該廠參觀，故余與友人得準時同往，一償余多年未遂之宿願也，豈不快哉。</p>
<p>該廠地處本埠大西路之西，占地約十餘畝，廠屋之正面爲一二層樓中國舊式樓房，廠長室與總務科均在焉，工人食宿於是，且有少許之工塲出品，亦貯存於是，（據云其大部份，每日均由自備貨車，運往總店，然後寄發各處，）更進則有新式鋼骨水泥之三層樓洋房一座，乃該廠全廠精華所萃之處，觀其底層大半皆爲機器工作塲所，計七八間，茲分述之於後。</p>
<p>㈠製丸間内有製丸機十二架，聞每架每日之出品，約可四十餘斤，又有調粉機二架，專司調和粉末，以供製丸之用，機之原動，均用馬達，而丸之原料，則纯係國藥，吾人常服之國貨龍虎牌人丹，及新近登報更名之新紅丹，老紅丹，及銀丹等，悉由是製成。</p>
<p>㈡打光間内有打光機四架，此爲人丹製造之最後一步之工作，據云，此人丹外衣所用之硃砂，係採取國貨廣東硃砂，故其光澤，與他家用日本硃砂者不同，可見該廠採用國貨之决心。</p>
<p>㈢製錠間内有製錠機二架，專製各種錠劑，如阿四匹林片，加斯卡拉片，嬰孩快樂片，及金鷄納霜片等，不下數十種，余等參觀時，機中所軋者，爲羅威阿四匹林片，分最準確，潔白可愛，無怪人皆樂用也。</p>
<p>㈣製粉間内有製粉機共四副，專司研製各種粉末，如甘草，大黃，桂皮，丁香等，舉凡藥物之須製爲粉劑者，該廠無不自行製遇，有一爲卡脫氏式，（ＣＡＩＴＥＩＳ　ＡＩＳＩＮＴＥＧＲＡＬＯＲ）亦用馬達洩引者，能壓大塊而成小塊，碎粗粉而成細末，出品極速，該廠又以現所有各種製粉機，不敷應用，故尙有數架，已在添置中，則將來之出品，更可觀。</p>
<p>㈤乾燥間内有眞空乾燥機一具，機甚大，其旁有新式抽氣機，且有鐵管以連通之，據謂凡不能用高熱乾燥之藥品，均可置此機中乾燥之，機旁又有一室，中有汽管，利用蒸汽之餘熱，以乾燥各種藥物，室中又懸有温度調節器及電扇，可謂設備周至矣。</p>
<p>㈥糖衣間内有糖衣機二部，機爲圓形，外圍温熱，旁有風扇，以調節熱量與水份之揮發，據謂現時市上所稱分量準確之象牌糖衣金鷄納霜片，卽由該廠是處製造之。</p>
<p>㈦洗瓶間　因該廠出品種類過多，而瓶之式樣又大小不一，故此項洗滌工作，庶不利用機械，而用人工，室中除各種洗滌器外，尙有蒸汽烘乾廚一具，蒸汽消毒廚一具，蓋瓶洗淨後，須經消毒烘乾，方可使用也，余向知洗瓶之處，最難淸潔，今該廠竟注意及此，殊堪欣佩云。</p>
<p>此外尙有箱衣間，配粉室等處，余因未及細觀，故此處亦不能盡述，僅誌其名而已。</p>
<p>二樓之上，製造科在焉，主任爲林鴻藻藥師，現所有全廠各處關於製造事宜，悉歸該處管理，而原藥，貨棧，配製，包裝，等四股屬之，其旁并有研究室，以備檢查或研究之用，是日余等見室中正在試騐一種藥品，考其是否符合藥典規定，據周君言，近時藥商因减低價格之竸爭，常有不顧道德以作僞者，如南京路某外商藥房，亦有作假事實發生，實爲遺憾，關於製造方面，則見正在配製中之艾羅補腦汁，九一四藥膏，及其他數種巨量藥品，然仍别各間以分司其事，更述之如下。</p>
<p>㈧煎煮間内有煮沸機二具，如壓蒸機一具，加熱攪半機一具，及冷攪半機一具，補腦汁卽在此處製造，聞每　秋冬之間，其工作最爲忙碌，蓋除補腦汁之外，尚有羅威麥精魚肝油及孩兒面等，均須大量趕製，以應市塲之需求也。</p>
<p>㈨蒸溜間内有蒸溜機三架，其中一架，係專製巨量之蒸溜水，因該廠凡配製所用之水。均爲此水，且有數處大學之化學室中所用者，如光華復旦等，亦由該處供給，以其水質純凈，而售價又復低廉也，更有一具，余等參觀時，見其正在作杏仁水之蒸溜，余知現時市塲　之杏仁水，大都僅用杏仁油加水，而該廠獨能　照規定以製造之，實屬大可贊許。</p>
<p>㈩浸漬間　間内有最新式滲　簡十餘架，及壓榨過濾器數架，聞　凡中華藥典及其他各國藥典之　劑，浸膏，流膏，流浸膏等，均在是　製造，據謂該過器之　造，十分精巧，因彼旣能使大量製品迅速濾過，又能濾淸普通濾法不能濾過之物，如該廠出品之急救時疫水，卽用是機過淸，聞每日濾過之量，可達四千餘磅之多。</p>
<p>㈩㈠油　間　專司各種油膏之製造，前言九一四膏，卽在此處製成，聞平均可出一千打之譜。</p>
<p>㈩㈡膠囊間專門製造各種軟丸，如魚肝油，余等見時，係在製造九一四白濁新藥，現時市塲上所有之白濁藥雖多，然大半恐皆舶來品改裝，或劣貨假充，今該廠獨能自行製造，實堪欣佩，并聞其方，係依照最新　理配製，故問世迄今示及兩載，遂已遍銷全國，挽回利權，　　不少。</p>
<p>以上所述，均係屬于配製方面者。</p>
<p>之上，大半爲紙盒棧，小半爲包裝間，此間專供大批藥吕包裝之用，有女工約六十餘人，其工作極爲敏捷，洋房之左，則有西式樓房一排，其上亦爲包裝股，現所有另星之件，均置是處以包裝之，女工人數亦與三樓相彷彿，樓下則爲原藥存儲之所，又有鍋爐室，設于洋房之右側，爐不甚大，聞每日燃煤至多僅及一噸，然亦以該廠原動，純用電力，而此鍋爐之汽僅供加熱之用耳。</p>
<p>此外更有東廠者，係因廠屋不敷應用，于去歲新行擴充者，有鉛皮平房一排，占地畝餘爲貯藏各種玻璃瓶之棧，又有新建平屋十六間，蚊香製造處，選丸間，灰乾室，及人丹包裝間等在焉，聞該廠製造蚊香之原料，亦純屬國産品，如除蟲菊，現均採自無錫南通等處，據云若國貨原料不得，寗可暫停不製，人丹包裝間，有女工八十餘人，此間每日連夜工可出五分包人丹十萬餘包，據云此種國貨人丹，本不在是處製造，自周君接手後，大加改良，故近年出品，已較前進步不少矣，想國人定能　之。</p>
<p>綜觀全廠各處，皆井井有條，甚有　勃之氣象，雖現時一般外國成藥滿布國中，而該廠所抵制者，僅其十分之一，然自中華藥典出版後，因周君與藥典編纂有關，故其所製之藥典製劑，均按照中華藥典製造，用先提倡，其原料亦常有少量之試，均足以表現周君對於發展我國藥業之苦心，非獨抵制外貨已耳，實有關於國民生計也，實業救國，吾於周君有厚望焉。</p>

<p>㈠百米耶拉許勝來不易</p>
<p>霪雨霏霏中最始運動第一項决賽卽爲男子百米六人實力相等一番劇戰自在意中起步後程金冠最先領導湯史萊不甘示弱矮東洋（岡）極力追趕耶拉許落在第四瞬息之間尙餘三十米時耶拉許飛步疾追勁道十足虎虎有聲起比達終點耶拉許已追出前茅卒以一肩獲勝亦云險矣時間十一秒四程第二湯第三岡第四黃飛龍蒙納漢落選</p>
<p>㈡女子五十米有劇戰</p>
<p>美國托姆遜女十係七秒大會最高紀錄保持者</p>
<p>日前預賽爲白乃特女士壓倒昨日决賽滿擬報復前恨但事與顧達雖經劇戰卒以一米之差再敗於白乃特白費時七秒二錢行素努力追趕得第三亦堪自慰</p>
<p>㈢高欄陳陵慘敗</p>
<p>一般人之意料老將陳陵可穏得冠軍豈知竟遇敵手前五欄陳陵脚步輕鬆極爲寫意小鬍子派克力隨其後不稍免强前五欄過後二人平肩而馳相持不下脚步正齊姿勢優美至最後一欄猶在平衡綫上但過欄下落時派克先一步衝出乃得冠軍陳陵脚力稍衰而致落後然相去不過半步耳時間十七秒一較預賽進步第三郭智新第四密洛諾夫</p>
<p>㈣女子百米仍屬白乃特</p>
<p>女子百米决賽形勢與五十米相仿托姆遜又差一米落第二白乃特女士再獲冠軍時間十三秒五美國鮑爾第三錢行素免强得第四</p>
<p>中欄第一陶英傑（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>㈤四百米四人與賽</p>
<p>四百米决賽中華共有四人但臨賽時　長發何德放棄未跑僅雪潑特曾榮忠鄧格爾及劉福康四人逐鹿發脚後曾落第三雪潑特飛步領前功夫極佳二百米後曾榮超出鄧格爾力追雪潑特而不着劉福康　　　後　以五十二秒竟全程平等依格爾之大會最高紀錄</p>
<p>㈥一萬米相勢緊張</p>
<p>萬米决賽爲昨日最富精彩之一幕十八人與賽跑畢者十二人中華王正林與俄國利夫金谷法國葛拉特英國克雷極四人劇烈竸爭一路之上自始至終四人寸步不離互前互後不稍放鬆故形勢格外緊張竸爭愈覺精彩四座觀衆報以熱烈掌聲當最後一　時王正林放開大步突出前茅觀其態度自然步子優美領前有十五碼之遥四座掌聲益爲熱烈全場爲之興奮以爲可以穏取冠軍不料尙餘百米時俄國利夫金谷受旁人沿途陪奔助威努力　刺卒被追出王正林而獲冠軍同時法國葛拉特　譚稚聲夫人給獎（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>躍而上王正林反覺速度减少遂亦被追出君遭慘敗十分惋惜英國克雷格第四時間三五分二八秒八當利夫金谷尙餘百米之時塲畔俄人在旁俄人在旁陪奔照章不許總裁判沈嗣良上前攔阻無效利夫金谷雖獲冠軍理應取消資格事後中華隊管理竟不提出抗議可謂玩忽之至如利夫金谷無從旁之助　則冠軍一席或將仍屬王正林而葛拉特亦未必能追上也茲將十二選手名交錄下</p>
<p>㈠利夫金谷（俄）　㈦依爾的許夫（俄）</p>
<p>㈡葛拉格（法）　㈧徐彦　（中）</p>
<p>㈢王正林（中）　㈨陳虚舟（中）</p>

<p>㈦千六百接力創新紀錄</p>
<p>千六百米接力中華隊再創全國新紀錄時間三分四一秒破遼寗隊在濟南十五屆華北運動會三分四一秒六之全國紀錄此賽共中美日法勢往後被我國曾榮忠再上接棒後美國名將塞維斯追出我國何德寳領前力衝中華頗示危險幸至第三棒時相去不遠董叔昭接棒後力衝超前中華又佔勝勢最後一棒美國接棒遲疑中華關長發已前去甚遠乃獲第一美國第二日本第三法國第四當法國接第四棒時旁觀法人令其放棄莫跑免得顯醜然此人堅持須跑以畢全程結果雖落第四已多二分亦趣事也中美兩隊陣線如下</p>
<p>中華隊㈠曾榮忠㈡何德寳㈢董叔昭㈣關長發美國隊㈠巴托洛米㈡塞維斯㈢勃列琪㈣鄧格爾</p>
<p>㈧二百米程金冠有功</p>
<p>二百米預賽中華程金冠以爲祗能得第三難勝雪潑特及耶拉許但結果雪潑特固得第一毫無疑問但程金冠能勝耶拉許而得第二良足自豪第四爲中華董寅初時間二三秒四</p>
<p>㈨中欄陶英傑冠軍</p>
<p>陶英傑一路領先穏取冠軍時間六一秒陳陵初與陶平肩往後脚力稍衰漸落後被密洛諾夫追上大貓孫惠培最後一欄拌跌幸後　來者終獲第四</p>
<p>㈩八百米塞維斯利害</p>
<p>八百米决賽美國大將塞維斯功夫極好非他人之敵以二分七秒八得冠軍第一圈李延祥居第二後被董叔昭超出但追塞　斯不及李延祥與與侯德瑞最後百米又被英國利特及勃列琪超出而董叔昭亦被利特壓倒董反落第三勃列琪第四</p>
<p>（十一）八百米接力中華慘敗</p>

<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>幾年前，也曾搭平浦鐵　車拜訪　北國的都會。那裏雖然白天　也飛揚著黃　，滿　了鼻子，但這是我底家，我底祖國，我愛它，深深地愛它，一種戀慕的印象，至今還很明　的低　腦際。</p>
<p>當日軍的大砲轟破了山海關，山海關外的靑天白日　被埋葬了；當日軍的飛機流彈炸斷了萬里長城，長城外也都換了黃龍紅日的滿洲旗；不用說，如果有機會我得北上的話，要再向　寗，吉林，熱河，黑龍江去　大片的森林。高峩的雪山，浩闊的冰河，我是不是能夠不領取某國的旅行執照，說我是出國去了呢？</p>
<p>記得一部份國軍，正與野蠻民族在　内外鬥爭的時期裏，有許多年輕人北上殺敵，繼着紅十字會的會員，也北上救護，繼着小姐們也帶了餅乾紙烟，北上勞軍並且，各地　了大批的大刀。運輸北上，供給殺敵在九一八至最近停戰的日程裏，事實上更有中央軍的北上，有宋部長的北上，有何部長的北上，更有蔣委員長的北上，最近又有黃郛委員長的北上。自然，在後方一部分軍人與民衆機關的大人物通電說北上，而遲遲我行的還不算入内。</p>
<p>畢竟黃郛委員長的北上，才露出了和平的曙光！這北上的意義之隆崇，和北上後爲國爭光之努力，我們要不表示欽仰與感激也不可以了。單我個人，安居在上海，寫中國文字，讀中國新聞紙，在户籍上，也算是中國的國民，我有什麽理由能不向和平天使禮讀呢！</p>
<p>雖則我還有許多兄弟，許多姊妹，漂流在遼寗，吉林，黑龍江，熱河；丨不，他們漂流在外國，他們至今没有給我信，他們也許是被殺了吧？</p>
<p>然而，歷史告訴我們，不抵抗的民族是只配被殺，由是觀之，何怨之有？雖然復雖然，或者黃郛委員長在四不條件不喪權，不辱國，不屈服，不妥協，）下努力交涉的結果，野蠻民族會交還了我們的失地，到那時候，靑天白日　又飛滿森林上，雪山上，冰河上；則我現在被拘留於外國的同胞們，又歸還給中華民國做國民了！不用說：我們萬一眞有機會北上去觀戰地的殘跡，旣不要領取某國旅行執照的烦麻，更無力說漂亮的名字：「出國去」？</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>講起剃頭兩字，也是歷史上一頁慘痛的事實，當淸初順治二年六月間，頒下薙髮的誥令，倘然違背了這一道上諭，就要「殺無赦」，所以檄到各縣裏頭，遂有「留頭不留髮，留髮不留頭」之重典，甚至僱了許多薙髮匠，負擔遊行街市，見了蓄髮的人，執而强剃之，碰到不從，稍一抵抗，就殺他的頭，懸掛在擔子竿上以示衆，你想好不殘酷啊？後來因此種種而身殉的，眞是不少，竟有築「髮塜」，而私自流涕致祭以申哀悼，故江陰的死守，吾邑的受三次屠殺，可以說大半因剃頭而起，我前天（上月二十九日）見火雪明君引「聞道頭堪剃，而今竟剃頭」一首詩，記得德淸典　老人也曾作過剃頭的古意，這首詩，他老人家編詩的時候，且並未列入，不知何故，也許是出諸游戲筆墨，那末就屏棄了。適纔於故紙堆中，檢得幼時抄下來的舊稿，把他寫來，可見此老對於剃頭一件事，描摹得更覺盡致了。</p>
<p>人生尺寸膚，何一不當賣，豈眞疾在首，而乃薙同草，乃有古人語，頗足備一考，髣髴使蕩然，何有　與蚤，以譬治山賊，當先除其道，此語誰爲之，　鑠伏波老，試之小黃門，一時定絶倒，其後文文山，有詩載遺稿，髮亡心則存，想見熱如　，而吾生於今，頗覺此事好，旣免壯士衝，亦減商山皓，經旬不一剃，首乃如蓬葆，誰歟執其役，短衣而破襖，入廚呼作湯，驚走戞羹嫂，注水洗頭盆，伏而鹽　腦，一尺布不縫，粗更甚魯縞，以代礪石磨，仍能茫刃保，但聞霍霍聲，如割田中稻，其下承以盤，奉若圭垂繅，過眼天花飛，滿頭敗　掃，吾非陶彭澤，折腰亦弗惱，甚或閉兩目，不辨白與皂，低昻黍麥頭，忽已新如棗，倘有蟣　臣，勿問胎與夭，旣而握髮三，舍舊更新造，交柯靑珊瑚，　絲黒瑪瑙，吾身欹側久，如木科上槁，爾乃手推敲，有若苦吟島，耳門不容麥。亦復恣探討。其具貯一筒，合喚葫蘆套，須臾技盡奏，頰更飲水澡，顧視種種髮，風戾未及燥，酬之靑铜錢俾就酒家媪，而我坐一室，耳目滌煩燠，起觀晴　外，睨日尙杲杲，髯收未足責，髮神或可禱，聊以醒低睡，非敢矜速藻。</p>

<p>保存蔬菜鮮味法</p>
<p>我們日常所吃的蔬菜，依季節的關係，供給的　類，時常不同的，然而無論何種蔬菜，住在鄉村的人，才可以天天吃到新鮮的滋味，至於住在都會的，往往因爲　要與供給不均的緣故，不能買到當天新鮮的貨，卽使當天買得到新鮮的，也有剩下來，留在隔日用的，也有多買材料，預備兩三日用的，所以主婦們每天買到的蔬菜，應當要有相當的保存常識，那末，所吃的菜，就不至於失了新鮮的味道了。現在我把保存新鮮的方法，來說一下：第一·各種靑菜買回後，應放在黑暗的砂土上面，最忌撒水或浸水，而且各種蔬菜，千萬不可混合，應當各别的貯藏，譬如芋艿山芉等類，切不可放在有濕氣的地方，照這樣的保存，那就不會失去本來的鮮味了。普通没有常識的婦女們，往往不知道保存的方法，買回的靑菜恐怕菜葉乾枯，常常用水撒在上面，或浸過水中，表面上看起來，似乎很新鮮的，實際上，不但失去鮮味，連原有的葉綠素與鐵質以及其他營養分，因爲水的緣故，都被分解了。第二·切不可掛在通風的地方，若是恐怡乾枯，可用兩三層報紙包好，外面的報紙，先用水噴濕，再用繩紮緊，掛在黒暗不見光的地方，那就可以保存多日了，至於其他的蔬菜類保存的方法，依性質形體而不同的，譬如瓜，筍，茄子·若是保存七八天，可盛在籃内，用杉檜等菜四面塡好就可，如要保存數個月，那須用乾燥的罐一個，下面舖塡三四分黃砂，把瓜筍·茄子等放在上面，各物以不接觸爲度，再裝以二三分黃砂，等到盛滿後，用粗草紙密密的貼蓋在　蓋上，再在地中掘一地洞，把罎放在地洞内，上面再覆以五寸泥土，那末，雖經過一年，也不會腐敗，捲心菜放在黒暗的砂土下面，或用報紙包好，可以保存多日，惟放置時，應皅菜心向上，切不可浸水，菜心就要腐爛，但是芹菜的性質，比較不同，不可過於乾燥，若要保存新鮮味道，可用濕巾包裹放在盤裏，豌豆以帶豆莢的貯藏在暗的地方，可以經久不變，新鮮的香菇，用杉檜等樹葉塡好，掛在空氣流通的地方，生　要藏在乾燥不見陽光的地方，或乘在水泥罐中亦可。總之，各種蔬菜，名目繁多，不能一一詳細的說明，總以放在不見陽光黒暗的砂土上面，或盛在砂土罎中爲最適宜，至於貴族式的家庭，固然有冰箱與其他各種設備，卽使腐敗，亦可任意捨棄，但是中流以下的家庭，在這米珠薪桂的時代，由汗血得來的錢，去買蔬菜，因經濟的關係，自然不能任意捨棄，可是大家都不知道保存的方法，遂把日常用剩的東西，不能經久多藏，失去新鮮的味道，這眞是可惜極了。他如魚肉類，應鑑别其顔色，牛豚肉以鮮紅色者爲上品。肉的地位，以背中部分爲最嫩，就是背骨與筋骨當中部分，臀肉是中等肉，脚肉爲下等肉，下等肉不易消化，而且營養分亦比較爲少，魚的選擇新鮮方法比較他物爲難，第一·看魚的鱗是否鮮艶用手觸之，不容易脫落的，第二·嗅魚的氣味，有否變更，第三·看魚的眼睛是否有光或向裏凹進，第四看魚腮的顔色是否鮮紅透明，第五用手指捺魚肉，若是手指離開魚肉，富有彈力仍舊能恢復原狀，是新鮮的，凹進不能恢復的，就已陳腐了，第六魚的肛門是淡紅色突出的，第七·魚腹不易拉破的，第八·臟腑没有露出的，第九·倘若放在水中，沉於水底的，是新鮮，浮於水面的，就腐敗了。</p>

<h3 id="c172">「風頭」辯 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>我一向寫文章，總是署眞實姓名的多：因爲身世多感，觸事而發，不免　着現實的癢處。自己說的話，自己來負責，免得牽累朋友：求其心安理得，本無借此「出風頭」之意。英英先生所謂「大出其風頭」，恕不領情。</p>
<p>靜觀人世，衆生所扮演的，不是悲劇便是喜劇。即如「愛也風頭」，亦未必天從人願。曹錕以賣布小商人高升是巡閱使，又做了大總統，人間富貴盡矣，可謂出盡風頭。民國十五年，北京招兵，即有人借此作爲號召幌子：當時必有許多夢想掛斜皮帶的。見此幌子，滿以爲從此即可博得一官半職以誇耀其鄕隣。但如衛延殘之沉妻殺子，自投黃浦：某參謀之欲拉黃包車而不可得；或落得别人憐歎，或落得别人訕笑，到此地步，方知都是「想出風頭」一念之誤。我的朋友Ｎ君，民國十三年，抑鬱不遇，遠走廣東，投入黃埔軍官學校：民國十六年間，自贛返浙，衣錦還鄕。好不威風丨乃有許多朋友，都要投筆從戎，晉京投考軍官學校。我說：「曹錕賣布出身，那是不錯的；但你莫忘記，袁世凱小站練」</p>
<p>兵，那時曹錕已是排長。由小站練兵而北洋大臣，由北洋大臣而民國總統：於是小站夥計，變成北洋巨頭；這個集團的發展，絶對不可忽過。古人謂因緣時會，時會是最要緊的；等到曹錕做了大總統，你再來「立正少息」那未免太遲了！」果然，斜皮帶掛了三年，又回家吃老米飯去。以想出風頭始，以大觸霉頭終，還讓我說一聲「不幸而言中」，當然是喜劇的一種。</p>
<p>又有想出風頭而果然出風頭的。三五年前。某君一個觔斗翻成Ｓ市的紅人，一呼百應，妻妾滿堂；朋友傳言，都說當今風頭之健，莫如某君，無奈不幾何時，又一觔斗翻成黑人，門前冷落車馬稀，誰也不去理會他。患得之時辛苦，患失之時艱難，孟亞聖倒成爲千百年前的預言家丨原來在内可以「驕其妻妾」，在外有許多「窮乏者得我」，所以多少人不知不覺迫上出風頭的路。在上路的時候「分付南湖舊花柳，好留烟月伴歸橈。」一到「東市朝衣一量休，北邙坯土」亦難留」只好說「悔之晚矣」。出了風頭，還不免扮演悲喜劇，那又從何說起？至於　否人物，古今都無佳果。孔家褒貶大師，一生栖栖皇皇，到處碰壁孔融心直口快，吾家孟德，就請他上斷頭台。阮籍稽康幽默兩祖師，雖天天吃酒吃藥，仍不免觸忌當局，說他們毁壞禮敎。眞是眞是殷鑒不遠，在夏后之世。近　稽康家誡，敎他的兒子做人要小心。有一條說長官處不可常去，亦不可住宿：官長送人出來時，你不要在後面，因爲恐怕將來官懲辦壞人時，你有暗中密告的嫌疑，又有一條說讌飲時候有人爭論，你可立刻走開，免得在旁批評；因爲兩者之間必有對與不對，不批評則不像樣；一批評就要是甲非乙，不免一方見怪。淸談老祖師都這樣不主張他的兒女　否人物。謂欲借　否以出風頭，人非至愚。當不出此。</p>
<p>風頭哲學的第一章，該是「少出風頭」才對。老子所謂「守雌」「守黑」，就是這個意思。若說做文章爲的出風頭，那我還不如擱筆的好。</p>
<h3 id="c173">花會的起源 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 李條</p>
<p>我前次談過花會。文中頗有咀咒花會之處。昨天再翻到井上紅梅的酒一麻雀鴉片，見有花會的起源一章。仔細看了一遍以後，恍然大悟我以前對於花會這一件有益的事業實在失敬了。急爲迻譯於此，以誌吾過丨</p>
<p>「花會的起源，傳說如左：</p>
<p>從前河南的洛陽橋還不曾造成時，两</p>
<p>岸人民覺得非常不便，常常祈禱，有人在這兒造成一座橋才好。玉皇大帝感動了，便把觀音菩薩召来，命她造成這條橋。觀音菩薩覺得没有經費，是非常困難的。種種法子都想遍了之後，她便祗好利用自巳的美貎，划了一隻船，停在江側，揚言誰能用銀子投到她身上的就嫁給誰。她這様的化成一様装飾的　十二個美廲的化身立在船頭。兩岸人民用無限的金錢向她投去，但一個都投不中。那時一個呌化道士來了。他從污穢的襪筒裏取出一塊銀子。向觀音菩薩投去。不獨投中了，而且不上不下剛好投在觀音菩薩的胸口。觀音菩薩怪極了，這呌化道士是誰呢？她揑指一算，原來是道敎祖師吕洞賓。於是觀音菩薩非常生氣地說：</p>
<p>「我是爲着人民的方便才這樣做的，你妨碍了我是不行的，現在我潔身引退，萬事都該你負責丨」這樣說過後，觀音菩薩的形體就消失了。吕洞賓闖了禍後仔細一想，這雖是討厭的事，但玉皇大帝的意旨要造的橋不造是不行的。於是東想西想，想出「花會」這個玩意來了。以前的賭博是只一個賠一個的，而押花會的，押中了的時候却一倍賠三十倍。因此那兒的男女老幼你也來賣我也來賣，頃刻便籌集了鉅額的金錢而架橋工事得以完成云。」</p>
<p>譯完井上紅梅的妙文後，我不禁想到今日中國觀音菩薩吕洞賓也確是非常多的。看呀，那些摟着摟着的大慈大悲的觀音菩薩不正在犧牲色相嗎？看呀，那畫着的大紙鳶下不明明註着五二○○○○元嗎？聰明的神仙爺爺吕洞賓花樣翻新，又想出一些變形的「花會」來了。</p>
<p>觀音大士，純陽祖師這些菩薩都一齊下凡了，中國怕還不會强盛起來！</p>

<p>快黑的時候，樓下忽然人聲　沸起來，七嘴八舌，聽不淸楚。訓　愛看熱閙，忙抛下手中裁剪未成的衣料，趕下樓去了。下面祇聽見一個人在衆口啧嘈雜中說，「乖乖，虧得天喛了呢。要不然，不淹死也得　死。┆</p>
<p>十分鐘以後，訓　帶着消息通通的跑上來了。一開口就說，「樓下賣雞鴨血的沈天錫跳了黃浦了。」</p>
<p>跳黃浦？我駭然起來。跳黃浦就是去尋死，自殺。他爲什麽會尋死的？於是聽訓貞說下去。她說：</p>
<p>「他跳下去又給水警救上來了。剛　警察來呌了二房東和他的侄女兒阿金去了。死活還不知道。」</p>
<p>只要是救上來了。大抵也就没有死。不然警察怎麽會知道他的家，來通知的呢？只有三天工夫這屋子裏又出了這麽一件大事了；前兩天　披間的女人生産，聽見婴兒哭，又聽見大人呼喊那女人的名字，不久又聽見家人的號啕說是死了。前後不到一圙鐘頭，這世界上有一條生命生下來又有一條生命死去。我當時想，　　生　　人　要用一條生命　　換取一條生命　　　　　　　　　　　　　是可以安安全全保存的。她那裏知道　人們是要拿生命去換生命的呢。</p>
<p>然而這裏又有一條生命在死綫上徘徊了一　。那生産的女人是爲了要換一條生命，那末，這又是爲的什麽呢？一到春去夏臨，　　上天天載着有人投黃浦的消息，大抵這一件消息，明天也不免要在報上發表了。往常報上的新聞，十九日標　爲「謀生不得┆」？十九也就是爲了要尋取生命而尋死。沈老　大約總出此例外了罷？然而我起了疑惑，想入非非：</p>
<p>沈老　是一個滿面笑容，一團和善的中年人，面黑身長，滿嘴鬍鬚。我們雖常向他做點生意，從他買六十或一百文的新鮮鷄鴨血，但交談不多。我有時深晚回來，訓貞不敢下樓，大半是由他來開門。他的床就開在樓下客堂間裏，白天把蚊帳收起來，床板豎在牆角。他没有妻室，妻室早死了；有一個十四五歲的侄女兒，在家洗衣燒飯，聽說是他從小帶大的，他淸早和上午出去做買賣，下午回家，和他做生意的時候，曾問過他一天能做多少生意，他說除開本，能赚四五吊錢一天。我們嘆爲好生意，。然而他的衣服破爛，補上加補，我們推想他是省儉過度，想貯蓄資財，重圓好夢。因爲他最多不過四十歲我所知道的就是如此。但他今天尋死我决定他不是「謀生不得」，因爲他一天能夠賺四五吊錢。</p>
<p>不久又從下面通通的上來了。　什麽　　　　　的，　　竟不知道。我　　　在指　中　　的香烟出神，想探索這投水自殺的死因。訓貞挨着我坐下，說：</p>
<p>「沈老　没有死，現在進醫院了。阿金剛　回來。昨天過端節，沈老　是昨天出去的。臨走時要阿金去代他做一天生意，他有事過浦東去。賣好的錢，好好的收着，回來要是再不見他回來，就收拾東西，自家回常州鄕下好了。沈老　是早準備尋死的。」</p>
<p>「他爲什麽尋死，知道了罷？」</p>
<p>「據二房東說，他欠印子錢太多，賺的錢還」不夠付息，他常說要尋死，或離開上海，昨天出去，阿金還道他躲債哩」。</p>
<p>原來如此。沈老　雖然賺四五吊錢一天，終也逃不出「謀生不得」之例。然而他如今又謀死不能了。這生命，眞無法處置。</p>
<p>第二天沈老　回來了，仍舊是面孔黑黑的，一嘴鬍鬚，但臉上的笑容却收歛了。我看見他的時候，心裏想，他是從死綫上回來的麽？然而他照常的做生意。阿金拿了一塊銀洋，告訴訓貞，這錢就是他那天臨走帶在身上，到水中打了一轉還没落掉的錢。順貞說那貼在上面用紅紙剪成的　字，已褪了顔色。那當然是水浸透了的緣故，沈老　的心，我想，也多少和這個紅字一樣。褪了一點色了罷？</p>
<p>搬到這屋裏來不到一月，就看見兩件可悲的事：一件是拿一條生命去換來一條生命，一件是把生命在水中洗去了一點顔色。</p>

<p>羊</p>
<p>红　　鬚起初衹看見一些糢糢糊糊在跳動着的圓球。這些圓球發出震耳的，混雜的呌聲，正像一些小孩子在學校的兩操塲玩着似的。一個個球　在他的跨下，使他感着一點不快。另一圙圓球則在屋頂小窗投出的燈光底下猛　着。這是一隻小羊。紅蘿蔔鬚因爲自己被嚇了一跳而微笑着。他的兩眼在黑暗中漸漸習慣了，裏面的情形已可看得淸楚了。出産小羊的時期已經到了。每天早上，小作農巴酌耳可以添上兩三隻小羊。他發現牠們在那些母羊裏面徬徨着，呆頭呆腦的，身子豎在幾條硬直的脚上，正像四條　得狠粗的木頭一樣丨戰憟着。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚還不敢撫摸牠們。牠們却比較大胆，在他的鞋子上吮着。或口裏　着一根乾草，把前面的兩只脚踏在他身上。</p>
<p>那些琉和，生下來已經一個星期的，便猛力地伸展　部，在空中扭來扭去。那些生下來祇有一天的，身子狠　，常是跪倒下來，又狠有精神地站起。一隻剛剛養下的小羊在地上爬着，身上粘粘的還不曾舐過。牠的母親被充滿着水的，摇動着的袋子阻碍着，用頭把牠推開。「這是一個不好的母親！」紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>「在獸類也和在人類一樣呢。」巴酌耳說。</p>
<p>「她一定想要把牠交給奶媽哺養啦。」</p>
<p>「差不多是這樣的，」巴酌耳說。「有些小羊是要用哺乳瓶丨像我們在藥店買來的那種哺乳」</p>
<p>瓶丨喂養的。但這事不會持久，因爲母親會感動起來的。並且，我們還可以使得母親屈服呢，」</p>
<p>他抓住她的肩膀，把她　開來放在一個瓶子裏。他在她的頸上　上一個草做的領帶，如果她沈掉了。可以辯認出來。小羊跟隨着母親。母羊大聲地吃着草料，小羊微顧着，用軟弱的脚頂立起來，找奶吃，狠可憐似的，臉上蒙着一層戰動的凝汁。</p>
<p>「你以爲她她有變　比較慈悲的一天嗎？」紅蘿蔔鬚說？</p>
<p>「是啦，當她的下身好了的時候，」巴酌耳說：「她生産的時候狠痛苦過來。」</p>
<p>「但我還是覺得我的想頭不錯的，」紅蘿蔔鬚說。「爲什麽不把那小羊暫時交给另外一隻母羊哺養呢？」</p>
<p>「她會拒絶不受的。」巴酌耳說。</p>
<p>眞的，從羊棚四角發出來的，報告吃奶時間到了的母羊的呌聲攪成一片，這呌聲在紅蘿蔔鬚的耳裏是狠單調的，但由那些小羊聽來却有着奧細的差異，因爲每隻小羊都毫不紊亂地一直向自己母親的乳旁跳去。</p>
<p>「這兒絶没有偷小孩的母羊。」</p>
<p>「怪極了，這種羊類的家族本能。」紅蘿蔔鬚說，「牠們怎麽能夠分辦出味呢？”也許是因爲」</p>
<p>嗅覺敏銳的緣故罷。」</p>
<p>他差不多想把一隻羊的鼻子塞住試騐試騐看。</p>
<p>他把人和羊仔細比较起來，他想要曉得那些小羊的名字。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c176">復興我國蠶絲業之途徑何尙平 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>我國蠶絲業　落之原因，舉其　　大者，可分析如下：</p>
<p>國外者（一）世界經濟之不况；（二）日絲之傾軋；（三）人造絲一部分之排擠。</p>
<p>國内者（一）農村經濟　數；（二）利用科學方法改良桑，　種，絲等尙未普及；（三）中央及地方之政治能力，用於治本救濟蠶業者極　；（四）絲·繭·種·桑等之交易完全無相當组織；（五）健全中央研究蠶絲　之機關，尙付缺如。」</p>
<p>處此複雜之環境，欲求有效之對策，可分治標治本兩種途秉，同時並進。治標中之减免絲繭等稅，與各種獎勵方法，中央與江浙　省政府，業已次第實行，茲姑不必詳論。雖然，治標與治本二種辦法，　相互而行，否則各失其效而不能持久，必至半途而廢而後巳。今再將治本方策詳述如下：</p>
<p>按我國生絲向銷歐美，歐美市塲近年幾被日絲完全佔奪，其故有三；（一）生絲品質不純；（二）同等品質之絲數量過少，不能以應歐美市塲之需求；（三）成本過重，不能與人以廉價　爭。且此三種問題，有互相連帶之關係，故治本辦法，非同時解决之不可。解决途徑，可分農工商三路並進，以求達到價廉物美量多之目的。</p>
<p>甲農業方面：</p>
<p>絲之原料爲繭，繭之優劣貴賤純雜，關於植桑，製種，育蠶三者，能否應用科學方法，而有無相當之组織爲斷，故應同時進行者如下。（一）「植桑」實際情形；桑乃繭之原料，故必先求其價賤質良·按近年江浙蠶業繁盛之區，每畝桑田産葉，平均不及七八担，與合理桑園每畝可産二十餘担者較，僅有三分之一之生産，倘遇水災蟲害之年，或農民貧困，施肥不足之處，則生産尤微，因之葉質劣而成本重矣。（改進辦法；）於　桑改良已有相當程度之區域内，借　農民以桑秧肥料，並指導深耕，裁桑，除蟲之新法。（二）製種（實際情形；）改良蠶種之成績，已爲社會農民所公認，自無討論之需要，惟其數量尙少，供不應求，不能普及，是爲可　。按江浙皖三省，春秋兩季，年需蠶種約計一千二百萬張，現時所産者，不及百分之二十，其中尙有粗製濫造以充數者，而所需之　種十二萬張，亦未完全規定製造之機關。（改進辦法；）私立種塲，應由政府取締獎勵，同時並施。更擇相當地點，廣植種用桑園，招商製　，以補不　之種量，同時由中央設立試騐塲，爲品種之研究及統一，規定全國所用之品種，（三）「育蠶」（實際情形；）未經改良之蠶桑區域，農民所育土種，自催靑以至上簇，皆不合科學方法，其收成不及十分之一二。即使收獲略豐，而繭質亦劣，故育蠶方法，亟需指導。（改進辦法；）設立改良蠶桑模範區，組織育　合作社，以便普編指導農民育　方法，並在未設模範區之處，廣設指導所，可代農民消毒，催靑，稚　共育，並指導其改良上簇之方法等。（四）「改良收繭之組織」改良繭質於上述三項之外，收繭之组織，亦有極大之關係，收繭之組織不良，評價與繭質不能相稱，是卽無從獎勵　　，而提倡改良之進行，自受無形之障礙，目原料繭之品種　雜，所製之絲品位低落，而成本加重，此乃近年來絲廠業失敗最大之原因。故當用科學管理方法，改良收繭之組織評價務求適合，庶可以高價專收優繭，而　汰劣繭，更須注意於品種之純一，是則於上述三項之外，於改良繭質有關之一要鍵也。</p>
<p>乙·工業方面；</p>
<p>絲廠之成敗，關於原料繭者固極重大，已如上述，然機械之精良，管理之合法，亦屬重要。促進設立新式絲廠（多緖式緩速度之絲車）並改良舊式絲廠，以求增加高級生絲（八十三分以上之匀度）之産量，俾與日絲竸爭於歐美市塲，蓋因中日同级之生絲，在歐美市塲上華絲更易受人歡迎也。</p>
<p>丙·商業方面；</p>
<p>我國生絲，在國際市塲贸易毫無健全之組織，各　運銷，各自爲政，各不相謀，國内國外亦無運銷之機關，以負調查，推銷，宣傳之責任，與日本比較，未免相形見絀。故組織國際運銷機關及設立絲業金融機關爲之調劑，皆屬刻不容緩之舉。</p>
<p>歸納以上所述，　業則是裁桑，製種·育蠶·售繭；絲業則自農業·工業·商業，自始至終，縱橫相互，均須有一貫政策，一切皆有聯絡組織，方能達到最經濟之目的。一面利用我國固有絲質之優良，人工之低廉，土壤氣候之適宜，同時運用科學新法以進行，能如是，而其出品不能竸　於國際之市塲不能恢復當年之榮譽，其誰能信？</p>

<p>生絲現爲國際贸易品，視其輸出之增减，可以測一國絲業之　替，吾人觀下表，卽可想像吾國絲業近年之情况矣．</p>

<p>民國二十年一三六　一八六八四　六八○　四八二</p>
<p>民國二十一年七八　二一九三二　九三二　二五○</p>
<p>由上表，知吾國近來生絲之輸出，無論量的方面，價的方面，均係銳減。然與下表所列世界生絲消費最多之美國及輸出最多之日本數字對照比较之，則相差遠甚。（美國消費量及日本輸出量均不見減僅見價格之跌落）</p>

<p>民國廿一年五五三　八一八五四八　二三六三八二　八七八　六八九</p>
<p>由此吾人發生兩大疑問：㈠世界生絲消費額不減退，日本輸出如舊，何以吾國輸出獨少？㈡蠶絲業經營要素，吾國遠勝於日本，何以日本屢經絲價暴落之下，尙能維持以前之輸出量，而吾國則稍經打擊，即衰退不堪，難以自振，其故何歟？余意日本蠶絲業當局者，力謀生絲品質之向上，以適　歐美之需要，同時，努力生絲成本之輕減，以應付世界經濟衰落之潮流，其他尙有種種方面相關爲用，連環　助，方有今日之現象。吾國則不然，當　者除少數外，大都不能使成品隨世界潮流之需要而改進；成本不能隨經濟衰落而減低，日望政府之援助，當此國庫空虚之際，焉能常此救濟哉！深望　絲業當局者之　决，茲就　見略陳於後，以就正於當道。</p>
<p>爲國際　　品，且　服　　之　　品　在世界經濟　　　之下　　　　　　之者何提高，頗屬不易；現在只有在低落之絲價下，謀成本之輕減，品質之提高，以期輸出量之增加。</p>
<p>業蠶絲者，自裁桑養蠶起至生絲販賣止，均應根據上述之原則，謀蠶絲業自身之復興，斯爲要旨，至如何産生價廉物美之生絲？余於國際贸易導報第二卷第二號，吾國現代絲業問题之商確文内，已詳論之，茲就新感，述之於後㈠原料繭質問題生絲品質之良否，大部份係視原料繭品質統一與否爲轉移，過去中國蠶繭品種駁雜不良，以致成品不佳，繅折甚大，今後希望優良，適用，統一爲原則。現在江浙有蠶業聯合統制委員會，處理此事，前途頗有希望。</p>
<p>㈡蠶繭買賣問題生絲之成本，百分之七十五爲繭本，是謀生絲成本之輕減，非使繭本低廉不爲功。當此絲價跌落，期貨約賣減少之際，行鮮繭買賣，絲廠固屬冒險極大，而農家蠶户因繭價時起　意識之誤會。不如改行乾繭買賣，以當時絲價爲標準，計算乾繭價格，則養蠶製絲兩方，利則同享，害則共負，整個蠶絲，保持共存共榮態度。不過此種乾繭買賣者，係由養蠶家將乾繭直賣於絲廠，决非江浙目下所行之餘繭商與絲廠之乾繭買賣也。惟行乾繭買賣之際，尚有兩種考慮之點：㈠蠶繭烘乾貯藏，須要械機技衛及適當倉庫，决非蠶户各家之力所能勝任，以目前狀况，非用合作方式行乾貯合作　之組織不可，政府立於指導輔助地位。㈡近年農産品廉價時代，農民經濟異常　迫，養蠶所得之繭，長期乾貯，待價而沽，殊非目下農民經濟狀况所能勝任，似非行乾繭押欵不爲功。此等零星乾繭押欵，希望目下銀行辦理，颇屬不易，不如以前之合作社代行押欵爲宜，但合作計焉有如此鉅欵，惟有希望政府担保合作社向銀行借欵，轉行乾繭押欵，似較易也。</p>
<p>㈢機械改造問題如有優良統一原料，求得均匀生絲之生産，非有妥善之加工不可。此種加工過程中，有完全恃女工之熟練技術者，如日本之郡是系統工廠；有恃優良機械之輔助者，如日本之片倉系統工廠。以近來江浙絲廠　况　之，　新式技術熟練之妇工，以製　良生絲　　不易，不如利用優良機械之輔助，反易生效，如杭州，　　，　山。　　，等絲廠之迅速　效者，　　於此。希望江浙絲商，　起而改用緩速度多條　之機械爲宜，（余在杭州絲廠試騐　式機械後，卽力勸江浙各絲廠改用之）</p>
<p>㈣經營革新問題過去江浙絲廠，大郡　廠營業，經營方式殊屬陳舊，今後應參照下列之　則，實行革新：</p>
<p>㈠經營者須作長久計劃；㈡關於增進生絲之　備及技術，應力謀改進；㈢　於　接生産之員工，　力加訓練。并注意其衛生保護敎育等㈣節省　費，優給生産者；㈤生産贩　　，　　合作以便大量之直接　出。</p>
<h3 id="c178">論中國的蠶絲業統制政策宗藩 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>蠶絲業統制的必然性</p>
<p>中國的蠶絲業，自從受了日本蠶絲業的壓迫，與最返幾年來國際經濟恐慌的影響，價格的慘落，輸出數字的低减，爲自有蠶絲業歷史以來未曾有的悲劇。各地絲廠的倒閉停工，且不必說，育蠶農民的虧　，由虧　而至於破産者十之八九，　身或甚至全家自殺者亦比比皆是，這是去年　　繭　收的年頭。</p>
<p>今年的情形怎樣？還没有確切的報告；但農民育蠶的更無利益可圖，絲廠商的經營也都在困苦艱難中掙扎，這是可以預料的。</p>
<p>中國的蠶絲業，終究没有希望了麽？那也不盡然。以日本爲例：他們的天然氣候，蠶繭品質，三來不及中國，而他們的工價之高，且超過中國二三倍，但他們能夠勉强維持者，是以上下一致的精神，統一蠶種，低减生産費用，原料繭一致製絲能力，改進生絲販賣統制等，簡單的說：便是技術的儘量科學化，經營的充分統制化，所以絲價雖然代减，而也口數量，還能相當維持。</p>
<p>在中國，雖然得有許多的天惠然而在一切育蠶，製絲販賣　各方面，毫無組織，毫無科學基礎。要謀蠶絲業的復興和發展，自然也祇有出路一條，便桑是關於一切的栽，製種育蠶，售繭，製絲乃至於對外贸易，無論爲技術的及經濟的，必須竭政府的全力，聯合一切農工商各方面，從統制的政策上，向前　進而已。</p>
<h3 id="c179">經濟統制政策的由來 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>經濟統制政策，現在不但是蠶絲業如此，其他的一切事業，其他的一切國家丨丨無論是社會主義國家的蘇聯資本主義國的英美，以及汎繫黨反統治的意大利等，都不能不採用這一種政策了。</p>
<p>在蘇俄社會主義的經濟政策還未成功以前，在世界經濟恐慌還没有十分尖銳化以前，支配整個的世界經濟者，是秉承着一貫的亞當，斯密斯的自由經濟主義的思想。他的口號是「：發展生産，獲取利潤，積　人的財貨，以增進國家的富源。」因這經濟思想的支配，所以小之在國内爲自由放任主義的經濟組織，大之在世界訂立自由贸易的條例。但從資本主義極度發展，國際間的經濟竸爭日趨劇烈以後，歐洲的空前的大戰，緣此而生。同時，因加塔兒　託拉斯，産業合理化等運動的發生，每一種的工業部門，成立了聯合的小的統制，對内以壓迫大多數的勞苦羣衆，對外與其他的資本主義國作正面的捕鬥，在相互的傾軋間，资本主義破錠逐漸暴　，空前的世界經濟恐慌，遂以發生。</p>
<p>統制經濟運動的産生，就是過去的自由放任主義的淸算，把一切　業在有秩序有計劃的統制之下，以整個的國家　一集團，内使資　勞動互相聯合，　自給自足的天地，外以防　各國的　害，或用這武　，以壓迫弱小的集團。這統制經濟計劃的運動，汎　主義的意國，在一五二六年卽已頒訂法律，着着進行。而蘇聯在一九二七年實行五年計劃的時候起，其成績之優異，且　動了全世界的一切國家了！</p>
<p>就蠶絲業而論，意國的組織　絲業改進委員會，日本的實行各種統制方法等，都已舉有顯著的實績。</p>
<h3 id="c180">中國蠶絲業統制的歸趨 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>在中國的現狀下，要求桑園的改良，蠶種、統一，繭　的低减，絲質的優長，以及市價的增高等，自然也除農工商的各方面，在政府的指導監督之下，作有計劃有系统有步驟的進展不可。</p>
<p>江浙兩省政府，在最近一二年來，確是依照着上述的方向在進行。本年又復組織江浙蠶絲業統制委員會，聞已决定了相當的步驟，預備作積極的邁進了。</p>
<p>但我們希望政府及蠶絲業界同人，在進行統制的經濟運動時，切弗忘了爲蠶絲業最中堅的農民的利益！俄國的統制經濟政策，當然爲全體的民衆謀福利，絲毫不雜有個人打算的色彩，便是意大利的汎繫主義的統制經濟運動，其最重要的目標，也定有停閉阻害生産的資本家工塲；增加全勞動者的利潤；取締銀行及交易所之暴利等各件。簡括的說，這種統制經濟運動，其目的在以整個的國家力量，内興産業，外抗侵略，一面要昭蘇在崩潰中的農村經濟，一面要抵抗國外的絲業竸爭，所以要爲整個的蠶絲業界謀利益，决不能爲少數的工廠主和少數的製種家得利潤！</p>
<p>過去的改良蠶種的高價出售，使無力購種者不能亨受利益。浙江餘杭臨安各處農民的反對新式製種。雖然據官報有舊式製種商在從中簸弄，但執行者的精神，不以使民衆了解，終不能不辭其咎。而最近的繭價的制限，雖然也是迫不得已的辦法。但如果不能先把農民育蠶的成本上作根本的打算，爲農民的生活上作整個的計劃，一味祇是抵價，這仍舊是病民，去近代的所謂新的經濟運動丨丨統制經濟運動，相去仍是極遠，所謂改良蠶絲業也者，或將成爲一名詞而已。</p>
<h3 id="c181">日本蠶絲業統制之借鑑毓 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>號　蠶絲事業鼻祖之中國，最近以來，空負其四千餘年歷史的盛譽，一　不振。而蕞爾小島之日本絲業，無論其生産方面，贸易方面，都一躍而居世界第一位，日人之所以有如此地位，决不是由於幸運和偶然，而是由於過去數十年中的奮鬥和努力。本文思將日本蠶絲統制，作一簡略叙述，以供我絲繭業之借鑑。</p>
<p>一，蠶絲品質向上的統制</p>
<p>明治初年，爲防止粗濫造，及與法意等先進國家竸爭起見，政府所採行品質向上的統制，係㈠製絲業由國家設立生絲檢查所，檢查輸出生絲，各道縣府及絲業組合，也設立生絲檢查機關。㈡養蠶業（甲）由蠶業取締所，蠶種業組合等，强制施行蠶種檢查。（乙）蠶種及　育法方面，㈠設蠶業試騐塲，㈡津貼幼蠶共同飼育所，及共同桑園等，㈢由民衆自動組織蠶種分場經營和特約組合等。</p>
<p>二，大規模化的統制</p>
<p>經營大規模化的統制，是以組合，共同設施，以及其他法律的統制，補足蠶絲業小規模經營下列的缺點。㈠組製濫造，喪失信用；㈡時有生産過剩的危險，以致濫賣發生絲價繭價的慘跌，無異自殺；㈢不能像大規模事業有統制市價能力；市價常漲落不定；㈣同業間缺乏統制，以致共同獲得原料和販賣製品等大量交易的利益，無從均　；㈤購入原料和販賣製品間，有中間商人之分利。蓋自近來，小規模經營者；一方面受在資本的壓迫，他方面又受絲價低落的犧牲，是欲免除此項痛苦，非具有共同　蠶二部分以簡單說明如左：</p>
<p>（一）製絲業（甲）依據政府法律而組織的，如産業组合製絲，在明治十年已開其端，當時手工製絲家（即蠶户）爲達到一定輸出量起見。共同投資製絲，所謂結組製絲是也。至明治三十三年頒佈産業組合法，更給與　種團體以法律爲根據。政府復予以免稅優待，并給　金融上的種種便利。製絲方法，也從人工改爲機器。同時含有排除中　商及製絲家　於蠶户的壓迫。昭和二年，組合製絲業設立大日本生絲販賣組合聯合會，以所　　合的生絲，直接售於輸出商。最近又發表擴充計劃，想從現在年生産能力的二萬二千担，於五年之間，增爲四萬四千担又預期於昭和十年起，在紐約設立推銷處，以便與美國直接交易。（乙）由政府設補助金津貼絲業，促進製絲業的發展。如昭和七年臨時議會議决，於十年中付獎勵金二百六十萬元，第一次十二萬元，已於昭和七年度　付。（丙）由當事人自動組織，如大日本蠶絲會等。（丁）由法律制限，規定新設事業的最小限度；昭和七年九月頒佈十月實施的製絲業法規定機械製　業須得農林大臣的認可，新設機械工塲，至少須一百五十　，否則不予批准。</p>
<p>（二）豢蠶業（甲）依據政府所公佈的法律而组織者，有養蠶業組合，蠶種業組合等。以统一蠶種，指導養蠶，檢查　繭，改善繭的交易方法，預防蠶病，調解蠶業糾紛，以及改良　業其他方面爲業務。（乙）由政府津貼産業組合所組織的共同蠶繭倉庫，目的在安定繭價，施行大規模的乾繭保管，并防止蠶户因資金困難而抛賣。據查，昭和七年度受政府津貼的已有六十五團體。此外復預貸以金錢。（丙）由當事人自動發起實施分塲經營辦法。（丁）由法律制限，規定新設蠶種業的最小限度，昭和四年蠶絲業法施行細則，規定蠶種業須具有一定設備，并每年不得少於十萬蛾。否則不准設立。</p>
<p>三，企業及原料獨佔的統制</p>
<p>製絲業旣脫離養蠶業而發展爲獨立的工業。製絲家最關心的就在如何獲得低廉而優美的原料。尤其從　區虽以後，絲價低落，絲的産額未减，而利潤已經縮小，製絲家爲維持往日地位起見，一方面圖製絲技　的進步，增大製絲效　，同時更關心優美的原料，以謀絲質的向上。因此製絲家和養蠶家締結特約，獨佔原料繭的　買權，而由製絲業自己統制繭的品質，統製之法，共有三種，㈠以現金預先貸於蠶户，防止　户以蠶　售於外人。㈡令蠶户　　對於製絲家最有利的特種品種，及㈢派遣養蠶指導員，敎以一定的　養方法，更確保絲質的向上。　昭和三年調　締結特約的製絲　塲，共二零七　，特約養蠶　　　　　　　　　八四。</p>
<p>近來絲價　　非是上　的　　，而　根本的低　。故如何　止絲　的　　　　，爲當前　絲　的　急問題。　人的統制方法：</p>
<p>（一）絲價（甲）由　絲當　　共同協力，限制在一定以下價格出賣，并禁止　期市塲買賣，防投機者　縱市塲，如　　絲中央會和絲　大會的議决，可以限制生産，也先貸以欵項，以便待價而沽，（乙）銀行等對　絲　集團，特别通融　欵，但　　迫實施絲價對業起見，停止因製絲而起的放欵。（丙）由政府出　，補償　絲業的損失，并爲蠶絲業向银行斡旋，獲得放欵，再由政府收買生絲，提高絲價。</p>
<p>（二）繭價（甲）由政府以低利放欵，貸於蠶户，供給基緊急需要，并發出補助金，設立繭庫及共同乾繭保管庫。（乙）由縣道府對於繭市場，繭倉庫，及養蠶組合等，貸出欵項。</p>
<p>大體而論，日本現行蠶絲統制法，限於以上所舉四種。其中一二兩項成績爲最著。而所以有如此成績，半由於政府的提倡，津貼，和補助，半由於人民的自動組織未來的發展，方興未艾，返顧我國，不勝寒心。</p>

<p>而今是夏臨了，「炎日當空」是夏的唯一　　，也就象徴着「暴日臨頭」，聽說炎日當空的時候，哥兒小姐可有電扇驅熱，懶慵慵的不在意下，貧苦的羣衆，也大可赤了膊，拏着一把團團的蒲扇，「撲，撲的打風，也就不難抽一口風凉的氣，然而「暴日臨頭」，計將焉出，</p>
<p>而我所最躭心的，究竟還是那些大人先生，闊老　家，在這夏之神臨了，雖　電扇在側，免不了還要連聲的呌道：「熱，熱，熱，」於是乎就有尋幽避暑的雅舉，那才夠舒胸曠懷，益壽延年。北載河　陽熱河┆┆就都是些幽美的避暑地帶，而今這些錦繡河山，率淪敵手，怎不呌我們代喚一聲奈何天，「避暑焉適」？廬山牯嶺莫干山說不定定懸掛「客滿」的牌頭，靑島尙屬可以，秦皇島也一樣不可去矣。</p>
<p>而今是夏臨了，在這夏的開篇的五月，更是一葉一葉的血史在翻騰，「五三」「五七」「五九」「五卅」，原都是這夏的賜予，時序的點綴。國人不可忘也。聽說都要舉行哀痛的紀念。一般閒散的大人先生，又要勞駕勞駕，在我們的總理遺像前，頂禮三鞠躬，說不定還有一篇沉痛的訓词。</p>
<p>學校照例也要按日放假，一般救國呼聲最高的學生同胞，眼見會雀躍三百，喜不自禁，跳舞連上救國，XX也可連上救國，看呀，海上的酣歌　舞，影戲遊藝，多少又要因此而轉機，而營業發達吧。</p>

<p>幾個不同類的問題</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我的環境很不好，受了兩年初中敎育，就輟學了。今春來滬，在一家商店裏當一個小小店員。現在有　件事情，請敎先生，望　賜示。（甲）我或覺我的國文程度，太差一些應酬實感困難，想從國文方面研究一下，不知要買些什麽書籍來看？（乙）法律常識，我們應該也要　得一點，我也想買幾種普通法律書籍來看，不知以那些爲好？（丙）現在湖南發行救國　　，承　的數目，以財産的多寡爲標準。舍下不滿五千元的家産，邑中有一二劣紳，總說舍下的家産，在一萬元以上，應照一萬元以上的家産承募。家伯曾向縣政府請求，切實調查，以期平允；但政府與劣紳，是一氣的，不肯依家伯的請求。累得家伯走頭無路，這件事情到現在還未解决，使我焦急之至。務望先生代我想個解决的辦法。（丁）先祖在時，曾私人創立一個慈善會。有田八十餘畝，歷年來把每年所有的收入，專做地方的慈善事業。此種産業，除完納正餉和地方附加稅外；應該不應該擔任其他的捐派？敬叩</p>

<p>楊素雲　謹上（五月二十九日）</p>
<p>編者按：查國文一道，精深玄奥，直無底止。不過除了少有文學天才，並且環境容許其精研者外；其他一般人，祇救其文筆淸順，詞能達意足以應用罷了。照來信看來，尙不失爲通順，但遇事情稍涉複雜，意思略爲曲折之處，不免有詞不達决之苦。能虚心探究，當然很好；不過足下已執業社會，第天能致力於自修的時間，想必不多，而一個人應當研討的東西，又如此之多。所以我們勸你不必專爲了國文，買幾本書來讀。好在中國人對於國文接觸的機會很多，譬如每天看的日報，各種有價値的雜誌，以及介紹各種學識的書籍。牠們都能將很複雜的事情，很曲折的意思。用很簡潔的文字，寫出來。你祇須在閱讀的時候，細心體會，同樣這一件事情同樣這一層意思，我寫起來，是不是能夠這樣清順明晰。這樣你一方面旣可得到很多學　，一方面國文的程度，也可以日進於無形了。</p>
<p>法律常識，誠然是每一個法治國的國民，應當知道的。現在把我一時想得到的有價値的介紹幾本在下面。㈠會文堂出版，郭衛編的「法律常識」，你大可以買來一看。這本書的内容，並不十分豐富；但是牠能把法律的各部，都有相當的介紹，並且能夠在法律上，有所研討，所以在没有看過法律書的人，第一部看牠，是最適宜了。㈡「刑法學總論」㈢「刑法學各論」。這兩部書，也是會文堂出版，郭衛律師編的。　們對於「中華民國刑法」，非但有很詳細的解剖；並且還根據學理，論其得失，也是不可不看的。至於民法，手續法，以及其他等等，或則過於複雜，或者非一般國民所必需的常識，恕不一一介紹，好在「法律常識」一書裏，都有適當的書本介紹，如其有志精研的話，可以照牠的指示，去買來研究。</p>
<p>國民對於國家，倘使感覺到牠眞有可愛的地方，那麽到了國難臨頭的時候，自然會慷慨捐輸，致力於救國的一途。可憐我們幾十年來的中國，被一般執政者的倒行逆施，弄到一般人民，對於國家，有點頭痛，愛國心實在無由而發生。所以這種救國公債，竟不行不出於硬派的一法，已經是可憐到十分十二分了。但是尙可說國難臨頭，無可如何；假使執行的人，還要上下其手，不公不法，那麽將來國民對於國家的觀念，便會一天一天的更形失望　起來。所以這種事情，非但影響於一家的負擔，而且簡接還有害於國家的前途。這件事，宜抵死反抗，萬一他用政府的力量來壓迫，也惟有出於祈願的一法。</p>
<p>至於私人設立的慈善機關，在法律上稱爲「財團法人」，於「自然人」立於同等的地位。所以對於公衆的一切一切義務，有平均擔任的必要。</p>

<p>二十二·兩巨頭</p>
<p>門外一陣熟悉的汽車喇叭聲，武貴谨愼好親自去開門，原來是蘇部長和一個客人來了。這一個客人就是台灣銀行的華經理顧先生，也是武貴完全知道的。</p>
<p>他們前後的走下車來，老爺的緞袍還在踏板上拖了一下。只有顧經理穿的是黑色的西裝，當然不至於掃踏板，不過高頂的黑色洋帽子却又在車蓬上碰了一下。</p>
<p>巳經是晚上的十點鐘了，他們還高興的跑來，當然又是在舞塲裏跳了一通無疑，因爲顧經理從來就愛和洋人交際，所以一切行動也都洋化起來了。剛剛走進大廳，老爺便一疊連聲的問：</p>
<p>「太太呢？太太呢？到那兒去了？」</p>
<p>「她說老爺又不來，悶得慌，看影戲兒去了。」</p>
<p>武貴很謹愼的站在旁邊回話。只見老爺笑笑的看了顧經理一眼，鼻子裏哼了一聲，看上去，似乎不大高興似的。其後只聽得顧經理很俏皮的說：「想不到耕翁到老來還走着桃花運哪，你看你一不來，果然那絶世美人就」</p>
<p>不免要悶得慌，眞是怪可憐的。」</p>
<p>「笑話笑話！」</p>
<p>快樂的笑，得意的笑，可是又得向武貴使眼色。武貴自然懂得官塲中的規矩，馬上便誠惶誠恐的退下來了。然而也不敢遠遠的跑開，恐怕要遞茶遞水，没有人答應；祇好靜靜在門外待着。不過從門隙裏總還可以聽着他們的談話的聲音。但是說得很低，加之顧經理又說的是東洋話，武貴當然莫明其妙，然而有時出夾着中國话在内，什麽「條约」「計劃」之類，在武貴想當然是機密的國家大事，用不着他也來過問。但是自己的老爺却說的是官話，不過也說得很低，聽不大淸楚。據武貴所曉得的，蘇部長不但是可以說日本話，而且能夠說法語。然而却不說，大槪是因爲老了的原故，懶得麻煩，當然外國話總没有家鄉話來得便當的。然而武貴到底也小心的偷聽了幾句：</p>
<p>「┆┆這一點正和我的意思一樣：我以爲假使能這樣照着計劃的合併立國，的確是可以使白種人大吃一驚的。眞的亞洲聯盟起來┆┆可是這事情總覺得不易下手。同時這一點活動費到底總還不夠。┆┆」</p>
<p>武貴聽來：没有什麽意思，看看身上的掛錶，巳經是十一點三刻，太太總該回來了，於是立刻走到門口告訴門房說：</p>
<p>「你得小心守着，回頭太太回來的時候，你得告訴她老爺在裏面等着，敎」</p>
<p>張大少爺打　花　裏的那道門進去。┆聽淸楚了嗎？」</p>

<h3 id="c198">有錢女子在銀幕上的可能 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 遜南</p>
<p>欲成明星必須勤苦自勵</p>
<p>富家女子缺少振作精神</p>
<p>富家的女子，能否在銀幕上，成爲明星？這是一個很費思索的問題在炭精燈光下工作。固然除了大批的金錢收入之外。還有洋溢乎宇宙的名氣可以享受。所以有許多人以爲投身影戲事業的，不必專爲利而來，亦可爲求名而去的，没有錢的，爲錢而來，但是有錢的人，亦可爲名而來。這話說得似科很近情理，但是事實上却不然。有錢的女子，一時興之所至，跑到好萊鳱，非但靠了金錢的勢力，及衣裝的煊赫，並且連生得美麗的面貎，娉娜的身叚的女子，亦都失敗了。什麽原因呢？表演不是容易的事，非但可自己刻苦用功，並且還要受盡導演及同伴們的氣，積年累月的熬煉出來，纔得成爲一顆發光體。所以没有錢的女子，看了已成名的明星們，整千整萬的拿薪水，心中羡慕着而自己鼓勵着戰戰兢兢地向上爬着，漸漸地出人頭地而成爲星體。至於有錢的女子呢，一來舒適慣了的，自然不能淬勵筋骨，刻苦上進，再則旣不缺少金錢，自然不羡慕别人的大薪俸，而少了一種前向的推動力。</p>
<p>至於天才的女演員，自然又當别論。但是，那裏來許多天才而不須經過操練的呢？不過有些女子聰明些，比别人上進得快些，於是大家，就稱她爲「天才」罷了。克萊拉寳，葛雷泰嘉　，瓊克勞馥，不都是操練出來的嗎？</p>
<p>現在好萊　有一位新進的女演員呌安特琳愛姆絲（ＡＤＲＩＥＮＮＯＯ　ＡＭＥＳ）。他放棄了她富有的家庭，跑到好萊塢，立志要成一明星。她將以前有錢女子在好萊塢失敗的種種原因，細細分析了一下。她明白有錢的害處，刻苦上進，現　已漸露頭角，而做了希佛萊的配角了。她自己說他到好萊塢並不是因爲一時的興致，而係因爲她要能自立面有作爲；她能持久的工作下去不因些小的成就而中　止，所以她前途是很有希望的。但是她初到好萊塢的時候，誰不拿她當作一位闊票友看待？誰肯鄭重考慮他的意思呢？</p>
<p>安特琳在未入影界之前，在紐約的交際界，已是享了盛名的。他的丈夫是一位垣街有名的掮客，很有錢的。但是他第一次結婚是完全失敗的。恐怕他第一次婚姻中所受的痛苦，巳經堅定了他　身電影的志願，以至第二次結婚的美滿，亦没有能打消他的志向！這是極堪佩服的。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c199">評「情海波漾ＴＨＥ　ＷＯＭＡＮ　ＡＣＣＵＳＥＤ」 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>若是我們和美國片常時接觸的話，那末很容易發現這黃金國的電影藝術家對於故事的結構，常是不十分考慮，而在畫面上却常是極力炫耀着他們的富麗，奢侈。也可以說，這便是美國電影的特徴。</p>
<p>即以這「情海波澜」爲例，那末自不難得着充分的證實。少女葛蘭妲，正在準備着與其未婚夫在海船上結婚，她的舊情人却從中阻撓，以命其槍手殺她的未婚夫而相要脅，並且立即電話槍客，很明顯的這是不通，難道在電話中也可談殺人的秘密嗎？當時少女困憤恨而以銅像擊之竟死。其後女以實情告其女僕，女僕不顧自身之受牽連，而使女逃遁。這也是很勉强的，我不信有忠僕能如此不畏死者。後來死者的友人代其伸寃，證明殺人兇犯確爲葛蘭妲。可是法庭却不受理，說是證據不足。這眞是和莊嚴的法律開玩笑了，難道法律這東西有時也可以大發慈悲而任罪犯逍遥法外的嗎？當然這是編劇者過於多情一定要使「有情人皆成眷屬」的原故。但是讓這所謂美滿的婚姻來一個悲劇的收塲，不是更能動人的嗎？雖然證明了死者曾經「預謀殺人」但是「誤殺」者也得判幾年徒刑的吧？如上所述，我們並非爲他們的法律而護道，不過是要說明他們的矛盾罷了。</p>
<p>然而整個的畫面却可顯出演出的技巧已經純熟。導演ＢＡＹＡＴＤ　ＶＥＩＬＬＥＲ將全部劇情都運用得非常生動，使我們一點也不覺得沉滯。這裏有奢華的佈景，美麗的攝影。特别是那船上的游泳一個塲面，導演要將他們自己富麗的生活，盡情的炫耀出來。固然這是黃金國電影所必具的條件然而也正是他們醜惡的暴露。至於少女之未婚夫，使力的鞭撻死者之兇手，却是非常好的塲面。同時這樣一來，便使劇情急轉直下，自然是巧妙的手法。不過重要的轉折，都藉對白說明，所以對於不懂英語的觀衆，到底是多少減低興趣的了。</p>
<h3 id="c200">評「靑春之火」ＦＬＡＭＥＳ <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>假如我們要找一個形容詞來描寫男女間熱情的話，那末，火ＦＬＡＭＥ確是一個相當適合的字。也許還有更好的象徴熱情的字句，但是「靑春之火」一片中却完全以火爲配襯了。</p>
<p>本片的劇情簡括叙述之如次，有兩個救火會員因爲替二個少女自一電杆柱上救下了一隻貓，遂彼此認識了，誰知這二位仁兄，對於二女一見鍾情，設法和她們接近。於是經過　次交談，加之看電影而且游公園，一對巳經成功，而另外的一對却是半推半就。雖然男的是熱情如火，可是女的却受了她的經理威脅利诱，反面怨恨情人的粗暴。其後因着ＯＦＦＩＣＯ的失火，經理感謝情敵救火員的救命之恩，而這一對靑年男女也就從此結婚了。</p>
<p>就故事的結構說，當然不免有過於「巧合」的地方，如居然是這一個寫字間突然失火，而這因於火燄中的女人也居然等待着情人到來才能護救。（因爲在情人未到之先，早已有救火車來了，可是不先救人而只顧救火，當然，也許這都是虚構的故事中在所難免的吧。然而我們對於這些也不必存着何等奢望，因爲電影製作者不一定都是寫實主義者的原故。至於爲了一隻貓而喊救火車，以及爲了一隻小鳥而不惜往火熖鑽去，事實上也是出於情理之外的穿插，令人不敢置信。然而據對白告訴我們，那是譏笑救火會的生命不及一隻小鳥，（因爲爲了小鳥有一人跌死的原故）那末，我們也只好爲之摇頭嘆氣了。</p>
<p>前後有兩次救火的場面，確是非常好看。紅的火，黑的烟，女人的呼救救火車的咆哮，雜踏的人羣，救火員的拚命，使我們觀衆儼如身歷其境，興　而且緊張。然而導演關於所謂「熟情」的描寫，却是十分不夠。假如以其　比大火的話，那末顯然這「靑春的「火」反而一點也不熾烈事實上這靑年男女並不熱情，至於笑料的穿插，毫無精采。特别是最後火熖正高的時候。救火員不去救火，反而把着女人狂吻，直是太不合理，他於經理在被救之後，立刻向情敵道歉，也未免過於生硬。</p>
<p>關於表演，無甚可取，比較的那個滑稽的女角，却能給人以不忘的印象。可是镜頭假如更艰靈活的話，那末攝影方面確是比較好的。總之，本片的演出，並不敎人過於失望，假使我們也需要烈熖來剌激神經的時候。</p>

<p>— 魯道夫梅蘇氏著抱寒譯</p>
<p>蘇俄之電影事業，頗有前進之趨勢，且無時無刻不在計劃試騐之中。惟以前關乎藝術之名言，在現在之蘇俄電影界以及戲劇界，巳無人重視，電影與戲劇對於藝術之本身，亦莫不關心。現估之蘇俄，視敎充及宣傳爲主，而以藝術爲其奴。苟抽象中之藝術　藝術之作品。可利用以資宣傳者，則竟利用之，若一旦失其用，則棄之若浼矣。</p>
<p>有啓夫攝影塲者，現正從事於ＤＯＮ　ＯＵＩＸＯＴＥ之攝製。此劇爲一表演衣裝之影片，其影片本事之内容。亦與原書無甚出入蓋以宣傳而言，該刻本事實無加以增删之必要也。惟莫斯科之愷末南戲院，今春排演莎士批亞之海姻勒（ＨＡＭＬＥＴ）時，竟將劇本大加穿　，以求適合蘇維埃銷場之用，致表演中之劇憎與原文大相徑庭，如謂海姆勒之殺克勞迭斯（ＣＬＡＵＤＩＵＳ）毫無個人之企圖，而是革命之行爲，欲爲貧民除一奸惡之壓迫者云云、。再則爲著重此種意義起見復謂劇中之鬼，完全爲海姆勒所造作以期　惑軍隊共　大舉者云云。</p>
<p>俄人在相當範圍内，亦頗願引證古藉之事蹟，但亦以能否使此種事蹟與五年計劃之普通精神發生多少關係爲歸依。如莎翁之戲劇「羅密與仇麗」（ＲＯＭＥＯＡＮＤ　ＪＵＬＩＯＴ）其本　絶頂浪漫者，蘇俄絶無所用之。此意在蘇俄影界劇界。巳一再聲明，即余個人亦已親聆影劇二界書局人一再言之矣。</p>
<p>至如莎翁又一名作如歐散羅（ＯＴＢＯＬＬＯ）者，蘇俄著名製作家曾告余，此劇近代之替代品爲ＬＥＣＯＣＵ　ＭＡＧＮＩＦＩＱＵＥ，該劇雖爲値未經證明之比利時作品，然在俄國之舞台上，巳居然能奪一代宗匠傑作之拉而代之矣。</p>
<p>再則「卡門」在現代蘇俄尙有繼續存在之勢。「卡門」之劇情究竟合乎五年計劃之精神與否，茲不敢斷言。再則畢散（ＢＩＺＯＴ）歌劇之近代製作，亦未經何等修改吾人實無從斷其成敗之因，故祇可謂「卡門」等，亦不過如哈羅勞易之作品，偶然混跡影界遂年牢不可拔之勢耳。證諸卡門與哈羅勢勞易二人日常之行徑吾語亦頗恰當也。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">No Specific Measures Yet for Handling the Puppet Troops <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Main Force Has No Withdrawal Plans</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Disturb Villages Regularly</p>
<p>Okamura Goes to Changchun to Report Signing of the Treaty to Mutō</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, Xiong Bin and others negotiated with Nakamura in Tianjin on the issue of disposing of the puppet troops. The Japanese side is unwilling to take in the puppet troops from eastern Hebei. The Japanese side also made no definite statement regarding our proposed reorganization of them. Therefore, no specific agreement has been reached. After taking over various areas, the number of security forces in each county will be based on the standard of being able to suppress bandits and maintain peace, approximately one hundred men per county, not interfering in local affairs, and being co-organized by local self-defense groups or village alliances. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issues of Japanese troop withdrawal and resolution of the puppet troops after the ceasefire have no explicit stipulations in the agreement and rely on private negotiations. Our representative Xiong Bin and others went to Tianjin a few days ago to discuss with Commander Nakamura. Mr. Xiong returned to Beiping on the evening of the 3rd to report. It is said that there is no set period for the withdrawal of the Japanese troops, and it is of an automatic nature. The Japanese side only stated that it would implement it within a short period of time and absolutely fulfill the obligations of the agreement. After negotiation, Nakamura agreed to ask Okamura for instructions and then reply with the exact withdrawal date. The rumor that the Japanese troops had begun to withdraw towards the Great Wall line on the 4th is not yet true. Regarding the resolution of the puppet troops, the Japanese side firmly stated that they would allow us to dispose of them freely, but it is difficult to start before the Japanese troops in the east have withdrawn. Moreover, there are many difficulties in resolving them. Both sides are still continuing detailed discussions. Mr. Xiong will go to Tianjin for further negotiations within two days. (4th Central Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo is currently stationed in Yangcun, and Li Jichun is extorting 30,000 yuan in Tangshan. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Tongxian reports that the Japanese troops on the left bank of the canal east of Tongxian City are entrenched in the Yanjiao Town area and have not yet prepared to withdraw. The Japanese and puppet troops on the Jian'gan River have built solid defensive works. The puppet troops regularly come out to disturb the villages. The Japanese troops near Xianghe and Baodi have also not withdrawn. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Okamura went to Dalian on the 14th destroyer from Tanggu Pier No. 14 on the morning of the 4th and will then go to Changchun to report the signing of the ceasefire agreement and subsequent events to Mutō. Nakamura will handle matters on his behalf. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Since a preliminary peace has been achieved in Beiping City, the authorities have issued an order today to all district offices to remove all defensive sandbags piled up at the entrances of various streets and alleys. The Japanese and puppet troops east of Lutai have not yet withdrawn, and the Beining Railway is still open to Lutai. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Jiang recently received telegrams from Song Zheyuan and Sun Dianying refuting rumors. Song's telegram states, approximately: Anti-Japanese resistance lies in practical action, not lofty pronouncements. If anti-Japanese resistance is used as a pretext to create disputes, wouldn't that please the enemy? At this critical time of national crisis in Hebei Province, a sudden incident occurred. I only know to obey your commands to save the crisis. I dare not hear of anything else. I will immediately entrust Commissioner Xiao Zhenying to report everything to you in person. Please investigate and understand, etc. Sun's telegram states, approximately: Yesterday, I received a telegram from Shi Shiping stating that Mr. Feng entrusted fifteen general commanders, with Chairman Song as the first route and Kuiyuan as the second route, etc. I was extremely surprised after reading it. I have already sent Li Jinxiang, the head of the Central Propaganda Team, along with Han Linfu to report to Beiping. Kuiyuan was completely unaware of this matter beforehand. At this critical time of life and death, why engage in internal strife? In the past, due to Tan's affair in Malan Valley, the people of the country regarded me as a bandit, and the central government regarded me as a traitor. Therefore, I often took extreme measures. Recently, due to my efforts in resisting Japan, the people of the country have greatly praised me, and the central government is relying heavily on me. I have entered a path of light. How could I be so insane as to damage my own reputation? Kuiyuan supports the central government and vows to have no other intentions. Please do not worry about it.

<p>The Situation in North China Will Not Be Affected</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A responsible authority said to someone, Feng advocated resisting Japan, but he did not launch it during the fierce battle against Japan, but on the day of the ceasefire. I don't know what his intention is. In terms of party discipline, Feng is both a member of the party and a member of the Central Committee. If he has any opinions, he should first contribute them to the central government. All actions should be based on the party's orders. Otherwise, everyone will act freely, and the steps will be messy and the strength will be dispersed. Not only will there be no way to resist Japan, but it will also mislead the country and create opportunities for the enemy. It is reported that he has appointed administrative commissioners without authorization and levied taxes privately. The central government is investigating. Currently, the central government still hopes that Feng has no other intentions. Otherwise, he will be condemned by the people of the country. The generals stationed in Beiping from the Northwest do not agree with Feng's actions and have sent telegrams to the central government to express their sincerity. Therefore, they believe that the situation in North China will not be affected. (4th Dispatch)</p>

Sun stated that he has always obeyed the central government and has always expressed sympathy for the cause of resisting Japan and saving the country. However, he does not agree with those who use the name of resisting Japan as a tool for internal strife. His army will never participate in civil wars. Now that the war against Japan has stopped, he is willing to lead his troops to the northwest to reclaim wasteland. Wen and others also went to Xuanhua to meet with Fang Zhenwu.

<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin this afternoon. He told reporters in the car that yesterday the Military Sub-Committee held a meeting to discuss the closing of wartime agencies and the distribution of defense areas for various armies in the future. The Hebei Provincial Government is responsible for receiving the lost territory within the Pass and is making preparations. Excellent members will be drawn from the security forces in Beiping and Tianjin to go there as receiving police to maintain law and order. During the takeover, the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of each county will go to handle it. The losses in the Luoyang area are very large. In the future, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies will be exempted to relieve the people's plight. The actual number of puppet troops under Li Jichun and Zhao Lei in Luoyang is only 3,000. The rumor of 7,000 is not accurate. It is very easy to resolve. Xiong Bin has been in Tianjin negotiating with the Japanese side.

<h3 id="e27">How Can We Curb Real Disasters <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Since many years, our country has been plagued by continuous disasters. The people have nowhere to escape death, hence, the chaos has continued, and there has been no peaceful day so far. Among the provinces and regions, Shaanxi Province has suffered the most from natural disasters for the longest time. Since 1929, Shaanxi Province has been plagued by droughts, and incidents of selling young daughters and digging up tree roots for food have been heard of every day. Recently, it has become more and more serious. Those who travel to Shaanxi Province can see it with their own eyes. In the counties of Guanzhong, most of the people's houses have no doors or windows. Generally, the people have pawned and sold everything and have no ability to continue to maintain them. And land and houses, due to the heavy taxes, no one is willing to accept and buy them. As a result, they are broken up into doors and windows to be sold as firewood to support their temporary lives. Although the relief from various charitable organizations cannot be said to be useless, it is mostly of a philanthropic nature and only benefits the moment, and it is difficult to provide long-term relief. And this kind of relief is not a fundamental way to save disasters. Moreover, it is like adding a cup of water to a cartload of burning firewood and can't stop the continuous expansion of the disaster area. In the spring of this year, Shaanxi Province had several rains, and the wheat seedlings were still good. According to general speculation, it may slightly relieve the current difficulties. But in reality, due to the lack of seeds and the scarcity of labor, the unseeded fields account for almost half of the cultivated land. Even if there is a good harvest this year, it is not certain that it can be restored to its original state in a short period of time. Unexpectedly, in early last month, there was a sudden disaster of strong winds, and the wheat seedlings died, and there is no hope for the spring harvest. In addition, there are various adverse effects in politics, from the local troops' exploitation to the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies. Even in ordinary years, the people will be unbearable, let alone add to it natural disasters? Few of the people of Shaanxi will not turn into ditches and ravines.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, today, the disaster-stricken areas in our country are more than just Shaanxi Province. As far away as Sichuan and Gansu, the people are all starving and cold, and their vitality is cut off. And the various armies in Sichuan still disregard the lives and deaths of the people, only knowing to seize territory. The situation is hopeless. I don't know that after the people are so poor that they can't live, how can the army survive? In other areas such as Jiangyan, Hubei, and southern Henan, the suffering of the people in the "Red Disaster" area is not necessarily less than the disasters in Sichuan and Shaanxi. These are all related to human affairs, not necessarily all natural disasters, and human power cannot save them. Recently, a powerful neighbor has wantonly used troops, and the residents of Jinan and Dongdu had to escape Pingjin under the threat of artillery fire and bombs. Now the order is gradually stable, and the people's hearts are roughly settled, but these victims cannot stay in Pingjin, and how can they escape to the distant wasteland? If they want to return to their hometowns, their houses are ruins and their fields are barren. Their distress and instability are no less than those who have suffered disasters elsewhere. Looking around our China, how many people can live and work in peace? And those who are constantly subjected to the fierce attacks of natural and man-made disasters are still without peace.</p>
<p>However, "Heaven's sins can still be escaped." There is a clear lesson in the ancient training. Looking at the history books, there is no shortage of old examples. However, our country tends to let natural disasters develop naturally whenever they occur. Only the great Yu was able to control the flood completely with the absolute victory of human power. The rest have no power to overcome the changes in human affairs. Therefore, from the Han and Tang dynasties to the Ming and Qing dynasties, most of them took disaster and famine as the cause, and evolved into the chaos of dynastic changes. The rise of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong originated from disasters and famines. The Ming society was therefore not preserved. The so-called era of petty prosperity is actually just a temporary state of sleep after the chaos, not a real way to achieve governance. What we regret most is that our human administration has not fully exerted its inherent political functions to seek the way to governance. Looking at our close neighbors, their aggression against our country, and their people are fleshy to us, is really hateful. But a careful look at the internal human affairs and politics of their country also has things that we can learn from. For example, the Great Kanto Earthquake in September 1923 destroyed 556,000 houses, killed more than 100,000 people, and lost 10 billion wealth, which accounted for more than one-tenth of Japan's total national wealth. But with the efforts of the whole country, the wounds were completely restored in less than ten years. As far away as Germany in Europe, after the World War, the whole country was almost a tomb. Even this astronomical amount of compensation should be hopeless for revival. But also in ten years, all kinds of waste are lifted up, and still standing in the ranks of the six major powers in the world. Our country is indeed in an unprecedented predicament today. Even in terms of natural disasters, its area is wide, and the depth of the disaster is not something that can be recovered in a day or two. If our people do not quickly rise up, eliminate all the roots of "man-made disasters" from the passive side, and engage in all political constructions from the active side, how can we stop the continued invasion of disasters? This is what we are deeply worried about.</p>

<p>June 25th in Tokyo to Proceed</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Russian government proposed to begin negotiations with representatives of the puppet organization on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway on the 29th of this month. The Japanese proposal to mediate all railway disputes between Russia and the puppet regime has been accepted by the Russian government. (4th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Sokolnikov, representing the Soviet Russian government, responded to the Japanese proposal to mediate between Russia and Manchuria to facilitate the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, stating that the Soviet Union accepts Japan's proposal to initiate the negotiations in Tokyo and that the negotiations should begin on June 25th. (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to the publicly released exchange of documents between Japan and Russia, negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway to "Manchukuo" will be held in Tokyo on June 25th. On May 29th, the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Ota, expressed to the Foreign Committee that although the economic importance of the Chinese Eastern Railway has recently decreased sharply, the Japanese government believes that this railway has become a source of conflict between Japan, Manchuria, and Russia. Therefore, from the standpoint of maintaining peace in the Far East, its suitability for resolving this problem fundamentally should be recognized. Therefore, the Japanese government has carefully considered the Soviet government's request to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. Ota continued that the Japanese government has exchanged views with "Manchukuo" on this issue, and "Manchukuo is prepared to purchase this railway under appropriate conditions." The Japanese ambassador then requested the Soviet government to notify "Manchukuo" and ask it to appoint representatives to attend the negotiations, stating that the Japanese government is willing to assist in the negotiations and act as a mediator. He also proposed that the negotiations could be held in Tokyo, while declaring that the "Manchukuo government" is prepared to begin negotiations immediately. On June 3rd, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sokolnikov delivered the Soviet reply to Ota, stating that the Soviet government has received the official report from the Japanese government regarding its willingness to act as a mediator in the Russia-Manchuria negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway and that "Manchukuo" is willing to begin negotiations immediately. The Soviet government accepts the Japanese government's proposal and agrees to appoint representatives to attend the negotiations in Tokyo, and proposes that the negotiations begin on June 25th.

For example, if the lowest selling price of a domestic product is 10 yuan, but a foreign product sells for only 6 yuan, then an anti-dumping duty of 4 yuan should be levied. If a foreign product is not owned by a domestic producer but is being dumped by a foreign merchant, then there is no need to levy a tax. It is heard that the collection procedures will be entrusted to the Customs for convenience, and it is expected to be implemented within this month. (4th, Special Telegram)</p>

<p>National News Agency, 4th, New York. American aviator MacTernan, who is flying around the world alone, departed from Roosevelt Airfield at 5:20 AM yesterday. At 2 PM that afternoon, someone saw his "Century of Progress" plane flying over the island of Huahan near Newfoundland, high and fast, apparently without encountering engine trouble. It is expected that he will reach the vicinity of England early this morning. According to his friends, MacTernan expressed before departure that he intends to return to New York within a week, hoping to break the 1931 record of eight days for circumnavigating the world by Post and Gatty. He is only carrying nine dollars and thirty cents to cover expenses in case of an accident. The food he brought consists only of a set of tea leaves, one gallon of clear water, six oranges, and a package of meat sandwiches, enough for one day. In order to reduce the load, he did not even bring a radio, so that he could carry more gasoline.</p>
<p>Reuters, 4th, London. Marten, who departed from New York yesterday to create a solo record for flying around the world, has now crossed the Atlantic. According to a telephone call from Dublin, Marten's plane has appeared in the sky over County Clare, Ireland. If Mr. Marten's flight is successful, he will be the first teenager to fly around the world. The continuation of the telegram stating Marten's passing over County Clare has not been confirmed as of 3 PM.</p>
<p>National News, 2nd, New York. American aviator MacTernan departed from Roosevelt Airfield here at 5:20 AM this morning, flying solo around the globe. His route is planned to go directly from New York to Berlin for landing, then via Russia to Yakutsk in Siberia, and then across the Pacific Ocean directly to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and from there to Chicago and back to New York. The plane he is flying is the same one he flew with Griffin last year, attempting to circumnavigate the world, which was interrupted in Russia due to fog. It is also the same plane that Post and Gatty used to circumnavigate the world.</p>
<p>National News Agency, 2nd, Moscow. Today, aviation officials here stated that American aviator MacTernan cannot take the route via Yakutsk and must follow the route officially approved by the Soviet authorities, namely from Moscow via Novosibirsk, Verkneudinsk, and Khabarovsk.</p>
<p>National News, 4th, Penden (Ireland). American aviator MacTernan flew over here at 2:50 PM today. The "Century of Progress" plane was flying extremely fast, but its heading seemed to be towards Paris.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Japan's Invasion Expenses Total 400 Million Yen <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Next Year's Budget Shortfall is 800 Million</p>
<p>Military Expenses for the North China Truce Somewhat Eased</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is clear that the Saito Cabinet will compile the budget for the next fiscal year. When the previous parliament passed the budget for this fiscal year, it attached a serious resolution to the Saito Cabinet, demanding that it make efforts to establish a financial plan in the future. It is quite interesting to see how the current cabinet will compile the budget for the next fiscal year. The Manchurian Incident expenses and military equipment improvement expenses for this fiscal year total 400 million yen. However, based on the current situation in Manchuria, there is no possibility of reducing the Manchurian Incident expenses for the next fiscal year, and the military equipment improvement expenses will instead be doubled. In addition, there is hardly any room for reorganizing various established expenses. Therefore, the budget for the next fiscal year will increase compared to the 2.3 billion yen for this fiscal year. As for revenue, due to the gradual revitalization of the financial world, there is some hope for an increase in various consumption taxes and tariffs. The government's tax increase plan seems hopeless. Other tax increase plans include raising tobacco prices and postal fees. Regular annual revenue can be increased by about 50 million to 100 million yen compared to this fiscal year. However, comparing expenditures and revenues, expenditures are approximately 2.3 billion, while regular annual revenue is approximately 1.4 billion, and temporary revenue is 100 million, totaling 1.5 billion yen. After offsetting, there is still a shortfall of 800 million yen. This amount must be sought from public bonds, so a large amount of public bonds will also be issued next year. (4th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As the political situation has stabilized, the Japanese government is focusing on the budget compilation period. The Ministry of Finance has already started preparing under the budget compilation policy. As Finance Minister Takahashi has moved to Hayama, the outline of the compilation policy should be decided within this month. Therefore, the cabinet will generally decide on the following policies in mid-month: Requests for new projects are limited to urgent ones. Each ministry should strive to save established expenses for new projects to replenish financial resources. The Manchurian Incident expenses, military equipment improvement expenses, and expenses for saving the current situation must be discussed separately. There is no difference between this and the budget compilation policy for the 8th year of Showa (1933). However, the difficulty this time is how to prevent the expansion of expenditures caused by the increase in military spending, which is the biggest reason, and how to fill the revenue deficit caused by the issuance of deficit public bonds. The former has been slightly eased due to the stability of the political situation in North China and the healthy development of "Manchukuo," but the replenishment of weapons and materials and the improvement of weapons will increase compared to the 8th year of Showa, so an increase in expenditures is inevitable. As for the latter revenue, it is necessary to find ways to increase it. Therefore, the Tax System Revision Preparation Committee is eager to create a concrete plan. However, the public is worried about the issuance of public bonds, but the government, due to the military's enthusiastic tax increase theory, Finance Minister Takahashi has recently inclined towards the tax increase theory. Therefore, the result will be to increase postage and cigarette prices, and to add sales taxes. (4th, Denstu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy Ministry's budget for the next fiscal year is currently being reviewed by the Bureau of Accounting. Its total amount is approximately 400 million yen, of which the newly requested expenses include ship maintenance fees, aviation fees, land and sea equipment fees, warship defense fees, and various research fees. Another important issue is the Second Replenishment Plan established due to the London Treaty. Navy Minister Osumi stated in the previous parliament that this expense is necessary this year. According to the Navy Ministry's original proposal to the Ministry of Finance, the ships to be built are one defense ship (8,000 tons), two cruisers (8,500 tons), seven destroyers (1,400 tons), one mine-laying ship (5,000 tons), six submarines of various sizes, and several minesweepers and torpedo boats, totaling 370 million yen. The Navy authorities hope to complete them before the 11th year of Showa (1936). (4th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kanto region's large-scale air defense exercise, which will be held in mid-August this year, is unprecedented in Japan. The Tokyo Garrison Command and the authorities of each prefecture have already decided on a concrete plan and are now preparing for it. Tokyo Garrison Commander Lieutenant General Hayashi is the exercise supervisor, the governors of each prefecture are advisors to the supervisor's office, and the police chiefs of each prefecture are members of the supervisor's office. The air defense headquarters is located in the Army Military Academy. Staff officers from the Yokosuka and Tateyama Naval Air Corps, the Army General Staff Headquarters, the Garrison Command, the Aviation Headquarters, and the Field Heavy Artillery School, and other relevant authorities for each exercise, held a final meeting the other day to discuss the methods for carrying out various air defense tasks. The attacking military planes are 30 planes launched from a naval aircraft carrier to attack the capital. The defending military planes are 50 planes from the army, and more than 30 anti-aircraft guns, sound locators, searchlights, etc. will also participate. When the attacking military planes arrive in Tokyo, the entire city will be blacked out. (Japan United Communications)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Japan Does Not Abandon Its Policy of Aggression, Opposes the Arms Reduction Convention and Security Guarantees <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The executive committee of the Geneva Arms Reduction Conference will discuss the proposal of British Prime Minister MacDonald. The Japanese government has issued a comprehensive instruction to its plenipotentiary, Sato, regarding the British proposal. This afternoon, it was strictly ordered that all clauses in the first part of the MacDonald proposal, which guarantees security, must not be agreed to under any circumstances. It was also ordered to state Japan's attitude at the executive committee meeting. The reasons are as follows: The first part of the MacDonald proposal stipulates that whether or not there has been a violation of the Non-Aggression Treaty will be decided by the contracting parties of the five powers after consultation. In order for it to take effect, it will be decided according to the Seven-Power Consultation Treaty of the UK, US, France, Italy, Japan, and Russia. However, it is difficult for Japan to participate, as its spirit is the same as withdrawing from the League of Nations. The third article of the first part stipulates that whether or not there is a threat to violate the Non-Aggression Treaty will be decided by a five-power conference. All procedures for the contracting parties to hold a meeting are determined by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and the meeting place is decided in principle in Geneva, which are all difficult for the Japanese government to accept. The Japanese government limits the intervention of third countries or the League of Nations in the political problems of the Far East. Therefore, it has broken ties with the League of Nations. Therefore, there is no room for reservation or amendment to the first part. Therefore, it will strictly adhere to the established policy of maintaining a free position outside of the agreement items for applying the first part. (4th, Denstu News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs carefully studied foreign policy. Recently, a plan has been formed, and the necessary expenses will be requested when the government compiles the budget for the next fiscal year to concretize and regenerate foreign policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently conducting informal negotiations with the Ministry of Finance. It is heard that the diplomatic expenses will be used as follows: 1. The Empire's diplomatic plan after withdrawing from the League aims to expand and strengthen its national economic diplomacy. 2. For this purpose, consulates in places such as continental Europe where economic relations with Japan are not very close will be abolished or reduced, while the diplomatic organs in important markets for Japanese goods such as Egypt, South Africa, India, Southeast Asia, China, "Manchukuo," and the Americas will be expanded. 3. The trade relations between Japan and India are serious, and special measures should be considered. Currently, there are only the Consul-General in Calcutta and the Consul in Bombay in India. Next year, consulates should be established in Karachi and Madras, and an ambassador-level figure should be appointed as the Consul-General in Calcutta to negotiate all issues with the Indian government.

According to the morning newspaper, it will be held on June 7th. On the other hand, the French ambassadors stationed in Rome and London have been ordered to continue negotiations.

<p>(Berlin) The discord between France and Italy regarding the Four-Power Pact seems to be more serious than expected. According to sources here, France has suddenly raised new objections to various points that the other three countries considered to have been resolved practically. Although official circles are maintaining strict secrecy, it is expected that France's new reservations involve the issue of German equality and the wording of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, which is to impose sanctions on aggressor countries. German political circles now expect Italy and England to be unwilling to make further concessions to France, and the agreement may not be signed until next week. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e64">US Senate Passes Bill to Abolish Gold Standard <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-Six Countries Have Already Devalued Their Currencies</p>
<p>National News Agency, 3rd, Washington. Today, Republican Senator Borah led the gold standard supporters to a great victory in the Senate with the most vehement speech of his life. By a large majority of 48 votes to 20, the bill to abolish the gold standard was passed, causing only 20 Republicans, who have always been known for supporting the gold standard, to maintain their original position. The remaining 16 joined the Democrats' inflationary faction and voted to defeat the gold standard. Even with the best efforts of Virginia Senator Glass and Pennsylvania Senator Reed to defend the gold standard, they could only lament the inevitable trend of the times. The bill is now being sent to the White House, where the President is expected to sign and promulgate it immediately. From then on, all currencies in the United States will become "legal tender" and can be used to pay customs duties and other debts to the government, and the government can also use them to repay the principal and interest on public bonds. In legal terms, it is no longer necessary to have gold coins and gold certificates. After the bill was introduced to the Senate today, the opposition (i.e., the gold standard supporters) tried their best to amend it, limiting its application to future gold coin debts, arguing that Congress had no right to destroy obligations that had already been established. This amendment was also rejected by the majority because if it had been adopted, the government would still have had to use gold coins to redeem existing public bonds. Borah's most important point in the debate was that since 36 countries have already devalued their currencies, the gold standard cannot be maintained. These countries initially struggled to maintain it, but were ultimately forced by the trend of the times to abandon the gold standard.</p>
<h3 id="e65">American Speculative Fever <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Differing Opinions from Various Parties</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 3rd – The American public’s sudden return to the securities market and the increasing fervor of speculation is causing considerable concern to the government. There are widespread rumors that the President is considering a plan to curb the speculative fever, but inquiries at the White House have failed to confirm this. It is also reported that government advisors have warned the authorities that if a speculative wave does occur at this time, it will render much of the work of raising prices futile. However, according to news from New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, brokers and merchants are not paying much attention to this matter. New York financiers do not believe that the rise in the securities market will have a detrimental impact on business, and merchants are conducting business as usual. Most believe that the government cannot legally prevent the public from buying and selling securities, and they say that the recent rise in the securities market is not entirely the result of speculation, but largely due to rising prices. Furthermore, there is one thing that can ease the concerns of those in power: there is currently no movement to organize new companies, and no large-scale speculative securities have appeared on the exchanges.</p>

<p>Hopes for Improvement from the London Conference</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 3rd – The President of the German National Bank, Schacht, departed for Basel this evening to attend the meeting of the Bank for International Settlements convened on Sunday and Monday. After Schacht returns to Berlin from Basel, the German government will consider the issue of debt payments and the policies to be adopted. According to the Angriffe, the organ of the National Socialist Party, the current state of the debt payment issue is roughly as follows: "Due to the significant shortage of cash and foreign currency in the German National Bank, and the fact that restrictions on export trade have not been removed, the representatives of various countries at the payment conference agree that suspending payments is the only way out at present. Therefore, Germany's hopes for the World Economic Conference are twofold: first, that the various restrictions on German export business can be lifted as soon as possible; second, that a solution to the private debt problem can be found. If the London Conference can resolve these two issues soon, not only can Germany engage in economic construction, but it can also resume foreign debt payments. This is indeed the key to the common interests of all countries in the world."</p>

<h3 id="e69">Eastern European Alliance Conference <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Romanian Capital, 4th – The conference of agricultural countries in Eastern and Central Europe opened today. The eight countries that decided to establish the "Eastern European Alliance" in 1930, namely Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, have all sent representatives to participate. In addition, representatives from Greece and Turkey are attending the meeting as observers. The discussions at the meeting will focus on establishing a common program for agricultural countries in Eastern and Central Europe to be presented at the London Economic Conference. The main point of this program is the difficult situation of agricultural product exports caused by the worldwide overproduction of agricultural products. This program represents 100 million people, most of whom are engaged in agriculture. The conference will address the issue of providing long-term loans to agricultural countries. The agricultural countries plan to point out to creditor countries at the economic conference that it would also be beneficial to creditor countries if agricultural debtor countries were allowed to repay debts with agricultural products, as creditor countries would then organize markets to absorb the exports of debtor countries. Finally, the agricultural countries' conference will discuss the results of the preferential tariff rates agreed upon at last year's Dresden Conference, recognizing the need to protect them.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 3rd – Today's Neue Wiener Journal reported that after Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss returns to Austria from Rome in the near future, he will issue an order banning the National Socialist Party. This news has not been reported by other newspapers, and the government has not confirmed it. According to the newspaper, the government's move is necessary to protect the country's economic life and foreign tourists visiting Austria. Therefore, the recruitment of members by the National Socialist Party, all gatherings and speeches of the National Socialist Party, wearing of National Socialist Party uniforms, wearing of badges, and publication of newspapers, magazines, and propaganda materials will all be prohibited.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 3rd – Key figures of the National Socialist Party held a secret meeting.

<p>Religious Courses Banned in Schools</p>
<p>Clergy Prohibited from Entering Universities</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 3rd – The Pope issued a notice today, strongly condemning the separation of church and state law in Spain and the church act that the Spanish president has now approved. This church act stipulates the confiscation of church property and prohibits Catholic clergy from teaching. The Pope urged Spanish Catholics to use their ability to promote the teaching of religious studies and to unite to defend their faith, but the notice implied that the church could cooperate with the government. The Pope did not order Catholics to overthrow the new government, saying that the church could recognize any political system, but freedom of belief must be completely unimpaired.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 3rd – Today, President Zamora approved the recent Spanish parliamentary decree banning religious courses in schools. This move was unexpected by the church authorities, so church leaders everywhere have risen up in opposition, declaring that anyone who harms the church should receive appropriate punishment. It is feared that this will cause political and religious disputes in Spain, but it is generally believed that the church will not excommunicate the president. According to the new law passed by the parliament, all elementary schools established by various churches should be closed by October 1 of this year, and secondary schools established by churches should be closed by June 1 of next year. All clergy, monks, and nuns are not allowed to attend universities.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 3rd – The Spanish government's religious bill stipulates that Catholic priests are not allowed to carry out other educational activities except for theology. More than 4,000 monasteries and other religious institutions must now pay taxes, which they were previously exempt from. Church personnel recently protested, stating that the bill destroys the divine authority of the church, restricts the freedom of the church, oppresses the apostles, and is hostile to the church's cultural work.</p>
<p>Havas, Madrid, 4th – More than 40 Catholic writers signed and published a declaration last night protesting the government's promulgated laws on the church system.</p>

<p>TASS, London, 3rd – Today, the Daily Herald published a detailed chart illustrating that Anglo-Russian trade has suffered a fatal blow since the British government's explicit boycott of Russian goods. The total value of orders placed by the Soviet Union in Britain reached £3,670,000 in the first five months of 1932, while in the same period this year it was only £700,000. In April 1932, the value of Soviet orders in Britain was £1,177,000, and in May it was £1,442,000, but in April this year, the total value of orders reached only £314,000, and in May, the Soviet Union placed no orders with Britain. The leasing of ships also shows the same decline. In April 1932, Soviet companies leased four ships, paying £189,000 in rent to British steamship companies, while last month, Soviet companies did not lease a single ship from Britain.</p>

The Emperor stood in the palace, looking down at the Prince leading the troops past. The weather was clear today, and there were more spectators than in previous years. Seeing the Emperor standing on the balcony, cheers erupted. The Emperor removed his hat, bowed, and waved to show his gratitude.</p>

<p>Mine Owners and Foremen Exploiting and Abusing</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Chinese Laborers Displaced</p>
<p>(Reuters, Singapore Correspondence, 30th) Song Faxiang, the Chinese Consul-General in Java, returned from an inspection of West Borneo and vehemently condemned the cruel methods used by the mine owners and foremen of the Billiton Island and West Borneo tin mines to treat Chinese laborers. According to his statement, none of the Chinese laborers employed in the Billiton Island and West Borneo tin mines will be able to accumulate a small fortune or return to their homeland after their contracts expire under the current circumstances. This is because there is a major payment day every six months, when workers can withdraw all the wages they have saved with the owners, but most of them have already spent all their wages on daily expenses. Pre-paid expenses require interest of nine cents for every two and a half guilders. On the major payment day, the owner supervises the deduction of all pre-paid expenses and interest from China and Japan. Moreover, that day is also a Fantan day, and there are various forms of gambling, so the workers' remaining funds are often spent here. The factory owners exploit the workers with cunning plans. They set up stores that sell various dry foods and other items to the workers at extremely high prices. The workers only seek temporary convenience and do not care about the high prices. Over time, their debts accumulate and must be paid off in full on the major payment day. What is even more painful is that these stores also sell opium, so that the funds earned by the workers' blood and sweat are either spent on gambling or lost to drugs. It has been found that the tin mines and tobacco plantations in the two places employ tens of thousands of Chinese laborers. According to the contract, they receive wages of seven and a half guilders per day and must work at least 360 days to complete a one-year contract. Before the contract expires, they are not allowed to engage in other occupations. On average, workers need one and a half years to complete their contract, and the weaker ones need two or three years, because they are often plagued by illness and cannot work. After the first year of the contract expires, both parties can freely renew it for another year. The second-term wages are higher, between 15 and 30 guilders per month, but the foremen exhaust all means to make the workers pre-spend a large portion of their wages before the second contract expires, so that they cannot remit money back home or leave their jobs. It is said that among those who complete their first contract, less than one in a hundred is able to settle their debts with the owner before their death. Mr. Song is now doing his best to improve the situation of these unfortunate workers, and the Nanjing diplomatic government is handling the negotiations.</p>

<p>To all newspaper offices in Guangzhou, The communist bandits in Jiangxi are being suppressed, but foreign troubles are taking advantage of the situation. The fate of the nation is hanging by a thread, and there is no time to delay. This is truly a time of national crisis. Jitang, holding a military rank, bears a heavy responsibility and fears that the Republic of China, which was built with great difficulty, will be destroyed, and that the noble Chinese nation will be reduced to servitude. I am restless day and night, unable to sleep or eat. Since the bandits have spread throughout the four borders, I have reluctantly deployed elite troops, led by General Yu Hanmou, to enter Jiangxi, all to eliminate the bandits and harm the people for the sake of the country. Since starting until now, it has been more than a year, and there have been hundreds of battles, large and small. Among them, the Battle of Chijiang Shuikou inflicted the heaviest damage on the bandit army. It is a pity that the Guangdong defense must also be taken into account, and it was not possible to increase the number of troops to pursue the victory, so the bandits were able to survive and continue their poisoning. Now, the people of Jiangxi who are trapped in the bandit dens cannot even seek death, and those who are fortunate enough to be outside the bandit area are also suffering from traffic congestion and food shortages, either committing suicide by jumping into the river or hanging themselves, or making cakes from soil to fill their hunger. The tragic state of displacement and death cannot be described in words. Alas, my people are suffering from this great disaster. Who is to blame? I cannot but hate the extremely vicious red bandits who are willing to be tigers. Now that the pacification work in Guangdong Province is gradually being completed, seeing the rampant bandits in Jiangxi and hearing the urgent border situation, I am doubly concerned in this difficult time. In addition to dispatching elite troops to the north to resist foreign aggression, I am planning to send additional troops to drive straight into Jiangxi and join forces with the other armies to encircle and suppress the bandits. Jitang has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route of the Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei Bandit Suppression Army, and should do his best to eliminate the bandits and thugs, fight for the survival of the Party and the country, and seek a way out for the nation. As long as there is a breath left, I will not hesitate to turn back. Alas, Li and Zhang caused chaos in the Central Plains, and the Manchus took the opportunity to invade. The past is not far away, and the lessons are there. In the vast thousands of years, I think of the great difficulties of the future. In the vast China, I see the limited sunset. Without waving Lu Yang's spear, it is difficult to resolve the crisis of Huang Chao. I hope that the advanced members of the Party and the country, and the comrades in the army, will feel the danger of being in the same boat in the wind and rain, and strive to lie on firewood and taste gall, uniting our hearts and minds to overcome the difficulties together, so that we can eliminate the red disaster and resist foreign aggression. The future of the nation depends on this. I respectfully submit this telegram and await your instructions. Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route of the Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei Bandit Suppression Army, bows his head.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Xu Bandits Re-occupy Nanjiang Amidst Sichuan War <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Tian Songyao and Liu Cunhou's Troops Both Suffer Losses</p>
<p>Liu and Deng Have Not Stopped Fighting, Sichuan Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Sichuan, anciently known as the Land of Abundance, has remarkable mountains and rivers, and abundant products. The Red Bandits have wanted to seize it for more than a day. Last December, Xu Xiangqian's bandit troops fled from Hubei to Shaanxi, approaching Hanzhong. General speculation was that they would flee towards Gansu. At that time, the garrison in Nanzheng was weak, and the defense of Gansu was even more empty. If they launched a fierce attack on Nanzheng, crossed the Han River, and crossed the Jialing River, it would not be difficult to drive straight in and achieve their wish. However, after reaching Nanzheng, they fled south. Before long, Tongjiang fell, and Nanjiang and Bazhong were also captured by them. Then it was known that the bandit's purpose was here and not there. After entering Sichuan, the bandits regarded it as a new base and spared no effort in its management. Northern Sichuan was originally barren, and the people had long suffered from harsh government. After being instigated by the bandits, many people joined them. Within a few months, pseudo county, town, district, and township Soviet governments were organized, and the bandit's strength increased from several thousand to tens of thousands. Chiang Kai-shek believed that the bandit's entry into Sichuan was a hidden danger and appointed Tian Songyao as the Bandit Suppression Supervisor of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Area, responsible for blocking and suppressing them. He also ordered Yang Hucheng, the Pacification Director stationed in Shaanxi, to send troops to pursue them. At this time, the Sichuan war had come to an end, and Tian dispatched five divisions of his six divisions to meet the enemy. Tian himself also went to Hanzhong to command. Liu Cunhou, the Border Defense Supervisor of Sichuan and Shaanxi, also sent heavy troops to assist. After several battles, the bandits were defeated, but they never intended to leave Sichuan. Recently, Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou's cliques became enemies, and war was imminent. Because the bandits had not left the border, they did not dare to launch an attack. Xu Bandits, in order to promote the Sichuan war, immediately abandoned Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong, and retreated into Shaanxi. Thus, the victory telegrams of bandit suppression came like snowflakes, but they did not know that they had fallen into their trap. After the rupture between Liu and Deng, three divisions of Tian's troops were sent to Deyang, Shifang, Pengxian, and Huaizhou to concentrate and participate in the war. Most of the garrison troops in northern Sichuan were old, weak, and incompetent. Xu Bandits, knowing that northern Sichuan was empty, immediately made a comeback. At the end of last month, they reached Kushu Dam in Tongjiang, defeating Tian's troops. Liu Cunhou's reinforcements were also defeated and could only hold on to the dangerous terrain. The bandits then attacked Nanjiang with large forces. It is reported that the county seat of Nanjiang was re-occupied on the 30th, and there is a tendency to disrupt Tongjiang, Wanyuan, and Bazhong on a large scale. Tian and Liu's troops have both suffered losses and seem to have no resistance. If reinforcements are not sent to counterattack, the counties in northern Sichuan may all be occupied by Xu Bandits. At this critical moment, the war between Liu and Deng has not stopped. On the 2nd, Liu's troops, led by Leng Yindong's division and Li, Song, Liu, Zhao, and Huang's brigades, launched a third general attack on Deng's army in Chongning and Sandao Yan. Huaizhou also launched an attack at the same time. The goal is still to cross the Kun River and capture Pengguan and other counties. It is also reported that the river embankment opposite Jinzhu Weir has been destroyed by landmines, and the farmland in the fourteen counties of western Sichuan has been flooded. The Sichuan warlords are harming the country and the people to such an extent that they are truly guilty and unforgivable. (3rd)</p>

<p>(Truth) What exactly is it that needs to be proven conclusively? In the natural sciences, it is easier to prove with more concrete facts. In the humanities and social systems, it is very difficult to determine. Even when the natural sciences have not fully convinced their opponents, there are still many examples of persecution. For example, the heliocentric theory is now a theory that no one will deny, but in the 17th century, Galileo's heliocentric theory offended the Bible and angered the French Emperor, and he was forced to swear in Rome that he would no longer write books advocating "geocentrism." Even in his old age, he could not avoid being imprisoned. Similarly, evolution is now almost considered an indelible truth, but at that time, even professors at British universities were expelled from their schools. The states of Tennessee and others in the American South even banned the study of evolution in public schools, facts that were ridiculed by the world's cultural circles. Thinking of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of our motherland, who wanted to unify the world and prepare a foundation for his sons and grandsons to rule for ten thousand generations, he implemented an extremely foolish policy, even resorting to "burning books and burying scholars" to maintain the unified world.</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power in Germany, there has been one more fascist state. In order to stabilize its regime, it has not hesitated to imitate Qin Shi Huang, not only listing all writings with red and revolutionary meanings as against the national will and spirit, but also having the Brownshirts search everywhere, burn these books, and drive away all left-wing scholars. This is the case in the West, and of course, things cannot be too monotonous in the East. Japan has been the most sincere and similar country to Germany for decades, especially in learning from Germany militarily, which is a well-known story.</p>
<p>Although Japan has not suffered the serious post-war blows like Germany, burdened with reparations and bound by the Treaty of Versailles, it is making every effort to create a so-called national crisis, wanting to use force to open up economic avenues amidst the global panic. Therefore, it forcibly created the September 18th Incident, using military action to stimulate the military supplies industry, and ostensibly supporting the production index in a superficial balance. Moreover, because of the strict police and the unified action of the military and the press, almost no one outside Japan fully knows its true nature. The general public in Japan is also poisoned by "nationalism." Even those who are not poisoned dare not speak out. On the one hand, there is police surveillance, and on the other hand, there is the brute force of the rural veterans' associations. People who speak the "truth" have no opportunity to speak, and their writings are also difficult to make public. Culture will regress.</p>
<p>However, research within Japan is still relatively free. The Imperial University Library and other libraries still hold many banned books. There are still many professors at various universities who are searching for "truth." These people who are searching for truth, especially those who are searching for truth in the social sciences, are thorns in the side of the military authorities and are rebels against the current Japanese society. Kyoto Imperial University produced Kawakami Hajime, which was already earth-shattering, but in the general intellectual world, he has the authority of "truth" and wins the trust and admiration of the majority. Now there is the Takigawa Yukitoki professor incident. Professor Takigawa wrote a "Textbook on Criminal Law" a year ago. This book was originally not a very serious "traitorous" work. It merely criticized the shortcomings of Japan's current criminal law from a Marxist standpoint. Therefore, he was charged with offending the authorities and will be dismissed. The Ministry of Education explained Professor Takigawa's crimes as follows:</p>
<p>"First, regarding Professor Takigawa's writings on criminal law, his fundamental thought is Marxist thought, and he also admits that changes in the structure of the social economy are necessary. Second, regarding the crime of insurrection described in the 'Textbook on Criminal Law' (he admits that it is a revolution), it is harmful to the good customs of Japan. Third, Professor Takigawa's various writings, such as 'Textbook on Criminal Law' and 'Lectures on Criminal Law,' etc., are all harmful to security and destroy the purity and beauty of customs, thus violating the 'principle of cultivating students' personality and fostering national thought.' Therefore, the Ministry of Education advocated suspending Professor Takigawa to rectify the academic atmosphere."</p>
<p>However, the school, from the students to the president of the university, did not agree with the Ministry of Education's proposition. First, they argued that universities have academic freedom, and this freedom is conferred by law. Second, Professor Takigawa's writings have not in the slightest degree destroyed national thought or damaged the cultivation of students' personalities. On the contrary, they have precisely perfected this thought and cultivated students' loyal beliefs. Third, the Ministry of Education disregarded the autonomy of Kyoto Imperial University and overstepped its authority in dismissing Professor Takigawa's teaching position. Therefore, thirty-nine scholars, including all the professors, assistant professors, lecturers, and assistants of the Kyoto University Faculty of Law, jointly submitted their resignations, and President Konishi also submitted his resignation. At the same time, more than 1,600 students of the Faculty of Law united firmly to uphold "truth" and academic freedom and to resist the illegal oppression of the authorities. Not only the various faculties of Kyoto University showed sympathy and consistent support for the Faculty of Law, but other imperial universities were also brewing movements to sympathize with Kyoto University and oppose the Ministry of Education. Kyoto University graduates in cities such as Osaka and Tokyo are preparing for movements to uphold "academic freedom" and resist "government violence." Japanese schools have never had much unrest. This student unrest has very significant ideological implications and serious political implications. But let's see how this unrest unfolds. (May 30, 1933, in Osaka)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Developments in the Northern Situation: The Southwestern Anti-Japanese Bandit Extermination Army Temporarily Halts Its Advance <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army's Advance Contingent Temporarily Stays in Chenzhou</p>
<p>The Fourth Independent Division of Guangdong Sends Two Regiments to Pingshi and Lechang</p>
<p>Two Regiments of the Guangxi Army, Long and Ling, Are Transferred to Wuzhou for Training</p>
<p>The Southwestern Political Council Adds Military Ranks for Chen, Bai, and Cai</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Anti-Japanese Advance Contingent of the 19th Route Army, after leaving Guangdong Province and entering southern Hunan, has now reached Chenzhou and is temporarily resting. According to a telegram from the front yesterday, the First and Second Columns and the Headquarters of our army's advance contingent arrived in Chenzhou on the morning of the 25th. The weather was overcast and mild that day. They marched along the main road, and arrived in the afternoon. Thousands of male and female students from various schools in Chenzhou, representatives from various organizations, and people from all walks of life lined the suburbs to welcome them, with firecrackers and cheers, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Commanders Zhang and Tan of the two columns arrived at the camping tents amidst the cheers. Furthermore, the Youth Service Corps, which accompanied the First Column northward, arrived in Chenzhou by car on the 25th and immediately started their propaganda work, which was quite effective in arousing the people. During this Corps's departure with the army, many people along the way requested to join the Corps's work, showing that the patriotic spirit of Chinese youth is not inferior to others. It is learned that after the two columns arrived in Chenzhou, they were ordered to rest temporarily in Chenzhou, and will await further orders before deciding whether to advance or halt. As for the Fourth Independent Division of Guangdong Province, after the First and Second Regiments were dispatched to Shaoguan, the First Regiment, led by Pan Biao, closely followed the tail of the 19th Route Army's advance contingent and has already arrived in Pingshi, while the Second Regiment, led by Zhang Haodong, has also been dispatched to Lechang. The Division Headquarters and the Third Regiment have not yet departed due to unfinished tasks. Furthermore, the 24th Division of the Anti-Japanese Army in Guangxi, led by Qin Lianfang, which was rumored to be transferred, had previously prepared to hire civilian boats to go east, but has not yet set off due to certain matters. According to a Wuzhou dispatch on the 24th, the 132nd Regiment of the 44th Division, led by Long Zhenyi, originally stationed in Pingnan County, has now been transferred to Wuzhou and Rongxu area for garrison. The vacated defense area is filled by teams dispatched from the 43rd Regiment, led by Liang Jin, originally stationed in Guiping and Yulin. The 133rd Regiment of the 45th Division, led by Ling Yaxi, originally stationed in Xixiangtang, Nanning, has also been transferred to Wuzhou for training. One battalion of Liang Jin's regiment in Guiping has been transferred to defend Rong County, and one battalion has been stationed in Pingnan, Teng County, Bahuo Xu, and other places. Recently, there has been a new development in the northern situation, so all armies have temporarily halted in the places they have reached. Unless there are major changes in the future, there seems to be no need for a hasty advance. The Southwestern Political Council, considering that Chen Jitang is determined to actively prepare to assume the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route of the Five Provinces Bandit Extermination, has used the name of the Council to grant Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, and Cai Tingkai military ranks. The order states: "In order to comply with the order, it is hereby noted that anti-Japanese and bandit suppression is the greatest proposition of this Council. In recent years, communist bandits have spread to the provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei, and their poisonous flames have engulfed villages and markets. The armies of various provinces have repeatedly launched painful suppressions along different routes, but have not yet completely eradicated them. Now, although the country is in a time of difficulty, how can we resist foreign aggression and save the country from danger if we do not eliminate the scourge of communist bandits? It has been resolved by this Council to specially appoint Chen Jitang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route of the Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei Bandit Extermination Army, Bai Chongxi as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route of the Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei Bandit Extermination Army, and Cai Tingkai as the Chief Commander of the Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian Army Bandit Extermination Southern Route Forward. In addition to the separate orders, the appointment order is hereby issued. You are hereby ordered to lead the troops, inspire their morale, cooperate and conspire, and immediately launch an extermination campaign to eradicate the bandits at their roots, remove the blemishes, and fulfill the ultimate intention of this Council. We have high hopes." This order, (May 28th).</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Course of the Ceasefire Agreement: Tan Ya <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the situation in the North has ended with a ceasefire, which is fortunate to have brought temporary peace. In reality, the opportunity for peace or danger hangs by a thread, and the key lies in the efforts made in one short hour at 22:00, which led to the mediation. Now that the Tanggu Agreement has been reached, North China can be supported for the time being. All the previous difficulties and obstacles have become history. Yesterday, a gentleman described the course of this matter in great detail, which is specially recorded below, perhaps it is also what the people of the country would like to hear.</p>
<p>The decision to have a partial ceasefire with Japan was made a month ago. At that time, the authorities realized that it would be difficult to win the war and that it would be futile to sacrifice lives, while those out of office also advocated taking a short respite and then planning to recover. After discussions among several people, a principle was decided. It was believed that some people in Japan also felt that it was impossible to annex North China through a long-term war, and that maintaining the puppet organization only needed the Great Wall line as sufficient, and the war could come to an end for a while. Under these two circumstances, some people began to run around in the name of private individuals. However, the army invading China belongs to the Kwantung Army, and although its overall policy towards foreign countries is consistent with that of Japan, there are also divisions within. Roughly speaking, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the military, and the Kwantung Army are three factions. As for the people who ran around on the other side, they were initially only from the foreign affairs department, belonging to the stream of intelligence propaganda. When they came, they were six parts propaganda and four parts sincerity, but their actual strength was only one part. They ran around north and south, scattering business cards, and both the government and the public saw them as private individuals. Seeing that China had many concerns, they said that the Japanese national character was able to yield and also to release, which was a legacy of the Yamato spirit, and that if they once released, there would be no complications. They also occasionally used the theory of race to advance their cause, and the intention of their propaganda was revealed in their words, and everyone knew it. Later, when Huang Fu came north, he first received the scope given by the government on this matter, and assisted the military in determining the standard for a ceasefire. The so-called scope meant that it could not involve politics or diplomacy, and that it must be purely a partial military agreement. If it was within the scope, he would handle it himself to protect Tianjin and Beijing; if it exceeded the scope, there would be no room for negotiation. When he went north, the bombing incident occurred at Tianjin Station, which we speculate was done by reactionaries. This is because the reactionaries believe that if there is a war in North China, the larger ones can attempt to establish a second puppet organization, and the smaller ones can organize plainclothes teams and disrupt the area. If a ceasefire is reached, these people will lose their basis, so they will spare no effort to sabotage it in order to achieve their conspiracy. After Huang Fu came, he first consulted with He Yingqin of the Military Council, showed him the government's policy and limitations, and assisted in the process. As a result, the sound of a ceasefire became louder day by day, and Tianjin and Beijing were in danger. The people were moving and migrating, and when they heard this, they were slightly more stable. However, the contact between the two sides could not be achieved quickly due to the route. Moreover, the extreme circuity and twists and turns, and the twists and turns of the situation, could not be resolved until 22:00 in the evening. The embassy also contacted various parties, but the Japanese soldiers on the east road had reached Lutai on the north road and had fallen into Miyun, and had seized Tongzhou. The air force had come in large numbers, and Tongping was less than forty miles apart. Moreover, the power plant, water supply, and electricity of the Beijing trams were all in Tongzhou. If there was a problem, the impact would increase, and people would become more disturbed. However, by the afternoon of the 22nd, the Tongzhou County Government and the Public Security Bureau had withdrawn, and the military was conscripting people everywhere to carry out defense work. Fearing the riots of plainclothes teams in the city, sandbags were placed along the way, and soldiers were sent to protect the Forbidden City. The chaotic situation can already be seen. Furthermore, on the morning of that day, it was widely rumored at the gate of the Japanese Embassy that Zhao Jingshi had stabbed a Japanese policeman with a knife. As a result, the Japanese side claimed that they were discussing a ceasefire, but now there were complications, which obviously showed that the Chinese people were not sincere, and the topic was getting further and further away. Therefore, the people in charge of the contact saw that the whole effort was about to be destroyed and disaster was imminent, so they spared no effort to facilitate it. Regarding the stabbing of the Japanese soldier, they said that the embassy area was not our responsibility, and that the Japanese residents in the East City were safe and sound, which could serve as evidence. Finally, late on the 22nd, our side happened to get a statement from the government, and the two sides met and spoke briefly and directly. First, they spoke of a ceasefire, because the situation was so urgent at this time that everything else could not be discussed. The main points of the verbal agreement were: (1) We will send people to Miyun to discuss specific measures, (2) They will send people to Beijing, (3) A ceasefire will be implemented immediately, and (4) A place will be determined to formally discuss the matter. After this agreement was reached, the Japanese soldiers accepted the order and did not advance. However, the next day, they continued to shell, so stopping the attack and stopping the advance were two different things. The Japanese first issued an order to stop the advance, so there was still a coda. At that time, our soldiers had already begun to retreat, and the military immediately sent Xu Zuyi to Miyun to discuss the specific details. Once the details were clear, the Japanese soldiers withdrew. At this time, our Tong County began to be taken over by the military, and the situation in Tangshan and Lutai was relatively relaxed. The plainclothes teams, because the Sino-Japanese war was about to cease, and they would have nothing to do, launched riots for days, but ultimately achieved nothing. After Xu returned, the Japanese also sent people, and the decision to hold a meeting in Tanggu on the 29th was made. As for our principles, they had also been told to the other side, that if they were sincere in wanting a ceasefire, then anything outside our scope would have no results if raised. At that time, the Kwantung Army also knew that if they wanted to talk about a ceasefire, they could not force others to do what they could not do, so they were able to mutually understand each other's intentions in advance. On the 29th, our military officially sent people in a special train to Tanggu, and a group from the Kwantung Army also arrived on a warship at the agreed time. However, because they had contacted each other beforehand, all the wording was carefully considered to avoid involving other matters, so no complications arose temporarily. The next day, an agreement was reached and signed, and our representatives returned to Beijing that evening to receive the comfort of the Military Council the next day. Now that the terms of the ceasefire have been set, North China can be temporarily secured. However, the issues of maintaining order in the contested area and the mixed forces of the puppet state cannot be resolved overnight. There are still many things that need to be properly handled after this ceasefire. Our government has repeatedly stated that it has nothing to do with politics or diplomacy, but our nation cannot forget to recover. If we only seek temporary peace and become complacent, then the past of the Southern Song Dynasty will inevitably lead to defeat and destruction. A certain gentleman said, Confucius said that the people are spared but have no shame. Now that we are spared, what about the shamelessness? Although this is a joke, it has great truth and is enough to be a head-on blow for our Chinese people. After the ceasefire agreement was announced in the newspapers on June 1, the people of the north were greatly relieved. As a result, the state of military affairs is gradually disappearing, and the Political Committee is actively preparing, which can also be gradually achieved. From early establishment, only the rest of the broken North China, especially the counties in Hebei that were affected by the war, suffered huge losses. The reorganization of political affairs, once it begins, the handling of its busy and difficult tasks is no less than military affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e82">General Mobilization for Bandit Extermination in Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui Provinces <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>New Plans Decided at the Second He-He Meeting in Changsha</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Arrives in Hankou to Take Office and Then Goes to Huangchuan</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the attention of the Chinese people has focused on the issue of bandit suppression. The so-called "to resist foreign aggression, we must first pacify the interior" has become a unanimous slogan of the government and the public. At present, the areas where the bandit forces are most rampant are Jiangxi Province, followed by Hubei. The borders of Hubei, Henan, and Hubei are the main forces of the Red Bandits. In addition to supervising the suppression in Jiangxi, Chairman Chiang has tasked Xu Yuanquan with eliminating the He bandits, He Jian with eliminating the Kong bandits, Liu Zhenhua with eliminating the Kuang bandits, and He Chengjun with sitting in Hankou and taking care of all parties. He was entrusted with this important task, so he went to Shashi on the 29th of last month to meet Xu Yuanquan, went to Hunan on the 31st to meet He Jian, and returned to Hankou on the 2nd of this month to meet Liu Zhenhua. There have been the latest decisions on the bandit suppression plans of all parties. Now Xu and He (Jian) have all taken up their new positions, and Liu has also arrived in Hankou. The armies of all routes will simultaneously issue a general suppression order within days. The meetings of the past few days and the talks between He and Liu are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>(Changsha Meeting) The Chief of the Hubei Pacification Headquarters, He Chengjun, was ordered by Chairman Chiang to go to Hunan on the 31st of last month to swear in He Jian as the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route of the Five Provinces Bandit Suppression Army, and to consult with Commander-in-Chief He on bandit suppression military affairs. He Jian's special train arrived in Changsha at 8:00 am on the 1st and participated in He's inauguration ceremony at 10:00 am. He then discussed with He Jian and generals Liu Jianxu, Li Jue, Wang Dongyuan, Chen Guangzhong, Tao Guang, Peng Weiren, and Liu Yinggu about the progress of the bandit suppression on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The principles decided by the two He's in Hankou in mid-April were followed, and slight changes were made in light of recent trends. He also reported the details of the Shashi meeting and asked Liu Jianxu to relay to his subordinates and to Xu Yuanquan's army to take contact and make an agreement on suppressing, so that the He bandits could not take care of both ends. It turned out that a part of Liu's army was also under the command of Xu Yuanquan, and He's earnestness in this matter was to achieve the effect of a pincer attack as soon as possible. He stayed in Hunan for only nine hours, because he had made a prior appointment with Liu Zhenhua to meet in Hankou on the 2nd, and it was inconvenient to delay, so he took a special express train from Hunan at 5:00 pm on the 1st and returned to Hankou. He did not inspect the troops along the way. At 8:00 am on the 2nd, the train arrived in Wuchang. He got off the train and changed ferries to cross the river and went directly to the Pacification Headquarters to work. He made a statement to reporters, saying, "I was sent by Chairman Chiang to Hunan to participate in the inauguration ceremony of Commander-in-Chief He Yunqiao. I met with Hunan generals such as Liu Jianxu and Li Jue in Hunan. There are already meticulous plans for suppressing the remaining bandits. All the generals will return to their defenses separately on the 2nd. Commander-in-Chief He is responsible for the important task of supervising the suppression of the Western Route, and is now coordinating the military and setting off for Pingxiang within days to command. The headquarters will be set up in Changsha, and an advance camp will be set up in Pingxiang to control the situation. He is prudent in his work, and the bandit suppression can be optimistic in the future. Because General Commander Liu Xueya was passing through Hankou on his way to Henan, I returned to Hankou to wait for him. After meeting with him, I will go to central and eastern Hubei to inspect."</p>
<p>(Hankou Meeting) The Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Henan-Hubei border area, Liu Zhenhua, said that the Red Bandits in the Henan-Hubei border area were rampant and needed to go to Huangchuan to supervise the suppression, and needed to consult with Director He Chengjun and Chief of Staff Cao Haosen of the Headquarters on everything, so he took a postal flight from Anqing to Hankou at 2:00 pm on the 2nd. When he arrived in Jiujiang, the plane was damaged and landed in Xunyang. That night, he changed to the Dehe wheel and went west. He arrived in Hankou at 3:00 pm on the afternoon of the 3rd. That night, Director He hosted a banquet to wash the dust, and then Liu, He, and Cao had a meeting. Dai Minquan, commander of the 45th Division, Song Tiancai, commander of the 75th Division, Shangguan Yunxiang, commander of the 47th Division, representing Chu Hongjun, Zhang Ping, commander of the 30th Army, representing Zhang Ziping, Liu Gangfu, representing Wei Lihuang, commander of the Bandit Suppression in Eastern Hubei, and Hao Mengling, commander of the 54th Division, representing Xue Yuzhen, also went to pay their respects and ask for instructions. It is heard that the result of the Liu, He, and Cao meeting was to comply with the order of General Chiang to eliminate the Red Bandits in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui within three months. The deployment of the troops was largely the same as the decision made at the Hankou Bandit Suppression Meeting on the 8th of last month, but the pursuit and interception were adjusted according to the environment and adapted to the situation. Liu was originally scheduled to go to Huangchuan on the 4th, but it has now been decided to take office in Hankou. Liu told reporters, "The headquarters for bandit suppression in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has been arranged in Huangchuan, and the troops east of the railway have also been properly deployed according to orders. I will go to Huangchuan to supervise the suppression after taking office in Hankou, determined to follow General Chiang's intention to eliminate the remaining bandits in three months and handle the aftermath in six months. I have come here to consult with Director He and Chief of Staff Cao on how to proceed. There are meticulous plans for the suppression, and the primary task of the aftermath is to stabilize the people's hearts, because the people's hearts must be stable before the aftermath can be started. As for my concurrent position in Anhui's political affairs, I will be fair in employing people, and strive to save money in financial management. Other construction and education matters will also be based on benefiting the country and the people. After I leave, the provincial government will be represented by Ma Lingfu, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs. I will not return to Anhui until the small bandits on the three borders are eliminated." (3rd)</p>
<p>(Suzhou) Reactions to the Levying of the Fishery Construction Donation: The Fresh Fish Trade Association and the Embroidery Industry Association of Wu County believe that the Fishery Construction Donation Collection Office has violated the ministry's orders and arbitrarily sent police to forcibly collect the fishery construction donation, which is deemed illegal and disturbing. The fishermen are unable to bear the burden. They specially presented a request to the Ministry of Industry yesterday (4th), requesting strict orders to stop the forced collection, and requesting a prompt investigation to prevent Suzhou merchants, etc. Before the Ministry's order is received, all fish shops will temporarily suspend the collection on behalf of the office.</p>
<h3 id="e83">(Wuxi) The Fourth Day of the Cocoon Market Opening <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the spring cocoon market opening. The price of fresh cocoons received by cocoon shops in various villages still varies greatly. Villagers in places such as Shitangwan will not sell cocoons unless they reach a certain price, so the cocoon price in that area has risen to 60 yuan. In other places such as Zhangjingqiao, Yuqi, Zhouxinzhen, Qianqiao, Huadafangzhuang, Dongfangqian, and Hudai Rihuibiao, the highest cocoon price is around 50 yuan, and the wholesale price ranges from about 42-43 yuan to 48-49 yuan. However, the cocoon price in Nanqiao is the cheapest, with the highest price being 40 yuan and the wholesale price being 38 yuan. The goods arriving in various villages are all booming. The Guangcheng cocoon shop in Yanqiao suddenly closed its scales yesterday afternoon, causing disputes. Yesterday, Zhenhua and another cocoon shop also reported their opening, for a total of 219 shops. Tan Xihong, Director of the Forestry and Reclamation Department of the Ministry of Industry, and Dong Xiujia, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, are paying close attention to the cocoon market in this county. They are deeply afraid that cocoon merchants will release their positions and indiscriminately collect cocoons. Yesterday, they specially ordered Yan County magistrate to pay close attention. In addition, the business tax of the cocoon shops in this county was originally handled by the Construction Bureau. Now that the Construction Bureau has been abolished, it is handled by the technicians' office of the county government. In addition to sending Ding to be stationed in the cocoon industry association, Zhang Fulin, the director of technology, also sent a letter to the association requesting a copy of the reported cocoon shops for verification. The original tooth tax has now been renamed cocoon shop business tax, with each shop paying one yuan. There is also a business special tax, with each stove also paying one yuan. The business tax is filled out by the technology office itself.</p>
<h3 id="e84">(Zhenjiang) Anhui Rice is Allowed to be Shipped Based on Letters <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously approved the telegram from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration, stating that Anhui rice and cattle transported through the Beijing-Shanghai Railway were repeatedly detained by military police along the way due to misunderstandings. The Deputy Director of the Transportation Department, Yuan Shaochang, was sent to the Provincial Government Secretariat and the Construction Department to discuss the matter. It is now proposed to instruct the military and police along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to verify the special tax vouchers issued by the counties for the transportation of cattle passing through Anhui Province. The disabled old cattle and farming cattle purchased in Jiangsu Province, which are transported by train to and from the province, are also not subject to the ban on transportation and must be verified and released at any time to avoid misunderstandings and detention. It was approved by the 579th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, and it was resolved that rice is allowed to be shipped, and cattle will be handled separately. The Provincial Government has now ordered the Civil Affairs Department to transfer instructions to the police along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to comply with the regulations. In the future, Anhui rice transported by boat, arriving in Zhenjiang along the river, and not transferred to factories or warehouses, and directly transferred to trains for transportation, does not require a passport from this government, and should be verified and released based on the certification letter from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, and a letter should be sent to the Commander of the Military Police for verification.</p>

<p>In the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, bandits have recently appeared from time to time, disturbing the local area. A group of more than two hundred bandits suddenly rushed to the east of Xinqiao Station north of Bengbu, hoping to loot. The director of the Jinpu Railway Police Section, Qi, heard the alarm and immediately reported to Wang Kaizhen, the regimental commander of the 37th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the 7th Division, requesting that a team be sent to suppress them. After receiving the report, Wang immediately sent the entire 3rd Battalion of his troops to suppress them last night (2nd) at 12:00 pm. According to reports, the bandits have been defeated.</p>

However, most of them have already taken the German postal steamship "Scharnhorst" in Germany to return home. That ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 8th. As for the exact number of people on board the same ship as Generals Su and Ma this time, no telegram has been received, so it is impossible to know. Wu Huanzhang, Lang Guanpu, Dong Chaoran, Duan Zhongfan, Jiang Songnian, Liang Jingkang, and Ma’s son Ma Kui, along with Su’s representatives Fan Ruizheng, and Su’s son Su Zongjun, more than ten people who went to Hong Kong from Shanghai to greet them, are all traveling together to Shanghai.</p>

Then, they will go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and request military guidance. Ma's son, Ma Kui, has already rented No. 28, Sande Lane, Luban Road, as his father's residence. Su's nephew, Su Zongshi, has also rented the Dadong Hotel as Su's lodging. However, whether Generals Ma and Su will actually reside there will be decided after their arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Sun Ke Discusses the Course of the Lushan Conference <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Army's Coercion and the Treacherous Activities of Traitors Forced a Ceasefire</p>
<p>It Was Agreed That Politics Would Not Be Involved and That Military Authorities Would Preside</p>
<p>With the Rise of Feng's Army, Japan Used It as an Excuse to Attack Chahar, Creating a Critical Situation</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing, accompanied by Legislative Committee Member Ma Chaojun, Secretary Lü Guang, and others, to visit his mother and to discuss the draft constitution with Constitution Drafting Committee Member Wu Jingxiong and others. Mr. Sun received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The main points of his discussion are as follows:</p>
<p>(Lushan Conference) Mr. Sun first stated that the gathering of key Central figures in Lushan this time was not a formal meeting but merely a discussion to exchange ideas. All important issues were discussed, including the ceasefire agreement, the suppression of communists, the Southwest problem, Mr. Feng's affairs, and the National People's Congress. The ceasefire agreement was based entirely on military principles, with no mention of any political or diplomatic issues. Regarding the Southwest and Mr. Feng's affairs, it was planned to send people to explain the situation. The provisional National People's Congress was changed to a formal meeting on November 12th.</p>
<p>(Ceasefire Process) Regarding the process of signing the ceasefire agreement in North China this time, after the Japanese army occupied the area south of the Great Wall and coerced Tianjin and Beiping, our side was in a military impasse because the Great Wall line had completely fallen and Nantianmen was also lost. At the same time, the Japanese side presented a memorandum to us, stating that if the ceasefire agreement was not accepted, the Japanese army would attack Beiping and Tianjin. Under these circumstances, the Central Government painfully negotiated a ceasefire with the Japanese side. Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Affairs Committee, consulted with He Yingqin, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and jointly telegraphed the Central Government for instructions. After the Central Government considered the results, the following principles were decided: (1) The agreement would be limited to oral agreements and would not be written. (2) No buffer zones would be established. (3) It would be limited to military affairs and would not include political affairs. (4) The meeting would be handled solely by military authorities on both sides, with no participation from diplomatic or political officials. As a result, the Japanese side did not agree to points two and three, but our side, needing to deal with both resistance to Japan and traitors, had no choice but to amend and sign the existing agreement, excluding any political issues, to the Japanese memorandum. As for the rumors of recognizing "Manchukuo," that is definitely not the case. The matter of creating "Manchukuo" relates to the entire change in the international situation, and not only is it absolutely impossible for our country to recognize it, but it is also impossible for the international community to recognize it.</p>
<p>(Southwest Problem) Mr. Sun continued by saying that the comrades in the Southwest, as well as Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and others, opposed the ceasefire in their telegrams, all because they did not understand the situation in North China. The Central Government has already telegraphed an explanation and should be able to understand the actual situation and appreciate the difficulties. The suppression of the communists by troops from the Southwest is also progressing. In short, everyone must understand the facts and cooperate to fight the communists and resist Japan in order to have a solution.</p>
<p>(Feng's Resistance Against Japan) The fighting in the Tianjin-Beiping area has now ended. A demilitarized zone has been established between the Chinese and Japanese armies, so there will be no conflict for the time being. However, since Mr. Feng Yuxiang has independently raised the banner of resistance against Japan, the Japanese side has paid considerable attention. The Japanese army along the Great Wall is now moving towards the northwest to concentrate, and is about to attack Chahar Province. Feng's army is also advancing south from Duolun, attempting to attack Zhangjiakou. The situation in Chahar Province is extremely critical. Mr. Feng only has 3,000 guards, and in addition, there are a small number of mixed troops, making their strength extremely weak. If the national army inside the pass sends reinforcements to Chahar Province, there is deep concern that it will cause Mr. Feng's misunderstanding, so it is difficult for the Central Government to send troops to assist. Huang Yingbai, chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, has now dispatched representatives to meet with Feng in Chahar to discuss everything so that Chahar Province will not fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>(National Congress) At the time, everyone at the provisional National People's Congress believed that the North China incident was important and wanted to unite all comrades outside the party to save the situation together. Later, the Southwest misunderstood the nature of the congress and opposed it in a telegram. Now the Central Government believes that the provisional congress had no such provisions and has never been held. At the same time, preparations were not completed, so it was decided to change it to the Fifth National Congress on November 12, a formal meeting to discuss and resolve all major issues.</p>
<p>(Dealing with Traitors) When the situation in Tianjin and Beiping was critical, many traitors in Tianjin and Beiping were bought by the Japanese side. The most prominent were Zhang Jingyao, Qi Xieyuan, Sun Chuanfang, and Shi Yousan. Zhang received 1.8 million yuan in Tianjin, specifically to instigate traitors and buy off our army and politicians. After Zhang Jingyao was assassinated, the evidence obtained was colorful and all-encompassing, such as attempting to establish a North China military government, plotting a second puppet state, and so on. These actions not only sacrificed Tianjin and Beiping but also affected the entire country. Therefore, considering the overall situation, a temporary ceasefire was definitely necessary in order to reorganize everything.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association Seeks to Stop the Sichuan War <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's General Meeting of Members</p>
<p>The Anti-War Association Also Sent Members to Attend</p>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai was established on May 31st of last year and has now reached its anniversary. Yesterday afternoon, the Second General Meeting of Members was held in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, attended by more than three hundred new and old members, as well as Zhu Yakui, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zeng Zhaomen, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Yunsheng, representative of the Public Security Bureau, Liu Changwei Zhanen, member of the Abolish Civil War Association, and Secretary Gu Shoutang. Chairman Huang Fogong reported the purpose of the meeting.</p>
<p>After the representatives delivered their speeches, Liu Zhanen, representing the Anti-War Association, explained the process of repeatedly stopping the civil war in Sichuan Province. Following that, the association discussed and proposed many motions, and the meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report After the opening of the meeting, Huang Fogong, chairman of the general meeting, first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by an opening speech, which stated briefly: "Today, our association is holding its second general meeting of members, and we are greatly honored to have the party and government agencies and all sectors come to guide us. From now on, our association should unite with collective wisdom and efforts and repay the country and society."</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches Then Zhu Yakui, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave a speech, stating briefly: "Your association has only been established for a year, and its achievements are remarkable, which is extremely admirable. From now on, we hope that you will work even harder." Next, Liu Zhanen, representative of the Anti-War Association, gave a speech, stating briefly: "Today, the fellow-provincials of Sichuan in Shanghai are here, joyfully holding a general meeting of members, while our hometown is suffering from the flames of warlord warfare, which is heartbreaking. The Anti-War Association, based on its mission, has repeatedly researched and discussed, and repeatedly telegraphed to appeal for ways to eliminate it, but it has not achieved the greatest effect, which is deeply regrettable. Today, the motions proposed by your association are paying great attention to the Sichuan War, which I am even more deeply moved by. However, abolishing civil war cannot be done by one organization or one local people, but must be done by all the people of the country, uniting together and working together. I deeply hope that your association will cooperate with the Anti-War Association in the future to jointly discuss ways to stop the civil war. Recently, our association requested the central government to stop the transportation of military supplies to Sichuan by any province in order to fundamentally solve the civil war. However, your association must proceed together, such as investigating the origin of the internal strife of the Sichuan warlords and persuading the warlords to discover their conscience. If these points cannot be realized, we should make a firm decision not to cooperate with the Sichuan warlords. First, friendship does not cooperate; if representatives such as Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui come to Shanghai, we must not pay attention to them. Second, economic cooperation does not cooperate; if they privately import military supplies, you can explore and announce their secrets. Third, make a great determination to go to Sichuan to work hard for national salvation, etc., all of which have a great effect on stopping the civil war."</p>
<p>Discussion of the Sichuan War The meeting believes that the people of Sichuan Province have repeatedly suffered tragic wars due to the internal strife of the warlords, with the people living in misery. Therefore, it proposed to discuss the opposition to the Sichuan warlords continuing the civil war. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Opposition to the Sichuan warlords continuing to fight each other: (A) Telegraph to the central government, ordering the Sichuan warlords to stop fighting immediately and severely punish those who violate the order; (B) Submit a request to the central government to send personnel back to Sichuan to supervise the military to implement the disbandment of the troops; (C) Submit a request to the central government to strictly order two-thirds of the troops under Sichuan's jurisdiction to go to Xikang to consolidate national defense, and one-third to go out of Sichuan to assist in resisting Japan; (D) This association will send a telegram to the people of the whole country to oppose civil war; (E) Send a telegram to all fellow-provincials in Sichuan, to awaken and go on strike to oppose civil war; (F) Request the central government to expel the representatives of the Sichuan warlords stationed in Beijing in the near future; (G) Ask the central government to strictly stop the transportation of military supplies to Sichuan to supply the warlords' civil war; (H) Organize an appraisal committee to confiscate the deposits of the Sichuan warlords stored in Shanghai and various banks in other provinces; (2) Opposition to the Sichuan warlords' imposition of all kinds of exorbitant taxes: (A) This association will submit a request to the central government to order the Sichuan warlords to immediately abolish all kinds of exorbitant taxes; (B)</p>
<p>Send a telegram to all sectors of the people in Sichuan to awaken and go on strike to oppose all kinds of exorbitant taxes; (C) In the future, if any events of opposition to exorbitant taxes occur in Sichuan, this association should provide substantial assistance and send a telegram to the whole country for assistance; (3) Submit a request to the government to issue a notice to schools across the country to exempt students from the "red" areas such as Tong, Nan, and Ba from tuition fees: (A) Submit a request to the government to forward to the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to schools across the country to exempt students from the "red" areas such as Tong, Nan, and Ba from tuition fees; (B) This association will raise donations from fellow-provincials and other people with lofty ideals to help overseas students from Tong, Nan, and Ba and other places who are on the verge of desperation; (C) Request the government to issue a notice to schools to offer full or partial exemption from tuition fees for students in areas affected by natural disasters and war.</p>
<p>Re-electing Officials After the discussion, the officials were re-elected. It was planned to elect 25 executive committee members, 9 alternate members, 15 supervisory committee members, and 7 alternate members. The list was not announced due to the lateness of the hour.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Duan Honggang Describes Duan Qirui's Condition <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Duan Is Old and Lacks Energy</p>
<p>The German Doctor Plans to Give a Blood Transfusion</p>
<p>Duan Hongye Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that Duan Qirui is ill in Shanghai and is being treated by German doctor Mi Aili. The reporter visited Duan's nephew, Mr. Honggang, yesterday and was granted an interview. When asked about Duan's condition, he said that Mr. Duan's illness is not as serious as rumors suggest. Only on the 27th of last month (i.e., the 4th of this month in the lunar calendar), he accidentally coughed up a few mouthfuls of blood, and there was a slight amount of blood in his stool. At that time, Dr. Mi (Aili) was consulted, and it was found that there were slight cracks in the blood vessels in his stomach, which caused the blood to come out of his mouth. That is also where the origin of his coughing up blood lies. However, it stopped after taking medicine. It has been more than ten days since then, and his eating and sleeping have returned to normal. However, he is old and lacks energy, and his blood and nutrition are insufficient after coughing up blood. This is a common phenomenon for patients and is not important. Today (i.e., yesterday), it is planned to wait for the doctor to come again for a diagnosis, and I (Honggang) will give a blood transfusion once, needing an amount of about 300 to 400 cc. The blood in my body has also been diagnosed by the doctor and determined to be usable. Therefore, after Mr. Duan receives the blood transfusion, his physical strength may be even stronger. My older brother, Hongye, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin at 4:00 PM yesterday. However, he wanted to come south earlier and did not come to Shanghai because of Duan's illness. As for the report in today's newspaper that Mr. Duan is critically ill in Shanghai and that his coffin made of Phoebe nanmu has been transported south from Tianjin, I can truthfully declare that this has not happened. After the conversation, he took his leave and departed.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Auditing Committee of the Central Mint Will Regularly Inspect New Coins <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Second Review Meeting Will Be Held on the 9th</p>
<p>The Auditing Committee for New Coins of the Central Mint was announced last month and held its first meeting. It is now learned that the committee is scheduled to hold its second auditing meeting at 4:30 PM on the 9th of this month on the third floor of the Central Bank. At that time, the following motions will be discussed: (1) Draft rules of procedure; (2) Appoint a chemical analyst to chemically analyze the fineness of the new coins; (3) Assess the factory's affairs and audit the accounts. It is heard that the inspection method will be to randomly select one or two coins from every 10,000 new coins cast for chemical analysis. If their fineness and weight comply with the law, a certificate will be issued and they will be allowed to circulate on the market; otherwise, they will be remelted and recast. Currently, the factory's new coin molds can produce more than 200,000 yuan per day. Once the inspection is qualified, they can be circulated on the market.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Representatives Petitioning for the Refund of Artificial Silk Import Tax Will Enter Beijing Tonight <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Industrial General Federation</p>
<p>Helping the Silk Industry Send Members to Beijing to Petition Together</p>
<p>The Shanghai Motor Silk Weaving Factory and the Silk and Satin Industry Association, in view of the severe decline in the foreign trade of silk fabrics, plan to ask the government to refund the import tax on artificial silk in order to reduce costs and help the industry. On the 21st of last month, the two industries held a joint meeting and decided to organize a petition delegation, scheduled to enter Beijing by train on the night of June 5th, stay at the Central Hotel, and go to various ministries and courtyards the next day to petition. At the same time, they sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Industrial Federation, requesting them to send additional representatives to provide assistance. At its 37th standing committee meeting, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce decided to publicly recommend Wang Yansong, a standing committee member, as a supporting representative to accompany them to Beijing. The Chinese Industrial Federation, especially because the refund of the artificial silk import tax concerns the life and death of the entire Chinese silk industry, expressed great sympathy for participating in the petition. They also notified the Suzhou-Hangzhou branch earlier, invited silk merchants to come to Shanghai, and convened a discussion meeting at the general association at No. 9 Hankou Road at 4:00 PM yesterday, and recommended Qian Chengxu to be a representative to go to Beijing to depart together. It can be seen that this request to the government to refund the artificial silk import tax is to save the industry from bankruptcy, and the survival of the silk weaving and silk satin industries in our country is deeply and greatly related. Therefore, all industrial and commercial organizations in this city attach great importance to the progress of this case and do not hesitate to sacrifice their spirit and express their strength to assist. The prospect of the petition is very promising. It is thought that there will be an even more enthusiastic atmosphere when the petition delegation departs from Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Case of Inspecting Factories in the Concession Will Continue to Be Discussed This Week <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Hoping for a Smooth Resolution</p>
<p>Regarding the negotiation of the right to inspect factories in the Public Concession, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, once exchanged views unofficially last month, and after preliminary consultations, their views were quite close. They then agreed to study the detailed implementation plan separately and set a date for further consultations. It was originally scheduled to continue the discussion on the second or third day of this month, that is, last Tuesday or Wednesday. Later, because the implementation plan still needed to be studied in detail to facilitate the resolution of the consultations, the second consultation meeting did not take place last week. Yesterday, it was heard that the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council have scheduled to continue formal consultations this week. The formal resolution of the case must wait until the second meeting between Yu and Fessenden. According to relevant parties, it is predicted that the case will be resolved smoothly in the future.</p>

<p>Major Commercial Ports Will Add Commercial Agencies</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that since the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the Russian Merchants Assistance Association in this city has been actively seeking ways to dump Russian goods in China. Therefore, Lai Wen, manager of the association, returned to the Russian capital last month to discuss the transportation of Russian goods to China with the Russian government's commercial authorities. It is also heard that the Russian Merchants Assistance Association will add commercial agencies in major commercial ports in our country after Lai Wen returns to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Alliance of Six Shipping Companies</p>
<h3 id="e94">Major Changes in River Shipping in Sichuan, Chinese Small Steamers Are All Defeated <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Since the alliance of the six major companies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the small steamer companies operating between Yichang and Chongqing have all been defeated. Of the ten or so shipping companies, only one or two are currently operating. Director Ren of the Yichang Shipping Association came to Shanghai from the Sichuan River and informed us of the current situation of shipping in the Yichang-Chongqing area, which is described as follows: Cooperation of Six Companies River shipping from Shanghai to Yichang and from Yichang to Chongqing. Shanghai has no direct ships to Chongqing. Therefore, there were many Chinese ships operating on the Yichang-Chongqing route. At its peak, there were seventeen or eighteen companies. Since last year, foreign merchant ships in Shanghai, such as Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, etc., have added direct routes to Chongqing in the upper reaches, monopolizing the goods transported from Shanghai to the Sichuan River, making it impossible for the small steamer companies on the Yichang-Chongqing route to support themselves. They have stopped sailing one after another, and Minsheng Company has raised funds to buy the Chinese ships that have stopped sailing to form a new force of Chinese merchants in the Sichuan River. From then on, the Yichang-Chongqing route has been transformed into the Shanghai-Chongqing route. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants Sanbei, and Minsheng are the six companies that have implemented cooperative operations.</p>
<p>Increasing the Price of Shanghai-Yichang Shipping All six companies' river ships in Sichuan have been changed to direct Shanghai-Chongqing routes. The Yichang-Chongqing section is now only operated by Jufu, Yihua, Yongfu, and other companies. In order to compete for the Sichuan River shipping industry and maintain the long-term interests of the Shanghai-Chongqing route, the six companies have repeatedly reduced the water freight rate on the Shanghai-Chongqing route, from twelve taels to seven taels. At the same time, the rate from Yichang to Chongqing has been increased to six taels, so that Shanghai customers will transport goods to Sichuan directly from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sale of Small Steamers Due to the alliance of the six companies, direct Shanghai-Chongqing routes have been created, causing the old route from Yichang to Chongqing to become naturally abandoned and eliminated. Now the Yongyou steamship, which operates on the Yichang-Chongqing route, has no wharf warehouse in Shanghai and is heard to be sold to a Chinese steamship company in Shanghai, while the Yongnian and Yongfeng ships will be bought by Minsheng Company. From then on, no Chinese ships will operate on the Yichang-Chongqing route. The Sichuan River shipping industry will soon be operated by the six companies.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Business Due to the situation in Sichuan, many merchants are hesitant to handle goods, and the exchange rate between Sichuan and Shanghai currencies is that every 1,000 yuan of Shanghai currency requires more than 1,600 yuan of Sichuan currency. Due to the unfavorable exchange rate, they have stopped handling goods, and business has declined to an extreme degree. In addition, Liu Xiang's ban prohibits the export of cash, and anyone who privately exports 10 yuan of silver will be severely punished if caught. Therefore, business is even more affected. Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have each reduced one ship, and the Sanbei Wuxing ship is currently under repair and will be opened soon. However, it is heard that Japanese ships in Sichuan that have been stopped for a year and a half are now planning to resume sailing.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Japanese Government Urges Yokotake to Come to Shanghai, Textile Industry Association Expresses Serious Concerns <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Amidst the news of Yokotake's arrival in Shanghai, the Textile Industry Association issued a serious declaration, stating (above omitted): Upon investigation, the cruelty and insidiousness of Japanese imperialism are known to all Chinese men, women, and children. Anticipation of future hatred is likely even greater than it is today. Indeed, driven by the sharp edge of their aggression, it has penetrated the hearts of the people. Therefore, there is no possibility of amicable relations between our countries. Yet, a dispatch from the Domei News Agency on June 2nd stated that the Japanese Foreign Ministry intends to seize this opportunity to adopt a friendly policy towards China. It claims that since the September 18th Incident, although Chinese and Japanese troops have faced each other on the battlefield, the people of both countries remain as friendly as ever. Furthermore, it states that a new policy will be implemented towards China, transforming to an active friendliness, even ordering Yokotake, a commercial official who had only recently returned to his country, to immediately return to Shanghai to resume his duties, seizing this opportunity to reopen trade between the two countries. Arbitrarily bombing defenseless people is a customary tactic of the Japanese militarists. What friendliness can the people possibly have towards them? The "friendliness" they speak of probably refers to a group of treacherous merchants and individuals like Pu Yi. Yokotake returned to his country not long ago due to the expiration of commercial treaties. What is the scope of his mission now that he is being urged to come? There is suspicion that they intend to seek the renewal of new treaties. Rather than calling it a transformation to active friendliness, it would be more accurate to say it is plotting for commercial gains. The textile industry is essential for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The lessons learned in the past have been the most profound. However, it also represents the largest portion of national economic bankruptcy. Domestic goods are already on the verge of extinction. If their treacherous schemes are successful, the people of our country will truly not know where to die, and will not know what shame in this world is. It is hoped that those in power will carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages, maintain the loopholes in the defenses, and consider the continued livelihood of the people. No matter how friendly they appear, they must be rejected outright. It is also hoped that all sectors will be wary, prevent trouble, show sympathy, and strive for self-strengthening, working to reclaim our lost territories and save the fate of the entire nation and its people. This declaration is made with utmost sincerity.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society received a telegram from Beijing yesterday. The Beijing General Association of the Society received a letter from the Tangshan Tenth Relief Team stationed in Tangshan, stating briefly that during the recent turmoil in Tangshan, bandits took the opportunity to loot, and the people's homes were completely emptied. The people fled in a panic. The cruelty and suffering were unprecedented. The team members went out to provide relief and took in more than 1,900 refugee women and children. A total of more than 3,700 women and children were sheltered in the four locations. Because the relief personnel were insufficient, additional personnel were sent to the treatment centers and shelters to treat more than 500 wounded and sick soldiers and civilians in rotation. Now the situation in the area has stabilized slightly, and more than 900 refugees, women, and children have returned home. However, 2,800 refugees still remain in the four locations. After returning home, they found their homes completely emptied. They lack clothing and food. Those whose houses were destroyed by artillery fire live in makeshift shelters, exposed to the wind and rain. The need for relief is extremely urgent.</p>

<p>Organizing Burial Teams | | | Going to Huoshan to Work</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the head of Zhufuoan in Huoshan, reporting that there are more than 18,000 corpses of people who died tragically in the river beach of Zhufuoan Mountain in Huoshan. When they were killed, most of them were decapitated, or dismembered. The various tragic scenes were unbearable to witness. Afterwards, local people buried them in sand and soil in 130 large piles. However, the river beach is not a suitable place to bury bones. Once mountain floods occur, the corpses will be washed away and will inevitably float along the Huai River to the Yangtze River, which will inevitably cause a major epidemic. The Shanghai General Office of the Society, in view of this, specially sent Commissioner Zhao Yulin to Hefei and Liu'an to negotiate the organization of a large-scale burial team to relocate these more than 10,000 remains within the shortest possible time to prevent future epidemics. It is heard that Commissioner Zhao arrived in Hefei a few days ago and began to organize the team, and will depart for Huoshan to work immediately.</p>

The original letter states, "Industrialist Yao Yunsheng deeply believes that various ribbons are necessities for packing goods. The widespread sale of foreign goods on the market and the outflow of profits are very regrettable. He has independently founded the China National Goods Machine-Made Ribbon Factory outside Xiaoximen, Shanghai, on Lujiabang Road, Yuli Lane. Using domestic cotton yarn, he machine-makes various colored, wide and narrow, artistic ribbons. The materials are excellent and durable, the colors are bright and do not fade, the manufacturing is precise, the sizes are sufficient, the production is abundant, and the prices are low. Since its launch, it has been quite successful. The society, etc., has dispatched personnel to investigate and verify, and the Ministry of Finance has approved tax exemptions, the Ministry of Industry has registered the business, and the Trademark Bureau has approved the Zhongzhong trademark.

<p>At the Shanghai YMCA, the results of this fundraising convention were announced at 8:00 PM on the third. The 50 teams scored a total of 39,340 points, with 1,266 members, a difference of 10,660 points from the target.

The third place was team 9, led by Mr. Cao Yunxiang, with a score of 2,355. The society's fundraising has reached its 33rd session, and the results of each session have exceeded the original target number, never failing to reach the goal. This time, because the preparation time was rushed, the scores of the teams were not submitted in time, and the general captain, Kong Yongzhi, went to Jiangxi, and the chief of staff, Dr. Wang Rutang, went to Hangzhou. A large number of scores from both places were not sent, resulting in such a large difference. It is heard that the team leaders and members who attended the meeting the night before decided to extend the fundraising convention for one week until the tenth of the month, so that each team would have sufficient time to make a final effort, vowing not to stop until the original goal is exceeded. This spirit of perseverance and cooperation is rare in previous fundraising conventions.</p>

<p>After the Xuehuai Photo Studio was Sealed, Wang Zhongxian Filed an Objection</p>
<p>The Xuehuai Photo Studio opened by Lin Xuehuai in the Guanguan Palace Lane in Suzhou was recently sealed by the Wuxian Local Court, which was consulted by the First Special District Local Court at the request of Hu Die, because it could not fulfill the judgment to repay Hu Die's debt. Now, Wang Zhongxian came forward to raise an objection, saying that all the property of the photo studio, including the rented house deposit, etc., was mortgaged by Lin Xuehuai to him for 1,000 yuan in the past, with Xu Bibo as the intermediary witness. Wang also leased the mortgaged items to Lin, who paid a monthly rent of 20 yuan, and a lease contract was also established. All the deposits and rents were owed by Lin and not paid. According to law, the mortgagee should have priority over the property, etc. He entrusted lawyer Wang Peiyuan to present a special request to the court and file an execution objection. When the execution judge holds a hearing in the future, there will definitely be a debate between the two parties.</p>

<p>The Police Request an Autopsy</p>
<p>The Family Tries to Avoid It</p>
<p>Zhang Shen, a woman from Funing living at No. 9 Hengchang Lane, Binlang Road, was only 23 years old. Because she had borrowed money from Xu Jiang, a fellow villager at No. 7 next door, and was unable to repay it, Xu Jiang went to demand the debt again on the first of this month, resulting in a conflict with Zhang Shen. After being persuaded to disperse, Zhang Shen's anger did not subside, so she bought opium and swallowed it at 3:00 PM that afternoon. When her family noticed, they quickly sent her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but the poison had already attacked her heart and could not be saved. She died that day, and her family prepared a coffin to collect her body. The Puto Road police learned of this and believed that the case involved human life and should be thoroughly investigated. They immediately carried the coffin to the autopsy station on Peel Road. Yesterday morning, they reported to Guo Wei, the prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court, to come to the station. The police also requested lawyer Qian Xunjiu to represent them in requesting an autopsy. However, Zhang Shen's aunt, Zhang Shen, and her uncle, Shen Qidong, both requested to be exempt from the autopsy, saying that the deceased had taken poison on her own and there was no other reason. They represented the maternal family and the husband's family, respectively, and had no objections. However, the police believed that in order to clarify the cause of death, an autopsy was necessary, so they requested Prosecutor Guo to approve it so that they could proceed immediately. Mr. Guo believed that the matter was of great importance and needed to be carefully considered before a decision could be made, so he did not immediately perform the autopsy.</p>

<p>Harassing a Weak Woman and Daring to Commit Assault</p>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</p>
<p>Chen Yueying, a woman from Wenzhou, is twenty-eight years old and has a beautiful appearance. Her family lives in the Aizhulin tourist area at No. 23, Lane 446, Huade Road. At 10:30 PM the night before, she was at home playing cards with her brother, Chen Laosan, and others when Li Afu, a fellow villager, came to chat. Seeing Yueying's delicate and exquisite appearance, he flirted with her in every possible way. When the card game ended, Li Afu forcibly pulled the woman's hand, asking her to go somewhere to play, and provoking her with obscene words. The woman angrily told her brother about the situation. Chen Laosan was furious and asked him sternly. Afu refused to show weakness and spoke disrespectfully. Chen Laosan slapped him once. Afu was ashamed and unable to bear it. He took out a small foreign knife from his pocket and stabbed Laosan three times in the left chest, and fled out the door. The woman was shocked and ran to tell her elder brother Laoer, who chased and caught Afu and fought each other. The Chinese police officer No. 1444 of the lane heard the alarm and arrived, and after learning the details, helped to arrest Li Afu and sent him to the Yulin Road police station. The head of the police station ordered him to be detained. The police also ordered the detectives to send the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. The next morning, the police sent the suspect Li to the third criminal court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the course of events in detail, and said that the suspect's knife was discarded by him at the time and could not be found. He asked for an investigation, and presented the victim's bloody clothes for inspection. Chen Laosan's injuries were still light, and after being bandaged by the doctor, he went to court to complain about the suspect's assault. His elder brother Chen Laoer and his younger sister Chen Yueying testified to the facts. When questioned, the defendant's confession was evasive, and he denied stabbing Chen Laosan with a knife, saying that there were many people who beat him at that time, and he asked for leniency. Judge Wu Zehan, because the evidence was conclusive, and there was no room for sophistry, sentenced Li Afu to six months' imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>Li Zhongren, Li Shutang</p>
<p>Jin, the district chief of the Second District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was secretly instructed by Director Wen to open a case based on a joint petition sealed by dozens of stores, including the Dachunghua Restaurant, in the Gaochang Temple area. The petition stated that the thugs in the Gaochang Temple area (northerners) are mostly people who were expelled from the army or police station after serving as military police in the past. There are five people, including Li Zhongren (Xiao Li'er) and Li Shutang, who specialize in occupying Gaochang Temple, extorting money from various stores, and doing all kinds of evil without regard for the law. The residents and shops in the area have suffered countless losses from them and cannot bear it any longer. They requested that the police district concerned be instructed to strictly arrest and punish them. After Jin, the district chief, was ordered, he secretly sent reconnaissance team leader Wu Xiufeng and Li Xiaobao to Gaochang Temple to investigate. Yesterday, they arrested Li Zhongren (Xiao Li'er) and Li Shutang at the Wufugong Teahouse and Tang Jinji Dismantling Shipyard, respectively, and brought them to the district. District Chief Jin briefly interrogated them and prepared a document to report to the Third Section of the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Dismissed Constable Impersonating Official to Extort Money <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Wei Dingshan, a native of Jiangbei, thirty years old this year, formerly served as Hua constable No. 244 in the French Concession police force. Because during an assignment, he privately embezzled a certain Mr. Jia's opium and forcibly stripped Mr. Jia of his clothes, the police force investigated and immediately dismissed him. Afterwards, Wei became unemployed. Unexpectedly, recently, Wei had another bizarre idea. In the area of McDonald Road and Jules Pasteurs Road in the New Concession, whenever he saw someone defecating in the wasteland, he would impersonate a plainclothes detective from the police force and extort money. Countless people have been fooled. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at 5:30 AM, Qiu Miaogen, who lived at Liu's residence on McDonald Road, and Wang Awu, who lived at No. 7 Wule Lane on McDonald Road, were defecating in a nearby open space when Wei saw them. Wei approached them and said, "How dare you defecate here? I am a plainclothes detective from the police force." After saying this, he detained the two of them, as if intending to take them to the police station. First, Qiu Miaogen pleaded with him, offering to pay a bribe of six jiao in foreign currency to be released. Wei feigned disapproval. Qiu increased the offer to one yuan, and Wei finally agreed to release him. Wang, however, had no money to bribe, which led to a dispute. Coincidentally, Chinese constables Nos. 381, 104, and 196 from the Avenue Edward VII police station were patrolling and saw what was happening. They approached and inquired. Wei changed his story and impersonated a sanitation worker, speaking evasively. Therefore, the constables detained Wei and took him to the police station. He was then sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. First, the police lawyer, Yao Zhaodi, explained the case, stating that the police force was prosecuting the defendant under Article 370 of the Criminal Code. Then, the plaintiffs, Qiu Miaogen and Wang Awu, recounted the previous events. When questioned, Wei Dingshan admitted to impersonating a public official and extorting money. After Judge Zhang reviewed the confession, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the sentencing.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 12:30 PM, five robbers suddenly entered the home of Da Yunsheng at No. 16 Delin Lane, Tiantong Road, Zhabei, through the back door. They spoke with a Jiangbei accent and wore short blue-black cloth shirts and pants. Two of the robbers carried handguns. They first put all the family members under guard, threatening them to keep silent, and then began to search and rob the house. After about an hour, they fled with their loot. After the incident, the homeowner inspected his belongings and discovered that twenty-five pearls, one hundred and thirteen yuan in banknotes, one gold needle, two pairs of gold earrings, and one pair of small gold bracelets had been stolen. He immediately reported the incident to the Third Division of the Fifth District police station, requesting an investigation.

<p>Stray Bullet Wounds Russian Constable and Rickshaw Puller</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10:45 PM, the Public Concession Police Department dispatched Chinese and Western detectives, traveling in a car, to report to the special agency of the French Concession Police on Rue Massenet, stating that three Indian criminal suspects had been spotted watching a movie at the Golden Grand Theater at the corner of Rue du Consulat and Rue de Saigon, and requested assistance in their apprehension. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately dispatched Russian Constable No. 44, along with several Chinese and Annamite detectives, to the address. Upon arriving at the destination, the detectives waited outside the theater. At 11:15 PM, as the theater emptied and people streamed out, the three Indian suspects emerged from the crowd. The detectives immediately moved in to arrest them, capturing two of the suspects on the spot. The other suspect resisted fiercely. As an Annamite detective grabbed him, the suspect struggled to escape, fleeing south. He pulled a handgun from his pocket and resisted arrest. The detectives also drew their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged six or seven shots. A bullet grazed the forehead of Russian Constable No. 44, and a stray bullet wounded a rickshaw puller in the leg. As a result, the suspect ultimately escaped. The detectives then took the two Indian suspects to the Rue Massenet police station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, he ordered them to be handed over to the detectives who had reported the information. The wounded Russian constable and rickshaw puller were taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>

Mr. Cai Yuanpei presided and delivered a speech, stating that Chinese culture has a history of thousands of years, and the invention of printing was earlier than in other countries. However, because our country lacks the materials to present to the world, other countries have not been able to have a deep understanding of us. Now, the China International Library is engaged in this work, so that Chinese and Western cultures can be connected, and the future of world cooperation will depend on this. Next, Mr. Cui Zhuhan read Mr. Zhang Jingjiang's congratulatory message. Then, Mr. Wu Zhihui delivered a speech, saying that although the world today has no justice, we must firmly believe in the existence of justice. If we want to see justice prevail, then we must first gain the sympathy of those who have it in the international community. Therefore, various international cooperation projects are of great benefit to us. The China International Library contributes systematic materials to the international community, so that people can have a deeper understanding of us. This is fortunate for world cooperation and for justice. Finally, Mr. Li Shizeng, in his capacity as a representative, reported on the establishment of the China International Library in great detail. Mr. Li first described the motivation for establishing the China International Library, then described the role of its establishment, and finally stated his hopes for the library, and hoped that all sectors would provide guidance and help. After the report was completed, the guests spoke, with Mr. Xu Jingren and others giving concise speeches, and immediately agreeing to serve as founders of the library, so that everyone can work together to achieve complete success. Then, Mr. Li Shizeng led a tour of the rooms. The guests praised the exquisite arrangement and comprehensive equipment of the various departments, and it was 8 o'clock when the meeting ended.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Ji Zhang Commits Suicide <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>| Wang Desheng's Actual |</p>
<p>Ji Zhang, a 43-year-old woman from Yancheng, was married to Ji Siya, who farmed in their hometown. They had two sons. The elder son, Ji Buquan, 20 years old, was married to Chen, 18 years old. The younger son was named Xiaohongzi, 13 years old. Unexpectedly, Ji Siya fell ill and died at home on August 5th last year, losing the family's support. Ji Buquan was introduced by a friend to work in Longyan County. Ji Zhang, along with her younger son Xiaohongzi and daughter-in-law Ji Chen, came to Shanghai to make a living in January of this year. They built a thatched shed along the Hongqiao in the western part of Shanghai to live in. Her son and daughter-in-law went to work in nearby rope factories. Ji Zhang cooked and washed for her son and daughter-in-law at home, and although they were poor, they felt amiable. In a thatched shed at No. 38 nearby, there was a Shandong man, Wang Desheng, 42 years old, who had no profession and was a rogue. His wife died of illness in January, so he was bored all day and chatted with Ji Zhang's family. Because one was a widower and the other was a new widow, an ambiguity soon arose. In February, the two families merged into one. However, Wang Desheng was brutal and often beat them. At 10 PM the day before yesterday, Ji Zhang and her daughter-in-law went to bed separately. Unexpectedly, Wang Desheng, with a human face but a beast's heart, had long coveted his daughter-in-law, Chen. He sneaked to Chen's bed and raped her. Chen woke up and screamed. Ji Zhang heard the sound and rushed over. Seeing this situation, she was very angry. She pulled Wang Desheng off her and scolded him. Wang became angry and, out of shame, used a sandalwood stick that he usually played with to beat Ji Zhang severely, causing her to be bruised all over and her face covered in blood. Neighbors came out to persuade them, but Wang was unreasonable and poured urine and feces from the chamber pot, so no one could persuade him. At 10:00 AM the next day, Ji Zhang suddenly died. Everyone was shocked and rushed to see her. Ji Zhang committed suicide by hanging herself. Wang untied the body. A rope was taken away by a lottery gambler to pray for a dream. When Ji Chen and Ji Xiaohongzi returned home and saw their mother's tragic death, they went to the Second District Police Station to accuse Wang of murder. The police were dispatched to arrest Wang. According to Wang, the deceased committed suicide because she was angry and tired of the world, and he did not murder or coerce her. The district sent Gu Xueyuan, a local security officer from the Fifth District, to report to the local court. Prosecutor Ouyang came to inspect and determined that she had committed suicide by hanging herself after being injured, and ordered the body to be collected and an investigation to be conducted.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Initiating the Establishment of a Leprosy Hospital <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Charitable and Medical Circles Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health Will Also Organize a Leprosy Association</p>
<p>The facilities for leprosy hospitals are very lacking in various parts of our country, and according to surveys by the medical community, there are nearly one million people in the country suffering from this disease. Therefore, the medical and charitable communities of this port, in view of the terrible contagiousness of leprosy, have decided to raise huge sums of money from all sectors to establish a fully equipped leprosy hospital for the benefit of society. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Infectious areas According to surveys by the medical community, there are a total of two million leprosy patients worldwide, and leprosy patients in our country account for half of them. According to reliable data, among the people of various provinces suffering from this disease, Fujian and Guangdong have the most, followed by Guizhou, followed by Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces. Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang rank fifth, and Gansu ranks sixth. The three northeastern provinces have the fewest. People in other provinces rarely suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>Local facilities As for the establishment of leprosy hospitals in our country, according to a survey of the whole country, Jiangxi has Nanchang Leprosy Hospital, Fujian has Yanping Leprosy Hospital, Guangdong has Beihai Leprosy Hospital, and Qiongya Leprosy Hospital on Hainan Island. There are only more than ten hospitals in total, which can accommodate more than 2,000 people. Xiamen and other places are in the process of preparation. There is also no hospital in this port that specializes in this disease. Only the Hongkou Skin Hospital also treats this disease.</p>
<p>Recent Developments The fundraising for the establishment of leprosy hospitals in our country began in 1925, when the American Leprosy Relief Association sent General Manager Tanner to China to carry out publicity. It is now known that the charitable and medical communities of this port have decided to initiate fundraising from all sectors to establish a fully equipped leprosy hospital in Shanghai. It is also heard that the Ministry of Health of the National Government will organize a Central Leprosy Association in the near future.</p>

<p>But Sent to Prison for Confinement Due to Mental Illness</p>
<p>Police Lawyer Requests Reservation of Right to Appeal</p>
<p>Youergaosha Tuoteni Gaofu, a 24-year-old Russian residing at No. 33, Alley 222, Avenue Albert, French Concession, entered the home of British Indian doctor Tai Xiejiara (transliteration) at No. 120 Rue Luban, French Concession, with a handgun at around 3:00 PM on January 4th of this year and shot Tai Xiejiara to death. Later, his brother Yulaijie (transliteration) reported to the French Concession Police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Youergaosha and send him to the Second Special District Local Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution based on the crime of homicide under the Criminal Code. Judge Xiong Huicheng repeatedly opened the court to interrogate the defendant, who admitted that he went to the deceased for treatment for a stomach illness. After taking the medicine, he developed erectile dysfunction and killed him out of hatred. Subsequently, the defendant's defense lawyers, Xu Yannian, etc., argued that the defendant suffered from mental illness, causing nervous disorder, and therefore the crime was excusable. They requested the appointment of a well-known doctor to identify the defendant's condition, etc. The court ordered the appointment of a doctor for identification. After examining the circumstances of his confession, it was recorded in the previous report that the court had appointed a specialist in mental illness, a Western doctor named Dalai (transliteration), who was designated by the First Special District Court to specialize in the identification of neurological diseases. After a long period of examination, and with the joint appraisal of the Municipal Council's doctors, the defendant was confirmed to have mental illness, and at the time of the incident, he was in a state of extreme nervous disorder. After the doctor issued an appraisal report to the court, a hearing was held again a few days ago, and the debate was declared over. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahan, appeared in court at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday for sentencing. The judge presided over the first criminal court and ordered the defendant to be brought to the court. The defendant, Youergaosha Tuoteni Gaofu, was found not guilty because he suffered from mental illness and was ordered to be detained in prison and sent to an asylum. At that time, the police lawyer immediately requested the reservation of the right to appeal in court, which was approved by the court. After the sentencing, the defendant was escorted to the Second Special District Prison by the bailiffs.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Why Complain About Heaven and Blame Others? <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Wan from Jinan</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter is written with a tearful tone, viewing the current human society as worthless. Indeed, the current social phenomena easily lead to pessimism, but social happiness is originally obtained through struggle. We have not yet participated in this struggle in the slightest and are already complaining about heaven and blaming others, saying how base and dark society is. Society will naturally bluntly reply: If you don't want it to be base and dark, then hurry up and come in and do something. People who stand by with their hands in their pockets and make sarcastic remarks are not qualified to criticize the current society.</p>
<p>It is true that your family and your mother have been sacrificed in this dark society, but have you ever pursued the reason? You must not have pursued this question, so you can only swallow it whole and scold: "The hearts of the Chinese people are selfish and self-interested to the extreme, without knowing shame, without knowing compassion, especially loving to play tricks, loving to bully the weak, loving to fawn on the strong..." In fact, when a society reaches a turning point, the general phenomena are always like this. However, if you study the history of the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution, you will see that at that time, what one saw and heard was nothing but shamelessness and madness, without a sense of right and wrong. The whole society seemed like a stroke-paralyzed corpse. In fact, this is because the old society has reached its end and is entering the grave, like a symbol of a big storm coming. Suddenly, the sky is dark, and everything stops abruptly, the so-called "ten thousand trees are silent, waiting for the rain to come," is such a phenomenon. The transformation of a new era is very magical. As long as its climax arrives, human self-renewal and morality will immediately increase. However, this kind of sun-like ardent life is definitely not something that people with a retreatist mindset like yours can enjoy, who think of "going to the northwest frontier, close to primitive humans, where one can farm and eat for oneself, forget everything before, and start another life of pleasure." Moreover, this kind of thinking is fundamentally a dream: the current northwest, on one side, is influenced by the socialism of Soviet Russia, and on the other side, is being invaded by the "daily attacks" of a certain imperialism. In the near future, it will either become a continuation of "Outer Mongolia" or a second Northeast, and there is absolutely no place for you, who want to "forget everything before" and "start another life of pleasure," to create a "new Peach Blossom Spring." Moreover, I want to ask you: Do you really believe that Chinese society has only produced one good person like you who is "not base, cunning, and only has an ardent heart"? Frankly speaking, from the way you talk, I know that you are still new to society and cannot withstand the fire of society's great furnace. If you enter society like this, you will soon become like the bad people you are so pained and indignant about. Only those who have stumbled countless times in this evil society, but are still themselves, or even "the nature of ginger and cinnamon, the older the spicier," can stand in the current society, can fight with it, and can transform it. To devote oneself to society and the people, there is nothing that cannot be done anytime, anywhere, in any matter. The ancients also said, "Military affairs, punishment, finance, and grain can all be used to become Yao and Shun." Being a revolutionary leader is certainly a profession; being a small clerk is also a real profession, but it depends on what position you stand on and which direction you are working towards. As for the questions you raised, I will answer them here.</p>
<p>1.  The ugliness and baseness of human society are not absolute but relative: they are not immutable but change with the change of social systems. Your understanding of human society is completely emotional and short-sighted. Naturally, it is "one-sided." 2) The happiness and pain of life are also relative and mutually causal. For example, revolution is extremely painful, but seeking liberation and fighting for freedom in a bloodbath is happy. Corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats, sucking marrow and scraping bones, drinking and eating meat, having proud wives and beautiful concubines, or traitors who sell the country, warlords who harm the people, living in luxury, with gold and jade in front of them, are certainly happy, but one person is fat while the world is thin, one family laughs while the road cries, the people regard them as tyrants, and society hates them like enemies. The heart is uneasy at night, and the fate of being pointed at by thousands of people and dying without disease is inevitable sooner or later. Looking around, it is extremely painful. "To obtain happiness," there is no other way but to worry about what the majority worry about and be happy about what the majority are happy about. This is the standard for struggle. 3) The answer has been seen before, no more repetition.</p>

<p>Chapter Four: Business Conditions</p>
<h3 id="e145">Section Four: Old Doctors and Traditional Chinese Medicine <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Old doctors do not establish hospitals. All patients are treated in outpatient clinics or house calls. Therefore, when it comes to a few popular doctors, the number of patients they treat daily is often astonishing. For example, there is an old pediatrician in Shanghai who sees nearly one hundred patients every day. Each outpatient visit takes only three minutes. While taking the pulse, the students have already written the prescription. His business is so prosperous that the place is already crowded before dawn. Because he charges double for those who want to be seen first, an interesting thing happened. Many people take a child to see a doctor, pay two yuan to register early in the morning, and wait outside. If a child who arrives later has a more serious condition and is anxious to be seen first, they sell their number for three yuan. In this way, if their own child needs to see a doctor, they only spent one yuan. If they simply go home without seeing a doctor, they actually earn one yuan. So, a certain doctor's number has become a valuable security. The outside of his clinic has become an exchange. It can be considered a strange tale. And that doctor can truly be proud.</p>
<p>There is also a gynecology expert in the city who sees more than one hundred patients every day. Each prescription takes no more than three to five minutes. It is said that they can tell the sex of the fetus. I don't know if the statistics are accurate.</p>
<p>There is also a hereditary throat specialist who mostly uses diphtheria antitoxin and scarlet fever antitoxin. They also see about one hundred patients every day. I have personally seen them press the patient's tongue with their right hand to look at the throat while using their left hand to look at a boil on a child's head. And they are still shouting out the names of the medicines, ordering the students to write prescriptions. Meanwhile, several other students are giving antitoxin injections for them. However, the people waiting for treatment outside are still crowded. Therefore, there is an iron gate in his home to maintain order.</p>
<p>Some people think that the above situation is mysterious. In fact, it is only caused by people's excessive worship of experience, plus many blind followers. But naturally, some people in society do not agree with these hasty doctors. So, on the contrary, there are a few doctors who limit themselves to seeing twenty patients a day. No more after that. If you are late, you will not be seen. On the one hand, they raise their consultation fees several times to show the price of their day's mental concentration. Crossing the bridge and going beyond the boundary costs twenty or thirty yuan. They actually get the sympathy of society. Now, if we want to talk about the truth of old doctors' business, we cannot take the above people as representatives. The above is only about the business methods of these few people and their personal luck. As for the business development of most old doctors in general, we can still see it from the number of pharmacies. It can be said to be very developed. And the reason is that people's habits and knowledge are closer to old doctors and not close to new doctors. There is a very obvious example that can prove it. In my clinic, I still have one or two patients every month who do not know how to take new medicine. Often, I give them a prescription written from right to left, and they still ask, "Doctor, should I buy this prescription from a traditional Chinese medicine store and decoct it?" I must explain it to them again before they leave. With my limited business and the clear color of new medicine, and Shanghai being such an open city, there are still patients like this. This shows how deep the general public's concept of old medicine is, and on the other hand, it shows that the business of new medicine in the past has not penetrated the people. Then, the business of old medicine still occupies a large part. As for the so-called struggle mentioned above, it is still the struggle between old doctors and new doctors in the knowledge class.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Respectfully Informing the People of the Nation About Mr. Yu Ziwei's Will to Dissect the Remains (Part Two) Yu Yunxiu <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The second example is the younger sister of my good friend, Mr. Lin XX, who is about fifty years old this year. She has always been a spinster, serving her old mother, and is enthusiastic about education, sparing no effort. She is a very admirable lady. She originally had stomach problems, which increased last year. According to X-ray diagnosis and various clinical diagnoses, it was also stomach cancer. Later, she vomited very badly, and she said that the vomiting seemed to originate from her neck, not from her stomach. According to the doctor's examination, it seemed that there was a slight swelling in the neck, but they thought that the vomiting was caused by pyloric stenosis caused by stomach cancer, so they did not pay much attention to the swollen part. Later, it got worse and worse, and she was dying. Suddenly, a monk came and said that he had medicine to cure it. The method was to starve a cow for two days and then give it bitter Chinaberry root bark to chew. Many sticky saliva would come out of the cow's mouth. They took this saliva and poured it into the patient's mouth. Who knew that after one dose, she vomited a lot, vomiting out a lot of pus. From then on, although the vomiting did not stop completely, it improved a lot, and the person gradually became more active. So, it spread as a miracle in the countryside. Some said that a single remedy could kill famous doctors, and some said that the Buddha had manifested. Because Ms. Lin believed in Buddhism. There were different opinions. Not long after, I suddenly heard that she had passed away. I asked what disease she had died of. They said it was pneumonia, and it only took three days. When I heard about this, I always had a lot of questions. Later, when I met Dr. Chen XX, because he had treated her several times, I asked him in detail. He said, "The monk did cure the disease a lot, but I think that the patient's severe vomiting may have been caused by an abscess in the neck, which stimulated the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata. When the cow saliva was taken, the time for the abscess had matured, and it happened to coincide. After vomiting a lot, the abscess broke through in the throat and esophagus, and a lot of pus was discharged. After that, of course, food could also be swallowed, the stimulation was reduced, and the vomiting was alleviated. Naturally, the body gradually felt better. As for stomach cancer, I am afraid it has not been cured." I think this explanation is very reasonable. I also asked him, "Is it really true that she later died of pneumonia?" He said, "I don't know the details, but I heard that she died quickly." I said, "It only took three days after the onset of the disease. If it was pneumonia, it would definitely not be so rapid. Perhaps the stomach cancer has not been cured. Due to fatigue and other reasons, a sudden massive hemorrhage occurred. When a lot of blood came out, there would naturally be symptoms such as shortness of breath and wheezing. Others thought it was pneumonia, but it is also possible." Dr. Chen said, "Perhaps it was a stomach perforation that caused peritonitis." Dr. Chen and I discussed and ended it there. We can no longer do further research. I think in this case, if a pathological autopsy could be performed, all kinds of questions could naturally be solved easily. Even the myth of the Buddha manifesting could be eliminated. Now, without real evidence to prove it, this mystery will never be revealed. It really makes me feel depressed and regretful.</p>
<p>From the second fact, we can know that without a pathological autopsy, there will never be any progress in disease prevention and treatment. "To cure the disease, one must seek the root." This sentence has never been absent in our precious Chinese "Inner Canon." "Using medicine is like using soldiers, knowing yourself and your enemy, you will win every battle." This theory has often been read in our precious country's medical books, but saying it is just saying it, but no one has ever actually done the work of "seeking the root" and "knowing the enemy." It is not that we don't want to do it, but there is no way to actually do it. Of course, the equipment is not enough, but the first is that there is no pathological autopsy, so there is no way to think about it. We can only blindly say what the ancients said, regardless of three or seven twenty-one, and deeply believe in it. And we create the saying that ancient sages were "born knowing," thinking that people like Shennong and the Yellow Emperor had supernatural intelligence and could understand thoroughly without actually studying the human body, so what they said was not wrong at all. We later people are ordinary mortals and are only worthy of following what the ancients said, not worthy of doubting the ancients' words again. This kind of thinking is actually a dead end, so we have to use these words to comfort ourselves, deceive ourselves, and by doing so, we can stabilize society and secure our rice bowls. This whole performance was a temporary strategy thought of by cunning people. Who knew that it would be passed down from generation to generation, and a hundred or so fools would seriously take it as the truth, creating a religious-style medicine. From then on, the work of "seeking the root" and "knowing the enemy" was devoted to studying books. So, wind, fire, summer, dampness, Shaoyin, Taiyang, kidney deficiency, liver exuberance, were talked about in a colorful manner, but the actual situation was not mentioned at all. For example, kidney deficiency, where exactly is it deficient? Is it anemia, atrophy, tuberculosis, or tumor? We don't care about any of them. We only rely on symptoms such as thinness and weakness, sore waist and seminal emission, to conclude that it is kidney deficiency. We randomly use ginseng, Rehmannia and other medicines to treat kidney deficiency. For example, dampness, what exactly is the essence of dampness? Is it water? Is it mucus? Is it the result of inflammation seeping out? Or is it the result of circulatory disorders leaking out? We don't care about any of them. We only rely on symptoms such as heavy head, weak stomach, and lazy limbs to conclude that it is dampness. We randomly use Atractylodes, Pinellia, Poria and other medicines to strengthen the spleen and dispel dampness. This kind of method of diagnosing and treating diseases is completely empty in the final analysis. Where is there even a trace that is close to the actual disease? So, there is never a possibility of "seeking the root" and "knowing the enemy." In other words, we will never know the disease, and we will never know the real method of treating the disease. After modern scientific medicine came in, in order to struggle for the door and for the sake of "seeking the root" and "knowing the enemy," old doctors did not dare to say anything anymore. Because saying it would only expose their ugliness, expose their shortcomings, and destroy their foundations. So, they hid it so tightly that not a word leaked out, so that the general public could continue to be deceived. Furthermore, they would say ugly things and spread rumors about the pathological autopsy work of scientific medicine, saying that it was digging people's eyes and sucking people's blood, or that it was cruel, inhumane, and not close to human feelings. They did not welcome, promote, or imitate their own pathological autopsy work. Unexpectedly, they turned around and played out a series of jealous, mocking, and disruptive behaviors. It is really unprogressive and not good.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Scientific Research on Cleanliness (Continued) <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Renji</p>
<p>Scientific cleanliness is the foundation of health. There must be sufficient academic reasons. Relying only on shallow common sense based on customs and habits is not enough. In today's advanced medicine, all causes of health obstacles are clear. Today's cleanliness movement aims to eliminate causes harmful to health. Cleanliness is based on the foundation of etiology, with the goal of preventing disease. Therefore, it must be carried out. It is necessary to shift from subjectively perceived cleanliness to scientific cleanliness, and to study its uncleanness from a hygienic standpoint, divided into two types: chemical uncleanness and biological uncleanness.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Chemical Impurity <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Some people who apply powder to their faces suffer from lead poisoning. This is an example of chemical impurity. Drinking water containing lead causes poisoning. This water is chemically impure. Eating puffer fish and dying is also because the food contains chemical impurities. Also, food that is prone to spoilage contains harmful preservatives, such as beverages. These are all chemically impure and unclean. The air contains a harmful gas, carbon monoxide, which is also a type of chemical impurity. Clothing contains harmful pigments.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>It is also equally unclean. Anything that can cause poisoning can be considered a chemical impurity.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Biological Impurity <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Tapeworm larvae live in trout. People get sick from eating it. This trout is an unclean thing. Although the appearance of vegetables is clean, if their leaves are attached with roundworm eggs or typhoid fever bacteria, they should also be regarded as unclean objects. A small well is considered dangerous. Usually, its chemical composition is bad, which is harmful to the body. However, if typhoid bacteria are mixed in it, it is even more dangerous. It is not suitable for drinking if it is checked and found to contain ammonia. It is not that ammonia is a poisonous substance that cannot be used for drinking. The reason is that ammonia is mostly generated in toilets. Water containing this ingredient is feared to be connected to the toilet, so there is danger. The reason why the mixing of feces into water causes danger is that the danger does not belong to chemical danger. If the feces contain typhoid bacteria, dysentery bacteria, etc., these bacteria enter the mouth with the water, so there is danger. This is the so-called biological danger. However, boiling this dangerous well water for disinfection can ensure safety. And boiling water containing ammonia slightly will cause the ammonia to dissipate, so it can be reused.</p>
<p>The so-called biological impurity refers to the meaning of the danger of disease caused by the mixing of pathogenic bacteria and parasitic eggs. For example, the phlegm of patients with lung disease is dangerous because it contains tuberculosis bacteria. The phlegm of healthy people does not contain this bacteria, so it is not dangerous. Therefore, although the phlegm of healthy people is dirty, it is not dangerous. If the phlegm of patients with lung disease is boiled and sterilized once, although the appearance is dirty, it is still not dangerous. Although it is all phlegm, it is not biologically impure. The same is true for large and small stools. If the large and small stools of patients with infectious diseases are boiled and disinfected, they are not dangerous even if they enter the mouth. Although they are unclean and dirty in appearance, they do not affect human health. There is no need to pay too much attention to them. Although the appearance is not abnormal, from a scientific point of view, those who can be the cause of disease must be deeply vigilant. That is, the implementation of cleanliness needs to be scientific. What is the key to scientific cleanliness? It is said that if it is chemical, it is diluted. If it is biological, it should be disinfected. No matter how poisonous it is, it becomes harmless when diluted with water. No matter how dangerous it is, such as plague bacteria and cholera bacteria, the danger can also be eliminated by sterilization with heat or chemicals. It is essential to apply this scientific knowledge to seek thorough cleanliness.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Relief Methods for Farmers' Health <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Fubao</p>
<p>In recent years, farmers have been on the verge of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy leads to inadequate food and clothing. To talk to them about hygiene is quite difficult. Here, I will discuss the most economical and effective new methods of hygiene.</p>
<p>If one is partial to various types of animal foods, the body will inevitably become ill. This is because meat lacks vitamins, calcium, and carbohydrates. Furthermore, meat accumulates waste products from the animal and toxins resulting from animal diseases, as well as decomposition after slaughter. Therefore, those who exclusively eat meat must excrete large amounts of waste and toxins. Over time, the kidneys will become inflamed, and the liver and heart will also become diseased. Headaches, constipation, and mental fatigue will occur. Blood vessel walls will thicken, arteries will harden, and gout will develop throughout the body. Moreover, there is the risk of parasites in meat. If one is partial to various types of plant foods, the body will become increasingly healthy. This is because vegetables, fruits, rice, and wheat contain various vitamins, calcium, and carbohydrates. Also, vegetarians have the greatest endurance, and they recover more easily after illness. Digestion is also easier compared to meat. This is the theory of Dr. Miller from the United States. I have not eaten meat since the age of forty-five, and it has been sixteen years now. I feel that my body and mind are improving every day. I continue to handle daily tasks as usual and have never stopped working due to illness. Therefore, my first recommendation to farmers is to be vegetarian year-round, which can save a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>White rice lacks the second type of vitamin because the bran has been removed. As a result, it loses a great deal of nutrients. Eating it often leads to beriberi. Therefore, we should eat brown rice, which has not had the bran removed. Brown rice contains the most nutrients. Farmers are unaware of this principle and use the most valuable part of the food, the bran, to feed pigs, which is truly a pity. A certain Japanese doctor has been vigorously promoting the consumption of brown rice, stating that if one spends ninety yuan on white rice, one can spend only sixty yuan by switching to brown rice. According to this, we know that eating brown rice is not only rich in the second type of vitamin but can also save one-third of the cost of rice. Therefore, my second recommendation to farmers is to eat brown rice year-round, which can save a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>The new hygiene method of Mr. Fletcher from the United States advocates frugality in eating and chewing thoroughly, which is greatly beneficial for health. The method is as follows: Only eat when genuinely hungry, one. All food must be chewed carefully, until it is thoroughly broken down, and then swallowed, two. Focus the mind while eating, paying attention to the mouth, observing how it is being chewed, how it is mixing with saliva, and what flavors are emerging. In this way, there is sufficient saliva to stimulate the gastric glands, resulting in abundant gastric juices. This makes food easier to digest. Digestion leads to easy absorption. Absorption leads to a feeling of fullness, and one can stop eating. Stopping eating must be guided by the natural feeling of satisfaction. If one eats until the stomach is full and the abdomen is distended, feeling uncomfortable, it is truly inappropriate, three. By strictly adhering to the above three points, the necessary conditions for frugality in eating and chewing thoroughly are fully met. The remaining residue from digestion will naturally decrease, avoiding severe discomfort in the internal organs. Stool volume will sharply decrease and will not emit a foul odor. The accumulation of feces in the intestines will be reduced. The nutrients from the food consumed will be fully utilized. Therefore, the overall condition will improve day by day. This is a natural principle. Therefore, my third recommendation to farmers is to eat less and chew more year-round, which can save a significant amount of money.</p>
<p>Farmers should seek hygiene practices that are both economical and cost-free. The economical methods have already been mentioned above. The cost-free methods, such as deep breathing and sunbathing, will be discussed further below.</p>
<p>Deep breathing is a kind of exercise that transforms the body and mind. It has three major benefits. It can provide the lungs with appropriate exercise, fully exchange air during breathing, enhance the lungs' resistance, and maintain the lungs' permanent health or eliminate existing lung diseases, especially tuberculosis in the apex of the lungs, which can be eradicated, making it the greatest effect of deep breathing, one. It can improve blood circulation in the brain. During deep inhalation, the pressure inside the chest cavity decreases, causing blood from the brain substance to flow downward. During exhalation, the pressure inside the chest cavity increases, causing the downward-flowing blood to flow back. This action can prevent all cerebrovascular diseases (such as cerebral hemorrhage, commonly known as stroke, which causes the most rapid death), two. It can improve blood circulation in the abdominal cavity. During deep inhalation, the pressure exerted on the surface of the stomach, intestines, liver, spleen, kidneys, etc., by the abdominal wall causes blood in these areas to flow in all directions. During exhalation, the pressure is released, and the blood flows back from all directions. This action can improve blood circulation in the abdominal cavity. The nerves distributed in the abdomen are also strengthened by the same action. Therefore, the function of the internal organs in the abdomen is enhanced, and various diseases cannot arise, three. In summary, deep breathing is nothing less than an invisible Great Wall for our lifeline. The air we breathe fills the heavens and earth, is free of charge, and is inexhaustible. It is also something that everyone can enjoy.</p>
<p>Hygiene experts in various countries around the world have different methods for performing deep breathing. Based on my personal experience, alternating breathing through the nostrils is the most suitable. The method is to stand in an open space outside, exhale the air from the lungs through both nostrils, exhaling as much as possible. Then, use one finger to press one nostril closed and inhale through the other nostril as much as possible. Then, release the finger and slowly exhale. This is one repetition. After each repetition, walk sixty steps, stand still, and then perform the second repetition. Perform about twenty repetitions each time, walking a total of one thousand two hundred steps. This can be timed or considered as a full-body exercise. Perform this about four or five times a day to reap the various benefits of deep breathing. This alternating nostril breathing method involves deep and powerful inhalation, which has appropriate effects on the various functions mentioned above. Furthermore, because the inhalation through one nostril is relatively gentle, the pressure in the chest cavity does not decrease abruptly, and the blood in the brain substance can flow down to the chest cavity gradually, preventing the brain from experiencing a sudden state of anemia and causing dizziness.</p>
<h3 id="e151">A Visit to the Sino-French Pharmaceutical Factory <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Changhua</p>
<p>I have long admired the Sino-French Pharmaceutical Factory, as it has established a reputation throughout the country in just a few years. It must have remarkable achievements. I heard from a friend that the factory is one of the leading pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai. Its scale is rarely matched by other domestic companies in the industry. Recently, through a friend's introduction, I met Mr. Zhou Mengbai, the factory director, who is approachable and kind, and also one of the compilers of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. His works can often be seen in various domestic medical and pharmaceutical journals. He is a pharmaceutical expert. He kindly invited me to visit the factory the next morning. Therefore, my friend and I were able to go on time, fulfilling my long-cherished wish of many years. How delightful!</p>
<p>The factory is located west of the Great Western Road in the city, covering an area of more than ten acres. The front of the factory buildings is a two-story Chinese-style building. The director's office and the general affairs department are located there. Workers eat and live there, and some of the factory's products are also stored there. (It is said that most of them are transported daily by the factory's own trucks to the main store, and then shipped to various places.) Further inside is a new-style three-story Western-style building made of steel and reinforced concrete. It is where the essence of the entire factory is concentrated. Most of the ground floor is used as a machine workshop, with seven or eight rooms. I will describe them separately below.</p>
<p>1.  In the pill-making room, there are twelve pill-making machines. Each machine can produce about forty catties per day. There are also two powder-mixing machines, which are dedicated to mixing powders for pill-making. The machines are powered by motors, and the raw materials for the pills are purely Chinese medicine. The Lung Hu Brand Rendan, which we often take, and the newly advertised Xin Hong Dan, Lao Hong Dan, and Yin Dan, are all made there.</p>
<p>2.  In the polishing room, there are four polishing machines. This is the final step in the production of Rendan. It is said that the cinnabar used for the coating of the Rendan is Guangdong cinnabar, so its luster is different from that of those who use Japanese cinnabar. This shows the factory's determination to use domestic products.</p>
<p>3.  In the tablet-making room, there are two tablet-making machines, which are dedicated to making various tablets, such as Aspirin tablets, Cascara tablets, Happy Baby tablets, and Quinine tablets, totaling dozens of types. When we visited, the machine was pressing Luo Wei Aspirin tablets, which were accurately dosed and beautifully white, no wonder everyone likes to use them.</p>
<p>4.  In the powder-making room, there are four powder-making machines, which are dedicated to grinding various powders, such as licorice, rhubarb, cinnamon, and cloves. The factory makes all powdered medicines itself. One of them is a Caites Integrator, which is also driven by a motor. It can compress large pieces into small pieces and crush coarse powder into fine powder, producing very quickly. The factory is also adding more powder-making machines because the current ones are insufficient, so the future output will be even more impressive.</p>
<p>5.  In the drying room, there is a vacuum drying machine, which is very large. Next to it is a new-style air pump, and there are iron pipes to connect them. It is said that all medicines that cannot be dried with high heat can be dried in this machine. Next to the machine is another room with steam pipes, which uses the residual heat from the steam to dry various medicines. The room is also equipped with a temperature regulator and an electric fan, which can be said to be fully equipped.</p>
<p>6.  In the sugar-coating room, there are two sugar-coating machines. The machines are round and have a warm exterior. There are fans on the side to regulate the heat and the evaporation of moisture. It is said that the accurately-dosed Elephant Brand sugar-coated Quinine tablets currently on the market are made there.</p>
<p>7.  In the bottle-washing room, because the factory produces too many types of products, and the bottles are of different shapes and sizes, this washing work does not use machines, but uses manual labor. In addition to various washing devices, the room also has a steam drying oven and a steam disinfection oven. The bottles must be disinfected and dried after washing before they can be used. I always knew that the bottle-washing area was the most difficult to keep clean. Now that the factory pays attention to this, it is truly commendable.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also box-dressing rooms and powder-mixing rooms, etc. I was unable to observe them in detail, so I cannot describe them fully here. I will only note their names.</p>
<p>On the second floor is the manufacturing department, headed by pharmacist Lin Hongzao. All manufacturing matters in the factory are managed by this department, which includes the raw material stock, warehouse, formulation, and packaging sections. There is also a research laboratory for inspection or research purposes. That day, we saw that a medicine was being tested in the laboratory to see if it complied with pharmacopoeia regulations. Mr. Zhou said that recently, due to price competition, drug dealers often disregard ethics and engage in counterfeiting. Even a certain foreign-owned pharmacy on Nanjing Road has been found to be counterfeiting, which is regrettable. In terms of manufacturing, we saw the preparation of Ai Luo Brain Tonic, 914 Ointment, and other large quantities of medicines. These are handled in separate rooms to specialize in their respective tasks, as described below.</p>
<p>8.  In the decoction room, there are two boiling machines, one pressure steaming machine, one heating and mixing machine, and one cold mixing machine. Brain tonic is made here. It is said that the work is busiest between autumn and winter, because in addition to brain tonic, Luo Wei Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil and Baby Cream must also be produced in large quantities to meet market demand.</p>
<p>9.  In the distillation room, there are three distillation machines, one of which is dedicated to producing large quantities of distilled water. All water used in the factory for formulation is this water. The water is also supplied to the chemistry laboratories of several universities, such as Guanghua and Fudan, because it is pure and inexpensive. When we visited, we saw that one of the machines was distilling almond water. I know that most almond water on the market is made simply by adding almond oil to water, but this factory is able to manufacture it according to regulations, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>10. In the maceration room, there are more than ten of the latest percolation devices and several pressing filters. All extracts, fluid extracts, and tinctures, etc., in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and other national pharmacopoeias are manufactured here. It is said that the filters are very sophisticated, as they can quickly filter large quantities of products and filter substances that cannot be filtered by ordinary methods. For example, the factory's Emergency Epidemic Water is filtered using this machine, and it is said that the daily filtration volume can reach more than four thousand pounds.</p>
<p>11. In the oil-making room, various ointments are manufactured. The aforementioned 914 Ointment is made here. It is said that an average of one thousand dozen can be produced.</p>
<p>12. In the capsule room, various soft capsules are made, such as cod liver oil. When we visited, they were making 914 white cloudy medicine. Although there are many white cloudy medicines on the market, most of them are probably imported products repackaged or inferior goods disguised as the real thing. Now that the factory can manufacture it itself, it is truly admirable. It is also said that the formula is prepared according to the latest theories, so it has only been on the market for less than two years, and it has already been sold throughout the country, recovering rights and interests, not a small amount.</p>
<p>The above are all related to the formulation aspect.</p>
<p>Above, most of the space is used for paper box storage, and a small part is used for packaging. This room is dedicated to the packaging of large quantities of medicines. There are about sixty female workers, and their work is very efficient. To the left of the Western-style building is a row of Western-style buildings. The packaging section is also located on the upper floor. All individual items are placed there for packaging. The number of female workers is similar to that on the third floor. The ground floor is used to store raw materials. There is also a boiler room, located on the right side of the Western-style building. The boiler is not very large. It is said that it burns at most one ton of coal per day, but this is because the factory's power is purely electric, and the boiler's steam is only used for heating.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an eastern factory, which was newly expanded last year due to insufficient factory space. There is a row of flat tin buildings, covering an area of more than one acre, which serves as a warehouse for storing various glass bottles. There are also sixteen newly built flat rooms, including a mosquito coil manufacturing area, a pill-selection room, an ash-drying room, and a Rendan packaging room. It is said that the raw materials for manufacturing mosquito coils in the factory are also purely domestic products, such as pyrethrum, which are currently collected from Wuxi, Nantong, and other places. It is said that if domestic raw materials are not available, they would rather temporarily stop production. There are more than eighty female workers in the Rendan packaging room. This room can produce more than one hundred thousand five-fen packs of Rendan every day and night. It is said that this domestic Rendan was not originally manufactured there. Since Mr. Zhou took over, he has made significant improvements, so the recent products have improved a lot compared to before. It is believed that the people will definitely support it.</p>
<p>Overall, all parts of the factory are well-organized and have a thriving atmosphere. Although many foreign patent medicines are flooding the country, the factory only resists one-tenth of them. However, since the publication of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, because Mr. Zhou is involved in the compilation of the Pharmacopoeia, the pharmacopoeial preparations he manufactures are all made according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, taking the lead in advocating their use. The raw materials also often undergo small-scale trials, which are all sufficient to show Mr. Zhou's efforts to develop China's pharmaceutical industry, not only to resist foreign goods but also to contribute to the people's livelihood. To save the country through industry, I have high hopes for Mr. Zhou.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Secondary School Graduation Entrance Examination Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 2nd at the Department of Education. More than 20 committee members including Shi Naikang and Chen Tianou attended. The meeting was chaired by Department Head Zhou. He reported that the purpose of holding the entrance examination was to comply with national policies on the one hand, and to consider the difficulties of young people on the other. After considering both aspects, a decision was made on the entrance examination guidelines. The selection of committee members was based on academic qualifications, economic status, and reputation, and they were selected from various schools in the province, but they did not represent any one school, but represented the entire education community of the province. It was hoped that all committee members would maintain a detached attitude and conduct a fair review. The meeting then resolved many examination matters, including the experimental methods. For example, Party Principles, Chinese Language, History, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology all used answers. English, Geography, and Testing used both testing and answers. Chinese Language had one essay question. English had one essay question, two question-and-answer questions, and ten sentence questions. Geography had ten testing questions and two essay questions. For other subjects, select four questions to answer. No additional questions may be answered beyond the specified question types for each subject. All examination questions will be written in classical Chinese, but scientific names should be noted with their original Western names. In addition, examination hall rules and examination timetables were also separately established. The following is an excerpt for the information of candidates.</p>

<p>Suzhou Elementary School Joint Association Opposes Elementary School Entrance Examination</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued orders for graduation entrance examinations for primary and secondary schools, which are bound to be implemented. However, the previous time, the Hunan Department of Education, due to special local circumstances, submitted a report to the Ministry of Education for some flexibility. Although the Ministry of Education stated that the matter was a misunderstanding of rumors, middle school students in various places have requested exemptions from examinations, and the Department of Education has had many difficulties in dealing with them. The Ministry of Education has requested instructions on how to proceed. The Ministry of Education replied to Fujian and other provinces yesterday that the middle school entrance examination is bound to be implemented, and it is hoped that the previous orders will be followed.</p>
<p>Private secondary school principals in Nanjing have repeatedly appealed for the entrance examination. The Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has stipulated methods for holding the examinations in different districts. Although students want to be exempt from examinations, it is difficult to graduate without an entrance examination and there is nowhere to go for further education. In the end, they must take the examination.</p>
<p>However, the Beijing City area is actively conducting elementary school entrance examinations. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has notified various municipal schools to report the number of students graduating in the current year. It is said that some schools first consider the students' level and select the best ones to report (for example, if there are 30 sixth-grade students who are supposed to graduate this year, those with low abilities will be excluded, because the entrance examination has many failures, which are considered to be a standard for assessing the principal's performance. Therefore, everyone is in danger of losing their jobs and must plan ahead). On the one hand, teaching is being stepped up (some schools have temporarily revised their regular schedules for sixth-grade students, requiring them to come early and leave late, and even to attend school on Sundays). Subjects have been changed (some schools only teach Chinese, Arithmetic, and Social Studies to sixth-grade students every day, and no other subjects). As a result, teachers are overworked and students suffer (elementary school students' bodies are not fully developed, and their homework is increased in vain, and dreaming of the entrance examination every day is harmful to their health). This is definitely not good for the future of elementary school education. The graduating students of each school are reporting fewer students, which inevitably leads to family blame for those who have not graduated. To avoid questioning, the graduation examination problems held earlier in the school raise the standard, so as to avoid excuses. This matter is indeed an important issue for elementary schools, and it is not known how it will turn out.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Elementary School Federation issued a declaration yesterday opposing the elementary school entrance examination, stating that holding graduation entrance examinations for elementary schools hinders the physical and mental development of children and is not in line with educational principles, arousing sympathy from the educational community.</p>

<p>Tao Xuan, the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Women's Middle School, is also a member of the Legislative Yuan. Tao has decided to resign as principal of the Women's Middle School to focus on her work as a member of the Legislative Yuan, as it is too strenuous to handle both positions. It is heard that the most hopeful candidates to succeed her are Qian Yonghe, Ni Liang, and Zhu Guangyu, all of whom have served as principals of the Xuzhou Women's Normal School (Qian, Ni, and Zhu have all served as principals of the Third Women's Normal School in Xuzhou).</p>

<p>In addition to Wang Jihuai setting a new Games record in the long jump (the previous highest Games record of 6.49 meters was also set by Mr. Wang, and now he has broken his own record with 6.705 meters), our Chinese athletes also set new national records in the 400-meter and 1600-meter relays, which is the greatest achievement for our athletes. It is noted that the previous highest national record for the 400-meter relay was 46.6 seconds, set by the Beijing team at the 15th North China Games in Jinan in 1931. Now, Huang Feilong, Dong Yinchu, Wang Jihuai, and Cheng Jinguan have broken it with 46 seconds. The previous highest national record for the 1600-meter relay was 3 minutes and 41.4 seconds, also set by the Liaoning team at the 15th North China Games in Jinan. Now, Zeng Rongzhong, He Debao, Dong Shuzhao, and Guan Changfa have broken it with 3 minutes and 41 seconds. However, although new national records were set, they did not break the Games records. The comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>400-Meter Relay 1600-Meter Relay</p>
<p>Our Original Record 46.6 seconds 3 minutes 41.4 seconds</p>

<p>The results of this competition are quite satisfactory. Over the two days, male and female athletes set six new Games records in total, with each gender accounting for three. The time of 52 seconds in the men's 400 meters tied the record. The list is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Shot Put</p>
<p>Mironov's last push turned the tide. The preliminary three throws were almost dominated by the Chinese, occupying the top three positions. Gong Wanyu led with 12.13 meters, Leng Peigen was second with 11.89 meters, and Chen Baoqiu was third with 11.72 meters. Then came the Englishman McFee and Parker. The defending champion, Mironov, was in between McFee and Parker, ranking fifth with a score of 11.44 meters. It was thought that there would be no surprises. Who knew that Mironov's final sixth throw would be extraordinary, improving by more than one meter, allowing him to suddenly surge ahead? The results are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Motovkin (Russia) 12.44 meters</p>
<p>Second: Gong Wanyu (China) 12.13 meters</p>
<p>Third: Leng Peigen (China) 11.895 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Chen Baoqiu (China) 11.795 meters</p>
<p>Fifth: McFee (England) 11.52 meters</p>
<p>Sixth: Parker (Germany) 11.33 meters</p>
<p>(2) Pole Vault</p>
<p>Chen Ling struggles to defeat his opponents. Yesterday's pole vault took more than two hours, a real hard battle. At first, it was thought that the Japanese might have good athletes, but unexpectedly, Hirato was eliminated after three jumps. Veteran Schwanck was fourth, and Chu Yinghuang was eliminated in third place with 3.26 meters. Chen Ling and Cao Yu fought hard, making it difficult to separate them. They both cleared 3.335 meters and then both fell. After adding back and forth, they went back to 3.26 meters. Both cleared it again and then fell. At this point, the two were exhausted. Cao fell, and Chen Ling was victorious. It can be called a hard-won battle.</p>
<p>First: Chen Ling 3.335 meters</p>
<p>Second: Cao Yu 3.335 meters</p>
<p>Third: Chu Yinghuang 3.26 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Schwanck Unmeasured</p>
<p>(3) Javelin Throw</p>
<p>Hertson's specialty. There were many good athletes in the javelin throw, but the American was definitely going to be first. Wang Jihuai abandoned his attempt after knowing his thoughts were in vain after one throw. Hertson's first throw was 45.47 meters, securely taking the lead. The results of the four athletes are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Hertson (USA) 45.47 meters</p>
<p>Second: Mower (USA) 41.95 meters</p>
<p>Third: Yang Fang (China) 40.30 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Mironov (Russia) 39.76 meters</p>
<p>(4) Triple Jump</p>
<p>Komatsu retains the championship. Last year's champion, Komatsu from Japan, broke his own record of 13.245 meters with 13.35 meters, retaining the championship. His last jump was powerful and impressive, truly a family tradition. A small red flag measured the steps accurately. The second was also a Japanese athlete. Our Wang Yongmin and He Zuxi were third and fourth. The results of the four athletes are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Komatsu (Japan) 13.35 meters (New)</p>
<p>Second: Oka (Japan) 13.295 meters (New)</p>
<p>Third: Wang Yongmin (China) 13.06 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: He Zuxi (China) 13.04 meters</p>
<p>(5) Women's Javelin</p>
<p>Bennett shines again. There were only five participants, three of whom were Chinese women, one being the beautiful Ms. Bennett and one being the Englishwoman Thompson. Thompson had not practiced this event and only managed a few meters. Two of her javelins were broken. Bennett could run and jump, but who knew she could also throw the javelin? When throwing the javelin, she had great momentum. The javelin flew like an arrow. Her first throw was 26.285 meters, not only setting a new Games record but also breaking the Chinese record of 24.20 meters. Chen Rongming was second with 23.63 meters, which was satisfactory. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Bennett (USA) 26.285 meters</p>
<p>Second: Chen Rongming (China) 23.63 meters</p>
<p>Third: Huang Shuhua (China) 23.45 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Zhuang Quanzhao (China) 18.11 meters</p>

<p>(1) 100 Meters Yellash's Victory Not Easy</p>
<p>The first event of the finals in the drizzling rain was the men's 100 meters. With six people of equal strength, a fierce battle was expected. After the start, Cheng Jinguan took the lead, Tang Sly refused to be outdone, and the short Dongyang (Oka) tried his best to catch up. Yellash was in fourth place. In an instant, with only 30 meters remaining, Yellash chased hard with flying strides and full of vigor. At the finish line, Yellash had chased to the front and won by a shoulder. It was also quite dangerous. Time: 11.4 seconds. Cheng was second, Tang third, and Oka fourth. Huang Feilong and Monahan were eliminated.</p>
<p>(2) Women's 50 Meters Has Fierce Battle</p>
<p>American Thompson's women's ten are the highest record holders with seven seconds.</p>
<p>In the preliminary round, Ms. Bennett overwhelmed her. Yesterday's final was intended to avenge the previous hatred, but things went against her. Although she fought fiercely, she lost to Bennett again by one meter. The time was 7.2 seconds. Qian Xingsu tried hard to catch up and won third place, which was also gratifying.</p>
<p>(3) High Hurdles Chen Ling Suffers Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>Contrary to general expectations, the veteran Chen Ling could have won the championship, but unexpectedly, he encountered an opponent. In the first five hurdles, Chen Ling's strides were relaxed and extremely smooth. The little mustache Parker followed closely behind him without any reluctance. After the first five hurdles, the two were running shoulder to shoulder, holding on without giving way. The steps were even and the posture was beautiful. Even at the last hurdle, they were still on the balance line, but when Parker landed after clearing the hurdle, he took the lead and won the championship. Chen Ling's foot strength weakened slightly, leading to the lag, but they were only half a step apart. The time was 17.1 seconds, an improvement over the preliminary round. Guo Zhixin was third, and Mironov was fourth.</p>
<p>(4) Women's 100 Meters Still Belongs to Bennett</p>
<p>The situation in the women's 100-meter final was similar to that of the 50 meters. Thompson was again one meter behind and finished second. Ms. Bennett won another championship. The time was 13.5 seconds. The American Bauer was third, and Qian Xingsu勉强managed to get fourth place.</p>

<p>(5) Four People Compete in the 400 Meters</p>
<p>There were four Chinese in the 400-meter final, but before the race, Unknown Changfa and He De gave up the race. Only Sheppard, Zeng Rongzhong, Dengler, and Liu Fukang competed. After the start, Zeng was third, Sheppard sprinted ahead with excellent skill. After 200 meters, Zeng Rong surpassed Dengler, who chased Sheppard without success. Liu Fukang was far behind. The time was 52 seconds, tying Iger's highest Games record.</p>
<p>(6) 10,000 Meters The Situation is Tense</p>
<p>The 10,000-meter final was one of the most exciting scenes of yesterday. Eighteen people competed, and twelve finished the race. The Chinese Wang Zhenglin, the Russian Livkin Valley, the French Glatt, and the British Craig fiercely contested all the way. From beginning to end, the four were inseparable, sometimes ahead and sometimes behind, without giving any ground. Therefore, the situation was particularly tense, and the competition was even more exciting. The audience applauded warmly. When there was only one lap left, Wang Zhenglin opened up his stride and stood out from the crowd. His attitude was natural, his steps were beautiful, and he was leading by 15 yards. The applause from the audience became even more enthusiastic, and the whole venue was excited, thinking that he could win the championship. Unexpectedly, with only 100 meters remaining, the Russian Livkin Valley, encouraged by people running alongside him, struggled to accelerate and finally overtook Wang Zhenglin to win the championship. At the same time, the French Glatt Mrs. Tan Zhisheng Awarded the Prize (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<p>jumped up, Wang Zhenglin felt that his speed had decreased, so he was also overtaken. Mr. Jun suffered a crushing defeat and was very sorry. The British Craig was fourth. The time was 35 minutes 28.8 seconds. When Livkin Valley was only 100 meters away, the Russians on the sidelines ran alongside to cheer him on. This is not allowed according to the regulations. Chief Referee Shen Siliang stepped forward to stop him to no avail. Although Livkin Valley won the championship, his qualification should have been canceled. Afterwards, the Chinese team management did not file a protest, which can be said to be extremely negligent. If Livkin Valley had not had assistance from the side, the championship seat might still have belonged to Wang Zhenglin, and Glatt might not have been able to catch up either. The names of the twelve athletes are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Livkin Valley (Russia) (7) Ir of Xu (Russia)</p>
<p>(2) Glatt (France) (8) Xu Yan (China)</p>
<p>(3) Wang Zhenglin (China) (9) Chen Xuzhou (China)</p>
<p>(4) Craig (England) (10) Lu Bingsheng (England)</p>
<p>(5) Jin Zhongkang (China) (10) (1) Clark (England)</p>
<p>(6) Bowman (England) (10) (2) Xiang Ying (Russia)</p>
<p>(7) 1600-Meter Relay Sets New Record</p>
<p>In the 1600-meter relay, the Chinese team set a new national record again with a time of 3 minutes 41 seconds, breaking the Liaoning team's national record of 3 minutes 41.6 seconds set at the 15th North China Games in Jinan. In this race, the strength of the American, Japanese, and French teams faded. Zeng Rongzhong of our country once again went to take the baton. The American general Seves chased after He Debao of our country, who led the charge. The situation was quite dangerous. Fortunately, they were not far apart when it came to the third leg. Dong Shuzhao took the baton and charged ahead, and China once again took the lead. In the final leg, the American hesitated when taking the baton, and Guan Changfa of China was already far ahead, so he won first place. The United States was second, Japan was third, and France was fourth. When France took the fourth leg, a French bystander told him to give up the run to avoid embarrassment, but this person insisted on finishing the whole course. As a result, although he came in fourth, he was also a fun event with two extra points. The lineups of the Chinese and American teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Team (1) Zeng Rongzhong (2) He Debao (3) Dong Shuzhao (4) Guan Changfa American Team (1) Bartholomew (2) Seves (3) Brelich (4) Dengler</p>
<p>(8) Cheng Jinguan Has Merit in the 200 Meters</p>
<p>In the 200-meter preliminary round, the Chinese Cheng Jinguan thought he could only get third place and could not beat Sheppard and Yellash, but as a result, Sheppard indeed got first place without a doubt, but Cheng Jinguan was able to beat Yellash and get second place, which was gratifying. The fourth was the Chinese Dong Yinchu. The time was 23.4 seconds.</p>
<p>(9) Tao Yingjie Wins the Medium Hurdles Championship</p>
<p>Tao Yingjie led all the way and secured the championship with a time of 61 seconds. Chen Ling was shoulder to shoulder with Tao at first, but his foot strength gradually weakened later and he was overtaken by Mironov. Da Mao Sun Huipei tripped over the last hurdle, but fortunately, the pursuers finally won fourth place.</p>
<p>(10) Seves is Fierce in the 800 Meters</p>
<p>In the 800-meter final, the American general Seves was extremely skilled and unmatched by others. He won the championship with 2 minutes 7.8 seconds. In the first lap, Li Yanxiang was in second place, but was surpassed by Dong Shuzhao. However, he failed to catch up with Se Unknown. In the last 100 meters, Li Yanxiang and Hou Derui were also surpassed by the British Litt and Brelich, and Dong Shuzhao was also overtaken by Litt. Dong fell to third place, and Brelich was fourth.</p>
<p>(11) Chinese Suffers Crushing Defeat in the 800-Meter Relay</p>
<p>After failing in the 400-meter and 1600-meter relays, the United States tried to retaliate in the final 800-meter relay. Because their personnel were average and they were always in the lead, China fought hard but lost, trailing by ten yards. The time was 1 minute 38 seconds. England was third, and Japan was fourth. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Country First Leg Second Leg Third Leg Fourth Leg</p>
<p>(1) USA Hall Monahan Larilifu Yellash</p>
<p>(2) China Chen Baoqiu Dong Yinchu Wang Jihuai Cheng Jinguan</p>
<p>(3) England McGarth Rubin Sheng Wukefu She Unknown Te</p>
<p>(4) Japan Okamoto Miyagi Tagawa Tawara</p>

<p>Over two hundred veteran athletes participated in this competition, with the oldest being Mr. Xu from the British team, whose age is nearing sixty. He is very enthusiastic about protecting the athletes in the long jump and javelin events. During these two competitions, Mr. Wei roamed beside the jumping track, showing concern and warmth, his attentiveness evident to all.</p>
<p>For the white,</p>
<p>the English,</p>
<p>identity.</p>
<p>Where's my little parasol? The weather played tricks. Yesterday morning, light rain fell intermittently. At noon, an hour before the competition began, the plum rain returned, causing everyone to sit on the stands, watching the proceedings, shrinking in discomfort. Only a disciple took out a parasol and watched calmly as ever. A red-clad woman on the west stand had brought a pink parasol, but upon arrival, the parasol vanished like a crane gone to heaven, her anxiety increasing. "Where's my little parasol?" she cried, her voice as clear as a lark's. Everyone turned to look.</p>
<p>Felt blanket as a tent. American athlete Miss White Byrd always carries a gray felt blanket with her when she enters the arena, to use as a wrap for her legs during rest. In the finals of the 100-meter and 50-meter races, the rain was heavy and dense. Miss White's jersey was soaked and clung to her. Yela Xu Thongsley, as a comforting gesture, quickly used White's blanket to shelter her. Misses Bauer Tortain and Er also came seeking shelter, like little birds seeking refuge.</p>
<p>My sister said it's not very effective. Since Zhuang Mingjie retired from the army and Zhang Pingxian graduated and returned to the fields, the Chinese women's team has suffered a decline, feeling like "a general gone, the great wall crumbling." The high jump, long jump, short-distance running, and relay events were all dominated by the American girls, causing a feeling of oppression. Fortunately, Dongya's sister, Qian Hangsu, still strives to improve, securing positions in both short-distance races. When Miss Qian went to the podium to receive her award, someone congratulated her, saying, "You're very good." She shook her head slightly and said, "I'm not very effective," expressing a deep sense of regret.</p>
<p>I wish I could give him a push. The 10,000-meter race began with light rain and a gentle breeze, the air extremely solemn. The athletes were all in high spirits, methodically embarking on a long-distance struggle. By the 5,000-meter mark, the skinny monkey Wang Zhengling from Germany was vying for the lead with the two heroes, Lofkin and Qiladi, drawing cheers from the entire stadium. In the final lap, Wang unfortunately grew impatient and increased his speed too early, allowing Laqi and the others to overtake him about twenty meters from the finish line. Several female spectators in the stands gnashed their teeth and said to each other, "I wish I could give him a push," as the skinny monkey had exhausted his strength and could not make a final sprint.</p>
<p>Damn, it's too slippery. As various competitions were in full swing, the Etton Road Patrol House added a special "tug-of-war" performance, with thirty people divided into teams A and B. They stood in a line, pulling a thick rope. The team leaders shouted loudly, "Hang on!" "Pull!" The crowd echoed in response, their voices reaching the clouds. Each side exerted all their strength, straining their backs and sticking out their behinds, glaring with bulging eyes and raised eyebrows, pulling relentlessly. As a result, Team B was declared defeated because they crossed the center line twice. Their leader, a burly Shandong man, proudly said to the people, "Damn, it's too slippery." The implication, of course, was "If it weren't slippery, how could we have lost?"</p>

<p>The Manila Tung Wah soccer team won again today, defeating St. Peter's University by a score of 2-0. Chen Qingju was absent due to illness, but the Tung Wah team remained strong. The ball was often in the opponents' territory, and they scored two consecutive goals in the second half. Their next match will be against the Fiji All-Stars team. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<p>| 4 PM this afternoon at Aurora Stadium</p>
<p>Deputy Head Reports Important Matters in Shanghai</p>
<p>Expedition to Hankou Postponed to Next Week</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army Youth Military Service Corps, which departed from Guangzhou to participate in the war zone work, has sent the following recent news:</p>
<p>Battle Aurora Today - The Corps' soccer team has been in Shanghai for several days and has performed well in friendly matches with Fudan. The team has now rescheduled its friendly match against the Aurora Alumni Soccer Team for 4 PM today (originally yesterday) at the Aurora School Stadium. The lineup will be the same as in the match against Fudan. The team has coordinated their attacks, and their performance should be better than before. The Aurora Alumni Team has Western and local stars, so it is difficult to predict the outcome.</p>
<p>19th Route Army Lineup</p>
<p>Lin Dacheng, Tang Yaokun, Yang Guohua, Yang Benhan, Xu Yaoxian, Liang Darong, Huang Meishun, Jiang Shanjing, You Huaxing, Yong Sen, Zheng Shaokang</p>

<p>Zhang Susheng, Kang Shouming, Mao Hanxing, Pan Zicheng, Wang Baoliang, Ke Laituo, Wu Hengyu, Zhu Zhaxi, Cai Wenyi, Hua Laibao, Shuai Lang Que Li, Xu Ximan</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai to Discuss the Situation - Deputy Head Zheng Jiannan, on behalf of the First Column Leader Zhang Yan, traveled from Chen County, southern Hunan, via Hankou to Shanghai to discuss important matters with Head Jin. According to Mr. Zheng, the northward-bound troops were warmly welcomed by the people along the way, who donated a large number of comfort items. Chairman He of Hunan also sent officials to care for them along the way. As for the Youth Service Corps, every time they arrived in a city or town, they carried out various propaganda activities to awaken the people's resistance against Japan. They performed patriotic dramas in Rongchang, Yizhang, and other places. Although the Dayu Mountains and Jiufeng Mountains on the border between Hunan and Guangdong were high and dangerous, they showed no fear and marched forward, following the troops over the mountains for five consecutive days without feeling any pain, which showed the anti-Japanese enthusiasm of all the members. When the team arrived in Chenzhou, hundreds of local male and female students, willing to pay their own expenses, requested to join the team. The first batch of team members has already reached Hengzhou and Xiangtan to spread propaganda and screen films on the history of the 19th Route Army in the Shanghai Battle and their lives along the way north. The people of Hunan Province are very concerned about the anti-Japanese war effort, which shows that the hearts of the people are not dead and there is still hope for the future of the nation. It is said that Mr. Zheng will take a plane back to the troops to preside over the corps' affairs after the official matters are properly handled.</p>
<p>Expedition to Hankou to Be Postponed - The soccer team originally planned to take a boat to Hankou today, but due to the continuous bad weather and the fact that the second batch of players will arrive in Shanghai during the day, the expedition has been postponed to next week. It is expected that five matches will be played in Hankou, which have been properly arranged by the Hubei Provincial Sports Committee and the Youth Association, Mr. Song Ruhai.</p>

<h3 id="e174">The Northern Journey <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>Several years ago, I also took the Pingpu Railway train to visit the northern metropolis. Although yellow dust flew even during the day, filling my nose, this is my home, my motherland, I love it, I love it deeply, a nostalgic impression that is still very clear in my mind.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army's cannons broke through Shanhaiguan, the Blue Sky White Sun flag outside Shanhaiguan was buried; when the Japanese army's stray bullets from airplanes broke the Great Wall, the Manchurian flag with the yellow dragon and red sun replaced it outside the Great Wall; needless to say, if I have the opportunity to go north again, I want to go to Liaoning, Jilin, Rehe, Heilongjiang to see the vast forests, the towering snow mountains, and the vast ice rivers. Can I not obtain a travel permit from a certain country and say that I am going abroad?</p>
<p>I remember that during the period when a part of the National Army was fighting with the barbaric nation inside and outside the Great Wall, many young people went north to kill the enemy, followed by members of the Red Cross, who went north to rescue the wounded, followed by young ladies who brought biscuits and cigarettes to comfort the troops. Also, a large number of broadswords were manufactured and transported north to supply the enemy-killing efforts. During the period from September 18th to the recent armistice, in fact, there were also Central Army troops going north, Minister Song going north, Minister He going north, and even Chairman Chiang going north. Most recently, there was Chairman Huang Fu going north. Of course, we don't include those in the rear who, from some military and civilian organizations, sent telegrams saying they were going north, but were slow to act.</p>
<p>After all, Chairman Huang Fu's northern journey revealed a glimmer of hope for peace! We cannot but express our admiration and gratitude for the loftiness of this northern journey and the efforts to win honor for the country after going north. As for myself, living peacefully in Shanghai, writing Chinese characters, reading Chinese newspapers, and being considered a Chinese citizen on the household register, what reason do I have not to salute the angel of peace!</p>
<p>Even though I still have many brothers and sisters drifting in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe; no, they are drifting abroad, they have not given me any news so far, perhaps they have been killed?</p>
<p>However, history tells us that a nation that does not resist deserves to be killed. From this point of view, what is there to complain about? Although, even though, perhaps, as a result of Chairman Huang Fu's efforts to negotiate under the four non-conditions (no loss of sovereignty, no humiliation of the country, no surrender, no compromise), the barbaric nation will return our lost territories, and at that time, the Blue Sky White Sun flag will once again fly over the forests, the snow mountains, and the ice rivers; then my compatriots who are now detained abroad will be returned to the Republic of China to be citizens! Needless to say: if we really have the opportunity to go north to see the ruins of the battlefield, we will neither have the trouble of obtaining a travel permit from a certain country, nor will we have the strength to say such a beautiful name: "Going abroad"?</p>

<p>Mythical novels have become a distorted gift for Chinese children, so bank apprentices go to Mount Emei to seek immortals without saying goodbye, and 14-year-old elementary school students abandon their families and go to Wudang Mountain to visit Taoists. One scene after another is constantly being staged. After the national crisis began, the children's thoughts changed greatly, and they all hid at home, thinking about turning the gourd on the wall and the milk bottle on the table into magic treasures so as to scatter beans into soldiers and avenge the country. This is really a great success of Chinese education. One child suddenly saw a misty smoke outside the window, looking like auspicious clouds, and his heart suddenly blossomed. He jumped out of the window. But this child was not very skilled after all, and did not have the skills of Sun Wukong or Zhu Bajie. In the end, he could not jump out of the natural law of gravity and fell on a wonton stall under the building window. Although this is a joke, the inconceivable of Monk Jigong is still worshipped by everyone, who wishes to be Li Nezha or Tu Xingsun first.</p>
<p>I have a dear friend who observes his nose with his eyes and his mind with his nose, sits quietly, and after a long time, below the navel, above the perineum, between the small intestine and large intestine, outside the upper and lower dantian, in a part whose location is unknown to physiologists, he can generate a heat that can steam Shandong steamed buns, and he loses all consciousness and his yang energy flourishes. He feels comfortable all over. It is said that this heat, whose horsepower is unknown, is generated by the perverse flow of blood throughout the body, but it is definitely not a fever caused by fear of cold.</p>
<p>Wonderful, this is really the great way to prolong life and never grow old, which is more meaningful than Tai Chi and marathon, and more effective than the "Hundred-Year Machine". No wonder the straight-footed devils desperately worship the spiritual civilization of the mysterious Eastern country. Unfortunately, the current masses have incomplete Taoist bones and are not completely cleansed of the six senses. At the very least, they must go through ninety-nine and eighty-one tribulations before they can understand their own nature and become enlightened, achieve immortality and become a Buddha or ancestor, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight and become a world of immortals. It seems too early to talk about Tao in this 20th century.</p>

<p>There are two major relatives in life: when you are young, at your maternal grandmother's house; when you are old, at your mother-in-law's house; and when you are old, at your son-in-law's house.</p>
<p>Money and women are equally important in this extremely sharp capitalist city. Money can buy women, and women can make money.</p>
<p>Money, vanity, and licentiousness are the characteristics of the city. But the children and wives of the gentlemen who advocate maintaining morality and combating extravagance are playing the leading roles in these characteristics.</p>
<p>Many young people, if they suddenly find that on any corner of a book, or a piece of news, or an advertisement, there are words about women, or kissing and hugging, or romance and affairs, they will always quietly read it.</p>
<p>Women are born with an instinct to seduce; their smiles, their eyes, and their voices are the tools of seduction!</p>
<p>Some people say that women are vases; but I say that's not right. Because there are countless hardworking women in China who live inhuman lives.</p>
<p>When an elderly widow sees her children in pairs, that is her happiest moment, and also her saddest moment!</p>
<h3 id="e177">Shaving Poem <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Speaking of the word "shaving," it is also a tragic fact in history. In June of the second year of the Shunzhi period of the early Qing Dynasty, an edict was issued ordering the tonsure of hair. If anyone violated this edict, they would be "killed without mercy." Therefore, when the decree arrived in various counties, there was a severe penalty of "keep your head, not your hair; keep your hair, not your head." Even many shaving craftsmen were hired to carry the burden and parade in the streets. When they saw people with long hair, they would grab them and forcibly shave them. If they did not obey and resisted slightly, they would kill their heads and hang them on the poles of the burden to show the public. How cruel! Later, there were many people who died as martyrs because of this. There were even those who built "hair mounds" and secretly wept to offer sacrifices to express their sorrow. Therefore, the staunch defense of Jiangyin and the three massacres of our county can be said to have largely originated from shaving. The day before yesterday (the 29th of last month), I saw Mr. Huoxueming quoting a poem, "Hearing that the head can be shaved, now it is actually shaved." I remember that the old man from Deqing Dianqian also wrote an ancient meaning of shaving. This poem was not included when he compiled the poems, I don't know why, perhaps it was out of playful writing, then it was discarded. Just now I found the old manuscript I copied when I was a child in the pile of old paper, and I wrote it down. It can be seen that this old man depicted the matter of shaving more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Life is a matter of inches of skin, everything is sold, is it really a disease in the head, and then cut like grass, there are ancient sayings, quite enough for an examination, it seems to make it disappear, what is there with fleas, to compare the treatment of mountain bandits, first remove their way, who is this word for, so that Fubo old, try it on the little eunuch, and immediately will be sure to fall, after that Wen Tianxiang, there are poems in the posthumous manuscripts, hair is gone, the heart will exist, imagine the heat like a brazier, and I was born today, quite feel this thing is good, both to avoid the strong man rushing, also reduce the Shangshan Hao, after ten days without a shave, the head is like a pomelo, who is the executor of this, short clothes and broken jacket, into the kitchen call for soup, startled away the ginger-soup wife, pour water to wash the head basin, prostrate and salt the brain, a foot of cloth is not sewn, even more rough than the Lu gauze, to replace the grindstone, still able to protect the blade, but hear the sound of hoh, like cutting rice in the field, the bottom is carried by a plate, offering like a jade scepter, passing by the falling flowers, full head of defeated leaves swept away, I am not Tao Pengze, bending over also not annoyed, or even close both eyes, indistinguishable from white and black, lowering the head of millet and wheat, suddenly new as jujube, if there are louse-like ministers, do not ask the embryo or the aborted, after holding the hair three times, abandon the old and create a new one, interlaced green coral, black agate, my body leans for a long time, like wood branches withered, and you push and knock, like a bitter chanting island, the ear door does not allow wheat, also indulge in exploration, the tool is stored in a tube, should be called a gourd set, in a short while the skills are exhausted, and then wash the cheeks, looking at all kinds of hair, the wind is not dry, reward with bronze coins to the wine shop old woman, and I sit in a room, ears and eyes are washed from the heat, get up and look at the sunny sky, peep at the sun still bright, beard collection is not enough to blame, hair god may be prayed, chat to wake up the sleepy, not dare to boast of speed.</p>

<p>Furious Words Arouse Youth, Who Resigns from Office and Flees</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Compassion for Young Woman, Who Brings Cotton for Warmth</p>
<p>The two of them talked in the room for a long time. Mrs. Gan, in the main room, vaguely heard a sentence or two, which surprised her very much. She immediately went to Ji's room to see what was going on. At this time, Ji took out a large white rattan silk satchel from under the bed, wrapped the scattered utensils on the table one by one with newspaper, and stuffed them into the rattan satchel. Mrs. Gan said: "Oh! Second brother, what's wrong with you?" Ji then stood still and smiled at his sister-in-law: "Sister-in-law probably doesn't know yet, I have already resigned from my job with my brother. Since I have resigned, I have to show that I will no longer be a parasite from now on. I have to move into Beiping City today to find a new life and start my independent life." Mrs. Gan looked at him and hesitated for a long time before saying: "Are you serious?" Ji smiled: "Sister-in-law, take a look. I have prepared everything. This doesn't look like I'm telling lies and setting traps, does it?" Mrs. Gan heard that his voice today was not as sharp as before. She knew that Ji had made up his mind not to cooperate and was definitely not lying. So she said to Ji: "Did you have a conflict with your brother in the office?" Ji smiled faintly: "There is no such thing as a conflict. He is the director, and I am a staff member. Logically, I should be reprimanded by him." Mrs. Gan said: "Why do you have to be so resolute? You can always talk things over slowly. If your brother is wrong, I can help you judge the matter when he comes back. If you are wrong, it doesn't matter if your brother says a few words to you. No matter how wronged you are, wait for your brother to come back and talk about it." Ji shook his head and smiled: "I don't want to see him. Seeing his face will only lead to another lecture. Why should I be so spineless?" As he spoke, he continued to pack things on the table. Mrs. Gan said: "If you really want to leave, we can't stop you. But I don't know what happened between you two brothers that caused the dispute. You should let your brother come back before you leave, so I can give him an explanation." Ji pulled a long face and said: "Sister-in-law, do you think I have done something improper and ran away behind my brother's back? If that's what you think, I'll wait here for two hours, wait for my brother to come back before leaving. But there is one thing, I am the one who is leaving, please tell my brother not to scold me anymore." (90)</p>

<p>How to Preserve the Freshness of Vegetables</p>
<p>The types of vegetables we eat daily vary with the seasons. However, only people living in the countryside can eat fresh vegetables every day. As for those living in cities, they often cannot buy fresh goods on the same day due to uneven distribution and supply. Even if they can buy fresh goods on the same day, there are leftovers that are left for the next day, and there are also those who buy more ingredients in preparation for two or three days. Therefore, housewives should have a certain knowledge of preservation for the vegetables they buy every day, so that the vegetables they eat will not lose their fresh flavor. Now I will talk about the method of preserving freshness: First, after buying all kinds of green vegetables, they should be placed on dark sandy soil. It is most taboo to sprinkle water or soak them in water, and all kinds of vegetables must not be mixed, but should be stored separately. For example, taro and yam must not be placed in a humid place. If stored in this way, they will not lose their original fresh flavor. Ordinary women without common sense often do not know how to preserve them. Afraid that the vegetable leaves will dry out, they often sprinkle water on them or soak them in water. On the surface, they seem to be very fresh, but in fact, they not only lose their fresh flavor, but also the original chlorophyll, iron, and other nutrients are decomposed due to the water. Second, do not hang them in a ventilated place. If you are afraid that they will dry out, you can wrap them in two or three layers of newspaper. The outer newspaper should be sprayed wet with water and then tied tightly with a rope. Hang them in a dark place where there is no light, and they can be preserved for many days. As for the methods of preserving other types of vegetables, they vary according to their nature and shape. For example, melons, bamboo shoots, and eggplants, if they are to be preserved for seven or eight days, can be placed in a basket and filled with fir and cypress branches all around. If they are to be preserved for several months, you need a dry jar, with three or four parts of yellow sand paved below. Put the melons, bamboo shoots, eggplants, etc. on top, keeping each item from touching each other. Then fill it with two or three parts of yellow sand. After it is full, cover it tightly with thick straw paper, then dig a hole in the ground and put the jar in the hole, covering it with five inches of soil. Then, even after a year, it will not rot. Cabbage can be placed under dark sandy soil or wrapped in newspaper to preserve it for many days. However, when placing it, the cabbage heart should be facing upwards, and it must not be immersed in water, otherwise the cabbage heart will rot. However, the nature of celery is relatively different and should not be too dry. If you want to preserve its fresh flavor, you can wrap it in a damp towel and place it on a plate. Peas should be stored in a dark place with the pods attached, and they can be preserved for a long time. Fresh mushrooms should be filled with fir and cypress leaves and hung in a ventilated place. Ginger should be stored in a dry place away from sunlight, or it can be stored in a cement jar. In short, there are many types of vegetables, and it is impossible to explain them in detail one by one. It is best to place them on dark sandy soil away from sunlight, or to store them in a sandy soil jar. As for aristocratic families, they naturally have refrigerators and other various equipment, and even if they rot, they can be discarded at will. However, middle-class and lower-class families, in this era of expensive rice and firewood, buy vegetables with money earned from blood and sweat, and for economic reasons, they naturally cannot be discarded at will. However, everyone does not know how to preserve them, so they cannot store the leftovers for a long time and lose their fresh flavor, which is a great pity. As for fish and meat, you should distinguish their color. Beef and pork with bright red color are the best. The meat from the back and middle part of the animal is the most tender, that is, the part in the middle of the back bones and tendons. The meat from the buttocks is medium-grade meat, and the meat from the feet is low-grade meat. Low-grade meat is not easy to digest, and the nutrients are also relatively less. It is more difficult to choose fresh fish than other items. First, see if the scales of the fish are bright and if they do not easily fall off when you touch them with your hand. Second, smell the fish to see if its smell has changed. Third, see if the eyes of the fish are bright or sunken inward. Fourth, see if the color of the fish gills is bright red and transparent. Fifth, press the fish meat with your finger. If the finger leaves the fish meat and it is elastic and can still return to its original shape, it is fresh. If it is sunken and cannot recover, it is already rotten. Sixth, the anus of the fish is light red and protruding. Seventh, the fish belly is not easy to break. Eighth, the internal organs are not exposed. Ninth, if it is placed in water and sinks to the bottom, it is fresh. If it floats on the surface, it is rotten.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>I have always mostly used my real name when writing articles, because I am easily moved by my personal experiences, and I cannot help but touch upon sensitive realities. I take responsibility for my own words to avoid implicating friends. I seek peace of mind and have no intention of "showing off" by doing this. I do not accept Mr. Yingying's claim that I am "showing off to a great extent."</p>
<p>Observing the world, what living beings enact is either tragedy or comedy. Even something like "love of showing off" may not always go as one wishes. Cao Kun rose from a small cloth merchant to a military inspector and then became the President. He had experienced the full range of worldly riches and could be said to have shown off to the fullest extent. In 1926, when Beijing was recruiting soldiers, some people used this as a front for their own purposes. At that time, there must have been many who dreamed of wearing a diagonally slung belt. Seeing this sign, they fully believed they could gain an official position to brag about to their neighbors. But some, like Wei Yancan, ended up drowning his wife and killing his children, then throwing himself into the Huangpu River; others, like a certain staff officer, couldn't even get a job pulling a rickshaw. They either earned pity or were ridiculed. Only then did they realize that it was all a mistake based on the idea of "wanting to show off." My friend N, in 1924, felt depressed and unfulfilled, and went to Guangdong, enrolling in the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1927, he returned to Zhejiang from Jiangxi in glory. How impressive! Many friends wanted to give up writing and join the army, going to Beijing to take the military academy entrance exam. I said, "Cao Kun came from selling cloth, that's true. But don't forget, Yuan Shikai trained troops at Xiaozhan."</p>
<p>"At that time, Cao Kun was already a platoon leader. From training troops at Xiaozhan to becoming the Minister of Beiyang, from the Minister of Beiyang to becoming the President of the Republic, the Xiaozhan buddies became the big shots of Beiyang. The development of this group should absolutely not be ignored. The ancients spoke of fate and opportunity, and opportunity is the most important. Waiting until Cao Kun became the President to 'stand at attention and rest' would be too late!" Sure enough, they wore the diagonally slung belts for three years and then went home to eat old rice. Starting with the desire to show off and ending with bad luck, you can still let me say, "Unfortunately, I was right," which is of course a type of comedy.</p>
<p>Then there are those who want to show off and actually do show off. Three or five years ago, a certain person flipped a somersault and became a popular figure in Shanghai, commanding a hundred responses with a single call, and having a house full of wives and concubines. Friends said that no one was more successful at showing off than this person. But before long, he flipped another somersault and became a nobody. His door was deserted, and no one paid attention to him. Suffering when gaining and suffering when losing, Mencius became a prophet from thousands of years ago. Because they could "be arrogant to their wives and concubines" and "many poor people could get help from me," many people unknowingly were forced onto the path of showing off. When embarking on this path, they would "bid farewell to the old flowers and willows of South Lake, to keep the misty moon company with the returning oars." Once they reached "the Eastern Market, the official robes were measured and ended, and the earth of Northern Mountain could not be kept," they could only say "Too late to regret." Even if they show off, they still cannot avoid acting out a tragicomedy, so what is there to say? As for criticizing figures, there has never been a good outcome in ancient or modern times. Confucius, a master of praise and criticism, lived a restless life, running into walls everywhere. Kong Rong was outspoken, and Cao Cao simply sent him to the execution ground. Ruan Ji and Ji Kang, two masters of humor, even though they drank and took medicine every day, still offended the authorities, who said they were destroying the proper teachings. Truly, truly, the lesson of the Xia Dynasty is not far off. Recently, Ji Kang's family instructions taught his son to be careful in his dealings. One instruction said not to visit officials too often, nor to stay overnight. When officials see people off, do not be behind them, because it is feared that when officials punish bad people in the future, you will be suspected of secretly reporting them. Another instruction said that if there is an argument at a banquet, you should leave immediately to avoid criticizing from the sidelines, because there must be right and wrong between the two parties. Not criticizing is not proper, but criticizing will mean that one party will dislike the other. The old masters of pure conversation did not encourage their children to criticize figures. To want to show off by criticizing figures is the act of a fool.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the philosophy of showing off should be "Show off less." Lao Tzu's "guarding the feminine" and "guarding the black" mean this. If writing articles is for the sake of showing off, then I might as well put down my pen.</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Origin of Flower Gambling <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Li Tiao</p>
<p>I discussed flower gambling last time. In the article, I was quite critical of flower gambling. Yesterday, I came across Inoue Koubai's "Wine, Sparrow, and Opium," which had a chapter on the origin of flower gambling. After reading it carefully, I suddenly realized that I had been disrespectful to this beneficial business. I am now translating it to record my error.</p>
<p>"The origin of flower gambling is said to be as follows:</p>
<p>In the past, when the Luoyang Bridge in Henan had not yet been built, the people on both sides of the river found it very inconvenient and often prayed that someone would build a bridge there. The Jade Emperor was moved and summoned Guanyin Bodhisattva, ordering her to build the bridge. Guanyin Bodhisattva felt that it was very difficult without funding. After trying all sorts of methods, she had to use her own beauty, rowed a boat, and stopped on the side of the river, proclaiming that she would marry whoever could throw silver onto her body. She then transformed into twelve beautiful incarnations standing at the bow of the boat. The people on both sides of the river threw countless amounts of money at her, but no one could hit her. At that time, a beggar priest came. He took out a piece of silver from his dirty sock and threw it at Guanyin Bodhisattva. Not only did it hit, but it landed perfectly on Guanyin Bodhisattva's chest. Guanyin Bodhisattva was extremely surprised. Who was this beggar priest? She calculated with her fingers and realized that it was the Taoist patriarch Lü Dongbin. So Guanyin Bodhisattva said very angrily:</p>
<p>"I am doing this for the convenience of the people, and you are hindering me. Now I am leaving and you are responsible for everything!" After saying this, Guanyin Bodhisattva's form disappeared. Lü Dongbin, having caused trouble, thought carefully. Although this was annoying, he had to build the bridge as the Jade Emperor had ordered. So he thought and thought, and came up with the game of 'flower gambling.' Previously, gambling was one-to-one odds, but flower gambling paid thirty times the bet if you won. Therefore, men and women, young and old, all came to sell, and in an instant, a huge amount of money was raised and the bridge construction was completed."</p>
<p>After translating Inoue Koubai's wonderful article, I couldn't help but think that there are indeed many Guanyin Bodhisattvas and Lü Dongbins in China today. Look, aren't those embracing, compassionate Guanyin Bodhisattvas sacrificing their looks? Look, isn't it clearly written below that big kite: 52,000 yuan? The clever immortal Grandpa Lü Dongbin has innovated and come up with some deformed "flower gambling" games.</p>
<p>Guanyin Bodhisattva and Pure Yang Patriarch have all descended to the mortal world together, so how can China not become strong!</p>
<h3 id="e182">Faded Life <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>As it was getting dark, there was a sudden commotion downstairs, with everyone talking at once, making it hard to hear. Xunzhen, who loves to watch the excitement, hurriedly dropped the unfinished clothes she was cutting and went downstairs. Downstairs, I only heard someone saying amidst the noise, "Goodness, luckily the weather is warm. Otherwise, he would have died of the cold even if he didn't drown."</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Xunzhen came running upstairs with news. She started by saying, "Shen Tianxi, the man who sells chicken and duck blood downstairs, jumped into the Huangpu River."</p>
<p>Jumped into the Huangpu? I was shocked. Jumping into the Huangpu means seeking death, suicide. Why would he seek death? So I listened to Xunzhen's story. She said:</p>
<p>"He jumped in but was rescued by the water police. Just now the police came and called away the landlord and his niece, A Jin. It's still not known if he's alive or dead."</p>
<p>As long as he was rescued, he probably didn't die. Otherwise, how would the police know his home and come to notify them? In just three days, another big event happened in this building. Two days ago, the woman in the shanty gave birth. I heard the baby crying, then heard adults calling the woman's name, and soon heard the family wailing, saying she had died. In less than an hour, a life was born into this world and another life died. At the time, I thought that a living person had to exchange a life in order for a life to be safely preserved. Little did she know that people would use life to exchange for life.</p>
<p>Yet here was another life hovering on the edge of death. That woman gave birth to exchange for a life, so what was this for? From spring to summer, the newspapers report news of people throwing themselves into the Huangpu River every day. Probably this piece of news will be published in the newspaper tomorrow as well. Usually, news in the newspaper is labeled as "Unable to make a living..." Isn't it also that they seek death in order to seek life? Old Man Shen probably isn't an exception, right? But I became suspicious and started thinking irrationally:</p>
<p>Old Man Shen is a middle-aged man with a smiling face and a kind disposition, dark-skinned and tall with a full beard. Although we often do business with him, buying sixty or one hundred coins worth of fresh chicken and duck blood, we don't talk much. Sometimes when I come back late at night, Xunzhen doesn't dare to go downstairs, so he mostly opens the door for me. His bed is right in the downstairs living room. During the day, he puts away the mosquito net and leans the bed board against the corner of the wall. He doesn't have a wife, she died long ago. He has a niece who is fourteen or fifteen years old, who washes clothes and cooks at home. I heard that he raised her since she was little. He goes out to do business in the early morning and morning, and comes home in the afternoon. When doing business with him, I once asked him how much business he could do in a day, and he said that after deducting the capital, he could earn four or five strings of cash a day. We exclaimed that it was a good business. However, his clothes are tattered, patched upon patched. We assume that he is overly frugal, wanting to save money and rebuild his dream. Because he is at most forty years old. That's all I know. But he is seeking death today. I decided that it is not "unable to make a living," because he can earn four or five strings of cash a day.</p>
<p>Soon more news came from downstairs. What it was, I didn't know. I was lost in thought, smoking a cigarette in my fingers, trying to explore the cause of this suicide by drowning. Xunzhen sat next to me and said:</p>
<p>"Old Man Shen didn't die, he's in the hospital now. A Jin just came back. Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival. Old Man Shen went out yesterday. When he left, he asked A Jin to do his business for a day in his place, saying he had something to do in Pudong. He told her to keep the money from the sales carefully, and if she didn't see him come back, to pack up her things and go back to her hometown in Changzhou. Old Man Shen was preparing to seek death."</p>
<p>"Do you know why he sought death now?"</p>
<p>"According to the landlord, he owes too much usurious interest, and the money he earns isn't enough to pay the interest. He often said he wanted to seek death, or leave Shanghai. Yesterday, when he went out, A Jin thought he was running away from debt."</p>
<p>So that's how it is. Although Old Man Shen earns four or five strings of cash a day, he ultimately cannot escape the example of "unable to make a living." Yet now he can't even seek death. This life, there's really nothing that can be done with it.</p>
<p>The next day, Old Man Shen came back, still with his dark face and full beard, but the smile on his face was gone. When I saw him, I thought to myself, is he back from the edge of death? Yet he carried on with his business as usual. A Jin took out a silver dollar and told Xunzhen that this was the money he had with him that day when he left, and it hadn't been lost after being tossed around in the water. Shunzhen said that the character pasted on top made of cut red paper had faded in color. That was naturally because it had been soaked in water. Old Man Shen's heart, I thought, was probably somewhat like that red character. A little faded, right?</p>
<p>In less than a month since moving into this building, I have seen two sad things: one is exchanging a life for a life, and the other is washing a little color off a life in the water.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Carrot Hair <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— JULES KENARD, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>The Sheep</p>
<p>Carrot Hair first only saw some blurry, moving spheres. These spheres emitted deafening, mixed cries, just like some children playing in the school's two playgrounds. The spheres hit against his crotch, making him feel a little uncomfortable. Another sphere was wriggling fiercely under the light from the small window in the roof. It was a lamb. Carrot Hair smiled because he had been startled. His eyes gradually adjusted to the darkness, and he could see the situation inside clearly. The lambing season had arrived. Every morning, the small tenant farmer Bazzole could add two or three lambs. He found them wandering among the ewes, looking dull-witted, their bodies standing on stiff legs, like four very thick pieces of wood, trembling.</p>
<p>Carrot Hair still didn't dare to touch them. But they were bolder, sucking on his shoes, or holding a piece of dry grass in their mouths, stepping on him with their front feet.</p>
<p>Those that were a week old powerfully stretched their bodies, twisting and turning in the air. Those that were only a day old were very weak, often kneeling down, but still standing up energetically. A lamb that had just been born was crawling on the ground, still sticky and not yet licked. Its mother, obstructed by a swaying bag full of water, pushed it away with her head. "This is a bad mother!" Carrot Hair said.</p>
<p>"It's the same in animals as it is in humans," Bazzole said.</p>
<p>"She must want to give it to a wet nurse."</p>
<p>"Almost like that," Bazzole said. "Some lambs have to be fed with a feeding bottle, like the kind we buy at the pharmacy."</p>
<p>Bottle, but it doesn't last long, because the mother will be moved. And we can also force the mother to give in."</p>
<p>He grabbed her shoulder and dragged her away, placing her in a bottle. He tied a grass collar around her neck, so she could be identified if she drowned. The lamb followed its mother. The ewe loudly ate grass, and the lamb weakly looked up, standing on its soft feet, looking for milk to eat, looking very pitiful, its face covered in a trembling, congealed juice.</p>
<p>"Do you think she will have a day when she becomes more compassionate?" Carrot Hair said?</p>
<p>"Yes, when her lower body is better," Bazzole said. "She was in a lot of pain when she gave birth."</p>
<p>"But I still think my idea is good," Carrot Hair said. "Why not temporarily give the lamb to another ewe to nurse?"</p>
<p>"She would refuse," Bazzole said.</p>
<p>Indeed, the cries of the ewes from the four corners of the sheepfold, announcing that it was feeding time, mixed together. The cries sounded monotonous to Carrot Hair's ears, but to the lambs, they had subtle differences, because each lamb jumped straight to its own mother's udder without any confusion.</p>
<p>"There are absolutely no ewes here that steal children."</p>
<p>"It's strange, this kind of family instinct in sheep," Carrot Hair said, "How can they distinguish the smell?" Maybe it's because"</p>
<p>Sense of smell is keen."</p>
<p>He almost wanted to plug a sheep's nose to test it.</p>
<p>He compared humans and lambs carefully, he wanted to know the names of the lambs. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e184">How to Revive China's Silk Industry Shang Hoping <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The reasons for the decline of China's silk industry, listed in the biggest, can be analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign (1) The world's economic downturn; (2) The exploitation by Japanese silk; (3) The partial squeezing out of artificial silk.</p>
<p>Domestic (1) Declining rural economy; (2) The use of scientific methods to improve mulberry trees, silkworm eggs, silk, etc. has not yet become widespread; (3) The political capabilities of the central and local governments are rarely used to fundamentally address and relieve the silkworm industry; (4) Transactions of silk, cocoons, silkworm eggs, mulberry, etc. completely lack appropriate organizations; (5) Sound central research silk authorities are still lacking."</p>
<p>In this complex environment, in order to seek effective countermeasures, can be divided into palliative and fundamental solutions, and progress simultaneously. Among the palliative measures, the reduction and exemption of taxes on silk cocoons, etc., and various incentives, have been gradually implemented by the Central Government and the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and will not be discussed in detail here. However, palliative and fundamental measures must be mutually reinforced, otherwise they will lose their effectiveness and cannot be sustained, and will inevitably be abandoned halfway. Now, the fundamental strategies are described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>My country's raw silk used to be sold to Europe and the United States, and in recent years the European and American markets have been completely seized by Japanese silk. There are three reasons for this: (1) The quality of raw silk is not pure; (2) There is too little silk of the same quality, which cannot meet the demand of the European and American markets; (3) The cost is too high, and it cannot compete with others' low prices. Moreover, these three problems are interrelated, so fundamental solutions must be resolved simultaneously. The solution can be divided into agriculture, industry, and commerce to achieve the goal of low prices, good quality, and large quantities.</p>
<p>A. In terms of agriculture:</p>
<p>The raw material of silk is cocoon. The quality and price of cocoon, whether it is pure or mixed, depends on whether scientific methods are applied to planting mulberry trees, making silkworm eggs, and raising silkworms, and whether there is an appropriate organization. Therefore, the following should be carried out simultaneously. (1) "Planting mulberry trees" actual situation; mulberry is the raw material of cocoon, so we must first seek its low price and good quality. According to recent years, in the prosperous areas of sericulture in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the average yield of leaves per mu of mulberry field is less than seven or eight dan, compared with a reasonable mulberry garden, which can produce more than 20 dan per mu, only one-third of the production. If there are floods and insect pests, or farmers are poor and there is insufficient fertilization, the production is even lower, so the leaf quality is poor and the cost is heavy. (Improvement measures;) In areas where mulberry improvement has reached a considerable level, lend mulberry seedlings and fertilizers to farmers, and guide the new methods of deep plowing, cutting mulberry trees, and removing insects. (2) "Making silkworm eggs" (actual situation;) The achievements of improving silkworm eggs have been recognized by the society and farmers, so there is no need to discuss it, but the quantity is still small, the supply cannot meet the demand, and it cannot be popularized, which is regrettable. According to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the annual demand for silkworm eggs in spring and autumn is about 12 million sheets, and the current output is less than 20%, among which there are still rough and shoddy products to make up the numbers, and the required 120,000 sheets of silkworm eggs have not completely specified the manufacturing agency. (Improvement measures;) Private egg farms should be supervised and encouraged by the government, and implemented at the same time. Select a suitable location, plant a large number of mulberry gardens for seed use, and recruit merchants to produce silkworm eggs to supplement the insufficient quantity of silkworm eggs. At the same time, the central government should set up an experimental farm for the research and unification of varieties, and stipulate the varieties used throughout the country. (3) "Raising silkworms" (actual situation;) In unimproved sericulture areas, farmers use local species. From raising the silkworms to going up to the cluster, everything does not conform to scientific methods, and the harvest is less than one-tenth or two-tenths. Even if the harvest is slightly abundant, the cocoon quality is also poor, so the silkworm raising method urgently needs guidance. (Improvement measures;) Set up a model area for improving sericulture, organize silkworm-raising cooperatives, so as to guide farmers' silkworm-raising methods, and set up guidance stations in places where there are no model areas. It can disinfect, raise silkworms and raise young silkworms on behalf of farmers, and guide them to improve the method of going up to the cluster. (4) "Improving the organization of cocoon collection" In addition to the above three items, the organization of cocoon collection also has a great relationship in improving cocoon quality. The organization of cocoon collection is not good, the evaluation is not commensurate with the cocoon quality, that is, there is no way to reward high quality, and the promotion of improvement will naturally be hindered invisibly. The varieties of raw material cocoons are mixed, the quality of silk produced is low, and the cost is increased. This is the biggest reason for the failure of silk mills in recent years. Therefore, we should use scientific management methods to improve the organization of cocoon collection. The evaluation should be suitable, so that we can collect high-quality cocoons at a high price, and eliminate inferior cocoons. We should also pay attention to the purity of varieties, which is an important key to improving cocoon quality in addition to the above three items.</p>
<p>B. In terms of industry;</p>
<p>The success or failure of silk mills is of course very important to the raw material cocoons, as mentioned above, but the precision of machinery and the legality of management are also important. Promote the establishment of new silk mills (multi-strand slow-speed silk machines) and improve old silk mills, in order to increase the output of high-grade raw silk (uniformity above 83 points), so as to compete with Japanese silk in the European and American markets, because Chinese silk of the same grade as Japanese silk is more popular in the European and American markets.</p>
<p>C. In terms of commerce;</p>
<p>My country's raw silk has no sound organization in international market trade. Each transports and sells, each acts on its own, and each does not plan for each other. There is no transport and sales agency at home and abroad to be responsible for investigation, promotion, and publicity. Compared with Japan, it is inevitable that it will be inferior. Therefore, the organization of international transport and sales agencies and the establishment of silk financial institutions to regulate them are all urgent measures.</p>
<p>To sum up the above, agriculture is planting mulberry trees, making silkworm eggs, raising silkworms, and selling cocoons; the silk industry is from agriculture, industry, and commerce. From beginning to end, vertical and horizontal mutual relations must have a consistent policy, and everything must have a connection organization, in order to achieve the most economical purpose. On the one hand, we should use the superior silk quality, low labor cost, and suitable soil and climate of our country, and at the same time use scientific new methods to proceed. If we can do so, and its products cannot compete in the international market and cannot restore its former glory, who can believe it?</p>
<h3 id="e185">Policies for Improving China's Silk Industry by Xia Dao Xiang <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Raw silk is now an international trade commodity. The rise and fall of its exports can be used to measure the prosperity or decline of a country's silk industry. By looking at the table below, we can imagine the state of our country's silk industry in recent years.</p>
<p>Table of Chinese Silk Exports (Quantity unit: dan; Value unit: Customs taels)</p>
<p>Year | Export Quantity | Export Value</p>
<p>------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 15 | 168,563 | 144,826,358</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 16 | 160,002 | 128,705,732</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 17 | 180,186 | 145,443,481</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 18 | 189,980 | 147,681,338</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 19 | 151,429 | 109,181,124</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 20 | 136,186 | 84,680,482</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 21 | 78,219 | 32,932,250</p>
<p>From the above table, we know that the export of raw silk from our country recently, whether in terms of quantity or value, has decreased sharply. However, compared with the figures of the United States, the largest consumer of raw silk in the world, and Japan, the largest exporter, listed in the table below, the difference is much greater. (The consumption of the United States and the export volume of Japan have not decreased, only the price has fallen.)</p>
<p>Table of Raw Silk Consumption in the United States and Raw Silk Exports in Japan</p>
<p>Year | Raw Silk Consumption in the United States (dan) | Raw Silk Export Volume in Japan (dan) | Value (Japanese Yen)</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 15 | 510,546 | 442,978,743 | 052,443</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 16 | 551,379 | 521,773,742 | 265,820</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 17 | 571,010 | 549,256,733 | 436,584</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 18 | 619,747 | 80,950,784,150 | 494</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 19 | 582,226 | 477,322,419 | 107,335</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 20 | 594,889 | 660,417,356 | 694,256</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 21 | 553,818 | 548,236,382 | 878,689</p>
<p>From this, we have two major questions: 1. The world's consumption of raw silk has not decreased, and Japan's exports remain the same. Why is our country's exports so small? 2. Our country is far superior to Japan in terms of the factors of silk industry operation. Why can Japan maintain its previous export volume even after repeated sharp declines in silk prices, while our country declines miserably after a slight blow and cannot recover? What is the reason? In my opinion, the authorities in charge of the Japanese silk industry have been striving to improve the quality of raw silk to meet the needs of Europe and the United States. At the same time, they have been working hard to reduce the cost of raw silk to cope with the trend of world economic decline. There are also various related aspects that work together in a mutually reinforcing cycle, which is why the current situation exists. Our country is not like this. Most of the authorities in charge, except for a few, cannot make the finished products adapt to the needs of the world trend. The cost cannot be reduced as the economy declines. They always hope for government assistance. At this time of national treasury emptiness, how can they always provide this kind of relief! I deeply hope that the authorities in charge of the silk industry will make a decision. Now I will briefly state my humble opinions below for correction by those in charge.</p>
<p>As an international commodity, and a clothing product, under the world economic situation, it is not easy to increase the price of goods. Now, the only way is to reduce costs and improve quality under the falling silk prices, in order to increase the export volume.</p>
<p>Those who are engaged in sericulture, from mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing to raw silk sales, should all follow the above principles to seek the revitalization of the sericulture industry itself. This is the key point. As for how to produce cheap and high-quality raw silk? I have discussed it in detail in the article "Discussion on Modern Silk Industry Issues in Our Country" in the second issue of the second volume of the International Trade Guide. Now I will state my new feelings below: 1. Raw Material Cocoon Quality Issue: The quality of raw silk largely depends on whether the quality of raw material cocoons is uniform or not. In the past, Chinese silkworm cocoon varieties were mixed and of poor quality, resulting in poor finished products and large reeling waste. In the future, we hope to use excellent, suitable, and unified as the principle. Now there is a sericulture joint control committee in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to handle this matter, and the future is promising.</p>
<p>2. Silkworm Cocoon Trading Issue: 75% of the cost of raw silk is the cocoon cost. Therefore, to reduce the cost of raw silk, it is not effective if the cocoon cost is not low. At a time when silk prices are falling and futures sales are decreasing, it is extremely risky for silk factories to conduct fresh cocoon trading, and farmers and silkworm breeders are misled by the occasional rise in cocoon prices. It is better to switch to dry cocoon trading, using the current silk price as the standard to calculate the dry cocoon price, so that both sericulture and silk reeling parties can share the benefits and bear the harm together. The entire sericulture industry maintains an attitude of coexistence and co-prosperity. However, this kind of dry cocoon trading is that the silkworm breeders sell the dry cocoons directly to the silk factories, which is definitely not the dry cocoon trading between the surplus cocoon merchants and silk factories currently practiced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, there are still two points to consider when conducting dry cocoon trading: 1. Silkworm cocoon drying and storage require machinery, technology, hygiene, and appropriate warehouses, which cannot be undertaken by the silkworm farmers themselves. Under the current situation, it is necessary to use cooperative methods to establish organizations for dry storage cooperation, and the government should stand in a guiding and assisting position. 2. In recent years, in the era of low prices of agricultural products, the farmers' economy is extremely difficult. It is not possible for the current economic situation of farmers to store the cocoons obtained from sericulture for a long time and wait for a good price. It seems that it is not effective to conduct dry cocoon mortgages. It is difficult for current banks to handle these small dry cocoon mortgages. It is better for the previous cooperatives to handle the mortgages. However, how can the cooperatives have such huge funds? It is hoped that the government will guarantee the cooperatives to borrow money from the banks and then conduct dry cocoon mortgages, which seems easier.</p>
<p>3. Mechanical Transformation Issue: If there are excellent and uniform raw materials, to obtain uniform raw silk production, it is necessary to have proper processing. In this processing process, some rely entirely on the skilled technology of female workers, such as the Gunze system factories in Japan; some rely on the assistance of excellent machinery, such as the Katakura system factories in Japan. Considering the current situation of silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is not easy to use skilled female workers with new technologies to produce high-quality raw silk. It is easier to achieve results by using the assistance of excellent machinery, such as the rapid efficiency of silk factories in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. It is hoped that silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang will rise up and switch to using slow-speed multi-end machines. (After testing this type of machine in a silk factory in Hangzhou, I strongly urged silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to switch to it.)</p>
<p>4. Management Reform Issue: In the past, silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang mostly operated on a small scale, and the management methods were very outdated. In the future, they should refer to the following principles to implement reforms:</p>
<p>1. Operators must make long-term plans; 2. Efforts should be made to improve equipment and technology for increasing raw silk production; 3. Strengthen training for employees directly involved in production, and pay attention to their hygiene protection and education; 4. Save expenses and provide preferential treatment to producers; 5. Producers and sellers should cooperate to facilitate large-scale direct exports.</p>
<h3 id="e186">On China's Silk Industry Control Policy by Zong Fan <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Inevitability of Silk Industry Control</p>
<p>China's silk industry, since being oppressed by the Japanese silk industry and affected by the international economic panic in the most recent years, with the disastrous fall in prices and the reduction in export figures, has suffered a tragedy unprecedented in the history of its silk industry. The closure of silk factories everywhere, not to mention the losses of sericultural farmers, with eight or nine out of ten going bankrupt due to losses, and those who committed suicide themselves or even their whole families were also common occurrences. This was last year's cocoon harvest.</p>
<p>What is the situation this year? There is no definite report yet; but it can be predicted that farmers' sericulture is even more unprofitable, and silk factories are struggling in hardship.</p>
<p>Is there no hope for China's silk industry after all? That's not entirely true. Take Japan as an example: their natural climate and the quality of silkworm cocoons are not as good as China's, and their labor costs are two or three times higher than China's. But they can barely maintain because of the consistent spirit from top to bottom, unifying silkworm varieties, reducing production costs, consistent raw material cocoon silk reeling capacity, and improving raw silk sales control. In simple terms: it is to maximize the scientific nature of technology and fully control management, so although silk prices have decreased, the number of ports can still be maintained considerably.</p>
<p>In China, although there are many natural endowments, there is no organization and no scientific basis in all aspects of sericulture, silk reeling, and sales. To seek the revival and development of the silk industry, there is naturally only one way out, which is to exert the full power of the government and unite all aspects of agriculture, industry, and commerce regarding all planting, breeding, sericulture, cocoon sales, silk reeling, and even foreign trade, whether technical or economic, and move forward from the policy of control.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Origin of Economic Control Policies <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Economic control policies are now not only applied to the silk industry, but also to all other industries and all other countries 丨丨 whether it is the Soviet Union, a socialist country, the United Kingdom and the United States, capitalist countries, or Italy, which is ruled by a pan-fascist party, they all have to adopt this kind of policy.</p>
<p>Before the Soviet Russian socialist economic policy was successful and before the world economic panic was fully intensified, the entire world economy was dominated by the consistent ideas of Adam Smith's free economy. His slogan was: "Develop production, obtain profits, accumulate personal wealth, to increase the country's resources." Because of the domination of this economic thought, on a small scale, there was a laissez-faire economic organization within the country, and on a large scale, free trade regulations were established in the world. However, after the extreme development of capitalism and the increasingly fierce economic competition between countries, the unprecedented great war in Europe arose from this. At the same time, due to the occurrence of cartels, trusts, and industrial rationalization movements, small controls were formed in each industrial sector, suppressing the majority of the working masses internally and fighting head-on with other capitalist countries externally. In the mutual infighting, the flaws of capitalism gradually became exposed, and an unprecedented world economic panic occurred.</p>
<p>The production of the controlled economic movement is the liquidation of the past laissez-faireism, putting all industries under orderly and planned control, with the entire country as a group, internally combining capital and labor, creating a self-sufficient world, and externally preventing the harm of various countries, or using this force to oppress small groups. This controlled economic plan movement, the pan-ideological Italy, had already promulgated laws in 1926 and was proceeding step by step. And since the Soviet Union implemented the Five-Year Plan in 1927, its excellent achievements have shocked all countries in the world!</p>
<p>Regarding the silk industry, the organization of the Silk Industry Improvement Committee in Italy and the implementation of various control methods in Japan have all achieved significant results.</p>
<h3 id="e188">The Future Trend of China's Silk Industry Control <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Under the current situation in China, to require the improvement of mulberry gardens, the unification of silkworm varieties, the reduction of cocoon prices, the superior quality of silk, and the increase in market prices, it is naturally necessary for all aspects of agriculture, industry, and commerce to make planned, systematic, and step-by-step progress under the guidance and supervision of the government.</p>
<p>In the past one or two years, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have indeed been proceeding in the direction mentioned above. This year, they have also reorganized the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Control Committee, and it is heard that they have decided on considerable steps and are preparing to make active progress.</p>
<p>However, we hope that the government and people in the silk industry will not forget the interests of the farmers, the most central force of the silk industry, when carrying out the controlled economic movement! The Russian controlled economic policy, of course, seeks the welfare of the entire people, without any personal intentions. Even the most important goal of the Italian pan-fascist controlled economic movement is to stop and hinder the production of capitalist factories; to increase the profits of all workers; and to ban the exorbitant profits of banks and exchanges. In short, the purpose of this controlled economic movement is to use the entire national power to revitalize industry internally, resist aggression externally, and, on the one hand, to revive the collapsing rural economy, and on the other hand, to resist foreign silk industry competition. Therefore, it is necessary to seek the interests of the entire silk industry, and it must not be for the benefit of a few factory owners and a few breeding experts!</p>
<p>In the past, the high price sale of improved silkworm varieties made it impossible for those who could not afford to buy them to enjoy the benefits. Farmers in Yuhang and Lin'an, Zhejiang, opposed the new breeding methods. Although according to the official report, old-style breeding merchants were stirring up trouble, the implementers' spirit failed to make the people understand, and they cannot but resign their responsibility. And the recent restriction on cocoon prices, although it is also an unavoidable measure. But if we cannot first fundamentally plan the cost of sericulture for farmers and make an overall plan for farmers' lives, simply suppressing prices is still harming the people. It is still a long way from the modern so-called new economic movement 丨丨 controlled economic movement. The so-called improvement of the silk industry will become a mere term.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Lessons from Japan's Silk Industry Control by Yu <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>China, known as the ancestor of the silk industry, has recently been unable to live up to its reputation of more than four thousand years of history, and it has been in a slump. However, the silk industry of Japan, a small island country, has leapt to the first place in the world in terms of both production and trade. The reason why the Japanese have such a position is definitely not due to luck or chance, but due to decades of struggle and effort. This article intends to give a brief description of Japan's silk control for the reference of our silk cocoon industry.</p>
<p>1. Control to Improve Silk Quality</p>
<p>In the early Meiji period, in order to prevent crude manufacturing and compete with advanced countries such as France and Italy, the government adopted the following controls to improve quality: 1. The silk industry established raw silk inspection stations by the state to inspect exported raw silk, and each province and county government and silk industry association also established raw silk inspection agencies. 2. Sericulture (A) The silkworm industry control office and silkworm seed industry association, etc., forcibly implemented silkworm seed inspection. (B) In terms of silkworm seed and breeding methods, 1. Establish a silkworm industry experiment station, 2. Subsidize young silkworm joint breeding centers and joint mulberry gardens, etc., 3. The public automatically organizes silkworm seed sub-farms to operate and specially contract associations, etc.</p>
<p>2. Control of Scaling Up</p>
<p>The control of scaled-up management is to make up for the following shortcomings of small-scale management in the silk industry with combinations, joint facilities, and other legal controls. 1. Crude manufacturing and abuse of trust; 2. There is often a danger of overproduction, resulting in the disastrous fall of silk and cocoon prices due to reckless sales, which is no different from suicide; 3. Cannot have the ability to control market prices like large-scale enterprises; market prices often fluctuate; 4. Lack of control among peers, resulting in the inability to share the benefits of large-scale transactions such as jointly obtaining raw materials and selling products; 5. There is an intermediary profit between purchasing raw materials and selling products. Recently, small-scale operators; on the one hand, are oppressed by capital, and on the other hand, are sacrificed by the fall in silk prices. To avoid this pain, it is necessary to have a joint sericulture section to briefly explain as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Silk Reeling Industry (A) Organized according to government laws, such as industrial combination silk reeling. It was opened in the tenth year of the Meiji era. At that time, manual silk reelers (i.e., silkworm farmers) jointly invested in silk reeling in order to reach a certain export volume, which is called group silk reeling. In the 33rd year of the Meiji era, the Industrial Combination Law was promulgated, giving various groups a legal basis. The government also gave tax exemption preferential treatment and gave various financial conveniences. The silk reeling method has also changed from manual to machine. At the same time, it contains the exclusion of intermediaries and the oppression of silk reelers by silkworm farmers. In the second year of the Showa era, the combination silk reeling industry established the Japan Raw Silk Sales Combination Federation, which sells the raw silk of the combination directly to exporters. Recently, it announced an expansion plan, wanting to increase from the current annual production capacity of 22,000 dan to 44,000 dan within five years, and it is expected to establish a sales office in New York from the tenth year of the Showa era to trade directly with the United States. (B) The government sets subsidies to promote the development of the silk reeling industry. For example, the provisional meeting in the seventh year of the Showa era resolved to pay a reward of 2.6 million yuan in ten years. The first 120,000 yuan has been paid in the seventh year of the Showa era. (C) Organized by the person concerned automatically, such as the Japan Silk Association, etc. (D) Restricted by law, stipulating the minimum limit for newly established businesses; the Silk Reeling Industry Law promulgated in September and implemented in October of the seventh year of the Showa era stipulates that the mechanical manufacturing industry must be approved by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and a newly established mechanical factory must have at least 150 ends, otherwise it will not be approved.</p>
<p>(2) Sericulture (A) Those organized according to the laws promulgated by the government include sericulture associations, silkworm seed industry associations, etc. Its business is to unify silkworm species, guide sericulture, inspect cocoons, improve cocoon trading methods, prevent silkworm diseases, mediate sericulture disputes, and improve other aspects of sericulture. (B) The government subsidizes the joint cocoon warehouse organized by the industrial association. The purpose is to stabilize cocoon prices, implement large-scale dry cocoon storage, and prevent silkworm farmers from selling due to financial difficulties. According to the investigation, there are already 65 groups that have received government subsidies in the seventh year of the Showa era. In addition, it pre-lends money. (C) The person concerned automatically initiates and implements the sub-farm management method. (D) Restricted by law, stipulating the minimum limit for newly established silkworm seed businesses. The detailed rules for the implementation of the Silk Industry Law in the fourth year of the Showa era stipulate that the silkworm seed industry must have certain equipment and must not be less than 100,000 moths per year. Otherwise, it will not be allowed to be established.</p>
<p>3. Control of Enterprise and Raw Material Monopoly</p>
<p>Since the silk reeling industry has separated from the sericulture industry and developed into an independent industry. The most concerned about the silk reelers is how to obtain cheap and beautiful raw materials. Especially since the area of origin, although the silk price has fallen, the silk output has not decreased, but the profit has been reduced. In order to maintain their past position, the silk reelers, on the one hand, try to improve silk reeling technology and increase silk reeling efficiency, and at the same time, they are more concerned about beautiful raw materials to seek silk quality improvement. Therefore, the silk reelers and silkworm farmers signed a special contract, monopolizing the purchase of raw material cocoons, and the silk reeling industry itself controlled the quality of the cocoons. There are three ways to control: 1. Lending cash to silkworm farmers in advance to prevent farmers from selling the cocoons to outsiders. 2. Make silkworm farmers breed special varieties that are most beneficial to the silk reelers, and 3. Dispatch sericulture instructors to teach certain feeding methods to ensure silk quality improvement. In the third year of the Showa era, the number of silk reeling factories that signed special contracts was 207, and the number of special contract sericulture households was 84.</p>
<p>Recently, the silk price is not a rise in price, but a fundamental fall. Therefore, how to stop the silk price from falling is the most urgent problem for the silk industry at present. The author's control methods:</p>
<p>(1) Silk Price (A) The silk industry jointly cooperates to restrict the sale at a price below a certain level, and prohibits futures market transactions to prevent speculators from manipulating the market, such as the resolutions of the Silk Central Association and the Silk Congress, which can restrict production and pre-lend money for sale at a good price. (B) Banks, etc., give special financial accommodation to silk industry groups, but in order to force the implementation of silk price business, they stop lending money due to silk reeling. (C) The government comes forward to compensate the silk industry for losses, and mediates with banks for the silk industry to obtain loans, and then the government purchases raw silk to raise silk prices.</p>
<p>(2) Cocoon Price (A) The government provides low-interest loans to silkworm farmers to supply basic emergency needs, and issues subsidies to establish cocoon warehouses and joint dry cocoon storage warehouses. (B) The prefectural roads and governments lend money to cocoon markets, cocoon warehouses, and sericulture associations, etc.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the current Japanese silk control law is limited to the four types listed above. Among them, the first and second items have the most significant results. And the reason why there are such results is partly due to the government's promotion, subsidies, and subsidies, and partly due to the people's automatic organization. The future development is in full swing. Looking back at our country, I can't help but feel cold.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and news from all sides was silent. Banks were closed as usual, and there was no market. The market was also very deserted. The interbank lending rate remained the same as before, without any slight change. It is estimated that the early market turnover of eight-point discounted bills was more than 110,000, the new transaction was 700,000 to 800,000, the noon market transaction was more than 300,000, the transaction in the Small General Assembly was more than 500,000, and the money houses received and released more than 29 million foreign public orders. Various remittances were more than 400,000. The market price of auxiliary coins: Jiangnan small foreign currency was 853 yuan in the early market and 853 yuan and 5 jiao in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign currency was 778 yuan and 5 jiao in the early market and 779 yuan in the noon market. The result was that they all differed from the previous day by several jiao. The transaction volume of Jiangjiao was 4,500 jiao in the early market and 6,000 jiao in the noon market. The transaction volume of Guangjiao was 65,000 jiao in the early market and 25,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were changed to a length of 1,500 wen, which is 317,500 wen.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Securities and Public Bonds Were Most Vigorous on Saturday <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Last week (May 29th to June 3rd) in the securities market, Monday was a holiday for the summer festival, and the market was closed for one day. There were only five days of trading, and the trading volume was quite considerable. Although there were a few speculators who wanted to take advantage of the situation due to the northern armistice, it did not hinder the overall situation. The market trading volume and the number of accounts reached more than 30 million, so any slight changes in the situation were enough to cause waves. On Tuesday, the armistice conference was inconclusive, and Feng Yuxiang’s army's attitude made people suspicious. Various firms continued to sell, and the market price fell by one yuan. On Wednesday, the news was dull, and the market saw both rises and falls. On Thursday, the armistice agreement was signed, and short sellers missed the opportunity. Northern firms covered their short positions, and the financial sector absorbed them. The market price rose by 1.23 yuan. The 20-year disaster relief public bond began trading on this day, but there were very few inquiries, and the market price was extremely stable. On Friday, the price continued to rise by half a yuan due to the slight covering of short positions in 38 and 50 numbers. On Saturday, part of the Japanese army withdrew, and various firms began to cover their short positions on a large scale. The financial sector continued to buy, and northern firms were also very enthusiastic. The market price rose sharply, and various bonds repeatedly reached new highs. The upward trend on this day was the most vigorous of the entire week. The Reorganization bonds approached 60 yuan, and the Consolidated Tax bonds broke through 46 yuan. It is not easy to see a sudden drop in the future for the time being. As a result of the week's market prices, the increase ranged from a little over one yuan to a little over three yuan, of which the increase of 3.20 yuan for the Consolidated Six bonds was the largest. The number of transactions totaled 54.12 million yuan, including 42,000 yuan in spot transactions. In futures, the Consolidated Tax bonds accounted for 21.125 million, Reorganization bonds 8.36 million, 1929 Customs bonds 8.2 million, 1920 and 1929 Customs bonds 11.69 million, and the rest ranged from over 100,000 to several hundred thousand.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply came from the numbers 40 and 50. The shops selling Soochow and Tongzhou indica rice and thick Nanhui rice were somewhat slack, but fortunately, the market was stable due to the rain. The price fluctuations were only a few cents. Merchants from Qingpu, Songjiang, and Sijing purchased more than 2,000 packages of thin indica rice from Tianjin and Weihai, and the price was also stable. The price of thin indica rice from Xilian was somewhat increased due to the severe demand from various parties. The situation for Duyang glutinous rice was slightly slack compared to yesterday, and there was no change in price due to the overcast weather.</p>

<p>(The Linping Cocoon Market Concludes) The Linping cocoon market has been open for half a month. Recently, the arrival of goods has decreased, and various firms have not collected enough. The highest cocoon price was 42 yuan, the lowest was 25 yuan, and the average was 32 yuan.</p>
<p>(Lin'an Cocoon Purchases Are Not Weak) This year, the cocoon production in the second model silkworm area of Lin'an is relatively abundant, and the quality of the cocoons is also excellent. The purchases of various firms are not weak, with each family collecting more than 1,000 to 2,000 bundles. The highest price for improved varieties of cocoons is 45 yuan, and the lowest price for local varieties is 24 to 25 yuan.</p>
<p>(Jingjiang Cocoon Production Is Still Good) Although ant farming is not thriving in various towns and villages in Jingjiang this year, the weather is good and the silkworm season is quite good. Cocoon production is still good, and the overall quality is 60% of a normal year. New cocoons have already entered the market. The price for foreign varieties is 35 to 40 yuan, and the price for local varieties is 25 to 30 yuan.</p>
<p>(Silk Waste Shipments Are Not Smooth) The sales of yellow and white silk waste have been sluggish for a long time, and exports are not smooth. Last week, only 284 pieces were shipped to Marseille and other ports via French mail.</p>

<p>"Ah, long time no see."</p>
<p>"Ah, long time no see, how are you?" I ran into K, whom I hadn't seen in years, as I came out of the Sincere Company. He had a triangular belt slung across his shoulder, and the round silver badge of a certain division was displayed, making him look valiant and spirited. Who would believe that he was the famous "fair-faced scholar" from school back then? The changes of the world are truly beyond human control.</p>
<p>"Where have you been all this time? Why haven't I heard from you?"</p>
<p>"After we parted, I did a lot of things. I ate chalk dust, wrote brilliant essays that were 'as instructed,' and finally, with the introduction of a friend, I went to work at the headquarters of a certain division. I'm still there. This time, I came to Shanghai for business."</p>
<p>"Very good, serving on the battlefield. That's what a man should do," I said with admiration and encouragement. "So what is your position?" I knew he wouldn't be shooting guns.</p>
<p>"My position is spreading rumors," he said somberly. "What about serving the country?"</p>
<p>"Military life must be very enjoyable, right?" I wondered why he seemed so depressed.</p>
<p>"Enjoyable? When we're on the move, of course, it's very enjoyable. Wearing the skin of a tyrant, who would dare say 'no'? For example, when our troops arrive in a village and want a few cows or a few girls, it doesn't take much effort. But there are also painful times. Even when we've clearly suffered a defeat, we have to tell people that we killed the enemy bravely, advanced several miles, and captured so many spoils of war. Even when we're clearly retreating, we have to say it's 'for strategic reasons, so...' etc. At this time, the secretary has to think very hard. You see, what we see is the truth, but what we have to say has to be a lie. It's like putting on a smiling face when you're wounded. This pain is hard to bear. I really don't know where the truth has gone. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm dreaming. Alas, I curse this profession of spreading rumors!"</p>

<h3 id="e199">The Case of the Two County Magistrates <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>As the war at the Great Wall began, with a few bangs and crashes of gunfire, the enemy was able to enter the hall and room, and press close to the capital region (this capital region is naturally the old stuff). Speaking from a military perspective, our side, because it was in the vicinity of the suburbs of Tianjin and Beiping, had already set up a "predetermined new defense line". The various defending armies, for "military strategy reasons", had no choice but to retreat rapidly, in order to achieve the concentrated formation of the "predetermined new defense line". Therefore, the enemy's ability to follow and advance was not because of their victorious attacks, but rather our side's respectful demonstration of peaceful sincerity, and the winning strategy of seeking benevolence and gaining benevolence. Helplessly, the civil officials ultimately couldn't see through the mysteries of the military officials. Feng Chengdi, the county magistrate of Tongxian, a vital town in eastern Hebei (only 40 li away from Beiping), was as foolish as a country bumpkin who didn't understand how a revolving lantern works. He dared to mistakenly believe that the national army had fought a losing battle, so he implemented the best of the thirty-six stratagems and ran away into the depths of the white clouds, leaving people unaware of his whereabouts for as long as a week.</p>
<p>Following this, the chief of the public security bureau, the director of the finance bureau, the county party headquarters, and other important personnel in other important organs, naturally imitated and enjoyed congratulating each other on the "joy of moving house". As a result, no one was in charge of the city, the order was in chaos, and the prisoners in the prison also took the opportunity to break out and escape. Chairman He, the chairman of the military sub-committee, then appointed a new county magistrate, Zhang Qijun, to come to Tongxian to take office. Just as the new county magistrate was beginning to carry out the first step of his virtuous policy of "stabilizing the people's hearts and restoring commerce", it was suddenly discovered that the old county magistrate was also continuing to work as usual in Sanjianfang, 20 li west of Beiping. From then on, with a sudden crash, the strange tale of the "case of the two county magistrates" spread far and wide, and the confusing and elusive "double envelope case" would also lose its exclusive right from this point forward.</p>
<p>This case was discovered on May 25th. "Monks have their own sutras, Taoists have their own books." It is said that it has not yet been resolved. I will rashly set up a joint trial court, and also take on the duties of a lawyer entrusted by both parties, and am willing to provide free defense as follows.</p>
<p>On the plaintiff's side, the county magistrate is the ruler of a county, and his every move is related to the governance or chaos of the area, and the safety or danger of the people. In this serious situation, the responsibility should be increased, and he should "die in his duty" and not abandon the city and run away. Now that the new county magistrate has been ordered to come here to take office, the old county magistrate should quickly transfer all seals, files, and especially the silver and funds, and immediately hand them over properly, and await thorough investigation and handling, etc.</p>
<p>On the defendant's side, the old county magistrate's term had not yet expired, and the new county magistrate suddenly came to take office, which violated regulations. The responsibility should be borne by the other party. Furthermore, the old county magistrate, in order to preserve the important documents of the county government, so as to maintain tax revenue in the future, had no choice but to avoid the dangerous city and temporarily work at the "new location" of Sanjianfang. This was originally a "predetermined plan" and not a hasty escape. He was planning to return to the county government within a few days to clean up the remaining matters, but unexpectedly, the superiors did not investigate and suddenly appointed a new official, which disappointed my hard work. It is hoped that Lord He will have foresight, withdraw the order, then the locality will be fortunate, and I will be fortunate, etc.</p>
<p>Listening to these two lawyers' free defense, which is "well-founded and reasonable", it can be seen that this "case of the two county magistrates" is ultimately not like the dispute in the "double envelope case", which can be resolved with a single look in the demon-revealing mirror. However, there is nothing in the world that cannot be resolved. Even the dangerous situation in Tianjin and Beiping is like this. One side said "determined to take it" and the other side said "betting everything on the city", but in fact, haven't both sides already been tip-toeing around, like a lonely widower and a grieving widow, privately resolving their matters?</p>

<p>"A lot? I've got even more!" Old Huang showed off his artistic skin in the same way.</p>
<p>In our school, because it's been hot these days, and there are so many students living on campus, and the dormitory facilities are so simple and unhygienic, the annoying bedbugs are rampant in the beds and mats. The above is a conversation between two students about the rampant bedbugs.</p>
<p>Old Huang and Little Zhang talked for a while, and inspired by the poetry, he couldn't help but pick up a piece of chalk and write a sleeping poem on the blackboard. The poem goes:</p>
<p>"Spring sleep doesn't know dawn, bedbugs bite everywhere; the sound of scratching at night, how many itchy welts do you know?"</p>
<p>Old Huang laughed first, and then Little Zhang also laughed. They even forgot the pain caused by all the bedbugs on their bodies and laughed!</p>

<h3 id="e202">Eulogy for the Transition of Spring and Summer <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Kuangbei</p>
<p>Spring has already slipped away amid the unexpected cold. The atmosphere of human affairs seems to have been affected by it. This year's spring is so abnormal! Continuous spring rains and unexpected spring chills almost entirely occupied a period of this spring. Now it is "flowers fall and water flows, spring departs," leaving only a poet's heart of remembrance. No, it only offers the opportunity for liberation, regardless of the boys who come to dance. As for me, feeling the arrival of summer, in this "the spring scenery is gone, who knows where" situation, the weather is gradually turning hot. Lying in a room like a steamer, I won't be able to breathe, and it will lower my efficiency - that's no fun.</p>
<p>However, these are ultimately small matters. We must open our eyes and look at the prelude ahead:</p>
<p>The unlucky spring did not bring us the bright spring we hoped for. The gentle spring breeze and lovely spring scenery, at the beginning of its opening, brought the bad news of the enemy's further encroachment and, in a gloomy atmosphere, took away our naturally fortified Jehol Province. Are we to blame the generals who guarded the land for not trying their best? That is unavoidable injustice. Heaven's will is already so favorable to them and unfavorable to us. What more can be said?</p>
<p>Now summer has arrived. History tells us that China can not only be called "Zhina" but also "Huaxia." There was an ancient fool who passed his home three times without entering - the Xia Dynasty's Yu the Great - who diligently settled the mountains and rivers, obtaining vast plains and a beautiful land, but which was treated by later generations like a piece of stinking, rotten meat, worthless, ceded piece by piece to others, developing into a world where "barbarians corrupt China."</p>
<p>Now summer has arrived. "The scorching sun in the sky" is summer's only characteristic, and it also symbolizes "the tyrant's sun is upon us." I hear that when the scorching sun is in the sky, young gentlemen and ladies have electric fans to drive away the heat, and are lazily unconcerned. The poor masses can also take off their shirts and take a round fan, and "flap, flap" to make wind, so it is not difficult to breathe a cool breath. However, "the tyrant's sun is upon us," what plan will be made?</p>
<p>What I am most concerned about are the officials, the wealthy elders, and in this summer's divine arrival, even with electric fans at their side, they can't help but shout repeatedly: "Hot, hot, hot!" So, there will be elegant acts of seeking secluded places to escape the heat, which will be enough to relax the chest, broaden the mind, and prolong life. Beidaihe, Yangquan, Jehol... all of these are beautiful summer resorts. Now that these beautiful rivers and mountains have mostly fallen into the hands of the enemy, how can we not sigh helplessly, "where to escape the summer?" Lushan, Guling, and Moganshan will probably hang up "full" signs. Qingdao is still acceptable, but Qinhuangdao is also impossible to go to.</p>
<p>Now summer has arrived, and in this opening month of May for summer, even leaf by leaf of bloody history is churning. "May Third," "May Seventh," "May Ninth," "May Thirtieth," were all gifts of this summer, ornaments of the season. The people of the country must not forget them. I hear that they are going to hold mournful commemorations. The ordinary, idle officials will have to bother, bother, to bow three times before the portrait of our Premier, and maybe there will be a sorrowful sermon.</p>
<p>The schools will still have holidays according to regulations. The students and compatriots who shout the loudest for national salvation will be overjoyed by three hundred, unable to contain their joy. Dancing can be linked to national salvation, and XX can also be linked to national salvation. Look, the carousing and dancing, movies and amusements at sea, how much will they turn the opportunity and develop their businesses because of this.</p>
<p>A eulogy says: "What does the country have to do with me? What need is there to save it? Would it not be better to rest?"</p>

<p>Several Different Kinds of Questions</p>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>My circumstances are very poor. I only received two years of junior high school education before dropping out. This spring, I came to Shanghai and became a small shop clerk in a store. Now, I have several matters I would like to ask you about, hoping for your guidance. (A) I feel that my Chinese proficiency is somewhat lacking, making it difficult to deal with social situations effectively. I would like to study Chinese language further. I don't know what books I should buy to read. (B) We should also acquire some basic legal knowledge. I would also like to buy some common legal books to read, but I don't know which ones would be good. (C) Hunan is currently issuing national salvation bonds, with the amount subscribed based on the amount of property owned. My family's property is less than five thousand yuan, but there are one or two local bullies in the town who insist that my family's property is worth more than ten thousand yuan and that we should subscribe to the bond based on that amount. My uncle has requested the county government to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure fairness, but the government and the bullies are in cahoots and refuse to grant my uncle's request. My uncle is at his wit's end, and the matter remains unresolved, causing me great anxiety. I implore you, sir, to help me think of a solution. (D) When my late grandfather was alive, he privately established a charity. It owns over eighty acres of land, and all the income from it has been used for local charitable causes over the years. In addition to paying the regular land tax and local surcharges, should it be responsible for other levies and donations? I respectfully inquire.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Yang Suyun (May 29th)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The path of Chinese language is profound and mysterious, truly without end. However, apart from those few with literary genius and whose circumstances allow for in-depth study, most people only need to have clear and smooth writing, with words that can convey meaning sufficiently for practical use. Judging from your letter, it is reasonably fluent, but when encountering slightly more complex matters or slightly more convoluted meanings, there is inevitably the difficulty of words not adequately expressing your thoughts. It is, of course, good to be open to learning; however, since you are already employed in society, the time you can devote to self-study each day must be limited, and there is so much that a person should study. Therefore, we advise you not to buy several books specifically for studying Chinese language. Fortunately, Chinese people have many opportunities to come into contact with Chinese language, such as the daily newspapers, various valuable magazines, and books introducing various types of knowledge. They can all express very complex matters and very convoluted meanings using very concise words. You only need to carefully understand them while reading, asking yourself whether you could write the same matter or the same meaning as clearly and distinctly. In this way, you can gain a lot of knowledge, and your Chinese proficiency can also improve imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Basic legal knowledge is indeed something that every citizen of a country governed by law should know. Now, I will introduce a few valuable books that I can think of at the moment. (1) "Legal Knowledge," edited by Guo Wei and published by Huiwentang, is worth buying and reading. The content of this book is not very rich, but it provides a reasonable introduction to each area of the law, and it can also provide insights into legal research. Therefore, for people who have never read a law book, it is most suitable to read it first. (2) "General Principles of Criminal Law" (3) "Specific Principles of Criminal Law." These two books are also published by Huiwentang and edited by lawyer Guo Wei. They provide not only a very detailed analysis of the "Criminal Law of the Republic of China" but also discuss its merits and demerits based on legal theory, making them essential reading. As for civil law, procedural law, and others, they are either too complex or not the basic knowledge necessary for the average citizen. I will not introduce them one by one. Fortunately, the book "Legal Knowledge" provides appropriate book recommendations. If you are interested in in-depth study, you can buy them and study them according to its guidance.</p>
<p>If citizens feel that their country truly has admirable aspects, then when national crises arise, they will naturally donate generously and devote themselves to the cause of national salvation. Sadly, in China over the past few decades, the general population has been made somewhat averse to the country by the perverse actions of the ruling authorities, making it difficult for patriotism to arise. Therefore, the fact that these national salvation bonds are being issued through the method of forced contributions is already extremely pitiful. However, it can still be said that national crises are unavoidable; if those who are implementing the policy still engage in underhanded dealings, acting unfairly and illegally, then the public's view of the nation will become increasingly disappointing day by day. Therefore, this matter not only affects the burden on individual families but also indirectly harms the future of the country. This matter should be resisted to the death. If they use the power of the government to oppress you, then you can only resort to prayer.</p>
<p>As for privately established charitable organizations, they are legally referred to as "corporate foundations" and have the same status as "natural persons." Therefore, they have a general obligation to bear all public duties equally.</p>

<p>Twenty-Two. The Two Giants</p>
<p>A familiar car horn sounded outside the door. Wu Gui carefully went to open the door himself. It turned out to be Minister Su and a guest. This guest was Mr. Gu, the manager of the Taiwan Bank, whom Wu Gui also knew very well.</p>
<p>They got out of the car one after the other. The master's satin robe even dragged on the running board. Only Manager Gu was wearing a black suit, so of course, it wouldn't drag on the running board, but the tall black top hat bumped against the car roof.</p>
<p>It was already ten o'clock in the evening, and they were still happily running over, undoubtedly having danced a lot in the ballroom. This was because Manager Gu had always loved socializing with foreigners, so all his actions had become Westernized. As soon as he entered the hall, the master asked repeatedly:</p>
<p>"Where's Madam? Where's Madam? Where did she go?"</p>
<p>"She said that the master wasn't coming again, and she was bored, so she went to see a movie."</p>
<p>Wu Gui stood cautiously to the side, answering. The master smiled and glanced at Manager Gu, snorting through his nose, looking as if he wasn't very happy. Then, Manager Gu said playfully: "I didn't expect Geng Weng to still have peach blossom luck in his old age. Look, as soon as you don't come, that peerless beauty will..."</p>
<p>"...inevitably be bored, truly pitiful."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, nonsense!"</p>
<p>Happy laughter, triumphant laughter, but also a wink at Wu Gui. Wu Gui naturally understood the rules of the officialdom and immediately retreated respectfully. However, he didn't dare run too far away, lest there be a need to serve tea or water and no one would respond. He had no choice but to wait quietly outside the door. However, he could still hear the sound of their conversation from the crack in the door. But they were speaking very quietly, and Manager Gu was speaking Japanese, so Wu Gui was naturally at a loss. However, there were sometimes Chinese words mixed in, such as "treaty" and "plan." Wu Gui naturally assumed that they were confidential national matters, and he didn't need to inquire about them. But his master was speaking Mandarin, but also very quietly, and it was difficult to hear clearly. As far as Wu Gui knew, Minister Su could not only speak Japanese but also French. However, he didn't speak them, probably because he was old and didn't want to bother. Of course, foreign languages were never as convenient as his native language. However, Wu Gui still carefully eavesdropped on a few sentences:</p>
<p>"...this point is exactly the same as what I meant: I believe that if we can merge and establish a country according to this plan, it will indeed surprise the white race. If Asia truly unites... But this matter always feels difficult to implement. At the same time, this amount of activity funding is still not enough..."</p>
<p>Wu Gui didn't understand what it meant. Looking at the pocket watch on his body, it was already eleven forty-five. Madam should be back. So he immediately went to the door and told the gatekeeper:</p>
<p>"You must guard carefully. When Madam comes back, you must tell her that the master is waiting inside, tell her to..."</p>
<p>"...go in through the door in Mr. Zhang's opium den. Did you hear clearly?"</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Possibilities for Wealthy Women on the Silver Screen <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Nan</p>
<p>To Become a Star, One Must Work Hard and Strive for Self-Improvement</p>
<p>Wealthy Women Lack the Spirit to Strive</p>
<p>Can wealthy women become stars on the silver screen? This is a question that requires much thought. Working under carbon arc lights certainly offers not only substantial monetary income but also fame that overflows the universe. Therefore, many people believe that those who enter the film industry do not necessarily come solely for profit but also for fame. Those without money come for money, but those with money can also come for fame. This sounds very reasonable, but in fact, it is not. Wealthy women, on a whim, run to Hollywood. However, even those who possess not only the power of money and the splendor of clothing but also beautiful faces and graceful figures have failed. What is the reason? Acting is not easy. One must not only work hard and diligently but also endure the temper of directors and colleagues, refining oneself for years before becoming a luminary. Therefore, women without money look at the stars who have already made a name for themselves, earning tens of thousands in salaries, and they are filled with envy and encourage themselves to climb upwards cautiously, gradually rising above others and becoming stars. As for wealthy women, firstly, they are used to comfort and naturally cannot temper their bodies and strive for advancement. Secondly, they do not lack money and naturally do not envy the large salaries of others, lacking a forward-driving force.</p>
<p>As for talented actresses, they are naturally another matter. However, where do so many geniuses come from who do not need to go through training? It's just that some women are smarter and advance faster than others, so everyone calls them "geniuses." Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, and Joan Crawford, weren't they all trained?</p>
<p>Now, there is a new actress in Hollywood named Adrienne Ames. She abandoned her wealthy family and ran to Hollywood, determined to become a star. She carefully analyzed the various reasons for the past failures of wealthy women in Hollywood. She understood the harm of having money and strived for advancement. Now, she is gradually showing her talent and has become a supporting actress for Shepherd. She herself said that she came to Hollywood not because of a whim but because she wanted to be self-reliant and make a difference. She can continue to work without stopping because of small achievements, so her future is very promising. However, when she first arrived in Hollywood, who didn't treat her as a rich dilettante? Who would seriously consider her intentions?</p>
<p>Before entering the film industry, Adrienne was already famous in New York society. Her husband was a well-known broker on Wall Street and very wealthy. However, her first marriage was a complete failure. Perhaps the pain she suffered in her first marriage had strengthened her resolve to pursue a career in film, so that even the happiness of her second marriage could not dissuade her! This is extremely admirable.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e207">Review of "The Woman Accused" <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>If we are in frequent contact with American films, then it is easy to discover that the film artists of this golden country often do not give much thought to the structure of the story, but instead strive to flaunt their wealth and luxury on the screen. It can also be said that this is the characteristic of American films.</p>
<p>Taking this "The Woman Accused" as an example, it is not difficult to find ample confirmation. A young woman, Granda, is preparing to marry her fiancé on a ship. Her old lover obstructs her by threatening to have his gunman kill her fiancé and immediately phones the gunman. Obviously, this is illogical. Can you discuss the secret of murder over the phone? At that time, the young woman, filled with anger and hatred, struck him with a bronze statue, killing him. Afterwards, the woman told her maid the truth. The maid, disregarding the fact that she herself would be implicated, helped the woman escape. This is also very forced. I don't believe there is a loyal servant who would be so fearless of death. Later, a friend of the deceased sought justice on his behalf, proving that Granda was indeed the murderer. However, the court refused to accept the case, saying that the evidence was insufficient. This is truly making fun of the solemn law. Can the law sometimes show great mercy and allow criminals to roam free? Of course, this is because the screenwriter is too sentimental and must ensure that "lovers will always be united." But wouldn't it be more moving to have a tragic ending for this so-called happy marriage? Although it was proven that the deceased had "conspired to murder," shouldn't the one who committed "manslaughter" be sentenced to a few years in prison? As mentioned above, we are not advocating for their laws, but we want to point out their contradictions.</p>
<p>However, the entire picture shows that the acting skills are already pure and skilled. Director BAYARD VEILLER has used the entire plot very vividly, making us feel not at all stagnant. There are luxurious sets and beautiful cinematography. In particular, the swimming scene on the ship, the director wants to show off their wealthy lifestyle to the fullest. Of course, this is a necessary condition for Golden Country movies, but it is also their ugly exposure. As for the young woman's fiancé, using force to whip the deceased's murderer, is a very good scene. At the same time, this makes the plot take a sharp turn, which is naturally a clever technique. However, the important twists and turns are all explained through dialogue, so for viewers who do not understand English, it will inevitably reduce their interest to some extent.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Review of "Flames" <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Shi</p>
<p>If we want to find an adjective to describe the passion between men and women, then "fire," FLAME, is indeed a quite suitable word. Perhaps there are better words to symbolize passion, but the film "Flames" is completely matched with fire.</p>
<p>The plot of the film is briefly described as follows: Two firefighters meet because they rescued a cat from a telephone pole for two young women. Who knew that these two gentlemen would fall in love with the two women at first sight and try to approach them. So, after several conversations, plus watching movies and visiting the park, one pair has already succeeded, while the other pair is half-hearted. Although the man is as passionate as fire, the woman is threatened and enticed by her manager, and she resents her lover's rudeness. Later, due to a fire in the OFFICE, the manager is grateful to the firefighter lover for saving his life, and this young couple gets married from then on.</p>
<p>In terms of the structure of the story, there are inevitably places that are too "coincidental," such as the sudden fire in this particular office, and the woman in the flames just happens to be waiting for her lover to come and rescue her. (Because before the lover arrived, there was already a fire truck, but they didn't save people first and only cared about putting out the fire. Of course, maybe these are all inevitable in fictional stories.) However, we don't have to have any extravagant expectations for these, because filmmakers are not necessarily realists. As for calling a fire truck for a cat, and not hesitating to drill into the flames for a bird, it is also an interpolation that is beyond reason and makes people dare not believe it. However, according to the dialogue, it tells us that it is ridiculing the fact that the firefighters' lives are not as good as a bird (because someone fell to their death for the bird), then we can only shake our heads and sigh.</p>
<p>The two fire scenes, before and after, are indeed very good-looking. Red fire, black smoke, women's cries for help, the roar of fire trucks, the trampling crowd, and the firefighters' desperate efforts make us viewers feel as if we are there, excited and tense. However, the director's description of so-called "familiarity" is very insufficient. If we compare it to a big fire, then obviously this "youthful fire" is not at all intense. In fact, this young couple is not passionate, and as for the insertion of jokes, there is nothing brilliant. Especially when the flames are at their highest at the end, the firefighter doesn't go to put out the fire but instead kisses the woman wildly, which is simply too unreasonable. His manager apologizes to his love rival immediately after being rescued, which is also too stiff.</p>
<p>Regarding the performance, there is nothing particularly good, but the relatively comical female character can give people an unforgettable impression. But if the camera were more agile, then the photography would definitely be better. In short, the performance of this film does not disappoint people too much, if we also need intense flames to stimulate our nerves.</p>
<h3 id="e209">United Star Film Company's Debut Film "Crossroads" to Begin Filming <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jing</p>
<p>In this "Film Year" of 1933, the changes in filmmaking style and the organization of film companies are rising like the wind and surging like clouds, making it very lively. It is indeed an excellent phenomenon for the domestic film industry.</p>
<p>The reporter would like to introduce the various emerging film companies of this year, thinking that this must be what the readers like most.</p>
<p>United Star Film Company was organized by Wang Chunzhe and the famous playwright Lu Shijun. The company's address is on Route Saypoo. The debut film is called "Crossroads," directed by Lu Shijun himself. The script was written by Hou Fengjun and is a microcosm of modern society. It is said that the content is very substantial, with a mine as the backdrop, which is also the first domestic film to use a mine as the backdrop. It is very worthy of our attention. The important roles in the play are played by Zheng Junli, Yuan Congmei, Tang Huaiqiu, etc. Filming has now begun.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Laurel and Hardy's New Film <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Zhong</p>
<p>The new film "The Kevils Brothers" by the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy has been completed. The film is based on Auber's opera. Stars such as Dennis King, Thurman Dude, and James Tornelison all make cameo appearances in the film. The director is Hall Roach of MGM.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Universal Studios Holds National Campus Beauty Contest <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Lun</p>
<p>Universal Studios recently used the pages of "School Humor" and "Consciousness" magazines to hold a national campus beauty contest. Any female college student with beauty and acting talent can participate. The method is to send two photos, one profile and one front view, and a letter from the school authorities or the head of the drama department certifying the student's acting skills and vocal range. Participants must also provide details of their age, height, weight, eye color, hair color, dramatic experience, etc. The first-place winner will be given the title of "All-American Girl." She will also play the lead role in an upcoming football film, with salary and treatment based on star qualifications. In addition, she will be given a free trip to Hawaii and a weekly salary of at least one hundred US dollars during her vacation. Universal Studios has previously shot two football films, one being THE SPIREL OF NOTRE DAME ALL-AMERICAN. This special selection of the most beautiful campus beauty in the country to play the lead role in the third football film will undoubtedly have a great appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e212">An Overview of Soviet Russian Cinema (8) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Rudolf Mesu, Translated by Bao Han</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian film industry has a strong tendency to advance and is constantly planning and experimenting. However, the famous saying regarding art in the past is no longer valued in the current Soviet Russian film and theater circles. Film and theater are also not concerned about art itself. At present, Soviet Russia prioritizes education and propaganda, and art is its slave. If abstract art or artistic works can be used for propaganda, they will be used to the fullest extent. Once they lose their use, they will be discarded as if they were filth.</p>
<p>The Yerkov Film Studio is currently engaged in the production of DON QUIXOTE. This play is a performance costume film, and the content of the film's story is not much different from the original book. In terms of propaganda, there is no need to add or delete anything from the original book. However, the Kamerny Theatre in Moscow greatly adapted Shakespeare's HAMLET this spring in order to suit the Soviet sales market, resulting in a great discrepancy between the drama performed and the original text. For example, it was said that Hamlet's killing of Claudius had no personal intention but was an act of revolution, wanting to eliminate an evil oppressor for the poor, and so on. Furthermore, in order to emphasize this meaning, it was said that the ghost in the play was completely fabricated by Hamlet in order to deceive the army and launch a major campaign together.</p>
<p>The Russians are quite willing to cite historical events within a considerable scope, but they also rely on whether these events can have much relationship with the general spirit of the Five-Year Plan. For example, Shakespeare's play "Romeo and Juliet," the essence of which is extremely romantic, has no use for Soviet Russia. This idea has been repeatedly stated in Soviet Russian film and theater circles, and I myself have personally heard it said repeatedly by people in the film, theater, and book circles.</p>
<p>As for another famous work by Shakespeare, such as OTHELLO, a famous Soviet Russian producer once told me that the modern substitute for this play is LA COCUE MAGNIFIQUE. Although this play is an unproven Belgian work, it has actually been able to replace the masterpiece of a great master on the Russian stage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "Carmen" still has a continued existence in modern Soviet Russia. I dare not say whether the plot of "Carmen" conforms to the spirit of the Five-Year Plan. Furthermore, the modern production of Bizet's opera has not undergone any modifications. We have no way of determining the reason for its success or failure, so we can only say that "Carmen" and others are like the works of Hal Roach, accidentally mixed in the film industry and have become firmly established over the years. Judging from the daily actions of Carmen and Hal Roach, my words are also quite appropriate. (The End)</p>
