<p>報告書草案全部通過十九特委會</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯秘書長德魯蒙奉十九國特委會諭、今日訪日總代表松岡洋右提出警告、謂日本對熱河之任何軍事行動、均足使氣息僅屬之調解努力感覺困難、務請日本政府予以嚴重注意、（十五日晨三時半中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）刻聞英外部次官艾登在星期六起草委員會通過報告書與建議之前、曾表示將向政府請訓、頃艾登已接英政府訓令、命在今日下午十九國委員會内勿提保留、現各國代表已公開坦直討論日本拒絶建議案後之應取手續、均認届時第一步當諮詢美俄、確悉英對於壓迫東京使接受建議一層所願合作之程度、此項諮詢係根據建議中最後一節邀請非會員圑恊同行動之規定辦理，惟必須遲至美國新總統羅斯福就任以後也、國聯領袖人物預料施於東京之壓力、將可依據於九國公約第一欵或凱洛格非戰公約第二欵或國聯盟約第十欵及第十一欵、但寗以依據九國公約與非戰公約爲愈、藉免有請美國恊助施行盟約之必要、又可注意者、國聯雖力避提及盟約第十六欵、但承認十六欵内所規定之一切　裁行動、不必提出、該欵亦幾可完全實行、一般諳悉時局内幕者、則多料日本初時縱拒絶國聯建議，將來施以壓力後、將可迫日本逐漸接受建議、允開談判、因此衆覺起草委員會幾經周折而後商定之談判委員會、將來俟日本稍受經濟壓力後、當可實現云、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本之覆文、今晨已送交秘書長德魯蒙、果如所料、覆文對於國聯之詢問並未有切實答覆、惟重伸前言、謂不反對將李頓報告書第九章所載原則列入草議案中、而附以適用此原則時須顧慮時事實際發展之諒解、覆文又言及日本之温和的立場、謂日政府深信維持［滿洲國］獨立之承認、乃遠東和平之唯一擔保、全部問題須以此爲根據、而由中日兩國解决之云、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會今日午後三時三十分集議時、即將討論日本特委會所詢［滿洲國］承認事之覆文、並將决定予以何種之全答復、有數委員對於熱河事表示憾忱、大　此種情感將於至日覆文中見之、預料致日覆文措詞較諸秘書長德魯蒙松岡談話時所用者更爲嚴峻、（十四路透）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會今日已告成滿案之報告書、衆料日本與國聯將因此書實行决裂、聞日本總代表松岡曾通告國聨秘書長長魯蒙、謂日本不欲停止對熱河之軍事行動、［滿洲國］政府準備恊同日軍肅清熱河省所有之華軍云、（十三日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本十九特委會之覆文、關於中國在滿主權之訽問者、今日已到日内瓦大約明日可送交秘書長德魯蒙、聞覆文重述日本之立塲、對於特委會所發之問語、並未切實答覆、故特委會或將於明日午後完成其報告書之討論、而通過建議案、並召集國聯大會於星期一日期開會、届時大會定可通過此報告書與建議案也、雖有數方面意謂在大會未有决議時、調解門户依然開放、但衆覺關於特委會目前之態度、調解門户現覆關閉、因日本覆文對於特委會所訽問者、現未與以切實答覆也、據特委會許多委員之意見、如日本果接受十二月十五日决議案之原議、而删去邀請非會員國加入一節、並附以理由說明書第五節下之保留、則國聯反將處於進退維谷之窘困地位、今日本旣拒絶此决議案、一般人咸料日本必不接受此建議案、但後事之趨向如何、則輿論各執一說、據研究國聯盟約負責方面謂此報告書通過日起三個月後、如日軍仍在中國境内、則當然　破壞盟約之舉動、中國可請求實施盟約第十六條下之制裁、無論如可、下星期一日國聯大會之會議、定當有驚人發展、（十三日路透電）</p>

<p>第一段</p>
<p>甲　解决必須依照國聯盟約·非戰公約·及九國公約、</p>

<h3 id="c15">爲蘇聯考察圑進一言穗 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>當中蘇復交之初。吾人即撰評主張組織蘇聯考察圑。對於蘇聯一切作正面之考察。昨據報載實業部爲明瞭中蘇商務情形。並考察蘇聯第一次五年計劃成功後國内工商業發展槪况。藉資參考起見。擬組織一蘇聯工商業考察圑。赴蘇實際考察工商業。同時國内實業界多數領袖。亦鑒於我國實業幼稚有借銳於友邦之必要。特發起組織蘇聯考察圑。前往考察。且期於到蘇之後。能與彼邦經界人物交換關於兩國經濟現狀之知識。此兩種組織。吾人自當力表贊同。蓋吾人認此爲我國領袖人士决然立於蘇聯之正面。對蘇聯之真面目。作親切之透視之第一次。亦即自此次中蘇復交以後。中蘇兩民族開始互通欵曲之第一聲其意義實不止於藉以［明瞭中蘇商務情形。及考察蘇聯工商業槪况］而已也。</p>
<p>不過吾人於考察圑今茲尚正在進行組織之先。亦願略責其愚見</p>
<p>第一吾人認爲考察圑之組織。其目的固不應僅在於游歷。亦不應僅在於［明瞭中蘇商務情形。并考察蘇聯工商業發展槪况。］蓋關於工商業之一般技術問題。如管理工廠。如技術訓練。如厲行生產合理化。如競奪市塲。累積利潤之種種知識。歐美產業先進國家早已明白予吾人以指示。并供給吾人·以極明晰之典型。今日固不必長途跋涉。轉而求之於此新興之邦。</p>
<p>第二吾人認爲世人對於蘇聯之觀察。多常存主觀之偏見。惟［偏］乃不明。惟主觀乃常故意朦蔽事實。一切主觀之毁譽。恰給予世人以不正確之認識。使蘇聯之真相愈堕入五里霧中。同時亦惟先存主觀。觀察者之本身。對於蘇聯乃亦根本不能有所獲得。肆詞毁譽。尤根本與蘇聯無關。故此次考察圑於前往蘇聨之前。必先去其着色之眼鏡。去其主觀之見解。以純客觀之態度。作最精密之視察。庶能認取蘇聯之真相。庶能收穫正確之知識。</p>
<p>第三吾人認爲此次考察圑前往蘇聯。所最應着目者。尤爲在蘇聯之領域中。旣無失業之工人。亦無流浪無依之人。舉凡蘇聯之國民。無論其爲工人。爲農民。爲婦女。爲兒童。皆克儘量發揮其創造力。以建設蘇聯新國家。并鞏固其碁礎。抑且每個人都充滿生命之活力。反之。在另一方面。則歐美各國正無不爲日益激漲之失業狂潮所苦悶。要求麵包要求工作之呼聲。震撼山嶽金融家與企業家都惟有　首焦灼。無法應付。此種恰立於相反地位之對照。不啻說明蘇聯爲立於此凋蔽世界之外。然而蘇聯固仍存在於此同一之世界也。全世界凋蔽。獨蘇聯繁榮。其因何居。吾人則深盼考察圑能作切實之考察。爲吾人解答此宇宙之大謎。</p>
<p>考察蘇聯。爲對於我國最有意義最有裨益之舉動。今工商界已開始組織考察圑矣。吾人更深盻各界繼起而踵期後。</p>

<p>春秋破冰輪  瞻廬　　丨打開北極冰洋易　　丨融化人間意見難　　蘇俄的破冰輪［亞力山大　比拉可夫］號，建立有史以來輪船打破北冰洋航路的第一功。船長莫羅令富有冒險的天才，從前人類所不　通過的地方。都被他通過了；宜乎破冰輪到了星嘉坡，得到星洲人士盛大的歡迎。　　北極亘古不融的堅冰，可以設法打開一條航行的路；但是，民國締造以來各派領袖的意見之冰，竟沒有法子可以打破，便算偶爾打破了，一　眼重又凍結的比北冰洋　得堅固！二十餘年來的内戰不息，便是打不破這條意見之冰啊！有形的冰易破，無形的冰難化；縐兩句［常言道俗前］的詩，呌做；打開北冰洋易，融化人間意見難。　　最近，根據新大陸詩家谷消息：該處化學恊會，邀請工程學院敎授惠羅實愽士演講未來世界，愽士稱：［現世界是冰時代的終期，吾人可希望南北兩極的冰山逐漸融化了，大約經了一千年的過程，兩極的冰山可以盡化爲一片汪洋；其時，空中的雲氣當比現代稀薄，地球上接受陽光的機會校多，一切暴雨疾風都可以不作了；］云云。愽士的測騐果然一一正確，這　是個融和世界了！料想一千年後意見之冰，也可以隨着兩極之冰而融化了！但是，一千年的悠久過程，［俟河之清，人壽幾何］呢？矣！前奏  人英　　丨靑春的活躍丨　　在鼓樂聲中，春之神傳播了幸福的果子；給全世界幸福的人羣。冬的嚴威歛跡了，銀白的雪花也溶解在和煦的春光中。一般年靑的朋友，也復燃起靑春的熱力；在追求着一切美的事物。他們也像池塘的游魚，曝露出靑春的活躍。這裏沒有被籠罩在灰暗命運中的詩人，在讚揚着雪的偉大；梅的貞潔。祗有活躍的一羣，在追求着牡丹的富麗，桃色的希冀。春之神給予了靑年們火的力，這力量，可以燃起了民族的復興的光燄，　　隔絶都市最近的外灘公園中，這裏是又顯現着蓬勃的氣象了。衰頽的殘枝，被了陽光的照耀；萌發了它的新條。枯黄的草原，也露出復興的種子。一對對年靑的情侶，天國的夏娃與亞當，銀河的牛郎與織女，又在缘林蔭處白花叢中，跳躍着他們靑春的影子。留不住的韶光，回憶從前此地，也聽到甜蜜的情話：沉醉了我的靈魂。在那背景幽絶的假山邊旁，也留下了我靑春的影子。　　異國情調的法國少女，母性典型的英國少婦，又伴着伊的情侶，携着黎明時期的小生命，一隊隊充塞在公園的道上。江水泛濫地流過，也带着脈脈的眷意。沉溺在冬的公園，是揭開了新的序幕。將有　旎的艷聞，幸福的巧遇，無論它是罪惡的幸運的，留待天才的作家們，來抒情，來發揮。在這裏，我先寫下了它的前奏。弗甘作僞帝之親貴  賢賢　　丨愧愧儡而羞漢賊丨　　滿洲國大執政，三等傀儡，溥儀先生的令弟媳唐石霞女士，據報載，新近由滬寄信給一位在北平的清貴，（前清的貴胄，後清的貴族，）中間有二句道，［寗願爲華夏之孤魂，弗甘作僞帝之親貴］。這二句，說得何等沉痛，同堅守榆關的軍士們說的，［不怕敵軍的飛機大砲，只怕退却令］。一様的可歌可泣，萬古不滅。可惜這不辨是血是淚的話，說得遲了數千年，沒趕上司馬遷先生寫進史記裏。可惜孔老夫子未曾假我數年，否則材料旣多，或許不至擱筆得那麽早，而呂東萊也可多寫幾篇酣暢淋漓的愽議大文章，給我們我生也晚的後生小子，點頭播腦的念念有辭。　　本來，像曾經貴爲天子的溥儀先生，寄食長春，自己說還夠不上稱傀儡，只好算當了一名看印官，那麽，自　以下，雖爲清貴，大高而不妙，也就可想而知。論理，所謂大執政也者，雖然是私生子式的滿洲國的大統領，但是所謂滿清國也者，旣蒙一等强國大日本一番美意，公然承認了，那麽，最低的限度，滿洲國大執政，也應受萬民尊敬了。但是事實告訴我們，這位溥大執政的起居生活，正像在扮演曹操逼宮那一齣戲裏的漢獻帝，處處承日人的美意，保護得萬分周密。大執政生活都像坐牢，請想，再奔去攀龍附鳳，啃肉骨頭，有甚麽味兒？　　這位唐石霞女士，在這［傀儡不知羞，漢奸滿街走］的今日，能夠看得分明，立得定主意，不去隨波逐流，眞可算是一位頂天立地的奇女子，愧殺一般傀儡鬚眉，羞殺一般漢奸男子。陽九之厄  春秋　　日本人眞奇怪，和一個［八］字很有緣分，但瞧他們九一八在瀋陽發難，一二八在上海搗亂，好像特地看中了這［八］字似的。但是他命中註定不能和［九］［字碰頭，一碰了頭就　，所以一二八厄於十九路軍，目前又厄於國聯的九人小組委員會，終於還跳不出十九國特委會的手心。呵呵，昔人所說的［陽九之厄］，恰好應在日本身上，那一個陽］字不是明明指的太陽國麽？小說混江龍的奇遇  火雪明　　茫然的情緒正像茫然的夜色一様，支配了他的全身。他忘了悲哀，忘了憤怒，也忘了自己，並不哭泣，並不戰抖，也並不想報仇：只獨自睜大了眼對看着流血的死孩的首級，不知道自己應該怎様做。　　幾秒鐘過去了。另外在官路上響着皮靴的聲音，幾點掩映於月色裏的昏黄的燈籠的亮光，也漸漸地照引着夜巡警察走近來。混江龍悄然的依舊立着。他沒有一些懼怕，但自己也不知道是什麽緣故。等到他的旁邊漸漸聽見吆喝的噪聲，他坦然地訴�說他的妻子殺死了嬰孩的事情。一種憤怒又炙熱起來，但沒有發作。　　［這様夜深，你在這裏幹嗎？］警官嚴酷地詰問。　　［我是想打一點魚。］他無助地回答，凸出了眼一動都不動。　　［但是這死孩的首級丨你手上衣裳上的血跡？］　　［不知道。總之我·········］他聲音戰抖着，不能再說下去了，咽住了。才覺得森寒刻骨的悲哀，寂寞，憤恨，他全身發冷了，哭泣了，他要報仇，丨向那個因爲不慣貧窮而又姘人失踪了的毒辣的婦人。　　［總之，你這壞蛋，殺了自家養不活的小孩子丨］警官用鐵一般肯定的語氣指着他說：［兄弟們，替我拿起來！带到牢獄去丨不用刑，他怎麽肯供？］不待說完，正伺候著一種機會的黑衣警察們，很威嚴的也很粗暴的，把混江龍反剪着手，加了沉重的脚鐐，鞭打着，歡呼着，在極端的得意中；带他漸漸地離開了大榆樹。　　辯白自己的無罪和哭泣是徒然的，終於脚鐐的聲響，雜在［笑］與［哭］的月光裏就消失了。　　以後我們鎭上，就不曾看見過混江龍。他的姘婦，據說又和一個警察實行同居之愛了。（完）穿土布難  瑛　　丨只認衣衫不認人丨　　當我穿上了土布衣衫的時候，遇着了朋友，他們不會說你愛國，而祗說你：［怎麽，窮了嗎？］我想怪不得有錢佬不穿土布了。　　倘有一　髮而穿着土布衣取，布平鞋和面孔很好看的女子在街上走，三兩個摩登少女在伊的身旁行　的時候，伊們會說：［　個女子若穿起甚麽綢緞的時裝衣服，着起高跟皮鞋，拿起美國新運來的手夾，燙起頭髮，那麽就好看得萬倍了］，我想，伊才　天然的美呢？　　做明星的穿土布也難，若穿起土布，大多數的人們不說伊們愛國，祗說伊沒有錢做衣服，所以假愛國，若穿起綢緞，就說伊們這個時候，還穿得五顏綠色，好像賣美一様，全沒有一點襆素的美。我想明星因爲這様的緣故，就比吃藥還要苦。　　鄉下人穿起土布，沒有人說他是愛國，還憎惡地避開他。　　很多的有錢佬見着一個穿土布的朋友去探望他的時候，他會現出不快樂的神色，因爲這様，會使他失去了不少有錢人的威風。　　所以我想穿土布的難處是說不盡的。各有千秋躺在板門上（下）  丁悚　　那老婦人口裏就喊着死者的乳名道：　　［琪？最愛你Ｓ先生和師母，還有Ｇ師母，Ｋ小姐，都來看你了，他們都是很歡喜你的呀，你怎不開口呀？你應該起來迎接呀］　　老婦人這様一陣的悲鳴，引逗得屋裏許多人的眼淚，都忍不住了。那幾個女的索性出聲哭了，他們那一個年紀輕些的女子，也嚷着道：　　［琪！都是我們害你的呀。你小小的年紀，吃了這様的大苦，還犧牲了你一條性命，呌我如何對得住去世的父親呀？琪丨你死了，我們也活不成了，我們跟你一同去吧！］························　　離這幕悲劇後的一年的一天，Ｓ先生到了一座很有名的古刹裏去隨喜，古刹裏的方丈，原和Ｓ先生是很莫逆的，兩人一相見，就很快活的有說有笑，不拘形跡，那時那個地方丈便說道：［Ｇ先生是你的好朋友呀，你可曉得他現在在這裏剃度了，］Ｓ先生聽了，陡的一驚，忙道：［什麽，Ｃ他會在這裏剃度麽？］方丈微微的一笑道：［是呀！他是來懺悔的，他的剃度原因，一半也是你造成他的呢。。］Ｓ先生聽了，赿發覺得詫異，連問道：［大師你儘是這様隱隱約約的說話，弄得我更加不明白了，可否讓我去見見他，問問他剃度的原因？方丈道：［你别忙！就是你要去見他，他不見你，也是枉然。你眞要知道他的剃度原因，老衲倒可告訴你一二，你就可明白了。］說罷，抽身起來，向右面書架上取出了一本古式裝訂的書籍翻了一會，翻出書　一版，指給Ｓ先生看：····················孽障　　浙西宋生，世家子也。精音律。辨五聲，錦心繡口，海上無不知名。有友某，魯人，名　家也。俱騷壇名士，慧業文人，針芥相投，甚爲莫逆。一日二人方瀹茗話舊，　談上下古今，會有生之女弟子席瑜來謁，生卽爲某紹介相識，是固名塲交際，　甚平常，數日之後，瑜怱來告，某欲伊習畫，生以爲此女氷雪聰明，天眞大方，投此中年名師，當可無礙，况某且子女繞膝矣，卽允其往還。詎意彼等於暢施遊西子湖歸來，此可愛之瑜，已非完璧，豈生始料所及哉？事漸爲女母及女師知之，亦以家醜不可外揚，隱忍之，某故有家室，境又清寒，今復多一負擔，益覺不支。爾時瑜於自身業務，已屢屢缺席，生但意其懶骨復生，不料其已　有塊肉。迨秋風起時，瑜忽走訪生夫婦，謂蒙某顯者之夫人，辟爲記室，將有遠行，特來走辭，且此後行踪靡定，隨時再通尺素可也。生伉儷依依惜别，亦不慮其有他，不意一去半年，僅通二函，最後一簡，辭意隱約委宛，似有無量隱痛者，詎知爲最後之訣别，更豈料彼等走千里，至漢臯，營萬刦之生涯哉？迨　胎得疾，乘輪言歸，已無復人形，生夫婦聞耗往視，則此玲瓏之瑜，已　陳板木，魂歸離恨之天矣。片茵覆面，似藏無限幽怨，而羞見其平日愛護備至之老師師母然。嬴瘦骨立之老母，哀啼已至聲嘶，一燈似豆，搖搖於蕭然四壁中，厥光慘綠如鬼火，生伉儷悽痛欲絶，追踵至某家，欲問其當　人何種地獄，則某亦已逃禪某叢林，作餘生懺悔去矣。</p>

<p>自由談驚人發展  玄　　十一日報載日内瓦電訊，國聯處理中日爭端，將有［驚人發展］云云。哦！國聯要主持［公道］了麽？我們恪遵［長期抵抗］的憲訓的人民　聽下，當眞是感激萬分！　　然而我們細考這將有的驚人發展的來由，却原來是爲了日本要［獨呑］滿洲而國聯則根據李頓報告書的建議部分要［共管］滿洲。在獨呑的局面下，東北非我所有，但在共管的形式下，東北亦未必爲我所實有。至人公的我們在日内瓦［驚人發展］以後依然是被掠奪而已！　　李頓報告書發表以後、我們曾經聽得一些［學者名流］讚揚之爲［公平。］學者名流雖然是中華民國的人民，但他們在讚揚李頓報告書爲［公平］這點上，確已成爲［第三種人。］現在國聯抖擻精神要採用李頓報告書的建議，並且準備［兌取實施的途徑，］這在我們貴國的［第三種人］看來，當然是公平之上文加了公平，眞所謂［國聯有靈，不負苦心人！］　　可昌學才名流也許還不肯自承爲［第三種人，］他們要申明他們的愛國之道。他們會有這様的高論：自家的力量總是不能從强盜手中取回失物的了，何如慷慨一下，這强鄰共管，做一個順水人情，况且我們還落得一個擁有［主權］的虚名？　　這様聰明的邏輯，自然是學者名流拿手的好戲。只可惜李頓報告書的建議部份不但想共管東北，還暗示了共管全中國的［公正］提議，這一點，聰明的學者名流雖然裝作不懂，而愚笨的小百姓却不肯忘記。　　等着罷丨日内瓦在眼前這［驚人發展］以後，還有一次更驚人的發展呢丨那時候，李頓調查圑功德圓滿，全中國都成了共管下的太平世界，那時候，國　當眞结束，而［長期抵抗］的意想不到的效力於是乎顯著丨　　然而最討厭的是不懂禮貎只曉得要飯喫的四萬萬中國老百姓却未必那様好說話！深夜的霞飛路  鄭伯奇　　霞飛路是摩登的，摩登小姐和摩登少爺高興地說。　　霞飛路是神秘的，肉感的，異國趣味的，自命爲摩登派的詩人文士也這様附和着說。　　是的，霞飛路有［佳妃座］，有吃茶店，有酒塲，有電影院，有跳舞塲，有按摩室，有德法俄各式的大菜館，還有］非摩登］人們所萬萬夢想不到的秘戲窟。每到晚間，平直的舖道上，渡看一隊隊的摩登女士：街道樹底，籠罩着脂粉的香氣，强色彩的年紅燈下，跳出了爵士的舞曲。這［不夜城］，這音樂世界，這異國情調，這一切，都是摩登小姐和摩登少爺乃至摩登派的詩人文士所賞讚不置的。因此，霞飛路就成了詩的材料，小說的材料，乃至散文隨筆的材料。據說，爲他們，霞飛路是特别有藝術的　園氣。　　這也很好。横竪這些人都感覺到時間過剩，金錢過剩乃至生命過剩的痛苦。享樂，讓他們享樂去罷。　　不過，當心呀，摩登小姐少爺乃至摩登文士；當你們從逸園倦舞興酣或者從回力球塲豪賭歸來的時候，當心霞飛路頭的悽凉可怕的光景。　　那時候，漫步的情侶早已回到各自的愛巢去了，街上的行人寥寥。酒香肉香早已被夜半的寒風吹散。只有年紅燈光很孤單地在明滅着。電事是早已停了，汽車開足了馬力已從力竭氣嘶的黄包車夫身傍駛過。　　你們也許就是那些汽車中的人。你們也許很［寫意］地觀賞這冷清的夜景。　　不過，假使你們還有餘興的時候，你們也許會在清靜的舗道上挽着手兒步行。那，你們所發見的將是另外一個様子了。　　你們將要發見一羣一羣衣服　　的白俄，三三五五靠着大洋房的灰色的墻壁竚立着，用猙猛可怕的目光向你們張望。他們也許是吃醉了酒正想尋人挑釁以洩海外流浪的鬰憤：他們也許是還餓着肚皮像亂狼一般想擇人而噬；他們也許是今夜還沒有安息的家望着輕裘暖裳的你們發恨。因此，他們的眼光自然是兇惡可怕。而這可怕的眼光一定會使你們感覺到不安。　　或者，你們將要遇見别様的情形。在僻靜的弄堂口的暗淡的電燈下，一個或者兩三個白俄婦人用洋涇浜式的英國話來歡迎你們招待你們。她們會給你們送來一個嬌笑，飛來一個眼波。假使她或她們是俏麗而年靑，你們或將感覺到又麻又癢的味兒，心搖搖而不自持。也許你們便不自持地跟了她們去，而得到一夜的狂歡。假使她或她們是老醜或者粗胖，你們將要打一個寒噤便興味索然地逃去。　　這不安，掃興乃至狂歡，便是深夜的霞飛路所給與你們的賜物。　　不過，你們所得的還不止這些，你們若肯花費一點你們過剩的時間，那些襤褸的粗男子或脂粉妝成的俏婦人一定會對你們訴說自己的痛苦，并且咒駡一番自己所痛恨的［窮黨］。　　是的，［窮黨］，是他們和她們至死也不能忘記的敵人。因爲［窮黨］，他們和她們失却了千百年來享受慣了的驕奢淫佚的生活。千百年來，像　羊一様，像笨牛一様，受慣了侮辱期騙掠奪榨取的老百姓和小工人，竟然在［窮黨］的影響之下，推翻了神聖的［沙爾］的統治，打破了他們和她們的特殊地位。那些］窮黨］，和那些畜生一般的苦工和窮百姓是多麽可恨呀！不然，現在隆冬的時候，他們和她們也可以和你們一様，穿着輕裘，飮着醇酒，聽着音樂，擁抱着，𢌞舞着，正在追尋一夜的狂歡呢！�　　然而，歷史是無情地進展。社會上的優越者，終不免因自己所造成的矛盾而沒落。到頭來，他們和她們只落得流落異鄕空做着復壁之萝。咬斷了牙齒在咒駡窮黨，望穿了醉眼在等待列强反蘇聯戰爭的勝利，然而在和平主義的旗幟之丨，第二次一年計劃又走上成功的道路了。　　他們和她們惟一的出路，只有肉的零賣和酒精的燃燒。說起來，這也是一羣可憐的人們。對於這様沒落的人，你們抱什麽感想呢？　　　摩登的小姐少爺，你們一定會感覺到難過；摩登派的詩人文士，你們也許要表示點同情。同情是高尚的道德，難過是你們必有的感情，當然沒有什麽話可說。不過，歷史是依然無情的進展，這社會老早已經發生了地震。當心你們自己的脚下罷丨蘧廬絮語（三）  子　　　白話詩果爲亡國之音乎　　十年前，張耀翔先生作［新詩人之情緒］長文，載於心理雜誌三卷二號。此文分析新詩人之情緒，係　據嘗試集，革兌，冬夜，女神，　　，春水，浪花，新詩年選，　話詩研究集九部白話詩集所見感歎符號而統計之。結果，九部詩集共千二百六十一首，一萬一千三百三十九行，發見！號二千六百三十個，平均每首兩個，或每四行二個。二千六百三十！號中，以附於［了］者爲最多，有二百九十四，［呵］［啊］者次之，二百五十六。［呀］［喲］［罷］［呢］又次之，合上三者計之，得九百二十三，幾佔全數三分之一。張先生以爲［了　適去之詞，老年人常思過去，少年常思未來；呵，啊爲挑夫出力之聲；呀爲嬰兒學語之聲；喲，　喲，爲病夫呻吟之聲，罷爲放棄之詞；呢，哩，哪，爲各處之土音，不　　於　　聞之。新詩人　　以一人而　爲老者　　兒，　力，　夫，鄕下土人，悲觀厭　者，只不爲一般　全，快樂，交　，　年人。又　［每四句一！號，印在紙上，或司空見慣不以爲怪；　便　一人　　之，每　四句作一歎息，或呌喊一聲，　者未有不　耳却走，　讀者爲　狂者也。］此文中　　Ｓｈａｈｅｇｐｏｏｔ　Ｍｉｌｔｏｇ，Ｂｃｔｉｔｉｂｄｏｉ　Ｄ　ｎｉｔ　　人詩　，及Ｇｏｆｄｅｎ　ｉｔａｐｏｃｙ　詩　而分析之。所得　　如此：　　［中國現在流行之白話詩，平均每四行有　　號，或每千行有二百三十二嘆號。公　之外國好詩平均每二十五行始有一嘆號，或每千行有二十九　號，中國白話詩比外國好詩　號多六倍。中國新詩人比外國大詩　六倍易於動感嘆。予　　　　序云：［、治　之音　以樂全　其政和：亂世之　怨以怒，其政　；亡國之音　以思，其民困。］若今之白話詩。可謂亡國之音矣。］　　鳴呼！今之白話詩果爲亡國之音乎？　　　索音樂家哲學家女學家社會學家而問之？黑女求神記  蕭伯訥作宣閑譯　　［神在什麽地方呢］？黑女孩子對使她信敎的敎士說。　　［他說着：尋看，你可以見到我，］那敎士說。　　那敎士是個小巧的白女子，還不到二十歲：一個怪小的體；她是在本　英格蘭她那體面而小　的家庭找不到心靈上的滿意，這繞在亞非利加森林裏住　下，敎亞非利加的小孩子們愛基督，敬十字架。她是天生的愛的傳道者。在求學時代，她曾經以偶像崇拜的心情丨丨這是足以防護一切呵責的　崇拜着她的有個把敎師，然而對於年紀和地位同她相仿的女孩子們，却沒有加以多大的關心。到十八歲，他開始同懇羣的牧師們發生戀愛，於是實際上先後約婚於他們中間六個人。然而戀愛每到那一點，她總就將牠破裂了；因爲這些戀愛的事　，起初充滿着極樂的幸福和希望，逐漸有些非現實的光景，到頭便避開她了。這様子突然地，莫明其妙地被退婚的牧師們常常沒有瞞住他們的寛慰和解脫的感覺，彷彿他們也早就發見到夢只是夢，只是一種　喻，這　喻，他們努力用以表現實的事，可是本身並非現實的事。話雖如此，然而被丢棄者之一却自殺了；這悲劇給了她異常的喜悦。這似乎將他從假幸福的愚人的天堂带到現實的境域裏，在這境域，深烈的受苦是成了無比的狂喜的。然而這一回事却將她那怪特的迭次約婚的舉動阻止了。這並不是說這是最後一次的約婚。只是，一個俗世的表姊，具着她有些懼憚的機智，委婉地呌過她騷姐兒和薄倖女，那表姊一天指責她：在她後來的幾塲約婚，又玩弄着自殺案了；並且告訴她：有許多女人，案子不到這許多，可就已經被絞殺了。雖然她以一種的想法，知道遠是不確的，那表姊是這俗世的女人，沒有了解啦；可是她也知道：照世俗，這是十分確實的，而勾引男子們來人她現在自知守不住的約婚的圈套這一種希奇的游戲，她總得放棄了繞行。因此，她丢棄了第六個牧師，便去種植十字架於最黑暗的亞非利加；她所棄絶的作爲罪惡的事在她内中的末次的擾動便是憤怒的一閃，當他同那表姊結婚的時候。就仗着那表姊的俗世的知慧和機智，不管他自己怎様，總之他做到主敎了。那黑女孩子，是優秀的傢伙，她那緞様的皮膚和發亮的筋肉是使敎會襄的白人們相形之下似乎好像灰色的羣鬼的，她是感着興味，然而沒有滿意的信敎者；這是怎麽說呢？原來她沒有以甜美的柔順性來收納基督敎，恰如灘輸給她的那原様，偏以意料不到的疑問的反應來迎合牠，這種反應　得她的敎師臨時來製作敎義上的答案，乘一時之興，那麽地來發明　據　竟至她終於瞞不住自己這様的事實，她所叙述的基督的生涯已經　附了這麽許多環境的詳情和這麽一堆杜造的敎義，假如諸福音士活到如今，聽得這都託稱爲他們所作，他們就不免要　異　愕了罷。的確，那敎士之選擇特别遠遠的塲所，起初原是　誠的得爲，不多久可就成爲必要的事了，爲什麽呢？因爲競敵的敎士的出現是會引起這一種發見來的就是：雖然她所調製的福音布丁襄的精華，有些最優美的是從聖書上拾來，背景和人物也是從聖書上楷來的，可是，那合志的宗敎，雖有這一種編　的成分，究竟是敎士自己直接的感　的產物。只有做一個孤獨的先鋒敎士，她　能夠成立她自己的敎會，决定牠的敎規，而不至於有機當作異敎徒而破門的恐懼。</p>

<p>The Draft Report Was Passed in Its Entirety by the Committee of Nineteen</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, upon instruction from the Committee of Nineteen, warned Japanese Chief Delegate Yosuke Matsuoka today that any Japanese military action in Jehol would make mediation efforts, which were already fragile, difficult and urged the Japanese government to take it seriously. (Central News Agency dispatch from 3:30 AM, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is learned that before the drafting committee passed the report and recommendations on Saturday, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden expressed that he would seek instructions from his government. Eden has now received instructions from the British government, ordering him not to raise any reservations within the Committee of Nineteen this afternoon. Currently, representatives of various countries have openly and frankly discussed the procedures to be taken after Japan's rejection of the proposed plan. All agree that the first step at that time should be to consult with the United States and Russia to ascertain the extent of Britain's willingness to cooperate in pressuring Tokyo to accept the proposals. This consultation will be carried out in accordance with the provision in the last section of the proposal inviting non-member groups to coordinate actions. However, it must be delayed until after the new US President Roosevelt takes office. Leaders of the League of Nations expect that pressure on Tokyo can be based on Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty, Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, or Articles 10 and 11 of the League of Nations Covenant. However, it is considered better to base it on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris to avoid the need to ask the United States to assist in implementing the Covenant. It is also noteworthy that although the League of Nations has tried to avoid mentioning Article 16 of the Covenant, it acknowledges that all sanction actions stipulated in Article 16 do not need to be proposed, and that the article can almost be fully implemented. Those familiar with the inside story generally expect that even if Japan initially rejects the League of Nations' proposals, pressure will eventually force Japan to gradually accept the proposals and agree to negotiations. Therefore, everyone feels that the negotiation committee, which the drafting committee agreed on after many twists and turns, will be realized after Japan is subjected to some economic pressure. (National News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's reply was delivered to Secretary-General Drummond this morning. As expected, the reply did not provide a concrete answer to the League of Nations' inquiry. It only reiterated its previous statements, saying that it did not object to including the principles contained in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report in the draft proposal, but with the understanding that the actual development of current events must be taken into account when applying these principles. The reply also mentioned Japan's moderate position, stating that the Japanese government firmly believes that maintaining the independence of [Manchukuo] is the only guarantee for peace in the Far East, and the entire issue must be resolved by China and Japan on this basis. (Reuters dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the Committee of Nineteen meets at 3:30 PM today, it will discuss Japan's reply to the Committee's inquiry regarding the recognition of [Manchukuo] and will decide what kind of full response to give. Several members expressed regret regarding the Jehol situation. It is generally believed that such feelings will be reflected in the reply to Japan, and it is expected that the wording of the reply to Japan will be more severe than that used by Secretary-General Drummond in his talks with Matsuoka. (Reuters dispatch from the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen today announced the completion of the report on the Manchurian case. It is widely believed that Japan and the League of Nations will break apart as a result of this report. It is reported that Japanese Chief Delegate Matsuoka has informed League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond that Japan does not intend to halt military actions in Jehol, and that the [Manchukuo] government is prepared to cooperate with the Japanese army to clear out all Chinese troops in Jehol Province. (National News Agency dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's reply to the Committee of Nineteen regarding China's sovereignty in Manchuria arrived in Geneva today and is expected to be delivered to Secretary-General Drummond approximately tomorrow. It is reported that the reply reiterates Japan's position and does not provide a concrete answer to the questions raised by the Committee. Therefore, the Committee may complete its discussion of the report tomorrow afternoon and pass the proposed plan, and convene the League of Nations General Assembly to meet on Monday. At that time, the General Assembly will definitely pass this report and the proposed plan. Although some parties suggest that the door to mediation remains open until the General Assembly reaches a resolution, it is generally felt that regarding the Committee's current attitude, the door to mediation is now closed because Japan's reply has not provided a concrete answer to the Committee's inquiries. According to the views of many members of the Committee, if Japan accepts the original proposal of the December 15 resolution, deletes the section inviting non-member states to join, and attaches the reservations under Section 5 of the explanatory memorandum, the League of Nations would be in an awkward predicament. Now that Japan has rejected this resolution, it is generally expected that Japan will not accept this proposed plan. However, opinions vary on how things will develop in the future. According to those responsible for studying the League of Nations Covenant, if Japanese troops are still within Chinese territory three months after the passage of this report, it is naturally an act of violating the Covenant, and China can request the implementation of sanctions under Article 16 of the Covenant. In any case, the meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly next Monday is bound to have surprising developments. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Summary of the Proposed Plan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Covenants and Conventions Must Be Observed</p>
<p>Negotiations Should First Urge Japan to Withdraw Troops</p>
<p>Invite the US and Russia to Join Cooperation</p>
<p>Non-Recognition of the Puppet Manchukuo Organization</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the third section of the draft report of the nine-person subcommittee, the concluding remarks, was published, the fourth section, the proposed plan, was also distributed to the members of the Committee of Nineteen in its final form today. General opinion believes that there may not be any changes to this proposed plan when the Committee of Nineteen meets tomorrow. The full text of the proposed plan has not yet been released, but the summary of its full text is as follows. The original text is divided into three major sections, each section divided into several subsections:</p>
<p>Section 1</p>
<p>A. The resolution must be in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant, the Pact of Paris, and the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>B. The resolution must be consistent with Sections 1 and 2 of the resolution of March 11.</p>
<p>C. The resolution must also be consistent with the principles declared by Briand on December 10, 1931.</p>
<p>D. Member states of the League of Nations must not recognize situations created in violation of the League of Nations Covenant and the Pact of Paris.</p>
<p>E. The resolution must not be sought under military pressure.</p>
<p>F. This section states the principles of the Lytton Report, Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant (Member States undertake to respect and preserve the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League against external aggression), the Pact of Paris, and the Nine-Power Treaty, and declares that the resolution must be consistent with these.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Section 2, Section 1 of the Proposal <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>A. The establishment of a new civil administration in Manchuria. This organization should be autonomous in nature but under Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>B. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from all areas outside the railway zone.</p>
<p>C. The resolution of other outstanding issues between China and Japan.</p>
<p>D. Negotiations between the two parties to meet the above proposals.</p>
<p>Section 2, Section 2</p>
<p>Negotiations must take place under the supervision of a committee designated by the League of Nations General Assembly. This committee will invite the United States and Russia to participate.</p>
<p>Section 2, Section 3</p>
<p>This committee must prepare a report on the establishment of the new civil administration and the progress of troop withdrawal. This report must be submitted to the member states of the League of Nations, the United States, and Russia.</p>
<p>Section 2, Section 4</p>
<p>This committee must submit various issues regarding the interpretation of its powers to the League of Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>Section 3</p>
<p>Member states of the League of Nations must continue not to recognize the existing political situation in Manchuria legally or de facto, and agree not to take any unilateral action regarding the situation in Manchuria. They also agree to continue to act consistently with each other and, to the extent possible, jointly with relevant non-member states.</p>
<p>The following quotes the original text of Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty to remind the signatory countries, stating: The Contracting Powers agree that, whenever there shall arise any situation which, in the opinion of any one of them, involves the application of the stipulations of the present Treaty and renders desirable discussion of such application, there shall be full and frank communication between the Contracting Powers concerned. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Contents of Japan's Reply <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) At 10:00 AM today, Yosuke Matsuoka, in the name of the Japanese delegation, delivered the following formal reply to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond: "I acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 9, which mentioned the resolution adopted by the Committee of Nineteen and the draft declaration of the chairman. I am writing to reply to this. The points you mentioned are among the facts that Japan has repeatedly declared clearly. I myself have also explained in detail to the chairman of the Committee of Nineteen, or to the Administrative Council, or to the General Assembly, and in writing. The Japanese government cannot accept it if the independence of [Manchukuo] becomes a topic of discussion. However, the Manchurian situation is truly factual and of an immutable nature, and it will surely be understood by the world within a sufficient period of time. You said that the members of the Committee of Nineteen are fully aware of the content of our discussions and should not misunderstand Japan's attitude. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Committee of Nineteen agreed to cancel the resolution draft and the chairman's declaration draft regarding inviting non-League of Nations member states to participate in mediation, conditional on the Japanese government acknowledging other matters. The chairman of the Committee of Nineteen and you proposed to me on January 18 that the Japanese government could issue a declaration or submit a reservation to explain Japan's attitude towards the last section of the chairman's declaration draft. At that time, it was generally believed that the Committee of Nineteen would not raise any objections to Japan's above-mentioned measures. I firmly believe that the above-mentioned proposal would not have been made if the Committee of Nineteen did not have some understanding of the situation. The Japanese delegation's view has been confirmed by the public announcement on February 4. The Japanese government has no objection to including the principles in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report in the resolution and chairman's declaration. However, the principles in Chapter 9 should take into account the current development of events and the principles that a true mediation should have, because a true mediation must be based on impartiality and not prejudge the future situation. The Japanese government has adopted this conciliatory attitude, believing that the Committee of Nineteen has already understood Japan's attitude on this issue, that is, continuing to recognize the independence of [Manchukuo] is the only guarantee for peace in the Far East, and all issues between China and Japan should be resolved on this basis. The Japanese government believes that this point should be calmly discussed by the Mediation Committee, just like discussing other points, and also firmly believes that the Mediation Committee will eventually trust Japan's spirit of justice and its moral strength. I hope this reply will allow you to fully understand Japan's point of view, and the Japanese delegation deeply appreciates the various efforts completed by the Committee of Nineteen and you in this incident."

<p>The League of Nations Upholds Justice, Which Is a Proper Action</p>
<p>Our Government Temporarily Remains Silent on the Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, the Committee of Nineteen made five or six textual amendments to the first three chapters of the report before passing it on the 13th, due to the proposal of the Irish representative, all of which were more favorable to us. It continued to meet on the 14th to discuss the fourth chapter, the proposed section, and there will be no changes in principle, but there may be slight textual revisions. If the meeting on the 14th cannot be completed, it will continue to meet on the 15th. Therefore, the General Assembly session will be extended to next Monday (the 20th). Currently, the Japanese side has decided to oppose the report, but the League of Nations' attitude is also extremely strong, so Japan and the League of Nations may have a head-on collision. Our government has now decided to remain silent for the time being, because it is still unknown whether the League of Nations General Assembly will pass smoothly, and even if it passes smoothly, it is only a proper action by the League of Nations to uphold justice and fairness. Although we have achieved a moral victory, it would be too much to expect that the lost territory of the three northeastern provinces can be recovered by this. Therefore, the self-defense policy cannot be relaxed in the slightest. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen passed the entire draft report tonight and submitted it to the League of Nations General Assembly next Tuesday (the 21st) for final approval. The shortcoming of the report is that it does not set a deadline for the two parties to accept it, and Japan may use this point to deliberately ignore it.

<p>No Expression for the Time Being</p>
<p>(Washington) Under Secretary of State Castle replied to reporters' inquiries today, saying that the United States has not guaranteed to participate in the League of Nations' efforts to mediate the Manchurian case. Currently, the State Department has not received any formal news on whether the United States will be invited to join the negotiation committee, and the League of Nations has not yet inquired about the US government's opinion. In the future, if invited, whether the United States will participate will also depend on the nature of the task and the responsibilities it bears. Regarding the news of the report of the Committee of Nineteen, Castle and other State Department personnel declined to comment, strictly adhering to Stimson's declaration last year, not to make any policy statements before the League of Nations General Assembly makes a decision.

<p>(Washington) The resolutions and proposals of the Nine-Person Subcommittee have now been published, and Japan has not sent a clear reply to the League of Nations, only reiterating its position on [Manchukuo]. Therefore, Washington political circles all regard Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations as a predetermined conclusion. There is now genuine fear here that a large-scale war in Manchuria will be inevitable. Many people expect that Japan's second step will be to blockade various Chinese ports.

<p>Blue and Black Armies to Practice Offensive and Defensive Warfare</p>
<p>No Live Ammunition, But Striving for Realism</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail today published an article by its naval correspondent on the upcoming exercises of the US Atlantic and Pacific naval fleets, stating that the scale of this exercise is unprecedented, with a total of 164 battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and aircraft carriers. It will test whether the defenses of the US West Coast are reliable. The overall plan for the exercise is for the reconnaissance fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Clark, to lead the [Black] attacking force, with the heavy cruiser Augusta as the flagship, and two other heavy cruiser squadrons, one aircraft carrier, and one destroyer flotilla. Battleship Fleet Commander Admiral McNair will command the [Blue] army and defend the Pacific coast, leading three battleship squadrons, three light cruiser squadrons, four destroyer flotillas, six submarine squadrons, one aircraft carrier, and several supply ships. US Fleet Commander Admiral Leigh will serve as the chief judge. When the two armies are fighting, they intend to strive for realism. When a ship or a squadron encounters the enemy, all actions in the ship will be as if they are in a real battle. However, for economic reasons, no live ammunition will be used. After the exercise, each squadron will gather in the San Pedro and San Diego areas to hear comments on each battle scene. There will also be a fleet gathering on that sea surface to practice tactics, gunnery, and torpedo launching. From February 18 to March 31, everything will be commanded by Admiral Leigh.

<h3 id="e12">British and French Attitudes Toward Japan Suddenly Become Stronger <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Britain Is Constrained by the US Due to War Debts</p>
<p>France Follows Britain to Win Over Opposition Parties</p>
<p>(Geneva) The biggest reason for the recent hardening of British and French attitudes towards Japan is the Jehol issue. Britain's attitude is due to (1) China's threat to boycott British goods, (2) concerns about the US due to the war debt issue, (3) considerations of domestic and colonial liberal public opinion, and criticism of Foreign Minister Simon, who has always been too pro-Japanese. Also, due to the urgency of the Jehol issue, the British commercial bases of Peiping and Tientsin are in danger of being invaded, so Britain's attitude has recently had to turn to active guidance of the League to pressure Japan. As for France, because it has fewer interests in the Far East, its foreign policy in the Far East has always been based on following Britain. Recently, its attitude has also changed with Britain, and the current cabinet needs to win over the Socialist Party in order to stabilize its position, which is also a domestic reason for the change in France's pro-Japanese attitude.

<p>Seeking Understanding from Elder Statesmen and Senior Officials</p>
<p>Voting Against the Proposed Plan</p>
<p>Issuing a Statement Based on Item 5</p>
<p>Ultimately Resulting in Withdrawal</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry believes that the Committee of Nineteen's application of Item 4 of Article 15 is a contempt for Japan's position and disrupts peace in the Far East. The League of Nations' lack of understanding of the Far East issue has now been fully exposed. As a result of the consultation among the heads of the Foreign Ministry at the Foreign Minister's residence yesterday afternoon, it was decided to resolutely resist the League of Nations' inappropriateness and insincerity through the following process: (1) When the report attached to the proposal is submitted to the General Assembly, Representative Matsuoka will be instructed to make an opposing speech. (2) When the General Assembly makes its final vote, it will not adopt a lenient attitude of abstaining, but will resolutely vote against it to break the General Assembly's decision to reach a consensus. (3) In opposition to the recommendation, a final statement will be submitted based on Item 5 of Article 15, strongly asserting Japan's position and pointing out the League of Nations' lack of understanding to the point where it is completely discredited. (4) When the proposed plan is established and adopted at the General Assembly, Representative Matsuoka will be instructed to issue a declaration stating that the Japanese government will no longer participate in discussions of the General Assembly or even the Board of Directors regarding the Manchurian issue, and then withdraw the Japanese delegation. When the delegation returns home, it will simultaneously independently decide to withdraw from the League of Nations. (Den-tsu dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">A Word for the Soviet Union Inspection Group <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, we wrote a commentary advocating the organization of a Soviet Union inspection group to conduct a positive inspection of everything in the Soviet Union. Yesterday, it was reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to understand the commercial situation between China and the Soviet Union and to investigate the domestic industrial and commercial development after the success of the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan, intends to organize a Soviet Union industrial and commercial inspection group to conduct practical inspections of industry and commerce in the Soviet Union for reference. At the same time, most leaders of the domestic industrial circles also believe that China's industry is still in its infancy and needs to draw strength from friendly countries, so they have initiated the organization of a Soviet Union inspection group to go for inspection, and they hope that after arriving in the Soviet Union, they can exchange knowledge about the economic situation of the two countries with economic figures there. We should certainly express our support for these two organizations. We believe that this is the first time that our leaders have decisively stood on the positive side of the Soviet Union and made a close and transparent view of the true face of the Soviet Union. It is also the first sound of mutual understanding between the Chinese and Soviet nations since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union. Its significance is more than just [understanding the commercial situation between China and the Soviet Union and investigating the industrial and commercial development of the Soviet Union].</p>
<p>However, before the inspection group is still in the process of being organized, we would also like to offer our humble opinion.</p>
<p>First, we believe that the purpose of organizing the inspection group should not only be to travel, nor should it only be to [understand the commercial situation between China and the Soviet Union and investigate the industrial and commercial development of the Soviet Union]. The advanced industrial countries in Europe and America have already given us clear indications and provided us with very clear models regarding general technical issues of industry and commerce, such as factory management, technical training, vigorous implementation of production rationalization, and competing for markets to accumulate profits. Today, there is no need to travel long distances to seek them from this emerging country.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that the world's observation of the Soviet Union often harbors subjective prejudices. Only [prejudice] leads to misunderstanding, and only subjectivity often deliberately obscures the facts. All subjective praise and blame only give people incorrect understandings, making the truth of the Soviet Union fall further into a fog. At the same time, only by having subjective prejudices can the observer himself fundamentally gain nothing from the Soviet Union. Wielding praise and blame has fundamentally nothing to do with the Soviet Union. Therefore, before going to the Soviet Union, this inspection group must first remove its colored glasses and subjective views and conduct the most meticulous inspection with a purely objective attitude in order to recognize the truth of the Soviet Union and harvest correct knowledge.</p>
<p>Third, we believe that what this inspection group should focus on most when going to the Soviet Union is that in the Soviet Union, there are neither unemployed workers nor vagrants without support. All Soviet citizens, whether they are workers, farmers, women, or children, can do their best to exert their creativity to build a new Soviet state and consolidate its foundation. Moreover, everyone is full of vitality. Conversely, on the other hand, all European and American countries are suffering from the increasingly rising tide of unemployment. The cries for bread and work shake the mountains, and financiers and entrepreneurs can only burn their heads with anxiety and are unable to cope. This contrast, which stands in exactly the opposite position, shows that the Soviet Union stands outside this desolate world. However, the Soviet Union still exists in this same world. The whole world is desolate, but the Soviet Union is prosperous. What is the reason? We deeply hope that the inspection group can conduct a thorough inspection and answer this great mystery of the universe for us.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Soviet Union is the most meaningful and beneficial action for our country. Now, the industrial and commercial circles have begun to organize inspection groups. We deeply hope that all circles will continue to follow suit.</p>

<p>Nine Hundred People Killed by Aerial Bombardment</p>
<p>Material Losses Beyond Calculation</p>
<p>(Geneva) The chairman of the Rehe Provincial Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of the Education Association jointly telegraphed the League of Nations. The telegram was forwarded by the Chinese delegation and has been delivered to the Secretariat. The text of the telegram is as follows: [Since January, our defenseless region has been subjected to inhumane aerial bombardment by the Japanese army, especially in Kailu and Chaoyang. To date, nine hundred men, women, and children have been killed by Japanese air raids, and material losses are beyond calculation. The purpose of these atrocities committed in Manchuria and Rehe is to coerce us into joining the puppet state of Manchukuo, which we absolutely cannot accept. We, on behalf of the five million Chinese people of Rehe Province, appeal to the League of Nations to stop this purely destructive action.] End of telegram. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Chinese delegation in Geneva distributed a lengthy document to the representatives of various countries at the League of Nations, listing seven instances of Japanese military activity around Yu Guan, stating that four of them occurred in various locations in Rehe in recent days.

<p>(London) The Times editorial today criticized the recent developments in the Manchurian issue, stating that the League of Nations, in advocating a resolution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, is unwilling to adopt ambiguous plans merely to obtain Japan's unconscious acceptance to shirk responsibility. The solution proposed by the League of Nations is a model method. The environment cannot immediately realize it, but the solution that a fair investigation team believes to be the best and fairest can always be accepted by the parties involved. The Manchester Guardian stated that if Japan does not change its policy, the League of Nations, together with the United States and Russia, will consider future measures to assist the invaded countries. It also stated that China itself may be forced to wage a war of self-defense. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>Sending Documents to the League of Nations Violating Public Opinion</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Mr. Bronson Lee, an American advisor to the [Manchukuo] government, distributed a lengthy document to the members of the Committee of Nineteen, aiming to prove that non-Chinese residents account for 97% of the [Manchukuo] population, and Manchus actually account for 75%. The document concluded that the people of Manchuria gladly seized the opportunity of the September 18th Incident to break away from oppression and restore their independence. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) [Manchukuo] instructed its observer in Geneva to submit a memorandum to the League of Nations, defending [Manchukuo]'s independent sovereignty, stating that 75% of the residents of Manchuria are Manchus, the Chinese government has never conducted a scientific census, and there are no real statistics. It also stated that among the residents of Manchuria, there are 21 million natives, all of whom are natural heirs to the land. Various treaties concluded by the former Beijing government and the current Nanjing government with foreign countries cannot affect the H-Manchuria Treaty. The dispute that the League of Nations has not yet resolved is not related to [Manchukuo]. The country is fully responsible for its own actions and is not under the protection of Japan.

<p>Roosevelt Advocates Joint Discussion of World Economic Issues</p>
<p>MacDonald Declares Agreement in the House of Commons Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e76">Reasons for Understanding Between the British Government and the United States <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: The House of Commons today discussed the future of Anglo-American war debt negotiations. Prime Minister MacDonald declared that when Britain and the United States negotiate the war debt issue, world economic issues should be discussed jointly to seek to revitalize international trade. The British government strongly supports this proposal. The solution of the war debt issue is indeed a prerequisite for revitalizing international trade, but the British government believes that in addition to the war debt issue, there are other economic and financial issues that also need to be discussed. Naylor, the leader of the Liberal Party, and Keynes, the leader of the Labor Party, asked the government to announce to the House of Commons the content of the proposals that the government will put forward when negotiating with the United States. The Prime Minister replied that the issue of the delegation has not yet been decided, and it is best for the House of Commons to wait for the report submitted by the delegation after the negotiations are over, and then decide on the final attitude. As for the main mission of the delegation, it is to make private contact with the US government. The Prime Minister referred to the war debt issue, saying, "We need to establish an understanding with the United States so that Britain's European policy can proceed unhindered." Several members asked the government not to make any decisions with the United States without giving Congress an opportunity to discuss it, but MacDonald did not respond to this.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 13th: This afternoon, the Cabinet held its final meeting in the House of Commons to discuss the war debt issue, so that British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay will go to the United States tomorrow. Before the Cabinet meeting, the Cabinet Committee discussed the war debt issue this morning for an hour and a half. Lindsay also attended. It is said that this trip is not related to war debt negotiations, but only a part of improving the organization of the embassy to meet the needs of the times. Therefore, Bray's trip to the United States should not be regarded as one of the British delegations discussing war debts. Because the British government recently decided to add a financial advisor to each British embassy, Bray went to the United States to take up the position of financial advisor at the embassy.</p>

<p>Advocates the Restoration of the International Gold Standard, War Debts Are Just Part of the Problem</p>
<p>Nationalist, New York, 13th: US President Hoover gave a farewell speech here tonight at the annual Lincoln Day banquet of the National Republican General Assembly before leaving office. Most of it commented on the economic situation, believing that after half of the world's countries have abandoned the gold standard, it has caused</p>
<h3 id="e80">International Financial Chaos <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Is the root cause of the world's economic decline. Therefore, the way to save it must be international cooperation to restore a stable monetary base. If countries are unwilling to join this movement, they will be forced to adopt a self-defense policy of closing themselves off, making the world's economic war more and more intense, and it will not stop until both sides are defeated and completely destroyed. The drawbacks of unstable currency prices, the initial financial panic in a country, and then foreign countries withdrawing their loans, leading to the outflow of funds and currency devaluation, while other countries accumulate idle funds in their treasuries, and the flow of world gold is hindered. Therefore, the solution lies in restoring confidence, but the world's confidence cannot be restored after abandoning the gold standard. This move is not only beneficial to the United States, but is actually needed by the whole world. Only when major countries can</p>
<p>Restore the Gold Standard Early, The Abnormal Trade Barriers and the Crisis of Economic War Can Be Avoided. If the World's Currency Can Be Made Relatively Stable for a Certain Period of Time, Its Gains Will Be a Hundred Times Greater Than Its Losses. The United States has found a three-way intersection in the economic field. First, countries cooperate to remove barriers to world trade and obstacles to raising prices. This is the way to immediately rescue agriculture and reduce unemployment in the world. The second way is that the United States will rely on its vast land and resources to be self-sufficient and increase tariffs, but the future is vast and there is indeed a most distant path that must be adopted only after the first path is blocked. The third path is to expand currency and abandon the gold standard, entering the world's economic war, but the result will inevitably be a complete destruction that will defeat both sides. As for international cooperation, I hope that Americans will not easily believe foreign propaganda, thinking that canceling war debts can obtain international relief. War debts are only part of this problem. Countries are not unable to repay debts, and what they spend on armaments is still more than the war debts that should be repaid. Afterwards, when discussing diplomatic issues, the whole country should be united and not just know the party. Finally, he guaranteed that the Republican Party would support Roosevelt's new government if it was a plan to promote public welfare, otherwise it would oppose it if it was harmful to the public.</p>
<h3 id="e81">French Budget Passed After Lengthy Debate in the House of Commons <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Now Transferred to the Senate for Discussion</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 14th: After 37 hours and 15 minutes of deliberation, the House of Commons today passed the financial bill by a vote of 359 to 225. The length of this deliberation has broken records, and the reason why the government was able to obtain a majority was that the Socialists and Radicals agreed to support the government to resist all opposition to the surtax on income tax and certain luxury taxes. However, with the exception of a reduction of 500 million francs in army spending, which was passed by a vote of 365 to 226, all other reductions were sought to be avoided. Prime Minister Daladier declared to the assembly after the army spending reduction was passed that no amount would be reduced for the necessary affairs of the new army. The dismissal of 5,000 officers, 5,000 horses, and a number of generals who have served for more than five years does not endanger the safety of this affair in the slightest. The financial bill has now been transferred to the Senate, which is scheduled to meet on February 17 to discuss it.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 13th: The House of Commons passed the government's financial draft in its entirety by a vote of 350 to 235. Prior to this, the government had proposed a vote of confidence. The general reporter of the budget case explained that after the House of Commons passed the draft, the government's new sources of revenue were as follows: 1. 90,000,000 francs under the supervision tax item, 2. 1,322,000,000 francs under the tax revenue item, 3. 1,025,000,000 francs under other sources of revenue, and 4. 2,023,000,000 francs saved from various expenses, totaling 5,262,000,000 francs. If combined with the financial plan proposed by the Herriot cabinet in July last year, which was passed by the House of Commons, the government has raised a total of 10 billion francs as a result of its efforts over the past eight months.</p>

<p>Conflicts, Bloodshed, Closure of Newspapers</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 13th: Serious conflicts occurred between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party in various parts of Germany on the weekend. In Eschelsen, Prussia, a small team of Communists opened fire on a National Socialist parade, causing a conflict, killing two people and injuring twenty-seven, including six who are on the verge of death. The town was panicked by this riot, and its police chief has been dismissed. In Staitesfel and four other places, four National Socialists were killed during a Communist demonstration. In Stuttgart, a street fight occurred, seriously injuring seven people. The provincial governments and the federal government are still trying their best to curb the behavior of chaos. The Hitler government has prohibited Thuringia from hanging the red flag. Kiel University had a dispute with the president of the university because National Socialist students used the auditorium to hold political meetings, which caused a disturbance. The authorities have now ordered a three-day suspension of classes. The Central Party issued an election campaign document, which allegedly contains derogatory remarks against Hitler. Therefore, the National Socialist government of Oldenburg has closed down a Catholic newspaper run by Frissoso. The Prussian government has also closed down a Republican newspaper for the same reason. The Berlin Police Commissioner and several police chiefs are all listed on the leave approval list, apparently because they are not members of the National Socialist Party, and they will soon be replaced by capable members of the National Socialist Party. Rumors from the outside say that Prince August Wilhelm, the fourth son of the former emperor, will serve as the temporary governor of Hanover to replace the outgoing Socialist Noske, which has been officially denied by the authorities today. The person to succeed has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 14th – The Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference held its first meeting today, deciding to use the procedure proposed by British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden on January 27th as the basis for discussing various security issues, in order to simultaneously promote the political and technical aspects of the disarmament issue. The first item on the agenda will be to pass a declaration stating that no international disputes should resort to force. The second item is to establish a convention for mutual assistance among nations in the event of an attack.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 14th – Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov proposed at the first meeting of the Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference today to expand the signatory states of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, agree to a declaration not to use force to resolve existing and future disputes, and add an interpretation of "aggressor" to expand the Kellogg-Briand Pact and increase its effectiveness.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 13th – The cracks in the Disarmament Conference are becoming increasingly apparent. When the General Committee held a meeting today to discuss the American disarmament proposal, representatives from Germany and Italy suggested that the abolition of offensive weapons should be included in the agenda first. The French representative, Peng Gu, immediately stood up to object, stating that the disposal of offensive weapons could only be hoped for after the issues of the organization and strength of various armies were resolved, and that the issues of army organization and strength depended entirely on whether the principles of disarmament and security in the French proposal could be satisfactorily addressed. Therefore, it is said that the Disarmament Conference has no way to proceed.</p>

<p>Shells Weigh 670 Pounds</p>
<p>(Reuters Berlin Correspondence) Germany's newly built first ten-thousand-ton "pocket battleship," the Deutschland, is about to raise its flag and join the fleet. The second "pocket ship" will also be launched this spring. Construction of the third has only just begun and will likely not be completed until 1934 at the earliest. The fourth "pocket battleship" will also begin construction next year. These four ships are permitted by the Treaty of Versailles, which stipulates that when Germany discards old ships over 20 years old, newly built ships cannot exceed 10,000 tons. Therefore, Germany's newly built "pocket ships" all use 10,000 tons as the standard. All the machinery of the "pocket ships" is exceptionally light and compact. The ships are equipped with eleven-inch caliber cannons, with shells weighing 670 pounds and a range of 30,000 yards. The construction cost of each ship is said to be four million British pounds.</p>

<p>Yuyu Incident: Britain Decides to Maintain the Boxer Protocol</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th – During the House of Commons meeting today, members asked many questions about the Chinese situation. Conservative Party member Davison asked which parts of the country the central government could effectively govern. Foreign Secretary Simon responded that this question was difficult to answer. Generally speaking, the central government can exercise more direct and therefore more effective governance over the provinces closer to the capital than over the distant provinces. All provinces except Manchuria currently recognize the authority of the central government, except for a few areas occupied by the Communist Party. The Chinese authorities are currently making every effort to maintain law and order and protect the lives and property of foreigners. Conservative Party member Winterton then asked whether the central government had any jurisdiction over the areas where the Communist Party was active, or none at all. Simon replied that he believed the central government's power in these areas was weaker than elsewhere. Winterton then asked whether this constituted a large part of China. Simon replied that he did not want to comment on this and told Winterton to consult a map to see how large China was. Simon also answered another member's question, saying that the British government's policy, in addition to maintaining peace, was mainly to maintain the Boxer Protocol. Labour Party member Kirk asked whether the Foreign Secretary had asked the Chinese and Japanese governments for an explanation or clarification regarding the Sino-Japanese war within the Chinese border at the beginning of this year. If the Foreign Secretary received any communication from the Chinese government regarding this matter, would he report it to the House? Would the Foreign Secretary make a statement regarding the British government's policy? The Foreign Secretary replied in the negative, but said that he had received an explanation regarding the Yuyu Incident. He also stated that on January 11th, the Chinese government sent a note to the signatory countries of the Boxer Protocol, stating that the Japanese army's forced occupation of Yuyu was an illegal use of special rights under the treaty, and that the Chinese government, under these circumstances, could not bear responsibility for any situation caused by the Chinese army's exercise of legitimate self-defense. Simon also answered another member's question, briefly describing the Yuyu Incident, and said that the current situation was reportedly quiet, and that part of the Japanese army had reportedly withdrawn.</p>

<p>Son of Brigade Commander is a Communist Leader</p>
<p>Communist Revolution Perhaps Inevitable</p>
<p>(Hwa-lien, Tokyo) At the end of last December, the Japanese government announced that the Communist Party had been fundamentally destroyed, but within ten days, it was discovered that the heir to Viscount Hachijo had joined the Communist Party organization. In early January, a dozen more people were arrested. On February 2nd, the Communist Party's organization was destroyed again at Yoshida Station at the foot of Mount Fuji. It was then learned that Communist Party members were still continuing to establish a new central headquarters, and planned to hold a national party congress in mid-March. After the arrest of Mikura, the Japanese police became even more nervous. On February 3rd, in Urawa Town, Saitama Prefecture, Tokyo Imperial University student Tateshina Tamotsu was found to be responsible for rebuilding the Communist Youth League, reorganizing the Youth League within the university and in various places. Communist Party members in Nagano Prefecture planned to hold an anti-war demonstration on National Foundation Day on February 11th, but were arrested on the 4th before the event could take place.</p>
<p>Sawada Kyuji and more than 30 others were arrested, including female silk workers, elementary school teachers, members of farmers' associations, members of virgin associations, and members of youth groups. Takeuchi Koheiji, an English student at Waseda University, and Murata Shunichi, a student at the First Commercial College, and three others were also arrested during the small group expansion movement. Ono Yoshihiko, the son of Major General Ono Yukikichi, the brigade commander of the 18th Brigade of the 9th Division, was a leader within the First Higher School. Due to the Japanese police's urgent pursuit, he moved several times and was arrested on January 28th in Kikui, Ushigome Ward. The above are all public facts, and there are countless more that have not dared to be made public. It can be seen that the red flames in Japan are developing fiercely with the expansion of the war by the militarists.</p>
<p>(Hwa-lien, Tokyo) In issue 1535 of the Toyo Keizai Shimpo, there is an article on ["What Kind of Awareness Should Japan Have When the League of Nations Reaches the Worst Point?"]. The gist of it is that Japan's policy toward the League of Nations is based on the principle that the Manchurian Incident was an exercise of the right to self-defense, and that the independence of "Manchukuo" and the Japanese government's recognition of it cannot be revoked. If this policy is not compromised at the appropriate time, a head-on conflict with the League of Nations is inevitable. Then, after the conflict, will Japan resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations, or will it adopt a roundabout policy? It is difficult for us to predict at present. However, the League of Nations still has the power to sanction Japan a second time, and this power is enough to trigger a world war. Under this state, although the politicians constantly use the name of emergency to prepare for war on a large scale, and actively change the political and economic organization under the capitalist system in politics, attempting a final try, but according to our observations, the main problem is not external. We believe that what will follow the world war is the social revolution of the proletariat. Looking at the vitality of the Japanese Communist Party's activities today, although Japan, which has always prided itself on being a world police state, not only cannot effectively suppress the domestic communist movement, but on the contrary, the spread of national reddening is getting worse and worse, and the authorities have no way to deal with it. The current situation is already like this, but if a war breaks out, who can guarantee that Japan will not have a second Lenin succeeding Kerensky? In short, if the authorities do not estimate that there are forces in Japan similar to Lenin and Stalin, then they cannot claim to be leaders who know themselves and their enemies. To put it bluntly, Japanese diplomacy has reached the worst point. Judging from the current domestic situation, it is bound to move from parliamentary politics to fascist politics, followed by the emerging proletarian revolution in the country. The Japanese authorities should have this kind of awareness in order to use the current policy to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute and the entire diplomatic strategy.</p>

<p>Master Neng Hai Talks About His Return from Tibet</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama Have No Ill Will</p>
<p>Attached to the Inner Court Earnestly, Not Absolutely Pro-British</p>
<p>Only the People of Sichuan and Tibet Have Too Little Connection</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Sichuan and Tibet have a deep relationship in terms of history and geography. Only because of the inconvenience of transportation, all true news cannot be spread. In recent years, the troops stationed in Xikang and the British side have used one-sided news as propaganda because of other effects, resulting in the alienation of the feelings of the Han and Tibetan people, and the concept of hostility has increased. Master Neng Hai, who went to Tibet from Sichuan four years ago, has newly returned from Tibet and is stationed in Chongqing. He knows a lot about the situation in Tibet. The record of his conversation is as follows: "I (Neng Hai) went to Tibet from Chengdu in the summer of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, and went to Lhasa (the capital of Tibet) via Tatsienlu. Because the mountain road was rugged, it took more than eighty days to reach the Tibetan border. The people in Tibet have very good feelings for the Han people and have no hostile mentality at all. Although some young people who have studied in Britain have tried their best to advocate anti-Hanism, the general Tibetan people have a long historical relationship with the Han people, and it is difficult for ten out of a hundred people to be affected. As for the Tibetan government, it does not treat Han merchants abusively. There are still hundreds of Han people who stay in Tibet to do business. All kinds of duties and errands are still in accordance with the old rules of the Qing Dynasty, and Han people are not assigned. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, who are in power in Tibet, have no disagreement. In religion, the Dalai Lama is also the preceptor of the Panchen Lama. The reason for the subsequent bad feelings and conflicts, as far as my investigation is concerned, is that before the Panchen Lama left Tibet, the Dalai Lama allowed the British to open a concession in Gyantse. The Panchen Lama repeatedly obstructed and refused to listen, so he expressed his dissatisfaction. Later, the Dalai Lama, who led the Panchen Lama, also tried his best to settle his own personal line, so that the Panchen Lama's line could not stand. Those around Panchen Lama then encouraged Panchen Lama to plot revenge, and those around the Dalai Lama also tried their best to reject Panchen Lama from Dalai Lama because Panchen Lama wanted to restore his original status, which led to the current situation. In fact, the two people themselves have no estrangement. For many years, the Panchen Lama's entourage has been constantly attacking each other. This point is called predestination in our monks. Sometimes Panchen Lama's predestination with the Chinese is exhausted, and he will naturally be understood by Dalai Lama, and he will return to Tibet. At this time, we don't need to worry too much. It is rumored that Dalai Lama is old, and most of those who hold military power are pro-British factions. Once he unfortunately returns to the case, China will have more troubles. In fact, there are still some problems to be studied. The result is that rumors may eventually become rumors. According to the Tibetan system, although Dalai Lama is the supreme head of the unified political and religious powers, after his death, no matter who the second generation reincarnates into, he must be given a dharma name by a supreme elder, and only after the Dalai Lama in the next generation becomes an adult after twenty years can he be formally granted a position. During the twenty-year transition period, political and religious powers are all handled by this supreme elder. Who is this elder? It is the Tushita in Indian sounds and the Hadden Chiba in Tibetan sounds. This elder is one of the Tibetan official titles, but its qualifications are extremely strict. It is extremely difficult to obtain without the best results in Exoteric and Esoteric Buddhism. The current retired Hadden Chiba is still alive and is a native of a county in the border area of Sichuan. His knowledge and ability can surpass ordinary monks, and he strongly supports pro-Hanism. If Dalai Lama dies, this monk will take charge of political and religious power on behalf of Dalai Lama. The Tibetan system is consistent, and there will be no disputes. After Dalai Lama's death, the relationship between Han and Tibet will undoubtedly become closer. Recently, the lives of Tibetans have been several times more expensive than before due to the influence of external forces. The general people have been complaining incessantly, and those who are inclined to the inner court blame the authorities for this. In fact, Dalai Lama has always been attached to the Han, but the Han army was not good at coping, which made him feel extremely disappointed. He may have had business dealings with the British in peacetime, but it is not true history to say that Dalai Lama is absolutely pro-British. Dalai Lama is a person who is rich in ethnic ideology. His refusal to allow the British to communicate the Indo-Tibetan railway can be used to measure his inner tendency. The population of Tibet is difficult to know for sure because there has never been a system. However, Tibetans tend to regard monks as honorable. All their children who are relatively smart are sent to temples to worship Buddha. In families with many children, it is okay to send two-thirds or one-third. Even those with as few as one child are often sent away. Therefore, from this point of view, monks should be more than lay people. As for women, they also worship Buddha a lot, but their method is not like men, who must enter a temple to do so. Shaving their hair and receiving ordination, and opening a Buddhist hall at home, is considered a complete procedure, and it is not necessary to visit the temple. The people of Sichuan and Tibet have too little connection. In the whole of Tibet, there are only eight or nine people. Compared with the more than 2,000 people in Mongolia, it is really just a drop in the bucket. In the future, we should publicize as much as possible to allow Sichuan monks to enter Tibet more, in order to communicate the feelings of Sichuan and Tibet and avoid estrangement. (February 13)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Severe Situation of the Shaanxi Disaster <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>More Than 19 Counties Without a Disaster-Free County</p>
<p>Remains and White Bones are Everywhere</p>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence: Shaanxi Province has been suffering from drought for years, and there have been no harvests for five years. The disaster area is wide, covering the entire province. The severity of the disaster is unbearable to hear. The area includes the three districts of Guanzhong, Yulin, and Hannan, with more than 90 counties, none of which are disaster-free, and the counties in Guanzhong are particularly severe. The tragic situation is that wives and children are sold, graves are dug and houses are demolished, trees are peeled and grass is eaten, and entire families commit suicide. They are still displaced and wandering, and their situation is extremely miserable. The current situation is that villages are full of ruins, rooms have no complete tiles, and remains and white bones are everywhere. The severity of the disaster is the worst among all provinces and regions. Fortunately, the autumn rains last year were timely and some planting was obtained, but since planting wheat, there has been no rain, and the drought has continued to this day. The wheat seedlings have withered, and the fate of the disaster area is even more unimaginable. The disaster situation and urgent need for relief in various places are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Li Min in Shang County Have No Way to Survive: After Li Fei Changgeng ravaged Longju Village and Zhulin Pass in the county, the situation is even more miserable. The houses are all scenes of rubble, and fertile soil has become a beach of wasteland. There is no clothes or food, and cold snow is on the ground. At this time of year when the old grain has been eaten and the new grain has not yet been harvested, there is even less way to survive, so I hope that various charitable groups will find ways to provide relief to avoid death.</p>
<p>The Great Disaster of Baoji: The Cries Shake the Sky: Since the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the county has been suffering from drought for years, and the harvest has been poor every time. The refugees are everywhere, and the people are not living. The grass roots and tree bark have been searched and eaten up. The strong men have fled to distant places, and the old and weak have mostly starved to death. The fields are barren, and the villages are in ruins. Last year, the tiger epidemic was prevalent, and even more people died. The widows, widowers, and orphans who remain are suffering unspeakable hardship. Farming tools, cabinets, boxes, house wood, tiles, and bricks have all been sold, which is still not enough to maintain the current situation. The people are thin and haggard, begging for food everywhere. The calamity is vast, and the cries shake the sky. Even a heart of stone will shed tears. Now the weather is cold and the wind is cold, which is enough to shorten the lives of those who cry in hunger and cold. Without benevolent millet and righteous oars, it is difficult to save this urgent situation.</p>
<p>The Disaster Victims of Sanyuan Have No Rice to Cook: Taihe and Gospel Villages in the county suffered a bandit disaster on November 23 last year. More than half of the houses were burned down, and livestock and property were looted. The villagers were scattered and displaced, and fled in all directions. There is a home but it is difficult to return, and there is no rice to cook. During this time of year when the old grain has been eaten and the new grain has not yet been harvested, firewood is expensive and rice is like pearls. Without relief, it is impossible to maintain a livelihood and overcome the difficulties. Sun Yunfang and other citizens of the area have already asked the Provincial Relief Association for relief yesterday.</p>
<p>The Disaster Victims of Lantian Have Lost Their Vitality: The wheat seedlings in the county are dry and withered, and are also buried by yellow dust, with almost no vitality. Most of the houses in the large and small villages have been demolished, and the people are thin and haggard, unable to make a living. Selling houses is无人過問, and selling wives and carrying children, there are few buyers. The rich eat bran every day, and the poor cook and eat locust beans. Recently, locust beans and bran are also unavailable. The rich become poor and the poor die. The strong are unwilling to freeze and starve, and take risks.</p>
<p>The Wheat Seedlings in Mei County are Withering Day by Day: Since the Red Bandits disturbed the county, the beacon fire has been all over the place within 20 miles southwest of the county, and firewood has been exhausted. The rich are impoverished, and the poor have nothing to live on. Every time you enter a village, you don't see fireworks all day long. The Meiwu Ridge area in the north of the county is extremely dry, and it has been hit by frequent disasters for many years, and the water is dry and cannot be irrigated. The summer fields have been poor for six years now, and the difficult situation is difficult to maintain. Now it has not rained for several days, and the wheat seedlings are withering day by day. People are panicked and cannot guarantee their safety in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>The Disaster Victims of Lintong Live on Vegetable Roots: The disaster situation in the county is severe and unprecedented. At present, within dozens of miles around, there is no grain left. Most of them are supporting the old and carrying the young, and begging for food. Those who are old and weak and cannot move dig vegetable roots to survive. Therefore, the families in various villages in the area have not started fires for many days. I hope that benevolent people will have mercy and rescue them.</p>
<p>More Than 100,000 People Died of Starvation in Pucheng: At the turn of winter and spring, the drought is even more severe. The wheat seedlings are dry and withered. Selling wives and changing property, there has been no sale for a long time. More than 100,000 people have fled and starved to death. The wailing of wild geese is everywhere, and the tragic situation is extremely terrible. It is reported that the central government will issue Shaanxi relief. Yang Zhonghu and others from the county's Charity Relief Center have also asked the Provincial Relief Association for relief.</p>
<p>The Villages and Towns of Xianyang Do Not Hear Chickens: The Beiyuan area of the county is full of devastation, and the wailing of wild geese is everywhere. The people have no means to make a living, and they seek in every way, demolishing houses and selling farm implements to survive. Selling wives and children to get a meal is the same for every household. South of the Wei River, there are still children left in the villages closer to the county. In other villages and towns, not only are there few people, but chickens and dogs are not heard. I am afraid that in the future, there will be no living things left in the villages on the plateau. Xu Jiheng, chairman of the County Relief Branch, has submitted a petition to the Provincial Relief Association yesterday, asking for funds for relief.</p>
<p>In the Third District of Yongshou, There is No Smoke from the Households: The third district of the county has been suffering from drought for five years, and there have been no harvests for nine harvests. The people are crying out for hunger and are waiting to be fed. Tree bark and grass roots have been dug and eaten up. The disaster victims carry firewood and sell grass, but the grain they exchange for is repeatedly robbed by bandits on the way. At present, the villages and communities have become ruins, and there is no smoke from the households. Children flee and fathers die, husbands leave and wives die, the strong are scattered in all directions, and the old and weak fill the ditches. If there is no urgent relief, the future is really unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The False Economic Committee Director Zhou Jia Realizes His Error and Defects <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>And Reports to Chen Cheng on His Forced Experiences</p>
<p>A Bandit Life from Hunan through Jiangxi to Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Zhou Shanjia, Director of the Economic Committee of the Political Affairs Office of the Pseudo 22nd Army of the Communist Bandits, defected to the Headquarters of the 14th Division of the National Army in Huwan on January 31st. After being interrogated by the division, it was determined that he sincerely desired to reform, and he was transferred to the Frontline Command Headquarters for reception. Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng, recognizing that Zhou Shanjia came from the bandits' den and had experienced deep stimulation, personally comforted him and ordered him to assist in propaganda work in the rehabilitation team as a sign of preferential treatment. Here is a record of his defection report, word for word, to show the situation of the Communist bandits. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>[Submitted for Clarification of Defection, Requesting Exemption from Prosecution, Originally Coerced Communist Bandit Zhou Shanjia, from Anshan District, Chen County, Hunan, currently 34 years old, during the Communist bandit disaster in Hunan in the 17th year of the Republic, the local bandit leader Lei Mingxuan, Qinmin, etc., led dozens of Red bandits from Chen County to the district to organize guerrilla teams and a pseudo-district government. Initially, Jia was forced to be the secretary of the guerrilla team. Later, when the pseudo-district government was established, Jia was forced to be a member of the confiscation committee of the pseudo-district government, with Deng Daocheng as the director of the confiscation committee. Before a few days had passed, Jia was forced to go to the pseudo-government training class in Chen County for training. After two weeks, Jia was forced to work in the tenth district of Chen County. Before five days had passed, the National Army pursued from Guangdong, and Jia had no choice but to follow the bandit army across Jiangxi. Arriving at Ci Ping in Jiangxi, because too many people from southern Hunan followed, and also because there were too many empty-handed elderly, young, and women, Zhu the bandit ordered the people from southern Hunan to return to southern Hunan. Jia then followed back to southern Hunan. Zhu the bandit also sent a regiment of Red bandits to Songzhi in Shuikou, Jiangxi. The people from southern Hunan, arriving in the Sandu area of southern Hunan, dispersed the weapons to the people of various counties, and Jia then fled back home. He hid in a relative's home ten miles from home. Upon hearing that he could not return home, he fled to You County, Hunan, and worked as a shop assistant for about two years. He heard that he was still not allowed to return home. At that time, Peng the bandit and others brought disaster to Hunan, and the pseudo-12th Army was stationed in You County, Hunan. Jia had no way to make a living and had no home to return to. He had no choice but to follow the bandit army across Jiangxi again. Jia initially served as a clerk in the document section of the Secretariat of the Political Department of the pseudo-12th Army. Arriving in Lianhua County, Jiangxi, Jia was transferred to be a member of the security section of the Political Affairs Department of the pseudo-department. Arriving in Xiajiang County, Jiangxi, Jia was again transferred to be a member of the political affairs organization section. In the 20th year of the Republic, in Tingzhou, Fujian, Jia was again transferred to be the chief of the accounting section of the Political Affairs Department of the pseudo-department. In the 21st year of the Republic, a part of the pseudo-12th Army and the pseudo-22nd Army were merged into the pseudo-22nd Army, and Jia was transferred to be the director of the Economic Committee of the Political Affairs Office of the pseudo-22nd Army, and has been in that position until now. Jia has repeatedly wanted to defect to the National Army, but there was no opportunity, and in the past he was too deeply deceived by the bandit leaders' propaganda. For example, they said that National Army soldiers and officers who caught Red bandits were all executed. Jia initially believed it, but later heard about the defection of Guo Bingsheng, Hou Zhongying, and the manager and office chief of the Pseudo Third Army Regiment, etc. Flyers and leaflets were dropped by airplanes, which were picked up by the Red bandits, and Jia realized that it was true that the National Army treated Red bandit prisoners, officers, and soldiers favorably. Later, the bandit leaders learned that every officer and soldier in the bandit army knew that the National Army not only did not kill Guo, Hou, etc., but also treated Guo, Hou, and others very favorably. In this way, the Red bandits' deceptive propaganda was completely bankrupt. Therefore, in order to save their bankrupt deceptive propaganda, the Red bandits issued a set of anti-Kuomintang propaganda guidelines, wanting to continue to deceive the officers and soldiers in the bandit army. For example, they said that the National Army did not kill Guo Bingsheng, etc., but only temporarily used them for a period of time, and would secretly kill them one by one in the future, and that Hou Zhongying had already been secretly killed by the National Army, and so on. Jia now sees through that the Communist bandits rely solely on deceptive propaganda to incite the masses. Moreover, this time there was an opportunity to defect, so on January 25th, Jia hid in the home of the fake local tyrant Zuo Qichang, who had been released by Jia, for six days. Jia gave Zuo Qichang 16 silver dollars. On the 31st, Jia heard that the National Army had reached Langju, 40 miles from Zuo Qichang's house in Zuo Fangying. On that day, he went to Langju and then to Huwan, where he met the National Army. Jia made a defection report at Zuo Qichang's house and presented it to the commander of the 14th Division, and also reported to the headquarters of the 14th Division what Jia knew about the situation of the Communist bandits. Therefore, I am submitting this to clarify my defection and request exemption from prosecution. Promoting the preferential treatment of defecting Red bandits is truly virtuous. Respectfully submitted to Chen, the Frontline Commander of the Fuzhou River. Respectfully submitted by the defecting Communist bandit Zhou Shanjia. February 3rd.</p>

<p>The Department of Finance Dispatches Personnel to Urge Payment of Business Tax: Director Shu of the Suzhou Department of Finance believes that various businesses in Wuxian are taking a wait-and-see attitude regarding business tax, and shops have not yet filled out tax returns. All taxes from the autumn and winter seasons of last year have not been cleared. Therefore, on the 14th, he instructed the Wuxian Business Tax Bureau to collect all tax amounts from the autumn and winter seasons of last year within this month and to begin collecting the spring tax amounts. At the same time, he dispatched a committee with the Suzhou Provincial Business Federation to send personnel to Suzhou to urge various businesses. For this reason, the County Chamber of Commerce has specially scheduled a meeting of representatives from various businesses on the 17th of this month to encourage them to pay taxes.</p>

<p>Will Raise 2 Million Yuan in Membership Fees</p>
<p>Donations from All Quarters Are Very Enthusiastic</p>
<p>After the Chinese Aviation Association appointed Mayor Wu Wang Rutang as the general director of the fundraising team and general staff officer, it discussed the organization of various fundraising teams with the standing directors at the municipal government at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Lin Wojiang, Wang Tingsong, and others were present, chaired by Wu Tiecheng and recorded by Li Dachao. After detailed discussion, it was decided to organize 200 teams, each team aiming to raise a minimum of 10,000 yuan. It is estimated that the city can collect more than 2 million yuan in membership fees. The candidates for team leaders have been decided for more than 100 people, and the rest can be completely decided in about one or two days.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Lin Wojiang Speaks <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Lin Wojiang, a standing director of the Chinese Aviation Association, told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday that since the January 28th Aviation Patriotic Movement Week, the aviation movement has spread throughout the country. Provinces, cities, and counties have initiated fundraising to purchase aircraft. In the future, the focus of this association will be on unifying the management and use of donations from various places and on the overall plan for purchasing and preparing aircraft. Aviation is related to national defense and is not merely about purchasing a certain number of aircraft. It must be closely related to national defense arrangements. Otherwise, competing in ungoverned establishment, chaotic and numerous arrangements will be of no practical benefit and will be the same as the navy before the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, seeking unity is the most important task of this association, and a method has now been drafted. Lin Wojiang said that the chances of winning or losing in air force operations are similar to those of the navy, that is, the number of aircraft cannot differ too greatly. Otherwise, fighting with fewer against many will undoubtedly lead to defeat. Napoleon once said that he must always ensure that the military strength of his unit exceeds that of the enemy. This is the primary condition for victory. Even if the total military strength at a certain time is not as good as that of the enemy, the combat portion must be superior to the enemy. The construction of China's air force, compared with Japan, which currently has 1,500 to 1,600 aircraft, requires China to have at least 1,000 aircraft in order to strategically operate properly and achieve victory. During the January 28th Shanghai Battle last year, more than 120 Japanese air force planes came to Shanghai. Therefore, China's limited number of aircraft could not play a role. If they were forced to fight, they would all be destroyed. Moreover, the composition of China's existing air force is very complex. Some were war trophies captured during the Northern Expedition, of different types. Some were purchased successively and are not unified. The difficulty is the same as the complexity of firearms in the army, which is difficult to replenish and reduces combat effectiveness. In addition, there is another important case, which is to select and train pilots. The association has discussed this, and there are also designs for opening an aviation factory. Overseas Chinese have been sending letters and making inquiries to organize branch associations for several days, and some have criticized the association for not paying attention to the development of overseas association affairs. In fact, the association has not been established for a long time, and the organization of branch associations must be promoted in sequence.</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters News: Guomin News Agency reported that the municipal party headquarters has discussed the aviation donation method in the executive committee on the previous day. As a result, it was decided that all committee members and staff would donate the amount stipulated by the National Government's Executive Yuan in six months and collect it within two months to show their advocacy.</p>
<p>Fundraising for Women's Team: Liu Wang Liming, the general director of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, and others plan to raise funds with their colleagues to purchase a "Women's Aircraft." They sent a letter to Mayor Wu asking about the grade and price of the aircraft. The original letter is as follows: "Mayor Wu, With respect, I am writing to you because I believe that the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent and aviation is essential for saving the country today. Therefore, I plan to raise funds with my colleagues to purchase a "Women's Aircraft." However, before proceeding, I would like to know the different grades of aircraft and the price of each ordinary aircraft so that I can start the process. I am taking the liberty of writing this letter to inquire. I hope to receive your reply. Sincerely, Liu Wang Liming." Mayor Wu forwarded the letter to the association yesterday and replied to Madam Liu, stating briefly that there are two types of aircraft: military and civilian. Military aircraft are divided into pursuit, reconnaissance, bombing, and combat. Considering the current needs of the air force, pursuit and bombing are urgent. Each aircraft costs approximately between 100,000 and 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Purchasing a Children's Aircraft: The Chinese Children's Welfare Association is planning to promote children's donations to purchase a "Children's Aircraft" to save the country and provide it for national use on April 4, which is Children's Sports Day. On the 10th, they sent a letter to the association asking for guidance. On the 11th, the association sent Tian Hao, a propaganda group staff member, to contact Wu Weide, the director-general of the Children's Welfare Association, and Chen Tiesheng, the deputy director-general. Tian first stated: 1. It is hoped that the association will pay attention to encouraging children's patriotic spirit, which is more important than purchasing aircraft. 2. The Children's Welfare Association should be responsible for planning all the progress, but please notify the Aviation Association of the decision-making methods. 3. Purchasing an aircraft costs approximately 110,000 yuan. If there is any surplus, it is hoped that it will be donated to the aviation factory fund. 4. It is hoped that the Children's Welfare Association will join the Aviation Association as a group member. The two directors-general Wu and Chen completely accepted the first three items, and the fourth item will be decided after consideration. They also requested the Aviation Association to quickly determine the specific details of purchasing aircraft and building factories, and to ensure that donations for purchasing aircraft are not used for internal warfare.</p>
<p>Donations from All Quarters: Yesterday, the association received letters from outside the city to join the association, including 19 people from the Zhengzhou District Court in Henan Province (including 4 special members).

<p>Feng Yuxiang is Determined to Resist Japan</p>
<p>But the Date of Going South Has Not Been Decided</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the Central Government previously sent Central Committee member Wang Faqin north to urge Feng Huanzhang to go to Beijing to discuss national affairs. Feng sent Huang Shaogu as his representative to go to Beijing with Wang Faqin to convey Feng's opinions on resisting Japan. It is now learned that Wang Faqin and Huang Shaogu arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. They drove to visit Xue Dubi and many others. According to Xue, Huanzhang's attitude towards resisting Japan has always been firm, but the date of going south has not yet been determined. Feng has expressed to others that if the central government decides on a plan to resist Japan, he will go to Beijing immediately. Zhang Zhijiang said that Feng Huanzhang had previously sent Deng Zhexi as his representative to go south to convey Feng's opinions on resisting Japan. He had met Deng in Shanghai and learned that Feng had always advocated resisting Japan. If the central government's overall plan to resist Japan is decided, Feng can temporarily go south, obey the command of the central government, and engage in anti-Japanese work, regardless of any sacrifice. Deng has now gone to Jiangxi to visit Commander-in-Chief Chiang and convey Feng's opinions. As for Feng's plan to resist Japan, it is said that he has given it to Wang Faqin and Huang Shaogu to take to Beijing and present it to the central government for adoption.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Rehabilitation of Northern Shanghai <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Opinions of Real Estate Operators</p>
<p>Reply from the Real Estate Association</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that since the January 28th Incident, the area of real estate destroyed in this city has reached more than 1.2 million square meters, with a value of more than 40 million yuan. To date, less than one-tenth has been repaired. In order to revitalize northern Shanghai, the municipal government plans to find ways to support the economy of citizens so that prosperity can be restored as soon as possible. The newspapers have all reported this, but the problem is quite complex. Yesterday, the reporter conducted a detailed study with real estate experts familiar with this city. According to them, real estate in this city was not very liquid economically before the war because the financial community was unwilling to mortgage Chinese real estate. Even within the boundaries of the extra-territorial road construction, few people invested. The initial reason was that when Sun Chuanfang's troops arrived in Shanghai in the fourth and fifth years of the Republic of China, they occupied the houses in the Jiangwan area. At this time, Jiangwan was in a period of enthusiastic construction and was hit by this. Afterwards, no one invested in the area. Another reason is that after the revolutionary army came, Chinese residents often resisted landlords and did not pay rent according to the contract, causing landlords to be unable to obtain ordinary interest. This is because residents have a too shallow vision and are bound by current interests, not knowing that in the invisible, they are forcing capital to invest in the concessions. The concessions have higher taxes and higher land prices, and the rent charged is naturally more expensive. Isn't it the residents who are losing out? Fortunately, the municipal government has seen this and is now paying attention to solving this kind of dispute, which is the most urgent task. Some people say that the price of land in the Chinese area, no matter what, cannot be higher than the concessions, and construction cannot be more prosperous than the concessions. This is not entirely true. Look at Guangzhou, which is not a Chinese city. The land price along the Bund is comparable to the concessions in Shanghai. The reason is that the financial community is willing to mortgage and the economy is very liquid. Therefore, the municipal government's intention to support the people and increase construction is very good. It is also necessary for the people to be aware that residents should not make unnecessary disputes, and the financial community should advocate investing as much as possible, so that some landlords with design capabilities can build their own houses. The rest, who cannot afford to recover, will be helped by the municipal government. Then the entire post-war reconstruction of the war zone can be solved.</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that regarding the problem of the decline in land prices in Zhabei after the war, the Shanghai Real Estate Association received a letter from lawyer Zhang Yuji yesterday, [Sir, I have found that the decline in land prices in the Zhabei area due to the impact of the war has become an obvious fact. I have also learned that your association sent a letter to lawyer Gan Lin, proving that the land prices in the Zhenqing Lane area of Chuanfen Road were indeed lower than before the war, which shows that your association advocates fairness and I deeply admire it. Now, the land prices in the area opposite Beisichuan Road on the other side of Chuan Highway (ie, Beisichuan Lane and nearby) have declined due to the war. It is necessary to investigate. I hereby write to your association to formally write a letter of proof. I am very grateful for your public friendship.] The association immediately replied, [Re: We received your letter of January 31 regarding the land price situation. Our association's letter to lawyer Gan Lin did not prove that the land prices in the Zhenqing Lane area of Chuan Highway were indeed lower than before the war. Please check accordingly.]</p>

<p>Two Yuan Will Be Used Together Starting Next Month</p>
<p>The Mint Extends the Coinage Period</p>
<p>500 Million Yuan in Cash Is Concentrated</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that regarding the Ministry of Finance's abolition of the tael and changing to the yuan, the Ministry of Railways' laying of double tracks on the Shanghai-Suzhou section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and the general situation of the silver and money circles in this city, the Central News Agency reporter specially obtained detailed information from the banking community in this city yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>Abolition of the Tael and Changing to the Yuan: Regarding the abolition of the tael and changing to the yuan, the Central Mint has scheduled to start minting new coins on March 1. According to the news from the banking community in this city, the tael and the yuan will still be used together at that time. After four months, the tael will be abolished and changed to the yuan. However, it has not yet been determined whether the internal equipment of the factory can be completed as scheduled before March 1.</p>
<p>Borrowing for Track Laying: The Ministry of Railways plans to borrow 2 million yuan from the banking community in this city in order to lay double tracks on the Shanghai-Suzhou section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The banking community in this city expresses deep sympathy for the Ministry of Railways' development of transportation and is willing to assist, but due to the impact of the war, there is a feeling of "the will is there, but the strength is lacking." Moreover, it has not yet been heard that the Ministry of Railways has sent personnel to negotiate with the banking community. The two railroads have a debt relationship with the China-British Bank Corporation, and this loan may still be undertaken by the company, or it may be borrowed from foreign merchant banks.</p>
<p>Financial Situation: The current situation of the silver and money circles in this city has long been trending towards tightening since the September 18th and January 28th Incidents. Cash from all over the country is concentrated in this city. According to a recent survey, the cash currently held in Shanghai has reached 300 million yuan and 10 million taels, totaling 500 million yuan. The reason for the tightening is that the Northeast Incident cannot be resolved immediately. As for the abnormal development of the banking community in the concessions, it cannot last.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Two Groups in Shanghai East Oppose the Water Meter System <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Citizens Can't Bear the Burden</p>
<p>Dividends Already Sufficiently Distributed</p>
<p>The Yangshupu 19th District Branch of the Citizens' Association and the Shanghai East Businessmen's Association jointly issued a declaration yesterday opposing the water company's disguised price increase through meter billing. The declaration stated: "For decades, the water fee in the Public Concession has been based on the 'package water system,' which charges 5% of the house rent as the standard. This method is fair and thoughtful, and has been followed for a long time because it adjusts for wealth and poverty and suits our national conditions. However, over the past twenty years, house rents have continued to rise, and water fees have also increased accordingly, to a considerable amount. Since the fee is based on house rent, there should be no further increase in the standard. However, in the 16th year, the water company, citing the high price of silver and insufficient dividends, increased the fee to 6%. In the 18th year, it further increased it to 7.5%. Subsequently, after opposition and protests from the Real Estate Association, it was agreed that once the British exchange rate reached two shillings, the fee should revert to the old rate, with a temporary payment of 7.5%. However, this kind of price increase is both explicit and implicit, directly increasing the burden on landlords and indirectly on citizens, which has already made it unbearable for citizens. Moreover, the water company's dividends are already sufficient for distribution. Unexpectedly, the water company is insatiably greedy. The year before last, it again cited the lack of shareholder dividends and requested American experts to examine and determine how to reduce water installation costs and control waste, and changed to installing water meters. Since the installation of meters, water fees have skyrocketed, especially in our Eastern District. The Eastern District is an industrial area with small houses and many people, so high water usage is a natural phenomenon. There are even cases where the water fee exceeds the house rent. Therefore, landlords, with the fact that meter billing has severed the connection with house rent, should install one meter per household and directly collect fees from tenants, deducting the 'package water fee' from the rent, which is also reasonable. However, if this becomes a reality, and the income of laborers is limited, they will not be able to afford this expensive water fee and will inevitably reduce usage as much as possible, leaving what should be washed unwashed, which affects overall hygiene. How can a civilized society produce such a thing? Therefore, our association is extremely opposed to the water meter system. Furthermore, for a public utility to be able to maintain dividends in this time of city-wide decline is already fortunate. Otherwise, the water company, holding this indispensable element of daily life, will use water cutoffs as a threat to demand whatever it wants. With such power, our citizens will have no means of survival. In addition to sending representatives to the Bureau of Public Works to petition for a ban on water cutoffs, we hereby issue this declaration."</p>

<p>Starting March 1st, Remittance of Taels Will Resume</p>
<p>A Decision Will Be Made After the Implementation of Abolishing Taels and Changing to Yuan</p>
<p>The Banking Association's Joint Reserve Committee, which also handles the clearing house, has been handling the clearing of silver yuan since its opening on January 10th, and the remittance of silver yuan since February 1st. It was originally scheduled to resume the clearing of silver taels from the 16th and the remittance of silver taels from March 1st, so that the exchange of the four currencies could be completed. However, with the imminent implementation of abolishing taels and changing to yuan, a meeting was required to discuss and decide whether to continue the clearing and remittance of silver taels. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited the person in charge of the clearing house yesterday and learned that because the use of both silver taels and silver yuan would be temporarily permitted at the beginning of the abolition of taels and change to yuan, the clearing house would continue handling the clearing of silver taels from February 16th and resume the remittance of silver taels from March 1st as usual. A temporary meeting would be held after the implementation of abolishing taels and changing to yuan to see the extent of the abolition and make any necessary changes.</p>

<p>Not a Negotiation Regarding Japanese Protests of Chinese Troops Passing Through Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a Japanese newspaper in this city reported yesterday that Chinese troops passing through Shanghai on the 7th of this month was a clear violation of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement signed on May 5th of last year. Therefore, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Ishii Itaro, had once gone to the municipal government to lodge a protest. Yu Hongjun, a member of the Chinese side of the Joint Committee, visited Consul-General Ishii at the Japanese Consulate-General's office yesterday (the 13th) at noon and held a meeting for one hour. As a result of the talks, Committee Member Yu agreed to notify the Japanese side in advance of any future Chinese troops passing through Shanghai. A reporter inquired about this with Mr. Yu yesterday morning, and Mr. Yu firmly denied it, saying that his visit to the Japanese Consul-General on the 13th was merely a courtesy call. The newspaper's report was not true. Mr. Yu also said that although the Bureau of Public Works had expressed opposition to factory inspections within the concession, negotiations were still underway.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Implementation Period for Marking Imported Goods <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Agrees to Postpone to August 1st</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance stipulated that the "Regulations on Marking the Country of Origin of Imported Goods" had been formulated and promulgated by the National Government. An order was issued to the Inspector General of Customs and the superintendents of various customs houses to comply with them upon the specified date. Now, the ministry has received a telegram from the Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Maze, requesting that the "Regulations on Marking the Country of Origin of Imported Goods" should be complied with. However, the implementation date may be slightly rushed. In order to avoid various difficulties, could it be changed to six months after February 1st (i.e., August 1st) for implementation? The ministry, upon receiving the telegram, considered that the requested implementation six months after February 1st differed from the implementation date stipulated in Article 5 of the original regulations by only one month. In order to avoid difficulties in implementation, it should be approved. In addition to ordering the Customs Administration to forward the order for compliance, it was also submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and presentation to the National Government for the record.</p>

<p>The Northeastern Refugee Relief Association Urges Donations</p>
<p>And Asks All Directors to Quickly Plan Emergency Relief Measures</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Shanghai Charitable Organizations' Joint Northeastern Refugee Relief Association believes that as the war expands and persists, the number of Northeastern compatriots suffering from the disaster is increasing, and the need for relief is becoming more urgent. Yesterday, it sent separate letters to the association's promoters, directors, and supervisors, requesting that they quickly raise donations of more than 500 yuan within two weeks to provide emergency relief. Fearing that the amount would be limited, it also sent letters to various agencies and organizations that had received donation booklets, urging them to raise funds. The two letters are recorded below.</p>
<p>Urgently Raising Relief Funds: The association sent a letter yesterday to the association's promoters, directors, and supervisors, stating: "Greetings. Since our association began raising funds for the relief of Northeastern refugees, we have set up offices in Peiping and Tianjin and publicly appointed our Standing Director Qu Wenliu and Standing Director Feng Yangshan to personally go to Peiping, Changchun, Harbin, Qinhuangdao, and other areas to investigate and provide relief, saving many lives. Recently, due to the violent Japanese occupation of Yuguan and the disturbance of the hot border, the number of compatriots suffering from the disaster has increased again. Currently, Standing Director Qu has returned from the front line and reported that he personally saw refugees living in dugouts and makeshift huts, or even sleeping in the open. With the ice frozen and the ground cracked, men, women, old, and young were all hugging each other for warmth. They had no clothes or food, and in the deep of night, with the strong wind, they often died. The living had no homes, and the dead were unburied. The scene was full of devastation and frequently reached the brink of desperation. If we do not continue to send large amounts of money for relief, they will inevitably fill the ravines. The association listened to this tragic situation with extreme heartache. In addition to appointing Standing Director Feng to immediately take the existing relief funds and go north again to continue the investigation and relief, and publishing appeals in newspapers and sending letters to home and abroad to widely solicit donations, we are deeply concerned that donations from various places will not be delivered in time, and delay will not help the emergency. Therefore, at the 11th meeting of the Standing Committee of our association on the 12th of this month, it was resolved that the members of our association should be responsible for raising a certain amount of donations, at least 500 yuan or more per person, with a time limit of two weeks, and the amount will be recorded. We have long admired your enthusiasm for charity and your willingness to do what is right. Moreover, the Northeastern disaster is unprecedented, and relief is difficult to delay. We are sure that you will be happy to assist. We have enclosed a donation booklet (a copy of the case is enclosed for your reference and handling). Saving these mourful people is a work of immeasurable merit."</p>
<p>Urging Fundraising: The Association sent a letter yesterday to the provinces and municipalities that had previously received donation booklets and various agencies and organizations: "Greetings. Because the Northeastern compatriots have suffered repeated war disasters and floods, the tragic situation is unprecedented. Joint relief is an urgent matter for the people of our country. We have previously sent you donation booklets and sincerely requested your generous donation. We assume that you have noted our mercy. Now, we have repeatedly received reports from the offices stationed in the Northeast and the relief personnel in the Northeast that the disaster area in the three Northeastern provinces is vast, the number of refugees is large, and the war disaster and floods have caused repeated disasters. If relief is not provided quickly, they will fill the ditches and not a single one will be saved. The matter concerns disaster relief and national salvation, and we hope that you will not hesitate to do what is needed. We hereby write another letter, respectfully hoping that you will consider the Northeastern compatriots suffering from the disaster. If they are not rescued, they will die; if rescue is delayed, they will also die. Quickly transfer the donations that have been raised to our association, and continue to solicit donations for those that have not yet been raised, so that they can be continuously supplied. Saving them from imminent danger is our utmost hope. We respectfully wish you well."</p>

<p>During the National Crisis, We Should Work Together in Unity</p>
<p>Work Hard to Increase Production</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to the various trade associations, stating: "Greetings. According to the resolutions of the second session of the representatives' conference of our chamber of commerce, please inform the members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various domestic goods factories and organizations that during this period of national crisis, do not close factories or dismiss workers on the pretext of anything. We should embrace the spirit of labor-management cooperation and jointly save the country from danger. Based on this, we have found that in various factories and businesses in this city, management often harbors prejudices and is quite jealous of workers organizing unions. They often dismiss workers on the pretext of anything and even close factories to lay off workers. As a result, serious disputes have arisen, which is not uncommon. If we do not make efforts to correct this, it will greatly harm the lives of workers and affect social order. In light of the aforementioned situation, in addition to instructing the various unions to inform all workers to embrace the spirit of labor-management cooperation, work hard, and step up production during this period of national crisis, we hereby write to your association to inform all members to act in the same way, cooperate sincerely, and prevent disputes and save the country from danger, which is our sincere hope. Therefore, we have prepared this letter to inform you, hoping that you will take note."</p>

<p>Merchants Penalized Can Apply for a Review</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously reported that the stamp tax bureau's penalties for failure to affix stamps were causing disturbances to merchants, and specially requested the Ministry of Finance to issue the implementation procedures submitted by the Shandong Bureau to all provinces for guidance, and to slightly change the penalty procedures of the Review Committee. Now, it is learned that the Ministry of Finance has already approved the order. The original text is recorded below: "The report has been noted. The inspection of stamps must be handled carefully in conjunction with the local police, and there must be no rummaging through boxes and chests and arbitrary disturbances. This Ministry has repeatedly ordered the provincial bureaus to forward instructions to their subordinates to comply with this. As for the request to leave a period of hesitation after the penalty is imposed, and if the penalized person states an objection and there are indeed reasons, a review may be conducted. This is in accordance with the purpose of Article 4 of the Brief Regulations of the Review Committee for Cases of Violation of Stamp Tax Regulations promulgated by the Ministry. In order to give the parties an opportunity to defend themselves, this may be followed. The Jiangsu Stamp and Alcohol Tax Bureau has been ordered to revise Article 4 of the Brief Regulations of the Jiangsu Provincial Review Committee to stipulate that in cases reviewed and determined by the County Review Committee, if the penalized merchants or multiple plaintiffs believe that there are doubts, they may state concrete reasons within fifteen days from the date of delivery of the determination letter and submit them to the Provincial Bureau for forwarding to the Provincial Review Committee for review. At the same time, the original Review Committee should be notified, and the original case should be executed if the deadline is exceeded.] In addition, a second item should be added to the same article, stating: [For cases reviewed by the Provincial Committee, the original review records should be consulted, and the cancellation or maintenance of the original judgment should be submitted to the Provincial Bureau for instruction to the original Review Committee, and the original presenter should be notified. However, after the Provincial Committee's decision, no further objections may be raised.] All such statements have been approved for the record. You should immediately forward this notice to the province for their information."</p>

<p>According to the Great America Evening News, the points of contention between the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works regarding the implementation of the cross-boundary road construction telephone contract were unanimously decided at the Municipal Council meeting last night (the 13th), and a compromise plan was offered. It is found that the Shanghai Telephone Company estimates that the amount of money to be paid to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau for cross-boundary road construction telephones is about 27,000 taels per year. The Municipal Council now advocates that about half of this amount can be paid by the Shanghai Telephone Company from the revised telephone bill deposit item. In practice, this amount will be borne by all users in the two concessions in the future. As for how to raise the remaining slightly more than half of the amount, it will be up to the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works and the Shanghai Telephone Company to decide. It is also heard that the Municipal Council's decision is purely for the sake of friendship and cannot be regarded as a precedent in the future. In other words, the method of bearing half of the amount from the revised telephone bill deposit item will only be implemented for one year, and then another method will be expected to be negotiated. As for the reason why the Municipal Council opposed the company bearing this additional cost, it is said that the reason is that the cross-boundary road construction areas are all outside the Public Concession and have nothing to do with the French Concession. Therefore, it is believed that French Concession users should not indirectly share this additional cost. Now that the Municipal Council has negotiated this compromise plan, it is said that the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Bureau of Public Works will be notified within days.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Yijun Wang Shenlu's Telegram Calling for Support <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram yesterday from Wang Shenlu, commander of the 8th Independent Brigade of the Volunteer Army, calling for active support. The original telegram is recorded below: "The Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association forwards to various newspapers and popular organizations in various regions: Our army, since the September 18th Incident, has been formed by students and pure young people from various provinces. It has participated in the Shanghai War together with the 19th Route Army. After going north, it has been stationed on the border, fighting as it goes for several months. It has encountered fierce enemies repeatedly, and its clothing and food are not taken from the local people. Its discipline has long been trusted by the people. The loss of Jiumen has strengthened the determination to recover. The anniversary of the January 28th Incident has further moved the officers and soldiers to anger. The entire army seeks to fight, striving to be the first. The children call out, daring not to stay behind. Therefore, in late January, they advanced to the vicinity of Jiumen, Xiangshui, Tianjiagang, Zhuxionglveziyu and other areas, and were in continuous contact with the enemy's 8th Division. On the 2nd of this month, they divided their forces into three routes to besiege Jiumen. One part detoured through the deep forests and cliffs, exceeding 60 li, and attacked the enemy's left rear Xin Taizi Pass from outside the pass. Another part bypassed Tashan and directly attacked the enemy's right side, the East Old Lord's Temple in Jiumen. All the officers and soldiers chased after the enemy, climbing like monkeys and rushing like deer. At the end of the third watch, everyone climbed together and seized two key passes with one drum of prestige. The enemy became more stubborn, and we became more courageous. At the time of the recovery of the East City, no less than hundreds of enemies were killed. When attacking the main city, which was originally a feigned attack, it was almost dawn. The enemy army outside the pass suddenly launched a fierce counterattack with mountain cannons, machine guns, flares, and human troops. The artillery fire lit up the sky, the shouts shook the ground, the bullets rained down, and flesh and blood flew everywhere. Our army was in a dangerous place and had no reinforcements. Therefore, short weapons were supplemented with bombs, either bypassing behind the enemy or protruding in front of the enemy, taking advantage of their surprise and withdrawing from the dangerous place. It is estimated that only 7 officers and soldiers were killed in action, and more than 100 were slightly and seriously wounded. Although the consumption of materials was huge, the morale of the officers and soldiers became stronger. The battle was fierce and unprecedented when the enemy resisted stubbornly. However, the only weapons that our army relied on to kill the enemy were short knives and bombs. The enemy defended us from several miles away, and we attacked the enemy within a few steps. In addition to resisting tyranny with a sincere heart, there was nothing else to hold on to. Although we failed to hold on to the recovered area, the difficult situation may be understood by the wise. As for our army in recent months, we deeply feel the difficulty because the supplies in the army have been exhausted for a long time, and the people on the border have exhausted their reserves. Coarse grain and food are transported from hundreds of miles away, causing the officers and soldiers to have only one meal every other day, or only one porridge a day. In the fertile areas of the interior, one may not know the poverty inside and outside the Great Wall. The comrades from various provinces who have personally visited the front line and witnessed the situation have many public opinions. Moreover, after this battle, not only the ammunition was exhausted, but also items such as shares, shoes, socks, and medicines were not left. From the perspective of our army, Shenlu has planned ineffectively, and the military strength is insufficient. The strong men with bare hands are fighting against the sharp weapons of the violent Japanese. He deeply feels that he has failed this morale and betrayed the hearts of the people. How dare he emphasize material assistance? He hopes that our compatriots, all the soldiers are intellectuals, have gathered sincerely through thousands of miles of road and dozens of difficult teams to have today. Now, the guns and ammunition are exhausted, the clothes and food are exhausted, the outside is surrounded by enemies, and the inside lacks support. If we do not appeal on their behalf, what is the difference between pushing them into a desperate situation? In Shenlu, the guilt is deeply increased, and in the country, it is also a serious injury to the use of Qi. Report the battle situation and tell the truth. If you are willing to assist the enlisted soldiers, it will not only be a great favor, but also a meritorious service to save the country. Wang Shenlu, commander of the 8th Independent Brigade of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, bows."</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Mediates the Dispute Between the Sugar Industry and the Southern Goods Industry <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>A Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow at 2 PM</p>
<p>After the dispute between the sugar industry, the northern goods industry, and the southern goods industry in the Shanghai United Market for Sugar, Northern Goods, and Southern Miscellaneous Goods over the conversion of the new-style scales, the northern goods industry and the southern goods industry decided to verify the scales today for a fair handling. The sugar industry and the southern goods industry market chamber of commerce decided to conduct mediation tomorrow. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Sugar Industry Congress: After direct consultation between the white sugar industry and the southern goods industry, the southern goods industry requested a discount of 84%, while the sugar industry insisted on a discount of 85%, resulting in no result and dispersal. The Sugar Industry Association held a membership congress yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, chaired by Zheng Zenan, who reported on the progress of negotiations with the southern goods industry. Then, the discussion began on the spot, and it was decided that (1) the new-style scale conversion would maintain the original resolution of the joint market, and (2) Zheng Zenan and Xu Jingfu would be appointed as representatives to attend the mediation meeting of the municipal chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Mediation: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to quickly resolve the dispute between the sugar industry and the southern goods industry over the new-style scale conversion, which resulted in the southern goods industry suspending listing and buying goods from merchants, has decided to convene a mediation meeting between the Sugar Industry Association and the Southern Goods Industry Association in the Chamber of Commerce conference room at 2 PM on the 16th, with Luo Qinghua, director of the business section, presiding. It is heard that the representatives of the Southern Goods Industry Association are Gong Jingyan and Ni Qingfu, and the representatives of the Sugar Industry Association are Zheng Zenan and Xu Jingfu.</p>
<p>Northern Goods Calibration: In the case of the northern goods industry and the southern goods industry, the southern goods industry requested a discount of 86%, while the northern goods industry insisted on a discount of 87%. Currently, the chairman and members of the Northern Goods Industry Association have been appointed to persuade and decided to use the old-style Association scales and the new-style scale conversion in the Kunyuan Bank on Yangxing Street in the French Concession at 3 PM this afternoon. Representatives from both associations will be present to monitor and decide on the notarized conversion number.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Tobacco Exchange Industry Rules are Submitted for the Record <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association submitted a document to the Social Bureau yesterday, stating: "Subject: The industry is chaotic, and the prices are disrupted. It suspends competition, and the association's persuasion is ineffective. Now, it plans to start organizing and requests your bureau to record it and also give strict prohibition to maintain the business. Our association's industry, including the North and South City and the British, French, and American concessions, totals more than 5,000 households. Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident last year, the market has been desolate, and competition has arisen among the various factions. They are earnestly selling at cheap prices and losing blood, accounting for seven or eight out of ten. The association has repeatedly sent personnel to persuade them, but they have all been superficially compliant. Although a price list has been set, most of them have lowered their prices to seek sales. If this continues, the business will go bankrupt. If the association wants to formulate punishment and sanction measures in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the industry rules and submit them to your bureau for judgment, there are too many offenders and it is too cumbersome. Therefore, for the sake of getting to the root of the problem, the association urgently convened a meeting of representatives from all walks of life in the city on the 7th of this month and specially organized a Market Price Organization Committee. In addition to the executive committee members being ex officio members, 15 other members were elected to be solely responsible for handling the matter. It is planned to formulate 13 draft articles of the Market Price Organization Meeting, stipulating various measures, and to specify the amount of the penalty for breach of contract in the draft articles, in order to show the restrictions and to consolidate the situation. However, we are afraid that the bad habit of suspending the brand will not be easy to eliminate during the implementation, which will hinder the general plan. We plan to ask your bureau to issue an instruction to strictly investigate and prohibit it, so that it can be known to every household, and also consult the Public Security Bureau and the courts of the Special Zone, and if the aforementioned situation occurs, allow the association to send it or request legal action to punish the stubborn and appease the good. All of the aforementioned instructions are requested to be drafted by your bureau and issued to the association for publication and submission with the seal affixed. We hereby submit this request, and a copy of the draft articles of the Market Price Meeting is enclosed. We respectfully request your approval for the record and the prompt issue of instructions to strictly investigate and prohibit it, in order to maintain the business, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Petition to Party and Government Organs by Students of the Autonomous Training Institute Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports: Representatives of the Shanghai Local Autonomy Training Institute's student association went to the Municipal Government yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to petition. Secretary Zhang, representing Mayor Wu, received them and promised to convey their intentions to the Mayor in the future. Next, they called on Yu Jun, Chairman of the Autonomy Committee. Chairman Yu was out on official business, so Yuan Xiaobai, Director of General Affairs, met with them instead. Yuan stated that the committee had made all the necessary arrangements for security work. The appointment letters for the district chiefs were issued by the Ministry of Interior in December of last year. The reason the district offices haven't been established immediately is due to a lack of funding. Therefore, the municipal government has specifically called an emergency meeting for tomorrow to find a solution, and it will not allow the matter to be stalled due to a lack of funds. If necessary, they might try implementing autonomy in one district first. At 1:00 PM, the representatives went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where Secretary Yi Huai received them. The representatives raised two points: (1) What attitude does the Municipal Party Headquarters take towards promoting autonomy in this city? (2) It is rumored that the Municipal Government may first trial several districts. What are the opinions of the various committees of the Party Headquarters? Yi stated that the importance of autonomy during the period of political tutelage is well known. If the Municipal Government uses financial difficulties as a reason to delay autonomy, it is insufficient and the Party Headquarters does not agree. As for the trial implementation in several districts, that is even more inappropriate. Because the amount of funding is ultimately limited, the Municipal Government should certainly not skimp on the overall funding. In short, the Municipal Government should resolve to implement autonomy as soon as possible, and the Party Headquarters, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, should supervise at any time, to complete political division as soon as possible, and fulfill the expectations of the citizens. It is said that they will visit Speaker Shi of the Municipal Council in the next few days.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Li Yushan's Defense in the Case of Yin Geru's Lawsuit <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Declares that Yin has Lost Shareholder Status</p>
<p>Li Yushan, General Manager of the Shanghai Office of the E' Province Shashi Textile Company in Sanhe Lane, Jiangxi Road, recently had a dispute with his shareholder, Yin Geru, and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. After one summons, the case is about to open, and Li has appointed lawyers Xi Yafu and Liu Guang to file a defense. The reasons are roughly as follows: In response to the accusation of breach of trust and embezzlement, a defense and counterclaim are made in accordance with the law. Yin Geru was formerly a shareholder of Shashi Textile Company, holding more than one-hundredth of the total shares. At the end of last year, Yin entrusted the chairman of the factory, Du Shaoru, to come and earnestly request the defendant to find a way to transfer all of his shares. The defendant, out of sympathy for his predicament, readily agreed. At the time, a tea merchant from Hankou, Zhang Yunxuan, was willing to accept the shares at the face value of 10,000 yuan, with interest not included. So, on December 7th of last year, the transfer was scheduled at the company. At that time, Yin came with a person of unknown name who looked like a tea servant. The stock was brought by Du Lunjiu, a representative of the Datong Bank. The company's employee, Hui Meile, handed over 3,066 yuan to Du as compensation for the principal and interest of the mortgage, and issued a check from the Shanghai Bank for 6,334 yuan to Yin for collection. Unexpectedly, Yin had bad intentions, immediately transferred the check to the person he brought, instigated him to go outside, pretended to be watching the transfer stamp printed on the back of the stock, and reached into his pocket, pretending to look for something, suddenly claiming that the seal was forgotten in the store, and that the interest had not been collected so he would not affix the seal. Seeing that he was actually trying to defraud the company of money, the defendant immediately ordered Yu Yingyue to send Yin to the police for investigation. After repeated persuasion by Du and others, Yin realized that he was wrong, affixed the seal, held a grudge, and falsely accused the defendant of assault in the court. Recently, he has falsely claimed to be a shareholder, fabricated words to falsely accuse the defendant, and has been summoned. The defendant is the General Manager and Director of Shashi Textile Company. The Board of Directors is responsible for whether the Board of Directors should be convened and how dividends should be distributed. One person is not allowed to overstep his authority. If the plaintiff has any claims regarding equity, he should make a legal request directly to the company. How can he repeatedly agree with the defendant personally? Moreover, the defendant is performing business for the company. If there is anything inappropriate, he is only subject to the supervision of the supervisor. The plaintiff has no right to directly question him. Now, the plaintiff does not exercise his rights in accordance with the company's articles of association, but directly asks the defendant personally to issue dividends early. Is this not an attempt to extort money? The criminal purpose has not been achieved, and the self-suit is used as a tool for extortion. Regardless of whether the lawsuit is true or not, since the stock has been legally transferred to others, his shareholder status has naturally been lost, and he has no right to enjoy the company's profits. The plaintiff is not the subject of damage to the company, so how can he file a self-suit with the court? Taking a step back in this case, even if there is corruption in the Board of Directors, the victim is the company. The company is a legal person. How can Yin Geru personally represent the company to file a self-suit? etc. The court has now scheduled another hearing for March 17th.</p>

<p>Since the Yongchuan and Dahua ships were raided by pirates who had infiltrated, and the Guangji ship recently repelled several pirate ships on the Huanghuashan sea, Zhejiang's coastal waters have assigned escort police teams to strictly guard the waters for traveling ships. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation sent a secret telegram to notify the shipping companies, saying that according to a secret report, dozens of pirates from Dapeng Bay had sneaked out of their nests and were heading to the Zhejiang Sea to rob merchant ships. Therefore, merchant ships such as Nanhua, Fujian, Wenzhou, and Hutai operating from Shanghai recently are paying more attention to prevention. In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Zhenhai Fortress Command also ordered Staff Officer Lin Qiu to lead armed soldiers on ships to patrol, and the Coast Guard has dispatched two warships to patrol the routes along the Zhejiang coast. Zhejiang fisheries representatives heard of this warning and specially requested Wang Zhiliang, a naval officer in the Jiangzhe Fisheries Area, to set up a temporary pirate prevention office in Sanmen Bay, and dispatched a warship and a coast guard team to protect fishing boats in the Sanmen Bay area. Officer Wang has agreed to add an escort team to prevent pirate robberies.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Man and Woman Commit Suicide by Poison at the Great Shanghai Hotel <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Eight Empty Bottles of Calming Medicine Found</p>
<p>The Identities of the Deceased are Unknown</p>
<p>A case of double suicide by poisoning occurred at the Great Shanghai Hotel in Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, yesterday. According to the investigation, the man claimed to be Cheng Zhiyuan from Guangdong, 30 years old, and booked room 317 at the hotel on the 6th of this month. He often went out to play, accompanied by a well-dressed woman. They slept at the hotel at night, and the staff thought they were husband and wife, so they didn't suspect anything. But yesterday morning at about 11:00 AM, the staff saw that there was no call from the room, which was very strange, so they knocked on the door, but there was no response. They urgently found a way to open the door and enter the room, and saw that the man and woman on the bed were both pale. Eight empty bottles of calming medicine were placed on the bed, and it was known that they had taken poison. They immediately reported to the hotel's accounting office, who reported to the Old Gate Police Station, who sent detectives to the scene. After inspecting the room, there were no other letters or anything else. When questioning the man and woman, neither of them could speak. A car was urgently hired to send Cheng Zhiyuan to Tongren Hospital, but he died in the room due to prolonged exposure to poison. His body was then sent to the Feilen Road morgue to await examination by the court this morning. The woman was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but she also died at 3:00 PM due to severe poisoning. The hospital notified the police station to send the body to the morgue for examination and to investigate the deceased's family members.</p>

<p>Four Corpses Lie Horizontally in the House</p>
<p>Buried Separately, the Situation is Very Miserable</p>
<p>Hu Changsheng, a resident of No. 188 Mugou Bridge, Yangjiazhai, Pudong, is from Danyang and works in a certain association in Shanghai. His wife recently became pregnant with twins, and had been suffering from abdominal pain for three or four days. It wasn't until midnight the day before yesterday that the pain became acute and she went into labor. Hu had hired a midwife in advance to come to the house to deliver the baby. Unexpectedly, Hu's wife gave birth to two baby boys in succession, but the placenta did not come down for a long time. After a while, she gave birth to another baby boy, but the placenta still did not come down. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, the woman went into shock and passed out due to excessive bleeding. At that time, Hu and the midwife were in a panic and watched helplessly as the woman died. Unexpectedly, the first two baby boys also died one after another after dawn. Four large and small corpses lay horizontally in the house, the situation was very miserable. Hu painfully bought coffins and buried them separately. Because of this, residents in the area spread rumors, saying that the three children born were the first child with a white face, the second child with a red face, and the third child with a dark face, all of which were strange appearances, causing the woman to be frightened to death. Some said that the first two children did indeed have one white face and one red face, and the third child had a pockmarked face. However, a mother gave birth to triplets, and their appearances were different. Is this a physiological abnormality? It is recorded here for research.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Shop Assistant Organizes Opium Den in Room <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Opium and Red Pills are Available</p>
<p>In Addition to Opium Pipes, There are Also Handguns</p>
<p>There is a very large opium den in the shop assistant's room on the upper floor of No. 1 Guangdong Road, Da Xiang Foreign Company. The person in charge is Yang Liting from Shaoxing. Although this opium den cannot be called magnificent, the equipment is very exquisite, with everything available: opium, red pills, etc. The smokers are all clerks and servants of foreign companies. Chief Inspector Xu Shucheng of the General Police Station and West Inspector Jefferson found out about this and reported it to the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant. At 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, they led detectives Shen Jinwen and Zhang Xiaolin to secretly go there, arrested Yang, and also arrested smokers Shen Guansheng, Yang Xing, Wang Jinsheng, Gong Gen, Weng Xiantong, Song Youqing, Zhang Jinsheng, Ji Quangen, and Wang Lunzhi. One handgun, seventeen opium pipes, eleven opium lamps, twenty-two taels of opium, three and a half taels of red pills, one bag of opium ash, thirteen jars of red pill ash, and two sets of mahjong tiles were confiscated and taken back to the police station for detention separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi said that Yang Liting violated Article 10 of the Anti-Smoking Law, and the other defendants violated Article 11 of the Law. The police station filed separate charges against them. However, Yang Liting, Shen Guansheng, Yang Xingsheng, and Weng Xiantong requested a postponement because the confiscated handguns were related to them; the others could proceed, the lawyer stated. Qian Hongye, the Criminal Judge, briefly questioned each defendant and ordered Wang Jinsheng, Gong Xinggen, Zong Youqing, and Zhang Jinsheng to be sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. Ji Quangen and Huang Beizhi were found not guilty. Yang Liting and the other four people were rescheduled for further interrogation. The smoking paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>

<p>A Variety Show is Being Prepared for the Closing Day</p>
<p>After the opening of the National Artists' Work Exhibition to Donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army, yesterday was the third day, and the number of visitors was still very crowded. Liu San, a member of the Supervisory Yuan, and Lou Tongsun, a member of the Legislative Yuan, also visited. The Antiquities Department, which is exhibiting at the Ningbo Association, received a handwritten scroll by Wen Tianxiang of the Southern Song Dynasty, donated by Yunnan collector Dou, worth 10,000 yuan. It also displays handwritten scrolls of Yue Wu Mu's "Before and After Expedition Tables," a Tang Dynasty python robe, a speckled wood stool, a portrait of Lu Fangweng, and bean-colored items from the Yongzheng era, goldfish basins from the Qianlong era, etc., all valuable items that are not easily seen elsewhere. All items are marked at very low prices, and many Westerners are making purchases. It is said that the department will display Han tiles, as well as calligraphy and paintings from the Tang and Song dynasties, starting tomorrow. The Modern Calligraphy and Painting Department of the Lang Society has a large number of works, which could not all be displayed, so they plan to change them daily so that visitors can select and purchase as much as possible. The Association sincerely welcomes people from all walks of life to visit and purchase calligraphy and paintings, so that the proceeds can be remitted to the Northeast to help the Volunteer Army. It is reported that the exhibition will close on the 20th of this month. That evening, a grand variety show will be held in the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall of the Lake Society, featuring various theatrical performances. The Board of Directors of the Association has decided to appoint Huang Jingwan and his wife, Bai Jingru, Lu Guo, Qiao Ding, and others to actively prepare and carry out all aspects of the show. Tickets for the variety show are priced at two yuan each. Those who purchase works from the Association and hold a receipt can watch for free.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Public Security Bureau Explains the Burden of Household Registration Plate Fees <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the investigation of household registration changes, the Municipal Public Security Bureau began to compile household registration plates according to households on the 15th of last month, which have now been completed. However, most residents do not understand the responsibility for bearing the household registration plate fees, which often leads to disputes between landlords and tenants. The Public Security Bureau specifically instructed the district offices yesterday to explain: According to the resident Xu Zuoliang, it is requested to explain the responsibility for bearing the household registration plate fee, and to clarify the meaning of "the fee will be paid by the tenant first, and then the tenant will be allowed to claim reimbursement from the owner with the receipt, or deduct it from the rent payment" in the receipt, so as to avoid misunderstandings. According to this, the method of recognizing and paying the household registration plate manufacturing fee has been clearly stipulated in Articles 5 and 8 of the rules, and the meaning is very clear. According to Article 5, the phrase "the fee shall be recognized and paid by the landlord or second landlord" means that the plate fee for the head of the household (i.e., the second landlord) shall be recognized and paid by the main landlord, and the plate fee for the attached household (i.e., the third tenant) shall be recognized and paid by the second landlord. Article 8 states that after the household registration plate is compiled and nailed, it shall be privately owned by each landlord, and the tenant shall not take it away when moving, but the tenant shall be allowed to purchase it if he/she so wishes. This clearly stipulates that the household registration plate is owned by the person who pays for it. Anyone who has the right of ownership has the right to dispose of it at will, and others shall not interfere. However, the second landlord shall not take away the household registration plate paid for by the main landlord, and the third tenant shall not take away the household registration plate paid for by the second landlord, in order to clarify the boundaries. As for the statement "reimburse the fee from the owner" on the receipt, the owner refers to the usual manager. Since the second landlord rents the remaining house to others, he does not need to seek the consent of the main landlord, and the right to rent and control the house is in the hands of the second landlord, who can also be referred to as the owner. The following sentence is "or deduct it from the rent payment." In addition to approving and distributing the previous report, it is necessary to explain in detail and copy the original report, and order the district chief to comply with it. The order shall be recorded and announced to make it known to the public, and all subordinates shall be informed. Be sure to comply with this order.</p>

<p>盛玉麔上訴後判無罪</p>
<p>Formerly, due to operational failures, the Sanxin Yarn Factory was sold to Rong Zongjing. At that time, Sheng Yujun, the factory manager, pleaded with the new owner to allocate 30,000 yuan worth of newly stored scrap iron and other materials to the staff as a reward. Afterwards, factory employees Yu Hesheng, Chen Zhu, and others unexpectedly hired a lawyer to sue Sheng, alleging embezzlement. The First Special Court repeatedly summoned witnesses.  The court initially convicted Sheng of breach of trust and fined him 300 yuan. Sheng, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired lawyer Cha Liu Cheng to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yu Hesheng and others also appealed. During the proceedings, lawyer Cai obtained a response letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce regarding the common practices of Shanghai merchants in allocating rewards to employees, submitting it as evidence. The Second Branch of the High Court concluded its hearing. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Huating presided over Criminal Court One and announced the verdict. The original verdict concerning Sheng Yujun was overturned; Sheng Yujun was acquitted. This labor dispute, lasting nearly a year, has now come to an end.</p>

<p>Cui Chengke, a Chinese detective in the Xinzha Police Department, discovered a gang of armed robbers who specialized in robbing residents of their property in the Public Concession. They then colluded with low-class prostitutes such as Tang Bai and others to sell the stolen goods. Cui began investigating, learning that the gang met daily at the Xinguang Hotel on Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession. The day before, he coordinated with detectives Yang Feizhang and Bao Tan Ma Derong, and took an informant to wait near the Xinguang Hotel. Soon, gang members Yang Jinsheng, Ji Fulin, Zhang Tongfu (aka Monk), Li Fengchun (aka Xiao Erzi), and Zhu Baomei, along with women Lin Hehua and Li Jinxi (both prostitutes), arrived. The detectives arrested them one by one and attempted to arrest the leader Zhang A'gen at No. 12, Tongkang Lane, Huacheng Road, but were unsuccessful. However, they seized 24 pawn tickets and took them back to the police station. They found that the gang had robbed residents at No. 10, Lane 571, Baker Road, during the recent Lunar New Year, stealing valuable property. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the case was still under investigation and requested a postponement. Judge Wu Yanqi questioned Yang, Ji, and Zhang, all of whom confessed to receiving 20 yuan. The judge ordered them to be detained separately for further questioning.</p>

<p>Shanghai has risen in recent years to become the leader in various industries, attracting investors with a concentrated focus, particularly in real estate. The peak period for real estate was before the September 18th Incident. After that, the industry's landscape changed dramatically.  With the January 28th Incident, Shanghai suffered direct damage, and the real estate industry saw few patrons. After March of last year, the war clouds dissipated, and the real estate market showed signs of activity, but transactions remained lukewarm, with limited deals closing by the year's end, falling far short of previous years.  The following is a detailed account of last year's real estate business conditions, based on investigations by the Xinsheng News Agency.</p>
<p>全盛時代</p>

<p>首都電影檢查委員會、以本埠各電影院、於開演業經核准開映之影片時、仍多未能遵照前令、於尚未開映正片以前、加映［審查准映給照］字様、且對於西片字幕、亦未譯爲中文、故特咨請本市市政府、轉令所屬各電影院、對於上列法令、須一律嚴予遵守、並定於三月一日起、凡西片字幕、須悉譯爲中文、以重國體、而利觀衆、市府准咨後、昨已通令所屬電影院、一體遵照、</p>
<p>The Capital Film Censorship Committee noted that many theaters in Shanghai, when screening films that have already been approved, still failed to comply with previous orders to show the words "Approved for Screening" before the main feature and did not translate Western film subtitles into Chinese. Therefore, they specifically requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct all affiliated theaters to strictly comply with the above regulations. It was decided that, starting March 1st, all Western film subtitles must be translated into Chinese to uphold national dignity and benefit the audience. The Municipal Government approved the request and has already issued an order to all affiliated theaters to comply accordingly.</p>
<p>較之十九年多出一位以－倍以上、是年正月份營業開始、卽較以前各月爲盛成交總額、約計一千五百萬兩、法租界買賣最活躍、而面臨浦江佔地甚廣之三星紗廠、亦卽於是月成交、三月份成交總額達一千六百五十萬兩、已突破以前紀錄、至八月份竟逾一千八百萬兩、可謂地產業之全盛時代矣、</p>
<p>more than double that of 1919. Business in January of that year started strong compared to previous months, with the total transaction volume estimated at 15 million taels. Sales were most active in the French Concession, and the large Samsung Yarn Factory, facing the Huangpu River, was also sold in that month. In March, the total transaction volume reached 16.5 million taels, breaking previous records. By August, it exceeded 18 million taels, marking the golden age of the real estate industry.</p>
<p>驟然衰落</p>
<h3 id="e141">Sudden Decline <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>當二十年九月開始甫及半月、成交總額、已達八百二十餘萬兩、來勢正大有可觀、旋忽驟然衰落、其原因除九一八瀋變外、不外㈠英國及其他各國放棄金本位、㈡公債之慘跌、㈢金融市面之緊張、此後十·十一·十二·三個月中、總計成交額僅一千萬兩市况、頓易舊觀、</p>
<p>In September of 1920, the transaction volume reached over 8.2 million taels in the first half of the month, showing great promise. However, it suddenly declined sharply. Besides the September 18th Incident, the reasons were primarily: (1) the abandonment of the gold standard by Britain and other countries; (2) the sharp drop in public bonds; and (3) the tightening of the financial market. Subsequently, in October, November, and December, the total transaction volume was only 10 million taels, and the market situation changed dramatically.</p>
<p>去年情形</p>
<h3 id="e142">Last Year's Situation <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>去年當一二八戰事發生之後、百業停頓、地產一業、亦遂中輟、直至三月間戰雲漸消、市塲始見活動、惟交易甚寡、若接若離、與年俱終、統計每月成交總額僅百萬至三百萬兩之數、其最著者、如三月間有浦東廠地一百零四畝、價銀七十五萬兩、五月間九江路江西路轉角信康大樓樓銀一百五十萬兩、六月間膠州路空地五十二畝、每畝二萬六千餘兩、虹橋路祥茂别業、連地五十九畝售銀二十萬兩、七月間黄浦灘路六號基地二畝半、連同舊屋統售銀七十五萬餘兩、霞飛路亞爾培路轉角地十二畝、連建築物共售一百二十萬兩、十一月份愚　路基地二十七畝　、連建築物洋房二十八宅、統售銀五十五萬兩、福煦路西首空地九畝半售銀四十萬兩</p>
<p>Last year, after the January 28th Incident, all industries came to a standstill, and the real estate industry also came to a halt.  Only in March, when the war clouds gradually dissipated, did the market begin to show activity, but transactions were very limited, and the situation remained lukewarm until the end of the year.  The total monthly transaction volume was only between one million and three million taels.  Notable transactions included: 104 mu of factory land in Pudong for 750,000 taels in March; the Xinkang Building at the corner of Jiujiang Road and Jiangxi Road for 1.5 million taels in May; 52 mu of vacant land on Jiaozhou Road for over 26,000 taels per mu in June; Xiangmao Villa on Hongqiao Road, including 59 mu of land, for 200,000 taels; 2.5 mu of land with old buildings at No. 6 Huangpu Bund Road for over 750,000 taels in July; and 12 mu of land with buildings at the corner of Xiafei Road and Yaerbei Road for 1.2 million taels. In November, 27 mu of land on Yuyuan Road, including 28 buildings and Western-style houses, were sold for 550,000 taels, and 9.5 mu of vacant land on the west end of Fuxu Road were sold for 400,000 taels.</p>
<p>今後趨勢</p>
<h3 id="e143">Future Trends <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>去年地產業成交總額、雖見低落、而價格并不因而貶减、當滬西赿界築路問題初傳解决之說、時大西路一带地價暴漲、惟爲時甚暫、近是案遷延未决、購衆對於該區之興趣已大減、然鐵路以東海格路以西之法華區、尤以橋敦路與安和寺路一带之地產頗受人注意、大約因銜接霞飛路與橋敦路之法華港開始交通所致、又滬杭公路自行駛車輛以來、各方面投機分子、頗欲沿路收買招價居奇、惟聞所謀多不順利、</p>
<p>Although the total transaction volume in the real estate industry declined last year, prices did not decrease as a result. When news of a resolution to the issue of road construction beyond the Shanghai West boundary first spread, land prices in the Daxilu area soared, but only briefly.  As the case has been delayed without resolution, the public's interest in that area has greatly diminished. However, the Fahua area west of Donghai Road along the railway, especially the real estate along Qiaodun Road and Anhe Temple Road, has attracted considerable attention, likely due to the opening of the Fahua Port connecting Xiafei Road and Qiaodun Road.  Since the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway began operating vehicles, various speculators have attempted to buy land along the route and charge exorbitant prices, but it is reported that their plans have largely been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Lin Ayou, 34 years old from Ningbo, worked as a sailor on a gasoline tanker. He lived with his wife, Zhang, 24 years old, in a loft on the second floor of No. 97, Jiande Lane, Oujia Road. The couple's relationship had deteriorated recently. Lin had not reported for duty on the tanker since the 2nd of this month, indulging in laziness and staying home idle, asking a friend to cover for him. When his wife found out, they quarreled and argued. At around 9 p.m. on the 9th, Lin Ayou suddenly rushed into the bedroom with a sharp knife, shouting that he would kill his wife. She fled in terror to the staircase, crying for help, but had already been stabbed in the waist and abdomen. Enduring the pain, she ran to the living room, where cohabitant Wang Zhang and landlord Liu Changyou tried to stop Lin. Lin raged that anyone who reported him to the police would be killed. Fearing his violence, the crowd dared not speak out and could only try to mediate. As Lin's anger gradually subsided, Zhang seized the opportunity to go out and seek treatment at Tongren Hospital. Afterwards, cohabitant Cao Genfa, after learning about the incident and realizing that it would inevitably lead to a major catastrophe, secretly informed the head of the Jiaxing Road Police Department the day before. The police dispatched Chinese detective Ban Minglin to arrest Lin Ayou, and brought him and the knife to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the events and stated that the police were prosecuting Lin for attempted murder under Article 284, Section 3 of the Criminal Code. The knife was presented as evidence. Victim Lin Zhang testified about the incident, and witnesses Liu Changyou, Cao Genfa, and Wang Zhang testified in succession that the couple often quarreled because the defendant did not go to work on the ship. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive, and he begged for forgiveness. After the judge reviewed the evidence, he assigned a lawyer to defend the defendant, and ordered Lin to remain in custody for sentencing at a later date.</p>

<p>答：來信讀悉：在未答復之先，得有一個聲明：就是前次發表足下來信與記者的答語的那個標題，是常川駐館的編輯先生標出的，答復足下來信的我，並不能負這個責任：但是足下不要誤會，記者是在規避，也並不要誤會，我不贊成這個標題。實則這個標題［中國的病在那裏）非常正確，所謂一語破的。大凡我們對於國家或社會的某一現象或某種政治發生問題，一定是這個國家或社會發生毛病，如足下所謂［就是中了［凡事做起來再看］的毛病］，所謂［動不動殺一個人連狗者不如！］所謂［我國却沒有他的技能弄得上不在天，下不在田，］所謂［獨惜人材缺乏］，所謂［求救於國聯，國聯又不援助了！至死還不覺悟前此之非，］至勞足下喟然而歎道：［真無救藥！］這不是足下在歷述足下診斷中國病源的診斷書麽？自然足下這種診斷，是［驢脣不對馬嘴，］然而在足下看來，這確實說明了［中國的病在那裏］的診斷，誰以否認呢？足下還來向我們要說明，那不是足下自己已經承認自己的說話錯誤，便是足下對於自己的說話還沒弄清楚，二者必居一於此。自然，我們有我們對於［中國的病在那裏］的根本見解，我們在辨論之中便會表露出來的，一來是足下的思想要經過好多次的洗刷，才能討論到這一問題，二來是在討論的過程中，會漸漸迫近這個問題，足下自己也會感覺這個問題的十分重要。所以我們還是從足下這次來書中抽出第一條所說的［國家］與［政府］的問題來討論，因爲這兩個問題是我們在上次答復的結語中提出來的：並且這兩個問題一解决，其他各種問題，皆可迎刃而解。我先要唐突一句：足下對於國家之爲何物？政府爲何物？還是和前次來信時一様，你若不信，我們試來研究研究看：㈠你的國家定義是：［以一個民族或幾個民族的共同社會，衣食在於固定的領土之上，不受外力所統治，以赴共同的目的：而其間有一種有組織之政府。以其權能保護全體羣衆，而使之服從。］這個定義方呌［妙］咧！［以一個民族或幾個民族的共同社會］這話怎講？怎様呌做［共同社會？］一個民族的共同社會或幾個民族的共同社會又有什麽分别？台灣從前是中國國家的一體，即組成中國的幾個民族之一，那時中台是一個共同社會：後來割給了日本，便成了日本帝國之一部，即組成現在的日本帝國的幾個民族之一，所以這時的日本與臺灣［高麗也是一様］又是一個共同社會，究竟他們所［共］者何事？所［同］者又何事？這是一。［不受外力所統治，以赴共同的目的］這話又怎講：譬如，日本與高麗在現在有什麽［共同目的可言！誰都知道日本與高麗是同床異夢，生死對頭，然而有誰能在大庭廣衆之中或在事實去否認臺灣，高麗是現在日本帝國之一體？然而他們所［共］者何事？所［同］者又何事？又如英國的愛爾蘭與蘇格蘭是組成英帝國本部的主幹，與英倫並稱三島，在表面上看來，他們是一個共同社會，實則他們的社會一點也不共同，他們的衝突非常利害，尤其是愛爾蘭，我們只要稍稍注意英國的歷史與近數十年的愛爾蘭獨立運動的史實，就曉得英帝國的三島社會就是世界民族與帝國主義的矛盾的典型，請問：他們的［共］在那裏？［同］又在那裏？不但在幾個民族組成的國家沒有足下所謂［共同社會］與所謂［共同目的，］假定一個民族所組成的一個國家如日耳曼民族的德國，他也沒如足下所說的［共同社會］。說到這裏，我們迫不得已又要請敎足下：究竟你所說的共同共同社會是什麽一種東西？怎様地［共］法又怎様地［同］法？我曉得足下一定會答道：休戚與共之謂共，利害相同之謂同，此之謂共同社會是不是呢？我曉得</p>

<p>Gold Price Plunges to 792 Taels</p>
<p>Hoover Has the Motivation to Increase the Price of Silver Coins</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, the near and far-term rates in London remained unchanged, the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.75, the American-British exchange rate and the New York silver price, the forward silver price, and private telegrams from banks indicated that the entire American cotton industry was closed. Therefore, the gold market opened relatively flat at 801 taels and 2 qian, and the exchange market opened flat as well, once rising to 801 taels and 5 qian. Afterwards, the internal market of banks became looser, and HSBC's listed British rate remained unchanged, while the American rate increased by 0.125. The gold price fell further, breaking through the 800 tael mark significantly. Although there were many attempts to rebound, the trend remained weak, and finally, due to a foreign dispatch stating that if Japan were to withdraw from the League of Nations, the situation would definitely worsen, a gloomy atmosphere prevailed, and the price fell to 793 taels near closing. In the afternoon, the price was 3.2 qian. Unfavorable news for the gold market arrived again, stating that President Hoover had the motivation to raise the price of silver coins, and the opening price immediately fell to 791 taels, with the exchange market loosening accordingly. Selling pressure in the market was extremely strong, first breaking the 90 tael mark and falling to 788 taels and 8 qian. There was a slight rebound of about 3 taels, to 792 taels and 2 qian, but the downward trend continued. Hengxing, on behalf of the Central Bank, opened 420 accounts and temporarily held the gold price at around 1 tael, but sellers continued to emerge. When Hengxing reached its limit and withdrew, the 90 tael mark was broken again, and the price fell to 788 taels and 5 qian. Afterwards, the market gradually stabilized. A telegram from Bombay indicated a drop of 4 annas, and the price returned to above 90 taels, before rising again to 792 taels and 5 qian. With unstable sentiment, the price finally fell back by 1 tael, closing at 790 taels and 6 qian. It was observed that the gold market experienced frequent declines throughout the day, breaking through the 800 tael and 90 tael marks successively, with the downward momentum being stronger than the consecutive days of gains last week. The swap spread (February to March) was slightly lower, at 3.5 taels and 4 taels, with limited trading volume. The swap spread for this period was generally similar (compared to February swapping for March). The actual situation can be roughly understood today, as the gold industry typically requires advance preparation one day prior. The market situation is now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Morning Market Breaks Through 800 Taels</p>
<p>The morning opening was 801 taels and 2 qian, a slight increase of 4 qian compared to the previous close. The exchange market opened extremely flat, with recent bids for British exchange at 1 shilling and 7 pence 6875, and American exchange at 28.125 yuan. Due to the closure of the silver market, sentiment was somewhat stabilized. The opening price of goods was 801 taels and 3 qian, rising to 1 tael and a half, but trading was not vigorous, initially hovering around 1 tael. Richang Shengda came to sell bars, causing the price to drop to within 1 tael, at 0.005 qian. American dollars for April were available at 28.25 yuan. Fuyu Zhifeng Yongchu offered at 800 taels. Holland offered American dollars for March at 1.875, and Citibank also sold this month's at 1.25, breaking the 800 tael mark. Hengyu sold to around 799 taels, briefly stabilizing. Upon learning that the listed American exchange rate increased by 0.125, the price fluctuated to within 9 taels. Shortly after, HSBC's listed rates were announced, with the shilling unchanged and the American exchange rate increasing by 0.125. China Bank offered American dollars for April at 3.75, and goods suddenly emerged, quickly reaching 8 taels and 1 qian. Afterwards, the market situation showed a rebound, hovering for a long time, once reaching 9 taels and 2 qian. Shengda continued to sell small amounts, and with American dollars for March at 2.5 being difficult to sell, the price was 8 taels and a half. Yuanheng also sold at 7 taels and 9 qian, rebounding by a few qian to 8 taels and 7 qian. However, the exchange market was extremely loose, Citibank again sold American dollars for March at 3.125, and Fuyu sold to within 8 taels. Ruixing sold at 7 taels and a half, and Zhifeng Yong also came to sell. Mitsui sold American dollars for April at 4.375, breaking to within 7 taels. Yongfeng sold to 6 taels and a half, before starting to fluctuate. Retail investors made slight purchases, but with Zhifeng Yong limiting sales at 7 taels and 1 qian, and Qian Changxiang limiting sales at 7 taels, the upward momentum temporarily decreased, only able to hover within 7 taels. When Yuanchun Hengyu made slight purchases, the price surged to above 7 taels. It was heard that HSBC bought American dollars for April at 4.375, at 7 taels and 8 qian. Zhaofeng Chang and Ruixing continued to sell, retreating to around 7 taels. Hengxing entered the market to purchase, raising the price to 7 taels and 6 qian, but Fuyu and others offered, lowering the price to 7 taels. Zhenggin offered shillings for April at 0.875, and Daxing Yong aggressively sold to within 6 taels. American dollars for May at 5.625 were met with no inquiries. Yuan Maoyong Daxing Yong continued to sell at around 5 taels. At this point, the exchange market became fierce, and banks showed no intention to purchase. Sentiment turned cautious, Hengyu Fuyu sold to 4 taels, and Zhifeng Yong further unloaded, causing the price to fall to 793 taels. The exchange market was steadily strengthening, with shillings for this month at 0.8125 and American dollars at 3.75 yet to see any transactions. The noon closing was slightly higher by 2 qian, at 793 taels and 2 qian. Goods were lower, closing at a discount of 2 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Reaches a Low of 788 Taels and a Half</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was lower by 2 taels and 2 qian compared to the noon close, at 791 taels. The news that President Hoover had plans to increase the price of silver coins spread through the market, and selling sentiment permeated. The opening price of goods was 791 taels and 3 qian, and arbitrageurs entered the market, causing the price to reach 1 tael and a half. Hengyu Yuan Maoyong and others came to sell, causing a sharp drop of over 2 taels to 90 taels. Yuan Maoyong Yuankangxiang and others continued to offer, breaking the 90 tael mark and falling to 788 taels and 8 qian. Shengda Zhifeng Yong entered the market, and the price was pulled up. McCarley purchased American dollars for June at 8.125, and Fushun came to purchase at 90 taels. Zhaofeng Chang and Yifeng Yong purchased to around 1 tael, Ruixing offered slightly, still at 0.05 qian. Bingxing Qian Changxiang purchased to above 1 tael, Shanghai purchased American dollars for April at 5.625, and Fuchang Zhaofeng purchased again, causing the price to rise to 792 taels and 2 qian.

The market immediately strengthened after opening, but HSBC's listed British rate did not move, while the American exchange rate increased by 0.125, causing further loosening. Afterwards, foreign dispatches reported that if Japan were to withdraw from the League of Nations, various violent measures would occur, causing great fear, and the gold price also fell. Near the noon closing, banks' appetite to buy seemed sluggish, and the market further strengthened. In the afternoon, unfavorable news arrived again, with Hoover planning to increase the price of silver coins, leading to a more tragic scene. The market situation became increasingly loose, finally stabilizing slightly.

<p>Foreign Cents Market is Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for foreign cents, silver discounts, and various subsidiary coins was identical in both the morning and afternoon markets, as if there were no afternoon market prices, indicating the recent sluggish trading and desolate market atmosphere, which is the quietest phenomenon of the whole year. The foreign cent price was 7 qian, 1 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao and a half, the same as the previous day's morning market. The turnover of exchange drafts in the morning market was only 345,000, and in the afternoon market was 305,000. The turnover in the banknote market was 30,000 in the morning and 15,000 in the afternoon, and the off-market turnover was 51,000 in the morning and 20,000 in the afternoon. The turnover of checks was 60,000 in the morning and 40,000 in the afternoon. Various banks bought and sold foreign coins, with no activity from large banks, and only minor transactions from Chinese commercial banks. It is estimated that the interbank turnover in the morning market was 350,000, and in the afternoon market was 300,000. The foreign account transactions of various banks were only over 1.7 million, with banknote transactions ranging from 1.6 to 1.7 million.

<p>Distorted Situation of Securities and Public Bonds Rebounding</p>
<p>Each Price Falls by 1 to 2 Yuan</p>
<p>The Trading is Also Very Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly rebounded, causing a surge of turbulence. The decline was particularly severe. The reporter had long anticipated that the situation in this foreign affairs issue had reached a point of no return, and there would be many waves. As yesterday morning's opening showed stable sentiment, the market had demand. In addition to retail investors, financial institutions also made purchases. Although Nos. 45 and 50 were sold, the appetite for Nos. 16 and 17 remained strong, and the market price still rose by a few jiao. Military Reorganization Bonds alone rose by 0.7 jiao. However, the Unified Salt Tax Bonds appeared relatively weak. Nos. 38 and 45 continued to be sold during trading, leading to a downward trend. Various bonds deteriorated, with the listed types declining the most. The market price dropped by 0.2-0.3 yuan to 1 yuan. There were slight rumors circulating in the market. In the afternoon, due to a Reuters dispatch stating that after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the Japanese army would definitely blockade various Chinese coastal and river ports, causing widespread panic. The opening price plummeted by over 1 to 2 yuan. Among them, No. 11 and excessive retail sales caused the largest decline. Although Nos. 16 and 17 made purchases at the same time, the imbalance in buying and selling pressure resulted in suppression. The closing trading was relatively clear, with No. 11 still in demand. The market price showed a distorted situation, with both increases and decreases. For example, 19 Customs and 19 Relief Bonds rose by 0.2-0.3 yuan to 0.5-0.6 yuan, while other types remained weak. As a result, the market price fell by 0.8 to 1.8 yuan, with the Unified Salt Tax Bonds experiencing the largest decline, falling by 1.4 to 1.8 yuan. The rest also fell by over 1 yuan, with only the 18 Customs Bonds declining by a small amount of 0.25 yuan. If the diplomatic news is not based on rumors, the future of the bond market is expected to experience further turbulence. The trading volume also significantly increased, totaling 11,175,100 yuan, including 1,000 yuan for spot trading. The Unified Salt Tax Bonds futures alone accounted for 4,770,000 yuan, while the remaining various types totaled 6,980,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Rampant Rumors in the Cotton Yarn Market Cause a Sharp Decline</p>
<p>This Month's Futures Break Below 40 Tael Mark</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market experienced a severe decline due to rampant rumors stating that a certain country might withdraw from the League of Nations and blockade China's coastal ports. This caused a surge in panic and selling pressure, especially among small-scale short sellers. Coupled with sluggish demand in this city, the market felt increasingly unstable with such adverse news. This month's futures broke below the 40 tael mark.</p>
<p>Rongxing Liquidates Large Number of Long Positions</p>
<p>The morning market opened with a flat trend due to the closure of the American cotton market. The market for spot yarn remained sluggish, and the market atmosphere did not change. In the afternoon, rampant rumors caused widespread panic. Prices for each month fell sharply, ranging from 1.35 to 1.79 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 39,300 bales. Specifically, Suilong sold 1,950 bales, Rongxing sold 850 bales, Renfeng sold 1,150 bales, Taichang sold 900 bales, Xinhua sold 1,700 bales, and Tonghe sold 1,450 bales.

<p>Sluggish Spot Yarn Consumption</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn remained limited. It was observed that various groups purchased a total of 476 bales for the day. Prices fell by approximately 0.5 qian, with the exception of 42-count yarn, which fell by 1.2 taels. The purchasing amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 96 Guangdong 25 Counterparts 45</p>
<p>Yunnan 140 Xiamen 35 Shantou 35 Zhenjiang 10 Luzhou 90</p>
<p>Cotton Market Increasingly Softens</p>
<p>Long Positions Still Maintain Strength, Decline Not As Severe As Cotton Yarn Market</p>
<p>The cotton market strengthened in the morning but declined in the afternoon, and the market trend felt increasingly soft. It was also affected by the cotton yarn market, but some participants absorbed the long-term positions without change. Most felt that if a certain country were to blockade the harbor, foreign cotton could not be transported to China, and the domestic production of raw cotton would be insufficient, requiring reliance on foreign cotton. As a result, the long positions still maintained strength, and the decline in the cotton market was not as severe as in the cotton yarn market.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao (Cotton) Market Softens in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The morning market for Zheng Biao opened with a flat trend due to the closure of the American cotton market in observance of Lincoln's Birthday. Prices for each month did not change. In the afternoon, influenced by the bearish trend, prices for each month fell by 0.2-0.3 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 59,800 dan.

<p>May 32.45 -0.25 72,002</p>
<p>February 31.45 -0.20 81,800</p>

<p>April 32.25 -0.25 94,700</p>
<p>Total 428,100</p>
<p>Factory Demand Remains Average</p>
<p>The demand for spot cotton remained average. The sources included 1,700 bales of Yaohua cotton and 32.00 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<p>Hengfeng Factory purchased 1,300 bales of spot cotton. The price for Beishi cotton sent to factories was 31.00.</p>
<p>Also, 1.1 bales. And also, 32.50 bales of Shaanxi cotton. Hongzhang Factory purchased 200 pieces. Again, 32.35.</p>
<p>Also, 200 pieces.</p>
<p>Cottonseed Sales Sluggish, Price Reduced by 0.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, although the arrival of cottonseed has not been high, the factory's purchasing appetite is also sluggish. This is because the current situation is related to the unsettled sales of cake and the declining market price of clear oil due to the soy oil market. In light of the current situation, there is little room for optimism. It has now been decided by the council to reduce the price of all cottonseed by 0.1 yuan starting yesterday.</p>
<p>English Cotton Declines, American Cotton Market Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was closed for Lincoln's Birthday. English cotton futures fell by 1 point, and spot cotton fell by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 3 points.

<p>Grain and River Rice Prices Vary Slightly</p>
<p>Xiang Rice Has Arrived in Excess of 20,000 Bags</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, there were over 30 sources, and there was some appetite from urban and rural stores. The bag appetite was sluggish, due to the tragic fall in prices in the originating area. It was heard that the price in Tianjin was only 10 yuan and 0.04 jiao, leading to merchants only adding small amounts of one to two hundred shi. The market situation was stable, and the shapes of Sutong and Nangang rice were improving, with prices remaining steady. Qingjiao thin rice saw bag appetite be sluggish, and Zhongguan goods experienced a slight price reduction of 1-2 jiao. Du Yangjian and Bian Yinyuan experienced no gain or loss, and Chang Gang began trading, still being measured according to the five-dou market hu, it was said.</p>
<p>Shanghai North: There were over 40 rice sources, with high-quality white japonica rice being flat and medium-quality and lower-quality rice declining. The prices of high-quality rice were weakening, and the prices of medium-quality and lower-quality rice were stable. There were slight arrivals of early Pu japonica rice, and the scattering market continued to decline. Pu rice prices were stable, and early rice prices experienced slight increases. Yangjian arrivals continued without interruption, and the sales were quite good, with prices being stable at high levels. Medium-quality and lower-quality rice experienced a slight increase, and Du Bu Jian experienced mixed sales. Customer grain was even, and Yinyuan arrivals were low, with sluggish sales. Bai Yuan arrivals were gradually decreasing, and trading was considered acceptable, with hu prices experiencing a slight increase.</p>
<p>Xiang Customer Grain: There were widespread rumors of large arrivals in recent days, causing the market to feel unstable. After the market opened yesterday morning, the cargo owners were actively promoting new arrivals. According to investigations, Hoxin had imported Jiangjing, Poyang, Wuxue, Jihe, Xinningxing, and Lao Xiangtai in six rounds, totaling approximately 25,000 bags of Xiang customer rice. Lao Xiangtai had the most ship space, approximately 7,000 bags. Most of the arrivals were Xiang rice, followed by Gan and Wu rice. Since the samples were not fully available, the exact amount was unknown. Customer rice buyers felt increasingly indifferent, and local merchants were hesitant to inquire, causing the market to be sluggish. In the morning, local merchants only dealt with 56 bags of Jiangxi machine rice at a price of 8 yuan and 0.055 jiao. In the afternoon, the cargo owners reduced the price by 0.1 jiao, and local merchants finally traded 1,000 bags at a price of 8 yuan and 0.08-0.055 jiao. The outlook for the market continued to be bearish.</p>
<p>Raging Storm of Falling Standard Wheat and Flour Prices</p>
<p>Deteriorating Situation ··· Foreign Wheat Dumping ··· Long Positions Freely Unloading</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of instability in the morning. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat recovered slightly, the actual sales remained sluggish. Customer trading experienced returns due to the poor environment and the deteriorating situation in the North. As a result, the closing prices for each month fell by slightly more than 0.1 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, the dangerous decline that had not been seen in months resurfaced. The situation was tragic, and the volume of trading was unprecedented. Initially, there were rumors of violent Japanese blockades of the coast and rivers, and the seriousness of the Jehol issue. Then, the quoted price of spot foreign wheat saw a new low price, with Australian wheat being quoted at only 3.5 taels (5.5 qian in the morning) and Argentine wheat being quoted at 3.25 taels (2.8 fen in the morning). Then, the gold price also fell sharply. This combination of factors caused widespread instability, and customer long positions unloaded freely, leading to a sharp market decline with no sign of recovery. Given this situation, it is possible that the market may return to last year's lowest price. As a result</p>

<p>Shanghai Times News Agency, local dispatch: Since the occupation of the three northeastern provinces, most undertakings have virtually come to a standstill. However, the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, being a charitable organization, has not ceased its relief efforts in the two provinces. Our reporter specifically asked a responsible member of the association, who stated that if reports of victims in the three provinces are received, they will still try their best to rescue them. However, the procedures are now much more troublesome than before, as it used to be possible to directly send telegrams to Shenyang or other places, but now it must be relayed through Tianjin or Dalian. However, no such incidents have occurred since the fall of the Northeast. As for the residential care facility, it was temporarily moved to the Qiliu Shelter on Xinzha Road after the outbreak of war in Shanghai, but the building is extremely small and quite insufficient. After the end of the Shanghai war, the buildings in Jiangwan were all damaged by Japanese aircraft, and it was impossible to move them immediately. Later, with the best efforts of the association, they were repaired and completed by the end of January. Therefore, the seven hundred or so refugees, large and small, residing in the Qiliu Shelter were moved back to Jiangwan on the first of this month. There have been no changes in Xiamen and other places. It is also reported that the association is in dire financial straits, and the funds for repairing the Jiangwan buildings have not yet been fully paid off.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Two Major Gambling Cases Transferred to the Court <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, due to the rampant proliferation of major gambling dens in the Chinese area, ordered all district departments and teams to strictly investigate and deal with them. If there are large gambling dens within the jurisdiction and the district chiefs do not take action, they will be dismissed and held accountable. As a result, the day before yesterday, detectives discovered a large-scale gambling den at Lane 499, Zhaozhou Road, in the Second District of Ximen. They immediately dispatched additional detectives to surround and arrest the suspects, capturing 54 men and women, including Ma Jingyun, Li Shitao, Wang Keshun, and Chen Ronghua. A large number of gambling paraphernalia, such as mahjong tiles, dominoes, chips, and dice, were confiscated and sent to the team for further investigation by the Judicial Section. In addition, the Caojiadu Sixth District Police Station, in view of the rampant gambling trend in various places, sent detectives to investigate and discovered a large gambling den at No. 1 Yonggen Lane in Caojiadu. Therefore, they secretly dispatched patrol officers, hall officials, and police chiefs to surround and arrest 44 suspects, including Mao Shouliqing, Wang Yeshan, and Lu Yusheng. A large number of gambling paraphernalia, such as dice games, were confiscated. They were immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau and handed over to the Judicial Section for questioning. The above gambling cases were investigated by staff members yesterday morning and will be transferred to the local court for legal action after obtaining confessions.</p>

<p>Should Be Attributed to Detectives' Intimidation with Guns</p>
<p>The Court Must Now Autopsy the Body</p>
<p>Wang Shen, an old woman from Huai'an who lives at No. 7 Qishan Lane, Laobasheng Road, Shanghai West, and runs a wood chip shop, filed a lawsuit with the local court, stating that on January 31st, a detective from the Public Security Bureau, Sun Hanquan, suddenly knocked on the door in the middle of the night and entered the house, claiming that there were opium and red pills in her house. He then used a gun to intimidate and coerce her seventeen-year-old son, Wang Heqing, causing her son to be terrified and his heart to break. He immediately collapsed on the ground, and from then on, he talked nonsense, had chills and fever, and was extremely frightened, leading to his death two days later. Her son's death was actually caused by fright, and she requested justice. The case was heard by Prosecutor Yang An. The woman insisted that her son had died of a frightened heart. The judge found the allegations to be bizarre and unprecedented. However, since the lawsuit had been filed, it should be thoroughly investigated to be convincing. Therefore, he planned to have the coffin transported to the court for examination. Yesterday afternoon, he again dispatched police to accompany the woman and transport the coffin by car to the Forensic Examination Institute of the Ministry of Justice in Zhenru for autopsy to determine the cause of death, so as to make a decision. It is expected that the autopsy will be conducted the day after the coffin arrives in Zhenru.</p>

<p>Yu Guangmao Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison</p>
<p>Yu Guangmao, a Ningbo native residing at No. 19 Dingxiang Lane, Gale Road, French Concession, is 34 years old. Recently, he became unemployed and impoverished, so he had a whimsical idea. In the latter half of last month, he wrote threatening letters three times in the name of Lin Ahe to his neighbor Song Yangfu, a fellow villager at No. 21, demanding a loan of 1,400 yuan. The letter stated, "Recently, someone wanted to kidnap you, but I intervened and prevented it from happening. However, you must compensate them for their losses of 1,400 yuan." After receiving the letter, Song pretended to put up a red paper at the door with the words "(Received Advice)" written on it. He then reported the letter to the French Concession Police Station. Inspectors Jin Jiulin, Detective Zhang Zixian, and Li Tongbao of the Special Agency put counterfeit money into a sack as instructed and placed it at the back door of Yu's house. They guarded the area until 2:00 AM, when Yu went to pick up the sack and was arrested. He was sent to the Second Special District Local Court, where the police station's lawyer filed a public prosecution against him for extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Code. The trial has concluded, as detailed in previous reports. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiong Hui of the First Criminal Court ordered the defendant to be brought to court and sentenced Yu Guangmao to eight months of imprisonment for the crime of attempting to unlawfully obtain property from another person through extortion. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. After the sentencing, the defendant was taken back to the detention center.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Major Gambling Den Cracked Down at No. 2 Fuyu Lane, Nanyang Bridge <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Western Detectives Surrounded the Area</p>
<p>Only Five Tea Servers and Accountants Were Arrested</p>
<p>The harm of gambling on lotteries is greater than floods and fierce beasts. Many men and women who are addicted to lotteries have been ruined and even sacrificed their lives due to gambling debts. Although the Chinese and foreign police authorities have strictly prohibited it, the gambling thugs disregard the law and continue to operate secretly, day and night, with huge winnings and losses. These gangs have many followers and well-informed sources. Moreover, the headquarters (which they call the "Big Factory") is constantly moving, making it difficult to crack down. This time, Bao Tan, the leader of the gambling arrest team of the French Concession Police Station, Inspector Li Yousheng, Detective Tao Sheng, and others, after setting up a plan, learned the location of the factory and led Chinese and French detectives to secretly surround and arrest the suspects yesterday afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Location of the Big Factory: The headquarters of the lottery (i.e., the "Big Factory") is located at No. 2 Yufu Lane, Nanyang Bridge (border between the Chinese and French areas). Gamblers (i.e., those who buy lottery tickets) and ship owners (i.e., those who specialize in collecting gambling money from scattered gamblers in various roads and lanes) must enter through the main gate at No. 8 and reach the gambling den by walking through the back door to No. 3. Outsiders cannot easily reach it. Moreover, there is an electric bell installed at No. 8. When there is a police alert, the lookout will press the electric bell, and the gambling paraphernalia in the gambling den will be hidden, and the gamblers will escape through other numbers. There is also a smoking couch on the upper floor of the gambling den for people to smoke opium and red pills. The internal scale is very large, and there are male and female attendants to serve the gamblers.</p>
<p>Internal Leader: The leader of the Big Factory is Gu Malu (nicknamed Molozi), who is a disciple of the late Zhang Xiansheng, the lottery king of Mengjiangtang, also known as Kuozuiba Xiansheng. After Zhang's death, Gu inherited his master's business and accumulated millions of dollars over the years. He even drives a car and flaunts his wealth in the city. Those who do not know him may think he is a wealthy gentleman or a high-ranking official. The Big Factory is named Angyiji. Every day, his followers are sent to wait for gamblers in front of the Southern Chujiaqiao Cattle Company and lead them to the Big Factory to gamble.</p>
<p>Lottery Ticket Format: The Big Factory must issue lottery tickets every day. Yesterday morning, the lottery was [Ri Shan] [Rong Sheng], at noon it was [Tian Liang] [Mao Lin], and at night it was [Wan Jin] [Yuan Ji]. Every day, one lottery is issued in the morning, and the numbers are drawn at 12:00 noon, 6:00 PM, and 12:00 midnight. After each lottery is drawn, dozens of messengers (i.e., number reporters) ride bicycles to report the numbers to Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Puxi.</p>
<p>Details of the Crackdown: Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, when the Big Factory was settling accounts (i.e., calculating the gambling money received after the morning lottery was drawn), Inspector Li and Detective Tao, along with a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, rode several cars to Fuyu Lane and surrounded the Big Factory from the front and back. They rushed in from No. 8 and searched the gambling den through the back door. By that time, the gamblers had already dispersed, and only five people, including the gambling den's accountant and tea servers, were arrested. The lottery charts, account books, ledgers, abacus, stamps, seals, lottery tickets, and opium pipes and lamps were all confiscated and taken to the police station along with the gamblers for interrogation. At the same time, the Big Factory leader, Gu Malu, and others who were at large are being hunted down to eradicate the atmosphere.</p>

The fire quickly spread through the roof, and the flames soared, destroying many machines and causing heavy losses. The building was also slightly damaged. The fire was extinguished after the fire brigade dispatched vehicles to put out the fire for more than two hours.</p>

It was resolved to complete the elections before the 28th of this month. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
