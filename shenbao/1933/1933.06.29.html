<h3 id="c11">暑假告靑年聖 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>現在又臨到炎熱的暑天了。在最近期間。全國各級學校。都將有一個較長時間的假期。</p>
<p>自然也許有許多人在打算着。「暑假中是去廬山好呢。還是去莫干山好呢。」也許有許多人在欣幸着。「學生該有這麽一個休息的假期。天氣是這麽炎熱。」但我們以爲一般淸寒的靑年。是决没有休息的機會的。而一般有心的靑年們。也决没有避暑的閑暇的。能夠安心休息。能夠安心避暑的。只有那飽食安居而無所用心的小姐與少爺。然而這一班在火山口上跳舞的人。我們認爲根本不能生存於現時代。尤其是不能生存於現時代正處在艱苦進程中的中國。</p>
<p>猶記得在去年暑期中。本報曾舉行一次暑期徵文。題爲「暑期工作計劃與工作報告。」同時曾發表「靑年如何利用暑假」一文。大意謂「國至今日。已臨到生死線上。吾人亦惟有臥薪嘗膽。刻苦求學以培養奮鬥之實力耳。假期内兩月光陰。如坐令虚擲。至爲可惜。」這一次徵文。居然收獲了很好的成績。多數靑年從各處寄來縝密的工作計劃。隨後又奇來實踐的工作報告。這可以確實證明有許多靑年。是不肯辜負這悠長的假期。不肯白費這寳貴的時光。</p>
<p>從去年到今年。國難是絲毫没有减輕。而且日漸深重。事實已經證明世界是日趨於動盪。中國尤其日趨於艱難。處在這狂風暴雨的時代裏。我們每一個中國人。尤其是每一個學生靑年。還能漠然無動於中。苟安旦夕嗎。</p>
<p>我們認民族的意義上。在當前靑年們。應該切實把握住這動盪的時代。應該把握住在這動盪的時代中。靑年們所應做的是什麽。假如說。目前靑年們應該救國救民族。那末究竟怎樣去着手。而救國救民族的眞實意義。又是什麽。這些靑年們應該預加以深切的考盧。而且應該有計劃的切實負起自身的使命。務使這寳貴的時光不至虚擲。</p>
<p>再就個人的立塲說。顧亭林先生說得好。「人之爲學。不日進則日退。」這不能間斷兩個月悠久的時光。所以爲了個人的學問上的造就。靑年們也得利用其暑假。毋使大好的時光。擲於虚牝。</p>
<p>中國的一線生機。全繫於今日成千成萬的靑年諸君身上。我們謹以無限的熱忱。希望今日的靑年。都能刻苦自勵。努力於自已的使命。而勿把自已作成一個小姐少爺。成爲這狂風暴雨的時代裏一個無用的廢物。</p>

<p>靑島通訊、東北海軍司令兼靑島巿長沈鴻烈、於本月二十四日下午四時、在大港碼頭爲其部屬馮志冲謀刺未遂一節、已誌前報、記者因事關重要、特向各方刺探、並親訪沈氏、面詢一切茲將所得分紀於次、</p>
<p>▲謀刺原因此事發生之原因有二、㈠因沈氏自兼巿篆後、其所直接官轄之東北海軍中下級幹部、僉以爲升官發財之機會已至、於是對靑島巿公安局長·保安隊大隊長·及巿府所屬各機關重要職員等、莫不各思攫得一席、無奈沈氏對於巿府所屬各機關要員、非有特别情形者、絶未更動一人、其部屬因所欲未遂、對沈氏未免觖望、此爲結怨部屬之第一原因、㈡沈氏近來對禁烟一事、極爲認眞、數月前沈曾訓令巿府及海軍雙方職員、凡染有此項嗜好者、一律限期戒除、逾期後倘不戒除、一經查出、即予以撤職、雖至親亦不輕貸、海軍方面下級幹部沾染此等惡習者甚夥、雖經沈氏三令五申、遵限戒絶者固不少、而玩忽功令者、亦大有其人、因此爲沈氏查出、予以革職處分者數人、而未經查出者、亦均惴惴不自安、此爲結怨部下之第二原因、此外東北海軍、原先積欠軍餉至四閱月之多、沈兼巿長後、其部屬均希望沈氏由靑島地方收入項下、將</p>
<p>欠餉發清、奈沈就市長職後、並不爲海軍</p>
<p>開闢財源、對昔日欠餉、未經提及、此亦爲結怨部屬原因之一、</p>
<p>▲行刺情形沈氏旣結怨部下、海軍中下級幹部、遂有倒沈之醞釀、（但内部並非一致、亦有主張擁沈者、）鎭海艦砲正馮志冲、即爲倒沈之一、當本月二十四日下午四時、沈由大港活碼頭乘海王號小火輪赴鎭海艦訓話之際、同船前往者、除沈之隨從史復生外、（沈向例每出並無扈從、僅帶聽差一人、）馮亦在輪中、詎船離活碼頭後、駛行未遠、馮由身邊掏出手槍、向沈射擊、連放三槍、均未命中、幸沈之隨從史復生在旁、急趨前將馮力推、馮即落水、當時沈鎭定如常、神色自若、仍由史護送至鎭海艦後、對官兵訓話、史即乘小輪返回、時馮已爲公安三分局大港分所用杉板撈起、史說明馮行刺情形、又由馮身上搜出勃郎寗手槍、子彈八十九粒、以先所執之手槍已墮落海中、當由該分所將馮看管、晚間由海軍司令部提訊後、即於翌晨執行槍决、</p>
<p>▲聨合倒沈此事發生以後、在沈氏原不欲多事追究、故僅將馮槍决完事、詎料馮之同黨等、因沈將馮遽置重典、遂聨合其他下級幹部、公關爲倒沈運動、其中擁沈一派、因勢孤力弱、爲衆挾制、未敢反抗、該黨並假揑海軍全體名義、要求沈氏下野、海軍司令部重要職員及駐靑各艦長等、連日均齋集司令部内會商解决辦法正在商討之中、駐泊後海圻·海琛·肇和·三艦竟不聽長官命令（三艦艦長均未在艦）於二十六日自由行動、開</p>
<p>出港外、（有謂南下者、有謂赴威海者、未）知孰是、）而此事遂愈弄愈僵、無法收拾矣、惟聞沈氏個人、自遭此打擊後、態度異常消極、亟願借此退步、以資休養、聞昨已分電中央軍委及行政院、請辭去海軍司令曁靑島巿巿長兼職、至能否邀准、尙未可知、</p>
<p>▲沈氏談話據沈對記者談、余自問生平待人處世、俯仰無愧、不幸竟發生此變、殊出我意料之外、但余絶不因此灰心、在中央未准辭職以前、在職一日、即盡一日職務、决不放棄職守云云、（六月二十七日）</p>

<p>該路所經區域、係屬江蘇浙江兩省轄境、故由兩省建設廳分任興築、自民國二十一年六月間籌劃進行、至今年已越六月、全路始告藏事、首尾適歷一年、茲就蘇浙兩段分述其建築經過如次、㈠江蘇叚、此叚起自蘇州盤門向東之海關、迄於蘇浙邊界之王江涇鎭、計長五二·一公里、北段路基、自民國十九年卽開始興築、蘇州至吳江一段、由吳縣建設局徵工築成、惟寛度僅五公尺、吳江至八㘮二段、亦經吳江縣建設局一度徵工建築、然路基僅具雛形、高度所差尙多、橋涵工程、亦曾由兩縣建設局擔任修築、計蘇吳段内完成鋼筋混凝土橋十座、木質橋梁十座、涵洞五道、水管八十餘道、其自八㘮以南之路綫、所經河流紛錯、地勢低窪、工程頗屬浩大、各縣限於財力、以故久未興工、及至民國二十一年五月間、本會認該路關係兩省交通至爲重要、亟應迅速完成、乃將該路列爲三省聨絡公路之一、並屬國聨顧問敖京基協同蘇省建設廳覆勘平湖至王江涇一段之路線、該段原定路綫、係由八㘮過運河、沿東岸至平望鎭、復過河直趨王江涇、旣須建築大橋兩座、而所經村鎭、又較偏僻、敖顧問乃建議改綫、由八㘮沿運河西岸行、經平望鎭之西、過盛澤鎭而至可期發達、蘇省建設廳遂依其議、飭縣重行測量、路綫旣定、乃於同年八月間組設蘇王段工程處於平望、九月後、各項工程次第開工、及至二十一年年底、全路路基土方及橋樑工程、已完成十之七八、路面材料、亦運到甚多、惟以時届冬季雨雪連綿、故二十二年一二兩月、工程進行較緩、三月以後、復積極進行、於是橋樑涵洞堤岸護牆及路面工程、陸續告竣、㈡浙江段、此段起自嘉興城外運河橋、迄於蘇0浙邊界之王江涇、計長一四七公里、自民國二十一年五月間、經本會將該段劃入三省聨絡公路後、卽由浙江省公路局籌劃進行、組設嘉王段工程處於嘉興、全段同時動工、因里程旣短、所經又屬平原、施工頗易故工程進展甚速、全段路基土方工程、於二十一年十月間卽告完成、橋樑涵洞水管等工程、亦於同年十一月完工、惟嘉興附近之運河橋、橋工較鉅、於本年四月間、始告竣工、路面工程、則於本年三月初補竣、</p>

<p>蘇嘉公路全路工程、係依照蘇浙兩省公路工程標準、並參照本會規定公路工程標準辦理、因全路路綫所經、盡屬平原、故坡度曲綫、均頗良好、僅隣近橋頭之坡度稍大、亦不過百分之三、曲綫半徑、則均在七十公尺以上、橋樑載重量、在蘇嘉段爲十二噸、浙段者稍次之、茲分段述其工程槪况如次、（一）江蘇段、路基寛度七·五公尺、土方工程、除由縣政府已做成約十萬公方外、新做土方約四十八萬餘公方、中舗碎磚土面寛度二公尺、橋頭及鄰近湖蕩處、酌量加寛、以便交車、橋涵工程、除由縣建設局已修成者外、新建木質橋樑共四十三座、其中以蘇州附近之　帶橋、工程爲最鉅、該橋原擬利用舊有石拱橋、嗣經蘇建廳派員詳細考察、該橋寛度、旣　不敷、且橋基橋拱、均漸坍圯、不利行車、卽使可以加寛加固、結果恐仍難適用、遂决定在舊橋之西約六十公尺處另建木質新橋一座、共二十九孔、計長二百三十</p>
<p>二公尺、橋面線採用拱形、故中間數孔離水面頗高、可容船隻通過、其餘各橋長度、自六公尺至六十餘公尺不等、又全段有鋼筋混凝土涵洞十座、混凝土水管一百五十七道、又自八㘮至平望一段路線、行經三蕩唐家湖馬家蕩三處、湖蕩湖水甚深、取土甚遠、塡築土方頗感困難、目因一面臨河、一面濱湖、將來風浪衝刷路基、坍塌堪虞、乃於路堤兩邊、建築石質護土墻、並在堤坡砌築石坦坡、高出水面、以資防護、計三處湖蕩護土墻共長一千五百餘公尺、用欵達五萬七千餘元、所有全段工程預算、經本會核定者爲五六二·九二○元、由本會借助築路基金一八○·一三四元、㈡浙江段、路基寛度七·五公尺、土方工程共約十三萬五千公方、中舗路面寛三公尺、路面材料、下層用碎磚、上層碎石、蓋此段距澉浦較近、可以採運該處之山石、改酌用碎石路面也、橋樑共十八座、其中嘉興附近之運河橋、工程最大、該處河流旣寛、而往來船隻、尤爲頻繁、故造鋼筋混凝土桁梁橋、以資堅允、全橋八孔、共長七十六公尺、其餘十七座、則均屬木橋、長度自六公尺至二十八公尺不等、所有全段工程預算、經本會核定者爲一四一·四四三元、由本會借助築路基金四五·二六二元、綜計蘇嘉路蘇浙兩段全部工程預算、經本會核定者共爲七○四·三六三元、其中由本會借助之築路基金共爲二二五·三九六元、蘇浙皖三省絡公路中、除杭　　外、當以此路工程最爲　鉅、</p>

<p>次由國際貿易局指導處主任季澤普演說題爲提倡國貨的先决問題、略謂、在未言提倡之前、有種種問題、必須先行解决、然後提倡國貨、才有相當之效果、這是</p>
<p>已往的事實告訴我們的是如此的、余僅就個人的觀察簡單的說、但我所要說的、未必是人人歡迎、不過爲促進國貨的改良與增加消費的購買力起見、願以最勸懇的態度與諸君談談、幸勿誤會、甲關於生産方面的缺乏、我國原爲生産方面的缺乏、我國原爲農業的國家、向來對於工業、是不大注意的、自海禁開放以來、中國每年入超的損失、鉅不可言、故國内有志之士、惄焉憂之、方知工業的重要、非設廠自製、不足以抵制浩大的外溢、現在工廠林立、逐漸發展、此點是極好的現象、但是再進一步觀察、今日我國工業的通病、在初經營時、主其事者、兢兢業業、耐苦耐勞、努力進行研究、氣象蓬勃、出品亦有相當的成績、及一旦金錢寛裕、營業發達、於是對於生産改進、不再加深切研究、繼續努力、結果業務廢弛、出品惡劣這也是我國工業史中不能諱言的、反觀他國工廠、每派人四出調查各種出品、減少成本方法、開辦實業的人、肯繼續不斷的努力與研究、故其事業能根深蒂固、乙同業必妬、是我國商人普遍的弊病、這種心理、種在我們的心中、最能阻止中國工業的發展、我國因同業之競爭、而不惜無謂的犧牲、不知損失了多少生命財産、因此有合作主義的提倡、願國人放大眼光、本合作精神做去、才有抵制外貨的資格·否則便是自欺、在外人所組的國際托辣斯、專重國際上的合作、而與别國競爭、如最近蘇俄的火油、推銷中國時、美孚、亞細亞·德士古·等家、遂聨合戰線、施行跌價、以與蘇俄開始商業的競爭、而與外人以國際的不同、尙能合作、吾人觀此能無愧乎、丙關於消費方面的缺乏、觀强國國民的消費、不是無意識的舉行、一切所用、均購買本國的東西、决不肯輕易把金錢送給外國人、國人肯本此厚利購物、故能國强民富、近觀我國消費者的心理與程度、有許多的地方、實爲呌人悲觀、一·中國一般人是唯一的消費者、因爲他們擁有巨額的資産、故對於一切享用物品的買進、不問是那一國貨、不問是什麽價値、惟以最高貴的最漂亮爲標準、如衣料一疋數十金、紗襪一雙數十元等等、國貨當然是不歡迎的、國内有此種消費者、國貨何能提倡、這是我國消費者大缺點、二·中國一般平民式的消費者、這一般人爲數甚衆、購買力極强、但其中多數没有受過相當敎育、不識國家爲何物、故其所用一切物之購進、不問是非、那一國貨、總以價廉爲標準、所以外國人利用此種弱點、以大批貨物推銷、這也是國貨不充分的暢銷一大原因、除以　産與消費雙方缺點以外、還有一般拜全至義商人、專門推銷外國貨、改牌換號、此亦國貨與洋貨不分淸楚、以致一般愛國自願購用的、他們無所適從了、國内有如此現象存在、國貨不易提倡、最後再觀歐美先進的工業國家、他們的出品可稱爲世界之冠、但是他們猶以爲不足、故對於每一種的出産、年年舉行偉大的展覽會宣傳會、以種種奇特的官傳方法、使全國民衆、深深認識其本國的出品、而工業先進的國家、尙仍努力於國貨的宣傳、後進而尙在糼稚的我國、更當努力於國貨宣傳的工作、俾全國民衆、週知本國各廠出品的特色、然後銷路必日增月盛矣云、次由鄥志豪·凌雲·沈田莘·陳濟成·曹志功·相繼演說、辭長從略、</p>

<p>昨日下午一時、虞仲咸君、用無線電在大中華播音、其題目爲國貨運動之眞諦、略云、今天所要講的、是提倡國貨運動後的辦法、世界上無論那一個民族、没有一個不去弱肉强食、所以從前年九月十八日和去年的一月二十八日到現在、日本軍隊在我們國内所向無敵、節節進佔、任他斬割、這並不是日本軍隊征服我們也並不是日本有多量軍費能征服我們、乃是日本的技能征服我們的、日本人有技能、造精良的槍砲、能造殺人不出血的毒氣、我們並不會造、或不肯吃苦研究製造精良的軍械、最近日本來和我們挑釁、完全可說有工業製造技能的人來征服無工業製造無技能的人、我們要抵　外貨、同時要自已振興工業、若一味勸人家不買外貨、自已仍舊懶着不肯發奮做製造工作、那等於綠木求魚、我們要把抵制二個字、改爲製抵、大家埋首工作、有工業技能的人、盡量從事工業製造、有推銷技能的人、盡量替國貨工廠出品去推銷、有能力購買的人、盡量買國貨、那末外貨不去抵製他、也便在我們市塲上無立足之地了、所要國家振興、非提倡工業不可、要社會上一切鞏固、則非服用國貨不可云云、</p>

<p>該局江海各輪二十五艘、所用輪機人員、共有八十人、其工薪較各輪駕駛部人員爲低、各輪機員、以船員中駕駛輪機、責職相等、英商太古怡和等、對於兩部人員待遇、亦同等相若、獨招商局對駕駛部薪工、特别優異、而於輪機部之工薪、異常苛薄、現當生活程度高漲之際、全體輪機員、一致公决、要求比照駕駛部工資實行增加、即經全體具名蓋章、呈請劉經理照辦、</p>

<p>春秋裸體運動  百合　　有人說，穿衣服，有「禦寒」，「禦暑」之功，所以冷天要穿「羊毛絨」，可禦外來的寒氣，熱天要穿「法闌絨」，可禦外來的暑氣。又有人說，人類本來是有「抵抗寒暑的能力」的。遠在上古時代的我們的老祖宗，不懂得穿衣或帽，但是一活就是二百年，三百歲。後來大家穿衣服了，人類的皮膚，不能受日光雨　的侵襲，　「抵抗力」逐漸衰退，於是人類的壽命日促。這二個理論，各有「無可駁斥」的理由，但根本上，又是「矛盾」的。　　有人說，穿衣服，是表示「人，不是畜生」，所以懂得禮貎，而會穿衣戴帽。警察老爺見了「赤膊人」，捉進警局去，罰洋二元，當給汗衫一件，以警其「有礙觀瞻」。電車裏「吸烟」，「吸痰」，皇皇禁令，儘可「視若無睹」，惟有「赤膊人」，雖無「禁止乘車」的明文，往往會給賣票的趕下去，原因是太「野蠁」了。又有人說，性器官被深蔽固拒在衣服裏，輕易不肯示人，於是大家對於與「耳，目，口，鼻」，同爲人身上器官之一的「生殖器」，發生了不可思議的神秘，而造成了一切關於「性」的罪惡。若是大家赤裸裸地一絲不掛，你也有性器官，我也有性器官，正如大家都生着耳目口鼻，誰還會大驚小怪。這二個理論，又都是「頭頭是道」，但又根本「矛盾」得不知所云。　　這幾年來，中國經「洋大人」與「高等華人」的薰陶敎育，大家逐漸地懂得「赤身裸體」，非但「不合衛生」，而且是「野蠁透頂」的大道理。但是爲「增加人體抵抗力」，爲「消滅性器官的神」秘性」，而提倡的「裸露運動」，將由香港伸展到上海來了。在這「各走極端」，而「各有千秋」的理論之下，我們這些「看樣學樣」的上海人，究竟是「衣冠濟楚」好呢，還是「赤身裸體」好？這倒是很費躊躇的。第三件大事  眞　　中委吳稚暉，最近在央大學第六屆畢業典禮中代表中央黨部致訓詞時，講及中山先生遺訓，敎人莫要做大官而要去做大事。於是分析目前的大事，說除抗日剿匪兩件在事外，眼前又發生第三件大事。坐在中央大禮中的數千聽衆，一時都想不出所謂第三件大事，穷何所指：及至經了相當時間的頓挫，方被其一語道破，曉得就是防水問題，眼前正是水患頻聞，災象又告寰呈的時期：江河已在拍岸盈堤，這正是報紙上最引人注目的大事呀！　　這第三件大事，不僅是我們的心腹之患，而且是這奄奄一息的民族最大的致命傷！因爲洪水不獨無情，且又無絲毫理性可言。對於敵人猶可含垢求和，對於洪水便談不到妥協屈服。如果洪水再造成民國二十年時代的潰决泛濫的形勢，演下第二幕慘劇，那麽，中國雖大，人民雖多，恐怕是再經不起如此波折了。四萬萬人。這是老統計，眼前要眞正計算起來，當然要有相當的折扣：將來這折扣是不是愈過愈少呢？那就只有天曉得了！　　好在中國人有「大而化之」的精神，俗語說：「大事化小，小事化了」。有如此法術的人，目前恐不算少。只要有人從中「點化」，那又何必大驚小怪呢？假如說：「中國人成事不足」，却不如說：「中國人化事有餘」。試想這第三件大事在前年也旣發生過，及至國難會議將其定爲三大主要議題，等到會議閉幕，不是早經被人遺忘了嗎？這算什麽大事。也許是報紙過甚其詞呀！叛逆之自負  王羽　　九一八後薈萃於長春的羣醜，在我們筆底下，不諡之爲叛逆，即諡之爲傀儡；若只給他一個「僞」字帽兒。那已經算得最平心靜氣的了。但在羣醜自已，却也頗自負得很。如鄭孝胥輩，或以中興名臣自擬，或以開國元勳自命。煕洽還對人說：誰是漢奸？半年後再看罷！意思是他們乃眞實建國，半年後即有成績給人看，並不損絲毫主權，那些口稱救國而暗中斷送無限國權的，　眞是漢奸呢！這自然是大傀儡溥儀甫抵長春時說的話；後來事實全然不對，煕洽的心裏不免恨日本食言而肥，嘴裏却說不出，也只好永遠恨在心裏罷了。我曾看見幾張關外出版的舊報，恰好載有鄭孝胥的大作七律二首，一首是「壽陳寳琛」，詩道：「天迴朔漠作神京，國老東來舉世驚，八十五齡眞好漢，重陽半月見耆英，中興方略資長策，北地豪雄待主盟，細楷淸詩時一出，知公不減舊時情。」又一首是「重九感事，」詩道：「壯年猶記戌南荒，脫向空桐惜鬢霜，自竄豈甘作遺老，獨醒誰與遣重陽？菊花未見秋無色，雁信常遲海已桑！定有遺黎思故主，登高試爲叩蒼蒼。」看是多麽自負，不但自稱「國老」。而且是「東來舉世驚」：又；因他「自竄豈甘作遺老」，便料到「定有遺黎思故主」；其實，除掉鄭孝胥一流的老悖而外，誰的腦筋裏有溥儀的影子存在呢？又有人說：鄭孝胥輩最初是把日本看做契丹，以爲石敬塘大可以做得；誰知事實上連劉豫都不如。劉豫在宋建炎四年，受金人册立爲皇帝，國號大齊，都大名府，屢引金人入寇不利，金人惡之，仍爲金人所廢。但劉豫到底還僭位八年，而且較溥儀自由快活得多，溥儀如何比得上劉豫呢？水深火熱勢人  祝融氏　　驕陽逼人，夏日可畏，大地的熱度，逐漸隨寒暑表飛騰沸漲。這幾天，「歇夏」·「避暑」等時髦名詞·應運　　。牯嶺·普陀，莫干山，　時充滿了　多關人踪跡；山中淸凉幽靜，確可一　煩熱，不過，像我們無錢的小民，衣食尙虞不給，那只好是任赤帝的熏炙，望山興歎了！　　「如火益深，如炎益熱」這是先哲比喩民生疾苦的論調：不幸在今日之社會，一言而中。哀哀生靈，葬生於水火中者，何可勝計。今年，可佈的水患，已現在眼前，洪水汎濫，到處　流，各省陷於泥濘中的同胞，又不知有若干萬人。聽說九江方面，水勢大漲，人民多往廬山避水；即小康之家，亦扶老挈糼，相率登山。向以避暑著名的勝地，一變而爲避水的塲所，滑稽之至；可是第窮苦小民，眼望高山而不能登，痛苦萬狀，行政當局，應如何使人民出水火而登袵席，這實是當務之急，不容一刻緩了。　　湘省主席何鍵，對於水災有極沉痛的演說。地說：天災流行，固然是古今中外所不能免，但依中國古代學者的評論，天災時變，都關係執政的德行如何爲斷。所以湖南省水患，他認爲是本人德薄行疏，不足以感召祥和而消弭於無形，異常可恥。我們對於何主席這種言論，當然表示敬佩，可是人類的血太冷了，要能遇事就抱羞恥心，國家也不致糟到如此。唉！水深火熱小民將無噍類矣東北四連長  張恨水第十回　聞語警芳心封侯願渺　　聽歌現羨色報國身閑　　桂枝道：誰家不是這樣呀？我也不會抽烟。劉家媽道你媽會抽烟呀。桂枝道：那抽得起烟捲買一點關東烟葉子抽抽罷了。我嫌那味兒難聞，我媽也就不抽了。劉家媽說着話，親熱起來了，在坑邊一張破椅子上坐下了，點點頭道：也虧你娘兒倆遨着過這日子。聽說你們後院搬進一家院鄰來了，幹什麽的？桂枝心中一想，是機會了，便道：是個當連長的。劉家媽道：又是當軍人的。有孩子嗎？桂枝笑道：人家還没有家眷呢。這兒住着一個老太爺和一個聽差的。那連長几天回來一趟倒是很安靜的。劉家媽道：這老太爺有多大歲數了？桂枝道：大槪有六十多了吧？劉家媽却歎了一口氣道：這樣大歲數，幹嗎讓兒子當軍人呀？只有這一句話，不必再問其他，就知道劉家媽對於當兵這一件事情，充分的不滿意。因笑道：由大兵升到了連長，那可是不容易。人家靠了這兒子，吃喝穿住，什麽都全有了，你怎麽倒說是不好的意思呢？劉家媽道：升到一個連長這當然是不容易的事情。若是一個大兵升到這步田地的話，恐怕腦袋瓜，已經抓在手上玩了無數回。因爲這樣，所以我說别把兒子去當兵。桂枝正有一句話，想要問出來呢，却聽得窗户外面微微的有人咳嗽了兩聲。劉家媽笑道：是牛老先生嗎？請進來我正有事要求着您呢？說時門外又咳嗽了幾聲，然後那们牛先生走了進來。桂枝看時，倒是一位年近六旬的老先生。身穿一件鐵灰棉袍，拖着下擺一排紐扣，不曾扣着。上身穿了一件黑布棉馬褂，也是將胸襟敞着。在這裏，可以看到他棉袍子胸襟上闊了無數的油酒汚痕，和烟火燒跡。頭上戴了一頂三塊瓦的皮帽子，可是皮這個字，也不過徒有其名，那皮子被風雪蛀蟲所傷，很像是水漬的棉絮。兩隻袖口，摸遍了油膩像膏藥一樣　。（一一四）　　短訊舊都洪君，喜古玩，收藏甚富，此次挾其所藏，避地海上，設珊林於三馬路廣西路口，開幕之日，并開一展覧會，銅磁書畫賣石，無一不精，有象牙實石嵌成四妃十六子之屏，象牙嵌玉柴檀櫥，及三彩十八羅漢，皆爲故言遺物。名貴非常，書畫則有傳靑主之山水，楊繼盛之行書，黄山谷之山水，新羅山人阮元唐寅等手卷，又有大批漢玉，紅赤如血，大半故都知名精品云。小工藝小資本的一種恒業  天虚我生　　近以失業恐慌，欲謀小工業而問計於我者，富繁有徒。管爲種種策劃，期於短時間，能使不能者能有一種恒業，不但可以自利，而並利及於人，實惟利用箋封事業，最爲穏妥。但付二百元押櫃，即可獨佔一區，無患後起者之攘奪，若至厭倦之際，無意經營，仍可收回其原有資本，而在平日，卽使毫無生意，亦仍有月息一分，可以收人。此在資本上之穏固，殆無可與比，惟於設備上之支配方法當如左述，庶無竭厥之虞。　　㈠本人於箋封上，無經騐者、宜在就地雇一舊式紙店中之「一把連」工人，所謂一把連者，舉凡箋封簿摺四種出品，印訂切三項工作皆能之，大都由學徒出身，稱爲做手者是。印刷祗需木板，切紙則用拖刀，訂賬簿用穿線，均可不用機器，而能改進一步，爲機器一般之印刷。此等工人，但托紙店家介紹雇用，必不乏人，其月薪大致由十元至十六元足矣，供給膳宿，至多不過每日工飯資八角而已。單以印信紙論，尋常發出别家去印，每千四角，今如雇工自印，每日平均可印出四千，每千祗核二角，即一日可賺八角，除去顔料及消耗等，至少可得二十元一月，若有兩人工作，卽得四十元矣　　㈡應用木板，皆可就地向刻字店刻，並不必需鉛板，蓋木板亦可用油墨印，其出品與鉛石印者相同。但在始作之際，爲工人駕輕就熟計，祗就木板水印一端進行，亦已足　安排。信紙行從普通八行人手，發由小店代售，但計也。賬簿一項，手續較繁，實爲家庭間之良好工業，例如工人但顧印切，其摺工訂工，可由婦孺爲之。信封經摺，則發出裱，而由工人敎授婦孺摺做，不久亦必綽綽乎能之。　如五口之家，本來坐食無所事事，今如每人每日平均能出工資二角，以五人計月入可三十元，加以工人出品，餘利亦得二十元，是即僅僅雇用一人，已得五十元之月入，若由自已一人，向外求謀五十元之月薪，竊恐不易得也。卽使得之，猶有或失之患，因其權不自操，非恒業耳。故於本業當以恒心自勵，庶幾有成。　　㈢應用紙料，本不限用何種牌號，惟利用紙尺寸較大，質地較厚，比用普通連史毛邊爲合算，例如普通連史，爲２５×４４，　７×１１信紙，每令僅七千，利用連史，爲２８×４４，可開八千，如裱信封，則兩層可抵三層，十二户可開十五，十五户可開十八，十八户可開二十，二十四户可開二十八，均比普通爲多。至其開時，則凡一把連工人能之，利用毛邊尺寸，亦較普通爲大，普通爲２５×５２，利用則３０×５５，用做賬簿，可以拕打，全無蹧耗。（以上尺寸均係英寸，）且凡利用箋封經理，購人利用廠紙，如銷不出，尙可退還，故其穏健爲任何工業所不及也。　　㈣第一個月，全爲籌備出品期間，欲向外面兜攬定貨生意，可向利用事務所先進現貨箋封五六十元，並配原令之紙如下。（甲）２８×４４元字連史五令。（乙）３０×５５本色毛邊五令。（丙）３０×５５白毛邊兩令。（丁）３０×４４湖色報紙兩令。（戊）２８×４４海月兩令。　　上列之紙。（甲）印信箋用，（乙）印賬簿，（丙）印如意箋，（丁）與（戊）裱信封用，兩層可抵三層，或用（甲）二層（乙）一層亦可。如上支配，儘可周轉，凡有定印牌號之件，自已不能印者，可托大陸商塲三樓利用事務所代印，固無爲難處也。</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊夏令用品與消費心理  仰葊　　國貨工廠的出品，第一在迎合消費者之心理，倘出品不合消費者的胃口，任你怎樣宣傳，怎樣廉價，總是没有多大効力的。消費者的代表，可算是家庭的主婦。家庭三大半購貨的權力，都在主婦掌握之中。所以工廠出品，與其說迎合消費者的心理，不如說迎合一般家庭主婦的心理。主婦旣爲消費的代表，凡　明的主婦，時時刻刻在研究市場出品的趨勢，物質的選擇，留意一般心理的轉移。有時有指導出品者改善的任務，有時有指導一般消費者抉擇的方法。故就製造出品者立場而方：最好應時時刻刻在追求消費者的心理，迎頭趕上，絲毫不肯放鬆，那麽出品才有進步，銷路才可暢旺。一天無意中和方液仙君閒談，方君對着中國國貨公司的一位職員說，吾看市場女子衣服穿大花式的多了，應該注意這點才好。這幾句話，吾很佩服方君隨時隨地在用他的心思，顧到一般消費者的心理。一天國貨産銷合作協會承張禹九君的紹介，請到一位余英傑夫人到會談談。余夫人是一位熱心國貨的主婦，生長美國，久居上海，生平最致力於出品的研究，和消費者的心理。好她劈頭第一句：便說國貨的製造，第一要合着消費者的心理。一成不變，最是大忌。即以衣飾而論，美國人是跟着法國人走的，總是落後一步。譬如在美國風行大花式時候，法國已風行條子式了。我們苟不研究，不要說事事落後，貨物呆滯，即在國際市場，怎樣可以立足？又說中國人的心理，以爲價錢便宜，便算盡其能事，可是價廉而物質不好，消費者也要望望然而去之。其實有一般人倒不在價廉，而在經用與精美，這點希望國貨工廠，千萬注意，粗製濫造，終究要失敗的。這一番話，眞是至理名言。　　吾現在根據余夫人的話，來談夏令用品，夏令用品不出六個字：㈠時式不論那種出品，第一在入時，不入時的出品，只好擺在故物保存會作古董的陳列，有時夾出品中間，反而減損其他出品的推銷力。所以製造者的出品，第一在推陳出新，時時研究市場的趨勢，迎頭追趕，才不落後。　　㈡顔色夏令用品，第二在顔色，夏令是赤日炎炎，最忌觸目刺目的顔色。所以素潔雅靜，是最最惹人喜歡，而最最合人口味的。　　㈢靈巧便捷靈巧，是任何出品的要素，而以夏令出品爲尤宜。夏令的室内，是尙空曠，故物品的容積，最忌笨重而佔地位。夏令的個人，是尙輕便，故物品的式樣，最忌累墜，而艱於取携。如果明白此點，那麽便可博得顧客歡迎，消費者滿意。　　因此，我們便出了這夏令國貨用品專號，許多文字，都可供製造者和消費者的參考。希望大家切實指敎。我的夏日用品  寒梅　　夏之神已經展開殘酷的翅膀降臨到人間，到處擴張着熱的權威。稱爲萬物之靈的人們，究竟比較聰明？报以時時在計劃着如何避免熱的施與。　　在這個國將不國的年頭兒，我們夏天的用物，總揀選經濟的實惠的，外國貨在我們的心目中，壓根兒没有微細的迷戀，但是，也不能去留戀啊！　　現在，把我的日用品，大略地報告一下：　　關於衣着的　　長衫和短衫褲三友實業社出品的中華紗，取其質地細潔，着肉軟滑，出汗不黏，價錢也非常便宜。天氣比較風凉的時候，穿的長衫，也用三友社出品的「維也納」，因爲維納富有彈性，不易起縐，而且顔色永遠不退。汗衫五和織造廠出品的鵝牌汗衫，因質地牢，最易吸汗。　　草帽華福廠冠益廠合豐廠出品的草帽，價錢便宜，美觀耐用。　　關於洗浴的　　浴巾三友社出品的一種七十三號浴巾，每條祗費二角九分，洗過冷水浴，乾擦全身，十分爽快舒適，夜裏也可以當小被頭蓋。　　浴皂是五洲藥房的藥水皂，功能殺菌滅毒，有益衛生。　　浴衣洗過浴，乘風凉談談天時候，恐怕受風寒的侵襲，所以到三友社去買一件浴衣來穿穿，雖然價錢要二元多，但是穿過以後，不但是穿脫便利，而且十分凉爽，夜裏可當睡衣用。　　擦背帶也是三友社買的，因爲擦背時用擦背帶，易去垢，省力。　　關於床上用的　　帳子用帳子，本來是怪討厭的，但是蚊子可惡，所以祇得到三友社去買頂衛生帳子，價錢倒要六元多，不過很風凉，一些不覺得悶熱。　　被單薄被頭，枕頭，差不多完全是三友社包辦的，别人或者要說，你給三友社做義務廣告，並不，三友社的貨物，實在很實惠，經濟，値得相信的國貨商店。　　關於其他：：　　蚊蟲香夜裏要練習功課，房間裏蚊子翁翁翁鬧得討厭，所以中國化學工業社的三星蚊蟲香，差不多像驅蚊使者，蚊蟲自會不趕而逃的。　　毛巾三角牌毛巾的好處，中國人差不多統已曉得，我很歡喜用，因爲它洗到破也不發硬。　　洗衣皂五洲大業藥房出的固本皂，因爲它質佳，去垢最易，所以我們十分樂用的。夏令衣着之研究  年　　天氣一天一天的熱了，乃摩登女郎都換起細薄的紅綠的紗羅，招搖過市，確引起不少人的注目；又其是被風吹起時的玉腿處，然而社會上財富的閒暇的到底是少數，那大多數的民衆，雖在烈日如虎的炎夏，總是仍要爲生活而奮鬥；然而天氣無論熱到如何程度，衣着是不可少的，因每日需要更換的綠故，其費用也不在春衣之下；在這裏就生出一個重大的問題，是關於採用材料方面的，依鄙人的意見，應有下列二項的認識：　　質料方面須細潔而堅牢，避免過薄，切合實用者，以棉織品爲上；因爲牠是較爲吸收水份的，　　顔色方面以白色爲最好，婦女之愛美者，也應選其較淡淡的，如湖色妃色，深色黑色應在避免之例，因爲她是要吸收熱光的；花樣雖各有所愛，也以一色或較少者爲上·　　負有以上二條的國貨，現在市上確有很多，但你須顧到二點，是否國貨商店出賣？是否包不退色的？因爲常有不恥之徒，將日貨冒冲國貨，以貪厚利；所以價格方面，也以勿過便宜爲是，</p>

<p>[夏令服裝的五「要」  侖晋　　要輕飄丨一個身材婀娜的妙齡女郎，如果在夏令中穿了襲輕飄的服裝，　加顯出嫵媚動人。假使你在這炎炎的夏令中，穿了呆板而笨重的服裝，保你會汗流挾背，一口氣都伸不過來哩。要美觀丨服裝的第一個目的，當然是蔽體，但同時我們也不容否認，它底　　第二個目的是在於助長我們天賦身體的更臻美化。尤其是在夏令的時候，八們的衣服穿的很少，肉體美和曲線美，很容易流露出來，人們的服要堅牢丨夏令中衣服時常要換洗，所以做的服裝，第一要注意到堅牢的才行。　　要低廉丨環顧我們的四週，社會經濟是如此衰落，所以我們應該注意點儉樸才行。都市中的摩登女郎們或許還會根本京不贊成。不過你們應想一想：在陜西的妙齡女郎們連一條短褲也没得穿哩！　　要國貨丨近年來國貨工廠努力的結果，可以做夏令服裝的衣料很多，貨色堅牢耐穿，價錢又公道，我們做夏令服的時候，萬萬不可以再買外貨衣料了。鄕村同胞的夏令國貨用品  朱山秀　　一天到晚，一年到頭埋着頭工作的鄉村同胞，他們不懂什麽呌摩登，他們也不羨慕人家的舒適生活；只要你到鄕村中去走走，總可聽到這樣的說話：「一切是命中注定的。」啊！多麽曠達呀！　　殘酷的炎夏，又降臨了人間，大人先生少爺小姐們，不消說，汽水，電扇，案頭牀裏，隨處都有；并且，莫干山北戴河的别墅，也早已大掃除過，等待他們的大駕去度那淸凉的生活了。只有鄕村的同胞，都露出了醬色的背板和壯碩的臂腿，仍在烈日下掙扎。這時，他們的用品，第一要推頭上戴的笠帽，「笠帽，」在城市中，或許有人會不知這個名辭，牠是像草帽般的，不過中間是圓錐形而頂稍鈍，邊綠也稍大而已。雖然一頂笠帽不能蔭蔽他們的全身，可是，在他們已覺舒服多了。第二就要算一尺見方的一塊藍土布的手帕，這塊手帕，能盡量吸收他們如雨的汗液，　了，就到河邊去洗一下，再拿牠揩到身上時，那種淸凉的感覺，是含着麥柴管舐吸汽水者所不能領略的。第三，一把芭蕉扇是少不了的，他們工餘休息時，將牠緩緩的一搖一搖，却也不較電風扇的效力稍遜；一到晚上，以食血爲生的蚊子吵得利益，牠又做了他們的義務保鏢者。　　鄕村的同胞，他們不懂什麽呌摩登，他們也不羨慕人家的舒適生活，在這炎熱的夏令，他們有了前面的三種道道地地的國貨用品丨笠帽，手帕，芭蕉扇。丨就已滿足了皇后的夏令服裝  詩典　　是一個夏令的早晨。　　如火如茶的太陽漸漸地高張天空，宇宙間充滿了薰天的暑氣。　　××路上有一輛一九三三年工的汽車疾飛狂奔向明華大學去。車中坐着三個女大學生丨丨陳麗芳，張愛娜，和褚琴芬。她們三個是校裏同級而且同一寢室裏的最知已的同學。不論在寢室裏，運動塲上，校園裏，甚至在課室裏，三人總是形影不離的，很親蜜的聚在一處。每逢星期一的早晨，她們三人必邀集後，共同乘一輛汽車到校裏去，好在她們家裏都是資産階級，大家有自備的汽車，因此彼此接送一點兒也不感覺麻繁。她們都是婀娜多姿的妙齡女郎，尤其是那個陳麗芳小姐，生得更是美麗；鹅蛋般的臉兒，苗條得彷佛楊柳般的細腰。飄飄欲墜。她在她們三人中，固然是最漂亮了，就是在全校的女同學們中也還没有和他同樣美麗的。她又能很安詳　和男同學們交際，落落大方，絲毫没有　　之態，可以便每一個和她交接過的男同學都感到大大的滿意和崇讚。大學中雖然没有公開選舉什麽皇后的事，可是在明華大學中的每個男同學心之深處，都早已默認陳麗芳小姐是他們校裏的皇后了。的確，除了陳麗芳小姐之外，誰還有這樣的資格呢？所以，儘有很多的男同學們去追求她，願意犧牲一切去拜倒於她底石榴裙下呢。　　汽車很迅速地到明華大學門口停下，三個小姐同時奔向宿舍走去。自然嘍，美麗皇后走過去時候，是免不了要受同學們之注視的。可是這天的陳麗芳益加受到男同學們熱烈的注視而欣慕，他們瘋狂般的千百道眼珠，　自死釘着陳麗芳的身上，陳小姐也感覺到很滿意，這因爲這天陳小姐穿着最新式而輕飄的新式服裝，這般服裝在社會上還是最近發現，明華大學裏更是從來没有見過的美麗服裝，怪不得男同學們要注視了。　　講到這件漂亮服裝的來歷，却也是陳麗芳坐生活史上很光榮的一幕。原來最近著名××國貨機關，爲着充實提倡國貨的力量和喚醒酣睡着的國民起見，曾經與行過一次偉大的國貨時裝展覧會，同時請很多的熱心名媛參加時裝表演，陳麗芳也應他們的請求，去參加表演過。她那天穿的服裝衣料完全用的國貨，一切零件也全用國貨，式樣可是别出新裁的合於美化。穿了之後，輕飄自如，使她苗條的軀體，愈顯出嫵媚動人。大博全塲觀衆的讚許。她對於國貨，以往是很不瞭解的，差不多根本就卑視的。這天出乎意外的見到國貨居然這樣的美麗輕巧；她便在展覽會中當塲向那家公司定做了同樣的三襲。這天早晨穿的便是新做的一襲國貨服裝。　　美麗的皇后，如今是更顯出美麗了。同學們見到這襲衣後，便紛紛轟合開去，一刹那之間，這消息便傳遍了全校。陳小姐從寢室裏出去的時候，同學們見了之後，大家都稱讚而欣慕，每一個同學對於這位皇后是更其顯出信任了。　　全校的女同學們服裝，向來是跟着皇后的步驟而走的。一旦看到皇后穿着這美麗的國貨夏令服裝，衣料確是不差，式樣又美觀，價錢也公道，大家都紛紛照樣服用國貨夏裝起來，不到幾天，全校的女同學，竟完全穿用國貨服裝了　　他校的女同學見到明華大學女生都穿國貨夏裝，而且她們看那些國貨時裝確是很美麗，所以她們都紛紛抛棄過去崇拜外貨主義，大家都服用起國貨服裝起來。　　社會上女性的服裝，向來是處處模仿女學生的。如今見到各校的女生都穿起國貨服裝起來，這類國貨價錢又便宜，貨色又堅牢，恰適合他們的胃口。大家也都瘋狂般的爭先恐後服用國貨服裝起來。　　茲後市塲上到處都是些花花綠綠的國貨衣料，可咒的外貨絶跡了。歸根結蒂，這偌大的功勞，首先要推我們明華大學的皇后陳麗芳女士那　　貨夏令服裝呢？貢獻於各界人士採購夏令用品前  玄萬　　時序的推進，我們這莊嚴偉大的國貨年，也跟着很快的已過去了二分之一，而遇到這『夏』的來臨了。氣候的熱度，旣是一天高上一天，一個人每日的起居生活，自然也要因着炎暑的侵襲，而發生新的更迭，所以。在這個時候，我們所急需的各種夏令用品，正是要經過一度的購備，那是必然的。不過。我們跑向各大商塲去，貨品雜　，五光十色，似乎很有些無從採擇的感想，那麽我就趁這各界人士還未採購之前，敢先貢獻一個肯定的原則：『務須精緻的國貨生。』國人用國貨，這是國民自已的天職，我想無論何人都能深切明瞭的，我們可就再在他的原則的附帶傑件下，所謂怎樣　是『淸潔：：：：：：』加以詳細的分析，且資介紹。　　㈠服裝夏令服裝，首宜淸潔，洗濯更換，凉爽怡快，均爲我們所極重，以敝人數年來服用國貨經騐所得，則敢舉如三友實業社之各種夏令布疋。毛巾浴巾，五和織造廠之鹅牌蔴紗汗衫，中國内衣公司之ＡＢＣ運動衣褲，舒適美觀，耐洗便利，四者悉備，洵屬夏令服裝中宜用的國産佳品。　　㈡食品夏令食品，最好能戒除葷腥，多服素菜，通常冷食，則冠生園之各種冷食罐頭，淸潔美味，適合衛生，而三星之觀音粉，天廚之味精，尤皆爲　味良品，蓋夏令力避油膩，大可用以和　，素菜淸湯，新鮮適口，大足爲加餐之助。　　㈢用具時届夏令，一切日常用品，自較他日爲繁，但均係用以淸潔夏令衛生，保護個人健康·故亦並非浪費，普通如以三星牌之蚊香，華生之電扇，用以驅蚊驅暑，立鶴牌之各種搪瓷面盆，洗衣盆，用以洗面洗衣，無敵牌，嫦娥牌之爽身粉，用以吸汗爽身，華福之草帽，用以出外遮陽，五洲固本皂之用以洗澣衣服，亞林防疫水之用以殺菌滅毒，是悉爲家喩户曉，風行全國，久爲社會樂用之品，自亦不須細舉瑣述。　　以上所述，皆不過其螢大者。以個人之所知，篇幅之有限，自然不能盡量羅舉，遺漏必多，所幸現在我們的國貨總庫丨中國國貨公司，正已集中一切國産貨品，應有盡有，金碧輝煌，無美不備，是乃『精英薈萃』『國貨之光』深望各界人士，翩然戾止，熱心提倡，任意採購，果能集中一切夏令消費在這裏，定可使你整個夏令的滿意。鄕人的夏天國貨用品種種  蓮如　　不銷，　　罩這東西，在大都會裏，或富貴人家的家裏，是用不到的，他們有的是冰箱，自然不用把食物放在檯桌上陰凉，當然不會使蒼蠅停留到食物上去，而散佈病菌種子；但是這東西在鄉下或窮人家是夏天惟一的防止蒼蠅的蠅無從散佈病菌種子，又可除去灰塵的吹到食物上去，還可把有罩罩上的食物搬到通風的地方，不致食物腐敗；况且這竹絲罩使用時十分便利，價錢又便宜，祗幾角錢一隻，買了一隻，可用到三四年；並且這確是道地十足的國貨，我担保没有洋貨來魚目混珠，諸位家裏可試買一隻。　　除了竹絲罩這東西外，鄕下用以捕捉蒼蠅的，還有蒼蠅拍和玻璃罩，蒼蠅拍祇幾分一個，拍時很便利，祇一舉手之勞，就可殺去蒼蠅一隻，但是農人没有多大的工夫　幹這事，所以用的還少；玻璃罩在鄭村裏用的也有，他並不須農人化許多功夫，所以用的也有，不過他要幾角錢一只，而且很容易碰破，所以没有竹絲罩那樣的普遍。　　同蒼蠅一樣可惡的，還有蚊虫，他們能傳染瘧疾給人，和擾亂人的睡眠；尤其在鄕下蚊虫格外的多，而農人又是須在夜裏安全的休息，一方面恢復過去的疲勞，一方面要預備明天的工作，所以他們痛恨蚊虫比蒼蠅還勵害；現在他們已用兩種工業品來代替從前的舊方法，一種是土製的工業品，蚊烟　，他是用木屑做原料，用國貨皮紙包裏而成，也是道地的國貨，每條祇須銅元兩三枚，效力比較舊方法大得多，所以鄕下人用的和竹絲罩一樣的普遍；到了現在，有少數的鄕人也知用眞正的工業品，丨蚊烟香，蚊烟香的價錢比較蚊烟條大，而效力也大一半多，用起來時間也長久，所以在鄕下已漸漸的通行了，將來不可限量哩！但是我很希望各製造蚊烟香的工廠，最好把價錢減低些，使鄕人有享受的機會，而能普遍鄕下，以上就是鄕人在夏天裏的幾種國貨用品。夏令國貨防疫品  文鎧　　到了夏天，瘟疫就很利害的流行，每年總有許多人，因爲染上時疫而致喪失了生命。所以在這危險的夏令，我們對於防疫的工作，絶對不容忽視。　　瘟疫要怎樣預防呢？我們知道蒼蠅，臭蟲，蚊子，這些都是傳染疫病的生物，還有濳伏在陰濕地方的各種毒菌，乘機向人類進攻！我們除過要注意每日飲食起居外，更要時時施用防疫殺菌的藥物。　　國貨防疫品，據我所知有五洲藥房的「亞林防疫臭水」，是很有效力的，夏令每天用「亞林臭水」和水澆灑各處，就可以殺滅一切的毒菌，防止疫　的傳染。還有五洲的「地球牌殺蚊香」，「立斃臭蟲粉」，都是很　騐的夏令國貨。零訊國産蚊香暢銷　　今年市上國貨蚊烟香，以永和實業公司之月裏嫦娥牌三星牌及無敵牌等銷數最鉅，因此劣貨完全絶跡。月裏嫦娥滅蚊香並附有猜數獎，頭獎有五百元之希望，聞連日剪取本報前去猜獎者極多。國貨華而紗襪問世　　本埠三馬路廣昇祥襪廠爲襪業創設最早者，平時營業發達，現該廠梁君元敬發明國産華而紗襪一種，質料細潔，經穿耐洗，且定價極廉。凡憑此新聞往購者，可得九折利益云。國貨工廠之厄運　　上海市國貨橡膠製品業公會前爲會員正泰永和兩廠，所投保之洋商火險，有留難拒賠情事，特組專門委員會，辦理一切，昨致函市商會，請求據理交涉。原函略謂：查敝會會員正泰橡膠廠，於本年二月間不幸發生火災，損失甚鉅，該廠平日本保有火險，事後卽向承保之公司交涉，詎承保該廠火險之地球皇家蘭鉛司脫亞拉音司四洋商保險公司，竟藉詞拒絶，在同月間尙有同業永和廠，亦發生火災，據聞承保該廠之洋商保險公司多家，雖將起火原因調查明確，仍多方留難，敝同業聞訊之餘，羣起恐慌，良以敝同業之保險，其繳納保費，較普通平安保險爲鉅，敝同業均置有鍋爐及汽油等機件，各該保險公司於承保之時，均所詳悉，倘竟於事後藉詞拒絶則敝同業所投保之火險將一無保障：：云云。本刊啟事　　本刊下期續出「夏令國貨專號」五日内繼續收稿；倘以精美挿　或照片見惠者，尤所歡迎。短篇小說不平之鳴  秦瘦鷗　　這一天，我眞是氣悶極了，滿肚子焚燒着不平的怒火，使我忍無可忍，以致于不顧了一切的長嘯起來。「呼！」「呼！」「呼！」。　　不消幾響，早驚動了滿店的人，大家不由一齊驚慌失措起來。有幾個胆小的簡直嚇得腿都軟了。　　「呀！這架風扇不曾挿電，怎麽會自已轉起來呢？」許多人都像碰到了妖怪一般的狂呌着。　　讀者們！其實我却不是什麽妖怪，乃是一架電風扇！我的主人名喚「華生，」在中國是一個很有名氣的大人物。當初，他老人家費了許多的心思，才創造出我們這一班弟兄來；而且我們弟兄個個都是身强體壯，力大無窮，逢到夏天，着實能替人們立些汗馬功勛。　　我是第一百零八班裏的一個。可是不幸得很，偏是給我們主人派我上這裏來做什麽「樣品；」因爲這地方的人，年常慣用外國風扇，把無數的好洋錢送給洋鬼子們去受用，所以我們主人敎我去獻獻身手，讓他們覺悟過來，改用自已的國貨。　　不料我在這家電料店裏住了半個月工夫，雖然已在許多人的面前，獻過幾次身手，而且還跟一個名喚「奇異」的脚色比試過，實在不　於他；可是這地方的人竟是生成奴性，一聽我是本國人，便不約而同地冷笑着，誰也不願帶我回去，寗可出了比我高三四倍的代價，帶那些外國貨回去。　　我這一般不平之氣越積越深，終于忍不住「不平而鳴」了；可怪這店裏的人全不懂我的意思，反道我是成了精了，來不及的把我推進一問黑漆的貨棧裏去關着。　　「老兄，你怎麽也來了？」我正在氣得傷心的時候，旁邊忽然有人向我說話起來。我定神一瞧，原來是幾位身材矮小，遍體發光的燈泡先生。算起來我們也是五百年前同一家，彼此原係熟人，便各訴離衷。原來他們奉了主人「亞浦耳」之命，也到這裏來充樣品，結果也是失敗；因此他們同伴中，就有一位自已跳下櫥階而死，店主人認爲不祥，便在一個月前把他們　進來了。　　「我們幾時才能出頭呢？」他們很悲傷地感慨着。　　「待中國人一覺睡醒的時候，我們便可以重見天日了！」我懷着一重熱望，勉强家對着他們。</p>

<p>自由談「喫白相飯」  旅隼　　要將上海的所謂「白相」改作普通話，只好是「玩要」，至於「喫白相飯」，那恐怕還是用文言譯作「不務正業，游蕩爲生」，對於外鄕人可以比較的明白些。　　游蕩可以爲生，是很奇怪的。然而在上海問一個男人，成向一個女人問她的丈夫的職業的時候，有時會遇到極直截的回答道：「喫白相飯的。」　　聽的也並不覺得奇怪，如同聽到了說「敎書」，「做工」一樣。倘說是「没有什麽職業」，他倒會有些不放心了。　　「喫白相飯」在上海是這麽一種光明正大的職業。　　我們在上海的報章上所看見的，幾乎常是這些人物的功績：没有他們，本埠新聞是决不不熱鬧的。但功續雖多，歸納起來也不過是三段，只因爲未必全用在一件事情上，所以看起來就好像五花八門了。　　第一段是欺騙。見貪人就用利誘，見孤憤的就裝同情，見倒霉的則裝慷慨，但見慷慨的却又會裝悲苦，結果是席捲了對手的東西。　　第二段是威壓。倘使這欺騙不能奏效，或者被人看穿了，那就臉孔一翻，化爲威嚇。或者說人無禮，或者誣人不端，或者賴人欠錢，或者並不說什麽綠故，而這也謂之「講道理」，結果還是席捲了對手的東西。　　第三段是溜走。用了上面的一段或兼用了兩段而成功了，就一溜烟走掉，再也尋不出踪跡來。失敗了，也是一溜烟走掉，再也尋不出踪跡亦。事情鬧得大一點，則則離開本埠，避過了風頭再出現。　　有這樣的職業，明明白白，然而人們是不以爲奇的。　　「白相」可以喫飯，勞力的自然就要餓肚，明明白白，然而人們也不以爲奇。　　但「喫白相飯」朋友倒自有其可敬的地方，因爲他還直直落落的告訴人們說，「喫白相飯的！」「藝術論」質疑  徐懋庸　　魯迅先生的譯文，據說是不容易懂的，但我近日讀他所譯的「藝術論」，對於下一節文章，是敢於自信，百分之百地懂得了的。　　這是其中所引旅行家巴敦的「東非洲諸大湖遊記」中的一節，文云；「瓦仰安提族的黑人們，經過敵對他們的種族所住的部落旁邊時，爲要不因自已的模樣，激怒他們，便不帶武器。但在自已的家裏，他們却全都武裝起來，至省，也帶着棍子。」　　「藝術論」的作者蒲列哈諾夫引了這例子，以說明達爾文所說的「對立（Ａｎｔｉ、ｔｂｅｓｏｓ）的根原，」即他自已名之曰「矛盾的衝動」的。他還加以解釋道：「瓦仰安提的黑人，在非武裝不可的時候，却解去武裝，乃是向敵人表示：我遠離了關於自衛的一切思想，我完全相信你的寛仁。」　　我之看懂這一節譯文，並非由於這節譯文特别易懂，而是因爲這節文字所說的事實，就在眼前，過於親切，所以使我恍然大悟。　　然而，我欵心魯迅先生的譯文，有幾處錯誤。所謂「非洲」，「我以爲當作」「亞洲」，「黑人」該是「黄人」，至於「瓦仰安提族」，則當意譯爲「漢族」。　　這譯本，是根據日譯本重譯的，則這錯誤之責，也許當由日譯者負之，不然，便是蒲列哈諾夫弄錯的；再不然，則是巴敦先生記錯，或有意爲「漢族」譯。　　要是再不然，那麽，難道非洲的黑人中，眞有「瓦仰安提」這一族，而且這一族與亞洲的黄人漢族，在進化的過程上，竟有什麽淵源麽？堕民  唐弢　　浙東有一種被人輕視的民族，他們的聲音笑貎，完和當地居民一樣；可是兩者的中間，郤深深地隔著一條鴻溝。　　他們呌做堕民。據堕民猥編所載，說是宋將焦光瓚的部落，因背宋降金，爲時人所不齒。明太祖定户籍的時候，匾其門曰丐户。七百餘年來，他們就在悲苦和被人輕蔑的環境下過著日子。遜淸雍正的時候，詔許堕民自新，但似乎没有甚麽效果。北伐成功，也有解放堕民運動，可是解放以後的生計問題郤没有人計及：要享受自由就得挨餓，堕民對於這番盛意，還是不敢領情。　　堕民和居民不通婚姻，除了職業的關係偶爾接觸外，在平素，他們另有著自已的世界。　　鄕村的小市鎭上，隨處都有堕民所開設的理髮店。當我居鄕的時候，每三星期終得去光顧一次；他們理髮的手術並不高妙，可是兩只耳朶郤掃得好，據說這是「支那」人的絶技，但上海理髮匠决没有他們掃得輕快。　　在婚喪宴會上服侍的人，呌做値筵，也是堕民副業的一種。他們手段靈敏，態度是謙卑：喪事上祭的時候，每獻一道祭菜就有一個姿勢，動作非常純熟。看慣上海酒菜館理侍者的人們，也許會覺得浙東的値筵是有些殷勤小心得「豈有此理」吧！　　此外抬轎和吹打，也各有其藝術。至於婦女職業在堕民的發達，更非都市裏的「現代小姐」所能夢想；她們完全像男人一樣，替婦孺們担任修面一類的工作，他們不用傢伙，只是一條綿紗線，用手和嘴牽住，緩緩地，像削草機一般在面上擦過，又簡單，又爽利，眞夠原始藝術的意味。她們的消息很是靈能通，婚喪的事終瞞不過；進門照例是一大篇吉利話，領賞的時候更要作無　的嘮叨，後者是「紳士先生」們所最痛惡的，可是在她們的面前終不好意思板起面孔。　　辱國者的子孫做堕民，賣國的漢好如果有子孫的話，至少也將是一種堕民！堕民在中國恐將「世代綿綿」的傳下去了。認錯  彭家煌　　近大馬路的河南路，那並不算寛的街道，因爲修理水道的綠故，一部份被禁止通行，在這擁擠難沓的街上通過，誰想不碰誰一下是没有準兒的。　　當一部風馳電製的淡黄色汽車突然遇　阻礙即刻停車的時候，跟在後面奔跑的一輛黄包車不及預防的車柄在汽車上撞了一下。　　穿兩服的汽車主從容的跳下車，檢查了自已那無恙的車，本不想有何動作，表示自已是怎樣一個寛懷大最的紳士，　彷　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　他不得不被告那車夫　　　　　　　　「按了喇叭，你聽見没有？」「我没有把你的車碰壞。」「碰壞不碰壞這是不管的。總而方之，你不能碰在我的車箱上。」　『我没有把你的車碰壞。』　　『我並没有說你碰壞了啊！碰壞了，還了得！丨丨你還不肯認錯嗎？好，丨丨喊巡捕，丨丨你還不肯認錯嗎？好，那末，到房裏去。』　　巡捕走來了，木棍劈開了人羣，聽了汽車主的叙述，便拆那黄包車的照會吆喝着：　『走，房裏去。』　走道邊夾難的喊出許多聲音了：　『糢糢糊糊認了錯得啦。』　『人家坐汽車，你是什麽東西！』　　『你還想跟人家到房裏打官司嗎？識相點，猪　。』　　那黄包車夫膛着目，惶惶然，不知該怎樣做　好。車上的客人跳下來走了。照會　在巡捕的　中，人要被押送到房裏去，劈觀者在　喝着，　　着，他膛着目，惶惶然。　　汽車主似乎動了一點憐憫之念，居然温和的挺身而出，以魯仲連自認：　　『我對你說，你是犯不上和我門的。祇要你肯認錯，我倒是很好說話丨丨喏，六隻角子，你拿去，算我賠償你那照會被拆去的損失。可是你不認錯那是不行的。』　　那車夫像要哭出來的樣子，祇好接着錢，屈服了：　　『好，好，謝謝你，先生，對不住，對不住！」　　於是，汽車主跳上車，車軋軋軋的虎視耽耽的往前進，那黄包車夫拉着空車頽喪的遠遠的追隨着那拆去照會的巡捕，河南路雖然流通了，但他還得向巡捕認錯，向：：：紅蘿蔔鬚  Jules　Kenaro作林取譯　　紅蘿蔔鬚的照片册　　一　　如果一個陌生人翻着雷辟克家裏的照片册，他一定免不了要吃驚的。他可以看到姐兒愛勒絲丁和大哥菲利克斯或立，或坐，或是穿得非當整齊，或是隨便裝束，或笑，或　，在富　的佈景前面拍攝的種種色色的照片。　　「還有紅蘿蔔鬚呢！」　　「我本來有着他狠小的時候照的一些片，」雷辟克家的回答，「但因爲他是那樣可愛的綠故，人家都和我搶去了，弄得我連一枚都没有留着。」而事實是從來没有人給紅蘿蔔鬚照過像。　　二　　他的諢名紅蘿蔔鬚被人呌得那樣熟了，弄得他家裏的人在喊出他那眞正的受洗　的名字之前，總得躊踷一下。　　「爲什麽你們呌他紅蘿蔔鬚呢？中；在爲他那黄色　　「他的　塊更要黄呢。」雷辟克家的回答。　　三　　還有其他特殊的標記：　　紅蘿蔔鬚的臉孔一點也不逗人愛。　　紅蘿蔔鬚的鼻子像　鼠掘成的土堆一樣凸起。　　紅蘿蔔鬚的耳朶　始終有着！些麵包皮，雖然人家常常給他挖去。　　紅蘿蔔鬚可以把　放在舌子上融掉，吃下肚子。　　紅蘿蔔鬚的脚步異常沉重，並且走路十分難看，好像怐僕一樣。　　紅蘿蔔鬚的頭根上有一層藍色的汚垢，好像戴着一個項圈似的。　　最後，紅蘿蔔鬚有一種奇怪的口味，並且他聞不出麝香。　　　四　　在一家人裏面，他起得最早，每天和女僕同時起床。冬天早晨，天還没亮他便跳下床，他以手去看時候，丨他用指尖摸着時鐘上的長短針。當咖啡和朱古律預備好了的時候，他便急急忙忙地吃着一塊不論什麽。　　　五　　當别人介紹他和什麽人會面時，他把頭轉過去，從背後伸出手來，躱躱閃閃地，兩腿　屈起來，搔弄着墻壁。　　如果人家問他：　　「你願意抱吻我嗎，紅蘿蔔鬚？」　　他回答：　　「啊！這可不必。」　　　六　　雷辟克家的丨紅蘿蔔鬚，人家對你說話時，你應當回答呀。　　紅蘿蔔鬚丨丨Ｂｏｕｉ，ｂａｎｂａｎ。（譯者按：此處原應作ｏｕｉ，ｍａｍａｎ，即「是啦，媽媽」之意，因說話人口裏吃着東西，故弄成ｂｏｕｉ，ｂａｎｂａｎ）。　雷辟克家的丨我好像已經對你說遇，小孩子說話時絶不　該　着滿嘴的東西呀。</p>

<p>談言「美棉進關本麥上山！」  賓符　　「美棉停關，雜糧上山！」這是陜甘一帶農民的歌謠，意思原是說全部的田地，都種了棉花，反使糧食没有了種植的地位，可是現在，這歌謠郤更有了另一方面的應騐了，　　一月以前渡美參加華府談話的宋子文先生，最近已向美國財政善後公司替我們借好了五千萬的美金，專門充作購買美國的棉麥之用，不久以後，美棉美麥就將源源不絶地向我國輸入，這可不使我們的「國」産的價格狂跌，甚至把産物在山上屯積起來麽？　　據說訂立借欵的理由，是爲了「中美兩國俱極有益，且可减少美國大宗過剩的物品，又可鼓勵經濟之復興間接有裨於世界之物價」，這動機自然是純潔的·這目光自然是遠大的，不過我所引爲遺憾的，在考慮上似乎欠周密，在事實上似乎欠顧全，這次借欵的訂立，在美國，大宗過剩的物品有了出路，又握得了年息五厘的債權，自然是計之得，在我國，棉紗業和麵粉業，也許能夠因此得到稍稍的發展，然而這也還在不可知之數，可是在那已瀕破産的農村加增了一重破壞力量，在那胼手胝足的農民身上罩上了一層愁雲慘霧，郤是眼前就會發生的事實，在經濟不景氣的今天，我國農産物價格的低落已達了極點，這次大宗美麥的輸入，一定將使農産物的價格狂跌到不能繼持農民的生活，否則就没有了出路面無用地屯積在山上，　　發展工商業是當今的要道，復興農村也是當今的急務，爲了部分工商業表面的發展而影響農村的凋敝而和美國訂立棉麥借欵，實不啻是飲酖止渴，而且部分的工商業的發展也還在不可知之數！　　然而，到了今天，影響農村也罷；飲酖止渴也罷；反正棉麥借欵的合同，已經簽字了。不過現在我們所希望的只要把負債借來的棉麥做到汪院長所說的「物　其用」就好了。六，一一，科舉  傑克　　「一朝金榜題名時」，接着便是一衣錦還鄉，「光宗耀祖」。在封建時代的窮措大們，下個「十年寒窗」的决心，誰也不能折定他們没有這樣的光榮　　運。　　在下生不逢時，歟世界初次見面的時候，恰遇着停科舉興學校的時候。所以在童年時代，每遇逢年過節，全家在一塊談笑時；父兄們每每談到科舉是如何的好，如何的可以提拔眞才，並且還講到科舉場中的趣事趣聞，接着便來了一聲長歎！「科舉不停，說不定我也是進士翰林了」言下不勝感慨之至！　　因爲父兄隨時灌漑着科舉的觀念，再加上看了一些悲歡離合的小說，所以常常希冀着有科舉復興的一日，那麽讀　　　　價　　　　　的漲　　　　　　各　　可以　　去　一分　。　　　每在酒後鬰鬰的當兒，口裏總是哼着「科舉不興，國將不國」這一類的牢騷，自已更覺得非實在下一番苦功不可，所以仿着古人頭懸樑，錐刺股那樣的意思，埋着頭去同四書五經古文打得火熱的　　高小已經快要畢業，什麽四書等等已經一溫再溫，然血科舉這東西，越發一天天沈靜下去，眼看着進士狀元的夢，是再也不用打主義做了。好在那時洋狀元又風行全村了，街坊鄰居都談着鄰村某某的兒子中了洋狀元，現在已經做了大官，發了大財：並且還談論到洋狀元與以前的狀元不同，中洋狀元是要到外洋說洋話，作洋文，然後才能做洋狀元呢·於是，單純平靜的腦海裏，又映上了一個洋狀元的影子·　　這已經是十年前的事，這幾年來因爲生活的追逐，奔走各處，去謀肚子的滿足，什麽進士翰林洋狀元的影子也爲着生活的鞭策，趕得乾乾淨淨。不想近來翻閱報紙，看到了敎部嚴令會考，以及某某省政府嚴令各校增加讀經的消息，不禁使人覺悟到這大槪是解决國難基本工作吧？因爲科舉所以取士，會考亦所以取士，士取而國可救，足以會考與讀經的重要可知，不過遺憾的是：然望科舉的父親已死去了：飽受科舉思想的自已，也因生活的鞭策而没有讀經！四書五經丨會考的資格了，對着會考忙讀經忙的洋洋文　，不覺使人望洋與歎，感慨　之</p>

<p>Feng Hopes Song Will First Return to Chahar to Take Responsibility for Security; The Authorities Insist Feng First Rescind His Title</p>
<p>Specific Measures Must Await Kong Xiangxi's Arrival in Beiping Before a Decision is Made</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's Representative in Beiping Negotiates Troop Departure Procedures</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning at 10:00 AM, Song Zheyuan invited Deng Zhexi, Qin Dechun, Zhang Jiyong, and others to discuss the situation in Chahar. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 PM. This afternoon, Deng visited He and Huang, providing a detailed report on Feng's intentions. Feng urgently hopes that Song will lead his troops back to Chahar and that the authorities will accept his four conditions. Feng has indicated that if Song returns to Chahar, all problems will be resolved. At the same time, he also stated that leading troops to recover the lost territory in eastern Chahar would be inconsistent. Therefore, the authorities are studying how to accept this proposal. However, both sides aim for a peaceful resolution, and a peaceful solution is expected. If Song is unable to return to his post ahead of schedule, Qin Dechun may return to Chahar first to take responsibility on Song's behalf and maintain security in Chahar Province during the transitional period. Once the situation in Chahar stabilizes, Song will then return to Chahar to take charge of everything. Feng's representative, Liu Zhizhou, returned to Zhang after completing his mission, and Huang's representative, Ma Boyuan, also went to meet with Feng. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The focus of the situation in Chahar is that Feng hopes to be able to rescind the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army only after Song returns to Chahar, to avoid a situation where no one is responsible before Song returns. The authorities insist that Feng first rescind his title and then order Song to return to Chahar. Song will send a responsible representative, Qin Dechun, to make a final effort to communicate with Feng. It is rumored that Xiong Bin, the chief advisor to the Military Affairs Committee, intends to go to Chahar to persuade Feng. The specific resolution method must await Kong Xiangxi's arrival in Beiping, after which Kong, Deng, and Song will negotiate a decision in Beiping. Song and Qin are scheduled to visit Huang and He tonight to discuss the situation. Due to the improved situation in Chahar, Song's willingness to return to Chahar is stronger than before. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangjiakou reported that after Feng appointed Ji Hongchang as the commander-in-chief of the Northern Route Front, Ji immediately led his troops to Zhangbei. Feng has reassigned the position of Commander of the Chahar Provincial Garrison, which Ji left vacant, to Chief of Staff Cui Maicheng as acting commander. Cui has accepted the order and has now taken office. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Guitang's representative, Shang Wu, arrived in Zhangbei County on the 23rd to visit Ji and hold discussions. After completing the mission, he returned to Guyuan on the same day to report to Liu. Zhao Chengshou's troops are still stationed in the southwest of Zhangbei and near Qian. The righteous troops of Deng Wen and Li Zhongyi have been ordered by Feng to advance from Wanquan County to the Kangbao area. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's representative, Hu Jiesan, separately visited Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, and others this afternoon to negotiate the departure procedures for the 41st Army. Sun has already drafted the departure routes, moving along the Shacheng and Jincheng roads. It has been decided to first implement a reduction of the old and weak, sending them back to their hometowns, and only the strong and capable will go. After the departure, military stations will be set up in Baotou, Wuyuan, and Ningxia. For transportation convenience, the army has ordered 50 cars from the Tianjin Lihe Foreign Firm, which are expected to be delivered in mid-next month. The location for the office of the Tuntian Supervisory Office has not yet been determined. Sun plans to actively develop local industries after arriving in Qinghai. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>The Puppet State Establishes a National Highway Construction Office</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Shenyang dispatch, Li Zirong's righteous army, consisting of 40 men, recently advanced from Huanren towards Xinbin, reaching the vicinity of Yongling, Heinengjiang, and Nianzishan. At the Wujianfang location, 500 righteous soldiers engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese garrison at Nianzishan on the 22nd, resulting in the death of 17 enemy soldiers, including a soldier named Xiaoxiaochai. The puppet state of Manchukuo has established a National Highway Construction Office to build automobile roads in various provinces. The planned roads include: 1. Between Fengtian and Fushun; 2. Between Lixi and Hunan Zamu; 3. Between Shanchengzhen and Liuhe; 4. Between Beipiao and Chengde; 5. Between Fengtian and Linjiang; 6. Between Nahe, Nenjiang, and Daheihe; 7. Between Keshan, Mingshui, and Anda Station; 8. Between Qiqihar, Fuyu, Yian, and Baiquan; 9. Between Zhaochuan, Zhaodong, Haigou, and Lanxi, to serve the transportation of goods and military purposes to the Songhua River basin; 10. Along the Songhua River basin, between Hulan, Bayan, Mulan, and Tonghe Chunqiu, as a commercial and military transportation line; 11. The area between the Yuzaike and Huhai lines. It is planned that after the autumn harvest, with Baiquan as the center, from Mingshui in the south to Keshan in the north, and from Hailun in the east to Yian in the west, automobile transportation will be carried out. This plan is currently under consideration. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Satisfactory Negotiations with Various Southwest Commissioners</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Ying and Duan Xipeng went to Hong Kong on the 19th of this month to explain the truce in North China and the details of the Sino-American loan. After arriving in Hong Kong, Shi and Duan met with Hu Hanmin, Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Li Zongren, and others. According to reports, they stayed in Hong Kong for one and a half days before returning north. This morning at 8:00 AM, they arrived in Nanjing by train and visited Wang at noon to report the results of their trip. Shi told reporters that after the Tanggu Truce was signed and the Sino-American loan was established, the Southwest region, due to a failure to understand the government's difficult situation, expressed various misunderstandings. Newspapers published these misunderstandings, providing the enemy with ammunition. Duan and I, on orders from President Wang, went to Hong Kong to explain everything. During our one and a half days in Hong Kong, we met with Hu Hanmin, Li Renchao, Chen Zhenru, Li Delin, and Minister Huang Jikuan. After meeting, everyone frankly and sincerely exchanged views. I believe that while the gentlemen in the Southwest have misunderstandings about the central government's measures, they are not as serious as rumored. After detailed explanations, much understanding was gained. It is undeniable that the signing of the North China truce agreement was not satisfactory to all parties. However, the central government is also heartbroken. Circumstances and facts forced us to do this. It can be described as an alliance under duress, but fortunately, there is no agreement that sacrifices sovereignty or humiliates the nation. If we fairly discuss the matter, what would happen if we were in the same situation? Regarding the Sino-American loan, the Southwest</p>
<h3 id="e4">Reportedly, Both Sides Have Reached an Understanding on the Issue of Disposing of the Pseudo-Army in Eastern Hebei <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army Arrived in Tanggu to Discuss with Qian Zongze</p>
<p>The Military and Political Committees of Beiping Have Appointed Representatives to Negotiate with the Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of disposing of the pseudo-army in eastern Hebei has been repeatedly negotiated between our side and the Japanese side, and both sides have reached a further understanding. Several representatives of the Japanese Kwantung Army have arrived in Tanggu and are staying on Japanese warships. Representative Qian Zongze has met with the Japanese representatives once and reported the situation to He. After discussions between Huang and He, it was decided that the Military and Political Committees would send representatives to negotiate with the Japanese side in accordance with the agreement. Our representatives have been appointed as Qian Zongze and Tao Qian from the Military Affairs Committee, and Yin Rugeng, Li Zeyi, Lei Jirong, etc. from the Political Committee. They will go to Tianjin immediately to negotiate with the representatives of the Japanese Kwantung Army and Commander Nakamura on the post-disposition of the pseudo-army, the takeover of the war zone, and the opening of the Beining Railway. A solution is expected after this negotiation. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Lutai, several dozens of pseudo-soldiers fired dozens of shots at our side in the Dongdawan Village area of Lutai last night. We did not return fire and they retreated soon after. More than 20 Japanese soldiers were originally stationed in Jiangwakou, northeast of Ninghe, but retreated eastward again yesterday afternoon. The whereabouts of the Japanese soldiers stationed in Fengtai Town, who retreated eastward yesterday, are unknown. According to a telegram from Tongzhou, this morning at 8:00 AM, County Chief Cai of Sanhe County was escorted back to his original post in Sanhe by a team sent by Tongxian County. A phone call from Shunyi reported that there was an interruption due to heavy rain last night. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mutō recently convened a meeting of division and brigade commanders in Changchun to decide on the issue of disposing of the pseudo-army. The Japanese military plans to transfer the reorganized pseudo-army in Guanwai into Guannei, stationing them in the area of the Luan River. A large number of pseudo-soldiers have entered the Jiukou area, and the number of pseudo-soldiers in Guannei has increased to more than 30,000. Hao Peng, Shi Yousan, and others have been very active in Tangshan and Qinhuangdao recently. The Kwantung Army plans to send Colonel Kita and several representatives from the South Manchuria Railway to Tanggu to negotiate with our side on the disposal of the pseudo-army at any time. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>The Southwest believed that the central government had ulterior motives and even accused it of using the loan to deal with internal wars. The separation was not insignificant. We explained the central government's intentions in detail, stating that the government has always adhered to the belief of jointly overcoming national difficulties in the face of the national crisis. We only hope that the local governments will understand the central government's painstaking efforts, strive for local construction, and work together with a unified goal. Although the paths may be different, they will eventually lead to the same destination. In the midst of turmoil and displacement, we may be able to find a way to save the country. As for the cotton and wheat loan, the central government has determined its use for revitalizing industries and relieving rural areas and will not use it for any consumption purposes. It also plans to invite representatives from all parties to form a committee to strictly supervise its use. Mr. Hu and others said that they absolutely agree with anything that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Other matters, such as the previous talk of forming a separate government in the Southwest, were also discussed. In today's environment in our country, this kind of action is enough to destroy the country. The survival of the nation is only tied to a thread of vitality. Anyone who destroys this thread of vitality will undoubtedly perish. Therefore, in all foreign affairs, whether military, diplomatic, or speeches, the nation must be the prerequisite and be consistent. In short, our trip can be called close. When we were about to depart, we received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, detailing the need for internal unity. Mr. Hu and others all expressed their agreement. We have already replied to Chiang with a telegram yesterday, reporting on the progress of our trip. If necessary, we may go to Jiangxi. Shi also strongly denied the news that Chen Mingshu was in charge of Guangdong, saying that it was a rumor spread by those who were trying to sow discord and provoke trouble. During our trip, we did not touch on any personnel issues. Minister Huang Shaoxiong is in Hong Kong and intends to return to Guangxi, but the date of his return to Nanjing is still undetermined.

<p>The Five Qingdao Warships Sailed to Weihaiwei, Issued an Ultimatum to Shen Honglie; Shen Has Prepared to Resign to the Central Government</p>
<p>He Yingqin Will Send Xu Zushan to Qingdao to Mediate</p>
<p>(Beiping) The five Qingdao warships have all sailed to Weihaiwei. He Yingqin will send Xu Zushan to Qingdao to mediate with the navy. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Zushan, the administrative commissioner of Weihaiwei, came to Beiping to report to He on the management of Weihaiwei, and also briefly reported on the Qingdao naval incident. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Qingdao) The defection of the Northeast Fleet from Qingdao, triggered by the assassination attempt on Shen Honglie, shows signs of worsening. The defecting fleet has reported to the Nanjing government and issued an ultimatum to Shen Honglie, demanding a response within 24 hours. The conditions are: 1. Shen Honglie should step down immediately; 2. The Northeast Fleet should be handed over to former Chief of Staff Ling Xiao; 3. Two suspected officers who sniped at Shen Honglie should be released immediately; 4. Three months of back pay should be paid immediately. It is believed that the Northeast Fleet, which defected for the purpose of ousting Shen Honglie, was instigated by a small number of officers while all officers above the rank of school officer were ashore. With little coal loaded, it is unlikely that they can escape to Nanjing. Shen Honglie plans to wait for the representatives of the rebels to come to Qingdao and negotiate with them. It is rumored that the incident was orchestrated by former Qingdao Mayor Ge Jingen, who colluded with Qingdao financiers to overthrow the mayor. If Shen's flank, the Marine Corps, wavers, the situation will be even more unfavorable to Shen. Xie Gangzhe, the chief of staff of the Northeast Fleet, acting as commander yesterday, convened a meeting and decided to give all the people from Hubei in the fleet, who have a relationship with Shen Honglie as fellow villagers, a one-month allowance and order them to leave the ship. With things having come to this, it will be difficult for Shen Honglie to stay. Today, he will send a telegram to the central government and the Beiping Military Affairs Committee to resign from his posts as commander of the Northeast Fleet and mayor of Qingdao. It is feared that the central government will not retain him. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>

Three to four hundred representatives from all walks of life attended. Secretary Zhou Zhensheng was responsible for handing over the seal. Yu sent Chen Bulou, Tao Zhunian, and others to take over the affairs of various departments. The former department chiefs did not attend. New personnel have not yet been appointed. In his speech after taking office, Yu said that his motive for concurrently serving as mayor dates back to the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe. At that time, he firmly declined the offer because he was busy with the affairs of the provincial government's military headquarters. Later, Tianjin was once in danger and the local situation was increasingly precarious. If it is not rectified at this time, it will be even more difficult in the future. According to Yu's observation, all cities have made significant progress in construction, except for Tianjin. Although this has been affected by the turmoil, it is undeniable that general municipal administration has been stagnant for many years, which is a well-known fact. The former Mayor Zhou has also paid attention to this, but all undertakings require魄力 (vigour and boldness) to be successful. Yu once said that not only should individuals not be corrupt, but also that all laissez-faire and inertia can lead to degeneration. Integrity is good, but integrity without understanding is the same as废 (waste). Based on this reason, Yu will absolutely make the city's finances public to correct the弊 (malady) of "integrity without understanding". The city's annual income is more than 4 million, but the deficit is more than 500,000. With such a large sum of money, roads and sanitation are nearing suspension, almost bankrupt. If rectification is not carried out at this time, the consequences will be unthinkable. Yu has no absolute confidence in the future of municipal administration, but now that he has concurrently assumed the position of mayor, he cannot abandon any responsibility. He can only strive to rectify and move forward. Yu will not talk about the policy direction today but will do his best to exert every ounce of strength and move forward bravely. He hopes that his colleagues in the city will be as one with him, united in virtue and working hard to move forward. According to Yu's observation, there may be a way to manage the future municipal administration, but it lies in everyone's avoiding inertia and eliminating the bad habits of government offices. If everything is not corrected, Yu will never believe it. He hopes that his colleagues will work hard and that all sectors will provide guidance and correction so that municipal administration will improve day by day. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Hankou) The leak in the Zhoujia Ju Dike in Wuchang became increasingly severe on the 28th, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Xi Dejiong personally led civilians to carry out rescue efforts and build a transverse dike as a second line of defense. The leak at the foot of the Baishazhou Dike was also critical, and the Flood Control Association carried out rescue efforts. It was still not out of danger by evening. In addition, the Haikou Dike in Yangxin collapsed, and the Fankou Dike was also in danger. The Provincial Party Department sent a letter to the headquarters and the Economic Commission on the 28th, stating that the personnel of the Jinshui Dike Engineering Office were negligent in their dike work and treated human lives as a child's play, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe. It requested a thorough investigation and severe punishment. The provincial government ordered County Chief Deng Bing to carry out dike repair in Hanyangxin Heshui, and to investigate and report on the incident and the damage. Warnings were also issued separately to the other 19 dike sections to indicate rescue measures. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level of the Han River remained unchanged on the 28th. The upstream Chongqing rose 4 feet 9 inches, Changsha rose 5 feet 2 inches, and Yuezhou Shashi was stable. The entire Municipal Party Committee inspected the Zhanggong Dike on the 28th at noon. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Xiangxian, the chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Committee, flew to Xunyang by China Aviation aircraft at 3:30 PM on the 28th, and is expected to arrive around 6:00 PM. Song Xishang, the director of the Engineering Office of the committee, and various technical personnel will take a boat to Xunyang on the morning of the 29th and immediately begin flood control work. (Central News Agency telegram on the 29th and 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Transportation's Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Committee released the following water level reports for various locations along the Yangtze River on the 28th: Upstream: Chongqing 31.7 feet, 1.3 feet lower than the 27th; Yichang 26.6 feet, 1.7 feet lower than the 27th. Midstream: Shashi 22.6 feet, 1.9 feet lower than the 27th; Yuezhou 47.5 feet, 0.6 feet lower than the 27th; Hankou 47.2 feet, same as the 27th. Downstream: Jiujiang 44.3 feet, same as the 27th; Anqing 38.4 feet, 0.3 feet higher than the 27th; Wuhu 27.5 feet, 0.3 feet higher than the 27th; Nanjing 21.7 feet, 0.2 feet higher than the 27th; Zhenjiang 18.4 feet, 0.2 feet higher than the 27th. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Commission received a telegram from Zhu Jiuying and others on the 28th stating that they departed from Hankou to conduct an inspection downstream. On the 27th, they arrived in Jiujiang. Huangshigang and Wuxue were flooded by several feet of water. Fortunately, the main dikes along the river are higher than the water surface, with at least five or six feet remaining. In recent days, the upstream water has receded. The commission also received a telegram from Shi Dubai reporting that the water in Chongqing, Yichang, Shashi, and Yuezhou is receding. The current water level in Hankou exceeds the level on the same day in 1931 by three feet. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level of the Han River remained at 47 feet 2 inches on the 28th, with no rise or fall. According to Yang Silian, director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the Han River can recede in four days. The reasons why it cannot flow freely eastward are threefold: 1. The rainfall along the coast has been excessive in recent days, and the high tide has caused the tide to flow back into the inner river. 2. The water level in the Poyang Lake area downstream has surged, making it unable to accommodate the flow. 3. The river channel from Hankou to Huangshigang and other places along the Yangtze River has become increasingly higher. In Chongqing, the water level on the 28th was 32 feet 1 inch, a decrease of 6 feet from the 27th. Yichang was 26 feet 6 inches, a decrease of 2 feet. Shashi was 22 feet, a decrease of 9 inches. Yuezhou was 47 feet 5 inches, a decrease of 6 inches. Changsha was 42 feet 9 inches, a decrease of 6 inches. Since the upstream is stable and receding, the Han River is bound to fall greatly within two or three days. (Central News Agency telegram on the 28th)</p>

<p>The Municipal Works Bureau is Trying to Block the Breaches; The Water Level of the Qinhuai River Has Risen Again</p>
<p>In Nanjing, the area around Baota Bridge in Xiaguan, which is the boundary between Nanjing City and Jiangning County, has a dike along the grain transport river connecting to the Yangtze River. Due to continuous attacks by the rapid currents of the river, the soil is loosening and collapsing. Several round holes with a diameter of one foot were discovered early on the 28th, and river water poured in like a tide. Nearby residents moved away. Fortunately, there was no strong wind, and there was no breach. If the breaches are not blocked quickly, collapse is imminent. The Municipal Works Bureau and the Jiangning County Government agreed to use burlap sacks to block the breaches, and at the same time, to set up wooden stakes to prevent the dike from loosening and collapsing. The railway for transporting mud along the Yangtze River in Xiaguan has been completed today. Workers were ordered to transport mud and raise the soil dike tonight and it is expected to be completed in two days. The cement dike has been contracted to the China-Philippines Company, which has been strictly ordered to complete it immediately. The company is scheduled to start work on the 29th and must complete it within five days. The temporary dike adjacent to the Chengping Wharf and the naval sports ground has now been built. In order to maintain current traffic, a breach remains, which will be completely blocked if necessary. After the Qinhuai River was closed off to the east and west, the water level did not increase. It rained day and night the day before, and the water level rose again. The Municipal Works Bureau has set up six water pumps in Dongguan and two in Xiguan. The official announced that it has rented two water pumps from the Zhendan Machinery Factory, and that it has pumped out two feet, but the embankments along the river clearly prove that it has not fallen, and has risen several inches, but not significantly. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>The water level in Xiaguan, Nanjing was 21.7 feet on the 28th, an increase of two inches compared to yesterday. The soil dikes that collapsed in Zhangjiaxu and Jiujiaxu yesterday have been filled with soil in burlap sacks. However, hundreds of shantytowns in Jiujiaxu, Meifu Street, and Baoshan Street have been flooded one after another. The depths have reached over the head or shoulder level in the deep areas. The Municipal Works Bureau is rushing to prepare for relief and is collecting burlap sacks to provide protection at any time. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>The Nanjing Relief Committee, in view of the continuous years of drought in various provinces and the increasing water levels along the river this summer, fears that another major disaster like the one twenty years ago will occur. It has sent a circular telegram to the provincial governments along the river, instructing the responsible personnel to take careful precautions. The committee is also hoping to clarify the extent of the disaster and the relief efforts for the counties that have already been affected. It is hoped that these measures will be planned in advance to avoid being caught off guard. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Summer Vacation Admonition to the Youth <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Now, the scorching summer days are upon us again. In the recent period, all levels of schools across the country will have a relatively long vacation.</p>
<p>Naturally, perhaps many are planning, "Should I go to Lushan or Mogan Mountain during the summer vacation?" Perhaps many are rejoicing, "Students should have such a rest during the vacation. The weather is so hot." But we believe that ordinary, impoverished youth have no chance to rest. And those thoughtful young people have no leisure to escape the summer heat. Only those well-fed, well-housed young ladies and young masters who are idle have the ability to rest and escape the summer heat with peace of mind. However, we believe that this class of people dancing on the volcano simply cannot survive in the present era, especially in China, which is currently undergoing a difficult process.</p>
<p>I still remember that during last year's summer vacation, this newspaper held a summer essay contest entitled "Summer Work Plan and Work Report." At the same time, an article entitled "How Should Young People Utilize the Summer Vacation?" was published, the gist of which was, "The country has reached the line between life and death. We can only lie on firewood and taste gall, and study hard to cultivate the strength to struggle. It would be a great pity if the two months of vacation were wasted." This essay contest actually yielded good results. Many young people sent meticulous work plans from various places, followed by reports on their work in practice. This can prove that many young people are unwilling to waste this long vacation and the precious time.</p>
<p>From last year to this year, the national crisis has not diminished at all, but has become increasingly serious. The facts have already proven that the world is increasingly turbulent, and China is especially becoming more difficult. Living in this era of storms, can every one of us Chinese people, especially every student and youth, still be indifferent and complacent, seeking only temporary peace?</p>
<p>We believe that, from the perspective of national significance, the youth of today should earnestly grasp this turbulent era. They should grasp what the youth should do in this turbulent era. If we say that the youth of today should save the country and the nation, then how exactly should they start, and what is the true meaning of saving the country and the nation? These are issues that young people should deeply consider in advance, and they should earnestly take on their own mission in a planned way, so that this precious time is not wasted.</p>
<p>From a personal standpoint, Mr. Gu Tinglin said it well: "For a person who studies, if they do not advance every day, they will regress every day." This unbroken time cannot be interrupted by two months of vacation. Therefore, for the sake of personal academic achievement, young people must also utilize their summer vacation and not waste the great time on emptiness.</p>
<p>China's lifeline depends entirely on the hundreds of thousands of young people of today. We sincerely hope with boundless enthusiasm that the youth of today can all work hard to encourage themselves and strive for their own mission, and not turn themselves into young ladies and young masters, becoming useless waste in this era of storms.</p>

<p>Claims He Will Refuse to Discuss War Debts at Economic Conference</p>
<p>His Mission Is Only to Relay Messages to the Delegation</p>
<p>Estonia's Abandonment of the Gold Standard Shocks All of Europe</p>
<p>Various Parties Hope the United States Will Take Action to Stabilize</p>
<p>London: Professor Morley arrived in London this morning at 1:00 AM. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Professor Morley, who has been long awaited by representatives from various countries at the London Economic Conference, arrived in Plymouth today. Contrary to initial expectations, he did not fly to London via Ireland. Morley told reporters that the war debt issue would not be discussed at the conference and would be discussed in Washington at a later date. He also stated that he would only stay in London for a week and his mission was to inform the American delegation of the recent developments in the United States. Then, he will return to Washington to report the conference situation in detail to President Roosevelt. Today's remarks are enough to dispel rumors that Professor Morley will replace Hull as the representative of the United States at the Economic Conference. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Renol States U.S. Tariff Policy <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Two Parties at Home Have Different Political Views</p>
<p>Congress Will Definitely Back the President</p>
<p>London: Renol, the U.S. representative to the World Economic Conference, spoke to the Economic Committee today. First, he discussed the different political views of the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States. Then, he spoke about the victory of the Democratic Party last November and the tariff policies it advocates. He said, "I am sure that any agreement reached by the Economic Conference that is approved by President Roosevelt will be approved by both houses of the U.S. Congress, because both houses are behind the U.S. President." Reeve spoke about the remarks made recently by Dr. Sterky of Switzerland, saying that he was not familiar with French, so he only understood a few sentences of Dr. Sterky's remarks. It seemed that Dr. Sterky criticized the U.S. tariff act of 1930. It should be known that the U.S. Republican Party has always advocated the principle of protective tariffs, while the Democratic Party advocates tariff reductions. The Democratic Party opposed the 1930 tariff act, but the Republican Party was in power at that time, so the bill was passed. Now, the U.S. President wants to propose a bill to Congress that would allow the President to reduce tariffs through multilateral or bilateral agreements. He knows that if this bill had been proposed earlier, Congress would have passed it long ago, but it was necessary to postpone the congressional session. He does not approve of high tariffs and quotas because they prevent the rational flow of international trade. Newspapers now accuse the United States of adopting nationalism. If nationalism refers to streamlining domestic affairs, increasing purchasing power, and restoring prosperity, then we Americans dare to plead guilty. We Americans are now adopting a policy in order to pull our country out of the economic depression. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Estonia Abandons Gold Standard</p>
<h3 id="e14">Gold Standard Countries Organize Defense Alliance to Avoid Overall Financial Collapse <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Monetary Group Agrees to Rebuild International Gold Standard</p>
<p>Hull Deliberately Turns a Deaf Ear to Stabilization of Gold Currency</p>
<p>Rievel, the Estonian Parliament, held an all-night meeting until this morning and decided by a majority of two votes to abandon the gold standard. Now, the Estonian crown is at the same level as the Swedish krona. This case will have a significant impact on the small Baltic states that still use the gold standard. The intensity of the debate in the parliament was rare, so the result of the vote barely passed by 47 to 45 votes. The content authorizes the National Bank to depreciate the currency value to the same level as the Swedish krona, that is, to depreciate the original value by 35%. After the financial situation improves, the currency restrictions will be gradually lifted. According to this intention, it is to restore Estonia's foreign trade, which is the only way to avoid a cabinet crisis. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>London: After Estonia abandoned the gold standard today, financial circles here are deeply concerned that the remaining gold standard countries will also be forced to follow suit one by one within three days. Representatives of the gold standard countries, seeing the increasingly critical financial situation, are now doing their best to try to save the situation in order to avoid the total collapse of the gold standard. The Monetary Group Committee, which is discussing the reconstruction of the international monetary standard, is also taking steps to deal with the situation. At a public meeting from 11:00 AM to 1:30 PM today, a resolution was unanimously passed to stop the domestic circulation of gold and concentrate it in the central bank. At the same time, the legal gold reserve limit was reduced to 25% so that the gold standard could still be maintained in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, representatives of the central banks of the gold standard countries also held a secret meeting in the committee's meeting room, doing their best to organize a gold standard defense alliance. Representatives of the Bank of France also visited Mr. Zhuman, the president of the Bank of England, to discuss this matter.</p>
<p>It was recently heard that at a secret meeting of bankers from gold standard countries yesterday afternoon, the European Camp personally implored U.S. Secretary of State Hull to do his best to help take action on the immediate stabilization of gold currency. Hull replied that this matter was beyond the power of the delegation and he could not help. Those who attended the secret meeting that day included French Finance Minister Pom-Lei, Prime Minister Corijn of the Netherlands, and representatives from Switzerland and Italy, one person each. Germany did not participate. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Finance Minister Chamberlain were both invited to attend the meeting. Then, U.S. Secretary of State Hull was also invited to participate in the discussion. Representatives from gold standard countries all spoke earnestly to the British and American leaders about the worrying situation, claiming that if the Netherlands was forced to abandon the gold standard, all countries would inevitably follow in the footsteps of the Netherlands. Dutch Prime Minister Corijn would rather resign as Prime Minister than abandon the gold standard. French Finance Minister Pom-Lei said that if France was forced to abandon the gold standard, it would cause serious social and political turmoil. Therefore, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Finance Minister Chamberlain also joined the European representatives to urge U.S. Secretary of State Hull to take action on the security issue. After Hull told them that he could not help, the gold standard countries were deeply disappointed and are now hoping that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Morley can negotiate a temporary stabilization agreement, as he is recognized as a think tank of the U.S. President and is not joining the delegation, but is carrying the U.S. President's instructions. The news that Estonia abandoned the gold standard has shocked all the representatives, who are deeply afraid that Latvia, Lithuania, and Danzig will soon follow Estonia one by one. At that time, the situation in Poland will become more tense, and it will be even more difficult for France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Switzerland to maintain the gold standard. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>London: Although Trippe, the president of the Dutch National Bank, who is currently attending the World Economic Conference in London, firmly stated that the Netherlands intends to do its best to maintain the gold standard, London newspapers fear that the Dutch currency will fall and affect the currencies of other countries, causing the entire European monetary system to collapse. The Financial Times said that it is incredible that the World Economic Conference, which aims to stabilize currency and eliminate trade barriers, has actually promoted currency inflation.</p>

<p>Praises Erupt Among the People</p>
<p>New York: Currently, cotton prices have risen to the highest level in the past two years, and wheat has also risen to a price that is considered to guarantee the prosperity of rural farmers. The operations of steel mills and the automobile industry are also on par with what they were two years ago. Therefore, the commercial prosperity under President Roosevelt's currency inflation is now progressing smoothly. Today, the general public in the United States is singing the song "Happy Times Have Arrived Again." However, whether this upward trend can last is what everyone wants to know. The speculative nature of today's booming market has caused anxiety in some quarters, but the U.S. government seems to be aware of this danger and is eager to force employers to increase wages to suit the gradually increasing cost of living.

<p>Department of Agriculture today ordered that a handling fee of three cents per bushel be levied on all wheat sent to flour mills, starting at midnight on July 8. The levy will be stopped several months later when wheat prices can be maintained at 89 cents. The tax revenue will be used to subsidize those who reduce the number of acres planted with wheat. It is estimated that about 150 million yuan can be collected from this year's wheat harvest. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>on guiding farmers to destroy some of the cotton seedlings have been quite successful. The Department of Agriculture now hopes that 11,732,000 acres can be reduced this year. According to reports from various places, although cotton prices have risen, farmers are still quick to obey. If the number of acres reduced this year can reach what the Department of Agriculture hopes for at this time, then this year's cotton harvest should be 30% less than in 1931.

<p>the planting of cotton, the U.S. Department of Agriculture today began meetings with sugar producers from the United States, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Honolulu, in an attempt to reduce the planting area and ask them to assist the government in creating a major plan to raise sugar prices. However, representatives of U.S. sugar producers advocated levying full taxes on Cuban sugar and strictly restricting the import of Philippine sugar, and were unwilling to reduce the planting area in their own country and Honolulu. However, under the current circumstances, if the excess sugar is to be sold off and the sugar industry is to be restored to prosperity, the sugar planting acreage must be reduced uniformly in the United States and Honolulu. According to the Agricultural Relief Act, sugar is also listed as a basic commodity, and cotton producers can also receive some benefits as well as those who plant cotton and wheat. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has proposed that sugar producers in the United States and Honolulu should reduce planting area together with Cuba and Puerto Rico. However, U.S. sugar producers are unwilling to reduce their own planting area and want to restrict the import of other sugar. Therefore, representatives from U.S. sugar producer groups and refining groups today elected a committee to draft a plan for submission to the Department of Agriculture for consideration.

According to the plan predetermined by the British Prime Minister, this kind of matter should begin within this week. Furthermore, the expert subcommittee on currency issues has today completed its discussion on the issue of cash circulation and the legal minimum limit of gold reserves in various central banks. Mr. Failsay, the president of the International Clearing Bank, has been ordered by the subcommittee to present the following methods to the Monetary Committee tomorrow: 1. The current gold reserves should be withdrawn from domestic circulation and used exclusively for the payment of international debts. 2. The regulations for the legal gold reserves of banks issuing banknotes should be given greater flexibility, and the rate of 25% of the reserve to issue banknotes and the fact that the loan is not excessively increased can be considered sufficient.

<h3 id="e23">Britain Proposes Resolution to Reorganize Debt Issue <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British delegation this morning submitted a resolution to the drafting committee established in the Economic Committee responsible for studying methods of financial reorganization. The content first acknowledges that the recovery of world commerce depends entirely on the recovery of international loans. The second point is that under the current difficult circumstances, the recovery of international loans is unlikely. According to the British plan, the credit of various debtor countries must be preserved, as it is the first condition for the recovery of international loans. The British proposal continues to say that the various debtor countries are admirable for continuing to fulfill their obligations despite encountering various difficulties. The proposal also states that creditor countries should remove obstacles to allow the free flow of goods, so that the credit of various debtor countries can be preserved and there is no need to worry about the loans made by the creditor countries themselves. The British proposal also states that the rise in world prices is naturally beneficial to various debtor countries. However, before the changes in world prices become clear, we should not hope for a lasting reform of commercial debts. What we should do is only to establish a temporary compromise between creditor countries and debtor countries, and the method should be determined according to the surrounding circumstances of each debt, and should not be rigid. The British proposal finally proposes that an organization be formed by representatives of various foreign bondholders. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Wheat Production Adjustment Issue <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Opinions of Representatives from Four Countries are Complex</p>
<p>Still Far From Reaching an Agreement</p>
<p>(London) This year's U.S. wheat harvest is expected to be unusually poor due to extreme heat and wind and rain. Therefore, wheat prices have been soaring in recent days, affecting the Economic Conference. Just as representatives from the United States, Argentina, Canada, and Australia were discussing plans to reduce wheat planting area using domestic political programs today, a telegram was received from Chicago that wheat prices had exceeded the gold currency line, which had not been seen for many years. This led to the interruption of the meeting of the four representatives. The Argentine representative stated that restricting the acreage would provoke resistance from farmers at a time when they are hoping for prosperity. When wheat prices are sold for half a dollar per bushel, it is appropriate to reduce the acreage. If it rises to one dollar, another problem will arise. However, the Australian representative is still fully willing to join the agreement to reduce the planting area. The Canadian and American representatives also feel that it is still necessary to implement the acreage reduction movement in order to prevent excessive production in the coming year. The U.S. representative also stated that the U.S. President is still determined to carry out this plan, believing that the impact of one poor harvest is limited and that it is difficult to benefit for a long time. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>London: The adjustment of wheat production has become a complex issue in the World Economic Conference. The afternoon meeting today continued to discuss this matter. It is believed that the Australian representative, Bruce, has received a telegram from his government, but the content is unknown. It was heard that Mr. Bruce refused to reduce the number of acres of wheat fields at the meeting this morning. At that time, a certain U.S. representative stood up and said that if this matter could not be agreed upon, the United States and Canada would sell about 530 million bushels of excess wheat on the market. Mr. Bruce telegraphed Canberra to ask for new instructions. Currently, the price of wheat in New York has exceeded one dollar. This price means that the provisions of the U.S. Farm Bill to reduce the number of acres of wheat fields will begin to be implemented. This matter has made the conference situation more complicated. The opinion of U.S. observers is that this price is not natural, but it is generally believed that if this price persists, the provisions of the Farm Bill must begin to be implemented.</p>

<p>Subcommittee Drafts Report</p>
<p>Cuban Sugar Proposal Submitted for Discussion</p>
<p>Today's discussion focused on comprehensive planning of production and consumption issues, rather than simply reducing production. Regarding this section, sugar is the first item discussed by the subcommittee. The subcommittee drafted a comprehensive report, advocating that for all major items currently in surplus, both production and sales must be taken into account. All representatives at the meeting agreed that any new plan must obtain the consent of the majority of producers and the willing cooperation of importing countries in order to be effective. All representatives also agreed to the suggestion made by the Dutch representative to organize a special committee of representatives from major sugar producing countries to study the Cuban sugar proposal. Dr. Walter, the German representative, said that the Cuban proposal advocates a ten-year agreement, and he suggested that the term of the agreement should be reduced to three or five years. However, the speakers from the Netherlands, Poland, Peru, and Portugal all agreed to the Cuban plan. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London: The subcommittee of the Economic Committee of the World Economic Conference, which is discussing production and sales, has established a new draft, stipulating the necessary conditions for the reorganization plan: 1. So-called production should include excess production and inventory. 2. Compromises should include joint production and substitutes. 3. The scope of producing countries should be as broad as possible, that is, all exporting countries should be universally involved, and then non-exporting countries with extremely large production should also be sought to join. 4. Fairness should be sought for producers and consumers, and the cooperation of consumers should be sought as much as possible. 5. The implementation period should be sufficiently long. 6. All relevant countries should be able to implement it. 7. Reorganization plans should be able to adapt to the increase in demand. 8. Reorganization plans should also take into account the internal incentives for countries to clarify production. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>Newspapers and Magazines Carry Anti-British Remarks</p>
<p>Tokyo: Recently, a so-called East Asian Youth Group has been widely distributing various leaflets containing slogans such as "Japan is the savior of 350 million Indians" and "Britain is the enemy of mankind." Among them, there is also a song to punish Britain, which briefly states "Resist Britain as a punishment, Britain is the enemy of justice, the enemy of humanity, the enemy of peace, long live the Empire of Japan." These leaflets are all in Japanese. Among them, the cancellation of the Japan-India Commercial Treaty is particularly criticized, saying that India's cancellation of the treaty was not intentional, but was actually under British pressure. They also said that Britain is plotting to destroy the trade ties between Japan and India and is simultaneously declaring economic war on Japan and the people of the East. At present, the slogans posted in various streets in Japan and the magazines and publications issued all have an anti-British attitude. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, which is published with 2 million copies daily, has recently published many remarks by a certain Indian exile residing in Japan, and has published the remarks of the exile and his friends in large letters, saying how to do it. The English department of the newspaper recently published a special issue dedicated to attacking various facts of Britain's anti-Japanese actions. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<p>Liu Guitang telegraphed from Beijing on the 26th, stating: "To all newspapers and organizations: Since the fall of Tokyo, the state affairs have become increasingly urgent. All members of the Chinese nation share a common hatred of the enemy. Guitang, a mere warrior, was compelled by righteousness to lead his troops out of the pass last year, vowing to resist Japan to the death, with the determination to save the country or perish with it. Embracing the firm will to live or die together, sinking our boats and breaking our pots, we wielded our weapons to kill the enemy, our blood splattered on the frontier grass, and we went deep into western Liaoning, displaying a spirit of sacrifice and repeatedly frustrating the enemy's arrogance. We could have advanced eastward with our victories and cleared the border areas, but the national army retreated, and we were isolated. We faced a strong enemy without and lacked food and ammunition within. However, we still raised our arms and called upon the starving soldiers to resist the elite troops, one against ten, supporting ourselves for several days without losing an inch of land. But heaven did not favor us, and the snow submerged our shins. Without clothing or food, the soldiers were freezing and starving to death, and their numbers were about to be halved. At this time, I originally wanted to sacrifice myself for the country and fulfill my national obligations, but I was afraid that sacrificing myself would not help the current difficulties. How about enduring humiliation and borrowing strength to seek future opportunities? My sincerity can be attested by heaven and earth. From then on, although environmental pressures have increased, my determination to kill the enemy has become firmer. I have been biding my time, not forgetting the shame of Kuaiji. Fortunately, I am now standing on the same front as the anti-Japanese allied forces, sharpening my weapons and preparing my horses, with my banners pointing east. I would rather be a hero in battle than a survivor under occupation. As we march to the border, our grief is overwhelming. We will eliminate this enemy before our morning meal and restore our mountains and rivers. As I send this telegram, my thoughts race, awaiting your instructions. Liu Guitang, August 28th, dispatch not completed." (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Even the Central Catholic Church Will Find It Difficult to Survive</p>
<p>▲Reuters Berlin, 27th: Today, Chancellor Hitler ordered the dissolution of the National Party (formerly the Democratic Party). The reason for the dissolution was that the National Party had exchanged interests with the Socialist Party in the last election. The National Party holds five seats in the parliament and three seats in the Prussian parliament, which have now been revoked. The government is currently considering confiscating the party's property, and it is widely believed that the government will soon seek an excuse to dissolve the Central Catholic Church.</p>
<p>▲Reuters Berlin, 27th: Following a peaceful agreement between Chancellor Hitler and the leaders of the National Sovereignty Party, the so-called German National Front has been dissolved, and all members of the National Sovereignty Party in parliament have joined the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>▲Reuters Berlin, 27th: Although Hugenberg's resignation has not yet been officially accepted, it seems to have been decided to approve his resignation. Thereafter, all members of the National Sovereignty Party will be recognized as comrades and will enjoy protection and will not be discriminated against.

<p>The Uprising Was Carried Out After the End of the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>To Eliminate the Elder Statesmen and Overthrow the Privileged Class</p>
<p>▲Japan United Press, Tokyo, 28th: The first public trial of the Blood Pledge Corps' conspiracy to assassinate Mr. Junnosuke Inoue and Mr. Takuma Dan, and to attempt to assassinate prominent figures, opened at the Tokyo District Court at 9:00 AM on the 28th. The case has caused a sensation, and the details of the case are quite serious. Therefore, the audience flocked to the court last night to wait for the opening of the trial, but the authorities only allowed 62 of them to attend. After the judge, prosecutors, more than 20 defendants and their lawyers took their seats, the judge announced the opening of the trial. First, the identity of the defendant was investigated, and then the prosecutor stated the facts of the indictment.</p>
<p>▲Japan United Press, Tokyo, 28th: After the prosecutor finished stating the facts, the judge questioned the defendant Nissho Inoue on the following main issues:</p>
<p>Judge: "Is it true that the naval comrades decided to start an uprising after the Shanghai Incident was over?"</p>
<p>Inoue replied: "No, but they thought it would be better to decide to implement this matter separately."</p>
<p>Judge: "What was the method of assassination?"</p>
<p>Inoue replied: "It was originally planned to assassinate 20 representatives of the ruling class, but this was very difficult, so it was decided that each person would be responsible for killing one person."</p>
<p>Judge: "Is the defendant the ringleader?"</p>
<p>Inoue replied: "I was in charge of liaison and small-scale control affairs."</p>
<p>Judge: "Did you give special orders to the three defendants, Sho, Numahisago, and Kurosawa?"</p>
<p>Inoue replied: "I ordered them to be careful in carrying out their assigned goals." The judge and the defendant Inoue's answers lasted for more than two hours. At 11:50 AM, the court took a temporary recess and reopened at 1:00 PM to continue questioning Nissho Inoue.</p>
<p>Judge: "What kind of society does the defendant hope to realize and by what method?"</p>
<p>Inoue replied: "The method of building society has not been given much consideration, but I believe that Japanese party politics is the politics of a privileged class that despises the constitution. To break the current situation of Japan's impasse, it is necessary to first reform party politics, and to eliminate the elder statesmen and ask for the Emperor's judgment, so that the privileged class and the tyrannical can be punished for the crimes of the political parties."</p>
<p>Judge: "What are your thoughts now about your plan to assassinate?"</p>
<p>Inoue replied: "I have no special thoughts, but I am certain about the reasons for establishing this plan. I am prepared to die, but it is necessary to reform the current society."</p>
<p>Judge: "Did the defendant know that the assassination plan violated the law?" Inoue: "I knew it. I originally wanted to act legally, but because the current situation is an emergency, I am determined to break the law in an emergency to reform society. I am now awaiting death, please give me a fair trial."</p>
<p>The court adjourned at 2:35 PM. The second public trial will open at 9:00 AM on the 30th.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 27th - The main committee of the Disarmament Conference today decided to postpone the meeting until October 16th. However, this decision still needs to be approved by the General Committee on Thursday. The main committee will meet in September to listen to the results of Henderson's talks with the major powers and prepare the second reading draft of the British disarmament plan. This postponement to autumn is the result of an agreement reached yesterday between Henderson and Paul-Boncour in Paris. At the same time, Henderson expressed his opinion that negotiations between individual representatives should be conducted during the break from now until the resumption of the meeting.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Geneva, 27th - The Presidium of the Disarmament Conference met at 3:30 PM, chaired by Henderson. Despite the opposition of the German representative Nadolny, the Presidium decided to recommend to the General Committee, which will meet on Thursday, that the Disarmament Conference be postponed until October 16th.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Geneva, 27th - The Presidium of the Disarmament Conference met for only half an hour. Chairman Henderson advocated a temporary postponement of the meeting, waiting until his negotiations could achieve the necessary compromises before reconvening. The British representative Eden and the French representative Massigli both agreed. The Italian and Soviet delegations did not participate in the discussion. It was then decided to convene the General Committee on Thursday for a final decision. It is generally believed that the General Committee will approve the proposal for postponement when it meets on Thursday.</p>

<p>Japanese Newspapers Accused of Receiving Bribes from France</p>
<p>▲Havas, Tokyo, 28th - Recently, two men claiming to be representatives of Hitler summoned German expatriates in Tokyo to discuss the Nazi Party's platform and the establishment of a Nazi Party branch in Japan. One was a man named Schaf (an employee of Siemens), and the other was Tang Jiaduo (a journalist whose pen name was Shangde). The meeting was noisy. German Jews did not participate, needless to say. However, the attendees fiercely attacked the Nazi Party's anti-Semitism. Some said that since Hitler came to power, Japanese public opinion towards Germany has changed, indicating that the German government's policies have harmed Germany's interests in Japan, and cited Japanese newspaper editorials as evidence. The Hitler representatives strongly defended themselves, saying that Japanese newspaper arguments were being bribed by France. The German expatriates were unwilling to easily believe them. In the end, the Nazi Party members withdrew from the meeting, ultimately unable to make the German expatriate community care about politics.</p>

<p>Special dispatch from Peiping (Beiping). There is still no definite solution for the puppet army led by Li Jichun in the Luan River area. North China is in danger. Rectifying the situation is extremely difficult. The details of the puppet army's disturbances and its organizational overview are recorded below. The seriousness of the Luan River problem existed before the armistice agreement was signed.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Overview of the Puppet Army's Organization <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The puppet army led by Li Jichun and others took advantage of the Japanese army's disturbances in North China to occupy the area east and west of the Luan River, with ambitious intentions. Our army, due to many concerns, was restrained. Suppression was unsuccessful, and appeasement was not easy. Hesitation led to the puppet army's growing strength, making a solution more difficult. Now it has become a serious problem. The root cause is that domestic wars have been frequent in the past, and the political situation has not been stable, which has led past warlords and politicians to be lured by Japanese interests to go to the Northeast and act as accomplices under Japanese control, willingly betraying their country. Since the September 18th Incident, illegal organizations in Changchun have been established one after another. Many soldiers from the Zhili-Lu (Zhilu) faction have secretly left for Manchuria to join the puppet state. The Japanese then ordered them to form their own armies, directly subordinate to the puppet state and indirectly controlled and commanded by the Japanese, implementing a policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." Five armies were established one after another: (1) the First Army of Pacifying the Country, (2) the Second Army of Building the Country, (3) the Third Army of Protecting the Country, (4) the Fourth Army of Stabilizing the Country, and (5) the Fifth Army of Defending the Country. The First Army of Pacifying the Country was Yu Zhishan's unit, the Second Army of Building the Country was Cheng Guorui's unit, the Third Army of Protecting the Country was Huang Xiling's unit, the Fourth Army of Stabilizing the Country was Liu Peichen's unit, and the Fifth Army of Defending the Country was Zhao Huiqing's unit. Each recruited soldiers and horses and set up their own banners. Their troops were mostly composed of old Zhili-Lu soldiers and bandits from outside the pass. They were generally trained for three months and then formally formed into armies by order of the puppet military and political departments. Guns and ammunition were partly supplied by the Japanese, and the army's salaries were mostly raised locally. Although there were many people, the command was extremely uncoordinated, and there were often internal conflicts. The organization was disorganized. The Japanese were only using them temporarily. The greatest purpose was to make "Chinese kill Chinese." Initially, Yu Zhishan was the commander of the First Army of Pacifying the Country. Cheng Guorui gathered his old troops and led them to Changchun, where he was appointed by the Japanese as the commander of the Second Army of Building the Country of Manchuria, with Cheng as the commander-in-chief, directly commanding the army, claiming to have twenty regiments. Fang Yongchang was appointed as the chief of staff, and Liu Peichen was appointed as the deputy commander. Fang was expelled shortly after due to opposition from his subordinates. Liu also disagreed with Cheng and competed for military power, secretly fighting each other. Because Liu's strength was weak, he eventually lost and resigned from his position as puppet deputy commander. He formed another army, which was the Fourth Army, and appointed Jin Bihui as the deputy commander. Jin was the daughter of Prince Su of the former Qing dynasty. She had been in Japan for a long time and was also known as Kawashima Yoshiko. She had once gone to Manchuria with her brother Jin Bidong to persuade Su Bingwen. She was very beautiful and had an ambiguous relationship with Tada, a Japanese senior advisor to the puppet state, and thus obtained this position. At that time, scandalous secrets spread throughout the puppet capital. However, the army was disbanded only half a month after its formation because there were too few soldiers and more officers than soldiers. A unit of Cheng Guorui's puppet army also mutinied, so he resigned. The vacancy of commander of the Second Puppet Army was filled by Huang Xiling. The Fifth Army of Zhao Huiqing was also eliminated by the Japanese. At that time, the Rehe (Jehol) incident occurred. Zhao led his puppet army to western Liaoning in March of this year. When they arrived at Xinlitun, they suddenly encountered more than 50 members of the Japanese garrison on the way. The Japanese army mistakenly thought they were our volunteer army and prepared to encircle and attack them. Zhao was also furious and killed all the Japanese commanders and advisors in the army, leaving their bodies in front of the battle. The Japanese army then swept them with machine guns. Zhao also surrounded all the Japanese soldiers. None of the 50 survived. In this battle, they also captured ten machine guns. Just as they were preparing to revolt, the Japanese found out and sent a large unit to eliminate Zhao's troops. Zhao and his subordinate officers were all shot. The Fifth Army disintegrated without a trace. When the war in eastern Luanhe (Luandong) broke out, Li Jichun, due to his relationship with the first Tianjin Incident, requested the Kwantung Army to be the vanguard. If they could capture Tianjin and Peiping, they would give him the Luanhe area as a reward. At first, there were only a little over a thousand people. Later, Zhao Lei and others defected, and he recruited bandits everywhere, creating the current situation. In addition, Hao Peng, Bai Jianwu, and others united with Li. The plainclothes team that recently rioted in Tianjin was transported to Qinhuangdao to be commanded by Li. His power became even more rampant.</p>
<h3 id="e72">The People of Luanxi Are in Dire Straits <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The puppet army led by Li Jichun and Zhao Lei and others, under the name of the puppet National Salvation Army, occupy the area around the Luan River and the railway line. Shi Yousan is still in Qinhuangdao, plotting activities. Li's puppet headquarters is located inside Tangshan Jiaotong University. Li himself is also in Tangshan. The area from Tianzhuang to Xugezhuang on the Beining Railway is garrisoned by Li's troops. When the Japanese army withdraws from one place, he follows up and fills the position. Food and salaries are also becoming increasingly sufficient. Taxes are levied arbitrarily, and the people are in dire straits. The strength has increased rapidly, making it difficult to resolve. Our side previously contacted the Japanese embassy, hoping to implement the truce agreement. The Japanese embassy's military attache, Nagatsu, took our side's opinions to Changchun to meet with the Kwantung Army Commander Muto for consultation. There has been no reply for a long time. Negotiations with the Japanese embassy's secretary, Nakayama, are continuing in the hope that the puppet army issue can be resolved quickly. It is rumored in Beijing that the puppet army will withdraw 20 li from the railway line, but this has not yet been implemented. The Japanese and puppet troops in Lugou still guard the railway and harass us from time to time. At about 10 p.m. on the 26th, the puppet army from the village fired at us, but we did not retaliate. The situation was quickly calmed down. There are still more than 200 puppet troops stationed in Ninghe City. After Nagatsu went to Changchun, he was suddenly dispatched by the Japanese General Staff to leave China for inspections in various countries for a period of two years. Nagatsu has now rushed to Harbin from Changchun, and it is said that he may not return to Peiping for the time being. His position as a military attache at the Japanese embassy will be concurrently held by Shibayama. Shibayama has now arrived in Shanghai and will soon leave Shanghai for the north. In the future, our side will continue to negotiate with Shibayama on the disposal of the puppet army, and it is difficult to reach a concrete solution at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Beining (Peiping-Mukden) Railway Eastern Line Through Traffic Issue <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Qian Zongze, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, came to Peiping to meet with He Yingqin and Huang Fu to discuss the issue of the Beining Railway's through traffic with the Japanese side. He returned to Tianjin yesterday to continue negotiations. At noon today, Qian Fu arrived in Peiping from Tianjin and visited the military and political authorities to report on everything. According to Qian, the issue of through traffic is in progress and will be realized in the near future, but there is no concrete decision yet. The eastbound train only reaches Lutai. The Beining Railway's income has sharply decreased since the route was shortened. Although the Sino-Japanese truce agreement was signed long ago, the puppet army in Luanxi is still disturbing the railway line, causing many obstacles. Various countries have criticized this. The issue of through traffic is a matter of urgency. The international train that arrived in Lutai from Tianjin the other day, after repeated negotiations with the puppet army by the Americans, the puppet army only allowed it to open to Tangshan. If it goes east, there are many bandits along the way and they cannot be responsible. Therefore, the Americans did not dare to try it easily and returned to Tianjin. In short, unless the puppet army is transferred away, the issue of through traffic cannot be resolved. It is rumored that the Beining Railway plans to conduct a trial run of international trains to Qinhuangdao on July 1. Huang Fu and He Yingqin have agreed to contact the Japanese side, but it is not yet known whether it can be realized. The railway is in economic straits and will implement large-scale layoffs in the coming days to avoid owing salaries. There are many idle employees at the various stations of the railway bureau, and without doing so, it is not enough to balance income and expenditure. Qian returned to Tianjin by car this afternoon after completing his official duties to plan everything. (June 27)</p>

The Zhangjiakou incident, due to Song Zheyuan's mediation, has sent representatives several times to negotiate with Feng, and there has been hope for a peaceful resolution for a time. Recently, Song Zheyuan was ordered to return to Chahar, and someone is responsible for the Chahar provincial administration. The central government has also agreed to properly resettle the various armies of Fang Zhenwu and Deng Wen, which is progressing smoothly. Suddenly, there was another twist. Zhang Jiyong went to Zhangjiakou again, but to no avail. After returning to Peiping on the 23rd, he submitted Feng's four proposed opinions to Song and forwarded them to He Yingqin and Huang Fu for detailed discussion. Everyone felt that the Chahar affair was difficult. That night, they telegraphed the central government and Commander Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. So far, no reply telegram has arrived in Peiping. The various parties believe that the issue of the puppet army in Luanxi has not been resolved for a long time, and the Japanese side's opinions on the truce agreement are quite inconsistent internally. The withdrawal of the Japanese army is still extremely slow. If the situation in eastern Chahar changes, the overall situation in North China will be affected, and the future crisis is unimaginable. Therefore, they are quite anxious about Feng's recent attitude. Now Song Zheyuan has expressed that he will not return to Chahar for the time being. The first step in the authorities' decision on the Chahar affair is still to seek a solution by peaceful means. They do not want to lightly start a war. Even if it is unavoidable, they will not use force internally. All measures are carefully handled with the aim of consolidating the security of Chahar Province and ensuring that North China, which has been turned from danger to safety, is not affected by the Chahar affair. As for how to protect Chahar Province, they have always advocated that the government should be directly responsible. For example, the puppet armies of Liu Guitang, Cui Xingwu, and others in eastern Chahar have long been under the protection of the Japanese. Their organizations are not sound, and their intentions are unpredictable. In order to eliminate the rebels, it is impossible to tolerate them. How to deal with them in the future is still under consideration.</p>
<p>The central government has now decided to send Kong Xiangxi north to inspect and visit Yan Xishan in Bingyi on the way. Yan Xishan has now returned to his hometown of Hebian Village for a short rest. Kong will take a plane from Shanghai to Peiping on the 27th and will go directly to Hebian to meet with Yan to convey the central government's intentions. Yan's recent attitude has been consistent with the central government. Although he has not expressed anything to Feng, in addition to protecting Shanxi and developing industry, he will probably not participate in this anti-Japanese military action in Chahar.

<h3 id="e75">Liu Guitang Defects <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Liu Has Led His Troops to Retreat to Guyuan</p>
<p>Kangbao and Baochang Have Both Been Recovered</p>
<p>Fang Ji and Other Troops Concentrated in Zhangbei</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Peiping. After Zhangjiakou decided to send troops to resist Japan and recover the lost territory, Feng Yuxiang appointed Fang Zhenwu as the commander of the Northern Route Army, Ji Hongchang as the commander of the Northern Route Army, Deng Wen as the left deputy commander, and Li Zhongyi as the right deputy commander. After receiving the order, Fang and others telegraphed their appointments. Their troops were concentrated in Zhangbei and advanced on separate routes. Liu Guitang also telegraphed his defection, and his troops retreated to Guyuan, preparing to counterattack western Rehe. Liu's telegram also stated his loyalty to the enemy. The original telegram is as follows: "Since the fall of the Northeast, I have served the Japanese, and all of my Chinese nation hate the enemy. Guitang, a soldier, is obliged to resist Japan. Last year, I led my troops out of the pass and fought to the death against Japan, determined to survive or die with the territory, and determined to die with the land. I smashed the pot and broke the boat, and I killed the enemy with my spears. Blood splattered on the border grass, and I went deep into western Liaoning. With the spirit of sacrifice, I repeatedly frustrated the enemy's power. I could have taken advantage of the victory to advance eastward and pacify the border. However, the national army retreated westward, and I was isolated. There was an enemy outside, and there was no food or ammunition inside. However, I still shouted and drove the hungry soldiers to resist the elite troops, fighting with injuries, fighting one against ten, and supporting for several months without losing an inch of land. But heaven did not help me. The snow fell to my knees, and there was no clothing or food. The soldiers died of hunger and cold, and nearly half of them died. At this time, I wanted to die for my country and fulfill my obligations as a citizen. But I was afraid that killing myself would not help the situation. How could I endure humiliation and burden, and gradually claim to be a state, borrowing capital to take advantage, and the blood can be tested by heaven and sun? From then on, the environment pressed, and I increased my wisdom in judging the enemy, and I tasted the shame of Kuaiji, and I could not forget it. Then I was fortunate to stand on the same front with my anti-Japanese friendly army, feeding the horses and encouraging the soldiers, and the flag pointed to the east. I would rather be a hero in the battlefield than a coward in peacetime. Revitalize the frontier. I cannot bear the grief and indignation. Destroy this dynasty and eat, return my mountains and rivers, and face the gods. I hope that Liu Gui is forgiven."</p>
<p>Fang and Shi ancient style [unclear characters], Ji immediately set up a command headquarters in Zhangbei, commanding the various troops to advance eastward. Deng Wen, Li Zhong [unclear character] · Nie Yuling · the various armies and Wang Shiming and other [unclear character] detachments also gradually concentrated in Zhangbei and moved out on separate routes. Zhang Renjie's division of Fang's troops also sent a part to Zhangbei. Before Feng took office, Liu Guitang sent personnel to contact him to surrender. Recently, he sent his deputy commander Shang Wu as a representative to be responsible for discussing surrender and anti-Japanese methods with Feng. Feng held the tenet that those who resist Japan are friends, and Liu became resolute in the defection. His troops stationed in Kangbao and Baochang began to withdraw to Guyuan on the 22nd. Most of them have now concentrated in Guyuan. Kangbao and Baochang were recovered on the 24th and garrisoned by Wang Shiming's detachment. Today (27th), Feng has sent a telegram to Peiping, reporting that Kangbao and Baochang have been recovered and is currently advancing towards Doron. In addition to a unit of Japanese troops, Moki Cavalry, stationed in the Doron area, there are also more than 2,000 rebel troops under Cui Xingwang. Cui has also sent personnel to contact Feng to surrender. Now the Northern Route Anti-Japanese Army is preparing to contact Liu Guitang's troops after most of them are concentrated in Kangbao and Baochang, and then attack Doron, hoping to completely recover the lost territory in eastern Chahar in the shortest period of time.

<h3 id="e76">Anti-Shen (Honglie) Movement in the Northeast Navy <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Shen's Attitude is Passive and Has Telegraphed to the Central Government to Resign</p>
<p>The Haiqi and Other Three Ships Freely Sail Out of the Port</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication. Shen Honglie, the commander of the Northeast Navy and the mayor of Qingdao, was unsuccessfully assassinated by his subordinate Feng Zhichong at the Dagang pier at 4 p.m. on the 24th of this month, as reported in the previous newspaper. Because the matter is important, the reporter inquired from all parties and personally visited Mr. Shen to inquire about everything. The information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Reasons for the Assassination There are two reasons for this incident: (1) Since Mr. Shen also held the position of mayor, the lower-level officers of the Northeast Navy, which he directly controlled, believed that the opportunity to get promoted and make a fortune had arrived. Therefore, they all wanted to seize a seat as the chief of the Qingdao Municipal Public Security Bureau, the captain of the security team, and the important officials of the various agencies under the municipal government. However, Mr. Shen has never changed a single important official of the various agencies under the municipal government unless there are special circumstances. His subordinates were inevitably disappointed with Mr. Shen because their desires were not fulfilled. This is the first reason for resentment among subordinates. (2) Mr. Shen has recently been very serious about the ban on smoking. A few months ago, Mr. Shen instructed the officials of both the municipal government and the navy that anyone addicted to this habit must quit within a time limit. If they do not quit after the deadline, they will be dismissed once discovered. Even close relatives will not be lightly spared. Many lower-level officers of the navy are addicted to these bad habits. Although Mr. Shen has repeatedly ordered and emphasized it, many of those who complied with the deadline to quit are indeed few, and those who ignore the command are also numerous. Therefore, several people have been investigated by Mr. Shen and given the punishment of dismissal, and those who have not been investigated are also uneasy. This is the second reason for resentment among subordinates. In addition, the Northeast Navy originally owed military pay for as long as four months. After Mr. Shen also became the mayor, his subordinates hoped that Mr. Shen would use the income from Qingdao to pay off the arrears. However, after Mr. Shen took office as mayor, he did not create a source of income for the navy. Old arrears were not mentioned. This is also one of the reasons for resentment among subordinates.</p>
<p>▲Details of the Assassination Since Mr. Shen had caused resentment among his subordinates, the lower-level officers of the navy had a brewing anti-Shen movement (but the interior was not unanimous, and there were also those who advocated supporting Shen). Feng Zhichong, the gunner of the Zhenhai ship, was one of the anti-Shen members. At 4 p.m. on the 24th of this month, when Shen took the Haiwang small launch from the Dagang wharf to the Zhenhai ship for a speech, Feng also went on the same boat, in addition to Shen's follower Shi Fusheng (Shen usually did not have guards when he went out, only taking a servant). When the boat left the wharf and sailed not far, Feng took out a pistol from his side and shot at Shen, firing three shots in a row, all of which missed. Fortunately, Shen's follower Shi Fusheng was beside him and rushed forward to push Feng away. Feng fell into the water. At that time, Shen remained calm and composed, and was escorted by Shi to the Zhenhai ship for a speech to the officers and soldiers. Shi then returned by small launch. At that time, Feng had been fished up with cedar planks by the Dagang branch of the Third Public Security Bureau. Shi explained the situation of Feng's assassination, and a Browning pistol and 89 bullets were found on Feng's body. Since the pistol he had previously held had fallen into the sea, Feng was guarded by the branch. After being interrogated by the naval headquarters in the evening, he was executed by shooting the next morning.</p>
<p>▲Jointly Overthrowing Shen After this incident, Mr. Shen originally did not want to pursue the matter too much, so he only had Feng shot dead. Unexpectedly, Feng's accomplices and others, because Shen quickly imposed a heavy punishment on Feng, jointly launched a movement to overthrow Shen with other lower-level officers. Among them, the pro-Shen faction was isolated and weak and was coerced by the crowd and dared not resist. The party also falsely used the name of the entire navy to demand that Mr. Shen step down. Important officials of the naval headquarters and the captains of the various ships stationed in Qingdao have been gathering in the headquarters for days to discuss solutions. While the matter was being discussed, the Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaoe three ships berthed in the rear actually disobeyed the orders of their superiors (the captains of the three ships were not on the ships) and took free action on the 26th, sailing out of the port (some say they went south, some say they went to Weihai, not knowing which is true). And this matter has become increasingly stiff and cannot be resolved. However, it is heard that Mr. Shen's personal attitude has been extremely negative since suffering this blow. He is eager to take this opportunity to step back and recuperate. It is heard that yesterday he telegraphed to the Central Military Commission and the Executive Yuan, requesting to resign from his positions as naval commander and Qingdao mayor. It is not yet known whether he will be approved.</p>
<p>▲Shen's Talk According to Shen's talk to the reporter, I have asked myself that I have always been upright in my life and dealings with people. Unfortunately, this change happened, which is beyond my expectation. But I will never be discouraged because of this. Before the central government approves my resignation, I will do my duty for one day in office and will never give up my post. (June 27)</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Opening Ceremony of the Sujia Highway Was Held <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>=The Total Length is 76 Kilometers and the Construction Cost is More Than 700,000 Yuan=</p>
<p>The Sujia Highway is one of the six major highways set by the National Economic Commission. Yesterday (28th) at 10:00 a.m., the opening ceremony was held at the Suzhou Mudu Bridge. Important officials from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces attended the ceremony. Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, and Dong Xiujia, the Director of the Construction Department of Jiangsu Province, both gave earnest speeches. At around 11:00 a.m., Madam Qin Fen cut the line to open the road, and the guests took the car directly to Jiaxing. After arriving in Jiaxing, the Zhejiang Provincial Government hosted a lunch at the Yanyu Tower. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e78">Meeting Situation <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10 AM, Zhejiang Construction Bureau Chief Zeng Yangfu, Jiangsu Construction Bureau Chief Dong Xiujia, National Economic Council Member Qin Fen, Finance Ministry Secretary Guo Dehua, accompanied by his wife Guo Huang Qianhong, and Wuxian Construction Bureau Technician Qian Tianpeng, arrived at the venue one after another. A wooden stage was temporarily erected at the venue, with a white cloth banner inscribed with the seven characters "Suzhou-Jiaxing Road Opening Ceremony." A flower basket, a gift from the Ford Motor Company, was placed on the stage. American Commercial Counselor Smith, Shanghai Municipal Council Political Department Representative Shaweness, and Shanghai Municipal Council Merchant Corps Commander Thomas also went early to attend. The meeting began at 10 AM. First, Zhejiang Construction Bureau Chief Zeng Yangfu delivered a speech, roughly stating that he was representing the Zhejiang Provincial Government today to attend the opening ceremony. He noted that the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road is crucial for connecting the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Although there were difficulties during construction, it was ultimately completed due to the joint efforts of the two provincial governments. In the past year, the completed highways in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces include the Nanjing-Hangzhou Road, Nanjing-Wuhu Road, and Xuan-Chang Road, and the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road is also completed and opened to traffic today. However, the road surface of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road cannot be compared with urban roads due to various reasons. Each kilometer of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road costs only six to seven thousand yuan, which is five to six times less than the value of urban roads in Shanghai. However, this road is designed for transportation, not for aesthetics like urban roads. Therefore, we must look at it from a different perspective. Next, Jiangsu Construction Bureau Chief Dong Xiujia delivered a speech, roughly saying, "The Suzhou-Jiaxing Road was completed in a short period, and the National Economic Council has made a great contribution. If the council had not provided economic and technical assistance, the completion of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road would likely have been delayed for several months. After the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road is opened to traffic, the transportation between Suzhou and Jiaxing can avoid the trouble of detouring through Shanghai, saving time and money, and boosting the financial flow between Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, as the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road passes through a corner of Taihu Lake, some people may suspect that the bandits in Taihu Lake may have malicious plans. However, the reason for the rampant bandits in Taihu Lake is actually due to inconvenient transportation. Now that transportation is convenient, the bandits in Taihu Lake will naturally not dare to plot anything again, and the military and police's suppression of bandits will also be greatly effective due to the completion of this road. The Jiangsu Construction Bureau is currently planning to build a Suzhou ring road to revitalize the Suzhou business market," and so on. Following this, Qin Fen reported on the construction of the road. It was already 11 AM when the bell rang, and Qin Fen's wife then performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Secretary Zhu of the National Economic Council presented a silver scissors, over a foot long, to Mrs. Qin. Mrs. Qin held the scissors and cut the red ribbon placed across the road. At that moment, applause erupted, cheering "Long live the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road!" Six cars, full of guests, slowly drove onto the road. A cargo truck, carrying a team of the Wuxian Security Corps, led the way with armed protection. The other cars followed in a single file. A car belonging to Zhejiang Construction Bureau Chief Zeng Yangfu and a charcoal-powered car followed behind. After leaving the meeting venue at Mudu Bridge, the first major bridge encountered was the newly built Xindai Bridge. After ten minutes, the cars crossed the bridge. At 12 PM, they arrived in Wujiang, Suzhou; at 12:25 PM, they arrived in Beishe; at 12:50 PM, they passed Pingwang; at 1:10 PM, they passed Shengze; at 1:45 PM, they passed Wangjiangjing. Due to the uneven road surface along the way, the cars could not drive quickly. At 2:30 PM, they finally arrived in Jiaxing. The Zhejiang Provincial Government specially prepared lunch at the Nanhu Misty Rain Tower, inviting the special guests to cross the lake.

<h3 id="e80">Construction Process <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The area traversed by the road is under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, so the construction was undertaken separately by the construction departments of the two provinces. Planning began in June of the 21st year of the Republic of China, and the entire road was completed in June of this year, taking exactly one year from start to finish. The construction process of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang sections is described separately as follows: (1) Jiangsu Section: This section starts from the customs house east of Panmen in Suzhou and ends at Wangjiangjing Town on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, with a total length of 52.1 kilometers. The northern section of the roadbed was started in the 19th year of the Republic of China. The Suzhou to Wujiang section was built by requisitioned labor by the Wuxian Construction Bureau, but the width was only 5 meters. The Wujiang to Bachichi section was also once built by requisitioned labor by the Wujiang County Construction Bureau, but the roadbed was only in its rudimentary form, with a significant difference in height. Bridge and culvert projects were also undertaken by the construction bureaus of the two counties. A total of ten reinforced concrete bridges, ten wooden bridges, five culverts, and more than eighty water pipes were completed in the Suzhou-Wujiang section. The route south of Bachichi passes through numerous rivers, with a low-lying terrain, and the engineering was quite extensive. The counties were limited by financial resources, so construction had been delayed for a long time. In May of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the council recognized that the road was extremely important for transportation between the two provinces and should be completed quickly. Therefore, the road was listed as one of the three provinces' connecting highways, and Guo Lian consultant Ao Jingji was assigned to jointly survey the Pinghu to Wangjiangjing section of the route with the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department. The original route of this section was to pass through the Grand Canal from Bachichi, along the east bank to Pingwang Town, then cross the river and head straight to Wangjiangjing. It required the construction of two large bridges, and the villages and towns passed through were also more remote. Consultant Ao suggested changing the route, going along the west bank of the Grand Canal from Bachichi, passing west of Pingwang Town, passing Shengze Town, and heading to areas that could be expected to develop. The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department followed his advice and ordered the county to remeasure. Once the route was determined, the Suwang Section Engineering Office was established in Pingwang in August of the same year. After September, various projects were started one after another. By the end of the 21st year of the Republic of China, 70-80% of the roadbed earthwork and bridge projects had been completed, and a large amount of road surface materials had also been transported. However, due to the continuous rain and snow in winter, the progress of the project was slower in January and February of the 22nd year. After March, it resumed active progress, and the bridge, culvert, embankment, retaining wall, and road surface projects were completed successively. (2) Zhejiang Section: This section starts from the Grand Canal Bridge outside Jiaxing City and ends at Wangjiangjing on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, with a total length of 14.7 kilometers. After the council included this section in the three provinces' connecting highways in May of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau planned and implemented the project, establishing the Jiawang Section Engineering Office in Jiaxing. The entire section started construction simultaneously. Because the mileage was short and the area was a plain, construction was relatively easy, so the project progressed very quickly. The entire section of roadbed earthwork was completed in October of the 21st year of the Republic of China, and the bridge, culvert, and water pipe projects were also completed in November of the same year. However, the Grand Canal Bridge near Jiaxing was a larger project and was not completed until April of this year. The road surface project was completed in early March of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Project Overview <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The entire Suzhou-Jiaxing Road project was carried out in accordance with the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Highway Engineering Standards and the highway engineering standards stipulated by the council. Because the entire road route passes through plains, the grades and curves are quite good. Only the grades near the bridgeheads are slightly steeper, but still not more than 3%. The radius of curvature is more than 70 meters. The load-bearing capacity of the bridges is 12 tons in the Suzhou-Jiaxing section, and slightly less in the Zhejiang section. A sectional description of the project overview is given below: (1) Jiangsu Section: The roadbed width is 7.5 meters. In addition to the approximately 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork already completed by the county government, approximately 480,000 cubic meters of new earthwork was done. The width of the crushed brick soil surface in the middle is 2 meters. The bridgeheads and areas near the lakes were widened appropriately to facilitate passing vehicles. In addition to the bridges and culverts already built by the county construction bureau, 43 new wooden bridges were built, the largest of which was the Dai Bridge near Suzhou. The bridge was originally intended to utilize the existing stone arch bridge, but after the Jiangsu Construction Department sent personnel to investigate in detail, it was found that the width of the bridge was insufficient, and the bridge foundation and arch were gradually collapsing, which was not conducive to traffic. Even if it could be widened and reinforced, the result would likely still be unsuitable. Therefore, it was decided to build a new wooden bridge about 60 meters west of the old bridge, with a total of 29 spans, measuring 232 meters in length. The bridge deck line adopts an arched shape, so the middle spans are quite high above the water surface, allowing ships to pass through. The length of the other bridges varies from 6 meters to over 60 meters. In addition, there are ten reinforced concrete culverts and 157 concrete water pipes in the entire section. The route from Bachichi to Pingwang passes through the three lakes of Tangjia Lake, Majia Lake, and San Dang. The lake water is very deep, and it is difficult to obtain soil for filling, so the earthwork for filling is quite difficult. Because one side faces the river and the other side faces the lake, there is concern that the wind and waves will erode the roadbed and cause it to collapse. Stone retaining walls were built on both sides of the embankment, and stone slopes were built on the embankment slope, rising above the water surface for protection. The three lakes' retaining walls are over 1,500 meters long, costing over 57,000 yuan. The total project budget for the entire section, as approved by the council, is 562,920 yuan, with a road construction fund of 180,134 yuan borrowed from the council. (2) Zhejiang Section: The roadbed width is 7.5 meters. The total earthwork is approximately 135,000 cubic meters. The width of the road surface in the middle is 3 meters. The road surface material is crushed brick in the lower layer and crushed stone in the upper layer. This is because this section is closer to Ganpu, where mountain stone can be mined and transported, so crushed stone road surface is used as appropriate. There are a total of 18 bridges, of which the Grand Canal Bridge near Jiaxing is the largest project. The river is wide and the traffic is very frequent, so a reinforced concrete truss bridge was built to ensure its strength. The entire bridge has eight spans, with a total length of 76 meters. The remaining 17 bridges are all wooden bridges, ranging in length from 6 meters to 28 meters. The total project budget for the entire section, as approved by the council, is 141,443 yuan, with a road construction fund of 45,262 yuan borrowed from the council. In summary, the total project budget for the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road Jiangsu and Zhejiang sections, as approved by the council, is 704,363 yuan, of which the road construction fund borrowed from the council is 225,396 yuan. Among the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui connecting highways, this road project is the most significant, apart from the Hangzhou...</p>

<h3 id="e83">Mr. Dong's Talk <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Also, according to Jiangsu Construction Bureau Chief Dong Xiujia's discussion on the practical problems of various road surfaces, roughly, there are many types of road surfaces, but the choice depends on the amount of road construction funds and traffic conditions, and cannot be generalized. Speaking of its advantages and disadvantages, according to the current situation of insufficient government financial resources and rural economic bankruptcy in our country, it does not seem necessary to demand how beautiful it is, as long as the road surface can be consolidated. Therefore, the most suitable road bureau in our country at present, (1) rubble road, (2) crushed brick road, (3) crushed stone road, among the three, rubble road is the most suitable, because the rubble road is made of stone blocks, and no matter what skill is required during paving, anyone can engage in this work, which is most suitable for the system of requisitioning labor for road construction. Although its appearance is not very beautiful, it is quite durable in substance, and can last for a long time without breaking. The road maintenance work after the road is completed is relatively easy, and even if there is damage, one or two stone pieces can be replaced at any time without major repairs. A part of the Suzhou section of the Jingwu Road surface is made of rubble, and it has been nine months since then. After a recent inspection, it was found that the rubble has not changed. Based on this, its advantages can be proved. Crushed brick road is made of crushed brick, which is more solid than rubble road, but the price required is too high. The current section of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road is using this kind of road surface. Crushed stone road is made of crushed stone flattened. Although the road surface seems beautiful, it is extremely non-durable. Once the road surface is washed by wind and rain, it is very easy to damage, and the yellow mud and yellow sand mix together and float on the road surface, which is very easy to slip. After the car travels, the mud track peaks up, so the road maintenance project is very large at ordinary times. Although the construction cost is slightly saved, it is quite uneconomical in comparison. The Anhui section of the Jingwu Road is this kind of road surface. At first glance, it is very beautiful. However, the characteristic of these three kinds of road surfaces is that the cost is slightly cheaper, and so on. (Daily News)</p>

At times, behind everyone's back, he used the red-headed rope of the bedstead bamboo to tie around his neck in the room. His feet did not leave the ground, but he was tragically strangled to death. When his family discovered it, it was too late to save him. Those who spoke about it all expressed their astonishment.</p>
<p>Five Warehouse Township Villagers Robbed</p>
<p>At the home of Zhuang Hehe, a villager in Wu Warehouse Township, on the night of the 26th, suddenly eight or nine bandits speaking a local dialect broke into the house, dragged the victim from the bed, tied him up with ropes, and robbed him of about 500 yuan in foreign currency before fleeing with a shout.</p>

<p>Provincial Order to Search Lu Changlang's Home</p>
<p>The other day, the county authorities received a secret order from the provincial government, stating that Lu Changlang, a former member of the House of Representatives from Tangji Bridge in this county, was suspected of treason and should be searched immediately. The county Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Zhengcong was instructed to lead the entire police squad, fully armed, to surround Lu's residence on all sides and search the interior. For a time, traffic was cut off, and the... situation was terrifying. Lu was a member of the Tongmenghui in the late Qing Dynasty and was a close friend of Chen Yingren, Yao Zhiqiang, and others. In the early Republic, Yuan Shikai was in power and appointed Xu Baoshan to garrison the Songhu area. Lu designed to assassinate him by bombing him, and was subsequently wanted and fled to Japan. Later, he served as a member of the House of Representatives. When Cao Kun was elected, he fled to rely on the Extraordinary President Sun Yat-sen and participated in the Constitutional Protection Movement. After Sun Yat-sen passed away, he returned home to chant scriptures and did not participate in external affairs. Recently, with the Japanese pirates in the Northeast, his nerves became disturbed, and he scolded the east, day and night, from the... building, pointing his halberd finger. He also destroyed all the Buddha statues he worshiped. The other day, his madness flared up, and he wrote a special letter to the provincial government authorities, saying, "I have already declared myself emperor, and you should quickly choose an auspicious day to come and pay homage." The provincial authorities were unaware that he was already insane and ordered the county to search nearby. It is now known that there are no prohibited items in his home, and his son has issued a certificate confirming that he is indeed insane. Therefore, a factual report has been submitted, and for several days, teahouses and taverns have been spreading the word, making it a laughingstock.</p>

<p>Provincial Huaiyin Normal School Careless</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Huaiyin Normal School in this city, inside the West Gate, has two playgrounds, east and west. At the south end of the west playground, there used to be a row of tile-roofed bungalows, where the school's infirmary, barber shop, and other facilities were located. Last week, the final examinations for all grades were completed, and most of the students returned home. The doors of the infirmary and other rooms were locked. Unexpectedly, today (6 PM on the 25th), a fire broke out in the infirmary due to an electrical short circuit. When people heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, the fire had already reached the roof. The school staff and the principal, etc., supervised the school workers to do their best to put out the fire, and it was finally extinguished. However, several bungalows had been burned down. Fortunately, the school's student dormitories, department classrooms, and auditorium were not affected. Principal Gu has now prepared a report and telegrammed the Education Department to report on the incident.</p>

<p>Xia Dianneng, a farmer from Liudu in the third district of Huaiyin, argued with Xia Dianbang because he refused to lend him a plow. The argument led to a fight, and Xia Dianneng was beaten on the head by the Dianying brothers with sticks. On the 24th, he was taken to the Renci Hospital outside the city for treatment, but died of his injuries. Xia Dianneng had a younger brother, Dianyang, who went to the county government to file a complaint, requesting an autopsy and prosecution. Judge Xiao went to examine the body yesterday afternoon and confirmed that he had been fatally injured by a wooden stick during his lifetime. He issued an arrest warrant for Xia Dianying and others to be dealt with according to law.</p>

<p>Peace Tide Bandits Massacre Each Other</p>
<p>Pinghu bandits massacred each other due to uneven distribution of spoils, resulting in a firefight. When the police and militia heard the gunshots, they went to capture the bandits, who fled with their wounded and dead. Among them was a man named Geng Man, who was shot three times. Before he could escape, he was intercepted by the police and militia and sent to the county government. After interrogation, he was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Chairman's Report <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>After performing the rituals, the Presidium unanimously elected Wang Xiaolai to report, who briefly said, "This is the third time that our association has held a National Goods Promotion Rally. After repeated promotion by our association, the citizens have a considerable understanding of the need to promote national goods. Therefore, today I dare to advise you with the eight characters 'National Goods Save the Nation, Local Save the Nation.' As for promoting national goods, we must start from ourselves and then extend to our local areas. I hope that everyone will promote national goods and expand national goods so that national goods can have considerable development, and the country will gradually prosper. When the country exists, the people exist; when the country perishes, the people perish. The country and the people cannot be separated and independent. I hope that from today onwards, everyone will work together to promote and expand national goods," and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Guest Speeches <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Next, Ji Zepu, Director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, delivered a speech entitled "Prerequisites for Promoting National Products," roughly stating that before advocating for national products, there are various issues that must be resolved first. Only then will promoting national products have a significant effect. This is what past events have told us. I will only speak briefly based on my personal observations, but what I am about to say may not be welcomed by everyone. However, for the sake of promoting the improvement of national products and increasing consumer purchasing power, I would like to speak with you in the most earnest manner. I hope there will be no misunderstandings. A. Regarding the lack of production, our country was originally an agricultural nation and has not paid much attention to industry. Since the opening of the sea borders, the loss of China's annual trade deficit has been enormous. Therefore, patriots in the country are deeply worried and realize the importance of industry. Establishing factories for self-manufacturing is the only way to counter the huge outflow of wealth. Now, factories are springing up and gradually developing, which is an excellent phenomenon. However, upon further observation, the common problem with today's Chinese industries is that, in the early stages of operation, those in charge are diligent, hardworking, and strive to conduct research, showing vigorous momentum. The products also achieve considerable results. But once money becomes abundant and business develops, they no longer deepen their research on production improvement or continue their efforts. As a result, business declines and the quality of products deteriorates. This is also an undeniable fact in the history of Chinese industry. In contrast, factories in other countries send people out to investigate various products and methods to reduce costs. People who start businesses are willing to continue to work hard and conduct research, so their businesses can take deep root. B. Inevitable jealousy among competitors is a widespread malady among Chinese merchants. This kind of mentality, planted in our hearts, is most likely to hinder the development of Chinese industry. Because of competition among the same trades, our country does not hesitate to make unnecessary sacrifices and does not know how much life and property have been lost. Therefore, there is advocacy for cooperation. I hope that Chinese people will broaden their horizons and do things based on the spirit of cooperation, only then will they have the qualifications to resist foreign goods. Otherwise, it is self-deception. International trusts formed by foreigners emphasize international cooperation and compete with other countries. For example, when Soviet Russian kerosene was promoted in China, companies such as Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum Company, and Texaco joined forces and lowered prices to compete with Soviet Russia, which was starting commercial activities. Even with different nationalities, foreigners can still cooperate. Can we not feel ashamed when we see this? C. Regarding the lack of consumption, the consumption of citizens in powerful countries is not unconscious. Everything they use is bought from their own country's products. They are never willing to easily give money to foreigners. Citizens are willing to buy goods based on this significant benefit, so the country can be strong and the people rich. Looking at the psychology and level of consumers in our country, there are many areas that are truly depressing. 1. Chinese people in general are the only consumers, because they own huge assets. Therefore, for the purchase of all enjoyment items, regardless of which country's goods they are, or what the value is, they only use the most noble and beautiful as the standard. For example, dozens of gold coins for a piece of clothing material, dozens of yuan for a pair of socks, etc. National products are naturally not welcome. How can national products be promoted when there are such consumers in the country? This is a major flaw in Chinese consumers. 2. Ordinary Chinese consumers are a large number of people with strong purchasing power, but most of them have not received sufficient education and do not know what a country is. Therefore, for the purchase of everything they use, regardless of right or wrong, or which country's goods they are, they always use low prices as the standard. Therefore, foreigners use this weakness to promote goods in large quantities. This is also a major reason why national products are not fully selling. In addition to the shortcomings of both production and consumption, there are also some merchants who worship foreigners and specialize in promoting foreign goods, changing labels and numbers. This also makes it unclear whether national products are different from foreign goods, so those who are patriotic and willing to buy them are at a loss. With such phenomena existing in the country, it is not easy to promote national products. Finally, looking at the advanced industrial countries in Europe and America, their products can be called the crown of the world, but they still think it is not enough. Therefore, for each type of product, they hold grand exhibitions and publicity conferences every year, using various unique official publicity methods to make the national people deeply aware of their country's products. Even industrially advanced countries are still working hard to publicize national products. Our country, which is backward and still in its infancy, should work harder to publicize national products, so that the national people are aware of the characteristics of the products of various factories in the country, and then sales will inevitably increase day by day and month by month. Next, Wu Zhihao, Ling Yun, Shen Tianxin, Chen Jicheng, and Cao Zhigong gave speeches successively. The speeches were long and will be omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Radio Broadcast <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, Mr. Yu Zhongxian used the radio to broadcast on Greater China Radio, and the topic was "The True Meaning of the National Goods Movement," roughly saying, "What I want to talk about today is the method after the national goods movement. In the world, no matter which nation, there is no one who does not practice survival of the fittest. Therefore, from September 18th of the year before last and January 28th of last year to the present, the Japanese army has been invincible in our country, advancing and occupying territory, letting them cut and carve. This is not because the Japanese army conquered us, nor is it because Japan has a large amount of military spending to conquer us, but it is because Japan's skills conquered us. The Japanese have the skills to make sophisticated guns and cannons, and can make poison gas that kills without bloodshed. We cannot make them, or are unwilling to work hard to research and manufacture sophisticated military equipment. Recently, Japan has come to provoke us, and it can be said that people with industrial manufacturing skills are conquering people without industrial manufacturing skills. We want to resist foreign goods, and at the same time, we must revitalize our own industry. If we only advise people not to buy foreign goods, and we are still lazy and unwilling to work hard to do manufacturing work, that is like climbing a tree to catch fish. We must change the two words 'resist' to 'manufacture and resist'. Everyone bury their heads in work. People with industrial skills should engage in industrial manufacturing as much as possible. People with sales skills should try their best to promote the products of national goods factories. People with the ability to buy should buy national goods as much as possible. Then, even if we don't resist foreign goods, they will have no foothold in our market. Therefore, if the country wants to be revitalized, it is necessary to promote industry. If society wants to be consolidated, it is necessary to use national goods."</p>
<h3 id="e96">Entertainment and Gifts <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, those in the entertainment industry who voluntarily participated in the performance included Yi Fangshuo, Jiang Xiaoxiao, Fei Yanghua, etc., who performed comedy, which was quite wonderful. Mr. Pan Jinsheng's harmonica solo had a melodious tone and was very pleasant to listen to. Then, Zhao Zhongshan and Shen Chunlin performed magic tricks, and their movements were considered agile. Following that, all the members of the Chrysanthemum Society performed a new play with police workers, with profound implications and deeply touching. At the venue, the factories that donated products included China-Europe Candy Company's candy, Paris Cosmetics Factory's tooth powder, Yicheng Tobacco Company's exquisite round fans, Watson's and Yili Soda, and American Fresh Orange Juice Company's fresh orange juice. The meeting adjourned at around 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e97">3 Million Yuan of New Currency in Circulation on July 1st <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The alloyed color is excellent, and it will be inspected as it is cast in the future.</p>
<p>Certificates are printed quickly, and each box is affixed with proof of the alloyed color.</p>
<p>The Mint is waiting for the Ministry of Finance to order the casting of subsidiary coins.</p>
<p>Guowenshe reported that the Central Mint has completed a large batch of new coins. Now, it has been ordered to start circulating 3 million yuan from July 1st. The factory and the New Coin Review Committee have been actively working in recent days.</p>
<p>In preparation for circulation, the Central Mint, since being ordered to prepare for the casting of new coins, initially cast a small number. Later, due to their poor quality, the old molds were discarded and new models were used, removing the semi-circular sun shadow. From the new model to the present month, a large batch has been completed. Now, it is scheduled to issue 3 million new coins from July 1st to circulate in the market. In the future, they will be cast and issued at any time, and tested batch by batch. It is hoped that they will circulate throughout the country on the one hand, and gradually recover the old coins across the country on the other hand, until the old coins disappear completely and new coins are fully used.</p>
<p>At any time, the Central Mint hired engineer Ge Laide to come to China, and he has arrived in Shanghai to take charge of the testing work. At the same time, a testing office was also established in the New Coin Review Committee. All 3 million new coins have been tested, and the results showed that the alloyed color was completely consistent and even more excellent than expected. Therefore, a report will be submitted to the Review Committee in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>The circulation procedures for the 3 million new coins to be circulated have been packed into boxes. Now, the reviewers are rushing to prepare certificates, using both Chinese and Western languages, and stamped with the seal of Committee Chairman Kong Xiangxi, with one paper affixed to each box to prove its alloyed color. As for whether the issuance will be handled separately by the Central Bank or simultaneously by various banks when it starts at that time, it is still unclear.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Subsidiary Coin Issue <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to unify the currency system, intends to order the Mint to cast decimal silver subsidiary coins and first consult the Municipal Bankers Association for opinions. The association's reply to the Ministry of Finance has been recorded in previous reports. It is now heard that the Mint has not yet received the order from the Ministry of Finance. However, regarding the issue of decimal silver subsidiary coins, the Mint has planned to proceed and is currently waiting for the order from the Ministry of Finance before preparing to start casting.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Water Fee in the Public Concession <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>There will be another dispute.</p>
<p>Exceeding more than 20%.</p>
<p>Disconnection of water is unavoidable if no contract is signed.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that the British-owned Water Company previously charged water fees according to the new rate water meter system, which was 7.5% of the rent, exceeding more than half. The owners could not afford this extra water price and stopped paying the water fees, which led to a water disconnection storm. Later, Ping Bingnan took on the role of mediator and paid the water fees, guaranteed by Huayi. Where the water was disconnected, the company sent personnel to turn on the water, and the situation was slightly eased. The Water Company temporarily set a trial method: those with a rent of more than 125 yuan would be charged 7.5 cents per 1,000 gallons, and those with a rent of less than 10 yuan would be charged 1.71 cents per 1,000 gallons. However, even with the trial use to date, calculating at 7.5% of the original rent still exceeds half. According to reports from the Real Estate Association, some have a rent of more than 20%. The Water Company believes that this delay is not good, so it urged the owner representatives of the Real Estate Association to sign a new contract to make up for the losses. However, the owner representatives believe that this water price exceeds more than 30% and it is not convenient to immediately approve it. Meetings have been held repeatedly, but there is no solution. Currently, the company and the owners are brewing a dispute. According to news from the company, if the above situation is that the owners are no longer sincere in signing the contract, then the water disconnection problem is still unavoidable.</p>

<p>To rescue students studying in Japan.</p>
<p>= Forced to return to China this time, the situation is particularly pitiful.</p>
<p>The association has now expressed its willingness to provide assistance. =</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter yesterday to the Global Overseas Chinese General Association in this city, stating that Chinese students studying in Japan who have returned to China are impoverished and sick, and their situation is particularly pitiful, requesting the association to provide appropriate relief. It is heard that the association has now expressed its willingness to provide assistance after receiving the letter. The original letter from the Social Affairs Bureau is transcribed below. Dear Sir, This Bureau has received a letter from the Secretariat of the Municipal Government forwarding a petition from the Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Group who were expelled and returned to China, requesting economic assistance, etc., instructing us to investigate and handle it, and a copy of the original petition is attached. In addition, according to the report from the group's representative Wang Chengmo to the Bureau, the circumstances of the persecution and forced repatriation of colleagues by the Japanese side this time, as well as the reasons for the poverty and illness of 22 colleagues and the lack of avenues for appeal, requesting prompt relief. After reviewing the reported items, the situation is true and the matter concerns the suffering of overseas Chinese. Please check and hope that you will consider providing relief separately. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, June 28. It is also learned that the association's launch of relief for overseas Chinese in Mexico this time has gained the sympathy of overseas Chinese compatriots, and all sectors in this city have also praised it in unison, so there are quite a few people who are willing to provide assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e101">The Ministry of Railways Rectifies Joint Transportation <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Detailed measures are formulated.</p>
<p>Implemented on July 1st.</p>
<p>Since the Joint Transportation Office of the Ministry of Railways has been handling the joint transportation of goods between the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, it has achieved considerable results. However, the method of payment on arrival and the method of calculating transportation costs are of great importance. The Ministry of Railways has formulated a rectification plan and implemented it on time. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Joint Transportation Payment on Arrival Method <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways specifically telegraphed the Shanghai-Nanjing and Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration yesterday regarding the joint transportation payment on arrival method, stating that the payment on arrival method and joint transportation payment on arrival are of great importance and must be thoroughly implemented in order to provide merchants with as much convenience as possible. Otherwise, the freight transportation of each railway will not be able to fully develop, and the payment on arrival joint transportation should be actively carried out. After the implementation of the payment on arrival joint transportation, all freight charges received by the joint transportation railways must be actually collected and actually allocated. No payment should be deducted from the income from this joint transportation payment on arrival. Only then can the joint transportation payment on arrival be sustainable, and the Ministry's policy of developing freight transportation can be thoroughly implemented. After receiving the order, the Railway Administration shall order the Transportation and Accounting Departments to comply with it separately.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Method of Calculating Freight Charges <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways investigated that since the two railways and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration have been responsible for the joint transportation of goods, each joint transportation station has ignored the third decimal place when calculating freight charges, resulting in frequent errors of underpayment or overpayment when auditing freight tickets. In order to unify the method of calculating freight charges for the three railways and facilitate auditing, a standard calculation method has been formulated, and ordinary, premium, responsible, priority, and top priority items have been made into tables, compiled into a booklet, and distributed to the three railways for use, with July 1st as the implementation date.</p>
<h3 id="e104">All of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Marine engineers request a salary increase.</p>
<p>Same treatment as the driving department.</p>
<p>The bureau's reply has conditions attached.</p>
<p>All marine engineers on all ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have jointly requested a salary increase from the bureau due to unfair treatment by the bureau. Liu Hongsheng rejected the request, and the situation has become increasingly serious. The Board of Directors has accepted this matter for review. The reporter of this newspaper will record the details of the investigation as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Reasons for the Request <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The 25 ships of the bureau, both inland and ocean-going, employ a total of 80 marine engineers. Their wages are lower than those of the driving department on each ship. The marine engineers believe that the responsibilities of driving and marine engineering are equal among the crew members. British companies such as Taikoo and Jardine also treat personnel in both departments equally. Only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is particularly generous to the driving department's wages, while the marine department's wages are extremely meager. Now, at a time when the cost of living is rising, all marine engineers have unanimously decided to request an increase in wages in accordance with the driving department's wages, and have jointly signed and sealed a request to Manager Liu to handle it.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Status of Negotiations <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After all marine engineers submitted the reasons for the salary increase and the comparison table of the salary amounts of the two departments to the manager and the Board of Directors, Liu Hongsheng immediately summoned the marine engineers and stated to the public that the crew's wages were not set after he took office, but were drafted by the former head of the shipping department, Yang Ying, and it was difficult to approve the requested increase. If they were dissatisfied, they could do whatever they wanted. His words were quite suggestive of rejection. All marine engineers believe that this reasonable request, if the bureau does not increase their salaries, will definitely be submitted to the Ministry and the National Government to ask for a decision. The submission is already being drafted.</p>
<h3 id="e107">General Outline of the Original Submission <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>It is believed that although the driving and marine engineering departments have their own specialized duties, their ranks are equal. The treatment of the captain, first mate, second mate, and chief engineer, first engineer, and second engineer should be the same according to the shipping companies of various countries. However, our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company discriminates against marine engineering staff in every way and treats them unequally. Now, let's just talk about wages. The monthly salary of a Chinese captain ranges from 360 yuan to 500 yuan, the first mate from 160 to 190 yuan, and the second mate from 80 to 130 yuan, while the chief engineer is only 160 to 200 yuan, the first engineer only 100 to 130 yuan, and the second engineer 80 yuan. Compared, the injustice is extreme. According to the principle, the captain and chief engineer are equally responsible for the safety of the entire ship, and there is absolutely no difference in importance or rank. Now, the chief engineer's earnings in two months are less than the captain's earnings in one month. This is one reason. Moreover, since the colleagues took office, there has never been any accident or negligence in the marine engineering department. In addition, there are very few marine engineering schools, and there is a shortage of talent. If we do not advocate and encourage and increase wages, it may affect marine engineering talent. This is very important. Moreover, appointing the virtuous and enabling the capable is valued by the shipping industry. Now, this bureau has accumulated habits over the years, only focusing on the rank of the position, without distinguishing the merits of the talent. How can we clarify the standards of promotion and demotion and prevent the advancement of those who seek good fortune? Some colleagues have been serving in the bureau for seven or eight years, but their salaries are still the same. The current cost of living is very different from the past. With such a small salary, how can we support our families?

<p>Liu Hongsheng has implemented instructions for this matter, and has not outwardly rejected the request for a salary increase, but two methods have been stipulated: According to the bureau's regulations, the marine engineers must be tested according to their technical skills. Those who pass the exam will be given a discretionary salary increase. Those who only rely on experience and have no academic knowledge and cannot take the exam will be paid the original salary for the time being. The request for a universal salary increase cannot be approved. The instructions were unsatisfactory to all marine engineers and they have proceeded with the second step, submitting a public submission to the Ministry for appeal.</p>

<p>Because he must stay in Shanghai to review the new currency.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen will arrive in Shanghai in early August.</p>
<p>Zhongyang News Agency reported that Mr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Central Bank, was originally scheduled to take a plane to Pingjin yesterday morning to visit Mr. Yan Xishan and urge him to mediate the issue of the Chahar Province, so that the situation would not escalate and peace would be achieved as soon as possible. Mr. Kong stayed in Shanghai and did not leave due to business. The reporter of Zhongyang News Agency visited him at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon, and the conversation was as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Trip is Undetermined <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Kong, it is true that I have decided to go to the North to mediate the Chahar Province matter. It is difficult to decide when to leave, because the Central Mint's new currency has been decided to be issued on July 1st. Regarding the review of the new currency, I am humbly the chairman of the committee and cannot leave Shanghai immediately. Moreover, Minister Song has recently sent a telegram to Shanghai asking about the London World Economic Conference, so it is even more difficult to make the trip temporarily. As for Huang Shaogu, the representative of Feng Yuxiang, coming to Shanghai, I have absolutely no knowledge of it. It is rumored that Mr. Huang came to Shanghai and will visit me, which is not true at all.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen has been abroad for several months. Mr. Song has decided to leave England and return to China in mid-July due to the busy affairs of the Ministry of Finance. He can arrive in Shanghai in early August. If the World Economic Conference has not ended by then, then Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi and others will be responsible for the conference affairs. Bei Songsun, who went abroad with Mr. Song, may stay in England and delay his return to China.</p>

<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, received a letter from Philippine Governor Murphy yesterday, which was translated as follows: "Dear Sir, During this visit of my colleagues and myself to Shanghai, we were honored to receive various courtesies from you and the gentlemen of your chamber. Your kindness and hospitality were deeply appreciated, and we were also honored to receive beautiful flowers as gifts. All of this was a fortunate event for the travelers to be treated with such hospitality by the host. We left in a hurry and were unable to stay for a short period, which is regrettable. I believe that this is my first trip to the East, and I still need to study the situation in the East in order to understand it. However, there is one thing I can say, which is that in the future, regarding the promotion of Sino-Philippine trade or other matters that are beneficial to the mutual interests of China and the Philippines, if I can be of any assistance, I will certainly do my best."</p>

<h3 id="e118">Case of Tax Collection on Houses on North Szechuan Road <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Statement from the Municipal Finance Bureau</p>
<p>Striving for Fair Burdens for Citizens</p>
<p>Those Who Resist Taxes Will Be Dealt With According to the Law</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Municipal Finance Bureau issued a statement yesterday by the head of the bureau, Cai, in response to the opposition from various groups in Hongkou against the municipal government's collection of house taxes. The statement from the bureau's responsible official is as follows: This bureau is in charge of all tax revenue in the city, and strives to ensure fairness in the burdens borne by citizens. The current collection of house taxes in the North Szechuan Road area is originally intended to equalize the burdens of citizens. The reasons listed by the merchants and residents there are not sufficient. (1) Regarding the so-called issue of roads built beyond the boundary, which has been unresolved for a long time, the request to postpone the payment of house taxes is unwarranted. The recovery of roads built beyond the boundary is a comprehensive diplomatic issue. The government is currently conducting negotiations on this matter. How can it be unreasonably linked to the collection of house taxes as an excuse to refuse payment of house taxes? Moreover, even before the issue of roads beyond the boundary is resolved, other matters such as telephones have been resolved one after another. It can be seen that all matters that should be handled by this city will be handled in order, complementing the negotiation for the recovery of road rights. (2) Regarding the claim that the residents in that area are a mix of Chinese and foreigners, and that the municipal government's tax collection announcement only concerns Chinese citizens and not others, which is unfair, this bureau's collection of house taxes in that area does not exclude foreign residents. For example, the Yunfei Motor Company in that area, which is originally an American business, has also been levied house taxes for this quarter, which can serve as proof. (3) Regarding the claim that the issue of boundary disputes has not been resolved, the authority cannot be unified, and citizens' tax burdens are duplicated, this bureau will not collect taxes again from citizens in the area of roads built beyond the boundary who are currently paying house taxes to the special district due to the use of utilities in the special district. All areas where the city's police force has reached and those using utilities in the city will be subject to house taxes. The method is already fair. Moreover, after this city collects house taxes, this bureau will be responsible for ensuring that citizens do not have to bear duplicate burdens. There are many citizens in that area who understand the greater good and should comply with the regulations and pay taxes, fulfilling their obligations as citizens.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of house taxes in the section of roads built beyond the boundary on North Szechuan Road, the municipal government meeting has already decided to encourage citizens to pay. According to the person in charge of the municipal government, the municipal government has decided to collect the taxes and will not change its decision. However, the method of implementing the collection is still under consideration. Those who incite or instigate tax resistance will be dealt with according to the law. Good citizens will not be arbitrarily arrested. As for the responsibility of the head of the second branch of the fifth district, an investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Representatives of the Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Order to Stop the Newly Revised Tax Amounts</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association Joint Council is preparing to collect the newly revised fixed-amount tax on tobacco and alcohol by the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance starting from July 1st. It has specially sent six representatives, including Cao Gexian, Yu Xunlu, Dai Zhuoan, Jin Yunjie, Huang Wenqing, and Huang Yuming, to Beijing to petition relevant authorities. It is learned that the representatives have entrusted lawyer Li Sanwu in Nanjing to draft a petition, which has been submitted to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a prompt order to stop the tax. The original text states, "A petition regarding the Taxation Administration's preparation to illegally collect taxes on local tobacco and alcohol, requesting a prompt order to stop it to uphold national law and protect civil rights." Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the domestic tobacco and alcohol industry has been using the old monopoly system. For several years, merchants have had no inconvenience. It has recently been heard that the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance plans to abolish the monopoly system of salt and draft regulations such as fixed-amount taxes on local alcohol, and implement them on July 1st of this year. The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association Joint Council, as the matter concerns national laws and the rights of the people, has appointed Gexian and others as representatives of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou industry to petition in Beijing, requesting the suspension of implementation, and submitting a document for review. According to our country's constitution, which has not yet been enacted, the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage is the fundamental law of the country. Article 25 of the Provisional Constitution states that people have the obligation to pay taxes according to law. The term "law" refers to a proposal submitted according to a certain procedure, and the principles are decided by the political conference, transferred to the Legislative Yuan, and passed through the procedures of the Legislative Yuan, and announced by the National Government. The tobacco and alcohol monopoly system occurred before the promulgation and implementation of the Provisional Constitution, which is beyond question. After the promulgation and implementation of the Provisional Constitution, any state agency wishing to reform any tax must enact a law through the Legislative Yuan and implement it accordingly. The Taxation Administration drafted regulations to collect fixed-amount taxes on local alcohol, etc. Since it is a regulation, it should have gone through the legislative procedure. Since it has not gone through the legislative procedure, it can be known that it is not a legally produced law. Since it is not a legally produced law, no matter how cumbersome, repetitive, light, heavy, unbalanced, or imaginative the content of the regulations is, whether it is retroactive or strange, wanting to put all tobacco and alcohol merchants to death, it is practically impossible to implement. Since the basis is not a law, the people have absolutely no obligation to obey. Even if a law is legally enacted, the people can still consider their ability to pay taxes, state the facts from all sides, and provide opinions for the legislators' reference in advance. How can they ignore everything, work behind closed doors, want to replace the supreme law of the country with freely drafted regulations, and force the people to obey? Gexian and others, upholding the spirit of the rule of law, do not want the government to fall into injustice. They should truthfully state their attitude and report it. All tobacco and alcohol merchants in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou will not recognize the illegal fixed-amount tax on local alcohol and special tax regulations on local tobacco leaves drafted by the Taxation Administration this time, and request the Ministry to respect national laws and the rights of the people, and immediately order the suspension of implementation, so as to avoid accidents. In the event that the Taxation Administration ignores everything and insists on going its own way, and insists on forcing the collection according to the newly drafted regulations, then all tobacco and alcohol merchants in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou still have hearts and blood, unanimously refuse to pay, and insist to the end, not hesitating any sacrifice. I think the Ministry will be able to maintain the prestige of the country and the dignity of the law, and will not allow the Taxation Administration to act presumptuously and incite misfortune. Words are urgently presented, hoping to be adopted. The matter is urgent, and there is no time to choose words. Besides submitting separately, I respectfully submit to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance. Representatives: Cao Gexian, Yu Xunlu, Dai Zhuoan, Jin Yunjie, Huang Wenqing, Huang Yuming.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the issue of factory inspections in concessions, the municipal government and the concession authorities have previously discussed the principles of cooperation and reached an agreement. The municipal government has specially requested instructions from the Ministry of Industry in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible. It is learned that the municipal government has received a reply from the Ministry of Industry, but there are still unresolved doubts, so it has telegraphed the Ministry of Industry again for instructions. It is expected that the reply telegram will arrive in Shanghai within two or three days. The municipal government and the concession authorities will be able to continue negotiations next week.</p>

<p>Please Expedite the Clearing of Goods Confiscated by the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>And Return Non-Japanese Goods Confiscated by Mistake</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday stating: "Regarding the matter of petitioning, on the 25th of this month, the association held its fourth session of the members' representative meeting. The meeting discussed the proposal by Cheng Yujie and other representatives of the Chinese and foreign groceries industry, demanding that the goods of various industries that were mistakenly confiscated by the former Anti-Japanese Association be cleared and that the Confiscated Goods Clearing Committee of the former Anti-Japanese Association be ordered to expedite the return of the goods in order to show good faith and maintain capital. Please make a public decision." At the same time, the Paper Industry Association proposed that the domestic and Western paper goods of Yueshengchang, Xiexing, Dalun, and other paper shops have been mistakenly confiscated by the former Anti-Japanese Association for a long time and have not been returned. The General Assembly decided to approve the proposal and submitted it to your government, requesting a speedy clearing of the goods and a determination of the non-Japanese goods, which should be returned as soon as possible. It has been more than two years since the goods of various industries were mistakenly confiscated by the former Anti-Japanese Association. The capital of the merchants has suffered great losses. Although a Confiscated Goods Clearing Committee was established later, there has been no adequate solution so far, causing merchants to complain and have no way to appeal. This matter has been previously requested by the association and has not yet been approved by your government. It is appropriate to record the case and continue to submit it. Please examine and approve it, and grant a speedy order to the Clearing Committee to handle the matter as soon as possible and expedite the return of all mistakenly confiscated non-Japanese goods to maintain commerce. This would be for the public good."</p>

<p>Seizure of Narcotics Shipped from Shanghai</p>
<p>=Found Hidden in the Bottom of Tung Oil Barrels on the Japanese Ship Asama Maru</p>
<p>Narcotics Worth 300,000 Yuan=</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, details have arrived in Shanghai about the case in San Francisco, USA, involving the seizure of anesthetic narcotics shipped from Shanghai, totaling US$300,000. The case was uncovered on the night of the 2nd of this month. Acting on a tip from Chinatown, San Francisco customs officers boarded the Japanese ship Asama Maru immediately after it arrived at the port and found the narcotics hidden in the bottom of tung oil barrels. According to customs officers, six shipments have been secretly transported from Shanghai recently, this being the last. On the American side, there is an international smuggling ring led by Judah Ezra and Isaac Ezra, along with a Chinese-American surnamed Zhong. The tung oil was marked as being delivered to the Donaghe Lai Company, which is also a smuggling organization set up by the Ezras. Previously, U.S. federal investigators searched a warehouse on Kansas Street on May 19 after arresting the Ezra brothers, but the oil drums with the hidden narcotics had already been shipped out. Later, they thoroughly investigated the ship's shipping manifests and other related documents but found no clues. Therefore, the seizure of a large quantity of narcotics on the Asama Maru can be said to be a major achievement in the investigation. When searching the warehouse, a small printing shop was discovered, where the Ezra brothers were printing large quantities of sign paper marked with "Three Star Morphine," "Three Star Opium," and "Made in France." Also, according to Allied, the leader of the smuggling ring's San Francisco branch, the Ezra brothers initially sold on credit to intermediaries, giving them discounts. As business expanded in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas, they then moved on to promoting it in New York. He was arrested when he was about to go to New York to take on a new leadership role. In this incident, there were a total of eight tung oil barrels with hidden compartments on the Asama Maru, and 800 ounces of narcotics, worth a total of 300,000 yuan, were found in the bottom of two barrels. However, this is only part of the million-yuan shipment of narcotics. So far, nine people have been arrested, including two Chinese-Americans. There is also a Barris who is accused of attempting to transfer the eight barrels of tung oil with hidden compartments on the Asama Maru from San Francisco to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>11,000 Yuan Robbed</p>
<p>=Six Robbers Arranged Everything in Advance, Hired a Car to Wait</p>
<p>Unsuspecting Escort of Pig Trade Funds, Robbed by Surprise=</p>
<p>The Bodyguard Disarmed, the Old Clerk Powerless</p>
<p>The case of the 127,000-yuan robbery in the French Concession, which shocked the entire city, had just been solved by the police, when another huge robbery occurred yesterday afternoon at 2:40 PM in the Huiguan Alley on Limma Road in the Sixteen Pows of the South City. The victim was the Xiaodongmen Branch of the Bank of China, and the loss amounted to 11,000 yuan. Moreover, these robbers had arranged everything in advance. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Pig Trade Funds <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yong'an Lane on Limma Road in the Sixteen Pows of the South City, its front door faces Limma Road, and the back door is in the Huiguan Alley. Most of the residents in this lane are pig traders, and their business is very prosperous. The daily payment of funds is about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. However, these funds have always been handled by the Xiaodongmen Branch of the Bank of China, which sends personnel to the lane at about 2:00 PM every day to deliver the funds separately to the pig traders. In order to avoid accidents, each time the funds are delivered, a bodyguard is sent to escort them, which is a common practice.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Bodyguard Escort <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the bank sent funds as usual. However, because the bank had been notified by the pig traders in advance that there were no large amounts of funds to be paid out, the bank put 11,000 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars into a cloth bag and sent shop clerk Song Baiqing to deliver them. All the banknotes were five-yuan notes from the bank. Because Limma Road was under construction and the rickshaw could not pass, and the lane was also closed due to the construction, with everyone entering and exiting through the back door in the Huiguan Alley, the rickshaw driver Song Yunbiao was ordered to carry the cloth bag on his shoulder, led by Song Baiqing, straight to Xiangguajie, and then turn into Huiguan Alley to go to Yong'an Lane. The bodyguard Gao Shiyu escorted them along the way.</p>

<p>At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, two men, both around 30 years old, suddenly came to the Zhonghua Motor Company on Marlborough Road in the French Concession, claiming that they wanted to rent a car to go to the South City. The motor company dispatched a car driven by Xu Guobao, with city license number 4466 and concession license number 12662, for them to ride in. When they arrived at the open space opposite the Dada Wharf on the Outer Limma Road in the South City (because the area was being renovated), the two men ordered Xu to stop the car and told him to wait there. They got out of the car and walked to Limma Road, turned into Huiguan Alley, and met with four other men who were waiting there. They lingered on the side of the road, as if they were waiting for someone.</p>

<p>Among these six men, two were wearing white short shirts and pants, two were wearing blue silk long gowns, and the clothing of the others is unknown. When it was 2:40 PM, Song Baiqing, a shop clerk from the Bank of China, was seen turning into the alley from Xiangguajie, walking slowly. The men immediately gave a signal and swarmed forward. First, four men pinned down the bodyguard Gao Shiyu and took out pistols, threatening him not to make a sound. They took away the police whistle he carried, a white Langlin pistol, and nine bullets. At that time, Song and others knew they had encountered robbers and were stunned. Two robbers immediately rushed forward and forcibly snatched the cloth bag containing 11,000 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars from the rickshaw driver Song Yunbiao's shoulder. After getting the loot, they, together with the four robbers, ran quickly to the car that was waiting at the open space opposite the Dada Wharf. One of the robbers took out a pistol again, drove the driver Xu Guobao out of the car, and then they all got into the car and drove quickly south, with one of the robbers driving.</p>

<p>After the incident, Song Baiqing and others returned to the bank and reported to the manager. The manager immediately notified the First District Police Station by telephone. District Chief Guan Gong arrived with a large number of police officers, but because it had been a long time and the robbers were in a car and driving very fast, they could not be caught. They immediately reported the situation to the Municipal Police Bureau and ordered all district police stations to pursue the robbers. After being forced out of the car, the driver Xu Guobao returned to the motor company after his shock subsided and reported the situation. The motor company then reported to the Chinese and French police authorities, asking them to pay attention to the search for the stolen car.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at about 1:00 AM, the female tea server Ye Yu Shi and others from the Maya Second Silk Weaving Factory on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei sent a female worker named Han Shengxiang, 15 years old, from Shaoxing, to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road in the Public Concession. The doctor examined her and found that she was not suffering from a sudden illness but had an injury to her lower body. Medical treatment was ineffective, and she died at 1:40 AM. The female tea server and others were still at the hospital when the doctor called the Xinzha Police Station and had the accompanying female tea server and the deceased's female companions Wang Hefen, Qiu Guifen, Xue Meihua, and Qiu Genfen taken to the police station. According to the female tea server Ye Yu Shi, 44 years old, Wang Hefen, 19 years old, Qiu Guifen, 25 years old, Xue Meihua, 20 years old, and Qiu Genfen, 23 years old, all from Shaoxing, Wang Hefen claimed to have slept in the same room as the deceased. Qiu Guifen and Xue Meihua claimed that they were the guarantors of the deceased. They refused to reveal any more details. Later, the police chief and others found that the case occurred in the jurisdiction of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei. Therefore, at about 10:00 AM, they notified District Chief Lai of the district. District Chief Lai immediately ordered squad leader Wang Shifu of the Criminal Investigation Team to send detectives Fang Chaofu and Xu Jingen to the police station to bring back the thousand people. In the morning, a male foreman of the Maya Factory, Yu Heshu, 29 years old, was arrested at the Xinzha Police Station for inquiring about the female workers. He was also detained and taken to the Fourth District. When questioned, the foreman also refused to tell the truth, claiming that he did not know. District Chief Lai believed that the matter was now a suspicious case and that the procurator from the First Special District Local Court would have to verify the matter before questioning could begin. The body is now sent to the morgue to await verification. It is also learned that the deceased was a 175-numbered shuttle worker at the Maya Second Silk Weaving Factory and had no family in Shanghai, so she lived in the workshop.</p>

<p>Tang Jian, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, along with detectives Ma Zhongrong, Sun Jishan, Lu Gendi, and Bao Xia Yueshan, West Detective Chiefs Pei Naithol and Huamen, previously arrested thieves Zhou Guoliang, Kuang Haiqing, Kuang Liu Shi, Zhang Xinyun, Xiao Zicheng, Li Liu Shi, Zhang Yucheng, Li Xiaobai, Li Songde, Zhou Weifu, and suspect Wen Wei School Principal Xi Renken and female teacher Xia Wenying, a total of twelve people, at 62 Pushi Road and 6 Ganshi East Road in the French Concession, and confiscated eight pistols, five hundred and forty-six bullets, and three bombs. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Subsequently, the police found that the defendants had committed armed robberies at the homes of Li Rulong at 138 Fuxu Road, Li Deji at 25 West Suzhou Road, and Huang Muzhou at 39 Taian Lane on North Shanxi Road and 77 Disiwei Road, stealing property worth several thousand dollars. Kuang Liu Shi and Li Liu Shi had privately hidden explosives. Xi Renken and Xia Wenying had illegally hidden military firearms.

<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the continued interrogation. First, police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case, saying that during the adjournment, it was found that the defendants had also committed a robbery at the home of Diao Ge Shi, a woman at 34 Huaxing Lane, Yangshupu, stealing clothing and property. It was found that the defendants Kuang Haiqing and Kuang Liu Shi were tenants of Diao Ge Shi, renting the upper floor. On the night of September 23 last year, Kuang gathered several accomplices and roamed around at home. At 4:00 AM the next morning, they began to rob and then fled without a trace. The stolen goods have now been found in various pawnshops. Diao Ge Shi then testified that the Kuang couple were tenants and that they had gathered accomplices to rob her. When questioned, Zhou Guoliang, Kuang Haiqing, Zhang Yucheng, and Li Songde admitted to the robbery.</p>

<p>Police lawyer Li continued, "Since the police solved the case and confiscated a large number of firearms and bombs, a thorough investigation began to determine whether these people were politically involved. Although one of them was a member of the Blood Soul Extermination Group, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has now confirmed that they have political connections. In October of last year, the police arrested 23 people, including Long Lin, Tang Ming, and Wang Yunqiao. It was found that these people had participated in a plot to assassinate Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station in the summer of the previous year, which resulted in the shooting death of Secretary Tang Yuluh. In March of last year, when the Lytton Commission of the League of Nations came to Shanghai, Lord Lytton was staying at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, along with party and state dignitaries Gu Weijun, Mayor Wu, and others. These people opened room 511 in the hotel and plotted wrongdoing. All these cases were committed by these people. Now, Long Lin and others have confessed that the defendant Zhou Guoliang, whose real name is Qiu Jiliang, Zhang Yucheng, whose real name is Peng Guangyao, Li Shaobai, whose real name is Li Xiaobai, and Li Songde, whose real name is He Rong'an, are all involved in the above cases. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has sent officials today to submit the case and request permission to transfer Zhou and the other four. The police do not object, but they must be transferred after this case is concluded." Gao Wansheng, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, submitted an official document requesting the transfer of Zhou Guoliang, Zhang Yucheng, Li Xiaobai, and Li Songde for questioning. When questioned, Zhou and the other four admitted to the aliases and the plot to assassinate Minister Song. Finally, after a debate between the police lawyer and the defense lawyer, Judge Wu announced that the closing arguments for the case were concluded and that sentencing would be scheduled for the morning of July 4. Zhou Weifu was acquitted, and the other defendants were returned to custody. The request from the Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer will be considered on July 4.</p>

<p>Rickshaw Puller Gets Large Sum of Money and Loses It Again</p>
<p>Shi Changwang, a 34-year-old man from Taizhou, lives at No. 16, Alley 25, Xiaoshiqiao Street, outside Xiaonanmen, and makes a living pulling a rickshaw. On the evening of the 26th of this month at 11:00 PM, he rented a rickshaw and picked up a customer at the intersection of Shilu Road and Fourth Avenue in the British Concession. After pulling him to the intersection of Simon Road and Marlborough Road in the French Concession, the man gave him two dimes for the fare and left in a hurry. The rickshaw puller then discovered that the customer had lost a women's dancing purse in the carriage. He immediately took it home. Together with his landlord Liao Qiangjian, they opened the purse and suddenly saw 201 silver dollars hidden inside. They were overjoyed at this unexpected windfall and planned to embezzle the money. However, the news leaked out, and a group of hooligans nearby heard about it. They went to demand a share, but Shi and others refused. The hooligans held a grudge and secretly reported to the Third Precinct of the First District at about 10:00 PM the night before. Chief Jin of the precinct dispatched Police Chief Liu Maolin and Sun Shoushan to retrieve the money. However, Shi and others had already spent five dollars. The two Shis were arrested and taken back to the precinct. After a preliminary hearing, they were ordered to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to promote the export of domestically produced fruits, had its Guidance Department, including Ji Zejin, Guo Weibai, and Zhang Pansheng, convene various fruit merchants, such as Xie Mao and others in this city, to discuss sales methods. This was already reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, according to Mr. Zhang Pansheng of the Bureau, for various fruits that can be trialed for overseas sales, the fruit merchants will prepare a booklet. The Bureau has already categorized them separately and translated them into English, and has decided to first use Liverpool in the United Kingdom and Java, Singapore, and Little Luzon in the South Sea Islands as trial sales markets. The Bureau has already sent letters to various fruit merchants, requesting that they pack samples of various fruits into wooden boxes by a specific date, with explanations of their weight and shelf life. The Bureau will then collect and send them to consulates in the United Kingdom and Southeast Asia, which will forward them to various cities for trial sales.</p>

<p>= Allegations of Malfeasance During His Tenure at the Second Branch Prison</p>
<p>Former Warden Zhao Fengxian Also Arrested for Embezzlement =</p>
<p>Xie's Request for Bail Denied</p>
<p>Xie Fuci, the current warden of the High Court Branch and the Second Special District Court Prison, and concurrently the director of the civil detention center, was suddenly arrested by police dispatched by the First Special District Court Procuratorate on the orders of the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch Procuratorate the day before yesterday evening. It is rumored that it was due to</p>
<h3 id="e139">Suspicions of Inflated Prisoner Food Expenses <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>However, the circumstances are extremely serious, so after the prosecutor Zhong opened the court for interrogation, bail was denied and he was detained for further investigation. Whether he is guilty or not remains unknown at this time. Xie Fuci has previously served as warden in various counties in Zhejiang Province. On January 1, 1927, the Shanghai Mixed Court was abolished, and the Provisional Court and Court of Appeal were established. At the same time, the Jiangsu Second Prison Branch and Civil Detention Center were established. Xie was then transferred to Shanghai to serve as warden and director. Later, although the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special District Court and the Court of Appeal was reorganized into the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch,</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Heads of the Two Courts Changed Several Times <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Xie's position did not change. Until the year before last, the French Concession Mixed Court was also abolished, and the prison rights and judicial power of the French Concession were simultaneously recovered. Another Second Branch Prison and Civil Detention Center were established, and Xie was transferred to the French Concession to take office. The vacancy was taken over by Zhao Fengxian, appointed by the Ministry. Until last winter, the position was repeatedly changed. Zhao left and was succeeded by Huang Peibian, and Huang was succeeded by Lu Shaoxun. Lu had only been in office for two weeks when he was discovered by Shen Jiayi, the president of the High Court Second Branch, to have colluded with a</p>

<p>When Lu claimed the money, President Shen Jiayi of the High Court Second Branch discovered the malfeasance and immediately dismissed Lu and handed him over to the First Special Court Procuratorate for investigation. At the same time, he reported to the Ministry of Justice and appointed Sun Xiong to succeed him as warden and director. During the Procuratorate's investigation of Lu's malfeasance, it was also discovered that his predecessor, Huang Peibian, had also engaged in malfeasance. Because Huang's whereabouts were unknown, he could not be arrested. Huang's part was temporarily shelved, pending Huang's arrest and further interrogation. Lu and a certain guard chief, who jointly committed the malfeasance, were prosecuted according to law. After the first trial, they were sentenced, and Lu was sentenced to eight months. He appealed to the High Court Second Branch, but the result was rejected, so Lu Shaoxun is still serving his sentence in prison. Unexpectedly, Zhao Fengxian and Xie Fuci, the two officials who preceded Lu and Huang, had the prices of prisoner food reported during their tenure audited by the High Court Second Branch. Compared with the market prices at the time,</p>
<h3 id="e142">They All Underreported More and Overreported Less <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Shen, in order to clarify accumulated malpractices and to warn against future occurrences, decided to investigate severely to warn against corruption and encourage integrity. It was learned that Zhao Fengxian had been appointed as the warden of a certain county after leaving office. A telegram was sent to the county government to detain him immediately. It was reported that a telegram had been received informing them that Zhao had been detained. President Shen then, together with Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan, instructed Guo, the president of the First Special District Court, and Chief Prosecutor Wang, to dispatch police to the interior to transfer Zhao Fengxian back to the case for investigation. They also prepared an official letter and specially sent two bailiffs to the French Concession High Court Third Branch to</p>

<p>Xie Fuci. At 5 PM the day before yesterday, Liang Renjie, the president of the High Court Third Branch, summoned Xie to the court without revealing his intentions, showed him the arrest warrant, and immediately handed him over to the two bailiffs to escort him to the First Special Court. It was already 6 PM, and it was already past the usual closing time. However, an interrogation was required that day. Prosecutor Zhong ascended to the First Criminal Court and ordered Xie to be brought in for interrogation. After a while, Xie completely denied inflating food prices and requested bail. Zhong refused, saying that the case was serious and could not be clarified in a short time. He ordered the bailiffs to take him to the detention center for temporary detention. Since the establishment of the Second Prison Branch and the First Special District Court Civil Detention Center, the staff had changed five times. Except for the current Sun Xiong, who is clean, diligent, and devoted to his duty, the previous four members were either imprisoned or fled, and the circumstances of the cases were all the same. This is truly an unfortunate event in the judicial world.</p>

<p>Morrison Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>= Witness Proves Payment Made for Sulfite Cargo</p>
<p>Police Accusation of Embezzlement Cannot Be Established =</p>
<p>丨The Inside Story of This Case is Purely Political Manipulation丨</p>
<p>The Soviet Assistance Association at 2 Beijing Road is a branch of the Russian Central Consumer Cooperative. A Russian named Alexander Morrison is the director of the chemical products department of the association. In March of this year, the association shipped 298 tons of sulfite, worth 25,000 yuan, from Russia. Because there was no buyer, it was stored in the Maotai Foreign Firm warehouse. In mid-April, Xie Keming, the owner of Renji Paint Store at 1630 Guangdong Road, wanted to buy the goods. After Morrison contacted Xie several times, the transaction was completed on May 17. The association's manager, Maikefu, signed the warehouse receipt and took the goods away. However, Morrison suddenly disappeared, and Maikefu reported to the police that Morrison had embezzled the money. The police reported to the First Special District Court and issued a warrant for arrest. On June 13, Morrison suddenly surrendered to the General Patrol Room with his lawyer, Biao Fenling. The police detained him and sent him to the Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court questioned him. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the police were prosecuting him for embezzlement and forgery under Articles 357 and 243 of the Criminal Law, because the Association denied this sulfite transaction. The three letters of the Association contacting Renji were signed by the defendant and the accountant, Shi Lichen. Shi denied one of the signatures, claiming that it was forged by the defendant. Shi Lichen also surrendered, proving that one of the three letters was not signed by him and that the success of the transaction was unknown to the association. Maikefu testified that Morrison had told him that someone wanted to buy sulfite, but had to see the sample first in order to determine the price. Therefore, he signed the warehouse receipt. When questioned, the defendant stated that after the transaction was completed, Xie Keming signed a check and sent a bodyguard, Dong Yuqing, to accompany him in Xie's car. They first went to a money shop to get the money, and then went to the Association to hand over the money to Maikefu, and did not embezzle it. The court did not believe it and summoned Dong as a witness. Dong Yuqing testified, proving that the defendant's statement was true. The court then questioned the witnesses again and ruled that Morrison was not guilty. The police lawyer, Ru, stated that he would appeal. The court then ordered Morrison to be released on bail during the appeal period. It is said that the occurrence of this case was purely political manipulation, but neither party mentioned it during the court hearing today, so it cannot be published. After a detailed investigation, it will be reported later.</p>
<h3 id="e145">United States Silk Market Needs High-Grade Raw Silk <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Ordinary Grade Raw Silk Floods the Market, Making it Difficult for Chinese Silk to Gain a Foothold</p>
<p>To Open Up Sales Channels, High-Grade Raw Silk Must Be the Vanguard</p>
<p>丨Report by Miao Zhongxiu After Investigating in the United States丨</p>
<p>The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Branch and the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association jointly dispatched Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Inspection Department of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, to the United States to investigate the silk industry situation. When Mr. Miao passed by Japan, he sent a letter to Director Cai Wuwang, reporting on the recent situation of the Japanese silk industry. The essence of the original report was disclosed in the newspaper. Mr. Miao arrived in Seattle on May 22 and in Chicago on May 26. The director of the Raw Silk Inspection Institute accompanied him to visit spinning mills and hosiery factories near Chicago. He then reported the information he obtained in detail, which is worthy of reference for China's silk industry. Excerpts are disclosed again as follows:</p>
<p>Recent Trends in the American Silk Industry: The United States imports about 500,000 dan of raw silk annually, of which more than 50% is sold to hosiery factories, and the rest is purchased by various silk factories. In recent years, silk factories have used a large amount of rayon, and the raw silk they use is mostly medium-grade factory silk. However, hosiery factories use very little rayon, and most of the raw silk they use is high-quality goods. Therefore, hosiery factories play a very important role in the American silk industry. The trend of silk prices is generally optimistic. It has recently been raised to $1.75 per pound, and it is hoped that it will rise to $3. It is possible to reach above $2. There have also been many improvements in raw silk inspection methods and machinery. For example, in uniformity inspection, the 9-meter inspection (measuring uniformity by weight) has recently been adopted to supplement the black board inspection. The black board machine has also been improved and perfected, and an electric light inspection uniformity has been invented to replace visual inspection.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Failure of Chinese Silk and Its Rescue: Sales of Chinese silk in the United States have plummeted. From June of last year to May of this year, only over 10,000 bales were sold. Factories that used to buy Chinese silk have recently switched to Japanese silk. The reason is that the quality of Chinese silk is inconsistent. For example, the Purple Dragon brand of the Hangzhou Silk Factory was exclusively used by the largest hosiery factory in the United States several years ago because its uniformity was above 90 points. The silk stockings woven from it were very profitable. Factories competed to buy it, and demand exceeded supply. Later, Qianli Foreign Firm managed to buy 20 dan, and after other hosiery factories tried it, they were greatly disappointed. The inspection result was only 75 points of uniformity. At the same time, the first hosiery factory that purchased it also stopped purchasing it. However, American hosiery factories are still very willing for China to supply the highest-grade factory silk, that is, uniformity above 90 points, because the nature of Chinese raw silk is firmer, and the female workers are accustomed to paying attention to the strips, unlike Japanese female workers who pay attention to uniformity and ignore the strips. Often, the same 90-point raw silk can produce Chinese silk that is equivalent to 92-point Japanese silk. Therefore, if Chinese silk wants to open up sales channels in the United States, it must use high-purity raw silk as the vanguard to be able to save it. As for ordinary grade raw silk, it floods the market, and Chinese silk has no room to gain a foothold. This is what China's silk industry should be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="e146">New Beijing Steamer Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Strike Wave Appeased by Ningbo Seamen's Union</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, in the case of the strike of the Tai Gu Company's Nan Hua and other ships in Guangzhou, the Shanghai-Ningbo line's New Beijing steamer also experienced a strike at 5 PM the night before last. Fortunately, the Ningbo Seamen's Union sent personnel to persuade the workers of various departments of the ship, instructing them to continue sailing as usual until they received a reply from the Shanghai Union. The workers then moved the unloaded goods onto the ship and set sail at 7 PM, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning. According to the Taikoo Company, the report of more than 20 Taikoo steamships on strike for several days is not entirely consistent with the facts. It was found that the Guangzhou side was only due to the slowdown of dock workers, so the incoming ships could not load and unload goods. The sailors and stokers of the various ships have been guests of the company for many years, and their feelings are harmonious. They still serve as usual. The ship's employees are not on strike. Ships such as Shandong, Xinjiang, Jinan, and Jinhua have all returned to Shanghai one after another, which is proof.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association does not approve of the slowdown of the Guangzhou workers. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to the Guangzhou and Shantou Seamen's Unions to persuade them. The original telegram said, "Sent to Guangzhou and Shantou, and forwarded to the Ningbo Seamen's Union for your consideration. The bad habits of teahouses are known throughout the country. After the Taikoo limited salary system was ordered by the Party Department and the Ministry of Communications, it was implemented uniformly for Chinese ships. The Seamen's Union and shipping companies have always been very harmonious, and it is especially inappropriate to expand the situation due to teahouses. Please ask your chamber of commerce to find a way to eliminate it, and hope that your union will not go to extremes. Yu Hede, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association."</p>
<p>According to the New Beijing steamer, which was reported in the newspapers yesterday to have stopped sailing, with the workers and sailors unanimously slowing down work and moving the ship to the outer wharf to express their determination, the ship urgently stated that the ship has never been interrupted in its service between Shanghai and Ningbo, which shows that the New Beijing is still sailing as usual and no slowdown has occurred.</p>

<p>Axle Breaks, Derailment, Two Cars Collide Violently</p>
<p>= Platform and Other Places Damaged, Significant Losses</p>
<p>Fortunately, Passengers Were Not Injured, Traffic Was Interrupted for a Long Time =</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants' Tram Company's No. 47 car on the No. 3 circular route, which runs around the city, suddenly had a wheel axle break and derail at about 10:40 yesterday morning near Dadongmen, and then collided with No. 41 car on the No. 3 route, causing significant losses. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Axle Break, Derailment, Collision with Neighboring Car <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants' No. 47 circular tram on the No. 3 route was traveling from west to east at about 10:40 yesterday morning, and the passengers were still crowded. When it reached Dadong Station, the wheels suddenly vibrated and the car body tilted. All the passengers in the car were suddenly extremely panicked. The driver immediately stopped the car to check and found that the front wheel axle of the car had suddenly broken and detached, leaving the track. He immediately asked the passengers to get off the car and reported to the company, intending to drive back to the factory for repair. However, he still tried to drive. At first, it only made a creaking sound and there was no major problem. Unexpectedly, when it drove about 100 yards away from Xiaodongmen, No. 41 circular tram on the No. 3 route suddenly came from the opposite side on another track. At that time, the driver thought that the track was double-tracked and there was no relationship, so he continued to drive as usual, but he did not know that the wheel axle of the car had broken and was swaying while driving. Then, with a crash, the trailer of No. 41 and the front of No. 47 collided violently. At that time, No. 47 car was in danger of overturning and stopped immediately, but both cars were heavily damaged. Fortunately, no passengers were injured.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Inspecting Losses, Traffic Interrupted <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After the incident, the ticket sales drivers checked tickets and other items to inspect the destroyed items. The iron door of the trailer of No. 41 was completely destroyed, bent, and could no longer be used. The iron door of the platform of No. 47 car was also slightly damaged, the front iron plate of the car was completely damaged, the front headlight was broken, the road sign fell off, the floor of the platform was broken, several pieces of glass were broken, and other scattered items were lost, causing significant losses. However, because only the iron door of the trailer of No. 41 car was damaged, it continued to drive as usual. After the incident, in addition to reporting to the company to find a way to tow it back, the destroyed items were also sorted out.

<h3 id="e154">Dongmen Road Facing the River <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Ferry Extends Hours, Dispute Arises</p>
<p>丨Boatmen Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday Morning丨</p>
<p>The Dongmen Road ferry run by the Municipal Public Works Bureau has low prices and good facilities, so since its inception, the business of all sampans and ferries has been affected. However, the ferry runs from 5 AM to 10 PM every day, so after 10 PM, most passengers still hire rowboats. However, recently the Public Works Bureau extended the ferry hours to 12 PM, so the business of rowing boats is even more panicked. They filed an administrative appeal with the Municipal Government a few days ago, and petitioned the Municipal Government yesterday morning. The Municipal Government sent Zhu Weiyao, a staff member of the Second Section, to receive them, who promised to convey their suffering to the superiors, and instructed them to wait for the judgment based on the Administrative Appeal Law.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Public Security Bureau Announced a Warning Yesterday <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Responsibility for False Fire Alarms</p>
<p>Will Be Severely Punished for Crimes Endangering Public Safety</p>
<p>According to National News Agency, since the installation of automatic telephones in the city, the fire extinguishing associations have repeatedly received false fire alarm calls. They requested the authorities to investigate and deal with them strictly and find ways to stop them. After receiving the report, the Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice yesterday, saying, "Recently, unscrupulous people have been using automatic telephones to falsely report fire alarms, causing the fire extinguishing associations to run back and forth for no reason. This kind of behavior not only hinders fire prevention, but also disrupts public safety and should be strictly prohibited to maintain fire prevention and ensure local safety. In the future, if any of the above-mentioned situations occur again, once caught, they will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations on endangering public safety and will never be tolerated. In addition to ordering the various district teams to investigate and arrest them strictly, the public is hereby notified."</p>
<h3 id="e156">Taxpayer Association Sent a Letter to the Municipal Council <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Increased License Fees for the Restaurant Industry</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayer Association of the Public Settlement sent a letter to the General Office of the Municipal Council yesterday, saying, "Respectfully, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association, stating that Li Jinhai, the owner of Xinghualou, reported that he had received a letter from the Municipal Council, stating that from July 1 of this year, the license fee would be 140 yuan per quarter. It was found that Xinghualou originally paid 45 taels of silver per quarter, but it was suddenly changed to 140 yuan per quarter, an increase of more than double. At a time when the commercial and industrial economy is sluggish, increasing taxes will be difficult for merchants and people to bear. They requested that the matter be transferred for negotiation and prevention. It was found that this case was previously sent to your council for negotiation and prevention in May 1931. On June 1, 1931, your council replied, 'In reply, your letter of May 18 regarding the tavern license fee has been noted. The Municipal Council has not yet obtained our council's consent for the new regulations on the license fee. In addition to writing to the Municipal Council, requesting that the old regulations be followed, we are replying accordingly. We hope that you will investigate and take action.' Having received this, we ordered the members to investigate. The collection of donations and taxes in the Public Settlement should be effective after being approved by the Chinese Taxpayer Association. The Chinese and Western Taxpayer Associations should be treated equally, but we do not know whether this increase in donation has been approved by your association. If it has not been approved, please ask your association to find a way to prevent it in order to provide relief and alleviate the suffering. Please also inform us so that we can follow the rules. We also received a letter from the Shanghai Western Restaurant Industry Association, stating that the members of our industry association, such as Xin Licha Western Restaurant, reported to the association that on the 20th of this month, a letter was received from the Donations Office of the Public Settlement, stating that from July 1 of this year, the business donation (license fee) for Western restaurants would be increased to 140 yuan per quarter. We are afraid that this has not been widely known, so we are notifying you accordingly. We are shocked and ask you to convene a meeting quickly. Our association immediately convened a meeting of all the members of our industry and discussed and resolved that since the city was affected by the January 28 War, not only has the national vitality not recovered, but the suffering of the citizens is even deeper. All industries are in decline and the market is deserted, especially our industry. As a result, many businesses have closed down and ceased operations. Our members already feel unable to bear the various donations and taxes that they previously owed. Now the Donations Office of the Municipal Council does not observe the business situation, does not understand the people's sentiments, and suddenly increases the business donation (license fee) from 45 taels of silver (63 yuan) per quarter to 140 yuan, which is more than double the original amount. Such harsh taxes are difficult to bear. If we do not ask the various agencies and public organizations in the city to assist in exempting us from the additional donations, we can only wait for death. Based on this, our industry association is especially asking your association to uphold justice, argue on the basis of reason, and ask the Donations Office of the Municipal Council to withdraw its order, exempt us from the additional donations, and maintain the difficulties of the merchants and show fairness. Please reply to us, and we will appreciate it. Since the city of Shanghai was invaded by enemy troops, it has been in a very desolate state, which is a fact that no one can deny. The restaurant industry is a wealthy business, which is known to everyone with common sense. This is a matter of fact and it cannot increase its burden. Furthermore, the taxpayers' meeting decided that taxes should be increased this year. This is a matter of law and it cannot increase its burden. Taxes should be sought from profits. There is no reason to drain the pond to catch the fish. Now, the restaurant industry is having difficulty maintaining its business operations and expenses. Not asking for a reduction in donations already shows a deep understanding of the overall situation. Increasing the burden again goes against the principles of taxation. Based on the letter above, we are respectfully asking your bureau to reconsider and not make the industry worse off."</p>
<h3 id="e157">Travel Business License Tax <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Agrees to Exempt Half of the Increase</p>
<p>Industry Colleagues Express Reluctant Acceptance</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession notified the increase in the travel business license tax, it has aroused opposition from colleagues in the industry. The Shanghai Travel Business Association led the organization of the Shanghai Travel Business Anti-Public Concession License Tax Increase Committee. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Now it is learned that since the establishment of the association, it has been actively working. First, it sent detailed letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, explaining the current business situation and the reasons and facts for the difficulty in increasing taxes, seeking assistance. Then, Sun Qiuping, Chen Wenda, Xu Wenzhao, Zhang Yichen, and Yao Songnian were sent to the Municipal Council's Donation Office to argue based on reason. After a long debate, the council agreed to temporarily reduce half of the increased amount for the autumn and winter seasons of this year. However, starting next year, the full increase would still be required without any reduction. The representatives expressed deep dissatisfaction with the continued increase next year and requested assistance from Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Lvdeng, as well as Mr. He Dekui from the Municipal Council's Chinese Affairs Office. After negotiations between Yu, Yuan, He, and the Municipal Council, the council agreed to collect half of the increased amount from now on, without a time limit. The association considered the matter to be of great importance and whether to accept it would require a decision by the general assembly. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., a general assembly of colleagues was held at the Jiangsu Hotel in Ziyoufang, Guangdong Road. Chairman Sun Qiuping presided over the meeting. After discussing the matter, it was decided to reluctantly accept the half-reduction plan and to abolish the Anti-Tax Increase Committee organization from now on. However, it was hoped that the Municipal Council would restrict the issuance of travel business licenses to avoid excessive increases in the number of colleagues and maintain business. Deep gratitude was expressed to Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lvdeng, He Dekui, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association for their strong support. At that time, travel businesses that had not joined the Travel Business Association were moved by the association's leadership in leading the industry, sparing no effort, and vigorously defending legal rights. Therefore, they requested to join the association one after another.</p>

<p>New Contributions from the Tea Improvement Farm</p>
<p>| Invention of Tea Making Machinery |</p>
<p>The Tea Improvement Farm, jointly established by the Shanghai and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry, is located in Baipengkeng, Xiushui, Jiangxi. Since its opening in April this year, it has been actively carrying out its duties. It is now reported that the farm's first tea has been transferred to Shanghai. Major tea merchants and tea-buying foreign firms have evaluated the color, aroma, and taste of the black tea, and all are excellent. The best can be compared with Indian and Sri Lankan black tea, and the second best is not inferior to Qihong. The farm, considering that the original equipment was not very complete, has spared no effort in improving and researching tea-making machinery. In addition to the green tea machinery designed and manufactured by Commissioner Wu Juenong and Commissioner Fang Hanzhou, which has been transported to the farm for trial use and has achieved excellent results, the farm's director, Mr. Yu Haiqing, and technician, Mr. Feng Shaoqiu, have designed and manufactured a type of black tea withering machine. It uses a circular cylinder made of copper wire mesh, installed on an iron frame at a suitable angle, with a fan placed below to pass hot air, so that the temperature inside the cylinder is maintained at around 45 degrees Celsius. The fresh leaves fall into the cylinder from the funnel opening and rotate freely. After sensing the temperature, the leaves become soft and automatically flow out from the tail of the machine, which is extremely convenient. The machine was tested on-site on the 14th of this month. The withered leaves were no different from those dried in the sun. If this is the case, the difficulty that China has had for many years in not being able to manufacture black tea in rainy weather will be solved once and for all.</p>

<p>丨Top British Player丨Beaten by South African Fagua Sheng</p>
<p>(Reuters dispatch from London, 27th) Today is the second day of the Hulbert Deden grass court tennis tournament. The weather is mild, and the number of spectators is quite large. Unexpected events also occurred today. The top British player, Panley, was eliminated by the young South African Fagua Sheng, which was a great surprise. Vanse was also nearly defeated by the young northern England player England. Austin eliminated Browning from France, but Panley was unexpectedly eliminated.</p>
<p>Noah, a young South African from Cambridge University and a student of Fagua Sheng, created a sensation today. In the second week of the men's singles, he defeated the top British player Panley with scores of 7 to 5, 6 to 1, 3 to 6, 4 to 6, and 6 to 4.</p>
<p>Panley was at a Loss. Fagua Sheng's ball skills are astonishing, with powerful serves and heavy forehand and backhand shots. In the first and second sets, he constantly advanced to the net, applying pressure, and then finished with heavy shots, leaving Panley at a loss, appearing like a second-rate player.</p>
<p>Forcing the Enemy to Retreat. In the second and fourth sets, Panley took full advantage, and his cross-court shots were successful, preventing Fagua Sheng from approaching the net. However, in the final fifth set, the South African youth repeated his previous technique, forcing his way to the net and blocking Panley's sharp return shots.</p>
<p>Dramatic First Set. Fagua Sheng took an early lead with a score of 3 to 0, but Panley tied it. Fagua Sheng then used an amazing overhead smash to make it 5 to 3. In the final point of the set, he lost it due to a foot fault. At 5 to 4, he lost three consecutive points after Panley retook it, making it 5 to 5, and eventually lost 5 to 7.</p>
<p>Stephen Wins Against Bu Jing</p>
<p>The match between the young American and Japanese players, Stephen and Bu Jing, was the most exciting, attracting many fans. It lasted for two hours. Stephen, at six feet seven inches, is the tallest player in this year's Suborton and also the most handsome young man. His serve is terrifying, and his half-volley shots are wonderful. At the same time, Bu Jing also showed his beautiful backhand shots. In the end, Stephen won against Bu Jing with scores of 9 to 7, 2 to 6, 9 to 7, 1 to 6, and 6 to 2. Also, the Japanese player Sato won against former South African Heavyweight Boxing Champion Harris with scores of 6 to 3, 6 to 3, and 7 to 5.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Nudism</p>
<p>By Baihe</p>
<p>Some say that clothing serves the purpose of "warding off cold" and "warding off heat." Therefore, in cold weather, one should wear "wool" to ward off external cold, and in hot weather, one should wear "flannel" to ward off external heat. Others say that humans inherently possess the "ability to resist cold and heat." In ancient times, our ancestors did not wear clothes or hats, yet they lived for two or three hundred years. Later, when people started wearing clothes, human skin became unable to withstand the invasion of sunlight and rain, and "resistance" gradually declined, leading to a shortening of human lifespan. Both theories have "irrefutable" reasons, yet they are fundamentally "contradictory."</p>
<p>Some say that clothing signifies "humans are not beasts," hence the understanding of etiquette and the wearing of clothes and hats. Police officers arrest "bare-chested individuals," fining them two yuan and providing them with a undershirt to warn them against "offending public decency." Smoking or spitting in trams is blatantly disregarded despite strict prohibitions, but "bare-chested individuals," though not explicitly "forbidden from riding," are often chased off by ticket sellers because they are too "uncivilized." Others say that concealing sexual organs within clothing creates an inexplicable mystery around the "reproductive organs," which are merely one of the organs on the human body alongside "ears, eyes, mouth, and nose," leading to all kinds of "sexual" sins. If everyone were naked, with everyone having sexual organs just as everyone has ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, no one would be surprised. Both theories are "well-reasoned," yet fundamentally "contradictory" and incomprehensible.</p>
<p>In recent years, thanks to the influence and education of "foreigners" and "upper-class Chinese," everyone has gradually come to understand the grand principle that "nudity" is not only "unhygienic" but also "utterly uncivilized." However, the "nudity movement," promoted to "increase the body's resistance" and "eliminate the mystery of sexual organs," is spreading from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Amidst these "extreme" yet "unique" theories, should we "well-dressed" Shanghainese be "decently attired" or "stark naked"? It is indeed a matter of much hesitation.</p>
<p>The Third Great Event</p>
<p>By Zhen Xun</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Committee, recently spoke at the 6th graduation ceremony of Central University, representing the Central Party Headquarters. He mentioned Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, urging people not to seek high office but to accomplish great deeds. He then analyzed the major events of the time, stating that besides the two major issues of resisting Japan and suppressing bandits, a third major event had arisen. The thousands of listeners in the Central Auditorium could not immediately figure out what the third major event was, until, after a considerable pause, he revealed that it was the problem of flood control. Currently, floods are frequently reported, and disasters are looming. Rivers are already lapping at the banks, which is the most eye-catching event in the newspapers!</p>
<p>This third major event is not only a concern for our well-being but also the greatest fatal wound to this dying nation! Because floods are not only merciless but also devoid of any rationality. One can still seek peace with the enemy, but there is no possibility of compromise or surrender to floods. If the floods create a situation of collapse and inundation as they did in 1931, enacting the second act of tragedy, then China, no matter how large, and its people, no matter how numerous, will probably be unable to withstand such turmoil again. Four hundred million people—this is the old statistic. The actual number today, when truly calculated, will certainly be considerably discounted. Whether this discount will become even smaller in the future is something only heaven knows!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Chinese people possess the spirit of "making big things small." As the saying goes, "Turning big problems into small ones, and small problems into nothing." There are probably quite a few people with such skills today. As long as someone "enlightens" them, why be alarmed? Suppose this third major event occurred last year as well, and the National Crisis Conference designated it as one of the three major issues. By the time the conference closed, hadn't it already been forgotten? What kind of major event is this? Perhaps the newspapers are exaggerating!</p>
<p>The Arrogance of a Traitor</p>
<p>By Wang Yu</p>
<p>Those assembled in Changchun after the September 18th Incident are invariably labeled as traitors or puppets in our writings; even calling them "pseudo" is considered the most calm and rational approach. However, these figures are quite arrogant themselves. People like Zheng Xiaoxu compare themselves to meritorious ministers of the restoration or founding fathers. Xi Qia even said to others, "Who is the traitor? Wait and see in half a year!" Meaning that they are genuinely building a nation and will have achievements to show in half a year, without compromising any sovereignty. Those who claim to save the nation while secretly betraying countless national rights are the real traitors! This was naturally said by the chief puppet, Puyi, shortly after arriving in Changchun. Later, the reality turned out to be completely different. Xi Qia could not help but resent Japan for going back on its word, but he could not speak it out and could only harbor the resentment in his heart forever. I once saw several old newspapers published outside the customs that happened to contain two heptasyllabic poems by Zheng Xiaoxu. One was "Celebrating Chen Baochen's Birthday," which read: "Heaven turns the desolate desert into a divine capital, the elder statesman's arrival from the east startles the world. At eighty-five, he is truly a hero, seeing the elders on the half-month of the Double Ninth Festival. The strategy of restoration relies on long-term plans, the heroes of the north await the alliance of the leader. The fine cursive poems occasionally emerge, knowing the duke does not diminish the old sentiments." The other was "Thoughts on the Double Ninth Festival," which read: "In my prime, I still remember being exiled to the southern wilderness, escaping to the empty tung tree and cherishing my graying temples. How can I willingly be a forgotten elder in self-imposed exile? Who will share my soberness on this Double Ninth Festival? Chrysanthemums are not seen, autumn is colorless, the geese's messages are always late, the sea has become a mulberry field! Surely there are remnants of the previous dynasty thinking of their old master, climbing high and trying to call to the heavens." How arrogant it is! Not only does he call himself an "elder statesman" whose "arrival from the east startles the world," but because he "cannot willingly be a forgotten elder in self-imposed exile," he anticipates that "surely there are remnants of the previous dynasty thinking of their old master." In reality, who other than old fools like Zheng Xiaoxu has Puyi in their minds? Some also say that Zheng Xiaoxu and his ilk initially regarded Japan as the Khitans, thinking that Shi Jingtang could easily be emulated. Who knew that in reality, they were not even as good as Liu Yu. Liu Yu was made emperor by the Jin people in the fourth year of the Jianyan era of the Song dynasty, with the state name of Great Qi, and the capital at Daming Prefecture. He repeatedly led the Jin people to invade, but it was unsuccessful. The Jin people disliked him and eventually deposed him. But Liu Yu still illegitimately held the throne for eight years and was much more free and happy than Puyi. How could Puyi compare to Liu Yu?</p>
<p>Deep Water, Scorching Fire—A Desperate Situation for the People</p>
<p>By Zhurongshi</p>
<p>The scorching sun is pressing down, and summer is fearsome. The earth's temperature gradually soars with the thermometer. These days, fashionable terms like "summer retreat" and "escaping the heat" are coming into use. Places like Guling, Putuo, and Moganshan are now filled with many people's footprints. The coolness and tranquility of the mountains can indeed alleviate the heat, but for us poor commoners, who struggle to make ends meet, we can only endure the scorching of the Red Emperor and sigh at the mountains!</p>
<p>"As fire deepens, as heat intensifies," this is the saying of ancient sages used to describe the suffering of the people. Unfortunately, in today's society, this is perfectly accurate. Countless innocent people are being buried in water and fire. This year, the terrifying floods are already before our eyes. Floods are rampant everywhere, and countless people in various provinces are trapped in the mud. It is said that in the Jiujiang area, the floodwaters have risen sharply, and many people are fleeing to Mount Lu to escape the floods. Even families with some means are helping the old and carrying the young to climb the mountain. The famous resort for escaping the heat has been transformed into a place for escaping the flood, which is extremely ridiculous. However, the poor commoners look at the high mountains but cannot climb them, suffering immensely. The administrative authorities should consider how to help the people escape from water and fire and reach a place of comfort and safety. This is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed for a moment.</p>
<p>He Jian, the chairman of Hunan Province, gave a very poignant speech about the floods. He said: Natural disasters are inevitable throughout history and in all countries, but according to the comments of ancient Chinese scholars, natural disasters are related to the virtues of the ruling authorities. Therefore, he believes that the floods in Hunan Province are due to his own lack of virtue and his inability to inspire auspiciousness and eliminate the disasters. He feels extremely ashamed. We certainly express our admiration for Chairman He's remarks, but the blood of humans is too cold. If everyone could feel shame when faced with problems, the country would not be in such a terrible state. Alas! The commoners in deep water and scorching fire will soon be wiped out.</p>
<p>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</p>
<p>By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Hearing the Words Alarms the Fair Heart, Vain is the Hope of Ennoblement; Listening to the Songs Reveals Yearning, Idle is the Body Serving the Country</p>
<p>Guizhi said, "Isn't everyone like this? I don't smoke either." Old Mother Liu said, "Your mother smokes." Guizhi said, "She can only afford to smoke a little Guandong tobacco leaf." "I don't like the smell, so my mother doesn't smoke anymore." As Old Mother Liu spoke, she became more intimate. She sat down on a broken chair by the pit, nodded, and said, "It's not easy for you two to live like this. I heard a family moved into the backyard next door. What do they do?" Guizhi thought to herself that this was her chance and said, "It's a company commander." Old Mother Liu said, "Another soldier. Do they have children?" Guizhi smiled and said, "He doesn't have any family yet. An old man and a servant live there. The company commander comes back every few days, but it's very quiet." Old Mother Liu said, "How old is the old man?" Guizhi said, "Probably over sixty, right?" Old Mother Liu sighed and said, "Why would he let his son be a soldier at such an old age?" With just this sentence, there was no need to ask anything else. It was clear that Old Mother Liu was completely dissatisfied with being a soldier. She smiled and said, "It's not easy to rise from a soldier to a company commander. He relies on his son for food, drink, clothing, and housing. What do you mean by saying it's not good?" Old Mother Liu said, "Of course, it's not easy to rise to the rank of company commander. But if a soldier rises to this level, he's probably held his head in his hands countless times. That's why I say don't let your son be a soldier." Guizhi was just about to ask a question when she heard someone cough lightly outside the window. Old Mother Liu smiled and said, "Is that Mr. Niu? Please come in, I have something to ask of you." She said as the coughing sound came from outside the door again, and then that Mr. Niu walked in. Guizhi saw that he was an old man nearing sixty. He was wearing an iron-gray cotton robe with a row of unbuttoned buttons at the hem. He was wearing a black cotton mandarin jacket over his upper body, also with the chest open. Here, one could see countless oil and wine stains and burn marks on the chest of his cotton robe. He was wearing a three-piece leather hat, but the word "leather" was only in name, as the leather had been damaged by wind, snow, and moths, looking like water-stained cotton. Both cuffs were covered in grease like plaster. (114)</p>
<p>Brief News</p>
<p>Hong Jun, an antique enthusiast in the old capital, has moved his collection to Shanghai to avoid the turmoil. He has opened Shanlin at the intersection of Sanma Road and Guangxi Road. On the opening day, an exhibition was held, featuring exquisite bronzes, porcelains, calligraphy, paintings, and inkstones. There is a screen made of ivory and actual stones inlaid with the Four Beauties and Sixteen Sons, an ivory-inlaid jade rosewood cabinet, and eighteen tri-colored Arhats, all relics of the old palace. They are extremely precious. The calligraphy and paintings include landscapes by the renowned Qing painter, cursive scripts by Yang Jisheng, landscapes by Huang Shangu, and hand scrolls by Xinluo Shanren, Ruan Yuan, and Tang Yin. There are also a large number of Han jades, as red as blood, mostly well-known masterpieces from the old capital.</p>
<p>A Constant Business for Small Craftsmen and Small Capitalists</p>
<p>By Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Recently, I have been asked for advice by many who are worried about unemployment and want to start small industrial businesses. I have been devising various plans to enable those who are currently unable to work to engage in a constant business in a short period of time, which can not only benefit themselves but also benefit others. In my opinion, the most stable option is to engage in the business of stationery and envelopes. With a deposit of only two hundred yuan, one can secure an exclusive area, without worrying about encroachment from latecomers. Even if one becomes tired of running the business and no longer wishes to continue, the original capital can still be recovered. Moreover, even if there is no business at all, one can still receive a monthly interest of one percent, providing some income. This is almost unparalleled in terms of capital stability. However, the method of allocation in terms of equipment should be as described below to avoid depletion.</p>
<p>㈠ For those who have no experience in stationery and envelope production, it is advisable to hire an experienced worker from a traditional paper shop, known as a "yi ba lian" worker. The so-called "yi ba lian" worker is capable of all four types of production: stationery, envelopes, notebooks, and ledgers, including printing, binding, and cutting. They are mostly apprentices who have become skilled workers. Printing only requires wooden blocks, paper cutting uses a drag knife, and ledger binding uses thread. All of these can be done without machines, but with some improvements to achieve machine-like printing. Paper shops can be asked to introduce such workers, and there will be no shortage of candidates. The monthly salary is generally from ten to sixteen yuan, and the cost of food and lodging will not exceed eighty cents per day. Taking letter paper as an example, the usual cost of sending it out to be printed is four jiao per thousand sheets. If one hires a worker to print it themselves, they can print an average of four thousand sheets per day, costing only two jiao per thousand sheets, which means one can earn eight jiao per day. After deducting pigments and consumables, one can earn at least twenty yuan per month. If two people work, they can earn forty yuan.</p>
<p>㈡ Wooden blocks can be carved locally at carving shops and do not necessarily require lead plates, as wooden blocks can also be printed with ink, producing the same quality as lead or stone printing. However, in the beginning, for the sake of the worker's familiarity, one can start with woodblock watermarking, which is already sufficient. Stationery can be distributed through ordinary eight-line businesses and sold by small shops on consignment. The procedure for ledgers is more complicated and is a good home-based industry. For example, workers can focus on printing and cutting, while folding and binding can be done by women and children. Envelopes can be sent out for lining, and workers can teach women and children how to fold them, which they will soon be able to do proficiently. If a family of five is originally idle, now each person can earn an average of two jiao per day, amounting to thirty yuan per month. Adding the worker's production, the surplus profit can also be twenty yuan, meaning that hiring only one person can yield a monthly income of fifty yuan. If one were to seek a monthly salary of fifty yuan elsewhere, it would be difficult to obtain and would be subject to loss because one would not have control, making it not a constant business. Therefore, one should encourage oneself with perseverance in this business to achieve success.</p>
<p>㈢ There are no restrictions on the type of paper used, but using paper that is larger in size and thicker in texture is more cost-effective than using ordinary Lianshi or Maobian paper. For example, ordinary Lianshi paper is 25 x 44, yielding only seven thousand 7 x 11 letter papers per ream. Liyong Lianshi paper is 28 x 44, yielding eight thousand sheets. When lining envelopes, two layers can be equivalent to three layers, twelve households can yield fifteen, fifteen households can yield eighteen, and eighteen households can yield twenty, and twenty-four households can yield twenty-eight, all of which are more than ordinary paper. When cutting, all yi ba lian workers can do it. The size of Liyong Maobian paper is also larger than ordinary paper, with ordinary paper being 25 x 52 and Liyong paper being 30 x 55. This is useful for making ledgers, allowing for a good fit without waste. (All the above dimensions are in inches.) Moreover, those who manage Liyong stationery and envelopes can return unused Liyong factory paper when purchasing it, making it more stable than any other industry.</p>
<p>㈣ The first month is entirely for preparation and production. To solicit orders from the outside, one can first purchase fifty or sixty yuan of Liyong office stationery and envelopes in stock, along with the original reams of paper as follows: (A) Five reams of 28 x 44 yuan-character Lianshi paper. (B) Five reams of 30 x 55 natural-color Maobian paper. (C) Two reams of 30 x 55 white Maobian paper. (D) Two reams of 30 x 44 lake-color newspaper. (E) Two reams of 28 x 44 Haiyue paper. The paper listed above is used for (A) printing stationery, (B) printing ledgers, (C) printing Ruyi stationery, and (D) and (E) lining envelopes, with two layers equivalent to three layers, or using two layers of (A) and one layer of (B). With the above allocation, one can have enough to work with. If there are any items with a specific brand name to be printed that one cannot print themselves, one can ask the Liyong office on the third floor of the Dalu Commercial Market to print them on their behalf, which should not be difficult.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Goods Weekly Summer Supplies and Consumer Psychology</p>
<p>By Yang Yan</p>
<p>The first priority for national goods factories is to cater to consumer psychology. If the products do not suit consumers' tastes, no matter how much you advertise or how cheap they are, they will not be very effective. The representative of consumers can be considered the housewife. Housewives hold the power of purchasing for most families. Therefore, it is better to cater to the psychology of general housewives than to cater to the psychology of consumers. Housewives are representatives of consumption, and all discerning housewives are constantly studying the trends of market products, material selection, and paying attention to the shifts in general psychology. Sometimes they have the task of guiding manufacturers to improve their products, and sometimes they have the task of guiding general consumers in their choices. Therefore, from the perspective of manufacturers, it is best to constantly pursue consumer psychology and keep up with it, without letting go in the slightest. Only then can products improve and sales be brisk. One day, I was chatting with Mr. Fang Yexian, and he said to an employee of the China National Goods Company, "I see that there are many women in the market wearing clothes with large floral patterns. We should pay attention to this." I admired these words from Mr. Fang because he was constantly using his mind to consider the psychology of general consumers. One day, the National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, through the introduction of Mr. Zhang Yujiu, invited Mrs. Yu Yingjie to come and talk. Mrs. Yu is a housewife who is enthusiastic about national goods. She grew up in the United States and has lived in Shanghai for a long time. Throughout her life, she has been dedicated to the study of products and consumer psychology. The first thing she said was that the production of national goods must conform to consumer psychology. Remaining unchanged is the biggest taboo. Taking clothing as an example, Americans follow the French, always one step behind. For example, when large floral patterns are popular in the United States, striped patterns are already popular in France. If we do not study this, not to mention being behind in everything and having stagnant goods, how can we gain a foothold in the international market? She also said that the Chinese people think that cheap prices are the best they can do, but if the price is cheap but the material is not good, consumers will also turn away. In fact, some people do not care about cheap prices, but rather about durability and exquisiteness. She hoped that national goods factories would pay attention to this point and that shoddy production would ultimately fail. These words are truly golden rules.</p>
<p>I will now discuss summer supplies based on Mrs. Yu's words. Summer supplies boil down to six words: ㈠ Fashionable No matter what kind of product it is, the first priority is to be fashionable. Unfashionable products can only be placed in antique preservation societies as displays of antiques. Sometimes, putting them in the middle of other products will reduce the sales power of those products. Therefore, the first priority for manufacturers is to innovate and constantly study market trends, keep up with them, and avoid falling behind.</p>
<p>㈡ Color The second priority for summer supplies is color. Summer is hot, and the most taboo is eye-catching, glaring colors. Therefore, simple, elegant, and quiet colors are the most pleasing and the most popular.</p>
<p>㈢ Clever and Convenient Cleverness is an element of any product, but it is especially suitable for summer products. Summer rooms should be spacious, so the volume of items should not be bulky and take up space. Summer individuals should be light, so the style of items should not be cumbersome and difficult to carry. If you understand this point, you can win customers' welcome and consumers' satisfaction.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have published this special issue of summer national goods supplies. Many articles can be used as a reference for manufacturers and consumers. I hope everyone will provide practical guidance.</p>
<p>My Summer Supplies</p>
<p>By Hanmei</p>
<p>The god of summer has already spread its cruel wings and descended upon the world, expanding the authority of heat everywhere. Are humans, who are called the spirit of all things, relatively intelligent? I am reporting my daily necessities roughly:</p>
<p>Regarding Clothing</p>
<p>For long shirts and short shirts and pants, I chose China yarn produced by Sanyou Industrial Company, because of its fine and clean texture, soft and smooth against the skin, non-sticky when sweating, and very cheap price. When the weather is relatively cool, the long shirts I wear are also made of "Vienna" produced by Sanyou Company, because Vienna is elastic, does not wrinkle easily, and the color never fades. The undershirt is a Goose brand undershirt produced by Wuhe Weaving Factory, because it is durable and absorbs sweat most easily.</p>
<p>For Hats, I chose straw hats produced by Huafu Factory, Guanyi Factory, and Hefeng Factory, which are cheap, beautiful, and durable.</p>
<p>Regarding Bathing</p>
<p>For bath towels, I chose a No. 73 bath towel produced by Sanyou Company, which costs only 2 jiao and 9 fen per towel. After taking a cold water bath, I dry myself, which is very refreshing and comfortable, and can also be used as a small quilt at night.</p>
<p>The bath soap is medicated soap from Wuzhou Pharmacy, which functions to sterilize and disinfect, which is beneficial to hygiene.</p>
<p>After bathing, when enjoying the cool breeze and chatting, I was afraid of being affected by the wind and cold, so I went to Sanyou Company to buy a bathrobe to wear. Although the price is more than 2 yuan, after wearing it, it is not only convenient to put on and take off, but also very cool. It can be used as pajamas at night.</p>
<p>The back scrubber was also bought from Sanyou Company, because using a back scrubber when scrubbing your back makes it easier to remove dirt and save effort.</p>
<p>Regarding Bedding</p>
<p>Using a mosquito net is originally annoying, but mosquitoes are hateful, so I had to go to Sanyou Company to buy a sanitary mosquito net, which costs more than 6 yuan, but it is very cool and does not feel stuffy at all.</p>
<p>The sheets, thin quilts, and pillows are almost entirely handled by Sanyou Company. Others may say that you are doing free advertising for Sanyou Company, but no, Sanyou Company's goods are really very affordable and economical, and are national goods stores that are worthy of trust.</p>
<p>Regarding Other Items</p>
<p>Mosquito coils: I need to practice my homework at night, and the mosquitoes in the room are buzzing annoyingly, so the Samsung mosquito coils from China Chemical Industry Co. are almost like mosquito repellent envoys, and the mosquitoes will run away without being driven away.</p>
<p>Towels: Almost all Chinese people know the benefits of Triangle brand towels. I like to use them very much because they do not harden even after washing until they are broken.</p>
<p>Laundry soap: I use the Gubensao produced by Wuzhou Daye Pharmacy, because of its good quality and easy dirt removal, so we are very happy to use it.</p>
<p>Research on Summer Clothing</p>
<p>By Nian An</p>
<p>As the weather gets hotter day by day, trendy women are changing into thin red and green gauze, flaunting themselves on the market, which certainly attracts a lot of attention; especially when the jade legs are blown up by the wind. However, the wealthy and leisurely in society are ultimately in the minority. The majority of the people, even in the scorching heat of the sun, still have to struggle for a living; however, no matter how hot the weather is, clothing is indispensable, and the cost of daily changes is not less than that of spring clothes; this raises a major issue regarding the selection of materials. In my opinion, there should be the following two understandings:</p>
<p>In terms of material, it must be fine, clean, and strong, avoiding being too thin and suitable for practical use, with cotton fabrics being the best; because they are more absorbent</p>

<p>Literary Sentiments of the Times, Yin Chengyu</p>
<p>Gazing east from Yuguan, the grass stretches boundlessly,</p>
<p>The barbarian cavalry like clouds, ten thousand miles long.</p>
<p>Who remembers the mountains and rivers turned into broken walls,</p>
<p>Leaving behind only the chaos of armies and horses?</p>
<p>Xin Ting's remaining regrets are held by Zhou Kai,</p>
<p>Southern crossing widely sought to restore Luoyang.</p>
<p>Ashamed that this scholar cannot repay the country,</p>
<p>I wish to use my aspirations to serve the training ground.</p>
<p>Expressing Sentiments</p>
<p>Seeking leisure, yet leisure is unattainable,</p>
<p>Pursuing learning, yet learning remains incomplete.</p>
<p>Drifting through life,</p>
<p>Only now do I understand my parents' feelings.</p>
<p>The stench fills my homeland,</p>
<p>Where can I learn to live forever?</p>
<p>The solitary lamp flickers in the evening,</p>
<p>The sound of twilight rain at the forest window.</p>
<p>From School to Society</p>
<p>I can confidently say that young people living in schools are the least able to understand the actual society thoroughly. This is because the essence of education is to transform society, not to adapt to it. The hearts of young people are pure, not base. However, actual society is invariably in contradiction and conflict with these ideals. This is perhaps acknowledged by some young people who have stepped into society.</p>
<p>Let me put aside my personal setbacks over the past two years and cite a few examples to discuss the lessons and understandings that society has given me.</p>
<p>With the intention of exchanging labor for a living, I accepted the position of a so-called private secretary. I thought it wouldn't be too bad or too contrary to the meaning of life. But the reality was different. My so-called employer was not genuinely dedicated to society and in need of a secretary's assistance. Instead, he was very wealthy and wanted to exploit the labor of others to elevate his own status. Because he felt his own efforts to ingratiate himself with society were insufficient. Thus, my heart was broken by him. I wrote articles for him with the goal of spreading his name in magazines and newspapers. The theory had to be moderate, and it was best to cite many wise words from contemporary celebrities, so that people in society would see that not only was his talent praiseworthy, but his writing was also excellent. I wrote letters for him, which he prepared to use as a stepping stone to request studying abroad. He often said: "With writings, and with more relationships in various aspects, there will be a way. You work hard, and there will be substantial rewards in the future!" This meant that studying and writing articles were for building "connections" and elevating one's personal social status. When I was in school, I never dreamed of this. I only knew that the purpose of studying and the intention of writing were to solve my own livelihood from the intention of contributing to society and seeking the welfare of the public. That was enough.</p>
<p>Once, I went to X City to find a friend to seek employment. Upon meeting, my friend said: "You want to find a job? How is your mouth? If you can't boast a few skills, relying solely on so-called ability or a friend's recommendation won't work!" Utterly naive, I didn't pay much attention at the time, thinking he was just joking. Knowing he was a resourceful friend, I still stayed without much concern. He introduced me once, twice, three times. I stayed for ten days, half a month, a month. The result was constant setbacks, without any progress. At the same time, I saw others succeed within a few days after a single introduction. So my friend said: "That person knows how to talk, knows how to praise, and has a certain relationship, a certain 'historical background.'" Only then did I realize something. I rolled up my bedding and said goodbye to my friend: "I'll go back for now!" "Okay, go work on your writing. We'll talk again when there's an opportunity!" Heaven knows, is this something I ever dreamed of in school? Even with a brain full of talent and a bachelor's degree, where can I auction it off?</p>
<p>Another time, I returned to my hometown of X X, and a few friends gathered to discuss starting a weekly newspaper. Some advocated pulling strings and finding a backstage boss, while others strongly argued for creating a name first before accepting any self-sought backing or subsidies. The ultimate purpose of starting the newspaper was to lay a foundation in X X. This was another base and filthy farce, never imagined when running a wall newspaper or society journal in school. But my friends said with experience that if it wasn't done this way, there was no point in doing it at all. If you want to promote culture, the social environment will not allow it. So, like a fleeting flower, it vanished in a few days.</p>
<p>From these few extremely ordinary facts, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p>
<p>(1) Education does not transform society. The resounding words in the teacher's mouth and the truths in the textbook can only assist you in going in the opposite direction, and cannot be truly applied to actual society.</p>
<p>(2) If you want to survive in society, you must "adapt." If someone says "yes," you must follow up with a "right." If someone is higher than you, you must flatter them. If someone is lower than you, you might as well lord over them and treat them like a lapdog. You must master the art of "blowing" and "flattering." When you do things, only consider whether it benefits yourself, whether it can solidify your own position, and expand your own influence. You must wring out the purity of your heart and set aside the truths and beliefs in the textbooks.</p>
<p>This terrible real society!</p>
<p>Clerk's Communication: I Want to Change Customs</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a young man in my twenties, and I have never been involved in any major events. Today, I am requesting your help in resolving a difficult issue, namely marriage. Four years ago, through the words of a matchmaker, I became engaged to a traditional woman. Recently, I received a letter from my hometown stating that the wedding date has been chosen. According to the customs of my hometown, the wedding procedures are very troublesome and costly, which I personally strongly disagree with. I intend to use the newest and simplest form of marriage, eliminating all the procedures. I am afraid that my uncles and the woman's family will oppose this. How should I deal with them? Please help me think of the most appropriate and simplest solution!</p>
<p>Respectfully, Wang Jiwei</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The traditional wedding procedures are indeed troublesome and costly. Wang's proposal for reform is not without merit. However, in life, unless it concerns one's own vital interests, one should not necessarily stubbornly cling to one's own views. Other matters of minor importance should perhaps not be held onto so rigidly. For example, at the time of the wedding, if it is within one's means, spending a little more money is not a big deal. We who study economic issues should focus on the entire society. If I spend a little more money today, this money will still circulate in society! Moreover, once a new family is formed (the bride), they will inevitably need to buy some new furniture, so it is not necessarily a waste. Even if some old-fashioned customs are used, the cost is not very high, and it has no relation to the marriage itself. If one stubbornly insists on one's own views, causing rifts in various relationships, it is probably not worth it. Therefore, this matter should be handled with consideration within the limits of one's financial ability and without harming relationships. Excessive spending is certainly not right, but being too stubborn is also unnecessary.</p>

<p>Novel: Under the Traffic Lights (13) Xilin</p>
<p>":: : How do you like this wine? Drink up, it's still cold, drink some to warm up!" How could Shi Qiao refuse? When his ears started to feel hot from drinking, the four legs under the table were already entangled with each other. The two pairs of eyes were also crossing on the table. Shi Qiao thought to himself: I might as well get drunk. Using alcohol to vent frustration is common, and it's true that alcohol can cloud one's judgment. His blood rushed upward, and he seemed to suddenly realize that a beautiful young woman was beside him, and that her leg was getting hot on his own leg!</p>
<p>"I'm full, I can't eat anymore!" he said.</p>
<p>"Me too, you guys can take it and eat it yourselves!" The third concubine dismissed Ah Zhen, then went to close the door, turned her head, pouted, and pointed at Shi Qiao.</p>
<p>"You bad thing!"</p>
<p>The coquettishness of drunkenness is even more captivating. Her cheeks were red like peach blossoms. She walked over and fell into Shi Qiao's arms. Her hot body intensely ignited Shi Qiao's desire, and their breathing gradually became more rapid.</p>
<p>It was the third concubine's hand that turned off the electric light:::</p>
<p>"::: Uh, brother, can I call you Brother Qiao from now on?:::" This voice sounded like it was exhaling intermittently from a tightly pressed chest.</p>
<p>Downstairs, Ah Zhen and Chang Fa were almost finished eating. Fortunately, this was, at most, just a matter of one meal.</p>
<p>(9) "How is it?" "Still the same!"</p>
<p>Shi Qiao woke up early and felt his stomach rumbling with hunger. Thinking about what happened last night, he couldn't help but purse his lips and smile to himself. But the smile of an unemployed person is the easiest to disappear. He reached into his pocket and found only three meal tickets. Looking at his watch, it was only seven o'clock. He wanted to visit Chen Tianren as early as possible. Chen Tianren was a second-rate important person. His backstage boss had been dismissed not long ago. Currently, they were strongly advocating resistance against Japan. Shi Qiao had visited him twice, and the conversations were quite harmonious. He recognized Shi Qiao as a very capable grassroots activist. Shi Qiao wanted to start an anti-Japanese publication, so of course he thought that finding them was a relatively quick path.</p>
<p>The morning pedestrians were very sparse. The sound of newspaper sellers echoed sadly back and forth on the street. Along the way, Shi Qiao pondered how to explain his plan to Chen Tianren, how to gain his favor and trust. The speech he had prepared was indeed very brilliant and moving, and he was sure that things would definitely succeed. He felt happy in his heart. He raised his head, took a breath of fresh air, and then walked victoriously towards Chen's mansion.</p>
<p>Reaching the gate of the mansion, he re-examined the grand speech he had prepared. After pressing the doorbell, the servant opened the door a crack, as if afraid that an uninvited guest would suddenly rush in. He first sized up Shi Qiao's attire, and then said:</p>
<p>"Your card, I'll go see if Commissioner Chen is home?" The servants always liked to call out the master's official title. Even a commander-in-chief who had been dismissed for several years was still called "Commander So-and-So" by everyone. After he went in, Shi Qiao's heart started to beat faster. He couldn't tell whether it was cowardice or excessive excitement.</p>

<p>▲ Union Representatives Petition Party and Government Agencies</p>
<p>▲ Demand that the Factory Fulfill the Labor-Management Contract</p>
<p>The Pudong British-American Workers' Children's School was established in 1928. On April 1, 1929, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs, together with labor and management, signed a labor-management contract stipulating that the factory would be happy to subsidize the school's expenses. At that time, the factory provided a monthly subsidy of 1,500 yuan. At that time, there were only over 300 students. Now it has grown to over 600 students, but the factory subsidy has been reduced to 750 yuan, which has limited the school's administration and made it impossible to develop economically. The school plans to hire educators as trustees starting next semester to seek improvements. However, the factory suddenly used poor management as an excuse and insisted on taking it back. The union was surprised to hear this and has sent representative Chen Peide to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs, demanding that the factory fulfill the contract. The result was very satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Sports Association Plans to Launch Chinese Baseball League <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>▲ But Schools on Vacation May Make It Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>The National Sports Federation, in view of the fact that baseball in Shanghai is about to disappear, has no choice but to promote and revitalize it. It has contacted universities such as St. John's, Fudan, and Jiaotong to launch the Shanghai Chinese Baseball League Championship this summer. It has dismantled the west side of the baseball field's grandstand and the wire mesh to create a ground for baseball games. However, as it is the summer vacation and schools are on break, most of the students are scattered, and it may be difficult to organize teams. Therefore, the Sports Federation's plan may be difficult to realize. If a dedicated team is formed, there will be no opponents to compete against. Western teams are too strong, making it impossible to win. And a league competition may be difficult to achieve. Promoting baseball is also difficult. It is hoped that all schools will organize teams to participate and work together to revitalize baseball.</p>

<p>In recent years, many players from the Hong Kong South China and Chinese football clubs have been serving in Guangzhou. When South China and China have important games, they go to Hong Kong to participate in the war.

Therefore, it was specially discussed at the meeting on the 14th of this month, and it was resolved that players who do not reside within the jurisdiction of Hong Kong and Kowloon may not participate in the competition. This is very unfavorable to the South China and China clubs.</p>

<p>▲ Result: 11 to 4, Second, Third, and Fourth Groups Win Completely</p>
<p>▲ First Group Loses One Point in a Dramatic Battle, Fifth Group Loses Completely</p>
<p>In yesterday's lawn tennis league match between the Chinese Club and the powerful Japanese Internal and External Spinning Factory, the location was inside the Japanese Spinning Factory at the intersection of Robert Road and Jiaozhou Road. The Chinese Club and the Japanese Spinning Factory each defeated the Japanese Club with a score of 10 to 5. Therefore, yesterday's battle was thought to be very intense. But as a result, the Chinese Club won by a score of 11 to 4. Thus, the Chinese Club's hope for the championship is becoming more and more stable. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ Lin Maihua Zheng Zhaojia {7丨9 7丨5 6丨1} Machida Koji (Japan)</p>
<p>㈡ Qiu Feihai Xian Yaobin {6丨0 6丨3 6丨2} Tsukiji Kamata (Japan)</p>
<p>㈢ Yu Tianguang Liang Deguang {6丨2 7丨5 7丨5} Sakane Imai (Japan)</p>

<p>㈤ Zheng Zirong Zhou Huafu {6丨8 3丨6 8丨10} Yamamoto Kobayashi (Japan)</p>
<h3 id="e201">Dramatic Battle in the First Group <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first group, Lin and Zheng, because they were too careful, made their arms weak and nervous, and the ball situation got worse and worse, resulting in a 7 to 9 loss in the first set. Japanese players Machida and Koji attacked behind Lin and Zheng with high balls, giving them no chance to counterattack. Lin and Zheng were in a very difficult situation and could only return with high balls, but with little accuracy, either going out of bounds or near the net, where they were subject to the opponent's fierce attacks. In the first set, Lin and Zheng were trapped in this situation and were at a loss. In addition, the two were less energetic yesterday than they had been in the previous battle against the Japanese Club, and they were like two different people. Lin and Zheng lost 1 to 4 first, then chased to 5 to 5, but the following priorities were all taken by the opponent, resulting in a final loss of 7 to 9. In the second set, Lin and Zheng won 5 to 3, thinking it would be easy to win, but unexpectedly it became 5 to 5 again, and they won 7 to 5, which was worrying. In the third set, Lin and Zheng's momentum was stronger and slightly better, ending with 6 to 1.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Complete Defeat in the Fifth Group <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The complete defeat in the fifth set cost China three points. If they could have taken one or two, the total score would have been even more impressive. Zheng Zirong and Zhou Huafu, who played, lacked stability, and because of their age, they had no heroic spirit. As a result, they lost 6 to 8, 3 to 6, and 8 to 10 completely.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Complete Victory in the Remaining Three Groups <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The second group, Qiu Feihai and Qian Yaobin, finished the earliest. Their opponents, Tsukiji and Kamata, had average skills and could not withstand Qiu and Qian's fierce attacks. As a result of the three sets, Qiu and Qian lost only five of the total twenty-three games, which can be said to be extremely easy. The next to finish was the third group, Yu Tianguang and Liang Deguang. In the first set, Yu and Liang won 6 to 2 very easily. The situation in the following two sets was tense, but Yu and Liang won 7 to 5 in a row. The next to finish was the fifth group, Tu Kaiyuan and Sun Linfang, who also won in three straight sets. The three groups won a total of nine points, and China won in a triumphant manner with a score of 11 to 4.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Great Hope for China <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>In the Group A lawn tennis league, China has played five times, winning 58 of 75 sets and losing only 17 sets, which is unmatched. All strong opponents such as Portugal, the Japanese Club, the Japanese Spinning Factory, South Lawn, and North Lawn have been defeated. The remaining three teams, the French Chamber of Commerce, the Xieqiao General Association, and the Citibank Country Association, are all of average strength. Therefore, China is almost certain to win the championship.</p>
