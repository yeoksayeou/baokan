<p>時評</p>
<h3>海軍界之責任自覺都</h3>
<p>自謝剛哲就任海軍第三艦隊司令後。即將司令部及敎導隊遷往威海衛。其他附屬部隊。雖仍留駐靑島。亦令移紥市外。據謝氏語人。此舉動機。第一。在避免干政之嫌疑。第二。在擺脫奢華之風氣。允哉斯言。何其娓娓之動聽也軍人䟦扈。由來已久。怠敖成性。積重難返。國勢所以陵夷至此者。要宜由此輩負其强半之責任。吾人縱極痛心疾首。顧亦未嘗作明白之提示。何幸得謝氏一發此旨。更何幸於軍事長官之口中。得聞此責任自覺之言</p>
<p>原夫軍人捍衛邦家爲天職。本不應作干預政治之活動。軍人以鍜鍊身手爲亟務。又豈容有頽靡習慣之沾染。然在今日我國軍人。固多視軍籍爲特殊階級。而憑藉之以爲致身之捷徑者。是其心中先無捍衛邦家之念。寧有奮發圖强之意。上自長官。下至士兵。殆無不懐挾一優閒之目標。而曲折以求其達。唯其以享樂爲目的。故多方希圖干政以助長其發展。亦唯其已取得干政之機會。故益增進其奢侈之欲望。如此互爲因果。互爲推盪。欲求軍紀之不敗壞豈可得乎。</p>
<p>軍人干政之影響。每使政界爲之不寧。而平添許多無謂之紛擾。軍人享樂之結果。必減消戰鬭之壯志。而失郤技術之修養。此在我國海軍界中。尤爲恒見之現象。海軍之徒具形式。鮮所建樹。而於政局俶擾之頃。常多煽亂助禍之舉。吾人前此亦既已貢其罪言矣。近如楚有艦之試砲。竟發生砲彈反射之事。夫以新經修理之後。充分準備之餘。公開試騐之時。鄭重監視之下。而猶有此意外之變故。則其平日戰鬭之演習如何。技術之修養如何。不可想見耶。監委高友唐氏謂海軍本無名譽可言。雖在吾人。亦覺其言之過重。海軍界將士寧能汗顏忍受。載與終古乎。抑亦將發憤淬勵。一圖湔雪乎。</p>
<p>以言湔雪。不在於反唇相稽。而在乎内省不疚。湔雪之道。不能藉空言爲掩</p>
<p>飾之工具。要當以事實爲最後之證明。如海長陳紹寛謂砲彈反射爲無足奇者。斯種有類文過之言。非吾儕所樂聞。必如謝剛哲能有自覺之表示。方爲吾人所期許。謝氏既已昌言於先。當能自靖於後。吾願謝氏。自今以往。砥䃺心力。沈著赴機。以澈底明其眞實之責任自覺。尤願海軍界全體將士。在此激厲鞭策之下。明乎素餐之未便久尸。苟安之不能再偷。椎胸擢髮。一致奮起。以共謀整個海軍之責任自覺。庶幾求全之毀得免。不虞之譽可致。發揚海軍之新氣象。吾於此致其無限之企禱矣。</p>
<h3>古巴革命成功臨時政府成立</h3>
<p>波爾特拉主席兼攝外交新政府否認有共產傾向美艦開古巴護僑</p>
<p>哈伐那　古巴塞斯貝特政府又被推倒、革命軍人已聯合急進反對派、組織革命委員會、推聖馬丁大學格勞敎授爲領袖、暫執政權、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>哈伐那　古巴革命委員會、已將新政府各部在執行委員五人中、分配就緒、主席波爾特拉氏兼綰司法及外交、加爾波氏任内長兼綰交通陸軍及海軍、法朗加氏任財長、桑瑪旦氏任敎育兼衛生、伊里薩利氏任公共工程、兼農業及商務、各該部次長仍留原職、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>哈伐那　新任古巴總統塞斯貝特博士出京調查風災之際、有陸軍軍曹巴狄斯太結合大學敎授一人及急進派新聞家一人、逐塞而組織彼等所謂「眞正革命政府、」巴狄斯太自稱陸海軍均贊助之、且稱、其目的乃在淸除擁護前總統馬嘉度之軍官、而依民治最新之概念、復興古巴、今日市上槍聲頻頻不已、但皆向空射擊、未聞有所死傷、巴狄斯太立即宣布渠準備將政權交與依法選舉之國會、至於古巴之條約義務、均將加以尊重云、有秩序之示威運動刻正在街市中進行、另有軍隊巡邏街市、以防發生意外事端、塞斯貝特總統聞警馳回京城、但内務部長已宣布渠與前閣員準備與新政府合作、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>革命初起</h3>
<p>按昨日事變初起時、不過軍隊譁變、驅逐拘禁阿附馬嘉度前總統之軍官、公推剛柴萊上士爲參謀長、剛氏又讀賢於巴狄斯太上士、是是此兩上士遂爲全軍之指揮、而成臨時狄克推多、並</p>
<p>得警察加入革命、</p>
<h3>組成政府</h3>
<p>嗣自稱自由主義派之急進反對黨、及開始運動化軍隊叛變爲政治革命剛巴兩人自知無政治經騐、遂從其議、組織一革命委員會、委員五人、推格勞敎授爲領袖、並推德拉篤爾中尉爲可令兼發言人、</p>
<h3>逼走總統</h3>
<p>革命委員會既告成立、首即要求總統塞斯見特改革政治、總統允之、嗣乃要求内閣辭職、迨内閣總辭職、猶不滿意、數小時後、復請總統讓位、塞斯貝特立離總統府、但聲稱因無相當機關可以接受其辭職、故迄今未曾辭職、於是革命委員會乃遷入總統府辦公、</p>
<h3>五人執委會之組織</h3>
<p>哈伐那　古巴革命委員會、頃指派執行委員五人、㈠桑瑪旦博士、㈡波爾特拉博士、㈢伊利薩里博士、㈣加爾波、㈤法朗加、倡導某命之陸軍上士巴狄斯太原爲智利人、後歸化古巴、現被推爲爲陸軍總司令、若干方面、對於執行委員會之組織、表示憂慮、其中若干人倾向過激主義、尤以加爾波氏爲然、加氏係一著作家、曾在蘇聯旅居兩年之久、上述執行委員五人、權力平等、僅於名義上由波爾特拉氏、執行主席職務云云、現國家警察署長、已被罷免、由上士勞朗代之、又海軍總參謀長一職、亦已由另一上士擔任、（五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>發表公報</h3>
<p>委員會逼走總統後、乃發公報數起、宣布計畫政策、其一聲明尊重國家債務、尤其外債、其二否認有大改政府制度意、謂將組織臨時政府、召集憲法會議、修改憲法、其三發表阿附馬嘉度之軍官數人、經軍法審問後、業已革職、但不認哈伐那有槍斃軍官情事、據委員會發言人德拉篤爾中尉聲稱、　斯貝特政府不能代表人民、故應加以大改革、又據公報發表、委員會不欲久握政柄、一俟憲法貨幣經濟及軍事改革、俱獲有保障後、即將辭職、德拉篤爾並聲稱、對於美軍艦之來此、絕無憤慨意、</p>
<h3>政黨擁護</h3>
<p>哈伐那　前在推翻馬嘉度政府時居領袖地位之ＡＢＣ政黨、今日經長時間會議後宣稱、對新政府守中立地位、此項宣言料將有益於新政府、大足以增加其樹立鞏固其礎之機會、（五日國民社電）</p>
<h3>否認左傾</h3>
<p>查格勞敎授爲聖馬丁大學敎授、係一著名革命人物、但其態度、與其視爲急進、不若稱爲自由派之較覺切合、迄今革命領袖中、尙無共黨色彩、格勞亦聲稱、不容此種激烈人物參加新革命、唯有數方面頗惴惴於事態之惡化、或</p>
<p>致有赤色之加入、</p>
<h3>巴狄斯太略歷</h3>
<p>哈伐那　古巴海陸軍叛變首領巴狄斯太上士之經歷、大致如下、巴氏未入軍隊以前、爲速記生、在司法界服務、成績最好、最近八年以來、軍事法庭筆錄由渠擔任、乘此機會與多數大學生及馬嘉度之敵黨人物相結識、外間風傳此次叛變、由於政府擬裁减軍餉、但巴狄斯太否認此說、外間又謂、巴氏個人與馬嘉度一派有關係、亦爲渠所否認、前陸長赫賴拉宣言、並不知有此人、巴狄斯太謂此次奪取指揮權之兵士及下級軍官、一俟政府組織就緒之後、準備各回原來階級、對於未嘗害民之軍官仍服從之、巴氏又謂、海陸軍中絕無共產黨運動、萬一有之、渠亦决不容忍云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>司空見慣</h3>
<p>目下京城之内安堵如常、人民之視革命、無異選舉然、外省軍隊亦尙無反對此間革命領袖之表示、惟事勢仍在未定之天、因目下顯似缺乏中心權力可以保障秩序、革命委員會僅得若干軍曹自稱足以代表海陸軍者之擁護、塞斯貝特總統尙未正式辭職、其閣員實際亦紙袖手不問而已、</p>
<h3>槍斃軍官</h3>
<p>曾在馬嘉度時代握軍權之軍事長官、已有數人在營内槍斃之訊、且聞當局已擬有應行槍斃者之名單、所列人數頗衆、桑地亞戈地方亦有四軍官爲兵士所槍斃、</p>
<h3>排美行動</h3>
<p>又聞激烈份子已請委員會剷除美人勢力、據美國退伍軍人會某君聲稱、此訊頗確、美僑生命正在危險之中、渠曾偕另一退伍軍人今夜走遍哈伐那全市通知美僑及其他外僑、苟見有排外暴動之象、立即避往國民旅館、退伍軍人將恊同美海軍陸戰隊擔任保衛之責、</p>
<h3>美派軍艦</h3>
<p>美驅逐艦麥克法蘭號、已自凱韋斯特開抵此間、另有四艘亦已在途、美大使韋爾士雖已間接警告各派、萬一發生内戰定將召致干涉但仍代表美國務卿赫爾聲明此次派遣軍艦、並無干涉意、祇爲保護美僑生命起見、現各派領袖覩此形勢、已紛赴美大使署擔保不致有流血情事、</p>
<h3>干涉恫嚇</h3>
<p>美大使韋爾士刻正忙於與革命領袖會商一切、並將經過情形報告華盛頓、雖未公然作干涉之威嚇、但曾間接警告革命委員與德拉篤爾中尉、苟發生公然叛亂情事、美海軍陸戰隊立將登岸、惟大使署曾聲明、無論干涉與否、决不致危及古巴之獨立云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務卿赫爾與國務院專任拉丁美洲事務（將繼威爾斯而爲駐古巴大使）之略佛利氏、晋謁羅斯福總統、會商古巴時局歷時甚久、對美國或將干涉一層、亦曾討論及之、會商後發表公報、謂除業已派往古巴之軍艦數艘以外、將另派多艘、在古巴領海左近停泊云、觀目前種種情狀、古巴境内若有内戰暴發、則美國定將迅速行動、但國務院高級官吏則謂關於此層、尙無任何决定、且渠等不贊成美國有何行動、羅斯福總統則以美國未嘗干涉而能使馬嘉度辭職、聲威可謂甚盛、此種既得之威望、不欲喪失、但又有人推測美國恐將有不能不干涉之勢、此外古巴代理總統塞斯貝特不過避居私邸、</p>
<p>實則並未正式辭職、新任駐古巴大使喀佛利氏宣言云、「吾美根據皮拉特補充條欵、確有干涉之權力、第實際行使此權、極爲美國所厭惡」、又謂、美國政府所最注重者、乃在國際問題之中、維持鄰國友好關係云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本危機濳伏</h3>
<p>對内對外應付困難產業復興終成妄想</p>
<p>丨俄報之評論丨</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯政府公報「伊斯維斯太」載一社評、分析日本之國内情境、該報在評論最近日本内閣之改組運動時、指明齋藤首相政治策劃之實質、乃含有使政友會潛行之倒閣陰謀趨於麻痺之努力、該報在詳論日本經濟狀况後、即得結論曰、其經濟恐慌繼續深化與尖銳同時所謂產業復興僅成一種妄想、現時之財政情况、搆成日本資本家最嚴重之問題、而最難問題、即在如何覓得資金以繼續其瘋狂樣的軍備擴張、此等問題外、復益以整個國際局面之日趨複雜與緊張、於是日帝國主義遂遭　最大之難關、同時國内政治情勢、復日趨緊張、羣衆之不滿情緒日形高漲、雖以警察之恐慌、亦未能遏止「危險思想」之增長、「伊斯維斯太」報於是作結論曰、此種局面遂促進屬於同一階級之諸敵對政當起而一致合作之企圖云、（五日塔斯社電）</p>
<h3>日首相招待貴院代表</h3>

<p>（東京）日首相齋藤實、今日下午四時招待上院各派代表、到會者四十多人、近衛議長因病不到、齋藤說明與下院三黨總裁會見經過、並要求上院各派予以精神的援助、一條公爵質問首相謂、五一五案公判後、國民對政黨埋怨更深、政府是否與政黨妥協、齋藤答云、政府僅求下院各派之精神的援助、並未協定國策、故未有妥恊與不妥恊、因内外時局嚴重、要求上下兩院之精神能一致維持政府、衝破此危急而已、（六日華聯電）</p>
<h3>荷蘭參加英日通商會議</h3>
<p>日本表示反對荷日間仲裁條約日政府諮詢樞府</p>
<p>（東京）六日外傳英國以英荷棉業恊定之存在爲理由、擬要求日本承認荷蘭參加日英通商會議之說、然日外務省對於此說、以如下理由表示反對意見、英國雖與日本之間成立恊定、然日貨經過荷蘭輸入英國、則不能達成恊定目的、故主張荷蘭之參加會議、但日本當局對於日英及日印會議之方針、以不恊議第三國市塲問題爲原則、英方如提議此問題、日本官民定予拒絕、（六日日聯社電）</p>

<h3>㈩郊迎十里</h3>
<p>蘭州機塲距城可十二里、各界之盼羅部長蒞臨、往返迎接者已三日矣、十二時半、飛機安然降落、蘭州時間爲十一時半、較西安時間適遲一小時、在機塲歡迎者有甘省府主席朱紹良、綏靖主任鄧寳珊、來甘甫二日之靑海省府主席馬麟、甘省敎廳長水梓、建廳長劉汝璠財廳長譚克敏、民廳長魏敷滋、秘書長李拯中、臨夏區警備司令馬爲良、高法院長曾友豪、首檢詹世銘、省黨委凌子性、張文蔚、新疆省黨委曹啟文、回神馬國禮·馬國棟·及各機關代表、各學校各民衆團體、及軍警約二三千人、羅部長於軍樂歡奏聲中下機、頭暈目眩、與歡迎人員一一握手爲禮、經歡迎牌樓、與朱馬二主席同車進城、全城均懇旗、邊省人民擁護中央之熱忱、於此可見也、</p>

<h3>㈩㈡甘省司法</h3>
<p>甘省司法情形、可約述如次、㈠經費困難、自民</p>
<p>十四西北軍抵甘後、因軍費活繁、司法人員每月僅給維持費二十元、浸假而祗發十之三四、職員枵腹從公、困苦異常、去歲省府正式成立、經費稍有增加、然仍時形竭蹶高法院長每月僅支維持費八十元、推檢七十元、書記官五十元、錄事纔十餘元耳、卽此區區之數仍未能按月如數支領也㈡法院組織、高等法院設於省垣、凉州天水肅州平凉四縣各設分院、皐蘭設地方法院、臨洮臨夏臨潭岷縣等三十四縣設司法公署、均以縣長兼檢察官職務、各置審判官一員、其餘各縣司法、則悉由縣長兼理、至於監獄、則已成立者爲省垣第一監獄、凉州第二監獄餘如天水平凉肅州亦各先後建築新監、或因開辦無費、已落成而被駐軍損壞、或因建築費不足、中道而廢無力續修、以致全功盡棄、殊爲可惜、㈢訴訟案件並不繁多、法院無積壓之弊、高等法院每月約計受理民事第二審案件二三起、第三審案件三四起、抗告二三起、雜件八九起、刑事第二審約三四起、刑事第三審二三起、覆判案件二三起、盜匪案件一二起、以訴訟之性質而論、則刑事案件大抵爲命盜案、此蓋由於民性强悍所致、民事案件關於債務者至多亦不過一二千元、此可見西北人民之疾苦、南方各省所常見之欺詐和誘離婚案件、幾絕無僅有、翻閱卷宗、祗見一女子因其夫久出不歸、迫於生計、請求法院准予另嫁、此與南方之離婚案件、其性質已迥然不同、</p>
<h3>㈩㈢熱烈歡迎</h3>
<p>甘省各界、以羅部長及靑海省府主席馬麟、先後蒞甘、爲表示熱烈歡迎計、特定三十日上午九時、舉行歡迎大會、羅部長辭不獲已、祇得多留一日、三十日天氣晴朗、晨七時、旅甘廣東同鄉、特舉行茶會、歡迎羅部長、旅甘粤人約二十餘、大多業鐘表照相回憶留西安時、得悉西安之鐘表照相業、亦均爲粤人、此殆粤人之專業歟、九時出席歡迎大會、會塲卽在省府大門外之廣場、廣場上築有樓臺、蓋天然之主席台也、參加歡迎會者、黨政軍警各民衆團體各學校多可萬餘人、其熱烈誠摯之情緒、有非南方一般歡迎會之浮於表面者所可比擬、於此可見邊疆人民、擁護中央之熱烈、與夫期望中央挽救人民痛苦之殷切矣、如儀開會後、首由主席朱紹良氏致開會詞、</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>繼以羅部長·馬主席·旅甘監委黎丹·綏靖主任鄧實珊·等演說、均一致表示熱誠擁護中央、並感激中央關心邊疆之盛情、尤切盼中央着手開發西北、十時半散會、羅部長卽赴高等法院、出席全城司法界之歡迎會、並致訓詞、正午法界歡迎一時許返寓休息、三時各界歡迎大會籌備會、假敎育館開音樂會、得一聆秦腔、雖茫然莫明所以、然慷慨悲歌、音調激昻、一聞而知其與南方靡靡之音迥不相同也、六時各界歡宴、與席者百餘人、八時返省府、接蔣委員長來電、靑海第九師長馬步芳、凉州騎兵第二師長馬步靑均有電來、馬步靑氏並堅請羅部長過凉時小住、預定明（三十一）晨飛凉第不知明晨氣候如何、蓋今晨五時、由西安飛出之航機、迄撰稿時尙不知下落、或已遇事、此段航程、苟氣候不佳、實危險萬分也</p>
<h3>㈩㈣蘭州印象</h3>
<p>留蘭兩日、忙於酬酢、刻無暇晷、雖各方之盛情可感、然余究以未能一觀蘭州社會狀况、大爲失望、蘭城四周皆山、一面臨河、形勢極險要、街道狹窄不平、表面上似不若西安、然一究實際、則又過之、據云此間氣候極佳、夏季最熱不過八十二三度、冬季亦不若南京之寒冷、惟略嫌乾燥、土地極肥美、瓜果蔬菜、凡江浙所產者、莫不產、而碩大肥美則遠勝之、惟水利不修、農寧全恃天時、苟雨水調和則一年所產足敷三年之用、但天時失宜、則又束手無策、甘省物產頗豐、藥材占全國最重要之地位、羊毛亦居大宗、玉門一帶之煤油俯拾皆是、其餘多不勝述、惜以交通梗阻運輸不便、本省所需外省物品、亦以交通不便、價値奇貴、茲姑述例、美麗牌香烟京滬每元可購二聽者、此問則每聽二元、其餘貨品、價値均在四五倍以上、甘省之交通陸路恃驢車、水路恃牛皮划子、牛皮划子者、以整牛皮六七隻或十餘隻、中塞羊毛、連結成划子、可浮於水面、順流而下、頗爲迅疾、凡由甘運綏之貨物、全以此爲利器、然不能逆水而行、故抵綏後、卽拆下負之返甘、如是往返不絕、是以西北人士所望於中央之開發西北者絕不須冠冕堂皇之計劃、其惟一之希望、卽爲開發交通、第一希望完成隴海路其次完成各公路、如道路暢達、則運輸便利、再能進而興修水利、則西北人民决無凍餒之虞、繁榮可期、不開發亦自開發矣、（八月三十日發自蘭州）</p>

<h3>劉文輝部由向育仁代領</h3>
<p>劉部尙有三萬人尙無决心入西康</p>
<p>重慶通信、自劉文輝離開雅安後、劉部由向育仁代領、川南軍事、業已告一段落、顧尙待結束者、乃雅河西岸劉軍殘部改編問題、故劉湘鄧錫侯各部、仍準備渡河、以促劉部等就範、聞劉部現下尙有三萬左右、劉文輝原欲將全部編制爲二十團、以十團駐西康、十團駐寗屬、嗣以劉鄧各部、繼續向該軍壓迫、而該部官兵、又多不允開駐康寗、即康寗方面、亦無力供給此龐大軍額、乃打銷原議、將駐天靈·雅安之部隊、交向育仁指揮、俾向氏出頭、請求劉湘收編、并懇劉鄧停止前進、劉文輝則率其最親信之劉文塘高育琮·朱銀洲·靑翰南等部、入駐康寗、西康原駐有鄧蟠村旅三團、寗遠原駐有劉竹林部三團、連同劉文輝在雅安率去之部隊、可得十六團、劉離開雅安後、進駐榮經、繼由榮經移駐漢源、聞將暫留漢源或赴西昌、以待向育仁向劉湘請示之結果、蓋劉以所率部既屬有限、與其就食他省、實不如托足川境、較有把握、劉竹村部、　在大渡河佈置軍事、沿岸一帶、安設警戒、劉文輝前派有兩團開往西昌、助劉守防、蓋恐劉鄧各部渡過雅河以後、必澈底消滅該軍、故不敢冒昧退入西康、因入康以後、必須自寗雅各屬運輸食米、以濟軍糧、萬一鑪定橋被封鎭、則入康部隊、坐以待斃、若寗屬各縣、食米產量甚豐、谷價之廉、素爲川中各縣所不及、如果退寗、即被劉鄧各部封鎖、給養上亦不致成爲問題、一面扼守大渡河、一面扼守大相嶺、亦足憑險死守、若將來劉鄧各部不再前進、即可保全康寗及榮經漢源各縣、此時入康、亦不爲遲、故今日之劉文輝、仍徘徊於岐途也、（九月三日）</p>
<h3>川北共匪蠢動</h3>
<p>匪犯間蒼各縣被擊退勦匪部隊决定一百團</p>
<p>重慶通訊川北赤匪、以兩劉軍事既結束、知川軍今後必以全力進勦、勢難倖存、乃爲先發制人計、突然猛犯閩蒼儀廣各縣、幸經田頌堯部竭力防堵、匪未得逞、且多被殺　、勢已稍挫、現劉湘已從事勦匪軍之編配限期肅淸各匪、茲悉川北匪害及勦匪軍編配　狀分述如次、</p>
<p>川北之徐匪向前、現有槍三萬餘支、人數近五六萬、　極標悍、在共匪中、除朱德外即以彼爲最强、但性殘忍、以殺人爲能事、老者殺、少者殺、有錢者殺、有智識者殺、所定殺人條律、多至四十八種其慘酷情形、殆可概見、前因與張國壽發生三角戀愛之衝突、（張堂妹琴秋、與徐張皆有私二人暗鬥已久、互不相下、）及權利之爭、形成兩大壁壘、内鬨頗烈、刻見川軍行將大舉進勦、乃大舉犯閬蒼儀廣縣、田頌堯軍劉漢雄李煒如各部、爲防堵該匪起見、陸續向前推進、日或一二十里、或五六十里不等、步步爲營、聞自閬中出發之勦赤軍、已到達普子岩、王銘章部已達百尺坡巴儀邊境各匪、聞風退往通南江城内、及附近各大山中、僞師長王洪民部及僞二十八團汪部暨三十一團、原駐九龍·長樂·龍鳳·竹谷關等處、刻已星夜退集南江、並聞徐向前張國壽等、擬將匪之主力、集中長池、希圖頑抗、其餘通南各關要、則驅新編之游擊隊相機攻守、但勦匪軍在土門塲、魏家樑·黃老廟·興隆塲·關公塲各地、均駐有重兵、防範周密、儀巴界連各地、共匪雖時出時没、均經官軍擊退、現劉漢雄師、已驅逐赤匪于距廣三十餘里外、該匪等見計不逞、乃大肆搶刦人民糧秣、城内人民、鑒其慘酷、均欲逃避、劉氏當即出示說明、並謂倘有不測、亦當與廣城共存亡、勸人民勿得驚惶、免遭流離之苦、民衆遂未他遷、</p>
<p>至劉湘對於勦匪計劃、已與田頌堯楊森劉存厚等商定、决在各軍中、抽調剿匪部隊、暫以團爲單位、全川共計抽調百團、加派飛機十架、恊同各軍進勦、務期一鼓肅淸、（國聞社九月一日）</p>
<h3>靑島漁業概况</h3>
<p>大好海利爲外人攫去　國漁户之所獲甚微</p>
<p>靑島通訊、靑市外濱黃海、内包膠澳、灣港天成、島嶼羅列、每當春秋二季、魚羣之洄游棲息於近海一帶者甚繁、實我國沿海之大好漁塲也、惜漁民大抵墨守舊法、不知改良、是以闢埠埀四十年、工商各業均日見發達、惟漁業未有進步、且自民三以後、日人佔領靑島、極力獎勵該國漁民捕魚、並設有水產組合、辦理貸欵販賣諸事、以致靑市漁業受其操縱、接收以還、屢次設法整頓、祇以政令迭更未能積極辦理、自渤海艦隊於民十六駐防靑島、分區巡弋保護、維持海權、於是漁業始有起色、復經本市社會局提倡、勸令市内富商組織靑島漁業公司、於前年正式成立、兩年以來、成績頗有可觀、茲將漁業概况、分别調查如次、</p>
<h3>漁户船數</h3>
<p>靑市沿海一帶及各島居民、因土地之貧瘠、及習慣關係居民除十之一二務農外、其餘均以捕魚爲業、民國四年、據日人調查陰島方面有漁舟三百三十艘、漁夫一千三百餘名、漁獲物價値約二萬五千元、沙子口方面有漁舟及筏三百艘、漁夫一千二百餘名、漁獲物價値十萬元、以外較小之漁村則無統計、又據十五年漁航局之調查報告、靑區漁船有一千四百餘艘、漁夫一萬一千人、又據民國六年時、日人在靑組織水產組合、中國方面、加入漁者有九千二百人、近據冀魯海洋漁業管理局及本市漁業公司之調查、靑島已有漁夫萬人上下、漁船一千四百餘艘、至捕魚區域灣内以陰島寫根據外海以沙子口姜哥莊爲中心、東越八千墩而達千里島南抵塔速島水靈山島、及　山灣内之石島等處</p>
<h3>漁民生活</h3>
<p>漁民生活、因其工作係一種冒險性、又缺乏敎育、故生活多屬放蕩、其辛苦之收入、多半消耗於嫖賭吃喝中、當未捕魚之先、所有一切費用、多貸諸漁業經紀人、俟獲魚歸來、售貨償貸、而漁業經紀人貸與漁民之欵、係由漁業公司借來、聞漁業公司此種無利貸欵之供給、每年放出在六七萬元以上、漁汛分春秋兩汛、春汛在陰歷三月中旬至五月中旬、此季以投網爲主、秋汛在陰歷六月下旬至九月上旬、此季以曳網爲主、至介類之獲取、沿海隨時皆可採取、靑區灣内女姑雙埠一帶尤富、雖時至冬令、亦有收獲、</p>
<h3>日人捕魚</h3>
<p>日人之來本市捕取魚類、始於民國三年、隨日軍以俱來、因該國官廳、給予諸種便宜、當民國五年爲最盛時代、幾奪我漁塲而佔領、民四五時、靑市有該國漁船一百三十餘艘、現在尙有船四十五艘、靑市沿海之加級魚、（此魚爲上等食品每斤約値洋五六角）產額極豐、在本市占重要銷塲、一年四季中均有此種鮮魚出售、多半係日人捕獲者、當春秋魚汛之際、日人乘大腹帆船、或輪船往海州方面捕取、小船則往來於水靈山島·大小公島·及塔連島·千里島一帶、雖冬季魚少　亦放小船赴塔連島之南獲取、一大型帆船每一年所獲値在七千元以上、小船亦有二千元以上之收入、我國漁船所獲、則不逮遠甚、又當民五時、日官廳爲獎勵捕取鱉魚、特選成續優良之帆船五艘、給予費用、令其前往塔連島嶗山灣之石島等處試取鰵魚、每船平均所獲在五百元上下、此後冬季卽常有日人在該數處捕取鰵魚矣日人所用捕魚工具爲繩釣·打網·升網流網·拖網·濳水器·等、所捕魚除加級魚爲最多數外、尙有鱶、魚比目魚·鯒魚·繁魚·鮑魚·海參·石花菜等、</p>
<h3>保護漁業</h3>
<p>齊魚沿海、本係我國產魚富區、而靑區沿海尤有多量之產額因我國漁民墨守舊法、不求新知致大好海利、爲外人攫占、民三日軍據靑、該國漁民隨之而來、侵越獲取、無從取締至民十六渤海艦隊來靑駐防　始有保護漁業之舉、維持海權、劃分黃渤海之間爲四區、卽滄洲島以南至海州附近爲第一區、滄洲島以北至成山頭一帶爲第二區、成山頭至黃縣招遠交界處爲第三區、黃招兩縣交界處至大沽河以北之附近海面爲第四區、分區派軍艦保護、當漁汛之際、除保護漁業治安外、並取締汽船强買及外籍漁船入領海捕魚、尙能實力干涉、日人越海捕魚之風、爲之少殺、近冀魯海洋漁業管理局在靑成立辦事處、租輪船二艘、從事保護、將來我國漁業當可逐漸發達也、（九月六日）</p>

<h3>落魄塾師突遭暗殺</h3>
<p>週身被砍九刀大腸流出血如泉湧被害原因據云不類仇殺實近姦情</p>
<p>昨晨零點三十分、閘北四區警署轄境内談家橋蘇家巷地方、發生一暗殺案、被殺者爲一窮塾師、茲將調查所得、紀述於後、</p>
<h3>落魄塾師</h3>
<p>儲仲夫、江北泰縣人、年三十九歲、稍有學識、並略通醫道、據悉在原籍已娶妻並生有子女數人、前年間彼此忽發生意見、乃賦仳離、儲即隻身來滬、惟赤手空拳、難以立足、乃憑其所學、在大統路底新營盤談家橋蘇家巷空地上、擺設測字灘、賴其三寸不爛之舌、爲一班迷信卜休咎、雖不門庭店市、但所入亦堪溫飽、同時鄰人見儲舉止安詳、頗有斯文落魄可憐之感、乃慫恿儲設館訓蒙、儲爲心動、乃</p>
<h3>窮困可憐</h3>
<p>向該處綽號錢道人（名裕勤）鹽城人、已年逾知命、商借餘屋一間、作爲課讀起居之處、附近貧民子弟高學者、亦有二十餘名、同時儲更爲人醫疾、或爲兒童施種牛痘、故三年來雖不能豐衣足食、但亦已衣食無憂、儲並與錢甚爲交好、據悉儲因此曾拜錢裕勤爲師、並長齋禮佛、唸誦不輟、但其臥處則僅木板二塊、此外可稱一無長物、詎亦被偷兒埀靑、竟於某晚乘儲外宿時竊去、嗣後儲即不再備、入晚僅用長凳三隻、拚成臨時臥舖、</p>
<h3>突然慘死</h3>
<p>前晚（四日）儲又外出、直至五日晨七時始返、當日午後四時、重復外出、至晚間八時回家、面現憤憤之色、當時即取小凳一隻坐於户外納凉、亦未與任何人交談一語、未幾即歸寢、詎至昨晨零點三十分左右、錢裕勤之妻蕭氏現年四十八歲、正在酣睡時、忽聞門外犬吠之聲大作、同時儲之臥處亦發生聲響、意爲偷兒再度光臨、蕭氏乃急披衣起視、則見門户洞開、羣犬狂吠不已、四出探視、一無所得、乃返身進屋、則見儲之臥房門亦被打開同時呼之不應、亟入内探視、則見儲已死於臨時臥舗之上、鮮血直流、濺佈滿地、</p>
<h3>共砍九刀</h3>
<p>蕭氏見狀大駭、奔入該氏臥室、亟將其夫錢裕勤喚醒、再同出觀探、則見儲身上穿白色汗衫、下身赤露、無袴、腸亦流出腹外、厥狀至爲慘酷、乃急往投報談家橋四區派出所、當由該所葛巡長等前往查勘、同時四區總署亦派徐維江前往調查、發覺死者共被砍九刀計頭部三刀、面部一刀、左右頸間兩刀、腹部一刀、胸部一刀、右手一刀、中指已斷、腸已流出、頭顱因兩頸砍處甚深、故幾將斷落、警員等查悉死狀後、即返所報告、一面着地保往役地院請騐、一面即將錢裕勤夫婦傳署訊問、</p>
<h3>原因揣測</h3>
<p>據蕭氏在四區警署供稱、死者生前外宿不歸、實因其有情婦之故、問其如何得知、則支吾不答、同時四鄰亦投警署報告、據稱斯案發生、該蕭氏實有重大嫌疑、因此警署即將蕭氏暫行覊押、一面即通飭所屬四出追緝兇手、務獲究辦、並悉死者原籍尙有兄嫂、已由其居鄰設法通知來滬料理身後云、至於斯案眞相、依旁觀者猜測、不類仇殺、實近姦情、</p>

<h3>中國國貨之運命</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>中國最近的提倡國貨，可謂聲嘶力竭，極盡努力之能事矣。顧自一二八以來，日日言抵制日貨，服用國貨，報紙所記數，會塲所講演，街頭所宣傳，試問究竟抵制日貨多少？服用國貨多少？國人有精確之調查乎？詳細之統計乎？我人如果一爲考究，誠不知汗流浹背，惶愧至於無地？蓋一年之成績，既無損於日人之毫末，反助長其猖獗，日人嘗謂去年一年在華市場所受抵貨之數目，在南洋印度之所銷，已二倍於此數，曾何足有絲毫顧慮，其言雖不免失於誇，顧事實如此，何可爲　。友人自日本歸者，爲言日本人之提倡國貨雖無國家統制之名，已有同業統制之實，其所採方策有六：</p>
<p>㈠生產限制　某種工廠，就其需要量，假定必須十家，則不許有十家以上之設立，以免供過於求，致起跌價競爭，反不能立於穩固之地位。</p>
<p>㈡分業分工　某一工業，除同種製造外，有聯帶關係者，如冶鐵，如鍊鋼，如裝置，采用分工合作辦法，以謀經濟。</p>
<p>㈢共同購買原料　由聯合機關，向同一地方採購原料，負責運輸，價既低廉，運貨迅速。</p>
<p>㈣研究减低成本　由各廠延攬人才，注意於出品之精進，成本之减輕。</p>
<p>㈤注意輸出組合　日本輸出組合，在全世界有一百四十餘處，着着進行，無孔不入。對華輸出組合，有四十餘處，政府竭力獎勵，去年一年，補助遠東之輸入組合，有一百八十萬元。所定辦法有三：不許無謂競爭，不許任意漲跌價目，不許侵奪營業地位。其調查費之支出，從不吝惜，各業派人之旅費，亦有由政府補助者，其用心可知。</p>
<p>㈥注意販賣組合　同業公會，權力極大，政府與同業公會，目下一致注意於販賣商之活動，最近運動荷蘭，爪哇，印度，新加坡商人爲之販賣，以極低廉之價格，極優厚之利益，多方引誘，已大收成效。</p>
<p>在日本國内，幾已到處服用國貨，顧其政府猶設立振興國貨委員會，規定國貨紀念節，報紙所宣傳，雜誌所披露，以及會塲路上，到處有提倡國貨之意旨。最近政府召集各部長官各業專家，研究日本目下所用之非國貨，尙有一百四十餘種，經多方研究之下，内有一百二十餘種，可以國貨替代，僅二十種，暫時不得不用外貨，其注意力可知。最近張公礶先生赴日游覽，其所見所聞，類多如此，人進我退，人刀俎，吾魚肉，人已磨厲以須，我却漠然無動，中國國貨之運命如此，可痛孰甚。又謂日本政府機關，購用物品，如果採辦者掉以輕心，誤用外貨，則不予報銷，以示懲戒，官</p>
<p>民合和之精神如此，我國人能無動心否乎？</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>國貨工廠的生死問題</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>有一位很有經騐的工業家他說：在國貨年中，大家都說話好，依我看來國貨前途，已到没有救藥的地步，如果再不改良下去，恐怕不出五年，都要關門大吉，他說了這種殺風景的話我倒問他一個究竟，他說事實如此，是無可諱言的。你把中國的國貨工廠，和人家比一比，第一是資本不如人，第二是學理不如人，第三是經騐不如人，第四是辦事的團結力不如人，第五是成本便宜不如人，第六是出品不好不如人，已覺萬分的危險，萬分的可憐。再加世界各國，目下都是感覺到生產過剩，甲的出品，休想銷到乙的國裏，乙的出品，拼命的要推銷到工業幼稚的國家，大家要找出路，找來找去，只有中國還可以轉轉念頭。做他們出品的宅閭。你也如此，他也如此，結果他們都深溝高壘以關稅爲惟一武器，便把中國作世界各國推銷他們國貨的惟一市塲。可憐中國人，一些没有法子去和他們奮鬥，一些没有準備去應付他們，結果中國貨的工廠還有存在的餘地麽？</p>
<h3>婦女心目中的國貨</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>市上商品的最大主顧，當然要推一般婦女了，一九三二年時代之輪，還未曾過去，就在找購一九三三年的新出品了，這種時代前奏曲的婦女，却都是有智識的優閒階級，摩登女學生，貴族小姐等，她們對於國貨，既没有正確的認識，而國貨亦没有標準給她們做目標，於是乎她們不覺自然而然地，充任帝國主義者洋貨的義務推銷員了！這種風氣，會蔓延及於在工廠作勞工的女工和内地婦女，效顰大都市婦女的狂熱，多麽痛心？</p>
<p>提倡國貨····鬧了好幾年，簡直是聽得膩煩了，到現在纔跟着時代之輪，漸漸的進展，國貨週，國貨年，國貨商塲，國貨公司，消費合作社，大家通力合作，喊着，做着，可是在婦女心目中的國貨，依然是劉意在海上著名的三大公司裏，我們試分别去巡禮一回，熱鬧冷落，是顯而易見的事實，一般婦女，所歡迎的國貨公司，是數一數二，寥若晨星，心目中樂與往還的，大概只有幾家著名的國貨商店，現在纔漸漸注意到中國國貨公司，不知能否有恒心，永遠認得淸，還是一個疑問！</p>
<h3>國貨的三個時代</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>在一直從前海禁未開的時候，中國人一切服用所需，都是中國人自己的原料，自己的製造，這可說是一個純粹的國貨時代，也可說是國貨第一時代。</p>
<p>海禁開後，一般人感到外貨的式樣美觀，取用便利，就把意志轉變了方向，一致購用外貨了，後來有一般人，詳細地把外貨觀察一下，覺得它的構造和仿製，並没有十分難處，於是去向它們的原料商，飯店回葱般的購買原料，再請了它們的技師，（指外藉技師）來依樣葫蘆的製造，這可說是國貨模仿時代，也可說是國貨第二時代。</p>
<p>一直到現在，中國人頭腦淸醒的是很多了，他們深切地知道，這樣的模仿人家，購買人家的原料，來粗製濫造，供給國人，你想在這樣潮流之下的中國人，覽别力是如何精審，他難道還要來用你那棧的粗製濫造的出品呢？所以他們頭腦是比較淸新，他們要研究原料是產自何地？中國境内，倒底有没有？出品式樣，要如何纔能適合一般人，出品質地，要如何纔能堅固耐用，出品銷路，要如何纔能暢行無阻，這樣地細加研究，精益求精，那怕他的出品，還不能在國貨界立足呢！</p>
<p>但是現在，依然還有像國貨第二時代的一般人存在，而且還模仿之惟恐不足，甚至一個化妝品的瓶樣，外貨是酒罐式的，我們也是酒罐式，裝瓶的盒子，它們是印黃色的，我們也印黃色的，這簡直是模仿得太像了，你不見報紙上常有外商控訴華商仿效訴訟的事情嗎？講到結果，不是將仿效的出品，全數充公，就是勒令停業，這雖然是帝國主義者的手段，可是中國的的曲意模仿，也確實是眞的。</p>
<p>這眞是一句萬分傷心的話，在國貨中除了　有的出品，未能十分加以改良外；其他可說是十分之九是模仿外貨的出品，所以我早已說過，國貨要從創造一方面去着想，製造出來的東西，應該要超越一切，非但要勝過國内所有出品，還要駕遇外貨而上之，那纔迎合現代的國人心理，假使一意從舊，失敗就在服前了。</p>
<p>一般經營國貨事業者，大都是商人居多，雖然智識超羣的也有，可是祗國牟利，不顧一切的人，也着實不少，惟其如此，他的出品，因循苟且，永没有發達的日子，我以爲要想出品的能夠暢銷，在種種方面都應當下功夫去做。</p>
<p>國内研究工藝美術的人，確實太少，政府並没有獎勵的辦法，所以埋没了許多英才，如其經營國貨事業者，能夠和研究工藝美術的人，聯絡一致，創造出許多特異的出品，定能使國人震驚一下呢！</p>
<p>以現在的情形來說，實在是個國貨混合時代，也可說是國貨第三時代。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>國貨的「旺月」</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>七八月，（陰歷）是各地辦貨的時候了，同時，也是我們國貨工廠貨品暢銷内地的時候了，上海商塲上，有一切很普遍的俗語，呌做「旺月」，這大概就是指上春的二三月，和現在的七八月丨因爲這幾個月的營業旺盛，異於尋常月份而說的，但是，在這個時候，農村破產，内地經濟崩潰，萬分不景氣的嘗兒，再加上黃河水災，西北營業，大受打擊，各地的莊客們，雖然總也要照例的出來辦一次貨，裝運回去，以作下半年的出售，然而，影響所及，舉目盡非，種種不良現象，也就隨之發生，在這「旺月」的惠賜下，已有下列的發現：</p>
<p>關於顧客方面的：㈠次貨盛銷這是可以證實現下一般民衆購買力薄弱的已趨其極了·放棄頭號的貨物不添，活動市面上却儘惟次貨是銷，國貨衰落，此實主因·</p>

<h3>提倡國貨與民衆敎育</h3>
<p>— 邢廣益</p>
<p>我對於敎育有一種懐疑：就是敎育程度愈高的人，用外國貨的愈多，好像中國的敎育祗是敎學生用外國貨似的，這種觀察是以敎育程度與消用國貨爲正比例的事實而證明的，那末乾脆的說，這種敎育李批幹嗎？</p>
<p>現在提倡國貨的聲浪，風起雲湧，大家對於提倡國貨討論得很多，可是對於國貨與敎育本身的關係，尤其是民衆敎育，還没有人注意，</p>
<p>好像敎育的目的就是做官和攫取金錢，祗要有金錢，就没有辦不到的事，於是但求不勞而獲，鄙視生產製造，外邊更有價廉物美嬌艶玲瓏的外國貨，眩耀吾們的眼簾，於是這種印象深刻在國人的腦海中，自然而然的對外貨增加信仰而受外貨的引誘，敎育的普及又何能力抵狂瀾呢？有人這樣說·「國貨要推銷到鄉村去丨」我當然也承認的，不過要怎樣纔能把國貨推銷到鄉村去，却是一個問題，决不是憑空可以做到的，這裏我們所最要注意的民衆敎育了！</p>
<p>吾國的文盲這樣多，民衆多半是無智無識，他們不知道什麽是「國貨」，民衆敎育當前的問題，就是提高民智，增加生產，不過提高民智决不是由鄉村引導到城市，由大布而至用巴黎綢，由旱烟管而至大英牌，以至洋浊，洋火，洋燭，洋磁，洋布洋緞，洋傘···以及一切洋化，如果這樣提高民智，民智愈提高，國貨愈危困了！</p>
<p>在現狀之下，今後的民衆敎育應如何改定方針，實施「國貨敎育」！拿敎育當作解决國家迫切重大問題的方法，似乎不甚恰當，其實時代需要的不同，敎育設施不能不隨之轉變，而且敎育最大的目的在國富民强，提倡國貨却是富國之道啊！</p>
<h3>國貨業應如何避免倒帳芻議</h3>
<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>丨貢獻幾點幼稚的意見丨</p>
<p>時局這樣的擾攘不寗，社會經濟這樣的窘促不安，處此天患人禍下的國貨業，正像一個先天不足的嬰孩，生後又没有一點滋肥的營養。尤其是一部份國貨工廠，剛剛在資金短絀千補百縫中辦得稍有成績，立住脚跟，爲了連受幾次客户巨額的倒帳，以致周轉不靈宣告破產，或者有人想繼續接辦下去，但前塵的影象太壞，不敢再抱危險，於是擁巨產者不思多量投資，正在從事國貨事業者旦夕惴惴然預防倒欠的　臨，羣相裏足，遑論進展，國貨命脈，因之愈形迫促，這眞是一件太痛心的事啊！</p>
<p>因爲商塲沿革的慣例如此，想把出品遠近推行就必得放客帳，如果做生意都要人家準備了現洋來採買你的貨，這是不可能的。近年來國貨同業一天天的</p>
<h3>本刋特闢國貨工廠廣告專欄啟事</h3>
<p>本刋爲宣揚國貨出品，促進產銷合作起見，特闢國貨工廠專欄，以便採購國貨者易於檢閱。此項廣告，地位經濟，扼要顯明，如荷國貨工廠　賜登，極爲歡迎，敬希公鑒！　申報國貨週刋部啟</p>

<p>參觀筆記</p>
<h3>大華火柴廠參觀記</h3>
<p>說來眞是很慚愧的呢！洋貨的充寒於國内，使你在任何一個環境内，都可以發現出許多；甚至在你的身上，也許也可以發現不少！是的，在工業没有發達，實業没有振興的今日中國，你去考察一般的國民吧，大多數的同胞，在他們的生活上，在在都可以檢查得出有許多的外貨呢！事實上，你不去問他們爲什麽要愛用外貨的問題，也不難想像出個中的原因呵！價格的太貴，感是貨色的不好：更或是一向的購用，到也慣了；什麽是提倡國貨？他們會這樣回答你！</p>
<p>自己是一個智識分子，看到同胞們的愛用外貨，除了相當的勸導改用國貨之外，心裏祇有悲痛；更悲痛的，是有許多的智識份子，把國貨與洋貨的購用問題，也不當其爲一件重大的事情了！</p>
<p>公務之暇，輟擬要去參觀參觀國貨的廠商：目的，乃是要在兒童的内心裏，打下愛用國貨的椿子；可是爲了工作的繁冗，課卷的批改，每有所願，而爲時所制也。這次因爲學校還没開學，得友人茅君沈君之介紹，乃得輪渡至上海浦東的六里橋，而有參觀大華火柴廠之舉焉。爰誌觀時所憶於後：</p>
<p>該廠位於六里橋之西，距上海，僅以一江之隔，交通尙稱便利。予與茅沈兩君，走至門房，門房即以通知報内；不一刻，彼即取通行證三枚授予，更由考工部主任陳君寒劍之領導，乃得參觀廠内所有之設與工作也。</p>
<p>先至整梗部，見無數雜亂之火柴梗，堆積屋内；兩工人運用一機器，復有一工人將雜亂之柴梗，倒於其上，則不一刻，乃均整齊；柴梗整齊後，更有數童工，將柴梗齊齊的盛於方盤内，意蓋要拿出去，放入另一機器，將其不均不整者，有以除去也！同屋之一隅，另有兩工人，管理兩機器；彼之工作，乃爲將一頭兩柴梗之火柴，及其他異形之火柴除去也！整梗部，陳君謂，製火柴之第一步手續也。</p>
<p>旋至第二間廠内，則部份很多，有以梗之粗細者除去：有以盤内柴梗高低不平者壓平之。將柴梗裝整盤内之後，乃有數工人，將柴梗之頭部上腹，意即促其火柴之易於燃燒也；陳君謂後，予乃恍然知瞭於火柴梗之有黃白兩部份顯明之顏色也！臘盤大而平整，油煎鹿鹿，工人將柴梗稍一浸沾，則頃刻即可上燐矣；燐由藥配，燐由機器配成後，即復傾入一大機盤内磨細，蓋不如此，則所作成之火柴，每有爆裂或其他之劣點也。燐上後。即取至烘乾部，蔣其烘乾裝盒；烘乾室内，裝火爐一，上復有電扇一；陳君謂，裝電扇之用意，乃將火爐旁之熱度，有以平均的發散於室之四周；如此，則火柴之黑頭，美觀且有光彩；不然，則電扇不裝，近於火爐之炎柴，每有黑頭乾　而僵硬之弊云。</p>
<p>後至裝盒部，見兩大間内，很多女工，均在裝盒；屋内有一路，路左裝大盒，路右裝小盒；大盒爲馬牌，暢銷於中國東南諸省；小盒爲大砲牌，暢銷及於華南華北云。詢諸陳君，商標有幾種，則爲很多也。由裝盒部至包紥部，則又有很多女工，手脚很快的將十盒火柴，一包包包將起來；予乃嘖嘖稱快；陳君答曰，熟能生巧，包以價計，多做則工錢亦多也。室之另一隅，則有以竹片乃竹笠作大包者，裝至外埠，則不致如裝箱之有走濕者也！</p>
<p>該廠日出五六十大包，合計有數萬盒之多；刻該廠復大興土木，添建廠屋，以事擴充；廠内有圖書館，有消防隊，有工人夜校，有運動塲，有小花園；工人宿舍，亦甚整潔；勞資兩方，感情又多融洽；蓋資方力謀勞工之幸福；勞方亦以盡力增多產量！更有誌者，即該廠之夜校敎室，即爲膳廳，廳内之坐凳爲方形之圈，圈内有四根木，用時將板按上即得！</p>
<p>予以時間關係，不能詳細參觀，引爲憾也！</p>
<p>加增，競爭也愈演愈烈，在互相逐鹿之下，羣以多做生意爲前提，無暇計及客户信用經濟程度，一般營業員大都來者不拒，大放其帳，及至收欵期屆，則疑難百出，呆帳時聞，不佞服務某國貨工廠，目擊此類事件很多，事後加以推敲，覺得處於這種情勢之下，在可能範圍内似科有極力想出補救倒帳方法的必要，於是很簡單的提出下面幾點幼稚的見解：</p>
<p>（甲）營業員負審察的責任　國貨工廠的營業員本身應該了解，自己不僅僅乎兜得了大批營業算已完了責任，實際上他的任務是要到收欵舒齊才算終了，因爲内部人員是不熟悉客户店基是否殷實，經濟是否舒裕，都憑營業員的報告作放帳根據，營業員如果毫無審愼的目光精密的手段，那對於放帳的安全很有關係，八昔商場的習俗，認爲營業員毌庸充足的知識，祇須兜得掉出品就夠，但在眼前這種社會情形複雜，商情瞬息千變之中，營業員實在應有知能和經騐的蓄養。</p>
<p>（乙）客户經濟狀况測騐表　我們時時看見有許多歷史很多信譽很好的店號，也會突然的收歇淸理，在事前的確找不到預防的方法，但有一種很輕便的辦法，可以補救萬一的，就是把每個客户歷年來交往的事實，做一個有系統的表格，表内詳列該客户發貨和收欵的日期，付欵是否爽鈍，票期的長短，我們在這記載内可以测見該客户基礎的幼稚或雄厚，經濟程度變化得怎樣？譬如說：近來該店發貨和來欵的日期相離很遠，期票的期限很長，那一定曉得該客户近來已不如從前的可靠，應加以考慮或緊催帳欵，倘若没有表格來顯示，單憑空泛的理想來估量，那是很危險的。</p>
<p>（丙）同業間相互監理營業　眼前任何同業，都競爭得烏烟瘴氣，明盤暗扣不必說，刦　營業區域也很起勁，結果造成飢不擇食，有求必應的局面，同業間既不開誠合作，更談不到互通消息，於是我覺得相互監理營業的辦法眞是刻不容緩，因爲同業與同業有了監查營業的組織，一般營業人員才有了互相探討問訊的機會，客帳也多一層集思廣益詳加審查的手續，無形中多一點放帳的保障，而且這個組織，直接可以免除營業競爭，大家取同一步伐，這是一舉兩得的事。</p>
<p>上面三個没有系統的貢獻，自己覺得非常幼稚，並且商塲中，有許多倒帳事件的造成，是出乎意料以外的，事實上没有未卜先知的秘訣，進一步說，想擴大營業，不得不多放客帳，想少受損失，倒又覺得少放客賬爲上策，在這種絕對矛盾情形之下，的確使從事國貨業的營業人員很感受痛苦。我很歡迎大家來討論討論關於這類的問題，因爲這些都是我們身許國貨的同志們所應盡的義務！</p>
<h3>國貨事業之聯合營業與澈底合併</h3>
<p>— 勛</p>
<p>展開國貨事業的歷史來瞧，其所以奄奄一息日暮途窮到現在這局面；外貨傾銷管理制度不良，當然是一重大原因，此外同業傾軋長年爭鬥，弄得兩敗俱傷，確也是一個致命傷；縱使表面上有着同業必需遵行的規程，再有着麻木不仁的公會，但是同床異夢各自爲政的競爭，却愈形劇烈，在眼前天天嚷着減工緊縮不景氣的年頭，再没有一個具體方法來打一下强心針，那正和一位外創累累的病夫，内部又蔓延着肺病同樣的危險。</p>
<p>有很少已經覺悟了的國貨同樣，在最近二三年來，曾經突破重圍似的創立一個聯合營業的組織，這個組織是聯絡同業設一個總的發行機關，在工廠領袖人員共同負責之下，收營業步伐一致的效力，我們從事實上加以批判，覺得這個組織所貢獻給一個事業的利益果是很大，但從整個合作的立塲上說來，這還是一個很片面很幼稚的動機，而不是永久的歸宿點。</p>
<p>因爲單單把營業聯合是不足團結一個事業的力量，更因爲各工廠利害觀念不能消除，還存有爭先恐後的念頭，我們敢檢查眼前幾個國貨事業的聯合營業機關，他既不能完全搜羅同業參加，而創立未久即告失敗，曇花一現的又復不少，能得細長命脈斷續努力的正是少數。</p>
<p>如果爲了營業聯合不能整個收效而廢除，因廢除而回復未聯合時我行我素，得復閙起同業競爭的故態，這是根本没法救治的，我們要明瞭聯合營業至少是有集思廣益步驟有律的長處，必得從這一個初步的組織加以研究，進一步的想法來一個澈底的合作，怎樣澈底法呢？那就是步武歐美實業後塵，來實行同業合併。</p>
<p>在我國實業界，同業合併實不多見，可以說没有，這的確是一件繁複重大的事，各個工廠都有各個根本的立塲和内部資產股務上的問題，合併的時候多少終有輕重的地方，要是放大眼光，希望在未來過程上蒸蒸日上没有爭奪的現象，那末籌設期間所耗用於麻煩上的金錢時間，算來很値得的。</p>
<p>同業合併成功，營業劃一不必說，出品上也大有採長補短的優點，後起的同業陸續扶助收併，社會的認識亦趨於專一，對於抵制外貨上，更有充厚的精神才力不致顧慮。</p>
<p>我相信聯合營業是同業合併的基礎，已經聯合營業的組織趕快準備起來，其他一切同業，閙得烏烟瘴氣的，也該切實下一番注意。</p>

<h3>一椿不經意的錯誤</h3>
<p>— 藍田</p>
<p>這個年頭兒，一般先生們的口頭上和文字上，作提倡國貨有力的宣傳，眞熱心愛國，可算得不遺餘力的了，可是他們很少有人注意到，一件極小而極平常的事，會使十餘年以後的人，以糢糊的印象，紊雜的思想，對於國貨，不會發生痛癢的。這又是什麽呢？原來中國人自從被帝國主義用武力征復開埠通商以來，又用種種的經濟政策來制服我們，使我們一向以蔑視的心理轉變到崇拜的心理；似乎物質的文明，祗有洋大人能夠創造和發明，中國人是永遠趕不上的，因此，無論這種貨是由外國來而經過中國自己改造過的·或是本國自己做的，新頴奪目點，就不辨是非，統名之曰「洋」，如細軟的紗和布喊做「洋」紗「洋」布，細潔的線和繩喊做「洋線」和「洋」頭繩，晴天用的布傘子呌「洋」傘，琺瑯做的呌「洋」磁，有線芯的燭喊做「洋」臘燭，小刀呌「洋」刀，綫襪呌「洋」襪，革履呌「洋」鞋，····這裏我一時也寫不了許多。雖明知其爲本國出品，以習慣上的困循，無心的脫口，把國貨的本身湮没在大「洋」海之底了。</p>
<p>一般未受過敎育的文盲，也難怪他們脫口「洋」閉口「洋」吧！可是處身於國貨界服務少數的人，或身負以敎育底使命來造成中國未來的主人翁的一般小學敎師們，和家庭的家長們，也同樣的盲從地喊，這却未免太笑話了吧？</p>
<h3>快買國貨去丨</h3>
<p>— 黃模廢</p>
<p>大陸商塲上，國貨公司褒，色色備，樣樣齊，</p>
<p>物是多麽美，價是多麽低丨我們去買那東西來吃，穿，用，眞覺得：丨又愛國，又衰意，又便宜！大家快買去，快向那「國貨總庫」裏買去！日本人用桃子敎小孩，說明桃子是中國某地所出，其目的在暗示兒童得到深刻的印象，非把產挑子的地方奪來，是没有吃桃子丨丨生存丨丨的希望；可是中國人敎小孩又怎麽樣？明明這件東西是中國貨，却弄得糊裏糊塗，莫明其妙丨本來許多東西，有的起先確是從外國傳進來的，然在目前由中國人自己發明或仿造的國貨也很多了，又何以要「指鹿爲馬」還要把個「洋」字放上去？難道除了外國人會造「洋」貨，中國人就不會造出「國」來貨？所希望以後服務於國貨界的人，學校的敎師，家庭的家長，須要注意這個，如果有小的事上忽視了，要使國貨受着一種不良的影響，也就是我們自己多造成一種恥辱咧。</p>
<p>國貨介紹</p>
<h3>兩段値得介紹的事</h3>
<p>— 俞友淸</p>
<p>恕我健忘。不知道那本英文小說中。說一個德國人。爲了歐戰以後。人民的剌激。受了又深一步。所以德僑在别國地方。更加熱心愛國。提倡國貨了。那個德國人。住在英國地方。一日吸的香烟完了。一時祖國没有購到寄來。他走遍倫敦城中。要買德國的香烟。找尋了多時。好容易被他在一爿小雜貨店中。購到了一包長久没有人詢問的香烟。他欣喜若狂。快樂得非凡。後來一問小雜貨店的主人。也是德僑。他的香烟。預備自己吸的。看見有人來買。十分奇怪。就把自己常吸的香烟。分了一包給買烟人。後來成功了一個國外的好友。這些事實。是否眞確。我不去說他。覺得德國人的愛國。和提倡國貨。無微不至了。回顧我們中國的人們。以爲不吸外國香烟。不足以示闊。甚至於還要吸來路貨的雪茄烟咧。彼此相較。中國人太没有愛國的心了。</p>
<p>我又記得一個朋友說。他是從前寄居在日本。有十多年了。并且擔任了日本某百貨公司的職務。他相見了我。常常說。中國人太没有愛國心了。日本寄居中國的僑民。他們用的東西。都是本國的。甚至於爲了一隻牙刷。或一包牙粉。都要寫信到祖國來買。這是何等愛用國貨。但是中國人適得其反。以爲不是舶來品來路貨。不足以表示他是摩登人物。恨不得樣樣學外國人。可惜他的眼睛不綠。皮膚不是天然白。否則他一定說。我是歐美的民族。中國太没有進步了。從這點看來。日本的强。不是意外事。看了民衆的愛國。就可以知道的了。中國人。醒醒吧。</p>

<h3>婚變</h3>
<p>— 徐紅霞</p>
<p>胡達哉和何琴芳女士訂婚的消息，傳到朋友們的耳鼓裏，大家都認爲是意想不到的事。</p>
<p>的確，在他倆一切的情形看來，是永無訂婚的可能性，何女士是一個有錢有勢，受過大學敎育的小姐，胡達哉是一個「上無片瓦庶身，下無立錐之地」的窮小子，兩人的懇殊，大有「三十三天與十八層地獄」之比。</p>
<p>何女士本來有一個愛人，是日本法學博士吳君仁，家道也很可意，朋友們都斷定他倆的婚事，是不會有變的。</p>
<p>前幾天，何女士分函胡達哉和吳君仁，請他們各送他一件夏衣，吳君仁得到了信，趕緊跑到Ｘ公司去購了一件粉血色的Ｘ國貨的綢旗袍料親自送了去。</p>
<p>胡達哉接了信，頓時發現經濟的恐慌，並且感覺得何女士故意的和窮人爲難，好久没有往還了，爲什麽今天硬要一件衣料，摸一摸口袋，只餘一塊幾角錢，買衣料當然是談不到。</p>
<p>左思右想，連晚飯都没心吃，向朋友設法告貸了兩塊錢，跑到ＸＸ國貨公司購買了一件抗日紗的旗袍料，自己不好意思送去，特地着人送給何女士。第二天吳君仁收到何女士的一封信，信裏說：</p>
<p>「君仁君：</p>
<p>蒙賜夏衣一襲，感謝莫名，細察該貨、乃仇貨，君購此貨，正助仇人以經濟，購買炸彈，殺我同胞，奪我土地，粉紅之色，非象徵同胞之鮮血乎。芳不忍着，茲特遣价原璧奉上，國難至此，君尙購仇貨，非芳之友，請從此以後，勿再往還！順祝醒悟　何琴芳上八月十日」</p>
<p>於是，第二天何琴芳親自跑到胡達哉的寓所，一方面答謝他的厚意，一方面徵求他的同意，當天，就在强華飯店舉行訂婚禮了。</p>

<p>上海市立圖書館最近籌備圖書流通、並擬擴充館址、另建藏書樓、分誌如下、</p>

<h3>籌建書庫</h3>

<h3>陳柱尊對於影印四庫珍本之意見</h3>
<p>近來商務書館與敎育部商訂選印四庫珍本、海内學者頗多意見、記者昨晤陳柱尊敎授、詢其意見、陳氏謂既名爲選印四庫全書珍本、則自當以四庫全書本爲範圍、俾世人得窺四庫本之眞面目、若别擇古本善本以代之、則不得冠以四庫之名、且往時商務書館、曾影印四部叢刋、績古逸叢書、及發行百衲本廿四史之預約矣、此等書、隨海内士人或商家自由搜輯刋行可耳、既非取自官本、則無須與政府訂立約章、亦無庸公開討論、今所以與政府訂約、受公開之討論者、正以其爲採自國家所藏之四庫全書耳、舍四庫之本而不刋、則爲佚出題外之文章矣、至謂作校勘記、亦爲學者讀書之事、非印書者之責且當今能覓幾個阮文達乎、若必待各書之校勘記成、而後印書、事恐永遠無期矣、鄙意影印古書、最要是不許失眞、響如影印古畫、卽有損壞蟲食、亦不妄塡一點、妄加一筆、故所影印之書、卽有錯字、亦不宜改、誠恐淺人或以不誤爲誤也、故影印古書、第一不得有意塡改、第二又須防其無意之錯誤、因影印時字畫不眞、製版時往往誤改、如其字譌作共、夫字訛作天之類、往往有之、此不得不望於影印時、特别加意校勘也、至於何書爲珍本、爲有價値、則又有賴於通儒之選擇、然通儒非必藏書家、藏書家亦非必爲通儒、是又不可不知也、</p>

<p>强華籃球隊昨以一分之差、亦敗於南京靑光隊、</p>
<p>比數爲三十五比三十六、强華若早以詐文奎出塲、結果或爲相反、亦未可知、查靑光在滬、已四戰四勝、風頭可謂極盛、現秩序已結束、該隊定今日奏凱返京、自始至終、局勢異常緊張、强華自以六比五佔先後、靑光聲勢忽順、連連投中、以十六比八佔優於上半時、强華所得八分、全爲誠景星一人投中、下半時起、靑光魏海靑連中三元、强華遭此打擊、努力反攻、頗有得心應手之妙、比數反漸接近、一躍而成二十比二十二、强華僅落成兩分、於是形勢愈形緊張、競爭益見劇烈、以後又一度至二十六比二十五、但强華竟未能越一分之差、而始終屈居下風、最後成三十五比三十六時、靑光因四次暫停時間被罰、强華得意外之助、以爲不難罰進此分、而造平手、但誠景星一未中、結果靑光遂以一分幸勝、</p>

<p>而且，他們死的所在地，大都是旅館；死的方式，大都是「既醉既館」「以邀以遊」的回來，入房一睡，就此不起。「死的遺物，大都是遺有絕命書數封，其中之一，便是對於旅館老闃的道歉書；死的照片和遺書，大都可以刋入報紙，傳誦一時。要是死在内地旅館以及缺乏新聞材料的地方，那麽，當地報紙上面，差不多替死者出了一個專號，一切的一切，都是擴大宣傳，過了幾天以後，所有社論，和報屁股上的小品，凡自把來當做一種摩登化材料；這便是摩登化自殺的權威。</p>
<p>自殺，不是勇者所爲，既已自殺了，生命且犧牲，何事不可以犧牲？爲什麽要去累及旅館老闃？爲什麽要把絮絮叨叨的話去佔領報紙上新聞的園地？我閱粤報，載有龍山輪上少年夫婦自殺事，覺得比着摩登化的自殺乾凈了許多。</p>
<p>龍山輪由廣州啟行返香港，西餐樓十一號有陳姓少年夫婦，口操潮州語，男御薄絨西裝，女御時式旗袍，係前晚購有來回船票，由港上省，旋又由省回港者。是晚七時，兩人赴餐室進餐，餐費爲銀五元有奇，餐畢，返十一號房；直至八時，西餐部侍者入房，擬向他們收餐費，誰知闃其無人；侍者以爲他們出外散步，毫不生疑。九時許，重又入房，仍不見一人；遂在房中檢查，發覺一字條云；「我併不留遺書，不說什麽，遺下五元，就是還你們的餐費，其他東西，聽憑你們着落吧。」字樣甚爲端正，遺物中有一皮篋，内置衣飾外，又有廣東省銀行紙幣五元。至於，夫婦何時跳海，誰都不曾目擊，搭客們不過互相忖度罷了。他們同赴淸流，既不以遺屍累人，並且，遺下紙幣，恰如餐費；又没有摩登化的絕命書，僅云：「不說什麽」何等悲壯？何等灑脫？自殺不是勇者所爲，但這般自殺，畢竟比着摩登化自殺乾凈了許多。</p>
<h3>不平凡的鎭靜</h3>
<p>— 翼</p>
<p>前幾天，本埠發生了一件極平凡的槍殺案，用是甬人俞阿桂，被仇人槍擊。探捕查悉兇手匿居匯山路六號屋内，遂不圖聲色，密往兜拿。只見該屋前後門皆扃閉，破扉進去時、亦闃無一人，以爲兇手必是越屋頂逃逸。旋復察知係從灶披間跳下，匿於貼鄰陸順興翻砂作内。即赴該作察視，見有甬人項夏生，在地面熟臥，鞋上滿染泥跡，頗爲可疑。詢之作主，則又謂非在作工人。於是帶入捕房。捕頭詰問，項堅决不承，及帶往醫院，經被害人指明確係五兇手之一，項如俯首無詞。</p>
<p>在上海，這一類案子眞是再平凡没有了，幾乎天天有得發生。可是這一位兇手項最生，倒大大的不平凡，既機警，又鎭靜。探捕不動聲色而往，竟能預先由灶披間跳下，逃入貼鄰翻砂作，不但瞞過了探捕，且瞞過了翻砂作主和許多工人。及至探捕察知，到翻砂作察視，他竟又熟臥地上，如果不是「鞋上滿染泥跡」，可又要被他瞞過了。這個人的鎭靜工夫，實在超過機警，可稱得起「不平凡的鎭靜！」因爲探捕來了，想逃匿，原是匪人的本能行爲，只要逃得快，匿得妥便了：而臥在地上要裝成熟臥，不露破綻，那就非常不易。所以案情雖平凡，這個人的鎭靜工夫却不平凡，便大有表揚的價値。</p>
<p>然而在今日的中國，鎭靜是極端需要的，經在上者倡導，在下者奉行的結果，鎭靜已有成爲習慣之勢。匪人因有其個人的需要，這種工夫更容易練到爐火純靑。但話雖如此，匪人以之應用於瞞過探捕，終覺其褻凟丨鎭靜；假若全國人民都能練習成功，以之應用於國家大事，那纔敎在上者喜歡呢。</p>

<h3>江灣的鄉村生活</h3>
<p>— 胡菊絜</p>
<p>虚度了若干年日，　總算這一個星期日是最値得紀念的了，我們應當謝謝「快活的神仙」周世勳的賜給，爲了這一種的游玩，也許是會延年益壽的。</p>
<p>護到世勳，在我們朋友之中，經過公認他是最快活的一個，他有兩個應時的綽號，冬天他呌「咖啡館主」，夏天呌「愚園路巡閱使」，從這兩雅號上，已見到他生活的一般，最苦的便是他那張油嘴，是没有一分鐘停息的，除了他睡去了，可是他不開口便罷，一開口都是引得滿座大笑的。所以我加封他的油嘴呌「虎口」，在大衆談話之下，是難以有一個逃出他那「虎口的」，因了「快活」，健談的緣因，朋友們的游玩，總是不忘記世勳的，少了一個他，便會索然無味。</p>
<p>最近他的生活又有了小小的變遷了，從「都市」傾向倒「鄉村」，「乍浦」，「江灣」，或是「高橋」「東溝」老實不客氣的都被他認爲是他本人的樂園，自稱爲若干分主人翁之一。</p>
<p>上星期日，他預先約定了我，另外一位是沈衡莊，一位是章秋心，决定這一個星期日從鄉村生活中度過。到了這天，一個淸晨，我們三人就被世勳用柔和的手腕「驅逐出境」，沿着隱隱然有血痕的江灣路步行到江灣。一路疲極了，幸而我們四個人之中，有了這一個「袖珍」的金口，倒還不覺悶氣。</p>
<p>到達了江灣，歇脚晚香圃，這是世勳的令岳王仲衡先生的園子，佔地雖不甚廣，可是良田數傾，茅屋半椽，倒也覺得淸靜，至少可以隔絕了都市的塵囂。况且園子裏還有着鷄犬的點綴，十足的透示了鄉村生活的味兒，在這時我們四人，在農夫村婦的相形之下，反覺得自身的混俗。於是世勳傳令，全體解脫俗衣，同時全套農具各司其事，實行解甲歸田，嘗試些兒勞農的生活，大約是偶一爲之吧，我們覺得快活極了。</p>
<p>工作以後，園丁小毛把多量的熟玉蜀黍捧了上來，我們又共同收拾落英舖在草上席地而坐，世勳曰「此花裀也」可謂雅極，秋心最歡喜吃菜菓，大盤玉蜀黍，秋心竟吃了總數之半。</p>
<p>聚餐完畢了，由小毛領導，自備雨前，到鎭上小茶館去喝茶，這茶館呌做「江園」，　是江灣首屈一指的茶園，外觀惡極，裏面呢，却有雅座一間，是當地紳董的聚談之所。我們因時間的不衡突，忝爲座上客，沈衡莊好飲，頓時心血來潮想呷啤酒，委託小毛代辦，結果一個小時的張羅，全鎭祇有一瓶，於是我和秋心退出，世勳和衡莊對酌，我倆借了一副棋子對奕，不幸我倆没鬍子，否則且走且摸，眞是古味盎然呢。吃完了酒，走完了棋，傍晚了。小雀兒已紛紛的結伴歸巢了，我們還未盡興，又回到園子裏採了些紫葡萄解渴，把一個架上的葡萄幾乎吃盡了，才覺得痛快。於是我們也準備重回都市了。臨走世勳借花獻佛分送各人一盆秋色，這本兒是很好的，可异紫蘭色的葉子上讓了綠色的邊，世勳說，「這鄉姑娘染了都市的摩登化」了，這話了也覺有味。</p>
<p>回到北站，七點多了，彼此各奔東西，趕回家去了，雖然這是和各個妻子們的一個小别，倒也陡然想起閨中人的寂寞了，所以各人都歸以似箭，不加商榷的坐上了兩輪車向歸途而去，離鄉村可太遠了。</p>

<h3>潑臭料</h3>
<p>— 徐懋</p>
<p>讀了達夫先生的「傳記文學」，我想來談談另一種「傳記」丨丨伹不是「文學」。看近來的市塲上於那些「自唱自吹的自傳與帶襲帶抄的評傳」之外，還流行着什麽奇談秘記之類的文字。這些作者，常常捕捉些只有風影的事實，或是揑造些並無風影的謠言，利用人類的好奇心，矜爲獨得之秘，所以常常贏得廣大的讀者。這派的源流，出於以前的野史，上海灘上的一部分舊式文人，曾大加利用，不獨資茶餘酒後之談助，且作要挾中傷的手段。現在上海灘上的一部分新式文人，更其尖銳地加以利用，作爲達到某種目的之助力。因此，這雖不是「文學」，却確有點「武器的藝術」的意味了。</p>
<p>說是武器，其實也還是不對，因爲如果是武器，那麽應當一面是呼延灼的連環馬，另一面是徐寗的鈎鐮槍，一面是金人的狼牙棒，另一面是宋人的天靈蓋才對，而今則不然，人家原是手無寸鐵的，既加不上什麽罪名，而却要給以打擊，那怎麽辦呢？便只有「潑臭料」。</p>
<p>揭發陰私或揑造謠言這兩種手段，即是紹興人所謂「潑臭料」。料者肥料也，</p>
<p>把肥料潑到敵人身上，使第三者憎厭敵人的臭穢，這和現在的什麽奇談，秘記的製造家的心裁，正復相同。</p>
<p>胆力過人的壯士，遇着鈎鐮槍或狼牙棒，即使赤手空拳，也還可以冒死抵擋一下子，但如果對方用的是「臭料」，則無論他怎樣勇敢，也祗有悄然退走了。「潑臭料」的文學家們，能夠得意一時，是毫不足奇的。</p>
<h3>從「用武之地」到「環境」</h3>
<p>— 索原</p>
<p>讀了前天錢歌川先生的文章，對於錢先生等的「環境也不許我們全然抛棄英語，」而「只好」「八五運動」的苦衷，非常同情，因此頗後悔自己的多事了。如果錢先生等對於他們「環境」早些表白的話，我是决不敢妄加批評的。但既已承賜覆，而在「全國的學者」尙未代表錢先生等前來「代爲答覆」之前，我只得和錢先生再來談一下。</p>
<p>先輩出錢先生文章中很重要的兩點：㈠基本英語並非國際語一·張夢麟先生的「英語八五運動與基本英語，」二·其中所引首創者奥格登的話，三·基本英語「入門」及「文法」兩書，以及西·刋在各雜誌報紙上的基本英語的廣告，都是口口聲聲認定基本英語爲國際語的。而現在錢先生告白了，基本英語只是「在英語的範圍内，求簡易的捷徑」而已。因爲是「在英語的範圍内」的「捷徑」，所以决不是可與英語並立而更取而代之的英語合理化方案，更不能做較高一級（言語發展階段上的級）的國際語，已是非常明顯的了。所以它只是與原來的英語不可分離的，一種英語學習法，或「捷徑」而已。</p>
<p>（二）「各有短長，各有園地」在張夢麟先生</p>
<p>的文章内，已斷定世界語（Esperanto）的罪狀：一·是「人爲的，死的東西，」二·學時「等於另學一種外國語，」三·「而且它没有祖國，卽學出來，也没有用武之地，」「所以不能號召了。」而現在錢先生告白了：「Esperanto與英語，各有短長，各有園地，」「我並未因學過英語而反對Esperanto」。這里，錢先生已確認Esperanto之存在，表示「並未」「反對」，且認爲兩者「不僅互不相侵，而且不妨兼收並學」的。</p>
<p>對於以上的兩點，在大體上我是同意的。以下再舉出未能同意的幾點，加以答辯：</p>
<p>㈠錢先生說：「我想Esperanto的同志，也當然不會因爲自己學的Esperanto，而攻擊英語罷。」我的答覆：我的文章以及我所讀到的批評基本英語的文章（論語，濤聲，北平世界日報，上海晨報）内，從未有人對英語本身有過半個字的攻擊。我所反對的是：一·企圖作爲國際語的基本英語（「祖國」「用武之地」），二·企圖作爲英語合理化方案的基本英語（「英語合理化與基本英語」）。錢先生即用了「掉包」的方法，與我胡纒。而對於我的主張的要點，並未答覆。據說因爲「有事實可以證明」，所以「不願」「紙上空談」云。</p>
<p>（二）錢先生引用了我的「不能不說是完全失敗了」，企圖暗示我是怎樣武斷。其實我的原文並不如所引的簡單。我是說，如果並不把基本英語只當作與英語不可分離的，一種英語學習法，而企圖作爲可取英語而代之的合理化方法，「不能不說是完全失敗了」。而錢先生也承認它只是「在英語範圍内」的「捷徑」，並不作爲可以離英語而獨立的言語。所以這「完全失敗」，已「有事實可以證明」可無需「全國的學者」再來「代爲答覆」了。</p>
<p>㈢關於英語拼法合理化，錢先生除了「希望」我「自己去研究」美國人爲什麽怎麽樣之外，違背誦了一番「十六世紀」以來的歷史。在拼法合理化上，Anglic勝過基本英語，是不消說的。錢先生對於拼法合理化本身，不加深究，只說「無多大帮助」草草了事。我的答覆：錢先生，咱們先來談基本英語，Anglic呀，美國人爲什麽怎麽樣呀，咱們回頭再談吧！</p>
<p>㈣關於不規則動詞和名詞多數例外的合理化，錢先生是肯定的。「不過除了人造語以外，那一種活的言語是完全合理的呢。」我的答覆：作爲英語合理化方案的基本英語之失敗，就在於未能對既存的言語加以人工的意識的控制。但是要奥格登創出那樣的方案，是和要胡適博士去當義勇軍一樣不可能的。十幾年來中國的世界語反對論者，自「新靑年」時代的陶孟和先生，以至現在的張夢麟先生等，除了聽來的幾句「人造語」「死的東西」「生造的世界語」之</p>
<p>外，别無理論，眞是淺薄得可以。</p>
<p>㈤錢先生最後說：「難道我們學了一國的言語，便會成爲那國的臣民了嗎？」自然，學了英語，反膚變白頭髮發黃的事是不會有的，正和吃了牛肉不會變牛一樣明白。不過也要看「環境」。如果在「大拉斯」「金鎊」「皇軍的指揮刀」的威力之下，「環境」「不許」你不這樣的言語運動，實在是奴化植民地頂惡辣的武器。所以錢先生的這話，除了有意無意爲「滿洲國」强迫學日語作辯護之外，便没有什麽了。</p>
<h3>作家的理想人物（續）</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>沙寗的特色是什麽？第一，沙寗對於性慾有着超羣的驚人的論調：第二，他是極端地反對知識的；第三，他是有着極其健壯的體格，而這些點，都正是十九世紀八十年代的俄羅斯大部份智識階級所最苦惱着的關鍵。阿志巴綏夫，在他的作品中我們可以明白地看得出，他正是這樣苦惱着的知識階級的一份子。他的苦惱，丨丨對於自身或自己同皆級的人的苦惱，結果使他幻想出這位畸人沙寗，而更誇大地表現在藝術上。這種幻想正如那終生苦惱於長期肺病的英國作家斯蒂文生之過分地歌頌健康的心境是同樣的。</p>
<p>然而阿志巴綏夫在其理想人物的沙寗的表現上，並没有成功，因爲他是太缺少眞實性，幾乎不能使人相信那是有存在的可能的了。沙寗，以其對於性慾的超俗的解釋，而便作爲誘惑挑鬥美麗的女兒或甚至肉慾地擁抱自己的妹妹的理論的實證，這該是怎樣地卑鄙；以其對於知識的反感，丨五百頁的書上只有一瞬間提到他是在讀書，而便證實他的精神或談吐的健壯，這該是怎樣地羅曼蒂克；以其愚蠢的體力的顯示，而便製　出　個特　　　的對　人物來變他的一頓鞭打木遣護是怎樣地無　的英　　義；甚至那　許多人取爲美談的全　之結尾丨沙寗因爲在火車上厭惡人類的面孔而便勇敢地跳下火車來吐一口大氣的那塲景，又該是多麽狂誔吧。</p>
<p>總之沙寗是一個在幻想上被製作出來的人物，是緣於作者長久地苦惱於自身的缺欠而有意誇大地表現出他所認爲是理想的人物，而這人物是超乎一切實現的可能性之外了。這樣做作出來的東西，如是是經過了一番完整的精練的藝術的渲染，或者也可以成爲一個典型，作爲曾經實存的人物而欺騙了後世的讀者的吧（在文學的歷史的人物上是有着無數的這樣的實例的），但可惜阿志巴綏夫的藝術是未能作到這一步，在無論什麽地方，我們都可以看出他的有意的做作來。</p>
<p>由沙寗的例，對於我們的作者，可以供獻出一個敎訓，即一切作者之觀念的或狂想的人物，而想欺騙讀者們當作一種典型來接受，那是極少成功的可能性的。</p>

<h3>海濱之夜</h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>黑衣，她們三個人在軟鬆卷的沙子上走着。</p>
<p>各人懷着不同的心情，靜靜地向着海邊丨有燈光的海邊走着，風，並不大，可是吹在剛從熱得像　節一般的小屋子跑出來的她們身上，簡直有說不出的凉爽，舒暢。</p>
<p>一鈎新月剛從東邊的海底裏爬出來，光線是這麽淡，淡得使人看不出顏色來，要不是蕩漾在海水中的月影波光給她們看到的話。</p>
<p>漸漸地走到近海水的淺灘了，這是剛被潮水冲洗過的沙灘，更比剛才走過的要軟，要濕。風，一陣緊一陣地吹來，潮水打在石頭上撞擊沙灘的聲音，是這麽洪大而雄壯，這使得她們大呌起來了；</p>
<p>晨挺起胸膛，張開嗓子大聲呌着，珠凝視着海水不住地說；「太好了，太好了！」心，像小麻雀一般一面跳一面唱着Moon　night的歌曲。</p>
<p>她們是這樣快活，像判處了無期徒刑的囚犯忽然逃出獄來了一般，一切煩惱，悶熱，都消去了，只是毫無牽掛地投入了大自然的懷抱裡，她們誰也不管誰，只是踏着如綿般軟的細沙一步步前進。</p>
<p>整個的宇宙都浸在靜寂裡，如果没有風聲和海潮的聲盪聲，你簡直要懷疑你走進了死之國，而自己也變成了幽靈。</p>
<p>「不要走遠了吧，就在這里坐着看海，」不知是珠走得疲倦，還是没有胆量在黑暗中走路，她一個人站住了。（未完）</p>
<h3>女人（十四）</h3>
<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>那男孩子呢？他歡喜她。他在她面前時，又活潑，又年靑，離開她時，便諸事毫無意緒。他心亂了。他還不會向她說「他愛了她」，他并不淸楚什麽是愛。</p>
<p>她明白他是不會如何來說明那點心中煩亂的愛情的，她覺得這些方面美麗處，永遠在心上搆成一條五色的虹。</p>
<p>但兩人在凑巧中成了朋友，却仍然在另一凑巧中發生了點誤會，終於離開了。（一個極長的冬天。）</p>
<p>那年秋天他轉入了北京的Ｘ大學理科，她也到了北京入了ＸＸ敎會大學的文科二年級。</p>
<p>他們仍然見了面。她成了往日在南海之濱所見到的一個十七歲女孩子，非得到那個男孩子不成了。</p>
<p>她愛了他。他却因爲明白了她就是一個官僚的女子，且從一些不可爲據的傳聞上，得到這個女人一些故事，他便儘避著她。</p>
<p>年齡同時形成兩人間一重膈閡，女人却在意外情形中成爲一個失戀者，在各樣冷淡中她仍然保持到她那分眞誠。至於他呢，還只是一個二十一歲的孩子，氣概太强了點，太單純了點，只想在化學中將來能有一分成就，對於國家有所貢獻。這點單純處使他對於戀愛看得與平常男子不同了。事實上他還是個小孩子，有了信仰，就不要戀愛了。</p>
<p>如此在一堆無多精彩的連續而來的日子中，打發了將近一千個日子。兩人只在一分親切友誼裏很自重的過着下去。</p>
<p>到後却終於决裂了，女人既已畢了業，且在那個學校研究院過了一年，他也畢業了。她明白這件事應得有一個結果，她便結束了這件事，告給他，她已預備過法國去。那男的只是用三年來已成習慣的態度，對於她所說的話表示同意，他到後却告她，他只想到上海一家酸類工廠做助理技師，積了錢再出國讀書。</p>
<p>她告他只要他想讀書，她願意他把她當個好朋友，讓她借給他一筆錢。他就說他并不想這樣讀書，這種讀書毫無意思。</p>
<p>他們另外還說了别的，這驕傲美麗的男子，差不多全照上而語氣答復女子。</p>
<p>她到後便什麽話也不說，只預備走。</p>
<p>他恰好於這時節在實騐室中了毒。</p>
<p>後來入了醫院，成爲ＸＸ醫院病房中一位常住者，病房中病人床邊那張小椅子上，便常常坐了那個女子。</p>
<p>人在病中性情總温柔了些。</p>
<p>他們每天温習三年前那海上一切，這一片在各人印象中的海，顏色鮮明，但兩人相顧，却都不像從前那麽天眞了。這病對於女人給了許多機會，使女人的柔情，在各種小事上，該那個躺在白色被單裏的病人，明白牠，領會牠。</p>
<p>（春天，有雪徵融的春天。不，黃葉作證，這不是春天！）</p>

<h3>廣角越出九十元關</h3>
<p>近來廣東小洋市面、時有升降、良以供求時有殷懈之故、昨日又見緊張、故早市開價頓時重至七百九十元大關、午市竟越出關外、加昻八有、而爲七百九十元零八角、如是則較前日午市又漲三元之譜、做出交易早市十二萬五千角、午市九萬五千角、江南小洋、亦好一元、爲八百四十二元、早午同價、交易早市五千五百角、早市六千角、銅元放長五百文、爲三百十六千文、交易三萬七千九百二十串、計代價洋一萬二千元、</p>
<h3>證劵債市有續小可能</h3>
<p>丨九六整理已成泡影丨</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市面漸見活躍、自林康侯君有九六不整理之談話後、市塲人氣頓爲軟化、加以閩共猖獗、謠言愈熾、大户多頭漸有出籠、放空者亦復不少、交易亦驟見增加、上午開盤、各種行市尙屬平穩、大概均小去一角左右、惟九六因有不能整理之說、跌落四角、次盤散户頗有賣出、市面更形不始、續小二角左右、午後開盤、大户五號及三十號等頗有賣出、吃户漸弱、市價續小一角至四角、因市上謠傳閩亂愈烈、故多頭漸有出籠、情勢至爲不振、收盤因檯面空頭略有結進、市價似略好一二角、九六忽又傳有持票人復行要求整理之說、故又略行回好、市價結果、計跌落一角至五角左右不等、九六跌六角、依市塲人氣觀察、市價有續小之可能、但如有特殊原因、或可暫時回上、成交總數、計共一千零三十二萬一千元、内現貨一千元、期貨統盤稅共三百四十萬零五千元、裁兵佔一百十六兩、一九閩善共九十二萬五千、廿捲關關共一百九十九萬五千、九六佔二百零三萬、餘亦數萬至二三十萬不等、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗花未受美棉跌風影響</h3>
<p>紗市平定、漲跌互見、但形勢尙挺、因商場上傳說極盛、謂廠方有請求政府維持紗價之說、故有一部份吸收之包額頗巨、檯面較緊、美棉雖跌、而紗市尙能支持、同時實需銷化較前爲多、且時期尙在旺月之際、所以做多之念較强云、</p>
<h3>人標參差細微</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、隨外棉不佳而跌、詎二三盤突緊、買户較多、近跌一角、遠漲一二角、但空頭仍不抵補、午後聞現銷尙好、各月又漲二·四角、遠跌一角、全日成交統計一萬九千二百包、查賢出穗隆一千四百包、椿記七百包、仁豐七百五十包、益昶七百五十包、同興六百五十包、買進椿記一千二百包、大豐九百包、森康九百包、義餘九百五十包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>鄭標平定</h3>

<h3>美棉驟跌三四十磅音</h3>

<h3>糧食外行多頭爭購標粉</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈初軟繼穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌五六角、坎拿大跌一角左右、故開價時、人心見疲、本月份低至二角五分半、十月份至二角七分、惟二盤以後、因外行多頭、終以借麥未購之消息、人心依然堅定、故一軟之後、又復搶進、市價遂回起近分、迨至下午開盤、以麥市之疲而復俏、開價頗見激昻、較上午收價、計好一分零、惟二盤因廠家出檔、又見回軟、三盤以後、因廠家未出、外行仍有抬進、致市氣復趨高昻、至天津方面、聞日銷二三萬、價較前小一分、照此出銷之時、仍未見暢、未免爲前途重大之牽累也、結果本月份較前日好一分、十月份至一月份好一分半、二月份好一分二厘半、</p>
<h3>流言抬高麥價</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份雖見一度之軟檔、以洋麥報價回跌一角至五六角不等、故開價時本月份小至九角二分、十月份至三分、十一月份至一角一分、較前日計跌二三分不等、入後因浮空抵補、又見回振、迨至下午開盤、以一　人謠傳政府方面、將維持麥價、致多頭方面、又大事抬價、惟各盤實在賣買、並不甚暢、大部分均爲投機出入也、至借麥問題、聞正在醞釀之中、想不久當能顯露一部也、結果本月份較前日反好三分、十月份好四分、十一月份好四分、十二月份好三分、餘未動、現麥市面、略呈淸淡、高麥尙穩、中次平平、開榛潼麥三元九角二分、次八角八分、揚州麥三元七角、常州麥三元六角六分、六合麥三元六角六七分、漢口麥三元四角二分、計三千包、由信大辦去云、</p>
<h3>粉麥業中人之論調</h3>
<p>日昨報載中央各有關部會議有維持小麥法五項、雖未盡得其詳、本市人心爲之一振、麥價爲之推進、但據業中人就事實立言、以爲麥則早經購就、旁證國際電訊亦屬無疑、目下正謀如何出路、以及用何種市値分配於華商廠家耳、至於本年之粉銷疲滯、實非偶然、其大要則爲各地之經濟破產、最近天津積粉仍有三百萬包弱、本埠亦有三百萬、各廠存麥、至少尙有二月之用量、卽以此種數額及幾用來之實銷推測、已足敷半年之用、如果以各地之麥產統統包括在内、此後卽未定洋麥亦可敷衍至明年新麥時期、所心無論如何救濟、終未能脫離事實、而另謀出路、良以中國之不景氣、無殊國外之過剩、以金元國家尙難打破此種難關、我國果有上力量乎、</p>
<h3>河下米平疲局面</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三十餘號、零躉兩胃與前無異包胃共計二千餘包、市形平庸、常帮蘇同帮南港等粳、及杜羊尖、靑角松泗西練薄秈等行情均無軒輊、變元以胃呆垂軟、陰元仍屬平平、河下新粳及新杜洋尖因到貨稍湧、又以天氣關係、市價續疲角許、廠東新幸頗合店胃、仍開七元、（滬北）昨日河下各路來源二十三·四號、市上各貨去胃稍化、市形白粳高貨稍疲、中次定格、早稻陳羊杜平正、薄秈及新羊尖團尖價小近尺、陳客尖定立、新客尖略帶軟勢、變元又小尺外、</p>
<h3>泉州帮暢辦新客秈</h3>
<p>丨洋米浙銷停頓丨</p>
<p>昨日新客秈續有到申、尤以車貨由寗到下爲多、存底亦漸加厚、長江新客秈因成本較高、到貨不及京秈之擁、市面以存到兩多而看小、但昨日有泉州帮暢辦、成交新到之南京新機秈五千包、價六元三角六分至六元二角半、比前日漲二三分、價閩化活潑之故、湖南新糙靖米亦辦去四百八十八包、湘省今年收成極佳、湘省官商已經合作互助於推銷一途、此後可望逐次裝到、故人心甚軟、價早已步落二三角、昨經泉州暢辦、存糙掃數銷通、市面隨得站住、價開五元二角三分、次尖元一角四分、甬帮連日辦裝小絞甚多、昨胃已淡、祇辦江西機晚一百包、價七元三角六分、比前日售價相近、惟新早議價未妥、仍未開價、洋米由本街　應酬小絞三百包、價仍六元七角半云、</p>
<h3>新菉荳高貨漸少</h3>
<p>昨市新菉荳去胃稍活、來源少數有到、且高檔陳貨漸少、故身佳之新明菉有廣帮問題、其胃勢或可蟬聯、計成交四百餘包、爲蚌埠貨、價開五元三角半至五元、新毛菉市氣仍疲、來貨雖少、然銷化乏力、售開二百餘包、價爲四元、亦係蚌埠貨、續由厦門帮採進云、</p>
<h3>糖市國產高綿赤續漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市以關金略小、趨勢平疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白初市劃二十一元五角八、後爲五角半、比前日跌二分至五分、二十號中砂白高貨Ｐ嘜二十一元一角半、普通二十元八角、荷赤因前日信益有大批開出、市勢較疲、ＰＫ嘜呌十六元八角、尙未成盤、太古糖各小一角、Ｂ嘜二十一元八角、ＣＷ嘜二十一元七角、ＤＹ嘜二十一元三角半、ＨＸ嘜二十元九角、本廠綿白振記一號開二十元六角、二三四五號照退比前日小角半、潮靑開出百餘包、提莊靑升一角、爲十六元一角、次之十五元八角、高綿赤開出一百十餘包、價升十八元二角、</p>
<h3>南北貨新桂圓首盤已開</h3>
<p>首批新同安桂圓及新碼宏、前日均有少數裝到、置本均昻、昨已如數開出、計同安極魁開六十元、同安正宏四十元、正號新碼宏三十八·九元、副宏二十三·四元、以數少　沿屬穩俏云、</p>
<h3>絲茶蘇屬秋繭質次價小</h3>
<p>武進秋繭扯三十元　武進四鄉秋繭、以東鄉早蠶、收成最豐、北鄉晚蠶繭產較次、繭行已開秤三四日、繭價東鄉最高三十三四元、西北鄉最低二十五·六元、平均約扯三十元、</p>
<p>蘇屬秋繭標準價　浙屬秋繭、身骨較優、鮮繭標準、價由蘇浙繭業統制委員會議定、爲四十元、蘇屬繭汛較晏、因受天時影響、繭產稍次、折頭較大、鮮繭標準價現已講定、看高三十五元、</p>
<p>人造絲滙長價疲　外滙放長、人造絲扯價平疲、客銷稍起、昨由長江帮進矮克發本色金麒麟、紅金鐘等牌本月份現期貨四十六箱、價自一百八十元至一百六十五元二角半凈擊、較前回小二角半、</p>
<p>歐美絲銷無生氣　紐約市鄉、因橫濱日絲價跌、廠銷益無生氣、英倫敦絲開價奇小、里昻絲電仍不見轉、滬埠歐美各駐因手中揑貨無人閱訊、對於期現絲益無進胃、華絲商則以絲廠工潮復起、態度消極、市氣停滯、昨祇印莊進黃絲經十八包、價仍平疲、</p>
<h3>洋莊茶市轉淸</h3>
<p>各歐莊以前數日辦進之鉅額珍眉·蝦目各種綠茶、亟須整理裝運出口、故對於市上各茶暫行停辦、全市僅由華茶、恊和等行買進珍眉·針眉等綠茶九百餘箱、售價無變動、此外祁門紅茶、同孚洋行略有進胃、售盤亦無上落云、</p>
<h3>五金水泥鋼鐵實交發動</h3>

<h3>白菓的功效與用法</h3>
<p>火夏已逝，凉秋乍臨。街頭巷尾，瀰漫着一片呌聲，洋洋盈耳：「燙手熱白菓，香是香來糯又糯，」這是小販們呌賣所謂「熱白菓，」在上海是一種極普遍</p>
<p>的應時點綴。</p>
<p>白菓是銀杏樹所結果實的核子。銀杏，一名公孫檯，落葉喬木，高五六丈，葉薄，形如扇；有缺刻；春日開小花，色白，略帶淡綠。初秋結實，去肉取核，就是白菓。</p>
<p>白菓的命名，是就其本體形色而言。果仁當鮮嫩的時候，明瑩鮮綠；時日一多，就帶黃色。形椭圓，二頭尖小，略如橄欖，但有稜紋，二稜或三稜不等。照此標準的，名呌「佛手菓」，是上品；也有形體渾圓，好似櫻桃樣的，稱做「梅菓」比較的次下了。</p>
<p>白菓性甘苦，平濇無毒。熟吃有温肺益氣的功効。照本草綱目上有好幾則應用的方法，摘錄一二如下：（一）面部酒皶，手足鈹裂，生白菓嚼爛，以汁塗敷。㈡小便頻數，白菓十四枚，七生七煨同吃。㈢白濁，生白菓十枚，研細，和温水呑吃，每天一次，很有効騐。㈣乳癖潰爛，白菓半斤四兩研細和酒服；四兩</p>
<p>研細敷塗有効。</p>

<h3>「窮」與「偷和搶」的另一意識</h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>丨讀了因先生的「偷」和「搶」而作丨「偷和搶」並非是「人」的「本能」，而［窮」，確能夠「燃燒出熱烈的向上的動的情緒」，這在中華民國二十二年八月三十一日的本刋的因先生的『「偷」和「搶」』的一文裏，已經說得非常透澈而且詳盡了。最後並且提出强有力的「世界革命文豪高爾基」來作爲硬證。這在我，本來可以「默爾而息」的。所以没有「默爾而息」的緣故，是尙感覺到有幾個「異點」：而其目的，是希望可以得到更多同時是更徹底而明瞭的結論。所以此文之作，决不是有意的攻訐或者是無謂的辯駁。</p>
<p>「自殺」是「弱者」的行爲，我絕對的「不否認」：而我却不能像因先生那樣的「鄙薄」，因爲我認爲這是社會畸形發展的必然的結果：同時也是「窮」的「解脫」的無可奈何的「悲慘」的出路丨所以我之對於這許多的犧牲者，祇有同情，歎惜，而竭力的想法予以救濟丨予以積極的救濟。使這種「悲慘」的現象可以减少「自殺」的原因十有八九是因爲「窮」，而「窮」在現在差不多已成了「普遍的毛病」！在因先生的意思是「窮人」必須要「吃得苦」，經過了「窮」的階段才能有「永久的偉大的眞實的創造」，在我們的古諺裏似乎也有這樣兩句：「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人」。然而事實在告訴我們，有許多人守分安貧地吃了一輩子的「苦」還是做不到「人上人」的！所以，不禁引起了我對於「窮」的懷疑。現在我更懷疑到「在窮的波濤中打了千萬以至無數滾而最後成功」的「世界革命文豪高爾基」的成功是千百萬「窮人」中的僥倖的一員？</p>
<p>至於「搶」和「偷」，我的心目的的却並不像「因」先生所說的那樣狹義。因爲如果眞的因了「窮」而去做了賊或强盜去「偷」或「搶」，那麽，非特没有「溫飽享樂的希望」。並且因了這是犯「法」行爲的緣故，還有「拘役」「監禁」甚而至於「槍斃」的危險。這就是「窮鈎」的行爲而應當「誅」的了。</p>
<p>我的所謂「偷」和「搶」，其實便是「因」先生所說的奮鬥的進取的實際的創造的原則。「偷」的是人家的方法，如日本人的善於模念仿一樣····「搶」的是人家的利益，如資本主義國家掠奪弱小民族的所有一樣。這樣的「偷」和「搶」，便再大些也不妨，因爲唯有廣義的有計劃的「偷」和「搶」，才是「熊熊的爐火」，才能「燃燒出熱烈的向上的動的情緒」，才能進一步而成「永久的偉大的眞實的創造」，才是「窮人」的眞眞出路。所以我確信「偷」和「搶」是「人」的「本能」</p>
<h3>秋帶來了悲哀</h3>
<p>— 煒仁</p>
<p>八月三十日的一個秋的晚上，月亮半圓的正從東面的葡萄棚上慢慢的爬起來。殺殺的梧桐葉被風不時的打着，向地下飄落着，而從牆脚邊的草堆裏，秋虫發狂似的唱着悲壯的戰歌。而在薄薄的一層枯黃又略帶紅色的桐葉上面，被月光反映出的舖着二個緊密細長的人影；同時在淸靜的空氣中從葡萄棚裏面飛揚出微弱的細密的談話。</p>
<p>「玲姊，我明天一定走了，不得不離開她要走了！但是······」我背了她的臉　很傷感的幾乎流出熱淚來對她說着。</p>
<p>「惠弟，别離也許是件最苦惱的事件，但是爲着你的一切起見，你還是走吧！我想信世界不至於會像你所想像般的殘酷，在任何地方你都可找到安慰的人，又何况你的使命，是要呌你去接近世界上一切的人們呢！」她像慈母般的扳過我的頭去慈和的說着。</p>
<p>她的慈和與威嚴更使我想信她的崇高偉大。我們在這皎潔的月光下，細細的傾心談着。談着我們的過去，現在和將來。當我想到未來的没有一定目的飄泊起悵惘。我說；</p>
<p>「玲姊，我將怎樣的去衙我所不曾生活過的環璄奮鬥呢？」</p>
<p>「惠弟，你又爲何要這樣的擔心呢？你將知道，你的畢生的責任是多麽的重大啊！那麽我們的暫别又能算爲什麽一件事呢！」</p>
<p>「······」</p>
<p>「什麽，在流淚？這是閑手没有事可做的娘　們做的把戲啊！别再傻了，把你的頭擡起來，放出些勇敢的精神，惠弟！」我們談羊，細細的談着，直到秋的夜風帶來了寒意。</p>
<p>這便是去年的一個别離的秋夜。但是時間是走的多快！在Ｓ省飄流</p>

The situation is extremely dangerous. A telegram has been sent to Sichuan requesting reinforcements; otherwise, they will be forced to retreat to Garzê, it is said. Furthermore, Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province, sent an urgent telegram to Nanjing yesterday, reporting that Zhongdian in Northwest Yunnan has been occupied by foreign troops.

<h3>Change of Public Security Bureau Chief in Qingdao; Han Telegrams Central Government Questioning</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Because the chief of the Qingdao Public Security Bureau was changed, Han Fuqu, without Shen Honglie knowing in advance, today telegrammed Lin, Chiang, and Wang, stating that Qingdao and Shandong adjoin, and the relationship is extremely important. Since the Central Government entrusted Qingdao to Shen, he should have the authority to employ people and administer. If he cannot participate in the promotion or dismissal of his direct subordinates, it seems to deviate from the intention of the state to establish officials, especially creating opportunities for outsiders to misunderstand. Fuqu suddenly heard of this matter and was half-believing and half-doubting, pacing around the room in unease, unable to sleep or eat well. He dares to beseech your excellency to consider that Qingdao is an extremely important place for the country, and Mayor Shen is a reliable and trusted person.

<h3>Xu Xinwu and Others Arrive in Jinan to Discuss Flood Barrier Project</h3>
<p>Mei Yilin Goes to Western Shandong to Inspect River Works</p>
<p>(Jinan) Xu Xinwu and engineers Wang Fengxi and Lu Keming arrived in Jinan to meet with Han and discuss the flood barrier. Xu said that the Yellow River management work includes: (A) The flood barrier project, of which Hebei bears the greatest burden and the greatest harm affects Shandong; (B) Repairing the dikes. The section near the East Dam of Lanfeng and the west side of the Pinghan Railway Bridge is the most critical. If the East Dam is not repaired, a breach will turn Western Shandong and Northern Jiangsu into a swamp. If the section west of the Pinghan Bridge breaches, the Xiangwei River may flow from Hebei into the sea, causing great harm to North China. Both are matters of national concern, not just a portion. There are still many other dangerous works that should be repaired. (C) Raising and thickening the dikes along the entire river. This committee is only planning whether it can be implemented, depending on the central government's financial resources. Before leaving, I met with Wang, who said that 500,000 yuan would be allocated first to deal with the first step of the flood barrier project, with subsequent allocations later. The first zone is Henan, with engineer Cai Lianggong; the second zone is Hebei, with engineer Wang Fengxi; the third zone is Shandong, with engineer Lu Keming. But it is not strictly divided, and cooperation will occur when needed. The Yellow River Committee and the provincial governments will also cooperate as a principle. The breaches are in Zhengzhou, Lanfeng, Kaocheng, and Wenxian in Henan, and Erfenzhuang and Shitouzhuan in Hebei, of which Shitouzhuan has as many as 32 breaches. (6th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Embassy Female Secretary Assaulted by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Intervention by the French Military Attache Ends It</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ms. Agelow, the personal secretary of American Minister to China Johnson, was riding a horse around the area of Jiaomin Lane yesterday when she was savagely attacked by armed soldiers of the Japanese Embassy guard. All foreign circles in Beiping are very resentful about this matter. The Japanese military did not notify other embassies in advance, nor did they post signs along the road. Suddenly, during exercises, they forbade riders from passing through the sections they occupied, only giving riders unnamed notes written in pencil. Ms. Agelow disregarded it and continued forward. Upon her return, more than ten Japanese soldiers surrounded her with bayonets fixed. One of them threw a large rock at Ms. Agelow's horse, and others struck Ms. Agelow's arm and broke her riding crop. Several soldiers even grabbed the horse's reins and tried to forcibly take Ms. Agelow away. Later, the commander of the French Embassy guard witnessed this and intervened, preventing her from further suffering violence. (5th Day North China Daily News Telegram)</p>

<h3>Use of Dutch庚子 Indemnity Funds</h3>
<p>A portion to be used for water conservancy, a portion for scholarships.</p>
<p>Singapore: According to Mr. Song Faxiang, Consul-General stationed in Batavia, Dutch庚子 Indemnity funds will be allocated to subsidize Chinese students who graduate from Dutch schools in Java and Sumatra. Chinese students who have already graduated in Java will be sent back to China to specialize in Chinese language studies. Then, the government will send them to various universities in the Netherlands at public expense. This project has been approved by the Dutch government. The Dutch庚子 Indemnity will be fully returned to China starting in 1926. Sixty-five percent of these funds will be used to manage the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, to reduce the risk of flooding from the two rivers. The remaining thirty-five percent will be designated as scholarships for sending Chinese students to the Netherlands. To provide Javanese Chinese students with scholarship opportunities, the Netherlands will revise the curriculum of Chinese schools, as Chinese schools only focus on English and Chinese. Mr. Song intends to suggest that Chinese students at the Batavia Medical College and the Padang Institute of Technology should have the opportunity to obtain scholarships. However, those going to the Netherlands must study Chinese for at least two years. (Reuter's dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for Rejection by the Central Political Council of the Customs' Request for Additional Budget</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Customs has recently suffered losses of over 600,000 taels per month due to the impact of gold prices. The Ministry of Finance submitted a request for an additional budget, which was rejected by the Central Political Council on August 23. The reasons given were: Since there are times when gold and silver exchange rates are lower than income, there should also be times when they are higher. With multiple exchanges, the highs and lows should offset each other. Even if the result is a profit or loss, it should not be excessively loss-making. The total number of gold units sold this year is 52 million, and the exchange loss between China and the United States has reached more than 3 million. For two months, the losses have almost exceeded the profits. If there is any dishonesty or incompleteness in the process, it would be tantamount to willingly accepting exploitation and deception from financial institutions, and the blame for poor management would be unavoidable. The national treasury can hardly bear such improper losses. Moreover, after the budget is announced, the restrictions on submitting additional requests are extremely strict. It is only stipulated that additional requests can be made when there are unavoidable situations under the law or contract where there is a shortfall. The conditions of this case do not meet these criteria. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>The Self-Awareness of Responsibility in Naval Circles</h3>
<p>Since Xie Gangzhe took office as commander of the Third Fleet of the Navy, he has moved the headquarters and training team to Weihaiwei. Although other affiliated units still remain in Qingdao, they are also ordered to move outside the city. According to Xie, the motivation for this move is, first, to avoid the suspicion of interfering in politics, and second, to get rid of the atmosphere of extravagance. Well said! How pleasant it is to hear! Military arrogance has been around for a long time. Indolence has become a habit, and it is difficult to change. The reason why the country has declined to this point is that these people should bear the majority of the responsibility. We are extremely heartbroken, but we have never made a clear indication. How fortunate it is that Xie has issued this edict, and how fortunate it is to hear the words of self-awareness of responsibility from the mouth of a military leader!</p>
<p>Originally, it is the duty of soldiers to defend the country, and they should not engage in political activities. It is the urgent task of soldiers to forge their skills, and how can they allow themselves to be contaminated with decadent habits? However, today, many soldiers in our country regard military service as a special class, and rely on it as a shortcut to advancement. They have no thought of defending the country in their hearts, let alone the intention of striving for strength. From superiors to soldiers, almost all harbor a leisurely goal, and seek to achieve it deviously. Because they take enjoyment as their purpose, they try every means to interfere in politics to help their development. Also, because they have gained the opportunity to interfere in politics, they further increase their desire for extravagance. Such mutual causation and mutual push will make it impossible to prevent the corruption of military discipline.</p>
<p>The impact of military interference in politics often unsettles the political world and adds many unnecessary disturbances. The result of military enjoyment must reduce the ambition to fight and lose the cultivation of skills. This is a particularly common phenomenon in our naval circles. The navy is merely a formality, with few achievements, and often engages in instigating chaos and aiding disasters during turbulent political situations. We have already presented our accusations in the past. Recently, the test firing of a warship in Chu actually resulted in the rebound of a shell. Even after a new repair, with full preparation, in a public test, and under careful supervision, there was still this unexpected accident. Then, how is the usual combat exercise? How is the cultivation of skills? It is unimaginable. Supervisory Committee member Gao Youtang said that the navy has no reputation to speak of. Even we feel that his words are too harsh. Can the officers and soldiers of the navy endure this with shame forever? Or will they be determined to work hard and try to wash away this disgrace?</p>
<p>To wash away disgrace does not lie in retorting, but in self-reflection without guilt. The way to wash away disgrace cannot be borrowed from empty words as a tool for concealment, but must be based on facts as the final proof. For example, Navy Commander Chen Shaokuan said that the rebounding of shells is not surprising. This kind of excuse is not what we like to hear. It is necessary for Xie Gangzhe to have a self-aware expression before we can expect it. Since Xie has already spoken out first, he should be able to restrain himself afterwards. We hope that Xie will, from now on, sharpen his mind and strength, calmly go to the opportunity, and thoroughly clarify his true self-awareness of responsibility. We also hope that all the officers and soldiers of the navy will, under this encouragement and urging, understand that it is not convenient to hold a position without doing any work for a long time, and that it is no longer possible to steal a moment of peace. They should beat their chests and pull out their hair, and rise up together to jointly seek the self-awareness of responsibility of the entire navy. Then, the destruction of seeking perfection can be avoided, and unexpected praise can be achieved. We express our infinite hope for the development of a new atmosphere in the navy.</p>

<p>Havana: While the newly appointed Cuban President Cespedes was out of the capital investigating the wind disaster, Sergeant Batista of the army, in conjunction with a university professor and a radical journalist, ousted Cespedes and organized what they called a "Genuine Revolutionary Government." Batista claimed that the army and navy supported him, and stated that his purpose was to purge the officers who supported former President Machado and to revive Cuba according to the latest concept of democracy. Gunfire has been frequent in the city today, but all shots have been fired into the air and no casualties have been reported. Batista immediately announced that he was prepared to hand over power to a legally elected congress, and that Cuba's treaty obligations would be respected. An orderly demonstration is currently taking place in the streets, and troops are patrolling the streets to prevent accidents. President Cespedes rushed back to the capital upon hearing the news, but the Minister of Interior has announced that he and the former cabinet members are prepared to cooperate with the new government. (Reuter's Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Beginning of the Revolution</h3>
<p>According to reports, when yesterday's incident first began, it was nothing more than a military mutiny. Officers who clung to former President Machado were expelled and detained. Staff Sergeant Gang Chailai was publicly elected as Chief of Staff. Gang esteemed Staff Sergeant Batista as superior to him. Therefore, these two staff sergeants became the commanders of the entire army and formed a temporary dictatorship. The police also joined the revolution.</p>
<h3>Formation of the Government</h3>
<p>Later, the radical opposition party, which claimed to be liberal, and the military that began to transform the mutiny into a political revolution. Gang and Ba knew that they had no political experience, so they followed their advice and organized a revolutionary committee with five members, electing Professor Grau as the leader, and Lieutenant Delatour as the capable person and spokesperson.</p>
<h3>Forcing the President to Leave</h3>
<p>After the Revolutionary Committee was established, it immediately demanded that President Cespedes reform politics. The President agreed. Then, they demanded that the cabinet resign. When the cabinet resigned en masse, they were still dissatisfied. A few hours later, they requested that the President cede his position. Cespedes left the Presidential Palace immediately, but stated that he had not yet resigned because there was no suitable authority to accept his resignation. Thus, the Revolutionary Committee moved into the Presidential Palace to work.</p>
<h3>Organization of the Five-Member Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Havana: The Cuban Revolutionary Committee has recently appointed five executive committee members: ㈠ Dr. Samartan, ㈡ Dr. Portela, ㈢ Dr. Irizali, ㈣ Carbo, ㈤ Franga. Army Sergeant Batista, originally from Chile and later naturalized as a Cuban, who advocated for the revolution, is now being promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Some parties have expressed concern about the organization of the executive committee, with some people leaning towards extremism, especially Carbo, who is a writer who has lived in the Soviet Union for two years. The five executive committee members mentioned above have equal power, and Portela only nominally holds the position of Executive Chairman. The current head of the National Police Department has been dismissed and replaced by Sergeant Laurent. The position of Chief of Staff of the Navy has also been assumed by another sergeant. (Havas Agency Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Issuance of Public Announcements</h3>
<p>After the committee forced the president to leave, it issued several public announcements to declare its plans and policies. One stated that it would respect national debts, especially foreign debts. Another denied any intention to greatly change the government system, saying it would organize a provisional government, convene a constitutional conference, and amend the constitution. A third announced that several officers who had been clinging to Machado had been dismissed after military trials, but denied reports of officers being shot in Havana. According to Lieutenant Delatour, the spokesperson for the committee, the Cespedes government could not represent the people and should be greatly reformed. The public announcement also stated that the committee did not want to hold power for long, and would resign as soon as the constitutional currency, economy, and military reforms were guaranteed. Delatour also stated that there was absolutely no resentment towards the arrival of American warships here.</p>
<h3>Party Support</h3>
<p>Havana: The ABC party, which was in a leading position when the Machado government was overthrown, announced today after a lengthy meeting that it would maintain a neutral position towards the new government. This declaration is expected to benefit the new government and greatly increase its chances of establishing a solid foundation. (National News Agency Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Denial of Leaning to the Left</h3>
<p>Professor Grau is a professor at San Martin University and a famous revolutionary figure, but his attitude is more appropriately described as liberal than radical. So far, there is no communist color among the revolutionary leaders. Grau also stated that he would not allow such radical figures to participate in the new revolution. However, there are some parties who are quite apprehensive about the deterioration of the situation, or leading to the participation of communists.</p>
<h3>Batista's Brief History</h3>
<p>Havana: The experience of Sergeant Batista, the leader of the army and navy rebellion in Cuba, is roughly as follows: Before joining the army, Batista was a stenographer who served in the judicial system, achieving the best results. For the past eight years, he has been responsible for the records of military courts. Taking this opportunity, he became acquainted with a majority of university students and figures of the Machado opposition party. It is rumored outside that this rebellion was due to the government's plan to cut military pay, but Batista denied this. It is also said that Batista personally has a relationship with the Machado faction, which he also denied. Former Army Chief Herrera declared that he did not know such a person. Batista said that the soldiers and junior officers who seized command this time are prepared to return to their original ranks as soon as the government is organized, and will still obey officers who have not harmed the people. Batista also said that there is absolutely no communist movement in the army and navy, and he would never tolerate it if there was one. (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Business as Usual</h3>
<p>The capital is currently as peaceful as usual. The people regard the revolution as no different from an election. The armies of the outer provinces have not yet expressed opposition to the revolutionary leaders here. However, the situation is still uncertain, because there seems to be a lack of central power to guarantee order. The Revolutionary Committee has only gained the support of several sergeants who claim to represent the army and navy. President Cespedes has not formally resigned, and his cabinet members are actually standing aside and doing nothing.</p>
<h3>Shooting of Officers</h3>
<p>There has been news that several military leaders who held military power during the Machado era have been shot in the camps. It is also heard that the authorities have drafted a list of those who should be shot, with quite a number of people listed. Four officers were also shot by soldiers in the Santiago area.</p>
<h3>Anti-American Actions</h3>
<p>It is also heard that radical elements have asked the committee to eliminate American influence. According to a gentleman from the American Legion, this news is quite certain, and the lives of American nationals are in danger. He and another veteran walked all over Havana tonight to notify American and other foreign nationals that if they saw any signs of anti-foreign riots, they should immediately take refuge in the National Hotel. The veterans will cooperate with the US Marines to take responsibility for protection.</p>
<h3>US Sends Warships</h3>
<p>The US destroyer McFarland has arrived here from Key West. Four more are on the way. Although US Ambassador Wells has indirectly warned all factions that if a civil war occurs, it will inevitably lead to intervention, he still represents US Secretary of State Hull in declaring that this dispatch of warships has no intention of interfering, but is only to protect the lives of American nationals. Seeing this situation, the leaders of the various factions have rushed to the US Embassy to guarantee that there will be no bloodshed.</p>
<h3>Intervention Threat</h3>
<p>US Ambassador Wells is currently busy consulting with the revolutionary leaders on everything and reporting the situation to Washington. Although he has not openly threatened to intervene, he has indirectly warned the Revolutionary Committee and Lieutenant Delatour that if an open rebellion occurs, the US Marines will land immediately. However, the embassy has stated that whether or not it intervenes, it will not endanger Cuba's independence. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull and Mr. Reiff, the State Department's specialist in Latin American affairs (who will succeed Welles as Ambassador to Cuba), visited President Roosevelt to discuss the Cuban situation for a long time. They also discussed the possibility of American intervention. After the meeting, a public announcement was made stating that in addition to the several warships already sent to Cuba, more will be sent to park in the vicinity of Cuban waters. Looking at the current situation, if a civil war breaks out in Cuba, the United States will definitely act quickly, but senior State Department officials say that there has been no decision on this matter, and they do not approve of any action by the United States. President Roosevelt said that the United States had not interfered and was able to make Machado resign, and its prestige could be said to be very strong. He does not want to lose this hard-earned prestige, but some people speculate that the United States may be in a situation where it cannot help but intervene. In addition, the acting president of Cuba, Cespedes, is only sheltering in a private residence, and has not actually formally resigned. The newly appointed US Ambassador to Cuba, Mr. Caffery, declared, "Our country certainly has the power to intervene according to the Platt Amendment, but the United States is extremely averse to actually exercising this power." He also said that what the United States government values most is maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries in international affairs. (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Japan Plans Countermeasures for the Next Washington Conference</h3>
<p>Three Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy Form Committee</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Britain and the United States intend to take advantage of the Second Washington Naval Disarmament Conference in 1935 to restrain Japan's power in the Pacific. On the Japanese side, the effect of withdrawing from the League of Nations will also occur at the same time as the Washington Conference in 1935, and Japan's international position will be extremely unfavorable. Encountering a truly major situation, it is necessary for the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy, as well as the General Staff Headquarters and the Naval General Staff Department, to have full and close communication. It has been decided to organize a permanent liaison committee within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the first meeting will be held at noon on the 7th. (Den Tsū Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Draft Investigation Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>Exerting the Skills of Economic Diplomacy, Specialized Investigation of Reddening of China and Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo News: The draft of the Investigation Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was suspended due to the incompatibility between the original plan during Yoshizawa's tenure and the nature of the diplomatic policy decision-making body like the Diplomatic Investigation Council advocated by the Privy Council. Afterwards, several new plans were drafted, and negotiations were conducted with the Privy Council. Recently, Vice Minister Shigemitsu visited each advisor of the Privy Council and obtained their understanding. As a result, the final draft of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was prepared, and the Director General of the Legislation Bureau, Kurosaki, requested the Privy Council Examination Committee to review it. The contents of the final draft of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which will be discussed in September, are as follows: ㈠ An investigation department will be established within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to participate in the investigation and planning of various diplomatic affairs. It is necessary to ensure that the department only has the nature of an administrative bureau and has no diplomatic decision-making power. ㈡ The head of the department will be a Choku-nin official. ㈢ The department will be divided into five sections: the first section will investigate the diplomatic situation in Asia, the second section will investigate the diplomatic situation in Europe and the United States, the third section will specifically investigate the reddening propaganda of China, Manchuria, and Japan, the fourth section will investigate the trade and economic situation of various countries, and the fifth section will be responsible for liaison with other sections and accounting affairs. The special establishment of a section for investigating reddening propaganda is due to considering the ideological problems within Japan, the activities of the Chinese Communist Party, the Russian propaganda along the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the active progress of Soviet Russia in Xinjiang Province, China. The section was established after considering the opinions of the Privy Council, to exert the skills of trade investigation and economic diplomacy. The Trade Deliberation Council, which is scheduled to be held in September, will only meet for one or two days, but the council has a permanent nature and will be held at any time when necessary in the future. The Investigation Department has an administrative nature, while the council has the nature of an advisory council. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Military Decides to Reform Military System</h3>
<p>Adopting the Latest Weaponry to Increase Combat Power, Transferring Five Divisions to the Korean-Manchurian Border to Prepare for Russia</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry has decided to reform the military system starting next spring. According to the Japanese military, the proposal for military system reform was delayed due to the busy response to the September 18th Incident, which prevented internal reforms. Now that the Manchurian incident has come to an end, they can focus all their efforts on internal reforms. The main points of the proposed reform plan are as follows: 1) Five standing army divisions will be transferred to the Manchurian and Korean borders with Russia to counter the Soviet Union. This requires revising matters related to the garrison locations, troop strength, and organization of the standing army in the country. 2) Each army will be equipped with various new types of military machinery and ammunition, emphasizing scientific roles and supplementing combat power.

<h3>Japan's Latent Crisis</h3>
<p>Facing Internal and External Difficulties, Industrial Recovery Ultimately Becomes a Fantasy</p>
<p>| Commentary from Russian Newspaper |</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" published an editorial analyzing Japan's domestic situation. The newspaper, in commenting on the recent cabinet reshuffle movement in Japan, pointed out that the essence of Prime Minister Saito's political strategy is to paralyze the efforts of the Seiyukai to undermine the cabinet. After detailing the economic situation in Japan, the newspaper concluded that the economic panic continues to deepen and intensify, while the so-called industrial recovery is merely a fantasy. The current financial situation constitutes the most serious problem for Japanese capitalists, and the most difficult problem is how to find funds to continue their insane arms expansion. In addition to these problems, the increasingly complex and tense international situation further exacerbates the situation. Thus, Japanese imperialism is facing the greatest difficulties, while the domestic political situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the people's dissatisfaction is growing daily. Even the panic of the police has failed to curb the growth of "dangerous thoughts." "Izvestia" concludes that this situation has promoted the attempt of various opposing political parties belonging to the same class to unite and cooperate. (Fifth Day TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Receives Representatives of the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Seeking Understanding Through Compromise with Political Parties</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Saito Makoto received representatives of various factions of the House of Peers at 4:00 PM today. More than forty people attended. Speaker Konoe did not attend due to illness. Saito explained the meeting with the presidents of the three parties in the House of Representatives and requested spiritual assistance from the various factions in the House of Peers. Duke Ichijo questioned the Prime Minister, saying that after the public trial of the May 15th Incident, the people's resentment towards political parties has deepened. Is the government compromising with political parties? Saito replied that the government is only seeking spiritual assistance from the various factions in the House of Representatives and has not coordinated national policies, so there is no question of compromise or non-compromise. Due to the serious domestic and foreign situation, he requested that the spirit of both houses be united to support the government and overcome this crisis.

<p>(Tokyo) On the sixth day, it was rumored that Britain, citing the existence of the Anglo-Dutch cotton industry agreement, intends to request Japan to recognize the Netherlands' participation in the Anglo-Japanese trade conference. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry expressed its opposition to this claim for the following reasons: Although an agreement has been established between Britain and Japan, if Japanese goods are imported into Britain through the Netherlands, the purpose of the agreement cannot be achieved. Therefore, it advocates the participation of the Netherlands in the conference. However, the Japanese authorities' policy for the Anglo-Japanese and Japanese-Indian conferences is based on the principle of not discussing the market issues of third countries. If the British side proposes this issue, the Japanese government and people will definitely reject it. (Sixth Day Japanese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Dutch-Japanese Arbitration Treaty was formally signed by Minister Saito and the Dutch Foreign Minister in The Hague on April 19th. The Foreign Ministry has received the full text of the treaty and will consult the Privy Council within days. Internal negotiations have begun. The purpose of this treaty is to resolve all issues between the Netherlands and Japan through mediation or arbitration and to promote friendly relations. However, recently, the Netherlands has been planning to form an economic group between itself and the Dutch East Indies, or to withdraw from various treaties that hinder import restrictions and tariff increases. Therefore, it previously declared its withdrawal from the tariff truce agreement and further expressed its intention to withdraw from the export and import restriction abolition agreement. Therefore, the trend of the Japanese-Dutch treaty at this time is particularly noteworthy. (Sixth Day Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Dawes, Entrusted with the Mission of Mediating Disarmament, Arrives in London</h3>
<p>Britain and France to Hold Preparatory Meeting in Paris to Establish a Basis for Detailed Discussion in the Future</p>
<p>(London) Dawes, the American representative attending the Disarmament Conference, arrived in Plaidy today and will stay in London for ten days before heading to Geneva via Paris. He will likely participate in the preparatory meeting on the British disarmament draft to be held by British and French diplomatic officials in Paris on September 18th, which will establish the basis for detailed discussion in the future. Dawes told a Reuters reporter today that the United States has not changed its attitude towards disarmament and feels the importance of the success of the Disarmament Conference even more. (Fifth Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Norman Dawes, the American representative to the Disarmament Conference, recently stated that "the United States would be pleased if European countries could conclude mutual non-aggression treaties." He also said that he supports the British disarmament plan, but its details should be carefully studied. Dawes will stay in Britain for ten days before heading to France. (Sixth Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Disarmament Conference was originally scheduled to be held in Geneva on October 10th. However, the naval competition between Britain and the United States is intensifying, and the world situation tends to oppose disarmament. All countries also know that under such circumstances, even if disarmament is discussed, it will be ineffective. Therefore, some advocate postponing the Disarmament Conference. Chairman MacDonald is quite worried about this and plans to visit various European countries in September to persuade them to hold the meeting as scheduled. However, it is doubtful to what extent he can prevent this situation. Moreover, the security guarantee plan proposed by Prime Minister MacDonald has encountered difficulties because the attitude of the United States has changed. Germany also believes that if the issue of military supervision cannot be resolved and Germany lacks sincerity, it cannot be implemented. Therefore, the future of the conference is quite bleak.

<h3>British Cabinet Meets All Day to Consider Disarmament Issues</h3>
<p>(London) British cabinet ministers rushed back to London from various rural areas to attend today's cabinet meeting. The attendance was large, and the meeting lasted a long time, adjourning only in the evening. Prime Minister MacDonald went to Balmoral Castle in Scotland to report the progress of the meeting to the King. It is now believed that the most important issues discussed at the meeting were the situation in Europe, with particular emphasis on the recent developments in the Disarmament Conference. Although the results of Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson's tour of the continent were unfavorable, British cabinet members still hope that the Disarmament Conference can continue. It is now generally believed that the reconvening of the Disarmament Conference should await developments in the government situation after Hitler comes to power in Germany and a clear resolution of the Austrian issue.

<h3>American Recovery Movement</h3>
<p>President Asks Banks to Freely Extend Loans and Grant Grace Periods, Invites Ford to Join Industry Regulations</p>
<p>Havas, Chicago, Fifth Day -- President Roosevelt issued a letter to bankers, urging them to extend loans to industry and commerce as much as possible so that the National Economic Recovery Plan can succeed, saying, "The country needs courageous bankers, and there is no greater urgency than today."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, Sixth Day -- President Roosevelt asked the American Bankers Association to release credit loans so that industries can cope with the increased costs under its new industry regulations. This move has caused consternation. Association President Sisson claimed today that the authorities do not blame themselves for their failures but want to blame the banks.

<h3>Austria Increases Border Defense Strength</h3>
<p>Rumors of the Current Prime Minister's Retirement</p>

<p>National, London, Sixth Day -- The Daily Telegraph's foreign affairs reporter predicted today that Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss will resign soon. The doctor is very tired of the deepening opinions of the cabinet members and is exhausted from fighting against the growing National Socialist Party movement. Therefore, he decided to retire to make way for capable people. Moreover, the doctor deeply felt that if the people's trust in the government is not firm, then even if foreign financial and spiritual assistance is obtained, it would be useless. The newspaper also criticized the Austrian government's dispatch of several police aircraft to the German-Austrian border, saying that the Austrian government's excuse that the machines were privately rented in the hope of avoiding the crime of violating the treaty is, in fact, the crime of violating the treaty, which has become clearer.</p>

<h3>Norwegian Youth Invents New Type of Sound Receiver</h3>
<p>Exceptionally Sensitive, the Fluttering of a Fly's Wings Can Be Clearly Heard</p>
<p>Reuters, Helsinki Correspondence -- A Norwegian young student, Larsen, invented a new type of sound receiver. With this, he can hear the conversation of two flies. It was recently tested at the Oslo University of Entomology in Norway. The instrument is very sensitive and can indicate the number of wing flaps when a fly flies. Even if it flaps its wings ten thousand times per second, it can be accurately noted. Larsen claims that he can use this instrument to listen to the sound of two insects rubbing their antennae or touching their sensory organs to talk. He hopes to solve the "insect language" problem soon and contribute to world scientists.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Lushan</h3>

The military police were heavily guarded. Song stood in the warship and waved his hat to the welcomers. He then accompanied Secretary Huang Chundao and his entourage ashore, took the Third Division Headquarters' No. 3 car to the 20th room of the Zhenxing Office Building for lunch. Jiang sent the director of the Xingying Liaison Office to take care of everything. When Chinese and foreign reporters stationed in Xun arrived, Song sent Secretary Huang to meet with them. According to the conversation, the central government has a plan for the distribution of cotton and wheat loans. This time, the dignitaries came to Lushan to visit Jiang without any formal meetings, just to discuss national affairs. Presidents Sun and Wang and President Kong have all set off to Jiangxi, etc. At around 1:00 PM, Song and others took several cars and drove from Xun to Lianhua Cave, where they transferred to sedan chairs to Guling. They arrived at Jiang at around 3:00 PM. Jiang and Song met very happily. That night, Song had a long talk with Jiang at Jiang's private residence, reporting on his attendance at the economic conference and his visits to various countries. They made preliminary consultations on domestic and foreign policy issues. As soon as Wang, Sun, Kong, and others arrive in Lushan one after another, a meeting will be held to exchange opinions.

<h3>Diary of an Inspection of the Northwest Frontier (2) Feng Youzhen</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Luo Junwu, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice and Administration, was ordered to inspect Xinjiang. The reporter has already reported that Luo has arrived in Xi'an. Now, Luo has arrived in Lanzhou yesterday (29th) and will fly to Xinjiang tomorrow (31st). I will describe the past few days as follows.</p>
<h3>(8) Oppressive Continuous Rain</h3>
<p>On August 27th, it rained as soon as it dawned. Although it stopped temporarily, the overcast sky did not dissipate, showing no signs of clearing. It was known that the 8 AM flight plan would be difficult to realize again. Indeed, the air station reported that the weather was bad and it was decided that they could not fly, which was truly frustrating. After breakfast, I went to visit Wolong Temple. The temple was built during the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty. The Buddha statues and sculptures in the temple are extremely exquisite, enough to represent Eastern art. In the overcast rain, the Buddha's head drooped slightly forward, probably due to the wooden material, but it was also amazing. The temple has a very rich collection of scriptures, but they were stolen and transported by the bandit Kang Sheng during the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, and the essence was lost. Chairman Lin and Dean Dai stayed at the temple during their previous visit to Shaanxi. It is indeed a holy place for cultivating the mind. Then I went to the Confucian Temple. The temple is quite magnificent, especially the towering ancient trees, all of which are hundreds or even thousands of years old, making it rare to see. I returned to my residence at ten o'clock. It rained again in the afternoon, and I was confined indoors and did not go out. Only the President of the Local Court came to visit Minister Luo and presented a prison report. At six o'clock, Mr. Qiu Yuanwu, the president of the Xijing Daily, personally invited me to dinner. We took a donkey cart to the Northwest Hotel. The donkey cart is the only effective transportation tool in the north, but it is clumsy and unbearable. It bumps and sways during travel, making people feel like their livers and guts are about to break. It is not something that southerners are accustomed to. A strange thing happened in the Northwest Hotel today, that is, a hen laid an egg. I saw it myself. The egg was small like a ginkgo, with a dull yellow color. What was previously considered heresy is now undeniable. After returning to my residence, I read various reference documents and went to bed at midnight. On the 28th, the sky was still overcast and then continuous rain. The air station reported that the weather in Lanzhou was even worse than here, so I had to stay indoors for another day. In the afternoon, Chairman Shao and Chairman Yang Ren both came to visit Minister Luo.</p>
<p>The issue of developing the South and opening up the Northwest has been around for a long time.</p>
<h3>(9) Taking off for Lanzhou</h3>
<p>On the 29th, the rain stopped and the clouds cleared, and the sun filled the sky. It was decided to take off for Lanzhou at 9:30 AM. At 8 AM, Shao and Yang Ren both came to visit Minister Luo and continued to discuss the issue of developing the Northwest for an hour. At 9 AM, I took a car to the airport. The military and political leaders of the provincial capital, as well as the national officers and soldiers of the Special Service Regiment and the military band, gave a warm send-off at the airport. At 9:40 AM, the plane flew westward. In about an hour, we reached Liupan Mountain. The peaks and ridges were piled up like camps, winding and endless, and beautifully verdant. After passing Liupan Mountain, it was all bare, barren, and glaringly desolate. We encountered heavy fog on the way. The plane traveled bumpy and uneven, and it was extremely dangerous. Minister Luo vomited heavily because of this. Fortunately, the pilot was skilled and we arrived safely in Lanzhou.</p>
<h3>(10) Welcoming Ten Li Outside the City</h3>
<p>The Lanzhou airport is about twelve li from the city. All sectors have been looking forward to Minister Luo's arrival and have been going back and forth to welcome him for three days. At 12:30 PM, the plane landed safely. Lanzhou time was 11:30 AM, exactly one hour later than Xi'an time. Those welcoming at the airport included Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government; Deng Baoshan, Pacification Director; Ma Lin, Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Government, who had just arrived in Gansu two days ago; Shui Zi, Director of the Gansu Provincial Education Department; Liu Ruban, Director of the Construction Department; Tan Kemin, Director of the Finance Department; Wei Fuzi, Director of the Civil Affairs Department; Li Zhengzhong, Secretary-General; Ma Weiliang, Garrison Commander of the Linxia District; Zeng Youhao, President of the High Court; Zhan Shiming, Chief Prosecutor; Ling Zixing and Zhang Wenwei of the Provincial Party Committee; Cao Qiwu of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Committee; Hui leaders Ma Guoli and Ma Guodong; representatives from various agencies, schools, and mass organizations; and about two to three thousand military police. Minister Luo got off the plane amidst the music and applause of the military band, feeling dizzy. He shook hands with each of the welcoming personnel as a courtesy. After passing through the welcoming arch, he entered the city in the same car as Chairman Zhu and Chairman Ma. The enthusiasm of the border province people in supporting the central government could be seen here.</p>
<h3>(10)(1) Provincial Government Banquet</h3>
<p>Minister Luo stayed at the Provincial Government, which was formerly the Prince Su Mansion and then the Gansu-Shaanxi Governor's Mansion during the Qing Dynasty. It is extremely spacious, with a garden in the rear, leading directly to the edge of the city. Outside the city is the turbulent Yellow River. After arriving at the Provincial Government, we rested briefly and then had lunch. All the military and political leaders accompanied us. After the meal, we toured the Provincial Government's garden and climbed the Yellow Crane Tower for a panoramic view. The entire city was clearly visible. The city of Lanzhou is about ten li in circumference, two li from north to south, and seven li from east to west. Gaolan Mountain surrounds the area, and the Yellow River flows under the city. The terrain is dangerous and unparalleled. After two o'clock, Minister Luo and I went to the High Court, the Local Court, the First Prison, and the Detention Center for inspection. Zeng Youhao, President of the High Court, explained everything in detail, and Minister Luo also inquired and gave many instructions. Then we paid return visits to various important military and political leaders. At six o'clock, Chairman Zhu of the Provincial Government hosted a formal banquet, and everyone dispersed in joy. In the evening, Minister Luo and Chairman Zhu discussed the issue of developing the Northwest, and they hit it off. They talked for two or three hours before going to bed late at night. Minister Luo originally planned to fly to Hami tomorrow (30th), but due to the earnest requests from all sectors, it was decided to hold a welcome meeting tomorrow morning. The purpose of Ma Lin, Ma Weiliang, etc., is to hope that Minister Luo will stop and inspect when passing through Liangzhou and Ganzhou, so the departure date has to be postponed for one day, and the time required has to be increased slightly.</p>
<h3>(10)(2) Gansu Province Justice</h3>
<p>The situation of justice in Gansu Province can be summarized as follows: (1) Financial difficulties. Since the Northwest Army arrived in Gansu in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, due to the heavy military expenses, judicial personnel only received a maintenance fee of 20 yuan per month. Gradually, only 30 to 40 percent of that was paid. The staff worked for the public service on an empty stomach and were extremely distressed. Last year, the Provincial Government was officially established, and funding increased slightly, but it still appeared to be depleted from time to time. The President of the High Court only received a maintenance fee of 80 yuan per month, the Chief Prosecutor 70 yuan, the Clerk 50 yuan, and the Recording Secretary only 10 yuan. Even this small amount could not be paid in full every month. (2) Court organization. The High Court is located in the provincial capital, and branch courts are established in Liangzhou, Tianshui, Suzhou, and Pingliang. The Gaolan Local Court is established, and judicial offices are established in 34 counties including Lintao, Linxia, Lintan, and Minxian. The county magistrate concurrently serves as the prosecutor, and each office has one judge. The judiciary in the remaining counties is handled concurrently by the county magistrate. As for prisons, the First Prison in the provincial capital has been established, and the Second Prison in Liangzhou. New prisons have also been built in Tianshui, Pingliang, and Suzhou one after another, but either due to lack of funds for operation, they have been damaged by the stationed troops after completion, or due to insufficient construction funds, they have been abandoned halfway and have no ability to continue repairs, resulting in the abandonment of all efforts, which is very regrettable. (3) There are not many lawsuits, and the court has no backlog. The High Court handles about two to three civil appeal cases, three to four third-instance cases, two to three appeals, and eight to nine miscellaneous cases each month. The criminal appeal cases number about three to four, the criminal third-instance cases two to three, the review cases two to three, and the banditry cases one to two. In terms of the nature of the lawsuits, criminal cases are mostly homicide and theft cases. This is probably due to the strong character of the people. Civil cases concerning debt are at most only one or two thousand yuan. This shows the suffering of the people in the Northwest. Cases of fraud, enticement, and divorce, which are common in the southern provinces, are almost non-existent. Browsing through the files, I only saw one woman who, because her husband had been away for a long time and she was forced by livelihood, requested the court to allow her to remarry. This is completely different in nature from divorce cases in the South.</p>
<h3>(10)(3) Warm Welcome</h3>
<p>In Gansu Province, all sectors have decided to hold a welcome meeting at 9 AM on the 30th to express their warm welcome to Minister Luo and Ma Lin, Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Government, who have arrived in Gansu one after another. Minister Luo could not refuse, so he had to stay one more day. On the 30th, the weather was clear. At 7 AM, the Guangdong fellow villagers in Gansu held a tea party to welcome Minister Luo. There were about twenty Guangdong people in Gansu, mostly engaged in the watch and photography business. Recalling the time in Xi'an, I learned that the watch and photography industry in Xi'an was also dominated by Guangdong people. Is this a specialty of Guangdong people? At 9 AM, I attended the welcome meeting. The meeting place was the square outside the gate of the Provincial Government. There was a building on the square, which was a natural rostrum. Those who participated in the welcome meeting included more than ten thousand people from party, government, military, police, various mass organizations, and schools. Their enthusiastic and sincere emotions were incomparable to the superficial welcome meetings in the South. Here, one could see the enthusiasm of the border people in supporting the central government and their eagerness to hope that the central government would save the people from suffering. After the meeting began as scheduled, Zhu Shaoliang, the chairman, delivered the opening speech.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Followed by speeches from Minister Luo, Chairman Ma, Li Dan, a member of the Supervisory Committee residing in Gansu, and Deng Baoshan, the Pacification Director. All unanimously expressed their sincere support for the central government and their gratitude to the central government for caring about the border areas. They especially hoped that the central government would start developing the Northwest. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM. Minister Luo then went to the High Court to attend the welcome meeting of the judicial community of the entire city and delivered a speech. At noon, the legal community welcomed him for more than an hour before returning to his residence to rest. At 3 PM, the preparatory committee for the welcome meeting from all sectors held a concert at the Education Center. I had the opportunity to listen to Qinqiang opera. Although I was ignorant of the meaning, the impassioned and tragic songs and the激昂tone were clearly different from the靡靡之音 in the South. At 6 PM, all sectors held a banquet, with more than a hundred people attending. At 8 PM, I returned to the Provincial Government and received a telegram from Chairman Chiang. Ma Bufang, commander of the 9th Division of Qinghai, and Ma Buqing, commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division of Liangzhou, also sent telegrams. Mr. Ma Buqing also strongly requested Minister Luo to stay in Liangzhou for a short visit. It is scheduled to fly to Liangzhou tomorrow (31st), but I don't know what the weather will be like tomorrow morning. The plane that flew out of Xi'an at 5 AM this morning is still missing as of the time of writing. It may have encountered an accident. This section of the flight is extremely dangerous if the weather is not good.</p>
<h3>(10)(4) Impressions of Lanzhou</h3>
<p>I have been staying in Lanzhou for two days, busy with social events, and there is no time to spare. Although the enthusiasm of all parties is appreciable, I am ultimately disappointed that I have not been able to see the social conditions of Lanzhou. The city of Lan is surrounded by mountains on all sides and faces the river on one side. The terrain is extremely dangerous. The streets are narrow and uneven. On the surface, it seems inferior to Xi'an, but in reality, it is even worse. It is said that the climate here is excellent. The hottest in summer is no more than eighty-two or three degrees, and the winter is not as cold as Nanjing. It is only slightly dry. The land is extremely fertile. The melons, fruits, and vegetables that are produced in Jiangzhe are all produced here, and they are much larger and more fertile. However, water conservancy is not well-maintained, and farmers rely entirely on the weather. If the rainfall is harmonious, the yield of one year is enough for three years, but if the weather is not suitable, they are helpless. Gansu Province is rich in products. Medicinal materials occupy the most important position in the country, and wool is also a major product. Coal oil is readily available in the Yumen area. There are many other things that cannot be mentioned. Unfortunately, due to traffic obstruction and inconvenient transportation, the goods needed by this province from other provinces are also extremely expensive due to inconvenient transportation. Now, let's give an example: Meili brand cigarettes, which can be purchased for two yuan per can in Beijing and Shanghai, cost two yuan per can here. The value of other goods is four or five times higher. The transportation in Gansu Province relies on donkey carts on land and oxhide rafts on the water. Oxhide rafts are made of six or seven or more than ten whole cowhides, stuffed with wool, and connected to form a raft that can float on the water. It flows downstream and is quite fast. All goods transported from Gansu to Sui rely on this as a sharp tool, but it cannot go upstream. Therefore, after arriving in Sui, it is dismantled and carried back to Gansu. Such is the endless cycle. Therefore, what the people of the Northwest expect from the central government's development of the Northwest does not require grand plans. Their only hope is to develop transportation. The first hope is to complete the Longhai Railway, and the second is to complete the various highways. If the roads are smooth, transportation will be convenient, and if water conservancy can be further improved, the people of the Northwest will not have to worry about freezing and starvation, and prosperity can be expected. If it is not developed, it will develop itself. (August 30, sent from Lanzhou)</p>
<h3>North China Compatriots Mourn the National Tragedy Together</h3>
<p>He Yingqin and Huang Shaohong Preside Over the Memorial Service; Relatives of the Martyrs Cry Bitterly at the Venue</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The North China Anti-Japanese War Martyrs Conference, organized by the Beiping Military Branch, held a public memorial service at the Tianwang Hall of Beihai Park, starting at 9 AM on the 4th and ending at 6 PM. At 8 PM, a Dharma boat was burned. More than ten thousand Chinese and foreign people attended the memorial service. He Yingqin, Acting Chairman of the Military Branch, presided over the memorial service on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek. Huang Shaohong, Minister of the Interior, presided over the memorial service on behalf of Wang Zhaoming. Zhao Shuyong, a member of the Political Consolidation Committee, participated in the memorial service on behalf of Huang Fu. In addition to preparing all the memorial rituals, the association also invited monks from Guangji Temple, Taoists from Baiyun Temple, and Lamas from Yonghe Palace to chant scriptures, and made large paper Dharma boats and towers to transcend the dead souls. In addition, the 67th Army Headquarters originally planned to hold a memorial service for the Anti-Japanese War Martyrs of the 67th Army on July 2nd at the Langfang defense line. It has notified all parties and invited them to participate in the memorial service. As a result, Beijing merged with the Beiping conference. All the elegiac couplets sent by various parties that the army received, more than ten pieces, were sent to the conference by the adjutant Tong to be hung up. The situation of the memorial service is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrangement and Vigilance</h3>
<p>Plain-colored arches were built in front of and outside the North Sea Gate and the Tianwang Hall. The hall was covered with mourning couplets and wreaths. Lamas, Taoists, and monks chanted scriptures in the east, west, and south. The band played mourning music with the memorial service. The portrait of the Prime Minister was hung high in the hall, with the party and national flags crossed. Below were the tablets and portraits of the martyrs. Small flags were inserted between the trees on the road from the back gate of Beihai to the Tianwang Hall, with the words "It is an honor to die for the country." Military police with guns were stationed at each gate and on the roads around the sea. Anyone without an admission pass was not allowed to enter. The arrangements were orderly, and the vigilance was strict.</p>
<h3>Situation of the Public Memorial Service</h3>
<p>The public memorial service began at 9 AM, presided over by He Yingqin and Huang Shaohong. Among the dignitaries who participated in the public memorial service were Jiang Bocheng, Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Qian Dajun, Huang Jie, Xu Tingyao, He Zhuguo, Hu Jiesan, San Shouxin, Wei Yisan, He Jingwu, Gao Guizi, Wang Yizhe, Liu Shifu as Song Zheyuan’s representative, Zhang Zhengfang, Bao Gang, Bao Wenyou, Wu KeRen, Tan Qinglin, Liu Yaowu as Liu Zhi's representative, the 15th Route Army and Bai Ruilin as Ningxia Province representative, Wang Zhengping as Wu Peifu’s representative, and Li Hongwen as Yan Xishan’s representative, who bowed three times to the martyrs. Then, the heads of departments and groups of the Military Branch, and the officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth Army, the Second Division, the Sixty-seventh Army, the Third Regiment of the Gendarmerie, and the Thirty-second Army, successively paid their respects. Starting at 1 PM in the afternoon, the Political Consolidation Committee, represented by Zhao Shuyong on behalf of Huang Fu, paid their respects. Next, the municipal government bureaus and Public Security Bureau Chief Bao Yulin led the district chiefs to pay their respects. Subsequently, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Pinghan Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various legal groups, and schools successively paid their respects. At 4:30 PM, Spanish Minister Galide, representing the diplomatic corps, arrived to pay their respects. The Military Branch sent counselors Shen Xi, Wang Weixin, and Zhao Qianchen to be responsible for reception. Among the family members of the martyrs who went to pay their respects were the wife of Jin Dingchen and Jin's children. Mrs. Jin wore a blue cheongsam. When performing the ceremony, she was horrified to see the remains. The old mother of Guan Huangquan, a company commander of the 109th Division, also came to the venue and cried out in grief.</p>
<h3>Abstract of Elegiac Couplets</h3>
<p>The garden of elegiac couplets was hung all over the corridors and under the canopies of the front and rear halls, totaling thousands. All military and political organs, including Chairman Lin, had offerings. The plaque presented by Chairman Lin was "National Tragedy Forever." Wang Jingwei's couplet was "Come and enjoy the inheritance of the dance, playing iron is still like changing the sun-shooting bow." Chiang Kai-shek's couplet was "The righteousness is as thin as the clouds, defending Tianjin and thinking of the martyrs; the battle achievements are inscribed on bamboo and silk, and the incense is offered to comfort the loyal souls." Xu Yongchang's couplet was "The Longcheng Wanli could not resist the rampant sea bandits, the Gubeikou and Xifengkou were cold, the beacon fires were continuous, the iron horses and golden swords, the comrades competed to rush to the disaster, five thousand sable brocades, who is not a generous man, the Qin clouds, Yan trees, and Wujiang, where is the hometown, the Yingtai White Tower, the autumn wind and autumn rain for recruiting souls." Liu Xiang's couplet was "Smashing the head to resist the powerful 胡, the heroic spirits who died are magnificent rivers and mountains, heartbreaking and painful situation, the soul comes with blood and tears filling the passes and mountains." He Chengjun's couplet was "Martyred for the country in distant borders, regardless of fame or name, all shining heroic spirits for thousands of years, painful comrades in arms leave many regrets, regardless of the early or late death, together vent their grief and indignation this morning."</p>
<h3>Ronin Want to Worship</h3>
<p>Xu Yingtan, director of the memorial service preparatory committee, said that the preparations were rushed and there were many shortcomings. It was originally scheduled to be held for three days, but it was changed to one day after a meeting decision. The budget was set at 5,000 yuan. Since it has been changed to one day, it may be saved. The tablets and portraits of the martyrs supplied are all officials, totaling more than 5,000. There are as many as 10,000 elegiac couplets and wreaths, which shows that the hearts of the people have not died. As for the Beihai gate today, the security is very strict. A ronin from a certain country disguised as a Chinese, trying to force his way into the gate to visit, was discovered by the military police in front of the gate and refused to enter because the ronin had no admission pass. Beihai Park usually burns flower boxes and transports lights on the evening of today (i.e., July 15th of the lunar calendar). The authorities, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, allowed tickets to be sold as usual at 4 PM this afternoon, allowing people to visit, but visitors are not allowed to enter the Tianwang Hall until the memorial service is over.

<h3>Liu Wenhui's troops are led by Xiang Yuren</h3>
<p>Liu's troops still have 30,000 men who have not decided to enter Xikang</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Since Liu Wenhui left Ya'an, Liu's troops have been led by Xiang Yuren. The military affairs in southern Sichuan have come to an end. What remains to be concluded is the issue of reorganizing the remnant troops of Liu's army on the west bank of the Ya River. Therefore, Liu Xiang's and Deng Xihou's troops are still preparing to cross the river to urge Liu's troops to submit. It is heard that Liu's troops still have about 30,000 men. Liu Wenhui originally wanted to organize all the troops into twenty regiments, with ten regiments stationed in Xikang and ten regiments stationed in Ning District. Later, due to the continued pressure of Liu Deng's troops on the army, and most of the officers and soldiers of the army refused to be stationed in Kang and Ning, and even Kang and Ning were unable to supply this huge military quota, the original proposal was abandoned. The troops stationed in Tianling and Ya'an were handed over to Xiang Yuren for command, so that Xiang could come forward to request Liu Xiang to recruit them, and beg Liu Deng to stop advancing. Liu Wenhui then led his most trusted troops, Liu Wentang, Gao Yucong, Zhu Yinzhou, Qing Hannan, etc., to be stationed in Kang and Ning. There were originally three regiments of Deng Pancun's Brigade stationed in Xikang, and three regiments of Liu Zhulin's troops stationed in Ningyuan. Together with the troops led by Liu Wenhui from Ya'an, there could be sixteen regiments. After Liu left Ya'an, he advanced and stationed in Rongjing, and then moved from Rongjing to Hanyuan. It is heard that he will temporarily stay in Hanyuan or go to Xichang to await the results of Xiang Yuren's request to Liu Xiang. Liu believes that since the troops he leads are limited, it is better to have a foothold in Sichuan than to seek food in other provinces, which is more secure. Liu Zhucun's troops are deploying military forces on the Dadu River, setting up guards along the coast. Liu Wenhui previously sent two regiments to Xichang to help Liu defend it, fearing that after Liu Deng's troops crossed the Ya River, they would thoroughly eliminate the army. Therefore, he dared not rashly retreat into Xikang, because after entering Kang, food and rice must be transported from Ningya to supply military food. If the Luding Bridge is blocked, the troops entering Kang will sit and wait for death. If the counties in Ning are very rich in rice production, and the grain price is low, which is unmatched by other counties in Sichuan, if they retreat to Ning, they will be blockaded by Liu Deng's troops, and the supply will not become a problem. Holding the Dadu River on one side and the Daxiang Ridge on the other, it is enough to defend with danger. If Liu Deng's troops do not advance in the future, Kangning and Rongjing Hanyuan counties can be preserved. It is not too late to enter Kang at this time. Therefore, Liu Wenhui today is still hovering on the wrong path. (September 3rd)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Northern Sichuan Are Stirring</h3>
<p>Bandits Invading Various Counties of Jiancang Were Repelled; the Bandit Suppression Force Decided to Have 100 Regiments</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The Red Bandits in northern Sichuan, now that the military affairs of the two Lius have ended, knowing that the Sichuan army will devote all its efforts to suppressing them in the future, and it will be difficult to survive, suddenly attacked Min, Cang, Yi, and Guang counties in an attempt to strike first. Fortunately, the troops of Tian Songyao made every effort to defend them, and the bandits did not succeed and were mostly killed. The situation has been slightly frustrated. Now Liu Xiang has engaged in the allocation of bandit suppression troops, limiting the time to thoroughly clear the bandits. The bandit harm in northern Sichuan and the allocation of bandit suppression troops are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Xiangqian, the bandit in northern Sichuan, now has more than 30,000 guns and nearly 50,000 to 60,000 people. They are extremely sturdy. Among the communist bandits, he is the strongest except for Zhu De. However, he is cruel by nature and considers killing as his ability. The old are killed, the young are killed, the rich are killed, and the knowledgeable are killed. The established laws for killing are as many as forty-eight kinds, and the tragic situation can be generally seen. Previously, due to a love triangle conflict with Zhang Guoshou (Zhang's cousin Qinqiu and Xu Zhang had private affairs, and the two had been fighting secretly for a long time and would not give in to each other), and the struggle for power, two major camps were formed, and internal strife was quite fierce. Seeing that the Sichuan army was about to launch a large-scale suppression, they launched a large-scale attack on Lang, Cang, Yi, and Guang counties. The troops of Tian Songyao, Liu Hanxiong, and Li Weiru have been advancing one after another to prevent the bandits from advancing, either ten or twenty miles a day, or fifty or sixty miles, step by step. It is heard that the Red Army that departed from Langzhong has reached Puziyan, and the Wang Mingzhang troops have reached Baichipo, the border between Ba and Yi. The bandits have heard the news and retreated to Tong, Nan, Jiangcheng, and the surrounding mountains. The pseudo-division commander Wang Hongmin's troops and the pseudo-28th Regiment Wang's troops and the 31st Regiment, originally stationed in Jiulong, Changle, Longfeng, Zhuguguan, etc., have now gathered in Nanjiang day and night, and it is heard that Xu Xiangqian, Zhang Guoshou, etc., plan to concentrate the main force of the bandits in Changchi, hoping to resist stubbornly. The other key points of Tongnan are guarded by newly organized guerrillas who attack and defend at their discretion. However, the bandit suppression army has stationed heavy troops in Tumen Field, Wei Jialiang, Huanglao Temple, Xinglong Field, Guan Gong Field, and other places, with strict defenses. Although the communist bandits in Yibajie and other places come and go from time to time, they have been repelled by the government army. Now Liu Hanxiong's division has driven the Red Bandits more than thirty miles away from Guang. Seeing that their plan did not succeed, the bandits looted the people's grain on a large scale. The people in the city, seeing their cruelty, wanted to escape. Liu immediately issued a notice explaining that if there were any unforeseen circumstances, he would coexist with Guangcheng and advised the people not to panic and avoid suffering from displacement. The people did not relocate.</p>
<p>As for Liu Xiang's plan to suppress the bandits, he has agreed with Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, etc. He decided to draw bandit suppression troops from each army, temporarily with the regiment as the unit, and a total of 100 regiments will be drawn from the entire Sichuan. Ten airplanes will be added to assist the various armies in suppressing the bandits, and they will be cleared in one fell swoop. (September 1st, Guowen Agency)</p>
<h3>Overview of Qingdao Fisheries</h3>
<p>The Great Sea Benefits are Seized by Foreigners; The Gains of National Fishermen are Very Small</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Qing City is located outside the Yellow Sea, with Jiaozhou Bay inside. The bay and harbor are naturally formed, and the islands are lined up. During the spring and autumn seasons, schools of fish migrate and inhabit the nearby sea in abundance. It is truly a great fishing ground on the coast of our country. Unfortunately, most fishermen stick to old methods and do not know how to improve. Therefore, forty years have passed since the port was opened, and various industries have been developing day by day, but the fishing industry has not made progress. Since the third year of the Republic of China, the Japanese occupied Qingdao and vigorously encouraged their fishermen to fish, and established a water production association to handle loan sales and other matters, so that the Qing city fishing industry was manipulated by them. Since the takeover, efforts have been made to rectify it, but due to the frequent changes of government decrees, it has not been possible to actively handle it. Since the Bohai Fleet stationed in Qingdao in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, patrolling and protecting the area and maintaining maritime rights, the fishing industry has begun to improve. After the promotion by the Municipal Social Bureau, wealthy businessmen in the city were persuaded to organize the Qingdao Fisheries Company, which was officially established two years ago. In the past two years, the results have been quite impressive. The overview of the fishing industry is investigated separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Fishing Boat Quantities</h3>
<p>The residents along the coast of Qingdao and on the various islands, due to the barren land and customary practices, engage in farming for only about one or two tenths of their livelihood, while the rest are engaged in fishing. In 1915, according to a Japanese survey, the Yin Island area had 330 fishing boats and over 1,300 fishermen, with the value of the catch estimated at 25,000 yuan. The Shazikou area had 300 fishing boats and rafts, and over 1,200 fishermen, with the value of the catch estimated at 100,000 yuan. Smaller fishing villages were not included in the statistics. Furthermore, according to a 1926 survey report by the Fisheries and Navigation Bureau, the Qingdao area had over 1,400 fishing boats and 11,000 fishermen. Additionally, around 1917, when the Japanese organized a fisheries association in Qingdao, about 9,200 Chinese fishermen joined. According to recent surveys by the Hebei-Shandong Marine Fisheries Administration and the Qingdao Fisheries Company, Qingdao now has approximately 10,000 fishermen and over 1,400 fishing boats. The fishing areas within the bay are centered around Yin Island, while offshore fishing is centered around Shazikou and Jianggezhuang, extending east beyond Bachidun (Eight Thousand Mounds) to the Q千里島 (Thousand Mile Island), south to Tasu Island and Shuilingshan Island, and to Shidao (Stone Island) within 崂山 (Laoshan) Bay.</p>
<h3>Fishermen's Lives</h3>
<p>The lives of fishermen, due to the adventurous nature of their work and lack of education, are often dissolute. Most of their hard-earned income is spent on prostitution, gambling, eating, and drinking. Before fishing, all expenses are mostly borrowed from fisheries brokers. After returning with the catch, they sell it to repay the loans. The funds that fisheries brokers lend to fishermen are borrowed from fisheries companies. It is said that fisheries companies provide these interest-free loans, releasing over 60,000 to 70,000 yuan annually. The fishing season is divided into spring and autumn seasons. The spring season is from mid-March to mid-May in the lunar calendar, mainly using nets. The autumn season is from late June to early September in the lunar calendar, mainly using trawls. As for the harvesting of shellfish, it can be collected along the coast at any time. The Nvgv (Nvgu) and Shuangbu areas within the Qingdao area bay are particularly abundant, with harvests even in winter.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing</h3>
<p>The Japanese began fishing in this city around 1914, following the Japanese army. Due to the various advantages given by their government, the most prosperous period was around 1916, when they almost seized our fishing grounds and occupied them. In 1915 and 1916, Qingdao had over 130 Japanese fishing boats. Currently, there are still 45 boats. The production of "Jiaji fish" (加級魚) along the Qingdao coast (this fish is a high-quality food, worth about five or six cents per pound) is extremely abundant and occupies an important sales market in this city. This kind of fresh fish is sold throughout the year, mostly caught by the Japanese. During the spring and autumn fishing seasons, the Japanese use large sailing ships or steamers to fish in the Haizhou area, while smaller boats travel to Shuilingshan Island, Daxiaogong Island, Talian Island, and the 千里島 (Thousand Mile Island) area. Even in winter when there are fewer fish, they send small boats to the south of Talian Island to harvest. A large sailing ship can earn over 7,000 yuan per year, while a small boat can earn over 2,000 yuan. The catch of our Chinese fishing boats is far less than that. Also, around 1916, the Japanese government, to encourage the catching of croaker, specially selected five sailing ships with excellent performance and provided funds, ordering them to go to Talian Island and Shidao in Laoshan Bay to try to catch croaker. Each ship averaged about 500 yuan in catch. Since then, the Japanese have often caught croaker in these places in winter. The fishing tools used by the Japanese include line fishing, cast nets, lift nets, drift nets, trawls, and diving equipment. Besides the Jiaji fish, which is the most numerous, there are also sharks, flounder, sea perch, pomfret, abalone, sea cucumber, and agar.</p>
<h3>Protecting Fisheries</h3>
<p>The coastal areas of Qi are originally rich fishing areas in our country, and the coastal areas of Qingdao have particularly large yields. However, because our Chinese fishermen adhere to old methods and do not seek new knowledge, this great maritime profit is seized by foreigners. In 1914, when the Japanese army occupied Qingdao, Japanese fishermen came along and encroached and harvested without being restrained. It was not until 1927, when the Bohai Fleet came to Qingdao to garrison, that measures were taken to protect fisheries, maintain maritime rights, and divide the area between the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea into four zones: the first zone from south of Cangzhou Island to the vicinity of Haizhou; the second zone from north of Cangzhou Island to the Chengshantou area; the third zone from Chengshantou to the border between Huang County and Zhaoyuan; and the fourth zone from the border between Huang and Zhao counties to the nearby sea north of the Dagu River. Warships were dispatched to each zone to protect them. During the fishing season, in addition to protecting fisheries and maintaining order, they also cracked down on steamships forcibly buying fish and foreign fishing boats entering territorial waters to fish. They were able to effectively intervene, and the practice of Japanese crossing the sea to fish was reduced somewhat. Recently, the Hebei-Shandong Marine Fisheries Administration established an office in Qingdao and rented two steamships to engage in protection. In the future, our country's fisheries should gradually develop. (September 6)</p>
<h3>News from Wutun and Wuzha Roads</h3>
<p>Wutun Road Expected to be Completed Soon, Wuzha Road Under Active Construction</p>
<p>Wuhu correspondence: The Wuhu-Tunxi Road is one of the largest construction projects of this year by the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction. The Huihang Road has already been opened to traffic. Once the Wutun Road is completed, it can be connected to that road. With convenient transportation between Wuhu and Hangzhou, the products of southern Anhui will flow unimpeded, which is of great importance to culture and commerce. Recently, Liu Yiyan, the Director of the Department of Construction, has appointed Jin Youzhu, a technical officer, as the supervising committee member for the road. The road starts from Wuhu, crosses Xuancheng to Ningguo, passes through Jixi, and reaches Tunxi. The most difficult section, Ningguo to Jixi, is nearing completion. It is expected that by the end of this year, Wuhu can be connected to Jixi. In the past, it took people from various counties in Huizhou seven or eight days to travel to Wuhu. In the future, it will only take one day.</p>
<p>After the Jiangnan Railway Company held a groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the Wuzha Railway, Hong Shen, the chief engineer, was responsible for actively carrying it out in Wuhu. No less than four or five thousand workers are working day and night on earth filling. The Wuhu to Wangzhi section is expected to be completed this year, and the Wangzhi to Sunjiabu section will also be completed next spring. After that section is completed, the Wusun section will be opened to traffic first. Currently, long-distance telephones are being installed and are expected to be operational within three months. More than eighty culverts and the Ningxiang Great Iron Bridge are all out for tender. (5th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang County Asks for Funds to Repair Seawalls</h3>
<p>The Jinshanzui seawall in this county was in danger last year. Xu Baikui, Director of the Construction Bureau, repaired it, converting the second and third sections into reinforced concrete structures. A Shanghai construction company contracted the work, which cost a considerable amount. However, the reinforced concrete structure could not withstand the impact of the waves and was not as durable as the old method of wooden stakes and stone embankments. It gradually collapsed, and the effect was minimal. The other day, a hurricane struck, and the people of Songjiang were very worried. Fortunately, there was no danger. However, if the seawall is not repaired for a long time, it is feared that danger will occur when the autumn flood arrives. The lives and property of the people of Songjiang are greatly affected. Last month, Gao Yihan, a supervising commissioner of the Supervisory Yuan, inspected the seawall and believed that the Jinshanzui seawall needed to be repaired. He requested the provincial government to allocate funds for repairs on behalf of the people. Now, Jin Zhuan of the county government, based on the dangerous condition of the seawall, has submitted a report to the provincial government requesting the allocation of funds for seawall repairs and has also submitted a valuation report.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Dean Lin Goes to Shanghai for Inspection</h3>
<p>Lin Biao, the President of the Jiangsu High Court, went to Shanghai by car yesterday (the 6th) to inspect the new buildings of the Caohejing Second Prison, which are about to be completed, and also to inspect the Shanghai Special District Local Court and the detention center.</p>
<h3>Completion of Tianping Road Project</h3>
<p>Tianping Mountain in Mudu Township is the most famous scenic spot in Wu County. However, transportation is inconvenient, and tourists have to walk there. Now, the Second District Office has initiated the construction of Tianping Road (from Mudu directly to the foot of Tianping Mountain), which has been completed. A traffic ceremony will be held on the 10th of this month. The Department of Construction and the county government have been requested to send personnel to participate. After this, vehicles can go directly from Suzhou to Tianping Mountain.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Rice Boat Robbed in Wangting</h3>
<p>Wuxi Wanlongcheng Rice Store hired a boat to transport more than one hundred shi of brown rice to a rice store in Loumen, Suzhou, for delivery. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 6th) at 10:00 AM, when sailing near Wangting Township, they suddenly encountered a bandit boat with six or seven bandits armed with weapons. They robbed the boat, taking away more than one hundred yuan in cash and the boat owner Zhou Chunshan's clothes, etc., with a loss of about three hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>The Enthusiastic Triumph of the Wuxi National Games</h3>
<p>The Second District National Games were held in Wujin this time. The male and female athletes from this county, because of their skilled training and excellent results, caused the counties of Wujin, Yixing, and Jiangyin to be defeated. As a result, Wuxi won a total of seven general championships and classified championships. The remaining gold, silver, and bronze medals, silk flags, and mirror frames were countless, accounting for two-thirds of the conference. Yesterday, the male and female athletes returned in full dress. When the train passed through Loshe and Shitangwan in the county, the villagers set off firecrackers to celebrate, and the shouts of joy mingled together. When they arrived at the Wuxi station, the station was crowded with people, flags were flying, and firecrackers and military music were played together. All the athletes were happy and excited. The enthusiastic situation was no less than when the revolutionary army arrived in Wuxi during the Northern Expedition. After the athletes got off the train, they marched around the city in formation to the park. Zang Fogen, the Director of the Education Bureau, prepared refreshments to reward the three armies and held a consolation meeting. Director Zang and Pu Yicheng, the representative of the county party headquarters, gave speeches, which were very grand for a time.</p>
<h3>The Second Day of the Autumn Cocoon Market Opening</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the autumn cocoon market opening. Goods from the southwest countryside were still pouring in, and the cocoons were also of good quality. The Zhongqiao Dachang Cocoon Firm received seventy or eighty dan of goods, with a high price of forty yuan. Next was the Hutai Yongtaihe, which received about seventy dan of goods, with a high price of thirty-five yuan and inferior goods at twenty-five yuan. Other cocoon firms in Zhangcun, Sitou, Yanqiao, Hujiadu, Chang'anqiao, Dongting, Bashiqiao, Zhangjingqiao, Zhouxin Township, Nanqiao, Shitangwan, Shitang Township, Daqiangmen, Qianzhou, Loshe, Zhiqi, Beiqifang, and Meicun also received a large influx of goods, with prices hovering around thirty yuan. The Qianqiao Yangting and Zhangshe areas are scheduled to open tomorrow. Yesterday, the Cocoon Industry Association received thirty-four more applications to open, bringing the total to one hundred and eleven. In Meicun Township in the tenth district, the Tailun and Juyuan firms arbitrarily reduced cocoon prices when they saw that there were many cocoon sellers, which aroused dissatisfaction among the villagers, who made trouble with the two firms. Later, the town's security regiment came out to maintain order and ordered them to follow the association's resolution and handle the matter with discretion before it could be quelled. Also, yesterday, more than ten villagers from the northern road border between Wuxi and Cheng in Taipingqiao Gongyichang Cocoon Firm in the sixth district brought cocoons to sell. The firm immediately lowered the price because the cocoons were soft. At that time, a few hooligans intentionally made trouble, making a lot of noise outside the firm, which was unreasonable. Ji Quansheng, the manager of the firm, came out to persuade them, but somehow fell to the ground and died. The cocoon-selling villagers, seeing that a disaster had occurred, all scattered.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Provincial Department Investigates Old Tax Debts</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance stated that the total amount of provincial taxes owed by various counties in this province from 1927 to 1931 reached more than seven million (excluding various surtaxes). It has already formulated measures to clear old taxes and appointed Li Guoqi as the Jiangyin Tax Clearing Commissioner, who came to Cheng on the 4th. After contacting the county government, it was found that Jiangyin owed about two million one hundred thousand yuan in old land taxes from 1927 to 1931, of which nearly nine hundred thousand yuan was owed to the provincial treasury. The proposed method of clearing and urging payment this time is to divide the county into seven districts, with one commissioner assigned to each district to copy the amounts owed by the handling clerks and guarantors from the land tax office and go to various townships to check and verify them. These measures will be implemented after Commissioner Li returns to the province and obtains approval.</p>
<h3>Drugs Seized on Zhengda Steamer</h3>
<p>He Yalin, the Director of the Fourth Branch of the Cheng Drug Investigation Office, received a report from Xu Asan of Shanghai that the Datong Company's Shanghai-Yangzhou Zhengda steamer was carrying a large amount of morphine, red pills, etc. After receiving the report, Director He waited for the steamer to arrive at Huangtiangang from Shanghai at about 10:00 PM on the 4th, then took the Fuyan patrol boat to the steamer's laogui (engineer) room and found several pounds of morphine, worth four or five hundred yuan, more than ten pounds of red pills, about one or two hundred thousand pills, and a full set of smoking paraphernalia. He then detained the laogui (yesterday's telegram mistakenly said mate), Tang Xinglan, a native of Yangjing Town, Pudong, and the cook, a native of Liuhe. The Zhengda steamer, because it had no laogui, immediately dropped anchor. At that time, the Jiangyin Datong branch, for the sake of passengers and goods, urgently needed to go to Yangzhou and repeatedly requested Director He to have Zhang Xinglan temporarily bailed out by the staff Wang Ying. The steamer sailed to Yangzhou at about 1:00 AM this morning (the 5th) and will hand over Zhang to the Zhen for interrogation after finding another steamer's laogui.</p>
<h3>The Descendant of a Zhenjiang Warlord Drifts to Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The late warlord Zhang Zongchang had twenty-three concubines during his lifetime. After he was assassinated by Zheng Zhishi, his family gave the concubines money to dismiss them. His thirteenth concubine, Wu Ruiji, is now twenty-four years old and a native of Fengtian. She is of ordinary appearance. After getting money in Ping, she went to live in Shanghai. She became acquainted with a man surnamed Mou from Shangdang Township in this city and came to Zhenjiang to live for half a year. Wu was not accustomed to living in the countryside and broke up with Mou. Through Wang's introduction, she married Zhao Zhenhua, the former Director of the Huaiyin Public Security Bureau, and lived with him in the Anle Inn opened by Zhao on Nanmen Street, which was very harmonious. Last night, for some reason, they suddenly quarreled and then used force. They wrestled in a ball on Shengfu Road. After investigation, the police brought them to the Second Branch Bureau. Wu insisted on divorcing her husband. After Zhao inquired, he persuaded both parties to settle it peacefully outside.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Dada Steamer Adds Zhenshao Route</h3>
<p>The Neihe Dada Steamer Company's newly built small steamer (Gongxin) will be dedicated to the Zhenshao route and was launched on the 5th. It departs from Zhen every morning at 7:00 AM, arrives in Yangzhou at 9:00 AM to unload passengers, and then opens to Shao. It departs from Shao at 12:00 PM to Yangzhou and then departs from Yangzhou to Zhen at 2:00 PM. It has also negotiated terms with Fu Yun, Xiehe, and other eight companies, and will take turns to open to Qingjiang and other places on schedule, with uniform fares, to maintain business and benefit travelers.</p>
<h3>Nantong Sanyu Bandits Riot and Seize Weapons</h3>
<p>A large group of bandits gathered in Tongxing Township, Suyu District, Nantong, cut off telephone lines, rioted, and attempted to seize weapons from the garrisoned Jiaziwei police regiment. The police regiment resisted, and the Special Industrial Police Team from Beixingqiao attacked. The bandits fled to the sea in Hengxin Township.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Jiashen Taozhuang Huge Theft Case</h3>
<p>The Jiashen Taozhuang Town Taiheyuan Rice Store robbery case, which caused a great uproar, is still unknown. It is now known that Taiheyuan was exclusively opened by Sun Yancai, Chairman of the Jiashen Chamber of Commerce, and has been in business for decades. Its business is the largest in the county, and it has long been coveted by bandits. This time, the store had a sum of township funds, totaling more than 4,000 yuan, hidden in a silver box. Few outsiders knew about it, but the bandits knew about it. Taking advantage of the absence of manager Lu Chunling, they went together. When the partners were taking the money, the fellows were aware of it and intended to announce it. They were threatened by the thieves with a pistol and allowed them to take away all the money. Therefore, a bullet was left behind when they left. It is a misunderstanding that the outside world says the thieves had their own keys. The water and land police and the local defense regiments have been notified to strictly search and arrest the bandits.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Security Office Executes Two Kidnappers</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Office, according to the Hang County and 临安 (Linan) County Governments, presented and escorted three bandit Yang Shouyu, Li Azhong, Han Youcai etc., involved in the kidnapping case of Yang Shizhen, son of Yang Zhiliang of Shuangtiaoba. After interrogation, it was found that the bandit Yang Shouyu lived next to Yang Zhiliang and knew that he had money. He had the idea of kidnapping and redeeming him, and invited Li Azhong, Han Youcai, and the executed La Jinmao and the fugitive Big Foot A Lian and others. On the night of the 23rd day of the third month of the old calendar this year, they went to his house and kidnapped his four-year-old son and hid him in La Jinmao's house. They got a ransom of 230 yuan and returned the hostage. Except for Han Youcai, whose circumstances were lighter and was sentenced to imprisonment, the rest were sentenced to death according to the law. Yesterday (the 6th) at 8:00 AM, staff were sent to bring Yang Shouyu and Li Azhong to verify their identities and tie them to the execution ground outside Qingbomen to be executed by shooting.</p>
<h3>Lu Xing'er, Please Note</h3>
<p>Since you traveled far away, it has been three months. Your mother cries and your wife wails. How can your heart bear it? The past is gone, and I will not pursue it. Only your ambition is followed. I hope you will return to your original residence in Shanghai soon to discuss face-to-face, which may be helpful. If you lack travel funds, please send a letter home or to Lin's residence at 77 Liulin Villa, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai Public Concession, and I will remit the money to dispel doubts. Sincerely, Father.</p>

<h3>Sun Tonggang, in a Great National Flight, Flew From Beijing to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Participated in the Naming Ceremony of the Five Aircrafts, Will Fly to Hangzhou on the 10th, and Return to Germany for Research After One Month. The Municipal Government Hosted a Banquet Last Night and the Party Headquarters Hosted a Lunch Today.</p>
<p>Sun Tonggang, a young pilot studying in Germany, previously flew a single-wing land plane from Germany to his motherland over a long distance, experiencing all kinds of hardships and earning a national reputation. He then returned to his ancestral home in Shandong Province to visit his relatives. Later, due to the enthusiastic welcome letters and telegrams from people all over the country, Sun decided to make a national flight with the aim of saving the country through aviation. On the 5th, he flew from Jinan with Wang Zuwen, passing through Xuzhou and Bengbu, and arrived in Beijing. After a short stay, he flew to Shanghai from Beijing at 9:45 yesterday morning and arrived safely at Hongqiao Airport at 11:50. Various agencies and groups in this city sent representatives to the airport to welcome him. The enthusiastic situation was extremely grand. The municipal government hosted a banquet for Sun last night at 7:00 PM. This afternoon, the city party headquarters hosted a lunch at the Shanghai United Association. Sun said that after participating in the naming ceremony of the five aircrafts in Shanghai, he will fly to Hangzhou on the morning of the 10th and then fly to various places. It is expected that the entire trip can be completed in about a month, and then he will go to Germany to continue his research. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Representatives from various agencies and groups, such as the Two Special Party Headquarters, the South Goods Industry Union, the Shipping Guild, the Tea Making Guild, the First District Water and Electricity Union, the Tenth District Cotton Spinning Guild, and the Wharf Industry Union, totaled about 300 people.</p>
<h3>Careful Security</h3>
<p>Those on duty at the airport yesterday included one squad of the First and Middle Team of the Public Security Bureau and more than forty police officers from the Sixth District First Branch, who were stationed at the airport to keep watch, strictly protecting and prohibiting idlers from entering. The Aviation Administration also sent more than ten soldiers to guard and patrol the area. The airport police also helped maintain order and protection. A temporary shed was erected in the field for the welcoming personnel to rest, with a white cloth banner hanging above that read "Chinese Aviation Association Welcomes Aviator Sun Tonggang." A cross mark was also formed with white cloth in the center of the field to make it easier for Sun to identify and land.</p>
<h3>Landing Situation</h3>
<p>The representatives of various groups who went to welcome him held up white cloth banners with the words "Welcome Chinese Youth Pilot" written on them. The same welcome slogans were also written on white cloth banners behind the cars. All the welcoming personnel were excited and enthusiastic. From about 9:00 AM they waited until 11:50 AM, when the plane driven by Sun arrived in the sky above the airport. The whole scene erupted in thunderous applause that resounded through the clouds. The plane circled in the sky for several weeks, making a brief performance before the fuselage gradually descended. Sun frequently waved his hand to indicate his intentions. After the plane stopped, Secretary-General Yu, Lin Wojiang, Zhang Xiang and others approached the front of the plane to welcome him, shaking hands one by one. Li Dachao, a section chief of the municipal government, also presented a bouquet of flowers on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, along with close relatives Liu Zhongping and Zheng Jisheng, as well as two young ladies. Sun accepted with a smile and expressed his gratitude. The Tianchu MSG factory then presented Sun with gas masks and two small suitcases of MSG, with the words "Self-Defense for the Country" and "Work Hard for Extra Meals" written on them. At that time, Wang Zuwen immediately distributed the printed materials brought from Jinan to the welcoming personnel. Then, accompanied by Lin Wojiang, Sun and Wang took a car to the Aviation Association for rest. The municipal government also designated Cangzhou Hotel on Jingansi Road as their accommodation. Sun is now twenty-six years old and is wearing a yellow cloth Zhongshan suit with a gray wool vest and yellow twill shorts, wearing yellow leather shoes. He has a burly body and full of energy. Having been washed by the sun for a long time, his skin is red-purple. At a glance, he is known to be a determined and brave aviation hero. Wang Zuwen is Sun's classmate and is about the same age as Sun, as well as being burly and strong.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Fuselage</h3>
<p>The aircraft driven by Sun is a German 克伦姆 (Klem) single-wing aircraft with five cylinders, weighing 465 pounds, with a load capacity of 235 pounds, 90 horsepower, a normal speed of 145 kilometers per hour, and a top speed of 170 kilometers per hour. The wings are yellow in color, made of wood, and the fuselage is painted with the party emblem. On both sides of the fuselage are written the words "Save the Country Through Aviation".各界歡迎孫君留影 (徐天章攝)A group photo of all circles welcoming Sun Jun (Xu Tianzhang Photography)</p>
<p>This aircraft was purchased by Sun at his own expense a year and a half ago. The price of the aircraft was 18,000 marks, which is about 20,000 yuan in Chinese currency. The fuselage is slightly larger than the aircraft driven by Chen Wenlin, the current director of the Naval Aviation Office, four years ago.</p>
<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>After Sun and Wang got off the plane, they shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one. They then made remarks to the reporter group, saying that they departed from Nanjing at 9:45 this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) and planned to arrive here at 11:00. Later, due to headwinds on the way and because they circled over Suzhou for several weeks, their arrival was slightly delayed. They decided to participate in the naming ceremony of the five aircrafts on the 9th of this month and will fly to Hangzhou on the 10th. They plan to stay in Hangzhou for a week and then continue flying to Anqing, Hankou, Changsha, Zhumadian, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang. At that time, depending on the amount of oil, they will decide whether to fly to Lanzhou, then return to Kaifeng, and then go to Baoding, Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Suiyuan Beiping to visit the war zone. Then they will fly through Tianjin to Qingdao and back to Jinan to complete the national flight. As for Guangzhou and Hong Kong, they do not plan to go there again because they have already been there on their last return to China. They also do not plan to go to Yunnan and Sichuan because there is no oil station equipment. Their original plan for this flight was to travel with Feng Yong, but Feng's purpose was slightly different, so they gave up. After the national flight is completed, they will schedule a trip to Germany to continue their research. The purpose of this flight, at the request of all sectors of society, is to awaken the Chinese people to save the country through aviation.</p>
<h3>Distributing Flyers</h3>
<p>When Sun departed from Jinan this time, he distributed flyers along the way to awaken compatriots across the country to practice aviation to save the country. The flyer says that China is accumulating days and the foreign insults are invading, the mountains and rivers are broken, and the survival of the nation is at the last moment of life and death. In this world of air force competition, there is no way to save the country without promoting aviation. Therefore, they are making a national flight to awaken the attention and awareness of aviation among the people of the country, unite the strength of the entire country from top to bottom, and actively promote aviation, learn to drive and manufacture, cultivate talents, complete national defense, and resist foreign insults. Further, they will organize a strong air force to recover lost land, eradicate national shame, and break the insult of the sick man of East Asia, so that the country can reach the first rank in the world and restore the brilliant history of the four thousand-year-old civilized country of China. In short, it is to awaken compatriots across the country to save the country and revive the nation through aviation.龚叔窜摄Gong Shucuan photographed the municipal government's banquet for Sun Jun.</p>

<h3>Workers at the Jiangnan Rubber Factory in Jiangnan Announced a Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Opposing the factory's reduction of wages and proposing seven demands</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Rubber Factory on Wuhua Road, Hongkou, Shanghai, recently announced on the 3rd of this month that it would reduce the wages of female workers in the sneaker department by one-third due to declining business (the original wage was 6 cents per pair, now reduced to 4 cents). The female workers expressed their opposition and reported to the Fourth District Rubber Workers Union for assistance. After receiving the report, the union sent Song Yexian and Zhang Xunzhai to negotiate with the factory. Zhou Yiyan, the manager of the factory, received them and replied that if they did not agree to the wage reduction, he would dismiss all 50-odd female workers in the department and recruit new workers instead, resulting in a fruitless negotiation. The union prepared a document to petition the Party and government organs and the General Labor Union for mediation. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 4th, the factory forced the female workers in the department to sign a document acknowledging the wage reduction. Upon hearing the news, the workers throughout the factory were outraged and unanimously went on strike yesterday morning, raising seven demands: (1) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike. (2) Members should not be dismissed without reason; the union must be notified before a member is dismissed. (3) Wages should not be reduced. (4) Workers should not be oppressed without reason. (5) The factory must distribute work evenly. (6) Membership in the union should not be a condition for employment. (7) Yu Kunru, the factory's lackey who reduces wages and undermines the labor movement, should be expelled from the factory. The strike will not end until these demands are met. The union has reported the strike situation to the Party and government organs yesterday and requested immediate mediation.</p>

<p>It was decided to meet again this morning to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>After the British-owned Jardine Matheson Tugboat Company dismissed a large number of Chinese workers, all the Chinese workers rose up in opposition and petitioned the Party and government organs for mediation to maintain their livelihood. At 1 PM yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau sent mediator Zhu Guilin, and the Municipal Party Headquarters sent cadre Ku Weixiong to jointly seek solutions. The company stated that the reason for dismissing 44 dockworkers in various locations was due to sluggish business, and they agreed to pay each worker half a month's wage as severance pay. As for the ten boats, including Nos. 24, and 47 workers, it was a job transfer. After negotiations by the Party and government organs, it was decided to meet again this morning to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>The National Government Appointed Xu Peigen as a Representative to Accept Five Aircraft</h3>

<p>The Ministry of Finance and eight banks including the Shanghai Central Bank and the Bank of China negotiated to establish a new loan totaling 12 million yuan to deal with urgent relief for the Yellow River flood. It is secured by customs duties. The New Voice News Agency has learned the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Total Loan Amount</h3>
<p>After returning to China at the end of last month, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, in view of the severity of the Yellow River flood, with breaches in Shandong and Henan provinces, and millions of victims in the affected areas in dire need of food, should immediately allocate funds for relief. While in Shanghai, he negotiated with the banking sector in Shanghai to borrow money to deal with urgent relief for the Yellow River flood, the total amount of which is 12 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Eight Banks Underwrite</h3>
<p>The underwriting banks for the Yellow River flood urgent relief loan are the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China South Bank, Yanye Bank, Jincheng Bank, Dalu Bank, and Siming Bank. The underwriting methods are divided into three types: 2 million yuan, 1 million yuan, and 500,000 yuan, which are underwritten by the eight banks separately.</p>

<p>The collateral for this new loan is monthly appropriation of funds from the customs duty revenue to be repaid within one year. Minister Song has already reached an agreement with the banking sector in Shanghai yesterday, and a formal contract will be signed in Shanghai. The rumor of 15 million yuan is actually a mistake for 12 million yuan.</p>

<p>The shipyard specially prepared a small launch, the Victoria, at 1:15 PM to welcome guests at the new customs wharf. When they arrived at the shipyard, it was already 1 PM. The bottle-breaker was originally Mrs. Kung Hsiang-hsi (Soong Ai-ling), but Mrs. Kung was unable to attend due to an engagement and was replaced by her daughter, Miss Rosamond Kung. At 2:30 PM, all preparations were in place. Miss Kung held flowers in her left hand and the bottle in her right hand. After the electric bell rang, she aimed the bottle at the bow of the ship and threw it with force. With a loud crash, champagne splashed everywhere, and the ship slid into the Huangpu River amidst the cheers of the crowd. The Jiangnan tugboat towed it to the dock, and the ceremony was declared complete.</p>
<h3>Refreshments</h3>
<p>After the launching, all the guests took the small launch back to the shipyard dock and landed. They went to the auditorium for refreshments (however, Mr. T. L. Soong and Miss Kung had already returned to their residences). There were many guests, and they gathered together. Inspector General of Customs Mr. F. W. Maze and Section Chief Yu Jianfu of the shipyard went to another room and drank champagne together.</p>
<h3>Shipyard Director's Speech</h3>
<p>During the banquet, Deputy Director Chen Zaofan, representing Minister Chen Shaokuan, stood up and gave a speech, saying: "Today is the day of the launching of the Dexing Customs patrol ship, which was built by this shipyard. We are honored to have Mrs. Kung come to break the bottle, and we are also honored to have Inspector General of Customs Mr. Maze and gentlemen from all walks of life come to visit the ceremony. It is a great event, and we are very grateful. The Customs is not only the sole agency for the country to collect taxes, but also bears the important mission of investigating criminals, patrolling for bandits, and preventing smuggling. Now, Finance Minister Song, during this construction period, believes that the Customs' existing patrol ships are not sufficient for dispatch, and specially ordered the addition of many new patrol ships of various sizes. Because this shipyard is a national shipyard, it is highly trusted, and most of the new ships have been entrusted to this shipyard for construction. The Dexing patrol ship is one of the largest of these new ships. This shipyard has a long history of shipbuilding, and all its projects have always been praised by all sectors of society. In the future, we will continue to strive for excellence, so that all the new ships built for the Customs can assist the Customs, enhance its work, and increase its reputation, in order to live up to Minister Song's expectations. I also hope that all patriotic gentlemen in our country will follow Minister Song's trust in this shipyard and support and guide this shipyard. It is the good fortune of this shipyard and the glory of our country. Now that the autumn heat has not yet subsided, I dare not say more. I respectfully give this brief report and wish all the guests a long life for the Customs of the Republic of China and a long life for the Dexing patrol ship!" Then, Mr. Rickchard of the Customs gave a reply.</p>
<h3>Overall Ship Structure</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the shipyard, the Customs has built ten new patrol ships in this shipyard, and the Dexing ship is the first of these new ships. It is 170 feet long, 32 feet wide, 160 feet from the top of the mast to the bottom of the mast, 16 feet 6 inches deep, 11 feet 6 inches draft, 13 nautical miles per hour, and the displacement is 700 tons.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Silk Factory Decide to Resume Work Today</h3>
<p>The production quota system will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Female workers at silk factories in Shanghai opposed to the implementation of the production quota system went on strike at 20 factories in the Zhabei Xinzha District, including Baotai. Through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it was decided that the production quota system would be temporarily suspended, and workers at all factories will resume work tomorrow morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Continuing the Strike</h3>
<p>Workers at twenty silk factories in the Zhabei Xinzha District on Changan Road, including Yuanxin Hongsheng, Xiexin, Baotai Fuxing, Chuxin, Maofeng, Hongchun Qianyuan Zhenxing Yuji, Jiyu Xieji, Hengfeng Road Meifeng, Yuanfeng Yonghe Road Jiyu Guangfu Road Wuxing, Jiatai Guangzhao Road Yuanxing Yuanji, and other factories, have been on strike since the 1st of this month, one after another, to oppose the implementation of the production quota system by the employers. The previous day, after the union advised them to resume work, the workers believed that there was still no solution, so they went on strike again after resuming work. Yesterday, the workers at each factory did not increase.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Mediation</h3>
<p>Because the Social Affairs Bureau feared that the dispute would spread, it convened both parties for mediation at the bureau at 1 PM yesterday. Shen Huachen and Xu Peirong of the Silk Industry Association, Cui Ahui and Yang Shu of the Third District Silk Spinning Union, Yuan Yunlong and Yang Gengti of the Fourth District Union, and Chen Xiupu and Le Xiaoying of the Sixth District Union attended. Wang Xianqing, a staff member of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided over the meeting, and Lu Yinchu, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, attended.</p>
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>First, the chairman inquired about the opinions of both parties, and then summarized the opinions of labor and management. The following resolutions were made: (1) The issue of the production quota system will be the responsibility of the Industry Association to notify all factories to temporarily suspend its implementation. (2) The Industry Association will formulate detailed measures for the production quota system and submit them to the Party and government organs for review and approval. (3) Tomorrow morning (i.e., today), the union will be responsible for advising all workers to return to work in the factory. At that time, both labor and management were satisfied and signed the agreement to resolve the dispute.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday ordered the Silk Industry Association to comply. After investigating that various factories in the industry have reformed the wage system, the content and detailed measures of the production quota system have not been reported for review and approval in advance, and it was implemented on September 1st, which is inappropriate. In addition to ordering the union to advise workers to resume work on a specific date, it is hereby ordered to comply and quickly submit detailed measures for the production quota system for review and approval, and immediately instruct all factories to temporarily suspend its implementation. Do not violate this order.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Work by a Specific Date</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday ordered the Silk Spinning Industry Association of the Fourth and Sixth Districts to comply. After investigating that the Industry Association of the industry has rashly announced the implementation of the production quota system measures without approval, it is certainly inappropriate. However, the workers' hasty strike is also not justified. In addition to ordering the Industry Association of the industry to quickly submit detailed measures for the production quota system for review and approval, and immediately instruct all factories to temporarily suspend its implementation, it is hereby ordered to comply, and immediately instruct all workers to resume work by a specific date. Do not violate this order.</p>
<h3>Union Notice</h3>
<p>The Sixth District Silk Spinning Union issued a notice to all workers to resume work. The original text reads:</p>
<h3>No Lockouts, Strikes, or Dismissals During Mediation and Arbitration</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Reaffirms the Prohibition</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government, in accordance with the provisions of the amended Labor Dispute Handling Law, stipulates that no lockouts or strikes shall occur during the mediation or arbitration period. Recently, employers at the British American Tobacco Company dismissed workers during the mediation period of the dispute, and the workers also went on strike, believing that it was contrary to government orders. Therefore, it issued a clear notice and reaffirmed the prohibition. The original notice reads: Shanghai Municipal Government Notice No. 103, regarding the notice, in accordance with Article 36 of the amended Labor Dispute Handling Law, employers or workers of each enterprise shall not suspend business or strike due to any labor dispute. Employers or workers of other industries or businesses whose disputes are in the mediation period or have been submitted to arbitration shall not suspend business or strike. Employers shall not dismiss workers during the mediation or arbitration period. The starting date of the mediation or arbitration period shall be calculated from the date on which the competent administrative agency notifies the parties to the dispute. Article 37 stipulates that workers or workers' organizations shall not engage in the following acts: 1. Closing shops or factories; 2. Taking or destroying goods or equipment of shops or factories without permission; 3. Forcing others to strike, etc. The restrictions on the actions of parties to labor disputes were announced by this government on July 5, 1929. Unexpectedly, recently, disputes have occurred between workers and employers, and there are still cases of going on strike or suspending business without following the legal procedures, or even destroying goods and equipment, as well as dismissing workers without authorization. This kind of behavior is both a violation of the law and a hindrance to order, and it is urgent to reaffirm the prohibition. In addition to ordering the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus, this notice is hereby re-issued for public information. If a dispute occurs between labor and management, you should immediately submit it to the competent authority for handling in accordance with the amended Labor Dispute Handling Law, and there shall be no violation of the restrictions on the above-mentioned actions. If anyone dares to violate this, this government will investigate and deal with it according to law without leniency. Sincerely, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of the Republic of China, September 5, 1932.</p>

Please vote to decide. It was decided to set the opening date as September 15th.

<p>Notice is hereby given that the factories in Xinzha District of this district have arbitrarily changed to the production quota system, which has caused dissatisfaction among the workers and a strike has been declared. This association has requested the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to handle it impartially. Yesterday, the Party and government organs convened both labor and management parties for formal mediation and have decided that the production quota system will not be implemented temporarily and that all workers will resume work from today. This notice is hereby issued for compliance.</p>
<h3>Association Notice</h3>
<p>The Silk Industry Association stated that the case has now been resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau, ordering both labor and management to resume work this morning. Xu Peirong and others were sent to notify each factory at 4:20 PM yesterday to start the machines at 5:45 AM today to await the workers' return to work. At the same time, the Industry Association stated that the production quota system has been ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to be formulated in detail and submitted for review, so it was decided to convene a general meeting of representatives to discuss specific measures in order to submit them to the Party and government organs for approval.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Arbitration Decision on British American Tobacco Company Wage Reduction Dispute</h3>
<p>To be officially announced today.</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that after the British American Tobacco Company workers accepted the authorities' advice and resumed work on September 5, the Shanghai Municipal Government continued to arbitrate all the unpaid wages for the first half of the year yesterday and decided that the municipal government would officially announce it today. The union expressed its gratitude to all parties for the resolution of the dispute. The new factory printing workers specifically published a notice denying that Pan Quanrong and others had falsely withdrawn from the union. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Today's Announcement</h3>
<p>Regarding the unresolved wage dispute from the May strike at the Anglo-American Factory (Plant 1132), the Municipal Government submitted the matter to arbitration. A meeting was held the previous day, and due to time constraints, arbitration continued at 11:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included: Commissioner Wang Yanyun from the Party Headquarters, Commissioner Cha Liangjian from the Court (First Special District Court), Pang Shangrong from the District Court, Commissioner Wang Xiaolai from the Investor side (Municipal Chamber of Commerce), Commissioner Lu Keming from the Labor side (Postal Workers Union), and Municipal Government Chairman Luo Panhui. The arbitration concluded at 11:00 AM at noon. However, as the arbitration results required further organization, the Municipal Government decided to formally announce them today.</p>
<h3>Denial of Withdrawal from Union</h3>
<p>Representatives from various departments of the New Factory Printing Section</p>
<p>Regarding Pan Quanrong and others presumptuously using the names of workers in the printing department to publish a notice of withdrawal from the union, they hereby issue a statement: "We are extremely displeased with the announcement in various newspapers on the 3rd of this month regarding the workers of the Pudong Anglo-American Tobacco Factory's printing department withdrawing from the union. The elected directors of the union can indeed restrain and lead the workers, and work for the true welfare of the workers. Not only is this what our department's workers have always believed, but all 8,000 workers obey the leadership and wholeheartedly support it. This time, the factory unjustifiably dismissed worker number 938 from the department head's workshop and worker number 46 from the old factory, violating government orders, undermining labor conditions, and depriving workers of their benefits. The dispute has been prolonged and unresolved. All the workers, unable to endure it any longer, unanimously engaged in a work slowdown to prompt the factory to realize its mistake. Anyone with a sense of humanity would feel the same. However, some unethical individuals from our department, such as Pan Quanrong, Xu Wenqing, Chen Sihong, and Zhang Xiqi, were exploited by the factory to deceive and confuse workers, fabricate false information, coerce a return to work, and disrupt the work slowdown order, inciting universal public outrage. They even gathered a crowd of hooligans to disrupt the union, demonstrating extreme depravity and madness. This has caused our department's workers to be spat upon and cursed by all the workers, leaving an indelible stain on the labor movement. Fortunately, the union was able to maintain order, and their treacherous scheme was thwarted. Now, these driven dogs, Pan Quanrong and others, are again using the names of workers and issuing irresponsible announcements to slander the union, hoping to spread rumors and mislead the public. Upon hearing this, we feel deep indignation. Now, during this turbulent time for labor and management, our department's workers rely entirely on the union's leadership to seek liberation. We are determined not to associate with Pan Quanrong and others, and will not withdraw from the union and lose our safeguards. Besides firmly supporting the union, we hereby issue this statement."</p>
<h3>To All</h3>
<p>To All Sectors: We, the workers of this association, have been subjected to various forms of oppression from the factory, leading to a work slowdown. Through the tireless mediation of Party and government agencies, worker number 46, Lao Ye, who was dismissed, has been allowed to return to work. Regarding wages during the work slowdown, the old factory will provide 70% of the wages, and the new factory will provide 50%. All the workers have followed the instructions of the Municipal Government and the advice of representatives from the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, and returned to work at 5 PM. The unresolved parts, such as the full payment of wages during the work slowdown at the new factory, and the reinstatement of worker number 938 at the new printing factory, are awaiting continued mediation by Party and government agencies. However, during the work slowdown, we received support and assistance from various labor unions and organizations, who either sent telegrams of support or dispatched personnel to express their condolences. Their righteousness reached the skies. However, as the unrest was difficult to quell and there were many disputes, we have been too busy to express our gratitude individually. We hereby use these few words to express our sincere appreciation. We hope that you will take this into consideration. Respectfully, Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Workers Union.</p>
<h3>Yan Qingxiang Discusses Attending Three International Conferences</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Mr. Yan Qingxiang, the investor representative of China to the 17th International Labour Conference, was ordered to travel abroad in early April and has made great contributions at the conference. After the conference closed, he went to the Czech Republic, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway, and other countries to attend the World Cotton Conference and the World Power Conference. His tasks have now been completed. He arrived in Shanghai on the Conte Verde yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Yan yesterday to inquire about his trip, and he provided the following answers:</p>
<h3>International Labour Conference</h3>
<p>The International Labour Conference was held in Geneva from June 8th, with representatives from various countries participating. In addition to Yan Qingxiang, the Chinese delegation included Ji Yongxiang, the labor representative, and Xiao Jizhou, the government representative, as well as a Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in France. The conference opened on June 8th and did not close until the end of June. The conference period was very long, so there were many cases discussed. The proposals that were more closely related to China included: (1) the implementation of labor factory law; (2) equal treatment for foreign workers and local workers. These two proposals were put forward by China. The second proposal was also put forward by the Indian representative, but the results of the discussions were not passed, which was a pity. Because I still had to attend the World Power Conference, I left for Japan on the 24th without waiting for the case to close. All the conference affairs were left to the interim representative.</p>
<h3>World Power Conference</h3>
<p>The World Power Conference held its opening ceremony in Copenhagen, Denmark on June 26. Mr. Yan left Geneva on the 24th to rush to participate, and the day after the opening, he and representatives from various countries rushed to Kyoto, Switzerland to hold a formal meeting. On July 17, he went to the capital of Norway to hold the closing ceremony of the conference. Many cases were discussed at this conference. The general idea of each case was how to use natural forces to drive machines, such as the use of water power. In short, the conference was completely a technical conference.</p>
<h3>World Cotton Conference</h3>
<p>After the World Power Conference, Mr. Yan rushed to Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, to attend the World Cotton Conference, as a representative of the National Yarn Industry Association. The conference period was short, and the cases discussed were all about various important issues related to the cotton yarn industry. One of the proposals was about the fraud that often occurs during the packing of American cotton, such as using inferior goods as silk goods, etc. How should such fraud be prevented in the future so that it can be eradicated? Mr. Yan continued by saying that after completing his official duties, he traveled to various places for inspection. All the documents are still en route because he returned to the country early. Once they arrive, he will sort them out and then go to Beijing to report on his mission.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Turns Over Airplane Funds Raised from Shanghai Businesses</h3>
<p>A Total of Over 90,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the China Aviation Association yesterday, enclosing funds raised from Shanghai businesses for the purchase of airplanes: "We have been raising funds from Shanghai businesses for the purchase of airplanes. We previously received a letter from your association's Shanghai Recruitment Headquarters stating that the purchased airplanes had arrived in Shanghai and that the price of the airplanes must be paid. The funds raised should be remitted as soon as possible." We have already replied to this letter. In total, we have raised $53,855.64, plus interest of $640.22. After deducting expenses for printing and advertising, totaling $1,047.28, the total remaining is $92,448.58. We have attached a detailed list of the donations. We are sending a bank check for $51,448.69 along with the letter. Please acknowledge receipt of the donation and issue a receipt to complete the procedures. We are deeply grateful. Sincerely, China Aviation Association."</p>

<h3>A Shocking and Unheard-of Theft Case on the New Ning Shao Steamer</h3>
<p>70,000 Yuan Escorted from the Ningbo Branch of the Kenye Bank to Shanghai, Only to Find Over 69,000 Yuan Stolen | A Five-Inch Square Hole Drilled in the Bottom of the Box</p>
<p>The Ningbo branch of the China Kenye Bank entrusted Wei Yuming, a steward of the New Ning Shao Steamer No. 22, with 70,000 yuan in banknotes packed in an iron box along with a passport from the Ministry of Finance, to be sent to Shanghai on the 5th of this month. However, when the steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, a five-inch square hole was discovered drilled in the bottom of the box, and 69,790 yuan of the stored banknotes had been stolen, leaving only over 200 yuan and the passport from the Ministry of Finance, etc. Shocked, steward Wei Yuming immediately reported to the Shanghai branch, which in turn reported to the Public Security Bureau, all police stations, and local police agencies, requesting a joint effort to investigate. The bank's legal advisor, lawyer Wu Linkun, also represented the bank in placing a reward advertisement, stating that anyone who can capture the perpetrators and recover the stolen goods, or provide information leading to the resolution of the case, will be rewarded with half of the recovered stolen goods. Last night, a reporter met with a senior official of the Kenye Bank, who said that whenever the Ningbo branch had funds to be sent to Shanghai, they were mostly entrusted to Wei Yuming, a steward of the New Ning Shao Steamer No. 22. This was because Wei's credit was outstanding and his family was quite wealthy. Moreover, his guarantor was also a prominent figure in the business community. Therefore, after the case occurred, there was no suspicion of Wei. The thieves in this case were exceptionally skilled. The theft of such a large sum of money was premeditated. When the steamer set sail from Ningbo, the thieves openly boarded the ship disguised as passengers. There were two of them in total. One of them was disguised as a servant and carried very simple luggage. After boarding the ship, the thief occupied a cabin alone and dressed and behaved in an extremely lavish manner. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, the two thieves leisurely tidied up their belongings and then went ashore. At that time, a steward on the ship was cleaning the cabins as usual. When he reached the iron box containing the banknotes, he suddenly found several things in the corner: iron chisels and scissors. While he was suspicious, he also picked up several pieces of iron. Upon closer inspection, they were the same color as the iron on the box. He quickly told Wei Yuming. When Wei rushed to check, he saw a hole in the bottom of the box. Upon inspecting the box, it was empty. There were many broken ropes used to tie the banknotes on the ground. The thieves had made the hole in the bottom of the box very small, and all the banknotes were in bundles of one thousand yuan, which were larger than the hole. Therefore, the thieves used scissors to cut the ropes tying the banknotes and slowly pulled them out one by one. At that time, Wei was almost out of his mind and reported to the comprador, and then urgently reported to the Shanghai branch. This is the whole story of the case. He added that the 70,000 yuan was the recent repayment of funds from Ningbo merchants. There were banknotes from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks. Whether the case can be solved and the stolen goods recovered in the near future depends entirely on the efforts of the police.</p>
<h3>An Interview with the Anti-Japanese Hero Jiang Minsheng</h3>
<p>Unable to hold back tears when talking about his life experience | Polishing shoes while not forgetting to provide relief to the Northeast</p>
<p>Jiang Minsheng, an anti-Japanese hero and former major general, is struggling to make a living by relying on his own efforts. Since the failure of the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast, he feels ashamed of the people and the country. Since coming to Shanghai, he has humbled himself and taken on a lowly job, polishing shoes for people at the entrance of the Laidefang alley opposite the Cathay Theater on Avenue Joffre. The reporter, after hearing people talking about it, made a special visit to his workplace. Jiang Jun, who appeared to be about thirty years old, with a strong physique, was bending over polishing a person's leather shoes. His clothing was very untidy, and the shoes he was wearing were extremely worn. The reporter waited quietly for him to finish his work, then shook his hand and asked him questions. His speech was extremely passionate and intense. According to him, he felt heartbroken when he saw that the famous anti-Japanese heroes who came to Nanjing and Shanghai mostly lived in tall buildings, had plenty of food and clothing, and had many attendants. They traveled by car, sometimes to Moganshan, sometimes to Suzhou and Hangzhou, and their behavior was lavish. He himself had been fighting the Japanese invaders in Harbin for twenty years since the age of sixteen, and had now failed. He should have killed himself to apologize to the people, but then realized that as long as he lived for one day, he should fight for one day. The people of the Northeast are still waiting for us to return quickly and plan for a good opportunity to wait for another action. Therefore, he has endured the humiliation of doing this job to temporarily maintain his life. He participated in the major battles of Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, and Ding Chao. Although he has made some small contributions, it is difficult to compensate for the crime of losing territory. On April 26th last year, he was captured by the Japanese and released on May 14th. He came to Shanghai once, but did not dare to disturb all sectors and hurriedly returned to Jilin. He also participated in several major battles. The people of the Northeast still have great faith in the generals, with Wang Yizhe of the 67th Army, the volunteer army Wang Delin, Deng TieMei, and the former Jilin Chairman Cheng Yun being the most respected. In the future, he can cooperate with them to seek the restoration of lost territory, and only such people are qualified. When he came to Shanghai, he joined the Northeast Refugee Reception Center as a refugee from the Northeast. Fortunately, he was taken in, but he could not bear to sit and eat, so he personally took up this job. He has heard that foreign university professors and university students do not object to low-level occupations, so who is he to feel ashamed of it? However, recently his life has been severely bullied by imperialists, which is especially painful to his heart, because his workplace is often interfered with by patrolmen. After speaking, he couldn't help but shed tears, and the reporter also felt sad. It was also said that he had been repeatedly visited by philanthropists and industrialists, who asked him to go and live a better life, but he absolutely refused because he felt ashamed to accept it. At this point, a certain shoe factory sent shoe straps to meet Jiang Jun's professional needs. Jiang Jun repeatedly declined, and the sender left them anyway. 抗日英雄江民聲君（龔叔賢攝） "Anti-Japanese Hero Jiang Minsheng (Photo by Gong Shuxian)"</p>
<p>He had no choice but to temporarily accept them. It was said that Jiang Jun would sell them and donate the proceeds to the Refugee Relief Association. The reporter then asked about his daily income, which was about two or three yuan. The most common was 20 to 40 cents each time, and the most was one or two yuan. Jiang Jun, after deducting the minimum necessary for living, still sends all the money to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association. He currently lives in the refugee reception center at No. 25 Caishou Lane, Julida Road. His daily working hours are from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM. Many people from all walks of life visit him. During the conversation, he often talked about his past and future in great detail.</p>
<h3>Inheritance Dispute After Liu Xiji's Death</h3>
<p>One Wife and Two Concubines Jointly Accuse the Eldest Son of Concealing Deeds in an Attempt to Embezzle the Estate</p>
<p>Liu Xiji, the general manager of the New World Company, passed away on June 10th of last year. During his lifetime, Liu first married Ms. Huang, who gave birth to a son named Miaosan, 23 years old, who currently resides at No. 82 Yongfeng Lane, North Sichuan Road. However, Ms. Huang died many years ago, and he then remarried Ms. Peng Yuezhen as his second wife. Later, he also took Ms. Xu Keqin and Ms. Qian Dingbao as concubines. Ms. Peng had no children. Ms. Xu gave birth to three sons and one daughter: Miaofang, 7 years old; Miaozhong, 3 years old; Miaofen, 2 years old; and Miaorong, 9 years old. Ms. Qian gave birth to two sons and one daughter: Miaoguang, 6 years old; Miaokun, 4 years old; and Miaoling, 7 years old. Liu Xiji also left a will before his death, dividing all his property into fifteen shares, with Peng Yuezhen and Liu Miaosan each receiving two shares. The remaining two concubines, five sons, and two daughters each received one share. One share was reserved for the public, and one share was specifically reserved for the future eldest grandson. Because his wives and children were mostly young, he entrusted his friend Li Minzhou to be the estate guardian and handed over all the estate to Li for management until the youngest child reached the age of 21. At that time, Liu Miaosan and others unanimously respected the deceased's wishes and followed the instructions. While handing over the property, they also recommended Liu Miaosan to entrust lawyer Yang Guoshu to submit a request to the First Special District District Court for the issuance of a certificate, allowing the guardian Li Minzhou to perform his custodial duties. While this was in progress, one wife and two concubines of Liu suddenly discovered that their husband had also purchased a piece of land in Yancang, Henan Province, Guangzhou, totaling 70 wells. Because they did not know where the ownership documents were stored, they still entrusted lawyer Yang to submit a request to the special court to temporarily postpone the announcement, and continued to investigate the whereabouts of the documents. They also invited Li Minzhou to hold a family meeting and decided to divide the land into four shares, with one wife, two concubines, and Liu's eldest son Miaosan each receiving one share. They then urged Miaosan to hand over the deeds he held, but Miaosan kept delaying. He originally lived with his stepmother, but because of this dispute, he moved to Yongfeng Lane on North Sichuan Road to avoid her, which further increased their animosity. Now, Peng Yuezhen, in conjunction with the two concubines, has hired lawyer Yang to file a lawsuit against Liu Miaosan, accusing him of concealing deeds in an attempt to embezzle the estate, requesting the court to expedite the case and order the defendant to hand over the deeds</p>
<h3>The Engineering Department of the Economic Council Expedites the Formulation of Construction Plans for the Yellow River Disaster Area</h3>
<p>Xi Dejiong Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Immediately Dispatched Personnel | Wu Shilin Reports on the Inspection of the Henan River Project</p>
<p>Mr. Xi Dejiong, Director of the Engineering Department of the National Economic Council, was recently summoned to Beijing by Chairman Song of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee to plan construction projects in the disaster area downstream of the Yellow River. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Mr. Wu Shilin, an engineer previously dispatched by the Council to inspect the flood situation in Henan and Luoyang, and the projects organized by the Henan Provincial Works Bureau, also returned to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Xi and Mr. Wu at the Engineering Department of the Economic Council yesterday to inquire about the river disaster and the inspection situation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mr. Xi's Remarks</h3>
<p>According to Xi Dejiong, the report that he would take a plane to inspect the flood situation in the disaster area downstream of the Yellow River has been canceled. The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee has already received inspection reports from various provinces and water conservancy associations, and the situation is already clear. There is no need for him to go again, and there are many construction plans that need to be formulated urgently, so it is difficult to split himself. The zoning survey will be carried out by personnel dispatched by the Engineering Department, who will depart tomorrow or the day after. When Chairman Song of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee went to Lushan, he entrusted Standing Committee Member Liu Ruiheng to preside over the meeting. Yesterday (i.e., the 5th) a Standing Committee meeting was held, and initial decisions were made on relief for various industries. After he returns to Shanghai, he will plan and draft a construction plan for the disaster area within a few days. After Chairman Song returns from Lushan, it can be reviewed and implemented.</p>
<h3>Inspection Report</h3>
<p>According to Wu Shilin, he was ordered to go to Henan from Hankou at the beginning of last month for inspection, and only returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his duties. This year's Yellow River floods came very quickly. The water level in Mengjin and other places was highest on August 8th and 9th. Subsequently, due to multiple breaches in Lanfeng downstream and Hebei Province, the water flow accelerated, and the water level dropped by more than six meters in two days, and the riverbed was scoured to a depth of more than four meters. This water level and scouring situation were measured in Mengjin. The situation is similar in Kaifeng and other places. Therefore, in the current situation, the river channel has turned out to be better than before the flood. Because the riverbed has been scoured deeper and the water level has returned to the channel, the risk of horizontal overflow can be reduced. Although the levee at Zhuzui Ridge Ding Dam was damaged in Berniu Village, Guangwu Mausoleum, and Tiexie Town, and the water flow was forced into the south bank, there are fortunately 27 old dikes of various sizes for protection, so there is no immediate danger. Other places, such as Heijiang Estuary, have water seeping into the dike body, and the situation is very dangerous. With the careful protection of the Henan Provincial River Affairs Bureau and the Henan Provincial Works Bureau of our department, if the water does not rise again, it should not be in danger of breaking again. The Yellow River breaches this time were all caused by insufficient dike height. The water level along the river during this summer flood was almost the highest ever recorded in the same month in the past hundred years. The dike body was able to be preserved because the dikes were three or four feet to seven or eight feet above the water surface. The remaining people were spared from suffering another disaster. If there had been no dike construction work and this year's repairs, the overflow and collapse of the dikes along the river would have been even more harmful than in the Yellow River Basin. From this, we know that it is a matter of human effort, and it cannot be abandoned due to the difficulty of construction and lack of funds. and put Li Minzhou in charge as a guardian, so as to comply with the original intention of her late husband's will, etc." The First Special District Court opened a hearing, but because the defendant did not appear, it was postponed until yesterday morning for trial. However, the defendant still did not return from Shanghai and was unable to appear. Only the plaintiff's attorney appeared in court and made a statement. Judge Mo Runhua ordered a change of date for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Central Police Station Arrests Wanted Criminal in Kidnapping Case</h3>

<h3>A Poor Private Tutor is Suddenly Assassinated</h3>
<p>Nine Cuts All Over His Body, Intestines Flowing Out, Blood Gushing Like a Fountain | The Reason for the Murder is Said to Be Unlike a Revenge Killing, but Close to a Case of Adultery</p>
<p>At 0:30 AM yesterday morning, an assassination occurred in the jurisdiction of the Zhabei Fourth District Police Station, in the Sujia Lane area of ​​Tanjiaqiao. The victim was a poor private tutor. The following is a record of the investigation findings:</p>
<h3>Impoverished Private Tutor</h3>
<p>Chu Zhongfu, a native of Taixian, Jiangbei, was 39 years old. He was somewhat educated and had some knowledge of medicine. It is reported that he had married and had several children in his hometown. Some years ago, they suddenly had disagreements and separated. Chu came to Shanghai alone, but with nothing to his name, it was difficult to gain a foothold. Relying on his knowledge, he set up a fortune-telling stall at the empty space in Sujia Lane, Tanjiaqiao, at the end of Datong Road, relying on his silver tongue to tell fortunes for a group of superstitious people. Although it was not a bustling business, the income was enough to make a living. At the same time, the neighbors saw that Chu was composed and seemed to be a pitiful scholar in decline, so they encouraged Chu to set up a school to teach children. Chu was moved by this, and</p>
<h3>Pitifully Poor</h3>
<p>He borrowed a spare room from Qian Daoren (whose name is Yuqin), a native of Yancheng, who was over fifty years old, as a place to teach and live. There were also more than 20 children from poor families nearby who were eager to study. At the same time, Chu also treated people's illnesses and vaccinated children, so although he could not live a life of luxury for the past three years, he had no worries about food and clothing. Chu was also very friendly with Qian. It is reported that Chu had therefore worshiped Qian Yuqin as his teacher, and he was a vegetarian, worshiped Buddha, and chanted scriptures incessantly. However, his bed consisted of only two pieces of wood. Apart from that, he had nothing of value, yet he was still coveted by thieves. One night, while Chu was away, they stole it. Since then, Chu no longer prepared a bed. At night, he only used three long benches to make a temporary bed.</p>
<h3>Sudden Tragic Death</h3>
<p>The night before last (the 4th), Chu went out again and didn't return until 7 AM on the 5th. That same day, in the afternoon at 4 PM, he went out again and returned home at 8 PM in the evening, looking resentful. He immediately took a small stool and sat outside to cool off, not exchanging a single word with anyone. Shortly after, he went to bed. Who would have known that around 12:30 AM last night, Xiao, the 48-year-old wife of Qian Yuqin, was fast asleep when she suddenly heard loud barking outside. At the same time, there was also noise coming from where Chu was sleeping. Thinking that a thief had come again, Xiao hurriedly got dressed and went to check. She saw the door wide open and the dogs barking madly. She looked around but found nothing. When she turned back into the house, she saw that the door to Chu's bedroom was also open. She called out to him but got no response, so she hurried inside to check. She found Chu dead on his makeshift bed, with blood flowing freely and splattered all over the floor.</p>
<h3>A Total of Nine Cuts</h3>
<p>Xiao was greatly shocked by the sight and ran into her husband's bedroom, urgently waking Qian Yuqin. Together, they went out to investigate and saw Chu wearing a white undershirt and naked from the waist down, without pants. His intestines were also spilling out of his abdomen, making for a very gruesome scene. They quickly reported the incident to the Tan Jiaqiao Fourth District Police Station. Ge, the patrol chief of the station, and others went to investigate. At the same time, Xu Weijiang was dispatched by the Fourth District Headquarters to investigate. It was discovered that the deceased had been cut a total of nine times: three cuts to the head, one to the face, two to the left and right sides of the neck, one to the abdomen, one to the chest, and one to the right hand. The middle finger was severed, and the intestines were spilling out. Because the cuts to both sides of the neck were very deep, the head was almost severed. After learning of the circumstances of the death, the officers returned to the station to report. On one hand, they instructed the local bailiff to request an autopsy from the regional court. On the other hand, they summoned Qian Yuqin and his wife to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Speculations on the Cause</h3>
<p>According to Xiao's statement at the Fourth District Police Station, the deceased had been staying out overnight because he had a mistress. When asked how she knew, she hesitated and did not answer. At the same time, neighbors also reported to the police station that Xiao was highly suspected in this case. Therefore, the police station temporarily detained Xiao and ordered all subordinates to search for the murderer and bring them to justice. It was also learned that the deceased had an older brother and sister-in-law in his hometown, and neighbors had been notified to come to Shanghai to take care of the aftermath. As for the truth of the case, onlookers speculate that it was not a revenge killing but rather related to an affair.</p>
<h3>20,000 Yuan in Education Expenses for Yang Quan's Orphans</h3>
<p>Approved by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Yang Quan, the Director-General of the National Central Research Institute, was assassinated on the morning of the 18th of last month in front of the Institute on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. After receiving a report from Cai Yuanpei, the president of the Institute, the National Government's Executive Yuan immediately sent telegrams to the military and police authorities in the city, ordering them to quickly arrest the murderer and deal with the matter severely. Now it is known that the Executive Yuan, based on the request of Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, and others, to provide 20,000 yuan in education expenses for Yang's orphans, has approved the request.</p>
<h3>Special Court in Tianjin for Shanghai Kidnappers</h3>
<p>A total of nine kidnapping cases, seven in Shanghai and two in Tianjin</p>
<p>Jin Jiulin, the Inspector-General of the Special Agency of the First Detective Group of the French Police, along with Chief Detective Zhang Ziying, Deputy Detective Zhou Bingcheng, Detectives Cui Zhenduo, Qin Youyu, and others, previously arrested twelve men and women, including the major kidnappers Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, and Geng Huatang, in Tianjin and brought them to Shanghai. It was found that they had kidnapped Huang Yuyi, the deputy manager of the Zhongnan Bank; Chen Yanghe, the deputy manager of the Siming Bank; He Shaoting, the foreman of Xinsenji; Gu Zelin, the son of Yunnan division commander Gu Zizhen; Huang Baohua, and others in Shanghai. They also strangled Little Shaoxing on Avenue Petain and kidnapped Chen Zhuling and Liang Huiwu, the compradors of Jardine Matheson, in Tianjin, disposing of the bodies by burying them to eliminate the evidence. The details of the investigation and detention by the Second Special District Court have been reported in previous newspapers. During the investigation, the police also found that Cao Ziqing and Li Youren, two people who had been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment in the Public Concession, were related to the case and sent detectives to bring them to court and merge the cases for investigation. The investigation has now been completed. Yesterday afternoon, the court held a special session to formally begin the trial of this case. At 2 PM, the police sent the detectives in charge of the case to escort the defendants to court. The lawyers retained by the defendants, Wang Shizong, Hua Maosheng, Zhu Dianqing, E Sen, Zhan Jifeng, Jin Yu, and others, arrived at the court one after another to await instructions. When the bell rang three times, Judge Li Changnian, accompanied by Clerk Wang Baoxun, took the bench in the first courtroom to conduct the trial. The victims were not present. The bailiffs first brought the defendants to the court, and the judge asked for their names and ordered them to stand in order. After that, the police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stood up and presented the case, stating that the defendants were arrested by the police in Tianjin for kidnapping and brought to Shanghai, where they were detained and investigated by the court. It has been found that the first defendant, Zheng Tangsheng, the second defendant, Shang Zhen, the fifth defendant, Liu Yimin, the sixth defendant, Wu Shaoting, the tenth defendant, Geng Huatang, and the eleventh defendant, Li Yueshan, each committed crimes related to the kidnapping cases, either jointly or independently. There were a total of nine cases, two in Tianjin and seven in Shanghai. In the first case, on August 13, 1928, the police found a Liu surname hostage in a house at 755 Haig Road and arrested Li A'er, who confessed that Geng Tang instigated the kidnapping. Geng was not arrested at that time and was wanted. He has now been arrested. In the second case, on August 30, 1929, Liu Yimin and others kidnapped Chen Zhuling, the comprador of Jardine Matheson, in Tianjin and detained him at 4 Baokang Lane outside the Qiangzhe River in the British Concession. Chen committed suicide on the third day of his abduction, and his body was buried underground. In the third case, on May 27, 1930, at 6 PM, Huang Yuyi, the deputy manager of the Zhongnan Bank, who lived at 22 Baojian Road, was kidnapped on Haig Road. At that time, Huang's driver, Jiang Yunshan, and bodyguard, Wu Xueying, were killed, and another bodyguard, Ma Pinghan, was seriously injured. Afterwards, Wu Kunshan, who was sent by the victim to negotiate the ransom, was lured to Zhongshan Road and shot to death. Zheng Tangsheng and Shang Zhen were present at the scene. In the fourth case, on March 5, 1931, at 5 PM, Liang Huiwu, the comprador of Jardine Matheson, was kidnapped in Tianjin and hidden at 40 No. 38 Road in the British Concession. Three days after the kidnapping, his body was buried in the backyard garden. In the fifth case, on November 11, 1931, Shang Zhen was involved in the kidnapping of Chen Yanghe, the deputy manager of the Siming Bank, in front of 865 Avenue Foch. In the sixth case, on December 16, 1931, a person named Little Shaoxing had a feud with Fei Xinbao. Fei arranged for Liu Yimin and others to lure Little Shaoxing to Avenue Petain and kill him, abandoning the body and fleeing. In the seventh case, on January 6, 1932, at 10 AM, Gu Zizhen's five-year-old son, Gu Zelin, who lived at 95 Route Massenet, was kidnapped at the entrance of the West Adams Road West Adams Lane, with Zheng Tangsheng in charge of watching the hostage. In the eighth case, on August 30, 1932, the architect He Shaoting was kidnapped at 84 Bubbling Well Road, which was done by the same perpetrators in the sixth case. In the ninth case, on February 12 of this year, Huang Baohua was kidnapped in front of 25 Route Ghisi. The police are prosecuting Zheng, Shang, Liu, Wu, Geng, and Li under Article 1, Section 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Kidnappers and are requesting the court to investigate and deal with the matter according to the law. Fang Qingshan, Cao Ziqing, Li Youren, and others are highly suspected in the case, and the police still need to investigate them. Zheng Yinshi, Yu Yuanzhou, Chang Jianxi, Wang Shikong, Bian Zengyan, and others were initially detained on suspicion, but after investigation, they were found to be unrelated to the case, and the police are not prosecuting them and should ask the court to rule on the matter. The court verified the tickets and ordered the police to take the defendants down and examine them one by one. Zheng Tangsheng, Shang Zhen, Liu Yimin, Wu Shaoting, and others all confessed to colluding with other fugitives to commit the above cases and sharing the spoils. Geng Huatang confessed that the house at 755 Haig Road was rented on behalf of Chu Yupu's concubine and that he did not know about the kidnapping and did not know Li A'er, who was arrested in the case, and that he had no plans to kidnap someone surnamed Cai at 953 Avenue Joffre. Li Yueshan admitted to participating in the Gu Zelin and He Shaoting cases. Cao Ziqing and Li Youren also admitted to participating in the Liang Huiwu case. They are currently serving a 15-year sentence for another kidnapping case in the Public Concession. Fang Qingshan confessed that he was a cook at Geng Huatang's house and knew nothing about the kidnapping. Zheng Chenshi, Yu Yuanzhou, Chang Jianxi, Wang Shikong, Bian Zengyan, and others all confessed that they had no connection to the kidnapping case. By this time, it was dusk, and the judge ordered that the debate be adjourned to a later date. The defendants were returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>A Dead Thief's Body Found in Xiaobang River</h3>
<p>Shot and Drowned in the River in the Dark; Autopsy Performed by the Court Yesterday and Body Claimed</p>
<p>Around 7 PM the night before last, four armed robbers, including Sun Qi from Qingkou, set out from Zhabei with the intention of robbing a resident at 180 Kunming Road. This was discovered by the Yulin Road Police Station. Chief Chinese Detective Su Changsheng, Yang Peisheng, Detectives Li Pengfei, Ma Wenda, and more than a dozen others, along with Western detectives, all armed, waited in ambush at strategic locations on Taopeng Road. After a while, Sun and the robbers arrived one after another. The detectives surrounded and apprehended them. In a panic, the robbers opened fire to resist arrest. The Chinese and Western detectives also drew their guns and returned fire. A total of more than twenty shots were exchanged. As a result, Sun Qi was captured on the spot, and the remaining robbers took the opportunity to escape. It was dark, so it was impossible to pursue them. A stray bullet injured an old woman, Shen Xu, and a young woman, Gong Baobao, both of whom were taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. Sun was taken to the police station, where he confessed that his accomplices were Xu Xiaoerzi, Wang Xiaoyubiao, and Kou Da, who had been invited to rob. The police chief ordered him to be detained. At dawn yesterday, a male corpse with a bullet wound in his abdomen was found in a small river on Taopeng Road. The police received the report and knew that it was Sun's accomplice. At the time of the attempted arrest, he was shot by the detective's return fire and fell into the river. They then took Sun to identify the body, which he confirmed was his accomplice, Xu Xiaoerzi. The detectives then took the body to the Fei Lun Road morgue to await the autopsy. Sun was escorted to the First Special District Court, briefly questioned, and ordered to be returned to custody. As for Xu's body, the prosecutor Guo Wei arrived at the morgue to confirm the cause of death. It was determined that the deceased, Xu Xiaoerzi, had resisted arrest and was shot in the abdomen by a detective on the spot, resulting in death. The body was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Notorious Robber Yin Xinren Executed by Hanging</h3>
<p>Requested Fruit Before Execution, Saying It Would Cleanse Him for His Heavenly Journey</p>
<p>Yin Xinren, a notorious robber from Taixing, 38 years old, was arrested for resisting arrest and shooting and killing Zhao Xiaohe, a detective, at a teahouse at 730 Avenue de France on October 22 of last year. He was escorted by detectives from the Laozha Police Station to the First Special District Court. In the waiting room, he boldly seized a handgun prepared by the Chinese police, hoping to commit violence and escape. He was apprehended, brought back to the police station, and interrogated. He then used bamboo chopsticks to stab a person delivering food to the prison, causing a wound of four to five inches. The injured person collapsed and was taken to the hospital for treatment by the police. The robber, who had committed numerous crimes, was eventually tried by the court and sentenced to death. The sentence was reported to the provincial government for approval. Yesterday morning, the day of execution arrived. The police escorted Yin to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The prisoner requested that the customary reward of wine and food, worth two yuan, be used to buy fruit, such as pears, bananas, and jujubes, for him to eat before his execution. He said that he would be a vegetarian before death, to cleanse himself for his heavenly journey, and that the remaining money should be used to buy paper ingots to be burned, so that he would have money to use in the underworld. After a while, the executioner, Judge Shen Shanzeng, arrived in court and ordered the prisoner to be brought to the court. He asked if he had any last words or wanted to send a letter to his family. Yin said that both of his parents were dead and his wife had gone with someone else, so he had nothing else to say. Judge Shen then ordered the Chinese and Western detectives to take Yin down, along with the entire case file and photographs, and escort him to the Caoxi Road execution ground in a car. The prosecutor appointed by the local court arrived at the scene to verify the identity of the person being executed. Yin Xinren was then hanged.</p>
<h3>Shandong Compatriots Plead for Relief for the Great Yellow River Disaster</h3>
<p>The Shandong Association in Shanghai Appeals to the National Government</p>
<p>Due to the Yellow River's flood, which caused disasters in Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, the Shandong Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the National Government the day before yesterday, saying: To Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, We humbly report that the Yellow River's flood has caused a major disaster in the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Jiangsu, especially in the southwestern Shandong areas of Heze, Juye, Fanpu, Yuncheng, Dongping, and Shouzhang, where more than ten counties have been severely affected. The floodwaters have destroyed homes and drowned countless victims. Those who are fortunate enough to survive are suffering from the same plight and are in dire need of assistance. The situation is unprecedentedly tragic. As the Shandong Association is deeply connected to our homeland, we are deeply saddened and distressed. In addition to urgently raising relief funds for immediate assistance, we dare to appeal to the Executive Yuan to appoint senior officials to bring food and funds to provide immediate relief and save lives. Furthermore, the frequent disasters along the riverbanks of various provinces are primarily due to the lack of both funds and talent. We humbly request the Executive Yuan to allocate a portion of the cotton and wheat loan specifically for Yellow River management and to send the water conservancy experts hired in cooperation with the League of Nations to assist in the overall management of river control. In this way, the river can be secured, and the people can live in peace, which is the sincere hope and prayer of the Shandong people in Shanghai. We humbly request that our request be granted, and we await your orders with great trepidation. Shandong Association in Shanghai, respectfully.</p>

<h3>Report from the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee on the Yellow River Breach Disaster</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee considers the current Yellow River breach to be a major event and sent a special commissioner, Zheng Shouchang, to conduct an on-site investigation. The following is an excerpt from his report: I arrived in Xuzhou last month and reached Lanfeng by train on the night of the 1st of this month. The heavy rain had not stopped, and there were no hotels, so I went to the Chinese Anglican Church. With the guidance of Pastor Chen, I found that the water level had risen in the area on the 21st of last month, breaching the north-south embankment in the middle of the old Yellow River channel behind Zhenpu Village, about fifteen miles west of Lanfeng. The breach was about ten feet wide, and the water flowed eastward, covering an area up to three miles wide and reaching a depth of over thirty feet in Xuzhou. All the sandy land in the old Yellow River channel, planted with peanuts, crops, etc., was completely flooded. Later, I went to the mouth of the old Yellow River channel about half a mile outside the north gate. The water level had receded significantly, but it was still five or six feet deep. Although the water flowed eastward, it was still connected to the old channel. Unfortunately, the breached embankment has not yet been blocked. This is the situation of the flood in the area near Xuzhou and Lanfeng. Also, the area of Leizhai and Wuliji in the second and third districts, about thirty miles north of Lanfeng County, also breached at the same time, flowing eastward for a distance of sixty to seventy miles and spreading into Kaocheng County. From the south embankment to the north embankment to the border of Hebei Province, it is about a hundred miles long, and the water is more than ten feet deep (the water has receded, leaving yellow sand and soil), which is also about ten feet deep. The villages and fields along the embankment have been flooded, and countless people and livestock have died and been swept away. All that can be seen are treetops, houses, and land, all of which have been reduced to nothing. Those who escaped have no food or shelter. Wealthy families have either taken refuge with relatives or become beggars, while others live in makeshift sheds made of sorghum stalks, with only the clothes on their backs. Everything else has been lost to the flood. This is the tragic situation in the area north of Lanfeng.</p>

<h3>Preparatory Meeting of the Accountants Association</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang People in Shanghai Telegraph the Lushan Conference Regarding the Development of Sanmen Bay</h3>
<p>Requesting an Allocation of 10 Million Yuan from the Cotton and Wheat Loan</p>
<p>The government and the people have been working on the development of Sanmen Bay for a long time, but it has not been realized due to the country's economic difficulties.

<h3>Promoting Chrysanthemum Cinerariifolium Planting for Home Industry</h3>
<p>Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium has the effect of eliminating bedbugs, mosquitoes, lice, aphids, scarabs, all kinds of beetles, and pests on poultry, livestock, fur, and agricultural products, etc. Japan produces it annually, and besides its domestic use, its sales to China and Europe and the United States are more than 50 million yuan, an astonishing amount. The cultivation of this kind of agricultural product is harmless to rice and wheat, as it can be rotated after the autumn harvest every year. In rural areas, it can be an extra harvest in addition to rice and wheat. Now, the Family Industry Association is working directly with rural cooperatives in conjunction with the Shanghai Bank to provide seeds for planting. Experts are hired to guide the management and technology. All harvests will be purchased preferentially by the association. Although someone has organized this matter before, the scope was too small and the efficiency was minimal. Now that the Family Industry Association is promoting it, it is expected that the output in three to five years may exceed that of Japan, which is also good news for rural areas.</p>

<h3>The Fate of Chinese National Products</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The recent promotion of national products in China can be described as shouting at the top of one's voice and doing everything possible. Since January 28th, we have been talking about boycotting Japanese goods and using national products every day. The numbers recorded in newspapers, the speeches delivered in meetings, and the propaganda on the streets, I ask, how much have we actually boycotted Japanese goods? How much have we actually used national products? Do Chinese people have accurate investigations? Detailed statistics? If we examine it, we don't know whether we will be covered in sweat and feel ashamed to the point of having nowhere to go? The results of one year have neither harmed the Japanese in the slightest, but have instead fueled their rampant behavior. The Japanese once said that the amount of goods they received from the boycott in the Chinese market last year was twice the amount they sold in Southeast Asia and India. Why should they have any worries? Although their words may be exaggerated, the facts are like this, how can we remain silent? A friend who returned from Japan said that although the Japanese promotion of national products does not have the name of national control, it already has the reality of industry control. The strategies they adopt are six:</p>
<p>㈠ Production Restriction: For a certain factory, based on its needs, if it is assumed that there must be ten, then more than ten are not allowed to be established, so as not to oversupply and cause price competition, which would prevent it from standing in a stable position.</p>
<p>㈡ Division of Labor: For a certain industry, in addition to the same kind of manufacturing, those with related relationships, such as iron smelting, steel refining, and installation, adopt a division of labor and cooperation method to seek economy.</p>
<p>㈢ Joint Purchase of Raw Materials: The joint agency purchases raw materials from the same place, is responsible for transportation, and the price is low and the transportation is fast.</p>
<p>㈣ Research to Reduce Costs: Each factory recruits talents and pays attention to the improvement of products and the reduction of costs.</p>
<p>㈤ Pay Attention to Export Combinations: There are more than 140 Japanese export combinations around the world, proceeding step by step, leaving no loophole. There are more than 40 export combinations to China. The government tries its best to encourage them. Last year, the subsidy for the import combination in the Far East was 1.8 million yuan. There are three established methods: no unnecessary competition is allowed, no arbitrary price increases or decreases are allowed, and no infringement of business position is allowed. The expenditure on investigation fees is never stingy, and the travel expenses of people sent by various industries are also subsidized by the government, which shows its intention.</p>
<p>㈥ Pay Attention to Sales Combinations: The industry association has great power. The government and the industry association are currently paying attention to the activities of sales merchants. Recently, they have been promoting Dutch, Javanese, Indian, and Singaporean merchants to sell for them, using extremely low prices and extremely generous benefits to induce them in many ways, which has achieved great results.</p>
<p>In Japan, national products are almost used everywhere, but the government still sets up a national product promotion committee, stipulates a national product memorial day, and the intention to promote national products is everywhere in newspapers, magazines, meetings, and roads. Recently, the government convened ministers, experts from various industries to study the non-national products currently used in Japan, and there are more than 140 kinds. After various studies, more than 120 kinds can be replaced by national products, and only 20 kinds have to use foreign goods temporarily, which shows their attention. Recently, Mr. Zhang Gongquan went to Japan for sightseeing. What he saw and heard was mostly like this. People are advancing while we are retreating. People are knives and chopping boards, we are fish and meat. People have sharpened their swords and are waiting, but we are indifferent and unmoved. The fate of Chinese national products is like this, what could be more painful. It is also said that if the government agencies in Japan purchase goods and the purchasers are careless and misuse foreign goods, they will not be reimbursed to show punishment. The spirit of unity between officials and the people is like this, can the people of our country remain unmoved?</p>
<p>National Products Talk</p>
<h3>The Life and Death of National Product Factories</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>An industrialist with a lot of experience said: During the National Products Year, everyone said good things. In my opinion, the future of national products has reached the point of no remedy. If there is no improvement, I am afraid that they will all close down in five years. When he said this kind of discouraging words, I asked him for the truth. He said that the facts are like this, and there is no denying it. If you compare the national product factories in China with others, the first is that the capital is not as good as others, the second is that the knowledge is not as good as others, the third is that the experience is not as good as others, the fourth is that the unity of doing things is not as good as others, the fifth is that the cost is not as cheap as others, and the sixth is that the products are not as good as others. It is already extremely dangerous and extremely pitiful. In addition, all countries in the world are currently feeling overproduction. One's products can't be sold to another country, and another's products are desperately trying to be sold to countries with immature industries. Everyone wants to find a way out. After looking around, only China can still turn around. They are the residences for their products. If you are like this, and he is like this, the result is that they all build deep trenches and high fortresses and use tariffs as the only weapon, and they use China as the only market for all countries in the world to sell their national products. How can it be possible for the Chinese people to have some means to fight against them? How can it be possible for the Chinese people to have some preparations to deal with them? As a result, is there still room for the existence of Chinese goods factories?</p>
<h3>National Products in the Eyes of Women</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The biggest customers of goods on the market are of course women in general. The wheel of the times in 1932 has not yet passed, and they are already looking for and buying new products in 1933. These women who are the prelude to the times are all knowledgeable, leisurely classes, modern female students, aristocratic ladies, etc. They neither have a correct understanding of national products, nor do national products have standards for them to use as goals. Therefore, they unconsciously and naturally serve as obligatory salespersons for foreign goods of imperialists! This kind of atmosphere will spread to female workers working in factories and women in the interior, emulating the frenzy of women in big cities, how heartbreaking?</p>
<p>Promoting national products... has been going on for several years, and it is simply tiring to hear. Only now are we gradually progressing with the wheel of the times. National Products Week, National Products Year, National Products Commercial Ground, National Products Company, consumer cooperatives, everyone is working together, shouting and doing, but national products in the eyes of women are still like Liu Yi at sea. In the three famous companies, if we go to tour them separately, the liveliness and loneliness are obvious facts. The national products companies welcomed by women in general are few and far between. There are probably only a few famous national products stores that they are happy to visit. Now they are gradually paying attention to the Chinese National Products Company. It is unknown whether they can be persevering and always recognize clearly, or whether it is still a question!</p>
<h3>The Three Eras of National Products</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>In the past, before the sea ban was lifted, everything that the Chinese people needed for their daily use was made from their own raw materials and by their own manufacture. This can be said to be a pure national product era, or the first era of national products.</p>
<p>After the sea ban was lifted, people in general felt that foreign goods were beautiful in style and convenient to use, so they changed their minds and unanimously purchased foreign goods. Later, some people carefully observed the foreign goods and felt that there was no great difficulty in their structure and imitation. So they went to their raw material suppliers and bought raw materials like returning onions, and then asked their technicians (referring to foreign technicians) to manufacture them in the same way. This can be said to be the national product imitation era, or the second era of national products.</p>
<p>Up to now, many Chinese people have clear minds. They deeply know that such imitation of others, purchasing of others' raw materials, and producing crudely and shoddily to supply to the Chinese people, you want to know how discerning the Chinese people are under such a trend, will he still come to use your warehouse of crudely and shoddily produced products? So their minds are relatively fresh, they want to study where the raw materials are produced? Does China have it after all? What kind of style should the products be to suit the general public? What kind of quality should the products be to be durable? How can the sales of the products be smooth and unimpeded? Study carefully and strive for excellence, even if his products cannot gain a foothold in the national product industry!</p>
<p>But now, there are still people who are like the second era of national products, and they are even afraid that the imitation is not enough, even the bottle of a cosmetic product, if the foreign product is a wine jar style, we are also a wine jar style, and the box for filling the bottle, if they are printed in yellow, we also print in yellow. This is simply too similar to imitate. Haven't you seen foreign merchants often sue Chinese merchants for imitation in the newspapers? When it comes to the result, either the imitated products are all confiscated, or they are ordered to stop business. Although this is the means of the imperialists, the Chinese's deliberate imitation is indeed true.</p>
<p>This is really a very sad sentence. Among national products, except for some products that have not been fully improved; nine out of ten can be said to be imitations of foreign products. So I have said long ago that national products should be thought of from the aspect of creation. The things that are manufactured should transcend everything. Not only should they surpass all domestic products, but they should also surpass foreign goods. That's how to cater to the psychology of modern Chinese people. If you insist on the old ways, failure will be in front of you.</p>
<p>Most of the people who operate national product businesses are merchants. Although there are also some with superior knowledge, there are also quite a few who only seek profit and disregard everything. Because of this, his products are perfunctory and will never have a day to develop. I think that in order for the products to sell well, we should put in effort in all aspects.</p>
<p>There are really too few people in China who study industrial arts and crafts. The government does not have a way to reward them, so many talents have been buried. If the people who operate national product businesses can unite with the people who study industrial arts and crafts and create many unique products, they will definitely shock the Chinese people!</p>
<p>In the current situation, it is really a mixed era of national products, or it can be said to be the third era of national products.</p>
<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3>The "Boom Month" of National Products</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>July and August (lunar calendar) is the time for various places to purchase goods, and it is also the time when our national product factories' goods sell well in the interior. There is a very common saying on the Shanghai market called "boom month". This probably refers to the second and third months of the spring and the current July and August丨Because the business in these months is booming, different from the usual months, but at this time, rural bankruptcy, the economic collapse in the interior, the extremely depressed taste, plus the Yellow River flood, the business in the Northwest is greatly affected, and the Zhuang customers in various places, although they always have to come out to purchase goods as usual and transport them back for sale in the second half of the year, however, as far as the impact is concerned, everything is not, and various bad phenomena also occur. Under the gift of this "boom month", the following findings have been made:</p>
<p>Regarding the customer's side: ㈠ Substandard goods are sold in abundance. This can prove that the purchasing power of the general public is extremely weak now. They give up the top-notch goods and don't add them, but only sell substandard goods on the active market. The decline of national products is the main reason.</p>
<p>The repayment is slow. According to the habit of merchants, tickets are usually issued every ten days, or cleared every month, but now they always delay. This also shows that the economy in the interior is tight and the turnover is not smooth, and the fundamental reason is naturally the slow sales.</p>
<p>Regarding their own aspects: ㈠ Price competition and internal strife among the industry is the most heartbreaking thing in our country's market. Now, because the market is not good, prices are falling, and they compete with each other and seek their own interests.</p>
<p>㈡ Manufacturing substandard goods to cater to customer psychology and specialize in making substandard goods to meet the market. In the minds of general merchants, they only want to make some profits from it, and they don't study the smooth production and sales of national products. Therefore, we have to take full responsibility for opening up this serious situation and actively proceed. The most heartbreaking internal strife and price competition make the Zhuang customers enjoy their profits, and the really buying public may not see the cheap price. This kind of inferior nature must first be eradicated from the root. The steps are: First, the industry associations should jointly determine the prices of goods, the selling prices should be the same, and they should be strictly observed. Second, notify the factories not to make substandard goods, and reduce the prices of the top-notch goods as much as possible to promote them and avoid confusion in the market. Then, they should gradually solve the fundamental problems such as how to enable national product factories to directly trade with buyers in the interior without going through merchants, and the cooperation between production and sales.</p>
<p>In the midst of wind and rain and the crisis is lurking everywhere, in this "boom month", how will the people in charge of national products consider the situation and exhaust their minds to save this already collapsed tide?</p>
<h3>Promoting National Products and Mass Education</h3>
<p>— Xing Guangyi</p>
<p>I have a kind of suspicion about education: that is, the higher the level of education, the more foreign goods are used. It seems that Chinese education is only teaching students to use foreign goods. This observation is proved by the fact that the level of education and the consumption of national products are in direct proportion. Then, to put it bluntly, why are we doing this kind of education?</p>
<p>Now the voice of promoting national products is rising, and everyone has discussed the promotion of national products a lot, but no one has paid attention to the relationship between national products and education itself, especially mass education.</p>
<p>It seems that the purpose of education is to become an official and seize money. As long as there is money, there is nothing that cannot be done. So they only seek to gain without working and despise production and manufacturing. Outside, there are even cheap, beautiful, charming and exquisite foreign goods that dazzle our eyes. So this impression is deeply engraved in the minds of the Chinese people, and they naturally increase their faith in foreign goods and are seduced by foreign goods. What ability does the popularization of education have to resist the tide? Some people say: "National products should be sold to the countryside丨" Of course, I also agree, but how can we sell national products to the countryside is a problem, and it can never be done out of thin air. Here, we should pay the most attention to mass education!</p>
<p>There are so many illiterates in our country, and most of the masses are ignorant. They don't know what "national products" are. The current problem of mass education is to improve the intelligence of the people and increase production. However, improving the intelligence of the people is never to guide them from the countryside to the city, from coarse cloth to Parisian silk, from dry tobacco pipes to British brands, and even foreign turbidity, foreign fire, foreign candles, foreign porcelain, foreign cloth and satin, foreign umbrellas... and all things foreign. If we improve the intelligence of the people in this way, the more the intelligence of the people is improved, the more dangerous the national products will be!</p>
<p>Under the current situation, how should the future mass education change its direction and implement "national product education"! It seems not very appropriate to take education as a method to solve the country's urgent and major problems. In fact, the educational facilities must be changed with the different needs of the times, and the greatest purpose of education is to enrich the country and strengthen the people, and promoting national products is the way to enrich the country!</p>
<h3>A Humble Proposal on How National Product Industries Should Avoid Bad Debts</h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengxun</p>
<p>丨Contribute a few naive opinions丨</p>
<p>The current situation is so turbulent and unstable, and the social economy is so difficult and uneasy. Under the natural disasters and man-made misfortunes, the national product industry is like an infant with congenital deficiencies, who has no nourishing nutrition after birth. In particular, some national product factories have just managed to achieve some success and stand on their feet in the midst of a thousand patches and repairs of short funds. Because they have suffered several times from huge bad debts from customers, they have become unable to turn around and declared bankruptcy. Or some people want to continue to take over, but the shadow of the past is too bad, and they dare not take any more risks. So those who own huge assets do not think about investing more, and those who are engaged in national product businesses are anxious day and night to prevent the approaching of defaults. They all stand still, let alone making progress. The lifeline of national products is becoming more and more urgent. This is really a very painful thing!</p>
<p>Because the customary practice of commercial changes is like this, if you want to promote your products far and near, you must extend credit to customers. If you want to do business, you have to ask people to prepare cash to buy your goods, which is impossible. In recent years, national product industries have been</p>

<p>Visiting Notes</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Dahua Match Factory</h3>
<p>It is truly shameful to say! Foreign goods flood our country, so much so that you can find them in any environment. Even on your own person, perhaps you can find quite a few! Yes, in today's China, where industry is undeveloped and real businesses are not thriving, if you were to examine the average citizen, you would find many foreign goods in their lives! In fact, you don't even need to ask them why they prefer foreign goods; it's not hard to imagine the reasons! The prices are too high, they feel the goods are inferior, or perhaps they've been buying them for so long that they're used to it. What is promoting domestic goods? That's what they would answer you!</p>
<p>As an intellectual myself, seeing my fellow countrymen favoring foreign goods, I do my best to persuade them to switch to domestic goods, but I can only feel sorrow in my heart. Even more sorrowful is that many intellectuals don't even consider the purchase of domestic versus foreign goods as a significant matter!</p>
<p>In my spare time from public duties, I considered visiting domestic goods factories. The goal was to plant the seeds of patriotism and support for domestic goods in the hearts of children. However, due to the burden of work and grading papers, I often wished to go, but was constrained by time. This time, because school had not yet started, I was introduced by my friends Mr. Mao and Mr. Shen, and was able to take the ferry to Liuliqiao in Pudong, Shanghai, and visit the Dahua Match Factory. I hereby record what I remembered during the visit:</p>
<p>The factory is located west of Liuliqiao, separated from Shanghai by only a river, and transportation is relatively convenient. Mr. Mao, Mr. Shen, and I walked to the gatehouse, and the gatekeeper immediately informed the inside. Before long, he brought out three passes and handed them to us. Led by Chief Chen Hanjian of the Engineering Department, we were able to visit all the facilities and observe the work inside the factory.</p>
<p>First, we went to the stem-sorting department, where countless messy match stems were piled up in the room. Two workers operated a machine, and another worker poured the messy stems onto it. Before long, they were all straightened. After the stems were straightened, several child laborers neatly placed them into square trays, presumably to take them out and put them into another machine to remove any that were uneven or unaligned! In one corner of the same room, two other workers managed two machines. Their job was to remove matchsticks with stems at both ends, as well as other oddly shaped matches! Mr. Chen said that the stem-sorting department is the first step in the match-making process.</p>
<p>Then we went to the second factory building, where there were many sections. Some removed stems that were too thick or thin, while others flattened stems in trays that were uneven in height. After the stems were arranged in trays, several workers coated the heads of the stems with a substance, in order to make the matches easier to light. Mr. Chen explained that this is why the match stems have distinct yellow and white sections! The wax tray was large and flat, and the oil simmered smoothly. The workers dipped the stems slightly, and they could be coated with phosphorus in a moment. The phosphorus was mixed with chemicals, and after the phosphorus was mixed by the machine, it was poured into a large machine pan to be ground finely. If this was not done, the finished matches would often have bursting or other defects. After the phosphorus was applied, they were taken to the drying department to be dried and boxed. In the drying room, there was a stove and a fan above it. Mr. Chen said that the purpose of installing the fan was to evenly distribute the heat from the stove around the room. In this way, the black heads of the matches would be beautiful and shiny. Otherwise, if the fan was not installed, the matches near the stove would often have black heads that were dry and stiff.</p>
<p>Later, we went to the boxing department, where we saw many female workers in two large rooms, all boxing matches. In the room, there was a path, with large boxes being packed on the left and small boxes on the right. The large boxes were branded "Horse" and sold well in the southeastern provinces of China, while the small boxes were branded "Cannon" and sold well in South and North China. When asked by Mr. Chen how many trademarks there were, he said there were many. From the boxing department to the packaging department, there were also many female workers who quickly wrapped ten boxes of matches into a bundle. I exclaimed in admiration. Mr. Chen replied, "Practice makes perfect. They are paid by the package, so the more they do, the more they earn." In another corner of the room, some workers used bamboo strips and bamboo hats to make large packages, so that when they were shipped to other places, they would not get wet like those packed in boxes!</p>
<p>The factory produces fifty or sixty large packages a day, totaling tens of thousands of boxes. The factory is also expanding greatly, adding factory buildings to expand production. The factory has a library, a fire brigade, a workers' night school, a sports ground, and a small garden. The workers' dormitories are also very clean. Labor and management have a harmonious relationship. The management strives for the happiness of the workers, and the workers also do their best to increase production! It is also worth noting that the factory's night school classroom is also the dining hall. The benches in the hall are square rings, with four wooden sticks inside the ring. When in use, a board is pressed on them!</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, I could not visit in detail, which I regret!</p>
<p>As competition increases, it becomes more and more fierce. In the struggle for dominance, everyone takes doing more business as a prerequisite, and has no time to consider the creditworthiness and economic status of customers. Most salespeople accept anyone who comes, and give out credit freely. By the time the payment is due, all kinds of difficulties arise, and bad debts are often heard of. I work for a domestic goods factory, and I have witnessed many such incidents. After careful consideration, I feel that in this situation, it seems necessary to try our best to come up with ways to remedy bad debts within the possible range. Therefore, I simply put forward the following naive views:</p>
<p>(A) Salespeople are responsible for reviewing. Salespeople in domestic goods factories should understand that they are not merely responsible for making a large number of sales. In fact, their task is not complete until the payment is received smoothly. Because the internal staff are not familiar with whether the customer's store is solid or whether their finances are comfortable, they rely on the salesperson's report as the basis for granting credit. If the salesperson does not have a careful eye and precise methods, it will greatly affect the security of the credit. In the past, it was customary in the business world to believe that salespeople did not need sufficient knowledge, and that it was enough to be able to sell the products. However, in today's complex social situation, where business conditions change rapidly, salespeople really should have knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>(B) Customer Economic Status Test Form. We often see many shops with a long history and good reputation suddenly close down and liquidate. In advance, it is indeed impossible to find a way to prevent it. But there is a very convenient way to remedy it in case of emergency, which is to create a systematic form for each customer that records the facts of their transactions over the years. The form should list the dates of delivery and payment, whether the payment is prompt, and the length of the promissory note. In this record, we can measure whether the customer's foundation is naive or strong, and how their economic status has changed. For example, if the dates of recent deliveries and payments are far apart, and the term of the promissory note is very long, then we must know that the customer is not as reliable as before, and we should consider it or urge them to pay the account. If there is no form to show it, and we only rely on vague ideas to estimate, it is very dangerous.</p>
<p>(C) Mutual Supervision of Business Among the Same Industry. At present, any industry is competing fiercely. Not to mention open and secret rebates, even the business area is very competitive. As a result, a situation of being indiscriminate and responding to every request is created. Since the same industry does not cooperate openly and honestly, there is even less talk of exchanging information. Therefore, I feel that the method of mutual supervision of business is really urgent. Because the same industry has an organization to supervise business, the general salespeople will have the opportunity to explore and ask questions of each other. The customer account will also have an additional procedure of brainstorming and detailed review, which will provide a little more guarantee for granting credit. Moreover, this organization can directly eliminate business competition, and everyone takes the same steps, which is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>I feel that the above three unsystematic contributions are very naive. Moreover, many bad debt incidents in the business world are caused by unexpected events. In fact, there is no secret to foreknowledge. Furthermore, if you want to expand your business, you have to give more customer credit. If you want to reduce losses, it seems better to give less customer credit. In this absolutely contradictory situation, salespeople who are engaged in the domestic goods industry really feel a lot of pain. I very much welcome everyone to discuss these kinds of issues, because these are the obligations that we comrades who are committed to domestic goods should fulfill!</p>
<h3>Joint Business and Thorough Merger of Domestic Goods Enterprises</h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>Looking at the history of developing domestic goods enterprises, the reason why they are in a dying state and heading towards doom is that the dumping of foreign goods and poor management systems are certainly major reasons. In addition, the infighting and perennial struggles among the same industry, resulting in mutual harm, is also a fatal injury. Even if there are regulations that the same industry must follow on the surface, and there are indifferent associations, the competition of dreaming different dreams and acting independently becomes more intense. In the current year of constantly shouting about reducing labor, tightening budgets, and economic downturn, if there is no concrete way to give a shot in the arm, it is as dangerous as a patient with numerous external wounds and internal lung disease.</p>
<p>A few domestic goods enterprises that have already realized this have, in the past two or three years, created a joint business organization as if breaking through the siege. This organization is to establish a general distribution agency by connecting the same industry, and under the joint responsibility of the factory leaders, it achieves the effect of consistent business steps. From a practical point of view, we feel that the benefits that this organization contributes to an enterprise are indeed great, but from the perspective of overall cooperation, this is still a very one-sided and naive motive, and not a permanent destination.</p>
<p>Because simply uniting the business is not enough to unite the strength of an enterprise, and even more so because the concepts of interests in each factory cannot be eliminated, and there is still the idea of competing to be first, we dare to examine the joint business organizations of several domestic goods enterprises. It cannot completely recruit the participation of the same industry, and it fails soon after its creation, and many are fleeting. Only a few can obtain a thin lifeline and continue to work intermittently.</p>
<p>If the joint business is abolished because it cannot achieve the entire effect, and because the abolition restores the go-it-alone state of not being united, and the old state of competition among the same industry is revived, then there is no way to save it. We must understand that joint business at least has the advantage of brainstorming and taking steps in a disciplined manner. We must study this preliminary organization and take a further step to think of a thorough cooperation. How to be thorough? That is to follow the footsteps of European and American industries and implement the merger of the same industry.</p>
<p>In our country's industrial world, mergers of the same industry are rare, and it can be said that there are none. This is indeed a complicated and important matter. Each factory has its own fundamental position and internal asset share issues. When merging, there will inevitably be places where there are differences in weight. If you broaden your horizons and hope that there will be no competition in the future process and that it will flourish, then the money and time spent on the trouble during the preparation period is very worthwhile.</p>
<p>If the merger of the same industry is successful, not only will the business be unified, but there will also be advantages in product selection to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses. The emerging industries are gradually assisted and merged, and the social recognition is also becoming more unified. In terms of resisting foreign goods, there is more abundant spirit and ability without worrying.</p>
<p>I believe that joint business is the foundation for mergers of the same industry. The organizations that have already joined the joint business should prepare quickly. All other industries that are in a smoky atmosphere should also pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>Contributing Opinions</p>
<h3>A Careless Mistake</h3>
<p>— Lantian</p>
<p>In this day and age, most gentlemen are making vigorous propaganda on promoting domestic goods in their speech and writing. They are truly enthusiastic patriots and can be said to be sparing no effort. However, very few of them have noticed that a very small and ordinary thing will make people more than ten years later have a vague impression and chaotic thoughts, and will not feel any pain or itch about domestic goods. What is this? Since the Chinese people were conquered by imperialism with force to open ports and trade, they have also used various economic policies to subdue us, so that our long-standing contemptuous psychology has turned into a psychology of worship. It seems that material civilization can only be created and invented by foreigners, and the Chinese people will never catch up. Therefore, whether this kind of goods comes from abroad and has been transformed by China itself, or is made by our own country, as long as it is novel and eye-catching, we do not distinguish right from wrong and collectively call it "foreign", such as soft yarn and cloth are called "foreign" yarn and "foreign" cloth, fine and clean thread and rope are called "foreign" thread and "foreign" head rope, cloth umbrellas for sunny days are called "foreign" umbrellas, enamel is called "foreign" porcelain, candles with wire cores are called "foreign" candles, small knives are called "foreign" knives, thread socks are called "foreign" socks, leather shoes are called "foreign" shoes, ... I can't write much here for a while. Although we know that they are domestic products, due to habitual laziness, we unconsciously blurt out the words, burying the domestic goods themselves at the bottom of the vast "foreign" sea.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that the general uneducated illiterates blurt out "foreign" and close their mouths with "foreign"! But those who are in the domestic goods industry and serve a small number of people, or the general primary school teachers who are entrusted with the mission of education to create the future masters of China, and the parents of the families, are also blindly following and shouting, isn't that too ridiculous?</p>
<h3>Go Buy Domestic Goods!</h3>
<p>— Huang Movei</p>
<p>In the mainland business world, domestic goods companies praise and sell all kinds of goods, and they are all complete.</p>
<p>The goods are so beautiful and the prices are so low! We go to buy things to eat, wear, and use, and we really feel: It is patriotic, economical, and cheap! Everyone go buy them quickly, go buy them from the "Domestic Goods General Warehouse"! The Japanese use peaches to teach children, explaining that peaches are produced in a certain place in China. The purpose is to suggest to children that they have a deep impression. If they do not seize the place that produces peaches, there is no hope of eating peaches and surviving. But how do the Chinese teach children? It is clear that this thing is a Chinese product, but it is made to be confused and inexplicable. Originally, many things were indeed introduced from foreign countries at first, but at present, there are many domestic goods invented or imitated by the Chinese themselves. So why "call a deer a horse" and still put the word "foreign" on it? Is it possible that only foreigners can make "foreign" goods, and Chinese people cannot make "domestic" goods? It is hoped that in the future, people who serve in the domestic goods industry, school teachers, and family parents must pay attention to this. If small things are neglected, it will have a bad impact on domestic goods, which is also creating a kind of shame for ourselves.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Introduction</p>
<h3>Two Things Worth Introducing</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Forgive me for being forgetful. I don't know which English novel said that a German, because of the stimulation of the people after the European War, suffered even more, so German expatriates in other countries became more enthusiastic about patriotism and promoted domestic goods. That German lived in England. One day, he ran out of cigarettes. For a while, he couldn't buy them from his home country. He walked all over London to buy German cigarettes. He searched for a long time. He finally managed to buy a pack of cigarettes that no one had asked about for a long time in a small grocery store. He was overjoyed and extremely happy. Later, he asked the owner of the small grocery store. He was also a German expatriate. His cigarettes were prepared for himself to smoke. When he saw someone coming to buy them, he was very surprised. He gave a pack of the cigarettes he often smoked to the buyer. Later, he made a good friend abroad. I won't say whether these facts are true or not. I think the Germans' patriotism and promotion of domestic goods are meticulous. Looking back at our Chinese people, they think that smoking foreign cigarettes is not enough to show off their wealth. They even want to smoke imported cigars! In comparison, the Chinese are too unpatriotic.</p>
<p>I also remember a friend saying that he had lived in Japan for more than ten years. He also held a position in a Japanese department store. When he met me, he often said that the Chinese are too unpatriotic. Japanese expatriates living in China use things that are all from their own country. Even for a toothbrush or a pack of toothpaste, they have to write a letter to their home country to buy it. This is how much they love to use domestic goods. But the Chinese are just the opposite. They think that if it is not an imported product, it is not enough to show that he is a modern person. He can't wait to learn everything from foreigners. It's a pity that his eyes are not green and his skin is not naturally white. Otherwise, he would definitely say that I am a European and American race. China is too undeveloped. From this point of view, Japan's strength is not an accident. You can know it by looking at the patriotism of the people. Chinese people, wake up.</p>

<h3>Domestic Toothbrushes and Toothpaste</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>Teeth are not only related to people's appearance, but also to people's health. If a person wants to have clean, white, and strong teeth, he must pay special attention to the toothbrushes and toothpaste he uses every day!</p>
<p>Most people often believe in foreign goods, but they don't know that some domestic toothbrushes and toothpaste are more economical and practical than foreign goods. For example, the "131 Toothbrush" specially produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy is made of high-quality materials after disinfection. The concave shape is suitable and can be matched with each person's teeth and will never shed bristles, which is beneficial to hygiene. "131 Toothpaste" is made according to scientific methods. It is delicate and fragrant and can whiten teeth. It can also kill the bacteria in the mouth and never cause cavities. These two daily necessities are worth introducing.</p>
<p>Brief news The pencil is widely used. The only domestic pencil factory in our country is Dahua in Hong Kong. Since the factory came to Shanghai to set up a branch, it has tried its best to promote sales. It has been certified by Shanghai Mayor Wu and the principals of various famous schools that it is a purely domestic product, so sales are popular throughout the country. A few days ago, the chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce sent a special letter to the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that the factory is a completely Chinese-owned organization, and all the machines are also self-made. Please promote it. Wang Xiaolai of the Chamber of Commerce also inscribed the name.</p>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Marriage Change</h3>
<p>— Xu Hongxia</p>
<p>The news of Hu Dazai's engagement to Ms. He Qin Fang was a surprise to his friends.</p>
<p>Indeed, from the point of view of all their circumstances, there was no possibility of engagement. Ms. He was a wealthy and powerful lady who had received a university education. Hu Dazai was a poor boy "without a tile to cover his head or a place to stand". The difference between the two was like "thirty-three heavens and eighteen levels of hell".</p>
<p>Ms. He originally had a lover, Dr. Wu Junren, who was a Japanese doctor of law and whose family was also very well-off. Friends were all sure that their marriage would not change.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Ms. He sent letters to Hu Dazai and Wu Junren, asking them each to send her a summer dress. Wu Junren received the letter and quickly ran to Company X to buy a pink-blooded silk cheongsam made of domestic goods and personally sent it to her.</p>
<p>Hu Dazai received the letter and suddenly realized his economic panic. He also felt that Ms. He was deliberately making things difficult for the poor. They had not been in contact for a long time, so why did she suddenly want a piece of clothing today? He touched his pocket and only had a dollar and a few cents left. Buying clothing was out of the question.</p>
<p>He thought about it and thought about it. He didn't even feel like eating dinner. He borrowed two dollars from a friend and ran to the XX Domestic Goods Company to buy a cheongsam material made of anti-Japanese yarn. He was embarrassed to send it himself, so he specially asked someone to send it to Ms. He. The next day, Wu Junren received a letter from Ms. He, which said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Junren:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the summer dress you sent. After careful examination of the goods, they are actually enemy goods. Your purchase of these goods is helping the enemy to support their economy, buy bombs, kill our compatriots, and seize our land. Isn't the pink color a symbol of the blood of our compatriots? I can't bear to wear it, so I am sending it back to you. At this time of national crisis, you are still buying enemy goods. You are not a friend of mine. Please do not contact me again from now on! I wish you enlightenment. He Qinfang, August 10th"</p>
<p>So, the next day, He Qinfang personally ran to Hu Dazai's residence, on the one hand to thank him for his kindness, and on the other hand to seek his consent. That day, the engagement ceremony was held at the Qianghua Hotel.</p>

<h3>Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Department of Education, Resigns</h3>
<p>Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Department of Education, is physically weak and has suffered from insomnia and dizziness for a long time. After returning to Hangzhou from his hometown this time, his old illness could not be eradicated, so he decided to resign. Yesterday, he had prepared a memorial and submitted it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to resign from his concurrent positions as a member of the Provincial Government and the Director of the Department of Education. He also submitted it to the Provincial Government for transfer. Chen's resignation this time is extremely firm. He has ordered the departments to complete the closure and will leave Hangzhou for Shanghai to recuperate in a day or two. The affairs of the department will be temporarily handled by Secretary Qian Jiazhizhan. According to Chen, he told reporters that his intention to resign was decided as early as three months ago. The old problem of neurasthenia has been repeated from time to time, and he feels that his physical strength has not fully recovered. He does not want to hold a heavy task for a long time. However, at that time, the provincial games and qualifying examinations were waiting to be presided over, and the graduation examinations of this year, both senior and junior high schools, were held at the same time, which was the first time in this province. At the same time, the provincial finances were very tight. For the new educational facilities, patching up and repairing houses cost a lot of research, so he temporarily remained in office and planned everything. Now that the examinations have been completed, the educational budget has been determined, and the new schools that are being prepared have also been established. All schools have already started. At this time, the start of the academic year is the most appropriate time for transition, so he decided to resign. The central academy has already entrusted someone to Chen Jin, and he should be able to obtain approval. After approval, he plans to follow the doctor's advice and take a complete rest for six months or a year to cure his old neurasthenia and then decide on his future service policy.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Purchases Rare Song Dynasty Edition</h3>
<p>Since the Song Dynasty, Zhejiang Province has been particularly renowned for its book collecting endeavors. The Fan Family’s Tianyi Pavilion was established during the late Ming Dynasty, while the Pinghua Studio, Zhenqi Hall, and Shousong Hall, among others, gained prominence in the early Qing Dynasty. Later, following the example of Anlu Lu’s Songlou and Qian Tang Ding’s Eight Thousand Scroll Building, they extensively acquired rare editions, earning widespread fame. Regrettably, the Lu family’s books soon flowed into Eastern Ying (Japan), and the Ding family’s books were also moved to Jinling (Nanjing). Few old families from the early Qing Dynasty remain, and renowned books and rare editions have been continuously flowing out of the province, leading to a decline in the book trade today, which knowledgeable people lament. The Sun family of Shousong Hall was a famous book-collecting family in Qian Tang during the early Qing Dynasty. Sun Yangzeng, the owner of the Siku Quanshu solicitation, once submitted a Song Dynasty edition of the "Collection of Inscriptions of Famous Song Dynasty Officials," which was recorded in the History section. Today, the Sun family has declined, and this book has survived numerous calamities. They wish to sell it to the government at a reasonable price. The collection, titled "Collection of Inscriptions of Famous Song Dynasty Officials," comprises 107 volumes in 32 books, written by Lin Dajiao of the Song Dynasty. It is an original engraving from the Shaoxi period of the Southern Song Dynasty, which was originally submitted during the Siku Quanshu solicitation and later returned. Subsequently, it was lost during the Taiping Rebellion and later recovered. During a fire that the Sun family experienced in the Republic Year Two, many fine books were destroyed, but this book happened to be in Shanghai and was spared. Now, the owner, Sun Kanghou, continues his ancestors' ambition and cherishes it deeply. However, Sun is devoted to learning and loves books but is unfamiliar with family management, leading to debt. Creditors intend to take the book as payment. Subsequently, prominent figures in the province, such as Wang Qianyang and Chen Qihui, fear that this precious book, which concerns the historical records of the province, will flow out of the province. They hope that the government will purchase it and preserve it within the province. The estimated value is three thousand yuan in national currency. The Zhejiang Provincial Library, inheriting the legacy of the Wenlan Pavilion, has a rich collection. However, good books outside the Siku Quanshu are mainly Ming Dynasty editions. It would be appropriate to seize the opportunity to collect them for public viewing. Therefore, they consulted with the library director, Chen Xun Ci. However, limited by a monthly budget of nine hundred yuan, even ordinary purchases are insufficient. They specially requested the provincial government to allocate a temporary book-buying fund of three thousand yuan for collection, to preserve it for the long term. The provincial government has already approved this proposal, and the Education Department is raising funds to order the purchase.</p>

<h3>Municipal Library Preparing for Book Circulation</h3>
<p>Also Planning to Expand the Library Site and Build Another Bookstore</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Library is currently preparing for book circulation and plans to expand the library site and build another bookstore. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Book Circulation</h3>
<p>In order to increase the opportunity for citizens to read books and to utilize the function of books, the library has recently prepared a book circulation group. Those who wish to borrow circulating books must first fill out an application form at the library and submit a deposit. After review, a library card will be issued for borrowing books. When borrowing is no longer needed, the library card will be returned, and the deposit will be refunded upon presentation of the receipt. A delivery department will also be set up to hire people to deliver books to readers in distant areas, making it very convenient. Once approved by the Municipal Education Bureau, circulation will begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Planning to Build a Bookstore</h3>
<p>The library is located in the Confucius Temple Park, and the site is not very spacious. There are only a little over a hundred seats inside, but an average of two to three hundred citizens read inside every day, and there is already a shortage of seats. The books stored in the upstairs bookstore total more than 20,000 volumes, and the bookstore is full, leaving almost no space. If the number of books increases in the future, it will be impossible to accommodate them. Therefore, the library plans to submit a request to the Municipal Education Bureau to recover the public land behind the library in order to build a bookstore and add reading rooms, so as to provide convenience for readers. This plan is currently being drafted and will soon be realized.</p>

<h3>A Local Autonomy Experiment Village Centered on Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Rural Improvement Association Approves Pilot Plan</p>
<p>Yao Huiquan, a member of the Shanghai County Rural Improvement Association, recently proposed a pilot plan for a local autonomy experiment village centered on elementary schools. The plan was approved by the second meeting of the association. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Location Selection The location of the experiment village should be selected according to the following principles: 1. There should be an elementary school principal and enthusiastic leaders trusted by the people. 2. There should be the ability to bear part of the expenses. 3. There should be concentrated villages. 4. There should be relatively convenient transportation facilities.</p>
<p>Preparations After the location is selected, a preparatory committee for the experiment village will be organized in conjunction with local people. The local elementary school principal and enthusiastic people will be designated to first visit places where village governance has been successfully implemented. The expenses will be borne by the association. Next, a detailed plan will be drafted and submitted to the county government for approval.</p>
<p>Administrative Organization The organization of the experiment village will follow the promulgated local autonomy laws and regulations. However, before the village head is elected by the people, he should be concurrently appointed by the county government as the principal of the local elementary school. The neighborhood chiefs and village chiefs will be selected by the village head and submitted to the county government for appointment. The village head will also appoint influential local figures as councilors to form a council. All actions will be supervised by the county government on one hand, guided by the association and the district office on the other, and accept the opinions of the local people on the other.</p>
<p>Funding The Funding should be in addition to the original elementary school expenses, a certain amount of money should be added for administrative expenses and a certain amount of money should be added for operating expenses. The monthly expenses should not exceed fifty yuan. The money will be shared by the county party headquarters, the county government, the district office, and the local area on average. Educational funding will be raised by the Education Bureau.</p>
<p>Experiment Period The duration of the experiment should be no more than three years. It must achieve the goals of popularizing education, increasing production, completing basic construction, establishing sound organizations, and electing village heads by the people. If it is found that there have been achievements after half a year or a year, it will be promoted to other places.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhuzun's Opinion on the Facsimile Reproduction of Rare Siku Quanshu Editions</h3>
<p>Recently, the Commercial Press and the Ministry of Education have discussed selecting and printing rare editions of the Siku Quanshu. Scholars at home and abroad have expressed many opinions. The reporter interviewed Professor Chen Zhuzun yesterday to ask for his opinion. Chen said that since it is named "Selecting and Printing Rare Editions of the Siku Quanshu," it should naturally be within the scope of the Siku Quanshu so that the world can see the true face of the Siku edition. If other ancient editions and good editions are selected to replace it, it should not be named "Siku." Moreover, the Commercial Press has previously reprinted the Sibu Congkan, Jigu Yicong, and issued the Hundred Na Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories. These books can be freely collected and published by scholars or merchants at home and abroad. Since they are not taken from official editions, there is no need to sign an agreement with the government or discuss them publicly. The reason for signing an agreement with the government and being subject to public discussion is precisely because it is taken from the Siku Quanshu, which is stored by the state. To abandon the Siku edition and not print it is to write an article outside the scope of the topic. As for making collation notes, it is also a matter for scholars to read books, not the responsibility of the printer. Besides, how many Ruan Wendas can be found today? If we must wait for the collation notes of each book to be completed before printing the books, I am afraid that the matter will never be completed. In my opinion, the most important thing in the facsimile reproduction of ancient books is to ensure that they are not distorted. Just like the facsimile reproduction of ancient paintings, even if there is damage or insect damage, no dots or strokes should be added arbitrarily. Therefore, even if there are wrong characters in the facsimile edition, they should not be changed, for fear that shallow people will mistakenly correct what is not wrong. Therefore, the first thing in the facsimile reproduction of ancient books is that there must be no intentional additions or alterations. The second is to prevent unintentional errors. Because the characters and strokes are not true when copying, they are often mistakenly changed when making plates. For example, the character 譌 (é) is mistaken for 共 (gòng), and the character 夫 (fū) is mistaken for 天 (tiān). This is something that we have to pay special attention to when making a facsimile. As for which books are rare and valuable, it depends on the selection of scholars, but scholars are not necessarily bibliophiles, and bibliophiles are not necessarily scholars. This is something that should also be known.</p>

Under the item of temporary expenses for the fiscal year of the 22nd year, only 50,000 yuan was listed for the National Games expenses, which is a huge difference from the estimated actual expenditure.

<h3>靑光今日凱旋</h3>
<p>Last night, they only won by one point against Qianghua, with a score of 36 to 35.</p>
<p>The Qianghua basketball team also lost to the Nanjing Qingguang team by a single point yesterday.</p>
<p>The score was thirty-five to thirty-six. It is unknown if the result would have been the opposite had Qianghua put Zha Wen-kui in earlier. It is noted that Qingguang has won all four matches in Shanghai, and their momentum is at its peak. Now that the competition is over, the team is scheduled to triumphantly return to Nanjing today. From beginning to end, the situation was unusually tense. After Qianghua took the lead with six to five, Qingguang's momentum suddenly turned, and they scored repeatedly, taking a sixteen to eight lead in the first half. All eight points scored by Qianghua were made by Cheng Jingxing alone. Starting in the second half, Qingguang's Wei Haiqing scored three consecutive baskets. Qianghua suffered this blow and tried hard to counterattack, showing great skill. The score gradually approached, leaping to twenty to twenty-two, with Qianghua only trailing by two points. The situation became increasingly tense, and the competition became more intense. Later, the score was once twenty-six to twenty-five, but Qianghua failed to overcome the one-point difference and remained at a disadvantage. Finally, when the score became thirty-five to thirty-six, Qingguang was penalized for their fourth timeout, giving Qianghua an unexpected advantage, thinking it would not be difficult to score the point and tie the game. However, Cheng Jingxing missed one, and Qingguang fortunately won by one point.</p>
<p>This performance was the toughest of Qingguang's four matches in Shanghai. Wei Haiqing of the team is a former famous Shanghai player, and his prestige has not diminished today. Xian Zhuanghuai is a famous Northeast player, and Li Chunfeng is an invaluable defensive pillar. Qianghua lacked sufficient practice, and their skills inevitably became rusty. Cheng Jingxing, Wu Youliang, and Xu Wenkui were the best in the team. It is a pity that Xu entered the game in the last ten minutes; otherwise, he could have helped Qianghua turn the tide. If the team can be given this day, there is great hope for them in the upcoming city games.</p>

<h3>On a Young Couple's Suicide by Jumping into the Sea</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Breaking the Modern Trend, Choosing a Clean Suicide</p>
<p>Everything has become modernized, and suicide is no exception. Swallowing raw opium and eating match heads have become outdated ways of committing suicide. The fashionable ghosts in the city of the dead mostly commit suicide by taking tranquilizer pills—that's modernized suicide.</p>
<p>Moreover, the places where they die are mostly hotels; the ways they die are mostly after "getting drunk and staying overnight" and "inviting others to play," returning to their rooms, sleeping, and never waking up again. "The deceased's belongings mostly include several suicide notes, one of which is an apology to the hotel owner; the deceased's photos and suicide notes can be published in newspapers, spreading the news for a while. If they die in inland hotels or places lacking news material, the local newspapers almost publish a special issue for the deceased, with everything extensively publicized. After a few days, all editorials and short essays in the newspapers use this as a modernized topic; this is the authority of modernized suicide.</p>
<p>Suicide is not what the brave do. Since they have already committed suicide and sacrificed their lives, what else can't they sacrifice? Why bother the hotel owner? Why occupy the newspaper's news space with rambling words? I read a Cantonese newspaper about a young couple's suicide on the Dragon Mountain Ferry and found it much cleaner than modernized suicides.</p>
<p>The Dragon Mountain Ferry departed from Guangzhou to Hong Kong. A young Chen couple in room 11 of the Western restaurant spoke the Chaozhou dialect. The man wore a thin woolen suit, and the woman wore a fashionable cheongsam. They had bought round-trip tickets the night before, going from Hong Kong to the province and then back from the province to Hong Kong. That evening at 7:00 PM, the two went to the dining room for a meal, which cost more than five yuan. After the meal, they returned to room 11. At 8:00 PM, a waiter from the Western restaurant entered the room to collect the bill but found no one there. The waiter assumed they had gone out for a walk and thought nothing of it. Around 9:00 PM, he entered the room again and still found no one. So he inspected the room and found a note saying: "I am not leaving a suicide note and will not say anything. Leaving five yuan is to pay for the meal. You can dispose of the other items." The handwriting was very neat. Among the belongings was a leather suitcase containing clothing and five yuan in Guangdong Provincial Bank notes. As for when the couple jumped into the sea, no one witnessed it. The passengers were just guessing. They went to the Qing stream together, without burdening others with their corpses, and left banknotes, just enough for the meal. There were no modernized suicide notes, only "Saying nothing." How tragic? How free? Suicide is not what the brave do, but this kind of suicide is much cleaner than modernized suicide after all.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Calm</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>A few days ago, a very ordinary shooting case occurred in this city. A Ningbo native named Yu Agui was shot by an enemy. The detectives learned that the murderer was hiding in a house at No. 6 Huishan Road and secretly went to arrest him without making a sound. They found both the front and back doors of the house locked. When they broke in, they found no one inside, assuming that the murderer had escaped over the roof. Later, they discovered that he had jumped down from the kitchen shed and hid in the adjacent Lu Shunxing foundry. They went to the foundry and saw a Ningbo native named Xiang Xiasheng lying face down on the ground, his shoes covered in mud, which was quite suspicious. They asked the owner of the foundry, who said that he was not a worker there. So they took him to the police station. The police chief interrogated him, but Xiang resolutely denied it. When they took him to the hospital, the victim identified him as one of the murderers, and Xiang bowed his head without saying a word.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, this kind of case is too ordinary; it happens almost every day. But this murderer Xiang Zuisheng is very extraordinary, both alert and calm. The detectives went quietly, but he was able to jump down from the kitchen shed in advance and escape into the adjacent foundry, not only deceiving the detectives but also deceiving the owner of the foundry and many workers. When the detectives found out and went to the foundry, he was lying face down on the ground, and if it weren't for the "mud on his shoes," he would have deceived them again. This person's calmness is truly superior to alertness and can be called "extraordinary calm!" Because it is the instinct of bandits to want to escape when detectives come; as long as they escape quickly and hide well, that's enough. But lying on the ground and pretending to be asleep without revealing any flaws is very difficult. So although the case is ordinary, this person's calmness is extraordinary, and it is worth praising.</p>
<p>However, in today's China, calmness is extremely necessary. As a result of the advocacy of those above and the following of those below, calmness has become a habit. Bandits have their own personal needs, and this skill is even easier to practice to perfection. But even so, it feels like a desecration of calmness when bandits use it to deceive detectives. If the people of the whole country could practice it successfully and apply it to national affairs, that would make those above happy.</p>
<h3>A Preface to the Flood</h3>
<p>— Bibo</p>
<p>The rivers overflow, the waters rage, the cities are prosperous, all in vain, the sounds of a hundred sorrows break the heart, even chickens and dogs add to the misery, wandering and drifting are all prophecies, corpses float on the waves from time to time, a vast expanse of water becomes a swamp, angry waves pour into the divine land, rushing to rescue is too late, only to complain that the dikes were not repaired in peacetime. Even more so when the wind rages and the rain pours, wives and children are scattered and lost, the tragic situation is hard to describe, "even" a heart of iron would have tears "filling" their eyes, "the suffering people" suffer from frequent wars and foreign insults, climbing high to avoid disaster, few hills to shelter, in ancient times Dayu controlled the flood, passing his home three times without turning back, manual labor was not considered, benefiting the people and the country was the early plan, daring to hope that such a saint would be born in this world, but hoping that the donations would be rewarded, it is hateful that preventing the river "is difficult" than preventing the mouth, not first dredging the river "but" drawing the firewood from under the pot, the lives of the fish in the pond are attacked by disaster, who is the enemy who destroys their homes, who can restrain the raging waves that have already fallen, a long sigh does not pursue, "now is" the time to settle life and death, relief is urgently needed for clothing and food, "I urge my compatriots" to cherish kindness and help as much as they can, the scars are in my arms and I worry about people's worries,</p>
<p>If talking about cause and effect is too clichéd, "then talking about human love should also" be eager to rotate and not linger, "don't blame the storyteller" for chewing his tongue for no reason.</p>
<p>This opening has been broadcast on the Huadong Radio Station by the famous ballad singer Song Chen Ruilin.</p>
<h3>Confucius Talks About Mahjong</h3>
<p>— Pinshan</p>
<p>Zai Yu, Zi Huang, and Zi Xia are one player short. Purchased from Confucius. Confucius was pleased and said, "Mahjong is a small matter, but it has its merits. I have been talking about it for a long time. Even though you two or three gentlemen did not ask, I will still teach you." At the end of the game, Confucius won a great victory. Zi Gong asked, "Does mahjong also have a Dao? I am not clever. I wish to hear your teachings." Confucius said, "The Dao of mahjong can be summarized in one sentence: harmony is the most important thing, the small and the big depend on it, and knowing harmony and harmonizing should be done with etiquette. Therefore, a gentleman does not fight, but if he fights, he will surely win." Yan Yuan heard this and sighed, "The wisdom of the Master is truly unattainable!"</p>

<h3>The Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Having a Family is Difficult, Hesitating and Worrying about the Future, Gathering with Friends and Shamefully Recalling the Past</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang just smiled and said in a low voice, "You said you wouldn't joke, you wouldn't joke, how come you're joking again?" Tian Qing smiled at Manying and said, "You're not sitting in the right place, come sit over here with me." As he spoke, he patted a square stool next to him repeatedly with his hand. Manying glanced at the people and said, "Are you making fun of me, or what?" Zhao Ziqiang also laughed and said, "Look, even Ms. Huang is unhappy with you." Manying stood up and said, "If you say that, I'm going to sit over there, see what happens?" Guizhi quickly grabbed Manying's clothes and laughed, "Why move when you're sitting so well?" Manying said, "Ms. Yang, are you being reasonable or not?" Guizhi said, "How am I being unreasonable?" Manying said, "Since you're being reasonable, I can sit wherever I want, that's my freedom, why are you interfering with me?" As she said this, she remained standing, unwilling to sit down. Guizhi threw up her hands and said, "If you want to move, then move, I'm not afraid." Manying wasn't afraid of him getting angry. She moved her cup of hot cocoa to the other side first, and then she sat over there herself. Guizhi lowered her head but glared at her with the corner of her eye. Manying didn't mind at all and smiled slightly. Tian Qing nudged Zhao Ziqiang and said, "Old Zhao! Say something!" Zhao Ziqiang took out a handkerchief from his pocket and kept wiping the sweat from his forehead. Tian Qing sighed and said, "You're really useless!" Zhao Ziqiang said in a low voice, "Don't joke around." Tian Qing said, "Even if you can't talk, can't you even entertain guests? Come, come, let me entertain them for you first." Just then, the waiter brought in several bowls of yuanxiao and placed them on one end of the table. (180)</p>
<p>Whereabouts</p>
<h3>Rural Life in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>— Hu Juju</p>
<p>Having idled away many years, this past Sunday was finally the most memorable. We should thank Zhou Shixun, the “Happy Immortal,” for bestowing this kind of outing upon us, which might even prolong our lives.</p>
<p>Speaking of Shixun, among our friends, he is recognized as the happiest. He has two nicknames that suit the seasons: in winter, he’s called "Café Owner," and in summer, "Yuyuan Road Inspector." From these two elegant titles, one can see a general picture of his life. The most troublesome thing about him is his oily mouth, which never stops moving for a minute, except when he's asleep. But when he does speak, every word he utters makes everyone burst into laughter. Therefore, I added the title "Tiger's Mouth" to his oily mouth. In public conversations, it's difficult for anyone to escape his "Tiger's Mouth." Because of his “happiness” and talkativeness, friends always remember Shixun when planning outings. Without him, it would be dull and uninteresting.</p>
<p>Recently, his life has undergone a small change. He has shifted from "urban" to "rural." "Zhapu," "Jiangwan," or "Gaoqiao" and "Donggou" have all been unceremoniously regarded by him as his own paradise, proclaiming himself as one of the part-owners.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, he made an appointment with me in advance, along with Shen Hengzhuang and Zhang Qiuxin, deciding to spend this Sunday in rural life. On that day, early in the morning, the three of us were "expelled" from the city by Shixun with gentle persuasion, walking along the Jiangwan Road, faintly marked with bloodstains, to Jiangwan. We were extremely tired along the way, but fortunately, among the four of us, we had this "pocket-sized" golden tongue, so we didn't feel bored.</p>
<p>Arriving in Jiangwan, we rested our feet at Wanxiangpu, which is the garden of Mr. Wang Zhongheng, Shixun's father-in-law. Although the land is not very vast, with several acres of fertile fields and a thatched cottage, it felt quiet and peaceful, at least isolated from the noise of the city. Moreover, the garden is adorned with chickens and dogs, fully revealing the flavor of rural life. At this time, compared to the farmers and villagers, the four of us felt our own worldliness. So Shixun ordered everyone to shed their worldly clothes, and at the same time, everyone took up their respective farming tools, putting away their armor and returning to the fields, trying out the life of farming. It was probably just a one-time thing, but we felt extremely happy.</p>
<p>After working, the gardener, Xiaomao, brought up a large amount of cooked corn. We also gathered fallen flowers together, spreading them on the grass and sitting on them. Shixun said, "This is a flower carpet," which was very elegant. Qiuxin loved eating vegetables and fruits the most, and Qiuxin ate half of the total amount of corn from the large plate.</p>
<p>After finishing the meal, led by Xiaomao, we brought our own pre-Qingming tea and went to a small teahouse in the town to drink tea. This teahouse is called "Jiangyuan," and it is the leading tea garden in Jiangwan. The exterior is extremely ugly, but inside, there is an elegant room, which is a gathering place for the local gentry. Because of the timing not conflicting, we were honored to be guests. Shen Hengzhuang liked to drink, and suddenly he had the urge to have beer, entrusting Xiaomao to get it for him. As a result, after an hour of searching, there was only one bottle in the whole town. So Qiuxin and I withdrew, and Shixun and Hengzhuang drank together. The two of us borrowed a set of chess pieces to play chess. Unfortunately, the two of us didn't have beards, otherwise we would have stroked them as we walked, which would have been truly antique. After finishing the wine and the chess game, it was evening. The little sparrows had already gathered in pairs and returned to their nests. We were not yet satisfied, so we went back to the garden and picked some purple grapes to quench our thirst, eating almost all the grapes on one trellis before we felt refreshed. Then we prepared to return to the city. Before leaving, Shixun borrowed flowers to present to each person a pot of autumn colors. This was originally a good thing, but strangely, the purple-orchid colored leaves had green edges. Shixun said, "This country girl has been infected with urban modernity," which was also quite interesting.</p>
<p>Returning to the North Station, it was past seven o'clock. We parted ways and hurried home. Although this was a small separation from our wives, it suddenly reminded us of the loneliness of the women at home. So everyone returned like an arrow, without discussion, getting on two-wheeled vehicles and heading home, far away from the countryside.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Throwing Stinky Stuff</h3>
<p>— Xu Mao</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Dafu's "Biographical Literature," I want to talk about another kind of "biography" 丨丨 but not "literature." Looking at the current market, besides those "self-singing and self-praising autobiographies and plagiarized critical biographies," there are also popular texts such as anecdotes and secret records. These authors often capture facts that are only shadows of reality, or fabricate rumors that have no basis at all, using human curiosity and claiming to have secret knowledge, so they often win a large readership. The origin of this school of thought comes from previous unofficial histories. A group of old-fashioned literati in Shanghai used it extensively, not only as a source of conversation after tea and wine, but also as a means of coercion and slander. Now, a group of new-style literati in Shanghai are using it even more sharply as a tool to achieve certain goals. Therefore, although this is not "literature," it does have the flavor of "the art of weaponry."</p>
<p>Saying it's a weapon is actually still not right, because if it were a weapon, then one side should be Huyan Zhuo's chain horses, and the other side should be Xu Ning's hooked sickle spears; one side should be the Jin people's wolf-toothed clubs, and the other side should be the Song people's heavenly spirit caps. But now it's not like that. People are originally unarmed, and since you can't add any charges to them, but you want to attack them, what should you do? You can only "throw stinky stuff."</p>
<p>The two methods of revealing private matters or fabricating rumors are what the people of Shaoxing call "throwing stinky stuff." "Liao" means fertilizer.</p>
<p>Throwing fertilizer on the enemy makes third parties hate the enemy's stench. This is exactly the same as the ingenuity of the manufacturers of current anecdotes and secret records.</p>
<p>A brave warrior with extraordinary courage can still risk his life to resist for a while when encountering a hooked sickle spear or a wolf-toothed club, even if he is empty-handed. But if the opponent uses "stinky stuff," then no matter how brave he is, he can only quietly retreat. It is not surprising that the "stinky stuff" literati can be proud for a while.</p>
<h3>From "Place to Use One's Talents" to "Environment"</h3>
<p>— Suo Yuan</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Qian Gechuan's article the day before yesterday, I deeply sympathize with the distress of Mr. Qian and others, who feel that "the environment does not allow us to completely abandon English" and "have to" do the "85 Movement." Therefore, I regret my meddling. If Mr. Qian and others had declared their "environment" earlier, I would never have dared to criticize them rashly. But since I have received a reply, and before the "scholars of the whole country" come to "answer on behalf of" Mr. Qian and others, I have to talk to Mr. Qian again.</p>
<p>The predecessors point out two very important points in Mr. Qian's article: ㈠ Basic English is not an international language. Zhang Menglin's "English 85 Movement and Basic English," two. The words of the originator Ogden quoted therein, three. Basic English's "Introduction" and "Grammar" two books, as well as the advertisements for Basic English published in various magazines and newspapers, all declare that Basic English is an international language. But now Mr. Qian declares that Basic English is only "seeking a simple shortcut within the scope of English." Because it is a "shortcut" "within the scope of English," it is definitely not a rationalization plan for English that can stand side by side with English and replace it, let alone be a higher-level (level in the development stage of language) international language. It is already very obvious. So it is just a kind of English learning method, or "shortcut," that is inseparable from the original English.</p>
<p>(Two) "Each has its strengths and weaknesses, each has its own field." In Mr. Zhang Menglin's article, the crimes of Esperanto have been determined: one. It is "artificial, a dead thing," two. Learning it "is equal to learning another foreign language," three. "Moreover, it has no motherland, that is, even if you learn it, there is no place to use your talents," "so it cannot be called upon." But now Mr. Qian declares: "Esperanto and English each have their strengths and weaknesses, each has its own field," "I have not opposed Esperanto because I have learned English." Here, Mr. Qian has confirmed the existence of Esperanto, expressing "not" "opposing" it, and believes that the two are "not only non-invasive to each other, but also can be learned concurrently."</p>
<p>In general, I agree with the above two points. Below, I will list a few points that I cannot agree with and answer them:</p>
<p>㈠ Mr. Qian said: "I think Esperanto comrades will certainly not attack English because they have learned Esperanto." My reply: In my articles and the articles criticizing Basic English that I have read (The Analects, Tao Sheng, Peiping World Daily, Shanghai Morning Post), no one has ever made half a word of attack on English itself. What I oppose is: one. Basic English that attempts to be an international language ("motherland" "place to use one's talents"), two. Basic English that attempts to be a rationalization plan for English ("English Rationalization and Basic English"). Mr. Qian used the method of "switching packages" and entangled with me. But he did not answer the main points of my argument. It is said that because "there are facts that can prove it," so "I am unwilling" to "talk empty talk on paper."</p>
<p>(Two) Mr. Qian quoted my "I can't help but say it is a complete failure," attempting to imply how arbitrary I am. In fact, my original text is not as simple as quoted. I said that if Basic English is not regarded as a kind of English learning method that is inseparable from English, but attempts to be a rationalization method that can replace English, "I can't help but say it is a complete failure." And Mr. Qian also admits that it is only a "shortcut" "within the scope of English" and does not act as a language that can be independent from English. So this "complete failure" "has facts that can prove it," and there is no need for "scholars of the whole country" to "answer on behalf of" again.</p>
<p>㈢ Regarding the rationalization of English spelling, Mr. Qian, in addition to "hoping" that I "study on my own" why the Americans do it, recited a history from the "sixteenth century." In terms of spelling rationalization, Anglic is better than Basic English, needless to say. Mr. Qian did not delve into the rationalization of spelling itself, only saying that it "does not help much" hastily. My reply: Mr. Qian, let's talk about Basic English first. Anglic, why the Americans do it, let's talk about it later!</p>
<p>㈣ Regarding the rationalization of irregular verbs and the exceptions of most nouns, Mr. Qian is affirmative. "But besides artificial languages, what kind of living language is completely rational?" My reply: The failure of Basic English as a rationalization plan for English lies in its failure to artificially and consciously control the existing language. But to have Ogden create such a plan is as impossible as having Dr. Hu Shi join the volunteer army. For more than ten years, Chinese opponents of Esperanto, from Mr. Tao Menghe of the "New Youth" era to Mr. Zhang Menglin and others now, have no theory other than a few sentences they have heard: "artificial language," "dead thing," "newly created world language."</p>
<p>It's really shallow.</p>
<p>㈤ Mr. Qian finally said: "Does learning a country's language make us citizens of that country?" Naturally, learning English will not cause the skin to turn white or the hair to turn yellow, just as eating beef will not turn you into a cow. However, it also depends on the "environment." If under the power of "dollars," "gold pounds," and "the saber of the imperial army," the "environment" "does not allow" you to not engage in such language movements, it is indeed the most vicious weapon of enslavement and colonization. Therefore, Mr. Qian's words, besides intentionally or unintentionally defending the forced learning of Japanese in "Manchukuo," have no other meaning.</p>
<h3>The Ideal Characters of Writers (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>What are the characteristics of Sanin? First, Sanin has an extraordinary and astonishing discourse on sexual desire; second, he is extremely opposed to knowledge; third, he has an extremely strong physique. These points are precisely the keys that most of the Russian intellectual class in the 1880s were most troubled by. In the works of Artzybasheff, we can clearly see that he is a member of this troubled intellectual class. His troubles, 丨丨 the troubles of himself or people of the same class, resulted in him fantasizing about this freak Sanin, and even more exaggeratedly expressing it in art. This kind of fantasy is the same as the British writer Stevenson, who suffered from chronic lung disease throughout his life, excessively praising the state of health.</p>
<p>However, Artzybasheff did not succeed in the expression of his ideal character Sanin, because he lacked too much authenticity, and it was almost impossible to make people believe that it was possible to exist. Sanin, with his extraordinary explanation of sexual desire, and then as a practical proof of the theory of seducing and provoking beautiful daughters or even carnally embracing his own sister, how despicable this should be; with his antipathy to knowledge, 丨 only a moment on five hundred pages of books mentioned that he was reading, and then confirming his spirit or talkativeness, how romantic this should be; with his display of stupid physical strength, he then produced a special pair of characters to change him from being beaten with a whip to being protected by wooden oars, how meaningless this should be; even that the ending of the whole family, which many people take as a good story 丨 Sanin bravely jumped out of the train to exhale because he hated the faces of human beings on the train, how absurd this scene should be.</p>
<p>In short, Sanin is a character created in fantasy, stemming from the author's long-term suffering from his own shortcomings, and intentionally exaggerating what he considers to be an ideal character, and this character is beyond all possibilities of realization. If such a contrived thing has undergone a complete and refined artistic rendering, it may also become a typical character, deceiving later readers as a character that once actually existed (there are countless such examples in the history of literature), but unfortunately Artzybasheff's art has failed to achieve this step, and we can see his intentional contrivance everywhere.</p>
<p>From the example of Sanin, our authors can be offered a lesson, that is, it is extremely unlikely that all authors' conceptual or delusional characters will want to deceive readers into accepting them as a typical character.</p>

<h3>Seaside Night</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>In black clothes, the three of them walked on the soft, loose sand.</p>
<p>Each with different feelings, quietly walking towards the seaside 丨 the seaside with lights, the wind is not very strong, but blowing on them who have just run out of the hot like a sauna cabin, there is simply unspeakable coolness and comfort.</p>
<p>A new crescent moon had just climbed out of the seabed in the east, and the light was so faint that it was impossible to see the color, if it wasn't for the moon shadows and wave light rippling in the sea that they saw.</p>
<p>Gradually approaching the shallow beach near the sea, this is the beach that has just been washed by the tide, softer and wetter than the one they had just walked on. The wind blew in gusts, and the sound of the tide hitting the rocks and crashing on the beach was so loud and majestic that it made them shout out;</p>
<p>Chen straightened her chest and shouted loudly, Zhu stared at the sea and kept saying, "It's great, it's great!" Xin, like a little sparrow, jumped and sang the song Moon night.</p>
<p>They were so happy, like prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment suddenly escaping from prison, all the troubles and heat were gone, just throwing themselves into the embrace of nature without any worries. They didn't care about each other, just stepping forward step by step on the soft, cotton-like fine sand.</p>
<p>The entire universe was immersed in silence, and if there were no wind and the sound of the sea tides, you would simply suspect that you had entered the land of the dead and that you had become a ghost.</p>
<p>"Let's not go too far, let's just sit here and watch the sea," I don't know if Zhu was tired from walking, or if she didn't have the courage to walk in the dark, she stopped alone. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Woman (14)</h3>
<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>What about the boy? He liked her. When he was in front of her, he was lively and young. When he left her, he had no interest in anything. His heart was in turmoil. He still didn't know how to say "he loved her" to her. He didn't understand what love was.</p>
<p>She understood that he wouldn't know how to explain the love that was troubling him in his heart. She felt that the beauty in these aspects always formed a five-colored rainbow in her heart.</p>
<p>But the two became friends by chance, but they still had a misunderstanding by another chance, and finally they separated. (A very long winter.)</p>
<p>That autumn, he transferred to the science department of X University in Beijing, and she also went to Beijing and entered the second grade of the liberal arts department of XX Church University.</p>
<p>They still met. She became a seventeen-year-old girl he had seen on the coast of the South China Sea, and she had to have that boy.</p>
<p>She loved him. But because he understood that she was a daughter of an official, and from some unsubstantiated rumors, he learned some stories about this woman, he avoided her as much as possible.</p>
<p>Age also formed a barrier between the two. The woman became a person who had been jilted unexpectedly. In all kinds of indifference, she still maintained her sincerity. As for him, he was just a twenty-one-year-old boy with a strong temperament and too much simplicity. He only wanted to have an achievement in chemistry in the future and make a contribution to the country. This simplicity made him see love differently from ordinary men. In fact, he was still a child. Once he had faith, he didn't want love.</p>
<p>So, in a pile of unremarkable consecutive days, nearly a thousand days passed. The two lived very self-respectingly in a close friendship.</p>
<p>In the end, they finally broke up. The woman had already graduated and spent a year in the graduate school of that school, and he had also graduated. She understood that this matter should have a result, so she ended this matter and told him that she was preparing to go to France. The man just used the attitude he had become accustomed to in the past three years to express his agreement with what she said. He later told her that he only wanted to work as an assistant technician in an acid factory in Shanghai, save money, and then go abroad to study.</p>
<p>She told him that as long as he wanted to study, she was willing to treat him as a good friend and let her lend him some money. He said that he didn't want to study like this. This kind of studying was meaningless.</p>
<p>They said other things, and this proud and beautiful man almost completely answered the woman in the same tone.</p>
<p>After that, she didn't say anything and just prepared to leave.</p>
<p>He happened to be poisoned in the laboratory at this time.</p>
<p>Later, he was admitted to the hospital and became a permanent resident in the ward of XX Hospital. The small chair next to the patient's bed in the ward was often occupied by that woman.</p>
<p>People's temperaments are always gentler when they are sick.</p>
<p>Every day, they reviewed everything on the sea three years ago. This sea in each person's impression was brightly colored, but when the two looked at each other, they were not as innocent as before. This disease gave the woman many opportunities, so that the woman's tenderness, in various small matters, made the patient lying in the white sheets understand it and understand it.</p>
<p>(Spring, a spring with melting snow. No, the yellow leaves testify, this is not spring!)</p>

However, the foreign exchange discount price in the market was still 9 cents yesterday, and the actual situation has the potential to expand the scope.

<h3>Securities and Bond Markets May Continue to Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>丨The 96 Reorganization Has Become a Bubble丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange gradually became active. Since Mr. Lin Kanghou's talk about the 96 not being reorganized, the market's morale has softened, and with the rampant Fujian communists and the intensification of rumors, large long positions have gradually emerged, and there are also many short positions. Transactions have also increased sharply. At the opening in the morning, the various market prices were still stable, generally decreasing by about one cent each. However, due to the saying that the 96 could not be reorganized, it fell by four cents. In the second session, some retail investors sold out, and the market became even more unstable, continuing to decrease by about two cents. At the opening in the afternoon, large firms No. 5 and No. 30, etc., sold out quite a bit, and the buying firms gradually weakened. Market prices continued to decrease by one cent to four cents. Due to rumors in the market that the Fujian rebellion was intensifying, many long positions gradually emerged, and the situation was very depressed. At the close, the market price seemed to improve slightly by one or two cents because the short positions on the trading floor were slightly closed. Suddenly, there was another rumor that the 96 bill holders had requested reorganization again, so the market improved slightly again. As a result, the market price fell by about one cent to five cents, with the 96 falling by six cents. According to the market's morale, the market price may continue to decline slightly, but if there are special reasons, it may temporarily rebound. The total turnover was 10,321,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods and 3,400,500 yuan in futures combined tax. Demobilization accounted for 116 taels, the 19 Fujian Goodwill accounted for 925,000 yuan, the 20 Volume Customs accounted for 1,995,000 yuan, the 96 accounted for 2,030,000 yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Hovering</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm Report, 5th, New York Stock Market, hovering all day, because the market is controlled by a majority of frustrated long positions, unable to show an active image, and the expectation that the market can be firm after Labor Day has not been realized. The ship closed lower, and the total daily turnover was 1,250,000 shares. Although the reports of wheat from Argentina and Liverpool were rising, there was little interest from buyers, so there were few transactions and prices also fell. The South continued to hedge cotton, but there were few buyers, and most market prices fell. Cotton market activity will probably have to wait for the government's cotton production estimate report. According to private estimates, this year's cotton production is about 12,800,000 bales. The silver market was stable. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>

<p>20 Public Utility Stocks 29.88 Down 0.98</p>
<p>40 Bonds 87.16 Down 0.01</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Not Affected by the Decline in American Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, with ups and downs, but the situation is still firm, because the rumor is very prevalent in the market, saying that the factory has requested the government to maintain yarn prices, so a part of the absorption package is quite large, and the trading floor is tighter. Although American cotton has fallen, the yarn market can still support it. At the same time, the actual demand for sales is more than before, and the period is still in the peak season, so the idea of going long is stronger.</p>
<h3>Human Mark Fluctuates Slightly</h3>
<p>The human mark opened lower in the previous market, following the poor foreign cotton. Suddenly, the second and third sessions tightened, with more buyers. The near months fell by one cent, and the far months rose by one or two cents, but the shorts still did not cover. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot sales were still good, and each month rose again by 2.4 cents, with the far months falling by one cent. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 19,200 bales. Zha Xian sold 1,400 bales from Sui Long, Chunji 700 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Yichang 750 bales, and Tongxing 650 bales.

<p>Shantou 110</p>
<p>Jiangxi 60</p>
<p>Same Industry 25</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, and the situation is firm. Although American cotton has fallen, the local cotton market has not been affected. It is generally said that the business of transporting spot cotton is quite smooth, and the prices in various production areas are still flat. There are reports of rainfall in Hankou, so buyers are holding on tightly. However, the amount of short selling by the Ningbo group has not changed.</p>
<h3>Zheng Mark is Stable</h3>
<p>Zheng Mark opened lower in the previous market, following the decline of foreign cotton by two cents.

<h3>Grain Outsiders Going Long Compete to Purchase Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month showed a trend of initially softening and then stabilizing. Foreign wheat quotations were down by 5 or 6 cents in Chicago and about 1 cent in Canada, so the sentiment was tired when the market opened. The current month fell to 2.525 cents, and October fell to 2.7 cents. However, after the second session, because of the news that outsiders were going long but had not yet purchased wheat, the sentiment remained firm, so after a soft period, they rushed to buy again, and the market price rebounded by nearly one cent. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to the fatigue and rebound of the wheat market, the opening price was quite excited, 1 cent higher than the closing price in the morning. However, the second session saw a pullback due to factory selling. After the third session, because the factory did not sell, outsiders still raised the price, causing the market atmosphere to tend to rise again. As for Tianjin, it was heard that daily sales were 20,000 to 30,000, and the price was slightly lower by 1 cent compared to before. At the time of this sale, it is still not smooth, and it is inevitable that it will be a major drag on the future. As a result, the current month was 1 cent higher than the previous day, October to January was 1.5 cents higher, and February was 1.225 cents higher.</p>
<h3>Rumors Raise Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning, each month saw a period of softening, with foreign wheat quotations falling by 1 cent to 5 or 6 cents. Therefore, at the opening, the current month was 9.2 cents, October was 3 cents, and November was 1.1 cent, down by 2 or 3 cents compared to the previous day. After the entry, there was a rebound due to floating short covering. When the market opened in the afternoon, there was a rumor that the government would maintain wheat prices, causing the long side to raise prices significantly. However, the actual buying and selling in each session was not very smooth, and most of them were speculative entries and exits. As for the wheat borrowing issue, it is said to be in the works and should be revealed soon. As a result, the current month was 3 cents higher than the previous day, October was 4 cents higher, November was 4 cents higher, and December was 3 cents higher. The rest were unchanged. The spot wheat market was slightly quiet. High-quality wheat was still stable, while medium-quality was flat. Kai Zhen Tong wheat was 3.925 yuan, the second was 8.88 yuan, Yangzhou wheat was 3.7 yuan, Changzhou wheat was 3.66 yuan, Liuhe wheat was 3.667 yuan, and Hankou wheat was 3.425 yuan, totaling 3,000 bags, handled by Xinda.</p>
<h3>Views of Flour and Wheat Industry Insiders</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the relevant departments of the Central Government held a meeting on five items to maintain the wheat law. Although the details are not fully known, the morale of the city was boosted and the wheat price was pushed forward. However, according to industry insiders speaking from facts, the wheat had already been purchased, and the international telegrams were undoubtedly confirmed. At present, they are considering how to find a way out and how to distribute it to Chinese merchant factories at what market value. As for the sluggish flour sales this year, it is no accident. The main reason is the economic bankruptcy in various places. Recently, the accumulated flour in Tianjin is still slightly less than 3 million bags, and there are also 3 million bags in this city. The wheat stored in each factory can last for at least two months. Even with this amount and the actual sales in recent years, it is enough for half a year. If the wheat production in various places is included, even if foreign wheat is not scheduled, it can last until the new wheat season next year. Therefore, no matter how to provide relief, it will not be possible to escape the facts and find another way out. Because China's economic downturn is no different from the surplus overseas. It is difficult for countries with gold and yuan to break through this difficulty. Does our country have the power?</p>
<h3>Riverbank Rice Flat and Sluggish</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was more than 30, the number of retail and wholesale purchases was the same as before, with a total of more than 2,000 bags. The market shape was mediocre. The price of Changbang Su, Tongbang Nangang, and other japonica rice, as well as Du Yangjian, Qingjiao Songsi Xilian thin indica rice, etc., did not fluctuate. The price of Bi-Yuan was sluggish and soft, and the price of Yin-Yuan was still flat. Due to the slightly surging arrival of new japonica rice and new Du Yangjian from the riverbank, and due to the weather, the market price continued to be sluggish. The new Xing rice from the factory in the east was quite suitable for store purchases, and was still opened at 7 yuan. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from various routes in the riverbank was 23.4, and the purchases of various goods in the market were slightly reduced. The high-quality white japonica rice in the market was slightly tired, and the medium-quality rice was stable. Early rice, Chen Yang Du Ping Zheng, thin indica rice, and Xin Yangjian Tuanjian rice were slightly close to the ruler. Chen Kejian was stable, Xin Kejian was slightly soft, and Bi-Yuan was also slightly outside the ruler.</p>
<h3>Quanzhou Gang Buys New Ke Indica Rice Smoothly</h3>
<p>丨Foreign Rice Sales in Zhejiang Stalled丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, new Ke indica rice continued to arrive in Shanghai, especially the train goods from Ningbo. The inventory also gradually thickened. Because the cost of new Changjiang Ke indica rice was relatively high, the arrival of goods was not as crowded as Jing indica rice. The market looked small due to the large inventory and arrival of goods, but yesterday the Quanzhou gang purchased smoothly, and 5,000 bags of newly arrived Nanjing Xinji indica rice were sold, priced at 6.36 yuan to 6.25 yuan, an increase of 2 to 3 cents compared to the previous day. Because of the lively Minhua price, 488 bags of new Hunan rough Jing rice were also purchased. Hunan's harvest this year is excellent, and Hunan's officials and merchants have already cooperated and helped each other in sales. It is hoped that they will gradually arrive in the future, so the morale is very soft, and the price has already fallen by two or three cents. After the Quanzhou smooth purchase yesterday, the spot crude rice was cleared, and the market was able to stand firm. The price opened at 5.23 yuan, and the second tip was 1.14 yuan. The Yong gang has been handling and loading small purchases for several days, and the purchase has been light yesterday. Only 100 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were handled, priced at 7.36 yuan, close to the selling price of the previous day. However, the new early price was not negotiated properly and has not yet been opened. Foreign rice has been handled in 300 small purchases from this street, priced at 6.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Green Beans High-Quality Goods Gradually Decrease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for new green beans was slightly more active, with a small number of sources arriving, and high-quality aged goods gradually decreasing. Therefore, new Ming green beans with good quality have a Guanggang question, and their market trend may continue. It is estimated that more than 400 bags were traded, which were Bengbu goods, and the price opened at 5.35 yuan to 5 yuan. The market atmosphere for new Mao green beans was still sluggish. Although there were few arrivals, sales were weak. More than 200 bags were sold, and the price was 4 yuan, which was also Bengbu goods, and continued to be purchased by the Xiamen gang.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Domestic High-Quality Cotton Red Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slightly weak due to the slightly lower customs gold. The trend was flat and tired. The association's opening price for 24 coarse sand white was 21.58 yuan, and later it was 5.5 yuan, a decrease of 2 to 5 cents compared to the previous day. The high-quality P-mark for No. 20 medium sand white was 21.15 yuan, and the ordinary was 20.8 yuan. Because Xinyi opened a large batch of Dutch red the day before, the market trend was more tired. The PK mark was priced at 16.8 yuan and had not yet been traded. Taikoo sugar was down by 1 cent each. The B mark was 21.8 yuan, the CW mark was 21.7 yuan, the DY mark was 21.35 yuan, and the HX mark was 20.9 yuan. The Zhenji No. 1 cotton white produced by this factory was opened at 20.6 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were refunded at half a cent less than the previous day. More than 100 bags of Chaoqing were opened, and the price of lifting the Zhuang Qing was 1 cent, to 16.1 yuan, followed by 15.8 yuan. More than 110 bags of high-quality cotton red were opened, and the price rose to 18.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods New Longan First Trade Has Opened</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Tong'an longan and new Ma Hong had a few shipments arriving on the day before yesterday. The set prices were high. Yesterday, they were all opened as quoted. Tong'an Jikui was opened at 60 yuan, Tong'an Zhenghong was opened at 40 yuan, Zhenghao Xinma Hong was opened at 38.9 yuan, and Fuhong was opened at 23.4 yuan. Because of the small number, the prices were stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Autumn Cocoons in Jiangsu Province are of Poor Quality and Low Price</h3>
<p>Wujin Autumn Cocoons Pull 30 Yuan The autumn cocoons in the four townships of Wujin, the early silkworms in Dongxiang had the most abundant harvest, and the cocoon production of the late silkworms in Beixiang was relatively poor. Cocoon farms have been weighing for three or four days. The cocoon price in Dongxiang is the highest at 33 or 4 yuan, and the lowest in the northwest township is 25.6 yuan, averaging about 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Standard Price of Autumn Cocoons in Jiangsu Province Zhejiang autumn cocoons have superior body. The standard price of fresh cocoons is determined by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Control Committee at 40 yuan. The cocoon season in Jiangsu Province is relatively late, and the cocoon production is slightly poorer due to the weather. The discount is large, and the standard price of fresh cocoons has now been negotiated, with a high of 35 yuan.</p>
<p>Rayon Exchange Rate is Long and the Price is Tired The foreign exchange rate is long, and the price of rayon is tired. Passenger sales have risen slightly. Yesterday, the Changjiang Gang purchased 46 boxes of Ike Fa brand, original-color golden unicorn, red golden bell, and other brands for the current month's futures, priced from 180 yuan to 165.25 yuan net hit, 0.25 yuan less than the previous time.</p>
<p>European and American Silk Sales are Lifeless The New York market is lifeless due to the fall in the price of Japanese silk in Yokohama, and factory sales are even more lifeless. London silk prices are surprisingly low. The Lyon silk telegram has not changed. European and American residents in Shanghai are holding goods in their hands and no one is asking about them. They have no interest in future and spot silk. Chinese silk merchants are taking a passive attitude due to the resumption of silk factory strikes, and the market atmosphere is stagnant. Yesterday, only Yin Zhuang purchased 18 packages of yellow silk, and the price was still tired.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchant Tea Market Turns Qing</h3>
<p>Each European bank urgently needs to sort, pack, and transport the large amount of Zhenmei and Xiamei green tea purchased a few days ago for export. Therefore, they have temporarily stopped purchasing various teas in the market. Only Hua Tea, Xiehe, and other firms in the city purchased more than 900 boxes of green tea such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei, and the selling price did not change. In addition, the Tongfu Foreign Bank has slightly improved its interest in Qimen black tea, and the selling price has not risen or fallen.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Cement, and Steel Transactions are Launched</h3>
<p>The golden wind is refreshing, and the source has disappeared. The hardware market is also gradually becoming active. Various manufacturers have begun to contact each other in preparation for winter goods. It is estimated that 2,000 boxes of tinplate and Huisai iron have been ordered, and the market is better than before. It is estimated that 90 pounds per box is 16.4 yuan, 100 pounds is 17.2 yuan, and Huisai iron is 32 yuan. 18-sheet chimney iron, then the North gang bought 500 loads, priced at 11.25 yuan, 0.2 yuan less than before. English steel plate 2.5 mm is 10.05 yuan, 200 loads are opened, and 0.5 mm is 8.5 yuan, and only a hundred loads are traded. 7.5 mm is only a few dozen loads, and the buying and selling market has not changed. The Fujian gang loaded 4 or 500 barrels of Elephant brand cement, priced at 4.7 yuan per bag and 5.85 yuan per barrel (including tax). There are only a few transactions in this factory's nails, and the market is stable. In addition, various iron products are expected to develop in this cool weather.</p>
<p>Business Sutra (39)</p>
<h3>The Effects and Uses of Ginkgo</h3>
<p>Summer has passed, and cool autumn has arrived. Streets and alleys are filled with a chorus of cries, resounding in the ears: "Hot ginkgo nuts, fragrant and glutinous!" This is the cry of vendors selling so-called "hot ginkgo," a very common seasonal treat in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ginkgo refers to the kernel of the fruit produced by the ginkgo tree. The ginkgo, also known as the "grandfather-grandson tree," is a deciduous tree, five or six fathoms tall, with thin, fan-shaped leaves that have notches. In spring, it bears small, white flowers with a hint of light green. It bears fruit in early autumn. The flesh is removed to obtain the kernel, which is the ginkgo nut.</p>
<p>The naming of ginkgo is based on its inherent shape and color. When the kernel is fresh and tender, it is bright and green. After some time, it takes on a yellowish hue. It is oval in shape, with small, pointed ends, resembling an olive, but with ridges. It may have two or three ridges. Those that meet this standard are called "Buddha's Hand Fruit" and are of the highest quality. There are also those that are round, like cherries, called "Plum Fruit," which are of a relatively lower quality.</p>
<p>Ginkgo is sweet and bitter, neutral and astringent, and non-toxic. Cooked, it has the effect of warming the lungs and benefiting qi. The Compendium of Materia Medica has several applications for it. I will extract one or two as follows: (1) For facial rosacea and chapped hands and feet, chew raw ginkgo and apply the juice. (2) For frequent urination, eat fourteen ginkgo nuts, half raw and half roasted. (3) For leucorrhea, grind ten raw ginkgo nuts, mix with warm water, and swallow once a day. This is very effective. (4) For breast lumps that have ulcerated, grind half a catty (eight ounces) of ginkgo nuts, mix with wine, and drink. Grind the other half catty (eight ounces), apply as a poultice. This is effective.</p>

<h3>Another Interpretation of "Poverty," "Stealing," and "Robbing"</h3>
<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>丨Written after reading Mr. Yin's "Stealing" and "Robbing"丨 "Stealing and robbing" are not "human" "instincts," but "poverty" can indeed "ignite passionate and upward-moving emotions." This was stated very clearly and thoroughly in Mr. Yin's article "Stealing and Robbing" in this journal on August 31, 1933. In the end, it even strongly cited "World Revolutionary Literary Giant Gorky" as hard evidence. Originally, I could have "remained silent" about this. The reason I didn't "remain silent" is that I still felt there were a few "different points," and the purpose is to hopefully reach more, and at the same time, more thorough and clear conclusions. Therefore, the writing of this article is definitely not an intentional attack or meaningless rebuttal.</p>
<p>"Suicide" is the act of "the weak," and I absolutely "do not deny" this. However, I cannot "despise" it like Mr. Yin because I believe this is the inevitable result of the deformed development of society. At the same time, it is also a helpless and "tragic" way to "escape" from "poverty." Therefore, I only feel sympathy and regret for these many victims and try my best to provide relief and active assistance to reduce this "tragic" phenomenon. Eight or nine out of ten reasons for "suicide" are because of "poverty," and "poverty" has now almost become a "universal disease"! In Mr. Yin's view, "poor people" must "endure hardship," and only after going through the stage of "poverty" can they achieve "permanent, great, and genuine creation." There seems to be a similar saying in our ancient proverbs: "Endure the bitterness of bitterness to become a man above men." However, the reality tells us that many people who have lived a life of "hardship" in peace and poverty still fail to become "men above men"! Therefore, I cannot help but feel suspicious about "poverty." Now, I am even more suspicious of whether "World Revolutionary Literary Giant Gorky," who "survived countless struggles in the waves of poverty and finally succeeded," is just one of the lucky few among millions of "poor people"?</p>
<p>As for "robbing" and "stealing," my understanding is not as narrow as Mr. Yin's. Because if someone truly becomes a thief or robber due to "poverty" to "steal" or "rob," then not only is there "no hope of warmth, food, and enjoyment," but also, because this is a criminal act, there is the danger of "detention," "imprisonment," and even being "shot." This is the act of a "poor wretch" and should be "punished."</p>
<p>My so-called "stealing" and "robbing" are actually the principles of struggle, progress, practical, and creation that Mr. Yin speaks of. "Stealing" is other people's methods, like the Japanese's ability to imitate and copy... "Robbing" is other people's interests, like capitalist countries plundering the possessions of small and weak nations. Such "stealing" and "robbing" can be as big as possible because only broad and planned "stealing" and "robbing" can be a "raging fire," can "ignite passionate and upward-moving emotions," and can further become "permanent, great, and genuine creation," which is the true way out for "poor people." Therefore, I firmly believe that "stealing" and "robbing" are "human" "instincts."</p>
<h3>Autumn Brings Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>On an autumn evening, August 30th, the half-moon was slowly climbing up the eastern grape trellis. The rustling leaves of the parasol tree were constantly struck by the wind, falling to the ground, and from the grass pile at the foot of the wall, autumn insects were singing a tragic battle song as if they were going mad. On a thin layer of withered yellow and slightly red parasol leaves, the moonlight reflected two closely intertwined slender figures. At the same time, in the still air, weak, subtle conversations drifted from the grape trellis.</p>
<p>"Sister Ling, I'm leaving for sure tomorrow. I have to leave her. But..." I turned my back to her face, feeling so sad that I almost shed tears as I spoke to her.</p>
<p>"Younger brother Hui, parting may be the most painful thing, but for the sake of everything for you, you should still go! I believe the world won't be as cruel as you imagine. You can find someone to comfort you anywhere. Besides, your mission is calling you to reach out to all the people in the world!" She turned my head around like a loving mother and said kindly.</p>
<p>Her kindness and dignity made me believe in her sublimity and greatness even more. We talked intimately under the bright moonlight. We talked about our past, present, and future. When I thought of the uncertain wandering in the future, I felt lost. I said:</p>
<p>"Sister Ling, how will I struggle in an environment that I have never lived in before?"</p>
<p>"Younger brother Hui, why are you so worried? You will know how important your lifelong responsibility is! So, what does our temporary separation count for?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"What, are you crying? This is a trick played by idle women! Don't be silly anymore. Lift your head up and show some courage, younger brother Hui!" We talked and talked until the autumn night wind brought a chill.</p>
<p>This was an autumn night of parting last year. But how quickly time flies! Drifting in S Province...</p>
