<h3>國聯已臨最嚴重關頭十九特委會明日開會</h3>
<p>主席希孟抵日内瓦繼續調解工作</p>
<p>新妥協案完全徇日意旨難成事實</p>
<p>大會將根據盟約擬具報吿</p>
<p>我代表與國聯有相當接洽</p>
<p>（南京）外交界息、國聯於調解絕望後、曾經醖釀新妥協計劃、因日堅持承認僞組織與直接交涉、爲我所極端反對、故大會仍將根據盟約第十五條第四項草擬報吿書、内容完全以李頓報吿書爲基礎、我顔顧郭三代表已與國聯有相當接洽、十六日十九國特委會開會後、如公認調解絕望、即提出報吿書、經多數通過後、再提國聯十會討論、國際空氣已臨最嚴重關頭、（十四日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）外部頃接顔顧郭等電吿、國聯特委會爲恐中日爭端無法調解、已着手起草報吿、根據盟約第十五條第四節、採用李頓報吿書前八章、及最近數月來中日間所發生之新事實爲基礎、並爲適當之建議、顔顧等電中對該報吿、詳述内容、向政府請示應付態度、其内容尙未便發表、政府致顔顧等復訓、預定在十六日十九國特委會開會前發出、據外部發言人談、國聯形勢甚爲緊張、特委會主席希孟及秘書長特魯蒙連日勸中日代表團接洽確有重大之醖釀、預定十六日開會、先聽取中日雙方代表之申述、次即將能否調解問題提出討論、如認爲已無調解可能、則須提出報吿、實行第十五條第四節爲有力之制裁、（十四日專電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表與國聯秘書長德魯蒙間刻正進行談判、以期謀取關於可爲日本接受的十九特委會議案之方案、現已有趨向折衷辦法之若干進步、其致此進步之一部原因、爲理由說明書形式之更改、（十三日路透電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）國聯大會非常會議主席希孟氏今晚抵此、故遠東事件之調解工作、即將開始、希氏不久即將訪問中日雙方代表團、探訪兩國政府對於十九國委員會所草就之决議案、究竟有無接收之可能、然後再定進止之方針云、但依現狀觀之、此種决議案中、雙方均無接收之可能、故希孟或將再與十九國委員會討論人各重要原則、以定將何進行之方、十九國委員會將於星期一日重集、討論原有决議案是否將堅持到底、抑將加以更變而求調解之成立、但以近日遠東事變已發生極大之變化、國聯方面殆莫不懷疑於國聯本身解决滿洲案件之能力也、（十三日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日方所傳新妥協案内容</h3>
<p>組織五國委員會進行調解</p>
<p>對不承認僞組織完全抹煞</p>
<p>邀請美俄參加無明白規定</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表團十三日下午三時再開首腦部會議杉村次長報吿與特魯蒙交涉之結果後、各人交換意見、决定報吿外務省並請訓令、據聞杉村與特魯蒙成立諒解之點如下、㈠調解委員會之組織、限於英法德意比五國、中日兩國不參加、㈡邀請美俄問題不取消、但不使用「美俄」等明瞭文字、唯表示「與中日問題有利害關係之會員國及非會員國」、而將來邀請美俄、㈢不使用「直接交涉」之字句、但認直接交涉之精神、調解委員會以援助中日紛爭之根本的澈底的解决爲其權限、</p>
<p>㈣理由　問題、完全捨棄理由書之形式、作爲議長之宣言、故理由　最後段否認「滿洲國」之字句决定削除、㈤國聯大會繼續至解决中日問題時期爲止、調解委員會於必要時報吿大會、以表示國聯與中日問題有完全關係、（十三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）國聯事務局案之全文、今晨達外務省、其内容如下、</p>
<p>每一决議案、第一項、國聯若根據盟約第十五條之規定、其第　任務係在努力調解紛爭、而今日之事態、表示尚未達勸吿含有關於紛爭之事實與解决案之時期、第二項、依一九三二年三月十一日之决議、聲明關於本件國聯之原則、故鑑於第三項之李頓調查團報吿卆第九章之原則、作爲解决本件之有力基礎、第四項、該原則於遠東事態之進展、有决定適用與否之任務、故第五項爲調節該紛爭計、由十九國委員會任命小委員會、第六項、爲决定的解决兩國之懸案、由該小委員會扶助兩當事國、并認該小委員會爲遂其使命、有採取一切必要措置之權限、有邀請非會員國代表參加之權能、第七項、該小委員會對該事於三月一日前、應將情報絡續供給十九國委員會、俾十九國委員會得報吿大會、第八項、十九國委員會依據一九三二年七月之决議所表明之猶豫期間、有得兩當事國之同意、决定之權能、該猶豫期間若無兩當事國之同意時、十九國特别委員會於盟約第十五條第三項、將大會所委托之事業爲最終報吿之際、應提示於國聯大會、第九項、國聯大會依然繼續議長認必要時得召集之、第二决議案、國聯大會對於國聯調查委員、感謝其與國聯以有益之援助、爰宣言調查團報吿書對於國聯努力於維持和平、爲有益之貢獻、（十四日電通社電）</p>
<h3>我代表團致國聯會節略</h3>
<p>因日軍佔榆所引起之衝突</p>
<p>聲明中國不負責任</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國代表團將一月十一日中國政府分致一九零一年議定書（按即辛丑條約）簽字各國之節略全文、備函送達國聯會秘書處、謂日本濫用一九零一年議定書所載之特權、日本軍隊攻擊山海關而佔領之、并屠殺無辜居民數千人、而毁壞城内外之財産甚衆、日本軍隊又集中於山海關之四週、及北寗鐵路一帶、在此情勢之下、中國不得不宣言、謂中國軍隊對於日本軍隊之侵略行爲而行使正當防衛權、其因此而發生在法理上或在事實上之事變、絕不擔負何項責任云、國聯會秘書處已從中國代表團之請、將此函分送非常大會各會員國矣、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>日本表示樂觀</h3>
<p>（東京）國聯對日妥協案、目下已在日外部審議中、如日外部表示同意、則由希孟主席報吿經過、並宣讀主席之聲明書、結果十九國委員會、將中日紛爭移交五國會議、日本如再要求修改枝葉問題、則須待十六日之會議暂停後希孟與特魯蒙磋商以後再修故、不過要提交十九國特委會審議而决定、設若日本要求根本修改、則國聯不能不援用十五條第四項强制調解中日紛爭、聞日外部對此認爲國聯已屈服日本、對前途頗抱樂觀、（十四日華聯電）</p>
<h3>日政府堅持直接交涉反對第三者干預</h3>
<p>（東京）日政府對於特魯蒙秘書長關於解决中日問題辦法應取態度、現由外務省首腦部愼重協議中、該案内容相當接近日本主張、然日方擬要求制限監視中日事件新委員會之權限、並　如下方針、與特魯蒙繼續談判、㈠特魯蒙案規定新委員會討論事項、爲李頓報吿書之第九章諸項、其任務殊缺明瞭、且有諾許滿洲自治一節、日本當然不能承認、故要求改修爲新委員會討論第九章中有益之部分、㈡如成文中不便明記右項條件、則應明確規定委員會實際的工作、不根據於上項條件、㈢邀請非會員國問題、在决議中亦有矛盾之點、即决議案規定小委員會根據於盟約第十五條第三項行動、然如加　美俄兩國、則國聯將越帮助中日直接交涉之義務範圍、而不免先　部分互相矛盾、故須取消此點、㈣特魯蒙親提議新委員提用李頓報吿書原則於遠東事態、此與某前章所謂之尊重中日直接交涉一節、發生矛盾、故其適用或解釋等、應</p>

<h3>西班牙撤換出度國聯代表唯恐開罪日本</h3>
<p>瑪德里　西班牙政府今日發表、馬達利亞加因病不能赴日内瓦、派薛拉代表西班牙出席十九國委員會與國聯大會特别會議、討論滿案、據稱、馬達利亞加前患感冒頗重、現已漸痊、方在法國里維拉養病、但據可靠方面傳出、西班牙代表之因病易人、猶屬託辭、實因西政府不慊於馬氏上次在日内瓦有逾越職權行爲所致、且聞外長蘇路泰稍緩或將親赴日内瓦一行云、（十三日國民電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）據日代表部之情報、依事務間案所設小委員會之構成、現悉德魯蒙秘書長於英法意德比五國外、要求美國之參加、而不使中日兩國加入、并最希望美國之參加、日主張者係英國、其理由係英國於遠東有多數之殖民地、於遠東政策上、謂與美國之提携、爲緊要不可或缺者、但日本政府對之、以爲美國之參加、對於盟約毫無責任之非會員國加入國聯之機關、與以發言權而使不負責任、在國聯之法理上不僅有疑義、且於實際的影響、徒助長中國以夷制夷之不當精神、使問題之和平解决困難遷延、故表明絕對的不同意、故問題今後脫離日本之對國聯而爲英日間之問題、故其進行殊堪注目、（十四日電通社電）</p>
<h3>滬戰中英法對日密約允不干涉東省問題</h3>
<p>又一件國際詭詐行爲</p>
<p>歐戰中曾經有過先例</p>
<p>世界社譯密勒評論報云、據日内瓦傳出消息、當日軍從上海撤退之時、英法曾秘密允許日本、對於滿洲問題不加干涉、此項消息是否確實、不能斷定、但就過去之事情比例推測、則此舉似有充分之可能性、而足使每一關心此問題之人加以注意也、按據傳說、英法顯然因彼等在上海具有巨大利益、而日本之攻擊、使此等利益大受損失、故情願允許日本、倘日本退出上海、即許彼在滿洲自由行動、此項傳說頗覺可信、何以故、因在大戰中亦曾發生一種同樣之無信義的詭詐運動故也、當時歐戰諸國連英法在内、秘密允許日本、倘日本能援助各該國打倒德國、則許其佔有山東、以作酬報、此等秘約之奸詐無信、泃達於極點、蓋當其締立之時、正爲歐洲諸國及美國盡力勸誘中國對德宣戰之時也、如是歐洲諸國伸一手與中國結好、而另伸一手剚中國之背、美國當時以光明態度對德開戰、絕不知歐洲諸國與日本締有密約、許其佔據山東、此乃與美國政策絕對相違者也、直至威爾遜趙統到凡爾塞、從事媾和之談判、於是關於日佔山東之各種卑汚條約、始一一　　因此中國拒絕簽字於和約、美國亦然、就上述之背景觀之、今日某某歐洲國有與日本密結關於滿洲之約之說、頗屬可信、而中國與論之憤慨、自不足怪也、</p>
<h3>英保守黨袒日態度鮮明</h3>
<p>（倫敦）保守黨人士對於中日爭端、仍持保留態度、一遇機會、又欲促使中日兩國相接近、泰晤士報今日社論談滿洲問題、即希望中日爭端、不擴大至中國本部、該報謂日本無論如何必欲以武力占據滿洲、吾人考慮滿洲問題、不當向何者合乎公理、何者不合公理、日本在滿軍人皆靜觀熱河主席湯玉麟之態度、日本軍人主張設立中立區域、由多方觀之、甚爲可採、蓋中立區域之法、固可推行於世界其他地方、日本之計劃、可認爲妥協精神之表現、該報又謂、在現在情形之下、欲取得一種妥協、將爭端中各項問題即時解决、恐不可能、最好之法、莫如將種種困難逐漸排除、困難旣能逐漸排除、則中日兩國心理亦可逐漸調和、以故吾以爲張學良因山海關事性對於日本就地解决之提議、不無贊同之意、匪獨在重要之點、使人安心、且可造成一種良好之榜樣云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>之餘地乎、中日爭端日趨嚴重、吾人深爲憂慮、吾人謹以國聯會名義、先作緩和人心之計、繼則努力調解、而不斷引用國聯會盟約、吾人所言者、無一非盟約之規定、而盟約之全部規定、吾人未嘗不充分援用之也」彭古詞畢、衆院决定對此項質問案延期討論、至下午七時十五分鐘、宣吿散會、（十三日哈瓦斯電）（</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>菲利濱獨立被否定　晦</h3>
<p>㈠日美關係惡化</p>
<p>本平洋風雲日趨緊急。盡人皆知。乃以美總統改選。本年三月四日之後。白宮將易新主。美之對外政策。不能全無變更。不過北美合衆國特其全國之力。物産之豐富。世界第一次大戰而後。穩執世界金融之牛耳。然自一九二九年秋季經濟恐慌爆發以來。日趨深刻。迄乎去年六月後。總統競選期中。始見轉機。遂羣相欣慶。以爲恐慌已至極底。而今而後。將漸次繁榮。矣惟美利堅繁榮所擊在歐洲。在加拿大。在南美各國。然而歐洲各國戰債未清。亦不願久在金圓支配之下。加拿大爲大英帝國經濟聯盟之一員。豈不欲脫離美國之經濟牽制。南美則動亂不息。金圓投資且受打擊。今後美國之理想市塲。厥爲列强環伺下之中國。然彼在中國無經濟的特殊根基。亦無軍事的根據。欲圖經濟勢力之鞏固。在鞏固中求發展。其勢豈可能乎。然美國對華貿易。去年年底作一年總結。對華輸出計二億五千零二十七萬六千海關兩。除英印香港合計而外實居我國輸入各國中之首位。是故縱不能以兵力維護其在華經濟利益。其於遠東固有之軍事支撑點。亦决不肯輕於放棄也。</p>
<p>民主黨爲實踐其政治的諾言。主張菲列濱提早獨立案。經美國會决議。據十三日美總統致國會敎書中。有『深信獨立之菲利濱國家。將無力抵抗遠東民族之武力侵犯或和平移民』。又謂『此案不切合實際。在經濟方面旣不健全。自國際立塲觀察。尤爲危險』。則是所謂「武力侵犯」者。更指明爲「遠東民族之武力侵犯」。現時之遠東能用武力。且專恃其武力以侵犯他民族者。除日本帝國主義外别無第二國。此語至明。美國之態度。亦由此可見矣。</p>
<p>㈡日本積極進戰美將無容足地</p>
<p>日本旣以武力侵占東北三省。收黑河流域（遠東穀倉）於其掌握中設使滿洲開發而盡如意。則窮乏之日本。將具備充分作戰能力。中國市塲西太平洋之支配地位。即屬於日本。蓋彼握形勢之便。復有物力資助也。近且積極侵略華北。欲一舉而解决其纖維工業所必需之原料丨棉花羊毛問題。日本乘世界經濟恐慌尙未復原。美國方焦急於其國内經濟復興之際。乃徵兵買馬。召集全國師團長及步騎飛行各聯隊長。輜重兵重砲兵各獨立大隊長。二百六十餘名。舉行秘密會議。實行軍備大改革。海軍方面亦徵調各式艦艇。自無畏式戰鬥艦新式尖銳巡洋艦潛水艦飛行母艦等等海軍全部動員自南洋加洛林羣島。小笠原羣島。北至橫須賀。西迄澎湖列島。作空前未有之海軍大演習。其意何居目的何在。固不待乎專家而後知其標的之在　美也</p>
<p>美國旣已盛極一時。惟欲持盈保泰。維護其現時地位。恢復其已往繁榮而已。豈料日本着着緊逼。旣得東北三省。肆意獨占。於「華北市塲」更欲處絕對的支配地位。使現時華北變爲九一八事變前之滿洲。然後盡量發揮其大陸政策。囊括東亞。即以現狀而論。西太平洋覇權。已入於日本之手。</p>
<p>美國在遠東僅有之亞細亞艦隊。惟一萬巡洋艦一隻。航空母艦一隻。驅逐艦十九隻。砲艦十二隻潛水艦十二隻。水雷母艦潛水母艦各一。此外尙有掃　艇五艘。而陸軍一萬一千。士兵六千七百。飛機二百五十架。此區區兵力。一旦外敵來侵。縱令有優秀之防禦工事。亦僅能支撑少許時日。欲圖維護在華之優越地位。擴大其市塲。殊屬難於勝任。是以去年以來。即集中海軍艦隊全力於太平洋上。事實昭示。非必有挑戰之决心。不過防備日本侵略於萬一。欲竭力保持其太平洋西岸經濟的優勢而已。然日本之力未可輕侮。且又厚結英國。以圖分割東亞。此景此情。豈今日美國所能堪。美國欲爭太平洋覇權者。匪特對菲利濱海軍根據不肯放棄。任其獨立。恐尙將加緊其防禦工程。於關島要塞。亦將重建。則今日否定菲島獨立案乃其「抵抗：：武力侵略：」之序幕。。未來太平洋大戰之先聲也。</p>

<p>春秋紫羅蘭盦談薈  瘦鵑　　葉楚傖先生本來也是望平街上人，自從革命成功，他當了中央委員，就好多年沒有見他了，連他那種「蒙邊鳴筑記」「古戍寒笳記」一類的的悲壯激越的好小說也從此不能再見，這眞是文藝界上一個絕大的損失｜記行他當年專任民國日報總主筆時，有一天前去瞧他。見他赤着脚趿着鞋；穿着短衣，一面喝酒吃花生米；一面走筆做文章，落拓不覊的，完全是名士本色。不知道他這幾年來一行作吏，已改變了態度沒有？先生的小說旣做得好，吟詩塡詞也是老斷輪手。自新文化潮流激盪全國以後，他偶然興到，也弄弄新標點；做做新體詩，在新文壇上一露頭角。畢竟是舊文學的根柢打得好，所以做起新體詩來，也自不同凡俗。我最愛他的「回周莊途中所見」三首：　　㈠船頭風來篷脚轉，下篷拉綫各上岸，繹夫拉船如拉車，可笑坐船人，緣何不上岸。　　㈡打壞泥　逿，泥衣泥裙泥鞋襪，頭髮未梳，誰家女子？趁清早無人，唱村歌：「郎啊！」　　㈢江水南如箭，江岸接如線，霧非霧，烟非烟晚來何處人聲，使人依變。　　先生姓葉，單名也用一個「葉」字，筆名小鳳，是何等的香艷，恰與他那魁梧奇偉的身材作反比例。周莊，屬吳江縣，是他的故鄉。各有各的地位  賢賢　　｜井水不犯河水｜　　說起了戲劇，我的腦筋裏，忽然映上了一個很複雜的影像。一板三眼的京戲，果然受人觀迎，空口說白話的文明戲，也未始不爲大衆所擁護。郎呀，卿呀的廣東戲，天天賣滿座，小妹長，小妹短的維揚戲塲裏，何尙不天天擠得水洩不通。阿哥阿哥的四明文戲，看客往往是笑口常開，唔呀唔呀的紹興的篤戲塲裏，一樣的彩聲不絕。一個人有一個的的嗜好，絕對不能强人去看不喜歡看的戲，也絕對不會把不喜歡看某種戲的顧客，吸收到某塲子裏來。這是一條無可反對的定律。　　社會上的一切事情，都是如此。再說一個例。譬如宗敎。天主敎，耶穌敎，回敎，佛敎，各敎有各敎的信徒，各敎有各敎舉行宗敎儀式的所在，各敎有各敎的精神。强迫回敎徒去受耶敎的洗禮，確是絕對不可能的事，同時，佛敎也决無吸收天主敎徒的可能。　　就以我們報界而論，各報有各報的精神，各報有各報的特長，各報有各報的讀者。要勉强本報的讀者改讀别種報紙，果然不可能，别種報紙想把本報的讀者吸收過去，同樣的是做不到的一回事，再縮小一些說，即以本報的各種附刋而論，各有各的地位。正如一個都市裏，有各種宗敎的禮拜堂。本刋當然也有本刋的信徒。　　「各有各的地位，井水不犯河水。」這是在下新發現的一個定律，可以應用到任何一個社會上。我自信這一個定律的發現，其功不在牛頓發現地心力之下。替兒女打算  達紓庵　　｜現時的刻苦圖將來的幸福｜　　我有兩個小天使般的小東人，一個女的七歲，一個男的五歲，如牛馬奴隸一樣的我，覺得這兩個小怪物的瓶憶秋攝贈小心靈上，充滿了天眞，愉快，聰敏，伶俐，尤其是白晳的皮膚，漆黑的頭髮，澄澈的眼球，粉紅的面頰，如乍開的鮮花，夜光的明珠，眞的，實在可愛得很。但是這也許是我的私心太重，（癩痢頭兒子，自誇自）不過至少有一大半是對的。我是中年的人了，又生在這不幸的環境中，自然是哀多樂少，眞所謂「一事無成兩髮斑」了！而且在這個年頭裏，張開眼來，四面瞧瞧，那椿椿件件，更加剌激得我的神經，極度的悲憤，痛楚辛酸，煩惱。可是我並不是有權威者，雖然極度的悲，怒，哀，悶，也不敢響一響，怕招惹不測，只有將這些無名的寃氣，一古腦兒，塞在「五中欲裂」的胸腔裏去。因此，有的時候，我覺得沉悶得要死的時候，這兩個小東西，小妖怪，來到我的面前，響朗的呌了一聲；「爺，做戲撥儂看，勿要弗開心。」說聲未了，拉開小嘴，唱著有腔無調的曲子，小臉上還來上幾個不規則的表情，一吹一唱，一搭一擋，像煞有介事地搬演。有時候，這兩個小精靈，扮上了相生的玩意兒，來引逗留，打倒我沉寂的愁惱，眞的，這兩個小怪物，是我消愁的小寳貝，破涕的小動物，太可愛了，不過這兩個小天使，接到了像我一日不做一日不活的人的家裏來，來日茫茫，希望在那裏？不又太可憐了嗎？因此，不得不在我百元以内的薪水裏，緊縮又緊縮，每月扣去五元，儲蓄到銀行裏去，備作小東人來日的敎育費，兩袖清風而又有子女的先生們，與我有同情，不關痛癢的答話  綿綿　　｜姑妄聽之｜　　問「大跑馬快到了。有什麽法子可以知道頭彩的號碼？」（答）「等到發表便知道啦。」　　（問）「熱天的臭蟲實在討厭！有什麽法子可以把屋内的臭蟲完全消滅？」（答）「把房子燒掉好啦！」　　（問）「瓶塞落在瓶内去了。有什麽法子可以將牠拿出來？」（答）『把瓶打碎好啦！』　　（問）『這條繩子打了一個死結。有什麽法子可以解開它』？（答）「把繩子剪斷好啦！」　　（問）「我的病已深入膏肓了。有什麽法子可以去病？」（答）「死了病也沒有啦」！　（問）一沒有兒子，只怕夫妻的愛情難於保障。醫生說我不會生育的，有什麽法子可以得到兒子呢？』（答）「呌你丈夫討個會生兒子的小老婆好啦！」　　（問）「我天天接到綁匪的恐嚇信，實不堪其憂。有什麽法子可以使他們不再來纏擾我呢？」（答）「把你全部的財産統統送給他們好啦」　　（問）「日本侵略我們的野心，愈弄愈大。有什麽法子可以救國呢？」（答）「不抵抗好啦，鎭靜好啦」小說疚心  ·了·红·瘦鵑　　那時候，他把他們夫婦二人的面龐，注視了幾秒鐘，頓覺自己有生以來，除了小時候所見的生身父母以外，從沒有見過比他們更温藹些的面目。尤其在此刻，比往日相見，加幾倍的可親。他覺得接近爐中的火，足以消除身上的冷氣，而接近他們的臉色，直能消除心底的嚴寒，直使自己枯窘的心房，片瞬中，就萌了無限生意。他這樣胡思亂想，再想到自己的後母，那種酷厲的容色，常常帶着似譏似剌如嘲如諷的意味。剛一幻現在眼前，就使他的血液裏生了芒剌。他一壁亂想，一壁重又望望東方生夫婦倆，他又幾乎不信，在同一的世界上，竟有這兩種絕對不同的面色。　　於是他不期而然的長嘆一聲，好似負千斤行百里的人，暫時得了歇息，身心兩方，都覺輕暢無比，以爲暫時可以逃出那種可畏的視線以外了。　　東方生夫婦倆，對他的家庭狀况，本是很熟悉的。他們明明知道，這一夜的事情，又是黑暗家庭勢力下醖釀成的一幕悲劇。然而他們好像預先立了契約，對於這些事情，絕對不提半個字。他們見他一會兒深思，一會兒長嘆，知道他的精神上，猶留着創痛，於是開始用幽默的口吻，你一言；我一語，盡力把他引逗，眞像大人哄騙哭鬧的小孩一樣，務要驅除他的不快。　　東方生平日，本是端莊沉毅的少年，素來不善說笑，此刻却着意做出詼笑之狀，頑皮地向他說：『你的筋骨，近來倒鍊得很好，很可以和北冰洋的白熊，拜個弟兄。這麽冷的天，倒有興致，出來找西北喝，：：：不過：你你：然而：：：』　　同樣像鬚生改造的丑角，畢竟不善詼諧。東方生剛說得這幾句，頓覺自己的話，非但並不滑稽，反而有引起他悲愴的可能。於是立刻縮住，另想換些新鮮有趣的笑話說說，然而畢竟搜尋不出，於是期期艾艾，變成滿口的『然而』與『不過』。（六）婦女的樂園根本的美容解决  鵑雲　　管花園的對我們說：「要是栽培美麗的花，必先要將花根保護好。」這是人人都知道的。　　自然是花有那樣美麗的顔色，不單是修飾葉子和花瓣，必須經過在根上的保護，和灌溉，漸漸纔生了這可愛的花　　我們人的美容，亦是如此。要是我們的氣色皮膚不好看，任憑是擦粉點臙脂，都不見有什麽功效，這究竟是爲了什麽呢？試問自己可曾追尋過根源沒有？在十個女人裏有九個，凡是臉上不大好看時，便擦小一些粉，更普通些擦一點雪花膏，佷少有人肯去研究美容問題的根本解决。　　普通妨碍我們美容的毛病，就是大便閉結。大便不通，於人生妨碍極大。有時候便面黃肌瘦，或者是皮膚毫無血色，或者精神疲乏，以及生許多雀班疹剌，有時便兩眼無神，更或者皮膚間缺少了生命素，再不然，就生出許多無益的脂肪。　　　除此以外，也有人是不覺着有什麽痛苦的，祇是臉上颜色不好看罷了。也有人吃許多藥去調理，甚至於常吃瀉藥，這都與美容無益，而且還能損去美容。　　現在祇有一個法子，便是改去一切懶惰的習慣，再照下文的四種身子的操練操練着。要是你能試過之後，一定能得到很圓滿的結果。　　　一·身子站着兩腿分開，兩手叉了腰，將身子向前彎如鞠躬式，然後將身子慢慢地向左右繞轉成圓形，計左右各六次。　　二·身子站直了，兩腿先併着，叉了腰，然後右腿曲着膝抬起來，能够抬多高就是多高，然後身子略向前傾，慢慢將腿放着地，先右腿後左腿，各練習二十次。　　三·身子站直了，兩腿分開，兩手叉腰，挺直了腿，然後腰部向左右彎到不可彎的地方爲止，練習約十二次。　　四·末了一種練習，最最緊要將門窗全打開了，好流通着新鮮空氣。你自己躺在一張平榻上，再不然便是乾凈的地板上，背貼着地板，兩手按緊了肚子，深深的呼吸，慢慢地吐出來　　照這樣每天練習，不可間斷。若是有時也患了大便不通的病，祇須喝些濃茶，或是性質温良的藥油，便可以見效的。所以要保持美容是不可以大瀉的。　　不必猶豫狐疑，天天照我所說的法子去練習着，你那副容顔，便不難和花朶一般的嬌艷。社會瑣屑  啟沃　　甲：你現在學的是那一系課？　　乙：我學政治·　　甲：哈，好極啦！升官發財，前途無量！　　乙：這可不一定！本來在政治上全靡着「混」，學問全是假的；但我將來也許混得不好。你呢？你學的什麽？　　甲：我學的是法律·　　乙：那可比我强得多！一筆案件的收入就很可觀·　　甲：但是這也全靠「混」，找錢路·　　乙：對呀！咱們是同志！</p>

<p>自由談十年後（三）  莫及　　「姑娘呀，奴隸底本向是不値錢的呵！被社會，人世摧毁，磨折，剝消，更是當然的事呵！我承認。我是奴慧｜｜做了工，沒有錢拿，我是奴隸；被人侮辱，我是奴隸；以我們底剩餘價値去養支配者壓迫者，我是奴隸！奴隸，奴隸，二麽地方都做奴隸！到什麽時候纔不做奴隸呢？要怎樣纔丢得開擱在我肩背上的石頭呢？這問題我已曾思索了許久許久了，終於答不出來。我這人，平時不是以奮發，振作，倔强自負嗎？可是社會，環境，那一處容許你底意志和力量有自由伸展的機會？譬方像你，姑娘，你便是一個不澈底的人兒。你對於站在你面前的一個奴隸，沒有同情，帮助他到終結，你就棄了他了。你知道的，你曾用了少女底善良的，温柔的，忠情的熱力，拖動了一個奴隸向前去發展，可是你在半途｜｜現在，你抛掉了！你說不是自己底主意，所以你痛苦，你悲傷；可是對於一個飄流首而被社會人世摧毁磨折剩的枯瘦的軀幹有甚麽用呢？　　「我底靑春已被奴隸生活消毁無餘了，如今只希望你能享樂你寳貴的靑春！我祝福你，姑娘！」　　這些話完全是理知的。十年來的積悶，今天向十年前愛過我的人兒說了。緊要的是希望她能重新給我新的力量，準備今後向别的道途去行進！迎兒已長得這麽可愛了，處女的嬌羞，已換上了少婦的撫媚！這床上的一對輭柔的枕兒，發光的裘褥，使人知道她已被「分身」及「金錢」攫取了！我痴情地盯住她底臉，她也痴情地相住我底臉；我們相互默然，好欠。忽然，她雙手攀住我底肩膀，搖撼了幾下，道；　　「不要這樣！你底眼光我怕！像，像一隻受了創傷的狼你看。你看白烏珠上網着紅筋！對你說，恩！我底一生，就要在這牢籠中完了，永遠被囚着，永遠被囚着了！」　　「絲毫沒有挽救的餘地嗎？」　　「沒有，絲毫沒有挽救的餘地了！但你仍舊應該去努力，把你肩膀上的石頭丢了，把站在石頭上的人們一起壓死了，卽使我在内，我也甘願的。你可不必顧到我了，我們底過去，就讓它變做回憶的資料吧！我對得住你；請永遠不要忘了，我底處女的聖潔的心，最初搖撼的人就是你！你是會幸福的，如果你不是爲了自己一人。我希望你，希望你聯絡一切的奴隸｜｜｜｜們抬起頭來，向支配者剝削者進攻，我等待着，願做你底俘虜！倘使我被石塊壓死了，你也可不必哀傷，因爲在將來，有比我更温柔，美麗的女人會來愛你；比我有思想有主張的女人會來愛你！：：：：現在給你｜｜｜「文化城」有感  祝秀俠　　我「中華」畢竟是文物之邦，文風鼎盛，於是「幽雅」「雍容」之風，也就上孚下效。什麽「無爲而治」「彈琴面治」「臥治」甚至「半部論語而治之類，那都是自古已然的事。而現在，用一句老調，就是「國家多難」之秋，一般古稱「士大夫」而現稱「要人」「名流」者，便也忙着發表拯時高見。提倡佛法救國者有之，提倡太極拳救國者有之，提倡娛樂救國者有之，他如「長期抵抗」「不抵抗」「請列强予以道德上的帮助」等等，都不失爲一種「綸巾羽扇」的「雍容」「幽雅」態度。而更使人心折者，則不久以前，有些「博士」「學者」之流，提出以北平爲「文化城」的主張！這主張不僅是十二分的聰明，尤其充分地顯示了維持文化，超然世外的學者「幽雅」本色！　　有許多人堅决主張「中國不會亡論」·起初·我很懷疑，但隨即明白，這一定是我國「博士」「學者」之流不少，一脈斯文，必不喪盡，所以儘管「野蠻」的帝國主義者野蠻，儘管第二次世界大戰爆發，但我還是可以主張「讀書救國」「少理閑事」，因爲不這樣，便將使文化古國丢臉，比亡國還不如。　　「讀書救國」與提倡「北平爲文化城」，在本質上自然是分不開的兩件事。這就是說，這些主張的根源，都是由「幽雅」「雍容」而來的·但是我以爲，稱北平爲「文化城」，還不十分澈底，根本中國就是「文化國」，不如在中國的四境竪起文化國的大牌樓，那末，「姜太公在此，百無禁忌」，看文化的面子，列强自會顧慮到「文化」前途，而對中國客氣一些。　　最近山海關再陷，「武化」的日軍，似乎很有進窺華北之勢，我想博士學者之流，遲早一定會在北平城頭上高樹起「幽雅」的大　寫着「文化城在此」，這樣，日軍的槍砲，也許只敢向天放發。　　「文化城頭退武人」遙祝我們的古都藉「文化」而清吉太平。南京路之夜  庶幾　　十字街頭的中心，印度阿三站在如像古時王侯第宅門前的旗桿斗似的東東裏，雄糾糾地。電鈴響了，紅燈，綠燈，空氣醉醺醺地罩着在馬路上發瘋似地的汽車，電車，黃包車，行人，：：：。　　這裏，沒有安靜，調和，只充滿了喧囂，恐怖，混亂。　　汽車停下在路口，一輛，又一輛，：：：红光射進車廂，年輕的少婦，艷麗，妖媚，闊綽，十足地摩登化。緊黏在大肚皮，新西裝的懷裏，妖媚的眼，醉人的笑。　　｜｜黃包車｜｜是女人的聲音。　　｜｜天韵樓！　　｜、先施公司！　　　遊藝塲裏的電梯一次一次地都裝滿了各階級的，各色各樣的遊人，不息地一上一下。　　那裏有莫名其妙的國劇，俏皮的文明戲，淫艷的蘇灘，小調，：：：　　一個媚眼，兩個媚眼，三個媚眼，於是釘梢。　　鴇母來了，　　｜｜先生，阿要去白相相？｜｜　　點綴着彩色小電燈的包車，在平滑的柏油路上奔馳，一個在前面拉，一個在後面推，大有「馬前張保，馬後王橫」的岳飛的威風。　　××旅館，××樓，××菜館：：：。　　長三？么二？色情狂的心。　　在此地，一切似乎都需要聰明，自然，乞丐也不能例外。報紙捲成了小斗，死跟着一個行人。聲音永永是低低地，單調地。别地的乞丐的口裏沒有一個不是「升官」「發財」的諂媚，然而這裏却有點兩樣，他們並不希望引起你們的憐憫，只希望引起你們的厭惡。他們知道；假使你要避免這些厭惡，必須要有一點犧牲。因此，一對對地挽着手臂慢步密語的靑年戀人？便是他們無上的主顧。　　充滿了忙碌，充滿了閑散，充滿了快樂，充滿了悲哀，辛酸的眼淚，映射着含笑的面龐，怱忙地來，怱忙地去。　　夜深了，車馬，行人逐漸地稀少了。小鰲三屈着背，叉着手靠在水門汀的牆璧上假寐。黃包車團團地圍住游藝塲的門口。　　游藝塲閉門了，又是一陣喧囂，終於是靜了，靜了。　　一部ＷatenＣan馳過，一天積下的汗，血，眼淚，毫無抵抗地隨着汚水，經過了陰溝，向黃浦江流去，遠遠地，渺茫！清晨  李梨　　清晨，我站在蒼茫的曠野裏，東方雖是逐漸在變色，但是太陽還沒有出來。　　沒有一個人，也沒有一隻狗，什麽也是沒有，望過去，只是蒼茫的一片。　　雄鷄的啼聲，逐漸起於四野，嘰嘰喳喳，小鳥醒來後也在呌，這是對光明的喜悅。　　這時候，半夜的犬吠聲，已是沒有了，汪，汪，汪，那討厭的聲音。天上是怎麽樣的呢？星兒是很少很少的了，祗有比較大的，殘留着，發着閃閃的光；所謂靑的天，這時候，來得特别的漂亮，格外的蔚藍而澄清，　　慢慢地，東方的顔色，由嫰靑，而淺白，而淡紅，這是太陽快要出來的先兆！　　這淡紅色，浮漾開去，於是差不多大地也快變色，欣喜充滿了各種的物的心，　　一變，再變，：：：太陽透出頭來了，紅的光，充滿了整個的曠野，被覆了整個的世界。　　這不呌做清晨，而是呌做朝晨了。磨命  曼　　執首自己的生命，看準了一塊頑石，我安排好了屠塲，要將自己生生地磨死。　　×××　　繁華世界是爲你而安排，你却不知享受反破壞；生何曾絲毫辜負了你？你這生的叛逆鬼！　　×××　　重些輕些我着意地磨，把在我的手裏，你住那裏躱？石上發出輕微的細響，娑娑，我拉長自己的耳朶細領略。　　×××　　生命執在手裏漸漸地薄，血肉磨在石上漸漸地多，看你還能掙扎到幾時？我冷冷地嘲問着自己的半死屍。　　×××　　宇宙撞響了喪鐘，生命已磨死，放開魔掌，嘘一口輕微的氣；但遠遠地遠遠地一聲雄鷄啼，鮮明的血水照破了黑天地。長篇創作時代與愛的歧路（續稿）  張資平　　「怎麽又還讓他們儘住在這家裏？」　　他反問了這句話後，又不禁自慚起來。　　「他就要回去了，明天不走，後天也要走了。：：：我早就呌他們走，不過事情還沒有了。他們眞害人不淺！：：：」　　「害了你什麽？」　　海泉登時發生了一種幸災樂禍的感情。　　「害了我給林先生誤解了。眞對不住你了，林先生，累了你許多天數精神上不快樂」！　　「于我有什麽關係。不過給曾先生曉得了時，：：：」　　他故裝鎭靜地說，並且對他諷剌了一下。　　「啊啦！林先生，你懷疑人不要懷疑得太深刻了呀！」　　她此刻改變了她剛才的戰戰兢兢的態度，說了後，很有趣般地笑起來了。　　　　「：：：：：：：：：：：」　　他又有些怪她，何以竟這樣地笑得有來。他忙把剛才輕鬆下去的態度又重新振作起來。　　「眞的不要再這樣地恨惱我了。看見林先生生氣，你眞不知道我心裏是如何的難過啊！」她又哀懇着般地說。　　「：：：：：：：」　　他沒有回答，只走到書桌前去收拾書包。　　「今天眞的不能請假一天？」　　鶴子夫人歪着頭，笑嘻嘻地儘望着他說。他此刻才注意到她足下沒有穿襪子，外面雖然加上了一件毛皮的旗袍，但是一雙雪白的下腿仍然在旗袍脚下露了出來。他的意志怱然有點動搖起來了。他想不上課也未嘗不可，明天借同學的筆記抄抄就無問題的。從來很少缺席過，就三兩天不上課，于功課是沒有什麽影響的。他眞想答應她休息一天，陪她出去逛公園看電影了。因爲他也是渴望了她幾天了，好像離别了幾個月這末久。　　但是劉佩珠的清麗的臉龐和理智的表情忽然幻現到他的眼前來了。同時，他憶及她的信裏所說的話了。　　「：：：你對於我未免太多心了。你那些話都是不必要的，極廉價的感傷性。希望你以後振作一下你的這種靑春期的病態吧。我們的友情是極眞摯的，决不能因爲彼此離開了便會有所變更，不問友情或戀愛，如果一定要兩個人畢生相守着才能保全，那末這一定不是眞摯的友情或戀愛了，我敢斷言。海泉，我們唯有向我們的前途努力，增進我們的學業，增高我們的地位。那末，我們的愛情也可以日見日的堅固。：：：你不是也說過了麽？我倆的交情是從交藝｜｜｜｜卽是從學問出發的，再加上彼此的人格的保證，一定有更進一步的發展。：：：好在我不久就可以和你相見，因爲我决定了跟我的哥哥和嫂嫂于明春到上海來就學。」：：：：　　「不能請假」。　　他忙簡單地回答鶴子夫人。　　「你還是不能原諒我麽」？　　她悄然地說。</p>

<h3>對於「惰性民族」應有的理解</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>『：：中華民族，實爲一惰性民族，對付此種惰性民族，日人所採之手段，至爲正當。或以此種手段移而加諸西方任何民族之上，恐無一日之安矣：：』上面這段话是本月十一日申報北平通信「東北血淚談」中所述某西報爲日人張目之評論中的一節。我們看了這種譏笑的言論，一定是要憤怒而認爲可羞辱的一件事，但若回想中國人，受人侮辱的事，此不過爲最近我們所聽到的一個最顯著的例子罷了，所以，如要雪此羞辱，决非一時的憤怒所能解决。我們必須要對此侮辱的批評，加以探討，看看人所稱之於吾人者，倒底有幾分事實是對的。我們不怕有缺點，惟怕不能理解這缺點的所以然與力謀所以補救的辦法，這是在此整個民族存亡關頭，所應有的覺悟與决心。</p>
<p>何謂「惰性的民族」？「惰」這個字可以說包含着「不振作，不求進取，忍辱偷生，沒有奮鬭的精神」等一類的意義。我們民族過去所表現的，是不是「如此，如此」的一類情形，我們不妨平心靜氣的來反省一下：自從九一八事變後與上海戰事失敗以來，所謂國難期中，我們看到全國黨政軍的紛擾如故，民衆的麻木情形如故，老實說，有多少我們自己的國人，就深覺此民族精神的「不振作」與頽廢的程度，實達極點，對於復興民族的這個問題，尤感覺是一件無從着手與十二分困難的事。還有一班國人以爲我們的民族精神，是寓於家族主義之中，現在家族制度的精神，旣日形渙散，於是此固有的民族精神遂亦失所依附而完全消失。補救的方法，在創造一種新的民族精神，建立一個新的民族國家。還有那些優生學者，他們則更以爲中國有一大部分地方的人種，是古老衰弱了，因此這整個民族，亦趨於古老衰弱的途徑，挽救之道，他們是主張根本從改良人種入手。</p>
<p>以上所舉的三種民族性的批評，各有他的理論立塲與事實的根據，是未可完全抹煞與否認的。所謂「惰性的民族」充其極也不過是如此。而我們所要注意的，乃是對於這種批評的應有理解與認識，現在可分兩點來討論：</p>
<p>第一點，我們從國難以來，民族精神的表現上來說，對於以上各種批評，都表示相當的同意，我們祇要具有振作的决心，對於本身的缺點，本是歡迎批評的不遑，又何必怕人指責。我們所應竭力反省的，就是一方面無改革振作的决心和勇氣，而一方面則又力求避免反對的批評，這種風氣，在國内政治社會裏面，勢力頗大，這是我們所要大聲疾呼，力謀矯正的。更進一步說，我們自己對自己民族的缺點應先理解其來源，並站定我們復興民族的主張與信心，然後對於他種批評，方有判斷是非或批評一部分錯誤的根據。因爲出於憤激，理論，諷剌性的批評，每容易入於浮淺，迂遠，尖刻的一途，我們若本身先未理解，則自談不到主張與振作的决心，遂容易爲浮淺的意見而灰心，迂遠的理論而喪氣，尖刻的批評而奮怒!結果則仍是一無成就。</p>
<p>第二點，關於以上三種對於民族缺點的批評，我們一貫的理解與認識是這樣：所謂民族精神的頽廢，已達極點的一層，本來是無可諱言的事實。但要說是到今日爲最，則爲似是而非之談了，我們若一研究過去種種喪權辱國的歷史與各時期民族精神的表現，就可知達於極點的民族頽廢精神，實已過去而不在今日了。現在却已是覺悟了的頽廢民族，正在這裏與帝國主義者掙扎反抗呢。若說中國民族精神，是已隨家族制度而渙散，殊不知中國人對國家觀念的淺薄，即由於家族制度所造成，在事實上，現在國人的愛國心，反因家族制度的崩潰而增加。根據這種理由，我們也可用同樣的話來答復這以爲今日民族精神的不振作，是由於人種衰老的先生們的意見。我們知道，一種民族精神的養成，完全是國家制度及歷史環境的産物，屬於社會的遺傳多，屬於生理的遺傳少，現在沒有一個人能證明每個中國人的智慧，平均起來是不如日本人，俄國人，意大利人及英美不德等國的人，但是中國民族的組織性，則顯然的與各列强有不同的地方，這是過去文化，制度遺傳下的結果，不能與生理的遺傳混爲一談的。至於「惰性民族」的批評，我們以上的解釋已回答了這個諷剌的譏笑。若更進一步說，我們對於我們民族「惰性」的造成，是有了我們的認識，我們相信我們民族是在復興的途中，但却决不敢走一班所謂「不惰性」民族｜在個人資本主義制度下｜所走的過去種種「不惰性」的慘殺，以及未來還要慘殺的那條路！這又是我們於聽到這「惰性民族」的批評以後，所得到的一點深刻印象。</p>
<p>總之，人家批評我們爲「惰性的民族」要亦不是無由而來，我們祇要將我們各個人所有的刻苦耐勞的精神，團結組織起來，就可以成爲一個「不惰性的民族」。我們現在是立在這全世界新舊制度大轉變的激盪下奮鬭，這是民族存亡的關頭，我們要有决心，更要有信心做這復興民族的工作，我們應以有組織有步驟的方法，結合志同道合者，大聲疾呼，先促起全國上下凡有血性者的覺悟，然後再普及全體民衆，在復興民族，培養民族精神的目標下，各盡心力，埋頭苦幹，分工合作，痛下功夫，則此茫茫的神州，或可免於陸沉的危險！</p>

<h3>店員怠慢顧客的心理</h3>
<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>（店員慢客問題）</p>
<p>閱前幾期本刋見載有兩篇討論店員怠慢顧客問題的文字，一篇是游萍君「店員爲什麽要怠慢顧客？」一篇是荆祥𣇓君的「我底店員怠慢顧客觀」。這兩篇文章，對於店員所以怠慢顧客的觀點，據我個人私見所及，覺得前者固然不是中肯之談，而後者也非透澈之論。大概二君所述的理由，僅能算作幾分之幾的怠慢顧客的成分罷了！</p>
<p>上海的社會，純屬勢利二字所構成，就是所謂「祇奉衣衫不奉人」的勢利社會！一般智識淺薄的店員，經不起耳濡目染，逐日薰陶，遂不期然而然地養成了一種勢利的觀念，而對待顧客，因以分成軒輊。他們的唯一心理，是在崇富輕貧，無論對於男女都是如此（不過靑年而又摩登的女子，當然較爲重視）。所最歡迎而視爲値得殷勤招待的，厥惟衣服麗都，舉止闊綽的顧客。反之，如見衣服樸素，舉止寒酸的，就現出滿不高興的神氣，甚至遽以白眼相加。所以他們對待汽車階級和摩登人物，與對待（尙有重要文字轉入第二版）</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>平民階級和村夫鄉婦，大都因人而施，各具一副面孔，這並不是我信口誣衊，實因有所見而云然。</p>
<p>新近我爲了過年，來滬辦點應需物件，在福州路的一家洋貨舖中，買些小孩玩具。同時進來了一位土氣滿身的鄉下人，幾個店員都像沒有瞧見，不去理他，待他開口動問時，才有一位夥計很勉强的欠身招呼。他買的是幾尺本廠布，在夥計用尺量好，將要動剪的當兒，他很委婉地請求加放一點，那個夥計就把剪子一擲，板起面孔道：『我們店中是足尺加三，已經放足，還要嚕囌甚麽？』他碰了這個釘子，就此不了敢開口，一任其胡亂擺佈，等他走出店門，夥計還駡了一聲「屈死！」這時又來了一位紳士式的先生，後面還跟着眷屬，恰巧仍由那個夥計過去招待。可是他的態度已不似先前那樣傲慢，頓時換出一種和藹的神情，把櫃中貨品，指點周詳，言之諄諄，不憚煩瑣。如此敷衍了半天，那位女人覺得不好意思了才由她提議買了丈半的白竹布。在動剪之時，她呌他多放幾寸，他很爽快地連說『可以可以』，將手一鬆，放出倒有尺許，嘴裏還說『尺把東西，能値幾文？』隨即給他們包紮停當。臨走時還傴腰曲背，恭送如儀。試思同是這個夥計，何以對待顧客前后如出兩人？似此不同的態度，寗非是勢利觀念的充分表示嗎？然而這種現象，並不是普徧的，未曾沾染這惡習的店員，畢竟尙有其人。因爲我的衣服原不漂亮，而同我交易的那位夥計，倒是很有禮貌咧！</p>
<p>欲袪除此種惡劣觀念，那末，誠如荆祥鼎君說的『所謂敎育的陶冶力了』！</p>
<p>一般資産階級的店主們，怎不起而熟籌業餘敎育呢？</p>
<p>工商界生活</p>
<h3>一個矛盾十足的多層生活者　木人</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>（多層生活）</p>
<p>如果我是個僱員嗎？那末，我亦是個僱主；如果我是個學生嗎？那末我亦是個敎師，所以，在同一時期之内，我是過着受指揮的僱員生活，指揮人的僱主生活；受敎訓的學生生活，和敎訓人的敎師生活，在這種種根本矛盾的環境之下，在不知眞相的人聽了，或不免要說我是吹牛：然而，事實畢竟是事實，於是便引起了我寫這篇文字的動機。</p>
<p>坦白地說吧，我是某公司的一個會計員，一天到晚，只做着算盤和賬簿們的伴侶，但是，往來於摩登的辦公室之間，出沒於威嚴的買辦者之前，那似乎又是我不能免的副職了。所以，在辦公室裏應當有怎樣的規矩，在買辦先生前，應當有怎樣的禮貌，我都細心而卑鄙地學習着　因爲一般經騐豐富的同事吿訴我　這是被僱者的「飯碗經」。</p>
<p>但是，一到家裏，我便甚麽『飯碗經』都不滿了；因爲，在那時，我已一躍而爲聲勢赫赫的僱主了。處身在一間古氣重松的舖子裏，無論何時，誰都會畏懼我，不，誰都會服從我，祇要我把嘴唇兒一動時，他們便都會拿出最恭敬的禮貌來答復我，簡而言之，和我在公司裏辦事時對付買辦先生的那種態度一樣。這是爲甚麽？這是因爲他們亦懂得「飯碗經」，不是麽？</p>
<p>不過，站在被僱者的地位時，我常會感到，不，或許還是留戀着讀書的興趣。被僱的日了愈久，我所抱的興趣亦愈高。於是爲了受這一種智識慾的重重驅使，我便很勇敢地走進某夜校再度學生生活了，在那裏我熱烈地和朋友們切磋學問，安靜地受敎授們的薰陶閒來和男同學說說笑話，和女同學做做鬼臉，有笑有駡，其樂融融，每以爲往年的黃金時代，不啻又活現在目前了。</p>
<p>讀書畢竟是幸福的，但是，敎書是更幸福吧？這是不時在我腦筋中盤旋着的一個問題，當理想打勝了猜疑的時候，我就拉夫似地拉了幾位「有眼　子」，竟忙裏偷閒，自得其樂地做起義務敎師來了，不過，結果是這樣，字典是弄　了不少，鉛粉是嘗到了滋味·所謂幸福中的更幸福，大概是這些吧？</p>
<p>爲環境所支配的人都是這樣地過着他矛盾十足的多層生活的。</p>

<h3>糖果大王　王滄萍</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>前天，我終算吃福無邊，借着那邵老朋友（亦羣）的光，在冠生園大嚼一頓，而且還把我介紹給糖果大王洗冠生，彼此暢叙了兩個鐘頭。承洗先生的情，很周到的領導我們到各部份去參觀。他說：　們所需要的原料，共約一千多種，而所出的糖果，也有數百種之多。依中國人的口味，在實際的需要上，雖然用不到這許多種，但是我國的各種事業，件件都落在外人之後，單就糖果一業，他們的花色，種類，即多至幾百種，我旣然做了這一行糖果事業，我就應當負起我的使命，盡着我的能力去和他們奮鬥，就是不能和他們並駕齊驅，要亦不致於望塵莫及哩！聽了這幾句話，實使我們不能不贊嘆洗先生眼光的遠大。</p>
<p>每天天還沒有亮，他便從熱烘烘的被窩裏鑽出頭來，冒着風寒，進廠裏去指揮一切。雖是極小的屑事，也必要經過他的考慮，所以偌大的一爿工廠，内部的事，不論大小鉅細，他沒有不了然於胸中的。</p>
<p>他對於廠裏的職工，都能用盡其才，優劣各得其所，所以無論在秩序上或工作的效率上，在在能得到良好的成績。他還爲他們辦了一所糖菓業的子弟學校，除聘請專家負責敎導外，洗先生還每天抽出餘暇，擔任着敎授的工作，以培植糖果業的人材。其畢業出來的子弟，留廠或不留廠，均聽憑各人的自願，一些些沒有苛刻的條件。他旣然能這樣的待人，留廠的子弟，當然能各盡其力的服務，就是不留廠的子弟，他們旣已成了糖果業的專門人材，間接就多了一個和外國糖果業奮鬥的人材。這樣說來，中國糖果業的前途，正是不可限量，而這一點却又不能不歸功於洗先生的。</p>

<h3>滿師</h3>
<p>— 李培林</p>
<p>「金生，把熨斗去加些炭。」裁縫店老板狠狠的吩咐他的拖着鼻涕的徒弟。金生應接了熨斗走出去，剛生好火進來，驀地給師父的叱聲嚇得一呆；「什麽，昨晚我壓在作板底下的那個香烟頭那裏去了，莫不是又是你這小鬼偷去吸了的？」</p>
<p>「師父，我：我：沒有曉得。」金生拿熨斗的那隻手有些發抖。</p>
<p>「不曉得？香烟頭自己會飛了嗎？你做了賊還不快快的說出來！」</p>
<p>「我：我眞的沒：沒：」</p>
<p>「什麽事？大清早就嘩啦嘩啦的，金生，火油乾了，到隔壁烟紙店去打五個銅板來。」</p>
<p>一個女人的尖銳的聲音，那是站在半梯中的篷頭的師母娘。金生小心地把熨斗放下，走到扶梯邊，接了火油壼和銅板。要想走，師母第二次的囑咐他；「慢！大師弟要上學了，你陪他去，還有這裏十個銅板，再買一條油炸檜，二塊豆腐干，其餘的買黃豆芽。」</p>
<p>大師弟丨老闆的兒子不肯上學，他哭喪着臉，拉了母親的褲子不肯放，金生好容易把他從半梯上拖了下來，還吃了幾下小拳頭的賜與，當他領着大師弟走出門口的時候，他回頭不放心地問了一聲，「師母，五個銅板火油一條油炸檜二塊豆腐干三個銅板黃豆芽嗎？」</p>
<p>吃過了中飯，王榮記蘇廣成衣舖的老闆王阿榮，一付老花眼鏡帶在鼻尖上，眼角上掛着打呵欠乘留下來的眼淚，有一針沒一針地在縫着一件羊皮褂子，右手不時把揑着的針尖往頭皮上擦擦。老闆娘默默地抱着未滿週歲的女兒，心裏在計劃今天打花會打些什麽名目。金生很吃力在洗師妹的尿布，他的動作顯得很呆滯，屋子裏暫時很沈默。</p>
<p>「年關倒又迫近了，」老闆對正在出神地追索昨夜夢景的妻子說，「怎麽生意還是這樣清？張公館裏這節衣裳也添得不多。</p>
<p>「你自己不巴結做，帮手又不用個把！像隔壁的李裁縫，用了四個師父，還一天到晚的忙得來不及呢。」是老板娘的埋怨。</p>
<p>「帮手？沒有生意怎麽好用帮手？虧這小鬼學了二年多的生意。一些本事也沒有，明年要滿師了，連一條褲子都裁不來的人，呌他怎好帮我出去做生意？」</p>
<p>本事，金生對於這兩個字的意義根本就很茫然。師父從來不曾敎過他什麽本事，他只知道一天到晚的供使喚，當雜差，那裏學過什麽「本事」呢？又那裏有餘暇讓他學「本事」呢？</p>
<p>外面進來一個老媽子，這是張公館裏的娘姨，他手裏捧着一個扁平的包袱，裏面有一圈高高的硬領　出在包袱的外而，一望而知是一件女子的衣服。</p>
<p>「什麽事呀？」老闆站起來招呼，「劉媽，是不是這件旗袍的腰身做得太窄了，三房裏少奶奶呌你　來改的？我　的時候，對他說這尺寸要小　　　：」</p>
<p>「不　　　　　住他的來什。一面把包袱　開來。</p>
<p>「你看，這袖口上給你燙了一個洞，少奶奶他說不要了，要你賠，否則扣你的裁縫工錢！」</p>
<p>「什麽，香烟洞？讓我來仔細看看，嘸：眞的，這裏的一個焦洞：噢！這定是金生惹的禍。他媽的，這小鬼送旗袍，在路上偷吃香烟，却把火星掉到野鴨絨上去了，金生，來！</p>
<p>他嚇呆了，兩隻浸在脚盆洗尿布的手停止了動作，眼睛木瞪着師父的尊容。老板一把拉住他的耳朶，指着作板上的旗袍的口袖問他，「這香烟洞是不是你燙的！」</p>
<p>「不：不是：我弄的：我：沒有：」兩隻濕手亂搖着。</p>
<p>（沿有重要文字轉入第三版）</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>「不是你弄的？哼，我做生活辰光向來不吃烟的，你這還要賴！」王老闆手裏提裁尺，拍的一聲，金生的額角上起了一個靑塊，接着，拍，拍，：：「啊呀：：我：：沒：：」「你强，你强，」拍，拍，拍：：</p>
<p>劉媽看得不忍了，他和老闆娘把他們狠命</p>
<p>的拖開，她說：</p>
<p>「老闆，你一味的打又有什麽用呢？他又不是有意燙的焦洞，」</p>
<p>「劉媽，不是你拉開，我恨不得把這小鬼一古腦兒打死！」老松喘著氣。</p>
<p>「廢話少講，旣然是他不留心瞧的禍。那末你預備怎樣賠法？」</p>
<p>「這樣吧，劉媽。請你代我向少奶奶討個情，求她看我面上，饒這小賊一次。現在讓我把這焦洞的地方，拿到織補店去補一補，就請少奶奶將就的穿一穿。好在也看不大出的，你看好不好？」</p>
<p>劉媽怏怏地去了，王老板自己在佩服自己的　做工」。金生沒頭沒腦的挨了一頓打，他的麻木了的心，好像平靜的小池一樣，給風一吹，略爲波動了一下，但不久便又平靜了。</p>
<p>夜深了。樓梯底下金生的臥室裏，悶鬰的空氣傳佈着發霉的物件的氣息。屋的四週，滿堆着傢伙。僅僅的，留下這可以容金生每晚打地舖睡覺的一些空隙，被灰塵四週罩住的那隻五支光燈泡所發出來的昏黃的光線，黯淡地照在他的呆臉上，照見他正在補一隻剛才脫下來的破襪。師母從樓上跑了下來，當她發見樓梯底下電燈還亮着的時候，她似乎抓着什麽機會，一個可以發洩她的長舌婦的本事的機會；「小鬼，幾點鐘了，怎麽還不睡覺，怪不得你每天早上老是攤在床上睡不醒！哼，原來你做自己的生活做得這樣巴結，這倒不像做正經事體的那樣不高興了，哼，我家的電燈費點得太少啦，要你這小鬼頭來多化些是不是？」</p>
<p>師母蹬着樓梯勞什了一回子，上去了。電燈的總門一關，金生發見自己的周圍是漆黑了。他滿不在乎地掏出放在袋裏的那個蠟燭頭點着放地地板上，仍舊補他的襪。幾乎每天要輪着一次的像他那種日間的遭遇，不曾在他腦海裏留下什麽特殊的印象，他只是很自然地吐出：「橫堅明年要滿師了，滿了師就有工錢，苦工也有師弟來頂替，自己就好寫意了。管他媽的，吃苦也就只吃在這幾天裏。」他希望早些「滿師」，他的唯出路就是「滿師」。</p>

<h3>馬路巡閱使</h3>
<p>— 鄭行健</p>
<p>在現代社會中有兩種閒人；第一種是飯來張口，錢來伸手，早晨睡到上午十一時纔起床，午餐｜｜也可稱爲他的早餐｜｜後又了幾圈麻雀，又到××飯店去晚餐，出來到××大戲院看影戲，隨後到××舞塲跳舞，直至深夜三四時纔回家。這種呌做廢物化的閒人。</p>
<p>鄙人也是閒人之一，但非上述那類的閒人。鄙人是屬於第二種的。天天在馬路上當巡閱使，却不是忙裏偷閒，乃是躲饋。看報時第一先找徵求欄及聘請欄，想覓一相當的職業。夜裏睡在床上，　着腦力籌劃一個覓錢付租　米的方法。一日二十四小時，一小時六十分鐘，每一分鐘腦筋裏想着的都是覓錢的方法。</p>
<p>喂！閱者諸君，你們需要一個對於中芙文有高中程度，能西文打字，無嗜好，能耐勞，月薪只要二十五元左右的誠實靑年職員麽？如合意，請你寫封信給我，包你十分滿意。我的通訊處是本埠同孚路六十五號繆君轉。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>人類同情心的表現</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>讀了貴刋一月十二日答復我的話，使我非常漸愧。我所以提出這『騎馬找馬騎』的辦法，是困爲要顧全事實。吳君的雙親，爲着『自顧不暇』的緣故，想減輕負担，才飢不擇食、在滬戰以後、仍責令他的兒子在日本商店裏執業，不問可知他們是爲迫切的個人問題所壓迫，對於民族思想，國家觀念，是很薄弱的。吳君倘一旦辭職，上海旣無存身之處，回鄉去吃老米飯，怕也辦不到罷？因此，我勸他忍辱一時，以待機會的光臨，並不是忘了滬戰時，胡阿毛開汽車入黃浦江，爲國捐軀；與目下義勇軍在冰天雪地裏作殊死戰的壯烈舉動呀！</p>
<p>我是商店裏的一個小職員，夠不上稱爲『有力者，』但可巧某商店要招請一位練習生；我可以代爲介紹。</p>
<p>編者先生，請你將吳君的籍貫年齡及通信處，在報上發表，以便通函接洽；這是很希望的。</p>
<p>吳𣇓一、一三·</p>
<p>編者按：𣇓鑫君對於一位素未謀面的吳君，能設身處地，顧到事實，提出切實可行的辦法，並更進而爲實際粘的援助，充分表現一般人汩沒已久的同情心，非常欽佩！至於吳君的年齡籍貫及通信處，在沒有得到他的允許之前，未便發表。希望𣇓鑫君把自己的通信處見示，俾可遵囑一一抄奉。</p>

<h3>從舞臺跑到銀幕（下）紅薇</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>王瑩　她是安徽人，說得一口流利的國語，她加入過許多劇社，像辛酉，摩登·大道·聯合等·她是中國公學文學系的學生，也會寫文章，但她對於文學的興趣，遠不如戲劇的濃厚。她在舞臺上的表演，比胡萍艾霞好。她的入電影界，和和艾霞一樣，也是先進天一，再由天一轉到明星。她本在天一主演「女性的呐喊，」導演是沈西苓，已拍好一千多尺，因爲成績不大好，天一當局爲愼重起見，預備重行拍過，但是她和沈西苓，已等不及，急急的跑到明星去，仍舊她任主角，沈任導演，於是這「女性的呐喊，」由天一喊到明星·現在片子已將拍好，不知她這一喊，能否喊得響？</p>
<p>葉秋心　她是湖北黃崗人，今年還只十八歲，可是絕不像是髫齡的小姑娘。她的面貌，很有點像張織雲，但是一雙明媚的秋波，要比張織雲高明得多。在這幾位女話劇家之中，以容貎論，她居第一。她曾畢業於漢口聖約瑟女校，曾加入南國，明月，等劇社，并且擅長平劇，老生·鬚生·靑衣·都唱得很好。曾在蕪湖歌舞臺等戲院登臺表演。一度加入武漢影片公司，旋即脫離·現在任天一公司演員，在新片「孽海雙鴛」中飾一個女敎育家，雖然只有一二幕戲，已可以看出她在電影界有很大的希望。</p>
<p>倉隱秋　她是河南人，她的父親在北平作官，她便隨着父親在北平讀書，畢業於私立文治中學，後來又入北平大學藝術學院小劇院，專門研究戲劇。她天資聰明。性情活潑，唱歌舞蹈，都很擅長。那時北平開辦一家日月影片公司，聘她担任「她的環境」的主角，不幸該公司經濟不充足，該片還未拍成，即行停辦，但她對於電影的興趣正濃，便束裝南下，投入天一公司。不久道路協會邀請男女電影明星在新世界舉行游藝大會，她和田方王慧娟等，表演話劇「壓迫；」流利的國語，深刻的表情，很得觀衆的贊許。「孽海雙鴛」中，她飾一個王家嫂子，表演也很不差。（完）</p>
<h3>孤軍之一幕孤軍在前線消息大中公司出品</h3>
<h3>評「戰地歷險記」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在反帝的立塲上値得一看</p>
<p>這是一部以「一二八」戰事爲背景的影片。大概是爲了易於呌座起見，便不得不以大學生爲中心而穿挿成一個戀愛的故事。一羣「小姐」「少爺」的大學生，因國難而激於義奮，自動組織義勇軍，立志報國。其中有黃振漢，丁明霞男女二情侶亦愛國不敢後人，先定終身大事並回家探親而後共赴國難。正因如此分散而後各立奇功。最後旣愛國又團圓。</p>
<p>就結構上說；雖其中「巧」處頗多，（如丁明霞盜地圖出敵軍司令部大門等：：：）但也沒有多大的破綻。有幾處表現出民衆的力量，如難民羣起打死敵兵二人處，雖然不見得如何偉大，但個人主義的英雄汽車夫王阿根的覺悟，却表現得很有力量。拉夫，迷色敵司令部等塲面，都不免幼稚。</p>
<p>導演張石川在這片中雖然不見得如何成功，但是王阿根的伏線種種·確是難能可貴的。士兵們無子彈，也許是爲了省錢的原故。對於戰爭沒有有力的暴露。砲兵和戰壕都顯得戰純和非寫實。然而因爲種種　觀環境，我們也應當特别原諒。</p>
<p>一般的演員都能平平過去，然而飾匪目的却是在賣力「做」戲。王吉亭在後段特别有力。</p>
<p>而一般的都有失之沉着，小動作過多，這未免不是國片的弱點吧。</p>
<p>佈景無破綻。燈光明晰，特别是丁明霞自幕後窺探時更爲美麗。字幕沒有過好之處，特别是只能以「匪」字代替××想起來眞令我們老百姓傷心。鏡頭亦可惜不能更靈活的運用。</p>
<p>總之，這是一部還好的影片，特别是反帝的立塲上，値得一看。雖然在技巧上不見得如何成功，但是比較的說總還是好的。我希望明星公司在不久的將來，將有更能敎育民衆的好作品在我們眼前出現。特别是對於張石川先生，我們更懷着大的希望：爲擴大民族戰爭面前進！</p>
<h3>明星新進人才的統計</h3>
<p>— 般若</p>
<p>半年之中增加了兩打</p>
<p>一二八後，上海各業莫不凋敝，電影事業當然不在例外，然而明星聯華天一三大製片公司却並不因着社會的不景氣而阻碍他們進取的精神，單就明星公司一家而論，在一九三二年下半年，各項人才竟羅致到了兩打之多，這也算大可驚人的了罷，今由調查所得代替他們作一個分類的統計，報吿在下面！</p>
<p>導演丨李萍倩　沈西苓　陳鏗然</p>
<p>演員丨艾霞　孫敏　王瑩　宣景琳</p>
<p>王以吳　趙丹　徐琴芳　陳少敏</p>
<p>攝影丨嚴秉衡　高廷章</p>
<p>編劇丨于廷勛　陸小洛</p>
<p>收音丨司徒慧敏</p>
<p>劇務丨胡悅溪　朱少泉</p>
<p>卡通丨萬籟鳴　萬古蟾</p>
<p>文牘丨王乾白</p>
<p>宣傳丨李君磐</p>
<p>美術丨胡倬雲</p>
<p>廣吿丨高季琳</p>
<p>這二十四位職演員中，十位是由天一公司轉過來的，還有四位是因爲友聯停辦之後，才加入明星合作的，不過，他們在半年之中增添的人數，並不止此二十四位，其餘因爲不甚重要，所以沒有列入。</p>

<h3>「兩位有聲影機發明家」補遺</h3>
<p>— 靑霞</p>
<p>在本刋曾有明君的「兩位有聲影機發明家」一文，所述的是顧鶴鳴和竺清賢。其實，還有一位石世磐也是有聲影機發明者的一員，可是文内却不曾紀出來；因此，我把牠寫在后面，想讀者總不致以爲我此舉之「畫蛇添足」吧！</p>
<p>提起石世磐，知道他的人確乎不多；不過他在電影界裏，倒已有相當的歷史和充分的成績。</p>
<p>他對於攝影技術，有悠久時期的研</p>
<p>究，曾任某公司的攝影師；後來他感覺到攝影生活的乏味，同時他平素很喜研究科學，所以便抛棄了攝影工作而從事研究有聲影機。這是他研究有聲影機的開始。</p>
<p>他一次失敗，二次；二次失敗，三次；以至四次五次，：：：總是不斷的研究，絕不消極；灰心；：：：直至去年十月間，才吿成功。他第一次收音，是收自己的譚話；發音很是清晰，與舶來品相伯仲；最近由電檢會給予專利證；同時，還獲到了不少的褒物。</p>
<h3>「大飯店」劇本的來歷</h3>
<p>— 森</p>
<p>米曲羅公司出版的「大飯店」一片，原劇是一個德國女子，名字喚做維基朋姆ＶickiＢaum的所作。但如何介紹到美國的銀幕上去，却有一段逸聞。原來介紹這本劇本給米曲羅公司經理的，是一位内衣廠的老板和一位油漆店的經理。那老板的名字是哈萊摩西ＨarryＭases，因爲妻子的薰陶，對戲劇很有興趣，也爲了這個緣故，才從支加哥搬家到紐約城來。一天在一爿外國書舖裏，無意間期到一本Ｍensohen　in　Ｈotel，大爲賞識，就買了下來。他很想把它排成戲，放到舞臺上去，但是除了金錢之外，困難很多。他决定不下，便求助於他的朋友羅勃脫福格爾ＢobＶogel。羅勃脫是一所漆店的經理，事情很忙，把那一本書順手抛在抽屜裏，往後也忘懷了。直到有一天四月裏，天下大雨，無事可做，他才想起那本書來。讀後他也非常中意，就想介紹它到銀幕上去。他便送它到米曲羅公司裏去。於是米曲羅公司的經理歐文戴槃ＩrvjngＴhalberg過目了，下了一個採用的决定。於是，在哈萊和羅勃脫的名義之下，這戲在百老匯戲院裏排演了，贏得非常熱烈的贊美。米曲羅公司替他們安排這一切，以銀幕的攝製權爲條件。現在，哈萊已不妨多覓些戲劇，寳勃地收起了那漆店，在米曲羅公司裏做事了。</p>
<h3>「火柴大王」本事（九）</h3>
<p>— 希孟譯</p>
<p>她知道他穿的衣服，不是步行的衣服。鞋是薄底的。衣服亦很單薄。在薩慈堡的山中，每天下午，必定陰雲四合，不起雨中，天氣亦很冷，這係每天如此，所以保羅的衣服，是很少合宜的。</p>
<p>「你能夠長時間的步行麽？」她問。</p>
<p>「這是我最喜歡的。」</p>
<p>「山上路有些不大好走吧？」</p>
<p>「越不好走，我越喜歡。」</p>
<p>「好極了，我們去爬孟墟斯堡。你能去麽？」</p>
<p>「我正要這樣提議，」保羅毫不遲疑的說。「這不是一個再好沒有的開端麽？我們的嗜好，何以這樣相同呢？」</p>
<p>「我想：：：」慕爾娜微笑的說。</p>
<p>她不時的偷看他的臉以。他緊緊的追隨在她的左右，行路頗感不便，但還能顯出愉快的神氣，竭力的跟隨。到了山裏，雨下得很大，鞋上都沾了泥水，衣服亦淋濕了，緊緊地貼在他的身上。慕爾娜自己是穿的厚衣，專爲走山用的，所以身上一些也不濕。</p>
<p>「我最喜歡雨地裏走路，你怎麽樣？」慕爾娜說。</p>
<p>「天下還有比這件事更有趣的嗎？」保羅毫不在意的說。「下面的天氣，係風和日麗，而山上有這樣的大雨，眞是奇景，人生難得遇見的奇事。」</p>
<p>「這個山上，每天下午三點鐘，一定下雨的。」她吿訴他，並且看看他。她知道他早就明白這是她的惡作劇。但是他一味的微笑着，絕不在意。至終她芳心内，亦不由得生出一種佩服之意來。</p>
<p>那天晚上，慕爾娜在旅館中的房間裏，獨自一個人聽留聲機器，那張唱片係着名提琴家齊林諾彈的「愛情的樂趣。」她繼續不斷的唱了再唱，他正在聽得出神的當兒，忽然聽到一個男子的聲音：「這是個再好沒有的開端，我們的嗜好，何以這樣相同呢」她在月光之下，看見那個人走了過來。他潮濕的衣服；還緊緊地貼在身上，鞋上沾滿了泥水，還沒有刷去。「天下事還有比這個更有趣的嗎？」他說。</p>
<p>他在慕爾娜的窗户下面靜聽齊林諾的「愛情的樂趣」會兒他去了，隔了一些時，有一飛機從薩慈堡的飛行塲振翼而去。</p>
<p>明天晚上，慕爾娜仍舊在她的屋子裏聽齊林諾的「愛情的樂趣」忽然花園裏發生一種提琴的聲音來。音調同唱片上的一般無二，不過還要清越些，還要逼眞些。她關了留聲機器，斜倚在窗口靜聽</p>
<p>「齊林諾」！她驚喜地向她的侍女說。「這一定係齊林諾他自己。」她趕緊地下樓梯向花園中行去。（未完）</p>

<p>(Běipíng) Artillery fire was heard in Qíndǎo this morning more than twenty times. The Japanese 8th Division stationed in Jǐnxī launched three general offensives against Zhèng Guìlín's troops in recent days, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses.

<p>(Běipíng) Jiǔménkǒu remains in a state of blockade, and morale is extremely high. At noon on the 12th, the enemy, with the Miyake, Hayakawa, and Moshui cavalry regiments, launched a sudden advance on Jiǔménkǒu, and the battle was fierce. The troops defending the pass were the Hé cavalry regiment. Our army firmly defended Jiǔménkǒu, and the enemy cavalry attacked several times but were repulsed. The defenses of Shíménzhài, Shíhé, and Liǔjiāng have been linked together and are extremely solid. (14th)</p>
<p>(Běipíng) After the Japanese side intends to blockade the various fortresses of Yúguān, it will use its full force to attack Rèhé and resolve the Liaoxi volunteer army. The headquarters for attacking Rèhé plans to be established in Jǐnzhōu. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Běipíng) Zhèng Guìlín stated that the Japanese side is blockading Jiǔménkǒu, cutting off contact between our regular army and the volunteer army, and then eliminating our volunteer army headquarters. North of Jiǔménkǒu, there are still routes such as Wúmíngkǒu, Dàmáoshānkǒu, Yìyuànkǒu, and Jièwàikǒu that can be used for passage. The Japanese army outside the pass has not been able to blockade them all, so the Japanese attack on Jiǔménkǒu does not have much impact on our army. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tiānjīn) The enemy is building artillery forts at Jiǎoshān, Cháoyángdòng, and Èrlángmiào, north of Yúchéng, to defend against our army's counterattack.

(Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Qínhuángdǎo) The situation here remains peaceful, but quite tense. Public opinion generally believes that the later the official negotiations on the Yú case begin, the more likely the Sino-Japanese incident is to worsen. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Massing in Língcháo Counties, Planning a Major Invasion of Rèhé</h3>

<h3>Rumors of Dīng Chāo's Capture</h3>
<p>(Hā'ěrbīn) Dīng Chāo was captured yesterday, presumably intercepted by the Japanese while en route to Russia. Dīng was surrounded by Japanese soldiers from Jiāmùsī and Fùjǐn, a few miles south of Bǎoqīng. Dīng and his entourage were unable to escape and surrendered. The Japanese are currently negotiating with him, hoping to cooperate with the Japanese side, but Dīng has not yet agreed. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Has Reached Its Most Critical Juncture; The Special Committee of Nineteen Will Meet Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chairman Hymans Arrives in Geneva to Continue Mediation Efforts</p>
<p>A New Compromise Plan Completely Catered to Japanese Intentions and Is Unlikely to Materialize</p>
<p>The General Assembly Will Prepare a Report Based on the Covenant</p>
<p>Our Representatives Have Had Considerable Contact with the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Nánjīng) Diplomatic sources say that after the League of Nations despaired of mediation, it had been brewing a new compromise plan. Because Japan insisted on recognizing the puppet organization and direct negotiations, which we strongly opposed, the General Assembly will still draft a report based on Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. The content will be entirely based on the Lytton Report. Our representatives Yán, Gù, and Guō have had considerable contact with the League of Nations. If, after the meeting of the Special Committee of Nineteen on the 16th, it is generally recognized that mediation is hopeless, the report will be submitted. After being passed by a majority, it will be submitted to the League of Nations Council for discussion. The international atmosphere has reached its most critical juncture. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nánjīng) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received telegrams from Yán, Gù, Guō, and others, stating that the League of Nations Special Committee, fearing that the Sino-Japanese dispute could not be mediated, has begun drafting a report based on Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant, adopting the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report and the new facts that have occurred between China and Japan in recent months, and making appropriate recommendations. In their telegrams, Yán, Gù, and others described the contents of the report in detail and requested instructions from the government on how to respond. The contents have not yet been disclosed. The government's reply to Yán, Gù, and others is scheduled to be sent before the meeting of the Special Committee of Nineteen on the 16th. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the situation in the League of Nations is very tense. Special Committee Chairman Hymans and Secretary-General Drummond have been urging the Chinese and Japanese delegations to negotiate in recent days, and there are indeed major developments brewing. The meeting is scheduled to open on the 16th, first hearing statements from representatives of both China and Japan, and then discussing whether the issue can be mediated. If it is considered that mediation is no longer possible, a report must be submitted, implementing Section 4 of Article 15 for effective sanctions. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Negotiations are currently underway between the Japanese representative and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond in an effort to seek a solution regarding a proposal for the Special Committee of Nineteen that would be acceptable to Japan. Some progress has now been made toward a compromise. Part of the reason for this progress is a change in the form of the explanatory memorandum. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Special Conference of the League of Nations Chairman Hymans, the foreign minister, arrived here at 12:00 this morning, scheduling to visit Drummond tomorrow morning to inquire about the progress of League of Nations negotiations with Japan, and the content of the Anglo-Japanese compromise plan drafted by Drummond and Sugimura. It is heard that Hymans is well aware that the plan is a clear British appeasement of Japan, and many small countries are dissatisfied with the plan, so he cannot but conduct careful research. (Huálian Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations General Assembly Special Conference Chairman Hymans arrived here tonight, so the mediation work of the Far East incident will begin immediately. Hymans will soon visit both the Chinese and Japanese delegations to explore whether the governments of both countries have the possibility of accepting the resolution drafted by the Committee of Nineteen. Then decide on the direction of progress. However, according to the current situation, neither side has the possibility of accepting this resolution, so Hymans may again discuss the important principles with the Committee of Nineteen to determine which direction to proceed in. The Committee of Nineteen will reconvene on Sunday to discuss whether to insist on the original resolution or change it to seek the establishment of mediation. However, as there have been great changes in the Far East incident in recent days, almost everyone in the League of Nations doubts the League of Nations' ability to resolve the Manchuria case itself.

<h3>The Content of the New Compromise Plan Reported by the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>Organize a Five-Nation Committee to Conduct Mediation</p>
<p>Completely Ignores the Non-Recognition of the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>No Clear Provisions for Inviting the United States and Russia to Participate</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation held another summit meeting at 3:00 PM on the 13th. After Deputy Minister Sugimura reported the results of the negotiations with Drummond, the participants exchanged opinions and decided to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and request instructions. It is heard that the points of understanding reached between Sugimura and Drummond are as follows: 1) The organization of the mediation committee is limited to the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium. China and Japan do not participate. 2) The issue of inviting the United States and Russia is not canceled, but clear words such as "the United States and Russia" are not used. Only "member states and non-member states that have interests in the Sino-Japanese issue" are expressed, and the United States and Russia will be invited in the future. 3) The phrase "direct negotiations" is not used, but the spirit of direct negotiations is recognized. The mediation committee has the authority to assist in the fundamental and thorough resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>4) The issue of reasoning abandons the form of a reasoning and serves as a declaration by the chairman. Therefore, the final paragraph denying the word "Manchukuo" is decided to be deleted. 5) The League of Nations General Assembly continues until the Sino-Japanese issue is resolved. The mediation committee reports to the General Assembly when necessary to show that the League of Nations has a full relationship with the Sino-Japanese issue. (Japanese News Agency Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The full text of the League of Nations Secretariat's proposal was received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>Every resolution, Article 1: If the League of Nations, in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the Covenant, its first task is to strive to mediate disputes, and today's situation indicates that the time for advising on the facts and solutions of the dispute has not yet been reached. Article 2: In accordance with the resolution of March 11, 1932, the League of Nations' principles on this matter are declared, so considering the principles of Chapter 9 of the Lytton Investigation Team Report as a powerful basis for resolving this matter. Article 4: These principles have the task of deciding whether or not to apply them to the development of the situation in the Far East, so Article 5: In order to adjust the dispute, the Committee of Nineteen appoints a small committee. Article 6: In order to determine the resolution of the pending issues between the two countries, the small committee assists the two parties and recognizes that the small committee has the authority to take all necessary measures to fulfill its mission and the ability to invite representatives of non-member states to participate. Article 7: The small committee should continuously provide information to the Committee of Nineteen on the matter before March 1, so that the Committee of Nineteen can report to the General Assembly. Article 8: The Committee of Nineteen, in accordance with the period of hesitation expressed in the resolution of July 1932, has the authority to decide with the consent of the two parties. If the two parties do not agree on this period of hesitation, the Special Committee of Nineteen, when the General Assembly entrusts its business to the final report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, should present it to the League of Nations General Assembly. Article 9: The League of Nations General Assembly will continue to be convened whenever the chairman deems it necessary. Second Resolution: The League of Nations General Assembly thanks the League of Nations Investigation Committee for its useful assistance to the League of Nations, and declares that the Investigation Team Report is a useful contribution to the League of Nations' efforts to maintain peace.

<h3>Excerpts from Our Delegation's Message to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The Conflict Caused by the Japanese Army Occupying Yú</p>
<p>Declares That China Is Not Responsible</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation sent the full text of the note that the Chinese government sent to the countries that signed the 1901 Protocol (i.e., the Boxer Protocol) on January 11 to the League of Nations Secretariat, stating that Japan abused the privileges contained in the 1901 Protocol, Japanese troops attacked Shānhǎiguān and occupied it, and massacred thousands of innocent residents and destroyed a large amount of property inside and outside the city. Japanese troops are also concentrated around Shānhǎiguān and along the Běiníng Railway. Under these circumstances, China has to declare that the Chinese army is exercising its right of self-defense against the Japanese army's acts of aggression, and will not bear any responsibility for the events that occur in law or in fact as a result. At the request of the Chinese delegation, the League of Nations Secretariat has distributed this letter to all member states of the Extraordinary Assembly. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japan Expresses Optimism</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations' compromise proposal for Japan is currently being reviewed by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses its agreement, Chairman Hymans will report on the progress and read the chairman's statement. As a result, the Committee of Nineteen will hand over the Sino-Japanese dispute to the Five-Nation Conference. If Japan requests further revisions of minor issues, it will be necessary to suspend the meeting on the 16th and revise it after Hymans and Drummond consult. However, it must be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen for review and decision. If Japan requests fundamental revisions, the League of Nations cannot but resort to Article 15, Paragraph 4 to forcibly mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is heard that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the League of Nations has succumbed to Japan and is quite optimistic about the future. (Huálian Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Insists on Direct Negotiations and Opposes Third-Party Intervention</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The attitude that the Japanese government should take towards Secretary-General Drummond's method of resolving the Sino-Japanese issue is currently being carefully discussed by the leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The content of the proposal is quite close to Japan's claims. However, the Japanese side intends to request restrictions on the powers of the new committee monitoring the Sino-Japanese incident and continue negotiations with Drummond according to the following policies: 1) The new committee's discussion items stipulated in the Drummond proposal are the items in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report. Its task lacks clarity, and there is a section on permitting Manchurian autonomy. Japan certainly cannot recognize it, so it is required to be revised to the part of Chapter 9 that is beneficial for the new committee to discuss. 2) If it is inconvenient to clearly record the above conditions in the text, the committee's actual work should be clearly stipulated not to be based on the above conditions. 3) There is also a contradiction in the issue of inviting non-member states in the resolution, that is, the resolution stipulates that the small committee acts in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. However, if the United States and Russia are added, the League of Nations will exceed the scope of its obligation to assist Sino-Japanese direct negotiations, and it cannot avoid partially contradicting itself, so this point must be canceled. 4) Drummond himself proposed that the new committee use the principles of the Lytton Report in the situation in the Far East, which contradicts the section in a certain previous chapter that respects Sino-Japanese direct negotiations, so its application or interpretation should be left to the two parties, China and Japan. 5) The Sino-Japanese issue must be resolved through direct negotiations between China and Japan. The League of Nations Committee can only observe and must not intervene. (Allied News Agency Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Spain Replaces Its Representative to the League of Nations for Fear of Offending Japan</h3>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish government announced today that Madariaga could not go to Geneva due to illness, and Xī Lā was appointed to represent Spain at the Committee of Nineteen and the Special Conference of the League of Nations to discuss the Manchurian case. It is said that Madariaga had a severe cold before, and now he has gradually recovered and is recuperating on the French Riviera. However, according to reliable sources, the change of the Spanish representative due to illness is just an excuse, in fact, because the Spanish government is dissatisfied with Madariaga's actions in Geneva last time that exceeded his authority. And it is heard that Foreign Minister Sulote may soon go to Geneva himself. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Inviting the United States to Participate Becomes a Problem Between Britain and Japan</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to the intelligence of the Japanese delegation, regarding the composition of the small committee established according to the secretariat's proposal, it is now known that Secretary-General Drummond, in addition to the five countries of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium, is requesting the participation of the United States and not allowing China and Japan to join, and most hopes for the participation of the United States. The advocate is the United Kingdom, and its reason is that the United Kingdom has a majority of colonies in the Far East. On the Far East policy, it says that cooperation with the United States is essential and indispensable. However, the Japanese government believes that the participation of the United States, allowing non-member states that have no responsibility under the Covenant to join the League of Nations' agencies, and giving them the right to speak without being responsible, is not only questionable in the legal principles of the League of Nations, but also in practical influence, it only encourages China's improper spirit of using barbarians to control barbarians, making the peaceful resolution of the problem difficult to delay, so it expresses absolute disagreement. Therefore, the problem will be separated from Japan's relationship with the League of Nations and become a problem between Britain and Japan, so its progress is worth noting.

<h3>Secret Anglo-French Agreement During Shanghai Battle Permitted Non-Interference in Manchuria Problem</h3>
<p>Another Act of International Treachery</p>
<p>Precedent Existed During the European War</p>
<p>World Society Translation, "Miller's Review" Reports: According to news from Geneva, when Japanese troops withdrew from Shanghai, Britain and France secretly permitted Japan not to interfere with the Manchurian problem. Whether this news is accurate cannot be determined, but based on past events, this action seems quite possible and worthy of attention from everyone concerned about this issue. According to rumors, Britain and France apparently had huge interests in Shanghai, and the Japanese attack caused significant damage to these interests, so they were willing to allow Japan free rein in Manchuria if it withdrew from Shanghai. This rumor seems quite credible. Why? Because a similar act of treacherous dishonesty occurred during the Great War. At that time, the European powers, including Britain and France, secretly allowed Japan to occupy Shandong as a reward if Japan could help them defeat Germany. The perfidy and dishonesty of these secret agreements were extreme because they were made when European countries and the United States were trying to persuade China to declare war on Germany. Thus, the European countries extended one hand to befriend China while stabbing it in the back with the other. At the time, the United States, with a clear attitude, went to war against Germany and had no idea that the European countries had a secret agreement with Japan allowing it to occupy Shandong, which was absolutely contrary to American policy. It wasn't until President Wilson arrived in Versailles for peace negotiations that these sordid treaties regarding the Japanese occupation of Shandong were revealed one by one. Therefore, China refused to sign the peace treaty, as did the United States. Given the above background, the rumor that certain European countries have a secret agreement with Japan regarding Manchuria today is quite believable, and the indignation of Chinese public opinion is not surprising.</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party's Pro-Japan Stance is Clear</h3>
<p>(London) Conservative Party members still maintain a reserved attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute and seek opportunities to bring China and Japan closer together. Today's editorial in The Times, discussing the Manchurian issue, expresses hope that the Sino-Japanese dispute will not extend to mainland China. The newspaper says that Japan is determined to occupy Manchuria by force, and when considering the Manchurian issue, we should not focus on what is just or unjust. Japanese soldiers in Manchuria are closely watching the attitude of Tang Yulin, Chairman of Jehol. Japanese soldiers advocate the establishment of a neutral zone, which, from many perspectives, is very feasible. The method of a neutral zone can be promoted in other parts of the world. Japan's plan can be regarded as a manifestation of a spirit of compromise. The newspaper also says that under the current circumstances, it may not be possible to reach a compromise to resolve all the issues in the dispute immediately. The best approach is to gradually eliminate the difficulties. Once the difficulties are gradually eliminated, the minds of China and Japan can also be gradually harmonized. Therefore, I believe that Zhang Xueliang somewhat agrees with the Japanese proposal for an on-the-spot resolution of the Shanhaiguan incident. Not only is this reassuring on important points, but it can also create a good example. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>French Parliament Questions the Far East Problem</h3>
<p>France Still Maintains a Friendly Policy Towards Japan</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Chamber of Deputies, due to many members requesting to raise questions about the Far East problem and the Sino-Japanese dispute, convened a meeting at 6 PM today. Prime Minister Pierre-Étienne Flandin said that the date for discussing these questions would depend on the progress of the work about to begin in Geneva, and it was difficult to predict when this work could be completed. Socialist member Flandin declared that Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931, and in March 1932, it made Manchuria independent to split China. It now intends to advance into Jehol. All these actions violate the treaties that it formally signed and recognized in Geneva. These matters are very serious, so the Chamber of Deputies should discuss this issue before the meeting in Geneva. Right-wing member Mr. de Tarde stated that the League of Nations Covenant applies to organized countries, and within China, there is more than one entity that can be regarded as a country, such as Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Yunnan. As for Japan, it has economically managed Manchuria, spending no less than tens of billions of dollars. Japan's rights are recognized by treaty, and Japan is "the guardian of peace in the Far East." The French government's policy of understanding towards Japan cannot be changed. Prime Minister Flandin then took the stage and said, "It is clearly inconvenient to discuss the issues raised by you before the meeting in Geneva. I hope the parliament agrees with this view. The Sino-Japanese affair has been submitted to the League of Nations for handling in accordance with the articles of the League of Nations Covenant. The Covenant stipulates methods of mediation and instructs the League of Nations to judge who is right and who is wrong. New incidents are happening now, and it is inappropriate to ask the government to express its feelings about these incidents." Flandin only agreed to explain the French government's general attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute, briefly saying, "When France encounters such situations, its attitude is solely guided by legal principles. Some criticize the League of Nations, saying that its progress is slow and ineffective. This may lead people to believe that France's proposal for the disarmament conference is well-founded, as France has suggested reforming the League of Nations, giving it the power to implement its resolutions. However, even in its current state, we should not underestimate the effectiveness of the League of Nations, as it has resolved many international disputes. Among them, some cases were resolved by the League of Nations before they were even brewing, eliminating potential problems without outside knowledge. The effectiveness of the League of Nations may not be entirely satisfactory, but its actions are still commendable. The cessation of hostilities in Shanghai was indeed due to the mediation of the League of Nations, which we should not forget. The Manchurian problem is extremely complex. Our friendly policy towards Japan is indeed a fact. However, China is a country undergoing transformation. It is extremely difficult for such a country to carry out transformation. France, having gone through many revolutions to reach its present state, cannot underestimate these difficulties. France in the League of Nations is purely motivated by justice and peace. France is a country that judges right and wrong in this matter. If it is influenced by any secret agreement, is there still room for reason and the League of Nations to exist? The Sino-Japanese dispute is becoming increasingly serious, and we are deeply concerned. We will first take measures to ease tensions in the name of the League of Nations, then strive to mediate, and constantly cite the League of Nations Covenant. Everything we say is based on the provisions of the Covenant, and we have never failed to fully invoke all the provisions of the Covenant." After Flandin finished speaking, the Chamber of Deputies decided to postpone the discussion of this question. The meeting adjourned at 7:15 PM. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<h3>Philippine Independence Denied Ominous</h3>
<p>(1) Deteriorating US-Japan Relations</p>
<p>The situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly urgent. Everyone knows that, but with the US presidential election coming up, the White House will have a new master after March 4 this year. US foreign policy cannot be entirely unchanged. However, the United States of America, with its national strength and abundant resources, has firmly held the reins of world finance since the First World War. However, since the outbreak of the economic panic in the fall of 1929, it has become increasingly deep. It was not until after June last year, during the presidential election campaign, that a turning point was seen, and everyone celebrated, thinking that the panic had reached its lowest point and that prosperity would gradually return. However, the prosperity of the United States has impacted Europe, Canada, and South American countries. However, European countries have not cleared their war debts and are unwilling to remain under the control of the US dollar for long. Canada is a member of the British Empire's economic alliance and certainly wants to break away from US economic constraints. South America is plagued by unrest, and US dollar investments have been hit. In the future, the ideal market for the United States will be China, surrounded by powerful countries. However, it has no special economic foundation or military base in China. How can it consolidate its economic power and seek development through consolidation? However, US trade with China, according to the year-end summary last year, totaled 250,276,000 Haikwan taels in exports to China. Except for the combined total of British India and Hong Kong, it actually ranked first among all countries importing into China. Therefore, even if it cannot use military force to protect its economic interests in China, it will never lightly abandon its existing military support points in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party, to fulfill its political promises, advocated for the early independence of the Philippines. After the US Congress passed a resolution, the US President, in his letter to Congress on the 13th, said, "I firmly believe that an independent Philippine nation will be unable to resist the armed invasion or peaceful immigration of Far Eastern nations." He also said, "This proposal is impractical, unsound in terms of economics, and particularly dangerous from an international standpoint." The so-called "armed invasion" specifically refers to the "armed invasion of Far Eastern nations." In the current Far East, there is no second country that can use force and rely solely on its force to invade other nations other than Japanese imperialism. This statement is very clear. The attitude of the United States is also evident from this.</p>
<p>(2) Japan Actively Advances, US Will Have No Room to Stand</p>
<p>Japan has already occupied the three northeastern provinces by force and taken control of the Black River Basin (the granary of the Far East). If the development of Manchuria is as successful as desired, the impoverished Japan will have sufficient combat capabilities. The Chinese market and the dominant position in the Western Pacific will belong to Japan, as it has the advantage of the situation and the support of material resources. Recently, it has actively invaded North China, attempting to solve the problem of raw materials necessary for its textile industry (cotton and wool) in one fell swoop. Japan, taking advantage of the fact that the world economic panic has not yet recovered and that the United States is anxious about its domestic economic recovery, is recruiting troops and buying horses, summoning all division commanders and regimental commanders of infantry, cavalry, and aviation, as well as independent battalions of transport troops and heavy artillery, more than 260 people, to hold secret meetings and implement major military reforms. On the naval front, various types of warships are also being mobilized, from dreadnought battleships to new sharp cruisers, submarines, aircraft carriers, etc. The entire navy is mobilized, from the Caroline Islands in the South Seas and the Ogasawara Islands to Yokosuka in the north and the Penghu Islands in the west, for an unprecedented large-scale naval exercise. What is its intention? What is its purpose? It does not require experts to know that its target is the United States.</p>
<p>The United States has already reached its peak and only wants to maintain its current position and restore its past prosperity. Unexpectedly, Japan is closing in step by step, having already obtained the three northeastern provinces and engaging in reckless monopolization. It wants to have absolute control over the "North China market," turning the current North China into Manchuria before the September 18th Incident, and then fully develop its continental policy, encompassing East Asia. Even in its current state, the hegemony of the Western Pacific has fallen into the hands of Japan.</p>
<p>The United States' only Asian fleet in the Far East has only one 10,000-ton cruiser, one aircraft carrier, nineteen destroyers, twelve gunboats, twelve submarines, and one each of submarine minelayers and submarine tenders. In addition, there are five minesweepers. The army has 11,000 soldiers, 6,700 troops, and 250 aircraft. This small force, once invaded by a foreign enemy, can only hold out for a short time even with excellent defensive works. It is difficult to maintain its superior position in China and expand its market. Therefore, since last year, it has concentrated its entire naval fleet in the Pacific Ocean. The facts show that it does not necessarily have the determination to challenge but is only preparing for the possibility of a Japanese invasion, striving to maintain its economic advantage on the west coast of the Pacific. However, Japan's power cannot be underestimated, and it is also closely allied with Britain to divide East Asia. This situation is something that the United States cannot tolerate today. The United States, which wants to compete for hegemony in the Pacific, not only refuses to abandon its naval base in the Philippines, allowing it to become independent, but may also intensify its defensive works. It will also rebuild the fortress on Guam. Therefore, today's denial of the Philippine independence proposal is the prelude to its "resistance to armed aggression" and the harbinger of a future Pacific war.</p>
<h3>Secret Meeting Between US and Russian Consuls in Manzhouli</h3>
<p>(Changchun) According to Japanese sources, the US Consul General stationed in Harbin went to Manzhouli yesterday and met with the Russian Consul in Manzhouli for a secret discussion lasting about forty minutes. The content was extremely confidential. Although Japanese military police tried their best to investigate, they could not obtain any information. (China United Press, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military's Expanded Aggression Causes Deep Anxiety in the United States</h3>
<p>(New York) Yesterday, the British Ambassador to Japan visited Japanese Foreign Minister Kōsai Uchida regarding the Shanhaiguan Incident. According to The New York Times, the State Department does not want to order the US Ambassador to Japan to make a similar visit. According to Secretary of State Stimson, the British Ambassador's visit is sufficient, but people here are very uneasy about Japan's expansion of occupied areas to Tianjin and Beijing. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Celebrities Sign Petition Urging Japan to Abandon the Puppet State</h3>
<p>(London) Today, various newspapers published a letter arguing that if Japan insists on not withdrawing its recognition of "Manchukuo," the League of Nations General Assembly should promptly prepare a detailed report of the facts in accordance with Article 15, Section 4 of the League of Nations Covenant. The signatories to this letter include several important British figures, such as the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of Ripon and Salisbury, school principals, and prominent writers such as H.G. Wells, former Labor Minister Margaret Bondfield, and literary figure Gilbert Murray. The letter states that Japan intends to defy the League of Nations Covenant, and its current invasion of Jehol is clearly the starting point. The signatories believe that recognition of "Manchukuo" is greatly detrimental to the League of Nations and the collective security system. The League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact are both tools of this collective security system. If Japan refuses to accept the principles of negotiated settlement proposed by the Committee of Nineteen and still believes that Japan's recognition of "Manchukuo" has created an irreversible fact, the League of Nations General Assembly should promptly issue a report in accordance with Article 15, Section 4, explaining the facts in dispute and putting forward recommendations regarding this matter. The signatories believe that this report should follow the outline of the Lytton Report and clearly declare opposition to the recognition of "Manchukuo." The League of Nations General Assembly should quickly study the overall situation with this perspective in mind to see what further actions are needed. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italy Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>Rome The situation in Manchuria is now causing increasing anxiety among Italian people. No one dares to believe that the current truce will last long. Everyone fears that a wider range of war will occur. Officials do not comment on reports that Britain intends to mediate. There is also no indication of what action Italy will take, but everyone believes that Italy will probably not take any action. Public opinion generally believes that Britain's initiative is commendable in principle, but this move is easily rejected. The entire Western powers are also involved. This problem was originally a problem that the League of Nations should handle, so the initiative should be taken by the League of Nations. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>At the Opening of Parliament, Foreign Minister Kōsai Uchida of Japan Will Deliver a Wild Speech</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The 64th Diet will reconvene on the 21st, which has a delicate relationship with the Committee of Nineteen in Geneva. Therefore, Foreign Minister Uchida's diplomatic speech will be the focus of world attention. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday completed drafting the speech drafts on matters under the jurisdiction of the Treaty, European, American, and Asian Commerce Bureaus. In the afternoon at 5 o'clock, Vice Minister Akira Ariyoshi, bureau directors, and the information director gathered to hold a ministry meeting to review the content and make decisions. It will be submitted to the cabinet meeting for final decision at the end of the coming week. The final paragraph of his speech, regarding constructive opinions on the China issue, will be revealed as follows: (1) The Imperial Government takes the coordination of the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchuria as a principle. All Far East problems, as well as diplomatic cases with European and American countries, will be adjusted according to this principle. We aim to promote international friendship through autonomous agreements. "Manchukuo" is growing in satisfaction, and we hope that the countries and the League of Nations will abandon their criticisms of the Imperial Government's attitude and focus on the Imperial Government's fair measures.

<p>Philippine Independence Bill Passes House Over Presidential Veto</p>
<p>Hoover Will Rest for a Year After Leaving Office Before Returning to Public Affairs</p>
<p>National Press, Washington, 13th. After President Hoover's veto message on the Philippine independence bill was sent to Congress, the House of Representatives, within an hour, repassed the original bill with 274 votes to 94, overturning the President's veto. Only 93 Republicans and 1 Democrat supported Hoover's plan, while 193 Democrats, 80 Republicans, and 1 Farmer-Labor member supported the original bill. After the President's veto message was read in the House, the debate began immediately. The original proposer, Hare, stated that the legislative history of the Philippine independence issue is a kind of ambiguity. If the President's veto is maintained, the people of the East will regard the American people as cowardly. After an hour of debate, the original bill was repassed by a majority of more than two-thirds. On the Senate side, the President's veto message will likely be discussed on Saturday.</p>

<p>Record of a Lone Army in the Frontier</p>
<p>丨A Glimpse of the Current Situation of the Anti-Japanese Army in Heilongjiang Province丨</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Harbin)</p>
<p>Since Ma Zhanshan first raised the banner of righteousness in Heilongjiang Province, righteous armies in various places have responded enthusiastically. They have fought for years in the frozen land, despite the lack of supplies and support. Although they have suffered repeated setbacks, they have continued to fight bravely. Their arduous efforts are truly shocking and awe-inspiring, terrifying the enemy and surprising the world. At the end of September, Su Bingwen launched an uprising in Manzhouli, and righteous armies from various units gathered to respond. They assembled their forces in Heilongjiang and their momentum was great. However, they were ultimately defeated due to their lack of troops and strength, and their inability to withstand the pressure of the Japanese artillery fire. Looking at the rivers and mountains, enemy cavalry were rampant. Thinking of the people in the interior who were enjoying themselves without a care, while this lone army in the frontier was supporting the precarious situation, being defeated one by one by the enemy, we who live outside the customs truly feel like crying without tears. Now, we will record one or two aspects of the current situation of the Anti-Japanese Army in Heilongjiang Province and mail them to the people of the country, so that they may know that in the remote regions of Heilongjiang, tens of thousands of brave soldiers are fighting hard against the enemy for the survival of our entire nation.</p>
<p>㈠ The Process of Su and Ma Joining Forces to Attack Heilongjiang</p>
<p>Since Ma Zhanshan's retreat to eastern Heilongjiang, he has been preparing for a counterattack every day. He launched two general offensives against Heilongjiang, but both were unsuccessful due to lack of support. On October 20th of this year, General Ma launched a third general offensive, secretly ordering righteous armies from various units to besiege the provincial capital from multiple directions. The western route (northwestern line of the Chinese Eastern Railway) was taken by Su Bingwen's Zhang Dianjiu army, which launched operations in advance in places such as Fularji and Yaokule. Su's troops were all brave and good at fighting, with accurate shooting and excellent swordsmanship. The Japanese army was terrified at the sound of killing. When the time for the general offensive arrived, Pu Bingshan led his entire army of over ten thousand men from Baiquan to attack Taian Town on the Qiqihar line of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They fought fiercely for thirteen days, killing many enemies, but eventually retreated to Nehe due to running out of ammunition. At the same time, General Ma's main force also advanced from Nehe to the Raha station on the northeastern line, fighting fiercely for ten days and nights, killing over two hundred enemies, but also retreated to Nehe due to running out of food and ammunition. As for Li Haiqing's unit, which was originally tasked with attacking Angangxi on the southern route, and Deng Wen's unit, which was tasked with attacking the southeastern route, both were unable to take action due to the widespread flooding and thin ice in the southeast, which was not conducive to military operations. Otherwise, with a five-pronged advance, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang would not have been difficult to capture in one fell swoop. At this point, the Japanese army, seeing that our army was all taking a defensive posture, secretly transferred a large army from Yalu County (Zalantun) to attack the rear of Su's army. At the same time, the Japanese army on the southeastern front marched directly from Gannan County to Zalantun, with two thousand infantrymen, travelling on a hundred cars, and five hundred large horse-drawn carts, carrying large quantities of ammunition. Following them were three thousand cavalry. On the western and northern fronts, troops marched from Jingxingzhen to Zalantun, with three thousand infantrymen, two thousand cavalry, and countless munitions. On the front, five thousand infantrymen set out from Zishan, and used thirty airplanes in the air to bomb Zalantun. In addition, it was rumored that three thousand cavalrymen crossed the Greater Khingan Mountains and attacked Mandu River directly. In total, the enemy forces numbered 18,000, pressing in from all sides. The situation of the righteous army was extremely critical, but they remained calm and fought back without panic. They held out for five days and nights before the righteous army began to retreat. However, the Japanese army also suffered heavy casualties, with about a thousand or more deaths. At this point, Su Bingwen retreated to Russian territory, and Ma Zhanshan also retreated to the border of Heilongjiang. Xu Guo is rising again.</p>
<p>㈡ The Current Anti-Japanese Forces in Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>After the defeat of Su and Ma's anti-Japanese armies, some people may think that the righteous armies in Heilongjiang Province have now been completely wiped out. This is a great misconception. The current righteous armies in Heilongjiang Province still have considerable strength, and their anti-Japanese spirit has not diminished slightly due to the defeat of Su and Ma. The current strength of the righteous armies in Heilongjiang Province and their efforts to continue fighting will be detailed below. ㈠ Although Ma Zhanshan's three offensives against Heilongjiang failed, his strength was not significantly damaged. Ma's troops, such as Xu Zihe's, Xu Jingde's, and Brigade Commander Tai's units, number 15,000 men. Each of these three units has its own strengths in tactics. Xu Zihe's unit is known for its broadsword teams, Xu Jingde's unit is Ma's basic army and has achieved many military exploits, and Tai's unit excels in both military and party-state affairs. Other units, such as Deng Wen's unit, currently have 20,000 soldiers, with strict discipline, and often manage to awaken various puppet troops to revolt. Pu Bingshan's unit currently has over four thousand men and is known for its artillery skills. Li Haiqing's unit has 10,000 soldiers and has repeatedly defeated strong enemies in attacking cities and seizing land. Song Xihe's brigade currently has five thousand men and is also brave and good at fighting. According to statistics, although the various units have gone through several major battles, they still have a force of 54,000 men. ㈡ 3,000 men from Su Bingwen's unit retreated into Russian territory, and another 7,000 men retreated to a certain mountain. Therefore, at present, the righteous armies in Heilongjiang Province still number 64,000 men. Although Su and Ma have retreated, the various unit commanders are still actively operating and planning a counterattack. It is a pity that there is no support from the rear, and they lack both supplies and ammunition. Although they have the will to resist Japan, they ultimately suffer from having no weapons to die for.</p>
<p>㈢ Facing Hunger and Cold in the Snowy and Frozen Land</p>
<p>The righteous army is isolated in the frontier, fighting against the enemy with their flesh and blood. Their situation is tragic and painful, unprecedented in the world. The difficulty of supplying them is especially the Achilles' heel of the righteous army. Now, a few difficult situations are briefly described to show a glimpse of their life. ㈠ In terms of weapons, they feel deeply lacking because they have been fighting for years without any resupply. They must be quickly resupplied now in order to continue to cope with the Japanese army's advance. ㈡ There is a complete lack of good food in Tongbei, Dedu, Longmen, and other counties in the northeastern part of Heilongjiang Province. Most of the farmers have moved elsewhere, and the army is even filling its hunger with bean cakes (fodder for horses). The lack of food can be imagined. ㈢ It is cold and early in the border region. Snow is already flying in early winter. Two-tenths of the righteous army are still wearing unlined clothing, unlined hats, and unlined shoes. The climate is at 30 degrees below zero. How can they withstand the cold with such thin military clothing? The difficulties of the righteous army can be imagined. Although the righteous army is in this difficult situation, their determination to resist Japan is becoming even more intense. There is a song in the army that says, "The volunteer army doesn't earn money. They don't have shoes (northern winter shoes) or hats. Their feet are swollen from the cold and their faces are rotten, only for the sake of saving the country. I am willing to kill a Japanese soldier, I am willing, I am willing." Their heroic spirit pierces the sky.</p>
<p>㈣ A Glimpse of the Achievements of the Righteous Army in Resisting Japan</p>
<p>Although the righteous army has suffered repeated defeats, the Japanese army has also suffered great sacrifices. Not only have the Japanese troops sustained heavy casualties, but they have also suffered significant losses in terms of politics and economy. Now, a few aspects are described. ㈠ In July and August, the Hu-Hai Railway and the central section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (Anda Station) and the western section were successively cut off by the righteous army, and traffic was disrupted for three or four months. At the same time, the telegraph lines were also cut off, and the enemy suffered losses of over ten thousand yuan per day. ㈡ The righteous army is active everywhere, and local order cannot be stabilized, so the Japanese puppets cannot establish their regime. ㈢ Because local order cannot be stabilized, the immigration plan is proceeding with great difficulty. In addition, due to the continued resistance of the righteous army, the national consciousness of the people is directly and indirectly promoted, and the momentum of resisting Japan is becoming increasingly intense, exhausting the Japanese army and giving them no peace. As for the number of Japanese army deaths, it has not been less than ten thousand people in the past year.</p>
<p>㈤ The Red Spears and Divine Arts Terrify the Enemy</p>
<p>In addition to the righteous army, there is also a Red Spear Society in the eastern provinces, which is entirely organized by rural farmers. The motivation for its organization is also entirely due to the oppression of the Japanese army. At present, this Red Spear Society occupies seven or eight tenths of the entire Heilongjiang Province. When facing the enemy, they hold long-handled spears and shout "Kill, kill, kill" continuously, claiming that they have the help of gods and that knives and guns cannot penetrate them. In reality, they are using this to embolden themselves. The talk of gods is just a pretense. However, the Japanese army is extremely afraid of them, calling them Iron Men (meaning that knives and guns cannot penetrate them). Some units of the righteous army have incorporated them, calling them "Martial Arts Teams," relying on their miraculous spear techniques to defeat strong enemies, often using eighty or ninety men to defeat three or four hundred Japanese soldiers. They can be called divinely brave. Most of the Red Spear Society is determined to resist Japan, but some are only concerned with protecting their villages.</p>
<p>㈥ Enemy Cavalry Run Rampant on the Edge of the Greater Khingan Mountains</p>
<p>The current Japanese army in Heilongjiang Province, such as the units of Matsuki, Hiraga, and Hiramatsu, has 5,800 troops stationed in the provincial capital (two-thirds cavalry, one-third infantry). There are 300 cavalry in Taian Town on the Qiqihar line, 300 cavalry in Keshan, 400 cavalry in Hailun on the Hu-Hai Railway, 250 in Suihua, 150 in Hulan, 150 in Baiquan, 150 in Duqingshan in the middle section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, 100 in Xiaohaizi, 100 in Angangxi, 100 in Fularji in the northwestern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, 100 in Lantun, 600 in Boketu, 600 in Hailar, 700 in Manzhouli, 500 in Ningnian Station on the northern branch line of the Qiqihar Railway, and 200 in Raha Station. In addition, there are more than 5,000 guerrillas. In total, the Japanese army in Heilongjiang Province numbers no less than 11,500 men. However, there are many changes in their deployment and rotation, so the above investigation is only an approximate estimate.</p>
<p>㈦ The Rivers and Mountains Change Color, but the Hearts of the People Have Not Died</p>
<p>We have repeatedly told the people of the country that the hearts of the people of the Northeast have not died. Now, we will describe another incident to show that the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people of the Northeast is becoming increasingly widespread and deeply rooted. In November, a reporter in the provincial capital encountered a pro-Japanese officer wearing a yellow armband, strutting through the streets. A child followed behind him, whispering "traitor" repeatedly. The officer felt ashamed and quickly removed the armband, hiding it in his clothes. I was greatly moved by this. Regardless of other things, this one incident shows that the Northeast has lost its name but remains alive in reality.</p>
<p>㈧ National Hero Ma Zhanshan on the Edge of the Heilong River</p>
<p>Various newspapers have repeatedly introduced General Ma Zhanshan's character and his wisdom and courage in resisting the enemy, and I believe the people of the country are already familiar with them. Now, I am willing to describe him again as I describe the righteous army in Heilongjiang Province. However, I am confident that every word and sentence of my introduction is objective and that there is absolutely no emotional relationship mixed in, and no words of flattery are used. This should be stated first. Ma is brave and resolute, with extraordinary talents. He always fights in the front lines, and even when artillery fire is raging, Ma never flinches. His will is especially strong. Although he has suffered repeated defeats, his determination to resist Japan has not only not diminished slightly but has become even stronger. Previously, in Heihe, I observed his residence. It faced the street, and his bed could be seen from the window. Some people asked him to move his bed to the inner room, but Ma said, "When I was on the front lines, I never looked back even when the Japanese army was fiercely bombing. Now that I live here, what am I afraid of?" His spirit surpasses everything. Ma did not study much when he was young, but he could keep a simple diary. When in the army, he always recorded the various violent acts of the Japanese army in a book, storing them as materials to report to the League of Nations. When his subordinates drafted documents, Ma always pointed out the flaws and added and deleted them himself, without missing anything. This is also his extraordinary wisdom, which cannot be matched. (December 29th)</p>
<p>The Northeast Problem and the League of Nations (10) (2)</p>
<p>The Debate on the Afternoon of the 24th</p>
<p>(The Chairman Invites Representative Gu to Speak)</p>
<p>The Chairman invited the Chinese representative to speak, and Dr. Gu Weijun, the representative of our country, rose and said, "During the meeting of the Executive Yuan yesterday afternoon, I promised to continue to express my opinions today regarding what the Japanese representative said. However, I will omit the details mentioned by the Japanese representative. The Chinese delegation will send a written statement to the Secretariat regarding these details to save the valuable time of the members of the Executive Yuan. We all know that lawyers in court, when handling cases that are difficult to defend, often like to divert the judge's attention to unimportant details. This is a common strategy used by lawyers. What the Japanese representative said yesterday disregarded the main issue and focused on unimportant details, and his strategy was similar. Before expressing my opinion on the main issue, I would also like to respond to one or two points mentioned by the Japanese representative."</p>
<p>(The Tanaka Memorial Fully Coincides with the Facts: The Japanese Representative Expresses Dissent to Me Regarding the Tanaka Memorial and Asks Me to Provide Evidence)</p>
<p>"As for whether such a document exists in Japan, probably no one can provide conclusive evidence except those who can enter and exit the document storage room in Tokyo. However, in my humble opinion, the most powerful evidence of this issue is the entire situation of the three northeastern provinces today. Moreover, I already stated yesterday that even if this memorial is forged, those who forged it are undoubtedly Japanese. Mr. Matsuoka probably agrees with this point, because in his recent book 'The Activity of Manchuria and Mongolia,' published in July 1913, on pages 33 to 36, he said, 'The origin of this Tanaka Memorial is said to have been forged by a certain foreigner living in Beijing, and there is some reliable evidence to prove this statement. However, I believe that this forged memorial was likely made by a certain Japanese and sold to a Chinese at a high price, and the Chinese who received the memorial believed it to be true.' I believe that there is no better defense for this point than to use the Japanese representative's spear to pierce his shield. The guarantee given by the Chinese authorities to Japan in 1930 that they would not encourage the circulation of this memorial was entirely a friendly consideration. At that time, they did not dream that the policies outlined in the memorial would be implemented tirelessly by Japan in recent years, and that the policies currently implemented by Japan in the three provinces are consistent with what is outlined in the memorial. I paid considerable attention to Prime Minister Tanaka's proactive policies yesterday, which can also be compared with what is outlined in the memorial. It should be known that the important point is in substance, not form. Since the Japanese representative attaches so much importance to the authenticity of the Tanaka Memorial, I respectfully request that the members of the Executive Yuan read the entire text of the memorial as soon as possible, so that they can make a detailed comparison between the points outlined in the memorial and the policies currently implemented by Japan, and then make a judgment on the true meaning of the document."</p>
<p>(Does Japan Truly Loathe Secret Agreements?)</p>
<p>"Another point that I would like to state to everyone is the Sino-Russian alliance treaty of 1856. The Japanese representative also made a lengthy criticism of this yesterday. We must know that this treaty was actually a precaution taken by the Chinese government after Japan obtained Korea in the Sino-Japanese War to prevent Japan from advancing further into Manchuria. The Japanese representative strongly criticized China's act of concluding this treaty, but I believe that Mr. Matsuoka's hatred for this matter is definitely not as severe as he says. Because Mr. Matsuoka, in his position as a representative of Japan, must know that Japan has concluded more secret treaties with other countries in the past thirty years than we know. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1907, Japan immediately signed a secret treaty with Russia, and then continued to conclude secret treaties in 1910, 1912, and 1916, the purpose of which was nothing more than to divide China's land and infringe on China's sovereignty. If Japan's tendency to conclude secret treaties were not so severe, then what Mr. Matsuoka said would undoubtedly be more convincing. In addition, there is another point."</p>
<p>(Facts Prove That Matsuoka is Lying)</p>
<p>"I would like to offer an explanation to the Japanese representative, namely a comparison of the living conditions of the Chinese people in the Yangtze River basin with the Chinese people in today's so-called 'Manchukuo.' Mr. Matsuoka claimed that the majority of the people in 'Manchukuo' are now living in peace and prosperity, which has never been the case before. However, China has just recently received many telegrams reporting on the situation in the three northeastern provinces. Please allow me to read them to everyone. On November 23rd, the Chinese delegation received a report regarding the events that occurred on the morning of September 16th, which reads:"</p>
<p>"'On the morning of September 16th, three members of the volunteer army went to the village to inquire about the route. After the Japanese authorities heard about this, they gathered 200 Japanese soldiers armed with machine guns and summoned the village chief of the village for questioning, because all the people in the village were suspected of having connections with the volunteer army. After the interrogation, they drove all the people of the village to the top of Pingdingshan Mountain, ordered them to sit down, and aimed machine guns at them. When some people were frightened and tried to stand up, the Japanese army opened fire and shot them dead.'"</p>
<p>"In this battle, over 700 residents of the village were killed, 60 to 70 were seriously injured, and over 130 were slightly injured. The three villages of Qianjinbao, Suzigou, and Pingdingshan were completely burned. Similar incidents also occurred on November 9th and 10th. The report received by the Chinese delegation stated:"</p>
<p>"'On November 9th, six Japanese military aircraft dropped bombs in the sky. The next day, 1,000 Japanese soldiers attacked, assisted by eight aircraft, four field guns, and two heavy cannons. Over 100 Chinese people were killed every day.'"</p>
<p>"Before accepting the Japanese representative's claim that the people of 'Manchukuo' are all enjoying peace and happiness, the members of the Executive Yuan should first consider these facts."</p>
<p>(Four "No"s Are Most Worth Noting)</p>
<p>"So what is the main issue in this case? We should first seek answers to several important questions. Was the incident of September 18th, 1931, an act of self-defense by Japan? Our answer is "No." Is the so-called 'Manchukuo' the result of a genuine independence movement by the Chinese people and based on the free will of the residents of the three northeastern provinces? Our answer is also "No." Although Japan has repeatedly promised the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations to withdraw its troops, have the Japanese troops actually withdrawn? Our answer is again "No." Has Japan stopped its military actions and prevented actions that would further escalate the situation? Our answer is still "No." Then this case can be resolved by peaceful means."</p>
<p>(The Investigation Report Has Become a Final Verdict)</p>
<p>"The above points are, in our opinion, the most important issues in this case and should be given the most attention when considering this Sino-Japanese dispute. In other words, the current facts before us are that a country that harbors traditional expansionist and aggressive policies, after completing its modern warfare tools and formulating its plan for military occupation of its neighbor's territory, began its aggression in accordance with its predetermined strategy, disregarding its obligations as a member of the League of Nations and a signatory to international peace treaties. Not only that, but the representative of that country has repeatedly promised the Executive Yuan that it would no longer take actions that would seriously escalate the situation, while on the one hand, its authorities are still actively carrying out their plan of aggression, even going so far as to create the so-called 'Manchukuo' and signing a protocol with that 'country,' violating the Nine-Power Treaty's provisions on respecting China's national rights and territorial integrity. What country is this? It is Japan. The Japanese representative denies these facts or distorts them. I cannot force the members of the Executive Yuan to believe that what I say is true and what the Japanese representative says is false, but we are fortunate to have the factual report of the investigation team, which has a detailed and faithful record of the past and present situation in the three northeastern provinces. After months of work, the investigation team sought the facts on the ground and after detailed discussion, was able to create this fair and detailed report. If we were to argue against the findings of the investigation team, then not only would the work of the investigation team be completely wasted, but our efforts to find a solution to this case would also be fruitless.

<p>Yan Xishan's Reasons for Advocating Resistance</p>
<p>Reply to the Student Union's Petition</p>
<p>Shanxi-Sui Commanders Also United in Resisting Aggression</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence. The fifth executive committee of the Shanxi Student Union resolved to go to the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters on the 9th to petition Yan Xishan and the Shanxi-Sui commanders to send troops to resist Japan immediately. On that day, all the staff of the union, totaling 36 people, formed a large team, with Ren Zhirong as the general captain and Zhang Bingjun and Sang Chenglie as the deputy captains. They set off at 10:00 AM and, upon arriving at the gate of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, were admitted by the guards. Yan personally received them. First, the petition representatives of the Student Union, Wu Sheng and Chen Hongbin, spoke one after another, saying, "We have come to see the director today to ask the director to send troops to resist Japan, to ask the director to implement resistance against the brutal Japanese, because resistance is a manifestation of the national spirit, and non-resistance is a betrayal of the national character. Moreover, the more we do not resist, the more fiercely Japan attacks us. It is better to resist and preserve the nation than to not resist and lose the country. We know that most of the nations that have been lost throughout history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, are nations that did not resist, and most of the countries that have survived are countries that resisted. This fact has become an immutable principle. Originally, the people's hope for the government was a complete one, but later, because the government gave away the eastern provinces, did not defend Jinzhou, did not support the 19th Route Army, and did not support the Northeast Volunteer Army, hope turned into disappointment. Today, Yuguan has fallen, and Tianjin and Tanggu are not secure. If the government wants to win back the people's hearts and seek survival, it can only resolve to resist, because resistance can turn the people's disappointment back into hope, otherwise, it will lead from disappointment to despair. Therefore, in addition to sending a telegram to the central government asking it to immediately issue a national general mobilization order to resist Japan with force, we also ask the Shanxi-Sui commanders to immediately send troops to resist Japan with force, to fight for the survival of the nation and to fight for the character of the country," and so on. After they finished speaking, Yan replied, saying, "What you have said is very true. Resistance is not dangerous, non-resistance is dangerous. The government's position on the fall of Yuguan is that it must resolve to resist. However, everyone must know that fighting requires preparation. Japan has been preparing for forty years, and emerging Western countries also have considerable preparations. We know that without preparation, we cannot declare war. As the saying goes, 'prepare for a rainy day,' which is the same principle. However, resistance is different from declaring war, and resistance is the duty of soldiers, especially the manifestation of the national spirit. Only by resisting can other countries sympathize, and only then can all nations rise up. When I was at the riverbank a few years ago, Japan attacked Jinzhou, and Mr. Wang telegraphed me to ask whether I advocated war or peace. I replied that I advocated neither war nor peace, but resistance. I advocated resistance for four reasons: ㈠ Japan is seeking its own death, ㈡ To test the attitude of the League of Nations, ㈢ We should not abandon the three northeastern provinces, ㈣ To show the spirit of the nation. When this telegram arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Wang expressed sympathy and invited me to propose a plan to the Central Committee for everyone to discuss. Unexpectedly, this caused many misunderstandings. Later, someone came to Shanxi and talked to me about this matter, and I still considered it a mistake not to defend Jinzhou. Today, those in charge declare war, but they are not prepared. If they do not fight, the people will not allow it. Soldiers must fight when they go to battle, and not fighting will be harmful, but resistance cannot be chaotic resistance, so there must be a plan. Director Zhang's resistance this time is truly determined, and Chairman Chiang also has the same intention. When the news of the fall of Yuguan came, I and the Shanxi-Sui commanders also telegraphed Zhang, expressing our willingness to jointly resist aggression. Chen Xingru and Yi Sheng and others also telegraphed Zhang, and the details are as reported in the newspapers. As for the matter of Shanxi-Sui sending troops, preparations have been made here, but it must be determined after the government's overall plan. If the central government's order arrives, the Shanxi army can set off immediately. This kind of righteousness is a duty, and sacrifice is not to be spared. However, how many troops to send and what steps to take are confidential and cannot be explained to you. This resistance</p>

<p>Yixing Xianqin Temple Blood Case: Forensic Institute's Appraisal Deemed Absurd. Clothes, Chopping Knife, etc., Found with No Traces of Blood. The Bones Were from Carnivorous Animals and Chickens. The Clothes, Pants, Socks, and Handkerchief Were Buried Recently.</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports: The Yixing Xianqin Temple blood case caused a stir and attracted social attention. The Yixing County Government sent evidence to the Academia Sinica, but it could not be identified. Therefore, on November 26th of the previous year, the Academia Sinica forwarded the evidence – a monk's robe, a towel, a sock, a chopping knife, a planing knife, and a bag of lime and bones – to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination and appraisal. After a month, the examination was completed on December 28th of last year. The appraisal indicated that the clothes, chopping knife, etc., had no human blood. The bones were from carnivorous animals and chickens. The rotten parts of the towel were artificially cut and twisted. The clothes, etc., had been buried recently. The rumored ghost stories were deemed absurd, resolving social doubts. The full text of the Forensic Institute's appraisal report is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Appraisal Report (Case Details Omitted)</h3>
<p>(A) General. Examination. "Physical Evidence." The submitted physical evidence was wrapped in white coarse cloth, labeled "Shanghai Zhenru Judicial Administration Department Forensic Institute for Receipt" and "Sent by Nanjing Academia Sinica," etc. Upon opening, there was another layer of white coarse cloth, labeled "Nanjing Academia Sinica Received," stamped with the Yixing County Government's seal, etc. After cutting open the cloth, it was heavily wrapped in newspapers, forming two small newspaper packages. The first small package was labeled "Security Department 4th Regiment 3rd Battalion Presented Xianqin Temple Case Skeletal Remains 11.8," etc. The second small package was labeled "Security Department 3rd Battalion Presented Xianqin Temple Case Blood-Stained Clothes Knife, etc. 11.8," etc. Further unwrapping each package, the first package contained a bag of skeletal remains as evidence. The second package contained a towel, a monk's collar robe, a white woven sock, a pair of torn pants, a chopping knife, a planing knife, and a small bag of wall plaster as evidence. For convenience in examining the evidence, the examined evidence was divided into eight items. The above evidence was originally sealed by the Yixing County Government and resealed by the Academia Sinica. The seals were intact. The examination room of this institute opened the packages for inspection. (A) Macroscopic and Animal Morphology Anatomical Examination. (Item 1) "Skeletal Remains" A bag of old, fragmented, decayed bones of varying sizes, totaling 306 centimeters. The shaped ones were first compared and examined in detail according to morphological anatomy. (1) The evidentiary skeletal remains were a piece of vertebra, 1.6 cm long and 6 cm wide. The lateral processes were very long, large, flat, and wing-like, shaped like a butterfly. The surface was relatively rough, and there were no vertebral bodies or left and right articular surfaces visible. The vertebral foramen was shaped like a regular single. This is completely different from human vertebrae. A human vertebra was specifically taken for comparison and photography to provide further evidence. The lateral processes of human vertebrae should not be flat, and there should be no vertebral body (except for the first cervical vertebra, which has no vertebral body but still has left and right articular surfaces) and left and right articular surfaces. The vertebral foramen should also not be round. Therefore, the evidentiary vertebrae were actually the same as animal bones, especially similar to carnivorous animals such as dogs (photo 1 attached). (2) The evidentiary skeletal remains were bow-shaped and flat, actually ribs, but their curvature and size differed greatly from human ribs. Therefore, they must not be human bones but animal ribs (photo 1 attached). (3) The evidentiary skeletal remains had seven dental socket-like small holes and were actually a piece of mandible. Its angle was very straight, not curved, and its diameter had reached 4.5 cm, and it was not curved. In the human mandible, at 4.5 cm, it should have formed a curve. Also, the tooth holes of the evidence were smaller than human tooth holes. There was also a fragmented front end of the mandible, with the base angle shaped like a single, and attached to it were three teeth with yellow pigment deposition on the roots. The tips were extremely sharp and curved in a short arc. Human and ruminant animals (herbivores) tooth holes and bones do not have this phenomenon. Therefore, it is known that the evidence was also the bone and teeth of a carnivorous animal (photo 1 attached). (4) The evidentiary teeth, including the teeth on the front mandible, totaled eight, of which five were molars, larger than human molars. The upper and lower ends each had three cusps. In humans, the upper surface of molars should be flat and slightly concave in the center, and there should be no pointed shape. The two incisors and one canine tooth were all sharp and round, smaller than human teeth. They were completely different from human canine and incisor teeth and were actually the teeth of carnivorous animals, especially similar to dog teeth (photo 1 attached). (5) The evidentiary skeletal remains were two pieces of ulna. Observing the front and back, they were like the left and right ulna, but they were broken. One of the olecranon processes was still clear. The olecranon process matched with the human ulna, not only was the size vastly different, but also the ends of the evidentiary ulna were also narrower. The radial notch and ulnar tuberosity were not very obvious. The back was shaped like a narrow single, only 0.8 cm wide. The back of the human ulna was shaped like a half single, about 2 cm wide. In short, their morphology and structure were different from human bones (photo 2 attached). (6) The evidentiary skeletal remains were the right hip bone, 9 cm long and 2 cm wide, with a rough surface. The shape of its upper edge was narrow and long. The upper edge of the human hip bone was elliptical and did not have this shape. The hip bone of animals was narrow and long. Therefore, upon examination of this kind of hip bone, it was known that it was animal bone, and its size was also different from an adult skull (photo 2 attached). (7) The evidentiary skeletal remains were the tibia. The medial malleolus and lateral malleolus of its upper end had disappeared. Only the medial malleolus of the lower end existed. The evidence was 14.5 cm long, with yellow soil on the surface, and the upper end of the front edge of the bone was still fairly clear. The calcaneus and talus had been found and could be joined opposite the tibia. Their state was different from the human talus, and there were three tali. The comparison of their sizes differed from humans by one-fifth. If they were determined to be from a child, then ossification should not have been completed. Therefore, they must not be human bones and were actually animal bones (photo 3 attached). (8) The evidentiary skeletal remains were tubular. Its transverse diameter was larger. It should be the femur. Its upper end had disappeared, and the lower end was damaged. However, the bone was thin, and the transverse diameter was several times smaller than human bones. However, ossification had been completed. It must not be human bone and was actually the leg bone of an animal (photo 2 attached). (9) The evidentiary skeletal remains were similar to the lower end of the femur. Upon examination, its medial malleolus and intermalleolar corresponded to the femoral knee joint end. Its shape was also smaller than the human femoral knee joint. Its back was grooved. In human bone, the edge of the grooved part was a quadrangle with unequal sides. Therefore, the bone must not be human bone (photo 2 attached). (10) The evidentiary skeletal remains were tubular. The lower end had medial malleolus, lateral malleolus, and intermalleolar. The surface was smooth, and the bone quality was dense. However, it was thin, and the medullary cavity was larger. Therefore, it was similar to the bones of birds and animals. Chicken bones were taken for comparison and examination. The state, size, and transverse diameter of the left humerus of the chicken were quite similar. Therefore, it should be the right humerus of the chicken (photo 3 attached). (11) The evidentiary skeletal remains were shaped like small tubes. Both ends of the bone had articular surfaces. Their length was 2 cm, and the surface was dense. Humans do not have this kind of small bone. The phalanges of a chicken were taken for comparison. Their length and end, the shape of the articular surface, and the fineness of the bone were the same. Therefore, it is known that the small tubular bones were the phalanges of a chicken. (Item 2) "Robe" A collar robe for partial monks, light gray, the two sleeves were cut off, the front and back halves survived, the cloth had many holes and patched repairs, and there were blue/purple stains on the inside and outside of the collar, with yellow stains on the lower edge. The edge of the hole was neat and the rope hadn't rotted, the breakage hadn't been the result of animal bites or rats. There wasn't much dirt on the surface, no mold or dirt, or visible grey stains - caused by washing/fading. The cloth was hard to tear and would not easily rip. The fabric had not been in the ground for long, as acid and damp would eat away at the fabric; stains were left to be tested for chemicals and using microscopes under UV lights (see report). (Item 3) "Pants" Consisted of dark grey and light grey fabric stitched together, with a length of 107 cm and a waist width of 52 cm, equivalent to that of an adult, with 5 stitch marks and stains, with bright blue seems on the stitch marks. Not easily ripped, had not been worn much, indicating it hadn't rotted in the earth for long. Stains from these pants would undergo chemical, microscopic and UV analyses. (see report). (Item 4) "Socks" Made of light grey cloth with a long cuff of 36 cm, indicating that it was a monk's sock. The sock's base was destroyed and only a small edge remained with yellow/brown stains. The cuffs had 12 uneven square shaped holes with neat edges that seemed to have been made intentionally, and could not have been from rot, animal bites or accidental tears, meaning they hadn't been in the ground for too long. All stains would undergo chemical, microscopic and UV analyses. (see report). (Item 5) "Towel" A gray colored towel that was 61 cm long and 33 cm wide with a blue 'Chang Jing' (常凈) embroidered on one end, indicating it had been washed regularly and the color had faded. Had 25 uneven tears with rounded and square holes, where some tears occurred due to abrasion - with cloth threads deteriorating and thinning out, while others were neat tears that seemed to be have been intentional. Hadn't been in the ground for too long with many purple/red stains around the holes, where the cloth was cut off to remove. All stains would be analyzed with chemicals, microscopy, UV lights and human blood testing. (see report). (Photo 4 included). (Item 6) "Chopping Knife" A chopping knife with no wooden handle and a length of 18.5 cm, with a thin iron handle of 9 cm. The whole thing was covered in rust and a lot of dirt. On one side there were two nicks and a yellow stain when examined under magnification, which would undergo chemical, microscopic and UV analyses, as well as human blood testing (see report). The shape and the rust indicate that it had been abandoned and buried for a while. If the pants and other items had been buried at the same time, the material would also be rotten and fall apart, indicating that these items were not buried together, or at least one or two years apart. However, the bone and the knife might be from the same period, as the bones have lost their fat and are starting to rot. Chicken bones appear to be fresher, with empty marrow, missing muscle and with shiny bones, which also suggests that it was more recent (Photo 5 included). (Item 7) "Plane Knife" With no wooden handle and only a ring-shaped iron sheath that was 14cm long and 3.8cm wide, with a small hole on the end, attached with a lot of rust like the chopping knife, indicating that it was left there for a while. Would undergo chemical, microscopic and UV analyses (see report). (Photo 5 included). (Item 8) "Wall Plaster" Wrapped in a yellow paper with broken pieces of light grey, stained with brown, with all stains to be tested with chemicals, microscopy, UV lights and human blood testing (see report). (B) Microscopic and Chemical Examination. (C) Ultraviolet Light Analysis. (D) Anti-Human Blood Serum Precipitation Reaction Test. (Hua Dong News Agency reporter note) The three kinds of examination methods above are omitted due to length.)</p>
<h3>Appraisal</h3>
<p>(1) The letter inquired whether the clothes, chopping knife, planing knife, and lime (wall plaster) were stained with human blood. Based on the previous macroscopic examination, chemical and microscopic examination, ultraviolet light analysis, and blood serum test, as well as the results of items 3 to 7, it was determined that the evidence was not stained with blood and contained no human blood. (2) The letter inquired whether the skeletal remains were complete human bones or a mixture. Based on the examination, (A) comparative anatomy of human and animal morphology, (B) microscopic examination of bone tissue structure, and the results of items 1 and 2, it was determined that the bones were definitely not human bones. Most of them were bones of carnivorous animals, especially similar to dog bones. A small part were chicken bones and were not complete (the specific animal could not be determined because the bones were not complete), and they were a mixture. (3) The letter inquired how many years the items had been buried. Based on the examination, (A) items 1 to 7 and explanation, (5) result, it was determined that the clothes, pants, socks, towel, and chicken bones were buried recently, while the knife and animal bones had rotted, and their abandonment time exceeded one or two years. The above appraisal is true and accurate. Appraised by Lin Ji.</p>
<h3>First Sub-Prison Warden Reported Inflated Prisoner Food Prices, Involved in Embezzlement</h3>
<p>The sub-prison warden, along with the logistics officer and rice shop owner, were accused. The former warden was also found to have major suspicions of rice and grain embezzlement. Yesterday's interrogation resulted in each person being released on bail pending sentencing.</p>
<p>Lu Shaoxun, a Guangxi Guilin native and sub-prison warden of the Jiangsu Second Prison Sub-Prison, colluded with Xia Hepu, a Nanjing native and logistics officer, to inflate prisoner food prices. The Second Higher Court's President Shen discovered this and ordered the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office to investigate Lu and Xia, as well as Gui Rongchun, the Shanghai owner of the Xietai Rice Shop at 434 Qipu Road. After the investigation concluded, a public prosecution was filed with the corresponding criminal court. The indictment is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Indictment</h3>
<p>The accused Lu Shaoxun is the sub-prison warden of the Jiangsu Second Prison Sub-Prison. When he took office on November 11th of this year (the 21st year), he brought Xia Hepu to serve as the director of wardens and handle logistics. The two accused, prior to taking office, claimed that the 42 shi of rice handed over by former sub-prison warden Huang Pei were underweight and should be compensated. They demanded a subsidy of 20 yuan, embezzling it for personal gain. The accused also sought to benefit themselves by colluding with Gui Rongchun, the owner of Xietai Rice Shop, and Li Yufang, the shop's accountant and runner. They instructed the shop to falsely issue an invoice for 5 shi of rice sold on November 18th, stating the price as 10 yuan and 2 jiao per shi, as proof of purchasing 5 shi of rice from the shop on that day for future reimbursement. At that time, the Second Higher Court's president, noting that the rice price purchased by Lu Shaoxun differed greatly from the market price, repeatedly ordered a strict reduction. Lu Shaoxun and Xia Hepu still sought to benefit themselves. On November 27th, they purchased 10 shi of Gaoji Jian rice from Xietai, agreeing on a price of 8 yuan and 1 jiao per shi, but colluded with Gui Rongchun and others to falsely inflate the invoice to 10 yuan and 2 jiao per shi. On the 3rd of this month, Lu again ordered Xia Hepu to order 50 shi of Jiji Jian rice from Xietai, agreeing on a price of 8 yuan and 2 jiao per shi, which was delivered in installments. They still colluded with Gui Rongchun and others to falsely inflate the invoice to 9 yuan and 8 jiao per shi and submitted it on file on the 20th of this month. The Second Higher Court's president, noting that the rice price reported by the accused was still much higher than the market price, ordered Clerk Dai Hongji to take a sample of the prison's rice to various rice shops on the 21st of this month to ascertain the actual market price of the rice. The market price on that day was only 8 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao, which was reported truthfully on file. The Second Higher Court's president, noting that the prison's purchase of prisoner food was quite inaccurate and incomplete, sent a letter to the Second Higher Court's Chief Prosecutor, ordering an investigation. The prosecutor went to the Xietai Rice Shop to search for wholesale ledgers related to the case. Gui Rongchun and others, realizing that the matter had been discovered, claimed to be searching for the ledgers but immediately changed the rice price paid by the prison on the 3rd, 4th, 13th, 15th, and 17th of this month from 8 yuan and 2 jiao to 10 yuan and 2 jiao. The remaining accounts, due to the sudden rush, were not fully changed and the ledgers were handed over. Later, two more ledgers were submitted. At that time, it was found that the ink on the changed sections was not completely dry, and the old prices were faintly discernible. The unchanged sections did not match the prices paid on the invoices and in the prison's ledgers. It was suspected that the shop owner Gui Rongchun, the accountant and runner Li Yufang, and Lu Shaoxun were colluding in embezzlement. Gui was immediately arrested, while Li fled and has not been apprehended. Interrogations of Lu Shaoxun and Xia Hepu yielded evasive testimonies. Gui Rongchun admitted that the final 50 shi sold were priced at 8 yuan and 2 jiao per shi, but otherwise refused to tell the truth. It was found that when Lu Shaoxun replaced Huang Pei, he claimed that the transferred prisoner rice was underweight and demanded a subsidy of 20 yuan from Huang, which the accused had confessed to during interrogation by Chief Prosecutor Wang of this court. There is no doubt that the accused received this 20 yuan but did not deposit it into the prison's public funds, making it clear that he embezzled it for personal gain. As for the 5 shi of Gaoji Jian rice reported to have been purchased on November 18th, no such transaction was found in Xietai's ledgers. Furthermore, when Lu Shaoxun took office on November 11th of this year, former sub-prison warden Huang Pei transferred 42 shi of food rice. According to his report to the Second Higher Court on the 12th of this month, the transferred rice was eaten until the end of November. Based on the accused's claim that 3 shi of rice were eaten per day, the transferred rice should have lasted at least 14 days, until November 24th. Therefore, there was clearly no need to purchase rice on November 18th. Combined with the fact that Xietai had no record of this transaction, the purchase of rice was purely a collusion between Lu and Xia to have the rice shop falsely issue an invoice for the purpose of embezzling and splitting the profits, which can be definitively determined. As for the 10 shi of food rice purchased on November 27th, Xietai's ledgers stated the price as 8 yuan and 1 jiao per shi. The subsequent purchase of 50 shi was confessed by Gui Rongchun to be priced at 8 yuan and 2 jiao per shi. Therefore, the rice prices on the shop's invoices were purely false and do not require further elaboration. Combined with the fact that Gui Rongchun and others temporarily changed the prices on the ledgers during the search, the collusion and embezzlement of the accused can be clearly understood. Lu Shaoxun claimed that he was unfamiliar with the situation in Shanghai and that Xia Hepu was solely responsible for purchasing prisoner food, and that he did not inquire about it. However, the warden's family lived in Shanghai. How could he not compare the quality and price of the rice eaten by his family with the quality and price of the prison's rice? In November and December of this year, the highest price for the so-called Shanghai rice was only 9 yuan per shi, but the price of prisoner rice was inflated to 10 yuan and 2 jiao. How can he claim to have been deceived by others? Furthermore, he repeatedly received strict orders from the Second Higher Court's president to conduct a thorough reduction. How could he not have investigated at all? It is clear that he colluded with Xia Hepu in embezzlement. Given this clear evidence of guilt, it is not appropriate to allow him to lightly evade criminal responsibility by claiming that his subordinate engaged in embezzlement and that he was negligent in supervision. The accused Gui Rongchun, as the owner of Xietai Rice Shop, falsely inflated the invoice for the last 50 shi of rice sold to the Second Sub-Prison, as the accused Lu and Xia used it for reimbursement and embezzlement. Furthermore, when the ledgers were searched on that day, the accused and Li Yufang insisted that the rice price most recently sold to the sub-prison was indeed 10 yuan and 2 jiao and temporarily altered the prices. It is extremely clear that they knowingly assisted Lu Shaoxun and others in embezzlement with the shop's accountant Li Yufang. Based on the above reasoning, the accused Lu Shaoxun and Xia Hepu are each consecutively guilty of Article 136 of the Criminal Code in accordance with Article 42 of the Criminal Code. The accused Gui Rongchun is also guilty of the same crime in accordance with Article 45, Paragraph 1 and Article 44, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Furthermore, a review of Xietai Rice Shop's ledgers revealed that former sub-prison warden Huang Pei and director of wardens Chen Naochi also had major suspicions of violating Article 136 of the Criminal Code. They have already fled upon hearing the news and warrants have been issued for their arrest. In addition to separately issuing warrants to arrest and continue investigating the fugitives Huang Pei, Chen Naochi, and Li Yufang, this indictment is filed in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Respectfully submitted to this court's criminal court by Prosecutor Zhong Qing.</p>
<h3>Interrogation Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Criminal Court President Qian Hongye, accompanied by Clerk Guan Zhiliang, presided over the interrogation in Criminal Court No. 1. Lu Shaoxun hired lawyers Zhang Xiaozeng and Shen Junru. Gui Rongchun hired lawyer Zhu Xiyun for defense. First, Prosecutor Zhong stated the reasons for the indictment. Lu Shaoxun testified that he had been a clerk in the Ministry of Justice. He was new to Shanghai, so he was unfamiliar with local customs. The purchase of prisoner food was handled entirely by Xia Hepu, and he was completely unaware of it, etc. Xia Hepu testified that he only paid based on Xietai's invoices and denied any embezzlement. Gui Rongchun testified that he was illiterate and all accounts and transactions were managed by Li Yufang, so he was unaware of the alteration of accounts. After President Qian repeatedly questioned each of the accused, he ordered the debate to begin. After Prosecutor Zhong and the accused's lawyers debated, President Qian announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 19th. Lu Shaoxun was allowed to post 1,000 yuan bail, and Gui Rongchun was allowed to post 400 yuan original bail and leave to await sentencing.</p>

<p>Hua Wu Steamship Crushes Eleven Dock Boats. The Ebb Tide Was Too Strong for the Hua Wu Steamship to Control. Eleven dock boats were crushed one after another.</p>
<p>The Hua Wu steamship of the Nan Wu Steamship Company at 60 Ningbo Road, Public Concession, broke loose and went out to the port, crushing 11 dock boats and hurting one worker. A worker from the maritime customs police department investigated the situation and found the following events took place:</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Incident</h3>
<p>Yi Tai Xin coal yard is located on the left and right sides of the Dong Jia Du Pier, Pu Dong. It is divided into two: The north and south yards. It has a concrete pier in the middle, with three yards separated by only a short distance. The Hua Wu steamship was docked in the south yard, with the ship facing north and tail south. At 5:30 in the morning, the ship set sail for the port, due to the massive size of the ship, the ship hired a dragline from the Hui De Feng Dragline Company. The ship body was dragged open. The crew knew at the time that the tides were rapidly ebbing, causing the ship to go north and knock over 4 boats from the south yard, 4 from the middle yard and 3 from the north yard, where the boats were crushed.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Damage</h3>
<p>Hua Wu ship first crushed the four boats berthed at the south yard. From inside to outside, Boat No. 8340, owned by Zhu A Hu and foreman Yao Zhang Fu, had its hull crushed and rails broken. The foreman reported to the maritime customs police department 300 yuan in damages. Boat No. 27204, owned by Zhu Jin Ji and foreman Qin San Zi, had its hull, rails and rear water gate broken, reporting 200 yuan in damages. Boat No. 24984, owned by He Zhu Sheng and foreman Shen Jin Kui, had its hull completely destroyed, reporting 1,200 yuan in damages. Boat No. 5762, owned by Xu A He and foreman Xu Ting Ru (his father, who was crushed to death), was completely crushed, reporting 500 yuan in damages. The ship continued floating north, and crushed 4 ships from the middle yard. The first, second, and third boats had not yet reported damages. The fourth boat, owned by Xu A Gen and foreman Wei Hong Yu, had its hull completely destroyed, reporting 1,200 yuan in damages. Although the engine was working intensely, it was still out of control, and crushed 3 boats from the north yard. The first boat had not yet reported damages. Boat No. 13493, owned by Zhou You Lan and foreman Lu Qi Lan, had its center of the hull completely destroyed, reporting 1,000 yuan in damages. Boat No. 32440, owned by Zhu Yi Cai and foreman Wu Cai Ming, had its hull completely destroyed and filled with water, reporting 2,000 yuan in damages.</p>
<h3>One Foreman Dies</h3>
<p>The boat owned by Xu A He, docked on the outermost part of the south yard of the Yi Tai Xin (boat No. 4) was hit head on. After being crushed, the ropes broke and the hull floated along with the tide to the outside of the Bei Shou Ri Lun ship. At the same time, the Hua Wu ship was still advancing, so Xu's boat was in between two giant ships. The tail of the Hua Wu crushed Xu's ship. Foreman Xu Ting Ru did not escape and was badly injured and fell into the port. He floated along the tide to the Osaka Wharf near the Yang Jia Du, where a patrol boat finally spotted him and brought him up. He was already dead and was brought to the police station. The court brought Coroner Xi to examine the body and determined that his arms were broken, his throat was crushed, he had a giant hole in his chest and many bones were broken. The coroner said it was the cause of his injuries. His son, Boat Owner Xu A He, got the coffin and prepared the funeral. He was from Jiang Bei and was 54 years old.</p>
<p>Flower Cloth Boat Robbed in the Suzhou River in West Shanghai. Losses Amount to 15,000 to 16,000 Yuan. One Volunteer Police Officer Even Went Missing.</p>
<p>Yesterday (14th) at 1:10 AM, a large barge filled with flower cloth, moored in the Suzhou River at Fan Huang Ferry on Jisi Fei'er Road in West Shanghai, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen robbers in a large-scale robbery. A large batch of over seventy foreign parcels of flower cloth were robbed, with a value of approximately 15,000 to 16,000 yuan. The volunteer police officer escorting the boat was dragged away by the robbers and has gone missing. The details of the robbery are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Snow Flew and Goods Were Not Unloaded</h3>
<p>On the 12th, Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese company, hired a large barge, Boat No. 8053, owned by boat owner Ding Guan Tong. From Hong Sheng Pier in Pu Dong, it transported a large cargo of 110 foreign parcels (each foreign parcel being a large package, each package weighing 400 catties). It was transported to the Suzhou River in front of the Toyoda Spinning Mill on the east side of the Zhongshan Road Bridge in West Shanghai and moored. The company sent a volunteer police officer, Li Xiao Lian, to escort the boat. At approximately 4:00 PM, 30 packages were unloaded and carried into the Toyoda Mill. The remaining packages were scheduled to be transported the next day, as it was already late. However, on the 13th (the day before yesterday), heavy snow fell all day, and the boat deck was icy and slippery, preventing unloading.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Robbery</h3>
<p>In addition to the boat owner and two volunteer police officers, there were also three boat crew members: Chen Jin Kui, Jiang Gen Sheng, and Xu Yang Sheng, totaling five people. They were all sound asleep. Just as the first hour of the morning struck, more than a dozen robbers suddenly rushed onto the boat and dragged everyone out of their blankets. Four of the robbers brandished pistols to intimidate and prevent anyone from making noise. They then dragged the boat owner and the four crew members to the stern and tied them up with ropes. Next, they dragged the volunteer police officer, Li Xiao Lian, ashore and left. Then, they sailed the boat near the barracks and unloaded the flower cloth onto the shore, totaling 72 parcels, which were loaded onto trucks. Approximately two hours were spent on the robbery, with losses estimated at around 15,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Police Officer Missing</h3>
<p>The boat owner and the four crew members were all tied up and pushed into the stern, so they did not witness the robbery of the flower cloth. They only untied each other and came out after the robbers left, when it was nearly 5:00 AM and dawn was breaking. However, volunteer police officer Li Xiao Lian, who did not carry a pistol, was dragged ashore by the robbers and did not resist. The crew members searched ashore, but there was no trace of him. His clothing, hat, and shoes were all left on the boat. As of yesterday afternoon, he was still missing.</p>
<h3>Pursuit in Heavy Snow</h3>
<p>Boat owner Ding Guan Tong reported the incident to the Sixth District Police Station, which had jurisdiction. Chief Tan received the report and immediately dispatched Inspector Shao to lead the entire platoon of officers to the scene in the heavy snow. However, the robbers had already fled far away. The police immediately searched in all directions, but there was still no trace by dawn. They then questioned vegetable farmers, who reported that the robbers used six trucks to transport the goods away. District Commissioner Jiang interrogated the boat owner and crew members, who testified as above. Neighboring boatmen, such as Zhang Fu Jiang and two others, were also brought in for questioning. Chief Tan then ordered his subordinates and the West Shanghai Detective Team to strictly investigate the stolen goods and apprehend the robbers.</p>
<p>Xianshi Amusement Park Female Performer Attempts Suicide. Scolded by Mother for Not Returning Home Overnight. Daughter Retorted, Taking Poison to End Life.</p>
<p>Luo A Yu, a 14-year-old girl from Shaoxing, lived at 133 Shan Jia Garden, Baike Road. Due to difficult living conditions, she was taught to sing at a young age and recently worked as a female performer at Xianshi Amusement Park to earn a living. However, the night before last, A Yu did not return home all night. It was not until yesterday morning that she staggered home. Her mother scolded her, but A Yu retorted. As a result, a major conflict erupted between mother and daughter. At noon, A Yu went out again on her own. Before long, she returned and went to bed. Her mother did not pay much attention to it. About an hour later, her mother suddenly heard A Yu moaning. She quickly went inside to check and saw that her face was pale and her breathing was rapid. Knowing that something was wrong, she quickly hired a car to take her to Baolong Hospital. After examination by the hospital doctor, it was discovered that she had taken a large amount of poison. She was given emergency treatment, but her condition remained critical.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Plans to Build Affordable Housing.</p>
<p>The charity horse race lottery held by the city to relieve the poor in Zhabei has been enthusiastically promoted by all parties, who are grateful for the righteous act, so the results have been very good. The Finance Bureau has already transferred the ticket price of 865,000 yuan to the Shanghai Race Club, which it received in installments from the Race Club for the prize tickets. However, since it is now cold winter, the municipal government believes that the general public needs a place to protect them from the cold to provide relief. Therefore, it first used the city bank to allocate funds to fill the gap and expedite the construction of affordable housing in the Jiangwan area. At the same time, it has formally sent a letter to the Race Club, requesting it to allocate 250,000 yuan before the race is held to facilitate relief operations.</p>

<p>Qianzhuang Decide on the Final Closing Date. January 25th.</p>
<p>The large and small qianzhuang in the northern and southern cities of this port, from Huijia downwards, have gone through two years since the government explicitly promulgated the National Calendar New Year's closing regulations. However, due to long-standing habits, it was not easy to change suddenly. Therefore, every year they had to find excuses to change the date. This year, on the surface, there was no opportunity to make excuses, so they had no choice but to wait and see. Now that the abolition of the lunar New Year is approaching, they can no</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Violet An Anecdotes   Skinny Crane</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Chu Cang was originally from Wangping Street. Since the success of the revolution, he became a central committee member, and I haven't seen him for many years. Even his good novels with tragic and passionate themes like "Mengbian Mingzhu Ji" and "Gushu Han Jia Ji" can no longer be seen. This is truly a great loss to the literary world. I remember when I was on a trip to see him when he was solely responsible for the chief editor of the Republican Daily, I saw him barefoot, wearing slippers, dressed in short clothes, drinking wine and eating peanuts while writing articles. He was unconventional and unrestrained, completely in the style of a famous scholar. I wonder if his attitude has changed in the years he has been an official. Not only does Mr. Ye write good novels, but he is also an expert at composing poetry and filling in lyrics. After the new cultural tide swept the country, he occasionally got excited and played around with new punctuation marks and wrote new-style poems, showing his talent on the new literary scene. After all, he had a good foundation in old literature, so his new-style poems were also extraordinary. I especially love his three "What I Saw on the Way Back to Zhouzhuang":</p>
<p>(1) The wind comes from the bow of the boat, the foot of the sail turns, the lower the sail, the rope is pulled, each goes ashore, the trackers pull the boat like pulling a cart, it is ridiculous for the people on the boat, why don't they go ashore?</p>
<p>(2) Breaking the mud dam, mud clothes, mud skirt, mud shoes and socks, hair not combed, whose girl is this? Taking advantage of the early morning when no one is around, singing a village song: "Lang ah!"</p>
<p>(3) The river water flows south like an arrow, the river bank connects like a line, fog is not fog, smoke is not smoke. Where does the human voice come from at night, making people change their mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's surname is Ye, and his given name is also "Ye". His pen name is Xiao Feng, which is so fragrant and beautiful, and is inversely proportional to his tall and extraordinary figure. Zhouzhuang belongs to Wujiang County and is his hometown.</p>
<p>Each Has Its Own Place   Xianxian</p>
<p>| Well Water Does Not Invade River Water |</p>
<p>Speaking of drama, a very complex image suddenly appeared in my mind. Peking opera, with its rhythmic beats, is indeed popular, and civilized drama, which relies on spoken language, is also supported by the masses. Cantonese opera, with its "Lang ya, Qing ya," sells out every day, and in the Yangzhou opera theaters, with their "Little Sister Long, Little Sister Short," why aren't they crowded every day? The audience of the Siming opera, with its "Ah Ge, Ah Ge," often laughs, and in the Shaoxing opera theaters, with their "Wu ya, Wu ya," the applause is equally endless. Everyone has their own hobbies, and you can't force people to watch plays they don't like, nor can you attract customers who don't like a certain type of play to a certain venue. This is an irrefutable law.</p>
<p>Everything in society is like this. Let me give you another example. Take religion, for instance. Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism each have their own believers, their own places to hold religious ceremonies, and their own spirits. It is absolutely impossible to force a Muslim to be baptized as a Christian, and at the same time, Buddhism has no possibility of absorbing Catholics.</p>
<p>Taking the press as an example, each newspaper has its own spirit, its own strengths, and its own readers. It is impossible to force the readers of this newspaper to read another newspaper, and it is equally impossible for another newspaper to absorb the readers of this newspaper. To narrow it down further, each supplement of this newspaper has its own place. Just like a city with various religious chapels, this supplement naturally has its own believers.</p>
<p>"Each has its own place, and well water does not invade river water." This is a newly discovered law that can be applied to any society. I am confident that the discovery of this law is no less important than Newton's discovery of gravity.</p>
<p>Planning for Children   Da Shuan</p>
<p>| Present Hardship for Future Happiness |</p>
<p>I have two little angels, a girl of seven and a boy of five. Like a horse or a slave, I feel that the little minds of these two little monsters are full of innocence, joy, intelligence, and cleverness, especially their fair skin, black hair, clear eyes, and rosy cheeks, like newly opened fresh flowers and luminous pearls, truly, really cute. But maybe I'm just too biased (a leper's son praises himself), but at least more than half of it is true. I am a middle-aged man, born in this unfortunate environment, naturally more sorrow than joy, truly "nothing accomplished, hair turning gray"! Moreover, in this day and age, opening my eyes and looking around, everything stimulates my nerves, causing extreme sadness, pain, and bitterness. But I am not someone with authority, so even with extreme sadness, anger, sorrow, and frustration, I dare not make a sound, fearing to attract unforeseen consequences. I can only stuff these nameless grievances into my chest, which feels like it will burst. Therefore, sometimes, when I feel so depressed that I'm about to die, these two little things, little monsters, come to my side and call out loudly, "Dad, we'll put on a show for you, don't be unhappy." Before they finish speaking, they open their little mouths and sing a tune without a melody, and their little faces make some irregular expressions, one blowing and one singing, one matching and one blocking, putting on a serious performance. Sometimes, these two little elves act out some playful games to tease and amuse me, dispelling my silent worries. Truly, these two little monsters are my little treasures for relieving sorrow and my little animals for turning tears into smiles. They are so cute, but these two little angels have come to the home of someone like me, who cannot live without working for a day. The future is vast, where is the hope? Isn't that too pitiful? Therefore, I have to tighten my already tight budget within my hundred-dollar salary, deducting five dollars each month and saving it in the bank as an education fund for the little ones in the future. Teachers who are as poor as I am and have children, sympathize with me.</p>

<p>Novel Pain   ·Le·Hong·Skinny Crane</p>
<p>At that time, he stared at the faces of the couple for a few seconds, and suddenly felt that in his life, apart from his own parents when he was a child, he had never seen faces that were gentler than theirs. Especially at this moment, they were several times more amiable than when they met in the past. He felt that being close to the fire in the stove could eliminate the cold air on his body, and being close to their faces could directly eliminate the severe cold in his heart, directly making his withered and cramped heart instantly sprout with infinite vitality. He thought wildly like this, and then thought of his stepmother, whose harsh expression often carried a meaning that seemed to be mocking, sarcastic, ridiculing, or ironic. As soon as it flashed before his eyes, it caused prickling sensations in his blood. While thinking wildly, he looked at the Dongfang Sheng couple again, and he almost couldn't believe that in the same world, there could be these two absolutely different faces.</p>
<p>So he couldn't help but let out a long sigh, as if a person carrying a thousand pounds and walking a hundred miles had temporarily rested, and both his body and mind felt incomparably light and comfortable, thinking that he could temporarily escape from that kind of terrible gaze.</p>
<p>The Dongfang Sheng couple were very familiar with his family situation. They clearly knew that the events of this night were another tragedy brewing under the dark forces of his family. However, they seemed to have made a prior agreement not to mention a single word about these things. They saw him deep in thought for a while, and then letting out a long sigh, knowing that his spirit still retained the trauma, so they began to use a humorous tone, one word from you and one word from me, trying their best to amuse him, just like adults coaxing crying children, trying to drive away his unhappiness.</p>
<p>Dongfang Sheng was usually a dignified and resolute young man, who was not good at making jokes, but at this moment, he deliberately made a funny appearance, and playfully said to him: "Your muscles and bones have been trained very well recently, you can very well become a brother to a polar bear of the Arctic Ocean. In such cold weather, you have the interest to come out and find Northwest to drink, : : : but : you you : however : : :"</p>
<p>Just like a beard-type character transformed into a clown, he was not good at being humorous after all. As soon as Dongfang Sheng said these few sentences, he suddenly felt that his words were not only not funny, but might even arouse his sorrow. So he immediately stopped and tried to think of some fresh and interesting jokes to tell, but after all, he couldn't find any, so he stammered and turned into a mouthful of "however" and "but".

<p>Women's Paradise Fundamental Beauty Solution   Juan Yun</p>
<p>The gardener said to us, "If you want to cultivate beautiful flowers, you must first protect the roots of the flowers." Everyone knows this.</p>
<p>Naturally, the flower has such beautiful colors, not just by modifying the leaves and petals, but it must be gradually grown through protection and irrigation at the root to develop into a lovely flower.</p>
<p>The beauty of our people is also like this. If our complexion and skin are not good-looking, it won't have any effect no matter how much powder and rouge we apply. Why is this? Have you ever tried to find the root cause? Nine out of ten women will just apply a little powder when their face doesn't look good, or even just some snow cream. Very few people are willing to study the fundamental solution to beauty problems.</p>
<p>The most common problem that hinders our beauty is constipation. Constipation is extremely harmful to a person's life. Sometimes, it can cause a sallow and thin complexion, or the skin has no color, or the spirit is tired, and many freckles and pimples appear. Sometimes, the eyes are dull, or the skin lacks vitality, or many useless fats are produced.</p>
<p>In addition to this, some people don't feel any pain, just that their face color isn't good. Some people take a lot of medicine to regulate their body, and even often take laxatives. These are all useless for beauty, and can even damage it.</p>
<p>Now, there is only one way, which is to change all lazy habits and practice the following four body exercises. If you can try it, you will definitely get very satisfactory results.</p>
<p>1. Stand with your legs apart, put your hands on your waist, bend your body forward as if bowing, and then slowly rotate your body left and right in a circular motion, six times to the left and six times to the right.</p>
<p>2. Stand up straight, put your legs together first, put your hands on your waist, and then bend your right leg at the knee and lift it up, as high as you can lift it. Then lean your body slightly forward and slowly lower your leg to the ground, first the right leg and then the left leg, practice 20 times each.</p>
<p>3. Stand up straight, separate your legs, put your hands on your waist, straighten your legs, and then bend your waist left and right to the point where you can't bend any further, practice about 12 times.</p>
<p>4. The last exercise is the most important. Open all the doors and windows to allow fresh air to circulate. Lie down on a flat couch, or even a clean floor, with your back against the floor, press your hands firmly on your stomach, breathe deeply, and slowly exhale.</p>
<p>Practice this every day without interruption. If you sometimes suffer from constipation, just drink some strong tea or a mild medicinal oil, and it will be effective. Therefore, to maintain beauty, you cannot have diarrhea.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate or doubt, practice every day according to what I said, and it won't be difficult for you to have a face as delicate as a flower.</p>

<p>Free Talk Ten Years Later (3)   Mo Ji</p>
<p>"Girl, a slave's life is inherently worthless! Being destroyed, tormented, and eroded by society and the world is only natural! I admit it. I am a slave - working without getting paid, I am a slave; being insulted, I am a slave; using our surplus value to support the rulers and oppressors, I am a slave! Slave, slave, being a slave everywhere! When will I stop being a slave? How can I throw off the stone on my shoulders? I have pondered this question for a long, long time, but I still can't answer it. Am I not usually proud of being striving, energetic, and stubborn? But where in society and the environment is there an opportunity for your will and strength to expand freely? Take you, girl, you are an incomplete person. You didn't sympathize with a slave standing in front of you, helping him to the end, and then you abandoned him. You know, you once used the kind, gentle, and loyal passion of a girl to drag a slave forward to develop, but you gave up halfway - now you've abandoned him! You say it wasn't your own idea, so you're in pain and sad, but what use is that to a withered body that has been drifting and destroyed, tormented, and eroded by society and the world?</p>
<p>"My youth has been completely destroyed by slave life. Now I only hope that you can enjoy your precious youth! I bless you, girl!"</p>
<p>These words are completely rational. The accumulated depression of ten years is spoken today to the person who loved me ten years ago. The important thing is to hope that she can give me new strength and prepare me to move forward on a different path! Ying'er has grown so lovely, and the shyness of a virgin has been replaced by the charm of a young woman! The pair of soft pillows and shining fur bedding on this bed let people know that she has been captured by "position" and "money"! I stared obsessively at her face, and she stared obsessively at my face. We were silent with each other for a long time. Suddenly, she grabbed my shoulders with both hands, shook them a few times, and said:</p>
<p>"Don't be like this! I'm afraid of your eyes! Like, like a wounded wolf looking at you. Look, red veins are webbed on your white crow bead! Let me tell you, my life will end in this cage, forever imprisoned, forever imprisoned!"</p>
<p>"Is there no room for salvation?"</p>
<p>"No, there is no room for salvation! But you should still try to throw off the stone on your shoulders and crush the people standing on the stone to death, even if I am among them, I am willing. You don't have to worry about me anymore, let our past become a source of memories! I have been worthy of you; please never forget that the person who first shook my virgin's sacred heart was you! You will be happy if you are not for yourself alone. I hope you, I hope you will unite all the slaves - - - raise their heads and attack the rulers and exploiters, I am waiting, willing to be your prisoner!

<p>My "China" is after all a land of culture and civilization, and the literary style is flourishing. Therefore, the style of "elegance" and "grace" is emulated by those above and below. What "governing by doing nothing," "governing by playing the zither," "governing while lying down," and even "governing with half of the Analects" are all things that have been done since ancient times. And now, in a phrase, it is the autumn of "national hardship." The general so-called "scholar-officials," now called "important people" and "celebrities," are also busy publishing lofty opinions to save the times. Some advocate saving the country through Buddhism, some advocate saving the country through Taijiquan, and some advocate saving the country through entertainment. Others, such as "long-term resistance," "non-resistance," and "asking the great powers for moral help," are all not lacking a "纶巾羽扇" "graceful" and "elegant" attitude. And what is even more admirable is that not long ago, some "doctors" and "scholars" proposed to make Peiping a "cultural city"! This proposal is not only extremely clever, but also fully demonstrates the "elegant" nature of scholars who maintain culture and transcend the world!</p>
<p>Many people firmly advocate the "China will not perish theory." At first, I was very skeptical, but then I understood that it must be because there are many "doctors" and "scholars" in our country, and a lineage of civilization will certainly not be completely lost. Therefore, even though "barbaric" imperialists are barbaric and despite the outbreak of World War II, I can still advocate "saving the country through reading" and "minding my own business," because not doing so would make the ancient cultural country lose face, which is worse than the destruction of the country.</p>
<p>"Saving the country through reading" and advocating "Peiping as a cultural city" are naturally two inseparable things in essence. This is to say that the source of these propositions is all from "elegance" and "grace." But I think that calling Peiping a "cultural city" is not thorough enough. Basically, China is a "cultural country." It is better to erect large cultural country arches in the four borders of China. In that case, "Jiang Taigong is here, there are no taboos." Considering the face of culture, the great powers will naturally take into account the future of "culture" and be more polite to China.</p>
<p>Recently, Shanhaiguan fell again, and the "martialized" Japanese army seems to have a strong momentum to invade North China. I think that sooner or later, doctors and scholars will surely erect a large "elegant" sign on the city wall of Peiping, writing "Culture City is here." In this way, the guns and cannons of the Japanese army may only dare to fire into the sky.</p>
<p>"The cultural city head repels martial people." We remotely wish our ancient capital peace and tranquility through "culture."</p>
<p>Night on Nanjing Road   Shuji</p>
<p>At the center of the crossroads, an Indian Sikh stands tall and majestic inside something that looks like a flagpole stand in front of an ancient prince's mansion. The electric bell rang, red light, green light, the air drunkenly shrouded the cars, trams, rickshaws, and pedestrians on the road, going crazy: : : .</p>
<p>There is no quiet or harmony here, only filled with noise, terror, and chaos.</p>
<p>Cars stopped at the intersection, one after another: : : Red light shone into the car, young women, glamorous, charming, and wealthy, thoroughly modernized. Clinging tightly to the big belly of a newly suited man, charming eyes, intoxicating smile.</p>
<p>||Rickshaw|| It's a woman's voice.</p>
<p>||Tianyun Building!</p>
<p>||Sincere Company!</p>
<p>The elevators in the amusement park were filled time and time again with visitors of all classes and colors, constantly going up and down.</p>
<p>There are inexplicable national operas, witty civilized dramas, and licentious Suzhou operas and ditties there: : :</p>
<p>One flirtatious glance, two flirtatious glances, three flirtatious glances, and then tailing.</p>
<p>The madam is here,</p>
<p>||Sir, would you like to go have some fun?||</p>
<p>The rickshaws decorated with colorful small electric lights galloped on the smooth asphalt road, one pulling in the front and one pushing in the back, with the grand style of Yue Fei's "Zhang Bao in front of the horse, Wang Heng behind the horse."</p>
<p>×× Hotel, ×× Building, ×× Restaurant: : :</p>
<p>Changsan? Yaoer? The heart of a pervert.</p>
<p>In this place, everything seems to require cleverness, and naturally, beggars are no exception. The newspaper is rolled into a small bucket, following a pedestrian closely. The sound is always low and monotonous. The mouths of beggars in other places are all full of flattering "promotion" and "fortune," but here it is a bit different. They don't hope to arouse your pity, only hope to arouse your disgust. They know that if you want to avoid these annoyances, you must make a little sacrifice. Therefore, young lovers walking arm in arm and whispering secrets are their supreme patrons.</p>
<p>Filled with busyness, filled with leisure, filled with happiness, filled with sorrow, bitter tears, reflecting smiling faces, coming in a hurry, leaving in a hurry.</p>
<p>The night is deep, and the cars, horses, and pedestrians are gradually becoming scarce. Little Ao San hunched over, folded his hands and leaned against the cement wall, pretending to be asleep. The rickshaws surrounded the entrance of the amusement park.</p>
<p>The amusement park closed, and there was another burst of noise, and finally it was quiet, quiet.</p>
<p>A WatenCan sped by, and the sweat, blood, and tears accumulated in a day flowed into the Huangpu River along with the sewage through the sewers, far away, vaguely!</p>
<p>Morning   Li Li</p>
<p>In the early morning, I stood in the vast wilderness. Although the east was gradually changing color, the sun had not yet come out.</p>
<p>Not a single person, not even a dog, nothing was there. Looking over, it was just a vast expanse.</p>
<p>The crowing of roosters gradually rose from all directions. Chirping and chirping, the birds woke up and were also calling, this was joy for the light.</p>
<p>At this time, the barking of dogs in the middle of the night was gone. Wang, wang, wang, that annoying sound. What was it like in the sky? There were very few stars, only the bigger ones remained, emitting a glittering light; the so-called blue sky came especially beautifully at this time, extraordinarily blue and clear.</p>
<p>Slowly, the color of the east changed from tender green to light white to pale red, this was a sign that the sun was about to come out!</p>
<p>This pale red spread out, and almost the entire earth was about to change color. Joy filled the hearts of all things.</p>
<p>One change, another change: : : The sun poked its head out, and the red light filled the entire wilderness, covering the entire world.</p>
<p>This is not called morning, but dawn.</p>
<p>Grinding Life   Man</p>
<p>Holding my own life, aiming at a stubborn stone, I arranged the slaughterhouse, wanting to grind myself to death alive.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>The prosperous world is arranged for you, but you don't know how to enjoy it and destroy it instead; has life ever failed you in the slightest? You rebellious ghost of life!</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Heavier or lighter, I deliberately grind, holding you in my hand, where can you hide? A slight rustling sound comes from the stone, I lengthen my ears to carefully appreciate it.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Life held in my hand gradually becomes thin, blood and flesh ground on the stone gradually increase. How long can you struggle? I coldly mock my half-dead corpse.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>The universe rings the death knell, life has been ground to death, releasing the demonic palm, exhaling a light breath; but far away, far away, a rooster crows, and the bright blood illuminates the black sky and earth.</p>
<p>Long Creative Era and the Crossroads of Love (Continued)   Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Why are you still letting them live in this house?"</p>
<p>After he asked this question, he couldn't help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>"He's about to go back, if he doesn't leave tomorrow, he'll leave the day after tomorrow. : : : I told them to leave long ago, but things haven't been settled yet. They're really harmful! : : :"</p>
<p>"What did they do to harm you?"</p>
<p>Haiquan immediately felt a kind of schadenfreude.</p>
<p>"It's made Mr. Lin misunderstand me. I'm really sorry, Mr. Lin, for making you unhappy for so many days!"</p>
<p>"What does it have to do with me? But when Mr. Zeng finds out, : : :"</p>
<p>He pretended to be calm and sarcastic.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Lin, don't be too suspicious of people!"</p>
<p>At this moment, she changed her cautious attitude just now and laughed in a very interesting way after speaking.</p>
<p>": : : : : : : : : :"</p>
<p>He was a little strange about her again, why she laughed so much. He quickly revived the relaxed attitude he had just had.</p>
<p>"Really, don't be so angry with me anymore. Seeing Mr. Lin angry, you really don't know how sad I am in my heart!" she said pleadingly.</p>
<p>": : : : : : :"</p>
<p>He didn't answer, just went to the desk to pack his bag.</p>
<p>"Can't you really take a day off today?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hezi tilted her head and kept looking at him with a smile. Only now did he notice that she wasn't wearing socks on her feet. Although she had added a fur cheongsam outside, a pair of snow-white lower legs were still exposed under the hem of the cheongsam. His will suddenly wavered a bit. He thought it wouldn't hurt to skip class, and he could borrow notes from classmates tomorrow. He had rarely been absent before, and skipping class for three or two days wouldn't affect his studies much. He really wanted to agree to take a day off and go to the park to see a movie with her. Because he had been longing for her for a few days, as if they had been apart for months.</p>
<p>But Liu Peizhu's fair face and rational expression suddenly flashed before his eyes. At the same time, he remembered what she said in her letter.</p>
<p>": : : You are too suspicious of me. Your words are all unnecessary, extremely cheap sentimentality. I hope you will cheer up your youth-period morbidity in the future. Our friendship is extremely sincere and will never change because we are separated. Whether it is friendship or love, if it must be maintained by two people staying together for life, then it is certainly not a sincere friendship or love, I dare say. Haiquan, we can only work hard towards our future, improve our studies, and increase our status. Then, our love can also become stronger day by day. : : : Didn't you say that our relationship started from art - - - that is, from learning, coupled with the guarantee of each other's personality, there will be further development. : : : It's good that I can see you soon, because I have decided to come to Shanghai to study with my brother and sister-in-law next spring." : : : :</p>
<p>"Can't take a day off."</p>
<p>He hurriedly answered Mrs. Hezi simply.</p>
<p>"You still can't forgive me?"</p>
<p>She said quietly.</p>

<p>Anticipating Swap Premium, Small Gold Price Falls, Three Two One</p>
<p>Empty Side Posts Premium of Two Taels, Gradually Decreasing to Break-Even</p>
<p>Finally, Extremely Many Who Settled at Four or Five Mace</p>
<p>(Focus Shifts to Increasingly Rare Swap Transactions)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a slight contraction of 0625 in the big market, a decrease of 25 in British and American exchange rates, while the American and British markets remained unchanged, American banks fell 125, and the price of forward silver was mixed with gains and losses, but in small numbers. However, this price had already been achieved the day before. Therefore, the market did not rise sharply at the opening yesterday morning. Instead, as people's hearts stabilized due to the swap, the opening price was 804 taels and 2 mace. The bank opened tightly, once reaching 807 taels and 8 mace. Later, because Wahbi sold off March US dollars at 28 yuan, the price began to fluctuate. Finally, it rose and fell with the swap premium. Although there were fluctuations of over 7 taels during the half-day period, each number was watching the swap, so the trading volume in the market was still small. As predicted by this newspaper yesterday, the empty side first called for a premium of about two taels, then gradually increased to about three taels. Spot merchants bravely swapped out long positions, and the premium gradually decreased. The gold market's empty side saw profit and sold off, subsequently falling to 006 mace. Fuchang vigorously bid, once falling to break-even. Hengxing and others first posted short positions on behalf of customers, then slightly increased to 078 mace. Thereafter, there were occasional fluctuations of several mace, and the gold price also hovered around one tael. By closing, it was 801 taels, first rising and then falling, with a trend that seemed to be weakening. In addition, with a small swap premium, people seemed to see it as small. The market situation for half a day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Market Lively at First Half Day, Then Weakens)</p>
<p>The morning opening was uneventful, at 804 taels and 2 mace, slightly better by one mace than the previous close. Goods were cashed out, reaching 04 taels. (Goods opened at 804 taels) Fuyu, Hengyu, and Laichin purchased, and retail investors also purchased, rising to 2 taels, at 06 taels. Goods were slightly sold off, at 05 taels and 2 mace. At this point, trading had become stagnant, presenting a sluggish appearance. When Hengxing and Laichin delivered, it was at 5 taels and a half. Dadecheng also purchased, rising to 6 taels and 3 mace. The exchange rate for January US dollars at 875 was not easy to sell off, falling again to 5 taels and a half. Thereafter, the market showed signs of recovery. Fuxing Yong purchased bars, and the price hovered. The exchange market also revealed a ray of light. Dongya took in March US dollars at 28 yuan. Zhaofengchang, Hengyu advanced to about 7 taels. Wanxing slightly sold off, falling back 5 or 6 mace. Zhaofengchang and Fuyu advanced again, then jumping to 07 taels and 8 mace. This was when pre-swap trading began. Wahbi sold off March US dollars at 28 yuan, then prices were seen downstream. However, the bar amount was not large, and the decline was not fierce. Then, spot merchants were willing to swap out long positions, and the premium trended lower. Fuyu then sold off, at about 5 taels. At this time, banks were alternating for April US dollars at 0625, and the gold price also hovered between 4 and 5 taels. The swap premium fell to within 2 taels, and the multi-side Fuchang also tended to sell, then to 02 taels and 9 mace. Hengxing opened for the Central Bank, and the price reversed high, rising to 4 taels and 4 mace. However, April US dollars had already been done at 125, and the swap was getting smaller and smaller. The empty side's prestige was strong. Zhaofengchang and Hengyu went to the market to sell off, falling to 2 taels. The trading floor was extremely narrow. Although Hengxing entered the bars in small numbers, it was raised again to outside 3 taels. Yongfeng slightly sold, at 2 taels and a half. March US dollars were done at 0625, and Tianfeng Yong fiercely sold off, falling to 2 taels, to 006 mace. Hengyu also sold bars at this time. Later, because the swap was slightly better, the market closed again at 801 taels. After closing, goods were unsettled, only trading at 799 taels and a half to close, while the gold industry was still trading at 045 mace at this time. The maximum during the half-day was 807 taels and 8 mace, and the minimum was 800 taels and 006 mace, with a fluctuation of 7 taels and 2 mace. The final result was a drop of 3 taels and 1 mace lower than the previous close.</p>
<p>(Price Increase Mostly Suppressed, Three Taels Strong)</p>
<p>Because the HSBC listing did not move, it was the same as the day before. The combined gold price was 868 taels, 7 mace, and 8 fen. According to the closing price, it suppressed about 67 taels, more than 3 taels stronger than the previous close. The January ledger price and the February price were the same at 801 taels, and the make-up water was 799 taels.</p>
<p>(Each Number Had No Time to Trade Whole Numbers)</p>
<p>There was extremely little trading on the floor. In summary, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Fuxing, Yongzhaofengchang, Yifeng, Qingfa, Yongdeng all entered, while Wanxing, Daxingyongtianfeng, Yongrichang, Zhifeng, Yongyongfeng all exited. Zhaofengchang, Fuyu, Hengyu etc. first advanced then exited, while goods sets sold off. There was not much trading among the Dalian gangs. The Guang gang, Hengxing, advanced over a hundred bars on behalf of the Central Bank, and also transacted small numbers in and out. Although Yifeng entered, it did not reach a hundred bars. Other trades were sporadic, because they were busy with swaps.</p>
<p>(Broiled Red and Continuous Calm)</p>
<p>The opening price yesterday still calculated at an increase of 9 taels. Yingfeng Heng still sold to Dafeng Heng, totaling 140 taels.</p>
<p>(Pre-Swap Process)</p>
<p>This swap (February to March) needs to be done one day early because next Monday is a holiday, and the industry must do it a day early. As today is a regular Saturday holiday, the pre-swap was performed yesterday. The empty side first called for a premium of two taels at the beginning (Fuyu), while the multi-side called for three taels (Dalian gang). Hengyu, etc. immediately posted a premium of two taels, 7 or 8 mace. Later, Yifeng came to swap at a limit price of two taels and 8 mace, and Hengyu immediately dropped back to about two taels and a half. Spot merchants were willing to bid in order to swap out long positions, and the price gradually decreased to 2 taels. The empty side, such as Hengyu, Changsheng, Yongfuyu, all posted, while the multi-side then Daliangang, Yifeng, Chunyuan, Yongdai, and existing spot numbers Tongfenghong, Wanxing also competed to</p>

<h3>The Proper Understanding of "Inert Nations"</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>'::The Chinese nation is indeed an inert nation. The methods adopted by the Japanese to deal with this kind of inert nation are very appropriate. If such methods were applied to any Western nation, there would be no peace for even a day::' The above passage is a section from a commentary in a certain Western newspaper, reported in the Shen Bao's Beijing dispatch on the 11th of this month, titled "Tears of Blood in the Northeast," which speaks for the Japanese. When we read such ridiculing remarks, we are bound to be angry and find it shameful. However, if we recall the insults Chinese people have suffered, this is just one of the most blatant examples we've heard recently. Therefore, to wipe out this shame, a momentary fit of anger is not enough. We must investigate this insulting criticism and see if the claims made about us have any truth to them. We are not afraid of having shortcomings, but we are afraid of not understanding the reasons for these shortcomings and striving to find ways to remedy them. This is the awareness and determination we should have at this critical moment of national survival.</p>
<p>What is an "inert nation"? The word "inert" can be said to encompass meanings such as "not striving, not seeking progress, enduring humiliation to survive, lacking the spirit of struggle." Is this the kind of situation our nation has presented in the past? We may as well calmly reflect on it. Since the September 18th Incident and the failure of the Shanghai War, during this so-called period of national crisis, we have seen the same old turmoil in the national party, government, and military, and the same old numbness among the people. To be honest, many of our own countrymen have deeply felt that the "lack of vigor" and decline of this national spirit have reached an extreme point, and they particularly feel that the issue of national revival is something that is impossible to start with and extremely difficult. There is also a group of countrymen who believe that our national spirit resides in familism. Now that the spirit of the family system is becoming increasingly fragmented, this inherent national spirit has also lost its foundation and completely disappeared. The remedy lies in creating a new national spirit and establishing a new nation-state. There are also those eugenicists who believe that the race of people in a large part of China is ancient and weak, so this entire nation is also trending towards an ancient and weak path. Their solution is to fundamentally start with improving the race.</p>
<p>The three criticisms of national character mentioned above each have their own theoretical standpoint and factual basis, which cannot be completely erased or denied. The so-called "inert nation" is, at most, like this. What we should pay attention to is the proper understanding and recognition of this kind of criticism, which can now be discussed in two points:</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of the expression of national spirit since the national crisis, we express considerable agreement with the above criticisms. As long as we have the determination to revitalize, we are always welcoming of criticisms of our own shortcomings, so why fear being pointed out? What we should strive to reflect on is that, on the one hand, we lack the determination and courage to reform and revitalize, and on the other hand, we try to avoid opposing criticisms. This kind of atmosphere has a great influence in domestic politics and society, and this is what we want to loudly call for and strive to correct. Furthermore, we should first understand the source of our own national shortcomings and establish our own propositions and confidence in national revival. Then, we will have a basis for judging right and wrong or criticizing a part of the errors in other criticisms. Because criticisms that are born out of anger, theorizing, and sarcasm are often shallow, far-fetched, and sharp. If we ourselves do not understand first, then we cannot talk about propositions and the determination to revitalize, and we will easily be discouraged by shallow opinions, demoralized by far-fetched theories, and angered by sharp criticisms! As a result, we will still achieve nothing.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the above three criticisms of national shortcomings, our consistent understanding and recognition is this: The decline of national spirit to an extreme point is indeed an undeniable fact. But to say that it is at its worst today is specious. If we study the past history of losing rights and humiliating the country and the performance of national spirit in various periods, we can know that the extreme state of national decadence has actually passed and is no longer today. Now, it is an awakened decadent nation, struggling and resisting imperialists here. To say that the Chinese national spirit has dissipated with the family system is not to know that the Chinese people's shallow concept of the nation is due to the family system. In fact, the patriotism of the people today has increased because of the collapse of the family system. Based on this reason, we can also use the same words to answer the opinions of those gentlemen who believe that the lack of vigor of the national spirit today is due to racial aging. We know that the cultivation of a national spirit is entirely a product of the national system and historical environment. It belongs more to social heredity and less to physiological heredity. Now, no one can prove that the average intelligence of every Chinese person is inferior to that of Japanese, Russian, Italian, British, American, or German people. However, the organizational nature of the Chinese nation is obviously different from that of the major powers. This is the result of the legacy of past culture and systems and cannot be confused with physiological heredity. As for the criticism of "inert nations," our above explanation has answered this sarcastic ridicule. If we go a step further, we have our own understanding of the cause of our nation's "inertia." We believe that our nation is on the road to revival, but we dare not take the path of various "non-inert" nations – under the individual capitalist system – in the past, which led to all kinds of "non-inert" massacres, and the path of even more tragic massacres in the future! This is another profound impression we have gained after hearing the criticism of "inert nations."</p>
<p>In short, the criticism that we are an "inert nation" is not without reason. As long as we unite and organize the hardworking and resilient spirit of each of us, we can become a "non-inert nation." We are now standing in the midst of the great transformation of the world's old and new systems, struggling under the impact of this transformation. This is a critical moment for national survival. We must have the determination and confidence to do the work of national revival. We should use organized and methodical methods, combine like-minded people, loudly call for awakening all those with blood and spirit throughout the country, and then popularize it to the entire people. Under the goal of reviving the nation and cultivating the national spirit, we should all do our best, work hard, cooperate, and make painstaking efforts. Then, this vast land of China may be spared the danger of sinking!</p>

<h3>The Psychology of Shop Assistants Neglecting Customers</h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>(The Issue of Shop Assistants Treating Customers Poorly)</p>
<p>Having read two articles in previous issues of this publication discussing the problem of shop assistants neglecting customers, one by You Ping, "Why Do Shop Assistants Neglect Customers?" and the other by Jing Xiangdi, "My View on Shop Assistants Neglecting Customers," based on my personal opinion, I feel that the former is not to the point, while the latter is also not a thorough discussion. The reasons stated by the two gentlemen are, at most, a few components of neglecting customers!</p>
<p>The society of Shanghai is purely made up of the two words "snobbish," which is the so-called snobbish society of "only serving the clothes, not the person!" General shop assistants with shallow knowledge, unable to withstand the daily influence of what they see and hear, unconsciously develop a snobbish concept and treat customers differently according to their status. Their only psychology is to worship the rich and despise the poor. This applies to both men and women (although young and fashionable women are, of course, more valued). What they welcome most and consider worthy of attentive service are customers with beautiful clothes and extravagant manners. On the contrary, if they see someone in plain clothes and with humble manners, they show an unhappy expression, even giving them cold shoulders. Therefore, they treat the car class and fashionable people differently from (Important text continues on page 20)</p>

<p>the common people and villagers, each with a different face. This is not a groundless accusation, but based on what I have seen.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to prepare for the New Year, I came to Shanghai to buy some necessities. In a foreign goods store on Fuzhou Road, I bought some toys for children. At the same time, a rustic villager came in. Several shop assistants acted as if they didn't see him and ignored him. When he opened his mouth to ask, one of the shop assistants reluctantly greeted him. He bought a few feet of cloth made by the factory. When the shop assistant measured it with a ruler and was about to cut it, he politely asked to add a little more. The shop assistant threw down the scissors, put on a stern face, and said, "Our store is full measure plus three, which is already enough. What are you still fussing about?" He was rebuffed and dared not say anything else, letting him do whatever he wanted. After he left the store, the shop assistant even cursed, "I'm wronged to death!" At this time, a gentlemanly man came in, followed by his family. It happened that the same shop assistant went over to serve him. But his attitude was no longer as arrogant as before. He immediately put on a kind expression, pointing out the goods in the counter in detail and speaking earnestly, without fear of being verbose. After such a long time of flattery, the woman felt embarrassed and suggested buying a dozen and a half feet of white bamboo cloth. When it was time to cut it, she asked him to add a few inches. He readily said, "Yes, yes," and released his hand, adding about a foot. He also said, "How much is a foot or so worth?" Then he wrapped it up for them. When they left, he bowed and saw them off respectfully. Just think, it's the same shop assistant, why treat customers so differently? Isn't this a full expression of snobbishness? However, this phenomenon is not universal. There are still shop assistants who have not been infected with this bad habit. Because my clothes were not beautiful, but the shop assistant who dealt with me was very polite!</p>
<p>To get rid of this bad concept, then, as Jing Xiangding said, it requires "the shaping power of education!"</p>
<p>Why don't the property-owning shop owners arise and carefully consider extracurricular education?</p>

<h3>A Multi-Layered Liver Full of Contradictions — Muren</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>(Multi-Layered Life)</p>
<p>If I am an employee? Then, I am also an employer; if I am a student? Then, I am also a teacher. Therefore, within the same period, I am living the life of a commanded employee, the life of a commanding employer, the life of a taught student, and the life of a teaching teacher. Under these fundamentally contradictory circumstances, people who do not know the truth may say that I am bragging: However, the fact is, after all, the fact, which then sparked my motive for writing this article.</p>
<p>Let's be frank, I am an accountant at a certain company, spending all day only with the company of abacuses and accounting books, but moving between modern offices and appearing before majestic compradors seems to be an unavoidable side job for me. Therefore, I carefully and basely learn what rules should be in the office and what manners should be in front of the comprador. Because experienced colleagues told me that this is the "rice bowl kinh."</p>
<p>But, once I get home, I am not satisfied with any "rice bowl kinh"; because, at that time, I have already jumped to become a prestigious employer. Located in an antique-heavy shop, no matter when, everyone will fear me, no, everyone will obey me. As long as I move my lips, they will all give me the most respectful manners in response, in short, the same attitude as when I deal with the comprador in the company. Why is this? Is it because they also understand the "rice bowl kinh", isn't it?</p>
<p>However, when I stand in the position of being hired, I often feel, no, or perhaps I still miss the interest of reading. The longer the days of being employed, the higher the interest I hold. So, in order to be driven by this heavy desire for knowledge, I bravely entered a certain night school to be a student again. There, I enthusiastically exchanged knowledge with friends, quietly receiving the cultivation of professors. I talked and laughed with male classmates, and made faces with female classmates. With laughter and scolding, the joy was harmonious. I often thought that the golden age of the past was now alive in front of me.</p>
<p>Reading is, after all, happy, but is teaching more happy? This is a question that is constantly circling in my mind. When the ideal beats the suspicion, I pulled a few "eyed people" like a husband, and even stole time from being busy to happily become a volunteer teacher. However, the result is like this: dictionaries have been messed up a lot, and I have tasted the taste of lead powder. The so-called more happiness in happiness, is probably these, right?</p>
<p>People who are dominated by the environment are living his contradictory and multi-layered life in this way.</p>

<h3>Candy King — Wang Cangping</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I finally had endless good fortune. Thanks to my old friend Shao (Yiqun), I had a feast at Guanshengyuan, and also introduced me to the candy king Xi Guansheng. We had a pleasant chat for two hours. Mr. Xi kindly led us to visit all parts of the factory. He said: The raw materials we need are about 1,000 kinds, and there are also hundreds of kinds of candies produced. According to the tastes of the Chinese people, although so many kinds are not needed in actual need, all kinds of businesses in our country are behind foreigners. Just in the candy industry, their patterns and types are as many as hundreds of kinds. Since I have done this candy business, I should take on my mission and do my best to fight with them. Even if I can't keep pace with them, I won't be left behind! After hearing these words, we can't help but admire Mr. Xi's great vision.</p>
<p>Every day, before dawn, he sticks his head out of the warm bed, braves the wind and cold, and enters the factory to direct everything. Even the smallest details must be considered by him, so he knows everything inside and outside the factory, regardless of size.</p>
<p>He is able to make the most of his employees in the factory, and each is properly placed according to their strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, whether it is in order or work efficiency, good results can be achieved everywhere. He also runs a school for the children of the employees in the candy industry. In addition to hiring experts to be responsible for teaching, Mr. Xi also takes time out of his spare time every day to take on the work of teaching to cultivate talents in the candy industry. Whether the graduates stay in the factory or not is up to each person's voluntary, and there are no harsh conditions at all. Since he can treat people like this, the children who stay in the factory can of course serve to the best of their ability. Even the children who do not stay in the factory, they have already become specialists in the candy industry, and indirectly there is one more talent to fight against the foreign candy industry. In this way, the future of the Chinese candy industry is limitless, and this point cannot but be attributed to Mr. Xi.</p>

<h3>Full Staff</h3>
<p>— Li Peilin</p>
<p>"Jinsheng, take the iron to add some charcoal." The tailor shop owner harshly ordered his snot-nosed apprentice. Jinsheng responded, took the iron, and went out. He had just started the fire and came back in when he was startled by his master's scolding: "What, where did that cigarette butt I pressed under the cutting board last night go? Could it be that you little devil stole it to smoke again?"</p>
<p>"Master, I... I... didn't know." Jinsheng's hand holding the iron trembled slightly.</p>
<p>"Didn't know? Would a cigarette butt fly away by itself? You're a thief, and you still won't admit it!"</p>
<p>"I... I really didn't..."</p>
<p>"What's going on? Making such a racket early in the morning. Jinsheng, the kerosene is dry. Go to the tobacco and paper shop next door and get five copper coins' worth."</p>
<p>It was the owner's wife, standing halfway up the stairs with messy hair, speaking in a sharp voice. Jinsheng carefully put down the iron, walked to the stairs, took the kerosene can and copper coins. As he was about to leave, the owner's wife reminded him a second time: "Wait! The eldest young master is going to school. You go with him. And here are ten more copper coins. Buy a deep-fried dough stick and two pieces of dried tofu. Buy bean sprouts with the rest."</p>
<p>The eldest young master, the owner's son, didn't want to go to school. He was crying, holding onto his mother's pants and refusing to let go. Jinsheng finally managed to drag him down from halfway up the stairs, even receiving a few small punches as a reward. As he led the eldest young master out the door, he turned back and asked worriedly, "Mistress, five copper coins for kerosene, one deep-fried dough stick, two pieces of dried tofu, and three copper coins for bean sprouts, right?"</p>
<p>After lunch, Wang Arong, the owner of Wang Rongji's Suzhou and Guangdong Clothing Shop, wearing a pair of old reading glasses on the tip of his nose, with tears from yawning hanging in the corners of his eyes, was sewing a sheepskin jacket with a sporadic stitch here and there, constantly rubbing the needle tip he was pinching against his scalp. The proprietress silently held their daughter, who was less than a year old, planning in her mind what categories to bet on in the flower gambling game today. Jinsheng was struggling to wash his younger sister's diapers, his movements appearing dull. The room was temporarily silent.</p>
<p>"The end of the year is approaching again," the owner said to his wife, who was absentmindedly trying to recall last night's dream, "Why is business still so slow? The Zhang mansion hasn't added many clothes this season either."</p>
<p>"You don't work hard yourself, and you don't even hire any assistants! Like the Li tailor next door, he hired four masters and is still busy all day long," the owner's wife complained.</p>
<p>"Assistants? How can I hire assistants without business? It's a waste that this kid has been learning the trade for more than two years. He doesn't have any skills. He can't even cut a pair of pants even though he's about to finish his apprenticeship next year. How can I ask him to go out and do business for me?"</p>
<p>Skills. Jinsheng was completely clueless about the meaning of these two words. His master had never taught him any skills. He only knew how to be at someone's beck and call all day long, doing odd jobs. Where would he have learned any "skills"? And where would he have had any spare time to learn "skills"?</p>
<p>An old nanny came in from outside. This was the nanny from the Zhang mansion. She was holding a flat package in her hand, with a circle of high, stiff collar protruding from the outside of the package. It was obviously a woman's dress.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" the owner stood up to greet her. "Auntie Liu, is the waist of this cheongsam too tight? The third concubine in the mansion asked you to bring it to be altered? When I was cutting it, I told her that this size would be a little small..."</p>
<p>"No... I can't... live with his... coming..." She opened the package.</p>
<p>"Look, you burned a hole in the cuff. The young mistress said she doesn't want it anymore and wants you to pay for it. Otherwise, she'll deduct it from your tailoring wages!"</p>
<p>"What, a cigarette burn? Let me take a closer look. Oh! Really, a scorch mark here! Oh! This must be Jinsheng's fault. Damn it, this kid was delivering the cheongsam and secretly smoked a cigarette, but dropped a spark onto the velvet! Jinsheng, come here!"</p>
<p>He was stunned. The two hands soaking in the washbasin washing diapers stopped moving, and his eyes stared blankly at his master's face. The owner grabbed his ear and pointed to the cuff of the cheongsam on the cutting board, asking him, "Did you burn this cigarette hole!"</p>
<p>"No... it wasn't... me... I... didn't..." The two wet hands waved wildly.</p>
<p>(Important text continues on page 3)</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>"You didn't do it? Humph, I never smoke when I'm working. You still want to deny it!" The owner raised the ruler, and with a slap, a bruise appeared on Jinsheng's forehead. Then, slap, slap: "Ah... I... didn't..." "You're strong, you're strong," slap, slap, slap...</p>
<p>Auntie Liu couldn't bear to watch anymore. She and the proprietress dragged them apart with all their might. She said:</p>
<p>"Boss, what's the use of just hitting him? He didn't burn the hole on purpose."</p>
<p>"Auntie Liu, if you hadn't pulled me away, I would have wanted to beat this kid to death!" The owner was panting.</p>
<p>"Enough nonsense. Since it was his carelessness that caused the damage, then how are you planning to compensate?"</p>
<p>"How about this, Auntie Liu. Please help me plead with the young mistress, asking her to spare this little thief just this once for my sake. Let me take this burned area to the weaving shop to fix it, and ask the young mistress to wear it as is. Luckily, it's not very noticeable. What do you think?"</p>
<p>Auntie Liu left reluctantly. The owner admired his own "negotiating skills." Jinsheng was beaten for no reason. His numb heart, like a calm pond, was slightly disturbed by the wind, but soon calmed down again.</p>
<p>It was late at night. In Jinsheng's room under the stairs, the stuffy air was filled with the smell of mildewed objects. The room was surrounded by piles of furniture. Only a small space was left for Jinsheng to sleep on the floor every night. The dim yellow light emitted by the five-candle light bulb, covered in dust, shone on his blank face, illuminating him as he was mending a torn sock he had just taken off. The owner's wife ran down from upstairs. When she discovered that the light under the stairs was still on, she seemed to have seized an opportunity, a chance to unleash her gossiping skills: "Little devil, what time is it? Why aren't you asleep yet? No wonder you're always sprawled out in bed and can't wake up every morning! Humph, so you're so diligent in taking care of your own things. It's not like you're so unwilling to do proper work. Humph, is my family's electricity bill not high enough? You little rascal wants to use more of it, is that it?"</p>
<p>The owner's wife stomped up the stairs again, grumbling all the way. As soon as the main switch for the light was turned off, Jinsheng found himself surrounded by darkness. He nonchalantly took out the candle stub he had put in his pocket, lit it, and placed it on the floor, continuing to mend his sock. Almost daily occurrences like his daytime experiences had not left any special impression on his mind. He simply muttered naturally, "Anyway, I'll be finished with my apprenticeship next year. Once I'm done, I'll get paid, and a junior apprentice will take my place doing the hard labor. I'll be able to relax. To hell with it, I'll only have to endure these few days." He hoped to "finish his apprenticeship" soon. His only way out was to "finish his apprenticeship."</p>
<p>Self-Employment Introduction</p>
<h3>Road Inspector</h3>
<p>— Zheng Xingjian</p>
<p>In modern society, there are two types of idle people; the first type are those who have food brought to their mouths, money handed to them, who sleep until eleven in the morning, have lunch｜｜which can also be called their breakfast｜｜and then play a few rounds of mahjong, then go to ×× Restaurant for dinner, come out and go to ×× Grand Theater to watch a movie, and then go to ×× Dance Hall to dance until three or four in the morning before returning home. This type is called a waste-materialized idler.</p>
<p>I am also one of the unemployed, but not the kind mentioned above. I belong to the second type. I am a road inspector every day, but not to take a break from work, but to dodge meals. When reading the newspaper, I first look for the recruitment column and the employment column, hoping to find a suitable job. At night, sleeping in bed, I rack my brains to devise a way to find money to pay the rent and buy rice. Twenty-four hours a day, sixty minutes an hour, every minute my brain is thinking about ways to find money.</p>
<p>Hello! Dear readers, do you need an honest young clerk who has a high school level in both Chinese and English, can type in English, has no addictions, can endure hardship, and only requires a monthly salary of about twenty-five yuan? If you agree, please write me a letter. I guarantee you will be very satisfied. My mailing address is Mr. Miao, No. 65 Tongfu Road, this city.</p>
<p>Clerk Communication</p>
<h3>Expression of Human Compassion</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>After reading your reply to me on January 12th, I felt very ashamed. The reason I proposed the method of "riding a horse while looking for a horse" was to consider the facts. Mr. Wu's parents, for the sake of being "unable to take care of themselves," wanted to reduce the burden, so they did not hesitate to choose food and still ordered their son to work in a Japanese store after the Shanghai War. It is clear that they are oppressed by urgent personal problems, and their national ideology and national concept are very weak. If Mr. Wu resigns, Shanghai will have no place to live, and it may not be possible to return to his hometown to eat old rice, right? Therefore, I advise him to endure humiliation for a while, waiting for the arrival of opportunity, and not forget that during the Shanghai War, Hu Amao drove his car into the Huangpu River and died for his country; and the heroic actions of the volunteer soldiers in the icy and snowy weather are fighting to the death!</p>
<p>I am a small clerk in a store, not worthy of being called a "powerful person," but it so happens that a certain store wants to recruit a trainee; I can recommend him.</p>
<p>Editor, please publish Mr. Wu's place of origin, age, and mailing address in the newspaper so that we can contact him by letter; this is very hopeful.</p>
<p>Wu 𣇓yi, 1/13.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. 𣇓鑫 is able to put himself in the shoes of a Mr. Wu whom he has never met, consider the facts, propose practical and feasible methods, and even further provide practical assistance, fully demonstrating the compassion that has been immersed in most people for a long time. We are very admirable! As for Mr. Wu's age, place of origin, and mailing address, we are not able to publish them without his permission. We hope that Mr. 𣇓鑫 will show his mailing address so that we can follow your instructions and copy them one by one.</p>

<p>Movie Special</p>
<h3>From Stage to Screen (Part 2) Hongwei</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Wang Ying She is from Anhui and speaks fluent Mandarin. She has joined many theater companies, such as Xinyou, Modern Avenue, and United. She is a student in the Literature Department of China Public School and can also write articles, but her interest in literature is far less than her passion for drama. Her performance on stage is better than Hu Ping and Ai Xia. Her entry into the film industry is the same as Ai Xia's, first joining Tianyi, and then transferring from Tianyi to Mingxing. She was originally the lead actress in Tianyi's "The Cry of Women," directed by Shen Xiling. More than a thousand feet had already been filmed, but because the results were not very good, the Tianyi authorities, for the sake of caution, were preparing to film it again. However, she and Shen Xiling could not wait and rushed to Mingxing. She still played the lead role, and Shen was still the director. So, this "Cry of Women" cried from Tianyi to Mingxing. Now the film is about to be finished. I wonder if her cry will be loud enough?</p>
<p>Ye Qiuxin She is from Huanggang, Hubei. She is only eighteen years old this year, but she doesn't look like a young girl at all. Her face is a bit like Zhang Zhiyun, but her bright eyes are much better than Zhang Zhiyun's. Among these female playwrights, she ranks first in terms of appearance. She graduated from St. Joseph's Girls' School in Hankou, and has joined the Southern Country, Bright Moon, and other theater companies. She is also good at Peking Opera, and sings Lao Sheng, Xu Sheng, and Qingyi very well. She has performed on stage in theaters such as the Wuhu Singing and Dancing Stage. She once joined the Wuhan Film Company, but soon left. She is now an actress in Tianyi Company, and plays a female educator in the new film "Karma of Two Lovers". Although there are only one or two scenes, it can be seen that she has great hope in the film industry.</p>
<p>Cang Yinqiu She is from Henan. Her father is an official in Beiping, so she followed her father to study in Beiping, graduating from the private Wenzhi Middle School. Later, she entered the small theater of the Art College of Beiping University, specializing in drama. She is talented and smart, and has a lively personality. She is good at singing and dancing. At that time, a Riyue Film Company opened in Beiping and hired her to play the lead role in "Her Environment". Unfortunately, the company's economy was insufficient, and the film was stopped before it was finished. However, her interest in film was still strong, so she packed her bags and went south to join Tianyi Company. Soon, the Road Association invited male and female film stars to hold an amusement conference in the New World. She and Tian Fang, Wang Huijuan, and others performed the play "Oppression;" her fluent Mandarin and profound expressions were well received by the audience. In "Karma of Two Lovers", she plays a Wang family sister-in-law, and her performance is also quite good. (End)</p>
<h3>One Scene of the Lone Army The Lone Army on the Front Line Produced by Dazhong Company</h3>
<h3>Review of "Adventure in the Battlefield"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Worth watching from an anti-imperialist standpoint</p>
<p>This is a film set against the backdrop of the "January 28th" war. Probably in order to make it easier to call the seat, I had to use college students as the center and insert a love story. A group of "ladies" and "young masters" college students, inspired by national disasters, spontaneously organized volunteer soldiers and vowed to serve the country. Among them, there are Huang Zhenhan and Ding Mingxia, two lovers, who also love the country and dare not lag behind. First, they set their lifelong events and went home to visit relatives, and then went to the national disaster together. It was precisely because of this dispersion that each made great achievements. In the end, both love the country and reunite.</p>
<p>Structurally speaking; Although there are many "coincidences" in it, (such as Ding Mingxia stealing maps from the enemy command door, etc.::) but there are not many flaws. There are several places where the power of the people is expressed, such as the refugees gathering to kill two enemy soldiers. Although it is not necessarily how great, the awakening of the individualistic hero car driver Wang A'gen is expressed very powerfully. The scenes such as Raff and the enemy command are inevitably naive.</p>
<p>Director Zhang Shichuan is not necessarily successful in this film, but Wang A'gen's foreshadowing is really commendable. The soldiers had no bullets, perhaps for the sake of saving money. There is no powerful exposure to the war. The artillery and trenches both appear pure and unrealistic. However, because of various objective environments, we should also be particularly forgiving.</p>
<p>The general actors can pass by normally, but the decorations are working hard to "do" the play. Wang Jiting is especially powerful in the latter part.</p>
<p>But generally, there is a lack of composure and too many small movements, which may not be the weakness of domestic films.</p>
<p>The layout is flawless. The lighting is clear, especially when Ding Mingxia peeped from behind the scenes, it was even more beautiful. The subtitles are not very good, especially it is really sad for our old people to think of replacing ×× with the word "bandit". It is also a pity that the lens cannot be used more flexibly.</p>
<p>In short, this is a good movie, especially from an anti-imperialist standpoint, it is worth watching. Although it is not necessarily successful in terms of technique, it is still good in comparison. I hope that Mingxing Company will have better works that can educate the public in our eyes in the near future. Especially for Mr. Zhang Shichuan, we have great hope: to expand and advance in the face of national war!</p>
<h3>Statistics of New Talents in Mingxing</h3>
<p>— Prajna</p>
<p>Doubled in half a year</p>
<p>After January 28th, all industries in Shanghai were depressed, and the film industry was certainly no exception. However, the three major production companies, Mingxing, Lianhua, and Tianyi, were not hindered by the social depression and hindered their enterprising spirit. Speaking of Mingxing Company alone, in the second half of 1932, the number of talents recruited in various fields was as many as two dozen, which is also quite amazing. Now I will replace them with a classified statistics obtained from the investigation, and the report is below!</p>
<p>Director 丨 Li Pingqian Shen Xiling Chen Kangran</p>
<p>Actors 丨 Ai Xia Sun Min Wang Ying Xuan Jinglin</p>
<p>Wang Yiwu Zhao Dan Xu Qinfang Chen Shaomin</p>
<p>Photography 丨 Yan Bingheng Gao Tingzhang</p>
<p>Screenwriter 丨 Yu Tingxun Lu Xiaoluo</p>
<p>Sound Engineer 丨 Situ Huimin</p>
<p>Stage Affairs 丨 Hu Yuexi Zhu Shaoquan</p>
<p>Cartoon 丨 Wan Laiming Wan Guchan</p>
<p>Document 丨 Wang Qianbai</p>
<p>Publicity 丨 Li Junpan</p>
<p>Art 丨 Hu Zhuoyun</p>
<p>Advertising 丨 Gao Jilin</p>
<p>Among these twenty-four staff actors, ten were transferred from Tianyi Company, and four others joined Mingxing for cooperation after Youlian closed down. However, the number of people they added in half a year is more than these twenty-four, and the rest are not very important, so they are not included.</p>
<p>National News</p>
<h3>Addendum to "Two Inventors of Sound Film Machines"</h3>
<p>— Qingxia</p>
<p>In this journal, there was an article by Mr. Ming, "Two Inventors of Sound Film Machines," which described Gu Heming and Zhu Qingxian. In fact, Shi Shipan was also a member of the sound film machine inventor, but he was not recorded in the article; therefore, I wrote it at the back, and I think readers will not think that my move is "adding feet to the snake"!</p>
<p>Speaking of Shi Shipan, not many people know him; however, he already has a considerable history and full achievements in the film industry.</p>
<p>He has a long period of research on photography technology and has served as a photographer for a certain company; later, he felt that the photographic life was boring, and at the same time, he usually liked to study science, so he abandoned the photography work and engaged in the research of sound film machines. This is the beginning of his research on sound film machines.</p>
<p>He failed once, twice; failed twice, three times; until four or five times::: he always kept researching and never gave up; discouraged::: until last October, he succeeded. The first time he recorded sound, he recorded his own talk; the pronunciation was very clear, comparable to imported goods; recently, the Electric Inspection Committee gave him a patent certificate; at the same time, he also received a lot of praise.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the "Grand Hotel" Script</h3>
<p>— Sen</p>
<p>The film "Grand Hotel" published by Mitchlow Company, the original play is by a German woman named Vicki Baum. But how it was introduced to the American screen has a story. It turns out that the person who introduced this script to the manager of Mitchlow Company was the owner of an underwear factory and the manager of a paint shop. The name of the owner is Harry Mases, because his wife's edification, he is very interested in drama, and for this reason, he moved from Chicago to New York City. One day in a foreign bookstore, he inadvertently came across a Menschen in Hotel, and admired it very much, so he bought it. He wanted to put it on stage, but there were many difficulties besides money. He couldn't make a decision, so he asked for help from his friend Bob Vogel. Robert is the manager of a paint shop and is very busy. He threw the book in the drawer and forgot about it. Until one day in April, it rained heavily and there was nothing to do, he remembered the book. After reading it, he also liked it very much, so he wanted to introduce it to the screen. He sent it to the Mitchlow Company. Then, the manager of Mitchlow Company, Irving Thalberg, looked at it and made a decision to adopt it. So, under the names of Harry and Robert, the play was staged in the Broadway Theater and won very enthusiastic praise. Mitchlow Company arranged everything for them, with the film production rights as a condition. Now, Harry may want to find more plays, and Bob has collected the paint shop and is working at Mitchlow Company.</p>
<h3>The Story of "The Match King" (9)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ximeng</p>
<p>She knew that the clothes he was wearing were not for walking. The shoes were thin-soled. The clothes were also very thin. In the mountains of Salzburg, clouds would gather every afternoon, and if it didn't rain, the weather would be very cold. This was the case every day, so Paul's clothes were rarely suitable.</p>
<p>"Can you walk for a long time?" she asked.</p>
<p>"This is my favorite thing."</p>
<p>"The road in the mountains is a bit difficult to walk, right?"</p>
<p>"The harder it is to walk, the more I like it."</p>
<p>"Great, let's climb Mengxuesburg. Can you go?"</p>
<p>"I was just about to suggest that," Paul said without hesitation. "Isn't this a great start? Why are our hobbies so similar?"</p>
<p>"I think:::" Murna said with a smile.</p>
<p>She would occasionally peek at his face. He followed closely to her left and right, making it difficult to walk, but he could still show a happy look, trying his best to follow. When they got into the mountains, it was raining heavily, and their shoes were covered with mud, and their clothes were soaked, sticking tightly to their bodies. Murna herself was wearing thick clothes, specially for walking in the mountains, so her body was not wet at all.</p>
<p>"I like walking in the rain the most, what about you?" Murna said.</p>
<p>"Is there anything more interesting than this in the world?" Paul said indifferently. "The weather below is sunny and breezy, and there is such a heavy rain in the mountains. It is really a spectacle, a rare event in life."</p>
<p>"It rains every day at three o'clock in the afternoon on this mountain," she told him, and looked at him. She knew that he had long understood that this was her prank. But he just smiled and didn't care at all. In the end, she couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration in her heart.</p>
<p>That night, Murna was alone in her room in the hotel, listening to the gramophone, the record was the famous violinist Zilinuo playing "The Pleasures of Love." She continued to play it over and over again, and he was listening to it with great fascination, when he suddenly heard a man's voice: "This is a great start, why are our hobbies so similar?" In the moonlight, she saw the man walking over. His wet clothes were still tightly clinging to his body, and his shoes were covered with mud, which had not been brushed off. "Is there anything more interesting than this in the world?" he said.</p>
<p>He stood quietly under Murna's window listening to Zilinuo's "The Pleasures of Love" for a while, and then he left. After a while, a plane took off from the Salzburg airfield and flapped its wings.</p>
<p>The next night, Murna was still in her room listening to Zilinuo's "The Pleasures of Love." Suddenly, a violin sound came from the garden. The tone was the same as that on the record, but it was clearer and more realistic. She turned off the gramophone and leaned against the window to listen quietly.</p>
<p>"Zilinuo"! She said to her maid with surprise. "It must be Zilinuo himself." She hurried downstairs and walked into the garden. (To be continued)</p>
