<p>四川之畸形政治。實爲全國所罕見。地丁田賦。幾乎月納一次。苛稅雜捐。重。</p>
<p>疊增加又益以土匪之紛擾。内訌之激劇往日繁盛之地。近且變爲墟矣。夫川省一般社會情形。本與東北新開地域不同。據地萬畝以上之大地主除川邊土司外。並不多見。從事於農業者。大多數爲自耕農。大佃戶亦具有耕作工具及相當資本。今日被剝削最深受軍事蹂躪最苦者。多爲此類小有產之農民。而層層剝削之結果。自耕農民至於赤貧。棄地逃荒之舉。在川境已次第發現。其原爲貧農。或有地不足以自活。或依副業爲生之小農。除逃往他鄉成鋌而走險及投身卒伍外。更别無生路。</p>
<p>論理。四川軍隊。收入應有贏餘。應不到欠餉。然而下級士官與夫兵卒之餉項積欠往往積至三五月以上。因是軍隊困窮不堪。人民疲敝愈甚。川中六大軍事巨頭。各據一方。儼然舊日之帝王。其横暴顢頇。或且過之。成都原爲四川之首府文代之中心。亦爲手工業薈萃之區。乃近數年來。因各軍分駐之故。城垣之内政權且不統一殺人放火之人祗須越過某一界限。即可如政治犯之在異國。得受特殊保障。否則得軍事上層領袖一紙名片。亦可安然保釋。罪大惡極之人亦無取締之法。於是法律無效。軍人萬能矣。重慶在表面之秩序。似較成都爲優。其剝削之程度。亦比川西南爲淺。然而勦匪捐愛國捐等則無二致。馬弁護兵之凶惡。亦無時無地不充塞乎街市之間。百姓怨恨而無所宣洩。於是四境騷動而赤匪乃得以三數千殘敗步卒。侵入川境。攻城略地最近且由通南巴三縣。而擾亂宣漢太平城口甚至偷襲綏遠渠縣。竟有使下川東震動。萬縣不安之象矣。</p>
<p>夫川省多兵。世所共知。川省多内戰。亦爲世所共悉。區區土匪。寗不足以削平哉。而乃巨禍蔓延若是。是無他。即各軍之互相猜忌。而無進勦之决心。與一</p>

<p>（南京）　内部以訓政時期即將屆滿、地致之行動使然也。</p>
<p>第一。四川省内各軍。以現有實力論。劉湘所部爲最强。在各軍中亦以劉湘爲比較有向上發展之傾向然而政治上太無建設。經濟上亦無辦法。以致僅有之手工業。亦破敗不堪。農村更無待論。人民對於各軍。旣不能合作。於是發生罅隙。而惡化乃得而乘之矣。其他各軍如鄧如田以至楊劉等。較劉湘遜一籌者更不論矣。此四川剿匪之第一難關也。</p>
<p>第二。四川統一之勢雖漸就完成。而各。軍之猜忌與獨覇一方之企圖。依然如故。各欲圖自己生存保全實力之念多則爲民之念日以少。故匪患在川北而川東袖手。匪攻劉存厚而田劉旁觀窺其用心。乃任隨匪軍撲滅劉部以滅少敵方之勢力。故在劉存厚失敗之過程中。其他各軍。皆取冷靜態度。以坐收漁利之幻想。此四川勦匪之第二難關也。</p>
<p>有斯二者。縱令無土匪騷擾。亦將難免發生巨大之變化。蓋丁此内外多故人心不安之際。社會秩序之横决。隨處堪虞况再加以煽惑乎。故今日爲善後計。須在中樞。一面給地方軍閥以切實之指導。與嚴厲之督責。一面對川省人民。給予以充分之奬掖。務使政治趨於清明。經濟日就安定。然後勦匪乃能收功。星星之火。不致坐成燎原也。</p>

<p>市敎育局長潘公展氏、對新村事業、提倡不遺餘力、曾譯著英國新村市一書、洵足供國人有志於社會改造運動者之參考、近以中國新村建社於滬閔公路之側、闢地數百畝、建築薔薇園新村、對該社計劃、極加讚許、昨特往參觀該新村村址、據潘氏發表、</p>
<h3 id="c192">觀後感想潘氏云、建設新村主要 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>

<h3 id="c193">環境優良　風尙純樸、洵足陶冶身 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>心、而於兒童敎育、亦多裨益、其次則須、</p>

<p>莫不設計週密、</p>
<h3 id="c196">最可稱者　其成本約對公開、且採 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>

<p>且已定出半數、上海人口都市三百餘萬之多、其欲謀住新村者、即以千分之一計、當有三千人、不無供不應求之憾、深望該社諸君能本其精神與毅力、不斷努力、廣爲推行、是不僅居住之福音、且有裨於社會前途、</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>據外國劉伯温的預言，一九三五年至一九三六年之間，世界第二次大戰，將在遠東爆發，而中國的沿海地帶，均將受戰事影響。於是乎一般神經過敏者，都惶惶然寢不安枕，而計劃着上帕米爾高原去避難。這種計劃，是否就是所謂含有幽獸意味，而故意裝成這麽一副張皇失措的神氣，那我可不很明瞭，不過據我在幾次内戰與對外戰爭中所得的經騐，覺得戰爭也並不怎麽可怕。</p>
<p>在戰爭中，自然是有給飛機上扔下炸彈來炸死，給流彈打死，給敵軍當作便衣隊而捕去殺死，給民衆們當作漢奸而活活地打死的危險，但是你若預先掘就了地窖，藏好了精食，等待見了沙袋，鐵絲網，你京鑽進地窖去躱避，萬無一失，若是你太白星坐宮，紫薇星顧命，那麽，命不該絶，儘在外面聞，不打緊。你瞧，歐戰　除了命盡祿絶的死了若干，命不該絶的，到現在兀是很好地活着，吃麵包，喝葡萄酒。</p>
<p>掘地窖子的，自然還是視性命如泰山的人們。人生百年，終不能逃一死，所以想得開些的，却儘着四人坐成一桌，大玩其右傳之十三章，因爲牌聲劈拍，很可以掩住戰線上的槍砲聲，消滅了戰爭的恐怖。</p>
<p>有見識的人們，趕快去開設一個旅館，或是租好幾個亭子樓，三層欄，定能大發其財。小而言之，去包下大批的號外，或是預先的印就些敵軍大將陣亡的當日電報，待到爆竹一響，準也可大獲其利。推背圖，燒餅歌之類，也可推銷得。再說得没志氣些，去當一名小漢奸，也未給不是好買賣之一。</p>
<p>命不該絶的，不用找急，不會被打死的。命盡祿絶的，也不用找急，吃些天花粉，也會得噎死的。戰爭並不像我們理想的那麽可怕，儘不用上帕米爾高原去避難，多不番跋涉。</p>
<h3 id="c245">大王 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 錢健</p>
<p>「大王」二字，無論那個聽到或者看到，都要生出十二分的羡慕與敬仰。因爲「大王」的稱呼，要在一行中獨一無二，才配稱「大王」。實在，「大王」</p>
<p>的稱號，的確是非常難得的，並且世所罕有的。所以「大王」兩字，變成無上的榮稱。</p>
<p>「大王」在外國的銷路很廣，因此「大王」的銜頭得到的也非常的多。譬如汽車方面，有汽車「大王」。煤油方面，有煤油「大王」。鋼鐵方面，有鋼鐵「大王」，還有其他的什麽「大王」，碰碰就是，弄得不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>但是，「大王」在中國有特别的銷塲。雖然汽車没有「大王」，煤油没有「大王」，鋼鐵没有「大王」；而花生有花生「大王」，瓜子有瓜子「大王」，牛肉有牛肉「大王」。把「大王」閙得五花八門，眞是不能開交。</p>
<p>你也稱「大王」，我也稱「大王」，弄到「大王」兩字的本身手足失措，莫衷一是，它丨「大王」丨於是不得不鄭重考慮，左思右想：外國的汽車，煤油，鋼鐵方面要加上「大王」的銜頭，因爲他們是大王而稱「大王」。我自己的「大王」兩字，加在他們身上，是萬分榮幸的。不要說各個稱「大王」的主人都要謝謝我，就是我自己也有無上的光榮。不要說各個主人有面子，就是連我「大王」兩字也有面子的。同時，中國的花生，瓜子，牛肉上也要加上「大王」，眞豈有此理。「大王」的本身不禁愁容滿面，有許多思想湧現在「大王」二字的心頭，它想：中國花生「大王」，瓜子「大王」牛肉「大王」的「大王」，倒要同汽車「大王」，煤油「大王」，鋼鐵「大王」的「大王」混爲一談，這未免太侮辱「大王」了吧丨</p>
<p>「大王」它想的時候，自己覺得十二萬分的襲以爲情；但是在事實上不能加以强詞，只得馬馬虎虎。</p>
<p>最後，「大王」二字的本身，現出一陣諷剌的冷笑。</p>
<h3 id="c246">談幾件關於女人的事 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 小工</p>
<p>我記得幾年前在北平讀書的時候，有一個生得美麗的妇同學，常常拿着許多男人向伊求愛的信，在伊的朋友面前誇示，以爲是無上的光榮，而那時伊的朋友居然也没有一個不在羨慕伊　又有一次我到一個朋友家裏去，適值他的夫人正陪着三位太太打牌。恰好那時又有一個衣飾華員的太太走進來，大家都立起來相迎，其中有一位太太，也許正在注意伊面前的牌，尙未及起立，這位衣飾華貴的太太就馬上跑到伊的面前問伊問道：</p>
<p>「你們老爺在什麽地方做事？」</p>
<p>「在ＸＸ洋行。」</p>
<p>那位太太立刻就扳起面孔向伊厲聲大言道：</p>
<p>「做一個洋行的職員，就這樣的不客氣嗎？丨我們的老爺是ＸＸ銀行的經理丨」</p>
<p>這是多麽光榮呀，丨我們的老爺是銀行經理，但是反過來一想，這正是女人的莫大恥辱。</p>
<p>其實，像這位衣飾華貴的太太，說這句話的時候，伊正未料及他自已的地位，伊以爲伊正個的一個人是絶對的爲伊丈夫的所有物。「打狗要看主人面」，所以伊才敢大胆的駡那位不識相的太太，不該這樣對伊不客氣，因爲我的丈夫······主人······是銀行經理。</p>
<p>由上述的兩件細事，就可以想到現在一般婦女的心理，仍不脫依賴男性的惡習，甚至於自甘暴棄的承認不如男子！這眞是極可恥的事！</p>
<p>這裏，我想起我國從前唯一的女皇帝武則天的一件故事：</p>
<p>唐太宗有一次得到一匹肥駿的良馬，</p>
<p>但是没有一個人能夠駕馭得住，武壟就走上去和太宗道：「我能制得住這匹馬。但要有三件東西：鐵鞭，鐵撾，七首。鞭之不服則撾之，撾之不服則斷其喉丨Ｊ</p>
<p>這是何等的勇敢，何等的魄力，我們無須詳述以後武壟對於婦女解放的偉大功績，祗就這一件事，已足以告訴我們：老上中國就有這樣的一個女姓，伊那剛毅果敢的個性，是不亞於男子的。但是現在的女子，對於武　的感想如何，就不得而知了。</p>

<p>在起伏逶迤的峰巒，聯繞着半疏半密的山林，這裏有崔巍的怪石，勢如虬龍的古樹，複雜而斑爛的紅葉，五光十色地映滿秋山，曲徑懸崖間三兩樵子，挑着薪柴，隱隱地登山而去，使人興感於牧歌的情趣，這便是山間的秋畫。　　但，江上的畫景遠不如山景美妙，那便是山間的色彩實較江上豐富，這色彩，就是無量數的深淺濃淡的葉子染成的，一片葉子就像天空一道虹彩，鳳凰身上的一根美羽，蝴蝶翅上的一粒細粉，是那標自然的織出一幅巨大物的綺麗的秋畫。</p>

<h3 id="c249">談談漫畫 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 黄士英</p>
<p>漫畫，近來可說是很風行了，雜誌報章上面已有零星的發表，尤其在日報附刊上點綴得格外多，專號，特刊，似乎是一件很時髦的衣裳，大家競相效倣，表面上這漫畫已像到了興盛的時期，其實眞的是興盛了嗎？我們不妨從漫　的起源和最近的内容質量來討論一下。</p>
<p>一，漫畫在中國的回溯</p>
<p>在這個盡量吸收西洋文明的東方國家，處處以追隨西方文明爲榮，漫畫亦是歐風東漸的一種；在五年之前，上海的漫畫家曾聯合出版「上海漫畫」，在沉悶的中國社會裏便建立了一座漫畫的基礎，亦是社會人士對於漫畫才得到了初步的認識，不幸這畫報不久卽與世長辭！他不能與初認識的朋友作恒久的集合，然而他的種子却已經散佈開來，他給予讀者的印象，勝過一枚甜美的鮮果，因此喚起一般同志的興趣，從事練習起來了；這是漫畫在中國的第一個階段。此後這些對於漫畫已發生興趣的同志，又繼續出版「中國漫畫」，「星期漫畫」，「玲龍漫畫」等等刊物，雖也不久停刊，而而却因此引起了新聞界的注意；於是從獨立的刊物，而爲報紙的温畫副刊，這可說是漫畫走進了第二個階段。漫畫籍報紙廣大地發生，因此而獲得普遍的讀者之興趣，漫畫在中國的前途，便已展開了一條光芒的大道！</p>
<p>二，今日之畸形狀態</p>
<p>漫畫是一種藝術，借這種藝術的力量來作消極的針砭人生和積極的創造人生，所以漫畫家應該具有一副冷靜的頭腦，去觀察社會的一切隱秘，在輕快靈活的畫法中使人看出自己可笑可憐的眞面目，因此他必得抓住時代的精神，以推進民族的力量！他與文學家雕刻家們佔着同一的重要地位，並且能夠得到更大的效果；但是現在我們的所謂漫畫，又能否完成這種使命呢？</p>
<p>在一切都落後的中國，漫盡亦不出其落後的命連！也許情有可原，但我們在報紙上老是只發見這類膚淺得簡直可笑的東西，未免有些兒黯然失望！我想，多練習，多鼓吹，果然不錯，可是又何必多發表，要知胡亂地畫一張畫，就說是提倡漫畫，結果會愈弄愈糟，非但不能在漫畫上有所建樹，反而喪失了漫畫的眞義，這是一件何等痛心的事！</p>
<p>報紙的編輯先生，固然爲了熱心提倡漫畫的緣故，於是飢不擇食地收羅這些人物，把這責任放在他們的身上，他們有了這等機會，又不痛下工夫，自己力有不違，便抄襲偷竊，於是比原作打一個對折的抄襲作品充斥於刊物裡，這是最近我國漫畫在畸形發展下的一個悲慘的現象！</p>
<p>三，今後之希望</p>
<p>現在漫畫果然是很風行，如其我們能够在思想和技巧方面痛下一番工夫，那末前途的希望眞是很大，如其老是思想幼稚而技巧一點没有經過訓練，胡亂地在報紙上發表，這足使讀者對於漫畫發生一種不良的印象，甚而至於厭惡！所以我們要與趣地培植這初長的樹苗，應當整飭漫畫的步伐，聳膚淺到深刻，從簡單到複雜，從獸慾到眞理，從個人到社會，在思想與技術方面切實研磨修鍊，糾正這個歪曲了的藝術而收到良好的結果，才不枉各同志的一番努力。</p>

<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>近來老聽見有許多　端相反的消息，同時並傳的。一個剛說，主持敎育者又奬勵起讀經書來了，所以皇清經解，十三經注疏等書籍，最近又行了時；一個却說，公文也要用白話了，至少也要用上些新式的標點與符號，前幾天，并且有一位在機關裏辦事的朋友，來同我以白話文的作法，和標點符號的用法。我就問以文言文是怎麽做的。他說：「文言的做法，是容易得很，譬如說公文罷，只敎幾個······等因奉此·······一來，將來文一抄，不怕是怎麽複雜的案卷，就一目瞭然了。」言下彷彿是在痛惜着這美妙的公文程式的將被革除的樣子。我就告訴他，可以不必悲觀，這公文程式，是怎麽也革不了的。因爲中國向來就是崇古的國家，秦始皇的時代，還并且要使儒者以吏爲師呢？</p>
<p>「可是現在是時勢不同了！」他又擔心着說。</p>
<p>我因爲無法可以除他的憂慮，不得已就只好想出了一個斯丹達Ｓtendhal來說：「請你放心，這一位法國的大作家，他做文章的時候，也還在模　着拿破嵛法興的用辭使句哩！」</p>
<p>白話文的提倡，到如今已經有十多年的歷史了，結果只向六言告示和等因奉此的公文上佔據了幾個標點與符號的地位，就有這一大批人的暴怒與不平，我眞不知封建制度的全部掃清，要在那一個年頭？</p>
<h3 id="c251">關於「雅片戰爭」 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 孫博</p>
<p>菊生先生讀了十月十七日的「自由談」所載的「東京觀怒吼記」一文以後，就在同月二十七日的「自由談」上指出了「高明先生的一個錯誤」，意思是：「雅片戰爭」乃是村山知義所作」，而高明先生却誤爲江口渙所作。但在十一月一日的「自由談」上，高明先生又在「抗議」，說是據我所知，雅片戰爭確係江口渙氏原作」。這麽一來，倒把我們這「寡聞」的讀者弄得眞的有點「莫明其妙」了。丨丨究竟雅片戰爭」是那一位的作品呢？村山乎？抑江口乎？</p>
<p>「據我所知」，在日本，以鴉片戰爭爲題材的戲劇有兩種：一爲江馬修的「阿片戰爭」，一爲村山知義的「最初的歐羅巴之旗」。而村山之作，實際上是跟江馬修之作很有點關係的。據村山在戲曲集最初的歐羅巴之旗」的序言上說，最初，因爲他對於江馬修之作殊不能滿意，所以，在築地劇圍上演該劇本於本鄉座時（一九二九年八月，由村山氏演出。裝置），他就徵得作者的同意，大加改作，而成了兩個人合作的東西；但，自從那次公演之後，他更不滿於那種混淆情形，於是他就索性把它全部改作，結果，「最初的歐羅巴之旗」，實際上已經完全跟「阿片戰爭」不同了。</p>
<p>依據以上的事實，我們就不難曉得：</p>
<p>第一，「阿片戰爭」的原作者，應該是江馬修，而不是江口渙（「據我所知」：江口氏的作品，大都爲小說，童話，絶少戲劇）。高明先生顯然把江馬修誤成江口渙了。　　第二，菊生先生指出「鴉片戰爭」乃村山氏所作，自然没有什麽錯處，因爲一最初的歐羅巴之旗」又名「阿片戰爭」。但，我覺得，在這種地方，於指出這事之後，還應該說明江馬修氏也曾作「阿片戰爭」這劇本。因爲由高明先生觀劇的時間（四五年前），地點（本鄉劇塲），和演出的劇團（築地劇團）推測起來，他所看到的「阿片戰爭」，顯然是江馬修氏和村山知義氏合作的台本：而實際上，當時的村山氏又不過是一個改作者，也許那劇本在那一次上演時還是獨用原作者江馬修的名字（跟江口渙這名字有一字相同的名字）也未可知。</p>
<p>以上就是「據我所知」的事實。非敢自炫「高明」，不過聊記所知而已。</p>

<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>幾個月前，在雜誌「無名文藝月刊」上，讀到了葉紫君的「豐收」，當時很想寫幾句話，因爲雜誌不久被人借去，一直就擱置下來。昨天，購得了一本新出的「文藝」，在裏面，又見到葉紫君的「豐收」的續稿「火一，急於想知道這一作家在幾個月内的新發展，首先就把它讀了。現在，依着篇末的附註，把兩篇連繫在一起，陳述一點意見吧。</p>
<p>關於「豐收」，因爲雜誌還在友人那裏，只能根據當時所寫下的綱要來說。這一篇小說，在當時，也可以說是一直到現在，深深的引起我的注意的，可說是那豐富的農村生活經騐。在一九三三所産生的幾篇描寫豐收成災的小說，在内容的充實上，大概是以這篇爲最了。作者對於農村生活，眞是熟習得很。雖然技術不很純熟，但在作者的筆鋒下，是有寫不完的生活的眞實擁擠在那裏，是誰都會感到的事。描寫農民，一定要作者眞實的了解農村生活，纔能有很好的成功；也祗有這樣，才會克服好内容空虚，專門用技巧來凑字數，甩　子的傾向；就由於此，對於這一作家，我覺得他的前途，是很廣大的。其次，使我對於這篇小說感到滿意的，是那一些豐收之前的關於豐收的歡樂的空氣的描寫。葉聖陶君的「多收了三五斗」是一樣的有　　　　　　　　　農民們没有知道穀價　甫的種種快　　　。可是　葉紫君寫得是更多一些，更切近農村一些，國此，反映得成災後的農村狀况，也更加悲慘。像這樣的技巧。從他所描寫的看，是没有一處不是基於眞實的農村生活，我覺得是很動人，很或功。</p>
<p>有這些優點，也有不少的缺點，第一，我想說的，是這一位作家的認識問題。就是在「豐災」裏，作者對於農村社會的機搆，還不能有深入的多方面的去　解，把一切的問題，寫得很單純，獨立的存在似的。第二，關於靑年的一代，暗寫當然是可以的，不遇暗到連蹟者捉不住一個明顯的輪廓時、這靑年一代給予讀者的印象，將是很淡漠的；僅就所寫的那樣瀅淡漠的情形去年，在子代工作的過程上，也没有合理的，一步一步的進展的去叙述。第三，就是在材料的取理上，是不很得當的。「豐收」是二萬字的小說，就它所收的材料看，是應該成爲一個四五萬字的中篇的，再發展，當然是可以成爲長篇。把這麽多的材料全擠在一個短篇内，必然是在各方面不記有充分的描寫，使讀者感到材料的擁擠，堆積。然而，儘管作者有這些缺點，是無防於這小說的存在，與它的優越處，，對業紫君，我表示了敬意。</p>
<p>也許是由於對葉紫君的希望過於熱烈吧，當我讀完了「火」以後，我覺得葉紫君在這篇小說上，是没有得到像「豐收」那樣的成功。這是「豐收」的續篇，描寫的就是前篇裏的暗寫的方面，和以後的發展。在有一些地方，我得到的印象，是和「豐收」恰恰相反。作者所要寫的主題，並没有充分的得到發展，不僅處處喪失了它的組織性，而且很多的地方抓不住重心。這從羣衆行動的描寫上，最後對被捕的人没有交代上，都可以看得出來。材料方面，要說「豐收」是擁擠堆積，那麽「火」，就是正相反很多段的内容是單調，空虚，缺乏眞實性。「豐災」裏描寫了農村的眞實，作者的態度也是嚴肅的，熱情的；而「火」，却不免在有一些地方，表示了不嚴肅的傾向，感情也没有那樣的眞摰。在這裏，我感到了葉紫君有很快的把自己深入的走向生活的必要。希望葉紫君往後有更好的作品出來。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>於是，他一面穿街過巷的東張西望着，一面想到那些確定我們行爲的原因是怎樣的輕微。三星期以來，他早就可以，並且早就應當下這樣的决心的，而它現在却無疑的是因爲他的弟弟得到了遺産才突然在他的心裡萌發起來。</p>
<p>他在那些懸有漂亮的房子或華麗的房子召租等字樣的門口停立下來，那些没有加上漂亮或華麗一類形容詞的招貼，他是不屑於一看的。他神氣十足地走了進去，估量着天花板的高低，在記事册上畫着房子的圖樣，記着各個房間是怎樣通貫的，和房子的出路等等。他告訴别人他是醫生，來看病的人狠多。樓梯要大而整潔才行；並且他的房子不能夠位置在三層樓以上。</p>
<p>他記下了七八個地址，並潦草地寫下了約兩百字的說明之後，跑回家去吃午飯，已經遲到了一刻鐘。</p>
<p>走進門，他就聽到了碟子的聲音。人家竟没有等他先吃起來了。這是什麽緣故呢？他們家襄吃飯的時間是從來不這樣準確的。他覺得有點難堪，不滿，因爲他原很敏感的。他剛進去，羅繭老爹便對他說：</p>
<p>「喂，筆爾，快點啦！你知道我們兩點鐘要到公證人那邊去的。今天不是閒逛的日子呢。」</p>
<p>醫生没有回答什麽，抱吻了他母親，並同父親和弟弟握了握手之後，便坐了下來；他在桌子中間吃空了的菜盆裏取出人家給他留下的那塊豬排。這豬排已經冷了，並且一點汁都没有。這一定是最壞的　塊。他心想人家儘可把這豬排留在竈衰等他回了再拿出來，儘可不必爲看第二個兒子，忙得昏頭昏腦，而把另一個兒子丨丨長子丨丨忘得乾乾凈凈。他進來時擾斷了的一家人的談話，這時又從原地方接續下去了。</p>
<p>如果是我呢，」羅蘭嬷嬷對哲安說，「我便會立刻這樣做：我住得非常濶氣，要能夠引起人家注意，我要和上流社會往來，我要騎馬，我要揀一兩件有興味的訴訟去辯護，在法院樹立聲譽。我要成爲一種稀有的，非職業的律師。天照應，你現在無須自已謀生了，而仍要有一種職業者，那不過爲的不白丢了你研究的結果。並且一個人，也不當什麽事都不做的。」</p>
<p>在削着一隻要梨子的羅麗蘭老爹說道：</p>
<p>「啊！如果我在你的地位，我要買一隻漂亮的船，一隻領港人用的小艇。我可以坐着這船一直到塞内加。」</p>
<p>現在輪到筆爾來發表他的意見了。據他的意思，總之，財産是不能增加一個男子的倫理的，理智的價格的。平凡的人有了錢祇會墮落，反之，勇邁的人有了錢却可以得到有力的帮助。但勇邁的人是不多見的。如果哲安眞是一個優越的男子，他現在旣無須謀生，便正可以把他的優越表現出來。可是他得有在其他任保况所不會有的百倍的努力。這並不是到法庭去辯護或駁擊寡婦與孤兒，及在不論勝負的一切訴訟上賺得許多錢，但在成爲一個卓越的法學家，法界之光。</p>
<p>他再補說兩句作爲結論：</p>
<p>「如果我有錢的話，我要解剖一些死屍！」</p>

<p>花生爲豆科植物之一，含滋養科極富。或謂其補益人身不亞於肉食：或謂其補肺潤腸，久食可以延年。故爲養生家所重視。惟多食生痰，乃爲美中不足耳。　　花生，落花生之簡稱，以其花落於地下沙中始結果實也。又以其仁似米之粒形，復似豆，連殼則宛如豆筴。故文曰花生米，花生豆也。或以其有滋養人身之功，乃曰長生果，連殼者曰花生，去殼之後曰花生仁也。</p>
<p>花生之種類亦多，我人常見者祇有大形與小形之别，小形者又分揀筴與非揀筴二種。其産區南北各省均有之。惟南方出産絶少，因氣候潮而土質多黏，不合於花生長也。如北方地土鬆燥，宜於種植，故易於滋生。最著名之産區爲山東河南兩省，山東産額夥而佳，河南稍遜一籌。山東沿海各縣比較爲多，例如泊兒，威海術，靑島，烟台，等更爲有名。</p>
<p>花生與生仁之銷路極路，因其可作小菜，和製糖果茶食，又爲消閑佳品，小兒恩　物。較大之去路，則爲油廠製油，卽爲花生油。簡稱生油，效用與頭油菜油相等。其在問業上尙有鉅額去路者，乃爲洋莊出口交易也。試稽之海關册歷年出口數字。可以證其爲我國農産中占有重要地位矣。洋莊出口揀遜高品，商品産區竹推山東泊兒，向有標準以大粒二十八粒秤見一兩者爲高品，三十二粒爲中級，三十四粒又低一級。　兒産品多爲高級，威海衛等已降一級，低次者　　　　　，故泊兒之花生仁及生油　價格，均比他埠　昻。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c278">喜新 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 亞珠</p>
<p>喜新厭舊是人的常情，因此可以假定人生的願望，只是一個「新」字。</p>
<p>普通一般人，是囿於古今世界中所有的事物的範圍之内，以自己個人爲標凖，認到從自己所無，以達到獲得，從自己所少的以達到增多，從自己所未經騐過的，以達到經騐過爲新。小孩子得到一塊糖糕，女人得到一件衣飾，一般人由月缺花殘而見到月圓花發、由春夏的温熱而感到秋冬的肅殺蕭條，均覺到「新」的景象。而發　或悲或喜的愉情。</p>
<p>唯另明一種，他對於目所能見，耳所能聞以及知道的事物，雖則自己不曾得到，也不會感覺怎樣的新奇。凡旣有的事物，和旣有的道理，都不能使他發生追求的興趣或熱情，他却不是厭世，他不過感到現世的浮淺。他受歷史的昭示，他總覺得世界上時時都可以加上美好的東西，時時也可以加深人生的意義。即是說：每時代都是可以加上些新的東西，使連續的人生，不至因呆板而感到没有趣味，而且他以爲這責任不能希望他人負担，只有感到現世浮淺的人，而想在現有世界中加上些新東西的人去辦理，喜新的人，他也不能擺脫這個責任。因此他人皆以現有世界爲滿足而不去創造，所以新東西，只好由能己的想望去創造。</p>
<p>一個人有新的熱望，新的創造，至至新的獲得，生活纔有趣味，老是在舊圈套裏生活，實際上無異在墳塋中安寢。無論自認爲好或不好的東西，總要加上些懷疑，因爲不好的當然要改換，好的東西，也没有絶對的限度，儘有更新的餘地。所以惟有由愛「新」而創造「新」的生活纔有意義。丨丨小防子最愛新物，故其生活最爲活躍。最富生氣。</p>
<p>人類之所以愛生命，對生命不會厭棄，便是智者自在改環境丨如科學家，哲學家，革命家。普通人則受環境變遷的迷惑，而反感自己生命的新奇，因而生眷戀之心。如一年四季氣候景色之不同，本身，壯，老之變化。宇宙間自然的變化，不會迷感智者，是爲不會變新的過制板生活的人給予新的刺戟。免得他厭倦，保障他的生活。智者在未有新的創造時，也可以在此得些新的安慰。</p>
<p>的的生命，是被「新的想望」這條繩子所牽引。貧困的人，他學到不能得新東西，或新生活的想望時，他便覺得痛苦而願自殺。所以困苦的人每喜花二角小洋，買一張山票。（廣東彩票非常旺盛。）便由彩票上，發生許多新的想望，因而忍耐的把生命留着。　　「新」的新家，可以說是人煩　化的　條。</p>

<p>你們支配是辦不到的；我有我的自由啦小　　　進　子在爸和媽面前爭自由，也</p>
<p>經不知多少回；因之而閙到父女間的感情破裂，媽流着涙暗裏給她錢呌她離開家庭的事也發生過。可，祗有一個星期，她又自動回了家。</p>
<p>「······請你放」百二十個心吧！我是會得離開這地獄似的家庭的，假如他們要把我送給某一個男人做洩慾器的話！」玲在寫給好的愛人的信裏，這話兒也已不知寫了多少遍；她又常常寫着：「我非爭得整個生活的完全自由不可！」</p>
<p>這樣子去堅那個跟她不同階級的戀人的心，以博得他更痴更熱的愛戀。</p>
<p>說玲没這個勇氣，那也不見得。這一回，在他訂婚的前夕，她瞞着父母去看那個以賣文章换飯吃的可憐的靑年，本來是偷了她媽的三百塊錢，預備送給他做旅費，送他離上海，免得眼見她跟别個男人訂婚，可是，「爲什麽一定要騙到我今天呢？」他苦笑地說了之後，她的心思立刻有了變異：「那是没有辦法的了！我還是愛着你，但你又没錢使我們兩個兒結婚，媽說，嫁丈夫總是嫁的，難道就做老處女嗎？我也想穿了，心一横，答允了他們把我任意送人吧！我們又没同居的希望啊！」愛人聽着就哭了起來，幾滴珍珠那麽大的眼淚就鼓動了她脫離家庭的勇氣，當晚就不回家，没有第三個人知道的他們兩個兒實行同居了。</p>
<p>三百塊錢在這末一個狂熱時期裏是會化得比三十塊錢還快的：她的頭上到脚上，還有身上的衣服，給他也做了一套新的西裝，以表示他們的新生活的開始；又是，晚上八點上了電影院，十一點半又迷醉在舞塲中的爵士音樂的聲時裏了；又是隨决吃喝；又是·······鈔票　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　兩個兒的狂熱的愛生活却還没感到滿足男的愛了起來，她也樂的精神不濟了。</p>
<p>「以後得有規例地生活了：兩個兒一天的生活費，一切在内，化一塊錢······」</p>
<p>「不行，不行！」她想：「我一天化一塊錢吃巧克力餅乾也慣了的，」可是，没說出口來。</p>
<p>就因爲没說出來，她心裏頭更覺得以後的生活的艱困悽慘了，而男的還無可奈何地哭訴着：「這在我已經是盡了我生生命力了丨你知道我的一塊錢是不容易得到的吧？」</p>
<p>想想：她要獲得一塊錢，所化的腦汁。比他一天喝的水還要多幾倍，她不由心頭亂跳起來。</p>
<p>實在，誰能夠使剛才吃過魚片飯的貓兒肯吃冷飯脚呢？愛的魔力威是是偉大的，可是習慣了的生活却是了不得的；她爲了愛跟他過了一個星期苦生活，再也耐不了，偉大的戀愛又没縛了她的脚鎖在他的心裏，終於他溜回了家去。　　離開了富裕的家多少日子，回來了對於富裕的家更覺得非常的適意了；正像那養惯在金絲籠裏的小鳥兒，飛出了籠子挨了幾天寒冷和飢餓回進了籠子，對於金絲籠裏的生活更感到了滿足。她竟有幾天把他差不多完全忘了地享受着富裕生活。</p>
<p>但，一天兩天，十多天過去了。她又得預備跟父母力爭自由去，她的富裕的物質生活使她的精神上受了異常的苦痛！這給母親探悉了，笑着說：「乖乖的，爸依舊充分地護着你，還不感激他嗎？要自由，要自由，回來幹嗎？」</p>
<p>她祗有忍着　去睡他一忽兒了。　　「是籠子裏遥鳥是過不了野外生活的，况且你是飛不出金絲籠的小鳥哩！　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　她讀着他來的信，再也忍不住的哭了。</p>

<p>— 土本</p>
<p>最近我們鎭上發生了一樁小小的騙案，損失的價值，雖祇百餘元，而騙子的思想新頴，騙術奇特，實開騙史上的新紀錄，足有一紀的價值。　　事實是這樣的；何ＸＸ是鎭上的富室，信譽頗隆。他家間壁有一所空屋，貼了召租，一天，來了一位上海口音的中年男子，說供職滬上ＸＸ肥皂公司，擬於鄉下雇屋一椽，推銷肥皂。屋子租定了以後，他又說只身來鄉，行李還没帶來，用十元錢做保證，向何暫借床帳被褥一付，何ＸＸ見他作事誠實，也就允許照辦。這樣住上了幾天，男子始終不出門外一步，所有吃的，也預付了五塊錢，包給了何家。人們見他起居飲食，都由何家供給，以爲他是何家的一個什麽親戚呢。幾天之後，他向何說，公司辦事人員，昨天來信，說不日售了貨品來鄉了，這兩天寂寞得很，自己一不歡喜賭博，二不歡喜冶游，所以極少消遣，感覺到非常煩悶，何ＸＸ見他這樣少年老誠，舉動温存，作事幹練，借物包飯，都先付了代價，於是極口讚美他一番，並相邀他到家裏來白相，以破寂寞。他到何家來白相，最憐愛何的五歲小孩，每次來了，必定帶了許多糖菓來，送給小孩吃，所以何家的小孩，見他來了，就很觀迎他，親近他，而要他相抱了。</p>
<p>一天他在何家，和小孩玩了一回，就帶了小孩，回到自己這邊來，說到家里去招好的玩具給小少爺玩，何家的人，都說他愛小囝，心中非常快活。隔了兩個鐘頭，鎭東ＸＸ綢緞局的夥友，突然跑到何家來，問何ＸＸ；「剛才貴賬房王先生，帶來的貨品，可中意麽？一何愕然，那里來的賬房王先生，自己並不派人去拿綢緞，急問夥友；「你說的，究竟什麽一回事？」那夥友聽了，心中也有些不解了，好好的他們賬房先生，帶了小少爺，來取東西，爲什麽他東家還不知道？於是急心說道；「在十二點鐘時候，我們店裏，來了一位男子，說是這裏的賬房王先生，手裏還抱了你們小少爺，說太太要採辦衣料，當即揀選了價貴的綢緞四疋，約值一百五十餘元，說携回去請太太親自選擇，我們見他抱了小少爺來，當然信任他是這裏的賬房，小少爺是我們認得的，况且他臨走說拿了貨，不好抱小少爺了，把小少爺留在我們店裏，囑爲好好地看護，他去去就來，後來老等他不來，所以經理派我來探問的，但是這裏千金寳貴的小少爺，在他手裏抱着，分明是這裏的賬房無疑了，難道他是騙子不成？那倒奇怪了！小少爺又什麽在他手裏呢？」何ＸＸ聽了，不由的「呀！」的呌了出來，連喊：「反了，反了，天下竟有這樣新奇的騙子？」當把騙子租屋起始的經過情形，告訴了夥友，並自認晦氣，承認賠償損失。囑夥友去把小孩抱了回來。夥友聽也，愕然驚駭不止。</p>
<h3 id="c281">上海减色了 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 國殊</p>
<p>秋是肅殺可怕的季候。尖冷的秋風，誰都曉得比不上春風的温和可愛。而且由初秋而秋中而深秋，這中國，寒暑表只向下降着。充滿了肉香的大上海，也就隨之大大的減色了。</p>
<p>鐵一般的事實，證明了我們在都市裏的女，丨是資産階級的小姐姨太太們。洗起鍋來無米煑的下等人，當然不在此範圍之内。丨已經深深地歐化得很有些程度了。朝見夕效，只要新奇特異的，合乎尊意的，什麽都可以幹出來。以衣服言：花樣翻新，五光十色，簡直令人眼花撩亂，嘆觀止矣丨似乎不如此，不足以顯其濶；不如此，不足以顯其媚；不如此，不足以顯其榮耀，因此，話就有了。</p>
<p>上海上女人的世界，女人是上海的權威，没有了她們撑塲面，根本就不會這樣人閙熱。一到暑天，更是她們大活躍面特洛躍的時候：臂也袒，胸也露；整個的玉腿一絲不穿的會使人聯想到······兩個最惹人注意的小饅頭若隱若現的躺在薄薄的輕紗裏面動搖着，動搖着；豐滿的臀部，跑起路來，有節奏似地一扭一擺；膚色白而且柔嫩，一切曲線美肉感得眞要迷死了。人道學先生們看見了，至少要七竅生烟，大呌「反了」的！但這究竟是近代都市文明的特色，這是民族精神的表現，這是她們特殊的權利：可惜秋風送暑，天氣陡的變了！用不着說，她們也自然的變了，除了蓬鬆卷曲的頭髮，美麗的臉孔外，其他能「引人入勝」的中下截各部份，就完全給一九三三年的時裝艶服掩没了去。在這</p>
<h3 id="c282">。······然後　拿一些甜的味道給你嘗士英？。 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>情形之下，人們恭而敬之的「注目禮」，一時失了對象，許是會感到生命的空虚吧？過慣了這樣輕快生活的女人們，精神上也許會有些不大寫意的吧？</p>
<p>秋深了，規規矩矩的說，大上海减了色，是千眞萬確的事實。但是减色是暫時的，並不是永久的現象。明年的署天，不又是她們揚眉吐氣的出來扮演各式各樣的活劇而「犧牲色相」的風頭日麽？到那時，我們「復興農村」的計劃，或者「尙未成功」；而大上海的「色」，不但凖是無問題的恢復了目下的「减」，突飛猛進，亦意中事耳。</p>

<p>— 時安</p>
<p>假使中國短衫同志比長衫同志多，那末，國家也不致這樣糟糕了。因爲短衫同志個個能替社會生産，長衫同志究竟消費的多。</p>
<p>在「滴答」一秒鐘，也會喪失你整個的生命，在這個萬惡淵藪的社會裏。　　要人們說話，猶之平老太婆倡出海經，如果你去聽它，包要失望。</p>
<p>有快樂便有煩惱，有煩惱便有痛苦　　富人比貧人容易墮落，因爲他們只有向下的决志，没有向上的精神。</p>
<p>娼妓不一定個個自廿墮落，大多數還是環境驅使她下流，社會驅使她滅亡　　從艱苦中得到的成功，是眞實的，從虚僞中得到的成功，是僥倖的，因爲前者是精神鑄成的，後者是金錢買來的　　我們應該去支配金錢，不好給金錢來支配我們。</p>
<p>男人爲要博得女人的歡心，往往不惜墮落自己的人格丨甚至因此不惜喪失一切，你看丨游藝塲上的游客，跳舞廳裏的舞客，大多數不正如此嗎？</p>
<p>有人說：「店家爲什麽要用女招待呢？」我說：「她是生財之寳啊！」</p>
<p>幸福的時候，應該想想從前受痛苦的情形。受痛苦的時候，應該憧憬將來幸福的到臨。</p>
<p>人說：「女人是男人的玩物，」我說：「男人何嘗不是女人的玩物呢？」不然的話，男人怎麽要討好女人。</p>
<p>闔第光臨的請酒帖，鼎惠懇辭的訃聞，都是討錢的揭單。</p>
<p>公子哥兒，摩登女郎，不過是一種社會的點綴品。也許社會不需要他們存在。</p>

<p>編者按：在這種不景氣的年頭，余君的親戚，能不爲守財奴，肯拿出積蓄</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>來，創辦工廠；雖說他的動機，完全在乎營利，但多少對於民生問題，有相當的貢獻。這件事對於余君的前途，有直接關係，應當盡力幹去；牠並且對於社會，也有相當關係，應當得到各方面的贊助。現在且把余君提出來的問題，逐條答復如下：</p>
<p>（一）我國是一個生産落後的國家，什麽工業都不發達；你看無論吃的住的穿的用的，貴至幾十萬元幾百萬元一架的飛機，賤至一個銅元幾只的鐵釘，無不仰仗舶來品的供給。所以我國可以說是一個工業的荒地，只要你肯盡心竭力的去幹，做出來的東西，能夠不亞於洋貨，那末任何工業，都有發達的希望。余君祗須詔定一種你令親的資力，可以趕得到，同時你自己的能力可以吃得光（滬諺意卽勝任也）的一種，着手去凖備好了。</p>
<p>（二）第二個問題，據我們所知，是不爲任何工廠所歡迎的。除非你有相當奥援，十九是不能成功的。本埠小西門外陸家浜，中華職業學校，自本學期起，前天晚上，開辦一班機械科補習班，對於　　　情形，或許是很相當的。我們以爲在余君這種環境之下，大可以將四天的職務辭去，直捷爽快地到工廠裏去實習；到得晚上，再到補習學校去求須書本上有系統的學識。雖說做工的所得，不能像現在的豐富，但是你的進步，也就計日可待了！</p>
<p>（三）至於第三個問題、不妨去試試···好在不生效力，也没有損失的。</p>

<h3 id="c289">怎樣來培植我們這位小妹妹 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 俞人偉</p>
<p>有人說：「二十世紀文化的結晶，可以在冰淇淋和電影上求之」。的確，冰淇淋是溽署時候人們的唯一恩物，和冰淇淋有同樣作用而爲近代人民所稱道的，厥爲生氣蓬勃的電影。嘗聞電影乃藝術界的小妹妹，年紀雖輕，而聰慧絶倫：她的姊妹藝術如戲劇，音樂，繪畫等類，發源都地數千年前以上，只有這位小妹妹丨電影，可算是十九世紀後期的産物。照現在世界各國情形而論，電影雖然是後來居上，但是，前途的危險，却有使人怵目驚心者。</p>
<p>别的慢說，且看號稱執世界影業牛耳的好萊塢，自聲片發明以還，一方面受着經濟影響的摧殘，不得不消極地裁員减薪，拚命的在量與質的方面撙節；一方面是劇作者和導演者的没落，把無聊的内容，迎合低級觀衆的興趣。所以現在的出品，較諸一九三○年以前無聲影片的黄金時代眞是使人意外的失望。但是問題就是這樣地發生：拿什麽方法來挽回這個危局呢？</p>
<p>在現代社會思想極盛的潮流裏，我們所要求的電影，當然是平民化的電影。然而平民化的電影作品，稍一不愼，就要流爲塡補低級趣味的消遣品，而失掉眞正藝術品的固有的性質；因爲一般趣味的墮落性，是這樣地廣大，所以美國片都是千篇一律勉强地製造出來，迎合這一種下劣趣味，所以現在電影界，首先應該覺悟的，就是應當使這一種下劣趣味，轉變過來；同時也應當負着「敎育電影」的責任，來領導社會上一般人的趣味，使一步一步地提高上去；因此電影的製作者，應當於打算金錢之外，更得有愛好藝術的靈心，把所導演的片子裏的那種低劣挑撥的場面，儘量地减少下去，以至於「烏有」的境地，那麽，就可達到提高一般興趣的目的了。</p>
<p>中國的電影，還是在萌芽時代的技巧上，怖景上，設備上，當然都還趧不上西洋的那麽宏偉周密；但是現在，我們所需要的，并不是這些外表上的壯觀，而是現實的人生問題，和社會中心問題。近來在本刊上有沙基君的幾篇「中國電影藝人訪問記」的記述，内有幾位導演先生所說的話，都很中肯我希望他們都能像他們所說的努力的去做。在這裏，我還要供獻一點意見：就是我們應當拿藝術的甘露，來灌溉這朶含苞的蓓蕾；我上文不是說過，電影豈不是頂小的一位小妹妹麽？那麽，我很希望中國小妹妹，不要像外國小妹妹一樣　貴族化，我們是要把高深的，化爲淺近的，呆板的，化爲靈活的，無味的，化爲有趣的；然而平民化，並不是粗俗化，淺近化，决不是單調化，靈活化，並不是專彈滑調，有趣化，决不是單演没有意味的滑稽。總之我們要立在藝兩的立場上，來培植我們這位年輕的小妹妹。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c290">替「晨曦」說幾句話 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 孫瑜</p>
<p>昨天，吉星公司的「晨曦」在本埠開映的頭一天，我冐着小雨到了北京大戲院。這一部所謂「小公司」出品「晨曦」給了我許多很好的感想。當我今天早晨（十一月六日）讀了各報的許多過於苛刻的批評，以後我很願意替它說幾句話，尤其是對於今日申報電影專刊署名「瑜」的「評晨曦」的各點，略有一點不同的意見。（是日之「瑜」，並非孫瑜。編者註）　　關於佈景，攝影各方面的平凡劣拙，和導演方面因爲時間逼迫而造成的疎忽各點，我認爲作影評者應該儘量地予以指平，同時也應該實際地體騐經濟比較缺乏的小公司的困難，對於製片人的忠實的努力，予以同情的鼓勵。</p>
<p>「晨曦」拿黄村農工的抗敵反帝做題材，影射着東北冒死抗日的義勇軍或暗中帮助義通軍的農民和工人。雖然在片終時只於打死了二三十個敵人而大呼勝利，失去了反帝的嚴重性，但是本片反帝的熱情，抗敵的血氣，是值得向許多頽廢的國人灌注的。</p>
<p>我覺得「晨曦」的製作者並没有把戀愛寫得高於一切。片中的抗敵首領何三保並不是因爲阿薇而纔組織起衆人去抗敵的。片裏的阿祥，雖然追求着阿薇的愛，但是當他舉起槍口希圖暗殺他的情敵的時候，他覺悟了轉變了。他的抗敵雖然是受了愛的驅使，但他的轉變刦並「鐵板紅淚錄」中之兩王，（王瑩王徵信）導演赌洪深。</p>
<p>新光大戲院十二日放映</p>
<p>不是爲求得阿薇的愛而是顧念着衆人奉爲誓言的「精誠團結」幾句號令。這是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>「晨曦」對於抗敵首領何三保，無疑地是描寫得太像一個理想的英雄了。但我們不能否認要組織起農民或礦工來抗敵反帝，領導和指揮一切的人才是必需的。在「晨曦」裏我們也看見了彈藥完了而仍要抵抗的羣衆，但「晨曦」的製片者不應把光榮的勝利表現得太容易了；應該再嚴重一點，再擴大一點，對於各礦工自動起來抵抗的需要和行動，更有切實的表現。</p>
<h3 id="c291">評「晨曦」 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 綠决</p>
<p>不消說，這張「晨曦」又是隨着轉變的狂潮而産生的作品。主題和「血路」相差不多。兩張片子都是由戀愛引到抗敵上去，但都是很不自然。不過，這種嚴重的現實題材被找住是可喜的。</p>
<p>「晨曦」的開頭是寫阿祥，阿薇，何三保的三角戀愛，畫面上的黄村是充滿着融和，舒適的空氣，故事的中途突然揷進了敵人的襲擊，但劇情的發展太生硬了。可笑的是幾十個拿着土鎗，彈藥已盡的農民，居然會把敵人的軍隊殲滅。顯然這種故事都是经幻想出來的。</p>
<p>劇中的阿祥是一個貪生怕死的弱者，一刻也不能忘記女人。而何三保是一個勇敢，能幹的靑年。結果何三保被阿薇所愛，阿祥終於死去。這個强有力的對照是顯出懦弱者的没落和勇敢者的勝利。這個暗示是值得鑽美的。但演出是失敗的，尤其是幾個戰爭的塲面。幾十條士鎗和敵人對敵，彈藥盡了甚王拿飯鍋釘鞋來當子彈，這是多麽令人可笑啊！</p>
<p>還有，「明鎗」和「暗箭」的應用也甚笨拙，一個舉鎗欲殺情敵的人還顧得這種信條嗎？而且，「只准明鎗交戰，不許暗箭傷人」也太古俠十風了阿薇遇巨獸逃上樹時明明穿着黑短褲赤脚，而巨獸在樹邊的鏡頭露出阿薇的褲脚却變了白褲脚白鞋，這是借用外片的不小心。</p>
<p>寅員王飛娟餘了有幾處地方舉動太都市化了之外，表情尙可。張雨亭誠如劇情所支配，表演得像一個不凡的英雄。王春元和其他演員都没有特出的地方。</p>
<h3 id="c292">「離恨天」觀後 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>師長的女兒愛上了一個馬弁。這也許是從偏僻的理想中發生了這一類畸形的故事。有人家的小姐愛上了車夫或馬夫之類，但是怎樣發生的呢？師長的女兒旣有了做參謀的一個對手，却仍舊去戀戀於馬夫，事實上這種劇材的結構太虚渺了，成了這個莫明其土地堂的脫離處，成絶大的缺點。</p>
<p>故事上巳造成了絶大的差誤，當然導演者是不容易討好的了。有許多地方，爲了經濟的不寛裕，規模的不完備和環境上的限制以至於有欠缺之處，那是我們須要原宥的。然而以一堂堂師長，身邊的自衛一定很周秘的，何以輕易被一個馬夫殺死？這種缺點，决不能說他是小公司而加以原諒了。</p>
<p>演員中陸福曜太做作。錢似鶯也勉强。其他没有什麽可說的。總而言之，這一類的影片事實上不能認爲適合於時代的。至於哀感頑艶，亦未見得說得上　　但是小公司的經濟和環境，是極困難的。當然與雷門諾伐羅的「離恨天」不能相提並論的，最後希望這種不適合時代的村料應少用些。</p>

<p>由「狂流」「滿江紅」而「春羣」之導演程步高，最近自編一「同仇」劇本，用北方鐵路做背景，以戀愛事件爲穿揷，由嚴月閒王瑩主演。據說此片係程步高從「滿江紅」和「春蠶」兩片中所得敎訓而編成的。各方面都能合於大衆化的原則。</p>

<p>— 馬騰</p>
<p>馬克斯果然進來了，後面還跟著那位製片家史登吉爾。馬克斯替他們二人介紹了。史登吉爾是一個面容和藹的中年男子，頭髮已經有些花白了，但是兩眼烱烱有光，確是一個多才多藝的人。勞萊雷瑙德的酒意已經漸漸地醒了。他但覺得他是偉大的勞萊雷瑙德，而對方不過是個渺小的製片商人。馬克斯是旁觀者清，他着了勞萊的秋氣，心裏難過得很，想要勸告他，但是勞萊一些不聽他的話。他滔滔不絶地談天說地，弄得史登吉爾莫名其妙。後來談到了本題，他亦是獨自一個人大吹大擂，不讓史登吉爾講一句話。他告訴史登吉爾，說他是勞萊雷瑙德，他的名字，就可以賣錢。他說不願意做個英國人的配角；倘使史登吉爾要請他加入的話，那個角色一定還要加重地位，他的薪水是每星期八千美金；要是在無聲片時代，他至少可以得一萬。他又對史登吉爾說：「你不要以爲這是你帮我的忙······誰要在你那糟片子理當一個小角色······還是我帮你的忙！」史登吉爾聽也，立了起來道：「時間太晚了，恐怕耽誤你的晚飯。」他告辭了。馬克斯挽留著史登吉爾，說勞萊的話是不算數的。勞萊道：「我的話怎麽不算數的？我不希罕史登吉爾的片子。我還是一個赫赫的大明星，一些都不改樣！」史登吉爾道：「好了，雷瑙德先生，再會吧。」馬克斯還想拉住他，可是史登吉爾道：「好了，我們胆天再吧。」</p>
<p>馬克斯等史登吉爾走了之後，回過頭來對着雷瑙德道：「你這個醉鬼！」雷瑙德道：「給我滾出去！」馬克斯當然雖好滾出去，但是在臨走之前，他對雷瑙德道：「不知道費了多少氣力帮你的忙，從來没有爲第二個人這樣賣過力氣；不過現在，我都不提了，亦不再怪你了，因爲······我太爲你擔憂了！」雷瑙德道：「笑話！你爲我担什麽憂？」馬克斯道：「我無論走到什麽地位方，人家都恥笑我，替我起了一個諢號，呌做「看墳的馬克西。」無論什麽戲院，我都走到了，到處爲你碰釘子。昨天我還打了一個電報到好萊塢。我明廳得是不中用的，但是我亦打了。好了，這是一個回電！」他將那電報向雷瑙德身上一擲，那電報落在地上。雷瑙德道：「我不要看，那是你用來嚇我的。」馬克斯平心靜氣的向他說道：「我告訴我實話罷。</p>
<p>你是完結的了。你從來亦没有做過眞正的演員，不過因爲你扮相好丨但是現在扮相亦不興了。你自己拿鏡照照丨你那眼皮都墜了下來了丨活像一個老太婆。你是完結了，無論是電影，舞台，無線電，雜要，無論什麽，都没有你的份了。去吧！鑽到墳墓襄去吧！」（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) This morning at 10:00 AM, Okamura attended a tea party at the Foreign Ministry building. Huang Fu and He Yingqin were both present. A formal discussion was held on unresolved matters in the war zone. Regarding the issue of receiving various passes of the Great Wall, a method has been agreed upon. Once our side is ready, the official handover can take place. Issues such as the establishment of customs and postal services at each pass have also been largely agreed upon. However, detailed rules still require ongoing negotiations between both sides. The meeting concluded at around 11:00 AM. Afterwards, Okamura told reporters that everything was no longer a problem. After this morning's meeting, the results were satisfactory and there was no need for further discussion. I plan to visit Beihai Park and the Summer Palace this afternoon, and will attend a banquet hosted by He at Jurentang in the evening. (7th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin is scheduled to inspect the troops stationed in Liulihe, Yang Zhengzhi and Miao Zhengliu's units, along the Pinghan Line tomorrow morning. He is scheduled to transfer to the Pingsui Line in two days to inspect Zhang Tingchu and Sun Duoquan's units stationed in Huailai and Kangzhuang, etc. The inspection is expected to be completed within a week.

<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun returned to Zhangjiakou this afternoon. He told reporters at the station that he was inspecting the training of district chiefs in the provincial government for a month, and he rushed back to inspect before the deadline. Whether he will go to Suiyuan will be determined after returning to Chahar. If Huang Fu sends another telegram inviting him, he will go to visit him. Song Zheyuan is in Tianjin receiving treatment for a back problem, and the results are very good. He can return to Beiping and Chahar in about ten days. The conflict between Tang and Liu's troops is still in a tug-of-war. According to Liu's telegram, most of Tang's army has been resolved, and more than a dozen cannons have been captured. The remnants have mostly fled east to Longguan and Chicheng. However, according to another report, a cavalry unit of Tang's army has bypassed Chicheng Longguan and taken a large encirclement shape against Liu's army. The truth is unclear. After I arrive in Zhangjiakou, I plan to send someone to the front to investigate in order to mediate. (7th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Tanggu Telegram: Negotiations on the Beiping-Shenyang through train issue are gradually maturing. Detailed arrangements will be discussed after the commissioner from the Ministry of Railways arrives in Beiping. It is expected to be realized by the end of the month. Major stations along the Beining Railway have been ordered to prepare everything. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong will be responsible for the Beiping-Fengtian through train issue, and will directly negotiate with the Japanese side and Kan Duo, the director of the pseudo-Fengshan Railway Bureau. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Mengyu said that the Beining Railway has been cut off since the September 18th Incident two years ago. Although it can now run from Beiping to Shanhaiguan, due to the relationship with the Japanese-controlled Fengshan Railway, it has not been able to reach beyond the pass, causing difficulties for travelers and commerce. Now, the newly appointed Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Yin Tong, has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese and the puppets, and the railway bureau has decided on the principle of allowing through traffic without losing rights. The current principle is that the Japanese and puppets are not allowed to use the name of the Fengshan Railway to run trains into the pass, and to sever financial and official document exchanges with the Japanese and puppets. Once both sides agree, they will sign and allow through traffic to outside the pass, directly from Beiping to Liaoning. (7th dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Promotion of Inner Mongolian Autonomy Should be Led by the Central Government. Huang Shaoxiong Telegraphed this Idea to Prince De.

<p>Guihua: Wu Xixian, Prince De's representative, left Suiyuan in the morning of the 6th to return to Bailing Temple to report on the meeting with Huang. Huang had a personal letter delivered to Wu to be forwarded to Prince De, advising the representatives to promote Mongolian autonomy under the leadership of the central government and the provincial government, and to discuss everything with Li Songfeng nearby. Huang also sent Yang Wenzhao, a section chief of the Ministry of Interior, to Bailing Temple to inspect the local situation and return on the 7th. Lin Jingzhong, a counselor of the National Government, and Wang Wenyu, a teacher at the Central Military Academy, arrived in Suiyuan from Beijing at Huang's invitation, and are scheduled to go to Bailing Temple in the coming days to assist Songfeng and others in investigating the situation in Inner Mongolia and conduct on-site research on border issues. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guihua: Huang Shaoxiong, Zhao Pi'lian, and Xu Tingyao are scheduled to go to Bailing Temple within two to three days. Huang said that the central government's plan for handling Mongolian affairs will not change. This time, due to the welcome telegrams from various princes, he has requested that cars be sent to Suiyuan, and he will go to Bailing Temple in two to three days to discuss the preliminary methods for handling Mongolian affairs with the princes, based on the principles stipulated by the central government. Rumors of a meeting in Bailing Temple are inaccurate. I will not stay in the temple for long and will return to Suiyuan and then to Beijing, without going to Shanxi Province. The practical issues of reforming Mongolian administration are being collected, and I am determined to start with research, but this matter cannot be done in the short term. Lin Jing and Wang Wenyu went to Bailing Temple on the morning of the 7th. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guihua: The Panchen Lama will go to Beijing. Due to the weather turning cold and the inconvenience of traveling, it may be postponed until next spring. The Panchen is still chanting sutras near Bailing Temple, and will go to the temple in the coming days to meet Huang and Zhao. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since Huang and Zhao went to Suiyuan to discuss the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, negotiations have been underway in recent days. It is reported that the two issues that have not yet been resolved are the organization of the autonomous government and the autonomous region. The central government has formulated a principle, which Huang will discuss with the Mongolian princes, advising them to handle matters within this principle. However, the princes on the Mongolian side have different opinions, which can be roughly divided into: (1) The active faction, which advocates active engagement; (2) The moderate faction, which advocates that autonomous matters can be handled gradually, step by step; (3) The passive faction, which is unwilling to get involved in various matters. Because the opinions of the princes are inconsistent, a concrete solution has not yet been reached. Huang is currently in contact with representatives of Prince De, etc. If the autonomy matter is in line with the central government's principles, then Huang will be able to go to Bailing Temple in the coming days. (7th dispatch) (Beiping) Zhangjia sent his representatives Gong Ziwan to Bailing Temple and Li Shoushan to Ximeng and other places to arrange everything in preparation for entering Mongolia for propaganda. The date of Zhang's departure must be determined after Gong and Li return to Beiping. Li is currently traveling from Ximeng to Bailing Temple. There is no news of when he will return to Beiping, so Zhang's entry into Mongolia is still indefinite. (7th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The issue of Sun's army moving west is being strongly opposed by the Northwest authorities due to its excessive number of personnel. They have stated that Sun's army must be downsized by half before it can be allowed to advance westward. At the same time, about two brigades of troops from Ningxia and Qinghai are preventing Sun's army from crossing the river near Shizuizi. Therefore, it will be difficult for Sun's army to advance westward unless it is downsized. In order to appease the people of Ningxia, the authorities are preparing to order General Sun to reduce the size of his troops appropriately, to seek explanation from the central government to the Northwest authorities, and to ask Ge Jingen to discuss with Yan Xishan in Shanxi, asking him to allow Sun's army to temporarily stay in Suiyuan for the winter, and then plan for departure next spring. Ge and Yan are currently discussing the matter. (7th dispatch)</p>

Premier Wang was away at his official residence, so Peng Xuepei received them as a representative. Qi and others stated their intentions, requesting the central government to withdraw its order and stop Sun Dianying's troops from moving westward. Peng replied that the central government had already allocated 300,000 yuan to allow Sun to spend the winter in Wuyuan. (7th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Changli: Chairman Yu specially rewarded each security team policeman with one yuan for their courageous recovery of Funing City, as an encouragement. Furthermore, after the bandits fled Funing City, there were still more than a thousand of them, causing continuous looting along the way, causing many after effects that are of great concern. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changli: Regarding the Japanese demand for our police team to leave Funing City, Zhang Xiguang telegraphed Chairman Yu for instructions on the 7th. It is heard that this matter will be included in the scope of Okamura's discussions with Chairman Huang. The Japanese staff still limited us to reply before the 10th. (7th dispatch) (Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters on the 7th that although Funing City has been recovered, most of the bandits have fled north to the Taitouying area, and their strength has not been reduced. There is still a risk of counterattack. Once the troops have been slightly reorganized, elite troops will be deployed to pursue and eliminate them in order to clear the source of the chaos. Regarding all post-war affairs in the county, there are many things to be dealt with. Once local order is restored, they will be carried out in order. As for post-war relief, the first priority is to replenish the people's clothing and food. It is decided to use the financial resources of this province to provide relief as soon as possible. At present, the War Zone Relief Committee and various charitable organizations in this city have begun preparations. As for the security team that besieged Funing City this time, the northern side was the Liu Zuozhou unit under Li Jichun. When the shelling was fierce, the bandits broke out from the north gate, so they did not suffer great damage. After Funing City was captured, the Japanese Endo suddenly suggested to Zhang Xiguang that the security team be withdrawn to its original defense, leaving only Liu Zuozhou's unit stationed there. However, if the bandits counterattack again, Liu's unit is weak and will not be able to resist, and Funing City will be in danger of falling again. Therefore, Zhang did not dare to act without authorization and asked me for instructions. I also believe that the matter is important, and I have telegraphed Chairman Huang and He for instructions. It is heard that this kind of request from the Japanese side is Endo's personal opinion, and it seems that it can be easily resolved. (7th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There is a saying that the pseudo-county magistrate of Funing, Zuoguoxin, was shot dead by the security team. Lao Haozi secretly went to Qinhuangdao to take refuge temporarily.

At 10:00 AM, they arrived at the sea off Dagu. According to reports from the local navy, two ships were spotted on the sea this morning, but it is unknown whether they were the ships Luo was on. Fan sent someone to use wireless radio to call out to the sea, but they failed to connect. Fan and others returned to Tanggu at 10:30 AM. According to customs estimates, the reason why the ship failed to arrive may have been due to sea winds. Now that the hurricane has stopped, there may be definite news this afternoon.

<h3 id="e18">The Severity of Banditry in Sichuan <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>—·Ming</p>
<p>The distorted politics of Sichuan are truly rare throughout the country. Land tax is paid almost monthly. Excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies are added on top of each other. Furthermore, with the turmoil of bandits and the intense infighting, the once prosperous land has recently turned into ruins. In general, the social situation in Sichuan Province is different from the newly opened areas in the Northeast. Large landowners with more than 10,000 acres of land are not common, except for the Tusi on the Sichuan border. Most of those engaged in agriculture are owner-farmers. Large tenant farmers also have farming tools and considerable capital. Today, those who are most deeply exploited and suffer the most from military trampling are mostly this type of small-property farmers. As a result of layer upon layer of exploitation, owner-farmers have become impoverished. The act of abandoning land and fleeing from famine has gradually appeared in Sichuan. Those who were originally poor farmers, or those who did not have enough land to support themselves, or small farmers who relied on side businesses, have no other way out except to flee to other places and become desperados, or join the ranks.</p>
<p>Logically, the Sichuan army should have a surplus in income and should not be in arrears with pay. However, the salaries of lower-level non-commissioned officers and soldiers are often in arrears for three to five months or more. As a result, the army is extremely impoverished and the people are becoming more and more exhausted. The six major military giants in Sichuan each occupy one side, resembling the emperors of the old days. Their tyranny and ignorance may even exceed them. Chengdu was originally the capital of Sichuan and the center of cultural heritage, as well as a gathering area for handicrafts. However, in recent years, due to the stationing of various armies, the power within the city walls is not even unified. A person who kills or sets fire only needs to cross a certain boundary to receive special protection, just like a political prisoner in a foreign country. Otherwise, they can be safely released with a business card from a senior military leader. There is no way to punish even the most heinous criminals. Thus, the law is ineffective and the military is all-powerful. The order in Chongqing seems to be better than Chengdu on the surface. The degree of exploitation is also shallower than in southwestern Sichuan. However, bandit suppression donations and patriotic donations are the same. The ferocity of guards and soldiers fills the streets and markets at all times and in all places. The people are resentful and have nowhere to vent. As a result, the four borders are restless and the Red bandits are able to invade Sichuan with a few thousand defeated infantrymen, attacking cities and seizing land. Recently, they have disrupted the counties of Tongnan, Ba, and even attacked Xuanhan, Taiping, and Chengkou, and even raided Suiyuan and Qu County, causing shock in Lower East Sichuan and unrest in Wanxian.</p>
<p>It is well known that Sichuan Province has many soldiers. It is also well known that Sichuan Province has many civil wars. Is it not enough to suppress mere bandits? But the disaster has spread so widely. There is no other reason. It is the mutual suspicion between the various armies and the lack of determination to advance and suppress. And one</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Ye Suzhong, Executive Committee Member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, returned to Hangzhou after inspecting the Quzhou defense area and the Yushan, Kaihua, and Guangfeng bandit areas. According to his account, the bandit army treats new recruits harshly. According to the order issued by the false Front General Headquarters, each new recruit receives one yuan, plus two jiao for straw sandal expenses. Those not hired from the Soviet area can receive more initially, but at most, no more than three jiao per day. Furthermore, each independent battalion at the front receives one jiao and five fen per person per day for food. Guerrilla units that have abandoned production receive five fen each for oil and salt expenses. Units in the rear receive one jiao per person per day for food. Therefore, soldiers often go hungry every day. Also, the methods of raising funds in the bandit area include "hitting local tyrants and posting notes," which means writing down the amount and setting a deadline for payment, as well as kidnapping, borrowing goods, and borrowing rice campaigns. The false central government is now trying to centralize cash and collect women's jewelry to issue non-convertible military notes. Recently, they issued 3 million in public bonds, and each county in the bandit area is required to subscribe 150,000, so cash is completely squeezed out. In addition, internal killings and suspicions frequently lead to internal strife. Recently, our army's encirclement and suppression have been successful, and the future is optimistic.

<p>(Nanjing) The long-discussed issue of levying import duties on foreign rice has been passed by the Legislative Yuan. It was rumored that it would be implemented on New Year's Day next year, and then it was rumored that the tax would be levied starting December 1st. However, according to those responsible in the Ministry of Finance, the foreign rice tax is indeed in line with the government's goal of revitalizing rural areas, but the scope of this matter is quite broad and has significant relationships with tariffs and diplomacy. It must be handled carefully beforehand to avoid obstacles after implementation. Therefore, the implementation date is still difficult to determine. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan convene another meeting of various ministries to discuss and agree on the implementation date. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior believes that the period of political tutelage is about to expire, so actions must be taken.</p>
<p>First. Regarding the various armies in Sichuan Province, Liu Xiang's troops are the strongest in terms of current strength. Among the various armies, Liu Xiang also has a relatively upward development trend. However, politically, there is too little construction, and economically, there are no solutions, so that even the existing handicraft industry is in dire straits. The countryside is even worse. The people cannot cooperate with the various armies, so gaps arise, which are exploited by the evil forces. Other armies, such as Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and even Yang Sen and Liu Wenhui, are inferior to Liu Xiang. This is the first difficulty in suppressing bandits in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Second. Although the trend of unification in Sichuan is gradually being completed, the suspicions and attempts to dominate each area remain the same among the various armies. The desire to preserve their own survival and strength is greater, while concern for the people decreases daily. Therefore, when bandits are in northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan stands idly by. When bandits attack Liu Cunhou, Tian Songyao and Liu Wenhui observe from the sidelines, intending to allow the bandit army to destroy Liu's troops and weaken one of the enemy's forces. Therefore, during Liu Cunhou's defeat, the other armies all adopted a cold attitude, with the illusion of reaping the benefits. This is the second difficulty in suppressing bandits in Sichuan.</p>
<p>With these two factors, even without bandit disturbances, a major change will be unavoidable. In this time of internal and external troubles and popular unrest, the breakdown of social order is a constant threat. How much more so when agitation is added? Therefore, for the sake of good aftermath, the central government must, on the one hand, give local warlords practical guidance and strict supervision, and on the other hand, give the people of Sichuan Province full encouragement, so that politics trends toward clarity and the economy gradually stabilizes. Only then can bandit suppression succeed, and a spark will not turn into a prairie fire.</p>
<p>In order to achieve autonomy, it must be completed on schedule. Reorganizing the territory is a fundamental and important task. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior is specially consulting with the provincial governments to strictly order the Department of Civil Affairs to formulate a reorganization plan and report to the Ministry before the 22nd year, in accordance with the regulations on provincial, municipal, and county boundaries, and Article 4 of the outline of the methods for reorganizing county administrative areas. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 5 of the outline for reorganizing county administrative areas, it should be implemented in the shortest possible time. This is an important policy.

<p>(Nanjing) In recent years, foreign matches have been sold in China at dumping prices, which has become more and more serious, causing domestic matches to be excluded and unsustainable. According to personnel from the Ministry of Finance, this matter is not just a local problem, but a problem for the entire industrial sector in our country. It must be planned from the root, not just for matches alone. As for the temporary solution, the Foreign Goods Dumping Review Committee should handle it and decide whether to levy anti-dumping duties on matches based on the facts. According to personnel from the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry has long paid attention to the dumping of foreign matches and has considered a state monopoly on domestic matches as an initial step to save domestic matches. Currently, whether the monopoly issue is feasible must be decided by the central government. At present, the rescue method must be to levy anti-dumping duties on matches in order to resist it.

<p>(Nanchang) Chairman of Gansu Zhu Shaoliang submitted his opinions on the provincial system to Chairman Chiang, stating that the current committee system of the provincial government is not as good as the provincial governor system. However, fundamental reforms are still pending, and it seems appropriate to reconcile the spirit of the provincial governor system with the political system of the committee system to seek a suitable approach. The provincial government and the people's livelihood department should first combine their offices to work together. The remaining departments of finance, education, and construction should remain independent. Important matters should be handled by the heads of the relevant departments, who will consult with the chairman of the provincial government at any time to make decisions for implementation. This is in line with the spirit of the provincial governor system while allowing for flexibility in the centralized government orders. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>(New York) According to today's report from the New York Cotton Exchange, after Song Ziwen, the former Minister of Finance of China, established the cotton and wheat loan in the United States, China's purchases of American cotton have not only not increased compared to previous years, but have actually decreased. From June 1 to the end of October 1932, China purchased a total of 61,000 bales of American cotton. This year, from June 5, when the cotton and wheat loan was established, to the end of October, only 52,000 bales were shipped to China. It is believed that the Chinese cotton purchasers have been purchasing in installments and have not made large-scale purchases in order to avoid affecting the Chinese cotton market. Furthermore, the US government's estimated amount of this year's American cotton harvest will be released approximately on Wednesday. According to the private statistics of the International Statistical Bureau, it totals approximately 13,520,000 bales. If there had been no destruction of 10 million mu of cotton seedlings, the reverse science cotton harvest would have exceeded 17 million bales. (National Telegram on the 6th)</p>

<p>(Changchun) As a result of consultations with various parties, the Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway Company, Hatta, the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Isoya, and the authorities of "Manchukuo" will consolidate all industries in Manchuria, such as railways, coal mines, iron manufacturing, light metals, oil, and electricity, to create a general company for a controlled economy. This restructuring plan has been agreed upon by the South Manchuria Railway Company, the Kwantung Army, and "Manchukuo", with a completely unified attitude. What remains is the railway issue. It is proposed to combine the aforementioned industries into a company, follow the "Manchukuo Government" organizational law, be managed by the Ministry of Industry, and form a "Manchukuo" corporation. The fundamental policy is to make the company a unified inclusion of all similar industries and give it a monopoly position. The result of the discussion has been satisfactorily resolved. The Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway Company, Hatta, has returned to Dalian and reported the above situation to the board of directors. He will immediately go to Tokyo to report to the supervisory authorities. At the same time, the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Isoya, will also return to Japan to report to the military headquarters. The relevant departments of the central government will convene a joint meeting to make the final decision, and the various preparations will be made into a plan to be submitted to the next session of the Diet for passage. In this way, it can be implemented in the spring of next year and become a major reform in the history of the South Manchuria Railway Company. It is also heard that the total capital of the new company is expected to exceed 2 billion yuan. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) At the meeting between Chief of Staff Isoya and Vice President Hatta on the 6th, an agreement was reached on the restructuring of the South Manchuria Railway Company, which will soon be presented to the central government. The contents are currently kept strictly secret. It is reported that the main points are as follows: (1) In order to study Japan's policy towards Manchuria, it should be carried out by the Commander of the Kwantung Army as the central organization. Therefore, the South Manchuria Railway Company, which develops the economic artery of Manchuria and Mongolia, must be removed from the hands of the Colonization Ministry and placed under the unified supervision of the Commander. The various businesses of the South Manchuria Railway Company should be separated and reorganized into special companies. The capital of Xiangtie will remain at the current 800 million yuan, and the necessary capital from the mainland should be absorbed and invested in the various branch companies. The departments of railways, coal mines, and commerce, which have been separated, will be accepted by established companies, such as Showa Steel Works, Manchuria Chemical Industry Company, Telegraph and Telephone Company, Mining Company, Datong Electric Company, Light Metals Company, and Petroleum Company. The capital control of the holding companies, except for the holding companies and railways, will be the legal organization of "Manchukuo", subject to the supervision of the Military Commander and "Manchukuo". (2) The local departments will temporarily be affiliated businesses of the holding companies and will continue to manage the affiliated territory as before. When deemed appropriate, they will be transferred to Manchuria. Approximately at the time when Japan abolishes extraterritorial rights, "Manchukuo" is currently considering expenses. (3) The Military Department and the Economic Research Association of the South Manchuria Railway Company will jointly form the Economic Staff Headquarters as an advisory body for the economic organization control of the entire Manchuria.

<p>(Paris) Today, the Paris News published an important article by Trotsky titled "The Current Revolution in Japan." The article elaborates on the current animosity between Japan and Russia and speculates on the outcome of a future conflict between the two countries. According to Trotsky's analysis, the victory in a future war will ultimately belong to the Soviet Union. This is because Russia has not only undergone a complete revolution, but the potential power of the entire nation has also been awakened, allowing it to pour its immense driving force onto the battlefield. Moreover, Japan has not made significant progress since its last victory over Tsarist Russia. Trotsky further stated that the living standards of the Japanese people are lower than those of the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union's industrial resources far surpass those of Japan. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has focused on developing heavy industry, while Japan has focused primarily on light industry. In terms of the physical constitution of the people, the comparison is also unfavorable to Japan. The arrogance of the Japanese military is entirely based on the Prussian military model, borrowing all its flaws without gaining any of its advantages. The natural qualities and individuality of Japanese soldiers, which they relied on to defeat China and Russia, such as individual initiative, focus, and the tenacity to bear personal responsibility, have been completely swept away in today's Japanese military. Trotsky concluded by saying that he did not wish to see a war break out between Russia and Japan. However, according to his observations, both a Russo-Japanese war and a US-Japanese war are within the realm of possibility. (6th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>San Pedro, California - Rear Admiral Cyrus Cole announced today that the US Navy will hold its largest mock battle in recent years next Monday and Tuesday. The entire Pacific Fleet will actually participate. The purpose of this exercise is to test the progress made in tactics by the battle fleet and patrol fleet after a year of exercises at various key ports along the Pacific coast. The location of this operation will be outside the Golden Gate of San Francisco, which is not only the most heavily defended area on the Pacific coast but also the commercial hub of the Pacific coast. In the event of war, it would be a primary target for the enemy, so it was chosen as the site for the mock battle. According to Cole's announcement, in addition to 100 surface warships, all available submarines and more than 300 aircraft, as well as the airship Macon, will participate. This is truly a large-scale exercise on the surface, underwater, and in the sky. It is also the most important demonstration of naval effectiveness before the US fleet sets sail for patrol in the Atlantic next spring. While Cole was announcing the mock battle plan, news from Washington arrived stating that Rear Admiral Standley was also announcing a shipbuilding plan for the next few years in Washington. It is said that next spring, the Navy will ask Congress to approve sufficient funds to build new ships, aiming to reach the strength permitted by the London Treaty by 1939. They will also ask Congress for a guarantee that all old ships that need to be replaced will be replaced during this period and in the years thereafter. Currently, senior naval officers are completely satisfied with the strength permitted by the London Treaty but insist on maintaining maximum effectiveness. (6th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) - A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today regarding Russian Ambassador to Japan, Furenolov's, visit to Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday, that the two spoke for three and a half hours. The Russian Ambassador asked the Foreign Minister to pay attention to the fact that nine Japanese military aircraft flew over the vicinity of Posiet Bay in Russian territory on October 3rd. The Foreign Minister denied this incident. They then discussed the publication of the Hishikari document. The Foreign Minister said that the Soviet government announced this document without first showing it to him or the Japanese Ambassador to Russia. This action has made the situation between Russia and Japan tense. Therefore, both Russia and Japan should strive to create an atmosphere of reconciliation. The Foreign Minister then mentioned that the US government intends to move its Pacific Fleet back to the Atlantic, which has made a good impression on Japan and can be a good example for the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union should also make a gesture to improve Russo-Japanese relations. The Foreign Minister also told the Russian Ambassador that Japan does not want to hinder negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, the current atmosphere is not conducive to the continuation of the meeting.

<p>(London) - The diplomatic correspondent for the Morning Post stated today that the news that a Japanese banking group has obtained cotton planting concessions in Abyssinia has attracted considerable attention. After reading the remarks made yesterday by the Abyssinian Minister of Finance, it seems that the Japanese purchase of 1,000 acres of land to grow cotton is not necessarily the result of Japanese ambition. It is now evident that this is a well-planned and carefully considered plan for commercial and industrial encroachment. However, Abyssinia's access to the sea must pass through the French port of Djibouti. Therefore, the competition for influence within Abyssinia will be concentrated on the port of Djibouti and the ownership of the railway from that port to Addis Ababa. (7th Reuters)</p>

Prime Minister Saito, along with Home Minister Yamamoto, Agriculture Minister Goto, Commerce Minister Nakajima, and Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai, attended and began to discuss rural issues. Prior to the meeting, Prime Minister Saito discussed the participation of cabinet members from the party with Chief Secretary. However, the rural countermeasures of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties were previously submitted to Agriculture Minister Goto and have already been incorporated into the government's plan. Therefore, if the two parties have no special desire to participate, the current five-minister conference will discuss them. At today's meeting, Agriculture Minister Goto began by reporting on the actual situation in rural areas, explaining the balance of rural burdens, the production and sale control of agricultural products, the industrialization of rural areas, and the issues of rice control. After that, they entered into discussions, focusing on the problem of reducing the burden of farmers, which is the tumor of rural areas, and exchanged views. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.

<p>(London) - When Parliament reconvenes today, it will debate the disarmament conference and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will announce the breakdown of war debt negotiations in the United States. After Chamberlain's speech, a white paper will be published, containing the documents exchanged between the British and American governments. At the same time, the remarks made by Prime Minister MacDonald and Baldwin yesterday at the National Labour Committee banquet have attracted great attention in political circles. This is the first time that government leaders have openly declared that all parties in the country should maintain unity and cooperation in the next general election. It is believed that although each party will maintain its individuality, the government intends to contest the next election in the name of a government of national character. (7th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today regarding the British-American war debt issue that the British government is willing to pay the United States 7.5 million dollars on December 15th to show its credibility. President Roosevelt has accepted this and does not view Britain as failing to fulfill its debt obligations. Chamberlain also said that it is unfortunate that the two countries could not reach a final agreement. The government recognizes that there are many difficulties in reaching an agreement at a time of economic and financial instability. The credit payment will be made in US dollars. The government is prepared to reopen war debt negotiations when the time is right. Next, Trade Minister Runciman announced that negotiations on the new Anglo-Soviet trade agreement are still ongoing and making progress, but he could not provide further details.

<p>(Berlin) - Today, German Foreign Minister Neurath delivered an important speech at the German General Assembly in Berlin, pleading in extremely earnest terms for the world's countries to understand Germany's peaceful and progressive purpose in withdrawing from the League of Nations. Regarding the upcoming general election to determine the people's support for withdrawing from the League of Nations, he said that it was an action to express Germany's feelings to the world. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, firstly, cannot be regarded as an expression of Germany's resentment, and secondly, cannot be regarded as retaliation for the disarmament conference. From Germany's perspective, this action is actually a new path to progress that can achieve the goal of global harmony. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations has not created a crisis for the League of Nations. On the contrary, the reason why Germany must withdraw from the League of Nations is actually due to the crisis hidden and developing within the organization of the League of Nations itself, making it impossible for Germany to exist safely within it. All politicians with calm minds and true wills have recognized that there have long been ominous contradictions in the organizational foundation of the League of Nations, which on the one hand vigorously encourages idealized hopes for peace, and on the other hand still represents imperialism that has never been seen in history. In 1919, the peoples of the world were tired of turmoil, so they were overjoyed when they heard of the emergence of a permanent peace governed by justice, but these were all deceptive empty talks, and what they have obtained today is nothing more than a material organization, and its most superficial purpose is to maintain the strong position it obtained through the Treaty of Versailles, in order to perpetually oppress the defeated countries. It is indeed possible for the victorious countries to build an organization to permanently massacre and oppress the defeated countries, and it is also possible for countries to organize a common peace organization on an equal footing, but it is impossible to have both, to allow the defeated countries to be permanently oppressed, and the world to permanently maintain its peace. Neurath then listed the facts that the League of Nations was unable to be fair to Germany, and turned a blind eye to the re-occupation of the Ruhr region in 1923, and was unable to provide adequate protection to the German minority in the German colonies. Finally, he said that Germany's actions today are not a retreat but a step forward towards a practical peace policy. (6th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Prussian Prime Minister Goering met this morning for a long time and were very congenial. Italy wants to bring Germany back into the Geneva framework. After the meeting, a communique was issued, the wording of which was very superficial.

<p>(Washington) - At 9:30 AM this morning, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov arrived in New York. The Chief of Protocol of the government went to receive him. He will arrive in Washington in the evening. Secretary of State Hull will go to the station to welcome him, then pay a courtesy visit to Roosevelt, and speak with Hull. He will meet with the President again on Thursday or Friday, at which time Secretary of State Hull and other important figures will participate in the talks. (6th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) - The White House announced today that several senior officials from the State Department left Washington today for New York, and will take a small ferry to the bay to board the Berengaria, representing the government to welcome Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, and then escort him into New York Harbor to disembark. He will immediately take a special train to Washington. Secretary of State Hull, accompanied by Undersecretary of State Phillips, Assistant Secretary of State Bullitt, and other important figures, will go to Union Station to greet him. Upon leaving the station, Litvinov will immediately go to the White House to see the US President, then retreat to his residence, and visit Hull and others at the State Department on Wednesday morning for preliminary negotiations. At noon, he will attend a luncheon at the White House. (6th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) - According to news from the Berengaria, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov stated on the ship that if the US and Russia restore relations, former Ambassador to Japan, Troyanovsky, will be appointed as the first Ambassador to the United States. Litvinov has now arrived in New York. According to US government sources, Litvinov will begin talks approximately on Thursday or Friday after arriving in Washington. As for the reason for Litvinov's selection of Troyanovsky, according to a telegram from the Berengaria, it is because Troyanovsky successfully resolved many Russo-Japanese disputes during his tenure in Tokyo, making him the most suitable candidate at present. It is predicted that after becoming Ambassador to the United States in the future, he will be able to enable the US and Russia to have a united policy in the Far East if possible. However, Litvinov stated that this is only a possibility, and it is still doubtful whether it can be realized in the near future. It is heard that although Litvinov is willing to follow the path proposed by the US President for negotiations, he advocates exchanging documents for the restoration of relations as soon as possible, and then the two countries, as friendly nations, should discuss debt, trade, and credit issues at length. He believes that the two countries should first exchange ambassadors, and then discuss other matters, so that they can be resolved through normal diplomatic channels. Litvinov also stated that he would not make such a proposal until the cooperation between the US and Russia in the Far East is discussed in the general talks. However, the general opinion here is that the US President may not mention this matter, and it is believed that the US President will first discuss debt and other issues, and then exchange documents to restore diplomatic relations.

Recently, Ambassador Debuchi went to the State Department to bid farewell to Secretary of State Hull. Debuchi plans to leave Washington on November 24th. His urgency to bid farewell is due to two reasons: one is that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov is about to arrive in the United States, and the other is that Secretary of State Hull will soon go to the capital of Uruguay for the Pan-American Conference.

<h3 id="e56">Merchants Using the Blue Eagle Logo to Enrich Their Own Pockets: US Senator Borah: US Senator Borah: Expresses Dissatisfaction with the Progress of the Recovery <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Parma, Idaho - Senator Borah stated in a speech here today that the Blue Eagle logo has been used by profiteers as a mask to sacrifice wage earners and enrich their own pockets. He cannot sympathize with the government's efforts to help increase sales, but he feels that there are loopholes in the regulations to prevent those who sign industrial recovery regulations and hang the Blue Eagle logo on their doors from raising retail prices far beyond the price increases that should have resulted from industrial progress. This group is using the National Recovery Administration as a shield to obscure their treacherous plans to raise prices and make profits, causing the people to sink deeper into the abyss. Currently, the retail prices of various goods are far exceeding the production costs, with the worst cases even raising prices by 63% to 120%. This price increase plan is enough to render the government's "buy now" campaign ineffective. The public, willing to buy goods at fair prices, are all backing away in the face of these outrageous prices of manufactured goods. As a result, the lack of purchasers has caused the government's unemployment relief work to lose most of its effectiveness. This group of profiteers will make the coming winter even more difficult for the poor, etc.</p>
<p>In previous speeches, Borah had urged the people to pay attention to efforts to resolve British war debts, saying that if war debts could be greatly reduced or completely cancelled several years ago, it would greatly benefit world trade and commerce. Now, the situation has changed, and even if cancelled, it will have little effect. Borah has long advocated that the United States could greatly reduce war debts if Europe agreed to large-scale disarmament, but now he feels that there is little hope for this.

<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini reorganized his cabinet, exclusively holding the three ministries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The dismissal of Air Minister General Balbo was unexpected. Balbo had become the most powerful and active figure in Italy after twice leading a large squadron of aircraft across the Atlantic and returning home victorious. While the positions of others may have been shaken, Balbo was as solid as a rock. Italians even said that if something untoward happened to Mussolini, his successor would be none other than Balbo. It was unexpected that he would leave office at the same time as those considered by Mussolini to be obsolete. This was truly beyond the expectations of the general public. After the resignation of the Vice Ministers of the Air Force and Navy, they have been replaced by General Val and Admiral Cavagnari. After the resignation of Navy Minister Admiral Sirianni, he has abandoned his political career and become the President of the Pietmont Steel Company. Mussolini sent personal letters to Sirianni and Balbo, expressing his gratitude for their contributions to the country. (4th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome - The Tribune commented on the personnel changes in the cabinet, roughly saying, "The Prime Minister's changes to the cabinet this time are intended to make the Army, Navy, and Air Force and administrative and financial agencies, as well as other agencies, cooperate in unison, to seek spiritual unity, and to make the Pan-Nationalist Party politics not only coordinated in organization, but also consistently applied in spirit." Since then, the main departmental affairs of the Italian government have been held concurrently by Mussolini, reaching as many as five departments. (6th Havas Telegraph)</p>

<p>A telegram from Nanchang reports that Chairman Chiang convened a food conference last month, attended by rice-producing provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui, and rice-consuming provinces and cities such as Guangdong, Shanghai, and Hebei. Detailed discussions were held on eliminating obstacles to grain circulation, seeking convenience in grain transportation and sales, and providing relief to rural finance. Yesterday, he specially submitted a request to the Central Government based on the resolutions and ordered each province to implement them one by one. The telegrams to the President of the Executive Yuan, the chairmen of the eight provincial governments, and the mayor of Shanghai are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Telegram to the President of the Executive Yuan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang telegraphed the President of the Executive Yuan, saying, "This headquarters held a food conference on the 2nd and 3rd of October, attended by representatives from ten provinces and cities including Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shanghai, and Guangdong, as well as the National Defense Design Committee. A proposal was made to reduce and eliminate difficulties in grain transportation. It was unanimously agreed that low grain prices hurt farmers and that rice prices should be increased to provide relief. However, if rice prices are to be high, obstacles must be eliminated and transportation must be facilitated so that grain is not oversupplied in one area, leading to a sharp drop in prices, while areas lacking rice face the worry of food shortages. The way to provide relief is to facilitate transportation and reduce transportation costs, which will promote circulation and reduce costs to compete with foreign rice. The main reason for the influx of foreign rice in recent years is that foreign governments encourage dumping. Foreign merchants, with the advantage of convenient transportation and low freight rates, sell at low prices and overwhelm the market. However, the opposite is true in our country. According to reports, it costs 7 jiao per 100 jin to transport rice from Wuhu to Qingdao via Shanghai, 7.4 jiao to Tianjin, 6.7 jiao to Yantai and Weihaiwei, and 6.5 jiao to Dalian. Currently, grain merchants transporting rice to Tianjin are losing several jiao to more than one yuan per bag based on current market prices due to high freight rates. The cost of transporting Wuhu rice directly to Guangzhou or Tianjin is also prohibitive. As a result, domestic rice sales are further stagnant, more foreign rice is imported, and the rural economy is increasingly impoverished. In addition to telegraphing the central government to levy heavy and rapid import duties on foreign rice, we should also ask the Ministries of Communications and Railways to instruct various shipping companies and railway bureaus to give priority to allocating ships and vehicles to those who request to transport rice, properly formulate joint transportation measures, reduce transportation procedures, and reduce freight rates to about 50% of the original price, or the government should appropriately subsidize to compensate for its additional losses, which will promote its implementation to resolve the misfortune of domestic rice. The above, etc., were resolved and recorded on file. In addition to telegraphing separately, this telegram is sent to you, hoping that you will investigate and handle it, and promptly reply with a well-defined plan on how to effectively verify and reduce freight rates and provide other conveniences.

<h3 id="e97">Telegram to the Chairmen of the Eight Provinces <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang telegraphed the Chairmen of the Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, and Henan Provincial Governments and the Mayor of Shanghai, (1) "It is found that this headquarters convened a food conference on the 2nd and 3rd of October, proposing to restrict additional land taxes. It was resolved that the provincial governments should be telegraphed to ensure that the additional land tax does not exceed the limit set by the Ministry of Finance, and that a thorough investigation should be made of the current collection situation in various places to effectively reduce it, etc., as recorded on file. It is found that the collection of additional land taxes in various provinces has long been clearly restricted by the Central Ministry of Finance. However, in recent years, each county has often raised local administrative expenses without complying with the standards set by the Ministry of Finance, each going its own way. The provincial finance departments arbitrarily impose additional taxes, or even the counties privately impose additional taxes, and the provincial departments have no record of it. Such unlimited collection, only aiming at the convenience of collecting additional taxes, levies local expenses specifically from the farmers and people who have land. The result is that it not only accelerates the collapse of the countryside but also affects the income of the regular tax, which is tantamount to suicide. It is urgent to quickly correct this. It is hoped that you will promptly and accurately list and submit for investigation to this headquarters all additional land taxes in each county and urban area under your province, and that you will thoroughly reduce the additional tax law and report it properly. Chiang Chung-cheng Seal." (2) "It is found that this headquarters convened a food conference on the 2nd and 3rd of this month, proposing to abolish harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies on rice. It was resolved that each province and city should thoroughly investigate the collection of rice taxes and levies and formulate effective reduction and exemption measures for implementation, etc., as recorded on file. It is found that our country is founded on agriculture. The common people work diligently throughout the year, and all they get is grain. Their clothing, food, and living all depend on it. However, it has recently been found that many rice-producing provinces often use the excuse that there are no funds for administrative expenses, and they actually collect taxes on rice. Even local groups below the county level create various pretexts to privately collect taxes on rice without reporting to the province for record. Layer upon layer of exploitation heavily burdens the farmers. Now that the bandit atmosphere has not subsided and the farmers are in deep distress, those in local authority should make it their top priority to relieve the suffering of the people. It is urgent to investigate the aforementioned resolution measures, supervise the officials under your jurisdiction to thoroughly investigate and list the various taxes and levies on rice collected in the province and city, and submit them to this headquarters for investigation, and effectively reduce and exempt these harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies. Chiang Chung-cheng."</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang telegraphed the provinces to prohibit hoarding and obstructing transportation, roughly saying, "In the past, various places often used the excuse of disaster and insufficient food to hoard and obstruct transportation, hindering the circulation of food and creating a situation of confrontation between bountiful disasters and famine disasters. From now on, all such actions are strictly prohibited to allow for free buying and selling, connecting production and sales, and adjusting surpluses and shortages, thus avoiding stagnation."</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang also specially ordered the provincial and municipal governments to investigate and suppress the abuses in local grain shops, which monopolize and profit in the middle, disregarding the people's food and affecting the circulation of food, (1) stipulate their legitimate commissions, (2) cancel all extra miscellaneous expenses, and (3) supervise local chambers of commerce and grain trade associations to improve their organizations.

<p>A telegram from Nanchang reports that Chairman Chiang recently announced ten items of improved bandit suppression tactics in "War and Youth," the third of which is to fix the garrison area of each unit for exclusive defense, that is, each army has its own jurisdiction, each division has its own jurisdiction, and so on to each brigade, regiment, and battalion, so that responsibility is clear, authority is centralized, and the organization is strict. It has now been implemented to delineate areas and, based on the terrain and distance adjacent to the bandit area and the distribution of bandit forces, assign the jurisdiction of each unit, designate the target for guerrilla warfare against the bandits and the scope of their guerrilla warfare and reconnaissance, so that the troops and targets within this scope are gradually advanced towards the bandit area in phases, by routes, and by areas, to fundamentally eliminate them. According to publicly released news, in addition to approving Zhao Guantao as the Garrison Commander of the Jiangxi-Zhejiang border and Zhou Hunyuan as the Garrison Commander of the Jiangxi-Fujian border, Chiang has also delineated Fuzhou, Nancheng, Qingjiang, Yongfeng, and other garrison areas, and appointed the army division commanders stationed in each area as the garrison commanders to maintain public order and facilitate the blockade, so as to prevent the Red bandits from escaping and causing trouble everywhere.

<p>A telegram from Changsha reports that the provincial government issued 5 million yuan of national salvation public debt, claiming it was for the purpose of resisting Japan and suppressing bandits. It was approved by the Central Government. The promotion method was to assign each of the 76 cities and counties in the province to raise tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yuan. Changsha City, as the capital of the province, was assigned to raise 1 million yuan. However, since its implementation, various counties and cities and Hunan fellow villagers in Beijing have risen up in opposition, or requested reductions. The provincial government knew that the people's strength could not overcome it, so it reduced it to 60%, actually raising 3 million yuan. Because there was no need to raise funds to resist Japan, it was changed to 2.5 million yuan for the Western Route Army's bandit suppression expenses, and 500,000 yuan for subsidies for recruiting labor to build roads, and it was set to subsidize 500 yuan per li. The original limit was to raise enough in three months, but now six months have passed. Statistics show that only 600,000 to 700,000 yuan has been raised in the entire province, and it was obtained through strict urging. For example, in Hengyang County, those who were imprisoned for failing to raise the required funds were overcrowded. In addition, appeals for exemptions and telegrams were endless. The 600,000 to 700,000 yuan that has been collected has come mostly from Changsha City. For example, the one-month rent of the entire city was levied, totaling about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Each collection staff member carried two soldiers and went door-to-door to urge payment. Those who did not comply were immediately arrested. Eight or nine out of ten have now been collected, and there is nothing more to change. In recent days, soldiers have been sent to various shops to urge the payment of public debt levied on operating capital. It is estimated that each money shop, gold shop, silk and cloth shop, and foreign goods shop has two or four soldiers stationed in the shop to demand payment. If the payment is not made one day, the soldiers will not be removed for one day. The home of Huang Bochang, chairman of the money industry association, also has four soldiers stationed and strictly pursuing payment. Huang was furious and resigned from the industry association. He also submitted a report to the government, explaining that this method not only hinders business but also causes panic. At the same time, the main figures of various industries in Changsha held a meeting and decided that unless the government withdraws the order to send troops to levy national salvation public debt, Changsha bankers would implement an economic boycott against the government, because the Director of Finance, Zhang Kailian, had to borrow 200,000 to 300,000 yuan from the city's bankers at the beginning of each month to pay the administrative expenses of various agencies. Today (the 4th) is the due date for the payment of administrative expenses for October, but it has not yet been paid, which is because the bankers have implemented an economic boycott against the government, causing the Finance Department to be unable to transfer funds. Zhang Kailian is very anxious and is currently asking Zuo Yizhai, chairman of the Changsha Chamber of Commerce, to mediate, hoping for a satisfactory solution. (November 4)</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Party Conflict in Hunan Province Rises Again, The Mutual Exclusion of the A and B Factions Intensifies, All Party Affairs Completely Stalled <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Changsha reports that cracks have appeared between the A and B factions of the Kuomintang Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters, resulting in the failure to convene the Fourth Provincial Congress of the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters, which was approved by the Central Party Headquarters to be held on July 20, and party affairs have been stalled. The Central Party Headquarters sent Chen Lifu to Hunan to inspect and mediate, but without result. The Central Party Headquarters then stipulated four principles for resolving the Hunan Party conflict, ordering the A faction to reinstate the dismissed committee members, ordering the B faction committee member Liu Yuehou to express to the Central Party Headquarters the error of organizing the Road Association in the past and causing party conflicts in various counties, and the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government are responsible for preventing the provocation of party conflicts in Changsha's major and minor newspapers. After the above items can be strictly observed by both sides, the Central Party Headquarters will send personnel to participate in the preparation of the Fourth Provincial Congress. Three months have passed, and although the A and B factions superficially accept the resolution method set by the Central Government, they are still engaged in intrigue and secretly compete even more fiercely than before. In summary, among the seven executive committee members, the A faction members Wang Qi and Zhang Jiong are serving in the central government, remotely directing everything. Only Zhu Haohuai and Xie Zuyue are active in Hunan. The B faction is Tan Changkai, who has been transferred back to the central government. Because of the party conflict, the issue of succession has not been resolved for several months. He Jian and Huang Jiasheng have also requested leave for excuses and never go to the headquarters. Therefore, the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters is only presided over by the A faction members Zhu and Xie, which is not enough to meet the legal quorum, and everything is still stalled. Moreover, the A faction has the central government as its backing and can command and order from top to bottom. The B faction is based on the party headquarters of various counties and cities and can launch everything from bottom to top by using the active forces of the Road Association in the party headquarters of various counties and cities. Recently, the party conflict in Hunan has reached the point of imminent clash. On October 27, the Changsha Municipal Party Headquarters, under the leadership of the B faction, held its 169th executive committee meeting and suddenly resolved to promote the opening of the Fourth Provincial Congress of Hunan Province, appointing Miao Kunce to petition the Central Party Headquarters and Huang Ji to petition the Provincial Party Headquarters. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the party headquarters of various counties and cities in Hunan.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Whereabouts of Shi Dakai's Seal: Finally Falling into the Hands of a Sichuan Military Man; Central Government Orders Liu Xiang to Investigate, Confiscate, and Preserve <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Shi Dakai, the Wing King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, attacked and seized Sichuan but was defeated by Tang Junmen, the Qing army's admiral, who led his troops. Shi Dakai's seal was then obtained by Tang. The seal was made of wujin [dark gold], making it very valuable. Tang's grandson, Tang Wenyu, initially lived on Wenmiao Street in the South Gate of Chengdu. When Shi Zhaowu, the guard brigade commander of the 24th Army, was stationed in the provincial capital, he heard that the Tang family possessed Shi Dakai's seal. He then claimed that Shi Dakai was his grandfather and sent people to forcibly take the seal from Tang. This year, the Sichuan war broke out, and the 24th Army was defeated. Shi was captured by Li Qixiang's troops in Qionglai. After reporting to Liu Xiang, the pacification commissioner, Shi was executed by firing squad. Later, someone mentioned the matter of Shi Dakai's seal being hidden in Shi's home, and the matter was reported to the central party headquarters. The central party headquarters then telegraphed Liu Xiang, ordering him to confiscate the seal, send it to the headquarters for preservation, and then forward it to the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall for display. Upon receiving the telegram, Liu Xiang ordered the Chengdu garrison to dispatch personnel to investigate and confiscate the seal. Recently, Liao Haitao, the commander of the garrison, replied to Liu Xiang, stating that Shi Dakai's seal had been lost. The original text stated, "Your subordinate</p>
<p>previously received Your Excellency's telegram in accordance with the Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters' letter, regarding the seal of the late martyr Wing King Shi Dakai, which was transferred from Tang Baichuan to Shi Zhaowu's possession. We were ordered to investigate and confiscate it immediately, so that it could be transferred to the central party headquarters for preservation, etc. Upon receiving this, we immediately dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Zhou Jicheng and Councilor Hu Luban to investigate. According to the officers' report, Shi Zhaowu's family members stated that due to two street battles in the provincial capital, and Shi Zhaowu's subsequent death, they were displaced, and the whereabouts of Shi Dakai's seal were unknown. Just as we were about to report this, Shi Dihua submitted a statement claiming that her husband, Shi Zhaowu, had previously received a gift of Shi Dakai's seal from a friend, of which she was aware. Subsequently, due to two street battles in the provincial capital last year, all items in their residence on Gulou South Street and their relocated residence in the Wenzu Temple in the South Gate, including clothing, were lost, and the house was severely damaged. Shi Dakai's seal was also lost at the same time. After the war subsided, she immediately requested the 24th Army headquarters to record the loss for future reference. After the 24th Army withdrew this year, she had intended to request Your Excellency's headquarters to report to the Pacification Commissioner's office for record, but due to her husband's death, she was unable to manage household affairs and delayed until today to request Your Excellency's headquarters to record the loss for future reference," etc. According to this, we respectfully submit this document to Your Excellency's office for record." It is rumored that Shi Dakai's seal has not been lost but was obtained by Li Zongfang, the brigade commander of the Border Defense General Headquarters, who refuses to hand it over. Liao Haitao had no way to force him, so he fabricated a story to deceive the Pacification Commissioner's office to avoid further investigation. (November 5th)</p>
<p>Unanimously advocated. In recent days, party headquarters from various counties have responded with telegrams, and major and minor newspapers in Changsha, sympathetic to the Yi faction, have published articles supporting it, criticizing the Jia faction for delaying the Fourth Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Congress out of a reluctance to relinquish power. The Yi faction, with its influence in various counties and cities, aims to seize this opportunity to convene the Fourth Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Congress and achieve a decisive victory in the re-election. The Jia faction committee members convened a cadre meeting to discuss countermeasures, ultimately resolving on seven points: (1) Zhu Haohuai (Zhu is a committee member assigned by the central government to work in Hunan) was to secretly telegraph the central government, requesting changes to the electoral laws for the Hunan Provincial Fourth Plenary Session and postponing the session's convocation. (2) Large numbers of cadres were to be secretly dispatched to various counties to obstruct the dispatch of telegrams responding to and urging the convocation of the Hunan Provincial Fourth Plenary Session. (3) The faction was to secretly order its subordinates to create an atmosphere of manipulation of provincial party affairs through the "Road Association" and give it the name "Road Association Faction." (4) The faction was to use newspapers to fabricate various party affairs disputes to divert attention. (5) If telegrams urging the convocation of the Hunan Provincial Fourth Plenary Session from various counties and cities could not be prevented, they were to be secretly suppressed and not published. (6) Party affairs news was to be blocked, and newspaper reporters were to be denied entry to various departments. All internal staff were forbidden from concurrently working as newspaper reporters or communicating with newspaper reporters. A propaganda department cadre was to be assigned to exclusively release party affairs news to facilitate propaganda. (7) If necessary, the entire committee would resign again to prevent the convocation of the Fourth Plenary Session. Thus, the two factions have resorted to extreme measures, and the party conflict is escalating. (November 4th)</p>

<p>Hefei Correspondence: The Puxin Railway, starting from Pukou in Jiangsu, passing through the counties of Chao, He, Liu, and Li in Anhui, and reaching Xinyang in Henan, had its route designated during the late Qing Dynasty, and funds were being raised for its construction. However, due to political changes, construction could not commence. Currently, banditry persists in Li, Huang and other counties, and suppressing the communists is hindered by inconvenient transportation. The construction of this railway is truly necessary. Qin Zhenfu, the commissioner of the Third District of Anhui, recognizing this, submitted a request to the joint bandit suppression headquarters of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, and the Anhui provincial government, to allocate the American wheat and cotton loan for the construction. Subsequently, instructions were received from the headquarters and the provincial government to forward the request to the Ministry of Railways for review.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Coal Industry Association Urgent Telegram: To Shanghai Shenbao: Our association and the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese Association are embroiled in a dispute over Fushun coal powder. The Anti-Japanese Association has abused its authority by arresting staff members of various coal stores, causing unrest. Our association has submitted a petition to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and other agencies for review and protection. We are now forwarding the original petition via telegraph to your esteemed newspaper, requesting that you uphold justice. The petition is as follows: "Petition for the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese Association's Abuse of Authority and Illegal Detention of Merchants; Request for Legal Protection to Safeguard the Coal Industry. Since the September 18th Mukden Incident, Japanese aggression has incited national indignation. Our coal industry colleagues share the same enthusiasm for boycotting enemy goods. After being notified by the Anti-Japanese Association, fifteen members of the association, including Duntaisheng and Liu Dechang, immediately registered the remaining Fushun coal powder sold before September 18th, as well as the Kelazi coal from four companies including Mao Hengsheng Xiexing, with the association. In February of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], the Anti-Japanese Association, to facilitate public identification of Japanese goods, compiled and published a 'Comparison List of National and Japanese Goods' for reference by all sectors. This list was originally intended to guide merchants by the knowledgeable leaders of the Anti-Japanese Association and should have been printed only after thorough investigation and rigorous review. However, upon checking page 312 of the list, under the 'Coal' category, it was clearly stated that Fushun coal powder was a substitute for domestic goods. Only then did Duntaisheng and the other fourteen companies realize that their previous registration was a mistake. At that time, the January 28th Shanghai Incident was raging, transportation was disrupted, and the supply of coal in Hangzhou was becoming increasingly scarce, leading to a situation where demand exceeded supply. Therefore, they considered that Fushun coal powder, according to the Anti-Japanese Association's 'Comparison List of National and Japanese Goods,' was a substitute for domestic goods and should be sold to alleviate the market and prevent a fuel panic. Furthermore, Fushun coal powder has a high sulfur content and is prone to spontaneous combustion if stored for too long, posing a safety hazard. For example, Liu Dechang's coal has already turned into coal slag, which can still be verified. On March 20th, March 22nd, and July 13th of this year, six companies, including Duntaisheng, Liu Dechang, Taichang, Yinsheng, Renji, and Qiankang, received notices from the Anti-Japanese Association, stating that because they had opened the sealed goods without authorization, the Anti-Japanese Association demanded they confiscate the value of the merchandise from the six companies, including Duntaisheng and Liu Dechang, and imposed a fine of double the value of the merchandise etc. The merchants were astonished and immediately stated the facts in writing and protested twice. The Anti-Japanese Association ignored them. On October 6th, the Anti-Japanese Association, led by the guards of the association, illegally detained staff members of six companies, including Duntaisheng and Liu Dechang. Liu Dechang's registered Fushun coal powder had not even been sold, but the association indiscriminately detained and severely punished the staff of that company as well, and they have not been released to this day. The Anti-Japanese Association was established to boycott enemy goods. Its scope of punishment should be limited to goods smuggled in after September 18th. The Fushun coal powder of Duntaisheng, Liu Dechang, etc., was in stock before September 18th and had been identified by the Anti-Japanese Association as a substitute for domestic goods. Merchants selling it were not in the wrong and should not be punished. Even according to the directive of the Provincial Executive Committee (directive photograph attached), the Anti-Japanese Association originally listed it as a substitute for domestic goods, leading the merchants to sell the goods. Even if there was a mistake, the blame lies with the Anti-Japanese Association, not the merchants. The facts are clear and cannot be overturned. However, the Anti-Japanese Association dared to contradict itself, punish merchants, and openly go back on its word. This is truly a reversal of justice. Furthermore, the merchants voluntarily registered the goods, and the Anti-Japanese Association did not seal them beforehand. After the merchants sold the goods, they were accused of opening the seal without authorization, which is a completely fabricated charge. The merchants have protested repeatedly, but the Anti-Japanese Association has stubbornly ignored them, obscured the facts, and presented a statement to the Provincial Executive Committee to suppress them. The Provincial Executive Committee did not investigate the circumstances and hastily ordered that the case be handled according to precedent. This is either intentional bias or being deceived. The Anti-Japanese Association has become even more unscrupulous, abusing its power and ignoring the law, forcing merchants to pay fines and illegally detaining staff members. Their audacity is boundless, and there is no justice. Merchants who are engaged in honest business are being trampled upon, and they are truly aggrieved. If the Anti-Japanese Association continues to persecute them, it is feared that the members of the association will become indignant and automatically suspend business, causing a fuel panic in the market. Our association cannot be held responsible. We are expressing our grievances and earnestly appealing to Your Excellency to grant protection, to instruct the Hangzhou Anti-Japanese Association to release the illegally detained staff members first, to rescind the original decision, to exempt them from punishment, to uphold justice, and to relieve the hardships of merchants. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted by the Hangzhou Coal Industry Association."</p>

The autopsy confirmed that the deceased had been kicked in the small intestine, resulting in death. The county government recently brought the culprit Wang Fei to court for trial. Although Wang Fei refused to confess directly, the evidence was conclusive and difficult to deny. As a result, he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Yang Hanchu and Yang Linsheng, father and son, natives of this area, were originally carpenters. They later joined bandits and engaged in kidnapping and robbery. On the night of October 2nd of last year, they colluded with escaped bandits Jiangbei Asan, Awu, Zhu Jinlin, and others to kidnap Zhu Xingen and Zhu Liangen, farmers from Caiyuan Township, Fourth District of the county, demanding a ransom of 2,000 yuan. In July of this year, the two bandits were arrested in Shanghai by the Fourth Detachment of the Provincial Water Police and brought back to the county for questioning. They confessed to the kidnapping and extortion without denial. They were sentenced to death in accordance with the law for punishing bandits, and the sentence was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 3:00 PM, the two bandits, father and son, were brought from the prison. Investigator Hu informed them that they were to be executed by firing squad today and asked if they had any last words. At that time, the bandit Yang Hanchu repeatedly cried out for justice, while his son Linsheng angrily accused his father of ruining his young life. They were then verified, tied up, and taken to the execution ground outside the South Gate to be executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency: Mr. Meres, chairman of the China-British</p>
<p>Banking Corporation,</p>
<p>recently visited major cities in North</p>
<p>and South China. At a banquet held on November 1st</p>
<p>by the Pan-Pacific Association and other members,</p>
<p>Mr. Meres shared his impressions of</p>
<p>this trip, which were published in the Continental Daily News.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt concerning Chinese railways:</p>
<p>Mr. Meres felt that Chinese railways</p>
<p>were much more orderly than before, and that the service</p>
<p>personnel were not in the arrogant and</p>
<p>unruly state that he had observed when he left China in 1927.</p>
<p>In other aspects, Mr. Meres observed</p>
<p>many traces of natural damage, proving</p>
<p>that human intervention had been insufficient</p>
<p>in the past few years. He believed that</p>
<p>worn sleepers should be replaced and equipment</p>
<p>that needed replenishment should be replenished. He saw</p>
<p>many vehicles and locomotives idled on the tracks,</p>
<p>which he deeply regretted. He believed that</p>
<p>maximizing the use of locomotives and freight cars</p>
<p>is the secret to the prosperity of railways. The Chinese</p>
<p>engineers he met were doing their best</p>
<p>to compensate for this shortcoming. Railways are</p>
<p>a valuable asset that should be</p>
<p>preserved with the utmost effort by the people.</p>
<p>Mr. Meres observed the existing railways in this way,</p>
<p>and was very complimentary about the progress</p>
<p>China is making in building new railways.</p>
<p>He heard that China is making great</p>
<p>efforts to complete the Yuehan Railway.</p>
<p>The uncompleted section of the line</p>
<p>is currently estimated to be 275 miles.</p>
<p>He spoke with officials in Guangzhou,</p>
<p>who told him that once the line is connected,</p>
<p>rice from Hunan can be transported to Guangdong,</p>
<p>and salt from Guangdong can be transported to Hunan.</p>
<p>Mr. Meres urged the officials to pay</p>
<p>even more attention to the development</p>
<p>of coal mines along the line.</p>

<p>The Railway Bureau received a telegram</p>
<p>from the railways yesterday, stating that the temporary</p>
<p>suspension of coal and coke freight rate increases</p>
<p>for each line would be extended to November 20th. (Omission)</p>
<p>It has now been decided to extend the</p>

<p>In addition to sending telegrams separately, this telegram</p>

<h3 id="e126">Cotton Yarn Exchange Incident: The Cotton Control Association's Attitude; The Suspension of Business at the Exchange Is Regrettable; But the Relief Work of the Control Association Cannot Be Delayed; Otherwise, How Can Millions of Workers Survive? <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency: After the establishment of the Cotton</p>
<p>Control Association, it received a letter</p>
<p>from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Tax</p>
<p>Administration had submitted a request from the Chinese</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Factory Association to maintain yarn prices,</p>
<p>and requesting that the association investigate the</p>
<p>reasons for the decline in yarn prices and</p>
<p>quickly discuss relief measures to safeguard the yarn</p>
<p>industry. After investigation, the biggest reason</p>
<p>for the decline in yarn prices since</p>
<p>spring was found to be that</p>
<h3 id="e127">Cotton Prices Are High, Yarn Prices Are Low <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Cotton mills that were unable to sustain</p>
<p>themselves had to use inferior raw materials,</p>
<p>resulting in products that were not very</p>
<p>suitable for the market,</p>
<p>and speculators used this as a tool</p>
<p>to sell and dump yarn at the exchange,</p>
<p>resulting in increasing accumulation,</p>
<p>and yarn prices continued to decline.</p>
<p>Traders dared not absorb large quantities,</p>
<p>and domestic family weaving industries,</p>
<p>which relied on yarn shops for credit</p>
<p>to maintain their work,</p>
<p>mostly lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Cotton Control Association, after deliberation,</p>
<p>believed that, given the current autumn sales season,</p>
<p>in order to support the hand-weaving industry</p>
<p>and cotton mills, it was urgent</p>
<h3 id="e128">Methods for Relief: Moreover, the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Yarn Exchange, which was originally intended to balance the prices of cotton yarn, has now become a place for dumping goods. It should also be banned. The following measures have been decided upon: (1) The yarn stored in the exchange will be purchased by the Control Committee at market price, with a large portion transported to various places for sale. (2) The Control Committee will revise the exchange's standards and inspection regulations in conjunction with the exchange. (3) Starting from October, the Control Committee will dispatch experts to jointly inspect all delivered cotton yarn with the exchange. (4) The Control Committee will consult with the Chinese Cotton Mill Association to urge various mills to implement the resolutions passed at the association's general meeting on July 8th of this year (the resolution stated that from July 8th to the end of this year, the mills would no longer deliver yarn to the exchange), and also send letters to the Ministry of Industry and the exchange's supervisors for assistance. <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>[P Implementing this plan: Various measures are already being carried out separately. It is regrettable that the exchange had to suspend operations to implement item (4) under the order of the Ministry of Industry. Upon investigation, the yarn stored in the exchange has been increasing month by month from spring to autumn, providing speculators with opportunities to oversell at excessive quantities, which is an unavoidable fact. If this continues without relief measures, the nation's cotton mills and handloom weavers will eventually collapse. How will the millions of workers and villagers who depend on cotton for their livelihoods survive? Therefore, the Control Committee's current</p>
<h3 id="e129">Relief Efforts are both urgent and unchangeable facts. The brokers and speculators in the exchange should be able to express sympathy for the millions of farmers and workers who depend on cotton for their livelihoods. Moreover, this committee has already agreed on measures with the Chinese cotton mill industry: all goods sold by the mills to customers should be taken back by the mills themselves. The exchange's future regulations will be changed, transforming the real goods dumping market into a sound hedging mechanism. This is especially beneficial to the cotton industry and the exchange's brokers themselves. Therefore, it is hoped that all parties will contribute to its success. <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>

The incident occurred because the engines malfunctioned, the ship was unable to move, and a large amount of water entered the engine room, causing the ship to sink. The ship sent out a distress call by radio, and the coastal radio station immediately reported it to the Japanese Mail Steamship Company for rescue.</p>

<h3 id="e136">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Launch Water-Land Through Transport, Starting with Three Key Routes: Longhai, Jiaoji, and Pinghan <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The 32 articles of the nationwide water-land through transport contract signed between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ministry of Railways have been finalized. The company is now planning to start with the Longhai Railway, as the goods from the northwest are most congested on this route, with large quantities of cotton and miscellaneous grains waiting to be transported. Due to the temporary wharf at Sunjiashan not being completed on the 15th, the sailing has been postponed for five days. Zhou Songnian, who was appointed by the Longhai Railway to Shanghai to handle water-land through transport, has arrived in Shanghai and is consulting with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to implement the through transport matters. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e137">Standing Committee Meeting Held Yesterday The Standing Committee of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held a routine meeting at 4 PM yesterday. Attendees included Zhang Shouyong, Liu Hongsheng, <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Ye Zhuotang, Sheng Pinchen, and Yang Zhixiong. The meeting began with General Manager Liu Hongsheng reporting on the progress of the water-land through transport with the Ministry of Railways' Through Transport Office. The contract agreed upon in Beijing was approved and will be submitted to the Board of Directors' routine meeting this Thursday for ratification. The progress will then be reported to the Ministry of Communications. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Regular Service to Be Launched on the Longhai Railway <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Water-land through transport on the Longhai Railway is scheduled to begin on the 20th. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has established a separate section to handle all operational matters related to through transport, appointing Zhou Fengtu as the director. The Longhai Railway Bureau attaches great importance to this matter and has also transferred eight staff members to Shanghai to be stationed at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to assist with the through transport of goods and the storage of goods at the docks and warehouses. The shipping rates for water-land through transport have been negotiated and set. The Railway Bureau has agreed to grant the workers at Dabu Port's request to employ half of the 3,000-plus workers to handle the loading and unloading at Sunjiashan wharf, in order to maintain the workers' livelihoods. Kang Zhenji has exclusively obtained the right to transport goods from Lianyungang. The Railway Bureau has also built a 5,000-ton capacity warehouse, free of charge, for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ships to store goods. It is said that the first through transport ship on the 20th will still be operated by Tonghua.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Jiaoji Railway to Be Implemented Soon The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's second through transport route <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>under consideration is the Jiaoji route. Since the Northeast was seized, the goods from Jiaoji have been on the rise, especially miscellaneous grains and raw peanuts,</p>
<p>which are mostly transported to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong. In the past eight months, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has earned more than 200,000 yuan on the Qingdao route. If through transport is implemented, the shipping industry will be even more developed. In preparation for the Jiaoji through transport, the company has leased Wuyang and Kunxing from Yuan'an Zhaoxing. The contract was signed yesterday for a monthly rent of 9,600 to 10,000 yuan. The ships will be designated to travel between Qingdao and Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong. However, during this process, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau and the Qingdao Port Authority have suddenly encountered a problem: the port authority refuses to accept the continuation fee for the transfer of goods to the dock, thereby making it impossible for the Jiaoji goods to be loaded onto the ships, which can invisibly hinder the through transport. It is said that this initiative was taken by a certain foreigner in the Jiaoji Railway. The Qingdao Municipal Government is currently negotiating with the Railway Bureau to resolve this issue satisfactorily.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Progress on the Pinghan Railway The third through transport route is the Pinghan Railway. The goods from this route are unloaded from Wuhan and loaded onto Yangtze River ships <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>for transport to various ports. The issues regarding the Pinghan Railway through transport are still under discussion. In addition to these three routes, the Jinghu, Wuchang, Huhangyong, and other routes are only embellishments. The quantity of goods on these routes is limited. Although the right to through transport also belongs to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the future transportation will still require overall planning, and the remaining goods may be allocated to privately owned shipping companies.</p>

<p>In the past, due to a lack of specialized talent in navigation and engine operation, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had to</p>
<p>hire foreign crew members for positions such as chief and second officers, and chief and second engineers. Their high salaries and excellent treatment were rare in the Chinese shipping industry. In addition to the high salaries, senior crew members were also provided with housing. During the privately owned period, even clothing was paid for by the company for washing. They had paid leave every six months, salary increases every year, travel expenses for returning home, and retirement benefits upon completion of their terms. At its peak, the company had more than 50 foreign employees, and their salaries accounted for a large portion of the company's expenses. Since becoming state-owned, the company has gradually employed domestic personnel in the navigation and engine departments, and has terminated the contracts of foreign employees whose terms have expired. Only a few remain. The total amount of retirement benefits and travel expenses paid to foreign employees by the company is staggering, and there have been disputes due to delayed payments. General Manager Liu Hongsheng believed that such complex disputes were inconvenient for both parties, so he proposed to take advantage of the company's reorganization and the addition of new ships to pay the retirement benefits of British crew members in a lump sum instead of delaying them in installments, in order to end the case early. The proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors. The amounts payable to each foreign employee are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e143">Municipal Farmers Association Requests Protection of the Historic Site of the Xian Mian Temple Shanghai High School Sells Land, Municipal Land Bureau Investigates Property Rights, Reserves Land for Agricultural Exhibition Hall <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Farmers Association has submitted a request to the Party and government agencies to stop the sale of the Xian Mian Temple by the Shanghai High School of Jiangsu Province (formerly Longmen Normal School) on Shangwen Road. The Municipal Land Bureau, upon receiving orders from the Municipal Government, immediately announced an investigation into the property rights of the temple. The Municipal Farmers Association has requested the Party to preserve the historic relics of past generations and designate them as an agricultural exhibition hall to commemorate the past. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e144">Investigation of Property Rights: Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau announced the investigation into the property rights of the Xian Mian Temple as follows: The Xian Mian Temple is located on the west side of Shanghai High School, and to the west of that is Yinggong Temple Road. According to Volume 12, Page 4 of the Shanghai County Continuation Records, there is a Huang Daopo Temple, and to the left of the temple is the Li Garden. After the garden was rebuilt into a academy, the temple was managed by the academy. The base covers 3 mu, 6 fen, 3 li, and 8 hao. In the 30th year of Guangxu (1904), the academy was rebuilt into a school, and the main gate, opera stage, and east and west viewing platforms of the temple were destroyed. A wall was built in front of the temple, with the inscription "Xian Mian Temple." Also, on Volume 12, Page 7, Yinggong Temple is located on the west side of Huang Daopo Temple, dedicated to the memory of Lang Heng, who was awarded the title of Grand Academician of the Inner Court and served as the Provincial Treasurer of Jiangsu and the Provincial Judge of Jiangsu, and who discussed the affairs of Su, Song, and Tai Dao. It was built in the 17th year of Guangxu (1891). The government authorities built temples, etc. Since the temples are recorded in the county records and are related to local ceremonies, they should be discussed by the Municipal Government, together with the Finance, Public Works, and Education Bureaus, in accordance with the request of Shanghai High School to issue certificates. Later, according to Zheng Tonghe, the principal of the school, an edict issued by Wu, the Civil Administrator of Shanghai in the first year of the Republic (1912), stated that the school could manage Ying Baoshi's private temple, which was built with private funds, according to the report submitted by Secretary-General Ying Dehong. The original property rights evidence submitted by Shanghai High School in this application for certificate renewal included two official management certificates issued by the former Shanghai County Government in March of the third year of the Republic (1914), one being No. 376, covering 2 mu, 8 fen, 6 li, and 2 hao, and the other being No. 377, covering 7 fen and 7 li 6 hao, totaling 3 mu, 6 fen, 3 li, and 8 hao. The户名 for both certificates was the Provincial Second Normal School, and the four boundaries were recorded as: east to the school, west to Yinggong Temple Road. The Xian Mian Temple and Yinggong Temple were originally located between Shanghai High School and Yinggong Temple Road. The property rights evidence seems to belong to the base of the two temples and were handled by the former Shanghai County Magistrate. However, the Xian Mian Temple is a historic relic related to the local area, and it is recorded in the county records. Currently, the Municipal Farmers Association, etc., have requested that the public property be preserved and designated as an agricultural exhibition hall. A request will be made to the Municipal Government for approval. <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<h3 id="e145">Another Request to Preserve Historic Relics: The Municipal Farmers Association submitted another request to the Municipal Party <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Headquarters yesterday. The original text stated: "Submitted for the reason that Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School has arbitrarily sold the Xian Mian Temple. A request has been submitted to stop the sale. Please close the case and present the reasons again. We respectfully request your review. It is noted that Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School published an advertisement in May of this year to sell the school site on Shangwen Road, including the Xian Mian Temple base of 3 mu, 6 fen, 3 li, and 8 hao. The Association and the Zhabei District Farmers Association have successively submitted requests to your headquarters to stop the sale, preserve the historic relics, respect public property, and allocate the land to the Association to organize an agricultural exhibition hall. We subsequently received your headquarters' Instruction No. 563. As the case has been pending for a long time, the Municipal Government has not taken any action. It is rumored that Shanghai High School has arbitrarily sold the Xian Mian Temple's public property. In order to protect the agricultural community's historic relics, the Association has no choice but to restate the reasons. As stated in the county records, the base was only managed by the academy (the current Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School is the renamed academy), and the property rights do not belong to the academy. This is very clear. How did Shanghai High School obtain the property rights of the Xian Mian Temple? If they claim that possession is the same as ownership, that is tantamount to insider theft. Therefore, in terms of property rights, Shanghai High School also has no right to arbitrarily sell the Xian Mian Temple base. Moreover, the temple is related to local historic relics, is recorded in the county records, and has historical value. There is Xian Mian Temple Lane nearby, which is historically evident. How can it be buried? The sage Huang Daopo taught the people to spin and weave, and later generations built a temple to commemorate her. All farmers admire her. Now that the temple property is arbitrarily owned by the school, and the historic relics will be destroyed, all farmers in the city are extremely indignant. The Association, without fear of cost, reiterates the previous request. We respectfully request your headquarters to forward it to the Municipal Government to quickly stop Shanghai High School from selling the Xian Mian Temple base, and allocate it to the Association for safekeeping and to organize an agricultural exhibition hall, in order to preserve the historic relics and admire the sage. The presentation is urgent and we await your orders." Addressed to: Municipal Executive Committee.</p>

<p>The Central Mint has been in operation for half a year since it began minting. The new coins it has minted have long been circulating on the market. Recently, rumors have spread in the city that some of the factory's machinery has been damaged. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the factory yesterday morning and learned that the water tower next to the factory's engine room suddenly broke down a few days ago, causing the water supply to be cut off. Therefore, the minting was temporarily suspended. Repairs are now underway and will be completed soon, and minting will resume as usual. The rumors of damaged machinery are not true.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that Toyoda Mill in this city has had plans to develop in Qingdao for two years. Recently, the joint venture operation with the Qingdao Silk Mill has matured. Mr. Akitsugu Nishikawa, the director of Toyoda, went to Qingdao at the end of July to investigate and returned to Shanghai in early August. However, it is not easy for Toyoda alone to enter and exit Qingdao due to the current situation. Therefore, they discussed a joint venture with the Qingdao Silk Mill. Nishikawa now has a concrete plan. Mr. Tantsaburo Tatsukawa of Tong Hing Mill also supports the plan and is taking the same approach as Toyoda. Other Japanese textile mills in this city also have this intention and are currently actively preparing for implementation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government, in accordance with provincial orders, is conscripting labor for river dredging. A five-year river dredging plan was previously drafted and approved by the County Political Conference and distributed to various districts for comments. The districts have successively replied to the county. A river dredging conference was convened yesterday, attended by the heads of the six districts under the county, as well as Wang Xuepeng, the head of the First Section of the County Government, Zhu Mingwu of the Technical Office, and local gentry Jiang Shijie, Kang Yongnian, etc. The conference was chaired by County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia, and the records were kept by Bi Huan. The discussion items were: (1) Should the county's five-year river dredging plan be established in general? Please discuss and decide. The resolution was: (A) The county's rivers will be dredged in five years, but the county has never had water conservancy funds. In addition to the earthwork, the costs of building dams, water drainage, surveying, etc., will be levied at five cents per mu from the first installment of land value tax each year, starting from the 23rd year, for a period of five years. This will be submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. (B) A portion of the levied mu tax should be allocated to the districts to subsidize the simultaneous dredging of branch rivers, in addition to being used to dredge the main rivers throughout the county. (C) The dredged mu tax should be kept in separate accounts by district. (D) The main rivers managed by each district should be surveyed on-site by personnel sent by the county before a decision is made after further consultation. (2) Should the county magistrate's proposal regarding dredging the Yingbin River be handled separately? Please decide. The resolution was: Reserved.</p>

<h3 id="e152">City Chamber of Commerce Continues to Request the Return of Fines for Hainan Sugar <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Hainan sugar being detained and fined, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday specially continued to request the Ministry of Finance and Customs Administration to promptly return the fine. The original telegram stated: "To the respected Ministry of Finance and Customs Administration in Nanjing: According to a joint telegram from the Ju Sheng and He Sheng sugar firms in Haikou, Hainan, regarding the case of fines for local sugar transported to Shanghai, the Inspector General of Customs has delayed resolving the matter. Yesterday, Zhi Cheng Xing, a merchant in Shanghai, acting as the fully authorized representative, went to the Inspector General of Customs to request instructions. We received a letter from the said firm stating that they did not meet the Inspector General, but were seen by Secretary Ding, who stated that he was fully aware of the situation, but that the matter could not be handled here and that they should await orders from the Customs Administration. It has been found that after the Hainan Customs fined the small merchants, various firms in this city transported sugar to Shanghai, and the Jianghai Customs verified that they were mixed with foreign sugar more than once. Light cases were fined, and serious cases were confiscated, with the Jianghai Customs verification being the standard. Even the Inspector General of Customs' telegram to the Haikou City Chamber of Commerce praised the Jianghai Customs for verifying the matter without error. Now that the small merchants' sugar has been verified by the Jianghai Customs as local sugar and has been proven in writing, the evidence is irrefutable. The Inspector General of Customs should order the return of the fine to avoid injustice to the merchants. However, the matter has been delayed for months, and recently, the excuse of not being able to handle it has been given. How can right and wrong be distinguished and fairness be shown? Because the Hainan Customs deliberately misrepresented the facts and intended to destroy local sugar, the small merchants dared not continue their business and were forced to temporarily suspend operations to await a resolution. The intangible losses are like years passing by. We respectfully request your council to maintain fairness and promptly request the Customs Administration to issue a clear order to the Inspector General of Customs, ordering the Qionghai Customs to comply and immediately return the fine paid by the small merchants in full to safeguard domestic products and ensure commercial stability. We would be extremely grateful." Based on this, it has been found that this case has been held up for months. Our chamber, after inspecting the Jianghai Customs re-verification, found that the certificate photo confirmed that it was local sugar. In July and August, we telegraphed your administration twice, requesting the Inspector General of Customs to return the fine to ensure fairness. Furthermore, in late October, Xing Juefei, the representative of the sugar merchants, presented a detailed account of the decline of Hainan local sugar and various relief measures to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting separate handling. We received your Eastern telegram in September, enclosing the photo and ordering the Inspector General of Customs to verify the matter. Now, according to the continued statement, the firm sent a representative to the Inspector General of Customs for face-to-face consultation, and the reply was that the authority does not rest with the Inspector General of Customs and that orders from your administration should be awaited for compliance. Therefore, this case does not involve the mixing of foreign sugar, which has been clearly proven. The fine should not be returned, causing the two firms to be suspended. Accordingly, we are telegraphing to request your administration to promptly instruct the Inspector General of Customs to return the aforementioned fine in full. We sincerely hope for your assistance. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows."</p>
<h3 id="e153">Jianghai Commercial Vessels Restricting the Hiring of Pilots: China Merchants Bureau Has Implemented It <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>For ships entering and leaving Jianghai waterways, some require pilots, while others do not, and the shipowners navigate themselves. Examples of the latter include Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Yantai, etc. Some ports, such as those in Japan and Dalian Bay, forcibly require pilots, and ships are not allowed to enter or leave without hiring one. Recently, some shipowners have deliberately hired pilots in areas where they are not needed, sharing the costs for personal gain. The China Merchants Bureau yesterday issued an order restricting the hiring of pilots, notifying all shipowners to comply. The original order is recorded below: Order No. 745 from the Shipping Department of the China Merchants Bureau: For the information of all concerned: It has been repeatedly ordered that ship captains of this bureau sailing along the Chinese coast are prohibited from hiring pilots. However, it has been found that some captains are outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient, which is extremely inappropriate. Therefore, it is ordered again as follows: (1) Pilots may be hired at ports where pilotage is compulsory, such as Xiamen, Guangzhou (up to the Dashihe Fort), Tianjin, Haizhou, Dapu, Hongqi, Haiphong, Dalian, and all Japanese ports. (2) Qingdao is allowed to hire tugboats to dock and depart from the pier, but it is best not to hire them if possible. (3) In all other ports, except in special circumstances that should be requested temporarily, pilots shall not be hired for the ships. The ships all have wireless stations and can be used to request instructions from the port before arrival. (4) Newly appointed captains who are unfamiliar with the conditions in the ports of various ports are allowed to hire pilots, but not more than three times. (5) If it is found that pilots are deliberately hired or pilotage fees are shared, the pilotage fees paid will be deducted from the salary, and disciplinary action will be taken for violating the order. All are expected to comply. This order is dated November 6, 21st year, Director Zhao Yuntai, Deputy Director Zhou Houkun."</p>

<h3 id="e165">Huashou Lane Rebuilt New Market: Taxpayers Association Request Cancellation of the Agreement: Donating Public Welfare and Private Benefits Landlords Are Unnecessary <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Taxpayers Chinese Association, according to the letter from the Huashou Lane Tenants Association, for the Industrial Bureau to replace the Huishancai Market base and pay a huge amount of money to the Sikebo Yanghang to exchange the Huashou Lane base, yesterday sent a letter to the Public Concession Industrial Bureau, requesting to cancel the agreement. The original letter said, "To the respected ones, according to the letter from the Huashou Lane Tenants Association, this Lane base, because the Public Concession Industrial Bureau's for Hanshan vegetable market is not enough to use, and the Sikebo Yanghang exchanged each other to rebuild the new market, I would like to ask for the strength of the conference to give assistance, and the public officials of the Industrial Bureau to understand the merchants' difficulties and generously promise mediation. The gratitude is always released. Unfortunately, it has been more than two months, and there is still no definite solution. Now, after the many contacts of our Association, the various news obtained cannot be ignored, so I will send it to Junjian again, and I hope to observe it for luck. After the Industrial Bureau exchanged the Huishancai Market base with the Sikebo Yanghang for the base of this Lane, on August 20, it disclosed this news in the bulletin. Unexpectedly, the Sikebo Yanghang had already sold the vegetable market foundation to its bank real estate trust department on August 17 and paid the payment on that day. Until August 30, the tenants of this Lane were notified to move out within the time limit. The absurdity of the handling procedure is not to say, and the failure to cut off the water repeatedly during the day, then followed by three or four secret work at midnight, and even instigated the power company to send personnel to cut off the electric lights used by the tenants of each concession at their own expense. Although the evil plan of destruction and violence has not succeeded, the sinister intention has caused the Industrial Bureau, the waterworks, and the power company to be deceived and used by it, which is enough to show that its oppression is too much, which is unbearable for people. For two months, the tenants have been living a difficult life in a shocking environment, and have not been able to live and work in peace for a moment. The spiritual sacrifice has preceded the material loss and has been misunderstood. What's more, the base of the Huishancai Market is 2 mu, 2 li, and 3 hao, with a better location and more expensive land price, worth 35,000 taels of silver per mu, which is welcomed by everyone. As for the base of this Lane, it is 3 mu, 4 fen, 2 li, and 1 hao. Only one side faces the road, and three sides are surrounded. It is sold for 15,000 taels of silver per mu, which is still reluctant. This is determined by real estate experts who are familiar with the real situation and is also recognized by those who operate real estate in Shanghai. Now, let's take this statement as absurd and unfounded, and carefully examine the valuation of the Industrial Bureau on June 16 of this year, then the Huishancai Market is worth 18,200 taels of silver per mu, and the base of this Lane is worth 14,500 taels of silver per mu. A careful review of the numbers of the two statements shows that the Industrial Bureau does not need to pay Sikebo Yanghang a huge amount of 32,000 taels of silver, so that Sikebo Yanghang can have an extra profit and have to force the relocation. If the Yanghang thinks that there will always be such unexpected surpluses in the future, it will not be immersed in the exploitation of land ownership. If everything can be as it wants, it will not be difficult to become the second Hardong, a Jewish giant in Shanghai, after a few years. If this shocking news is spread among the salt muscles of the citizens of Shanghai, it will cause panic among all the citizens, making renting more difficult than living in Chang'an. The colleagues of this association and the tenants of this Lane have always admired the Industrial Bureau's care for the citizens, as if they were their own children, which is not only admired by the people in this Lane, but also respected by the citizens of the whole community. As for Director Habai's understanding of the merchants' difficulties, there is nothing that is not obvious, and his enthusiasm for protection is the same as re-creation for the colleagues. We sincerely hope that the conference will immediately transfer the above situation to the Industrial Bureau and appeal on behalf of the public, hoping to show compassion for the difficulties and ask for relief, hoping to give up the shortcomings and take the advantages, cancel the previous case immediately, and hope to persuade the Sikebo Yanghang to still be as courteous as before the end of August, this is what we hope and look forward to, and we cannot wait for the order to arrive," etc. If the case is as described in the letter, then it is unnecessary to damage public welfare and benefit private individuals. From the standpoint of taxpayers, we should ask your Bureau not to be deceived by private landlords again and firmly cancel the agreement, which is a method that benefits both the public and private. According to the previous information, we should send a letter to check and handle it. This is addressed to the Director of the Shanghai Public Concession Industrial Bureau.</p>
<p>The Taxpayers Association also replied to the letter from the Huashou Lane Tenants Association, saying, "In response to your letter of November 4, the price of the Huishancai Market is higher than the price of the Huashou Lane base. The Public Concession Industrial Bureau exchanged it with a huge fee, which is not cost-effective, etc. We have sent a letter to the Bureau to check and handle it. It is said that Director Habai is fair and selfless and can cancel the agreement. Accordingly, we are replying in a letter, hoping that you will check and handle it. This is addressed to the Huashou Lane Tenants Association.</p>

<p>Li Kunxin's home at No. 6, Lane 299, Yuezhou Road, was robbed of gold and silver jewelry worth 187 yuan on the afternoon of the 1st of this month at about 4 o'clock. It was reported by the Huishan Police Station. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives arrested five robbers, Zhang Jinfeng, Ye Afu, He Jifen, Shen Jinyuan, and Zhang Jinbao, in Room 13 of the Xinfake Hotel at No. 36 Edou Road, and confiscated the original stolen ornaments. A pistol and 48 bullets were found in Zhang Jinfeng's home at No. 82 Yad Road, and they were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, the police detectives were still waiting in the hotel. A Ningbo man, Ye Rongyu, went to the room to ask where Shen Jinyuan was and was arrested and taken to the police station. He denied robbing the Li family's property on Yuezhou Road, saying that he went to the room to borrow silver from Shen Jinyuan. The police brought Shen thief out and pointed out that he was watching outside the door at that time. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Ye Rongyu to the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the previous situation and asked for a postponement and combined interrogation with Zhang Jinfeng, etc., to question the defendant's confession. At that time, he went to the hotel to find Xiao Chongming (namely Shen Jinyuan) to temporarily move one yuan to him, and was detained, and Shen pointed out that I was watching the wind in the Yuezhou Road robbery case, which was a false accusation, and asked for identification. Judge Liu Tangui ordered to be returned to custody and tried together with Zhang Jinfeng, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Yang Shousheng Kidnapping Case: Rickshaw Puller Dies from Severe Injuries <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 5:00 PM, several kidnappers went to the "Morimura Automobile Company," a Japanese-owned business located on Yalü Road in Hongkou, and hired a car with Concession license plate number 18066 and Chinese Area license plate number 4221. The driver, a local named Cao Hougen, drove the car to the Daxilu area in West Shanghai. There, the kidnappers forced the driver out, tied him up, and abandoned him by the roadside. One of the kidnappers, familiar with driving, took over and drove the car to the vicinity of the City God Temple in the Chinese area of Nanshi. They then kidnapped Yang Shousheng, a Suzhou native residing at No. 4 Linxian Lane, Guangqi Road, who previously worked at the stock exchange. They forced him into the car and sped away. As the kidnappers were driving away with the abducted victim at 6:50 PM, they passed through Fulu Li Road in the French Concession, heading east. Near the entrance of No. 602 Fulu Li Road, a rickshaw puller, around 50 years old, was slowly pulling an empty rickshaw in front of the car. In their panicked haste, the kidnappers' car, unable to avoid him, sped forward and struck the rickshaw puller, causing a head injury that rendered him unconscious. After the accident, the kidnappers' car traveled about ten zhang (approximately 33 meters) before stopping. The kidnappers then took the victim out of the car and calmly fled. When the patrol police arrived and investigated, the kidnappers had already escaped, leaving only the empty car abandoned on the road. The police immediately reported the incident to the police station. The police station had already received a report of the car robbery. After receiving the report from the patrol police, the police chief immediately dispatched officers to take the injured rickshaw puller to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They also sent people to retrieve the car abandoned by the kidnappers and bring it back to the police station. However, the injured rickshaw puller was unable to speak due to the severity of his injuries, making it impossible to ascertain his name or address. He died shortly after being admitted to the hospital. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang autopsy center. Yesterday morning, the French Concession police station reported the incident to the Second Special District Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Wang Ren at 10:30 AM to conduct an autopsy at the center. The autopsy confirmed that the unidentified male body had died from a head injury caused by a car accident. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuantang for photographs, encoffining, and burial, pending identification by relatives. The French Concession police station's traffic division will investigate the driver responsible for the accident and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>The "Huizhou Daily," founded on the Double Tenth Festival last year, has pure and just opinions and is distributed throughout the provinces. The newspaper's editor-in-chief, Bi Zhuojun, recently came to Shanghai. According to him, Huizhou, a part of Anhui province, is a paradise. However, since the spread of "red pills" (heroin), the society and economy have become increasingly impoverished. Fortunately, Liu Cheng粹, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner, and Wang Moxia, the Deputy Security Commander, have shown resolute determination in eradicating drugs. They have cracked down on more than a dozen "red pill" manufacturing facilities, executed five or six "red pill" traffickers, and the harm of "red pills" has been extinguished. In addition to their efforts in drug eradication, Liu and Wang have also dedicated themselves to relieving unemployment and revitalizing the rural economy. Recently, they have been planning to develop Huangshan Mountain to create a source of economic prosperity. In addition, the Huizhou-Hangzhou Highway has been completed and will be open to traffic on the 15th of this month.

<h3 id="e172">Gang Members Punished for Extortion <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Han Yougen, a Ningbo native and employee of the Yongxing Fish Shop in the Hengtong Fish Market at No. 24 Xiaodongmenwai Street, French Concession, was forcibly extorted of 20 yuan on the afternoon of the 1st of this month by Liu Along (aka Mapizi Along), a local rogue, in collusion with his gang members Di Jundao, Zhao Hongbao, Shen Tianlu, etc. They forced him into Room 19 of the Yuedong Hotel at No. 23 Minguo Road, Dagu Road. Han reported the incident to the Xiaodongmen French Concession police station, and officers Sui Wenzhi and Yin Bingnan arrested Liu and the other three. They were brought to the Second Special District Court yesterday. First, the police station lawyer, Gu Shouxi, presented the case, charging them with intimidation. Then, the plaintiff, Han Yougen, stated that on that day, as he was passing Minguo Road, Liu pulled him into Room 19 of the Yuedong Hotel and forcibly demanded 50 yuan as compensation for mediating the matter of Di Jundao's sister. When Han refused, they took out four sharp axes from under the bed to intimidate him. Han, having no other choice, paid them the 20 yuan he had on him and promised to pay the remaining 30 yuan the next day before they released him. Feeling resentful, he reported the incident to the police station, requesting an investigation. The defendant, Liu Along, claimed that the plaintiff, Han Yougen, was having an affair with a female tea server named Guiying at the Fuan Amusement Park. Guiying's former lover, Di Jundao, found out about it and argued with Han. Han then entrusted the defendant to mediate the matter and voluntarily offered 20 yuan to treat them to a meal. He denied that they had extorted him. Di Jundao claimed that the plaintiff had an affair with his lover, and he confronted him about it. Han voluntarily offered to pay for a meal and did not extort him. Zhao Hongbao and Shen Tianlu testified that Liu Along had invited them to help with the matter. Afterwards, Han paid for them to have a late-night meal. While they were eating crab and drinking old wine in the room, the police arrived to arrest them. If they had extorted him, they would not have been so bold as to stay in the room and eat without running away. Furthermore, according to the patrol officer's report, no axes were found during the arrest. Finally, the police lawyer argued that the defendants used violence and coercion to force the victim to hand over his property, committing the crime stipulated in Article 318 of the Criminal Code, and requested that they be severely punished according to the law. Judge Li examined the testimonies and ruled that the four defendants, including Liu Along, should each be sentenced to 24 days of detention, with Shen Tianlu's sentence suspended for two years.</p>

<h3 id="e173">3,900 Yuan Fraud Case Involving Altered Checks Using Chemical Solution; Japanese National Guo Jiangpu and Li Jiaping Collaborate; American Lawyer Olmen Falls for the Scam; Case Cracked Recently After Five Months <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>On June 12th of this year, a Japanese national named Guo Jiangpu, using the alias Deng Tong, suddenly visited the office of American lawyer Olmen, claiming that a man named Li Jiaping owed him money and had repeatedly failed to repay it. He requested the lawyer to send a letter on his behalf to demand payment. After accepting the commission, Attorney Olmen sent a letter to Li (who was staying in Room 323 of the Zhongnan Hotel), urging him to settle the debt as soon as possible. Upon receiving the letter, Li immediately went to the attorney's office, stating that he was unable to repay the full amount and would first pay 100 yuan as interest. He then took out a check for 100 yuan from the Asia-East Bank and gave it to Attorney Olmen before leaving. Attorney Olmen then instructed someone to cash the check at the bank and temporarily deposit the cash at the Datong Bank, with which he had dealings. The next day, Guo arrived, and Attorney Olmen informed him of the progress. Guo stated that he would use the 100 yuan for other purposes and requested a check to withdraw the money. Guo obtained the check and then went to Li's residence. They had already succeeded in the initial stage of their fraudulent scheme and proceeded with the second step. Guo used a chemical solution to wipe away the number "100" on the check. After a night, the number disappeared completely without a trace. Li then altered the check, filling in the English number "3,900." Li had dealings with the Asia-East Bank, so he sent the altered check to the Asia-East Bank for collection from the Datong Bank. The Asia-East Bank did not suspect any alteration, and the Datong Bank did not detect any flaws, believing that the signature of "Olmen" was genuine. They immediately paid the full amount to the Asia-East Bank. At this time, Li Jiaping was unaware that the money had been cashed. Feeling guilty for his deceit, he dared not inquire rashly. He then devised a method of reconnaissance. He still had 20 yuan deposited at the Asia-East Bank, so he signed a check for 100 yuan and sent a tea servant from a certain hotel to cash it. If he received the full amount, it would mean that the money from the Datong Bank had been cashed. Otherwise, his fraudulent scheme would have been exposed. While he was hesitating, the servant returned, and he received the full amount. Overjoyed, he rushed to Guo to celebrate and, on the following day, drew a check for 3,700 yuan to withdraw all his remaining deposits from the Asia-East Bank. They divided the loot and spent it lavishly. When the Datong Bank discovered the fraud, they reported it to the police station, requesting an investigation. However, both Jiang and Li had already vanished without a trace. The incident occurred five months ago and remained unsolved. However, this pair of swindlers, colluding for ill gain, recently reappeared in Shanghai. Li had changed his name to Yang Rendan and was hiding in Room 526 of the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in order to find an opportunity to work. This was discovered by Zhao Bingkun, the Chinese detective chief of the General Patrol Office, and the Western detective Pratt, who launched a rigorous investigation. They arrested a suspect last Friday. Yesterday, the two swindlers went to the office of lawyer F. Crook in Yuanmingyuan Road No. 22, attempting to pull the same trick. They were then arrested one after another. Since Guo was of Japanese nationality, he was transferred to the Japanese consulate for interrogation. Yang Rendan was transferred to the First Special District Court yesterday morning for investigation. Yang is a Fujian native, only 26 years old. According to the police lawyer Ru Baoyi, the suspect had confessed to altering the check at the police station. He was charged under Article 224 of the Criminal Code, requesting a new date for the trial to be combined with the previously arrested suspect. Judge Feng briefly interrogated the defendant and ordered him to be detained and heard on Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Road Bureau's Attention: Baohuashan Longchang Temple; Special Order for Engineering Office to Inspect the Route from Longtan to Longchang Temple, Which is Related to Attracting Travelers on Both Routes <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Road Bureau previously considered Longchang Temple on Baohua Mountain as a scenic spot along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. They ordered the Engineering Office to study a route from Longtan Station to Longchang Temple. Engineer Yin Zhilu and personnel from the Traffic Office went to inspect the route and reported to the bureau. The route is related to attracting tourists on both routes. The following is an excerpt from their report. On November 25th, they walked from Longtan Station via Routes A, B, C, and D to Longchang Temple on Baohua Mountain. The distance from Route A to Route C is 11 li (approximately 5.5 kilometers), and the distance from Route C to Route D, where Longchang Temple is located, is 7 li (approximately 3.5 kilometers). The entire route is 18 li (approximately 9 kilometers). The width is about 4 to 12 feet. The road is paved with either bluestone or bricks, so it is very flat. Although it has been in disrepair for many years, walking is not difficult. This road is actually the main road from Longtan to Baohua Mountain. On the return trip, they took a four-person sedan chair from Longchang Temple, changing to Routes D, C, E, and A to reach the station, which is about 15 li (approximately 7.5 kilometers). Although this route is about 3 li (approximately 1.5 kilometers) shorter than the previous route, it is rugged and difficult to walk on. The section from Route C to Route E is very narrow, and there are not many brick-paved roads, but one can barely manage. However, at Route E, the winding path is difficult to navigate. There is a steep cliff for about a li (approximately 0.5 kilometers), making it difficult to cross even by sedan chair, and walking is also very dangerous. According to the sedan chair carriers, one can still travel on this road from Baohua to the station, but from the station to Baohua, one must take the Route A-B-C-D road. After investigation, there are many protruding rocks (limestone) along the way in Route E, which greatly hinders travelers. Removing them completely would cost no less than 400-500 yuan, but even if they are removed temporarily, the soil will be washed away by water in a few years, and the mountain valley will inevitably protrude again, which will be of no use. Even if the rocks are removed, the steepness of the slopes will make walking difficult. If the road is rerouted around the mountain to make it slightly flatter, it would cost no less than 2,000-3,000 yuan. In summary, since there is already a main road from Longtan to Baohua, there seems to be no need to find another route. Furthermore, the temple was named Longchang in the Ming Dynasty, renamed Huiju Temple in the Qing Dynasty, and now has reverted to its old name of Longchang Temple. It is located near the Baohua Mountain Ridge, winding along the side of the mountain for about 4 li (approximately 2 kilometers) to reach the temple gate. It is paved with bricks, quite wide, and lined with towering trees and flowing streams, making it a very secluded and beautiful place. The temple has about hundreds of rooms, which are neat and clean, with little noise. The surrounding bamboo forest is very elegant. There are about 100-200 resident monks. In spring and autumn, they hold ceremonies and set up altars, attracting many tourists. The temple's land produces about 5,000 dan (approximately 500,000 kilograms) of rice per year, and the mountain firewood can be sold for 1,000-2,000 yuan. The temple has 20 special rattan sedan chairs, carried by the temple workers, to pick up and drop off visitors. The fare from the temple to the station is 4,000 yuan, which is about 1.45 silver yuan. The Longtan Town has the Dingshui Temple, which is a lower temple of Longchang Temple. If the stationmaster notifies the lower temple one day in advance, the temple can send sedan chairs to the station to pick up visitors the next day. If visitors want to stay longer, they can also stay at the temple. Therefore, there is no inconvenience for visitors.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Adding Heroin to Cigarette Tobacco; Burning and Smoking for Pleasure; Wu Jisheng is Truly a Peril to Society <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the French Concession authorities have been strictly investigating and cracking down on illegal opium dens and heroin dens within the concession. Even more recently, some ruffians have been providing morphine, heroin, and other drugs for people to smoke. Wu Jisheng, a 35-year-old man from Anhui, had a wild idea and established a heroin smoking venue in the living room downstairs at No. 41 Ruifuli Street, Zilaihuo Street. Compared to opium and heroin, heroin is even more harmful. The method of smoking it is to mix the tobacco from cigarettes with heroin powder in a small pipe, burn it, and smoke it. The effects are very rapid, providing an immediate rush, several times more potent than opium or heroin. Therefore, many addicts are happy to indulge in it, and Wu's daily income is very high. This was discovered by French Concession detective Wu, Wat Ho-tai (transliteration), Chinese detective Wang Ronggui, and patrol officers Lu Songlin and Chen Tinghuai. They raided the place on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and arrested Wu, along with his assistant Wang Arong and customers Xu Zhitao, Li Yuhai, Yao Baosheng, Hu Zhanying, Dong Afa, Xu Shoushen, Zhu Baolin, Shi Guangrui, Xu Changhai, Jin Jiapin, You Mengyun, Wang Fuchang, Chen Hebao, Wang Qingting, Li Wenting, Cao Zhao, and Chen Zhu, nineteen men and women in total. Eight pipes, a small amount of tobacco, and three packets of heroin powder were seized on the spot and taken to the police station. Wu confessed that he bought the heroin from Du Yougen. The detectives then arrested Du, who admitted to selling drugs without hesitation. They were all transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning for investigation. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, charging them under Articles 6, 10, and 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. The defendants admitted to selling drugs to addicts for their pleasure. Judge Li verified the confessions and ordered them to be detained pending sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Foreign Merchants Exaggerated Price of Aristolochia Root; Profit by Six or Seven Times; Westerner Sends Letter to Newspaper Seeking Opinions from Chinese Merchants <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from a Westerner, Rizui, stating that Aristolochia root is a root of a shrub produced in the northern Kashmir region of India, on mountain slopes at altitudes of 4,000 to 5,000 feet. In recent years, China's demand has increased, with about 2,000 dan imported annually. However, because it is rare elsewhere, the Kashmir government has designated it as a national monopoly, collecting it from the people each year and selling it to the highest bidder. The purchase price is usually between 15 and 20 rupees per maund (approximately 82 pounds, equivalent to 0.615 dan in Chinese weight). In addition, the cost of transporting the goods from the Kashmir government warehouse to various ports in China is about 12 rupees per maund. Therefore, the cost of delivering to Chinese ports is no more than 32 rupees per maund, equivalent to no more than 65 yuan per dan in Chinese weight. Even if the Kashmir government and the purchasers each earn a profit of 100%, the selling price in Hong Kong and China should not exceed 130 yuan per dan. However, the price charged to Chinese merchants in the past ten years has often been between 350 and 480 yuan per dan, resulting in a profit of six or seven times. Based on China's annual import of 2,000 dan, the total cost of the goods is about 700,000 yuan. If the legal maximum value is used, it should only cost 260,000 yuan. China is paying an additional 500,000 yuan for this item each year. Only China wants to buy this item; other countries do not need it much. The reason why these merchants can obtain such extraordinary profits is that Chinese merchants do not know the cost. At a time when China is under construction, the financial resources of the people should be conserved as much as possible. If the chambers of commerce in various cities were to collect detailed information about this item and publish it from time to time, so that Chinese merchants can cooperate with each other to lower the price to a reasonable level, at least 500,000 yuan could be saved each year.</p>

<p>At 8:40 AM yesterday morning, a gunshot suddenly rang out at the Nanshi South Railway Station, which was in the midst of selling tickets, causing chaos and sending passengers scattering. Police officers from the station and officers from the Chenjiaqiao Police Station of the Second District General Office arrived quickly after hearing the sound and found three or four people holding down a short-clothed young man and a young woman. They were all arrested, and the truth was revealed. The details are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Xu Hanwen Comes to Shanghai: A Kidnapping Case Occurred in Dayao Luo Xiang Area, Jiashan County, with a Farmer as the Victim <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The victim, Meng Guisheng, was kidnapped in Dayao Luo Xiang area in Jiaxing County. After the incident, the county government ordered its departments to solve the case within a certain time limit. However, two months passed without any progress. It was only recently that Su Songfu, the captain of the investigation team of the Fifth Detachment of the First Brigade of the Zhejiang Water Police, discovered that the main suspect, Xu Hanwen (original name Geng Shoushen), had fled to Shanghai and was hiding in Room 56 of the Dongfang Apartment on Beile Road, French Concession, waiting for family members to contact him for ransom negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Posing as the Victim's Family: After Captain Su Learned of this, he immediately reported it to his superiors. He led five investigators, each carrying firearms, to Shanghai to track down the suspect <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>at the previous day. At the same time, he secretly instructed informants to investigate Geng's movements. He was then informed that the suspect was indeed living with his concubine, Zhang, in the Dongfang Apartment, and requested immediate arrest. Captain Su then ordered people to pose as the victim's family members and met with the suspect at around 9:00 AM yesterday, using various excuses to lure the suspect to the Wangchun Teahouse in the South Railway Station in order to temporarily escort the suspect onto the train to Jiashan.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Pretending to Urinate and Fleeing: Upon arriving at the teahouse, Captain Su and the accompanying investigators suddenly appeared and attempted to handcuff the suspect <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The suspect, realizing that he had been tricked, tried to escape. He feigned composure and asked to urinate once. Captain Su agreed to his request, but fearing that the suspect was cunning, he ordered two investigators to accompany him. However, when the suspect reached the open space in front of the station, he suddenly broke into a run.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Apprehended After Gunshot: After the suspect started running, he crossed the road <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>At that time, trams and cars were coming and going. The investigators also gave up their lives to chase after him, directly chasing him to the Shunji Lane entrance of Chenjiaqiao. Seeing that the situation was not good, the two investigators drew their pistols and fired a shot. Police officers Xu Yuchun, Jin Zhongfu, and Chen Changlin from the Chenjiaqiao Police Station of the Second District General Office, as well as detectives Yang Jinchen and Zhou Jizhen from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team stationed at the station, all heard the alarm and assisted in the pursuit, and he was intercepted.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Confesses Name is Geng Shoushen: After the suspect was arrested, he was first taken to the police station and immediately transferred to the Second District General Office. After <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Director Li interrogated him in detail, Captain Su briefly recounted the events. When questioned, the suspect gave his name as Geng Shoushen (aka Xu Hanwen), 22 years old, from Anhui. He previously served in the Independent Artillery Regiment of the 15th Army. He was discharged in Nanjing and then went to Jiashan to serve as a platoon leader in the militia and the head of the reserve training class. He admitted to knowing about the kidnapping of farmer Meng Guisheng, but claimed that he did not know the whereabouts of the victim.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Qian Shuzhen's Testimony: Director Li then questioned the concubine <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>years old, has been following Geng for three years. She came to Shanghai this time to find work and did not know anything about the kidnapping. After the interrogation, Director Li immediately instructed Captain Su that Su had come to Shanghai to arrest the suspect without reporting to the district beforehand, and the procedure was deficient. He ordered him to immediately return to Jia and complete the official documents before returning to Shanghai to take custody of the suspect. Meanwhile, he submitted the suspect and others to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>City Public Security Bureau Inspectors Dai Yongqing and Kong Guangnan, at approximately 8 PM the night before, apprehended a man surnamed Cheng from Siyang at Xiaodongmen. Under interrogation at the bureau, Cheng stated he was 25 years old and dealt in second-hand goods. He also confessed that his accomplices were hiding in Room 33 of the Zhongxin Hotel at 90 Qujiang Lane, Hankou Road in the Public Concession. Dai and Kong immediately reported this to the</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Old Zha Police Station, requesting assistance. The station chief dispatched Western Detective Sha Haofu and Chinese Detective No. 149, who proceeded to Zhongxin Hotel at approximately 10 PM that night. There, they apprehended three more accomplices: Ou, a Cantonese; Zhang, from Shanxi; and Yuan, from Chongming. Subsequently, they went to the upper floor of Wu Senxing Dim Sum Shop at 40 Longmen Road, confiscating two Mauser rifles, five handguns, and 157 rounds of ammunition. All were taken to the police station and detained. At approximately 6 AM the next morning, Yuan confessed that another accomplice was hiding at 88 Sande Lane, Chengdu Road. Chinese and Western detectives secretly proceeded there and searched the premises, confiscating a large quantity of military equipment, including four handguns, ten toxic gas water vapor guns, over a thousand rounds of ammunition, and two hand grenades. They also arrested one man, one woman, and two children found inside the house, taking them back to the police station for separate detention. At approximately 9 AM yesterday morning, the police station first escorted Ou, Zhang, and Yuan, along with the seven handguns and 157 rounds of ammunition, to the High Court Second Branch for instruction. Judge Jiang Shuzi ascended the bench for a joint interrogation. At the request of a detective from the City Public Security Bureau, the three defendants were transferred for investigation and to apprehend other members of the gang. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, then stood up and detailed the above situation, stating that due to time constraints, the police station had not yet investigated the man and woman arrested this morning and would therefore be presenting the case tomorrow morning. However, given the large quantity of military weapons confiscated in this case, and the recent assassinations in the concession, it was likely that the defendants had committed crimes within the concession. Therefore, the police station intended to send the confiscated handguns to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Firearms Inspection Department to determine if they had been used in any crimes. He requested a three-day extension and asked that the request for transfer by the Public Security Bureau be temporarily suspended. When questioned, Ou stated that a friend surnamed Fang had asked him to gather at the Zhongxin Hotel to play mahjong and that he knew nothing about the military weapons or who rented the house on Longmen Road. Zhang also stated that he went to Room 33 of the Zhongxin Hotel to find a fellow townsman and denied possessing any military weapons. When questioned, Yuan confessed that while he knew about the guns and ammunition, they were not intended for use by communists but were for robbery. He also admitted to robbing a cigarette paper shop on Yongxing Road, Zhabei on the 2nd of this month and stated that he had met Cheng at the Yong'an Cotton Mill in Caojiadu. According to Cheng, he was from Siyang, 25 years old, and dealt in second-hand goods. He had been a colleague of Yuan's at the Yong'an Cotton Mill, which is how they knew each other. One day, he encountered Yuan on the road, who told him that he lived at 40 Longmen Road and had rented Room 33 at the Zhongxin Hotel, inviting him to visit whenever he was free. This is how he knew Yuan's whereabouts. He knew there were guns and ammunition hidden on Longmen Road but did not know who they belonged to. He only knew that he had gone to Zhabei to rob with Yuan on the 2nd of this month and knew nothing else. After reviewing the confessions, the judge noted that the defendants had admitted to being thieves. Since the police station had requested a postponement for further investigation, this was granted. The judge instructed that the three defendants be detained for further interrogation next Friday and informed the police lawyer, Li Zhishan, that if the defendants were confirmed to be members of a gang during the postponement, he should directly request the First Special District Court to take over the case.</p>

<p>Shen Youtian, a Cantonese man residing on Keming Road, Zhabei, had an adopted daughter named Shen Huiqun, 19 years old, who had studied at Guangzhao School. She was unusually short, resembling a 13 or 14-year-old girl, but her looks were outstanding and charming, capable of moving people's affection. She enjoyed socializing and dancing, and therefore often made friends with the opposite sex. Shen strictly forbade this, leading to a rift between father and daughter. On September 12, she ran away from home. A young man named Chen Qingyun, also Cantonese and a modern student, had known Huiqun in the past and went to find her. Chen rented Room 29 in Jiande Apartment with Huiqun, and they made vows to each other. However, Shen Youtian, after losing his daughter, was unaware of this situation and searched everywhere for her. He reported this to the Fifth District First Precinct, and officer Zhu Zeming was dispatched to arrest the couple and transfer them to the District Court. Shen Huiqun was taken back by her father, while the prosecutor cited Article 257, prosecuting Chen Qingyun for seducing a woman under the age of twenty. Yesterday, Judge Lu Renji opened the court for trial. The defendant retained lawyer Tian Heming for defense. Chen Qingyun stated that Shen Huiqun was a dancer whom he had met at a dance hall. Because she had no place to live, he let her stay at Jiande Apartment. She rented and lived there herself, and he had no relations with her. He was arrested for visiting and chatting, etc. Officer Zhu Zeming stated that on October 21, at 2 AM, after receiving a report from Shen Youtian, the precinct chief sent him to Room 29 of Jiande Apartment. He saw the woman sitting on the edge of the bed and the man leaning on the table. There was also a man and woman who said they were relatives of the plaintiff and were there to monitor. He then brought them back to the precinct. Shen Youtian stated that he was a collection officer stationed at Shenxin No. 9 Factory of the Ministry of Finance's Bureau of Unified Taxation. Shen Huiqun was born on May 25 of the Republic of China Year 3. She had previously studied and was not a dancer, but she liked to play. On October 12, she left with Mr. Wang, a former teacher, and did not return for many days. He found her at a friend's place surnamed Li, who eventually led him to Jiande Apartment. After questioning the tea house worker, he reported to the police and waited to apprehend them. (Question) Did your daughter claim at the prosecutor's office that she wanted three hundred yuan? (Answer) This was a proposal for reconciliation by relatives; I have no such intention. Shen Huiqun stated that she was twenty years old, born on May 25. Shen Youtian was her father, and she had a mother, four brothers, and one sister at home. Chen Qingyun met her at a farewell banquet for someone surnamed Li going to Nanyang. Afterward, he often came to visit. Because her father had a bad temper, she left home. Having no money, she went to the Bazilu Dance Research Association to borrow four or five yuan from Chen Qingyun, and he rented a room at Jiande Apartment. From this, a relationship developed. After three or four days, both parties discussed marriage and she wrote a letter to her parents to notify them and discuss it, but she did not know if they had received it. In August and September, she did work as a dancer at the Lafayette Dance Hall for three or four days, earning two or three yuan a day. However, she was not dedicated to this profession; she simply liked this pastime, so she quit later. She was very willing to marry Chen Qingyun, etc. The tea house worker, Li Xingsheng, also came to court to testify that the two had indeed been staying together. After much debate, the judge announced that the debate was over and a verdict would be delivered later. The defendant was remanded into custody.</p>

<p>—Six Houses Destroyed, Fire Burning for Two Hours—</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:40 PM, a fire broke out on Fuyou Road in the city, burning for two hours and destroying six houses. Fortunately, no one was injured. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Fire Circumstances - Fuyou Road in the city, from Small World westward, is a concentration of foreign jade shops <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the</p>
<p>Yichang Foreign Jade Shop at 405 Fuyou Road, owned by Lu Jinqing,</p>
<p>suddenly caught fire. Because foreign jade uses rosin as a raw material, the fire immediately broke through the roof and spread rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Six Houses Destroyed - After the fire broke out, the Zihua Street Fire Brigade was nearby and quickly arrived at the scene, but because the western section of Fuyou Road was narrow and the fire was intense, in addition to spreading to the Yongxingzhai Foreign Jade Shop at 403, owned by Zhou Yongde, and the Gong Yuanshun Cigarette Paper Shop at 409, it also affected the Fanyongji Paint Shop at 398 on the opposite side, the Daxin Wool Store at 396, and also spread to Wujianong, No. 2, Lanes 6 and 7, destroying a total of six houses. <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<h3 id="e190">Fire Starter Arrested - When the fire broke out, the relevant First Precinct of the Second Public Security District was very close. Precinct Chief Shen Zhenhua, upon hearing the alarm, immediately led his entire squad of police officers to the scene to suppress the fire, immediately arresting the fire starter Lu Jinqing and taking him to the precinct for questioning. Lu admitted to starting the fire and was immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau for review. <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<h3 id="e191">Director Pan Visits Rose Garden New Village <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>City Education Director Pan Gongzhan has spared no effort in promoting new village projects. He translated "Garden Cities of To-morrow," a book about British new villages, which is a valuable reference for those in China interested in social reform movements. Recently, a new village was built on the side of the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, with hundreds of acres of land and named Rose Garden New Village. He greatly praised the society's plan and visited the site of the new village yesterday. According to Mr. Pan,</p>
<h3 id="e192">Thoughts After the Visit Mr. Pan said, "The main condition for building a new village is to choose a good environment. Only then does the new village have meaning. The village is located in a natural suburb, attached to the side of the city, <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<h3 id="e193">Good Environment pure and simple customs, enough to cultivate body <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>and mind, and also beneficial to children's education. The second requirement is</p>
<h3 id="e194">Complete Facilities - The village plan is very thorough. In <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>terms of culture, the village has a library, kindergarten, elementary school, sports field, family craft room, etc. Public places are available for meetings, lectures, exhibitions, etc. Household items such as</p>
<h3 id="e195">Water and Electricity Supply - are very complete, and traffic guarantees are also <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>thoughtfully designed.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The most commendable thing is that the cost is transparent and open, and <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>a public production and public consumption method is adopted. The village has gardens and pastures that can provide public consumption.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Unfortunately, the village initially only built fifty houses, <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>and half of them have already been reserved. Shanghai's urban population is over three million, and even if only one in a thousand wants to live in the new village, there would be three thousand people, which is a pity that supply cannot meet demand. I sincerely hope that the members of the society can continue to work hard, expand and promote, which will not only be good news for housing, but also contribute to the future of society.</p>

<p>Wang Jinxi, a local of Shanghai, opened the Sanxin Soda Company at 2018 Haig Road, Xujiahui, but recently the business has been slow, so it closed down the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning at approximately 11:50 AM, Wang and others were settling accounts, preparing to pay off the soda company's debts, when four robbers speaking a Jiangbei accent and wearing blue cloth short coats suddenly arrived. They arrived in car number 18478 from Xiang Sheng Car Company. After getting out of the car on Rue Pere Robert, French Concession, they walked into Wang's shop. Two robbers held guns and robbed the place, while two robbers acted as lookouts outside. They robbed two hundred and eighteen yuan in silver dollars, twelve yuan in small bills, and sixty-five jiao in small change, fleeing eastward towards the wasteland of the French Concession. After seeing the robbers leave, Wang followed and shouted "Robbers!" and blew his police whistle frantically. Yang Zhongjin, a detective from the Second Precinct of the Sixth District, was passing by and, together with a guard from Yangjiaku No. 15, chased after them. At the same time, Hu Zongxi, a detective from the City Public Security Bureau residing at 2024, had just returned home from work. Upon hearing about the robbery, he also helped chase after them. The robbers fled to Rue Pere Robert, French Concession, intending to return in their original car, but the driver, Zhu Deshan, suspected them and locked the car, going elsewhere to buy cigarettes to observe the situation. The robbers, unable to escape, had no choice but to get out of the car and flee in all directions, opening fire on Detectives Yang and Hu to resist arrest. Yang and others also drew their guns and returned fire. The nearby French Concession police station on Rue Tong responded to the gunfire, dispatching a large number of detectives to surround the area. They chased them to the Pan Yunji Construction Company on Rue Canton, where they finally captured the bandits Yang Huaicheng from Jingjiang and Liu Zaishan from Qingjiang. The other two bandits escaped. They confiscated a handgun at the scene, and over twenty yuan in stolen money was found on their bodies. They were taken back to the police station and temporarily detained by Detective Yang in the Second Precinct of the Sixth District, pending the capture of the two remaining bandits, before proceeding with the interrogation.</p>

<p>To the Editor: In the November 6th issue of your newspaper, a piece of local news reported a rumor about paper merchants resisting goods, involving our society using enemy paper. After reading it, we were greatly surprised. The paper used by our society is all purchased from Xingji Paper Firm, Yuanhe Paper Firm, Yicheng Paper Firm, and Fufeng Paper Firm, and there are invoices to prove it. Moreover, each invoice clearly states the source of the goods, and we have never used enemy paper. Although our society is a merchant, we do not lag behind others in patriotism. Moreover, the current market price of newsprint in rolls is lower than that of enemy paper, so how could we abandon the cheap price and purchase the expensive enemy paper? This rumor is self-defeating. The matter concerns the reputation of merchants, so please correct it to clarify the facts and correct the rumors. This would be a virtue and convenience. Sincerely, The New Culture Bookstore of Shanghai, November 7th</p>

<h3 id="e220">President of Northeastern University Wang Zhuoran Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to Wait to Meet Minister of Finance Kong to Discuss Funding <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Northeastern University was originally located in Shenyang. After the September 18th Incident occurred and the border city fell, the university moved to Beiping. Zhang Xueliang continued to serve as president. This spring, Zhang resigned and went abroad, and Wang Zhuoran, the secretary-general of the university, took over as acting president and spared no effort in carrying out the university's affairs. During the Fifth National Games held in Beijing on the Double Tenth Festival, Wang led the heroic sons and daughters of the Northeast south to participate, which was highly praised by all parties. After the closing of the National Games, Wang immediately returned to Beiping with the Northeastern athletes. Wang took care of the university affairs slightly and then took a train south, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning. According to reports, the university currently has more than 1,100 students, and plans to recruit new students next summer. The university's funding was previously set at 24,000 yuan per month by the Ministry of Education, but the Ministry of Finance only allocated 8,000 yuan due to the central government's financial difficulties, which made the university feel stretched. Now that the newly appointed Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has taken office, I have come to Shanghai specifically to wait to meet him to discuss clearing the arrears in funding, and also to discuss the future plans of the university. Once things are settled, I will return to Beiping.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Inauguration of Xianzhou Cooperative Library, Founded by the Chinese Cooperative Society <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>When discussing the cooperative movement in our country, one must first mention Mr. Xue Xianzhou, a pioneer in cooperation. Mr. Xue returned to China from Europe around 1919 and immediately advocated the cooperative movement. To this day, most of the important figures leading the cooperative movement in the country are disciples of Xue. However, Xue unfortunately passed away in 1927. His spirit of advocating the cooperative movement has contributed to the party and the country and will be immortal. The Shanghai Chinese Cooperative Society, in order to commemorate the pioneer of cooperation and to encourage all members to work harder in the cooperative movement, specially founded a cooperative specialized library. Chen Guofu, Guo Renyuan, Zhang Dingzhi, and Wang Shiying were recommended as construction committee members, and it was decided to build the latest style library building on the society's base at Majia Alley, ZiWu Road, Nanjing. Construction began in May of this year and will be fully completed in mid-month. It is named the Xianzhou Mr. Memorial Cooperative Library, abbreviated as Xianzhou Cooperative Library. Recently, because the construction of the library is about to be completed, Wang Shiying, the director of preparation, has been actively preparing for internal equipment, library operations plans, and the solicitation or purchase of books. It is heard that the total construction cost of the library is in the range of 20,000 yuan, but a huge amount of funds is still needed for purchase and other regular expenses. A fundraising committee is being appointed to solicit donations separately. All parties believe that the society has made many contributions to advocating the Chinese cooperative movement over the years. The establishment of this library is not only something that should be done to commemorate the pioneers of cooperation, but also enough to emulate the Ireland Agricultural Organisation Society Cooperative Library, and will have a great relationship with the promotion of the Chinese cooperative movement in the future. It is heard that the fundraising for the library is progressing smoothly.</p>

<p>The national situation is also dangerous. Knowledgeable people all believe that the way to save the country lies first in revitalizing the national spirit. Therefore, the call for national revival has become very loud. However, a concrete and complete plan has not yet been asked for. Therefore, the society launched a solicitation of contributions, hoping to provide a reference for the Chinese people, and prepared a small reward to thank the hard work of the great articles.</p>

<h3 id="e226">The Large-Scale Aurora University Museum; The Animal Section Has Already Been Opened <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The Aurora University Museum in Lujiawan was completed in June of this year. It is large in scale and has a detailed collection, which is unique in Shanghai. The person in charge is Mr. Zheng Bier, a French national and director of entomology at the museum. It is divided into animal, plant, insect, antique, and library sections, as well as a medicine room and an office. The building is novel and the layout is well-organized. The animal section has already been opened in July, displaying various animals, such as tigers, bears, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses, whales, eels, and hundreds of specimens, skeletons, and models of exotic birds and animals. The collection is extremely rich. The plant and insect sections have complete specimens, with approximately a thousand boxes, which are only for scholars to study and are not open to the public. If people from all walks of life need to study them, they can also apply to enter and browse. The antique section is currently being actively arranged. There are many kinds of items, such as Zhou tripods and Han tiles, ancient clothing and hats, carvings, jade ware, etc., totaling approximately a thousand pieces, which are priceless and rare. According to the person in charge of the museum, all the specimens and skeletons of various animals, plants, and insects in the museum were collected by the late Mr. Han, a French priest. He traveled to various provinces in China, as well as Nanyang, India, and Africa. They were previously displayed in the Xujiahui Museum, but the scale was small and not enough, so they were all moved here. As for the antiques, most of them were collected by a certain Westerner in Tushanwan over the years. After his death, they were all donated. Once the arrangement is completed, it can be officially opened in one or two months.</p>

<p>The National Sports Conference passed the proposal of the Ministry of Education to establish a Sports Committee. After the Ministry of Education organized the Sports Committee, it requested the Ministry of Education to propose the establishment of a National Physical Education School, which was passed by the 75th Executive Meeting and handed over to Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministries of Education and Finance to jointly plan. Due to funding, location, and other reasons, it was not carried out. After the closing of the National Games, the Ministry of Education held the second Sports Committee meeting, and the old matter was brought up again, so it was decided to propose it to the Executive Yuan meeting again in order to realize this matter. Recently, the Ministry of Military Training intends to run a National Military Sports School, which has the same purpose as the National Physical Education School that the Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education intends to run. It is heard that the Sports Committee will send representatives to the Ministry of Military Training to discuss the principles of cooperation in the near future, according to the resolution. The so-called Military Sports School and the National Physical Education School may be merged into one in the future. As for what it will be named and the detailed methods, it will be necessary to wait until the Sports Committee and the Ministry of Military Training have made contact before they can gradually plan.</p>

<h3 id="e244">War <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>According to the predictions of the foreign Liu Bowen, the Second World War will break out in the Far East between 1935 and 1936, and China's coastal areas will be affected by the war. As a result, some neurotic people are restless and planning to go to the Pamir Plateau to take refuge. Whether this plan is what is called containing a hidden beast meaning, deliberately pretending to be such a panic, I am not very clear, but according to my experience in several civil wars and foreign wars, I feel that war is not so terrible.</p>
<p>In war, there is naturally the danger of being killed by bombs dropped from airplanes, being killed by stray bullets, being captured and killed by enemy troops as plainclothes teams, and being beaten to death by the people as traitors, but if you dig a cellar in advance, hide good food, and wait to see sandbags and barbed wire, you can drill into the cellar to hide, without fail. If you are blessed by the Tai Bai star and protected by the Zi Wei star, then you will not die, and it doesn't matter if you just hear about it outside. You see, in the European war, except for those who were destined to die, those who were not destined to die are still living well, eating bread and drinking wine.</p>
<p>Those who dig cellars are naturally people who value their lives as much as Mount Tai. Life is a hundred years, and one cannot escape death in the end, so those who think more openly simply sit down with four people and play the thirteenth chapter of Zuo Zhuan, because the sound of the tiles can cover up the sound of guns and cannons on the front line, eliminating the terror of war.</p>
<p>People with vision should hurry to open a hotel, or rent several pavilions and three-story railings, and they will surely make a fortune. On a smaller scale, go and contract a large number of extra editions, or print in advance some telegrams of the enemy's generals being killed on the same day, and when the firecrackers go off, you will surely make a big profit. Tuibeitu and Shaobing Ge can also be sold. To put it more unambitiously, becoming a petty traitor is not a bad business.</p>
<p>Those who are not destined to die don't need to rush, they won't be killed. Those who are destined to die don't need to rush either, eating some Tian Hua Fen can also choke you to death. War is not as terrible as we imagine, so there is no need to go to the Pamir Plateau to take refuge, let alone make a long journey.</p>
<h3 id="e245">King <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Jian</p>
<p>The word "King," whether heard or seen, will evoke twelve points of envy and admiration. Because the title of "King" must be unique in a line to be worthy of the name. In fact, the title of "King" is indeed very rare and uncommon in the world. Therefore, the two words "King" have become a supreme honorific.</p>
<p>"King" has a wide market abroad, so the title of "King" is also obtained very often. For example, in the automotive field, there is an Automobile "King." In the kerosene field, there is a Kerosene "King." In the steel industry, there is a Steel "King," and there are other such "Kings," popping up everywhere, making it too numerous to list.</p>
<p>However, "King" has a special market in China. Although there is no Automobile "King," no Kerosene "King," and no Steel "King"; peanuts have a Peanut "King," sunflower seeds have a Sunflower Seed "King," and beef has a Beef "King." "King" has been made so diverse that it is truly impossible to sort out.</p>
<p>You call yourself "King," and I call myself "King," to the point that the two words "King" themselves are at a loss and cannot agree. Therefore, "King" had to seriously consider, thinking left and right: foreign cars, kerosene, and steel want to add the title of "King" because they are Kings and are called "King." Adding "King" to them is a great honor. Not to mention that each owner calling themselves "King" will thank me, but I myself have supreme glory. Not to mention that each owner has face, even my two words "King" have face. At the same time, Chinese peanuts, sunflower seeds, and beef also want to add "King," which is truly absurd. The very essence of "King" cannot help but be filled with sorrow. Many thoughts welled up in the heart of the two words "King." It thought: the "King" of Chinese Peanut "King," Sunflower Seed "King," and Beef "King" will be confused with the "King" of Automobile "King," Kerosene "King," and Steel "King." Isn't this too insulting to "King"!</p>
<p>When "King" thought, it felt twelve points of indignation; but in fact, it could not forcibly argue, and could only let it pass roughly.</p>
<p>In the end, the very essence of the two words "King" revealed a burst of satirical sneer.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Talking About a Few Things About Women <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Gong</p>
<p>I remember when I was studying in Beiping a few years ago, there was a beautiful female classmate who often showed off many letters from men asking for her love in front of her friends, thinking it was the supreme glory, and at that time, none of her friends did not envy her. Also, once I went to a friend's house, and it happened that his wife was playing cards with three other ladies. At that time, another richly dressed lady walked in, and everyone stood up to greet her. One of the ladies, perhaps paying attention to the cards in front of her, had not yet risen to her feet, and this richly dressed lady immediately ran in front of her and asked her:</p>
<p>"Where does your old man work?"</p>
<p>"In XX Foreign Company."</p>
<p>The lady immediately turned her face and loudly rebuked her:</p>
<p>"Just because you're an employee of a foreign company, you're so impolite? Our old man is the manager of XX Bank!"</p>
<p>This is so glorious! Our old man is a bank manager, but thinking about it the other way around, this is a woman's greatest shame.</p>
<p>In fact, when this richly dressed lady said these words, she had not anticipated her own position. She thought that she was the absolute possession of her husband. "To beat a dog, one must look at the master's face," so she dared to boldly scold the impolite lady, that she should not be so impolite to her, because my husband… the master… is a bank manager.</p>
<p>From the above two small things, we can think of the psychology of ordinary women now, still not shaking off the bad habit of relying on men, even willingly admitting that they are not as good as men! This is truly a very shameful thing!</p>
<p>Here, I think of a story of Wu Zetian, the only female emperor in our country:</p>
<p>Emperor Taizong of Tang once obtained a strong, fat horse,</p>
<p>but no one could control it. Wu Zhao then went up and said to Emperor Taizong, "I can control this horse. But there are three things: an iron whip, an iron mace, and a dagger. If it does not submit to the whip, then mace it; if it does not submit to the mace, then cut its throat!"</p>
<p>What courage, what power! We need not elaborate on Wu Zhao's great contributions to women's liberation later. Just this one thing is enough to tell us that there was such a woman in ancient China. Her strong and resolute personality was no less than that of a man. But how today's women feel about Wu Zetian is unknown.</p>

<p>— Fu Yiye</p>
<p>If we recognize spring as the season of flowers, then autumn is the season of leaves. There is nothing in a year as magnificent as the flowers of spring, nor is there anything as rich and brilliant as the leaves of autumn. Autumn is the most beautiful season in nature, and it is also the most suitable time for color painting. Autumn, is it a painting autumn?</p>
<p>On the vast river, the sky is blue, and large patches of white clouds are flying. Withered grass and reed flowers are gathering a rustling autumn feeling in the west wind. In the distance, a few sails are returning with the afterglow of the setting sun, evoking the reverie of distant travelers. This is the autumn painting on the river.</p>
<p>On the undulating peaks and mountains, there are forests intertwined half sparsely and half densely. Here, there are towering strange rocks, ancient trees with the power of dragons, complex and mottled red leaves, colorful autumn mountains. In the winding paths and cliffs, two or three woodcutters are carrying firewood, faintly climbing the mountain, arousing feelings of pastoral interest. This is the autumn painting in the mountains. But, the scenery on the river is far less beautiful than the scenery in the mountains, that is because the colors in the mountains are actually richer than those on the river. These colors are dyed by countless leaves of varying depths and shades. A single leaf is like a rainbow in the sky, a beautiful feather on a phoenix, a fine powder on a butterfly's wing. It is nature that weaves a huge and beautiful autumn painting.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Silently Passing Tea with Sorrow to Comfort Her Husband, Hastily Leaving the Border with a Forced Smile to Say Goodbye to Her Family</p>
<p>Jiang nodded silently, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, and let them go. She was thinking to herself, once a girl has a husband's family, her heart will naturally follow her husband. Look at her, even though she is extremely sad, she still wants to put on a pretty face in front of her husband, patting on powder several times, before leaving. This shows that a woman always seeks her husband's happiness. Without a husband, everything is gone. She stayed alone in the house, thinking dully. She didn't know how much time had passed, only to see the sunlight on the wall in the courtyard had slanted to the eaves, and was tinged with a golden yellow. This undoubtedly meant that it was almost evening. Only then did she wake up. This couple used to not care about going out, how is it that now that they have gone out, they don't know when to come back. She couldn't stand being alone, so she ran to the back courtyard to talk to Zhao Weng for a while. Zhao Weng also felt the same as his son, only feeling sorry for the other person, and tried his best to comfort her with words. After a while, she heard the sound of leather shoes in the front courtyard. Jiang knew that Ziqiang and Guizhi had returned, so she immediately ran to the outer courtyard. Zhao Ziqiang walked quickly and had already reached the door of the back courtyard. Guizhi, however, stood in the outer courtyard with her head half-lowered. When she left, her face was snow-white, but now, on her yellowish face, hung streaks of dry tear marks. Her eyes were red and unusually swollen. Just looking at her lowered eyelashes, in that silent moment, she must have gone through an extremely sad event. But the bitter water in her daughter's heart, she knew herself, and if she tried to gloss over it, she might be trying to hide it from her mother. If she asked her, it would only provoke her complaints. Therefore, Jiang did not stare at her face, and went into the house by herself. (234)</p>

<p>— Huang Shiying</p>
<p>Comics, it can be said, are very popular lately. They have been published sporadically in magazines and newspapers, especially as embellishments in daily newspaper supplements. Special issues and special editions seem to be a very fashionable attire, and everyone is vying to imitate them. On the surface, it seems that comics have reached a prosperous period, but is it really prosperous? We might as well discuss it from the origin of comics and the recent quality of content.</p>
<p>I. A Retrospective of Comics in China</p>
<p>In this Eastern country, which absorbs Western civilization as much as possible, following Western civilization is considered an honor everywhere. Comics are also a kind of Eastern expansion of European style. Five years ago, cartoonists in Shanghai jointly published "Shanghai Comics," establishing a foundation for comics in the dull Chinese society. It was also a preliminary understanding of comics for people in society. Unfortunately, this pictorial died young! It could not form a lasting gathering with its newly acquainted friends, but its seeds had already been sown. The impression it gave to readers surpassed a sweet and delicious fresh fruit, thus arousing the interest of comrades and engaging in practice. This is the first stage of comics in China. Since then, these comrades who have become interested in comics have continued to publish "China Comics," "Weekly Comics," "Linglong Comics," and other publications, although they also ceased publication soon. However, they have aroused the attention of the press. Thus, from independent publications to newspaper comic supplements, it can be said that comics have entered the second stage. Comics have become widespread through newspapers, thus gaining the interest of a wide range of readers. The future of comics in China has unfolded a bright path!</p>
<p>II. The Distorted State of Today</p>
<p>Comics are an art, using the power of this art to negatively criticize life and positively create life. Therefore, cartoonists should have a calm mind to observe all the secrets of society, and in light and flexible painting techniques, make people see their ridiculous and pitiful true faces. Therefore, they must grasp the spirit of the times to promote the strength of the nation! They occupy the same important position as writers and sculptors, and can achieve greater results. But can our so-called comics now fulfill this mission?</p>
<p>In China, where everything is backward, comics cannot escape their backward fate! Perhaps it is excusable, but we are always discovering this kind of superficial and simply ridiculous things in the newspapers, which is a bit disappointing! I think, more practice and more promotion are indeed good, but why publish so much? To know that just drawing a picture randomly and calling it promoting comics will only make things worse. Not only will it not contribute to comics, but it will also lose the true meaning of comics. What a painful thing this is!</p>
<p>Newspaper editors, of course, are enthusiastic about promoting comics, so they indiscriminately gather these people and place this responsibility on them. They have such opportunities, but they do not work hard. If their own strength is insufficient, they copy and steal. As a result, copied works that are half as good as the original fill the publications. This is a tragic phenomenon in the distorted development of comics in our country recently!</p>
<p>III. Hopes for the Future</p>
<p>Now comics are indeed very popular. If we can put in a lot of effort in terms of thought and skill, then the hope for the future is really great. If we are always childish in our thinking and have not been trained in skills at all, and publish randomly in newspapers, this will cause readers to have a bad impression of comics, and even dislike them! Therefore, we must carefully cultivate this newly growing seedling, and we should rectify the pace of comics, from superficial to profound, from simple to complex, from animal desires to truth, from individual to society. We must earnestly polish and cultivate our thoughts and techniques, correct this distorted art, and achieve good results, so as not to waste the efforts of all comrades.</p>

<h3 id="e250">On Using Vernacular Chinese in Official Documents <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Recently, I have been hearing many contradictory news at the same time. One just said that those in charge of education are encouraging the reading of scriptures again, so "Huang Qing Jing Jie" and "Thirteen Classics with Annotations and Commentaries" have become popular again recently; another said that official documents should also use vernacular Chinese, or at least use some new-style punctuation and symbols. A few days ago, a friend who works in an office came to me to discuss the writing of vernacular Chinese and the use of punctuation marks. I asked him how classical Chinese was done. He said: "The method of classical Chinese is very easy. For example, for official documents, just teach a few '...'etc., and then copy the text. No matter how complicated the case file is, it will be clear at a glance." His words seemed to regret the beautiful official document format that was about to be abolished. I told him that there was no need to be pessimistic, this official document format could not be abolished no matter what. Because China has always been a country that reveres the past, even in the Qin Dynasty, Confucian scholars were required to take officials as teachers?</p>
<p>"But now the situation is different!" he said worriedly.</p>
<p>Because I had no way to dispel his worries, I had no choice but to think of Stendhal and say: "Please rest assured, this great French writer was still imitating Napoleon's legal terms and sentence structures when he wrote articles!"</p>
<p>The advocacy of vernacular Chinese has had more than ten years of history so far, and as a result, it has only occupied a few punctuation marks and symbols in six-character notices and official documents such as "...etc.", which has caused a large group of people to be furious and indignant. I really don't know in which year the entire feudal system will be swept away?</p>
<h3 id="e251">On the "Opium War" <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Bo</p>
<p>After reading "Tokyo View of the Roar" published in "Free Talk" on October 17, Mr. Jusheng pointed out "A Mistake by Mr. Gaoming" in "Free Talk" on October 27, meaning: "The Opium War" was written by Tomoyoshi Murayama, while Mr. Gaoming mistakenly thought it was written by Kan Eguchi. But in "Free Talk" on November 1, Mr. Gaoming again "protested," saying that "as far as I know, the Opium War was indeed originally written by Mr. Kan Eguchi." This has made us "uninformed" readers a bit "mystified." 丨丨 Who exactly is "The Opium War" the work of? Murayama? Or Eguchi?</p>
<p>"As far as I know," in Japan, there are two dramas with the Opium War as the theme: one is "The Opium War" by Osamu Ema, and the other is "The First European Flag" by Tomoyoshi Murayama. And Murayama's work is actually very related to Ema's work. According to Murayama's preface to the drama collection "The First European Flag," at first, because he was not satisfied with Ema's work, when the play was staged at the Tsukiji Theater (August 1929, directed and designed by Murayama), he obtained the author's consent and made major revisions, resulting in a collaboration between the two people; but, since that performance, he was even more dissatisfied with that kind of confusion, so he simply rewrote it completely. As a result, "The First European Flag" is actually completely different from "The Opium War."</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, we can easily understand:</p>
<p>First, the original author of "The Opium War" should be Osamu Ema, not Kan Eguchi ("As far as I know": Mr. Eguchi's works are mostly novels and fairy tales, with very few dramas). Mr. Gaoming obviously mistook Osamu Ema for Kan Eguchi. Second, Mr. Jusheng pointed out that "The Opium War" was written by Mr. Murayama, which is naturally not wrong, because "The First European Flag" is also known as "The Opium War." However, I feel that in this kind of place, after pointing this out, it should also be explained that Mr. Osamu Ema also wrote the play "The Opium War." Because judging from the time (four or five years ago), location (Hongō Theater), and performing troupe (Tsukiji Troupe) of Mr. Gaoming's play, the "Opium War" he saw was obviously a script co-authored by Osamu Ema and Tomoyoshi Murayama: and in fact, Murayama at that time was only a reviser, and perhaps the script still used the name of the original author Osamu Ema (a name with one character the same as the name of Kan Eguchi) during that performance.</p>
<p>The above is the fact "as far as I know." I dare not flaunt "high intelligence," but just record what I know.</p>

<p>— After Turning Peng</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder, and the great frost of November is brewing, and soon it will begin to fall·······</p>
<p>On a gloomy day, a strong wind rolled up the yellow plane tree leaves on the street. At the corner of a road, the wind swirled, and the fallen leaves swirled. On the side street of Cement, a dirty beggar woman was sitting with her knees bent against the wall. Her feet were wrapped very small. She was wearing a man's tattered jacket, and her breasts were like deflated rubber bags, hanging empty······ A baby less than one year old sucked on the nipple, and his small hands tightly held the mother's breast, as if to squeeze out as much milk as possible. Another child of seven or eight years old, naked in the upper body, lay on his mother's knee, silent, like a wounded, dying little animal. A gust of cold wind blew, and he shrank his body and convulsed······</p>
<p>"Have mercy, madam, grandma······ the child is freezing to death······ starving to death······"</p>
<p>The mother begged the passers-by with a crying voice, putting her hands together and touching her head on the ground.</p>
<p>The beggar woman relied on this half-naked child to beg, letting the child freeze in this cold, windy weather, to gain some sympathy and alms in front of people.</p>
<p>Groups of people walked past, not even glancing at her······ "Have mercy······"</p>
<p>The mother's throat was dry and hoarse. Her throat was on fire, and her stomach was on fire.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and the street lights lit up, like laughing, satirical eyes, the city became more beautiful.</p>
<p>The child raised his drooping, heavy head and stared at his mother, looking at her face.</p>
<p>"Mom, how many copper coins do you have?"</p>
<p>The mother fumbled in her pocket; "One, two, three·······"</p>
<p>"Not enough to drink two bowls of porridge······ only to drink water, only······"</p>
<p>The child lowered his head again, his skin frozen and swollen purple.</p>
<p>"Let's go back丨"</p>
<p>The mother said; holding one child in one hand and leading one child in the other.</p>
<p>At night, the weather was even colder. The great frost of November was brewing, perhaps it would begin to fall tonight·······</p>

<p>— Xiaoxue</p>
<p>A few months ago, in the magazine "Unnamed Literary Monthly," I read "Harvest" by Ye Zijun. At that time, I wanted to write a few words, but because the magazine was borrowed by someone soon after, it was put on hold. Yesterday, I bought a newly published "Literature," and in it, I saw the sequel to "Harvest" by Ye Zijun, "Fire." Eager to know the new developments of this writer in a few months, I read it first. Now, according to the annotations at the end of the article, let's connect the two articles together and express some opinions.</p>
<p>Regarding "Harvest," because the magazine is still with a friend, I can only speak based on the outline I wrote down at the time. This novel, at that time, could be said to be until now, deeply aroused my attention, which can be said to be the rich rural life experience. Among the several novels depicting the disaster of a good harvest produced in 1933, this article is probably the most substantial in content. The author is really familiar with rural life. Although the technique is not very pure, under the author's pen, there is endless truth of life crowded there, which everyone will feel. To describe farmers, the author must truly understand rural life in order to have good success; only in this way can we overcome the tendency of good content being empty, specializing in using skills to make up the number of words, and showing off. Because of this, I think the future of this writer is very broad. Secondly, what makes me satisfied with this novel is the description of the joyful atmosphere about the harvest before the harvest. Mr. Ye Shengtao's "More Harvested Three to Five Dou" is the same. The farmers did not know the price of grain, and they were full of joy. However, Ye Zijun wrote more and closer to rural life, so the reflection of the rural situation after the disaster is even more tragic. Like this kind of technique, from what he describes, there is no place that is not based on real rural life, which I think is very moving and successful.</p>
<p>With these advantages, there are also many shortcomings. First, what I want to say is the problem of this writer's understanding. That is, in "Harvest Disaster," the author cannot have an in-depth and multi-faceted understanding of the structure of rural society, and writes all the problems as if they exist in a simple and independent way. Second, regarding the younger generation, it is of course possible to write obscurely, but when the obscurity is so great that the tracer cannot grasp a clear outline, the impression that this younger generation gives to readers will be very faint; only with such a faint situation as written last year, in the process of working for the next generation, there is no reasonable, step-by-step development to narrate. Third, in the selection of materials, it is not very appropriate. "Harvest" is a 20,000-word novel, and judging from the materials it collects, it should become a 40,000- to 50,000-word novella, and of course it can be developed into a novel. Putting so much material all into a short story will inevitably fail to have sufficient descriptions in all aspects, making readers feel the crowding and accumulation of materials. However, although the author has these shortcomings, it does not prevent the existence of this novel and its advantages. I express my respect to Ye Zijun.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because my hope for Ye Zijun is too enthusiastic. After I finished reading "Fire," I felt that Ye Zijun did not achieve the same success as "Harvest" in this novel. This is the sequel to "Harvest," which describes the obscure aspects of the previous article and the subsequent developments. In some places, the impression I get is exactly the opposite of "Harvest." The theme that the author wants to write has not been fully developed, not only losing its organization everywhere, but also failing to grasp the center of gravity in many places. This can be seen from the description of the mass action and the lack of explanation for the arrested people. In terms of materials, if we say that "Harvest" is crowded and accumulated, then "Fire" is the opposite. The content of many paragraphs is monotonous, empty, and lacks truth. "Harvest Disaster" depicts the truth of rural areas, and the author's attitude is also serious and enthusiastic; while "Fire" inevitably shows a non-serious tendency in some places, and the emotions are not as sincere. Here, I feel that Ye Zijun needs to quickly delve into life. I hope Ye Zijun will have better works in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Two Brothers (22) <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>So, as he walked through the streets and alleys, looking around, he thought about how trivial the reasons that determine our behavior are. For three weeks, he could have, and should have, made such a decision long ago, but it undoubtedly suddenly germinated in his heart because his brother had received an inheritance.</p>
<p>He stopped at the entrances of those houses with beautiful houses or magnificent houses for rent, and he did not bother to look at the notices that did not have adjectives such as beautiful or magnificent. He walked in with great vigor, estimating the height of the ceilings, drawing pictures of the houses in his notebook, and recording how the rooms were connected and the exits of the houses. He told others that he was a doctor and that many people came to see him. The stairs had to be large and clean; and his house could not be located above the third floor.</p>
<p>He recorded seven or eight addresses, and after writing down about two hundred words of explanation in a scrawled manner, he ran home for lunch, already a quarter of an hour late.</p>
<p>As he walked in, he heard the sound of dishes. People had started eating without waiting for him. What was the reason for this? Their family's meal time had never been so accurate. He felt a little embarrassed and dissatisfied, because he was originally very sensitive. As soon as he entered, Old Man Roche said to him:</p>
<p>"Hey, Pierre, hurry up! You know we have to go to the notary at two o'clock. Today is not a day for strolling."</p>
<p>The doctor didn't answer anything. After hugging and kissing his mother, and shaking hands with his father and brother, he sat down; he took the pork chop that had been left for him from the empty vegetable bowl in the middle of the table. The pork chop was already cold and had no juice at all. This must be the worst piece. He thought that people could have left the pork chop in the stove to wait for him to come back and take it out, instead of being so busy looking after the second son that they forgot about the other son丨丨the eldest son丨丨. The family's conversation, which he had interrupted when he came in, continued from where it had left off.</p>
<p>"If it were me," Madame Roland said to Zhe'an, "I would do this immediately: I would live very luxuriously, so as to attract people's attention. I would associate with high society, I would ride horses, I would choose one or two interesting lawsuits to defend, and establish a reputation in court. I would become a rare, non-professional lawyer. Thank goodness, you don't need to make a living yourself now, but you still need to have a profession, just so that you don't waste the results of your research. And a person shouldn't do nothing at all."</p>
<p>Old Man Roland, who was peeling a pear, said:</p>
<p>"Ah! If I were in your position, I would buy a beautiful boat, a pilot's small boat. I could sit in this boat all the way to Senegal."</p>
<p>Now it was Pierre's turn to express his opinion. In his opinion, in short, property cannot increase a man's ethical or intellectual value. Ordinary people will only degenerate with money, while brave people can get powerful help with money. But brave people are rare. If Zhe'an is really a superior man, now that he doesn't need to make a living, he can just express his superiority. But he has to put in a hundred times the effort that he would never have in any other situation. It is not to defend or attack widows and orphans in court, or to earn a lot of money in all lawsuits, regardless of winning or losing, but to become an outstanding jurist, the light of the legal world.</p>
<p>He added two sentences as a conclusion:</p>
<p>"If I had money, I would dissect some corpses!"</p>

<h3 id="e255">Finance: U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate Soars, Gold Price Drops Again by 6.8 Yuan, Initially Breaking the 740 Yuan Mark Outside the Market, Electric Transmission U.S. Market Closed, Causing Short Covering and Recovery <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>The gold market continued to decline yesterday, with gross prices once breaking 740 yuan, at 378 yuan, with new lows emerging one after another. However, with the U.S. closed today, and no reports from U.S. dollar exchange rates and various markets, the general psychology believed it was beneficial to the bullish side, resulting in a quite firm mid-way situation. In fact, HSBC's licensed English and American rates had not changed. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw declines in England and rises in the U.S. The forward silver price on the Gold Exchange rose by 0.95 to 1.05 cents. Exchange rates rose uniformly. London spot gold fell by 6.5 pence. The U.S. official purchase price for newly mined gold was 32.84 yuan, up 0.17 yuan from the previous day. Stocks fell by 0.59 yuan. U.S. cotton fell by 0.21 pounds. U.S. wheat fell by 1.75 cents. The off-market opened from outside 40 yuan, retreating to 378 yuan. Short covering surged, and the trend recovered. After opening, due to tight domestic demand, people's minds turned for the better. HSBC's listed price did not move, and news of the U.S. market closing quickly rose, approaching the 50 yuan mark. Later, due to banks selling expensively, and silver companies and the Central Exchange Bureau resuming supply, the exchange rate eased, and the gold price gradually moved downstream. It was found that most of the market conditions in the morning were for short covering. Although Reuters had a report from Jones, director of the U.S. Financial Relief Society, the quantity of gold purchased and the U.S. purchase price of gold exceeded London's triangular exchange rate by 492.5 points, and news of farmers' strikes lacked influence. The scorched price was 1,115 yuan. The market conditions in the morning will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 742.3 yuan, down 10.05 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 1.5 yuan. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of English exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 6875, and U.S. exchange at 32.0622 yuan. Hengxing came on the market to sell strips, retreating to 1 yuan. Zhengjin bought February U.S. dollars at 75 to 6875. Hengyu, Yuchang, Zhengchang, Zhifeng, Yongyuanxing, Yonggan, Changxiang, Chunyuan, Yongyuansheng, Yongtian, Fengyong, and other companies jointly bought heavily. Although Reuters had a report from Jones, director of the U.S. Financial Relief Society, reporting that the purchase of cash had reached 2,800,000 ounces, etc., people's minds turned for the better. It was known in advance that HSBC's listed price would not move. Citibank bought February U.S. dollars at 5625, rising to 8 yuan. Bingxing sold out. Pangen sold December U.S. dollars at 0625, retreating to 6.3 yuan. Subsequently, this price was difficult to settle, and Hongxing and others bought heavily, rising to 9.3 yuan. Hengyu, Changsheng, Yongyuan, Fengyong, Qangan, Changxiang, Fushun, Yifeng, Yongzhaofeng, Chang and other companies jointly sold off, gradually falling. HSBC sold December U.S. dollars at 0625, and Huabi sold the same month at 125, falling to within 5 yuan. HSBC bought March U.S. dollars at 8125. At this time, it hovered around 5 yuan. After entering the market, silver companies and the Central Exchange Bureau dumped, and March U.S. dollars at 875 were difficult to buy. Under the supply of Yuanmao, Yong and others, it once fell to 21.5 yuan. Banks did forward trading of January U.S. dollars at 4375. Zhengchang, Fuchang, Yida, and Yongjin reached 6 yuan. Macallie sold December U.S. dollars at 1875, which was still difficult to stabilize. After struggling, the noon close was 746 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 5.5 yuan, and finally around 6 yuan, which was Yuanmao and Yongyuanfeng slightly accepted. The highest price for half a yuan was 749.3 yuan, and the lowest was 741 yuan, with a difference of 8.3 yuan. As a result, it fell back by 6.8 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price, because HSBC's U.S. dollar listing price did not move, was still 31.5 yuan, and the combined gold price was weakly at 762 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 16 yuan less, which was about 7 yuan more than the previous close. The booked price for this month was 754 yuan, and for December it was 746 yuan. The supplementary water in the morning was 754 yuan. The scorched price was 1,115 yuan. Trading in the market was slightly quiet. Taikangrun bought 200 taels of Tianjin goods with the Zhengyang brand, for 1,122 yuan. Tongfeng, Hengying, Fenghheng, and Fengjin Tianjin goods were for 1,118 yuan to 20 yuan. A total of more than 500 taels were transacted. For this month's strips, there were still 1,253 strips left.</p>
<p>Trading in the market continued to make efforts to cover shorts. In summary, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Zhifeng, Yonghongxing, Fuyu, Yongfeng, Yida, Yonghengyu, Zhengchang, Yuanxing, Tianfeng, Yongchunyuan, Yongyifeng, Yonghengchang, Yongdingchang, Runchang, Yuyuan, Kangxiang, Ruixing, and others were on the buying side. Hengxing, Bingxing, Changsheng, Yongdafa, Yongdakang, Dadecheng, Richang, Yuanfeng, Yongdachang, Xiangfu, Taiheng, Xianghe, Yuanchun, and others were on the selling side. Dalian gang Wanxing made a total of more than 3,000, and squeezed in more than 600 strips. Shunli made a total of more than 2,000, and squeezed in more than 200 strips. Guang gang Hengxing sold about 300 strips. There were a total of 29,764 chips for December.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was once again sluggish. Both the bulls and bears appeared extremely calm on the surface, as if they both held the principle of not settling without profit. Coupled with the racing season in recent days, the environment was also unchanged. The number of people gathering in the market was sparse, the market atmosphere was bleak, and the market price was sluggish. However, such repeated upholding made the future feel increasingly dangerous. Both the bulls and bears should be cautious in their actions. Yesterday's morning opening saw some weakness in retrenchment and troop reduction. After entering, the No. 4 buying was still energetic, and the market price was slightly higher, but after the salt tax, it still felt tired and unable to rise. The market price in the same session was inconsistent, and the anxiety of the people was evident. The secondary market was particularly quiet, and most bonds were unattended to. The number of listed market prices was very few, which was a sluggish phenomenon unseen in months. Naturally, there was no rise or fall in the market price to speak of. The afternoon opening, except for No. 4 which still had some demand, the transactions of the other gangs were still sparse. The market price also saw mutual ups and downs, only hovering around one jiao. The closing transaction was still lackluster, and the entry and exit of each gang were still extremely sluggish. The market price was still uneven. The overall trend throughout the day did not deviate from the path of sluggish hovering. As a result, the market price was still up by one or two jiao, with the most being the 19th customs duty forward contract rising by five jiao. However, the 20th customs duty forward contract and gold short still fell by about one jiao. The total transaction volume was 4.2 million yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot goods, 1.95 million yuan in futures unified salt tax, 670,000 yuan occupied by retrenchment and troop reduction, only 400,000 yuan in the 19th customs duty charitable deeds, 715,000 yuan in the 20th volume 20th customs duty, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to over ten thousand.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 6th that the New York stock market was even more depressed. Except for gold and silver mines, each stock slightly rose by a small number of jiao. The silver price reached 4.5 jiao, creating a new high for the year. Rumors that the government was about to raise the ratio of silver to gold were still rampant. Wall Street was discussing the possibility of silver prices rising to 5 jiao. Gold mining stocks were in an unstable state due to rumors of a gold production tax. The total daily transaction volume was only 690,000 shares. Mobil Oil Company decided to convene a special shareholders meeting on December 14 to pass the merger of the company's operations in the Far East with the production department of the New Jersey Oil Company to form a new company. The new company's capital was set at 150 million to 200 million US dollars, which would be shared equally by the two companies. It is predicted that the operations of both companies will benefit from it. "Wheat" buyers were quite cautious because bulls settled down a small portion. The remaining harvest conditions were favorable to the bulls. "Cotton" fell due to the settlement of December bulls at one jiao per pound. Credit was gradually being used by the people, and the foundation was still firm. However, the current situation was uncertain. The Financial Rehabilitation Corporation announced the price of gold per tael as 32.84 yuan, up 1.7 jiao.</p>

<p>In the flour market, customer demand continued to be active, and factory dumping stopped. Customers were constantly inquiring about Northeast sales and Beiyang help. Everyone was optimistic about the upward trend. Each factory stopped selling to await market price increases due to active cash flow.

Although the report on foreign wheat Luo was still small, the orders were quiet, and the factory sales of cash wheat were also active. Foreign wheat had not yet arrived at the port. Brokers all mainly sold off cash and no longer dumped it. The bulls' aspirations were stable, and the shorts covered their positions, so the prices gradually increased after the opening each month.

For this reason, the market prices of Changbang Su Tong Jing and Nangang and other patterns of thick rice fell by 0.1-0.2 jiao. The Du Yang Jian also softened near the ruler. As for Qing Jiao Si Feng and other market late rice, fortunately, Baowei Jinbang continued to handle over 200 bags, and Qingdao, Yantai, and other market handled 1,500-1,600 bags, so the price fell slightly by a few fen to about a jiao. Various broken jing were the same as before. The Yin Yuan market price declined by an amount of jiao because the liquor customers' stomach intake became stagnant.</p>

However, the sales to Guangzhou were not large, and they only sold a few hundred bags of Jing Xian and Yang Jian. There was still no information about Xiang rice because Xiang rice was already being directly transported to Guangdong, and there was no intention to handle it in Shanghai again. It must be that the Shanghai price was suitable for the place of production before it could be sold. The local street and the interior were inquiring about low-priced old goods. Although the transaction volume for the day was not very prosperous, the market had been activated. The whole city Guang Gang handled 600 bags of Nanjing Ji Xian at a price of 6.4-6.05 yuan, 240 bags of Wuxi Yang Jian at a price of 7.65 yuan, 300 bags of Hunan Chen Pi Jing at a price of 5.96 yuan, and 70 bags of Jiangxi Chen Ji Wan at a price of 6.8 yuan.</p>

<p>The shipment of Chinese silk to the United States in July decreased. The United States is the largest consumer of raw silk in the world. Chinese silk shipments to the United States account for 50-60% of the total, with 3,000-4,000 bales per month. Recently, due to the silk factory strike, the consumption of raw silk has greatly decreased. The shipment of Chinese silk to the United States has declined. Last month (October), a total of only 2,214 bales of Chinese silk were shipped from Shanghai to New York, a decrease of more than 500 bales compared with the previous month (September).</p>
<p>The shipment of Sichuan Jingzi silk to Shanghai was sparse. European sales of Sichuan Jingzi silk have not turned around for a long time, and the source is sparse. In the past ten days, a total of only 164 dan were shipped.</p>

<p>Chinese and foreign silk markets both held pessimistic views. The European and American raw silk markets currently have ample inventories. There is no hope of resolving the labor strikes at silk weaving factories. There is no need for it, and no one is inquiring about spot and futures silk. Overseas silk telegrams are not forwarded. In addition, yesterday was the second day of the autumn racing season, and the market was only open for half a day in the morning. There was no negotiation for silk transactions. In China.</p>

<p>Peanuts are one of the leguminous plants and contain extremely rich nutrients. Some say that their nourishing effect on the human body is not inferior to meat food; others say that they nourish the lungs and lubricate the intestines, and long-term consumption can prolong life. Therefore, they are valued by health experts. However, excessive consumption produces phlegm, which is a drawback. Peanuts are the abbreviation of fallen peanuts, because their flowers fall in the underground sand before they bear fruit. Also, because their kernels resemble rice grains in shape and also resemble beans, and the shell resembles a bean pod. Therefore, it is called peanut rice or peanut beans. Or because it has the effect of nourishing the human body, it is called the longevity fruit. Those with shells are called peanuts, and those without shells are called peanut kernels.</p>
<p>There are also many types of peanuts. The ones we often see are only differentiated into large and small. Small ones are further divided into those with and without selected pods. Their production areas are in various provinces in the north and south. However, there is very little production in the south because the climate is humid and the soil is mostly sticky, which is not suitable for peanut growth. If the soil in the north is loose and dry, it is suitable for planting, so it is easy to grow. The most famous production areas are Shandong and Henan provinces. Shandong has a large and good output, while Henan is slightly inferior. There are relatively more in coastal counties in Shandong, such as Boer, Weihaiwei, Qingdao, and Yantai, which are even more famous.</p>
<p>The sales channels of peanuts and raw kernels are extremely wide because they can be used as side dishes, made into candies and tea snacks, and are also a good leisure product and children's favorite. The larger channel is for oil factories to make oil, which is peanut oil. Abbreviated as raw oil, its effect is the same as virgin oil and rapeseed oil. What still has a huge channel in the inquiry industry is the export transaction of foreign banks. Try to check the export figures in the Customs Register over the years. It can be proved that it occupies an important position in my country's agricultural products. Foreign banks export selected high-quality products. The bamboo push product area of Shandong Boer has always had a standard: a large grain with 28 grains per tael is considered high-quality, 32 grains are considered mid-level, and 34 grains are another level lower. Er products are mostly high-quality, Weihaiwei and other places have already dropped a level, and the lower grades are , so the price of peanut kernels and raw oil in Boer is more expensive than in other ports.

<p>— Ya Zhu</p>
<p>It is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. Therefore, it can be assumed that the wish of life is just one word: "new."</p>
<p>Ordinary people are confined to all things in the ancient and modern world, using themselves as the standard. They consider obtaining what they lack, increasing what they have little of, and experiencing what they haven't experienced as "new." Children getting a piece of candy, women getting a piece of clothing, and people generally seeing the full moon and blooming flowers after the waning moon and withered flowers, feeling the warmth of spring and summer and then the solemn and desolate autumn and winter, all feel the "new" scenery. And thus evoke emotions of joy or sorrow.</p>
<p>However, there is another kind of person who, even if they haven't obtained things they can see and hear and know, won't feel particularly novel. Existing things and existing principles cannot arouse their interest or passion for pursuit. It's not that they are misanthropic, but they simply feel the superficiality of the present world. They are enlightened by history, and they always feel that beautiful things can be added to the world at any time, and the meaning of life can be deepened at any time. That is to say, each era can add some new things, so that the continuity of life will not become dull and uninteresting, and they believe that this responsibility cannot be borne by others. Only those who feel the superficiality of the present world and want to add new things to the existing world can handle it. Those who enjoy the new cannot escape this responsibility either. Therefore, others are satisfied with the existing world and do not create, so new things can only be created by those who can hope.</p>
<p>A person with new aspirations, new creations, and even new acquisitions finds life interesting. Living in the same old rut is practically the same as sleeping in a tomb. Regardless of whether something is considered good or bad, one must add some doubt because bad things should naturally be changed, and even good things have no absolute limit and there is always room for renewal. Therefore, only by loving the "new" and creating a "new" life can it be meaningful. Young people especially love new things, so their lives are the most active and full of vitality.</p>
<p>The reason why mankind loves life and does not abandon it is that the wise freely change the environment, such as scientists, philosophers, and revolutionaries. Ordinary people are bewildered by the changes in the environment and are repulsed by the novelty of their own lives, thus generating a feeling of attachment. Such as the difference in climate and scenery in the four seasons, the changes in oneself, in youth, strength, and old age. The natural changes in the universe will not bewilder the wise, and will not give new stimuli to those who live a rigid life, preventing them from becoming bored and ensuring their lives. The wise can also find some new comfort here before they have new creations.</p>
<p>Life is drawn by the rope of "new aspirations." When poor people learn that they cannot have new things or the hope of a new life, they feel pain and want to commit suicide. Therefore, poor people often like to spend two dimes to buy a lottery ticket (Guangdong lottery is very prosperous). From the lottery, they generate many new aspirations and thus patiently keep their lives. The "new" of the new home can be said to be the path of human evolution.</p>

<p>"You can't control me; I have my freedom!" Xiaojuan has been arguing with her parents about freedom countless times; as a result, the relationship between father and daughter has broken down, and her mother has secretly given her money while crying, telling her to leave the family, and that has also happened. However, after only a week, she automatically returned home.</p>
<p>"......Please be completely assured! I will leave this hellish family. If they want to send me to a certain man as a sex toy!" Ling has written these words countless times in her letters to her good lover; she also often writes: "I must fight for complete freedom in my entire life!"</p>
<p>She does this to strengthen the heart of the lover who is not from the same social class as her, in order to win his even more infatuated and passionate love.</p>
<p>It's not that Ling doesn't have this courage. This time, on the eve of her engagement, she secretly went to see the poor young man who made a living by selling articles, without her parents knowing. Originally, she stole three hundred yuan from her mother, planning to give it to him as travel expenses, to send him away from Shanghai, so that he wouldn't have to see her engaged to another man, but "Why did you have to lie to me until today?" After he said with a bitter smile, her thoughts immediately changed: "There's nothing I can do! I still love you, but you don't have money for us to get married. My mother said that I always have to marry someone, so why should I remain an old maid? I've thought it through, and I've resigned myself to letting them send me to someone else! We have no hope of living together!" The lover cried when he heard this, and a few teardrops as big as pearls stirred up her courage to leave her family. That night, without going home, they lived together without anyone else knowing.</p>
<p>Three hundred yuan can be spent faster in this feverish period than thirty yuan: she also made him a new suit from head to toe, as well as the clothes on her body, to mark the beginning of their new life; then, they went to the movie theater at eight o'clock in the evening, and at eleven thirty they were intoxicated by the jazz music in the dance hall; then, they ate and drank as they pleased; then...... The money... The two's feverish love life was not yet satisfied, the man's love became agitated, and she also felt mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>"From now on, we have to live according to the rules: the daily living expenses for the two of us, everything included, will be one yuan......"</p>
<p>"No, no!" she thought, "I'm used to spending one yuan a day on chocolate biscuits," but she didn't say it out loud.</p>
<p>Because she didn't say it, she felt even more that the life ahead would be difficult and miserable, and the man was still helplessly complaining, "This is already the best I can do in my life! You know that it's not easy for me to earn one yuan, right?"</p>
<p>Thinking about it: the mental effort she would have to expend to earn one yuan would be several times more than the water he drank in a day, and she couldn't help but feel her heart racing.</p>
<p>In reality, who can make a cat that has just eaten fish fillet rice willing to eat cold leftovers? The magic of love is great, but the life one is accustomed to is extraordinary; she endured a week of hard life with him for love, but could no longer bear it, and the great love did not bind her feet and lock her in his heart, so she finally slipped back home. After leaving her wealthy home for a few days, she felt extremely comfortable returning to her wealthy home; just like a little bird that is used to being raised in a golden cage, after flying out of the cage and enduring a few days of cold and hunger, it returns to the cage and feels even more satisfied with life in the golden cage. For a few days, she almost completely forgot about him and enjoyed her wealthy life.</p>
<p>But, one day, two days, more than ten days passed. She had to prepare to argue with her parents for freedom again, and her wealthy material life caused her extraordinary mental pain! This was detected by her mother, who said with a smile, "Good girl, Dad still protects you fully, aren't you grateful to him? You want freedom, you want freedom, why did you come back?"</p>
<p>She could only endure it and go to sleep for a while. "A bird in a cage cannot live in the wild, and besides, you are a bird that cannot fly out of a golden cage!" She read the letter he sent, and could no longer hold back her tears.</p>

<h3 id="e280">A Novel and Original Swindle <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Tu Ben</p>
<p>Recently, a small swindle occurred in our town. Although the value of the loss was only a hundred yuan or so, the swindler's thinking was novel and the swindling technique was unique, setting a new record in the history of swindling, worth a decade. The fact is this: He XX is a wealthy man in the town, with a good reputation. Next to his house, there was an empty house with a "For Rent" sign. One day, a middle-aged man with a Shanghai accent came and said that he worked for the XX Soap Company in Shanghai and planned to rent a room in the countryside to promote soap. After the house was rented, he said that he had come to the countryside alone and had not yet brought his luggage. He used ten yuan as a deposit and temporarily borrowed a set of bedclothes from He. He XX saw that he was honest in his work, so he agreed to do so. After living like this for a few days, the man never took a step outside. All his food was also paid for in advance, five yuan in total, which was contracted to He's family. People saw that his food and lodging were all provided by He's family, and thought that he was some kind of relative of He's family. A few days later, he said to He that the company staff had written yesterday, saying that they would come to the countryside to sell goods in a few days. He was very lonely these days. He didn't like gambling or prostitution, so he had very little entertainment and felt very bored. He XX saw that he was so young and prudent, gentle in his actions, capable in his work, and paid for the borrowed items and contracted meals in advance, so he praised him greatly and invited him to his home to play, in order to relieve his loneliness. When he came to He's house to play, he loved He's five-year-old child the most. Every time he came, he would bring a lot of candy and give it to the child to eat, so He's child was very welcoming and close to him when he came, and wanted him to hold him.</p>
<p>One day, he played with the child at He's house for a while, and then took the child back to his own place, saying that he would go home to find good toys for the young master to play with. He's family all said that he loved the child, and they were very happy in their hearts. Two hours later, the shop assistant from the XX Silk and Satin Shop in the east of the town suddenly ran to He's house and asked He XX, "Is the goods brought by your accountant Mr. Wang just now satisfactory?" He was stunned, where did the accountant Mr. Wang come from? He didn't send anyone to get silk and satin. He quickly asked the shop assistant, "What are you talking about?" The shop assistant was also a little puzzled in his heart. Their accountant had brought the young master to get things, why didn't his boss know? So he said anxiously, "At twelve o'clock, a man came to our shop, saying that he was your accountant Mr. Wang, and he was holding your young master in his arms, saying that your wife wanted to buy clothing materials. He immediately selected four pieces of expensive silk and satin, worth more than 150 yuan, saying that he would take them back and let your wife choose them herself. We saw that he was holding the young master, so of course we trusted that he was your accountant. The young master is someone we know, and besides, he said before leaving that he couldn't hold the young master after taking the goods, so he left the young master in our shop and asked us to take good care of him. Later, we waited for a long time and he didn't come, so the manager sent me to inquire. But this precious young master is in his arms, and it's clear that he's your accountant. Could he be a swindler? That would be strange! What's the young master doing in his hands?" When He XX heard this, he couldn't help but exclaim "Ah!" and shouted, "It's turned upside down, it's turned upside down, there is such a novel swindler in the world?" He then told the shop assistant the whole story of how the swindler started renting the house, and admitted his bad luck, admitting to compensating for the loss. He told the shop assistant to go and bring the child back. The shop assistant was also stunned and shocked.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Shanghai Has Faded <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Shu</p>
<p>Autumn is a solemn and terrible season. The sharp and cold autumn wind, everyone knows, cannot compare to the warmth and loveliness of the spring breeze. Moreover, from early autumn to mid-autumn to late autumn, in China, the thermometer only drops. Shanghai, full of the scent of flesh, has also greatly faded.</p>
<p>The iron-like facts prove that the women in our cities are the ladies and wives of the bourgeoisie. The lower class who have no rice to cook when washing pots are of course not included in this category. We have been deeply Westernized to some extent. Seeing the effect in the morning and evening, as long as it is novel and unique, and in line with respect, anything can be done. In terms of clothing: the patterns are constantly updated, colorful, simply dazzling, and breathtaking. It seems that if it is not like this, it is not enough to show its extravagance; if it is not like this, it is not enough to show its charm; if it is not like this, it is not enough to show its glory. Therefore, there is something to say.</p>
<p>The world of Shanghai women, women are the authority in Shanghai. Without them to support the scene, it would not be so lively. When summer comes, it is their time to be active and particularly active: arms are exposed, chests are exposed; the entire jade legs are worn without a thread, which can make people think of... Two of the most eye-catching small steamed buns lie vaguely in the thin gauze, shaking, shaking; the full buttocks, running, twist and sway rhythmically; the skin is white and tender, and all the curves are so sensual that they are really fascinating. Gentlemen of humanity see it, at least they will be furious and shout "Rebellion!" But this is ultimately a characteristic of modern urban civilization, this is a manifestation of the national spirit, this is their special right: Unfortunately, the autumn wind sends away the summer heat, and the weather has changed suddenly! Needless to say, they have also changed naturally. In addition to their fluffy, curly hair and beautiful faces, the middle and lower sections that can "captivate people" are completely covered by the fashionable and gorgeous clothes of 1933. In this</p>
<h3 id="e282">。······Then　take some sweet taste for you to taste Shiying?. <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Under the circumstances, people's respectful "attention ceremony" has temporarily lost its target, and perhaps they will feel the emptiness of life? Women who are accustomed to such a light life may feel a little dissatisfied in spirit?</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, to put it properly, Shanghai has faded, which is a real fact. But fading is temporary, not a permanent phenomenon. Will it not be their time to raise their eyebrows and breathe out and play all kinds of live dramas and "sacrifice their appearance" next summer? By that time, our "Revitalizing the Countryside" plan may "not yet succeed"; and Shanghai's "color" will not only surely be restored without any problems, but a rapid advance is also expected.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Flowery Words <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Shi An</p>
<p>If there are more comrades in short shirts than comrades in long shirts in China, then the country would not be in such a bad state. Because every comrade in a short shirt can produce for society, while comrades in long shirts ultimately consume more.</p>
<p>In the "tick-tock" of a second, you can lose your entire life, in this evil society. To get people to speak is like Granny Ping advocating going to sea; if you go to listen to her, you are sure to be disappointed.</p>
<p>Where there is happiness, there is trouble, where there is trouble, there is pain. Rich people are more likely to fall than poor people, because they only have the determination to go down, and no spirit to go up.</p>
<p>Prostitutes do not necessarily all fall voluntarily. Most of them are driven to depravity by the environment, and destroyed by society. Success gained through hardship is real, success gained through hypocrisy is accidental, because the former is forged by spirit, and the latter is bought with money. We should control money, not let money control us.</p>
<p>In order to win a woman's heart, men often do not hesitate to degrade their personality, and even lose everything because of it. Look, aren't most of the tourists in the amusement park and the dancers in the dance hall like this?</p>
<p>Someone said: "Why do stores use female waitresses?" I said: "She is a treasure for making money!"</p>
<p>When you are happy, you should think about the pain you suffered in the past. When you are suffering, you should look forward to the arrival of future happiness.</p>
<p>People say: "Women are men's playthings," I say: "Aren't men women's playthings?" Otherwise, why do men have to please women.</p>
<p>Invitation to a banquet for the whole family, a death notice sincerely declining condolences, are both requests for money.</p>
<p>Young masters and modern girls are just decorations for society. Perhaps society does not need them to exist.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Amateur Correspondence Box — Preparation <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a loyal reader of your newspaper, especially the Amateur Correspondence Box column. You always provide sincere answers to those who seek advice on difficult issues. From this, your enthusiastic service to society is evident. I have a matter to inquire about. If you could answer me soon, I would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>I have a relative with considerable savings, who now wishes to start a business in the handicraft industry. The problem is that he is not involved in this industry, so he knows nothing about the handicraft industry. He plans to have me learn a craft after my office hours (serving in a transportation agency), so that I can start a factory for him in the future after I have learned the craft. I am fortunate to be hardworking and capable of doing the job. However, I cannot leave my office during the day and can only learn after 6 PM. My relative has repeatedly urged me to inquire in detail and find out which craft, after I have learned it in the future, can be produced and sold well (i.e., has a market)? I have no choice but to trouble you, sir, to inquire in detail on my behalf: (1) Which craft has a large market? (2) Will factories be willing to hire me to learn the craft at night (i.e., after 6 PM)? (3) If I have no acquaintances to introduce me, is it possible to send a letter requesting admission? I respectfully wish you good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Yu Longsheng</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In these recessionary years, Yu's relative is not a miser and is willing to take out his savings</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>to start a factory. Although his motive is entirely for profit, it still makes a considerable contribution to people's livelihood. This matter is directly related to Yu's future and should be done to the best of his ability. It is also related to society and should receive support from all sides. Now, let us answer Yu's questions one by one:</p>
<p>(1) Our country is a country with backward production, and no industry is developed. You see, whether it is food, housing, clothing, or use, from airplanes costing tens of millions of yuan to iron nails costing a few copper coins, everything relies on imports. Therefore, our country can be said to be an industrial wasteland. As long as you are willing to do your best and the things you make are not inferior to foreign goods, then any industry has hope of development. Yu only needs to choose one that your relative's resources can afford and that your own ability can handle (Shanghai dialect meaning capable), and start preparing.</p>
<p>(2) The second question, as far as we know, is not welcomed by any factory. Unless you have considerable connections, it is almost impossible to succeed. Outside Xiaoximen, Lujiabang, our school, from this semester on, the day before yesterday, opened a mechanical subject cram school at night, which may be very suitable for the situation. We believe that in Yu's situation, it would be best to resign from your four-day job and go directly to the factory to practice; then, in the evening, go to the cram school to seek systematic knowledge from books. Although the income from work is not as high as it is now, your progress will be expected every day!</p>
<p>(3) As for the third question, you might as well try... It's good that there's no loss if it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Characters:</p>
<p>Chief of Police</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer</p>
<p>Police Officer A</p>
<p>Shop Owner</p>
<p>Other Police Officers</p>
<p>Setting: Very simple, a desk facing stage right,</p>
<p>Chief of Police sits at the desk, with the</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer standing beside him. Police Officer A and the Shop Owner stand</p>
<p>in front of the desk, with police officers guarding them on both sides.</p>
<p>Chief of Police: Uh-hem (A nasal sound, this is how adults start a</p>
<p>conversation), why are you fighting? Don't</p>
<p>you know it's against the law? (A very</p>
<p>faint, simultaneous sound coming from both of them:</p>
<p>"Yes, we know.")</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer: (To Police Officer A) You, explain, why were you fighting?</p>
<p>Police Officer A: (At attention) I was getting a haircut in his shop, and</p>
<p>his staff stuck something on my head.</p>
<p>I reasoned with him, but they all colluded and said</p>
<p>they weren't wrong...</p>
<p>Shop Owner: Great Officer, have mercy! I really wasn't wrong.</p>
<p>It's a two-cent stamp! It's a two-cent</p>
<p>stamp! ...</p>
<p>Chief of Police: (As if interested) A two-cent stamp?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Shop Owner: Yes! My staff didn't stick it on wrong,</p>
<p>Great Officer, it's a two-cent stamp! The truth</p>
<p>is... it's just...</p>
<p>Chief of Police: Why did your staff stick a stamp on his (pointing</p>
<p>to Police Officer A) head?</p>
<p>Police Officer A: He shouldn't have stuck it on my head!</p>
<p>Chief of Police: (Reprimanding) Shut your stinky, sweaty mouth! I didn't</p>
<p>ask you!</p>
<p>Shop Owner: It happened a few days ago. My shop received Great</p>
<p>Officer's orders, saying that all shops, big and small, must</p>
<p>affix a stamp worth two percent. Think about it, Great Officer,</p>
<p>we barbers don't issue receipts, so where</p>
<p>do we stick the stamp? If we don't stick it, we'll be fined,</p>
<p>so we had no choice but to stick it on the customers' heads.</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer: (Unable to contain his laughter, glances at the Chief</p>
<p>as a signal, and then stops)</p>
<p>Shop Owner: My staff stuck a two-cent stamp because</p>
<p>we charged the customer twenty cents (small coin), we were just afraid</p>
<p>we didn't get a signature, right?...</p>
<p>Chief of Police: Well, hey, let me tell you, no matter what, you</p>
<p>shouldn't have fought him...</p>
<p>Shop Owner: He was the one who started it.</p>
<p>Chief of Police: It's all the same (to Police Officer A) why did you hit</p>
<p>someone?</p>
<p>Police Officer A: I, I...</p>
<p>Chief of Police: (To Police Officer A) Next time when you're inspecting stamps,</p>
<p>don't just go around hitting people. Give him twenty</p>
<p>strikes to the palm, as a warning for next time. (To the Shop Owner) You</p>
<p>fought with someone, disturbed the peace of this station,</p>
<p>fine of ten dollars. If you don't pay, you will do hard labor, two days</p>
<p>off each dollar. Court adjourned!</p>
<p>Inspecting Officer: (To the Chief of Police) I think we should change the name of</p>
<p>the stamp tax later!...</p>
<p>Chief of Police: (Getting up, nodding) Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p>Shop Owner: I didn't do anything wrong! I didn't do anything wrong! (While yelling, being dragged</p>
<p>offstage by the police).</p>

<h3 id="e289">How to Cultivate Our Little Sister <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Renwei</p>
<p>Someone said: "The crystallization of 20th-century culture can be found in ice cream and movies." Indeed, ice cream is the only blessing people have in the sweltering heat, and like ice cream, movies are praised by modern people for their vigorous vitality. It is often said that movies are the little sister of the arts. Although she is young, she is extremely intelligent. Her sister arts, such as drama, music, and painting, originated thousands of years ago or more. Only this little sister, cinema, can be regarded as a product of the late 19th century. Judging from the current situation in various countries around the world, although movies have surpassed others, the dangers ahead are startling.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other things, let’s look at Hollywood, which claims to hold the reins of the world’s film industry. Since the invention of sound films, on the one hand, it has been devastated by economic influences, and it has had no choice but to passively lay off employees and reduce salaries, and desperately economize in terms of quantity and quality; on the other hand, the decline of screenwriters and directors has led to the use of boring content to cater to the interests of low-level audiences. Therefore, current productions are truly surprisingly disappointing compared to the golden age of silent films before 1930. But this is where the problem arises: what method can be used to reverse this crisis?</p>
<p>In the tide of modern social thought, what we demand of movies is, of course, popularization. However, popular movie works, if not handled carefully, will degenerate into entertainment products that cater to low-level tastes and lose the inherent nature of true works of art; because the depravity of general tastes is so widespread, American films are all uniformly manufactured to cater to this inferior taste, so the film industry should first realize that this inferior taste should be transformed; at the same time, it should also take on the responsibility of "educational movies" to guide the tastes of the general public in society and gradually improve them; therefore, movie producers should, in addition to planning money, have a spirit of love for art and minimize the low-level and provocative scenes in the films they direct, to the point of "non-existence," so that the goal of improving general interest can be achieved.</p>
<p>Chinese movies are still in the embryonic stage in terms of skills, sets, and equipment, and of course, they cannot yet catch up with the grandeur and meticulousness of Western movies; but what we need now is not these superficial spectaculars, but realistic life issues and social central issues. Recently, there have been several "Interviews with Chinese Movie Performers" by Mr. Shaji in this publication. The words of several directors are very pertinent. I hope that they can all work hard to do what they say. Here, I would also like to offer a little advice: that is, we should use the nectar of art to irrigate this bud that is about to bloom; didn't I say above that the movie is not the youngest little sister? Then, I very much hope that the Chinese little sister will not be as aristocratic as the foreign little sister. We want to turn the profound into the simple, the rigid into the flexible, and the tasteless into the interesting; however, popularization is not vulgarization, simplification is definitely not monotonous, flexibility is not just frivolousness, and making it interesting is definitely not just acting out meaningless comedies. In short, we must stand on the position of art to cultivate our young little sister.</p>

<h3 id="e290">Saying a Few Words for "Dawn" <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Yu</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jixing Company's "Dawn" was shown for the first day in this city. I braved the drizzle and went to the Beijing Grand Theater. This so-called "small company" production of "Dawn" gave me many good impressions. When I read the overly harsh criticisms in the newspapers this morning (November 6), I was very willing to say a few words for it, especially regarding the points of "Review of Dawn" signed "Yu" in today's Shenbao Movie Special, I have a slightly different opinion. (The "Yu" of the day is not Sun Yu. Editor's note) Regarding the mediocrity and inferiority of the sets and photography, and the negligence caused by the director's rush for time, I believe that movie critics should try their best to point them out, and at the same time, they should actually experience the difficulties of small companies with relatively less financial resources, and give sympathetic encouragement to the producer's honest efforts.</p>
<p>"Dawn" takes the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist struggles of farmers and workers in Huangcun as its theme, alluding to the volunteer army in the Northeast who risked their lives to resist Japan, or the farmers and workers who secretly helped the volunteer army. Although at the end of the film, they only killed twenty or thirty enemies and shouted victory, losing the seriousness of anti-imperialism, the anti-imperialist enthusiasm and anti-enemy vigor of this film are worth instilling into many decadent Chinese people.</p>
<p>I feel that the producers of "Dawn" did not write about love as being above all else. He Sanbao, the anti-enemy leader in the film, did not organize the people to resist the enemy because of A Wei. Although A Xiang in the film pursues A Wei's love, when he raises his gun and attempts to assassinate his love rival, he realizes and transforms. Although his resistance to the enemy is driven by love, his transformation is not for the sake of A Wei's love, but for the sake of the "sincere unity" that everyone swears to. This is worth our attention.</p>
<p>"Dawn" undoubtedly portrays He Sanbao, the leader of the resistance against the enemy, too much like an ideal hero. But we cannot deny that it is necessary to organize farmers or miners to resist the enemy and oppose imperialism, and to have people who lead and command everything. In "Dawn" we also saw the masses who continued to resist even when the ammunition was exhausted, but the producers of "Dawn" should not have portrayed the glorious victory so easily; it should be more serious and more extensive, and there should be a more practical expression of the needs and actions of the miners who automatically rose up to resist.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Review of "Dawn" <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Jue</p>
<p>Needless to say, this "Dawn" is another work produced along with the tide of transformation. The theme is similar to "Blood Road." Both films are led from love to resistance against the enemy, but they are both very unnatural. However, it is gratifying that this serious realistic theme has been seized.</p>
<p>The beginning of "Dawn" is about the love triangle between A Xiang, A Wei, and He Sanbao. The Huangcun on the screen is full of harmony and comfortable atmosphere. In the middle of the story, an enemy attack suddenly intrudes, but the development of the plot is too rigid. What is ridiculous is that dozens of farmers with earthen guns and exhausted ammunition actually annihilated the enemy's army. Obviously, this kind of story is all fantasized.</p>
<p>A Xiang in the play is a weak person who is greedy for life and afraid of death, and cannot forget women for a moment. He Sanbao is a brave and capable young man. As a result, He Sanbao is loved by A Wei, and A Xiang finally dies. This powerful contrast shows the decline of the weak and the victory of the brave. This suggestion is worth praising. But the performance is a failure, especially in several war scenes. Dozens of earthen guns facing the enemy, and when the ammunition is exhausted, they even use rice pots and nailed shoes as bullets. How ridiculous is this!</p>
<p>Also, the application of "open spears" and "hidden arrows" is also very clumsy. Can a person who raises a gun to kill his love rival still care about this kind of creed? Moreover, "only open spears are allowed to fight, and no hidden arrows are allowed to hurt people" is too ancient knightly style. When A Wei encountered a giant beast and escaped to a tree, she was clearly wearing black shorts and barefoot, but the shot of the giant beast at the edge of the tree showed A Wei's trouser legs turned into white trouser legs and white shoes. This is carelessness in borrowing from foreign films.</p>
<p>Yinyuan Wang Feijuan has a few places where her actions are too metropolitanized, but her expression is acceptable. Zhang Yuting is dominated by the plot, and his performance is like an extraordinary hero. Wang Chunyuan and other actors have nothing outstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e292">After Watching "Lihantian" <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>A division commander's daughter falls in love with a stable groom. Perhaps this kind of deformed story arises from a remote ideal. There are young ladies who fall in love with coachmen or grooms, but how does it happen? The division commander's daughter already has an opponent who is a staff officer, but she still lingers on the groom. In fact, the structure of this kind of drama material is too illusory, and it has become a big flaw in this inexplicable Land Temple of Departure.</p>
<p>The story has already caused a big mistake, and of course it is not easy to please the director. In many places, there are deficiencies due to economic constraints, incomplete scale, and environmental limitations, which we need to forgive. However, how could a division commander's side have such close self-defense, and how could he be easily killed by a groom? This kind of shortcoming cannot be said to be a small company and be forgiven.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Lu Fuyao is too pretentious. Qian Siying is also reluctant. There is nothing else to say. In short, this type of film is in fact not considered suitable for the times. As for sadness and stubbornness, it is not necessarily worth mentioning. However, the economy and environment of small companies are extremely difficult. Of course, it cannot be compared with Lei Menolova's "Lihantian." Finally, I hope that this kind of material that is not suitable for the times should be used less.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Tianyi's New Film "Flame of Youth" <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>"Flame of Youth" is directed by Qiu Qixiang, starring Chen Yumei, and co-starring Ye Qiuxin, Wang Huijuan, and Yu Guang. It is Tianyi Company's silent blockbuster of this year. Everything in the film is particularly exquisite. Speaking of costumes alone, the entire play has cost more than 3,000 yuan. It is said that the costumes of the leading role Ye Qiuxin alone are more than 30 sets. The film has a magnificent living room set, and the construction time is more than a week. It was only completed the day before yesterday. Now the interior scenes have been completed. The exterior scenes, yesterday, Qiu Qixiang has led the staff to Hangzhou to shoot. If the weather is good and the work is not hindered, it will return to Shanghai within a week.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Cheng Bugao's "Written" and "Directed" First Shot <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Bugao, the director of "Mad Current," "Manjianghong," and "Chunqun," recently wrote a "Tongchou" script himself, using the Northern Railway as the background and love events as the interweaving. It is said that this film was compiled by Cheng Bugao from the lessons learned from the two films "Manjianghong" and "Chuncun." All aspects can meet the principles of popularization.</p>
<h3 id="e295">"Salt Tide" Completed <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>The "Salt Tide," which was completed after eight trips on the road to Huhang, is now being edited by director Xu Xinfu. According to Miss Hu Die Gu Meijun Lanjun, in order to shoot the location scenes of "Salt Tide," they worked barefoot on the beach for more than ten days, making sacrifices. They also said that they only hoped that the results would be satisfactory, then they would not have sacrificed in vain.</p>

<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>Marx did come in, followed by the producer Stern Gill. Marx introduced the two of them. Stern Gill was an affable middle-aged man with some gray hair, but his eyes were bright and he was indeed a versatile man. Lawrence Renaud's drunkenness had gradually subsided. He only felt that he was the great Lawrence Renaud, and the other party was just a small producer and merchant. Marx was a clear-sighted bystander. He noticed Lawrence's decline and felt very sad. He wanted to advise him, but Lawrence did not listen to him at all. He talked endlessly about everything, confusing Stern Gill. Later, when it came to the topic, he was also bragging by himself, not letting Stern Gill say a word. He told Stern Gill that he was Lawrence Renaud, and his name could sell money. He said that he did not want to be a supporting role for the British; if Stern Gill wanted to invite him to join, the role must be given more weight, and his salary would be eight thousand dollars a week; in the silent film era, he could get at least ten thousand. He also said to Stern Gill: "Don't think that you are helping me... Who wants to play a small role in your bad movie... I am still helping you!" When Stern Gill heard this, he stood up and said, "It's too late, I'm afraid I'll delay your dinner." He said goodbye. Marx tried to keep Stern Gill, saying that Lawrence's words did not count. Lawrence said, "How can my words not count? I don't care about Stern Gill's movies. I am still a great star, and I haven't changed at all!" Stern Gill said, "Okay, Mr. Renaud, goodbye." Marx still wanted to stop him, but Stern Gill said, "Okay, we'll see you tomorrow."</p>
<p>After Marx waited for Stern Gill to leave, he turned around and said to Renaud, "You drunkard!" Renaud said, "Get out of here!" Of course, Marx wanted to get out of here, but before leaving, he said to Renaud, "I don't know how much effort I spent helping you. I have never worked so hard for a second person; but now, I won't mention it, and I won't blame you anymore, because... I'm too worried about you!" Renaud said, "What a joke! What are you worried about me for?" Marx said, "No matter where I go, people laugh at me and give me a nickname, calling me "Maxi the grave watcher." No matter what theater I go to, I get turned down everywhere for you. Yesterday I even sent a telegram to Hollywood. I knew it was useless, but I sent it anyway. Okay, here's a reply!" He threw the telegram at Renaud, and the telegram fell on the ground. Renaud said, "I don't want to see it, you're using it to scare me." Marx calmly said to him, "Let me tell you the truth.</p>
<p>You're finished. You've never been a real actor, but because you have a good appearance, but now appearance is not popular anymore. Take a look in the mirror yourself! Your eyelids are drooping, like an old woman's. You're finished, whether it's movies, stage, radio, variety shows, whatever, there's no place for you. Go! Crawl into the tomb!" (To be continued)</p>
