<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國金融恐慌與世界經濟</h3>
<p>㈠金融恐慌之主因　　擁有黄金四十億美金以上之北美合衆國。有黄金國之名。世界第一次大戰而後。乃穩執世界金融之牛耳。雖練遠之英國。亦瞠乎其後。不敢與爭。然自一九二九年秋。股票價格崩落以來。雖在恐慌浪潮激盪之中。尙能勉强撑持。敷衍塲面。而本年二月底。卽發生重大裂痕。初由地方開始。「米西干州」全部銀行。宣吿停業。不及一週。遂延及於全美國。</p>
<p>多金之美。何以發生如許巨大風潮。其爲人心不定。羣起提欵以致银行信用失墮耶。其實提欵之舉。不過一道火線耳。並不足以引起全美之恐慌。甚至波及於全世界也。茲僅就一般重要因由。分述如次。</p>
<p>第一·對外投資無法收回。歐洲大戰之後。美國遂取英國支配世界經濟地位而代之。其對海外投資。總數在一百五十七億以上。而對歐洲各國之戰債。尙不在内。自經濟恐慌瀰漫世界以還。各國農業恐慌。相繼而起。匪特德國總統發出經濟的危險信號。全歐震動已也。戰債賠欵停付一年之提議。見諸實行後。仍未有絲毫轉機。世界經濟。反而愈加惡化。南美諸國一一宣佈無力償還外債。於是乎美國海外之長期投資。固一時不易收回。即短期信用亦陷於週轉失靈之狀態中。</p>
<p>第二·戰債償還。由爭執而陷於停頓。歐洲諸國。除英法意而外。多無力支付。即以英法而論。亦係取諸他人以償美。如法則恃賠欵。英則以各國對英之戰償。現在賠欵。旣經洛桑會議决定而停付。則戰債勢必撤消。於是形成去年年底北美合衆國與歐洲之對立。其後英意雖聲明付欵。其不肯繼續支付之意。已甚明瞭。且旣償還美債。亦無不索他國欠英戰債之理。法比等國。始終堅持不付。於是全屬證劵之戰債。遂影響於美國市塲。信用擔保（以戰債爲擔保所發行之各種證劵）乃全部動摇矣。</p>
<p>第三·生産過剩。市塲窄小。産業合理化運動盛行。美國産業之生産力。愈益擴大。然同時帶來一般消費力縮小。蓋産業合理化之實現。乃機械力發逹。人工减少。反之則爲失業工人慢性增加。以失業之人。安得維持生命以外之消費力。—則一般購買力衰落。即伏因於此。漸次蔓延。遂使其國内市塲。日趨頽廢。加以關稅壁壘高築。國與國間之界限日深。美國乃更難求市塲於海外矣。益以殖民地半殖民地各國民族資本之抬頭。欲市塲擴張。幾不可能。</p>
<p>第四。選舉競爭之激刺市面。當選舉競爭之日。共和黨爲刺激人心。挽回頺運起見。乃政治方法。用之於市塲。使股票提高。使産業界興奮。故去七·八·九·三個月中。衰頽市面。逐漸回復。而十一月以後。又向下跌落。新總統選定後。興奮作用消除。疲勞景象立至。</p>
<p>㈡對世界之反應</p>
<p>美國金融恐慌。旣已遍満全國。影響所及。恐不止南北美洲已也。蓋美國據世界金融王座。於今十有餘年。歐洲各國。無論英法。均皆處於次位。受美金之領導。雖世界經濟恐慌狂潮所至。英國亦且放擲其金本制度。採取通貨膨脹政策。抑壓貨幣價格。提高物價惟美國則仍舊貫。不爲稍動。但經此次風潮之後。縱令羅斯福總統。運其敏腕。以政治方策。制馭經濟恐慌之發展。然苟不能消除上節所述之前三種原因。（開拓新投資市塲解决戰債—收回戰債。擴大國内外之購買能力）則收效最多。不過短時中壓平風潮已耳。且限制現金出囗。甚至禁止出口。取締私人儲藏現金諸端。見諸實施。亦不過維持金本位制。變相之通貨膨脹政策也。歐洲大陸之法蘭西。受經濟恐慌之影響雖較小。其生産指數。比之一九二八年。亦僅百分之七十四。經此次狂潮激盪。其能必保持金本位乎。英國誠能亟力保守。或將奮其資力。奪回原有地位。然而海外市塲狹小。國内失業工人。無法消除。亦難免不暴露其弱點也。日本對美國金融關係。處於相當不利地位。生絲消售。將因此次風潮而大受打撃。出口貿易。勢將縮小三分之一。以至二分之一。不過美國忙於鎭定金融恐慌。日本乃得從容侵略我國。故熱河用兵。列國明知之而不發一言。美國明知之而以喘息不定。亦默無表示。是以在經濟上。美國金融恐慌。給日本以惡劣影響。而政治上則適相反。竟助成日本之横行也。</p>
<p>然則今後之傾向又將何如。美國産業資本家受經濟恐慌之打撃。欲脫出此窮廹境遇。另關新途徑乃不能歡迎「物價提高。」換言之即。採取通貨膨脹政策。停止金本位是也。然而與産業資本處於對立之銀行資本。固執反對「通貨膨脹政策」之意見。緃令産業各部門與夫内外貿易極度惡化。銀行家亦必不肯低頭於「通貨膨脹政策」这下。况美國金融資本與産業資本相較。實居優勢。豈肯容易贊同停止金本位者。不過一般經濟情勢日趨惡化。銀行資本。亦不得不相對讓步。結局乃採取戰時緊急處置。禁止金輸出。而仍不放棄金本位制度。後果何如。殊　得吾人之深切注意與研究也。</p>

<p>當局將繼續會談、大約法外長彭古亦將於星期五晚間離巴黎、至總理達拉弟是否亦赴日内瓦、則不得而知、據國務院人員傅說、法總理赴日内瓦與否、必俟星期五英法當局會談時、始能决定、</p>

<h3>朱懋澄談考查歐美實業經過</h3>
<p>申時電訊社本埠消息、國府特派考查各國特使孔祥熙氏、及其重要隨員朱懋澄·許建平·等、於前日抵滬、申時社記者、昨訪朱氏於其寓邸、晤談頗久、對於此番考查任務、經過路綫、歐美各國現况、及中日問題等項、均有述及、茲分誌於次、</p>
<p>（考查任務）朱氏言、此次孔特使（報載專便、名稱非確、）受命赴歐美各國考查實業狀况、對於農工商業勞工及經濟狀况、均在考查之内所經各地、參觀其農工商業各項組織、探訪各重要實業機關、與各社團接洽　並隨時隨地作個人各則之研究、遇有機緣、便將我國近來各項進步之實情、以及政府對改進國内各種羣業之計劃、向各國人士宣傅、俾克了解而獲同情、以收合作之效果、孔特使之聲譽地位、及其待人接物誠懇和藹之精神、確能引起各方好感、所經各地、備受歡迎、而吾人所得、亦非淺少、至全團組織、孔特使以下、本人（朱氏自述）任技監兼事務主任、許建平氏任參贊、李儻氏任秘書、鄭祖穆氏任警官、兼衛生考察員、於孔氏指揮下、分工合作、計此行中各國人士對吾種種合作表示、及今回思、殊覺愉快也、　　（經過路線）自九月二日、吾人一行、自上海動身、二十日經檀香山、抵三藩市、至聖路易、芝加哥、而抵紐約、由紐約至華盛頓、重返紐約、再赴紐約赫芬、往哈提福特、加利福尼亞、第速萊特、復返紐約、計在美勾留至十二月十八日、始赴歐洲、於一月五日、首逹德之漢堡、卽赴柏林、轉往耶森、遍歴歐堡好司、第騷達夫、可羅芬、巴色地、而至日内瓦、而後抵法之利澭、巴黎、納哈佛、轉往比京、由安樂佛至荷之海牙、再往安勃斯坦、輾轉而達英倫、更歷孟德斯鳩、赫德十發爾、林肯、納士登、撥法亞、返倫敦後、赴貝安、入意大利國境之條林、吉羅瓦、羅馬、米蘭、維尼斯、乘輪赴比林狄沙、乃離歐往埃及經亞力山大、開羅、由蘇彝士河、渡紅海、而至印度、經歷孟買、哥倫布、新加坡、過香港、而返上海、計歷時半載　原擬再赴蘇俄因在歐時、孔特使迭接國内去電催歸、致未能親往、但亦已另派他人前去矣、</p>
<p>（世界經濟）此行對世界經濟大勢、頗得深刻之印象、現在自表面上看來、歐美各邦凡屬産業國、均有生産過剩之勢、然歐美工商業實際、已凋敝不堪、致世界均受其影響、吾人對歐美各産業國之工商各業、取法之處固多、然其不良處亦應知所避免、蓋我國一般社會經濟狀况、較彼邦尤屬不如、若遭此種擾亂、則其禍患當尤不堪設想、近晚歐美經濟大加衰落、若非親往考察、或有難於置傖者、卽以素號金圓機威之美國而言、孰不知其爲舉世最富之國家、但就吾人此番實地觀察所及、則其國内工廠、多有停閉、生産大見减少、竟至不及前三四年總額三分之一、其原因最大者、卽係股票買賣毫無限制、其價値漲落至堪騖驚人、在理固足便人　富、嘗有一種股票、忽然增價達九百六十倍者、但其所隷屬之工廠或公司、實際資本、並未隨之增多、復次自由競賣之風旣盛、則每使生産過剩、而致互競領銷、例如一工人原無餘財可置一汽車、但因購汽車可以分期付欵、則儘可將其未來工資、挪抵於目前、於是物質享樂蒸蒸日上、勃發而不可遏止、一時貨品銷路、確能增多、但此種暫的購買力终屬有限、一旦因金融周轉不靈、銷路呆滯、則工廠或公司、卽紛紛停閉、於是失業者數量、隨之而增、失業者愈多、購買力愈弱、而實業之停閉、亦愈見加增、此中互爲因果、直至崩潰而不可收拾、及今全美有失業者一千二百餘萬、連其家眷人口計算、則平均當在四千萬左右、實業旣衰歇、股票價格自落、於是昔之暴富者、今則暴窮、出品雖痛加貶價以求出售、但失業衆多、無人顧問、乃演成今日工業農業各品、多所廢棄、而貧窮人又多無飯吃之怪現象也、此種潮流、直捲撼於各銀行、銀行平素投資放欵、因實業衰落、而虧蝕、雖有甚多之實業團體、已向法院淸理、但終無法足挽頽局也、加以新式自動機器之發明、足以代替多數人、失業風潮、爰乃愈演愈重矣、社會金融、常呈不穏、銀行一遇擠兌、便無法應付、故目前美國各銀行、有暫停兌現之命令、其他最有關係者、又莫若關稅政策之爲崇　因各國爲各保市塲計、均高築關稅壁壘、卽素稱自由貿易之英國、亦捲入此種潮流、夫己國之貨品、旣不能自由出口、則出路愈見阻絶、一面恐慌、一面又積極擴充武備其結果國家預算不能收支相抵、則其恐慌愈日見擴大、卽英德法各强國、其情勢亦均大同小異、按其根本弊病、實起於不知節制資本、此世界和平、及人類文明均有密切關係、實不能等關視之、</p>
<p>（中日問題）吾人行蹝所至、輙有人以中日糾紛問題見訽、必答以中國絶非向人乞憐其他人代爲出力、以抵抗橫蠻無理之日本、僅希望各國各負其條約上應盡之責任、尤其是關係國聯盟約非戰公約及九國公約之簽字國、日本之侵略、對中國固屬利害切膚、而各有關係國若只漠視不加干涉、則實屬背約也、且今日東亞糾紛、亦卽有關於世界經濟、實一極重大之問題、日本處心積慮、佔領我東北富源、非特爲解决其本國經濟之困窘、實亦將藉以遂其征服世界之野心、日本在先固唱東省門户開放主義、但其所謂門户、實只由彼木屣出入擁擠不堪、外人固無揷足餘地也、中國今日將遵循孫中山先生手訂之原則、在保守主權之下、歡迎與各友邦合作、開發原有之富源、俾世界經濟漸趨穩定、不致積重難返、日瀕於危亡、但此種偉業、於進行之前、自必首須剷餘壟斷者之阻礙、且日本一味橫蠻、只知憑武力謀侵略、如果聽任其成功、則世界之恐慌、勢將靡有己時、而謀世界和平之計劃、如軍縮會者、直等於夢想而已、</p>

<h3>生活及其他</h3>
<p>——馬鑾君訊</p>
<p>現在的社會上，逢人便掽着經濟衰落，生活艱困的話頭。其實社會經濟的衰落，與有錢人生活，並不受顯著的影響；反過來說：就是社會的經濟不衰落，窮人的生活也没有解决的辦法。不待說，因爲我這個窮人，日常所接近的多是些窮人，所以到處閙着生計的恐慌。先生，我現在所處的環境，是不容易拿幾張紙來形容盡改的；我現在的危難自己無法自救！我曾聽人家告訴我說過，我的爸爸窮窘的時候，還要比　更甚，但他那時不知怎様能奮鬥出困苦的境地？夠生養我長大？雖然我很要知道他的生活過程和人生的經騐，但他已經逝世，不能再做我的顧問啦。人心是怎様的人心？窮苦的人是到處被人欺落的：雖然國難至此，舊社會裏奸刁的惡習，輕貧重富的心理，並不因此受細些的影響；各個自顧自的風氣，到底還是存在着。　智識和新文化，不過是　幼　的人世未深的小學生實受到了一點，但到了一十歲中年時代，不免又要燻染到舊社會的惡習，循環相因，是永無澈底的，眞準的平衡的新中國，不知何日以實現囉。先生，現在的我，一切的一切都不願去研冘，抑亦無寗的心緒不欲去研究：我唯一的仰望，就是生計的維持。追求，探討，拼命的壽覓，終謀不到一線生活的機能。那載不住的廣告，尤其是待取的廣告，我有四五次的嘗試，結果我是失望；於什麽招請職員啦，聘請敎授啦，我都往前去應徴過啦：不知耗掉了多少車資和郵費，結果徒增加我的懊恨和失望。就是現在給先生的　封信，除寄送的郵資外，　須附回信郵資五分：今天到郵局裏寄信時，我給了二十個銅子，買十分郵票，那是誰也以爲是不錯的，但那位郵票櫃上的傢伙，偏要我二十一枚哪！在我的爸爸才逝世以前，因爲他　年的遭遇梢佳，便接到一個省府民政廳第　科的　員，每個月有八十塊錢的酬俸，　様雖然　能　着平　的日子：不過他的晚運很促，不到九個月便就病了。他原想把我也　到民政廳裏去找飯吃，但他病了之後日重一日，終於未曾把我执放妥安，棄世而去了！我寫到這裏不免又流淚！現在的我旣失掉了賺錢的爸爸，不待說，窮困日促，朋友親戚皆疏絶了：莫說推　　體，就是接濟二角小洋的伙食也無人肯應啦！這個不景氣的年頭，僥倖國難不臨到江蘇，還能出入於典當的門檻裏討生活；如果像去年滬戰的時光，這裏典當門關得緊騰騰的，不知要如何危難耶！雖然如此的遭難，討飯嗎？這條没出息的路是决計不願去走的；不過，拿質家來的幾個錢，無論如何不能維持永久的生活的。這幾天格外的計算着用度，除買些可以繼命的東西，當做山珍海味那様的重視的來大餐人嚼，此外是不肯妄耗半文的。并且還利用質當砲餐的日子，天天的圖書館裏過淸淡的生活，好似書中自有黃金屋」找尋的那様的迷惑的下去，我並非不知道「書中自有黃金屋」這句話，也是和報上招請廣告同様的　不件；但窮窘的環境，已到了最後怱促的時候了，我相信世界上任何一個聰明的人，到了這個時候，也想不出可走的路線啦。如果不借着任何物質來　耤精神上的愁悶；那這顆焦急的心，必至破碎。　亂的思想，足以影響精神上的顢狂：因爲精神上的顢狂，便作出偷盜勒贖的妄爲：因爲味法的妄爲，便須受身體上的刑罰。如果精神和身體兩受損壞　，那麽更有什麽法子可想呢？所以我窮雖窮·而不作窮字的偏面歪想。不過我俟機會去請求他人的解决辦法是無時或忘的！我很冒昧的來　求你們精神上的指導！請求你們將我從地獄裏拯救出來，領導到天堂路上去！因爲我自信仰望人類的援助！就使精神上的指導吧！終能獲　相當的實惠的。若求鬼神　竊的愚夫愚婦，纔無人去和牠們表同情而予以實惠呀！</p>
<p>答；來信讀罷，略復如左；足下第一段話說得很混亂，並没有人希望社會經濟的衰落去解决窮人的生活。並因此使有錢人的生活受影響。因爲這是整個的社會經濟組織之變革的問題。這是一。你所叙的你的身世，我們只有對之表示無限的同情，我們只有咀咒這個無情的，冷酷的，現社會！這是二。其他恕不具答，惟有一事應鄭重聲明者；本欄同人學識　陋，所恃者惟　一念之誠與讀者相周旋，冀以爝火之光，接引讀者於光明之路，力薄願宏，明知不濟，時懼無以答讀者大衆的期望之殷，而且我們自己也並未住在天堂，也就始没有什麽天堂的觀念，自始就没有要到天堂的迷夢。我們只想在地獄中大家聯合起來，做個孫悟空，黑旋風或是魯智深，就是說，我們只想打倒現在的地獄，在這個地獄的　墟上建造我們的自由的王國。假使眞有天堂的話，那這裏就是天堂了，你所希望我們的，實在不敢當。這不是客氣而是實話，我們的腦海裏是始終不讓什麽「天堂」和「地獄」這種觀念來支配的。</p>

<p>鍾勇森</p>
<p>排球大將守門</p>
<p>曁南之守門、爲前遠東代表、排球大將徐亨、最惹人注意、曁南在嚴重壓迫之下、守門救出之球不少、下半時有二次着地而</p>
<p>來之急球、均爲徐一仆而得救、精彩可觀、上來之高球、徐亦人施其排球好身手、惜精於担、而不慣於接、故峙有角球造成、而帶危險性、大救不差守衛以江善敬最賣力、梁廣皆可觀、阿伽爾不能如何得意者、守衛之功、前鋒無攻門人才、大爲可惜、總之守勝於攻、表演　意、</p>
<h3>三次大好機會</h3>
<p>上塲　十分鐘中、曁南有三次極好機會、可中而不中、眞可暵惜、否則或能一鳴驚人、改變局面、不及三鐘、裁判卽鳴笛開球、阿伽爾卽取　攻、將曁南團團圍住、全力以攻、曁南力守、陣地無變、一刻鐘後、曁南突出重圍、鍾勇森自右邊速進、阿伽爾二衛不知所措、傳至門前、海光不曾射中、此爲一次、　而王南珍得來球、又向左邊飛進、傳至門首、竟無一能舉足攻門、三四盤旋、羅又未射準、此其二、第三次鍾勇森再自有進、羅海光在敵門的接應、離門十碼、對門而射、竟斜出門外尺許、此具一也、</p>
<h3>一漏遂失一球</h3>
<p>曁南先受壓迫、辦復失此三次好機會、然士氣稍見振作、敵軍陣地、時施進攻、在半小時後、符和黃與王南珍並馬而進、將及門前、海司的前衝而踼出、右翼李特遂得之而飛進、陳鎭祥一失、李特更如飛　進、賴作榮從後追之、李特一脚傳中、惠列砰然蹴入、無從逃避、阿伽爾先得一球好不容易、曁南再度反攻、江善敬曾上前違攻一次、雖中球門、但落於守門手、上半時結果、阿伽爾一比零先勝、</p>
<h3>下半時又一隻</h3>
<p>下半時曁南不如上半時之勇、力似己衰、阿伽爾表演、亦忝精彩攻門好機會、失去者亦有二三次、江善敬一次在阿伽爾有的離門三十碼踼任意球、幾乎中的、此　大砲願能令人一振、但曁南前鋒力傳、　知機會不多、十分鐘際、休士自左邊來曁、盧抵門首、徐亨衝出、不意休士脚趾一挑、球成一高　抛物線、而徐亨之頂、落入門内、阿伽爾再勝一雙、全局卽以二比零完結、</p>

<h3>水裏來湯裏去</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>—經濟學格言—</p>
<p>美國是　號世界第一大高國。它所以能成富翁，千句并一句，就因爲它生産得多，可將剩餘的生産品，傾銷到各國去，吸收人家的現金。但是近二三年來！這位富翁所開的銀行，陸續　倒閉了許多。到了今年，不得了，全國四十八州裏，大大小小，高高矮矮的銀行，像同盟罷工般地擱淺的擱淺，觸礁的觸礁，沉没的沉没，滿城風雨，關得那位擇吉登臺，走馬上任的羅斯福老先生，手忙脚亂，啼笑皆非。這位富翁的弄成這一副嘴臉，據一般頭頂方帽子的專家，用顯微鏡研究所得的結果說，也爲了生産得多。生産得多果然可把剩餘的生産品傾銷出去，發一筆洋財。可是生産得多，而各國的吃客，都害着不消化病，胃口不佳，無法消納，那未，非但發不到洋財，竟做了偷鷄不着蝕把米的生意，於是乎不得人尴尬而特尴尬了。我們中國有一句話，呌做水裏來：湯裏去，即是一句顚撲不破的經濟學格言。</p>
<p>我們的高鄧日本，整天的嚷着没有原料，不能同人家比一比究竟誰高，所以拼命的大陸發展。它以爲有了生産品的原料，就不難去吸收世界的金錢，發洋財而爲富翁。但是我們要知道地球是有範圍的，地球上的人口是有一定數量的。一定數量的人口，總不能消化掉高出一定數量的貨物。日本呑了東北，儘着一想情願的想多生産，在這全世界閙着經濟破産的年頭兒，難保不做到水裏没有來、湯裏已經去的那一步。到那時，雖然急得雙脚跳，也是徒然的了。</p>
<h3>遇見故宮古物</h3>
<p>— 夏大吾</p>
<p>今天風很大啊—</p>
<p>幾天以前報上載着故宮古物的新聞，關係這些寳貝的存放問題，猶豫了好久，原說將搬運到洛陽西安存放，忽覺這二處地方不妥，又說已在法租界方面租定了前仁濟醫院舊址，已經由某某工程師知照某營造廠將該處四周的鋼窗地位，都把水泥堵塞，但古物原在浦口，而聞存放於仁濟醫院舊屋之議，亦已打銷。再隔了幾天，古物也搬過江來了，在報上也看見說，已决撥　千零五　四箱來上海存放，一部份置於中央銀行銀庫，一部份就是置於仁濟醫院舊址，這些寳貝的安身之處，總算有了着落。昨天我到滬南去，走過天主堂街，在那一埭籬笆邊走時，看見仁濟大厦的牆脚四周，敲着丈許長的木椿，圍繞着密密的鐵絲綱，我默默的理會得，嗄—今天首批故宮古物的一部份要在這裏存放啊。在暮色蒼茫時，我回到滬北去，原從原路經過，穿越了法大馬路，有幾個越捕，椿着指揮棒，禁止閒人和别的車輛通過，上幾輛巨大的卡車，每輛載着—來箱似香烟箱一様的板箱，我因爲突然在不經意中遭到阻止，糊裏糊塗好像一家香烟公司的堆機在存放裝箱的香烟，眞的，眞的，當　我是這般感覺，一霎眼，看見每隻箱上貼着封條，故宮古物·····我突的淸醒了，嗄　故宮古物—我默默的走過了，但，這時我的感覺像不由自主的起了一陣波動，踏在地上的兩肢感到一陣酸麻，眼眶中隠隠的似乎有些潮濕，跨上二路公共汽車，不禁嗤的一笑，是昨年的冬至吧，我和我的媽到别人的鄕基上去搬我的爸的棺木到自己的土地上去，在走近了我的爸的棺木的時候，眞是像這次一様的，我的眼眶中不由自主的潮濕起來。不過，這裏這様的說法，或許别人會覺擬於不倫，實在我自己也想不出别的說法來。當時在車上碰着同居的阿忠，他問我，你的眼鏡片上怎麽會有水的？我不遲疑的說，今天風很大啊！</p>
<h3>收到攝影機裏去</h3>
<p>— 柯定龍</p>
<p>—一張張地冲晒出來—</p>
<p>蓬蓬鬆鬆的　頭曾經人工　熨過的燥髮，——　過的頭髮，根根鬆開，好似很枯燥似的。——蓋住了一張額骨高聳的白臉，——不是生來的白，日用水粉，香粉，雪花·····改造過了的白。——二條用煤　炭畫成的蛾眉，一直通到耳際，不過伊眞的眉梢，未曾去淨，依然有淡靑色存留，近看，好似在二眼上的兩頭蛇呢！凹鼻樑下面橫着一張二英寸闊的厚嘴，塗得血一般紅。再沿下去，就是擁着兩頰的黑毛了，——就是大衣上的皮領。——再下去，露出的長旗袍。單單地祗有二層，一雙六寸圓膚套上尖跟絲襪，穿上高底皮鞋，這是現代人所讚美的新女性的典型—</p>
<p>一身藍布小衫褲工人模様的年靑人，站在人頭擁擠的處所，手裏拏着一支不知從那裏來的劣質自來水筆。賊頭鬼腦偷偷摸摸吔向行人輕輕的說：</p>
<p>「喂！派克自來水筆要嗎；」</p>
<p>會上當的朋友，去和他論交，好好地銀圓給他騙去，拏着一支没用的自來水筆回來，懊悔不迭。有時那般人還會和「廢貨換」的人串同一起，一路走，一路講價。會上當的人們，更容易入穀。</p>
<p>你假如碰到這般人，最好不要理會他們，管自走過。</p>
<p>頭等車，後面的一節三等電車，在早上九時起；下午五時後，總是「生意興隆。」當然是男女雜載，老少俱全。假如在×站上來了一個少女或少婦，裏面坐着的一位洋裝靑年，不問伊是康健的或是　弱的，總霍的立起來讓給伊坐。伊呢，却好似是應當的，理也不理的坐着。同時那讓坐者，却還頻頻俯首注視着伊。有時同車者向他加以注視時，那麽他那副窘態，直是難以難描了。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第一回</p>
<p>推食殷勤邀貧女憶</p>
<p>入門慷慨别具武夫雄</p>
<p>老姑娘這才没有什麽話說，坐到這邊坑頭上來包餃子。江氏坐在坑底下一張破椅上，側了身子向坑上包餃子。因爲許多日子没有吃過包餃子，今天久别重逢，包餃子起來，非常的谪興，一頓工夫，把一疊餃子皮都包放了。抬頭一看時，只見老姑娘一隻腿盤着，一隻腿登立着，那兩隻手，向膝蓋上一抱，緊緊的摟着，昻了頭，只管望了棚頂。江氏將挑肉饀的筷子，在缽子沿上，連連的敲着道：嚇嚇嚇！你又在想什麽？老姑娘被擊缽聲催醒，不由得笑了，便放下那隻腿來，跟了母親包餃子。伊手上雖是在包餃子，心裏可就想着，甘二爺爲人，他是實在的好，不但眼睛裏頭不分什麽貧富，而且不聲不響的，做起事來，總猜到人家心眼裏去。這様的人，無論作街坊，作親戚或者作·····想到這裏，猛然的又聽到幾下擊缽聲。低頭一看，江氏正了臉色，向伊望着道：老姑娘，你這是怎麽了？你今天有點發了瘋病吧？怎麽再三的說不信，你總是這個様子發榜吧？老姑娘笑道：你也管的忒厲害一點，難道想心事也不許我想嗎？說畢撅了嘴，包起餃子來。江氏道：也並不是我不許你想心事，不過我看你，就是這様顚顚倒倒的，有人看到的話，這麽様大丫頭，那可是一椿笑話。老姑娘道：這也没有什麽可笑的呀。伊嘴裏雖然如此說着，可是伊的態度，經了母親這一番警戒，却軟化得多，不聲不響的，也就跟着包起餃子來了江氏雖是上了幾歲年紀，是個時代落伍的人，可是在靑年的時候，伊是個旗族中的大家閨秀，看了老姑娘這様的神氣還有什麽不明白的。當天也不再說什麽，暗暗的却加上了一層心事，對於老姑娘的行動，不免在愛護之外，再加上一層監視。不過他們這個旗族，多少還襲用那舊日的習尙，對於姑娘格外的尊重，也就相當的放任上街，逛廟，買東西，會實客，都讓着大姑娘上前。（六）</p>
<h3>宮</h3>
<p>— 張寗一</p>
<p>—脫不了女性—</p>
<p>宮字終究二様·一說起它，内們腦中就會映現着一座富麗堂皇的建築物，然而它到底是命好，假使讓星相家看起來一定說它是交　部長生運？從　老先生創造迄今，它一直是走着鴻運，這不是在下胡說亂道，倒也有事可證它因着是生來富貴命？所以自誕生後，就和所謂萬人之尊，上天之子的皇帝伯伯發生了密切關係，凡是皇伯伯起居</p>
<p>處無往而不是宮，什麽正宮，寢宮，行宮，不過有一宮是大煞風景，這就是冷宮，皇帝的Ｗife，不，就是皇后，不滿於皇伯伯，就會被貶入冷宮。</p>
<p>這裏我又聯想起了宮字也是艷福不淺，它那裏總脫不了女人，尤其是碰到了風流天子，那麽後宮粉黛，何止數千，外加了宮娥，女樂，脂香粉氣、旖旎風光，眞夠它消受？但是它到底好或壞可又言人人殊，久住在宮裏的女子們說：那裏寂寞冷靜得像墳墓一般，身子又受着一切的束縳，可是外面的人始終到它是懷着神秘的理想，和欣羨之心！</p>
<p>現在拉了一大堆話，說的只是十七八世紀以前的話，在這個年頭兒，在下也許要被人們認爲是鄕下老在講古典哩？但不，朋友，在這二十世紀裏它也未見得落伍，造房子，什麽立體之外，這宮殿式是被認爲藝術化者，還有女學生住的宿舍，好好的是新式建築物，却被人們稱爲東宮，西宮，而一般男同學對這二宮也懷着神秘的思想，所以宮字終究是富貴，而尤其脫不了女子！</p>

<h3>戎裝入錦州（下）</h3>
<p>— 王天恨</p>
<p>他見伊悲思漸殺，和阿妹或是母親談話時漸有了笑容，他心裏更欣喜。是到這時候，他又感覺一種空虚的悵惘，並且有一種恐怖：他防着伊要歸錦州故里·極迫在地想趁此中止朋友和同學的名分。於是在　個傍晚，鼓勇向他求婚，那是已在伊寄居他家的第七天了。</p>
<p>然而他又没有開口便求婚的勇氣。他坐在距伊所坐的臥床有二尺遠的椅子上，聲音不高也並不低的說：</p>
<p>「瓊華！你眞不幸！千里迢地奉母到上海避難，不想伯母又病故了，勝下你一個人，如何能回得故里呢？！我想··你只一個人，可不必回去了！」他還是試探，一顆心在劇烈地跳。</p>
<p>「怎麽不回去？」伊很泰然：「這番到上海來，全是爲了母親！我，誰想避難呢！這個難，不是尋常的難，可以避過去的；正要我們人民去排除這個難。我全是爲了母親，年紀衰邁，不得不從權遷避，不料伊老人家終於死在異鄕！我自己實不想避，也不忍避：假使全國人民都這様遇難即避，這個難便要和江河潰决一般的隨着避難人的脚跟，緊緊不捨，敎他没個避處，那還不是亡了國，到處都是難，避無可避麽？」</p>
<p>他愕然！半晌没有話。心裏盤算：照伊這麽說，也許就要離上海，如何能再慢呢！於是，他鼓足了勇氣，並且將身子移坐床上，和伊並肩，聲音顫動着說　　「瓊華！這說得是！但我有一句久藴</p>
<p>於心的話，不得不向你說：我要求你允許我做我的終身伴侶——說到這裏聲音更顫得厲害，不能繼續說下去；順手拉起伊的一隻手臂，微俯着身子吻着。</p>
<p>瓊華不即答，又在凝神，好久纔說：　　「勝治！你的心我早知道了，我怎麽不允你！我在决定寄居這裏的時候，便已等於允了你。但是，我有一個簡單的條件，我們必須到錦州結婚去！——」</p>
<p>他更愕然！仰起面來看伊的面。</p>
<p>「必須到錦州去！並且要你戎裝入錦州！」—伊的神色依然自若，繼續說：　　「倒不一定要你佩指揮刀做軍官。就是一個小兵也可以，但必須戎裝入錦州；我當先回我的故里，以便在城邊迎迓你，也不一定限在今年明年，就是隔五年十年也無妨，我總在錦州故里期待你。别的，我是什麽希望也没有。」</p>
<p>他已明瞭了伊的意思，也凝思一會，奮然地立起身來說：</p>
<p>「好！　一定依你這個條件！」</p>

<h3>産銷合作之成功</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>祝中華國貨介紹總所開幕</p>
<p>國貨年中最益得欣幸的兩件事；一件是中國國貨公司的成立，一件是明日中華國貨介紹所之開幕，這二件工作，都從中華國貨産銷合作協會所産生，同爲解决民生問題的基本工作，努力物質建設的唯一途徑防止國際入超樹立生産國防的無上利器。産銷合作協會，負此重大使命，一面盡推銷國貨工廠出品及改良宣傳的責任，一面負介紹各地出産及工業原料於國同内外市塲的天職。更爲促進其效能功用深入内地計，因有各地國貨介紹所之設，而以上海總所集其成。其最大任務，以各地貨物，互相介紹於國内外市塲，報告消費情形，陳列國貨様品，接受批發定貨，俾國人能認識國貨的優點，辦别選購的標準，務使生産者無待沾之苦，販賣者省選求之煩。是所宣言：有「從事研究「質」的改良，「量」的增進，「價格」的均衡，「市塲」的情况，期與産銷雙方發生指臂相聯的關係，而收分工合作的功效。好極了，有這様的精神，來爲國貨界服務，可說産銷合作的成功。深望該所實踐宣言，切實做去，不說空話，不作大言，不發空頭支票，不顧私人利益，一年以後，發生極大的效能，可以預卜。</p>
<h3>國貨年中之芝博展覧會</h3>
<p>— 王維騆</p>
<p>中國國貨公司繼起努力</p>
<p>此次參加芝加哥博覧會徴品展覧會在滬公開展覧，各項陳列品，可稱美備。具見徴品人不憚遠道跋涉，廣徴博採至爲可佩。而出品者出其心血結晶，以供發揚國光之需，熱心更不可没。在茲災禍頻仍民不安業之國勢下，得此成績。殊非易易，出國與會、實未始不足與外人爭一日之短長，而顯示我國近年來工藝之進步。惟最近行政院以國難日急，全民族應集中經濟力量，一致抗敵，此在政府方面，固有不得已之苦衷，惟出品人及籌辦人耗費多量金錢時間，方得如許精良出品，一旦停止參加，自覺可惜。現出品人以私人名義，成立出品協會，自動赴美參加，竊以爲此種補救辦法，亦爲我民族之良好精神。且即使不能出國，其參加徴品展覧之一番心血，亦不得虚擲，蓋目下全國上下，正在一致提倡國貨，以求危亡，事實上本極需要一集中精美國貨公開展覧之機會，蓋提倡國貨，首須全國民衆，能深切認識國貨之優點與特徴，藉以打消一般人輕視國貨之劣根性，而使能辨别，何者爲國貨，何者非國貨，或何種洋貨已有國貨代替品，庶不致受奸商之蒙蔽。故記者希望曾參觀徴品展覧會之同胞，能將參觀時所見各種精美國貨之形象，（如飾物綢織陶漆美術等等）永永深印於腦海間，則展覧會之設爲不虚矣。猶有進者，提倡國貨，不特宜行之於國内，尤須推行於國外，方爲富國裕民之道。我國地大物博，昔年各種農産品，出口甚多，漸因農民不知改良，且少數商人，目光短淺，以劣品參雜出售，於是國際市塲，遂失信用。歷年入超驟增，言之可痛。政府有鑒於此，各地設立商品檢騐局，以取締劣貨，設立國際貿易局。以促進海外貿易，民衆先進及有爲商人，現已紛紛組織國貨公司，推銷國産，抵制劣貨，於國於民，利莫大焉。頃中國國貨公司發表宣言，略謂『我國籌備參加芝加哥。博覧會，閱時半年，方克集茲大觀，不謂遭遇國難，遂致奉令結束，殊深惋惜。本公司旣負推銷國貨之使命，自有宣揚國貨之義務，爰本此旨，特關地位，專供各參加出品人移置陳列展覧之用。又此次參加物品均爲國貨精華，凡經參觀者，多有欲購不得，因轉向本公司探詢定購者，日必數起，各出品人如願出售，本公司並願代爲推銷，勉盡棉薄云云。』中國國貨公司爲上海唯一之國貨公司，能繼起努力，眞國貨界之福音，深願各出品人速與合作，以饜滬人士之渴望也。</p>
<h3>國貨界應有之觀摩工作</h3>
<p>— 潘仰葊</p>
<p>最近中國國貨界的進展，的確是不可否認的事實，可是環顧世界各國工業的進步，我們實在又不能自慚的相形見絀了。那未，今後我們還是故步自封的我行我素呢？還是下一番工夫去觀摩他人的進步用作改進的參考呢？這已成了目前的一大問題。</p>
<p>們旣然不能自滿於現實，又不能否認他人的進步，爲着要在這競爭日烈的國際生産界求出路，自然應下一番觀摩研究的工夫。在現在一日千里的生産界，有不進則退的趨勢，我國貨生産界當然要力除那夜郎自大的態度。</p>
<p>幾年來蘇俄工業的突進，五年計劃的收穫，已警醒了一般先進的國家，據報紙刊載，最近重工業的推廣，更有偉大的統計。蘇俄從産業落後的國家而能出人頭地，對於我們滯留在殘破的農村經濟組織時代，實在有足以借鏡的地方。所以，我們中國生産界，可以不必注意政體上的相異，實有向蘇俄工業界去觀摩的必要，從人家發展的途徑上，所究實業成功的所在。最近政府有會同商界金融界組織，蘇俄考察團，這事極有價値，希望國貨界踴躍參加，早早成爲事實。</p>
<p>美國芝加哥博覧會，搜集各國生産品，關於技巧品質各方面，是一個縮寫世界生産趨勢的模型，也是相互比較的機會。如果我國參加，將自己的貨比較旁人的，固然可以明白自己的短長；即是我國不參加的話，我們也可以在人家的出産品中明白人家的長處。</p>
<p>據說赴美參加芝加博覧會，每人需欵美金七百元，如果我們能不虚此行，這些數目却也不算浪費。至於赴俄考察，用費還可節省，都是覺得很値得的。</p>
<p>自然，我們不是極端的崇拜外人；别人的出品自然也有短處，我們的東西也有長處，可是取人之長，去人之短，集各國之珍美於一處，如能切磋推敲努力改進，我們國貨生産界自然會有狠大的發展，也正可以完成國貨年我們生産界改進的重任！</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>店主的修養</h3>
<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>提倡國貨，振興國貨，這并非是虚空的口號可做得到的，須要實地去工作製造，宣傳推銷，方纔能有成功，宣傳推銷，爲老闆者當要努力地去幹，要幹就當具有推銷的知識和技能，如若没有的話，就宜準備起來，修養起來：</p>
<p>一、誰是吾們的主顧！只要是人，不論他是貧富，是貴賤，都是我們的主顧；當主顧走進了店門，就須竭誠地招待，不要因爲他衣服華貴而過分奉承，不要因爲他衣服樸實而橫加鄙視。不論他的進來是有意是無意，你須利用你一己的機巧，去克服顧客游移不定的主張，引誘顧客躍躍欲試的心理，假如他是實在無心購買，也不可稍存冷淡態度，仍宜和平地送客，須知道冷淡是忿恨的表示，忿恨給與人的是羞辱，羞而一怒，交易敗矣；反之，則這一次雖未交易貨物，而他的腦膜上一定可被你印上一條很深的痕跡，想到貨物，就現出了你這様的一個人物，於是他也就成了你的主顧，而且是永久的主顧。</p>
<p>二、個人及店面的裝飾—這是很重要的一個問題，誰喜歡到一所黑暗的齷齪的，凌亂的商店内買東西去？再有誰願意和一個領口墨黑，外衣歪縐，滿口酸臭的人來多談呢？所以爲老闆的應當注意到，窗櫉裏的佈置井然，櫃檯上的一塵不染，而自己呢也需要雪白的領頭，光亮的鞋子，潔凈的牙齒，整齊的外衣，以適合顧客一種舒服的心理。</p>
<p>三、對於商品的認識—做老闆者對於商品的認識是不可馬虎的，好在書本上，報章上，經騐上，在在都可以供給你的知識，漸漸地自可認識牠，譬如有同一用處的兩種物，你可以把自己比人家好的優點細細開明給顧客知道，例如日貨之减料者，必不耐久，國貨則堅固耐用等。再者，如貨物稍有破壞之處，你當解釋出破壞的原因，不要使顧客以爲你的貨物是有缺點的。</p>
<p>四、觀察主顧的心理—主顧中品性不一，事業不一，有閒暇者，有忙碌者，在他們一進來，你當立刻看出他是屬於何等之類：忙碌的人，時間極爲寳貴，你當給與他以誠實的服務，力求迅速，而增强你的効能；閒暇的人，你不妨同他攀談起來，指導他參觀你的貨物，給他簡括的說明，詳細的解釋，務必使他滿意購買而後已，</p>
<p>五、友誼的維繫—來購買東西時算是你的主顧，但是你可不能希望到，與</p>
<p>你的主顧訂上不准别家去交易的契約；但是你可努力你的友誼，無形中把他拉牢，成爲你永久的主顧；利用你的交際手腕，非但可拉牢一個主顧，而且可吸引另外的主顧，所以對於密切的主顧間，友誼的維繫，也是振興你營業的一條出路。</p>
<p>讀書與研究—智識是求之不盡的，爲了業務的發展，你要在你的餘暇，努力於學問的搜求，多閱報章雜誌，研究出應用的技巧，以應付你營業上的需要。</p>
<p>伻厚於此而薄於耶彼</p>
<p>國貨新訊</p>
<h3>婦女對於國貨年的責任</h3>
<p>— 葛成慧博士</p>
<p>在書益社幼稚園裏，坐着矮凳，和許多太太們一齊開家庭改進會，似乎是普通人家的宴會，又好像我們小時候的游戲；不過葛成慧女博士演說時，雖然有些詼諧，大家却很注意的聽，有時會閧堂大笑的代</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>替一般會議中的拍手。這籌所記的，并不是萬博士的全文，祗是一部分和我們國貨週刊有關係的，這也是應該聲明的。（洽記）</p>
<p>我們婦女界要如何救國？在這國難嚴重的年頭兒，大部分的女同胞不能上前線，又不能到後方醫院去當看護，在</p>
<p>這什麽什麽救國的呼聲中，我看還是從服用國貨做起，比較的容易，因爲買東西都是主婦的責任。（有一部分買鞋子還得要男人去買的自然除外。）而且國貨比較便宜，能用國貨的最好用國貨，小人年年紅，年年綠，大人年年黑，年年藍，并没有什麽不便當的處所。</p>
<p>關於服用國貨方面，我們可以分三個步驟。第一：自己用：第二：家庭用，這因爲家庭的東西多是由女人去買：女人用國貨，是有實際權力的。第三：對於友朋監督。第一項第二項只要自己有决心，而第三項則是用榮譽的方法，相互間的監督，譬如人送我的禮品，并不是國貨的時候，我可以謝絶不收，遇到宴會的時候，看見人服用有國貨代用品，便不客氣的說他。以上的方法，我自己曾經嘗試過，成績都還很好，所以特地介紹給各位！（下略）</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>最不歡喜國貨的是什麽人</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>▲難道是學生嗎？</p>
<p>諸位，社會上最不歡喜國貨的是什麽人？大家一定說是摩登女子。啊呀！寃哉枉也，事實勝於雄辯。據一位服務中國國貨公司的朋友告訴吾說：他一天到晚留心顧客的類别，後來得到一個驚人的統計，最多的例是女太太和小姐們，要佔到十分之四五。其次是服務於工商界的人士，也有十分之二三，就是時髦的女子，也不在少數，而最少的，要算學校裏的學生，什麽大學生，中學生，小學生，一切男女學生，不知往那裏去了。他想或者星期日休假期中，可以多幾個學生主顧了。那知依舊寥寥統計的結果，依然大失所望。啊呀！號稱智識階級的學生，自命領導一切的學生，可憐可歎的學生，原來他們是不歡喜國貨的麽？唉，莫名其妙，眞正使人懷疑到極步。問問學校的舍監先生，在請假簿上多是說出外購物，購的什麽？恐怕是王曉籟先生說的東西。（東洋貨西洋貨）不是國貨了。靑年學生如此，其他尙復何望？吾不是來挖苦學生，吾國爲希望學生最殷切，最熱烈，所以纔敢提出這句話來。希敎學生的敎師，以及一般東講演西訓話的先生，費你們五分十分鐘的時間，對於這般不甚信仰國貨的學生們，快來打幾針嗎啡針，吃幾口强心劑，忠告學生們趕快醒轉來，今後不要唱高調說大話，還是先從樂用國貨方面下手先自立一個誓約：</p>
<p>『從今以後，衣食住的所需，非國貨不買。』不但自律，還勸家人，不但勸自家人，還要勸許多人，和不歡喜國貨的人，立刻斷絶往來，這様，纔配稱學生，纔算是中國人。</p>
<p>學生們，再隔幾天，我再要去問問這位服務中國國貨公司的朋友，看他的統計結果，究是最不歡喜國貨的到底是什麽人？</p>
<p>國貨講演</p>
<h3>兩位主辦國貨介紹所的話</h3>
<p>— 薛光前</p>
<p>晚近以來，國貨運動，風起雲湧，然欲使國貨之普遍暢銷，必先須供求相應，貿遷適合，欲盡人樂用國貨，必先須消費者認識國貨出品之優點，與選擇購求之便利，故各地國貨介紹所之設，實爲當務之急，靑島李祖模君，汕頭石夢鶴君，有鑒於此，在當地各籌設國貨介紹所，前在中華國貨産銷合作協會！追叙其籌設之趣旨，甚爲詳賅，記之於此，所以助後起者之參考焉。</p>
<p>（李祖模君）去年十月間，自靑島來滬，適中國化學工業社方液仙君談及組織國貨介紹所事，深覺國步艱難若是，推銷國貨，不論他否營利，實爲國民分内之事，歸與當地人士接洽，極荷贊同，於是着手進行，積極備，迄至今日，資本已集，地址亦定，特派本人南來接洽，惟本人素向服務交通界，對於商界情形，頗多隔閡，還望指敎。</p>
<p>於此，請述靑島國貨介紹所之組織内容及營業方針，定名爲山東國貨股份有限公司，因將來擬在山東境内各重要商埠如濟南烟台等處，遍設分公司，取其範圍可包括山東全省，故名總公司現覓定靑島山東路交通銀行三樓全部爲地址，建築高敞，地方寛大，除開設公司之外尙可容納其他國貨團體，資本十萬元，各商店股份占三分之二，蓋一以利用其爲推銷之分支綫，一所以適應我産銷合作之精神也。</p>
<p>營業分二部·（一）定貨，（二）批發，定貨依照各廠賣出物，不取佣金，批發係先購進現貨，以備各小商店之選購，至運輸方面，因公司中有一股東，營運輸業，故運費可打特别折扣，同時本人在交通界中，每月約有十艘煤船到滬，一向於卸貨後，空船回靑，將來可利用以之裝貨，靑島商家，開銷旣省，而運輸又能得種種便宜，自信不無成功之望。</p>
<p>靑島爲華北商業薈萃之區，經德日兩國經營後、交還我國，交通建設，不僅在華北堪稱獨步，即在中國亦可首屈一指，且以外交關係可不受軍事影響，故商務蒸蒸日上，人口與時俱增，據官廳報告，民國十四年時，人口祗有十九萬，去年增至七十萬，海關收入，於民國十四年時，占第九位，而今除上海廣州二處之外，第三位即屬靑島，以此而測十年以後之靑島，誠不難與上海並駕齊驅，兄弟語此，所以望引起諸位注意靑島爲國貨發展最有希望的地步，而全力赴之，國貨前途，實利賴之。</p>
<p>▲石夢鶴君　此行係爲國貨而來，因兄弟鑒於汕頭地方，商務日盛，全省公路，且已開始建築，惟外貨進口，有增無已，而國貨銷塲，反見日蹙，利權外溢，不可數計，考國貨之滯銷原因，蓋中國人在汕頭從未注意國貨，而外人則無時無刻，不在用腦用力，以有組織之方式，作推銷之計劃，現更加緊努务，以備將來全省公路築成後，長驅直入，深入内地，所以假使現在不再注意，恐將永無注意之機會，此來敢請一般國貨製造家帮忙，予以助力，使在汕頭鼓吹國貨成功，將一般人購用外貨的資金·改買國貨，是則補塞漏巵，挽回利權，豈可以道里計哉，至汕頭何種貨可銷，何種貨不可銷，完全不成問題，因汕頭人民購買力尙不弱，任何貨物，均可銷售，兄弟在汕所營的泰山百貨公司，生意很好，故對於此點可請毌慮，望推誠與汕頭携手國貨，暢銷一時。</p>
<p>新工業介紹</p>
<h3>久大精鹽公司製碱之經過</h3>
<p>碱爲化學工業基本原料之一，國内需要，向唯外貨是賴，自久大精鹽公司發明製碱以後，非但足以自供自給，並能競銷於國外市場，挽回利權，不可數計。范旭東君爲久大精鹽公司之經理，日前來滬調查，對於提倡國貨，主張應有組織。下爲關於久大製碱經過之談話，（光前記）鄙人所辦的工業，是鹽和碱。鄙人所學的，雖是關於化學方面，但起初本不預備辦這種事業，後來在北方看到各地積鹽，多至幾百萬擔，以當地供過於求，賣不出去，以致製鹽者，感到非常痛苦，小工業生活，竟變成奴隷一様。鹽入於鹽商之手，也無法脫售，生活甚爲艱難。那時我將成本計算一下，覺得無論如何，終比買價要低？所以在民國十年，就呈請政府，試做一百擔。不料以政府法令，鹽商制度，鹽梟猖獗等種種關係，事實適得其反，成本超於市價之上。後經種種奮鬥，才能解除一部份痛苦，但迄今尙無澈底解决方法，逐後就想爲中國鹽開一新生路，使其成爲工業用品，以盡其利。至於化學工業原料，爲酸，一爲碱：在民國十五年，就想法將鹽製成碱，這個方法，世界上已有七十多年歷史，且有專利權，所以要自己製造，第一件困難的事情，就是有了錢買不到機器，以致延到民國十六年，才達到目的。起初所有出産，祗足夠自己應用，現在工作日夜不息，每天能産二十萬擔：廠中並無外國技師，但一面隨時派人赴外國考查學習。三年前，各位都知道這是世界托拉司稱成時期，現在居然能被中國制勝却是一件可喜可欣的事情。刻下中國化學製造品，非但能夠運到外國去，並且還能銷到日本安南及南洋各地，這可證明中國人並非没有發明的能力，乃没有奮鬥的决心，以致事事落後！照現在中國的情狀看起來，非絶對工業化不可：這當然不是說全國都要設立工廠·我的意思以爲現在中國還是小農經濟時代，欲和世界機械來競爭，自然要感到痛苦，但是近來政治不安定，民不聊生，都由於小農抵不過機械的結果。而同時我們要生存的，我們要整個的發展，所以個人主張辦工業的人，應該有一個組織，譬如商人有商會一棧，因爲工業界没有一個團體，所以組織毫無，力量四散。其關於交通，原料，治安等等也很要緊，可算是辦工業之生死存亡的問題：同時對於小工業方面，更要加以相當的輔助，因小工業漸漸發達，大工業才有辦法，中國才能工業化！</p>
<p>編餘</p>
<p>大學生與銀行行員　老友金君特告編者謂公提倡國貨，不遣餘力，不過儘你十分努力，恐怕徒勞無功，因爲社會上號稱知識最高領導羣衆的，在學界要推大學生，在商界要推銀行行員，可是這兩種人，推銷外貨最力。穿西裝，吃大菜，吸外國香烟，用外國文具，買外國化妝品，一來顯出他們的時髦，一來表示他們的闊綽，他們生成一副樂用外貨的賤骨頭，好像和國貨犯了仇讐似的，不肯服用國貨。說起這種人眞是可恨可殺，請問你怎様轉移他們這種惡習慣，感化他們，使他們回心轉意來樂用國貨。這一席話，說得我目定口呆，後來我說，這是誰的責任？一般敎育界的先進，銀行業的領袖，請你們且慢唱高調，說遠話，什麽救國，什麽救國，都是空的，把你自己訓導下的學生，把你自己管理下的行員，先來嚴格的訓練一下，矯正一下，一雪這種專喜洋貨的恥辱。你們纔配談救國工作。否則你們自己的人，而還不能管好敎好，還是吃你們的太平飯，免開尊口罷。</p>
<p>深入民間的國貨展覧　提倡國貨，展覧國貨，在上海方面，總算用了不少工夫了，可是内地各縣各鎭還是没有知道國貨的美備，依然爲洋貨銷行的所在。所以目前工作，非把國貨推行内地，深入民間不可。深入民間的最好方法，莫如各工廠赴各地分别舉行國貨展覧會，喚起各地愛國士女服用國貨的决心。現在有一個好消息，聽說各地民衆敎育館，紛紛和中華職業敎育社的中華國貨指導所聯絡起來，在各地舉行國貨展覧會，該所並已聯合上海著名的純粹國貨工廠，共同參加，這種根本救國的工作，是很有價値，很有效力，希望各工廠踴躍參加，各地民衆敎育館積極倣效，在這國貨年中，開一個空前的紀錄。</p>
<p>往那裏去　一羣學生，出了校門，你們可以留心他們往那裏去？往國貨公司去麽？往書店去麽？往圖書館去麽？唉，不是不是，即使去的可憐十不得一。電影院跳舞塲，公園，娛樂塲，纔爲他們光顧，纔有他們足跡，探求知識的書館，販賣眞正國貨的國貨公司，他們似乎不値得進去的。唉說起來實在可憐，敎育破産，敎育破産。</p>
<p>試種黃蜀葵　南匯南門大街方椿庭君，來函謂鄕間的黃蜀葵，爲造紙廠的重要資料，年來試種以後利益很大，一方希望大家試種，一方希望上海造紙廠的提倡。這也農村的副業，吾想國貨造紙廠中，如江南，龍章，天章，竟成等廠，一定有很好的指導，來答復方君。</p>
<h3>在國貨年裏</h3>
<p>— 祝明珍女士</p>
<p>獻給全中國的女同胞們</p>
<p>全中華民國的女同胞們！你們可知道吾國每年要被仇人吸收去多少金和銀？</p>
<p>倘若要收回這許多金銀，祗有我們婦女來提倡國貨爲一條最妙的路徑。</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>全中華民國的女同胞們！你們快乘今年的「國貨年」裏，團結起來一致的去提倡國貨！那未吾國的金和銀永不會再被仇人吸收去了，</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>全中華民國的女同胞們！你們應當在國貨年裏　趕緊起來與男子們去爭勝！</p>
<p>可是這個機會我們切不能放棄才行，</p>
<p>也可以現出我們婦女有愛國的精神！</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>全中華民國的女同胞們！你們拿國貨去製一襲一服裝　穿在身上何等光芒！</p>
<p>還可博得人家呌你一聲「愛國小姐」！</p>
<p>那時候你聽了多麽快爽？</p>
<p>參觀記載</p>
<h3>參觀芝博徴展會之後</h3>
<p>— 禾口</p>
<p>這次在滬上舉行的芝加哥博覧會徴展會在我國可算從西湖博覧會之後惟的盛舉了，會内所陳列的物品，都是各地的特産，所以大足以廣我們的見識；而且這許多陳列品都要寄往美國給世界各國人去看的，我覺得更有去參觀的價値。</p>
<p>在會塲裏所看見的是，美麗精緻的江西瓷器，五彩悅目的福建漆器，質地優良的杭州絲綢，各種各様的紅茶綠茶，維妙維肖的雕刻模型，以及湘繡書畫等，眞是美不勝收，的確我們的國産貨，眞不錯，外國人恐有自愧不如之歎。</p>
<p>不過我覺得對於新工業及工程方面太不景氣了，新工業只有幾種食品及搪瓷等，工程方面，除了幾所建築模型，及交通大學所出二只電機以外，簡直是很少很少，這可奇了，豈是爲着我們國産新工業品的不好，不便給大衆展覧麽？這未免太荒謬了，雖然我國科學幼稚，工業落伍，出品不及歐美各國來得佳妙，但是我們也至少，要將我們近十年以來的蹩脚成績，來給人家看看：一來我們可與外國貨比較觀摩；二來也足以表示我們雖然落伍，但仍正在努力地奮鬥，不致被外人想我們只是故步自封，不會進步的，而且，最近湯仲明君所發明的木炭汽車，以及火箭等，更有參加斯會之意義，但是却缺而不與，眞使我莫明其妙！</p>
<p>在我國這種戰爭連年的情形之下，雖然出産品成績不甚好也没十分難會情。我們只要有我們的新成績，就足以表示我們進取的精神，倘若專以幾種舊有的特産品，永遠做着我們的好成績，這或許會被外國人稱爲「炒冷飯」。</p>

<p>紗市依然平靜、形勢極其穩定、但環境仍劣、故新買者、未見増多、市上實銷較昨爲旺、惟大量交易、仍無活動之狀、因金融枯涸、日軍侵略日烈、紗銷大受打擊、至於空頭方面、以底貨太厚、逢漲抛出、</p>

<p>棉棉市略漲、因金價回高、美匯轉縮、致人心帶硬一步、檯面較緊、惟印棉市氣極其平澹、午後又有廉價印棉做開、然市場上毫無影響、一般買方意態安靜、以美棉必有趨漲望、有一部份購進加碼、前途如何、須依美棉開出爲定、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>米市爲阻運成定局</p>
<p>（滬南）船户罷運相持不下、而連日去胃亦懈市價　跌、今城鄕店胃稍佳、然車貨棧貨相機脫售、市情惟形色見旺、價格無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下來源仍由小港來滬二三號、車運績有來源、白粳走化呆滯、致市疲落近尺、薄粳早粳去路不暢、價短一二角、杜尖亦疲角許、羊埠客尖定勢、陰元乏到、白元平定、</p>
<h3>客秈閩化仍活</h3>
<p>昨日客秈閩化仍活、福州帮胃口較旺、泉州帮亦銷問津、本街多數觀望、但到頭减少、湖南米機油機紅以存到兩少、價漲七八分、江西米高貨看好五分、但市上只有上中貨售開、後市如客化再旺、則行情有步砌之必要、統市售開江西機晚一千七百包、價八元六角半至八元四角三分、又機卑一百包、價七元六七角、又機紅五十八包、價八元三角八分、湖南機油五百五十三包、價八元八角至八元半、又機紅一千五百包、價八元四角八分至八元四角、本街辦去江西機晚五百包、湖南機紅四百包、其餘爲閩帮辦去、</p>
<h3>標粉麥大勢平穩</h3>
<p>粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼穩之象以洋麥報價、坎麥回跌三角左右、芝麥無市、故初開時、人心平疲、較前日收價、近期跌下、遠期跌五厘、惟以後各盤、又復盤高、因廣東帮近遠各期、均有胃口、大廠依然　住、故市氣復轉穩態、迨至下午開盤、初開時人心頗佳、因廣帮又有進意、本月份曾到過八錢、旋因阜豐套賣、市面復轉平定、遠期各月份、又呈盤旋、上落無幾、目卜現貨、福新聞甚緊、惟照抽不加、餘尙寛鬆、結果本月份至六月份各較前日好二厘半、七八月份好五厘、</p>
<p>麥市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、因坎麥報　　跌三角、人心大致平平、近期不振、遠期尙穩、迨至下午開盤、三四月份因行家補進、市氣反好、以行家之套貨、一部份已售於廠家、故標準勢須抵進、遠期各月份、因行家仍有套賣市氣平平、結果本月份較前日好一分、四月份好二分、七月份小一分、八月份小二分、</p>
<h3>油漲錢許黃荳平穩</h3>
<p>昨日油市銷胃尙健、貨主緊扳高價、致胃勢减色、計成交荳油四百件、做開盤價好錢半、生油走化稍暢、售開九百件、輕皮油照前市加一錢、夾倉油因貨稀加二錢、廠荳油銷胃不健、市屬平局、黃荳走化近日見滯、市况因貨薄人心尙穩、廠家辦胃亦淡、昨市成交正陽關荳二車、其餘蒙城荳及卜州荳福州辦去二車、郯城荳内地車坊成交一車、靑荳至存兩稀、而去胃厦門溫台甬帮均有問津、故市形頗呈堅穩、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>糖的趨勢仍然下落</p>
<p>昨糖市以標金雖見回升、但銷路仍極淸淡市勢未定、依然下落公會劃盤廿四號粗砂白爲十五兩一錢二分半、比前日小二分半、二十號中砂白以連日抛價、合劃頗廉、昨市劃十四兩四錢、跌度較多、八九號荷赤劃十一兩七錢半、亦跌一錢、成交均少、洋行抛貨有立基售出六七月份荷赤二百噸、價爲荷幣三·七五、大昌售出四月份二十號中砂白一百五十噸、價爲三·九五、（均新規外稅）各行進胃轉稀、建冰無大批交易、原價微有開出、潮靑刁靑皆以市疲號盤停滯、蓋各貨市勢、一時尙無穩定之象、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>花旗五金爲匯價帶小</p>
<p>昨日美匯已至三十五元有奇、致本埠所存之花旗五金行情、爲之帶小、如靑鉛跌二錢、刻衹估十一兩六錢半、花旗方釘跌五錢、售十兩、　白鐵亦跌二三錢不等、其價二十四號估十五兩七錢、二十六號十八兩、二十八號十七兩、三十一號十五兩、惟交易仍不見若何進展、此外若馬口鐵·會司鐵等、雖尙未波及、但人心被其帶軟不少矣、連日同業探問、美貨定價者陸續不斷、但終無回電答覆、諒係混沌之局勢、更甚於申地也、此外英貨市面、依然平穩、各貨交易北路完全停頓、南路亦屬有限、故市塲之頼以點綴者、衹本街廠家及建築帮耳、</p>
<h3>煤炭</h3>
<p>客帮動辦煤斤</p>

<h3>市場零簡</h3>
<p>美國發生銀潮、致外匯幾失標準、本埠洋莊絲銷、因之無所依據、歐美各莊對於期現絲均不敢冒險進行、華洋雙方均無談判、祇滬綢廠辦進公園牌頂頭號十八至廿　份白廠經十五包、價扯五百十兩、　　英郵船考爾夫號昨出口、怡和三星等行有華絲一百五十四件裝出、計九十七件運花英倫、粗絲五十七件運英轉印度、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>伸寃</h3>
<p>— 干</p>
<p>李頓報吿書採用了中國人自己發明的「國際合作以開發中國的計劃」</p>
<p>這是値得感謝的，—最近南京市各界的電報已經「謹代表京市七十萬民衆敬致感念之忱」</p>
<p>，稱他「不僅爲中國好友，且爲世界和平及人道正義之保障者」。</p>
<p>（三月一日南京中央社電）</p>
<p>然而李頓也應當感謝中國才好；第一，假使中國没有「國际合作學説」，李頓爵士就很難找着適當的措辭來表示他的意思。豈非共營没有了學理上的根據？</p>
<p>第二，李頓爵士自己説的：「南京本可歡迎日本之扶助以拒共産潮流，」他就更應當對於中國當局的這種苦心孤詣表示誠懇的敬意。</p>
<p>但是，李頓爵士最近在巴黎的演説，（路透社二月二十日巴黎電），却提出了兩個問題，一個是：「中國前途，似繋於如何，何時及何人對於如此偉大人力于以國家意議的統一力量，日内瓦乎，莫斯科乎？」還有一個是：「中國現在傾向日内瓦，但若日本堅持其現行政策，而日内瓦失敗，則中國緃非所願，亦將變更其傾向矣。一這兩個問題都有點兒侮辱中國的國家人格。國家者政府也。李頓説中國還没有「國家意識的統一力量」，甚至於還會變更其對於日内瓦之傾向！這豈不是不相信中國國家對於國聯的忠心，對於日本的苦心？</p>
<p>爲着中國國家的尊嚴和民族的光榮起見，我們要想答復李頓爵士已經好多天了，只是没有相當的文件。這使人苦悶得很。今天突然在報紙上發見了一件寳貝，可以拿來答復李大人：這就是「漢口警部三月一日的佈吿。」這裹可以找着「鐵一樣的事實，」來反駁李大人的懷疑。</p>
<p>例如這佈吿（原文見申報三月一日漢口專電）説：「在外資下勞力之勞工，如勞資間有未解决之正當問題，應禀請我主管機關代爲交涉或效濟，絶對不得直接交涉，違者拿辦，或受人利用，故意以此種手段，構成嚴重事態者，處死刑。「這是説外國资本家遇見「勞資間有未解决之正當問題，可以直接任意辦理，而勞方而如此」這般者·····就　處死刑。這樣一來，我們中國就只剩「用國家意識統一了的」勞工了因爲凡是違背這「意識」的，都要請他離開中國的「國家」丨到陰間去。李大人難道還能够説中國當局不，「國家意識的統一力量」嗎？</p>
<p>再則統一這個「統一力量」的，當然是日内瓦，而不是莫斯科。「中國現在傾向日内瓦」丨這是李頓大人自己説的。我們這種傾向十二萬分的堅定，例如那佈吿上也说：「如有奸民流痞受人誘買勾串，或直受驅使，或假托名義，以圖破壞秩序安寗，與構成其他不利於我國家社會之重大犯行者，殺無赦」。這是保障「日内瓦傾向」的堅决手段，所謂「雖流血亦所不辭」。而且「日内瓦」是講世界和平的，因此，中國兩年以來都没有抵抗，因爲抵抗就要破壞和平；直到一二八，中國也不過裝出擋擋炸彈槍砲的姿勢；最近的熱河事變，中國方面也同樣的儘在「縮短陣線」。不但如此，中國方面埋頭勦匪，已經宣吿在一兩個月内肅淸匪共，一暫時」不管熱河。這一切都是要證明「日本······見中國南方共産潮流漸起，很可以無須親自出馬。中國方面這樣辛苦的忍耐的工作着，</p>
<p>爲之焦慮」是不必的日本無非是爲着要感動日本，使牠悔悟，達到遠東永久和平的目的，國際資本可以在這裹分工合作。而李顿爵士還要懷疑中國會「變更其傾向」。這就未免太寃枉了。　　總之，［處死刑，殺無赦」，是回答李頓爵士的懷疑的歷史文件。請放心罷，請扶助罷。</p>
<h3>讀報心得</h3>
<p>— 施蛰存</p>
<p>時局緊張·讀報也格外起勁，格外用心。茲將三日來報上所見幾句警句，爲之詮釋，亦『四書味根』之意也　　㈠三月五日下午三時，立法院長孫科在上海哥倫比亞路私邸，對各報記者説：『熱河天險，守軍達十餘萬，中央雖明知結果必敗，然無論如何，以爲至少當能支持二三個月，聞張漢鄕對人言，亦以二月爲期，在此時期中，足予我國駐日内瓦代表以努力機會，俾國際對於制裁日本，得更有力量之發展，不料戰未及十日······』（見六日申報）</p>
<p>註曰：『這是説中央雖明知熱河是天險，守軍達十餘萬不可謂不是重兵，但這天險與重兵是祇可守二三個月的。二三個月之後，中央是預算着會失敗的。這不僅中央的意見如此，就是張漢鄕的長期抵抗，也是以二月爲期的，那麽，爲什麽中央與張漢鄕要預備抵抗日本至二個月之久呢？這是因爲要日内瓦的我國代表團有一個努力活動的機會。這邊一支持，那邊一努力，於是國際對於日本的制裁，便有更有力量的發展了。於是·那時候，我們也就不防吃敗仗了。而不料·········』</p>
<p>㈡張繼在徐州説：『暴日砲火不足畏，十年内，日本必有大革命。』（見七日大晚報）</p>
<p>註曰：『這是很可以使我們安心的。因爲十年内，日本必有大革命，那時日本帝國主義自然而然的的消滅的。目下雖然吃他們一點砲火，嘸啥希奇，頂多忍耐十年，他們的砲火也不能向我們施放了。此義推而廣之，對於一切侵華的帝國主義者，都可以不足畏了之。因爲在十年内，全世界的帝國主義者都必然會得崩潰的。何必我們去反抗與打倒呢？』</p>
<p>又註曰；『張繼先生此語，可有兩解。張先生之意若曰：「日本砲火不足畏，十年内，日本必有大革命，斯可畏也。」阿彌陀佛，善哉善哉！』</p>
<p>㈢孫殿英電京辦事處云：『·······四日以來，風雪并厲，時而汗流浹背，時而遍體凍僵，無彈猶可肉搏，無食確爲可憫。總之天存中國，必存熱河，天存熱河，必存我軍······』（見七日時報晨刋）</p>
<p>註曰：『風雪并厲，以致遍體凍僵不錯。但時而汗流浹背，何故歟？文疑有衍。無彈猶可肉搏，横堅一樣的是打。無食則奈何？曰可憫，可憫則無食猶有食矣。這且不管，咬文嚼字，大可不必，總之此次抗日，成敗在天。天意若曰救中國，則中國也，熱河也，「我軍」也，可以高枕而無憂，無彈無食，没有關係。否則「我軍」敗北，不必援，因爲　熱河也必然會失。熱河失，也不必退守後防，預備反攻，因爲整個的中國是亡</p>
<p>定了。此抗日邏輯也。但是，現在事實是熱河已經失了，由此觀之，則中國已經亡了，而孫將軍的「我軍」想必也早已不存在了。』</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>在從前，如果有人問我説：「你的家住在什麽地方」？</p>
<p>我可以立刻回答出來：「我的家住在吉林」。</p>
<p>如果再問我家裹有多少人，我也可以淸淸楚楚的説：　　「六個人，父親，母親，嫂嫂，妹妹，姪兒和我」。</p>
<p>但現在，就全不是那麽一回事了。如果現在再有人問我同樣的話，那我回答起來，定要沉思一下的。</p>
<p>「我的家麽」？停一下，讓我來想想　　「我的家，大槪總還在地球上吧，如果我家裹的人還着的話」。接着我再説，「至於家中還有幾個人，這我衹可</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（二十二）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯納　宜閑譯</p>
<p>「喳！」那彫刻家説。「你的上帝是個生手，這他自己也明白，我</p>
<p>我攤頭上帳篷角落有着幾尊希臘神　美麗得連上帝自己也要妒忌起來，當他將這些和他自己不老練的作品比較一下的時候。我吿訴你，上帝如果眞有着什麽手的話，他是因爲他自己的手太粗笨的缘故，纔造了我的這手的。藝術家的神自己是這樣的藝術家，他永不滿意於他的作品，總是儘他能力的限度使也完全，總是意識着：雖然他到那限度時候，必須停止了，可是此外却還有着更進一步的完成，没有這個，那盡像水没有意義的。你的上帝能够造女人的，他可能造愛之女神麽？</p>
<p>不能的罷：只有藝術家纔辦得到啦。你看！」他説，一面站起來，走到攤頭裹邊去，「上帝可能造出他來麽？」於是他從帳篷角落系了一尊白石的梵納斯，便放在櫃檯上。</p>
<p>「他的手脚是冷的」黑女孩子説，他始終用心聽着，誰也没有注意他。　　「你説的好！」亞拉伯人説。「一件活的失敗的作品是比死的桀作好；這纔證明上帝反」</p>
<p>對這個極狂妄的偶像崇拜者是正當的了，要不是你用一句話殺了他，那我一定就一刀殺掉他了。」</p>
<p>「我還活着哩」，那藝術家一點也没有漸愧似的説。「那女孩子的手脚總有一天要比什麽白」</p>
<p>石還冷的。將我的女神做兩段看；她還壓根兒是白石啦。再用你的彎刀將那女孩子切做兩段，看那里會怎樣的罷。」</p>
<p>「你的話，我再也感不到興味了」那亞拉伯人説。「大姑娘；我家裹還可以再住一個妻子啦。你長得好看，你的皮膚好像黑缎子一樣；你是活潑潑的。」</p>
<p>「你有着多少個妻子呢？」黑女孩説。</p>
<p>「我長久没有數了」那亞拉伯人答説；「可是那麽多也够呌你明白我是有經騐的丈夫，知道照上帝所准許那樣，使女人幸福的辦法的。」</p>
<p>以决然的説，有一個我」—我不能再説還有父親母親······的話了，因爲我眞不知道他們五個人現在是否還活在世上！那麽，問題又來了，一個人怎能談到『家』呢？不錯，那麽我還是痛痛快快的説了罷：「我没有家」！</p>
<p>也許我那五個家人都還健在，那，我可眞要感謝上天了，感謝上天照顧他們活着。因爲如果他們還能活着，那實在不能不説是「天助」了。</p>
<p>但這樣的「天助」是不會有的。因爲上天旣未生出看顧窮苦人的眼睛，並且向來對於窮苦人是不肯伸開它的兩隻神手的。何况依據事實推測，他們是决難逃出死亡的災難呢？這原因是，日本帝國主義關東派遣軍，在東三省，在吉林，在我的故鄕金家屯，一個小小的村莊，爲要澈底解决他們的眼中釘，民衆義勇軍起見，所有一九三三年最新式的殺人武器，都在這小村莊上使用過。我的故鄕早已滅亡，我的家，可想而知該有着怎樣的結果了。</p>
<p>從一些故鄕來人的談話中，從一些記載中，我聽到些看到些屯子被炸燬，屯民被慘殺的話語與消息。至於我所期望聽　或是看到的：「炸燬時有難民若干逃出」的話語或消息，却是白白的期望着。這不是一個明證麽，這不是很易推斷出來的麽？</p>
<p>所以，我説，我的家是没有了，一定没有了。但單單是我的一個家，那又何等的渺小，——存亡與否有什麽要緊！不過，同時一想到世界上還有一天羣的人和我一樣遭着家破人亡的亞運，這到是使我非常難過的！</p>
<h3>巴黎的華僑（續）</h3>
<p>— 復生</p>
<p>但巴黎留學生裹面眞用功的也不是没有。我可以大膽的説一句：理科學生是比較用攻的。—這並不是因爲我自己是學理科的，便替理科吹，實在因爲學理科的總要有點實在的東西，無法取巧。其次是文科。文科學生可以分做三種；第一種是和法國學生一起受碩士學位（Ｌicence)試騐的人，這種人是和理科學生一樣，非用功不行的。第二種是鄙視學位，自己就性之所近，埋頭研究一樣東西，不計一切的；這種人當然有他特殊的議見和勇氣，値得我們佩服。第二種是渾渾噩噩，什麽也不懂，目的祇在拿一張學校博士的文憑回來騙人的，這種人最無聊。老實説，現在有許多已在國内做着大學敎授的文學博士，我相信他們是連一封淸通的法文信都不能寫的。我知道有一個比我遲三年到巴黎而比我早兩年回上海的江蘇大少爺，在法國總共没有住到三年，已是哲學博士，並且帶回了一本三英吋厚的，印得精精緻緻的博士論文！這眞不能不説是天才了—聽説這位天才博士現在也在什麽大學做着敎授了。</p>
<p>説了半天，我還没有説到法科。法科學生的情形，大槪也和文科差不多。凡是和法國學生一同受碩士學位試騐的，比較有點東西。（但這只限於巴黎大學的碩士學位。至設在外省的各大學，因爲有一種專給外國人的法科碩士，中國人趨之若逐臭之蠅，其滑稽可笑，與巴黎大學的學校博士一樣。）</p>
<p>除留學生外，現在巴黎還有幾百工人和商人。工人多半是參戰時來的，有的討着法國女人，已不想回國了。可是近年因爲受着世界經濟恐慌的影響，巴黎附近各工廠到處排斥外國工人，有許多華工弄得困苦不堪，其所以還没餓死者，就因爲他們有過人的忍耐。—他們常是比法國人多做一倍的工作，而少得一半的工錢。這些工人裹面，有許多工廠經騐很豐富，技術很熟練的，假如能够呌回國來，在本國工廠裹面擔任指導的工作，我相信一定比那些初出學校的技師好。</p>
<p>説到商人，那眞是可憐！在巴黎，除掉幾家小古玩店和小雑貨店之外，中國人經營的商業，就只有飯店了。所以巴黎華僑裹面的商人，分析起來，就只有古玩店老闆，雑貨店老闆，飯店老闆，還有······還有一些推銷日本貨的靑田商人。關於靑田商人，説來話長，並且他們的活動範圍不限於巴黎，所以我想以後另文叙述，不在這裹里説了。</p>

<h3>德意志政狀之一瞥（柏林通信）</h3>
<p>希脫拉標誌的萬字旗幟、表示他所領導的國家社會黨不屬於資本主義、同時也不屬於共産主義、而是向着第三帝國前進的、他主張、拒絶支付賠欵、主張軍備平等、要求改訂國境、高呌德意志「自力更生」、因此博得多數知識界的靑年、二十幾歲的大學生的同情、</p>
<p>從一九一八年歐洲大戰宣吿停戰當時、十八歲的靑年都有三十二歲了、二十歲以上三十二歲以下有選舉權的靑年男女現有一千三百六十萬人之多、如果再過七八年的話、則未經過戰爭的靑年將有二千一百萬以上、這就要占選舉人的半數、</p>
<p>這些靑年無論他是國社黨員、是共産黨、却都因爲德國打過敗仗、而仍舊受着處罰、所以他們一致憤慨、一致表示反抗、國社黨要學步意大利後塵以武力宣吿「凡爾塞和約」無效、共産黨要建立蘇維埃德意志、則「凡爾塞和約」自必無效、其手段雖各不同、而以實力打開國際現狀則一也、</p>
<p>特别是希脫拉黨的黨員確信他們是德意志民族中的優秀分子、他們要運用其思想力、團結力來打破現狀、來恢复國威、並且更高倡和意大利·匈牙利·奥大利合作、這就更加助長德國人民的氣勢、</p>
<p>中央黨社會民主黨所以衰落的原因、就是他們安於現實、不謳歌舊時帝政、就遷就現實、所以甘心屈服於「凡爾塞和約」鐵鎖之下、因此漸失人心、往右的靑年就跟隨希脫拉跑、往左的靑年就加入共産黨或同情於共産黨、</p>
<p>社會民主黨本來是以産業工人爲中心的組織在大戰之後、牠很占優勢、最盛的時代曾有議席一百八十、但是後來因爲失業者、微溫的社會政策、不能抓着羣衆、所以牠的羣衆、被共産黨漸次蠶食、</p>
<p>中央黨是天主敎徒的團體、其構成分子有資本家也有工人、大體上他們都是順應大勢、并没有積極的指導原則、不過他們贊成威馬爾憲法、主張民主制、共和制、如果時移勢變、都要復辟的話、牠也不至於堅决反對、</p>
<p>以上兩派是今年一月以前在政治占優勢的政黨、所以希脫拉組閣也還不能不拉攏巴本、</p>
<p>德意志國權黨的構成分子是大地主、資本家、地主貴族中的將校出身的貴胄子弟·他們頗有恢復帝制的意圖、但是實力却有限、</p>
<p>希脫拉所領導的國家社會黨、則以自耕農、白頌頭階級、小資本家爲中心、竭力反對民主主義、主張獨裁、而對於帝制的復活、特别是「何恒左勒林」王朝的復位表示曖昧、與資本家也暗中拉手、所以牠聲勢浩大、要支配全德意志、</p>
<p>以上兩黨聯合起來却有推倒社會民主黨、壓服中央黨的可能、雖然中央黨表示與希脫拉合作、但是民主政制、總與牠是不相容的、</p>
<p>此外與他們立於絶對反對地位的是共産黨其成構分子主要的是失業工人和流浪的知識分子、牠雖然努力要打破德國的現狀、究竟得不到絶對多數的支配勢力、但是要完全撲滅牠、恐怕也不可能、</p>
<p>希脫拉誠然高呌着復興德意志、彈壓共産黨、可是五百七十萬以上的失業工人、没有工做、縱今拿回阿爾薩斯洛連、上西蓀</p>
<p>利西亞與夫海外殖民地還是没有法子解决、何况他所持的經濟綱領就是巴本内閣時代的綱領、説要救濟德國、事實上不會有多大效力、不過他如能得到英法兩國金融資本家的諒解、則對内可以運用陸軍和警察打敗共産黨將來更可以征服中央黨、國權黨、對外則接近英法、疏遠蘇聯、對意大利當然會更見密切、三月五日的大選當然是運用政權的黨得勝、可是共産黨也不至消滅、社會民主黨還是牠原來的狀態、（一九三三·二月五日於柏林）</p>

<h3>尼安燈方棚</h3>
<p>— 韓克筠</p>
<p>讀過阿唐君的尼安燈，因之而談到尼安燈的方棚；</p>
<p>要裝置尼安燈，就帶連了要裝置方棚，所以尼安燈與尼安燈方棚是變成了連續品；我將牠的構造和原理，寫在下面；</p>
<p>將粗細的銅絲繞絲成正副兩種綫圈，細綫繞的正線圈普通是稱做髙壓綫圈，Ｈigh　Tension另外粗銅絲繞的副綫圈就最低壓綫圈，Ｌow　tension　髙壓和低壓是分成兩組，置列在前後，中間隔着薄片的小塊磁鐵　Ｂy　Pass　Jamination牠的四週中心推砌橫Ｅ字形色的薄片大塊磁鐵，Ｍain　Jamination大塊磁鐵都是一倒一正的裝置，片數大約是八十餘至九十張，如此製成後，可以常保堅實，磁力亦可均匀，</p>
<p>綫圈和磁鐵相近處都隔着千層紙，紙拍，等絶緣物品，此外綫圈和綫圈每層和每層之間，亦皆塗以有隔電能力的油漆，以及特製的絶緣紙隔好，待至各部完善，然後用倍過規定電壓的高壓電流，試騐絶緣物是否有損，經過試騐仍舊完好，再裝入鐵箱，缺空處灌以絶電膠，Ｔrop絶電及絶空氣，始可售給裝置尼安燈的店號應用</p>
<p>尼安燈方棚的所以要使部部絶緣，以尼安燈所受電力，均爲極高度的電壓，故高壓和低壓，絶對應使絶缘，即磁鐵亦當絶緣因遇有一處絶缘處稍爲薄弱，則皆可與高壓綫圈流通，以一疎失，設有人觸及，則生命有虞，故製尼安燈方棚者，精蜜審愼絶緣，爲秘須條件。</p>
<p>電流在綫内流動時，此時磁鐵即發生磁流磁流走入綫圈，因數量的交變，電磁相感應，於是高壓綫圈就變成了極高電流，這就是尼安燈方棚的原理·</p>
<p>在昔年的尼安燈方棚，皆爲外國購來；近年國内亦有製造，惟僅祇本埠亞光製造公司，及其他二三家而已—</p>
<h3>鎮静到底</h3>
<p>文藝</p>
<h3>叢葬餓殍感賦</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>前接甘肅友人來函，附有和鄧德輿君題臨夏調查叢葬餓殍照片五古一首，已送登去年十一月十七日本刋，頃接鄧君寄來原作，一字一淚，不忍卒讀，補錄如下，如誌哀痛，巖邑屢兵燹，人如鳥獸散，宵征敢吿勞，生命永倖免，力盡伏巖穴，氣急不敢喘，無裳何足羞，婦女脚亦跣，亂平無家歸，屋址何從辨，有田無力耕，况復遭旱暵，官府擲恤勤，受恩已不淺，無奈人太多，汲深綆仍短，行乞遍城鄕，終日難一盌，哀哉刦中人，終致溝壑轉，或則肢已殘，或則頭已斷，或則血尙流，或則髮尙辮辮</p>
<p>，或則咀蜿蜒，潰散不能洗，或則骽曲蜷，撫摩不能展，將欲謀遷徙，肉脫不能撚，果然亂世人，不及平時犬，聚爲一兵貉，聊封三尺墠，麥飯憑誰澆，傷心淚潛潛，</p>
<h3>把戲</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>已是桃花怒放的時候了，氣候還是這樣寒冷。一切新鮮的把戲，也没有人高興地首先發起。燈光下，每個人埋緊着頭，希望自己的工作早的幹完，披上大衣，歸家去安睡。今天天氣還是照樣的寒冷，但是爲了有四五個同事，已從馬上侯買醉回來，所以空氣中，多少激蕩着春的意味。自己在同事中是最年輕的一個，平時偶然説幾句俏皮話外，别的把戲不能發明，也不去與分，今天見他們對於　事工作，微微露着厭倦的意識，無意地對同桌的陳説，「打茶園去？」雖然是輕輕的一句話，似乎像炸彈一樣驚動了一室人的魂靈。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>「滿園春色關不住」，小白臉的老何，微微點着頭，哼出永遠不成腔調的詩句，自然他是含着諷剌的意思，但是知道他平日行爲的同事，當然明白爲了擁護「打茶園去？」的提議而樂意忘形哼出來的。</p>
<p>「小張，有什麽意外的奇蹟嗎？」陳似乎忘却了我時常反對他們的行動，稱我不懂事的小弟弟。</p>
<p>「小弟弟，士别三日，當刮目相看」</p>
<p>！」老何喜歡説人家用熱　　句子，但是説起來老是不成調。</p>
<p>三五句打趣後，像得了什麽暗示，各人埋緊頭幹他們的工作。我以爲一幕趣劇，已經閉幕：事畢後，披上大衣，預備歸老家，卻被陳一手拉住説：獨溜嗎？」</p>
<p>顯然無意的「打茶園去？」他們已認爲事實。</p>
<p>老何也跳起來説：「别瞧他小弟弟，人小心不心！」</p>
<p>我這時懊悔不該首先發起這所新鮮的把戲，現在强辯也無益·小弟弟的罪惡，已莫須有的判决。三個人出了報館，像被押解似的在寒風中向西走去。</p>
<p>「小張，什麽地方？」因爲老是不説話向前走，陳忍不住問了。</p>
<p>「我也不知到那裹去？」</p>
<p>「打茶園啊！」老何忘了這是熱鬧的市區中心，大聲地喊了。</p>
<p>從路旁送來幾聲笑聲，老何不好意思的用手灣　了我一下。　　「老何，眞没有地方，不過你們提議那裹去，小弟弟奉陪好了！」我見事實已成僵局，才折衷辦法的仰求他們。　　「小鬼頭！」老何説後，仍是默默的走路。　　「XX那裹去罷丨」陳提議。　　已没有出來時的高興。ＸＸ從前是辦事室中每天可以聽見的名字，還有每天不同的新聞和ＸＸ兩字連接着。　　没有表示我和老何隨着陳轉了灣。這時候水電燈的包車，來往的交熾，三個行路人的六道目光，對每輛包車，都貪婪地不肯放鬆，或者想從這裹得到今夜的答案。　　「小陳」迎面來的包車上的粲者招呼陳·　　「窮忙啊！出堂唱去？」</p>
<p>包車已交臂向後，我問老何「這是誰？」　　「ＸＸ怒氣的回答」</p>
<p>已失去了最後的希望，寒風吹來覺得刺骨，還是老何懊喪地説：「回家去罷！」</p>
<p>會意似的點點頭·各人跳上路旁的車子。</p>
<p>後面送來「熱河失守！槍斃湯玉麟一」賣晚報的呼聲。</p>
<h3>新春</h3>
<p>— 盛愛耐女士</p>
<p>和煦的春風，陣陣送到我的身邊，拂動我的衣袂，使人微微有些醉意，</p>
<p>小河中的水，淸平和明鏡一般，忽然，一陣春風把淸平的水，起了無數的縐紋，</p>
<p>在碧空中，除了幾團似綿羊般的白雲，和高飛的小鳥以外，是没有絲毫别的物件了。</p>
<p>這幾團白雲，小鳥，他們是脫離了這塵世，在這純潔的太空中倒很逍遥自在。</p>
<p>一羣像小天使般的兒童，着了輕薄的衣衫，個個人的面龐，都現出快樂的笑容，有的在看書，有的在踢　子，有的在造房子，都用她們肥白的小手小脚，活潑地動着，在這春之神降臨，大自然籠罩之下。</p>
<p>三五隻雪白的綿羊，低着頭在吃草，發出細微的咀嚼聲，遠遠望過去，好似一大堆棉花一般。</p>
<p>深谷中的蘭吐出幽雅的得氣孤芳自賞。</p>
<p>一羣稷色的牛馬，在一間茅屋前面曠大的草地上，有的低頭在吃草，有的臥在溫柔陽光的下面，牠們都自由，逍遥，浸在這春光明媚的春日之中。</p>
<p>啊！美麗的春影呀！我陶醉了。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>氣力大不出來</h3>
<p>編者先生·　　我的父親，在三年前，失業了；他雖則以前從未失業過，並且收入也尙不惡，但是不知如何，他莧欠了三千餘元的債務。現在他徼倖找到了一個位置，每月的薪水，只有十幾塊錢；他在上海，另外有一個女人。這女人雖則常常害病，但説也奇怪，她竟會養了三個小孩子。在這生活程度昂貴的地方，父親所賺的十幾塊錢，還不夠維持他們的生活，那裹還談得到還債呢？我父親所欠的債，多半是我姑丈經手的，起初他因爲怕債主催索，還認痛代付了許多利息，現在他自己也失了業，當然不能繼續賠墊。因此債主催索益亟，逼得我這位五十多歲的姑丈，走頭無路，寢食不安；時常在我面前嘆苦經，但是我又每月賺得七塊錢，實在「氣力大不出」呀。</p>
<p>我原藉還有母親二妹一弟，他們靠着種幾畝租田，以及我每月寄回去的二三塊錢過活。我母親因爲中了「男大當婚」一句話的毒，去年替我訂下一頭婚姻，説明要入贅的，而且丵對方要我今年就過去。我想到了對方，不是又要加增負担了嗎？我現在所賺的每月七塊，數目雖小，但是每月兩三元的津貼，在家裹也不無小補。成了家，非但不能津貼家裹，恐怕還不夠用呢！所以我想决計反對。</p>
<p>我現在想集合幾個朋友，請他們拿出錢來，盡我的力量去做，由小而大，希望找到一條光明大道。編者先生，我的心事，眞所謂重重疊疊，難由言宣；更兼我十二歲就失了學，所以寫來不能有條不紊，請你原諒我，憐惜我，给我一個指導。（下略）</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　　編者按；「確守担保責任」，「父債子還」·都是舊道德裹所規定的「天經地義」；並且法律上也這樣規定着。但是你應當知道，這些「舊道德」·「法律」等等·都是資本家用來桎梏弱者的刑具。徐君的姑丈，在失業的當兒，還要他代人賠累，豈不是要他老命麽？徐君在這種情况之下，要他代他的父親，担任這三千多塊錢的債務，呌他那裹還會有出頭之日呢！徐君呀！徐君的姑丈呀，難道你願意受人桎梏，永無生路嗎？金錢這東西，寒不可衣，飢不可食，他們有錢出借的人，你就是不還他，他也不妨，好在他决不會等着這錢使呢！即使戰不過萬惡的資本家，那末「寃有頭」，「債有主」，「自作自受」有你父親去當的。</p>
<p>至於徐君的婚姻問題，原來説明是要入贅的，據我們知道，女家必定有相當的財力；至少過去之後，不會一定要你負担多大責任，所以我們以爲徐君似可試得。並且假此可以减輕你對於令尊所負債務的責任，到也一舉兩得。</p>
<p>説到你的出路問題，你想集合幾個朋友，請他們拿錢來，由你出力去做；這當然是一種極好的理想。不知你已經開始接洽了没有？他們的熊度又怎樣呢？照我們看來，在這個世界裹，怕終究找到一個肯拿出錢來由你去做的好朋友。好朋友大半是没有錢的。這裹我們倒又想起來了。你的岳家，情形怎樣？倘使他們有力量，同他們去商量，或許可以成功呢！</p>

<h3>煤山（續）</h3>
<p>— Ed　Falkowiki著　志翔節譯</p>
<p>在討論的中途，後面的門忽然開了，絲脫賴博進來了。他是工會的執行委員：身材高大，嘴唇上留着稀少的鬍鬚的匈牙利人；光滑的頭髮向後梳着，全副神氣表現着驕橫，兇猛的個性：穿着一套配身的衣服，淺藍色的領結點綴着一顆不很貴重的珠子，十足地表示他是個有威權的人。他靑年時代的這種活動使他謀得了這優越的職位，而他那種政治手腕，使他能維持現在的這職位直到二十年之久。平日尤故意喜歡和一班少年，激烈的分子爭鬥。他最得意的是遇到礦廠工人的爭執的事件，常能採用激烈的手段來解决。他的日常生活已達到了美國上等人的標準了。家住加丁街，這條街上住的大都是些闊人，如醫生或律師的住宅。他的妻常在有名的賭博場中進出，他的兒子在天主敎辦的大學中讀書。</p>
<p>爲了他家庭的這樣闊綽，他的擔負一天一天地加重；　所以，他的工會的執行委員的職位，在他是覺得很重要的。</p>
<p>絲脫賴博急速地登了講臺，靠着椅背，兩手很忙地裝烟，點着火，用力地吸着。再放下他的烟斗，把上身向前傾着。對熟悉的人們輕輕地點頭，將耳朶側着聽那正在講的人—一個高大的少年，眼珠如火般的明亮。</p>
<p>「如果現狀是這樣的繼續下去」，他説，「我們的工作還不如一點鼻的價値。那工頭每天發命令來壓迫我們，而這種命令只是催促着我們的反抗。我們不能承認這種不合理的命令」。</p>
<p>一個一個繼續地跑上講臺。他們的臉都漲滿着靑筋，煤點的手發展特别的厚而黃，似乎帶上一副天然的手套。「坑道」，「騾子」，「機械」，「鐵片」，「噸」，種種名詞在説話的喧鬧中吐出來。堅决而含着悲痛的話如子彈般射到充滿着烟霧的空氣中。　　「主席，諸位弟兄」，另一種聲音從烟霧加送出來。</p>
<p>「這位是譚恩」，主席向聽衆介紹這位講員。</p>
<p>「這時是我們應該議决幾件提案的時候了」。講員這樣地説。他是個勇敢的。人，他那副含着熱血的面孔，表示他是富於思想的，「無論我們是不是人類，無論我們能否容忍工頭來蹂躏我們，我們都必須有些表示。這張契約是讚成我們受壓迫契約，我們的工會領袖已簽字了。他們每月便可安心得了一千元的酬勞了他們的生活是怎樣的舒適啊！但，我們是這樣的吃苦—我們必須設法勇敢地來應付。這是反抗的時候了，同伴們—我説，我們應當罷工—直到减少我們的苦痛爲止。</p>
<p>「罷工」！熱烈的聲浪跟着湧出來。</p>
<p>主席站起來，用小棰敲敲桌子。　　「秩序，絲脫賴博有話要講」，他喊着。　　這位工會執行委員將烟筒放在桌子上，他那對猴子眼珠斜視着大衆，等着講臺下的雑亂聲停止。</p>
<p>「弟兄們」，他用高聲呌着，「你們要「罷工］，但，那是共産黨的手段。我們都不是共産黨，俄國才是共産黨的大本營。你們這種行動，使我們執行委員感到多麽的困難。你們罷工是很容易的，但結果又要我們來調解了」。</p>

<p>Our Military Front Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Bomb Shixia Town, Attempting to Cut Off Our Troop Supplies</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Attack Changshanyu; Our Mines Cause Casualties</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning at 9:00 AM, the Kawara unit and a part of the Seta unit, totaling 4,000 men, along with 10,000 puppet troops, carrying over 20 field guns and multiple armored vehicles, jointly launched a general offensive against our troops stationed at Qingshiliang, 40 li southwest of Luanping. The artillery fire was extremely intense, and there was also heavy aerial bombardment. Our troops under General Wang Yizhe fought bravely. As of 5:00 PM, the battle was still ongoing, and our front line remained unchanged. Enemy planes also came to Gubeikou this afternoon, aiming to destroy our roads and cut off our supplies. The Japanese consider Shixia Town, 45 li southwest of Gubeikou, to be a route for supplying our front lines. This afternoon, they sent planes to bomb the area, causing losses to the residents. Outside Xifengkou, the fighting was not very intense today. Kuancheng remains in our hands. Sun Dianying's troops in the north are fighting against the Japanese army. The Japanese Motegi Brigade suffered heavy casualties and has dispatched the Matsuda units and others as reinforcements. Reports of the Japanese occupying Weichang are unconfirmed. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gubeikou telegram: This morning, the Japanese army issued a general attack order. A total of 1,500 men from the Kawara Regiment, supported by four aircraft, are engaged in fierce fighting with General Wang's troops. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 5:00 PM this afternoon, ten Japanese planes bombed Shixia Town, causing heavy losses to our merchants and residents. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, the enemy attacking our Changshanyu position suffered heavy casualties due to landmines and our ambushes. They retreated towards Luanping in disarray.

On the 7th, a total of eight planes flew to Gubeikou Town, dropping over forty bombs. The remaining eight planes bombed our various defense positions, dropping bombs. The residents of Gubeikou had evacuated in advance, so although the enemy planes bombed fiercely, apart from destroying many civilian houses, there were no casualties among the people. This morning, one enemy plane flew to Pingquan for reconnaissance and bombed Bashi Ying and the rear of Gaolouzi, dropping one bomb west of Bashi Ying and two bombs behind Gaolouzi. The explosions were very loud. Our side has prepared anti-aircraft guns to fire back. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gubeikou phone call: Three enemy planes carrying heavy bombs bombed inside and outside Gubeikou Town at 7:00 AM this morning. The sound was like thunder. More than ten residents were killed or injured. Residents have been ordered by the county government to move to Yinbishan inside Shijiang Mountain to avoid enemy air raids. The enemy, realizing that our main force is in Gubeikou and will defend it to the death, and launch a counter-offensive towards Chengde, considers the Chengde-Gubeikou line extremely important. They have now concentrated their main forces, such as the Kawahara, Kawara, Suzuki, and Hattori units, totaling over 30,000 men, to attack Gubeikou in order to encircle and capture it. The Japanese army has established an airfield in Nanyingzi, south of Chengde, with thirty aircraft flown in from Chaoyang for combat reconnaissance, preparing for a large-scale attack on Gubeikou. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gubeikou telegram: On the evening of the 7th, the enemy Kawahara unit, a mixed force of cavalry, infantry, and artillery numbering one thousand men, with tanks as the vanguard, launched a fierce attack on our Changshanyu position.

At that time, the enemy only had two or three hundred men and ten or more armored vehicles. Over the past two days, the enemy gradually increased to several thousand men, with over a hundred vehicles, and later even sent a puppet army regiment with several cannons, building fortifications to defend themselves. Upon hearing the news, our troops in the Kuancheng area outside the pass immediately dispatched powerful units to intercept them in separate directions. Meanwhile, Shang Zhen's Huang Guanghua Division rushed to reinforce them overnight. As of 4:00 PM, the fighting was still fierce. By around 6:00 PM, the enemy was surrounded on all sides and unable to hold out, retreating northeastward. Lengkou was recovered, and our defense of Luanping was further consolidated. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Previously, the enemy Hattori advance unit of over a thousand men, carrying over ten field guns and dozens of tanks, occupied our Lengkou. Our Shang Zhen unit stationed in Qian'an urgently dispatched Huang Guanghua leading the Jiang and Lin Regiments to reinforce, and Lengkou was recaptured. The enemy fled outside the pass.

<h3>Japanese Claim They Will Not Enter Shanhaiguan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign news: The Japanese Kwantung Army Command ordered all Japanese troops not to enter Shanhaiguan. This is likely a smokescreen.

We have prepared and will not be taken advantage of by the enemy. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Zhengzhou) Chairman Chiang, heading north from Hankou, recently arrived in Zhengzhou and spoke to reporters. He said that the loss of Chengde and the fall of the Northeast, the lack of steadfastness in the military, and the loss of national territory are deeply painful. As the General Commander, Zhongzheng is solely responsible and will resign to apologize to the people. However, unless the lost national territory is recovered one day, he will never dare to abandon the responsibility of resisting Japan. This is not only for national self-defense to seek the survival of the nation, but also to resist power and fight for world justice. He hopes that all compatriots across the country will be aware of the imminent danger of national extinction, sacrifice their private views, unite in spirit, strengthen themselves, be self-reliant, and never give up. The whole country should unite to face it. This is the only bright path today. Zhongzheng will advance northwards and strive harder to be a pioneer for the people and repay the Party and the country.

During the discussion, the atmosphere in the meeting was extremely tense. As a result, because Chairman Chiang had already gone north to coordinate the resistance against Japan, and only received a telegram reporting his whereabouts, the true situation in North China was not yet considered clear. After Chiang sent a detailed telegram to the Central Government, the Central Political Council will hold an emergency meeting to discuss it. It is heard that after the meeting adjourned, the Standing Committee telegraphed Chiang in the name of the Committee to solicit his opinion, and it is expected that a reply will be received this morning.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The American Financial Panic and the World Economy</h3>
<p>㈠ The Main Causes of the Financial Panic The United States of America, possessing more than 4 billion US dollars in gold, has the name of a golden country. After the First World War, it firmly held the reins of the world's finances. Even the experienced Great Britain was in awe and did not dare to compete. However, since the fall of stock prices in the autumn of 1929, it has been able to barely maintain the situation amidst the waves of panic. However, at the end of February of this year, a major crack occurred. It started locally. All banks in the "State of Michigan" announced their closure. In less than a week, it spread throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Why did such a huge trend occur in the wealthy United States? Is it because people are uncertain, and they withdraw money in groups, causing the credit of banks to fail? In fact, the withdrawal of money is just a fuse. It is not enough to cause panic throughout the United States, or even affect the world. Now, I will only describe the general and important causes as follows.</p>
<p>First, Foreign investment cannot be recovered. After the European War, the United States took over the position of Great Britain in dominating the world economy. Its total overseas investment is more than 15.7 billion, and the war debts of European countries are not included. Since the economic panic has spread throughout the world, agricultural panics in various countries have risen one after another. Not only did the German president issue an economic danger signal, but the whole of Europe was also shaken. After the proposal to suspend the payment of war debts and reparations for one year was put into practice, there was still no sign of improvement. The world economy has instead deteriorated. The South American countries have all announced that they cannot repay their foreign debts. Therefore, the long-term overseas investment of the United States is not easy to recover for a while, and even short-term credit is in a state of poor turnover.</p>
<p>Second, War debt repayment, from disputes to stagnation. Most European countries, except Britain, France, and Italy, are unable to pay. Even for Britain and France, they take from others to repay the United States. For example, France relies on reparations, and Britain relies on the war debts of various countries to Britain. Now that the Lausanne Conference has decided to suspend reparations, war debts will inevitably be cancelled. This formed the opposition between the United States of America and Europe at the end of last year. Afterwards, although Britain and Italy declared their intention to pay, their intention not to continue paying was very clear. Moreover, since they have repaid US debts, they will inevitably ask other countries to repay their debts to Britain. France, Belgium, and other countries have always insisted on not paying. Therefore, war debts, which are all securities, have affected the US market. Credit guarantees (various securities issued with war debts as guarantees) are all shaken.</p>
<p>Third, Overproduction and narrow market. The movement of industrial rationalization is prevalent. The productivity of US industries has been increasing. However, it also brings about a reduction in general consumption. The realization of industrial rationalization is due to the development of mechanical power and the reduction of labor. On the contrary, it is a chronic increase in unemployed workers. How can the unemployed maintain consumption beyond survival? - General purchasing power declines. This is the root cause. Gradually spreading, it makes the domestic market increasingly depressed. In addition, high tariff barriers are built, and the boundaries between countries are deepened. It is even more difficult for the United States to seek markets overseas. In addition, with the rise of national capital in various colonial and semi-colonial countries, it is almost impossible to expand the market.</p>
<p>Fourth, The stimulation of the market by the election competition. During the election competition, in order to stimulate people's hearts and reverse the decline, the Republican Party used political methods in the market to raise stock prices and make the industry excited. Therefore, in the past July, August, September, and three months, the declining market gradually recovered. After November, it fell again. After the new president was elected, the excitement disappeared, and the tired appearance arrived.</p>
<p>㈡ Response to the world</p>
<p>The American financial panic has spread throughout the country. The impact is not limited to the Americas. The United States has been on the throne of the world's finances for more than ten years. European countries, whether Britain or France, are in second place and are led by the US dollar. Although the tidal wave of world economic panic arrived, Great Britain also abandoned its gold standard system and adopted an inflationary policy to suppress currency prices and raise prices. Only the United States remains the same and does not move at all. However, after this storm, even if President Roosevelt uses his nimble wrist and political strategies to control the development of the economic panic, if he cannot eliminate the first three causes mentioned in the previous section (opening up new investment markets, solving war debts—recovering war debts, expanding domestic and foreign purchasing power), the maximum effect will be to smooth out the storm in a short time. Moreover, restricting the export of cash, even prohibiting export, and suppressing private storage of cash are only maintaining the gold standard and a disguised inflation policy. What the consequences will be is worthy of our deep attention and research. Although the French Republic in the European continent is less affected by the economic panic, its production index is only 74% compared to 1928. After this storm, can it be sure to maintain the gold standard? Great Britain can sincerely strive to conserve, or perhaps strive to regain its original position. However, with the overseas market being narrow and the domestic unemployed workers being impossible to eliminate, it is also difficult to avoid exposing its weaknesses. Japan's financial relationship with the United States is in a rather unfavorable position. The sale of raw silk will be greatly hit by this storm. Export trade will inevitably shrink by one-third to one-half. However, the United States is busy calming the financial panic, so Japan can calmly invade our country. Therefore, the countries clearly know about the use of force in Jehol, but do not say a word. The United States clearly knows about it, but is breathless and silent. Therefore, in terms of economics, the American financial panic has a bad influence on Japan, while in terms of politics, it is the opposite. It has actually helped Japan's recklessness.</p>
<p>So what will the trend be in the future? American industrial capitalists, suffering from the blow of the economic panic, want to get out of this predicament and open up new paths, and cannot welcome "price increases." In other words, it is to adopt an inflationary policy and stop the gold standard. However, the banking capital, which is in opposition to industrial capital, stubbornly opposes the opinion of "inflation policy." Even if the industrial sectors and domestic and foreign trade are extremely deteriorated, the bankers will definitely not bow their heads to the "inflation policy." Moreover, US financial capital is actually superior to industrial capital. How can they easily agree to stop the gold standard? However, as the general economic situation deteriorates, the banking capital has to make relative concessions. The result is to take emergency measures during the war, prohibiting the export of gold, while still not abandoning the gold standard system. What the consequences will be is worthy of our deep attention and research.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee: Soviet Russia Declines to Participate</h3>
<p>Reason for Statement</p>
<p>Soviet Russia, a Non-Member State, Insufficient to Influence League of Nations Resolutions</p>
<p>Report Deemed Not Fully Compatible with Russian Views</p>
<p>Hostility Towards Russia in the Committee; Coordination Will Be Difficult</p>
<p>But Consistently Supporting a Fair Resolution of the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<h3>Expectation of Unquestionable Acceptance of Invitation by the United States</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia has declined the League of Nations' invitation to join the 21-member Advisory Committee of the League of Nations. The committee's task is to assist in achieving a resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov sent a lengthy telegram to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, explaining the reasons for Soviet Russia's refusal to join. He stated that some of the League of Nations' resolutions regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute were in line with Soviet Russia's views. However, the report of the League of Nations Committee, adopted by the League of Nations General Assembly, contained recommendations for applying these basic principles to the Sino-Japanese dispute that were not fully compatible with the aforementioned basic principles. As Soviet Russia is not a member of the League of Nations, it cannot influence the resolutions of the League of Nations General Assembly. Furthermore, the majority of the countries participating in the Advisory Committee have historically been hostile to Russia. From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese conflict, Soviet Russia adopted a strictly neutral stance, motivated by the desire to do its utmost to prevent the expansion of the war. Soviet Russia has consistently been willing to support the actions and proposals of international organizations and governments aimed at seeking a swift and fair resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute and safeguarding peace in the Far East. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government has decided not to participate in the League of Nations Advisory Committee. This intention has been formally telegraphed to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Drummond, by Mr. Litvinov. The telegram was published in local newspapers today. According to Mr. Litvinov's statement, the Soviet government, after considering the proposals in Mr. Drummond's letter and studying the accompanying documents, has reached the following conclusions: The resolutions of the League of Nations and the report and recommendations of the Special Committee of Nineteen are based on the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Soviet Union is a signatory only to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and not to the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Nine-Power Treaty. Fundamentally, the Soviet Union declares its policy principles to be that all countries should have the right to self-determination, to exercise free will, and to be free from external oppression, firmly opposing any cession or reparations demanded as a result of victory or forcible occupation. Absolute respect for the territorial integrity of other countries and their social, political, economic, and administrative independence, non-recognition of any means other than peaceful ones for resolving international disputes, and strict adherence to international agreements that include these principles are natural consequences. The Soviet government's proposed plan for complete and universal disarmament aims to eliminate those who undermine these principles. Recently, the Soviet Union made a proposal at the Disarmament Conference to unite the international community against the various pretexts often used by those who violate peace agreements to conceal their violent actions. The Kellogg-Briand Pact and other agreements of a similar nature only encompass a portion of the principles put forward in the Soviet Union's proposal. To some extent, the League of Nations' resolutions on the Sino-Japanese conflict are close to the principles of the Soviet Union's peace policy, that is, some basic points are consistent with the Soviet government's views. However, the report of the Committee of Nineteen, adopted by the League of Nations General Assembly, contains recommendations on the Sino-Japanese issue that I feel are not entirely consistent with the aforementioned basic points and, on many serious issues, are contrary to them. The purpose of the Advisory Committee produced by the League of Nations General Assembly is to assist the General Assembly in completing its tasks. The Committee must make recommendations to the League of Nations General Assembly. In this regard, the Soviet Union, as a non-member of the League of Nations, cannot exert its influence. Another task of the Advisory Committee is to help create unified action between the member states and non-member states of the League of Nations. However, among the members or presumed members of the Advisory Committee, the majority, namely thirteen out of twenty-two countries, do not have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and are therefore hostile to the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is difficult for this committee to achieve the goal of unified action with the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union cannot negotiate with the majority of the countries in the committee, nor can it easily contact countries with similar relations separately. Even with countries that maintain diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, it is still questionable whether they will consider the interests of the Soviet Union as suggested in the recommendations of the Committee of Nineteen. Due to the aforementioned circumstances, the Soviet government feels unable to agree to the League of Nations' resolutions or participate in the Advisory Committee at this time. From the beginning, the Soviet government hoped to prevent the development of the Sino-Japanese conflict and avoid a fresh global outbreak. Therefore, it has adopted a policy of absolute neutrality. In order to achieve its neutrality and peace policy, the Soviet government will consistently support any actions or proposals put forward by international organizations and governments that can seek a fair and rapid resolution of this conflict in order to safeguard peace in the Far East. (TASS, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Russia's reply rejecting participation in the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese dispute was anticipated long ago. Although the Soviet Russian government cited the fact that thirteen of the twenty-two members of the committee do not recognize Soviet Russia as a reason for not participating, the true reason, according to one of its representatives, was explained before the League of Nations report was sent to Russia, namely that Soviet Russia does not want to be a "nursemaid." The United States' reply has been delayed due to the change of government. However, local sources believe that the United States will undoubtedly accept the invitation. According to the United States State Department, it has recently notified the League of Nations representative that the United States is prepared to accept the invitation, but that this matter will be left to the new State Department to decide. The Committee of Twenty-One is now awaiting receipt of the United States' reply before convening a meeting. However, the discussion on the arms embargo issue in the Paraguay-Bolivia dispute will set a precedent for action in the Far East. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations proposed establishing a negotiation committee for the Sino-Japanese issue, with the planned members being Germany, Italy, France, Britain, Spain, Ireland, Czechoslovakia, Canada, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The Soviet Union has decided not to participate in this committee. Whether the United States will participate and cooperate is still not formally stated. Yan Huiqing will go to Geneva after presenting his credentials to the ministry. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Conspiracy Exposed as Collusion with the Netherlands Fails</h3>
<p>Transformed Airplane Landing Field Discovered in Borneo</p>
<p>Also Wants to Establish Air Base in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>(London) Today's Daily Express published a dispatch from its diplomatic correspondent, stating that Japan recently proposed to the Dutch government that it would like to conclude a non-aggression pact in exchange for the "right of cession" of Dutch New Guinea. The reason why the negotiations failed was that Dutch aviators discovered a transformed airplane landing field from the sky in the areas where Japanese residents lived and in the interior of Borneo. The Dutch government</p>
<p>therefore became suspicious and declined to</p>
<p>open these negotiations with Japan in The Hague. The Japanese plan is to establish disguised air bases in the Dutch East Indies, halfway between Taiwan and Australia. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources in diplomatic circles here, the mission of Japanese representative Yosuke Matsuoka's visit to the Netherlands was to order crude oil from the Dutch territories to replace American goods. The Japanese side proposed as a condition that Japan and the Netherlands sign a non-aggression treaty, but in wartime, all crude oil produced in Dutch Borneo would be sold to Japan. Japan would then dispatch naval and technical personnel to cooperate with the Dutch government. (China United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Deliberates on Withdrawal from League of Nations</h3>
<p>Diplomatic Strategy to Change</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida paid a visit to the Emperor today to report on the content of the proposed Japanese withdrawal from the League of Nations. Then, the cabinet convened in the evening to formally approve the dispatch. It is expected that the Privy Council will deliberate on this matter on March 3rd and 10th, and the formal notification to the League of Nations of Japan's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations will be around March 20th. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, after the Japanese government withdraws from the League of Nations, it will change its long-standing diplomatic strategy. Its new principle is to focus on the interests of the Far East, centering on major powers as the basic principle. The content is as follows: (1) Permanently abandon the League of Nations supremacy, and will never return to the League of Nations in the future. No longer participate in all meetings convened by the League of Nations. (2) International conferences held outside the League of Nations, such as disarmament conferences, arbitration treaties, non-aggression treaties, or stability and security agreements, etc., will still be attended if they are meetings or negotiations to ensure peace. (3) Fundamentally reorganize foreign embassies and revise the appointment orders of diplomats. For small countries that opposed Japan in the League of Nations, the qualifications of the embassy will be downgraded, and a secretary-level officer will be appointed in place of the ambassador. For embassies in major countries, such as London, Washington, and Paris, several minister-level or counselor-level personnel will be added to make diplomacy rational and economical. Change the appointment order of diplomats, emphasizing the importance of talent. Although it does not abandon the Anglo-American coordination principle, it must intensify its focus on the interests of the Far East, and its diplomatic policy will also be based on Asia, changing the new strategy.

<h3>US Secretary of the Navy Declares Active Naval Construction</h3>
<p>Will Proceed as Soon as Circumstances Permit</p>
<p>Navy Will Remain Concentrated in the Pacific Before the Far East Dispute Is Resolved</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 7th - Today, Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared that he will do his best to build the United States Navy within the limits stipulated by the London Treaty and will begin as soon as circumstances permit. Swanson also said that the United States Navy will continue to concentrate in the Pacific before the Far East dispute is resolved.</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, when Swanson announced the retention of the entire fleet in the Pacific, he did not, like previous naval officers, use cost-cutting as a reason. He directly declared that the purpose of the US Navy is to protect American commerce and lives and property in times of turmoil, so it must be stationed in the place where it is most needed. He also said that the duration of the US fleet's stay in the Pacific depends on the State Department's judgment. As for whether to order a part of the fleet to return to the Atlantic when the situation in the Far East seems to change, he was unwilling to guarantee it in advance, only stating that after the State Department determines that the situation in the Far East has fully stabilized, a part of the fleet or a patrol fleet may be able to return to the Atlantic base.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Resigns to Take Responsibility</h3>
<p>Claims that Honesty and Trustworthiness Were Not Sufficient, and Command Was Improper</p>
<p>Begs for a Clear Order to Be Dismissed and for Personnel to Be Sent to Take Over</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the central government yesterday, resigning to take responsibility, roughly stating that the change in Rehe had not exceeded ten days, and thousands of miles of land had been reduced, so that he had failed to live up to the government's earnest supervision and responsibility, and he had no way to face the people's heavy entrustment. Inner faults were piling up, and hundreds of mouths could not excuse him. He begged for a quick clear order to be dismissed from all positions to show punishment and warning, and at the same time, he quickly sent senior officials to take over to extend national discipline, etc. (Special Dispatch, 8th) (Beiping) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the government on the 7th, resigning to take responsibility. The original telegram was extremely long, and excerpts are as follows: Since the fall of the Northeast, he has been working hard, hoping to atone for his sins and strive to redeem himself. Unexpectedly, the change in Rehe has not exceeded ten days. It is due to various reasons that the bad results have been brewed. All of them are due to the fact that Xueliang's honesty and trustworthiness were not sufficient, and the command was improper, so that he has failed to live up to the government's earnest supervision and responsibility, and he has no way to face the people's heavy entrustment. Moreover, when Xueliang was seriously ill in the summer of the 20th year and had not recovered, he suffered the change of September 18th. His duties were in charge, and how dare he steal peace for a moment? Life and death are put aside, and</p>
<p>in the past two months, coping has become more and more difficult, and things have gone against his wishes. Delaying for one day is a fault for one day. Even if Xueliang is crushed to pieces, it will not help the country or benefit the overall situation. He should beg for a quick clear order to be dismissed from all positions to show punishment and warning, and quickly send senior officials to take over to extend national discipline. The opportunity for change is in this one move. Xueliang will dedicate all the years of his life to serving the country. The end of the telegram said that even if the government is lenient with his condemnation and encourages him to reform himself, he is deeply afraid that the fault of occupying a position without merit will be small, and the crime of misleading the country will be great, etc. It is heard that after this telegram was sent, the government has not yet replied to Beiping.

<h3>Impact of Plummeting Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Most Unfavorable to Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An economic expert talked about how the plummeting gold prices will not only affect the Far East, but the economies of various countries around the world will also be greatly shocked. The most unfavorable country is Japan, because Japan exports more than 480 million US dollars of goods to the United States every year. Since our country is a silver standard country and has suffered from years of commercial depression, according to customs statistics, there are not many items imported from the United States every year. Regardless of whether gold prices fall or the United States abolishes the gold standard, it is beneficial and harmless to the entire China. The current disadvantages are only for (1) speculators who hoard cash, (2) those who store large amounts of cash in American banks, and (3) those who engage in foreign exchange trading in the United States, which is a very small number. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Dr. Ma Yinchu, an economics expert, talked to a reporter from a certain newspaper in Hangzhou while ill about the US dollar tide, saying that it was caused by the German reparations issue, domestic overproduction, the adoption of protective tariffs by various countries, and the high price of gold. The current ban on gold exports means that cash is useless, and the abolition of the gold standard is aimed at lowering gold prices, raising commodity prices, and reviving factories. He also said that the impact on China's economy is not very large, but it will affect various countries, and they will all be too busy to take care of themselves, and our hopes for American assistance are also hopeless.

(2) Merchants have a conscience and love their country, striving to maintain market prices to calm people's hearts. (3) Merchants guarantee that the fund is stable with bonds for the war, that is, the principal will be repaid by lottery during the military period, which is also one of the reasons.

<h3>Passengers Rescued from the Andong Arrive in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Those rescued from the ill-fated Andong Ship have arrived here today on the Anhui Ship. According to investigations, there were a total of 110 people going to Haikou via Zunlu.

According to the British warship Folkestone, which was docked next to it, the ship is barely visible in the waves and the hull is gradually collapsing. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Travels to Geneva Today to Salvage Military Reduction Conference Stalemate</h3>
<p>Will First Confer With French Premier in Paris on All Matters</p>
<p>Germany Opposes Five-Power Meeting, Will Not Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>French Mutual Assistance Pact Plan Suffers Setback</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 7th: Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour received British Ambassador to France Tyrrell today. The Ambassador stated that British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will arrive in Paris on Thursday evening and stay at the British Embassy. That evening, they will discuss the international situation and the progress of the disarmament conference with the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour. Since the formation of the current French cabinet, this is the first time that French cabinet members have held talks with the British authorities. It is generally speculated that MacDonald and Simon are likely to depart for Geneva on Friday evening. On Friday during the day, the British and French</p>
<p>authorities will continue to hold talks. Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour is also expected to leave Paris on Friday evening. It is unknown whether Prime Minister Daladier will also go to Geneva. According to reports from State Council personnel, the French Prime Minister's decision to go to Geneva will only be made during the British-French talks on Friday.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 8th: The press has received official news that Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi was entrusted by Prime Minister MacDonald to convey a letter to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, inviting him to go to Geneva to participate in the talks. MacDonald will depart from London for Paris at 11:00 AM tomorrow. After arriving in Paris, he will meet with French Prime Minister Daladier. The British and French Prime Ministers will continue to talk until the next day. The British Prime Minister will leave Paris for Geneva on Friday evening or Saturday morning.</p>
<p>▲Guomin, Berlin, 7th: According to reliable sources, Hitler does not want to go to Geneva to participate in the Five-Power talks aimed at reviving the disarmament conference because he is too busy with domestic affairs. The Cabinet meeting today will also discuss this matter. It is felt that the current situation in Geneva does not require Hitler to personally take action, and other cabinet members do not need to go either. Germany has clearly stated its attitude towards the matters currently being discussed, and there has been no change now.</p>
<p>▲Guomin, Geneva, 8th: France's persistent demands for security have suffered a setback today. The European Mutual Assistance Pact plan it proposed, although passed by the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference, will have to be abandoned because six countries, including Germany, Italy, Soviet Russia, Austria, Hungary, and the Netherlands, are unwilling to participate in the drafting committee of the treaty. However, the French representatives have not expressed disappointment and have proposed abandoning the plan to organize a small committee, so the discussion of the pact has been postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p>▲Guomin, Geneva, 7th: The European Continental Mutual Assistance Treaty was passed today by the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference with fourteen votes in favor and five votes against. Britain and Soviet Russia did not vote, while Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and the Netherlands voted against it. The reason is that the treaty is empty and vague, so they are willing to join it only after fundamental solutions to various disarmament issues are found.</p>
<h3>British Air Force Budget</h3>
<p>Smaller Than Last Year But Military Strength Remains the Same</p>
<p>Australia Asks the British Government to Replace Old Warships With New Ones</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 8th: The Air Force budget released today is estimated at £17.5 million, a net reduction of approximately £340,000 from last year. The Air Force's military strength remains unchanged, but the number of personnel will be reduced by 1,000 to 31,000 next year. The budget includes a woman's statement about the spirit of research and progress in civil aviation. For example, passengers can talk comfortably in the aircraft of the Imperial Airways Company. This is due to the use of scientific methods to eliminate the sound between the engines. The article also predicts that a weekly scheduled air service between Britain and Australia will be opened this summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Canberra, 8th: The Australian Federal Government has decided to ask the British Government to replace the four old Australian warships with four new destroyers with higher speed and longer sailing range. The aircraft carrier Albatross will be laid up and its sailors will be assigned to the new destroyers.</p>

<h3>US Dollar Crisis Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Promulgates New Regulations Allowing Issuance of Notes</p>
<p>Some National Banks Reopen Partially</p>
<p>Privately Hoarded Money Continues to Circulate on the Market</p>
<p>President Considers Currency Procedures, Preparing to Submit to Congress</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 7th: The New York Federal Reserve Bank announced that Treasury Secretary Woodin has approved the restoration of currency lending to member banks, provided that the banks hand over their gold certificates and securities to the Reserve Bank in exchange for other forms of currency. This announcement makes it easier for member banks to engage in limited banking business, such as paying salaries and transporting food.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 7th: As a result of the passage of a bill by the Legislative Assembly today, New York Governor Lehman now has dictatorial powers over banks and insurance companies throughout New York State. The Treasury Department has allowed New York to issue notes as a temporary medium of exchange within the state. However, when the notes are nationalized, the notes issued by New York should be withdrawn immediately. According to the regulations promulgated by Treasury Secretary Woodin, national or state banks may conduct their usual business, providing food and medicine when absolutely necessary to help the poor, and issuing wages or expenses to maintain unemployment.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 7th: Treasury Secretary Woodin has authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to operate normally at American financial institutions to handle the business of exchanging American debt. It is said that this announcement by the Treasury Secretary is purely a matter of formality and has nothing to do with the general public.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, Washington, 7th: Today, national banks across the United States have reopened under special permission from the Treasury Department, in accordance with the restricted rules issued yesterday, so that salaries can be paid and food can be transported. According to a report from the Irving Trust Company of New York, privately hoarded money has been continuously withdrawn and many new accounts have been opened with banks, because this cash is stored separately by banks as trust money and is not subject to withdrawal restrictions. As of today, the money paid out by banks is generally another currency that is not related to gold, because clearing house scrip and other approved money notes must be used uniformly starting on Friday in accordance with the new order from the Treasury Department. In addition, many people expect this partial reopening method to be extended beyond Friday. Although banks in various places do not use gold, they can still meet the legal needs of depositors and have not refused to do so. Before using scrip, the banks were extremely cautious about payments and had to be questioned by several staff members. After being able to show that the money was indeed for paying wages or purchasing food and other necessary items, a certain amount was paid. The main reason why Woodin changed the closure method was to enable workers to get wages without suffering losses from discounts, and to allow employers to maintain their original workers without increasing unemployment. This is also one reason, so the payment of wages is listed as the primary purpose of payment. After the issuance of scrip, the domestic financial situation should be greatly alleviated. Although Treasury Secretary Woodin declared yesterday that the state would not issue scrip from the Clearing House, it is said that he is now considering issuing a kind of state money note as a medium of exchange in emergencies, for free circulation throughout the country. However, regarding this issue, nothing has been expressed to the outside world so far. Also, the stock and commodity exchanges remained closed today.</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, New York, 8th: Following the House of Representatives, the Senate also passed a government proposal authorizing banks in New York State to issue common notes, with the property of each bank as collateral. At the same time, it also approved a bill to create a common note joint venture. The banks in fourteen states, including New York, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Texas, Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, California, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, and North Carolina, have all reopened after receiving Treasury Secretary Woodin's order to allow them to resume operations. However, many banks felt hesitant because they had not received orders from the governors of their respective states, and then closed again.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 8th: The New York Times discussed the recent development of the banking crisis in Washington and other places, saying that it is now heard that President Roosevelt is discussing a currency program divided into eight items, which will be submitted to Congress. The contents are as follows: (1) Preserve the gold standard as the basis of the currency; (2) Issue 2,000,000,000 yuan in temporary emergency currency; (3) Withhold various gold coins and gold bars; (4) Completely suspend the cash withdrawals of gold notes; (5) Set a deadline for the public to hand over their hoarded gold to the national treasury, and impose taxes if the deadline is exceeded; (6) The authorities have the right to search safe deposit boxes and other personal storage items to check for hidden gold; (7) Increase the silver content in coins.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 8th: The programs that President Roosevelt is currently considering, which will be submitted to the special session of Congress on Thursday, mainly focus on maintaining the gold standard, with important safeguards attached. As for the original plan, which is to issue notes or Federal Reserve notes to implement a measured monetary expansion, it is now questionable whether the new government will adopt it in the future. It is said that the draft submitted to Congress includes articles on suspending the exchange of banknotes for cash, cracking down on private cash hoarding, purchasing silver, and increasing the silver content in silver coins.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 8th: One of the complicated problems currently encountered by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department is the 400,959,000 yuan in cash deposited by New York savings banks in the accounts of foreign central banks. The ownership of this cash belongs to foreign central banks. This amount has been allocated from the gold reserves of the United States, but foreign banks cannot withdraw it under President Roosevelt's gold ban. When the Reserve Bank reopens in the future, foreign banks have the right to sell their gold to the Reserve Bank. If so, the cash reserves of the United States can be increased. At the same time, the deposits of foreign banks in the United States will also increase, and they can be withdrawn from the foreign exchange market. If so, the value of the US dollar will continue to fall. While the United States</p>
<p>can obtain valuable assets, it must also bear the troublesome international debt. How this gold should be handled will be determined by Treasury Secretary Woodin. Woodin can only treat this gold as something kept in custody by the United States, and should not allow it to be moved or exported, or treat this gold as one of the bank's deposits and force it to sell it to the United States and transfer it to the US dollar deposit account.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 8th: New York Governor Lehman has appointed former Governor Smith as the director of the New York State Note Association. The proposal to organize the association has been passed by both houses of the state legislature. The National Savings Bank has deposits of 4,000,000,000 yuan and 3 million depositors. It has now been decided that those who want to withdraw money must give written notice 60 days in advance. This measure will be implemented when the bank reopens.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Toronto, 7th: Today, prices on the stock exchange here are all rising. Canadian banks that deal in American currency offer American dollar prices that are higher than Canadian dollar prices by 1% to 1.8%, that is, 115 to 118 Canadian dollars are equal to 100 American dollars. The American dollar exchange rate in London is 4.20 to 4.22.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 8th: Today, foreign exchange transactions are still open as usual, except for the American dollar.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Osaka, 8th: Exchanges here began operations this afternoon. At the opening, all major securities fell by about ten yuan.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th: Due to the American financial panic, there is no doubt that the American exchange rate will rise. Exports, which had become smooth due to the fall of the Japanese yen, will inevitably be hit. At the same time, the outflow of capital from the country is also worrying. Officials and the public are racking their brains to come up with countermeasures. However, the current law to prevent capital flight cannot prevent the clever speculation of selling American dollars and</p>
<p>buying Japanese yen. Therefore, the government is urgently implementing the Exchange Control Law, and the Upper House also expressed sympathy and decided to expedite the review. If the bill is passed, it will be implemented early.</p>
<h3>Germany Under the Control of the National Socialist Party</h3>

Since yesterday, the Berlin City Hall has changed to hang the black, white, and red flag, and the Police Headquarters has hung the swastika flag. Göring issued an order today that governors of the provinces must not oppose the hanging of the national flag. The square in front of the Altona City Hall has been renamed Adolf Hitler Square. The names of all streets throughout the country that use the names of people who support Marxism will be changed.</p>
<p>▲Guomin, Berlin, 7th: According to today's gazette, the new parliament will hold an opening ceremony in the Potsdam Garrison Church in the first week of April, but subsequent meetings will not be held there. The location has not yet been selected. The gazette also anticipates that the government will immediately present a bill granting full power to the government, which must be passed by two-thirds of the members.</p>
<h3>Trends in Greek Politics</h3>

<p>General Plastiras Flees to Egypt</p>
<p>▲National News, Athens, 7th: Greek politics have changed rapidly in recent days, with the trend seemingly heading towards the restoration of the monarchy. Today, General Vosonis' new government appointed the foreign minister, finance minister, and economic minister. Martial law has been lifted, and General Plastiras will be allowed to leave the country. However, Vosonis' cabinet fell in less than a day because General Kondylis threatened him with armed force, forcing Vosonis to hand over power to the leader of the royalist party, former Prime Minister Tsaidetalis. At the same time, he demanded the arrest of General Plastiras, but Plastiras had already fled to Egypt by plane, so Vosonis resigned.</p>

<h3>Governor-General of the Philippines Resigns</h3>
<p>Before the Arrival of Cummings</p>
<p>The Deputy Governor Will Serve as Acting Governor</p>
<p>▲National News, Washington, 7th: U.S. President Roosevelt has approved the resignation of Philippine Governor-General Roosevelt today. In the order, he praised his service and acknowledged his willingness to sacrifice his private interests to continue serving if necessary. However, he stated that there seemed to be no strong need to go against his wishes at this time. Therefore, he appointed Deputy Governor Hare to serve as acting governor until the new Governor Cummings arrives. Cummings is currently serving as acting Attorney General and is expected to depart for his post in about six weeks. It is noted that although Philippine Governor Roosevelt is a cousin of the President, he is a strong Republican and gave a speech on the radio for former President Hoover during the election campaign.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Have a Second Earthquake</h3>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Passes Through Hankou and Heads North</h3>
<p>Flying from Jiangxi to Hankou, then Taking a Train North</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states: The fall of Jehol has aroused national indignation, and the people are eagerly awaiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in the north to oversee the military, as if hoping for a good harvest. Zhang Xueliang, the acting chairman of the Beiping Military Council, also telegraphed to welcome Chiang to Beiping to take charge. Chiang, seeing that the military operations against the bandits in Jiangxi Province were progressing smoothly, decided to go north for inspection. At 11:00 AM on the 6th, Chiang flew from Jiangxi to Hankou in his own plane. The heavy snow had just cleared, and the weather was very cold. He arrived safely in Hankou at 3:00 PM. His entourage had previously traveled from Nanchang to Tao, where they transferred to the Chu You warship and headed west, arriving on the same afternoon at 5:00 PM. Various agencies here received little prior notice. Only important military and political officials welcomed him at Wangjiadun Airport. After Chiang disembarked, he took a car to Jianghanguan, where he transferred to a small ferry to cross the river to Wuchang, going directly to the General Headquarters for a temporary rest. His entourage rested at the Hankou Headquarters office. Chiang immediately instructed the Pinghan Railway Management Committee to prepare two trains and keep the fires burning, ready to depart. The guards boarded the train at 8:00 PM, waiting for his arrival. After resting at the General Headquarters, Chiang met with Chief of Staff Cao Haosen and others, giving instructions. He then took a ferry across the river to Hankou and went to Dazhimen Station, boarding the No. 1 private car. He departed north late at 11:00 PM. In addition to his entourage and guards, He Jingwu, the chairman of the Pinghan Railway Management Committee, also accompanied him on the train. (March 6th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>Appointed by the Central Government to Inspect Military Affairs</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Visits First for Secret Talks</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping states: He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, and Huang Shaoxiong, the Minister of Internal Affairs, departed from Nanjing on the 202nd Pingpu Express train with an attached private car at 7:00 PM on the 3rd to assist Zhang Xueliang in overseeing military affairs. He and Huang passed through Tianjin at 8:25 AM on the 5th. Yu Xueliang, the Chairman of Hebei Province, and Zhou Longguang, the Mayor of Tianjin, boarded the train to welcome them. Yu reported on the situation at the front and the defenses of Hebei Province for an hour before disembarking. At that time, He told reporters, "I have come here on the orders of the Central Government to inspect military affairs. I cannot predict how long I will stay in Beiping. I was surprised to hear the news of the fall of Chengde on the way. Our army has over 100,000 troops in Jehol. If the generals have the determination to die, they can gather and counterattack." The reporters expressed to He that the people of the North hoped that the Central Government would take a proactive attitude and take military responsibility. He replied that the Central Government had long been determined and had always taken active responsibility for military affairs, but the strategy could not be clearly stated. He had recently been in Shanghai for medical treatment and to coordinate the suppression of the Communist army in Fujian, and was not very clear about the Central Government's handling of matters in the North. This time, he was ordered to come north and will discuss strategies with all parties in Beiping. He advocated severely punishing generals who retreated without fighting. When asked if President Song would still come to Beiping, he replied that he had not heard anything about it before leaving. If needed, he would of course come. Regarding Feng Yuxiang's entry into Beijing, He also said that he had not heard of it, but he believed that Feng should enter Beijing. It was rumored that Feng had submitted a report to the Central Government, but He had asked Huang Shaogu, who said that there was no such thing. In a casual conversation, the issue of traitors spying for the enemy was mentioned. Many unreleased news in the North appeared in enemy newspapers, but there was no such problem in the South, especially in the capital. Japanese reporters had disappeared, and some patriotic youths voluntarily monitored the work of traitors. Once discovered, they would be severely punished. The rumor that the enemy had bribed the staff of the General Staff Department to steal wastepaper baskets from the office was untrue.</p>
<p>The train left for Beiping at 9:40 AM. In Beiping, starting from the morning of the 5th, the Military Council, the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau dispatched two platoons of guards, one team of security guards, and military police and a band to provide security and welcome them at the station. Wang Shuchang, Zhou Dawen, Jiang Bocheng, Yang Jie, Rong Zhen, Bao Yulin, and others also went to welcome them. It was not until 12:45 PM that they arrived at the East Station. After the train stopped, Jiang Bocheng and others boarded the train, exchanged greetings with He and Huang, and then got off the train together. He and Huang immediately took a car to Jurentang in Zhonghai to rest. Zhang Xueliang, the chairman of the Military Council, and Fu Zuoyi and others visited at 1:30 PM to discuss the course of the war in Jehol for about 20 minutes. Zhang then returned to Shuncheng Wangfu and decided to host a banquet at Shuncheng Wangfu at 8:00 PM that evening to discuss the Jehol issue. Those who came with He included Wang Lun, the chief of the First Bureau of the General Staff Department, Chen Chuxiong, the director of the secretariat of the Ministry of Military Administration, Lin Zhiqi, the secretary, and more than 20 staff members, including staff officers, adjutants, and telegraph operators. There were also more than 30 guards, all of whom were in Jurentang. According to sources, He will be stationed in Beiping for a long time and will organize a military command organization.</p>
<p>During the train stop in Fengtai, He also told reporters about the mission of his visit to the north. He said, "I came to Beiping once in the second year of the Xuantong reign (1910) and have not been here since. It has been about 20 years. This time, I came to inspect because the situation in the North is serious, and to discuss the issue of resisting Japan with Chairman Zhang and others. This morning, when passing through Tianjin, I learned that the war at the front was urgent. Chairman Yu (Xuezhong) also reported briefly, but the details are not very clear. Whether I will go to the front for inspection will be determined after meeting with the military officials in charge." He heard that the Japanese were trying to force our army to within the Great Wall. How to deal with it afterwards is still being planned.</p>
<p>After He finished speaking, he inquired in detail about the war situation in various parts of Jehol and the local situation in Beiping. According to Huang Shaoxiong, his trip was also exploratory in nature, and there was no other important task. The time of his return to Nanjing has not yet been determined. (6th)</p>

<p>Punish Them With Canonical Punishment to Appease the National People's Indignation</p>
<p>(Proposal by Liu Eqing et al.) The original proposal by six supervisory committee members including Liu Eqing to impeach Zhang Xueliang, the Chairman of the North China Military Commission Branch, and Tang Yulin, the Chairman of the Jehol Provincial Government, for failing to resist Japan, losing territory, and misleading the country states: "Zhang Xueliang, as the former local official of the Northeast before the September 18th Incident, lost Shenyang, Jinzhou, and other places due to non-resistance, and has already been impeached by this Yuan. This time, when the violent Japanese invaded Jehol, our Central Government secretly ordered resistance and charged Zhang Xueliang with military responsibility for North China. The supplies for the anti-Japanese war were also handed over to Zhang for distribution. At the beginning of receiving the order, Zhang sent troops and generals, but he had no determination to resist. This can be seen from the distribution of military supplies. After the start of the war, his main force retreated more than 600 li in less than ten days, which further proves it. It is found that those who participated in the defense of Jehol included about 40,000 troops under Tang Yulin, about 30,000 troops directly under Zhang, and about 30,000 troops under Sun Dianying, totaling more than 100,000 troops. At that time, we had already known about the Japanese invaders' preparations to attack Jehol. In terms of military relations, in addition to strictly guarding the East, the importance of Jehol's defense need not be said. Zhang has received more than 3 million yuan in Central Government military expenses and more than 5 million rounds of ammunition. He should have distributed and fully subsidized the troops participating in the defense of Jehol fairly, which would have been beneficial. However, according to the committee members, Zhang only gave Sun Dianying's troops 30,000 yuan for departure expenses and 300,000 rounds of ammunition, while the defense line assumed by Sun's troops was Chifeng in the north, which was far from the rear and difficult to continue supplying. Zhang only gave this amount, which is simply child's play. It is also found that the most forward defense positions in this Jehol defense were Kailu in the north, Chaoyang in the south, Chifeng in the north, Lingyuan in the south, Jianping in the middle, and Pingquan and Chengde again. Those who defended Kailu were Cui's brigade of the Jehol army, those who defended Chaoyang were Dong's brigade of the Jehol army, and those who defended Chifeng were Sun Dianying's troops. The main forces of Zhang and Tang were responsible for defense in other places. From the official contact with the Japanese invaders on the 25th of last month to the 4th of this month, Chengde fell. The only place not lost was Chifeng, defended by Sun's troops with insufficient food and ammunition. It is found that Kailu is more than 500 li from Chifeng, Chaoyang is about 300 li from Lingyuan, and Lingyuan is also 300 li from Chengde. The war had only started for three days, and Cui's brigade had retreated to the vicinity of Chifeng, and Dong's brigade had retreated to the vicinity of Lingyuan. Sun, with his isolated army, was affected by the retreat of Cui's brigade and the defection of the volunteer army Feng Zhanhai and Liu Guitang, but was still able to resist and hold firm until Chengde was lost and did not retreat. Zhang and Tang's main forces defended the natural barriers of Jianping and Lingyuan, but abandoned them in less than three days. In another three days, Pingquan and Chengde also fell. No matter how rapidly the Japanese invaders attacked, if Zhang and Tang's troops were willing to resist, they would never have lost 600 li of defense territory in less than ten days. Moreover, Zhang Xueliang was fully responsible for military affairs in North China, and Tang Yulin was the chairman of Jehol and the commander-in-chief of the group army. Since the start of the war, neither of them has personally visited the front line, and their lack of determination to resist can be seen. In the Battle of Shanghai, the 19th Route Army was able to hold on for dozens of days. Zhang and Tang relied on natural barriers and held heavy troops, and should have worked hard and sacrificed everything to go to the front. Now it is like this. Is Zhang and Tang's flesh enough to eat? Therefore, this proposal for impeachment should be forwarded to the Central Government to punish Zhang Xueliang and Tang Yulin according to national law as a warning to those who fail to defend their territory. Respectfully presented to the Dean, Committee Members Liu Eqing, Zhou Lisheng, Gao Yihan, Tian Jiongjin, Liu San, Wang Pingzheng, March 7th."</p>
<p>(Review Report) The original report of the Supervisory Committee members Yu Hongqi et al. states: "Regarding the presentation of the case, Liu Eqing and six other committee members impeached Zhang Xueliang, the Chairman of the Military Commission Branch, and Tang Yulin, the Chairman of Jehol, for losing national territory and failing to resist the enemy, losing territory and misleading the country. The committee members believe that Zhang Xueliang and Tang Yulin have already lost three provinces and abandoned Jehol. Their loss of power and humiliation of the country are obvious facts. If they are not severely dismissed and punished, how can we encourage the soldiers and save the crisis? Zhang Xueliang and Tang Yulin should be transferred to disciplinary action. Respectfully presented to the Dean, Yu Hongqi, Li Menggeng, Yao Yuping."</p>
<p>(Proposal by Gao Youtang et al.) Three Supervisory Committee members including Gao Youtang impeach Zhang Xueliang and Tang Yulin</p>
<p>The original text states: "Regarding the proposal, the credibility of the country is primarily based on discipline, and the duty of border officials is to defend the territory. Looking at historical records, in all past wars, those with strict military discipline have always been victorious, and those who have been lenient and tolerant have always been defeated. Like a shadow follows its form, like an echo responds to a sound. There is no need to discuss distant events. Looking at the history of the Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties, when Liang Fangping, the Song Jiedushi, lost Liyang, and the Jin people crossed the river, he was immediately executed during the Jingkang period. When Yang Yidiao, the Ming Metropolitan Yushi, lost Fengyang, and the roving bandits fled south, Chongzhen immediately executed him in the market. In addition, there were 36 people, including Chen Zubao, the governor, and Wu Guodong, the commander-in-chief, who were executed in one day for losing their borders. Descending to the former Qing Dynasty, He Guiqing was executed for losing Nanjing, and Qingmi was executed for losing Wuchang. During the Opium War, Qiying was ordered to commit suicide for losing Dagu. During the Sino-French War, Tang Jiong and Xu Yanxu were arrested for losing the Guangxi border. During the Sino-Japanese War, Wei Rugui was beheaded for losing Pyongyang, and Ye Zhichao and Gong Zhaoyu were permanently imprisoned for losing Lushun. All of these are countable. There has never been a case where someone has lost battles and territory again and again, and the government has not punished them, and the person involved is shamelessly unashamed, like Zhang Xueliang today. Zhang Xueliang was formerly the Deputy Commander and concurrently the Border Defense Commander, and later the Pacification Director and concurrently the Acting Chairman of the Military Council, commanding five provinces with an army of more than 300,000, and spending as much as 40 to 50 million yuan per year. And the Northeast Navy, aviation, and armory are not included. His position was not low, his spending was not small, his army was not numerous, and his equipment was not sophisticated. Yet, during the September 18th Incident, the Japanese launched an attack, and Liaoning was lost in a short time, followed by Jilin and Heilongjiang. According to what Youtang and others have heard, when the Japanese army shelled the Beidaying, Rong Zhen, the Chief of Staff, made four phone calls from Shenyang to request instructions on how to deal with the situation. Zhang Xueliang was watching a play at the Zhonghe Theater until the end of the play and returned to his residence. Shenyang had already fallen. Zhang Xueliang, in order to cover up, euphemistically called it taking a non-resistance policy, which is rare in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. The word non-resistance can be said to be the newest term in the military dictionary and the newest strategy in the national military academy. For two years, the blame from society and the attacks from newspapers have been heard every day. The government has been accommodating and has not asked for blame. Commentators say that the government hopes that he will atone for his sins and make meritorious service, and cautiously observe the aftermath. Recently, Yuguan has fallen and Jehol has been completely lost. Where is the so-called meritorious service? What is the so-called aftermath? Even with the tongue of Qin Yi, there is no way to argue for him. Assuming that after the September 18th Incident, Zhang Xueliang had a little humanity, worked hard to revitalize, slept on firewood and tasted gall, and planned strategies, it was not impossible to recover the lost territory and atone for his past sins. But unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang occupied Beiping, indulging in debauchery, singing and dancing constantly. Military salaries have not been paid for months, and soldiers cannot get enough to eat all day long and still have no cotton clothes in the severe winter. This is really not enough to wash away his filth with the water of the West River, and not enough to exhaust his sins with the bamboo of Nanshan. Recently, when Jehol was in danger, Zhang Xueliang used the opportunity to blackmail the Central Government for salaries. Since the start of the war, he has fabricated military reports and exaggerated victories. Beipiao, Nanling, Chaoyang, and Chengde were lost one after another in less than ten days. It is not enough to die ten thousand times to atone for the crime of giving away the three northeastern provinces, and it is even more difficult to justify his guilt when he uses Jehol to help the enemy. Therefore, this impeachment is proposed in accordance with the law. It is proposed that the government make an emergency decision and immediately execute Zhang Xueliang according to the law, and strictly arrest Tang Yulin and punish them together, in order to maintain military discipline and encourage the army. Youtang and others also have something to say: When using troops, it is necessary to first establish military prestige, and when fighting, it is especially important to arouse the morale of the soldiers. There are constant punishments for losing battles and territory. Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, went to Hubei and Jiangxi to suppress bandits and had strict orders to execute officers who lost cities, so that the soldiers and generals obeyed orders and were able to achieve success. Zhang Xueliang lost territory as wide as four provinces, and there is no doubt that he should be sentenced to death. If the government continues to ignore it, it seems that military law is only applied to the lower ranks, while the Pacification Director and concurrently the Acting Chairman of the Military Council are on the list of discussing relatives and discussing nobility, which I am afraid is not what a republican country should do. Moreover, since Jehol has fallen and North China is shaken, the generals believe that since Zhang Xueliang is still at large, losing battles and territory is of no great importance, and they will certainly flee in panic, which is a danger that Youtang and others cannot bear to say. All of this is caused by the leniency towards Zhang Xueliang. It is necessary for the government to make a decisive decision and implement it quickly, boosting the morale of the armies at the front, comforting the indignation of the people of the country, recovering the lost territories, and shifting the attention of the powers. All of this can be accomplished in one fell swoop. The Northeast is fortunate, and the country is fortunate. Respectfully presented to the Dean, Supervisory Committee Members Gao Youtang, Li Luogeng, Shao Hongji, March 7th."</p>
<p>(Review Report) The original report of the Supervisory Committee members Gao Yihe et al. states: "Regarding the review report, the committee members have already impeached Zhang Xueliang for losing the three northeastern provinces last summer in accordance with the law, and are waiting for the Central Government to punish him. Now Jehol has been lost again. What does the so-called acting chairman of the Military Council do? The committee members believe that the circumstances are serious and the incident is extraordinary. We should ask the Dean to invoke the emergency relief provisions and specially request the Central Government to immediately and clearly punish Zhang Xueliang and Tang Yulin, in order to encourage the people's hearts and save the crisis. The report is hereby submitted as above. Committee Members Liu San, Gao Yihan, Zhou Lisheng."</p>

<h3>Local Gentlemen Donate Land for Park Construction</h3>
<p>The land near Nijiatan, south of Malu Bridge in this city, was previously purchased from the Shatine Bureau by Yin Shisheng and Zhang Jiecai. They planned to use the land as a park for the public benefit. Later, Yin and others learned that the land had been filed with the county government in the past year by local gentlemen of Songjiang to build a memorial pavilion for the American missionary Mr. Bu Huilian, and they also planned to develop a park in the future. Therefore, the gentlemen believed that it was the same as making it public to society, and immediately donated the land to the association to contribute to the early construction of the park.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the Case of Stealing and Selling Kerosene</h3>
<p>Xue Youhua from Shanghai, who contracted with the Asia Petroleum Company last year, hired boats from Yu Kangxiang and Han Changfa to transport 202 large barrels of kerosene, stating that they would be transported to the Zenghua distribution office in Huzhou for delivery. The Yu et al. transported them to Huangdu in the county, stole and sold them to Feng Ziyu in the town, falsely reporting that they were robbed by bandits in order to get rid of the assets. Feng ordered Chen Dexing to transport the goods to Lu Zixuan's yard in Lujia Lane. Chen then colluded with Jiang Meisong to peddle them in the city, selling 81 barrels. After Xue received the news of the robbery, he investigated in many ways and seized the original stolen goods, and filed a complaint with the county government, including Feng Yongbin's purchase of stolen goods. Chen Dexing also counter-sued Xue Youhua, Feng Ziyu, and Wu Buwen, the former district chief of Huangdu, Zhang Yishan, the deputy commander of the security regiment, and Chen Youtang, Fan Yiri, and Yao Shumei from Shanghai for colluding to defraud and take property. The case was complicated and caused a sensation in society. The county government separately detained a group of witnesses for interrogation for many years. Now, it is ruled that Yu Kangxiang and Han Changfa jointly embezzled the items held in their business, and Yu is sentenced to three years of imprisonment and the trial is sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Chen Dexing and Jiang Meisong jointly purchased stolen goods, Chen is sentenced to two years of imprisonment, and Jiang is sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Lu Zixuan and Feng Yongbin are both innocent, and Feng Ziyu is at large and the trial is suspended. The remaining 109 large barrels of kerosene, 10 barrels of vehicle oil, 2 barrels of yellow fat oil, and 81 pairs of empty barrels shall be returned to Xue Youhua. Yu, Chen, Han, Jiang, Feng, and other five people shall jointly compensate Xue Youhua for a loss of 2,349 yuan. Yang Dexing's counter-suit is dismissed due to improper procedures.</p>
<h3>Land Survey and Measurement Officially Begins</h3>
<p>The county government has established a land bureau to prepare for the survey and measurement of land. Funds have long been collected, trainees have been selected and sent for training, and the provincial land bureau sent personnel to Jiaxing last winter to measure the map roots. The root map survey has now exceeded half of the county's border. Zhu Yunxiang and other eleven survey and measurement trainees who were sent to the province for training have returned to the county upon completion of their term. The provincial land bureau ordered Peng Yumo to be the captain of the land survey and measurement team in this county, and Chen Chaohai and Xu Minghe to be team members. They led a team of more than ten people to Jiaxing, and established a land survey and measurement office in the Tang family to begin the land survey and measurement in the five townships and towns of Loutang, Gusong, Jinglong, Yongqing, and Chaoan in the northern border's Fifth District.</p>
<p>Suzhou Establishes a Tap Water Company</p>
<p>Zhang Peng and others in this city, noting that the rivers in Suzhou city are narrow and shallow, and that residents rely entirely on wells for drinking water during major droughts, which is detrimental to hygiene and is also related to fire control, initiated the establishment of the Suzhou City Tap Water Company, with a planned capital of 300,000 yuan. They have already raised 100,000 yuan in Shanghai, and are still short of 200,000 yuan, which they hope to raise in Suzhou. The plan is to set up a water tower outside Xumen and bury the main water pipes in Yangyu Lane, Jingde Road, and Guanqian Street, with small water pipes branching out in other places. Once preparations are completed, they will immediately apply to the authorities for filing. There are also overseas Chinese Xu Liangcheng and others who plan to raise 1.6 million yuan to establish a large-scale tap water company. They have sent Gong Zhenfang to Suzhou to negotiate with all parties, and may cooperate with Zhang Peng to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Appeal Verdict in the Case of Lei Renlong's Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>The case of Lei Renlong, the president of the Wujin County Court, appealing against the charges of embezzlement and dereliction of duty, has been repeatedly investigated by the third criminal court of the High Court, presided over by Song Yuan. The verdict was announced at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 8th). Lei, who was released on bail, did not attend. The main text of the verdict is: the original judgment on the crime of embezzlement is revoked, and the crimes of dereliction of duty and fraud are merged and sentenced to imprisonment for one year and eight months, and a fine of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Rural Economic Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Farmland Untended</p>
<p>In this city, the silkworm industry has failed for many years, the crops have failed, and the rural economy has collapsed beyond repair. As the spring plowing is approaching, according to the situation in previous years, farmers will go out to find farmland to cultivate, hoping to make a living for the year. However, this year's situation is completely different from the past. Good farmland is untended, and the price of ash fertilizer has plummeted. There are two reasons for the decline: (1) The rural economy is bankrupt, and there is no food for three days. Young men have gone out to earn a living. (2) It is difficult to make ends meet, so there is no surplus to fertilize. Therefore, the fertile farmland that was previously regarded as a rare commodity has now become unattended. The rural economy has now entered the most serious period. It is hoped that those who care about the rural economy will rise up and find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>Tongnan Confiscates Beaches</p>
<p>The provincial government's financial department has found that Xu Xuexian has built beaches by plotting sea sand in Nantong, exceeding the originally reported amount by 1,500 mu. It has specially decided to confiscate them and value them at 60 yuan per mu. The Nantong Education Bureau will take over the beaches, and the income will be returned to the national treasury. The county government has been ordered to implement the case. County Magistrate Zhang arrested Xu on the evening of the 6th and ordered him to hand over the land.</p>

<h3>Telegrams from Various Public Organizations Requesting Severe Punishment for Zhang Xueliang and Others</h3>
<p>Losing Territory Before Losing Troops is an Unforgivable Crime</p>
<p>If the Country Had Standard Laws, All Would Be Full of Vigor</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Local Associations, due to the fall of Rehe and the tension in North China, convened a joint meeting of various public organizations the evening before last to discuss countermeasures in detail. It was resolved: 1) To request the government to promptly dispatch heavy troops to guard the strategic passes of Duolun and Zhangjiakou to prevent the enemy from advancing into Chahar. Mr. Xiong Bingsan was requested to take this resolution to Beiping and present it to Chairman Chiang in person. 2) To jointly telegraph the central government, requesting that Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Tang Yulin, etc., be severely punished according to military law. The telegram was drafted by Huang Renzhi and Yan E'sheng and was sent out yesterday. The text of the telegram is recorded below: To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Military Affairs Commission Xinxiang Headquarters: The violent Japanese have declared their intention to invade Rehe and advance into North China for several months. The people of the whole country are running around in anger and indignation. Those with wealth are willing to destroy their homes, and those with strength are willing to donate their lives. The allied countries have voiced their support with righteousness, almost unanimously. At this moment when all eyes are watching and foreign countries are looking forward, the news suddenly came that the entire front line of Rehe had collapsed. For several days, the documents and telegrams have been full of confusing reports. Since the fall of Kailu and Chaoyang, Lingnan, Lingyuan, Jianping, and Chifeng have become the front line, with Pingquan as the rear, and Chengde further behind. There are towering mountains and ridges between them, each separated by hundreds of miles. On the evening of the third, there were no enemy soldiers in Chengde, but the foreign news agencies on the fourth noisily reported that our troops in Chengde, Pingquan, Lingnan, and Lingyuan were retreating to Gubeikou, Xifengkou, and Lengkou. Chengde is the provincial capital where Tang Yulin is stationed, and Pingquan, Lingyuan, and Lingnan to the east are all heavily garrisoned by Zhang Xueliang and Wan Fulin. At that time, Sun Dianying's brigade in Chifeng was still fighting hard, but the main force line, both front and rear, suddenly withdrew completely. Even a defeat could not be so rapid. The enemy came from the east, so the retreat should have been from east to west, but now both the front and rear retreated simultaneously from north to south. What is the reason for this? Although the war reports have been trying to cover up in many ways, how can they completely conceal the eyes and ears of the world? Even if we take a step back and say that it was indeed a defeat, we must ask what is the use of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, and what was the purpose of months of preparation? As for Zhang Zuoxiang, who held the position of commander-in-chief, delaying his arrival in Rehe, what is the reason for that? Since September 18th, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang were lost due to non-resistance, Jinzhou was lost due to the withdrawal of troops, and the Shanhaiguan and Jiugmenkou were lost in small battles one after another. Now, in just one or two days, the entire Rehe province has been lost seemingly intentionally or unintentionally. There are natural barriers that can be defended but are not defended, there is morale that can be used but is not used, and there is hard-won assistance from friendly nations, but they rashly expose their incompetence. What face do Zhang Xueliang and his like have to face the people of the country, and what face does our country have to face the world? If a country has no laws, how can it achieve peace and order? If an army has no laws, how can it punish defeat? The past evasiveness and forbearance have led to today's situation. If we continue to be evasive and forbearing, then Chahar will be lost, then North China will be lost, then South China will be lost. Although China's territory is vast, how many defeats and losses can it withstand? We should request the government to immediately punish Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Tang Yulin, and others according to military law. At the same time, reorganize the various armies, guard the various passes, and order the various armies at the front line to counterattack uniformly, allowing them to redeem themselves through meritorious service, and not allowing them to retreat into the pass. Zhangjiakou and Duolun are particularly important in terms of transportation and should be defended by heavy troops to prevent the enemy from fleeing west. If Zhang Xueliang and his like have any conscience, they should request severe punishment to apologize to the world. Our people and the government must know that the loss of Rehe is not due to the soldiers' unwillingness to fight, nor is it due to the general officers' lack of courage to fight. The blame lies solely with the senior generals who bear the full responsibility for command. On the one hand, we deeply hate the unforgivable crime of losing territory before losing troops. On the other hand, we should remember that the soldiers are of one mind and the military and civilians are united, so there is still hope for action. If the country has standard laws, then the soldiers will be full of vigor. Our people should still work together to try to remedy the situation, even if it is only a slight improvement. If we continue to be evasive and forbearing, I am afraid that the people's anger will be aroused and future troubles will be prolonged, which is something that public organizations cannot tolerate. According to reports, Chairman Chiang is traveling north, and the public organizations have collectively decided to make an urgent appeal, hoping that it will be considered and adopted. The National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Associations, the Northeast Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association, the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association, the Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Northeast Compatriots, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, the Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, the Nanjing Road Business Community Federation, and the First District Branch of the Shanghai Special District Citizen Federation kowtow together.

<h3>Municipal Executive Committee Telegraphs Request for Severe Punishment of Zhang and Tang</h3>
<p>Also Telegraphs Blame to Zhang Xueliang</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters believes that Tang Yulin, Chairman of the Rehe Provincial Government, was greedy and derelict in his duties, leading to the fall of Rehe in less than ten days. Zhang Xueliang's poor command and delay in national affairs are also unforgivable. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed the Central National Government to severely punish them to uphold national law. At the same time, they also telegraphed blame to Zhang Xueliang. The original telegram is recorded below: 1) To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee and the National Government: Since the violent Japanese invaded, the Northeast has fallen, and their ambition to encroach and annex has not ended. Judging by their intentions, they not only want to occupy our land but also want to destroy our nation. The entire country, from top to bottom, is aware of the danger of a collapsing nest and is planning for self-defense. We strictly demand that the soldiers at the front line fulfill their duty to defend the territory and make a heroic vow to resist to the death. However, the alarming news has come that Rehe, known as a natural fortress, has fallen completely in less than ten days. Provincial Chairman Tang Yulin is greedy and derelict in his duties, not knowing what his duties are. He abandoned Chengde and fled before the battle, violating laws and discipline to the extreme. We should request that he be dismissed and investigated to uphold national law. Zhang Xueliang, the chief of the Northeast, is not capable enough to be competent and not wise enough to foresee. He did not prepare for war in peacetime and failed to command properly in times of crisis, treating national affairs like a child's play and delaying the overall situation. We also request that he be punished together to maintain order and show a warning. We respectfully request your consideration. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee, Geng Yin. 2) To Comrade Zhang Hanqing in Beiping: The three provinces have fallen, and not an inch of land has been recovered. The natural fortress of Rehe was lost in a few days. The former could still be excused as a diplomatic solution, but what excuse can be used for the latter? With the vast territory of the Northeast, the many mountains and rivers, the different advantages of offense and defense, and the different situations of labor and leisure, even if we cannot wipe out the enemy, we should not allow them to enter our homes and slaughter us at will. Rehe Chairman Tang Yulin was greedy and fled before the battle. He should have been transferred to another place and replaced with a virtuous official to take charge of this important place. Instead, you trusted this mediocre and villainous person and entrusted him with the important task of guarding the heartland. Your actions were inappropriate, and your command was poor. Tang's crime is unpardonable, but can you, comrade, be free from blame? Today's matter, the problem still lies with the four northeastern provinces, not with Beiping and Tianjin. If the Northeast can be recovered, then Beiping and Tianjin will be protected without having to defend them. Please do not be complacent about retreating to protect Beiping and Tianjin, and allow the four northeastern provinces to be lost forever. We hope that you will lead your troops, go out of the pass to kill the enemy, recover the lost territory, and strengthen the barrier of our Central Plains. Avoid affecting diplomacy due to military setbacks, so that the merits and demerits can be offset, and you can still make up for it later. The opportunity is urgent and fleeting. We specially telegraph to encourage you, waiting for good news. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee, Geng Yin.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing's Telegram</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiqing sent a telegram from the front line yesterday to a certain gentleman in this city. The original text is as follows: I have received your telegram. Our army was organized to fight for the survival of the nation, and we should fight for the survival of the nation. No matter how dangerous the environment, how weak the forces, or how exhausted the supplies, we will face it with a spirit of great fearlessness. Therefore, since the loss of eastern Rehe, our army has been trapped in a situation of encirclement on three sides. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers can encourage themselves and have managed to keep this piece of clean land in Rehe, which is somewhat comforting to the people of the country. As for the danger of fighting alone, it has long been considered by our army colleagues. Strategically speaking, retreat is inevitable. However, because the people here are willing to live and die with our army, if we abandon them and leave, they will either surrender to the Japanese or be slaughtered by the Japanese. Not only will we have no way to face the patriotic people, but we will also bring shame to the nation. In the future, all the people of the Northeast will be willing to give their lives for the country. Please tell the people of the country that as long as our army has one soldier left, we will never abandon the defensive position we are currently holding. However, in the area north of the pass, there are still newly established units of our army headquarters, which are planning to concentrate and go to the front. Unexpectedly, Rehe was lost in less than ten days, and transportation was cut off. Being isolated from the front, there is a concern that they may disintegrate. We sincerely hope that the people of the country can provide sufficient spiritual and material assistance to this unit and vigorously cultivate this emerging anti-Japanese force. Even if our entire army is annihilated in the frontier, we would be willing. The reason why the enemy was able to defeat our 200,000+ troops with only a few thousand soldiers is threefold: 1) Tang, the ruler of Rehe for several years, violently plundered and levied taxes, causing widespread resentment. The ignorant people took the opportunity to retaliate and were willing to act as accomplices for the enemy, and there were quite a few. 2) In peacetime, the army did not receive pay, and in wartime, the generals did not lead the battle. The soldiers had no fighting spirit. Being confused by the enemy's deception, they collapsed at the sight of the enemy, and some even turned their guns against us. Shao Benliang's actions in Chaoyang are a current example. 3) The various armies resisting the enemy fought independently, and coordination was lacking, giving the enemy an opportunity to defeat them one by one. Moreover, they only defended and did not attack, not knowing that attack is the best defense. They only planned to resist and did not plan to attack, resulting in a decline in morale and a collapse in battle. Based on past failures, if we do not promote the national spirit and turn defense into offense, it will not be enough to boost morale and defeat the strong enemy. What should be particularly noted is that the people of the Northeast are brave and good at fighting, and civilian guns are everywhere. If we can make good use of them, they will be enough to contain the enemy army everywhere, making it difficult for them to drive straight in. Otherwise, they will be used by the enemy to guide them and drive them to attack us, which will be unfavorable to us everywhere. (The following is omitted) Jiqing Geng</p>
<h3>Feng Zhanhai's Representatives Zhao Zhuohua and Luo Xiyuan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the fall of Rehe, the whole country was in grief and indignation. General Feng Zhanhai specially sent staff officer Zhao Zhuohua and secretary Luo Xiyuan to Shanghai to report on the anti-Japanese process and the situation of the fall. Zhao and Luo arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Talks About the Merger of the Two Aviation Associations Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>The Aviation Association Will Increase the Number of Directors</p>
<p>Wang Zhengyan's Entire Family Joins as Members</p>
<p>The aviation salvation movement has become increasingly important as the Japanese bandits have used their powerful air force to invade Rehe and continue to bomb the various passes of the Great Wall. The people of the country are learning from the past and so are more enthusiastically participating in subsidizing the government and building a powerful air force. Therefore, the work of the China Aviation Association is also becoming increasingly tense, and the merger with the Aviation Construction Association can be realized in a short time in this tense atmosphere. Here are some related news:</p>
<p>(Merger of the Two Associations) The issue of the Aviation Construction Association merging into the China Aviation Association has become inevitable since the Ministry of Transportation revoked the registration of the Construction Association. However, the procedures for the merger have not been discussed. Recently, Xiong Xiling came to Shanghai from Beiping. Because Mr. Xiong is a director of both aviation associations, he and Mr. Lin Kanghou will be responsible for contacting the two associations to handle the merger procedures. The negotiations are currently underway and should be resolved before Mr. Xiong returns to the north.</p>
<p>(Management of Funds) The 23-member Fund Management Committee of the Aviation Association, after passing the regulations last week, has asked Secretary Lin Wojang to draft all management regulations and meeting rules. The draft management regulations, consisting of ten articles, have now been completed. It is recommended to appoint seven to nine standing committee members to establish a standing committee to avoid difficulties in convening members scattered in various places and hindering the progress of the association's affairs. The standing committee also stipulates that there should be at least two government committee members. The association will convene its first meeting soon to pass the regulations, appoint standing committee members, and begin operations.</p>
<p>(Entire Family Joins) Mr. Wang Rutang, a standing director of the association, introduced his entire family, including male and female servants, to join the association yesterday. Eight family members, including Mrs. Wang and her wife, became special members, four became ordinary members, and fourteen chauffeurs, cooks, male and female servants also joined as ordinary members, becoming the first in the city to have their entire family join.</p>
<p>(School Lectures) The Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' School, because the students are very enthusiastic about the aviation movement, sent a representative to the association the day before yesterday to invite Mr. Lin Wojang to give a lecture at the school at 11:00 am tomorrow (Thursday). Mr. Lin agreed to their request. Several other schools, such as the McTyeire School, have also made similar requests.</p>
<p>(Tianchu Donates Aircraft) Since donating an aircraft, Tianchu Flavoring Factory has begun to contact the manufacturer for purchase. However, the factory has always focused on practical work and is unwilling to publicize too much, so little is known about the progress. It is now learned that the negotiations have already made progress and are waiting for the competent authority to select the aircraft model. Once approved, it will be purchased immediately and should arrive in Shanghai in about one to two months.</p>
<p>(Muslim Meeting) The Muslims of this city sent a letter to the Aviation Association yesterday, stating that the Muslims of Shanghai, in view of the deepening national crisis and the urgency of the situation, believe that everyone is responsible for saving the nation. Therefore, on March 5, they convened a meeting at the China Islamic Society to discuss the fundraising for aviation salvation. The attendees unanimously decided to actively organize a fundraising team and elected Mr. Ma Shaozhen to join your association as the team leader. Please appoint him. After receiving the letter, the Aviation Association has issued an appointment letter and appointed Mr. Ma Shaozhen as the team leader. It is also heard that the Muslims have also raised funds to purchase the "Anderxin" aircraft.</p>
<p>(Sugar Industry Declaration) Zheng Zenan, chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, has been actively seeking the eighth team leader for the China Aviation Association and soliciting members. Recently, he issued a solemn declaration to the members of the industry, stating, "The enemy is deep, and the matter is urgent. Rehe has fallen, and Tianjin and Beiping are shaken. The collapse of our divine land is imminent, and the landscape will change color soon. Under a collapsed nest, there are no intact eggs. The people of a fallen country are slaves. Do not say that the knife has not been put to your neck, and allow yourself to sit idly by. You must know that the rope is already on your eyebrows, how can you still have hope? Aviation salvation is imminent. Quickly join the Aviation Association as a member, strengthen the aviation power, and fight to the death with the enemy. Turn back the tide and save the country from the brink of collapse. The national lifeline and the lives of the people all depend on this. Wake up, wake up quickly, come quickly."</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation is Cultivating Aviation Talents for Our Country</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Beiping Route Resumes Flights</p>
<p>Sky Tours Have Been Implemented</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping route has resumed yesterday, with three flights per week. It is also cultivating aviation talents for our country, and sky tours have been implemented yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Route Resumes Flights</h3>
<p>The company's Shanghai-Beiping route, when it was launched in January of this year, originally stipulated three round trips per week to facilitate rapid mail delivery. Later, due to a shortage of pilots, it was temporarily changed to two round trips per week, which has been quite inconvenient since its implementation. Now the company has newly hired pilots who have been trained, so yesterday it resumed three flights per week, re-stipulating that Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays are the days for flights from Shanghai to Beiping, and Wednesdays and Fridays are the days for flights from Beiping to Shanghai. Yesterday was Wednesday, and the flight from Beiping took off at 7:00 am, with one passenger and more than 20 kilograms of mail, arriving in Shanghai at 4:00 pm yesterday.</p>
<h3>Creating Talents and Practicing Driving</h3>
<p>In order to cultivate aviation technical talents for our country, the Ministry of Transportation recently instructed the company to hire qualified drivers as much as possible. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guomin News Agency visited the company's sales director. According to him, the company has now hired ten Chinese pilots who fly with the aircraft every day to practice driving. In the future, when their skills mature, foreign personnel will be gradually dismissed to avoid the criticism of relying on foreigners for too long. This can also promote China's aviation industry.</p>
<h3>Sky Tours Begin to Be Implemented</h3>
<p>Sky tours, which were naturally suspended last winter due to the cold weather, have not been tried by anyone since the arrival of spring. Yesterday morning, Yao Huixin, a musician from Wing On Company, and three other gentlemen went to book a plane for fifteen minutes at a price of fifty yuan. They took the tour at 2:00 pm. According to the company's sales director, this type of tour plane is completely safe. Each plane has two pilots who are very experienced. In this beautiful spring weather, it is a great idea to take a tour to relax and enjoy the scenery.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Returned to China and Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Disembarked This Morning</p>
<p>Jiang Zuobin, our country's ambassador to Japan, returned to China on leave with his family and others aboard the Dollar Steamship Company's President Cleveland, which left Japan for Shanghai. It entered the port at 11:00 pm last night and docked at the Dollar Wharf in Bailianjing at 12:00 am. Due to customs clearance procedures, they had to disembark at the new customs wharf at 8:30 am this morning. It is heard that Mr. Jiang will take the night train to Nanjing tonight to report everything to the central government.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Left Shanghai by Plane Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Destination Unknown</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, the acting President of the Executive Yuan, came to Shanghai a few days ago to inspect the various agencies under the Ministry of Finance and discuss financial matters. It is learned that Mr. Song took off from Hongqiao Airport in a Ford aircraft at 7:00 am yesterday and left Shanghai. According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing, he has not arrived in Nanjing. As for where he went, it was still unknown as of last night. It is possible that he went to Beiping, but this has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Xiong Xiling Returned to Beiping by Train Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Carrying Resolutions from Various Groups</p>
<p>Returned to Beiping to Present to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling came to Shanghai to contact the local associations regarding the issue of preparing to deal with the situation in North China. He has now finished his work and left Shanghai by the early train yesterday morning. When Mr. Xiong was leaving, he told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that he originally came to Shanghai to discuss long-term resistance plans. Now that Rehe has fallen, the people should work harder. Last night, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Northeast Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, and nine other groups held a joint meeting to discuss the future situation for a long time. They all believed that after Japan occupied Rehe, it would still want to invade Chahar and should ask the government to quickly dispatch heavy troops to guard the strategic passes of Duolun and Zhangjiakou. After the various groups discussed, they asked him to present the resolutions to Chairman Chiang when he returned to Beiping.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Rice Merchants' Strike</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Submits Request for Mediation</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Go to City Government to Petition</p>
<p>After the rice merchants went on strike to protest the Huke's implementation of heavy bushels, although the Party and government agencies tried to mediate, the situation was complicated and could not be resolved. The rice industry has petitioned the city government, requesting that the rice merchants be stopped from blocking rice boats. The City Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, asking for a quick resolution to the issue of heavy bushels, while the rice merchants also petitioned the city government. The dispute may not be over yet. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Submits Request for Mediation</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating, "We are submitting a request. On the 6th of this month, we received a letter from the Minhang Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai County, stating that since the rice bushel incident in Shanghai, rice boats from the interior have been stopped from sailing to Shanghai by the Lianyi Association. After a long time, the rice is inevitably stifled and steamed. Moreover, Shanghai merchants who come directly to Minhang to purchase rice are also obstructed and prohibited from sailing by the association members. If a quick solution is not sought, the people's food and the town's business in Shanghai will be greatly affected. We believe that your association leads and respects the merchants, and we hope that you will quickly seek a fair solution to maintain business and benefit transportation. After the meeting, we believe that this matter is currently being mediated by your bureau together with the Party headquarters, and we have summoned all parties to mediate. Due to the above two reasons, the matter concerns the people's food and business transportation. After a long time, there are many obstacles to all parties. We should report the situation and ask your bureau to examine and approve it, and quickly find a way to resolve it, so that rice transportation can be unimpeded as soon as possible, which is beneficial to the public."</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Petitioned Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>All the striking rice merchants organized a petition group of rice merchants from various gangs and elected Zhang Fusheng, Wu Fuhai, Jin Genda, Jin Weixiang, Lu Junwen, Ding Genhe, Wu Min, Lu Gongquan, and more than 500 other people as representatives. At 11:30 am yesterday, they carried a petition and went to the Fenglin Bridge City Government to petition. They then elected Lu Gongquan, Lu Junwen, Wu Min, and Jin Weixiang as general representatives to enter, while the other representatives waited on the open space next to the City Government Road. The City Government sent Zhang Shiwu, a staff member of the Second Section, to meet them. The four general representatives first stated their intentions, requesting that the City Government order the Social Affairs Bureau to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Zhang Shiwu then told the representatives that the City Government had instructed the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and instructed the four general representatives to inform all the rice merchants to start transporting first and wait for the Party and government agencies to mediate, so as not to affect the people's food in this city. The representatives were satisfied and left. The petition is recorded below. We are submitting a petition. We have repeatedly suffered from the exploitation of heavy bushels, which is already unspeakable. As a last resort, we stopped transporting to make a legitimate request. However, to this day, there is still no fair solution. Therefore, we have organized a petition group to request that the Mayor's Office adopt a flat bushel funnel and ban the Huke's surgery to relieve the merchants' plight and reveal fairness. Respectfully submitted by Wu, Mayor, and the representatives of the petition group of rice merchants from various gangs, Zhang Fusheng, Wu Fusheng, Wu Fuhai, Jin Genda, Jin Weixiang, Lu Junwen, Ding Genhe, Wu Min, Lu Gongquan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Passenger and Freight Combined Transport Increases Vehicle Speed</h3>
<p>Implemented Starting April 1</p>
<p>Direct Arrival Within 40 Hours</p>
<p>In order to facilitate direct transportation for the convenience of combined transportation on the Jinpu and Beijing-Shanghai Railways, the Ministry of Railways has ordered a Yangtze River train ferry between Pukou and Xiaguan from the United Kingdom. However, the ferry will have to wait until July or August of this year before it can be shipped to China for application. Now the Ministry of Railways will find ways to increase vehicle speed before the ferry is completed to facilitate passengers and freight. Now, the eight Mecca-style locomotives ordered by the Jinpu Railway Bureau from the United Kingdom have been shipped and are scheduled to be applied starting on April 1. It is heard that these new cars have exquisite parts and strong towing force. It originally took 36 hours from Pu to Ping, but it can be reduced to 27 hours. Therefore, the trip from Shanghai to Ping can be reached within 40 hours.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Temporarily Suspends Issuance of Foreign Tourist Visas to Rehe</h3>
<p>Wen Hongen, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, received instructions from the Municipal Government yesterday, which stated, "After investigating, Rehe Province has entered a military period and should not be on the list of tourist destinations. Now, in order to maintain the safety of foreigners and avoid dangers, we will temporarily suspend foreign tourism to show importance." Director Wen has ordered Hong Qiwen, the chief of the Second Section of the bureau, to notify the Foreign Affairs Section to temporarily suspend the issuance of foreign tourist visas to Rehe.</p>

<h3>Local Muslims Talk About the Conflict Between Hui and Han in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>The Province's Rich Deposits are the Richest in the Country</p>
<p>We Deeply Hope That Those in Power Will Take Measures to Develop It</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that there are reports of conflicts between the Hui and Han ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Those in the Hui community who have connections with the Northwest have no way to verify this news. However, according to business and postal personnel who returned to Shanghai from Xinjiang last year, they all believe that this news is factual because the local Muslims and the Han have accumulated animosity, especially dissatisfied with the actions of local officials. At the same time, the rulers of the province are all muddled and confused, not knowing how to take advantage of the situation. In March and April of last year, Muslims near Hami in the province had a conflict with the authorities over a minor matter. The government sent a large team to suppress it, but as a result, they were defeated by the strong Muslims there. After a long period of turmoil, it was finally resolved, but there are still small conflicts from time to time in other places. I think this time's serious conflict may still be a continuation of the previous unresolved disputes. (According to the report of the new chairman Jin Shuren this spring, there was a similar report.) It is also possible that the new province has a large area and a sparse population. The rich deposits are the richest in the country. If those in power can reconcile the feelings of the Hui and Han ethnic groups and engage in development and construction, there will never be long-term conflicts as in the past.</p>
<h3>City General Labor Union Requests Direct Election of National Labor Representatives</h3>
<p>The City General Labor Union stated that this year's International Labor Conference will be held in Geneva in May. According to the International Labour Organization Act, all labor representatives should be selected by labor organizations. Therefore, the union yesterday submitted separate requests to the Central People's Movement Committee and the Ministry of Industry, requesting approval. The original text reads: "Request for the International Labor Conference Labor Representatives to be selected by labor organizations, respectfully requesting review and approval. The 17th International Labor Conference will be held in Geneva in May this year. Our country's employer representative has already been nominated as Mr. Yan Qingxiang by industrial groups, but the labor representative has not yet been decided. The International Labor Conference is the only international labor organization and is of great importance to the nation. In past sessions, except for Yang Youren, the labor representative of the 15th session, the remaining labor representatives were all appointed by the central government's committee members, and were not true worker representatives. According to Article 389, Chapter 1 of the International Labour Organization Act, 'The Conference shall be composed of representatives of employers and workers of each member state,' which is the opposite of the actual situation. Therefore, the representatives appointed by the central government in the past have repeatedly encountered difficulties during qualification reviews. This not only concerns the dignity of the nation but also easily leads to contempt from foreigners. Moreover, since the unification of our Party, our country's labor organizations have become increasingly sound, and there is no shortage of knowledgeable and experienced people among the workers. Therefore, the labor representatives for this session should be directly elected by labor organizations, so as to enhance international status and promote the spirit of labor. Our union, as the general hub of the labor community, cannot remain silent, and therefore dares to submit this document to your Ministry (Committee), respectfully requesting review and approval for implementation, and eagerly awaits instructions."</p>
<h3>Jiang Guangnai Replies to Guangdong Fellow Association Telegram</h3>
<p>Currently Planning to Go North to Aid Rehe</p>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai previously telegraphed Chairman Jiang of Fujian to lead troops and expedite support to Rehe. Now, a reply telegram has been received stating: "To the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai, your telegram is acknowledged. The Japanese invaders' actions in Rehe are causing a national crisis, and the situation is extremely urgent. Public sentiment here is激昂 (jī áng, stirred up). We are currently planning to go north to aid Rehe. Thank you for your encouragement. We still hope for timely guidance. Jiang Guangnai bows."</p>
<h3>Central and Other Three Banks Jointly Form Two-Dollar Exchange Management Committee</h3>
<p>Decision to Establish Tomorrow</p>
<p>Office to Start Immediately</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has decided to implement the silver standard from tomorrow, with all business transactions calculated in silver dollars. Both the silver and money industries are prepared to comply. After implementation, the exchange of taels for yuan and yuan for taels will be conducted by the Central and other three banks without limit. The three banks will jointly form the Shanghai Silver Dollar and Silver Tael Exchange Management Committee, dedicated to exchange matters. The committee will have seven members, all designated by the Central, China, and Communications Banks. A reporter from the New Voice Society interviewed Mr. Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, a member of the committee, yesterday. According to him, the Exchange Management Committee has decided to establish on March 10 and start operations simultaneously. The location will be on the third floor of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Shanghai Silver Dollar and Silver Tael Exchange Management Committee is urgently preparing for exchange procedures to ensure timely implementation. It is reported that the committee, based on the organizational outline approved by the Ministry of Finance, has drafted detailed rules of procedure, which have been passed by the committee. These rules of procedure provide detailed exchange procedures and are recorded here for reference. According to a person in charge of the committee, rumors circulating outside that one tael equals one dollar and forty cents are completely unfounded. During the transition period of abolishing the tael, although both taels and yuan will be used temporarily, the bank should be the main body. Therefore, the regulation is that one silver dollar equals 0.715 taels. Other conversion methods are all incorrect. The committee's detailed rules of procedure are as follows:</p>
<p>Detailed Rules of Procedure of the Shanghai Silver Dollar and Silver Tael Exchange Management Committee (Agreed on March 7, Republic of China Year 22) Chapter 1, General Provisions, Article 1, These detailed rules are formulated by the committee in accordance with Article 14 of the Shanghai Silver Dollar and Silver Tael Exchange Management Committee Organizational Outline approved by the Ministry of Finance.

Article 3, The standing committee member designated by the Central Bank as a committee member shall be the chairman of this committee. Article 4, This committee is located within the Central Bank of Shanghai. Chapter 2, Committee Members, Article 5, The affairs of this committee shall be decided by the committee meeting and executed by the chairman and standing committee members. The chairman shall represent this committee in external affairs. Article 6, The committee shall meet once every fourth Wednesday of the month. If there are important matters, a temporary meeting shall be held, convened by the chairman. The chairman shall preside over the committee meeting. If the chairman cannot attend due to circumstances, one of the standing committee members shall replace him. Article 7, A quorum of more than half of the committee members must be present for the committee to conduct business, and decisions shall be made by a majority vote of the members present. If a committee member cannot attend due to circumstances, they may entrust a responsible representative to attend. Chapter 3, Committee Affairs, Article 8, Anyone exchanging silver taels for silver dollars or silver dollars for silver taels must fill out a request form, submit it to this committee for verification, and issue an exchange notice to the designated bank for exchange. The request form must be submitted to this committee before 2:00 PM each day in order to issue the exchange notice at 3:00 PM on the same day. Article 9, This committee shall have one secretary to manage committee affairs and several staff members to assist. The secretary shall be transferred from the Central Bank, and the staff members shall be transferred from the three banks. Article 10, The affairs of this committee are divided into two groups: document and accounting, which are handled separately by the secretary directing the staff members. Article 11, The affairs handled by the document group are as follows: 1. Meeting notices and record keeping. 2. Drafting, writing, receiving, dispatching, translating, and filing of documents and telegrams. 3. Affairs not belonging to the accounting group. Article 12, The affairs handled by the accounting group are as follows: 1. Recording, reviewing, compiling, and safekeeping of exchange account books. 2. Review of exchange request forms. 3. Allocation of exchange shares among the three banks. 4. Calculation and reporting of exchange losses. 5. Payment of expenses of this committee and recording of accounts. Chapter 4, Supplementary Provisions, Article 13, If there are any matters not covered in these detailed rules, the committee shall decide on them at any time. Article 14, These detailed rules shall be implemented after being decided by the committee, and the same shall apply to revisions.</p>
<h3>Second Membership Solicitation Conference of the National Goods Promotion Association</h3>

<h3>Zhu Maocheng Discusses the Experience of Investigating European and American Industries</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency Local News, Special Envoy Confucius Xiangxi appointed by the National Government to investigate various countries, and his important staff members Zhu Maocheng, Xu Jianping, etc., arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The reporter of Shenshi Society interviewed Zhu yesterday at his residence. During the interview, he mentioned the investigation task, the route, the current situation in Europe and the United States, and the Sino-Japanese issue. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Investigation Mission) Zhu said, this time special envoy Kong (reported as special convenient, the name is not accurate) was ordered to go to Europe and the United States to investigate the industrial situation, including agriculture, industry, commerce, labor and economic conditions. He visited various places, visited various industrial organizations, visited various important industrial institutions, contacted various social organizations, and conducted personal research at any time and place. Whenever there was an opportunity, he promoted the recent progress of our country and the government's plans to improve various industries in the country to people from all countries, so that they could understand and gain sympathy, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation. Special envoy Kong's reputation, status, and his sincere and amiable spirit of treating people were able to arouse goodwill from all parties, and he was warmly welcomed wherever he went. The gains we have made are not small. As for the organization of the whole group, under the command of special envoy Kong, I (Zhu's own statement) served as technical supervisor and director of affairs, Xu Jianping served as counselor, Li Tang served as secretary, and Zheng Zumu served as police officer and health investigator. Under the command of Kong, we cooperated and divided our work. During this trip, the various cooperation expressions of people from various countries and the recollection of this time made us feel very happy. (Route) On September 2, our party set off from Shanghai and arrived in San Francisco on the 20th via Honolulu. We arrived in New York via St. Louis and Chicago. From New York to Washington, we returned to New York and then went to New York Heifen, Hartford, California, Desolite, and returned to New York. We stayed in the United States until December 18 before going to Europe. On January 5, we first arrived in Hamburg, Germany, and went to Berlin, and then to Essen, traveling through Auberg Haus, Dessau, Cologne, Basel, and then to Geneva, and then to Le Havre, Paris, and Harvard, France, and then to Beijing. From Anlefu to The Hague in the Netherlands, and then to Ambertam, we arrived in England after several turns, and then to Montesquieu, Hettenstafell, Lincoln, Nasten, Bavaria, and after returning to London, we went to Bayan and entered Italy, the country of Turin, Girona, Rome, Milan, Venice, took a boat to Billingdisha, and then left Europe to Egypt via Alexandria, Cairo, via the Suez River, crossed the Red Sea, and arrived in India, experiencing Mumbai, Columbus, Singapore, passing through Hong Kong, and returning to Shanghai. It took half a year. It was originally planned to go to Soviet Russia again. When he was in Europe, special envoy Kong received telegrams from the country urging him to return, so he could not go in person, but he has also sent others to go there.</p>
<p>(World Economy) This trip has given me a deep impression of the world's economic situation. Now, on the surface, all industrial countries in Europe and the United States have a trend of overproduction. However, the actual industry and commerce in Europe and the United States have been declining, which has affected the world. We have many things to learn from the industry and commerce of various industrial countries in Europe and the United States, but we should also know where to avoid their shortcomings. Generally speaking, the social and economic situation in our country is even worse than in other countries. If we encounter this kind of disturbance, the disaster will be even more unimaginable. In recent years, the European and American economies have declined greatly. If you don't go to investigate in person, it may be difficult to believe. Even the United States, which is known as the gold circle machine, who doesn't know that it is the richest country in the world? But based on our on-the-spot observations, many factories in the country have closed down, and production has greatly decreased, even to less than one-third of the total in the previous three or four years. The biggest reason is that there is no restriction on stock trading, and its value has risen and fallen to an alarming extent. In theory, it is enough to make people rich. There was once a stock that suddenly increased in price by 960 times, but the actual capital of the factory or company to which it belonged did not increase accordingly. Secondly, since the wind of free bidding and selling is prevalent, it often leads to overproduction, resulting in mutual competition. For example, a worker originally had no surplus money to buy a car, but because buying a car can be paid in installments, he can use his future wages to offset the current payment. As a result, material enjoyment is booming and unstoppable. For a time, the sales of goods can indeed increase, but this temporary purchasing power is ultimately limited. Once the financial turnover is not smooth and the sales are sluggish, the factories or companies will close down one after another. As a result, the number of unemployed people will increase accordingly. The more unemployed people there are, the weaker the purchasing power, and the more closures of industries will be seen. This is a cause and effect relationship with each other, until it collapses and cannot be cleaned up. Now there are more than 12 million unemployed people in the United States. If the family population is calculated, the average should be about 40 million. Since the industry has declined, the stock price has fallen. As a result, those who were rich in the past are now poor. Although the products are painfully devalued in order to sell, there are many unemployed people and no one is interested. It has evolved into a strange phenomenon in which industrial and agricultural products are mostly abandoned, and many poor people have no food to eat. This trend has directly hit the banks. Banks' usual investment loans have suffered losses due to the decline of the industry. Although many industrial groups have been cleared by the court, there is no way to reverse the decline. In addition, the invention of new automatic machines is enough to replace the majority of people, and the unemployment trend is becoming more and more serious. Social finance is often unstable. Once a bank encounters a run, it cannot cope. Therefore, the current banks in the United States have an order to suspend cash payments. Other most important ones, such as the tariff policy, are highly regarded. Because countries are trying to protect their markets, they have built high tariff barriers. Even the United Kingdom, which is known for free trade, has been caught up in this trend. If a country's goods cannot be freely exported, the way out will be more and more blocked. On the one hand, it is panic, and on the other hand, it is actively expanding its armaments. As a result, the national budget cannot balance revenue and expenditure, and its panic is becoming more and more serious. The situation of the powerful countries such as England, Germany and France is also very similar. According to its fundamental ills, it really starts from not knowing how to control capital, which has a close relationship with world peace and human civilization, and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>(Sino-Japanese Problem) Wherever we went, people would always ask about the Sino-Japanese dispute. We must answer that China is by no means begging others to help it resist the brutal and unreasonable Japan. It only hopes that all countries will fulfill their treaty obligations, especially the signatory countries of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's aggression is of immediate concern to China, and if the countries concerned only ignore it and do not interfere, it is a breach of the treaty. Moreover, today's East Asian disputes are also related to the world economy, which is a very important issue. Japan is deliberately occupying the rich resources of our Northeast, not only to solve its own economic difficulties, but also to use it to achieve its ambition to conquer the world. Japan first sang the open-door policy in the eastern provinces, but the so-called door is actually only crowded with its wooden clogs, and foreigners have no room to intervene. China will now follow the principles set by Sun Yat-sen, and under the protection of sovereignty, welcome cooperation with friendly countries to develop the original resources, so that the world economy will gradually stabilize and will not be difficult to return and will be on the verge of ruin. But before this great cause is carried out, we must first remove the obstacles of monopolists, and Japan is blindly brutal and only knows to use force to seek aggression. If it is allowed to succeed, the world's panic will never end, and plans to seek world peace, such as the disarmament conference, are just dreams.</p>
<h3>Police Matters of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Mr. E.I.M. Barrett, Commissioner of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the International Settlement, has prepared a report on the work done throughout last year and submitted it to the Board of Directors. Excerpts of the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(Number of Police Officers) As of December 31, 1932, the number of personnel in the Shanghai Municipal Police Department was: 487 Western officers, 260 Japanese officers, 633 Sikh officers, and 3,613 Chinese officers. In addition, the number of registered watchmen and patrolmen were: 128 Russians, 442 Indians, and 3,542 Chinese. There were also 534 special police officers.</p>
<p>(Special Meritorious Service) In 1932, four police officers were awarded medals for their exceptional efforts: Deputy Inspector Mr. F.A. Garland, Sergeant R. Urquhart, Pi Bingzhang, and Constable Zhou Xichang. Constable Tian Runsheng and Detective Zhu Jiantang died in the line of duty. In addition, four Western officers and six Chinese officers were injured while apprehending criminals.</p>
<p>(Police Station Construction) The newly built police station on Yulin Road began operations in May. The new Yangshupu Police Station at the corner of Pingliang Road and Goulan Road will be completed in 1933. The old Yangshupu and Huishan police districts have now been divided into three districts, which is more effective. The Chengdu Road Police Station is currently under construction. The Carter Road police dormitory has been completed and is occupied by Western officers. The Baoding Road police dormitory has also begun to be occupied and can accommodate 72 married Chinese officers. This is the first time accommodation has been prepared for Chinese officers with families.</p>
<p>(Traffic Incidents) Since the completion of the Bubbling Well Road, the congestion on Jing'an Temple Road has been slightly reduced. In addition, traffic conditions elsewhere have improved with one-way streets or parking restrictions. However, there is still no improvement on Nanjing Road and the Bund, due to rickshaws, trams, and buses, which are unable to move quickly. The only solution to the rickshaw problem seems to be to gradually reduce their number. The situation with trams and buses could be improved by canceling or relocating their stops. Twelve more traffic lights have been installed. The parking situation is extremely chaotic. Someone suggested converting several lawns on the Bund into parking areas. Special attention has been paid to the bad habit of excessive honking. There were 814 prosecutions this year. 22 driving licenses were revoked for repeated offenses. The total number of cases of violating traffic regulations for the whole year was 46,591, with 6,286 people prosecuted. The tram company currently has 107 locomotives, 107 trailers, and 98 trolleybuses, an increase of 12 from last year. The bus company currently has 164 buses, an increase of 44. There are also 44 private long-distance passenger vehicles and 20 armored vehicles for transporting silver. The number of taxi companies has fallen from 61 to 54, and their vehicles have decreased from 518 to 485. These vehicles are inspected annually for Class A vehicles and semi-annually for Class B vehicles. An average of 11,258 licenses were issued for private rickshaws. These vehicles are also a cause of congestion, and many of them carry passengers privately. The Central and Old Zha districts have prosecuted 345 people. There are currently 9,990 rickshaw licenses, and 16,272 cases of violations have been prosecuted. The number of freight trucks has increased to 1,605. Although their expenses are high, they are used more and more frequently. The number of taxi companies has decreased again. Carriages have decreased from 170 to 111. An average of 11,314 licenses were issued for handcarts and 8,562 licenses were issued for small carts. Lecturers on avoiding danger gave 768 lectures in factories and teahouses this year, with a total audience of over 35,000 people.</p>
<p>(Road Accidents) A total of 12,016 traffic accidents were reported, including 674 serious cases, resulting in 134 deaths and 4,250 injuries. The ages of the deceased were: 6 under 5 years old, 27 between 5 and 15 years old, 63 between 15 and 40 years old, and 38 over 40 years old. The number of accidents and deaths and injuries are slightly lower than last year.</p>
<p>(Police Communication) The police department's current communication methods are roadside telephones, wireless telegraphs, and private branch exchanges of public telephones. Roadside telephones are very helpful for reporting major road accidents. It will be even more convenient in the future if teleprinters are installed. Wireless radio is greatly affected by the disorderly broadcasting in the city and cannot fully demonstrate its effectiveness. However, the most important issue is public cooperation. In the event of an incident, the public must immediately notify the police station by telephone or report it to nearby police officers in person so that they can respond quickly.</p>
<p>(Various Crimes) There were a total of 16,429 cases of various crimes this year, a decrease of 539 cases from 1931 and an increase of 765 cases from 1930. Among them, 9,726 cases were detected and prosecuted, and 5,937 cases were unsolved. The percentage of detected cases is about 1 percent higher than last year, and the rate of unsolved cases is about 5 percent lower. Among the cases, there were 43 major cases of bodily harm, 14 kidnapping cases (25 in 1931 and 16 in 1930). None of the kidnap victims were hidden within the settlement. Four people were rescued by the police department. There were 604 major property crimes, including armed robbery. One police officer and one detective were killed in these robberies. The total number of criminals arrested and sent to court throughout the year was 19,667, of which 17,624 were convicted and 2,043 were released.</p>
<p>(Stolen Property) The total value of stolen property this year was 2,284,313 yuan, of which 647,055 yuan was recovered and returned to the original owners, a percentage of 28.33% (11.26% in 1931 and 21.52% in 1930). Over 19 percent of the stolen amount, namely over 440,000 yuan, was due to theft or fraud, which is difficult to prevent.</p>
<p>(Political Events) Since the January 28th Incident, police operations in the Northern District were impossible, and were extremely difficult in the Eastern District. From February 1 to March 31, a curfew was in effect in the Settlement, prohibiting traffic from 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM. Responsible individuals with special circumstances were granted passes, with a total of 6,228 passes issued. At that time, many people were either arrested or went missing. The police department set up a missing persons investigation unit. After the ceasefire, when residents returned to the war zone, approximately 21,000 passes were issued. During the war, two aircraft bombs and 312 other bullets were reported to have fallen outside the Settlement. Approximately 70,000 refugees fled to the Settlement. At that time, stores were closed and factories were shut down, but fortunately, no major security problems occurred. (Number of Suicides) The police department received reports of 135 Chinese men, 14 Chinese women, 17 Russian men, and 1 Russian woman committing suicide during the year, for a total of 167 people.</p>
<p>(Fingerprint Work) The fingerprint division received fingerprints of 27,978 people this year, of which 7,804 were identified as having previous criminal records. The fingerprints of criminals numbered 24,069, of which 30 percent were identified. First-time offenders numbered 14,449, repeat offenders numbered 2,845, third-time offenders numbered 1,166, and habitual offenders numbered 2,019.</p>
<p>(Amnesty for Criminals) In June of this year, the Chinese government announced an amnesty decree. With the approval of the First Special District Court, a total of 1,959 inmates in the Settlement's prisons were released in succession, including 891 first-time offenders, 472 with prior offenses, and 596 habitual offenders. Of the released criminals, 251 were re-arrested for new offenses, which is approximately 12 percent.</p>
<p>(Communist Party Affairs) The activities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) this year were as before, but their influence in this city seemed to have diminished. Calls for a general strike went unanswered, and only a small number of party members participated in the various commemorative demonstrations held 22 times. Their main task was to raise funds from workers in the city to support the Red Army in the interior. Their work among the workers included posing as promoters of the boycott of Japanese goods movement, organizing football clubs, holding reading groups, or opening night schools. During the war, the CCP propagandized to wounded soldiers and refugees, and also attempted to incite Chinese police officers and the defense forces of various countries. Their methods included propaganda, bribery, and sometimes assassination or intimidation. Their victims were mostly those whom they suspected of being in contact with the authorities. However, the cooperation between the police forces of the three jurisdictions in the city and the punishment by the courts was sufficient to prevent their actions. A total of 103 of their organizations were uncovered by the police department alone or in conjunction with the Chinese authorities this year, and 233 people were arrested and prosecuted, of which 80 were found to have evidence and were handed over to the Chinese authorities, 2 were handed over to the French Concession, 2 were handed over to their respective consuls, 68 were convicted by the Settlement's courts, 56 were released, and 25 were still in custody at the end of the year. A total of 695 types of CCP propaganda were seized, totaling 117,920 copies.</p>
<p>(Strike Statistics) There were 54 strikes this year, affecting 16,969 workers and resulting in 89,805 lost workdays. The reasons for the strikes were: 21 cases were to demand wage increases, 7 cases were to demand improved working conditions, 4 cases were to demand reduced working hours, 12 cases were to support other workers, 3 cases were to respond to strikes in other industries, and 7 cases were for other reasons. As for the resolutions, there were 30 cases where work was resumed unconditionally, 11 cases where workers obtained reasonable conditions, 7 cases where workers were completely satisfied, and the resolutions of the other 6 cases were unclear. Strikes were mediated by third parties in a few cases, while the rest were resolved through direct negotiations between workers and employers before work was resumed. The postal workers' strike from May 22 to May 26 caused great inconvenience to the public. The Municipal Council set up a temporary post office to send letters exclusively to foreign countries. At the same time, the Chinese business community also established a postal delivery agency for local mail within the Chamber of Commerce. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, most Chinese and foreign factories shut down or reduced work, leaving approximately 160,000 workers unemployed. By June, conditions began to return to normal.</p>
<p>(Film Censorship) At the end of this year, there were 40 cinemas in Shanghai, of which 24 were in the International Settlement, 12 were in the French Concession, and 8 were in the Chinese territory. This year, the police department's censors reviewed 562 feature films and 599 short films, totaling approximately 4,463,025 feet. 82 films were ordered to be censored, and 14 films were not allowed to be shown. 5 cases were appealed to the censorship committee, of which 4 were ultimately rejected, and 1 was passed after censorship.</p>
<h3>Liang Long Informs of Fundraising in Germany for Northeastern Refugees</h3>
<p>Raising Funds or Donating Medicine to Help Refugees in Northeast China</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Shanghai Charity Organizations for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a reply yesterday from Mr. Liang Long, Minister to Germany, stating: "To Mr. Ru Tang and Mr. Jue, Since our farewell, I have been constantly thinking of you. Yesterday, I received your letter forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and learned that the refugees in Northeast China are displaced and in dire straits, which is heartbreaking. Fortunately, you have called out and the whole country has responded, with various organizations jointly launching a relief effort for the orphans of the Eastern Provinces, reducing hunger and cold. I am deeply moved. I am also a citizen of the country and dare not fail to do my part to help my compatriots. However, there are very few overseas Chinese here, and most of them are not wealthy, so it may be difficult to raise large sums of money. I now plan to work with the Chinese Students' Association and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce here to find ways to solicit donations from various sectors in Germany, either raising funds or donating medicine, to provide some assistance. Fortunately, the overseas Chinese are all enthusiastic and willing to be your supporters. Once there is some progress, I will report it immediately."</p>

It was decided to hold the meeting this Sunday, with the location to be determined. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Water Company Continues to Cut Off Water Pipes in Various Neighborhoods in Eastern Shanghai</h3>
<p>Association Refusing Water Cutoffs Convenes Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>Resolves on Negotiation and Response Measures</p>
<p>The water cutoff dispute in various neighborhoods on Yangshupu Road, East and West Huade Road, Yuanfang Road, Tangshan Road, and other places in eastern Shanghai has been dragging on until now and there is still no solution. On the morning of the day before yesterday, the water company sent workers to cut off the water supply to Baishou Lane between Huacheng and Pingliang Roads. Fortunately, no accidents occurred. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Another Water Pipe Cutoff) According to investigations, the water pipes cut off by the company in the past two days include those in Sanyuan Lane on Yangshupu Road, Baishou Lane on Pingliang Road, Baifu Lane and Bailu Lane on Huasheng Road, Dongyouheng Road, and storefronts, affecting the drinking water supply of more than 5,000 citizens directly. This has caused panic among residents in various places, who believe that the water company is using coercive means to freely cut off the drinking water supply to various neighborhoods, and that residents in the settlement will be in danger. The Shanghai East Refusal of Water Cutoff Joint Association held an emergency meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to discuss response measures and resolved: 1) To forward letters to the Ratepayers' Association and various groups requesting negotiations to stop further water cutoffs. Resolved to be handled by the secretary. 2) The water taps in the now cut-off neighborhoods have not been opened, and there is no way to obtain drinking water. Resolved to open the water taps daily to maintain life. 3) To dig artesian wells to resist in the long term. Resolved to proceed actively. The representatives of various neighborhoods whose water was cut off in the past two days requested to join the association. Resolved to welcome them. The rest omitted.</p>
<p>(Numerous Letters of Report) After the water cutoff, the owners of various neighborhoods reported to the Real Estate Association one after another and requested prompt negotiations to open the water source and ensure the safety of the people. Excerpts from the original letters are as follows: 1) Deli Company's letter to the Shanghai Real Estate Association: "To whom it may concern, the tap water used by the residents of Baishou Lane between Huasheng Road and Pingliang Road in the eastern district of our company was suddenly cut off by the water company at around 10:00 AM today (March 7th), and more than 1,000 residents were cut off from drinking water, causing great panic. Our company heard the news and immediately rushed to the scene and repeatedly dissuaded them. Fortunately, no accidents occurred. Unexpectedly, the company then shut off the water supply to Baifu Lane and Bailu Lane, increasing the number of people deprived of drinking water by more than 1,000. There are more than 200 buildings in the three neighborhoods, with a total of more than 2,000 people. Water is an essential daily necessity for human life and cannot be lacking. Furthermore, the issue of water fee prices is still under negotiation. The company disregarded everything and suddenly cut off the water supply, which is truly endangering life. We urge your association to actively negotiate with the water company and the Municipal Council to first reconnect and open the water source in order to value people's livelihood and ensure their safety." 2) Sanxin Company's letter to the Shanghai Real Estate Association: "To whom it may concern, due to the water company's price increase, the citizens in the Dongyouheng Road area of our company cannot afford it. The method has not been determined, so the water fee has not been paid. We received a letter on March 26th requesting instructions, but the water company suddenly cut off the water supply today (March 7th), disregarding the lives of the people, causing thousands of citizens to be cut off from their livelihood. For this reason, we are sending this letter to request your assistance immediately to alleviate the suffering of the people."</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Orders Shanghai Chamber of Commerce That Wharfage Dues Are Not Subject to Change</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously stated in a letter from the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Association that the wharfage dues levied by the Jianghai Customs were too high, and the sugar merchants could not afford them. The association repeatedly requested the municipal government to order a correction. It is learned that the municipal government has now instructed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Your letter has been noted. It has been determined that the wharfage dues levied by the Jianghai Customs were jointly determined by all parties. Currently, these wharfage dues have been designated as the municipal bond fund and are not subject to change. Your request should not be discussed further. Please inform."</p>
<h3>Dog Racing Association Sues Martin, Part of the Continued Interrogation Record</h3>
<p>Harris Has Extremely Severe Rebuttals</p>
<p>Asked Why He Bought Dog Racing Association Shares</p>
<p>Following the cancellation of the charges against Mr. Macnaghten, former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in the case of the Dog Racing Association's lawsuit against the closure of the Ming Garden Dog Racing Track, the hearing against Mr. Martin, the current acting Superintendent of the Municipal Council, continued yesterday morning. First, the defendant's lawyer, Mr. Holberton, continued to question Mr. Martin's testimony, followed by rebuttals from the plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Harris. When Mr. Holberton directly inquired about the testimony, Mr. Martin stated the instructions he received from the Municipal Council on March 31 of the previous year to close the dog racing track, the measures he took during the execution, and that he had received external complaints about the dog racing track. Mr. Harris then began his rebuttals, first raising the issue of Mr. Martin's relationship with the Municipal Council, saying that according to your testimony, you have admitted that the actions of April 4 were in accordance with the Municipal Council's policy of prohibiting dog racing. Mr. Martin replied in the negative, saying that he was only acting in accordance with the instructions. Mr. Harris then asked, "But surely your actions on April 4 were in accordance with a resolution?" Mr. Martin replied, "Perhaps so." Then, he inquired about the Municipal Council's refusal to issue permits. Mr. Martin replied that he did not know. He was also asked if he knew about the police's promise to provide protection. He replied that he only protected the public. Then, he changed his tune and cited Mr. Martin's previous statement that the gambling in the dog racing track was enough to cause crime, saying that you have held this view for some time. Mr. Martin replied that he had held this view for a long time. Unexpectedly, Mr. Harris obtained this answer and suddenly raised the issue of Mr. Martin's speculation in the shares of the Dog Racing Association, and cited the defendant's lawyer, Mr. Holberton, as saying that the association was a gambling company whose lifeblood was sucked from the blood and sweat of thousands of Chinese people and people of other countries. He asked Mr. Martin, "What do you think of this?" Mr. Martin replied, "This statement seems accurate." Mr. Harris then suddenly asked, "Then why did you buy shares in a company that sucks the blood and sweat of thousands of Chinese people?" After hesitating for a moment, Mr. Martin replied that it was only for speculation and that he had already sold them for profit before the association started operating dog racing, and that the order to close the Ming Garden Dog Racing Track by the police came three years later. After that, Mr. Harris raised the issue of the power to seal off the dog racing track. Then, as the time reached noon, the judge adjourned the court. The plaintiff's lawyer will continue to rebut Mr. Martin in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Bodyguard Team Leader Becomes a Thief</h3>
<p>Armed Robbery More Than Four Times</p>
<p>Finally Arrested by the City Detective Team</p>
<p>Zhang Fubao, a local from Shanghai's Hunnan District, leader of the ninth squad of the third platoon of the second team of the bodyguard corps, colluded with Chen Jisheng from Ningbo, Chen Sanlian from Tongzhou, and a person nicknamed Little Pockface (also known as Little Red), etc., holding a No. 6210 handgun from the bodyguard corps. On January 20th, at 6 PM, they jointly robbed Wang Fengsheng, an Anhui native who ran the Wanling National Pharmacy at No. 23 Dachang Lane, Xinmatou Street, Nanshi, Shanghai, and also served as the investigation section chief of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo South Railway Station Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, of four gold rings. Also, on February 25th, at 8 AM, at No. 51 Yejialong Lane, Nancang Street, Xiaonanmen, they robbed Jiang Yuhong, a Ningbo native who ran a duck stall on the French Concession's Caishi Street, of a large sum of cash. The case was investigated by Lu Ying, the head of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's detective team, who dispatched Dong Mingde and Han Ruisheng, the chief and deputy leaders of the detectives stationed at the First District Headquarters, as well as detective Yuan Haishan, etc. They learned that the criminals were hiding in the Rongtai Inn near Xiaobeimen. The report was made to Guan Qun, the district chief, who immediately dispatched detectives Yu Maolong, Peng Baolin, Wang Guilin, etc., to work with the local police. The previous evening at 5 PM, they went to the inn and arrested the robbers, and on the spot, they found two Mauser pistol bullets, two six-inch handgun bullets, five rifle bullets, a white bamboo cloth tag with the words "Zhang Hongming, first-class water patrol, No. 2 patrol boat, third team, second district, Jiangsu Water Police," a tag with the words "Zhang Fubao, member No. 213, third platoon, first team, Shanghai Hunnan Bodyguard Corps," and a large strip of blue cloth armband with white characters that said "Shanghai Hunnan District Bodyguard Corps." They were all taken to the district headquarters. After interrogation, Zhang confessed, "I am 30 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 55 Zhangjiazha, South Railway Station. I am the leader of the bodyguard squad. A month ago, I colluded with accomplices Chen Jisheng, Chen Sanlian, and Little Pockface, also known as Little Red, from Tongzhou, etc., to rob a woman in her thirties of 57 yuan on Yejialong Lane, Nancang Street, Xiaonanmen. We went to Hu Yongxing's warehouse in Nanmatou to divide the loot. I got 20 yuan, and Chen Jisheng and the other three each got 9 yuan. On that day, I carried the No. 62170 handgun from the bodyguard corps, which I have now handed over to the team." He also confessed to colluding with others to rob four times in total, including at No. 23 Dachang Lane and No. 51 Yejialong Lane in Nanshi, and that they had spent the stolen cash and jewelry. After Guan, the district chief, verified the confession, he dispatched secret agents Zhang Zhongliang, Pan Qifu, Guo Shiqing, etc., to investigate the remaining accomplices separately. As a result, they also apprehended the principal offender, Chen Jisheng, who confessed to being 30 years old, from Ningbo, and admitted to the robberies without hesitation. Therefore, yesterday, District Chief Guan escorted the two criminals to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives Appeal</h3>
<p>Petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday for Rent Reduction</p>
<p>Shanghai rickshaw pullers Meng Jinchen and others, arguing that the original rental price of 14 cents per day set by the rickshaw company was too high, previously petitioned the Executive Yuan to order the Shanghai Municipal Government to find a way to reduce it to 9 cents per day. The representatives, Meng Jinchen, Ji Hongchun, etc., petitioned the Municipal Government the other day and were received by Li Ruchao, the section chief of the Second Section, who promised to instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to handle the matter after consulting with superiors. At 11 AM yesterday morning, the workers again sent representatives with a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau and were received by Chen Zeyi, a clerk of the Second Section, who promised to find a way to mediate after consulting with superiors. It is reported that the workers are planning to form a rent reduction negotiation committee to handle this matter and issue a declaration requesting assistance from all sectors.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Cartoons Use Enemy Paper</h3>
<p>▲The Paper Industry Association Confirmed the Authenticity</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She said that the Shanghai Paper Industry Association received a letter from the Color Printing Industry Association, reporting that the anti-Japanese cartoons inside the Pyramid cigarettes of Shanghai Fuxin Tobacco Company were printed on enemy goods, which was a joke to friendly countries and undermined the patriotic movement. They requested a defense and authentication. The association convened the Committee for the Examination of Boycotting Japanese Goods, and after unanimous appraisal by the examiners, the paper used for the cartoons, which was plain white cardboard, was indeed Japanese goods. The examiners signed and sealed the appraisal and sent it to the Color Printing Industry Association for verification.</p>

<p>A Large Number of Carnival Items Have Been Found</p>
<p>Celebrating the Coming Match for Decades</p>

It was already reported in various newspapers early on. Wang and others, in order to raise charitable funds, promoted the psychology of social pleasure and aroused the tireless interest of all sectors in doing good. They extensively sought a variety of innovative and welcoming carnival items, such as the Linghu Gao Que Pavilion, and especially the imitation Sanbei style, which is particularly unique. Ten of them have already arrived and are parading in a row, with the performances changing every day, which is particularly eye-catching. Other welcome carnival items, such as the boat drums from under the stone pillars of Fenghua, Ningbo, and the flags, gongs, big pictures, head signs, opening roads, connected lanterns, horse guards, etc. from the southern township, are all things that Shanghai people have never seen before.

In addition, there are various other entertainment and art items. The program details will be revealed gradually.</p>

<p>The Preparatory Committee for China's participation in the Chicago Exposition was ordered to handle the conclusion and return the collected exhibits.

It is reported that the Exhibitors Association will hold a meeting to discuss and decide on the address of the Chinese Pavilion venue.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Collects Reference Books on Maritime Safety Conventions</p>
<p>Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau News: The Maritime Life Safety Convention is being jointly drafted by the Ministries of Communications, Foreign Affairs, and Navy. The procedures have been agreed upon, and the Ministry of Communications has issued a transfer order to Shanghai and instructed the purchase of international legal books on maritime safety from various countries for reference. The Ministry of Communications has also consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the implementation methods of the signatory countries, but the date of the draft implementation is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Soybean Industry Builds Warehouses</h3>
<p>▲ Occupies an Area of Nine Mu - Construction Cost of More Than 200,000 Taels</p>
<p>In the past, the area along the Bund south of Dongjiadu on Nanshi's Outer Ma Road was full of rafts, and the market was deserted. After the soybean industry built dedicated docks, sails and masts sprang up everywhere, and rice merchants gathered there one after another. Land and water transportation became continuous and uninterrupted, and the market has changed greatly. The soybean industry feels that the convenience is not shallow, but the existing docks lack warehouses, which is still a deficiency. If there is surplus rice and no place to store it temporarily, and if merchants automatically store rice and goods in inns in Shanghai, it is very inconvenient. Therefore, the Soybean Industry Association designed and planned the construction of a site. At that time, the San Tai Wharf Heng Yuan Tai Lumber Company was willing to sell a site of more than nine mu, and the Soybean Industry Association negotiated and bought it for 130,000 taels. The property was taken over by the Soybean Industry Association the other day, and it is planned to build a three-story reinforced concrete warehouse, and a dock along the river, similar to the rice dock, 30 feet wide and 50 feet long, with reinforced concrete steps. It has not yet been decided whether the contractor will be Jiu Ji Construction Company. According to the original plan, the warehouse can store more than 100,000 bags, and the total construction and land cost is estimated to be more than 200,000 taels. In addition to issuing construction bonds of 100,000 taels to be subscribed by various businesses, the remaining amount will be repaid after ten years. Currently, the site's existing properties are being used as temporary storage, and various businesses have already stored several thousand shi of goods. Given this situation, once the new warehouse is completed, various businesses will definitely rush to store their goods there.</p>
<h3>Deng Ying'an Is Here</h3>
<p>Deng Ying, a native of Yingshan County, Hubei, is now 24 years old. He used to be a soldier in the local army. Two years ago, he was detained by Han's troops in Yangxin County. He did not return home at the time, and his whereabouts are unknown. His parents and fiancée are still at home, hoping that their beloved son will return home every day. Last year, his father received a letter from a friend in Shanghai, saying that Deng Ying is now serving as a soldier in the Shanghai Public Security Brigade. The family was overjoyed, so at the end of last year, Deng's father packed his bags and came to Shanghai to look for his beloved son. However, Shanghai is a vast city with a large population, and he could not find him. He is currently residing with his nephew, Deng Guozhang (who works at a certain association at the intersection of Beile Road and Lafayette Road). After searching for several months, he has not found him and is very anxious. If he cannot find him, the parents of his fiancée will inevitably marry their daughter to someone else, causing disputes. Therefore, he printed a large number of posters looking for Deng Ying from Yingshan, asking people from all walks of life to pay attention so that the family can be reunited.</p>

Each volume costs 2 yuan, plus 1.6 cents for postage, and is sold at the Medical Bookstore at No. 204 Meibaige Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲The Electrical Industry Semi-Monthly: The use of electricity is becoming more and more widespread, and all industries are becoming electrified. The "New Electrical Industry Semi-Monthly Magazine," edited by Deng Zi'an, a pioneer in the electrical industry, moved from Jinan last year. After being published at No. 25 Central Road, Jiujiang Road, Shanghai, the content has become richer, and sales have therefore increased.

In order to promote the event on the ground, special commissioners were sent to the exhibition site to distribute it for free. The print run is more than 10,000 copies each time, which can be said to be a great sacrifice. If you want to submit a case, you must attach a fee of 2 cents.</p>
<p>City Sounds</p>
<p>▲National Product Pencils at Special Price: During the memorial sale of business resume, the Shanghai branch of the Commercial Press is specially selling books, original Western books, stationery and hardware at a special price, which is changed every week, which is very convenient for all sectors. Among the special priced stationery this week, there is a kind of national product pencil from the 19th Route Army. The quality of the lead and wood is no less than that of imported goods. The original price is 40 cents per dozen, and the special price is only 30 cents, which is the lowest price among similar goods. Those who use national products should be happy to promote it, and the company is also commemorating the loyalty and bravery of the 19th Route Army in defending the country.

<p>▲Yi Xin Educational Supplies Store's Rubber Stamps Sell Well: The rubber stamps for the year, month, and day of the Republic of China are convenient, and people have become accustomed to using them. Since the boycott of the enemy, although factories in our country have imitated them, many are not clever and not durable. Because they are simple and crude, it is regrettable. Now, the Yi Xin Educational Supplies Store in Zhongshi, Fuzhou Road in this city has shipped a large number of rubber stamps from the Gao De Si factory in Germany. The retail and wholesale sales have been very active recently, which shows the urgency of the demand from the Chinese people.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: On the 8th of this month, your newspaper's local news column carried a story about empty coffins in Pudong and the fraudulent claim of life insurance compensation. After reading it, I was very surprised. No. 21 Dongchang Lane, Dongchang Road, Pudong, is the residence of my concubine, Ms. Lin, and is not uninhabited. Ms. Lin's brother died in Qingdao, and following the customs of his hometown, she prepared a coffin and went to Pujiang to summon his soul and stopped the coffin on empty ground. I live far away in the French Concession and did not know about it. Later, I learned that the police bureau of the Third District had found that it was a superstitious act, so they did not pursue the matter. It was also reported in the newspapers on the 3rd of this month that I introduced Ms. Jiang Zhang to the Yongnian Life Insurance Company. I have no relationship with the company, and there is no Yongnian Life Insurance Company in Shanghai. The news disclosed by your newspaper is obviously false. This matter is of great importance to my reputation and I hope you will correct it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Xu Shirong.</p>

<h3>Life and Other Matters</h3>
<p>—— A Message from Ma Luanjun</p>
<p>In today's society, whenever you meet someone, you hear talk of economic decline and the hardship of life. In reality, the economic decline of society does not significantly affect the lives of the wealthy; conversely, even if the economy doesn't decline, there is no solution to the lives of the poor. Needless to say, because I am a poor person, I mostly come into contact with other poor people, so there is a panic about livelihood everywhere. Sir, the environment I am in now cannot be fully described with just a few pieces of paper; I am unable to save myself from my current predicament! I once heard someone tell me that my father was even more impoverished than I am now, but how did he manage to struggle out of his difficult situation and raise me? Although I really want to know about his life experiences and life lessons, he has already passed away and can no longer be my advisor. What kind of hearts do people have? The poor are bullied everywhere: even though the country is in crisis, the cunning and wicked habits of the old society, the mentality of valuing the rich and despising the poor, have not been slightly affected; the atmosphere of each person looking after themselves still exists after all. Knowledge and new culture have only been slightly absorbed by young, inexperienced schoolchildren, but by the time they reach middle age, they inevitably become tainted by the bad habits of the old society, a cycle that never ends. I wonder when the truly accurate and balanced new China will be realized. Sir, right now, I am unwilling to study anything, nor do I have the peace of mind to want to study: my only hope is to maintain my livelihood. Seeking, exploring, desperately searching, but I still cannot find a single thread of survival. Those advertisements that cannot be relied on, especially the ones that require postage, I have tried four or five times, and the result is disappointment; whether it's recruiting staff or hiring professors, I have applied for all of them: I don't know how much transportation and postage I have wasted, and the result is only to increase my regret and disappointment. Even this letter to you, in addition to the postage for sending it, requires five cents for the return postage: today when I went to the post office to mail the letter, I gave twenty copper coins to buy ten cents' worth of stamps, which everyone thought was correct, but that fellow at the stamp counter insisted on twenty-one! Before my father passed away, because his later years were slightly better, he received a position as a clerk in the first section of the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs, with a salary of eighty dollars a month, which allowed us to live a relatively peaceful life: however, his late luck was short-lived, and he fell ill in less than nine months. He originally wanted to bring me to the Department of Civil Affairs to find a job, but after he fell ill, his condition worsened day by day, and he finally failed to settle me properly, and passed away! I can't help but shed tears as I write this! Now that I have lost my father who earned money, it goes without saying that poverty is increasing daily, and friends and relatives are estranged: not to mention pushing each other in times of difficulty, no one is willing to provide even a two-dime subsidy for food! In this recession year, it is fortunate that the national crisis has not befallen Jiangsu, and we can still make a living by going in and out of pawnshops; if it were like the time of the Shanghai war last year, when the pawnshop doors were tightly closed, I don't know how much more difficult it would be! Although I have suffered so much, should I beg for food? I am determined not to take this unpromising path; however, the little money from pawnshops cannot sustain a permanent life no matter what. These days, I am calculating expenses with extra care, except for buying some things that can sustain life, which I cherish as if they were delicacies and gorge on them, I am unwilling to waste even half a cent. And I also take advantage of the days when I pawn things to eat, spending a quiet life in the library every day, as if I were searching for the "golden house in books," which is a delusion. I am not unaware that the saying "there is a golden house in books" is just as unreliable as the recruitment advertisements in the newspaper; but my impoverished situation has reached its final, urgent stage, and I believe that any intelligent person in the world, at this time, would not be able to think of a viable path. If I don't borrow something to relieve my mental distress; then this anxious heart will surely break. Disordered thoughts are enough to affect mental insanity: because of mental insanity, one will commit reckless acts of theft and extortion: because of illegal reckless acts, one must suffer physical punishment. If both the mind and body are damaged, then what other options are there? Therefore, although I am poor, I do not have a one-sided and distorted view of the word "poor." However, I never forget to seek opportunities to ask others for solutions! I am very presumptuous to ask you for spiritual guidance! Please rescue me from hell and lead me to the road to heaven! Because I confidently hope for the help of mankind! Even if it is just spiritual guidance! I will eventually obtain considerable practical benefits. Only foolish men and women seek help from ghosts and gods, and no one sympathizes with them or gives them practical benefits!</p>
<p>Reply; After reading your letter, here is my brief reply: Your first paragraph is very confusing. No one hopes that the decline of the social economy will solve the lives of the poor, nor will it affect the lives of the rich because of this. Because this is a problem of the entire social and economic organization's transformation. That is one. Regarding the story of your life that you have described, we can only express our infinite sympathy for it. We can only curse this ruthless, cold, present society! That is two. I will not reply to the rest in detail, but there is one thing that should be solemnly stated: the members of this column have shallow knowledge, and we rely only on a sincere intention to interact with readers, hoping to use the light of a spark to guide readers on the path to light. Our ability is weak, but our wishes are grand. We know that it is not enough, and we are always afraid of not being able to meet the expectations of the readers. Moreover, we ourselves do not live in heaven, so we have no concept of heaven. From the beginning, we never had the delusion of going to heaven. We only want to unite in hell, become Sun Wukong, Black Whirlwind, or Lu Zhishen, that is, we only want to overthrow the current hell and build our free kingdom on the ruins of this hell. If there really is a heaven, then this place is heaven. What you hope for from us is really too much for us to handle. This is not polite, but the truth. Our minds never allow concepts such as "heaven" and "hell" to dominate us.</p>

<h3>The Peiping-Tianjin Education Association Advocates Shooting Tang Yulin</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 6th, at 11:00 a.m., our reporter paid a special visit to Yang Likui, a standing committee member of the Peiping-Tianjin National Institution Teachers and Staff Union, to inquire about the matters that the Education Association should handle after the fall of Rehe. According to his reply, the fall of Rehe should be entirely the responsibility of Tang Yulin. The state raises soldiers to defend against insults. When the Japanese army invaded Rehe, Tang Yulin should have resisted to the death. However, Tang did not do so, but instead, while the front line was in fierce battle and Chengde had not yet been attacked, he led his troops westward and abandoned Chengde lightly, which is a heinous crime. The central government should be strictly arrested and shot immediately. Rehe has been under Chinese rule since ancient times for more than 2,200 years. During the Warring States period, the state of Yan expanded northward and entered the territory of Rehe. During the Han Dynasty, the southern part of Rehe and the northwestern part of eastern Hebei belonged to the ancient Beiping Commandery, governed by Zhigang, which is now Pingquan County, Rehe. The eastern part of Rehe and the western part of Liaoning belonged to the Liaoxi Commandery, governed by Qielu, west of Chaoyang County, Rehe. During the Jin Dynasty, the Murong clan of the Former Yan rose to prominence, becoming the first local people to emerge. Murong Jian established his capital in Xiancheng, which is now Chaoyang County. During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the state of Zhou was established, governed by Helong, also now Chaoyang County. The Liao Dynasty started in Linhuang, becoming the second group of local people in Rehe to emerge. Linhuang is located in Jianping County, Rehe, and was known as the Upper Capital. Dading (Liaoxi) was the Central Capital, and the eastern part of Rehe belonged to Zheng Yu. The Jin Dynasty used Linhuang as the Northern Capital and Dading as the Central Capital, all of which are now in Rehe, and the Beijing Road and Xijing Road are also now in Rehe. During the Ming Dynasty, the Renning Commandery was established, and the Prince of Ning was enfeoffed here, which is now the land of Pingquan and Chaoyang counties in Rehe. The city of Danning was located northeast of Pingquan County. After Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty, Rehe was gradually abandoned. The Qing Taizong successively settled the two places of Rehe and other places. The first entry into the pass to Beijing was through the Xifeng Pass in Rehe. Because Yuan Chonghuan dispatched troops from outside Shanhaiguan to return to the rescue, the Ming Dynasty was able to extend its life for a few years. Before the Qing Dynasty, the administrative center of Rehe was in Pingquan and Chaoyang. The name of Rehe began in the Qing Dynasty, and Chengde became the administrative center, also beginning in the Qing Dynasty. In the early years of Yongzheng, the Rehe Subprefecture was established, and in the early years of Qianlong, the river administration was established, belonging to Zhili Province. In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, the Rehe Circuit had jurisdiction over the two prefectures of Chengde and Chaoyang. In the third year of the Republic of China, Rehe became an independent Rehe Special Region. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into Rehe Province. After the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, Rehe had jurisdiction over eighteen counties and three administrative bureaus, covering an area of 590,000 square miles, which now all belong to Japan. The population of 4.5 million has also become enslaved. According to the history of Rehe, Rehe is the screen for China, and Tang Yulin has the duty to defend the territory, so he should be shot immediately for fleeing in battle. Not only Tang alone should be shot, but any leader who cannot defend the country should also be dismissed. The troops in Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi should be dispatched immediately and advance from the direction of Shanhaiguan to recover the lost territory of Rehe. The Japanese troops in Peiping should be disarmed across the board, and no Japanese residents should be protected throughout the country. The Japanese troops along the Yangtze River should also be disarmed across the board. Since the Unequal Treaty was first broken by Japan, our country cannot talk about justice with Japan anymore. Our association is scheduled to appoint representatives tomorrow (the 7th) to visit He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, at the Jurentang in Zhongnanhai to inquire about the Rehe issue, and to telegraph the central government to order Zhang Xueliang and the generals on the front line to launch a counterattack as soon as possible. As for the detailed measures, we will wait for the emergency meeting tomorrow (the 7th) to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Qinghua Anti-Japanese Association Held a Representative Assembly on the 6th</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association of Qinghua University is scheduled to hold a representative assembly on the evening of the 6th to discuss measures to deal with the Rehe military situation. The notice is recorded below. Dear attendees, with the loss of Rehe, Peiping and Tianjin are in danger. Our school's students have an unavoidable duty to urgently assist the righteous army. It is hereby decided to hold a representative assembly at 7:00 p.m. on the 6th in the office of this association to discuss how to assist the Rehe military situation and investigate Tang Yulin's measures. We hope that you will take the time to attend. Sincerely, The Anti-Japanese Association of National Tsinghua University. Furthermore, according to Shang Chuandao, a member of the association, Tang Yulin abandoned Chengde and transported private property in military vehicles. He deserves to die. Our association advocates submitting a request to Zhang Xueliang to execute Tang Yulin to apologize to the people of the country.</p>

<p>The Hsinan soccer team played a West Union Group A match against Agaal at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. As a result of Hsinan's brave fighting, they were defeated by the strong enemy with a score of two to zero. Hsinan had three excellent scoring opportunities when they took the field, but all of them were missed. Otherwise, they would have won. The 500 spectators in Yiyuan all sighed in unison. Hsinan will face Agaal again at Yiyuan next Saturday afternoon, at which time they hope to avenge yesterday's defeat. The starting lineups for both sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Agaal</p>
<p>Hughes</p>
<p>Tao Kedou, Ge Deng, Raymond</p>
<p>Henry Tou, Hai Shi, Hui Lie</p>
<p>Haiside, McGlasin, San Taiweixu</p>
<p>Li Te</p>
<p>Hsinan Team</p>
<p>Wang Nanzhen</p>
<p>Lai Zuorong, Chen Zhenhua, Fu Heyi</p>
<p>Xu Heng, Liang Xiaotang, Luo Haiguang</p>
<p>Jiang Shanjing, Gu Shangjing, Yin Guiren</p>
<p>Zhong Yongsen</p>
<p>Volleyball General as Goalkeeper</p>
<p>Hsinan's goalkeeper, Xu Heng, a former Far Eastern representative and volleyball general, attracted the most attention. Under severe pressure, Hsinan's goalkeeper saved many balls. In the second half, there were two sudden balls coming to the ground [that] were both saved by Xu's dive, which was spectacular. Xu also used his volleyball skills for the high balls coming, but he was good at lifting, but not used to catching, so there were corner kicks, which were dangerous. It was not bad that the defense did not concede. It was a pity that the forwards had no scoring talent. In short, defense was better than offense, and the performance was satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Three Excellent Opportunities</h3>
<p>In the first ten minutes, Hsinan had three excellent opportunities that could have been scored but were not, which was really regrettable. Otherwise, they might have made a name for themselves and changed the situation. In less than three minutes, the referee blew the whistle to kick off, and Agaal immediately took the offensive, surrounding Hsinan and attacking with all their strength. Hsinan defended with all their might, and the position did not change. After a quarter of an hour, Hsinan broke through the encirclement, and Zhong Yongsen advanced rapidly from the right. Agaal's two defenders were at a loss, and the ball was passed to the front of the goal, but Haiguang did not score. This was the first time. [Omitted] and Wang Nanzhen got the ball and flew to the left, passing it to the goal, but no one could raise their foot to attack. After three or four circles, Luo still did not shoot accurately. This was the second. The third time Zhong Yongsen advanced from his own side again, and Luo Haiguang was in front of the enemy's goal, ten yards away from the goal, shooting directly at the goal, but it went diagonally out of the goal by a foot. This was the third.</p>
<h3>One Miss and One Goal Conceded</h3>
<p>Hsinan was first under pressure and then lost these three good opportunities, but the morale was slightly boosted. The enemy troops attacked the position from time to time. Half an hour later, Fu Heyi and Wang Nanzhen advanced side by side. When they were about to reach the goal, Haisi rushed forward and kicked it out. The right winger, Li Te, got it and flew in. Chen Zhenxiang missed, and Li Te advanced like a flying [omitted]. Lai Zuorong chased after him, and Li Te passed the ball in the middle with one foot. Hui Lie kicked it in with a bang, and there was no way to escape. Agaal scored the first goal with great difficulty. Hsinan counterattacked again, and Jiang Shanjing had attacked once, but it fell into the goalkeeper's hands, [which] ended with Agaal leading by one to zero in the first half.</p>
<h3>Another Goal in the Second Half</h3>
<p>Hsinan was not as brave in the second half as in the first half, and their strength seemed to have declined. Agaal's performance was also slightly brilliant, and there were also two or three good scoring opportunities that were lost. Once, Jiang Shanjing kicked a free kick thirty yards away from Agaal's goal, and it almost hit. The [omitted] cannon would have been able to boost morale, but the Hsinan forwards knew that there were not many opportunities. In the tenth minute, Hughes came to [omitted] from the left. When he reached the goal, Xu Heng rushed out, but Hughes accidentally flicked his toes, and the ball became a high [omitted] parabola, and Xu Heng's head fell into the goal. Agaal won another goal, and the whole game ended with two to zero.</p>
<h3>Liu Xuesong Returns to China to Take Office at Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Zhejiang University [omitted] urgently asked Mr. Liu Xuesong to return to China to serve as the school's physical education education [omitted]. The entire student body gathered in the auditorium last Monday morning, and President Li Peien introduced him. All the students applauded [omitted] warmly welcomed. Liu graduated from Soochow University in Suzhou in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in physical education, and then served in Shanghai Qingxin Middle School and the Western YMCA, with excellent results.

In 1932, he obtained a master's degree in physical education, and then went to the University of Southern California to specialize in education. In the spring of 1931, he obtained a master's degree in education. Mr. Liu has written two English papers, (1) The Needs of Chinese Physical Education, (2) University Physical Education Administrative Organization.

<h3>Coming from the Water, Going to the Soup</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>—An Economic Maxim—</p>
<p>The United States is regarded as the world's number one richest country. The reason it can become a millionaire, in a nutshell, is because it produces a lot, so it can dump the surplus production into various countries and absorb their cash. But in the past two or three years! Many of the banks opened by this millionaire have successively gone bankrupt. This year, it's terrible. In the forty-eight states across the country, large and small, tall and short banks, like a general strike, have been stranded, run aground, and sunk. The whole city is in chaos, and Mr. Roosevelt, who took office after choosing an auspicious day, is in a panic and doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. As for the reason this millionaire has ended up in this state, according to the results of the microscopic research by experts wearing square hats, it is also because of overproduction. Overproduction can indeed dump the surplus production and make a fortune. But if the eaters in various countries all suffer from indigestion and have poor appetites, unable to digest it, then not only will they not make a fortune, but they will even do a business of trying to steal a chicken and losing the rice. Therefore, they are not embarrassed, but especially embarrassed. We Chinese have a saying, "Coming from the water, going to the soup," which is an unbreakable economic maxim.</p>
<p>Our noble Japan is constantly complaining that it has no raw materials and cannot compete with others to see who is richer, so it is desperately developing on the mainland. It thinks that with raw materials for production, it will not be difficult to absorb the world's money, make a fortune, and become a millionaire. But we must know that the earth has a limited scope, and the population on the earth has a certain number. A certain number of people cannot digest a quantity of goods that exceeds a certain amount. Japan swallowed the Northeast and is desperately wanting to produce more. In this year when the whole world is facing economic bankruptcy, it is hard to guarantee that it will not reach the point where there is no income from water, but the resources has been spent already. By then, even if you jump up and down in a hurry, it will be in vain.</p>
<h3>Encountering Cultural Relics from the Forbidden City</h3>
<p>— Xia Dawu</p>
<p>The wind is very strong today—</p>
<p>A few days ago, the newspapers carried news about the cultural relics of the Forbidden City. The issue of where to store these treasures has been hesitated for a long time. It was originally said that they would be transported to Luoyang and Xi'an for storage, but it was suddenly felt that these two places were inappropriate. It was also said that the old site of the former Renji Hospital had been rented in the French Concession, and a certain engineer had informed a certain construction company to block the steel windows around the site with cement. However, the cultural relics were originally in Pukou, and the idea of storing them in the old building of the Renji Hospital has also been abandoned. A few days later, the cultural relics were also moved across the river to Shanghai. It was also seen in the newspaper that it had been decided to allocate [omitted] thousand and five [omitted] four boxes to Shanghai for storage, part of which would be placed in the vault of the Central Bank, and part of which would be placed in the old site of the Renji Hospital. The resting place of these treasures has finally been settled. Yesterday, I went to southern Shanghai and passed by Tianzhutang Street. When I was walking along the fence, I saw wooden stakes about ten feet long nailed around the foot of the wall of the Renji Building, surrounded by a dense iron wire net. I silently understood, ah—a part of the first batch of cultural relics from the Forbidden City will be stored here today. In the dim twilight, I returned to northern Shanghai, originally passing by the original road, crossing the Avenue Edward VII. Several detectives were holding batons, prohibiting idlers and other vehicles from passing through. Several huge trucks, each carrying—boxes of planks similar to cigarette boxes. Because I was suddenly and unintentionally stopped, I was confused and felt like a cigarette company was stacking and storing boxed cigarettes. Really, really, at that time I felt that way. In a flash, I saw seals affixed to each box, "Cultural Relics of the Forbidden City..." I suddenly woke up, ah, cultural relics of the Forbidden City—I walked past silently, but, at this time, my feeling was like an involuntary wave rising. The two limbs treading on the ground felt a burst of soreness, and the corners of my eyes seemed to be a little wet. I boarded the No. 2 public bus and couldn't help but chuckle. Was it the winter solstice last year? My mother and I went to someone else's ancestral grave to move my father's coffin to our own land. When I got closer to my father's coffin, it was really like this time, and the corners of my eyes involuntarily became wet. However, this kind of statement may be considered inappropriate by others. In fact, I myself can't think of any other way to say it. At that time, Ah Zhong, who lived with me, met me on the bus. He asked me, "Why is there water on your glasses?" I said without hesitation, "The wind is very strong today!"</p>

<p>Fluffy, artificially permed dry hair – permed hair, strands loosening, looking very withered. – Covering a white face with prominent cheekbones, – not naturally white, but transformed with daily use of face powder, scented powder, snow cream... – Two moth eyebrows drawn with charcoal, extending all the way to the ears, but her real eyebrows, not completely removed, still retain a faint blue color. Up close, they look like two snakes on top of her eyes! Below the sunken bridge of the nose is a two-inch wide, thick mouth, painted blood-red. Further down are the black hairs framing her cheeks – the fur collar of her coat. – Further down, a long cheongsam is revealed. Only two layers of fabric, a pair of six-inch round limbs in pointed-toe stockings, wearing high-heeled leather shoes. This is the epitome of the modern “new woman” admired by people today.</p>
<p>A young man dressed like a worker in a blue cloth jacket and pants stands in a crowded place, holding a cheap fountain pen of unknown origin in his hand. Looking shifty and furtively, he whispers to passersby:</p>
<p>"Hey! Want a Parker fountain pen?"</p>
<p>Friends who fall for it will start a conversation with him, have their hard-earned silver dollars swindled away, and return with a useless fountain pen, regretting it immensely. Sometimes, those people even collude with "scrap exchange" people, walking and haggling prices along the way. People who fall for scams are even more easily tricked.</p>
<p>If you encounter such people, it is best to ignore them and just walk on by.</p>

She, however, acts as if it's only natural and sits down without acknowledging him. At the same time, the person who gave up his seat keeps glancing at her. If others in the carriage look at him, his embarrassed state is indescribable.</p>

<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>

<p>Warmly Offering Food, He Kindly Invites the Impoverished Woman to Reminisce</p>
<p>Entering the Door Generously, He Uniquely Embodies the Heroism of a Military Man</p>
<p>The old maid finally had nothing to say and sat down on the edge of the earthen bed to make dumplings. Madam Jiang sat on a broken chair at the foot of the bed, turned sideways and started wrapping dumplings on the bed. Because she hadn’t had dumplings for many days, she was very happy to reunite with them today, and was very enthusiastic to make the dumplings. In a short while, she had wrapped all the dumpling wrappers. When she looked up, she saw the old maid with one leg crossed, one leg propped up, embracing her knees tightly with both hands, head raised, just looking at the roof of the shed. Madam Jiang tapped the edge of the bowl with the chopsticks used to pick up the meat filling, repeatedly saying: "Tsk, tsk, tsk! What are you thinking about again?" The old maid was awakened by the sound of the tapping bowl, could not help but laughed, then put down that leg and wrapped dumplings with her mother. Although her hands were wrapping dumplings, her mind was thinking about how good the Second Master Gan was, not only did he not discriminate between rich and poor, but he silently anticipated what people were thinking. Such a person, whether as a neighbor, a relative, or as... thinking to here, suddenly, she heard the sound of tapping bowl again. Looking down, Madam Jiang stared at her with a serious face, saying: "Old maid, what's wrong with you? Are you going crazy today? How many times have I told you not to believe in such things, yet you always look like this?" The old maid laughed and said: "You are being too strict. Am I not even allowed to think?" After saying that, she pouted and began to wrap dumplings. Madam Jiang said: "It's not that I don't allow you to think, but when I look at you, you are so dizzy. If someone sees you, such a big girl, that would be a laughingstock." The old maid said: "There's nothing funny about it." Although she said this, her attitude softened a lot after her mother's warning, and she silently followed along and wrapped dumplings. Although Madam Jiang was a few years older and a bit old-fashioned, she was once a lady from a noble Manchu family when she was young. Seeing the old maid's expression, what didn't she understand? That day, she didn't say anything else, but secretly added a layer of concern, adding a layer of supervision to the old maid's actions, in addition to her concern. However, their Manchu family still adopted the old customs to some extent, respecting girls especially, and were quite indulgent in letting the girls go to the streets, temples, buy things, and meet guests.

<h3>Palace</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ninging</p>
<p>—Can't Escape Femininity—</p>
<p>The word “palace” is ultimately twofold. The moment it's mentioned, images of magnificent buildings appear in our minds. But is its fate good? If astrologers were to examine it, they would surely say it's in the "Minister of Transportation of Long Life" phase. From when Mr. Someone created it, it has always been walking in great fortune. This isn't me talking nonsense. There's proof that it was born into wealth. So, from birth, it has had a close relationship with the so-called "Ten Thousand People Venerable," the Emperor, the "Son of Heaven." Wherever the Emperor lives, it is always a palace, such as the Main Palace, the Sleeping Palace, the Temporary Palace. But there is one palace that is quite a sight for sore eyes: the Cold Palace. If the Emperor's Wife, no, the Empress, is dissatisfied with the Emperor, she will be demoted to the Cold Palace.</p>
<p>Here, I also associate the word "palace" with being blessed with beauty. It can't escape women, especially when it encounters a romantic emperor. Then, the beauties in the harem number in the thousands, plus the palace maids, female musicians, the scent of powder and rouge, and the enchanting scenery. It's enough for it to enjoy! But whether it is good or bad is up for debate. Women who live in the palace for a long time say: it is as lonely and quiet as a tomb, and the body is bound by everything. But outsiders always view it with mysterious ideals and envy!</p>
<p>Now, after saying a lot, I'm only talking about things from before the 17th and 18th centuries. In this day and age, I might be considered an old villager talking about classics? But no, friends, in this 20th century, it is not necessarily outdated. When building houses, in addition to the three-dimensional, the palace style is considered artistic. Also, the dormitories where female students live, which are good modern buildings, are called the East Palace and the West Palace, and male students generally have mysterious thoughts about these two palaces. So, the word "palace" is ultimately rich and noble, and especially can't escape women!</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Entering Jinzhou in Military Uniform (End)</h3>
<p>— Wang Tianhen</p>
<p>He saw that her sadness was gradually subsiding, and that she gradually smiled when talking to her younger sister or mother, and he was even more delighted in his heart. At this time, he felt a kind of emptiness and desolation, and there was a kind of terror: he was guarding against her returning to Jinzhou. He urgently wanted to take this opportunity to end the relationship of friends and classmates. So one evening, he mustered up the courage to propose to her, which was already the seventh day she had been living in his home.</p>
<p>However, he didn't have the courage to propose marriage without opening his mouth first. He sat on a chair two feet away from the bed she was sitting on, and said in a voice that was not too high or too low:</p>
<p>"Qionghua! You are really unlucky! Traveling thousands of miles to Shanghai with your mother to take refuge, but unexpectedly your aunt died of illness, leaving you alone. How can you return to your hometown?! I think...you are alone, so you don't have to go back!" He was still probing, his heart beating violently.</p>
<p>"Why not go back?" She was very calm: "This time I came to Shanghai, it was all for my mother! Me, who wants to take refuge! This disaster is not an ordinary disaster that can be avoided; it requires us, the people, to eliminate this disaster. I did it entirely for my mother. She was old and had to move out of necessity. Unexpectedly, she finally died in a foreign land! I really don't want to avoid it, nor can I bear to avoid it myself. If all the people of the country avoid it like this when they encounter disaster, this disaster will follow the footsteps of the refugees like a river bursting its banks, clinging tightly and not letting go, leaving them with no place to hide. Wouldn't that be the destruction of the country, where there is disaster everywhere and there is no way to avoid it?"</p>
<p>He was stunned! He was silent for a long time. He thought to himself: According to what she said, she might leave Shanghai soon, how could he delay any longer! So, he mustered up his courage, and moved his body to sit on the bed, side by side with her, and said in a trembling voice: "Qionghua! That's right! But I have a word that has been hidden in my heart for a long time, and I have to say it to you: I ask you to allow me to be my life partner..." Saying this, his voice trembled even more violently, unable to continue speaking; he reached out and took her arm, bowed slightly and kissed it.</p>
<p>Qionghua did not answer immediately, but was concentrating. It took a long time before she said: "Shengzhi! I knew your heart a long time ago, how can I not agree to you! When I decided to live here, it was equivalent to agreeing to you. But I have a simple condition: We must go to Jinzhou to get married!"</p>
<p>He was even more stunned! He looked up at her face.</p>
<p>"You must go to Jinzhou! And I want you to enter Jinzhou in military uniform!" – Her expression was still calm, and she continued: "It doesn't necessarily require you to wear a command sword as a military officer. Even a small soldier is fine, but you must enter Jinzhou in military uniform; I will return to my hometown first, so that I can meet you at the edge of the city. It doesn't have to be limited to this year or next year, even if it's five or ten years, it doesn't matter, I will always be waiting for you in my hometown of Jinzhou. Otherwise, I have no other hopes."</p>
<p>He already understood her meaning, and after thinking for a while, he stood up resolutely and said:</p>
<p>"Okay! I will definitely follow your condition!"</p>

<p>National Products Forum</p>
<h3>Success of Production and Sales Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Congratulating the Opening of the China National Products Introduction General Office</p>
<p>The two most gratifying events in the National Products Year are the establishment of the China National Products Company and the opening of the China National Products Introduction Office tomorrow. These two tasks both originate from the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and are both basic tasks for solving people's livelihood problems, the only way to strive for material construction, and an unparalleled tool to prevent international trade deficits and establish national defense in production. The Production and Sales Cooperation Association shoulders this important mission, fulfilling the responsibility of promoting the products of national product factories and improving publicity, and also fulfilling the natural duty of introducing local products and industrial raw materials to domestic and foreign markets. In order to further promote its effectiveness and penetrate inland, national product introduction offices have been set up in various places, and the Shanghai General Office has been established to gather their achievements. Its greatest task is to introduce goods from various places to domestic and foreign markets, report on consumption conditions, display national product samples, and accept wholesale orders, so that Chinese people can recognize the advantages of national products, distinguish the standards for selection and purchase, and ensure that producers do not have to wait for favors and sellers save the trouble of selection. The institute declares: "Engage in the research of 'quality' improvement, 'quantity' increase, 'price' equilibrium, and 'market' conditions, with the aim of establishing a close relationship between the production and sales parties, and achieving the effectiveness of division of labor and cooperation." Excellent, with this kind of spirit to serve the national product industry, it can be said to be the success of production and sales cooperation. It is hoped that the institute will put its declaration into practice, do it practically, not speak empty words, not make big words, not issue blank checks, not care about personal interests, and have a great effect a year later, which can be predicted.</p>
<h3>The Chicago Exposition Exhibition in the National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Wang Weizhu</p>
<p>China National Products Company Continues to Work Hard</p>
<p>The public exhibition in Shanghai of exhibits collected for the Chicago Exposition is quite commendable. The people collecting exhibits are admirable for taking the trouble to travel far and wide. The exhibitors are even more indispensable for putting their heart and soul into it to promote national glory. In the current situation of frequent disasters and unstable people's lives, this achievement is not easy. It is indeed enough to compete with foreigners for a day's length abroad and show the progress of our country's crafts in recent years. However, recently, the Executive Yuan believed that the national crisis was urgent, and the entire nation should concentrate economic power to fight against the enemy. This is indeed the government's unavoidable difficulty. However, the exhibitors and organizers spent a lot of money and time to obtain such excellent exhibits. Once participation is stopped, they feel it is a pity. Now the exhibitors have established an exhibitors association in their personal capacity to participate in the United States automatically. It is believed that this remedial measure is also a good spirit of our nation. Even if it cannot go abroad, the effort to participate in the collection exhibition should not be wasted. At present, the whole country is unanimously promoting national products in order to seek danger and survival. In fact, there is a great need for an opportunity to publicly display concentrated and exquisite national products. To promote national products, the people of the whole country must first deeply recognize the advantages and characteristics of national products, so as to eliminate the inferior nature of despising national products in general, and enable them to distinguish what is a national product and what is not a national product, or what kind of foreign goods have national product substitutes, so as not to be deceived by unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, the reporter hopes that compatriots who have visited the collection exhibition can keep the images of various exquisite national products (such as ornaments, silk weaving, ceramics, lacquerware, art, etc.) that they saw during the visit permanently imprinted in their minds, so that the establishment of the exhibition will not be in vain. Furthermore, promoting national products should not only be carried out domestically, but also promoted abroad, which is the way to enrich the country and benefit the people. Our country is vast and rich in resources. In the past, various agricultural products were exported a lot. Gradually, farmers did not know how to improve, and a small number of merchants had short-sightedness and sold inferior goods mixed together. As a result, international markets lost credibility. Over the years, the trade deficit has increased sharply, which is painful to say. In view of this, the government has established commodity inspection bureaus in various places to crack down on inferior goods and established international trade bureaus to promote overseas trade. Advanced people and promising merchants have now organized national product companies to promote national products and resist inferior goods, which is of great benefit to the country and the people. Recently, the China National Products Company issued a declaration, which roughly stated, "Our country prepared to participate in Chicago. The exposition took half a year to collect the grand view. Unexpectedly, we encountered national disasters, which led to the end of the order, which is deeply regrettable. Our company is responsible for promoting national products and has the obligation to publicize national products. Therefore, based on this purpose, we have designated a location specifically for exhibitors to move, display and exhibit. In addition, the items participating in this time are all the essence of national products. Those who have visited have wanted to buy them but could not. As a result, they turned to our company to inquire about ordering them. There must be several occurrences every day. If the exhibitors are willing to sell, our company is willing to promote them and do our best." The China National Products Company is the only national product company in Shanghai that can continue to work hard. It is really the gospel of the national product industry. I sincerely hope that the exhibitors will cooperate with them to meet the needs of the people in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Observational Work That the National Products Industry Should Have</h3>
<p>— Pan Yang'an</p>
<p>The recent progress of China's national products industry is indeed an undeniable fact, but looking at the progress of industry in various countries around the world, we really can't help but feel ashamed. Well, will we continue to stick to our old ways or will we put in some effort to observe the progress of others and use it as a reference for improvement? This has become a major problem at present.</p>
<p>Since we cannot be satisfied with the reality and cannot deny the progress of others, in order to find a way out in the increasingly competitive international production industry, we should naturally put in some effort to observe and research. In today's rapidly changing production industry, there is a trend of not advancing is to retreat. Of course, my country's national products production industry must eliminate the attitude of being arrogant and ignorant.</p>
<p>In recent years, the rapid advancement of Soviet industry and the harvest of the five-year plan have alarmed the general advanced countries. According to newspaper reports, the recent promotion of heavy industry has even more great statistics. The fact that the Soviet Union can stand out from a country with backward industries is indeed something that we, who are stranded in the era of a broken rural economic organization, can learn from. Therefore, our Chinese production industry can ignore the differences in political systems, and it is really necessary to observe the Soviet industry and find out the key to the success of the industry from the path of development of others. Recently, the government has organized, together with the business and financial communities, a Soviet Union inspection group, which is very valuable. I hope that the national products industry will actively participate and make it a reality as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The American Chicago Exposition collects products from various countries, and is a model of the world's production trends in terms of skills and quality. It is also an opportunity for mutual comparison. If my country participates and compares its own goods with those of others, it can certainly understand its own strengths and weaknesses; even if my country does not participate, we can also understand the strengths of others in their products.</p>
<p>It is said that it costs 700 US dollars per person to participate in the Chicago Expo in the United States. If we can make the trip worthwhile, these numbers are not a waste. As for going to Russia for inspection, the cost can be saved, and it is felt that it is very worthwhile.</p>
<p>Naturally, we are not extremely worshiping foreigners; other people's products naturally also have shortcomings, and our things also have strengths, but taking the strengths of others and removing the shortcomings of others, gathering the beauty of various countries in one place, if we can work hard to improve through mutual learning, our national products production industry will naturally have a great development, and we can also complete the heavy task of improvement in our production industry in the National Products Year!</p>

<h3>The Cultivation of Shopkeepers</h3>
<p>— Sleeper</p>
<p>Promoting national products and revitalizing national products cannot be achieved by empty slogans. We must work, manufacture, publicize, and sell in the field to achieve success. For those who promote and sell, the boss should work hard to do it. To do it, you must have the knowledge and skills of sales. If you don't have it, you should prepare and cultivate yourself:</p>
<p>I. Who are our customers! As long as they are people, no matter whether they are rich or poor, noble or humble, they are our customers; when customers walk into the store, they must be sincerely entertained, and should not be excessively flattered because their clothes are gorgeous, and should not be despised because their clothes are simple. Regardless of whether they come in intentionally or unintentionally, you must use your own skills to overcome the customer's hesitant opinions and induce the customer's eager-to-try mentality. If he is really unwilling to buy, you should not have a cold attitude, and should still send him off peacefully. You must know that coldness is an expression of resentment, and resentment gives people shame. If you are ashamed and angry, the transaction will fail; on the contrary, although this time you did not trade goods, a very deep mark must be imprinted on his brain, and when he thinks of goods, your character will appear, so he will become your customer, and a permanent customer.</p>
<p>II. Personal and store decoration - This is a very important issue. Who likes to go to a dark, dirty, and messy store to buy things? Also, who is willing to talk to someone with a black collar, wrinkled clothes, and a sour smell in their mouth? Therefore, the boss should pay attention to the neat arrangement of the windows, the spotless counter, and he needs a snow-white collar, shiny shoes, clean teeth, and neat clothes to suit the customer's comfortable psychology.</p>
<p>III. Knowledge of goods - It is not possible for the boss to be sloppy about the knowledge of goods. Fortunately, books, newspapers, and experiences can provide you with knowledge, and you can gradually recognize them. For example, if there are two kinds of things with the same purpose, you can carefully explain the advantages of your own goods to the customer, such as the fact that Japanese goods are made of reduced materials and will not last long, while national products are strong and durable. In addition, if the goods are slightly damaged, you should explain the reason for the damage, and do not let the customer think that your goods have defects.</p>
<p>IV. Observing the psychology of customers - Customers have different personalities and different careers, some are free and some are busy. When they come in, you should immediately see what kind they belong to: busy people have extremely precious time, you should give them honest service, strive for speed, and increase your effectiveness; free people, you may as well chat with him, guide him to visit your goods, give him a brief explanation, a detailed explanation, and be sure to make him satisfied with the purchase before he leaves.</p>
<p>V. Maintaining friendship - When you come to buy things, you are considered your customer, but you cannot hope to sign a contract with your customer that does not allow him to trade with other stores; but you can work hard to build your friendship and pull him in invisibly to become your permanent customer; using your communication skills, you can not only pull in one customer, but also attract other customers, so maintaining friendship with close customers is also a way to boost your business.</p>
<p>Reading and research - Knowledge is endless. In order to develop your business, you must work hard to acquire knowledge in your spare time, read more newspapers and magazines, and study application skills to meet the needs of your business.</p>

<h3>Women's Responsibility for the National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Dr. Ge Chenghui</p>
<p>Sitting on low stools in the Shuyi Society Kindergarten, together with many wives, attending a family improvement meeting seemed like a common family banquet, or like a game from our childhood. However, when Dr. Ge Chenghui gave her speech, although somewhat humorous, everyone listened attentively, sometimes erupting in uproarious laughter,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>replacing the applause of ordinary meetings. This record is not Dr. Ge's full text, but only a part related to our National Goods Weekly, which should also be stated. (Qia Ji)</p>
<p>How should we women save the country? In this year of severe national crisis, most of our female compatriots cannot go to the front lines, nor can they go to rear hospitals to work as nurses. Amidst</p>
<p>these calls for something, something to save the country, I think starting with using national goods is relatively easy, because buying things is the responsibility of housewives. (Naturally, those who need men to buy shoes are excluded.) Moreover, national goods are relatively cheaper, so it's best to use national goods if possible. Little people wear red and green every year, and adults wear black and blue every year, and there's really nothing inconvenient about it.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of national goods, we can divide it into three steps. First: use them ourselves; second: use them at home, because most household items are bought by women; women have real power in using national goods. Third: supervise friends and family. The first two items only require determination, while the third item uses a method of honor, mutual supervision. For example, when people give me gifts that are not national goods, I can politely refuse to accept them. When I see people using substitutes for national goods at banquets, I will not hesitate to point it out. I have tried the above methods myself, and the results have been very good, so I am introducing them to everyone! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Who Dislikes National Goods the Most?</h3>
<p>— Tianran</p>
<p>▲Could it be the students?</p>
<p>Everyone, who dislikes national goods the most in society? Everyone must say it's modern women. Alas! Injustice, injustice, facts speak louder than eloquence. According to a friend who works for a Chinese national goods company, he told me that he pays attention to the types of customers all day long, and later obtained a surprising statistic: the largest category is female mistresses and young ladies, accounting for four or five tenths. The second largest is people working in industry and commerce, accounting for two or three tenths. Stylish women are also not a small number, while the smallest number are students in schools. What university students, middle school students, elementary school students, all male and female students, I don't know where they've gone. He thought that perhaps he could have more student patrons during Sunday holidays. However, the result of the statistics was still very disappointing. Alas! Students who call themselves the intellectual class, who claim to lead everything, pitiful and lamentable students, are they the ones who dislike national goods? Alas, inexplicably, it really makes people extremely suspicious. Ask the school dormitory manager; on the leave slips, most say they are going out shopping. What are they buying? I'm afraid it's what Mr. Wang Xiaolai said. (Eastern goods, Western goods.) Not national goods. If young students are like this, what hope is there for others? I am not here to satirize students. Our country places the most sincere and enthusiastic hope on students, so I dare to bring up this point. Teachers who teach students, as well as gentlemen who lecture here and give speeches there, please spend five or ten minutes of your time and give these students who don't quite believe in national goods a few shots of morphine, take a few doses of stimulants, and advise the students to wake up quickly. From now on, don't sing high-pitched songs or talk big, but start by happily using national goods and first make a vow:</p>
<p>"From now on, for our needs of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation, we will only buy national goods." Not only regulate ourselves, but also persuade our families. Not only persuade our own families, but also persuade many people, and immediately break off contact with people who dislike national goods. Only in this way are we worthy of being called students, and only then are we considered Chinese.</p>
<p>Students, in a few days, I will go ask this friend who works for the Chinese National Goods Company again to see what his statistical results are. Who is it that dislikes national goods the most?</p>
<p>National Goods Speech</p>
<h3>Words from Two Sponsors of National Goods Introduction Centers</h3>
<p>— Xue Guangqian</p>
<p>In recent times, the national goods movement has risen like a storm. However, to make national goods widely sold, the supply and demand must correspond, and trade must be suitable. To make everyone happy to use national goods, consumers must first recognize the advantages of national goods and the convenience of choosing and purchasing them. Therefore, the establishment of national goods introduction centers in various places is a matter of urgent importance. Mr. Li Zumo of Qingdao and Mr. Shi Menghu of Shantou, in view of this, each planned to set up national goods introduction centers in their respective areas. They recounted the purpose of their preparations at the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association! It is very detailed, and recorded here, so as to help those who come later.</p>
<p>(Mr. Li Zumo) Last October, I came to Shanghai from Qingdao. I happened to be talking to Mr. Fang Yexian of the China Chemical Industry Society about organizing a national goods introduction center. I deeply felt that the country was in such difficult times, and that promoting national goods, regardless of whether it was for profit or not, was the duty of citizens. I returned to contact local people, and they agreed very enthusiastically. So I started to work, preparing actively. Until today, the capital has been raised, and the address has also been determined. I was specially sent south to make contact. However, I have always served in the transportation industry, and I am quite unfamiliar with the situation in the business world. I hope to be instructed.</p>
<p>Here, please let me describe the organizational content and business policy of the Qingdao National Goods Introduction Center. It is named Shandong National Goods Co., Ltd., because in the future, we plan to set up branches in various important commercial ports within Shandong Province, such as Jinan and Yantai, so that the scope can include the entire Shandong Province. Therefore, it is called the General Company. We have now found the entire third floor of the Shandong Road Transportation Bank in Qingdao as the address. The building is high and spacious, and the place is large. In addition to opening a company, it can also accommodate other national goods groups. The capital is 100,000 yuan, with shops and shares accounting for two-thirds, partly to use them as distribution branches, and partly to adapt to the spirit of our production and sales cooperation.</p>
<p>Business is divided into two parts: (1) ordering, (2) wholesale. Ordering is done according to the goods sold by each factory, and no commission is charged. Wholesale involves purchasing goods in advance to prepare for the selection and purchase of various small shops. As for transportation, one of the shareholders in the company runs a transportation business, so freight can be discounted specially. At the same time, I have about ten coal ships arriving in Shanghai every month in the transportation industry. They used to return to Qingdao empty after unloading. In the future, we can use them to load goods. Qingdao merchants can save expenses and get various transportation benefits. I am confident that we will succeed.</p>
<p>Qingdao is a commercial hub in North China. After being managed by Germany and Japan, it was returned to our country. The transportation construction is not only leading in North China, but also in China. Moreover, due to diplomatic relations, it is not affected by military affairs. Therefore, commerce is booming, and the population is increasing with time. According to official reports, in 1925, the population was only 190,000, but last year it increased to 700,000. The customs revenue in 1925 ranked ninth. Now, other than Shanghai and Guangzhou, Qingdao ranks third. Based on this, it is not difficult to predict that Qingdao in ten years will be on par with Shanghai. Brothers speak of this, so I hope to draw everyone's attention to Qingdao as the most promising place for the development of national goods, and to devote all efforts to it. The future of national goods really depends on it.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Shi Menghu This trip is for the sake of national goods. Because I see that in the Shantou area, commerce is flourishing, and the highways of the entire province have already begun construction. However, the import of foreign goods has increased without end, while the sales of national goods have decreased. The outflow of interests is countless. Examining the reasons for the sluggish sales of national goods, it is because the Chinese in Shantou have never paid attention to national goods, while foreigners are always using their brains and efforts to make sales plans in an organized way. Now, they are intensifying their efforts to prepare for driving straight in and penetrating the inland after the highways of the entire province are built. So, if we don't pay attention now, I'm afraid there will never be another opportunity to pay attention. I dare to ask general national goods manufacturers to help and support me, so that the promotion of national goods in Shantou will be successful, and the funds that people use to buy foreign goods can be changed to buy national goods. This is to plug the leaks and recover interests. How can it be measured by distance? As for what kind of goods can be sold in Shantou and what kind of goods cannot be sold, it is not a problem at all. Because the purchasing power of the people in Shantou is still not weak, any goods can be sold. The Taisan Department Store, which I run in Shantou, is doing very well, so please don't worry about this point. I hope to sincerely work with Shantou to promote national goods and make them popular for a while.</p>
<p>New Industry Introduction</p>
<h3>The Process of Soda Production by Jiuda Refined Salt Company</h3>
<p>Soda is one of the basic raw materials for the chemical industry. Domestic demand has always relied on foreign goods. Since the Jiuda Refined Salt Company invented soda production, it has not only been able to supply itself, but also compete in foreign markets, recovering countless interests. Mr. Fan Xudong, the manager of Jiuda Refined Salt Company, came to Shanghai a few days ago to investigate. He advocated that the promotion of national goods should be organized. The following is a conversation about the process of soda production by Jiuda (recorded by Guangqian): The industry I run is salt and soda. Although what I studied was related to chemistry, I didn't initially intend to do this kind of business. Later, in the north, I saw that there were millions of dan of salt accumulated everywhere. Because the local supply exceeded demand, it couldn't be sold, so salt producers felt very painful, and small industrial life became like slavery. Salt entered the hands of salt merchants, and they couldn't sell it either, and their lives were very difficult. At that time, I calculated the cost and felt that no matter what, it would be lower than the purchase price? So in 1921, I asked the government to try making 100 dan. Unexpectedly, due to government laws, the salt merchant system, rampant salt smugglers, and various other factors, the reality was the opposite. The cost exceeded the market price. After various struggles, I was able to alleviate some of the pain, but there is still no thorough solution to date. So I wanted to open a new path for Chinese salt, to make it an industrial product and exhaust its benefits. As for chemical industrial raw materials, one is acid, and one is soda. In 1926, I thought of making salt into soda. This method has been around the world for more than 70 years and has patents, so to make it myself, the first difficult thing was that I couldn't buy the machines even with money, so it was delayed until 1927 before I achieved my goal. Initially, all production was only enough for my own use. Now, we are working day and night, and we can produce 200,000 dan every day. There are no foreign technicians in the factory, but we send people to foreign countries to investigate and study at any time. Three years ago, everyone knows that this was the period when the world's trusts were becoming established. Now, it is gratifying and pleasing that China can actually defeat them. At present, Chinese chemical manufactured goods can not only be transported to foreign countries, but also sold to Japan, Annam, and various parts of Southeast Asia. This proves that Chinese people do have the ability to invent, but they don't have the determination to struggle, so everything is backward! Looking at the current situation in China, absolute industrialization is necessary. This certainly doesn't mean that factories should be set up all over the country. What I mean is that China is still in the era of small-scale peasant economy. It is natural to feel pain when competing with world machinery. However, in recent times, political instability and people's livelihoods are difficult, all due to the fact that small-scale peasants cannot resist machinery. At the same time, we want to survive, and we want to develop as a whole. Therefore, I personally advocate that people who run industries should have an organization, just as merchants have chambers of commerce. Because the industrial world does not have a group, there is no organization and the strength is scattered. Things such as transportation, raw materials, and security are also very important, and can be regarded as a matter of life and death for running an industry. At the same time, we must also provide considerable assistance to small industries, because only when small industries gradually develop can large industries have a way, and China can be industrialized!</p>
<p>Editor's Notes</p>
<p>University Students and Bank Clerks An old friend, Mr. Jin, especially told the editor that you are promoting national goods and sparing no effort, but even if you put in your best effort, I'm afraid it will be in vain, because in society, those who are called the highest leaders of knowledge, in the academic world are university students, and in the business world are bank clerks. However, these two types of people are the strongest promoters of foreign goods. Wearing Western suits, eating Western food, smoking foreign cigarettes, using foreign stationery, and buying foreign cosmetics, one is to show their fashion, and the other is to show their extravagance. They are born with cheap bones that are happy to use foreign goods, as if they are enemies with national goods and are unwilling to use them. Speaking of this kind of person, they are really hateful and killable. May I ask how you can change their bad habits, influence them, and make them change their minds and be happy to use national goods. These words left me speechless. Later, I said, whose responsibility is this? To the advanced in the educational world, and the leaders of the banking industry, please stop singing high-pitched songs and talking about distant things. What saving the country, what saving the country, is all empty. First strictly train and correct the students under your guidance, and the clerks under your management, to wash away the shame of only liking foreign goods. Only then are you qualified to talk about saving the country. Otherwise, you still can't manage and teach your own people well, so just eat your peaceful meals and refrain from opening your noble mouths.</p>
<p>National Goods Exhibition Deep into the People Promoting national goods and exhibiting national goods, in Shanghai, a lot of effort has been put in, but the counties and towns in the interior still do not know the beauty of national goods, and are still places where foreign goods are sold. Therefore, the current work is to promote national goods to the interior and deep into the people. The best way to go deep into the people is for each factory to hold national goods exhibitions in various places separately, to awaken the determination of patriotic men and women in various places to use national goods. Now there is good news. I heard that the public education centers in various places have successively contacted the China National Goods Guidance Center of the China Vocational Education Society to hold national goods exhibitions in various places. The center has also united with well-known pure national goods factories in Shanghai to participate together. This fundamental work of saving the country is very valuable and effective. I hope that factories will actively participate and public education centers in various places will actively emulate it, so as to create an unprecedented record in this National Goods Year.</p>
<p>Where to Go A group of students, after leaving school, can you pay attention to where they are going? Are they going to national goods companies? Are they going to bookstores? Are they going to libraries? Alas, no, no, even if they go, it's a pitiful one in ten. Cinemas, dance halls, parks, and entertainment venues are what they patronize, and where their footprints are found. Libraries that seek knowledge, and national goods companies that sell genuine national goods, they don't seem to be worthy of entering. Alas, it's really pitiful, education is bankrupt, education is bankrupt.</p>
<p>Trying to Grow Yellow Hibiscus Mr. Fang Chunting of Nanmen Main Street, Nanhui, wrote to say that the yellow hibiscus in his hometown is an important material for paper mills. After trying to grow it in recent years, the benefits are very large. On the one hand, he hopes that everyone will try to grow it, and on the other hand, he hopes that paper mills in Shanghai will promote it. This is also a side business for rural areas. I think that national goods paper mills, such as Jiangnan, Longzhang, and Tianzhang, Jincheng, etc., must have good guidance to answer Mr. Fang.</p>

<h3>After Visiting the Preliminary Exhibition of the Chicago Exposition</h3>
<p>— Hekou</p>
<p>The preliminary exhibition of the Chicago Exposition held in Shanghai this time can be regarded as the only grand event in our country after the West Lake Exposition. The items displayed in the exhibition were all special products from various places, so it was enough to broaden our knowledge; moreover, these many exhibits were to be sent to the United States for people from all over the world to see, and I felt that it was even more worthwhile to visit.</p>
<p>What I saw at the venue was beautiful and exquisite Jiangxi porcelain, colorful and pleasing Fujian lacquerware, high-quality Hangzhou silk, various kinds of black tea and green tea, lifelike carved models, and Hunan embroidery, calligraphy, and paintings. It was truly a feast for the eyes. Indeed, our national goods are really good, and foreigners may sigh in inferiority.</p>
<p>However, I feel that the new industries and engineering aspects are too bleak. There are only a few kinds of food and enamel in the new industries, and in terms of engineering, except for a few architectural models and two electric machines from Jiaotong University, there is simply very little. This is strange. Is it because our national new industrial products are not good and inconvenient for the public to see? This is too absurd. Although our country's science is immature and our industry is backward, and our products are not as good as those of Europe and the United States, we should at least show people our poor achievements of the past ten years: first, we can compare and learn from foreign goods; second, it is also enough to show that although we are backward, we are still working hard to strive, so that foreigners will not think that we are just sticking to the old ways and will not make progress; moreover, the charcoal car and rockets invented by Mr. Tang Zhongming recently have even more significance to participate in this exhibition, but they are absent, which really makes me inexplicable!</p>
<p>In our country, where wars are fought year after year, even if the results of production are not very good, it is not very difficult to understand. As long as we have our new achievements, it is enough to show our enterprising spirit. If we only use a few existing special products and always make our good achievements, this may be called "rehashed leftovers" by foreigners.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial Market Gold Bullion Rises Very Strongly</h3>
<p>Closing at 707 taels and a half, soaring 25 taels higher than before. The driving force is the depletion of spot goods and tight foreign exchange. Short covering and long speculation create strong buying interest.</p>
<p>Gold Market: After the storm subsided slightly the day before yesterday, the market suddenly saw a rebound yesterday morning. Initially, foreign news indicated that London spot and forward prices had risen by 18.75. However, due to rumors of a small private deal of 0.25 reported by the Bank of America, the market quickly stabilized even though unconfirmed. Chunyuan, Yongfu, Shunyi, Fengyong, and others purchased outside the market. When trading opened at 9:30 AM, the price rose to 687 taels. Although it retreated to 5.5 taels, the HSBC exchange rate was announced at this time, with no change in the initial offer. With the U.S. dollar still lacking a price, the foreign exchange market gradually tightened, and buying interest was very strong. Except for small amounts, sellers were extremely scarce, and buyers were even more anxious. The initial quote for June U.S. dollars by banks was 34.25 yuan, gradually weakening to within 34 yuan, then rising to above 90 taels. Daxing Yong and Meng purchased continuously, and Qingfa Yong also bought a lot. The price gradually advanced. HSBC quoted June U.S. dollars at 33.5 yuan, then broke through the 700 tael mark, soaring rapidly with unlimited potential. Short covering and long speculation both occurred, with demand exceeding supply. June U.S. dollars even traded at 33.1875 yuan, which was still difficult to settle. The price surged to 707 taels and a half, and the mid-day close was 706 taels, a very sharp rebound. Within half a day, the short side was almost helpless, mainly because there were not many spot goods available. Most of the chips belonged to the spot goods opened by the Central Bank, and the shorts were afraid of unfavorable swap rates and even more afraid that the longs would not let go. If forced to settle at an unfavorable price, the consequences would be severe. Although there was no official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, there were rumors that the customs gold was used for settlement, leading to a rise in prices. Spot goods were scarce and demand was high, so the buyers were very active, with prices rising from 25 taels to 30 taels. The swap rate for March-April, which was offered by the shorts at 10 taels and 14.5 taels. Here is the record of the market conditions during the day. Morning Open: 687 taels, up 6 taels from the previous close. The opening price for goods was 6.5 taels. Exchange Market: The opening prices were both flat. The near-term offer for British exchange was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 8125, and for U.S. exchange, 33 yuan. It then retreated to 5.5 taels. Zhifeng Yong was the first to buy, and Macgary also quoted June U.S. dollars at 34.25 yuan. Fushun also came to buy, and it broke through the 90 tael mark. It was difficult to buy May U.S. dollars at 7, and Hengyu advanced to 92 taels. Retail investors sold a lot, then retreated to 89 taels. June U.S. dollars at 33.875 yuan was also difficult to settle. Qianchang Xiang pulled up to above 90 taels, and Daxing Yong came in aggressively, adding to 94 taels. However, because June U.S. dollars at 75 was difficult to sell, Yuansheng Yong and Zhifeng Yong both came to sell, breaking through 90 taels again. Hengyu sold even more, to 88 taels. At this time, it hovered slightly at the 90 tael mark. Xie Xing Yong bought, and although retail investors sold, in an instant, Banque Belge bought June U.S. dollars at 875. Daxing Yong advanced to 2 taels. Before long, June at 625 was difficult to settle. Daxing Yong and Zhaofeng Chang bought again, for 4 taels. Hengyu and Qianchang Xiang advanced to 6 taels. Macgary came out with May U.S. dollars at 25. Zhongfu also filled June at 625. Zhifeng Yong sold slightly, then dropped to 4 taels. Shengda took advantage of the low price to buy, and Qingfa Yong and Yuansheng Yong also bought. HSBC also quoted June U.S. exchange at 625, then it went to above 7 taels. Qianchang Xiang and Wanxing followed up vigorously, and suddenly it soared to 9 taels and 8 qian. Many who saw the high price sold, and the market situation began to waver. Fuchang and Dachen had sold out, and then fell to 4 taels and a half. Zhifeng Yong and Shengda both had limited purchases, and it rebounded again, reaching 8 taels. Citibank sold April U.S. dollars at 8125, Fuyu sold slightly, dropping to 5 taels and a half. HSBC continued to quote June U.S. dollars at half a yuan. Daxing Yong and Qingfa Yong bought continuously, and it rose to above 700 taels. Zaifeng Yong advanced to 1 tael.</p>
<p>After that, there was a struggle, and the market situation flourished, and people's hearts were greatly shaken, because Daxing Yong's buying interest was great, and it continuously purchased huge amounts. Generally, long positions took the opportunity to pick up sharply, and retail shorts saw that the situation was not good and reluctantly covered. The price of gold went forward bravely, and June U.S. dollars half a yuan could not be closed. Daxing Yong advanced to 2 taels, and Shengda suddenly came to buy again, for 4 taels. Goods were cashed out and for 2.5 taels. Macgary bought June U.S. exchange at 33.1875 yuan, rising to 5 taels. Dadecheng and Yuanmao Yong goods scrambled to sell,</p>
<p>then fell to 1.5 taels. Shengda still came to buy, and Hengyu also advanced, and the short covering surged even more, and there were many who reversed to long positions, so it rose to 6.5 taels. Fuyu, Zhaofeng Chang, and Yifeng Yong all sold, and it became 4 taels. At this time, June U.S. dollars had been done to 33.125 yuan. Zhifeng Yong advanced sharply, and in an instant it reached 707 taels and a half. Not long after, the mid-day close was 706 taels. In the afternoon, there was a triple zero market, and goods were auctioned at 5.5 taels. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 707 taels and a half, and the lowest price was 685 taels and a half, with a fluctuation of 22 taels, but the result was a sharp increase of 25 taels compared with the previous close. This month's registered price was 717 taels, and April's registered price was 706 taels. The replenishment price in the morning was 721 taels.</p>
<p>In the Market</p>
<p>Transaction demand exceeded supply. In total, Daxing Yong, Qingfa Yong, Shengda, Fushun, Qianchang Xiang, Xie Xing Yong, Yuan Xin Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, Yuan Heng, etc., all advanced. Fuyu, Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Yichang Hengyu, and Yifeng Yong, etc., all sold. There were few transactions from the Dalian gang, and the Guangdong gang was also small, but Shengda was slightly squeezed in. As of the day before yesterday, the total number of April contracts was 22,519.</p>
<p>Spot Goods</p>
<p>The market situation was still trance-like. Although the demand was strong, sellers were lacking. Initially, the planned price was plus 25 taels, and later buyers gradually increased it to above 30 taels. Qianchang Xiang and others were very eager for goods, but sellers were still unable to act.

<h3>Tightening Exchange Market</h3>

The near-term offer for British exchange was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 8125, and for U.S. exchange, 33 yuan. After the opening, it immediately tightened. Although there were several struggles, the trend was excellent. June U.S. dollars initially traded at 34.25 yuan, and gradually tightened, trading to within 34 yuan. Finally, it even traded to 33.1875 yuan. Banks were still buying, and some could still sell 125. Banks such as Andar and HSBC quoted U.S. dollars, while Banque Belge and Zhongfu sold.

<h3>Interest Rate Level, Money Tight</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign interest rates has remained stable in recent days, with little fluctuation to report. Since the standard price has been limited and cannot move freely, both longs and shorts have been restricted, resulting in no significant difference in the external price. The tightness of money is due to the fact that banks are collecting more deposits than they are releasing, causing a slight strain on working capital. The market conditions for all subsidiary currencies have generally fluctuated slightly, with no significant changes.</p>
<h3>Interest Rates</h3>
<p>"Foreign interest rates" in both the morning and afternoon markets remained at 7 qian 1 fen 4 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half, with no increase or decrease from the previous day. However, the opening trend was different from the appearance, and the content was exceptionally loose. "Money rates" were 3 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, slightly better than the previous day by 1 fen. There were still 6-7 fen market conditions for adding water to deposits.</p>

<p>Jiangnan small silver dollars were 6 qian 1 fen 8 li in the morning market, and fell by a small 2 li in the afternoon market to 6 qian 1 fen 6 li, with 9,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were 5 qian 8 fen 2 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half in both the morning and afternoon markets, a sharp drop of 2 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half compared to the previous day's afternoon market, with 45,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 10,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrunk by 500 wen to 422,000 wen.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Anxious Bond Market</p>
<p>▲The Financial World is Mostly Bullish</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market at the Chinese Securities Exchange still felt volatile, with unusually sensitive fluctuations and an unusually tortuous trend. Most of the time, retail investors were sometimes bullish and sometimes bearish, with frequent inflows and outflows, making the market price uncertain. However, on the bullish side, the financial world was mostly bullish, with a very strong defense, so the market price always rebounded once it declined a little. Yesterday's market, initially, was still mostly about covering short positions, mostly by retail investors. Issues No. 1 and No. 50 were in extremely high demand, so the opening price rose by several jiao, and the demobilization bonds rose sharply by eight jiao. In the second session, due to rumors of Zhang Xueliang's resignation, people were nervous, and there was some short selling in the market, and the northern gang also sold, so the price fell slightly by three to five jiao. In the afternoon, the situation changed again, and Issues No. 21 and No. 50 were still being bought, and 1919 and 1920 treasury bonds were also being purchased, so the aforementioned 18 issue demobilization bonds fell slightly by three to four jiao, and then unanimously rose by about three to five jiao. The closing price still rose sharply, rising another two to three jiao to six to seven jiao. However, because the long side of the 20th year bonds slightly settled, they showed a slight easing. In total, the result for the whole day, except for the 20 issue and the unified salt tax falling slightly by five fen to three to four jiao, the rest unanimously rose by one to two jiao to six to seven jiao. The market sentiment was quite good, and there was no sign of a sharp drop for the time being. Some people are looking at 42 yuan for salt tax, so let's wait and see. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 10,045,800 yuan, of which 18,000 yuan were spot goods. Futures accounted for 3,840,000 yuan for unified salt tax and 2,585,000 yuan for demobilization bonds. The remaining various types were mostly 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. There was a sudden transaction of 200,500 yuan for long-term financial assets.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Yarn Buyers' Attitude Turns Calm</p>
<p>Anticipating a Rising Trend in U.S. Cotton</p>
<p>The yarn market remains calm and the situation is extremely stable, but the environment is still poor, so new buyers have not increased. Actual sales in the market were stronger than yesterday, but large transactions were still inactive. Due to financial depletion and the intensifying Japanese invasion, yarn sales have been severely hit. As for the short side, because the base goods are too thick, they are sold off on rallies.</p>
<p>This Month's Yarn Rises Four Qian</p>
<p>In the pre-market opening, market sentiment rose slightly, and there were not many sellers in the market. The prices for each month rose by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 qian. The afternoon market situation was still flat, but in this month, the bank gang made arbitrage transactions, and the market momentum was higher for the near months, rising by 1 qian, and falling by 0.1 to 0.2 qian for the remaining months. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 11,750 bales. It was found that Dafeng sold 600 bales, Mingde 400 bales, Jifeng 400 bales, Changfeng 400 bales, and Yichang 800 bales.

<p>The cotton market rose slightly. Because gold prices rebounded and the U.S. exchange rate shrank, the market sentiment became firmer. The market became tighter. However, the Indian cotton market was extremely flat. In the afternoon, there was also cheap Indian cotton being traded, but it had no impact on the market. Generally, buyers' intentions were calm, with the expectation that U.S. cotton would rise. Some purchased more, and the future depends on the U.S. cotton opening.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Recovered Two Qian</p>
<p>Zheng Standard opened higher in the pre-market because the gold market stabilized,</p>
<p>and it was rumored that U.S. prices would definitely rise, so there were fewer short sellers, and the market situation was positive. The prices for each month rose by 0.1 to 0.2 qian. Although Indian cotton was traded in the afternoon, market sentiment was not affected, and the prices for each month rose by another 0.05 qian. The total transaction volume was 38,200 dan. It was found that Mingde sold 2,100 dan, Jifeng 1,700 dan, Tongxing 2,000 dan, Yuanda 3,100 dan, and Yuanxingchang 2,100 dan, and Ruiyuan 1,000 dan.

<h3>Xihe American Cotton Sales Are Brisk</h3>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>The Rice Market is Obstructed, and Transportation Has Become a Certainty</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) The boatmen's strike is at a stalemate, and the recent appetite has also declined, and the market price has fallen. Today, the store's appetite in the city and countryside is slightly better, but the merchants sell off the goods in the vehicles and warehouses at opportune moments, and the market situation is only superficially prosperous, with no significant difference in prices.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supply from the river still came to Shanghai from Xiaogang No. 2 and No. 3, and the car transportation continued to have a source of supply. White japonica rice sales were sluggish, causing the market to weaken by nearly a foot. Thin japonica and early japonica rice had poor sales, and the price was short by one or two jiao. Dujian was also tired by about a jiao. Yangbu customer tips are stable, and yin yuan is lacking. Baiyuan is stable.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Min Hua Is Still Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian Min Hua was still active. The Fuzhou gang had a relatively strong appetite, and the Quanzhou gang also asked about sales. Most people in this street are waiting and watching, but the arrival is reduced. Hunan rice milling machine oil machines are few in storage, and the price has risen by 0.7-0.8 fen. Jiangxi rice high-quality goods are looked at positively by 0.5 fen, but only medium and high-quality goods are sold in the market. If Ke Hua becomes more prosperous in the future, then the market must be leveled. A total of 1,700 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were sold, priced at 8 yuan and 6 jiao and a half to 8 yuan and 4 jiao and 3 fen. There were also 100 bags of machine cheap rice, priced at 7 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 fen, and 58 bags of machine red rice, priced at 8 yuan and 3 jiao and 8 fen. 553 bags of Hunan machine oil were priced at 8 yuan and 8 jiao to 8 yuan and a half, and 1,500 bags of machine red rice were priced at 8 yuan and 4 jiao and 8 fen to 8 yuan and 4 jiao. The local street office handled 500 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice and 400 bags of Hunan machine red rice, and the rest were handled by the Min gang.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour and Wheat are Generally Stable</h3>
<p>Flour Market: After the market opened in the morning, the prices for each month presented a generally flat and then stable trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Canadian wheat, fell back by about 0.3 yuan, and there was no market for sesame wheat, so the market was generally flat and tired when it first opened, falling below the previous day's closing price for the near term, and falling by 0.05 for the far term. However, after that, each session recovered to a high price, because the Guangdong gang had an appetite for each term, near and far, and the major factories were still holding firm, so the market atmosphere turned stable again. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment was quite good at the beginning, because the Guangdong gang intended to enter again, and this month had reached 0.08 yuan at one point. Then, because Fufeng sold short, the market turned flat again, and the prices for each month in the far term were hovering, with little fluctuation. As for spot goods, the news from Fujian was very tight, but the standard was not added, and the rest was still loose. As a result, each month from this month to June was better than the previous day by 0.025, and July and August were better by 0.05.</p>
<p>Wheat Market: After the market opened in the morning, the market for each month was generally flat because the quoted price of Canadian wheat fell by 0.3 yuan. The near term was sluggish and the far term was still stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was better for March and April because traders were replenishing, because some of the traders' arbitrage goods had been sold to the factories, so the standard price must be closed. The market atmosphere for each month in the far term was flat because the traders still had arbitrage sales. As a result, this month was better than the previous day by 0.01, April was better by 0.02, July was smaller by 0.01, and August was smaller by 0.02.</p>
<h3>Oil Rises a Qian and Soybean is Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market sales appetite was still healthy, and the cargo owners tightly held high prices, resulting in a reduction in the appetite. It is estimated that 400 pieces of soybean oil were traded, and the opening price was good and a half a qian. The sales of raw oil were slightly smooth, and 900 pieces were sold. Light skin oil was 1 qian higher than the previous market, and inter-warehouse oil was 2 qian higher because of the scarcity of goods. The sales appetite for factory soybean oil was unhealthy, and the market belonged to a draw. Soybean sales have been sluggish recently, and the market situation is still stable because of the thin goods. The factory's appetite is also weak. Yesterday, 2 cars of Zhengyangguan soybeans were traded in the market, and the remaining Mengcheng soybeans and Puzhou were handled by the Fuzhou office with 2 cars. The Tan City Soybean Inland Car Workshop traded one car. Qing Soybeans had few stocks, and the Xiamen Wen Taifu gang had inquiries, so the market was quite firm and stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>The Trend of Sugar is Still Falling</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the bullion market saw a rebound, the sales were still extremely light and the market situation was uncertain, and it was still falling. The Association's disk price for 24 rough sand white was 15 taels, 1 qian, and 2.5 fen, smaller than the previous day by 0.025. The 20 medium sand white had been thrown at a price for days, and the combined price was quite cheap. Yesterday, the market price was 14 taels and 4 qian, and the degree of fall was relatively large. The 8-9 Dutch red was priced at 11 taels and 7 qian and a half, and it also fell by 0.1 qian. The number of transactions was small. The foreign bank sold 200 tons of Dutch red for 6-7 months, with a price of 3.75 in Dutch currency. Dachang sold 150 tons of 20 medium sand white in April, with a price of 3.95 (all new regulations and foreign taxes). The appetite of each bank turned sparse, and there were no large transactions in Jinding. The original prices were slightly opened. The market prices of Chaoqing and Diaoqing were stagnant because the market was weak. In general, the market situation of each item has not yet stabilized for a while.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Citibank Hardware is Reduced Due to Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. exchange rate had reached more than 35 yuan, causing the market price of Citibank hardware stored in this port to be reduced. For example, green lead fell by 0.2 qian, and is now estimated at only 11 taels and 6 qian and a half. Citibank square nails fell by 0.5 qian, and sold for 10 taels. Galvanized iron also fell by 0.2 to 0.3 qian. Its price for No. 24 is estimated at 15 taels and 7 qian, No. 26 at 18 taels, No. 28 at 17 taels, and No. 31 at 15 taels. However, the transactions still do not see any progress. In addition, although tinplate and company iron, etc., have not been affected, the market sentiment has been softened a lot. The inquiries from fellow traders in recent days and the pricing of American goods have been continuous, but there has been no reply telegram. It is understood that the situation is more chaotic than in Shanghai. In addition, the British goods market is still stable, and the transactions of each goods on the north road have completely stopped, and the south road is also limited. Therefore, the market depends on the factory</p>
<h3>Coal</h3>
<p>Coal Purchased by Out-of-Town Merchants</p>
<p>Recently, the coal market has been active due to out-of-town merchants coming to Shanghai to purchase coal. Transactions have gradually increased, and market prices have trended favorably. Total transactions citywide included 800 tons of mixed bituminous coal, over 1,200 tons of coal dust, and over 730 tons of anthracite coal. Prices for mixed Boshan coal increased by 2.5 cents, lump coal increased by 4 cents, Jingxing lump coal increased by 3 cents, Datong coal dust increased by 1.5 cents, and Kaiping small lump coal also increased by 1 cent. Anthracite coal prices are said to be unstable.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Market Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bituminous coal market was extremely strong. The influx of out-of-town merchants purchasing coal caused prices to firm up sharply. Total spot transactions included 200 tons of Datong lump coal, and 100 tons of warehouse receipts, priced at 14.5 to 15 cents. Zhongxing lump coal saw 80 tons traded at 12.5 taels, and 130 tons of coal dust at 11 taels. Boshan mixed spot coal saw 250 tons traded at 10.02 taels, and 200 tons of warehouse receipts traded at 5 cents higher. 70 tons of East China lump coal traded at 8 taels.</p>
<h3>Market Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>The silver crisis in the United States has caused foreign exchange rates to lose their standards. Local foreign firms selling silk have therefore lost their basis for operation. European and American firms dare not engage in forward or spot silk transactions. There were no negotiations between Chinese and foreign parties. Only the Shanghai silk factory purchased 15 packages of top-grade "Park" brand white silk, grades 18 to 20, at a price of 510 taels per package. The British mail ship "Cowra" exported yesterday, with Jardine Matheson, Ewo, and other firms shipping out 154 bales of Chinese silk, including 97 bales to Britain and 57 bales to Britain for transfer to India.</p>
<p>Green tea, such as "Shi Zhuang" needle-eyebrow, "Mei E" eyebrow, and "Shrimp Eye," saw slight movement in the Moroccan market. Yesterday, EWO and China Tea Company purchased 643 boxes. Pearl tea sold from 35 to 51 taels. Eyebrow tea sold from 46 to 53 taels, and needle-eyebrow tea from 18 to 29 taels, establishing opening prices. However, high-grade eyebrow tea from "Lu Zhuang" was in greater demand.</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli has been experiencing sluggish sales recently, with large inventories remaining. Yesterday's selling price of the brand was 17.78 taels, a slight decrease of 0.34 taels compared to the previous price.</p>

<h3>Seeking Justice</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>The Lytton Report adopts the "International Cooperation for Development of China Plan" invented by the Chinese themselves.</p>
<p>This is worthy of gratitude - the recent telegram from all sectors of Nanjing City has "respectfully expressed sincere gratitude on behalf of the 700,000 people of Nanjing"</p>
<p>, calling him "not only a friend of China, but also a protector of world peace and humanitarian justice."</p>
<p>(March 1st, Nanjing Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>However, Lytton should also be grateful to China; first, if China did not have the "International Cooperation Theory," Sir Lytton would have found it difficult to find appropriate words to express his meaning. Isn't joint operation lacking a theoretical basis?</p>
<p>Second, as Sir Lytton himself said, "Nanjing could have welcomed Japanese assistance to resist the communist tide," he should express sincere respect for the painstaking efforts of the Chinese authorities in this regard.</p>
<p>However, Sir Lytton's recent speech in Paris (Reuters, Paris, February 20th) raised two questions: One is: "China's future seems to depend on how, when, and by whom such great human resources will be unified with national consciousness, Geneva or Moscow?" The other is: "China now leans towards Geneva, but if Japan insists on its current policy and Geneva fails, then China, even against its will, will change its orientation." These two questions are somewhat insulting to China's national character. The state is the government. Lytton said that China does not yet have "a unified force of national consciousness," and may even change its orientation towards Geneva! Isn't this distrustful of the Chinese state's loyalty to the League of Nations and its painstaking efforts towards Japan?</p>
<p>For the sake of China's national dignity and national glory, we have wanted to answer Sir Lytton for many days, but we lacked the appropriate documents. This is very distressing. Today, we suddenly discovered a treasure in the newspaper that can be used to answer Sir Lytton: this is the "Announcement of the Hankou Police Department on March 1st." Here, we can find "ironclad facts" to refute Sir Lytton's suspicion.</p>
<p>For example, this announcement (original text in the Hankou Special Dispatch of Shen Bao on March 1st) says: "Laborers working under foreign capital, if there are legitimate issues between labor and capital that remain unresolved, should report to our competent authorities for negotiation or assistance, and must not directly negotiate. Violators will be arrested, or those who are exploited to deliberately create serious situations through such means will be executed." This means that foreign capitalists can directly handle "legitimate issues that remain unresolved between labor and capital at will, while laborers who do so" will be executed. In this way, we Chinese are only left with laborers "unified by national consciousness" because anyone who violates this "consciousness" will be asked to leave China's "nation" and go to the underworld. Can Sir Lytton still say that the Chinese authorities do not have "a unified force of national consciousness?"</p>
<p>Furthermore, the one who unifies this "unified force" is of course Geneva, not Moscow. "China now leans towards Geneva" - this is what Sir Lytton himself said. Our tendency is extremely firm. For example, the announcement also says: "If there are treacherous people and vagrants who are induced, bought, or colluded with, or directly driven, or falsely claim to destroy order and tranquility, or constitute other major crimes that are detrimental to our country and society, they will be executed without mercy." This is a resolute measure to protect the "Geneva orientation," the so-called "not hesitating to shed blood." Moreover, "Geneva" is about world peace, so China has not resisted for two years because resistance would undermine peace; even in the January 28th Incident, China only pretended to block bombs and guns; in the recent Rehe Incident, China has also been "shortening the line." Not only that, but China has been focusing on suppressing bandits, having announced that it will eliminate the bandits and communists within a month or two, temporarily ignoring Rehe. All of this is to prove that "Japan ...... seeing the communist tide rising in southern China, can very well avoid taking action itself. China is working so hard and patiently,</p>
<p>Anxiety for which" is unnecessary. Japan is simply trying to move Japan to repent and achieve the goal of permanent peace in the Far East, where international capital can cooperate in division of labor. And Sir Lytton still suspects that China will "change its orientation." This is too unfair. In short, "execution, no mercy," is a historical document answering Sir Lytton's doubts. Please rest assured, please help.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>The situation is tense, and reading the newspaper is particularly enthusiastic and careful. Here are a few aphorisms seen in the newspaper in the past three days, which are interpreted in the spirit of 'chewing the roots of the Four Books'. ㈠ On March 5th at 3 p.m., Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, said to reporters at his private residence on Columbia Road in Shanghai: "Rehe is a natural barrier, and the defending army has more than 100,000 soldiers. Although the central government knows that the result will be defeat, no matter what, it believes that it should be able to support it for at least two or three months. I heard that Zhang Hanxiang also said to people that the term was two months. During this period, it is enough to give our representatives in Geneva an opportunity to work hard so that the international community can develop more powerfully to sanction Japan. Unexpectedly, the war lasted less than ten days..." (See the Shen Bao on the 6th)</p>
<p>Note: "This means that although the central government knows that Rehe is a natural barrier, and it cannot be said that it is not heavily guarded with more than 100,000 soldiers, this natural barrier and heavy army can only be defended for two or three months. After two or three months, the central government expects to fail. This is not only the opinion of the central government, but Zhang Hanxiang's long-term resistance is also for a period of two months. So, why did the central government and Zhang Hanxiang prepare to resist Japan for up to two months? This is because they want the Chinese delegation in Geneva to have an opportunity to work hard. One side supports, and the other side works hard, so the international community will have a more powerful development of sanctions against Japan. So, at that time, we will not prevent being defeated. But unexpectedly..."</p>
<p>㈡ Zhang Ji said in Xuzhou: "The Japanese invaders' artillery fire is not to be feared. Within ten years, there will be a major revolution in Japan." (See the Da Wan Bao on the 7th)</p>
<p>Note: "This is very reassuring for us. Because within ten years, there will be a major revolution in Japan, and at that time, Japanese imperialism will naturally disappear. Although we are currently eating a little of their artillery fire, it is nothing strange. At most, we can endure it for ten years, and their artillery fire will not be able to be directed at us. Extending this meaning, all imperialists who invade China can be feared. Because within ten years, the imperialists all over the world will inevitably collapse. Why should we resist and overthrow them?"</p>
<p>Another note: "Mr. Zhang Ji's words can have two interpretations. If Mr. Zhang means: "Japanese artillery fire is not to be feared. Within ten years, there will be a major revolution in Japan, which is terrible." Amitabha, good, good!"</p>
<p>㈢ Sun Dianying telegraphed the Beijing office, saying: "......Since the fourth, wind and snow have been raging, sometimes sweating profusely, and sometimes freezing all over. No bullets are acceptable for hand-to-hand combat, and no food is indeed pitiful. In short, if God saves China, Rehe must be saved. If God saves Rehe, our army must be saved......" (See the Shi Bao Morning Edition on the 7th)</p>
<p>Note: "It is true that the wind and snow are raging, causing the body to freeze all over. But why sometimes sweating profusely? There is doubt that the text is extended. No bullets are acceptable for hand-to-hand combat, and horizontally and vertically the same thing is to fight. What if there is no food? Said to be pitiful, pitiful then there is food even if there is no food. This does not matter for the time being, chewing on words is unnecessary, in short, the success or failure of this anti-Japanese war is up to God. If God means to save China, then China, Rehe, and "our army" can rest easy, without bullets or food, it does not matter. Otherwise, "our army" will be defeated, no need to help, because Rehe will inevitably be lost. If Rehe is lost, there is no need to retreat to the rear defense and prepare for a counterattack, because the entire China is</p>
<p>Sure to be destroyed. This is the anti-Japanese logic. However, the fact now is that Rehe has already been lost. From this point of view, China has already been destroyed, and General Sun's "our army" must have ceased to exist long ago."</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>In the past, if someone asked me, "Where does your home live?"</p>
<p>I could immediately answer, "My home is in Jilin."</p>
<p>If asked how many people were in my family, I could also clearly say, "Six people, father, mother, sister-in-law, younger sister, nephew, and me."</p>
<p>But now, it's not like that at all. If someone asks me the same question now, I will definitely have to think about it.</p>
<p>"My home?" Wait a moment, let me think... "My home is probably still on Earth, if the people in my family are still wearing it." Then I would say, "As for how many people are still in the family, I can only</p>
<h3>The Black Girl's Prayer to God (22)</h3>
<p>— George Bernard Shaw, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"Bah!" said the sculptor. "Your God is a novice, and he knows it himself. I</p>
<p>In the corner of my stall tent, there are several Greek gods who are so beautiful that even God himself would be jealous when he compares them with his own unskilled works. I tell you, if God really has any hands, it is because his own hands are too clumsy that he created my hands. The artist's god is such an artist himself that he is never satisfied with his work, and always makes it as complete as he can, always aware that although he must stop when he reaches that limit, there is still further completion beyond that, without which it is like water without meaning. Your God can create women, can he create the goddess of love?</p>
<p>Impossible: only artists can do it. Look!" he said, standing up and walking into the stall, "Could God have created him?" So he took a white stone Venus from the corner of the tent and placed it on the counter.</p>
<p>"His hands and feet are cold," said the black girl, who had been listening intently, and no one noticed her. "You said it well!" said the Arab. "A living failure is better than a dead masterpiece; this proves that God is right."</p>
<p>It was right to oppose this extremely arrogant idolater, and if you hadn't killed him with one sentence, I would have killed him with one knife."</p>
<p>"I'm still alive," said the artist, not ashamed at all. "That girl's hands and feet will one day be colder than any white</p>
<p>Stone is still cold. Cut my goddess in two; she's still white stone at the root. Cut that girl in two with your scimitar and see what happens."</p>
<p>"I'm no longer interested in your words," said the Arab. "Young lady; my house can accommodate another wife. You are beautiful, your skin is like black satin; you are lively."</p>
<p>"How many wives do you have?" said the black girl.</p>
<p>"I haven't counted for a long time," the Arab replied; "but so many are enough to make you understand that I am an experienced husband who knows how to make women happy in the way that God allows."</p>
<p>With a resolute say, there is one of me" - I can no longer say about father, mother... because I really don't know if the five of them are still alive! Then, the question comes again, how can one talk about "home"? That's right, then I might as well say it happily: "I have no home"!</p>
<p>Perhaps my five family members are still alive, then I must thank God, thank God for taking care of them alive. Because if they can still live, it must be said that it is "divine help."</p>
<p>But such "divine help" will not exist. Because God has not yet created eyes to look after the poor, and has always refused to stretch out his two divine hands to the poor. What's more, based on the facts, it is difficult for them to escape the disaster of death. The reason is that the Kwantung Army of Japanese imperialism, in the three eastern provinces, in Jilin, in my hometown of Jinjiatun, a small village, in order to thoroughly solve their thorn in the flesh, the people's volunteer army, all the latest killing weapons of 1933 have been used in this small village. My hometown has long been destroyed, and the result of my home can be imagined.</p>
<p>From the conversations of some people from my hometown, from some records, I heard and saw the words and news of the village being bombed and the villagers being brutally killed. As for what I hoped to hear or see: "Some refugees escaped during the bombing," but I was expecting it in vain. Isn't this a clear proof? Isn't this very easy to infer?</p>
<p>So, I say, my home is gone, it must be gone. But just my one home, that is so small - what does it matter whether it exists or not! However, at the same time, when I think of a group of people in the world suffering the same misfortune of family destruction as me, this makes me very sad!</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Paris (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fusheng</p>
<p>But there are also some diligent students among the students in Paris. I can boldly say that science students are more diligent. - This is not because I study science myself, so I am promoting science, but because science students always need something real and cannot be tricked. The second is liberal arts. Liberal arts students can be divided into three types; the first type is those who take the master's degree (Licence) examination with French students, and these people, like science students, have to be diligent. The second type is those who despise degrees and devote themselves to studying something they are interested in, regardless of everything; these people certainly have their own special opinions and courage, which are worthy of our admiration. The second type is those who are confused and don't understand anything, and their purpose is only to get a school's doctorate diploma to deceive people when they return; these people are the most boring. Honestly speaking, there are many doctoral graduates in literature who are now university professors in China, and I believe they cannot even write a clear French letter. I know a young master from Jiangsu who arrived in Paris three years later than me and returned to Shanghai two years earlier than me. He did not live in France for a total of three years and was already a doctor of philosophy and brought back a beautifully printed doctoral thesis that was three inches thick! This really has to be said to be a genius - I heard that this genius doctor is now also working as a professor in some university.</p>
<p>After talking for a long time, I haven't mentioned law. The situation of law students is probably similar to that of liberal arts. Those who take the master's degree examination with French students have something to offer. (But this is limited to the master's degree from the University of Paris. As for the universities set up in the provinces, because there is a kind of law master's degree specially given to foreigners, Chinese people flock to it like flies chasing carrion, which is as funny and ridiculous as the school doctorate of the University of Paris.)</p>
<p>In addition to students studying abroad, there are also hundreds of workers and businessmen in Paris now. Most of the workers came during the war, and some married French women and don't want to return home. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the world economic panic, factories around Paris have been rejecting foreign workers everywhere, and many Chinese workers have become extremely poor. The reason why they have not starved to death is because they have extraordinary patience - they often do twice as much work as the French but get half the wages. Among these workers, many have very rich factory experience and are skilled in technology. If they can be called back to China and work as instructors in domestic factories, I believe they will definitely be better than those technicians who have just graduated from school.</p>
<p>Speaking of businessmen, that's really pitiful! In Paris, except for a few small antique shops and small sundries shops, the only businesses run by Chinese people are restaurants. Therefore, the businessmen among the Chinese in Paris, when analyzed, are only antique shop owners, sundries shop owners, restaurant owners, and... and some Qingtian merchants who sell Japanese goods. It's a long story about Qingtian merchants, and their scope of activity is not limited to Paris, so I would like to describe them in another article later, not here.</p>

<p>(Beiping) The fierce battle at Qing Shi Liang outside Gubeikou continued all day today, and the enemy did not succeed. However, Tokyo issued a telegram this morning saying that the Japanese army occupied Gubeikou at noon on the 8th, which is a baseless rumor. It is hoped that the rumor will disrupt our rear. The official has solemnly denied it, and the Gubeikou telephone was still connected without incident until 10 PM at night. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, a special correspondent from Reuters in Gubeikou telegraphed that Gubeikou was still in the hands of the Chinese army.

<p>Sun Dianying's Troops</p>
<h3>Repeatedly Repel Strong Enemies</h3>
<p>Ammunition and Supplies Transported to the Front</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 41st Army of General Sun Dianying repeatedly repelled the Motegi cavalry brigade in the Weichang area of Rehe. Therefore, since yesterday, the enemy has added the Raita Brigade and more than 10,000 puppet troops to launch a fierce attack on the positions of our Liu Brigade. After General Sun personally supervised the battle, morale was strong and the enemy was repelled. The Beiping Military Commission has made arrangements to transport ammunition and supplies from Zhangjiakou and other places. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying's representative, Lu Hongkui, reported to the Military Commission on the 9th that the army was isolated in the isolated area and the situation was critical. He requested that the army be supplied with funds and ammunition as soon as possible so that it could do its best to resist Japan. The Military Commission is actively planning to supply Sun's army, but the exact method is being requested from Chairman Chiang. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Talk from Zhang Xueliang's Confidant</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Failure of Rehe</h3>
<p>Complex Army Makes Command Difficult; Zhang Willing to Serve as the Vanguard</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's confidant said that the reasons for the failure of Rehe were: First, the mistake was the lack of an overall defense plan. The issues of mutual reliance, transportation, and supply between the central government and local governments were not perfectly resolved. The armies were not aligned front and rear due to various relationships and failed to reach their missions. Second, the politics in Rehe were too bad, and the people had long lost their hearts. Third, the army system was complex and command was difficult. Zhang was extremely angry about the loss of Rehe, and the entire Northeast Army regarded it as a great shame. Zhang's resignation was sincere. If the central government cannot send someone to take over for the time being, he is willing to mobilize all the basic troops of the Northeast Army to take charge of the frontal battle and serve as the vanguard, sign a military order, and can limit the date to restore Chengde. He is unwilling to take charge of rear work and dare not act as chairman again. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Martial Law Implemented in Tangshan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Tangshan, because it is an industrial area, has thieves and communists lurking, and martial law has been implemented. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>National Government Issues Orders to the Yuan and Hui</p>
<h3>Arresting and Prosecuting Tang Yulin</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government has issued orders separately to the Executive Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission, and according to the telegram from the Minister of Military Administration, He Yingqin, on the 5th, Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province and concurrently Commander of the Third Army Corps, abandoned Chengde, impacting the war situation. He requested that Tang be dismissed from his position and severely punished. Based on this, it is found that Tang Yulin held an important position on the frontier and commanded troops, but he was cowardly and abandoned his post, delaying military affairs. This is deeply regrettable. Therefore, in addition to issuing a clear order to strip him of his position and issuing separate orders, the Executive Yuan is ordered to swiftly conduct a thorough investigation, arrest him, and prosecute him, to maintain national discipline. This order. (Special telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>The Government Closely Guards</p>
<h3>Japanese Soft Policy</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The government has received reports that an individual named Araki, a Japanese national who changed his nationality to Huang Mu, organized the East Asia Ethnic Alliance, adopting a soft policy to buy off idle Chinese military officers and frivolous politicians, attempting to cause disturbances. Orders have been issued to various locations to maintain close vigilance. (Special telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese War Expenses for Invading Rehe</h3>
<p>Araki Says No Need to Increase</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In response to questioning in the Fourth Subcommittee of the House of Peers, Army Minister Araki stated that, based on the current situation, the army does not need to request an increase in war expenses for Rehe. Araki also answered another question, stating that he does not see any difficulties in the merger of the Japanese and [Manchukuo] armies. Subsequently, Baron Sakamoto asked whether it was true that the Chinese army in Rehe used poison gas. Araki replied that, after investigation, he knew this statement was baseless. (Reuters telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu Osaka telegram, 9th. Regarding the secret transport of salt as material for Zhang Xueliang to manufacture poison gas, the Osaka military is investigating. It is questionable whether Shima Tokuzo was unaware of the inside story and only provided funds. Shima was summoned and interrogated today. (Harbin) Japanese newspapers reported that the authorities have decided to allocate land near the racecourse for residents on the left bank of the Songhua River to build houses and live in, to avoid flooding. The area is large enough for 2,000 households and will be distributed by lottery. Anyone affected by the floods can join the lottery after paying regular fees to the Land Bureau.

<p>Embargo on Arms Problem</p>
<h3>Progressive French Attitude</h3>
<p>▲ Havas Paris telegram, 8th. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon, chaired by former Prime Minister Herriot, leader of the Radical Party (i.e., the current ruling party), and passed a motion requesting the government to immediately negotiate with other countries in Geneva for a joint embargo on arms. Whenever disputes arise between countries and have been submitted to the League of Nations for review according to Articles 12 and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, if the disputing country refuses to accept the recommendations made by the League of Nations, all countries should jointly prohibit the transportation of all arms to that country. ▲ Reuters London telegram, 8th. A representative of the Department of Commerce stated in Parliament that the arms export ban imposed on China and Japan does not apply to aircraft or any aircraft engines.</p>
<h3>Japan Again Purchases Ships from Britain</h3>
<p>Total of Sixteen Ships Purchased in February</p>
<p>(London) It is learned today that Japan has purchased another four steamships from Britain. In February, Japan has purchased a total of sixteen ships from Britain. Except for two ships, all others are to be dismantled. The recently purchased ships are the Peninsula, the Orient, and the Batya, each weighing 6,000 tons, and the Glen Line's Glen Hill, weighing 6,498 tons, as well as the Canadian steamship Canada Inventor, weighing 5,497 tons, and the Canadian Navigator, weighing 5,384 tons. The two Canadian ships are intended for transport, while the others will be dismantled. The Batya and Glen Hill are each priced at £10,500. (Reuters telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>British Industrialists</p>
<h3>Mobilize to Resist Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Decided to Increase Tariffs</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun reported that British industrialists, in order to resist the import of Japanese goods, are fundamentally seeking to reduce domestic labor costs and increase tariffs. However, reducing labor costs is proving difficult in practice. They have decided to adopt the second measure, increasing tariffs. Currently, cotton industry stakeholders and silk associations advocate that tariffs on Japanese goods imported into Britain and its colonies should be increased across the board. It is found that last year, the total value of Japanese goods imported into Britain and its territories of British India, Canada, the Straits Settlements, the Union of South Africa, East Africa, and Australia exceeded 397,210,000 yuan, an increase of 50% over the previous year. In particular, in the cotton textile industry, where competition between Britain and Japan is most intense, British goods are almost overwhelmed by Japanese goods. For example, Japanese goods sales in China were 194, while British sales were only 125; Japanese goods sales in India were 645, while British sales were 599; in the Dutch East Indies, Japanese sales were 352, while British sales were only 44; in Africa, Japanese sales were 232, while British sales were 283. Since the boycott of Japanese goods in China, exports to China have decreased, but the penetration of Japanese cotton cloth into British spheres of influence has increased, greatly impacting British goods. As a result of Japanese goods' competitive dumping, the British industry has experienced a major panic. Therefore, both the British authorities are actively seeking to resist Japanese goods, and the most affected industrialists cannot remain silent and watch the industry decline. They have recently mobilized British industrialists to prevent the import of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador</p>
<h3>To Depart for China Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Passports for Soviet, Ma, etc. Can Also Be Issued</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, will depart on the 10th and is expected to arrive in Beijing on the 20th. The passports for Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, He Shengda, Wang Delin, Zhang Dianjiu, and their entourage of 28 people returning to their country have been processed after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the Soviets and Yan Huiqing consulted with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov nearby. There are no more problems in issuing the passports, and they can depart soon, passing through Germany and France, and then returning to China by ship from Paris. After landing in Shanghai, they will report to the capital and then head north. (Special telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Transferring to Nanjing to Report Everything</p>
<p>Inconvenient to Express Anything for the Time Being</p>
<p>Whether to Return to Japan is Up to the Government</p>
<p>Minister to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, and his wife, along with embassy secretary Ding Shaoji and two attendants, arrived in Shanghai this morning at 1:00 AM on the President Cleveland of the Da Lai Company. They docked at the Pujiang Baijing Wharf. Due to the late hour, the Da Lai Company's ferry did not depart from the Xin Guan Wharf to pick up passengers until 7:00 AM this morning. The Shanghai Municipal Government specially sent Commissioner Wang Changchun, Councilor Yin Rugeng, and Secretary Tang Shixuan to Pujiang at 6:30 AM this morning on a small Public Security Bureau ferry to welcome them. At 8:15 AM, Mr. and Mrs. Jiang boarded the welcoming ferry and landed at the Xin Guan Wharf. Central Committee member Zhang Qun, Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang of the Foreign Affairs Office, and others all went to the wharf to greet them. Mr. Jiang immediately returned to his residence on Rue Lafayette in the same car with Zhang Qun. When reporters from this newspaper went to visit him this morning, Mr. Jiang said that regarding the China-Japan issue and everything else, it was really inconvenient for him to express anything before going to Nanjing to discuss with the government. He then said that due to the fatigue of the journey, the Minister Jiang and his wife would rest for a while in Shanghai for a day or two and then go to Nanjing to report to the central government. When reporters asked about the time of his return to Japan, he said that everything would depend on the government's orders, and he had no preconceived notions. He would temporarily rest in his Shanghai residence. In addition, Xin Sheng She reported that when reporters asked Mr. Jiang about the situation in Japan this morning on the ship, Mr. Jiang said that it was a big mistake for Chinese people to think that Japan's economy was heading towards bankruptcy and hoped that it would collapse on its own. Economic panic is a common phenomenon in the world and not unique to Japan. The low exchange rate of the yen is beneficial to exports because Japan is a country with a trade surplus, and a low exchange rate can reduce the prices of goods exported to foreign countries. In recent years, Japanese goods have sold very well in the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, which can be used as evidence. The United States has suspended foreign exchange, and Japan is slightly affected, far less than the countries in the Americas.

<p>Colombian-Peruvian Dispute</p>
<h3>League of Nations Also Decides to Report</h3>
<p>Peru's Reply Displeases the League of Nations</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Geneva telegram, 8th. The League of Nations is now engaged in the serious process of preparing a report based on Article 15 of the Covenant. This is because Peru's reply is unsatisfactory. The League of Nations has a proposal to peacefully resolve the dispute between Colombia and Peru over the town of Leticia, but Peru's response is unsatisfactory, so the League of Nations is taking this step. It is found that since its establishment, the League of Nations has prepared reports twice, the first time on the Vilnius dispute in 1921, and the second time on the Far East conflict half a month ago. The League of Nations Executive Council's handling of the South American dispute is quite nimble. It is said that the League of Nations' handling of the Far East incident was delayed for a long time, causing the world to have the impression that the League of Nations was inefficient. Therefore, those who support the League of Nations now urgently want to eliminate this bad impression and test the possibility of the Covenant, and are handling South America with a more rapid hand.</p>
<p>▲ Havas Geneva telegram, 8th. Regarding the dispute between Peru and Colombia, the Peruvian government has submitted a counter-proposal to the League of Nations, but its content is unacceptable to the League of Nations Executive Council and Colombia. This afternoon, the Executive Council, according to the proposal of the three-member committee, submitted the Peruvian counter-proposal for review and allowed the three-member committee to immediately draft a report in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant. However, the Executive Council decided that the mediation procedure stipulated in Article 15, paragraph 3 of the Covenant must wait until the Executive Council passes the report on Wednesday and Thursday of next week before it can be considered concluded. This is the same procedure as that undergone in the Far East dispute.</p>
<p>▲ Havas Geneva telegram, 8th. After listening to the opinions of the representatives of Bolivia and Paraguay, the League of Nations Executive Council entrusted a three-member committee to formally visit the governments of Argentina and Chile on the solution proposed by them. The Executive Council then held a closed-door meeting to discuss how to handle the proposal of Britain and France to prohibit the transportation of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay. Representatives of all countries believed that the Executive Council should make a list of countries that could not be invited to participate as a basis, and then proceed with the contact, but the discussion was very difficult because the Italian representative constantly raised reservations, making it impossible for the meeting to progress.</p>

<h3>[Down with Moscow]</h3>
<p>Berlin Police Violently Assault Americans</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Berlin telegram, 8th. An American was beaten by auxiliary police of the National Socialist Party on a street in Berlin, and in recent days, Americans have often been insulted on the road. Therefore, the American Ambassador to Berlin, [blank], Kate, protested to the German Foreign Minister today. The German Foreign Minister has replied with an apology and promised to find a way to prevent such incidents. The information office of the National Socialist Party said that the perpetrators must be communists impersonating National Socialists, aiming to damage the reputation of the National Socialist Party abroad. Shops opened by Jews in the Ruhr area had to close down because the National Socialist Party Storm Troopers held signs outside the door saying [Germans should buy German goods], preventing customers from entering the stores. Tens of thousands of schoolchildren were given a day off today to celebrate Hitler's election victory. [Blank] sang the National Socialist Party anthem and marched through the streets of Berlin. When they passed in front of the Soviet Embassy, they shouted [Down with Moscow].</p>

<h3>Disarmament Conference Nearly Dead</h3>
<p>Japan's Plans Will Have Significant Changes</p>
<p>Britain Proposes to Stop the Arms Race for Five Years</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Geneva telegram, 8th. The Japanese delegation to the Disarmament Conference informed the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, today that Japan will continue to participate in the Disarmament Conference, but the Japanese representatives said that due to the changes in the Far East situation, Japan's national defense plan will have significant changes. All of this should be taken into account when discussing disarmament in the future. ▲ Reuters Paris telegram, 8th. Discussions between Britain and France on the difficult problem of disarmament will begin on Friday. On the same day, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon will have lunch with French Prime Minister Daladier regarding army deployments. They will first discuss it briefly, and then go to Japan to review it. If the British Prime Minister proposes to stop the arms race for five years, how will the French government respond to it? The French government has made no indication of this. The main obstacle to the disarmament process encountered by France is still the demand for immediate equality in armaments put forward by Germany. However, France can certainly agree to the establishment of a temporary convention, listing all the points that have already been agreed upon and acknowledging Germany's demands in principle. At the same time, judging from the general opinion circles in France, the British authorities may not receive a warm welcome. Public opinion believes that the Disarmament Conference is now on the verge of death, and Geneva can no longer achieve anything. The Liberty Daily said that Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary are all opposed to France. Instead of going to Geneva to be caught in the spider web set up by Italy and Germany, it is better to stay at home and guard its own spider web. The Debate Daily does not agree with the British proposal for a five-year arms truce, saying that it will only make France and other peaceful countries lag behind and allow the Hitler government to replenish the strength of its national defense forces and Italy to continue to supply Hungary with armaments.</p>
<p>US Government</p>
<h3>Will Issue Currency</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters Washington telegram, 8th. Official sources said that the US government plans to issue a kind of [blank] currency to replace the previously planned money notes or clearinghouse bills. Treasury Secretary Woodin claimed today that the expansion of currency can replace a large portion of the $7,250,000,000 of currency that has already been issued but is being hoarded. Halfway through the official news, the currency can be legally increased by $3,000,000,000, and is based on the existing gold reserve. Currently, the total cash in the United States is worth about $4,250,000,000, of which more than $1,000,000,000 is almost in circulating currency, so the government now has about $3,000,000,000 in cash to offset current and future banknotes. ▲ Reuters Washington telegram, 8th. It is now learned that President Roosevelt will continue to prohibit gold exports after the 9th of this month.</p>
<p>He will also ask Congress on Thursday to allow him to exercise dictatorial power over banks and finances until permanent legislation is established. It is heard that the President's proposition is that all cash in the country should be stored in the treasury before the gold tide can be managed. In his report to the country, Roosevelt will recommend reorganizing various parts of the government so that the budget can be balanced. ▲ Reuters New York telegram, 8th. It is reported that New York banks today paid out more than 10 million yuan in wages and necessary purchases approved by Treasury Secretary Woodin. ▲ Havas Washington telegram, 8th. President Roosevelt originally planned to ask Congress for the passage of several permanent laws for the banking system at the special meeting of Parliament on Thursday. According to reliable sources, Roosevelt has abandoned this proposal, but he requires Congress to grant him powers similar to dictatorship, so that he can respond to the development of the situation at any time. It is also heard that Roosevelt has decided not to issue universal tickets until the circulation of currency returns to normal, but local governments may still issue them. Treasury Secretary Woodin claimed that he intends to issue a kind of "real banknotes." The general public expects that Roosevelt will maintain the cash export ban and exchange restriction measures. ▲ Havas New York telegram, 8th. Official sources are making great efforts to make private gold deposits re-enter the banks. Some people suggested the following methods, namely: ㈠ Impose heavy taxes on private gold deposits. ㈡ Publicly announce the names of gold depositors. ㈢ Announce that cash transactions are illegal. The value of platinum has skyrocketed due to speculators' currency requirements.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Political Situation in Germany (Berlin Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Hitler's swastika flag signifies that the National Socialist Party he leads does not belong to capitalism, nor does it belong to communism, but is moving towards the Third Reich. He advocates refusing to pay reparations, advocating equal armament, demanding the revision of national borders, and loudly proclaiming Germany's "self-reliance," thus winning the sympathy of most intellectuals and young people, and university students in their twenties.</p>
<p>Those who were eighteen years old when the European War declared an armistice in 1918 are now thirty-two years old. There are as many as 13.6 million young men and women between the ages of twenty and thirty-two with the right to vote. If another seven or eight years pass, there will be more than 21 million young people who have not experienced war, which will account for half of the voters.</p>
<p>Whether these young people are members of the National Socialist Party or the Communist Party, they are all indignant and rebellious because Germany was defeated in the war and is still being punished. The National Socialist Party wants to follow in Italy's footsteps and declare the "Treaty of Versailles" invalid by force. The Communist Party wants to establish a Soviet Germany, then the "Treaty of Versailles" will inevitably be invalid. Although the means are different, the goal of using strength to break the international status quo is the same.</p>
<p>In particular, the members of Hitler's party are convinced that they are the outstanding members of the German nation. They want to use their intellectual power and solidarity to break the status quo and restore national prestige, and even more to advocate cooperation with Italy, Hungary, and Austria, which will further boost the morale of the German people.</p>
<p>The reason for the decline of the Centre Party and the Social Democratic Party is that they are content with the status quo, do not eulogize the old imperial regime, and accommodate reality, so they are willing to succumb to the iron chains of the "Treaty of Versailles," thus gradually losing popular support. Young people who are right-leaning follow Hitler, and young people who are left-leaning join or sympathize with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party was originally an organization centred on industrial workers. After the Great War, it was very dominant. In its heyday, it had 180 seats in parliament. However, it later lost its popular base due to unemployment, lukewarm social policies, and failure to grasp the masses. Therefore, its masses were gradually eroded by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>The Centre Party is an organization of Catholics, and its constituent members include capitalists and workers. In general, they all follow the trend and do not have active guiding principles. However, they support the Weimar Constitution and advocate democracy and republicanism. If times change and the situation changes, and there is a restoration, it will not resolutely oppose it.</p>
<p>The above two factions were the dominant political parties before January of this year, so Hitler's cabinet still had to rope in von Papen.</p>
<p>The constituent members of the German National People's Party are large landowners, capitalists, and the descendants of landlords, nobles, and officers. They have a strong intention to restore the imperial system, but their strength is limited.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party led by Hitler is centred on self-cultivating farmers, white-collar workers, and small capitalists. It vigorously opposes democracy and advocates dictatorship. It is ambiguous about the restoration of the imperial system, especially the restoration of the "Hohenzollern" dynasty, and it also secretly joins hands with capitalists, so it has a huge momentum and wants to dominate all of Germany.</p>
<p>The combination of the above two parties has the potential to overthrow the Social Democratic Party and suppress the Centre Party. Although the Centre Party has expressed its willingness to cooperate with Hitler, the democratic system is always incompatible with it.</p>
<p>In addition, the Communist Party stands in absolute opposition to them. Its constituent members are mainly unemployed workers and wandering intellectuals. Although it strives to break the status quo in Germany, it ultimately fails to gain the dominant power of the absolute majority. However, it is probably impossible to completely eliminate it.</p>
<p>Hitler is indeed loudly proclaiming the revival of Germany and suppressing the Communist Party, but more than 5.7 million unemployed workers have no work. Even if Alsace-Lorraine and Upper Silesia and overseas colonies are taken back today, there is still no way to solve the problem. Moreover, the economic program he holds is the same as the program of the Papen cabinet, saying that it will save Germany, but in fact it will not have much effect. However, if he can get the understanding of the financial capitalists of Britain and France, he can use the army and police to defeat the Communist Party internally, and in the future he can conquer the Centre Party and the National People's Party. Externally, he will be close to Britain and France, estranged from the Soviet Union, and of course, he will be closer to Italy. The party that uses state power will of course win the general election on March 5, but the Communist Party will not disappear, and the Social Democratic Party will remain in its original state.

<h3>Leading Old Troops to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Pawning Family Property to Serve as Military Expenses,</p>
<p>Swearing an Oath in Jiexiu and Immediately Heading to Rehe,</p>
<p>(Also Assuming the Position of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army).</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Fang Zhenwu, former Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, has been recuperating in Shanghai since last year and has not been heard from in politics for a long time. Recently, in view of the urgency of the national crisis, he has been sincerely urged by his former subordinates, Bao Gang and Zhang Renjie. He resolutely pawned his family property for about 150,000 yuan, and went to Shanxi with the money at the end of last month. He reorganized the approximately 20,000 people of Bao and Zhang's troops into the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. On the first of this month, he swore an oath in Jiexiu and issued a telegram to assume the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. He departed from Jiexiu and Xiaoyi on the same day. Zhang's troops have now arrived at Dongyangguan, and Bao's troops have arrived at Qinzhou. It is heard that once all the troops arrive in Handan, they will go north along the Pinghan Line to participate in the front line. The telegram is recorded as follows: "The Japanese imperialist invasion of China has a long history, starting with Taiwan and Ryukyu, then Korea and Lushun. Recently, they have occupied the three northeastern provinces and seized Jinzhou. The bloodstains of Shanghai have not yet dried, and the beacon fire of Yuguan has risen repeatedly. Tianjin and Beijing are harassed, and Rehe is in emergency. They are nibbling away like silkworms and swallowing like whales, without adding to it. They have the heart of a demon and wage war without declaration. They abandon public treaties like waste paper and regard the League of Nations as child's play. They are barbaric and do whatever they want, regardless of everything. The enemy is deep in our territory, and national destruction is imminent. The way to save the country is to make up our minds, strengthen our will, each do our duty, each do our ability, pool our wisdom and efforts, and unanimously embrace the spirit of sacrifice and struggle. If we resist Japan in this way, Japan will inevitably be defeated. Moreover, the Japanese regime is manipulated by militarists, its foundation is fragile, and it will eventually collapse. To drive out the Japanese imperialist invasion is not only to restore our homeland, but also to relieve the suffering of the Japanese people. Japan is not without enlightened people. If they sincerely return, they will be welcomed. Good overseas Chinese will also be protected. Resisting the tyrannical Japan is precisely to seek world peace, promote the prestige of the League of Nations, extend the justice of the country, and fight for the survival of the nation. I hope that my compatriots will rise up quickly. Zhenwu has been a soldier for half his life, devoted to the revolution. He has long put life and death out of his mind, and what rights does he care about? Only thinking that the country is dying day by day, he cannot bear not to fulfill the duty of every citizen. Moreover, with the encouragement of comrades, the affection of subordinates, and the expectations of friends, he dares not be humble and gathers our army at Mianshan, swears an oath to support Rehe, and assumes the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. The day he receives the order is the time he pledges his life to the country, with the purpose of driving out the tyrannical Japan and the ambition of recovering the national territory. My dearest soldiers, we have shared weal and woe, and we will share joys and sorrows. Wherever the army goes, discipline will be strictly observed, and we must not disturb the people's grass or trees. We have pure thoughts and no slightest ambition. With a noble personality and great skills, we will fight to the death with the Japanese寇. Based on conscience and bloodiness, we will save the country from danger and relieve the people from misery. We will break our bones and crush our bodies, and we will not hesitate to move forward. Success or failure, gain or loss, we will not care about it. We hope that people across the country will give us assistance and guidance. Zhenwu is not talented, but he will accept it. I hope you will forgive my sincere feelings. Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, Fang Zhenwu, kowtows to the East."</p>

<h3>Blockade the Xu and He Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>Xu's Bandits Build Fortifications in Tongnan to Resist</p>
<p>He's Bandits Attempt to Flee to Sichuan to Liaise with Xu</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiangqian's remnants, after fleeing into northern Sichuan,</p>
<p>are planning to use this place as a new base, making every effort to manage it. In terms of expanding their strength, they have done everything they can to recruit bandits and coerce the people, both through intimidation and enticement. In just two months, their followers have reached more than 40,000 people, and the seriousness of the situation can be seen. Recently, Tian Songyao's troops recovered Bazhong and Changchi, and Liu Maoen's troops also occupied Zhuyuyuan and other places. The bandits' southern front was suddenly hit. They are building solid fortifications in Tongnan and Nanjiang, hoping to hold out for a long time. The Sichuan and Shaanxi armies have decided to take advantage of the victory and advance. Tian Songyao, Sun Zhen, Liu Maoen and others are all supervising the suppression at the front, with a deadline for capturing Tongnan. He Chengjun also telegraphed Liu Xiang for assistance. There will be fierce battles between Tongnan in the coming days. He Long's remnants</p>
<p>are still wandering in the border area between Hunan and Hubei, and are being attacked by the armies of Hunan and Hubei. On the 6th, according to He Jian's telegram, the bandits' morale is low, and they lack supplies. They intend to struggle to break through to the border area between Sichuan and Shaanxi to contact Xu's bandits. However, there are heavy troops stationed in western Hubei and eastern Sichuan. Although the bandits are ferocious, they will never be able to cross the Leichi River. Chiang Kai-shek and He Chengjun, in order to quickly eliminate the Xu and He bandits, in addition to ordering all armies to actively suppress them, also because the bandits' area lacks supplies, forming a situation of sitting and waiting for death, strictly ordered all armies to effectively blockade the bandits' area and cut off their supplies. The headquarters also formulated regulations for blockading the bandits' area, and issued a general order to comply with them. All food items such as grains, rice, wheat, salt, corn, beans, dried taro, livestock, military raw materials such as copper, iron, white lead, saltpeter, sulfur, coal, gasoline, cotton, electrical materials, and sanitary materials, Chinese and Western medicines are prohibited from being transported to the bandits' area. Special attention should be paid to food. In areas adjacent to the bandits' area, food management committees must be formed to handle investigation, storage, and distribution. Those who fail to make progress will be severely punished. (March 6)</p>
<h3>National Red Swastika Society Holds Meeting in Jinan</h3>
<p>Decides to Raise 600,000 to Handle Various Tasks</p>
<p>And to Relieve Frontline Soldiers and Northeastern Refugees</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Red Swastika Society of Beijing, previously because the war in Sichuan was incessant and the war in Rehe had broken out again, specially organized four rescue teams in Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Qinhuangdao, and Chongqing to go to various places to handle relief matters. In the past two months, it has spent more than 200,000 yuan in total, and it has not yet ended. In order to handle spring relief, relieve Northeastern refugees, and establish hospitals and orphanages, the association specially held the spring relief convention in Jinan. 214 representatives from Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoyang, Jilin, Chahar, Suiyuan, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Hankou, Wuchang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Guangdong, and Qingdao, Yantai, and Jinan in Shandong Province attended.

After each branch reported on the progress of the situation in recent days, they discussed relieving the frontline soldiers in Rehe, Northeastern refugees, establishing hospitals and orphanages, providing temporary relief, and providing relief for the aftermath of the Red areas in Anhui and Jiangxi. As for the plan to support the four rescue teams, it has already been decided, and it has also been decided to plan 600,000 yuan to handle various tasks. In the future, it is planned to divide the country into five regions: Tianjin, Jinan, Yantai, Qingdao and other places as the central region, Shaanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan and other places as the northwest region, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces as the southeast region, Henan and Hunan and other places as the southwest region, and Liaoning and Jilin and other places as the northeast region. Many members recognized the proposed donation of 600,000 yuan at that time, and they will also raise funds from other places, and the deadline is one month to raise all the funds and hand them over to the Beijing headquarters for distribution. As for the aftermath of the Red areas in Anhui and Jiangxi, an additional tens of thousands of yuan will be raised outside of the 600,000 yuan to provide relief.

<p>City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Dissatisfied with the Behavior of Rice Merchants</h3>
<p>Telegraphs the Provincial Government to Request Each County to</p>
<p>Protect Rice Boats Transporting Rice to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the dispute between rice merchants and the rice industry in this city over the issue of rice pecks has led to a strike, which has been delayed and unresolved, which is actually detrimental to the food supply of the city. Yesterday, it specially telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request each county to protect rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai. The original text reads: "To the Jiangsu Provincial Government: This is based on a letter from the Shanghai Rice Guild stating that the rice merchants transporting rice to this city have recently had a strike, claiming to change to using funnel pecks of rice, and the situation is fierce. People have been sent out to block rice boats from coming to Shanghai. Although the party and government agencies have convened various rice industry groups to mediate, it has not been resolved. It is found that the use of bamboo pecks of rice for rice and grain is a long-standing custom in the rice-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, with a long history. This time, the National Government clearly ordered the change to the new system of weights and measures, which has been considered and tested by government authorities many times. All recognized that the use of bamboo pecks of rice is qualified, so they formulated capacity, issued it to various provinces and cities, and transferred it to follow the system. The association also followed the issued regulations, changed the capacity of each device, and sent each device to the inspection office for inspection and implementation. However, the rice merchants transporting rice suddenly raised an objection, demanding the abolition of bamboo pecks and changing to the so-called funnel pecks. The inspection office of this city convened various rice industry groups for an on-site test, and also recognized that the use of bamboo pecks of rice is convenient and quick, while funnels are not applicable. However, the merchants have other intentions, and they do not hesitate to incite the wind, claiming a strike as a means of coercion. They disregard the announcements and bans issued by party and government agencies at all times, and they also include people outside the industry, and assign them to the four villages, such as the Nanhuanpu area belonging to the two counties of Shanghai and Songjiang, and the Huangdu and other places belonging to Jiading and Kunshan, to block rice boats from coming to Shanghai, in order to cause panic and achieve their unilateral demands. These actions not only violate laws and regulations, but also are detrimental to local security. The more than 1,000 rice shops of the association witnessed the actions of these merchants, and they were all resentful, fearing that the situation would become more serious, and they tried their best to persuade them with kind words and waited for a fair solution. I think that the merchants are the sellers, the rice shops are the buyers, and the rice shop peck masters stand in an intermediary position. If it is said that there are abuses in the peck, then we should trace the cause of the abuses and improve them. The rice-producing areas in the interior all use bamboo pecks of rice, and Shanghai is difficult to be unique. Moreover, the use of improper means to instigate people outside the industry to block rice boats midway, if this continues, will inevitably lead to unexpected panic. In this tense period of national crisis, if the local unrest is caused by a lack of food, can the merchants bear this heavy responsibility? In addition to advising colleagues to wait quietly and requesting the municipal government to quickly order the social and public security bureaus to find ways to stop the blockage of rice boats, we respectfully request that you order each county of Songjiang, Shanghai, Jiading, and Kunshan to send police to protect the rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai, to maintain the food supply and protect security.

<h3>Seven Provinces Build Highways</h3>
<p>Half the Cost of Materials, Transportation, and Installation</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of Bandits in the Three Provinces has suppressed the Communist bandits in Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, and recovered many lost territories. For every place recovered from the bandit areas, the headquarters immediately carries out rehabilitation work, and the most important thing is to build highways. The area where transportation is convenient is a place that the bandits cannot occupy. Therefore, the headquarters submitted this idea to the National Economic Commission for discussion and agreed to build highways in seven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, and Hunan, and actively carry them out. The routes have been demarcated, and special attention has been paid to the bandit areas. Because construction is about to begin, the materials needed for the seven provinces' highways have been ordered from Shanghai. Today, the headquarters transferred the order to the Ministry of Communications, instructing the Shanghai shipping companies to load the highway materials at half the price. The shipping companies have all complied.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Researches the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Personnel of the Soviet Russian Inspection Team Determined</p>
<p>After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, the signing of a commercial treaty between the two countries cannot be delayed. It must be determined whether the Soviet Union's foreign trade is operated by the state and whether China's trade with the Soviet Union should also be the same to establish the basis for negotiating the treaty. According to the International Trade Bureau this morning, the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry is currently studying this matter together with the Commercial Treaty Review Committee. The Ministry of Industry also recently consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and requested that a copy of the commercial treaties signed by the Soviet Union with Britain, Japan, Germany, and France be sent for reference. After the research has yielded substantial results, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance will be invited to discuss it further. In addition, the Soviet Russian Industrial Inspection Team to be formed by the Ministry of Industry is jointly formed by the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Ministry of Railways, and the industrial and banking sectors of this city. As for the selection of personnel for the inspection, it has now been decided that the Ministry of Industry will send three to five people, each ministry will send one person, and the industrial and banking sectors of this city will each send five people, totaling about 30 people, for a period of three months.</p>
<p>Philippine Merchants</p>
<h3>Strive to Develop the Market in China</h3>
<p>A Business Committee Group Will Come to China for Inspection</p>
<p>Group Leader Peng Gen Will Come to Shanghai in Mid-Month</p>
<p>Datong News Agency: Since the outbreak of the war, the movement to boycott Japanese goods in China has become more intense, and Japanese merchants' trade with China has come to an end. The Philippine merchant organizations stationed in Shanghai, in view of the Chinese people's resolute boycott of enemy goods, and in order to seize the position of Japanese merchants in China, telegraphed the Philippine government to request the rapid formation of a Far East business inspection team to come to China for activities. According to news from the Philippine merchants, the Philippine merchants have now organized a business committee, led by group leader Peng Gen, to come to China for inspection. The number of team members is about 20 to 30. Group leader Peng Gen also has an introduction letter from the Chinese Consul General stationed in Manila and will come to China first to contact our side on everything. It is expected that he will leave for Shanghai in mid-month. As for the departure date of all the team members, it will be decided after Peng Gen arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wu Jingxiong Resigns from the Municipal Councilor</h3>
<p>Wu Jingxiong, a member of the Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council, was recently promoted by the central government to the position of member of the Legislative Yuan. Due to busy official duties, he will inevitably be stationed in the capital for a long time. He cannot take care of the position of municipal councilor. He specially requested the Municipal Council to resign from the concurrent position of municipal councilor. The sixth meeting of the first standing committee of the council resolved to send a letter to the municipal government to submit it to the central government for approval. After receiving the letter, the municipal government immediately submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<h3>The Russian Ambassador Can Arrive in Shanghai Within the Next Month</h3>
<p>Will Temporarily Reside at the Old Site of the Russian Consulate</p>
<p>Regarding the news of Soviet Russian Ambassador Bogomolov's arrival in Shanghai, the Russian side previously telegraphed that he must wait for our Chinese Ambassador to Russia, Yan Huiliqing, to arrive in Russia and meet before departing. Now that Ambassador Yan has arrived in the Russian capital, the Russian Ambassador can depart for China. According to Lai Wen, the Soviet Russian Commercial Representative stationed in Shanghai, he has not yet received the exact date of Ambassador Bao's arrival in China, but he expects to arrive in Shanghai within the next month. The Soviet Russian Consulate next to the Waibaidu Bridge in this city has hired workers to repair it, and it will be completed this month. It will be temporarily used as Ambassador Bao's residence.</p>

<p>Japanese Embassy</p>
<h3>Denies That the Japanese Government Has Summoned Arichi Back Home</h3>
<p>But Says That Arichi Will Request Leave to Return Home for Personal Matters</p>
<p>Central News Agency: This morning's newspaper reported that the Japanese Minister to China, Arichi Akira, was summoned back to his country. This morning, the reporter specially visited Minister Arichi at the Japanese Consulate General. Minister Arichi was in a meeting with a diplomatic representative of a certain country, so he sent his secretary, Asaga, to meet in his place. According to what he told the reporter, the news that Minister Arichi was summoned back to his country is not accurate. The embassy has not received an order from the government to recall him. However, it is known that Minister Arichi previously stated that he would request leave to return home for personal matters at the end of March. This is a personal action and has absolutely no diplomatic or political meaning. Moreover, whether or not it will happen at that time will depend on the situation between China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Savings in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Will Be Returned in Full</h3>
<p>The Postal Savings Bureau is Drafting Measures That Can Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>Regarding the postal savings in the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, after being seized by the pseudo-organization instigated by Japan, almost a year has passed. The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in view of the Northeastern people's repeated experiences of war, displacement, poverty, and lack of support, needs to return the money as soon as possible to alleviate the people's difficulties. The bureau previously requested the Ministry of Communications to return the money in full. This morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited the bureau and, according to the person in charge, the postal savings in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang total more than 230,000 yuan. The Executive Yuan's meeting has already approved the return, so the bureau is currently drafting detailed measures that can be announced and implemented soon. As for the postal savings in Rehe, the amount of savings in Beipiao, Chaoyang, and Chengde is very small. Rehe belongs to the Hebei postal district. The postmaster of the district, Koton, has not yet reported on the postal savings in Rehe to the bureau, so the current situation is not yet known.</p>
<p>Shanghai</p>
<h3>Resumption of Parcel Service to Northern Gansu Post Office</h3>
<p>No Need for Detours for Packages to Ningxia</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice to all subordinate offices: Parcel service to northern Gansu is now resumed as usual, effective immediately. Parcels will be routed through Suide for transportation, and the previously added surcharge to compensate for detours will be cancelled.</p>
<p>The notice stated:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of notification: It has been found that parcel deliveries to various locations in northern Gansu previously required routing through Chang'an and Pingliang due to bandit activity west of Suide, resulting in high transportation costs. Therefore, a surcharge was levied on recipients, as informed by Gansu Administration letter number 352. This was communicated by bureau number 1402 as documented.</p>
<p>Now, in response to circular number 384, which briefly opens by approving Shaanxi Administration circular number 115, the situation in areas west of Suide has improved. All parcels and heavy items destined for these areas will resume normal acceptance and forwarding. Therefore, parcels from the southeastern provinces to Ningxia, Pingluo, Shizuishan, Dabaikou, Yandi, Wuzhongbao, Ningxiabao, Zhongjie, all bureaus, subordinate agencies, and village postal boxes should be routed through Yangqu and Suide for swift delivery. The surcharge previously imposed on recipients due to detours via Chang'an and Pingliang should be immediately cancelled.</p>
<p>As such, this notice is issued to ensure compliance. Postal Director Zha Peilin.</p>

The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway was indebted for 54,553,176 yuan, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was indebted for 10,306,777 yuan. The combined debt of the two railways amounted to 64,853,873 yuan. Therefore, Railway Minister Huang Boqiao has been specially ordered to swiftly establish a debt restructuring committee to manage the debts and maintain credit.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Beijing Line</p>
<h3>Northbound Flight Cancelled This Morning</h3>
<p>New Aircraft to Arrive in Shanghai in Two Weeks</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation, to facilitate transportation, has restored the Shanghai-Beijing air route to three flights per week. Today, Thursday, was scheduled for a northbound flight, but it was cancelled due to unfavorable weather conditions this morning. However, the westbound flight on the Shanghai-Hankou line departed at 9:10 AM because the weather along the Yangtze River, though cloudy and rainy, did not hinder flying. In addition, the company's purchased Lorraine-type seaplane from the United States is being shipped to Shanghai by the Dale Company and is expected to arrive in two weeks.</p>
<h3>German World Cruise Ship Delayed to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to Loss of One Propeller</p>
<p>The German HAPAG world cruise ship "Lissoula," which annually carries over two hundred tourists on a round-the-world voyage, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this week after departing from New York and crossing the Atlantic and Europe. However, near India, one of the ship's propellers suddenly fell off for unknown reasons. The captain had to reduce speed to two nautical miles per hour. Upon arrival in Mumbai, the ship entered dry dock for ten days of repairs, delaying its arrival in Shanghai by two weeks.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrivals of Large Quantities of Italian Rayon</h3>
<p>Italian rayon, which is selling well in China, is being imported in large quantities. A large shipment of over 1,700 cases arrived last month by Italian ships, as reported in this newspaper. Due to increasing demand for rayon from Chinese silk weaving factories, import companies ordered a second large shipment this year. This shipment, totaling 1,340 cases worth 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, arrived on the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde." The import tariff on each case of rayon is over 200 yuan, more than double the cost. Starting today, the handling companies have begun to collect the goods. Those not yet sold are temporarily stored in customs warehouses.</p>
<p>Kidnapping and Robbery by Notorious Bandit</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of Qian Qidong</h3>
<p>Police Request Priority Hearing for Two Kidnapping Cases</p>
<p>Qian Qidong of Qingpu, also known as "Big Brother," habitually kidnapped people for ransom and organized robberies as his livelihood, committing countless crimes. The First District Local Court issued multiple warrants for his arrest, and the Public Concession Police also offered a 500-yuan reward for his capture. However, Qian had many henchmen, was well-informed, and evaded capture until recently, when he was apprehended by the police in connection with a kidnapping case. The facts are recorded below.</p>
<p>On the 15th of last month, at 10 AM, Chinese Detective Yuan Xizhong of the General Police Station and Chinese Constable Number 221 were patrolling near Szechuan Road on Avenue Edward VII when they noticed a man loitering suspiciously near the Merchandise Exchange. Upon searching him, they found a loaded pistol on his person. He was identified as Shen Baorong from Tongzhou, who was preparing to kidnap Shao Jingyun, the president of the East Asia Bank, at the exchange. Upon successful execution, he intended to hide Shao at house number 22, lane 429, Chongqing Road. Chinese Detective Chief Xie Shuiquan, Huang Yongji, and others rushed to the location and arrested accomplices. Unexpectedly, Qian arrived at that moment to inspect the bandit hideout and was apprehended by the detectives. Qian confessed to the Shao kidnapping, stating that he had advanced all the funds used by the bandits. He also implicated Zhang Jifa, who was apprehended by detectives at house number 171-176, Longhua Road, in the Chinese district and handed over to the First Special District Court for detention.</p>
<p>Detective Chief Xie and others discovered that Qian was involved in numerous other cases, with strong evidence in three: (1) The kidnapping of Zhang Qingsheng, owner of the Hengfu Silver Shop on Nanjing Road, on September 10, 1929, who was later ransomed by Zhang with a large sum. (2) The kidnapping of Wang Zhensheng, young owner of the Wang Yuqin Tea Shop at house number 2, lane 411, Jing'an Temple Road, on March 21, 1931, for a large ransom. (3) The robbery of 46,000 yuan from the Four Banks Joint Savings Society on Fuzhou Road and Guangdong Road at 2:15 PM on March 13, 1930.</p>
<p>This morning, Qian was escorted to the First Special District Court Criminal Court, where Criminal Court Judge Qian Hongye conducted the interrogation. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi presented the case, stating that of the three cases against Qian, two were kidnapping and one was robbery. He requested that the trial for the robbery of 46,000 yuan from the Four Banks Joint Savings Society be suspended, and that only the two kidnapping cases be pursued. He then submitted the court's arrest warrant and the police's reward poster for Qian Qidong for review. Judge Qian reviewed the report, questioned the defendants, and ordered them to be remanded to custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<p>[Page 21] Lavish Night in a Brothel</p>
<p>Ultimately Due to a Bad Check</p>
<p>Involving Many People</p>
<p>Yan Shurong, a native of this county residing at house number 32, Dafu Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, used to work in a foreign firm but is now unemployed. However, Yan has a penchant for pleasure and continues to visit prostitutes despite his unemployment. One of the prostitutes at the Leyu Lane brothel on Guangxi Road, Ling Caijuan, is his favorite. On the evening of the 26th of last month, at Ling's invitation, Yan hosted a banquet in her room, incurring expenses of approximately 86 yuan. However, Yan was penniless and unable to pay. He borrowed a 60-yuan check from the Continental Bank payable in ten days from his friend Zhang Jiaqi, and added 26 yuan in cash, paying Ling, who then passed it on to the madam, Xu Tangshi, to resolve the situation. However, Xu Tangshi urgently needed the money and exchanged the check for cash with a patron, Sun Jiren, who agreed. Sun presented the check at the Continental Bank the other day, where the bank discovered that the check had been cancelled and that there was no account under the name of Zhang Jiaqi. The check was evidently forged, and Sun was detained and handed over to the General Police Station. Detective Cheng Renkun investigated and discovered that Yan had given the check. Yan was arrested and temporarily detained. This morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court Criminal Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi presented the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation, stating that Yan claimed Zhang Jiaqi had given him the check, which may be true as the police confirmed his existence and found his business card, but were unable to arrest Zhang.</p>
<p>When questioned, Yan Shurong stated that he had borrowed the check from Zhang to tide him over and had given Zhang 60 yuan three days later, asking him to deposit it in the bank to cover the check when it was due. However, Zhang did not deposit the money, leading to the incident. Yesterday, he led the detective to Sien Lane, Datong Road, to find Zhang, but Zhang had disappeared. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confession and ordered Yan to post a 1,000-yuan bail and await further summons.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Criminal Hot Soup</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Able to control lost territory externally and shield North China internally, possessing a special significance on the international stage, was this not the Rehe that Zhang and Tang of the North jointly declared a week ago they were determined to resist and defend with their lives? Yet, how long has it been? This mere empty declaration, barely reaching the mainland, was struck by a sudden bolt from the blue. Rehe, once a bastion of defense and offense, has day by day changed its colors. The ghastly, dreadful Rising Sun flag is now aslant upon the city of Chengde, carried on the howling north winds, bringing with it the cold, mocking laughter of the "Demon King of East Asia"! We, without weapons and with lives as cheap as grass, are simply "damned" commoners. What can we do?</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Peiping, when the national traitor, Rehe's Tang, abandoned the city and fled, the invading enemy forces numbered only a few hundred. The national traitor, rather than resisting, only cared about transporting his two hundred-plus carloads of valuables and opium. His dog, Fu Ren, also hid twenty boxes of Central Bank notes in the Eastern Legation Quarter in Peiping. Furthermore, two-thirds of his property was seized in Shenyang. These countless fortunes, every single drop, were scraped from the blood and sweat of us commoners. Now, they dare to use the pretext of resistance to swindle another massive sum of nearly a million yuan, tuck it tightly around their waists, and then serenely "flee to Peach Blossom Land." Devouring the marrow of the people in times of peace and ruining the great affairs of the nation in times of crisis, these foolish, indolent, and "precious treasures," descendants of their ancestors, shouldn't the government and the people quickly unite to apprehend them and administer exemplary punishment? Or are we to continue preserving them to offer as tribute to some emperor?</p>
<p>Although the Control Yuan has filed an impeachment, whether it will succeed remains to be seen, like an empty cannon. Now that this stupid pig—Rehe's Tang—has been exposed as a bane to the nation and the people, if, amidst the public rage, we still cannot slay him, how will the government explain itself to the world?</p>
<p>Misfortunes never come singly, especially in these times of rampant wickedness. Even if we severely punish the first Rehe's Tang, it is hard to guarantee that there won't be other Rehe's Tangs attempting to profit from the chaos, preparing to enjoy the "blessings of a minister of a fallen state." But unfortunately, if the nation truly falls, won't the twenty boxes of banknotes that Rehe's Tang hoarded in the Eastern Legation Quarter turn into worthless paper? And even if the nation falls, not all of the four hundred million commoners will necessarily perish. There will naturally be opportunities for retribution and settling accounts with these "ministers of a fallen state" one day!</p>

<h3>Neon Light Ballast</h3>
<p>— Han Kejun</p>
<p>Having read Ah Tang's article on neon lights, I'll discuss neon light ballasts.</p>
<p>Installing a neon light entails installing a ballast, making them inseparable. I will describe its structure and principle below.</p>
<p>Thick and thin copper wires are wound into two types of coils: a thin wire coil called a high-tension coil, and a thick copper wire coil called a low-tension coil. The high and low tension coils are arranged separately, front and back, with small magnetic iron plates (By Pass Lamination) between them. The surrounding center is built with horizontally arranged E-shaped thin magnetic iron plates (Main Lamination). The large magnetic iron plates are arranged alternately, one upright and one inverted, about eighty to ninety sheets in total. This ensures durability and uniform magnetic force.</p>
<p>The coils and magnetic iron are insulated with layers of paper, cardboard, and other insulating materials. Furthermore, each layer of each coil is coated with insulating paint and separated by specially made insulating paper. Once all components are perfect, they are tested with a high-voltage current exceeding the rated voltage to ensure insulation integrity. If the insulation remains intact, the ballast is then placed in an iron box, and the empty spaces are filled with insulating compound (Trope), which provides both electrical and air insulation, before being sold to shops that install neon lights.</p>
<p>The reason for insulating every part of the neon light ballast is that neon lights require extremely high voltage. Therefore, high and low voltages must be absolutely insulated, and the magnet should also be insulated. Any slight weakness in insulation can allow the high-voltage coil to flow through, posing a life-threatening danger if someone touches it. Therefore, manufacturers of neon light ballasts must meticulously ensure insulation.</p>
<p>When current flows through the coils, the magnet generates magnetic flux. As the magnetic flux enters the coils, the electromagnetic induction due to the changing quantity causes the high-voltage coil to become an extremely high current. This is the principle of the neon light ballast.</p>
<p>In the past, neon light ballasts were all imported. In recent years, some are manufactured domestically, but only by Yaguang Manufacturing Company in this city and two or three others.</p>

<h3>Lament for the Mass Burial of Starving Corpses</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from a friend in Gansu, enclosing a Five-Character Ancient Poem by Deng Deyi, inscribed on a photograph of the mass burial of starving corpses in Linxia, which was published in this journal on November 17th of last year. Having now received Deng's original, each word is a tear, unbearable to finish reading. I supplement it below, to express grief and sorrow:</p>
<p>Yan Yi is repeatedly devastated by war, people scatter like birds and beasts, venturing out at night, daring to report their hardships, lives spared by sheer luck, exhausted and hiding in caves, gasping for breath, afraid to pant, bare-chested, no shame, women also barefoot, when the chaos subsides, no home to return to, how to identify the former location, having fields but lacking the strength to till, especially since drought has struck, the government distributes relief, receiving such grace is not insignificant, but alas, there are too many people, the well is deep, the rope is still short, begging throughout the city and countryside, difficult to obtain even one bowl all day long, alas, those caught in the disaster, ultimately turning into corpses in ditches, some with limbs already mangled, some with heads already severed, some with blood still flowing, some with hair still braided, some with mouths twisting and turning, festering and unable to be washed, some with thighs bent and twisted, unable to be massaged, wishing to move them, the flesh falling off, unable to grasp, truly, people in chaotic times, not as good as dogs in peaceful times, gathered together as one mound, barely sealing a three-foot grave, who pours the wheat gruel, heartbroken tears flowing silently.</p>
<h3>A Play</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>It's already the time when peach blossoms are in full bloom, yet the weather remains cold. No one is eager to initiate anything new. Under the lamplight, everyone buries their head in their work, hoping to finish early, put on their coats, and go home to sleep peacefully. Today, the weather is still just as cold, but because four or five colleagues have returned from enjoying wine and women at the Ma Shang Hou establishment, the air is somewhat filled with the feeling of spring. I am the youngest among my colleagues, and besides saying a few witty remarks occasionally, I can't invent any other "plays," nor do I try to. Today, seeing that they are slightly weary of their work, I inadvertently said to Chen at my table, "Want to go to the teahouse?" Although it was said lightly, it seemed to startle the souls of everyone in the room like a bomb.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>"Spring's colors cannot be confined to the garden," Old He, the pretty boy, slightly nodded and hummed a line of poetry that was never in tune. Naturally, he meant to be sarcastic, but my colleagues who knew his usual behavior understood that he was willing to sing out of tune to support the suggestion of "going to the teahouse."</p>
<p>"Little Zhang, are there any unexpected miracles?" Chen seemed to have forgotten that I often opposed their actions, calling me a clueless little brother.</p>
<p>"Little brother, it has been three days, you should look at me with new eyes!" Old He liked to quote popular phrases, but he always said them out of tune.</p>
<p>After a few jokes, as if they had received some signal, everyone buried their heads back into their work. I thought the amusing scene had already ended. After finishing my work, I put on my coat, preparing to go home, but Chen grabbed my arm and said, "Slipping away alone?"</p>
<p>The casual "Want to go to the teahouse?" had already been taken as fact by them.</p>
<p>Old He also jumped up and said, "Don't underestimate him because he's a little brother. He's very cunning!"</p>
<p>At this point, I regretted having initiated this "play" in the first place. Now, arguing was useless. The "little brother's" crime had already been groundlessly judged. The three of us left the newspaper office, walking westward into the cold wind as if being escorted.</p>
<p>"Little Zhang, where to?" Chen couldn't help but ask, because I hadn't spoken and kept walking forward.</p>
<p>"I don't know where to go either?"</p>
<p>"To the teahouse!" Old He shouted loudly, forgetting that this was the bustling city center.</p>
<p>A few laughs came from the roadside. Old He embarrassedly nudged me with his hand.</p>
<p>"Old He, there really isn't anywhere to go, but if you two propose somewhere, this little brother will accompany you!" Seeing that the situation had become a stalemate, I offered this compromise.</p>
<p>"Little rascal!" Old He said, then continued to walk silently.</p>
<p>"Let's go to XX!" Chen suggested.</p>
<p>The excitement from when we left was gone. XX used to be a name that could be heard every day in the office, with daily news connecting to the two words "XX."</p>
<p>Not expressing an opinion, Old He and I followed Chen around the corner. At this time, the chartered cars with electric lights crisscrossed. The six eyes of the three pedestrians greedily scrutinized every chartered car, hoping to find the answer to the night in them.</p>
<p>"Little Chen!" A woman on an oncoming chartered car greeted Chen.</p>
<p>"Busy as always! Going out for a performance?"</p>
<p>The chartered car had already passed by, and I asked Old He, "Who was that?"</p>
<p>"That's XX," Old He replied angrily.</p>
<p>Having lost all hope, I felt the cold wind cuttingly. Finally, Old He dejectedly said, "Let's go home!"</p>
<p>Nodding in agreement, each of us jumped into cars by the roadside.</p>
<p>The call of a newspaper vendor selling the evening edition came from behind: "Rehe fallen! Tang Yulin to be shot!"</p>
<h3>New Spring</h3>
<p>— Sheng Ai Nai</p>
<p>A warm spring breeze gently caresses me, fluttering my sleeves, causing me to feel slightly intoxicated.</p>
<p>The water in the small river is calm and clear like a mirror. Suddenly, a gust of spring wind ripples the calm water, creating countless wrinkles.</p>
<p>In the azure sky, besides a few fluffy clouds like sheep and soaring birds, there is nothing else.</p>
<p>These clouds and birds are detached from this earthly world, carefree and at ease in this pure expanse.</p>
<p>A group of children, like little angels, dressed in light clothing, each face radiating a happy smile, some reading books, some kicking shuttlecocks, some building houses, all using their chubby hands and feet, lively and energetic, under the arrival of the god of spring, enveloped by the vastness of nature.</p>
<p>Three or five snow-white sheep graze with lowered heads, emitting soft chewing sounds, appearing from afar like a large pile of cotton.</p>
<p>In the deep valley, orchids emit a quiet, elegant fragrance, appreciating their own beauty.</p>
<p>A group of brown cattle and horses graze on a large grassy field in front of a thatched cottage, some lowering their heads to eat grass, some lying under the gentle sunlight, all free, carefree, immersed in the bright and beautiful spring day.</p>
<p>Ah! Beautiful spring scenery! I am enchanted.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My father lost his job three years ago. Although he had never been unemployed before and his income was not bad, he somehow accumulated debts of over three thousand yuan. Now, he has fortunately found a position with a monthly salary of only a dozen yuan. He has another woman in Shanghai. Although this woman is often ill, strangely enough, she is raising three young children. In this expensive city, my father's meager salary isn't even enough to support their livelihood, let alone pay off debts. Most of my father's debts were handled by my maternal uncle. Initially, he paid a lot of interest out of his own pocket, fearing that the creditors would come after us, but now he has also lost his job and can no longer afford to cover the payments. As a result, the creditors are becoming increasingly insistent, driving my maternal uncle, who is in his fifties, to the brink of despair, unable to eat or sleep. He constantly complains to me, but I only earn seven yuan a month, and I truly "lack the strength" to help.</p>
<p>I also have a mother, two younger sisters, and a younger brother in my hometown, who depend on cultivating a few rented fields and the two or three yuan I send back each month to survive. My mother, poisoned by the saying "when a son grows up, he should marry," arranged a marriage for me last year, stating that I would be marrying into the family. The other side wants me to move there this year. When I think about it, won't this only increase their burden? The seven yuan I earn each month may be a small amount, but the two or three yuan I send home each month is still a valuable supplement to the household income. If I get married, not only will I be unable to support my family, but I'm afraid I won't even have enough for myself! Therefore, I want to resolutely oppose it.</p>
<p>I am now thinking of gathering a few friends, asking them to contribute money, and using my own strength to work my way up, starting small and growing big, hoping to find a bright path forward. Editor, my worries are truly layered upon layered, difficult to express in words. Furthermore, I dropped out of school at the age of twelve, so my writing is disorganized. Please forgive me, have pity on me, and give me some guidance. (Remainder omitted)</p>

<p>Editor's Note: "Strictly adhering to guarantee responsibilities" and "sons repaying fathers' debts" are both "natural and righteous" principles prescribed by old morality, and even stipulated by law. However, you should know that these "old moralities" and "laws" are merely tools used by capitalists to shackle the weak. For Xu's maternal uncle to be forced to pay on behalf of others when he is unemployed is practically killing him! Under these circumstances, asking Xu to take on his father's debt of over three thousand yuan is simply preventing him from ever having a chance to rise up! Xu! Xu's maternal uncle! Do you willingly accept being shackled, with no path to survival? Money is cold and cannot clothe you, and hunger cannot be satisfied with it. Those who have money to lend are not harmed even if you don't repay them. After all, they certainly won't be waiting for this money to survive! Even if you cannot defeat the evil capitalists, then let "wrongs have their origins" and "debts have their debtor." Your father should be the one responsible.</p>
<p>As for Xu's marriage problem, it was originally stated that he would be marrying into the family. According to our understanding, the woman's family must have considerable wealth. At the very least, after moving in, you won't necessarily have to bear a large responsibility, so we believe that Xu might as well give it a try. Furthermore, if this can reduce your responsibility for your father's debts, it would be killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Speaking of your path forward, you want to gather a few friends, ask them to contribute money, and use your own strength to work. This is certainly an excellent ideal. I wonder if you have already started contacting them? What are their attitudes? As we see it, it might ultimately be difficult to find a good friend in this world who is willing to contribute money for you to work. Good friends mostly don't have money. This reminds us again, what is the situation of your prospective in-laws? If they have the means, discussing it with them might lead to success!</p>

<h3>Coal Mountain (Continued)</h3>
<p>— By Ed Falkowiki, Translated and Condensed by Zhixiang</p>
<p>Midway through the discussion, the back door suddenly opened, and Strobel entered. He was an executive committee member of the union: a tall Hungarian with a sparse mustache; his slicked-back hair and overall demeanor exuded arrogance and ferocity. Dressed in a well-tailored suit, a light blue tie adorned with a not-so-expensive jewel, he unmistakably projected an aura of authority. This type of activity in his youth had secured him this superior position, and his political maneuvering had enabled him to maintain this position for two decades. He particularly enjoyed engaging in disputes with groups of young, radical elements. He was most proud of his ability to resolve conflicts involving mine workers with drastic measures. His daily life had reached the standards of the American upper class. He lived on Gading Street, where mostly wealthy people, such as doctors or lawyers, resided. His wife often frequented famous gambling dens, and his son was studying at a Catholic university.</p>
<p>Because of his family's lavish lifestyle, his responsibilities grew heavier day by day; therefore, he felt that his position as an executive committee member of the union was very important.</p>
<p>Strobel quickly ascended the stage, leaned against the back of the chair, busily packed tobacco into his pipe, lit it, and took a vigorous puff. He then put down his pipe and leaned his upper body forward, nodding slightly to those he knew, cocking his ear to listen to the person who was speaking—a tall young man with fiery eyes.</p>
<p>"If the current situation continues like this," he said, "our work is not worth a pinch of snuff. The foreman issues orders every day to oppress us, and these orders only incite our resistance. We cannot accept these unreasonable orders."</p>
<p>One after another, they continued to rush onto the stage. Their faces were flushed, and their hands, stained with coal dust, appeared particularly thick and yellow, as if wearing natural gloves. "Tunnels," "mules," "machines," "iron sheets," "tons"—various terms were spewed out amid the noisy chatter. Resolute and sorrowful words shot like bullets into the smoke-filled air. "Chairman, brothers," another voice emerged from the smoke.</p>
<p>"This is Tan En," the chairman introduced the speaker to the audience.</p>
<p>"Now is the time for us to decide on several proposals," the speaker said. He was a courageous man, and his face, filled with fervor, indicated that he was thoughtful. "Whether we are human beings or not, whether we can tolerate the foremen trampling on us, we must make some kind of statement. This contract is a contract that approves of our oppression, and our union leaders have already signed it. They can rest easy and receive a thousand yuan in remuneration each month. How comfortable their lives are! But we are suffering so much—we must find a way to deal with it bravely. This is a time for resistance, comrades—I say, we should strike—until our suffering is reduced."</p>
<p>"Strike!" A wave of enthusiastic shouts followed.</p>
<p>The chairman stood up and tapped the table with a small mallet. "Order, Strobel has something to say," he shouted. The union executive committee member placed his pipe on the table, his monkey-like eyes glancing at the crowd, waiting for the commotion below the stage to cease.</p>
<p>"Brothers," he shouted loudly, "you want to strike, but that is the method of the Communist Party. We are not all communists, and Russia is the stronghold of communism. Your actions make things very difficult for us executive committee members. It is easy for you to strike, but in the end, you want us to mediate."</p>
