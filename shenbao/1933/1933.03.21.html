<p>美蘇復交與日蘇關係晦</p>
<p>（一）美蘇兩國間之畸形關聨</p>
<p>美國取認蘇聨與蘇聨恢復尋常外交最近又成爲世界注目間題之一在美國國内多數人民固多傾向國内問題於其所謂市面繁榮尤爲注意對世界一般問題殊不甚關心復有門羅主義爲其傳統的對外政策歐洲大陸各國與北美合衆國具百億以上之戰債係美國對之亦缺乏充分之理解與體騐遑論蘇聨本爲今世獨特之新國家其不易爲人所明悉乃屬常事不過美蘇兩國間之不協調美國今未承認蘇聨彼此無國交關係而有個人往來者除情感上衝之外巴庫油區股票問題實爲其重心</p>
<p>然而事實需要且爲大勢所迫個人或少數人欲勉强加以阻止究爲不可能之事是故美國與蘇聨之間縱無外交關係足資保障而蘇聨又明明由信奉共產主義者當政則美國對蘇聨貿易在表面上確具最大之危險性資本安全殆將無從保障但自蘇聨國基鞏固五年計劃實施以來其對美貿易日見良好去年美貨輸蘇之所以低落至二千四百萬盧布者殆以英德之市塲競爭經濟恐慌亦爲貿易衰落基因之一然美國之欲開拓市場借以减低其經濟恐慌之風潮恢復已往之繁榮求得資本主義之新平衡固一刻未忘也且美國產業界主要事業多爲鋼鐵機械等重工業而蘇聨所急需者亦爲機機鋼鐵與夫資本主義先進各國之技術此正爲美國所多而急於输出者也惟歐洲大陸之情勢最堪注目者第一爲希特勒當政任情奔放對凡爾賽和約極力詆毁於軍備問題亦要求平等於國際間則以聨合意大利爲主勢將演成法西斯的國際組織然暗中仍與金融資本家携手形成最高段的金融資本獨裁形勢而於國内建設尙不免步巴本經濟政策之後塵威瑪爾憲法（民主政治）勢將退休對社會民主黨及共產黨皆施以嚴酷無情之打擊與壓迫其主要目的固在乎穩定希特勒政權也對蘇聨雖不如對凡爾賽和約壓惡之深而蘇德關係亦將不似已往之圓滿進行其事實甚顯著今後蘇德經濟關係恐將受政治外交上不安之影響而陷於滯遲美國際此到</p>
<p>處碰壁戰債難期收回對外投資凍結金融恐慌未已之際能不嚴重考慮美蘇國交之回復耶其間尙有較之西歐關係尤爲嚴重者即遠東問題是也蓋日蘇已有國交在前我中國之被侵略間接亦予美國以開拓在華市塲莫大之打擊故美國更當嚴密考慮其出路</p>

<p>日美關係漸趨惡化爲世界所共知勿須君述而獨占兼併與利益均霑之不能並存尤爲顯明今後若干年中現制度如果存在此種衝突必無調解之可能同時日本帝國主義者此種獨霸的軍事行動我中國設不能以鐵拳加以制止則英美法各國惟有暫時袖手旁觀美國縱極憤怒縱極厭惡亦止於憤怒厭惡而已此外更不能作任何進一步之有效表示蓋恐因此而惹起重大結果招來意外禍患也於是日本乃得暢其所欲擴大九一八事變至於北滿大有攫取中東鐵路爲已有之勢過去一年之間蘇聨雖屢屢提示訂立日蘇互不侵犯條約而日本則殊堅持非有交換條件不可中東鐵路之讓渡蓋即其重要條項之一也蘇聨對此豈能取認然日本之所以持此者亦有故一則彼之侵略東北也即號於世界資本主義各國日我爲預防赤化南侵爲保持東洋和平再則曰抑制中國赤化防護遠東市塲之安全確立日本之所謂生命綫同時松岡洋右經蘇境時滯留赤都莫斯科者一星期與蘇聨要人交換意見藉圖日蘇間之諒解松方幸次郎且大購赤油更自事實上增進日蘇交誼由此可知日本正欲利用對蘇聨不即不離之關係以從横於列國之間從中取巧以攫奪我國北部領土然蘇聨迄今未有確切之表示據往事以推將來彼將仍持審愼度决不肯輕舉妄動其靜觀主義之依然繼續尤爲顯然</p>
<p>美國之對蘇復交洵有若干政治意味對日關係固甚重大而實際關聨恐經濟的成分多而政治的（外交）運用較少也緣此時美國在急求經上平衡過剩之重工業商品如能在蘇聨脫售亦爲恢復繁榮之一道蘇聨五年計劃雖云成功然僅初步建設此後仍將潛心於國内之造就必無疑義是故美蘇即令復交日蘇間縱使裂痕加深於日本侵略不無影響但仍不能制止日軍之横行减少其軍事的冒險之突進恐更將變本加厲肆其暴力耳</p>

<p>在中央黨部紀念週報告</p>
<p>唯一的出路就是抵抗更須注意抵抗的能力</p>
<p>中央舉行重要會議</p>
<p>南京　汪院長宋副院長偕褚民誼·會仲鳴·陳公博·唐有壬·甘乃光·石青陽·白雲梯·朱家驊·陳壁君·梁寒操等二十日晨七時三刻抵京、宋在和平門下車、汪等在下關下車、林主席派文官長魏懷代表、赴站歡迎、此外尙有唐生智·葉楚傖·陳紹寛·張繼·賀耀祖·谷正倫·陳焯·王陸一·陳樹人·克興額·谷正綱及各機關代表數百人、在站歡迎、汪下車後、即乘車赴中央黨部、出席紀念週報告、（二十日中央社電）</p>
<p>南京　汪院長出席紀念週後、即返鐵道部官舍休息、十時至中央舉行重要會議林主席·于右任·居正·戴傳賢·葉楚傖·張繼·朱家驊·陳紹寛·羅文幹等均出席、正午散會、褚民誼談、汪糖尿症較過新加坡時略重、復任行政院長否、視體力而定、但不論復職與否、必在中央負責、汪赴保晤蔣、抑蔣返京、現尙未定、（二十日中央社電）</p>
<p>南京　二十晨十時、中央黨部有重要會議汪精衛·宋子文·及在京中央各要人均出席、聞對國防外交等問題、均有　密請論、（二十日專電）</p>
<p>南京　中央黨部廿日晨九時舉行總理紀念週、林主席于右任居正等均參加由汪院長報告、原文謂主席各位同志、兄弟今朝綫下火車、來參加紀念週、原欲聽聽主席及各位同志的言論、但主席要兄弟說幾句話、兄弟雖没有預備、但主席的意思、大約因爲兄弟出去了幾個月、現在回來、給些機會、俾兄弟得與各位同志見面、所以兄弟也祇得說幾句話、回想幾個月以前、中央體念兄弟病狀嚴重、予以數月假期、俾得赴歐療治、中央的厚意、兄弟誠然感激但當這國家危急存亡的時候、各位同、志正在緊張工作努力奮鬥、而兄弟獨優遊病榻、實在問心難安、及至山海關噩耗傳來、祇得不待病體痊愈、倉皇回國、路上得了熱河失陷的噩耗、倍加憂僨、隨又得着消息、蔣介石同志北上督師、各路將士同心協力、支持戰綫、兄弟由憂憤之中、得着些少安慰、及念到前敵抗日將士的勞苦犠牲、與中央各同志的艱難共濟、又由安慰之中、抱着無限悚惶、兄弟今謹對於前敵將士及中央各位同志、致最深的敬禮、兄弟有什麽話想說呢、時至今日除了抵抗兩字更無話說、固然抵抗與交涉並行、但應付時局之根本原則、須先有抵抗、然後有交涉、最近國際聨盟的議决、表明日本是侵略者、中國是被侵略者、世界的公道尙未全没、這是交涉的成績、亦即是抵抗的結果、今日以後抵抗愈得力、交涉愈有希望、否則無交涉可言、所以今日我們唯一的出路、就是抵抗、說到抵抗裏頭、似乎含着多少意義、我們第一固然要有抵抗的决心、第二要有抵抗的能力、中國今日應該没有一個人没有抵抗的决心的、這無待言、今所</p>

<p>要說的、只是抵抗的能力、什麽呌抵抗能力呢、最顯明的、固然是武力、但武力從何發生呢、先從物質上說、我們的武器是很缺乏的、這是人所共知、槍砲彈藥、以及一切軍事用具、都比不上敵人、我們前敵將士、幾乎是血肉之軀、與敵人科學的武器槍肉摶、要講充實抵抗的能力、第一要充實武器、這是無可疑的、但武器從何充實呢、是否抵抗的能力在物質上限於武器呢、中國號稱以農立國、但就去年海關數目字來講、糧食入口總價額至三萬萬兩壩我們以農立國的中國、每年要拿三萬萬兩去買外國的糧食、没有這些糧食入口、中國人民就要餓死、如果餓死、縱有武器、也無從拿來打仗、可見抵抗的能力在物質上不只限於武器了、困窮的中國人、要拿出三萬萬兩來買糧食、纔能免於餓死那麽那有餘錢來制造武器以至買人武器呢、可見得抵抗的能力、在物質上也要各方面都顧到了、近代的國家、大約平時注重於生、產發展人民的生產能力、及至戰時、則將人民的生產能力、儘量敵用於抵抗的武力、所以人民的生產能力愈大、則抵抗的武力亦愈大、以歐戰時的俄國而論、他平時不注重於國民的生產能力而只注意於武力的充實、所以與德國交戰、一敗塗地、又以美國而論、平時雖然不甚注意於武備、然因爲國民生產力富足的緣故、一旦參戰、立刻出兵二百萬、一切軍用品、如山如海、送到歐洲、使協約國得最後的勝利、由此可知欲武力的充實、不可不要人民生產能力的充實、如何能使人民生產能力充實呢、至少至少應使人民安居樂業、生命財產自由得所保障、由此可知不說抵抗則已、不說抵抗的能力則已、如其說到、則知抵抗能力的養成、不只是軍事問題、却正是政治問題、社會問題、以上尙專就物質上來說、其實抵抗的能力、决不只限於物質方面於精神方面組織方面、同時注重、古人說過已往不咎、但前事不忘、後事之師、我們不妨舉一爲例、承德的失陷是湯玉麟部不抵抗的結果湯玉麟部一般也有槍砲、也有一切應有的武裝、但是何以不抵抗呢、這是由於種鴉片烟的原故、以種鴉片烟的人而望他會抵抗是不會有這種原因結果的、將帥如此、軍隊自然也如此至於人民、日日被迫種鴉片烟、被迫食鴉片烟、雖欲抵抗、實有不能、於此而望其抵抗、望其長期抵抗、也是不會有這種原因結果的、各位同志已經知道、一樣的軍隊、一樣的槍砲、一樣的服裝、其曾受國民敎育有國民革命軍的精神的、抵抗能力必然較强、反之、没有受過國民敎育没有國民革命軍的精神的、其抵抗能力、必然較弱、我們儘見過物質不如别人而精神過之者得到勝利、决没有見過精神不如人而物質過之者會得到勝利、軍事如此、其他亦然、然則從物質方面說、從精神方面組織方面說、所謂抵抗能力、决不只是軍事問題、而兼是政治問題社會問題所以總括一句話、要充實抵抗的能力、必須從政治上社會上想種種方法去、先充實國民的生產能力、然後再想種種方法、使國民的生產能力能應用於武力、所以今日的最大問題、不只是抗日問題、而是中華民族求生存的問題、必須中華民族有求生存的自覺、及具備生存的條件然後能抗日、所以我們今日不只要有抵抗的决心、尤其要有抵抗的能力、没有抵抗的决心、固然會亡國、没有抵抗的能力、一樣會亡國、興言及此、三百年前亡國的慘象、如在目前、方熊廷弼袁崇煥在遼東與滿洲相持的時候、中國的士大夫、没良心的、不必說了、其有良心稱爲正人君子的、也多是空空洞洞唱着强硬的高調、論和立刻說是通番賣國、論戰則有兵無餉、有將無兵、及至大敵當前、除了以一死報國、更無他法、這等只有抵抗的决心、而没有抵抗的能力、其亡國的結果、思之令人心痛、我們今日决不能再蹈這般覆轍、中國今日抵抗能力的不充分、固無可韓言、但以中國之大、四萬萬人民之衆、說是在物質上及精神上組織上没有抵抗是條件、那也眞是自暴自棄、須知人民不是没有生產能力、祇是没有好好的培養他、甚至反而去摧殘他、所以人民的生產能力、不能發展、如果我們能注意於培養人民的生產能力再注意於使人民的生產能力能應用於武力、則抵抗不是没有把握的長期抵抗不是無希望的、兄弟在病中讀三中全會種種議决案知道三中全會已經將這些方針指示同志及一般國人、今日的必要、不在說話、而在實行、尤其在急急的實行、古人有言、善善惡惡、可以亡國、不是善善惡惡可以亡國、乃善善而不能用、惡惡而不能去、所以亡國、善善惡惡是說話、善善而能用惡惡而能去是實行、一念及此、眞是悲從中來、中國爲什麽不能培養人民的生產能力呢、爲什麽不能將人民的生產能力應用於武力呢、全是有許多惡人從中破壞、從中作梗、固然知道中央當抗日的時候、没有餘力來除這些惡人、但中央决不可存一個遷就的心事、來縱容這些惡人、至少至少應該明正其罪而與國人共棄之、如此則將同心同德的人、結成一團、來担當目前困難、至於那些惡人、由他準備作亡國奴便了、善善能用與否、惡惡能去與否、這是事實問題、但是善善而必求用、惡惡而必求去、則是意志問題、意志如果堅實、不難漸漸變成事實、否則連意志也没有、那就只成爲空言便了、兄弟以爲中央必要不存顧忌切實作去、方纔能使那一班剝削人民以自肥的及分裂國家以自私自利的漸漸不能立足於中國之内、方纔能作得到培養人民的生產能力、及使人民的生產能力適用於武力、國家危急存亡、已到了這般地步、剛纔所說的話似乎過遠但是似没有更切實的辦法、我們只有如此作去、我們不但不能計成敗利害並且不能計我死、只能預備不死在病床上而死在戰塲上、我們縱然不能及身而挽回國難我們總要出一條出路給後我們而死的中國人、使他能養成生產能力、能將生產能力應用於武力、以達到抵抗的目的、求得中華民族的生存、（二下日中央社電）</p>

<p>貧困青年的讀書問題</p>
<p>宜昌龍維揚君訊</p>
<p>接奉復函，承蒙指敎，深爲感謝。可是先生謂，目下的學校都是爲有錢人而設立，而其所敎的亦是替有錢人說話的，你旣然没有錢，這些學校不必去進。是的，不錯没有金錢，又怎能進學呢？可是今日的中國，無錢的人，恐怕要佔全國人口十之八九，無錢就不能升學，那末一般貧困青年不是要演成個個無書可讀嗎？現在我所要請敎先生的，就是：看能不能打破金錢的界限，而爲無錢人找一個有書可讀的機會。至於努务奮鬥，當然没有不成功的一回事，可是無相富的程度，那怕你如何奮鬥，如何努力，也會找不到門徑，於事無濟，爲民衆導師的高明先生呵，請給我一個指敎罷！答：在現在的中國的社會制度與政治狀况之下，一般貧困青年自然没有正式入學讀書的機會，但是，這不是說我們青年就不能讀書，没有讀書的機會，在宜昌，我們不曉得怎樣的情形；我們在上海，就拿上海作比罷。上海一般青年店員與失學的青年，現在就有許多地方，可以有讀書機會。因爲公共圖書館漸漸的設立多了，譬如，我們的流通圖書館每日平均看書的有三百人，此外商會及其牠各處圖書館想亦大致相同。從此推廣下去，人數將來還要多。這樣在社會中豈不是無形中造成了許多自修學授嗎？况且我們又爲讀者特設讀者顧問一欄，以備讀者質疑問難，我們覺得這便是給無錢的青年造成一個有書可讀的機會，其收效並且比正式學校還要大，這是我們所敢預斷的，假使外省各地都照這樣辦，那也不是不可能的事丨足下正可在宜昌努力鼓吹此等事業，所謂已欲立而立人，已欲達而達人一也</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>鼓　勵民氣發揚國光的電影宣傳，比着其他任何宣傳來得眞切和深刻。我國自從九一八以來，電影界中對於抗日寫眞的貢獻，雖然也有相當的成績；但是，比不上愛情艶情奇情俠情：：種種情字雖的影片的勢力雄厚和偉大。</p>
<p>日本軍閥製造了九一八以來的侵略史，同時對於激勵民衆的戰事影片用着全力來宣傳；尤其是他們喧傳的三肉彈，便是一二八廟行之戰，中隊長河野順次部下的三個兵士：丨一，江底下二，二，北川丞，三，作江伊之助，都是懷藏着炸彈，衝動我軍陣地而犠牲者，他們以爲有了這三肉彈，年戰史上光榮的了不得；各家影片公司攝製這三肉彈影片的，新與公司四十一部，閘西公司二十八部，福井公司二十六部，赤澤公司二十二部，河合公司二十部，大日公司十一部，吉川公司七部，松竹蒲公司六部，總計有一百六十一部之多，可見他們對於三肉彈的熱烈崇拜了。</p>
<p>近來，宋將軍喜峯口之戰，也是我們的一頁光榮戰史；願充肉彈的勇士，遠勝於他們的區區三肉彈。五百名大刀隊斫死守城日軍千餘人後，生還的只有二十餘人；似這般的壯烈犠牲，值得全中國影片事業的人們，盡景的替四百數十名烈十製片。他們有了三肉彈，製片百餘部；我們有了四百數十名的肉彈，便是製片數千部也不爲多；爲着鼓勵民衆發揚國光起見，只有盡景的從事於電影宣傳。</p>
<p>再者，三肉彈的姓名，敵人會得表章起來；四百數十名的肉彈，難道聽憑他們做那無名的英雄麽？我以爲壯烈犠牲的國魂，都有表彰姓名的必要。</p>

<p>培德堂，在白蓮涇。牡丹綦盛，有香國花天之號，士女往游，絡繹不絕，一過榖雨，便付諸䈂州一剪，所以俗有榖雨三朝剪牡丹之諺也。</p>

<p>環秀山莊，在申衙前。婪尾花發，占斷風流。</p>
<p>蟠螭山，俗呼爲南山。在彈山西南。山陰多桃，春日望之如錦步幛。</p>
<p>八旗會館，有文徵明手植紫藤，天矯蟠屈，占地數丈，花時繁艶繽紛，如垂瓔珞。對之輒令人追思衡山先生之馨德清標不置。</p>

<p>中　國有句俗語，呌做宰想肚裏好撑船。好（撑船）的肚子，就是很大的了。但這並不是事實，那俗語不過說宰相的量大罷了。</p>
<p>最近閱讀吳翌鳳先生所著之鐙窗叢錄，有一段說道：（安祿山肚郵過膝，重三百五二斤，見姚汝能祿山事迹，及錢希日南部新書。）</p>

<p>— 張寗一</p>
<p>人　爲着有了這樣的（八）二隻眼睛，於是（火就應運而生。</p>
<p>阿毛爲着有了二只眼睛，看見了他媳婦和人戀愛，於是怒火冲天；起而捉姦，阿狗看想了人家大姑娘，於是幹强姦的玩意兒，人家火起，向法庭訴訟，這都是火（怒之謂也）的主動，而替報上平空地添了許多新聞。</p>
<p>但是火以前却聞下了一件禍！明末吳三桂，爲着冲冠一怒，給二百多年後的現在的滿洲僞國種下了一隻根。吳三桂爲着陳圓圓而借清兵，滿人就乘此入主中原，一直傳到漙儀，民國成立，帝國推翻，這位宣統大爺就此蟄居北平，那知現在矮子想擴充地盤，於是揀了漙儀這寳貨去做傀儡執政，以致弄出了所謂滿洲國，你想當時吳三桂一怒，竟然影響到二百年後的中國！</p>
<p>不過火終究是偉大，火燒亦壁是至令傳爲美談，而且在宋朝還引起了東坡先生亦壁夜游的清興，</p>
<p>但，人門對它終是懷着極度的恐怖，可是又不敢遠它，任是一等一的大人物，没了它就得枵腹從公。不過太親近了，一惹它，它就會立刻把你家產捲光，變成一片平地！</p>
<p>在這裏我想起了這火（怒火）在三島近來正燃燒得利害，一般木屐兒爲着莫須有的萬寳山案，竟然火氣冲天，侵佔我東北，設立了傀儡國，更進而佔熱河，但是回顧我國；眞不愧爲幾千年的文化古國，可笑年紀輕輕的副司令，竟是火氣全無？任日人怎樣的蠻横，始終激不出他的火來！至於那行將就木的老不死湯玉麟，更不必說起，本來熟湯無火維持那得不成冷湯呢？火而有靈，對這二位也只有付之一嘆吧。</p>

<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>自　從一二八戰事以後，北站便在日本飛機轟炸下焚燬了。戰事告終，鐵道部想在眞如建造聨運總站，預計以現在北站的地皮售出，充建設新站的經費。那聨運站的規模，自然是異常富麗偉大，需時約計二年，并且因爲聨運站緩不濟急，特地在宋公園路先造臨時車站一所，以資應用。計劃是决定了，臨時車站的地基，也在鋪設了，彭浦鄕的地也圈定了，一切都是準備着。</p>
<p>現在因爲北方的戰事狠嚴重，鐵道部决計將遷移車站的原議，暫時從緩。京滬滬杭甬路局根據部令，於是仍從恢復舊站着手，這個計劃是將被燬的大厦，實行改建，圖樣是這樣的，全部分爲二層，下面一層的地位，照原址大小，上面一憎約佔二分之一。二層之中，還有一個夾樓，外面是看不出的。</p>
<p>這所房子，完全劃歸車務處應用，其餘名處，全已遷到北河南路口的河濱大厦。車務處的支配是將商務方牘兩課設在樓下和夾樓，二樓爲調度課和閱書室。新站建設後，下面尙有酒吧間，公共電話間，商務課的櫃台等，一切採取商業化，矯正過去衙門式的惡習。</p>
<p>新站約摸三個月後可以完成，從此，被燬的舊址，又重新蓋上一座美奐美輪的華厦了。</p>

<p>趙　翁又道：不是我說句放肆的話，大清國亡，就亡在這一點上。清朝的官兒，吃了喝了，什麽富國强兵，替老百姓打算的事，全不管，只是每人每家講些虚套。這要是是兩個月友在街上問好，由大至小，把好問個週，至少也得三四分鐘，這個問一句好，那個照例答應一句好，不問也知道人家是那麽答應着，這不是一套廢話，何必要他。所以我就覺得這個年頭兒，年輕人規矩麻糊一點，没有什麽關係，只要像你娘兒倆一樣，一天到晚忙了做事，這才是天字第一號的好人。大大姑娘别拘謹，吃！說着，就抓了一大把瓜子，塞到桂枝手上來。老王已是進來斟過了一遍茶。桂枝揑了瓜子，身子微蹲了了一蹲向他道謝着。趙翁連連摇手道：說過了，我們不用客氣了。桂枝微笑道：雖然是那樣說着，究竟不能大模大樣的對了長輩。趙翁向江氏道：我說怎麽着，你這位姑娘就是通情達理，能粗能細的人。我家自强，總算是個好孩子，一點没有當兵人的習氣，掙錢也夠養活我的了。可是他有公事在身，父子不能常在一處。他現在雖然是在西苑駐防得好好的，只要上峯有個命令，說聲走，也許今天調防就走，我作父親的人，怎好跟了他走呢？所以我在店裏給人家管着賬，就不願回來。這不爲了别的。在人家店裏，有店東伙計常在一處，就是這樣子混着，一點也不寂寞。我要是不幹了，一個老頭子住家，什麽意思？到了現在，我勉强的讓孩子接了出來，就帶了這樣一個聽差過着。若是我有大姑娘這樣一個在身邊，我就痛快多了。江氏笑道：搬進來不過兩天，老太爺倒說了好幾回這樣的話。要不，高攀一點，把這孩子拜在你面前做個乾閨女罷</p>

<p>我們行過夾道，一條清朗的河流就現在我們的面前，河的那邊是青色的草坪，黄色的芧屋就樹在田的角落裏，幾個穿紅衣服的小孩子，遠望上去好像田裏的果實。我們沿着河走，在河邊一個石磴上坐了下來。</p>
<p>（你聽！枝頭的鳥聲，村外的犬吠，我們的耳鼓很久没有同這些自然的聲音接觸了！）我的腦筋好像被解放了，這樣的對蒂說。</p>
<p>（你看！横在面前的清流，又何嘗不能滌去我們心中的積穢。）蒂目不轉睛的注視着悠悠的流水，太陽照在平滑的水面上，反射出閃耀的金黄色來。</p>
<p>溫軟的和風，向我們身上吹拂着，我低聲唱着：（風：小心一點吹，不要把花吹壞，：）的歌謡。再看看蒂的頭髮，已經給風姨吹亂，我便講一個（風吹散髮）的故事給伊聽。</p>
<p>（欵乃一聲山水緣！）我這裏雖則缺少青翠的山，但碧綠的水也儘夠我們陶醉。我們的小艇一直划向前去，沿岸的溪草，好像傲視着水裏的浮萍在說：（我不像你們，看見船來就得讓開一條路來。</p>

<p>我們一羣伙伴，出發到道塲山，沿途經過陳英士的墓前，去作刹那的憑吊。没有香燭和紙錠，也無酒飯與花圈；祇有在我的手中執着一枝將近漸茁枝端的鵝黄嫰柳，以及我胸中燃燒着的一片熱情。我默默的致意。</p>
<p>我們走了許多不平的石子路，經伙伴的引導，跑進了一戶農家，作片刻的逗留。這農家的中間，在正中懸了五張照片：蔡廷錯，蔣光鼐，戴戟，張治中，陳銘樞，我們民族的英雄，是已深入了民間。無疑地，是獲得了大衆的推崇。</p>
<p>當那一角的紅牆秀露在山腰裏，我們知道就快到了；唯其背着地性吸力，所以遲遲不能走到。那，前面的不是嗎？伏虎禪寺四字已展怖在我們的面前，跑到山門，首先見到的是伏虎大師，相傳這裏有一頭兇猛的老虎，被他征服了，於是給他造起廟來，這裏的歷史是這樣的我們又跑上山的頂點，立在塔的下面：望到渺小的湖州，蜿蜒的公路。而這醉人的春風，又誘惑了我整個的心靈。我們雖然來作春的詢問，可是除了幾陣春風之外，一切依舊在冬的懷抱裏。</p>
<p>當我們跑出山門，牧童已騎上牛背，廟裏傳出了陣陣的鐘聲。和尙，你可知道？（做一天和尙撞一天鐘，依舊是一塲空。）</p>

<p>你　只要是個中國人，你當然知道航空的重要。航空救國，自應人人參加。因此無論女的，男的老的，小的，窮的，富的，都在實行捐錢，購買飛機。</p>
<p>而同時，飛機游覽也實行了。</p>
<p>於是有人花大洋五十元正，在飛機上坐那麽十五分鐘去游覽。</p>
<p>這和那些小職員，小學生，工人們，從生活費裏省下幾毛錢去作航空捐的，自不可同日而語。</p>
<p>但據說是這樣的：際此春光明媚，大可臨空一游，以曠身心。這於身體很有好處。身體健康，庶免東亞病夫之譏，亦爲國爭光之一道。</p>
<p>而且，以前有位女士用自已的天然足在洋鬼子跟前報國，其後國難期間，又有名流絕食，以腸胃來救國，同時又有以良心，用一顆良好的心臟來救國者。是則人身上的東西都可以救國的。因此，身心就非曠他一下不可，曠</p>
<p>好了，以便救國。也是必要的。</p>
<p>所以花了的這大洋五十元正其效果等於航空捐。這種臨空游覽，蓋亦航空救國之一端云。</p>

<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>在　古代神話裏，曾寫者這樣的一段古事：一個樵夫失掉了他的斧子，那是他的唯一的財產，失掉了它，他是等於失掉了生活的路，所以他就跪在山裏，對天呌嚷，希望上帝再賜給他一把斧子，這呌嚷是多麽悽慘哪！可是與這同樣悽參的呌嚷，在現代社會的都市裏我又聽到了。</p>
<p>在一個春天將近黄昏的時候，在工作疲倦之後，我走出房來預備到公園裏去。正在要横過那。寛廣的大街時，我看見在街的對面的行人的路上，擁擠着一羣人。我走進了看，在圍繞着的人羣中，斜着一架倒下了的貨擔子，四外撒着許多破碎的碟碗這個貨擔子的主人，是一個老年人，身上穿着極襤樓的短褲褂，兩條細得如乾柴的腿，是完全裸露着，他的面孔是慘白而瘦瘠得可怕，頭上只頂着幾根稀薄的白髮了。他的這種衰老的可憐的身體，負着一個貨擔子行在這樣都市的熱閙的街道裏，是必定有時要跌倒的。可是那貨擔子，那擔子上的碟碗，那盛着不知是什麽粉團子之類的鍋，便是他的整個的生命，全部的財產了。跌碎了碟碗和破鍋，第二天他將不能再負着那個擔子到街上來了，於是他第二天的生命的米糧也再没有地方去找尋了。</p>
<p>他從地上拾着破碎的碟碗，放聲哭泣着，跳動着，這正是現在都市中的樵夫失掉了他的斧子而對天呌嚷的悽慘的情况啊。</p>
<p>圍繞着他的人們雖然都在同情他，但是没有施捨，當時我摸了摸我的口袋，裏面還恰巧有一個銀圓，我從圍繞着的人羣中，伸出了那拿着銀圓的手，可憐的老人立刻跪在我的面前了，我急忙轉身走開去。</p>
<p>在公園裏散步，我想着這件事；晚餐時，我同着妻談論着這件事；夜深睡在床上，我仍然思索着這件事，而且無論在什麽時候，我一想到它，立刻心情就變成低鬰了。</p>
<p>我的不快，彷彿是因爲這個現代的城市展示了他的罪惡，但是對於這件事，我只看見了一半，我並没有完全的理解：這城市之一的罪惡，我也是只看見了一半，並没有完全的理解。</p>
<p>其後，過了不久，在另外的一條大街上，我又看見了擁擠着的一堆人羣。在人羣裏，是有和上述完全相同的塲景，那個仍然哭跳着的衰弱的老人，我一看便認識了。我凝視着那圍繞着的人羣，那破碎的碗鍋，那哭跳着的老人，我的腦中立刻便發見了一個新的發見，我不知不覺地說：啊，這是一種欺騙呀！一這次没有人施捨，不管那老人的哭呌是怎樣地可憐。停不久，路上的警察來了，他驅散着人羣，命令那個可憐的老人趕緊收拾好走開。老人更大聲地號咷着，警察生氣要逮捕他，老人索性滾在地上不肯起來，我没有忍耐力看完這塲景，我馬上走開了</p>
<p>走在路上，這事苦惱看我的心，這時的不快是更倍於從前了，最初我想，這是一種欺騙其後我想，非行使這樣悽慘的欺驅而便不能生存的那老人，也更是可憐的。這個城市，這萬惡的上海，這個逼迫一個衰弱的老人來行使這種欺騙的魔窟，是應當早日破滅了吧。結果，我後悔，爲什麽在警察未趕到之前，我不再拿出一點錢來帮助那個可憐的老人呢！</p>

<p>那個小脚婦人不理不　的樣子，走向前頭廳房裏去了。海泉便想，何以中國人盡是這樣不親切的，連不費吹灰之力的事體也，不願意替人家帮帮忙。告訴不認識路道的人該走那一條路，都是那樣不高興，不耐煩，也還想活在這世界上麽？中國的各人自掃門前雪，休管他人瓦上箱的哲學實在發達得太厲害了，怪不得在北方的中國人和日本人打着仗，南邊的中國人却和日本外交官杯酒聨歡啊。</p>
<p>海泉一個人逕上二樓上來。二樓的亭子間和前樓房都閂住了。所以夾在中間的樓梯上，没有一絲的光線。他摸索了一會，才稍稍認清楚了樓梯一帶的灰暗的輪廓。他走到前樓房的門首來了，敲了一鼓門。</p>
<p>（是那一個呀？）</p>
<p>像唱歌一樣的女性的聲音他想這無疑地是曹太太了，丨丨那天在敎會裏見過一面的曹太太了</p>
<p>（我。曹世光足在家麽？）</p>
<p>（你是那一個？）</p>
<p>又是像唱歌一樣的聲調，在裏頭問海泉想像得出，曹夫人是對着他的小孩子問的，才發出這樣動人的，有旅律的聲音。</p>
<h3 id="c207">巴黎談屑 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭石君寄自巴黎</p>
<p>（六）震驚一世的天足</p>
<p>天足自然是裸足。但這裏還另帶有一個意思，是說的天女之足。因爲天女之足的魔力眞是厲害。不管她是不是天足祇要是生在天女身上，儘可使人跪在她的面前。從前東方的騒人韻士所稱讚的步步蓮花，那裏是天足。但他們常忠實地告白寗顧拜倒在石榴裙下，西方人也是一樣。雖然他們所崇拜的是天足，但這兩足的所有者不都是天女麽？時不問古今，地不問中外，拜足恐怕是人類的天性。如遇着科學家簡直可以把這事定作一條公例。</p>
<p>可是我去巴黎游藝館Ｍｏｕｌｉｎｒｏｕｇｅ看密斯丹格（Ｍｉｓｔｉｎｇｕｅｔｈ）的跳舞，不禁感到一種意外的驚訝。她是一位世界馳名的舞女，是單用她的兩足積成百萬黄金的巨富。不獨顚倒了整千整萬的巴黎人，就是外貎嚴重的英德人，文明爛熟的意大利人，產生過瘋狂騎士的西班牙人，想用黄金舖滿全地球的美國人，仍至有替人類贖罪的上帝之子的猶太人，都是她的兩足的追隨者。我心裏想，她的兩足旣具有這麽大的威力，她定是一個能用色相救活衆生的天女。但一看到她在舞台上裸着身體一絲不掛地舞躍的時候，與其說是感到金迷紙醉的歡樂，毋寗說是感到貫心徹骨的悲哀。人生丨人生丨電光石火的人生！轉瞬就消逝了！震驚一世的天足的所有者密斯丹格雖然用十萬黄金去作她一隻足的保險費，再加上一隻，自然是二十萬，這數目可使寒傖的東方人吃驚不小，但是她無論如何不能用黄金挽留她的青春。她現在已達六十餘歲的高齡了。她固有驚人的妙技，舞的時候我覺得祖國詩人吳梅村所說的瑣觀音變現身，反腰貼地蓮花吐，還不足以形容萬一。然而冷酷無情的時間，畢竟不能饒恕她，一天一天在她的玉貎上刻上無數縷花紋了。或許因爲我對於跳舞是一個門外漢，我看她奏技的時候，似不如在另一游藝館ＦｏｌｉｅＢｅｒｇｅｒｅ看一君血肉豐潤的少女在舞台上一俯一仰，如同千紅萬紫在春風中招展一般，使我更覺得有趣此她。們富有彈性的腰肢，直線和曲線的交織，盪人心絃的節奏，在識者看來，若與密斯丹格比較，自然有雅俗之分，但我想也不見得就相差到天遠了罷。</p>
<p>果然在我這方面也不乏同調的人。自然穆朗（ＰａｕｌＭｏｒａｎｄ）曾作一文標題爲ＭａｇｉｅＮｏｉｒ宣傳黑人藝術以來，巴黎人對於近東原始民族的舞蹈，遂感到特殊的興趣。而此輩舞女多屬妙齡，當袒胸露臂靜立在舞台的中央，好像青銅色的彫像，有一種沁人心脾的素扑的香澤。竟有某黑女被巴黎人讚之爲黑威預司（Ｖｅｎｕｓ）。而印度舞女伊尼約卡（ＮｙｏｔａＬｎｙｏｋａ）亦曾蜚聲一時。她的舞蹈分爲古代印度舞，近代印度舞，古代埃及舞近代埃及舞四種。她不曾到過印度。她原是印度人和埃及人混合而生的。她的舞衣和舞台設備，都出自她個人的意匠，故另有一番風味。後來純粹的印度人卡爾（ＳｈａｎＫａｒ）姑娘在舞台上作純粹的印度舞，亦獲得相當的成功。其他形形色色的舞蹈，前仆後起，都與震驚一世的天足的所有者密斯丹格爭一日之長。所以現在她的盛名漸和她的年齡一樣，不無日落西山之感了。</p>

<p>粉　市上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平靜之象、以洋麥報價、美坎均小一二角左右、故開市後、人心平平、賣雙方均趨互擯、發展甚難、終因北方之時局轉嚴、各路客帮、又感銀根之奇緊、無心問津、實係自然之勢、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、又趨平疲、本月份河南帮微有回出、小廠則從事抵補、遠期各月份、則大廠陸續抛售、因買戶有限、出數無幾、目下洋麥進口、仍絡繹不絕、因此各廠之抛貨、終未見停止耳、結果本月份較前日小二釐半、四七八月份微好二釐半、五六月份未動、</p>
<p>麥　市上下午開盤後、各月份均趨盤旋停頓之象、洋麥小去一二角、而各方買賣、異常蕭條、凡與無關係之客商、均未問津、所以洋麥雖曾有巨大之上落、市面則盤旋如常、可知市面之無生氣、實非一時所能挽救也、結果本月份至八月份較前週一無出入、</p>

<p>本文爲蘇聨人民委員會軍事委員長窩羅西洛夫一九三三年一月二十日、在莫斯科衛戍軍全體黨部工作人員會議上之報告、譯自一九三三年一月廿四日伊士威斯吉亞報、</p>
<p>蘇聨紅軍之生長與發展、是與普羅國家之生長同時並進、不後於其生產力和技術之發展水平、　實上亦不能不如是、蓋蘇聨現處於帝國主義敵對包圍之中、若無完美與健全之軍備、就一日不能存在、所以蘇聨政府、對於紅軍特别予以注意、同時蘇聨國防、亦不能不在五年計劃上反映出來、</p>
<p>紅軍自有史以來、業已證明其克盡天職、我人屢向全國工農大衆聲明、紅軍爲履行其天職、不拘在何種條件下、絕不許敵人越過蘇聨神聖邊界一步、這一誓詞、確係實言、紅軍之强盛、在於其特殊的政治、與道德地位·精神、以及高度的革命意識、</p>
<p>紅軍武裝、是繼承自帝俄舊式軍隊、而帝俄舊式軍隊、乃爲歐洲最落後者、在革命時期、紅軍武器之改善、僅賴於在作戰中所獲自白衛軍與外來帝國主義干涉軍涉之軍器、在内戰結束後諸年即在恢復時期紅軍武器、仍未得改善、一因蘇聨尙未有足以解决此重大問題之工業基礎、二因舊式軍隊、未遺留下熟練軍事幹部人才舊式軍隊、所有軍器、均係仿造或輸自國外、所以依據新式工業之進步、謀技術上改造紅軍、乃五年計劃在國防方面之基本任務、因而根據新式兵器製造工業之建立、以改裝紅軍亦爲我人工作之中心、</p>
<p>在五年計劃期間、這一方面之成績、不亞於其他各方面、五年計劃末期之紅軍與一九二七二八年時之紅軍、業已大不相同、正有如現在全蘇聨經濟結構與一九二八年時不同一般、</p>
<p>現時紅軍技術之改造、究已達到何種程度呢、</p>
<p>首就機關槍軍器而言、機關槍在現代防禦上之意義、舉世共知、質言之、現代軍隊下級組織、甚至一至小單位、如無各種機關槍充足供用、即無防禦可言、在世界大戰末年及其後、在防守戰中（如防禦步兵、航空及坦克車等之襲繫）、除重機關槍外、尙有手提機關槍、高射機關槍、以及大口徑機關槍等等、亦是此故、一九二八年時、蘇聨紅軍中機關槍軍器、除重機關槍、即舊式馬克辛機關槍外、尙别無所有、即重機關機槍比較起來、亦爲數不多、當時紅軍手機關槍一無所有、所有者爲外國所製各種舊式機槍之類、此種機槍不、惟技術上已屬太舊、且極分散、不敷軍用、因而亦爲戰鬥力很小之軍器、尤其可懼者、當時製造重砲之基礎、也完全没有、</p>
<p>此外、蘇聨富時、自然也没有航空機槍、也没有高射機槍、更没有坦克車機槍、所以我人在五年計劃中、對於軍器改裝之努力、首注意於新式有力的各種機槍兵器之供給、</p>
<p>這一方面之工作、確已獲得了很大成績、上述各種機槍、現在蘇聨均可自造、其式樣不下於國外最新式者、尤其在步槍與機槍之製造和發明上、更訓練了大批軍器技術人才、專家、砲匠·及青年工程師、仍在繼續研究究改良、這些人才、均係由舊日機器工廠工人中揀選而來、現已成爲可靠而富於經騐的軍機技術幹部、其技術知識、足赶上一日千里的歐美技術、毫不誇大的說、紅軍面前所擺的技術上的問題、均可迎刃而解决、現在蘇聨業已發明有新式自動步槍、自動手槍、及其他種新式軍器、此種軍器、蘇聨工廠、已在大最製造、</p>
<p>在五年計劃諸年間、蘇聨不惟創造了新式射擊與機槍兵器、且建立了新式軍用工業、若在敵人進攻蘇聨時、紅軍已有充分的自動兵器足以保證、</p>
<p>紅軍之砲類軍器、以前更劣、砲兵鬥爭用器、在現代作戰中之意義、至爲重要、世界大戰後、資本主義國家軍隊、在改良大砲和砲兵制度上、進步極速、法英意美各國軍隊、其舊式砲兵、幾乎全部新式化、就遠度和速度言、均已達至無以復加之程度、不僅此也、各砲兵隊之關係、亦根本改變、而使用　彈砲數大爲增加、並添用許多新式軍器、</p>
<p>在這一方面、蘇聨紅軍之因難、不下於射擊和機槍軍器、在射繫和機槍軍器製造方面、尙可由老砲匠中、揀選需用的人才、但在大砲軍器製造方面、任何設計也没有、舊式軍隊所留下者、有則已死、有則毫無學識、有則係伊親蘇維埃政權者、於是我人重新訓練襲造人才、設立一設計機關、專司非常複雜和技術上高等熟練的工作、現在蘇聨舊式砲兵、亦已革新、在射程和速度上所獲成績、已不後於現在歐洲新式大砲、不論小口徑砲或各種新式重砲和新式高射大砲、蘇聨均可自造、紅軍下級組織連排、舉凡抵禦坦克車之砲、步兵連排所帶各種特别軍器、與夫防禦敵人短距離機槍巢穴之兵器、都已齊全、</p>
<p>此外、我人又發明了許多新式大砲、試騐結果、有許多成績甚佳、現在蘇聨工廠中、已在大量製造了、</p>
<p>在這一方面主要勝利、究竟何在呢就是在於第一次五年計劃中、蘇聨建立了自造大砲的强大基礎、設立了有力軍械設計局、訓練了軍器製造的熟練人才和工程師、創辦了許多工廠、足以解决紅軍砲兵軍器方面的諸問題、（未完）</p>

<p>— 平</p>
<p>自從妻前天回到母家去了之後，這幾間破舊的屋子裏，祇剩我一個人了。在白天，打開了前窗，還可以聽見鄰家的笑語聲，解除我的寂寞。可是一到了夜之黑幕籠罩着大地時，早睡的故鄕，那孤寂的景象，令人想起鬼怪一類的話。更不幸的我又患了感冒，昏沉沉地躺在床上，心中是忐忑的不安；院子前後，都是靜靜地，從田間偶而而傳來的犬吠聲，使夜更染上了恐佈之色。我輾轉着不能入睡，注視桌上的煤油燈，燈花縮的更小，遠處街傳來打更的鑼聲。</p>
<p>忽然，天井中一陣悉悉地擾動着北畦的草葉，聲音慢慢地移動，停留在屋角上，似乎碰響了洋鐵的水落。鬼，像閃電一様從我眼前掠過，房裏的壁上，四面幌動着獰惡的影子，我蒙了被，又似乎有人從我身上壓來，全身浸出了汗珠，手足已不能自主的行動起來。忽然，（撲通）一聲，重大東西掉進水中般，我努力探出我的頭，漆亮了燈花，想起身探個究竟，然而（鬼），終於不敢向天井探望。</p>
<p>因爲想起了鬼，小時候聽的鬼的故事都湧上心來，好像我臥室的四圍，都有鬼的行動，在恐怖的沉默中，不知經過了多少時候纔入睡。</p>
<p>下一天醒來，還非常困倦的躺在床上，聽到娘姨驚詫的喊聲。</p>
<p>（小花貓溺死在水缸裏了丨）</p>
<p>那是一隻我心愛的小花貓，僅討來了一星期，牠每晚睡在我的房裏，自從患了兩天病來、小花貓已抛出我的記憶。昨夜上，能細細地想這聲音的由來，不乏疑神疑鬼的自擾了一夜。我披着衣走出來，娘姨提了僵了腿的小花貓從</p>
<p>外面進來，好像說（死了），我抱歉地望着牠，要是昨夜大膽地起身，不是可以把牠救活嗎？鬼，疑神疑鬼，輕輕地把一條小命送掉了。</p>
<p>我更相到瀋陽敗績，熱河失陷，不是和我昨夜一樣的有鬼恐嚇在間盋？小花貓雖然暫時不能捕老鼠，但是牠本身旣是貓，至少有捕老鼠的希望在，我竟輕輕地把　小生命犠牲了，我的心像心割似的難受。</p>

<p>— 蔣石槑影</p>
<p>編者先生</p>
<p>我結婚已有六年了，丈夫待我很好。起初四年，我們的情形，不過可以維持罷了。自從去年的夏天之後，我丈夫的事業，非常發達；因此在當年的冬天，搬進了一所一百數十兩租金的洋房，同時還買了一部新式的汽車。照例我的生活，是很快活而舒適了；但是我却自有我的心事。我的娘家，境况是很困難；我共有兄弟姊妹八人，除了兩個姊姊和我，已經嫁了之外，尙有三個弟弟和二個妹妹，他們還在學校裏念書。我的父母，實在有些支持不了。並且我的兩位姊姊，嫁得平常，所以論理我應該津貼我娘家的家用，或帮助弟妹的學費。但是我的父母，是欺善怕惡，而且勢利不過的人。所以他們在我丈夫未發達之前很欺侮我，並且對於我的丈夫，也待得不好。現在他們因爲要我津貼他們，就翻了轉來，待我非常殷勤。時常向我借用汽車，並帶哭帶求的要我津貼他們每月一百元的家用。我不願將我丈夫以汗血換來的金錢，去津貼這種勢利的娘家：但我又不耐煩他們這種帶哭帶求的舉動。請你答復我吧，我正在此難題之下等着呢！專此即請</p>

<p>編者按：人情勢利，自古已然。昔蘇秦未遇時，也弄得（妻不下紉嫂不爲炊父母不與言）。後來他身掛六國相印，將說楚王，路過洛陽的時候，就一父母郊迎三十里，妻側目而視，側耳而聽，嫂蛇行匍伏，四拜自跪而謝）。但是我們從未聽見，說蘇秦因爲他的父母兄嫂妻子，在他不遇時，虧待於他，所以對於他們，有報復的舉動。蔣夫人與蔣先生，以前即使受了些委屈。現在你們發達了，他們因爲有求於你，曲意相從，他們内心的慚恧，已經足夠懲戒他們了。你念着骨肉之情，大不該介介於心，一報還一報呀！萬一你的丈夫，因爲究竟隔了一層，記起前情，不肯照拂他們，你還得從旁勸解。安有父母兄姊之間，可以採用（有怨必報）的政策呢！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>其中有（萬里紅）（秦樓）（香妃）等等　的請客票，有紙幣似的轎飯票，有女人用的粉紙，有旅館和菜館的賬單；最驚心觸目的，却是幾方每一個墮落者所必具的當票。丨追歡取樂，好夢初醒後的唯一的紀念品。</p>
<p>（哼！）母親氣得臉也白了，這一晚，她足足哭了一夜。伍逸不由想到了他的祖父，和他臨死時候所說的話，心上也覺得很難過。第二天起，居然做了一星期的安分良民</p>
<p>一星期後，女人的電話，期友的慫恿，又漸漸地的不寗靜的心弦不過他爲免使他老母傷心起見，决意把公開行動改爲秘密行動。每晚，打過一點鐘，他照常不動聲色的準時回家，故意先做一些聲悉，讓他母親知道自已已回來了：好在他是躺在亭子間裏的，在床上假睡了一會，便悄悄地溜下樓去啓門而出。不過在下樓的時候，他必須先除去了脚上的皮鞋，踮起脚尖，慢慢地一步的挨下樓去，到天亮回来的時候，也是如法泡製。</p>
<p>這樣偷偷摸摸的又過了一年多的墮落的非人生活。某一個晚上，他照例又溜出去度他的倚紅偎翠的甜密的春宵，一直到七點半鐘才興盡賦歸：睡眼朦鬆的推開了亭子間的門，很困乏地喘了一口氣，正待卸下衣服來，忽然眼前覺得多了一件東西。</p>
<p>打窗外射進來的魚肚白的曙光之下，很糢糊地顯出有一個臉公灰白，雙眼發直的老太太，暈倒在深紅色的地板上，一手還堅握着一張珠寳店的一百二十元的發票。</p>
<p>伍逸像觸了電氣一般地全身格格的抖着，他已感悟了，他已清醒了：但是，他的可憐的母親是永遠不再站起來了　　㈥三個朋友</p>
<p>『小伍，現在還怕什么？今晚在「明珠」那裏！』伍逸的母親死後不到一個月，一班不願同日生，但願同死的墮落朋友，更不管他身上穿的還是孝服，腳上套的還是麻鞋，便又有一個一個的挨上門來，嬉皮笑臉的慫恿他去繼續幹那「墮落尚未成功，同志還須努力」的工作。在他們，對於伍逸母親的死，眞覺得是伍逸的一椿天大喜事，差一些就要向他道喜。</p>
<p>但是，伍逸已澈底的覺悟了。他知道從今以後，再沒有人可以翼護他了，將來的成功，或是失敗，都系在自己每一步的行動上。因此，他便悍然反進臉來，把這些不成材的朋友大罵一頓，亂棒逐去，一個人冷清清地獨自在家裏守了四十九天。</p>
<p>這一天，乃是他痛遭大敵後重復又回到星報館去工作的第一天。自己也不知道爲什么緣故，一走進編輯室，臉上便覺得熱刺刺地像犯了絕大的虛心病一樣的羞愧萬分，以致於連向同事們招呼的勇氣也沒有了。</p>
<p>他埀了頭，委尷尬地在公事桌邊坐著一瞧桌子上，已積著很高的一疊信件：逐一看去，倒有一大半是請吃花酒，約上賭場的催命符。還有幾封是朋友請求他刊登宣傳消息的，其中祇有一封是向他表示哀悼的信函。</p>
<p>這是他的老同學王玉麟所寫的，王玉麟進去的歷史，也並不怎樣光榮，可是他對於伍逸的墮落，卻並非促成者之一，因爲他在Ｘ大教育科畢業之後，便上日本去研究法律，二年畢業回來，便忙著開辦律師事務所，因此他各伍逸確已久無接觸了。這一封信倒不是伍逸所能逆料的，尤其是他信裏的為詞句的懇切，竟使伍逸大爲感動。</p>
<p>「明天決意去看他！」伍逸把許多信看完之後，便埀著頭，默默地暗忖著。</p>
<p>「尊駕便是伍逸先生嗎！久仰！久仰！」不知道在什么時候，伍逸對面的座位上，已添了一們新同事。一個臉色　黝黑，身材很強健，戴著一副大號的羅克眼鏡的青年人。——這個人瞧伍逸不就和他招呼，便堆著笑，自己先開始敷衍起來。「兄弟趙千里，曾在美國本雪文尼亞大學研究過心理學，最近回國，便蒙這裏張ＸＸ先生找來，充當國際電訊的編輯。以後還得常請伍先生指教！」</p>
<p>一個已經吃進多年的花話旗麪包的朋友，竟能這樣底謙恭；伍逸對於趬　千里，不覺便起了一種好感。於是雙方話匣大開，倒像是舊雨重逢一般；繁重為不知怎樣，他們底談鋒忽然移到了交朋友的問題上去。、</p>
<p>「朋友在現代，科是成了利益交換器」。趙千里用每一個心理學家所常有的冷雋的神情，像演講似的說道：「如果你沒有錢，沒有勢力，便一輩子休想交朋友；或者也有人竟肯降尊遷資的來俯就你，那末不是�府上有什么值得他顧戀的古董，或是　盜，一定是你有一個美麗的夫人的作怪了！」</p>

<h3 id="c283">老鼠畫作家　華德狄史耐軼事 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 鏡若</p>
<p>吾想常看影片的人總看見過在正片前所常開映的老鼠畫片的罷？這種片子是很生動滑稽而富有興趣的。這種畫片的創造者華德狄史耐，好像本刊已經介紹過。吾現在就把他的軼事叙述幾則，想亦好愛看他片子的諸君所樂聞的吧？他本來是在一家煤油公司服務的，因爲他對於諷剌劃滑稽畫等好像很感到興趣，所以常常作畫消遣。他先爲加薩斯的影戲院作了一張諷剌畫影片，後來又連續作了幾張諷剌童話片預備在敎堂和學校裏去開映，可是没有成功。這時他祇　了一條褲子，一件絨繩外衣，一具影片攝影機。可是他並不灰心，他把攝影機賣了四十塊錢跑到好萊塢。他的兄弟是在好萊塢當小販的，他不問情由就把他兄弟所儲蓄的二百五十塊錢拿來做資本，再從事於繪畫。這一次總算是成功的，牠的興趣立刻得到了人們的認識。</p>
<p>當他爲環球影片公司製片的時候，公司中人嫌他太糜費，忽然把他的合同取消。這時他適在紐約，他不忍使他手下的二十個助手就此失業。他立刻組織了一個華德狄史耐影片公司。</p>
<p>他現在總算大大的成功了。不過他的所以孜孜的從事於這事業倒不是想發財，僅僅是爲了興趣而已。有一次。有一個朋友問他做富人的滋味如何。他祇回答說（吾不知道，吾並没留心這些）。這是實在的，他並没說謊。他現在仍住在他十年前所住的一所英國式舊屋子裏。</p>
<p>可是他的成功也不是偶然的，他實在是具有天才的。他小時候對於動物和繪畫就很感到興趣：五歲時就開始作畫。拿濃厚的柏油當做墨水，白色的牆作紙。他家中所有的書都被他畫上許多詐多的畫。</p>
<p>他現在還常到動物園中去攝取動物影片作爲假日中唯一的娱樂。他的夫人時常訴怨似地說她是一個老鼠寡婦。</p>
<p>他對他手下所雇用的人員眞寛厚極了。他總極力設法使他們的生活舒適他爲他們預備着種種的設置。他讓他們拿着優厚的薪水僅做些少事情。這樣的雇主吾想眞是少有的，也祇有他這樣不以賺錢爲目的的人可以做到的吧</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>結構尙佳意義毫無</p>
<p>導演技巧純熟　南京映</p>
<p>這裏有一個比較曲折的故事。</p>
<p>有百貨商店之女職員名海綸者，撫其姊之這子二人。一孩因盜牛乳喂貓而被捕，庭訊時，一少年律師知其爲海綸之甥。蓋海綸爲律師舊時之愛人，因此二情人得相會。英後律師因惡貓而罪及二孩，而海綸却愛之如已出，二人終致决絕。最終律師因訟事而過盜，得救於二孩，於是二情人得以團圓而愛及二孩。</p>
<p>在這樣的一個故事中，編劇者是很運用了一些思想的。他將全篇的劇情，穿揷得相當嚴密，没有勉强之處。雖然有許多笑料，但是並不生硬得使人厭煩。最好的是他動員了成千成百的兒童，這在好萊塢的影片中乃是别開生面的。但他爲什麽要編製一個這樣的劇本呢？用意在什麽地方呢？這是我們百思不得其解的。所以本片是完全没有什麽意義，祇是在他的腦筋中構思了一個這樣的劇本罷了。</p>
<p>但是導演在這一片中的運用，到是很靈活而純熟的。他將不必要的關鍵儘可能的簡單化，使觀衆在簡短的鏡頭前，對於全劇的進行得有明白的了解。他對於两個小孩的表演，特别注意，不到十歲的裴斯德菲爾斯（ＢｕｓｔｅｒＰｈｅｌｐｓ）在他的指揮之下，能夠有這樣難能可貴的表演，當然得歸功於他了。同時他對於重要的關鍵，輒能顯出他的聰明：譬如當一個孩子越窗外遁，致打翻臉盆而碎然作響，當盜聞聲而入時，而二孩却臨機應變的將强盜作弄一番。這雖然也是笑料，但是却很聰明。至於警察之來捕盜，也是來得很自然的，然而這也是編劇者嚴密之處。</p>
<p>在表演方面，雖然本劇將吉姆士鄧（ＪａｍｅｓＤｕｎｎ）和蒲斯瑪洛蘭（ＪＢｏｏｔｓＭａｌｌｏｒｓ）担當之主角，但是表演却很不庸而且所担當的任務亦不見如何重要。至於那小孩兒斐斯德菲爾斯却是非常好的。他是那麽逼眞而活潑，這使主角不能不爲之遜色。</p>
<p>燈光，佈景，收音，均不見特色，可是剪接却還新巧。</p>
<p>整個說來，這不是一部怎樣好的片子，但是也還可以看看。</p>

<p>— 華明</p>
<p>我們影戲看多了之後，在看某一部片子之前，不必知道劇中人是誰假如銀　　有　個　　的　　脚穿破皮鞋走着八字式的步位，頭上戴一令狹邊的黑帽子，一望就知道是卓别靈·一個瘦子合一個胖子在一起打諢的一定是勞萊哈台·一隻手常在掠頭髮的一定是琵琵妲妮兒·穿了條裙子像散開的摺扇，時時回顧衣服的一定是珍妮蓋諾·比認面目還準，决不認錯的。在銀幕上，每個演員有每種習慣的表情，我們可以細細的記起來。這種表情的成功，大槪分二種原因，第一種因爲故意做作而成爲習慣，像卓别靈，勞萊，哈台是·第二種是天然生成的習慣，像琵琵妲妮兒珍妮蓋諾是·現在把各個演員的習慣動作大約記下：</p>
<p>曼麗特蘭漱像雨淋雞般抖擻；曼麗畢克馥的捲曲着拖得很長的黄金髮；瓊克勞馥起起路來很急，步子很大：李琳甘熙目不邪視：克萊拉寳拖着亂的頭髮頓着足：安哈婷走路時，手不時拉衣服；琪恩哈羅走路凸起臀部，頭從肩上回過來裝着笑，葛萊泰嘉寳抬頭抑視。</p>
<p>男演員中克拉克蓋博多笑，范朋克舉手表示勇敢，李却狄克斯肌肉突起牙齒咬緊裝出天不怕地不怕的神氣，華萊斯皮雷獰笑抓耳，湯密克斯在他的馬湯尼的耳旁說話，李却白塞姆斯咬緊牙牀表示兇猛，李昻巴里穆爾摇頭擺耳像一只關在籠中兇猛的熊，約翰巴里穆爾昻然直立，傲氣凌人；魯意史東灣着腰善於奉承，亞道夫孟郁笑時眉花眼笑；裴斯開登冷氣凌人；雷門諾伐羅目不他顧的看女人；亞爾喬爾生跳起舞來脚不着地；羅克從眼鏡中睜大了眼睛裝出驚嚇的腔調，希佛萊歪戴草帽。有許多習慣的動作能使人引起興趣，像卓别靈裴斯開登等，然而祇限於諢角，至於别的角色就有令人生厭的。所以有幾個演員像海倫海絲瑙瑪希拉等都已改除習慣的動作，所以找不大出來。</p>

<p>又是一部爲大衆呐喊，緊跟着時代表現的片子，那就是聨華新片一都會的早晨了。</p>
<p>王人美女士在（都會的早晨）裏扮的是純樸活潑的村姑，天眞爛漫，活潑可愛。高占非扮的是窮苦的私生子，他那勇武健美的體格，恰合他扮的挣扎在痛若的生活裏的苦力。演到在暴風雨之夜，明白了自已的身世，像瘋了的恶麽般，直奔生父家裏時的一段，使觀衆的心弦，隨着劇中人的心神而緊張震盪。</p>
<p>這片子的劇情很曲折，而且緊凑動人，自始自終，没有一點沉悶的地方。青年導演家蔡楚生在導演界也有歷史，他的導演（都會的早晨），也許不會令人失望吧。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Enemy Forces Fiercely Attacked Luowenyu Again Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Liu Ruming's Troops Met the Enemy Head-On in Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Also Occurred Outside Tangjiakou Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Multiple Enemy Planes Flew Over Malanyu and Zunhua to Reconnoiter and Drop Bombs</p>
<p>Japanese Dispatch Claims Kato Ensign's Entire Platoon Was Annihilated</p>
<p>Beiping – The enemy outside the Luowenyu Pass, after being bravely repelled by Commander Liu's troops, gathered and reorganized in the Banbishan area, increased their reinforcements, and secretly plotted a counterattack. Commander Liu's troops, having received the report, were prepared. At dawn today, under the cover of artillery and airplanes, the enemy launched another large-scale fierce attack on our positions. Our troops met the enemy head-on and fought bravely, disregarding their own safety. As of 2 PM, the fighting was still intense. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin – The enemy in the Xifengkou area, at dawn on the 20th, used over twenty heavy artillery pieces to fiercely bombard our positions in the Tangjiakou area. After some time, over two thousand Japanese infantrymen, along with over a thousand Mongolian and puppet soldiers, pressed toward our positions. The battle was extremely fierce. Our Zhao Brigade's Third Battalion launched a counterattack from the left flank of our positions. After an hour of intense fighting, the enemy's momentum was greatly thwarted, causing their flank to waver. Our front line took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce counteroffensive. The enemy, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated in disarray to the highlands north of Tangjiakou. In this battle, two enemy captains and over three hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed. Dozens of our officers and soldiers were wounded. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – The enemy forces have been fiercely attacking our Luowenyu, Longjingguan, Sanchakou, and Shuiquanyu positions for days. After our Song troops, led by Commander Liu Ruming, bravely met the enemy, the enemy forces repeatedly used airplanes and artillery to cover their assaults on our various front lines, engaging us in several hand-to-hand combats. The enemy forces suffered extremely heavy casualties. Currently, most of the enemy's remnant troops have retreated to Pingquan, while a portion remains stubbornly defending Mengziling and other places. Outside Xifengkou, our Zhang troops are still defending the Panzikou and Xifengkou front lines. Commander Liu's troops are firmly defending the Luowenyu, Longjingguan, Sanchakou, Shuiquanyu, and other key mountain passes, confronting the enemy. After the enemy outside the Luowenyu Pass was repelled by our forces yesterday morning, they did not dare to come again until nightfall. However, several enemy planes flew over our Malanyu and Zunhua areas yesterday afternoon and this morning to reconnoiter and dropped bombs, killing many civilians. It is anticipated that the enemy will increase the deployment of large numbers of reinforcements and launch another large-scale counterattack along various passes of the Great Wall. Fierce fighting is expected in the coming days. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – Song's Beiping dispatch on the 19th stated that the enemy facing the Luowenyu Shanzhayukou launched a full-force attack on our positions last night. A certain division commander personally went to the front line, directing his troops to resist desperately. A certain brigade commander led troops from the Shabao Yukou to launch a flanking attack on the enemy's rear near Kuaihuolin. The enemy detected this and fired fiercely on us. Our officers and soldiers, disregarding their own safety, charged into the enemy's lines with drawn swords, inflicting countless casualties. At the same time, our division commander, seeing the enemy lines wavering, ordered all units to launch a full-scale offensive, attacking from both sides. After a day-long bloody battle, the enemy in the Kuaihuolin, Sandai zi, Zhengbei yu, Gushanzi, Shui yu, Madaogou, and Huanghuayu areas was completely cleared. Currently, there are no enemy traces within ten miles north of Luowenyu. According to reliable reports, large numbers of reinforcements have arrived in their rear and are showing signs of moving toward our left flank. Orders have been issued to pay special attention and guard against their counterattack. In the Xifengkou area, there were only small-scale skirmishes by guerrillas last night. This morning, three enemy planes dropped over a dozen bombs at Saheqiao Santunying, injuring several civilians. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – Liu Ruming's 19th dispatch from Beiping stated that at dawn yesterday, the enemy again used over twenty artillery pieces to cover several thousand infantry in a fierce attack on our Luowenyu positions. After our regiment met the enemy head-on and dealt them a heavy blow, they were unsuccessful. Subsequently, they increased their infantry and, with the aid of airplanes and artillery, changed their attack to our Shanzhayu positions. Our newly reinforced brigade used over thirty machine guns to strafe, killing many enemies. They attacked our Shanzhayu thirteen times in one day, but all were repelled by the brigade. At night, our regiment again launched a flanking attack on the enemy's rear from the right wing. The brigade also pushed forward fiercely, engaging in a night of fierce fighting. The enemy was unable to withstand the pressure and retreated over twenty miles at dawn, constructing fortifications. It is reported that more troops are continuing to arrive in the enemy's rear, attempting to attack our Lengshuitou, Da'ankou, and Malanguan. We are on high alert, vowing to have the determination to coexist with the enemy, to die for the nation. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency) – The Japanese Suzuki Force began a general offensive against the Chinese army in the Luowenyu area this morning. Fierce fighting is currently underway. (20th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – Frontline dispatches state that at 10 AM on the 19th, seven enemy planes arrived in Zunhua County and dropped over twenty bombs, injuring or killing 98 residents. Our army suffered no losses. According to refugees who fled from outside the pass, the enemy committed rape, looting, and pillaging along the way outside Luowenyu Pass, causing the people to harbor deep resentment. Therefore, when the enemy retreated on the 19th, many of the supplies were abandoned on the ground by the porters. Currently, our army is dispatching scouts to investigate. Another dispatch stated that the fierce fighting outside Xifengkou is almost similar to the situation in the Shanghai Battle last year. Our front-line positions have been attacked repeatedly by the enemy and have been defeated each time. Later, they used the old trick of attacking Liuhé from the side, copying the Shanghai battle tactics, and launched a surprise attack on Luowenyu, Malanyu, and other places. Fortunately, we discovered this early and deployed defenses in those areas in advance. As soon as the enemy arrived, we launched a counterattack using night assault tactics. The enemy was caught unprepared and suffered heavy losses. In the past two or three days, the enemy in Luowenyu has been demoralized and is currently waiting for reinforcements. Our Liu Ruming Division has high morale. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – Shang Zhen telegraphed, stating that due to the tension at the front line, he would not return to Baoding for the time being. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – Zunhua telegraphed that there were no enemy traces in Shuiquanyu, ten miles outside the Great Wall. The Gubeikou line has been in a state of stalemate for days. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Kato's Unit Completely Annihilated <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency) – The Ayazé unit, belonging to the Hattori unit, was trapped in a heavy encirclement by the Chinese army in Lamadong and Mangniuyingzi. After three days of fierce fighting, a platoon of Hokkai soldiers died in the battle. This was the platoon commanded by Ensign Kato, which was ordered to occupy the 346-foot high ground in the hands of the Chinese army. At 8:30 PM on March 4th, taking advantage of the moonlight, Ensign Kato led his subordinates, consisting of ○○ machine gun teams. At 2 PM on the 5th, they charged into the position of over three hundred Chinese soldiers. Ensign Kato's unit suffered seven or eight wounded, and the machine guns were destroyed by Chinese mortars, demonstrating the intensity of the battle. At this time, Ensign Kato was shot in the right leg and injured, but he was very calm. He temporarily retreated the seriously wounded and the machine gun team and sent important documents to his affiliated regiment. He then desperately defended the position with only six or seven remaining subordinates. However, due to the fierce firing of the Chinese army, Ensign Kato was shot five times and sustained three stab wounds by 5 PM that day and died in battle. None of his subordinates survived. When the news of Ensign Kato's death reached them, all members of the Hattori unit wept. Ensign Kato was from Yamagata Prefecture and graduated from the Army Officer School last year. He was a young officer, only twenty-four years old this year. (20th)</p>

It is requested that the rear quickly find a way to transport them. Various groups in Beiping City are currently coordinating actively to find ways to transport them. The People's Self-Defense Association sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting that a number of convicts from the Reformatory be assigned to the front lines to work as stretcher bearers. The Public Security Bureau has now assigned fifteen people, led by Qi Naihe, to depart for the front lines. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Eleven Tanks, Eighteen Artillery Pieces</p>
<p>Over Six Thousand Rifles, Thirty-Six Machine Guns</p>
<p>Tianjin – Song Zheyuan's army is exceptionally brave in resisting Japan outside Xifengkou, and has captured a lot of booty, including 11 light tanks, 6 armored vehicles, 18 artillery pieces, 6,477 rifles, most of which are the Han Linchun type from the Northeast Arsenal, 2,340 pistols, 36 machine guns, 4 Japanese military flags bestowed by the Japanese Emperor, and one aircraft. As for war horses, rations, steel helmets, military knives, and water bottles, they are piled up like mountains, and the number has not yet been ascertained. Also captured were over 2,700 Mongolian soldiers, over 1,800 Korean soldiers, and over 6,420 Japanese soldiers. Each soldier had a talisman hidden on their body. When Song's army faced battle, they vowed, "If we don't kill ten enemies this time, we will never return alive." When the broadsword teams entered the enemy's lines, the blades flashed everywhere, and the heads of the Japanese fell to the ground. The Japanese army had a superstition that if they were killed by a broadsword, they could not escape reincarnation, so many knelt on the ground and begged to be spared from being killed by a broadsword, willing to be shot. The war booty obtained by Song's army is worth over ten million yuan. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Course of Operations Outside the Pass</p>
<p>Ten Fierce Battles, Enemy Forces Suffered Heavy Losses – Considered Greatest Losses Since Meiji Era – Enemy's Invasion Plan Discovered – Failure to Curb Will Lead to Invasion of North China</p>
<p>Beiping – Song Zheyuan said, "The enemy's plan was to take Xifengkou and then go to Pingjin after taking Rehe. Unexpectedly, on the first day, they were repelled by our army at Xifengkou. The enemy's Hattori and Suzuki brigades, combined with Mongolian cavalry, gave a two-day deadline to take Xifengkou. Fortunately, our army generals and soldiers gave their lives, advancing without retreating, and the enemy was ultimately unsuccessful. Our officers and soldiers all had the determination to die, and they were united. Even though the enemy's guns and cannons were superior, it was useless. Therefore, since contact, the enemy has suffered repeated heavy blows. After the enemy failed to attack Xifengkou, they detoured to attack Dongjiakou on the right flank and were defeated by us. The enemy retrieved corpses, counting six corpses per vehicle, a total of over 120 vehicles. In the Battle of Laopo Mountain, we killed over 600 enemy corpses, and the bones piled up like mountains. We detoured to attack the enemy's artillery positions and killed over 700 enemies. Two enemy infantry and cavalry regiments were completely annihilated. In total, enemy casualties were over 3,000 and under 5,000. After the fighting at Gubeikou stalled, the Japanese military in Luanning mobilized, intending to detour to attack Luowenyu and take Zunhua. If this route is taken, Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Lengkou, and Yuguan will all be surrounded. The enemy reconnaissance found that our garrison in Luowenyu was only one battalion, because our soldiers obtained a letter from a Japanese soldier to the captain of the 31st regiment, informing them of their surprise attack on Luowenyu. We urgently transferred two brigades to secretly reinforce the defense. The enemy attacked Luowenyu with over 2,000 Japanese soldiers and over 3,000 mixed Mongolian and Korean puppet troops. They were repelled by us on both days. Subsequently, the enemy transferred reinforcements to attack, and we engaged in multiple hand-to-hand combats for a mountain, fighting fiercely for several days. The enemy ran out of weapons and food and retreated yesterday, with over 1,000 casualties. The Japanese military reported to their home country that there had been no such major losses since the Meiji Restoration to train soldiers. From the 9th to the 19th, we fought fiercely for ten days before the decisive battle ended. The Japanese aircraft factory is located in Pingquan, and although there are 50 to 60 aircraft, they are of little use. It is estimated that only over a hundred of our soldiers were injured or killed by enemy aircraft bombings after the great battle. Yesterday evening, around 5 PM, they sent aircraft to drop over thirty bombs on Zunhua City, injuring nine civilians and two soldiers. Based on current military strength, the enemy near Xifengkou will definitely not succeed. We searched the body of the enemy artillery regiment commander who was killed and found maps and plans for invading our country, not only invading Pingjin but also Qingdao and Shandong, which are all within their invasion plan. If we do not use troops to stop their ambition at this time, it will inevitably invade North China. This time, I met with Chiang Kai-shek in Baoding and also made a major decision. We are determined to step forward steadily and press forward again. The people who die for killing the enemy will live even in death. If we lose the country without firing a shot, the world will not regard us as human beings. I plan to meet He Yingqin and return to the defense area tomorrow." (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Resumption of U.S.-Soviet Relations and the Obscurity of Japanese-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>(I) The Abnormal Relationship Between the United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The United States' recognition of the Soviet Union and the resumption of normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union have recently become one of the world's focuses. Most people in the United States tend to pay more attention to domestic issues, especially the so-called prosperity of the market, and are not very concerned about general world issues. Furthermore, the Monroe Doctrine is its traditional foreign policy. The countries of the European continent owe the United States more than 10 billion in war debts, and there is a lack of full understanding and experience of them. Let alone the Soviet Union, which is a unique new country in this era, it is normal that it is not easily understood. However, the discord between the United States and the Soviet Union, the fact that the United States has not yet recognized the Soviet Union, and the absence of diplomatic relations, while there are personal exchanges, besides the emotional clash, the Baku oil field stock issue is the real focus.</p>
<p>However, factual needs and the force of the general trend make it impossible for individuals or a small number of people to forcibly prevent it. Therefore, even if there are no diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union to guarantee, and the Soviet Union is clearly governed by communists, the trade between the United States and the Soviet Union has the greatest risk on the surface, and the safety of capital will hardly be guaranteed. However, since the consolidation of the Soviet Union's national foundation and the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, its trade with the United States has improved daily. The reason why American goods exported to the Soviet Union fell to 24 million rubles last year was probably due to market competition from Britain and Germany, and economic panic was also a factor in the decline of trade. However, the United States' desire to open up markets to reduce the tide of its economic panic, restore past prosperity, and seek a new balance of capitalism has not been forgotten for a moment. Moreover, the main industries of the American industrial sector are mostly heavy industries such as steel and machinery, and what the Soviet Union urgently needs is also machinery, steel, and the technology of advanced capitalist countries. This is precisely what the United States has in abundance and is eager to export. However, the situation on the European continent is most noteworthy. First, Hitler is in power, acting arbitrarily, and strongly denouncing the Treaty of Versailles. He also demands equality in the matter of armaments. In international relations, he is mainly allied with Italy, which will develop into a fascist international organization. However, he is still secretly working with financial capitalists to form the highest stage of financial capital dictatorship. In domestic construction, he still cannot avoid following in the footsteps of Papen's economic policy. The Weimar Constitution (democracy) will retire, and harsh and ruthless blows and suppression will be imposed on the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party. Its main purpose is to stabilize Hitler's regime. Although the Soviet Union is not as deeply resentful as the Treaty of Versailles, the Soviet-German relations will not proceed as smoothly as in the past. The fact is very obvious that the future Soviet-German economic relations may be affected by political and diplomatic unrest and fall into stagnation. At a time when the United States is encountering</p>
<p>obstacles everywhere, war debts are difficult to recover, foreign investments are frozen, and the financial panic has not ended, can it not seriously consider the resumption of U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations? There are still more serious problems than those with Western Europe, namely, the Far East problem. The fact that Japan and the Soviet Union already have diplomatic relations and that China's invasion indirectly gives the United States a great blow to opening up the market in China means that the United States should carefully consider its way out.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Japan and the Soviet Union in a Three-Legged Stool <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>It is well known to the world that the relations between Japan and the United States are gradually deteriorating, and there is no need for you to describe it. It is especially clear that exclusive occupation and annexation and equal sharing of interests cannot coexist. If the current system exists in the next few years, this kind of conflict will inevitably not be resolved. At the same time, if China cannot stop this kind of hegemonic military action of the Japanese imperialists with an iron fist, then Britain, the United States, and France will have to temporarily stand by and watch. Even if the United States is extremely angry and extremely disgusted, it will only be angry and disgusted. In addition, it cannot take any further effective action, fearing that this will cause serious consequences and bring unexpected disasters. Therefore, Japan was able to expand the September 18th Incident to North Manchuria, with the intention of seizing the Chinese Eastern Railway as its own. In the past year, although the Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested the signing of a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty, Japan has insisted that there must be exchange conditions, and the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway is one of its important terms. How can the Soviet Union recognize this? However, Japan also has a reason for holding this position. First, its invasion of the Northeast is also appealing to the capitalist countries of the world, saying that it is to prevent the southward invasion of communism and maintain peace in the Orient. Second, it is said to suppress the redification of China, protect the safety of the Far East market, and establish Japan's so-called lifeline. At the same time, when Yosuke Matsuoka passed through the Soviet border, he stayed in the Red Capital, Moscow, for a week to exchange views with Soviet Union's top leaders, seeking understanding between Japan and the Soviet Union. Kojiro Matsukata also bought a lot of red oil, further promoting Japanese-Soviet friendship in fact. From this, it can be seen that Japan is trying to use the close relationship with the Soviet Union to maneuver among the nations, seeking to seize the northern territory of China. However, the Soviet Union has not yet made a definite statement. Judging from past events, it will continue to be cautious and will not act rashly. Its quiet observation is still continuing.</p>
<p>The United States' resumption of relations with the Soviet Union has some political implications. Relations with Japan are very important, but the actual relationship is probably more economic and less political (diplomatic). Because at this time, the United States is in a hurry to seek economic balance, and if the surplus heavy industrial goods can be sold in the Soviet Union, it is also a way to restore prosperity. Although the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan is said to be successful, it is only the initial construction. After that, it will undoubtedly devote itself to domestic development. Therefore, even if the United States and the Soviet Union resume diplomatic relations, even if the rift between Japan and the Soviet Union deepens, it will have an impact on Japan's invasion, but it still cannot stop the Japanese army's rampage and reduce its military adventurous advance. It is feared that it will become even more violent and reckless.</p>

After Wang got off the train, he immediately took a car to the Central Party Headquarters to attend the Memorial Week report. (Twentieth Day Central News Agency Electric Report)</p>
<p>Nanjing: After attending the Memorial Week, President Wang returned to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways to rest. At 10:00, he attended an important meeting held by the Central Government. Chairman Lin, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Shaokuan, Luo Wengan, and others attended. The meeting adjourned at noon. Chu Minyi said that Wang's diabetes was slightly more serious than when he was in Singapore. Whether he will resume his position as President of the Executive Yuan depends on his physical strength. However, regardless of whether he resumes his post or not, he will definitely be responsible to the Central Government. Whether Wang will go to Baoding to meet Chiang or Chiang will return to Nanjing is still undecided. (Twentieth Day Central News Agency Electric Report)</p>
<p>Nanjing: At 10:00 am on the 20th, the Central Party Headquarters held an important meeting. Wang Jingwei, Song Ziwen, and various important figures in the Central Government in Nanjing attended. It is reported that there were secret discussions on national defense, foreign affairs, and other issues. (Twentieth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for the Premier at 9:00 am on the 20th. Chairman Lin, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, and others participated. President Wang reported, the original text said: Chairman, fellow comrades, I took the train this morning to participate in the Memorial Week. I originally wanted to listen to the speeches of the Chairman and fellow comrades, but the Chairman wanted me to say a few words. Although I was not prepared, the Chairman's intention was probably because I had been out for a few months and now I have returned, giving me some opportunities to meet with fellow comrades. So I had to say a few words. Recalling a few months ago, the Central Government, considering that my illness was serious, gave me a few months' vacation to go to Europe for treatment. I am sincerely grateful for the Central Government's kindness. But when this country is in crisis and existence is at stake, fellow comrades are working hard and striving hard, while I am leisurely lying in bed, which is really uneasy. When the bad news of Shanhaiguan came, I had to return to the country in a hurry before my illness was cured. On the way, I received the bad news of the fall of Rehe, which made me even more worried. Then I got the news that Comrade Chiang Kai-shek went north to supervise the army, and the soldiers of all fronts worked together to support the front line. I was a little comforted by the sorrow and indignation. Considering the hard work and sacrifice of the soldiers on the front line and the difficult cooperation of the comrades of the Central Government, I was infinitely terrified from comfort. I would like to pay my deepest respect to the soldiers on the front line and the comrades of the Central Government. What do I want to say? To this day, there is nothing to say except the word resistance. Of course, resistance and negotiation go hand in hand, but the fundamental principle for dealing with the current situation must first be resistance, and then negotiation. The recent resolution of the League of Nations shows that Japan is an aggressor and China is the victim of aggression. The justice of the world has not been completely lost. This is the result of negotiation, that is, the result of resistance. From today onwards, the more effective the resistance, the more hopeful the negotiation. Otherwise, there is no negotiation to speak of. Therefore, our only way out today is resistance. Speaking of resistance, it seems to contain a lot of meaning. First of all, we must have the determination to resist, and secondly, we must have the ability to resist. Today, no one in China should not have the determination to resist. This is self-evident. Now</p>
<h3 id="e19">Photo of President Wang Arriving in Beijing <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>What needs to be said is only the ability to resist. What is the ability to resist? The most obvious is military force. But where does military force come from? First of all, materially speaking, our weapons are very scarce. This is well known. Guns, cannons, ammunition, and all military equipment are not as good as the enemy's. Our soldiers on the front line are almost flesh and blood, fighting the enemy's scientific weapons. To talk about strengthening the ability to resist, the first is to strengthen weapons. This is beyond doubt. But where do weapons come from? Is the ability to resist limited to weapons materially? China claims to be a country based on agriculture, but according to the customs figures of last year, the total value of grain imports reached 300 million taels. We, China, a country based on agriculture, have to spend 300 million taels every year to buy foreign grain. Without these grain imports, the Chinese people would starve to death. If they starve to death, even if they have weapons, they will not be able to fight. It can be seen that the ability to resist is not limited to weapons materially. The poor Chinese have to spend 300 million taels to buy grain to avoid starvation. Then where is the spare money to manufacture weapons or even buy weapons? It can be seen that the ability to resist must also take into account all aspects materially. Modern countries usually focus on production and develop the productive capacity of the people. When it comes to war, they use the productive capacity of the people as much as possible for the resistance of military force. Therefore, the greater the productive capacity of the people, the greater the resistance of military force. Taking Russia during the European War as an example, it did not focus on the productive capacity of the people at ordinary times, but only on the strengthening of military force. Therefore, it was defeated when it fought against Germany. Taking the United States as an example, although it did not pay much attention to military preparations at ordinary times, because the productive capacity of the people was sufficient, it immediately sent 2 million troops and all kinds of military supplies, like mountains and seas, to Europe, so that the Allied countries won the final victory. From this, it can be seen that if you want to strengthen military force, you must not do without strengthening the productive capacity of the people. How can we make the productive capacity of the people sufficient? At least, at least, the people should live and work in peace, and the lives, property, and freedom of the people should be guaranteed. It can be seen that if you don't talk about resistance, it is already over, if you don't talk about the ability to resist, it is already over. If you talk about it, you will know that the cultivation of the ability to resist is not just a military issue, but a political issue and a social issue. The above is only about the material aspect. In fact, the ability to resist is by no means limited to the material aspect. Pay attention to the spiritual and organizational aspects at the same time. The ancients said that the past is not to be blamed, but the experience of the past is a teacher for the future. We may as well give one example. The fall of Chengde was the result of the non-resistance of Tang Yulin's troops. Tang Yulin's troops generally had guns, cannons, and all the necessary armaments. But why didn't they resist? This is due to the reason of planting opium. It is impossible to expect someone who plants opium to resist. The generals are like this, and the army is naturally like this. As for the people, they are forced to plant opium and forced to eat opium every day. Even if they want to resist, they really can't. It is also impossible to expect them to resist and to resist for a long time. Fellow comrades already know that the same army, the same guns, the same clothes, those who have received national education and have the spirit of the National Revolutionary Army must have a stronger resistance ability. On the contrary, those who have not received national education and do not have the spirit of the National Revolutionary Army must have a weaker resistance ability. We have seen many times that those who are inferior to others materially but superior in spirit have won victory, and we have never seen those who are inferior in spirit but superior materially win victory. This is true for military affairs, and it is also true for other things. Therefore, from the material aspect, from the spiritual aspect, and from the organizational aspect, the so-called ability to resist is by no means just a military issue, but also a political issue and a social issue. So, in summary, to strengthen the ability to resist, we must think of various ways from the political and social aspects, first strengthen the productive capacity of the people, and then think of various ways to make the productive capacity of the people applicable to military force. Therefore, the biggest problem today is not just the problem of resisting Japan, but the problem of the survival of the Chinese nation. The Chinese nation must have the self-consciousness to seek survival and possess the conditions for survival before it can resist Japan. Therefore, we today must not only have the determination to resist, but also have the ability to resist. Without the determination to resist, the country will perish. Without the ability to resist, the country will also perish. Speaking of this, the tragic scene of the country's perishing three hundred years ago is as if it is in front of us. When Xiong Tingbi and Yuan Chonghuan were confronting Manchuria in Liaodong, the Chinese scholar-officials, the unscrupulous ones, need not be said. The conscientious ones, known as gentlemen, were also empty and sang a strong high tune. Arguing for peace was immediately said to be colluding with the enemy and selling the country. Arguing for war, there were soldiers but no pay, and generals but no soldiers. When the great enemy was in front of us, there was no other way but to die for the country. These people only had the determination to resist, but did not have the ability to resist. The result of the country's perishing is heartbreaking to think about. We must never repeat this mistake today. The insufficient ability to resist in China today is undoubtedly undeniable. But with the size of China and the population of 400 million, to say that there are no conditions for resistance in terms of material, spirit, and organization is really self-defeating. We must know that the people do not lack the productive capacity, but they are not well cultivated, and even destroyed instead. Therefore, the productive capacity of the people cannot be developed. If we can pay attention to cultivating the productive capacity of the people and pay attention to making the productive capacity of the people applicable to military force, then resistance is not without certainty, and long-term resistance is not without hope. I read various resolutions of the Third Plenary Session while I was ill, and I know that the Third Plenary Session has already instructed these guidelines to comrades and the general public. What is necessary today is not to speak, but to practice, especially to practice urgently. The ancients said that to reward good and punish evil can destroy a country. It is not that to reward good and punish evil can destroy a country, but that to reward good and not use it, and to punish evil and not remove it, is why a country is destroyed. To reward good and punish evil is to speak, to reward good and be able to use it, and to punish evil and be able to remove it is to practice. Thinking of this, I am really filled with grief. Why can't China cultivate the productive capacity of the people? Why can't the productive capacity of the people be applied to military force? It is all because there are many evil people who sabotage and obstruct it. Of course, I know that when the Central Government is resisting Japan, it does not have the spare energy to eliminate these evil people, but the Central Government must not have a compromising mind to condone these evil people. At least, at least, it should clearly state their crimes and abandon them with the people of the country. In this way, people with one heart and one mind will unite to bear the current difficulties. As for those evil people, let them prepare to be slaves to the country. Whether to reward good and be able to use it or to punish evil and be able to remove it is a matter of fact, but to reward good and be sure to use it, and to punish evil and be sure to remove it, is a matter of will. If the will is firm, it is not difficult to gradually become a fact. Otherwise, even the will is gone, and it will only become empty words. I think that the Central Government must not have scruples and make it real, so that those who exploit the people to enrich themselves and divide the country for their own selfish interests will gradually be unable to stand in China, and then they will be able to cultivate the productive capacity of the people and make the productive capacity of the people applicable to military force. The country is in a critical state of survival. What I just said seems too far away, but it seems that there is no more practical way. We can only do this. We must not only not calculate success or failure, but also not calculate my death. We can only prepare to die on the battlefield instead of dying in bed. Even if we cannot save the country from disaster in our lifetime, we must always find a way out for the Chinese people who die after us, so that they can cultivate productive capacity and apply productive capacity to military force, so as to achieve the purpose of resistance and seek the survival of the Chinese nation.

<p>Nanjing: Wang Zhaoming returned to Beijing on the morning of the 20th to attend the Central Memorial Report, and returned to the Ministry of Railways' official residence to rest. At 10:00, he went to the Central Party Headquarters again to convene an important meeting. Lin Sen, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Luo Wengan, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Guofu, Zhang Ji, Chen Shuren, and more than 20 others participated. The meeting adjourned at noon, and Wang returned to his residence for lunch. At 1:00 pm, Tang Shengzhi, Zeng Zhongming, Peng Xuepei, and the heads of various ministries and commissions visited him. Foreign Minister Luo also visited him at 2:00 pm and discussed foreign affairs issues until 2:00 pm before leaving. According to Wang's words to reporters, he has not yet recovered from his illness, and he still intends to ask the Central Government to have Song Zhen replace him as President of the Executive Yuan. It is undecided whether he will go to Baoding to meet Chiang. At present, there is only concentration of strength and unity to resist Japan. There is no other opinion to say. Zeng Zhongming also told reporters that Wang has not recovered from his illness and still needs to see a doctor. If he resumes his position as President of the Executive Yuan at this time, it is feared that the symptoms will worsen again. If he then retires again, it will inevitably cause criticism from the outside world. Therefore, Wang is determined not to resume his position as President of the Executive Yuan. Wang will be responsible for presiding over major plans in the Central Government in the future. Chu Minyi also told reporters that Wang's diabetes is more serious than when he was in Singapore. Whether he will resume his post depends on his physical strength. According to another report, Wang needs to meet and discuss major national plans with Chiang. The issue of resuming his post will be completely decided after the meeting with Chiang. (Central News Agency Electric Report on the 20th)</p>

<p>Yu Youren Reported</p>
<p>Absolutely Will Not Compromise With the Enemy</p>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government held a memorial week at 9:00 am on the 20th. Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Niu Yongjian, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Yongbin, Chen Daqi, Li Yuanding, Lin Xiang, Chou Ao, Chen Zhuo, and more than 500 staff members of the National Government attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Yu Youren reported, entitled "Comforting and Encouraging the Patriotic Soldiers on the Front Line," briefly stating, "This report can be said to be a foreign proclamation. Before the report, there is a proclamation. First, there is a proposal. We should burn incense and offer it to the heroic and magnificent soldiers since September 18th. They are so loyal to the meaning of life that they have sacrificed so generously. We pay our respects and wish the glory of the country and nation to be immortal with their glory. Dear soldiers on the front line, you are defending against foreign insults with blood and flesh, protecting the country and nation with spirit, and striving resolutely and continuously to preserve justice for the world and seek peace for mankind. We are not divided into the front and the rear, fighting on the same battlefield against the same enemy, demanding the war debts of our blood and flesh from the tyrannical enemy. The victory of this war will definitely belong to us. Since the September 18th Incident, the Republic of China, which had begun to move towards peaceful construction, has suddenly suffered violent invasion, and the land, people, and sovereignty have all been trampled upon. Countries around the world are all indignant for us and give us righteous assistance. After more than a year, we have reached the point of recognizing that we cannot tolerate it and cannot retreat. At this time, we can only resolutely send troops to punish the thieves. What can be reported to the front is that all those in the rear are working together with one heart and one mind to unite and resist insults, and all those who can help the front are doing their best. Under the supervision of world justice, we will never compromise with the enemy, preferring to be jade broken rather than tile complete. We have made up our minds today. Thinking of the continuous domestic wars of the past 20 years, it is really unfair to the heroic soldiers who have only encountered the real enemy today. Now, in the name of the country and the nation, we present to you the comfort goods and wish you to persevere in this glorious and grand comfort goods to win the inevitable victory."

<p>European Quadruple Cooperation</p>
<p>Aims to Enhance the Spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact for Lasting World Peace. MacDonald Departs Yesterday via Paris to Return Home. Italian Plan Delivered to French and German Ambassadors for Consultation.</p>
<p>Rome - A public statement was released today, regarding the talks held last night and this afternoon between British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It stated that after discussing the general situation, the British and Italian authorities studied a plan to seek understanding on major political issues. This plan was initiated by Mussolini, its purpose being to gain the cooperation of the Western powers of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany to enhance the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, issue a declaration renouncing the use of force, and seek lasting peace in Europe and the world.</p>
<p>Rome - British and Italian sides are unwilling to comment further on the precise meaning of the aforementioned joint British-Italian statement. However, it is understood that Mussolini's initiative, which seeks understanding among the four powers, has already been conveyed to the French and German ambassadors stationed in Italy. Mutual consultations among the four powers will be handled by the heads of government, hoping to resolve major issues that could trigger significant conflicts in Europe at any time. It is reported that this plan is merely a method of contact and does not contain specific measures for resolving these issues. The revision of treaties currently occupies a large part of the discussions between the British and French authorities, while disarmament has barely been discussed. At 6:30 PM tonight, the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary paid a visit to the Pope, talking for 35 minutes. The British delegation is scheduled to depart for London tomorrow afternoon, with a brief stopover in Paris. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon are expected to arrive in Paris at 10:00 AM tomorrow. They will have lunch with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour at the British Embassy. At that time, British-French talks will begin. The British delegation is scheduled to return to London on Wednesday to participate in the debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons. The debate in the House will involve not only the Sino-Japanese dispute but also the talks in Geneva, Paris, and Rome. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Alignment of British Views</p>
<p>Rome - British Prime Minister MacDonald received reporters today, stating that regarding the conversation with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recorded in last night's statement, no additions or speculations should be made. The discussions mainly concerned the situation in Europe and various issues and were of an exchange of information nature. He and the Italian Prime Minister will continue to cooperate to find a solution acceptable to all parties, ensuring peace in Europe for at least thirty years. The British Prime Minister did not say, "I feel that the entire atmosphere of Rome has undergone a spiritual change." The characteristic of the talks between the heads of state of the two countries was the alignment of their views. Both sides are now considering a method to achieve understanding on major political issues, broadly similar to the plan Mussolini expressed in his speech in Turin last October, which closely aligns with the British viewpoint. As for the phrase "no use of force" in the statement, it was already mentioned in the five-power agreement of December 11 last year, which requested Germany to rejoin the Disarmament Conference. Clause 3 of the agreement states that the British, French, German, and Italian governments are prepared to join the solemn declaration made by European countries, that under no circumstances should any country rely on the use of force to resolve current or future disputes among the signatories.

<p>Rome - British Prime Minister MacDonald's personal efforts in Geneva and Rome to salvage the Disarmament Conference have led him to believe that a general European agreement can be reached. Before departing for Paris, MacDonald told a Reuters reporter that now is the time to seize practical opportunities rather than engage in fantasies. The most important thing now is to seek a compromise between France and Germany. MacDonald also said that rumors of an agreement already being in place are unfounded. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>Rome - The Hungarian Foreign Minister stated to reporters today that after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, he firmly believes that Hungary's foreign policy inclination towards the East in 1927 and its close understanding with Italy are entirely appropriate and correct, and can be called an important asset in the restructuring of European politics. (Guomin News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, during his meeting with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon, proposed that Italy, Britain, France, and Germany sign a new peace pact to maintain peace in Europe. This proposal is now being studied by the four countries. If all agree, it will be signed in Rome with a solemn ceremony. Today, the Italian Prime Minister and British officials met for a long time at the British Embassy, explaining the details of his plan. Afterwards, a public statement was issued stating that after the leaders of the two countries exchanged detailed opinions on the overall situation, they studied Prime Minister Mussolini's proposed plan for understanding on larger political issues, hoping to gain the cooperative efforts of the four major Western powers to enhance the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the declaration renouncing the use of force, and to promote lasting peace in Europe and the world. The details of Mussolini's plan have not yet been released, but it is said to share many similarities with MacDonald's previous plan. If the new pact is established, it will be called the Four-Power Pact for Maintaining European Peace. The first chapter will identify the participating countries, followed by a summary of the principles of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, adding sanctions for those who attempt to incite armed conflict. It is also rumored that French Prime Minister Daladier and German Chancellor Hitler will be invited to Rome soon for similar discussions. Once all four countries agree to this proposal, the Italian government will send representatives from the three countries to Rome to formally sign the new pact, which will be named the Mussolini Pact or the Rome Pact.

<h3 id="e24">Not Incompatible with the League of Nations <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Rome - The most important point in the British-Italian talks is that Mussolini put forward a completely unknown plan. The only thing that has been discussed so far is the preface to this plan. This plan has already been communicated to the French government before the meeting. What the British cabinet members will discuss with the French authorities after arriving in Paris next Tuesday is this plan, but with British opinions added. Mussolini's intention is to have the four major powers preside over Europe. Judging from yesterday's meeting, it can be seen that Mussolini's intention is not incompatible with the nature of the League of Nations. Therefore, the main part of the Italian plan can be used to reform the international organization and make it more solid. Since Japan left Geneva, this matter is easier to handle because the permanent members of the Executive Council are only four countries, and these four countries are the four major powers referred to in the Italian plan. As for the other countries, the British cabinet members do not intend to exclude them from participation, but if the major powers can reach a compromise first, the other countries will be more likely to agree. In addition, Britain has a strong reaction to German Chancellor Hitler's violence. The Italian Prime Minister is well aware of this, so he specially advised Germany with a friendly attitude to reassure Britain. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>

<p>Paris - The Times correspondent in Rome commented on the British-Italian talks, saying that Mussolini and MacDonald have agreed to lead Europe into a trend dominated by the four major powers, excluding all countries that have consistently supported French policy. In Rome, a speculation is increasingly believed that MacDonald is mediating, persuading Mussolini to advise German Chancellor Hitler to exercise restraint and adopt a peaceful attitude. However, Germans in Rome fear that Mussolini is secretly beginning to get closer to France without informing Berlin. The rumor that German Chancellor Hitler will visit Rome at the end of this month or the beginning of next month originated from this. In addition, some people deliberately spread rumors that Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya will meet with MacDonald specifically regarding the Hungarian issue. Others say that MacDonald has suggested consolidating the Locarno Treaty to allow France to agree to substantial disarmament.</p>

<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Navy Department still opposes the British new disarmament proposal, stating that while the plan may be needed in Europe, Japan cannot accept any disarmament proposals in the face of the urgent situation in the Far East. (Hualian News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - As a result of the Japanese naval authorities considering the attitude of the Japanese Navy towards British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan, the following items were decided, and a telegram was sent to the Japanese delegation in Geneva to prepare for submission to the General Disarmament Committee: (1) Japan does not recognize the necessity of the security guarantee issue. (2) Japan advocates disclosing the holdings stipulated in the Washington and London Treaties for naval armaments, therefore opposing the convocation of the 1935 World Naval Conference. (3) Japan reserves its opinion on whether to support or oppose the issues of the complete abolition of aircraft carriers and the land and sea military strength until the two issues are decided. (4) Japan opposes limiting the weight of aircraft to three tons. (5) The original proposal limits the maximum number of aircraft for Britain, France, Italy, and Japan to 500 each, but Japan expresses opposition before the above issues are resolved. (6) The Japanese Navy requests the Disarmament Conference to review the Japanese disarmament proposal submitted last year. (Japan United News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 20th - Treasury Secretary Woodin issued a statement on March 16, declaring that the commercial buying and selling of silver is not subject to restrictions, but restrictions will be imposed on those who hoard it. However, it is difficult to distinguish between hoarding and commercial use. Therefore, in terms of President's Proclamation of March 5, the status of silver is still in doubt and requires official clarification. At the same time, according to official sources in Washington, the extraction, transfer, or export of silver is not restricted.</p>

At present, the differences between the two houses in the beer case have been resolved by the consultation committee, and it is expected to be finally passed on Monday. The rural relief plan proposed by the President is also expected to be passed on Thursday. The bank reform plan will definitely be discussed as soon as possible and is currently being drafted, which will include provisions sufficient to prevent recurrence of this setback. After the establishment of this plan, all current business restrictions on resumed banks can be lifted. As for banks that have not resumed business, it will still be determined based on their ability to repay debts.</p>

<p>Elaborating Political Views in Detail</p>
<p>New York, 19th (Havas) - President Roosevelt's new book, titled "Looking Forward," serves to publish his political and economic views, with particular emphasis on the League of Nations and the US financial situation. Roosevelt stated, "While we are striving to improve our economic position, such improvements are difficult to sustain if the world's resources are not more fairly distributed." Regarding the world's experience of panic, the President said he hoped that all suffering countries could make concessions to overcome difficulties and avoid commercial stagnation. Roosevelt reiterated that countries worldwide should send representatives to a conference on commercial issues, and the United States would participate. However, this should not be interpreted as the United States joining the League of Nations, as even with US membership, it could not help the world avoid war. International difficulties, even with US participation, could not be resolved according to the main ideas underlying US policy. The League of Nations has not developed along the lines anticipated by its founders; its major member states would rather sacrifice large sums of money to engage in armaments than use it to develop commerce, balance budgets, or fulfill their contracts. Roosevelt also said that people use their bank deposits for speculation, and such speculation is encouraged by the government. He advocates stopping this speculation and finding ways to discourage people from engaging in it. He firmly believes that economic thinking will soon undergo fundamental changes. In the future, we will focus on the interests of consumers, not just producers.</p>

They intended to throw them at Hitler's car as it drove out of the airport. The Police Chief also stated that this assassination plot was quite dangerous because if even one grenade was thrown and missed, Germany would fall into indescribable chaos, and the planned large-scale program would emerge and could not be stopped.</p>

<p>Alleged Acts of Sabotage at a Major Power Plant</p>
<p>Moscow, 19th (National News Agency) - Regarding the arrest of four British engineers in Russia, the Russian authorities have announced that the reason for their arrest is that they sabotaged the large generators of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the largest power plant in Soviet Russia. The large generators were manufactured by the well-known Vickers company and were installed under the supervision of the engineers. However, traces of acid damage to the machine were subsequently discovered, rendering the machine unusable. Although it has been repaired, six large generators are still unusable.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Havas) - The Soviet authorities have arrested British engineers from Vickers, accusing them of sabotage and counter-revolutionary activities. This matter has caused strong resentment in Britain. Tonight, a British company to which the arrested engineers belong formally declared that the charges against the engineers were only seen in the newspapers. The Soviet government said that the electrical company's water turbines were damaged by sand or acid. It should be noted that water turbines are large objects, and millions of liters of water flow through them every day. Even if someone put sand or acid into the car, it would be washed away by the water and would not damage the machine parts. This matter must be a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Washington, 19th (National News Agency) - According to well-informed sources, unless the situation in Cuba becomes more serious, the US government does not want to intervene and completely restore constitutional rights. At this time, President Roosevelt only wants to achieve the necessary reforms through informal diplomatic talks. It is reported that American secret detectives are closely monitoring the activities of Cuban exiles outside Tampa, Florida. According to news from the Cuban Revolutionary Party, the next revolutionary movement will use airplanes to bomb Cuban fortresses, with Florida as their aircraft base. Although the United States has enacted neutrality laws, Cuban exiles have organized a large organization, raised huge sums of money, and sent people to aviation schools to practice. However, it is not known whether they have purchased airplanes. According to the US Secret Service, the plan to bomb Moro Fortress from the sky as the start of a national uprising was planned by these revolutionary parties. Since President Roosevelt's election, he has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from Americans asking the Cuban government to intervene, but Roosevelt still has no intention of intervening.</p>

<p>Enemy Changes Offensive Strategy After Defeat at Xifeng, Our Song Unit Fights Bravely to Break Through Enemy's Second Line of Defense, Great Sword's Divine Power Captures Three Enemy Commanders Alive</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence - The enemy's attacking force in Rehe totals seven brigades. The Motegi Cavalry Brigade has been defeated by Sun Dianying. The Hattori and Suzuki brigades were eliminated by Song Zheyuan. Four brigades are distributed in Chifeng, Chengde, Rexi, and the various passes of the Great Wall, and their forces are insufficient for distribution. It is reported that a division has been transferred from inside the Pass to reinforce them, having landed in Dalian and heading to Rehe for combat. Meanwhile, Commander Mutō has transferred the Fifth Regiment of the Guyi First Brigade and the Thirty-first Regiment of the Hayakawa Stop Brigade from Chengde, combined with the elite of the cavalry artillery, totaling approximately 5,000 men, to launch a fierce assault on Malanguan and Luowenyu from the Banbishan and Foye Ridge areas, in an attempt to retaliate. Therefore, along the Luowenyu line, the Japanese army launched a general offensive on Sancha on the morning of the 17th with heavy troops, and the intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. According to Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Military Commission who returned to Beiping from the front, the fierce battle unfolded as follows: The Japanese troops attacking Rehe originally planned to break through Xifengkou and Gubeikou, attempting to occupy the various passes of the Great Wall. The Japanese Hattori Brigade attacked Xifengkou, and our Zhao Dengyu Brigade launched a night attack on the 10th, eliminating the enemy. The Japanese army changed its strategy, transferring the main force from Chengde to launch a fierce attack on Luowenyu. At 8:30 this morning (17th), the Japanese army launched a general offensive on Sancha Mountain with a brigade. Most of the Japanese artillery bombarded the mountain with volley fire. Two companies of our infantry defending the mountain fought bravely under the enemy's fierce artillery fire. From morning to noon, the enemy fired over 500 shells. Our Division Commander Liu Ruming personally led the pistol battalion to reinforce and dispatched a regiment along the mountain path to attack from both sides. At 1:00 PM, our army attacked into the enemy's defense line. Both sides engaged in close combat, using guns, bayonets, and broadswords in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese soldiers were defeated and retreated across the line. Commander Song learned of the tense situation in Luowenyu in a certain location and rushed to the front line from a certain location. More than 40 Japanese airplanes strongly bombed our positions, and the sound of booming artillery could be heard throughout Zunhua and Su County. At 2:00 PM, I separated from Commander Song and returned to Shijiazhuang by car. Commander Song notified the Shijiazhuang telephone bureau in advance to invite me to talk. Commander Song reported on the phone that our army had attacked into the enemy's second line of defense and captured three Japanese commanders alive. Currently, they are engaged in fierce fighting in the second line of defense. Enemy troops were discovered in Dongjiakou yesterday morning (16th) and have been repelled. During this time, the Japanese army at Xifengkou launched a fierce attack on the defense line. At that time, Wan's troops retreated. As soon as our army arrived at the defense line, Japanese armored vehicles and tanks charged. One of our battalions charged bravely, and no one survived. On the night of the 10th, our Brigade Commander Zhao Dengyu personally led his troops in a night attack, wielding his sword and killing many Japanese soldiers. The sword was already bent and has been brought back to Beiping by the inspection team from the Beida front line and will be displayed at the museum. Currently, the officers and soldiers at the front line have been awake for seven days and nights, enduring hardships. Soldiers climb mountains and run at night, and their shoes have been worn out, exposing their toes. When enemy planes come, our army lies hidden in the mountains. Many wounded soldiers were left at the front line, but transportation is difficult due to a lack of cars. After returning to Beiping, I will visit Minister He tomorrow (18th) and go to Baoding to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek tomorrow night to report everything.</p>
<p>Another report stated that the enemy who invaded our Xifengkou, after being severely attacked by our Song Zheyuan's troops for days, dare not attack our position again. Considering this to be the first extraordinary shame and humiliation suffered by Japan since the Meiji military training, the punishment received can be imagined. According to a certain staff officer who returned to Beiping from the front line, the reasons for Song's unit's victory are roughly three points: (1) The general's determination is firm. After Song's troops arrived at the front line, he gathered his troops and stated generously: "The enemy is pressing forward step by step, and it has reached its limit. Without strength, there is no justice. To resist, you must first have determination. Yue Wumu said, 'Eat the flesh of the barbarians while hungry, and drink the blood of the Huns when thirsty.' This is the time. If we meet the enemy, we must have the determination to advance without retreat and die." He personally wrote these eight characters to inform his subordinates. (2) Unified command and cooperation. At the beginning of the war, Song ordered Feng and Zhang's divisions to each draw a brigade to encircle the enemy's rear and launch simultaneous attacks. All units were able to obey orders and bravely advance without delay, so they could achieve their goals. (3) Soldiers are brave. The soldiers of this unit are well-trained, and the general's command is appropriate, so they can sacrifice themselves and kill many enemies. (18th)</p>

<p>Achievements in Governing Chahar</p>
<p>Promoting Water Conservancy, Encouraging Well-Drilling. Emphasizing Culture, Rectifying Transportation. Pacifying the People, Searching for Bandits</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence - Since the fall of Rehe and the alarm in North China, Song Zheyuan, who has repeatedly defeated the Japanese army, has commanded his troops to bravely kill the enemy, greatly boosting his prestige. We already know Song's bravery in governing the army. Yesterday, I met a certain gentleman who is currently the secretary of the Chahar Provincial Government, who spoke of Song's achievements since taking office as Chairman of Chahar. Although the time has been very short, his achievements are worth mentioning. Here is a summary of the main points:</p>
<h3 id="e62">Encouraging Well-Drilling <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Chahar Province is high and has few rivers. Whenever there is a lack of rainfall, the suffering of drought is immediately felt. Not only is there no water for irrigation, but even garden vegetables are often left to wither. Even drinking water is insufficient, and there is not a well to be seen for three or five miles. This situation is even worse in the Mongolian banner areas. After Song arrived in Chahar, he ordered the Construction Department to vigorously advocate well-drilling, hoping to conquer nature with manpower and create great benefits for agriculture. The measures are: (1) County chiefs, directors of construction bureaus, and district and village chiefs are responsible for encouraging people to drill wells. The number of newly drilled wells in their respective jurisdictions is the most important standard for their performance evaluation. (2) Those who vigorously promote encouragement and people who voluntarily drill wells will be rewarded. (3) Rewards are divided into four types: recording merits, issuing commendations, awarding plaques, and medals. Therefore, the number of newly drilled wells recently is very large.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Rectifying Transportation <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Chahar's transportation industry has gradually developed in recent years. Song paid more attention to management, so provincial and county highways were built in sequence, and roads for motor vehicles were also built. The dredging of river channels and the addition of bridges are also proceeding in order. Currently, long-distance telephones within the province have been vigorously reorganized, which is much more efficient than in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Searching for Bandits <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The bandits in Inner Mongolia have long been famous. In the Chahar-Suiyuan area for over ten years, people have been killed, raped, and abducted by bandits every day. After the K Army was withdrawn due to the outbreak of war last year, bandits took the opportunity to carry out large-scale activities, gathering thousands of people, wreaking havoc across the four borders, breaking cities and occupying land. In addition, there have been frequent droughts, floods, frosts, and hailstorms in recent years, and many people have been forced by the environment to become bandits. After Song entered Chahar, he sent teams to suppress and capture bandits, repeatedly capturing ringleaders, such as Black Face Yao San and Ma Shangbian, who were all experts in the field. They were successively arrested, either brought to justice or pacified and returned to civilization. Combining both force and leniency, and using it properly, if given time, it should not be difficult to completely eliminate the bandits and allow good people to live in peace.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Han Fuqu <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Goes to Baoding to Meet Chiang</p>
<p>Chiang Sends Jiang Bocheng to Jinan to Invite Him - Special Train Passes Through Beiping to Baoding</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - Chiang Kai-shek's representative, Jiang Bocheng, arrived in Jinan from Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 18th because he had important business to discuss with Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuqu. Province Chairman Han Fuqu, Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, and others all went to the station to welcome him. After Jiang got off the train and exchanged pleasantries with the greeters, he went to the Jiaoji Hotel for talks. According to Jiang's account of his mission to Jinan, this trip was undertaken on the order of Chairman Chiang to invite Chairman Han to go to Baoding in order to discuss national plans with Chairman Chiang. He also said that he had originally gone to the Beining Line from Beiping at 2:30 PM the day before (16th) to comfort the troops. He returned to Beidaihe early yesterday (17th) and returned to Tianjin with Pang Bingxun that night. Pang went to Baoding to meet Chairman Chiang, and he came to Jinan to meet Chairman Han and had already negotiated the trip to Baoding. Set off tonight (18th). On the front lines, our army has repeatedly won victories. Xifengkou, Gubeikou, Lengkou, Dalinghe, and Shihe have all taken the upper hand, and morale is very high. There is no movement in the direction of Yu Pass. After Zhang Hanqing resigned from the Military Commission branch in Beiping, Minister He took over. The staff has not changed. Office Director Rong Zhen resigned due to illness and has been replaced by Bao Wen. The rumor that I will take over as Office Director is absolutely untrue. Public affairs are not a matter for one person. We should now strive to eliminate the ills of "one emperor, one courtier."</p>
<p>Since Han Fuqu was invited by Chiang Bocheng on orders and negotiated the trip north with Chiang, he immediately ordered Transport Director Guan Shiqian to prepare the train and telegraphed 20th Division Commander Sun Tongxuan and 29th Division Commander Cao Fulin to come to Jinan to discuss the province's defense. Sun and Cao arrived on the 18th from their defense stations, and Han held a meeting in the Provincial Government. In addition to the two division commanders Sun and Cao, 22nd Division Commander Gu Liangmin, Handgun Brigade Commander Wu Huawen, Headquarters Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang, and all section chiefs, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Finance Director Wang Xiangrong, Provincial Government Secretary-General He Shaotang, and others attended. Han instructed them to carefully maintain the province's defense. Headquarters affairs were entrusted to Gu Liangmin and Liu Shuxiang for acting on their behalf, and Provincial Government affairs were entrusted to Li Shuchun and Zhang Shaotang for acting on their behalf. If there is an emergency, telegraph at any time for instructions. He also ordered Councilor Zhang Lian, Yao Yijia, Zhang Shouqian, Bureau Chief Niu Zhao, Deputy Director Meng Guangshan, Head of the Reception Department Zhang Xichen, Han Huancen, Section Chief of the Staff Department Jiang Renchun, and Director of the Telegraph Office, etc. to accompany him. Other departments also sent staff for consultation. One radio station and two companies of guards were also taken. At 6:00 PM, the special train was also prepared, with five first-class passenger cars, eight covered cars, six Taishan Team armored cars, one third-class car, and one locomotive at each end, a total of twenty-two carriages. At 7:00 PM, the accompanying guards began to board the train. At 10:00 PM, Han also arrived at the station. At 10:30 PM, Jiang Bocheng arrived. All the party, government, and military leaders all went to the station to see him off. Chairman Ge Guangting of the Jiaoji Railway Committee also went to Baoding to meet Chiang.</p>
<p>Han told reporters at the station about his mission to the north, saying that Chairman Chiang had sent General Counselor Jiang (Bocheng) to Jinan to convey his intention, ordering him to go to Baoding. There was also a telegram today, although he did not specify what was happening, but it was not known to be an instruction on resisting Japan and defending against insults. However, the coastal defense of Shandong is important, and it is probably not possible to order the Shandong team to go north. It was originally intended to go directly from Jinan to Baoding without going to Beiping, but Minister He had a telegram summoning him, so it was decided to go to Beiping first, stay for one day, and then go to Baoding, returning to Jinan in at most six days. I originally intended to go to Beijing this month to meet with Chairman Chiang and Minister He to report on the province's military affairs and ask for instructions on everything. Because of the Yuguan incident, Chairman Chiang ordered me to sit in Jinan, so I could not go. As the Rehe war began and North China became tense, Shandong's defense was also very important. Without orders, I dare not leave without authorization, so I first sent Commissioner Zhang (Yue) to Baoding to ask for instructions. Now that I have been ordered to go, I should leave immediately. I will obey all orders from the central government and Chairman Chiang. At 11:30 PM, he shook hands with the farewell party and boarded the train to go north. (19th)</p>

<p>Continued News on the Tenant's Suicide Case</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dong Qingyu's family in the neighborhood suddenly had a tenant, Wang Heshang, from Qingpu, commit suicide by cutting his throat. For a while, discussions were buzzing with different opinions about the cause of the suicide. After receiving the report, the County Court Prosecutor's Office immediately sent Prosecutor Zhu Zonghai, along with bailiffs and police, to investigate. The investigation confirmed that the knife wound was on the right side of the neck, a vital point, which caused death. The coroner filled out the death certificate and took Dong Qingyu back for investigation, then issued a warrant for his arrest. It is reported that the deceased's wife and children heard the news and came to Songjiang, wailing loudly over the body. After mediation by Dong's family, it is said that Dong's family paid 60 yuan in compensation. The family then claimed the body and hired a boat to take it home for burial. It is said that the compensation was advertised as 60 yuan, but there were other conditions within it. The family of the deceased has already solved the legal problem, but it may not be resolved quickly for a while.</p>

<p>Money Industry Opposes Business Tax</p>
<p>According to the Wu County Money Industry Association's letter to the Wu County Chamber of Commerce, the Business Tax Bureau is forcing them to fill out repeated declarations, which is considered to be an exploitation of merchants, and has presented three reasons: (1) The commerce of Suzhou is declining. Those in power should be trying to rescue it and cannot bear to impose taxes. (2) Suzhou and Shanghai are close neighbors. Shanghai has no tax. The same business is extremely unfair. (3) The Bank of China has no tax. The money industry alone bears a heavy tax. It is inevitable to destroy the money industry. At this time when the abolition of taels and the change of yuan is imminent, there is no way to survive, so they risked speaking out, etc. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce forwarded it to the Suzhou Finance Department on the 20th to ask for instructions.</p>

<p>Carelessness at Salad Oil Factory</p>
<p>Director X of the Tongyuan Rice Shop under the Gongyun Bridge outside the North Gate secretly set up a Ronghu Salad Oil Refinery behind Zhang Alley opposite the Lixin Cloth Factory on Huishang Bridge. The business was developing well. But at about 11:00 AM yesterday (21st), the factory suddenly caught fire. Because of the accumulation of kerosene, it was impossible to extinguish it. Fire brigades from nearby sections rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. It had already burned the salad oil and kerosene tanks. The barrels caught fire and exploded, with lead sheets flying everywhere, making it difficult for the firefighters to rescue. It was not extinguished until about 1:00 PM. In addition to the factory building being burned down, more than ten "shun" of salad oil and more than 100 boxes of kerosene were burned, with a total loss of approximately 3,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Review</p>
<p>Model of Sun Yat-sen's Statue</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony on November 12, Construction Costing a Total of 12,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the model of Sun Yat-sen's statue was sculpted by Mr. Jiang Xiaojian, seven months have passed. After several revisions in between, it was not until yesterday that the representatives of the five standing organs of the Municipal Government completed the review. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e71">Solemn and Grand <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The model is a standing statue, 8 feet high, and 9 feet high including the base. The whole is white. Wearing a mandarin jacket and long gown, the right hand holds a felt hat hanging down to the knee, and the left hand holds a cane. Energetic, solemn, and grand, making people respectfully admire.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Lifelike <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Xiaojian, who made the model, told the reporter of the Shen Shi News Agency that the model started construction in July or August last year. After several revisions in between, it was finally completed today. The model is based on a photo taken in Tianjin before Sun Yat-sen's death, which is better than the average half-body or full-body, so the shape is lifelike.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Attendees <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>

<p>After taking photos in front of the model of Sun Yat-sen's statue, the representatives of each agency continued to hold the ninth standing meeting of the Construction Committee. Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting as usual and resolved (1) most of the models are well-made, but the hem of the long gown is too small and the felt hat is too large, and should be corrected appropriately; (2) Director Sun has already seen the model, but the glabella is slightly low and should be raised, the chest is too high and should be lowered, and the cane should also be slightly improved; (3) The cornerstone has been moved to the city center area, and the groundbreaking ceremony will no longer be held. The opening ceremony will be held as originally planned on November 12; (4) The contract will be transferred by the Municipal Government to the Public Works Bureau to sign with the engineer in charge of construction. The construction cost is said to be 12,000 yuan. 5,000 yuan will be paid upon signing the contract, and another 5,000 yuan will be paid after completion.

<p>Requesting the Appointment of Chiang Kai-shek as Commander-in-Chief</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports: The City Party Headquarters yesterday sent a telegram to the Central Government, addressed to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: "We respectfully submit that while the committee system of military control is not without its merits, it is suitable for peacetime but not for wartime. Moreover, in modern national warfare, not only military power and command must be centralized and unified, but also the national management of food, financial regulation, and other important industries must all be subordinate to military control. Only by concentrating the power of the entire nation under a centralized command can we achieve comprehensive planning and appropriate responses, thereby achieving the remarkable effect of defeating the enemy and achieving victory. Now, as our country faces a powerful enemy pressing upon our borders and difficulties increasing daily, both resisting the enemy and suppressing bandits are of the utmost importance, concerning the survival of the nation and the life and death of the race. If there is no centralized power and unified command, we will inevitably suffer piecemeal defeat by the enemy. The loss of Eastern Liaoning and the fall of Jehol are still painful reminders, and the lessons of the past are not far off. Now that Chairman Chiang is stationed in North China, directing everything, we respectfully request that your Committee promptly deliberate and resolve to grant him the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, so that he may have complete command and make agile use of it. The future of resisting the Japanese and suppressing bandits truly depends on this." Respectfully submitted by the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>

<p>(Titles omitted) "The enemy is attacking the Luowenyu and Shanzhayu areas. Our officers and soldiers waited for the enemy to approach our positions before wielding their swords and striking directly, resulting in countless corpses. We even captured a cavalry captain alive, while the rest fled in panic. At noon, the enemy, with even larger infantry and artillery units, coordinated their forces and attacked Shanzhayu. The enemy bombarded us with dozens of cannons, raining down shells. The enemy took the opportunity to advance on both sides of our positions. Regiment Commander Li Zenzhi personally supervised his troops, bravely fighting back with extreme ferocity. Regiment Commander Li was unfortunately wounded, yet he continued to direct the battle despite his severe injuries. Our Regiment Commander Qiu Zhiyuan led Wang Hechun's battalion to reinforce us, engaging in five hours of bloody hand-to-hand combat, killing five hundred enemies. Battalion Commander Wang Hechun was killed in action. The enemy infantry and cavalry launched a strong assault on Xifengkou, resulting in hours of fierce fighting. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was repelled by us." Respectfully submitted by Song Zheyuan, guarding the frontier with skill.</p>

<p>(Titles omitted) "The enemy facing Luowenyu and Shanzhayukou launched a full-scale attack on our positions last night. Our Division Commander Liu Ruming personally went to the front lines, supervising the Huang unit in a desperate defense. He also dispatched Brigade Commander Li Jintian with a regiment of soldiers to launch a flanking attack on the enemy from the Shabao Yugou Pass. Near Kuaihuo Lin, they were detected by the enemy and came under heavy fire. Our officers and soldiers, disregarding their own safety, drew their swords and charged into the enemy lines, slaughtering countless numbers. At the same time, our Division Commander Liu, seeing the enemy's lines wavering, immediately ordered all units to launch a full-scale attack, attacking from both front and rear. After a night of bloody fighting, we completely cleared the enemy from the areas of Kuaihuoli, Chayukou, Xiaozhengbeiyu, Gushanzi, Shuiquanyu, Madaogou, and Cimeihuayu. Our wounded battalion commanders are Liu Zixiang and Yin Xigan, and other officers and soldiers have suffered heavy casualties. Currently, there are no enemy traces within ten miles north of Luowenyu. (2) According to reliable reports, there are large reinforcements arriving from their rear, seemingly shifting towards our left flank. Division Commander Liu has been instructed to pay special attention and prevent their counterattack. (3) In the Xifengkou area, there were only small-scale conflicts with guerrilla forces last night. This morning, three enemy aircraft dropped over a dozen bombs at Saheqiao and Santunying, wounding several civilians." Specially delivered, Song Zheyuan. Hao Yi.</p>

<p>Supplies for Frontline Soldiers</p>
<p>Li Liejun's circular telegram: "Shanghai, please forward to the Municipal Council, Local Associations, Relief Federation, National Crisis Relief Association, Bankers' Association, Northeast Refugee Relief Association, Northeast Association, Lawyers' Association, Gauze Industry Federation, Money Trade Association, Newspapers, and all organizations: I, Liejun, have been residing in Shanghai for months. Internal and external troubles have reached their peak. I was summoned to Beijing some time ago to discuss major plans. Looking around in bewilderment, I decided to focus on military affairs. I believe that reforming politics is the fundamental task. I proposed, with deep feeling, that because North China is in danger, I should go north for inspection. However, on the way, I heard that Jehol had fallen. I am saddened by the frontline troops, enduring hardships amidst ice and snow, fighting fiercely until now. Casualties are piling up, but supplies of food, ammunition, and medicine are difficult to maintain, leading to unnecessary sacrifices and insufficient strength to eliminate the enemy. This is a critical moment. Destroying one's home to relieve the nation's crisis has historical precedent. If we can unite the wisdom, courage, and resources of the entire nation to face the enemy, morale will be boosted and defeating the enemy will not be difficult. Although the Japanese invaders are fierce, they have provoked public anger. Their ambition to dominate will fail. The organizations in Shanghai have many wise and patriotic individuals. I urge you to exert your utmost efforts to provide continuous supplies, so that soldiers are well-fed and horses are strong, and we can defeat the powerful enemy and restore the nation's prosperity. I humbly submit this request, eagerly awaiting your response." Li Liejun. Xian.</p>

<p>Discusses Policy Towards Japan</p>
<p>To Visit Wang in Nanjing in Three Days</p>
<p>Ambassador Jiang Zuobin, after completing his official business in the north and returning to Nanjing, took the night express train to Shanghai to rest. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Jiang at his residence yesterday and was granted an interview. The following points were discussed:</p>
<h3 id="e87">Consistent Policy Towards Japan <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to Jiang, "My trip to the north was for reporting purposes. Minister Luo was in North China dealing with certain diplomatic issues, making contact with the embassies of various countries in China and explaining that our country has no choice but to engage in resistance. Rumors of direct negotiations are purely speculative fabrications intended to confuse the public. The people of the country should not believe them. Since Japan has repeatedly engaged in violence and aggression, our government's diplomacy towards Japan has consistently followed its established policy, without any possibility of change. This can be seen in Minister Luo's recent statements, and I might as well reiterate it for the benefit of the people."</p>
<h3 id="e88">Only Way Out is Resistance <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>"Regarding the international situation, the United States, Russia, France, Italy, and other countries have all expressed sympathy towards us in this Sino-Japanese issue. However, their positions and circumstances vary, and due to their own interests, they cannot provide actual assistance. Therefore, the only way out for our country is to struggle arduously and actively resist."</p>
<h3 id="e89">Military Preparations are Complete and Thorough <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then asked about the military situation in the north, stating that while our army has repeatedly defeated the enemy and achieved victories, it is unknown if there are any other supply preparations besides the front lines. Jiang replied that in addition to the complete and thorough arrangements in the front-line positions, Chairman Chiang has made ample preparations for subsequent supplies. Moreover, all military commanders throughout the country are determined to resist Japan. Therefore, they will do their utmost to resist and defend against the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Will Meet With Wang Again Within Days <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>"I (Jiang referring to himself) originally planned to report everything to President Wang in Nanjing, but after hearing that President Wang was staying in Shanghai for a few more days, I rushed to Shanghai. However, our paths did not cross. Since returning to the country, I have been constantly traveling and have not had any rest. The journey has been tiring, and I feel quite exhausted. Therefore, I have decided to rest in Shanghai for a few days and then go to Nanjing in three days to meet with President Wang. As for when I will return to my post, I am still unable to decide."</p>

<p>Telegram to the World Christian Council</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang and others, initiators of the Chinese Christian Faith Action National Salvation Ten-Person Group, yesterday sent a telegram in English to the World Christian Council, requesting that it be forwarded to Christian churches in Europe and America. The original text reads: "We, in all sincerity, represent the public opinion of Shanghai Christians in extending our greetings to fellow believers around the world and appealing for prayers for China's national crisis. Japan is attempting to realize its continental policy, disregarding the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and taking advantage of our country's disaster of widespread flooding. It has launched an undeclared war, seizing the Three Eastern Provinces with violence and disturbing Shanghai, and has recently ravaged Jehol, not only endangering our North China but also our country. Our government and people, having reached the limit of their endurance, have risen up in solidarity, vowing to resist the invasion, exhausting their intelligence, and jointly facing the national crisis. All our actions are purely for self-defense and driven by a sincere desire to maintain world peace. Japan's ambition is not only to destroy our country's territorial and administrative integrity but also to use our country's territory as its military base in order to carry out its ambition to conquer the world. Christianity, based on the spirit of Christ's love, rejects violence in its doctrine and advocates justice. Many enlightened Japanese fellow believers deeply hate the evil deeds of the warlords, and their sense of righteousness should not be behind anyone else. The recent resolution passed by the League of Nations Nineteen-Member Committee shows that justice still exists in people's hearts, and the glimmer of world peace has not been completely extinguished. We cannot help but express our sincere gratitude to God. We seek the concerted efforts of fellow believers around the world, under the banner of Christianity, to extinguish the scourge of war, and we pray for your deep sympathy for our actions of self-defense and maintaining world peace. We also hope that those people under the iron heel of the Japanese army, who are displaced and destitute, will receive spiritual assistance."

<p>Dependents Arriving Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>133 Women and Children, Mrs. Wang Accompanying, Representatives Contacting Various Organizations to Arrange Accommodations. General Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, led his troops in resistance for years. Due to exhausted ammunition and lack of reinforcements, they retreated into Russian territory from Dongning. The dependents of the officers of the army, numbering one hundred and eighty-eight people, also followed them into Russian territory. The Central Government then dispatched two steamers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Wu Yang and others, to Vladivostok to transport the dependents of Generals Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Li Du. They have already arrived in Tianjin and are heading to Peiping. Of General Wang's dependents, excluding 19 wounded soldiers who were transported to Peiping for treatment and 11 dependents of Brigade Commander Zheng Xing who went to Peiping, there are still 158 people, including 25 men and 133 women and children, who are coming to Shanghai on the Wu Yang. According to Zhang Chuyu, the Shanghai representative of General Wang, speaking to a reporter from the Nichinichi News, he received a telegram from the representative Liang Detang in Peiping stating that the ship set sail on the 7th, departing from Tanggu and heading south. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai today (the 21st). General Wang's wife is also on the same ship, accompanied by Zhao Shenyuan, Kong Xianzhang, Meng Yushu, and others. Zhang stated that he, along with Li Du's representative Liu Piguang and Ma Zhanshan's representative Wu Huanzhang, contacted the Shanghai Municipal Government and various organizations such as the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association and the Northeast Refugee Relief Association to arrange accommodations. The reporter also inquired with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and a person in charge stated that the Wu Yang had already arrived in Yantai and was heading south. They had received a telegram, but it was unknown whether it would stop in Qingdao. However, it is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow at the latest. Zhang Chuyu's letter to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association requesting assistance reads as follows: "Respectfully, due to the fact that the dependents of our army's Commander-in-Chief Wang and other generals are returning to the country from Vladivostok and departed from Tanggu on the 17th, taking a ship to Shanghai, they are expected to arrive soon. I am instructed by Representative Liang Detang to inform the Liaoning-Jilin Support Association and the Jilin Headquarters, requesting that they inform various organizations to arrange for care. A copy of the original telegram is enclosed for your perusal. I pray for your attention to this matter." Sincerely, the Shanghai Liaison Office of the National Salvation Army Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin. March 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Second Batch <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Antiquities Arriving Today</p>
<p>Totaling 1,564 Boxes</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports: The first batch of 1,054 boxes of antiquities from the Peiping Palace Museum have been transported to Shanghai and stored at the former Renji Hospital at No. 26 Tianzhutang Street. The authorities of the Chinese Settlement and Song Ziwen, acting as the head of the Executive Yuan, have sent personnel to provide strict protection. The museum's Secretary-General Li Zongtong and Secretary Wu Ying have returned to the north. The second batch of antiquities has also left Peiping and arrived in Nanjing and will also be transported to Shanghai for storage. The second batch consists of 1,564 boxes, which is more than the previous batch. However, 70 of these boxes contain antiquities from the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, mostly bronzes, jades, and paintings. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a telegram from Nanjing stating that the Kuailli (Fast Profit) ship carrying the antiquities had set sail for Shanghai in the afternoon. Therefore, it is expected that this batch of antiquities will arrive at the pier by ship this afternoon, berthing at the Jinliyuan Wharf on Xinkai River. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter returned to the storage location to inquire. It was stated that the second batch of antiquities is expected to arrive at the warehouse this afternoon or tomorrow morning. Councilor Chen of the Executive Yuan is responsible for their safekeeping. Yu Tongkui, who escorted the second batch south, is expected to arrive on the same ship tomorrow. When the second batch left Peiping, it was escorted by 150 military police officers sent from Peiping to Nanjing. It is believed that after arriving in Nanjing, they will be transferred to the Capital Military Police for escort to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, Maotai Transportation Company trucks will still be hired, and under the protection of military police, the goods will be unloaded and transported to the warehouse.</p>
<p>Another report states that the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica has shipped more than 30 books with the second batch of antiquities from Peiping. After arriving in Nanjing, they were transferred to a freight train on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway and arrived in Shanghai yesterday for preservation.</p>

<p>Aviation to Save the Nation Movement</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Aviation to Save the Nation campaign in Shanghai, various sectors have enthusiastically risen up, either donating generously themselves or striving to solicit donations from relatives and friends. The number of donors submitting money to the office of the captain of the campaign daily reaches hundreds. Overseas Chinese have also been remitting funds back to the country in droves. The actresses of the capital have also specially organized the Capital Actresses Aviation to Save the Nation Fundraising Conference, deciding to hold three days of rehearsals and donate all ticket sales. All of these are worth recording. Details are provided below:</p>
<h3 id="e95">Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is initiating a fundraising campaign to put aviation to save the nation into practice, launching Shanghai Merchant No. 1 and distributing the fundraising booklets, entrusting the entire executive and supervisory committees to actively raise funds. The details have been reported previously. Now that the executive committee member Chen Yizhou (representative of the foreign tea industry) has first submitted the donation to the Chamber, the Chamber has sent a letter of commendation and also re-notified all executive and supervisory committees to actively raise funds, hoping to see early success. The letters are detailed below: (1) Commending Mr. Chen: "Respectfully, on the 18th of this month, we received your letter stating that you have raised the full amount of 5,000 yuan under your name for the Aviation to Save the Nation donation and have sent a check, requesting a receipt, etc. Each committee member is responsible for collecting these donations, and you are the first to complete the task. This is due to your sincere integrity, which moved others to respond as expected. We deeply admire your planning and consider it a model. In addition to issuing a receipt, which the bearer will forward, we are writing this reply to inform you." Addressed to Mr. Chen Yizhou of the Foreign Tea Industry Association. (2) Letter urging the committee members: "The decision to donate to Aviation to Save the Nation by the business community was made at the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on January 29th of this year. Each committee member is required to raise a minimum of 5,000 yuan and is responsible for collecting the funds. After the funds are collected, the first task is to purchase an aircraft. It was stipulated that the deadline was the end of February. Later, Chen Songyuan requested that donation booklets be printed, and they were distributed accordingly. After this news spread, foreign aircraft companies immediately offered to sell aircraft, but the Chamber declined because the funds had not yet been collected. Recently, only Committee Member Chen Yizhou has submitted the 5,000 yuan that he recognized. Considering the current situation of the foreign tea industry, which has been declining in recent years, it is remarkable that he has been the first to complete the task. Our Chamber is the leader of the business community. If we spend months discussing and collecting funds to purchase aircraft, but the result is only a pie in the sky, how can we face the various sectors and the whole country? Criticism is a common ailment these days. It is often said that there is discussion without a decision, and a decision without action. Our business community should not be involved in this kind of malady, which would lead to the failure of everything due to too much discussion and too little success. We are sending this special letter to urge you to collect the full amount of 5,000 yuan for the Aviation to Save the Nation donation as soon as possible and submit it to the Chamber. This is our earnest hope." Addressed to all members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees.</p>

<p>On the 18th of this month, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau invited 74 representatives from water pipe shops and advertising businesses to a tea party. During the meeting, Section Chief Zhu of the Second Section of the Bureau explained the importance of aviation and invited those present to join as members. The businessmen were moved and automatically signed up to join. Yu Yu-kuan, Luo Ruifu, Wan Yun, and Geng Zhen became supporting members, prepaying membership fees for three or four years. In addition, there were those who joined as group members and special members, all prepaying membership fees. The total amount is nearly a thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Wang Yurong, Li Xiaofeng, Shen Suwen, and other actresses from the capital sent a letter to the office of the Aviation Association, stating: "The national crisis is pressing, and aviation to save the nation is an urgent necessity. Your association has initiated a righteous cause, organized the association, and raised a call to action that has been answered by all sides. We, Yurong and others, perform in Nanjing, singing songs in the Qinhuai River, lingering over the relics of the Six Dynasties and inspiring patriotism. We have specially organized the Capital Actresses Aviation to Save the Nation Fundraising Conference, deciding to hold three days of rehearsals and donate all ticket sales to your association to prepare for the purchase of aircraft. At the same time, all of the actresses of the capital intend to join your association as members, so that we can continue to follow and work hard." This shows their patriotic spirit. It is said that the Aviation Association office has sent a letter of commendation.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Poet Alert <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Dunshou, a famous calligrapher from Pudong, donated 100 yuan under the name of his grandson and wrote a seven-character ancient verse to encourage the people. The verse is recorded below: A great thief enters the room with knives and spears, and the vast territory of the nation is about to sink. All of us compatriots must quickly save ourselves, sending border garrisons and not worrying about a thousand pieces of gold. Accumulating sand to form a pagoda is very pleasing, and even a single grain of an ant’s nest is higher than Cen. Children and coolies happily help, showing that the hatred of the enemy is truly unanimous. But why do wealthy families with millions of dollars tightly close their doors and refuse to give a good word? They rarely give a hair to a righteous cause, not thinking that national destruction will bring calamity. Your wealth was also obtained through exploitation, and you indulge in extravagant singing and dancing. Can your descendants escape the disaster? Instead of accumulating wealth, why not plant trees to provide shade? Do you not know to be alert? It is appropriate to destroy the home to relieve the national crisis now. Do you not see how the wealthy people in the Northeast have been bitterly exploited and robbed, with each person adding knives to the chopping block?</p>

<h3 id="e101">Novel Fundraising Method <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Chuan Hongtao, residing at No. 473 Julai Road in the French Concession, has recently created a new method for fundraising for aircraft. It essentially involves each citizen of the Republic of China donating one copper coin per day, each coin being equivalent to 0.003333 silver yuan. With a population of over 460 trillion people nationwide (excluding the three northeastern provinces), the daily donation of copper coins would amount to over 1.56 million silver yuan. Monthly, this would raise over 47 million yuan, and annually, over 560 million yuan. Considering the price of each aircraft to be 150,000 silver yuan, over 3,733 aircraft could be purchased in a year. The procedure is simple and the effect is significant. However, how to collect and centralize these donations poses a problem. It is said that Mr. Chuan has devised a proper method for this. Those who wish to know the details can contact Mr. Chuan directly.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Japanese Troops Pour into Rehe <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Opportunity to Recover the Northeast Has Arrived</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Plan to Revolt,　　Underground Resistance Begins to Mobilize　　Deng Wen and Li Haiqing in Dolun</p>
<p>Deng Wen, formerly of the Heilongjiang Volunteer Army Command and representative of Li Mingxin of the 2nd Army of Ma Zhanshan, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from the north to contact various organizations and provide aid to the volunteer army to recover the three northeastern provinces. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited him at his residence yesterday morning to discuss the situation of the troops retreating from Rehe and Heilongjiang and the current state of the Northeast. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e110">Deng and Li Retreat to Chahar <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Deng Wen and Li Haiqing's troops, totaling over 20,000 men, retreated to Rehe Province due to a lack of ammunition and supplies in Heilongjiang. They first stationed in Kailu, where they received 100,000 rounds of ammunition and 200 rounds of artillery shells from the Beiping Military Branch and the Liaojihei Support Association, which was insufficient for distribution. The Military Branch promised to replenish anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, and ammunition, but they had not arrived by the time the war began and they were forced to retreat to Linxi. Later, affected by the loss of Chengde, they retreated to Dolun. Exhausted from prolonged fighting and lacking food and supplies, they hoped to receive sufficient replenishment and support so that they could continue to fight the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Three Eastern Provinces are Empty <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese troops currently being transferred to attack Rehe are the same troops that were stationed in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. The main force has already been sent to Rehe, so the Japanese military strength in the three provinces is very weak. Both Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces only have three to five hundred men stationed in the provincial capitals and trading ports. The rest of the defenses are handled by the puppet troops. However, the puppet troops have not forgotten their homeland and have suffered bullying from the Japanese, harboring resentment. They are temporarily enduring and submitting to preserve their strength and await an opportunity to act because the central government has no concrete action to recover the lost territories. Now that the central armies have officially planned to fight the brutal Japanese, the puppet troops all plan to revolt.</p>
<h3 id="e112">A Rare Opportunity <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In August of last year, the Heilongjiang armies received a handwritten letter from Zhang Hanqing, stating that failing to avenge national and personal grievances would make them unworthy of being human. He decided to lead his 20 brigades out of the pass to recover the lost territories. Wang Zhizhe's six brigades went first, opening the gateway to the Northeast. Su Bingwen, 㯷 Bingshan, and others were encouraged by the news and rose up to fight the enemy. As a result, the Japanese army launched an all-out invasion to the north and defeated them one by one because the interior of the country was unable to send troops. Su and Ma retreated to Russian territory, and Deng Wen, Li Haiqing, and others led their troops to Rehe. However, 㯷's troops remained in Heilongjiang Province, lurking in the deep mountains, with a strength of about 20,000 men. But they face difficulties in supplies, and their clothing and shoes are incomplete. Recently, they have begun to mobilize towards the cities. There are many other underground resistance forces. If they receive sufficient support and rise up together, taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese are focusing all their efforts on fighting in Rehe and the three eastern provinces are empty, and if the armies within the pass launch an attack again, it will not be difficult to recover the lost territories in one fell swoop, allowing the people of Liaodong to see the clothing and culture of Han Chinese again.</p>

<p>Sun Dianying, the commander of the 41st Army, sent his representative Zhang Youqun to Shanghai to report to all sectors on the army's arduous fighting in northern Rehe and to seek assistance. It is learned that Representative Zhang has completed his mission in Shanghai and will take the overnight express train to Beijing last night to make contact with the Military Council. According to Representative Zhang, he received a telegram from the Chief of Staff Feng of our army this morning (the 20th) stating that the enemy has been transferring large numbers of fresh troops for reinforcement in recent days, and that intense fighting is expected to occur within the next day or two. He hopes that all parties will provide material assistance to enable him to fight to the end. He will enter Beijing tonight, and whether he will return north or come to Shanghai again will be decided after consulting with Commander Sun.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry yesterday instructed the International Trade Bureau of this city, stating that it had received a report from the Consul General in Manila stating that the Philippine authorities have been working hard to achieve independence from the United States. The U.S. government is deeply understanding of this request, and although the implementation methods have not been decided, it is likely to become a reality in the near future. Since the Philippines came under the control of the United States, trade between the two countries has been free according to regulations.</p>

<p>Statistics in recent years show that they account for about 80% of total exports. The Philippines is an agricultural country, and its main products include sugar, hemp, rice, coconut, tobacco, and timber. Now, it is facing overproduction, sluggish overseas sales, and falling prices. Therefore, developing local products and overseas markets is both essential to addressing the issue of independence and an urgent task. The Philippine government has already begun to make concrete plans for this.</p>

<p>It is paying particular attention. At the end of last year, Philippine Governor Roosevelt sent his counselor, Colonel Cary I. Crockett, to China for investigation in preparation. The council recently decided to send four members to form a delegation to investigate in various parts of our country in preparation for a complete plan. It can be seen that Mr. Crockett's trip last year left a very good impression. The four members are (Marcelo T. Boncan Jnan L. Luna Jose E. Romero Jose A. Ozamis). In addition, there are four specialized committee members (Prof. Vientr G. Sinco Prof. Jose A. Espiritn Rep. Gregorio Nieva Atty. Quintin Paredes Jr.). Before this plan was finalized, member (MaeCrceLo T. Boncan) informally contacted the consulate regarding the Philippines' desire to develop commerce in other countries. As the Consul General, I believe that China and the Philippines are close neighbors,</p>

<p>Number in the tens of thousands, requiring considerable support. In recent years, the authorities have been devising unfavorable measures against foreign merchants and imported goods in order to increase tax revenue and protect local products. One example of this is the increase in import tariffs on eggs and other items implemented last year. The Philippines has a trade surplus with the United States, and its foreign trade, other than with the United States, is mostly imports. Therefore, there is little fear of retaliation from other countries. If the Philippines' commerce with our country improves in the future, these restrictions will naturally be lifted. Therefore, I expressed deep sympathy for the member's contact. At that time, I indicated that we should find a way to eliminate the parts of the tariff increase last year that were biased against Chinese goods in order to show mutual benefit. The member also indicated that there was room for discussion. The delegation is currently preparing everything and tentatively plans to depart on the President Taft on March 29.

<p>Traffic Department Relocation Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, formerly located at the small and cramped Bazilu (靶子路) address, found it inadequate for office space and inconvenient as its various departments were not centrally located. Consequently, a new location was sought, and the second floor of the Riverside Mansion at the intersection of North Suzhou Road and Henan Road was rented as the new headquarters. Last Saturday and Sunday, during the holiday, the administration first moved the General Affairs, Engineering, and Mechanical Departments. Yesterday, Monday, operations commenced at the new location. The Materials and Accounting Departments, however, could not move until the renovations of the new premises are completed, which is expected to be by this Sunday. The old Bazilu headquarters, now vacant, has already been hired for repairs and will be used to relocate the Medical Department as a railway hospital. As for the Traffic Department, due to a temporary suspension of the Northern Station's relocation order, the plan is to slightly renovate the burned-out building for the department's office use, but this is currently still under consideration and no decision has been made.</p>

<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizen Federation held its sixth executive committee meeting yesterday at 8:00 PM. Eleven committee members were present, with Xu Xiuting presiding. After the report, the following issues were discussed: (1) The French Concession Water and Electricity Company has already implemented the recent increase in tram fares. According to reports, the company's business situation, due to its monopoly, is exceptionally developed, with an average annual profit of over one million yuan after expenses. Now, this thriving and highly profitable company has suddenly increased prices, disregarding the burden on the city. It is also rumored that water rates will also be increased. This association should express its opposition. Resolution: (A) Based on the company's business situation, send a letter to the Chinese directors of the French Concession Taxpayers' Association to conduct detailed research and express opposition. (B) Send a letter to the Municipal Federation and all district branches to unanimously advocate opposition. (2) Abolish Taels and Change to Yuan. The French Concession's municipal donations and water and electricity fees are still calculated in taels, which causes many abuses. The fees should be converted to yuan. Resolution: (A) Send a letter to the Municipal Federation to forward to the Public Works Department to implement reforms immediately. (B) Send separate letters to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association and the district branches of the Municipal Federation to unanimously urge the realization of this goal. (C) Notify citizens to comply uniformly. (3) Discuss several cases of members being fined by the police for freight trucks. Adjourned.</p>

On the 16th, they submitted six preliminary conditions to the factory: (1) The Company recognizes the Shanghai Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union and the Nanyang Cigarette Factory Office as having the right to represent all factory workers; (2) No factory employees may be dismissed without reason; (3) Wage increases, a monthly bonus of three yuan, and the bonus work money of 96 days per person for 1932, calculated as an average of eight days per month for twelve months, should be combined and included in wages; (4) The Company shall subsidize the Nanyang Cigarette Factory Office with 500 yuan per month to carry out employee benefit activities; (5) Female cigarette packers and cigarette workers for soft and hard packs must have their wages increased by two cents per 1,000 cigarettes, large packs must have their wages increased by two li per ten packs, canned goods must have their wages increased by one cent per twenty cans, and box gluing must have their wages increased by two cents per 100 boxes; (6) These preliminary conditions for labor and management shall apply until the official conditions for labor and management are signed. However, no response was received. Yesterday morning, all workers automatically started to slow down work. The officials of the union office then sent representatives, Wu Shiyuan, to report to the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union, requesting mediation. Another group of officials, Zhang Desheng, etc., went to the company's office to discuss solutions with the factory. At that time, the office staff, seeing the large number of workers, feared disturbances and closed the gate, refusing entry. This led to a conflict. As a result, Li Zitang, director of the cigarette packing department, and Li Zihui, director of the tobacco drying room, were injured in the assault, and the order was quite chaotic. When the Huishan Police Station received the report, they immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to suppress it. The injured were taken to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, and a representative of the transportation machinery, Zhang Decheng, was taken into custody by the police station. After receiving the report from the labor side, party and government agencies sent Zhang Sheng, director of the People's Movement Section of the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Xianqing, director of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, along with Zhu Xuefan and Bai Shaoxu, members of the General Labor Union, and Zhou Xuexiang, representative of the Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union, to the company's general office at 10:00 AM yesterday to mediate. Assistant Manager Jian Yingfu and legal advisor Wu Linkun received them and called on representatives from the labor side to discuss solutions. After further consultation, the following was decided: (1) The company stated that, in principle, it accepted the six conditions proposed by the labor side and agreed to conduct formal negotiations within one or two days; (2) The company was responsible for finding a way to bail out the detained worker representative; (3) Party, government, and labor union representatives were responsible for persuading the workers who were slowing down to resume work first and wait for a legal solution. It was also decided that at 4:00 PM, negotiations would continue at the company. After the party and government representatives consulted and made a decision, the representatives went to the factory's rooftop platform to summon all the male and female workers, report the results of the consultation, and Wang Xianqing of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Xuefan of the General Labor Union, and Wu Shiyuan, the representative of the labor side, all persuaded the workers in turn. Wu Linkun, the company's representative, also replied. The workers followed the advice of the superiors and resumed work at 2:30 PM, working as usual. The party and government representatives went to the company again at 4:00 PM to continue discussions with the company representative Wu Linkun. Regarding the conditions proposed by the labor side, Mr. Wu stated that the company had already handed over the conditions to labor consultant Zhu Maocheng for detailed study and consideration, so he could not express a definitive statement at the time. An official response would be given on the 22nd (tomorrow) morning. As for the detained worker Zhang Decheng, the police station did not agree to release him, but the company would still find a way to secure his bail.</p>

<p>Slaughtering One's Own Newborn Child</p>
<p>Two children born consecutively died young and infertile.</p>
<p>The Ningbo region has a barbaric custom of killing newborn babies.</p>
<p>It is said that future births will then be ensured of survival.</p>
<p>Chen Along actually resorted to such a heinous act.</p>
<p>Last Saturday night at 9:30 PM, two Chinese detectives, No. 2017 and No. 3041 from the Xinzha Police Station, were patrolling near the Xinzha Road bridgehead. They saw a man, appearing to be in his late twenties, hurrying towards the Suzhou River carrying a bamboo basket. The basket was covered with a large tattered cloth. Suspecting something amiss, the detectives ordered him to stop. Upon removing the cloth for inspection, they discovered a naked infant, covered in blood, inside the basket, who had clearly been stabbed to death. The detectives immediately took the man and the basket containing the corpse back to the police station to report the incident. The police chief then dispatched Detective Tao Rubing to investigate. It was revealed that the man carrying the basket was named Wang Jinyan, a native of Shaoxing, residing at No. 2 Xinzha Road. The baby was born to the wife of Chen Along, a Ningbo native who works as a laborer at the water company and resides at No. 465 Xinzha Road, only five days prior, and had been personally murdered by Chen. Chen Along was 36 years old and had no children. He had been married for nine years. His first son lived to the age of six before succumbing to illness. Later, a daughter was born, but she also died young at the age of only three. Chen's elderly mother, distressed by this, told him of a barbaric custom in Ningbo. She said that if a child is born and does not thrive, the newborn should be killed to ensure future children are healthy. Chen believed this. This time, his wife became pregnant, and on the 13th of this month, she gave birth for the third time. The baby was a boy and cried loudly. The whole family was overjoyed. Unexpectedly, three days later, the baby suddenly fell ill and grew increasingly weaker. By the night of the 18th, he was barely breathing and beyond saving. Chen recalled his mother's words and believed that if he did not sacrifice this child, he would never have healthy children. A murderous intent arose within him. He grabbed a sharp kitchen knife and waited in a secluded alley outside the back door of his house. He asked his friend, Wang Jinyan, to bring the sick baby out of the house. Chen cruelly raised the knife and slashed at the baby's head. With one blow, blood splattered everywhere, and the baby's life was extinguished. This inhuman act, born of superstition, is utterly cruel. Chen then found a bamboo basket, placed the baby's corpse inside, covered it with a bed sheet to conceal it, and asked Wang to carry it to the Suzhou River to throw it into the murky water and let it be food for the fish. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by the patrolmen. The baby's body was sent to the forensic examination office on Avenue Petain. Yesterday morning, a report was submitted to the First Special District Court, and Prosecutor Guo Wei was commissioned to examine the body. The examination confirmed that the baby had died from a head wound. The corpse was handed over to the Pushan Public Cemetery for burial. The two suspects, Chen Along and Wang Jinyan, were brought to the First Special District Court this morning. Judge Qian Wenji conducted a preliminary hearing. First, the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the circumstances of the case, stating that the defendants' actions constituted the crime of murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Law and should be prosecuted accordingly. Judge Qian then briefly questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>The Origin of the Discovery of a Minor Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Jiang Adong, the six-year-old son of Jiang Desheng, who lived in Jianye Lane, Rue Foch, in the French Concession, was kidnapped on February 13th for ransom. The French Police Special Operations Unit detectives apprehended six suspects including the kidnapper Zhou Liansheng and rescued the victim. The criminals were handed over to the Second Special District Court for trial. There were omissions in previous reports, and this is a special supplement. According to the victims, eight ransom letters were received from the kidnappers, signed by Wang Jinzhang and bearing a seal. The important phrases in the letters were also sealed. The letters referred to the "Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Volunteer United Army" or "Commander of this Army," claiming that the military situation in the Northeast was urgent, and the soldiers were in dire need of funds. The letters demanded 15,000 yuan for military expenses, promising to repay the principal and interest after the matter was completed. They instructed the victim not to report to the police, threatening to kill the entire family if the police were involved. In the third letter, there was a pair of cut red papers, with the character "Fu" written on top and the word "contract" spelled out below. The left half of the small square was to be used by the victim as a token of representation. When contacting the bandits, it was used for verification. They also instructed the representative to hold a knife of grass paper and two bottles of medicinal wine as a sign. In one letter, the kidnappers did not affix stamps and instead used two 2-cent revenue stamps, causing the victim to be fined by the post office for insufficient postage. After receiving the letters, the victim sent his neighbor Chen Abing as a representative to negotiate at the front doors of the Old Oriental Hotel and the Wu Palace Hotel, and along the section of Xizang Road from the Far East Hotel north to Yikouxiang. However, the bandits' exorbitant demands led to no result. The final meeting was arranged at the Huayang Hotel, but the secret was leaked, and the French police learned of it, leading to the arrest of the kidnappers. The victim has now submitted the eight letters to the police for submission to the court as evidence. In the meantime, the police have ordered all detectives to strictly apprehend the fleeing leaders of the gang and bring them to justice for trial.</p>

<p>Hosts Guangfu Eye Hospital</p>
<p>Provides Free Diagnosis and Medicine to the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>Dr. Xia Jintang, an ophthalmologist who studied in Japan, originally collaborated with Shibata Hospital. After the September 18th Incident, he broke away. When the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, he spied on the enemy's military situation on behalf of our military headquarters. After the incident, the Japanese army raided his home, and his telegrams and codebooks were searched. Xia himself and his entire family were arrested and taken to the Japanese army headquarters. His entire family was released by Japanese neighbors, but Xia himself was still detained at the Japanese army headquarters in the Japanese primary school. He twice narrowly escaped being shot and witnessed Xiang Songmao being shot by the Japanese army on the morning of February 4th at 3 or 4 AM. According to what Dr. Xia personally learned during his detention, no less than one or two thousand Chinese were shot in the Japanese primary school. Subsequently, our Navy Department negotiated with the Japanese side, and Xia was able to regain his freedom after nine deaths and one life. He is now independently operating Guangfu Eye Hospital at No. 5, Lane 63, east of the racecourse. The name Guangfu means resisting Japan. Dr. Xia is an expert in ophthalmology with excellent medical skills. Now, after his painful experience, he runs a hospital and provides free diagnosis and medicine to the poor and sick to help the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Arrest of the Culprit in the Murder of the Watchman <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Wang Amai, a watchman from Ningbo, 44, at the Wang Maoshun Construction Factory on Hart Road, had been working there for a long time. On January 7th of this year, at 9:15 PM, four thugs, each carrying weapons and lime, broke into the factory. They first tore down the bamboo fence and went straight into Wang's bedroom. They threw lime in Wang's face, then used iron rods and axes to hack at him. Wang, blinded, could not resist and was seriously injured. The attackers fled when they saw their purpose was achieved. Wang's colleague Feng Afu heard the alarm and rushed over, but the attackers were gone. Wang Amai was lying on the bed covered in blood. He reported to the accounting office, who reported to the Xinzha Police Station, ordering detectives to go. Wang was taken to Shilong Hospital but died of his injuries at 12:30 AM. The prosecutor of the First Special District Court examined the body and ordered the police to arrest the perpetrators. Since the case occurred, the police sent Detective Zhao Fuhai Yang Peizhang to investigate, and they finally discovered the cause of the matter. There was a scoundrel from Tianjin named Liu Yuan, nicknamed Tianjin Lao Liu, who was previously a police officer in the Public Security Bureau. Since being dismissed the year before, he had been idle and specialized in forming gangs, stealing wood from construction sites in the western part of Shanghai. In December of last year, Liu was caught stealing wood from Wang Maoshun's factory by Wang Amai, who beat him up and released him. Liu held a grudge and repeatedly thought of revenge. On January 4th, he gathered his gang to discuss and decided to first blind Wang with lime, then use weapons to kill him. On the evening of the 7th, Wang was indeed killed. But Liu had an addiction to opium. Detectives Zhao et al. focused on this and secretly investigated in various opium dens in western Shanghai. Until yesterday, they arrested a suspect named Yue Jiancai from Anhui on Rubenson Road and brought him to the police station. According to Yue, the matter was initiated by Tianjin Lao Liu, who told Yue, Henan Lao Liu, Xiaomanzi, and others to do it together. They then arrested Liu Yuan (Tianjin Lao Liu) and Liu Zhifa separately on the same road. This morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang detailed the above situation, saying that the police are prosecuting Yue Jiancai and Liu Yuan for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. However, the investigation procedures for Liu Zhifa have not been completed, so he is requested to be detained, and the case should be postponed. Then, witness Feng Afu testified that he was a watchman at Wang Maoshun Construction Factory and a colleague of the deceased. On the evening of January 7th, he suddenly heard Wang's cries for help in his room. He rushed to investigate. It was night, and Wang's room was dark. He brought fire and saw Wang covered in blood, saying that he had been attacked by thugs. He was shocked and reported to the accounting office, who sent Wang to the hospital, but he died shortly after. He did not see the perpetrators. Witnesses Zhou Xiande and Liu Xiqing also testified. When questioned, the defendant Yue Jiancai confessed that Tianjin Lao Liu, Henan Lao Liu, and Xiaomanzi, who is still at large, went with him, and he carried an iron rod. When questioned, Tianjin Lao Liu confessed that he used to be a police officer and was dismissed in May of the year before. He then lived as a peddler and smoked opium, and sometimes stole hats to sell for addiction. However, he vehemently denied the murder of Wang Amai. Liu Zhifa is Henan Lao Liu. Judge Qian Wenji verified the confession and ordered the three defendants to be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Smuggler Remanded to Await Sentencing <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Detective Wang Guangqi and Hu Guangrong of the Hongkou Police Station apprehended smuggler Lin Pengju, a native of Fujian, and a woman, Lin Yuying (his sister), on the Zhoushan Maru ship at the Wayside Wharf. They seized two children, one five years old and one two years old, and brought them to the police station. They were sent to the First Special District Court. According to the suspects, they spent 200 yuan to buy the two children from poor families in Chongming and Qidong counties through a certain Jia, who is at large, to take them back to their hometown as sons. However, the contract was lost in a hurry. Police investigation revealed that the siblings planned to take the two children to Fujian to sell them to wealthy, childless individuals, and then use the remaining money to buy more children and split the profits with Jia. They were ordered to be remanded in custody for further investigation. The two children were sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan and Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuze of the Criminal Court Three continued the trial. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that during the postponement, the police sent letters to the Chongming and Qidong County Courts to investigate whether poor families sold their children and whether any children were kidnapped within their jurisdiction. They have already received a reply, stating that no such cases have occurred recently. It is possible that the two children were kidnapped from elsewhere, making it difficult to investigate. When questioned, both defendants spoke in their local dialect, with Chinese Police Chief Shi En acting as interpreter. They insisted that they had no children and spent money to buy adopted children, not to sell them. Their answers were evasive, and they asked for leniency from the court. Judge Wu ordered them to be remanded in custody separately and scheduled a sentencing date.</p>

<p>Li Suqin, a 17-year-old female performer from Nanjing, lives at No. 6, Sanyili, Rue Cardinal Foch, in the French Concession. She has been performing as a Hua Dan actress at the Minle Theater on Rue du Pere Froc for a monthly salary of 100 yuan and is quite popular with the audience. Her elderly father, Li Junqing, and her cousin, Li Zhongxiang, accompany her every day. However, yesterday (17th) at around 8:00 PM, after dinner, Suqin was accompanied by her father and cousin to the theater as usual. When they reached the intersection of Caishi Road, two unidentified men harassed them. Then, emboldened by lust, one of them stopped Suqin, embraced her, and forcibly tried to kiss her. Li's father and cousin were shocked and tried to stop them. The men became enraged and struck Li Zhong twice. They then ordered nearby thugs to take out iron rods and beat Li Zhong, causing him to be injured and fall to the ground. Patrolmen arrived and arrested one of the men, while the others fled. The arrested man was taken to the police station. After questioning, he gave his name as Zhang Fuchun, 45, from Tianjin, and admitted to the assault. He was ordered to be detained. Meanwhile, the injured man was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, Zhang was sent to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer explained the case, stating that the injured person was still recovering in the hospital and could not attend court. He requested a postponement. Zhang's answers were evasive. Judge Zhang Chaozuo ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and approved the postponement of the trial.</p>

<p>Yang Asi, 28 years old, from Yancheng, worked as a rickshaw puller. His wife, Bai, worked as a factory worker in a cotton mill. They lived together at No. 387 Qiwupu Road, Yangshupu. The couple lived a simple life and were considered to be harmonious. They had a child together. Recently, Yang learned that his wife was having an affair. He tried to persuade her to stop, but she refused to admit it, leading to arguments. Yesterday, while she was at work, Yang became resentful and despondent. He felt that life was meaningless and wanted to end his life. He went out and bought opium, which he secretly took. At around 9:00 PM, Bai returned home from work and found her husband lying on the bed, moaning. She asked him what was wrong, but he did not answer. She sent him to Hudong Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. The corpse was taken to the forensic examination office on Avenue Petain. Yesterday morning, a report was submitted to the First Special District Court, and Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, court clerk, and others, went to the office to examine the body. According to Yang Bai, 23 years old, she had claimed that when she returned home last night, she saw him lying on the bed, appearing ill.

<h3 id="e165">The Reading Problem of Impoverished Youth <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Inquiry from Mr. Long Weiyang, Yichang</p>
<p>Having received your reply, I am deeply grateful for your guidance. However, you stated that the current schools are established for the wealthy, and what they teach is also in support of the wealthy. Since you have no money, there is no need to attend these schools. Yes, it is true that without money, how can one attend school? However, in today's China, the number of people without money probably accounts for eight or nine out of ten of the country's population. If one cannot attend school without money, then will the general impoverished youth not all end up without the opportunity to read? What I want to ask you now is: Can we break the boundaries of money and find an opportunity for those without money to have access to books? As for striving and working hard, of course, there is no such thing as not succeeding. However, without the means to become wealthy, no matter how hard you strive or how much you work, you will not find a way, and it will be of no help. Oh, esteemed Mr. Mentor of the People, please give me some guidance!</p>
<p>Answer: Under the current social system and political situation in China, impoverished youth naturally do not have the opportunity to formally enter schools to study. However, this does not mean that our youth cannot read or have the opportunity to read. In Yichang, we do not know the situation; we are in Shanghai, so let us take Shanghai as an example. In Shanghai, there are now many places where ordinary young shop assistants and out-of-school youth can have the opportunity to read. Because public libraries are gradually being established, for example, our circulating library has an average of 300 people reading books every day. In addition, libraries in chambers of commerce and other places are probably the same. Extending from this, the number of people will increase in the future. In this way, are we not invisibly creating many self-study opportunities in society? Moreover, we have specially set up a Reader Advisory column for readers to ask questions, which we feel is creating an opportunity for impoverished youth to have access to books, and the effect will be even greater than formal schools. This is what we dare to predict. If all provinces and regions follow suit, it is not impossible. You can work hard in Yichang to promote these undertakings. As the saying goes, "If you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to succeed, help others succeed."</p>

<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The educational circles of Jiangxi province, recognizing the importance of bandit suppression work, and in order to concentrate the power of the education sector and assist in bandit suppression, have organized the Provincial Education Circles Assistance to Bandit Suppression Committee. The committee has decided on methods for the education sector to assist in bandit suppression, dividing them into two types: material assistance and spiritual assistance. In terms of material assistance, it was resolved to donate funds for bandit suppression during the bandit suppression period, including: (1) Teachers and staff of provincial secondary schools and above and educational institutions will donate 20% of their salaries uniformly.

Each student is required to prepare one bag, with a cost limit of one dime. Within a few days, more than 14,000 bags have been collected and sent to the front by the Department of Education to be distributed to the bandit suppression soldiers.

<p>Result 41 to 29</p>
<p>Nanyang Commercial School and Shanghai College are the two strongest teams in middle school. This battle has a great relationship with the championship. About 50 or 60 Nanyang Commercial School students came to cheer, and the interest was very strong. At the beginning of the battle, Nanyang Commercial School often had the upper hand. Chen Weimin showed his skills greatly, chasing up to 12 points each. Shanghai College's momentum therefore suddenly rose, defeating Nanyang Commercial School by 16 to 12 in the first half. In the afternoon, Nanyang Commercial School took the offensive, and the three forwards Chen Zhou and Wu were fierce and good at fighting, leaving Shanghai College at a loss. After each scored 26, Nanyang Commercial School went straight up, and their momentum was unmatched. As a result, they defeated Shanghai College by 41 to 29. The battle was full of wonderful performances, each showing their strengths, a masterpiece of the long-standing middle school basketball tournament. Nanyang Commercial School had been subjugated to Shanghai College for five years, and they avenged the humiliation of five years of subjugation in yesterday's battle. No wonder the students of Nanyang Commercial School were overjoyed. Referee: Lu Xiangqian.</p>

<p>Colonel Kachiulufski, who once served in the Russian Imperial Army, has recently traveled around and has set foot all over the world. He has just come from Canada and the United States, where he taught sword dancing in Vancouver, Los Angeles, Hollywood, Honolulu, and other places. Since Mr. Kachiulufski came to Shanghai, some students at St. John's University in Fanwangdu have requested the opening of a sword dancing training class and asked him to serve as the professor, which is the first time that Chinese people have learned this kind of European entertainment. It is expected that other schools will also follow suit. Students at the McTyeire School for Girls are also very interested in this. Although there are currently no special</p>

<h3 id="e214">### Movie Propaganda <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Movie propaganda that encourages the spirit of the people and promotes national glory is more genuine and profound than any other kind of propaganda. Since the September 18th Incident, the film industry in our country has made considerable contributions to anti-Japanese war photography; however, it cannot compare with the strong and great influence of films with themes of love, romance, fantasy, and chivalry.</p>
<p>While the Japanese militarists created the history of aggression since the September 18th Incident, they used all their strength to promote war films that encouraged the people. In particular, the "Three Human Bullets" they touted were three soldiers under the command of Company Commander Kawano Junji during the January 28th Battle of Miaohang: 1. Ekaishita, 2. Kitagawa Jo, 3. Sakae I之助, who all sacrificed themselves by carrying bombs and charging into our army's positions. They believed that having these "Three Human Bullets" was a glorious event in their war history. The number of films produced by various film companies about these "Three Human Bullets" was: Shinto Company, 41 films; Gansai Company, 28 films; Fukui Company, 26 films; Akazawa Company, 22 films; Kawai Company, 20 films; Dainichi Company, 11 films; Yoshikawa Company, 7 films; Shochiku Kamata Company, 6 films, totaling 161 films. This shows their fervent admiration for the "Three Human Bullets."</p>
<p>Recently, General Song's victory at Xifengkou was also a glorious page in our war history. The number of warriors willing to act as human bullets far surpassed their mere "Three Human Bullets." After 500 members of the Broadsword Brigade hacked to death over a thousand Japanese soldiers defending the city, only 20-odd survived. Such heroic sacrifices are worth all the people in China's film industry making films about all 400-plus martyrs. They made over a hundred films about their "Three Human Bullets"; we have 400-plus human bullets, so even making thousands of films would not be too many. In order to encourage the people and promote national glory, we must devote ourselves to movie propaganda as much as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enemy will commend the names of the "Three Human Bullets"; will we just let the 400-plus human bullets be nameless heroes? I believe it is necessary to commend the names of all the national heroes who made heroic sacrifices.</p>
<h3 id="e215">### Records of Flowers in Suzhou <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Plum blossoms bloom first in spring and are worthy of appreciation for their unique fragrance. The Fragrant Snow Sea of ​​Dengwei is particularly famous. Everywhere, high and low, there are calyxes and green flowers. Shi Deyuan's poem says: "Halfway up the mountain, human smoke is in the fragrant snow, and chickens and dogs are in the white clouds below." This shows how beautiful the environment is. However, in recent years, mountain people have found planting plum trees to be less profitable, so they have planted mulberry trees instead, interspersed with magnolias. When the flowers bloom in spring, tourists come from all directions to buy boats and wear wax clogs, but they inevitably feel a sense of prosperity and decline compared to the past. The plum blossoms at Piyun Nunnery at the foot of Lingyan Mountain and Lengxiang Pavilion in Tiger Hill are all beautiful, with the charm of rain bathing the fat and rouge, and smoke covering the jade. The botanical garden in the city is now a nursery, and it is also a place to view plum blossoms. The iron-bone red plum blossoms in Keyuan, with branches and leaves of ocher color, are particularly unique.</p>
<p>Peide Hall is located in Bailianjing. The peonies are very lush and are known as the "Fragrant Kingdom of Flowers." Ladies and gentlemen travel there in an endless stream. After Grain Rain, they are all pruned. Therefore, there is a saying that peonies are pruned three days after Grain Rain.</p>
<p>The Master of the Nets Garden in Kuojiatou Lane is privately owned. Its Dianchun 　 is where 　peonies and herbs are planted.</p>
<p>Huanxiu Villa is located in front of Shen Yamen. The last blossoms bloom, monopolizing the elegance.</p>
<p>Panchi Mountain, commonly known as Nanshan, is located southwest of Danshan. There are many peach trees on the shady side of the mountain. In spring, it looks like a brocade curtain.</p>
<p>The Eight Banners Guild Hall has wisteria planted by Wen Zhengming. It twists and turns like a dragon, occupying several acres of land. When it blooms, it is colorful and dazzling, like hanging jewels. Looking at it always makes people miss the elegant virtue and pure style of Mr. Hengshan.</p>
<p>The Qingyang Causeway is lined with cherry blossoms, all white like snow. It is the location of the Japanese Consulate. Since the Japanese pirates invaded and feelings have worsened, no one goes there to enjoy the flowers anymore.</p>
<p>The lotus flowers in Huangtiandang outside Fengmen are lush and green, stretching for several miles. The flowers stand out proudly from the leaves, like Xiangfei emerging from the water. Tourists often hire boats before dawn. The dewdrops are still running on the plates, not yet dry. Suiyuan in the city has twin lotuses. The Qixiang Guild Hall in Wen Yali, east of Baolin Temple, has many lotuses in its pond, which come from the Seven Ze of Xiaoxiang. The exotic species are precious.</p>
<p>The Conggui Villa of Huiyin Garden is surrounded by osmanthus trees, all of which are three or four fathoms high. The millet-jade sticks to the branches, as if storing ten thousand loads of fragrance.</p>
<p>The Xiangzhou of Zhuozheng Garden has poems about camellias by Wu Meicun engraved on its screen. Only the precious pearl flower with thousands of layers clustered together is a pity that it has withered. It is said that there are plans to replant it. If so, then under the bamboo and beside the plum trees, delicate figures will play in the shadows, and the cold season will not be lonely.</p>
<h3 id="e216">### Big Belly <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Xin</p>
<p>There is a Chinese proverb that says: "A prime minister can moor a boat in his belly." A good (boat-mooring) belly is a very big one. But this is not the case. The proverb simply means that the prime minister has a big capacity.</p>
<p>Recently, while reading Mr. Wu Yifeng's "Deng Chuang Cong Lu," there was a passage that said: "An Lushan's belly hung down past his knees and weighed 352 catties. See Yao Runeng's 'An Lushan's Deeds' and Qian Xiyi's 'Southern New Book.'"</p>
<p>This (weighing 350 catties) is probably not the weight of the (belly). There will never be such a heavy (belly) in the world. But this (belly) that can (hang down past the knees) can also be said to be a very big belly.</p>
<h3 id="e217">### Fire <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ningyi</p>
<p>Humans have these two (eight) eyes, so (fire) came into being.</p>
<p>Because A Mao had two eyes, he saw his wife in love with someone else, so he was filled with anger and went to catch the adulterer. A Gou took a fancy to someone else's young lady, so he did something like rape. The other party got angry and sued in court. These are all initiatives of fire (meaning anger), and they added a lot of news to the newspaper out of thin air.</p>
<p>But before the fire, there was a disaster! At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Wu Sangui, in a fit of anger, planted a seed for the Manchu puppet state that exists now, more than 200 years later. Wu Sangui borrowed Qing troops for Chen Yuanyuan, and the Manchus took this opportunity to enter the Central Plains and passed it down to Puyi. The Republic of China was established and the empire was overthrown. This Emperor Xuantong lived in seclusion in Beiping. Who knew that now the dwarves wanted to expand their territory, so they picked Puyi, this treasure, to be a puppet ruler, resulting in the so-called Manchuria. Just imagine Wu Sangui's anger at that time actually affected China 200 years later!</p>
<p>However, fire is ultimately great. Burning Yibi is still a beautiful story to this day, and it also aroused Mr. Dongpo's interest in a night tour of Yibi in the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>However, people are always extremely terrified of it, but they dare not stay away from it. Even the biggest figures have to go hungry if they don't have it. But if you get too close to it, it will immediately burn up all your property and turn it into a flat ground!</p>
<p>Here, I think of this fire (anger) that is burning fiercely in the Three Islands recently. The general public, for the sake of the unfounded Wanbaoshan case, were filled with anger and invaded our Northeast, established a puppet state, and further occupied Rehe. But looking back at our country; it is truly worthy of being a cultural ancient country of thousands of years. It is ridiculous that the young deputy commander has no fire at all? No matter how barbaric the Japanese are, they can't ignite his fire! As for the dying old undead Tang Yulin, there is no need to mention it. Originally, cooked soup without fire would not be able to maintain and become cold soup, right? If fire had a soul, it would only sigh at these two.</p>
<h3 id="e218">### The North Station of the Future <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the North Station has been burned down by Japanese aircraft bombing. After the end of the war, the Ministry of Railways wanted to build a joint transportation station in Zhenru, and planned to sell the land of the current North Station to fund the construction of the new station. The scale of the joint transportation station would naturally be exceptionally magnificent and grand, taking approximately two years. And because the joint transportation station could not meet the urgent need, a temporary station was specially built on Song Park Road to serve as an application. The plan was decided, the foundation of the temporary station was being laid, the land in Pengpu Township was also demarcated, and everything was being prepared.</p>
<p>Now, because the war in the north is very serious, the Ministry of Railways has decided to temporarily postpone the original proposal to move the station. The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, based on the Ministry's order, is now starting to restore the old station. This plan is to rebuild the destroyed building. The design is as follows: the entire building is divided into two floors, the lower floor is the same size as the original site, and the upper floor occupies approximately one-half. There is also a mezzanine in the two floors, which is not visible from the outside.</p>
<p>This building is entirely allocated to the Traffic Department for use, and the remaining departments have all moved to the Riverside Building at the intersection of North Henan Road. The Traffic Department's arrangement is to set up the Commercial Documents Section on the ground floor and mezzanine, and the Dispatching Section and Reading Room on the second floor. After the new station is built, there will also be bars, public telephone booths, and commercial counters on the ground floor, all adopting commercialization to correct the bad habits of the past bureaucratic style.</p>
<p>The new station can be completed in about three months. From then on, the destroyed old site will be covered with a beautiful and magnificent building again.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Zhao Weng said again: "It's not that I'm saying something presumptuous, but the demise of the Great Qing Dynasty was due to this point. The officials of the Qing Dynasty ate and drank, and didn't care about anything like enriching the country and strengthening the army, or planning for the people. They just talked about empty slogans. If two acquaintances greeted each other on the street, they would ask about each other, from big to small, and it would take at least three or four minutes to ask about everything. One person asked a greeting, and the other person would answer with a greeting as usual. Even if you didn't ask, you knew that's how they would answer. Isn't this a bunch of nonsense? Why bother? So I feel that in this day and age, it doesn't matter if young people's manners are a little sloppy, as long as they are busy doing things all day long like you two, then they are the number one good people. Big girl, don't be so reserved, eat!" Saying that, he grabbed a handful of melon seeds and stuffed them into Guizhi's hand. Old Wang had already come in and poured tea again. Guizhi pinched the melon seeds, squatted slightly and thanked him. Zhao Weng repeatedly shook his head and said: "I've said it before, we don't need to be polite." Guizhi smiled and said: "Although that's what you say, I can't be so informal to my elders." Zhao Weng said to Jiang Shi: "What did I say? This girl of yours is reasonable, and can be both rough and refined. My Ziqiang is considered a good kid, and doesn't have any of the habits of a soldier. He earns enough money to support me. But he has official duties, and father and son can't always be together. Although he is now stationed in Xiyuan, as long as the superiors give an order, saying 'let's go,' maybe he'll be transferred today. How can I, as a father, follow him? So I manage the accounts for others in the shop, and I don't want to come back. It's not for anything else. In other people's shops, there are shopkeepers and partners who are always together, so I just muddle along like this and it's not lonely at all. If I didn't do it, what's the point of an old man living at home? Now, I reluctantly let the child pick me up, and just live with such a servant. If I had a girl like your big girl by my side, I would be much happier." Jiang Shi smiled and said: "We only moved in two days ago, and the old master has said these words several times. Otherwise, let's aim a little high and have this child kowtow to you and become your goddaughter."</p>

<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>Di came to my house to see me, and I arranged with her to spend a clear and sunny Sunday afternoon in the Liwa Chestnut Village in Western Shanghai.</p>
<p>When the car finally flew over the Zhongshan Road Bridge and sent us to the pier of Liwa Chestnut Village, the bustling city had already left us far behind! We waved at the pier; the old woman on the opposite side shook the boat over to ferry us to the other shore.</p>
<p>We walked through the lane, and a clear river appeared in front of us. On the other side of the river was a green lawn, and yellow thatched huts were planted in the corners of the field. A few children in red clothes looked like fruits in the field from a distance. We walked along the river and sat down on a stone step by the river.</p>
<p>"Listen! The sound of birds in the branches, the barking of dogs outside the village, our eardrums haven't been in contact with these natural sounds for a long time!" My mind seems to be liberated, I said to Di like this.</p>
<p>"Look! The clear stream in front of us, why can't it wash away the accumulated dirt in our hearts?" Di stared intently at the leisurely flowing water. The sun shone on the smooth water surface, reflecting a dazzling golden yellow.</p>
<p>A warm and soft breeze blew over us, and I sang softly: "Wind: Be careful when you blow, don't blow the flowers down..." I looked at Di's hair again, which had already been messed up by Aunt Feng, so I told her a story about "wind blowing scattered hair."</p>
<p>"The sound of oars, the fate of mountains and rivers!" Although this place lacks verdant mountains, the green water is enough for us to be intoxicated. Our boat has been paddling forward, and the riverside grass seems to be proudly saying to the duckweed in the water: "I am not like you, when I see a boat coming, I have to make way."</p>
<p>When we were tired of traveling and went back, the village was playing farewell music, and the setting sun showed the report for the evening. Finally, Di played on the swing at the head of the village for the last time, which ended a pleasant spring outing of half a day.</p>

<p>— Xizong</p>
<p>The season is telling us that it is already spring. ? Spring is in the countryside, and it wants to give people intoxication and temptation. So I packed up my selling body, dragged my tired body, and after a day's journey, the succession of trains and ships, I finally arrived in my hometown, ran into the countryside, and went to ask about spring.</p>
<p>A group of us partners set off to Daocheng Mountain, passing by the tomb of Chen Yingshi along the way to make a moment's mourning. There were no incense candles and paper ingots, no wine, rice and flower circles; only a goose-yellow tender willow with budding branches in my hand, and a passion burning in my chest. I paid my silent respects.</p>
<p>We walked many uneven stone roads, and under the guidance of our partners, we ran into a farmer's house and stayed for a moment. In the middle of this farmer's house, five photos were hung in the center: Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Dai Ji, Zhang Zhizhong, and Chen Mingshu, heroes of our nation, have deeply penetrated the people. Undoubtedly, it has gained the respect of the public.</p>
<p>When the corner of the red wall was exposed in the mountainside, we knew we were almost there; but because of the earth's gravity, we couldn't get there for a long time. Isn't that what's in front of us? The four characters of the Fuhu Zen Temple have been spread out in front of us. Running to the mountain gate, the first thing we saw was Master Fuhu. According to legend, there was a fierce tiger here that was conquered by him, so a temple was built for him. That's the history of this place. We ran to the top of the mountain again, standing under the tower: looking at the small Huzhou, and the winding highway. And this intoxicating spring breeze has tempted my entire soul. Although we came to ask about spring, except for a few spring breezes, everything was still in the embrace of winter.</p>
<p>When we ran out of the mountain gate, the herdsboy had already ridden on the back of the cow, and bursts of bell sounds came from the temple. Monk, do you know? (Being a monk for a day and ringing the bell for a day is still an empty game.)</p>

<p>— Yu Kuifu</p>
<p>China's national affairs, such as politics, military affairs, finance, and diplomacy, are never on track and run wild like mustangs. Only one thing, articles, is always regular and orderly, and has been the same for thousands of years. Xie An of the Jin Dynasty commented on Zhang Hua's articles, saying: "Even if Duke Zhang wrote thousands of articles, they would still be the same." This sentence can still be applied now. Novels with triangular or pentagonal love affairs need not be mentioned. Even military telegrams always begin with "Heavenly disasters and civil wars have risen in China," in the middle they always use "If Qingfu is not killed, the disaster in Lu will not end" to denounce, at the end they always use "I will not offend others unless I am offended" as an oath, and finally they always use "Old comrades-in-arms, talented people in the sea" as witnesses. And the changes in wording are especially minimal. However, the articles on social events in the newspapers are such that there are these articles every day, in every issue, but the authors never get tired of them, and the readers don't seem to find them annoying. Let me first copy a formula: "So-and-so from so-and-so place, in the prime of her youth, a modest maiden 丨or approaching puberty, graceful or still charming in her old age丨, and Mr. So-and-so, fell in love at first sight, and formed an inextricable bond, starting with secret rendezvous, followed by open courtship 丨or one night stand丨, and then she became pregnant, with a big belly, recently they are as affectionate as a couple, living together as if husband and wife."</p>
<p>These few sentences cannot be missing from any social news report, as if they are chicken soup or MSG in a dish. As for the plagiarism of predecessors in poetry and the verbatim copying in essays, it can be forgiven if it is skillfully prepared. But in a social news report of only a few hundred words, this set of elaborate drumming is always repeated. I really don't understand the psychology that makes both the author and the reader feel interested.</p>
<h3 id="e223">### One Aspect of Saving the Country Through Aviation <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Tianyi</p>
<p>As long as you are a Chinese, you naturally know the importance of aviation. Saving the country through aviation should be participated in by everyone. Therefore, whether female, male, old, young, poor, or rich, they are all practicing donating money to buy airplanes.</p>
<p>At the same time, airplane tours are also being implemented.</p>
<p>So some people spend 50 silver dollars just to sit on an airplane for fifteen minutes for a tour.</p>
<p>This cannot be compared to those small clerks, elementary school students, and workers who save a few cents from their living expenses to make aviation donations.</p>
<p>But it is said that: at this time of bright spring, it is possible to take a trip in the air to broaden your mind and body. This is very good for your health. Good health can avoid the ridicule of being the sick man of East Asia, and it is also a way to win glory for the country.</p>
<p>Moreover, before, there was a woman who used her own natural feet to serve the country in front of the foreign devils. Later, during the national crisis, there were celebrities who fasted to save the country with their stomachs, and at the same time, there were those who used their conscience, using a good heart to save the country. In that case, things on a person's body can be used to save the country. Therefore, it is necessary to broaden your mind and body, broaden</p>
<p>It's good, so as to save the country. It is also necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, the effect of spending 50 silver dollars is equal to an aviation donation. This kind of aerial tour is also one aspect of saving the country through aviation.</p>
<h3 id="e224">### Liar <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>In ancient mythology, there was a story written like this: a woodcutter lost his axe, which was his only property. Losing it was the same as losing the way to live, so he knelt in the mountains and shouted to the sky, hoping that God would give him another axe. How miserable was this shouting! But I heard a similar miserable shout in the modern urban society.</p>
<p>One spring, near dusk, after a day of work, I went out of my room to prepare to go to the park. Just as I was about to cross the wide street, I saw a crowd of people gathered on the pedestrian path on the opposite side of the street. I went over to see, and in the crowd surrounding it, there was a slanting, overturned carrying pole, with many broken dishes scattered around. The owner of this carrying pole was an old man, wearing extremely tattered shorts and jacket. His legs, as thin as dry firewood, were completely exposed. His face was pale and terribly thin, and only a few sparse white hairs topped his head. His frail and pitiful body, carrying a carrying pole on the bustling streets of such a city, was bound to fall down at some point. But that carrying pole, the dishes on that pole, and the pot containing something like a powdered dumpling were his entire life, all his property. If the dishes and broken pot were broken, he would no longer be able to carry that pole to the street the next day, and then there would be no place to find rice for his life the next day.</p>
<p>He was picking up the broken dishes from the ground, crying loudly and jumping, which was exactly the miserable situation of the woodcutter in the modern city who lost his axe and shouted to the sky.</p>
<p>The people surrounding him were all sympathizing with him, but no one gave alms. At that time, I touched my pocket, and there happened to be a silver dollar inside. I stretched out the hand holding the silver dollar from the crowd, and the poor old man immediately knelt in front of me. I hurriedly turned and walked away.</p>
<p>Walking in the park, I thought about this. At dinner, I talked to my wife about this. Late at night, lying in bed, I was still thinking about this, and whenever I thought about it, my mood immediately became depressed.</p>
<p>My unhappiness seemed to be because this modern city showed its sin, but for this matter, I only saw half of it, and I did not fully understand it: I only saw half of the sin of this city, and I did not fully understand it.</p>
<p>Later, not long after, on another street, I saw another crowd of people gathered. In the crowd, there was the exact same scene as described above, and I recognized that still crying and jumping frail old man at a glance. I stared at the crowd surrounding it, the broken bowls and pots, and the crying and jumping old man, and a new discovery immediately appeared in my mind, and I said unconsciously: "Ah, this is a kind of deception!" This time no one gave alms, no matter how pitiful the old man's cry was. Soon, the police on the road came, dispersed the crowd, and ordered the poor old man to quickly pack up and leave. The old man wailed even louder, the police got angry and wanted to arrest him, and the old man simply rolled on the ground and refused to get up. I didn't have the patience to finish watching this scene, and I immediately walked away.</p>
<p>Walking on the road, this matter tormented my heart. At this time, my unhappiness was even more than before. At first I thought that this was a kind of deception. Later I thought that the old man who could not survive without resorting to such a miserable deception was even more pitiful. This city, this evil Shanghai, this devil's den that forces a frail old man to perform this kind of deception, should be destroyed soon. In the end, I regretted, why didn't I take out a little more money to help that poor old man before the police arrived!</p>

<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>"Hai Quan" Mo Mingqi Miao asked back in confusion.</p>
<p>"I want to write a eulogy couplet and send it to your home for you to hang up." ("I dare not, I dare not.")</p>
<p>Hai Quan said "I dare not" twice, ignoring Mr. Zhu and hurriedly jumped out of the car.</p>
<p>Twenty-Seven</p>
<p>Hai Quan finally found the alley where Cao Shiguang lived, near the Chinese streets of the concession. He thought, "This is the residence of the semi-poor and struggling." He saw that at least one chamber pot was placed at the back door of each house, and Hai Quan felt a little disgusted when he saw it. He found the house number and called at the front door for a while, but there was no response, so he went to the kitchen door at the back. The back door was open, and Hai Quan boldly stepped in. "Who are you looking for?"</p>
<p>A short, stout middle-aged woman with bound feet blocked his way.</p>
<p>("Is there a Mr. Cao, from Guangdong, living here?")</p>
<p>("There is.")</p>
<p>The woman seemed very arrogant, and it took a while before she replied loudly, "There is." If Hai Quan hadn't been a bit more tolerant this morning because of his fight with the Japanese, he would have argued with this local second landlord based on his usual temper.</p>
<p>("Is he at home?")</p>
<p>Hai Quan endured his anger and asked again.</p>
<p>("Who knows? Why don't you go up and see for yourself?")</p>
<p>The woman with bound feet ignored him and walked towards the front hall. Hai Quan thought, "Why are the Chinese always so unfriendly? They don't even want to help people with things that don't require any effort. They are always unhappy and impatient when telling people they don't know which way to go. Do they still want to live in this world? The philosophy of 'everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs' is too developed in China. No wonder the Chinese in the north are fighting with the Japanese, while the Chinese in the south are happily drinking with Japanese diplomats."</p>
<p>Hai Quan went straight up to the second floor alone. The attic and front rooms on the second floor were all locked. Therefore, there was no light on the staircase in between. He groped for a while before he could vaguely make out the dim outline of the staircase area. He went to the door of the front room and knocked.</p>
<p>("Who is it?")</p>
<p>A singing-like female voice. He thought, "This is undoubtedly Mrs. Cao. I met Mrs. Cao once at the church that day."</p>
<p>("It's me. Is Cao Shiguang at home?")</p>
<p>("Who are you?")</p>
<p>Again, a singing-like tone. Hai Quan imagined that Mrs. Cao was asking his child, which was why she was making such a moving, melodic sound.</p>

<p>— Xiao Shijun from Paris</p>
<p>(6) The World-Shaking Natural Feet</p>
<p>Natural feet are naturally bare feet. But here, it also carries another meaning, referring to the feet of celestial maidens. Because the magic of celestial maidens' feet is truly powerful. Regardless of whether they are natural feet, as long as they belong to a celestial maiden, they can make people kneel before them. The "lotus flowers with every step" praised by ancient Eastern poets and scholars were not natural feet. But they often faithfully confessed to willingly bowing down to pomegranate skirts, and Westerners are the same. Although they worship natural feet, aren't the owners of these two feet all celestial maidens? Regardless of ancient or modern times, regardless of China or abroad, foot worship is probably human nature. If scientists encounter this, they can simply define it as a general rule.</p>
<p>However, when I went to the Moulin Rouge in Paris to see Mistinguett's dance, I couldn't help but feel a surprising sense of astonishment. She is a world-renowned dancer who has accumulated millions of gold solely with her two feet. Not only has she captivated thousands upon thousands of Parisians, but also the serious-looking British and Germans, the culturally sophisticated Italians, the Spaniards who produced the mad knight, the Americans who want to pave the entire earth with gold, and even the Jews, sons of God who want to redeem humanity, are all followers of her two feet. I thought to myself, "Since her two feet have such great power, she must be a celestial maiden who can save sentient beings with her beauty." But when I saw her dancing naked on the stage, I felt not so much the joy of being drunk with gold and paper, but rather a heartbreaking sorrow. Life! Life! A fleeting life like lightning and flint! It disappears in an instant! Mistinguett, the owner of the world-shaking natural feet, although she used 100,000 gold as insurance for one of her feet, and adding the other, it is naturally 200,000, this number can greatly shock the poor Easterners, but she can never use gold to retain her youth. She is now over sixty years old. She has amazing skills. When she dances, I feel that the transformation of Guanyin, as described by the poet Wu Meicun of my country, "bending her back and sticking to the ground, the lotus flower spitting," is not enough to describe even a ten-thousandth of it. However, ruthless time cannot forgive her after all, and countless lines are engraved on her jade face day by day. Perhaps because I am an amateur when it comes to dancing, when I watch her perform, I feel that it is not as interesting as watching a plump young girl in another entertainment hall, Folie Bergere, rise and fall on the stage, like thousands of reds and purples waving in the spring breeze. To me. Their elastic waists, the interweaving of straight lines and curves, and the soul-stirring rhythm, in the eyes of connoisseurs, compared with Mistinguett, naturally have a distinction between elegance and vulgarity, but I think it is not so far apart.</p>
<p>Sure enough, I am not alone in this regard. Since Paul Morand wrote an article titled Magie Noire to promote black art, Parisians have developed a special interest in the dances of primitive peoples in the Near East. And these dancers are mostly in their prime. When they stand naked in the center of the stage, like bronze statues, there is a simple and pure fragrance that penetrates the heart. A certain black woman was even praised by Parisians as the Black Venus. And the Indian dancer Nyota Inyoka also became famous for a while. Her dances are divided into four types: ancient Indian dance, modern Indian dance, ancient Egyptian dance, and modern Egyptian dance. She has never been to India. She was originally born from a mixture of Indian and Egyptian people. Her dance costumes and stage equipment all come from her personal designs, so they have a different flavor. Later, a pure Indian girl, Shan Kar, also achieved considerable success on the stage performing pure Indian dance. Other dances of various shapes and colors, one after another, all compete with Mistinguett, the owner of the world-shaking natural feet, for a day's glory. Therefore, now her fame is gradually like her age, with a feeling of the sun setting in the west.</p>

<p>Sharp Increase in Financial Bullion Prices</p>
<p>The initial opening rose due to the American government's special permission to transport a large amount of cash back to Italy / Mid-session, Western merchants Xiang Meng and speculators covered their short positions and increased their bets, resulting in even higher prices</p>
<p>Fluctuations of 36 yuan, an increase of 38 yuan / A selling spree suddenly appeared after the close, once reaching within 77 yuan</p>
<p>The bullion market continued to rise yesterday. The initial opening rose because foreign telegrams from London indicated that the near and far spreads were both narrowing by 0.25, New York silver prices fell by half a point, British and American prices remained unchanged, British and American spreads narrowed by 0.9375, and forward silver market prices were slightly more than 0.03 taels. American cotton prices rose by 1.2 pounds per sound. Private bank telegrams indicated a narrowing of 0.375, indicating extreme stability. The market opened immediately and rose to 1052 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened flat, then tightened. Banks were initially slightly conservative, so bullion prices once fell to 1049.5 yuan. Thereafter, the market gradually improved. June US dollar exchange rates rose from 30.5 yuan to 3.75. At this time, the price was 54.5 yuan, as it was expected that HSBC's listing would reveal a narrowing of 0.125 shillings and a narrowing of 0.375 US dollars. When the formal announcement was made, the banks were all conservative, so the price rebounded to around 50 yuan. However, thereafter, things took a turn for the better, and the domestic market gradually tightened. Many buyers rushed into the market, and the banks repeatedly lowered the US dollar exchange rate, softening to 30 yuan (June). It was still at 9 taels, and the bullion price broke through 60 yuan, eventually tightening to within 30 yuan. Buyers in the market were brave, adding to 1067 yuan. The afternoon close was 1066.7 yuan. The market opened higher in the afternoon, immediately adding to 1070 yuan, then retreated from 71 yuan to 67.5 yuan. HSBC's listing caused both British and American exchange rates to narrow by 0.25, and the foreign exchange market tightened further. Bullion prices rose sharply accordingly. Guangbang worked hard to enter the market, and the June US dollar at 29.5 yuan was difficult to settle, breaking through 80 yuan and reaching 1083.5 yuan, the highest price since the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan. However, there were quite a few people taking profits at the high price. Zhejiang sold the June US dollar at 20.375, and the market turned around, gradually loosening and the bullion price retreated to within the 80 yuan mark. Thereafter, the foreign exchange market loosened further. The June US dollar at 29.625 could be settled, falling to 75.2 yuan. Finally, market sentiment remained stable, and bulls worked hard, so the closing price was 1083.5 yuan. The city-wide rise in prices was frequent. The initial opening rose because the US government had specially permitted the return of a large amount of cash (worth 8.5 million yuan) to Italy. Mid-session, Western merchants Xiang Meng and speculator Yang Mou covered their short positions, Wu Mou increased their bets, and Guangbang vigorously purchased, making the market even stronger. The spot price added 37 yuan, and the swap spread for April and May was approximately 38-39 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1052 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous close. The price of goods opened at the same price. The foreign exchange market opened flat. Initially, the near-term price was 1 shilling 8.5 pence, and the US dollar was 29.5 yuan, so there was no special good sign. The market then retreated to 1.5 yuan, and the foreign exchange market tightened. The initial price changed to 1 shilling 4.375, and the US dollar was 3.75. Hengyu first entered the market at 5 yuan. Daxing Yong came to sell at 2.8 yuan. Mitsui purchased the July US dollar at 6.875, and Hengxing Changsheng Yong all purchased it, rising to 5 yuan. The current month's US dollar could be settled at 1.4375. Yuanheng Fuxing Yong Zhaofengchang all came to sell. Citibank also sold the April US dollar at 29.5 yuan, rising to 1 yuan. Huabi sold the April US dollar to Mitsui at 0.5 yuan. Fuyu Hengyu came to sell aggressively again, breaking through 50 yuan and falling to 49.5 yuan. Speculators all raised the price to 51, and Fengyong came to enter, rising to over 2 yuan. Pan Gen came to purchase the June US dollar at 3.75. Qingfa Yong entered even more, to 5 yuan. Shunli sold slightly, at 3 yuan. Xingye sold the June US dollar at 30.5 yuan. Although Tianfeng Yong entered the market, it was still unsustainable due to the power of the sellers. Although HSBC's listing was announced at this time, with the shilling down 0.125 and the US dollar down 0.375, the market had already anticipated it, so it was not affected at this time and continued downstream. The banks all sold the April US dollar at 29.5 yuan. Yuankangxiang sold it, and speculators all pressed down, falling to within 51 yuan and struggling multiple times. When the banks traded the June US dollar at 30.375, Zhejiang sold it to Zhongfu. Hengyu entered the market and paid 2 yuan. Yuankangxiang suddenly came to aggressively enter, rising to over 3 yuan. Hongli Xiexing Yong came to buy it again. Mitsui purchased the July US dollar at 6.875, rising to 6 yuan. Mitsubishi even ate the June US dollar at 30.25. Fushun Fuchang Qianchangxiang all came to compete for it, jumping to 7.8 yuan. Tianfeng Yong sold it, gradually reaching 5.5 yuan. Shenkang purchased aggressively, reaching 7 yuan. Furthermore, because Hengxing Tianfeng Yong all purchased, Mitsui lowered the June US dollar by only 0.125, market sentiment was greatly boosted, and the trend was upward. Dadecheng purchased aggressively non-stop, rising to over 60 yuan. Once this level was broken, the situation rapidly advanced. Although there was a fallback of over 2 yuan, the trend was still strong. Yuanheng Qianchangxiang Daxing Yong rushed to buy, and the market suddenly turned around to cover short positions and go long, making rapid progress. Fuchang also came to enter the market, rising to over 4 yuan. The foreign exchange market was even better, and the June US dollar at 30 yuan was also difficult to settle. Runchangyu and others all had purchases and were good to 5.5 yuan. Speculators sold slightly, at 4 yuan. As the market was about to close, the buying frenzy was even greater. Hengyu Daxing Yong strove to purchase, and although there was no transaction for the June US dollar, it was already at 29.875, adding to 1067 yuan. Before long, the afternoon close was 1066.7 yuan. After the close, buying interest remained, and Yuanmaoyong and others all purchased, once reaching around 70 yuan, so goods were auctioned at 1069 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened and immediately jumped to 1070 yuan. Qingfa Yong first entered at 71 yuan, but because there were many sellers, Zhejiang sold the June US dollar at 29.75, and Fuyu Yifeng Yong all came to sell, falling to 67.5 yuan. The foreign exchange price for the current month's US dollar was 29, and the June 6.875 could only be settled. Shenkang entered the market to purchase, still around 70 yuan. The June US dollar at 75 could not be settled, and Yingfeng Heng Hengxing Hengyu also came to pay, rising further to 72.6 yuan. McCarley Huabi released the June shilling at 3.125, and Daxing Yong sold it, gradually retreating to within 70 yuan, at 69.5 yuan. Qingfa Yong came to enter, and it was pulled to over 72 yuan again. HSBC's listing caused both British and American exchange rates to narrow by 0.25, and Tianfeng Yong entered to over 3 yuan. The June US dollar at 6.875 was eagerly paid by banks, and Qianchangxiang entered the market to pay to 4.5 yuan. Thereafter, the buying interest was excited and rapidly rose, and Hengxing Yuankangxiang competed to enter to 8 yuan. Zhifeng Yong also purchased. Hengxing had not yet reached its quota, and there was a rush to over 80 yuan, reaching 80.05 yuan, which was 360,000 US dollars in June. Zhifeng Yong徵 had sales, retreating to 78.8 yuan. Hengxing's entry and exit here was very troublesome, and the price also hovered around 80 yuan. Zhaofengchang followed the trend and bought, and once again broke through to over 80 yuan. Xiexing Yong paid even more, reaching 2 yuan. The June US dollar was especially difficult to settle at 29.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market was extremely tight. Hengxing bought aggressively, and it leaped to 1085.5 yuan. Zhejiang then released the June US dollar at 3.75. Qianchangxiang sold to 4 yuan. The market situation was changeable, and thereafter suddenly fell. Fuyu Fuchang competed to sell to 3 yuan, Daxing Yong Yuanmaoyong came to sell again, at 1 yuan. Sumitomo sold the June US dollar at 0.5 yuan, breaking to within 80 yuan. Small traders sold, and bullion prices fell even further. Zhifeng Yong Daxing competed to sell even more, falling to 76.4 yuan. Then there was peace, and it hovered for a long time. Hengxing then entered again, raising it to 9 yuan, but because the situation loosened, it was unable to pull it up. Hengyu Dadecheng Zhifeng Yong Shunli all came to sell, still seeing the downstream, and the June US dollar at 625 could be settled. Hengyu sold even more, falling to 5.2 yuan. Thereafter, trading gradually decreased, and the situation became volatile. When Hengxing came to buy again, it gradually improved to over 80 yuan. Market sentiment was temporarily stable, and as the market was about to close, speculators all paid, and Yuanchun and others also had purchases, rising to over 83 yuan. Before long, the closing price was 1083.5 yuan. After the close, the selling frenzy started again, with violent waves, and the plunge was also fierce. Hengyu Yuanheng Zhifeng Yong all had sales, breaking to within 80 yuan. Daxing Yong's selling frenzy did not stop, and he came to sell even more, falling to within 77 yuan. Goods were also pressed down, because there was a double price relationship. The final price of goods was only 1075 yuan. The highest price during the day was 1085.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 1049.5 yuan, with a difference of 36 yuan. The result was that it rose 38.5 yuan from the closing price last Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Because HSBC's listing of the US dollar exchange rate was narrowed by a total of 0.625, accounting for 28.75 yuan, the alloy price was over 1159 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 75 yuan down, less than 14 yuan weaker than last Saturday. The current month's registration was 1092 yuan, the fourth corner was the same, the May portion was 1067 yuan, the morning water supply was 1092 yuan, the afternoon current month registration was 1109 yuan, the April portion was the same, the May portion was 1084 yuan, and the water supply was 1109 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot price was opened at a premium of 37 yuan, and the trade within the field was only done among peers such as Yingfeng Heng Dafeng Heng. Thereafter, the formal transaction was 37.5 yuan, and customers came to sell, and there were still many payers. Jiangxi帮 sold to Tongfeng Heng at 2 taels, and the price also added 37.5 yuan, with a turnover of 140 taels.</p>
<p>For the April-May swap, Dadecheng paid Yingfeng Heng 70 points at a price of 26.8 yuan. Runchangyong paid Tongfeng Heng 889 points, and Cuitai paid 21 points. Tongfeng Heng all paid 29 yuan, Daxingyong paid Yingfeng Heng 27.5 yuan, and 28.5 yuan, for a total of 14 points. In the afternoon, Dadecheng paid Hengyu 35 points, accounting for 28 yuan. Except for Tongfeng Heng's huge position in the local market (rumored to be central), the rest were zero points. Zhifeng Yong划 gave Hengxing 700 points at a price of 1092 yuan, to be accounted for in April. As of the 18th, 175 points remained in the March points, and 9317 points in April.</p>
<p>In March, Yingfeng Heng解 released 63 points, and Runchangyu收 entered 28 points, Dafeng Heng 21 points, and Dashun 24 points, for a total of 63 points to收解.</p>
<p>In-field transactions showed supply exceeding demand, with Hengxing Dadecheng Qingfa Yong Qianchangxiang Shenkang Tianfeng Yong Xiexing Yong Runchangyu Yuanheng Fuchang and others all entering, and Daxing Yong Yuanheng Fuxing Yong Zhaofengchang Fuyu Shunli Zhifeng Yong and others all selling. Those covering short positions included Shenkang Daxing Yong on behalf of Western merchants. Those adding to their positions included Qianchangxiang Hengxing. The Dalian帮 slightly exited. Guangbang Hengxing's entry and exit in the morning were roughly equal, and the subsequent market軋 entered, with approximately 1,000 points. As of the 18th, the points for May totaled over 20,800 points.</p>

<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, the near and far ends of the London large bar all narrowed by 0.25, the British exchange rate against the US remained unchanged, while the US exchange rate against the British narrowed by 0.9375, so the British exchange rate opened near-term at 1 shilling 8.4375 pence. New York silver prices narrowed by half a point, and the forward silver price on the gold exchange also narrowed by slightly more than 0.03 taels. Private bank telegrams then narrowed by 0.375. American cotton also did not fluctuate much. The US exchange rate opened near-term at 29.375 yuan, and there was no surprising development at first. The banks all had the intention of holding back. When HSBC's listing was announced, the shilling narrowed by 0.125 and the US dollar by 0.375, the situation began to improve. Xiang Meng covered his short position, and Mitsui aggressively lowered the US exchange rate, so the June US dollar gradually softened from 30.5 yuan to within 30 yuan. At noon, Mitsui was still paying 29.9375 yuan. In the afternoon, it tightened further, and the banks were all pulling back the June US exchange rate at 29.5 yuan, which could not be settled. Reaching 29.375 yuan, Zhejiang finally acted and sold it out. The market situation suddenly loosened thereafter, once hardening to 29.625 yuan in June, which could be settled. The closing price was flat again, with the near-term price for the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 8.125 pence, which was 0.375 tighter than the previous close, and the US exchange rate at 28.75 yuan, which was 0.75 tighter than the previous close. Among the banks, Mitsui was the most aggressive in pulling back, but HSBC also slightly pushed back on the shilling. In addition, the pushback was extremely tight, and the swap was seen to be narrowing, so the forward term was tighter than the near term today. The British-American exchange rate was once traded in June at 352.6875, with Mitsui paying half a penny for the shilling and receiving 0.125 US dollars. The in and out transactions of the bank during the day are recorded below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, both silver dollar and silver interest rates were stable, at 0.04 in both the morning and afternoon markets. The drawdown plus water was also at 0.08-0.09, with no significant rise or fall. However, the transaction and Qianzhuang bank settlement situation in the market was quite lively. A total of 370,000 in early-market remittance and draft payments and 1,030,000 in afternoon. Checks were especially numerous, with 250,000 in the early market and an astonishing 820,000 in the afternoon. Banks收解洋款 3.3-3.4 million, silver款 17 million, 400,000入倉, 800,000出倉, 2.8-2.9 million in Qianzhuang draft and delivery payments易洋款, 3.6-3.7 million silver款, 1.05 million plus Qianzhuang洋公单收解, 2.1 million plus Qianzhuang银公单收解洋劃頭款收解 310,000 silver劃頭款收解 390,000, over 700,000 in small Qianzhuang transactions.

<p>Before Significant Developments in Current Affairs</p>
<p>Bond Stagnation Intensifies</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange and public bonds remained sluggish. There seemed to be a gradual emergence of bulls on the No. 47 bond, but the volume of retail investors entering the market was not strong, leading to a noticeable decrease in trading. Most were still in a holding pattern, observing the situation. With no definite progress in diplomatic and military matters, the market was dull, and bond trading appeared slow and weak. In the morning's first session, several of the leading bonds rose slightly by one or two cents. However, later, due to some selling of the No. 47 bond, they fell back by one or two cents, and investor sentiment seemed slightly weakened. In the second session, there was even more selling of the No. 47 bond. Although there was some demand for the No. 1 and No. 11 bonds, supply still exceeded demand, leading to a drop of two or three cents, sometimes even four cents or more. The afternoon session opened with still sparse investor interest, and market prices were unusually stable, with highs and lows differing by only one or two cents. The distant salt tax bonds were particularly firm. At the close, demand for the No. 11 bond was relatively high, and retail investors were also buying in, pushing the price up uniformly by one to four cents, with the consolidated salt tax being particularly strong. As a result, apart from the April issue of the 1929 bonds, which rose slightly by five points, the remaining bonds fell slightly by one to five cents or more. Regarding the March futures, as the settlement date approaches, the bulls and bears cannot maintain this stalemate for long, and a fierce competition is expected within the next two to three days. The total transaction volume was 5,146,000 yuan, of which only 1,000 yuan was traded in the 1929 bonds in the spot market. In the futures market, only the demobilization bonds and the salt inspectorate bonds had trading volumes exceeding one million, the consolidated tax bonds had just over 800,000, and the 1929 bonds and the 22 bonds had only 400,000 to 500,000 each. The inheritance bonds and the 1929 charity bonds had just over 100,000 each, the 18 bonds and the regular 6 bonds had a total of 100,000, and the 96 bonds had only 5,000.</p>

<p>According to a report from Sincere Trading Company, the New York stock market showed increasing stagnation last Saturday (the 18th). Railroad stocks rose by several cents to three dollars due to good freight reports. Other stocks saw minor fluctuations. Short positions were slightly covered before the close. Half-day trading totaled 576,000 shares. Also, during the week ending March 11th, there were 437,813 railroad cars carrying freight. Considering the current stock market situation, barring unexpected developments, there may not be significant changes in the short term. The government's recent construction projects, the gradual balancing of the budget, the passage of the beer bill, and the improvements to commercial banks and the revision of bankruptcy laws are all sufficient to gradually restore public confidence and promote industrial and commercial prosperity. However, the reorganization of railroads and the consolidation of insurance companies still need to be addressed urgently. During this period, the stock market and commerce will inevitably be hampered. The Dow Jones indices are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 60.56 Down 0.17</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 29.09 Up 0.51</p>

<p>Yarn Activity Extremely Weak</p>
<p>The yarn market is extremely sluggish and lacks any revitalizing spirit. Actual demand is too stagnant, and there is no hope of improvement. However, most buyers are holding tight because the base is small. Arbitrageurs continue to operate this month, and the market atmosphere is calm.</p>
<p>People's Standard Plunges into Torpor. The People's Standard market opened with a very light atmosphere, and there were no price changes in any month. The afternoon session opened still weak. At the close, there were reports of 700-odd bales of spot yarn trading, and the market slightly increased, with each month rising by one cent. The total daily trading volume was 15,100 bales. Sold: Sincere 1,050 bales, Changfeng 850 bales, Renfeng 550 bales, Chun Kee 400 bales, and Yuantai 500 bales. Bought: Dafeng 1,000 bales, Xiesheng 1,350 bales, and Yiyu 950 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Spot Sales Still Lack Improvement. Spot yarn sales were higher than the previous day. A total of 747 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day, and the prices were similar to the previous day. The amount purchased by each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo 25 Changsha 97 Inland 173</p>

<p>The cotton market is slightly firm, but the overseas cotton market remains flat. However, as the gold market trends higher, bullish sentiment is intensifying. Furthermore, there is talk of a short squeeze on the Ningbo Exchange, and some are pulling in to go long in Shanghai, causing excitement in the market. According to general reports, approximately 3,000 piculs will be received this month, prepared for shipment to Ningbo for delivery. However, spot cotton business remains sluggish, and with the yarn market weakening daily, there is no intention to purchase high-priced raw cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Market Vigorously Rises. The Zheng Standard market opened with a tight atmosphere despite the weakness in foreign cotton. The Ningbo group purchased large quantities, and the market atmosphere</p>
<p>was relatively high, with each month rising by five points to two cents and a half. The afternoon market situation remained good, with each month flat. The total daily trading volume was 38,600 piculs. Sold: Dafu 1,100 piculs, Senkang 900 piculs, Changyu 1,000 piculs, Changfeng 800 piculs, and Ruiyuan 1,100 piculs.

<p>The local Yarn and Cloth Exchange has already resolved that cotton yarn transactions will be priced in silver dollars starting with the September term, and cotton transactions will be priced in silver dollars starting with the October term. The unit of cotton will be five silver cents, and the unit of cotton yarn will be ten silver cents. Also, for cotton yarn transactions starting with the September term, each piece should pay a basic margin of eight yuan in silver dollars, and those who should pay an additional margin should pay four yuan in silver dollars per piece. For cotton transactions starting with the October term, each picul should pay a basic margin of three yuan in silver dollars, and those who should pay an additional margin should pay one yuan and five jiao in silver dollars per picul. Also, considering that September is the time when cotton is between seasons, trading in the September term should be suspended for one month starting from April.</p>

<p>Downriver Rice Drops in Price After Peak</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were forty to fifty boats of arrivals. Urban and rural shops had some appetite. Tianjin merchants purchased over one thousand piculs. However, due to the surge in arrivals, the market softened. Prices for Suzhou, Tong, Qing, Jia, Nangang, and other types of rice fell by five cents to over ten cents. However, high-quality rice was still able to hold its ground. If arrivals become slightly scarcer in the next day or two, there may still be hope for a turnaround. Duyang and Jianyin Yuan rice sold evenly, with no gain or loss in price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over forty boats of arrivals from various groups from downriver. There were few arrivals of Chang group white japonica rice. Sales of high-quality and mid-grade rice were slow. Lower-quality rice was still considered not bad. The market showed high prices for short distances and lower prices for lower-quality rice. Arrivals of thin japonica rice were few and sales were sluggish, with prices down slightly over ten cents. Early rice arrivals and sales were balanced, and prices were flat. Duyang and Jian rice arrivals were continuous, but retail sales were slow, and prices were down by over ten cents. Port rice also dropped slightly by over ten cents. Passenger rice prices were flat.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Flour and Wheat Both Deserted <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Flour: After the market opened in the morning, prices for each month generally showed a calm trend. Prices for imported wheat, both US and Canadian, were down by about ten to twenty cents, so the market sentiment was flat after the opening. Both buyers and sellers tended to shun each other, and development was difficult. Ultimately, due to the increasingly severe situation in the north and the extremely tight silver supply for various road merchants, there was no interest, which was a natural trend. By the time the afternoon session opened, the market for each month tended to be flat and weak again. Henan merchants slightly sold out this month, while smaller factories engaged in hedging. For the distant months, larger factories continued to sell, but because there were limited buyers, the number of sales was few. Currently, imported wheat is still arriving continuously, so the factories' selling has not stopped. As a result, this month was down slightly by two and a half cents from the previous day, the April, July, and August months were slightly better by two and a half cents, and the May and June months were unchanged.</p>
<p>Wheat: After the market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices for each month tended to hover and stall. Imported wheat was down by ten to twenty cents, and buying and selling in all directions was unusually desolate. Merchants who had no relationship with it did not even inquire, so although imported wheat had significant ups and downs, the market hovered as usual. It can be seen that the lifelessness of the market is not something that can be remedied in a short period of time. As a result, the prices for this month to August were the same as the previous week.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Train Beans Re-enter the Four-Tael Range <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Sesame has transactions</p>
<p>There had been no transactions in train beans for many days. Yesterday, an export merchant bought 100 bags of Zhengyangguan beans at a price of three taels, nine cents, and six li. In short, because other merchants have no large appetite, the market for train beans has re-entered the four-tael range. It may not be easy to exit the range for a while. The sesame market has been dormant for a long time, and the market has been weak because foreign firms are not moving and everything relies on scattered sales. However, the market has been slightly active recently because foreign firms have completed a transaction of 200 shuns of spot goods at a price of seven taels and seven cents, delivered at the wharf. The remaining futures transactions were not completed because the counteroffers did not match.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Sugar Market <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Returns As Gold Prices Rise</p>
<p>Up one cent to seven and a half cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a rise in market price of gold, while the exchange rate of Dutch currency slightly decreased, thus, the market appeared tighter. The Association set the price of No. 24 coarse sand white ordinary grade at fifteen taels and one cent. The buyers did not accept that price, then slightly increased it to fifteen taels and two and a half cents, but other buyers were not willing to follow suit, thus presenting a tighter market situation. No. 20 medium sand white was priced at fifteen taels and six cents, up one cent, and No. 8 Dutch red was eleven taels and six and a half cents, and No. 9 was eleven taels and seven and a half cents, both up five cents. Hainan red was opened for sale in over four hundred packages, priced at nine taels and seven cents to six and a half cents. The Chao Qing number market saw slightly active trading. Yesterday, a total of approximately 400 packages were traded, priced at eight taels and seven cents to eight taels and forty-five cents. Jian ice was still sluggish, with only a small number opened for sale. Double Lion white ice was twelve taels and four cents. The factory's soft white opened at a higher price, at fourteen taels and two cents and five fen.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Oil Market <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>White Tung Oil Weak Development</p>
<p>Since the foreign trade of white tung oil has been decreasing year by year, the market has almost become a slump. Recalling the prosperous atmosphere of the past, one cannot help but feel the rise and fall. Although the producing areas of Sichuan and Hunan have suffered losses, they have expressed their willingness to hold on to not sell cheap. However, with no hope of a turnaround, holding on for a long time only increases costs, and even if there is a loss, they have to sell it painfully. As such, the market cannot be saved. According to the details of the Hankou letter, 800 to 900 piculs of Xiang tung oil were opened for sale, priced at eleven taels and seven cents in cash, and 150 piculs of Hunan support basket tung oil, at eleven taels and seven cents, including tax. A foreign firm in Shanghai sold twenty tons of tung oil at twelve taels and seven cents, without tax, weighed according to foreign regulations without deductions. Foreign firms have not traded for several days, and the price is still around fourteen taels and six to eight cents. Hankou firms wholesale at around eleven taels and six to seven cents. The local tung oil firms believe that the price of Hankou tung oil is similar to that of Zhejiang tung oil, so the goods can be sold both south and north. Last night, Hangzhou firms came to Shanghai to sell 200 to 300 pieces, priced at 22 yuan and six jiao, for foreign sales, but the market was extremely sporadic, so there were no large-scale transactions.</p>
<p>Metals: Large Lead Bars Reappear with Rising Trend</p>
<p>The recent transaction of large lead bars still did not see much progress, as the tea firms still hold a wait-and-see attitude, and the paint companies and tin foil factories also purchased limited amounts, so the market is quite cold. However, foreign prices have turned stronger, and the foreign exchange rate in Shanghai has become more expensive, so the price segment is expected to have a chance to rise again. It is currently estimated at eleven taels and two and a half cents, which is better than two and a half cents before (it is heard that the price dropped to the lowest of ten taels and seven and a half cents during the recent foreign exchange chaos, but it was only for a very short time). It is found that there were two to three hundred bars sold yesterday, and the market price of Hunan lead was ten taels and eight cents, and the transactions were very few.</p>

<p>Beiping: According to an officer who escaped from Chengde, since Chengde fell, not many Japanese troops have arrived. The Japanese army headquarters forces the local maintenance association to budget for the meals of 5,000 people every day, but only four to five hundred people eat, and there must be chicken for every meal, resulting in almost all domestic chickens being searched. Recently, the Japanese army has been forcibly conscripting local merchants into the army, dressing them in Japanese uniforms, carrying empty guns and empty ammunition pouches, and having the Japanese command them to form teams and parade around the streets to confuse the public. A Japanese person manages three Chinese people, so that the public would not know how many tens of millions there are. When they depart, the Japanese soldiers would scold the Chinese soldiers if their footsteps were a bit chaotic. Japanese planes fly from Jinzhou every day to scout and then return. The Japanese army recently used over twenty heavily loaded cars to transport the dead and wounded from the Battle of Gubeikou to Caoshi in front of the Chengde Imperial Palace and burned them. The public is full of resentment. (20th Telegram)</p>

<p>Visited Chairman Lin This Morning</p>
<p>Will go North to Comfort the Soldiers in the Coming Days</p>
<p>Nanjing: On the morning of the 21st, Wang Jingwei had his diabetes tested by his accompanying doctor Luo Guanghuo, and the result was that it had increased by over thirty degrees compared to when he was in Singapore, and his digestive power was also weak. After receiving a purgative treatment, he visited Chairman Lin again at ten o'clock to discuss political affairs, and said that because his health had not recovered, it was difficult to win the victory, and he planned to ask Song to truly take over as the president of the Executive Yuan, while he himself would continue to serve in the central government, work together, and deal with the national crisis. It is heard that the central government's decision on whether to approve Wang's resignation as president of the Executive Yuan will be discussed and decided at the Central Political Conference on the 22nd. As for the affairs of the Executive Yuan, Song instructed to consult Wang, who had already returned to Nanjing. Wang instructed to consult Song, as he had not yet resumed his post. Therefore, the outstanding events in the Executive Yuan must wait until next week before the Executive Yuan can open to deal with everything. Wang Jingwei will convene a discussion meeting with the ministers of various ministries at the Tiebu official residence on the 22nd to discuss the policy towards Japan and his own resignation as president of the Executive Yuan. (21st Daily Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chu Minyi said that President Wang has always been very responsible for national affairs and unwilling to be negligent. This time, he is willing to do his best to serve in the central government, so he only stayed in Shanghai for one day, met with old friends, and then rushed back to Nanjing. Now, his health is difficult to bear the burden, and it is already a heavy responsibility to preside over the central committee and the standing committee of the central political committee. If he also serves as president of the Executive Yuan, his illness will inevitably worsen, and the outside world may suspect that it is a political illness. Therefore, Wang still hopes that Song will truly take over, and he can offer advice at any time. When Wang returned to the country, he had not fully recovered. When he was in Singapore, the sugar content was one in a thousand, but when he was tested in Shanghai, it had increased to one in one hundred and forty, which had worsened. He is still continuing to recuperate in Nanjing, and the doctor has ordered that he must have absolute rest from one to three in the afternoon every day, and after testing the blood, he plans to open a purgative in the coming days to remove the accumulation in his abdomen. It has not been determined when he will set off to visit Chiang in Baoding. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Peng Xuepei told reporters on the morning of the 21st that Wang plans to go north to comfort the soldiers at the front in the coming days. Wang Zhuang should meet in the near future, but it has not been determined whether Chiang will come south or Wang will go north. Wang has not fully recovered his health and cannot return to work. The problem of the president of the Executive Yuan should be resolved in a day or two. Wang and the central government both prefer Song to truly take over. (21st Daily Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: President Wang went to the National Government at 9:30 on the morning of the 21st, then went to the official residence to visit Chairman Lin for half an hour, and returned to the residence. At 10:30, the ministers of various ministries, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Shi Qingyang, Chen Yi, Xu Xiqing, Shi Ying, etc., went to visit him together and urged Wang to return to work. In the afternoon, he followed the doctor's orders and rested at home, and planned to return to visit the ministers of various ministries after three o'clock, and visit Zhang Ji, Juzheng, etc. (21st Daily Telegram)</p>

<p>France Prepares to Join</p>
<p>European Four-Power Pact</p>
<p>British and French Prime Ministers Meet Today</p>
<p>Germany's Attitude Still Unexpressed</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: According to the latest news from Paris today, the talks between the British and Italian prime ministers in Rome have indeed shown signs of improving the European situation. According to Paris news, there is now a possibility of rapprochement between France and Italy. It is heard that after consulting with cabinet members tonight, French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet will tell the British counterparts at the meeting tomorrow that the French government is willing to support the work of the British authorities in Rome. It is believed that the repeated statements in recent days of the talks on how much good results can be achieved in the diplomacy of European countries without the use of force will certainly have a very pleasant psychological effect, so as to promote the restoration of world trust. According to informed sources, France is preparing to participate in a convention of mutual consultation, but at the same time, France must have sufficient time to study the details.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 20th: This agency's diplomatic correspondent believes that when French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet meet with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon tomorrow, they will express friendly support for the plan proposed by Rome. The French authorities believe that the Italian plan is a diplomatic expression that will have a significant impact on the development of international relations in European countries. Moreover, because the French have always had objectives that are in line with the Italian plan, the French authorities are particularly willing to support the Italian authorities' peaceful policies. As for the measures to prohibit the use of force, it will certainly have a very good psychological effect at present, and it will be of great benefit to restoring world credit. Therefore, France is prepared to participate in the proposed treaty. However, at first glance, there seem to be some points in its implementation that need to be substantially amended. French representatives will have to request a long-term study. The world should know that this treaty will include the revision of peace treaties and the recognition of Germany's equality of armaments, and its impact will be far-reaching. Therefore, France must first study it in detail and understand its reasons before it can sign it.</p>

<p>Havas, Washington, 20th: The plan proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has attracted great attention from political and journalistic circles, but the State Department remains silent. The State Department is deeply aware of the difficulties in bringing the views of France and Germany closer together, and regards the Italian plan as a way to restore peace in Europe. President Roosevelt believes that the recovery of American industry and commerce depends on the success of the disarmament conference and the world economic conference, and even partial success will be beneficial. Therefore, Roosevelt is very worried about the overall situation in Europe. American disarmament representative Davis will probably meet with French Foreign Minister Bonnet.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 20th: The local press is very happy about the results of the talks between the British and Italian prime ministers, but their arguments are very prudent. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia said that the policy of combining the four major powers is not a new name today, and its purpose is to start uniting from the main members of Europe, so as to achieve peace in Europe. The newspaper Il Messaggero said that the Italian plan is only to restore order between countries, and does not target any country. The organ newspaper Il Lavoro Fascista said that British Prime Minister MacDonald fully agreed with Mussolini's views.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 20th: Political circles have criticized the results of the talks between the British and Italian prime ministers, and are quite in favor of the newspaper's explanation of yesterday's communiqué, saying that it can reconcile the interests of those who agree to amend the treaty and those who agree to maintain the status quo. However, the Manchester Guardian raised a point that it considered to be very important. The newspaper believes that amending the treaty may harm Poland.</p>

<p>Havas, Belgrade, 20th - Political figures here are quite worried about the proposed Four-Power Committee plan by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, which excludes the Balkan Small Entente nations (i.e., Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia), and believe that this policy may bankrupt various organs of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 20th - The plan proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is not only applicable to the four major powers, it is explained here, saying that it can prove the importance of tomorrow's talks in Paris between British and French authorities. Also, because MacDonald is very concerned about Poland and the Small Entente countries, the key to the problem lies in the meeting in Paris.</p>

<p>The Murderer Goes to His Execution Calmly</p>
<p>Heavy Guard Around the Prison</p>
<p>Reuters, Lealford, 20th - Zangara, the murderer who failed to assassinate President Roosevelt and mistakenly killed the mayor of Chicago, went to his execution calmly in his prison cell at 9:15 this morning. Dressed in striped cloth pants, a white short shirt, socks but no shoes, he went straight to the electric chair, looked back at the jailer and said, "You know, I am not afraid of death, don't bother to catch me and seat me." After speaking, his expression remained unchanged, he sat down boldly, and listened to the jailer placing the leather straps on his hands and feet, and adding an iron cap to his head. After the arrangement was completed, there were about thirty people in the room. Zangara asked, "Are there any people here who have brought a camera to film me?" The jailer replied, "No." Zangara then shouted, "Capitalists are a bunch of cunning thieves!" Then he leaned back in his chair, smiled and said, "I bid farewell to the world, goodbye." In an instant, the electric button was turned, his body straightened, his head stretched out, and his hands remained in their original position. After three minutes, the current stopped, and this strong murderer had already died. Before his execution, Zangara gave a roll of paper to the prison official, saying that it was a manuscript of his book. This morning, the prison was heavily guarded, with two machine guns placed on the roof to prevent accidents. At 9:27, the authorities announced that Zangara was dead, but how to dispose of his body has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>Hitler to Implement Dictatorship</p>
<p>National Socialist Party Submits Memorandum to Parliament - Communist Conspiracy to Assassinate Hitler Foiled</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 21st - The National Socialist government's memorandum to Parliament requesting dictatorial powers has now been published. It demands that Parliament allow the current government to exercise dictatorial powers within the executive branch or before March 31, 1937. This bill allows the government to promulgate laws that conflict with the constitution and to abolish the jurisdiction of Parliament and the Federal Council over this legislative bill and foreign treaties.</p>
<p>Reuters, Munich, 20th - Today, the police here foiled a conspiracy to assassinate Hitler. It is said that one German and two Russians, who must be communists, went to Hitler's residence and placed three hand grenades and gunpowder next to the Horrell monument near Mr. Hitler's residence. When they were working, someone passed by and saw their movements, so they went to inform the police. The police rushed to the scene immediately, but the three had already escaped in a car waiting for them. The police believe that the assassination plan was prepared to throw grenades at Hitler when he went out. Even if someone sniped at any new government official today without hitting him, the result would inevitably cause unprecedented chaos that would be irreversible. Hitler has already flown to Berlin this morning.</p>

<p>MacDonald Disarmament Convention</p>
<p>Naval Ministry Instructions to Be Mailed to the Japanese Delegation in Geneva</p>
<p>Saying That Its Content Is Based on Europe and Has Nothing to Do with the Far East</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 21st - British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan will be put on the agenda of the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference on the 25th. The Japanese delegation in Geneva telegraphed the Naval Ministry yesterday, requesting that the research materials necessary for discussion be sent to Geneva. The Naval Ministry plans to mail them this month. The Japanese government will express its full opposition to the British plan. The opinions of the naval authorities are summarized as follows: 1. The British plan consists of five parts, namely, security guarantees, arms reduction, concessions and exchanges, scientific warfare, and the Standing Disarmament Committee. It only aims to concretize the decisions made by the Disarmament Preparatory Committee. The figures, in addition to adopting the Hoover plan and the British claims, only add security guarantees, scientific warfare, and the establishment of a Standing Disarmament Committee, and have no fresh significance whatsoever. Its content is entirely based on Europe and has nothing to do with the Orient. 2. Regarding the six articles on security guarantees in each part, it is intended to negate the conclusions that are effective against countries that violate the non-war treaty, and its content is abstract and has no concrete plan. It is expected that France will express its opposition and the agreement cannot be established. The second section of the second part on disarmament, and Articles 25 to 33 of the second chapter, cannot be supported by Japan for the following reasons: (A) The London Naval Treaty is a provisional treaty until 1936. It will be revised after 1937, but this plan does not change it and prolongs it, so it cannot be supported. (B) It is absolutely opposed to establishing this as a universal general treaty with countries around the world. (C) From a practical point of view, according to this plan, an agreement can be reached at the earliest at the end of the year. When the Five-Power Naval Conference in 1935 is imminent, the effective period of this agreement is only one year. Therefore, there is no need to rush to conclude this agreement today. It is more effective to establish regulations on naval armaments other than those of the London Treaty countries. (D) At the Geneva Disarmament Conference, since a new agreement with different content has not been established, this plan has not once given the Japanese disarmament plan that should be submitted at the 1935 Naval Disarmament Conference a formal opportunity for proposal, so full vigilance must be maintained. (E) In Chapter 3, regarding the abolition of aerial bombardment in Article 34, the Japanese side reserves its support because it is related to the total abolition of aircraft carriers and other matters. (F) In Article 37 of Chapter 3, the military weight of aircraft shall not exceed 3,000 tons. This is to remove the threat from European countries. For Japan, a country with the longest coastline, it is most necessary to prepare aircraft with continued power, which is different from the situation in Europe. (G) Article 41 of Chapter 3 restricts the aircraft of the six countries of Britain, Japan, the United States, France, Italy, and Russia to 500 aircraft, and wants to establish an abolition regulation. It cannot be agreed to unless an agreement on land and sea forces and the absolute prohibition of aerial bombardment is established.</p>

<p>Recalling the Ambassador to Britain</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Today, when the Lower House was in session, a member asked about the arrest of British engineers at the Soviet Vickers Electrical Company. Foreign Secretary Eden stated that negotiations on the British-Russian trade agreement have been suspended because in the current situation, such negotiations are of no avail. He also said that the Soviet authorities entered the Vickers company offices on March 11 and searched and removed several documents, most of which were of a private nature. The next day, six British engineers in the company were arrested. Except for Rowell and Monkhouse, who were temporarily released, the rest are still in custody. The British Ambassador to Moscow has not been given the opportunity by the Soviet authorities to talk privately with the arrested persons. Although the Ambassador has repeatedly inquired about the details of the case, the Soviet authorities have not told him. He has now instructed the British Ambassador to ask the Soviet Union to allow the arrested persons to be given unrestricted legal assistance because they must be fully aware of their crimes when they are interrogated. It is rumored in London that the Soviet government has recalled the Russian Ambassador to Britain, Maisky. Today, the embassy issued a statement that this is not the case.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 20th - Today, the Lower House discussed the Soviet arrest of British engineers. Many members raised questions. The government replied that the British Ambassador to Russia had lodged a strong protest with the Soviet authorities, stating that the long-term detention of nationals had a serious impact on relations between Britain and Russia. It also explained to the Soviet government that the reason why British-Soviet commercial negotiations were temporarily suspended was indeed this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Soviet Defense in the Five-Year Plan <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>This article is a report by Voroshilov, Chairman of the Military Committee of the Soviet People's Committee, at a meeting of all party workers in the Moscow garrison on January 20, 1933, translated from the Izvestia newspaper on January 24, 1933.</p>
<p>The growth and development of the Soviet Red Army are progressing simultaneously with the growth of the proletarian state, not lagging behind the development level of its productivity and technology. In fact, it cannot but be so, because the Soviet Union is now in the midst of an imperialist hostile encirclement. Without perfect and sound military equipment, it cannot exist for a day. Therefore, the Soviet government pays special attention to the Red Army. At the same time, Soviet national defense cannot but be reflected in the five-year plan.</p>
<p>Since its history, the Red Army has proven that it has fulfilled its duties to the fullest extent. We have repeatedly declared to the workers, peasants, and masses across the country that in order to fulfill its duties, the Red Army will never allow the enemy to cross the sacred border of the Soviet Union under any circumstances. This oath is indeed true. The strength of the Red Army lies in its special political and moral status and spirit, as well as its high degree of revolutionary consciousness.</p>
<p>The Red Army's arms were inherited from the old Tsarist Russian army, and the old Tsarist Russian army was the most backward in Europe. During the revolutionary period, the improvement of the Red Army's weapons relied only on the military equipment seized from the White Guards and foreign imperialist intervention forces during combat. In the years after the end of the civil war, during the recovery period, the Red Army's weapons were still not improved, firstly because the Soviet Union did not yet have an industrial foundation sufficient to solve this major problem, and secondly because the old army did not leave behind skilled military cadres. All the military equipment of the old army was imitated or imported from foreign countries. Therefore, it is the basic task of the five-year plan in national defense to seek technical transformation of the Red Army based on the progress of the new industrial industry. Therefore, reorganizing the Red Army based on the establishment of a new type of weapons manufacturing industry is also the focus of our work.</p>
<p>During the five-year plan period, the results in this regard are no less than in other aspects. The Red Army at the end of the five-year plan is very different from the Red Army in 1927 and 1928, just as the current economic structure of the entire Soviet Union is different from that in 1928.</p>
<p>To what extent has the technical transformation of the Red Army now reached?</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of machine gun weapons, the significance of machine guns in modern defense is known to the world. In short, modern army lower-level organizations, even down to small units, cannot defend themselves without sufficient machine guns of various types. At the end of the World War and thereafter, in defensive battles (such as defending against infantry, aircraft, and tank attacks), in addition to heavy machine guns, there were also portable machine guns, anti-aircraft machine guns, and large-caliber machine guns, etc. For this reason, in 1928, the Soviet Red Army had nothing but heavy machine guns, namely the old Maxim machine guns. Even the heavy machine guns were relatively few in number. At that time, the Red Army had no portable machine guns at all. What it had were various old-fashioned machine guns made abroad. These machine guns were not only technically too old, but also extremely scattered and insufficient for military use. Therefore, they were also military equipment with very little combat power. What was especially fearful was that at that time, there was no foundation for manufacturing heavy artillery at all.</p>
<p>In addition, at the time of the Soviet Union's prosperity, it naturally had no aircraft machine guns, no anti-aircraft machine guns, and no tank machine guns. Therefore, in the five-year plan, our efforts to reorganize military equipment focused first on the supply of new and powerful machine gun weapons of various types.</p>
<p>Significant achievements have indeed been made in this area. The Soviet Union can now manufacture all the above-mentioned machine guns, and their styles are no less than the latest in foreign countries. Especially in the manufacture and invention of rifles and machine guns, a large number of military equipment technicians, experts, gunsmiths, and young engineers have been trained and are still continuing to study and improve. These talents are all selected from workers in old machinery factories and have now become reliable and experienced military technology cadres. Their technical knowledge is keeping pace with the rapidly advancing technology of Europe and the United States. It is no exaggeration to say that the technical problems facing the Red Army can be solved easily. The Soviet Union has now invented new automatic rifles, automatic pistols, and other new types of military equipment. These military equipment are being manufactured on a large scale in Soviet factories.</p>
<p>During the years of the five-year plan, the Soviet Union not only created new shooting and machine gun weapons, but also established a new military industry. If the enemy attacks the Soviet Union, the Red Army will have sufficient automatic weapons to guarantee.</p>
<p>The Red Army's artillery weapons were even worse before. The significance of artillery combat equipment in modern warfare is extremely important. After the World War, the armies of capitalist countries made rapid progress in improving artillery and artillery systems. The old artillery of the armies of France, Britain, Italy, and the United States has been almost entirely modernized. In terms of range and speed, they have reached the point where nothing can be added. Not only that, but also the relationship between artillery units has fundamentally changed, and the number of shell guns used has greatly increased, and many new types of military equipment have been added.</p>
<p>In this area, the Soviet Red Army's difficulties are no less than in shooting and machine gun weapons. In the manufacture of shooting and machine gun weapons, it is still possible to select the required talents from the old gunsmiths, but in the manufacture of artillery weapons, there is no design at all. What the old army left behind is either dead, uneducated, or affiliated with the pro-Soviet regime. So we retrained talents and established a design agency dedicated to very complex and technically advanced work. Now the Soviet Union's old artillery has also been renovated, and the achievements made in range and speed are no less than those of the new artillery in Europe today. Whether it is small-caliber guns or various new heavy artillery and new anti-aircraft artillery, the Soviet Union can manufacture them itself. The lower-level organizations of the Red Army, even platoons and companies, are equipped with all kinds of artillery to resist tanks, all kinds of special military equipment carried by infantry platoons and companies, and weapons to defend against enemy short-range machine gun nests.</p>
<p>In addition, we have also invented many new types of artillery. The results of the tests have been very good. They are now being manufactured on a large scale in Soviet factories.</p>
<p>What is the main victory in this area? It lies in the fact that during the first five-year plan, the Soviet Union established a strong foundation for manufacturing its own artillery, established a powerful ordnance design bureau, trained skilled talents and engineers for military equipment manufacturing, and established many factories sufficient to solve the problems of the Red Army's artillery equipment.

<p>Kneels Down to Sell His Daughter into Prostitution</p>
<p>(Havas Tokyo Correspondence) It is often the case that young Japanese women are sold to brothels by their parents. It is a long-standing custom and is not considered strange. Japanese girls are devoted to filial piety and do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to use the money from selling themselves to relieve the family's difficulties, which is truly pitiful. But recently, there was an even more peculiar incident, because the person being sold was a married woman, who should obey her husband in principle, and her parents have no right to dispose of her. This woman is twenty-one years old. She married last August and had a harmonious marriage. Last month, her father summoned her to return home, took her to Osaka without telling her the reason. The woman did not think it strange and happily went with him. She did not expect that her father had sold her to a brothel for 800 yen, and she would only be free after five years. The woman was shocked when she heard this and was unwilling to engage in this lowly occupation. Her father knelt down in front of her and told her that the 800 yen had already been paid and was about to be used up, but the family was in difficult circumstances and could not get out of it without this. The woman, unwilling to disobey her father's wishes, tearfully agreed. But then she thought of her innocent husband, how could she bear to betray him? So she escaped from the brothel and went straight to the police station, begging for help. The police also did not know what to do. This is also strange.</p>

<p>Xi'an dispatch: Yang Hucheng led his entourage, including Mi Zanchen and Zhou Fanbo, on an inspection tour of eastern Shaanxi on the 8th of this month. After arriving in Tongguan, he received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoning him to Shijiazhuang. Yang took the Longhai Railway east on the afternoon of the 8th, arriving in Zhengzhou at 9:30 AM on the 9th. He briefly rested at No. 24 Longhai Road. After breakfast, he headed north from Zhengzhou at 11:00 AM, arriving in Xinxiang at 2:00 PM. Zhang Ji, a member of the Central China Office, and others welcomed him at the station and had a lengthy closed-door meeting in the dining car of Yang's special train. Zhang and others expressed great indignation at the retreat from Rehe without a fight and particularly admired Yang's request to volunteer to fight against Japan. They hoped that Yang could lead troops to the front to carry forward the past revolutionary glory. He headed north at 5:00 PM, arriving in Handan around 11:30 PM. Wang Ziyi, the commander of the 84th Division garrison, greeted him at the station. After a brief conversation, they departed. The train arrived in Shijiazhuang at 5:00 AM on the 10th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's special train also arrived at the station a quarter of an hour later. Yang greeted him on the platform and then went to Chiang's train for a conversation. He excused himself after about half an hour. At 4:00 PM, he was summoned to Chiang's special train again for an audience. After meeting Chiang, he requested instructions on detailed plans for resisting Japan and reported on the recent political situation in Shaanxi. The conversation lasted about three hours. According to sources, it was exceptionally satisfactory. That evening, Zhang Ji and other Central Committee members from the North China Office came to Shijiazhuang, and Li Zhigang, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, also came from Nanjing. During his audience with Chiang, Yang presented the plan to relocate the arsenal to Luoyang and the second-phase project plan for the Jinghui Canal to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which were greatly commended. Approval has been granted to submit them to the Economic Committee for review and assistance with funds. On the 11th, Division Commander Jing Yuexiu responded to Yang's telegram and arrived in Shijiazhuang from Taiyuan. They discussed Shaanxi's political and military affairs and disaster relief. Jing and Yang have a deep friendship and have shared hardships for nearly ten years since their separation, so they were very happy to see each other. At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 12th, Chiang's special train went to Baoding, and Yang's special train also left Shijiazhuang at 5:20 PM, heading south. At 10:00 AM on the 13th, he arrived in Zhengzhou. He originally planned to return west that afternoon, but according to the Zhengzhou office of the Pacification Commissioner, Chairman Liu of Kaifeng, Director Liu Xueya of Nanyang, and Commander Zhang Boying telegraphed, stating that they were summoned north by Chiang and requested that Yang wait in Zhengzhou. Therefore, he temporarily suspended his departure. That evening, when the trains of Liu, Liu, and Zhang passed through Zhengzhou, Yang greeted them at the station and had a lengthy closed-door meeting. At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th, the train departed westward, arriving in Luoyang after 8:00 PM. At 8:00 PM on the 15th, he arrived in Tongguan, where he transferred to a car westward.

<p>The Volunteer Army in Northern Manchuria Rises Up</p>
<p>Surrounding Various County Seats and Fiercely Fighting the Japanese Army</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun on the 14th, when the Japanese army previously conducted large-scale suppression of the volunteer army in various parts of northern Manchuria, most of the volunteer army was broken up into smaller units or lay dormant in Russian territory, waiting for an opportunity to reorganize. Now that winter has passed and the severe cold in northern Manchuria has subsided, the volunteer army in various parts of northern Manchuria has once again risen up, mobilizing in various places, causing the Japanese army to be exhausted. According to the information received by the Japanese military authorities regarding the volunteer army in northern Manchuria, as follows:</p>
<p>1. On the 8th of this month, the volunteer army attacked the Japanese army stationed in Baoqing County. Both sides engaged in a fierce battle for three hours. Japanese police instructor Ichikawa and Sangji were killed by the volunteer army.</p>
<p>2. On the 10th of this month, the volunteer army leader Sanxia commanded 1,000 volunteer soldiers to occupy Dongning County, capturing and killing Japanese Councilor Kuwahara Ikuo and translator Miura. Two members of the Japanese garrison and two members of the security team were killed, and five Japanese soldiers were injured.</p>
<p>3. At 11:00 PM on the 11th of this month, 400 volunteer soldiers suddenly attacked a small station on the Harbin-Suifenhe line, engaging in a four-hour battle with the Japanese army, killing two Japanese security team members and destroying the railway, causing the train from Harbin to Suifenhe to be temporarily disrupted.</p>
<p>4. On the 11th of this month, Chen Dongshan led 2,000 volunteer soldiers to surround Mishan County. The battle is still ongoing. The whereabouts of Japanese county councilors Yasuda and Fukuda are unknown.</p>
<p>5. On the 13th of this month, Shen Qinglin led a large army to attack Weihe on the Eastern Railway Line and surrounded the county seat, killing Wen Pengshan, the head of the puppet security group.</p>
<p>According to general speculation, a large number of volunteer soldiers will appear in various places along the Sino-Russian border.</p>

<p>Preparing for the Second Agricultural Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center is preparing for the second agricultural exhibition to promote farmers' competitive production. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice: China is vast and rich in resources. In recent years, due to the economic aggression of the great powers and the farmers' adherence to old ways, production has been short-lived, and the trade deficit has increased year by year, forming a picture of economic desolation in the countryside. If no measures are taken to encourage production, the consequences will be dire. In order to promote farmers' competitive production, the Center has decided to hold the second agricultural exhibition in April of this year. A preparatory office has been established and letters have been sent to various places to collect products. Shanghai is the central hub for the gathering of special products from China and abroad. We sincerely request that you forward this letter to various industry groups to prepare products and send them for display in order to promote progress and enrich the people's livelihood. We would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Methods: (1) The scope of collection is mainly agricultural products from this county. Special products from other counties are also welcome to be displayed at the exhibition. (2) The types of collection include crops, horticulture, forestry, livestock, aquatic products, agricultural manufactures, agricultural implements, films, and circular tables. (3) Collection organizations: district offices, social education organizations, district farmers' associations, and agricultural</p>
<p>organizations. The exhibitors should register and arrange the collected products according to the form, fill in the labels, and send them to the exhibition for display at the specified time. (5) Collection dates: from the 20th of this month until one week before the opening of the exhibition. (6) Disposal of exhibits: Except for the items borrowed for the exhibition, the exhibits collected will be returned or retained as appropriate according to the results of the review. (7) Awards: The exhibits deemed excellent by the evaluation committee will be awarded by the Center.</p>

<p>Tomorrow to the Maritime Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications carefully navigated and strictly formulated the regulations on the qualifications of marine engineers and issued them to the Ministry for verification and issuance of certificates, only those with certificates are allowed to work on commercial wheels. On the one hand, it also instructed the various wheel bureaus to dismiss all marine engineers who do not meet the qualifications, have no academic background, and have not been certified by the Ministry, and to replace them with certified personnel. However, the glorious decree of the Ministry has not been followed by the company, resulting in nearly one hundred marine engineers with certificates being unemployed, while the employment of marine engineers without certificates on the wheels is ubiquitous. Today, all marine engineers who have received the Ministry's certificate have resolved to go to the Maritime Affairs Bureau tomorrow to petition Director Zhu Yaoting, requesting compliance with the Ministry's decree to provide relief and ensure fairness, so as to reduce all kinds of tragedies in the maritime industry.</p>

<p>The Dalian Steamship Company competed to load Northeast soybeans in order to open the Dalian-Europe route, which was previously reported in this newspaper. The company purchased six 8,000-ton wheels from the Canadian Steamship Company in England with 2 million yuan funded by Mantetsu. The crew and sailors had already been transported to Europe by Nippon Yusen to receive the wheels and sail them back to Dalian. However, last night, the Kamzhou-Beijing wheel received a telegram stating that it had encountered a strong wind in the waters off Mali Xi Ai Island in the North Pacific. The entire ship tilted and was flooded and about to sink. Currently, the crew and sailors have been rescued by a Kawasaki Company seagoing wheel. The crew and others are safe, but the ship is about to sink.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Land Value Tax to be Levied Soon <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>The collection of land value tax in this city has been prepared by the Financial and Land Bureaus since the beginning, and it has been a long time. Now I know that all the procedures for the collection have been arranged in order. However, the regulations on the collection, etc., were previously submitted to the Executive Yuan to temporarily order the Ministry of Interior and Finance to review them, but no reply has been received so far. In order to start the collection as soon as possible, the Municipal Government specifically telegraphed the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Interior and Finance to reply to the submitted regulations, etc., as soon as possible so that they can be announced and implemented. Therefore, the levying of land value tax is only waiting for the approval reply from the Executive Yuan, and the date should not be far away.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Case of Shooting Xi Lusheng <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>The Murderer Song A'er was Arrested</p>
<p>Xi Lusheng, a comprador of the former Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and a native of Dongting Mountain, suddenly encountered a number of kidnappers on Fuzhou Road on December 6, 1929, intending to kidnap Xi and extort a huge sum of money. Xi resisted, causing him to be shot and injured by the bandits, and he died soon after. Subsequently, the police arrested one of the kidnappers, Shi Jinde, and handed him over to the First Special Court, which sentenced him to death. When Shi was interrogated, he confessed that Song A'er (ie Song Jiahua) from Tongzhou was the principal offender. At that time, Xi was shot and killed by Song. The police immediately searched for Song, but never found him. Until 10:10 AM yesterday morning, Chief Inspector of the General Patrol Room Pang Ruiqing and Shen Jinwen discovered that Song was hiding at No. 2, Lane 257, Caishi Road, French Concession, so they cooperated with detectives from the French Concession Police to go to the address and arrest Song, taking him back to the police station for detention. This morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the previous situation, and said that the police investigation procedures were not yet complete, so they had not formally prosecuted and requested permission to detain him. Song also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Feng Shide, the head of the Criminal Division, verified the report, approved the police request, and ordered Song to be detained and questioned again at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e295">Three Fires This Morning <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>Taopeng Road In a lane on Taopeng Road, Yangshupu, the Zhu Senhe Guanquan shop at No. 3, caught fire due to carelessness at around 8:00 AM this morning, and suddenly the roof was pierced, and the flames soared, and also affected the houses at No. 1 and No. 5 on the left and right. Later, the fire brigade drove a pump car to rush to rescue, and it was extinguished after a while. It is estimated that three houses were burned. The fire starter was arrested by the patrol and taken to the police station for verification.</p>
<p>Robison Road The Tonghe Nanhua store at No. 1209 to No. 1210, Yinhua Lane, Robison Road, West Shanghai, suddenly reported a fire at around 9:20 this morning, which was out of control. In a moment, three houses were turned into ashes. Fortunately, the fire brigade worked hard to put out the fire, and it did not affect the neighbors.</p>
<p>Xizang Road The Shanghai Zilaihuo Company at the intersection of Xizang Road and Xiamen Road touched the asphalt pool due to the strong wind, which caused it to burn. The machine parts were also on fire. After the fire brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm, it was extinguished at around 4:00. Fortunately, the fire did not spread to the houses. It is estimated that about 1,000 yuan worth of asphalt was burned after the incident.</p>

<h3 id="e296">A Consistent Offensive Strategy <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Ji'an</p>
<p>Our country's diplomacy has always been uncertain. Every time an incident occurs, we still use the simple prescription of treating the headache when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts to fight against the ferocious and terrifying disease demon, 丨丨nationalism, resulting in the entire modern diplomatic history being almost entirely bloody records of shrinking territory. Look! The beautiful Chinese-crabapple-leaf-style territory inherited from our ancestors for more than 4,000 years is already gradually becoming an incomplete mulberry leaf eaten by silkworms, with a corner missing yesterday and a piece missing today, isn't it?</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a certain important person resolutely stated that the government's policy has always been consistent (how it was in the past), and will still be the same in the future. Then he said: Recently, a new diplomatic path has been negotiated, which is not only a softened compromise, but also an active and tough one. This fascinating diplomatic statement, which gives infinite hope, is like the sudden fragrance of roses to the countrymen, who feel refreshed and comforted in their hearts 丨</p>
<p>However, since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, some have sought a battle with the Japanese army's iron hooves, while others have endured humiliation and sought peace, and still others have maintained an ambiguous attitude, hoping to maintain a situation of neither war nor peace for a long time. I wonder what exactly the consistent policy referred to by a certain important person refers to? But if the phrase "(how it was in the past, will still be the same in the future)" is reversed, it becomes "(if you want to know what the future will be like, just look at how it was in the past)." So, what exactly was the past like? The facts are clear, and we can (understand each other without speaking) 丨</p>
<p>(If you can't plant seedlings, you can't see the dike). The so-called consistent continental policy of the Japanese, the change of emperors, is like this, and the old overturned and new groups of cabinets are also like this. The Qing-Japanese War of 1894 was the beginning of its continental policy, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, and the attack on Shenyang and the occupation of the Northeast on September 18, and even the recent capture of Rehe, all without exception are for its continental policy. People's consistent policy towards me is so grand and true, while my consistent policy towards people is so timid and false. Under the law of (when they extend, we contract, and when they contract, we extend), we can infer that the consistent policy in the mouth of our diplomats seems to be consistent) is indeed true, but the so-called (tough, active, new path) still needs to be resolved in the next episode in fact)</p>

<p>The bright heavenly gate raises beacons at night, the Six Tactics and the Golden Edition镇 are calm and composed. If the Red Knife has the blessing of Huang Gong, I beg for a magic talisman to subdue the poisonous dragon (the national government still speaks empty words of resistance).</p>
<p>Red walls and silver rivers are each a home, I want to subscribe to the immortal alliance and wish to buy it all on credit. A little telepathy has not yet been communicated, and the Weaver Girl of Penglai returns her car for this reason (Japan refuses to sign a non-aggression treaty with Russia).</p>
<p>The lotus platform reverberates with the sound of the tide everywhere, and the flower light of the meat bun reflects it solemnly. The white jade coffin becomes old in the sky, and people in the world falsely recite the Nirvana Sutra (reading Sun Yat-sen's will is a must at meetings).</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Since my wife returned to her mother's house the day before yesterday, only I am left in these old houses. During the day, I can open the front window and hear the laughter of the neighbors, relieving my loneliness. But when the darkness of night enveloped the earth, the lonely scene of the hometown made me think of ghosts and monsters. Unfortunately, I also caught a cold, lying drowsily on the bed, feeling uneasy in my heart. The courtyard was quiet in front and behind, and the occasional barking of dogs from the fields added to the terror of the night. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, staring at the kerosene lamp on the table. The lamp wick shrank even smaller, and the sound of the watchman's gong came from the street in the distance.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a rustling movement in the patio, disturbing the grass leaves in the north ridge. The sound slowly moved and stopped at the corner of the house, as if it had struck the iron drainpipe. The ghost flashed across my eyes like lightning, and the hideous shadows flickered on the walls of the room. I covered myself with the quilt, and it seemed as if someone was pressing down on me, and beads of sweat broke out all over my body. My hands and feet could no longer move on their own. Suddenly, with a (thump), as if something heavy had fallen into the water. I tried to stick my head out and brighten the lamp wick, thinking of getting up to find out what was going on, but in the end (ghost), I didn't dare to look out into the patio.</p>
<p>Because I thought of ghosts, the ghost stories I had heard as a child all came to mind, as if there were ghosts moving around my bedroom. In the silence of terror, I don't know how long it took before I fell asleep.</p>
<p>When I woke up the next day, I was still lying in bed very tired when I heard the maid's surprised cry.</p>
<p>(The kitten drowned in the water tank!)</p>
<p>That was a beloved kitten of mine, which I had only taken in a week ago. It slept in my room every night. Since I had been sick for two days, I had thrown the kitten out of my memory. Last night, I was able to think carefully about the origin of this sound and made a night of self-disturbance with doubts about ghosts. I put on my clothes and walked out. The maid carried the stiff-legged kitten in from</p>
<p>outside, as if to say (it's dead). I looked at it apologetically, if I had been brave enough to get up last night, wouldn't I have been able to save it? Ghosts, suspecting ghosts, lightly sent off a small life.</p>
<p>I also thought that the defeat in Shenyang and the loss of Rehe were not caused by the terror of ghosts like last night? Although the kitten cannot catch mice for the time being, it is a cat itself, so at least there is hope of catching mice. I lightly sacrificed a small life, and my heart was as if it had been cut.</p>

<p>— Jiang Shi-mei Ying</p>
<p>Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>I have been married for six years, and my husband treats me very well. For the first four years, our situation was just barely sustainable. Since last summer, my husband's business has become very successful; therefore, last winter, we moved into a Western-style house with rent of one hundred several tens of taels, and at the same time bought a new-style automobile. By right, my life should be happy and comfortable; but I have my own worries. My parents' family is in a difficult situation; I have eight siblings in total, apart from my two older sisters and me, who are already married, there are still three younger brothers and two younger sisters, who are still studying in school. My parents are really unable to support them. Furthermore, my two older sisters are married to ordinary men, so logically I should subsidize my parents' household expenses or help with my younger siblings' tuition fees. However, my parents are people who bully the kind and fear the wicked, and are extremely snobbish. So, before my husband prospered, they bullied me greatly, and also treated my husband badly. Now, because they want me to subsidize them, they have completely changed their attitude and treat me very attentively. They often ask to borrow my car, and beg me with tears and pleas to subsidize them with a hundred yuan per month for household expenses. I am unwilling to use the money my husband earned with his sweat and blood to subsidize such a snobbish family; but I cannot bear their tearful and pleading behavior. Please answer me, I am waiting under this difficult problem! With respect,</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely, Jiang Shi-mei Ying</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Human emotions are snobbish; this has been the case since ancient times. In the past, when Su Qin was still unsuccessful, he was also (treated such that his wife did not weave, his sister-in-law did not cook, and his parents did not speak to him). Later, when he wore the seals of office of six states and was about to persuade the King of Chu, when he passed through Luoyang, his parents greeted him in the suburbs thirty li away, his wife looked at him askance and listened attentively, and his sister-in-law crawled on her belly, bowed four times, and knelt down to thank him. However, we have never heard it said that Su Qin, because his parents, older brother, sister-in-law, and wife treated him badly when he was unsuccessful, therefore took revenge on them. Mrs. Jiang and Mr. Jiang, even if you suffered some grievances in the past, now that you have prospered and they are seeking your help, their insincere compliance is sufficient punishment for them. You should remember the bond of kinship and not hold it in your heart, seeking retribution! If your husband, because he is after all still a step removed, remembers the past and is unwilling to care for them, you must still persuade him from the side. How can you adopt a policy of (requiting every grievance) between parents, older brothers, and older sisters!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Among them were complimentary tickets for (Wanli Hong), (Qin Lou), (Fragrant Concubine), etc., meal tickets resembling paper money, powder paper for women, and bills from hotels and restaurants; the most shocking, however, were several pawn tickets, indispensable to every fallen person. The only souvenirs after pursuing pleasure and waking from a beautiful dream.</p>
<p>(Humph!) Mother was so angry that her face turned white. That night, she cried all night long. Wu Yi couldn't help but think of his grandfather and what he had said when he was dying, and he felt very sad. Starting the next day, he actually became a law-abiding citizen for a week.</p>
<p>A week later, the women's phone calls and the urging of his friends gradually disturbed his restless heart again. However, in order to avoid upsetting his mother, he decided to change his public actions into secret actions. Every night, after one o'clock, he would return home on time as usual without making a sound, deliberately making some noise to let his mother know that he had returned. Fortunately, he was lying in the attic. After pretending to sleep in bed for a while, he quietly sneaked downstairs and out the door. However, when going downstairs, he had to take off his leather shoes first, tiptoe, and slowly inch his way down the stairs. When he returned at dawn, he did the same thing.</p>
<p>He lived such a secretive and degenerate inhuman life for more than a year. One night, he slipped out as usual to spend his sweet spring night leaning on red and green, and only returned at 7:30 in the morning. Sleepy-eyed, he pushed open the door of the attic, breathed a sigh of relief, and was about to take off his clothes when suddenly he felt something more in front of him.</p>
<p>Under the fish-belly white dawn light shining in from the window, an old lady with a pale face and straight eyes was vaguely visible, collapsed on the deep red floor, with one hand still firmly gripping a jewelry store invoice for one hundred and twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Wu Yi trembled all over as if he had been electrocuted. He had realized, he had awakened: but his poor mother would never stand up again ㈥ Three Friends</p>
<p>"Little Wu, what are you still afraid of now? Tonight at the 'Mingzhu'!" Less than a month after Wu Yi's mother died, a group of degenerate friends who didn't want to be born on the same day but wished to die on the same day came to his door one by one, grinning and urging him to continue doing the work of "degeneration not yet successful, comrades still need to work hard." In their eyes, Wu Yi's mother's death was truly a great happy event for Wu Yi, and they almost congratulated him.</p>
<p>However, Wu Yi had completely awakened. He knew that from now on, no one could protect him anymore, and future success or failure depended on his every action. Therefore, he brazenly turned his face, cursed these worthless friends, and chased them away with a barrage of blows, staying alone at home for forty-nine days.</p>
<p>This day was the first day he returned to work at the Star Daily after suffering a great enemy. For some unknown reason, as soon as he walked into the newsroom, he felt a burning sensation on his face, as if he had a terrible case of hypocrisy, and he was so ashamed that he didn't even have the courage to greet his colleagues.</p>
<p>He hung his head and sat awkwardly at his desk. Looking at the desk, there was already a high stack of letters: looking at them one by one, a large portion were invitations to drink flower wine and invitations to gambling dens. There were also a few letters from friends asking him to publish publicity messages, among which there was only one letter expressing condolences to him.</p>
<p>This was written by his old classmate Wang Yulin. Wang Yulin's entry into history was not very glorious either, but he was not one of the people who contributed to Wu Yi's degeneration, because after graduating from the Education Department of X University, he went to Japan to study law, and after graduating two years later, he was busy opening a law firm, so he had not been in contact with Wu Yi for a long time. This letter was something that Wu Yi could not have anticipated, especially the sincerity of the words in his letter, which greatly moved Wu Yi.</p>
<p>"I've decided to see him tomorrow!" After reading many letters, Wu Yi hung his head and muttered silently to himself.</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Wu Yi! I've admired you for a long time! I've admired you for a long time!" At some point, a new colleague had been added to the seat opposite Wu Yi. A young man with a dark complexion, a strong build, and wearing a pair of large Locke glasses. This person didn't wait for Wu Yi to greet him, but put on a smile and started to be perfunctory. "My brother is Zhao Qianli. I studied psychology at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. Recently, I returned to China and was found by Mr. Zhang XX here to serve as the editor of international telecommunications. In the future, I will often have to ask Mr. Wu for advice!"</p>
<p>A friend who had been eating flour-flag bread for many years could be so humble; Wu Yi couldn't help but feel a sense of goodwill towards Zhao Qianli. So the two of them opened up and talked as if they were old friends meeting again; somehow, their conversation suddenly shifted to the issue of making friends.</p>
<p>"In modern times, friends have become interest exchange devices." Zhao Qianli said with the cold and witty expression that every psychologist often has, as if lecturing: "If you don't have money or power, you can forget about making friends for the rest of your life; or there may be someone who is willing to condescend to you, then either there are some antiques in your family worth his affection, or [illegible character] thief, or you must have a beautiful wife!"</p>

<h3 id="e302">Anecdotes of the Mouse Cartoonist, Walt Disney <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Ruo</p>
<p>I think people who often watch movies have seen the mouse cartoons that are often shown before the feature film, right? These films are very lively, humorous, and interesting. Walt Disney, the creator of these cartoons, seems to have been introduced in this magazine before. I will now describe a few of his anecdotes, which I think will also be welcome to the readers who love to watch his films, right? He originally worked for an oil company, but because he seemed very interested in satirical and humorous drawings, he often made paintings for recreation. He first made a satirical cartoon film for the Kasaas movie theater, and later made several satirical fairy tale films in a row to be shown in churches and schools, but he was not successful. At this time, he only had a pair of pants, a flannel coat, and a film camera. But he was not discouraged. He sold the camera for forty dollars and ran to Hollywood. His brother was a vendor in Hollywood. Without asking the reason, he took the two hundred and fifty dollars his brother had saved as capital and engaged in painting again. This time it was finally successful, and his interest was immediately recognized by people.</p>
<p>When he was making films for Universal Pictures, the people in the company thought he was too extravagant and suddenly canceled his contract. At this time, he happened to be in New York. He couldn't bear to let his twenty assistants lose their jobs. He immediately organized a Walt Disney Film Company.</p>
<p>He is now considered a great success. However, the reason why he is so diligently engaged in this business is not to get rich, but only for interest. Once. A friend asked him how it feels to be rich. He only replied (I don't know, I didn't pay attention to these). This is true, he didn't lie. He still lives in the old English-style house he lived in ten years ago.</p>
<p>But his success is not accidental, he really has talent. He was very interested in animals and painting when he was a child: he started painting at the age of five. He used thick asphalt as ink and the white wall as paper. All the books in his house were painted with many fraudulent pictures.</p>
<p>He still often goes to the zoo to take animal films as the only entertainment during his holidays. His wife often complains that she is a mouse widow.</p>
<p>He is very generous to the people he employs. He always tries to make their lives comfortable, he prepares all kinds of facilities for them. He lets them take generous salaries and only do a few things. I think such an employer is rare, and only people like him who do not aim to make money can do it.</p>

<h3 id="e303">Review of Considerate Handling With Care <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The structure is good, but the meaning is non-existent.</p>
<p>The director's skills are skilled, Nanjing screening</p>
<p>Here is a rather tortuous story.</p>
<p>A female clerk named Helen works in a department store and takes care of her sister's two children. One child is arrested for stealing milk to feed a cat. During the hearing, a young lawyer learns that he is Helen's nephew. Helen is the lawyer's former lover, so the two lovers are able to meet again. Later, the lawyer punishes the two children because of the evil cat, but Helen loves them as if they were her own, and the two eventually break up. In the end, the lawyer is robbed while dealing with a lawsuit and is rescued by the two children, so the two lovers are able to reunite and love the two children.</p>
<p>In such a story, the screenwriter has used some ideas very well. He has interwoven the entire plot quite tightly, without any coercion. Although there are many jokes, they are not so stiff as to make people bored. The best thing is that he mobilized hundreds of children, which is a new aspect in Hollywood films. But why did he write such a script? What is the intention? This is something we can't figure out. So this film has no meaning at all, it's just that he conceived such a script in his mind.</p>
<p>However, the director's use of this film is very flexible and skillful. He simplifies the unnecessary key points as much as possible, so that the audience can have a clear understanding of the progress of the whole play in front of short shots. He paid special attention to the performances of the two children. Buster Phelps, who is less than ten years old, is able to give such a valuable performance under his command, which of course is due to him. At the same time, he can always show his cleverness in the important key points: for example, when a child escapes out of the window, causing the washbasin to fall and make a crashing sound, when the robber hears the sound and enters, the two children improvise and play tricks on the robber. This is also a joke, but it is very clever. As for the police coming to arrest the robber, it is also very natural, but this is also the strictness of the screenwriter.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, although James Dunn and JBooots Mallors are the main characters in this play, the performance is very mediocre and the tasks they undertake are not seen as important. As for that child, Phipps D. Fils, he is very good. He is so realistic and lively that the protagonist cannot help but be overshadowed by it.</p>
<p>Lighting, scenery, and sound are not characteristic, but the editing is still ingenious.</p>
<p>Overall, this is not a very good film, but it is still worth watching.</p>

<p>The Da Zhonghua Film Company on Xieshang Road in this city was opened by a Westerner, Bailideng. It has now been found by the Nanjing Film Inspection Committee that the company has secretly filmed many humiliating films. The Ministry of Education and Internal Affairs has been requested to transfer this to the local authorities of this city for thorough investigation. It is now known that the Education Bureau has sent personnel to investigate. According to reports, the company has been reorganized into the Dahua Company, and its business has been suspended, but the address has been rented to the Qianghua Film Company, which does have [illegible characters] films, so the Education Bureau has ordered the company to stop filming on [illegible characters] days. The Municipal Film Review Committee and the Public Security Bureau will assist in stopping it.</p>
<h3 id="e305">Habitual Expressions on the Silver Screen <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ming</p>
<p>After watching many movies, before watching a certain movie, you don't need to know who the characters in the play are. If [illegible characters] wears broken leather shoes and walks with a figure-eight step, wears a narrow-brimmed black hat, you can tell at a glance that it is Chaplin. A thin man and a fat man making jokes together must be Laurel and Hardy. A hand often stroking the hair must be Bibi Danier. Wearing a skirt like an unfolded folding fan and constantly looking back at the clothes must be Jane Gaynor. It is more accurate than recognizing faces and will never be mistaken. On the silver screen, each actor has their own habitual expressions, which we can remember in detail. The success of these expressions is roughly divided into two reasons. The first is because they are deliberately made and become a habit, like Chaplin, Laurel, and Hardy. The second is a natural habit, like Bibi Danier and Jane Gaynor. Now, let's roughly record the habitual movements of each actor:</p>
<p>Mary Trance shakes like a rain-drenched chicken; Mary Pickford's curly and very long golden hair; Joan Crawford walks very fast with big steps; Li Lingkan stares straight ahead; Clara Bao drags her messy hair and stomps her feet; Ann Harding pulls her clothes from time to time when walking; Keen Harlow walks with her hips protruding, turns her head back from her shoulders, pretending to smile, and Greta Garbo raises her head and looks down.</p>
<p>Among the male actors, Clark Gable smiles a lot, Fan Pengke raises his hand to show courage, and Li Que Dikes flexes his muscles and clenches his teeth to pretend to be fearless, Wallace Piley sneers and scratches his ears, Tommy Hicks speaks in the ear of his horse Tommy, Li Que Baisames clenches his teeth to show fierceness, Li Ang Barimur shakes his head and ears like a fierce bear locked in a cage, John Barimur stands upright and arrogantly; Louis Stone bends over and is good at flattering, Adolf Meng Yu smiles with his eyebrows and eyes; Peis Kaiden is coldly aggressive; Lei Men Nuo Vallo looks at women without looking at others; Yare Qiao Ersheng dances with his feet off the ground; Locke widens his eyes from his glasses and pretends to be frightened, and Xifolai wears his straw hat crookedly. Many habitual movements can arouse interest, such as Chaplin, Peis Kaiden, etc., but only limited to comedians, as for other roles, they are annoying. So several actors like Helen Hayes, Naoma Shila, etc. have all removed their habitual movements, so they can't be found.</p>
<h3 id="e306">Metropolis Morning-Prelude <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Shenghong</p>
<p>Another film that shouts for the masses and closely follows the times is Lianhua's new film, Metropolis Morning.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Renmei plays a simple and lively village girl in (Metropolis Morning), innocent, romantic, lively and lovely. Gao Zhanfei plays a poor illegitimate child, and his brave and strong physique is just right for the coolie he plays who is struggling in a painful life. When he plays the scene where he understands his life experience on a stormy night and rushes straight to his biological father's house like a crazy evil spirit, the audience's heartstrings are tense and shaken with the character's mind.</p>
<p>The plot of this film is very tortuous, compact and moving, and there is no dull place from beginning to end. The young director Cai Chusheng also has a history in the directing world. His direction of (Metropolis Morning) may not disappoint.</p>
<h3 id="e307">Re-introducing (Pursuit) <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>Love is originally pure and sacred, it is indomitable in the face of power and wealth, but in today's society, women who generally like vanity only know that the price of love is money. Therefore, storms often arise in the sea of love, and there is no good result in the end.</p>
<p>The (Pursuit) recently produced by Tianyi Company is aimed at the love problems of young men and women today. Its central consciousness is to depict the vanity of modern women and make powerful criticisms, to write sacred and pure love, to serve as a lesson for men and women, and at the same time to advance to us; a warning of (the sea of love is vast, and the end is the shore)</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning is that several of the grand scenes in (Pursuit) are indeed worthy of the four-character commentary (magnificent and luxurious). At the same time, in terms of lighting and photography, there is much progress compared to (Double Mandarin Ducks in a Sea of Sin).</p>
<h3 id="e308">One is too much, how can it be again? <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Huai</p>
<p>(The film Song of Songs, was recently sued in court by the company because the protagonist Marlene Dietrich twice regretted the contract, demanding compensation for losses of 200,000 gold yuan. Marlene initially protested, but now suddenly sent her lawyer Robb Leun to discuss with the company's lawyer, and the result was satisfactory, and the film can continue.</p>

<p>— Jack</p>
<p>(Adding one more is also fine! But Dennis sneered and left the room with Mike.</p>
<p>After the sound of his heavy footsteps faded along the balcony, Dan sprang up from the bed. She grabbed Jude's arm and dragged him out to the balcony. Then, she returned to the room, slammed the door shut, climbed onto the bed, and fell asleep.</p>
<p>But Dennis and Mike returned to the living room and sat down to eat. Mike reached for his bowl and filled it with green beans, but Dennis poured himself a glass of brandy and drank it down. Mike then urged him to eat something. They exchanged a few words, but Dennis poured another glass of wine. They continued to talk.</p>
<p>"Do you think I'll grow old here?" Dennis said.</p>
<p>"Why don't you take a trip to Saigon?" Mike replied, his mouth full of beans, while scrutinizing him closely.</p>
<p>"There's no one trustworthy here, how can I go to Saigon?" Dennis drank another glass of wine.</p>
<p>"Actually!" Mike said with a teasing tone, "It wouldn't be difficult to come from Saigon:"</p>
<p>"Humph!" Dennis said sadly. He leaned back in his chair, half-closed his eyes, and smiled wistfully. "Mike, once in London after the war, there was a girl like cream-colored velvet—" His face tightened, and he stopped speaking.</p>
<p>After dinner, Dennis unfolded a farm map and listlessly examined it, instructing Mike on the work plan for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Outside, a tiger roared, as if challenging the night. Mike stood up and walked to the balcony.</p>
<p>"Jude is lying across the balcony," Mike reported.</p>
<p>"Let him lie there."</p>
<p>"Alright, I'm going to sleep. See you tomorrow, Dennis."</p>
<p>"See you tomorrow, Mike." Dennis opened his typewriter and inserted a sheet of paper. He was busy typing when suddenly a light sound arose beside him, distracting him.</p>
<p>Dan tiptoed into the room, sat on the table, and looked at the stern, nonchalant face with great interest. (To be continued)</p>
