<p>時評</p>
<h3>由哈爾濱到東京　·實　—北滿緊張東京弛緩—</h3>
<p>— ·實</p>
<p>蘇聯與日本之間。近以中東路問題。於緊張狀態中蘇聯爲鞏固邊防計。不得不爲萬一之備。日本亦調集在東北部隊於北滿。兩國之間。勢若舍武力而外。將無其他解决方法者。自日本東三省軍事發動以後。論者即謂日本對蘇對美。具有挑戰之决心。彼以爲美國主要軍港。距日本要塞均在三千海里以上。僅恃較爲優勢之主力艦。斷不能勝攻擊之任務且美國之輔助艦艇。類多年齡老大。作戰能力薄弱。欲其遠渡太平洋而與日本一决雌雄。在事實上難操勝算。以是即料定美國絶不肯爲遠東之將來利益。而遽爲軍事之冐險也。</p>
<p>蘇聯國基初固。五年計劃。方始完成。重工業之建設。正在着手以從事建立其社會主義之國家。故對外盡量維持友好關係。樹立和平外交。而亦不肯輕啓衅端也。因是日本乃敢於佔奪我國領土主權以後。且將驅逐蘇聯在北滿之經濟勢力。而代以日本之經營。</p>

<p>珠寳商楊壽生被綁　綁匪態度鎭靜路人不加注意　匪用汽車係向日人車行租得　原車因撞翻人力車而後發現　案情已有端倪各方協力查緝</p>
<p>昨日下午六時二十分、城内城隍廟一區二分所轄境内、發生一綁票案、事後匪徒汽車在法租界撞翻人力車、被岡捕阻止、心慌意亂、乃　棄車而逸、車夫在哥倫比亞路安和寺路被迫下車、茲將各情紀述如下、</p>
<h3>預伏二男子</h3>
<p>蘇州人楊壽生、年五十五歲、家住城内　城隍廟西光啓路第四號門牌、業珠寳商、數十年來、頗具私蓄、詎竟引起匪徒埀涎、但楊亦頗有戒心、故該宅門禁甚嚴、家人出入胥由華草浜附近弄内後内出入、即楊平人、亦復如是、楊每日上午十時許出外、在下午六時左右返家、昨日下午六時二十分許、楊事畢自外乘車返家、當其走入後門弄内時、突被預伏弄中二男子挾之登車綁架而去、</p>
<h3>汽車夫被逐</h3>
<p>昨日下午五時許、虹口三角地菜塲附近爲日人經營之森村汽車行内、突來華人三名、聲言欲僱車至靜安寺路、該行當即命車夫吳寳根、二十五歲、本地人、駕租界照會第一八零六六號而去、當開抵靜安寺後、車中三男子、突命車夫再開往哥倫比亞路、車夫當即遵言開去、詎及抵哥倫比亞路安和寺路時、車夫身後三人、突將車夫兩目用布紥緊、並喝令停車、並用繩將其手足縛住、拖出車外、棄於路旁、匪等乃始自行駕車而去、</p>
<h3>楊在車掙扎</h3>
<p>當楊壽生被綁時、路上行人甚衆、惟匪等舉動鎭靜、故未曾發覺、及匪等挾楊至方浜路、扶上預停該處之汽車上時、始被熟人窺見、以楊正在掙扎、同時見身旁之二男子袖内均暗藏手槍、乃知遭被綁、先擬呼喊、繼恐危及楊之生命、乃亟趨至車後、緊記該車照會號碼、租界第一八零六六號、奔至附近崗警處報告、並即轉報總局由文避長通飭全班偵緝員任壽芝等四出追緝、一面楊之家屬亦始得訊、分向各機關報告、請求援助、</p>
<h3>車夫之報告</h3>
<p>在下午六時四十五分許、公租界靜安寺路巡捕房内、突據該第一八零六六號汽車夫步行到捕房報告被縛、驅下汽車經過、並請轉知該行、一面追查汽車下落捕房得報後、即派探目金養吾等、往哥倫比亞路查勘一過、一面即通知各捕房、恊同搜索、距未幾市公安局方面通知發生綁架案文件、及偵緝員等亦到達該捕房、乃始悉該車實係綁匪租借、亟行加派探捕四出追緝、一面法捕房方面亦同接上項公文、派探偵查、</p>
<h3>汽車果發現</h3>
<p>至曉間九時四十五分左右、法租界福履理路　　突有一汽車自西向東、疾駛而來、惟該處以南北適有各車經過、不能前進、但車勢甚猛、煞車不及、又恐肇禍、車上駕駛者亟將車向行人道灣去、詎斯時適有一人力車在前、因此竟將人力車撞翻、車中駕驶者見已肇禍、即下車逃逸、及越捕追上、已屬不及、返視該車映於眼簾者、則租界照會第一八零六六號也、</p>
<h3>案已有端倪</h3>
<p>時越捕尙不知斯車係與綁案有關、因已無人駕駛、乃將車帶入盧家灣捕房、以該車居然發現、當即予以扣留、並轉知公共租界及市公安局、一面通知森村車行主、前往辨認、並檢騐車中遺跡、以便追查、車夫吳寳根、當時暫押靜安寺捕房、經捕頭訊問之下、認爲疑點甚多、嗣並探悉公共租界市公安局及法租界三機關、對於斯案已有相當端倪、行將恊力兜捕、車夫吳寳根以汽車押在法捕房、故即於當晚十一時五十分由靜安寺捕房移交法租界辦理</p>
<h3>新豐輪撞壞金利源碼頭　進口時不愼肇禍　九號碼頭遭損失　帮通撞進十五尺　浮橋兩座均毁落</h3>
<p>招商局北洋正班輪新豐號、此次由津還滬、先在白河與太古駁船互撞、繼遭擱淺、及至到烟臺、又與碼頭碰撞、船體微損、及至開抵上海、以靠埠不愼、竟將金利源九號碼頭撞壞、並毁浮喬兩座、損失甚巨、亟將詳情查誌如下、</p>
<h3>途中肇禍兩次</h3>
<p>新豐與新銘、爲招商局之正班輪、故局内向派資格最深之老船主充任船長、近因原任船長考充天津領港、局内派大副錢毓佳代理船主之職、上班赴津、在白河内先與太古駁船相撞、復遭擱淺、反至由津歸航、船到烟臺、在靠停碼頭時、因工作不愼、致與碼頭互撞、新豐船身當卽撞損、嗣用水泥等修理之後、便開來上海、詎料進口抵埠、將金利源碼頭撞壞、</p>
<h3>到滬撞壞碼頭</h3>
<p>新豐輪於星期日下午五時半到滬、其時天已漸黑、而船到南利源五號碼頭前、照例慢車漸上、便可靠泊、其時又值頂漸落水、更不致發生危險、在停靠上尤覺利便、詎新豐船至九號碼頭、欲攏帮通、而其船頭突向九號碼頭頂住、此時船舶未曾停車、新豐船頭自然向碼頭上開進、大副孫　閣見此情形恐肇衝毁碼頭全部、船頭直撞陸地之巨禍、急取大錨一座向左側抛下、以擋住新豐前進之力、否則新豐將直冲到岸矣、</p>
<h3>浮橋帮通損壞</h3>
<p>其時九號碼頭之帮通、經新豐船頭猛撞之力、致在水面　　設置之左側浮橋兩座、應用大鐵練、繫帶在碼頭上者、同時被新豐船頭衝斷、落在浦江岸邊、而九號碼頭之帮通、亦遭新醫猛撞、四處鐵練勾搭、盡行毁壞、帮通亦被撞進岸壁、損壞之處甚巨、事後據南棧碼頭管理員報告、九號帮通被新豐撞進十五英尺之多、左邊兩浮橋、完全折斷落水、損害數額尙須估計、</p>
<h3>旅客飽受虚驚</h3>
<p>此事發生生之際、船上由津南下、旅客甚夥、均準備到埠上陸、突見船身撞入碼頭、一時站在九號帮通及浮橋上之工人及接客者、突遭猛撞、多數人險被兩浮橋掀入浦江之内、當時紛向十號碼頭逃避、人聲鼎沸、秩序大亂、在船旅客、多館受虚驚、嗣經重打倒車、起去左側之錨、方得將船移靠在十號碼頭、及新豐停泊船身、已經深宵、</p>
<h3>船主到局報告</h3>
<p>船主錢毓佳於昨日上午到局、向船務科報告撞碼頭情形、據該船主言、新豐在五時另三分過立斯摩埃河筒、至五時另八分抵美孚碼頭前開半快車、過陸家嘴到海關前開慢車、經新開河已到江華輪後尾、開快倒車、拉三聲短笛、及到金利源五號碼頭前、再開快倒車、詎料舵葉不鑿轉、竞不受司機之命令、船向碼頭撞去、幸左側抛下一錨、否則損失更重、事後船主與大副等檢視何以舵機不靈發見船上偷帶稍包之私貨過多、而將舵之發動機關壓住、以致肇此禍端云云、以上係錢船主對記者言、聞其報告總局、亦根此點措詞云、</p>
<h3>勘查損失狀况</h3>
<p>局内得報、卽派工程股人員到南棧砥頭察勘撞壞情形、以便尅日修理、新豐船頭幸無大傷惟在白河與駁船擦壞、烟台與碼頭碰傷之處、須加修理、卽可開行、此次新豐肇禍、與去夏江靖輪船主朱文秉之撞太古德安輪情形相若、聞其責任當歸船主担負、</p>
<h3>傷哉一女子投旅社自殺　淚痕未乾口中流血　自稱宋妹底事輕生</h3>
<p>岳州路岳州旅社、於前日上午十時許、突來一女客、年約三十餘歲、自稱名宋妹、向該社賬房支錫香開定八號房間、當付洋一元、新時支即見其面帶愁容、淚痕未乾、然亦不知其原委、該女客步至房間後、即將門關閉、約逾二十分鐘許、荼役即按例泡茶與女、及推門入内、見其已倒臥床上、口中有血流出、訊之亦無所答、該茶役乃駭極、當即奔告賬房、轉報匯山捕房、飭探陳寳忠前往調查之下、遂將其送往上海療養醫院醫治無效、旋即身死、並經該院醫生察見該女頸間繞有繩子一根、尸體舁入斐倫路騐尸所、昨晨、由第一特區地方法院委派郭煒檢察官蒞所騐明尸體、訊據支錫香投稱前情一過、郭君遂諭騐得死者女性宋妹、委係生前服毒身死、尸交普善山莊收殮、繩子一根、交本院贓物庫、</p>

<h3>押當公所請求同等待遇</h3>

<p>律、從未有所歧視、近閱十月六日申新報載、工部局消息、由財務處與典業公會接洽、將現行之執照捐費、减徵爲大典當營業額每年收千分之二、小典當每年收千分之四、此議經十月三日董事會核准、卽自一九三四年一月一日起實行等語、敝同業聞此消息、甚爲惶悚、因質押之資本、旣不如大典之雄厚、其在營業上所處之地位、本不能與大典當相提並論、其所以能與大典當爭一日之短長者、惟恃捐稅相同、而質押業之營業又極遷就而已、若竟改訂捐率相差至於一倍、則今後質押業因不能與大典當同受平等之待遇而歸於淘汰、勢有必然、（中略）素仰貴會爲租界市民之喉舌、對於界内行政顯失公允、或足以妨害公衆之利益者、均能仗義執言、以劑其平、（下略）請將减徵大典當執照捐之决議、仍與小典當徵收捐率同等待遇、以免因歧視而使兩業之間發生重大誤會、曷勝翹企盼感之至云、</p>

<p>春秋窮不得　  茸餘　　窮是人人厭懇的，「窮鬼」二字，一加上身，十人見了九搖頭，任你面如宋玉；任你學富五車，總没有人來親近你，人眞是窮不得！「君子固窮，小人窮斯濫矣！」這是孔老先生騙人的話兒，他自己吃喝得這樣講究，—見論話鄉黨篤—若是一個安貧耐苦的人兒？倒是他令高徒顔回，　食瓢飲；居陋巷·眞是一個十足的窮漢。可是他到底短命而死，可惜當時没有報紙：也没有人查考他爲甚麽而死，說不定也閙着「經濟壓迫，服毒自盡」的一齣把戲咧！　　「文起八代之衰」的韓昌黎，他做的原道一「諫迎佛骨表」，何等的風骨凛然，像煞有介事。可是他見窮也怕，所以結柳作車；縛草爲船；載糗與粻，三揖窮鬼而送之—見韓愈所作的送窮文—他又肯拍死人的馬屁，夫人拚命做墓志碑銘等文，以求多金。這可見古來有名的文學家，見了窮字，尙且愁眉蹙額，避之不遑，何况我們日處窮鄉的窮小子呢？　　越是窮人，飯量越好。富家擺滿了山珍海味，尙且不能下咽。窗人喝着薄粥；咬着菜根，倒覺得津津有味。不過逢着了糧盡袋空，聞着鄰家的飯香，也管敎你涎垂三尺。大人還可緊緊褲帶；咬咬牙根，爭一些窮氣。小孩子眞耐不住了，哭着吵着要飯吃，這時你熬得信嗎？隨園詩話中載有幾首窮詩，不妨鈔在下面：　　一雨昏陋巷燈無燄，風過貧家壁有聲。偶聞詩　吟懷减，偏遇荒年飯量加。」　　「可憐最是牽衣女，哭說鄰家午飯香。」　　上邊所說的遠是窮人自己的難過。走向人前更要受世谷百般的椰揄。譬如某家失了竊，首受嫌疑的總是窮朋友。某人做了官，窮親戚總嘗閉門羹。所以俗有幾句詩道：「大窮常恐人防賊。」又「無財休上顯親門。」眞是一些也不差！　　古人嘗透貧窮滋味，而他是足以出出窮氣的，要算蘇季子了。他從秦國落魄回來，妻不下紉；嫂不爲炊；父母不至言，何等的冷待他。等到取了卿相印回來，父母郊迎三十里，妻側目以視，側耳而聽；嫂匍匐膝行而前，又是一副面目了。所以季子嘆息道：「貧窮則父母不子；富貴則親戚畏懼，人生世上，勢位富厚，蓋可以忽乎哉！」　　唉丨古風純厚，尙且窮不得，何况今世？狗眼與人眼  馮摩尼　　吾人常常容易瞧見的事，在街頭巷尾的垃圾堆上，總有幾個身上襤褸的乞丐在找東西，故名之曰：「摘布頭敎化。」他們因爲没法，所以走上這人所不屑爲的路上去，縱使拾得幾個香烟罐頭，破布頭，也可以賣幾個錢來維持他的生活。假使徼天之幸，拾得花花鈔票，飛來横財，未始没有的事。　　在垃圾堆上找生活，已是苦極不堪。却還有狗來欺侮他，一看見他們蹲在垃圾堆上，就要汪汪亂吠，甚至跳上跳下的咬他。爲什麽狗不向那路上行人狂吠亂咬，偏偏向那乞丐施行它的狗威，眞是難以明白。由此觀之，狗雖畜牲，兩顆眼珠却是生得不凡，並能分上等人下等人之别。所以「狗眼看人低」這句話，確是不錯。　　狗也生有勢利的性情，人爲萬物之靈，自然比了狗還勝上一籌，只要舉目一瞧，貧富二字分得清清楚楚，對於富人當然百般趨奉，對於窮人，却像煞有介事的放出大老官面孔來指摘某人窮困，某人典衣度日的論調。如是見了更窮一些的人，瞧都不瞧，在他眼裏簡直没有這一種人。認爲看了要失落自己的身份，生怕染着窮氣。實在呢？各吃各的飯，絶對没有關係的。　　狗尙且看不起乞丐，人當然比狗更勢利了，富人對於窮人，姑不必說；因爲他靠着一個富字，可以壓倒一切。但有一種人，自己也很貧窮，偏要指摘别人，却忘記本來面目。我們蘇州有句俗話，所謂「敎化子曣弗落討飯的。」像這等人，在社會上數見不鮮。　狗，人，各生耳目口鼻，皆知饑食渴飯，無異於人。不過狗不會說話，不通智識，形式不同而已。然現在的人類，何以生上了狗眼，或許受了一種特殊的感化吧！仰起𩓐子  徐小庭　　敵機飛翔天空，小百姓仰起𩓐子看望，一不得勁，有性命交闢的危險。　　佃戶向田主交租，因年歲不好請求减少，田主若是仰起𩓐子作獰笑狀，佃戶准曉得不能允許自己的請求。　　窮朋友對富人談話，若是含有借貸的意思，會引起富人仰起𩓐子假看天空，這時窮人錢不但借不到，還要受富人的冷眼相待。　　大商店到了晚間，電炬通明，行路的人在不知不覺中，會仰起𩓐子張望，這是受了陳列的貨品和裝璜美麗的催眼作用。　　兩性戀愛在接吻的時候，被吻的一方面，每每會毫無機械的仰起𩓐子承受對�方的賜予，這是被吻者一種應有的義務　　天文家一到晚間，站在天文台上仰起𩓐子遙望，他們不是在台上閒眺，是爲研究天文學的進步。東北四連長　  張恨水　　第十八回　脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婿怱怱出塞强笑别家人　　可是他雖没有這個感覺，那位丈母娘江氏，他可留心了。已經由後面追了出來，走進屋來問道：揍了什麽了？這棧響一下。趙自强笑道：什麽也没有楱，剛才貓由窗戶眼裏鑽了出去，大概把窗戶台上一隻破碗碰到地上去了。江氏聽他說得如此的自然，也就不追問了。於是趙自强坐下來，江氏也坐下來，桂枝也走到門邊那張方凳子上坐下了。趙自强到了這時很感到無聊，就輕輕的咳嗽了兩聲。他這種咳嗽聲，似乎能夠傳染，立刻江氏也就咳嗽了兩聲。桂枝看到彼此都有些搭訕的樣子，這却不好意思自己也跟着咳嗽起來，這就笑道：别在家裏坐了，你老遠的回來，也去吃些點心去。江氏也就揷言道：對了，你應當和我們桂枝到乳茶館裏去坐着談談。這就像自己姊妹一樣，要什麽緊，還有些害臊啦。桂枝微微的瞪了他母親一眼道：你是好話不會好說。江氏道：得啦，我不是說了嗎？你們自個兒去談談嗎？别的我也就不說了。說着咳嗽了兩聲，又伸着頭到門外去看看太陽。趙自强也感到老在這裏坐着，未免也是越閙越僵於是就站起來笑了一笑道：我正是肚子餓了，你也去吃一點吧？說着話時，就把手上揑了的帽子，向頭上蓋着。走到門邊，手扶了推門的轉紐，臉却是向了桂枝望着，這在他，本是就要桂枝同走的意思，桂枝却也很了解，不等他說第二句話，在桌子抽屜裏，找出粉撲來，搶着在臉上撲了兩遍粉，搶着把一條白綢手絹掖在脅下，就笑着向江氏點了幾點頭道：媽，我一會兒就回來。只有他這一句話，那巳經表示他願意跟着趙自强走的了。（二三三）一個黃昏  傳翼之　　那是一個黃昏丨一個愁雲密佈雨後凄淸的黃昏。　　我像脫離了鐵柵的覊絆初回到山中的猴子，茫無歸宿似的跑進了一個公園丨法國公園，不，顧家宅花園，愛國朋友曾經替我這樣改正呼喚的錯誤。　　過去在這兒所得到的印象，是：中國娘姨推着法國小孩坐的臥車在草地上走；國附兒童戰爭中的中國小孩給雄糾糾的外國小孩打敗，拖着鼻涕逃跑到遠遠的地方喊「外國赤老」；一家大小團坐在草地的長凳上閒談或吵嘴；兩情繾綣的愛侶在叢林密葉下，假山茅亭中捉對兒喁喁私語······總之，這里充滿了給予人們快感的蓬勃的生機。　　這回是怎樣呢？婆娑而參差的樹林，隱藏在黑沉沉的夜霧中：疎星般的幾盞電燈，射出淡紅而微弱的亮光，懶洋洋地給予遊人們以指示迷路的一點光明丨這兒聞不着撲鼻的桂花香，寒蟲似乎給秋雨的暴力征服了，也忍住了它的唧唧的低泣聲；替天行刑的秋風，許是疲於奔命，聽不到蕭蕭落木；只有從園外經過的汽車嗚嗚的喇叭和園裏潺潺的噴泉遠近相應的共鳴；整個的公園，髣髴家遭横而主人失勢的權門，陡時冷落下來，不復使人留戀了。　　然而，人跡稀少的塲合，風雨晦明的晨夕，往往潛　着許多人　的悲哀，在裏我却聽得斷斷續續如怨如訴的尖銳而低微的哭聲，但感到哭聲震處的附近，却又寂然不聞了；只見叢林下兩個模糊的陰影；像是爲生存而拍賣自己的肉體的異性，若即若離地尾隨那黄　服長統革靴的法國兵，大概伊已尋得主顧而又想避免耳目，以顧全他們的體面吧！　　短草，怪石，都在倦睡的狀態中，只間或聞得跫然的足音，這是多麽陰慘而可怕！　　秋，本是個極藝術的季節；但，天高氣爽的睛晝我不來，晶瑩皎潔的月夜我又不來：這回有機會來了，恰又是個愁雲密佈，雨後凄清的黄昏，我不幸極了！世界珍聞巴黎女人的兩隻手膀　　巴黎女人是世界上第一會時髦的，這不必我代伊們吹，中國人也知道的。何况中國女人的時髦　跟着學巴黎；豈止中國，紐約，倫敦何嘗不是一樣，新衣服的樣子固不說了。但伊們最時髦丨摩智丨的都是賭誰的兩隻手膀黑。西洋人的美原是健康美，而記以合適的衣服，合適的顔色，所以伊們每個女人都是很婀娜的。到　期呢，那些巴黎女人都跑到鄉下去了，到海濱或到深林，伊們至少也要留幾天，有的留在鄉下一個月，天氣雖熱得厲害，但伊們也要出去散步，所穿的衣服都是没有袖子的，所以不上幾天就把臉晒成黄色，兩隻手膀就晒成微黑色了，到了這地步伊們就很滿意的回到巴黎來，大家見了不但不討厭，而且都說：你看伊那隻手膀多黑，定是避了暑纔回來呢！淹死鬼在法國　　因爲天天游泳，就想起一些兒時往事，尤其是前天馬萊河淹死了一個靑年以後。前天晚上七點，大家都回去吃飯去了，一位十九歲的靑年跑去游泳。他自己本不懂游泳，而又跑到深的地方，所以一下水半點鐘都没有起來，經岸上同伴發覺了，於是開始打撈，一直到夜半没有着落，第一個印象我是爲那個不幸的靑年哀憐，第二件事我想明天恐怕没有人游泳了。託得我兒時，我家鄉有一個人去洗澡淹死了，從此那塘都荒廢了，那原是大家無知相信有鬼的緣故，鬼的印象太深，我以爲歐州人也會相信有鬼的，大家怕不敢去游泳了。但事實却大不然，第二天游泳的人一樣的多，雖然屍首還没有撈起來，那時我聽見許多女人的議論，伊們有的說；他不知道游泳，所以淹死了，丨有的說恐怕還有别的緣因，因爲這孩子是在作工，又是一個孤兒，怕是主人待他不好而他氣得去投水了，有的說恐怕是爲情罷······伊們的推論都是合於科學而合理，絶没有提到一個鬼字。所以淹死鬼在法國没有威力，游泳的每天依然的游泳，大人帶着小孩，老太太，老公公（我看見一個老頭兒已經六十歲歲了，他游泳很好，有一個小孩才一歲半也去游泳）那淹死的人於他們心中只有爲之哀憐而並無一點恐懼。法國人與中國人的處世習慣　　說起來，我是很相信何朶連君的話；（註）法國人多誠實，中國人多虚僞。以處世來說，普通法國人是不管閑事的，但是，我所謂閑事是像有許多中國人那種時常無理取閙。他們對於他們的懂利與義務分得很清楚，小王你到電影院去看戲，你買票也得排隊，如你爭前去，衆人馬上攻擊你，駡你没有這「權利」。普通我們中國人最講究的是客氣，可是法國人就是不講客氣的，比如他向你說「你很好」，你就該回答「是的」，假如你說「你不好」，他們就當你眞的不好了，丨中國最講究的虚僞是敷衍，好故意說不好丨丨你如果向他說一聲「謝謝」，他回答你常常是「是的」，以我們中國人看來「多麽不客氣」，其是法國人却以爲應該說是的，這是表示他很高興接受你的話，中國人吃東西，最愛爭付錢，所以一個酒館裏只看見八個人吃飯撑出十六隻手。當茶房的不知如何是好，法國人就是最好的朋友同喝咖啡也是各付各的，但事先申明請客，那位朋友絶對不會從腰包中　出幾文來，做做樣子丨丨中國人最會做做樣子丨丨法國人，你如果侮辱了他，他是無論如何都得和你幹的，但是，你自己馬上發覺了你的錯誤，你向他請求原諒，他馬上和你握手原諒你了。中國人大致都像阿Ｑ，對敵人大致是看對方强不强，强則屈服，弱則雖别人哀憐亦不放手，中法兩國人處世習遦不同的地方太多，這不過略舉數端，常易發見的罷了。（朱梅自法國寄）</p>

<p>自由談反鄒  元良　　關於「莊子與文選」的議論，有些刋物上早不直接提起應否大家研究的問題，却拉到别的事情上去了。他們是在嘲笑那些反對「文選」的人們自己却曾做古文，看古書。　　這眞利害。大約就是所謂「以子之矛，攻子之盾一罷丨丨對不起，「古書」又來子！　　不進過牢獄的那裏知道牢獄的眞相。跟着闊人，或者自己原是闊人，先打電話，然後再去參觀的，他只看見獄卒非常和氣、犯人還可以用英語自由的談話。倘要知道得詳細，那他一定是先前的獄卒。或者是釋放的犯人。自然，他還有惡習，但他敎人不要鑽進牢獄去的忠告，却比什麽名人說模範監獄的敎育衛生，如何完備，比窮人的家裏好得多等類的話，更其可信的。　　然而自已沾了牢獄氣，據說就不能說牢獄壞，獄卒或囚犯，都是壞人，壞人就不能有好話。只有好人說牢獄好，這才是好話。讀過「文選」而說牠無用，不如不讀「文選」而說牠有用的可聽。反「反文選」的諸君子，自然多是讀過的了，但未讀的也有，舉一個例在這裏罷丨丨「莊子我四年前雖曾讀過，但那時還不能完全讀懂·······文選則我完全没有見過，」然而他結末，「爲了浴盤的水糟了，就連小寳寳也要倒掉，這意思是我們不敢讚同的。」他要保護水中的「小寳寳，」可是没有見過「浴盤的水」。　　五四運動的時候，保護文言者是說做白話文的都會做文言文，所以古文也得讀。現在保護古書者說反對古書的也在看古書，做文言，丨丨可見主張的可笑。永遠反芻，自己却不會嘔吐，大約眞是讀透了「莊子」了。秋之晨  謝冰瑩　　大約是五點鐘的時候我被一陣犬吠聲驚醒，再也睡不着了。　淡淡的月光射在我的房子裏，映出水銀一般的世界，天空是淺藍的，没有星星，（也許有，但是睜開着朦朧眼睛的我没有看到而巳），奇怪，勞働者的號音和每次打開奶睛就看見牠向我點頭的綠樹忽然没有了，這時我才猛然地意識到我已搬家。　　這是一所新建的三樓宿舍，從工友們開始打地基起，一直到整個的樓房完功上，牠都親眼看到他們二十餘個男女工作，每天五點鐘的時候，他們就起來，搬的搬磚，砍的砍木頭，鋸的鋸板，小伙計燒柴火煑稀飯······各種各樣的聲音都起了，有時我因爲改卷子晚上睡的太晚，或者因了失眼剛剛在四點鐘左右閉上眼睛，不一會又被他們吵醒了，心裏有點埋怨他們起的太早，但一想到他們是在幹一件偉大的工程，自己反而慚愧起來。　　他們的生活是苦到再不能苦的地步了！早晨小伙計燒好了稀飯後八個人有時、九個或者十個人都圍在我房子旁邊的地上晞哩哈囉地吃着，他們下稀飯的只有半小碗生了霉，用鹽炒過的黄豆子。午飯是乾飯，但也爛得和乾稀飯一般，菜是用提水用的洋鐵桶盛着，我親眼看見過五六次，他們每次吃的都是粉條燒豆腐，有時還加雜些酸菜，湯很多。有一天我去查寢室，他們忽然在二樓的新房子裏吃飯了，我很替他們高興，我覺得費了他們三個多月的苦心苦力建築成的房屋一定要給他們住些時才對。「Ｊa　boun　mo·」（譯音，吃飯了没有？）其中有一位微美着問我。「mo」（没有）　　我也笑了一笑，想要多說一句什麽話，但是說不出來，因爲他們只懂厦門話。我被一種好奇心驅使，連忙走近他們的鐵桶旁邊用勺子掬起熱氣騰的菜來看，天，又是一桶水，不，現在應該說桶湯了。裏面的菜仍然是頭腐和酸菜，但加了猪血和幾塊大肥肉。我很想告訴他們爲什麽不湯菜分開來煑，但隨即自己心裏打了一下嘴吧，「分開煑？他們那裏有時間？那裏有碗盛菜？那裏像你們一樣。肉裏還要放味精？「不好吃，」他們用厦門話說着。　　「眞艱苦！」　　我只能慘然地說出這三個字來。　　「是啦，」這是他們全體的回答。　　這時我像啞子一般走下樓了。　　雖然我是怎樣尊敬他們，喜歡和他們接近，但是從清晨到晚上的喧閙聲，我總討厭，因爲我太不能做事了，不但在白天不能寫文章改卷子，即使翻一下書，也被外面的聲音閙的頭痛，因此我天天想搬家，想了一個多月一直到昨天下午才達到目的。　　醒來了，我感到一種寂寞凄凉的悲哀，工友們砍木頭，搬磚頭，鋸木板，釘木頭······小伙計燒柴的種種聲音都没有了，只遠遠地聽到一聲聲鷄啼聲，犬吠聲。　　風，靜止了，有五扇窗戶部打開的，但一絲凉意也没有，天空漸漸地由淺蓋變成淺灰，由淺灰變成魚肚色了。　　我在回憶着過去的創傷，心頭像有一塊巨石壓着我不能呼吸，我感到一種莫明其妙的煩悶。　　「不該搬來的，爲什麽在那邊我每天打開眼睛就起身，心裏很輕快，到這裏來第一天就這樣受苦，這究竟是什麽原故呢」現在我自己埋怨自己了。　　從熱烘烘的被窩裏爬起來站在窗前望到一座座的紅，黄，藍，白的洋樓，想到睡在洋樓裏面的那些男男女女這時還沉醉在甜美的睡鄉裏，但像牛馬一般爲他們終年勞働的工人們已開始工作了丨　　呆呆地站着，望着，一直到望到了無數的血紅的針向我的眼眼一齊射來，我才猛然地想起，時候不早了，到了我工作的時間。　　什麽煩悶都没有了，太陽，只有太陽能温暖我冰冷的心，能燃燒起我熊熊的火焰！白果呌賣者  曰生　　一到秋天，雨就怪討厭的下，下······買白果的老王，抬頭看了看天，已進黄昏時候，自己嘆息了一聲，挑着擔子到馬路上去了。　　他跑過了好幾條馬路，穿過了好幾條衖道，電燈都亮了，雨並没有停，他的生意經也同這天氣一樣，使人發愁！　　雨漸漸地下大了，馬路變成一條發白光的河流，老王在這時，將擔子放在一個衖道的門口，前面的一隻，有個烏黑的小鍋，放在狗舌頭似的火上面燒着，燒着。後面的一隻，上面鋪了一塊破油布，下面深深地埋着一個藍布口袋，那裏面裝着燒好的白果。　　老王機械的—不，他純熟的將鐵鍋裏的黑破白果，上下左右的炒着，於是，敲着鍋沿，發出一　「ta-ta」的聲音，又尖銳，又嘈雜。他也張開喉頭，唱着那麽清脆，凄凉的呌賣聲；　　脆手糯米—熱白果，　　香又香來—糯又糯。　　一個銅板買六—顆，　　明朝就要買四—顆。　　他一遍兩遍的唱着，在這凄風苦雨中；使衖道裏的空氣更爲蕭殺，慘淡······那種凄凉的味兒，向着敏感的人們心裏鑽，使他們起一種無名的傷感，悲怨，道就是「秋思」呀！　　香又香來—糯又糯—　　阿弟買幾個板？　　兩個板　　老王從破油布下面，取出藍色的口袋，　口裏停了唱，數着一，二，三，······　　呌阿弟的那個小孩子，手裏捧滿温熱的白果，口裏流着涎，驕傲的望着旁邊的人，他低下頭去，噙了一顆白果，隨即發出「拍」的一聲。　　老王聽見那一聲，心裏好像針扎子一一，他惡狠狠地望着買白果的孩子，他媽的，一個銅板六顆，賣白果也一年不如一年了。但是丨他又唱着；　　一個銅板買六丨顆二·三　　老王這一次呌得更凄厲，悲憤。　這種天氣，加上這種聲音，比宋玉的悲秋賦還要動人，充實。　　每到秋天，老王都要唱「燙手糯米熱白果」的老調，他是一年一年的消瘦了，老了，他在都市裏代替了「落葉」，代替了「明月」，向人預示着殘酷的嚴冬將要到來丨但是，他是爲着生活的掙扎，無意中宣示罷了。　　燙手糯米—熱白果，　　香又香來—糯又糯—　　··············　　老王又在唱了。編輯室　　追風，梁園東，唐弢，黑嬰，李平，菊生，元奕諸先生：請將最近通訊處示知。兩兄弟（二十一）  莫泊桑著李維克譯　　老頭兒　有了一個主意：　　「你剛才說牠像美麗的紅寳石，這句話很好，很好；我們就呌牠「美麗的紅寳石」罷。」這名詞雖是醫生自己發明的，但他仍舊說不很妥當，他要他簡單單地呌作「」覆盆子酒」，瑪洛斯科說是好極了。隨後他們便住了嘴坐在那唯一的煤氣燈下，幾分鐘一句話都没有說。結局，筆爾終於不由自主地說道：　　「眞的，今晚我們家事發生了一宗頗爲奇怪的事情呢。我父親的一個朋友，臨死的時候把他的財産留贈給我的弟弟了。」　　藥劑師好像没有卽刻懂得這話的意思似的，可是想了一下，他以爲醫生也得了一半，當筆爾把這事情詳細解釋給他聽了之後，他像吃了一驚並且生氣了；爲着表示他對於他的靑年友人被犧牲了的不滿，他再三說：　　「這事不會有好結果的。」　　又變得萎靡起來了的筆爾，想要知道瑪洛斯科這話的意思。丨丨爲什麽這事不會有好結果呢？他的弟弟繼承了一個和他們家裡交情的朋友的財産，這事能夠發生什麽壞結果呢？可是那謹愼的老實漢子不肯再解釋下去。　　「在這樣的情况中，是應當同樣贈給兄弟兩人的，我對你說這事不會有好結果的。」醫生焦燥起來，轉身跑了，他回到家裏睡下了。在睡下不久的時候，他聽到哲安在隔壁房襄輕輕走着；隨後，喝了兩杯水，他便睡熟了。　　　三　　醫生第二天醒來决定想法子致富。　　他從前已經好幾次有過這樣的主意，都不曾繼續去使它實現。他每次試換一種新的行當時，起初總是那能夠早日發財的希望支持着他的氣力和信念，直到遇着第一個障碍爲止，直到遇着那把他抛在一條新的路上的第一個失敗爲止。　　他這時沉在牀裡，睡在暖和的被褥中細想着。多少醫生不久便成了百萬富翁喲！這祇要稍許用點心思就行了，因爲他在學校裡研究醫學的時候曾有機會和那些最著名的敎授接觸，而在他眼中，他們不過是一些蠢驢罷了。確實的。他雖然不比他們强，至少也不比他們弱。倘使他能夠用一個什麽法子獲得哈佛爾那批高貴而又富足的主顧，他每年可以狠窜易的嵰得十萬佛郎。於是他以一種正確的方法計算着他的收益。早上他可以出門，他可以到他的病人家裡去。少算點，平均每早看十個病人，每個病人診費二十佛郎，每年至少可以得到七萬二千佛郎，或者還可增至七萬五千佛郎，因爲實際上將來每早决不止看十個病人的。下午他可以在他的診所裏接看病人，平均每天也算十個人，每人診費十佛郎，一年便可得到三萬六千佛郞。這樣算來，每年便整整有十二萬佛郎的收入了。那些出診祗取十佛郎，門診祗取五佛郎的老主顧和熟朋友，也許會使得這總數略爲减少一點，但這事是可以和别的醫生邀他合診及一切醫業上通行的小收益相抵的。　　要做到上面說的這地步，那是毫没有什麽困難的，祇須用着巧妙的廣告，在「惠加羅」報上發表些消息，說是巴黎科學界都注意着他，對於這年靑而又質樸的哈佛爾學者所担任的一些驚人的治療狠感興味等等。這樣他便會比他的兄弟更闊，更闊且更著名，而他便會滿意他自己，因爲他的財産是憑他自已的力量掙來的啊；到那時他便會對於他的父母顯得狠慷慨，而他們也會因爲他的名聲盛着驕傲。他那時不會結婚，他不願以一個單調的累人的女人來壅塞他的生活，但他會在他的顧客裡面挑選一些最漂亮的女人來做他的情婦。　　他對於他的成功覺得那樣有把握，竟像立刻要把它抓住似的，霍地跳下了牀，他穿上衣服好到市上去找那適於他開業的房子。</p>

<p>談言虚榮心  際雲　　「虚榮心」三個字。是人類的勁敵。一切的罪惡。都由它造成。都市人們的虚榮心。比諸鄉村的格外濃厚。所以作好犯科的。也較鄉村中多出不知幾倍。鄉下人穿的是布衣。吃的是菜飯。我行我素。我守我貧。物質上的慾望是淡薄的。用不着處心積慮地謀「虚」的尊「榮」。城内人的生産能力。不見行高明。然而自以爲是優秀分子。恐怕旁人不注意他。或則看輕他。所以一切務求講究。藉向他人示威。力之所及者。還能勉强地不露馬脚。外强中乾者。立刻會去造罪惡。我想牢獄裏的人。什九經過「虚榮心」的烟幕彈籠罩過的。　　進而言之。凡是怕人不注意。怕人看輕他。一切狠幼稚的觀念。都是因人而起的。丨是被動的。　　堂子裏的姑娘。淡妝濃抺。爭奇鬥勝。求得「客人」的歡心。這是被動的。交際花打扮得花枝招展。巧言令色。做大人物的娱樂品。開口某部長。閉口某處長。這也是被動的。坐了黑照會的汽車。在南京路上駛過。兩隻眼不止地向兩邊人行道上亂張。希望着熟人看見。表示着他的闊。這也是被動。假使没有「客人」。没有大人物。没有人行道的人他們也决不有什麽「　榮」和實榮的。　　提倡體育。鍜練身體。目的是强種强國。决不是專求毫無實際價值的錦標的。祗要能夠跑萬米。就證明自己的運動技能。已臻佳境了。第一第二。有事實來表白。何必生無謂的爭執呢。這種爭執。也是一種虚榮心的産物、假使一個人單獨地跑。或則跑道的四圍。没有看熱閙的觀衆。决没有爭端的。所以這種「虚榮心」。也是絶對的被動的。　　有能力做好商。已不憂吃不慮着了。他們運劣貨。販劣米。唯一的目的是賺錢。是求物質上逾分的舒適。是拿富有來向旁人示威。誰都不能否認爲「虚榮心」。爲旁人而産生的「虚榮心」。　　「一將功成萬骨枯」。靑史留名。萬世流芳。這種離了生活上必需的條件之外的收穫。何莫非被動的「虚榮」。　　總之求榮而得之榮。名之「虚榮」。决無持久性的。大家明白了眞實的人生觀。天下就此少是非。老黑  小工　　老黑在我們學校裏說起來，總要算得上是一個聞人，不，不祗是算得上是一個聞人，並且還要算得是一個要人了。　　他呌老黑，那是實在的，我們只要看見他的臉，那怕是一個陌生的，也會立時就知道他的綽號。　　他那正個的臉上並不是像黑皮鞋那麽黑得簡單，雀班，在鼻子的左右，點綴得是十分好看，還有那兩個大黄牙，是嘴唇包不上的。　　爲了上學期考試的成績優異，所以這學期便榮膺了學生會的會長。　　以地位和學問來說，他是很夠得上交一兩個女朋友，或者交一兩個「甜心的。那末，他便開始着追求。雖然，在同學們的面前，他仍是永遠，時時保持着會長的尊嚴。　　追求，追求，哈哈，他看中了全校聞名的花小姐，那是有名的帶着剌的玫瑰花。同學們都暗暗的替我們的老黑揑了一把汗。　　其實，老黑未嘗不自知其所以爲老黑，但是他說：「人不可以貌相。以貎[丨&gt;生產過剩　士英&lt;丨]　　取人，是古今中外聖賢所不爲。」並且他還有一個譬喻，他說：　　「如果若有兩樣菜，一樣是臭豆渣，一樣是紅燒肉。臭豆渣盛在一個上等洋瓷碗裏；紅燒肉盛在一個破瓦罐裏。雖然一個外表好看，一個外表不好看。但是我們寗可在破瓦罐裏搶紅燒肉，而一在洋瓷碗裏爭臭豆渣。」　　於是，那玫瑰花的香氣之後，便常常隨了老黑的黑影。　　天作之合，那天老黑在敎室裏拾到一張玫瑰花的生物學的實騐報告，便急急忙的尋到了玫瑰花的香踪。　　「密司，······密司花，這是······這是在敎室裏的。」老黑漲紅了臉。　　「啞，是的，謝謝你，密司特何」。玫瑰花向花黑來了一個千金難買的撕扇子。　　老黑就覺得身不由己。　　他想：這是千載難逢，不可失之交臂，大丈夫必須敢作敢爲，寫信，寫信，一定寫信！　　第一封情書，請她看影戲，老黑帶着筆到飯廳裏去寫。　　頭一張紙，那是好像比賽百米的預賽，不算的，第二張，不好，第三張也不好，最後，老黑想出了一個法子；决定用球類比賽的淘汰法，選出了一張冠軍。便急急的呌校役送到女生宿舍。　　但是這到底是出乎意料之外，那玫瑰花的覆信畢竟是難得，老黑急得像熱鍋上的螞蟻。又羞之腦，不免暗暗呌苦。照老黑現在的資望，這確是使他難堪得不能容忍的事。　　却好，圖書館門前逢見了玫瑰花，笑。　　「密司特何，眞是對不起，星期日我没有工夫。」　　「嘿嘿：：：那末算了吧：：：」　　玫瑰花一只手撩起妃色的長袍，一跳一跳的上了圖書館的石階。　　老黑一想，算了吧。　　星期日早上，老黑親眼望見地質系的大塊頭助敎同了他的「甜心」並着肩走上公共汽車。　　「啊喲，不好。」老黑一急，那正是妃色的長袍。　　玫瑰花回頭一看，映在老黑眸子裏的是那兩個肥圓的笑　。現代名人書畫　　黄寳虹先生山水（略歷見前）</p>

<p>病院日記  環　　二十六日　　爲了脚上生一個瘡疽，今天我住到這三等病房中來了。　　全房病人都是苦痛的呻吟着，充滿了窮苦和凄凉。　　我生平最怕住醫院，何况這三等病房又是如此簡陋，隘小的房屋，灰暗的窗房，眞夠令人氣窒，但是爲了貧，爲了病，又有什麽辦法呢？　　醫生說明天馬上可以行手術，開刀後住幾天便可出院，我眞喜。可是我也害怕，我想那一定是非常疼痛的呵。　　　二十七日　　終於開刀了，簡直痛得要命。　　從昨天起，我便留心這房中的每一病人，她們都是痛苦的表情，只有我對面的那一位小姐却老是那末歡悅，那末嬌媚。他有一只小的圓鏡，不時照着塗着脂粉，畫着長眉，其餘的時痱便是讀着張資平的「愛力圈外」和張衣萍的「情書一束」可是她也讀過柯侖泰的「三代纞愛」這是她在一位看護面前矜誇過的。呣，她是一個美麗的姑娘，她是一個幸福的女兒。　　隔壁床上的女人告訴我：「她來了很久，每天吃一隻鷄和一斤牛肉」我想這該使這裏每個病人的妒嫉了。　　二十八日　　　對　的一個跌斷了手的女小學生　　的手　得太緊，要求醫生替她扎鬆些，可是醫生並没有允許她，只是笑嘻嘻的走到幸福的女兒床邊坐下。這時她嬌着聲音說：　　「Ｘ醫生，不知道怎樣的，我的膀胱有點兒痛。」　　　「呵丨讓我看。」　　於是四圍的帳子拉攏，帳中只有她和醫生兩人。許久，靑年Ｘ醫生的臉上泛着得意的笑容，從帳中出來，柔和的說：　　「没有關係，回頭用熱水袋温温就會好的。」女人没有回答，接上是這醫生親自爲她放好熱水袋，親自爲她蓋好被頭。我想當時那女人一定心跳，我眞相大笑起來。　　　二十九日　　昨晚一夜没的好睡，眞是氣死丨因爲那年靑的醫生在那美麗的女人床邊唧唧噥噥的談了半夜，誰也聽不出到底在說些什麽，結果使全房的病人都興奮起來，誰也睡不着，甚至於有意的哈哈大笑。當時我眞氣急不過，我膽大的向Ｘ鹥生嘻笑着說：　　「Ｘ醫生，你們談着什麽故事，難道不能大家聽聽的嗎？」　　「没有什麽，不過是問問她的病狀罷了。」　　不久Ｘ醫生臉上熱烘烘的走出去了。　　這是昨天的事。今天Ｘ醫生突然爲我簽字了，說是我可以回家休養。　　「好的我可以回家去，大家方便些。」我說。　　現在我預備回家了，不過，我懂得Ｘ醫生别有用意存在呵。戲劇印花稅（兩塲寳寫劇）  名逸　　第一塲　　時間：秋天的下午　　地點：中國南部某島上的商埠底一　　　　　家小理髮店裏　　人物：丨依出塲先後爲序　　　　警察Ａ　　　　理髮師　　　　理髮店主人　　　　巡察官　　　　警察ＢＣＤ及看閙熱的閑雜人　　　　等若干人　　景：一平常的理髮室内景，台左設　　　　置一大鏡，鏡前二三架座位，　　　　除開了中間一張坐着一位理髮　　　　將畢的顧客以外，其餘的全空　　　　着。台右有小門通内室。幕開　　　　時，一位理髮師正在替那位顧　　　　客洒香水，那位顧客很得意似　　　　地顧盼鏡子中間剃得光光的自　　　　己的頭，笑了一笑，他心裏或　　　　許是在盤算今晚還是到ＸＸ巷　　　　去，還是到ＸＸ園去這問題。理髮師　（很巴結似的）先生，可要生髮　　油？警Ａ　（被他一問突然醒了似的）唔唔　　。理髮師（因職業上的訓練，很懂得「唔　　唔的意義，於是取下紅瓶子在光頭上洒着，摩擦着，剛剃的頭立刻放出光輝來。在擦遇生髮油之後，理髮師不慌不忙地從小抽屜内拿出一張小的綠色方紙，輕輕地貼在光的頭上，然後整理圍布，表示他的任務已經完了）警Ａ（從椅上立起身來，這時觀衆　　才看見他是一位雄糾糾的穿着　　制服的警察老爺。他舒泰地整　　整衣領，等着理髮師把他的官　　帽子送　　　凖備不了要　　　　　頭，突然在鏡子裏瞧見自己頭　　上多一張東西，心裏有些憤慨　　立刻轉過身來）夥計十一理髮師（必恭必敬地把帽子拿過來）先　　　　生丨警Ａ他媽的丨（指着頭上）這是什麽　　　？理髮師（好像犯了罪似的，戰戰兢兢　　　　地審視警察的頭）先生，没有　　　　錯丨（突然想起來了，一轉過　　　　身從抽屜裏取出一支鉛筆來，　　　　打算在警察的頭去盡一下）呵　　　，忘記了······警Ａ（一隻熊掌飛過去）他媽的，你　　　，你你······理髮師（退一步，哀求地）先生，先生　　　　·······警Ａ　（更進一步，正欲舉拳，店主　　　　人慌忙跑出來）店主人先生，請不必動氣丨（攔住了　　　　警Ａ又轉身向理髮師（什麽事　　　　，阿二？警Ａ操你的妹子，跟老子開玩笑！理髮師我貼的是二分，並没有錯。店主人（也窑　警Ａ的頭，非常釋然）　　　　地）先生，是二分，地並没有　　　　弄錯（大　　你打官　　可以）　　　　的神氣）！警Ａ（這一下可大發雷霆了）豈有此　　　　理丨没有錯！（說没也暴一個　　　　耳光飛過店主人的臉，聲音清　　　　脆而嚮亮）。店主人（也不是一個弱者，順手就提　　　　着一件傢具向警Ａ身上投去，　　　　警躱過，復開始衝鋒，大有沙　　　　塲效死殺敵之愾，於是一場惡　　　　戰開始）。　　看熱閙的閑雜人等陸續登塲，他們很緊張的看着這兩位鬥士來回地激戰着，没有誰說一句話。一會兒，人叢中有人發出一聲：「巡警來了」丨這句話很生了一點兒力量，打的停止了，看的人也有些跑開，從人　裏擠進巡察官和警察ＢＣＤ。巡察官（取出日記薄來，向警Ａ）你呌　　　什麽名字？那一區的？警Ａ　（立正，敬禮）報告巡察官，我　　　　　呌張得勝，第Ｘ區第Ｘ分所警　　　　　士。巡蔡官（轉向店主人）你呌什麽名字？店主人　　我呌李雲發，一樂也理髮店的　　老閭。巡察官（向警Ｂ等）都帶回局裏去！）　　　　在拉拉扯批的當中，人們漸漸　　　　散去　　　　舞台暗轉（Ｄack　ChancＲe）　　　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>

<p>電影專刊好萊塢最可愛的一個小孩子　希佛萊「睡覺故事」中的配角　他的母親還是未成年的女子  茂德　　在希佛萊最近攝成的一張「睡覺故事」（A　Bedtime　Story）裏·有一個很可愛的小孩子他是大頭圓臉·大眼睛·小嘴，胖胖的身體。太可愛了，我們希望不久就可以看見他。他的名字呌勒樂温勃倫納（Ｂady　Le　Ｒoy　Weinbrenner）。自從派拉蒙公司尋着了這位小明星之後，好萊塢的各影片公司，大家都眼紅得很。他們都問：「這孩子那裏找到的」？　　說來眞奇怪得很。原是這孩子並不是找來的，是自已送上來的。他的母親是個十多歲的小寡歸。等到勒樂在肚子裏長大了，他的父親突然死了。於是這個伶仃孤苦的小孤婦，因爲一個錢没有，就跑到救世軍的一個救濟所去求救濟去了。救濟所把她收留了下來，不久就生下這個寗馨兒。這個孩子生下來的時候，就不像是個伶仃孤苦的母親所生的，非但體格强健，並且性情愉快。他日天生快樂的孩子。一天到晚嬉開了嘴笑，在救濟所裏無人不喜歡的。所以他母親生産之後，救濟的期限已滿，但是因爲那孩子太可愛了，而他的母親又孤苦無依，不忍把他們撮出去，就把他們留住了很久。　　等到派拉蒙公司要招尋小演員的時候，勒欒是頭一個來報名。希佛萊被公司派定了去選擇一個孩。他看見了勒樂就愛，而勒樂看見了他就笑。别的孩子亦有會笑的，但是没有像勒樂那樣有趣。並且奇怪得很，幾個月的孩子，就會啜了嘴，作口嘘狀。這使希佛萊大高興了，就有意選擇他作他的配角。　　但是公司方面爲愼重起見，竟在一千個小孩之中，檢了一百八十二個，並且一個一個，都經過一番鏡頭的試騐。結果没有一個比得上這個勒樂的，於是公司方面，就决定了那救世軍救濟所裏生的那個孩子了。但是公司方面爲這次選擇一個小演員，已經耗費了兩萬兩千塊美金。　　等到那張「睡覺故事」演好放映之後，美國的全國，都寫信給派拉蒙公司，要求使勒樂多演幾張片子。他們信裏，什麽形容詞多用到了。派拉蒙公司知道這個孩子確已轟動了全國，於是决决和他訂了一個七年的長期合同。但是他的母親，還不過十六歲，未到法定年齡，照例是不能簽訂合同的。後來由他的母親在她的同族中尋到了一位老年長者代子簽合同。至於到底多少錢一個月，或一個禮拜，公司方面，却没有宣布，大概亦不多吧。影片談評「林中怪俠」評“Ｍan　Of　the　Forest"  摩爾　　　　—新光—　　又是一張「西部」影片！不管聖葛萊的武俠小說，多少著名，不管繭杜爾史葛德，和哈利格萊，多少能召號，但是我們早知道「西部」影片的本身是没有多大意義的。　　武俠影片的産生，本來和武俠小說同樣是很據於社會上不安穩狀態的。譬如小市民因爲受盡了壓迫，没有辦法反抗復仇，而希望一個大俠客來代替他們反抗復仇，這種阿Ｑ式的思想，已經夠可憐了。倘若因爲旣成的社會制度，或則經濟組織，爲了法院警察。甚至劊子手的刀，所不能維持，而希望一個大俠客來維持，這種思想，那是尤其可笑了。　　不幸「林中怪俠」就是第二類的武俠片。葛其姆大牧場主的財産，因爲有「大俠」白萊脫的帮助，而歸還他的侄女愛里斯，而保持了傳統的「承繼」方法。同時，惡紳比斯里，因爲惡貫滿盈，在「善有善報，惡有惡報」的定律之下，爲一個所謂「弗太太」鎗殺了。自然理由是正大極的：丨丨「爲社會除害。」夠了，我們只要舉出這兩點，已經證明了我上邊的話了。現在我們且着導演手腕罷！　　Ｈenry在「林中怪俠」裡，是使盡了他的解數了，他不肯隨便的把故事叙述下去，他一定使故事有很多小波瀾，他寫一個人大失敗一定先寫他的小勝利，讓觀衆的神精緊張起來，然後再反過來使觀衆格外的安慰和痛快。　　此外，他留很多膠片來放騎擊戰鬥的故事。如此，則他要寫的，就可以充分寫出，而演員，也有機會表現他的長處。　　最後，他再運用很多笑料，使觀衆快樂，這當然不必要的，「但在西部」影片，觀衆已經不再要看的現在，不加些笑料，是很難得到歡迎的。　　自然因爲故事中馳驟的地方很多，所以鏡頭也不得不跟着變換而迅速。　　演員方面，男主角，因爲太注意於大動作，對於小的表情，不能不忽略一點，而女主角却很能夠表演騖恐的神情。「戀愛與奮鬥」評  糜蕪　　“Ｈold　Me　Tioht"　　——南京—　　我們總覺得電影與戲劇的不同，最大的地方，是在戲劇的佈景方面，多少有些象徵，而電影則不然。有演方面，舞台演員，無論如何，總須做作，一點，因爲不如此，不能使觀衆得到正確的觀感，而貫影首先就要自然。　　「戀愛與奮鬥」中，是没有十分大的大塲面。卽使正面的搏鬥等塲面，也很少。但它有一個長處，就是「自然」。　　首先導演者把這一個故事，很和平的展開着。中國舊文學中所謂，「閑閑說來」，就是没有矜奇誇巧的地方，而極自然，并且不使人感到沉悶。當然，像考爾門主演的「情幻」那樣的輕鬆巧妙，是没有的，但每一個對於電影藝術稍有研究者，就知道「變愛與奮鬥」，是有很多地方，值得注意的。　　演員，女主角是可以稱道的，他表演劇中人瑪蕾，留心奸滑的稽查員杜雷串通三四匪徒，有所舉動時，一方面故意泰然的工作着，不動聲色，一方面非常仔細的留意，這時候她常常迅速的看他，而觀衆們，只是知道好在注意，而不能很具體的說出好是怎樣的在法意來，我覺得她是成功的。　　此外，在劇情發展到將近高潮時，導演者能夠指揮演員，在各方面，給觀衆一個暗示的預感，使觀衆們差不多屏息面待。這自然編劇者，把握得住故事發展的脈絡，而導演演員，都有很大的關係的。　　在文學上所謂「氛圍」，卽是電影中所謂「空氣」但是很多人所注意的空氣只是現實的襯托。像賽馬片中的羣衆興奮鼓掌之類·事實上，「空氣」應該聯係在情感方面，「伏虎美人」結尾時，風吹沙漠，掃滅足跡等，不但深深的　入觀衆的感覺中，使他們凄然淚下，而沙漠的茫茫無際的景色，也使觀衆如伺親歷其地一樣。「戀愛與奮鬥」這種地方是没有做到的，這或則爲劇情所决定吧！外國片好的地方我們原該學習，不夠的地方，我們應該拿他做例而改革我們自已的缺點。　　最後，關於「變愛與奮鬥」的故事，是純粹美國片的典型，男女戀愛，有人破壞，終於克服了種種因難而享快樂生活，如此而已丨評「義士獲艶記」Ｍen　Without　Low　  凌鶴　　　—哥倫比亞出品　卡爾　　映—　　這一部武俠片中比較可說的，倒還是導演的方法。　　影片的開始，那一戰爭的場面，雖然僅僅是那末一點，可是戰場的恐怖，却充分緊張的表現出來。這時候，我受着畫面的剌激，在黑暗中我靜靜的想到影片的命題「法律以外的人們，」我想這一影片一定是富於反抗性的了。於此可以證明，那戰塲的恐怖，那醫院中的傷感，的確可以抓住觀衆的情感，不管它的力量仍是薄弱。　　整個片子的系統非常明晰，這可見導演對於分幕很是成功。姑勿論這是每一導演所必須具備的條件，然而我們就看過好些庸俗的歐美影片没有明確的系統。茲更就Ｍontage方面舉一例證。譬如勃克自戰地回家時：　　（全景）母親安閒的　花。　　（遠景）兒子走近家門的脚步聲。　　（中景）母親自窗外窺探，喜形於色。　　（全景）兒子走入栅門。　　（全景）母親注視房門，兒子入内。　　（中景）兒子見母親，母親熱情的起立。　　（中景）兒子走近母親，母親張臂以迎。　　（大寫）擁抱，接吻。　　當然這都是根平常的，不過也很合理。此外小聰明的地方也有很多，如當勃克和盜首格鬥時，孟女走出房門，看見手槍，即拾取，我們一定以爲她要殺盜首，而出人意料的只傷了另一窗口的盜徒，後威命勃克舉手。又如自烟囱中擲子彈至火爐中爆發，使匪徒驚亂，勢克以繩吊盜首下井。在危難中勃克被縛，而執意使劇情緊張。有了這許多精采的地方，自　劇的空氣是不會冷寂的了。　　關於Ｂock　Jones的演技，没有獨到之處。武功亦不見高强。然而總還算有些面部表情。　　至於這一影片的内容，我們可從一般的武俠片中來推測，不外乎是美人英雄懲暴除奸。有的是倡導刦富濟貧，但在這理却是英雄拯救了牧場主的女兒而與她好合。更巧妙的是題目的賣弄，所謂「法律以外的人們，」只是英雄帮助了法律的效能罷了。好萊塢畸形的保險  伏吾　　好萊塢又新添了一種保險法，使原有的各種奇形怪狀的保險，反覺謂平淡無奇了。最新的保險法，是綁票保險。聽說一般明星們投保的非常踴躍。但是有一種毛病；就是最高的保額，限止於五萬美金。這五萬美金，差不多是不足綁匪一盼的。可是因爲一個人被綁之後，無論贖欵多少，可以先向公司領取危險費五萬元，大家還覺得這五萬元，大可以拿來當作分期付欵的第一次付欵。所以大家投保的，還很踴躍。　　提到好萊塢畸形的保險法，現在可以證明的計有格羅利亞史璜生女士，替她賓客的衣服，保了十萬塊錢的險。凡到他家去的朋友，衣服弄破了，可以由保險公司賠償。騎馬大王湯密克斯曾經將他的身體，分作三部份，在三家公司分别保了三十萬元的險。計頭部一家公司：從頸項到腰部一個公司，臉部以下，又一個公司，鬥鷄眼彭託賓到現在還保了很大的眼險，他的眼險是倘便他的眼不鬥鷄了，公司裏就要賠償他的損失。小說電影盛筵難再Ｄinner　at　Eight（七）  馬騰　　派卡德和吉蒂一塲舌戰之後、派卡德很明顯地吃了敗仗，垂頭喪氣地離開了吉蒂的修妝室，回自己的屋子襄去了。吉蒂這次佔了上風，微笑地看著她桌上小的座。鐘時間已是不早，八點差一刻。這個時候，勞萊雷瑙德一個人在他的房間襄。他忽然看看他的手腕，但是手表已不在了。當了去了。什麽都進了長生庫了。他打了一個電話到賬房間衷，才知道是八點差一刻。他的代理人馬克斯已經去了兩個鐘頭還没有回來，可是一瓶白蘭地酒已經銷光了。他的禮服已經穿好了，預備到番敦的宴會去的，不過爲什麽馬克斯還不回來呢。丨難道他亦離棄他了嗎。　　勞萊雷瑙德所希望能恢復他聲望的一張影片，因爲經理博門突然間病了，他必須要到福羅利達海濱去養病去，所以他就將那張片子，賣給另我一位呌史登吉爾的製片家了。這位史登吉爾自己有一個英國演員，可以做那片子的主角。剩下的還有一個小角色。要是勞萊願意的話，他就可以去當那小角色。當然盛名之下的雷瑙德是萬萬不肯的，可是經遇馬克斯的連騙帶勸，雷瑙德處於王孫末踏的地位，不得不屈就了。但是，雷瑙德到底是位已成名的大明星，他却不肯低心下首地去求那位史登吉爾，必須史登吉爾來請敎他，他才肯低就呢！因此馬克斯啣了雷瑙德　使命，去和史登吉爾辦交涉去了。馬克斯知道這交涉，是不容易辦的，但是没有法子，祗好去試試了。　　馬克斯走了之後，飯店的經理先生來了。他很慕敬地請勞萊雷瑙德付房金。雷瑙德答應不久就付，經理先生明知那是靠不住的，但是也不便迫人太甚，也祗好就走了。飯店經理走了，雷瑙德喚了一個侍者來，將裝　勒玉照的銀相架，和一個金皮帶頭，和一副袖扣，呌他去當錢。那侍者走了幾家當舖，都不要。他回來了，對著雷瑙德毫無禮貌地道：「一條街的當舖都走到了，他們不要那些爛東西！」雷瑙德肚子餓得很，還是昨天吃的飯，白蘭地倒喝了一大瓶。他又呌了一個侍者來。他點了幾樣東西。但是那侍者道：「先生，對不起，賬房關照過，先生要什麽東西，請付現欵。」勞萊很生氣地摸著自己的口袋，裏面祗有一角七分錢：：：那是他自己早已知道的，因爲他已數了不知道多少次了。他暴怒了，他跳了起來，對者那侍者道：「你給我去拿來！」那侍者連聲答應著「是是。先生」。他鞠著躬退了出去，可是東西並没有拿來。　　勞萊雷瑙德一籌莫展地在屋子襄踱來踱去，心上如同掛了十五只吊桶，七上八落。馬克斯到底爲什麽還不回來呢，大概是絶望了吧？可是到最後，門上的電鈴又吱吱地響了。大概是馬克斯回來了，他連忙喊著「進來！」　　　（未完）</p>

On the 12th, they will fly from Tianjin to Shenyang and return to Changchun. The Kwantung Army sent a plane to Tianjin to welcome them before their departure. Okamura said that the bandits in Funing city have fled the city due to the shelling by the security team. It is not difficult to resolve. This morning, they took a plane and surveyed the area, and the situation there was very chaotic. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Okamura, arrived here this afternoon to discuss with Huang Fu the handover of key passes of the Great Wall by the Japanese army. At the same time, issues such as railway transportation, postal services, and customs duties between China and "Manchukuo" will also be discussed. (6th Reuters Dispatch) Changli: Kita and Okamura flew over Yu to Peiping on the 6th. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Okamura will demand the establishment of customs at the Great Wall during this visit. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) It was learned here today that Okamura will confer with He Yingqin and Huang Fu on the following issues during this visit to Peiping: (1) A detailed agreement on the through train service between Peiping and Shenyang, so that it will no longer be necessary to change trains at Shanhaiguan, and both sides will guarantee not to seize trains. The fees for passenger and freight transport will be shared.

<h3>The Japanese Side Demands that the Security Team Return to Its Original Defense; Designates Liu's Team to Be Stationed in Funing; If This Is Done, the Bandits May Counterattack; Zhang Xiguang Cables the Provincial Government for Instructions; Zhang Visited Endo in Shanhaiguan the Night Before Last and Returned to Changli Yesterday</h3>
<p>A reporter from Changli returned to Changli from Funing on the afternoon of the 6th. Currently, the security in Funing city is maintained by Zhou Yuying's team. Refugees have returned to their homes one after another. Principal Xu of the Changli Huiwen School and American missionaries brought a large amount of relief food into the city this morning to provide relief. County Magistrate Liu Xingpei has not returned to Funing because he went to various bureaus in Tianjin. The bandits who escaped have indeed dispersed to the Tai Touying and Longyao areas. Zhang Xiguang visited Staff Officer Endo in Shanhaiguan on the night of the 5th. The Japanese side has again made a request to us, ordering Zhou's team to return to Tianjin quickly, Dou's team to return to its original defense in Changli, and Liu Zuozhou's team to be stationed in Funing. Zhang believes that Funing city has just been recaptured, and the remaining bandits are in urgent need of pacification. If the elite police team is transferred away, the bandits may counterattack again. Therefore, he has telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. Zhang returned to Changli from Shanhaiguan on the afternoon of the 6th. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Inner Mongolian Autonomy Issues</p>
<h3>People's Organizations in Suiyuan Submit Written Opinions; Clearly Analyze Inner Mongolian Autonomy; Advocate Taking the Banner as the Unit of Autonomy; The Government Should Support the Distressed Mongolians; Huang and Zhao Should Be Able to Make the Trip Within the Next Week</h3>
<p>After the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy arose in Guihua, the people of the Sui League were closely related. After Huang and Zhao arrived in Sui, various groups sent representatives to present everything in person and submitted written opinions on the Inner Mongolian autonomy issue to the central government and Huang, Zhao, etc., stating public opinion and the actual situation of the Mongolian banners. The investigation of the two leagues and thirteen banners in Sui Province, the land reclamation situation of each league and banner, the Sui Province reclamation area, the evolution of the eighteen counties and bureaus in Sui Province, the area, and the population survey are all divided into tables, and the content is extremely important. The analysis of Inner Mongolian autonomy is quite clear, saying that although the autonomy movement is ostensibly a unanimous request from Mongolian princes and young people, each has its own goals and opinions. The so-called princes are purely instigated by Prince De, who wants to expand his authority under a false name and has other intentions. Only a few students feel that the Mongolian banner's politics are corrupt, and their goal is to break the hereditary power of the princes. The people have no opportunity to receive education, have no ability to participate in politics, and do not know what autonomy is. The opinions of the people of Suiyuan on Inner Mongolian autonomy are briefly listed as follows: (1) If the government allows Inner Mongolian autonomy, it should first determine that the banner is the unit of autonomy, directly under the local provincial government, and must not form a separate organization under the false name of joint union. (2) Inner Mongolian politics, economy, population, and Mongolian people's knowledge are all insufficient conditions for local autonomy. Suddenly allowing its autonomy will inevitably evolve into mob despotism. Before autonomy, it should first undergo a considerable period of training and careful preparation. (3) All administrative affairs of the Mongolian banners are freely presided over by the princes and chiefs of each banner. The local government generally does not ask, and the power exceeds the scope of local autonomy of the National Government. The Mongolian people are oppressed by the long-standing prestige of the princes and are extremely distressed. The government should uphold the principle of the unity of the five ethnic groups and support the 150,000 Mongolian people who have been oppressed by the princes for a long time and implement local autonomy.

<p>Zhao Pilian of Guihua said that the organization and personnel of the Frontier Affairs Department must be decided after the inspection returns to Beijing. Xu Yongchang has returned directly from Peiping because Ge Jingen arrived in Taiyuan, and the trip to Sui was terminated. I and Huang will go to Shanxi after this mission here is completed, and then return to Beijing. In recent days, I, Huang, and Fu have only exchanged opinions on Mongolian affairs and the reform of Mongolian administration, without specific discussion. Qin Dechun decided to come to Sui within four days to meet and discuss. Li Songfeng has repeatedly sent telegrams after arriving at Bailingmiao, reporting that the situation is good. Huang and I decided to go to Bailingmiao for inspection after Li and others have negotiated with the princes to a considerable extent, which is expected to be possible within the next week. Prince De and Prince Yun have sent representatives to Sui to sincerely welcome us. People's organizations in Suiyuan have submitted a proposal on Inner Mongolian autonomy, which is detailed and extremely important in relation to the Mongolian banner issue. Huang and I have accepted it for reference. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese and Koreans Establish Auto Shops in Tangshan; Openly Smuggling Arms, Ammunition, and Drugs</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to transportation circles, there were originally three long-distance bus companies in Tangshan City, connecting Zunhua, Yutian, Qian'an, and various counties in northern Hebei. Since the Luandong Incident, they have all closed down. Recently, Japanese and Koreans in Tangshan have taken this opportunity to set up long-distance bus companies, traveling to the above counties. Because they do not pay taxes and no one checks them, in addition to transporting passengers, they openly smuggle arms, ammunition, morphine, opium, heroin, and other drugs. More than 200 Japanese and Korean foreign firms in Tangshan City all hang signs to sell bus tickets, implying the purchase of drugs and smuggling. There are already seven or eight such bus companies established. According to visitors from Tangshan, there are numerous opium dens in Tangshan, totaling more than 200, and smokers account for more than six-tenths of the city's population. The daily sales volume of drugs is about 50 taels of opium and about 70-80 taels of heroin and morphine, which is shocking. Those who transport raw opium transport at least hundreds or thousands of taels each time, all escorted by a certain party. According to scholars, the puppet state has implemented public sales, and the government has a special bureau that charges 1.45 yuan per tael. If raw opium is transported out of the puppet state, a permit will be issued by the special bureau, and it can pass without obstruction. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Military Officer Talks About the Smooth Progress of the Red Army Suppression; The Elite of the Bandits Were Destroyed in the Battle of Zixi; Most of the Bandit Soldiers Want to Surrender and Start Anew</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) According to a military officer who returned to Gan from Zixi on official business, the frontline is progressing smoothly. The bandits are under the threat of the air force above, surrounded by the army below, and economically blockaded from the outside. They hate each other internally. They are indeed shaken and the time of collapse is not far away. However, the two official armies for suppressing bandits are different in combat. Bandits are usually afraid of hard fighting, and most of them are opportunistic and rarely have a definite confrontational front line. When our army arrives, they run away at the news. After our army passes, they come back to attack. However, the bandits' repeated attacks have not succeeded, but have suffered great losses. For example, in the battle of Zixi Bridge this time, our garrison was less than a division. The bandits concentrated their main force, the pseudo-1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th Army Corps, and launched a fierce attack in the thick fog at dawn. Our garrison bravely fought back while telegraphed to the rear. Soon our air force planes came to help. When the bandits heard the sound of the planes, they hid in the forest. The air force flew very low and, after reconnaissance, launched a large-scale bombing. The bandits ran around, and the army took advantage of the victory to fight bravely. In this battle, the bandits suffered more than 7,000 casualties, and the elite and stubborn were almost completely lost. It was an unprecedented and unexpected loss for the bandits. Many bandit soldiers have realized this, and most of them want to surrender and start anew. Now our army has sent planes to distribute leaflets to urge them to return early.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Sworn In; President Wang Ching-wei Conferred the Seal; Ye Chucang Supervised the Oath</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance,</p>
<p>was sworn in at the National Government at 10:30 AM on the 6th. The personnel attending the ceremony were the same as those for the memorial week. Chairman Wang Zhaoming conferred the seal and Ye Chucang, representing the central government, supervised the oath. The swearing-in ceremony was performed as usual. First, Ye Chucang, the representative of the central government, gave a speech, saying that Comrade Kong had followed the Premier for many years and has a profound history with the party and the country. His knowledge and experience are very rich. Now he is the Minister of Finance and takes on a very difficult job during a very difficult period. The loyalty and perseverance of the central government colleagues to the party and the country are deeply admired. However, the way to manage finances lies in stabilizing the people's livelihood. If you want to stabilize the people's livelihood, you should seek to develop the economy. But without the elimination of the bandits, there is no way to build anything. Now the front is supervising the suppression of the Red bandits, and the military expenses are urgent. It is necessary to enrich the military expenses for suppressing the bandits as soon as possible to eliminate the banditry. The financial plan set by Kong before and after taking office is in line with the central policy and will surely make the finances more stable day by day. Then Wang gave a speech, saying that Mr. Kong is knowledgeable and talented, and has rich experience in finance. This time, he will be able to take on the position of Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance. However, the entire financial problem cannot be solved by one person, and everyone must take responsibility together in order to be effective. The central government's policy will continue to be based on the direction of suppressing bandits militarily and economically as advocated by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and myself in the telegraphed opinions. However, bandit suppression is divided into military and political aspects. The military expenses for bandit suppression must be enriched, and the relief and construction of bandit areas are also very important. The basic problem is finance. Mr. Kong once said that a large stone must be moved by a large amount of water, and a little bit will not help. I hope everyone will repeat this statement three times. In the financial field, Mr. Kong will be responsible in the future, and Minister Song can devote all his efforts to the Economic Committee. As for the Executive Yuan, I used to feel that one person could not be competent. In the future, with Mr. Kong's help, all work will be carried out smoothly. Finally, Kong Xiangxi replied, saying that in this time of internal and external troubles and extremely tight finances, Xiangxi was ordered to be the Minister of Finance. I think I am not capable enough to be competent. In the past, Xiangxi has been the acting Minister of Finance for several months, but my experience is limited. However, at this time of going to the national disaster together, I have to take on the difficult task. In the future, the policy will be based on the method of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. On the revenue side, it is planned to rectify the tax collection as much as possible without harming the people's vitality and increase income. On the expenditure side, we must ensure that public funds are not wasted. We should also try our best to raise funds for the bandits' suppression expenses and strive to eliminate the bandits as soon as possible so that the people can live in peace. As for all other financial policies, they will still follow the plans previously set by Minister Song. There are Director Wang and others in the administrative aspect to guide us every day. Xiangxi should work hard to follow and hope not to fall. And most of my colleagues have been friends or comrades for many years. I also ask them to help me at any time so that the government can overcome the current difficulties. It is not only a blessing for Xiangxi personally, but also a blessing for the country and the nation. Then take pictures and the ceremony is over. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi told reporters on the 6th that he will still ask Zou Lin to continue as Political Vice Minister, and Qin Fen, the director of the Accounting Department, will be promoted to the position of Permanent Vice Minister to provide expertise. It can be submitted at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 7th. This trip to Shanghai is to contact Song to hand over and discuss future financial plans. Once the plan is formulated, it can be submitted to the central government for decision. Song is now planning the Economic Committee's implementation and will soon go to Beijing to convene a plenary meeting of the Economic Committee to determine national economic construction.

<h3>From Harbin to Tokyo ·Reality - Tension in Northern Manchuria, Relaxation in Tokyo - ·Reality</h3>
<p>Relations between the Soviet Union and Japan have recently been tense due to the issue of the China Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union, for the sake of consolidating its border defenses, has had to prepare for any eventuality. Japan has also mobilized troops in Northeast China to northern Manchuria. Between the two countries, it seems that there is no other solution than resorting to force. Since the Japanese military mobilization in the three northeastern provinces, commentators have said that Japan has the determination to challenge the Soviet Union and the United States. They believe that the main U.S. naval ports are all more than 3,000 nautical miles away from Japanese fortresses, and that relying solely on a relatively superior battleship fleet would not be able to win an attack. Moreover, the U.S. auxiliary vessels are mostly old and have weak combat capabilities. For them to cross the Pacific Ocean and fight Japan, it is difficult to calculate success in reality. Therefore, it is expected that the United States will never be willing to take military risks for the future interests of the Far East.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's national foundation is just beginning to be solid, and the five-year plan has just been completed. The construction of heavy industry is underway to establish its socialist country. Therefore, it tries its best to maintain friendly relations with foreign countries and establish peaceful diplomacy, and is unwilling to start wars lightly. Therefore, Japan dared to seize our country's territory and sovereignty, and then drive out the Soviet Union's economic forces in northern Manchuria and replace it with Japanese management.</p>
<p>Its method is to use bandit suppression as an excuse. First, the Himeji 10th Division invaded Harbin, and then gradually distributed along the China Eastern Railway, so that the economic management on the China Eastern Railway could not but feel the military threat. At the same time, the Jihui Railway was completed in the shortest time to form a parallel line with the China Eastern Railway. It also used the completed Taoang Railway to cut off the western section of the China Eastern Railway. It prepared the Yanji to Sanxing Railway to cut off the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway. The ports of Chongjin, Najin, and Seishin took a siege offensive against Vladivostok. After a long time, the China Eastern Railway was threatened by the Japanese army from the outside and felt the economic difficulties internally, and was bound to give up on its own. However, the Soviet Union is not weak and has long prepared for offensive and defensive measures. In the past, capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and the United States sympathized with Japan's resistance to the Soviet Union. Now the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union has slightly changed, and between Britain and Japan, there are still many problems at the Delhi Conference. The relationship between France and the Soviet Union is also based on the fact that the mutual non-aggression treaty has been concluded. Japan's diplomacy with Europe has also lost one support. After Roosevelt and Kalinin communicated directly, the restoration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union has gradually become concrete. Although its economic significance is greater than political significance, it also has an impact on the Far East situation. According to general speculation, this situation seems to be related to the tense relations between Japan and the Soviet Union that have been circulating along the China Eastern Railway. Since the China Eastern Railway Conference fell into a stalemate, what each other is fighting for is definitely not a problem of bargaining, but each is exerting its political skills, one wanting to delay time and the other wanting to take the opportunity to seize and hold. Then, will the Soviet Union and Japan really be unable to avoid a war in the near future? Said, that is not the case.</p>
<p>First, Japanese diplomacy is in an absolutely isolated position. Although the economic conflict between the United States and Japan has not reached the extreme, there is no room for mitigation in the battle for hegemony in the Pacific Ocean. Britain does not welcome Japanese forces entering India. These situations are known to Kijuro Shidehara and others, Hirota and others also know it, and even Araki has never known Japan's isolation and dared not rashly launch its foreign war. Second, today's international war must take the entire national economy as the main force. The mobilized military force and the mobilized preparations must be focused on the whole country. Today, Japan has only 100,000 troops in Northeast China. Even if all of them are concentrated in northern Manchuria, the Soviet Union's Far Eastern Army and the Siberian Army, even if they are all concentrated on the border, are not enough to be considered the eve of combat preparations. What's more, there are various tense news about the situation in Japan and the Soviet Union in the three northeastern provinces, although there is a feeling of being unable to live a day. However, in Tokyo, there are still disputes between the military and the government to increase the military budget, and the so-called coup is brewing. How can a country with unresolved domestic political problems launch a foreign war? Therefore, we believe that the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union is indeed becoming more and more acute, but it is only a propaganda of temporary air. For the time being, it will not lead to more major dramatic changes. If the relationship between Japan and the United States and Japan and Britain does not change drastically, then the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union will still be trapped in a long-term stalemate.</p>
<h3>China-Soviet Commercial Treaty Negotiations; Soviet Ambassador Urges Progress</h3>
<p>(Peiping) According to diplomatic sources, although China and Russia have been negotiating a commercial treaty for some time, they have not been completed due to various obstacles. Recently, the Russian side intends to complete the conclusion. It is heard that the Russian ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bogomolov, has proposed to our Foreign Ministry. As for the secret treaty signed by Jin Shuren during his tenure as Chairman of Xinjiang with the Soviet Consul General in Dihua, the National Government declared it invalid at that time and arrested Jin and sent him to the court for prosecution. However, the Soviet side is still trying to urge the Chinese government to recognize the secret treaty signed by Jin. It is heard that the central government has rejected it due to environmental sovereignty and various relationships. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Aircraft Flies into Russian Territory: Nine Aircraft Crossed Thirty Kilometers Over Vladivostok, Russian Ambassador Lodges Protest, Hirota Rejects Immediately</h3>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, Japanese military aircraft soared over the southwest Soviet territory of Vladivostok, over the villages of Slavyanka, Kraskino, Barabash, and Monomayev, etc. According to residents, there were eight reconnaissance planes and one bomber, intruding into the Soviet border, penetrating 25 to 30 kilometers into Soviet territory. Japanese aircraft crossing the Soviet border has been discovered several times before, but in terms of the number of participating aircraft and the distance flown, the actions of Japanese aircraft on the 3rd of this month were unprecedented. (Tass dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Another border dispute between Japan and Russia occurred today due to illegal activities. According to the Russian government, recently, eight Japanese military aircraft flew into Russian territory, circling for a while before leaving. In recent months, the Manchurian puppet organization has frequently accused Soviet Russian soldiers of crossing the Manchurian border, and the Russian government has made similar accusations. Today, the Russian government formally stated that eight Japanese military aircraft, including one bomber, flew over Russian territory near the western coast of Gamov Bay, penetrating 30 kilometers and flying for some time before leaving. No notification was received from the Japanese side beforehand. Currently, the Russian government has not yet filed a formal protest and it is said that instructions will be given to the Russian ambassador to Japan to request an explanation from the Japanese government. (Kokumin dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian Ambassador to Tokyo met with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota today and protested against Japanese aircraft flying over the Russian border. Hirota rejected the protest immediately, saying that after investigation, it was known that although two Japanese aircraft flew near the Russian border for the purpose of suppressing bandits, none crossed the boundary line. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army authorities received a notification from the Soviet government regarding the case of Japanese military aircraft intruding into the airspace over the Vladivostok area. The provincial government immediately telegraphed the Kwantung Army and the Korean Army for inquiry. According to the Kwantung Army's reply telegram received before noon on the 6th, several aircraft were dispatched to the Soviet-Manchurian border area of Vladivostok to suppress insurgents. As for the claim that six aircraft flew over the Vladivostok area, there was absolutely no such thing. Furthermore, the Korean Army had no such event at all. In particular, it has long been instructed that no flights are allowed within 20 kilometers of the Soviet-Manchurian border, and there is no reason to deliberately violate this. Based on this report, it is clear that any error lies on the Soviet Russian side, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will immediately convey this situation to the Soviet government. (Domei dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government newspaper "Izvestia" reprinted a statement quoted by the Osaka Asahi Shimbun of Japan from someone "Experienced in Siberia." The report stated that when the Soviet Union holds the 16th anniversary of the October Revolution, it will hold a "grand military review" in the Soviet Far East, near the Sea of Japan. At that time, bombers will carry numerous bombs and fly into the sea, and mechanized chemical military teams will be concentrated in several locations. "Izvestia" stated that this kind of report is a false and outrageous anti-Soviet discourse spread by Japanese warlords through Japanese newspapers. These warlords need such distortions to cover up their preparations to attack the Soviet Union. (Tass dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Recently, four Soviet Russian soldiers, fully armed, crossed the border to a herding ground seven miles northwest of Mohe, stole fifteen good horses, and took them into Russian territory. During the robbery, three Russian cavalrymen were on the opposite bank of the Amur River, ready to open fire if anyone attacked. The "Manchukuo" authorities will therefore file another protest with the Russian side. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Prediction of Future Air Wars: Tens of Thousands of Aircraft to Participate in Combat, People Devastated, Cities in Ruins, Time Needed No More Than Twelve Hours</h3>
<p>(London) Lord Rothermere, a Labour Party leader with considerable influence in the press, recently gave an interview to a reporter in Paris, discussing the horrors of future air warfare. It will be published by the Daily Mail tomorrow, and it briefly stated, "I oppose the Locarno Treaty" because it stipulates that Britain should assist France, but France has no obligation to assist Britain in times of trouble. This stipulation is unfair, and the treaty implies various obligations that are not clearly defined, which will inevitably lead to disputes during interpretation. If a major war breaks out in Europe in less than ten years, most of it will be limited to air combat, with no less than tens of thousands of aircraft participating in the war. All opinion leaders should make people aware of this point. The horror of a global air war should be known to the people in advance. In the future, the longest war will be no more than twelve hours, and the situation is urgent. British representatives should no longer waste time in Geneva. We should no longer have any illusions about military disarmament agreements, and even if a convention can be established, the various provisions stipulated in practice will be nothing more than a scrap of paper. Who can guarantee that it will be implemented? Therefore, we advocate expanding the air force policy. Although this is regrettable, it is unavoidable. Observing the world's people, few know the horror of air warfare. We should know that in future air wars, as many as 20,000 aircraft may participate, and the loss of life and material will far exceed that of the previous European war. The people will be devastated and the cities will be in ruins, and the suffering will be unspeakable." Lord Rothermere also said that the interests and fate of Britain and France are closely linked. Britain's policy of remaining isolated overseas and not interfering in world affairs is no longer appropriate. I believe that Britain and France should conclude a defensive alliance, formally agreeing to mutually guarantee each other's territories in Europe. The purpose of this alliance is to maintain peace and is by no means against Germany. Rothermere also said that any opportunity to work together with Germany should not be ignored.

<p>The Founder of the Japanese Communist Party</p>
<h3>Katayama Dies of Illness in Russian Capital: Exiled from Japan for Over Twenty Years, Important Figure in the Third International</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Katayama, who organized the Social Democratic Party in Japan in 1901 and initiated the Japanese labor movement, and later organized the Japanese Communist Party and served as its leader, died of illness in Moscow today at the age of seventy-four. Katayama was exiled from Japan more than twenty years ago, resided in Russia for a long time, and was an important member of the Third International. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Mr. Katayama Sen, one of the founders of the Japanese labor movement, a member of the executive committee of the Third International in Russia, passed away due to illness on the 5th, at the age of seventy-four. Katayama was born in Okayama Prefecture. In the 17th year of Meiji, he went to the United States to study hard. After twelve years of research, he embraced socialism and returned to Japan. In Shinoda, Tokyo, he opened the Social Problems Support Association with comrades. In the 31st year of Meiji, he organized the Socialist Research Society with Kōtoku Shūsui and others. In the 34th year, he founded Japan's first proletarian party, the Social Democratic Party, but due to government suppression, it was dissolved only one day after its establishment. Katayama fled to the United States. In the 39th year, he returned to Japan. In the 45th year, when Tokyo streetcar workers went on a general strike, he was arrested and imprisoned. After serving his term, he went to the United States again, and co-published the magazine "Class Struggle" with famous communists such as Trotsky and Bukharin. In 1921, he was elected chairman of the Communist Party of America. In 1922, he went to Russia to attend the Third Congress of the Third International, and was appointed to its executive committee until today. (Domei dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Katayama Sen, the oldest revolutionary communist and important figure in the Third International, passed away on the 5th, before the 16th anniversary of the Soviet Russian Revolution, due to a worsening of his chronic illness, at the age of seventy-four. Since Katayama established the Social Democratic Party in the 34th year of Meiji with Abe Isoo, Kikawa Naoe, Nishikawa Kōjirō, Kawakami Kiyoshi, and Kōtoku Shūsui, he has participated in the socialist movement. In January of the 37th year, Kōtoku Shūsui and Sakai Toshihiko published the Heimin Shimbun, and he joined as a staff member. On August 14th of the same year, during the height of the Russo-Japanese War, he attended the International Socialist Congress in the Netherlands as the Japanese representative. He shook hands with the Russian Social Democratic Party representative Plekhanov, symbolizing the reconciliation of the proletariat of the two warring countries, adding a unique color to the history of the international socialist movement. At the time of Kōtoku's High Treason Incident, he was in the United States. In 1917, during the Soviet Russian Revolution, he responded as a radical communist, engaging in clandestine movements in the United States and Mexico. In 1918, the American government arrested socialists. He pulled out his upper and lower teeth, disguised himself as a Chinese, and fled to Mexico. Later, at the Washington International Economic Conference, he and Taguchi Jizō and others claimed to be Japanese labor representatives, secretly campaigning and doing everything possible to embarrass the Japanese government representatives. During his stay in the United States, he had a close relationship with Lenin and Trotsky in exile, and was the oldest communist. In 1920, he entered Russia, and since then, the Soviet Russian government has treated him with the respect due to an elder statesman. In Japan, he only participated in the early stages of the socialist movement, and he had almost no direct influence on the later communist movement. He lived a quiet and secluded life in Moscow in his later years. (Den-tsu dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Review of Roosevelt's Recovery Achievements: Four Million Unemployed People Regain Employment, But Production Decreases and Living Standards Increase, Low Gold Prices Do Not Match High Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>(Washington) The American Federation of Labor announced today that since the establishment of the National Industrial Recovery Act, more than four million unemployed people have regained employment, of which 1.7 million people obtained jobs in October. However, industrial output has decreased, and the cost of living has increased by 2.3 percent compared to March of this year. The increased wages of workers are not enough to offset this increase. The New York Times today carried the opinion of a famous financier, stating that the dollar has fallen by 35 percent in gold value since April. If the theory that commodity prices can rise accordingly is correct, then commodity prices should have risen by 55 percent compared to April, but the actual increase today is only 33 percent. It also stated that the steel industry and other heavy industries are now lifeless. It is no surprise that major American bankers and merchants are dissatisfied with President Roosevelt's experiments, and this is widely known. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Silver leader Pittman claimed today that the broad minting of silver and a rational gold and silver purchase plan are still effective methods to avoid major monetary inflation. Currently, the inflation faction is spreading propaganda and engaging in a movement against the US President's sound monetary expansion plan. It is predicted that when Congress drafts a monetary legislation bill next spring, it will easily push Congress towards extreme factions. It is reported that the extreme inflation faction, led by Senator Thomas, has agreed to give the President's gold purchase plan at home and abroad a chance to test it. If it still cannot raise commodity prices, they will demand major monetary inflation. (Kokumin dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(New York) American economic expert Babson today, in his weekly economic report, approved of the industrial and commercial sector's self-control plan proposed by Swayne, the chief director of the Industrial Advisory Board, believing that it is feasible. If the government controls the economy, it will inevitably be as harsh and autocratic as Germany and Italy. To avoid this, the only way is to adopt Swayne's plan, by which the industrial and commercial sectors investigate and restrain themselves. Swayne proposed a few days ago that a committee composed of representatives from labor, capital, and the government take over the recovery administration, in order to achieve self-control in industry and commerce, but the government does not quite agree. The White House indicated that this plan must be implemented after industry and commerce prove that they can control themselves. Currently, the time is not yet ripe. In addition, several members of the Senate Committee investigating the securities market proposed to authorize the subcommittee to permanently supervise banks and major markets. Upon receiving reports of banks or companies violating federal regulations or banking laws, the subcommittee would immediately investigate. However, bankers here strongly disagree with this proposal, claiming that the Senate committee has already fully restrained bankers. If this suggestion is adopted, the result will only lead to endless investigations that outweigh the benefits. (Kokumin dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>American Agrarian Uprising Erupts into Armed Conflict: Two Million People Join the Strike</h3>
<p>Des Moines Farmers in several Midwestern states of the United States have joined the strike movement after President Roosevelt opposed fixing the prices of agricultural products, and more than two million people have now joined. The agrarian unrest has entered a stage of armed conflict. Iowa farmers' leaders have ordered farmers to use all kinds of tools. Therefore, hand-to-hand combat, bomb explosions, gunfire, and the destruction of dairy barns have become characteristics of the agrarian unrest. At the same time, Agriculture Secretary Wallace and the governors of various agricultural states are drafting a new procedure that includes standardized prices, quota regulations, and government purchases of surplus general measures.

<h3>New Changes in British Political Parties: Conservative Party Suffers Failures Everywhere in Local Elections, Current Cabinet Increasingly Anxious Due to This Blow, Prime Minister MacDonald Plans to Form a New Political Party</h3>
<p>(London) During the recent change of the Eastern Fulham area, the Conservative Party fought alone and failed. Cabinet members are now studying these lessons. It is reported that Prime Minister MacDonald and others are now planning to form another political party to replace the existing Conservative Party. This view is supported by the Simon faction and the Labour Party and Conservatives who support national unity. However, if a new party is formed, some Conservatives will naturally move independently.</p>
<p>Today, the National Labour Committee held a banquet, with a total of 300 attendees, including key figures such as MacDonald, Baldwin, and Simon. MacDonald gave a brief speech, saying that Baldwin, Simon, and himself differed in their political views, but they were united in their goals. The current government of national character is a mixture, and when the country needs this mixture, this mixture does not want to break up. This unity in trade and conferences is the greatest force in the world for stability. Attacking the government now is attacking it where it is effective. The government has not publicized it sufficiently, and this must be corrected, because a government of national character must have publicity of a national character. Simon followed with a speech, saying that changes in party politics in the minds of the British people cannot be ignored. The old disputes and divisions no longer exist. He also said that the threat that the British parliamentary system is currently facing is the threat of dictatorship. All parties must unite to protect Britain from this danger. Baldwin also took the floor and stated that the current government is a long-term combination. There is still much time before the next general election, and there are many things to be done. Therefore, he is not worried about the duration of the government's existence. Britain is now in a better position than it was two years ago. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Seizes Absolute Power: Merges Three Departments of Army, Navy, and Air Force</h3>
<p>Rome The Italian Emperor has approved the resignations of Air Minister Balbo and Navy Minister Siriani. The two cabinet members met with Mussolini, and it is reported that Mussolini plans to organize a Ministry of National Defense and place the army and navy under unified jurisdiction. Balbo has been appointed as the Governor of Libya in Africa, replacing Badoglio, who will be appointed as the Chief of the General Staff. The vice ministers of the Navy and Air Force have also resigned with their ministers. Balbo is a very important figure in the Fascist Party. Since taking office in 1929, he has reorganized the Italian Air Force with remarkable results. He has twice led squadrons of aircraft across the Atlantic to visit the Americas. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome Italian Prime Minister Mussolini reorganized the cabinet today, concurrently serving as the Minister of Aviation and Navy, in preparation for the establishment of a Ministry of National Defense by merging the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Under Mussolini, the Vice Minister of the Navy, Canavari, and the Vice Minister of Aviation, Val, will temporarily assist him.

<h3>Hitler Seizes Military Power: To Be Implemented After Cabinet Reshuffle at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>(Paris) George Brown, a reporter stationed in Berlin for the Journal, issued a message stating that the reform of the German constitution and administration is now proceeding rapidly. By November 30th of this year, Hitler's Third German State will be definitively established. The reporter also said that Hitler intends to reshuffle the cabinet. The cabinet members will be distributed as follows: Prime Minister Hitler, Deputy Prime Minister Rudolf, Foreign Minister Papen (the current Deputy Prime Minister), Finance Minister Dr. Lopez, Defense Minister General Eib (the current Prime Minister of Bavaria), Chief of Staff General Bleicher (the current Minister of National Defense), Military Administration General Reichert (the current Vice Minister of Military Administration), Central Aviation Police and Speaker of the House Goering (the current Prime Minister of Prussia, Minister of Central Aviation, and Speaker of the House), Religion Goebbels (the current Propaganda Department under the organization will be abolished), Justice Frank, Commerce Robena (the current Minister of Posts and Transportation), Economy Schmidt (unchanged), Food Will (unchanged), Interior Flick (unchanged), President of the Leipzig Supreme Court Dr. Gurte. This cabinet reshuffle, on the one hand, is to unify Germany, and on the other hand, to extend the "conservation principles" represented by Hitler to the National Defense Force. Until now, the National Defense Force and the General Staff have not participated in the new political system. This time, the appointment of General von Reichert as the Minister of National Defense and General Reichert as the Minister of Military Administration not only places the command of the army into the hands of the National Socialist Party, but also allows for the reform of the army when the political situation permits, because von Reichert himself is a member of the National Socialist Party, and Reichert also sympathizes with National Socialist ideology. The Journal reporter concluded that "the cabinet reshuffle plan is to establish a new foundation in preparation for the future reform of the army." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Elbe Today, German Prime Minister Hitler spoke to more than 20,000 people here. At the same time, 60,000 people in East Prussia and Danzig listened to the broadcast of Hitler's speech. Hitler claimed that Germany demanded equality in armaments. If other countries can implement disarmament, Germany is willing to follow suit. Now, Germany is united from top to bottom. This matter can be shown to the world in the general election on the 11th of this month. Germany's only need is peace, because without peace, Germany's unity cannot be achieved. Finally, Hitler claimed that the number of people who have fled Germany to date has reached 64,000, but only one percent of them are political prisoners, and the rest have failed in their careers and can no longer stay in Germany.

<h3>Shaw on Germany's Withdrawal from the League of Nations: Sufficient to Completely Change the Position of Europe</h3>
<p>Munich The European Review, published in Munich, Germany, previously raised a question in response to Germany's declaration of withdrawal from the League of Nations, seeking answers from famous writers from various countries. The British playwright George Bernard Shaw has now sent his answer, praising Hitler's achievements. He said, "German Prime Minister Hitler's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference is a great feat in international politics, sufficient to completely change his position in Europe. Therefore, the attitude of British public opinion has also changed accordingly. Those who used to hate Hitler's Germany now understand it. This is clear evidence that this move is beneficial. Moreover, today, the whole world is tired of France's childish and terrifying demands. The peace that France demands is a peace that cannot be achieved, and the pacifism they proclaim is what Britain and other countries want to use to cover up their unwillingness to disarm themselves. Therefore, what the country needs today is a bold and decisive leader with clear vision, so that the world knows Germany's firm demand for equal armaments." Shaw further said, "Hitler's move not only did not throw Europe into the flames of war, but also saved Europe from falling off a cliff. Hitler knew that the most urgent period in history had arrived, and he raised his arm and called out, and the world was shocked by it. Now, Britain has begun to develop a fondness for Mr. Hitler, just like it did for Mussolini before. What is now expected is only the national election on Saturday and Sunday, but I do not believe that there are people within Germany who will vote against Hitler."</p>

<h3>U.S. and Russia Open Talks Soon: Soviet Russian Losses Offset U.S. Debt Theory</h3>
<p>(New York) According to a report issued by the American Fund for the Committee on American-Russian Relations, Soviet Russia's demands for compensation for the damage caused by the Allied intervention in Siberia will be a major issue in this week's US-Russian diplomatic talks. Soviet Russia still insists that this damage amounts to six million yuan. It is expected that Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov will meet with the US President and ask the American people to acknowledge most of this damage to offset the debt claims that the United States is asking from the Imperial Russian and Kerensky governments. Litvinov will arrive in New York early Tuesday morning. After landing on the shore, he will take a train to Washington. Important US government officials will meet him at the train station and will have him stay at the American-Russian newspaper bureau on Jossa Street. It is also heard that the US President will leisurely discuss with Litvinov in the White House and the two parties are not eager to end things hurriedly. (Kokumin Sha Electric, 5th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Cedes Land to Japan: Japan to Immigrate to East Africa, Italy Feels Uneasy</h3>
<p>Rome The East African country of Abyssinia wants to cede 1,000 acres of land to Japan for cotton cultivation. It may still be linked to the concession of other enterprises.

The London Morning Post today reported from Rome that Abyssinia does not want to develop relations with Italy.

<h3>Indian-Japanese Conference Reaches Agreement: Outline of Agreement Already Resolved</h3>
<p>New Delhi: The Indian and Japanese cotton industry representatives met here today. The Japanese representative, Mr. Sawada, has recovered from his illness and attended the meeting. It is reported that the outline of the agreement has already been resolved and is now awaiting approval from the Japanese government.

Efforts will be made to ensure that this agreement takes effect from November 10th. The Indian government will soon submit a bill to the Legislative Council to implement this agreement. Today's discussions were related to the Japanese cotton industry's opposition to the categorization of imported cotton goods. The Japanese side is concerned that this categorization will prevent them from utilizing their full quota.

The Japanese side now feels that an agreement can be reached based on today's talks, and the terms have been forwarded to Tokyo for instructions, so that an agreement can be concluded with the Indian government.

<h3>British Parliamentarian Advocates Active Assistance to China to Restore Former Leadership Position in China</h3>
<p>(London) Today, Conservative Member of Parliament Lord Wardington wrote a letter published in The Times, stating that now is the best opportunity for Britain to restore its former leading position in China. He advocated that Britain should assist the Chinese government to the extent possible, while leading China towards peace and recovery. However, to achieve this goal, a more assertive policy than the current one must be adopted. Mr. Ward also advocated that the British Embassy in China should be moved from Peiping to a location closer to the south. This would show the British government's attitude towards China, changing from estrangement to friendship. The situation in China is now more stable than before, and the current Chinese government has greater prestige than any previous government. However, the Chinese government is currently facing difficulties and needs moral support. Looking at all the major powers, the British Empire is the best suited to provide China with the best assistance. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Hamaaguchi Assassination Case: Sagoya Sentenced to Death</h3>

Chief Judge Izumi, Prosecutor Furuta, and lawyers Umezawa, Akiyama, Hiramatsu, Kadooka, and Hayashi were present. The final verdict was announced at 10 a.m. today. Due to rumors of right-wing groups plotting to seize the defendants, the court and its surroundings were heavily guarded by armed police and military police from the Metropolitan Police Department. Chief Judge Izumi announced, "Sagoya and Matsuki's appeals are rejected." Thus, Sagoya's death sentence was confirmed, and Matsuki's sentence of eight years' imprisonment was confirmed. In the first trial, the issue of Dr. Shiota's expert testimony in Sagoya's "completed murder" case was debated, and the appeal court changed the charge to attempted murder. However, the sentence remained the same as in the first trial, except that Matsuki's sentence was reduced by five years to eight years' imprisonment. (Dentsu, 6th)</p>

<h3>Nanking City Holds National Goods Promotion Week</h3>

The venue was covered with slogans promoting national goods. After the ceremony, Chairman Shi Ying reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the national goods movement in the capital has been going on for many years, but this is the first time for a joint expanded promotion. Currently, foreign goods are flooding the market, and domestic goods are sluggish. We must pay special attention to resisting foreign goods and not pursue our own selfish desires, sending the fruits of our hard work to foreigners. The major purpose of this promotion week is to awaken our compatriots, work hard to promote national goods, and vow to resist enemy goods. Once the leaks are plugged, the country will naturally become rich and the people strong. Our country's manufactured goods are becoming increasingly developed. Whatever foreigners have, we also have, which is sufficient for the use of our people, and the prices are cheap and the quality is good, surpassing foreign goods. In the midst of this call for promoting national goods, we see merchants who forget righteousness for profit, disguising foreign goods as domestic goods and selling them in the market, which is unforgivable. It is hoped that all compatriots in the country, in addition to actively using national goods, should also supervise and report on such behavior. Subsequently, Chu Minyi, Peng Xuepei, and Chen Lifu delivered speeches, elaborating further. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>Reports on Reorganizing Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanking) The Central Committee held its 103rd Memorial Week at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th. Over 400 people attended, including Ye Chucang, Gu Mengyu, Zhang Zhen, Deng Jiayan, and Kong Xianglin, among others. Gu Mengyu presided over the meeting, and Kong Xiangxi reported that China's finances were primarily based on land tax in the past. It was not until after trade with foreign countries that customs duties were introduced. Subsequently, due to the Boxer Rebellion, a large portion of the customs revenue was allocated to the Boxer Indemnity and as security for other loans. Therefore, only a small portion of customs duties entered the national treasury. Recently, finances have indeed become difficult, with a monthly shortfall of more than 12 million. Reorganization should primarily focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The way to increase revenue should start with reorganizing the old tax sources, reorganizing the administration of finances, eliminating all malpractices, increasing income, and ensuring that income and expenditure are balanced. Currently, every country's finances are facing difficulties, not just China alone. However, if the people of the country can make sacrifices, understand the current situation of the government, and work together, we will be able to overcome this difficulty. The meeting was adjourned after the speech. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>Detailed Report on the War in Guizhou Province: Allied Army and Provincial Army Confront Each Other, War Situation is Dire</h3>
<p>(Nanking) There are various rumors about the war in Guizhou. The news from Nanking and Guangdong is conflicting. Wang Jialie said that there is no war in Guizhou, while Guangdong telegraphed that You Guocai has obtained the help of Long Yun and is already in contact in Zhenyuan. However, You's army is in Xingren, the westernmost part of Guizhou, while Zhenyuan is in the easternmost part of Guizhou, a distance of 1,200 li, which is far from the truth. Nanking specifically sent a letter to inquire with Guizhou and obtained the following detailed report: Since You Guocai, stationed in Xingren on the western route, obtained three regiments from Long Yun of Yunnan, led by Wan Baobang and others, and entered Guizhou from Xingren, in addition to ordering his troops to advance towards the Huajiang River, he also arranged for Jiang Zaizhen on the northern route and Lei Mingjiu, Yang Qichang, and Che Mingyi on the eastern route to launch their attacks simultaneously. Wang Jialie has now appointed Liu Mingjie as the Commander-in-Chief of the western route, leading eight regiments to march towards Zhenning. The military affairs on the northern route are still handled by Hou Zhi in Chishui, with Yuan Jinwen and Hou Zhixi added to assist Hou Hanyou, who was originally stationed in Zunyi. On the eastern front, Liao Huaizhong, Wang Tianxi, Pi Guangze, Cao Tianquan, and others have long been dispatched to confront each other, and have been firing in Zhenyuan for days. However, the background of the allied army is complex. You Guocai relies entirely on Long Yun of Yunnan, Jiang Zaizhen also relies entirely on Liu of Sichuan, Yang Qichang and Che Mingyi rely entirely on Chen Quzhen of Hunan, and Lei Mingjiu relies entirely on someone from the Xingyi faction for full support. This is why the war in Guizhou can be expanded and why the future of the war is becoming increasingly dangerous. It is reported that people in and outside Guizhou are extremely angry at You Guocai's seduction of the Yunnan army. Those living in Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Peiping have even distributed leaflets accusing You of selling out the province for personal gain. The reason why the allied armies are willing to collude with neighboring provinces is that they are forced to do so by Wang Jialie's active purchase of machinery from Guangdong and Guangxi. Currently, in order to avoid opposition from Guizhou people living abroad and to contact various parties, Mao Guangxiang has sent Qiu Yunchang, the former head of the Nanking office, and Adjutant Han Wen, carrying a large sum of money, to travel around Chongqing, Wuhan, Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Qiu and Han have arrived in Shanghai and are staying in an automobile building on Bail Er Road. It is said that the work of overthrowing Wang will be successful. Someone who is aware of the content of the telegrams and military supplies from a certain party supporting Lei Mingjiu said that Yan Laoren has volunteered to contact his sworn brother, so and so, to guarantee passage through Hunan Province, and will soon see the allied army approaching Guiyang. Even without the assistance of Sichuan and Yunnan, the allied army has more people and weapons than Wang Jialie. However, the provincial army is a whole unit, with excellent weapons and many experienced generals, which is unmatched by the allied army. The actual strength of both sides is investigated below, based on regiments as units. (1) Under Wang Jialie, there are Jiang Ronghua, Dai Yutang, Zhou Xiangkui, Jiang Delin, Wu Binglin, Du Shaohua, Bi Jun, Wan Shixiong, Luo Yongzhong, Song Shaokui, Shang Shixian, Wu Guangquan, Zhang Ligong, Li Niansun, and other 14 regiments, as well as the special technology training office and independent battalions of mortars and machine guns, totaling about 18 complete regiments. (2) On the allied army side, You Guocai has He Shaoqing, Liu Mingxiang, You Kai, Luo Xiaopeng, Luo Dajing, You Shaoqing, and other 6 regiments under his command. Jiang Zaizhen has 5 regiments under his command, including himself, Yuan Binglin, Fu Hengzhong, Fan Guangdou, and Ouyang Wen. Lei Mingjiu has Mao Zhuopu, Liu Shutang, Long Wanzhang, Bai Shuting, and other 4 regiments under his command. Yang Qichang has Lin Xiusheng, Fan Fuchang, and Luo Jinbai, 3 regiments. Yang Changshi has Yan and other 4 regiments. Che Mingyi has Jin Lidian, Long Gaocheng, Weng Xiaoxu, Wang Guangzhong, Long Pinghou, and other 5 regiments. In addition, Chen Quzhen sent Li Keda to lead Zhang Huiqing, building the Yuping, 2 regiments to join the allied army, allied army totaling about 26 regiments. Therefore, even if Sichuan and Yunnan no longer send troops into Guizhou, the allied army has about 8 regiments more than Wang's army. This is the actual situation of the confrontation between the two sides. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Jialie telegraphed Guangdong on the 2nd, saying that Che Mingyi's troops on the eastern route, near the Hunan rebel army, Chen Quzhen's troops, fled into the Sichuan border. The base of Tongren was occupied by our army. Chen's four regiments mutinied and were intercepted by Hunan. The western route has come to an end. Yunnan and Chongqing do not assist You, and Lie still treats You peacefully. If You's troops still do not wake up, then right and wrong will be judged by public opinion. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Chiang Orders Strict Searches for Bandit Spies in All Departments, Bandit Groups Use Detective Warfare to Survive, Actively Searching Now to Prevent Bandit Schemes</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication, The scourge of Zhu Mao has plagued five or six provinces and has been harmful for six or seven years. Although it is now claimed to be hundreds of thousands, in fact, its main force is only the pseudo-First Army Corps Lin Biao, the pseudo-Third Army Corps Peng Dehuai, the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps Dong Zhentang, the pseudo-Newly Compiled Seventh Army Corps Fang Zhimin, and each group, totaling no more than thirty or forty thousand guns, even together with its wings, such as the pseudo-Jiangxi Military Region Chen Yi, the pseudo-Fujian Military Products Luo Binghui, the pseudo-Gan-Zhejiang Military Region Tang Zaigang, the pseudo-Gan-E-Xiangbian Military Region Kong Hechong, the pseudo-Gan-Xiangbian Military Region Xiao Ke, the pseudo-Gan-Min Military Region Xiao Jingguang, and other scattered bandits such as the pseudo-Independent Division, guerrillas, Red Guards, and regimental teams, the statistics are also less than 100,000 guns. The National Army's suppression troops are more than ten times that number. However, Zhu Mao was able to stubbornly resist with a gang of bandits lacking both salaries and weapons. According to military observers, the reasons why the bandits are not easy to eliminate are nothing more than the following points: (1) Strict organization and unified command; (2) Secret and rapid action; (3) Accurate shooting; (4) Spies are ubiquitous; (5) Good at mountain warfare, pass warfare, and night warfare, etc. Regarding the above items, Chiang Kai-shek has taught the strategy of breaking the bandits when training various departments in Lushan, especially paying special attention to the detective item. A section of Chiang's speech on improving tactics was published the other day, which briefly said: "The reason why the current bandits can use very small forces to resist our very large forces is that our intelligence officers are too poor and inferior to them. That is, the detective war I talked about in the bandit suppression handbook cannot defeat him. Now, all military commands must be based on intelligence, so detective warfare is really the central war. It can be said that the success or failure of the bandit suppression war in the future depends on this, so all officials should pay special attention to the organization of intelligence," etc. This is enough to prove what Chiang is paying attention to. According to reports, in addition to using banditized people to form a strict detective network in the bandit area, the Red bandits' detective methods are ingenious for our rear. From forging official seals and passports to prostitution and begging, there is nothing they don't do. The Operations Department recently reported according to Wang Jiahui, Director of Political Training of the Thirty-first Division, that according to Hao Zhenxi, the pseudo-Chief of Staff of the bandits, the bandits have a radio station in Shanghai to communicate with various counties in Jiangxi and Sichuan. In addition to using radio to spy, the bandits have also set up a special detective team. Their methods of sneaking into various places are to disguise themselves in plain clothes and imitate the official seal style of the National Army's notices to make various passports and symbols, posing as National Army officers and soldiers, traveling to and from Pinghan, Jinghu and other places. All have been repeatedly tested by bandit spies, and the military police cannot find out, etc. After Chiang reported this, he has ordered various departments to search and prevent the bandits' spies, so that the bandits' spies cannot sneak in and spy and cannot develop their cunning plans.

<h3>Sichuan Province Bandit Suppression Overview, Xu's Bandits Attempt to Open Up the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road, Rumors Say Liu Xiang Will Go to Suining to Supervise Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication, Xu Xiangqian's bandits roamed northern Sichuan and occupied ten counties. The three departments of Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, and Liu Zaihou were successively defeated by the bandits, and they obtained a lot of weapons. After the fall of Suiding, the bandits obtained a large amount of military supplies. They now have nearly 50,000 guns. The mob of rabble can be no less than 100,000. The disaster of prairie fire is already imminent. The bandits initially used Bazhong as their base, and the main force was gathered here, intending to capture Cangxi Langzhong, annex the left bank of the Bianling River, and then seek further progress. Tian Songyao's troops defended the danger, and they were unable to succeed. Then they returned to the east and attacked and captured Suixuan without bloodshed. Suiding became their main nest again. After the bandits occupied this famous city, they had to seek a way out. Everyone suspected that they would go east to Kaijiang and spy on Kuiwan. In fact, the bandits' intention was to open up the Sichuan-Shaanxi road. Therefore, as soon as Sui Suiding fell, bandits were sent to Chengkou. Their claim that they wanted to attack eastern Sichuan was just a feint. Now Liu Xiang has arrived in Chengdu, and it is rumored that he will go to Suining to supervise bandit suppression and reorganize the various armies. It is planned that Wang Lingji and Fan Shaozeng will be responsible for the line of Dazhu, Guang'an, and Kaijiang to attack Suiding. Yang Sen, Li Qixiang, and Luo Zezhou will be responsible for the line of Shunqing and Yingshan to attack Qu County. Tian Songyao will be responsible for the line of Cangxi and Langzhong to attack Yilong Tongjiang. Deng Xihou will be responsible for the line of Zhaohua and Guangyuan to attack Nanjiang Bazhong, forming a large encirclement. In addition, two divisions of Feng Qinzaizhi and others will guard the Shaanxi border to prevent their escape. It is found that the expansion of the bandits this time, Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou, are undoubtedly responsible for losing the opportunity, and Liu Xiang's fostering of the tumor cannot escape considerable responsibility. Liu was promoted to the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in Sichuan Province in July, and only took office on October 4th. At that time, it was inevitable that the bandits were still far away and could not invade the defense area, or even had the selfish intention of using foreign enemies to eliminate internal enemies. Therefore, he deliberately showed leisure and sang the high-profile of settling Sichuan first and then suppressing bandits, and he was careless in the arrangement of affairs. When the bandits chased eastern Sichuan, he began to panic, search for levies, and disturb the market. However, the westward steamers stopped in Yichang, and the Wanzhou Bank experienced runs. Liu has no talent for high-level leadership, and lacks the magnanimity to accommodate people. The flames of the enemy are spreading, and the internal strife is endless. It is appropriate for the Sichuan situation to be devastated and beyond repair. (4th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang, Students of Zhuanqiao Primary School Kidnapped by Bandits</h3>
<p>Residents of Zhuanqiao Town, at the junction of Songjiang and Shanghai, recently used the excuse of abundant autumn harvest to invite a troupe to perform a play to thank the gods. The day before yesterday was the last day of the performance. Because the students in Zhuanqiao Primary School all wanted to go to see the play in the afternoon, the principal dismissed school early. Among them, a student surnamed Shen was kidnapped by bandits while passing by. The other students all ran home. After Shen's parents reported the incident to the police for investigation, their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>Large Gang of Lake Bandits Discovered in East Tai Lake</h3>

Captain Wei immediately dispatched the Seventh, Eleventh, and Fourteenth Teams to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou, Play Bandit Gu Asong Arrested</h3>
<p>The bandit Gu Asong is a native of Anding, 30 years old. He has committed many crimes in Huangdu and other places. He was once arrested by the authorities and sentenced to six years in prison. After serving his sentence, he was imprisoned twice and then released. Last year, during the Shanghai War, Zhang Guansheng, a tailor from Xinzha Road, Shanghai, took his wife A Yun (24 years old) to Anting to take refuge. Gu broke into the room at night and raped A Yun. He escaped afterwards. Not long after, he was arrested by the Jiading County Government and imprisoned. After sixty-eight days, when the 19th Route Army was retreating to the second line of defense, Jiading was frequently attacked by bandits. Gu instigated the crowd in prison to pour rice into the manure bucket and took the opportunity to riot and escape from prison. He also gathered people to rob Siku Town. On June 27th this year, he and his accomplices went to rob the homes of Lu Qixing and Lu Zhixin, villagers of Lujia Village, Huangdu, and shot and killed Lu Qixing, the victim, and injured two of Lu's wives and concubines. After the case occurred, County Magistrate Yang of Jiading ordered the subordinates to arrest him. Gu, fearing that the news would spread, fled outside. Last month, when it was learned that Gu had returned to Anting, a detective was sent to arrest him, but Gu had already taken his wife and fled, hiding at No. 712 Shantang Street, Suzhou. Yesterday (6th) at noon, Yao Zhimin, a detective from Jiading County, followed him to Suzhou and met him on the Luyun Road. He stepped forward to arrest him and sounded the alarm to bring him into the 32nd Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau. Gu used the alias Zhou Zuquan, but directly admitted to the above cases, but claimed that he escaped with everyone during the war in the section on escaping from prison. After the interrogation, he was sent to the bureau to wait for the Jiading County Government to prepare documents to bring him out.</p>
<h3>Wuxi, Garment Industry Storm Calmed, The Public Security Second Sub-bureau outside Guangfu Gate</h3>
<p>Following the county order to ban water tanks in each garment store and shop, which encroached on sidewalks, a dispute arose with Zhang Ergou, a shop assistant at the Xicheng garment shop on Hanchang Road on the morning of the 5th. The police took Zhang to the bureau for handling. After all the garment shops in the city learned of this, they were unanimously indignant, went on strike one after another, and sent a letter to Cheng Jingtang, the town leader of Hanzhen, to find ways to provide relief. That night, Town Leader Cheng sent a letter to Fan Xinzhi, the head of the Second Sub-bureau, guaranteeing Zhang Ergou's release. All encroachments on the sidewalk were reduced as appropriate to avoid obstructing traffic. Each garment shop considered it satisfactory and resumed business at 8 am yesterday (6th). However, the case of banning vendors has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, 1,314 vendors throughout the city, due to hunger and cold, and no place to make a living, specially sent six representatives with a petition to the county government for the second time, requesting to withdraw the order to maintain their livelihoods. Yu Tianfen, the head of the First Section, came out to meet them. The result of the petition was not successful. Each representative reluctantly left and went to the County Chamber of Commerce to petition, but no one met them and they left. Then they went to the City Property Committee to petition, but there was no corresponding result.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Seals Huishun Silkworm Cocoons</h3>
<p>After Xi Huian, the owner of Huishun Silk Factory under Huigong Bridge in this county, ran away due to debt (debt disputes became increasingly serious), the County Chamber of Commerce acted as an intermediary to mediate and proposed a liquidation plan. Eight dan and twelve bundles of silk stored in the factory were sold by Zhou Wei, a representative of the workers, for more than four thousand yuan, and wages were paid. The scattered dry cocoon households were panicked and negotiated with Zhou, dragging people to the Second Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, but they were not resolved and left. On the one hand, they also went to the County Chamber of Commerce and the County Government to petition, requesting to find ways to liquidate. Qian Sunqing, a supervisor of the Chamber of Commerce, went to the County Government to discuss the liquidation plan with County Magistrate Yan at 10 am yesterday. It was decided that the dry cocoons stored in each cocoon warehouse in the factory would be sealed immediately and handled by the Chamber of Commerce, and the County Government would inform the relevant warehouses to comply. The Chamber of Commerce then sent Ji Songzhen, carrying seals, accompanied by Fan Xinzhi, the head of the Second Sub-bureau, to seal them. Afterwards, they could be unsealed only with the permission of the County Government, and it was decided to invite all parties to discuss the solution at the Chamber of Commerce at 3 pm on the 8th of this month. The Chamber of Commerce will send letters to the two guilds of silk and cocoon and the relevant banks and money shops, and the relevant cocoon warehouses in advance to inform them.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang, County Magistrate Ye Continues to Raise Medical Expenses</h3>
<p>Ye Zhendong, the county magistrate of Zhenjiang County, learned that the people in Dongchang Street, Nanqingshan, and other places in the Second District of Jurong were suffering from a malignant malaria, which was extremely dangerous. County Magistrate Ye sent personnel to conduct an on-site investigation, and about 200 men, women, old and young who suffered from the disease died without medical treatment. Last month, he sent a letter to the Provincial Hospital to establish a temporary clinic in Dongchang Street, and the county applied to the Provincial Department for discretionary approval of the expenses. Now 300 yuan has been allocated, but there are too many patients, and the expenses are extremely stretched. A medical officer from the Provincial Hospital recently claimed that the medicines purchased for 300 yuan have been used up. County Magistrate Ye is now working hard to raise 1,000 yuan to be handed over to the Provincial Hospital to continue purchasing medicines.</p>
<h3>Nantong, Establishment of County Literature Committee</h3>
<p>The Nantong Chronicles have not been revised for a long time. County Magistrate Cheng Yuyan believes that Nantong is a gathering place for ancient and modern literature, and the development of various undertakings in the county requires the continued collection and preservation of all literature. On the 5th, he specially established a County Literature Committee and promoted Zhang Xiaoruo and others as members.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou, Bai Weixiang's Case Concluded by the High Court</h3>
<p>Bai Weixiang, the head of Gongtian Township in the Second District of this county, was accused by Xu Yongnian and other villagers of the township last year for killing 17 members of Xu's family when the levee broke in the 20th year. The former judge Zhang Cheng concluded the trial and sentenced Bai Weixiang to five years in prison for instigating murder. Bai felt wronged and refused to accept the first instance judgment, so he appealed to the Suzhou Higher Court. After repeated trials by the court, the final hearing the other day ordered Bai Weixiang to be released on bail. It is heard that Township Chief Bai has returned to You last night (3rd).</p>

<h3>Airplane Leaflets</h3>
<p>The Aviation Administration specially sent two airplanes to Shanghai the day before yesterday. At 9 am yesterday, they took tens of thousands of small five-color leaflets and took off from Hongqiao Airport at the same time, circling around the city inside and outside the city and distributing leaflets. When the two airplanes, one with yellow wings and one with gray wings, flew to the sky above the City Chamber of Commerce one after another, they flew quite low and performed dragonfly skimming and other performances. At the same time, five-color leaflets danced all over the sky, and citizens stood still and looked up, competing to pick up the leaflets. At 10:30, the plane began to land and flew back to the team in Hangzhou at 1:00 pm yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>At about 10 o'clock, the military band of the Public Security Bureau played music to open the meeting. After performing the ceremony, Mayor Wu (represented by Yu Hongjun), Tong Xingbai, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Meiyan, Zhu Xuefan, and others were publicly elected as the presidium. Tong Xingbai reported, briefly saying that today various circles are holding the Anti-Bandit Movement Propaganda Conference here, just when Chairman Chiang is leading soldiers to suppress bandits in the front, but we are very comfortable in the rear, but the fundamental way is to rely on the entire strength of the national people to help, so that the front has no worries, and then it can succeed. The policy of the Red Bandits is developing in many ways. The army is suppressing the Red Bandits in the front, which is solving a part of the Red Bandits. If we want to thoroughly eliminate the Red Bandits, we must proceed in multiple directions. Therefore, we the people should do propaganda work with political means in the rear. The Red Bandits harm China, and their crimes are too numerous to describe. The people have suffered a great indirect and direct impact from their harm. It can be seen that bandit suppression is not for the government, but for the people. If the Red Bandits are not eliminated for one day, the people will not be able to live and work in peace. We must know that the elimination of the Red Bandits is the joint responsibility of the people. Only by checking our own work can we not lose the purpose of today's Anti-Bandit Propaganda Conference.</p>
<h3>Summary of Speeches</h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, Gao Yingzu, a representative of the Central Propaganda Committee, gave a speech, briefly saying that our country has been plagued by disasters for years. Japan is taking advantage of our bandit riots and natural disasters to implement its aggressive policies. At that time, all circles believed that we must first resist foreign aggression and then stabilize the country, so the central government sent the anti-bandit army in Jiangxi south to help, and the Red Bandits took advantage of this to be rampant. Therefore, the government knew that we must first stabilize the country and then resist foreign aggression. However, the strength of bandit suppression cannot be effectively achieved by relying on the military force of the government. It must be assisted by the political power of the national people to be effective, and so on. Then, Yu Hongjun, the secretary-general of the municipal government, gave a speech on behalf of the mayor, briefly saying, today, brothers represent Mayor Wu to participate in the anti-bandit propaganda, and have two feelings: (1) The most effective way to publicize is to work; (2) Today, everyone is here to participate, not because we are publicizing to you, but because we hope that you will publicize to all circles. Some people say that our country should now reorganize national defense, restore rural bankruptcy, and implement construction plans, but we can only restore the rural economy after bandits are eliminated, and then we can implement construction, and then we can talk about national defense, and so on. Subsequently, Wang Xiaolai of the City Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Xuefan of the General Labor Union, Lin Meiyan of the City Party Headquarters, and others gave speeches one after another, with many encouraging words, and dispersed after shouting slogans at the end.</p>
<h3>Slogans</h3>
<p>Yesterday's conference had a large number of slogans, and the following are excerpts from a few: (1) The national people are fully mobilized, and unite to eliminate the Red Bandits; (1) The Red Bandits are traitors who collude with the Third International to sell out the nation; (1) To consolidate the country and improve the international status, we must first eliminate the Red Bandits who disrupt local security; (1) The army suppresses the Red Bandits in the front, and the people suppress the Red Bandits in the rear; (1) To overthrow imperialism, we must first eliminate the Red Bandits who collude with the Red and White imperialists; (1) The Red Bandits are murderers, arsonists, and executioners who massacre the people; (1) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang, long live the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Consolation Telegram</h3>
<p>After revisions, passed unanimously. The original text is recorded below: (1) Telegram of consolation to the officers and soldiers at the front suppressing bandits: "To Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of Nanchang, and all the generals and soldiers at the front: You have been personally braving arrows and stones for days, inspiring the officers and soldiers to fiercely suppress the Red bandits. Progress has been swift, and good news is frequently reported. It seems that the time to sweep away the bandits and have them surrender is not far off. Everyone is celebrating. We believe that the Red bandits have been wreaking havoc in the provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei for more than four years. The flames of their cruelty have turned homes into ruins. They have engaged in rape, plunder, arson, and inhumane acts. Although they have been attacked by large armies several times, they have repeatedly been suppressed and then allowed to recover, leading to a prairie fire-like situation that has become a threat to the heartland and shaken the foundations of the nation. People throughout the country are deeply worried about this. Now, fortunately, thanks to your tireless efforts and meticulous planning, an encirclement has been formed, and the time for annihilation is near. We hope that you will lead your generals and soldiers to quickly sweep away the bandit nests and strive to achieve complete victory, rescuing our compatriots from deep waters and fiery heat, and laying the foundation of the country on solid ground. Do not let our efforts be undone by a single mistake, leaving future troubles behind. All our citizens, in addition to assisting in the rear at all times, pledge to provide spiritual and material support to the generals and soldiers. We send this telegram of consolation and await good news." (2) Telegram to all compatriots: "To all newspapers, institutions, organizations, and compatriots at home and abroad: Since the suppression of the Communists in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], we have been striving to suppress rebellion year after year, leading to the secret growth of Red bandits in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and Jiangxi, harming the people and the country for four years now. The flames of their poison have burned everything. Homes have become ruins, fields have become wasteland, the old and weak have been abandoned in ditches, and the young and strong have been forced to join them. The intensity of their harm is greater than floods and fierce beasts. They even dare to take advantage of the Central Government's fierce battle against Japan to attack the rear, regardless of being internal collaborators, endangering the country. This is truly a heinous crime that angers both gods and men. Although the Central Government has repeatedly launched fierce suppression campaigns, the military has been focusing on the front lines, and the people have not been working hard in the rear, resulting in suppressing them here and allowing them to escape there, failing to achieve complete success. Now, fortunately, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally braves arrows and stones, inspects the bandit areas, and after much preparation, seeks rapid progress. An encirclement has been formed, and the time for annihilation is near. However, there is still something that this association cannot help but say. We believe that the reason why the Red bandits have been difficult to eliminate in the past is due to years of internal strife. The failure of the two anti-Japanese wars in Shanghai and North China is due to the constraints of the Red bandits. Therefore, internal conflicts do not cease, and the bandit problem is difficult to eradicate forever. If the bandit problem is not eradicated, foreign insults cannot be washed away. Now, the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, the international situation is becoming more urgent, and the great disaster of the future is just beginning. It is precisely the time for us to urgently seek to consolidate our internal affairs and strengthen our national foundation in order to cope with extraordinary events. All of us descendants of the Yellow Emperor should remember the lesson of the overturned nest, put aside our differences, take the overall situation into consideration, and ensure that the work of suppressing bandits does not encounter obstacles again. This is the first point. The Red bandits at the front are tangible. With the divine power of Chairman Chiang and the dedicated efforts of the generals and soldiers, it is not difficult to eliminate them. However, heretical ideas have spread widely, and intangible bandits are lurking everywhere. This cannot be ignored. Since the military is suppressing the bandits in front, how can our people sit idly by in the rear? We should unanimously expose the lurking bandit parties and correct the thinking of the youth, so that the intangible bandits can be eliminated at the same time. Then, we can achieve a permanent solution, and the country and the nation will benefit from it. This is the second point. At this time, the country has been facing many troubles for years, and the treasury is empty. The front-line provisions are sometimes difficult to sustain, which greatly affects morale. We hope that our countrymen will remember that suppressing the Red bandits is saving the country, and that the existence of bandits means the lack of me. With the determination that I and the bandits cannot coexist, we generously donate money and remotely provide support, so that the military's morale will be boosted and great success can be achieved. This is the third point. In the past, the Ming Dynasty did not perish at the hands of the Manchus, but at the hands of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong. Historical facts are there, and the lessons of the past are not far away. Today, the Red bandits' betrayal of the nation and the destruction of the country far exceeds that of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong. If this is not eliminated, what can be imagined of the future? All the citizens of Shanghai, fearing the imminent demise of the country, and based on the duty of every citizen, in addition to jointly detecting bandit parties and doing their best to donate money to encourage the military, we also hope that compatriots in various places will remember the importance of this bandit suppression, which is related to the survival of our country. We must rise up together, unite, and end disputes, and provide spiritual and material assistance to the front-line soldiers, jointly fulfill the duties of citizens, and achieve complete success in suppressing the Red bandits. Then, the future of the country and the nation will truly depend on it. We express our heartfelt words and hope for your consideration."</p>

<h3>The Yarn and Cloth Exchange Suspended the Auction of Term Yarn Yesterday - Following the Order of the Ministry to Refuse to Accept Newly Delivered Yarn - Brokers Request a Flexible Solution - Market Suspension for Three Days... Awaiting Further Instructions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange received an order from the Ministry of Industry to limit brokers to refuse to accept newly delivered cotton yarn from customers and manufacturers from yesterday to the end of this year. The order was sent by the Cotton Industry Control Association to the Ministry of Industry and forwarded to the exchange for compliance. The brokers were not prepared in advance, so those who were short-selling were panicked. An emergency meeting was held yesterday morning, and as a result, the exchange was asked to ask the Ministry to withdraw the order and give a flexible solution, requesting a reply within three days. As a result, the term yarn market was also suspended for three days yesterday. Bidding, flowers still continued to be auctioned, but because of the impact of cotton yarn, there was not much fluctuation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exchange Notice: The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange has received the telegram from the Shanghai Exchange Supervisor No. 124, which states: "The Ministry of Industry has approved the request of the Cotton Industry Control Association to stabilize yarn prices. The Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange should be ordered to refuse to accept newly delivered yarn from customers and manufacturers from November to the end of December this year, and to ensure compliance with the resolution of the general meeting of members of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association on July 8 this year." In response, the Cotton Industry Control Association has recently stated that the frequent decline in yarn prices has put Chinese manufacturers across the country in a difficult position. Under the current extraordinary circumstances, we must seek relief and request the Ministry of Industry to order our exchange to refuse to accept newly delivered yarn. Our exchange, upon receiving the above order, immediately submitted it to the 26th meeting of the fourth council for careful discussion. It was unanimously agreed that the government is adopting a control policy for the cotton yarn industry in order to save the domestic yarn industry. Under these globally depressed circumstances, all citizens should be of one mind and assist. Moreover, the Cotton Industry Control Association's proposal has considerable reasons for the relief of the yarn industry. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 169 of the Business Rules, it was resolved that from now until the end of December this year, all cotton yarn provided by the delivering brokers for delivery, except for those who already hold warehouse receipts and inspection certificates issued by our exchange, may still be provided for delivery. The delivering cotton yarn should first obtain a certificate from the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association authorizing the delivery to our exchange's own or designated warehouse for delivery, and then submit it to our exchange in accordance with the provisions of Article 99 of the Business Rules. Otherwise, our exchange will refuse to accept it in order to comply with the order of the Ministry. In addition to reporting this resolution to the exchange supervisor and submitting it to the Ministry of Industry, it is hereby announced for compliance. The Brokers Association also issued Notice No. 1669 yesterday to inform all brokers after the exchange's notice.</p>
<p>Council Meeting: The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange received the order from the Ministry of Industry on Saturday afternoon. At that time, the exchange considered the matter to be very important, and Chairman Mu Ouchu and others immediately convened an emergency council meeting to discuss it for a long time. As a result, a notice was posted after the market closed at 5 p.m. that afternoon. However, the brokers at the meeting had already dispersed and did not know about it. The next day happened to be a holiday, and the brokers did not see it either. When business opened yesterday, the brokers saw the notice and were extremely panicked.</p>
<p>Brokers' Attitude: Among the brokers, those who were long were not affected, but those who were short were greatly affected. Because these people were short-selling, they were prepared to purchase a large amount of cotton yarn from manufacturers so that they could deliver it to the exchange. Now that the exchange has refused to accept newly delivered yarn, these brokers will have nowhere to sell the cotton yarn they have purchased. If they deliver cash instead, the cotton yarn market will rise sharply, resulting in significant losses. As for the cotton yarn manufacturers, although they can profit from the rise in market prices, they are still launching in the spot market. The brokers of the exchange convened an emergency meeting at the exchange at 9:30 a.m. yesterday to discuss the countermeasures to this matter. At that time, senior officials of the exchange also attended. As a result of the meeting, the exchange was asked to ask the Ministry of Industry to withdraw the order immediately or extend the reduction time and requested a reply within three days. It is heard that the exchange has already submitted it to the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market: After this incident, cotton yarn trading was suspended yesterday. The exchange issued a notice stating that the cotton yarn exchange will be suspended for three days from the 6th of this month, and cotton trading will continue as usual. In addition to notifying the Brokers Association, it is hereby announced. Although there was cotton trading in the afternoon, the market price difference was only about 10 cents, and there were few transactions.</p>
<h3>Jiang Feng Machine Returned to Shanghai Yesterday - Reinstalling the Landing Wheel - Test Flight in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>The Jiang Feng machine, manufactured by the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, left Tianshenggang at 11:35 a.m. yesterday, still piloted by Ninghai Aviation Instructor Xu Chengqi. Ma Shude, an engineer from the office who had gone to Tongzhou a few days ago, also returned to Shanghai. It arrived safely in Shanghai at 12:30 p.m. and landed on the river in front of the office. All the staff of the office and Director Zeng personally went to the airport to welcome them.</p>
<h3>The Grand Occasion in Tongzhou</h3>
<p>According to Instructor Xu and Engineer Ma, when they arrived in Tongzhou the day before, no less than 1,000 representatives from the Nantong County Party Department, the County Government, and various mass organizations came to the Dada Wharf in Tianshenggang to welcome them. Due to the large number of people, the Wanxing boat bridge at the wharf was broken. Fortunately, no tragic drowning occurred. They then circled and flew in the sky above the area without scattering leaflets. They originally planned to return to Shanghai the day before, but because of the bad weather, and especially the bad weather near Shanghai, they were unable to fly to Shanghai. At noon, various organizations in the area held a public banquet at the club, and in the afternoon, they gave a lecture at the Ai Ren Hospital. They stayed at the club that day and left Tianshenggang yesterday morning to return to Shanghai. The people there hope to donate money to order locally made machines for national salvation.</p>
<h3>Reinstalling the Wheel</h3>
<p>After the Jiang Feng machine returned to Shanghai, it is now engaged in reinstalling the landing wheel and will be completed in about two weeks. Then, a land and air test flight and performance will be held at the Hongqiao Airport. The time to fly to South China has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>The Five National Goods Organizations Hosted Various Sectors Yesterday Afternoon: Appealing to the Public and Legal Communities for a Fair Ruling on the San Shan Guild's Obstruction of National Goods Entering Fujian</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical National Goods United Association, the Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, and the Chinese National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association held a reception yesterday afternoon at the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA for the local press and various legal entities related to national goods due to the San Shan Fuling Guild's obstruction of national goods to Fujian. Approximately one hundred journalists and guests from all walks of life attended. First, Du Chongyuan, the general director of the National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, represented the presidium and delivered an opening speech, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, today</p>
<p>the Shanghai National Goods Factories United Association, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Mechanical National Goods Factories United Association, and the Chinese National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, five national goods organizations, are jointly hosting you gentlemen from the press. Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Mr. Yan Esheng from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Zhu Boyuan from the Commodity Exhibition Hall, Mr. Wu Huanru from the Social Affairs Bureau, Mr. Huang Renzhi from the National Goods Department of the Local Association, and Mr. Qian Chengxu from the Chinese General Industry Federation, thank you for sacrificing your valuable time to grace this gathering. We are truly honored. I would like to first represent the five organizations to express our welcome. These five national goods organizations stand together in promoting national goods. Currently, on the path of promoting national goods, we have encountered a major obstacle. Speaking of it, it is truly a heartbreaking and unfortunate matter. I believe that many of you have already fully understood this matter before I explain it. However, in order to clarify the truth and allow society to understand the cause and effect of this incident, I would like to take this opportunity to explain it in detail. In March of this year, the National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, in order to be true to its name and further promote national goods, established a National Goods Introduction Center on Yuanmingyuan Road in this city and successively established branch introduction centers in major commercial ports in China. Its sole business is to introduce Shanghai's national goods to various provinces in the interior and to introduce the national goods and local products of various provinces to Shanghai, as well as to circulate them to various places. It was approved and registered by the Ministry of Industry in May and received a subsidy from the Economic Committee. Therefore, the nature of this office is purely a service organization. Although it is in the position of intermediary between buyers and sellers, it never squeezes money from manufacturers and merchants in other ports during the transfer, so that merchants in various ports can obtain cheap national goods with extremely convenient procedures, and local specialties, raw materials, and mechanical national goods can all be circulated. After its establishment, branch offices were established successively in various inland areas, such as Chongqing, Shantou, Guangzhou, Hankou, Fuzhou, etc., and the progress was very smooth. However, the situation in Fuzhou is unique. Because the local shopkeepers have established the San Shan Guild in Shanghai, which specializes in manipulating the prices of goods going from Shanghai to Fuzhou. All goods going from Shanghai must be approved by the guild before they can be loaded, and when the guild approves the loading, it must be subject to a layer of exploitation, euphemistically called 'incense money.' This illegal procedure has been in place for many years, and has become a chronic problem that no one dares to resist. When our office was established, they were immediately uneasy. Later, they disregarded everything and set up various destructive measures. Now, I will briefly report on the number of times and the circumstances in which the guild obstructed the transportation of goods. The first time they stopped military goods. On September 21st of this year, the National Goods Introduction Center used the Jardine Shipping Bureau's Jiesheng Wheel to ship sixteen pieces of cloth to the Fuzhou Introduction Branch, which were declared by the Yongshengtai Customs Brokerage. Prior to this, the guild had warned the Jardine, Sanbei, Changan, China Merchants, and various customs brokerages that travel to and from Fuzhou that they must not declare customs and load goods on behalf of the introduction center. Otherwise, the Fuzhou shopkeepers will permanently not entrust the business of customs declaration and shipping to the relevant firms and shipping bureaus. Because the Fuzhou shopkeepers are powerful, if they violate their wishes, the business will have to be suspended. Therefore, they all bowed their heads and obeyed. Unexpectedly, the Jiesheng Wheel failed to notice that day and mistakenly shipped the goods of the introduction center. It was not until the ship had left Shanghai that the guild's investigators discovered it. Therefore, they pursued the original customs brokerage and ordered them to issue a statement to the Jardine Shipping Bureau that the goods should not be picked up by the consignee when they arrived in Fuzhou and should still be shipped back with the ship. The customs brokerage, fearing their power, complied with their request. As a result, although the goods arrived in Fuzhou, they were detained and not delivered. Later, the Fuzhou Introduction Branch repeatedly telegraphed the Shanghai General Office to inquire. After the General Office made great efforts to dredge relations with the guild, it took several twists and turns before they agreed to allow the delivery. The second time they stopped the transportation of goods. On October 23rd, the National Goods Introduction Center entrusted the Sanbei Company Shipping Bureau to ship 131 pieces of cloth goods to Fuzhou, and they agreed to transport them. Later, the bureau was influenced by the San Shan Guild.</p>
<p>When the introduction center went to sign [the agreement], the recorder said that unless allowed by the San Shan Guild, they could not transport [the goods], and so on. Helplessly, the goods had to be temporarily transported by the China Merchants Bureau's Tai [something] Wheel. The bureau originally had the nature of [being fair], and did not use the reason of being busy to refuse transportation. Therefore, the goods of the introduction center were able to be exported. However, the China Merchants Bureau, because it transported goods for the introduction center, incurred the wrath of the San Shan Guild. The Fuzhou shopkeepers were incited to return all the goods that had been declared to be transported to Fuzhou by the bureau and to transfer them to other ships. The China Merchants Bureau, in order to maintain the transportation of national goods, caused this voyage to Fuzhou to be virtually an empty ship, except for the goods of the introduction center, sacrificing shipping costs to a considerable extent. Regarding this incident, the introduction center not only expressed boundless admiration for the China Merchants Bureau, but was also deeply astonished at the manipulation and control of the Fuzhou shopkeepers and their intentions. Summarizing, their means of obstructing the transportation of goods are to first coerce the customs brokerage not to declare customs for the national goods of our office, and then to coerce the shipping companies not to ship them. Foreign shipping companies take business as their premise and have no perception of the term national goods. Because they are afraid of the power of the guild, they do not allow the National Goods Introduction Center to load goods. The guild was originally an organization that united the Chinese people to deal with foreigners, so our office did not argue with the guild even if it was unreasonable, hoping that it would eventually realize its mistake. However, the guild became complacent and became more and more aggressive, and then coerced the Sanbei and China Merchants, two domestic shipping companies, to refuse to load goods. As a result, although the Sanbei Company agreed to load goods on behalf of our office, it was ultimately succumbed to the evil forces and accepted their unreasonable demands. Only the persons in charge of China Merchants had a clear understanding of justice and regarded this dark force as contrary to legal principles, and resolutely refused to accept it. At this point, the San Shan Guild should have repented and realized its mistake, but instead, it intensified its efforts and completely returned the goods that had been scheduled to be loaded on the China Merchants Bureau to show its resistance. The China Merchants Bureau, in order to uphold justice, suffered great losses in business. Our association could not bear it any longer and announced the facts in the newspapers. However, the intention of our association is still to hope that under the serious accusations of society, it will immediately repent and does not intend to eliminate the guild and make it disappear. However, the guild was so ashamed that it turned to anger and spread rumors in the newspapers for days to confuse the public. Such behavior of the guild is already unreasonable. Therefore, our national goods colleagues have risen up together to remove this scourge in order to eliminate the obstacles to the future of national goods. Therefore, today, we invite the press and legal entities related to national goods to gather together and explain the truth based on the facts, and ask the press and various agencies and legal entities to make a fair judgment. This is what our association and colleagues hope for most." Then, Mr. Qian Chengxu spoke, saying, "The main reason for this incident is the conflict in principle between the Production and Sales Cooperation Association and the San Shan Guild. The purpose of the Production and Sales Cooperation Association is to reduce the burden of purchasing for the people, while the San Shan Guild, in addition to adding a layer of exploitation when purchasing goods on behalf of buyers and sellers, also has to collect incense money. This matter is extremely harmful to the future of national goods promotion and should be given full attention by all sectors of society," and so on. Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, said, "According to reason, this rash action of the San Shan Guild is really a bit unreasonable. Because at this time, we should no longer value our own private interests, but should prioritize the interests of the public. Regarding this dispute, I believe that all legal entities should be convened together with the San Shan Guild to discuss it publicly in person, which is the proper way to resolve it." Mr. Xu Zhuodai said, "This matter should be regarded as a conflict between the San Shan Guild and the government, and a conflict with the people of Fujian. This incident must at least make the people of Fujian feel that our efforts and struggles are to relieve their purchasing burden." Mr. Qian Cangshuo said, "In today's society, most people should have food to eat, and a small number of people should not be exclusively full. The Chinese National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association is protecting the rice bowls of the majority, while sacrificing the rice bowls of the people in the San Shan Guild. We cannot but express our deep sympathy to the association." Mr. Sun Daosheng said, "Since the establishment of various national goods organizations, they have not encountered any blows. This is the first time we have discovered it. We should uphold justice and make the truth clear to the world." Mr. Ji Jiannan, the representative of the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, said, "The invasion of foreign powers is rooted in the imperfection of our own organization. Various legal entities in our national goods sector should unite to form a committee to discuss and deal with matters together. This committee should be a permanent institution." Then, Wu Huanru from the Social Affairs Bureau and guests from all walks of life gave speeches one after another. Finally, Chairman Du Chongyuan delivered a solemn reply, saying, "The establishment of the association is purely for external affairs. As for internal problems, there is nothing that cannot be resolved. I am very grateful for the encouragement from guests from all walks of life and the public opinion sector. However, the motive for resolving the problem lies with the San Shan Guild. Our association will never engage in meaningless disputes and scold each other if there is a way to go. However, we are now forced to do so. Therefore, even if foreigners laugh at us and the Chinese people are heartbroken, it is unavoidable. However, if there is a way to resolve it peacefully, our association is willing to accept it sincerely. I would like to reiterate this intention to all guests on behalf of various national goods legal entities. I hope you will understand." The meeting ended at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association received a letter from the San Shan Fuling Guild on the 4th of this month, which falsely accused the association of monopolizing the market and hindering national goods, citing the case of Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory's handling of goods as proof. The truth of the facts is refuted as follows: It is found that the association previously sent a letter to the Fuzhou Introduction Branch stating, "Renfeng Factory's Renshou Bleached Cloth is rumored not to be national goods. Since our association is established to serve the national goods sector, we must be cautious in purchasing goods from non-member factories, so it has not been processed." The above statements are completely based on the facts of the matter. Before the member factories of the association join the association, they have all undergone meticulous investigation, and the goods produced are indeed national goods, so there is no need to go through procedures when purchasing goods, which is very convenient. When purchasing goods from non-member factories, for the sake of the association's own reputation, it is necessary to be cautious to avoid mixing fish eyes with pearls and hindering the progress of the national goods business. The so-called caution means that it must be investigated and proved that the product is indeed national goods before it can be processed, and it is not a rejection. See the association's letter to the Fuzhou Branch on June 19, "Renfeng Factory was previously falsely accused by rumors of not being a national goods factory. After a detailed investigation, it is not the case," which is sufficient to show the association's cautious attitude towards national goods. How can the guild use this as an excuse to wantonly provoke discord? Moreover, the dispute between the association and the guild is only about the issue of obstructing transportation. Now the guild attributes the issue of obstructing transportation to self-defense and avoids responding, talking about other things and going beyond the scope. The association originally did not want to waste ink on this trivial matter, but it is afraid that the world will not know or misunderstand, so it must make another statement. Please bother to check and publish it, thank you. Chinese National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Advisor, Donald, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Visited Song Ziwen for Talks After Landing</h3>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reported that Mr. Donald, advisor to Zhang Xueliang, former Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, traveled to Europe with Zhang and others in April of this year. Mr. Donald arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. on the Italian ship Conte Verde. After landing, Donald went to Song Ziwen's residence on Qiqi Road to visit Song and talked for about an hour. He left at half past three. Subsequently, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited him at his residence, and Mr. Donald gave the following statement:</p>
<h3>No Mission</h3>
<p>Donald said that he separated from Zhang Xueliang in Paris on October 4 and came to Shanghai, arriving here today (i.e., yesterday). When he departed from Europe, Zhang also left Paris the next day and transferred to London. Zhang is probably still residing in England. He came here without any mission and will not go to Nanjing or Beiping. As for whether or when he will return to Europe, it is still undecided.</p>
<h3>Zhang Studies Aviation</h3>
<p>When the reporter asked Donald about Zhang's recent situation and whether he intended to return to China, Donald replied that Zhang has been able to work hard on various tasks recently. Whether he will return to China is currently unknown. However, according to Zhang's personal intentions, he is very willing to return to China. At the same time, Zhang's former subordinates and others all hope that he will return to China. However, due to various reasons, it is feared that it cannot be realized in fact. Therefore, the matter of returning to China is not only unknown to me, but even he himself does not know when he can return to China. However, Zhang will leave Europe within his possible scope. When I bid farewell to Zhang, Zhang once said to me, "If I (Zhang referring to himself) do not return to China, I will decide to study aviation." Therefore, Zhang is currently very interested in studying aviation.</p>

<p>As for the saying that Zhang will go to Soviet Russia for the winter, I have not heard of this matter. However, as far as I know, Zhang plans to go to Soviet Russia and Turkey to inspect. Currently, Zhang is very welcomed by the authorities in various countries he has visited in Europe.</p>

<p>Jeweler Yang Shousheng Kidnapped; Kidnappers Calm and Composed, Passersby Unaware; Car Used by Kidnappers Rented from Japanese Car Dealership; Original Car Discovered After Hitting a Rickshaw; Clues to the Case Already Emerging, All Parties Cooperating in the Investigation</p>
<p>At 6:20 p.m. yesterday, a kidnapping case occurred in the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct of the First District in the Chenghuangmiao area of the city. Afterwards, the kidnappers' car hit a rickshaw in the French Concession and was stopped by the police. In a panic, they abandoned the car and fled. The rickshaw puller was forced to get out of the car on Columbia Road, Anhe Temple Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Two Men Ambushed</h3>
<p>Yang Shousheng, a jeweler from Suzhou, 55 years old, lives at No. 4 Xiguangqi Road, Chenghuangmiao, [something] in the city. He has been in the jewelry business for decades and has accumulated considerable private savings. Unexpectedly, he has aroused the covetousness of kidnappers. However, Yang is also quite vigilant, so the gates of the house are very strict. Family members enter and exit through the back door in the alley near Huacaobang, and Yang himself does the same. Yang goes out at around 10 a.m. every day and returns home at around 6 p.m. Yesterday, at around 6:20 p.m., Yang finished his business and returned home by car. When he walked into the back door alley, he was suddenly hijacked into the car by two men who had been ambushing in the alley and kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Expelled</h3>
<p>At around 5 p.m. yesterday, three Chinese men suddenly came to the Morimura Car Dealership operated by a Japanese in the vegetable market near the Hongkou Triangle and said they wanted to hire a car to Jing'an Temple Road. The dealership immediately ordered the driver, Wu Baogen, 25 years old, a local, to drive the Concession Permit No. 18066. After arriving at Jing'an Temple, the three men in the car suddenly ordered the driver to drive to Columbia Road. The driver immediately obeyed and drove there. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at Columbia Road, Anhe Temple Road, the three men behind the driver suddenly tied the driver's eyes with cloth, ordered him to stop, and tied his hands and feet with rope. They dragged him out of the car and abandoned him on the side of the road. The bandits then drove the car away themselves.</p>
<h3>Yang Struggles in the Car</h3>
<p>When Yang Shousheng was kidnapped, there were many pedestrians on the road, but the bandits' actions were calm and composed, so they were not discovered. When the bandits hijacked Yang to Fangbang Road and helped him onto the car that was pre-parked there, he was discovered by acquaintances. They saw that Yang was struggling and that the two men next to him were hiding pistols in their sleeves, so they knew that he had been kidnapped. At first, they wanted to shout, but they were afraid of endangering Yang's life, so they quickly went to the back of the car, remembered the car's Concession Permit number, 18066, and ran to the nearby police station to report. They immediately reported to the General Bureau, and Wen Bichang ordered all the detectives, Ren Shouzhi, and others to search everywhere. On one side, Yang's family also received the news and reported to various agencies, requesting assistance.</p>
<h3>Driver's Report</h3>
<p>At around 6:45 p.m., the driver of car No. 18066 suddenly walked to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station in the Public Concession and reported that he had been tied up and driven off the car. He requested that the dealership be notified. He asked to investigate the whereabouts of the car. After receiving the report, the police station immediately sent detectives Jin Yangwu and others to Columbia Road to investigate. At the same time, they notified all police stations to cooperate in the search. Not long after, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau notified the documents of the kidnapping case, and detectives also arrived at the police station. Only then did they learn that the car was actually rented by the kidnappers and immediately sent more detectives to search everywhere. On one side, the French police also received the above documents and sent detectives to investigate.</p>
<h3>Car Found</h3>
<p>At around 9:45 p.m., a car suddenly came speeding from west to east on Fuli Road in the French Concession. However, because there were various cars passing by on the north and south sides, it could not move forward. However, the car's momentum was very strong, and it could not brake in time. Fearing an accident, the driver of the car urgently turned the car onto the sidewalk. Unexpectedly, a rickshaw was in front at that time, so it actually overturned the rickshaw. Seeing that he had caused an accident, the driver got out of the car and fled. The police chased after him, but it was too late. When they looked back at the car, what appeared in their eyes was Concession Permit No. 18066.</p>
<h3>Clues Already Emerging</h3>
<p>At that time, the police did not know that this car was related to the kidnapping case. Because there was no one driving, they took the car to the Lujiawan Police Station. Because the car was actually found, they immediately detained it and notified the Public Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. On one side, they notified the owner of the Morimura Car Dealership to go to identify it and inspect the remains in the car in order to investigate. The driver, Wu Baogen, was temporarily detained at the Jing'an Temple Police Station. After interrogation by the police chief, they thought that there were many doubts. Later, they learned that the Public Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the French Concession, three agencies, had considerable clues about this case and were about to cooperate in the arrest. Because the car was detained at the French Police Station, the driver, Wu Baogen, was transferred from the Jing'an Temple Police Station to the French Concession for handling at 11:50 p.m. that night.</p>
<h3>Xinfeng Steamer Damages Jin Liyuan Wharf; Careless Accident During Entry; Pier No. 9 Suffers Losses; Side Penetrates Fifteen Feet; Two Pontoon Bridges Destroyed and Fallen</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's regular Northern Route steamer Xinfeng, this time on its return to Shanghai from Tianjin, first collided with a Swire barge in the Baihe River, then ran aground. When it arrived at Yantai, it collided with the wharf again, and the hull was slightly damaged. When it arrived in Shanghai, it carelessly rammed into Pier No. 9 of Jin Liyuan, damaging it and destroying two pontoon bridges. The losses were huge. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Two Accidents En Route</h3>
<p>Xinfeng and Xinming are regular steamers of the China Merchants Bureau. Therefore, the bureau has always assigned senior captains with the most qualifications to serve as captains. Recently, the original captain was appointed as a Tianjin harbor pilot, and the bureau sent the first mate, Qian Yujia, to act as the captain, working in Tianjin. In the Baihe River, it first collided with a Swire barge, and then ran aground. On the way back from Tianjin, when the ship arrived at Yantai, it collided with the wharf due to careless work. The hull of the Xinfeng was immediately damaged. After being repaired with cement and other materials, it sailed to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when entering the port, it rammed into the Jin Liyuan Wharf.</p>
<h3>Damages Pier Upon Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Xinfeng steamer arrived in Shanghai at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday. At that time, it was gradually getting dark, and the ship arrived in front of Pier No. 5 of Nan Liyuan, and the slow car was gradually turned on as usual, and it could be docked. At that time, it was also at the top of the ebb tide, and it would not be dangerous. It was even more convenient to berth. However, when the Xinfeng ship arrived at Pier No. 9, it wanted to bring the [something] close, and its bow suddenly pressed against the top of Pier No. 9. At this time, the ship had not stopped. The bow of the Xinfeng naturally opened into the pier. Seeing this situation, First Mate Sun [something] was afraid of causing a huge disaster that would destroy the entire pier and the bow would directly hit the land. He urgently took a large anchor and threw it to the left to block the forward force of the Xinfeng. Otherwise, the Xinfeng would have rushed directly to the shore.</p>
<h3>華壽里重開水管工部局主張公理正義　市政府派負調查援助</h3>
<p>The water pipes have been reopened at Huashou Lane. The Public Works Department upholds principles of justice and fairness, and the Municipal Government sends personnel to investigate and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Hongkou Zhoushan Road's Huashou Lane faced a dispute over house demolitions. After the tenants' self-governing association submitted petitions, the Shanghai Municipal Government dispatched officials to conduct on-site investigations. According to the municipal government, they will provide sympathetic assistance to the best of their ability. Furthermore, the landlord, Siekebo &amp; Co., had previously requested the water company to shut off the water supply to the lane. However, with the vigorous assistance of the Public Works Department, the water company was instructed to install a separate water meter. Yesterday, the tenants pooled together 250 yuan and submitted it to the Public Works Department to be forwarded to the water company as a deposit for the water meter. As a result, the lane officially began using the new water meter yesterday. The general tenants repeatedly praised the Public Works Department's advocacy of justice and fairness.</p>
<p>國人自營酒精業之大計劃</p>
<p>A grand plan for Chinese to operate their own alcohol industry.</p>
<p>Shanghai merchants Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Xue Zehao, Chen Baifan, and others previously initiated a joint venture with the Ministry of Industry to establish the China Industrial Alcohol Factory. This was proposed by Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo at the 91st Administrative Conference and legally approved. Just as the factory was about to be established, Huang Jiangquan, a British Indian overseas Chinese, requested to join the partnership. However, due to disagreements over the terms of cooperation, Huang separately negotiated with the Ministry of Industry and obtained special permission from Minister Chen. As a result, a second contract for a jointly operated alcohol factory was signed. However, this factory is large-scale, and its establishment is still far off. Therefore, the China factory is still actively preparing to commence operations. The original initiators also partnered with Tianjin Zhongyuan Company to produce alcohol from sorghum in Tianjin, with a capital of 200,000 yuan, which will be exclusively sold in North China. They also jointly established an alcohol factory in Hong Kong with Situ Bojun, an overseas Chinese from Little Luzon, using dregs as raw material, with a capital of 500,000 Hong Kong dollars, which will be exclusively promoted in South China. The three factories will coordinate with each other and start operations simultaneously. It is decided that they will commence operations within five months, working day and night, with a projected total daily output of 8,000 English gallons of alcohol. All plans are the sole responsibility of Xue Jun.</p>

<p>蘇俄在滬購軍需品</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Purchases Military Supplies in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Soviet Union's military operations against Manchuria are becoming increasingly blatant. Recently, its commercial agency in Tokyo secretly purchased cement for the purpose of building trenches, but it was stopped by the Japanese military police. Therefore, it turned to commercial agencies in Shanghai. It is reported that the local Russian commercial agencies have received urgent instructions from Ingosstrakh to purchase large quantities of cement and sanitary clothing, as well as other cold-weather materials. In addition, a contract was signed with a certain company for 6 million yards of cotton, to be delivered within one month. Furthermore, there are urgent purchases of cotton and other military supplies in Tianjin. Recently, Soviet ships have been traveling frequently between Vladivostok and Shanghai. All cargo ships of the Far East merchant fleet have been fully mobilized to undertake transportation. It is said that the date of the Soviet-Manchurian war will be when these military supplies and materials are purchased.</p>

<p>T.V. Soong, a standing committee member of the Economic Committee, has been staying in Shanghai since resigning from the positions of Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance.

<p>屈文六報告Ｌ]沽源寳昌放賑艱危　雪地冰溝車陷不相顧　匪巢深入改途免敎機</p>
<p>Qu Wenliu Reports on the Difficulties of Disaster Relief in Guyuan and Baochang: Vehicles Stuck in Snow and Ice Ditches, Unable to Help Each Other; Deep into Bandit Dens, Changing Routes to Avoid Capture</p>
<p>Qu Wenliu, a standing director of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees, personally went to the disaster areas of Chahar, Guyuan, Baochang, Kangbao, and other counties to investigate and provide relief due to the severity of the disaster. The journey was extremely difficult, beyond description in words, demonstrating his enthusiasm, perseverance, and resilience, truly living up to the mission of the charity organizations. The following is an excerpt from his telegram reporting the situation:</p>
<p>(1) On October 22nd, the journey from Zhangjiakou to Guyuan was only 180 miles, expected to be reached in half a day. However, the road was filled with wind and snow, and the vehicles repeatedly went astray. Snow and ice ditches often became traps. By evening, the three vehicles were separated and trapped in snow cellars, unable to help each other. The vehicle Qu was riding in was 20 miles from Guyuan County, trapped in a snow ditch, and three hours of manpower could not get it out of danger. The other two vehicles had not arrived and were unknown where they were trapped. As night fell, the snow became thicker and the ice became harder, making it impossible to struggle out. Fortunately, there were newly returned residents in Erdaoying nearby, so they knocked on the door and entered. There were originally dozens of households there, but they had all died of starvation over the years. They first entered a courtyard of about ten acres, but less than one-tenth of it had doors, windows, and roofs. They borrowed a room for a temporary rest. All the food was in the other two vehicles, and they could not get a thin drink from breakfast until late at night. The colleagues were very hungry and afraid of bandits. More than a dozen Zhenyou and guards were on alert until dawn. In the morning, they勉强抬出將汽車 from the snow ditch, but the wheels were bound by ice and could not move. They had to heat the ice with fire and push the vehicle. Fortunately, the wind was calm and the snow stopped that day. After 9:00 AM, the other two vehicles also arrived, and they proceeded to the county seat.</p>
<p>(2) On October 31st, on the road from Guyuan to Baochang, the guide was not good, and they almost went deep into a bandit den. They were first trapped in a swamp and spent two hours getting out of danger. It was already dusk, and the bandits could easily carry out robberies. Fortunately, they became aware and hired another guide, changing their route. When the bandits realized, they detoured to intercept, but the vehicles were already ahead of the bandits. The bandits fired several shots, but none hit, and they were spared from disaster. The county has been repeatedly ravaged by soldiers and bandits, resulting in extreme hardship. He has already started an investigation and will go to Kangbao after the investigation is completed.</p>
<p>爲國犧牲之留印佛敎徒黄松林在希臘自盡　王一亭葉恭綽等周恤家屬　歐籍佛敎徒係其介紹來華</p>
<p>Huang Songlin, a Buddhist who studied in India and sacrificed himself for the country, committed suicide in Greece; Wang Yiting, Ye Gongchuo, and others provide relief to his family; European Buddhists were introduced to China by him</p>
<p>Huang Songlin, a Buddhist follower in Shanghai, had a deep understanding of Buddhist studies and was well-versed in English, French, and German literature. Buddhist organizations in Shanghai, such as the Jingye Society, under the leadership of Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Yiting, and others, believed that Indian Buddhist studies had a close relationship with Chinese culture. Therefore, they raised funds of 80 yuan per month and sent Mr. Huang to study in India. For the past two years, he has been reporting on the state of Indian Buddhist studies and has introduced 14 European Buddhists, including Zhao Kong, to China. He also translated the Sixth Patriarch's Platform Sutra into English and sent it to various countries for promotion. According to a reporter from the Heping News Agency, Mr. Huang, deeply concerned about the severity of China's national crisis and the fact that the Chinese people were still not aware of it, and were still fighting for power, committed suicide in a clear stream in Greece out of despair. He also sent a letter to the Chinese people, earnestly exhorting them. Ye Gongchuo, Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Yiting, and others, recognizing that Mr. Huang's family was poor and his wife and children were young, immediately raised 2,500 yuan to provide for his family and plan to hold a memorial service at a later date.</p>

<p>長興煤鑛擴充工程</p>
<p>Expansion Project of Changxing Coal Mine</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Changxing Coal Mine was transferred to commercial operation by the Construction Committee last October, its business has been developing well. The daily output has also increased slightly compared to before. However, since the dumping of foreign coal, the selling price has decreased, resulting in minor losses. With its rich deposits, the mine can be called the best mine in the South. Unfortunately, the scope of the project is too small, preventing the full development of this excellent source of profit. Recognizing this, the company decided to raise a large amount of capital to vigorously develop the mine. It is reported that the British Fu Company has paid close attention to the mine and sent its chief engineer to conduct an on-site inspection, the results of which were very satisfactory. After earnest negotiations between the company and Mr. Beda, the general manager of the Fu Company, the Fu Company has agreed to advance 2 million yuan for the expansion project. As for the terms of the loan, it is entirely a credit investment. The company has consulted the Ministry of Industry in advance regarding borrowing funds from the Fu Company and submitted the draft contract for review. The Ministry of Industry, finding that the draft loan contract did not conflict with the Mining Law, has approved it. The two parties are currently negotiating the formal contract, which will be finalized soon.</p>

<p>Xie Hengchuang, the owner of Yuchang Coal Shop, previously needed capital turnover and mortgaged warehouse receipts for goods to the Salt Industry Bank for a large sum of money. Later, Xie secretly sold the goods during the mortgage period. After the Salt Industry Bank found out, its manager, Chen Zheqing, negotiated with Xie, pointing out that Xie was a respected figure in the Shanghai business community and should not have taken such irregular actions. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a theft lawsuit against Xie, requesting legal punishment and seeking compensation for the mortgage amount. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Xiangzu of the First Special District Local Court opened the court to summon the defendant Xie Hengchuang, who did not appear. According to his defense lawyer, Xie is a director of Bao Pu Company and has gone to Nanjing for the company's registration matters, so he requested a postponement. Judge Wu then instructed the plaintiff's lawyer to temporarily refrain from stating the prosecution's intentions and approved a postponement for another hearing on the afternoon of November 20th.</p>
<p>槍殺嚴阿章之兇犯陳芹喜就逮</p>
<p>The Murderer Chen Qinxi, Who Shot Yan Azhang, Is Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Qinxi, also known as Chen Xi, a native of Ningbo, 25 years old, colluded with Xiang Xiasheng, also from Ningbo, who has already been arrested and sentenced to three years in prison, and Zhang Qi, A Hua, Xiao Biao, and two others still at large, to lure fellow townsman Yan Azhang to a remote area on Guiyang Road on the evening of August 22nd at 9:15 PM, where they shot and injured him in a vital area and pushed him into a nearby canal. He was found by detectives and sent to the hospital for treatment, but died due to his injuries. At 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Su Changsheng and Detective Inspector Xie Wanfang of the Yulin Road Police Station arrested Chen on Yuezhou Road and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday afternoon, Police Barrister Zhang Tianyin stated the background of the case to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, stating that the investigation revealed that the fugitives A Hua, Zhang Qi, and Xiang Xiasheng had gathered at No. 6 Huishan Road, where the defendant previously resided, to discuss and decide to lure Yan Azhang out of the Shanghai Third Cotton Mill at No. 523 Yangshupu Road with the help of Xiao Biao. Xiao Biao led the way, Zhang Qi and Yan were in the middle, and A Hua, Xiang Xiasheng, and the defendant were behind, surrounding Yan to prevent him from escaping. A Hua then confronted Yan because Yan had previously borrowed a pistol and used it to rob a certain family's property at No. 34 Changanli, Yangshupu Road, and had not returned it afterward. When Yan asked for it back, they argued and threatened to report it to the police. This was overheard, so they used the gun to shoot Yan, who fell to the ground, but did not die. Zhang Qi then kicked Yan several times and pushed him into the hole, hoping he would die quickly. The others took the opportunity to escape. However, Yan was found by detectives and rescued. He was able to speak and identify the names of the murderers, stating that A Hua and the defendant demanded 30 silver dollars, which Yan refused, and A Hua then shot him. These were the facts of the case. Now, the convicted offender Xiang Xiasheng was also brought in for questioning. According to Xiang, he used to live on Amherst Avenue and worked as a sand turner with the deceased. At that time, the deceased invited him to Yangshupu for fun with the defendant A Hua, Xiao Biao, and others. When they reached a remote area in Gao Lang Miao Township, A Hua took out a gun and shot the deceased, who immediately fell to the ground. Seeing the trouble, he fled. The defendant供述供述: He knew Yan for only a month. He worked with him as a sand turner and had no grudges against him. He knew that A Hua had borrowed a gun from Yan and had not returned it. Later, he said to Zhang Qi that if he swallowed the gun, he would report it to the police. He and A Hua and five others were planning to go to Jiangwan for a walk. When they reached a remote area of Guiyang Road, this disaster occurred. He then fled. The rest of his供述支吾。 Judge Xiao Xiefen核供述核供述核供述, ordered him to be detained and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<p>Gold Price Drops Slightly by $1.30; Worsening News Drives Price to $743.80; Foreign Firms Settle Accounts, Major Players Hasten to Cover, Price Rises by $10.00</p>
<p>The gold market experienced a decline followed by a recovery yesterday. Major players aggressively covered their positions, ultimately reversing the slight weakening sentiment from last Saturday. The market's resilience was also influenced by the impending closure for the Autumn and Spring holidays. The morning began with gains in overseas silver markets in both London and New York. The forward silver price on the metals exchange rose by varying amounts, from 3.5% to 5%. Exchange rates continued to climb, exceeding $4.86. London spot gold fell by 9.5 pence. The U.S. government's purchase of newly mined gold was priced at $32.67, a further increase of $0.10. Stock prices for U.S. cotton and wheat rose slightly. Reports indicated that the U.S. government had successfully lowered the value of the gold dollar, achieving near parity with the British pound. Domestically, there was strong belief in the government's gold purchasing policy to raise commodity prices, and all withdrawals were rejected pending the outcome of this policy. News seemed to weigh on sentiment, with initial offers falling to $46 or $47. After the opening, the market still declined to $743.80 due to stiff domestic demand, marking a new low. Later, the foreign exchange market strengthened as banks showed a strong appetite and importers rushed to settle accounts. Major players in the market actively covered their positions, leading to a firm and brisk market. Prices gradually rose above $50, slightly higher than the closing price last Saturday, rebounding by more than $10. Banks took advantage of higher prices to supply gold. The half-day closing was relatively flat. While news of a $2 million loan to American farmers was received, its impact was minimal. Standard gold was priced at $1,120. The market situation for the first half of the day is detailed below.</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning at $747.30, down $6.80 from last Saturday. Goods opened at $6.70. The initial foreign exchange market showed near-term prices of 1 shilling 3 pence at 6.875 for British exchange, and $31.875 for U.S. exchange. Heng Yu, Chun Yuan, Yong Fu, Chang Da Xing, Yong Rui, and Kang, among others, offered gold at the opening. While Fu Yu participated, they gradually lowered their bids from $7.50 to $3.80. U.S. dollars for March delivery were difficult to sell at $8.125. Sassoon aggressively sold U.S. dollars for February delivery at $6.875. Mercantile bought U.S. dollars for March delivery at $0.875. Banks bought February deliveries at $6.875, hovering around the $5 mark. Heng Xing, Ri Chang, Yuan Heng, and Wan Xing continued to sell. HSBC's exchange rates reflected expectations of flat British and rising American exchange rates by 1.25, making it difficult to stimulate the market. As Mercantile bought March U.S. dollars again at $0.875, Yuan Mao, Yong Zhao, Feng Chang Da Xing, Yong Zhi, Feng Yong, and others joined in buying, and the price rose above $6. Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Qian Chang, Xiang Lian, and Lian Jin continuously bought, and Zhao Feng Chang also purchased. Hua Bi bought March U.S. dollars at $0.75, and the price increased to $9.</p>
<p>Supply was ample, causing a slight decline. Heng Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Shun Mao, Qian Chang, Xiang, and others maintained strong buying interest, and the price rose to $9.80. Heng Xing and Ri Chang sold again, causing another decline of $1. Later, the foreign exchange market tightened. Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, Da De Cheng, and others continued to buy, pushing the price above $50. Da Tong even bought February U.S. dollars at $0.375. Although Heng Xing and Bing Xing sold, Fu Yu, Da Lian Gang, and Rui Kang, among others, covered their positions, driving the price up to $52.80. Heng Yu and Tong Tai Chang sold, causing a decrease of $1. Yuan Sheng, Yong Fu Yu, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Chun, and others actively purchased. Mitsui bought February U.S. dollars at $3.125, and the price rose to $4.50. After some fluctuations, Da Xing Yong offered gold at the opening, and Zheng Jin continuously issued British gold for current month delivery at $1.25. The afternoon closing price retreated to $752.80. Goods were auctioned at $2.50. After the market closed, although Rui Xing sold, the price still managed to rise. The highest price for the first half of the day was $754.50, and the lowest was $743.80, a fluctuation of $10.07. Ultimately, the result was a slight decline of $1.30 compared to the closing price last Saturday.</p>
<p>The quoted price was $762, slightly weaker, due to HSBC's U.S. dollar exchange rate rising by 1.25 to $31.50. Based on the closing price, the discount was about $9, less than the previous closing. The current month's account price was $761, and the December account price was $753. The morning price for the Huangpu River was $761, and the standard price was $1,110. Within the market, You Shou Tao and Da De Cheng sold about 1,000 taels to the Guangdong group for $1,110 and $1,111. The Tianjin group bought 200 taels for $1,116, purchased at the Ying Feng price. Additionally, 99.3% fineness was priced at $1,116. Tong Feng Heng also made purchases. For the current month's bars, 1,253 bars remained.</p>

Rui Kang Yuan Chun initially sold and then bought back. Da Lian Gang and Wan Xing together traded over 3,200 bars, with over 100 bars covered. Shun Li together traded over 1,500 bars, with over 100 bars covered. Guang Gang and Heng Xing sold about 200 bars. The total number of December contracts was 30,268 bars.</p>

<p>Securities and Bond Markets Fluctuate Sharply; Too Many Speculators, Difficult to Stabilize the Market</p>
<p>The trend in the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange yesterday was quite peculiar, showing a rapid rise and fall. There were no rumors in the market, and there were no significant changes in the bond environment. Major players were only buying and not selling, yet market prices rose and fell sharply. This was undoubtedly due to excessive inventory and significant supply and demand, with no other factors at play. This was naturally within expectations. At the morning opening, buyers, especially No. 4, absorbed various items, and sellers were scarce. All bond markets rose steadily, and the atmosphere was excellent. However, speculators sought to exit, and long positions also sought to unload. Although No. 4 still had some demand, selling inevitably increased. Although there were no major sellers, the number of small sellers was also significant, indicating that long positions were exiting. Market prices then sharply declined, losing between $0.10-0.20 and $0.50, exceeding the initial gains. It was difficult to stabilize or synchronize the market's pace due to the excessive number of speculators. At the afternoon opening, market sentiment was affected, and buyers became cautious. No. 4 purchases had thinned out, and the No. 11 North Group sold off, causing prices to continue to fall by $0.20-0.30 to $0.50. The sharp fluctuations in market prices were evident. Closing transactions were light, and the market was chaotic, with gains and losses mixed. Although fluctuations were only around $0.10-0.20, there were still more declines than gains. Ultimately, market prices fell slightly by $0.20-0.30 to $0.50 for the day, indicating that the trend would likely continue to fluctuate. The total transaction volume was $10,081,700, including $2,000 in spot transactions and $3,140,000 in futures for salt tax, $1,225,000 for demobilization, $1,300,000 for customs duties, $2,095,000 for twenty customs duties, and the remainder ranging from several tens of thousands to over two hundred thousand.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Shows Slight Fatigue</p>
<p>According to a New Feng Foreign Firm report, the New York stock market on the 4th showed signs of fatigue due to the failure of rumored announcements from Washington to materialize, causing disappointment. Additionally, due to the weekend, long positions slightly profited, leading to a subdued market. Half-day transactions totaled 704,000 shares. "Wheat" trading was quiet, and prices were stable. Good news could lead to continued strength. The "Cotton" market was calm as the exchange was closed on Tuesday, and the government would announce yield estimates on Wednesday, causing investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach. "Silver" prices showed strength, but fell back slightly at the close due to long positions exiting. The Financial Reconstruction Corporation announced the gold price at $32.67 per tael, up $0.10. The Dow Jones indices are listed below.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Futures Auction Temporarily Suspended for Three Days; Reason: Ministry of Industry Refuses to Accept Yarn Delivered by New Factory Clients; Awaiting Chairman's Petition in Beijing to Determine Future Course of Action</p>
<p>The futures market experienced significant turmoil yesterday. The Ministry of Industry ordered that, from November to the end of December, the exchange refuse to accept yarn delivered by new clients and manufacturers in order to maintain the yarn market. This caused panic among both buyers and sellers, making it difficult to complete transactions. Brokers convened a meeting, but failed to reach a satisfactory solution. After repeated discussions, the Chairman decided to petition in Beijing, and the futures market was temporarily suspended. Cotton opened with fewer bids and was auctioned as usual, but some brokers opposed this, leading to a stalemate. The morning's cotton and yarn auctions did not begin. In the afternoon, the market opened at 2:00 PM, auctioning only cotton. However, most brokers remained firmly opposed, making it impossible to proceed. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Brokers Association stated that cotton auctions would also be suspended, further increasing the turmoil. Opening auctions would be more stable. As a result, price fluctuations were temporarily limited to $0.15. Only then did the market open and auction proceed. However, the matter of yarn remains unresolved.</p>
<p>--Price Fluctuation Temporarily Limited to $0.15--</p>
<p>The cotton market was calm, but overseas cotton markets were weak and exchange rates were unfavorable, leading to lower replacement costs. Therefore, market sentiment was depressed, and spot cotton business remained quiet. Recent transaction volumes were still significant, and short positions gradually covered. As a result, the market remained soft but slightly positive. Due to the turmoil in the yarn market, the morning auction was suspended. In the afternoon, the fluctuation range was temporarily limited to $0.15, and business resumed. Zheng Biao (cotton from Zhengzhou) was calm.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao auctions were affected by the yarn market and did not proceed in the morning. The market opened in the afternoon with cautious sentiment, and short positions covered, causing each month's contract to rise by $0.10-0.15. It was heard that spot cotton transactions were flat after auctioning two or three lots. As a result, near-term contracts rose by $0.05-0.10, and far-term contracts were flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 60,900 dan. Sales included 4,200 dan from Tong Fu, 4,400 dan from Da Ji, 4,200 dan from Yuan Da, 1,400 dan from Zhen Da, 1,800 dan from Chang Feng, 1,100 dan from Xie Sheng, 1,400 dan from Tong He, 2,100 dan from De Ji, and 3,400 dan from Yuan Xing Chang. Purchases included 2,000 dan from Ji Feng, 3,000 dan from Da Fu, 1,800 dan from Yu Da, 1,700 dan from Sui Long, 2,600 dan from Shen Ji, 2,800 dan from Ren Feng, 1,800 dan from Da Chang Cheng, 1,000 dan from Tai Chang, 2,500 dan from Yi Feng, and 2,200 dan from Rui Yuan.

<p>Rice Price was Settled and Soft</p>
<p>Rice came from Shanghai south area with number 27 and 28</p>
<p>Shop trade in this area was low and not much activity.</p>
<p>Luckily not much rice came, so the price was stable.</p>
<p>At noon it became softer. It was expected to be low tomorrow.</p>
<p>Those who deal in bulk still wanted to make deal from Ningpo for Green Angle Brand and in Tianjin for 300 over package. Also, about a thousand packages was expected to be received from Qingdao and Yantai.</p>
<p>Customer was difficult and not willing to make deal and so business was not doing well and so was the rice price.</p>
<p>The statistic between high rice and low rice was few point different.</p>
<p>There was no different in high kind rice from south harbor</p>
<p>There was no different in rice from Du Yang Jian. Cheap price rice was cheap but steady and the price of Yin Yuan Rice was stable.</p>
<p>(Shanghai north) Rice from area along the river today were the 30 kind.</p>
<p>Cloth was selling well and new high-price rice and low-price rice and Du and high-price rice from Bu and rice from Bai Guo are selling well.</p>
<p>The price of high priced and low-price rice was up about some point. Rice from Kilm Farm was not doing well and rice from Xiang was suddenly cheap about 0.2 dollars.</p>
<p>Today rice market from Shanghai was slow and not much trade.</p>
<p>Rice in shop was in big amount.</p>
<p>Rice from the River came to dock and it was more offer than demand.</p>
<p>Most of the sales man wanted to sell the rice quickly with little profit.</p>
<p>But there was rice from the River side and so there was no sales.</p>
<p>Trader from Hunan used the rice and those from Fuzhou made deals from 5.7 to 5.5 with rice of 2000 packages.</p>
<p>This was a loss to price 0.2 compared to sale last week.</p>
<p>This kind of rice was popular and may deal this kind of rice more.</p>
<p>From Business area we expected this kind of trade would not continue and be active.</p>
<p>The Price of Bean Starch was not going up or down much</p>
<p>Spot Good Bean Starch from north east was still delivering.</p>
<p>Starch Market was quiet. Opening business was not too active and seller from north area was asking for price. Good Bean Starch from north east was still under delivering to dock. Big firm was trying to sell and it was not too smooth and so they stopped. Beginning price then started to change and it was more steady and stable.</p>
<p>The Bean Starch was from client and more of it was from recent production.</p>
<p>It was sold at a high price for November and December. There was time where it went up 1.5. It started to drop back when firm from each area dropped the price of its goods again. It rose but came down because of the price being offered and sale in afternoon. Ending price in the closing for this month and the month next were high about 1.25. Price in January was up about 0.5 point. Price in March was same but in February and April it was high with a point of 25</p>
<p>Wheat Price wanted to go up but stopped</p>
<p>Price of Wheat Today was high at Opening. Because the Wheat from Out Area has not deliver yet and also each farm area has been asking about it. Price of the Future Wheat for this month was same high-price. The price of Wheat was expected to be high and seller were stopping the trade and they wanted to buy. The price then stopped and it was same to stop the trade from each farm area. At noon each price was little and it was due to each area having so much stock and the bean starch was still not doing well and the price of wheat in area outside was a little. So, the delivery to the area must continued. The price was soft at ending time. November was low 0.3 and from December to March was low with 0.2 point. In April it was about 0.6. From area near Yangtze, Bean Starch with 2700 package was sold to Fu Xin. Also, 400 packages were sold to Shanghai Da. It was Yangzhou Bean Starch at 3.84. Next was 3.82, and Zhen Jiang, high post brand was about 3.78 and Wu Hu Brand was about 3.58 and Tong Tai Bean Starch at 3.9 and other Bean Starch in area was about 3.87</p>
<p>Yellow Bean coming to Area was in Big Wave</p>
<p>Except for Late Bean Rice, Du Brand rice and low priced yellow rice the rest coming to area was in big wave. The Rice was about 1000 Cart. Most of the Rice in area was under quality and high price rice was in demand and it was not many. The price of low rice and high-price rice was the same but the quality was different. Today there was over 10 rice carts and 2000packages were sold in wheel. The market price then dropped about 5 or 6. In the future it was expected to see loss instead of gains. Each station added more in save guarding the rice. It must drop in about 5 days. The price would drop about big range because of adding the save guarding fee. They said if the delivery continued and it would pile too much and the location would not have more room to put. However, market price has had a big effect to it.</p>
<p>New Tung Oil has Big Sales</p>
<p>Those who press oil and production area of Tung Oil has started their trade. The production in ZheJiang, SiChuan and HuNan are less then other area.</p>
<p>New Production oil was produced but sales was known and so was price.</p>
<p>Force from area out here to here to sell the oil and so the price was 22 dollar.</p>
<p>It was in area out here and in Hang Zhou it was in Jiang Gun Area and they were being returned to Business Area out here.</p>
<p>However, it should be about 23 in old Tung Oil. Then it changed when the price was open.</p>
<p>And that was why in Hang Zhou the price was cheap and it was about 22 with the review.</p>
<p>Things would change more more and new business or older would drop when they switch.</p>
<p>And Business man wanted the oil to drop to its bottom and then open and make a profit and so the plan was to use small profit or low profit as round trade or corner trade.</p>
<p>The price of 20 hasn’t been seen in the last 10 years and in the beginning of this year it has been.</p>
<p>There’s always new sales drop the price. With all the workers here the work pay has been different than from ten years back. If the price continued to drop, it could not drop more than drop. Even those who press from area out here were held, the cost would be different. Because those from area near ZheJiang had less Tung Oil, they changed and press the oil and it (The pressing oil and Tung Oil are from the same source and they can choose what to press for profit). Because the new Tung Oil was being delivered but not too many and so people wanted the rice to keep falling the price. It would not reach it yet. However, oil from ZheJiang wasn’t the main oil and the main market was in Hang Zhou. In area out here from river side, they were the key. Yesterday those from overseas had trade of 100 ton and the price was 25.1 but afterwards only review 24.5</p>
<p>Each sales man didn’t want to drop more and so the business hasn’t started.</p>
<p>But because it was low with not much to make, area in area will not give the product to big and the business may be slow but would not continue drop because there was not much left over. Because the rice from area of SuChuan or HuNan would be late so it would not drop the price too much even it overseas stopped the trade.</p>
<p>Those from River Bank are safe in area that area has new production and it does not stay to accumulate too long, that area does not accumulate too long.</p>
<p>Sugar Market; Shanghai Rice Production drop a bit in sale.</p>
<p>Area has finished trade.</p>
<p>Today price of Sugar was little and the price was not high. The group wanted to deal from 24 with low sand rice as cheap good in 20.08 but the rice has dropped about 1 point.</p>
<p>20 middle white brand was at 20.04</p>
<p>The rice was low in sale, MKBG brand was at 16.3 and MP was at 16.2 but BDA was at 16.0</p>
<p>This factory cotton white was at 19.6</p>
<p>Rice out here was very popular.</p>
<p>It would trouble those area out here to have much rice and the rice here was only at one place with only limited supply. The new trade was expected to start and in the future it was expected that it would be hard to hold up.</p>
<p>North/South Area, Dry Red Date sold slow and cheap</p>
<p>Dry Red Date in area was being delivered more and more and it was piling up and so the price has been dropping more and more.</p>
<p>Those from Tai Zhou opened the price and it dropped from 8.1 to 8.3 and chicken heart was at 8.5 in Tianjin, those in Yi family wanted the red to be at 18.0 and in shop area from Tianjin they wanted it at 18.0 and 2 family and the 3 family wanted to be at 8.0</p>
<p>Those from yu made high big shirt and it was famous</p>
<p>It was just in time to sell shirt. Also, each store was in business to sell out here.</p>
<p>Da Chuan Tong, Tai Gu Yu, Yi He Yu and each firm out here was continuing to deal out here and because tax on mail has been remove so those who wanted to stop the purchase was restarting to trade again.</p>
<p>And with this the design on the coat was in high demand.</p>
<p>The design in the coat with new design was opened at some package and a high price was at 6.0. Other price was 4.1. Hua Lun brand was 7.0. Hua bo design in coat with flower was at 3.9 and high wool flower was at 5.0</p>
<p>Zhao Feng area was in high demand and it was at 5.5 and other price was at 4.25 and with this each piece in the wool place cost about 24.5 but good produce by Japan that are about the same price but sold at 16 here.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea were being sold a little.</p>
<p>Yesterday the market for Foreign was tea and tea from Tu Zhuang area.</p>
<p>Low produce of Gong Xi was asking from Ba Si Business group also with interest.</p>
<p>The store sold about 330 packages. Pearl tea was sold at 90. Good tea was sold between 35 to 36 and Gong Xi was sold at 24 and the prices were about the same and there has been no up and down for prices. Rice from area was almost out and so rice was almost too low and the market would be on its way to be out of date.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<p>Anti-Zou Yuanliang</p>
<p>Regarding the discussion of "Zhuangzi and Wen Xuan," some publications no longer directly raise the question of whether everyone should study them, but rather shift the focus to other matters. They are mocking those who oppose "Wen Xuan" but have themselves written classical prose and read classical books.</p>
<p>This is truly formidable. It is roughly what is called "using your spear to attack your shield!" Sorry, here comes "classical books" again!</p>
<p>One cannot know the truth about prison unless one has been imprisoned. Following a wealthy person, or being wealthy oneself, making a phone call first, and then visiting, one only sees the prison guards being very friendly and the prisoners being able to speak freely in English. If one wants to know the details, then one must be a former prison guard or a released prisoner. Naturally, they still have bad habits, but their advice to not enter prison is more credible than what famous people say about how complete the education and hygiene of a model prison are, or that it is much better than a poor person's home.</p>
<p>However, it is said that if one has been tainted by prison, one cannot say that prison is bad. Prison guards or prisoners are all bad people, and bad people cannot say good things. Only good people can say that prison is good, and that is a good thing. Reading "Wen Xuan" and saying it is useless is not as good as not reading "Wen Xuan" and saying it is useful. The gentlemen who oppose "anti-Wen Xuan" have naturally read it</p>
<h3>Damage to Floating Bridge</h3>
<p>At that time, the pontoon bridge at Pier No. 9 was heavily struck by the bow of the "Xinfeng" vessel, causing the two floating bridges on the left side of the waterway, which were secured to the pier with large iron chains, to be snapped off simultaneously by the impact and fall onto the bank of the Huangpu River.  The pontoon at Pier No. 9 was also severely struck, with all connecting iron chains broken and the pontoon itself rammed into the embankment, causing significant damage. According to a report from the South Wharf pier supervisor, the No. 9 pontoon was pushed in by the "Xinfeng" by as much as fifteen feet, and the two floating bridges on the left side were completely broken and fell into the water. The extent of the damage is yet to be estimated.</p>
<h3>Passengers Thoroughly Frightened</h3>
<p>At the time of the incident, there were many passengers on board the ship traveling south from Tianjin, all preparing to disembark. Suddenly, the ship rammed into the pier.  Workers and greeters standing on the No. 9 pontoon and floating bridges were caught in the impact.  Many were nearly thrown into the Huangpu River by the uplift of the floating bridges.  They all fled towards Pier No. 10, creating a chaotic and noisy scene. Passengers on the ship were greatly frightened.  The ship was then put into reverse, and a left-side anchor was dropped, finally managing to move the ship alongside Pier No. 10. By the time the "Xinfeng" came to a complete stop, it was already late at night.</p>
<h3>Shipowner Reports to the Bureau</h3>
<p>Shipowner Qian Yujia went to the bureau yesterday morning to report the pier collision to the shipping department.  According to the shipowner, the "Xinfeng" passed the Lismore &amp; Company channel at 5:03 AM, arrived in front of the Mobil Oil pier at 5:08 AM at half speed, passed Lujiazui and slowed down before reaching the customs house. After passing Xinkai River, it was already behind the Jianghua steamer's stern, so it quickly reversed and sounded three short blasts. Upon reaching the Jinliyuan Pier No. 5, it was put into reverse again. Unexpectedly, the rudder failed to turn, unresponsive to the helmsman's commands, and the ship crashed into the pier. Fortunately, an anchor was dropped on the left side, otherwise the damage would have been even worse. Afterwards, the shipowner and chief mate inspected why the steering gear malfunctioned and discovered that too many smuggled parcels were being carried on board, pressing down on the steering mechanism, which led to the accident.  The above is what Shipowner Qian told reporters. It is said that his report to the general bureau will also be based on this explanation.</p>
<h3>Surveying the Damage</h3>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched personnel from the engineering division to the South Wharf to survey the damage in order to arrange repairs as soon as possible.  Fortunately, the bow of the "Xinfeng" was not seriously damaged, only the areas where it scraped against a lighter at Baihe and bumped against the pier at Yantai need to be repaired before it can sail again. This incident with the "Xinfeng" is similar to the case last summer when shipowner Zhu Wenbing's "Jiangjing" steamer collided with the Jardine Matheson's "Dean". It is said that the responsibility will fall on the shipowner.</p>
<h3>Alas, a Woman Commits Suicide in a Hotel - Tears Unfaded, Blood Flowing From Her Mouth - Claiming to be Song Mei, Why Did She Take Her Life?</h3>
<p>At the Yuezhou Hotel on Yuezhou Road, at around 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, a female guest suddenly arrived, approximately thirty years old, claiming to be named Song Mei. She rented Room No. 8 from the hotel clerk, Zhi Xixiang, paying one dollar. Zhi immediately noticed that she looked sad, with tears still wet on her face, but he did not know the reason. After the female guest went to the room, she closed the door. About twenty minutes later, the tea servant, as usual, prepared tea for the guest and pushed the door open, only to find her lying on the bed, with blood flowing from her mouth. He asked her, but she did not respond. The tea servant was shocked and immediately ran to tell the clerk, who reported it to the Huishan Police Station. Inspector Chen Baozhong was ordered to investigate and then sent her to the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital for treatment, but it was to no avail, and she soon died. The hospital doctor observed that a rope was tied around the woman's neck. The body was taken to the forensics office on Pei Lun Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Wei from the First Special District Court was assigned to examine the body at the office. According to Zhi Xixiang's statement of the previous situation, Judge Guo concluded that the deceased female, Song Mei, committed suicide by poisoning. The body was handed over to the Pushan Public Benevolent Hall for burial. The rope was handed over to the court's property storage.</p>

<h3>Pawnshops Request Equal Treatment</h3>
<p>The pawnshops in the Shanghai city area recently sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession, requesting that the Municipal Council grant small pawnshops the same treatment as large pawnshops regarding the decision to levy license fees on the pawnbroking industry. The letter stated: "Dear Sirs, It has been customary in the pawnbroking industry in this city to divide businesses into pawnshops and pledge shops, depending on the amount of capital, and then converted each into trade associations due to the new regulations. Although the business methods of the members of the two associations may have slight differences, the calculation method for levying license fees within the concession has always been the same without any discrimination. Recently, reading the "Shen Xin Bao" on October 6th, we learned from the Municipal Council's news that the Financial Department and the Pawnbroking Association are in contact to reduce the current license fees to 0.2% of the annual turnover for large pawnshops and 0.4% per annum for small pawnshops. This proposal was approved by the Board of Directors on October 3rd and will be implemented from January 1, 1934. Our colleagues in the pledge business are very alarmed by this news, because the capital of the pledge shop is not as strong as that of a large pawnshop. The position it occupies in the business cannot be compared with that of a large pawnshop. The only reason it can compete with a large pawnshop is that the taxes are the same, and the business of the pledge shop is extremely accommodating. If the revised tax rate differs by as much as one time, then the pledge industry will inevitably be eliminated in the future because it cannot receive the same equal treatment as large pawnshops. (omitted paragraph) We have always admired your association as the mouthpiece of the citizens in the concession. For any administrative actions within the concession that are clearly unfair or may harm the public interest, you will uphold justice and speak out to correct them. (omitted paragraph) Please grant the decision to reduce the license fees for large pawnshops the same equal treatment as the tax rate levied on small pawnshops, so as to avoid major misunderstandings between the two industries due to discrimination. We earnestly hope for your support."</p>

<h3>Tonghua Steamer Damages Haizhou Steamer - Demands Compensation for Losses from China Merchants Bureau -</h3>
<p>The siltation of the Haizhou Dapu Port is becoming increasingly serious, making navigation more difficult. Collisions and groundings are common news. The China Merchants Bureau's Tonghua steamer was heading to Haizhou this time. On the 30th of last month, when the ship arrived at Dapu Port and turned around in front of the Longhai Railway Bureau's pier, it collided with the Hezhong Company's Haizhou steamer. At that time, the iron plate on the port side of the bow of the Haizhou steamer was damaged by about one foot and several inches by the Tonghua. The Haizhou steamer returned to Shanghai from Dapu Port yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai, it reported to the Hezhong Company and demanded compensation from the China Merchants Bureau for the losses. Therefore, a letter was sent to the China Merchants Bureau, requesting a public notary to inspect the damaged area of the Haizhou steamer at the pier in order to hire workers to repair it.</p>
