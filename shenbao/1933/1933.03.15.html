<h3>時評</h3>
<p>軍備竸爭開始晦</p>
<p>（一）軍縮形成僵局之原因</p>
<p>熱河境内砲火掀天之際日内瓦湖邊依然唱和平高調繼續所謂軍備縮小會議似乎世界主要各國皆有和平誠意皆願縮小軍備者然然而實際是否如此殊值得吾人玩味也</p>
<p>自德意志國家社會黨秉政以來力謀打破現狀積極圖謀其國家之發展一面欲脫離凡爾塞和約一切束縛一面要求德國與其他各國之軍備平等蓋由歐戰以至今日下九年間眞正負挑戰責任者究非今日德國大多數之國民但德國人迄被處罰而擔負其所不應負不願負之戰爭責任故皆鳴其不平而寄同情於開倒車持扁狹國家主義之希特勒以爲德國今後將因希特勒之領導而逹到羣衆之希望於是乎東脅波蘭南聯意大利大有一舉而破棄凡爾塞和約之勢</p>
<p>然則法國何以表示沉默對希特勒之飛躍猛進視若無覩耶其將於必要時準備應戰耶抑相當讓步以求暫時的和緩也法國之於歐洲大陸所必不肯放鬆者厥有三端第一爲如何維持其覇權第二爲如何確立其安全保障第三爲如何脅制蘇聯使不得向西歐發展</p>
<p>資本主義制度發逹至於今日自由主義勢必淘汰獨占乃爲今日之特徵是故活躍於世界者非産業資本而爲金融資本近年以來執世界金融資本牛耳者爲美國在歐洲居金融資本指導地位者厥爲法蘭西歐洲各國莫不現金枯竭失業成羣惟法國則保有現金值八百二十億法郎以上用些以君臨歐洲用此以壓服德意志意大利祇須資本主義制度存在則德國亦莫如之何况美國金融恐慌發生之後雖云勉强保持金本制度但事實上已禁止現金出口此於法國金融雖不無影響而於歐洲則反增加法國地位之穏固希特勒號爲中層分子之代表者以復興德意志帝國自命而暗中仍與英法金融資本求妥恊圖諒解是則德國之屈膝於金法郎之下者必矣旣有金融資本爲主力其歐洲覇權自當歸諸法國</p>
<p>軍備竸爭意大利固無時或忘然始終不能出地中海以外近半年雖有數艘快速船隻環繞世界一旦有事即可改裝軍艦然其數有限其力至微而近代戰爭之最後决賽所依恃不全在於武器而在於整個的國民經濟條件以意大利資源窮乏産業落後僅恃黑衣宰相之天才又烏足以敵法德意志雖爲先進國家自大戰以來所謂復興者全憑外資現在巿場日窄存貨山積擁有六百萬失業工人之國家豈能以感情衝動對外作戰耶是以德國縱高倡軍備平等實際彼仍舊缺乏擴張軍備之財力是以法國之安全仍無多大危險不過嚴密防備則爲勢所必然者也</p>
<p>希特勒登台以來即竭其全力以鎭壓共産黨以减削共黨勢力雖未能直接侵害蘇聯但於西歐共産黨之發展乃給予莫大打擊即間接予蘇聯以牽制亦即穏定資本主義之一法蓋五年計劃以四年期間宣告完成以來雖其中尚不免有若干缺點可以指摘而其昭示於歐洲各國勞工之影響乃大過於百萬雄兵反映於資本主義尤爲嚴重當此時期英法各國對德國政情之蛻化豈僅尋常之焦慮而已是故惟有假手於希特勒假手於巴本鎭壓共産黨勢力之勃發亦即所以阻止蘇聯勢力之西進此亦爲穏定西歐現勢保持法國覇權之道也</p>
<p>（二）軍縮停頓軍擴開始</p>
<p>德國旣忙於鎭壓内變又急於軍備平等法國受此剌激擴張軍備自在意中意大利更當　預奮進希國征取其地中海覇權英吉利在此情勢下亦豈能甘心落伍歐洲局勢之纷亂對立之嚴重此後恐更加急劇也</p>
<p>日本鑒此情勢英國急於應付歐洲更須腐心保持其殖民地之際彼乃乘時而起擴張其陸海軍力陸軍方由朝鮮延長北至中東路沿缐而西迄長城併我東北四省以入於日本之勢力範圍憑恃撫順之煤鞍山之鐵黑龍江之金熱河之羊毛即可資其軍用南向可以更進一步而侵略華北北向將以抵制蘇聯之赤化太平洋上之制覇因天然資源之有恃而更於胆於擴充運實也且其南進政策最爲注意者恐不在大陸地之閩粤而在非利濱蓋日本欲制覇太平洋獨占中國巿塲有菲島在殊足以威脅之至少亦足以牽制其軍事行動是以襲取菲利濱乃爲日本國策之一無可諱也</p>
<p>於是乎北美合衆國將增加不安激起憤怒對遠東問題惡化之防備將愈見緊密新艦之建造勢必加工雖金融恐慌正在急激之際似難有餘力以從事於軍事然而軍事工業之陡興亦足以剌戟一般巿面之景氣美國旣内受金潮之激盪外受日本之威脅故其結局仍不免於擴充軍備亦意中事</p>
<p>總之軍備縮小今後將成爲一種歷史名詞和平洵爲人類互助所不可少之理想然而在此軍備竸爭勢將復原之時期和平殆已成爲外交席上之談助眞正之國際關係當在爆藥鋼鐵之中見之</p>

<h3>蘇聯最近對外政策</h3>
<p>（莫洛道夫原著）</p>
<p>訂不侵犯條約爲外交巨大勝利</p>
<p>對遠東問題始終表示嚴守中立</p>
<p>在五年計劃諸年間各國勞動大衆對蘇聯的同情大爲增加這是不容置疑的這不能不說是蘇聯國際地位之重大鞏固同時蘇聯對各國相互關係之事實亦證明了這一點如過去的一年間訂立許多互不侵犯條約就是明證</p>
<p>蘇聯對各國的關係約言之事屬經常雖然有些國家的政府再三更迭蘇聯對外關係旣是由他本國力量之發展來决定那末他這種關係就隨着五年計劃之勝利自然而然的要鞏固了</p>
<p>在蘇聯的對外關係中德國要算居於特殊地位在與蘇聯有外交關係的各國中惟德對蘇經濟關係最密這個並非出於偶然乃是兩國利益所致</p>
<p>此外士國務總理伊斯美巴西和外長魯德比兩氏之親訪蘇聯亦係促進兩國携手使之更爲鞏固此由於國際環境和一般和平之利益與士蘇兩國携手有更形擴大之必要所致土國兩領袖在莫簽訂許多實際的文化與財政恊定這是大家皆知之事</p>
<p>去年蘇聯對外關係之發展尚有若干新事實足資叙述如中蘇外交關係之恢復是中蘇關係之破裂當日係由中國政府所主動今日兩國關係之恢復亦是出於中國政府自動建議而蘇聯政府曾予以充分同意我人以爲對蘇關係所犯之錯誤已由此糾正且蘇聯政府亦未阻止其糾正</p>
<p>二三國家據說現在尚在討論確定對蘇外交關係之問題聽說有些人尚認爲須特别研究蘇聯譬如捷克斯拉夫的部長們深刻地研究蘇聯已不至一年了但由此所得的利益可說毫無這種老調唱了十多年了蘇維埃政權之存在已有十五年而蘇聯之成立至今亦已十年多了這個姑且不論跟着捷國走的尚有美國這種國家的部長們常常問着蘇聯究竟是什麽尤其在完成第一次五年計劃之後這問題的應該明白實在不容再緩蘇聨力量已有多麽强盛其發展已有多麽偉大其國際意義已如何增長均不難預測的此外在對蘇聯無外交關係而首遭損失的就是空談特别研究蘇聯的那些國家哩</p>

<h3>孔祥熙暢論歐洲現狀與德意政局趨勢</h3>
<p>世界政治组織多趨向獨裁制度</p>
<p>德國最近有趨於一黨專政可能</p>
<p>考察歐洲實業專使孔祥熙氏返京已有兩日昨發表歐洲大局之現狀及德意兩國政局之趨勢之談話如次</p>
<p>歐洲各國因受世界經濟恐慌之影響大部份均呈蕭條不安之象此種情形尤以工業最發逹之國家爲甚試觀各國對外貿易數字之减少及失業人數之增多即其明證又如各國政府當局爲欲挽救其危難起見於經濟政策多趨重於保護主義與産業合理化於政治组織多趨向獨裁制度此種思想幾已瀰漫全歐甚至及於全世界英國本爲自由貿易之代表現已改保護稅則且有實行計劃經濟之主張英國又爲政黨政治之鼻祖而麥克唐納爾首相不惜放棄工黨領袖之立塲與各黨代表合组混合内閣以應付當前之困難此種事實之表現足以代表歐洲目前政治經濟之趨勢但各國施行保護關稅之結果遂造成一種經濟的國家主義現象影響所及使各國對外貿易日趨於衰落生産量隨之减少失業人數因而增多人民生活旣感困難社會秩序遂呈不安如果長此下去任何富裕之國家亦將同趨破産而不可收拾各國於此已有覺悟即將用國際會議方式解决此種共同之危機無如各國之間尚缺乏充分互助之諒解於考慮共同問題之時每易側重自身之利害而且此事又直接間與戰債賠欵軍縮東亞和平等重大國際問題有關任一問題之牽連皆足影響此事之談判故將來能否美满解决此時殊難預料也</p>
<p>關於德國政局之趨勢照最近情形觀察頗有趨於一黨專政之可能德國人民因受戰敗之剌激頗有發奮自强之雄心但以凡爾塞條約束縛太嚴兼受世界經濟恐慌之影響致使如許優秀有爲之民族終不能跳出火坑其痛苦鬰忿之情不言可知兼之德國西接英法東連俄意地理上又成各種主義之中心一般青年旣深感於環境之壓迫復受剌於主義之宣傅兼之生活痛苦情緒遂日趨於激越結果德國政治之鬥爭遂日趨於尖銳化共産黨代表左派國社黨代表右派社會民主黨以維護威瑪憲法而居中其餘如天主敎中央黨國權黨巴爾凡人黨德意志人民黨等各以其特殊之立塲時分時合操縱其間三年以來擾攘纷爭各不相下德國政府因之不能穏定去年兩次選舉國社黨竟一躍而佔國會第一黨之地位希特拉之聲望盛極一時希撤勒内閣倒後興登堡總統勢不能不委希氏繼任而置其素所倚重之巴本於副席此實爲德國政治一最大轉變蓋希氏上臺以後挾其衆多黨員以爲後盾勢必於德國政策有所改更希氏上臺顯然於共黨不利難免共黨不與之搗亂故爲先發制人計即一面發布檢查新聞郵電命令以防止反對黨活動一面下令解散國會於三月五日改選余（孔氏自稱）在歸國途中聞希氏已獲全勝希氏控制國會之希望至此已如願以償以余觀察實因德國人民年來飽受政局不定之痛苦希氏旣已上臺率性進一步予以贊助俾其不受國會牽掣以發揮其政治才能解除人民痛苦其次因共産黨放火焚燒帶有國家光榮歷史價值之國會會塲一事實足激動德人反感使一般稍爲清明穏重之士對共産黨發生一種厭惡憤恨心理此種人民心理之轉變相信實爲促成國社黨勝利之主因雖然希氏固已大獲勝利矣但其未來之難題尚多第一希氏所標榜之政策太高太大如取消凡爾賽條約解决失業問題實行社會保險獨佔事業國有化等等口號固然是德國目前一般之要求但如欲實現决非易事其次共産黨與社會民主黨兩大勁敵雖被壓倒但其潛在之勢力仍非一時所能消滅假如希氏政策不能兌現反對黨便可乘機再起第三希氏黨徒大都中産階级分子其將來政策如何能使各階级利益調和無間亦係問題據近日報載希氏黨徒乘戰之餘威處處對反對派以重大威脅全世界人士心理爲之表示緊張尤以法英諸國爲甚如果操之過切是否引起國際責難亦極可慮不過德國久處凡爾賽條約壓迫之下一旦得一月膽識之人才又與意大利寄其同感雖内外應付之非易相信必能打破難關爲日耳曼民族放一異彩威瑪憲法原則與希氏主張頗多不符其中若干條文或將修改如國内外情形嚴重希氏或倣效墨索里尼宣布獨裁亦未可知觀最近希氏命令改易國旗一事似可信希氏對於德國未來前途抱有極大之决心也</p>

<h3>工廠檢查恊會爲特區檢查權宣言</h3>
<p>昨招待新聞界今明集工商界</p>
<p>報告經過并謀恊議具體辦法</p>
<p>中國工廠檢查恊會以本巿特區當局侵害工廠檢查權特於昨日　午二時假靜安寺路華安八樓招待新聞界到各報社記者二十餘人并定今日　午二時召集各工廠同業公會明日下午二時召集各工會恊商辦法地址暫假巿商會茲分誌情形如下</p>
<p>報告經過由田和卿報告云自政府頒布工廠法及工廠檢　法後實業部當即舉辦工廠檢查人員養成所以該所訓練畢業之人員担任工廠檢查事宜本巿主管官署社會局特設股進行實施初步工廠檢查正進行間因滬戰發生而停頓及至去年九月一日始正式開始初步檢查中國工廠檢查恊會爲工廠檢查人員所组織現初步實施檢查已告完竣惟特區檢查雖經巿政府再三與特區當局恊商詎料特區當局陽示贊同陰實設法阻撓謀奪我檢查權本會以事關國家主權顧全工商業本身利害起見誓與力爭並將與工商業界恊議具體辦法今特招待報界希予以言論上之援助以挽國權本會另有宣言發表因時間關係不詳報告</p>
<p>地皮章程該會宣言云本巿特區當局於工廠檢查事權妄思　奪其爲違法越權實至明顯此事於各方利害及國家主權關係至鉅本會心所謂危難安　默謹就見聞所及爲國人告之查洋涇浜地皮章程訂立之初我國當道曾參與其事然一八六九年及一八九八年彼方曾將地皮章程單獨修改未經我國政府之參加承認故該章程之法律效力實有疑義茲姑以此未經我國參加承認而爲彼方視爲公共租界之组織法之地皮章程而言則工部局之權限已明載該章程第几欵内自不能越出第几欵列舉事項之外關於工廠或勞工狀况之管理事項無論就該章程之詞句上或含義上觀之特區當局皆無過問之餘地何得妄思染指此其一</p>
<p>法家公認民國十二年六月公共</p>
<p>租界曾有童工調查委員會之组織當時工部局法律顧問拉德氏（譯音）謂工部局欲制定童工條例使納　人遵守於法殊無根據因此該委員會所建議之童工條例擱置未行民國十九年費唐法官來滬調查公共租界之一般狀况其報告書第二卷載有一在　去三十年中租界及其毘連區域内之工業發展甚速人口增加一倍在此變遷極速之狀况下工部局無立法權以增加　權力以致行政工作感受困難對於各種新事業不能施展權力如管理勞工狀况一層即其一例有許多重要事務巿政府得在管轄區内行使職權而工部局在租界内無權處理工部局對於此等事務尤其關於學校及勞工狀况之管理問題之無力活動自足引起批評者之責難及中國官署在租界内行使職權之企圖等語（見英文本報告書卷二第二一三頁）夫以處於租界當局立塲上之法律專家如拉德費唐二人亦有認租界當局對於勞工狀况無權管理良以事成鐵案雖欲廻護亦有所不能也此其二</p>
<p>英使復函一八六三年六月十二日滬上有若干外僑致函駐京英使勃羅司長（ＳirFederckBruce）請將中國地方官在租界内之權力加以限制同年八月六日勃氏復函有非受雇於外僑之華人應完全受中國官憲之統治與居住華界同等語此就租界之歷史沿革而言亦可見特區當局企圖纂奪工廠檢查權之亦當此其三</p>
<p>野心攘奪特區當局屢次聲言不承認中國政府在特區内之權力此言實屬荒謬之至試商中國政府曾於可年何日根據何項條約將租界内之主權全部放棄國家對於住居本國領域内之人民有至高無上惟一不可分之主權此爲構成獨立國家之最高原則今特區之領土權仍屬我國住居特區内之人民與住居特區外之人民同有服從國家意旨遵守國家法令之義務斷不容特區當局伸其巨靈之掌推出特區内人民於國家權力圈外此等法理特區當局亦何嘗不知祇以野心難戢於苦思力索之餘遂有設法修改地皮章程附則第三十四條之舉該附則規定在公共租界創立某種企業須於事前向工部局領取執照并須受其約束此次修改之法即擬於該附則所列舉之各種企業下加入工廠　項揣該當局之意以爲此項修改附則之舉經本年四月十九日纳稅外人會議通過後即可遂其攘奪之私然聚若干外僑於一掌呼嘯終日議而成案著爲律令遽欲執此以宰制我納稅華人此種單方面之行動我納稅華人豈能承認徒見其心勞日拙而已</p>
<p>防患未然再就各方利害觀念如本巿工廠檢查事務劃歸數個機關辦理則事權不一政令纷歧各廠除應遵行本國勞工法　外又須受工部局之非法拘束則將來之糾纷正未有窮且特區當局此次爭取工廠檢查其目光實注射於管理工廠及勞工之一般事權比非本會鰓鰓過慮吾人試以工部局依洋涇浜地皮章程之規定而應有之職權與工部局現有之權力相較即可推知蓋歷年以來該當局處心積慮將自身權力肆意擴張歷時旣久則以旣成事實視之國人亦噤莫敢爭一任此畸形组織之發育滋長日趨龐大此次工廠檢查之事如任其辦理則彼俟此項政權之基礎確立後自必師其故智得寸進尺愈演愈寛循此以往必將租界内一切勞工行政及管理工廠之權悉數奪歸已有近年來國人對於已失之主權方力謀收回豈容冉蹈前轍將未失之主權輕輕斷送特區工廠檢查問題各界人士以國家多故或未措意及此然今日稍一不愼種此惡因則將來之惡果寗堪設想我政府當局職責所在深望能據理力爭如稍瞻顧各界人士亦應一致奮起努力抗爭以促特區當局之反省本會以改進工廠檢查事業爲職志聞見較切用敢布其區區邦人君子幸共鑒之</p>
<p>函各團體中國工廠檢查恊會昨日分函上海國貨工廠聯合會等各團體云本巿工廠檢查實施已久而特區當局蔑視我國主權多方阻撓近且變本加厲擬於本年四月十九日納稅外僑特别會議開會時設法修改洋涇浜地皮章程附則第三十四條俾可强迫廠向工部局領取執照并强施種種非法拘束茲特定於本月十五日下午二時謹備茶點假座巿商會邀集本巿工業界同人一叙俾可羣策羣力恊議應付之方事關國家主權及工業界本身利害務希貴會推舉代表一人準時蒞臨爲盼</p>

<h3>口外砲火連天上海日貨進口</h3>
<p>兩星期内二十餘萬件</p>
<p>熱戰發生後日貨輸入轉較上月爲多蓋各地日商恐戰事擴大或將妨碍海運故纷纷將日本存貨提前起運來華自三月二日起直至今日兩星期内日貨之運到上海者早經日商配定共計二十五萬件分九次運來先後裝來者已有八次其未到者僅祇一船耳已經運來者以布疋海味電料玻璃以及橡皮製品等居多漂粉亦屬不少更有大批東糖平均統計約值六七百萬元</p>
<p>三批進口日郵社六甲丸阿蘇丸三笠丸等三艘由日本橫濱大阪神户等開來於前昨等日抵滬分卸在匯山日郵兩處碼頭棧房中茲經查明阿蘇丸裝到一萬五千三百六十件六甲丸裝到一萬九千一百十二件三笠丸裝到二萬五百六十六件來貨中各物全備以棉織革製五金玻璃海産砂糖等爲多更有轉運長江貨近八千件亦同時裝到但續聞二十日二十一日二十六日尚有筑波丸生駒丸等三船裝貨六萬件來滬　改易牌號昨自深知日貨運輸</p>
<p>之某君語記者曰近日各地抵貨表面上似極嚴厲但日貨輸入轉較以前增加數倍而不聞有所檢出蓋日貨之來滬其提卸方法與改裝包箱之巧妙使國人（除經營日貨之奸商外）竟無從識别上海現有數家專做改牌换箱改包手續貨主給予若干佣金便可化爲非日本貨矣近來到滬日貨十九均由改牌售出者故滬地日商對我國海關宣布之進口貨須註明原國名條例堅决反對者即此故也</p>

<h3>文學上的折扣</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>有一種聊小報以登載誣　一部分人的小說自鳴得意理姓名也都給以影射的　然對於投稿說是如含攻　個人或團體件質者恕不揚載了便不禁想到了一些事</p>
<p>凡我所遇見的研究國文學的外國人中往往不满於中國文章之誇大這眞是雖然研究中國文學恐怕到死還不會懂得中國文學的外國人情是我們中國人則只要看遇幾百篇文章見過十來個所謂文學家的行徑又不是剛剛從民　來的老實青年就决不會當因爲我們慣熱了恰如錢店伙計的看見鈔票一設知道什麽是通行的什麽是該打折扣的什麽是廢票簡直要不得</p>
<p>譬如說罷稱贊貴相是兩耳垂肩這時我們便至少將打一個對折覺得比通常出許大一點可是决不相信他的耳朶像猪嘛一樣說愁是是白髮三千丈這時我們便至少將他打一個二萬扣以爲也許有七八尺但决不相信牠會盤在頂上像一個大草囤這種尺寸雖然有些模胡不過總不至於相差太遠反之我們也能將少的增多無的化有例如戲台上走出四個拿刀的瘦伶仃的小戲子我們就知道這是十萬精兵刋物上登載一篇儼乎其然的像煞有介事的文章我們就知道字裏行間遠有看不見的鬼把戲</p>
<p>又反之我們並且能將有的化無例如什麽枕戈待旦呀臥薪嘗膽呀盡忠報國呀我們也就卽刻會看成白纸恰如還未定影的照片遇到了日光一般</p>
<p>但這些文章我們有時也還看蘇束坡貶黃州時無聯之至有客來便他談鬼客說没有東坡道你姑且胡說一通罷我們的看也不過這意思但又可知道社會上有這樣的東西是費去了多少無聊的眼力人們往往以爲打牌跳舞有害實則這種文章的害還要大因爲一不小心就會給牠敎成後天的低能見的</p>
<p>頌詩早已拍馬春秋已經隐瞒戰國時談士　起不是以危　聽就是以美詞動聽於是誇大將　撒謊層出不窮現在的文人雖然改著了洋服而骨髓裏却還埋着老祖宗所以必須取或折扣這　顯出幾分的眞實</p>
<p>文學家倘不用事實來證明他已經改變了他的誇大裝腔撒謊的老脾氣則卽使對天立誓說是從此要十分正經否則天誅地滅也還是徒勞的因爲我們也早已看慣了許多家都釘着假冒王麻子滅眼三代的金漆牌子的了又何况他連小尾巴也還在搖搖搖呢</p>
<h3>航空救國</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>近幾天上海航空救國的空氣非常濃厚報纸上公司大玻璃窗上電車上都先後的貼出航空救國人人參加八個白底紅字的廣告不錯目前的中國的確應該救過去與日本兵交過幾次戰從戰爭經騐上人明白了日本飛機是最厲害不過的所以要救國要抵抗日本帝國主義侵略的戰爭定要有大量的飛機在戰爭時助戰才行</p>
<p>據說國家是人民的所以要救國就該人民自已起來想辦法大人先生們說航空可以救國人民自該設法捐募飛機</p>
<p>不過在這裏却不能不令人懷疑到國家似乎没有飛機這麽一回事情上如果有爲什麽不見飛機隊抗日戰的消息而要人民們來想辦法呢事實上中國是有飛機的不過它們不是用以抗日罷了</p>
<p>從這一事實中我們可以看出來中國的飛機是專留給政府剿匪的因爲這是政府應做的事至於抗日需要若干飛機雖然爲了救國其實也是救老百姓自已所以人民應該人人參加快快的多多的購置一些飛機好用以抗日救國救自已</p>
<h3>春天裏的冬天</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>這不是春天這是春天裏的冬天春光還没有來到人間</p>
<p>人間充满了的是料峭的春寒氣壓低降緊魔着每個人的心</p>
<p>報纸的揭示牌前圍着不少人在觀看大風吹着報纸的一角噗噗地　動報上標着特號鉛字熱河失守湯玉麟不戰而走</p>
<p>媽的這傢伙我早知道他有這一天一個看報人歎息痛恨地說</p>
<p>無缐電播音台上在散播着戰事失利的消息聽的人不住搖頭</p>
<p>金業交易所裏空氣非常緊張風潮洶湧</p>
<p>巿場中充满了謠言充满了不安定的靈魂和不安的心</p>
<p>每個人都對着一塊牌子發呆牌子上標着上星期六金巿收盤的數目七百五十九兩六錢</p>
<p>九點半毛盤閉出一湯直下衝進七百兩大關六百九十八兩</p>
<p>九點四十分再跌三兩六百九十五</p>
<p>九點四十一分巿塲又起了謠言美國將要廢止金本位暴跌三十五兩六百六十</p>
<p>哎哟人叢中暈倒人一個空頭路上人們像喪家之犬一般走着汽車嗚嗚嗚喇叭聲中充满了凄凉的情味</p>
<p>愁雲慘霧密佈在每個人的心上每個人的心裏都好像失了一件東西</p>
<p>這便是一九三三年的春天春天裏的冬天</p>
<h3>巴黎談屑</h3>
<p>— 蕭石君寄自巴黎</p>
<p>（三）奇人的奇死</p>
<p>好的翻譯眞是一種創作現在單京詩說祖國近年來有不少的人翻譯西洋的時歌他們的那種不辭艱險的努力自足使人生敬但就我個人的趣味說使我百讀不厭的還是蘇曼殊譯的拜倫留别雅典女郎的那幾首短短的抒情詩如果說詩不是美的讀頌美的叙述也不是美的一面鏡子而是美的自身正像一朶鮮花在纸面上有牠的色香有牠的與生俱來的情麗的形態那末蘇曼殊的那幾首譯時眞可當之無愧因蘇曼殊的奇特的生涯我聯想到法國文學史上的奇人勒瓦爾（ＧerarddeNerval）勒瓦爾譯過歌德的浮士德這部譯品至今爲法國文壇上的　寳歌德本人也說遇在各種浮士德的譯本中勒瓦爾的譯木可稱壓卷之作不消說勒瓦爾還有許多不朽的創作要叙述起來不是短篇文字所能了事現在祇說說他的奇特的生涯罷了</p>
<p>勒瓦爾一八○八年五月二十二日生於巴黎他的父親是軍醫母親是在他極小的時候就死去了他養育在他伯父家裏他是一個早熟的人十八歲的時候便出了六卷短篇詩集有一天做節挨近黃昏的時候他看見一位闊人家的小姐從别　出來同幾　鄉下姑娘在草地上跳舞勒瓦爾也加到她們的隊伍裏去這位闊小姐也同他跳舞了一回他所稱爲阿德梨耶奴（Ａdrienne）的使的這人她並唱了一首歌給他聽這歌裏面叙述往日一位公主愛上了一個人她的父親生氣把她幽囚在塔裏詞調非常凄婉勒瓦爾眼裏看見這麽美麗的姑娘耳裏聽到這麽纏綿的調子魂登時不知飛到那裏去了後來勒瓦爾聽到阿德梨耶奴出家不久又聽到她死了於是這副倩影一直到勒瓦爾吊死的那個時辰爲止没有離開過他的腦海他和一位年輕的女　呌做可倫（ＪennyColon的戀愛的時候不外把可倫當做阿德梨耶奴的替身所以可倫有時和他吵嘴便爽爽快快的說你那裏有心愛我勒瓦爾在巴黎從事著述的時候浪漫主義的空氣風靡了法國的文壇一般人的行動都朝怪僻的方面走可是勒瓦爾在表面上並不像和他同輩的人們那般怪僻他的朋友大抵說他是極可愛的人一天他在街上走手裏拿着一匹龍暇向人說這匹暇不會出聲但牠知道海中的事隨後說了許多疯話人便把他他送到醫院表去這是一八四一年三月二十九日的事一直往到是年十一月二十一日醫生才呌他退院這次發狂的主因是基於和他的愛人可倫吵嘴一八四二年六月五日可倫死了勒瓦爾自然受到重大的剌激是年十二月他便决計從巴黎出發向東方去旅行他之所以决計往東方去一半是想藉遠游忘掉可倫死去的悲痛一半也想呌世人知道他的瘋病完全治好了他逗留西里亞（Syria）</p>
<p>的時候又戀了一位非洲年輕女子不多時日就和她結了婚不消說他又是把她當做阿德梨耶奴去温他少時的綺夢這位非洲女子性格異常熱烈同居不久便離開了他後和一位土耳其人結緍生了許多兒女勒瓦爾在一八四三年的年尾單身回到巴黎於是不分畫夜的出没於那些偏僻的小街道和那些小酒館在這幾年間他寫了許多優美的文字把德國詩人海湼的作品譯成極漂亮的散文卽是在這時期着手的一八五三年的春天他去拜訪海湼向海湼說了種種瘋話海湼馬上呌一部馬車將他送進醫院以後時好時病一八五四年遊德歸來他的瞒病再發醫生診斷他没有全愈的希望了他的朋友都替他擔憂而他的行動一天一天更加離奇錢一到手他便拿去買一些用不着的裝飾品最奇特的是他費許多錢買一張大床他告訴人那張床從前有一位女王睡遇說不定他可以得到一位美麗的女人一同睡在那張床上那時他手裏並不充裕因爲買了這張大床他不得不租一間大點的房子於是他變賣别的東西去付房租結果手邊值錢的東西都賣光了想借錢也無從借起那張大床卒爲别的所有他依遷到月租低廉的小地方去他口袋襄常裝着一根帶子有時向說那是其太太的團裙帶有時說那是某女王的吊襪帶一八五五年一月二十五日夜半满街结了冰他用這根帶子縊死在一家小旅館的窗户格子上勒瓦爾本不愧爲一代的奇才他的死也不同流俗眞可以說奇人有奇死</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（二十八）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>那詩人是愚人那老紳士說我們　惡牠我們　死牠我們用了　榮毒死牠我們將牠綁在木　上活活的燒死牠我一　子用我簡便的辦辦法努力做着神的工作敎他的敵人們笑他們自已可是如果你告訴我那條路上神走遇來了那我也要鑽到最近的耗子洞裏去直至他走過　敢呼息的因爲如果他　見我或是嗔到我他一脚落在我身上像我踏　死什麽破壞了我的誠律的有書的小東西的踏死我可不是說不定的麽那班追求神的人們呌著哦哦我知道什麽地方我原可以找到他的了他們一定自以爲了不得可以站在神前的那個敎士可曾告訴你朱匹忒和塞麥利的故事麽</p>
<p>没有黑女孩子說那個故事是怎樣的？</p>
<p>朱匹忒是神的各個名字中間的一個那老紳士說你知道他有着許多名字罷可不是？　我最近所遇到的那人呌他上帝她說</p>
<p>正是那老紳士說哪哪朱匹忒愛上塞麥利（註）了他眞夠體貼呵他在　上行爲上對她裝得同凡人一樓一樣但是她却自以爲夠得上受極盡紳性的偉大的神的愛了於是她一定要他全身穿了神聖的　甲到她跟前來</p>
<p>（註）朱匹忒的故事見希臘神話</p>
<p>他來的時候怎麽樣？黑女孩子說</p>
<p>如果她早有一點識見呢她一定也料得到那時候要怎麽樣的罷那老绅士說她震地萎縮了像火裏的虱子似的　掉了所以當心些　好　不要做塞麥利那樣的愚人神就在你的臂肘邊他是籌論什麽時候都在那里的可是因了他那神聖的仁慈他不曾露出自身給你看生性你對他認識的太充分不由得要發狂的你爲自已造一個小　罷掘着種着罷削除雜草修剪樹木罷如果他當你圍地上的工作做的不得法的時候碰你的臂肘你做的好的時候祝福你呢你應當满足呵</p>
<p>我們永遠識不得他那完全的風采麽黑女孩子說</p>
<p>是呵那老哲學家說因爲我們要識得他那完全的風采務必待到我們成就了他一切意志而自已也成了神了然而他的意志無限我們又有限得極其短促我們决趕不及他的種種目的了感謝神呵那是於我們再好没有的如果我們的工作做好了呢我們不再有什麽用處那就是我們的末日了爲什麽呢因爲像我們那麽醜陋的短命　他不見得會因爲喜歡看看我們的緣故使我們活下去的所以你進來罷　同着在神的榮光照臨着的這個圍裏耕作罷此外你還是不過問他的好</p>

<h3>自製烟幕</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>每逢一度抗日必有一自造飛雷火箭等武器的宣傅結果只是望梅止渴但聞敵機肆虐不聞飛雷奏效飛雷且然等而下之的火箭只好和花砲中的九龍取水一樣供給小朋友們的元宵玩具　了</p>
<p>近來差强人意的便是粤省工業試騐所自製烟暮告成已在本月五日試騐於中山堂附近空地得到相當的成績據那試驗所長陳堯　的報各略謂烟幕的是戰爭時用以掩護自已軍隊的進退同時又可以淆辭敵人的目標作爲一穏虚者實之實者虚之的策略烟幕分黃藍紫黑白五種就中惟白色的庶蓋力最爲偉大其他諸色連用谥陸海上天色迷　的時候借此可得到掩護和引誘的功用經本所技術人員分组研究製成白色者兩種黃紫色者多種可供抗日時的戰　用品云云吃了敵人烟幕彈的虧才想到自製烟幕似這般的努力已近於臨渴掘井了但臨渴掘井好容易把這口井掘成了因此我得到了自製烟幕的消息認爲一種差强人意的舉動要是宣傅着理想上的破敵利器而結果没有這麽一回事這不是臨渴掘井簡直是臨渴盡井了臨渴畫井便晝的和眞井一般可以解得人家的奇渴麽所以我對於粤省的自製烟幕但願其爲臨渴掘井不願其爲臨渴畫井</p>
<h3>好與爭</h3>
<p>— 火雲明</p>
<p>做出來的醜惡</p>
<p>立定脚跟須擇步放開眼界看施爲</p>
<p>人間多少當行事做出來時始見奇這是清朝乾嘉詩人李雨村的人生觀咏這首詩的動機纯爲了糾正某中書的一付門聯立定脚跟從吾所好放開眼界與物無爭於是李詩人說余以爲從吾所好則未知所好之是否也與物無爭則未知所爭之當否也所好如仁義禮信此可好也否則怪僻邪侈流連荒淫亦可好乎所爭當如忠孝廉節必爭也否則權好誤國傷風敗俗亦無爭科</p>
<p>看這段話想像得他立身處世是如何尊嚴如何謹飭事必選擇然後定其去從這麽作自然在朝爲忠臣廉吏在野爲烈士逹人更可以信仰的他主張應該爭的一定要爭應該好的一定要好而且不宜尚空言必須做出來時至今日香艷肉感的魅惑蘢满了紅與綠的都巿胭脂口紅跳無襪以及露肉的時裝之類沉醉了金圓社會的少爺公子要說不怪癖邪侈流連荒淫似乎太難而仁義禮信給新思想的西裝中國人所唾棄已不是最近的趨勢只要蟭新聞纸的社會版每天登載着匪盜好淫訴訟敲詐决鬥自殺　這便是現代人的所好</p>
<p>關於爭權和利才是比生命更值價而必爭的東西湯玉麟可以廉價出讓熱河省而自已的珍珠財寳却满載二百多車運回天津高唱願爲前驅報效黨國的將軍只是按兵不動却不肯損害自已底實力眞實地與日抗戰這些現象满國皆是而没有人挺身出來和他們爭要說不權奸誤國似乎太難而作俑自喜部屬傚從於國爲不忠父仇不報于私爲不孝收刮民財于吏爲不廉婢膝侍奴於身爲不節傷風敗俗使民族陷於莫大的恥辱還有更甚于這個的嗎　不應好的，却好之如飴，應該爭的，却視若無覩，中國如何會復興？做出來的只是醜恶而已</p>
<h3>陸根榮的懺悔</h3>
<p>— 敏蓀</p>
<p>這似乎是一件悲壯而可喜的事邑·黃陸案的主角陸根榮有從軍的消息。當他出獄之後，他覺得家事如國勢一般的紊亂，治家先得救國，所以他决計的北上從軍去了。臨行的前一夜，他給了一封信·給滬聞人許君，他說·『非殺死一個敵人，非活捉湯玉麟，决不生還。』這話也許是因爲受了過深的剌激而發，但是他自已僅承認是他出獄後對往事的一種懺悔。</p>
<h3>銀幕之下</h3>
<p>— 姚英</p>
<p>看滑稽影片以分析嚴正的目光去批評，這是根本錯誤的··因爲滑稽片的主腦，是胡閙而已。</p>
<p>十五歲以下的兒童，看愛情風月片，適與批評家看滑稽片，同樣的感到乏味　電影明星看自已的試片，没有一個不高興的··然而看完了影片，竟有自問怎麽我有過那麽樣樣的一回事？</p>
<p>女明星的容貌，較男明星的深刻表演　易入人們的腦海··因此女明星日見其多，男明星　没不聞。</p>
<p>中國人不喜歡看國産影片的緣由··是爲的情節表演，中國人都能明瞭的。</p>
<p>抱在手裏的小囡，是不要買票的，所以開演的時候，時常可以聽見啞啊啞啊的啼聲。</p>
<p>售座半元以上的影戲院，地上多的冰淇淋纸杯，可可椰子纸盒，及荷囒水的瓶。半元以下的影戲院，地上多的西瓜子壳，五香豆皮，及各色襯物的小方纸　戴了眼鏡，朗朗的讀說明書，與穿西裝的讀英文字幕，遙遙相對，彼此喋喋不休，這是小影戲院裏的特殊人物　爭坐的心理，是爲着權利起見··散塲時的擁擠，眞有些莫明其妙。</p>
<p>愛看武狹片的，不在看打對子，而在看飛牆走壁，及白光一道，人頭落地。</p>
<h3>嚼冰錄</h3>
<p>魷魚攤充满着在中學校門前。我想受着中等敎育的學生們··總不至於分不明白這是國貨或仇貨，但，可憐的··魷魚攤並不因之生意不靈，學生們堆堆擁擠在攤旁，人家說是日貨他們偏說是廣東魷魚，雖然事實告訴我們虹口那裏有很賤的魷魚出賣，但，信力堅强的中學生仍是在大嚼着，他們深信這是廣東貨，唉，又復何言</p>
<p>影戲院裏在報上登着巨幅廣告，再加上上了午艷，肉感，等字··就足以號召一切，而看客纷至沓來，但，賑災會同一的登載着巨幅廣告，求人賑災，成績終究不如？也許是忘掉子加上肉感二字吧？確然，東北在表現着肉感呢死屍暴露在疆塲上，十足地肉感，只可惜都巿裏人們没有看到罷了，以後我想登這類廣告，最好加上『我們的肉感是貨眞價實，不信請到東北一看方見言之不謬也』！</p>
<p>一個老人死了··下棺材時他的子嬉哭得這樣底凄慘，但，在平時他們時常會駡它『老不死』，其態度何前後矛盾若是？這使我憧憬了好久，但是後來經騐告訴我說··人們是永遠庶蓋僞之下，死了長輩不哀毁盡禮是要受人指摘，即使哭不出（平時盼他死現在當然只有快活原份兒）也得乾嚎幾聲，啊　虚僞的社會，這件只是像徵這社會的一角呢長篇小說</p>
<p>長篇小說</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第一回</p>
<p>推食殷勤偏邀貧女憶　入門慷慨别具武夫雄趙自强似乎也有些知道，回轉臉來向江氏道··老太，你覺得我作事有些瘋瘋顛顛吧？其實不是。我先以爲她是一個闊人的汽車夫狐假威的，在外面闖禍，所以我非和他比一比勢力不可。後來他說出來，也是一個窮人家的兒子，而且他還有些孝心，我自已愛我的父親，當然人家也愛人家的父親我就不能體卹人家一點嗎？江氏笑道··趙連長，您這人心眼兒好，將來一定有好處。趙自强微微一笑，騎着馬走了。江氏走回屋子去，老姑娘迎着母親道··你剛才說誰好心眼兒？江氏於是把趙自强剛才的事說了一遍。因道··眞的，好鐵不打釘，好人不當兵，這話是不對的，像趙連長這種人，又和氣，又爽快能說不是好人嗎？老姑娘笑道··這樣子說，這個街坊，你是願意的了。江氏點點頭道··這種人，别說做街房，交朋友也好攀親戚也好，我都願意呀。老姑娘紅了臉道··你這是什麽話？江氏這才覺悟自已失言，然而是已經庶掩不及了。</p>
<p>第二回</p>
<p>陋室結芳鄰暗欽　叟　權家擇良伴痛詆貪娃</p>
<p>江氏隨口說出的那幾句話·實在没有什麽用意，及至女兒一表示不满，自已也覺的不對，就笑道··這也没什麽關係，我不過說他是一個好人罷了。老姑娘將坑頭邊那個木箱子端了過來，取出甘二爺那包衣料，量着看着，對了那包衣料只是發　。江氏笑道··呵　不是你把這衣料拿出來，我還忘子呢。人家身上還穿着綢面袍子呢，不是着罩袍穿嗎？老姑娘聽說，笑起來了，便道··瞧您這分兒記心。江氏將衣料拿到手　在這坑上量着，老姑娘就替伊拿剪刀，拿灰缐袋，又拿出烙鐵來，打算放到爐子上去燒熱來。（一二）</p>
<p>小引上次我們請了一位不大做文章的名書家丁悚先生做了一篇『躺在板門上』描寫得很動人。這一次又躊一位不大做文章的法律家兼書家董哲香先生也來一下子，篇名『新郎從軍記』</p>
<p>，也自新頴可喜。西湖伊蘭，是董先生給人寫對聯寫堂幅時所用的筆名，在書家中是一塊老牌子了。</p>
<p>各有千秋</p>
<h3>新郎從軍記</h3>
<p>— 西湖伊蘭</p>
<p>我家東隣，不知姓甚，他家有一青年，我家人均呼他爲新郎。因爲他家遷人後過了幾天，這青年便行結緍禮，所以稱他新郎··日久郎舊了，他的名稱仍是新的。此亦可看出上海鄰誼的欠缺。上海里弄中，比户居住，彼此均不相往來，相遇亦各不招呼··甚至一牆之隔，，同居了五七年，尚不知隣居何姓但上海居户，鄰誼雖欠缺，而家僕役間，暇時又最喜說鄰居之是非··『某家太太，與一和尚打架』··『某家姨太太，是個廣能鹽水妹··』</p>
<p>『某家男主人，被老婆捉姦，打了三個收掌；』</p>
<p>但姓名旣不知　，說時如何指明呢？那便有個代替的綽號··什什麽廋長子，大個頭，獨　眼，紅鼻頭，廣東老，蘇州妹等等··都搬來當作姓名。我家弄中，有最怪的綽號二··一爲山東饅頭，一爲满天星。满天星卽新郎的祖母。這三字是否指伊的满頭白髮？不得而知。</p>
<p>一日，黃昏後九點鐘模樣，满天星在家裏大聲哭起來，連接又廳見是兩三個女人哭··鄰人說··『新郎死了。』上海旣　隣誼，他家死了人，與别家没關係。但到第二天，新郎家不見有喪事舉動，鄰人又傅說··『不是新郎死，是新郎逃走了。』又有人說··『不是走，是從軍去了。』從軍二字··合弄中娘姨大姐車夫廚司聚了一堆人，取合議制，討論良久，未得一確解；仍由新郎家傅說這話出來的車夫解釋說··從軍便是打仗，是往東北與東洋人打仗去了。</p>
<p>於是衆人又復懷疑，說··『新郎不是當兵的人；』又說··『他家裏人旣許他去，他昨夜動身時』</p>
<p>，又爲什麽這樣狂哭？』大家聚了許多疑問，衆口齊開、都向車夫包圍。車夫說··『不是昨夜動身，先四日說到南京去看朋友，便走了；昨夜來了快信，說··『···從軍去了，生死不必問···『全家看了信，都哭了，但有件奇事，大家哭了，只有新少奶奶不哭；不但不哭，而且笑說道『好。』車夫講演旣畢，衆人又是懷疑··『說必是新娘子有歹心；』又有人說··『</p>
<p>伊肚子也大了，不致有歹心；必是嚇昏了，得了了瘋狂病。』自此以後··新郎家中不安，弄中人人都不安，人人的不安，因爲弄中隣居，注意他家的事，比注意自已的事來得殷勤！他們每天下午，必要開一次露天會議；走過新郎門前，必要探頭探腦，作一種福爾摩斯的行徑。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>第二次辭職照准</h3>
<p>— 小夥子</p>
<p>這幾天報上閙得最熱閙的，除束北義勇軍與敵拚命肉搏，孫殿英孤軍抗戰外，標題字大的觸人眼晴的就是關於我們的故張大帥的令哲嗣前東北邊防司令長官現北平綏靖主任兼代北平軍分會委員張漢卿少帥的辭職消息！這次辭職理由，據說，因熱主席湯玉麟將軍在熱河實地奉行『不抵抗主義』而不幸未得眞竅致不能試騐成功倒把熱河送掉，湯主席踪，少帥於氣憤之下發了篇通電主張快把湯主席抓來砍頭以洩怨氣，但是中央監察院方面偏生不肯寛宏大量，予以特别宥恕，而要提出彈劾，幸喜我們的張帥眼睛看得穿，肚皮裝得氣不與他們較量（不然又要閙一次監院長辭職，留德，而我們的少帥更來一次兼XX分會委長！然而那時，不亦樂乎？）很慷慨地自動向中央引咎辭職，中央也極爽快，對張便一口氣答應『辭聞照准』（記着，這是第二次『照准』！按第一次時在民國二十有一年八月十六日！）因此，張少帥又趕發下野通電，趕辦交代，趕着乘自備福特飛機到上海來預備出洋；中央就趕忙派大員接收，趕忙佈置守禦進攻與恢復失地的軍事工程，而且還趕忙···總之，這樣一來，全國共忙</p>
<p>浮燥的未經人事的年輕的老百姓聽了這個消息，便喜　若狂鼓掌稱快而流着涙說··『此蛋不滾平津終必不保，京滬也要漸次遭殃··今謹願此去，永永不再回來！』深沉的歷世極深的老年百姓聽了這個消息，便嘆口氣而微笑着說··『本來這孩子太倔强了些！不服老，焉得不失敗？千不該，萬不該，就是不該自作聰明造出一個『不抵抗主義』，而硬要挺身來實着，不然，老實早點退讓，我們的政府自有辦法，而且這時我們的青天日满地紅的鮮艷的國　不是還在揚眉吐氣臨風招展於瀋陽的　頭？三民主義的讀本不是仍舊風行暢銷於『满洲』的各大書坊？···其實，我就這般想『一千句話做一句話說張少帥能臨難（困難也，非國難也）讓賢，終算了不起的大可風行讚頌而不失爲君子國的國民！』吾人應再四思之</p>
<p>行矣，張少帥！請不必猶以都屬殷爲念也（請參觀少帥下野通電），我政府已有妥善處置及籌書華北善後辦法公諸於報端了，至於我輩應該萬死的小民自當源源援助你的部屬，因爲我們已經援助了二十多年，决不致不顧信譽而中途翻侮也！少帥其放心之。行矣，少帥！祝海洋中風平浪無船行安穏好讓少帥在甲板上打高而夫以自娱而消寂愁！并且，伏祈少帥珍得，不宣</p>

<p>常識</p>
<h3>素食對於人身的生理響</h3>
<p>— 添影</p>
<p>『素食』在以前是很引不起一般人的注意，而漠視牠的，似乎這是宗敎中的戒條，於我們身體的營養上，並不起什麽現象。科學一天天的進步，這素食在科學的觀點上，已證明了牠相當的長處所以不但我國又有新發展，就是歐美也有流行的風氣。而以體魄强健和平軍國民敎育著名的德人，多有吃素的嗜好，不過他們是科學化的吃素，不禁富有滋養所牛奶，和雞蛋。現在拿素食最緊要的二種利益，寫在后面</p>
<p>（一）素食能清潔胃腸，增加食量，（當然消化力加强，所以才能增加食量。）</p>
<p>吃下肚去的食品，消化後變成滋養品而滲入血液的很多；不消化而剩成泄物的很少。素食用植物性油類（如荳油，菜油等）代替猪油（動物性油脂）來煎煑食品，所以没有像猪油般滯塞腸胃的性質。你看！多吃猪油的人，他的胃口，一定不好，（除非他食時，多吃些猪油）。這不是個很明顯的例子嗎？</p>
<p>（二）素食能自然的節制性慾的生理衝動。這話驟然聽了，不是覺得佷奇突嗎要知道性慾的衝動，多由於性器官分泌的Ｈormone所發生的剌激現象。促長這物質的東西·實在較能抑止性慾衝動的物質爲多。尤其是接近人類的哺乳動物，　們的肉質和脂物中·含有促進剌激性的分泌物不少。且看僧尼的吃素雖然是佛敎中的信誠戒條，但是試想創立這戒條的佛祖，他决不會憑空的說這話可知素食確於節慾有相當的關係有人想找個適當的方法，能自然的使性慾滅少衝動·做遍了各種行動（穿衣不太暖，日間運動等）終未曾得到一個满意的結果。而在他無意之間·因環境的關係，吃不到魚肉，二個月後，果然逹到了他的目的。雖然，我們不能說素食是唯一可塲的節慾法，但是素食能滅少</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>性慾的衝動，是决無疑義的了。</p>
<p>至於素食何以能節慾？至今尚未十分明瞭　是個容待解的問題。但是，依化學成分的觀察，因素菜中，所含的除糖，澱粉，少量的油脂和淡化合物外含有别種分泌物的很少。不像魚肉類中含有較多量的激剌分泌物，所以不致於興奮性慾</p>
<p>作者並不提倡節慾，但是事實上告訴我們，太頻繁的性慾衝動，是無益而有害於身體的康健，所以無論少年，壯年，無論已婚，未婚，無論與不婚，都有實行節慾的需要，而索食可以節慾　似乎於以前所倡方法之外，另闢一條小路</p>
<h3>I活受罪</h3>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>否認股權</h3>
<p>編者先生</p>
<p>自貴報店員通訊欄出世以來，解答疑難問題，我們直接簡接，得到了許多智識，眞是莫大的幸福呀！現在我一件困難，請先生指示吧</p>
<p>敝友蔡君，節衣縮食，好不容易積蓄了現欵二千元··於民國二十年，合股於南京路ＸＸ綢緞店。因數目太小乃附於該號經理名下，作爲半股。蔡君與經理，素有交誼，故當時並未取得股票。原蔡君之所以搭此股份，無非爲彼方允司賬之職也。年來該號生涯，殊頗不惡··蔡君亦得在店安心供職。不料好事多磨，去年雙方發生口角，因此今春經理將蔡君澈，於是一家五口，生活驟失保障，現擬將自已股本二千元提出，别謀生路。詎料經理竟满口推却，否認蔡君爲該店股東；雙方不免爭論，感情益壞，已成僵局。昨日蔡君移至敝寓問計於余··余才疏學淺，無以應之特將該事始末，詳告先生，請問</p>
<p>（一）蔡君可否向法庭起訴？</p>
<p>（二）因無股單，前途是否有利？</p>
<p>（三）可否追訴紅利？</p>
<p>想先生才識高明，完能予以美满之解答也。專肅即請</p>
<p>撰安　王文逹謹上編者按··蔡君因與經理，素敦良好遽將節衣縮食，歷年積蓄之資，交付於人，而並不取得任何證據，未免大意了些。該店資本，就名義言，二千元袛足半股，當然不尠；但對於僅僅投資半股的股東，就許其享受司賬的利益，顯見内容並不十分充實，蔡君當時，更不能不加以考慮，至少手續方面，似不能稍涉馬虎。現在我國的法律，側重證據這件事，實在有些爲難。不過法律上所謂證據也者，並不限於簽花著押的契約。假使蔡君付欵時。得有經理收條或甚而至於回單，或該號資本賬同，有這件事情的記載。無論收條也回單也賬簿也，祇須有一於此，即可作爲物證，憑之而訴追。即使以上所說的物證均不能提出；那没人證也可以的。譬如交付的時候，或者有在塲的友朋之類均可··但終不若物證之有力耳。我想二千元，爲數不可謂少，决不會私相授受全末有憑證罷。所以蔡君現在應當搜集證據，然後起訴，有了相當證件，勝訴是不難的。不過這些證據，有的袛可證明有這筆欵項，而不能證明牠是股份　我們希望蔡君所找得到的證件，不但可以證明有這筆欵項，而且還可以證明牠是股本；因爲這樣才可以在要求返還資本外，並可追索紅利。萬一不幸。所找到的證據，只能證明有這筆欵項，而並不能證明牠資本，那未紅利部份實在有些無法啓口了。在這種情勢之下蔡君只能要求返還這二千元的本銀以及照長年四厘計算的利息。因爲法律規定，要是借欵時並未規定利率，概照年息四厘計算也。至於你的職務問題在人情上講起來，當然他不該撤你的職可是法律上却不然。你已没有得到股單，當然股單上不會規定『你有充當司賬的權利了』</p>

<h3>；夢裏光陰（三續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>『但是，孩子···自從你到了這裏···之後我們三個人···對於···你···眞比親生···的···更愛惜···更寳貴···我相信···我從没有拒絶過你···你的請求···我已盡量的把···一切···供給你了··所以··我想在··在情理上··在事實上···我終究還可以說是你的恩人！可憐的孩子··你以爲這話可眞嗎··』</p>
<p>『祖父··袓父···』青年底哀痛的答復</p>
<p>『現在，我就用恩人的地位···向你請求』··老人費了好大的力量，才勉强把兩顆眸子移動了幾分，射在青年人底满淌着涙水的臉上。『我請求你，在你的媽媽··我所媳婦，活着··的時候，無論···</p>
<p>老人的最後的掙扎，漸漸地無力了。雖然他的灰白色的嘴唇兀自在一張合地開闔着，但是聲音已細弱到了極點。青年便忙着把一個耳朶凑近他的嘴邊去</p>
<p>『無論人家怎樣··說你··怎樣慫恿你···你··千萬不要離開你的媽媽···她也是很··可憐的···待她也死了···你··你再去找你自已···的母···</p>
<p>可憐的老人，在他没有把自已要說的話盡量發表之前，便奄然物化了『袓父··袓父···袓父』血和涙同時發狂似的奔騰首，老人的床前，量倒了一個無父無母的孤兒</p>
<p>（四）上海的大學堂</p>
<p>一個天上没有半雲庶的新秋的傍晚，寒署表裏的水銀，升到了八十五度以上；在上海，在水門汀鋪满了地，烟灰掩没了天的上海，八十五度眞比别處的九十五度還熱，整個的十里洋塲，彷佛是一具燒得正旺的炭缸。但是遠近各處的人們，却不惜千里跋涉，不惜棄了幽靜而清凉的鄉村，紛紛投到這炭缸裏來。爲的是什麽？誰知道</p>
<p>五點四十分的京滬路的第二次快車，又像一輛拉圾馬車似的打沿線各個車站上，載來了一大批的雜色軍隊，足足有一團人馬。其中有··戴馬拿馬草帽　穿純白色西裝的紳士··有離裸袛差一步的摩登化的太太；有提着大批的土貨的小商人；有掮着一口麻布袋的工農階級；還有穿着爛皺的夏布長衫，挿着　支　來　水算　度　極興奮的　　子</p>

<p>現在世界各國，對於電影事業，提倡不遺飶餘力。他們對於學校方面，雖還没有把電影當作正式課程的敎具看待，但是他們已採用電影作爲補助敎育的工具。每個學校，每年至少終利用夜間或休假的日期，放映數次至數十次的電影。在民衆敎育方面，他們更進一步，認定電影片是民衆的科書，電影院便是民衆學校，對於電影片之提倡介宣傅，取締改進，無不悉心研究，務期逹到盡善盡美，以引起民衆的歡心與興趣。一面對於電影事業，更設法補助，與以種種的便利。因此電影娱樂，幾佔了今日世界各種民衆娱樂中的首位。美國電影事業，最稱發逹，全國有電影院凡二萬五百餘所。德國次之。約五千一百餘所英國又次之，約四千四百餘所。他如法國約三千八百餘所，意國約二千二百餘所。蘇俄約一千一百餘所，日本約二千餘所，都很發逹。不過電影數之多寡，與一國之面積人口，都巿經濟，均有關係。蘇俄土地雖大，而都巿頹少日本人口雖密，而國土不廣。故電影院數，均居下位。我國電影院數，據去处調查，計一百三十五所，前途有增無减，可以斷言　各國之電影敎育運動，可分爲積極的與消極的二種。消極的，即規定種種的審查制度，對於民間製造的影片，嚴厲審查取締。積極的，即從事提倡編製善良的敎育影片，利用於社會敎育及學校敎育方面</p>
<p>各國電影敎育運動之中，各有各的特長和方針。如美國偏重於航空，運動　藝術，社交影片之編製。德國偏重於學術影片编製。蘇俄與意大利則偏重於主義宣傅與文化影片之編製。各國都有特設的電影敎育機關，比較著名的如美國之國立影片檢定所，國立少年電影敎育局，美國電影藝術科學研究會蘇俄之國立文化敎育影片编製所，意大利之國立電影恊會（LUCE）日本之全日本電影敎育研究會等。此外國際聯盟亦特設國際敎育電影恊會，從事電影敎育國際化之研究與實施</p>
<p>現在先來說蘇維埃聯邦的電影敎育運動。列寗曾經說過··『在藝術表現的各種形式之内，電影最有價值』。所以蘇聯認定電影是宣傅主義，建設新社會的最重要的利器。他們特設的國立文化敎育影片编製所，聘請大學敎授與專門家爲監督，從事於科學的研究，以期推行國策。並聯絡全國之愛好電影者，组織蘇聯電影同志會；於各地設立支部，無論各機關的職員，學生，勞働者。赤衛兵，均可加入。現在共有會員三萬五千餘人，支部凡四百餘所。從事於影事業之研究，劇本之編製，不良電影之排斥，電影雜誌之發行，並聯絡巡廻映演隊至内地農村映演電影，以期開發内地文化。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評勦匪勝利（TheTexasBadMan）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在目前電影事業，完全成爲資本主義的生産方式的情形之下，於是有許多爲觀衆所稱許的明星們，便被電影工業家所利用而成爲有機體的生産工具了於是這些明星們，便在攝機前無目的的哭，笑，而這位精於騎射的湯密斯（ＴomMlix）便這様一次復一次的奔馳跳躍，雖然是跌破了頭皮，亦不能喊痛了</p>
<p>如此，湯密斯在這『勦匪勝利一片』</p>
<p>中所必須做到的便是他的騎射，而『勦匪勝利』之所以成爲電影，便是因爲有這樣的一個明星能夠騎射。於是本事的编製以及導演的演出，都是爲了要適合這一個明星</p>
<p>在本片中，湯密斯飾一個武藝驚人的警官。他爲了要獲一個盜魁，扮做匪賊模樣而深入匪窟。其後與匪首之妹發生愛情，不欲加害於愛人之兄土匪首　然而最後終於因一時悮會而殺之　當然的，湯密斯在這中問，和每次一樣的很是賣力，很有他獨到之處，配角中飾匪首的比較還可以，在假扮商人時能夠變换性格，使觀衆不知道這商人即是那拿破崙自命的盜魁，這是難能可貴的，其餘諸人，均屬敷衍塞責罷了　本劇的結構，很是零碎，不能使一般不諳英語的觀衆，得着明確的系統尤其是收尾平庸無味，但導演的技能却是相當好的，全部的情調都很緊張有好些夜景的鏡頭比較還好，因爲燈光運用得還好的原故。不過像偵探或武俠一類的片子，最適宜於採用夜景，因爲這能夠使人們感着恐怖</p>
<p>據我個人的意見，像這樣的故事不如以默片演出來得動人。即就本片的對話就不佔怎樣重要的地位</p>
<h3>花蝴前言</h3>
<p>— 眞眞</p>
<p>花蝴蝶一不是京戲，是電影，是法　　新的電影。二十世紀，是人慾横　的時代，尤其是法國，尤其是　　　華的巴黎，那兒的妖媚的女人，醉人的醇酒，會把一般意志薄弱的青年沈迷着花蝴蝶就是寫這個時代中這般人物的縮影　故事是這樣的</p>
<p>一個流浪的少年，無意中遇到一個飄泊的歌女，兩人情投意合的同居起來後來那少年，成了名，社會上的高等人物，都崇拜他物别的是那些交際花名媛之類，把他死戀着，他禁不位這些人物的引誘，整日整夜沉迷在酒色之中結果，他的英名，也就跟踪着時間像流水一般的過去，那些狂戀着他的交際花，這時候，又换了一個人物去崇拜了，只有在患難相逢的歌女，仍來安慰他</p>
<p>這一齣戲，在演出上，在鏡實上　都顯示法國新頴的作風，而高樂的美麗　更爲自有法國片以來所未有。聽說不久在巴黎公映</p>
<h3>網球聖手柯顯愛脫將登銀幕</h3>
<p>— 趙鵬</p>
<p>法國草地網球國手柯顯愛脫，曾屢次保持台維斯盃錦標，表演委勢　十分優妙，近得法國網球恊進會之允許，担任蒙脫卡羅城俱樂部拍攝影片，表演其擊球之各種姿勢刻已開始攝製，預料於最短期内即可於銀幕上得見柯氏一顯好身手云</p>
<h3>接吻的藝術</h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>接吻，誰都知道是愛的表演。在銀幕上含有羅曼斯一類的影片，中間終有一幕接吻的穿挿，然而戲劇終是戲劇，而接吻必須從内心發出來的感情，才能動人。所以影片上的接吻勢必刻板而不合眞的表現，但演員們對於接吻，却很有專心練習，而能適合於藝術條件的　現在拿演員們各種接吻的姿分析如下　克拉克蓋實接吻的時候，眼睛閉上了一半喉頭並且上下活動的，他如果和　瑪希拉表演接吻時，一宜很動人。據克拉克自已說，他自現身銀幕以來自已覺得最合眞實性的，是和卡路露姆白ＣaroleLomdard的接吻，而對於瑙瑪希拉不敢怎樣放肆，所以還不　眞　琪恩哈羅和却斯脫馬立絲在『紅　婦』一片中的接吻，在軟弱。因爲接吻是很興奮的，軟弱的接吻，就勉强了</p>

<h3>The Brave Soldiers of Song Zheyuan's Troops Kill the Enemy at Xifengkou</h3>
<h3>A Great Victory Again for the Wang and Dong Regiments' Surprise Attack</h3>
<h3>Destroyed 18 Captured Cannons</h3>
<h3>Hacked to Death Three Companies of Enemy Cavalry and Infantry</h3>
<h3>Our Battalion Commander Wang Baoliang Died in Battle</h3>
<h3>Enemy Forces on the Front Dare Not Approach Our Positions</h3>
<p>Beiping, Song Zheyuan's military representative stationed in Ping, Qin Shaowen, reported from Xifengkou today on the 13th regarding the battle situation: the two regiments, Wang Changhai and Dong Shengtang, previously dispatched to attack behind enemy lines, both succeeded. Wang's regiment hacked to death several hundred enemy artillerymen and captured 18 cannons. Due to the difficulty of transporting them on the mountain roads, they took the breechblocks and aiming devices, destroyed the cannons, and burned a large amount of enemy ammunition and supplies. Dong's regiment circled around behind the mountains and advanced into a village, hacking to death one company of enemy cavalry, and then advanced into another village, hacking to death two companies of enemy infantry. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. This morning, a mixed enemy force of Japanese, Mongolian, and Korean troops, about one mixed regiment, carrying four mountain guns, attempted to outflank our right flank from Dongjiakou. Our troops met them head-on and routed them. The enemy on the front, because their cannons were destroyed, now have less artillery fire, and their infantry continue to attack, but dare not approach our positions. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, on the morning of the 9th, Wan Fulin and Song Zheyuan met in Zunhua during a troop rotation. When Japanese troops were spotted, Wan's troops gave chase, and Song immediately dispatched the First Battalion of the Special Forces, Wang Baoliang's entire battalion, with hand grenades and broadswords, rushing to the front line to block the enemy. In one day, they traveled over one hundred li. Wang's battalion used broadswords to engage the enemy's vanguard, the Hattori Brigade, killing over one thousand enemy soldiers. Battalion Commander Wang Baoliang died in battle. Only twenty-odd soldiers remained in Wang's battalion. On the night of the 9th, the second line of defense of Song's troops ambushed the enemy with broadswords, hacking to death another one thousand five hundred enemy soldiers. On the morning of the 10th, the enemy infantry and artillery regiments bombarded our positions for three hours. Our troops retreated from the defense line and hid in the mountains without returning a single shot. The enemy also did not dare to advance. That night, they divided into teams from Xujiakou and Panjiakou to encircle the enemy's rear, surrounding them. Then they charged with hand grenades and broadswords. The enemy was caught off guard and our troops hacked to death over five to six thousand enemy soldiers. The enemy's 13th and 14th Brigades were almost completely annihilated. Many prisoners were captured, mostly Koreans, who were all beheaded. Our troops in Zunhua had approximately one thousand wounded, all with bayonet and machine gun wounds. The value of the spoils of war captured by our troops this time is estimated at approximately twenty million. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Song Zheyuan received reports that the Japanese army had a total of seven brigades invading Rehe. Two brigades attacked Xifengkou and have been eliminated by our troops. The reason for the enemy's failure to attack Xifengkou was that the enemy's invasion of Rehe progressed too quickly, without guarding against surprise attacks. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, on the evening of the 13th, Song Zheyuan's troops, the broadsword and hand grenade teams, launched a fierce attack on Laoposhan outside Xifengkou.

Our officers and soldiers responded calmly, with gunfire at a distance and sword attacks up close. The enemy ultimately did not succeed. During our troops' encircling attack on the evening of the 11th, our regimental commander, Wang Changhai, led his troops to occupy the enemy's artillery position, capturing 18 cannons. Due to the dangerous terrain, only six cannons were transported back. The remaining cannons were completely destroyed. On the 13th, the enemy's counterattack artillery fire was very limited. On the 13th, the enemy used over a dozen large aircraft to relentlessly bomb our lines and the vicinity of Sache Bridge from morning to evening, wounding over a dozen of our officers and soldiers and wounding four civilians. According to intelligence reports, the enemy is dispatching reinforcements of infantry, which are advancing towards our side from Pingquan.

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<h3>The Arms Race Begins to Cloud Over</h3>
<h3>(I) The Reason for the Stalemate in Arms Reduction</h3>
<p>While the sounds of cannons are shaking the territory of Rehe, the high tune of peace is still sung beside Lake Geneva, and the so-called disarmament conference continues. It seems that the major countries in the world all have the sincerity of peace and are willing to reduce armaments, but whether this is actually the case is worthy of our taste.</p>
<p>Since the National Socialist Party of Germany took power, it has been trying to break the status quo and actively seek the development of its country. On the one hand, it wants to break away from all the restraints of the Treaty of Versailles, and on the other hand, it demands that Germany's armament should be equal to that of other countries. For nine years from the European War to the present, the responsibility for the challenge is not really the majority of the German people today. However, the Germans have been punished and bear the responsibility for the war that they should not bear and do not want to bear, so they all express their injustice and sympathize with Hitler, who is turning back the clock and holding narrow nationalism, thinking that Germany will achieve the hope of the masses under Hitler's leadership in the future. Therefore, it threatens Poland in the east and unites Italy in the south, and has the potential to abandon the Treaty of Versailles in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>But why does France remain silent and regard Hitler's leap forward as non-existent? Is it preparing to fight when necessary? Or make considerable concessions in order to seek temporary relaxation? There are three things that France will never let go of in continental Europe. The first is how to maintain its hegemony, the second is how to establish its security guarantees, and the third is how to coerce the Soviet Union so that it cannot develop towards Western Europe.</p>
<p>The capitalist system has developed to the present day, and liberalism is bound to be eliminated, and monopoly is the characteristic of today. Therefore, it is not industrial capital but financial capital that is active in the world. In recent years, the leader of the world's financial capital has been the United States. In Europe, France is in the leading position of financial capital. All European countries are running out of cash and are suffering from unemployment, but France has cash worth more than 82 billion francs, which it uses to rule Europe and to suppress Germany and Italy. As long as the capitalist system exists, Germany is no match for it, let alone after the outbreak of the American financial panic, although it is said that the gold standard system is barely maintained, but in fact it has prohibited the export of cash. Although this has an impact on French finance, it has increased the stability of France's position in Europe. Hitler is called the representative of the middle class and claims to revive the German Empire, but secretly still seeks compromise and understanding with British and French financial capital. Then Germany is bound to bow to the French franc. Since financial capital is the main force, its European hegemony should naturally belong to France.</p>
<p>Italy has never forgotten the arms race, but it has never been able to get out of the Mediterranean. In the past six months, although there have been several fast ships around the world, they can be converted into warships once something happens, but their number is limited and their strength is minimal. The final decision of modern warfare does not depend entirely on weapons, but on the economic conditions of the entire nation. Italy's resources are poor and its industry is backward. Relying only on the genius of the Black Shirt Prime Minister, how can it be an enemy of France? Although Germany is an advanced country, the so-called revival since the war has all relied on foreign investment. Can a country with a narrow market, a mountain of inventory, and 6 million unemployed workers fight a war against the outside world with emotional impulsiveness? Therefore, although Germany is advocating for equal armament, in reality it still lacks the financial resources to expand its armament. Therefore, France's security is still not in much danger, but strict defense is inevitable.</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power, he has done his best to suppress the Communist Party in order to reduce the power of the Communist Party. Although he has not been able to directly infringe upon the Soviet Union, he has given a great blow to the development of the Communist Party in Western Europe. It is also a method of indirectly restraining the Soviet Union, that is, stabilizing capitalism. Since the Five-Year Plan was announced to be completed in four years, although there are still some shortcomings that can be criticized, its impact on the workers of European countries is greater than that of millions of troops, and its reflection on capitalism is even more serious. At this time, the British and French countries were only ordinary anxious about the transformation of the German political situation. Therefore, only by using Hitler and Papen to suppress the rise of the Communist Party's power can they stop the westward advance of the Soviet Union's power. This is also the way to stabilize the current situation in Western Europe and maintain France's hegemony.</p>
<h3>(II) Armaments Stalled, Armaments Began</h3>
<p>Germany is busy suppressing internal changes and is eager for equal armament. France is stimulated by this and expands its armament as it should. Italy should also strive for progress in the Mediterranean Sea. Under this situation, how can England be willing to fall behind? The chaos and serious confrontation in the European situation may become more drastic in the future.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, England is anxious to deal with Europe and needs to be more anxious to maintain its colonies. Therefore, Japan takes the opportunity to expand its army and navy. The army is extending northward from Korea to the Middle East Road line, and westward to the Great Wall. It merges the four northeastern provinces into Japan's sphere of influence. Relying on Fushun's coal, Anshan's iron, Heilongjiang's gold, and Rehe's wool, it can be used for military purposes. To the south, it can further invade North China, and to the north, it will resist the Soviet Union's redification. The domination of the Pacific Ocean will be expanded due to the support of natural resources. Moreover, the most attention should be paid to its southward policy is not the Minyue on the mainland, but the Philippines. Japan wants to dominate the Pacific Ocean and monopolize the Chinese market. Having the Philippines is enough to threaten it, or at least enough to contain its military actions. Therefore, the seizure of the Philippines is one of Japan's national policies and cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the United States of America will increase its unease and anger, and its preparations for the deterioration of the Far East problem will become tighter. The construction of new ships is bound to be processed. Although the financial panic is in full swing, it seems that there is little spare power to engage in military affairs. However, the sudden rise of military industry is also enough to stimulate the general market situation. The United States is both internally agitated by the gold rush and externally threatened by Japan, so its ending is still inevitable to expand its armaments, which is also expected.</p>
<p>In short, disarmament will become a historical term in the future. Peace is indeed an indispensable ideal for human mutual assistance. However, in this period when the arms race is about to return to its original state, peace has almost become a diplomatic table talk. The true international relations should be seen in gunpowder and steel.</p>

Yesterday, I met with the ambassadors and conveyed this idea, that the government has set a policy. Yu Ding will leave Beiping on the 15th and return to Beijing. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US to Conditionally Participate in League of Nations Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>Swiss Minister to the US Appointed as Participating Representative</p>
<p>To Cooperate with League of Nations Consultation but Without Voting Rights</p>
<p>Advisory Committee to Convene Today</p>
<p>Washington: The US government has accepted the League of Nations' invitation to participate in the twenty-one-member Advisory Committee for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: The appointment of Wilson, the US Minister to Switzerland, as the US government representative to the League of Nations Advisory Committee, has been officially announced. As expected, the announcement indicates that the US is unwilling to pre-commit to any resolutions of the Advisory Committee, such as economic sanctions or other threatening plans. Simultaneously released with this announcement is a formal statement explaining the US government's actions in this matter, stating that the promotion of peace anywhere in the world is related to all nations, and the American people have always been willing to participate in efforts to achieve this goal. Therefore, the United States gladly accepts the invitation issued by the Advisory Committee. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Nanjing Diplomatic circles report that the League of Nations Advisory Committee has not yet formally convened due to waiting for responses from Russia and the US. Now that Russia is not participating, and the US has only agreed to cooperate, and given the tense situation in the Far East, a meeting is scheduled for the 15th. Our representative, Mr. Yan, will depart for Geneva within the next few days. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The US government's response to the League of Nations' invitation to participate in the League of Nations Advisory Committee is currently being kept secret. However, it is reported that the response received by the League of Nations from the United States is still preliminary. The US side will need to issue a more concrete document to explain its position and detail the reasons why the US government decided to participate in the work of this committee. Now that the US has agreed to participate, preparations for the Advisory Committee's meeting can begin. Once a more concrete communication is received, the Advisory Committee can be convened within 24 hours. Regarding this matter, it is noteworthy that the chairman of the Disarmament Conference issued a notice today stating that in order to facilitate the meetings of the various committees organized by the League of Nations General Assembly in the next two days, the chairman of the Disarmament Conference has decided not to hold meetings of the General Committee or the Political Committee in the next two days. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the US Note</h3>
<p>Published Simultaneously in Washington and Geneva</p>
<p>Geneva: A joint communiqué released simultaneously in Washington and Geneva indicates the US government's willingness to participate in the work of the Advisory Committee to assist the League of Nations General Assembly in fulfilling its responsibilities regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. The communiqué begins by stating that the US government gladly accepts the Advisory Committee's invitation to cooperate in handling the work entrusted to it by the League of Nations General Assembly. It then suggests a practical plan to facilitate effective cooperation, advocating that the US representative may attend discussions of the Advisory Committee without voting rights. In this way, the US representative would not have the status of a League of Nations member, but would only be of a consultative nature, and the US government would not relinquish its independence of judgment and freedom of action. The US representative cannot take actions that bind the United States. The communiqué concludes by stating that we are confident that the League of Nations and the United States have a common interest in this issue, and that it is important to exchange information and opinions quickly and accurately, and that there should be free and frank discussions between the countries. Such procedures should help achieve the objectives sought by the United States and the countries concerned. Secretary of State Hull has attached a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, stating that he is pleased to inform him that the US government is prepared to cooperate with the Advisory Committee in a manner it deems appropriate and feasible. The US government believes that it is necessary to exercise independent judgment regarding any recommendations that the committee may make or any actions it may advocate. Therefore, it does not seem appropriate to appoint a representative to perform the duties of a member of the committee. However, I believe that the participation of the US government in the committee's discussions can be beneficial. Therefore, I have now instructed Wilson, the US Minister to Switzerland, to be prepared to participate when needed, but without voting rights. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Arms Embargo Issue</h3>
<p>Tokyo: This afternoon, British Ambassador Lindley visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify that the British government has decided to lift the ban on arms exports to both China and Japan. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The twenty-one-member Advisory Committee organized by the League of Nations Extraordinary General Assembly to continue observing the Sino-Japanese dispute will meet tomorrow or the day after to discuss the issue of banning arms exports. The United States has formally announced its willingness to participate in this committee and has raised the issue of a unified ban on arms exports by all countries. The US response seems to have been delivered to Geneva. The United States seems to agree with the principle of unified action by all countries, but has put forward several conditions. The content of the conditions has not yet been determined. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Guo Qinqi, the Chinese Minister to the UK, welcomed the British government's decision to lift the arms embargo, saying that this move by the British government not only took into account the general sentiments of China, but also the influential public opinion within Britain itself. China and the League of Nations felt that the initial ban, which did not distinguish between China and Japan, was inconsistent with the responsibilities outlined in the League of Nations General Assembly report. But this situation is now clear. China is pleased to hear that Britain does not want to take any action that would make the victims of aggression feel unfairly treated. He hopes that Britain can now take the lead in seeking a unified action among League of Nations member states and non-member states to extend the authority of the League of Nations Covenant and various peace treaties, and promote the establishment of a just peace in the Far East. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Lord Privy Seal Baldwin declared in the House of Commons today that the British government had banned the export of arms to the Far East. This measure can only be effective if it is adopted unanimously by all countries. Unexpectedly, although the British government contacted various countries, none of the governments were willing to follow suit. In such a situation, it would be futile for the British government to act alone, so it has decided to lift the ban from today. However, the British government will continue to strive to ensure that all countries can eventually agree on this point. He hopes that the member states of the League of Nations will soon endorse Britain's proposal. Labour Party leader Lansbury criticized the government for failing to make sufficient efforts to eliminate the dispute. Baldwin replied that no country other than Britain can prohibit the transportation of arms to the Far East. Member of Parliament Colville questioned the situation of arms being transported to the Far East. Baldwin replied in writing that in February of this year, the government issued licenses for the following arms to be transported to China: 20 .303 caliber machine guns and 20,000 rounds of ammunition, and 6 million rounds of 7.92 ammunition. No arms were transported to Japan. As of February 17, applications for licenses still under review included: 13 .303 caliber machine guns and 67,000 rounds of ammunition ordered by China, and 150 7.7mm machine guns and accessories being transported to Japan. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations Issue</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the consultation on the withdrawal from the League of Nations, the Privy Council's chairman, Kuratomi, carefully examined the committee's members. Today, he appointed Baron Hiranuma as the chairman of the review committee, and the members were submitted to the review committee for consideration. The chairman was Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, and the members were Arai Kentarō, Kamata Eikichi, Tomita Masaaki, Hara Yoshimichi, Kawai Misao, Arima Ryōkitsu, Ishii Kikujirō, Viscount Kurino Shinichirō. The first review committee meeting is scheduled to close on the 18th or 20th. (Dentsu, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The government's notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations, which was consulted by the Emperor, was submitted by the Privy Council Chairman Tomita to the review committee for deliberation. The committee will have in-depth questions regarding the responsibility of the government for having to withdraw from the League of Nations and the fundamental foreign policy after the withdrawal. However, the Privy Council's approval of this case is largely confirmed. When the government notifies the League of Nations later this month, it will also clarify to China and foreign countries that Japan is still striving to maintain world peace.

<h3>Wang Jingwei Passes Through Hong Kong to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Li Zongren and Li Jishen Board the Ship to Meet Him</p>
<p>Hong Kong: At 8:00 AM on the 14th, Zeng Zhongming arrived in Hong Kong on a French mail ship to welcome Wang. At around 10:00 AM, the Aramis arrived in port. Those arriving on the ship included Wang Jingwei and his wife, as well as their daughter, Binbin. In addition to Zeng, more than 30 people welcomed them at the pier. Wang stated that he originally went to France for medical treatment. Recently, he heard that Yushu and Rehe had fallen one after another, so he returned to the country despite his illness. After arriving in Shanghai, he will transfer to Nanjing and will not stay long. After the Northeast was occupied, he discussed resistance with Zhang Xueliang, but there were no results. China is in the right and has gained the sympathy of various countries. The League of Nations' judgment on the Sino-Japanese dispute based on Article 16 of the Covenant seems to be quite a victory for us. However, a large part of Rehe fell in less than ten days of war, which is truly inexplicable. It is truly regrettable that our troops, which were many times larger, retreated without a fight. He believes that the only option is resistance. He dares to take responsibility and say that there will never be a compromise with Japan. The ship is scheduled to leave Hong Kong at 9:00 PM for Shanghai. Wang returned to the ship after attending a banquet held by Hong Kong gentry in the afternoon. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, who went overseas for medical treatment, has now returned to the country and has left Hong Kong, scheduled to take the Aramis mail ship to Shanghai this afternoon. Before leaving, he granted an interview to a Reuters reporter. Wang appeared to be in good health. It is said that he intends to immediately enter Nanjing and resume his administrative duties. His view of actively resisting Japanese aggression has not changed. His advisors had advised him to stay in Europe for some time, but due to the critical situation in North China, he had to return early. He was very pleased that the League of Nations report proved that China had gained the sympathy of various countries. However, he observed that European sentiment was that China should do something on its own. Therefore, he believes that efforts in Geneva must be supplemented by strong resistance. Wang does not believe Chiang Kai-shek is plotting a compromise with Japan, saying that the time for compromise has long passed. Wang was very surprised by Zhang Xueliang's loss of power. Although Wang did not criticize Zhang, he felt that in this environment, his resignation should be approved. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

The majority of withdrawals are for the payment of salaries and daily needs. The New York Federal Reserve Bank also allows member banks to conduct limited foreign exchange transactions beyond reserves to meet the urgent needs of customers. However, there are no formal opening prices, and customers must submit a written statement that they have not violated the government's emergency orders. All opening prices are: Canadian gold dollar 86.50, Hong Kong silver dollar 24.50, Shanghai tael 31, Indian rupee 25.80. The above four types of transactions are extremely limited. There are slightly more transactions in European currencies: British pound 3.45, French franc 3.95, German mark 2.39. The directors of the New York Stock Exchange have instructed all members to prepare everything in anticipation that the board of directors will decide to send order forms to all members on the 14th.

<h3>Japan's Budget Increases Again</h3>
<p>Totaling 2.3 Billion</p>

If combined with the total budget of 2.2399 billion yuan passed by both houses, the total general accounting budget for the eighth year of Showa actually reaches more than 2.3 billion yuan. At the same time, the amount of public bonds issued will be 17.54 million yuan, the planned amount for the issuance of public bonds for the source of the general accounting supplementary budget, which, combined with the established amount of 987.95 million yuan, also reaches 1.0055 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Political Turmoil in Japan</h3>
<p>Cabinet Secretary Resigns Due to Son's Communist Affiliations</p>
<p>The Saito Cabinet is on the Verge of Internal Collapse</p>
<p>Dentsu telegram from Tokyo on the 14th: The realization of the resignation of Cabinet Secretary Shibata is considered by some to be a delaying tactic of the current cabinet, but in reality, it is the opposite. Shibata's resignation is due to his son's involvement with communism. This issue is related to an unexplained incident involving a judicial official, and Justice Minister Oyama should also be held responsible. It is also related to a certain case in Nagano Prefecture, and Minister of Education Hatoyama also bears great responsibility. Now that Shibata has left, the responsibility issues of the Justice Minister and Minister of Education are likely to become more serious. Furthermore, when Finance Minister Takahashi met with Suzuki Masayo, president of the Seiyu Party, last December, he expressed his intention to retire bravely after the end of the Diet session. Now that the Diet has adjourned and the procedures for implementing the budget have been completed, Finance Minister Takahashi is bound to retire. At the same time, Justice Minister Oyama will also resign after the investigation of the unexplained incident is completed. Therefore, the Saito Cabinet will inevitably collapse internally in May or June.</p>

<p>Germany States that Party Members are Not Military or Police</p>
<p>Guomin telegram from Strasbourg on the 13th: Today, the French border is very agitated due to unconfirmed news that a large contingent of unofficial German troops is conducting tactical exercises near Freiburg. Although the details are not yet known, the news quickly spread everywhere. Border officials immediately increased the number of border patrols and made passport checks even stricter. Those on leave from the army were ordered to cancel their leave. Rumors spread that the German unofficial troops were equipped with the latest weapons, causing the French authorities to prepare in haste.</p>
<p>Havas telegram from Paris on the 13th: Armed National Socialist Party members in Germany temporarily occupied the barracks in Gehl, near the Rhine River bridge. France believes that Gehl is within the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, so it considers this move by the National Socialist Party to be a violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently investigating the circumstances. The French ambassador to Germany, Ponset, will soon lodge a protest with the German government.</p>
<p>TASS telegram from Berlin on the 13th: Soviet Ambassador to Germany Hingkik has, in accordance with instructions from Moscow, delivered to German Foreign Minister Nürath the Soviet government's protest against the anti-Soviet remarks made by National Socialist Party Chancellor Hitler in his speech on March 3.</p>
<p>Reuters telegram from Geneva on the 14th: The dispute between Poland and Danzig has been resolved through negotiation. Poland has agreed to withdraw its troops stationed at Westerplatte near Danzig. The agreement is now awaiting approval from the League of Nations Council. Guomin telegram from Geneva on the 14th: The League of Nations Council briefly discussed the dispute between Poland and Danzig this morning and ruled that Poland's actions were contrary to existing treaties. Polish Foreign Minister Beck then announced that the Polish government intended to immediately withdraw the additional troops it had sent.</p>
<p>Reuters telegram from Geneva on the 14th: The agreement on the dispute between Poland and Danzig was accepted by the League of Nations Council today.</p>
<p>Guomin telegram from Berlin on the 14th: Reuters telegram: It is reported that British political circles are paying close attention to the fact that the National Socialist Party Stormtroopers have occupied Kellsbeia and Kerolye, three places in the Rhineland region that are not set up for military defense. According to semi-official circles, this matter has already passed, and the National Socialist Party members in Kell have gone to work in the countryside last week. Such groups cannot be equated with the military or police for a time, and they are not armed.</p>
<p>Reuters telegram from London on the 13th: The occupation of Koloyesbeya and Kells by the National Socialist Party Stormtroopers has become a matter of careful consideration in the official field. The most important issue now is the nature of the Stormtroopers. If the Stormtroopers are a military force, then Germany has violated the treaty. If they are police, then the matter is relatively easy to resolve.</p>
<h3>British-French-Italian Liaison?</h3>
<p>British-French-American Cooperation?</p>
<p>MacDonald Busy Making Peace</p>
<p>Davis Will Hurry to Mediate</p>
<p>Reuters telegram from Washington on the 13th: According to today's news, American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, will soon go to Europe. Davis's sudden trip to Europe is enough to show President Roosevelt's active participation in seeking to break the deadlock in the Disarmament Conference and alleviate the tense situation in Central Europe. After Roosevelt and Davis discussed the German and Far Eastern issues last Friday, Davis was still appointed as the American chief representative to the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Havas telegram from London on the 13th: French Ambassador to England Flory Vaud went to the Foreign Office today to discuss the military activities of the German National Socialist Party. In particular, he paid attention to the recent demonstrations by National Socialist Party members in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. It is generally believed that experts from the United Kingdom and France have studied the legal issues raised by the recent events in Germany and sent the conclusions to Prime Minister MacDonald, who is currently in Geneva. According to political figures, British jurists concluded that the actual situation created by the recent events in Germany (such as the National Socialist Party troops being incorporated into the police auxiliary force) is incompatible with international law arising from various existing treaties (including the Treaty of Versailles). Extremely important talks between the United Kingdom and Italy will take place in the near future. Prime Minister MacDonald intends to express to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that a certain country has already recognized its desire to amend the treaty by force. If Italy closely liaises with such countries, the risks that Mussolini is taking are significant.</p>
<p>TASS telegram from Moscow on the 13th: A reporter from the Istvan State newspaper in Paris telegraphed that the French government, taking advantage of its good economic situation, announced a plan on March 8 to raise 100 million francs to reorganize public finances. Observers here generally believe that the US government, in view of the economic panic, will change its domestic and foreign policies. The US will strive to consolidate its economic relations with the UK and France. British-French cooperation to aid the US economy will result in a situation of political cooperation between Washington, London, and Paris. Havas telegram from Geneva on the 13th: According to semi-official British sources, when British Prime Minister MacDonald met with French Foreign Minister Pongu yesterday afternoon, the British Prime Minister seemed to strongly urge France and Italy to quickly reach a new compromise so that the Disarmament Conference could effectively stipulate the issue of naval reductions in the future disarmament convention.</p>
<p>Havas telegram from Geneva on the 13th: From 3:15 pm to 4:45 pm today, British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Foreign Minister Pongu discussed the disarmament issue. On the British side were Foreign Secretary Simon, and on the French side was Massigli. Although the talks were quite friendly, Pongu continued to resist MacDonald's proposed solutions. MacDonald successively rejected the solutions that Pongu did not approve of: (1) Extending the Disarmament Conference would not only fail to resolve the existing difficulties but would also cause public opinion in various countries to become uneasy; (2) Calling a meeting of a small number of countries was also not something that Pongu could agree to; (3) Calling a meeting of the majority of countries with the intention of forming a triangular compromise between the UK, France, and the US was also something that US public opinion was unwilling to do. MacDonald is preparing to campaign separately to the delegations of various countries to greatly reduce military armaments so as to change the attitudes of Germany and Italy. French Foreign Minister Pongu does not agree with the above three solutions. His opinion is completely different from MacDonald's. As for the level that disarmament can achieve security, the opinions also differ. Pongu stated that France believes that disarmament is linked to security. There must be security first, and then equal disarmament can be carried out according to the level of security. France can only decide to greatly disarm after France's proposed security construction and disarmament plan can be realized. Furthermore, due to the current events in Germany, France cannot sign any disarmament convention that does not meet the following conditions: (1) The level of disarmament must be equal to the existing level of security; (2) A long-term and effective international monitoring system must be stipulated; (3) Guarantee clauses must be included so that signatory countries have legal recourse in the event that Germany suddenly restores its armaments. Pongu concluded that the best way to overcome the difficulties is to entrust the chief rapporteur, Czech Foreign Minister Pinyes, to compile various suggestions into a case and submit it to the Disarmament Conference immediately as a basis for decision-making. MacDonald and Pongu decided to continue exchanging views.</p>
<p>Guomin telegram from Geneva on the 13th: Although the French side has been trying its best to postpone the Disarmament Conference until after Easter so that the important issues can be postponed for another six weeks, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon are still working hard to find some intact objects from a pile of damaged objects. According to what is being reported outside today, MacDonald et al. are currently trying to first conclude a preliminary treaty on what the Disarmament Conference has achieved so far. However, judging from the recent situation, Germany and Italy are already firmly opposed to it, so even if it can be established, it will not be very effective.</p>
<p>Guomin telegram from Geneva on the 13th: Today, British Prime Minister MacDonald, Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, Czech Foreign Minister Pinyes, and the US representative met for a long time and resolved to postpone the Disarmament Conference until Thursday. Although officials call this a temporary postponement caused by the League of Nations Council and the advisory committee on the Sino-Japanese dispute, the general public regards this as the first step in cleaning up the Disarmament Conference. The German delegation is still adhering to its original proposal and awaiting new instructions from the government.</p>
<h3>Peruvian Revolution</h3>

Defense commander Yemina Qiang and police chief Cas de Luo are personally leading the revolutionary army.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Commemorates the 50th Anniversary of Marx's Death</h3>
<p>TASS telegram from Moscow on the 14th: Today is the 50th anniversary of the death of Karl Marx, the founder of scientific socialism and the international socialist movement. Marx died in London on March 14, 1883, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. Memorial meetings are being held in all towns and state-owned and collective farms in the Soviet Union. At the same time, exhibitions are being held to display Marx's biographies and works, as well as Lenin's works. The Marx Institute is also publishing a special collection of works by Marx and his friend Engels. The State Publishing Bureau is printing 3 million pamphlets outlining Marx's theories. There are also special commemorative events in Leningrad. Newspapers are claiming that Marx's theories have been realized in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Recent Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>(Original by Molotov)</p>
<p>Signing Non-Aggression Treaties is a Huge Diplomatic Victory</p>
<p>Consistently Expressing Strict Neutrality on Far East Issues</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the sympathy of the working masses of all countries for the Soviet Union has greatly increased during the years of the Five-Year Plan. This cannot but be said to be a major consolidation of the Soviet Union's international position. At the same time, the fact of the Soviet Union's mutual relations with various countries also proves this point. For example, the signing of many mutual non-aggression treaties in the past year is clear proof.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's relations with various countries are a matter of course. Although the governments of some countries have changed repeatedly, the Soviet Union's foreign relations are determined by the development of its own strength. Then, this relationship will naturally be consolidated with the victory of the Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>Germany occupies a special position in the Soviet Union's foreign relations. Among the countries that have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, only Germany has the closest economic relations with the Soviet Union. This is not accidental but is due to the interests of both countries.</p>
<p>In addition, the visits to the Soviet Union by the Prime Minister of the Republic of El Salvador, Ismael Braz and the Foreign Minister of Switzerland, Rudby, also promoted the two countries to join hands and make them more consolidated. Due to the international environment and the general interests of peace, the need for El Salvador and the Soviet Union to join hands has become even greater. Everyone knows that the two leaders of the Republic of Turkey signed many practical cultural and financial agreements in Moscow.</p>
<p>There are also some new facts in the development of the Soviet Union's foreign relations last year that are worth mentioning, such as the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union. The breakdown of relations between China and the Soviet Union was initiated by the Chinese government on the day. Today, the restoration of relations between the two countries is also due to the Chinese government's automatic proposal, and the Soviet government has given its full consent. We believe that the mistakes made in the relations with the Soviet Union have been corrected as a result, and the Soviet government has not prevented its correction.</p>
<p>Two or three countries are said to be still discussing the issue of establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Some people are said to still believe that it is necessary to specially study the Soviet Union. For example, the ministers of Czechoslovakia have been studying the Soviet Union in depth for less than a year, but the benefits derived from this can be said to be nothing. This old tune has been sung for more than ten years. The existence of the Soviet regime has been fifteen years, and the establishment of the Soviet Union has been more than ten years. Let's leave this aside for the time being. Following Czechoslovakia are the ministers of countries like the United States who often ask what exactly the Soviet Union is. Especially after the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, this question should be clarified and cannot be delayed any longer. It is not difficult to predict how strong the Soviet Union's power has become, how great its development has been, and how much its international significance has increased. In addition, those countries that have no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and suffer the most losses are those who talk about studying the Soviet Union in particular.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Discusses the European Situation and the Trends in German and Italian Politics</h3>
<p>World Political Organizations Mostly Trend Towards Dictatorial Systems</p>
<p>Germany Recently Has a Tendency Towards One-Party Rule</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy for inspecting European industry, returned to Beijing two days ago. Yesterday, he gave a speech on the current situation in Europe and the political trends in Germany and Italy, as follows:</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the global economic panic, most European countries are showing signs of depression and unrest. This situation is particularly evident in the most developed industrial nations. This is clearly demonstrated by the decrease in foreign trade figures and the increase in unemployment in various countries. Furthermore, in order to rescue themselves from their predicaments, governments in various countries are increasingly emphasizing protectionism and industrial rationalization in their economic policies, and trending towards dictatorial systems in their political organizations. This idea has permeated almost all of Europe, even reaching the rest of the world. Britain, once a representative of free trade, has now adopted protective tariffs and even advocates for a planned economy. Britain, also the birthplace of party politics, saw Prime Minister MacDonald, disregarding his position as leader of the Labour Party, form a coalition cabinet with representatives from various parties to cope with the current difficulties. This is enough to represent the current political and economic trends in Europe. However, the implementation of protective tariffs by various countries has created a kind of economic nationalism, which has led to a decline in foreign trade, a decrease in production, and an increase in unemployment. As people's lives become difficult, social order becomes unstable. If this continues, even the wealthiest countries will inevitably move towards bankruptcy and become beyond repair. Countries are already aware of this and are about to use international conferences to resolve this common crisis. However, there is still a lack of sufficient mutual understanding among countries. When considering common issues, they tend to focus on their own interests. Moreover, this matter is directly and indirectly related to major international issues such as war debts, reparations, disarmament, and peace in East Asia. The involvement of any of these issues is enough to affect the negotiations. Therefore, it is difficult to predict at this time whether it can be resolved satisfactorily in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the trend of the German political situation, recent observations suggest a possible trend towards one-party rule. The German people, stimulated by the defeat in the war, have a strong ambition to strive for self-improvement. However, the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and the impact of the global economic panic have prevented this excellent and promising nation from escaping the pit of fire. Their pain and resentment are beyond words. In addition, Germany is bordered by Britain and France to the west, and Russia and Italy to the east, making it geographically a center for various ideologies. The general youth not only feel deeply oppressed by the environment but are also stimulated by the propaganda of ideologies. Combined with the pain of life, their emotions are becoming increasingly激越. As a result, the political struggle in Germany is becoming increasingly acute. The Communist Party represents the left wing, the National Socialist Party represents the right wing, and the Social Democratic Party defends the Weimar Constitution and occupies the middle ground. The other parties, such as the Catholic Center Party, the National People's Party, the Bavarian People's Party, and the German People's Party, each based on their own special positions, sometimes unite and sometimes separate, manipulating the situation. For the past three years, they have been arguing and fighting fiercely, each refusing to yield. As a result, the German government has been unable to stabilize. In the two elections last year, the National Socialist Party unexpectedly became the largest party in the Reichstag. Hitler's reputation was at its peak. After the Schleicher cabinet fell, President Hindenburg had no choice but to entrust Hitler with the position and place his trusted Papen in the deputy position. This was a major turning point in German politics. Since Hitler has come to power, backed by his many party members, he is bound to make changes to German policy. Hitler's rise to power is clearly unfavorable to the Communist Party, and it is inevitable that the Communist Party will not cause trouble. Therefore, as a preemptive measure, he issued orders to inspect news, post, and telegraph to prevent the activities of the opposition parties, and ordered the dissolution of the Reichstag for a re-election on March 5. During my (Kong's self-reference) return trip, I heard that Hitler had won a complete victory. Hitler's hope of controlling the Reichstag has now been fulfilled. In my observation, this is because the German people have suffered from the pain of political instability for many years. Since Hitler has come to power, they have been willing to support him further, so that he is not constrained by the Reichstag and can exert his political talent and relieve the people's pain. Secondly, the Communist Party set fire to the Reichstag, which has historical value of national glory, a fact that stirred up the German people's disgust. This has caused a kind of disgust and hatred for the Communist Party among the slightly more clear-headed and stable people. This change in the people's psychology, I believe, is the main reason for the victory of the National Socialist Party. Although Hitler has won a great victory, he still faces many difficulties in the future. First, the policies advocated by Hitler are too high and too big, such as abolishing the Treaty of Versailles, solving the unemployment problem, implementing social insurance, and nationalizing monopoly industries. These slogans are indeed the general demands of Germany at present, but they are by no means easy to realize. Secondly, although the two major enemies, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, have been suppressed, their potential forces cannot be eliminated in a short period of time. If Hitler's policies cannot be realized, the opposition parties can take the opportunity to rise again. Thirdly, Hitler's party members are mostly middle-class elements. How their future policies can harmonize the interests of all classes is also a problem. According to recent reports, Hitler's party members are taking advantage of the aftermath of the war to threaten the opposition parties everywhere, causing tension among people around the world, especially in France and Britain. If it is handled too aggressively, it is also questionable whether it will provoke international condemnation. However, Germany has been under the pressure of the Treaty of Versailles for a long time. Once it has a courageous talent, and it shares the same feelings with Italy, although it is not easy to deal with both internal and external affairs, I believe that it will be able to break through the difficulties and shine a different light for the Germanic nation. The principles of the Weimar Constitution and Hitler's主張have many differences. Some of its articles may be amended. If the domestic and foreign situations are serious, Hitler may imitate Mussolini and announce a dictatorship. Observing Hitler's recent order to change the national flag, it seems credible that Hitler has great determination for the future of Germany.</p>
<p>As for Mussolini's rule in Italy, it has been eleven years since its inception. In the past ten years, Mussolini has used his iron fist and perseverance to cope with Italy's difficult environment, and his national foundation has become increasingly solid. Mussolini's personal reputation at home and abroad has also greatly increased. This is indeed worthy of our attention and admiration. From a diplomatic point of view, Mussolini's past diplomatic policies have been quite successful, and there are no signs of change in the near future. The Italian government is currently continuing its friendly relations with Turkey, Hungary, and Soviet Russia, but an understanding between France and Italy is still difficult to establish. Recently, after Hitler, the leader of the German National Socialist Party, came to power, Mussolini showed great sympathy for him. In the future, the relationship between Germany and Italy will inevitably become more friendly. All levels of Italian society are very enthusiastic and work very seriously, accurately, and unusually seriously. For example, the arrival and departure times of trains are never late, and the management of ships is also better than other countries. All of this is enough to show Italy's emerging image. In terms of construction, there has been considerable progress in the past year. Large factories are standing tall, and the scale is extremely grand. The Roman Mussolini Stadium is also quite spectacular. The stadium is built on the banks of the Tiber River in Rome, with mountains behind and water in front, with excellent scenery. Among the great competition venues in Europe, this venue should occupy one of them. There are many great monuments around the stadium, many of which were built by Mussolini. There are many accomplishments to be made. As for the important work of the government this year, it will be the implementation of the agricultural village water conservancy and cultivated land development plan near Rome. The southern Italian countryside, which has been slightly neglected in the past, is now also planning to revitalize it. The content of the plan will be to build new villages in various places to allow city residents to move to the countryside and engage in farming to increase social production. Mussolini also knows that this plan has considerable difficulties, but he believes that the need for the environment and the fact that city gentlemen have gradually been able to live comfortably in the countryside and that many young people are also willing to enter agricultural universities to study and manage rural areas, so he believes that future national construction should focus on rectifying the countryside. Recently, Italy has also been affected by the global economic panic, but domestic industries are still more developed than other countries, and there is still considerable surplus capacity for construction every year. Moreover, Italy advocates labor-capital cooperation, so there is less unemployment in the country, which is also a very good phenomenon. In addition, there is one point that deserves our special attention, namely Mussolini's advocacy of expanding the number of Fascist Party members and absorbing the Italian people into the party. Mussolini has recently realized that one-party rule can only adapt to a certain environment and a certain period of time and is difficult to last for a long time. After a party seizes power, its needs gradually disappear, and drawbacks gradually increase. It is not easy to continue to maintain it. However, Mussolini believes that if the Fascist Party is dissolved at this time, it is not only not the time, but it is also impossible in fact. In order to avoid the occurrence of drawbacks, it is best to expand the number of party members. If the number of party members in the party increases to 2 million (currently there are 1,176,883 people), then the party will disappear invisibly. Because the excellent members of the country are party members, the party members will become ordinary citizens, and all internal disputes in the party can be avoided in the future, etc.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province Prepares to Send Troops to Aid Rehe</h3>
<p>New Proposals from Provincial and Municipal Party Departments</p>
<p>Transfer National Party Fees to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence. In view of the critical state of the nation, Hunan party, government, and military officials are actively carrying out national salvation movements, such as holding a provincial-wide general mobilization week for resisting Japan and suppressing the communists. Recently, He Jian, with the Fourth Route Army under his command, which includes Wang Dongyuan, Li Jue, Peng Weiren, Tao Guang, Chen Guangzhong, and Chen Quzhen's six divisions, except for Tao and Chen (Guangzhong)'s two divisions and one part of Wang's division ordered to enter Jiangxi to suppress bandits, the rest are preparing to transfer two divisions north to resist Japan. Yesterday, he telegraphed Chairman Jiang and Minister He for instructions and waited for orders to be issued. The telegram roughly stated: "The Japanese invaders are advancing rapidly, Chengde has fallen, the barriers have been completely removed, and North China is shaken. Thinking of the future, I am deeply saddened and angry. I only believe that at this time, when the country and the nation are in a critical state, if we can catch up in a hurry, it is not too late to make amends. I sincerely hope to encourage morale and provide final support to central Hunan. I have been actively preparing to send troops to kill the enemy for the public good, and I am looking forward to Yan and Yun with tears."</p>
<p>The Changsha Municipal Party Department and the Public Law Group telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting that the national party fees be temporarily used as military expenses to resist Japan in order to enrich military food. At the same time, they sent telegrams to the party departments of various provinces and cities and various public law groups, requesting that they unanimously advocate their telegram to the central government, stating: "The atrocities of the Japanese are infuriating to both gods and men. The prestige of the League of Nations has been destroyed, and the hope of peace has been cut off. Recovering lost territory and washing away the shame of defeat can only be achieved through resistance to the death. There is no other plan. However, the execution of soldiers relies on the soldiers' efforts to risk their lives, and it is funded by the people's unity in sacrificing their homes to relieve the difficulties. The comrades of our party, who have been nurtured by the ideology and cherished the ambition of sacrifice, should devote themselves to the country in this autumn of national crisis. Although it is difficult to completely join the army and serve on the border, it is appropriate to save on food and clothing and go to the national disaster together. Today, the situation is dangerous, and the country can be destroyed at any time. Apart from purchasing equipment and raising military expenses, there is no important work. Since ancient times, the military has been fighting against thieves, and the supply of equipment is the most difficult. In this time of rural economic bankruptcy, it is really impossible to search. Although patriotism is passionate, it is difficult to persuade contributions. When encountering extraordinary changes, there must be extraordinary responses. Our party has always taken the interests of the party and the country as the premise. At this time, when the treasury is empty and the people's wealth is exhausted, and it is extremely difficult to raise military expenses, the national party fees should be temporarily used for military expenses to resist Japan. We should raise our voices to advocate and order all subordinate military and civilian organs to report and abolish all unnecessary projects and costs that can be saved. Even if it is a matter of ceremony that cannot be abolished, it should be economical. Other unnecessary entertainment expenses in officialdom should be absolutely prohibited. If the Japanese invaders are not eliminated for one day and the lost territory is not recovered for one day, the land of China will sink and there will be no place to bury the dead. How can individuals enjoy themselves? The only plan for today is to inspire the conscience of the whole country, embrace the ambition to break the boat, unite the enemy, and not want money. The martial arts are not afraid of death, and they are working together to raise funds, purchase equipment, train troops, and kill the enemy. Only then can people's hearts be encouraged, morale can be strengthened, and the survival of the country is at stake. The time is pressing and cannot be delayed. Should it be approved quickly? (March 10th)"</p>
<h3>Zheng Jicheng's Statement After Being Pardoned</h3>
<p>Claims He Did Not Feel Pain in Prison</p>
<p>Plans to Kill Enemies for the Country After Release</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. Last year, Zheng Jicheng was arrested and imprisoned in Jinan for assassinating Zhang Zongchang. After the party departments at all levels telegraphed the central government to request a special pardon, the local court tried the case and ruled that Zheng had premeditated murder but that there were extenuating circumstances, reducing the sentence to seven years and several months of imprisonment. The Ministry of Justice, taking into account both legal and human considerations, specially transferred the files of this case to Beijing for careful review. It has been six months now. Yesterday, the State Council meeting passed a special pardon for Zheng, so Zheng's restoration of freedom is only a matter of time. The reporter specially visited Zheng at the court detention center on the 10th. Zheng was detained in a special room No. 2 in the criminal detention center, located at the east end of the south building. The two-room building was still clean. There were four beds in the room, and Zheng occupied one of them. Zheng's servant and another prisoner each occupied one. The other bed was vacant. Zheng wore an old cotton robe covered with a gray gown with many oil stains. His face was red and black and he had enough blood and energy. After the reporter met Zheng, he asked for his opinions on the passage of the pardon case and the situation in prison. According to the conversation, Zhang Zongchang not only killed my father but also sent people everywhere to capture me and attempt to harm my family. My house was searched six times, so I lost my family and had no place to stand. I was forced to flee to Japan, and then to England and India. After I returned to China, I participated in the revolutionary work. After the Northern Expedition succeeded, I resigned and went home. Although my family has many members, I am the only strong man who can support the family. I have another younger brother who is still young, so the ambition of revenge is always in my heart. Last year, Zhang came to Jinan, so I was determined to kill him to avenge my hatred. However, I measured myself to be alone and weak. Even if I was successful, I would definitely not survive. Therefore, before assassinating Zhang, I knew that I would die. Fortunately, God pitied me and allowed me to survive. This proves that heavenly justice has not been destroyed. However, it is also due to the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. The results I have obtained are beyond my expectations. What else can I say? In the future, if you have any orders, I will go through fire and water and die ten thousand times. As for my life in prison, I have been specially treated by the gentlemen of the judicial community and have not felt any pain. Every day, in addition to reading and writing to pass the time, I also have friends visiting from time to time to chat and relieve my boredom. When asked what work he plans to do after his release, Zheng replied, "Before I assassinated Zhang, I was destined to die, and I never expected to have today. Now that I have escaped from death, I should repay the country with the rest of my life. I will do everything for the benefit of the public. Now Zhang Zongchang's son and his subordinates have mostly surrendered to the puppet state. If they gain power, then my whole family will inevitably be destroyed. Therefore, instead of having my whole family destroyed by the thieves, why not sacrifice the lives of my whole family to defend the country and resist the enemy during this time of hot war? Therefore, after I am released from prison, I am determined to go to the front to serve the country. Even if the environment does not allow it, I will also do my best to serve the country and kill the enemy." Also, during the Spring New Year this year, the couplet posted on the gate of Zheng's house read: "Jing Ke's smile can only pacify Lu, Goujian expects you to quickly destroy Wu," with the horizontal line reading: "Blessed by Heaven," which is also quite thought-provoking.</p>

<p>Gamblers Beat Up Judge and Refuse Arrest</p>
<p>The prosecutor of the Wuxian District Court, Lü Wenqin, received a secret report the day before yesterday that Chen Xilong had opened a gambling house on Nanhao Street outside the Lümen Gate, where a lot of money was being lost. Prosecutor Lü immediately led five policemen to search the house and found eight gamblers. However, Deng Xiaoheshang and others beat up the bailiffs and the prosecutor and stole the arrested gamblers with handcuffs.

<p>This county's detention center transferred 50 prisoners from the Third Suzhou Prison on February 1 of this year and detained them in the center. Disturbances occurred several times, but the prison officer Liu Weilin prevented them with strict precautions and failed. Yesterday afternoon (the 12th), the prisoners rushed out of the cage door in a riot, abandoned their shackles and beat people. Fortunately, the guards saw the fierce situation and immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to assist.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Guerrilla Mutiny Suppressed</p>
<p>After a part of the Jiangsu Maritime Guerrilla Brigade mutinied in Lüsi Town, Nantong County, at the beginning of last month, Han Deqin, the director of the Provincial Security Department, immediately reported to the chief of the First Security Regiment stationed in Tong, Zhu Mian, and ordered them to send troops to cooperate with the local police to suppress the mutiny. However, the mutineers had already looted ships and fled to the sea. Fortunately, the unmutinied part was dealt with quickly and followed closely, sinking two mutiny ships and killing or wounding countless people. The remnants fled north in a panic, and the coastal areas were slightly disturbed. Afterwards, Han also coordinated the suppression and appeasement measures, telegraphed Regiment Commander Zhu to cooperate with the four counties of Tong, Ru, Qi, and Hai to do their best to prevent them from returning, and ordered guerrilla captain Shen Fengshan to make amends for his crimes and seize the opportunity to suppress and appease. He sent a separate telegram to the seven counties of Dong, Yan, Fu, Lian, Guan, Hai, and Gan, selecting capable police and to distribute them to the coastal ports to block them. He dispatched Zhang Xianwen, the head of the Fourth District of the Maritime Public Security, and Li Zhenji, the captain of the Huaihai Special Task Force, to increase the number of patrol ships to patrol constantly. The mutineers had nowhere to escape and were finally disarmed in Xugou, Haishu, at the end of last month, and 38 rifles were seized. The Security Department has sent personnel to take delivery of them. Recently, on the 2nd and 3rd of this month, they again fled to the land in Chaos River (i.e., Linhongkou) and Batan in Funing. By this point, they had all been disarmed, and 91 rifles had been seized. It is now heard that the provincial government has telegraphed Fu, Lian, and Guan counties to quickly send all the captured criminals and rifles to the First Security Regiment for a report to the province for verification.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Chief of the Third District Accused of Being Dismissed</p>
<p>Since Xu Guangyu, the chief of Wangjiangjing (i.e., the Third District) in Jiaxing, took office, he has often delayed the work that should be done. Recently, he has even committed adultery with a married woman surnamed Chen and left his post without permission. The local people have been complaining. The citizens of the district have presented a complaint to the Civil Affairs Department about the illegal activities of the district chief. The Civil Affairs Department ordered the county to secretly investigate and found it to be true. It was determined that a strong wife should file a complaint, and the citizens have no right to sue. However, the district chief's actions were improper and did not win the hearts of the people. He should be dismissed immediately. The position of the district chief will be filled by Wang Jin. The Department has ordered the county to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Coastal Banditry Has Not Ended</p>
<p>The Lvsi and Fengcha areas along the coast of Jiangbei are well-known fish-producing areas. Recently, large numbers of sea bandits from Haizhou have been drifting in the ocean and extorting flag fees from fishing boats. If they are not satisfied, they will kidnap people and seize ships. Sometimes, the sea bandits even land to burn, rob, and kidnap for ransom, causing great harm. Each field has jointly compiled a patrol team for the fishery and reorganized the old fishery teams to defend against bandits.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Two Robberies Occur in the City</p>
<p>Robberies occur repeatedly in the urban and rural areas of this county, and very few are solved. Now, the home of Yu Jizhi outside the North Gate of this county was again robbed by many thieves, who broke down the door and searched for clothes, silver ornaments, and other items. Li Qumin, a native of Luzhou, lived in the Yunggong office. Before dawn on the 12th, thieves broke into the house and robbed him of more than 3,000 yuan. He reported to the Second Police Station in charge of the area that a former cook, Tang Kaiding, had colluded with officials from the Drug Inspection Office to come to investigate opium several days ago, which seemed suspicious. The station has joined forces with the Public Security Investigation Team to arrest Tang Kaiding and suspects Xu Hanzhang, Zhu Renjie, and Zhang Licai outside the West Gate. After questioning, they were transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>

In addition to 10,000 pairs of shoes, flour, gasoline, and automobiles sent to Sun Dianying's troops, who are far away, it is specially heard Lan Wen (1) Mr. Mu Xiangyue and Mr. Huang Yanpei Xunjian Zhidian Jingxi is the duty of the military to defend the land and resist aggression, and he is ashamed to be praised. It is only because Chengde and Lingyuan are not守 that the main force of the enemy army is advancing towards Chixi. My Liu brigade is fighting with the enemy in the east of Weichang for several days and nights. The Dadiao in the northwest of Chifeng has been handed over to commander Ding Brigade today at 2:00 pm. Last night at 12:00, the lieutenant of my Liu brigade joined forces and was a hundred times more courageous. He sneaked into the enemy's rear in the east of Weichang. The battalion commander was killed in battle, and the deputy battalion commander Wang Xiping captured two enemy armored vehicles, four machine guns, and more than 30 long and short guns. More than 100 enemies were killed. One officer and one soldier of our army were killed and fourteen soldiers were injured. Liu Brigade Commander 率队伍 At dawn, the enemy retreated slightly. I, Sun Dianying, Yu Deng, etc. stated Zhu Qinglan 兀 (1) Local associations, national salvation groups, and newspapers are informed that, according to Song Zheyuan's representative, the enemy has been using infantry, artillery, 空, and armored vehicles to launch a large-scale attack on the position of my Song 部 at Xifengkou for several consecutive days. Song ordered the broadsword team to lie down in the trenches and not move. The rear team pretended to retreat, and at the same time transferred the two brigades of Tong and Zhao to copy the enemy's flanks on the left and right. The enemy did not察 and penetrated deeply. The broadsword team suddenly rose up and slashed bravely forward. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the two sides surrounded each other layer by layer. At this time, aircraft and artillery were ineffective, and my soldiers were determined to die. The enemy army initially resisted tenaciously in hand-to-hand combat. After being砍 and killed more than half, they were frightened and begged for mercy. The enemy is now being缴械. After this bloody battle at Xifengkou, the enemy was almost wiped out. Please provide replenishment, assistance, and treatment for the casualties. In addition to sending a large amount of慰劳口 to replenish ammunition and properly安置 the wounded soldiers, I, Zhu Qinglan, Yuan.</p>
<h3>Wu Chao-shu Advocates Resistance to the End</h3>
<p>The Secret Agreement Between Japan and the Puppet Regime Is Confirmed</p>
<p>Avoiding Japanese Deception Is the Only Way Out</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Mr. Wu Chao-shu came to Beijing to attend the memorial service for the late Premier on February 12th and paid respects at his mausoleum on Zijin Mountain. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Wu at his private residence this morning. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<h3>Secret Agreement Between Japan and the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, the secret agreement between Japan and the puppet regime, as reported in Western newspapers, is indeed a reality. Someone in Beijing said that the matter of the agreement between Japan and the puppet regime has been under negotiation for a long time. This person saw at the office of an important figure in the puppet state a memorandum from Japan to the puppet state, instigating Pu Yi to change his title and proclaim himself emperor, establishing a "Federal Empire of China." The military expenses for the Yangtze River region and the two Guangdong provinces are all included in the budget. 5 million is listed for Hebei and 10 million for Shandong. It can be seen that Japan's ambitions are boundless. After occupying Rehe, crossing the river, crossing the Huai River, and crossing the Yangtze River to annex all of China is all part of their conspiracy.</p>
<h3>Fallacies Deceive People</h3>
<p>Recalling when the Japanese army entered Shenyang and attacked Jinzhou, they declared that they would "stop at Shanhaiguan." After our Jinzhou was captured, Japan then declared that Rehe was within their sphere of influence. Now, the defending troops have collapsed without a fight, and the Japanese army has reached the Great Wall. They are again advocating peace and setting up neutral zones to weaken our fighting spirit and relax our people's minds. They can then enter our territory at any time. Their deceitful schemes are actually putting our Chinese people to death. People of the nation, you must wake up! When we read the history of the Warring States period and see how the rulers of various states were manipulated by persuaders, we cannot help but laugh. Then, five hundred or a thousand years later, won't our descendants laugh at us for being deceived by the Japanese?</p>
<h3>Resistance to the End</h3>
<p>Gubeikou, which connects Chengde and reaches the imperial hunting grounds, is a place that we must fight for. We must defend it to the death. I have repeatedly said that resistance to the end is the only way out for our Chinese nation. As for the League of Nations Advisory Committee, Russia has already replied that it will not participate, while the United States has not yet replied. It is likely that the United States is preoccupied with its domestic economic crisis and has no time for this matter. Therefore, there is no date set for the meeting of the Advisory Committee. In short, if the League of Nations can effectively restrain Japan, it would be a good thing. If it is intimidated by Japan's arrogance and accomplishes nothing, we can only do our best to resist.</p>
<h3>Wireless Engineering Students to England</h3>
<p>Six Months of Internship at Marconi Headquarters</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Report states that Mr. Li Cha, the representative of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company in China, hosted a dinner at the Capital Hotel yesterday (the 13th) for four Chinese engineering students, Mr. Hu, Mr. Liang, Mr. Luo, and Mr. Sun. Mr. Hu and the others will depart today (the 14th) on the Conte Verde for Chelmsford, England, to intern at the Marconi Wireless Telegraph headquarters for six months. Mr. Li Cha said in his speech that he was pleased that there will soon be the latest high-speed wireless telegraph communication between China and England. The station will be built between Zhenru and Liuhe, and its steel masts will arrive within a month. It is expected that the entire station will be completed by the end of the year. The Ministry of Communications is sending four engineers to England for internship to study the advanced technology and knowledge of wireless equipment installation, so that they can train Chinese people in wireless engineering knowledge after returning to the country.</p>
<h3>The Chi-Bo (Chicago Expo) Products Association Yesterday Hosted the Press</h3>
<p>A Further Two-Week Exhibition of Products Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>On the Second Floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that after the Executive Yuan decided to stop China's participation in the Chicago Exposition, the Nanjing Preparatory Committee was dissolved and the collected exhibits were returned. The Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, He Bingxian, even went to Beijing to report on the matter. However, because the merchants had spent a long time preparing and collecting the exhibits and had sacrificed a great deal of labor, money, and effort, they were unwilling to stop halfway and miss this good opportunity to promote domestic goods. They then organized the Products Association to participate automatically under the guidance of the government and have already obtained government approval. Currently, they are actively preparing to make the exhibition even more perfect. It has been decided that from the 16th of this month, the exhibits will be displayed for two weeks on the second floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road for people to visit and to solicit criticism and suggestions. The Association hosted the press yesterday afternoon to report on the recent preparations. The details are described below:</p>
<h3>Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Products Association for participation in the Chicago Exposition has been actively preparing in order to be ready to participate. According to Mr. Wu Guangzhi, a director of the Association, most of the merchants with products for exhibition have already joined or have sent letters requesting the Association to transport their exhibits to the United States for display. Therefore, the exhibits returned by the Preparatory Committee are being received and stored by the Association for packing and shipping to the United States. As for the charts, tables, and specimens made by the government, the Association is also willing to bring them for display and has sent a letter to the government, but has not yet received a reply. However, according to Mr. Wu, he expects that the request will be granted. The most important issue now is the construction of the exhibition hall. The Association previously requested Mr. Anlesi, the Commercial Counselor of the United States, to ask the U.S. government to reserve the site for the Chinese pavilion. After further negotiations by the Association, the request has been approved. The blueprint for the approximately 10,000 square foot building has also been drafted in the style of a Chinese palace, with construction costs of over 10,000 U.S. dollars. It can be completed in four weeks. However, because the U.S. Counselor has not yet accepted the Association's construction costs, construction has yet to begin. Nevertheless, it will definitely be completed before the opening date. The products will be displayed in Shanghai for two weeks and then shipped to the United States at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Two-Week Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Association has obtained the assistance of the</p>
<p>China National Products Company in Shanghai and will display all of the exhibits</p>
<p>on the south side of the second floor of the Continental Emporium</p>
<p>for two weeks, inviting everyone to visit and offer guidance and criticism. According to Mr. Zhou Guanhong, the managing director of the Association, the exhibition will open on the 16th of this month and will last for two weeks, closing at the end of the month. The exhibits include porcelain, ramie cloth, and tea from Jiangxi; lacquerware, wood carvings, and bamboo carvings from Fujian and Yangzhou/Nanjing; porcelain and antiques from Beiping; silk from the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory; educational equipment from the Commercial Press, the China Book Company, and the Scientific Instrument Museum; and cosmetics from the Family Industry Association. All of the above products are available for purchase. As for those to be transported to the United States for display, the Association will select the special and superior export products based on the standards reviewed by the Preparatory Committee. Admission tickets to the exhibition are priced at two jiao per person and have already been printed and are now on sale.</p>
<h3>Hosting the Press</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the China National Products Company and the Products Association hosted the press at the Zhengyi Society Club on Nanjing Road. Mr. Li Gengnian, the deputy manager of the National Products Company, and Mr. Zhou Guanhong, the managing director of the Products Association, reported, stating that the promotion of national products has been advocated for a long time, but the market is still flooded with foreign goods from all over the country. Therefore, assistance and cooperation from all sectors are still needed. This year has been designated as the "Year of National Products," and more efforts must be made to promote them overseas to expand the market. The government's decision to stop participating in the Chicago Exposition was out of necessity. However, since the preparations began, officials and merchants from all provinces and cities have worked hard to solicit exhibits, which has cost a great deal of effort and money. It would be a great pity to stop halfway. Therefore, the product producers have automatically organized and planned to participate. However, the task is heavy and the road is long, and it is hoped that all sectors will not hesitate to provide practical guidance.</p>
<h3>The Factory Inspection Association Issues a Declaration on the Right to Inspect Factories in the Special Zone</h3>
<p>Hosted the Press Yesterday, Gathering Industrial and Commercial Sectors Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>Reporting on Progress and Seeking Concrete Solutions Through Consultation</p>
<p>The Chinese Factory Inspection Association, in response to the infringement of the right to inspect factories in the Shanghai Special Zone by the authorities there, held a reception for the press at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Huaan Building on Jing'an Temple Road, attended by more than twenty reporters from various newspapers. It has also been decided to convene representatives from various industrial and commercial associations at 2:00 PM today and representatives from various labor unions at 2:00 PM tomorrow to discuss solutions. The address will temporarily be at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reporting on Progress: Mr. Tian Heqing reported that after the government promulgated the Factory Law and the Factory Inspection Law, the Ministry of Industry immediately established a training institute for factory inspectors, and the graduates of the institute were responsible for factory inspections. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the competent authority in Shanghai, established a division to carry out the initial factory inspections. The initial factory inspections were underway when the Shanghai War of 1932 occurred and they were suspended. They officially began on September 1st of last year. The Chinese Factory Inspection Association is an organization of factory inspectors. The initial implementation of inspections has now been completed, but although the Shanghai Municipal Government has repeatedly consulted with the authorities in the Special Zone regarding inspections there, the Special Zone authorities outwardly expressed their approval but secretly obstructed and attempted to seize our inspection rights. The Association, considering that the matter concerns national sovereignty and the interests of industry and commerce, is determined to fight for it and will consult with the industrial and commercial sectors to find concrete solutions. The Association has specially hosted the press to seek assistance in opinion in order to safeguard national rights. The Association has also issued a declaration, but the details were not reported due to time constraints.</p>
<p>Land Regulations: The Association's declaration stated that the authorities in the Shanghai Special Zone are recklessly attempting to seize the authority to inspect factories, which is obviously illegal and exceeds their authority. This matter is of great importance to the interests of all parties and to national sovereignty. The Association, feeling a sense of crisis, humbly presents its observations to the people of the country. Upon examination, the Chinese authorities participated in the establishment of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. However, the other side unilaterally revised the Land Regulations in 1869 and 1898 without the participation or recognition of the Chinese government. Therefore, the legal validity of the regulations is questionable. For the sake of argument, even considering the Land Regulations, which were not participated in or recognized by China but are regarded by the other side as the organizational law of the public concession, the powers of the Municipal Council are clearly stated in the relevant articles, and it cannot go beyond the matters listed in those articles. Regarding the management of the conditions of factories or labor, whether viewed in terms of the wording or the meaning of the regulations, the authorities in the Special Zone have no reason to interfere. How can they recklessly attempt to interfere? This is the first point.</p>
<p>Legal Experts Recognized: In June 1923, a commission was established to investigate child labor in the Public Concession. At that time, Mr. Radde (transliteration), the legal advisor to the Municipal Council, stated that the Municipal Council had no legal basis to formulate child labor regulations and force taxpayers to comply with them. Therefore, the child labor regulations proposed by the commission were shelved. In 1930, Judge Feitang came to Shanghai to investigate the general conditions of the Public Concession. Volume 2 of his report stated that industry in the Concession and its adjacent areas had developed rapidly in the past thirty years, and the population had doubled. In this rapidly changing situation, the Municipal Council had no legislative power to increase its powers, so administrative work suffered difficulties. For example, the management of labor conditions was one such area. There were many important matters that the municipal government could exercise jurisdiction over within its jurisdiction, but the Municipal Council had no power to deal with them in the Concession. The Municipal Council's inability to act on these matters, especially the management of schools and labor conditions, has naturally aroused criticism and attempts by Chinese officials to exercise jurisdiction within the Concession (see page 213 of Volume 2 of the English report). Even legal experts such as Radde and Feitang, who were in the position of the Concession authorities, recognized that the Concession authorities had no power to manage labor conditions. This is a solid legal case that cannot be overturned even if one wants to protect it. This is the second point.</p>
<p>British Minister's Reply: On June 12, 1863, some foreigners in Shanghai sent a letter to Sir Frederick Bruce, the British Minister in Beijing, requesting that the power of Chinese local officials in the Concession be restricted. On August 6 of the same year, Mr. Bruce replied that Chinese people who were not employed by foreigners should be completely subject to the rule of Chinese officials and have the same status as those living in the Chinese area. From the historical evolution of the Concession, it can also be seen that the authorities in the Special Zone are attempting to usurp the right to inspect factories. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Ambition and Seizure: The authorities in the Special Zone have repeatedly stated that they do not recognize the power of the Chinese government in the Special Zone. This statement is extremely absurd. When and under what treaty did the Chinese government completely abandon its sovereignty in the Concession? The state has supreme, unique, and indivisible sovereignty over the people residing within its territory. This is the highest principle that constitutes an independent state. Now, the territorial rights of the Special Zone still belong to our country, and the people residing in the Special Zone have the same obligation to obey the will of the state and abide by the laws of the state as the people residing outside the Special Zone. The authorities in the Special Zone must not extend their giant hand and push the people in the Special Zone outside the scope of state power. The authorities in the Special Zone are well aware of these legal principles, but because their ambition is difficult to quell, they have painstakingly sought to revise Rule 34 of the Land Regulations' Appendix. This rule stipulates that any enterprise established in the Public Concession must obtain a license from the Municipal Council in advance and be subject to its constraints. The method of this revision is to add the item "factories" to the various enterprises listed in the appendix. The authorities intend to force factories to obtain licenses from the Municipal Council under the pretext that the amendment to the appendix was passed by the foreign taxpayers' meeting on April 19 of this year, so that they can achieve their goal of seizing power. However, gathering a few foreigners together and deliberating all day long to make a decision and turn it into a law in an attempt to control our Chinese taxpayers will only be in vain. This kind of unilateral action cannot be recognized by our Chinese taxpayers and will only lead to wasted effort.</p>
<p>Preventing Trouble Before it Happens: From the perspective of the interests of all parties, if the factory inspection affairs in Shanghai are divided among several agencies, the power will be inconsistent and the policies will be confusing. In addition to complying with the national labor laws, factories will also be subject to the illegal constraints of the Municipal Council, which will lead to endless disputes in the future. Moreover, the authorities in the Special Zone are aiming at the general powers of managing factories and labor, not just the issue of factory inspection. If we compare the powers that the Municipal Council should have according to the Yangjingbang Land Regulations with the current powers of the Municipal Council, we can infer that over the years, the authorities have deliberately expanded their own powers. After a long time, they treat it as an established fact, and the Chinese people are silent and dare not argue, allowing this deformed organization to grow larger and larger. If this matter of factory inspection is allowed to proceed, then after they have established the foundation of this political power, they will surely follow their old tricks and gradually expand their power. If this continues, they will eventually seize all the labor administration and factory management rights in the Concession. In recent years, the Chinese people have been striving to recover the lost sovereignty. How can we allow ourselves to repeat the same mistake and easily give up the sovereignty that has not been lost? People from all walks of life may not have paid attention to the factory inspection issue in the Special Zone because of the country's many difficulties, but if we are careless today and plant this evil seed, the evil consequences in the future will be unimaginable. Our government authorities have a duty to argue on the basis of reason, and if they show any concern, people from all walks of life should also rise up and work together to resist and urge the authorities in the Special Zone to reflect. The Association is dedicated to improving the factory inspection business and has a more sensitive understanding of the situation. I dare to share my humble opinion with the people of the country, hoping that you will all take note of it.</p>
<p>Letters to Various Organizations: The Chinese Factory Inspection Association sent letters to various organizations, such as the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation, yesterday, stating that the Special Zone authorities have been disregarding our national sovereignty in Shanghai for a long time, and have recently intensified their efforts to obstruct inspections. They are planning to amend Rule 34 of the Land Regulations' Appendix at a special meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 19 of this year, so as to force factories to obtain licenses from the Municipal Council and impose various illegal constraints. It has been decided that a tea reception will be held at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month to invite people from the industrial sector in Shanghai to discuss and find solutions together. This matter concerns national sovereignty and the interests of the industrial sector itself. It is hoped that your association will send one representative to attend on time.</p>
<h3>Public Exhibition of Photography Works from the Chicago Expo</h3>
<p>Will be Sold Piece by Piece to Donate to the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The China Travel Service collected an unusually successful number of Chinese photography works for the Chicago Expo Preparatory Committee. After the government ordered the Preparatory Committee to stop participating because of the country's difficulties, the company retrieved all of the exhibits and held a public exhibition. Mr. Chen Xiangtao, the president of the company, recently agreed with the photography exhibitors to sell the photographs at a marked price to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Public Exhibition: The company is now displaying all of the photographs at the library on the roof of the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road. Visitors can enter through the main entrance of the Guangzhao Public Association and take the elevator directly. More than a thousand people have already visited to appreciate the works. The beautiful works displayed on all four walls have been praised by many visitors as opening a new era of Chinese photography exhibitions.</p>
<p>Sale at Marked Price: The company previously sent a letter to all of the exhibitors proposing to sell the exhibits at a marked price and donate the proceeds to the Northeast Volunteer Army. Over the past few days, they have received replies expressing their support. The company has decided to mark the price of each item today and will begin selling them publicly tomorrow.</p>
<p>Judging Method: At the beginning of the collection of exhibits, the company announced the judging and awarding of prizes to the exhibitors. The judging will still be carried out as originally planned. The company's Photography Collection Committee has appointed Ye Yufu, Fu Bingchang, Jiang Xiaocang, Lang Jingshan, Chen Wanli, Song Chunfang, and Lu Pinqin as the judging committee. Once the judging is completed, the exhibitors will be notified by letter and the results will be published in the newspapers. It has been decided that any judging committee member who has submitted an exhibit will not be eligible to receive the company's prizes.</p>
<h3>The Two-Roads Management Bureau Actively Reorganizing Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>Will convene various sectors to study freight rates</p>
<p>The Relocation of the Temporary Station to Cease</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that since Mr. Huang Boqiao took office as the director of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Management Bureau, he has been striving to reorganize it. The reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Mo Heng, the director of the General Affairs Department, yesterday to learn about the debt reform situation of the Railway Bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Debt Reorganization</h3>
<p>The two railways suffered heavy losses in the January 28th Shanghai War and have accumulated foreign debt of more than 14 million yuan to the Central Company. Since Mr. Huang Boqiao aims to address the issue at its core, he decided to solve the foreign debt problem. He recently repaid about 250,000 yuan to the China-England Company for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line and about 70,000 yuan for the Shanghai-Nanjing line's vehicle debt. As for the reported debt of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway reaching 50 million yuan, it has been decided to establish a debt reorganization committee to start the reorganization, and there is no such thing as the reported amount.</p>
<h3>Fare Study</h3>
<p>Recently, the freight volume on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways has slightly decreased compared to before. It is currently studying whether there is a relationship between the decrease in freight volume and the increase in freight rates, and will convene various commercial organizations to discuss concrete solutions to be submitted to the Ministry for adoption. But the freight should decide policies, such as preferential treatment for the transportation of domestic goods, in order to reform fares.</p>
<h3>Temporary Station</h3>
<p>Since the North Station was destroyed in the Shanghai War, an order was received from the Ministry of Railways to build a temporary station at Song Park Road in Zhabei. The old site of the North Station was put up for sale. Now, the temporary station at Song Park Road has begun to break ground and is about to be built. Because of the serious situation and financial difficulties, the Ministry has ordered to stop the building process. It ordered the engineering office to stop the building. The stations will temporarily remain as they are. It is now planned to rebuild the destroyed offices of the North Station.</p>
<h3>Relocation Begins</h3>
<p>Since the decision was made to relocate the Management Bureau on Laobazilu to the Riverside Mansion on North Henan Road, it has now been decided that the relocation will begin tomorrow. The Engineering Office and the General Affairs Department will be relocated first. The Mechanical Engineering Office will be relocated starting from the 18th, and the Accounting Office and the Materials Office will also be relocated before the end of this month. It was originally planned to relocate the Traffic Department to the old site on Laobazilu, but now, in order to facilitate the scheduling of vehicles, it may be necessary to change the relocation plans due to the progress of the temporary station.</p>
<h3>Third-Class Round-Trip</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways regards third-class passenger transport as the main income of the railway.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it ordered all railway bureaus across the country to sell third-class round-trip sightseeing tickets from May 1st. The command was to prepare immediately. The brief measures are as follows: (1) The fare is calculated at 85% of twice the ordinary third-class one-way fare. (2) The ticket has a signature style for the ticket holder. All ticket holders must sign before boarding, and the ticket holder must sign again for verification during the ticket inspection. If it does not match the signature style before boarding, the ticket should be supplemented in accordance with the regulations. (3) The tourist destinations, ticket issuing stations, time of sale, and validity period are all handled in the same way as the first and second class. (4) All ticket issuing agencies are allowed to sell a third-class round-trip sightseeing ticket for each passenger who purchases first and second class round-trip sightseeing tickets, and may not sell ordinary third-class round-trip sightseeing tickets alone.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Board of Directors Will Discuss the Waterworks Case Again</h3>
<p>Submitted to Today's Regular Meeting</p>

<h3>The City is Full of Air Defense Sentiment</h3>
<p>Children Launch a Fundraising Rescue Team</p>
<p>The Automobile Industry Generously Donates</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai City Recruiting Team of the China Aviation Association on the 1st of this month, people from all walks of life have donated to purchase airplanes as the only urgent task to save the country. This is because of the Shanghai Incident of January 28th last year and the recent Rehe Incident. The enemy planes wantonly bombed and there were no sound air force to resist. Not only was the military affected, but the people also suffered innocent deaths. In just over ten days, the results have been extraordinary. The news received yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Standing Board Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Standing Board Meeting of the China Aviation Association has been scheduled for 2:00 PM this Thursday. According to Mr. Lin Kanghou, the Standing Director of the Association, the Central News Agency reporter stated that in addition to discussing routine affairs, the Standing Board Meeting must also pass the organizational regulations and operating rules of the Fund Management Committee, so that the first meeting of the Fund Management Committee, which will be held at 4:00 PM on the same day, will have something to follow. The relevant regulations have been drafted by Mr. Lin Wojian, the Secretary-General of the Association, and distributed to the Standing Directors and Committee members for prior study to facilitate discussion.</p>
<h3>Children Initiate Fundraising to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>Previously, the letter from Wang Meifen, a child in this city, to the mayor, suggesting a reduction in membership fees for children joining the Aviation Association, to enable all children in the city to join the association, and the reply from the Aviation Association, were published in various newspapers. Now, it is learned that eleven children, including Tang Mingyue, have formed a "Children's Voluntary Fundraising to Save the Nation Team," drafted regulations, and issued a declaration, sending a letter to the mayor for instructions. The mayor praised their patriotism and forwarded the letter to Lin Wojiang, the secretary-general of the Aviation Association, for review and action, and replied with commendation. The original letter and declaration from the children to the mayor are compiled below:</p>
<p>(Original Letter) Dear Mayor, we were so happy to receive your reply! Especially because we want to intensify our work on aviation to save the nation. Therefore, we received the charter of the Chinese Aviation Association yesterday. It is right that we should follow the mayor's instructions. However, we still have a small opinion that requires the mayor's permission and assistance. Our intention is to follow the Aviation Association's charter. It only costs two dollars a year for us children to join as ordinary members, and only fifty dollars a year for our school to join as a group member. However, our ambition is to donate a round number of 100,000 or 200,000 dollars. Our organization, of course, does not violate the Aviation Association's charter. However, we have another group that makes my work more efficient. On the one hand, we would like the gentlemen of the Aviation Association to give us a lot of guidance. We plan to deposit the money we raise in a designated bank and send it to the Aviation Association for legal safekeeping. We will not use a penny of the team's expenses, all of which will be borne by ourselves or donated by our parents. Dear Mayor, if we do this, we won't have any differences with the unified organization, will we? Now, we respectfully enclose the brief rules and declaration for your review and approval, and request your permission to put us on file. We wish our dear Mayor longevity! Attached is a copy of the declaration and brief rules.</p>
<p>Founders of the Children's Voluntary Fundraising to Save the Nation Team: Tang Mingyue, Zhang Pengming, Min Buhuan, Gu Zhihan, Zhao Quanhui, Wang Haichao, Sun Genxiang, Min Luozheng, Min Bude, Min Buke, Min Buzhen.</p>
<p>(Declaration) Declaration of the Children's Voluntary Fundraising to Save the Nation Team: We are children. Why do we want to organize a voluntary fundraising to save the nation team? How the three northeastern provinces were seized by the Japanese and how Rehe recently fell were all due to the oppression of enemy aircraft. Therefore, we must rise up to raise funds to complete the Shanghai Children's Aircraft. We have no sophisticated organization, nor any strange ideas, because we are pure children. We only know how to love our country. Now our national salvation team has already started working. We ask our dear uncles, aunts, mothers, and sisters-in-law to donate more. On the one hand, we ask our brothers, sisters, and children to join our group. All the expenses of our team are borne by ourselves or donated by our parents. We will not use a penny of the donations. On the one hand, we will deposit the donations in the Shanghai Bank and send them to the Aviation Association for legal safekeeping to fulfill our aspirations. Children, come and join our group quickly! Compatriots, donate more! March of the 22nd year [of the Republic].</p>

<p>(Reply Letter) Dear children, this afternoon, I received the letter forwarded by the mayor. Your enthusiasm in advocating children's voluntary fundraising to save the nation has made me feel extraordinarily excited after reading the letter. Children, we older people often feel very sorry for you. Our motherland has reached a point where it is precarious and may not be able to last for long. This is because we were unwilling to struggle and work hard in our childhood, and we were unable to save our motherland from danger, so we created this unbearable situation that will soon be left to you children. Regarding the tragic history of the subjugation of Goryeo [Korea] and what followed, your wise parents and teachers must have often told you about it. The suffering of being a slave to a fallen country is not only the lack of other freedoms, but even the desire to voluntarily raise funds to save the nation is impossible. Children, please never forget that China is yours! You bear a great mission for the future rise and fall, strength and weakness of China. If China unfortunately encounters a tragic demise, the days you spend as slaves to a fallen country will be even longer than ours. I hope you will keep this in mind and work doubly hard. As for your request for this association to send someone to guide your work, we believe that it is our inescapable responsibility. Please reply quickly to arrange a date, and we will send someone to contact you. Wishing you all the best!</p>
<p>Your friend, Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association.</p>

<h3>Sub-teams Strive to Proceed</h3>
<p>Since the captain of the Second, Fifth, and Sixth Detachments of the Chinese Aviation Association Shanghai City Solicitation Team, Mr. Wang Lianfang, has been carrying out the solicitation of aviation donations, he has hired Jiang Fuchen, Hu Huiyuan, Sun Wenyi, Hong Xinfu, Yuan Quanhe, Shao Liansan, Cen Defa, Wang Caixiang, Le Fucheng, Chen Fengming, Huang Hongjun, Hu Lifu, Wang Zhengfu, Tu Runcai, Wang Hexing, Hou Guohua, Wang Yuqing, Lin Zhenren, Cheng Yangtian, Wang Hanli, Xia Xiaoqing, Shi Zongtang, etc. as team members. Although the time has not been long, the results have been remarkable. Jiang Fuchen, Hu Huiyuan, Sun Wenyi, and Hong Xinfu are the most outstanding. As the deadline for the first solicitation is approaching, Mr. Wang sent letters to the team members yesterday, urging them to report their results before the opening of the first solicitation on the tenth of this month, and to gather and report.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Donate Voluntarily</h3>

<h3>Artillery Fire Rages Outside the Pass, Japanese Goods Imported into Shanghai</h3>
<p>Over 200,000 pieces in two weeks</p>
<p>After the outbreak of hot war, the import of Japanese goods has increased more than last month, probably because Japanese merchants in various places fear that the war will expand or hinder sea transport, so they have successively shipped Japanese stocks to China in advance. From March 2 to today, within two weeks, the Japanese goods shipped to Shanghai were allocated by Japanese merchants in advance, totaling 250,000 pieces, transported in nine batches. There have been eight times of loading and transportation. Only one ship has not arrived yet. Among those that have been shipped are cloth, seafood, electrical materials, glass, and rubber products. Bleaching powder is also quite a lot, and there is also a large batch of Dongtang, with an average statistical value of about six or seven million yuan.</p>
<p>Three batches of imported Japanese post office ships, Rokko Maru, Aso Maru, and Mikasa Maru, etc., came from Yokohama, Osaka, Kobe, Japan, and arrived in Shanghai on the previous yesterday, etc., and were unloaded at the Huishan Japanese post offices' docks and warehouses. It has been found that Aso Maru loaded 15,360 pieces, Rokko Maru loaded 19,112 pieces, and Mikasa Maru loaded 20,566 pieces. The goods are fully equipped, with cotton, leather, metal, glass, seafood, and sugar, etc. There are also nearly 8,000 pieces of goods transshipped to the Yangtze River, which were also loaded at the same time, but it is reported that on the 20th, 21st, and 26th, there are three ships, Tsukuba Maru, Ikoma Maru, etc., carrying 60,000 pieces of cargo to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Changing Brand Names Yesterday, a gentleman who knew the transport of Japanese goods very well told a reporter that the arrival of goods in various places seems very strict on the surface recently, but the import of Japanese goods has increased several times more than before, and it has not been heard that anything has been detected. The method of unloading and repackaging Japanese goods is so skillful that Chinese people (except for unscrupulous merchants engaged in Japanese goods) cannot recognize them. There are now several companies in Shanghai specializing in changing brand names, changing boxes, and changing packaging. The cargo owner gives a certain commission and can turn them into non-Japanese goods. Nineteen out of ten Japanese goods that have recently arrived in Shanghai are sold after changing their brand names. Therefore, Japanese merchants in Shanghai resolutely oppose the import regulations announced by our country's customs that must indicate the original country name.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Fish Merchants Appeal</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Petition Delegation Receives Reporters</p>
<p>The Fuzhou fish merchants' petition delegation hosted dozens of reporters from various newspapers at the Zhimei Restaurant on Sima Road yesterday noon regarding the excessive taxes and levies on fisheries in the province. During the banquet, Cai Xunzhong, the representative of the delegation, stood up and reported the details as follows: "We are honored to have the presence of gentlemen from the Shanghai press today. The unfortunate incident of the Fuzhou fish merchants has resulted in a strike for a month, enduring pain and unable to appeal. We have specially sent Xunzhong and others as representatives to go to Nanjing and Shanghai to petition the central national government, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of the Interior, and to appeal to all circles in Shanghai. We have already requested assistance from the National Federation of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Now, I will briefly report the facts and details of the tragic incident: In the past, the fish tooth tax in Fuzhou was recognized by our merchants ourselves, and the quota was shared equally according to the number. There was no collection bureau. The quota was initially increased from 5,000 yuan to 39,000 yuan. Before the last term, Shi Jialin, the director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance, ordered an increase of 20%, and the pain of the fish merchants had reached its limit. After the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, the provincial government reorganized, and the newly appointed director of the Department of Finance, Fan Qiwu, was about to get off the bus when the tax dodger Chen Jichu ignored the suffering of the fish merchants and covered up the Department of Finance to increase the quota and set up a bureau to collect it. However, the dying fish industry could not bear this burden, and Chen Jichu led a team of more than 20 people armed with guns and live ammunition to the Zhongting Street fish market at 5:00 am on February 12. Taking advantage of the opening of the market, he first ordered the closure of the business, and then opened fire indiscriminately. The prosperous and lively street market at that time suddenly became a gloomy and terrifying battlefield. The salted fish mate Wang Zhiben was shot through both legs because he could not escape, and he is now awaiting death. He also ordered the team to injure more than a dozen other people with the butts of their guns, and more than 60 pieces of fresh fish worth more than 6,000 yuan were forcibly taken and sold. He dared to illegally detain Huang Chunlang, the accountant of Wanyuan, and has not yet released him. He acted recklessly, just like bandits. Our merchants do not want to have this phenomenon under the rule of our revolutionary government, and even less do we want to have this phenomenon under the rule of the 19th Route Army, which has the honor of resisting Japan. Moreover, our merchants have been on strike for a month, and the Shanghai newspapers have published news about it. Workers such as fishmongers, fish transporters, and porters have been affected, and the number of unemployed workers is no less than several thousand. If it is not resolved further, the lives of these thousands of people will be in danger. Xunzhong and others are specially representing to Shanghai and Beijing to appeal and petition for a final solution. I dare to ask the gentlemen of the press to uphold justice and give strong support. That would be very fortunate. There are still tears to tell the various circles, omitted."</p>

<h3>French Training Ship Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

Yesterday afternoon, the local French community flocked to the ship for sightseeing. A banquet will be held at the French Chamber of Commerce tomorrow night to welcome the instructors and officers of the ship. The ship, 6,600 tons, was launched in 1930 and is specially used for training naval officers. It currently has 26 instructors, 151 officers, and 500 soldiers and crew members. It departed from Brest, France, on October 5 last year for its first world voyage, passing through North Africa, Asia Minor, India, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, and Vietnam, before arriving in Shanghai via Hong Kong. It plans to stay in Shanghai for four days and then go to Nagasaki, Japan, where it will stay for three weeks before taking the route via Honolulu and San Francisco, passing through the Panama Canal and returning to France. The French have used the name of Jeanne d'Arc, a strange woman who retreated to England and recovered lost territory for France, to name their warships. This is now the fifth ship. The first ship was built in 1820, and the second ship was built in 1847 and fought in Chinese waters. On January 6, 1855, it followed Courbet to bombard the Taiping Army in Shanghai. The third ship was built in 1865, and the fourth ship was built in 1897. The fifth ship was built specifically for training officers.</p>
<h3>Huang Bingheng Left the Country Yesterday Morning</h3>

He left Shanghai at 8:00 am yesterday on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde. It is said that Huang will first go to Italy and then to Germany, England, and other countries. The date of his return to China has not yet been determined. The Shanghai General Association of the Chinese Aviation Association also heard the news and entrusted Huang to investigate the general situation of civil aviation in Europe and the West for reference. It is said that Huang's trip abroad was quite secret before his departure to avoid socializing with all parties, so the outside world knew very little about it. The reporter also learned from a friend after Huang left Shanghai.</p>

The method is limited to widely soliciting donations from Dangshou Xiaobao and various carpenters. The minimum amount for workers is six dimes, and there is no limit for Dangshou Xiaobao. Everyone donates according to their economic ability and enthusiasm. More than 100 people attended the meeting that day and unanimously agreed.

<h3>House Collapse on Huaide Road Injures People</h3>
<p>Many Men and Women Injured by Being Crushed</p>
<p>The houses on the original site of the Catholic Church behind Jishan Lane on Huaide Road in Hongkou were dilapidated, so the landlord asked craftsmen to demolish them. Because the wood was old and decayed, it collapsed yesterday at 11:00 am, leaning towards Jishan Lane and collapsing the garden wall of the lane. At that time, the residents of No. 72 of the lane, A Yang, Yu Cai, and her son Xingzi, the fruit vendor Zhou Qisheng, and the sugar vendor Chen Baozhi happened to be passing by and were crushed by the wall bricks. Fortunately, neighbors caught a glimpse of them and quickly called for help to drag them out of the bricks. At the same time, Zhou Zhenjiang and Xu Jingen, three small workers demolishing the house, also lost their footing and fell when the house collapsed, and were injured. The neighbors reported the capture and notified the fire brigade to send a car to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>A Tidal Bore in the Huangpu River Yesterday Morning Causes Disaster to a Japanese Ship</h3>
<p>Fengyang Maru is Rushed by the Tide</p>
<p>Many Barges Damaged by Collision</p>
<p>The tidal water at the Waitaibaidu Bridge is the most turbulent. It is common for ships leaving the port to cause accidents there. At 10:30 am yesterday, the Fengyang Maru, a Yangtze River ship of the Nisshin Company, sailed from the company's wharf in front of the Japanese Consulate. Just after leaving the wharf, it encountered a tidal bore. The ship could not stop, and the hull was washed by the tide and swept straight towards the Puxi shore on the left. Moreover, it was traveling very fast. From the Japanese Consulate to the east, there were dozens of ship wharves, export ships, private boats, cargo barges, sampans, and rowboats. The rapid advance of the Fengyang Maru caused great panic among the wharves, private boats, and cargo barges. At 10:50 am, the order in front of the Japanese post office wharf on the Huangpu River was in chaos. Cargo barges and private boats fled to the inner berths to prevent accidents. The Fengyang Maru flowed to the Gonghexing wharf, and the hull had crossed the fairway and was close to the west bank. The Gonghe, a Yangtze River ship of Jardine Matheson, was loading export goods, and there were six or seven large barges docked outside, which could not give way. As a result, one of the outermost large iron barges was violently hit by the Fengyang Maru, and the head of the barge was immediately destroyed. Four or five sampans and rowboats in front of and behind the barge were also vibrated and overturned. All the boatmen on the Huangpu River fell into the water. It was a great fortune that the Gonghe was not damaged.</p>
<p>After the boatmen of each boat fell into the water, fortunately, there were many private boats nearby, which helped to rescue them. As a result, the boatmen of each overturned boat were rescued. At that time, it was not known whether anyone had drowned after falling into the water. Later, the water patrol boat went to the scene of the accident to thoroughly investigate the situation of the boatmen who were victimized and reported the situation of the Japanese ship causing the disaster to the water patrol boat and the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>When the Japanese ship sailed out, the Fengyang Maru was causing trouble by crashing and flowing on the river. At that time, the Jiang'an ship of the China Merchants Bureau, fully loaded with passengers and cargo, was returning to Shanghai from Wuhan and was traveling to the Gonghexing wharf. The captain of the Jiang'an ship saw that the Japanese ship was not following the fairway and feared that a major accident would occur. He quickly drove through the outer side of the Japanese ship, and the Jiang'an just rubbed past the left side of the Fengyang Maru, and the collision occurred. It was a great fortune that the Jiang'an ship escaped this danger. After the accident, the Fengyang Maru continued to sail as usual out of Wusong and towards the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Yang Fusheng Stabs His Estranged Wife to Death</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Stab Wounds All Over Her Body</p>
<p>Ye Shen, a woman from Ningbo, was 19 years old. She lost her parents at a young age and was brought to Shanghai by her aunt to be raised. At the age of 16, she was betrothed to Yang Fusheng, a fellow villager. After marrying, she and Yang had disagreements within a year. She immediately fled back to her aunt's house. Since Shen left, Yang knew that she was hiding in her mother's home, but he never looked for her. He pretended to be deaf and dumb. Recently, Shen married Ye Qingsheng, a local, for the second time. Yang found out about it and came to question her. After the mediator mediated it three times, the result was that Yang was compensated for his losses of 240 yuan. From then on, they formally announced their separation. Shen and Ye rented a house in Huixianfang, No. 11, Fujia Street, under the jurisdiction of Section 2 of District 1 of the South City, and lived together. Unexpectedly, Yang still held resentment in his heart. At about 9:00 yesterday morning, he hid in the alley of Huixianfang with a sharp knife. Shen happened to get up early to carry a basket to the vegetable market to buy vegetables and was twisted by Yang and stabbed more than ten times all over her body with a knife. When passers-by heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, Yang had taken the opportunity to escape. The police reported to Section 2 of District 1 and sent Shen to Shanghai Hospital in a car. It is said that her injuries were serious.</p>
<h3>National Products Introduction Center of the China Production and Sales Association Commences Operations</h3>
<p>Introducing and promoting products, and handling raw materials on behalf of clients.</p>
<p>Establishing business rules and branch office regulations.</p>
<p>The National Products Introduction Center, organized by the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, has been actively preparing for practical work since its official opening on March 10th. A Shanghai newspaper reporter interviewed Mr. Xie Yunting, the manager of the center, yesterday. According to Mr. Xie, since the opening, the center has received enthusiastic visits from various parties. All internal facilities have been completed and operations have commenced. Recently, it was observed that individual and separate procurement of raw materials by various factories not only goes against economic principles but also wastes time. Therefore, it was decided to establish a raw material procurement department in addition to the introduction and promotion departments. A special commissioner has been appointed to handle procurement based on the principle of rationalization, to gain the benefits of large-scale purchases, and to reduce all unnecessary expenses to lower production costs and benefit future sales. Subsequently, factories requiring any raw materials, whether sourced domestically or abroad, can entrust the center to handle the procurement at any time. The center will serve with utmost sincerity to ensure satisfaction, Mr. Xie stated. After the interview, Mr. Xie provided the center's recently established business rules and plans for establishing branch offices in various locations, which are listed below:</p>
<h3>Business Rules</h3>
<p>(1) Factories whose products are introduced or promoted by the center must enter into a business contract with the center. (2) Member factories that have entered into a contract shall display various samples at the head office and at introduction centers in various locations. (3) The wholesale prices of various goods shall be detailed in a price list by the factory and submitted to the head office, which shall then notify the introduction centers in various locations. However, sales by the head office and introduction centers shall only be valid after the factory has confirmed them by letter or telegram, except for consigned goods. (4) In the event of stock shortages, price increases, or price decreases, the factory shall immediately notify the head office, which shall then notify the introduction centers in various locations to facilitate sales. (5) Introduction centers in various locations must enter into a contract with the head office in order to enjoy all the benefits of the head office. (6) Introduction centers in various locations shall consult with the head office regarding the sale or procurement of goods. (7) If introduction centers in various locations need to handle products from non-member factories, the center, in the spirit of promoting national products and production-sales cooperation, may handle them on their behalf. (8) The method of payment from the head office to the factories for goods procured shall be stipulated in the contract, or negotiated on a temporary basis if there is no contract. (9) The method of payment for the head office handling goods or sales for introduction centers in various locations shall also be stipulated in the contract. (10) The factory's responsibility for delivering goods shall only be discharged after the buyer at the destination has received the goods without error. If there are shortages, mold, breakage, short weight, or discrepancies between the goods and the samples or confirmed orders, any price reductions or deductions shall be the responsibility of the original factory. However, the introduction center has the right to inspect the goods upon receipt, and this procedure does not cancel the factory's aforementioned responsibility. (11) The method of payment when a buyer entrusts an introduction center in various locations to order goods shall be handled by the introduction center in that location. (12) Introduction centers in various locations shall be fully responsible to the head office for the buyer's fulfillment of the order contract. (13) Each location shall deposit a substantial guarantee with a designated bank to demonstrate prudence. (14) The buyer shall make payment to the designated bank based on the bill of lading and invoice, but shall inspect the goods completely within seven days from the date of receipt of the bill of lading. If there is any breakage or discrepancy, the buyer must negotiate in writing or by telegram within seven days, otherwise the center will not be responsible. (15) The introduction center has a showroom to facilitate buyers in matching goods. Factories that have entered into a contract are entitled to free display, but the size of the space shall be allocated by the head office.</p>

<h3>Rescue News Amidst the War Clouds in North China</h3>
<p>Since the loss of Chengde, the situation in North China has become increasingly critical. After the Shanghai Medical College acknowledged the seriousness of the situation, the morale of our army was greatly boosted by the personal expedition of Chairman Chiang. The fierceness of the battles at Xifengkou and Gubeikou is unprecedented, and the sacrifices on both sides are extremely heavy. Wounded soldiers arrive in Beiping in an endless stream, and various hospitals are insufficiently staffed. Therefore, Director of the Department of Health Liu Ruiheng and righteous army leader Zhu Ziqiao telegraphed Yan Fuqing, President of the National Shanghai Medical College, urgently requesting a response. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Yan convened all faculty and students late at night to give a lecture, explaining the great righteousness. All agreed to bravely dedicate themselves to service. Mr. Yan then convened a college affairs meeting yesterday to formally discuss the matter. It was immediately decided to organize a front-line rescue team and a reserve team. President Yan was elected as the leader, and Professors Liu Chongen, Wen Gan Chen, and Wu Zaidong were appointed as instructors to lead the entire medical team, with senior students as the main body. They plan to depart on the morning train on the 16th and will hold a grand farewell ceremony at the practice hospital this afternoon at 4:00 PM, attended by all faculty and staff.</p>
<p>Chinese Relief Association. The medical team of the Chinese Relief Association has resolved to depart after receiving a telegram from the military commission branch, and it has been approved to go north by train on the evening of the 28th of this month. All medical personnel will undergo further rigorous examinations to demonstrate solemnity. The shortage of funds has been requested from various public organizations in this city. However, there is still a shortage of medicines and supplies. If all sectors can generously donate medicines, cotton wool, gauze bandages, medicines, blankets, quilts, towels, and other necessary items, we would be especially grateful. The association received donations yesterday, including 50 yuan from Mr. Dong Sunzhuliang, 10 yuan from Zhang Shutang, and 5 yuan each from Liang Huai, Wang Yijun, and Li Yijun. Furthermore, a kind-hearted anonymous benefactor specially donated 50 teapots, 20 palm canopies, 50 bedpans, 20 water bottles, and 100 cans of milk, which were personally delivered to the association's office at the intersection of Rue Edouard and Tibet Road for transfer and use, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Rent Reduction Issue</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Dabai News Agency visited the Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw Association Special Zone Office yesterday to inquire about the content of the rickshaw pullers' representatives' request for rent reduction. According to the person in charge, there are tens of thousands of rickshaws in Shanghai registered with the Chinese, British, and French concessions. According to business practice, the rickshaw owners entrust the rickshaws to hirers (commonly known as "small bosses"), who then sublet them to the rickshaw pullers. However, the rickshaw pullers pay rent to the hirers every day, and the hirers must make a small profit to maintain their livelihood. Companies such as Feixing Company, due to the existence of large packages from branch companies and small packages from hirers, indirectly receive only 85 cents per rickshaw per day. This rent value has been in effect for five years and is worth less than 70 cents in the current market price. However, the current cost of necessary materials has increased significantly. Including the fees registered with the three concessions, the monthly expenses per rickshaw are at least 14 yuan. The salaries of the staff and workers managing the rickshaw affairs have not yet been included in the above statistics, so even if there is a surplus, it is minimal. Recently, people claiming to be rickshaw pullers' representatives, such as Meng Jin, are not genuine rickshaw pullers' representatives. Because rickshaw pullers have never had a group or union organization, it is difficult to have representatives produced, and the declarations made are also inconsistent with the facts.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Involving the Exchange of Hanchao for Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Sha Xiaoping's request for additional cash was unsuccessful</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance of the National Government issued long-term financial government bonds to relieve the Wuhan Central Bank and Bank of Communications from suspending the exchange of Hanchao banknotes, requiring holders of the Hanchao to exchange their banknotes for government bonds.  After the bondholders strongly opposed the exchange method, a lawsuit even occurred.  Subsequently, chambers of commerce and other organizations intervened and mediated, which resulted in changes to the original exchange method, that is, in addition to obtaining 100 yuan of long-term financial government bonds for every 100 yuan of Hanchao banknotes, an additional 30% in cash would be added to show consideration.  However, the scope of this exchange was limited to 7 million yuan.  It has long been fully exchanged, but Sha Xiaoping, a native of Nantong, who accumulated a large amount of Hanchao banknotes from the Bank of China in Hankou while doing business in Wuhan, brought them to Shanghai last year to exchange at the Bank of China in Shanghai.  The bank then followed the original exchange method, paying with the same amount of government bonds as the banknotes and adding 10% in government bonds.  However, Sha wanted to follow the precedent of the settlement after the previous bondholders filed a lawsuit and demanded an additional 20% in cash, and the two sides refused to compromise, which made it difficult to resolve for a long time. Now Sha has hired lawyer Peng Qixiu to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against Zhang Gongquan, the president of the Bank of China, accusing Zhang of embezzlement and breach of trust.  After Zhang learned of this, he hired lawyer Li Zuyu to appear in court and stated that the exchange of Hanchao was handled by Chen Wenbo of the Hanchao Management Office and had nothing to do with Zhang. The court then ordered the plaintiff to amend the complaint to name Chen Wenbo as the defendant in this case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian Wen continued the hearing and specially invited Shao Chaosheng, Zhu Xiyuan, and Ye Tingmei to appear in court as witnesses, stating that the Hanchao they held had previously been exchanged for full government bonds, plus 30% in cash, which was indeed the case. However, the defendant stated that the government bonds exchanged by the witnesses were within the 7 million yuan limit, so they were able to receive the preferential terms. The witnesses then stated that they had exchanged the bonds individually and had not participated in any exchange groups. Judge Qian stated that the case still required investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Fugitive Who Shot and Killed a Police Officer Found to Have Committed Multiple Crimes</h3>
<p>Firearms Seized in Zhabei</p>
<p>Zhou Yong'an, also known as Zhai Yong'an, from Qingjiang, gathered a gang last year to shoot and wound Sun Jiming, a police officer of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and kill Zhang Hanchen, a police officer, on Liyuan Road in the Chinese Concession. He also robbed Officer Sun of a Mauser pistol. On February 28th of this year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team apprehended Zhou and interrogated him regarding the location of the robbed pistol, which was hidden in Nanjing. The bureau then ordered four detectives to escort Zhou to the capital to investigate the whereabouts of the Mauser pistol. However, while at a hotel in Nanjing, Zhou took advantage of the detectives' inattention, escaped with the handcuffs, and managed to open the handcuffs and flee back to Shanghai. Although the Public Security Bureau launched a rigorous search, it was unsuccessful. Until the day before yesterday, Liu Junqing, a Chinese detective of the Laoza Gate Police Station, learned that he would have to go to Shenjiatan, Yangshupu on that day at noon. He and Chinese detective Li Shugui went to wait. After a while, Zhou arrived. Detective Liu and others then stepped forward and arrested him. Under questioning, it was learned that the Mauser pistol Zhou had robbed was not hidden in Nanjing, but in No. 80 Bailu Road, Zhabei. The pistol and four bullets were recovered. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Court I. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, stating that the defendant had committed multiple robbery cases in the Public Concession that have not yet been identified, and requested permission for an extension to continue the investigation. Detective Liu also submitted a report on the circumstances of the arrest. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report and ordered the case to be adjourned for one week.</p>
<h3>Chai Yanxu Accuses His Uncle of Embezzling Inheritance</h3>
<p>Chai Yanxu is the son of the late Huzhou wealthy merchant Chai Bingsheng and currently resides at No. 208 Manshi Road. He has recently hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yang Zhihao to file a complaint with the First Special District Court accusing his uncle, Pan Xiangsheng, of embezzling his inheritance. The reasons for his lawsuit are that Chai's mother, Ji, died in Shanghai in August of the ninth year of the Republic of China, leaving behind contracts, jewelry, gold, and pearls worth approximately 300,000 yuan, which were stored at home in a box. Subsequently, the defendant took advantage of the plaintiff's engagement and requested to open the box, claiming to be handling the engagement formalities. Afterwards, when he was urged to return the items, he claimed that the deceased had entrusted him to manage them and refused to hand them over. At that time, the plaintiff was young and weak and unable to protest effectively. In September of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the defendant again used the pretext of entrustment to sell sixty pearls to Shen Lianfang for two thousand taels, which he kept for himself. Afterwards, when questioned, he claimed to be temporarily storing the funds. Recently, the plaintiff hired a lawyer and sent a letter demanding the return of the items. The defendant replied that all the jewelry had been taken by the plaintiff in installments and that he only acknowledged the existence of a Tianjin property deed. Furthermore, the embezzled contracts and jewelry were stored in the defendant's private name in the Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank's vault. This case has been heard in court. The defendant claimed that all the jewelry in his possession had been handed over to the plaintiff in installments and that he only had two property deeds for a Tianjin secondhand clothing store. The court then ordered the lawyers of both parties to go to the bank to open the vault and then scheduled a further hearing. When the vault was opened, only one property deed was found in the box. Yesterday was the continuation of the hearing. The defendant presented a receipt from the plaintiff for the jewelry. However, the plaintiff claimed that although he had previously taken jewelry, he had only taken gold jewelry and not diamonds, etc. He had a record book listing the names and quantities of each item. Those items that had been taken had the word "received" written under their names. This book was currently with the plaintiff. The receipt presented by the defendant was different in content from what had been written before. The defendant claimed that there was no such book recording the quantity of jewelry, only a single list. This list was taken away by the plaintiff when he took the jewelry. Subsequently, the plaintiff presented evidence confirming the existence of the account book. The defendant's son came forward and described the circumstances of taking the jewelry. Because he wanted to call witness Lou Mingshi, who was the person who recorded the book, the hearing was adjourned to the 28th of this month.</p>

In recent years, although the demand for domestically produced silk has exceeded supply, foreign goods still flood the market. To achieve large-scale sales of domestically produced silk, a large organization with substantial capital is necessary to counter the invasion of foreign goods. The merger of more than ten factories is a large-scale and indeed a major advancement in the rationalization of the domestic industry. It is also a pioneer in the development of the domestic goods industry.</p>
<h3>Request to the French Municipal Council to Collect Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Suggestion from the Fifth Branch of the Second City Federation</p>
<p>The Fifth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation has requested that the French Municipal Council reform the collection of municipal taxes and fees (i.e., police fees) and require that they be collected in silver dollars. The original letter is recorded below: To the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation: According to a proposal by Committee Member Zhu Ruilin of our branch, since February 10th, our country's tax collection agencies and all industries and trades have uniformly calculated taxes and transactions in silver dollars. However, we have not heard of the concession authorities abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan. It is observed that when the French Concession Municipal Council's collectors collect municipal fees (i.e., police fees) quarterly, they often convert silver taels to silver dollars without using the market price, deliberately lowering the silver price to enrich themselves privately. The losses suffered by our citizens over the years are not insignificant. It is proposed that the Federation send a letter to the General Federation requesting the French Municipal Council to negotiate and implement the collection of municipal fees in silver dollars from now on to benefit the citizens. Based on this proposal, it has been discussed and approved by the Second Executive Committee of our branch that it is indeed necessary for the French Municipal Council to calculate police fees in silver taels without using the market price, causing citizens to bear this extra burden. Committee Member Zhu's proposal is essential. It was decided to send a letter to the Federation requesting immediate discussion and resolution to implement the collection of municipal fees in silver dollars to avoid unreasonable harassment of the people by the collectors and to lighten the burden on the citizens. This decision is recorded for your reference. Please discuss and resolve it for the convenience of the public.</p>

<h3>Review and Future Outlook of an Apprenticeship</h3>
<p>A Letter from Jing Suqian</p>
<p>Dear Reporter,</p>
<p>I am a young man, just turned twenty-one this year. Looking back to when I was seventeen, after graduating from junior high school, I was forced to become an apprentice in a foreign goods and cloth store due to pressing family financial constraints, as I could not afford to continue my education. At the time, I was unwilling to enter business because I felt the pain of being unable to continue my studies and because I had no interest in commerce. However, seeing my family's difficult situation and wanting to alleviate the burden on my parents, I had no choice but to be dominated by this adverse environment. Now, I have been in the store for three full years before finally being promoted to clerk. The hardships and suffering I have endured during these three years are truly beyond words. According to the general practice in stores, apprentices must complete three years of apprenticeship before they can become journeymen, and only then can they be called clerks and receive a fixed salary. During the apprenticeship period, they are only provided with room and board, and their services are purely of an obligatory nature, with no salary allowed. However, if they do not handle matters properly or if their abilities are insufficient, they are reprimanded, even scolded or beaten, which is simply unbearable. As an apprentice, I was not exempt. Let me first tell you about the suffering I have endured. When I entered the store, I had a slight grasp of literacy and was diligent, thrifty, and hardworking in handling matters.</p>
<h3>Price of Silver Bars and Anglo-American Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th. The price of silver bars here today slightly contracted. The spot price is 17 6875 pence, and the forward price is 17 75 pence. Both spot and forward prices have contracted by 0.0625 compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>Today at 3 PM, the London to New York exchange rate is as follows: One pound sterling equals four dollars and thirty-six and a quarter cents. One US dollar equals five shillings and nine and eight hundred forty-four thousandths of a pence.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Shandong coast and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will be clear and slightly mild with occasional cloudy skies. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River will be cloudy with fog. Winds will be variable. The coastal areas south of Ma'anshan Island and the Taiwan Strait will be cloudy with gentle northeasterly winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Mukden was 57.7 degrees, and the lowest was 33.1 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 42.8 degrees, and the lowest was 28.0 degrees.</p>
<p>Therefore, I was quite favored by the manager. However, in reality, it was still not easy. Every day, I did nothing but menial tasks. I got up at dawn, doing nothing but sweeping the floor, starting the stove, washing teacups, wiping lamps, filling the opium pipe, guarding the door, even making the manager's bed, cleaning his chamber pot, serving him tea and opium, and attending to guests, and so on. Calculating on a 24-hour day, I was working at every moment except when sleeping. If I took time to study on my own, such as reading books or writing, that would violate store rules. Everyone would unite to prohibit it. I ask you, what interest is there in such a life? Now that I am a clerk, I should naturally be treated a little better. Who knew that they still would not raise my salary? In addition, there is another matter that is most painful. There is a senior clerk who is inherently wicked and likes to embezzle funds from the accounts to enrich his own pockets. On a certain day in the winter of last year, he was again embezzling a large sum of money on the accounts. At the time, I saw the flaw. Because the matter was related to my future, I did not want to expose it, so I privately discussed it with another apprentice. I thought that since we were colleagues, we often encouraged each other and had a harmonious relationship. What could not be discussed? Who knew that he was a double-dealer who was good at pleasing people? He immediately reported everything to the clerk, who was instantly furious. However, as things were not in his favor, he could only temporarily endure it. But from then on, a grudge was born. Because of his power, he often abused me, treating me as a thorn in his side, constantly trying to eliminate me. My power was isolated, and his friends ganged up on him. How could I defeat him? I could only feign compliance, repeatedly showing obedience and concession, but I still had to be under his command and could not confront him. He also sometimes slandered me in front of the manager, damaging my reputation. Even if I used the last resort, I could not stop him. As the saying goes, "A person's mouth is big, and my mouth is small. A quail's egg cannot touch a green stone." Even if I brought the matter to the manager, the manager would still protect him and criticize me instead. Under the trampling of this kind of adverse environment, there is really no room to struggle. I can only endure in silence, swallowing my voice and appealing without a door. I can only sigh deeply, sitting alone and weeping. Alas, this is truly not a life for human beings. On the other hand, there is also my family. My father passed away two years ago, leaving behind a bleak situation. There is only my kind mother and my younger siblings. We have been borrowing money for years, totaling over a thousand yuan, which cannot be repaid for the time being. However, all the expenses each year must still be borne by me alone. Dear sir, please think for me, what good ways can I find in this dilemma, this difficult situation? How can I solve these many difficulties? At midnight, I pondered that when encountering difficult things in life, one must always find ways to deal with them and strive to overcome them, not sit and wait for death. I now have three options: (1) Resign from my position as a clerk immediately and use my junior high school diploma to seek other, better jobs. (2) Last year, I had two friends, one who went to Shanghai for work and one who went to Zhenjiang for work. They both temporarily promised to help me find a job. Who knew that in nearly a year, there has been no news from them? I also have no way to find out what happened. I often see news in your newspaper about the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center seeking talent, but I do not know what the center's methods are and all the internal matters. I am thinking of going to Shanghai to apply and visit friends along the way. (3) Recently, your newspaper carried news about the Shanghai Aviation Association seeking members. I want to join the association and become a member to learn to fly airplanes as a kind of patriotic movement for young people. In short, a person living in society must always do something amazing and beneficial to the community to plan and display their bright future and seek a lifelong path for themselves. They must not abandon themselves to despair and submit to lowliness, always being dominated by adverse circumstances. I am young and inexperienced, and my views are unclear. I have long admired your great talent and virtue and ask for your generous guidance. Please indicate in the newspaper, item by item, whether my three options are feasible and what other strong and effective ways there are to help me with my family and my store in order to enlighten my ignorance. Then I will be even more grateful for your great kindness and virtue.</p>
<p>Answer: After reading your letter, not only is your writing very good, but your understanding is also quite admirable. There are probably very few junior high school graduates like you. Moreover, what you said is very accurate. Whether it is a store or an organization, they should welcome you. Of course, coming to Shanghai will provide more opportunities to broaden your horizons and increase your knowledge. However, there are now more than 3.2 million people in Shanghai, and there are no few unemployed people. I am afraid that your coming here will also be uncertain. We admire your lofty ambitions for your first option, but we cannot guarantee that you will find a job as soon as you arrive in Shanghai. This is the first point. The second option is also slim. Although there is news in the newspaper about the Vocational Guidance Center seeking talent, we hope that you will not have extravagant expectations. These news items are just advertisements. This is the second point. Recently, various circles in Shanghai have been clamoring about the aviation to save the nation. Of course, you can become an aviation member, but you must not confuse aviation membership with learning to fly airplanes. A regular member has absolutely no chance to learn to fly. That requires another kind of qualification. Otherwise, how many airplanes would be needed to supply everyone with tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of members to learn to fly? In short, you cannot be encountered at home, and you may not have it when you come out.</p>

<h3>Literary Discounts</h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>There is a certain tabloid that prides itself on publishing novels that slander a segment of the population, even alluding to their names. It also states that it will not publish submissions that contain attacks on individuals or groups. This cannot help but make one think of certain things.</p>
<p>Among the foreigners I have met who study Chinese literature, they are often dissatisfied with the exaggeration in Chinese writings. This is truly because, despite studying Chinese literature, they probably will not understand Chinese literature until they die. However, as Chinese, as long as we have read a few hundred articles and seen the behavior of a dozen or so so-called literary figures, and are not just honest young people who have come from the countryside, we will certainly not be fooled. Because we are used to it, just like a clerk in a money shop who, upon seeing banknotes, immediately knows what is circulating, what should be discounted, and what is a worthless bill.</p>
<p>For example, when someone praises your noble appearance by saying that you have ears that hang down to your shoulders, we will at least discount that by half, thinking that they are a little bigger than usual, but certainly not believing that your ears are like a pig's ears. When someone says that their sorrow is like "three thousand feet of white hair," we will at least discount that by twenty thousand, thinking that maybe it is seven or eight feet, but certainly not believing that it is coiled on top of their head like a large haystack. Although these measurements are somewhat vague, they are never too far off. Conversely, we can also increase the small and create the non-existent. For example, when four skinny actors with knives walk out on stage, we know that this is one hundred thousand elite troops. When a publication publishes an article that looks so plausible and serious, we know that there are unseen tricks hidden between the lines.</p>
<p>Conversely, we can even turn the existent into the non-existent. For example, when we hear about "sleeping with spears as pillows awaiting dawn," "sleeping on firewood and tasting gall," or "dedicating loyalty to repay the nation," we immediately see them as blank paper, just like undeveloped photographs that have been exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>But sometimes we still read these articles. Su Shi, when he was demoted to Huangzhou, was so bored that when a guest came, he would talk to him about ghosts. The guest said that there were no ghosts. Su Shi said, "Then you might as well make up some stories." Our reading is just like this, but we can also know that there are such things in society that waste so much boring effort. People often think that playing cards and dancing are harmful, but in fact, these articles are even more harmful because, if you are not careful, you will be taught to be a congenital idiot.</p>
<p>Odes of praise have long been filled with flattery, and the Spring and Autumn Annals have long been filled with concealment. During the Warring States period, debaters would either frighten the listener with danger or move them with beautiful words. Thus, exaggeration and lies emerged endlessly. Although modern literati have changed into Western clothes, their bones are still buried with the ancestors' ways. Therefore, one must take or discount this to reveal a few points of the truth.</p>
<p>If literary figures do not use facts to prove that they have changed their old habits of exaggeration, grandstanding, and lying, then even if they swear to heaven that they will be perfectly honest from now on, otherwise they will be struck by lightning, it is still in vain. Because we have long been accustomed to seeing many families with fake Wang Mazi and three generations of blind eyes gilded signs. Moreover, they are still wagging their little tails.</p>
<h3>Saving the Nation Through Aviation</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>In recent days, the atmosphere of saving the nation through aviation in Shanghai is very strong. Newspapers, the large glass windows of companies, and trams have successively posted advertisements with the eight white characters on a red background: "Save the nation through aviation, everyone participate." Indeed, China should be saved at present. Having fought several battles with Japanese soldiers in the past, people have learned from the experience of war that Japanese airplanes are the most powerful. Therefore, to save the nation and resist the war of Japanese imperialist aggression, there must be a large number of airplanes to assist in the war.</p>
<p>It is said that the nation belongs to the people. Therefore, to save the nation, the people should take the initiative to find ways. Adults and gentlemen say that aviation can save the nation, and the people should find ways to donate money to buy airplanes.</p>
<p>However, one cannot help but suspect that the nation does not seem to have airplanes. If it did, why is there no news of air squadrons resisting the Japanese, and why are the people being asked to find ways? In fact, China does have airplanes, but they are not used to resist the Japanese.</p>
<p>From this fact, we can see that China's airplanes are specially reserved for the government to suppress bandits because this is what the government should do. As for the number of airplanes needed to resist the Japanese, although it is actually saving the common people for the sake of saving the nation, the people should participate quickly and buy more airplanes to resist the Japanese, save the nation, and save themselves.</p>
<h3>Winter in Spring</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>This is not spring; this is winter in spring. The spring light has not yet arrived in the world.</p>
<p>The world is filled with the bleak chill of spring. Low air pressure is tightly binding everyone's heart.</p>
<p>Many people are gathered in front of the newspaper display board, watching. The wind is blowing a corner of the newspaper, flapping. The newspaper is marked with the special bold letters: "Rehe has fallen; Tang Yulin has fled without a fight."</p>
<p>"Damn it, I knew he would have this day," a newspaper reader sighed and said bitterly.</p>
<p>The radio broadcast is spreading news of military defeats. Listeners are shaking their heads.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the gold exchange is very tense. The storm is raging.</p>
<p>The market is filled with rumors, filled with restless souls and uneasy hearts.</p>
<p>Everyone is staring blankly at a sign. The sign is marked with the closing price of the gold market last Saturday: 759.6 taels of silver.</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, the opening price plunged straight down into the 700 tael mark: 698 taels.</p>
<p>At 9:40 AM, it fell another three taels: 695 taels.</p>
<p>At 9:41 AM, rumors arose again in the market that the United States was going to abolish the gold standard. It plummeted 35 taels: 660 taels.</p>
<p>"Oh!" A person fainted in the crowd. The speculators on the losing side are walking like dogs who have lost their homes. The sound of car horns is filled with desolation.</p>
<p>Gloomy clouds are densely covering everyone's heart. It seems that everyone has lost something in their heart.</p>
<p>This is the spring of 1933—winter in spring.</p>
<h3>Paris Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shijun, sent from Paris</p>
<p>(III) The Strange Death of a Strange Man</p>
<p>A good translation is truly a kind of creation. Now, Shan Jing Poem says that in recent years, there have been many people in the motherland who have translated Western poems. Their tireless efforts are enough to inspire respect. But in my personal opinion, what I never tire of reading is the few short lyric poems by Su Manshu translating Byron's Farewell to the Maid of Athens. If poetry is not beautiful, and reading beautiful descriptions is not a beautiful mirror, but beauty itself, just like a fresh flower on paper has its color and fragrance, and its innate, beautiful form, then Su Manshu's few translations can be truly worthy of it. Because of Su Manshu's peculiar life, I am reminded of the strange man in French literary history, Gérard de Nerval. Nerval translated Goethe's Faust. This translation is still considered a treasure in the French literary world. Goethe himself also said that among the various translations of Faust, Nerval's translation can be called the best. Needless to say, Nerval also has many immortal creations. To describe them would take more than a short article. Now, I will only talk about his strange life.</p>
<p>Nerval was born in Paris on May 22, 1808. His father was a military doctor, and his mother died when he was very young. He was raised in his uncle's house. He was a precocious person. At the age of eighteen, he published a collection of six short poems. One day, near dusk during a holiday, he saw a young lady from a wealthy family dancing on the grass with a few village girls. Nerval joined their group. This young lady danced with him once. The person he called Adrienne made him sing a song to her. The song described how a princess of the past fell in love with a man, and her father, angry, imprisoned her in a tower. The tune was very sad. Nerval saw such a beautiful girl and heard such a lingering melody. His soul immediately flew away. Later, Nerval heard that Adrienne had become a nun, and soon after, he heard that she had died. Thus, this beautiful figure never left his mind until the moment Nerval hanged himself. When he was in love with a young actress named Jenny Colon, he treated Colon as a substitute for Adrienne. Therefore, Colon sometimes quarreled with him and bluntly said, "You don't really love me." When Nerval was engaged in writing in Paris, the atmosphere of romanticism swept the French literary world. The actions of the general public were moving in the direction of eccentricity. However, on the surface, Nerval was not as eccentric as his contemporaries. His friends generally said that he was an extremely lovable person. One day, he was walking on the street, holding a leash in his hand, saying to people that this leash would not make a sound, but it knew about the sea. Then, he said a lot of mad things, and people sent him to the hospital. This happened on March 29, 1841. It was not until November 21 of that year that the doctor allowed him to be discharged from the hospital. The main reason for this madness was based on a quarrel with his lover, Colon. On June 5, 1842, Colon died. Nerval naturally suffered a major stimulus. In December of that year, he decided to leave Paris and travel to the East. His reason for deciding to go to the East was partly to forget the pain of Colon's death by traveling far away and partly to let the world know that his madness was completely cured. He stayed in Syria.</p>
<p>When he was in Syria, he fell in love with a young African woman and soon married her. Needless to say, he was again treating her as Adrienne to warm his childhood dreams. This African woman had an unusually passionate personality. Not long after they lived together, she left him and later married a Turk and had many children. At the end of 1843, Nerval returned to Paris alone. Thus, he frequented the secluded streets and small taverns day and night. During these years, he wrote many beautiful articles and translated the works of the German poet Heine into extremely beautiful prose. It was during this period that he began working on the translations. In the spring of 1853, he visited Heine and said all sorts of mad things to Heine. Heine immediately called a carriage to send him to the hospital. Afterwards, he was sometimes well and sometimes sick. After returning from Germany in 1854, his madness relapsed. The doctor diagnosed that there was no hope of him fully recovering. His friends were worried about him, and his actions became more and more bizarre day by day. As soon as he got money, he would use it to buy some unnecessary decorations. The most peculiar thing was that he spent a lot of money to buy a big bed. He told people that a queen had slept on that bed before, and maybe he could get a beautiful woman to sleep on that bed with him. At that time, he did not have much money because he had to rent a larger house because he bought this big bed. So, he sold other things to pay the rent. As a result, all the valuable things he had were sold. He could not borrow money either. The big bed eventually belonged to someone else. He moved to a small place with a low monthly rent. He often carried a belt in his pocket, sometimes saying that it was his wife's skirt belt, sometimes saying that it was a queen's garter. On the night of January 25, 1855, the streets were full of ice. He used this belt to hang himself on the window frame of a small inn. Nerval was truly worthy of being a genius of his generation. His death was also unconventional. It can truly be said that a strange man has a strange death.</p>
<h3>Black Girl Seeks God (28)</h3>
<p>— Written by Xiao Bohn Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"That poet is a fool," the old gentleman said. "We detest him. We wish him dead. We used poison to kill him. We tied him to a wooden stake and burned him alive." "I use my simple methods to do God's work, making his enemies laugh at themselves. But if you tell me which way God has walked, I will crawl into the nearest mouse hole until he has passed by, daring not to breathe, because if he sees me or scolds me, he will step on me like I would step on something that ruined my principles. Did the priest ever tell you the story of Jupiter and Semele?"</p>
<p>"No," the black girl said, "what is that story like?"</p>
<p>"Jupiter is one of the names of God," the old gentleman said. "You know he has many names, right? The last person I met called him God," she said.</p>
<p>"Exactly," the old gentleman said. "Well, Jupiter fell in love with Semele (Note). He was considerate enough, behaving like a mortal to her. But she thought she deserved the love of the great God, so she demanded that he come to her fully adorned in his divine armor."</p>
<p>(Note: The story of Jupiter can be found in Greek mythology.)</p>
<p>"What happened when he came?" the black girl said.</p>
<p>"If she had any sense, she would have known what would happen," the old gentleman said. "She withered and shriveled like a louse in fire, burned to ashes. So be careful, don't be a fool like Semele. God is right by your elbow; he is there all the time. But out of his divine mercy, he has not revealed himself to you, because if you recognized him fully, you would go mad. Build yourself a small garden, dig, plant, weed, and prune. If he touches your elbow when he thinks you are not doing a good job, or blesses you when you are doing well, you should be content."</p>
<p>"Will we never know his full glory?" the black girl said.</p>
<p>"No," the old philosopher said, "because to know his full glory, we must wait until we have fulfilled all his will and become gods ourselves. But his will is infinite, and we are extremely short-lived. We will never catch up with his purposes. Thank God, that is best for us. If we have done our work well, we are no longer of any use. That is our end. Why? Because he would not keep us alive just to enjoy looking at our ugly, short-lived selves. So come in, work in this garden illuminated by God's glory, and don't ask him anything else."</p>

<h3>The Violent Surge of Premiums in Forward Gold Swaps</h3>
<p>Astonishing Increase: Thirty-three Taels and Two Mace</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Overseas Silver Prices, Extreme Shortage of Foreign Exchange in this City</p>
<p>A Flood of Buyers in the Market, Peak at Seven Hundred Sixty-one Taels</p>
<p>Gold Exchange Announces Morning Session to Open as Usual at 9 AM Starting Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Gold Market Experienced Another Sharp Rise with Strong Upward Momentum. Initially, Foreign Cables Reported London Spot and Forward Prices Both Contracting by Half a Penny, New York Silver Prices Dropping by One and a Half Cents, and Both British-American and American-British Exchange Rates Plummeting by One-Quarter to One-Two-Five and Three-Seven-Five. The Exchange Market Opened Tight, with Scalpers Initially Quoting Around Forty Taels. However, Even at This Price, It Was Difficult to Buy. The Opening Was Followed by a Skyrocketing Rise to Seven Hundred Fifty-three Taels. Cantonese Brokers Aggressively Sold and Retreated to Within Fifty Taels, Reaching Forty-five and a Half Taels. Although the Exchange Market Was Firm, June U.S. Dollar at Thirty Yuan Six Two Five (Five-Eighths) Was Accepted by Banks. The HSBC Officially Announced Its Rates at This Time, Estimating a Loss of Half a Penny Sterling and Two and a Half Yuan U.S. Dollar, Which Greatly Boosted Morale. Although There Was a Good Start, It Was Still Peaceful Because the Exchange Market Suddenly Did a Deal in June U.S. Dollars at Eight One Two Five, and Thus Lingered Around Fifty Taels for a Long Time. Although the Pressure Was Great, the Reaction Was Even More Intense. After Entering, June U.S. Dollars Were Sought for Settlement at Six Two Five, Then to Five Six Two Five, Which Was Difficult to Settle. Buyers Still Poured in, Even to Three Seven Five, but No One Was Willing to Sell. Buyers in the Market Were Excited and Even Pushed the Price Up to Sixty Taels. Jardine Matheson Sold June U.S. Dollars at Two Five and Fell Back More Than Four Taels. The Noon Close Was Seven Hundred Fifty-eight Taels and One Mace. The Afternoon Session Opened at Seven Hundred Fifty-four Taels. June U.S. Dollars Were Traded at Two Five and Rose to Seven Hundred Sixty-one Taels. After This, Banks' Appetite Tended to Clog, and the Price Decreased After a Long Struggle. A Cable from Bombay Reported a Decline of Sixteen Annas, Which Was Then Added Back to Sixty-one Taels. However, Because Many Took Advantage of the Rise to Sell, the Domestic Market Was Still Not Good. June U.S. Dollars Were Traded at Four Three Seven Five, Which Was Still Difficult. Gold Prices Were Unsustainable, and the Market Situation Also Grew Bleak, Gradually Falling to Fifty-two Taels. Jardine Matheson Bought June U.S. Dollars at Half a Yuan, and Those Raising Prices Showed Their Might, Thus Pulling the Price Up to Seven Hundred Fifty-five Taels at the Close. It Can Be Seen That the Rising Trend of the Day Was Extreme, and Sellers Were Helpless. Coincidentally, the Near-Term Swap Exchange Market Was Also Very Tight, but the Trend Was Mediocre. This Session's Swap Was Approximately a Short Position Paying More Than Ten Taels. The Actual Situation Today May Be Fully Revealed. Add an Additional Ten Taels. The Three and Four Month Swap Premium Has Already Decreased to Two Taels. Now, the Market Situation of the Day Will Be Recorded Below.</p>
<p>At the Morning Opening, Due to the Sharp Decline in the Overseas Silver Market, the Opening Quotes for Scalpers Immediately Jumped to Around Forty Taels. The Exchange Market Opened with Recent British Exchange at One Shilling, Eight and a Half Pence, and U.S. Exchange at Twenty-nine and a Half Yuan, Both Much Tighter Than the Previous Close. Therefore, Immediately After Opening, It Rose to Within Forty Taels, and Very Few Transactions Occurred. Foo Chong Was the First to Enter, and Bing Hing Also Bought Aggressively, Seeing the Price Rise to Fifty Taels. Jardine Matheson Then Entered, Reaching Fifty-one Taels. Banks Tended to Take, Until the 9:30 AM Opening Was Seven Hundred Fifty-three Taels, Rising Thirty-one Taels and Two Mace from the Previous Close. Then, Shun Lung and Ta Chong Fong Lightly Sold and Retreated. Tin Fong Yung Sold to Within Fifty Taels. Ta Hing Yung Also Sold, and the Price Fell to Forty-eight and a Half Taels. The HSBC Officially Announced Its Rates in the Market, Cutting Half a Penny off Sterling and Two and a Half Yuan off the U.S. Dollar. Gan Cheong Cheung Then Came to Buy, at Fifty Taels. Hang Yueh Then Entered, and the Price Rose to Fifty-two and a Half Taels. Shanghai Offered June U.S. Dollars at Thirty Yuan Zero Three Seven Five. Shun Lung Sold Aggressively, Breaking Down to Within Fifty Taels. Ta Hing Yung Also Sold at Nine Taels. Foo Chong Sold Even Further, at Eight Taels. Wah Yee Sold to Jardine Matheson May U.S. Dollars at Thirty Yuan One Two Five. Shun Lung Was Asked to Sell, and the Momentum Remained Strong, Falling to Forty-five Taels Eight Mace. Jardine Matheson Bought June U.S. Dollars at Six Two Five, Thus Holding Back the Falling Wind. However, Because Shun Lung Continued to Sell, It Could Not Rise Again, Lingering Around Seven Taels. Until Sui Hing Came to Take Delivery, at Nine Taels. Cheung Shing Yung, Hing Fat Yung, and Others Also Came to Buy, and the Price Pierced to Outside Fifty Taels, Reaching Fifty-one Taels. Yee Fung Yung Came to Sell, Again at Forty-eight Taels. Jardine Matheson Still Took June U.S. Dollars at Six Two Five, Standing Firm for a Moment. Bing Hing Came to Sell, Retreating to Within Eight Taels. Four Month U.S. Dollars at Twenty-nine Yuan Were Being Offered by Banks. Foo Chong Came to Sell, at Five and a Half Taels. Maclaren Accepted June at Six Eight Seven Five. Jardine Matheson Also Ate a Lot, Gradually Pulling Up. Sui Hing Suddenly Came to Take Delivery, at Eight and a Half Taels. Foo Yueh Then Sold, Retreating to Seven Taels Two Mace. At This Point, Foo Chong, Hang Yueh, and Others Were All Selling, but Because Chi Fung Yung Entered at a Low Price, It Was Still Pulled Up. The Exchange Market Was Firm, with June U.S. Dollars Being Traded Bank-to-Bank at Eight One Two Five. However, Morale in the Market Was Good, Able to Struggle Extremely Hard at Eight Taels. Until Hang Yueh Entered the Market to Buy, the Price Rose to Outside Fifty Taels. June U.S. Dollars at Six Two Five Were Being Sought for Settlement by Jardine Matheson. Foo Yueh and Ta Hing Yung Competed to Buy, Thus Pushing the Price to Fifty-six Taels Eight Mace. Chun Yuen Yung and Hang Hing Advocated Selling at Three Taels. June U.S. Dollars at Five Six Two Five Could Be Sold but Were Still Being Pulled Up. Chi Fung Yung Entered at Outside Seven Taels. Banks Were All Buying June U.S. Dollars at Three Seven Five Five, Which Also Seemed Difficult to Settle. Foo Yueh and Hing Fat Yung All Took Delivery, Thus Jumping to Above Ten Taels. Jardine Matheson Offered June U.S. Dollars at Two Five, and Then It Was Seen to Retreat Down to Five Taels Eight Mace. Foo Hing Yung Briefly Entered and Raised the Price Again to Seven Hundred Fifty-eight Taels One Mace at the Close. After the Close, Yuan Heng and Foo Chong Came to Sell, and the Price Quickly Dropped to Three and Four Taels. Therefore, Goods Were Only Bid at Five Taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Session Opened at Seven Hundred Fifty-four Taels, Presumably Because the Momentum After the Noon Close Was Still There. Then, at Four and a Half Taels, June U.S. Dollars at Three Seven Five Were Not Being Bought. Hang Yueh Sold at Three and a Half Taels. Yee Fung Yung Came to Enter and Then Held It. Ta Tak Shing Also Bought, Reaching Five Taels. Mitsui Bought Four Month U.S. Dollars at Twenty-nine and a Half Yuan. Gan Cheong Cheung Collected, at Seven Taels. Shanghai Offered June Three Seven Five at Six Taels Three Mace. Ta Hing Yung Bought Again to Outside Eight Taels. Hang Hing Suddenly Entered Aggressively. Gan Cheong Cheung and Chi Fung Yung Seized the Opportunity to Buy. HSBC Sold to Jardine Matheson June U.S. Dollars at Only Two Five, and the Price Soared to Sixty-one Taels. However, Although the Rise Was Quick, the Retreat Was Also Continuous. Yuan Chong Fong Sells at One Time, Dropping to Fifty-Seven Taels. Bing Hing and Yuen Mow Yung Came to Enter, Adding to Eight Taels Eight Mace. Jardine Matheson Offered Four Month U.S. Dollars at Two Five. Foo Yueh Sold to Five and a Half Taels. At This Time, There Was a Slight Wiggle, but Yuen Mow Yung Still Came to Buy, Lingering Around Eight Taels. The Exchange Market Was Not Good. Foo Yueh Briefly Came to Sell Goods, Dropping to Within Seven Taels. June U.S. Dollars at Three Seven Five Were Not Easy to Sell. Hang Yueh and Hung Lee Were All Selling, Still at Six Taels. Mitsui Bought June at Three Seven Five, and Others Also Took the Same Month at Three One Two Five. Although the Exchange Market Was Firm, Buyers in the Market Were Still Excited, Gradually Rising. A Cable from Bombay Reported a Decline of Sixteen Annas, Again Piercing to Sixty Taels, Reaching Sixty-one Taels. Yuen Mow Yung Sold and Still Retreated to Within Sixty Taels. June U.S. Dollars at Three One Five Could Be Settled. Hung Lee and Chao Fong Cheung Were All Selling. Retail Investors Again Came to Aggressively Press Down. Mei Fong Again Offered June at Three Seven Five, at Four Taels Two Mace. However, Because Hang Yueh and Others Entered, They Pulled Up Three Taels. June U.S. Dollars at Four Three Seven Five Were Also Difficult to Sell. Those Selling Were Extremely Strong, Still Trending Downstream. In Addition, Ta Hing Yung Came to Sell Again, and the Price Fell Further to Fifty-two Taels and Stopped. There Was Also a Double Revelation of Prices. Yee Fung Yung and Chao Fong Cheung Raised Prices, and They Tried Their Best to Close at Seven Hundred Fifty-five Taels. After the Close, the Buying Wind Remained. Yee Fung Yung, Foo Shun, and Hip Hing Yung All Took Delivery, Gradually Rising to Eight Taels. Goods Were Then Bid at Seven and a Half Taels. It Can Be Seen That the Highest Price of the Day Was Seven Hundred Sixty-one Taels, the Lowest Price Was Seven Hundred Forty-five and a Half Taels, With a Difference of Ten and a Half Taels. As a Result, Compared to the Previous Close, It Rose Sharply by Thirty-three Taels and Two Mace.</p>
<p>Price Revelation: Due to the HSBC Exchange Bank's U.S. Exchange Rate Contraction of Two and a Half Yuan, Estimated at Twenty-eight Yuan and Seventy-five Cents, Equivalent to a Gold Premium Price of Eight Hundred Thirty-four Taels Seven Mace Eight Fen. In Terms of the Closing Price, Approximately Seventy-nine Taels Were Pressed Down, More Than Thirty-three Taels Stronger Than the Previous Close. This Month's Account Was Logged at Seven Hundred Sixty Taels. April's Was Seven Hundred Fifty-eight Taels. The Morning Supplement Was Seven Hundred Fifty-eight Taels. The Afternoon Was Seven Hundred Fifty-five Taels.</p>
<p>Different Supply and Demand in Market Transactions. The Transaction Volume in the Previous Session Was Slightly Lower Than the Later Session. In Summary, Hang Hing, Gan Cheong Cheung, Sui Hing, Chi Fung Yung, Yuan Shin Yung, Yuan Mow Yung, Hing Fat Yung, Hang Hing, Yuan Cheung Shing Yung, Foo Yueh All Entered. Shun Lung, Chao Fong Cheung, Foo Chong, Ta Hing Yung, Bing Hing, Hung Lee, Ta Tak Shing, Chun Yuen Yung, Etc., All Sold. Yee Fung Yung and Hang Yueh First Sold and Then Entered. The Ta Lien Gang Had Very Few Transactions. The Cantonese Gang, Hang Hing, Collected About Two Hundred Bars. Shun Lung, On the Other Hand, Had More Than Six Hundred Bars. The Amount of April Bars as of the Previous Day Totaled More Than Twenty-three Thousand Nine Hundred.</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange Announcement Said That From the 15th Onward, the Previous Session Would Open as Usual at 9 AM. This Is a Special Announcement.</p>
<p>The Premium Continued to Fall Yesterday, Still Due to the Violent Rise in Forward Premiums, and the Sellers Were Already Active. Initially, the Quoted Price in the Market Ranged From Plus Ten Taels to Thirteen and a Half Taels, With Few Formal Transactions. Buyers Were Willing to Pay Ten Taels. In the Market, Wing Fung Hang Took Delivery, and Cantonese Brokers Sold. Approximately Two Hundred Taels Were Transacted at a Price of Plus Ten Taels. The Swap Also Jumped Up by Thirty Due to the Rising Premium. Generally, Cash Brokers Seem Willing to Swap Out Cash. Wing Fung Hang Then Came to Offer. Hui Yuen Offered Fourteen Bars (Three-Four Months) at Only Two Taels. Other Than This, There Were Few Formal Transactions. Because, Apart From Cash Brokers, Except for the Central Bank, Most Long Positions Were Absent. However, It Is Feared That This Price May Not Be Willing to Be Swapped Out. The Amount of March Bars Remaining as of the Previous Day Was Four Hundred Sixty-two.</p>
<p>Thirty-five Bars Were Cleared From Public Orders by Wing Fung Hang, Seven Bars by Yung Fong, Fourteen by Lun Cheung Yue, and Seven by Tung Fong Hang and Ta Shun, Totaling Forty-two Bars Received and Cleared.</p>

<p>The Closing of the International Basketball Tournament</p>
<h3>China Wins the Men's Championship</h3>
<p>Defeated the United States Again Last Night 37 to 35</p>
<p>Britain Wins the Women's Championship</p>
<p>Defeated the United States by a Large Margin 51 to 13</p>
<p>The Chinese basketball team defeated the United States for the second time last night with a score of 37 to 35, winning this year's Shanghai International Basketball Championship and retaining the ABC Cup for one year. The situation in this battle was tense from beginning to end, with the scores differing only slightly. In the end, China took the lead with 35 to 28, but with only three minutes remaining, China took a defensive posture, hoping to maintain the victory. Unexpectedly, the US team took the opportunity to counterattack, trying to retaliate, and chased to 35 to 37. China was only two points ahead and in a precarious situation. Fortunately, time had run out, and it was said that it was dangerous to hold on to the territory. However, the performance was far from as good as the last time. In another women's group match, Britain defeated the United States by a large margin of 51 to 13, and the women's championship went to Britain.</p>
<h3>The History of the ABC Cup</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Basketball Championship has a long history. Over the years, the championship has been contested by China and the United States. The women's competition started in 1930. The ABC Cup was presented by ABD China Underwear Company starting in 1930, with one cup for men and one for women, the men's cup being larger and the women's cup smaller. Those who win three consecutive years or win three years first will permanently retain it as a souvenir. The US women's team won two consecutive times in 1930 and 1931. Last year, the competition was suspended due to the war. This year, the US women's team was unfortunately defeated miserably, otherwise the cup would have been permanently owned by the United States. As for the men's group, China won in 1930, the United States won in 1931. Last year, the competition was suspended, and this year the victory was returned to China. The ownership of the cup still depends on the competition in the coming year. In addition, the XieJin Association will present each member of the men's and women's championship teams with a small silver cup as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Britain Wins the Women's Championship</h3>

The United States initially had ambitions to overwhelm Britain and form a three-legged situation between China, the United States, and Britain, and hold another final to win the championship. However, under the engagement, the United States was far from being an enemy of Britain, and it was a one-sided situation. The US defense was overwhelmed, and the forward had no chance to get the ball, while the British performance was extremely outstanding, making it impossible for the US team to resist. As a result, Britain won by 51 to 13, with the first half at 27 to 4. Referee Zhou Jiaqi's results are as follows: Britain Fouls Score United States Fouls Score Y.

<h3>The Chinese Team Wins the Men's Championship</h3>
<p>Last night's second final between China and the United States was even more popular than the last time, with over 1,500 spectators. The battle unfolded as follows:</p>
<p>Deadlock. The initial clash saw both sides' formations in disarray. The American Smith scored first, but China missed several shots. Then, Qian Jingyong scored one point for China, and Lu Zhongsi scored another, giving China a one-point lead. Smith quickly made a turnaround shot, scoring, and Feng Nianhua responded with two points, leveling the score at 5-5. The tension was high, and despite the difficulty, neither side yielded. After a long standoff, White scored, giving the US a 7-5 lead. China immediately leveled the score with a shot by Kong Guangyi. Later, Zeer and Lu Zhongsi each scored two points, again tying the score at 9-9. The US surged ahead amidst intense play. Peerless charged forward and scored, but at the same time, Feng Nianhua committed a foul. Peerless missed the free throw, but Zeer jumped up and scored. The US suddenly gained four points, boosting their momentum. Peerless and White each earned two more points from free throws, and China suddenly trailed by six points (9-15), causing disappointment among the audience.</p>
<p>China Reverses the Defeat. After this setback, China did not lose heart. Instead, they rallied their spirits and displayed tremendous energy. Lu Zhongen and Feng Nianhua successively scored, boosting morale. Wu Guolin also scored a goal, and Feng Nianhua added two more points. The score reversed, with China taking the lead at 17-15. The American Zeer leveled the score, but Xiao Feng scored again, giving them another lead at 19-17, which ended the first half.</p>
<p>Tense Situation. After the break, the US team launched a fierce attack, striving to advance. Smith and Kulaqiu successively scored two points, taking the lead (21-19). Kong Guangyi leveled the score, and the two sides traded points. At this time, the situation was balanced, and it was difficult to tell who was superior. Although China had a slight advantage, the US was closely following and did not let up. From 22-23, 24-25, all the way to 26-27. But thereafter, the American team suddenly declined, rarely scoring. This was due to China's tight defense, leaving no openings. This went to 35-28, with China leading by seven points.</p>
<p>Nearly a Calamity. With only three minutes left, China thought victory was assured, so Sun Shiqing was brought in to adjust the team, and Lu Zhongen was taken out. Then Lu Zhongen was brought back and Qian Jingyong taken out, hoping to play defensively and secure the victory. Unexpectedly, the US seized the opportunity and launched a counterattack with great momentum. Shi Guiya and Zeer successively scored, and the score gradually narrowed, reaching 37-35. The US was still surrounding the basket, struggling to score. At this time, China was in great danger, and a clever move almost backfired. Fortunately, time ran out, and China finally won by a narrow margin of two points. Referees were Li Zuqi and Hall of China.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Homemade Smoke Screen</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Whenever there is resistance against Japan, there is always propaganda about self-made flying mines, rockets, and other weapons, but the result is just wishful thinking. We only hear about enemy planes wreaking havoc, and we don't hear about flying mines being effective. Flying mines are like that, and rockets, which are even less effective, can only be like the "Nine Dragons Fetching Water" in firecrackers, providing New Year's toys for children.</p>
<p>Recently, something that is barely satisfactory is the Guangdong Provincial Industrial Testing Institute's successful production of homemade smoke screens. It was tested on the 5th of this month in the open space near Zhongshan Hall and achieved considerable results. According to the report from the director of the testing institute, Chen Yaozhen, the smoke screen is used in wartime to protect one's own troops' advance and retreat, and can also confuse the enemy's target, acting as a strategy of making the false seem real and the real seem false. The smoke screen is divided into five colors: yellow, blue, purple, black, and white. Among them, the white one has the greatest shielding power. When all the other colors are used, and the sea and sky are filled with fog, it can be used to achieve the effects of cover and deception. After research by the institute's technical personnel in groups, two types of white smoke screens and multiple types of yellow and purple smoke screens have been made, which can be used for anti-Japanese war supplies. Only after suffering losses from the enemy's smoke bombs did we think of making our own smoke screens. This kind of effort is close to digging a well only when thirsty. But if the well is dug easily when thirsty, that's a good thing. Therefore, when I got the news of the homemade smoke screen, I thought it was a barely satisfactory move. If we are propagating ideal weapons to defeat the enemy, but there is no such thing in the end, then this is not just digging a well when thirsty, it is simply draining the well completely when thirsty. Can drawing a well on paper when thirsty, no matter how realistic it is, quench people's extraordinary thirst? Therefore, for Guangdong Province's homemade smoke screen, I only hope that it is digging a well when thirsty, and not drawing a well on paper when thirsty.</p>
<h3>What to Love and What to Strive For</h3>
<p>— Huoyunming</p>
<p>The ugliness that is created.</p>
<p>Establish your footing and choose your steps, open your eyes and see what to do.</p>
<p>How many things should be done in this world? Only when they are done do we see their strangeness. This is the life philosophy of Li Yucun, a poet of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty. The motivation for writing this poem was purely to correct a couplet on the door of a certain secretary: "Establish your footing and follow your preferences, open your eyes and do not contend with anything." So the poet Li said, "I think that if you follow your preferences, you don't know whether what you like is right or not. If you don't contend with anything, you don't know whether what you should contend with is right or not. What you like, such as benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and faith, is what you should like. Otherwise, eccentricity, heresy, extravagance, and licentiousness can also be liked. What you should contend with, such as loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and virtue, must be contended for. Otherwise, the love of power, harming the country, damaging customs, and undermining morality are also things you should not contend with."</p>
<p>Looking at this passage, one can imagine how dignified and cautious he was in his conduct and how he must choose carefully before deciding what to do. If you do this, you will naturally be a loyal minister and honest official in the court, and a martyr and enlightened person in the wild. Even more, you can have faith. He advocated that what should be contended for must be contended for, and what should be liked should be liked, and it is not appropriate to only pay lip service. Today, the glamour of sensuality fills the red and green cities. Rouge, lipstick, dancing without socks, and revealing fashions, etc., have intoxicated the young masters of the gold-yuan society. It seems too difficult to say that there are no eccentricities, heresies, extravagance, and licentiousness. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and faith have been spurned by the Western-suited Chinese with new ideas. It is not a recent trend. As long as you read the social section of the tabloids, which publish bandits, lust, lawsuits, blackmail, duels, and suicides every day, this is what modern people like.</p>
<p>Regarding the struggle for power and profit, it is more valuable than life and must be contended for. Tang Yulin could cheaply cede Rehe Province, but his own pearl treasures were loaded onto 200 cars and transported back to Tianjin. The generals who sang loudly that they were willing to be the vanguard and serve the party and the country only remained stationed and refused to sacrifice their own strength to truly resist Japan. These phenomena are everywhere in the country, and no one stood up to contend with them. It seems too difficult to say that there are no power-hungry traitors harming the country. The originator is happy, and his subordinates follow his example. To the country, he is disloyal; to his father, he is not avenging his father's hatred, so he is unfilial; to the people, he is plundering their wealth, so he is corrupt; to himself, he is a slave with a bent knee, so he is not virtuous, damaging customs and making the nation suffer great shame. Is there anything worse than this? What should not be liked is liked with relish, and what should be contended for is ignored. How can China be revived? What is created is only ugliness.</p>
<h3>Lu Genrong's Confession</h3>
<p>— Min Sun</p>
<p>This seems to be a tragic and gratifying event. Lu Genrong, the protagonist of the Huang-Lu case, has news of joining the army. After he was released from prison, he felt that his family affairs were as chaotic as the national situation. To govern the family, he must first save the country, so he decided to go north and join the army. The night before his departure, he gave a letter to Xu Jun, a prominent figure in Shanghai, in which he said, "I will not return alive unless I kill an enemy or capture Tang Yulin alive." These words may have been spoken because he was too deeply stimulated, but he only admitted that it was a confession of his past after he was released from prison.</p>
<h3>Under the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Yao Ying</p>
<p>It is a fundamental mistake to watch slapstick movies and criticize them with serious analytical eyes, because the core of slapstick is simply nonsensical fun.</p>
<p>Children under the age of fifteen who watch romantic films feel the same boredom as critics who watch slapstick.</p>
<p>None of the movie stars are unhappy watching their own test screenings. However, after watching the film, they even ask themselves, "How could I have done such things?"</p>
<p>The appearance of female stars is easier to impress people's minds than the profound performances of male stars, so there are more and more female stars, and few male stars are heard of.</p>
<p>The reason why Chinese people don't like to watch domestic films is that the plots and performances are understandable to Chinese people.</p>
<p>Small children held in arms don't need to buy tickets, so you can often hear crying during the screening.</p>
<p>In movie theaters with seats priced above half a yuan, there are many ice cream paper cups, coconut cocoa paper boxes, and Dutch water bottles on the floor. In movie theaters with seats priced below half a yuan, there are many watermelon seed shells, spiced bean skins, and small squares of colored paper used for lining.</p>
<p>Wearing glasses and loudly reading the instructions, and wearing suits and reading English subtitles, facing each other from afar, chattering incessantly, are special characters in small movie theaters. The psychology of fighting for seats is for the sake of rights. The crowding at the end of the screening is truly inexplicable.</p>
<p>People who like to watch martial arts films are not watching the duels, but watching flying over walls and white light, and heads falling to the ground.</p>
<h3>Jiao Bing Lu (Chewing Ice Record)</h3>
<p>Squid stalls are full in front of middle school gates. I think students who are receiving secondary education cannot be unclear about whether this is a domestic product or a product of hate, but, alas, the squid stalls' business is not bad because of this. Students are crowded around the stalls. People say it is Japanese goods, but they insist it is Guangdong squid. Although the fact tells us that there are very cheap squid for sale in Hongkou, the middle school students with strong faith are still chewing it, they firmly believe that this is Guangdong goods, alas, what else can be said?</p>
<p>The movie theater has a huge advertisement in the newspaper, plus words like "sexy" and "sensual," which are enough to attract everyone, and the viewers flock to it. However, the disaster relief association publishes the same huge advertisement, asking people to donate for disaster relief, but the results are not as good? Maybe it's because I forgot to add the words "forget" and "sexy"? Indeed, the Northeast is showing sensuality. The corpses are exposed on the battlefield, absolutely sensual, but unfortunately the people in the city have not seen them. Later, I think to publish such advertisements, it is best to add "Our sensuality is genuine, if you don't believe it, please go to the Northeast to see it and see that it is not wrong!"</p>
<p>An old man died. When his children put him in the coffin, they cried so miserably, but in normal times they often scolded him "old and immortal," what is the contradiction between the attitude before and after? This made me yearn for a long time, but later experience told me that people are always under the cover of pretense. If you don't mourn and exhaust your etiquette when your elders die, you will be criticized, even if you can't cry (of course, you can only be happy now that you are hoping for his death), you have to dryly howl a few times, ah, the hypocritical society, this is just a symbol of a corner of this society!</p>

<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 1</p>
<p>Pushing food diligently invites poor women to remember, entering the door generously shows the heroism of a military man. Zhao Ziqiang seemed to know something, turned his face to Jiang Shi and said, "Old lady, do you think I am a bit crazy in doing things? Actually, it's not. I first thought she was a chauffeur of a rich man, showing off his power, causing trouble outside, so I had to compare my power with him. Later, he said that he was also the son of a poor family, and he also had some filial piety. I love my father myself, of course, others also love their fathers, shouldn't I be able to understand others a little bit?" Jiang Shi smiled and said, "Company Commander Zhao, you have a good heart, you will definitely have good benefits in the future." Zhao Ziqiang smiled slightly and rode away on his horse. Jiang Shi walked back to the house, and the old girl greeted her mother and said, "Who did you just say has a good heart?" Jiang Shi then told the story of Zhao Ziqiang just now. Because of the way, "It's true, good iron is not used to make nails, good people are not soldiers, this is not right. People like Company Commander Zhao, who are gentle and cheerful, can they not be good people?" The old girl smiled and said, "Speaking like this, you are willing to have this neighbor." Jiang Shi nodded and said, "This kind of person, not to mention being a neighbor, it is good to make friends, and it is good to climb relatives, I am willing." The old girl blushed and said, "What are you talking about?" Jiang Shi then realized that she had misspoke, but it was too late to cover it up.</p>
<p>Episode 2</p>
<p>A humble room forms a fragrant neighborhood, secretly admiring the old man. A powerful family chooses a good companion, denouncing greedy dolls.</p>
<p>The few words that Jiang Shi said casually really didn't have any meaning. When her daughter expressed dissatisfaction, she felt that it was wrong, so she smiled and said, "It doesn't matter, I just said he was a good person." The old girl took the wooden box from the edge of the kang, took out Gan Erye's package of clothing material, measured and looked at it, the package of clothing material was just found. Jiang Shi smiled and said, "Oh, if you hadn't taken out this clothing material, I would have forgotten it. People are still wearing silk robes, aren't they wearing robes?" The old girl heard this and laughed, and said, "Look at your memory." Jiang Shi took the clothing material in her hand and measured it on the kang, and the old girl helped her get the scissors, the ash thread bag, and took out the iron, planning to put it on the stove to heat it up.

<p>Foreword Last time, we invited Mr. Ding Song, a famous calligrapher who doesn't write much, to write an article "Lying on the Board Door," which was very moving. This time, we are trying to get Mr. Dong Zhexian, a jurist and calligrapher who doesn't write much, to do it, with the title "The Story of the Newlywed Joining the Army," which is also fresh and delightful. Yilan of West Lake is the pen name used by Mr. Dong when writing couplets and hall scrolls for people, and it is an old brand in the calligraphy world.</p>
<p>Each has its own merits</p>
<h3>The Story of the Newlywed Joining the Army</h3>
<p>— Yilan of West Lake</p>
<p>The east neighbor of my house, I don't know his surname. There is a young man in his house, and my family all calls him the newlywed. Because a few days after his family moved in, this young man held a wedding ceremony, so he was called the newlywed. Even after a long time, his name is still new. This can also show the lack of neighborliness in Shanghai. In Shanghai alleys, people live in adjacent houses, but they don't interact with each other. When they meet, they don't greet each other. Even if they are separated by a wall, they have lived together for five or seven years, but they still don't know their neighbors' surnames. However, although Shanghai residents lack neighborliness, the servants and maids are most happy to talk about the rights and wrongs of their neighbors in their spare time: "A certain wife fought with a monk" "A certain concubine is a Cantonese salt water sister"</p>
<p>"A certain male master was caught in adultery by his wife and slapped three times;"</p>
<p>But since the name is unknown, how can you specify it when you say it? Then there is a substitute nickname: such and such a thin eldest son, a big head, a one-eyed man, a red nose, a Cantonese old man, a Suzhou girl, etc., are all brought to be used as names. In my alley, there are two of the strangest nicknames: one is Shandong Steamed Bun, and the other is Full of Stars. Full of Stars is the newlywed's grandmother. Does this refer to her full head of white hair? I don't know.</p>
<p>One day, around nine o'clock in the evening, Full of Stars cried loudly in the house, and then heard two or three women crying: "The newlywed is dead." Since Shanghai lacks neighborliness, his family's death has nothing to do with other families. But until the next day, there was no funeral in the newlywed's house, and the neighbors rumored: "It's not that the newlywed died, it's that the newlywed ran away." Someone else said, "It's not running away, it's joining the army." The two words "joining the army" gathered a crowd of people in the alley, including mothers, older sisters, coachmen, and chefs, and they used a consensus system to discuss it for a long time, but they didn't get a clear answer; the coachman who spread the word from the newlywed's family explained: "Joining the army means fighting, going to the Northeast to fight with the Japanese."</p>
<p>So everyone was suspicious again, saying: "The newlywed is not a soldier;" and said: "Since his family allowed him to go, why did they cry so madly when he set off last night?" Everyone gathered many questions and opened their mouths together, surrounding the coachman. The coachman said: "It wasn't that he set off last night, he said he was going to Nanjing to see friends four days ago, and then he left; last night a quick letter came, saying that he had "joined the army, and there was no need to ask about life and death..." The whole family read the letter and cried, but there was one strange thing, everyone cried, but the new young lady did not cry; not only did she not cry, but she also laughed and said 'good.'" After the coachman finished speaking, everyone was suspicious again: "It must be that the bride has bad intentions;" someone else said: "</p>
<p>Her stomach is also big, so she shouldn't have bad intentions; she must be frightened and got a crazy disease." From then on, the newlywed's home was uneasy, and everyone in the alley was uneasy. Everyone's uneasiness was because the neighbors in the alley paid more attention to his family's affairs than to their own! Every afternoon, they had to hold an open-air meeting; when they passed the newlywed's door, they had to stick their heads out and act like Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Xifengkou Fall into Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>Repeatedly Attacked by Our Troops, Suffering Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Unable to Succeed Outside the Pass, Will Intrude on Pingjin</p>
<p>After the Enemy's Reinforcements Arrive, They Counterattack Our Troops, Fierce Fighting is Underway</p>
<p>Beiping, Xifengkou, Song Zheyuan's troops launched an attack on the enemy on the 14th evening, and the enemy suffered extremely heavy losses in hand-to-hand combat, and the morale of the army has been disrupted. (Special Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Beiping, Enemy Reinforcements are Arriving in the Xifengkou Area (Special Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Beiping, After the enemy reinforcements arrived in Xifengkou, they counterattacked again yesterday. Because many cannons were destroyed and captured by our troops, they only attacked with rifles. Song Zheyuan and others personally directed the battle at the front line, and the battle situation was extremely fierce. (Special Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Beiping Foreign News, Because the enemy suffered heavy losses in the fierce battle of Xifengkou, they decided to actively attack into the pass, plotting to disturb my Pingjin (Special Dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Jinzhou, Song Zheyuan's army in Xifengkou took active action against the Japanese army again on the evening of the 14th and began to attack the Japanese army. They are currently engaged in battle, and the Chinese army's artillery fire became more intense in the evening, and there was a continuous disturbance of reinforcements. The Hattori Brigade fell into a hard battle, and the situation was very serious (Japanese Allied Telegraph on the 15th)</p>
<p>Prefecture, The Hattori Unit outside Xifengkou was repeatedly attacked fiercely by the Chinese army, and each time a large number of troops were sacrificed. The Japanese army's work of attacking Rehe is about to come to an end, but the current situation cannot be said that Rehe is completely secured by Japan. If this continues, the Japanese army's sacrifice will return to nothing. The Japanese authorities are currently monitoring the future of the battle of Xifengkou. If they still cannot overcome Xifengkou, they will resort to a second means (Japanese Allied Telegraph on the 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, The Japanese newspaper's editorial has recently been urging the Japanese military not to disturb Pingjin again and to stop at the Great Wall, otherwise Britain, France, and the United States will be involved in the war, China will forever be an enemy of Japan, and there will be a serious blow to peace in the Far East. This is enough to show that the military has a very clear plan to disrupt Pingjin. According to investigations, the outline of the war expansion theory advocated by the young and middle-aged factions of the Japanese military is as follows: (1) If Pingjin is not occupied, the Chinese government will never yield, and a neutral zone of 20 kilometers south of the Great Wall will be demarcated to maintain the security of "Manchukuo." (2) The navies of the United Kingdom and the United States dare not fight against the Japanese navy at present. During the period when Japan's naval superiority is overwhelming, if they do not seize the places they want as soon as possible, they will lose their good opportunity forever. (3) The Japanese national character is both hot and cold, and if they do not use the expansion of military affairs to appeal to the patriotic hearts of the people, they are afraid that the decline of the national economy will cause the anti-warlord faction to take advantage of the opportunity to act. In this way, all previous achievements will be lost, and in the past two or three months, the people's enthusiasm for supporting the military is not as enthusiastic as last year.

<h3>Saito's Position Shaken</h3>

The procedures for withdrawing from the League of Nations can also be completed during the Diet session.

Justice Minister Oyama and Education Minister Hatoyama will face responsibility issues due to the Communist Party incident. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito has decided to resign en masse.</p>
<h3>Japan's Foreign Policy After Withdrawing from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th. The Privy Council's Special Investigation Committee is expected to ask questions about the consultation on the withdrawal from the League of Nations. However, there will be no objection to the measures taken by the Japanese government when Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the League of Nations applies. However, regarding foreign policy after withdrawal, it hopes to shift away from the League of Nations and establish a flexible foreign policy.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th. The Japanese government has distributed supplementary documents to the consultation on the League of Nations notice, namely the handling methods for various cases after the withdrawal notice (excluding the mandate issue) to the Privy Council Review Committee. The gist is as follows:</p>
<p>First, during the two years after the notice of withdrawal, although it has the rights and obligations of a League of Nations member, it will send representatives to attend the General Assembly and the Council, but it will be absent according to practice. Second, from the notice of withdrawal until the end of the two-year period, there is an obligation to pay the League of Nations expenses and contributions. Third, League of Nations staff are appointed by the Secretary-General with the consent of the Council. Therefore, the League of Nations and the individual are merely an employer-employee relationship and have no direct relationship with the individual's government. There is no difference whether the individual's country is a League of Nations member or a non-League of Nations member. Therefore, although Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it does not affect the status of the staff. Therefore, the Japanese government does not interfere in any way with the advancement or retirement of Japanese staff, and allows it to be free and unconstrained. However, if someone voluntarily resigns, then measures to save them should be discussed. Also, after the Japanese government gives notice of withdrawal, the methods of cooperation with various specialized agencies of the League of Nations are: (1) When withdrawing, carefully consider the internal and external sensitive situation, and advance towards the established policy. At the same time, adopt a fair attitude towards China and other European and American relations to avoid the occurrence of incidents, and sincerely participate in general peace affairs to ease internal and external anxieties. (2) Although it will not attend the political General Assembly and Council, it will still participate and cooperate in other peace affairs as long as there are no special circumstances changes. (3) In addition, it will still participate in the Mandates Commission, the International Public Health Bureau, the International Aeronautical Commission, the International Hydrographic Association, the Straits Commission, the Transportation Conference, and the Central Opium Committee. (4) It will still participate in the International Economic and Financial Conference. (5) It will still participate in the International Labor Conference.</p>

<p>Guangzhou. Merchants here, fearing that the Sino-Japanese war will extend to mainland China and that the Japanese will blockade various Chinese seaports, are actively discussing methods of storing grain.

Therefore, local merchants are now proposing to raise 10 million yuan to purchase rice and store it for emergency use. This proposal has been submitted to the local authorities for approval. The defeat in Rehe has greatly shaken the local population. Public organizations are making even greater efforts to raise funds to support the Volunteer Army and purchase aircraft.

<h3>France Protests to Germany Over Armed Occupation of Kehl Incident</h3>
<p>Alleging Violation of the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Claims Party Members Are Not Soldiers</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 14th. The French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, called on Foreign Minister Neurath today to protest the occupation of the barracks in Kehl by the Hitler Sturmabteilung, and said that the Kehl incident was not long after the Homberg bridge incident, both of which were caused by Hitler's troops, which endangered Franco-German relations. Regarding legal issues and whether Hitler's troops occupying cities in demilitarized zones conflicted with the treaties signed since the Treaty of Versailles, François-Poncet reserved his opinion. He said that this incident has particularly shocked the French people and has caused anxiety in all countries. German Foreign Minister Neurath took note of this protest and did not deny the misfortune of this matter, but said that the Kehl barracks were only temporarily occupied, and only about one-tenth of the Hitler Stormtroopers were armed with pistols or rifles, so they should not be considered soldiers. Moreover, the Hitler Stormtroopers were only a political body, and they went to Kehl only to maintain order because of the volatile situation. When the French Ambassador spoke with the German Foreign Minister, he did not mention questions such as whether private troops being incorporated into auxiliary police forces and other measures were in accordance with the treaty.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th. British officials believe that the armed occupation of cities such as Kehl, Cologne, and Wesel by the National Socialist stormtroopers is part of Germany's policy. If so, Germany's violation of the provision in the Treaty of Versailles that there should be no military activity in the demilitarized zone is merely a tactical issue and not Germany's intention.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 14th. According to the semi-official "Political Foreign Correspondence" agency, the National Socialist stormtroopers serving as auxiliary police in the demilitarized zone are not in violation of the current treaty, and that the Hitler stormtroopers have been in the Rhineland since the Allied forces withdrew from Germany and have no military nature.</p>
<h3>British Air Force Budget</h3>

British air force expenses have been greatly reduced since 1925, but other countries have greatly increased them. Air power is extremely important to the British Empire and is comparable to sea power, so we must not neglect it.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Considering Convention Details During Recess</h3>
<p>Germany Insists on Equality and Will Not Concede</p>
<p>MacDonald's Mediation May Not Achieve Anything</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 14th. After meeting with representatives from various countries here, British Prime Minister MacDonald is now considering the details of the disarmament agreement. MacDonald is making this agreement as broad, complete, concrete, and non-abstract as possible. The British spokesman stated today that the recess of the Disarmament Conference is useless in the current European situation, and that Europe is currently in decline.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 14th. British Ambassador to Germany Sir Horace Rumbold discussed the disarmament issue with the Foreign Minister today. The German Foreign Minister stated that Germany's attitude has not changed. In other words, unless all countries disarm, Germany is free to adopt necessary plans to ensure its security.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 14th. The German nationalist newspaper Börsen-Zeitung reported that Germany should enjoy equal rights in military equipment and security as other countries. If the Disarmament Conference fails again, the provisions restricting German military equipment in the Treaty of Versailles will become invalid based on the principle of equality.</p>

<h3>Polish Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Relations with Russia:</p>
<p>Poland's foreign policy last year was based on consolidating international relations and safeguarding European peace. Every action it took externally was based on this principle. On January 27th, Poland settled the Polish-Soviet non-aggression treaty. This treaty had been under negotiation for six years without result. Now, on November 27, 1932, it was formally ratified by both countries. According to this Polish-Soviet non-aggression treaty, it fulfills the Kellogg-Briand Pact recorded in the Moscow draft agreement of 1929. This treaty integrates various perspectives on aggression, providing a new and clear framework for international relations. The new aspect of this treaty has attracted the attention of scholars of international law. Mr. Jessup of the World Peace Foundation stated that the Polish-Soviet treaty formula disregards the form and legal nature of being unable to declare war, thereby reducing the defense equipment of autocratic countries, but in practice, it aims to achieve its effect. In short, the ratification of this treaty by Poland and Russia is the greatest success in safeguarding European peace in 1932.</p>
<p>Relations with Germany:</p>
<p>Following the restoration of relations with its eastern neighbor, the issue of Polish-German relations arises. In the past year, Poland has frequently been provoked by Germany. Poland has been falsely accused of harboring ambitions to invade the Free City of Danzig and East Prussia. However, Poland's response has been nothing more than striving with all its intelligence to improve relations between the two countries. Recently, Poland has diligently sought to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty with Germany. This proposal was seen in the semi-official Polish Gazette on November 19th of last year. However, the German official and public sectors have ignored it, just as they have treated various proposals in the past. Nevertheless, Poland should continue to devote itself to promoting Polish-German relations, as this is the core of Central European politics. Whether it will succeed in the future depends entirely on Germany's attitude.</p>
<p>Disarmament Issues:</p>
<p>Another contribution Poland has made to international cooperation is its moral disarmament plan, which is the proposal discussed at the Geneva Disarmament Conference in 1932. The theme of this plan is to create an atmosphere that cannot wage war, and it advocates that each country's criminal law should regulate and punish all individuals or groups that incite war in order to achieve non-war objectives. The legislation of countries such as Brazil, Romania, and Poland has already implemented this principle. This suggestion reaffirms extreme patriotic sentiments, but only morality can restrain them. If countries develop a new moral concept and use law to punish those who advocate war as a solution to national disputes, then war will have no basis for occurring. Poland has put forward a specific plan for international adoption. Furthermore, Poland has also provided input on economic international cooperation. Under Poland's guidance, Central European agricultural countries have begun to adopt common strategies. This is an important contribution to the Stresa Conference. Poland's efforts in international cooperation led to it receiving 48 out of 51 votes on October 3, 1932, and being elected as a member of the League of Nations Council.</p>
<h3>German Social Democratic Party Ends Anti-Jewish Activities</h3>

<p>Reuters, 14th, Cologne dispatch: The Nazi Party's anti-Jewish activities seem to have ended. Jewish-owned shops are now able to operate normally without harassment.

Afterwards, three people were arrested. According to the authorities today, these three people have been removed from the party and will be sent to court for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Search and Seizure of Drug Manufacturing Site in Dazinzhuang, Northern Henan</h3>
<p>Handled by Security Corps</p>
<p>Destroyed dens, factories, and equipment</p>
<p>Regrettably, key suspects escaped before hearing of it</p>
<p>Xinxiang Dispatch: Dazinzhuang, in Bo'ai County, Northern Henan, has long had a large gang of drug criminals secretly establishing organizations to manufacture drugs and sell them in Northern Henan and Southern Shanxi. When Liu Zhenhua was stationed in Northern Henan the year before last, there was a crackdown, but it wasn't long before the ashes rekindled, and the organization became even more secretive and widespread. Last winter, Hu Yuwei, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Fourth District, inspected Bo'ai and thoroughly investigated that the drug criminals did have a strict organization, privately possessed many firearms, and dug tunnels to hide and defend themselves, taking the Pinghan and Daoqing lines as sources of drug materials and Southern Shanxi and Northern Henan as sales areas. Their daily business income was often huge, harming the people countless times. The source of scattered bandits in various places is mostly due to the spread of drugs. On the 5th of last month, he went to the province to meet with Chairman Liu, presenting the various situations of the drug criminals and discussing the method of search and seizure. He was instructed to work with Cheng Ziyi, the commander of the Second Security Corps stationed in Jixian in the district, to formulate a detailed plan for suppression. He then sent Wang Rupan, a staff officer from the Security Command, to Cheng's corps to negotiate the suppression method: (1) Corps Commander Cheng will dispatch the Yan and Bi battalions under his command to carry out the suppression in person. (2) First, destroy the manufacturing organizations there, search for key suspects, and then request instructions for long-term stationing after the suppression. (3) Staff Officer Wang Rupan will accompany them to facilitate communication. Chairman Liu approved the telegram. Commissioner Hu sent Staff Officer Wang Rupan to accompany the Second Corps from Jixian on February 18th. After passing through Jiaozuo and arriving at Dazinzhuang, they launched an encirclement. After entering the village, they inquired in detail from the residents and learned that the key criminals who manufactured drugs had already fled upon hearing that the troops had arrived in Jiaozuo. All firearms and some materials had been taken away. Therefore, they guarded the main entrances and exits of the village and conducted a zonal search. In the mosque, the girls' school, and the homes of Shan Wenzhang, Dan Pengxiang, and Dan Guoyan, they found a large number of manufactured drugs and their equipment and materials. They burned down the houses of Shan Wenzhang and Shan Guoxian, and also found cellars. Because Dan Pengxiang's house was adjacent to other civilian houses, they ordered soldiers and villagers to demolish it, and captured more than 40 male and female suspects. According to the confessions of these criminals, half of the residents of the village are Han and half are Hui, and the animosity is very deep. Muslims have been operating drugs for more than ten years. Currently, the manufacturers are Dan Guoxian and Shan Wenzhang, who manage the Zongheji Company, which has a large scale. In addition, Dan Pengxiang, Dan Pengyun, and Dan Guosheng also manufacture drugs under the Shuangshi trademark, which is smaller in scale. The raw materials for drugs all come from Tianjin and Shanghai, transported by train to Bo'ai, and then enter Dazinzhuang for manufacturing. Those made into pills are called red and white pills, and those made into sticks are called Kuaizhongkuai, which are transported and sold in iron boxes or cloth bags, with trademarks and advertisements. They are now gradually being sold in various counties in Northern Henan. A local gentry in Bo'ai County, Li Yulin, is the representative of the manufacturers of drugs in Dazinzhuang. This time, when the troops arrived in Jiaozuo, Li Yulin, upon hearing the news, sent a message to the important drug criminals in the village, who fled early. The non-essential suspects were released, and Shan Pingxin and twelve other suspects, who were deemed necessary to be sent to the province for trial, and two large carts of seized drugs and equipment were sent to the province for interrogation. The important drug criminals at large in the case, Shan Wenzhang, Dan Guosheng, Dan Guoxian, Dan Pengxiang, Dan Pengyun, Li Yulin, etc., were strictly ordered by Commissioner Hu to the county magistrates of Bo'ai and the adjacent Qinyang and Jiyuan counties to quickly arrest them, and strictly ordered all counties under their jurisdiction to cooperate in the arrest. At the same time, they requested the Garrison Pacification Directorate of Henan to issue a general order for strict arrest and to announce the crackdown on the drug manufacturing organizations in Dazinzhuang, Bo'ai, hoping that the public would assist the government in investigating and understanding the whereabouts of the fugitives Shan Wenzhang and others and the location of the firearms, and report them to the county. From now on, it is necessary to implement the Baojia regulations, supervise each other, and report anyone who manufactures or harbors drugs at any time. Those who repent and start anew will not be held responsible for the past. Bo'ai County was also ordered to properly handle the aftermath of the village. Although the key suspects were not all captured in this crackdown on the drug criminals in Dazinzhuang, the long-term hideout has been severely damaged by this heavy blow, and they must deeply know fear. The underground dens, factories, and applied equipment have all been seized and burned, and they cannot continue to secretly manufacture here. The source of drug manufacturing in the nearby counties of Hebei has been cleared, which will be greatly beneficial to cracking down on scattered peddlers and eliminating bandits.</p>

Although the procuratorial authorities are strictly monitoring it, it is difficult to eliminate. Last March, leading figures in financial and political circles initiated the establishment of the Fengtian International Horse Racing Company (headquartered in Kitajima-cho, Nihonbashi-ku). Now, another illegal fraudulent act has been discovered. The Metropolitan Police Department has summoned President Takenaka Inami, Mr. Oki Shinji, and others for questioning and will charge them with breach of trust, embezzlement, and violation of commercial law. It has been found that the company declared that it would give investors the right to win prizes in horse racing and that it would invest in the Dongxing Horse Racing Co., Ltd. of Fengtian. It plans to establish an international racecourse in Fengtian with a capital of 1 million yuan, divided into 50,000 shares, publicly soliciting shares across Japan. It was founded on March 10th of last year, with Mr. Oki Shinji as president, Mr. Onizuka Gundai as managing director, and Mr. Kazuo Oka, a member of the Seiyukai, Mr. Hikoshiro Hada, a member of the Minseito, Mr. Shizuo Sakai, and Mr. Teikichi and others as auditors. Before its establishment, Manchukuo had revoked its rights. However, they still defrauded people abroad, selling more than 13,600 worthless shares for more than 280,000 yuan, involving the company in more than 33,000 yuan and leaving more than 13,000 yuan unrecoverable. In July of last year, Hirooka and Hada resigned, and Mr. Takenaka took over. However, many of the subscribers at the time of establishment did not pay. Takenaka then pretended to have paid in full in the books and embezzled huge expenses. As a result, the company could not recover the loaned money, and the purchased stocks were completely worthless. It then demanded more than 300,000 yuan in damages from the original person in charge. Currently, the Tokyo District Court is sealing the assets of the fraudsters for this matter. This illegal behavior is all borrowing the background of Manchukuo to defraud people.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Comfort Mission Wu Kaixian and Others Return This Morning to Report on the Battle of Gubeikou</h3>
<p>Our troops all have a determination to die</p>
<p>The enemy uses tanks and other equipment to oppress</p>
<p>The Shanghai Comfort Mission to the front-line soldiers, Wu Kaixian and more than ten others, returned to Shanghai this morning. Being anxious to understand the situation at the front, a reporter from the Central News Agency especially visited Wu Kaixian at his private residence. According to him, the Japanese bandits have occupied the three northeastern provinces and are now taking Jehol, threatening North China. Our front-line soldiers, regardless of the ferocity of the Japanese artillery fire, are rushing forward one after another, fighting bravely for the glory of the nation and the personality of the country. How can our people in the rear sit idly by and watch these loyal and courageous soldiers? Therefore, all sectors of the city have generously donated a large number of comfort goods and sent me (Wu said himself) and others to the front to reward the soldiers. After we went north, we first went to Tianjin and then to Qinhuangdao Haiyangzhen, where He Zhuguo's army was stationed. An officer of the army accompanied us to visit the army's position. The army's discipline was strict, and they all had a determination to die. The most pitiful thing is that the trenches they dug had no steel plates to cover them, only the rails dismantled from the Beining Road. However, the army was lying in the trenches without any fear, and they were ready to fight to the death. After we returned from Qinhuangdao, we met the Comfort Missions from Qingdao, Jiaoji Road. We originally planned to go to Gubeikou to comfort Gubeikou, which is about two hundred miles away from Beiping. However, later, because Tang Yulin fled without fighting, the Japanese army chased directly to Gubeikou. The rear support troops were in a hurry to defend, so the traffic on the road was used for marching. We were unable to fulfill our wish. We only visited the wounded soldiers in various hospitals in Beiping. Although the wounded soldiers were suffering from injuries, their hatred of the bandits had not diminished. They all said that once they recovered a little, they would still go to the front to fight the enemy. They all expressed their gratitude to the city's Comfort Mission for coming from thousands of miles away, and they felt ashamed that they had lost famous cities and were not supervised by the society, but instead received comfort. Our Comfort Mission saw their pitiful state and heard their tragic words, and almost shed tears. When I was in Beiping, I met Sun Yanying's senior staff officer, Cui Shuchun. He told me that when Sun's army lost Chengde, it was heavily suppressed by Japanese aircraft and tanks. The supply was cut off, and the weapons were not good. The dangerous situation at that time was beyond description. Fortunately, all the soldiers were able to deeply understand the great righteousness and were not subdued. They still fought their way out and have now made contact with the [illegible] side. According to Cui, the most important supplies that the front line hopes to get from the rear are: (1) anti-aircraft guns (2) flat guns (3) medicines (4) cold clothes. The only things that the Bai army fears are tanks and aircraft. The Japanese army's organization is that each division must have three squadrons of aircraft, about dozens of them. When the Japanese army attacks, it must charge forward with tanks, and the sky is assisted by aircraft carrying out bombing. The ferocity of their bombs is such that even mountains collapse. If our army has anti-aircraft guns, the Japanese aircraft will definitely not be so rampant. As for flat guns, they are used to defend against tanks. Because today, the only things that our army can defend against enemy aircraft and tanks are machine guns. Aircraft are difficult to hit, and although tanks can sometimes be hit, the chances are very small. Because our army has no flat guns, the Japanese army takes advantage of this strength to oppress our army as much as possible. As a result, the casualties of our army are countless. The equipment of the field hospitals at the front is simple, and the medicines are very incomplete, so many wounded soldiers who could have been saved die because there is no medicine to treat them. This is very pitiful. Moreover, because of the severe cold at the front, soldiers lack cotton clothing, which causes them to freeze to death, which is even more tragic. I promised to convey this message to the people in the rear and try to find a way to provide relief. Wu also talked about how transportation in the north is inconvenient and transportation is very difficult. The Japanese army can march hundreds of miles a day, while our army can only march dozens of miles a day. Therefore, the front line should quickly find a way to transport a large number of gasoline. However, the morale of our army is very high. Before I left Beiping, the battle reports all said that it was going smoothly, and the ferocity of the battle was a hundred times greater than the battle in Shanghai. The mission once requested to see Minister He, who has now mobilized reinforcements from all roads. There will definitely be new developments in a few days.</p>
<h3>Shantou Implements Navigation Ban</h3>
<p>Fourteen Hours of Blockade Every Night</p>
<p>Workers Unanimously Reject Japanese Ships</p>
<p>Night Navigation Ban: Shantou Haikou Several days ago, there were rumors that mines had been laid to prohibit ships from traveling and blockading the haikou, etc. This morning, a reporter met with the owner of a Chinese ship who came to Shanghai from Shantou and inquired about the situation. According to him, since the Japanese army launched its attack on Jehol, Chen Jitang has attached importance to the defense of the southwest coast. Chen inspected the garrison in Shantou last Thursday and immediately ordered martial law in Shantou's coastal defense. From that day on, all civilian ships and merchant ships entering and leaving Shantou haikou could only do so during the day, from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. These ten hours are the open navigation time. After this prescribed time, passage is prohibited. The prohibited navigation time is also prescribed from 5:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning. This fourteen-hour period is the prohibited night navigation time. Currently, most ships arriving in Shantou enter the port during the day, and the port has not laid mines because ships can still sail freely. If mines are laid, the navy must guide them.</p>
<p>Rejecting Japanese Ships: In Shantou and Guangdong, the boycott of Japanese ships has become more intense recently. Not only do dock workers in Shantou and Guangdong refuse to unload goods when Japanese ships arrive, but sampans also refuse to carry crew members and passengers. Now, in the section of Guangzhou port to Baietan, merchant ships must use a pilot to guide them before they can enter the port. Now, Guangdong pilots have unanimously refused to pilot Japanese ships, making it impossible for Japanese ships to enter Guangdong. However, it has been heard that when Japanese ships arrive in Guangdong, they follow foreign ships into the port and bring Taiwanese workers to Guangdong to load and unload goods themselves.</p>

<h3>Northeast Association Urges Government to Quickly Counterattack Jehol</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Deployment Not Ready, Recapturing Chengde is Possible</p>
<p>The Spring Thaw in the Northeast Should Prompt the Mobilization of Volunteer Armies</p>
<p>Mr. [illegible] Qifang, former mayor of Tianjin and director-general of the Northeast Association, told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency this morning that the Northeast Association is engaged in contacting various groups to urge the armies in North China to counterattack and mobilize the volunteer armies within the three northeastern provinces. The solicitation of members and the organization of branches are still in preparation.</p>
<p>Urging a Counterattack: Recently, the fighting at various passes along the Great Wall has been fierce. Although the government has expressed its determination to resist, we must not think that resistance is enough. We must strive to counterattack to be successful. According to Mr. [illegible], the Japanese military deployment within Jehol province is not yet ready. It is very possible for our army to recapture Chengde if it tries hard. This is because there are still Sun Dianying's troops and volunteer armies in northern Chengde. If Chengde is recaptured in one fell swoop, it will have a significant impact on the international diplomatic situation and the people's anti-Japanese sentiment and support for the government. Therefore, the Association is now contacting various groups in Shanghai to unanimously urge the government to launch a counterattack quickly.</p>
<p>Mobilizing the Volunteer Armies: There are still more than 200,000 people in the volunteer armies hidden in the three northeastern provinces. Recently, the northern Manchuria region has begun to thaw, and the roads are muddy. The Japanese army is finding it very difficult to transport heavy artillery and equipment. It is more convenient for us to fight and to contain the Japanese army invading Jehol. We must rely on the mobilization of the volunteer armies within the three provinces.</p>
<h3>Yu Fengzhi's Special Train Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A special train was used because there was too much luggage</p>
<p>Zhang will stay for a few days and then go abroad</p>
<p>Madam Yu Fengzhi, wife of Zhang Xueliang, and five others, including her sons and daughters, and aide-de-camp Zhang Jiabao, arrived in Nanjing by special train last night from Tianjin-Pukou, carrying a large amount of luggage. It was originally planned to take the night train to Shanghai last night, but because there was too much luggage, they were unable to catch the Beijing-Shanghai night train and changed to a special train to Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai at around 6:00 PM today. It is heard that Zhang Xueliang will stay for a few days after Yu [illegible] and then go abroad.</p>
<h3>The Strangest and Most Intriguing Case of Youth Enticement</h3>
<p>Encountering a Bored Conman Near a Fortune Telling Stall</p>
<p>A Red Car Used as a Means of Transportation</p>
<p>A Copper Coin with a Hidden Cross Imprint</p>
<p>The Conman Favors Using it as a Secret Code; The Truth is Investigated</p>
<p>Recently, among the unemployed lingering around Zhejiang Road for the past ten days or so, their long, disheveled hair has all been cut into buzz cuts. Barbers, encountering these youths, all perform the same action, which is quite strange. There is a twelve-year-old Ningbo native named Wu Chengen, formerly residing at 348 Tiantong'an Road. Since the Shanghai battle, his house was burned down, leaving him homeless and jobless. He spends his days wandering the streets, living a vagrant life. Around 8:00 AM on the 7th of this month, at a fortune telling stall at the New Garbage Bridge embankment, he was divining to see if his fortunes would ever turn for the better. Suddenly, a man claiming to be surnamed Wang approached and said, "If you're looking for a job, now is your chance. A chocolate factory on Jingfeng Road in western Shanghai is hiring workers, paying six yuan per week. Why not come with me?" Wu thought it was a good opportunity and happily agreed. Unexpectedly, the man then said that the factory requires workers to have no facial hair and no long hair, so he should quickly go to a barber to get his hair cut. Since he only had nine copper coins left, Wang gave him eleven more copper coins and told him to get his hair cut. After he finished getting his hair cut, Wang further said, "I cannot accompany you. Wait at the entrance of Sincere Company on Zhejiang Road. When a red car comes, call out the code 'Zhaofeng,' and you can get into the car, which will take you to the factory to get a work permit and start working." Wu followed his instructions and waited at the designated location. In less than half an hour, a red car came from the west. Wang was also sitting in the car. Because Wu thought the whole thing was strange and because it was cold and windy, he stood at the entrance of the alley across the road. When the red car came, he did not step forward to greet it. At this time, Wang, having not achieved his objective, also took the original car and went east. Wu thought this was suspicious and reported the situation to the police station. Tang Rongzhang at the police station had already reported a similar situation. He was instructed that if he saw the man again, he should report it immediately. Yesterday morning, Wu encountered this person again at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Xiamen Road. He stepped forward to ask about the job. The man replied that the factory was full and there was nothing he could do, and gave him two dimes for bus fare. Wu immediately reported to Huabu 1285, who arrested him and took him to the police station. The man confessed his real name was Lu Wenbin, from Pudong, and he worked as a tailor, residing at 53 Juxing Lane, Xinzha Road. A strange copper coin was found on his person. This copper coin was made from a Qing Dynasty copper coin. One side was modified by a machine to press a very deep horizontal line, and the other side was pressed with a vertical line. After repeated viewing, it formed a cross. According to the police station, during the emergency of the January 28th incident last year, traitors often used it as a secret code. This morning at 9:00 AM, the police station took Lu to the First District Court for trial, presided over by Judge Feng Shide. The police lawyer, Ru Baozhang, presented the case and sent detectives to inquire at the tailor shop on Xinzha Road. Seven or eight tailors replied that they did not know him, but a woman upstairs said he was her brother and that he usually made clothes upstairs, so the tailors downstairs would not recognize him. Lawyer Ru further stated that the defendant's actions of enticing ignorant youths were strange. The police wanted to investigate the facts to determine which criminal law the defendant had violated and requested temporary detention. The judge ordered a week's delay for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Yunfei Car Hits Four People in a Row</h3>
<p>Driving at Full Speed in a Remote Area</p>
<p>Looking Flustered After Causing the Accident</p>
<p>Around 8:00 AM this morning, a Yunfei car rental company vehicle with license plate number 12394 was traveling on Huanlong Road in the French Concession. When it reached the intersection of Huade Road and Dalianwan Road, because the area was remote and there were few pedestrians, the driver accelerated and sped past, hitting Dai Laoba (Jiangbei native, 36 years old, waiter), injuring his head. Tian Xinwen (Jiangbei native, 30 years old, worker at a self-igniting fire company) had a broken rib. The driver, seeing the accident, looked flustered and hurriedly drove away to escape, accidentally running over Liu Jinshou (Jiangbei native, 26 years old), injuring his leg, and a child, Ni Hetang (12 years old, residing at 7 Qianxin Lane, Huade Road), injuring his abdomen. Two Chinese police officers, numbers 2726 and 1262, arrived, recorded the car number, and quickly sent the four injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Second Resignation Approved</h3>
<p>— A Young Man</p>
<p>In the past few days, the most heated news in the newspapers, besides the Northeast Volunteer Army desperately fighting the enemy and Sun Dianying's isolated resistance, is the eye-catching headline about our late Grand Marshal Zhang's brilliant son, the former Commander of the Northeast Border Defense and current Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters and acting member of the Peiping Military Branch, Marshal Zhang Hanqing's resignation! The reason for this resignation, it is said, is that Chairman Tang Yulin of Jehol actually practiced "non-resistance" in Jehol, but unfortunately failed to master the true essence, leading to the loss of Jehol. Chairman Tang disappeared, and the Marshal, in anger, issued a telegram advocating for Chairman Tang to be captured and beheaded to vent his anger. However, the Central Supervisory Yuan refused to be magnanimous and grant special leniency and wanted to propose impeachment. Fortunately, our Marshal Zhang could see through things and didn't bother to argue with them (otherwise, there would be another resignation of the head of the Supervisory Yuan, a trip to Germany, and our Marshal would have another appointment as XX Branch Committee member! But then, wouldn't that be wonderful?). He generously took the initiative to resign to the central government, and the central government readily agreed to "approve the resignation" (remember, this is the second time "approved"! The first time was on August 16th of the 21st year of the Republic!). Therefore, Marshal Zhang hurriedly issued a telegram announcing his resignation, hurriedly handled the handover, and hurried to Shanghai on his own Ford plane to prepare to go abroad; the central government hurriedly sent a senior official to take over, hurriedly arranged military projects for defense, offense, and recovery of lost territories, and hurriedly... In short, in this way, the whole country was busy.</p>
<p>Frivolous, inexperienced young people were overjoyed, applauding and shedding tears, saying, "If this egg isn't smoothed out, Tianjin and Peiping will inevitably not be safe, and Beijing and Shanghai will gradually suffer... Now, I sincerely hope that this departure will be forever, never to return!" Deep, worldly old people sighed and smiled, saying, "Originally, this child was too stubborn! He doesn't listen to elders, how can he not fail? He shouldn't have, shouldn't have, shouldn't have created a 'non-resistance' policy and insisted on implementing it himself. Otherwise, if he had honestly retreated earlier, our government would have had a way, and wouldn't our bright national flag with a blue sky, white sun, and red earth still be proudly waving in the head of Shenyang? Wouldn't the Three Principles of the People textbooks still be popular and selling well in the major bookstores of 'Manchuria'?... Actually, that's how I think, 'In a nutshell, Marshal Zhang's ability to yield the position in times of difficulty (difficulty, not national crisis) is, after all, remarkable and worthy of praise, and he remains a gentleman of the nation!' We should think about it again and again."</p>
<p>Go, Marshal Zhang! Please don't dwell on the fact that we all belong to the Yin dynasty (please refer to Marshal's resignation telegram). Our government has already made proper arrangements and announced the plan for the aftermath of North China in the newspapers. As for us, the small people who deserve to die ten thousand times, we will certainly continue to assist your subordinates, because we have been assisting them for more than twenty years and will never abandon our reputation and break our promise! Marshal, please rest assured. Go, Marshal! I wish you calm seas and smooth sailing in the ocean so that you can play golf on the deck to entertain yourself and dispel your loneliness! And, I humbly ask you to cherish yourself. I won't say more.</p>

<h3>Recent Writings of Mr. Duan Zhiquan</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Since resigning as Chief Executive, Mr. Duan Qirui of Hefei has converted to Buddhism and enjoys playing chess and writing poetry, generally using secretaries to write for him. Recently, due to the passing of his teacher, the elder Mr. Huang Shiqing of Shucheng, he felt the need to commemorate his teaching of scriptures and the expounding of great righteousness, drawing from a hundred schools of thought to integrate into military strategy, encompassing all things, and especially emphasizing the lessons of upholding righteousness and understanding shame. After fifty years of eulogies, he respectfully copied them and sent them to fulfill the duties of a disciple. The eulogy reads:</p>
<p>In the past, listening to the discussion of scriptures, thoroughly elucidating the great righteousness, we all looked forward to practicing the Way, sufficient to rectify the world. 운丁阳九, 竟无所济, 退而独善·聊葆幽, 觥觥气象, 宛似壮岁, 宜式乡国, 傅之无旣.</p>

<h3>The Physiological Impact of Vegetarianism on the Human Body</h3>
<p>— Tianying</p>
<p>In the past, "vegetarianism" did not attract much attention and was often dismissed as a religious precept, having no impact on our body's nutrition. With the daily progress of science, vegetarianism, from a scientific viewpoint, has proven to have considerable advantages. Therefore, it is not only experiencing new development in our country but also gaining popularity in Europe and America. The Germans, famous for their robust physique and military-national education, often have a fondness for vegetarianism, but they practice it scientifically, not prohibiting nutritious foods like milk and eggs. Now, let's examine the two most important benefits of vegetarianism:</p>
<p>(1) Vegetarianism can cleanse the stomach and intestines and increase appetite (of course, digestion is strengthened, which is why appetite can increase).</p>
<p>Many of the foods we eat are digested and transformed into nutrients that seep into the bloodstream; few remain undigested and become waste. Vegetarian diets use plant-based oils (such as soybean oil, vegetable oil, etc.) to replace lard (animal fats) for cooking, so they do not have the same characteristics of clogging the stomach and intestines as lard. Look! People who eat a lot of lard certainly have poor appetites (unless they eat more lard with their meals). Isn't this a very obvious example?</p>
<p>(2) Vegetarianism can naturally regulate the physiological impulses of sexual desire. Doesn't this sound strange at first? It's important to know that the impulses of sexual desire are often caused by the stimulating phenomena produced by hormones secreted by the sexual organs. Substances that promote the growth of these substances are actually more numerous than substances that can suppress sexual desire. Especially in mammals that are close to humans, their meat and fat contain many secretions that promote stimulation. Consider the vegetarianism of monks and nuns, although it is a sincere precept in Buddhism, but the Buddha who created this precept would certainly not have said this out of thin air. It can be seen that vegetarianism does have a considerable relationship with abstinence. Some people want to find a suitable method to naturally reduce the impulses of sexual desire and have tried various actions (not dressing too warmly, exercising during the day, etc.), but have never achieved a satisfactory result. In his unintentional, due to environmental reasons, not eating fish and meat, after two months, he actually achieved his goal. Although we cannot say that vegetarianism is the only effective method of abstinence, there is no doubt that vegetarianism can reduce</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>sexual impulses.</p>
<p>As to why vegetarianism can restrain sexual desire? To date not completely understood. Is a problem to be resolved. However, according to the observation of chemical composition, vegetable dishes, the content of sugar, starch, a small amount of oil and light compounds, containing other secretions is very small. Unlike fish and meat contain more stimulating secretions, so that will not excite sexual desire</p>
<p>The author does not advocate abstinence, but in fact tells us that too frequent sexual impulses are useless and harmful to the health of the body, so whether young, adult, whether married, unmarried, whether or not to marry, have the need to practice abstinence, and that asking for food can be abstinence, it seems that in addition to the previously advocated method, to open another small road</p>
<h3>Living Sufferings</h3>
<p>Shop Clerk Communication</p>
<h3>Denying Stock Ownership</h3>
<p>Editor Sir</p>
<p>Since the birth of your newspaper's shop clerk communication column, answering difficult questions, we have directly and indirectly gained a lot of knowledge, which is really a great blessing! Now I have a difficult problem, please give me instructions</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Cai, frugal, finally saved two thousand yuan ·· In the twentieth year of the Republic, he partnered with XX silk and satin shop on Nanjing Road. Because the number is too small, it is attached to the name of the manager of the number, as half a share. Mr. Cai and the manager have always had friendship, so he did not obtain shares at that time. In the past few years, the business of the shop has been very good ·· Mr. Cai has also been able to work in the shop with peace of mind. Unexpectedly, good things are more grinding, last year, both sides had quarrels, so this spring the manager removed Mr. Cai, so a family of five, the life suddenly lost security, now intends to put forward their own capital of two thousand yuan, another way to make a living. Unexpectedly, the manager refused completely, denying that Mr. Cai was a shareholder of the store; both sides could not avoid arguing, and the feelings became worse, and have become a stalemate. Yesterday Mr. Cai moved to my residence to ask me for advice ·· I am only shallowly educated, and can not respond to this special matter to the end of the beginning and end, inform the gentleman, may I ask</p>
<p>(1) May Mr. Cai sue in court?</p>
<p>(2) Because there is no stock list, is the future favorable?</p>
<p>(3) May the bonus be claimed?</p>
<p>I think that the gentleman is talented and capable, and can give a beautiful and satisfactory answer. Special thanks to</p>
<p>An Wang Wen Da Jin Shang Editor's Note ·· Mr. Cai, because of the manager, has always been good at suddenly frugality, the accumulation of years of savings, to the person, and does not obtain any evidence, it is too careless. The capital of the store, in name, two thousand yuan is only half a share, of course, not small; but for a shareholder who only invests half a share, it is allowed to enjoy the benefits of accounting, it is obvious that the content is not very substantial, Mr. Cai at that time, can not help but consider, at least the formalities, it seems that can not be slightly sloppy. Now the law of our country, focusing on evidence, is really a bit difficult. However, the so-called evidence in law is not limited to the contract of signing the flower and writing the mortgage. Suppose Mr. Cai paid the money. There is a manager receipt or even a return receipt, or the number of capital accounts the same, there is a record of this matter. No matter the receipt, the return receipt and the book, only need to have one in this, you can use it as material evidence, on which to sue and pursue. Even if the above-mentioned material evidence can not be submitted; that nobody evidence is also OK. For example, at the time of delivery, or there are friends in the field, etc. can ·· But in the end not as powerful as material evidence ear. I think two thousand yuan, the number can not be said to be small, will never be privately given and received all the end has credentials. So Mr. Cai should now collect evidence, and then sue, with considerable documents, winning the case is not difficult. However, some of these evidences can only prove that there is this sum of money, but can not prove that it is a share. We hope that the documents found by Mr. Cai, not only can prove that there is this sum of money, and can also prove that it is capital; because in this way, in order to demand the return of capital, and can also pursue dividends. If unfortunately. The evidence found, can only prove that there is this sum of money, and can not prove that it capital, the unpaid dividend is really some can not start to speak. Under these circumstances, Mr. Cai can only demand the return of this two thousand yuan of silver and the interest calculated at the rate of four percent for many years. Because the law stipulates that if the loan is not specified the rate of interest, the general interest rate is calculated at four percent per annum. As for your job problem, in human terms, of course he should not withdraw your job, but the law is not. You have not received a share list, of course, the share list will not stipulate that 'you have the right to serve as a secretary.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Film Education Movements in Various Countries (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Wan</p>
<p>Currently, countries around the world are promoting the film industry with utmost effort. While they have not yet treated films as formal teaching tools in schools, they have already adopted films as supplementary educational tools. Each school utilizes evenings or holidays to screen films at least several to dozens of times each year. In terms of public education, they go a step further, recognizing films as textbooks for the public, and movie theaters as public schools. They meticulously research the promotion and dissemination, censorship and improvement of films, striving to achieve perfection in order to arouse public delight and interest. On one hand, they seek ways to subsidize the film industry and provide it with various conveniences. As a result, film entertainment has become the leading form of public entertainment in today's world. The American film industry is the most developed, with over 20,500 movie theaters nationwide. Germany is second, with approximately 5,100 theaters. The United Kingdom is next, with approximately 4,400 theaters. Other countries such as France with approximately 3,800 theaters, Italy with approximately 2,200 theaters, Soviet Russia with approximately 1,100 theaters, and Japan with approximately 2,000 theaters, are also highly developed. However, the number of movie theaters is related to a country's area, population, and urban economy. Although Soviet Russia has a large land area, its cities are few. Although Japan has a dense population, its territory is not vast. Therefore, the number of movie theaters in both countries is relatively low. According to a recent survey, China has 135 movie theaters, and it can be confidently stated that the number will increase in the future. The film education movement in various countries can be divided into two types: active and passive. The passive approach involves establishing various censorship systems and strictly reviewing and censoring films produced by private entities. The active approach involves promoting the production of wholesome educational films for use in social and school education.</p>
<p>Among the film education movements in various countries, each has its own characteristics and policies. For example, the United States emphasizes the production of aviation, sports, art, and social films. Germany emphasizes the production of academic films. Soviet Russia and Italy emphasize the production of ideological propaganda and cultural films. Each country has specially established film education institutions. Some of the more famous ones include the National Film Review Board of the United States, the National Bureau of Film Education for Young People, the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the National Institute for Cultural and Educational Film Production of Soviet Russia, the National Film Association of Italy (LUCE), and the All-Japan Film Education Research Association of Japan. In addition, the League of Nations has also established the International Educational Cinematographic Institute to study and implement the internationalization of film education.</p>
<p>Now, let's first discuss the film education movement in the Soviet Union. Lenin once said, "Among all forms of artistic expression, film is the most valuable." Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that film is the most important weapon for propagating ideology and building a new society. They specially established the National Institute for Cultural and Educational Film Production, employing university professors and specialists as supervisors to engage in scientific research in order to promote national policy. They also contacted film enthusiasts throughout the country and organized the Soviet Film Comrades Association, establishing branches in various regions. Whether they are staff of various agencies, students, laborers, or Red Guards, all can join. Currently, there are over 35,000 members and 400 branches. They are engaged in the study of the film industry, the writing of screenplays, the exclusion of inferior films, the publication of film magazines, and the coordination of mobile screening teams to screen films in the rural areas of the interior in order to develop inland culture. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Texas Bad Man"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>In the current film industry, which has completely become a capitalist mode of production, many stars who are praised by the audience are exploited by film industrialists and become organic production tools. Thus, these stars cry and laugh aimlessly in front of the camera, and Tom Mix, skilled in riding and shooting, repeatedly runs and jumps, unable to cry out in pain even if he breaks his scalp.</p>
<p>Thus, what Tom Mix must do in "The Texas Bad Man" is his riding and shooting, and the reason why "The Texas Bad Man" becomes a film is because there is such a star who can ride and shoot. Therefore, the writing of the story and the direction of the performance are all to suit this one star.</p>
<p>In this film, Tom Mix plays a police officer with amazing martial arts skills. In order to capture a bandit leader, he disguises himself as a bandit and goes deep into the bandit's lair. Later, he falls in love with the bandit leader's sister and does not want to harm his beloved's brother, the bandit leader. However, in the end, he kills him due to a temporary misunderstanding. Of course, Tom Mix is as energetic and unique as always in this process. Among the supporting roles, the one who plays the bandit leader is relatively better, able to change his personality when disguised as a merchant, making the audience unaware that this merchant is the self-proclaimed Napoleon bandit leader, which is commendable. The rest of the cast are just perfunctory. The structure of the play is very fragmented, making it difficult for general audiences who are not proficient in English to grasp a clear system. Especially the ending is mediocre and tasteless, but the director's skills are quite good, and the overall atmosphere is very tense. Some of the night scene shots are relatively good because the lighting is well used. However, detective or martial arts films are best suited for using night scenes, because this can make people feel fear.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, a story like this would be more touching if performed as a silent film. Even the dialogue in this film does not occupy a very important position.</p>
<h3>Foreword to "Flower Butterfly"</h3>
<p>— Zhen Zhen</p>
<p>"Flower Butterfly" is not a Peking opera, it is a film, it is a French new film. The twentieth century is an era of rampant human desires, especially in France, especially in the luxurious Paris. The charming women and intoxicating wines there will fascinate generally weak-willed young people. "Flower Butterfly" is a microcosm of such figures in this era. The story is like this:</p>
<p>A wandering young man accidentally meets a drifting singer, and the two hit it off and live together. Later, the young man becomes famous, and the upper class of society worship him. Especially those social butterflies and celebrities are desperately in love with him. He cannot resist the temptation of these figures and indulges in wine and women day and night. As a result, his fame also passes like flowing water with time, and those social butterflies who were madly in love with him have now changed to worshiping another figure. Only the singer who met him in times of adversity still comes to comfort him.</p>
<p>This play, in terms of performance and lens reality, shows the innovative style of France, and the beauty of Garbo is even more unprecedented since there were French films. It is said that it will be released in Paris soon.</p>
<h3>Tennis Ace Cochet to Appear on Screen</h3>
<p>— Zhao Peng</p>
<p>French grass tennis star Henri Cochet, who has repeatedly maintained the Davis Cup title and performs with excellent momentum, has recently been allowed by the French Tennis Association to take on filming at the Monte Carlo City Club, demonstrating various postures of his hitting. It is expected that it will begin filming shortly, and it is expected that Cochet's good skills will be seen on the screen in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>The Art of Kissing</h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Kissing, as everyone knows, is a performance of love. In romance-like films on the screen, there is always a kissing scene in the middle. However, drama is drama, and kissing must come from emotions from the heart to be touching. Therefore, kissing on film is bound to be rigid and not a true expression, but the actors practice kissing very carefully and are able to meet the artistic conditions. Now, let's analyze the various kissing postures of the actors: When Clark Gable kisses, his eyes are half-closed and his throat moves up and down. He and Norma Shearer are very touching when they perform kissing. According to Clark himself, the most realistic kiss he has felt since appearing on the screen is with Carole Lombard, and he does not dare to be too presumptuous with Norma Shearer, so it is not very real. Jean Harlow and Chester Morris's kiss in "Red-Headed Woman" is weak. Because kissing is very exciting, a weak kiss is forced.</p>
