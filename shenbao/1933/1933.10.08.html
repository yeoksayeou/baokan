<h3>爲棉業統制進解</h3>
<p>— 實</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會成立之初。最注意之點即在於棉業　制故棉業統制委員會。不日即行成立。據棉業統制委員會某負責人表示。謂今後將集注全力於陜西河南河北。山西。等省之棉花生産。並振興水利。改善種植務使本國産棉各區。得蒸蒸日益向上。而對於棉花市場。應如何具體規劃則尚未有所表示。惟吾人以爲欲言統制。决不能單獨統制生産而不注意於消費市場况美國棉麥借欵。以棉花爲大宗。是消費市塲之亟應注意。更無疑義至於集中全國經濟力量。統籌整個國民經濟之出路。使今日衰頽萎縮之市面得向上繁榮一般徘徊於饑餓線上之羣衆。亦得安於其業。人工剌激之景氣始不至落空。此又言統制經濟者最切實有效之方法也。</p>
<p>我國歡迎國際聯盟技術合作。擴大經濟委員會組織。其於經濟建設之目標。自非限於某一産業部門。或注意某一部分之繁榮也。我國産業之主要部門。以紡織工業爲第一。而紡織工業原料之來源。首在棉花棉業之應首覓出路。誠爲確切不移之事實。不過棉業統制就生産方面言。其主要根源在農村就消費方面言。其唯一去路爲紗廠。目前農村疲敝。生機幾乎盡絶紗廠减工前途亦殊危殆。其有待於設法挽救可知今棉業統制委員會旣注意於棉花生産。倘更能進而注意於消費之途逕。則棉業前途。不難放一異彩吾再進而爲紡紗業方面計。</p>
<p>後進工業國家。其最先發達者在輕工業方面不獨我國爲然即日本亦然所不同者。我國紡紗廠之進展。在歐戰期中。乘勢而起。其情有類乎投機發展雖速。而産業之根基。殊未穩固。倘在世界經濟每榮時期。與本國市塲銷路暢旺之際。金融界旣放心放欵。産業組織次　擴張。一般社會亦有餘力以事消費則此種實際的好市面自可掩過投機之危險然而我國産業原極幼穉投機　能取得暫時之紙面興旺。而内容空虛。反有害於前途之發達據深知我國紗業内幕者之調查通全國各紗廠能實事求是努力於産業之進展者僅三五廠　而已大多數以全力從事於投機運動。而忽視其本業。致一旦恐慌襲來。市場衰落。窘狀即將立見。甚至無法維持。全中國華人資本所建紗廠紡錠計約二百五十餘萬。值此棉紗銷路阻滯。農村經濟頽敗之秋設再無法挽救。前途不甚危險乎。</p>
<p>其次。我國紡紗廠。就各廠單獨觀察。似尙可觀。若就整個紡紗業狀况而論則覺漫無　織。雖有紗業聯合會之組織。未能健全。事實上並不能發揮其團體行動之力量。如以日本人在華所設之紗廠相比較。即顯見日人行動之一致。開拓販賣市塲之手段敏活。運用資本之方法奇巧。故在此同一地域之内論人工。論原料。本國廠家皆應有優先之便利。而結果乃得其反蓋中國紗廠之經營者。旣未能切實團結。而又不識本國市塲之需要。爲此區區二百五十餘萬紡錠之産品尋求出路。此所以難於維持而日即於崩潰也。</p>
<p>長此以往。如再無切於實際之辦法。恐紗業全體。將不免步絲業之後塵而陷於殭化。倘至此時雖有政府後盾。雖能行使統制。　前途亦不易樂觀故欲救目前之急。除未來之患。則紗業統制。應與棉業統制同時並施必先根本剔除投機之弊。打破不團結之習。集中精力於紗業。之經營深切認識農村之需求夫然後乃可期棉業之發達也。</p>
<h3>中東路形勢險惡　　俄僞决裂在卽　哈埠商業停頓</h3>
<p>（哈爾濱）此問間各界漸信俄滿雙方現陸續趨向破裂之途、因中東路俄員之被拘留、已引起嚴重發展也、俄總領事史拉伏資基昨至此間交涉局提出第四次抗議、反對滿當局之詎絶釋放俄員、交涉員施履本當場拒絶此項抗議、仍以拘留路員、僅屬司法問題爲言、俄總領則不以此說爲然、要求將其抗議轉達長春、但施履本始終不變其態度、爭論三小時、俄總領起立言曰、余欲君將余抗議告知長春、施答曰、此非不可能、但此問題究屬司法、而非政治云、此間銀行不允貼現收受匯票與期票、而各界又有俄滿或終决裂之預料、故哈爾濱商業現頗不佳、一般意見以爲目前情勢斷難持久、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>澳洲排斥日貨</h3>
<p>（東京）英澳特惠稅則、對於八百三十九種貨物减稅百分之一二·五、而對於日貨則徵收傾銷稅、日本外務省因此已訓令駐澳洲雪梨之日總領事村井、向澳政府提出抗議、以日貨與英貨相較、將受兩重不利爲理由、並說明日本每年向澳洲購入價值日幣一萬三千四百萬元之貨物、而澳洲則僅購進價值三千七百萬元之日貨、兩相比較、澳洲對日出超約及一萬萬元、故日本乃澳洲之最好主顧、如澳洲以下正當壓力加諸日貨、則日本不得已將採取方法、以應付因此而起之新局勢云、抗議文並將言及日本實業界現有擬向南美南非等處採購羊毛之運動、謂若澳洲相迫過甚、則定有不幸結果、因日本紡績業對於排斥日貨之澳洲、終將停購其羊毛也云、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>廣田雖繼内田　外交政策並不變更　荒木對日記者之談話　山本内相贊助高橋立場</h3>
<p>字都宫　荒木陸相七日上午到宇都宫、視察第十四師團留守部隊後、赴衛戍病院慰問滿洲事變傷兵、下午出席國防恊會、演說時局問題、陸相對記者曰、五相會議前途尚多困難、陸軍演習期前、能否决定國策、未能豫測、世間相信、廣田外相高橋藏相與軍部、關於國策問題、意見衝突、然决定國策、彼此討論爲普通之事、廣田君雖繼内田君就任外相、然日本對中俄美各外交政策、决不爲之更變、日本對外方針、自承認［滿洲國］退出國聯後、已經决定、余對藏相述言之國策、與五相會議之關係、未便宣布、但五相會議之前途及其經過甚重要、美國擴張海軍、因此日美關係被人認爲尖銳化、世間期待廣田外相之緩和策、然認識對手眞實態度爲最爲、日俄之間、又復發生不侵犯條約問題、亦未可知、然此與中東路問題、漁業問題等相同、不過係枝節問題、俄方在國境集中兵力、故非由其撤廢軍備、不能談不侵犯條約問題、至中國問題、决不能因廣田就外相、急謀中日親善、余信國内一致團結、則毫無恐懼對外問題之必要（七日日聯電）</p>
<p>廣田外交政策</p>
<p>（東京）政府於三日閣議散會及六日閣議之後、特如集大藏·外務·陸海軍等五大臣會議、恊議打開非常時局之最高國策樹立問題、廣田外相說明外交政策、與荒木陸相大角海相之間討論對俄對美政策之樹立問題、外相主張之外交政策内容如下</p>
<p>（一）一般外交之根本方針、與軍事合併實行、而以確立日本在遠東自主的立塲之方針、與列國交涉外交、</p>
<p>（二）對俄政策、日本採用解决兩國問各種懸案之方針、但因蘇俄國家有特别性、力避訂立不侵犯特殊條約、及其他形式之條約、以束縛兩主立塲、</p>
<p>（三）對華政策、中日關係之現狀、在表面無大進步、主張中日直接交涉等見解、對於中日關係之現狀有害無益、對華政策亦先行解决當面之諸懸案、而漸次到達打開全體局面之地步、</p>
<p>（四）對美政策、日美關係、因一九三五年之二次華盛頓會議開會在即、頗有緊張之情勢、對美政策、須緩和如此急迫之空氣、而與美政府開始政治的交涉、實現太平洋和平保障恊定、以爲平穩通過一九三五年之基礎的工作、又日美兩國交換國民的使節、以計兩國民感情之剅融和、</p>
<p>外相此項外交政策、如得五相會議之承認、則擬上奏日皇、並報告西園寺公、（七日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日本政局緊張</h3>
<p>（東京）五相會議、以各部門之國策决定、爲討論之主題、第一次第二次會議之結果、各閣員對於現狀認識、意見有非常之懸隔、因此未能進行審議、五相會議若循此以往、則預算之編成、將遭遇非常之難局、政局或將發生重大影響、亦未可知、（七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）昨日五相會議、關係國防工作問題、意見未能一致、留待下次會議、高橋藏相對軍部方面之充實軍備意見、所主張之和平工作意見、已漸明確討論、蓋高橋藏相從國防充實之一班、求之軍備、同時其他之一班、有待外相和平工作之見地、故反對增稅論、是會議已涉問題之核心、來週星期二之下次會議、高橋藏相之和平意見、與軍部之軍備充實意見、是否能見妥恊點、極堪注目、（七日日聯電）</p>
<h3>高橋荒木談話</h3>
<p>（東京）昨日五相會議後、高橋藏相語記者曰、會議内容恕難發表、惟五相會議、今後將續開數次、余因健康關係、本希望分别會見、竟未如願、殊爲遺憾、會議主題、在於外交、然外交並非喧擾所能奏事、須先以外交爲第一、然後順應外交、樹立國防計畫、余意會議之中心、在明年度預算問題以前、恐難有進展、又荒木陸相語記者曰、此後日本究向何處進展、日本究將如何建設、認爲有討論之必要、故開五相會議、然對認識爲國策基礎之現狀、意見各不相同、故無進展、今秋大操以前、恐難就緒、一九三六年第二次華府會議、如通告海軍軍縮條約之廢棄、則此時爲應决定方針之時期、至國防預算、海陸軍均有獨自之立場編成之、（七日電通電）</p>
<h3>山本贊助高橋</h3>
<p>（東京）山本内相七日赴長野新瀉兩縣、視察地方行政、内相在車中談曰、陸海軍省對於明年度預算、以抱强硬意見、國防雖重要、然剌戟外國等事、須要避免、軍事費部題、現由五相會議討論中、軍事當局、决無不考慮財政狀態、而要求軍事費之事、故預料本問題可達圓滿解决、（七日日聯電）</p>

<h3>德國態度未變　軍縮將歸失敗歟　德覆文堅持軍備平等　舊協約國須立卽裁軍</h3>
<p>（日央瓦）　此間今夜聞悉德國已通知英·法·意·美、苟能允德人完全軍備平等、則將接受監督軍備計劃、但無論如何、不能接受美國提議之試騐藍督期、而要求永久辦法、據聞德政府之意、對於允其最後達於軍備平等或其他條件、均不能滿意、如欲其接受監督計劃、則將要求立時平等、其牒文係於今夜送交美·英·法·意·四國代表、亦曾鄭重申言廢除侵略武器之必要、但聞其措辭之方式、竟令此間對於軍縮　議前途、意見頓殊、有數國代表聲稱、法國必不能全予接受、雖主幹委員會將盡力調和各方意見、但料德國之態度、勢將令軍縮會議歸於失敗、蓋照德國牒文中措辭、舊恊約國須立即開始裁减軍備、而同時德國或將堅持鞏固其軍事地位云、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>大風潮將實現</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國某要員今日宣稱、德國不能接受安分軍縮之時期、該員並徵實備敦德代辦俾士麥曾赴英外交部解釋德政府態度之說、現悉德國對於軍縮所已發生異見之主要問題、態度依然未變、德國對戰品問題、堅持其要求、且仍拒絶以四年爲過渡時期、試騐監管軍備之新制、在此時期中、仍維持目前電備之不平等、而不稍加變更之計畫、德國主張一俟軍縮公約訂成、當以今日軍備雄厚諸國所謂［自衛或器］之各類供給德國、各國固允將來軍縮以存留此類武器爲限也、德國不因時事之變化而有所惶慮、其政界與報界皆謂大風潮行將實行、但德國實不負厥責云、彼等又切實聲明德國不欲動置軍備、但其他各國如拒絶軍縮、則德國必須享有平等權利也、今日德國所予英國之解釋、乃英國曾向德國有所詢問、而德國依以逐條答覆者、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）兹悉德國除請縮短軍縮試騐時期外、且要求實質之軍縮應在試騐時期未終止前開始實行、德國又請將烈强所凖備軍縮之確切程度詳告之、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國大爲不悅</h3>
<p>（倫敦）法國因德國不先通告法意兩國、而與英國交換關於軍縮之竟見、殊爲不懌、德國提出之計畫、恐將因此稍受不利之影響、駐倫敦德代辦曾將德國對近今列强談話之意見通告英外相西門、西門旋延見法意大使、告以德國之建議、下星期國聯舉行軍縮討論時、德國將以其駐英大使那杜尼爲出席代表、屆時各國代表團將討論德國之建議、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外次艾登定明晨赴日内瓦、外相西門大約將於十月十日繼之而往、日内瓦各國代表團在下星期杪前未必續開談判、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法國外長彭古、於今晨行抵此間、即與國聯會意國代表阿樂亞西男爵會晤、自羅馬方面接得德國關於軍縮問題之口頭答復後、意國政府之正式意見若何、阿樂亞西不能據以告知彭古、但謂彼將於今晚啟程返羅馬、或可於下星期内重來日内瓦、但必於十月十六日軍縮總委員會開會時趕到、彼時當可獲得意國政府之完全訓令云、彭古擬於午後與軍縮會議美國代表臺維斯日本首席代席佐籐會商、軍縮會議德國代表那多尼則將於星期日抵日内瓦、至軍縮會議主席團會議、仍定於星期一午後舉行、惟此項會議、將不至有重要政治性質、則已逐漸明瞭、大槪主席團僅將聆取主席漢特森對於主席團散會以來所有經過情形之報告、繼乃决定總委員會重行開會之日期、此日期大約當如上述、定於十月十六日云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法見解不同</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）德政府今日對英意政府宣布其對於軍縮各要點之立塲、此並非德國之新建議、亦非其有禮貌的要求、不過爲德國根本見解之明白解釋、前在談判中已有此表示、德國牒文、仍主張按照列强所接受權利平等之原則、軍備雄厚諸强國之大事减縮、實屬必要、俾可近於德國軍備目前之狀况、否則當許德國置有團防必要武器云、據倫敦消息、英政府視德國之牒文爲談判可能的基礎、惟法國各界、則謂德國牒文、仍完全不能接受、第無論如何、德國今此之步驟、已消除軍縮談判繼續延緩之任何藉口矣（六日國民）　　（巴黎）德國牒文之内容、雖尚未發表、但法國各報議論、殊見緊張、似該牒文完全爲拒絶性質、毫不能增進軍縮大會之希望、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>或有變更可能</h3>
<p>（倫敦）昨日德國駐英代辦畢土麥克向外務部提出關於軍縮問題之德國意見、此間官場人士似認爲係一種原則上之聲明、未必具有確定之性質、易语言之、即日後日内瓦方面舉行討論時、德國意見或可有所變更也、一般人士謂德國見地與原來英國軍縮計畫、雖大旨頗相接近、但此項計畫、當時僅擬作爲討論之基礎、多數國家皆已提出保留、即如法國亦曾提出若干項修正案、其大多數業爲英國所接受、此層似非德國對案所能更易、蓋英國一旦接受德國對案、即係後退、重提舊案、此非英國政府所願聞也、槪括言之、最近數星期來、失次國際談話、係所以矯正英國軍縮計畫之原有缺點、此項矯正、業已經倫敦方面裁可、且爲謀軍縮公約成就所不可缺之條件、今德國竟加以漠視、固難免受人訾議矣、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>將有數國破産</h3>
<p>（倫敦）包爾漫今日在白明漢保守黨大會演說、謂英國如覺自已軍額較低、而他國較高、則當使該國減低、而使吾人提高、至彼此平等而後已、捨此方式之軍縮公約、英國不願與聞、任何國於簽定公約時而加以破壞者、則必在文明世界中孤立無友、任何國提出他日或可接受而今日實難接受之要求、故意使公約不能成立者、亦然、包爾温繼發警告曰、如歐洲重行競置軍備、則此後三十年内以前所減之俸、不能恢復、捐稅萬難減輕、而將有數國爲之破産、包氏末乃申述財相張伯倫所抱之樂觀、即英國商業今較任何實業國爲佳、英國之信用鞏固而無爲人破壞之虞是、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國防務鞏固</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國急進社會黨在維希開大會、今日下午討論殖民地間題時、經熱烈辯論後、絶大多數、拒絶法政府建築縱貫蕯哈拉大沙漠鐵路計劃、按法政府計劃築路八年、每年約需三七五·○○○·○○○佛郎、該黨國會議員艾士雖稱、造路可以救濟失業、而其他剛會議員數人均謂、目下國家財力、不能供此鉅大耗費、結果遂遭大多數拒絶、嗣乃討論國防問題、又當今晨集議時、狄美羅將軍曾官讀一論文、贊成達拉第軍備政策、聲稱、軍備經費倘再滅削、則國防必受損害、至軍費之撙節、可逐漸减少常備軍與海軍兵額、及繼續改組航空隊、並答集議員之反對、謂法國防務之鞏固、足以拒却任何可能之攻擊、最後乃通過一動議、主張最大限度之安全、必須最小限度之成本獲得之云、（六日國民電）</p>

<h3>乾元莊清理後　市商會議補救莊票辦法</h3>
<p>新聲社云、南市花衣街施家弄乾元福記錢莊、於九月三十日、突然停業清理後、發生重大糾葛市商會除辦理拒絶付欵證明外、昨日召集銀錢業等、集議補救辦法、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>清理經過　乾元福記莊、資本二十二萬四千元、股東爲鄭鑑之二股半、郭光裕堂二股、陳子芳一股半、姚紫若一股半、王季謀一股半、鄭洪亭一股、經理沈履康、恊理朱萼生、係錢業同業公會會員、開設迄今、已五十年、於九月三十日、因營業關係、突然宣告停業、由統理沈履康委託席裕昌律師辦理清理、並報告錢業同業公會、由律師於十月二日登報通告債權人、於一星期日、携帶據證登記、</p>
<p>拒絶付欵　各執票人、於九月三十日、持票至乾元福記莊、請求付欵、該莊收票據、允許照付、並卽將票團銷　而忽首停業　將已圈銷之票退進執票人携回、於是各執票人、以旣已收票不應拖絶付欵而退還之票、尤不應圈銷、因票據圈銷、已告作廢松請市商會救濟、市商會得各執票人請求後、即依照票據法律第一零三條拒絶證書、由執票人請求拒絶承兌地或拒絶付欵地之公證人·或去　·商會·銀行公會·作成之發給拒絶付欵證書、由各執票人塡寫後、送商會將原票粘附、加蓋商命　鄭鈐記、以資證明、</p>
<p>集議補救　市商會於昨日下午三時、召集銀錢業·　緞業集議補救辦法、到錢業公會泰誤卿·銀行公會徐寳祺·綢緞業公便孫海山·　鳳韶·等由商會商務科主任絡清華主席、首由綢緞業陳述乾元莊退票　原根拒絶收受情形、繼由錢業報告、歷來習慣、及票據法之規定、應退原根、當决定以票退原根爲原則、依據票據法第九十三條之規定、（發票人承兌人背書人·及其他據債務人、對於執票人連帶負責、執票人得不依負擔債務之先後、對於前項債務人之一人或數人或全體、行使追索權、執票人對於債務人之一人或數人已爲追索者、對於其他票據債務人、仍得行使追索權、）</p>
<p>莊票信用　據新聲計調查、此次乾元莊宣告清理、將莊票未付欵卽圈銷、辦法實異常錯誤、且影響莊票信用、因莊票俗稱本票錢莊發出後、卽絶對負責、流通市面、無異現欵、其信用向極堅實、卽使錢莊發生問題、而錢莊股東、均應負無限責任、目按照現行法律、應連帶負責、故錢莊負責、而不由出票人負責、以出票人發出此票時、早已將現欵付入錢莊、故錢莊始能發票也、此次乾元清理後、在綢緞業方面、持有該莊票者、因不能兌現、紛紛退還原手、而原手方面、亦有根據契約法拒絶收受者、因此發生爭議、但關於本案、無論如何結果、執票人决不致受捐失、因如果乾元莊票、不能十足兌現、則將來必致全市莊票、咸受信用上之影響也、</p>

<h3>走路</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>世上只有三種人，是不會走路的。一種是襁褓中的嬰孩，有他媽媽懷抱着，用不着走路。一種是跛足的殘廢者，卽使用了拐杖，也走不動路。一種是有錢的人，摩託卡，飛機，私人自備着，除了在室中盤旋以外，眞是不須勞動那一雙尊足。和那三種人站在相反的地位，要算人力車夫和信差了。他最勞動的是一雙苦命的脚，一天不走路，便一天餓肚子。他靠了兩足，告了走路，綫有硬轉　啃，緝得一天天的延着殘命。不過又有人說現在的信差，坐着自由事，用不着走路。我想自由車用兩足踏着，和走路差不多，比較上稍爲舒適些吧了。</p>
<p>没錢的人，除了長途來往，不得不用舟車代步外，日常上工下工，訪親戚，找朋友，都用兩足走着。一方面果然爲了節省經濟，可是另外還有一種好處，照進化論上說［凡是人身上的四肢百體，毛髮爪牙，越是運用，越是利害，不去用他，便會淘汰。］拿我們的爪牙毛髮來證明，倒有幾分可信。倘使人們坐了舟車，不用走路，兩脚也没有用了，一代代的遺傳下去，豈不淘汰得成了一個没脚蛋嗎？這樣說來，走路的人們，倒是保全兩脚的大功臣，研究優生事的急先鋒咧！</p>
<p>在上海走路的人們，有兩種絶不相同的心理。一種是贊成走路的，他們說上海的路，再平坦整潔没有的了。用柏油　着，天晴有澆水車，灰塵不揚；天雨有水溝洩水，不會積頓。莫說走着適意，便是把身子躺下，也不會沾一些塵埃。晚上街燈亮如白盡，也不會撞壁墮溷。這種路不走，豈不是有福不會享嗎？一種是反對走路的，他說馬路如虎路，走着多麽危險？每天給汽車電車撞死的，不知幾多，還有空中斷下的電綫，碰着也會喪命；有時巡捕捉拿盜匪，也有吃流彈的危險。小面至於你向商店中瞧看，袋裏的東西，不翼而飛。不留心和白相弟兄碰一下身子，雀會軋你到老虎灶上大講斤頭。還是坐了車子，可以免去一切無謂的犧牲。這兩種理由，誰是誰非？請閱者們批評一下吧！</p>
<p>人心是不知足的，走路嫌慢騎馬兒，坐了馬兒還嫌慢，不得不改用摩托卡了。人也是貪安逸的，便拿在下來說在鄉下没有車兒，跑上十里八里路，不算一回事。到了上海，一些些的路程，不是人力車，便是電車公共汽車，再也不肯安步當車的了。所以在都市中說到走路一事，倒也是難能可貴。除了運動員萬米競賽，肯放開大步，向前奔跑外，此外還有誰肯走上十里八里的路呢？</p>
<h3>初秋的江灣</h3>
<p>顧錫章</p>
<p>日球的火燄，不如從前那魔酷烈，知了的呼聲，微弱得像游絲的一息。</p>
<p>摩登的密絲們，在輕綢的旗袍上加了一件顔色鮮艶的背心。</p>
<p>啊丨新秋追蹤着暮夜悄悄地攅進了人間，無怪在清晨在暮晚，我穿着單衣似乎感到有些凉意。</p>
<p>可不是嗎？農村的塲角邊塔尖般堆起一堆堆的新稻，雪一般白潔的棉花已在江灣市塲上發現，這是農人們把整年的心血和勞力灌漑得來秋收的代價。</p>
<p>記得，我深深地記得，去年的新秋時分，我曾從滬杭路的Ｘ城來憑吊這刦後的市鎭，那時呢喃的雙燕也從塞北飛到這南國的刦地，在　下，在樑問，想找覓牠去年所建的窩巢，［燕啊！你的舊巢早被日本兵的砲火燬刦了，你到那裏去找尋呢？燕啊！你是無家可歸了，還是回到北國去吧，］我曾默默地對着來去的飛燕想訴說。</p>
<p>燕啊！今年你又跟了新秋從曾經烽烟的北國飛到江南的舊地，燕啊！你也許有［天下之大，無處立錐］的感想吧。</p>
<p>燕啊，請再費你的辛勞，重建你的新巢，在刦後的江灣，和我重度過那凉秋的生活吧。</p>

<h3>中山路上</h3>
<p>— 李鵬翔</p>
<p>據懼内的朋友說［在他們的目光裏看來，家庭是一個監獄；只有家庭門口以外的土地，才是他們所有的世界。］</p>
<p>一個文學家的演講稿謿說［女人就是Ｇog］。一個讀他遺稿的人，懷疑着印書局裏把Dog一字倒排了。</p>
<p>一個爲妻子馴服了的丈夫，要是在外面走入迷途，總是怨他的朋友把他引誘去的。决不會想到伊丈夫所以出外的原因。</p>
<p>女人的心，像天上白雲，只要看那一面來的風勢大她就會給他推動。風勢小的早該回避；否則反會受到意外的禍殃。（安夫）</p>
<p>從　娃栗妲村。</p>
<p>中山路，筆直的臥着，聲息也没有。原來它睡着了。它做夢；馬蹄的錢踏，汽車的飛馳，女工的脚音。</p>
<h3>［自稱家父爲令尊］</h3>
<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>［大］字，本來是用以區别事物的大小，長幼，尊卑。諸如，泰山，崑崙以及頭髮，細砂。家長之與小輩；長官之與下屬。</p>
<p>目今眞是貽笑大方丨普而通者，像律師，醫師，只要你跨過熱鬧的馬路，你便可以見到滿目皆是的［ＸＸ大律師事務所］的招牌！</p>
<p>幾椽小房子的旅社，亦寫上［ＸＸ大飯店］的字樣。上海的大，眞是無大不有了！［ＸＸ大戲院］，［ＸＸ大舞台］。這也許是住上海的人愛［大］的緣故？你看，油醬業的［官醬園］典押業的［當］寫得多麽大！</p>
<p>更進一步，你可以在租界謿看到耀武揚威的各國海軍，他們的帽章上，亦鐫了幾個［大ＸＸ帝國海軍］的字樣，［大ＸＸ帝國］，哼！這眞是，我不是一個輿地學家，我不能用正確的量凖來說，但拿起來較之我們中國，的確是只有百份之幾？哈，哈！此之所謂大，大，大！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回　酸楚褾懷當前還祝福倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>這理由很明白，因爲當旅團長的人，總可以看看報，不能看報也可以在應酬塲上，得着一些時局消息，命令是不能十分含糊的。至於團長對付營長，在身分上，無須乎十分客氣了，所以只告訴他要移防，快造表册，移防向那裏，團長固然可以揣度得一些，可是他也不能把那揣度之辭來告訴營長。所以這命令到了營長這裏，已經只有原意十分之一二，營長也不能那樣老實，將得來的命令，完全告訴了連長。他所知道較具體一些的，就是幾天之内，就要移防。至少，這一點，他是應當保留的，於是乎他告訴連長的，就是快造本連人馬裝械數目表册，乾脆，連移防兩個字也不提。當日趙自强得了營部的命令，快造表册，這是軍隊開拔以前的一個預兆，有了這種事情發生，一定是要開拔的。在平常的時候，軍隊由東移到西，由西移到東，那算不了什麽。據現在的情形看起來，那一定是和日本軍隊打仗。打仗怕什麽，軍人不爲是打仗來的麽？要怕打仗，以前就不該來當兵。只是有一層，自已是剛訂婚的人，自已正希望着度那美滿家庭的生活，却不料一點未婚夫妻的滋味未曾當到，這就要離開海甸，眞令人掃興之至。論到自已本身，掃興不掃興，這都没有多大的關係，最不堪的，就是把這話告訴了桂枝，桂枝要多麽難受！他原來是不大願意嫁軍人的，就爲了軍人，總是不能在家裏。見好容易，把他辦得回心轉意了，剛訂婚就要離開，這不明明的是告訴人，軍人萬萬嫁不得嗎。（二○六）</p>
<p>滿目的荒凉墳山，樹木，蔓草。中山路像一條死蛇僵僵的直臥在那裏。馬糞，汚泥，像蛇身上的花斑。一輛汽車馳過，埃塵滿天的飛，迷糊了天空，路旁的草舍，行人的眼睛</p>
<p>清晨，太陽剛剛露出他的臉孔，得得的馬蹄便在這路上馳騁了。黄的白的馬袴，飄在頸後的領帶，亮晃晃的長靴，高捲的袖子，得意洋洋的臉兒。外國的青年，中國的大學生。男的，女的，二匹馬並在一起飛奔，緊緊的。人間的快樂被他們佔盡了，艶羨的眼都集中在他們的身上。</p>
<p>在傍晚，一隊一隊的女工，提了食籃，緩緩地，疲乏地，踏着滿是馬糞，汚泥的路回家。汽車從後面馳來，兩盞大電燈在朦朧的黑暗裏放射着閃閃的强光，像一對惡獸的眼睛。飄忽的領帶，蓬鬆的美髮，一閃，過去了是兜風。</p>
<p>一個二個的外國男女，浴在蒼茫的夜色裏，懶散的走着。是打高而富回來，　我的朋友說這所以呌［自稱家父爲令尊］。</p>
<p>我說何不痛快地，呌爲［夜郎自大］呢？</p>
<p>不禁相顧大笑。</p>

<h3>一種新興的農作物</h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>農村經濟破産的呼聲，已經震耳欲　；然而徒事鼓噪，不籌善後，必至無可救藥，善後之法維何？除研究社會分配問覘或改良種子和農其外只有注意於新興的農作物，除蟲菊原産於奥國的達爾馬西亞地方，在一五零六年，纔發現牠有除蟲的特效，爲各國所重視，現在的産地，大部份已集中於日本，輸出額年達千萬元之鉅；但在我國，還算一種新興的農作物，近始有人注意種植，例如家庭工業社因製造蚊香所用的主要原料爲除蟲菊粉，而又感覺到此項國産原料的缺乏，乃與上海銀行農業合作貸欵部合作，無代價的供給種子，由上海銀行委託各農村合作社承種；然全國工廠需要很多，非積極提倡種植，仍恐不能不仰給於國外，因就所知，略舉如下，以供農作家參二</p>
<p>（一）效力　除蟲菊含有一種不揮發的酸性，無論螞蟻臭蟲虱子𧓝蛄尺蠖天牛卷葉蟲浮塵子和其�</p>
<p>他一切害蟲等都可月除蟲菊粉滅除，例如（一）木灰八分，混和除蟲菊一分，密閉一畫夜，撤諸植物莖葉，害蟲便滅，（二）除蟲菊一分，小麥粉二分混和，可殺傢具和禽畜毛羽中的害蟲，（三）清水酒精各一升入除蟲菊粉五兩，浸一日夜，用時將此混合液一分和清水十分，可殺一切甲蟲，（四）除蟲菊七十五磅，榆麵二十五磅配合，可成辟蚊香。</p>
<p>（二）種類　除蟲菊是菊科植物，有紅白兩種紅的原産於高如索和波斯山中，但殺蟲的效力很小，只供玩賞；白的就是前面所述的原産於奥國達爾馬西亞的一種，性質强，産量豐，殺蟲的效力又大。</p>
<p>（三）播種　分春秋兩期播種春期在廢歷二月和三月之間；秋期在七月和八月之間，在没有播種之前，該預備苗牀，上敷厚約三四寸的很鬆細的泥土，泥土之上，再敷篩過的表土，並澆以腐爛的人糞或尿，經過四五日，始可撤種，但種子撒下，仍須覆以細土，再用板輕壓，蓋以稻草；萌芽後，把稻草除去，尤必預備陰棚，以防强烈的日光和暴風急雨的傷害，到了苗高約二寸長的時候，還須經過一度移植，每枝相隔三寸許，此名假植，至定植期間，通常以春播的在九月間實行，秋播，在次年四月間實行，除蟲菊生活年限很長，但至相當年度，可用分根法以延長其壽命，不須另行播種。</p>
<p>（四）土地和肥料　種除蟲菊的土地，最忌排水不良的低窪；而用淡素的肥料過多，只滋長　葉，不生花蕾，也是等於没有收獲的，因爲除蟲菊殺蟲的酸素，以花中所含爲最多，制造蚊香売全是採用花粉啊。</p>
<p>（五）價值每畝地至少可收乾花六十餘斤，多則一百二十斤，價值五六十元至八九十元不等，比較他種農作物所獲的利益，眞不可以道里計；而且山坡，河坪，荒地，砂地等，本不值錢，但拿來種除蟲菊，則極相宜，又何樂而不爲？</p>
<p>以上所寫，多從各書參考得來，而尤以如辠朱頌熙君的［實騐除蟲菊之栽培法］中選擇爲最多；因他是個種植除蟲菊的實騐家，說話當更有可靠，至於詳細情形，希望農藝專家把實騐所得，隨時貢獻給社會，我不過就我所知道的一點和盤托出，好讓從事於農村救濟工作的先生們多多注意而已。</p>

<h3>上週美棉受借欵限制而不振</h3>
<p>紐約十月六日電告一週棉市狀况云、本週原棉交易、受有限制、因市塲中人欲待棉花借欵計畫之詳情、及政府下屆棉産報告也、（下屆報告十月九日發表）田中棉花現紛紛運出、在此每磅一角之借欵尚未到手時、農民之亟需現欵者、漸照目前價格售去其棉、於是套賣者漸多、治價低時售出者、悉爲同業之購進、與缺方之抵補所吸收、近屢有囤積運動逐漸發展之說、衆信此項運動、俟政府借欵可得時、當更　著、聞西南棉農現囤積其棉百分之三十至百分之六十、同時一般注意、刻集中於一般商業與貨幣之情形、曁借欵計畫及於南方推銷政策之影響、明年植棉之統制計畫、當可使人列堅其對於棉花最後價值之信任、</p>
<h3>糧食新粳湧到步跌角餘</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源四十餘號、其中以新貨居多、本街店胃因天雨、忽轉懈勢、各帮新粳及各新尖市况驟見垂軟、後雖售方極力扳俏、終以去路有限、各新粳下跌一二角、新尖修去數分至近角、破粳及薄薄等因貨乏尙堅穩、新陰元仍現俏色、常帮粳及變元依舊斷跡無市、至若客帮包胃、聞因客地市價　甩、合算殊難得利致續停辦云、　（滬北）昨日河下各路來源四十餘號、晨間天雨、市上各貨去胃平常、市形白破粳次變元緊尺許、西新粳新杜尖價小數分、新陳羊尖·新埠尖·新陳客尖·薄稻·新陰元·　種·百果·東新粳等價、平定之勢、</p>
<h3>客仙銷活價漲一角</h3>
<p>▲産價漲後來源减少</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、湘米已有直接裝連膺州、産價報漲、划申昻大、後首辦裝又難通運、途貨已經到齊、此外已無續到、南京方面來源亦少、因皖米由蕪湖出口赴潮州汕頭、兩地産價均漲、起七八角至一元不等、而申地自前週價昻旺到之後、市面立定、已不再漲、故販運又爲觀望、昨閩省福州泉州辦胃復番、汕頭帮復又問津、到乏銷活、價漲一角、全日由汕頭帮辦去南京機秈七百多包、湖南糙靖五百包、閩省辦去湖南機米一千二百五十包、又　米五百五十包、糙米一千餘包、錫秈六百包、行情各漲一角左右云、</p>
<h3>粉市昨已照常開拍</h3>
<p>丨初開銳跌···繼卽回俏</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午因追證問題、尚未解决、故未開市、下午因多數已經繳納、遂照常開拍、惟初開時、市塲人心、依然悲觀、因洋麥報價、芝加哥又跌一元二角另、坎拿大跌四角另、且以標麥之銳落、人心尤不見定、故開價時、本月份又復大落、新紀録重見、最低至二元一角二分半、遠期亦各落一二分不等、惟以後則步見回俏、因天津帮微有胃口、緣砲車抽進三五萬包、直送天津、照標準加八分、遠期則因大小廠一致暫停、故市氣遂見步穩、觀前途或可暫時平靜、再看國外情形爲升沉耳、結果本月份較跌一分、十一月份未動、十二月一月份小五厘、二月份好二厘半、三月份小二厘半云、又交易所公布市塲、自昨日起、賣方證金增爲每千包五百元、買方照舊云、</p>
<h3>期麥初跌繼回</h3>
<p>▲現貨步鬆···開六千三百包</p>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後各月份又呈一致疲軟之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥續跌一元二角零、坎拿大跌四角零、並以洋麥之兜售不絶、人心尤感不安、故自開價後、各月份較之前日、又落二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、初仍平平、旋因粉市已開、價亦盤上、故入心稍見良好、業外之浮空、亦起抵補、致開價略有生氣、不過洋麥兜售未已、前途終覺可慮也、結果本月份較小二分、十一月份不動、十二月好一分、一月份不動、二三月份各好一分、現麥市面、交易尚暢、價則步呈鬆落、中次貨跌五分一角不等、開湖熱麥三元五角八分、鎭江麥三元五角七分、高郵麥三元七角七分、次五角八分、露筋麥三元七角二分、揚州麥三元六角六分、　潼麥三元七角、次六角、臨淮關三元六角六分、計六千三百包云、</p>
<h3>芝蔴市難以進展</h3>
<p>芝蔴市况雖步降、然比别種糧市尙佳、故其來源續接惟貨主都抱脫售、致市勢不易立足、幸本街辦胃尚健、出口少數點綴、昨由寧波帮採去管店蔴一百餘包、價開七元九角二、本街共辦管店芝蔴二百餘包、價七元四角半、及窑灣六十二包、價六元一角半、九江芝蔴二十包、價五元九角、揚州芝蔴五十包、價亦開五元九角、又丹陽黑芝蔴五十包、價售六元、紹帮因貨價不合、是以觀望多日矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨新生晒肉開價高昻</h3>
<p>新生晒圓肉、近以到稀、且地價迭升、故市勢頗緊、昨碼生晒肉開至一百零三元許、厦生晒肉七十五元、惟陳貨以色澤不佳、相差頗遠、難得善價、號家尙在扳持中、守候轉機云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白隨關金轉緊</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金轉升、趨勢復緊、公會划盤二四粗砂白普通貨呌升二十一元六角半、二十號中砂白、及荷赤呌價與昨相仿、但今日適值週末無裝出、故均乏成交、太古糖Ｂ嘜呌升五分、爲二十一元七角、ＤＹ嘜二十一元二角半、稍有成交、中華國華棉白頂號二十元八角、一號六角、二號四角、三號二角、四號二十元、振記一號綿呌二十元六角半、未成、光華祿字呌二十元八角潮青以談價不合、均無續開、</p>
<h3>疋頭各國呢羢價均上漲</h3>
<p>昨呢絨交易甚盛、公會上市氣頗佳、而貨價自德記行盤加漲後、其他各國呢絨、昨亦均上漲、國貨亦有數進提高、蓋國外毛價報漲、洋行定價增貴、關稅增加、呢絨成本突昻、刻以英法兩國之貨漲勢最烈、次爲嗬美德等貨、日本及我國出産之貨、漲勢較平、均每碼祇漲二分半至五分光景、國貨導華絲光羽紗不退色頭號貨批售九角、二號貨爲八角半、</p>
<h3>五金本廠元釘價提一角</h3>
<p>本廠元釘、近因出路興旺、而原料來貨不多、市上時起恐慌、最近賣方以限制買方起見、故提價一角、以資調劑、計每桶倍司價爲七元二角、而出口貨則要七元八角、倍司加起、雖昨日天雨綿連、聞成交仍有七八百桶之多、查其胃口、當推長江路爲最勁、</p>
<h3>黑鐵皮有斷擋之虞</h3>
<p>十八張黑鐵皮昨天津帮羣起收辦、故市風頓佳、行情雖不見提加、但一種英　之趨况、殊非昔比、聞昨市開出共有一千四五百担之多、其價每担爲十一元四角、</p>
<h3>絲茶歐美絲市益呈悲觀</h3>
<p>（海外現絲價愈趨愈下）美莊乾利·法莊信孚等行、昨晨又接海外絲市電報、生絲市塲因囤户競出、廠銷呆滯、絲價愈趨愈下、紐約現絲每磅已跌進美金一元六角大關、里昻白廠經前日又跌兩法郎、Ａ級扯合華幣每包價祇八百七十九元、較週一又跌二十餘元、前途益抱悲觀、</p>
<p>（日本人造絲讓價傾銷）邇來日本人造絲運滬日暢、日商積極襄價傾銷、日來長江烟青等帮在滬購進櫻花美人等牌日本人造絲現貨二百餘箱、價較歐美人造絲廉四五十元、且包裝包運至目的地云、</p>
<p>（洋莊絲銷難望轉機）海外絲市愈形惡劣、絲價一落千丈、華絲去電均嫌價昻而不轉、華絲商手中存絲充厚、無人問訊、昨祇達昌等進黄廠經十一包、黄組絲十包、價益趨疲、</p>
<h3>珍眉珠茶交易旺盛</h3>
<p>昨日來路莊之珍眉珠茶、英商錦隆同孚恊和杜德等行、均有進胃、針眉秀眉等項、亦多有交易、全市共計成交緣茶一千三百餘箱、其中抽蕊珍眉、售開一百八十八元、普通工色形眉、售開一百二十七元、市價均頗爲堅硬、惟針眉·秀眉等項、市價又跌四五元、就現下市情觀察、依然有跌無漲云、</p>

<h3>庸人的自擾</h3>
<p>— 歐碧</p>
<p>本來可過太平日子的，只是給那些唐人來一擾，天下便就此多事了。</p>
<p>崇讚大英帝國難道是一件壞事嗎？我崇讚我的，爲什麽要你們來多管閒事？而且你們又管得了嗎？大英帝國的國旗不還是凡太陽所照到的地方都挿到？你們這輩庸人！</p>
<p>大英帝國是無可異議地該被崇讚的，你眞想不透你崇讚了它人家爲什麽要來攻擊你。也許，或者，他們是無國籍的流民，也許他們是什麽别的帝國的走狗，也許他們在眼紅，看不得你，不然，他們就一定是只愛自擾的庸人。</p>
<p>可是，不管他們是什麽，你受了他們的攻擊總有此氣憤。你總得反攻一下才心裏痛快。於是你搜求那攻擊你的人的弱點；搜求到了，你預備威赫地一箭便置他的死命。</p>
<p>終於，那被你看做他的弱點的你的箭標給你找到了，原來他是一個東三省國人。</p>
<p>於是你便可得意地說你這東三省國人，你竟不知道你們是在遭受誰的虐待？你不回到你本國去革命，却反在這大中華民國帮人拔劍？難道你也想做援助希臘革命的拜崙？你那樣問，你意思是在笑他無恥。要是你自已是東三省國人，照你意思，你早就回去革命了，不會再躭在上海露醜。對咧，上海，你相信上海完全地是大中華民國的，决不受任何别的國家的侵略，否則你了會革命了的。而且就是受了什麽别的國家的侵略，至多也只是大英帝國的，那就没有什麽關係，因爲大英帝國是你所崇讚的。</p>
<p>而且，即使他不是東三省國人，他總有弱點會給你抓到的。此如，他或者在犯着失眼症，你便可駡道你自已的身體都没有管好，還要來管人家，配？</p>
<p>於是你的氣出了，而同時，大英帝國的國旗依舊隨着太陽的光芒遍佈於全世界。</p>
<p>［天下本無事，庸人自擾之！］最後你便若有所得地這樣感歎着。</p>
<h3>［莊子］與［文選］</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>上個月大晚報的編輯寄了一張印着表格的郵片來，要我塡註兩項（一）目下在讀什麽書，（二）要介紹給青年的書。</p>
<p>在第二項中，我寫着［莊子］，［文選］，并且附加了一句註脚［爲青年文學修養之助］。</p>
<p>今天看見自由談上豐之餘先生的［感舊］一文，不覺有點神經過敏起來，以爲豐先生這篇文章是爲我而作的了。</p>
<p>但是現在我並不想對於豐先生有什麽辯難，我祗想趁此機會替自已作一個解釋。</p>
<p>第一，我應當說明我爲什麽希望青年人讀［莊子］和［文選］。近數年來，我的生活，從國文敎師轉到編雜誌，與青年人的文章接觸的機會實在太多了。我總感覺到這些青年人的文章太拙直，字彙太小，所以在大晚報編輯寄來的狹狹的行格裏推薦了這兩部書。我以爲從這兩部書中可以參悟一點做文章的方法，同時也可以擴大一點字彙（雖然其中有許多字是已死了的）。但是我當然並不希望青年人都去做［莊子］，［文選］一類的［古文］。</p>
<p>第二，我應當說明我祗是希望有志於文學的青年能夠讀一讀這兩部書。我以爲，每一個文學者必須要有所借助於他上代的文學，我不懂得［新文學］和［舊文學］這中間究竟是以何者爲分界的。在文學上，我以爲［舊瓶裝新酒］與［新瓶裝舊酒］這譬喻是不對的。倘若我們把一個人的文學修養比之爲酒，那麽我們可以這樣說酒瓶的新舊没有關係，但這酒必須是釀造出來的。</p>
<p>我勸文學青年讀［莊子］與［文選］，目的在要他們［釀造］，倘若大晚報編輯寄來的表格再寬闊一點的話，我是想再多寫幾部書進去的。</p>
<p>這裏，我們不妨舉魯迅先生來說，像魯迅先生那樣的新文學家，似乎可以算是十足的新瓶了。但是他的酒呢？純粹的白蘭地嗎？我就不能相信。没有經過古文學的修養，魯迅先生的新文章决不會寫到現在那樣好。所以，我敢說在魯迅先生那樣的瓶子裏，也免不了有許多五加皮或紹興老酒的成分。</p>
<p>至於豐之餘先生以爲寫篆字，塡詞，用自刻印板的信封，都是不出身於學校，或國學專家們的事情，我以爲這也有點武斷。這些其實祇是個人的事情，如果寫篆字的人，不以篆字寫信，如果塡詞的人做了官不以詞取士，如果用自刻印板信封的人不勉强别人也去刻一個專用信封，那也無須豐先生口誅筆伐地去認爲［謬種］和［妖孽］了。</p>
<p>新文學字中，也有玩木刻，考究版本，收羅藏書票，以駢體文爲白話書信作序，甚至寫字臺上陳列了小擺設的，照豐先生的意見說來，難道他們是［要以［今雅］立足於天地之頀］嗎？我想他們也未必有此企圖。</p>
<p>臨了，我希望豐先生那篇文章並不是爲我而作的。</p>
<h3>羅黑芷和彭家煌</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>羅黑芷和彭家煌，這兩個人，我都不認識。但他們同是已經死去了的中國現代作家，而他們的作品又同屬於舊寫實主義範圍之内，並且他們兩人的命運也非常相像。偶然對過去的中國文壇做一次回顧，想起了充滿感傷氣分的那時代，忍不住把他們兩人來做一下比較。</p>
<p>說起來眞是一件耐人尋味的事，試把羅黑芷的［春日］，和彭家煌的［慫恿］放在一起，不但是形式，就是内容也非常相像。羅黑芷的作品，通常是從一件極平凡的小事裏面，寫出人生最廣汎的悲哀。他的文字是温柔的，但内中却包含着辛酸。彭家煌的表現力雖亦近似，不過他好說廢話，使讀者的注意力分散；不能像羅黑芷那樣，可短則短，字句都經過有力的鍵鍊，從頭到尾的把握住讀者的感情。</p>
<p>然而可注意的，不在他們的作品，而在他們命運的相像。眞的，在智識階級謿面，要再找一個像羅黑芷和彭家煌那樣宛似從同一的模子裏鑄出來的人，是不可得的。彭家煌是湖南人，羅黑芷雖籍隸江西，生長於蜀，但他娶於湘，卜居於湘，所以也好算是一個湖南人。羅黑芷曾執過敎鞭，彭家煌也曾執過敎鞭。羅黑芷曾進過湖南圖書編譯局，彭家煌也曾進過上海商務印書館。羅黑芷曾入過獄，彭家煌也曾入過獄。羅黑芷的入獄是爲了某種嫌疑，彭家媓的入獄也是爲了某　嫌疑。羅黑芷是死於胃病，彭家煌也是死於胃病。讀杜甫詩［文章憎命逹，魑魅喜人過］。不禁爲這兩位命運相同的作家泫然不止。</p>
<p>羅黑芷和彭家煌，又差不多是同時出現於文壇的。不過羅黑芷死得太快，只留下［醉裏］［春日］兩本小說。他的死，使人忍不住想起日本女作家樋口一葉來，而興［其來何遲其去何速］之感。彭家煌的生命比羅黑芷延長了六年，所以他的小說留下來的也比較多。</p>
<p>在中國，時代似乎過去得特别快㨗。即以文學而論，什麽古典主義，浪漫主義，寫實主義，别人要經過一世紀或半世紀始能繼而代興者，我們則十多年裏早都統統輪輪過了。讀着羅黑芷和彭家煌的遺作，不禁使人起一種懷舊和感傷的情緒。</p>
<h3>澉浦通信（一）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>○○兄</p>
<p>久已生活在都會緊張空氣裏的我，突然的跑到這調子完全相反的海濱的盬鄉的澉浦　來，這多少令你有些驚異吧。可是我終竟來到這裏了。我不是和一般人相似，跑到海濱來換一換生活的調子，我是想因着這一個偶然的機會，來了解生活着在廣大的鹽區裏的鹽民們的生活情形。車子是下午二時從上海出發的，在閔行渡了江，再經過廣大的田野，沿着海塘向前飛馳，到五點鐘，就完畢了這一二七公里的長途，到達了澉浦的城站。當車子過了黄山海浴塲，浙了最後的一個山灣，看到載着五千斤重的古鐘的鐘樓的影像，我們都禁不住的很快活的呌道澉浦到了！</p>
<p>到澉浦是第二次，走滬杭公路也是第二次了；第一回來的時候，感覺着道路很平坦，可是這一回，眞是顚簸得不堪。起　我很懷疑，　什麽幾個月的時間，路竟壞到這樣呢？後來也就明白了；因爲在報紙上，幾個月來，没有看見所謂偉大的人物打這一條路經過。築路，主要的是便利交通，而現在恰恰相反，祇是爲軍事的方便，爲要人的馳騁，吾儕小民，不過是便受其利罷了。這樣，雖然被簸幾小時，我們又能有什麽話說呢？</p>
<p>沿途，經過不少的市鎭，而乍浦是最主要的，因爲這裏有海浴塲。不時的，有富兒挾着愛妻嬌妾來洗浴，有達官貴人到此觀山玩海，有具上海頭腦的外國人到此作郊遵。這裏，有繁華的市面，有公共電話局有公共汽車站，有私立的汽車行，有砲台，有浴塲，爲着商人雅士的方便，不少的必需品是應有盡有，澉浦的農村女子是没有剪髮的，而相隔不到百里的乍浦，却大都是剪了髮，而且修理得很整潔這樣的好的影響，也是由那些遊客而來。不過，人民究竟是受累的，因爲物價由於遊客的要求而被抬高，和上海相差不遠了。</p>
<p>因爲早有預備，對於在澉浦的住食，是没有什麽憂慮。下車以後，就通過那靠近車站的丁字街，走進在礰史上很有名，而現在已經殘敗不堪的古城。你要是雅人，走到這裏，就會感到風景是秀麗的。立在城門口的石橋（我想在過往，這兒完全是一道吊橋）上，沿着護城河一路看去，有山有水，有樹有田，還有那古樸的農民，龐大的耕牛，有君子風的鵝鴨，以及不擊的輕舟，很適合的配置在風景裏面，令你快活無窮。頗是遺憾，我没有做［笑林廣記］中人，不然，看過了這如畫的景物，也要對這一帶城牆，做一首什麽［一齒一齒又一齒，五齒六齒七八齒］的詩。在而，究竟也不能算是遺憾，因爲遠遠望去，在前面就是硤石，那兒躺着我們高貴的詩人徐志摩的遺骸，想他月白風清之夜，登山嘯傲，看到這兒的城齒，定然是會再來一首的。［秋境鬼唱詩］，這是自古已然了，志摩先生豈能獨爲例外麽？呵呵！</p>

<h3>戀之一頁</h3>
<p>— 法國菲立普作　侍桁譯</p>
<p>一點一刻已經過去了，安利戴洛姆在父母的家裏吃完了午飯，又走在路上到事務所來了。他緩慢地走着。上工的時候人們是不首急的。他曉得，工作，無論到什麽時候，總會悠長地等候着他吧。在他走過李柴先生家門前的當兒，正好待女嗎麗從廚房窗口向着街上望。　她正是孤單單的一個人，李柴夫人帶着孩子們到鄉下的親戚家裏去了，要停四五天才得回來。李柴先生又被招到佛瓦爾牧師家裡吃中飯去了。在這麽大的一個家裏，就只有她一個人在看守着。</p>
<p>當然，如果她有更靈活的眼睛，安利戴洛姆會是更喜歡她的吧。她是有着藍色的大眼睛，因爲太大了，中間覺着空空的。但是她有着很好看的紅色的頰，甚至好看得使人都不相信那是頰了。他想，如果一個男人，咬着這個頰，他的嘴裏會感到有滋養的温暖的香甜的汁液流進來吧。是因爲女人有着這樣顔色鮮嫩的頰，男人才想着女人的，說和女人接吻那都是瞎話，女人是可以吃的。她的身材很大，肉也肥肥的。她的大身材是好的，因爲若是吃的話，一定選這種女人來吃。</p>
<p>安利，戴洛姆覺得口裏流着唾沬了，他直到如今也没有發見到他自已是有着這麽大的胃口，他覺得他可以有吞進這個女兒的力量了。因此他不只是感到眼睛看着這個女兒的歡喜，而更是覺到用自已鋼鐵似的牙齒咬着這個可愛的東西的快感了。這個女兒的唇，特别惹起了他的注意。她的唇是很雅緻，肉像是緊縮在那里似的。他想若是吃的話，是該從這塊地方吃起的。</p>
<p>他膽量大得使自已都莫名其妙了。他知道廚房裏只有她一個人，於是他毫不躇躊地走進去。他感覺到。他的上　全部消失掉了，頭裏只剩下一張大嘴。他想從此就要塡滿了他這個新作出來的大嘴了。</p>
<p>女人是與男人不同的動物。她允許他走進來。他走向她的身邊來的時候，她是有點吃驚的，她看着他遠遠地走過來，但一走近她的身邊，她倒覺得格外地平靜，好像没有那麽一回事似的。她一個人在廚房裏，就好像在人馬往來的大街上一樣。她說着不着題的話。</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>摩登論</h3>
<p>— 劉秉彝</p>
<p>現在有許多青年男女愛談［摩登］，無論穿衣剪髮，都要講究［摩登］。一般老年人就禁不住嘆息着說；［摩登足以亡國。一其實仔細想起來：［摩登］倒並不是件壞事，一個民族，一個國家，如其要想從衰邁龍鍾的漩渦裏掙扎起來，還須大大提倡［摩登］。［摩登］非但不足以亡國，而且還可以救國呢。</p>
<p>爲什麽［摩登］足以救國，在這裏我們應該先明白［摩登］兩字的意義。［摩登］兩字是從英文中Ｍodern一詞譯音來的，這個詞的意義，便是：便是［近代］［現世］，包含有一種［新］的意思。我們曉得：人類文明無論是物質的或精神的，［近代的］總是要比［非近代的］好，［新的］總比［舊的］好，這是因爲人類文明天天在那裏進步的緣故。只慚愧中國民族老不長進，事事落後，所以在從前中國人是常被西洋人稱爲［老大帝國］的；即在二十世紀三十年代的今日，中國人還不免被日本帝國主義譏爲［不配稱一個現代的國家］。日本帝國主義的有意侮辱，他們自然覺得可惡。但我們也須回轉頭來想想：照目前中國這樣軍人割據的局面，貪官汚吏的政治，招摇撞騙的社會，迷信鬼神的民智，果眞有一樣配得稱［一個現代的國家］麽？中國民族儻眞不願長此没落，儻眞有志造成一個現代的文明國家豈不還須大大提倡［摩登］嗎？</p>
<p>提倡［摩登］，原是振國厲俗的第一條路。中國聖人賢哲在數千年前早提倡過的。大學的開宗明義第一章就說［大學之道，在明明德，在親民…］，這［親］字依程子朱熹的解釋，應讀作［新］，可見聖人也要敎人［摩登］。又湯之盤銘曰：［苟日新，日日新，又日新，］足見聖人講究［摩登］眞是不遺餘力。其他如論語季氏篇：［周監于二代］，郁郁乎文哉；我從周。］周朝文化在當時比夏商二代爲［摩登］，孔子從周不從夏商，可知孔子也是提倡［摩登］的人。我們中國人有點尊古脾氣，萬事都要尊古崇聖。記得六七十年前，有人學西洋提倡［自由］［平等］，中國士大夫階級還拚命擁護［忠君］［守節［，西洋日本提倡科學衞生，中國大士夫階級還大言不慚說：［小脚是中國的精神文明。］現在這般老年人反對青年男女提倡［摩登］，恐怕也許還含有一點尊古尙聖的臭味，所以不憚引經據典，使他們也知道知道古聖昔賢原也提倡［摩登］的呀！</p>
<p>不過吾還有一些懷疑··現在一般青年所提倡的［摩登］，果眞是［徹頭徹尾］，貨眞價實的［摩登］麽？還是［掛羊頭賣狗肉］的［僞摩登］呢？假如這般青年男女所提倡的［摩登］，祇是衣服頭髮方面的［摩登］，而於思想行爲方面，依舊和那般落伍分子做［一邱之貉］；那只是一種［冐牌式的僞摩登］，非但救不了國，且也救不了自已。因爲現代是一個科學的競爭的世界，合乎［摩登］的青年，在思想方面：應當有爲社會謀福利，爲人類盡職責的見解；在體力方面：應當有好勇鬥狠，有進無退的精神；在知識技能方面：應當有純練的足以自食其力和造福社會的技能。若其不能，祇在衣著服用上講求［摩登］，而腦筋裏所存留的：還是做官發財的思想；體力上所表演的：還是一個力不能縛鷄的文弱書生；知識技能上所具備的：還是不辦菽麥人云亦云的一架兩脚書櫉：那便算不得［眞摩登］，只算得［掛羊頭賣狗肉］的［胃牌摩登］，被人誼咒倒不打緊，只是害了自已一生啊！</p>

<h3>怒吼吧，中國！　剛煎</h3>
<p>— 法人奈寒先生來稿</p>
<p>剛煎（Ｃantine）是工廠設立給下等工人膳宿的館子，他們工資收入太低微了，住不起旅館，就祇得住到那裏去。我現在要寫的是蒙特盧磁器工廠的剛煎。</p>
<p>蒙特盧在巴黎之南，約需兩個鐘頭的火車。</p>
<p>那裏有十餘名華工在從事勞働，其中有曾參加歐戰而現在流落在該處不願回國的，其餘一部份則是偷渡入境的浙江青田人。他們的工資大約每個鐘頭是從二佛郎七十五生了至三佛郎有零。他們做的工，多數是燒窰爐，磨盤子的沙丨一個盤子未塗磁以前，把瓦中的小沙礫現出不平的地方拿來磨擦光滑，好拿去過磁，並把盤之有黑點或形狀歪曲的檢了出來，作次等貨出售。也問或有一兩人在磨盤製造杯盤的，不過這些部門，華工是不容易進去的。</p>
<p>剛煎的房子每間要住六七個人，睡的是木板釘成的床子。麥草的褥子，兩張破舊發臭的棉氈子！</p>
<p>朝晨六點鐘，剛煎的管理人，把各個房門打開，摇着他的鈴子。他好像在呌：［你們起來吧，上工的時候到了！］　　華工們便從這發臭的氈子裏急急跳下床來，表示：［臭虫，我一夜已養肥你了，我得去爲你製造一些滋養的血液來。］於是臭虫們便走進牠們的安樂窩中，休息，休息，把從人身上吸去的血消化掉了。</p>

<p>康女士：有事相煩，請卽駕臨麥根路卽舢板廠新橋西首世德里十九號鶴廬面洽。（林鶴啟）</p>
<p>洶洶的人聲，烟氣的氤氲充滿了這三米突平方的房子。大家拿起手巾走到水喉管邊洗面去，他們中有許多連牙刷也買不起的，於是節省了時間，只也用不着嗽了！</p>
<p>人們還未全洗完臉，飯堂門已打開了。那裏有一碗没有糖味的黑咖啡，熱騰騰地等着人們，給他們一點興奮，俾能好好的工作，	免得那些睡眠不足的人打瞌睡。</p>
<p>吃完了那碗黑咖啡和兩塊麫包，人們便走向工廠去，將勞働力在工作下變成了麫包，繼續不斷地製造勞働的力氣，窮人們便這樣的活着；不，還要拿出一部份來養活臭虫，不然，這剛煎的臭虫怎能過活呢！</p>
<p>工廠的鈴聲響了，大門打開，男男女女，老老少少，擁進了那兒。各人走到各人工作的地方，把塊破布掩住身上的衣衫，在窰邊一點一點的汗珠滴下來！</p>
<p>穿着看護婦一樣白袍的工頭，在那裏抺着他的鬍子走來走去，看看工人們有不對勁的，便駡幾句！</p>
<p>工人們便樣在消磨日子。</p>
<p>十二點來了，牛血香腸，馬鈴　醬在剛煎裏等着人們。還有，還有一杯劣的紅葡萄酒帶點苦味，人們天天都是如此的苦喝着。每天至少要有九佛郎半的消費，你還想吃什麽！</p>
<p>星期六是工人們最快活的一天，因爲這是拿工資的時候。中午前，工頭發給各人一張工資單，於是大家便依着號次在賬房前排着隊伍去拿自已勞働的［代價］。</p>
<p>剛煎的費用被扣去外，僅僅拿得幾十佛郎，各人的衣服，鞋襪，零用等等，都得在那星星的工資中想法子！</p>
<p>三商界名人訪問記</p>
<h3>沈九成先生訪問記</h3>
<p>— 姜尙輿</p>
<p>我丨就是一般人所謂的［公子哥兒］，每天總要吃四瓶牛乳和兩客大菜，以補養身體，因此就做了生生牧塲的一個老主顧。其實，不要說像我們這種住在大公館裏的人，就是普通的人，這　費錢不多的滋養料也是不可少的。今天正在開瓶的當見，忽然注意到一個紅色的Ａ字，就聯想到生生牧塲的沈九成先生，他是一個實業界巨子，就於下午驅車往訪。到了大西路。偉大的生生牛奶公司已赫然在目，但這時我心中却又起了一種念頭：［會不會不許我進見？］後來下了一個决心，想旣然來了，决無空回之理，就鼓着勇氣摸出一張卡片，呌人送了進去。出我意料之外的是，沈先生竟然來請我進去了。到了裏面，那位沈先生很客氣的親自招待我，很誠懇的和我談了許久，還給我吃一瓶牛奶。他把他的歷史詳細的告訴我，說他雖出身於小康之家，但他之能有今日，全在刻苦自勵，勤儉耐勞，致力於實業工作。他在民國元年曾和　友合資創辦三友實業社，初以燭蕊爲特種出品，頗得外邦經營洋燭事業的洋行的信託，營業蒸蒸日上，繼則發行各種棉織品，尤蒙社會人士的贊許。然而際此科學昌明的時代，一切日橷月異，故見人的優者長者，必竭力募仿之，或有未盡善處，必盡力改善之，並抱堅毅的精神，不折不撓，務使成功而後已。平日對於職員和工人，都予以和普通，樣的待遇，以免他們受</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>人蠱惑，而引起無謂的加薪運動和階級鬥爭。幸而大家都能羣策羣力，數年來如一日，所以一家資本極微的商店，竟一躍而佔實業界的重要地位，今已積資至數百萬矣。</p>
<p>沈先生歷年來積勞過度，遂成痰疾。據醫生云，此爲營養不足所致，必須每日飲以鮮牛乳可愈。彼時他感覺中國的牛乳事業，泰半操諸外人之手，每年利權外溢，爲數至鉅，故待病愈後頓起獨力出資數十萬創辦生生牧塲的動機。不久，該牧塲遂宣告成立。經幾年來慘淡經營的結果，沈先生雖不敢自負，然設備方面，已蒙衞生局及工部局認爲滿意，而頒以A字執照。但沈先生的生平目的，並非想發財，也絶非在博此區區的聲譽，以貽沽名之誚，其所抱宗旨，迺係振興實業，復興民族，爲社會服務，爲邦國效勞。因此，生生雖屬獨資經營，但絶非私人企業性質，所以其所用人員，都不是私人，無論如何流離落魄的青年，只要能刻苦耐勞，誠懇服務的，我們親愛的沈先生都樂於量才録用。</p>
<p>最後，沈先生又導我往各處參觀，見内部設備，有蒸氣機，冷汽機，消毒間，科學化的牛棚等等，一切均由沈君加以詳細的解釋，或指其名或述期功效，令人置身其間，方知科學及衞生的重要，又觀其内部組織，也極有系統，且紀律嚴明，職工平時無事一槪不准外出，不禁使我點頭贊嘆不置。由此可知該牧塲之所以能獲得如許的成績，都是沈君一人心力的結晶，否則，曷克臻此？</p>

<h3>［薪水投標］的先聲</h3>
<p>— 蒙義誠女士</p>
<p>銀行這門檻，本不容易跨進去，在過去，這碗飯僅限用於一般與Ｘ理Ｘ板有淵源瓜葛的人們，祇有公子哥兒，小姐奶奶才配到銀行來做事，普通的人，只有在門外張大着眼睛，休想跨進門檻一步！</p>
<p>可是，事實却不然了，最近的報紙上，不是登載着各銀行招考的廣告嗎？這許多公開的考試，都是硬上加硬，以［才］取士的。祇要你窮小子讀書下過苦功，肚皮裏有點學問，一樣的可以中選。進去之後，有吃，有住，年底又有紅，再能做事巴結點，說不定會逐步地高升，行員，主任，Ｘ理，照樣會有你份兒的。</p>
<p>這總算是Ｘ理Ｘ板們動了惻隱之心，聽到千百萬失業者的呼聲，不惜大開銀行的方便之門。這眞是福音來，失業的人們，趕快［頭懸樑］［錐剌股］，日夜的凖備考試吧丨！</p>
<p>然而，應考［試用員］資格，要國内外大學商科畢業，應考［練習生］資格，要高級中學畢業，這可使人丨尤其是没本錢念書的窮小子丨有點爲難了。録取後，［試用員］三個月内僅給津貼三十元，［練習生］月給津貼六元，據在銀行裏辦過事的人說，［行員］要兩年才加一次薪，加起來只有三塊五塊，［練習生］要實習到三年，這和學徒差不多。這樣看來，小行員的生活，原如鳥販子手裏的鳥兒一般，僅有一點小米來維擊殘生，决不會肥胖··日子一久，只落得订痺了翅膀，即使放出籠外，也早已不能奮飛了。</p>
<p>自然，有幾個人還未忘卻他們翅膀的扇動，要在新的開闊的天空中來翺翔，不甘心爲着一點小米，而受道牢徿的束縛，可是，這正是勞力［拍賣］時候，誰的肚皮能不飢餓，失業的人正多着呢！賣的人越减低［血本］，買的人便格外［殺價］，於是，報紙上便紛紛登着招考人材的廣告，銀行裏都雇用六塊錢一月的［練習生］。</p>
<p>我眞有點心驚胆戰的，恐怕在不久的將來，Ｘ理Ｘ板們要求一個［薪水投標］的辦法罷！</p>

<h3>學基本英語没有水喝</h3>
<p>— 柯日清</p>
<p>—讀了兪人偉君的［學基本英語有水喝］以後而作—</p>
<p>以八百五十字作成的基本英語，自劍橋大學敎授奥格登（Ｏgden）公佈以後，各國的語言學言，大多數是擯斥牠，說它不能成功，不能作成國際語。尤其是世界語（Ｅsperanto）學者的全部動員給它（基本英語）以最有力量的批評。</p>
<p>目前在中國不僅世界語者拔弩與之爭鬥，即英語學者林語堂先生，也舉起戈矛參加。自由談，世界之光，新中華，讀者雜誌，……等刋物曾作爲用武之地。</p>
<p>在提倡基本英語的人，他們以爲英語的最大缺點就是單字太多，使人們學習不容易，於是就綜合了八百五十個常用的字，以爲這樣就可解决困難了。其實這是一種最愚蠢的方法，開倒車的方法。因爲社會是一天一天地前進的，語言也是隨着社會而進化，因之文字語言必有增加而没有减少的。祗有用科學方法减少了不必要的語根（Ｒadiko）增加接頭接尾語及文法的作用而又另成一個新字，如世界語（Eaperanto）的Ｐatro（父親）加上了接尾語的Ｉn（女性）而成Ｐatrino（母親），再加一個接頭語的bo而成Ｂopatrino（岳母）······綫是一種科學的减字法。雖然基本英語也採用一種接頭接尾語un'ing'ed等類，可是這僅限於極少數的。所以有Ｆafher（父親）還有Mother（母親）及Ｍotherinlaw（岳母）不</p>
<p>同的分别。</p>
<p>發音，重音，在英語中的困難，是人所公認的。基本英語全没有把這些地方改變過來，依然是如此，依然是一樣的困難。牠全然擯棄了［一音一母，一母一音］的原則，於是讀起來和寫起來就有點兩樣。這全是不合字的組織的邏輯的。</p>
<p>動詞，在英文中是頂麻煩的，可是基本英語僅選得十六個動詞，再加上Ｗill'may兩個助動詞，一共十六個。企圖以十幾個動詞來包括一切的動作，這根本是一種小孩子都不相信的幻想。而在另一方面，它又根本没有把英語的動詞改變一下，依然是不規則變化的。如be的變化om'are'is'been'was'were等字一點没有改良。</p>
<p>爲了基本英語死板板的限於八百五十字，所以許許多多所說的話祗能用來解釋意義，才使人明白領會。如基本英語中没有［留聲機］這個字的，所以僅能用［一個磨光黑色的圓圈，中間晝一隻狗，在一個喇叭之前］來解釋。這不但是沉長的一句話，而且使人不容易領會，甚至莫名其妙，以致弄出許多的笑話。</p>
<p>總而言之，基本英語不但没有把普通英語的缺點改良過來，反而愈改愈壞，成了一種退化的，開倒車的語言，一種死的無用的語言。實在還遠不及一洋涇浜］英語。</p>
<p>如果有人眞的要去學習基本英語，那末，最好先請他看一看基本英語鼓吹人張夢麟先生的幾句［良心話］…［…基本英語，目的是在使人會話，寫作如意，我們學了基本英語之後，可說日常普通話，可以寫信，作文，可以看基本英語作成的書籍，但是，如果要看標凖英語所寫成的書，還得以此爲根據，再去學習···］。從這幾句話看來，就可以知道基本英語對於我們一點帮助都没有。我們是在工餘的時候，偷點時間來求點學識的。［學了……以後］那裏還有這許多時間［再去學習］呢？如果要學習英語的話，倒不如學點［洋涇浜］的更爲妥當。如果要學國際語的話，自然是要去學爲世所公認爲國際語的［愛斯不蘭多］（Ｅeperanto）丨世界語。</p>
<p>基本英語的不能成爲一種語言，西洋鏡早已拆穿了！再不要上當啊！我們勞動者的寳貴求學光陰是要用在有益的學科上去的！</p>
<p>所以，像沈君這樣的人，實在是我們最好的模範。</p>

<h3>蘇聯集體農塲的故事</h3>
<p>— 田青</p>
<p>這還是十六年前却梭文卡村（Ｃhasovenka）的事。</p>
<p>每天朝晨和黄昏，敎堂裏的大鐘發出洪亮的聲音。北國的嚴冬，偷偷起爬進院子裏來。貧農們在焦急着··［怎麽辦？做了整整一年的苦工，只落得錢也没有，麵包也没有。怎樣活下去呢？］　　對於這嚴寒的來臨，只有村裏的富農和牧師在心裏喜歡着。他們有着最沃腴的田地和最肥胖的牲口。</p>
<p>貧農們到敎堂裏去懺悔，向上帝祈禱，把口袋裏最後幾個銅子也帶了去。</p>
<p>十月革命的怒潮，冲激了這幽靜的村莊。國内戰爭開始了。舊俄軍軍官來到了村裏，富農和牧師，他們用了麵包和鹽歡迎這些貴賓，（這是俄羅斯的古禮）並四出組織部隊來襲擊多數黨和貧民。但不久舊俄軍就給趕了出去，却梭文卡村裏建立了另一種的政權。</p>
<p>時閒像水一般地流去。却梭文卡村一步步地在轉變牠的姿容。敎堂裏的大鐘已不再那樣的天天敲了。只有些年老的人還照例去走動，可是對於上帝的信仰已是一落千丈了。這村子跨上了［新的生活］的道路。</p>
<p>第一年</p>
<p>一九二九年三月，四個前衛的農民組織了集體農塲，但是按照法定，一個集體農塲至少要七個會員。於是發起人開始和貧農們談話，說明這個新計劃的利益··［同志們，你們得知道，祖先的生活方式現在已不適用了啊，咱們得除掉咱們的貧苦！］經了一番的努力，這個宣傳又獲得了七個新會員。就是這個樣子，誕生了在這區内最初的集體農塲，呌做［組織者］（Ｏrganizator）。</p>
<p>可是，富農們討壓這個新玩意兒。他們在農民中竭力遊說，來反對集體農塲。於是，集團農塲的農民被人譏笑了，集體農塲的孩子們時常給打了，農塲的器具和設備給破壞了。可是集體農塲的農民並不怕這些困難。他們用全力來繼續他們的集體工作。他們爲了獲得更好的收成而奮鬥。買來了十頭母牛和七匹馬。築起一座很大的新式［養畜所］。一切的工作進行得比個别農民所進行的更爲成功和適當。工作的紀律也建立起來。參加集體農塲生活的利益也就表現出來了。這一年的十月，這個集體農塲已團結了二十二個經營。在年終結算的時候，集體農塲中每個經營的收入，要比個人的經營大一倍半强。</p>
<p>第二年</p>
<p>是一九三零年三月某日的事，本村的俱樂部裏擠滿了人。許多農民甚至只得站在門口和窗外。這果集體農塲會員和個别農民的聯合全體大會。桌子上堆着一疊要求參加集體農塲的請求書，總計有四百張入會書。連富農也要求集體農塲准許他們的參加，但是他們没有成功丨丨十五份請求書被否决了。於是在這天（三月六日），集體農塲已有四百九十個經營了。大會一致議决封開敎堂，建造六座新式的集體［養畜所］。新的工作又馬上開始了。一個月内，便完成了必要的建築工程。</p>
<p>從這時候起。集體農塲用了飛躍的步伐，向前邁進。</p>
<p>第三年</p>
<p>一九三一年春，集體農塲開始了新的進展。參加的經營已增加到五百，並成立了共同食堂，托兒所……等等。在一個［養畜的］裏養着一百十頭母牛。一切的共同工作丨丨播種，收割，進行得異常順利，還應用了許多機器和電力，文化工作也有驚人的發展，文肓很快地掃除盡了。活動的農民被送到都市裏去學習。</p>
<p>第四年</p>
<p>靠了不斷的努力，收成愈益增多了。社會主義的競賽團結了一切的農民，到處充滿着勞動的熱情。工餘之暇，農民在家裏念報，聽無線電。</p>
<p>第五年</p>
<p>一九三三年，集體農塲决定了以下的計劃：增加一千頭家畜　，五十頭猪，五百頭家兎，造二所［養畜所］（每所容一百頭），增加牲口的養料，擴充種植各種糓類和蔬菜的田地。</p>
<p>現在，這個集體農塲已包含五百十八個經營，也就是除了富農以外這村的全部人口。牠有二百四十架農業用的機器和工具。集體農場的收入每年增加着：</p>

<h3>日本的幾種特殊婦女職業</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>在日本，婦女職業的種類是很多的，凡是從前祗有男人可以做的，現在大半都有她們加入其間。但是這裏我所要談的，是幾種特殊的婦女職業，這特殊並不是說在他們本國是特殊的，不過從、</p>
<p>我們貴國人看起來是特殊的吧了！</p>
<p>（一）ＡicGirl你們找遍各種英漢字典，或者亦找不出這字的定義來吧！這ＡirGirl是自從日本開始航行公共飛機以</p>
<p>來，應時而興起的新的婦女職業。他們的工作是在公共飛機内，管理乘客客一切事務。自然，這種工作，不是身體非常强健的女子，是不能夠勝任的。</p>
<p>（二）瑪納金　在宣傳方法已經發達的今日，不能怪日本的百貨商店老板們，感覺到那些木頭做的女偶像是不中用的了，因此，他們近來便利用活的人來替他們的貨品宣傳。這活的偶像日語稱爲瑪納金。她們的最大條件不用說就是美容，其次最需要的就是毅力了。一二小時，毫不動彈地坐在沉悶的ShowWindow裏面，不是平常人所能爲的呀！</p>
<p>（三）派出媂　派出婦的意義，有點和我國的女管事相近。因爲她們是從［主婦派出會］分派出來的，所以稱爲派出婦。派出婦的工作就是執行主婦的職務。她們以寡婦占大多數。派出婦的主顧大半是獨身者，所以這是很危險的職業。</p>
<p>此外尚有數種，因篇幅關係，兹從略。</p>

        <h1>1933.10.08</h1>
<h3>National Army Guards Mafang, Entered Ceasefire Yesterday, Fang Ji's Cavalry Estimated at Xiaotangshan, Ping Military Council Ordered to Stop Attack</h3>
<p>Fang Telegraphed, Asking to Settle His Subordinates, Personal Matters Not a Problem</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Ji's two units are now assembled in the area of Dafurenzhuang and Xiaofurenzhuang north of Gaoliying and Daxiaotangshan, in the area of Gaoliying and Daxiaotangshan. The National Army formation is in an inverted "人" shape. Fang Ji's two units are almost surrounded on three sides. The highest line of the National Army is north of Dongliucun, Xiaodongliucun, Xialangou, and Caoxinzhuang. Yesterday, small units of Fang Ji harassed from time to time, and were repeatedly repelled. Last night, near Tangshan, the National Army launched an assault towards Dafurenzhuang, engaging in fierce fighting with Fang Ji's units, and retreated to their original positions after 11 p.m. Today, they entered a state of ceasefire all day. Because Fang telegraphed He yesterday, expressing his willingness to leave the army and send representatives to Beiping for negotiations, the authorities are also willing to leave him a way out. Therefore, starting today, the Military Council ordered the front line to cease attacking. It is rumored that Wang Zhongfu arrived at Xiyuan last night, which remains to be confirmed. The person who arrived at Xiyuan was Xu Linchang, Fang's lieutenant colonel staff officer. Xu visited Zhu Hongxun's division in the Zhu Hongxun's camp yesterday, expressing Fang's willingness to leave the troops and requesting to maintain safety. Zhu sent someone that night to escort Xu to Xiyuan to see Wan Xiangchen. After Wan reported to the authorities, he sent an adjutant named Ma to Dafurenzhuang to meet Fang. He is expected to return tonight. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang's army's forward scouts, in groups of ten, made probing attacks on the National Army positions, targeting Mafang. Fang's army had three mortars. Last night, Fang Ji's army suddenly launched a coordinated fierce attack, from the banks of the Hulu River in Xing, Qincheng to Furenxinzhuang. The eastern route mutually supported each other at Daxiaodongliu and Daliushu. The enemy then changed tactics, using cavalry to detour around the positions of the 683rd Regiment's 67th Company. The 67th Company was at that time guarding the north gate of Tangshan City. Fearing being surrounded by the enemy, the entire line retreated and assembled at Mafang. Fang Ji's army then invaded Xiaotangshan City. The National Army then launched a full-scale assault, repelling the enemy. This afternoon, Niufang to Baishicun Lengkeng Baxianzhuang has become a parallel defense line. Fang is currently stationed at Nieying to command, and his rear forces are still moving towards the front. Fang Ji's army may launch another fierce attack south tonight. Mafang has become the front line. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Changping Telegram: On the 7th, at dawn, the fighting in Tangshan was quiet. Around 7 a.m., the weather between Shahe and Tangshan suddenly changed, with wind and rain. The fighting between the two sides ceased. Yesterday, the National Army once captured the positions along the Daliushu and Hulu River area, and then returned to their original positions, confronting the enemy. Last night, several hundred of Fang Ji's infantry and cavalry attacked our positions several times, and were all repelled. Wang Zhongfu previously sent representatives to contact the National Army for surrender, so many of Fang Ji's troops intend to surrender. The 130th Division captured many spies from Fang Ji's forces in the front. They secretly disguised themselves and infiltrated Changping, Shahe, and other places to scout our army's strength and movements, which is highly suspicious. As a result, the spies sent by the enemy in recent days have all been captured by the local garrison. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin's troops have entered Sihai from Yongningzhen in Chahar Province, with the vanguard reaching the Daxiaosangyuan area, claiming to cooperate with Fang Ji's army. When Fang's army attacked Changping on the 3rd of this month, a part of Tang's army participated. Tang's personal whereabouts have not yet been ascertained. Wang Ying, the commander of Fang's 4th Army, sent representatives to Zhu's division's defense zone yesterday, expressing his willingness to surrender to the National Army and formally break away from Fang's forces. Wang's unit has more than a thousand people and is currently stationed in Qincheng. Fang, because Wang is unstable, has sent troops to closely monitor him. Two Japanese planes flew to the Xiangtun Baishiqiao north area on the 6th at noon, dropping more than ten bombs, injuring four farmers and damaging one civilian house. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a forward scout report, Fang Zhenwu sent personnel to Huairou, formally notifying the Japanese army, stating roughly that he has withdrawn from the ceasefire zone and is currently starting to attack in a certain area. Our army aims to suppress [the enemy] to save the country, hoping that the Japanese army will not pursue and hoping that they will no longer send planes to bomb. On the 4th, Fang separately telegraphed He, expressing his willingness to hand over his weapons and hoping to be given a guarantee of safety. At the same time, Fang sent Xu Linchang with Fang's personal letter to Mafang to visit Zhu Hongxun, expressing his surrender. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Fang, seeing the military situation as unfavorable, has had the intention to repent and surrender. He recently telegraphed the military authorities here, asking for help to settle his subordinates, and stating that his personal whereabouts are not a problem. The authorities immediately telegraphed back, saying that if he has sincerity, he should immediately send responsible representatives to Beiping for negotiations. On the one hand, the front-line troops have also been notified to cease attacking from today to show leniency. It is thought that seeing the authorities' repeated accommodation, Mr. Fang may truly realize [his mistake] and send representatives to come for negotiations soon, handing over the troops to the Central Government. This matter can be expected to be resolved in the shortest possible time. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: After Fang Ji's remnant troops were repelled by our army in the Daxiaodongliu area, our army immediately implemented a plan to encircle and annihilate them. All areas of Datangshan, Xiaotangshan, Daliucun, Mafang, Shanglangou, and Xialangou have been successively recovered. Currently, the remnant bandits of that unit are gathered in Dafurenzhuang, Xiaofurenzhuang Huluhu, and Furenxinzhuang, occupying an area of less than ten li. The remnant troops number only over a thousand and have lost their fighting power. They will soon be annihilated. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mafang Telephone: Gaoliying and Dadongliu are currently garrisoned by the 684th Regiment. The enemy is active in the Shanglangou village area. The battle focuses on Mafang, where there has not been a fierce conflict. The Ping-Tang telephone line was just cut in Mafang. Today, workers from the telephone bureau went to repair it. Telephone communication is possible to Mafang. North of Mafang has not been repaired. Guan Linzheng's troops were ordered to advance to Taipingzhuang Lishuiqiao. The 146th Regiment arrived today. The line from Jiacun to Taipingzhuang is personally arranged for defense by Regiment Commander Zheng Mingxin. The defense is extremely solid. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Residents in the Huluhu area, because they are in the middle of the fierce fighting between the two armies, are easily hit by artillery fire and stray bullets. Therefore, most of the villagers closer to the front lines are panicking and have fled to Shahe and Beiping. Fang Ji's allied forces are currently stationed in Daliushu Village, Caoxinzhuang, Huluhu, Dafurenzhuang, Xiaofurenzhuang Xinzhuang, occupying an area of about fifteen li from north to south and over twenty li from east to west. Fang Ji is stationed at Nieying to command the army. Wang Ying leads his troops stationed in Qincheng. After Fang Ji's troops arrived in Tangshan, they began collecting flour and fodder this morning. Several grain stores in the area have been requisitioned by Fang's troops, enough to maintain the army's food supply for more than a month. After Fang Ji's allied forces occupied Tangshan, they actively built fortifications along Daxiaofurenzhuang Caoxinzhuang Daliushu Village to Daxiaotangshan, seemingly intending to defend. After the National Army guarded Tangshan, the defense line has been slightly adjusted, starting from Gaoliying in the east, along Daxiaodongliu, Xialangou, Mafang, Guanniuyu, Lengkeng, Baishe Village, to Changping, building a solid line. Division Commanders Zhu Hongxun and Zhou Fucheng are both commanding and arranging at the front line, determined to ensure safety. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain general talked about Fang Ji's army, Daxiaodongliu suddenly窜along both sides of the Hulan River, attempting to advance south. Our Zhu division intercepted them head-on with three regiments of troops, and used mountain artillery to cover them. At 3 p.m. on the 6th, about five or six hundred shells were fired at Daliushu. The enemy retreated westward along the entire line, using the bulk of their forces to detour around the Baishiqiao Mafang Houniufang area. Zhu's division retreated to the Mafang position on the front. At 5 p.m. on the 6th, 200 cavalry from Fang Ji's army rushed into Xiaotangshan. That night, they occupied Tangshan. This morning, a sentry battle occurred north of Mafang. The enemy sent a small number of scouts to scout our position. Liu Regiment Commander of the 685th Regiment in Mafang personally commanded at the foremost position. Wan Fulin received a telephone report at 12 o'clock, stating that the majority of Fang Ji's forces were temporarily assembled at Daxiaotangshan, sending scouts to our position from time to time, seemingly still having a large-scale offensive posture. Wan ordered the two division commanders, Zhou Fucheng and Zhu Hongxun, to firmly defend and not pursue. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Tingyao and Guan Linzheng went to the front to inspect at 7 a.m. this morning, arriving at Mafang and meeting with Division Commander Zhou Fucheng of Wan's unit, inquiring in detail about the situation at the front. They returned at 10 a.m., passing through Taipingzhuang Lishuiqiao Beiyuan and other areas, and inspected their troops.

<h3>Yang Kunru Also Died After Chen Jiongming</h3>

His mother, aged 66, heard the news on the 5th and was devastated. He has now been coffined and will be buried. (7th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Capital Ferry Test Run</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital ferry, Changjiang, has been assembled and the test run was successful and satisfactory. The Ministry of Railways is scheduled to hold a ferry opening ceremony on the morning of the 22nd of this month. If preparations are not completed in time, it will be postponed to the 29th. At that time, all Chinese and foreign directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund will come to Nanjing to attend the ceremony. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>China's Agricultural Products are One-Fifth Short</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain agriculturalist said that in recent years, special agricultural products have not been sufficient to meet needs, relying on foreign rice and foreign wheat. According to recent statistics, the total output of grains in our country is 215 million dan, of which rice accounts for about 100 million dan and wheat accounts for about 55 million dan, with the rest being sorghum, corn, millet, and other grains. The total amount of food needed nationwide is 293 million dan, a shortage of over 77 million dan compared to the output. Since September 18th, the puppet state of Japan has occupied the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol. The people in the four provinces are only over 30 million, but their grain output is over 24 million dan. Therefore, our country's food shortage is becoming more and more serious, with a total shortage reaching one-fifth. (7th Telegram)</p>

<h3>On Promoting Unified Control of the Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>— Reality</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the establishment of the National Economic Council, the most important point of attention was the unified control of the cotton industry. Therefore, the Cotton Industry Control Committee will be established imminently. According to a person in charge of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, the future will focus all efforts on the cotton production of Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces, while promoting water conservancy and improving planting, so that the cotton producing areas in the country can thrive and improve day by day. However, there has been no expression on how to specifically plan the cotton market. However, we believe that to speak of unified control, one must never independently control production without paying attention to the consumer market. Moreover, the American cotton and wheat loan regards cotton as a major commodity. There is no doubt that the consumer market should be given urgent attention. As for concentrating the nation's economic strength to coordinate the way out for the entire national economy, so that the declining and shrinking market of today can thrive and improve, and the masses who are generally hovering on the line of starvation can also settle into their occupations, the artificially stimulated prosperity will not fail. This is also the most practical and effective method for those who speak of controlling the economy.</p>
<p>Our country welcomes the technical cooperation of the League of Nations to expand the organization of the Economic Council. The goal of economic construction is certainly not limited to a certain industrial sector or paying attention to the prosperity of a certain part. The main sector of our country's industry is the textile industry, and the source of raw materials for the textile industry is primarily cotton. It is indeed an undeniable fact that the cotton industry should first seek a way out. However, when it comes to unified control of the cotton industry from the perspective of production, its main root is in the rural areas. From the perspective of consumption, its only way out is the yarn mills. At present, the rural areas are exhausted and the vitality is almost exhausted, and the future of yarn mills reducing working hours is also very dangerous. It can be seen that there is a need to find ways to save the situation. Now that the Cotton Industry Control Committee is paying attention to cotton production, if it can further pay attention to the path of consumption, then the future of the cotton industry will not be difficult to unleash a different brilliance. We will further consider the spinning industry.</p>
<p>The countries with backward industries, the first to develop are in the light industry. This is not only the case in our country but also in Japan. The difference is that the progress of our country's yarn mills took advantage of the situation during the European War. The situation is similar to speculative development. Although it is fast, the foundation of the industry is not stable. If it is in a period of global economic prosperity and when the domestic market sales are booming, the financial community is reassured to lend money, the industrial organization is expanded in an orderly manner, and the general society also has surplus capacity to engage in consumption, then this kind of practical good market can cover up the danger of speculation. However, our country's industry is originally very young. Speculation can only obtain temporary prosperity on paper, and the empty content is harmful to the future development. According to the investigation of those who know the inside story of our country's yarn industry, only three or five factories in the country's yarn mills can realistically work hard for the progress of the industry. Most of them devote all their efforts to speculative activities, ignoring their main business, so that once panic strikes and the market declines, the predicament will be immediately apparent, and even unable to maintain. Chinese capital has built about 2.5 million spindles in yarn mills across China. At this time, when the sales of cotton yarn are blocked and the rural economy is declining, if there is no way to save the situation, is the future not very dangerous?</p>
<p>Secondly, our country's yarn mills, if observed separately from each factory, seem acceptable. However, if we consider the situation of the entire spinning industry, we feel that it is unorganized. Although there is an organization of the Yarn Industry Federation, it has not been sound and cannot actually exert the power of its collective action. Comparing with the yarn mills set up by the Japanese in China, it is clear that the Japanese act consistently and the methods of opening up sales markets are agile, and the methods of using capital are ingenious. Therefore, within this same region, in terms of labor and raw materials, domestic factories should have priority convenience. The result is the opposite because the operators of Chinese yarn mills have neither been able to unite effectively nor do they know the needs of the domestic market, seeking a way out for the products of these mere 2.5 million spindles. This is why it is difficult to maintain and will collapse immediately.</p>
<p>If this continues, if there are no practical measures, I am afraid that the entire yarn industry will inevitably follow in the footsteps of the silk industry and fall into stagnation. If it comes to this, even with the government's backing, even if unified control is exercised, the future is not easy to be optimistic. Therefore, if we want to save the current emergency and eliminate future troubles, the unified control of the yarn industry should be implemented simultaneously with the unified control of the cotton industry. We must first fundamentally eliminate the drawbacks of speculation, break the habit of disunity, and concentrate our efforts on the operation of the yarn industry, deeply understand the needs of the rural areas, and then we can expect the development of the cotton industry.</p>
<h3>The Situation on the Chinese Eastern Railway is Treacherous. The Russian-Manchu Split is Imminent. Commerce in Harbin Stagnates.</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Various circles here are gradually convinced that the Russian and Manchu sides are gradually heading towards a rupture. The detention of Russian personnel on the Chinese Eastern Railway has caused serious developments. The Russian Consul General Slavsky made a fourth protest to the Bureau of Intercourse here yesterday, opposing the Manchu authorities' refusal to release the Russian personnel. The negotiator, Shi Luben, rejected the protest on the spot, saying that the detention of railway personnel was only a judicial matter. The Russian Consul General did not agree with this statement and requested that his protest be forwarded to Changchun, but Shi Luben remained unchanged in his attitude and argued for three hours. The Russian Consul General stood up and said, "I want you to inform Changchun of my protest." Shi replied, "This is not impossible, but this issue is ultimately judicial, not political." Banks here do not allow discounting or accepting drafts and promissory notes, and various circles expect that Russia and Manchuria may eventually split. Therefore, commerce in Harbin is currently quite bad. The general opinion is that the current situation is difficult to sustain. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Australia Excludes Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The British-Australian preferential tariff reduces taxes by 12.5% on 839 types of goods, while levying dumping duties on Japanese goods. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has therefore instructed Murai, the Japanese Consul General stationed in Sydney, Australia, to protest to the Australian government, citing the reason that Japanese goods will be subject to double disadvantage compared to British goods, and explaining that Japan purchases goods worth 134 million yen from Australia every year, while Australia only purchases Japanese goods worth 37 million yen. In comparison, Australia's surplus to Japan is about 100 million yen, so Japan is Australia's best customer. If Australia applies undue pressure to Japanese goods, Japan will inevitably take measures to cope with the new situation arising from this. The protest will also mention that Japanese business circles are now planning to purchase wool from South America and South Africa. It is said that if Australia is too coercive, there will be unfortunate consequences because the Japanese spinning industry will eventually stop purchasing wool from Australia due to the exclusion of Japanese goods.

<h3>Although Hirota Succeeded Uchida, the Diplomatic Policy Will Not Change. Araki's Talk to Japanese Reporters. Interior Minister Yamamoto Supports Takahashi's Position.</h3>
<p>(Utsunomiya) Minister of the Army Araki arrived in Utsunomiya on the morning of the 7th. After inspecting the reserve units of the 14th Division, he went to the garrison hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers of the Manchurian Incident. In the afternoon, he attended the National Defense Association and gave a speech on the current situation. Minister Araki said to reporters that the future of the Five-Minister Conference is still difficult. It is impossible to predict whether the national policy can be decided before the army exercises. The world believes that Foreign Minister Hirota, Finance Minister Takahashi, and the military have conflicting opinions on national policy issues. However, it is normal to discuss with each other when deciding national policy. Although Mr. Hirota succeeded Mr. Uchida as Foreign Minister, Japan's diplomatic policies towards China, Russia, and the United States will never be changed. Japan's foreign policy has already been decided after recognizing "Manchukuo" and withdrawing from the League of Nations. I did not announce the relationship between the national policy that I told the Finance Minister and the Five-Minister Conference, but the future and process of the Five-Minister Conference are very important. The United States is expanding its navy, so the relationship between Japan and the United States is considered to be sharp. The world expects Foreign Minister Hirota's mitigation policy, but it is most important to recognize the true attitude of the opponent. Between Japan and Russia, there is also the issue of a non-aggression treaty, which is also unknown. However, this is the same as the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, the fishery issue, etc., but it is a minor issue. The Russian side is concentrating its forces on the border, so the issue of a non-aggression treaty cannot be discussed unless it abolishes its military preparations. As for the China issue, we cannot urgently seek Sino-Japanese friendship because Hirota is the Foreign Minister. I believe that with domestic unity and solidarity, there is no need to fear foreign issues. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Hirota's Diplomatic Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the cabinet meeting on the 3rd and the cabinet meeting on the 6th, the government specially convened a meeting of the five ministers of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy to discuss the establishment of the highest national policy to open up the extraordinary situation. Foreign Minister Hirota explained the diplomatic policy, and the ministers of the Army Araki and Navy Osumi discussed the establishment of policies towards Russia and the United States. The content of the diplomatic policy advocated by the Foreign Minister is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The fundamental policy of general diplomacy is to implement it in combination with military affairs, and to negotiate diplomacy with the powers with the policy of establishing Japan's independent position in the Far East.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the policy towards Russia, Japan adopts the policy of resolving various pending issues between the two countries, but because the Soviet Russian state has special characteristics, it avoids concluding special non-aggression treaties and other forms of treaties to bind the positions of the two masters.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the policy towards China, the current state of Sino-Japanese relations has no major progress on the surface. The views that advocate direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, etc., are harmful and useless to the current state of Sino-Japanese relations. The policy towards China should also first resolve the pending issues at hand and gradually reach the point of opening up the overall situation.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the policy towards the United States, the relations between Japan and the United States are quite tense because the Second Washington Conference in 1935 is imminent. The policy towards the United States must alleviate such an urgent atmosphere and start political negotiations with the US government to realize the Pacific Peace Guarantee Agreement, in order to work for the smooth passage of the foundation in 1935. In addition, Japan and the United States exchanged national envoys to melt the feelings of the two peoples.</p>
<p>If this diplomatic policy of the Foreign Minister is approved by the Five-Minister Conference, it is planned to be presented to the Emperor and reported to Prince Saionji. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Tense Political Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Five-Minister Conference takes the decision of the national policy of each department as the theme of discussion. As a result of the first and second meetings, the cabinet members have very different opinions on the recognition of the current situation. Therefore, the deliberation could not proceed. If the Five-Minister Conference continues in this way, the compilation of the budget will encounter very difficult situations, and the political situation may have a major impact, which is unknown. (Dentsu News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At yesterday's Five-Minister Conference, opinions on issues related to national defense work could not be unified and were left to the next meeting. Finance Minister Takahashi's opinions on the enrichment of armaments by the military and his opinions on peaceful work have been gradually clarified. The core of the discussion is that Finance Minister Takahashi seeks armaments from the enrichment of national defense, while the other side has the view of the Foreign Minister's peaceful work, so he opposes the tax increase theory. It is extremely noteworthy whether the next meeting on Tuesday next week can see a compromise between Finance Minister Takahashi's peaceful opinions and the military's opinions on enriching armaments. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Takahashi-Araki Talk</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After yesterday's Five-Minister Conference, Finance Minister Takahashi told reporters that it was difficult to publish the content of the meeting, but the Five-Minister Conference will continue to be held several times in the future. Due to health reasons, I originally hoped to meet separately, but I did not get my wish, which is a pity. The theme of the meeting is diplomacy, but diplomacy cannot be achieved by clamoring. We must first take diplomacy as the first priority, and then establish a national defense plan in accordance with diplomacy. In my opinion, it will be difficult for the center of the meeting to make progress before the budget problem for the next fiscal year. In addition, Minister of the Army Araki told reporters that it is necessary to discuss where Japan will progress in the future and how Japan will be constructed. However, opinions differ on the current situation, which is recognized as the basis of national policy, so there is no progress. It is feared that it will be difficult to complete before the major exercise this autumn. If the abandonment of the naval disarmament treaty is notified at the Second Washington Conference in 1936, then this is the time to decide the policy. As for the national defense budget, the Army and Navy have their own independent positions in compiling it. (Dentsu News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Yamamoto Supports Takahashi</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Interior Minister Yamamoto went to Nagano and Niigata prefectures on the 7th to inspect local administration. The Interior Minister said in the car that the Army and Navy ministries have strong opinions on the budget for the next fiscal year. Although national defense is important, it is necessary to avoid things that irritate foreign countries. The military expenditure issue is currently being discussed at the Five-Minister Conference. The military authorities will definitely consider the state of finances and request military expenditure, so it is expected that this problem can be resolved satisfactorily.

<h3>Volunteer Army in Kailu Attacks Japanese Army Signal Corps</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Ikegami and others suffered heavy casualties</p>
<p>(Panyang) According to the Japanese Kwantung Army, 300 members of the volunteer army suddenly attacked the Japanese army signal corps on September 29. Lieutenant Ikegami and others on the Japanese side suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Kailu dispatched a garrison force on the 30th after receiving the news.

<h3>Two Japanese Warships Arrive in Hankou</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The new Japanese Deputy Consul, Taniuchi Taku, took office on the 7th. The warships "Futami" and "Toba" arrived in Hankou, and the warship "Hotsu" opened to Yichang. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Germany's Attitude Unchanged. Will Disarmament End in Failure? Germany's Reply Insists on Equality in Armaments. Former Allied Powers Must Disarm Immediately.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned here tonight that Germany has notified Britain, France, Italy, and the United States that if the Germans are granted complete equality in armaments, they will accept the arms supervision plan, but in any case, they cannot accept the trial supervision period proposed by the United States, but require a permanent solution. It is heard that the German government's intention is that it cannot be satisfied with allowing it to finally achieve equality in armaments or other conditions. If it wants it to accept the supervision plan, it will demand immediate equality. Its note was delivered to the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy tonight. It also solemnly stated the necessity of abolishing aggressive weapons, but it is heard that the way it is worded has suddenly changed opinions here on the prospects of the disarmament conference. Representatives of several countries claimed that France would definitely not accept it entirely. Although the Steering Committee will do its best to reconcile the opinions of all parties, it is expected that Germany's attitude will cause the disarmament conference to fail. According to the wording in the German note, the former Allied Powers must immediately begin to reduce armaments, and at the same time Germany may insist on consolidating its military position. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>A Great Upheaval Will Be Realized</h3>
<p>(Berlin) A senior German official declared today that Germany cannot accept a period of safe disarmament. The official also verified that the German Chargé d'affaires in London, Bismarck, had gone to the British Foreign Office to explain the attitude of the German government. It is now known that Germany's attitude on the main issues of disagreement that have arisen on disarmament has not changed. Germany insists on its demands on the issue of war materials, and still refuses to use four years as a transition period to test the new system of supervising armaments. During this period, the plan to maintain the current inequality of electricity preparation without any changes is still maintained. Germany advocates that once the disarmament convention is concluded, Germany should be supplied with all kinds of what the powerful countries of today call "self-defense or weapons", and all countries have agreed to retain this type of weapon to a limited extent in the future disarmament. Germany is not alarmed by changes in the situation. Its political and press circles say that a great upheaval is about to be realized, but Germany is not responsible for it. They also solemnly stated that Germany does not want to move armaments, but if other countries refuse disarmament, Germany must enjoy equal rights. Today's explanation given by Germany to Britain is that Britain had asked Germany something, and Germany answered it one by one. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is now known that Germany, in addition to requesting shortening the disarmament test period, also requested that substantial disarmament should begin before the end of the test period. Germany also asked to inform the exact extent of the disarmament prepared by the great powers in detail. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>France Is Very Displeased</h3>
<p>(London) France is particularly displeased because Germany did not notify France and Italy in advance and exchanged views on disarmament with Britain. The plan put forward by Germany may be slightly adversely affected as a result. The German Chargé d'affaires in London informed British Foreign Secretary Simon of Germany's views on the recent talks with the powers. Simon then extended his meeting with the French and Italian ambassadors to inform them of Germany's proposals. When the League of Nations holds a disarmament discussion next week, Germany will send its ambassador to Britain, Nadolny, as an attending representative. At that time, the delegations of various countries will discuss Germany's proposals. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Undersecretary Eden is scheduled to go to Geneva tomorrow morning, and Foreign Secretary Simon will follow on about October 10. The delegations of various countries in Geneva may not resume negotiations before the end of next week. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Pongou arrived here this morning and met with Baron Aloisi, the Italian representative to the League of Nations. Aloisi could not inform Pongou of the Italian government's formal opinion after receiving Germany's verbal reply on the disarmament issue from Rome. But he said that he would leave for Rome tonight and may return to Geneva again within the next week, but he must arrive by the time the General Disarmament Committee meets on October 16. At that time, he will be able to obtain the Italian government's complete instructions. Pongou intends to consult with Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, and Sato, the Japanese chief representative, this afternoon. Nadolny, the German representative to the Disarmament Conference, will arrive in Geneva on Sunday. As for the meeting of the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference, it is still scheduled to be held on Monday afternoon, but it has gradually become clear that this meeting will not have important political qualities. It is likely that the Presidium will only listen to the report of Chairman Henderson on all the circumstances since the Presidium adjourned, and then decide on the date for the General Committee to reconvene. This date is approximately as mentioned above and is set for October 16. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Different Views Between Britain and France</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The German government today announced its position on the main points of disarmament to the British and Italian governments. This is not a new proposal from Germany, nor is it a polite request, but a clear explanation of Germany's fundamental views. This has already been expressed in previous negotiations. The German note still advocates that it is necessary for the great powers with strong armaments to substantially reduce their armaments in accordance with the principle of equality of rights accepted by the powers, so that they can be close to Germany's current armament status; otherwise, Germany should be allowed to have the necessary weapons for self-defense. According to London news, the British government regards Germany's note as a possible basis for negotiation, but all sectors in France say that Germany's note is completely unacceptable. However, in any case, Germany's current move has eliminated any excuse for continuing to delay the disarmament negotiations. (National News, 6th) (Paris) Although the content of the German note has not yet been published, the discussions in the French newspapers are particularly tense. It seems that the note is completely of a rejection nature and cannot increase the hope of the Disarmament Conference. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Possible Changes</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the German Chargé d'affaires in Britain, Böttmicher, submitted the German opinions on the disarmament issue to the Foreign Office. Officials here seem to think that it is a statement of principle and may not have a definite nature. In other words, German opinions may change in the future discussions in Geneva. The general public said that although the German views and the original British disarmament plan are quite similar in general, this plan was only intended as a basis for discussion at the time, and most countries have put forward reservations, such as France also put forward a number of amendments, most of which have been accepted by Britain. This layer does not seem to be easier for the German counter-proposal to change, because once Britain accepts the German counter-proposal, it means retreating and re-submitting the old case, which the British government is unwilling to hear. In general, the international talks that have been out of order in recent weeks are to correct the original shortcomings of the British disarmament plan. This correction has already been approved by London and is an indispensable condition for the success of the disarmament convention. Now Germany is ignoring it, so it is inevitable that it will be criticized. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Several Countries Will Go Bankrupt</h3>
<p>(London) Baumann said at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham today that if Britain feels that its military quota is lower and other countries are higher, it should reduce the other country and increase ours until we are equal to each other. Britain is unwilling to participate in a disarmament convention in this way. Any country that violates the convention when signing it will be isolated and friendless in the civilized world. Any country that puts forward a request that may be accepted in the future but is difficult to accept today deliberately makes the convention impossible to be established. Baumann then issued a warning, saying that if Europe resumes competing in armaments, the salaries reduced in the past 30 years cannot be restored, it will be extremely difficult to reduce taxes, and several countries will go bankrupt as a result. Baumann finally stated the optimism held by Finance Minister Chamberlain, that is, British commerce is now better than any industrial country, and Britain's credit is consolidated and there is no risk of being destroyed. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>France's Defenses Are Consolidated</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French Radical Socialist Party held a congress in Vichy. This afternoon, when discussing the colonial issue, after heated debate, the vast majority rejected the French government's plan to build a railway across the Sahara Desert. According to the French government's plan, the road will be built in eight years, requiring approximately 375,000,000 francs each year. Although Congressman Esch of the party said that building roads can relieve unemployment, several other congressmen said that the country's current financial resources cannot afford this huge expenditure, and the result was rejected by the majority. Then the issue of national defense was discussed. Also, when the morning meeting was held, General Demero read a paper in praise of Daladier's armament policy, claiming that if the military expenditure is reduced again, the national defense will inevitably be harmed. As for the reduction of military expenditure, the number of standing troops and naval forces can be gradually reduced, and the air force can continue to be reorganized, and answered the opposition of the congressmen, saying that the consolidation of France's defenses is sufficient to resist any possible attack. Finally, a motion was passed, advocating that the maximum security must be obtained at the minimum cost. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>US Labor Unrest Subsides: 3 Million Return to Work, 75,000 Miners to Resume Work</h3>
<p>(Washington) General Johnson, Director of the National Recovery Administration, now anticipates that the 75,000 striking coal miners will soon return to work. Today, General Johnson rushed to the White House to meet with President Roosevelt. It is widely expected that the outcome will be President Roosevelt's personal intervention in the labor dispute. Before entering the White House, Johnson met with Pennsylvania Governor Pinchot, who came to seek peace in the coal industry. There have been reports of further strikes in several places, but no bloodshed occurred today. President Roosevelt has now increased the number of commissioners in the National Labor Board from seven to eleven to handle the work arising from the strikes. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to union reports, at least three million people had returned to work by the end of September. However, the higher wages paid have been offset by shorter working hours and higher prices. Since March of this year, production has increased by no less than 44%, while the public's purchasing power has only increased by 17%. A Federal Reserve Board bulletin stated that retail transactions in New York, Brooklyn, and Newark decreased by approximately 7% in September. A weekly report stated that trade progress was very slow, and President Roosevelt has instructed Agriculture Secretary Wallace to expedite cotton farmer loans. The Textile Industry Research Institute announced today that 145,000 workers have been re-employed in the textile industry, and the total wages are now more than double what they were in March of this year. Steel mills have complained to the government that a fixed price of $35 per ton for steel rails would cause losses to the steel mills but they will endeavor to accept it in order to promote work. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt announced tonight the immediate establishment of a commodity credit corporation with an initial capital of three million dollars. The corporation may borrow from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Farm Credit Administration using commodities as collateral. The primary task of the corporation is to fulfill the government's promise to lend to cotton farmers at a rate based on six cents per pound of cotton, in order to raise cotton prices.

<h3>British Labour Party Conference: Adopts Socialism, Rejects Cooperation with Communists, Supports Immediate Self-Determination for India</h3>
<p>(London) At the Labour Party conference held in Hastings, the party openly adopted socialism. The Executive Committee accepted a proposal from former Attorney General Cripps to consider and report next year, thus avoiding a split within the Labour Party. Cripps' proposal included the abolition of the House of Lords, and the passage of the Emergency Powers Act, which authorizes the government to implement any plan by order. The nationalization of banks and the requirement for the cabinet to consult with the Labour Party on important matters were also unanimously passed today. However, the proposal for sympathetic cooperation with the Communist Party was rejected, with only support for seeking closer relations with Soviet Russia. The conference also passed a resolution guaranteeing workers full management rights in socialized enterprises. This move overturns the decision of the Trades Union Congress and is further evidence of the Labour Party's prevention of union domination. One speaker likened British imperialism in India to Hitlerism, which caused considerable dissent, but a motion for immediate self-determination for the Indian people was ultimately passed with cheers.

<h3>Street Fighting Erupts in Ireland: Blue Shirt Leader Injured, de Valera's Supporters Back Current Government, Troops Patrol to Prevent Further Disturbances</h3>
<p>Tralee: Supporters of Irish Executive Council President de Valera tonight assaulted General O'Duffy, leader of the Blue Shirts, inflicting serious injuries. Subsequent street fighting with military police has raised fears of a serious situation. O'Duffy was en route to an Irish United Party meeting here when a mob ambushed him, dragging him from his car and beating him severely. Although O'Duffy resisted and fled, he eventually reached the meeting place, but was covered in blood, his face bruised, and his clothes torn. The mob, seeing O'Duffy gone, then smashed his car and set it on fire, before marching in formation to attack the meeting place, throwing stones through the windows. The police were unable to stop them, and they were about to break into the meeting place when troops dispatched from Cork and Limerick arrived just in time. They immediately launched tear gas, causing the mob to retreat slightly. However, they launched a second attack moments later, whereupon the troops were ordered to use bayonets to disperse them. The mob shouted slogans supporting President de Valera and denouncing O'Duffy as a traitor throughout. Afterward, the troops entered the meeting place to escort O'Duffy to a safe location. Troops are currently patrolling the streets to prevent further disturbances. (National Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Will Spain Restore Dictatorship? New Government Unable to Form, Socialist Party Prepares for Action</h3>
<p>Madrid: Marañón has been unable to form a new government because the Socialist Party refused to dissolve Parliament. It is rumored that the Socialist Party will organize armed forces to implement a "Diek Tuito" system in Spain. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid: President Zamora has been unable to resolve the political crisis caused by the resignation of the Lerroux government through other means and is now considering combining various governments into a "National Harmony Government." Betegala, leader of the Independent Republican Party and former Minister of Finance under the monarchy, has declined to serve as the new premier. However, Marañón has informed the President that he will attempt to form a National Harmony Cabinet. Although the Lerroux government has resigned, it is still temporarily in charge of affairs. The Socialist Party is currently using "Revolution to the End" as its slogan, according to the party's leader, former Prime Minister Azaña. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Madrid: After Betegala abandoned his attempt to form a cabinet, the President of Spain specially invited Dr. Marañón to take over this afternoon. Marañón accepted the mandate to form a new cabinet on the condition that a national compromise cabinet be organized. Marañón is a scientist and highly regarded in the country, not affiliated with any political party. He achieved outstanding merit during the revolution and was once a candidate for president. Therefore, political circles believe that at this time, it would be easier to bring things together if Marañón came out to form a new cabinet. (National Telegraph, 6th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Interior Revises Methods for Using Temple Property for Public Welfare</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a survey by the Ministry of Interior, there are more than 100,000 temples in various provinces of China. Temples with larger properties have annual surpluses, which are managed and distributed by the presiding monks, resulting in useless consumption. In view of the successive years of natural disasters in various places, the Ministry of Interior plans to extract a portion of the temple property surplus to carry out public welfare and charitable undertakings such as education and disaster relief. Methods were formulated, but due to manipulation by local bullies, many disputes arose. Recently, in view of the increasing disasters, the government's allocation of funds for relief can only maintain the current situation. Therefore, it is planned that local organization committees will investigate the surplus property of local temples and carry out various public welfare and charitable undertakings. The handling methods are currently being studied, and the previously formulated methods are being revised. They will be submitted to the relevant ministries and commissions for review soon and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and the Ministry will order various places to begin handling the matter.

<h3>Zhangjia's Envoy Reassures the Mongol Banners: Departing from Wutai Mountain to Beiping, Discussing Border Defense with Yan in Taiyuan</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The newly appointed Mongol Banner Envoys Zhangjia Fotu Kutu has resided for a long time in the Wutai Mountains of Shanxi province. The religious district under his jurisdiction covers the provinces of the Northeast, as well as Chahar, Suiyuan, Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia. The Central Government, in order to comfort the Mongol banners in the aforementioned provinces has specifically ordered Zhang to organize the Mongol Banner Consolidation Envoy Office in order to realize the goals of the consolidation and unification of the country and strengthening border defense. After receiving his orders, Zhang then ordered Li Jianzhang, head of the Beijing office, to lead several tens of staff to Beiping to ensure that the office could be organized. Li recently came to Taiyuan to make a report to Zhang after visiting the Wutai mountains. Zhang, eager to set out on the consolodation effort, then departed on the 30th of September from the mountains, arriving in Taiyuan with more than 30 staff. Yan Xishan especially dispatched General Zhu Shouguang, chief of staff of the pacification headquarters, along with Guo Xiangmin, head of public relations of the pacification headquarters, Li Diao, head of the military police command, and Cheng Shurong, head of the security bureau, to greet him outside the North Gate. After Zhang arrived at the city walls he went to the Yangzheng Hotel, with his entourage including palace Shushi, head of the publicity department of the consolidation office, secretaries Li Wentai, Cang Weigu, Chenda Lama, Mongolian-Han bridge officer Xi Zengge, and lieutenant colonel adjutant Bao Rongting. According to Li Wentai and Xi Zengge, Zhang was eager to set off to console and settle the Mongol banners after receiving his appointment, but the consolidation office organizational charter and other matters were not yet approved by the Central Government, so the travel dates were delayed. Currently the organizational charter has been approved, and the consolidation office has already been organized, so he departed from Wutai Mountain, planning to not delay in Taiyuan, and after arriving in Beiping, he will promptly manage the affairs of the envoy office before setting off on the consolidation effort. It is counted that the religious district under his jurisdiction covers a total of 6 leagues and 28 banners. The three Eastern leagues of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have already fallen into chaos, so he will not travel there. The area for this round of consolidation will be the three Western leagues, as well as the Alashan banner, and 27 banners of Qinghai. Because the weather is already growing colder, it will be inconvenient to drive before the arrival of the Great Cold, so he must return to Beiping. It is heard that Yan Xishan will host a banquet for Zhang at the pacification headquarters tonight and coordinate on the important affairs of the Mongol border defense. Zhang is scheduled to go to Beiping the day after tomorrow. (October 2)</p>
<h3>Communist Areas to Be Completely Blockaded: Final Decision at High-Level Military Conference, Communist Areas to Shrink Due to Advances of Various Armies</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Chiang had previously decided to blockade the Communist areas and cut off all supplies to the Communist masses in order to control their fate. Therefore, he specifically ordered the commanders-in-chief, general commanders, and commanders of various columns to divide their respective defense areas into three types of zones. Areas completely occupied by the Communists, such as Ningdu, Xingguo, Yudu, Ruijin, Jinshicheng, and Huichang counties, are called full Communist areas. Areas with frequent Communist disturbances, such as Yongfeng, Yihuang, Le'an, Lianhua, Yiyang, and Tonggu counties, are called semi-Communist areas. Areas adjacent to the Communist areas, such as Ganzhou, Ji'an, and Pingxiang, are called adjacent Communist areas. Areas with no Communist disturbances, such as Nanchang, Xinjian, and Jiujiang counties, are called safe areas, in order to handle blockade matters separately. The methods, apart from allowing free trade in all safe areas as usual, require all transportation, sale, and purchase of daily necessities, military supplies, and medicines in adjacent and semi-Communist areas to have permits approved by the highest local military authorities before they can be released; otherwise, they will all be detained. Goods transported from safe areas to adjacent and semi-Communist areas will be sold publicly by public sales committees organized by local public law associations. People will purchase goods based on their good citizen certificates, with each person allowed to purchase three to five qian of blue cloth per day. For other items such as kerosene, the amount purchased per household will be determined by the number of people in the household. As for full Communist areas, all postal, telecommunications, and transportation will be completely blockaded, and any and all material supplies will be cut off. The above blockade matters will be managed by local county governments, with local military commanders responsible for supervision and political training personnel for inspection. In order to strictly enforce the plan, the General Headquarters will divide the entire province into eight districts and send personnel to inspect and guide them separately to prevent local perfunctoriness that would hinder the important blockade policy. According to military sources, the General Headquarters originally believed that the Communist areas were vast, so it specifically blockaded those that could be effectively blockaded. Currently, the deployment of troops on all fronts is nearing completion, and all combat plans have been finalized at various levels of military conferences. After the general mobilization, the semi-Communist areas can be gradually cleared, and the full Communist areas can also be gradually recovered. The previously demarcated areas will also be revised at any time as military advances are made, so that adjacent Communist areas become safe areas and semi-Communist areas become adjacent Communist areas. In this way, the Communist areas will shrink day by day, and when they shrink to the smallest possible extent, the area will be limited, and the blockade will be easier. At that time, a general blockade will be launched to ensure that the Red Communists receive no supplies whatsoever, and the Communist atmosphere can be completely eliminated. (October 6)</p>
<h3>He Jian Reports on the Communist Army and Its Economy: Red Bandit's Land and Water Transportation Lines Have Failed, Economic Panic and All Sources of Supply Cut Off, Military and Civilians Should Work Together to Exterminate the Bandits</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian reported on the recent situation of the Red Bandits and pointed out the direction of civilian assistance in suppressing the bandits during the expanded memorial week in Pingxiang on September 25. The main points are as follows:</p>
<h3>Status of Red Bandit Armies</h3>
<p>According to recent surveys, the Communist army in Southern China has five army corps, reorganized as six military regions, claiming to have more than forty divisions. Their distribution is as follows: Lin Biao's First Army Corps and Dong Zhentang's Fifth Army Corps are in Eastern Jiangxi. Chen Yi's Jiangxi Military Region and Xiao Jinguang's Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region are on the southeastern front. Tang Zaigang's Zhejiang-Jiangxi Military Region is in Northeastern Jiangxi. Kong Hechong's Sixth Army Corps and Cai Huiwen's Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army are in Western Jiangxi. Zhang Shouyi's Hunan-Jiangxi Military Region is in Southern Hubei. Peng Dehuai's Third Army Corps and Luo Binghui's Fujian Military Region are in Western Fujian. He Long's Second Army Corps is in Western Hubei. There are also small groups of bandits distributed between the provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Fujian, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. This is a general overview of the current state of the bandit army. In recent months, due to our army's attacks from the north, south, and west, part of them has invaded Fujian, aiming to seize the coast of Fujian in order to make sea transport to open an international route to obtain military, political and economic relations with Soviet Russia to remedy Xu Xiangqian's previous policy of opening an international route through Shaanxi, Gansu, and Mongolia. However, after the bandit army invading Fujian was met and severely defeated by our 19th Route Army on the southern route, it is now in a state of collapse, so its policy of trying to create a sea transport route to obtain international ties has also failed. The bandits are at the end of their rope, and their elimination is not far off. Also, recently, the fake 17th and 18th Divisions advanced towards Xiangshui in Hunan, and were severely defeated by our 15th and 56th Divisions in the Meihua Mountain, Getian, and Dalong areas, killing more than 1,000 bandits and seizing more than 600 guns and two machine guns, and capturing many prisoners. In addition, our 3rd Column in Southern Hubei engaged in a fierce battle with the fake Red 3rd Division, which was disrupting Yangxin and Datian, resulting in the death of the fake division commander Xiao Gaowei, the fake political commissar Ye Jinbo, and the injury of the fake chief of staff and the commanders of the 79th and 2nd Regiments. Also, more than 600 bandits were killed. These two battles were the larger battles since the start of our western route army, and it can be seen that the strength of the bandits is weak and unable to withstand a single blow.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The 56th and 2nd Divisions severely defeated them in the Meihua Mountain, Getian and Dalong areas, killing over a thousand bandits and capturing over 600 guns, 2 machine guns, and many prisoners. Additionally, our Third Column of Hubei fought fiercely in the tenth month in Southern Hubei fought fiercely against the fake Red Third Division which disrupted Yangxin and Datian, resulting in the death of the fake Division Leader Xiao Gaowei, the fake Political Commissar Ye Jinbo, the fake Chief of Staff and the commanders of the 79th and 2nd Regiments, and the death of over 600 bandits. These two events were the larger battles of our Western Route Army after the start of actions, it is apparent that the forces of the bandits are feeble and unable to withstand a single blow.</p>
<h3>Economic Conditions in Communist Areas</h3>
<p>Since the onset of communist control, the people in the communist areas have neglected production and only know how to consume. Plagues are rampant everywhere, leading to daily economic bankruptcy. Sources of income have been cut off, and the situation is dire, making it difficult to survive. Therefore, the puppet government resorts to various cunning schemes, squeezing every ounce of wealth from the people without any reservation, in order to seek relief. It is reported that their methods are fivefold: (1) Forcing soldiers and civilians to return paper money. A notice from the puppet Southeastern Hubei Soviet Finance Department stated that the puppet hospital in the rear, various factories, and organs need more than 35,000 yuan per month. The original plan was for each county to provide funds, but due to limited finances, they cannot allocate the funds. They temporarily alleviate the urgent need by issuing paper money through the puppet bank. However, the circulation of this paper money increases daily, causing more pain to the soldiers and civilians in the communist areas. Later, the puppet finance department decided to force the recovery of all issued paper money without redemption. All counties and military and political organs in the communist areas were ordered to recover a certain amount each month, with penalties for violators. (2) Suspending the disbursement of funds. Because the puppet government cannot sustain the expenditure, it decided to suspend the disbursement of funds to various organs and troops for July, August and September. During these three months, all organs and troops are to implement a self-sufficiency campaign. The method is for the police, assault divisions, guerrilla teams, short-gun teams, etc., of various organs to actively loot grain and money from our peaceful areas, and engage in kidnapping, in order to survive. (3) Reducing food expenses. The food allowance for all staff in the communist areas was originally set at three cents per person per meal, but is now reduced to two cents across the board to save expenses. (4) Levying progressive taxes. Those with capital within 100 yuan are taxed 4 yuan per month, and those with more than 100 yuan are taxed more according to a progressive method. In addition, there are agricultural progressive taxes and commercial progressive taxes, etc., countless extortionate levies. (5) Replacing deposit certificates with war bonds. The deposit certificates of the puppet bank, deposited by soldiers and civilians in the communist areas last year, were originally scheduled to be redeemed this year. However, due to economic difficulties, these deposit certificates have been converted into war bonds, with a one-year extension. It is claimed that the puppet Southeastern Hubei Soviet Finance Department is responsible for repayment, but in reality, it is just another trick to swindle the people's wealth.</p>
<h3>Three Methods to Annihilate the Communists</h3>
<p>Based on the above situation, we already know that the communists are becoming increasingly broken down in both military and economic terms. We should seize this opportunity to implement the following three methods, which will be sufficient to thoroughly annihilate the remaining bandits: (1) Military-civilian cooperation. The relationship between the military and the people is like that between husband and wife, and there should be no disturbance or conflict. Instead, they should help each other and depend on each other for survival, like intertwined branches. The people should also do their best to help the military. The two should work together, which will be more effective. Moreover, our military is the armed force of the people. The military does not avoid hardship or fear death, and fights with the communists for the welfare of the people. Therefore, the people should provide the military with convenience in every way, such as reporting communist activities, assisting with supplies, checking household registration, and uniting for self-defense, in order to boost military morale and not act as eyes and ears for the communists, or act as vanguards, laundry teams, cooking teams, or comfort teams, etc., all of which are beneficial to the military to promote the communists' demise. (2) Upholding justice. It goes without saying that the people in the areas ravaged by the bandits are suffering. Even those in areas that have suffered less are also in great difficulty. Shameless local tyrants have lost all conscience and, in the name of suppressing bandits, engage in exploitation, enriching themselves at the expense of the villagers. The things that the government has ordered to be done are generally nominal and ineffective, and instead of benefiting the people, they burden them. They even frame the good and reject the just, which is extremely hateful. If there are such scoundrels in the future, the people should expose them, and our department will severely punish them. However, false reports are not allowed, otherwise, the accusers will be punished with the same crime. This will clarify right and wrong, ensure protection, and eliminate the bad elements. Only then can local public welfare be fully promoted, and social stability can be predicted. (3) Economic blockade and economic destruction. As mentioned above, the economic panic in the communist areas has reached its extreme. We can now surround them, shrinking their scope day by day, and use economic blockade policies to cut off their external transportation. No matter grain, rice, oil, salt, vegetables, medicine, or money, everything should be prohibited from entering. The most important thing is to prevent the communists' enticements. For example, the communist areas are short of salt, which has become expensive like pearls. Many greedy merchants secretly transport salt into the area, which is the most heartbreaking thing. If such a thing happens in the future, once discovered, the perpetrators will be executed. All of our people should pay close attention. (September 30)</p>
<h3>British Merchants Monopolize Tungsten Mining, The Ministry of Industry Loses Huge Profits, Various Circles in Jiangxi Province Express Their Firm Opposition, Chiang Kai-shek Has Emailed the Ministry of Industry to Cancel the Contract</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Tungsten is one of the basic elements of metal chemistry and is a rare and valuable metal with a wide range of uses. For example, when combined with carbon, its hardness is extremely high and can be used as filaments in light bulbs. When mixed into steel, it is called tungsten steel, which can cut high-temperature objects that steel drills cannot. Other examples include bullets and gun barrels, all of which use its alloys. However, the manufacturing method is very difficult, and among the industrially advanced countries, only the United States and Germany can refine pure tungsten.</p>
<p>Gannan and the border of Guangdong are rich in tungsten production, accounting for 60% of the world's total output. Tungsten mines were discovered in the fourth and fifth years of the Republic of China, and business flourished in the sixth and seventh years of the Republic, with an annual output of 180,000 dan, worth more than 12 million yuan. After the European War, sales declined sharply. By the tenth year of the Republic of China, it had returned to its former glory, with a production volume of 110,000 dan. After the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, due to Gannan becoming a nest of red bandits and the world's economic downturn, this output almost disappeared. This year, Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, signed a contract with the British firm Jardine Matheson, granting them complete management and exclusive sales of all tungsten ore in Gannan. Various circles in the province and counties in Gannan believed that this matter would cause great losses to the livelihood of the people in Gannan and the interests of the nation. They telegraphed their opposition and repeatedly petitioned the Central Government, the National Government, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting that the Ministry of Industry be ordered to cancel the contract with the British firm. The dispute lasted for two months. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek pointed out that the contract signed by the Ministry of Industry with the British firm for the exclusive export of tungsten ore is related to the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of miners in Gannan and the national defense industry. He specifically telegraphed Chen Gongbo to change the method of handling this matter or cancel the original contract and have the central government take over the management, so that both national planning and people's livelihood can benefit. At the same time, he also ordered Chairman Xiong to telegraph the Ministry of Industry to inquire about the contents and process of the contract signed with the British firm, as well as the output of tungsten ore in Gannan, etc., for reporting and verification. Tungsten is an important element in the metal industry and the national defense industry and cannot be compared to ordinary products. (October 2)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Conducts a Massive Search for Dissenters, Detaining More Than 100 People in Ten Days, The Public Security Bureau Has Executed Nine People by Firing Squad, Employees of the Mechanical Workers' Union Have Also Been Arrested</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Chen Jitang ordered a massive arrest of dissidents, there have been continuous arrests every night. Therefore, the state of emergency has not yet been lifted. From mid-September to the present, the Public Security Bureau and the Gendarmerie Headquarters have arrested more than 100 people, most of whom are current employees of various institutions and students with higher education. Therefore, in order to prevent any changes in military and political institutions, Chen has implemented an emergency curfew. After dark, the locations of the institutions, such as Weixin Road, Guangren Road, Guangwei Road, Yuehua Road, Dexuan Road, Mangguoshu Street, Houxiang Road, Liantang Road, and Xiaobei Road at the foot of Guanyin Mountain, are patrolled by gendarmes and squads. Around 10 o'clock, all passing cars and handcarts must be checked. After 12 o'clock, pedestrians are not allowed to pass without a password. As for Nantang, Dongshan, Meihua Village, Yantang, Shahe, Dongsha Road, and other places, students and teachers from military and political schools are dispatched to patrol and guard. The southern area is guarded by the defense army. Major hotels, small and medium-sized inns, theaters, opium dens, clubs, and entertainment venues in the prosperous areas of the city are all closely searched by the Gendarmerie and the Public Security Bureau. As soon as there is suspicion, they will be interrogated. On the evening of September 24, a man was arrested at the China Shadow Play Theater in the city. He was a student from a certain university, surnamed Zhang, but his first name is unknown. He is currently being held in the Gendarmerie Headquarters. According to official reports, the reactionaries are organizing a certain society in the city, with the purpose of organizing the members who are mostly university graduates, numbering dozens of people. Furthermore, the Gendarmerie recently uncovered an organization in a Western-style building on Fengning Road, arresting the head of the organization and seizing a list of members. Most of the members are active personnel in the military, political, and academic circles. Therefore, the authorities were able to arrest them according to the list, and no one escaped. It is said that there are five teams of reactionaries, operating in different directions. Most of those arrested this time belong to the second team of members. He Luo, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally interrogated the arrested persons and forbade outside inquiries and newspaper reports on the facts. It is estimated that the Public Security Bureau has detained about 70 people in the past ten days. On the evening of September 26, the Public Security Bureau executed nine people by firing squad who were found to have committed serious crimes after clear interrogation. It is reported that He Yilu, the commander of the Jiangda warship who was previously detained, and Lian Bingzhang, a major general and advisor to the headquarters, have been released, while one account states they are still being held.</p>
<p>Since Chen Jitang started the party prison, the precautions have been extraordinary. He not only guards against political enemies, but also closely guards against members of the Mechanical Workers' Union, who are close to him. Because the union was reorganized last month, the radical elements of the union have developed animosity with the government and vowed to retaliate. In order to prevent assassination, party and government officials have paid special attention to the actions of the union members. It was recently learned that the union members plan to hold a demonstration on Double Ten Day. Yesterday, Chen had someone arrest the former leader of the union's disciplinary team. Chen's mansion in Meihua Village held another meeting on the 26th, attended by military and political figures. After discussion, it was generally decided to task the teaching division, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital with seriously arresting dissidents. Several confidential items were also decided, but it is impossible for outsiders to find out. On the 27th, Chen also convened a discussion meeting with the leaders of various trade unions in the city, instructing the trade unions to assist in the arrest of members of the Mechanical Workers' Union, and stipulating rewards to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Economic Panic in Chaozhou and Shantou, Due to the Collapse of Rural Areas Affecting Cities, Yuan Dacheng and Maocheng Banks Suddenly Close, The Credit of Paper Money and Blank Receipts is Shaken</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The economic panic and financial exhaustion in Shantou have been going on for a long time. Tracing back to its distant cause, it began in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, when the commercial and industrial sector of Southeast Asia was affected by the decline. The number of unemployed overseas Chinese returning home is increasing. In the past, overseas Chinese remitted about 50 million yuan back to their hometowns every year. This cash passed through Shantou, and the silver industry used this capital as working capital. The purchasing power of rural areas also increased as a result. This was the past active financial situation of Chaozhou and Shantou. After the twentieth year, the number of returned overseas Chinese increased. Those who created profits have become those who shared profits. In addition, places such as Siam, Annam, and Singapore restricted the entry of Chinese workers and collected Chinese import taxes. Everyone who went abroad needed to prepare 200 to 300 yuan for travel expenses. Therefore, the young people of Chaozhou and Meizhou had no way out in terms of life and economy. In the past, about 150,000 people went abroad to make a living through Shantou every year, but last year it decreased to more than 20,000 people. The actual social situation turned into a tragic situation of a small number of people producing food for a large number of people. As a result, the economy of Chaozhou and Shantou completely collapsed. In recent years, various industries and businesses have been burdened by donations and taxes and have completely withered and gone bankrupt. For example, several well-known canned food manufacturing industries, such as Shiwei Company, have been forced to shut down and go bankrupt due to heavy taxes on foreign sugar. The vegetable sauce and oil industry also failed because blue dye was expensive and could not be transported to other cities for sales. This year, the prices of Chaozhou and Shantou vegetables and green fruits are very cheap, and the workers who have lost their jobs go without saying. Moreover, the donations and taxes are so complicated that not only is there a donation for everything, but there are also several donations for one thing, with layers of exploitation. This year, there was a drought in spring and autumn, and farmers could not eat after plowing. Before the grain could be harvested, they were urged to pay money and food, field taxes, field donation, district and township public offices self-government fees, guard fees, and all the committee members, grain officials, and clerks all stepped into the rural areas to demand money. Not only could the farmers not get enough to eat, but they were also in debt because of plowing. Those in the rural areas were full of sorrow, and those who had not entered the rural areas mistakenly believed that the cheap grain hurt the farmers. Therefore, they held a foreign rice tax in order to promote the sale of domestic rice. If they were to conduct a thorough investigation in the rural areas, then there would be no way to talk about cheap grain. The rural areas of Chaozhou and Meizhou have never had grain. In years of good harvests, it is not enough to eat for three months, let alone this year, which is a year of famine. The sales of foreign rice have penetrated deep into the mountain villages of Fujian and Jiangxi, and the scorched state of the rural areas can be imagined. The bankruptcy of rural areas has affected the commerce and finance in the cities. This is why Shantou's economy is in extreme panic.</p>
<p>The current dullness of commerce in Shantou is rare since the opening of the port. Major companies have few customers. The flags of big sales are flying in front of the doors of various stores. The more stable merchants are doing their best to tighten their belts to maintain the current situation. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, dozens of large banks and commercial firms closed down in succession, and more than 200 closed down on their own. In various counties and towns of Chaozhou and Hui, the total number of closed stores was no less than 1,000. At that time, the Municipal Business Association, the Exchange Silver Industry Association, and other organizations urgently sought relief and decided that all maturing drafts and deposits would be half-received and half-transferred, with a uniform interest rate of 1.5 cents per day for same-day loans and 2 cents per day for overnight loans. They also issued blank receipts jointly guaranteed by various banks (100 yuan per receipt) and blank receipts guaranteed by property to overcome the difficulties. It is estimated that the silver industry and exchange banks issued more than 1.3 million yuan in blank receipts. Originally, Shantou commonly needed 6 million yuan in cash, with cash accounting for two-thirds and paper money accounting for one-third. Since the continuous public debt apportionments and various taxes surged, cash was invisibly flowing into the provincial treasury. The amount of cash in the market was very short. The government initially stated that it would maintain finance and ordered people to ban the export of cash, with no more than 20 yuan allowed per person. The Shantou branch of the Provincial Bank issued 1 million yuan in local banknotes and held property mortgage loans, and also held the sale of certificates. Merchants paid 50% in cash and another 50% in property guarantee, and they bought banknotes and used them on the market. However, the Shantou branch of the Provincial Bank absorbed more and more cash, and the warehouse could not accommodate it. During the period of prohibiting the export of silver, a large amount of cash was transported to the province for storage, which once aroused questions from the Municipal Business Association. Under these circumstances, the cash in Chaozhou and Shantou became increasingly exhausted, heading straight for an irreversible situation. The blank receipts issued by the banks were originally for a period of two months and should have been recovered as scheduled in August. When the Exchange Association decided to recover them, Yongda and other banks were unable to make ends meet due to this reason, which led to their closure. Therefore, the banks decided to extend the period to the end of the lunar year and then recover them after the establishment of the public treasury. During this period, the banks continued to issue blank receipts. Since these blank receipts had no redemption date, it was difficult to buy and sell for each 100 yuan on the market. The post office, the Bank of China, the Provincial Bank, and the Savings Association all refused to accept them. The credit of blank receipts was not established, and the credit of bank paper money was also affected at the same time. Therefore, Shantou became a world of paper money and blank receipts before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>There is no fundamental remedy for Shantou's finance. Moreover, the annual trade deficit of more than 10 million taels of customs duties proves that this cash outflow is rolling outward incessantly. The large amount of public debt apportioned by the provincial government and the national tax revenue continue to absorb money from the people and turn it into military funds, instead of using it for profit-making and relief projects. How can the financial future not collapse? Therefore, before the Mid-Autumn Festival, banks such as Chen Yuanda and Chengmao suddenly closed down. Chen Daonan, the chairman of the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, also quietly went to Shanghai. It was found that Yuanda Bank was a giant in the silver industry of the Chaoyang gang in the Exchange Association and had held the financial center of the business community for many years. The impact of this closure was very significant. Zhou Yusheng, the general manager of Yuanda Bank, had established Chengmao Heji Bank in Yongxing, which also closed down at the same time. It is estimated that Yuanda Bank owed 225,000 yuan in paper money and 50,000 yuan in blank receipts, and Chengmao owed 75,000 yuan in paper money and 47,000 yuan in blank receipts. Before this rumor spread, various merchants went to withdraw their money. Even the friend Li Hengqu acted as a guarantor to rescue them and raised a total of 130,000 yuan, but still could not maintain it. After the closure of Yuanda Bank, the credit of all banks' blank receipts and paper money was greatly shaken. The Municipal Business Association specially held a general meeting of members and decided that Ma Hefeng should first propose 400,000 yuan to recover the paper money and blank receipts of the two banks. The Yuanda property would be auctioned off in six months to repay the debt. Before the repayment, the monthly interest would be one cent. Due to the closure of Yuanda Bank, the Business Association had 150,000 yuan in public funds and also owed more than 100,000 yuan from Jieqian, which could not be liquidated. Because General Manager Zhou Yusheng had fled with important books and documents in advance, and the important staff in the store had also dispersed. This is a death knell for the total collapse of the silver industry in Shantou. If there is still no fundamental relief legislation, the situation around the Winter Solstice and the Lunar New Year will be even more unimaginable. (September 30)</p>
<h3>Financial Difficulties in Fujian Province, Government Expenses for Various Agencies Are Only Issued for Half a Month, Military Expenses in September Are 30,000 Yuan Short, The Expenses of Provincial Schools Are in Arrears for Two Months, Many Stores Have Closed Down in Fuzhou City</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the reorganization of the provincial government at the end of last year and the appointment of Fan Qiwu as the director of the finance department, the financial situation of Fujian Province has gradually improved to the point that all military and government expenses could be paid on a monthly basis until June of this year. However, in July, Fan resigned due to illness and was succeeded by Xu Xiqing. The lower reaches of the counties suffered from drought and the early rice harvest was cut off, and famine victims filled the fields. Shanghai and other counties also experienced bandit police incidents, local chaos, and refugees along the way. Tax revenue was greatly affected, less than half of the original amount. On the expenditure side, military expenditure and relief funds suddenly increased significantly and were extremely urgent, awaiting allocation, causing the financial world to break the balance again and fall into a predicament. Now it is already October, and the upper half of the government expenses for various agencies in the provincial capital in September were only allocated yesterday because the Autumn Festival had arrived. It is said that this money was raised by the Finance Department from various sources. Therefore, when the lower half of the government expenses can be paid is still unknown. The military expenses, which are the most difficult to delay, are also short of more than 30,000 yuan in September, and there is no money to be issued. The expenses of provincial schools, which are 120,000 yuan per month, are allocated from the salt tax, and there has never been a delay in the past. Now, because the sales of edible salt in the upper reaches are stagnant and the tax revenue is insufficient, the Audit Office has no money to allocate and is also in arrears for two months without being issued. Teachers and staff have been urging the Education Department to pay for days, but they have only promised to issue 50% during the festival.</p>
<p>Since the social economy of Fuzhou was affected by the bandit disturbances in northern Fujian, it has also been extremely depressed. Many theaters and restaurants have closed down because of the lack of customers. Although Suzhou and Guangdong silk fabrics have big auction flags, there are very few buyers. Even pawnshops, which have the most stable business and have always made huge profits, are now unable to redeem their pawned items and cannot get rid of the overdue stolen goods, and are also in financial trouble. Earlier this month, the Du Guikou Xiehe store closed down, and yesterday the Qia Tai store on Ximen Street also closed down. It is said that the Jiuloumen Jusheng and Xiatucheng Fuyuan stores are also shaking. (October 2)</p>
<h3>Communist Forces Rampant in Eastern Henan, Yang Xiaohei's Band Sinks and Abandons Dengcheng, More Than 600 People Kidnapped by Bandits, The Garrison Troops Advance and Suppress Them, Retreating in Different Directions, Joining Forces with the Huo Xiao and Other Bandit Bands</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Xiao Liushao, Gu Dashen, and other bands were originally bandits in the Shaobai Temple area of Biyang, disrupting the areas of Biyang, Tanghe, Tongbai, Xinyang, Yexian, Xiangxian, Fangcheng, Nanyang in Henan, and Zaoyang and Sui County in northern Hubei for five or six years. Last year, they suddenly abandoned their old nest and fled to the east of the Pinghan Railway, joining forces with Cheng Daorong, Huo Guodong, and others. Their momentum was huge. In addition, Yang Xiaohei, Jiang Ma, and other bands kept pace with them. As a result, the counties belonging to the old Runan, Huaiyang, and Guide prefectures in Henan, as well as Fuyang and Taihe in northern Anhui, were filled with the flames of war, and alarming reports were frequent. In September, Liu Zhi believed that the bandit forces were rampant and personally went to the Shangcai area to urge the 13th Cavalry Brigade of Liu Fengqi, the Security Detachment of Cheng Zixuan, and other units to severely suppress them. However, the bandits were large bands of roaming bandits. They avoided when the troops were numerous, and fought when the troops were few, failing to annihilate them. The security teams in the counties, although large in number on the surface, were actually poorly equipped and lacked training. When they encountered bandit police incidents, they had no combat protection. As a result, various bandits roamed eastern Henan unhindered. On September 13, Cheng's band attacked and captured Lucheng County. The details of its passage and losses have been seen in the newspapers. On the 20th, the Xiaohei band attacked and captured Dengcheng Village in the northwest corner of Shangshui. The village is connected to Xihua, with the north gate close to the Shahe River, connecting the Luhe Station of the Pinghan Railway in the upper reaches and directly reaching Bengbu in the lower reaches. Commerce is prosperous and the situation is dangerous. It has not been harmed by bandits for several years. After being captured this time, more than 100 people were killed or injured, and more than 600 people were kidnapped. The garrison troops stationed in Zhoukou went to rescue them, and the bandits quickly retreated. One part returned to the Wuhanying Zhaoling Village area belonging to Yancheng, and the other part went to Xiangcheng, joining forces with Huo Xiao and others. Liu Zhi patrolled Fugou and other counties on the 27th of last month, ostensibly to inspect the official governance, but in reality to instruct the various units on the strategy of suppressing bandits. Liu returned to Bian on the morning of the 4th. It is said that the local bandits Huo Guodong, Cheng Daorong, Gu Tianshen, and Xiao Liushao in eastern Henan combined into one band, and Jiang Ma was one band. The Huo and Cheng bands were pursued by the 52nd Division of Xia Chuzhong and various security regiments, and Cheng Daorong and Ji Tianshen were indeed killed, losing most of their strength. On the 28th of last month, they fled from the northeast of Shenqiu, turned back to the southeast, and were chased by Cheng Ziyi's troops. About 100 people were intercepted near Yangjiaqiao. On the morning of the 2nd, they fled to a place about eight miles north of Shenqiu. The Xiangcheng Security Second Regiment was ordered to send a team to cooperate with the Shenqiu Security Team to attack. The bandits fled after hearing the news. Currently, Cheng Ziyi is leading the security teams and various regiments, as well as the cavalry and heavy artillery companies, to pursue them. As for Jiang Ma's band, they were previously near Tongchengzhen in Anhui, and when they heard the news that the Security Second Regiment had arrived in Xiangcheng, they fled in all directions.

<h3>Educational Progress in Zhejiang Province Over the Past Three Years</h3>
<p>Elementary Schools: 11,736 with 683,601 Students</p>
<p>Secondary Schools: 122 with 21,965 Students</p>
<p>People's Schools: 1,711 with 62,169 Students</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Zhejiang Province has always been known as a place of flourishing culture and education, and its education has always been considered developed. Although there have been financial difficulties in recent years, the authorities regard education as the foundation of the country and continue to actively promote it. According to the educational and cultural expenditures of Zhejiang Province, the total recurring expenses for the 19th year of the Republic amounted to 2,636,951 yuan; 2,839,238 yuan for the 20th year; and 2,241,934 yuan for the 21st year, when austerity measures were strictly implemented. Among them, school expenses accounted for 59% in the 19th year, 53.60% in the 20th year, and 59.810% in the 21st year; administrative expenses accounted for 7.30% in the 19th year, 7.8% in the 20th year, and still accounted for 7.30% in the 21st year; social education expenses accounted for 5.40% in the 19th year, 5.50% in the 20th year, and 7.06% in the 21st year; subsidies accounted for 7% in the 19th year, 13.40% in the 20th year, and 13.52% in the 21st year; overseas study expenses accounted for 9.40% in the 19th year, 9.50% in the 20th year, and 8.27% in the 21st year; and other expenses accounted for 4.20% in the 19th year, 3.50% in the 20th year, and 3.450% in the 21st year. From these figures, it can be seen that the authorities have made every effort to maintain the original percentage of funding for public schools and appropriately increase it amidst financial constraints. They have also spared no effort in developing social education and supporting private schools. However, in terms of overseas study expenses, they have adjusted the surplus and deficiency and tried their best to reduce administrative expenses to supplement them. This can be said to be painstaking. As for the educational expenditures of various counties and cities, except for Hangzhou City, which has unified revenue and expenditure, the total amount of the other 75 counties in the province has increased annually, totaling 2,106,995 yuan in the 19th year, 2,783,297 yuan in the 20th year, and 3,204,520 yuan in the 21st year. Regarding the educational expenditures of various counties, in addition to the original 40% of land tax, the Education Department repeatedly ordered consolidation of educational fees and also implemented methods to increase revenue, including: (1) allocating 20% from official land and sandy land (not yet implemented); (2) appropriately using inherent virtuous property to supplement private elementary school expenses; (3) land tax surcharges (43 counties); (4) slaughter and business tax (40 counties); (5) steamboat education levy (9 counties); (6) banquet education levy (10 counties); (7) school levy (6 counties); (8) local donations; (9) education grain levy (40 counties). This is sufficient to show the difficulty of educational expenditures in Zhejiang Province. The general situation of education in Zhejiang Province in the past three years amidst financial difficulties is described as follows:</p>
<h3>Higher Education</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province originally had four specialized schools: Industry, Agriculture, Law and Politics, and Medicine and Music. After the 16th year of the Republic, the Industry and Agriculture Specialized Schools were incorporated into the National Zhejiang University, while the Law and Politics and Medicine Specialized Schools were ordered to close in the 18th year. In March of the 20th year, the medical affairs were presented to request the resumption of enrollment and operation. After being forwarded to the Ministry of Education for approval, it was renamed Zhejiang Provincial Medical College, without building a hospital. Within the 21st year, a part has been completed, and the whole can be completed in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>For overseas study, Zhejiang Province had a general outline for dispatching students to study abroad when implementing the university district system. The number of students dispatched to Europe and America was limited to 20, and the number dispatched to Japan was limited to 60. In addition to needing to graduate from universities at home and abroad, public-funded students must also have served in the province for three years from the date of the National Revolutionary Army's pacification of Zhejiang. Therefore, it was not until the 19th year that it began to be implemented. A total of seven people were sent to the United States, and ten government-funded students were sent to the Sino-French University in Lyon, France, six of whom were dispatched from China and four of whom were supplemented from self-funded students in France. All were dispatched and supplemented according to the number within three years. As for studying in Japan, there were originally two types of students: government-funded students and subsidized students. The quota for government-funded students was 60, and the quota for subsidized students was 15. In the 19th year, the method was revised, reducing the number of government-funded students by 20 and increasing the number of subsidized students by 45.</p>
<h3>Secondary Education</h3>
<p>Establishing Normal Schools: At the beginning of the 19th year, the Department of Education had determined a plan to reorganize normal education, intending to start with the reorganization of teacher training institutions, and to fully develop rural normal education and add rural normal schools. In that year, the descendants of Wu Zuomo, a Chinese merchant residing in Japan, were willing to hand over the private Cixi Jintang School to the public for operation. Therefore, the school was changed to a provincial rural normal school. In the 20th year, Hangzhou Normal School was established, and in the 21st year, Wenzhou Normal School was planned and established, and students were enrolled this autumn. Many counties and cities have established model practice institutes, but the content facilities are mostly incomplete due to financial reasons. The Department of Education has carried out a thorough reorganization and has allocated a subsidy of 50,000 yuan since the 20th year. Therefore, the number of normal schools has increased in recent years, with 15 schools in the 19th year, 21 schools in the 20th year, and 28 schools in the 21st year. Establishing Girls' Middle Schools: The Provincial Girls' Middle School was originally merged into the First Middle School in the 16th year. In order to meet the special needs of girls' education, it was also separated and independent in the 21st year and a senior high school department was added.</p>
<p>Reorganizing Private Middle Schools: In recent years, private middle schools have been established one after another, especially in Hangzhou. Before the promulgation of the regulations on private schools by the Ministry of Education, their facilities were mostly without standards. Later, the Department of Education sent personnel to inspect and supervise them separately to file for registration, or to conduct trial operations, close down, or suspend operations. Currently, 45 schools have been approved for registration, 2 schools have been temporarily approved for registration, and 12 schools have not yet been registered. Combining all the middle schools in the province, there were 79 schools in the 19th year, 85 schools in the 20th year, and 85 schools in the 21st year.</p>
<p>Paying Attention to Vocational Education: The senior agricultural science middle school attached to the Agricultural and Industrial Colleges of the National Zhejiang University was originally attached to the Agricultural and Industrial Colleges of the Provincial Zhejiang University. After the Agricultural and Industrial Colleges were reorganized into the two colleges of Zhejiang University, the two schools were also changed to affiliated high schools. In June of the 19th year, Zhejiang University decided to stop enrolling students and close the affiliated high schools in the 19th year due to financial difficulties. The Department of Education believed that it was necessary to maintain the high schools and formulated a method for subsidizing the expenses, renaming them Zhejiang University Agency-Run Senior Agricultural Science and Industrial Science Middle Schools. The Department of Education also believed that the old metal was the main agricultural area and the people engaged in both farming and reading. In the 21st year, it was appropriate to establish agricultural education at the foot of Jishan Mountain in Tangya, Jinhua County. It has already enrolled students this autumn. Other junior high schools have been ordered to add vocational subjects in the 20th year, and 20,000 yuan has been allocated for adding vocational subjects. Currently, some junior high schools have established mechanical, commercial, and home economics subjects. Vocational schools in the past three years: 13 schools in the 19th year, 15 schools in the 20th year, and 16 schools in the 21st year.</p>
<h3>Elementary Education</h3>
<p>Improving Attached Elementary Schools of Middle Schools: Improve the treatment of teachers and staff in attached elementary schools of middle schools and stipulate the term of office. The current monthly salary of the principal has been increased to 80 yuan, and the teachers and staff are divided into two levels with an average of 40 yuan and 45 yuan. The initial term of office is one semester, the continuation of the term is one academic year, and the second continuation of the term is two academic years. Before the 19th year, the trial research matters they were engaged in were inevitably independent. In the 20th and 21st years, the Department of Education provided necessary problems to be solved and assigned them to research, and intensified the guidance work, tried the promulgated curriculum, and drafted local teaching materials. In terms of school buildings, in addition to allocating 45,066 yuan for the reconstruction of the attached elementary school of the Second Middle School, the attached elementary schools of the High School, Second Middle School, Seventh Middle School, and Eleventh Middle School have all been built. The original allocation of 36,734 yuan to the Sixth Middle School was stopped in March due to national disaster.</p>
<p>Promoting the Establishment of Township Elementary Schools: Establishing at least one primary school in each township according to the autonomous region is a major policy that the Department of Education strives to achieve. However, the decline of the countryside and economic difficulties have an impact on the progress. According to the current survey, there are a total of 12,692 townships in 75 counties in the province. In the 20th year, 8,036 townships had established primary schools, and 4,656 townships had not established primary schools. In the 21st year, 172 townships had established primary schools, and 237 townships had established primary schools.</p>
<p>Establishing Central Elementary Schools: Zhejiang Province set up central elementary schools at the time of the trial implementation of the university district system. Its task was to be the general institution of the elementary education research association in the sub-district. After the first provincial guidance meeting in July of the 19th year, the central elementary school was also the host institution of the county and city school district auxiliary meeting. There were 169 central elementary schools in the whole province in the 20th year, with an expenditure of 118,598 yuan, and the number increased to 186 in the 21st year, with an expenditure of 265,083 yuan.</p>
<p>Screening and Guiding Private Schools: There are many private schools in various counties. The Department of Education believed that it was not appropriate to strictly ban them at this time when primary schools were not yet developed, so it tried to improve their teaching efficiency. In the 19th year, it ordered the issuance of measures for the management of private schools and ordered the counties and cities to guide and assess them. Those with excellent results could be changed to substitute primary schools and given subsidies. In the 20th year, registration was held, and only those who were qualified were temporarily allowed to be established. In the first year, the outline of the private school teachers' seminar was re-ordered, and those who passed the examination were given certificates and ordered to improve the outline of the private school, hoping that it would form a rural primary school in the future.</p>
<h3>Social Education</h3>
<p>Mass Education Teacher Training Institutions:</p>
<p>For the sake of cultivating mass education talents and trial research, the Department of Education began to establish the Provincial Mass Education Experimental School in the 19th year, and attached the Experimental Mass School, the Experimental Mass Education Center, and the Experimental Mass Sports Ground. Graduates in the 20th year included 53 graduates from the social education administration specialization department, and in the 21st year, there were 43 graduates from the normal class.</p>
<p>Establishing Provincial Stadiums: In the 20th year, the venue of the National Games was allocated to the province. Therefore, houses were rebuilt, equipment was added, and a provincial stadium was established.</p>
<p>Concurrent Mass Education: After the 18th year, although mass education institutions have shown a positive trend of promotion, they both felt economic and talent difficulties, so they had to temporarily operate concurrently by using the inherent teacher equipment of schools at all levels. According to statistics, the number of mass schools concurrently operated by middle and primary schools in the past three years was 1,590 classes in the 19th year, 2,069 classes in the 20th year, and 2,089 classes in the 21st year.</p>
<p>Promotion of Mass Education: After the Department of Education founded the Mass Education Experimental School in the 19th year and set up social education administration specialization and normal department, in addition to enrolling the normal department every year, the affiliated mass school also had a teacher training class. In the 19th year, it jointly held a short-term advanced study conference with Zhejiang University, teaching adult learning psychology and the implementation method of mass schools, etc. The number of civil schools and students increased year by year. There were 1,853 classes in the 19th year with 17,587 graduates, 2,237 classes in the 20th year with 21,070 graduates, and 2,270 classes in the 21st year, and the total number of graduates has not yet been fully reported and the total number is unknown. As for the mass education centers in various counties and cities, in addition to the provincial mass education centers in the province as models, various counties have also expanded them. There were 82 in the 19th year, 95 in the 20th year, and 103 in the 21st year.</p>
<p>In total, in the past three years (from the 19th year to the 21st year, not referring to the year), the number of primary schools has increased from 10,846 to 11,736, the number of students has increased from 605,748 to 683,601, and the expenditure has increased from 4,262,430 yuan to 5,033,545 yuan. The number of secondary schools has increased from 92 to 122, the number of students has increased from 16,735 to 21,965, and the expenditure has increased from 1,889,373 yuan to 2,226,566 yuan. The number of mass schools has increased from 1,059 to 1,712, the number of students has increased from 38,554 to 62,169, and the expenditure has increased from 40,268 yuan to 82,313 yuan. Considering the actual situation of Zhejiang Province's finances and economy, the progress cannot but be said to be rapid.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of the Hwa Yang Bridge Murder Case in Songjiang</h3>
<p>The murder of Tu, the wife of Qian Quan, chairman of the Zhengda Rice Shop in Hwa Yang Bridge, on the evening of June 19th at around 8 p.m., shocked the whole city. At the time, there was much discussion, mainly due to the disagreement between her younger brother Wei Sheng and Wei Quan over property, which led to a tragic family change. Subsequently, on the day after the incident, the Hwa Yang Bridge police station received a long-distance call from Jiang Ahe from the Datong Hotel in Shanghai, inquiring about the Xi murder case. Soon, it was rumored that Zhuang had an affair with Song Xiaomei, the concubine of Wei Sheng, and Jiang's usual behavior was improper. Based on this clue, Detective Yang Shijie of the Public Security Bureau arrested the suspect Xu Guanxiang. According to the confession, the perpetrator Sun Ahe was arrested. In addition, Fei Gongxia, a patrol officer of the county water patrol team, also arrested the suspects Wu Zixiang and the kidnapper Shen Bingsheng, etc., and conducted preliminary trials separately. Xi Wei Sheng and Song Xiaomei were suspected of instigating the crime and were also arrested. When Sun Ahe was arrested at Qi Yu Bridge, he tried to escape and suffered a gunshot wound to his left ankle. In his confession during the preliminary trial at the Public Security Bureau, he admitted without reservation, roughly saying that Xi Wei Sheng had a disagreement with his brother over property, and conspired with Jiang Ahe in Shanghai to murder Wei Quan to vent his hatred. There was a written agreement stating that he would be rewarded with 3,000 yuan if the matter was successful. Jiang had an affair with Song Xiaomei and repeatedly opened rooms in the Jiuhua and Zhongnan hotels. He only met Wei Sheng and made an agreement. Jiang then found me, Zhu Chunlou, and a burly man with an unknown surname, and used a boat to carry pine to Songjiang, where we carried out the shooting in the evening. Xu Guanxiang confessed that he had heard about each matter beforehand, but did not go to the scene until the day he was transferred to the prosecutor's office. Prosecutor Zhu personally went to the Public Security Bureau to interrogate each suspect, and their confessions remained unchanged. Although each suspect retracted their confessions during the prosecutor's subsequent interrogations, it was clear that Sun Ahe was the perpetrator. Tu Caiming (Wei Quan's niece) clearly identified him, and Sun Ahe also stated at the Public Security Bureau that on the night of the crime, he had ambushed behind the earthen mound opposite the Xi family, waiting for the time to launch the attack. Prosecutor Zhu went to the site for investigation based on the confession, and it was indeed the same as the confession. He also summoned Song Wenjie and Zhang Youkuan, the receptionists of the Jiuhua and Datong hotels in Shanghai, to testify in court, stating that Xi Wei Sheng and Song Xiaomei had repeatedly stayed at the hotel. The prosecutor believed that the investigation was over and filed a public prosecution. Today (the 7th), at 9 a.m., Judge Zhang Yihuang of the Criminal Court, accompanied by Clerk Guo Yuying, opened the court to try the victim's family members, lawyers Gu Shouyi and Tu Heyun, the defendant Xi Wei Sheng, lawyer Yan Luxiang, and Song Xiaomei and Xu Guanxiang, lawyers Wu Chengbi and Lu Liang were appointed by the court to defend them. First, the witness Tu Caiming was summoned to describe the situation of the bandits coming to the house, saying that two bandits came to buy soap, one wearing a blue cloth shirt and black pants, wearing a straw hat, and the bandit who pointed the gun and forced Tu was Sun Ahe, who was wearing a black short shirt and pants. I avoided entering the room and then heard three or four consecutive gunshots and the bandits escaped. Wei Sheng and his wife came after my uncle (referring to Wei Quan) and aunt (Tu) died. The deceased's sons, Shi Ying and Shi Chang, were able to avoid disaster at their aunt's house across the street. I was questioned about any previous discord between Wei Sheng and his brother, and I said that I did not understand. Then, Shi Rong and Shi Chang were summoned, and their confessions were roughly the same as Tu Caiming's. Xie Zhicheng testified that on the day after the incident, he happened to receive a call from Jiang Ahe from the Datong Hotel in Shanghai, inquiring about the Xi murder case. Later, he met Detective Yang Shijie at the Xu town mayor's office and talked about the situation of the long-distance call. Detective Yang Shijie testified about the process of obtaining clues and arresting Xu Guanxiang and Sun Ahe. Then, Pan Changhe, Xi Wei Sheng's accountant, and Zhu San, Xi Wei Quan's servant, were summoned and questioned about any previous opinions between the Xi Wei Sheng brothers. Their confessions were the same. Tang Xianghe and Ling He, who Xi Wei Sheng and his wife testified to going to Shanghai with, both testified that they did not go to Shanghai together. After the above witnesses finished testifying, Xu Guanxiang was summoned and testified that he was 31 years old, from Xiaotang, and had been a detective in the water police. He met Jiang Ahe once while playing cards. Detective Yang invited me to help solve the case and went to Hangtou to arrest Zhu Chunlou without success. When he returned to the Public Security Bureau, he was immediately arrested, which was a false accusation. He concluded that he did not know Xi Wei Sheng, Song Xiaomei, or Sun Ahe. Xi Wei Sheng also testified that he went to Shanghai in January to seek medical treatment and went to Shanghai twice in April and May to purchase electrical materials and had no organization with Jiang Ahe. He said that it was a false accusation. It was already noon, and the official ordered that the interrogation continue in the afternoon. At around 2 p.m., Song Xiaomei was summoned and her confession was full of denial. She even claimed that she did not know Jiang Ahe, Xu Guanxiang, etc. Sun Ahe was also summoned and completely retracted his confession. He also denied the confession that the prosecutor had interrogated at the Public Security Bureau. Wu Zixiang and Shen Bingsheng both said that the confessions at the Water Patrol Team were forced by torture. They insisted that they did not know the Wei Sheng couple. Then, the witness Song Wenjie Zhang Wenkuan testified that Xi Wei Sheng's arrival date in Shanghai was submitted to the circulation book as evidence. Subsequently, Tu Caiming pointed out Sun Ahe in court as the perpetrator wearing black short shirts and pants on June 19. After the interrogation, Judge Zhang ordered Jin A Yue to be summoned and scheduled a continuation of the interrogation, and each defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Wuxi County Chief Accused of Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Zhang Guangdi, the head of the second district under the county, has been too hasty in handling affairs and has not known how to deal with them, resulting in disharmony with the local situation. Recently, citizens of the district such as Yuan Xitong have repeatedly filed complaints with the county government against Zhang Guangdi for illegal dereliction of duty. After receiving the complaints, County Chief Yan believed that both the truth and falsehood should be investigated and dispatched the police to summon the plaintiffs Yuan Xitong, Ren Yaodou, Zhu Shimao, Tang Renqiangen, and Shao Leji to the county for interrogation by County Chief Yan himself. He ordered them to be sent back and waited for verification. In addition, citizens of the district such as Chen Yuanji also filed a complaint with the county court against Zhang Guangdi for corruption, perverting the law, and doing everything possible, accusing him of dereliction of duty.

<h3>Female Witch's Treatment Leads to Death</h3>
<p>A Gen, the youngest son of Xu Genfu of Tang Xu Lane, Sitou Town, 35th District (Tianshang City), was 26 years old. He was previously a tea servant in a Shanghai hotel and has now resigned. Three years ago, he married Quan, the daughter of Gao of Xizhang. Six or seven days ago, Ms. Gao suddenly suffered from typhoid fever. Her husband, A Gen, was confused by superstition and immediately extended a female witch from Wuxiang, Changzhou, to his home for treatment. At that time, he paid 19 yuan, stating that he would guarantee a cure. The female witch spoke wildly and said that the patient was irritable, so she used ropes to tie up her feet. When the disease became critical, she extended a doctor for diagnosis and treatment, and prescribed strict medicine. The female witch learned about the matter and said, "The patient is protected by gods and does not need to take medicine. If you have to take medicine, you will offend the gods, and I will not be responsible." The Gao family heard this and believed that she was a fairy, so they had no choice but to resolutely abandon the prepared medicine. At this time, Ms. Gao's illness had entered the bone marrow and could not be saved. Yesterday, she finally faded away. Xu A Gen, the husband of the deceased, knew that he had been deceived, so he launched a major crusade. The female witch knew that things were not good and immediately escaped. Pan A Yun, the head of the Tu, believed that the matter was a homicide and reported it to the county court, requesting to send someone to investigate.</p>

In order to be cautious, the association immediately sent Inspector Jin Jiwen to carry the raincoats and send a letter to the Shanghai Machinery Association. The association hired experts to identify the goods, and confirmed that they were enemy goods. After Jin Jiwen returned to Changzhou, he reported to the association and summoned Yan Zhonglin and others to the association. Because they had no power to punish them, they asked them to write a letter of regret and confiscated 17 raincoats and 14 rain hats, and paraded them in the streets to shame them.</p>

Each person held a silk flag and wore a silk badge. At around 11 a.m., they marched in formation to the county government to petition. Eight representatives were selected to meet with the county magistrate to state the reasons for opposing Dasheng and requesting relief. County Magistrate Ma replied with three points: First, he called the Public Security Bureau inspector general to discuss the matter with the Chamber of Commerce and the County Party Department and summoned the person in charge of Dasheng to talk, restricting his business. He can only sell the entire bolt and cannot sell retail. He should join the Silk Industry Association and abide by the association's charter. Second, he instructed the representatives to inform the clerks of each industry that there must be no extracurricular actions. Third, if Dasheng does not accept the regulations, then he will give a final warning. If an incident is caused by this, Dasheng should be held responsible. The representatives were satisfied. When they arrived at the County Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Wang met with them and also replied with three points: First, he advised the bureau to stop the proceedings if possible. Second, he limited the period to whole sales and not retail sales. Third, he hoped that all industries would unite and that there would be no internal disputes. Later, each representative went to the County Party Department, where Standing Committee Member Yu Peiren met with them, gave them advice, and promised to be consistent with the county government. The clerks of the six industries dispersed, and the silk industry opened as usual in the afternoon, waiting for the Party, government, and Chamber of Commerce to resolve the matter.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Yongjia Bandit Leader Executed by Shooting</h3>
<p>Hu Gongmian, commander of the 13th Army of the Bandit Army in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, has been captured and executed in Shanghai last year. His remaining bandits are still lurking in the Fenlinxi area of Yongjia County, attempting to revive. In order to eliminate the bandits completely, the Security Department has specially approved the establishment of a Bandit Suppression Command Headquarters in six counties in the province to closely monitor the activities of the communists. On the 20th of last month, the Bandit Suppression Department learned that the bandit leader Xu Wenlong had sneaked into Yongjia to carry out activities, and immediately dispatched personnel to capture him that night, and telegraphed the Security Department for instructions. The Security Department approved the provincial government to send a telegram to the bandit suppression commander Yang Zhiqu on the 4th to execute the bandit Xu on the spot by shooting. It is heard that Xu is a native of Fenglin, Yongjia. He once served as the leader of the first team of the first phase of the Whampoa Military Academy and served as the commander of the National Army regiment.

<h3>Pinghu Social Daily Declares Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>Since its publication, the Social Daily of this county has been repeatedly interfered with by the Security Corps and other organizations, and has been repeatedly accused by the Qianzhuang School Party Newspaper.

A few days ago, an editor Wu and others were arrested and prosecuted by the county government for refusing to buy tickets and disturbing the theater, and the manager Xu Shijun was approved to arrest them. It became more difficult for the newspaper to maintain itself, so it closed down today. It is heard that the loss is very large.</p>

After more than half a year, as the central government repeatedly urged him to return to his post, he came to Shanghai from Beijing in the late last month to settle personal matters. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, he took the Japanese ship "Chichibu Maru" to the east to return to his post, accompanied by his secretary Ding Shaoji and two attendants.

<h3>Military Police Participate in the Grand Ceremony</h3>
<p>For this grand completion ceremony of the new Municipal Government Building, the Security Team originally planned a large-scale joint military and police inspection at the Longhua Airport. However, due to the continuous heavy rain and the distance between the new Municipal Government Building and Longhua, traffic was quite difficult. The Municipal Government changed the location to the square in front of the new building. However, the square was narrow and very muddy, which was not suitable for inspection. Therefore, the inspection was not officially held, and the troops were only lined up on the rectangular road surrounding the square to show their participation in the grand ceremony and held a passing-in-review parade to express their respect to the Mayor. The troops present included two companies of trainees from the Training Team of the Security Department, the First Infantry Regiment, one company of Browning gun soldiers, one company of mortar soldiers, and one company of armored bicycles (equipped with light machine guns), the Police Brigade of the Public Security Bureau, and two battalions of the Defense Corps, all under the command of Qi Xueqi, commander of the Security Department. The military appearance was very grand, but since the venue was narrow, each unit was reduced in size and staffing for the parade.</p>
<h3>Hospitality for Chinese and Foreign Journalists</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government will issue special admission passes for journalists to all newspapers, news agencies, and foreign journalists in this city, two for each organization. If photography is required, each organization will be issued one admission pass for the photographer. (To obtain this admission pass, a letter must be sent to the Propaganda Section of the Second Division of the Municipal Government.) The Municipal Government has specially set up a press reception office in the rear of the new building. Journalists and photographers from various newspapers can go to the reception hall to contact the staff upon arrival. Press seats will be set up in the auditorium and parade ground to facilitate journalists from various newspapers to write news reports. Regarding those who are shooting newsreels, whether sound or silent, the number of assistants must be determined in advance and notified so that admission passes can be issued. Photographers will be guided by photography reception staff to the location for filming. Each newsreel company will be assigned one reception staff member to be responsible for guidance. Anyone who has an admission pass must wear it on their chest for identification and convenient reception.</p>

According to the products produced by Europe and the United States in the past, there is no such product, and the price is not so low. The quality is inferior, the workmanship is rough, the order is not in this road name, and it uses the name of our company to mix and sell in the market, revealing the shape of inferior goods. Since its establishment more than 20 years ago, our company has specialized in European and American woolens and finely made high-end Western clothing. It has an outstanding reputation and has been praised by all walks of life.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants in Vietnam Hope to Sign a Trade Agreement with Vietnam Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the Sino-French Trade Agreement with Vietnam, according to diplomatic sources, it will be signed in a day or two. Chen Fusheng, an overseas Chinese merchant in Vietnam, has returned to Shanghai from Vietnam. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him at his residence yesterday and talked about the plight of the overseas Chinese in that area in great detail. The record of his talk is as follows: Overseas Chinese in Vietnam have always had trade agreements to protect their business. Since the government announced the implementation of the new customs tariff in 1929, all Sino-French trade agreements with Vietnam have not been implemented. In the process of abolishing the old agreement and not establishing a new one, overseas Chinese in Vietnam have been in a position of no treaty country. Goods are imported and taxed according to ordinary tariffs, and the tax rate has increased by 10% to several tens of percent compared with the effective old agreement, resulting in increasingly difficult business operations. At the same time, the Japan-Vietnam Trade Agreement has been implemented, and Japanese goods exported to Vietnam, such as tea and silk, are subject to the most-favored-nation tariff treatment. Even ordinary goods are reduced by about 10%. By comparison, overseas Chinese merchants are even more trapped in a desperate situation. If this is not saved, there will be no place for overseas Chinese to stand in Vietnam. Therefore, they urgently hope that the central government will sign a trade agreement with Vietnam with the French side as soon as possible in order to alleviate the suffering of the overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Temporary Exemption from Measurement and Weight Verification Fee for Public Use; Verification Must Be Added When Used Frequently</h3>

The public weights and measures of the various ministries' meetings, the various provincial and municipal governments, and their affiliated agencies must be verified and inspected by the local verification agencies, and no excuses shall be made. Regarding the verification fee, those who belong to the use of weights and measures for official purposes by various agencies can be temporarily exempted in order to exemplify official affairs and facilitate promotion. Yesterday, the Municipal Government also ordered its subordinates to comply with it.</p>

<h3>Fulun Silk Factory Went on Strike the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: The Fulun Hengji Shuang Gong Silk Factory at the bottom of Tianbao Road, Hongkou, employs a total of 400 male and female workers. In July of this year, it once went on strike due to wage issues. It was then resolved through mediation by the Social Bureau, and three measures were set. The labor and management sides all worked in accordance with the regulations and were in peace. Unexpectedly, the afternoon before yesterday (after the rice work), half of the female workers in the factory stopped entering the factory to work. Those who had already gone to work also left the factory and went on strike because the work was not uniform. Shen Zupei, the manager of the factory, believed that the workers went on strike suddenly for no reason and immediately notified the Fourth District Silk Spinning Industry Association of the situation for inquiry. The union had not heard of it beforehand. Yesterday morning, although half of the workers in the factory went to work, the capital side did not sound the whistle to start the car because they were afraid that the number of people was uneven. It is planned to sound the whistle to start work from today.</p>

<h3>The Qian Yuan Zhuang Liquidation: A City Merchants' Meeting to Remedy the Zhuang Piao Situation</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng She, after the Qian Yuan Fu Ji Qian Zhuang in Shijialong, Huayi Street, Nanshi, suddenly closed down for liquidation on September 30th, a major dispute arose. In addition to handling the rejection of payment certification, the City Merchants' Association yesterday convened a meeting of the silver and money industry to discuss remedial measures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Liquidation Process: The Qian Yuan Fu Ji Zhuang had a capital of 224,000 yuan. The shareholders were Zheng Jianzhi with two and a half shares, Guo Guangyu Tang with two shares, Chen Zifang with one and a half shares, Yao Ziruo with one and a half shares, Wang Jimou with one and a half shares, and Zheng Hongting with one share. The manager was Shen Likang, and the assistant manager was Zhu Esheng. They were members of the Qianye Tongye Gonghui (Money Industry Guild). The Zhuang had been operating for 50 years. On September 30th, due to business reasons, it suddenly announced its closure. Manager Shen Likang entrusted lawyer Xi Yuchang to handle the liquidation and reported it to the Qianye Tongye Gonghui. The lawyer published a notice in the newspaper on October 2nd, informing creditors to bring their documents for registration within one week.</p>
<p>Refusal to Pay: On September 30th, various Piao (Zhuang Piao) holders took their Piao to Qian Yuan Fu Ji Zhuang to request payment. The Zhuang accepted the Piao and agreed to pay, and immediately cancelled the Piao with a circular stamp. But it suddenly stopped business and returned the cancelled Piao to the Piao holders. As a result, the Piao holders believed that since the Piao had already been accepted, the Zhuang should not have refused to pay and returned the Piao. Especially, the Piao should not have been cancelled since the cancellation of the Piao meant that it was voided. They asked the City Merchants' Association for assistance. After receiving the request from the Piao holders, the City Merchants' Association, in accordance with Article 103 of the Law of Negotiable Instruments regarding the certificate of refusal, requested the notary public at the place of refusal of acceptance or refusal of payment, or a representative from the merchants' association, bank association, to create and issue a certificate of refusal of payment. After the Piao holders filled it out, they sent it to the Merchants' Association to affix the original Piao, add the seal of Zheng, for verification.</p>
<p>Meeting to Discuss Remedies: The City Merchants' Association convened a meeting of the silver and money industry and silk industry yesterday at 3 p.m. to discuss remedies. Tai Wuqing from the Qianye Gonghui, Xu Baoqi from the Bank Association, and Sun Haishan and Feng Shao from the silk industry attended. Luo Qinghua, director of the business department of the Merchants' Association, presided over the meeting. First, the silk industry representatives described the situation of the Qian Yuan Zhuang returning the Piao and refusing to accept it. Then, the Qianye representatives reported on the historical practices and the provisions of the Law of Negotiable Instruments, stating that the original Piao should be returned. It was decided that the principle of returning the original Piao should be followed, according to the provisions of Article 93 of the Law of Negotiable Instruments: (The drawer, acceptor, endorser, and other debt obligors are jointly and severally liable to the holder. The holder may exercise the right of recourse against one or several or all of the aforementioned debt obligors without regard to the order in which they are liable. If the holder has already exercised the right of recourse against one or several of the debt obligors, he may still exercise the right of recourse against other negotiable instrument debt obligors.)</p>
<p>Zhuang Piao Credit: According to a Xin Sheng She investigation, the Qian Yuan Zhuang's announcement of liquidation and the cancellation of unpaid Zhuang Piao was an extremely erroneous measure and would affect the credit of Zhuang Piao. Zhuang Piao, commonly known as bank notes, are absolutely the responsibility of the Qian Zhuang after they are issued. They circulate in the market like cash, and their credit has always been very solid. Even if the Qian Zhuang has problems, the Qian Zhuang shareholders should bear unlimited liability. According to current laws, they should be jointly and severally liable. Therefore, the Qian Zhuang is responsible, not the issuer of the Piao. When the issuer issues the Piao, they have already paid the cash into the Qian Zhuang, so the Qian Zhuang can issue the Piao. After this Qian Yuan liquidation, in the silk industry, those who hold the Zhuang Piao are returning them to the original holders because they cannot be cashed. The original holders are also refusing to accept them based on contract law, which has caused disputes. However, regardless of the outcome of this case, the Piao holders will not suffer losses. If the Qian Yuan Zhuang Piao cannot be cashed in full, it will inevitably affect the credit of all Zhuang Piao in the city.</p>
<h3>City Merchants' Association Petitions for Changes in Import and Export Taxes on Cottonseed Cake: Preserve Raw Materials to Achieve Regulation and Protection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Merchants' Association yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance requesting changes in the import and export taxes on cottonseed and cottonseed cake. The original text is recorded as follows: The petition is for the matter of petitioning. On the 4th of this month, a letter was received from the Association of Oil Pressing Factories, stating, "It has come to our members' attention that cottonseed cake (referred to as 'cotton cake,' or 'cotton cake powder' when ground) produced by various cottonseed oil pressing factories has historically been a major export item, with the majority exported to Japan over the years. Cotton cake is actually a natural fertilizer, with properties and functions similar to our soybean cake. Previously, because the export tax on cotton cake was higher than that on soybean cake, Japanese merchants who purchased our cotton cake switched to buying our raw material (cottonseed) for their own production. However, our cottonseed is originally an item insufficient for domestic use. Since Japanese merchants came to China to buy it, our oil factories have commonly felt a shortage of raw materials, and work has become impossible. Some have even closed down as a result. Therefore, in the winter of the 14th year of the Republic of China, our association sent a letter to the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, which was submitted to the former Beijing Tax Office, and it was approved to instruct all customs offices to collect the export tax on cotton cake at the same rate as the tax rate on cake, in order to maintain this business. However, in the revised export tariff promulgated by the National Government on May 7, 1931, the tax rate on cotton cake was again increased to 5.3 fen per dan, while the rate on soybean cake remained the same as before, at 3.5 fen per dan, a difference of nearly one-third. As a result, the sales of our cotton cake suddenly decreased sharply. After the promulgation of the revised tariff, it coincided with the Japanese invasion of our country, and the northeastern provinces were the main production area of soybean cake. The Japanese were very happy to have the power in their hands, and they widely purchased soybean cake from that area, transported it to Japan duty-free, and substituted it for their cotton cake needs, hoping to cut off our inherent sales channels. On the other hand, they bought cottonseed in our southeastern provinces, resulting in the lack of cotton cake sales this year and a shortage of cottonseed raw materials. The industry association has repeatedly consulted and unanimously agreed that the only way to save the dying industry is to request the government to approve the duty-free export of cotton cake and increase the export tax on cottonseed. Making cotton cake duty-free would reduce the export cost, so that even if Japan did not buy it, it could still be exported to other countries. If the export tax on cottonseed is not increased, our cottonseed will likely be completely utilized by the Japanese. Regardless of the future sales of our cotton cake, the factories in the country have already felt the pain of having no rice to cook. Although oil factory bankruptcies are not surprising, the workers and staff who rely on oil factories for their livelihoods number in the hundreds of thousands nationwide. At a time when all industries are declining and rural areas are collapsing, if they suddenly lose their livelihoods, it is feared that some will take desperate risks. Who wouldn't be chilled by the prospect? Therefore, we dare to rely on your esteemed organization to present the facts to the government, to take into consideration the difficulties of the merchants, and to approve the duty-free export of cotton cake and increase the export tax on cottonseed, and to instruct all customs offices to comply, so that our country's oil factories will not be prematurely destroyed."</p>
<p>The association has received the letter and checked it out. The increase in export tariffs originally had the effect of protecting industrial raw materials. In the past, because cotton cake was a natural fertilizer for farmland, exports should have been prevented, so it was presented and approved to gradually increase the export tax rate. Later, Japanese merchants widely collected cottonseed to make their own cotton cake, and cottonseed was also an item insufficient for domestic use. Once exported, the raw materials for factories to manufacture cotton cake would also be cut off from then on. At this time, the trend has shifted to cottonseed rather than cotton cake, based on the raw materials that should be preserved. The way of government is to relax and contract according to the times, and it cannot be adhered to one thing. Moreover, the Japanese occupy the Northeast, and the production of soybean cake is entirely under their control. In reality, there is no need for cotton cake. Heavy export taxes do not help the policy towards Japan, but only cut off sales to other countries. Therefore, we dare to present the advantages and disadvantages in detail, and we ask that your ministry examine and approve the increase in the export tax on cottonseed and the elimination of the export tax on cotton cake, in order to achieve the effect of regulation and protection. We are most eager.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Limits the Establishment of the New Exchange Within a Month</h3>
<p>The merger of the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange and the Gold Industry Exchange has been in dispute for several years. It was not until Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Zhang Xiaolin mediated that a satisfactory solution was reached. At that time, the chairmen of the two exchanges immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to report on the mediation process and to establish a preparatory office to actively prepare for the establishment of the new exchange. The Ministry of Industry has also approved the reports of the two exchanges. The reports and the Ministry's approval are recorded below:</p>
<p>Report: The Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange and the Shanghai Gold Industry Exchange telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, saying (omitted titles), "The two exchanges have been given much consideration, and deeply understand the difficulties of the merchants. We have requested Mr. Du Yuesheng to mediate and resolve the disputes, and to persuade both parties to each invest one million yuan, divided into 200,000 shares, each share worth ten yuan, to jointly form a new exchange. A preparatory office will be established immediately to discuss the details and establish the exchange within a specified period. At this time, the status quo will be temporarily maintained. Once formally established, the exchanges will be closed. The two exchanges unanimously agree and report this first. We implore your approval." Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange, and Xu Fenghui, Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Industry Exchange, respectfully.</p>
<p>Instruction: The Ministry of Industry approved on October 4th, saying, "We have received the report. Since the two exchanges have agreed to jointly invest in establishing another new exchange, and the two original exchanges will each be closed, the verification is feasible and should be approved. However, the new exchange should actively prepare immediately and report its establishment within this month, without further delay."</p>
<p>Zhejiang High Court Replies to Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association Letter</p>
<p>Regarding the Establishment of a High Court Branch within the Yinxian Court</p>
<p>The Zhejiang High Court replied to the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association, saying, "In direct reply: Your association's letter regarding the establishment of a High Court branch in Ningbo and the establishment of the High Court branch within the Yinxian District Court, believing that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, inquiring about the details, and hoping for a response, etc., has been received. It has been investigated that our court previously received an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, that since the Court Organization Law has been promulgated, the level of trial changes after future implementation. The first and second instance cases originally handled by the local court will be handled by the High Court. Appellants will be far from home and wait for information, which is uneconomical in terms of expenses and labor. A High Court branch should be added to facilitate litigation, etc. After careful planning, it was presented and approved. Except for the first and second instance cases originally handled by the Hangzhou, Yongjia, and Jinhua District Courts, which were assigned to the High Court and the first and second High Court branches for handling nearby, a third High Court branch was established in Yinxian County to handle the first and second instance cases originally handled by the Yinxian District Court. In addition, part of the second instance cases under the old Kuaiji Dao jurisdiction handled by the High Court will be assigned to the third branch court for convenience to the people. The site required for the third High Court branch will be carved out from the Yinxian Court, and courtrooms and offices will be added to the vacant land in the court for application. This is the detailed situation of this case. Yinxian County is the location of the old Kuaiji Dao government, with convenient transportation and a suitable area. Establishing a third High Court branch there will not only benefit the litigants in the jurisdiction, but will also promote the prosperity of Yinxian County in terms of commerce. As for the High Court or branch court and the District Court being located in the same place, there have been precedents in Hangzhou, Yongjia, and Jinhua. The nature is independent and not affiliated. Judging from the past situation, no problems have arisen due to being located in the same place. Furthermore, finding another court site is indeed very difficult. However, the above plan can only be realized after the Court Organization Law is implemented. Before the Court Organization Law is implemented, the status quo will be temporarily maintained. We are responding to your inquiry and hope that you will investigate and take note. Respectfully addressed to the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association."</p>
<h3>A Security Guard Impersonates an Officer, Carries a Weapon, and Arrests Flower Fair Attendees Without Authorization</h3>
<p>Zhang Tingju, a police officer on duty at the First District General Office of the City Public Security Bureau, heard on the evening before last, at about 8 p.m., that an agency was arresting Flower Fair attendees in Doushi Street in his jurisdiction. He immediately went to investigate and found that a man named Zhou Shunfang had been arrested at No. 108 Doushi Street. Officer Zhang chased him to the entrance of the Wanjiju Soy Sauce Garden before catching up. One of the men in uniform claimed to be Zhang Rui, a member of the Second Garden Team of the Security Office, and was ordered to arrest Flower Fair attendees. Officer Zhang believed that he had no formal order and had not coordinated with the local auxiliary police, so he ordered him to report to the district. Zhang Rui, who claimed to be a member of the Security Office, initially refused, and then gave two yuan to Officer Zhang, asking him not to take him to the district. Officer Zhang, believing that his actions were improper, firmly refused and brought Zhang Rui, the arrested Zhou Yuancai, and an unloaded pistol and three bundles of blank Flower Fair paper strips found on Zhang Rui to the district for investigation. According to Zhou Shuncai's confession, he lived at No. 108 Doushi Street and worked as a laundryman. Suddenly, three people came to his house, one in uniform, and arrested him. They walked to Wanjiju Soy Sauce Garden and met the police who took them to the district. He didn't know why. According to Zhang Rui's confession, his real name was Wu Jinbiao, and he worked as a security guard at the Security Office. Today, he was drinking at the home of Chief Hu of the Fifth Team and heard someone say that there was a Flower Fair agency. So, two hooligans of unknown names led him to Zhou's house to search. He did not have an order from his superiors. He only found blank Flower Fair paper strips and two silver dollars in the civilian's house and took Zhou away. On the way, he met the police officer and handed him over to him. After the officer refused, he took him to the district. The gun he was carrying was taken from Chief Hu of the Fifth Team while drinking at Chief Hu's house. He only brought it to scare people. Director Guan obtained the case file and believed that it involved impersonating an officer, carrying a gun, and illegally entering a civilian's home to arrest him. While he was preparing a document to be sent to the General Bureau for investigation, Su Decai, platoon leader of the Special Task Force directly under the City Security Office, arrived with official letter No. 30, requesting that Wu Jinbiao be brought back for investigation. Director Guan handed Wu Jinbiao over to the coming officers. Zhou Shuncai was temporarily released on bail pending investigation. Yesterday, the seized pistol (unloaded) and three bundles of blank Flower Fair paper strips were submitted to the General Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Gu Buheng, a Person Involved in the Yan Yutang Kidnapping Case, Arrested</h3>
<p>Dongfang Construction Company owner Yan Yutang was kidnapped by bandits on Jiangxi Road at 9 a.m. on May 4th last year and a large ransom was demanded. Hua Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspection Office and others arrested the kidnappers Wang Jian and others, who were sent to the First Special Court for trial and sentencing. After Yan was kidnapped, the bandits hid him in the Doulu brand building at No. 72 Pushi Road in the French Concession. The house was rented by Yu Ziying and guaranteed by the Qingyu Foreign Goods Company at No. 1304 Binlang Road. After the incident, the police went to Qingyu Company to arrest its owner, Gu Buheng (i.e., Gu Yunzhang), but Gu had already fled after hearing the news. Recently, Hua Detective Liu Shaokui and detective Wang Zhusheng of the General Inspection Office discovered that Gu was hiding at the Renchangxiang Foreign Goods Company at No. 378 Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei. They went there yesterday with detectives from the Public Security Bureau and arrested Gu, bringing him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and stated that the police station still needed to investigate and requested that the date be changed. Gu hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Feng核禀 ordered the hearing to be postponed to a later date.</p>
<h3>A Drug Addict in the French Concession Hangs Himself on an Iron Gate</h3>
<p>Liu Mingxing from Yangzhou, 29 years old, a tailor, became unemployed because of his addiction to opium. He asked his mother, Ding (65 years old, living at No. 165 Kaizi'er Road, French Concession), for money to feed his addiction. Recently, his mother's income from her housework was not enough to supply him, and Liu himself had no way to make a living. He often suffered from hunger and cold, and suddenly had a short-sighted idea. Late the night before last, he went to the mouth of the third alley of Taian Lane at the intersection of Beile Road and Aiduo'a Road in the French Concession and hanged himself on the iron gate with a rope. At 5:30 a.m. yesterday morning, a worker sweeping garbage for the Municipal Council discovered the body. The worker went forward to untie him, but the body was already icy cold and he had long been dead. The worker reported it to the police station, which sent the corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. Since there was no way to investigate his surname, name, or family, an anonymous corpse report was submitted to the Second Special District Court, which appointed the chief prosecutor to arrive at the funeral home at noon to examine the body. At that time, the deceased's mother, Liu Ding, had learned of her son's hanging and rushed to the funeral home to identify the body, report his name, and request to claim the body for burial. The official questioned Ding, and then instructed that after examining and verifying that Liu Mingxing had indeed hanged himself, the corpse was allowed to be claimed by the corpse's mother for burial.</p>
<h3>Selling Red Pills Conviction</h3>
<p>Huang Wancheng, a 22-year-old Guangdong youth living at No. 65 Tongkang Lane, Huacheng Road, French Concession, was found carrying four tins of red pills, totaling 4,000 pills, at the entrance of Zhizhong Lane, Xixinqiao Street, at 10:30 a.m. the day before yesterday. Detective Lu Jinxiang discovered the red pills and confiscated them. According to his confession, he bought them from Wang Gengsheng (17 years old, from Liuhe) at No. 124 Xizi Laihuo Street for sale. The detective immediately took him to Wang's place and arrested Wang. He searched his house but found no red pills, but Wang admitted that they were sent by a friend Zheng Aben, who lived in the city, for consignment sales. Zheng was also taken to the police station. After investigating, Zheng was not found. Yesterday afternoon, the case was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, presided over by Judge Wang Gangxu. The police lawyer prosecuted according to Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. The two defendants confessed to selling for profit. The court核供 announced the verdict on the spot, sentencing Huang Wancheng to three months of imprisonment and Wang Gengsheng to six months of imprisonment. The red pills were confiscated.</p>

<p>You A'gen, chief detective of the Laozha Police Station, previously arrested seven male and female bandits, including Wang Lao Jiu, suspected of kidnapping. After investigation, it was found that Wang Lao Jiu and Yao Zhifa were closely related to the murder of Xu Leqing, a broker at the Gauze Exchange. They have been transferred and combined with the bandits arrested in that case for interrogation. In addition, there were three people who had committed serious crimes in the interior. They have been taken away by the City Public Security Bureau. There was also a woman who was released after no criminal behavior was found. Therefore, only one bandit, Zhang Xiong Biao, remained. The special investigation team leader sent by the Seventh District Administrative Inspector of Zhejiang Province came to Shanghai and applied to the First Special District Local Court for transfer. The request was not approved because the team leader did not bring the transfer letter. The court is awaiting the document for further verification. It is known that Zhang Xiong Biao is a long-time bandit rampant in Shengxian County, and he has committed many cases of kidnapping for ransom. Now, the Seventh District Special Commissioner of Zhejiang Province has sent a letter to the First Special Court, stating that the various cases committed by the bandit mostly occurred in Sheng County, and that the Sheng County government is investigating everything. Before a reply is received, please continue to detain the bandit. After a reply is received, another transfer letter will be sent. The Zhejiang Provincial Security Office sent another letter to the court, requesting that the bandit be interrogated directly. Therefore, Judge Feng Youde ordered Zhang Fei to be brought to the table for research yesterday morning. First, the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the arrest process and the extended investigation, and submitted the two badges engraved with [Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department Management Improvement Sericulture Committee] found on Zhang as evidence. Judge Feng immediately inquired with the defendant Zhang Xiong Biao, who confessed, "I was a soldier in the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office before. I deserted and became a bandit. I committed three kidnapping cases in Shengxian County. The first time I kidnapped Zhang Youlao of Zhangjiacun and got a ransom of 1,230 yuan. I received 500 yuan. The second time I kidnapped Xiao Huo Lao of Xiaobai Place and got a ransom of 500 yuan. I received 200 yuan. The third time I kidnapped Gui Zhao of Zhangbowu and got a ransom of only 80 yuan. These three meat tickets were all village chiefs of their respective villages. At that time, it was not kidnapping. Carrying them away. First, my subordinates would take my name card to their homes to demand money. If they refused, I would lead a large group to carry out the arrest after the autumn harvest. I had nearly 100 party members. Government troops once came to appease them. Those of my subordinates who received the appeasement put my name on the list, but I have never received the appeasement. On the fourth day of the first lunar month this year, Shengxian County executed 78 people, including my party members. So, now I am the only one left. When I was arrested, two pistols were found on me. One was mine, and the other was given to me by someone who had already drowned himself. As for the badges that were found, they belonged to my sisters. The plum blossom engraved on the back of the badge is their name." Judge Feng核供 ordered Zhang Xiong Biao to be returned to custody, and another hearing was scheduled.</p>
<h3>Dingxin Sues Lichang Yarn Shop for Fraudulent Sale of Inferior Yarn; Defendant Du Yifang Fails to Appear After Summons; Court Approves Plaintiff's Request for Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>Du Yifang of Lichang Chunji Yarn Shop, located in Ruilin Lane next to the Eddie Road Yarn Exchange, is accused of misrepresenting inferior Japanese-made "Lima" brand yarn from the Datong Spinning Mill as high-quality "Ren Zhong" brand national yarn produced by the Shenxin Yarn Factory. He allegedly altered the tax receipts as well and sold the yarn to the Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Subsequently, Dingxin attempted to exchange the tax receipt for a transportation permit at the tax bureau to ship the goods to Ningbo. However, the tax bureau discovered the alteration and notified Dingxin, revealing Du's deception. As a result, Manager Sun Xinzhu hired lawyer He Ganghou to file a criminal lawsuit against Du Yifang of Lichang Chunji Yarn Shop.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that the defendant forged tax receipts, defrauded tax money, and damaged the plaintiff's reputation. It requests the court to investigate and punish the defendant according to the law and seeks full compensation for damages through an attached civil lawsuit.</p>
<p>The plaintiff states that on May 24th of this year, they submitted a tax receipt for "Ren Zhong" brand 42-count yarn (Huang Zi No. 963, totaling five items) from the Shenxin factory to the Consolidated Tax Bureau to exchange for a transportation permit. The bureau issued a transportation permit for 259 catties. Subsequently, in May, June, and July, they obtained nine additional transportation permits under the same tax receipt. On July 25th, the plaintiff instructed an apprentice to obtain another transportation permit under No. 963 to ship goods to Ningbo. At that time, the tax bureau stated that the No. 963 tax receipt for Shenxin's "Ren Zhong" brand had been altered from a tax receipt for Datong Yarn Factory's "Lima" brand. On July 28th, they received a letter from the Consolidated Tax Bureau stating, "The submitted tax receipt has been altered. A meeting will be held to investigate. Please send a representative to attend and explain the reasons." On August 3rd, they received another letter from the Consolidated Tax Bureau stating, "The name of the factory and brand on the tax receipt you submitted have been altered. A security deposit should be paid."</p>
<p>Upon learning this, the plaintiff was shocked. They verified that the tax receipt was received with the cotton yarn and had supporting documents. Therefore, they personally went to the tax bureau to explain the situation and sent a formal letter clarifying the facts. At the same time, they thoroughly investigated the documents to uncover the truth. They confirmed that the Huang Zi No. 962 tax receipt was purchased from Du Yifang of Lichang Chunji Yarn Shop on May 15th when they purchased the 42-count "Ren Zhong" brand yarn. When they questioned Du Yifang by phone, he gave vague and evasive answers. However, the evidence is clear and undeniable.</p>
<p>The plaintiff argues that the defendant not only used a forged tax receipt but also defrauded the plaintiff's tax money and damaged the plaintiff's reputation. Such a treacherous act must be punished severely to protect honest businesses and prevent fraud. Therefore, the plaintiff believes that the defendant has committed offenses under Articles 233, Paragraph 1, 363, Paragraph 1, and 330 of the Criminal Code. The circumstances are serious and unforgivable. They request the court to issue a summons, investigate the matter according to the law, and impose a sentence to deter wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Consolidated Tax Bureau discovered the altered tax receipt, newspapers have reported the incident of unscrupulous merchants altering tax receipts and deceiving customers with fake national yarn. As a result, the plaintiff has been perceived as one of these merchants, causing significant damage to their reputation and business. The plaintiff estimates the business losses since August to be as high as ten thousand yuan. The plaintiff argues that the defendant should be held fully responsible for these unexpected losses caused by their illegal actions. Therefore, they are filing a supplementary civil lawsuit, requesting the court to order compensation.</p>
<p>The case has been submitted to the Shanghai First Special District Court. The court has issued several summons, but the defendant, Du Yifang, has failed to appear, preventing the trial from proceeding. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi issued another summons, but Du still refused to comply. The plaintiff's lawyer, Yue Minganghou, requested an arrest warrant. The plaintiff also solemnly declared that the defendant was indeed in Shanghai and was deliberately evading the summons. Judge Wu then rescheduled the hearing for 2 PM on October 14th and instructed the plaintiff to bring the defendant, Du Yifang, to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Tragic Abortion of Young Girl Pregnant After Rape; Sent to Hospital for Treatment; Police Investigating</h3>
<p>A young woman named Chu Aqiao, from Hangzhou, is about twenty years old and very attractive. She came to Shanghai from her hometown with her older brother and lives in Hongkou. In June of this year, she was introduced to work at the Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory on Baker Road to earn a living. She was accustomed to going out early and returning late. Xu Wenyao, an employee of the factory and a native of Shaoxing, was known for his lustful nature and often flirted with the women. The factory had once noticed and reprimanded him, but Xu's nature was difficult to change, and he began to seduce Aqiao. Aqiao, young and ignorant, fell into his trap and was repeatedly taken to hotels for secret rendezvous. Unexpectedly, Aqiao became pregnant. Fearing that her growing belly would eventually be noticed by her family, Aqiao pressured Xu to find a solution. Xu then consulted Song Qingyu, a foreman at the factory, and Qian Jinmei (age 27), a Shaoxing native who also worked at the factory. Qian Jinmei consulted her husband, Ding Xing, a Chinese medicine practitioner living at No. 51 Renshou Lane on Baker Road, about abortion methods. Ding recommended Tongji Chun Pharmacy at No. 189 Rihui East Road in the Nanshi area, saying they had a secret formula. Xu and Aqiao went to the pharmacy, but they were still unable to obtain the formula. Finally, Zhu Caifeng (age 46), an old clerk at the pharmacy from Qin Prefecture, introduced them to an old woman named Ji on Xiaoshadu Road who specialized in abortions. They paid nine yuan and had the old woman insert a medicated thread. However, after many days, it was still ineffective. Unexpectedly, Aqiao suffered a misfortune. At around 1 AM yesterday morning, she suddenly experienced severe abdominal pain, turned pale, and bled heavily from her lower body. She was immediately taken by car to Guangci Hospital on Golden Father Road for treatment. According to the Western doctor at the hospital, she was three months pregnant and had attempted an abortion, which was now life-threatening. When questioned, Aqiao recounted the events. The hospital, considering the matter life-threatening, telegraphed the Wenlin Road Police Station in their jurisdiction to investigate the family and report to the Western police chief. The police immediately went to the Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory to arrest Qian Wenyao and Qian Jinmei. Western Detective G.G. Olson, Chinese Detective Jin Wanrong, and Zhang Degong escorted Qian Jinmei. At 10 AM yesterday morning, they, together with Zhang Defu, a patrol officer from the Second District of the Municipal Police Bureau, led police officers to Tongji Pharmacy at No. 189 Rihui East Road and arrested Zhu Caifeng, the old clerk who introduced the abortionist. After registering the case with the district, the Chinese and Western detectives escorted Zhu to Xiaoshadu Road to arrest the old woman Ji and bring her to justice.</p>
<h3>Chen Chengzhi's Unjust Grievance; Falsely Accused of Kidnapping; A Rogue Used as a Fake Victim</h3>
<p>Chen Chengzhi, also known as Chen Yuansheng, a merchant residing at No. 60 Yonghe Lane, Kaifeng Road, North Xizang Road, has become wealthy in recent years due to successful business ventures. He owns bathhouses, reputable shops, a large rickshaw company, and real estate. His wealth has attracted the envy of others. Yang Yunbin, a former detective captain stationed in Shanghai by the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, conspired with former detective captain Jiang Fachang and deputy captain Shi Jinmin to use a rogue named Zhang Dajin as a kidnapping victim from Kunshan. They ordered Zhang to accuse Chen of being the ringleader of the kidnappers. They demanded a large sum of money from Chen. Chen petitioned the Department of Civil Affairs to issue a summons for questioning. Zhang Dajin was unable to answer when asked where he had been kidnapped. Chen was exonerated, and Yang and others went into hiding in Shanghai. Because Chen was falsely accused, he filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting an investigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Yang sent police to Chang'an Road in Zhabei and arrested Yang Yunbin. The others remain at large. A preliminary hearing was held, and Yang Yunbin was ordered to be detained pending the arrest and investigation of the other defendants.</p>
<h3>Postal Bureau Establishes Advertising Postage Regulations for Businesses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, to facilitate the mailing of advertising letters by Shanghai businesses, has established temporary regulations for collecting return postage for business advertising letters. The regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If a Shanghai business wishes to pay the postage for the return of a reply letter or postcard enclosed with its advertising letter, which includes a pre-stamped return envelope or postcard, it must first apply to the Shanghai Postal Administration for registration and obtain a permit. (The business is only responsible for the regular postage fee for the return letter.)</p>
<p>(2) Businesses applying for registration must pay a security deposit of ten yuan in national currency. The Postal Bureau may increase the security deposit at any time as needed. If the business applies for cancellation in the future and returns the permit, the Postal Bureau will refund the full amount after two months.</p>
<p>(3) After obtaining a permit, businesses must prepare return envelopes or postcards according to the format established by the Postal Bureau. The front of the envelope or postcard must clearly indicate the name and address of the business (i.e., the delivery address for the return letter to Shanghai) and the permit number issued by the Shanghai Postal Administration in the lower left corner.</p>
<p>(4) These return letters can only be delivered to the business name and address printed on the letter. If the address is altered, post offices everywhere should refuse to accept the letter.</p>
<p>(5) If the sender of the return letter wishes to send it as registered or express mail, they must prepay the required postage at the time of mailing. If it is sent as regular mail, the post office where it is mailed should stamp it with a postal date stamp. The Shanghai Post Office will then affix postage stamps according to the required postage and cancel them, and deliver the letter to the business to collect the postage.</p>
<p>If the sender of the return letter has already affixed sufficient postage, the originating post office will cancel the stamps, and the Shanghai Post Office will not collect any postage from the business. If the sender has not affixed sufficient postage, the originating post office will cancel the stamps and the Shanghai Post Office will affix additional postage and collect the additional postage from the business.</p>
<p>For return letters from businesses that have been deregistered or have not registered, if the return letter is not stamped or does not have sufficient postage, it should be handled as regular underpaid mail.</p>
<p>(6) The Shanghai Post Office should keep a special register of the names and addresses of businesses that have applied for registration, as well as the date of registration and the permit number. This information should be circulated to all postal districts. When a business is deregistered, the date of deregistration and the permit cancellation number should also be circulated to all postal districts.</p>
<p>(7) If these regulations are incomplete, they will be amended and submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed on the "Xingshi" Steamer; Soldier Attacks Steward</h3>
<p>The "Xingshi" steamer of the Sanbei Steamship Company departed from Hankou for Shanghai on the third of this month. The ship carried a large amount of cargo and many passengers, including a group of armed soldiers. Along the way, passengers and soldiers boarded the ship at Jiujiang and other locations. According to regulations, soldiers traveling by ship were required to pay half fare.</p>
<p>When the ship reached the lower reaches of Anqing, several soldiers forcibly occupied passenger seats. Huang Shengcai, a steward on the ship, negotiated with the soldiers, which angered them. They began to beat Huang. During the conflict, one of the soldiers suddenly drew his bayonet and stabbed Huang repeatedly, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Huang was seriously injured and immediately fell to the deck. The situation became chaotic, and the passengers were terrified.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Police: After the tragedy occurred, the ship's captain and crew intervened to stop the assault. However, because the assailant was an armed soldier, they were unable to arrest him. Instead, they helped the injured steward into a room and identified the assailant, noting his features. They reassured the passengers and informed them that everything was under control. The ship continued to sail as usual, but a wireless message was sent to the Nanjing branch office, requesting that they promptly report to the Capital Garrison Headquarters and request that soldiers be dispatched to the ship upon arrival to arrest and question the assailant. At the same time, the crew was secretly instructed to monitor the assailant and prevent him from escaping.</p>
<p>Apprehending the Assailant: On the sixth, when the "Xingshi" steamer arrived in Nanjing, the Capital Garrison Headquarters, having received the report the previous day, dispatched a platoon of fully armed military police to the Sanbei Wharf to await the ship's arrival. When the ship docked, the military police boarded and secured the exits, preventing anyone from disembarking. After the captain of the ship contacted the commander of the military police, he identified the assailant and the murder weapon, a bayonet. The military police immediately arrested the assailant, along with six or seven other soldiers who were accomplices. It was learned that only the assailant would be tried, while the other soldiers, who were not involved in the assault, would be released.</p>
<p>Report: Huang Shengcai's injuries were severe, and he had lost a significant amount of blood. The "Xingshi" immediately transported Huang to the Love Hospital in Nanjing for treatment. It is currently unknown whether his life is in danger. The captain first telegraphed the Shanghai office about the incident. Yesterday, when the "Xingshi" returned to Shanghai and docked, the captain went to the company and reported the details of the incident to Yu Qiaqing.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Committee Approves Investigation into Fatal Accident at Gold Exchange; Negligence in Management, Disorderly Market, Poor Equipment Endangering Public Safety; Family of Han to Appeal to Beijing</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that a fatal accident at the Municipal Gold Exchange, caused by poor equipment, a disorderly market, and negligence in management, resulted in the death of Han Shuyao, who was there to conduct business. The Han family believes that Han's death was not accidental and that the exchange authorities have not only concealed the name of the perpetrator but have also sent letters to a newspaper in an attempt to deny the facts and mislead the public. Therefore, they have petitioned the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to demand justice and strict action.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Municipal Party Committee, after learning of the situation, replied to Han Hongshi, stating: "Your petition concerning the fatal accident at the Gold Exchange due to negligence in management, disorderly market, and concealment of the perpetrator has been received. The issue of poor equipment and negligence in management endangering public safety should be investigated and handled jointly with the competent authorities." It is also reported that the Han family, in addition to actively pursuing their demands with the Municipal Party Committee and the Bureau of Social Affairs, is also planning to appeal to the Public Concession authorities and, in the coming days, will personally take the deceased's elderly mother and orphaned children to Beijing to make a strong appeal to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, demanding that the exchange be shut down.</p>

<h3>Remarriage Case of Young Woman Continues: Both Parties Request Investigation of Evidence</h3>
<p>Jia Lin, a woman from Anji, Zhejiang, who previously worked at the Health Bureau, suddenly fell in love with Lin Xianjian, the chairman of the Xianjian Hospital, who is from Dong Jieyang, during the most intense period of the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War last spring. They began living together as husband and wife. On July 24th of this year, she secretly went to the capital and married Wu Bin (courtesy name Chuba), a staff member of the First Section of the Jiangsu Provincial Government from Anhui, at the World Hotel. She then wrote to Lin Xianjian, declaring the termination of their cohabitation relationship. However, Lin argued that Jia was his legal wife, so how could she remarry? He then wrote to Jia and Wu, inviting them to come to Shanghai, and accused them of adultery. After repeated summons by the First Special District Court, which has been reported in previous newspapers, Feng Shide, the presiding judge, continued the hearing yesterday morning. The only witness summoned was Ma Fengting, the gatekeeper of Fuxing Road, Laobaizi Road, who appeared in court. Others, such as Dr. Yang, sent a letter from the Hangzhou Municipal Hospital, stating that his leave was not approved and he could not attend. Judge Feng considered that the photo of Jia Lin in her wedding attire, presented by Lin, was the most important evidence, so he repeatedly questioned Lin about the photo studio and the number of photos taken. According to Lin, there were originally two photos, but one, kept in his hometown, had been torn up by his brother. He also presented two letters, saying that these two letters were from Jia's friends to Jia, calling Jia [Teacher Lin Xianjian's wife]. If Jia was not married to me, why would they call her that? In addition, Jia's letter to [text obscured] also called me her husband, which should be noted. Jia Lin immediately argued that she lived with him for a year, and from a human point of view, even if it was concubinage, in order to save face, she would not want to call him her lover. However, in legal terms, marriage requires a public ceremony and the testimony of more than two people to establish a marital relationship. If only the address is used, would friends calling each other brother or brother also be considered siblings and be able to divide property? Surely there is no such reason. Then, Ma Fengting was questioned. Unexpectedly, Ma's testimony was mostly confused and contradictory. In the end, both parties requested further investigation of the evidence. Neither side showed weakness. Judge Feng also believed that further investigation was necessary and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Yesterday (6th), your newspaper's local news column published an article titled "Trial of Kidnapper Gu Junshan." The article stated that the kidnapper confessed that he is currently serving as a messenger for Detective Wang of the headquarters. On the eighth of last month, he came to Shanghai with Wang and stayed in the Longhua Military Police Camp. On the sixteenth, Detective Wang issued him a live ammunition handgun in the office of the Military Police Camp and instructed him to go to the French Concession at 8:00 AM to arrest communists. He also confessed that he came to Shanghai last year and, in April of this year, joined the party soldiers of the Second Company, First Battalion, Eighty-Eighth Regiment in Longhua. One month later, he was sent to Nanshu. Subsequently, he was recommended by a fellow villager to Detective Wang and came to Yang with Wang to handle a case. After that, he transferred to Shanghai with eight people and stayed in the Longhua Military Police Camp. Upon investigation, the confession of the kidnapper Gu Junshan is inconsistent with the facts in the following four points: (1) There is no such person as Detective Wang in the headquarters, and there is no such position as detective. (2) There were no Wang and others from the capital staying in the Military Police Camp in the middle of last month. (3) No troops of the Eighty-Eighth Division have been stationed in Longhua since the January 28th Incident last year. (4) Whenever the headquarters sends personnel to the concession to arrest criminals, they must first consult with the police station. Therefore, the confession of the kidnapper is completely inconsistent with the facts. Please publish this letter as a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Adjutant Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 7th): Zhao Wenzao, the head of the Hebei delegation, along with ninety male athletes, fifty-one female athletes, and thirty staff members, arrived in the capital on the morning of the 7th. According to him, the province has budgeted 10,000 yuan for travel expenses, which is sufficient. Among the athletes with the most potential are Li Baoming and Han Jinglin in sprinting. Han achieved a time of 11.2 seconds in the 100-meter race at the North China Games. Zheng Sen's 1500-meter time is 4 minutes and 14 seconds, setting a new national record. Zhao Enzhu's decathlon score is around 5,100 points. Wu Bixian's high jump of 1.82 meters is also one of the new national records. In addition, although the men's and women's basketball and volleyball teams have a slight reputation, they will face formidable opponents such as the Philippines, Hubei, Guangdong, and Hong Kong. It is still unknown who will emerge victorious. Li Luanding, in women's swimming, is dominant in North China, but she may not be a match for Hong Kong and Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Shandong's Strength Is Better for Women Than for Men</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th): The Shandong athletes arrived at 11:00 PM on the 6th, together with the Northeast athletes. The head of the delegation is Yang Pengfei, and the general instructor is Shang Shumei. When reporters interviewed them on the evening of the 7th, Mr. Yang was asked about the reliability of Zhao Dehua's new national record of 35 minutes and 27 seconds in the 10,000-meter race during the Shandong preliminary selection. According to him, it is very reliable. However, Zhao is from a poor family and has few opportunities to practice. According to experts, if he can get adequate training, he can be expected to break through the 35-minute barrier. If so, he has a great chance of winning the 10,000-meter championship. He also said that during the summer vacation, Ms. Shi Tianzhen stayed in Beijing for more than a month due to the university entrance exam. She was ill for half a month due to being unaccustomed to the climate and food, so she was unable to participate in the provincial preliminary selection. Although she participated in the second preliminary selection, her performance was reduced due to her illness. Now she has recovered. In terms of performance, the women are better than the men. A total of 96 male and female athletes are participating this time. Shandong's sports have been lagging behind. In the past three years, after Shang Shumei became the head of the Shandong Provincial Sports Field, she has made great efforts to promote sports, and there has been much progress.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang's Athletes Have Average Strength</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th): The Zhejiang National Games athletes and staff, totaling 142 people, arrived in the capital last night. According to Chen Baiqing, the head of the delegation, the strength of the ball sports is average. Although there is no hope of winning a championship, there will definitely be a good performance. In men's track and field, Chen Hanzhang is the most outstanding in sprinting. He showed his talent at the Zhejiang Games, with a time of 11.4 seconds in the 100-meter race, about 24 seconds in the 200-meter race, and about 54 seconds in the 400-meter race. He has special skills in pole vaulting, with a height of 3.23 meters. Leng Peiji in the triathlon, although a newcomer, has a three-point Peigen style. In the women's field, Zheng Xuehua's running and jumping are still worth watching.</p>
<p>(Hangzhou, 7th): The Zhejiang athletes attending the National Games include 17 men and 15 women in track and field, 4 in swimming, 7 in martial arts, 5 in tennis, 9 in basketball, and 12 in volleyball. At 7:00 AM on the 7th, due to the rain, the flag-awarding and swearing-in ceremony was held at the Senior High School. Governor Lu of the Provincial Government personally awarded the flag, and Captain Ouyang Xuhui accepted the flag on behalf of the team. Then they went to the Cheng Zhan to take a train to Shanghai and then to the capital.</p>
<h3>Survey of Hunan Province's Athletes' Strengths</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th): The Hunan Province delegation to the National Games, consisting of 127 athletes, departed from Changsha on the 3rd and arrived in Wuhan at 8:00 AM on the 4th.

Huang Shuhua took the Taiyuan line on the 6th. According to Fujian basketball, the Jimei team defeated Liangjiang 33 to 17 this summer and went to Nanyang, winning all 17 matches.

<h3>Philippine Basketball Team Went to the Capital Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Repeatedly Question the Authorities of the National Games:</h3>
<p>| Why Was the Preliminary Group List Leaked First? |</p>
<p>If the Allocation Stock Staff are Not Removed and Investigated</p>
<p>The Newspapers and the Conference Will Adopt a Non-Cooperative Doctrine</p>
<p>If the News Needs to be Bought for Money, the Price Should be Marked First</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongfan and other allocation stock staff members of the National Games previously sold news privately to make a profit, which caused the dissatisfaction of the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Pingjin news circles. The question was raised, and Guo Lianfeng, the director of the publicity group, made a statement and stipulated a unified method to ensure that the same incident would not happen again in the future. The newspapers also reluctantly tolerated it for the sake of protecting the conference, and they lived in peace. However, after a few days, the list of the track and swimming group preliminaries was first discovered in a newspaper, which is really confusing. If the news of the conference needs to be bought for money to be obtained, the conference authorities should first weigh the importance of each piece of news, estimate the price, and sell it publicly to show fairness. The allocation stock staff members of the conference are greedy, shameless, and extremely illegal. They should be removed and investigated immediately to warn future generations and to thank the colleagues in the national news circles, and to rectify the discipline of the conference. Otherwise, the newspapers will resolutely adopt a completely non-cooperative doctrine with the conference. The situation is serious and has reached the extreme. Unified publicity is the rule announced by the conference, but the staff members of the conference themselves have violated the law first. If they are not severely punished, it is unimaginable. This matter is related to the government's credibility. I hope the conference will not treat it indifferently.</p>
<p>Guo Lianfeng, Director of the Propaganda Group, Resigned Suddenly</p>
<h3>Zhang Xinful Manipulates News</h3>
<p>▲Guo Lianfeng Bitterly Speaks of the Course of Toleration</p>
<p>(Nanjing 7th dispatch) The sudden publication of the order of the All-China Games and the list of athlete numbers in a few newspapers caused disputes in the press. Today, a part of the program was published in a certain newspaper, which is bound to cause resentment from the press and the All-China Games. Guo Lianfeng, director of the Propaganda Group, felt extremely troubled in handling affairs, and suddenly resigned from the conference, and stated that he would not go to the meeting to work from today. Last night, Mr. Guo issued a responsible statement saying that this All-China Games is grand in scale and complex in organization. Colleagues in the Ministry of Education had long known that it would be difficult to achieve perfection. Various problems and disputes have been numerous during the preparation period. Colleagues in the Ministry of Education have repeatedly tolerated. The news of the conference originally had no need to be kept secret. However, the publication of news should strive for universality. Various programs, if they need to be published, should also be handed over to various newspapers for simultaneous publication. However, base and despicable means are deliberately used to manipulate, so that the press unanimously attacks the conference. Since the deadline for registration, the Propaganda Group has been urging the Competition Committee to copy the program and publish it. At first, it was deliberately delayed, saying that it had not been compiled. When the newspaper made a severe statement, public opinion was in an uproar. I repeatedly asked the program to be handed over to the Propaganda Group for official publication. However, according to Zhang Xinful, this program must be officially announced on the 8th of this month. Therefore, until today, I have not seen the conference program except for the newspaper's publication. On the evening of the 6th, I heard that a certain newspaper had obtained this material. I requested that the entire program be announced in advance to avoid disputes, but it was ultimately ineffective. I am unable to handle it, and I should resign from my post. Therefore, I have decided that from today, I will not go to the meeting to work. All the duties of the director of the Propaganda Group have been entrusted to Mr. Peng Baichuan, director of the Document Group, to temporarily take over, and wait for the conference to find a suitable candidate to avoid delaying the conference affairs, and so on.</p>
<h3>Ping Athletes Can Arrive in Beijing Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing 7th Central News Agency) One-third of the delegations from various provinces and cities to the All-China Games have arrived in Beijing, with more than 600 male and female athletes. Other teams are also on the way. Those who can arrive in Beijing on the 8th include the delegations from the Philippines, Shanghai, Ping, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Suiyuan provinces.</p>
<h3>Liu Changchun Talks About His Performance</h3>
<p>▲No Certainty of Scoring in the Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing 7th dispatch) Liu Changchun and other athletes from the five units of Northeast Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Harbin, and Rehe arrived in Beijing by train the night before yesterday. The head of the delegation, Mr. Hu Anshan, said that the athletes sent by the five units in the Northeast were hosted by the Northeast Sports Association, and the funds were raised from various sources, about 8,000 yuan, which was sufficient to cover the travel expenses for attending the All-China Games. Liu Changchun, the captain of the Liaoning team, and Wu Jingyao's sprints are more promising. Liu Renxiu's decathlon, Wei Fuzhen's high hurdles, and Jiang Yunlong's middle distance have also been quite impressive in peacetime. The female team member Niu Runquan only joined the 100-meter and 200-meter events. It is uncertain whether she will be able to score in the future. Due to the environment and financial constraints in the Northeast, there is no hope for various championships. This participation in the All-China Games is just to express the spirit of national unity, to temper the physique of the entire nation, and to plan for the recovery of lost territories. According to Liu Changchun, he is currently working in the Department of Hygiene and Education of Northeastern University and continues to work hard for track and field events. This time he participated in the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter events, as well as the 1,600-meter relay. In recent years, the Chinese people have attached importance to sports, so talents have emerged in large numbers. For example, Zhong Lianji in Shanghai and He Peigen in Guangdong both have 100-meter results of less than 11 seconds, which can be called strong opponents. When I participated in the North China Games, I ran 11 seconds in the 100 meters and 22.4 seconds in the 200 meters. There are no definite records in recent practice. I am not sure whether I will be able to score in the conference in the future.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Head Coach Hao Gengsheng's Speech</h3>
<p>▲Participation Is Not About Championship</p>
<p>▲The Purpose Is to Promote Sports</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, the head coach of Qingdao, led the team's staff and athletes, a total of 39 people, including 17 national martial arts athletes, and arrived in Beijing by Jinpu train on the evening of the 6th. According to him, the purpose of the team's participation in the All-China Games this time is not to hope for championships. I feel that the greatest purpose of the All-China Games is to enable the people of the whole country to express the spirit of unity and cooperation. The All-China Games can be a touchstone for unity and cooperation. The reason why any cause in China is not on the right track is that the entire nation lacks this spirit. Championships are just incentives to promote sports. In the event that this conference does not have a satisfactory result of cooperation among various units, Chinese sports will be over from now on. The team does not pay attention to whether it can score in the competition, because there are fewer schools in Qingdao and not many sports talents. It is impossible to compare with Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong. However, this is an opportunity to gain some sports experience and use it as a reference for future efforts. Although Qingdao's women's swimming won the championship in the North China Games, they ask themselves that they cannot compete with Hong Kong and Guangdong. In other track and field events, it is enough to get one or two places. The team list is specially recorded below.</p>
<p>Head Coach Hao Gengsheng</p>
<p>Female Instructor and Administrator Shen Ruizhen</p>
<p>Female Instructor and Administrator Gao Zi</p>
<p>Male Instructor and Administrator Song Junfu</p>
<p>Male Instructor and Administrator Gu Shou</p>
<p>National Martial Arts Instructor Xiang Zongding</p>
<p>National Martial Arts Administrator Han Guanzhou</p>
<p>Administrator Yan Taoying</p>
<p>Administrator Zhang Yixian</p>
<p>Administrator Liu Ailian</p>
<h3>Chief Referee Zhang Boling Arrived in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing 7th Central News Agency) Zhang Boling, the chief referee of the conference, arrived in Beijing from Tianjin on the 7th. According to him, this kind of grand meeting is the first time it has been convened in the capital, and the number of people and the number of units have broken all past records. This is a symbol of encouraging morale and promoting unity, and it can also show that social culture has made progress. I only hope that the weather will clear up so that the conference can be successfully concluded, and I hope that all athletes can pay attention to the spirit of sports. I hold the hope of listening to lawsuits, I am still human, I must make no lawsuit, and I hope that there will be no disputes in the conference. The referee committee, the competition committee, and the judgment committee will convene meetings within a few days to plan the progress, and it is also planned to reorganize the National Sports Association during the conference.</p>
<h3>Ma Liang Passed Through Xuzhou Yesterday to Attend the Meeting</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou 7th dispatch) In the days leading up to the opening of the All-China Games, athletes from various provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, passed through Xuzhou and went south to participate. Ma Liang also passed through Xuzhou from Jinan in the evening to go to Beijing to serve as a referee for the All-China Games. Ma said that national martial arts should learn practical skills and not just empty forms.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Was Sunny Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Athletes' Life Is Thriving</p>
<p>▲Playing Around Linggu Temple</p>
<p>(Nanjing 7th dispatch) The male and female athletes who have arrived at the Central Sports Field, because it is far from the city and there are no vehicles to ride, and because of the continuous rainy days, even walking nearby feels like a bitter experience. They can only huddle in their pigeon-hole rooms with no fun. On the 7th, the weather was slightly sunny, and the male and female athletes' interest in playing began. Linggu Temple and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum near the venue are excellent places to visit. Along the way, the red leaves of the autumn mountains reflected each other after the rain, making one feel refreshed. At dusk, there were still two or three men and women wandering under the pine and willow trees, enjoying themselves and forgetting to return. However, the trees on Zijin Mountain are very lush, and there are many blue wolves. The mausoleum guards and hunters all know this. In the event that you do not return at dusk, be careful of being swallowed by them. Please pay attention. After the rain, the track and field is even more difficult to walk on. A group of eager male and female athletes were acting out short sprints to practice their starting points to kill time. In addition, those who huddle in their pigeon-hole rooms are in the midst of a sweet dream. As soon as they hear that this newspaper has arrived, they rush to read it with sleepy eyes.</p>
<h3>Opening Parade Sequence</h3>
<p>▲Shanghai Is Tenth</p>
<p>(Nanjing 7th dispatch) The order of each unit during the parade is: 1. Xinjiang, 2. Shanxi, 3. Sichuan, 4. Anhui, 5. Guangdong, 6. Gansu, 7. Jiangsu, 8. Jiangxi, 9. Qinghai, 10. Shanghai, 11.

<h3>Winning the Football Championship for Two Consecutive Terms</h3>
<p>Awarded the Golden Halberd by Chairman Lin</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Award Certificate Was Shipped to the Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing 7th Central News Agency) Chairman Lin presented a golden halberd to the All-China Games, which has been manufactured by the Printing and Minting Bureau. Several staff members shipped it to the conference office on the 7th, along with an award certificate. The golden halberd is worth more than 600 yuan and took two months to cast. The size and style are generally based on the Zhou Dynasty system. The halberd price and halberd handle are both five feet high, and the rest is made of mahogany and vermilion lacquer. The halberd end is made of silver and gilded on the outside. One side is cast with the words "Awarded by the National Government to the All-China Games," and the other side is cast with the words "Made in the 22nd year of the Republic of China." This award is presented to the football competition team that has won two consecutive terms. It is said that Chairman Lin also presented other awards, which will be sent to the conference as soon as they are made. The full text of the golden halberd award certificate is as follows: National Government Award Certificate Shengzi No. 1. The National Government awards a golden halberd to the All-China Games in the 22nd year of the Republic of China as an award for the football team competition that has won two consecutive terms. It has been found that the team of (blank) is the best in this year's football team competition, and this certificate is hereby given to show encouragement. October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government.</p>
<h3>The Football Field Is Too Simple</h3>
<p>▲In the Future, the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangdong Triangular Final</p>
<p>▲Should Be Moved to the Track and Field</p>
<p>(Nanjing 7th dispatch) The football competition of this conference is expected to be very intense, and the organizers of the conference have received many public and private letters from fans along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway inquiring about the final date. It is expected that the audience will be crowded. The three ports of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong are famous for football in the country, and the three teams have never had the opportunity to meet and compete. Therefore, this conference is a rare opportunity. However, the various field facilities of the Central Sports Field are very complete, but the football field is particularly simple. The ground is low-lying, and it is full of rainwater after a long period of rain. There is no place to stand around, and there is only one row of stands, which can only accommodate about 500 people. Such a grand football competition is inevitably disappointing due to the lack of beauty of the field. However, track and field and all-around sports will end on the 15th. It is hoped that the football competition after the 15th will be moved to the solemn and magnificent track and field for the competition.</p>
<h3>19th Standing Committee Meeting of the All-China Games Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>After the Rain, Prohibit Athletes From Practicing Arbitrarily in the Field</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province's Late Registration Is Approved to Be Included in the Order Book</p>
<p>Central University Borrows Gymnasium as Athletes' Dormitory</p>
<p>Appoint Members of the Award Committee and Schedule a Meeting for the 11th</p>
<p>At 7:00 p.m. on the 6th, the All-China Games Preparatory Committee held its 19th Standing Committee meeting in the Ministry of Education. All Standing Committee members and heads of groups and sections attended. Chu Minyi chaired the meeting as follows:</p>
<p>A. Reporting Matters</p>

However, from the afternoon of that day (the 10th), the rostrum will be changed to the special platform at the entrance of the conference (facing east), and the special platform opposite it (facing west) will be used as an ordinary special viewing platform. Please inform all staff members to pay attention. 7. Athletes have been arriving in Beijing one after another. The road from the venue to the canteen has been almost impossible to walk on due to continuous rain. Please ask the Transportation Group to hire more workers to complete the two roads that have been improved and the original road that has been repaired before noon tomorrow (the 7th) to facilitate walking. 8. The canteen dormitory is not enough for 4500 people. It was originally planned to build two reed mat sheds, but the reed mat shops refused to undertake the project for various reasons. It was unavoidable to find ways to add iron beds to the aisles of the venue dormitory, which can accommodate about 200 more people. President Luo of Central University has been consulted to borrow the gymnasium of Central University as a dormitory. The required beds have been sponsored by Sun Guichang of the 88th Division and agreed by the Barracks Management Office. Two hundred double iron beds from the Xiaolingwei barracks will be borrowed, which is enough for more than 400 people. However, the vehicles for the athletes living in the gymnasium of Central University every day should be prepared in advance by the Transportation Group. 9. The list of athletes who have arrived so far is as follows:</p>
<p>Province/City Male Female Total</p>
<p>Shanxi 56 6 62</p>
<p>Sichuan 88 17 105</p>

<h3>Two Tennis Players from Java</h3>
<p>Xu Chengji and Lin Xuyin</p>
<p>Will Arrive in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Chengji (originally Xinji) and Mr. Lin Xuyin, two famous overseas Chinese tennis players from Java, were sponsored and sent back to China by the Batavian Chinese Tennis Association to participate in the National Games. They departed from Batavia on the 28th of last month aboard the Zini Canada of the Java Company. The two gentlemen will arrive in Shanghai this morning. The following is an introduction to their resumes:</p>
<h3>Xu Chengji</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Chengji is a rising star in the Javanese tennis world. Originally from Fujian, he won the Central Java championship in 1929. In 1930, he rose to fame and won the All-Java singles championship. In 1932, he and Mr. Lin Xuyin won the All-Java doubles championship. In 1933, he won the All-Java championship again.

<h3>Two Tennis Players from Java</h3>

<p>All-Java doubles championship. In 1933, he won the All-Java championship again. Last year, when the famous Shanghai player Qiu Feihai visited Java, he was defeated by Mr. Xu twice. Mr. Xu's tennis skills have long been widely praised. His</p>
<p>serving posture does not involve bending over, but is rapid and swift like lightning. His ball pressure is also</p>
<p>A group photo of tennis players Xu Chengji (left) and Lin Xuyin (right) from Batavia. The same is true for his volleys. Other skills such as topspin drives, volleys, passing shots, and half-volleys are all top-notch.</p>
<h3>Lin Xuyin</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Xuyin, originally from Fujian, is an overseas Chinese student from Malang, Java. He is a pioneer of tennis among overseas Chinese in Java. In 1926, he won the Malang singles championship. In 1930 and 1931, he won the East Java singles championship. In 1932, he and Xu Chengji won the All-Java doubles championship. Mr. Lin's tennis skills are characterized by his slightly stout physique, so he rarely rushes to the net. However, he is more steady than Xu. His topspin drive is a forehand topspin drive from the baseline. Although the ball is slow, it is not easy to handle. In addition, Mr. Lin is also good at volleys. I remember that when he played against Sun Defei, the current West Java champion, years ago, his strategy for defeating his opponent was to first force his opponent to the left and right corners, making him exhausted from running, and then use a volley technique to hit the ball only inches from the net. Other hitting techniques are more than steady, but not fast or urgent. This is probably related to his age and physique.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Hong Kong Athletes Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The Guangdong and Hong Kong athletic delegations that have attracted much attention are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The ship carrying the Hong Kong delegation, the Zini Canada, is expected to arrive at the port at 8:00 AM.

<p>The Hunan Provincial Delegation to the National Games passed through Hankou on the 4th en route to Nanjing. While on the ship, they met with Song Ruhai and others, officials of the Hankou Sports Association. They discussed the fact that sports in Central China are backward and disorganized, and that there is an urgent need to organize a Central China Sports Federation to promote sports. They convened a discussion meeting on the Jiangshun ship, attended by more than ten people including Chen Kuishi, He Jingwei, Huang Fengqi, Peng Zepei, Lu Jixu, Fang Kegang (representing Fang Jiping), He Jiasheng, Kuang Shushu, Wang Youran, and Hu Yiru from Hunan Province, and Yuan Ling, Liu Changhe, Song Ruhai, Tang Dingxiang, and Zeng Zichen from Hubei Province.

<h3>Athletes from Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers College</h3>
<p>12 Representatives from Shanghai</p>
<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers College in Jiangwan has long enjoyed a renowned reputation in Shanghai. The students of this college were selected to represent Shanghai at this National Games in greater numbers than students from other schools. Pan Yueying, captain of the women's softball team and also a basketball player; Ma Ji, shot put and discus; Gan Hongying, javelin; Zou Shandie, high jump and long jump, and softball; Li Yinan, 100-meter and 200-meter, track and field, softball; Xiang Shaofen, softball; Liao Zhuyuan, softball; Qin Ruizhen, softball; Wen Yueyuan, softball. It is said that Ma Ji is certain to win first place in shot put at the National Games. Zou Shandie's high jump, Li Yinan's 200-meter, Gan Hongying's javelin, and Xu Wenying's shot put are all very likely to score points.</p>
<h3>Students from Two Sports Schools to Visit the National Games</h3>
<p>▲Jiangnan Physical Education Teachers College</p>
<p>Wang Fudan, the principal of Jiangnan Physical Education Teachers College on Hede Road, Shanghai, believes that the complete facilities and grand scale of this National Games held in the Mausoleum area are something that students cannot learn in the curriculum or see in books. Therefore, he has ordered all students to depart for Nanjing by express train this morning to visit the National Games, in order to conduct on-site research and broaden their horizons.</p>
<p>▲Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teachers College</p>
<p>Since the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teachers College moved back to its new campus on Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, this semester, the number of students has increased dramatically due to the sound facilities, and talented people have emerged. In addition to the women's basketball team, which represents Shanghai, many of the school's students have also been selected to represent Shanghai in other track and field events at the National Games. The athletes will depart for Nanjing today with the Shanghai delegation. Principal Lu Lihua believes that the National Games are of great importance to sports and that the holding of the games in the capital is a rare opportunity. Therefore, in order to enhance the students' experience and knowledge, it is necessary for them to visit the games in person. More than 100 students are scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM tomorrow. It is also heard that Yang Ren, Xiang Dawei, and Fang Qiaosheng, former graduates of the school, will also lead the Anhui and Hunan women's delegations to Beijing to participate. The school previously announced in the newspaper that a grand reunion would be held for all graduates on Double Tenth Day (October 10th), which may be realized at this time.</p>
<h3>The Content of the "East China Sports Magazine" is Rich</h3>
<p>The "East China Sports Magazine," published by the East China Sports Association, is scheduled to be launched on Double Ten Day. The content is rich, the cover is in three colors, and it includes the posture of Duke of Park. The articles include the history of East China, Jiang Xiangqing's advocacy of social sports issues, Wang Fudan's advocacy of social sports and the need to establish more social sports associations, Lu Xiangqian's "Heroes of Suzhou and Shanghai in Turmoil," predictions for the National Games, Jiang Huaiqing's "Autumn Harvest of Japanese Athletics," and Chen Jinjiang's "Past and Present Views of the Shanghai Chinese and Western Football Circles."

<h3>Central Library to be Completed Next Month</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th dispatch) The construction project of the Central Library, which began in July, is now nearing completion. The library is divided into two floors and can store 400,000 volumes. The upper level can accommodate 900 readers. It is expected to be completed by the end of next month.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Stipulates the Construction of Educational Institution Buildings</h3>
<p>(Anqing Dispatch) The Anhui Education Department, in view of the fact that the annual expenditure on temporary repairs to buildings by various provincial educational institutions amounts to tens of thousands of yuan, a considerable sum in the long run, which wastes public funds without practical benefit, recently sent personnel to inspect various educational institutions in order to find a fundamental solution. According to the results of the inspection, it was found that most of the schools in Anhui Province were converted from official offices, examination halls, and Confucius temples of the Qing Dynasty. Those that were specially built were also simple and crude, and many were not suitable for school use. Even schools that were considered to be relatively large in scale, such as the First Middle School and the Sixth Middle School, were mostly built thirty years ago and had long exceeded their warranty period. Tilting and collapse are imminent. Therefore, the thorough repair and construction of school buildings is currently an urgent task. In addition, the increased number of classes in various schools requires the addition of school buildings. According to the estimation of the personnel sent, it is difficult to spend this huge sum within one year. The Education Department intends to formulate a plan for the reconstruction of school buildings in various schools on a yearly basis, referring to the minimum needs of each school and taking into account the economic conditions of Anhui Province. This plan was approved by the provincial government meeting the day before yesterday and handed over to the Education and Finance Departments for consultation and implementation.</p>
<p>This City</p>
<h3>Director Gu of the Ministry of Education Scheduled</h3>
<p>to Come to Shanghai on the 15th to Inspect Education</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai Yesterday for Private Matters and Returned to Beijing Today</p>
<p>Gu Shusen, Director of the General Education Department of the Ministry of Education, came to Shanghai yesterday to attend to private matters and returned to Beijing today. He is scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 15th of this month to inspect education in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Education's funding for Mongolian and Tibetan education was originally 500,000 yuan, but recently, due to financial difficulties, the Ministry of Education, together with the Ministry of Finance and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, reduced it to more than 200,000 yuan. Once approved and allocated, various plans will be implemented. In addition, there have been many disputes in various places regarding the recent joint entrance examinations for primary and secondary school graduates. The Ministry of Education is now ordering all provinces and cities to report on the process of the joint examinations, to collect statistics and conduct research, so that the joint examination methods can be further improved, and the examinations will continue to be held next year.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>There are only three kinds of people in the world who don't walk. One is an infant in swaddling clothes, held in his mother's arms, who doesn't need to walk. One is a crippled person with a lame foot, who can't walk even with crutches. One is a rich person, with their own motorcars, airplanes, who, except for circling indoors, really don't need to exert those precious feet. Standing in the opposite position to those three kinds of people are rickshaw pullers and messengers. What they exert the most is a pair of miserable feet. If they don't walk for a day, they go hungry for a day. They rely on their feet, rely on walking, to barely manage to survive day after day. However, some people say that modern messengers ride bicycles and don't need to walk. I think riding a bicycle with two feet is about the same as walking, just a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>People without money, except for long-distance travel where they have no choice but to use boats and vehicles, use their feet for going to and from work every day, visiting relatives, and finding friends. On the one hand, it is indeed to save money, but on the other hand, there is also a benefit. According to the theory of evolution, [the more the limbs and parts of the body, hair, claws, and teeth are used, the more powerful they become; if they are not used, they will be eliminated.] Taking our claws, teeth, and hair to prove it, it seems somewhat credible. If people sit in boats and vehicles and don't walk, their feet will be useless. If this is inherited generation after generation, wouldn't they be eliminated and become footless creatures? In this way, the people who walk are the great contributors to preserving their feet and the pioneers of eugenics!</p>
<p>There are two completely different mentalities among people who walk in Shanghai. One is in favor of walking, and they say that the roads in Shanghai couldn't be flatter and cleaner. They are paved with asphalt, and on sunny days there are water trucks that don't raise dust; on rainy days there are drainage ditches that don't accumulate water. Not to mention that it is comfortable to walk on, even lying down on it won't get you any dust. At night, the street lamps are as bright as day, so you won't bump into walls or fall into the outhouse. If you don't walk on such a road, aren't you wasting your blessings? One is against walking, and they say that the road is like a tiger's mouth, and walking is very dangerous. Every day, so many people are killed by cars and streetcars, and there are electric wires falling from the sky that can kill you if you touch them; sometimes the police are catching thieves and bandits, and there is a risk of getting hit by stray bullets. On a smaller scale, if you look into a store, the things in your bag will disappear without a trace. If you accidentally bump into a gangster, he will drag you to a hot water stall and argue over every penny. It is better to take a vehicle to avoid all unnecessary sacrifices. Which of these two reasons is right? Please let the readers judge!</p>
<p>The human heart is never satisfied. Walking is considered slow, so people want to ride horses. Riding horses is still considered slow, so they have to switch to motorcars. People are also greedy for comfort. Take myself for example. In the countryside, without cars, running ten or eight miles is nothing. When I get to Shanghai, for even a short distance, it's either a rickshaw, a streetcar, or a bus. No one is willing to walk leisurely anymore. Therefore, talking about walking in the city is rare and precious. Except for athletes in 10,000-meter races who are willing to open up their strides and run forward, who else is willing to walk ten or eight miles?</p>
<h3>Jiangwan in Early Autumn</h3>
<p>Gu Xizhang</p>
<p>The flames of the sun are not as fierce as they used to be, and the cries of cicadas are as faint as a wisp of silk.</p>
<p>Modern misses are adding brightly colored vests to their light silk cheongsams.</p>
<p>Ah! New autumn is quietly sneaking into the world, following the dusk, no wonder I seem to feel a bit chilly in the early morning and evening when wearing a single layer of clothing.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? On the edge of the fields in the countryside, piles of new rice are piled up like pagoda spires, and cotton as white as snow has already been discovered in the Jiangwan market. This is the price of the autumn harvest that farmers have irrigated with a year's worth of effort and labor.</p>
<p>I remember, I remember deeply, last autumn, I came from City X on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to mourn this post-calamity town. At that time, the murmuring swallows also flew from the northern border to this southern land of calamity, searching under the eaves and on the beams for the nest they had built last year. [Swallows! Your old nest was destroyed by the artillery fire of the Japanese soldiers long ago. Where are you going to find it? Swallows! You are homeless, why don't you go back to the north?] I once silently wanted to say to the flying swallows.</p>
<p>Swallows! This year you have once again followed the new autumn from the once war-torn north to the old land of Jiangnan. Swallows! You may also have the feeling of [the world is so big, there is no place to stand].</p>
<p>Swallows, please take your trouble again, rebuild your new nest, and spend that cool autumn life with me again in the post-calamity Jiangwan.</p>
<p>Miscellany</p>
<h3>On Zhongshan Road</h3>
<p>— Li Pengxiang</p>
<p>According to a friend who is afraid of his wife [in their eyes, the family is a prison; only the land outside the family gate is the world they own.]</p>
<p>A lecture draft by a writer ridiculed [a woman is Gog]. A person reading his posthumous manuscript suspected that the printing house had inverted the word Dog.</p>
<p>A husband who has been tamed by his wife always blames his friends for leading him astray if he goes astray outside. He will never think about the reason why the husband went out.</p>
<p>A woman's heart is like the white clouds in the sky, she will be pushed by whichever direction the wind is strong. Those with weak winds should avoid them early; otherwise, they will suffer unexpected disasters. (Anfu)</p>
<p>From Little Wa Rita Village.</p>
<p>Zhongshan Road lies straight, without a sound. It turns out it's asleep. It's dreaming: the clatter of horseshoes, the speeding of cars, the footsteps of female workers.</p>
<h3>[Referring to One's Father as Your Father]</h3>
<p>— Xue Ying</p>
<p>The word [big] was originally used to distinguish the size, seniority, and status of things. For example, Mount Tai, Kunlun, and hair, fine sand. Parents and juniors; superiors and subordinates.</p>
<p>Now it's really laughable! Even those who are common, like lawyers and doctors, as long as you cross the busy road, you can see signs of [XX Great Law Firm] everywhere!</p>
<p>A small inn with a few rooms also writes the words [XX Grand Hotel]. Shanghai's "big" is truly without limit! [XX Grand Theater], [XX Grand Stage]. Perhaps this is because people living in Shanghai love [big]? Look, how big the [Official Sauce Garden] of the oil and sauce industry and the [Pawnshop] of the pawnshop industry are written!</p>
<p>Further, you can see the swaggering navies of various countries in the concession. On their cap badges, the words [Great XX Empire Navy] are also engraved. [Great XX Empire], hum! This is really, I am not a geographer, I cannot use accurate measurements to say, but compared to our China, it is indeed only a few percent? Ha ha! This is what is called big, big, big!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast Army</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Bitterness Fills the Heart and Blessings are Given; Hasty Military Affairs Secretly Shift Troops</p>
<p>The reason for this is very clear, because the person who is the brigade commander can always read the newspaper. If he can't read the newspaper, he can get some news about the current situation on the social scene. The order cannot be very vague. As for the regimental commander dealing with the battalion commander, in terms of status, there is no need to be very polite, so he only tells him to move camp and quickly make a form. The regimental commander can naturally guess a bit about where to move camp, but he cannot tell the battalion commander what he guessed. Therefore, when this order reaches the battalion commander, only one or two tenths of the original meaning remains. The battalion commander can't be that honest either and completely tell the company commander the order he received. What he knows more specifically is that he will move camp within a few days. At least, he should retain this point. Therefore, what he tells the company commander is to quickly make a form of the number of people, horses, equipment, and weapons in his company. Simply put, he doesn't even mention the words "move camp." That day, Zhao Ziqiang received the order from the battalion headquarters to quickly make a form. This is a sign before the troops set off. Once this kind of thing happens, they will definitely set off. In normal times, it doesn't matter if the army moves from east to west or from west to east. Judging from the current situation, it must be fighting with the Japanese army. What is there to be afraid of in fighting? Isn't that what soldiers are here for? If you are afraid of fighting, you shouldn't have joined the army in the first place. There is only one thing: he is a person who has just gotten engaged, and he is hoping to live that happy family life, but he didn't expect to have even a taste of being a fiancé, and now he has to leave Haidian, which is really disappointing. As for himself, whether he is disappointed or not, it doesn't matter much. The most unbearable thing is telling this to Guizhi. How uncomfortable will Guizhi be! She was originally not very willing to marry a soldier, because soldiers are always not at home. With great difficulty, he got her to change her mind. As soon as they get engaged, he has to leave. Isn't this clearly telling people that soldiers should never be married? (206)</p>
<p>The desolate grave mountains, trees, and vines are everywhere. Zhongshan Road lies stiffly like a dead snake. Horse manure and mud are like the patterns on a snake's body. A car sped past, and dust flew all over the sky, blurring the sky. The eyes of the thatched huts and pedestrians by the roadside.</p>
<p>In the early morning, just as the sun showed his face, the clatter of horses' hooves galloped on this road. Yellow and white riding breeches, ribbons fluttering behind the neck, shiny long boots, high-rolled sleeves, triumphant faces. Foreign youths, Chinese college students. Male, female, two horses galloping together, tightly. The happiness of the world is taken by them, and envious eyes are all focused on them.</p>
<p>In the evening, groups of female workers, carrying food baskets, slowly and tiredly stepped on the road full of horse manure and mud to go home. A car sped from behind, and two large electric lights shone brightly in the hazy darkness, like the eyes of a pair of fierce beasts. Fluttering ribbons, fluffy beautiful hair, a flash, and it was a joyride.</p>
<p>One or two foreign men and women, bathed in the vast night, walked lazily. Is it coming back from a game of high and rich... my friend said that's why it's called [referring to one's father as your father].</p>
<p>I said why not just call it [Night Man's Conceit]?</p>
<p>We couldn't help but laugh at each other.</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>A Newly Emerging Crop</h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>The cry for rural economic bankruptcy has been deafening, but merely making noise without planning for the aftermath will inevitably lead to an incurable situation. What is the solution for the aftermath? In addition to studying the question of social distribution or improving seeds and farm implements, one must pay attention to newly emerging crops. Pyrethrum originates from Dalmatia in Austria. In 1506, it was discovered to have special effects in killing insects and was valued by various countries. The main production areas are now concentrated in Japan, and the export value reaches tens of millions of yuan annually. However, in our country, it is still considered a newly emerging crop, and people have only recently begun to pay attention to planting it. For example, the Family Industrial Society, because the main raw material used to manufacture mosquito coils is pyrethrum powder, and also feeling the lack of this domestic raw material, is cooperating with the Shanghai Bank Agricultural Cooperative Loan Department to provide seeds without charge, and the Shanghai Bank is entrusting various rural cooperatives to plant them. However, the national factories need a lot, and unless planting is actively promoted, it is still feared that we will have to rely on foreign countries. Therefore, based on what I know, I will briefly list the following for the reference of agricultural workers.</p>
<p>(1) Efficacy: Pyrethrum contains a non-volatile acid that can kill ants, bedbugs, lice, grasshoppers, beetles, weevils, leaf rollers, leafhoppers, and other pests. For example: (1) Mix eight parts of wood ash with one part of pyrethrum and seal tightly for one day and night. Sprinkle it on the stems and leaves of plants, and the pests will be killed. (2) Mix one part of pyrethrum with two parts of wheat flour to kill pests in furniture and in the feathers of poultry and livestock. (3) Add five taels of pyrethrum powder to one liter each of clear water and alcohol. Soak for one day and night. When using, mix one part of this mixture with ten parts of clear water to kill all beetles. (4) Combine seventy-five pounds of pyrethrum with twenty-five pounds of elm flour to make mosquito repellent incense.</p>
<p>(2) Types: Pyrethrum is a plant of the chrysanthemum family and has two types, red and white. The red one originates from the mountains of Caucasus and Persia, but its insecticidal effect is very small and is only used for ornamental purposes. The white one is the one mentioned earlier that originates from Dalmatia in Austria. It has strong properties, abundant yield, and great insecticidal effect.</p>
<p>(3) Sowing: There are two sowing periods, spring and autumn. The spring period is between February and March of the lunar calendar; the autumn period is between July and August. Before sowing, a seedbed should be prepared, with a layer of loose and fine soil about three or four inches thick. A layer of sifted topsoil should be spread on top of the soil and watered with rotten human manure or urine. After four or five days, seeding can begin. However, after the seeds are sown, they still need to be covered with fine soil, lightly pressed with a board, and covered with rice straw. After germination, remove the rice straw and be sure to prepare a shade to prevent strong sunlight and strong winds and rain. When the seedlings are about two inches tall, they need to be transplanted once, with each branch spaced about three inches apart. This is called temporary planting. The period for fixed planting is usually in September for spring sowing and in April of the following year for autumn sowing. Pyrethrum has a long life span, but at a certain stage, root division can be used to extend its life without the need for separate sowing.</p>
<p>(4) Land and Fertilizer: The land for growing pyrethrum is most afraid of poorly drained low-lying areas. If too much light fertilizer is used, it will only nourish the leaves and not produce flower buds, which is equivalent to no harvest, because the insecticidal oxygen in pyrethrum is most abundant in the flowers, and mosquito coils are entirely made of pollen.</p>
<p>(5) Value: Each mu of land can yield at least more than sixty catties of dried flowers, and up to one hundred and twenty catties, worth fifty or sixty yuan to eighty or ninety yuan. Compared with the profits obtained from other crops, it is truly beyond measure. Moreover, mountain slopes, river terraces, wasteland, sandy land, etc. are not worth much, but if they are used to grow pyrethrum, they are extremely suitable. Why not do it?</p>
<p>What I have written above is mostly from references in various books, and especially from Mr. Zhu Songxi's [Experimental Cultivation of Pyrethrum], as he is an experimenter in planting pyrethrum, and his words should be more reliable. As for the detailed situation, I hope that agricultural experts will contribute their experimental results to society at any time.

<p>Financial Gold Price Rises Again by Twelve Dollars</p>
<p>Breaking Through the 790 Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>The gold market has been robust for consecutive days, rising again yesterday and breaking through the major 790 yuan barrier. Market sentiment is extremely positive, with active short covering. The situation within the market is initially stable but later becomes lively, mainly due to tight interbank positions. At the beginning of the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US remained unchanged, and although the UK rose, it was minimal. US, UK, and French silver prices all fell sharply. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell by varying amounts of 5.5 and 4.5 percent. London spot gold rose by 2.5 pence, and US new mine gold rose by $0.17, totaling $31.72. US wheat fell by 3.875 points. Stocks fell slightly. US cotton saw a minor increase of one pound. The opening price for wool was immediately raised to $86.7, and then, due to vigorous buying by Dah Sing Wing, Yuan Mao, Gan Cheung Cheung, and others, it nearly exceeded $90. After the opening, banks uniformly tightened their positions. The HSBC exchange rate remained flat for British currency but depreciated by 0.25 for US currency. The situation did not reveal strong bullishness but rather fluctuated. There was not much rise or fall, and the trend was relatively stable. Afterwards, silver companies and others aggressively bought US dollars, causing the exchange market to gradually tighten, which boosted the gold price. There were rumors of a sharp fall in US wheat, but it had little impact, as the gold market was inherently trending higher. Prices rose further after the market closed, with demand exceeding supply in the afternoon, and the trend was extremely good. The swap rate was 1135 yuan. The market situation for the afternoon is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 789.5 yuan, an increase of 7.8 yuan compared to the previous closing. Goods opened at 9.2 yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with near-term British exchange rates at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 375 points, and the US exchange rate at 30.375 yuan. Although Wing Fung and Heng Hing entered the market, HSBC, McCallum, and Banque de l'Indochine tightened their positions. US dollars for January were priced at 9375. Chi Fung Wing, Fook Yue, and Man Hing were all selling. The market was not stable, and it retreated to 7.5 yuan because US dollars for January could be settled at 9375. HSBC's exchange rate was flat for British currency but depreciated by 0.25 for US currency. At the time of announcement, the price hovered around 8 yuan. Hang Tai, Cheung Sing Wing, Hang Yue, Gan Cheung Cheung, Yuan Chun, and others jointly submitted orders. Mitsui bought US dollars for November at 5625, which rose to 90.05 yuan. HSBC again tightened its US dollar position for January at 9375. Yuan Mao Wing and Yuan Shing Wing sold off, retreating to within 79 yuan. Banque de l'Indochine also released 9375 for January. Yuan Chun, Yam Fat Wing, Tung Hing, and Wing sold again, retreating to 8 yuan. Heng Hing submitted orders and stabilized. Silver companies were still actively buying settlements. The internal market for US dollars gradually tightened. Chi Fung Wing Fook Yue, Hang Yue, and King Fat Wing, among others, advanced again to over 90 yuan, with US dollars for January at 8125. Banks were unwilling to supply. Yuan Mao Wing, Hang Yue, and Shiu Fung Cheung made efforts and the price rose to 93.8 yuan, greatly boosting market sentiment. After struggling for a while, the market closed at 793.7 yuan, an increase of 12 yuan compared to the previous closing. After the market closed, Goods, Hang Yue, Yuan Shing Wing, Chui Tai, and others submitted orders one after another, rising to around 6 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 5 yuan. The highest price during the half-day was 793.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 787.5 yuan, a difference of 6.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The announced price was based on HSBC's US dollar exchange rate depreciating by 0.25, resulting in 30 yuan, equivalent to a standard gold price of 800 yuan. Based on the closing price, this implies a discount of about 6 yuan, which is more than 5 yuan less than the previous closing. The registered price for this month is 802 yuan, and for November, it is 794 yuan. The water replenishment price in the morning was 802 yuan. The swap rate was 1135 yuan.

<h3>Jiangnan Small Coins Rise Slightly, Copper Coins Frequently Depreciate</h3>
<p>丨Approaching the 300,000 Cash Mark丨</p>

The transaction volume was 6,000 jiao in the morning and 4,500 jiao in the afternoon.

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Chaotic and Deformed</h3>
<p>Although Many Bearish Speculators... Ultimately, Boosted by the Financial Sector</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw no change in the bond environment. Financial constraints are an undeniable fact. However, short sellers suddenly covered their positions, and the financial sector bought in, so the market initially seemed to be on the verge of collapse, but was ultimately lifted and raised by the buying households. The opening and closing of the morning were extremely chaotic. Northern merchants sold quite a bit, but there was a unique demand for No. 31. In the first round, eight types had no rise or fall, three types fell by 5 points, and the rest rose by 5 points to 1.5 jiao. In the second round, eight types had no transactions, four types rose by 5 points to 1 jiao, and the rest fell by 5 points to 1.5 jiao. The market was chaotic and deformed. If it were not for No. 31 buying in, the market price would have been low. The situation in the afternoon was completely different. At the opening, the appetite of No. 31 was not yet satisfied, but Nos. 11 and 13 both had demand. Although Northern merchants and retail investors supplied, it was not enough to meet demand, so it turned to rise by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. No. 20 was the most peculiar. In October, it was completely bought in by No. 11, and in November, it was almost completely sold out by No. 16. At the closing, No. 23 absorbed. The forward consolidated tax was raised by 3 jiao, and the rest also continued to improve by 1-2 jiao. Therefore, the market price ultimately rose by 5 points to 4 jiao, mainly because there were many who were bearish recently, and the short positions were crowded, making it difficult to recover in the short term. The total transaction volume was 5,948,500 yuan, including 8,500 yuan in spot goods. The futures consolidated salt tax totaled 2.33 million, demobilization bonds 865,000, 19th Customs bonds 455,000, 20th Customs bonds 1.58 million, and the rest only ranged from 12,000 to 1-200,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Initially Firm, Then Weak</h3>
<p>New Fung Foreign Firm reports that on the 6th, the New York stock market initially advanced due to good commercial news. Subsequently, due to an unexpected sharp fall in food prices, the market also declined. Goods remained relatively stable. The total daily trading volume was $1,460,000. [Wheat] The government's declaration that there will be a stable monetary policy may cause the market to rebound. It is now eagerly awaiting its implementation. [Cotton] There was a large-scale liquidation in the South. The continued conclusion of long positions disappointed those who advocated currency inflation. Speculators are waiting for the government's cotton loan details and the government's cotton production report. There is little buying. Currently, only manufacturers are buying in, which is insufficient to absorb the large-scale liquidation. The amount of manufacturer purchases this week is considerable. [Silver] The market is loose due to speculator selling. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market in a Flat and Weak Process</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains weak. Because US cotton continues to fall, market sentiment is disheartened and buying is flat. However, raw cotton is firmly rising, which supports the yarn market. Currently, yarn sales can still be maintained. However, both long and short positions have considerable strength, making future changes difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Human Mark Initially Falls in the Morning, Recovers in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Human Mark opened flat in the morning. When auctions reached the second and third round, there were not many buyers in the market, and the market fell. Prices for each month fell by 4, 5, 6, and 9 jiao. In the afternoon, short sellers covered their profits, and prices recovered by 2 and 4 jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 25,000 bales.

<h3>Cotton Slightly Declines, Market Sentiment Still High</h3>
<p>Rainy Weather Damages Cotton Bolls... Bullish Sentiment Remains Strong</p>
<p>The cotton market declined slightly, and the situation is still strong, but although US cotton fell and the gold price rose again, the weather is bad, with drizzle and drizzle, and the cotton bolls are seriously damaged, and there is a risk of rot, so some longs are not releasing. Various sources are also affected by the weather, so the cotton market is higher than the yarn market.</p>
<h3>Zheng Mark Only Falls Slightly</h3>
<p>The Zheng Mark opened in the morning market and fell slightly by 5 points to 1 jiao following the slight decline in foreign cotton.

<h3>US Cotton's Sell-off Impacts Market Performance Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was extremely weak due to large-scale sell-offs, reactionary selling, and a weak Wall Street. As a result, spot prices fell by 20 pounds, and futures prices fell by 21 to 29 pounds. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot prices fall by 5 points and futures prices fall by 67 points. In the Egyptian cotton market, spot prices fell by 6 points. In the Bombay cotton market, European exporters bought in, but were offset by speculator selling.

<p>New York, 6th: The Cotton Inspection Office estimates this year's new cotton production to be 64.1% of the normal annual production, totaling 12,526,000 bales, an increase of 14,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (September 6th).</p>
<h3>US Cotton Unstable Last Week Due to Loan Restrictions</h3>
<p>A New York telegram on October 6th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, stating that raw cotton trading this week was restricted because people in the market were awaiting details of the cotton loan program and the government's next cotton production report (the next report will be released on October 9th). Cotton from the fields is now being shipped out. Before this loan of one cent per pound is in hand, farmers who urgently need cash are gradually selling their cotton at the current price. As a result, there are more and more liquidations. Those who sell at low prices are absorbed by purchases from peers and short covering. There have been repeated reports of a growing hoarding movement, and many believe that this movement will be even more pronounced when government loans become available. It is rumored that cotton farmers in the Southwest are currently hoarding 30% to 60% of their cotton. At the same time, general attention is focused on the general commercial and monetary situation, as well as the impact of loan programs and the sales policy in the South. Next year's cotton planting control plan should enable people to firmly believe in the ultimate value of cotton.</p>
<h3>Grain: Newly Harvested Glutinous Rice Floods the Market, Prices Fall by More Than One Jiao</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Sources number over forty, mostly new goods. Due to rain, the appetite of shops on this street suddenly turned sluggish. The market for various grades of new glutinous rice and new early rice suddenly became soft. Although sellers tried hard to pull up prices, the outgoing route was limited. Prices for various grades of new glutinous rice fell by 1-2 jiao. New early rice was adjusted by several points to nearly one jiao. Broken glutinous rice and thinly milled rice remained firm due to scarcity. New Yin Yuan still showed a bullish color. Ordinary glutinous rice and varied Yuan remained missing from the market. As for bulk orders from out-of-town merchants, it is said that due to the prices in other places, it is difficult to make a profit, so they continue to suspend operations. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, over forty sources from various routes downstream of the river. In the morning, due to rain, the outgoing route for various goods on the market was normal. The market for white broken glutinous rice and sub-standard varied Yuan was slightly tighter. The prices for West new glutinous rice and new Du pointed rice were slightly lower by several points. Prices for new and aged Yang pointed rice, new Bu pointed rice, new and aged passenger pointed rice, thinly husked rice, new Yin Yuan, special varieties, hundred fruit, and East new glutinous rice were stable.</p>
<h3>Passenger Xian Rice Sells Actively, Price Rises One Jiao</h3>
<p>▲Source Decrease After Production Price Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for passenger Xian rice saw Xiang rice shipped directly to Lianyingzhou. The production price was reported to have risen. The freight rate has increased greatly. Subsequent shipments are difficult to transport. All goods in transit have arrived. There will be no more arrivals after that. There are also few sources from Nanjing, because Wan rice is exported from Wuhu to Chaozhou and Shantou, and the production prices in both places have risen, ranging from 7-8 jiao to one yuan. Since the price in Shanghai has been bullish since the previous week, the market has stabilized and is no longer rising, so traders are watching. Yesterday, the Min province Fuzhou and Quanzhou reopened for business, and the Shantou trade inquired again. There is a shortage of goods and sales are active. The price rose one jiao. Throughout the day, the Shantou trade purchased over 700 bags of Nanjing Ji Xian rice, 500 bags of Hunan rough Jing rice, the Min province trade purchased 1,250 bags of Hunan Ji rice, 550 bags of rice, over 1,000 bags of brown rice, and 600 bags of Tin Xian. The market prices have each risen by about one jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Reopened as Usual Yesterday</h3>
<p>丨Initial Sharp Fall... Followed by Recovery</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market did not open in the morning due to unresolved guarantee issues. In the afternoon, as most had paid, it reopened as usual. However, the market sentiment was still pessimistic at the initial opening, because the price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell again by $1.20, Canada fell by $0.40, and the sharp fall of wheat auctions made people feel uneasy. Therefore, the opening price for this month fell sharply again, and new records were seen. The lowest was $2.1125. Forward prices also fell by 1-2 points. However, the step saw a recovery because the Tianjin trade had a slight appetite. Artillery convoys pulled in 30,000 to 50,000 bags, delivered directly to Tianjin, with 8 points added to the standard price. Forward prices stabilized because large and small factories uniformly suspended operations, so the market situation gradually stabilized. Looking ahead, it may be calm for the time being, and then look at the situation abroad for rise and fall. As a result, this month fell by 1 point, November was unchanged, December and January fell by 0.05, February rose by 0.025, and March fell by 0.025. Furthermore, the exchange announced that from yesterday, the seller's guarantee deposit was increased to 500 yuan per thousand bags, and the buyer's remained the same.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Initially Falls, Then Recovers</h3>
<p>▲Spot Goods Slightly Loose... Opening at 6,300 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of futures wheat in the morning, prices for all months again showed a consistent weak state. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago continued to fall by $1.20, Canada fell by $0.40, and the continuous sale of foreign wheat made people feel even more uneasy. Therefore, after the opening price, prices for all months fell by 2-3 points compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, it was initially flat. Then, because the flour market had opened and prices had also recovered, the market slightly improved, and outside shorts also began to cover their positions, resulting in a slightly more lively opening. However, the sale of foreign wheat has not ended, and the future is still worrying. As a result, this month fell by 0.02, November was unchanged, December rose by 0.01, January was unchanged, and February and March each rose by 0.01. The spot wheat market has active trading, but prices are gradually loosening. Sub-standard goods fell by 5 points to 1 jiao. Kaihu hot wheat was $3.58, Zhenjiang wheat was $3.57, Gaoyou wheat was $3.77, and sub-standard was $0.58. Sprouted wheat was $3.72, Yangzhou wheat was $3.66, Tong wheat was $3.70, sub-standard was $0.60, and Linhuai pass was $3.66, totaling 6,300 bags.</p>
<h3>Sesame Market Difficult to Advance</h3>
<p>Although the sesame market is gradually declining, it is still better than other grain markets, so its sources continue to connect. However, the owners are all eager to sell, making it difficult for the market to stand firm. Fortunately, the buying interest on this street is still strong, with only a few exports to decorate. Yesterday, the Ningbo trade purchased over 100 bags of Guan Dian sesame, with the price opening at $7.92. This street purchased a total of over 200 bags of Guan Dian sesame, priced at $7.45, and 62 bags of Yaowan sesame, priced at $6.15, 20 bags of Jiujiang sesame, priced at $5.90, 50 bags of Yangzhou sesame, also priced at $5.90, and 50 bags of Danyang black sesame, sold at $6.00. The Shao trade has been watching for many days because the goods prices do not match.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Newly Sun-Dried Meat Opens at High Prices</h3>
<p>Newly sun-dried round meat has become scarce recently, and land prices have repeatedly risen, so the market situation is quite tight. Yesterday, newly sun-dried meat from the docks opened at around $103, and sun-dried meat from Xiamen opened at $75. However, the old goods are quite different due to their poor color, making it difficult to get a good price. The shops are still holding on, waiting for an opportunity.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined and Coarse Sugar Prices Tighten with Customs Gold Unit Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw prices tighten again as the Customs Gold Unit rose. The Sugar Association's benchmark for common grade coarse white sugar rose to $21.65 per picul. The quoted prices for No. 20 medium white sugar and Dutch brown sugar remained the same as yesterday. However, due to the weekend, there were no shipments, resulting in a lack of transactions. Taikoo sugar B mark rose 5 cents to $21.70, DY mark was at $21.25, with some transactions. China Guohua cotton white top grade was at $20.80, No. 1 at $20.60, No. 2 at $20.40, No. 3 at $20.20, and No. 4 at $20.00. Zhen Ji No. 1 cotton was quoted at $20.65, but no transactions occurred. Guanghua Lu-character was quoted at $20.80. Negotiations for Chaoqing sugar failed, and no further offers were made.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Prices of Woolen Fabrics from Various Countries Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen fabric trade was very active, and the atmosphere in the association's market was quite good. Following the price increases from Deji &amp; Co., woolen fabrics from other countries also rose yesterday. Domestic goods also saw some price increases. This was due to rising wool prices abroad, increased pricing by foreign firms, and higher tariffs, which significantly increased the cost of woolen fabrics. Currently, goods from England and France have seen the most significant price increases, followed by goods from the United States, Germany, and other countries. Goods from Japan and China have seen relatively moderate price increases, with each yard rising by only 2.5 to 5 cents. The wholesale price for the top-grade, non-fading silk-finished rain-weave fabric made in China is 90 cents per yard, and the second-grade fabric is 85 cents.</p>
<h3>Metalware: Local Nail Factory Raises Price by One Dime</h3>
<p>The local nail factory has recently seen strong sales, but the supply of raw materials has been limited, causing panic in the market. Recently, sellers raised the price by one dime to moderate demand and restrict buyers. The price is now $7.20 per keg for common nails and $7.80 per keg for export goods. Despite continuous rain yesterday, it is reported that over 700 to 800 kegs were still sold. The strongest demand seems to be coming from Changjiang Road.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheet Market Faces Supply Interruption</h3>
<p>Tianjin merchants vigorously purchased 18-gauge black iron sheets yesterday, immediately improving the market sentiment. Although prices did not increase, the overall trend is significantly better than before. It is reported that a total of 1,400 to 1,500 piculs were offered on the market yesterday, with a price of $11.40 per picul.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Pessimism in European and American Silk Markets Increases</h3>
<p>(Overseas Spot Silk Prices Continue to Decline) This morning, firms such as American Zhuang Ganli and French Zhuang Xinfu received telegrams from overseas silk markets stating that the silk market is seeing continued price declines due to speculative selling by hoarders and sluggish factory sales. Spot silk in New York has fallen below $1.60 per pound. White filature silk in Lyon fell another two francs yesterday, with A-grade thrown silk priced at only $879 per bale in Chinese currency, a drop of over $20 from Monday. The outlook is increasingly pessimistic.</p>
<p>(Japanese Rayon Being Dumped at Reduced Prices) Recently, imports of Japanese rayon to Shanghai have been smooth. Japanese merchants are actively dumping goods at reduced prices. Recently, gangs such as the Changjiang Yanqing have purchased over 200 cases of Japanese rayon, such as Sakura and Bijin brands, in Shanghai at prices $40 to $50 cheaper than European and American rayon. Packaging and transportation to the destination are included in the price.</p>
<p>(Foreign Firms Face Difficulty Selling Silk) Overseas silk markets are deteriorating, with silk prices plummeting. Chinese silk merchants are reluctant to accept current prices when telegraphed. Chinese silk merchants have ample stocks and are receiving few inquiries. Yesterday, only Dachang and others purchased eleven bales of Huang Filature silk and ten bales of Huang Reeled silk, with prices continuing to weaken.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei and Pearl Tea Trade is Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, firms such as British Jardine Matheson, Dongfu, and Xiehe Dodd had a good appetite for Zhenmei pearl tea arriving from various origins. Needle and Xiu Mei teas also saw considerable transactions. The total volume of green tea traded throughout the city was over 1,300 boxes. Among them, bud-picked Zhenmei tea sold for $188, and ordinary working-grade teas sold for $127. Market prices were quite firm. However, the prices for Needle and Xiu Mei teas fell by another $4 to $5. Based on the current market situation, prices are expected to decline rather than rise.</p>

<h3>A Philistine's Self-Disturbance</h3>
<p>— Ou Bi</p>
<p>Life could have been peaceful, but those Chinese disturbed it, and now the world is full of trouble.</p>
<p>Is it wrong to praise the great British Empire? I praise mine, why do you have to interfere? And can you even interfere? Doesn't the flag of the British Empire still fly wherever the sun shines? You philistines!</p>
<p>The British Empire is undeniably worthy of praise, and you can't understand why people attack you for praising it. Maybe, perhaps, they are stateless vagrants, maybe they are lackeys of some other empire, maybe they are jealous and can't stand you, or maybe they are just self-disturbing philistines.</p>
<p>But, no matter what they are, you feel angry when you are attacked. You have to counterattack to feel better. So you search for the weaknesses of the person attacking you; when you find them, you prepare to kill him with a powerful arrow.</p>
<p>Finally, you find your arrow target, which you see as his weakness: he is from the three eastern provinces.</p>
<p>Then you can triumphantly say, "You from the three eastern provinces, don't you know who is oppressing you? Instead of going back to your country to revolt, you are helping others draw swords in this Republic of China? Do you want to be a Byron helping the Greek revolution?" You ask that to mock his shamelessness. If you were from the three eastern provinces, you would have gone back to revolt long ago, and wouldn't be making a fool of yourself in Shanghai. Yes, Shanghai, you believe Shanghai is completely part of the Republic of China, and won't be invaded by any other country, or else you would have revolted. And even if it were invaded by some other country, at most it would be the British Empire, which is no problem because you praise the British Empire.</p>
<p>And even if he is not from the three eastern provinces, he will always have a weakness for you to seize. For example, he might be suffering from an eye disease, and you can scold him, "You can't even take care of your own body, and you want to meddle in other people's business? Are you qualified?"</p>
<p>So your anger is vented, and at the same time, the flag of the British Empire continues to spread throughout the world with the sun's rays.</p>
<p>[The world is inherently peaceful, but philistines disturb it!] You exclaim with some understanding at the end.</p>
<h3>[Zhuangzi] and [Wen Xuan]</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhicun</p>
<p>Last month, the editor of the Dabao Evening News sent a postcard with a form, asking me to fill in two items: (1) What book am I currently reading? (2) What books would I recommend to young people?</p>
<p>In the second item, I wrote [Zhuangzi] and [Wen Xuan], and added a footnote: [To help with the literary cultivation of young people].</p>
<p>Today, after reading Mr. Feng Ziyu's [Reminiscences] in Free Talk, I couldn't help but feel a little paranoid, thinking that Mr. Feng's article was written for me.</p>
<p>But now I don't want to argue with Mr. Feng, I just want to take this opportunity to explain myself.</p>
<p>First, I should explain why I want young people to read [Zhuangzi] and [Wen Xuan]. In recent years, my life has shifted from being a Chinese teacher to editing a magazine, and I have had too many opportunities to come into contact with the writings of young people. I always feel that these young people's writings are too clumsy and straightforward, and their vocabulary is too small, so I recommended these two books in the narrow lines of the form sent by the Dabao Evening News editor. I thought that from these two books, one could gain some insight into writing methods, and at the same time expand one's vocabulary (although many of the words in them are dead). But of course, I don't want young people to write [ancient prose] like [Zhuangzi] and [Wen Xuan].</p>
<p>Second, I should explain that I only hope that young people who aspire to literature can read these two books. I believe that every writer must borrow from the literature of his predecessors. I don't understand what the dividing line between [new literature] and [old literature] is. In literature, I think the analogy of [new wine in old bottles] and [old wine in new bottles] is wrong. If we compare a person's literary cultivation to wine, then we can say that the age of the bottle doesn't matter, but the wine must be brewed.</p>
<p>I advise young literary people to read [Zhuangzi] and [Wen Xuan] in order to [brew]. If the form sent by the Dabao Evening News editor were wider, I would have liked to write down a few more books.</p>
<p>Here, we might as well take Mr. Lu Xun as an example. A new writer like Mr. Lu Xun seems to be a completely new bottle. But what about his wine? Pure brandy? I can't believe it. Without the cultivation of ancient literature, Mr. Lu Xun's new articles would never have been written so well. Therefore, I dare to say that in a bottle like Mr. Lu Xun's, there must be many ingredients of Wujiapi or Shaoxing rice wine.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Feng Ziyu thinking that writing seal script, filling in lyrics, and using envelopes with self-carved printing plates are all things that do not come from schools or national studies experts, I think this is also a bit arbitrary. These are actually just personal matters. If the person who writes seal script doesn't write letters in seal script, if the person who fills in lyrics doesn't use lyrics to recruit scholars when he becomes an official, if the person who uses self-carved printing plate envelopes doesn't force others to carve a special envelope, then there is no need for Mr. Feng to condemn them as [errors] and [monsters].</p>
<p>In the new literary world, there are also those who play with wood carving, study versions, collect bookplates, write prefaces to vernacular letters in parallel prose, and even display small ornaments on their desks. According to Mr. Feng's opinion, do they want [to establish themselves in the world with [modern elegance]]? I don't think they have that intention.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that Mr. Feng's article was not written for me.</p>
<h3>Luo Heizhi and Peng Jiahuan</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>I don't know Luo Heizhi and Peng Jiahuan, but they are both deceased modern Chinese writers, and their works belong to the scope of old realism, and their fates are very similar. Accidentally looking back at the Chinese literary scene in the past, I remembered the era full of sentimental atmosphere, and couldn't help but compare the two of them.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, it is really an intriguing thing. If you put Luo Heizhi's [Spring Day] and Peng Jiahuan's [Inducement] together, not only the form, but also the content is very similar. Luo Heizhi's works usually write about the most universal sorrow of life from an extremely ordinary little thing. His writing is gentle, but it contains bitterness. Although Peng Jiahuan's expression is also similar, he likes to talk nonsense, which distracts the reader's attention; he cannot be as short as Luo Heizhi, whose words are forcefully refined, and can grasp the reader's emotions from beginning to end.</p>
<p>However, what is noteworthy is not their works, but the similarity of their fates. Really, in the intellectual class, it is impossible to find another person like Luo Heizhi and Peng Jiahuan who seems to be cast from the same mold. Peng Jiahuan is from Hunan, and although Luo Heizhi is registered in Jiangxi, he grew up in Sichuan, but he married in Hunan and settled in Hunan, so he can also be considered a Hunanese. Luo Heizhi once taught, and Peng Jiahuan also taught. Luo Heizhi once entered the Hunan Library Compilation Bureau, and Peng Jiahuan also entered the Shanghai Commercial Press. Luo Heizhi was once imprisoned, and Peng Jiahuan was also imprisoned. Luo Heizhi's imprisonment was due to some suspicion, and Peng Jiahuan's imprisonment was also due to some suspicion. Luo Heizhi died of stomach disease, and Peng Jiahuan also died of stomach disease. Reading Du Fu's poem [Articles resent success, monsters like to pass by], I can't help but cry for these two writers with the same fate.</p>
<p>Luo Heizhi and Peng Jiahuan almost appeared in the literary world at the same time. However, Luo Heizhi died too quickly, leaving only [Drunk] and [Spring Day] two novels. His death can't help but remind people of the Japanese female writer Higuchi Ichiyo, and raise the feeling of [Why does it come so late and go so fast]. Peng Jiahuan's life was extended by six years compared to Luo Heizhi, so he left behind more novels.</p>
<p>In China, the times seem to pass especially quickly. Even in terms of literature, what others need a century or half a century to continue and replace, such as classicism, romanticism, and realism, we have all gone through them in more than ten years. Reading the posthumous works of Luo Heizhi and Peng Jiahuan can't help but evoke a kind of nostalgia and sentimental emotion.</p>
<h3>Ganpu Correspondence (1)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>Brother ○○,</p>
<p>You must be a little surprised that I, who have been living in the tense atmosphere of the city for a long time, suddenly ran to Ganpu, a seaside salt town with a completely opposite tone. But I finally came here. I am not like ordinary people, running to the seaside to change the tone of life. I want to take advantage of this accidental opportunity to understand the living conditions of the salt people living in the vast salt area. The car departed from Shanghai at 2:00 p.m., crossed the river in Minhang, passed through vast fields, and sped forward along the seawall. At 5:00 p.m., it completed this 127-kilometer journey and arrived at Ganpu City Station. When the car passed the Huangshan Seaside Bathing Beach, turned around the last mountain bay, and saw the image of the bell tower carrying a 5,000-jin ancient clock, we couldn't help but happily shout, Ganpu is here!</p>
<p>This is the second time to Ganpu, and the second time to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway; the first time I came, I felt that the road was very flat, but this time, it was really unbearable. At first, I was very suspicious, why did the road get so bad in just a few months? Later, I understood; because in the newspapers, I haven't seen the so-called great figures passing through this road in recent months. The main purpose of building roads is to facilitate transportation, but now it is the opposite, only for military convenience and for the galloping of important people. We small people are just benefiting from it. In this way, even if we are bumped for a few hours, what can we say?</p>
<p>Along the way, we passed many towns, and Zhapu is the most important, because there is a seaside bathing beach here. From time to time, rich people take their beloved wives and concubines to bathe, dignitaries come here to view the mountains and seas, and foreigners with Shanghai minds come here for suburban excursions. Here, there is a bustling market, there is a public telephone bureau, a public bus station, a private car company, a fort, and a bathing beach. For the convenience of merchants and literati, many necessities are readily available. Rural women in Ganpu have not cut their hair, but in Zhapu, which is less than a hundred miles away, most of them have cut their hair and trimmed it very neatly. This good influence also comes from those tourists. However, the people are ultimately suffering, because prices are raised due to the demands of tourists, and are not much different from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Because I had made preparations early, I had no worries about accommodation in Ganpu. After getting off the bus, I passed through the T-shaped street near the station and walked into the ancient city, which was very famous in history but is now in ruins. If you are an elegant person, you will feel that the scenery is beautiful when you come here. Standing on the stone bridge at the city gate (I think this was a drawbridge in the past), looking along the moat all the way, there are mountains and water, trees and fields, as well as simple farmers, huge cattle, geese and ducks with a gentleman's style, and light boats that do not strike, which are very suitable for placement in the scenery, making you infinitely happy. It is quite a pity that I am not a person in [Xiaolin Guangji], otherwise, after seeing this picturesque scene, I would also make a poem about the city wall of this area, such as [One tooth, one tooth, and another tooth, five teeth, six teeth, seven or eight teeth]. However, it cannot be considered a pity after all, because far away in front is Xiashi, where the remains of our noble poet Xu Zhimo lie. Thinking of him climbing the mountain and whistling in the moonlight night, seeing the city teeth here, he will definitely come up with another poem. [Autumn scenery ghost chanting poetry], this has been the case since ancient times, how can Mr. Zhimo be an exception? Haha!</p>
<p>A Ying. August 13th night.</p>
<h3>A Page of Love</h3>
<p>— Written by Philippe of France, translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>One fifteen had passed. Henri Dayrolles had finished lunch at his parents' house and was walking to the office. He walked slowly. People are not in a hurry when going to work. He knew that work would always wait for him, no matter when. As he walked past Mr. Richard's house, the maid Mary happened to be looking out onto the street from the kitchen window. She was all alone. Mrs. Richard had taken the children to visit relatives in the countryside and wouldn't be back for four or five days. Mr. Richard had been invited to have lunch at Pastor Foiral's house. In such a big house, she was the only one guarding it.</p>
<p>Of course, if she had more lively eyes, Henri Dayrolles would have liked her even more. She had big blue eyes, but they felt empty in the middle because they were too big. But she had very beautiful red cheeks, so beautiful that one couldn't believe they were cheeks. He thought that if a man bit her cheek, his mouth would feel a nourishing warmth and sweet juice flowing in. It was because women had such brightly colored cheeks that men thought about women. Saying that kissing women was nonsense, women were edible. She was very tall and fleshy. Her big body was good, because if he were to eat, he would definitely choose this kind of woman to eat.</p>
<p>Henri Dayrolles felt his mouth watering. He hadn't realized that he had such a big appetite. He felt that he had the strength to swallow this girl. Therefore, he not only felt the joy of looking at this girl, but also felt the pleasure of biting this lovely thing with his steel-like teeth. The girl's lips especially caught his attention. Her lips were very delicate, and the flesh seemed to be tightly contracted there. He thought that if he were to eat, he should start from this place.</p>
<p>His courage was so great that he was inexplicably surprised. He knew that she was the only one in the kitchen, so he walked in without hesitation. He felt that his upper body had completely disappeared, leaving only a big mouth in his head. He thought that he would fill his newly made big mouth from now on.</p>
<p>Women are different animals from men. She allowed him to come in. When he walked towards her, she was a little surprised. She watched him walk over from afar, but as he got closer, she felt particularly calm, as if nothing had happened. She was in the kitchen alone, as if she were on a busy street. She said something irrelevant.</p>
<p>You see, our kitchen is so big! (To be continued)</p>

<p>Amateur Ramblings</p>
<h3>On Modernity</h3>
<p>— Liu Bingyi</p>
<p>Nowadays, many young men and women like to talk about [modernity]. Whether it's clothing or hairstyles, they have to pay attention to [modernity]. Most elderly people can't help but sigh and say, [Modernity is enough to destroy a country.] In fact, when you think about it carefully, [modernity] is not a bad thing. If a nation or a country wants to struggle out of the whirlpool of decline and old age, it must greatly promote [modernity]. [Modernity] is not only not enough to destroy a country, but it can also save a country.</p>
<p>Why is [modernity] enough to save a country? Here we should first understand the meaning of the two words [modernity]. The two words [modernity] are transliterated from the English word Modern. The meaning of this word is: [modern] [contemporary], which contains a kind of [new] meaning. We know that human civilization, whether material or spiritual, [modern] is always better than [non-modern], and [new] is always better than [old]. This is because human civilization is progressing every day. It is only a shame that the Chinese nation is not growing and is lagging behind in everything. Therefore, the Chinese were often called [the old empire] by Westerners in the past; even today in the 1930s, the Chinese are still ridiculed by Japanese imperialism as [not worthy of being called a modern country]. They naturally feel hateful about the deliberate insult of Japanese imperialism. But we must also turn around and think: in China's current situation of military separatism, corrupt officials and corrupt politics, swindling society, and superstition in ghosts and gods, is there really anything that deserves to be called [a modern country]? If the Chinese nation really does not want to decline like this for a long time, and if it is really determined to create a modern civilized country, shouldn't it greatly promote [modernity]?</p>
<p>Promoting [modernity] is the first way to revitalize the country and encourage good customs. Chinese sages and philosophers advocated it thousands of years ago. The first chapter of the Great Learning says [The way of the Great Learning lies in manifesting bright virtue, in loving the people...], the word [loving] should be read as [new] according to Cheng Zi and Zhu Xi's interpretation, which shows that the sages also wanted to teach people [modernity]. Also, the inscription on Tang's plate says: [If you can renovate yourself for one day, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation.], which shows that the sages paid attention to [modernity] with all their strength. Others such as the Analects Jishi chapter: [The Zhou Dynasty looked at the two dynasties], how rich and splendid its culture was; I follow Zhou. The Zhou Dynasty culture was more [modern] than the Xia and Shang dynasties at that time. Confucius followed Zhou and not Xia and Shang, which shows that Confucius was also a person who advocated [modernity]. We Chinese have a bit of respect for the ancient temperament, and we want to respect the ancient and worship the sages in everything. I remember sixty or seventy years ago, some people learned from the West and advocated [freedom] and [equality]. The Chinese scholar-official class desperately supported [loyalty to the monarch] and [observing chastity]. The West and Japan advocated science and hygiene, and the Chinese scholar-official class shamelessly said: [Small feet are the spiritual civilization of China.] Now these old people oppose young men and women advocating [modernity]. I am afraid that they may still contain a bit of the stench of respecting the ancient and valuing the sages. Therefore, I do not hesitate to quote classics to make them know that the ancient sages also advocated [modernity]!</p>
<p>However, I still have some doubts... Is the [modernity] advocated by the general youth really [thorough], genuine [modernity]? Or is it a [false modernity] of [selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's head]? If the [modernity] advocated by these young men and women is only [modernity] in terms of clothes and hair, and in terms of thinking and behavior, they are still [birds of a feather] with those laggards; that is just a kind of [counterfeit brand of false modernity]. Not only can it not save the country, but it can't even save itself. Because the modern era is a world of scientific competition, the young people who conform to [modernity] should have the view of seeking welfare for the society and fulfilling responsibilities for mankind in terms of thinking; in terms of physical strength, they should have the spirit of courage and fierceness, and no retreat; in terms of knowledge and skills, they should have pure and proficient skills that are enough to support themselves and benefit the society. If they can't, and only pay attention to [modernity] in clothing and use, and the thoughts remaining in their minds are still the thoughts of becoming officials and getting rich; what is performed in terms of physical strength is still a weak scholar who can't tie a chicken; the knowledge and skills they possess are still a two-legged bookcase that doesn't know the difference between beans and wheat, and echoes what others say: then it can't be regarded as [true modernity], it can only be regarded as [selling dog meat under the guise of sheep's head] [stomach brand modernity]. It doesn't matter if you are cursed by others, it's just harming your own life!</p>
<p>A small social model</p>
<h3>Rage, China! By Gang Jian</h3>
<p>— Submitted by Mr. Nai Han, a Frenchman</p>
<p>A "Cantine" is a factory-established lodging and meal hall for lower-class workers. Their wages are too meager to afford hotels, so they have no choice but to live there. What I am about to write about is the "Cantine" of the Montluçon porcelain factory.</p>
<p>Montluçon is south of Paris, about two hours by train.</p>
<p>There are over a dozen Chinese workers laboring there, some of whom participated in the European War and are now stranded there, unwilling to return home. The rest are illegal immigrants from Qingtian, Zhejiang. Their wages are roughly 2.75 to over 3 francs per hour. The work they do is mostly firing kilns, grinding the surfaces of plates -- before a plate is glazed, they grind away the unevenness caused by small gravel in the clay to make it smooth for glazing, and they sort out plates with black spots or distorted shapes for sale as inferior goods. Occasionally, one or two people are engaged in the manufacture of cups and plates, but it is not easy for Chinese workers to get into these departments.</p>
<p>Each "Cantine" room houses six or seven people, sleeping on beds made of wooden planks. Straw mattresses and two tattered, smelly cotton blankets!</p>
<p>At six o'clock every morning, the "Cantine" manager opens all the room doors, ringing his bell. It seems he is shouting: [Get up, it's time for work!] The Chinese workers quickly jump out of bed from under the smelly blankets, indicating: [Bedbugs, I've fattened you up all night, and I have to go and make some nourishing blood for you.] So the bedbugs go into their comfortable nests, resting, resting, digesting the blood they sucked from the people.</p>
<h3>Self-Employment Introduction Replies</h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Ang: We have a position available for a staff member. If you are willing to consider it, please come to No. 104, Yongan Lane, North Sichuan Road, to discuss with me. (From Cheng Yuting)</p>
<p>Ms. Kang: I have something to ask of you. Please come to Helu, No. 19, Shide Lane, west of the Xinqiao near the sampan factory on Maigen Road, for a meeting. (From Lin He)</p>
<p>The clamor of voices, the wisps of smoke, filled the three-meter square room. Everyone took a towel and went to the tap to wash their faces. Many of them couldn't even afford a toothbrush, so they saved time and didn't even need to rinse!</p>
<p>Before people had finished washing their faces, the dining hall doors were already open. There, a bowl of unsweetened black coffee, steaming hot, awaited them, giving them a bit of excitement, so they could work well, lest those who hadn't had enough sleep would doze off.</p>
<p>After finishing the bowl of black coffee and two pieces of bread, people walked to the factory, turning their labor power into bread under the work, continuously creating the strength of labor. The poor live like this; no, they also have to take out a part to feed the bedbugs, otherwise, how can the bedbugs in this "Cantine" survive!</p>
<p>The factory bell rang, and the gate opened, men and women, old and young, crowded in. Each person went to their respective workplace, covering their clothes with rags, and drop by drop, beads of sweat fell down by the kiln!</p>
<p>The foreman, dressed in a white robe like a nurse, paced back and forth, stroking his mustache, and if he saw any workers not doing well, he would scold them a few times!</p>
<p>The workers then just whiled away the days.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, blood sausage and mashed potatoes awaited the people in the "Cantine." Also, there was a glass of inferior red wine with a bitter taste, which people drank with bitterness every day. Every day, at least nine and a half francs had to be spent, what else could you expect to eat!</p>
<p>Saturday was the happiest day for the workers, because it was payday. Before noon, the foreman gave each person a payslip, and then everyone lined up in front of the accounting office according to their number to collect the [price] of their labor.</p>
<p>After deducting the cost of the "Cantine," only a few dozen francs were left. Each person's clothes, shoes, socks, and pocket money all had to be figured out from that meager wage!</p>
<p>Interviews with Famous Figures in the Business World</p>
<h3>An Interview with Mr. Shen Jiucheng</h3>
<p>— By Jiang Shangyu</p>
<p>I -- what ordinary people call a [young master] -- always have to drink four bottles of milk and two courses of large dishes every day to nourish my body, so I have become a regular customer of Sheng Sheng Ranch. In fact, not to mention people like us who live in large mansions, even ordinary people, this inexpensive nutritious material is indispensable. Today, as I was about to open a bottle, I suddenly noticed a red "A" and thought of Mr. Shen Jiucheng of Sheng Sheng Ranch, a giant in the industrial world. So in the afternoon, I drove to visit him. When I arrived at Daxi Road, the magnificent Sheng Sheng Milk Company was already in sight, but at this time, a thought arose in my mind: [Will they not allow me to see him?] Later, I made up my mind, thinking that since I had come, there was no reason to return empty-handed, so I mustered up the courage to take out a card and asked someone to send it in. To my surprise, Mr. Shen actually came out to invite me in. Inside, Mr. Shen personally and very politely greeted me, and sincerely talked with me for a long time, even giving me a bottle of milk to drink. He told me his history in detail, saying that although he came from a well-to-do family, his ability to achieve what he has today is entirely due to hard work, self-improvement, frugality, diligence, and dedication to industrial work. In the first year of the Republic of China, he and his friends jointly founded the Sanyou Industrial Company, initially specializing in candle wicks, which gained the trust of foreign companies operating candle businesses, and the business flourished. Subsequently, various cotton textiles were issued, which were especially appreciated by people from all walks of life. However, in this era of scientific prosperity, everything changes with each passing day, so when he sees people who are superior or elder, he must try his best to emulate them, and if there is anything that is not perfect, he must try his best to improve it, and uphold a persevering spirit, unwavering, and strive for success. On weekdays, employees and workers are given ordinary and equal treatment to prevent them from being</p>

<p>seduced by others, which might cause pointless salary increase movements and class struggle. Fortunately, everyone can work together, year after year, so that a store with extremely small capital has jumped to an important position in the industrial world, and now has accumulated assets of several million.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen has been overworked over the years, which led to phlegm disease. According to the doctor, this is caused by malnutrition and must be cured by drinking fresh milk every day. At that time, he felt that most of China's milk industry was controlled by foreigners, and the outflow of rights and interests every year was huge, so after recovering from his illness, he immediately had the motivation to independently invest hundreds of thousands to establish the Sheng Sheng Ranch. Soon, the ranch was announced to be established. After several years of arduous operation, Mr. Shen dare not be conceited, but in terms of equipment, he has been recognized as satisfactory by the Health Bureau and the Engineering Bureau, and was awarded an "A" license. However, Mr. Shen's life goal is not to get rich, nor is it to gain this small reputation, so as to avoid the criticism of seeking fame, but to revitalize industry, rejuvenate the nation, serve society, and serve the country. Therefore, although Sheng Sheng is a sole proprietorship, it is by no means a private enterprise in nature, so the personnel it employs are not private individuals. No matter how displaced and down-and-out young people are, as long as they can work hard, endure hardship, and serve sincerely, our beloved Mr. Shen is happy to employ them according to their talents.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Shen also led me to visit various places, and saw that the internal equipment included steam engines, refrigeration machines, disinfection rooms, scientific cattle sheds, etc., all of which were explained in detail by Mr. Shen, either pointing out their names or describing their effects, making people who are in the place know the importance of science and hygiene. Seeing the internal organization, it is also very systematic, and the discipline is strict. Employees are not allowed to go out at ordinary times when there is nothing to do, which makes me nod and admire. From this, we can see that the reason why the ranch can achieve such results is all the crystallization of Mr. Shen's mind and effort. Otherwise, how could it reach this point?</p>

<h3>A Precursor to [Salary Bidding]</h3>
<p>— By Ms. Meng Yicheng</p>
<p>The threshold of the bank is not easy to cross. In the past, this job was only limited to people who had connections with a certain director or owner. Only young masters and young ladies were worthy of working in the bank. Ordinary people could only open their eyes wide outside the door, and they could not dream of crossing the threshold!</p>
<p>However, the fact is not so. Aren't the advertisements for the recruitment examinations of various banks published in the recent newspapers? These many open examinations are all about selecting talents based on [talent]. As long as you poor boy have studied hard and have some knowledge in your belly, you can be selected in the same way. After entering, there is food, there is housing, and there is a bonus at the end of the year. If you can be more attentive at work, you may gradually rise, and you will have a share in the position of staff member, director, or manager.</p>
<p>This can be regarded as the managers having a heart of compassion, hearing the cries of millions of unemployed people, and not hesitating to open the convenient door of the bank. This is really good news. Unemployed people, hurry up and [hang your head from the beam] [prick your thigh with an awl], and prepare for the examination day and night!</p>
<p>However, the qualifications for taking the examination for [probationary employee] require graduation from a domestic or foreign university with a major in commerce, and the qualifications for taking the examination for [trainee] require graduation from senior high school, which is a bit difficult for people -- especially poor boys who do not have the money to study. After being hired, the [probationary employee] is only given a subsidy of 30 yuan within three months, and the [trainee] is given a monthly subsidy of six yuan. According to people who have worked in the bank, the [staff member] only gets a salary increase once every two years, and the increase is only three or five yuan. The [trainee] has to practice for three years, which is almost like an apprentice. From this point of view, the life of a small staff member is like a bird in the hands of a bird seller. There is only a little millet to maintain a meager existence and will never become fat... After a long time, the wings will be numb, and even if it is released from the cage, it will not be able to fly high.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are a few people who have not forgotten the flapping of their wings and want to soar in the new open sky, unwilling to be bound by a prison for a little millet. However, this is the time for labor [auction]. Whose belly can not be hungry, there are so many unemployed people! The more people sell, the lower the [cost], and the more people buy, the more [bargaining]. As a result, advertisements for the recruitment of talents are published in newspapers, and banks hire [trainees] with a monthly salary of six yuan.</p>
<p>I am a little frightened, I am afraid that in the near future, the managers will ask for a [salary bidding] method!</p>

<h3>Learning Basic English Doesn't Quench Your Thirst</h3>
<p>— By Ke Riqing</p>
<p>—Written after reading Mr. Yu Renwei's [Learning Basic English Quenches Your Thirst]—</p>
<p>Basic English, consisting of 850 words, has been rejected by most linguists in various countries since it was announced by Cambridge University Professor Ogden, saying that it cannot be successful and cannot be made into an international language. In particular, the full mobilization of Esperanto scholars gave it (Basic English) the most powerful criticism.</p>
<p>At present, in China, not only are Esperantists fighting against it, but also English scholar Mr. Lin Yutang has raised his spear to participate. Free Talk, The Light of the World, New China, Reader's Digest, ... and other publications have been used as battlefields.</p>
<p>Those who advocate Basic English believe that the biggest shortcoming of English is that there are too many words, making it difficult for people to learn. Therefore, they have combined 850 commonly used words, thinking that this can solve the difficulty. In fact, this is the most foolish method, a method of turning back the clock. Because society is advancing day by day, and language is also evolving with society, therefore the writing language must increase and not decrease. Only by using scientific methods to reduce unnecessary word roots and increase the function of prefixes, suffixes, and grammar can a new word be formed, such as the Esperanto Patro (father) plus the suffix In (female) to form Patrino (mother), and then add a prefix bo to form Bopatrino (mother-in-law)... This is a scientific method of word reduction. Although Basic English also adopts prefixes and suffixes such as un'ing'ed, etc., this is only limited to a very small number. Therefore, there is Fafher (father), Mother (mother), and Motherinlaw (mother-in-law) with</p>
<p>different distinctions.</p>
<p>Pronunciation and stress are recognized difficulties in English. Basic English has not changed these places at all, it is still the same, it is still the same difficulty. It completely abandoned the principle of [one sound for one letter, one letter for one sound], so reading and writing are a bit different. This is entirely inconsistent with the logic of word organization.</p>
<p>Verbs are the most troublesome in English, but Basic English only selects sixteen verbs, plus the two auxiliary verbs Will and May, for a total of sixteen. Trying to include all actions with a dozen verbs is simply a fantasy that even a child does not believe. On the other hand, it has not changed the English verbs at all, and they are still irregular. For example, the changes of be, om'are'is'been'was'were, have not been improved at all.</p>
<p>Because Basic English is rigidly limited to 850 words, many of the things that are said can only be used to explain the meaning, so that people can understand and comprehend. For example, there is no word [gramophone] in Basic English, so it can only be explained as [a polished black circle with a dog drawn in the middle, in front of a speaker]. This is not only a long sentence, but also makes it difficult for people to understand, even inexplicable, resulting in many jokes.</p>
<p>In short, Basic English has not only failed to improve the shortcomings of ordinary English, but has made it worse, becoming a degenerated, retrograde language, a dead and useless language. It is really far less than a [pidgin] English.</p>
<p>If someone really wants to learn Basic English, then it is best to ask him to read a few [conscience words] from Mr. Zhang Menglin, the promoter of Basic English... [...The purpose of Basic English is to enable people to speak and write freely. After learning Basic English, we can say ordinary daily language, write letters, write essays, and read books made of Basic English, but if you want to read books written in standard English, you still have to use this as a basis and then learn...]. From these words, you can know that Basic English does not help us at all. We are stealing a little time during work to seek some knowledge. [After learning...] where is there so much time [to learn again]? If you want to learn English, it is better to learn a little [pidgin]. If you want to learn an international language, you should naturally learn [Esperanto] (Eeperanto), which is recognized by the world as an international language.</p>
<p>The illusion that Basic English can become a language has long been exposed! Don't be fooled again! The precious study time of us workers should be used for beneficial subjects!</p>
<p>Therefore, people like Mr. Shen are really our best model.</p>

<h3>The Story of Soviet Collective Farms</h3>
<p>— By Tian Qing</p>
<p>This was still the story of Chasovenka Village sixteen years ago.</p>
<p>Every morning and evening, the large bell in the church made a loud sound. The harsh winter of the North Country was quietly climbing into the courtyard. The poor peasants were anxious... [What to do? After working hard for a whole year, we only got no money and no bread. How can we live?] For the arrival of this severe cold, only the rich peasants and priests in the village were happy. They had the most fertile land and the fattest livestock.</p>
<p>The poor peasants went to the church to confess, prayed to God, and took the last few coppers in their pockets.</p>
<p>The raging tide of the October Revolution impacted this quiet village. The civil war began. Officers of the old Russian army came to the village. The rich peasants and priests welcomed these distinguished guests with bread and salt (this is an old Russian custom) and organized troops everywhere to attack the majority party and the poor. But soon the old Russian army was driven out, and another kind of regime was established in Chasovenka Village.</p>
<p>Time flowed like water. Chasovenka Village was gradually changing its appearance. The large bell in the church no longer rang every day like that. Only some old people still went to walk around as usual, but the belief in God had plummeted. This village embarked on the road of [new life].</p>
<p>The First Year</p>
<p>In March 1929, four vanguard peasants organized a collective farm, but according to the law, a collective farm had to have at least seven members. So the initiators began to talk to the poor peasants, explaining the benefits of this new plan... [Comrades, you must know that the way of life of our ancestors is no longer applicable now. We have to get rid of our poverty!] After a lot of effort, this propaganda gained seven new members. In this way, the first collective farm in this area was born, called [Organizer] (Organizator).</p>
<p>However, the rich peasants suppressed this new thing. They tried their best to lobby among the peasants to oppose the collective farm. As a result, the peasants of the group farm were ridiculed, the children of the collective farm were often beaten, and the farm's tools and equipment were destroyed. But the peasants of the collective farm were not afraid of these difficulties. They used all their strength to continue their collective work. They fought for a better harvest. They bought ten cows and seven horses. They built a large new-style [livestock farm]. Everything was carried out more successfully and appropriately than what individual peasants did. Work discipline was also established. The benefits of participating in the life of the collective farm were also demonstrated. In October of this year, the collective farm had united twenty-two operations. At the end of the year, the income of each operation in the collective farm was one and a half times larger than that of individual operations.</p>
<p>The Second Year</p>
<p>It was a certain day in March 1930. The village club was crowded with people. Many peasants even had to stand at the door and outside the window. This was a joint general meeting of collective farm members and individual peasants. A stack of requests to join the collective farm was piled on the table, totaling four hundred membership applications. Even the rich peasants asked the collective farm to allow them to participate, but they did not succeed -- fifteen applications were rejected. So on this day (March 6), the collective farm already had four hundred and ninety operations. The meeting unanimously resolved to seal the church and build six new-style collective [livestock farms]. New work began immediately. Within a month, the necessary construction work was completed.</p>
<p>From this time on, the collective farm advanced with flying strides.</p>
<p>The Third Year</p>
<p>In the spring of 1931, the collective farm began a new development. The participating operations had increased to five hundred, and established common canteens, nurseries... etc. In a [livestock farm] there were one hundred and ten cows. All the joint work -- sowing, harvesting -- was carried out unusually smoothly, and many machines and electricity were used. Cultural work also had amazing development, and illiteracy was quickly eliminated. Active peasants were sent to the city to study.</p>
<p>The Fourth Year</p>
<p>Relying on constant efforts, the harvest has increased more and more. Socialist competition united all the peasants, and everywhere was full of labor enthusiasm. In their spare time, the peasants read newspapers and listened to the radio at home.</p>
<p>The Fifth Year</p>
<p>In 1933, the collective farm decided on the following plan: to increase one thousand head of livestock, fifty pigs, five hundred rabbits, to build two [livestock farms] (each accommodating one hundred head), to increase livestock feed, and to expand the fields for planting various grains and vegetables.</p>
<p>Now, this collective farm contains five hundred and eighteen operations, which is all the population of this village except for the rich peasants. It has two hundred and forty agricultural machines and tools. The income of the collective farm is increasing every year:</p>
<p>Income -- 1929 -- 12,003 rubles</p>
<p>Increased by -- 1930 -- 88,220</p>
<p>One -- 1931 -- 661,271</p>
<p>Plus -- 1932 -- 1,024,455</p>
<p>Milk -- 1929 -- 1,795 liters</p>
<p>Production -- 1930 -- 45,544</p>
<p>Quantity -- 1931 -- 565,652</p>
<p>Increase -- 1932 -- 765,201</p>
<p>Each Collective -- 1929 -- 236 rubles</p>
<p>Farm Peasant -- 1930 -- 460</p>
<p>Income Increase -- 1931 -- 595</p>
<p>Plus -- 1932 -- 2,085</p>
<p>In this way, the Soviet peasants, on the ruins of a dark life, built a new, bright, free, and forward-looking life.</p>
<h3>Special Announcement from This Publication</h3>
<p>(1) The "Small People's Parliament" column has recently received a large number of submissions, but because some readers have expressed boredom with the text in the column, in order to adjust the tastes of all gentlemen, it has been temporarily cancelled and replaced with other text. Please forgive me! (2) The following columns of this publication are very lacking in manuscripts, namely: 1. Amateur Studies; 2. Amateur Art; 3. Amateur Sports; 4. Amateur Entertainment; 5. Employee Training; 6. Employee Self-Cultivation; 7. Industrial and Commercial Knowledge; 8. Industrial and Commercial Practical Science; 9. Interviews with Famous Figures in the Industrial and Commercial World; 10. Small Business Management Methods; 11. Occupational Anecdotes; 12. Academic Lectures: and other theoretical texts. I hope that friends from all walks of life will actively contribute manuscripts. I look forward to it immensely! However, please do not exceed 1,500 words per article.</p>
<p>In addition to the livestock in the [public livestock farm], each peasant of the collective farm also has their own livestock: sheep, pigs... etc., which are used to improve the lives of their families.</p>
<p>Occupational Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Several Special Women's Occupations in Japan</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>In Japan, there are many types of women's occupations. Most of the jobs that only men could do in the past now have women participating in them. But what I want to talk about here are a few special women's occupations. This "special" doesn't mean they are special in their own country, but rather,</p>
<p>they probably seem special to people from our country!</p>
<p>(1) AirGirl You can search through all kinds of English-Chinese dictionaries, but you probably won't find the definition of this word! This AirGirl is a new women's occupation that has emerged since Japan began operating public airplanes. Their job is to manage all passenger affairs inside the public airplane. Naturally, this kind of work cannot be done by women who are not very strong.</p>
<p>(2) Mannequin In today's world where promotional methods are already developed, you can't blame the owners of Japanese department stores for feeling that those wooden female mannequins are useless. Therefore, they have recently been using living people to promote their goods. These living mannequins are called "mannequins" in Japanese. Needless to say, their biggest requirement is beauty, and the next most important thing is perseverance. Sitting motionless in a stuffy ShowWindow for one or two hours is not something ordinary people can do!</p>
<p>(3) Dispatch Wife The meaning of "dispatch wife" is somewhat similar to that of a female housekeeper in our country. Because they are dispatched from the [Housewife Dispatch Association], they are called "dispatch wives." The job of a dispatch wife is to perform the duties of a housewife. Most of them are widows. Most of the clients of dispatch wives are single people, so this is a very dangerous occupation.</p>
<p>There are several other types, but due to space limitations, they are omitted here.</p>
<h3>Short News</h3>
<p>Miss Hu Wanxin, a famous socialite at sea, has profound attainments in both Chinese and Western studies. Her works have a unique style and are highly praised by gentlemen such as Xu Beihong and Yuan Junming. Recently, gentlemen such as Zhang Shizhao, Xie Wuliang, and Shi Liangcai have set the following fees on her behalf... A full three-foot piece is twelve yuan, four feet is sixteen yuan, five feet is twenty-four yuan, six feet is thirty-two yuan, and eight feet is sixty yuan; horizontal scrolls are the same as full pieces; vertical scrolls are 80% of full pieces; screen panels are 60% of full pieces; craftsman screens, four feet and four openings, are twenty-four yuan, five feet and four openings, are thirty-two yuan, six feet and four openings, are forty yuan; fan albums are four yuan each; hand scrolls are four yuan per square foot; gold leaf and meticulous work are doubled; figure paintings are doubled; ink fees are added by one; inferior paper is not provided; pick up the piece on the agreed date; payment is made before painting; the receiving addresses are Dazhong Middle School at No. 103 Kunshan Road in this city, and major paper and fan shops in the North and South cities.</p>
