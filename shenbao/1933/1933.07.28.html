<p>時評</p>
<h3>社會敎育之本質林</h3>
<p>［社會敎育］一名詞十稔以來聞之旣熟國内敎育家從事於此一事業之研究與設施者。尤不乏人。顧處於今日經濟與政治狀况之下而談敎育。固已綦難。處今日而欲談社會敎育則尤難。不過偉大事業之爲人類一般所迫切需要者。無不視尋常爲難。唯其難也。故其研究與施行之努力。更不容須臾緩。然則社會敎育。究爲何種之敎育乎。</p>
<p>或者曰。社會敎育與家庭敎育及學校敎育。相並立者也。人之生也。孩提之時。以家庭爲世界以父母爲依歸。與兄弟姊妹相處。舉凡父母之所敎導。兄姊之所詔示。弟妹之所與嬉戲跳躍。以及在此範圍内之耳濡目染者。皆家庭敎育也。及至幼而入學。由小學而中學。而大學。凡此時期所受之敎育。舉凡師長之所訓誨。同學之所切磋。以及學校之一切設施。足與學生以直接間接之啓。</p>
<p>迪或影響者。皆學校敎育也。然而吾人之單純的家庭生活。爲期至暫。至於學校。即敎育極發達之歐美先進各國。其所容納之學齡兒童與受敎育之靑年。比之失學者。相懸甚殊。即使全體兒童與靑年均受相當學校敎育。而其在校就學之年。比之出校入世之年。僅爲人生一小段落。則入世而後。社會必有各種含有涵養人類之德性。保持人類歷史之文化與騐。以爲輔導靑年進德修業之各種機能。此各種機能者。皆社會敎育也。</p>
<p>或者曰。人類原爲社會動物。當其孕育於母胎也。已承襲其祖先無數萬萬年之生理的。心理的。歷史的社會的。生活交織所得之遺傳。即與人類社會發生深切之關係。及其呱呱墮地。有產婆以助之。其所與接者父母兄弟姊妹而外則有乳母以哺之。又有保姆以護之。其社會關係。即日趨於複雜。舉凡此種關係所給與兒童之影響皆社會敎育也。及至入學校。從師就學。不但學校敎師與同學以及學校之一切設施。足以影響兒童與靑年。而由家庭至學校與由學校至家庭的過程之中。且有一極大無外之學校在焉。此一學校。無一定之敎室。茶館·酒肆·歌臺·戲院·皆敎室也。無一定之敎師。而熙來攘往。肩摩　繫者流。皆敎師也。無一定之學科。而林林總總形形色色。隨在均與人以剌激。起人之觀感。所謂［近朱者亦墨者黑。］［居楚則楚。居齊則齊。居越則越］斯即社會敎育也。</p>
<p>或者曰·［社會敎育］與個人主義敎育相對立者也。個人主義敎育。以個别之人爲對象。以少數人材敎育爲主題。而社會敎育則以普及一般靑年兒童爲主題。個人敎育。養成其個别獨立自順其身之性情。社會敎育。則養成人類共同生活與共同操作之習慣。歐美敎育家所謂［共同社會］者是也。之三說者·各有攸當。然吾儕就時代之演進與社會之需要論之。自以第三說爲勝。然此亦有唯心唯物之别。唯心論者以發展社會的共同道德。所謂［本質的意志敎育］爲出發點。即先訓練人類之共同意志以臻乎社會敎育所　向之的。是則社會敎育以人類之意志敎育爲基礎。換言之·即由人類意志產生社會。唯物論者則反之。主張以共同勞動爲形成共同社會之出發點。換言之·即以共同勞動之物質生活爲基礎。以產生共同意志與共同社會。必如此而後始有社會敎育可言。顧或者曰。美國實騐主義敎育家主張生活即敎育。敎育即生活。以此例彼。彼毌類似。其實不然。實騐主義的敎育。就其全體之精髓觀之·固亦一種社會敎育。然而彼之社會敎育。乃資本主義社會爲適應其商品生產商品流通。即剩餘價値生產之社會敎育。唯物論者的社會敎育。乃以直接生產者爲主體。而適應此主體之社會的生存與發展。此主體的社會文化敎育也。</p>
<p>就今日我國之政治經濟狀况而言。此等敎育。目前固尙難實現。但吾人前已言之。［偉大事業之爲人類一般所迫切需要者。無不視尋常爲難。唯其難也。故其研究與施行之努力。更不容須臾緩。］則吾人亦惟有不畏艱難。努力以求其實現耳。努力之道如何。一在乎着目於社會制度之改善。二在乎着目於共同生活意識之培植。循是以趨。庶乎其有發展之希望耳。</p>

<p>以上爲日報所載之一般情况、字裏行間、吾人隨處可看出其造謠挑撥之用意、至日本對此之措置、除向國聯秘書長、提出抗告、已被駁斥外、其主要對策、據日政府内之有力意見、則爲派遣杉村公使來華、以緩和我國之反日情感、取得彼所謂之對日公正態度、另外以美國爲非加盟國、亦將以親美政策、企得外援、但第一着仍爲派杉村來華、杉村曾任職國聯事務局、與拉西曼爲密友、與中國在國聯之外交家亦頗熟悉、但其是否接受來華任命、則尙未定</p>
<h3>杉村表示意見</h3>
<p>據杉村對日記者表示、謂拉西曼在華行動、與日本相關、極爲重大、除第二次華盛頓會議日俄漁業之改訂以外、日本退聯之决定、期在一九三五年、日本在明後年中、可以注力於各種計劃之活動、不借政府、即民間之團體、亦應澈底向此方向進行云云、但對被派來華、則表示固辭、杉村之意見、已爲日外相之考慮、然杉村自身、結局或將因政府之决心、而受諸委命、此爲日記者之預料語也、</p>

<p>上海電話局下月起</p>
<h3>自動取銷通話費</h3>
<p>惟因租界電話公司之堅持市府再令公用局恊助交涉關於華洋電話五分通話費、雖經市公用局、曁上海電話局·與租界電話公司、迭次交涉、因租界電話公司少有誠意、終無結果、現悉交通部上海電話局、訂於八月一日、自動取銷、函請市府、仍令市公用局恊助辦理、茲將市府訓令並今後交涉方針、探錄如下、</p>
<h3>市府訓令</h3>
<p>爲令知事、案准交通部上海電話局函開、竊照取銷華洋通話費一事、前經瀝陳鈞座、仰承鑒核、嗣閱本埠報載、俞秘書長談話一則、欣知此事已奉鈞府令飭市公用局恊助、尤深銘感、迭經本局與市公用局往返洽商、恊力進行在案、惟公司以權利關係、毫無誠意、茲因上海市商會及租界華人納稅會等來函敦促、本局爲便利民衆計、爲發展公私營業計、擬於八月一日起、由局方先行單獨實現、以副市民之期望、一面徐圖圓滿解决、至華界所接租界電話、每次除局方犧牲二分外、其應付公司之三分、暫由本局負担、知承　注、專肅上陳、等由准此、合亟令仰知照、此令</p>
<h3>交涉經過</h3>
<p>昨據市公用局發言人聲稱、查本市華租兩界電話用户互相通話、每次須納通話費五分、係規定於交通部上海電話局與</p>
<p>前上海華洋德律風公司所訂通話合同之内、迄今已有八年之久、公用局早認此項收費、不但使用户增加負担、感覺不便、且足以阻礙電話事業之發展、故於十九年三月、呈請市政府、轉咨交</p>
<p>通部、整理本市電話案内、亦列有取消華洋通話費一項、嗣奉市政府令轉交通部咨復、對於通話費一點、　華界與租界電話用户、從前不能互相通話、幾經交涉、始於民國十四年十二月接通、當時曾上海電話局、與華洋公司、訂有通=話合同、其收費辦法、亦經明白規定、不能由一方隨意更改、現此項合同、將於本年十二月期滿、自當飭局、於續訂合同時、與該公司磋商、儘量改善云云、嗣上項通話合同、於十九年十二月十六日滿期、其時交通部方面、對於此後雙方通話及其他重要問題、尙未表示辦法、公用局以華租通話、事實上勢難停止、其他關於電話之重要問題、亦難懸而不决、但久長辦法、自非急切所能</p>
<p>商定、爰卽建議、先訂臨時合約、以一年爲期、儘在此期限内、磋商此後久長辦法、雙方均表贊同、其後上海電話局局長與上海電話公司代表、第一次在公用局討論臨時合約草案時、公用局曾提議將華租通話費取消、以輕用户担負、惟公司代表、以取消通話費、對於公司收入影響太大、堅不肯同意、當以此項臨時合約、除雙方通話辦法外、尙有關於電話之其他重要問題、均亟待解决、未便久懸、目臨時合約、爲期甚暫、關係尙小、故經商定、通話費一點、暫照向來辦法、容俟另行提出討論、此項臨時合約、幾經波折、始於本年四月十九日簽訂、本擬於最短期間、磋商取消</p>
<p>通話費辦法、而上海電話局方面、則因改裝自動電話後、租費業已增加、如欲减輕用户担負、急欲將通話費取消、曾經幾度、向上海電話公司直接磋商、該公司始終以損失太鉅、及藉口臨時合約内收取通話費之規定、不肯同意、致未有結果、乃由上海電話局函請市政府援助、市政府卽轉令公用局酌辦、公用局奉令後、當以華租通話費之收取、雖爲臨時合約所規定、但取消通話費、係减輕用户担負、公用局爲謀市民利益計、自當盡力恊助、卽由第三科鄭科長、前往上海電話公司、切實交涉、但仍無結果、最近於本月二十四</p>
<p>日、復由公用局、邀請上海電話局徐局長、及上海電話公司副總裁吉祿·來局、繼續討論、公司方面、仍以臨時合約收取通話費之規定、及取消後公司收入减少、無法彌補爲理由、堅不肯同意、電話局徐局長、則謂、如電話局單獨取消通話費後、仍按通話次數、由電話局負責、付公司銀三分、則公司收入、絲毫不受影響、或許收入反可增加、是與合約規定、並無抵觸、最後公司方面表示、如電話局堅持非取消不可、事關電話局本身問題、公司固無法阻止、但决不能同意、是爲最後交涉取消通話費之經過情形、總之、電話公司雖竭力反對、但爲减輕用户担負計、總希望在可能範圍以内、早日取消、上海電話局、近以電話租費增加、欲减輕用户担負、　通話費單獨取消、並爲信守臨時合約收取通話費之規定、仍將每次應付上海電話公司之三分通話費、由電話局自行担負、則上海電話公司、自無法阻止、至上海電話公司方面、雖一時恐難强其取消、但仍當繼續交涉、務期早日達到取消目的云云、</p>
<h3>繼續交涉</h3>
<p>據市公用局第三科科長鄭葆成語中央社記者、此次交通部上海電話局自動取銷五分通話費、該局之自光可謂遠大、蓋華界暫時爲犧牲性質、但用户旣得便利、則華界請求裝置電話者、必能增加、營業上必可發展、同時租界用户之欲向華界用户通話、租界電話公司、亦向上海電話局繳納三分之通話費、以目前情形而論、租界之向華界通話、爲數較多、故該項收入、已足補償、反之租界電話公司、徒以目前租界用户較多於華界用户、而實行取銷通話費、似乎不利、但因此租界用户、旣感受與華界用户待遇上之不平等、且華界地面瞭闊、週年來市區之發展、甚爲迅速、則焉知於最近之將來、華界所裝置之電話、不能較多於租界乎、本局對於此次租界電話公司之堅持、實爲遺憾、本局對於取消通話費、將仍繼續恊助交通部上海電話局、向租界電話公司交涉云、</p>
<h3>向美收費電報停收</h3>
<p>下月初實行因匯兌關係大美晚報云、本埠各有線電公司與無線電臺、發出通告、自八月一日起、停收發</p>
<p>往美國之收電人付費電報、至其原因、聞至少有一家說明、由於匯價關係而起、又聞此舉係出於總公司方面之訓令、曾有某公司代表聲稱、此項訓令、聞在美國方面、同樣實行、故自星期一起、亦不能再有收電人付費電報、發往中國、但一般人仍信此舉係屬單方面行動、因慮美金再有漲落所致云、</p>

<h3>漁會計劃改進漁業</h3>

<h3>徵收問題</h3>
<p>關於漁業建設費徵收問題、據陳氏稱、前因漁商不明内容、以致徵收稍起糾紛、經虞杜二氏調停後、巳無問題、目下冰鮮業已全部照章繳納、鹹魚雖有一部份人主張包銷、餘亦依法照繳、然徵收處對於包銷問題、决難允准、（前報載舶來鹹魚建設費、本處擬招商分認、全非事實）</p>
<h3>用之於漁</h3>
<p>一般漁商以爲建設費與漁稅爲同一性質、實則各異、蓋漁稅値百抽百、爲政府收入、且經立法院明令取銷以示提倡漁業、建設費則直接由徵收處保管、其用意爲收之於漁、用之於漁、將收得建設費共建一切關於漁業改進之用、</p>
<h3>進行建設</h3>
<p>漁業建設費征收處爲改進漁業計劃起見、擬將征收之建設費、用之建設、（一）築漁業市塲於上海、（二）　漁港於嵊山、（三）建氣象台於沿海一帶、（四）設無線電台於重要洋面、（五）設漁業銀行於各重要地點、（六）添造護洋巡艦、以期漁業得有安全及福利、現已呈請實業部審核、聞實業部已交漁牧司計劃中、大致可蒙允准、八九月中卽可次第實現云、</p>

<h3>冷紅又名淚涯</h3>
<p>曾適人、旋又重墮風塵、在酬應塲中、被現任國華銀行董事長港粤兩埠金融首領鄧瑞人所賞識、從此妝台樓閣、過從無虚夕、未幾素芬生一女、現年十歲、題名湘玲、彼時陳即乘機要求鄧援之出火坑、並與同居、奈鄧早已有婦、且有季常癖、故雙飛之誓、終難如願、但鄧又恐</p>
<h3>事被大婦所聞</h3>
<p>滬公幹之便於三月初偕</p>
<p>同來滬、並恐熟人識破、故鄧仍居已之别墅中、陳則投宿華安、不時前往幽會、當案發之夕、鄧陳兩人曾同往舞塲酣舞、並在華安一度燕好、細語之頃、陳要求鄧籌一澈底辦法、但鄧遲遲不答、素芬</p>

<h3>應由湘玲承領</h3>
<p>但不明地址無法通知、後乃委託香港警務處長代爲設法調查、於半月前接得香港警務處之答覆謂湘玲現在寄居香港考斯灣法人所辦之聖母院中敎養、但湘玲年齡甚幼、未能前來領取、而該院院長法女亦不願負責代領、最後並建議可將此項遺物交由</p>

<h3>輪船茶房末運</h3>
<p>新銘輪茶房頭無弊局方斥革敢起反抗武裝彈壓驅逐上岸招商局總經理劉鴻生、因尊重部令、廢除輪船買辦、先將新銘輪試行、改派事務長、理貨客脚、改爲實報實銷、使機船與業務各自爲政之數十年牢不可破之惡習、實行打破、故事務長陳文鑫接事以後、第一注重者、制止茶房之䟦扈、嚴禁酒資之勒索、查新銘輪共有茶房七十餘名、其中一二不肖者、以無法需索旅客酒資、遂從售票上朦吞作弊、爲陳查悉、陳明劉氏、因將該茶房斥革、而引起糾衆毆打、抗命離船、及公會交涉之重大糾紛、直至昨日、始行辦妥、爰將情形分述如下、</p>
<h3>改制整理</h3>
<p>新銘由局收回自辦理貨客脚事宜、革廢買辦以後、劃鴻生特派陳文鑫爲該輪事務長、任事以來、因無包繳數比之惡例、故於艙位客室等、注重整潔、而旅客乘船之待遇、亦逐漸改善、對於船内之茶房、一時未便變更名額者、乃亦從管理上嚴定章則、明訂旅客酒資、不許如前之任意勒索、及有種種跋扈行爲、陳文鑫上船、本人祇帶去茶房一名、其餘仍爲原雇之人、</p>
<h3>發覺舞弊</h3>
<p>新銘輪上次自天津還滬、當時因友聲旅行團包租往普陀、及至開回上海、陳乃發覺茶房中、有茶房頭目第四人、對於所售旅客客票、有舞弊侵蝕情事、陳乃不動聲色、調查確鑿、遂於二十六日返滬時、親往總局、向劉鴻生報告、謂　查出舞弊之茶房四人、請示辦法、劉勃然大怒、决計將此害羣之馬、實行革斥、以排除整理之障礙、局方以此項茶房進退、常有中艙工會出而反抗、故劉總經理先派員至海員工會籌備會、述明事由、須將新銘之舞弊茶房頭等四名斥革、但結果未能同意、</p>
<h3>驅逐上岸</h3>
<p>劉鴻生乃於二十六日上午十時、密令南棧棧長準備護航隊數十名、派至金利源碼頭警戒、爲預防新銘輪作弊茶房之反抗、詎船内茶房頭蔣志高·徐進之等亦得聞此訉、乃集合一百餘人、各帶武器準備抵拒局方强令離船之命、其時碼頭上突然緊張、而捕房得訉、亦派大批探捕、前往彈壓、十一時許、由南棧棧長帶同護航隊上船宣布劉總經理之命、將舞弊有據之蔣志高·徐進之·茶房頭及茶房等四人、勒令上岸、初時徐蔣等猶堅强不肯離船、並欲動武、嗣見戒備嚴密、乃未敢與抗、祗得上陸、</p>
<h3>工會担保</h3>
<p>海員工會籌備會、亦由代表后大椿等到船、當時以作弊之事、證明爲蔣徐二人所爲、自應斥革、尙有兩茶房實無關係、不應同遭斥退、當經后大椿向局方出而担保、故該二人、仍令其回船復職、一切照新章從公、至於舞弊之茶房頭蔣志高等、擬送交法庭辦理、旋因各方之調解、値以斥退了事、一塲軒然大波、卽此了結</p>
<h3>遷怒他人</h3>
<p>蔣徐等强迫離船斥退職務後、船上七十餘名老茶房、羣起大債、乘局中人員離船之際、乃遷怒於陳文鑫之新用茶房應雲　、　起攢毆應遍體鱗傷、而各茶房於通打之下、更擬將其推入浦江、當時應受傷巳重、無法抵抗、而上身已被衆人推出甲板欄杆之外、行將翻身落水、幸爲水巡捕瞥見、急來救護、乃將衆人制止、應得未遭落浦、惟受傷過過、昨已送院醫治矣、</p>
<h3>運私罰欵</h3>
<p>該輪上次出口時、茶房私帶稍包、爲稽查察覺、上前阻止、茶房不服、遽將稽查毆打、當經報告南棧、並由水巡隊、壯行凶之茶房捕去、昨日經法庭判决、該茶房夾帶私貨、毆打稽查、罰洋二百十元、責令交欵開釋、</p>

<h3>鳳翔迴安互撞</h3>
<p>兩輪均打倒車不及避讓互撞本埠泰豐公司之鳳翔輪、昨日自汕頭進口、因潮水過激、與政記之迴安輪互撞、亟將詳情分記如下、</p>
<h3>水急相撞</h3>
<p>泰豐公司之鳳翔輪、自汕頭裝貨三百餘噸來滬、昨日下午二時三十分、開到浦江、將近楊家渡元一碼頭前、其時潮水甚急、鳳翔順流而進、此時政記公司之迴安號輪於元一碼頭裝足貨物、正於此際掉頭開出、其船尾方横至江中、鳳翔輪於急流中前進、當由鳳翔大副拉回聲一嚮、並打倒車、欲從迴安後船尾繞行、詎料迴安輪斯時亦打倒車、遂致不及避讓、鳳翔之船頭、乃撞入迴安船頭左側、迴安船頭當被撞凹、而損害尙輕、</p>
<h3>鳳翔碰破</h3>
<p>鳳翔輪以無法避免、而與迴安互撞後、鳳翔因靠浦西面停泊之漁船甚多、仍向浦中心行駛、詎知迴安輪頭纜解去掉轉船身時、迴安之船身已經掉轉、而船頭乃向鳳翔輪對面開來、致又二次猛撞、碰然一聲、鳳翔輪之頭部左舷、竟被迴安輪撞破一洞、而台甲之梯子等項、悉行撞毁、損失較迴安輪爲巨、兩船相撞之下、始各靠停碼頭、迴安仍泊元一碼頭、鳳翔停在鴻生棧、</p>
<h3>迴安停航</h3>
<p>此事發生後、雙方報告公司、政記公司得訊、以迴安輪滿船貨物、已經裝足、與鳳翔相撞之後、有無其他損傷、刻尙未悉、不敢貿然出口、恐有危險、當即迴泊元一碼頭、停止開行、俟檢查以後、方始再行、</p>
<h3>鳳翔卸貨</h3>

<h3>妬婦殺妾案</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>（二）意志薄北的女學生陳某人稱中華民國是中華官國，只爲人人貪做官，官是［位尊金多］的緣故。崇拜一位尊金多］的，不但，一個蘇棄的嫂子，凡是羨慕虚榮的女性，誰都要想做一位前呵後擁的官太太！做不到大太太，做一位姨太太也她，這是女界中的惡根性，漸且，沾染到女學生身上。所以，廣州某校素負豓名的女生陳某，伊竟倒顚於楊少修的位尊金多，不惜自降身分，做他的專房之寵。</p>
<p>楊娶陳氏作妾，另築着金屋藏嬌，本是瞞着髮妻黃氏的。黃氏雖略有風聞，而不曾證實；偏有不識相的楊老頭兒，寄來這一紙書，誤落在雌老虎手中，妬火的威權，高出於種種火熖之上，於是發生這轟動四方的妬婦殺妾慘案。</p>
<p>雌老虎以外，尙有一［　爺勤務兵］，實在可以［爲虎添翼］。這勤務兵，是黃氏的遠房兄弟，黃氏的殺妾計謀，勤務兵也曾參預秘密。假稱楊少修在大婦處陡患急病，致書於陳，着勤務兵送往，催陳速來訣别。陳氏愛夫情切，含淚前往。嘿！陳氏一入虎穴，便是以肉　虎，休想生還！從這天起，楊氏的愛妾陳某，便卽宣告失踪。</p>
<p>陳氏和現在留粤某中委有薄親，失踪以後，陳母痛不欲生，便慮其女死於非命；哭訴某中委密向公安局請求緝兇伸寃。於是偵緝長陳植雲，爲了此案，很費着一番偵緝手續，居然眞相大明。呈報總部以後，陳濟棠勃然大怒，便將楊少修看管，且須移送法院，按律懲辦；赫赫一時的紅人兒，額角上起着皮蛋色了。</p>
<p>偵緝長陳植雲，怎樣的破露這慘案？其中很有偵探小說的意味，將來可請程小靑先生編入中國探案之中。案情怎麽樣？請看第三篇。</p>
<h3>同情心</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>人類是頂醜惡的東西，那裏有所謂同情心呢？</p>
<p>暴日的肆虐，美其名曰··［開拓］！［景氣］！［爭生存］！開拓，景氣與爭生存，是不是爲你們小國民吃飯？穿衣？住房子？生兒子？中華民國向來是寛大爲懷的，當仁不讓丨中日之戰，五三之役，·····著著退步！退一步，再退一步！就是九一八，一二八，甚至熱河被佔領，淞滬，平津，濟南，漢口，·····等等地方，對你們人民一律平等，甚至於保護有加；然而，你們［倭子肚裏疙𤺥多]，節節進逼；[中日親善]，[和平解决][停戰恊定]，多麽美麗的名詞，現在事實證明了！是不是[蠶食]？[鯨呑]？[帝國主義的侵略]？哼！花樣翻新！一手遮太陽！那個瞧不出？溥儀怎樣？滿洲國怎樣？還不是你們助產成變態的畸形兒？硬綳綳在犬中華民國身上黴生塊贅疣嗎？</p>
<p>人類的同情心，縱有，也如流螢然，忽現忽隱，極少如日中天，大公無私，光明普照。</p>
<p>[我有好些書可以借給你看！]</p>
<p>『我可以送你一大批有價値的書！』</p>
<p>『哦！哦！哦！大家想法子！大家想』</p>
<p>法子！·····我一定帮助你！』</p>
<p>哈哈！可憐已極！說得比唱得都好聽！說來說去，畫餅充飢而已！</p>
<p>從這大大小小的兩件事看來，很可以說；『人類是頂醜惡的東西！那裏有所謂同情心？』大家互相欺騙而已；因之，以德報德的少，以怨報德的更少了。其實，他自己也正在［螺螄殼裏做道塲］呢！</p>
<p>因此，我主張各把同情整個兒表現在行動上面；把同情心的片子，扔在未來的二十年三十年，七八十年一百年之後，再檢出旋轉起來，聽聽是不是還變了音調？</p>
<h3>荷花池前</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>夏天的淸晨與黃昏，這兩樣時間，有一般的景色。一個人若要不辜負這景色，最好是走近荷　花池前，作片刻的勾留。、</p>
<p>這時天際發出絲絲的紅光，太陽艶麗而不薰熱；水面漾起金絲彩紋，織成一幅燦爛的倒影。倒影的周圍，密層層的　着亭亭玉立的靑蓮。遠望像是許多撑着綠傘的妙齡女郎，有紅有白的面孔，顯見其活潑天眞。在朝暾甫上的時分，你可以去偷看那副［花冠不整］的形容；在日薄崦　的時候，你可以窺見那副［朦朧欲睡］的姿態。這雖不是正面全容，然而也是廬山眞面啊！日中時，花冠齊放，那副端莊的面孔，又有什麽好看？</p>
<p>荷葉上有珍珠般的水銀球，有璧玉似的水銀塊，流動不停的閃灼出銀樣的光輝。荷風曳曳，吹來香噴噴的氣息，撲進鼻孔，沁入肺腑；令人不禁要仰首作深深地呼吸；一種無名的快感，會浮上心頭！然而當你再低頭望時，那先前存在荷葉上的水銀球與水銀塊，早已被那陣微風，打散到不知去向啦！新發現佔着荷葉的一角依舊動蕩流轉的，是另一此銀球與銀塊了。一種［物換星移］的感覺，又不禁爬上心頭。</p>
<p>忽然，耳邊一聲聲［知了］！［知了］！這是池邊上埀楊枝頭鳴蟬振翅發出的聲音。知了，知了，誰信其眞能［知了］？倒不如那雙不輕啓口的呢喃海燕，憑其天生爲輕盈體態，飛去飛來，掠着水面，擦及荷叢；那是多麽可羨啊！</p>
<p>魚在荷叢庇蔭下游泳自如，釣魚的人蹲在岸上，靜待魚上他的鈎。然而聰明的魚，此時不吃食，人便空埀釣竿，怨及滿池荷花，丨這眞毫無理由咧。</p>
<h3>雨生南來又怱怱北去祖　帳離席餞之以詩</h3>
<p>— 澂宇</p>
<p>君來訪故人。不辭千里道。我往送君歸。行色憐芳草。來去太怱怱。何以遺懷抱。君言世事常如此。行踪飄忽何須惱。昔嘗快意奮風雲。渡海乘查之絶島。美利堅與歐羅巴。縱橫法義盧森堡。異國情調有殊風。以之浸潤入文藻。歸來講席疊五茵。筆陣直把千人掃。餘事爲詩亦快哉。鉛槧日出無留　。邇來南北東西游。脫手篇章皆創造。始信詩與游有關。此中機括無人曉。我聞君所言。大抵皆要妙。詩道玄又玄。君能觀其徼。君固好游又善詩。西征一卷尤工巧。（君有西征雜詩一郑）刻畫山川類有神。形容人物俱精到。興觀羣怨理之常。澹宕淸空知者少。此游應有詩。南轅又北　。歸去藝術宮。俯仰窮搜討。彭士與莎翁。無妨賡杜老。中西冶一爐。價値連城寶。送君千里祝平安。一曲長歌風浩浩。（天風閣詩）</p>
<h3>抗日將軍新開篇</h3>
<p>— 張夢飛</p>
<p>此番抗日幾將軍。馬蘇李三個最馳名。他們是艱苦備嘗經一載。槍林彈雨過光陰。飛機大砲未嘗懼。挨凍挨飢苦萬分。眞所謂鐵甲身穿忘晝夜。指揮軍隊費精神。祗爲倭奴多猖獗。東三省拿來一口呑。所以是將軍報國盡忠志。願意犧牲一命拚。到底英英雄共仰慕。說中華尙有血性人。祗因缺少槍和彈。沒奈何退却痛傷心。今朝海外歸來日。民衆歡迎幾萬人。一瞻丰采方如願。到底英雄怎樣形。市商會裏開歡迎會。團體參加閙紛紛。軍人模範馬蘇李。禦外邊疆得幾人。我編這開篇也算去歡迎。（却酬）</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十二回寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍犧牲甘解甲戰士多情趙自强心裏想着，走到了院子裏，就和排長帶了兄弟們，向操塲來。兵士們到了操塲，立刻就作跑步運動。趙自强也就跟着他們跑了起來。原來早上起來開跑步，這是北方軍隊特有辦法。天氣冷到點水成冰，衣服不能抗冷，週身的肌肉，都不能去聽自己的指揮，而且兵士還光着托那其冷如冰的槍幹呢。這還怎樣的去下操，所以一到下操時，不問一切，首先就開跑步起來。跑得週身出汗有了暖氣，這就開始操了。這一天早上，却是特别的冷，天亮了許久，太陽還不曾出來。半空裏陰黯黯的，好像是要下雪。趙自强究竟是昨晚上沒有睡得舒服，他沒有那樣拚命的跑，身上倒也不感覺怎樣的冷，只是兩隻手垂在外面，手指頭凍得生痛。本待帶上袋裏的一雙手套，可是看看大兵們，就不想帶了。當軍官的人，願意人家說他不如兵士能抗冷嗎？因爲這一兩天，軍士們買的手套，原放在儲藏室裏的，現在快要檢閱都拿出來，預備着擺樣子，連長帶了手套，兵士豈能不帶？因之趙自强將手挪搓着，站在一邊，看排長們敎操。可是站住了不要緊，這宿霧裏刮來的冷風，把兩隻耳朶，吹得如小刀子不斷的修割一般。北方軍帽，都有兩個皮護耳，但自有護耳以來，未曾見人將這護耳取下過，所以趙自强站在這裏，只管是覺的耳朶冷却永不能記起帽子上有兩隻護耳，可以放下來的。他想着，這樣的跟着看操，這身上的冷，决計是除不了的，於是把一連人集中了，自己就站在隊伍面前訓話。（一四一）</p>
<p>㳺踪所至</p>
<h3>高橋一日</h3>
<p>— 黃克威</p>
<p>一九三三年七月中某一星期日之晨。</p>
<p>朝陽塗紅了臙脂，蹣跚地，浮上水平線。黃浦江罩着火紅的光，像古銅鏡似的，慢慢地走着的市渡輪，給染成了金黃色。</p>
<p>渡輪伸着那麽長的鼻子，冒出一縷一縷的黑烟，飄飄地升上去，和着浦東高烟突上的黑烟，在藍的，白的，紅的天空裡，跳着迴旋舞。七月的江風，兜頭兒撲着船梢，吹得大反領翻上耳刮子，怪凉爽啊！</p>
<p>水從船底下捲起來，嘩啦嘩啦地；向兩邊分開去，小　板一顚一顚的搖蕩着。</p>
<p>帶着一顆恐怖謹愼的心，在飛騰着白浪的江面上，在佈滿着武器的大兵艦的鐵掌下，駛過了川沙，慶寗寺，東溝，終於吾們的目的地！</p>
<p>丨高橋到臨了。</p>
<p>公共汽車啵啵地飛來啦，人們像潮水般湧上去；很僥倖的，吾們一行六個人，一個都沒溜掉，擠上了車廂，但汗水已像霉雨般的沾　了衣衫。</p>
<p>車瘋狂地駛着，一會兒，在高橋鈟停住了，於是吾們又那麽勇敢地擠下車去。</p>
<p>太陽已高高地掛在頭頂，到海濱浴場還有三里路，只得坐小車子去。</p>
<p>曲折的小路，那麽遠遠地，遠遠地綿延着。在葱　的樹蔭裡，放出一陣陣的蟬聲，大樹下有水牛酣睡着，小溪裡有孩子在洗澡，農人們搖着芭蕉扇，抽着旱烟，靜靜地躺在門口的竹椅上。在田間，嫩綠的稻苗，微微搖曳着，林蔭裡射下破碎的陽光，在蜿蜓的田埂上，偷偷地走着，走着，一副詩意的幽靜的盡圖啊！</p>
<p>小車從小路折入了乾燥的大路，黃包車和獨輪車就多起來啦。輪聲轆轆地交響着，螞蟻似的爬着，風捲着塵灰飛跑，吹得吾們喘不過氣當海濱飯店的高頂呈入了眼簾，吾們下了車到飯店去喝了幾瓶汽水，就一同奔到海濱去游泳。</p>
<p>海水那麽平靜地，正午的陽光，在海面上劃了一條藍色的直線，白色的帆船，白色的海鸛，點綴着美麗的海景，沙灘邊的草地上，搭着白底藍條的篷帳，營寨似的一個連接着一個。躺蓬帳裡休息了一會，就換着浴衣去游個痛快吧。曲線美的女性，健康美的男性，在泥黃的，　味的海水裡，載沉載浮着。</p>
<p>浪頭太大了，游了一會就上來，在吾們的篷帳邊，一頂大凉傘下，發現了幾顆亮昌晶的明星：</p>
<p>小妹妹黎明暉，穿着一套非中非西的黃色時裝，袖口是短的，褲管兒是大的，頭上戴着一頂黃的大笠帽，把小粉臉兒遮住了半顆，只露着兩塊人工造成的紅肋帮兒。伊跳着，笑着，好像忘郤了一切憂患。</p>
<p>甜姐兒黎莉莉整個身子黝黑地，伊甸園的蛇哪！伊沒有下水去，只把兩條大腿拿到水裡去浸一浸，而且大嚼其黃金瓜。</p>
<p>聽說還有但杜宇的一對藝術夫妻，高占非的一對多子夫妻，野玟瑰王人美。</p>
<p>一個撑着粉紅傘的紅衣姑娘，踏着跳舞的姿勢，姗姗地徘徊着，粉臉上有兩個淺淺的笑渦，於是引起了兩位朋友的談話：</p>
<p>『那不是胡蝶嗎？』</p>
<p>『不是蜻蜓啊！』</p>
<p>紅衣姑娘的臉兒羞紅啦，旋轉頭來，招了一個嬌憨的眼睛，是白眼？是媚眼？</p>
<p>海水眼着太陽光的移動變幻着，先灰白，淺紅，赭色，蔚藍，而沉藍。於是夜色開始朦朧了。拖着疲倦的身子，吾們向那來的路回去了。大上海又到臨了，都市正亮着無數的眼珠子在歡迎吾們哩。</p>

<h3>觀察</h3>
<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>如果你抓住一個『文學敎育，』問他關於『觀察』的事，這在他是最得勝的。他會滔滔不絶的告訴你『觀察』必須深刻；甚且旁徵博引，說某大師曾經呌每一個學生用一小時去看一片樹葉，某大師領了一班學生至十字街頭去看一個黃包車夫，而各所看到的是不相同，以及如何的在類似物的形象中找出各個的特徵等等。其實，問題是不會如此簡單。</p>
<p>魯迅在『兩地書』　，說過一件事。他的一個親戚，常在他母親那裏纏繞。有一次，他回家了，『卽出而大駡之。』這時丨</p>
<p>他竟毫不反抗，反說非常甘心。我看他未免太無剛骨，而他自說其實是勇士，獨對於我，却不反抗。我說，我是願意人對我反抗，不合則指袖而去的。他却道正因爲如此，所以佩服而愈不反抗了。</p>
<p>這樣的『勇士，』實有類乎上海人所說的『船辮子』和人打架的『英雄。』起始是，其勢洶洶的向着對方；第二步，是盤起辮子預備决鬭；等到對方眞的預備動手了，却呌一聲『且慢，』拔起鞋子就逃。逃是有理由的，『英雄不吃眼前虧。』實際上，這種人，本來就不曾預備『打』，逃，也不是爲着求援。形式上的『憤慨』，『决心』，『抵抗』，不過是一種騙局而已。</p>
<p>所以，說到『觀察』，從浮面現象上去了解，是不夠的不正確的。祗說現象，那秦檜何曾自承爲通金；而胡立夫會長，到臨刑的時候，也還要大呌其屈，說是爲地方而死呢。浮面的，現象的考察，你的結論將如何做？</p>
<p>不僅如此，有些事還會更令人糊塗。如這一回的多倫事件，馮玉祥先生說是『打』下來的，犧牲極大；而汪精衛先生却絶對的不承認，說是日本人『讓』的，未死一兵，未折一矢。又如技術合作的事，在一方面說來，是各國爲中國謀福利；另外的一種見解，却是帝國主義瓜分中國的更進一步的表現。這些事，各方面都說得頭頭是道，理正詞嚴。若就表面去說，這結論眞是無從做起。</p>
<p>『觀察』並非易事，於此可見。像前面所說的『文學敎員』那樣的敎學生，其結果，必然是把學生愈敎愈糊塗，愈糊塗愈莫明其妙。所以說，浮面的，現象的『觀察』是不夠的；要訓練觀察，必須透過一切事象的浮面，從本質上去了解。祗有從本質的理解上所獲得的結論，纜會正確，　能顚撲不破。</p>
<p>『觀察』的問題，事實上，也就是『認識』的問題。</p>
<h3>心腹之患</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>中華民族這位老太太，據說害了［心腹之患。］</p>
<p>心腹之患究竟害的那幾種毛病呢？據醫生說：上層是肺癆，一羣結核菌在呼吸器官作怪，渾身的血都給　們吃光了，面黃肌瘦，呼吸困難：也曾到别人身上借點血來，不久又吸光了。中層是盲腸炎和胃癌，那節老朽昏庸的殘廢的器官，發炎作痛，積於生膿；胃膜腫脹，作酸作痛。下層是肝氣痛和腸癰：肝火炎上，整夜失眠；痞積氣阻，運化不靈。再加以感冒風寒，内應外合。這位老太太病入膏肓，眞是危乎殆哉了丨</p>
<p>聽說這位老太太也頗有些家產的，那麽，何不請位郎中看看呢？老太太的左右前後，圍繞着一大羣三姑六婆：她們說：『觀音大士前面早已許過願了，如來佛前面的香灰也吃過了，張天師的靈符早掛在床前了，茅山道士的仙丹呑過三回了；還不靈，那就什麽都沒有用了！］老太太的小兒子，也曾經禮聘過一位西醫，决計替老太太開刀的。那些三姑六婆咆哮道：『洋鬼子！洋鬼子！你們這些被洋鬼子收買了靈魂去的，不許走近老太太的身！］老太太的次子，也曾禮聘中醫來把過脈，醫生說：［非用巴豆大黃重瀉一次不可。］三姑六婆又咆哮了：『善薩前面占過卦，喜神從東方來了，用不着什麽大黃·』甚至老太太長子所禮聘的一位著名郎中，只想請老太太吃點黃蓍黨參之類，三姑六婆還是咆哮不止。老太太目前的續命湯，第一是『香灰』，第二是『香灰』，第三還是『香灰』。</p>
<p>嗚呼！此其所以爲『心腹之患』歟？</p>
<h3>答友問鬼</h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>許多人都把四川看作奇異的地方，先生後後寫信問我，四川究竟有沒有鬼，却不指明是什麽鬼。有些人把古話文稱作鬼畫符，如今這　鬼畫符依然盛行，連學生也大大的寫作，其目的，做官當秘書以外，中學生說是爲着將來考大學，大學生說是爲着將來畢業以後敎中學生，如果所問就是　這種古話文的符的鬼，那末，可以說是有着很多的。</p>
<p>通常所謂鬼鬼祟祟，是指做事不大方，你欺我騙，任意說謊，說話呑呑吐吐，往往前後矛看；或者假公濟私，或者賣反求榮；常於黑夜奔走權門，對人擠眉弄眼表示意見的，這種鬼自然也有，而且不少。</p>
<p>又有所謂搗鬼的，就是揑造謠言，或者故意把些許小事化作大事，藉以使人驚惑；明明並無其事，却弄得像煞有介事。譬如有個靑年在同自己的親嫂子談話，無聊的新聞記者見了，不分皂白，就說是女學生怎樣怎樣，大做其文章，廣爲宣傳的，這種鬼也着實有幾個。</p>
<p>下半天有鬼到街上買東西一節，這種話我八九歲時也曾聽人講過，說是四川成都府，一到下午，每個店舗裏都得備一個盛水的銅盆，如果顧客所付的錢丢在那銅盆裏是浮在水面上的，那是紙灰，就是見鬼的標記了。我在成都，也常常於下半天到街上去買東西，從來不曾見到把我所付的錢丢到水盆裏去過，也不曾在店舗裏見到那樣盛水的銅盆。只是四川人有着一句很通行的駡人的話，呌作『鬼兒子』。照理，有鬼的兒子，當然有大鬼，好像他們承認有鬼同住着。不過也不能夠就此斷定四川一定有着</p>
<p>特殊的鬼，因爲駡人的話還有更通行的一句，就是『狗×的』，意思是由狗生出來的。狗只會生狗，人當然是人生的，但四川人常以狗×的駡人。我曾經親自聽到一個船夫拿這話駡他自己的兒子。可見無非表示憤恨輕視的意思。然而從鬼兒子這句駡人的話，我們可以知道，四川人是看不起鬼的。</p>
<p>固然，照着孔老夫子的話，談鬼的事不如談人的事要緊。目前的四川，發生問題的是兵，並不是鬼。上面所說的幾種鬼，並不是四川的</p>
<p>特產，恐怕各處都一樣，至少是差不多的。至於駡人的話，江蘇不是也有一句『小鬼』麽？</p>
<h3>市場</h3>
<p>— 依雲</p>
<p>這是世界的另一面。這　沒有綠色的幽光，也沒有醉人的爵士樂，更沒有漆黑的皮鞋以及波浪形的頭髮。這雖然也是一所娛樂塲，但可不是高級的。這兒有的僅僅是亂人聽聞的歌聲，以及令人眩目的花蝴蝶。紅的嘴唇不斷地向人吐着輕俏的聲音，軟軟的衣襟有意地向人送着花粉香氣；可是三步後却有一對烏黑的眼珠緊釘着。姑娘輕輕地笑了，［噲，嚇嚇，坐一回呵！］眼角不自然地向後瞟了一下；白長衫黑個子的土老兒無措了，紅着臉，手像打拱似的，『哦，哦···』於是，於是醉醺醺的口脂就在耳　送來。一個美麗的穿着長旗袍的姑娘，向着一個土老兒做媚眼，說軟話；但誰也不奇怪，他們是在做交易呢！</p>
<p>肩比着肩，花蝴蝶是在人叢中穿梭地來往，她們的眼睛裏露出了餓　般的搜索的光芒。她們也穿了高跟鞋，也挽了皮夾子，但她們已失去了少女底美的愛慕，美麗的服裝只是她們底店招，櫃飾；無表情的臉，掩盡了她們自己所有的喜怒愛怨，她們只知道機械地笑，機械地向着每一個挾有銀色的人笑，她們是商品化了的被陳列着兜賣。</p>
<p>一個敞開了大襟的，大踏步自後面蹣跚地過來了，出其不意在一個站着的大腿上撞上一下：『哈哈』，回過來再扮上一個鬼臉。不自主的一嗔後，立刻也跟着嘻嘻地笑了，『阿姨』望站着不遠的黑眼珠招呼了一聲，蹌踉地挨着肩頭跟了過去。</p>
<p>一笑，笑在每一個角落裏泛着，於是買賣也在每一個角落裏成交着。</p>
<h3>關於『豐災』的作品</h3>
<p>— 鳳吾</p>
<p>由於客觀上的事實是如此，在一九三三年，豐災的描寫，是成爲作家們的主要題材之一了。就我所看到的，在小說方面，有茅盾的『秋收』（申報月刋，］葉紹鈞的『多收了三五斗』（文學；）戲劇方面，有白薇的獨幕劇『豐災』（中華月報；）在電影，李萍倩的『豐年』（明星）業已開拍。這當前的嚴重的事象，是很普遍的反映在藝術的各部門了。</p>
<p>這裏我想說的，祇是小說與戲劇的兩方面。葉紹鈞的一篇，寫的是農民在豐收後幻想的破滅，取用了糶米的一塲面。白藢的戲劇，則是寫豐災旣成以後，農民抗稅抗租的血鬥。茅盾的小說，是應該連接着『春蠶』（現代）和『殘冬』（文學）作一個系統看的，農民無論在那一方面獲得豐收，結果仍不免於飢餓，這飢餓逐漸的形成了他們爲自己利益的戰爭。三篇作品，描寫的重心雖各自不同，但他們的目的則一：企圖描寫豐災的事象，說明豐災發生的一些本質的原因，以及農民在這樣生活環境中必然的自覺。</p>
<p>『在這樣生活環境中必然的自覺，』這力量表現在葉紹鈞『多收了三五斗』裏，是比較的不夠的。以賤價糴出了自己的米的農民，雖然也曾想：『往後沒得吃，就來吃你們的，』却並沒有勇氣這樣做。結果，還祇是『借債繳租，』『忍痛吃官司，』『沉溺賭博，』『退租不種，』</p>
<p>『到城裏去。』如果我們單純的，觀念的，要求文學祇是社會生活現象的反映，而這反映不必是全般的，對於這一篇作品，可以給予很好的估價。但事實，是不容許我們這樣想；因爲任何一種或數種事象，要是從全般的現象拉開，在整個社會的機搆上是不可能，對於現象的本質原因，也不會獲得正確的理解。所以，在工作的進行上，全體的抓住一切關係，一切現實契機，具體的，把它描寫爲『許多的各種規定的總結，』描寫爲『多樣性的統一，』是非常的必要。而作者，是把現實的主要一環丨鬥爭的，反抗的農民，完全的抺殺了···（未完）</p>
<h3>平凡的事（二五）</h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>『老板，這是張先生跟着我們一同親看見的！我們沒有說一句虚話！』『我的意思，和各位的也沒有多少不同，』伯唐慨切地說，『不過，我也得把廠裡的事和家裡的事通盤籌算一下，才好切實答復。各位今天都很辛苦了，並且儘管我眞能殼拿些甚麽去接濟，儘管閘北的情形，越來越緊，可是今天這時候已經天黑，拿出去也還是用不到的，所以我們的答復更不妨略爲遲一點！···遲一點，眞正不過是遲一點，並不要三天五天，只要算出了一徧總賬就是可以有回信的！請各位明天兩點鏡再來談罷。］</p>
<p>老板，謝謝你，』邱代表說，『能殼更早一點就更好了！』『那末就是十點鏡罷，』伯唐說，『反正張先生總得在這裡，算完沒有算，不是只有我一個人可以曉得的。你們大家都吃了夜飯再走罷。』</p>
<p>這一場談話就此暫告結束了。伯唐之所謂算一篇總賬，就是預備從廠裏的和家裡的經濟力量上面，找一個妥善的方法，來掃除自己以上的矛盾。</p>
<p>伯唐終於和之光在樓上書房裡動手來算總賬了。他開始就問：</p>
<p>『之光，照現在的情形看來，敵人屢次增援，我們的力量也不怎樣弱，友邦也有加派艦隊來華的舉動，那末這一仗究竟會延長到甚麽時候呢，照最短的時期想？</p>
<p>『這個，』之光遲疑地說，『這個···姑且打算還要三四個月。』</p>
<p>『對呀，三四個月，自然是好壞可以有一個結果！但是我們自己的事，無論預備結束或者還預備拖延，我想至少總要兩個月才看得出路道來，你說對嗎？』</p>
<p>『也不妨這樣假定。』</p>
<p>『那末我們對於廠裡要籌劃的，就是這六十天之内的同事們的薪水，一部分長雇工人的伙食，或者工錢，以及廠裡的零星開銷，此外還要加一　在那時候應用的遣散費。這樣，數目就很可觀了！儘管一切往來上的賬都通盤懸起！』</p>
<p>他們拿着算盤各自推撥了一回，認爲至少也得七千元光景。</p>

<h3>糧食浦東新粳已上市</h3>
<p>價開八元一角</p>
<p>（滬南）本埠新粳已上市、較客歲爲早、該貨爲周浦益泰行運申、由南市新昌碾米廠碾白出售、價開八元一角、米質乾潔、稻色淸凈、誠爲今庚本埠新粳上市之第一聲、至河下來源四十餘號、本街店胃再懈、兼之來貨較夥、市續呈疲、客帮包胃雖動辦較多、然客家吃盤非小不取、故薄稻行情亦見垂軟、統計各帮厚粳薄稻杜洋尖價均修一二角不等、變陰元略爲平疲、所有包胃去路、共有一千數百餘包、據聞都爲靑島帮辦進、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日浦東新粳已見、约計十四五石、貨品尚佳、價開八元一角、據來客云、照此天晴、尙有續到、昨河下西路到船約十五六號、白粳走北淸淡、市形頂定、中次疲尺外、薄稻到少銷平、價高貨見定、次貨較弱早稻修近尺、羊杜尖亦小一角埠客尖又見疲勢、白元仍屬下游、</p>
<h3>秈米客化活潑</h3>
<p>昨日客秈、又轉活絡、因如地早米各瓜熟稻等卽將上市、而產地存積陳米陳榖尙多、一般以成本高昻、而不肯賤脫者、乃有活動於售銷、進户則因前存漸少、當地新米有待、正可趁此市價低平時早爲辦裝、以免靑黃不接時期、反出高價進本、因此時有内地帮及廣州帮去數雖少、但有繼續裝運之意、又適貨主情願隨市脫手、不再扳價、故此後市面、似有繼續活潑之可能、到頭亦可因此引動、昨日計内地去湖南機紅一百二十包、價七元半、福州去糙紅二百六十包、價六元一角半、寗波去　靖四百零三包、價六元一角半、蕪湖機元一百十包、價九元三角一分、廣州去無錫羊尖二百零四包、價八元七角三分、温台去無錫糙　二百包、價五元七角、南京糙五十包、價五元四角、無錫車米因河到銷活、價亦跟漲、其餘均形挺站云、</p>
<h3>沙市新菉豆開四元六</h3>

<h3>遠期粉荆棘横生</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份在致呈疲落不前之狀、洋麥報價、雖芝加哥仍漲一元七八角、坎拿大漲一元左右不等、惟國内情形、則已與國外背道而馳、因北方粉銷、本來在新粉時期、必能湧旺、今則農村破殘之餘購買减色、此種情形、實爲不可掩飾之事、人心轉軟、不爲無因、更傳東北方面、將實行加稅、則此後粉銷、恐將愈見不利、所以遠期人心、遂無形更疲、至廠方祗小廠略有出檔、大廠無出入、收盤結果、本月份較前日小五厘、八九月份小七厘半、十月份小一分二厘半、十一十二月份小一分半云、</p>
<h3>小麥期現均見萎靡狀愈</h3>
<p>昨日期麥、本月份上午幾盤、形勢依然不佳、最低至三元六角六分、下午初亦平平、至收盤時、因有未合格之套頭收進、市面遂提高三四分、此種情形、純係標準問題、於事實上仍少出入、至遠期各月份、因目下各路到貨均湧、小廠及行家、均已吃足、無意再進、大廠祗福新尙見活動、所以人心益趨不振、結果本月份未動、八月份至十一月份均跌二分、現麥市面、因本埠廠家、或有多量洋麥、或則爲粉銷關係、進胃甚懈、掮客之貨、均思走脫、致形勢又入萎靡、各檔又短三五分不等、開姜堰麥三元七角、　潼麥三元七角一分、高郵麥三元六角七分、次六角半、揚州麥三元六角、次五角七分、黃橋麥三元六角八分、興化麥三元六角六分、六合麥三元五角七分次五角半、浦口麥三元五角半、計一萬餘包、由福新辦去云、</p>

<h3>絲茶絲市益呈暗淡</h3>
<p>（江寗招商發展秋蠶）江寗自治實騐縣政府、近因發展秋蠶、特向合衆　桑改良會南京製種塲、訂購秋蠶種一千五百張、擬在縣屬淥口鎭等處試放、奈農村經濟崩潰、購種無資、現特招商墊欵購種、每張定價一元、先付八成、將來產繭卽由該商收買、墊欵卽由繭價扣還、（未墊欵者不得收繭）、本埠絲繭商昨均接得該縣政府通告、携欵赴寗登記矣、</p>
<p>（錫新廠經續有運滬）月底已届、本外埠各廠商承抛本月份之期絲、均須依期交解、是以無錫新廠經現正陸續運滬、連日滬錫等客車又裝到月兔金　等牌一百二十件、</p>
<p>（人造絲客銷轉暢難）人造絲秋銷已過、客帮進胃益减、昨祗蘇滬等處綢商進綠金魚紅金鐘等牌現期貨二十箱、價一百七十四元五角至一百六十二元二角半凈盤、</p>
<h3>綠茶交易突趨旺盛</h3>
<p>昨日婺源屯溪歙縣等路綠茶、交易突然旺盛、全市交易達四千二百餘箱、其中貢熙一項、最爲活潑、蝦目針眉、亦異常俏利、路莊土莊珍眉、去路均見發動、緣海外市塲、因本年華茶價廉、購買力大見增加、上海各洋行、又得悉内地茶數减折、不得不爭先搶辦、預料綠茶市面、尙有繼續發展之望、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢絨定價上漲</h3>
<p>呢絨毛貨趨勢、昨仍淸疲、因天氣炎熱、夏貨需要絶微、致無躉批交易、而秋冬需要之毛織品、客帮則咸有問津、大半多先札碼單書票暫記、俟貨到埠再出、同業中對於二十三年之新貨、日來大有定落、近則略見停滯、按洋行方面、紛接國外機户來電、謂毛價見漲、申地做開之價、亦須相當酌加、因之定貨號家、暫抱觀望、聞定價之上漲最勁者、首推新中庸之人字啥咪呢、查該貨前次定到每碼爲四先令十一便士、現廠方來電、原價須做五先令七八便士、洋行家加佣、其他各貨平均上漲一二便士與三五便士不等、故目前洋行定貨生意、遠不如上半月之旺盛、其十一二月份裝船之貨、因之减却不小云、</p>

<h3>歡迎歐洲佛敎徒來華受戒</h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>日昨各報本埠新聞欄均以頭號標題并大書特書［歐洲佛敎徒來華受戒］新聞。大意：此行善男信女共十五人，和尙七，尼姑八；論國籍，法七，德三，意二，比，匈，立陶宛各一；年齡最高者爲一女尼六十歲，最輕者爲一靑年和尙僅二十有一。彼等皆爲知名之士，專門學者，國會議員，銀行專家，［近因］崇奉中國佛敎，特在巴黎組織佛皈依團來我中華佛土削髮爲僧，皈依我佛如來［據說要到二年後才在我中華佛都的寳華山寳華壇受戒）。是日海上佛徒鉅子，大居士，大禪師，以及敎會代表，照空和尙等：均到碼頭執黃旗作合十的歡迎，登岸後賓主一行百餘人浩浩蕩蕩地直赴大西路一三一號巨厦而來。又該團登岸時，碼頭旅客聞此輩係外國和尙、一時如鶩而集，交頭接耳甚爲驚奇云云。小之亦是佛敎最忠實的信徒，雖說頭腦子頂上沒有用香燒成好些白點，也沒有入黨吃過敎，可是我是自命爲佛敎的［門外的忠實同路人］。所以這次事先沒有風聞，不然總該當燒着香沐浴潔身後躬自上碼頭去恭迓這一十五尊知名的有資格的西洋羅漢活佛菩薩，這是我一生禮佛吃齋而引爲終身第一大憾事的！然而往事已矣，要不然難道還呌這些活菩薩重新駕回輪船然後再由我扮演一齣執黃旗合十歡迎的喜劇不成，所以我唯一的彌補這一終身大憾事並贖回［失迎］之罪的方法，就是來寫這簱［歡迎］的文字，並申述大義，盼衆生讀過之後都來皈依，並忠實熱誠地擁護這一十五尊有資格的西洋同志，活佛菩薩！</p>
<p>衆生要知道［近來］西洋人之所以［崇奉］我中華的佛敎而竟成羣結隊來皈依，這最大的功勞便是得力在民國二十年九月十八日我佛摰愛的信徒少帥張漢卿和平將軍放棄瀋以至東北四省的那一着棋上！因爲我佛最戒殺生，而戰爭自然就是大規模的屠殺，我們的和平將軍張少帥虔信佛敎，遵守戒律，所以情願不發一彈把軍隊退回關内，這是何等値得大書特書的無量功德，而足以爲世界崇奉景仰的！去年咱們國内又盛大熱烈地度了一個經咒救國年，時輪金剛法會，金光明道塲，國師班禪，活佛章嘉，以及黨國元首，中央要人都莫不皈依和贊助，再加之最近國内和平果然實現，僞軍果然編遣，戰區果然接收某院長又勸令舉行［普利法會］追薦陣亡將士等，這些明白人當然知道都是我佛佛法無邊冥冥中顯靈聖的緣故，又難得外帶加上少帥　除了嗜好躬赴海外去宣外佛旨等等，這些，這些，很自然的西洋人便來皈依了（碼頭旅客不知交頭接耳驚奇些甚麽，眞可謂不明時勢，不懂眞理之至！）所以這是很可喜的事，因爲從此我們中華民族愛好和平的精神能夠深深地灌入這十五位知名的有資格的西洋活菩薩的心靈裏，二年畢業受戒後，再由他們分道回國大慈大悲地去發揚廣大的宣敎，則黷武國當然便會效頑石而點頭，屠刀放下，全世皆佛！至於世界和平，大同世界等等，那是不成問題的。</p>
<p>所以我們這次歡迎［歐洲］佛敎徒來華受戒］的意義至爲嚴重，使命至爲偉大，價値至爲無上！因爲這樣一來，野心國對我的屠刀可以放下，則我對［外］無需［攘］，而可以安安穩穩一心一意傾全力地來［安内］，豈不好哉！豈不妙哉丨</p>

<h3>上海的將來</h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>一語破的：［上海的將來，是了不起的繁華！］這不待劉伯温式的預言家來推算，也毌須乎科學家來引證，只除了情　孩子與生理不全而無小腦機智的人以外，是誰都會信任無疑。目前的事實，就是顯明的佐證，看啊，繁華核心的銀行，旅館，戲院，游藝塲，大公司，不在年年增加麽！建築已由三五層增高成普通的十多層，據說在最近的將來，南京路靜安寺路就有二十四層三十二層的大厦出現。那麽，三五十年而後，像紐約那樣的五十層六十層崑崙山似的房子也就不難出現於黃浦灘頭。老於上海的人說，三十年前，滬西閘北還是漫野荒地，街上只見馬車擁擠，像東亞巨富哈同氏也不過坐的是彩花馬車，現在呢？</p>
<p>然而也有人躭憂丨丨上海的將來，不是繁華，而是　滅，比如［一二八］一　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　這麽來一套，法帝國美帝國也都來一套，那就會使上海被毁滅掉沒有多少了。若是各帝國火併而大來一套，即假使世界第二次大戰發生於上海的話，那更毫無疑義的會整個的毁滅。吾對曰：唯唯，否否，决不會也，第一因爲［不抵抗］，［長期抵抗］，早已在咱們國度裏栽根茁苗，而至成長，各帝國如欲學日本的樣，就索性把整個上海無條件讓給他們，這樣便不致惹起戰釁了，上海也就可繁華下去。第二據說十年之後，日本必自滅，那麽，各帝國也難保不同歸於盡，那眞是咱們的天下了。就是×博士也</p>
<p>曾昭訓過我們要有自信力，［五十年後，中國必能戰勝日本！］那麽還怕别國麽？所以說來說去，上海是終不會再有戰爭出現，也就是沒有毁滅的恐怖的到臨。</p>
<p>無疑的［將來的上海，是了不起的繁華！</p>
<p>不過期待這繁華的到臨的，却有兩種截然不同的人與截然不同的期待見解一種是幾世修來的豪富的人，他們是在窩心的期待着上海的更繁華，最好勝過歐洲的花都巴黎，美洲的金城紐約，花花炫目，容易把光陰混過，多幾套化錢的玩局。在日常生活方面，最好乘坐飛機往　逼雲際的公司樓台去購買時新東西，飲食能有自動機送下肚腹，不要有大便間，想要排泄，就有一種機器或藥品來化解，而美的女人，最好進化到可以任意使用。至於說到氣温，最好有一種［護身］冷氣和熱氣，可以隨季換用，隨人發生作用，不要在室内裝什麽熱氣管冷氣管，以至到了暑天要爬牯嶺，冷天又要披笨重的毛　。</p>
<p>另一種便是衣食常不得温飽的貧漢，他們期待上海的更繁華，第一是堆積在一些大公司裏的食物樣品，不要把也　　　勿用，更不要　　　　壞了，　能隨人所欲，供大衆享用享用，其次便期待有許多不要錢的戲院游藝塲出現，可以隨他門進去吐出一口積壓在心頭的悶氣，也略略欣賞一下藝術。再次便期待有許多的小學堂，中學堂，大學堂，給他們的孩子讀書，有閒的時候，自己也像廣東一位六十三歲老嫗小學生一樣，進去點開一雙老跟。此外自己能製汽車飛機，自己也有資格去坐汽車坐飛機。至於排泄與女人等等，那只要大家蹲馬桶，每個有一個黃臉婆伴宿，也就十足滿意了。</p>
<h3>至影院去了</h3>
<p>— 虎</p>
<p>汽車在樓下嗚嗚地呌了三聲。！！喂！聽見嗎？汽車來了太太嬌裝的説。</p>
<p>！！你先行，我就來！很笨重的音嚮。</p>
<p>電話鈴又鈴鈴鈴的嚮起來。</p>
<p>丨丨畏，你是那一個呀？太太趕忙接起來問。</p>
<p>丨丨呌你去打牌呀！怎樣？太太回頭對老爺說。</p>
<p>丨丨回他我九點鐘才來！</p>
<p>電鈴　的一聲落下來。</p>
<p>汽車在樓下嗚嗚嗚地又呌了三聲。丨阿八！看住門！有人來找我，說他看戲去了有什麽緊要的事，九點鐘的時候到中山大酒店四樓。</p>
<p>電話鈴又鈴鈴鈴的嚮起來。</p>
<p>丨丨别管他，我們走。讓阿八去回話。</p>
<p>於是，高跟鞋和皮鞋在光滑的石梯上挨着嚮！</p>
<p>戲院前是那末的熱鬧。汗酸味直衝到行人道上。</p>
<p>太太的玉手挽住老爺的老臂膀，走下車來！臉上堆滿着快樂的微笑，包廂的位子，老爺老早用電話預定下來的。在戲院裏，無數的人頭在樓的上下鑽動，汗酸味繼是一陣一陣的傳開去。許多的靑年學生的模樣的，手臂上挽着外衣，又把恤衣的鈕扣解開，露出一個被汗水濕透了的背心和上半節赤色的胸脯。正在流着汗。</p>
<p>太太行過這一邊，用很討厭的口吻說：</p>
<p>丨丨廣州的戲院實在太糟，沒有一問會放出冷空氣來給人們逗一下。總是熱得人頭暈，悶得人死！</p>
<p>丨丨廣州總是廣州，當然比不得香港！老爺說。</p>
<p>丨丨眞的，香港總是香港，住在香港怪舒服的！我們幾時又要去香港住它一個禮拜。不，要多一點才好算數。丨丨隨便幾時都可以，那也用得上說嗎？</p>
<p>兩個人，坐在包廂裏，三邊是木的板子擱着。電風扇在頭上虎虎地轉着。兩個人的身子挨近去，再挨近去，一點也不覺得熱了。</p>
<p>停了一會，太太又嬌聲的說：</p>
<p>丨丨向樓下望去，眞像是一堆烏頭的可憐蟲！</p>
<p>丨丨那些窮酸貨·看他做什麽？、</p>
<p>說着，老爺就快樂的笑起來，太太也跟着笑着。</p>
<h3>徘徊在歧途上的靑年</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>弟弟寄來一封信，說在會考的騷擾聲中，也算中學畢業了：而且幾度的爭執，母親免强地同意他進大學。最後他俏皮地寫着哥哥這一點我比較你幸福！當然在我們故鄕的習俗下，及母親的執拗皮氣，弟弟僅僅費了幾度爭執，就能達到進大學優待權，無論你怎樣說法，這一點他是比你任何人都幸福的。</p>
<p>我中學畢業出來，爲了强自入大學，家庭武力抵制，斷絶了經濟的供給。我剛投身入大學之宫僅短短的一年，就現代名人書畫之二十三</p>
<p>被逼踏進社會之門了：但是和我同時代的人，現在不也都是大學畢業了嗎？大學畢業後怎樣？娶了妻子在家中預備做爸爸。我的弟弟有踏進大學的幸福，而沒有安坐飽食的幸福；所以對於他這欣欣然的來信，我沒有回他，恐怕傷他純潔的糼稚的心，讓他帶着幸福的驕傲去一探大學之宫吧！</p>
<p>但是這是四年的生活，學依是要被逼　進社會之門的；雖然我不知道四年後的中國社會，是否較好於現在，他不免苦痛，或者更甚於沒有進大學之前。我似乎看見他在探求深奥的書籍，爲了一個字的不解，查遍了各種字典；爲了一個數目的錯誤，排列了滿紙的竑程式。他不怕熱，不怕辛苦，他們想着他的美的之夢實現。</p>
<p>不過這夢境很快的令打的粉碎。於其使他痛苦於後，不如痛苦於前，所以　　　提起　想　　給他，往往費了一整　　時間　　　　　較好的措辭　　　因爲他以爲進大學是幸福的。</p>
<p>最近社會的不景氣，農村的經濟破產，成羣的人在這不可救的狂濫中掙扎。弟弟旣沒有安坐飽食的幸福，於其將來參加十萬倍於現在的失業人叢中，還不如把進大學的經費來努力自己的事業，但是我怎樣挽救一個徘徊在歧途上的靑年呢？</p>

<h3>店員通訊怎樣反抗？</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>前數日店員通訉欄内所載羅鎭森君請敎的一封信，及聰明的編者先生所解答的；我捧　再三，的確，這個問題，不但羅君的同行中如此，就是敝同行中也是如是。我想不但敝同行中如此，恐怕要佔商界中百分之九十以上呢</p>
<p>。我也是同羅君處於同一地位的學業已滿，而得不到薪水的人。我們的經理也是目光如豆的一個。</p>
<p>現在的資本家剝削我們如此，我們應當是要起來反抗那剝削我們的資本家的，但資本家這樣剝削我們，他們是得不到好處的，如先生所答羅君的話，［但要想他忠心兩字恐怕是夢想了。］這句話再切實也沒有了。</p>
<p>先生答羅君的未一句，［莫說中國人個個是懦弱的，幾十個人中間，難道連一個强者都沒有嗎。我眞不信，羅君，你等着罷］，這句話的確是對的，但是在這樣的時勢之際，要怎樣來顯强的本領呢；羅君的問主要就在這一句；我想若團結一店中的學徒及職員，大家起來反抗，乃其中有經理先生的親戚，（這是根據我所在的店中）及經理先生的拍馬獻媚的傀儡，走了你們反抗的幾個，還有幾個人，在，况且現在失業人多，各處人浮於事，要招請顧用幾個極其便當：聯絡團結全上海的學徒及職員，（這職員因經理剝削學徒對職員當然也要剝削所以也有聯絡職員）的可能在現在的時勢，我想是不可能的事罷，因所一般金融都操縱在資本家之手，有財有力這是當然的，他們可以制我死命，這未免太顯懦弱罷，但如上面所說他們有傀儡相帮呢，若以一人之怒，是强者，起來反抗，這一舉是敲碎飯碗，在可惡的資本家口中，說一句滾蛋而矣。</p>
<p>最近在敝店中，與我相差十幾天進店學業</p>
<p>的兄弟，他因爲學業已滿，而得不到薪水，並累受資本家張牙舞爪的一種設駡，不可入耳的種種排頭；就鼓着勇氣，離店回家去了，他臨走的時候因平時與我非常親密，還對我說，［天無絶人之路，難道離開那資本家所舞爪淫威的剝削的商店，就會餓死嗎！就是餓死，我死於農鄕也夠我自足了。］</p>
<p>先生　　的可算是　　？不知在他的後面，有人在　　他　　　　　的　者先　　　　問　　你給我　　後之　　祥細解　。</p>
<p>答：反抗當然不是口　的，個别的，分散的，　動的，雜亂的，而要是行動的，整個的，集合的，有目的的有組織的。來信所說某君因店中不給薪水而辭職回家，道不是反抗，是屈服，是瞎動！何以見得？反抗是要鬥爭的，譬如日本人來打我們，我們就要立刻還手打他，打得過打不過是另一問題，而我們之必須回打，那是無論如何不能否認的。盡所有的力量，回打到底，打勝也罷，打敗也罷，非至最後一息，决不罷手，此之謂反抗。若看見日本人來，我們就讓他，說：好！你兇，我讓你，看你再打得着打不着我。說着一溜烟退回關内。那時他還很得意的道：看你日本人兇罷，現在你可打不到我了。這種人，他的性命身家固然保全了，然而能不能說他的行動是反抗的行動？那當然不是，絶對不是！來信所說某君因不願受商店壓迫而辭職回里，其行動何以異此？所以我之所說的反抗，是要從實際行動上，集合同一利害同一階級的人，有組織的有鮮明的目標的向壓迫者進攻；其力量必須集中，其份子必須純粹，其組織必須嚴密而其行動又必須有一定的步騾，這樣才能收反抗之效，這樣才算得是反抗！若隨便逞一二人一時之意氣，瞎閙一下或是消極的退讓，如來信所說某君然，那不是反抗，簡直是兒戲！這是一。其次，在羣衆運動中發現反叛份子，那本是常有之事，尤其是小市民層，在整個社會革命中，他整個階級最富反叛性，到某一時期，這小市民層常常脫離革命羣衆去投到反革命障營中去，甚至將革命益利予以出售，歷史上舉不勝舉。這不是小市民層特别壞，而是他整個階級性命令他如此。整個小市民層的賦性旣然如此不堅定，要在這一階級裏面謀團結，自然很困難，而反叛份子也就所以特别多了。這實是無可奈何之事。然亦非全無辦法，只要看這一運動的領導者能力如何。如有有能力的領導者，加以嚴密組織，竭力排除遊離份子，用嚴萬的手段制裁反叛份子，也未始不可集中力量，爆發出一個偉大的革命運動。這是二。總之，羣衆運動不是輕而易舉之事，而是要經過相當艱苦的奮門才能得到相當結果的。中間的失敗，是萬萬不能避免，只有愈能經得失敗，力量便愈集中。若怕失敗，便請一切不要談起！</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（三十八）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>（二十一）我們總有報仇雪恨的一天李石喬昨晚快快回家之後，整個的長夜都在失眠的焦思中間過去。素來起身特别早的美子，天還剛發亮，便乘機推開他的門，目的祗在看看石喬昨夜回來沒有，現在正睡得怎樣，好像祗要看看他便能得到安慰似的。不料石喬並沒有睡覺，正光着眼看那漸漸透明的玻璃窗。美子走進去輕輕的問道：［醒來得這樣早麽？］石喬想坐起來抱住她，但是他忽然意識到自己旣然失歡於三姨太，難道要向純潔的美子來補賞，來發洩嗎，這簡直是侮辱了美子，因便裝出很淡漠的樣子回答美子道：［你早呀！］其實石喬的想抱住美子，確是一種眞摰情感的自然流露。過分的自省，疑慮，猶豫，反而常常蒙昩了他的眞實靈魂。這本可以說是一般的智識份子之劣根性，而石喬是更厲害地被這劣根性弄得一事無成。當美子看出他的淡漠悄然離去的時候，他又馬上後悔起來，惘然若有所失。漸漸由悔轉到恨，這恨，是恨荒蕩的三姨太，以至於王化矮子。接着一種淫汚的想像，關於三化和三姨太的一幕肉麻的幻像又绞纒着他的腦際，這幻像是痛苦了他整夜了的。這時候，看見了早晨的日光，好像日光更曝露了他的恥辱似的，心裏的痛苦因而更加深邃，兩手擎了拳頭，不自覺地坐了起來。忽然阿珍送杯茶進來。說道：</p>
<p>［我在下面灶間裏很早便聽見你房裏嚮動着了！我曉得你在起來了］。把茶杯擺在小圓臺上，接着說：</p>
<p>『這兩天家裏沒有一個人了啦：楊老爺忙着回來也不回來了，連太太昨夜也沒有回家睡。長發那東西，自從那天被老爺打了耳光，便自打起舗蓋走了。弄得祗有我一個人守這空屋子啦！』說完便歪着頭，歪頭差不多是她亞媚的習慣恣態。但終因石喬那死板的臉，毫無一絲笑意，便不得要領地走了。</p>
<p>等到石喬再抬頭一看，玻璃窗上已宣染着紅色的朝陽了。賣報的小孩子已在馬路上奔喊着了。</p>
<p>『阿要看到昨夜江灣大戰，阿要看到東洋人吃敗仗！』他聽到這種賣報的呌聲，好像猛的吃了一驚。戰爭，戰爭戰爭重新打進他的意識界，重新激起他的情緖。在忘記了戰爭似的後方，這後方的惡濁環境把他轉進了漩渦裏，也不自覺地消磨了戰爭的興奮，他在過着一種如何墮落的生活啊，如何與勇敢的前線不相稱的生活啊。他重新醒悟到自己的眞實的地位丨丨社會的責任，國民的義務。於是他决定設法到前線去，無論到前線犧牲的代價如何，就算到前線換換空氣也是好的，至少要可以洗去在後方沾染到的汚泥。於是打定了一個主意，用××××團體聯合會的名義備了一封公函·說是派自己爲代表去慰勞前線義勇軍將士。精神不覺一振，連忙穿好衣服，先到飯館用了早餐，隨即到十九路軍司令部，由部車送他到前方。</p>

<h3>中國電影的佈景問題</h3>
<p>— 蘼蕪</p>
<p>人類無論如何不能離開世界而獨立。那末，電影旣然是人的社會生活的反映，當然也不能離開世界。在銀幕上，表示這點的，就是佈景。在戲劇出演的舞台裝置上，佈景就佔絶重要的地位。不過無論如何，舞台劇的佈景，總是較象徵的。這自然是種種現實的困難，使他不能不如此。至於電影，那就絶不如此。他需要極大的眞實，通過了『電影的時間與空間』的眞實，同時籍着攝影的技術，使一切佈景都逼眞起來。但是中國電影，是不是做到這一點呢？回答是簡單的，絶對沒有。現在我們且把小公司的紙糊的房屋，和風吹壁動等笑話，不說，我們先檢查下所謂大公司的佈景。</p>
<p>第一，我認爲不滿意的，就是佈景的非現實，好像室内裝置，差不多都是除了佈景是不能看到的東西。在表示一個富豪的家中，這種窮奢極麗的裝置，還可以不幸的，凡是表示『從手到口』的『薪水階級』的家中，也是這樣新奇的一套，尤其才盾的，好像『蘭谷萍蹤』中，裝訂作的亭子間裏，竟和富室少爺的書屋同樣精致。實在說不過去。這樣的佈景，容易使觀象發生[不過是看戲，]的對於現實的幻滅的感覺。而喪失應有的效果。</p>
<p>第二就是不能和劇情統一起來，我們知道對於貧民窟，或則貧農家庭的表現，無非要觀衆進一步的具體了解貧民和貧農們的生活狀况。所以我們就應該儘量的把他們的蕭條，破敗，汚穢，零亂表現出來；使觀衆把這些和整個的劇情，劇中人的生活性格聯系起來。而形成統一的現實的印象，絶對不應該吟咏着自然的美麗，把貧民窟旁的一潭臭水，弄成繳波盪漾，更在水旁加一棵微笑的桃花。或則在破落的農邨中，加着幾隻肥鵝乳燕。這不是說貧民窟和破產的農村，不應該有這些東西，不過把這些東西放在被壓迫與被損害者的影片裏，是會和緩或則解消觀象的憤激的情緖的。况且客觀的存的，還會因爲主觀的情緖而異其美惡，電影旣是需要通過觀衆的眼光，製作者就應該想到這時候（看到這個故事的時候）觀衆的情緖是否再會賞玩自然的美麗！</p>
<p>以上是目前中國電影的佈景上的主要的缺點，此外則有些事實上不能弄好的佈景，我們的製作者就應該儘可能的避免。好像『火山情血』中，火山的一塲，明明知道這火山的佈景是一個笑話，那末聰明的導演，就不心要在銀幕上讓火山出現。就我們看來地主的兒子的死，假使是從山上失足跌下，那末，不但情節上一無妨碍。并且火山已爆發，而兩人還向火山上奔的無理由，以及墮入噴火口的凑巧，都可以避免可惜我們的導演徧徧不這樣做。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評『伉儷寳鑑』ＰｅｒｆｅｃｔＵｎｄｅｒｓｔａｄｉｎｇ</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>光陸丨花園開映</p>
<p>就整個的演出說，像這樣的導演手法，是不會使我們如何驚奇的。然而在其中也多少可以找出一些特點，譬如開始時寫男女主角在湖濱低唱情歌，那種羅曼斯的描寫，未始不是導演得意的手法，可是爲了這一戀歌不能很快的終止，而又不能運用一點如『桃花村』或學校愛生活』同樣的技巧，配合着更能適合歌詞的畫面，以致使人們感覺着這一塲面的過長，同時也不免難爲了史璜生的表演。又如女主角和那探險家在走廊上且談且走，而以其他夫妻間的不睦同時並進，以增進主角心情的變化，這一手法很是經濟。法庭的塲面，自然也是比較好的，尤其是在承法吏高喊『密斯脫尼克和密西斯尼克』的聲中，離婚夫婦承機遁去，的確是新頴有趣，助成了喜劇的收塲，但也是輕鬆可笑的了。至於賽船的一塲，固然很是熱鬧，和新聞片一樣，也許有不少人看得好高興，然而僅僅是這樣的一次生硬的穿挿，姑勿論他佔了極長的時間，終於不能調和全部的沉悶劇情，甚至於反使人發生不快之感。除此各點以外，其他都屬平庸，</p>
<p>和别的陳舊方法完全一致，不過是大同小異而已。</p>
<p>導演對於劇中人個性的處理，我以爲那一個探險家最不充分。固然約翰哈立台的陰陽怪氣的臉孔，和在『恐怖艇』中一樣，大可以顯出他的陰奸，可是他旣然對於女主人翁鍾情，爲什麽完全沒有一點熱情的表現？而且一個熱心科學的探險，爲什麽要如此的陰奸？</p>
<p>史璜生（ＧｌｏｒｉａＳｗａｎｓｏｎ）的聲名，在影迷的記憶中是永遠不會忘懷的吧。她有她的特長，在技藝上我們不能否認她的熟練。所謂『老牌風騷』的榮譽，也增加了她的號召力。但是可惜『駐顏術』並不是每個優伶都能得着其中奥妙，於是乎不能不使人們發生『春光老去』之感。曼麗畢克馥在『秘密』中失却了少女的靑春，同樣，史璜生也不能在化裝術中來挽回她美麗的容顏。然而這都是題外的閒話，主要的是她已經不適宜於少女的扮演，最明顯的在後叚就比前部來得自然。</p>
<p>『内容决定了形式，』這句話始終存在。一個無聊的戀愛糾紛，畢竟不能使演出得着天大的成功。假使我們一定要在糾紛中尋求說敎的意義，那末所謂結婚是戀愛的墳墓，或是夫婦間應當互相尊重對方的自由等，到底是不能離開經濟基礎而作欺人之解釋的。那末這一『伉儷寳鑑』當然也就不能使伉儷們得着何等裨益的了。</p>
<h3>評『古屋艶史』</h3>
<p>— 蘼蕪</p>
<p>在現代社會裏，除了出買肉體的娼妓外，以及貧苦的女人們，常常把自己的肉體當作資本而獲得少數費用以補勞動所得的不是之外，還有那有　的婦女們，瘋狂的追求着性愛的滿足。因此，皮映到電影中來了，性愛爲中心的影片，就層出不窮而『古屋艶史，』也是這樣的影片。</p>
<p>故事是一個浪漫的女子，憑藉着她的肉體誘惑玩弄了很多的男子，終於爲被玩弄過的男子謀殺了。而一羣同她亨樂的紳士，因爲同謀給偵探發覺而一齊下獄。</p>
<p>本來在歐美國家中，正式結婚已經逐漸减少了。這一點是證明了個人主義發達到絶端，已經冲破了旣成法律規定的一夫一妻的婚姻制度。而伍性浪漫，以及沒落期的『人生幾何』的頽廢的亨樂主義使他們一天一天的踏上自趨滅亡的路，而演着無意義的悲劇。『古屋艶史』除了說明以上的幾點外，還告訴我們些什麽呢？</p>
<p>不錯『内容的空虚，决定了形式的平凡』。而在『古屋艶史』的技術方面，我們是着到舊的電影藝術是已經爛熟，并且開始腐敗了。導演是竭力地想把結構弄得奇特，使這張影片帶上一些恐怖的情調。不過這一點是並沒有完全做到。加以故事的沒有更嚴肅更偉大的意義，不能使觀衆們把握着正確的意識，而只是使用着變化的鏡頭來眩觀衆的目光，他的失敗是必然的了。</p>
<p>演員方面女生角凱瑪蘭最佳，她絶稱職的把浪漫女子的神態表現出來。這或者正是所謂『自己暴露』的一例罷！李卡杜嘉載也很可以。</p>

<p>ＡｉｒＭａｉｌＭｖｓｔｅｒｙ以一個退職飛機師李博，與其友辛士共同開採『金星』金鑛，將所獲黃金，用飛機運往造幣廠去，而爲一個空中大盜名『黑鷹』者，駕一黑色飛機在空中行刦，前後共五次之多，使得畫面上的飛機有表演機會，而做成這所謂空中的奇觀。故事的内容，雖然，使人感到單調與平凡，可是畫面所給與觀衆們視覺上的滿足，却是實在的。</p>
<p>這就因爲是飛機在畫面上得到了很多的表演機會的關係，『空中奇觀』的作者能夠專力注意於飛機的描寫，實在是容易使這部片子討好觀衆的方法。</p>
<p>片中最緊張的一塲面，是空中飛機與飛機的對抗，地上汽車追汽車，放槍射擊，及馬追馬的對寫，導演者的細而有力的運用着活潑的鏡頭，使畫面上的情形達於最高點，使觀衆的感情陷於恐怖與驚惶之中。其次，如李博及其愛人瑪琍的兩次受傷，及被黑鷹捉去了的詹菲之脫身，助李博等與盜黨力鬥的塲面，也都頗爲可觀。這裏，我提前說一說，攝影技術帮助導演成功的地方是很不少的。</p>
<p>飛機的表演是這片子演出方面的唯一優點，所以每一個飛機表演的畫面，全是片中極重要的塲面。這裏，三隻飛機的飛行技術都很精明，危險性的，恐怖性的表演也有些，如李博飛機之墮水等。而在畫面上最爲漂亮的，是那幾次大盜的黑色飛機降落的幾個近攝鏡頭。同時，我們也可以看到一些有趣的穿挿，如辛士的舊汽車中途因汽缸太熟而停止等。</p>
<p>至於片子的意義，當然是在於提起觀衆的航空興趣了。故事所包含的那些不要怕困難，擊敗敵黨的英雄氣氛濃厚的說敎，而且是爲了金鑛，那是非常陳腐的，這和那些爲黃金美人而作的所謂</p>
<p>武俠片有些相同了。</p>
<h3>一對醜搭當</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>老明星曼麗特蘭漱是好蘭塢著名的老醜婦。她到了六十幾歲，居然做了好萊塢的電影皇后。她生平認爲第一個知已的，是華雷斯皮萊，他也是她萊塢男明星中最醜陋的一人。一個醜男，一個醜女，增加了影台上不少的笑料。現在米高梅公司爲完成他們二人的知己起見，特請他們合演一部影片呌做ＴｕｇｂｏｏｔＡｎｎｉｏｏ裏面沒有美麗的女子，也沒有具有男性典型的美男子。所有的是一對醜明星演成的一部醜貎的影片。好萊塢對於這部影片不知引起了幾多的笑談呢</p>
<h3>北京大戲院裝修停映</h3>
<p>本埠北京大戲院，近來對於國片方面，努力搜集，貢獻觀衆，現因天氣炎熱，溽暑困人，該院適値三年一刷之向例，故亦趁時暫停營業，俾得刷新内部，裝修一切，半月便可竣工，聞到時選映國產最新巨片，『母性之光』云。</p>
<h3>歐美攝影塲巡禮（九）</h3>
<p>— 雲巖</p>
<p>在三十四年前，他們就曾攝製影片，已經很奇怪了；但是還有更奇怪的，就是高蒙在三十年前，卽已攝製聲片。在一九○二年，他們攝製影片，並同時收取演員言語動作一致的留聲機片去配合它，他們呌這種法子是Ｃｈｕｏｎｏｐｈｏｎｅ這種片子，曾在倫敦等處放映過。一九一三年以前，高蒙一直在杜爾維希拍片。牧羊林的影場，到一九一四年方才完工，人家稱它是『玻璃影場。』但是到了一九二九年，有聲電影潮，震動了全世界的影業，内部的設備，又大加更換了。</p>
<p>高蒙富有進取心，到一九三二年的春天，在那『玻璃影場』的邊上，又有一座新的影場告成了。這是一座最大和最時代化的影能，屋頂距離地面，約高九十英尺。這裏有五座拍戲劇場，六百位男演員的化裝室和女明星的化裝室，都是非常舒適和完備的。此外還有三個私用的戲院；一間製曲室；九間藏片室；六百座位的飯館子；泥水木工塲和收音室等。他們在這攝影塲上面，差不多花了五十萬金鎊，但是現時還在那裏添設新的影場！</p>
<p>（十二）喬維爾（法國）Ｊｏｉｎｖｉｌｌｅ</p>
<p>丨派拉蒙法國影塲在巴黎左近喬維爾丨</p>
<p>在一大片鄕村中，那緩動的小溪，曲折流過那寂靜的牧塲，一陣陣的小牛，常在那裏吃草。靠近還有一道大河，美麗的畫舫，在來往駛行着。田間的喧閙聲，水上的欵乃聲，和影塲裏面的機聲併合着。那就是喬維爾的情景，派拉蒙的法國影場，就是建設在那裏的。　　在喬維爾地方，有着這天然的美景，所以拍戲時候，有時用不着再建設背景了。事實上確然太好了，有一天，他們需要一羣小羊，就强迫那牧塲上的小羊，做了臨時演員，在那地面上，有一處非常可愛的草土和許多美麗的古樹，充滿着舊世界的空氣。在攝影塲的門前。就是鐵路，從巴黎到那裏，半個鐘頭就到了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Six Weeks of Time Wasted: World Economic Conference Declares Adjournment</h3>
<p>The final plenary session passed a resolution allowing the executive branch to maintain a glimmer of hope. Representatives' farewell speeches were full of pessimistic tones. Five major silver-producing countries signed a supplementary silver agreement. (London) The Geological Museum, recently as quiet as a tomb, was again active this morning, bidding a final farewell to the historic World Economic Conference. Despite the scorching weather, there were still no empty seats in the audience. British Prime Minister MacDonald announced the opening of the meeting at 10:00 AM, expressing hope that everything could be completed by 5:30 PM, and stated that the speeches of the representatives would not be re-translated to save time.</p>
<h3>Bonnet Presents Financial Report</h3>
<p>Regrets the failure to reach an agreement. French Finance Minister Bonnet then presented his financial report, briefly outlining the difficulties of the Financial Committee, and said that although they had failed to reach a final agreement on all points this time, they had no doubt about the possibility of reconciling their views in the future.</p>
<h3>American Representative Cox Speaks</h3>
<p>Special Emphasis on International Debt. American representative Cox, in his capacity as Chairman of the Monetary Committee, said that the conference had indeed produced results worthy of the meeting. They all believed that if they did not continue to use the best efforts deployed by world civilization, it would become one of the most tragic events in human history. Speaking of debt, the Bank for International Settlements is a necessary tool to encourage construction efforts, and its importance cannot be ignored. If trade routes are blocked by bad debts, the general recovery of the world will never be possible.</p>
<h3>Lehmann Presents Economic Report</h3>
<p>States the Difficulties of Dealing with Conference Affairs. Lehmann, the rapporteur of the Economic Committee, then spoke, briefly describing his past experience in dealing with conference affairs. He said that his report neither ignored the difficulties nor exaggerated the progress. The delegates had already achieved useful research work, and progress in the area of production and sales should be noted. Several countries have already implemented measures to reduce trade barriers, although this is far less than what they had hoped for. The environment that the Economic Committee could not prevent has hindered their discussions in the early stages of the conference. The work that has now been accomplished will definitely be a valuable foundation for continued work after the adjournment. Lehmann then praised the chairmen of the committees, and especially praised Prime Minister Colijn, calling him a great chairman and a gentleman with great experience and courtesy. The audience applauded greatly upon hearing this.</p>
<h3>Colijn Delivers a Pessimistic Tone</h3>
<p>As if Dousing People with Cold Water</p>
<p>Colijn then rose to speak, his tone pessimistic, as if dousing people with cold water. He said that the conference had no reason to congratulate itself on its achievements, which was not only very disappointing, but also extremely dangerous, because unfulfilled hopes would turn into reaction, which would make the situation even more serious. Now, try to ask whether the conference has achieved any practical plans, and they think that none of the participants are prepared to give an affirmative answer. Several countries are waiting and seeing, hoping to avoid joining the reckless competition, raising tariffs, and issuing import quotas to strangle the necessity of world trade. However, even if the conference has not achieved concrete results, he is not overly pessimistic, such as the principles of commercial policy, and the countries have a greater and greater agreement on this.</p>
<h3>Italian Finance Minister Defends the Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Economic problems cannot be cured alone. Italian Finance Minister Jung then spoke, slightly optimistically, saying that there was an important record of achievements in the past week, making people hold the hope that international cooperation will eventually proceed. World economic problems cannot be cured alone. To give one example, tariff truce and currency stability are actually one problem. Managed currency is an inconceivable thing. Rich countries may try it, but knowledge makes Italy strictly adhere to the gold standard. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hymans Admits Conference Failure</h3>
<p>Without Currency Stability, Everything is in Vain. After Jung's speech, Belgian representative and Foreign Minister Hymans spoke. He also admitted that the results of the economic conference were not as they had hoped, and strongly argued that all economic recovery efforts depended on currency stability and the free use of the gold standard. Speaking of economic problems, Hymans believed that before exchange rates were free, measures to reduce tax rates, especially extending the tariff truce, were all in vain and useless. (27th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Currency Obstructs Tariff Discussions</h3>
<p>Chamberlain Secretly Blames the United States. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain spoke. Because the conference made very little progress, his words could not hide his disappointment. He said that many important and urgent issues were very related to the recovery of world prosperity. The conference only touched on its outlines. The situation in the United States does not allow people to attempt to stabilize exchange rates or restore international currency standards. The lack of resolution of this economic situation is indeed helpful, but they do not blame anyone, but only wait for a more appropriate time to work hard again. They do not underestimate the value of what has been achieved. Useful resolutions have been passed in the currency area, and there has been greater development in the economic area. However, discussions on tariffs and trade barriers have also been obstructed by the resistance to the progress of currency issues. The UK cannot accept the position of making the current tariff differences into rigid articles. The United States believes that countries with high tariffs should first reduce taxes. The UK welcomes this recognition. As for shipping subsidies, no resolution has been made, which he regrets. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Schacht Speaks. President of the German National Bank Schacht</h3>
<p>said that the conference has worked hard for more than six weeks, but almost none of the items on the agenda have reached an agreement, which is very regrettable. The final resolutions issued by the committees only express general opinions, and the memoranda they drafted are the same as those of every international conference since the 1920 Beijing Conference. One of the tasks of future international economic policy should be to equalize the living standards of countries with low living standards and advanced countries, so as to seek work and avoid unemployment. The German government is prepared to join international cooperation in the future.</p>
<h3>Czech Representative Speaks. Czech representative Masaryk speaks</h3>
<p>on behalf of the Little Entente countries, saying that the adjournment period should have sufficient opportunity to reconsider the overall situation. It is better to deal with the difficulties honestly than to make superficial agreements.</p>
<h3>Hull Urges Loudly. US Secretary of State Hull said</h3>
<p>that countries must have sufficient time to expand their economic plans, so that countries can cooperate in a gradually increasing level in accordance with the conference agenda. The danger of the most fanatical armaments in the past may not be greater than the competition between countries in preparing for economic warfare. The current economic war has already inflicted great damage on people everywhere. Countries must pursue non-extreme economic policies and abandon the artificial strategies of protecting inefficient industries. Countries should first have large-scale domestic procedures to deal with their commercial depression, but international cooperation is also necessary, so that a broad foundation can be established to build a sound domestic economic structure. Hull is not an orator, so his tone is weak. British Prime Minister MacDonald happened to be sitting behind him, guarding his ears with his hands, and listening attentively. As Hull was about to finish his speech, he raised his voice and said, "We don't want to stop, we have already started, and we will continue." This sentence was clear and heard by everyone in the audience.</p>
<h3>Reading the President's Letter. Hull then sent a</h3>
<p>personal letter from President Roosevelt to Chairman MacDonald, expressing sincere admiration for MacDonald's courage and patience as chairman of the conference, and said that the United States today understands the problems of other countries more clearly than before the conference was held. He hopes that other countries will view the United States' policies aimed at overcoming abnormal economic conditions with the same goodwill spirit. He does not think the conference has failed, because relying on the chairman's skills and perseverance, more important problems will continue to be discussed. Reorganization to adapt to the needs of unprecedented economic conditions is recognized by people. The chairman can rely on the United States' continued efforts for world recovery, because they firmly believe that the continuation of the World Economic Conference will definitely produce practically good results in many ways.</p>
<h3>Bonnet Continues to Speak. After Hull's speech, French Finance</h3>
<p>Minister Bonnet continued to speak, with bright eyes and lively gestures, supporting France's monetary policy, saying that the foundation for future agreements has now been laid. They do not have excessive optimism, but can hope that there will be concrete results soon, and the transformation of the world economy can be effectively facilitated. Bonnet also declared France's determination to maintain the gold standard, saying that fluctuations in exchange rates caused by speculation are enough to hinder labor and investment, and they cannot be restricted today, which they particularly regret. They firmly believe that there will eventually be a day when the environment will allow currency prices to stabilize. The reason why the conference cannot achieve far-reaching progress is actually because of the different financial and economic conditions of the countries. Bonnet said at the end that the French representatives do not think that economic nationalism is a good thing, and advocate that they can organize reasonable production based on the international monetary standard to remedy the low prices. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[P Russian Representative Ridicules Thoroughly. Soviet Russian representative Maisky</p>
<p>delivered a speech in a mocking tone, saying that the results of the conference were almost equal to zero, and predicted that its ending would regenerate [aggressive economic nationalism]. Recalling the past economic wars, which often caused gun wars, he warned the world that sparks can start a prairie fire, and small conflicts are often enough to cause the great disaster of armed warfare. Maisky also severely criticized the conference for failing to adopt the Soviet Russian proposal, saying that it was regarded as [an unwanted adopted child]. He also said that even the most beloved children in the conference, such as proposals to stabilize currency, raise prices, reduce tariffs, and develop public works, were all put into cold storage. Is it any wonder that the adopted child was abandoned? The only lesson of this conference is that the contradictions of the world capitalist system have continued to grow, to the point that it is no longer possible to make the Locarno Agreement. Therefore, after six weeks of discussion, there was nothing to be gained, so the initiator of this conference had to send its representatives back home. Since there was no resolution or decision on the date of the next meeting, it was dismissed. Therefore, the plenary session of his speech today may be the last handshake before the economic conference dies. (27th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Brazil Praises the Silver Agreement. Brazilian representative Olavo</h3>
<p>Bila spoke, saying that the success of the silver agreement is indeed commendable, and said that he intended to continue the work that had already begun. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Continued Meeting in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>(London) The conference reconvened at 3:00 PM. The first speaker was Haitian representative Cournisan, who advocated immediately starting the preparatory work for the next economic conference.</p>
<h3>Ishii Speaks</h3>
<p>Next, Japanese representative Kikujiro Ishii took the stage to speak, expressing Japan's sincere wish to do its best to help the final success of the economic conference, saying that there are two main principles of Japan's economic policy: (1) the absolute and unconditional adoption of the most-favored-nation clause; (2) the abolition of tariffs, or at least the reduction of tariffs. He then expressed his enthusiastic support for the recent official document from the US government to the conference, which advocated that the delegations continue to work on certain key points and maintain contact with each other at any time during the recess of the economic conference. (27th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Committee Reports Unanimously Passed. The conference</h3>
<p>then unanimously passed the reports of the main committee and the monetary and economic committees without voting. Thereupon, the chairman gave a twenty-minute closing speech, expressing deep regret for the failure of the meeting to complete its work and the need for a recess, and said that the gentlemen must not misunderstand, knowing that this recess is not a closure. The realization of their hopes is only postponed, and has not been in vain, because the very fact that the world has gathered here is enough to give them hope. (27th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Chairman's Final Speech</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald proposed several resolutions, which were passed without discussion, including a proposal allowing the executive branch to have the power to handle affairs during the recess, and the currency and economic reports. The British Prime Minister also expressed regret that the conference was forced to adjourn without completing its work, but said that there were things that could not be misunderstood. This was a temporary recess, not a result. The British Prime Minister also said that the hope created by the conference itself had contributed to the revival of world trade. The conference still had to remove obstacles in order to move towards prosperity and reduce the suffering they were currently encountering. They met here to disarm economically and restore the prosperity they had destroyed. He asked whether any of the representatives here were willing to stop their work or bear the responsibility of stopping the work of others. They started planning with sincerity, but when currency difficulties arose, the discussion of interim agreements or solutions could not proceed. The full cause of the conference could not continue. Although the committees continued to work as usual, a recess was inevitable. At this time, he dared to advise the representatives of the countries to faithfully report to their governments what they had seen and heard and experienced here, so that they could come again and make the conference a success. The fact that they discussed currency difficulties this time, which caused the originally promising conference to come to a standstill, has given them a valuable lesson, that is, certain international economic facts must be recognized before the results can be satisfactory. They must first know the truth about tariff limits, etc., before they can agree on a solution. This is one of the most important tasks during the recess. The British Prime Minister then spoke about the difficulty of establishing a unified plan to increase prices, but said that the discussion of this problem may promote large-scale international action and give the world general guidance. In the future, this policy can be implemented in a scientific way, which will have the benefit of increasing prices, in other words, encouraging consumers. Regarding the issue of international debt, unfortunately they have not yet been able to take any action on this matter. They must continue to deal with this matter. If creditor countries are not prepared to accept goods in exchange for debt payments, the debt cannot be paid off. At the same time, they must find a way to make the assets of countries hoarding gold circulate and replenish the reserves needed by countries with relatively insufficient assets to create their positions. The problem of supply and demand adaptation is also very potentially dangerous, but this is an event that can be resolved when representatives of producing countries and consuming countries gather together. Therefore, he hopes that the committees will soon re-engage in preparing concrete memoranda for consideration when the conference resumes. What is recorded in today's report is only the hard work of the committees for the past three weeks, and it makes people hope that when obstacles are eliminated in the future, valuable results can be obtained. If countries using gold, countries using pounds, and countries using yuan are willing to maintain their currencies and prohibit speculation, there is plenty of room for coordination between countries. As for the economic aspects, agreements are only a matter of time and research. What is needed now is nothing more than the close study of the various suggestions that have been put forward, and the power of diplomats to reconcile differences to create enforceable conclusions.</p>
<p>MacDonald then declared that their postponement was not due to failure or discouragement, but because the committees needed more time to continue their discussions. Therefore, the gentlemen will order the executive branch to remain active, and in order to make this activity more powerful, the executive branch will elect an executive committee, with one chairman's time, because the important part of the work is very complicated. Conflicting opinions and all suggestions must be studied. However, people all have the same idea, that is, the current situation, such as unemployment, bankruptcy, unbalanced budgets, undeveloped sources of profit, etc., must be solved by human intelligence and government ability. They cannot do what is impossible, but they deeply feel that there is a garden that has not yet been cultivated. He now bids farewell to the gentlemen, believing that he will welcome the gentlemen back here in a few months.</p>
<h3>Officially Declared Adjournment</h3>
<p>MacDonald's final speech lasted half an hour before it ended. After the speech, the audience applauded. Then US representative Cox proposed a resolution expressing gratitude to the British Emperor for holding the opening ceremony and to British Prime Minister MacDonald for his painstaking guidance of the conference's work. Cox also moved to thank the British government, etc., for the hospitality of the delegations from various countries. Italian representative Jung rose to support it, and the French representative also expressed his enthusiastic support for the motion. Thereupon, all the representatives stood up together to show their agreement. Then MacDonald and Chamberlain successively delivered speeches of thanks. At this point, the British Prime Minister struck the table with a mallet and announced the end of the conference. The clock was 4:38 PM when the conference adjourned. (27th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Essence of Social Education by Lin</h3>
<p>[Social Education]: This term has been familiar for over a decade. Many domestic educators are engaged in the research and implementation of this field. However, discussing education in today's economic and political climate is already extremely difficult. Discussing social education today is even more so. Nevertheless, great undertakings that are urgently needed by humanity generally regard the ordinary as difficult. Precisely because it is difficult, the efforts for its research and implementation cannot be relaxed for even a moment. But what kind of education, in the end, is social education?</p>
<p>Some say that social education stands alongside family education and school education. When a person is born, in their infancy, they regard the family as their world and their parents as their support. Interacting with siblings, everything taught by parents, instructed by older siblings, and played with younger siblings, as well as what is learned and seen within this scope, is all family education. When they are old enough to attend school, from elementary to middle to university, all the education received during this period, including the teachings of teachers, the mutual learning with classmates, and all the facilities of the school, which can directly or indirectly enlighten or influence students, is all school education. However, our simple family life is very brief. As for schools, even in the most developed European and American countries, the number of school-age children and educated youth they accommodate is vastly different compared to those who do not attend school. Even if all children and youth receive adequate school education, the years spent in school are only a small part of life compared to the years after leaving school and entering society. After entering the world, society must have various functions that contain and cultivate human virtues, preserve the culture and experiences of human history, and assist youth in advancing in virtue and learning. These various functions are all social education.</p>
<p>Some say that humans are inherently social animals. When they are conceived in the womb, they already inherit the physiological, psychological, historical, and social inheritance interwoven from countless millennia of their ancestors' lives, which is deeply related to human society. When they are born, they are assisted by a midwife. Besides parents, siblings, there is a wet nurse to feed them and a nanny to care for them. Their social relations become increasingly complex. All the influences that such relationships give to children are social education. When they enter school and learn from teachers, not only are school teachers and classmates, as well as all the facilities of the school, sufficient to influence children and youth, but also in the process from home to school and from school to home, there is an extremely large, boundless school. This school has no fixed classrooms. Teahouses, taverns, theaters, and cinemas are all classrooms. It has no fixed teachers, but the bustling, shoulder-to-shoulder crowds are all teachers. It has no fixed subjects, but all kinds of things, in all shapes and colors, constantly stimulate people and arouse their perceptions. As the saying goes, "One who stays near vermilion gets stained red, one who stays near ink gets stained black," "When living in Chu, one speaks like Chu; when living in Qi, one speaks like Qi; when living in Yue, one speaks like Yue." This is social education.</p>
<p>Some say that "social education" is opposed to individualistic education. Individualistic education takes the individual as the object and focuses on the education of a few talented people, while social education focuses on popularizing education among the general youth and children. Individual education cultivates the individual's independent and self-sufficient nature, while social education cultivates the habits of communal living and operation. This is what European and American educators call "communal society." The three statements above each have their merits. However, judging from the evolution of the times and the needs of society, the third statement is the most convincing. But there is also a difference between idealism and materialism. Idealists take the development of common social morality, the so-called "education of essential will," as the starting point, that is, first train the common will of mankind to achieve the goal of social education. Then social education is based on the education of human will. In other words, society is generated by human will. Materialists, on the other hand, argue that common labor is the starting point for forming a common society. In other words, the material life of common labor is the foundation for generating common will and common society. Only then can social education be spoken of. Some may say that American pragmatist educators advocate that life is education and education is life. Using this as an example, they are somewhat similar. But in fact, pragmatist education, viewed from its overall essence, is also a kind of social education. However, their social education is a social education adapted to the capitalist society for its commodity production, commodity circulation, that is, the production of surplus value. The social education of materialists takes the direct producers as the main body and adapts to the social survival and development of this main body. This is the social and cultural education of the main body.</p>
<p>In terms of the political and economic situation of our country today, such education is still difficult to realize at present. But as we have said before, "Great undertakings that are urgently needed by humanity generally regard the ordinary as difficult. Precisely because it is difficult, the efforts for its research and implementation cannot be relaxed for even a moment." Then we can only overcome difficulties and strive to achieve its realization. How to strive for realization? One is to focus on the improvement of the social system. The second is to focus on the cultivation of the consciousness of communal life. Following this path, there is hope for development.</p>
<h3>### Another Japanese Aggressor General Dies: Muto Dies of Illness in Changchun Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese warlord promotes Hishikari to succeed as puppet ambassador (Changchun) Marshal Muto passed away at 7:45 this morning. Earlier, the Japanese Emperor received the news that Marshal Muto was suffering from severe cholecystitis and sent a telegram of condolence at 10:00 p.m. on the 26th. The telegram was delivered to Ambassador Muto by Ichikawa Kaoru, the head of the Changchun Post Office. Marshal Muto received it in his sickbed.

<p>(Tokyo) After General Muto assumed the posts of Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchuria, Commander of the Kwantung Army, and Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory in August of last year, he was listed in the Marshal's Office. Less than a year later, the news of his death was suddenly heard. Muto was the most senior army general after the late General Shirakawa. Most of the current leaders of the Army Ministry, including Army Minister Araki, were Muto's subordinates. Muto was a man of deep and fierce bravery. His family includes his wife, Noko, and two daughters. At a time when Japan was facing many internal and external affairs, Muto was in charge of unifying the political organs of Manchuria and shouldering important responsibilities for the Empire. The sudden loss of Muto is a great loss to the Japanese nation. (Telegraphic dispatch from Japan Associated Press on the 27th)</p>
<h3>### Hishikari Succeeds</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government decided to appoint General Hishikari Takashi, a military councilor, as Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchuria. Hishikari Takashi is from Kagoshima Prefecture.

General Hishikari is scheduled to hold a confirmation ceremony at the Hayama Imperial Villa at 8:30 a.m. on the 28th. (Telegraphic dispatch from Japan Associated Press on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The residence of General Hishikari in Aoyama Takagicho, Akasaka Ward, Tokyo, was crowded with congratulatory visitors this afternoon, and the entrance to the reception room was in chaos. General Hishikari said, "This is not the time to talk about aspirations." When I was the commander of the Taiwan Army, I received congratulatory telegrams from all sides when I went to Taiwan, saying "I am happily and joyfully taking office," and when I sent a reply, I was nicknamed "Joyful and Joyful General." This is not something a sparrow can do, I think it is a falcon or an eagle, he said. (Telegraphic dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government was shocked to receive the news of General Muto's death. After consulting with the military and the prime minister, it was decided to recommend General Hishikari, a military councilor, to succeed as Commander of the Kwantung Army, Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchuria, and Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory. Although General Hishikari belongs to the middle faction, judging from past history, he is closer to the Ugaki faction. (Telegraphic dispatch from the China United Press on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Araki used Muto as a puppet to create the so-called Muto-Araki faction. The death of General Muto is a great loss to the Araki faction. It was originally intended to make Araki the successor prime minister to confront the Ugaki faction. The Ugaki faction therefore has a slight advantage. (Telegraphic dispatch from the China United Press on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the death of Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchuria Marshal Muto, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately held a meeting of its leaders. Foreign Minister Uchida, Vice-Minister Shigemitsu, and other key figures attended. They discussed the future policy towards Manchuria for a long time. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided that since the appointment of Muto as Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchuria was decided after consultation with the military, the affairs will continue to be carried out in accordance with the following established policy. Although [Manchukuo] has passed the founding era and the internal security is gradually recovering, the political situation in the neighboring areas is not optimistic. Japan's policy towards Manchuria will still be to have a powerful Plenipotentiary Ambassador lead all aspects of the civil and military affairs. Therefore, it is planned to appoint a military officer as the Ambassador to Manchuria, concurrently serving as the Commander of the Kwantung Army and the Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, continuing the system of three positions in one, and implementing Japan's own independent policy towards [Manchukuo].

<h3>### Muto's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Marshal Muto Nobuyoshi, Commander of the Kwantung Army, Plenipotentiary Ambassador, and Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, passed away at the Ambassador's residence at 7:00 this morning. His brief biography is as follows: The Marshal was born in 1868 in Saga Prefecture. He aspired to join the army and was appointed as a second lieutenant of infantry in 1893. He was promoted successively to the rank of Army General in 1926. In 1933, he was granted the title of Marshal and listed in the Marshal's Office, the highest honor for soldiers. He served as a staff officer in the General Staff Headquarters, a member of the same department, an instructor at the Army University, a staff officer of the Konoe Division, a military attaché in Russia, the commander of the 4th Infantry Regiment, the commander of the 23rd Infantry Brigade, the first director of the General Staff Headquarters, the director-general, the commander of the 3rd Division, the vice chief of staff, the director-general of education, etc. He succeeded General Honjo as the commander of the Kwantung Army, the first Plenipotentiary Ambassador to Manchuria, and the Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, overseeing all military and political powers until his death. He was 66 years old. (Telegraphic dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Marshal Muto Nobuyoshi, Commander of the Kwantung Army, who passed away today, was a man of few words and action. Not only junior soldiers, but also the general public admired him. As for the Marshal's anecdotes, the most famous one is that he was long praised as the "General of Few Words." When sitting opposite a guest, he would not say a word even for three hours. He was truly a man of few words. When asked by the guest, "Why don't you speak?" he would say, "There is nothing to say." It is also famous that his joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness were not shown on his face. Even his adjutant, Chiba, who had been by the Marshal's side for a long time, said that he had never seen the Marshal's emotions. There is also the so-called Muto sect within the army, which is not known when it started. This is not a faction, but a combination of people who admire the Marshal's personality and promote his spirit. However, the Marshal did not care about it and paid little attention to it.

<h3>### West Africa Rejects Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the report of Ambassador Matsudaira to the United Kingdom, Foreign Minister Simon of the United Kingdom intends to order British West Africa to withdraw from the area of application of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and impose high tariffs on Japanese exports. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Ambassador Matsudaira to request the British government to consider this. On the 25th, Foreign Minister Simon replied to Ambassador Matsudaira that the British government had no room for reconsideration on this issue and sternly rejected the call for attention from Japan.

Undersecretary of State Eden replied that Foreign Minister Simon felt that Britain did not need to adopt the above recommendations and could still have a satisfactory representative.

<h3>### Soviet Russian Commissioner of Commerce</h3>
<h3>### Plans to Establish a Trade Company</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It is said that Soviet Russian Commissioner of Commerce Komarov plans to establish a Sino-Soviet trade company in Tianjin, jointly funded by China and Russia, with a capital of 8 million yuan. The Ministry of Industry is still studying the mode of trade with Russia. Whether it will be government-operated, privately-operated, or government-supervised and privately-operated is still under discussion. Before a formal Sino-Russian commercial treaty is signed, the nature of organizing a large-scale trade company between the two countries needs to be carefully considered. Because the Soviet Union does not have regulations allowing people to invest in business, if Chinese merchants cooperate with them, major disputes will inevitably arise in the future when collecting debts. It is found that many Chinese merchants transported goods to Russia in good faith the year before last, but the Soviet government did not acknowledge the repayment and said that the Soviet Union does not allow people to do business, and the Chinese merchants suffered heavy losses, which have not yet been forgotten.

<h3>Five Silver-Producing Countries Sign Supplementary Silver Agreement</h3>
<p>Regulations Stipulate the Quantity of Silver to Be Purchased (London) The last agreement of the World Economic Conference's silver agreement was also signed tonight. This is an agreement reached by the five major silver-producing countries to purchase silver annually in addition to the amount of silver purchased under the nine-nation agreement. Mexico, Peru, and Canada had previously signed, and Australia and the United States also signed tonight, so that the silver agreement can be fully realized. As for the annual purchase amounts agreed upon by each country, although the representatives wanted to keep it secret pending approval by their respective governments, it has been leaked. It is said that the total amount of additional silver to be purchased annually by the five silver-producing countries will be equal to the total amount of silver purchased by the silver-producing countries under the nine-nation agreement, which is 35 million ounces per year. Among them, the United States will purchase an additional 24,421,410 ounces, Mexico 7,159,108 ounces, Canada 1,671,802 ounces, Peru 1,095,325 ounces, and Australia 652,355 ounces. According to these two agreements, the purchased silver cannot be circulated in the market. The nine-nation agreement stipulates that this silver should be stored in the national treasury. Therefore, according to the entire plan, 70 million ounces of silver will be withdrawn from the market each year. This amount is not very large in order to avoid shaking the stability of the currency and to take into account the government's purchasing power. However, according to the opinions of the general silver faction, the result should be beneficial to the price of silver, but it is not enough to raise it to the level expected by the silver producers. In addition, the Silver Subcommittee passed a third resolution, stipulating that silver-producing and silver-storing countries should take any feasible steps, depending on their domestic financial and monetary situation, to promote the use of silver and increase its price. This resolution is only a statement of principle and does not specify the amount. (Telegraphic dispatch from the National News Agency on the 26th)</p>

<p>League of Nations Technical Assistance to China</p>
<h3>### Japan Deliberately Destroys</h3>
<p>Leith-Ross's Activities Do Not Involve Politics The League of Nations Ignores Japanese Protests (Tokyo) The Japanese government has expressed its opposition to Song Ziwen's activities in Europe and the policies of various countries to assist China. However, this time, as a result of Song Ziwen's secret activities, the League of Nations decided to send a committee for cooperation with China to China. Japan believes that the members of the committee will inevitably assist China politically and issued a serious warning to the new Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Apuno. That is, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in view of the state of Leith-Ross's activities in China so far, requested the League of Nations to stop sending Leith-Ross to China. However, according to the recent reply from the League of Nations to Japan, the League of Nations has precedents for the Committee for Cooperation with China, and its activities are limited to the technical scope, so there is no reason for the Japanese government to protest. The League of Nations will advise Leith-Ross that its activities should not involve political issues, but the Japanese government has no right to interfere in this issue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the attitude of the League of Nations is lacking in sincerity, and in view of the close relationship between Japan and China, it will decide to prevent the League of Nations from cooperating with China. (Telegraphic dispatch from Japan Associated Press on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the League of Nations' technical assistance to China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is a political anti-Japanese movement by anti-Japanese elements within the League of Nations and Song Ziwen's cooperation. The Japanese government telegraphed Ito Nobushi, the acting director of the Imperial Affairs Bureau, to express the Japanese government's attitude towards the League of Nations' assistance to China to Secretary-General Apulo of the League of Nations. Secretary-General Apulo replied that this resolution was purely technical assistance to China and had no political significance. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that if Song Ziwen uses Japan's isolated international situation to engage in anti-Japanese actions in the name of technical assistance and strives to establish political and military loans, especially according to the resolution, Dr. Leith-Ross, who is sent to China, is a famous anti-Japanese figure. Their actions exceed the scope prescribed by the committee and develop into political maneuvering, which is fully possible. Japan will seek reflection on this kind of action by China and prepare to take appropriate measures depending on the development of the situation. (1) It is clear that the League of Nations' assistance to China cannot be political assistance according to the statement issued by the committee. (2) However, Song Ziwen, who has made great efforts to pass the bill, aims to engage in anti-Japanese activities in Europe and the United States and strives to establish political and military loans. In particular, according to the resolution, Dr. Leith-Ross, who is sent to China, is a famous anti-Japanese figure. Their actions exceed the scope prescribed by the committee and develop into political maneuvering, which is fully possible. (3) Japan will seek reflection on this kind of action by China and prepare to take appropriate measures depending on the development of the situation. (Telegraphic dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>### US Army and Navy Chiefs Express Armed Guarantee of Peace</h3>
<p>Military Effectiveness Cannot Be Weakened Again The Shipbuilding Program Is Scheduled to Be Completed Within Three Years (Washington) US Army Chief of Staff Dunne stated today that being prepared at all times and having appropriate defense is the greatest guarantee of peace. The United States has followed this policy for a long time, and it will not change under President Roosevelt. He also said that the number of soldiers and officers will not be reduced again, because if further cuts are made, the country's security and the army's effectiveness will be endangered. Therefore, we must not allow it to be reduced again, and we are now working to create a suitable force, believing that this is the greatest guarantee of peace. At present, some parts of the army in China are over-expanded and uneven, but they have not been weakened. At the same time, Navy Chief Swanson also said that the Navy's shipbuilding program will still be completed within three years. Although the docks will reduce weekly working hours, the government will strictly order to increase the employment of personnel. The bids for the warships ordered by the US government from private shipyards will be opened today, and the industry rules submitted by the shipbuilding industry have also been approved and signed by the US President today. It stipulates that the ships built by the government will work 32 hours per week. The bids submitted by the shipbuilding industry have not been announced today and are generally satisfactory. It is found that the US government will start building a total of 37 warships, and the funds for 32 of them are allocated from the public construction funds for relief of unemployment. A total of 21 ships were bid for this time, of which 17 were built with public construction funds. (Telegraphic dispatch from the National News Agency on the 27th)</p>

<h3>American Warships Visiting Southern China Provokes Japanese Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Fabricated and Absurd Rumors in Japanese Dispatches (Tokyo) According to information received by the military, Fujian Province in China concluded a treaty with Japan in Meiji 31 (1898) stipulating that land, ports, etc. within the province should not be leased to other parties, and pledging not to import foreign capital or expand military preparations. However, the American policy toward South China has become increasingly blatant recently. The American warship Fulton has actually landed machine guns and aircraft accessories in Xiamen. Furthermore, a plan to build a 123-kilometer railway between Zhangzhou and Longyan is soliciting general corporate bonds worth 10 million yuan and providing substantial assistance. Additionally, two submarines, six aircraft, six anti-aircraft guns, and 5,000 rounds of ammunition will be delivered to the Fujian Navy within the year. In return, the United States plans to secure the right to establish a U.S. naval base and coal storage facility in Dongshan Bay. The Japanese naval authorities are paying close attention to such American ambitions and Fujian Province's violation of the treaty. (Dentsu dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>The Unjust Death of Inukai Tsuyoshi</h3>
<p>Japanese Army and Navy Assassins Claim to be Victims of the Ruling Class, But Still Pray for His Happiness Dentsu, Yokosuka, 27th The public trial by naval court-martial of the May 15th Incident continued this morning at 9:00 AM. Lieutenant Commander Koga stated that weak diplomacy hinders the establishment of Pan-Asianism and the friendship between China and Japan. Therefore, before undertaking reforms in China, the prerequisite was to reform Japan's political parties. As for the attack on the Prime Minister's residence, Lieutenant Commander Mikami had suggested that intimidation by bombing would suffice. However, due to internal disagreements, the assassination of former Prime Minister Inukai occurred. The court adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 27th The public trial of the army side of the May 15th Incident opened this morning at 8:00 AM. The trial of Shinoshi Shihara was held. First, legal officer Shimada questioned the reasons for the reform movement. Shihara replied that, while at the Army War College, he was deeply impressed by the College's final admonition to uphold the national polity. The corruption within the country was all due to party politics, and the regulation that the Minister of the Army should be a reserve officer was a mistake. He also mentioned the London Treaty and criticized General Zaibu. Furthermore, he said that although Inukai Tsuyoshi was a clean and noble politician, he was a victim of the ruling class because he stood as a spokesman for political parties, but we sincerely prayed for his happiness. At 9:28 AM, there was a recess. At 10:05 AM, the trial resumed. Regarding the legal officer's question about the motives for direct action, he replied that the ultimate goal was to proclaim the Imperial Way, and the direct goal was to sound a warning to the nation. He also recounted the circumstances of the assassination of former Prime Minister Inukai. The courtroom was silent. At 11:00 AM, there was another recess. At 12:14 PM, the trial resumed, turning to questioning Tadaaki Nakajima. Nakajima explained to the legal officer the reasons for failing to take direct action. The court adjourned at 1:37 PM.</p>
<p>Hualian, Tokyo, 27th The army continued the military court-martial of the army assassins at 7:57 this morning. Prince Asaka of the Japanese Imperial Family also attended the court as an observer. According to army authorities, this is an unprecedented event. Shinnosuke Shihara answered the questions of the head judge, stating that his motive for participating in the May 15th Incident was because he believed that one ruler should govern Japan for the sake of all people, and he offered this loyalty to the Emperor as a guiding principle for his actions. At the same time, he hated the tyranny of the white race and wanted to control it to seek equality between Eastern and Western nations. He had also heard and seen that the corruption of the ruling class within the country had reached its limit and could not be reformed without fundamental changes. Therefore, he participated in this movement. He observed that domestic politics and diplomacy lacked a concept of the national polity. Russia was rampant in Manchuria, and Britain extended its reach into Asia, but these could not be resolutely stopped. Diplomats lacked backbone. Manchuria's change gave a major test to our diplomatic community. The policy towards China must first overthrow the Chinese Leninists in order to achieve Sino-Japanese friendship. In short, diplomacy must have autonomy. At that time, the domestic situation was also very pressing. If this continued, peasant uprisings would inevitably occur everywhere. If remedies were not made early, the army would have to be mobilized to suppress the uprisings. The villagers were the parents, brothers, and sisters of our soldiers; how could we point guns at our compatriots? To awaken the government and society, comrades rose up to eliminate the source of the disaster for our compatriots. As for the reason for taking direct action, it was because the poison of the ruling class was so rampant that it was difficult to correct it by legal means. When we reached the Prime Minister's residence, the police wanted to stop our actions, so we told them that the army had been mobilized, three battalions had surrounded the residence, and machine gun teams would arrive soon, and street battles were inevitable. The police were frightened, their faces ashen, and they quietly walked away. My state of mind remains unchanged, and I only hope to receive the extreme penalty to thank the Emperor. Afterwards, Nakajima continued to answer the judge's questions. His account was similar to that of Shihara and Goto, saying that he was influenced by Inoue Nissho, Camp Commander Hihara, and the theory of military national ruin, and thus embarked on this path. The purpose of direct action was to awaken the corrupt ruling class.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Political Situation Becomes Increasingly Precarious</h3>
<p>Military Opposes Minister of Interior, Fascist Party Also Opposes Government, Prime Minister Spends Night in Machine Gun Regiment Headquarters Reuters, Madrid, 27th News censorship is extremely strict in Lisbon, but according to news from that area, Portugal may soon experience a revolution. Portugal has been a monarchy and an independent country for six hundred years. It only changed its form of government to a republic in 1910. However, after the reform of the political system, coups d'état have occurred frequently in the Portuguese government, and various parties have relied on force to reorganize the government at any time. Currently, five regiments stationed in Lisbon and the garrison in Oberdor have openly expressed opposition to the appointment of Gomez as Minister of the Interior. It is now believed that if the Portuguese government does not withdraw this appointment, the Portuguese government may be overthrown. In addition, members of the Portuguese Fascist Party are now expressing sympathy for the opposition military. The Fascist Party has considerable influence, so their expressions are making the situation increasingly precarious. To prevent unforeseen circumstances, the government has ordered other troops to be stationed in strategic locations in the city, and the police have also been ordered to concentrate to supplement the army's shortcomings. Therefore, the atmosphere in the city is extremely tense. The President and all cabinet members are taking strict precautions to prevent assassination. At the same time, the Presidential Palace and other government agencies are heavily guarded by the military and police. Prime Minister Salazar is an even more notable figure. He is following the advice of his subordinates and spending the night in the headquarters of the First Machine Gun Regiment or moving his headquarters into it until the situation is settled. From the government's perspective, the currently good phenomenon is that the National Guard can still sincerely support the government.</p>

<h3>France to Hold Large-Scale Military Night Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Guomin, Paris, 26th In the first half of August, large-scale aerial night maneuvers will be held near Metz. Bombing and pursuit aircraft squadrons from Nancy and other places will participate. The purpose of this is to test the efficiency of specially built pursuit aircraft. It is said that this aircraft can prevent enemy night air raids from being effective.</p>
<h3>Impact of Italian Air Squadron on the US and Japan</h3>
<p>Promoting the Realization of the US Aviation Plan Guomin, Harbor Grace (Newfoundland), 26th The Italian air squadron safely arrived here at 12:53 PM today. Only one aircraft was forced to land at Cape Travers due to a problem with the water pump. It is currently being repaired and will fly here shortly. It is reported that the entire squadron may stay here for four or five days to inspect the engines and wait for good weather before crossing the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th Pacific problem expert Duboisque published an essay in the Times entitled [Problems Other than Economic Relations Between Japan and the United States]. He said that the voyage of the Italian Aviation Minister General Balbo leading a seaplane squadron across the ocean will have a huge impact on the spirit of both Japan and the United States. Japan and the United States regard this type of flight as more novel than Europe because European countries are intertwined, and the path from one country to another is easy. The two major Pacific powers believe that they are far apart and also far from Europe, and they believe that their security is reliable. After the Italian air squadron flew across the ocean, this belief will become a bubble. New York is more stimulated than Tokyo because Japan always takes precautions and considers all events in advance, so it will not be alarmed. Among the countries in the world, apart from today's Italy, Japan has the most far-reaching plans. As for the United States, it is different. For all events, it relies on its belief in calmness to respond. It will not cooperate internationally until it is unavoidable. Recently, the United States, in view of the threat from Japan, began to rush to build warships, which resulted in hasty work. Its shortcomings are well known. The same is true this year. The Italian air squadron's visit to the United States should promote the realization of the US aviation plan, and we hope that it will proceed smoothly and better than the navy.</p>
<h3>World's Largest Dock</h3>
<p>Named the King George V Graving Dock, Queen Mary Performs Christening Ceremony Reuters, Southampton, 26th The King and Queen, accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of York, departed from Cowes today aboard the royal yacht Victoria and Albert to attend the opening ceremony of the world's largest dock.

When the yacht arrived, the crowd cheered thunderously, and the sound of the orchestra's music was drowned out. Multiple aircraft soared in the sky, adding to the grandeur of the spectacle. Among the spectators were a thousand schoolchildren, filling the deck of the magnificent mail ship Queen Mary. The King named the dock the King George V Graving Dock and delivered a speech on its importance. After the speech, the Queen performed the christening ceremony. The dock is 1,200 feet long.</p>

Fengtian Garrison Commander Yu Zhishan, Jilin Xi Qia, Heilongjiang Zhao Wen,... cooperate with the Kwantung Army to share the garrison duties in each district. According to the latest organization, the standing military strength is 108,264 troops: Fengtian has six mixed brigades, two cavalry brigades, and one training detachment; Jilin has seven infantry brigades, four cavalry brigades, and two training detachments; Heilongjiang has five mixed brigades, three cavalry brigades, and one training detachment; Xing'an Southern Province has three cavalry brigades. The organization of the various provinces in the Northeast is currently underway. Rehe, due to the aftermath of the war, is still being reorganized and currently has 16,000 troops and 6,000 military police stationed there. The backbone of these armies, the lower-ranking officers, will be trained at the Army Central Training Institute to be established in Fengtian, jointly formed by the Japanese Infantry School and the Officer Academy. The first class of students will be mainly composed of 200 Japanese officers and has already been assigned to various units. The second class will select Manchurian officers for training. The third class will follow the Japanese Officer Academy system, selecting high school graduates from each province for admission. Currently, Zhang Jinghui and the Japanese military affairs advisors, such as Tada Sasaki, and other leaders are planning to control the military plans.</p>

<h3>The Great Academic Exploration of Manchuria and Mongolia (1) Translated from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun</h3>
<p>After Japan organized a large-scale industrial investigation and research group for Manchuria and Mongolia, news agencies across the country competed to secure special correspondence agreements with the group. Subsequently, the Asahi Shimbun obtained permission from the military, and the reporting rights for the group's findings were exclusively granted to the Asahi Shimbun. This led to widespread opposition from the media, who argued that such a large-scale undertaking should not be monopolized by a single organization. The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo was particularly vocal in its opposition. However, the outcome was that public permission was not granted. Now, the group has departed for the Northeast to conduct on-site investigations. The Osaka Asahi Shimbun has published a special issue on the great academic exploration of Manchuria and Mongolia. The reporter believes that this type of scholarly investigation and research material has significant value and has translated the summary for the reference of those who are interested in the Northeast and our country's culture.</p>
<h3>(1) Investigation and Research Guidelines</h3>
<p>This time, the Manchuria-Mongolia Academic Survey and Research Team is taking a scientific knife (Messer) to Manchuria and Mongolia, undertaking a general anatomical mission. It departed from Tokyo at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, and on the 24th, it left Japan on the Hong Kong Maru from Kobe. The team is led by Dr. Shigetaka Tokunaga, who holds a doctorate in engineering, and is comprised of national academic authorities in animal, plant, human, geological, stratigraphic, rock, and mineral sciences. It is both in name and reality an unprecedented academic exploration. The construction of a country's culture is based on the results of scientific investigation and research. Therefore, the dispatch of this team is greatly related to the future development of Manchuria and Mongolia. The humanities and geography of Manchuria and Mongolia have close ties with Japanese culture in terms of archeology. However, to this day, due to the lack of scientific understanding, many problems cannot be resolved. In particular, the Rehe and Hinggan Mountains' Yin Mountains, which occupy part of the Gobi Desert, are called the East Mongolian region and have long been a secret academic frontier. Therefore, scientific investigation and research in this region will contribute to the culture of [Manchukuo], and we can obtain valuable data. At the same time, the success of this exploration in this academic blank area in the Far East will surely shock the world. Therefore, the team's academic mission is expected to build a magnificent pyramid in human cultural history. This newspaper (Asahi Shimbun) has specially dispatched Fujiki and Shimada to participate in the team. Exploration reports and various photographs will be provided to readers in detail. The purpose of this survey is pure academic research and the investigation of various industrial foundations. The survey schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Arrive in Dalian on the 27th, visit Lushun and Fengtian, and depart for Changchun on the 31st. On August 3rd, depart from Changchun via Jinzhou for Beipiao. The first step of the exploration survey will begin on August 5th, between Beipiao and Chaoyang (stay for six days).</p>
<p>August 11th: Between Chaoyang and Lingyuan (same as above)</p>
<p>August 25th: Between Chengde and Gubeikou (stay for seven days)</p>
<p>September 1st: Chengde to Fengning (stay for six days)</p>
<p>September 7th: Fengning to Chengde (stay for two days)</p>
<p>September 9th: Chengde to Longhua (stay for seven days)</p>
<p>September 16th: Longhua to Weichang (stay for eight days)</p>
<p>September 24th: Weichang to Chifeng (stay for eight days)</p>
<p>October 2nd: Chifeng to Wudancheng (stay for five days)</p>
<p>October 7th: Wudancheng to Chifeng (stay for two days)</p>
<p>October 9th: Chifeng to Jianping (stay for seven days)</p>
<p>October 16th: Jianping to Chaoyang (stay for one day)</p>
<p>October 17th: Chaoyang to Changchun (stay for three days)</p>
<p>October 20th: Disband in Changchun.</p>
<p>During the stay, each department will conduct separate investigations along the way and study nearby mountains, forests, lakes, and swamps. If in a desert area, they will camp in the wilderness, but they will establish a base to radiate out. Rehe Province was originally the land of the ancient Donghu people, and the cultural construction of the Liao and Jin Dynasties was quite significant. Subsequently, it declined and gradually became the desolate area of Rehe. However, this area is still unexplored from the academic perspective of animals, plants, geology, archeology, etc. Therefore, specialized scholars are always eager to explore it. Among the animals, wolves, bears, antelopes, wild sheep, raccoon dogs, hamsters, etc. can be found. Among the birds, cranes, geese, ducks, etc. fly in flocks across the sky. In the Meng Huai grassland, there are wild turkeys. Other strange and rare animals, such as snakes and lizards, are countless. Among the plants, the most peculiar is the [original species of lotus] in the valleys of the Hinggan Mountains. Lotus is originally a tropical plant, introduced to China from India with the eastward spread of Buddhism. However, its wild original species can propagate in the high and cold Hinggan Mountains, completely overturning previous theories. In terms of geology, there is the theory of the movement of the Mongolian desert, and the existence of salt lakes is also an incredible phenomenon. Since ancient times, salt extracted from the bottom of the lake has been sold by Lama monks to various parts of Mongolia. Recently, it has been heard that there are indeed mysterious areas in the mountains of the Xing'an Mountains, such as the original environment of stratigraphy and paleontology, and the Mongolian desert area contains the remains of prehistoric humans, dragons, jackals, and other creatures from millions of years ago. Therefore, once unearthed, it will surely cause a huge shock in the academic world. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Arrives in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Sun discusses land reclamation plans, He Sui accompanies him to Suiyuan. Communications from Yuanyuan: Sun Dianying, Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Army Corps and Director of Land Reclamation in the Western Qinghai Region, accompanied by He Sui, Commander of the Fifty-fifth Army, arrived at Baichaigou Fort from the west by special train at 5 PM on the 20th. Accompanying them were Wei Jiliang, Chief of Staff of the Forty-first Army, Zhang Luxian, Secretary-General, Lu Houzhai, Adjutant, and a company of guards. When passing through Datong, they disembarked and stayed for a day and night to confer with Sun Chu and Zhao Chengzhou. On the morning of the 22nd at 11 AM, they came to Suiyuan from Datong. All circles warmly welcomed them at the station. Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Seventh Army Corps and Chairman of the Provincial Government, Wang Jingguo, Commander of the Seventieth Division and Garrison Commander, Yuan Qingzeng, Director of Civil Affairs and Police Commissioner of the Provincial Capital, Pan Xiuren, Director of Education and Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Executive Committee, Zhao Yunyi, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Executive Committee, Ji Shouguang and Zhang Shoujian, Provincial Supervisory Committee Members, Xu Lizhong, Major General Counselor of the Forty-first Army, and others were waiting at the station to welcome them. The special train entered the station amidst the strains of military music. Mr. Sun immediately got off the train and shook hands with all those who welcomed him as a courtesy. Mr. Sun had a clear and lean face, with bright and piercing eyes. He wore a full set of old gray cloth military uniform and blue serge shoes. His appearance was no different from an ordinary soldier. Afterwards, Mr. Sun, accompanied by He Sui and Fu Zuoyi, and others left the station. Sun and Fu rode in the same car, while He, Wang, and Xu (Lizhong) rode in another car, heading straight to the Suiyuan Hotel. At noon, Fu hosted a banquet to welcome Sun and He, and invited dignitaries from all circles to accompany them. After taking his seat, Mr. Sun, due to excessive fatigue from the journey, and suffering from the cold at night while passing through the Fengzhen Pingdiquan area, suddenly had a bout of malaria and could hardly bear it. He then excused himself to rest upstairs and requested a doctor to treat him, which cured him. At 5 PM, Fu Zuoyi and Wang Jingguo held another public banquet for Sun and others, still inviting dignitaries to accompany them. After the banquet, they left Suiyuan for Baotou by the original train. When Mr. Sun was at the Suiyuan Hotel, he met with reporters and made the following statement: [The land reclamation plan in Qinghai is currently being drafted. Once it is drafted, it will be announced. The first step in the plan is the issue of deployment. In total, from departure to deployment, it will cost about 1.1 million yuan. The cost of deployment along the way alone will be 400,000 yuan. Currently, the Central Government has only allocated 100,000 yuan, which is a significant shortfall. The Central Government has agreed to continue to allocate as much as possible after the troops arrive in Baotou. Currently, our troops are rushing to make a large number of tents and kettles for marching. Within the realm of possibility, we will absolutely not disturb the common people. If military expenses are insufficient, in desperation, we will have to ask the common people to provide some food and drink. As for the destination of our troops' land reclamation, we plan to start in the "Racecourse" area in northwestern Qinghai. The area is about 500 miles in radius, which is enough for several years of reclamation. We will absolutely not encroach on the wasteland owned by the people. As for the Qinghai Western Region Land Reclamation Supervisory Office, the size of the organization will be determined by the amount of funding in the future. Our troops can be fully assembled in about ten days. The journey to Qinghai is expected to take two months on foot. Including rest along the way, it will take more than three months to reach Qinghai. The Han, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan people in Qinghai have sent representatives to welcome our troops to Qinghai. However, I have heard that the officials seem to have the intention of rejecting us. I (Sun himself) have already sent personnel to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and explain everything. Our troops have been ordered to carry out land reclamation. We are determined to follow the Central Government's instructions and move forward courageously. I only hope that the Qinghai authorities can give our troops a route so that we can pass through. Since I have left the vortex of internal strife this time to carry out land reclamation in Qinghai, I will absolutely not fire a single bullet domestically unless it is absolutely necessary. The rumors that our troops will stop in Ningxia along the way are all speculation and are absolutely not accurate. I do not understand the situation in Chahar very well. The Chahar issue has two solutions: (1) Feng softens, (2) the Central Government seeks a new path. I have always advised Chairman Chiang to resolve it peacefully. Because I don't have enough friendship with Mr. Feng, even if I have any opinions, I am afraid it will be difficult to be accepted, unlike Mr. Yan, because of the many years of relationship, I can say anything. Moreover, our troops have been completely supplied by Mr. Yan for the past few years. After I arrive in Baotou, I plan to make some preparations, dispatch a group of advance personnel to Wuyuan to set up a supply station, and then return to Suiyuan soon, and go to Shanxi to meet with Director Yan (Xishan) to discuss the issue of the deployment of our 16,000 to 17,000 troops stationed in Shanxi and other matters."</p>
<p>Furthermore, He Sui, Commander of the Fifty-fifth Army, made the following statement: ["My (He himself) Fifty-fifth Army was formed from the old troops of Tang Yulin. According to Tang's troops, there were originally 30,000 people. When Tang retreated to the Guyuan area after abandoning Chengde, there were still more than 20,000 people. Since Tang surrendered to the puppet state, many of his troops have been scattered. Currently, my troops consist of one division and one brigade, about 15,000 people. Except for one supplementary brigade that has not been deployed, the rest have all arrived in Baotou. It is well known that Tang's old troops used to have lax discipline. Since the reorganization, under the command of Commander-in-Chief Sun (Dianying), they have been strictly rectified, and they are now better. Chinese people have always turned pale at the mention of the word 'soldiers'. I believe that military officers can train soldiers to be adults."] (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Three Ships Including the Haiqi Subordinated to the Guangdong Military Department</h3>
<p>The Southwest Political Affairs Council issued a clear order for Chen Jitang to properly organize the three ships and incorporate them into the coastal defense fleet under the fleet headquarters. A Guangzhou dispatch: Since the three ships of the Bohai Sea sailed to Huangpu, Guangdong, the matter of incorporation has become increasingly satisfactory. However, the issue of affiliation has not been resolved for a long time. Initially, the First Army Group provided food and other supplies. Later, the Southwest Political Affairs Council advocated for their incorporation by the council, and for the establishment of a ship affairs office directly under the council to oversee the Haiqi and other three ships, specifically for coastal defense. Therefore, the Political Affairs Council paid great attention to the incorporation of the three ships at that time. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the issue took a sudden turn, and the notion of the Southwest Political Affairs Council setting up an office to oversee them suddenly changed to allocating them to Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, for proper organization. The reason why the Political Affairs Council abandoned the incorporation was entirely because the funding problem could not be resolved. Therefore, in the end, it had no choice but to hand it over to a powerful figure to handle. The Political Affairs Council issued two orders yesterday. One order was to inform the officers and soldiers of the three ships, and the other was for Chen Jitang to be responsible for the incorporation. The original order read: [For the purpose of issuing an order, the entire officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers of the Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhahe ships, leading their teams to the south, continue to work hard, with loyalty and devotion, which is deeply appreciated. The fleet has a long and glorious history of serving in national defense. Now, flying south, they are committed to the revolution, and will surely defend the borders and achieve great feats. They should be handed over to the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group for proper organization, diligent training, so that they can be put to use. Now, when financial resources are stretched, all pay and supplies must be vigorously economized. The officers and soldiers of the fleet have all come from hardships, and should be able to understand this. In addition to a clear order, this order is issued to the Commander-in-Chief to immediately comply. This order.] After Chen Jitang received the order, he hosted a banquet for the officers of the Haiqi and other three ships at the Naval Alumni Association on the South Embankment on the 22nd. Present were Jiang Xiyuan, Captain of the Haiqi, Guan Jizhou, Captain of the Haizhao, Ran Baiqing, Captain of the Zhaohe, and Yang Chaolun. Senior military and political officials also accompanied them at the banquet. Chairman Chen Jitang delivered a speech on the spot, stating that the Southwest authorities greatly appreciated the comrades of the three ships coming south together to resist Japan. He believed that the officers and soldiers with this indomitable spirit would be able to build for the country. He hoped that the Southwest naval, land, and air forces would unite and work together to bear the responsibility of saving the country and the people. After the speech, drinks were exchanged until the afternoon when the banquet ended happily. It is heard that the First Army Group, in order to save expenses, does not want to set up a separate agency to control the three ships, but only hands them over to the fleet headquarters under the original Japanese military department. However, the ships will be reorganized, divided into coastal defense ships and river defense ships. The old offshore Haihu, Fuan, Wufeng, Hairui, etc., will be combined with the Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe to form a coastal defense fleet. The other inland river ships will be formed into a river defense fleet. Zhang Zhiying, the fleet commander, will remain in his post. Jiang Xiyuan will be promoted to Rear Admiral and Deputy Commander, and concurrently the Coastal Defense Fleet Commander. Li Qingwen will be transferred and promoted to River Defense Fleet Commander. As for the expenses of the three coastal defense ships including the Haiqi, it has been decided to reduce them appropriately to comply with the naval budget. (July 23rd)</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi Expand Their Air Forces</h3>
<p>Guangdong expands a squadron and trains for night flight, Guangxi expands a group and opens a Guangxi Aviation School. Guangzhou communications: Guangdong Province has recently been actively expanding its air force strength. The foreign aircraft purchased have been shipped in batches. It is found that most of the recent purchases are fighter jets and destroyers. As for aviation military supplies, such as anti-aircraft guns, air-to-air machine guns, and searchlights for night navigation and other necessary equipment, they are generally complete. The types of aircraft include bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, etc., which are shipped from overseas and can be fully shipped to the province by the end of August. The aircraft that have been shipped are enough to expand a squadron. It is heard that the authorities plan to form the Sixth Squadron in early August, with overseas Chinese trainee pilots as members. Ma Tinghuai, deputy of the fourth team and director of the overseas Chinese trainee class, will be promoted to the commander of the Sixth Squadron. After the Sixth Squadron is established, the entire air force will be reorganized into two groups, each group commanding three squadrons. Tan Shouting and Ji Xu will be appointed as the first and second group commanders respectively. In order to train students for night flight, the Air Force Headquarters has dispatched Ding Jixu, commander of the second team, to lead the aircraft to train for night flight starting this month. At 7 or 8 o'clock every night, the sound of aircraft can be heard in the sky. From the hazy twilight, three aircraft can be vaguely seen, one leading the way and two flying side by side, in a triangular formation. Each night navigation aircraft is equipped with red and green lights as a symbol. Since the start of the voyage, it has felt safe. Every night, they fly until about 9 o'clock before slowly descending to the Shougouling airport. It is heard that night flight practice is scheduled by the Air Force Department to allow each team to take turns practicing. As for Guangxi Province, its air force training is no less than its army training. Since the establishment of the Guangxi Aviation Office, in addition to purchasing more aircraft, it has also expanded the airport in Liuzhou and built hangars. After the formation of a squadron of aircraft some time ago, it also transferred back the sixth class B of Guangxi students who graduated from the Guangdong Aviation School. This group of graduates will be used to form another aircraft group, for a total of two groups. In addition, in order to cultivate future aviation talents, it has specially opened an aviation school on its own, and hired Yang Guanyu, the former principal of the Guangdong Aviation School (currently serving as the captain of the aviation team of the Fujian Pacification Office), as the principal. Yang is scheduled to go to Guangxi within a few days, and the school is scheduled to start enrolling students in August. (July 22nd)</p>
<h3>Red Bandits Retreat from Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>Most of them retreated to Eastern Jiangxi, and the Nineteenth Route Army added two divisions. Fuzhou communications: The Red bandits in Eastern Jiangxi broke into Northern Fujian at the beginning of the month, and their momentum was very rampant. After the troops of Liu Heding, Lu Xingbang, Zhou Zhiqun, and Ma Hongxing tied them back, there is no bandit trace in Shaowu and Jiangle counties. Most of the bandits retreated to Guangze and Taining. The pursuit team formed by the combined forces of Liu's division and Zhou's brigade is advancing towards Guangze. Currently, only Huang Ligui's force of about 3,000 people remains in the city of Guangze. Refugees from Shaojiang and Jiang counties who had taken refuge in Shunchang and Nanping are now returning to their hometowns as the local area is gradually becoming peaceful. As for the battle lines in Mingxi and Qingliu counties, they have become semi-circular.</p>
<p>Starting from Quanshang Wucun in the north and ending at Luokou Beituan in the south, our side has built solid defensive works along the way. The two brigades of Lu Guilü and Xing Rong and Zhang Xingrong, together with Ma Hongxing's troops, are guarding the dangerous terrain. The bandits, led by Peng Dehuai with a large number of bandits, are attacking with all their strength, trying to break into Yong'an and Shaxian from Mingxi and Qingliu, threatening Liancheng and Longyan, so that the bandit suppression army in Western Fujian has worries about the rear. After Lu's division and Ma's troops bombarded fiercely with artillery fire at Quanshang and Wucun, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and could not support themselves. They began to retreat into Ninghua. Lu's division also contacted Qu Shounian's troops, and the defenses between Yong'an and Liancheng have been consolidated. As for the bandits, because their plans did not succeed and it was difficult to supply food, they have been divided by Guangze and Ninghua and retreated to Eastern Jiangxi. Liu, Lu, Zhou, and Ma's troops also suffered considerable losses as a result of days of fierce fighting and are currently reorganizing.</p>
<p>Since spring, Shaojiang, Ming and Qing counties have been hit by famine.</p>
<p>All rely on the provincial capital to transport Sumi to provide relief. Farmers who cannot afford to buy miscellaneous food mostly fill their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark. The hungry are everywhere. Local communities have repeatedly sent telegrams to the province to appeal. Now they have been disrupted by bandits again, and with the gathering of large armies, the people are even more distressed. Currently, with regard to the rice shortage, the Relief Committee is planning to raise funds for relief and is requesting the Central Relief Committee to allocate funds for relief as soon as possible. With regard to the bandit disaster, the provincial government will raise donations from overseas Chinese. The chairman of the provincial government will serve as the commander of the fundraising team and ask the leaders of overseas Chinese merchants to serve as captains of the sub-teams to help with fundraising. Detailed regulations are being planned.</p>
<p>The two column commanders of the Nineteenth Route Army who specially formed a team to go north to resist Japan have been promoted to division commanders after returning to Fujian. Zhang Yan, commander of the First Column, was appointed as the commander of the 49th Division, that is, the original two regiments of the 49th Division and the four regiments of the first and second columns of the 19th Route Army were combined into one division. He has already taken office in Yongding some time ago. The division plans to stay in Western Fujian to assist in suppressing bandits. Tan Qixiu, commander of the Second Column, was appointed as the commander of the Supplementary Division. The three regiments of the Supplementary Brigade of the Nineteenth Route Army currently stationed in Zhangzhou and the Special Service Regiment currently stationed in Minqing were combined into one division. Tan flew from Zhangzhou to the province on the 16th to prepare for the organization of the Supplementary Division headquarters. The Supplementary Brigade will be transferred from Quanzhou to the province within a few days to await reorganization. The division will be stationed in Fuzhou to serve as the provincial defense. (July 18th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Please investigate the case of indiscriminate shooting. Gu, a native of Songjiang, and others in Beijing, after seeing a newspaper report that the Songjiang Tax Police Training Institute held a graduation ceremony on the 16th, and during the extracurricular activities, Tao Bokang, an innocent civilian who was bareheaded and barefoot standing on the stage, was shot, sent a telegram to the tax police authority yesterday requesting them to send someone to investigate. The text reads (omitted above). It is found that during the graduation performance and extracurricular activities of the training institute, the man, as a civilian, broke in to watch, and even dared to approach the stage, ignoring the director's warning, resulting in injury, which was his own fault. However, according to the newspaper report, the only one who was bareheaded and barefoot stubbornly standing on the stage at that time was this man. Since the institute had guards on the scene, it would not be difficult to drag him down by force. If he was disrupting the meeting, Director Shen of the Public Security Bureau was also present at the scene at that time, and he could have been handed over to the bureau for questioning. However, Director Yao's tiger power was unleashed, and the guards immediately shot him. Even in front of the public at the meeting, this bloody tragedy could not be avoided. The director may have thought that it was a necessary action to maintain order at the meeting, but it is inconsistent with your Excellency's aim of cherishing people's lives and strictly enforcing discipline. Moreover, Director Yao has the heavy responsibility of training tax police officers, and on the day of the students' graduation, he committed such a violent act of disregarding people's lives, which is also contrary to the principle of setting an example. A certain person and others, for the sake of protecting the tax police and for the sake of the lives of the people in their hometown, dare not suppress it from above, so they specially send a telegram to your Excellency requesting you to send someone to investigate and order that civilians should not be shot indiscriminately in the future, so as to value people's lives and maintain police reputation. Facing the telegram, they are extremely frightened and await orders.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Bandits Who Robbed the Su Jialun Ship Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>The Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters previously captured Liu Hanchen, Cao Yaoguang, Zheng Jinfu (also known as Zheng San) and other nine Henan bandits who robbed the Su Jialun ship, as well as Zhang Lao Zhang, Jin A'er, Fei Jinshi, Zhu Shuliang, Lin Hongchang, Zou Shude and other Wujiang Beigang kidnappers. After they were escorted to the Wujiang County Government, yesterday (the 27th) at 9 AM, the county government of the town tied Liu Hanchen, Zhang Lao Zhang and other nine bandits to the execution ground outside the East Gate and executed them by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Adulterous Woman and Her Lover Cause a Bloody Case</h3>
<p>Na Yinhang, a resident of Tonghui Commercial Bridge North Pier in this town, is 40 years old and from Hefei, Anhui. He used to work in the anti-smuggling salt affairs camp. In 1911, he became acquainted with a woman surnamed Wang (28 years old) from Jingjiang and spent 100 yuan to become husband and wife and live together. In recent years, Xing Yinhang has been unemployed at home, which has led to financial difficulties. Wang is naturally promiscuous and seeks new pleasure. She has also become acquainted with Zhu Zhongguang (29 years old), a tailor who is a fellow villager and works in the same industry. They come and go secretly, not just once. Unexpectedly, the matter was not secret, and Xing found out. He was very jealous and repeatedly tried to catch them in the act, but he could not obtain human evidence. The other day, Xing Yinhang suddenly came up with a plan, falsely claiming to go to Shanghai to seek employment. He climbed onto the roof at night and secretly investigated. Yesterday (the 27th) at about 3 AM, Zhu Zhongguang really came to Xing's house to party with Wang. While they were clouding the rain, Xing Yinhang came down from the roof, took a sharp knife, and pounced into the room. He dragged Zhu Zhongguang out naked and stabbed him several times in the head, legs, lower abdomen and other places. Fresh blood flowed. He ran wildly and fled to Zhangxiang Shang nearby, where he fell down with only a faint breath. Wang was also hit in the head and hands with an iron ruler. Xing himself also had abrasions on his knees and feet. The blood was dripping, which was unbearable to look at. Afterwards, someone reported it to the Wuqiao Police Station of the Fifth Public Security Sub-Bureau, which brought the three injured people to the station together and transferred them to the Fifth Sub-Bureau. The Director Qiang of the bureau opened a court for preliminary questioning. As the case was related to injury, it was immediately transferred to the county court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Clerk Punished for Malfeasance</h3>
<p>Wu Jianqiu, a native of Yunting Township, was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment by the Wuxian Local Court. Wu refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the collegial panel of the court. The sentence was announced on the 22nd, the original judgment was revoked, and he was sentenced to two years and two months of imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan. Wu requested to suspend the detention. Because his mother had died and his wife had died, there was no one at home. The land court immediately sent a telegram to County Chief Ruan to send bailiff Wu Bowen to investigate. According to the report, his mother, Ye, had indeed died of illness, and his wife, Zhang, had attempted suicide once after hearing that her husband had been sentenced, and is now seriously ill. He immediately reported it to the land court for verification.</p>
<h3>Two Bandits in Zhenjiang Escorted to the Martial Law Department</h3>
<p>The other night, Ren Zhaoyuan's house in Chaoshuigou was robbed by bandits. Two bandits, Yang Yugao and Li Chunsheng, were arrested on the spot, and the mother of the escaped bandit Yuan Jiaxiang, Ju, and Wang, a liaison officer, were taken to the station together and transferred to the General Bureau for questioning. After being questioned by the Judicial Section of the General Bureau, the bandits confessed without denial. According to the confession, the General Bureau immediately escorted the two criminals, Li Chunsheng and Chang Yugao, to the Martial Law Command for questioning.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Defense Donation Approved</h3>
<p>The defense expenses of this county have not been settled. Gao Xicheng, director of the Defense Expenses Management Office, previously drafted measures for collecting defense donations: (1) A donation of two cents per mu will be collected under the item of farmland; (2)</p>
<p>Collect business capital donations. He then requested the County Defense Committee to forward it to the Provincial Defense Committee for approval, which has been approved by the committee and ordered the county to comply. In addition to instructing all food clerks to report the farmland collection register, the county government also ordered the district chiefs to investigate the amount of capital of the shops in their respective districts and report it to the register so that donations could be drawn separately.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Cidong Road Workers and Villagers Fight</h3>
<p>The road workers of the Cifeng Road Engineering Office's Cifeng Wenxi Second Section are mostly from Jiangbei. At that time, the wife of a Wenzhou man named Jia, who lived in the area, was raped by four road workers while Jia was out. Later, Jia, because of his weak power, sold his wife to someone and moved to another place. On the 24th of this month, Zhou Abiao, a farmer from Duwuao, and his wife Wang Xiuqing (17 years old), had a lot of melons and fruits planted, so they took turns to guard them to prevent people from stealing them. That night, when Xiuqing was on guard, several Jiangbei road workers went to steal melons. Xiuqing found out and shouted loudly, causing the workers to get angry and beat Xiuqing violently. The matter was heard by the director of the section, who sent the supervisor, Rong, to persuade them, but he was also beaten by the workers and Rong and Xiuqing were tied up and hidden in a secret room. Later, the section director sent someone to persuade them to save them, but they were also beaten severely. As a result, the villagers were greatly indignant and gathered forty or fifty people, each holding hoes and rakes, to question the road workers. The road workers also did not show weakness, each holding wooden sticks and iron shovels to meet the enemy. As a result of the bloody battle, four villagers were seriously injured and one was slightly injured. Two road workers were seriously injured. Afterwards, the county government sent a team to come and detained ten workers. They also rescued Xiuqing and Rong in the workers' dormitory. They were all taken to the county for questioning. After verification, the seriously injured were sent to the Baoli Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Scheduled to Open to Longyou</h3>
<p>The Jiangbian-Lanxi section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was completed and opened to traffic earlier. The entire Jinhua-Yushan section has been completed and can be reached directly to Jiangxi, which is extremely convenient for military transportation for bandit suppression. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once telegraphed a deadline for the completion of construction within the year. In order to speed up the work, the bureau specially moved the Engineering Department to Jinhua and urged the work day and night. The distance from Jinhua Station to the Jinhua River Bridge is 6 kilometers. All nailing roads, bridges, and culverts have been completed. The Jinhua River Bridge is 54 feet high and has a total of thirteen bridge piers, all made of concrete. The project is solid. Seven of the bridge piers and steel beams have been erected. However, in order to save expenses, iron railings will not be built for the time being and passage will be prohibited. Each pier has a refuge to avoid danger. In recent days, the nailing of the road above the Jinhua River will reach Tangxi, and the vehicles on the road will open to Longyou County starting in early September.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Investigates and Confiscates the Property of the Traitor Zhang Jingyao</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingyao, the traitor who was assassinated in Beiping last month, was originally from Huoqiu County, Anhui. During his lifetime, he held important positions in the Northern Government and amassed a great fortune after years of exploitation. The Anhui Provincial Government was ordered to investigate and confiscate his traitorous property and specially appointed Commissioner Zhu Chuting to handle the case. He once held Zhang Xiangchen, Zhang's cousin, in custody to recover rent. Zhang Xiangchen falsely claimed that it was his own private property. Commissioner Zhu asked the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. The Department of Civil Affairs replied by telegram ordering him to quickly recover the rent according to the rental register, and not to listen to lies lightly or engage in favoritism. Zhu has now started to implement the confiscation after receiving the telegram. It is heard that Zhang's rental register in Huoqiu has an annual income of 50,000 shi.</p>

<h3>News of the Lushan Conference in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The main agenda is to discuss military construction. A certain central committee member in Shanghai received a telegram from Guling yesterday saying that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a conference in Guling this time entirely to discuss important issues related to military affairs, such as the organization of the national army, the construction of the air force, and how to adapt to various military tasks in the bandit suppression area. Chiang has now consulted with various military officers and reached an agreement, which will be implemented step by step. As for the aftermath of North China, the Chahar situation, and the Xinjiang incident, he will discuss the methods separately with President Wang and various ministers, and President Wang will implement them after returning to Nanjing. According to another message, during the conference in Guling, some dignitaries advocated taking effective measures against Feng in Chahar. After detailed discussion by the dignitaries, the result was to maintain the original intention of peace and seek solutions through political methods.</p>
<h3>Feng Telegraphed to Defend Duolun</h3>
<p>Three more divisions were sent to defend it and telegraphed to Shanghai to express their determination. Since Duolun was recaptured, the Japanese and puppet troops have been actively mobilizing troops and generals, transporting military supplies, preparing to invade Chahar again. Feng in Chahar is also increasing his strength in Duolun, preparing to defend the territory to the death. Yesterday, Feng sent a telegram to Shanghai expressing his determination to defend the territory. The original telegram reads: Duolun City was originally defended by Ji Hongchang's troops. Wang Ling and Yao Jingchuan were recently transferred to assist with the three divisions of Pingzhi. The city can be broken and the head can be cut off, but the national territory must not be given to others by an inch. (Omitted) The atmosphere here is very tense. I hope you will quickly raise your arms and rise up to advocate justice for these tens of millions of anti-Japanese heroes. Feng Yuxiang.</p>
<p>League of Nations technical cooperation issues</p>
<h3>Japanese Attempts to Disrupt</h3>
<p>Knowing that it is already isolated, Japan tries to seek foreign aid by befriending the United States, instigates our internal affairs, and sends Sugimura to China. According to the New Voice Society, the Japanese government is paying close attention to Finance Minister Song Ziwen's efforts to secure loans in Europe and the United States, and to cooperate technically with the League of Nations to develop our country's industries. A reporter from the New Voice Society discussed this issue with Suma, the counselor of the Japanese consulate in Shanghai. Suma made threatening remarks, saying that there was a possibility of creating a second "Manchukuo" and a second Shanghai Incident, in order to threaten our government and other related countries with words. Several days later, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, formally expressing Japan's intention, which was full of jealousy and intimidation, echoing Suma's words. This has aroused great attention in our country's public opinion circles. However, our country has the independent right to use foreign capital to develop industries. Whether this constitutes international co-management and whether it allows interference from third countries, knowledgeable people can judge from the facts. As for what Japan will do about this, we can easily predict it based on reason and facts. There is no need for further comment. Recently, due to the military and political conference convened by Chairman Jiang in Lushan, and the unclear situation in Chahar, Japanese newspapers have launched a series of attacks on our country's internal affairs with rumors and instigation. The Japanese government also plans to send Minister Sugimura to China. We have collected the information and extracted the main points as follows, in order to understand Japan's measures and its propaganda.</p>
<h3>Trapping Japan in Isolation</h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of the 21st of this month, regarding Song Ziwen's activities abroad and Rajchman's visit to China, it is said that the Chinese government is taking advantage of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations to carry out various schemes. Song Ziwen attended the London World Economic Conference and planned to trap Japan in international isolation, entering into agreements with countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Germany to import weapons and other loans. It also formed a united front with the central forces of the League of Nations, establishing a [Special Committee of the League Council on Technical Cooperation with China] in the League of Nations to serve as a control mechanism for the League's [technical cooperation] with China, and appointed Rajchman, the Director of the Health Section of the League Secretariat, as the resident representative in China.</p>
<h3>Rajchman's Report</h3>
<p>Initially, the League of Nations stated that Rajchman's activities in China would not be related to political issues. Rajchman was only instructed to submit four reports on cooperation to the League of Nations each year. Other interim reports would notify Secretary-General Avenol of political issues. As for Rajchman's salary and all expenses, they would be entirely paid by the Chinese government. With the establishment of this agreement, Rajchman will not only engage in health care, but will also become the leader of the League of Nations faction in China, and will almost reign over the National Government. Therefore, Rajchman, who will return to China with Song Ziwen, will cause a significant shift in China's foreign policy, which is a secret that Japan, which has close relations with China, and other countries are paying close attention to.</p>
<h3>British Loan Control</h3>
<p>Sir Salter, who initially represented Britain on the German Reparations Committee, later transferred to the League of Nations and became the Director of the Economic and Financial Section, is a financier known for his agile skills. When Song Ziwen arrived in the UK, he began negotiations with the UK. He will accept the formal appointment of the Chinese government and decide to come to China recently to investigate China's economic situation. According to information released by the Ministry of the Army on the 21st, Song Ziwen's loan negotiations with the UK, its allocation purpose, are: (1) The Ministry of Railways, to complete the Yuehan Railway, public bonds of 1.2 million pounds, material costs of 1.6 million pounds, and other 4.62 million pounds; (2) The Ministry of Communications, increasing telecommunications equipment and communication material costs of 48,000 pounds; (3) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to purchase six ships, totaling 400,000 pounds; (4)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education sends 20 students to study in the UK.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Allocation Issues</h3>
<p>The newspaper also stated that Chairman Jiang convened the Lushan Conference to discuss financial issues, namely the issue of how to dispose of Song Ziwen's $50 million cotton and wheat loan from the United States. On this point, newspapers related to Wang Jingwei advocated that the loan be used for construction. Wang Jingwei himself also strongly advocated the political theory of "seeking unification through construction." On the other hand, those who advocated believed that China's biggest problem at present is how to quell internal strife and seek the completion of unification through the expansion of military affairs. There was a dispute between the two. However, Kong Xiangxi and Zou Lin, who attended the Lushan Conference, had appropriate compromise views on the allocation of loans. The final decision still awaits Song Ziwen's opinion.</p>
<h3>Deterioration of Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>In addition, the Asahi Shimbun's special correspondent in Beiping sent a telegram on the 21st, saying that Song Ziwen is about to return home, and all parties are paying attention to his attitude after returning home. This time, the establishment of a huge loan during his trip will lead to the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations. Technical cooperation with the League of Nations will also further lead China to international co-management. Many important Chinese figures are quite worried about this. In the government, even greater waves are being stirred up. The most obvious is Huang Fu, who is stabilizing the political situation in North China. Huang Fu is negotiating with Japan to seek a good solution to the complex Sino-Japanese relationship. Song Ziwen's actions will inevitably lead to the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations again. Huang Fu is currently discussing with the central government. According to observations by Japanese civil and military officials in North China, Song Ziwen has no intention of resisting the general trend. In the future, the National Government will use Jiang's military affairs, Wang's diplomacy, and Song's finance to get out of the current predicament and establish a policy of peace and security. However, the Japanese authorities should be very vigilant about Song Ziwen's return home.</p>
<h3>Huang Yan Express Opposition</h3>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun's morning edition on the 21st published that Yan Xishan in Shanxi and Huang Fu in Beiping, the leaders of the anti-League of Nations faction in China, had issued a telegram, saying that Song Ziwen had not obtained the understanding of the Legislative Yuan to carry out loan negotiations with various countries and shook hands with the League of Nations, declaring it illegal. On July 17, the Dagongbao expressed opposition to Japan's aggression against China and supported the establishment of the League of Nations Technical Cooperation Committee for China, using foreign economic assistance to carry out internal reforms. However, the Yishibao on the same day also stated that it would accept the joint invasion of the League of Nations in place of Japan's individual invasion, paying attention to the result that China would fall into, which would be the loss of sovereignty, and later become a colony of various countries.</p>
<h3>Sending Envoys to China to Ease Tensions</h3>
<p>The above is the general situation reported by Japanese newspapers. Between the lines, we can see their intention to spread rumors and instigate discord everywhere. As for Japan's measures in response, in addition to submitting a protest to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, which has been rejected, its main countermeasure, according to powerful opinions within the Japanese government, is to send Minister Sugimura to China to ease our country's anti-Japanese sentiment and obtain what they call a fair attitude towards Japan. In addition, since the United States is a non-member country, it will also adopt a pro-American policy to seek foreign aid. But the first step is still to send Sugimura to China. Sugimura has worked in the League of Nations Secretariat and is a close friend of Rajchman. He is also quite familiar with Chinese diplomats in the League of Nations. However, whether he will accept the appointment to China is still undecided.</p>
<h3>Sugimura Expresses Opinions</h3>
<p>According to Sugimura's statement to Japanese reporters, Rajchman's actions in China are extremely important in relation to Japan. In addition to the revision of the Japanese-Russian fisheries agreement at the Second Washington Conference, Japan's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations is scheduled for 1935. Japan can focus on various planned activities in the next year or two. Whether it is the government or private organizations, they should thoroughly proceed in this direction. However, he expressed his firm refusal to be sent to China. Sugimura's opinions have been considered by the Japanese Foreign Minister. However, Sugimura himself may eventually be entrusted with the task due to the government's determination. This is a prediction by Japanese reporters.</p>
<h3>Naming of Five Joint Aircraft</h3>
<p>Organizing Preparatory Committee. According to the Guowenshe News Agency, the China Aviation Association ordered 18 Eagle brand aircraft from the Curtiss Company in the United States. The Shanghai No. 1 has already held a naming ceremony. Several of the second batch have arrived in Shanghai. The five groups, including Shanghai No. 2 and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc., that purchased the aircraft from the Association, have scheduled a joint naming ceremony for August 12. It is now planned to organize a preparatory committee to arrange the ceremony and performance in advance. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Organizing the Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Shanghai No. 2, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Industry, Municipal Education, Ningbo, and other five aircraft have been scheduled to hold a naming ceremony on August 12. However, in order to decide the location, maintain order, and prepare the ceremony and performance in advance, a preparatory committee is required to arrange in advance. Therefore, the Aviation Association initiated a request</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Public Security Bureau Security Section Conscription Team Office, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Municipal Education Association, Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, etc., each sent a representative to form a preparatory committee to be responsible for contacting various matters.</p>
<h3>Telegraphing to Request Aircraft</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association believes that individual aircraft performances have been carried out by many people. Now, in order to enhance the concept of aviation and improve knowledge of the air force, it plans to take the opportunity of the joint naming of five aircraft to request the Aviation Administration and aviation schools to send aircraft to Shanghai to participate in the performance. Yesterday, the Association telegraphed Director of Aviation Administration Xu Peigen and Principal of Aviation School Mao Bangchu to request. It is reported that Commissioner Lin Wo-jiang will personally go to Hangzhou to discuss this matter within a few days.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Central Mint</h3>
<p>The 工務处(Engineering Department)is closed, and the 騐鎔鍊 (Assaying and Smelting), and 鑄造(Casting) three 課(Sections) are expanded to 處(Departments). The Section Chiefs are still concurrently served by the three Technicians who have been promoted. Guowenshe News Agency reports that the Central Mint, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, has expanded its internal organization, changing the three sections of assaying, smelting, and casting to departments. This has already been established. The reporter visited the factory yesterday to learn the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Originally Belonged to the Same Department</h3>
<p>The Central Mint initially focused on the equipment of engineering affairs, forming an Engineering Department. The three sections of assaying, smelting, and casting belonged to this department. The section chiefs were concurrently served by the three technicians, namely, 温宗禹(Wen Zongyu), the section chief of the assaying section; 黃福祥(Huang Fuxiang), the section chief of the smelting section; and 鍾望榮(Zhong Wangrong), the section chief of the casting section.</p>
<h3>Expansion Process</h3>
<p>Before Minister of Finance 宋子文(Song Ziwen) left Shanghai for the United States, 廠長(Factory Director) 廬學溥(Lu Xuepu), under orders to prepare for casting, believed that it was necessary to expand the above-mentioned three sections and at the same time planned to immediately abolish the Engineering Department. This plan was approved by Minister 宋(Song), who ordered it to be implemented on a trial basis first. After receiving the order, Director 盧(Lu) abolished the Engineering Department and changed the three sections of assaying, smelting, etc., to departments. The candidates for department chiefs were still promoted to concurrently serve as the three technicians, 温宗禹(Wen Zongyu), 黃福祥(Huang Fuxiang), and 鍾望榮(Zhong Wangrong). This has been officially established.</p>
<h3>Dai Ji Arrives This Morning</h3>
<p>He will go to Fujian in mid-August. According to the Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, 張襄(Zhang Xiang), speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday, 戴戟(Dai Ji) left Lushan by boat two days ago and returned east. It is expected that he will arrive in Nanjing yesterday (the 27th), and then change trains to come to Shanghai. He should arrive here today (the 28th). The Garrison Command is still working as usual, and the handover will be carried out after 戴(Dai) returns to Shanghai. The 一二八纪念堂 (January 28 Memorial Hall) is being actively arranged and should be officially established around the 10th of next month. It is heard that 戴(Dai)'s departure for Fujian to take up his new post will be in mid-August.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Returns to Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>He is taking the 普安(Pu'an) ship from Qingdao and will arrive this afternoon. 孫哲生(Sun Zhesheng) took the Taikoo Company ship from Shanghai to Qingdao on the 18th of this month to escape the summer heat. Yesterday, the local branch received a telegram from President 孫(Sun), stating that there were urgent political affairs to be discussed in the central government, and a telegram was sent to Qingdao urging him to return to Shanghai. Therefore, he took the China Merchants Bureau 普安(Pu'an) ship from Qingdao yesterday and set off for Shanghai. He is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 pm today. He will land at the Jinliyuan Wharf at that time.</p>
<h3>Ancient Artifacts of the Palace Museum Continued to be Inspected Yesterday</h3>
<p>The results showed no mildew or corrosion. The ancient artifacts transported from the Palace Museum in Beiping were inspected due to fears of humidity and insects in Shanghai. The Council of the Museum hired the Executive Yuan, Military Affairs Commission, Academia Sinica, Shanghai Local Court, and Shanghai Municipal Council to send personnel to form a supervisory committee. The box opening inspection began the day before yesterday and continued yesterday. The committee members 陈锐(Chen Rui) (Executive Yuan), 黄明豪(Huang Minghao) (Military Affairs Commission), 周仁(Zhou Ren) (Academia Sinica), 周寰轩(Zhou Huanxuan), and 庄尙严(Zhuang Shangyan) (Palace Museum) arrived and worked from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, inspecting more than a hundred boxes from the Ancient Artifacts Museum, Library, Literature Museum, and Secretariat. All boxes were dry and free of mildew and corrosion. The results were unusually good.</p>
<h3>County Government Opens Tax Collection, Busy Above and Below</h3>
<p>It is scheduled to start collection on August 1.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday, stating that, in accordance with the practice of merging the 上下忙銀(Shangxia Mang Yin) (land taxes) of the county since the 18th year of the Republic, and in accordance with the order of the Department of Finance to abolish the names of 忙漕(Mang Cao) (busy season taxes) and 銀米(yinmi) (silver and rice), and uniformly convert them into foreign codes, the land price tax will be collected starting from the 21st year. Now it is scheduled to start collection on August 1st, the 22nd year.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese General Association Opened the National Salvation General Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>It is heard that it was banned due to incomplete procedures. Peng Canguang was summoned and then released immediately. When various groups welcomed the heroes of the Anti-Japanese War last time, the Overseas Chinese General Association proposed the organization of a National Salvation General Assembly. At that time, the association was designated to prepare for it. The association convened a preparatory meeting at the Xinxin Restaurant yesterday to discuss the progress of the matter. However, due to incomplete procedures, it was interfered with, and there was a slight disturbance. Peng Canguang of the Overseas Chinese General Association was summoned. After the police inquired, he was released immediately. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives Attended</h3>
<p>Including Ma Zhanshan's representative Lang Guanpu, Li Du's representative Liu Piguang, the National Postal Service Union, the United National Salvation Association of various groups, the General Labor Union, the Postal Workers Union, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, overseas Chinese who were expelled from Mexico, overseas Chinese students returning to China who were expelled from Japan, the Citizens Union of the First Special Zone, the Citizens Union of the Second Special Zone, and representatives from more than 100 groups, including various trade associations and labor unions, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Chen Peide, Zhu Xuefan, and more than 500 people.</p>
<h3>Emergency Notice</h3>
<p>The meeting time was originally scheduled for 2:00 pm, but it had not started by 3:00 pm. Because there were many people and the weather was hot, the representatives questioned the Overseas Chinese General Association and posted a notice, saying: "The purpose of this association is to invite people from all walks of life to attend the meeting today to discuss the issue of national salvation. However, because it was held in a hurry, there may be some shortcomings. Although there are many participants from various groups and patriotic people from all walks of life, the number is still far from the ideal number. Therefore, it is not convenient to hold a formal meeting, and it is temporarily changed to a tea party. We will invite you again for guidance when there is an opportunity. We hereby declare this, and we hope for your understanding."</p>
<h3>Reason for the Statement</h3>
<p>The representatives read this notice and expressed their dissatisfaction. Peng Canguang of the Overseas Chinese General Association stated the reason, saying: "Today, our association invited representatives from all walks of life to come here, originally wanting to discuss national salvation matters with all walks of life. However, there are more than a thousand groups in Shanghai, but today only more than one hundred groups attended the meeting. These are a small number of groups and cannot replace the people of Shanghai. Therefore, we cannot hold a meeting and have changed it to a temporary tea party. Please forgive us."</p>
<h3>Temporary Chairman</h3>
<p>After this repeated statement, the crowd clamored, but it did not stop. Some people still advocated electing a temporary chairman. Lu Jingshi was elected as the temporary chairman. Lu immediately reported, saying: "Comrades, the Overseas Chinese General Association's gathering to discuss the meaning of national salvation is very pure, but the meeting place is so chaotic. Now, please ask the initiators to report the progress, and then decide whether to hold a formal meeting or a tea party." Then, Yan Dajue of the Overseas Chinese General Association reported the progress, saying: "The motivation for this meeting was the proposal made by the Overseas Chinese General Association at the welcome banquet for Ma Suli at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to form a National Salvation General Assembly. After the meeting, because the Overseas Chinese General Association was the initiator, the Overseas Chinese General Association started preparations. The standing committee decided to hold a preparatory meeting today to discuss the direction of progress. Because the procedures are not complete, it is proposed to postpone the meeting." After Yan's report was finished, the crowd proposed to change the meeting to be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The representatives gathered at the door of the Xinxin Company. Unexpectedly, the temporary chairman said that since the representatives had dispersed, it would be difficult to hold the meeting at the Chamber of Commerce, so the National Salvation Preparatory Meeting was declared dissolved.</p>
<h3>Authorities Banned</h3>
<p>After the incident, after investigation by reporters from the New Voice Society, it was learned that the Overseas Chinese General Association had not reported to the authorities in advance according to the law. When the meeting was held, the municipal government ordered it to be stopped. Therefore, the association temporarily posted a notice saying that the number of people was insufficient and the meeting would be postponed. The Municipal Council was afraid of causing trouble, so it took the Secretary-General of the Association, Peng Canguang, away for temporary custody. After questioning, he was released at 4:25.</p>
<p>The first phase of the annual land price tax is to be paid in full within two months. If it is overdue for two months, a surcharge of one-tenth of the regular provincial and county tax will be levied. The upper-class farmland will be charged a tax of two dimes, three cents, four mills, and four haos per mu. A collection fee of one cent and four mills and one hao will be charged. An education mu donation of one dime and six cents, a security corps donation of four cents, a farm donation of four li, and a supplementary fee for the 20th year of 清丈(qingzhang) (land survey) of one dime will be charged. The upper-class farmland will be charged a total of five dimes, five cents, two mills, and five haos per mu. The standard farmland will be charged a tax of two dimes, three cents, seven mills, and seven haos per mu. A collection fee of one cent and four mills and three haos will be charged. An education mu donation of one dime and six cents, a security corps donation of four cents, a farm donation of four li, and a supplementary fee for the 20th year 清丈(qingzhang) (land survey) of one dime will be charged. The standard farmland will be charged a total of five dimes, five cents, and six haos per mu. However, the 清丈(qingzhang) fee has been approved to be charged after the licenses have been printed. Therefore, a red stamp is added to the licenses. In addition to distributing the easy-to-know order forms to various kunye (捆業) (landowners) in accordance with the security map, this notice is issued so that the landowners may be fully aware of it and pay the required amount on time and check in the cupboard for peace, and do not wait and see and delay yourself, lest you incur reminders and recovery. This is very important.</p>
<h3>Maritime Administration Bureau Established Ship Collision Handling Committee</h3>

<h3>The Anti-Imperialist and Anti-War Conference Will Still be Held in Early September, It Is Said</h3>
<p>The Greater American Evening News reported that although there was a rumor that the conference convened by the World Anti-Imperialist and Anti-War League in Shanghai would be temporarily suspended due to the unfavorable environment, it was heard today (the 27th) that it would still be held as scheduled in early September. All the detailed plans for the meeting are expected to be announced by the person in charge of preparation soon. However, it is not yet certain whether the meeting will be held at the Ba Xian Qiao YMCA. It is said that three of the five representatives of 高 (Gao) have been arrested by the Japanese consulate in Shanghai, because the Japanese authorities believe that the conference will be detrimental to the policies of the Japanese. However, the details of the arrest have not been ascertained. It is also unknown whether these three people were sent by 高's (Gao's) own country or were recommended by patriotic people in Shanghai. It is also heard that three leaders of the radical faction will also attend from Japan. The French leftist writers Henri Barbusse and his wife will arrive in Shanghai this month to serve as French representatives. The famous American writer Theodore Dreiser and representatives from various countries will also arrive in Shanghai in early September. It is heard that the Chinese authorities do not want to allow them to hold a meeting in the concession and even intend to ban major newspapers from publishing news about the conference.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu's News in Shanghai about Returning Home to Build</h3>

Mr. Hu is a construction committee member of Fujian Province, and he made suggestions to the chairman of Fujian Province upon arriving there. At the beginning of his return to China, he telegraphed Mr. Hu Zhugeng, the manager of the Shanghai branch of Tiger Brand Yong An Tang, requesting him to serve as his secretary so that he could assist in handling all tasks in Fujian.

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Landlords Oppose Increasing Land Price Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council submitted it to the Economic Committee for discussion. According to the Central News Agency, after the Municipal Council estimated the land price in the concession in 1930, it began to levy land price tax in January 1931. Later, because the land price soared, which was very different from the original estimate, it was decided to re-estimate and collect it in 1932. At that time, the Songhu War broke out, so it was not held. It was not until June of this year that the work of re-estimating the land price was completed. It was originally scheduled to collect the land price tax from July 1, but Chinese and foreign landlords in the concession opposed the re-estimation of the land price and the increase of the land price tax and submitted a letter of protest to the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council submitted it to the Economic Committee, which decided to continue the discussion this Friday and then transfer it to the Municipal Council next Wednesday to determine the method.</p>

<p>Shanghai Telephone Bureau Will Cancel Toll Fees From Next Month</p>
<p>However, due to the insistence of the Concession Telephone Company, the Municipal Government ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to assist in negotiations. Although the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau have negotiated with the Concession Telephone Company several times regarding the five-cent toll fee for Chinese and foreign telephones, the Concession Telephone Company had little sincerity, and there were no results. It is now learned that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has decided to automatically cancel the fee on August 1 and has sent a letter to the Municipal Government, requesting the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to assist in handling the matter. The instructions of the Municipal Government and the future negotiation policy are recorded below.</p>
<h3>City Government Instruction</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of informing the Commissioner, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications sent a letter stating that the abolition of Sino-foreign telephone charges had been previously presented to your office, and you had reviewed and approved it. Later, reading a report in the local newspapers about Secretary-General Yu's remarks, it was gratifying to learn that this matter had been ordered by your government to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for assistance. We are deeply grateful for this. Our bureau has repeatedly consulted with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and worked together to proceed with the matter. However, the company has shown no sincerity due to vested interests. Now, due to the urging of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the concessions, our bureau, for the convenience of the public and the development of public and private businesses, intends to implement this independently from August 1st, in order to fulfill the expectations of the citizens and gradually seek a satisfactory solution. As for the concession telephones connected to the Chinese area, in addition to the two cents sacrificed by the bureau, the three cents payable to the company will be temporarily borne by our bureau. Please take note of this and we hereby submit this report. This instruction is hereby issued for your information.</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau stated that the five-cent fee for mutual telephone calls between Chinese and concession users in the city was stipulated in the communication contract between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the former Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company, and has been in place for eight years. The Public Utilities Bureau has long recognized that this charge not only increases the burden on users and causes inconvenience but also hinders the development of the telephone business. Therefore, in March of the 19th year, it submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministry of Communications for the reorganization of the Shanghai telephone system, which also included the cancellation of Sino-foreign telephone charges. Subsequently, the Municipal Government issued an order to forward the Ministry of Communications' reply, stating that Chinese and concession telephone users were previously unable to communicate with each other. After several negotiations, the connection was established in December of the 14th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the China and Foreign Company had a communication contract with clear provisions on the charging method, which could not be arbitrarily changed by one party. This contract will expire in December of this year, and the bureau should be instructed to consult with the company when renewing the contract to improve it as much as possible. Subsequently, the above communication contract expired on December 16th of the 19th year. At that time, the Ministry of Communications had not yet expressed any solution to the subsequent two-way communication and other important issues. The Public Utilities Bureau believed that it was difficult to stop Sino-concession communication in practice, and other important issues regarding telephone matters were also difficult to leave unresolved. However, a long-term solution could not be negotiated urgently. Therefore, it suggested first signing a temporary contract for a term of one year, and within this period, negotiating a long-term solution. Both parties expressed their agreement. Later, when the Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the representative of the Shanghai Telephone Company first discussed the draft temporary contract at the Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau proposed canceling the Sino-concession telephone charges to alleviate the burden on users. However, the company representative firmly refused to agree, arguing that canceling the telephone charges would have too much impact on the company's revenue. At that time, in addition to the two-way communication method, the temporary contract also urgently needed to resolve other important issues related to telephone matters, which should not be left unresolved for too long. The temporary contract was for a very short period, and the relationship was small. Therefore, it was agreed that the telephone charges would temporarily follow the previous method, and discussion would be held separately. This temporary contract was signed on April 19th of this year after several twists and turns. It was originally intended to negotiate the cancellation of the telephone charges in the shortest possible time. However, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, due to the increase in rental fees after the installation of automatic telephones, was eager to cancel the telephone charges to alleviate the burden on users. It had directly consulted with the Shanghai Telephone Company several times. The company consistently disagreed, citing the large loss and the provision of collecting telephone charges in the temporary contract, resulting in no result. Therefore, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Government for assistance, and the Municipal Government immediately ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to handle it appropriately. After receiving the order, the Public Utilities Bureau believed that although the collection of Sino-concession telephone charges was stipulated in the temporary contract, canceling the telephone charges would alleviate the burden on users. The Public Utilities Bureau should do its best to assist in order to benefit the citizens. Director Zheng of the Third Section went to the Shanghai Telephone Company to negotiate earnestly, but still without results. Most recently, on the 24th of this month, the Public Utilities Bureau invited Director Xu of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and Vice President Kilock of the Shanghai Telephone Company to the bureau to continue discussions. The company still argued that the temporary contract stipulated the collection of telephone charges, and that the company's revenue would be reduced after cancellation, making it impossible to compensate. The Director Xu of the Telephone Bureau said that if the Telephone Bureau canceled the telephone charges independently, it would still be responsible for paying the company three cents for each call, so the company's revenue would not be affected in the slightest. Perhaps the revenue could be increased, which would not conflict with the contract provisions. Finally, the company stated that if the Telephone Bureau insisted on canceling, it was a matter of the Telephone Bureau itself, and the company could not prevent it, but definitely could not agree. This was the process of the final negotiation to cancel the telephone charges. In short, although the Telephone Company tried its best to oppose it, in order to alleviate the burden on users, it was hoped that it could be canceled as soon as possible within the possible scope. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau recently increased telephone rental fees and wanted to alleviate the burden on users. If the telephone charges are cancelled independently, and in order to abide by the provisions of the temporary contract to collect telephone charges, the Shanghai Telephone Company will still be paid three cents for each call by the Telephone Bureau itself. Therefore, the Shanghai Telephone Company cannot prevent it. As for the Shanghai Telephone Company, although it may be difficult to force it to cancel it for a while, it should still continue to negotiate to achieve the goal of cancellation as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Continuing Negotiations</h3>
<p>According to Zheng Baocheng, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, to the Central News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications' automatic cancellation of the five-cent telephone charge shows a far-sighted vision. Although the Chinese area is temporarily sacrificing, the convenience of users will definitely increase the number of people in the Chinese area requesting to install telephones, and business will definitely develop. At the same time, if concession users want to talk to Chinese users, the concession telephone company will also pay the Shanghai Telephone Bureau three cents for the telephone charges. In the current situation, there are more calls from the concession to the Chinese area. Therefore, this income is enough to compensate. On the contrary, the concession telephone company only believes that the current number of concession users is more than that of Chinese users, and the implementation of the cancellation of telephone charges seems unfavorable. However, because of this, concession users feel unequal treatment with Chinese users, and the land in the Chinese area is vast, and the development of the urban area has been very rapid in recent years, so who knows whether the number of telephones installed in the Chinese area will not be more than that in the concession in the near future? This bureau is very regretful for the persistence of the concession telephone company this time. This bureau will continue to assist the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications in negotiating with the concession telephone company to cancel the telephone charges.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Collect Telegrams to the United States</h3>
<p>To be implemented early next month due to exchange rate relations, according to the Great American Evening Post, various wired telegraph companies and radio stations in Shanghai have issued notices that, starting from August 1st, they will suspend the sending of collect telegrams to the United States, where the recipient pays the fee. As for the reason, at least one company stated that it was due to exchange rate relations. It is also heard that this measure was issued by the head office. A representative of a certain company claimed that this instruction was also implemented in the United States. Therefore, starting from Monday, collect telegrams to China can no longer be sent either. However, the general public still believes that this measure is a unilateral action, because they are worried that the US dollar will fluctuate again.</p>

<h3>Kong Xianrong Asks Various Charities to Maintain the Dependents of His Troops in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Those who serve on the front line can concentrate on serving the country, and those who have no home to return to should not be allowed to die aimlessly. Kong Xianrong, Deputy Commander of Wang Delin's troops, stated that the dependents of the generals have been in Shanghai for a long time. Apart from those who have returned to their original hometowns, there are still some who have no home to return to. Yesterday, he specifically sent a letter to various charities and the Relief Association, asking them to fulfill their original intention and continue to maintain them. The original letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, since the dependents of our department returned to the country from Russia after seeking refuge, we have received generous care from your association, including education and care. They have the joy of living in this room and no sorrow of being homeless. We are grateful for the kindness. However, it has been three months since we arrived in Shanghai. Among them, those who have a home to return to have been informed at any time, and we have sent them travel expenses to return to their hometowns safely. Those who are currently living here, their close family members are either on the front line, determined not to change, and willing to fight the enemy with their lives, or are far away in Xinjiang, restless, and still fulfilling their responsibilities to quell the rebellion and serving the country. Some may be severely disabled, and their lives are uncertain. All of these are special circumstances of our department and are well known to your association. Xianrong is committed to serving the country and cannot think about his family. However, most of the dependents of my troops have no home to return to, and they cannot be allowed to die aimlessly. I feel ashamed and helpless. I have long admired your association's compassionate heart and fulfillment of its original intention. I respectfully attach the above information to the list of dependents and ask for your kind consideration and special arrangements so that the dependents in Shanghai can continue to be maintained, and the officers who are serving can also concentrate on serving the country. Although the matter is very difficult, it is mutually beneficial. Please strongly support it and understand our plight. We are extremely grateful. Sincerely, Kong Xianrong, addressed to the Shanghai Joint Association of Charitable Organizations for Relief of Northeastern Refugees.</p>
<h3>Local Autonomy Promotion Association Petitions for Speedy Implementation of Autonomy</h3>
<p>The preparation for local autonomy in this city has been going on for more than a year, but it has not yet been realized. All sectors of society have high expectations. Therefore, there is an organization of the Local Autonomy Promotion Association to urge the government on the one hand and to publicize widely on the other hand, so that citizens can understand the meaning of autonomy and local autonomy can be completed as soon as possible. Yesterday, the association specially prepared a document to submit to the municipal government, requesting the immediate realization of local autonomy in the city. The original document is recorded as follows: A petition to resume the work of the Autonomy Preparatory Committee and actively handle the city's autonomy. It is hereby stated that the period of political tutelage is the process of constitutionalism, and the implementation of autonomy is an important policy of political tutelage. The city established the Autonomy Preparatory Committee in July last year to plan and proceed in accordance with the Municipal Organization Law. Citizens are watching and hoping that the city's autonomy can be smoothly promoted. Unexpectedly, the progress was slow due to economic relations at first, and then it suddenly stopped due to the impact of the situation. The association believes that the suspension of autonomy in this city has a significant impact. The reasons for not suspending the autonomy are stated as follows: (1) This city is the national political and economic center and is concerned by the international community. Since local autonomy is an important national policy, the city's autonomy should be handled more perfectly than other provinces, counties, and cities to serve as a national example. (2) At present, the rural economy is bankrupt. The reason for the bankruptcy is the reduction in production and the increase in burdens. The reason for the reduction is half due to natural disasters and half due to the war of January 28, which left the land barren. The reason for the increase is half due to the many troubles of the country and half due to the manipulations of local tyrants and evil gentry. The implementation of autonomy can relieve the suffering of farmers and help the revival of rural areas. (3) Shanghai is a place where people from all over the world live together, and the population is dense. In recent years, kidnapping and theft cases have occurred frequently. If autonomy can be implemented, household registration can be handled, and personnel registration can be cleared, then bad people will have nowhere to hide. (4) The city is planning the Greater Shanghai Plan. In the future, all facilities will have close relations with the citizens. If there is no local autonomy agency and local impartial personnel to promote it, it will be difficult to achieve immediate results. Based on the above points, the city's autonomy should be actively held. Even if the city treasury is short of funds, it should be transferred. Moreover, local taxes, local public property, and income stipulated in Article 11 of the National Reconstruction Program have been clearly defined as funds for handling local autonomy. Therefore, we earnestly request your government to immediately resume the work of the Autonomy Preparatory Committee, actively handle the city's autonomy in accordance with the original plan, and submit the document for review to see if it is appropriate. It is for the public good. Sincerely, Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Shoal Discovered in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Near Baimao Sand, the Hydrographic Office of the Naval Department recently received a report that two shoals were discovered near Baimao Sand in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which posed many obstacles to the entry and exit of ships. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched a survey ship to lead survey technicians to carry out sounding. After two days of work, the project was completed. The ship returned to Shanghai yesterday and submitted the sounding charts and water ruler records. The bureau will revise the small map based on the report, set up markers, and issue notices to various ships to pay attention. It is also learned that the bureau's Ganlu survey ship is currently surveying waterways in the Haizhou area and will also return to Shanghai after the project is completed.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Petitions to Stop the Collection of Ship License Fees</h3>
<p>Exposing the malpractices of the ship donation collection office, hoping that the Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus will stop it. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday, which stated that on the 25th of this month, a letter was received from the Timber Industry Association, which stated that according to a letter from Fan Hengliang, the chief representative of North-South merchant ships, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications issued Instruction No. 339 to inform the Commissioner that the Ministry of Communications had issued Instruction No. 781. The bureau submitted a document requesting the transfer of the order to the coastal and river provinces to instruct their subordinates to allow the passage of ships that had already obtained ministry licenses and certificates from various maritime affairs bureaus and were not allowed to collect fees. The document stated that the case had been reported to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications by the representative Fan Hengliang and others for handling, and the ministry had replied to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan and forwarded it to the President, who approved the request and ordered the provincial and municipal governments to comply. Ships with ministry certificates must not be charged license fees again to ensure uniform government orders. Except for waiting for a reply and issuing orders, we hereby inform you, etc. The association found that the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus did not divide their powers according to the ministry's orders, causing the Dongjiadu Ship Registration Office to extort donations for licenses, arbitrarily arrest ship crews, and demand heavy fines. Unable to bear it, the association sent two letters to the association in October and November last year, requesting the association to forward them to the Yuan and Ministry to stop everything. Subsequently, it received a reply stating that it had first sent a letter to the Municipal Government, which had instructed the two bureaus to stop it. Then it received a letter stating that the maritime affairs water police were different matters and should be paid according to the rules. At the same time, the Municipal Government had ordered the two bureaus to instruct the registration donation collection office to handle the matter carefully, etc. Therefore, from last year to the present, the ministry's order has ordered all wooden boats to comply with the rules, obtain licenses, and pay fees. Unexpectedly, the Dongjiadu Ship Registration Donation Collection Office believed that merchant ships could be bullied, abused its powers, and became more severe. When each merchant ship came to Shanghai to report donations, it either claimed that the report was too scribbled or that the license wording was incomplete, and forced them to pay several months of donations in one month, and even detained the crew and forcibly took the customs clearance books, preventing them from making customs declarations. All kinds of threats were used to the extreme, so that merchant ships were in darkness and had no way to redress their grievances. The Fan representative was asked to submit a report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau and forward it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications to appeal for a transfer order to the provincial and municipal governments to stop the double collection. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications have approved the handling, and the Ministry has replied to the Yuan to approve the issuance of an order to the Maritime Affairs Bureau to inform the Fan representative. The Fan representative has taken a photo of the approved order and plans to transfer the order to each wooden boat to hang in the boat and no longer donate again, etc. For this reason, a letter was prepared and attached to the Maritime Affairs Bureau's transfer order and the Ministry's approval photos to the association. The association was requested to forward them to the Municipal Government and transfer them to the Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus, requesting the Dongjiadu Ship Registration Donation Collection Office to stop the execution to avoid causing trouble and to secure the shipping merchants. The association attached two photos of the bureau's approval. The association found that since ships with ministry licenses and maritime affairs bureau licenses had been approved by the Executive Yuan and ordered the provincial and municipal governments to stop collecting license fees again with a unified government order, the Dongjiadu Ship Registration Office in this city should not have the previous extortion and detention of crews to violate the law and harass them. According to the situation in the letter, it is appropriate to attach two photos of the bureau's approval and submit them to your government for review. Please approve the issuance of an order to the Public Utilities and Finance Bureaus to stop the execution. It is for the public good. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Association Plans to Improve Fisheries</h3>
<p>Building fishing grounds in Shanghai, building fishing ports in Shengshan, establishing radio stations and fisheries banks in coastal areas. In order to reorganize fisheries, the Fisheries Improvement Association will actively plan facilities to improve fisheries with the fisheries construction fees collected. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specially met Chen Daoliang, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office of the Ministry of Industry, Jiangsu and Zhejiang District, and inquired about everything. He was immediately met and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3>Collection Issues</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of fisheries construction fee collection, Chen said that in the past, merchants did not understand the content, so there were some disputes in the collection. After the mediation of Yu and Du, there are no problems. At present, the entire ice fresh industry has paid in accordance with the regulations, and although some people in the salted fish industry advocate underwriting, the rest also pay in accordance with the law. However, the collection office will definitely not allow the underwriting issue (the previous report stated that the office plans to recruit merchants to subscribe to the construction fees for imported salted fish, which is completely untrue).</p>
<h3>Used in Fisheries</h3>
<p>The general fisheries merchants believe that the construction fee and the fisheries tax are of the same nature, but in fact they are different. The fisheries tax is collected at 100% of the value, which is the government's income, and the Legislative Yuan has expressly ordered the abolition to show its promotion of fisheries. The construction fee is directly kept by the collection office, and its intention is to collect it from fisheries and use it in fisheries, and to use the collected construction fees to build everything related to fisheries improvement.</p>
<h3>Construction in Progress</h3>
<p>In order to plan fisheries improvement, the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office plans to use the collected construction fees for construction: (1) Building a fisheries market in Shanghai, (2) building a fishing port in Shengshan, (3) building meteorological stations along the coast, (4) establishing radio stations on important ocean surfaces, (5) establishing fisheries banks in important locations, (6) adding ocean-going patrol ships to ensure the safety and welfare of fisheries. It has now been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry has handed it over to the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department for planning, and it is likely to be approved. It is expected to be gradually realized in August and September.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union to Send Personnel to Discuss the Tunan Pension Case Today</h3>
<p>The Tunan victims' families have repeatedly negotiated with the bureau for an increase in pensions, but the matter has not been resolved. Since the bureau sent personnel to negotiate with the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee for a solution, the victims' families have also gone to the meeting to request assistance. Yesterday, the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee appointed Wang Yongchang, Hou Dachun, and Liu Jingcao to go to the bureau this morning to discuss the solution with Liu Hongsheng, but the union is still based on the previous eight principles.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department Sends a Letter to the Public Security Bureau to Detain the Executive Committee Members of the Parasol Industry</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department stated that according to a report from the Organizing Committee of the Parasol Industry Association, it continued to report that the former executive committee members Zhu Chunbo, Lu Zhankui, etc., refused to hand over their duties and requested review and decision. The Municipal Executive Committee issued Instruction No. 1110, stating that the case was reported to the committee, and the committee had forwarded a letter to the Public Security Bureau to detain Zhu Chun and others and order them to hand over their duties. Now, according to the previous report, we will wait for another letter from the Public Security Bureau to handle the matter. We hereby inform you.</p>
<h3>News of Jianglun Encountering Danger</h3>
<p>The Emei Got Off the Shoal. The water in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has gradually receded in recent days, while the flow in the lower reaches is rapid. The China Merchants Bureau's Chongqing liner Emei was sailing down the river from Sichuan this time. The ship loaded a large number of goods and passengers in Chongqing and arrived in Yichang. The ship sailed past Wanxian downstream, and the river water receded, and the water flow was rapid. The Emei ship was immediately aground by the impact of the river tide on the shoal downstream of Wanxian. The hull was broken by an underwater reef. Fortunately, the ship owner quickly took measures to fill the hole and prevent the river water from entering the cabin, and at the same time reversed the car and drove away from the shoal. Yesterday, the bureau received a telegram from the Emei stating that it had escaped danger and was sailing downstream. It is now heard that the crew and passengers who left Yichang are safe and sound. As for the damage to the hull, it will be repaired after the goods are unloaded in Yichang. The loss is not significant.</p>
<h3>Saving the Jian Guo Steamer from Sinking</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jian Guo steamer, recently arrived in Shanghai from Hankou, was fully loaded with cargo and had a large number of passengers. It was also under orders from the company to tow a large iron barge upstream for repairs in Shanghai. This iron barge had a very large capacity. Due to leaks in its hull, the hatches were sealed, and it was towed to Shanghai by the Jian Guo. The day before yesterday, the second major gale struck, originating from Qingdao and sweeping back towards the East China Sea, affecting the Yangtze River as well. As the Jian Guo steamer sailed near Nanjing, it encountered the gale. The wind and waves were especially severe at the Longtan River section. A large wave crashed over the Jian Guo's bridge. Fortunately, it was strongly built and did not sustain unexpected damage. However, the towed iron barge was battered by the strong winds and waves and began to sink into the river. The tow rope was still attached to the Jian Guo, causing the steamer to be pulled as well. The ship's hull swayed violently, creating a dangerous situation. The gale continued unabated, causing great alarm among the crew and passengers. The captain, considering the immense value of the steamer's lives and property, made the resolute decision to cut the tow rope of the iron barge to save the steamer, choosing to abandon the barge and let it sink in the river. The Jian Guo was then able to drop anchor and avert the disaster. However, the situation had been extremely precarious. After the steamer arrived in Shanghai, the captain reported the incident to the head office. It is said that the sunk iron barge was worth tens of thousands of dollars. The company is now planning to find a way to salvage it.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway to Launch Beijing-Zhenjiang Commuter Train</h3>
<p>Starting August 1st, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will implement the 26th upbound and 25th downbound second, third, and fourth class commuter trains between Beijing and Zhenjiang. Previously, this had not been implemented due to issues with rolling stock allocation and passenger transport. It is now learned that the railway, recognizing the needs of passengers, has decided to launch the service starting August 1st. The 26th upbound train will depart from Zhenjiang at 8:40 AM and arrive in Nanjing at 11:30 AM. The 25th downbound train will depart from Beijing at 5:50 PM and arrive in Zhenjiang at 8:15 PM.</p>
<h3>Jiang Kanghu to Lecture on "My Recent Social Thought"</h3>
<p>| This Saturday at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA | Mr. Jiang Kanghu is a pioneer of Chinese social thought, having advocated it tirelessly decades ago. At that time, concepts such as communism were still in their infancy in China. He has traveled extensively around the world, visiting Russia three times. His writings have been widely read by the Chinese people. Later, recognizing the urgent need to bridge Eastern and Western cultures, he accepted an invitation from the Canadian government to head the Chinese Cultural College there for six years. His social thought has become more enriched and substantial through this experience. However, since returning to China, his speeches have not touched upon social thought, a deliberate reticence. Now, after repeated requests from the local YMCA, he has agreed to meet with people in Shanghai at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA this Saturday (the 29th) at 7:30 PM, with a lecture titled "My Recent Social Thought." It is expected that the YMCA will be overcrowded.</p>
<h3>How Did Liu Wanzi Die?</h3>
<p>| Must Await Chemical Examination for Clarity |</p>
<p>After the sudden death of Liu Wanzi, the adopted son of Chen Ada, a gatekeeper at the Nanshi Local Government's Home Industry Society, his spirit possessed his aunt, who recounted grievances, claiming he was poisoned with saltpeter and acid in his tea, leading to his death. These strange events have been reported previously. It is now learned that the coffin was taken to the Zhenru Forensic Institute. During the autopsy, all of the child's teeth had fallen out, his neck was broken, his heart was rotten, and half of his lung was destroyed. The intestinal tract was cut into pieces, but the lower parts, including the genitalia, were intact. However, the specific poisonous substance needs to be identified through chemical analysis, which will take about three to five days. After the examination, the body was still collected by Chen Ada, who also filed a lawsuit, stating that Liu Wanzi was his brother's son. He and his wife, Gong, had been married for sixteen years without any offspring. She had also not conceived previously, so Liu Wanzi was adopted at the age of nine. He was not only an adopted son but also a nephew. The couple treated him as their own child. Wu A-jin and his wife, Yan Sanmao, who are in custody, are not their biological children or stepchildren. They are adopted god-daughters and sons-in-law and are not related. Although they live in the same house, they pay rent. It is not known whether Wu A-jin is suspected. If indeed his son was unjustly killed, he requests a thorough investigation. However, Liu Wanzi had been suffering from a rash and had been treated by a doctor. Unexpectedly, he later bled from his mouth and nose, and the doctor could not cure him, leading to his death, and so on. The authorities have ordered an investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Lu Ganchen Returns to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Ganchen, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Association of the National Youth Association, went to England last autumn to study at Oxford University and to promote Sino-European international friendship. The results were very satisfactory. Now that his work is completed, he arrived in Shanghai from England yesterday (the 27th) on the Blue Funnel Line's Menestheus ship.</p>

<h3>Chen Sufens Belongings Claimed by Daughter Xiangling</h3>
<p>Approved today by the court, the National Commercial Bank will hand over the items belonging to Sufen. Her former husband and elder brother both wished to claim them, but were denied. Xiangling is currently being cared for at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Hong Kong. On the morning of April 16th this year, at 5:00 AM, a young woman's suicide by poison occurred in Room 412 on the fourth floor of the Hua An Building on Jing'an Temple Road. All of the local newspapers at the time reported the incident in detail, and further learned that the young woman's name was Chen Sufen, originally a famous courtesan from Guangdong province, known in the entertainment circle as</p>
<h3>Leng Hong, Also Known as Lei Ya</h3>
<p>She had been married, then returned to prostitution. In the entertainment scene, she was appreciated by Deng Ruiren, the current chairman of the National Commercial Bank and a leading figure in Hong Kong and Guangdong finance. From then on, she lived in luxury, spending every evening with him. Not long after, Sufen gave birth to a daughter, now ten years old, named Xiangling. At that time, Chen seized the opportunity to ask Deng to help her escape from prostitution and live with him. However, Deng already had a wife and was known to be jealous, so the promise of a life together was never fulfilled. But Deng feared that</p>
<h3>His Wife Would Find Out</h3>
<p>He took the opportunity of a business trip to Shanghai to travel</p>
<p>with her in early March, and fearing recognition, Deng stayed in his own villa while Chen stayed at Hua An, meeting him there in secret. On the night of the incident, Deng and Chen had gone to a dance hall together and enjoyed themselves at Hua An, whispering sweet nothings. Chen asked Deng to come up with a thorough solution, but Deng hesitated, causing Sufen to</p>
<h3>Suddenly Feel Sad About Her Life</h3>
<p>She ran into the bathroom and suddenly drank Lysol disinfectant, committing suicide. Deng was shocked when he saw this and tried to save her, but it was too late. He rushed to the Da Dong Hotel and, using a false name, called the Shilong Hospital for help. Dr. Luo Hou from the hospital went to administer aid and injected a stimulant, but the poison had been too strong, and it was ineffective. She died at 10:50 AM on the 16th. Afterwards, Deng was extremely remorseful and, fearing the matter would escalate, he asked his Shanghai friend,</p>
<h3>Yu Zhibo, Who Lives At No. 10, Wanyi Lane, Luban Road</h3>
<p>To come forward as a representative to handle Chen's funeral. However, Chen left behind many belongings, including a Sun Sun savings passbook with 1,500 yuan, 72.25 yuan in cash, a platinum diamond ring, a jade ring, a platinum watch, a seal, three decks of playing cards, a powder puff, ten jars of powder, a lipstick, a pair of glasses, a mirror case, two wooden combs, a pair of scissors, a nail care kit, three handkerchiefs, two towels, a money bag, seven pieces of clothing, a long qipao, a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, a pair of slippers, three books, and a suitcase. These were</p>
<h3>All Collected Intact By The Xin Zha Police Station</h3>
<p>And sent to the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office for safekeeping. Prosecutor Wang Zuze issued a notice for them to be claimed. Recently, there have been rumors that Deng secretly came to Shanghai, and it has been learned that the items belonging to Sufen in the court are to be stored in the National Commercial Bank. The reporter went to the Special District Court Prosecutor's Office yesterday to inquire. It was said that since the deceased Chen Sufen had a biological daughter named Xiangling, who is currently in Hong Kong, according to the provisions of the Civil Law, the daughter has the right to inherit.</p>
<h3>Should Be Claimed By Xiangling</h3>
<p>However, as they did not know her address, they were unable to notify her. Later, they entrusted the Hong Kong Police Commissioner to investigate and locate her. Half a month ago, they received a reply from the Hong Kong Police Department stating that Xiangling is currently living in the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Hong Kong, run by French nuns. However, Xiangling is very young and unable to come to claim the items. The abbess of the convent is also unwilling to be responsible for claiming them on her behalf. Finally, it was suggested that these items be handed over to</p>
<h3>The Shanghai National Commercial Bank</h3>
<p>To be stored and accrue interest until Xiangling finds a suitable guardian or comes to claim them in person. After receiving this reply, the Special District Court Prosecutor's Office considered this arrangement to be very appropriate and reached an agreement with the National Commercial Bank to hand over the remaining money of more than 800 yuan (originally there was more than 1,500 yuan, but 700 yuan was used for the funeral at the International Funeral Home, leaving only this amount) and all the belongings to the Shanghai National Commercial Bank today (the 28th) for safekeeping. It is also learned that Chen Sufen also has</p>
<h3>A Former Husband, Huang Tianyu</h3>
<p>(also known as Huang Ziqi), who is now in Nanyang. He had previously entrusted a lawyer to request the Special District Court to claim these items, but the court denied the request because Huang Tianyu is the deceased's former husband whom she was divorced. Chen Zhi, the deceased's elder brother, had also requested the Special District Court to claim these items, but his request was also rejected. According to a certain gentleman in the Prosecutor's Office, Xiangling is currently being cared for in the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Hong Kong. Before the deceased died, she herself bore all of Xiangling's educational expenses, and afterwards, her sister, Qian Su, bore them.</p>
<h3>New Pudong Early Rice Hits the Market</h3>
<p>Selling For Eight Yuan Ten Cents</p>
<p>The new early rice from Pudong in Shanghai has hit the market yesterday. The rice quality is dry and clean, and the rice color is pure. It sells for eight yuan and ten cents. It is said that there are more than fifty piculs of this rice, transported to Shanghai by the Zhoupu Yitai Trading Company and milled and sold by the Xinchang Rice Mill in Nanshi. Because it is the first of the season, the commodity is scarce and valuable, and various shops are competing to purchase it, making the market quite lively. There is also a large batch of new early rice that will arrive one after another. According to visitors, the weather has been favorable in recent years, resulting in consecutive bumper harvests. This year's new early rice is especially early due to the intercalary leap month in the lunar calendar. It is estimated that each mu (a Chinese unit of land area) can produce about three piculs of grain. If the current hot weather and even rainfall continue, then a bumper crop is to be expected. The current price of grain in the market is said to be three yuan per dan (another Chinese unit of weight).</p>
<h3>The Last Days of Steamer Stewards</h3>
<p>The chief steward of the Xin Ming steamer was dismissed by the company for abuses, and when he dared to resist, he was suppressed by armed force and driven ashore. General Manager Liu Hongsheng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in compliance with the ministry's order to abolish steamer compradores, first implemented the change on the Xin Ming steamer, replacing them with pursers, cargo handlers, and passenger attendants. The old, unbreakable habit of the ship and its business being governed separately for decades was finally broken. After the purser, Chen Wenxin, took over, his first priority was to curb the stewards' arrogance, strictly prohibit the extortion of liquor money, and investigate. There were more than 70 stewards on the Xin Ming steamer. Among them, one or two unscrupulous individuals, unable to demand liquor money from passengers, began to embezzle money from ticket sales. This was discovered by Chen, who reported to Liu, who decided to dismiss the stewards, leading to a major dispute involving a mob beating, resistance to orders to leave the ship, and negotiations with the union. This matter was finally settled yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Reform and Reorganization</h3>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company took back the Xin Ming steamer and took over the cargo handling and passenger attendant affairs, and after the abolition of the comprador system, Liu Hongsheng specially appointed Chen Wenxin as the purser of the ship. Since there was no bad practice of contract fees to be paid, he focused on the cleanliness of the cabins and passenger rooms. The treatment of passengers on board was also gradually improved. For the stewards on the ship, for whom it was not convenient to change the number of positions at once, he also strictly established rules and regulations for management, specifying that liquor money from passengers should not be extorted arbitrarily as before, and that there should be no arrogant behavior. Chen Wenxin brought only one steward with him when he boarded the ship, and the rest were the originally hired people.</p>
<h3>Discovery of Fraud</h3>
<p>The Xin Ming steamer returned to Shanghai from Tianjin last time. At that time, the Yousheng Travel Group chartered the ship to Putuo. When the ship returned to Shanghai, Chen discovered that four of the stewards, including the head steward, were fraudulently embezzling money from passenger tickets. Chen investigated quietly and, on the 26th, when the ship returned to Shanghai, he went to the head office and reported to Liu Hongsheng that he had discovered four fraudulent stewards and asked for instructions. Liu was furious and decided to dismiss these harmful elements to remove obstacles to the reorganization. The company knew that the mid-cabin union often resisted the advance and retreat of these stewards, so General Manager Liu first sent personnel to the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee to explain the situation and to dismiss the four fraudulent stewards, including the head steward, from the Xin Ming steamer. However, the result was not agreed upon.</p>
<h3>Driven Ashore</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, Liu Hongsheng secretly ordered the director of the Nanzhan warehouse to prepare dozens of escorts and send them to the Jinliyuan Wharf to be on guard to prevent the resistance of the fraudulent stewards on the Xin Ming steamer. However, the stewards on the ship, including Jiang Zhigao and Xu Jinzhi, also heard this news and gathered more than 100 people, each carrying weapons, to resist the company's order to leave the ship. At that time, the wharf was suddenly tense, and the police, upon hearing the news, also sent a large number of detectives to suppress them. At about 11:00, the director of the Nanzhan warehouse led the escorts onto the ship and announced General Manager Liu's order to order Jiang Zhigao, Xu Jinzhi, the head steward, and the steward, four people who had been proven to have committed fraud, to go ashore. At first, Xu Jiang and others stubbornly refused to leave the ship and wanted to resort to force. However, seeing the strict security, they did not dare to resist and had to go ashore.</p>
<h3>Union Guarantee</h3>
<p>The Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee also sent a representative, Hou Dachun, to the ship. At that time, he proved that Jiang and Xu had committed the fraud and should be dismissed. There were still two stewards who had no involvement and should not be dismissed together. Hou Dachun came forward to guarantee to the company that these two people would be allowed to return to the ship and resume their duties, and that everything would be done according to the new regulations. As for the fraudulent head stewards Jiang Zhigao and others, it was proposed to send them to court for handling. However, due to the mediation of various parties, the matter was settled with dismissal. A commotion was thus resolved.</p>
<h3>Taking Anger on Others</h3>
<p>After Jiang, Xu, and others were forced to leave the ship and dismissed from their duties, the more than 70 old stewards on the ship rose up in debt. While the company personnel were leaving the ship, they took their anger on Ying Yun, the new steward hired by Chen Wenxin, and beat him severely all over his body. Under the general beating, the stewards even intended to push him into the Huangpu River. At that time, Ying was seriously injured and unable to resist. His upper body had already been pushed out of the deck railing, and he was about to fall into the water. Fortunately, a water patrolman caught sight of him and rushed to rescue him, stopping the crowd. Ying was saved from falling into the river, but he was still seriously injured and was sent to the hospital yesterday for treatment.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Fine</h3>
<p>When the ship was exporting last time, the steward secretly carried a parcel. The inspector discovered it and stepped forward to stop him. The steward refused and beat the inspector. It was reported to the Nanzhan warehouse, and the Water Patrol Team arrested the violent steward. Yesterday, the court ruled that the steward was guilty of carrying smuggled goods and beating the inspector, and fined him 210 yuan, ordering him to pay the fine and be released.</p>
<h3>Flood Control Amidst Falling River Levels</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the Engineering Office of the National Economic Council stated that the main dikes on the southern bank of Jianli are in good condition. Since yesterday, the water has receded by about a foot. Personnel have been assigned to protect the main dikes from Majiazui to Zhanghuagang and the Tianxing horizontal dike, and sufficient materials have been prepared, so there is no cause for concern. However, the riverbanks are prone to collapse during receding water, so inspections must be carried out several times a day. Above the Dongda Dyke and above the Huangshuitao to Tugang, there are small groups of bandits appearing occasionally, so patrols can only be carried out during the day, and so on. The current water level situation is attached below:</p>

<h3>All Merchants and Vendors on Jiangyin Street Resolutely Oppose the Nanzhan Road Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>| Chief Representatives Unable to Cope |</p>
<p>The construction of the vegetable market on Nanzhan Road has caused panic and opposition among all merchants and vendors on Jiangyin Street. Zhu Jinbao, Fan Gongliang, Yan Hongxiang, Yu Miaofa, and Xu Chunhua were elected as chief representatives to petition various agencies to withdraw the order, but it has not been resolved. Yesterday, after the vegetable market closed, merchants and vendors gathered spontaneously, numbering about 200, and went to the residences of the five chief representatives to ask about the progress and the reasons why it had not been resolved. Zhu Jinbao, the chief representative, gently persuaded the vendors and merchants, saying that the case is currently under review by the Finance Bureau's Vegetable Market Construction Committee, and that it is generally hoped that they will comply with our reasons for petition and that a satisfactory resolution will be reached. He asked everyone to return home in peace. However, a few of the vendors were aggressive and almost clashed with the chief representatives. Fortunately, the other four representatives, Fan Gongliang and others, dispersed them. Therefore, if this case is not resolved satisfactorily, it is feared that it will arouse public anger. It is not known whether the authorities will cancel the construction.</p>
<h3>Fengxiang and Huian Collide</h3>
<p>Both Ships Reversed But Could Not Avoid Collision</p>
<p>The Fengxiang steamer of the Taifeng Company in Shanghai collided with the Huian steamer of the Zhengji Company yesterday due to the rapid tide. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Collision Due to Rapid Current</h3>
<p>The Fengxiang steamer of the Taifeng Company arrived in Shanghai from Shantou with more than 300 tons of cargo. At 2:30 PM yesterday, it arrived in the Huangpu River, approaching the Yuanyi Wharf near Yangjiadu. At that time, the tide was very strong, and the Fengxiang was advancing with the current. At this time, the Huian steamer of the Zhengji Company, which was fully loaded with cargo at the Yuanyi Wharf, was turning around to set sail. Its stern was across the river. The Fengxiang steamer was advancing in the rapid current. The first mate of the Fengxiang sounded a warning horn and reversed, intending to go around the stern of the Huian. However, the Huian steamer also reversed at that time, resulting in the inability to avoid a collision. The bow of the Fengxiang struck the left side of the bow of the Huian. The bow of the Huian was dented, but the damage was light.</p>
<h3>Fengxiang Damaged</h3>
<p>The Fengxiang steamer, unable to avoid the collision, continued to sail towards the center of the river because there were many fishing boats moored on the Puxi side. Unexpectedly, when the Huian steamer untied its bow lines and turned its hull, the Huian's hull had already turned, and its bow was facing the Fengxiang. This resulted in a second violent collision. With a loud crash, the left side of the bow of the Fengxiang steamer was struck a hole by the Huian steamer, and the stairs and other items on the deck were completely destroyed. The loss was greater than that of the Huian steamer. After the two ships collided, they each docked at the wharf. The Huian remained at the Yuanyi Wharf, and the Fengxiang stopped at the Hongsheng Warehouse.</p>
<h3>Huian Halted</h3>
<p>After the incident, both sides reported to their companies. The Zhengji Company, upon hearing the news, said that since the Huian steamer was fully loaded with cargo, and it was not yet known whether there was any other damage after the collision with the Fengxiang, they did not dare to export rashly, fearing danger. They immediately returned to the Yuanyi Wharf and stopped sailing, pending inspection before resuming.</p>
<h3>Fengxiang Unloads Cargo</h3>
<p>The Fengxiang steamer suffered more damage from the collision with the Huian than the Huian itself. Moreover, the Fengxiang was impacted by the rapid tide during this collision, and the hull could not retreat. The stern of the Huian was also stopped across the river, and the Puxi side was full of moored civilian boats. Therefore, the responsibility for the accident still needs to be investigated, but it does not seem to be the Fengxiang's fault. The shipowner has reported to the company and will unload the cargo before inspecting the damage and repairing the hole.</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Association Releases Report on Charity Dance Proceeds</h3>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association held a charity dance at the Yiyuan to raise funds and promote child welfare. The results were very satisfactory. A report was prepared by the honorary accountant of the dance, Mr. Fei Wusheng, which was reviewed by the executive committee of the association and by two committee members, Mr. Lin Kanghou, general manager of the Bankers Association, and Mr. Zhao Jinqing, general manager of the Tongyi Silver Company, who were responsible for verifying the accounts. They found the report to be accurate. The dance's financial report is as follows: Income: (1) Dance tickets: 8,995 yuan; (2) Advertising fees: 3,134.59 yuan; (3) Auction and donations: 2,098 yuan; (4) Raffle tickets: 3,930 yuan; Total income: 18,157.59 yuan. Expenses: (1) Yiyuan dance hall meal expenses: 1,191 yuan; (2) Refund of advertising fees: 38.25 yuan; (3) Raffle tickets: 40 yuan; (4) Remittance fees: 4.90 yuan; (5) Order forms and posters printed by the Mei Lingdeng: 288.14 yuan; (6) Flowers: 54 yuan; (7) Zhu Jintang printing fees: 12 yuan; Total expenses: 1,628.29 yuan. In summary, after deducting all expenses, the net profit of the dance was 16,529.30 yuan. It is reported that these funds have been fully handed over to the Child Welfare Association by Mr. Fei Wusheng, general manager of the Foreign YMCA.</p>
<h3>Thugs Falsely Accuse the Innocent</h3>
<p>Civil Servants are Utilized by Such Types, All Boatmen Are Deeply Worried</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a trend where wicked thugs, after being caught, arbitrarily make false accusations against the innocent and those they dislike. If public officials are not careful, they may be utilized by these individuals to vent their anger. Merchants and people dare to be angry but dare not speak out. A few days ago, after the police station of the Triangle Land Concession in the British Concession caught the fugitives Wu Genfa (also known as Ma Shuangding) and Wang Zigen (also known as Lu Zigen), the suspects made wild accusations, implicating boatman Cao Jinbing, who was frequently detained and questioned for about eight days before being released. The thugs stated that there are many boatmen in this area, mostly in the Pudong area, and that they would make false accusations one by one, causing them to suffer the pain of being detained and questioned. Therefore, all boatmen are deeply worried, and some unscrupulous people are secretly extorting money from various boatmen.</p>
<h3>The National Arts and Acrobatic Troupe Will Perform and the War Zone Relief Association Sells Tickets</h3>
<p>Since the War Zone Disaster Relief Association signed a contract with the Chinese National Arts and Acrobatic Troupe to perform at a selected site, they are currently preparing the stage and ticket sales. The issuance of tickets is quite busy. The following is a copy of the letter sent to leaders and representatives of various groups, along with the enclosed tickets:</p>
<p>Respected Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>Tracing back to the time when the brutal Japanese occupied our Northeast and invaded Rehe, the natural barrier of the Great Wall was completely lost, and the overall situation in Peiping and Tianjin was in grave danger. The government painfully sought complete peace and signed a ceasefire agreement. Patriotic people were deeply concerned about saving the country and were still fighting in bloody battles. The people's army in Chahar Province had courageously advanced and recovered Dolon and Liaodong. The brave soldiers were achieving surprising victories and fiercely eliminating the Japanese pirates. However, with the great enemy at hand, urgent assistance was needed. We hoped to fulfill the responsibility of rescuing the dying and aiding the wounded amidst the rain of bullets. The people in the war zone have suffered greatly from the trampling, being displaced and yearning for relief. Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in a peaceful land feel sympathy for the disaster victims and should provide assistance together. Collecting funds is our inescapable duty. Now, the Chinese National Arts and Acrobatic Troupe has arrived in Shanghai after performing in Hong Kong. The troupe leader, Sun Fugang, has gathered national arts experts and extensively stocked tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, and talents who can do what others cannot and have what others do not have. Their art is outstanding, and their reputation is widely praised. This is a rare opportunity that will not come again. Therefore, we are temporarily using the square opposite the Great World on Avenue Edward VII to host performances for half a month, promoting national arts through entertainment and embodying relief through entertainment. We hope that wise officials, social elites, noble ladies, and business giants will drive from afar and come together in droves, the more the better, to stimulate patriotic fervor and rescue the people from the abyss of suffering. Enclosed are tickets, and we respectfully request your generous acceptance or assistance in selling them, so that we can gather the strength of thousands and contribute to the cause, benefiting all. Your kindness will be forever remembered.</p>
<h3>Chen Baofu, the Kidnapper in the Lin Weiqing Case, Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>丨Original Sentence of Life Imprisonment Upheld丨</p>
<p>Lin Weiqing, brother of Lin Biao, President of the Jiangsu High Court, lived at 55 Rue Pére Huc. On the night of February 8, 1931, at 11:30 PM, Lin returned home in his own car. Just as he arrived at the entrance of his residence, he was suddenly encountered by several kidnappers who intended to kidnap him. Lin, being alert, escaped at that time. Subsequently, on May 2 of this year, Shi Huanting, a Chinese detective from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, arrested Chen Baofu, a native of Qingjiang, one of the kidnappers in the case, at the intersection of Hart Road and Jing'an Temple Road. He was handed over to the First Special District Local Court. The initial trial sentenced Chen to life imprisonment. Chen, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. During the court hearing, Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer for the police station at the time, argued that the evidence against Chen for kidnapping Lin Weiqing was conclusive and that the initial judgment was already lenient. Therefore, he requested that the original judgment be upheld and the appeal be rejected. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhao and Jiang, ascended the bench to announce the judgment: Chen Baofu's appeal was rejected.</p>
<h3>Assassination of Zhang Xinshan Case Transferred to the Second Special District Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Zhang Xinshan, a secret agent No. 69 of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team, a native of Anhui, nicknamed "Little Anhui," was 29 years old this year. He lived alone in No. 8 Zhenhua Lane, Baile Ni Meng Ma Lang Road, French Concession. At 8:45 AM on the 5th of this month, when he left his residence and passed the entrance of Lane 1, Chongyi Lane, Baile Ni Meng Ma Lang Road, he was suddenly stabbed to death by three enemies with random knives. The murderers fled the scene. Subsequently, the French police transported the body to the morgue for examination, and the court verified the cause of death. The body was collected by the family. The Public Safety Bureau and the police station investigated the murderers. On the third day after the incident, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team, together with detectives from the French police station, arrested the main culprits, Li Decai, Guo Shanyu, and Guo Yushan, all natives of Anhui, at three locations: Ronghua Inn and the rear of Pudong Guanghua Kerosene Depot on Mintini Yin Road, and No. 379 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu. After preliminary interrogation by Detective Team Leader Ying, Li and others confessed to jointly committing the murder and killing Zhang without denying it. Since the defendants' crime scene was in the French Concession, it should be tried by the Concession court. The day before yesterday, Team Leader Lu sent detectives to escort the three criminals, Li and others, to the French police station for detention. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the police station transferred the three criminals, Li and others, to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court. Acting Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the trial. First, Yao Zhaodi, the police station lawyer, stated the case, roughly saying that the defendants were the murderers who killed Zhang Xinshan, a secret agent of the Public Safety Bureau. The case has been sent by the Public Safety Bureau, but the police station has not yet investigated the case. He requested a postponement of one week to investigate and prosecute. The court verified the report and briefly interrogated the three defendants. Then, it was ordered to postpone the trial to August 1. The defendants were returned to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3>Verdicts in the Wang Delin Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Wang Delin, the nine-year-old son of Wang Gaosun, a famous architect from Ningbo, residing at No. 2 Dafeng Lane, Huanlong Road, French Concession, was kidnapped by kidnappers at 5:00 AM on December 28 of last year and hidden. A huge ransom was demanded. In April of this year, the Public Concession police cracked the kidnappers' den at No. 511 Hong'an Lane, Laobazi Road, rescued the hostage, and arrested Wang Yuanwei, Zhang Xiaomao, Yao Sheng, Madam Xiang, Shi Yushi, Madam Shen, and suspect Qian Ziming, a total of eighteen men and women. It was found that Wang and others had also committed kidnapping cases in the Public Concession, so they were first sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. After the judgment, the French police transferred Wang and the other eighteen people to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. After investigation, it was found that twelve people, including Qian Ziming, were not involved in the case. The police did not prosecute and were ordered to release them and send them back to the First Special District Court for disposal. Wang and the other six men and women had already been interrogated by Judge Li Changnian, and the confessions had been recorded in previous reports. The trial was resumed a few days ago. After the police investigated and found that Shi Yushi was not involved in the case, the court ordered her release. Madam Xiang was hospitalized for childbirth and was dealt with separately. Wang, Zhang, Yao, and Madam Shen are now at the end of trial. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, Judge Li presided over the Criminal Division 1, ordering Wang and others to be brought to court. Wang Yuanwei was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment for kidnapping and demanding ransom, and deprived of civil rights for twenty years. Zhang Xiaomao and Yao Sheng were each sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment for kidnapping and demanding ransom, and each deprived of civil rights for sixteen years. The number of days detained before the judgment was determined to be two days equal to one day of imprisonment. Madam Shen was found not guilty. After the verdict, Wang, Zhang, and Yao were transferred to the detention center. Madam Shen was returned to detention during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>The Luodian Case of Murdering One's Husband</h3>
<p>Pitifully, a woman who met the wrong person fell into sin. Lu Qixiang, a villager from Jiapaiqiao Township, southeast of Luodian Town, which is along the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus route, was stabbed sixteen times by his wife. Someone reported the incident to the Luodian Town Public Security Sub-bureau of Baoshan County. The director, Gong Zanyao, dispatched police to rush to the scene and rescued the injured person, taking him back to the Luodian Town China Red Cross branch hospital for treatment. At the same time, Lu's wife was taken to the sub-bureau. Later, due to the severity of the injuries, he was transferred to Shanghai. It is learned that Lu Qixiang died due to excessive injuries at the China Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road. An investigation into the details revealed that the deceased's wife, Lu Zhao, whose maiden name was Wan, lived about six li southeast of Luodian Town. The route was winding and rickshaws could not pass. There were seven people in the Lu family: Lu Xu (the deceased's biological mother), who was 61 years old, followed by the deceased and the deceased's wife, Lu Wan. Wan had been married to Lu for more than ten years and had given birth to three sons and two daughters. The eldest daughter was married and only the second daughter, aged fifteen, and the third son, aged thirteen, remained at home. The youngest son, aged eight, had been adopted by others due to the family's financial difficulties. Wan and her mother-in-law, Xu, did not get along very well. Lu Qixiang was fond of gambling and often wandered outside, not engaged in proper business. The family had more than thirty mu of farmland, which he had sold off. Clothing and items were pawned off completely. Usually, Wan obtained support from her mother's family or from relatives and friends. Because Wan was older than her husband, she often advised her husband to change his ways and improve, but to no avail. Therefore, recently, she often quarreled with her husband. A few days ago, she had a quarrel with the deceased. Because she could no longer bear it, she took this drastic measure of murdering her husband, intending to risk her life with Lu. Therefore, she secretly took a foot-long kitchen knife, sharpened it in advance, and waited for Lu to fall asleep. She planned to chop off his fingers first, as a warning against gambling. That night, Wan slept on the bed in the room, while Lu lay on a small bed outside. After Lu was hurt, he woke up and tried to take Wan's knife. Therefore, Wan violently chopped him sixteen times, one on the upper right ear and one on the left arm, which were the most severe, breaking the arm bone. The rest of his shoulders, back, hands, and feet were covered in blood. By the time the police from the Public Security Sub-bureau arrived at the scene, Lu had become a bloody figure. However, he was still able to walk. After the Public Security Bureau took Wan to the sub-bureau, she initially refused to admit to injuring her husband, only saying that Lu wandered outside and did not care about family matters. After repeated questioning, she admitted to stabbing him only once, and claimed that her husband told her to stab him and that she really didn't know why. When she spoke, her nerves seemed stimulated. After the interrogating officer verified the confession, Lu Wan, along with the murder weapon, was handed over to the Baoshan County government for trial the day before yesterday. It is learned that the case is now being prosecuted by Lu Yuwen (aged 54), the deceased's paternal uncle, who has filed a complaint with the county government.</p>
<h3>Five Uninvited Guests Suddenly Arrive at the Residence of Central Committee Member Huang Jilu</h3>
<p>One of them was carrying a handgun. Huang Jilu, a member of the Central Committee, lived at No. 44, Model Village, Avenue Albert, French Concession, Shanghai. Around 7 PM the night before last, five burly men suddenly broke into Huang's residence. One of them was carrying a handgun. Upon entering, they immediately asked where Huang was. The family members, seeing the situation, knew that something was wrong and replied that Huang had gone to Putuo for sightseeing a few days ago. The five men left angrily upon hearing this. As they left, they declared to Huang's family, "We are not here to kidnap or assassinate, but just to borrow some money from Mr. Huang to spend." After saying this, they left together. Afterwards, the police station heard about the incident and immediately sent detectives to investigate. They found the matter very strange. If the five men were a gang of thieves, why didn't they search the residence after entering? The reason is unknown. The police station has now increased surveillance around Huang's residence.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Hearing of the Case of Wenying's Mother Accusing Diao'aoke and Others</h3>
<p>丨Verdict to be Announced on August 1丨</p>
<p>Since his female disciple Wenying was murdered by Fan Hongsheng, astrologer Cheng Meixian (also known as Diao'aoke) has been involved in various suspicions. His ex-wife Cheng Lingqing (also known as Jiang Lingqing) and Feng Mengyun, the editor of the Da Jing Bao, were accused by Wenying's mother, Huang Wushi, of obstructing public morals and disrupting the family, and filed an incidental private lawsuit, demanding that Cheng Meixian pay compensation of 36,000 yuan. The first instance ruled the defendants not guilty and rejected the incidental private lawsuit. Huang Wushi was not satisfied and, through her lawyer, appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The hearing had already commenced once. Yesterday morning, Judges Zhao, Zhou, and Jiang continued the hearing. Shen Mingshan and Meng Aisheng, two tea waiters from the Great China Hotel and the New Huizhong Inn, were summoned to court to testify whether Cheng Meixian and his wife had brought Wenying to the hotels under the pretext of fortune-telling, while in reality engaging in secret prostitution. The answers of the two tea waiters were mostly irrelevant. However, they admitted that Cheng and others had attached a photo of the female physiognomist to leaflets and distributed them to guests in the rooms, which was true. The court said that this must be to have the guests see her face first, and then she would go to see people's faces. Then, after questioning Huang Wushi, Cheng Meixian, and others one by one, the lawyers for both sides were ordered to conclude their arguments. It was already past 1 PM. The court announced that the verdict would be announced on August 1.</p>

<h3>Laborer Crushed to Death While Digging a Mound in Tangjiawan</h3>
<p>Behind the White Cloud Temple in Tangjiawan, Ximen, Nanshi, there is a large open space with a mound about ten feet high. Recently, the landowner planned to build a house there and hired six laborers yesterday morning around 8:00 AM to level the mound. Because the mound was very high, the laborers began digging from the bottom of the mound. Unexpectedly, too much soil was removed from the bottom, and a huge hole was formed in an instant. The laborers did not pay attention and continued to dig. As a result, the upper part lost its support and suddenly collapsed. Fortunately, four of the six people were carrying the dug-out mud elsewhere, so only two people were crushed in the hole. After they were discovered and pulled out, Fan Dejun, 41 years old, a native of Yancheng, died on the spot due to being crushed in a vital area. Another person named Xiao Qingyuan was slightly injured and was sent to the hospital. Someone reported the incident to the Second District General Office, which immediately ordered the local constable to report to the local court for inspection.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper's local news section about the prison officials of the Second Special District Jail fighting in the office. After investigation, this is not in line with the facts. In addition to the fact that the dismissed warden Gong Hanbin insulted and beat public officials and obstructed official duties, our jail has sent a letter to the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, requesting that it be investigated and dealt with according to law. Right and wrong will be resolved by law. However, the article stated that "[Since Warden Sun took office, just twenty days ago, he has replaced the old staff, guards, and security personnel, and appointed more than thirty private individuals," which is absolutely not true. After Warden Sun took office, he never lightly changed the old staff. Except for Chief Wardens Huang Rongxi and Chen Zhaojie, who repeatedly requested resignation and were approved, and Warden Heng Yuan, who voluntarily requested dismissal, and Warden Liu Yuhou, who was found to have purchased and delivered cigarettes for prisoners and was dismissed after being reported by the department and verified, no other person has been changed. The facts are there and can be verified. We have always admired your newspaper's commitment to justice, so we specially send this letter to request that you investigate and correct the facts to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Second Special District Jail of Jiangsu</p>
<p>July 27</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>We have learned that on July 25, the local news columns of various newspapers reported that the First Special District Citizens' Federation was soliciting reports of unscrupulous merchants, and that more than a thousand cases had been reported by various parties. In addition to several cases that have already been dealt with, there are more than ten cases under investigation, and our factory is also listed among them. This is not in line with the facts. Our factory is a pioneer in the domestic enamel industry and has a reputation both domestically and internationally. It has made great contributions to resisting enemy goods. In the past, the printing paper, mandarin orange pots, boiler stoves, enamel powder, etc., used by our industry were all enemy goods. After careful research by our factory, they were invented and manufactured successively, and supplied to the same industry. Anyone who knows the situation of the enamel industry is familiar with it. The fourth issue of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Commercial Monthly this year has a more detailed description of the enamel industry, which can be reviewed. Since September 18, we have not purchased any enemy goods, even a nail or a piece of iron. The reported sections are obviously due to misunderstanding. In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Federation to conduct a prompt investigation, we hereby request that your newspaper, with its heart of protecting domestic goods, grant a disclosure to dispel public doubts. We are deeply grateful for your public spirit.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>China Yifeng Enamel Co., Ltd.</p>

(2) Cleaning Work: Cleaning up accumulated garbage, approximately 3,716 tons. (3) Epidemic Prevention Injections: Preventing epidemics in war zones is extremely important, and the weather after the war is gradually getting hotter, making it easier for them to occur. The Hygiene Bureau should send personnel to expand the implementation of preventive injections, a total of 236,333 injections, so fortunately a major epidemic was avoided after the soldiers. (4) Free Medical Treatment: After the war, three free mobile clinics were set up, each with one doctor and one nurse. From July 20, 1932, to the end of 1932, a total of 139 clinic days were held, with over 37,800 consultations. It is still being carried out. (5) Disinfection: After the war, bleaching powder was used to disinfect garbage accumulation sites, messy feces sites, dirty stagnant water sites, and places where corpses were found. (6) Inspecting Livestock. (7) Assisting in the Establishment of Temporary Epidemic Hospitals: Local people in the Jiangwan District raised funds to set up a temporary epidemic hospital and provided subsidies. (B) Matters in Progress (1) Reviving the Wusong Hygiene District: This district is a model for promoting hygiene in various districts of this city in the future, and it is very important to restore it urgently. In addition to allocating 32,000 yuan from the Inter-Race Horse Racing Relief Fund to assist in its revival, the Hygiene Bureau and Tongji University will also formulate cooperation measures and raise considerable funds to facilitate its revival. The funding has now been raised and houses are being built, including a hygiene district office, a free clinic, and a hospital. (2) Assisting in the Complete Restoration of China's Public Hospitals: Allocating 10,000 yuan from the Inter-Race Horse Racing Relief Fund's extra surplus to facilitate complete restoration. (3) Assisting in the Restoration of Jiangwan Hospital: This hospital is very important in Jiangwan. Allocating 3,000 yuan from the Inter-Race Horse Racing Relief Fund to facilitate restoration. (4) Reviving the Zhabei Clinic: This is a free clinic, and the Post-War Relief Committee has allocated a subsidy of 10,000 yuan. Plans for its revival are currently underway. (5) Planning to Establish a Municipal Hospital: Reserving an area of ​​over 87 mu of land north of Qiujiang Road, east of Funan Zuo Road, south of Fudong Wai Road, and west of Huayuan Road for the construction of a municipal hospital. Preparations are currently underway to invite experts with experience in hospital construction to jointly plan the construction plan, and construction can begin after the plan is drafted and approved. (6) Improving Garbage Disposal Equipment: Designating 100,000 yuan for improving equipment, and the Hygiene and Public Works Bureaus are discussing the construction plan. In short, the post-war revival of the war zone in this city involves a vast amount of work, which cannot be reported in a short period of time. However, this matter is of great importance. One reason is the limited financial resources of the municipal government, and the other is the urgent need to nurture and develop people's livelihoods. Therefore, various construction projects can only be carried out gradually. In the future, we hope that all compatriots will assist the municipal government to achieve complete success. (The End)</p>

<h3>A Pseudo-Organization Like the Pacific Society Must Not Be Allowed to Join</h3>
<p>The Pacific International Society is scheduled to open in Banff, Canada from August 14th to 27th. Our country's representatives, Hu Shi and others, have already gone to attend. It is known that the conference will discuss many cases, but the Northeast Incident, which must be discussed and decided by the Order Committee of each country, is the most important case to be discussed at the conference. Other cases concerning economics and politics will also be brought up for discussion. As for the rumors that the pseudo-organization will also send representatives to attend the conference, it is factually impossible. This is because, not only according to the regulations of the conference, any new member country requesting to join must be approved by all member countries, but also the League of Nations has unanimously passed a resolution not to recognize the pseudo-organization. The League of Nations subcommittee also has many resolutions regarding the refusal of the pseudo-organization to participate in international organizations. This time, the Japanese representatives to the Pacific International Society will not rashly propose it either.</p>

A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited Jiang at his residence and discussed his return to China as follows.</p>
<h3>Lecturing in the United States</h3>
<p>Dr. Jiang said first, "I took a boat to Canada in the summer of 1927 to lecture, with the aim of promoting Chinese culture and bridging Chinese and Western scholarship. I was then hired by McGill University to serve as the president of the Chinese College and the director of the Oriental Literature Department of the Parliamentary Library. There are more than 110 universities in the United States, and Chinese literature occupies more than 400 academic fields, which shows the importance that Europe and the United States attach to Chinese literature. Most of the teachers in this field are Americans, and their qualifications are limited to teaching assistants or lecturers. In the past seven years, I was the only one who served as a full professor. This is not to boast of my abilities, but also to show the importance attached to Chinese literature, and this kind of professorship is not easy to find."</p>
<h3>The Journey Back to China</h3>
<p>Dr. Jiang continued, "The years in the United States have passed quickly. After the January 28th Incident in China, the Japanese became more and more rampant. I missed my motherland and felt deeply saddened. Moreover, my family has been living in Beiping for a long time, and the thought of my hometown arose spontaneously. Therefore, I decided to return to China. I requested the school authorities to grant me leave to return to China. At that time, the school authorities valued the college affairs and firmly retained me. It was not until this year that the McGill University Academic Affairs Committee approved my annual leave, so I set off from Montreal in mid-June, passing through the University of British Columbia, where I taught for two weeks. At the same time, the University of California and the University of Hawaii also invited me to give lectures, so I did not arrive in Shanghai until the 22nd of this month. The ship I took was the Grand President of the Dollar Steamship Lines."</p>
<h3>No Other Missions</h3>
<p>When the reporter asked Jiang if he had any special missions in Shanghai, he said that this return to Shanghai was purely to visit his relatives and take a short rest, and there were no other special missions. In recent days, he has been giving lectures in turn at the invitation of the local Association of Chinese Students in America, the Institute of International Studies, and the YMCA. He will leave Shanghai in four or five days to go to Pingjin to visit his relatives, and he plans to travel to Putuo, Qingdao, or Sichuan and Yunnan. Although I have been abroad for many years and do not ask about state affairs, I still indirectly promote Chinese culture. If the Chinese authorities need me to serve directly, I will not refuse."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education Elementary School Education Experiment Research Association</h3>
<p>Next Semester's Research Focuses on Civic Training. In order to promote the efficiency of elementary school education experiments, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education organized the Elementary School Education Experiment Research Association last semester, dividing it into eight groups and assigning various municipal schools to take charge of various experimental issues in education. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. It is reported that the small problem experiment group has previously designated six schools. In addition to Yangzheng and Bide schools, which must continue the experiment next semester, the First Experimental Elementary School, He'an, Qimei, and Qiuzhi schools have all submitted reports to the bureau. The remaining seven groups, including central education, subject education curriculum and materials, testing materials, teaching aids, life guidance, and administrative affairs, all focus on health as the research center. The results have been fully exhibited at the Health Education Exhibition and are now being sorted out in preparation for printing. As for the work of the association next semester, it has been decided to use civic training as the experimental research center, which will be planned and carried out by the bureau.</p>
<h3>Overview of National Tongji University</h3>
<p>National Tongji University in Wusong has been established for 26 years. It is divided into two colleges, medicine and engineering, and is well-managed and has excellent results. Since the January 28th Incident, many of the buildings and equipment have been destroyed. Last year, President Hu Shuhua resigned, and the National Government appointed Weng Zhilong to succeed Hu. Since taking office, he has made great efforts to rectify the situation, and great progress has been made. The recent situation of the school is described below.</p>
<p>(1) The College of Medicine's Revitalization of Rural Areas is the Most Important Endeavor in Our Country's Internal Affairs, and the relationship between rural economy and farmers' health is very important. Without healthy farmers, all rural undertakings will not progress. Therefore, Western countries attach great importance to farmers' health. The school is located in Wusong, and the surrounding areas are all rural. It has specially consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to find ways to restore the previous health district in the area. With the assistance of Mayor Wu and Director Li, this initiative was successful. Four million yuan was used as the district's expenses (shared by the municipal government and Tongji). Dr. Li Xuanguo was hired as the director of the district, and the groundbreaking ceremony for the Health District Office (including a hospital) was held on July 1st. It will be completed in August or September. Students in the school's public health department can practice here, and can also take this opportunity to go to people's homes to conduct on-site investigations and diagnose diseases, so that students can develop a spirit of equality and engage in real national salvation work. In terms of research, great efforts have also been made. Recently, graduates have been selected to study in the health research classes run by the Nanjing Health Department and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau. During the summer vacation, doctors and teaching assistants are sent to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital Health Office, Hebei Dingxian (model county), Nanjing Health Department Central Hospital and other places for investigation, in order to provide specialized research for reference.</p>
<p>(2) The College of Engineering's factory buildings and machines that have been destroyed have mostly been repaired. Recently, various machines have been shipped from Germany, and it is planned to build an industrial museum when funds are available to display all the machine models for reference and research. In order to meet the needs of the country, a hydraulic experiment hall has been built, which has been completed and can be equipped during the summer vacation for practical use. Since the January 28th Incident, the economy has been so difficult, but it is still commendable to be able to do so.</p>
<p>(3) The Affiliated High School plans to pay attention to the selection of teaching materials and methods in teaching next semester, and will also make special improvements in moral education, in order to cultivate useful talents for the country and promote the inherent spirit of the nation. After President Weng arrived at the school, he obtained the former Central University Medical College buildings, repaired them, and planned to add dormitories and classrooms to be used as the affiliated high school buildings. All new students next year can live there.</p>
<p>(4) Senior Vocational School. All the buildings and machines of the Jiangwan Labor University, which has been discontinued, have been allocated to Tongji for application after being approved by the Labor University Board of Directors and passed by the Central Political Conference. The Ministry of Education has ordered the transfer. The school has now decided to open a senior vocational school, hiring Tang Ying, the former dean of the College of Engineering of Labor University, as the director, and establishing three specialized departments: mechanical, civil, and textile, to cultivate a kind of secondary industrial talent for practical production. New students are now being recruited.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Examines New Students Today</h3>
<p>The Student Self-Government Association Sends Personnel to Assist and Guide. The situation of National Jinan University's recruitment of new students this year has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the school will start examining mainland new students at 8:00 AM on the 28th of this month in Zhiyuan Hall, until 4:00 PM on the 29th. The school's admissions committee has been very thorough in preparing for the examination venue, student meals, rest, clothing storage, and temporary medical care. The school's student self-government association has specially organized a guidance office for candidates to assist the school's admissions committee. More than 20 instructors have been hired and have been providing guidance since the 23rd of this month. They have been sincerely answering all inquiries from candidates. Many instructors have been dispatched today to provide guidance at all times. There is even more detailed guidance on the application matters for overseas Chinese students. The school's admissions committee has printed the "Candidate Instructions" and distributed them to all candidates, indicating the points that should be paid attention to. After the candidates arrive at the school, before entering the examination venue, they should first obtain the following from the candidate guidance office: (1) Examination Venue Instructions, (2) Examination Venue Seating Chart, (3) Examination Venue Seating Arrangement Map. The examination venue seats are changed every morning and afternoon, and reports are provided at any time. In order to facilitate the candidates' travel, the school's admissions committee has specially negotiated with the China General Omnibus Company to provide special express buses, which will depart from Zhaohui Road to the school gate in Zhenru at 6:30 AM on the 28th and 29th, once every ten minutes. If there are too many people, temporary buses will be added. In addition, there will be more vehicles available at the school gate from 4:00 PM to take the candidates back to Shanghai to avoid waiting.</p>
<h3>Tai Shuangqiu Appointed Dean of the Daxia College of Education</h3>
<p>Dr. Chen Xuanzhen, Dean of the College of Education of Daxia University, resigned at the end of August of this year to take the position of Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The school has appointed Dr. Tai Shuangqiu as the successor Dean of the College of Education. Dr. Tai is a PhD in Philosophy from Columbia University in the United States. He has served as the principal of Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Middle School, the Dean of Academic Affairs of the Guangxi Educational Administrative Personnel Training Institute, and the professor of education at National Central, Zhongshan, Jinan and Henan Universities for many years. He has also served as a professor at Daxia University for one year. He is known for his high academic standing and rich writings. He has special research in educational administration and rural education. The faculty and students of the school expressed their welcome.</p>
<h3>Xu Yunzhi Discusses the Development Plan for Pudong Middle School</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Xu Yunzhi, the newly appointed principal of Pudong Middle School in this city, was urged by the school's board of directors a decade ago to come to Shanghai to take charge, he has been actively reorganizing the internal affairs and handling enrollment matters. Mr. Xu is one of the few domestic experts in science education and has taught at various universities for many years, advocating for scientific movements with great effort. This time, he has been highly recommended by all parties to take charge of the prestigious Pudong Middle School. He will surely be able to use his talents to open up a new path for secondary education. A Shanghai press reporter interviewed Mr. Xu at the China Science Society on Albert Road yesterday and was told of his development plan for Pudong Middle School as follows: Mr. Xu said, "We all know that education and culture are the foundation for the rise and fall of a nation. Secondary education, in particular, is the backbone of national education. Most middle school graduates will soon enter society, and whether they are establishing themselves, pursuing studies, or seeking employment, they will all take the education they received in middle school as their starting point. Over the years, education in our country [has not aligned theory with practice], which has almost become a common problem. Last year, Mr. Chen Guofu suggested reforming the education system, intending to make up for this shortcoming. Pudong Middle School has been operating for twenty-seven years. The predecessors worked hard, and the scale is complete, and the academic style is sincere and simple, which is indeed rare among schools across the country. In the future, I personally believe that the following eight things should be paid attention to: (1) Give full play to the advantages of science specialization and make it tend towards the development of science, engineering, agriculture, and other fields; (2) Strictly train and maintain the excellent school spirit and reputation; (3) Hire excellent teachers to improve the students' level. This year's newly hired experts such as Hu Pu'an, Xie Fusheng, Zhou Changshou, Huang Tianpeng, Du Yangeng, Yu Xueyang, and Qian He to teach are for this purpose; (4) Enrich the library, instruments, and other equipment to enhance students' interest in autonomous research and experiments; (5) Pay attention to physical education and hire physical education experts to take charge, striving to popularize physical education, exercise and strengthen the body, and hope to restore Pudong Middle School's past glory in the sports world; (6) Promote extracurricular activities to socialize the school and make students' labor productive, breaking the long-standing bad habit of focusing solely on books; (7) Implement production education, utilize the agricultural and industrial environment to transform Pudong society; (8) As for internal staff, focus on talents, such as Wu Baoyue, Gao Naitong, Wang Keming, Zhang Shuqin, etc., whose knowledge and experience are extremely rich. The school's directors, Li Gufan, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Jixian, Zhang Xiaoliang, and others, have strongly supported the school, and the students also deeply love their alma mater. I have been recommended by all parties and find the responsibility heavy and my talents lacking. I deeply fear failure, but I am fortunate that the enlightened society will correct me in many ways," he said.</p>
<h3>Baotong County Normal School Closed, County Junior High School to be Established</h3>

The original county normal school, established for more than ten years, has graduated four to five hundred people who have served in this county. From this year onwards, it will be closed. The local education authorities, considering that after the closure of the county normal school, graduates of various primary schools will definitely feel it difficult to continue their studies, intend to prepare for the establishment of a county junior high school at the original site of the county normal school. Local gentry are also very willing to contribute funds to support it. It is now heard that the plan has been approved by the Department of Education, and the County Education Bureau has also started preparations and will soon publish an enrollment advertisement in the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Yi Zhao Primary School Adds School Buildings</h3>
<p>Since its opening, Yi Zhao Primary School on Hartung Road, Cihou North Lane, has been thriving and has won the praise of local people and the trust of students' parents. Ms. He Yizhao, the principal, is enthusiastic about education and works hard. The results have been remarkable. In April last year, it was approved and registered by the Education Bureau. In terms of curriculum, the Education Bureau often sends personnel to inspect. In terms of hygiene, the Municipal Council Health Department also often sends personnel to guide. With the attention of both parties, the number of students increased further last semester. For the next semester, the newly built house at No. 17 Jincheng Villa, opposite the China Bookstore on Jing'an Temple Road, will be rented as the second department. The original school in Cihou North Lane is the first department and also accepts boarding students to facilitate those who study from afar. The hygiene equipment of the new school building is quite perfect, and the classrooms are well-lit. For the next semester, more experienced teachers will be hired. The school's organization is a senior primary school, a junior primary school, and a kindergarten. The second department's school building has not yet been completed. The general office is still on Hartung Road. The first department handles all enrollment procedures and has already started enrollment. Recently, the registration has been very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Zheng Zhaojia's performance yesterday was greatly reduced. He lost the first set 6-3. Although he won three sets in a row after that, there was nothing exciting. Many balls went out of bounds or hit the net. The heavy cannonball serves and the sharp arrow-like smashes were rarely seen.

<p>Ma Anquan 6丨1 6丨3 6丨2 Guo Yujie</p>

<h3>England and France to Compete for Davis Cup Starting Today</h3>
<p>General observation is that England is hopeful. The French are confident that the victory still belongs to France. (Havas News Agency, Paris, 26th) The Davis Cup final will be held on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of this week at the Roland Garros tennis court in the suburbs of Paris. The English players are still Austin, Panley, and Hughes, who held the intercontinental final. Austin and Panley will play singles, while Hughes and Panley will play doubles. The French players have been decided: Ke Xian and the newcomer Molan will play singles, and Bruning and Borochra will play doubles. Generally, people are quite surprised by Molan's selection, and the comments are mixed. Everyone says that Bernard or Pousse are better than Molan, so why abandon them and take this one? But the selection of the French team members was decided by the great tennis master Lagoste. Mr. La has a wealth of experience, and his brilliance cannot be denied by anyone. Molan's skills may be inferior to Pousse's, but he has the advantage of being strong-willed and unyielding, which is indispensable in important competitions. Some people still hope that Borochra will dismiss his decision not to participate in singles again and win glory for the country. British and American newspapers believe that English players are very likely to win. American players such as Barnes and Loth also have the same view, but the French believe that this year's Davis Cup will still be retained by France.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Football Association Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>The proposal that non-Hong Kong resident players cannot participate in the competition was rejected. (Hong Kong dispatch) At the annual meeting of the Hong Kong Football Association on the 14th of this month, the nine amendments to the constitution proposed by William, the representative of the Army, were discussed. After some discussion, two were passed and seven were rejected. The most important one was [Players ordered to leave the field shall not participate in any competition of the Football Association before being dealt with. If they are accused of violating the rules but have not been dealt with within ten days, and it is not delayed by the player, they can still participate in all competitions of the Association before the case has been dealt with]. Opinions of the members were divided on this article, so it was not passed. As for Article 7 of the Hong Kong Official Football Competition Regulations—Non-Hong Kong resident members cannot participate in the various football competitions organized by the Hong Kong Football Association, if passed, Feng Jingxiang, Tan Jiangbai, and Li Tiansheng, who play for the South China Club, will not be able to appear on the green field in Hong Kong again. (According to Feng Tan Li, they all work in Guangzhou) Therefore, Mo Qing, the representative of the South China Club, strongly argued against this, and Mr. Holland, the former manager of the Football Association, also said that the Board of Directors proved that whether a football player is a resident of Hong Kong is extremely difficult to do, because anyone who rents a room or a house in Hong Kong can be called a Hong Kong resident.</p>
<p>Mo Qing continued, upper-class Chinese in Hong Kong often spend most of their time in Hong Kong. The representatives thought that the two men's arguments were quite reasonable, so they rejected the proposal. Also, [Army players cannot compete for various civilian clubs] was also rejected. The case of [Referees for A, B, and C group competitions shall be paid five yuan for each game] was passed and implemented. The remaining case of changing the organization, which stipulated that the Football Association includes one president, three vice presidents, [one Western civilian, one Chinese, and one elected by the Army Union] one chairman, elected at the annual meeting, one honorary manager, and one honorary deputy manager, elected at the first meeting after the annual meeting each year, with the term of office ending after the new manager is elected, was also rejected. Also, Article 4 of the Football Association's constitution, which proposed to change the [Executive Committee] to include the officials of the Association and the following members: one representative from each club participating in Group A competitions, with the list submitted at the annual meeting, each club participating in Group B and Group C competitions (excluding those who also participate in Group A) will be merged into three groups: Chinese, Western civilian, and Army Union, with each group electing one representative, with the list submitted at the annual meeting. In special circumstances, each club or group can elect a representative to replace it, all were rejected. The remaining cases concerning the Emergency Committee, which must deal with players accused of violating the rules within ten days, and that the Army can send two full-power representatives due to transfer reasons, were also rejected.</p>

They are ready to gather a team to compete with Zhou Xuan, who won the Hong Kong Table Tennis Championship, and the Hong Kong Oriental Sports Association recently telegraphed Lu Zhongqiu, a famous Cantonese table tennis player in Shanghai, saying that they will be allowed to come to Shanghai in early August. This trip will include one men's team and one women's team, about 20 people. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Lu immediately discussed everything with Xu Duo and others of the Table Tennis Federation. As a result of the discussion, the accommodation problem and competition venue for the men's team were all contacted by Xu Duo to the Chinese Jiande Association, and the women's team was contacted by Yu Binqi, and it was also planned that the strong teams such as City Jia, Hongzhang, Gu, Yarn, San Yi, You Jia, and Guangdong would fight in rotation on a daily basis. As for the women's side, the city's female players will also be selected and assembled into a team to fight in response. Those who have already planned that each strong team is willing to participate in the war can notify Xu Duo of the Shanghai Postal Administration in writing so that they can be included in the order list at that time. If people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about table tennis and are willing to donate prizes, they are also requested to contact Xu Duo.</p>

<h3>Jealous Wife Kills Concubine Case</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>(2) The weak-willed female student, Chen, refers to the Republic of China as the Republic of Chinese Officials, only because everyone is greedy to be an official, and an official is [in a high position and has a lot of money]. Worshipping someone who is [in a high position and has a lot of money] is not just the fault of one Su Qi's sister-in-law. Any woman who admires vanity wants to be an official's wife who is surrounded by followers! If you can't be the first wife, being a concubine is also fine with her. This is an evil characteristic in the women's world, and it has gradually infected female students. Therefore, Chen, a female student from a certain school in Guangzhou who is famous for her beauty, actually fell for Yang Shaoxiu's high position and wealth, and did not hesitate to lower her status to become his exclusive favorite.</p>
<p>Yang married Chen as a concubine and built a golden house to hide her, which was kept secret from his legal wife, Huang. Although Huang had heard rumors, she had not confirmed them; however, Yang's father, who did not know the situation, sent a letter, which mistakenly fell into the hands of the tigress. The power of jealousy is higher than all kinds of flames, so this sensational jealous wife killed the concubine occurred.</p>
<p>In addition to the tigress, there is also a [old master's orderly], who can really [add wings to the tiger]. This orderly is Huang's distant relative. Huang's plan to kill the concubine also involved the orderly's secret participation. It was falsely claimed that Yang Shaoxiu suddenly suffered a serious illness at the first wife's place, and a letter was sent to Chen by the orderly, urging Chen to come and say goodbye quickly. Chen loved her husband deeply and went with tears in her eyes. Hey! Once Chen entered the tiger's den, she was feeding the tiger with her own flesh, and there was no hope of returning alive! From that day on, Yang's beloved concubine Chen was declared missing.</p>
<p>Chen had a distant relative who is a current member of the CPC Committee in Guangdong. After she went missing, Chen's mother was heartbroken and suspected that her daughter had died a violent death; she cried and begged the CPC Committee member to secretly ask the Public Security Bureau to arrest the murderer and seek justice. So, Detective Chen Zhiyun spent a lot of effort on this case, and the truth was revealed. After reporting to the headquarters, Chen Jitang was furious and placed Yang Shaoxiu under surveillance and ordered him to be transferred to the court for punishment according to the law. The once-powerful celebrity now has a frightened look on his face.</p>
<p>How did Detective Chen Zhiyun reveal this tragedy? There is a strong sense of detective novels in it, and in the future, Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing can be asked to include it in Chinese detective stories. What is the case like? Please see the third part.</p>
<h3>Sympathy</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>Human beings are the ugliest things. Where is there such a thing as sympathy?</p>
<p>The tyranny of the scorching sun is beautifully called... [exploitation]! [Prosperity]! [Striving for survival]! Exploitation, prosperity, and striving for survival—are these for you small people to eat, dress, live in houses, and have sons? The Republic of China has always been magnanimous and does not shirk its responsibilities. In the Sino-Japanese War, the May 3rd Incident... it has retreated step by step! Take a step back, and then another step back! Even the occupation of Rehe in the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and even Shanghai, Pingjin, Jinan, Hankou... etc., all treat your people equally and even protect them with extra care; however, you [Japanese bellies have many bumps], advancing step by step; [Sino-Japanese friendship], [peaceful resolution], [ceasefire agreement], what beautiful terms, and now the facts have proven it! Is it [nibbling]? [Swallowing]? [Imperialist aggression]? Humph! The tricks are new! Covering the sun with one hand! Who can't see it? What about Puyi? What about Manchuria? Isn't it you who helped to produce a deformed monster? Is it firmly stuck on the Republic of China like a moldy wart?</p>
<p>Human sympathy, even if it exists, is like a firefly, appearing and disappearing, rarely like the sun in the sky, selfless and shining everywhere.</p>
<p>[I have some books that I can lend you!]</p>
<p>"I can send you a large batch of valuable books!"</p>
<p>'Oh! Oh! Oh! Let's find a way! Let's all think of a way!</p>
<p>Way! ······I will definitely help you!'</p>
<p>Haha! How pitiful! Saying it is better than singing! Saying it over and over again is just drawing cakes to satisfy hunger!</p>
<p>Looking at these two things, big and small, it can be said; 'Human beings are the ugliest things! Where is there such a thing as sympathy?' Everyone is deceiving each other; therefore, there are few who repay kindness with kindness, and even fewer who repay kindness with resentment. In fact, he himself is [building a Taoist temple in a snail shell]!</p>
<p>Therefore, I advocate that everyone express their sympathy entirely in action; throw the piece of sympathy into the future, twenty years, thirty years, seventy years, eighty years, or a hundred years later, and then take it out to rotate and listen to see if the tone has changed?</p>
<h3>Before the Lotus Pond</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The cool mornings and evenings of summer have a common beauty. If one wants to live up to this beauty, it is best to walk to the front of the lotus pond and linger for a moment.</p>
<p>At this time, the sky emits wisps of red light, the sun is bright but not sultry; the water surface ripples with golden silk patterns, weaving into a brilliant reflection. Around the reflection, layers of green lotuses stand tall and graceful. From a distance, they look like many beautiful young girls holding green umbrellas, with red and white faces, showing their liveliness and innocence. In the morning when the sun is just rising, you can peek at the [disheveled] look of the flowers; in the evening when the sun is setting, you can glimpse the [sleepy] posture. This is not the full frontal view, but it is also the true face of Mount Lu! At midday, when the flowers are in full bloom, what is so interesting about that dignified face?</p>
<p>There are pearl-like mercury balls and jade-like mercury blocks on the lotus leaves, and the ever-flowing mercury flashes with silver-like brilliance. The lotus breeze blows gently, bringing a fragrant breath that rushes into the nostrils and penetrates into the lungs; one cannot help but raise one's head and breathe deeply; a nameless pleasure will rise in the heart! However, when you look down again, the mercury balls and mercury blocks that were previously on the lotus leaves have long been scattered by that gentle breeze and gone to who knows where! The newly discovered silver balls and silver blocks that occupy a corner of the lotus leaf are still rippling. A feeling of [everything changes] cannot help but creep into the heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sounds of 'cicada'! 'Cicada!' This is the sound of the singing cicadas fluttering their wings on the drooping willow branches by the pond. Cicada, cicada, who believes that they can really [know]? It is better than those swallows that don't easily open their mouths, relying on their naturally light bodies, flying back and forth, skimming the water surface, and touching the lotus bushes; how enviable that is!</p>
<p>Fish swim freely in the shade of the lotus bushes, and fishermen squat on the shore, waiting quietly for the fish to take their hooks. However, the clever fish do not eat at this time, so people leave their fishing rods empty and complain about the full pond of lotus flowers, which is really unreasonable.</p>
<h3>Yu Sheng Comes South and Hastily Departs North Again; The Ancestral Tent Is Left and a Farewell Poem Is Offered</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yu</p>
<p>You came to visit an old friend,</p>
<p>Not hesitating a thousand *li* journey.</p>
<p>I go to see you off on your return,</p>
<p>Pitying the fragrant grass along the road.</p>
<p>Coming and going so hastily,</p>
<p>How can we leave behind lasting thoughts?</p>
<p>You say worldly affairs are always like this,</p>
<p>Why worry about fleeting traces?</p>
<p>Once you boldly stirred up wind and cloud,</p>
<p>Crossing the sea by raft to remote islands.</p>
<p>America and Europe,</p>
<p>Traversing laws, justice, and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Foreign customs have unique styles,</p>
<p>Immersing and enriching literary compositions.</p>
<p>Returning to the lecture hall with layers of mats,</p>
<p>A pen battle that sweeps away thousands of people.</p>
<p>Writing poems as a side pursuit is also delightful,</p>
<p>Manuscripts emerging daily without cease.</p>
<p>Recently traveling north, south, east, and west,</p>
<p>Each piece that leaves your hand is creative.</p>
<p>Now I believe poetry is related to travel,</p>
<p>The mechanism within this no one understands.</p>
<p>What I heard you say,</p>
<p>Is mostly profound and essential.</p>
<p>The way of poetry is mysterious and profound,</p>
<p>You can observe its subtle essence.</p>
<p>You are inherently fond of travel and skilled in poetry,</p>
<p>Your "Western Expedition" volume is particularly artful. (You have a collection of "Western Expedition Miscellaneous Poems.")</p>
<p>The depiction of mountains and rivers is lifelike,</p>
<p>The description of characters is refined and thorough.</p>
<p>Evoking emotions, observing the masses, expressing resentment is the norm,</p>
<p>But tranquility, detachment, and clarity are rarely understood.</p>
<p>This journey should inspire poetry,</p>
<p>Traveling south and then north again.</p>
<p>Returning to the Palace of Art,</p>
<p>Looking up and down, searching exhaustively.</p>
<p>Peng Shi and Shakespeare,</p>
<p>May as well continue Du Fu's legacy.</p>
<p>Blending East and West into one furnace,</p>
<p>Its value is a priceless treasure.</p>
<p>Sending you off a thousand *li*, I wish you peace,</p>
<p>A long song fills the vast wind. (Tianfeng Pavilion Poem)</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Generals – A New Beginning</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>This time several generals resisted Japan,</p>
<p>Ma, Su, and Li are the most famous.</p>
<p>They endured hardships for over a year,</p>
<p>Passing their days through gunfire and bullets.</p>
<p>Never fearing airplanes and artillery,</p>
<p>Enduring cold and hunger, suffering immensely.</p>
<p>Truly wearing iron armor day and night,</p>
<p>Commanding the troops, exhausting their spirits.</p>
<p>Just because the Japanese invaders are rampant,</p>
<p>Seizing the three northeastern provinces in one gulp.</p>
<p>Therefore, the generals report to the country, fulfilling their loyalty,</p>
<p>Willing to sacrifice their lives in a desperate fight.</p>
<p>Ultimately, heroes are admired by all,</p>
<p>Saying that China still has people with backbone.</p>
<p>Just because they lack guns and ammunition,</p>
<p>They had no choice but to retreat, heartbroken.</p>
<p>Today is the day they return from overseas,</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people welcome them.</p>
<p>Seeing their demeanor fulfills a wish,</p>
<p>What do heroes really look like?</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce holds a welcoming meeting,</p>
<p>Various groups participate, bustling and lively.</p>
<p>Military role models, Ma, Su, and Li,</p>
<p>How many can defend the borders?</p>
<p>I compile this new beginning as a welcome. (A Return Gift)</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A Humble and Poor Man Joins the Army; A Sickly Man Falls Behind and Gladly Resigns; A Sentimental Soldier, Zhao Ziqiang, Thinking in His Heart, Walks to the Courtyard and, Together with the Platoon Leader, Leads the Brothers to the Training Ground. Upon Arriving at the Training Ground, the Soldiers Immediately Begin Running Exercises. Zhao Ziqiang Also Follows Them in Running. It Turns Out That Morning Running Is a Unique Method of the Northern Army. The Weather Is Cold to the Point That Water Turns to Ice, and Clothing Cannot Resist the Cold. The Muscles of the Whole Body Cannot Obey Their Own Commands, and the Soldiers Are Even Holding onto the Ice-Cold Gun Barrels. How Can They Even Drill Like This? Therefore, Upon Arriving at the Training Ground, Without Questioning Anything, They First Start Running. After Running Until They Sweat and Feel Warmth, They Begin Drilling. This Morning, However, It Is Especially Cold. The Sky Has Been Bright for a Long Time, but the Sun Has Not Yet Come Out. The Sky Is Gloomy, As if It Is About to Snow. Zhao Ziqiang, After All, Did Not Sleep Comfortably Last Night. He Is Not Running So Desperately. He Does Not Feel Particularly Cold. However, His Two Hands Hang Outside, and His Fingers Are Painfully Frozen. He Intends to Put on the Gloves in His Pocket, but After Looking at the Soldiers, He Does Not Want to Wear Them. As an Officer, Would He Want People to Say That He Is Not as Cold-Resistant as the Soldiers? Because These Past Few Days, the Gloves That the Soldiers Bought, Originally Stored in the Storage Room, Are Now Going to Be Inspected, so They Are Taking Them Out to Display Them. If the Company Commander Wears Gloves, How Can the Soldiers Not Wear Them? Therefore, Zhao Ziqiang Rubs His Hands Together and Stands to the Side, Watching the Platoon Leaders Drill. However, Standing Still Is Not Good. The Cold Wind Blowing in from the Fog Cuts at His Ears Like Small Knives. Northern Military Hats All Have Two Leather Ear Flaps, but Since Ear Flaps Were Invented, No One Has Ever Been Seen Taking Them Down. Therefore, Zhao Ziqiang Stands Here, Only Feeling That His Ears Are Cold, Never Remembering That There Are Two Ear Flaps on His Hat That Can Be Lowered. He Thinks That if He Follows Along and Watches the Drill Like This, the Cold in His Body Will Definitely Not Go Away. Therefore, He Gathers the Entire Company and Stands in Front of the Ranks to Give a Speech. (141)</p>
<p>Where Travels Lead</p>
<h3>One Day in Gaoqiao</h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>A certain Sunday morning in July 1933.</p>
<p>The morning sun painted the rouge red, trudgingly, floating above the water level. The Huangpu River was covered in fiery red light, like an ancient bronze mirror, the slowly moving municipal ferry, dyed golden.</p>
<p>The ferry stretched its long nose, emitting wisps of black smoke, floating upwards, harmonizing with the black smoke from the tall chimneys of Pudong, dancing a revolving dance in the blue, white, and red sky. The July river wind, directly hitting the bow, blowing the turned-up collar onto the earlobes, how refreshing!</p>
<p>The water rolled up from under the boat, gurgling; splitting apart to both sides, small sampans bobbing and swaying.</p>
<p>With a heart of terror and caution, on the white wave-flying river surface, under the iron palms of large warships filled with weapons, passing through Chuansha, Qingning Temple, Donggou, finally reaching our destination!</p>
<p>| Gaoqiao has arrived.</p>
<p>The public bus came flying with a "beep beep", and people surged up like a tide; very luckily, our group of six people, not one slipped away, squeezed into the carriage, but sweat had already drenched our clothes like mildew.</p>
<p>The car drove crazily, and after a while, stopped in Gaoqiao, so we bravely squeezed out of the car again.</p>
<p>The sun had already hung high above our heads, there were still three *li* to the seaside bathing beach, so we had to take a small car.</p>
<p>The winding small road, so far, so far stretching. In the lush trees, releasing bursts of cicada sounds, water buffaloes snoozing under the big trees, children bathing in the stream, farmers shaking banana leaf fans, quietly lying on bamboo chairs at the door. In the fields, tender green rice seedlings, gently swaying, shattered sunlight shooting down through the trees, secretly walking on the winding ridges, walking, walking, a poetic, quiet, complete picture!</p>
<p>The small car turned from the small road onto the dry main road, and rickshaws and wheelbarrows became more numerous. The sound of wheels harmonized, climbing like ants, the wind rolled up dust and flew away, blowing until we couldn't breathe. When the high roof of the seaside hotel came into view, we got out of the car and went to the hotel to drink a few bottles of soda, and then rushed to the seaside for a swim.</p>
<p>The seawater was so calm, the midday sun drew a blue straight line on the sea, white sailboats, white seagulls, adorned the beautiful seascape, on the grass by the beach, white-bottomed blue-striped awnings were set up, a camp-like one connecting to another. After resting in the awning for a while, we changed into swimming suits and went for a pleasant swim. Curvaceous women, healthy men, floating and sinking in the muddy, fishy-smelling seawater.</p>
<p>The waves were too big, so we came up after swimming for a while, and under a large umbrella by our awning, we discovered a few bright and glittering stars:</p>
<p>Little sister Liminghui, wearing a non-Chinese non-Western yellow fashion, short sleeves, wide trousers, wearing a large yellow straw hat on her head, covering half of her small pink face, only revealing two artificially made red rib-sides. She jumped and laughed, as if forgetting all worries.</p>
<p>Sweet sister Lili completely tanned, the snake of Eden! She didn't go into the water, only put her two large legs in the water to soak, and munched on her golden melon.</p>
<p>I heard there were also the artistic couple Dan Duyu, the many-child couple Gao Zhanfei, and wild rose Wang Renmei.</p>
<p>A red-clothed girl holding a pink umbrella, strolling with dancing steps, a shallow dimple on her pink face, thus arousing a conversation between two friends:</p>
<p>"Isn't that Hu Die?"</p>
<p>"Isn't that Qingting!"</p>
<p>The red-clothed girl's face turned red, turning her head around, giving a charming wink, was it a contemptuous look? Was it a flirtatious look?</p>
<p>The seawater changed with the movement of the sunlight, first gray-white, light red, ochre, azure, and then deep blue. Then night began to blur. Dragging our tired bodies, we went back the way we came. Shanghai had arrived again, the city was lighting countless eyes to welcome us.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Observation</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xue</p>
<p>If you grab a "literature teacher," and ask them about "observation," this is their forte. They will tell you endlessly that "observation" must be profound; even citing extensively, saying that a certain master once told each student to spend an hour looking at a leaf, and that a certain master led a class of students to a crossroads to look at a rickshaw puller, and that each saw something different, and how to find the characteristics of each in similar objects, etc. In fact, the problem is not so simple.</p>
<p>Lu Xun, in "Letters from Two Places," talked about an incident. One of his relatives often pestered his mother. Once, he returned home, "and immediately went out and scolded him greatly." At this time—</p>
<p>He did not resist at all, but said that he was very willing. I thought he was too spineless, but he said that he was actually a brave man, but he did not resist me. I said that I wanted people to resist me, and to leave me if they disagreed. He said that it was precisely because of this that he admired me and did not resist me.</p>
<p>Such a "brave man" is similar to what Shanghai people call a "boat braid" or a "hero" in a fight. At first, they rush towards the opponent aggressively; the second step is to braid up their hair in preparation for a decisive battle; but when the opponent is really about to strike, they shout "Wait a minute!" and take off their shoes and run away. There is a reason for running: "A hero does not suffer immediate losses." In reality, this kind of person never intended to "fight" in the first place, and running away is not for seeking help. The formal "indignation," "determination," and "resistance" are just a hoax.</p>
<p>Therefore, when it comes to "observation," it is not enough or accurate to understand it from the surface phenomenon. If you only talk about phenomena, then Qin Hui never admitted to colluding with the Jin; and President Hu Lifu, even when he was about to be executed, still cried out that he was wronged, saying that he was dying for the local area. If you examine the surface, the phenomenon, how will you draw your conclusions?</p>
<p>Not only that, but some things can be even more confusing. For example, the Duolun incident, Mr. Feng Yuxiang said that it was "taken down" with great sacrifice; but Mr. Wang Jingwei absolutely denied it, saying that the Japanese "gave it up" without a single soldier dying or an arrow being broken. Another example is technical cooperation. On the one hand, it is said that various countries are seeking benefits for China; on the other hand, it is seen as a further step in the imperialist partition of China. Each side speaks plausibly and righteously about these things. If you go by the surface, it is really impossible to draw a conclusion.</p>
<p>"Observation" is not an easy task, as can be seen from this. Teaching students like the "literature teacher" mentioned earlier will inevitably make students more and more confused, and the more confused they are, the more incomprehensible they become. Therefore, superficial, phenomenal "observation" is not enough; to train observation, you must understand it from the essence, through the surface of all phenomena. Only the conclusions obtained from the essential understanding will be accurate and unbreakable.</p>
<p>The problem of "observation" is, in fact, the problem of "knowledge."</p>
<h3>A Problem Within</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The old lady of the Chinese nation is said to be suffering from [a problem within.]</p>
<p>What kind of problems is this "problem within" causing? According to the doctor, the upper layer is tuberculosis, a group of tubercle bacilli are wreaking havoc in the respiratory organs, draining all the blood from her body, making her face yellow and thin, and causing breathing difficulties: she has also borrowed some blood from others, but it is soon sucked dry again. The middle layer is appendicitis and stomach cancer. The old, decrepit, and foolish organs are inflamed and painful, festering and producing pus; the stomach lining is swollen, causing acidity and pain. The lower layer is liver qi pain and intestinal carbuncles: liver fire flares up, causing insomnia all night; stagnation and blockage hinder digestion. In addition, she is suffering from colds and wind-chill, internal and external problems combining. This old lady is critically ill, truly in danger!</p>
<p>I heard that this old lady has quite a bit of property, so why not ask a doctor to take a look? The old lady is surrounded by a large group of busybodies. They say: "We have already made vows before the Goddess of Mercy, eaten the incense ashes from before the Tathagata Buddha, hung Zhang Tianshi's talisman in front of the bed, and swallowed the elixirs of the Maoshan Taoists three times; if it doesn't work, then nothing will!" The old lady's youngest son once hired a Western doctor, determined to operate on the old lady. The busybodies roared: "Foreign devils! Foreign devils! You who have sold your souls to foreign devils are not allowed to approach the old lady!" The old lady's second son also hired a Chinese medicine practitioner to take her pulse. The doctor said: "A heavy purge with rhubarb and croton is necessary." The busybodies roared again: "The divination before the Bodhisattva showed that the God of Joy is coming from the east, there is no need for rhubarb!" Even the well-known doctor hired by the old lady's eldest son only wanted to feed the old lady astragalus and ginseng, but the busybodies still roared non-stop. The old lady's current life-saving soup is first "incense ashes," second "incense ashes," and third still "incense ashes."</p>
<p>Alas! Is this the reason for the "problem within"?</p>
<h3>Answering a Friend's Question About Ghosts</h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>Many people see Sichuan as a strange place. You wrote to me, asking if there are ghosts in Sichuan, but you didn't specify what kind of ghosts. Some people call ancient prose "ghostly scribbles." Nowadays, these "ghostly scribbles" are still popular, and even students write them a lot. Their purpose, besides becoming officials or secretaries, is, according to middle school students, to prepare for college entrance exams in the future, and, according to college students, to teach middle school students after graduation. If what you're asking about is this kind of "ghost" in the form of ancient prose scribbles, then I can say that there are many.</p>
<p>The phrase "acting suspiciously" usually refers to someone who is not generous in their actions, who deceives and cheats, who lies arbitrarily, who speaks haltingly, and who often contradicts themselves; or who uses public office for private gain, or who betrays their country for glory; who often runs to the powerful at night, and who expresses their opinions to people with winks and eyebrow movements. These kinds of ghosts naturally exist, and there are quite a few.</p>
<p>There are also so-called "troublemaking" ghosts, who fabricate rumors, or who deliberately turn small matters into big ones, in order to shock and confuse people; who make it seem like something is happening when nothing is actually happening. For example, if a young man is talking to his sister-in-law, a bored reporter sees this and, without distinguishing right from wrong, says that the female student is doing this and that, making a big article out of it and spreading it widely. These kinds of ghosts really do exist.</p>
<p>As for the idea that ghosts go shopping in the afternoon, I heard that when I was eight or nine years old. It was said that in Chengdu, Sichuan, every shop had to prepare a copper basin filled with water in the afternoon. If the money paid by a customer floated on the surface of the water in that copper basin, it was paper ash, which was a sign of seeing a ghost. I have been to Chengdu and often gone shopping in the afternoon, but I have never seen the money I paid put in a water basin, nor have I seen such a copper basin filled with water in a shop. However, Sichuan people have a very common curse word, called "ghost son." Logically speaking, if there are ghost sons, then there must be big ghosts, as if they admit that they live with ghosts. However, we cannot conclude from this that Sichuan definitely has</p>
<p>special ghosts, because there is an even more common curse word, which is "dog × de," meaning born of a dog. Dogs can only give birth to dogs, and people are of course born of people, but Sichuan people often use dog × de to curse people. I personally heard a boatman use this word to curse his own son. It can be seen that it is nothing more than an expression of anger and contempt. However, from the curse word "ghost son," we can know that Sichuan people look down on ghosts.</p>
<p>Of course, according to Confucius, talking about ghosts is not as important as talking about people. In Sichuan today, the problem is soldiers, not ghosts. The types of ghosts mentioned above are not</p>
<p>unique to Sichuan. I'm afraid they are the same everywhere, or at least similar. As for curse words, doesn't Jiangsu also have the phrase "little ghost"?</p>
<h3>The Market</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>This is the other side of the world. There is no green glow here, no intoxicating jazz music, no shiny black leather shoes or wavy hair. Although this is also a place of entertainment, it is not high-end. All there is here is ear-splitting singing and dazzling butterflies. Red lips constantly spitting out light, flirtatious sounds, soft collars intentionally sending out powdery fragrance; but three steps later, a pair of dark eyes are staring intently. The girl giggles, "Hey, sit for a while!" Her eyes dart back unnaturally; the rustic old man in a white gown and dark face is flustered, his hands clasped in a bow, "Oh, oh..." Then, a drunken lip comes to his ear. A beautiful girl in a long cheongsam is making eyes and speaking softly to a rustic old man; but no one is surprised, they are making a deal!</p>
<p>Shoulder to shoulder, the butterflies are weaving through the crowd, their eyes revealing a hungry search. They are also wearing high heels and carrying purses, but they have lost the beautiful admiration of girls. Beautiful clothes are just their shop signs, showcase decorations; expressionless faces conceal all their joys, angers, loves, and hates, they only know how to smile mechanically, smiling mechanically at every person with silver, they are commodified and displayed for sale.</p>
<p>A man with a wide-open collar, staggering from behind, unexpectedly bumps into the leg of someone standing: "Haha," he turns back and makes a face. After an involuntary scold, she immediately laughs along with him, "Auntie," she calls out to the dark eyes standing not far away, and stumbles over, shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>Laughter, spreading in every corner, and thus business is concluded in every corner.</p>
<h3>On Works About "Abundant Disaster"</h3>
<p>— Feng Wu</p>
<p>Due to the objective facts, in 1933, depictions of abundant disaster became one of the main themes for writers. As far as I have seen, in terms of novels, there is Mao Dun's "Autumn Harvest" (Shen Bao Monthly), Ye Shaojun's "More Than Three or Five Dou of Harvest" (Literature); in terms of drama, there is Bai Wei's one-act play "Abundant Disaster" (China Monthly); in film, Li Pingqian's "Abundant Year" (Star) has already started filming. This serious current phenomenon is widely reflected in all departments of art.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here is only the two aspects of novels and drama. Ye Shaojun's piece depicts the shattering of farmers' fantasies after a good harvest, using the scene of selling rice. Bai Wei's drama, on the other hand, depicts the bloody struggle of farmers resisting taxes and rent after the abundant disaster has already occurred. Mao Dun's novel should be viewed as a system connected to "Spring Silkworms" (Modern) and "Remaining Winter" (Literature). No matter how good a harvest farmers get in any aspect, they still cannot avoid hunger, and this hunger gradually forms their war for their own interests. Although the focus of the three works is different, their purpose is the same: to attempt to depict the phenomenon of abundant disaster, to explain some of the essential reasons for the occurrence of abundant disaster, and the inevitable self-awareness of farmers in such a living environment.</p>
<p>"The inevitable self-awareness in this living environment," this power is less expressed in Ye Shaojun's "More Than Three or Five Dou of Harvest." Although the farmers who sold their rice at a cheap price once thought: "If there's nothing to eat in the future, we'll come and eat yours," they didn't have the courage to do so. In the end, they still "borrow money to pay rent," "endure lawsuits," "indulge in gambling," "give up renting and not planting,"</p>
<p>"go to the city." If we purely, conceptually, demand that literature only reflect the phenomena of social life, and that this reflection does not have to be complete, then this work can be given a good evaluation. But the facts do not allow us to think this way; because any one or several phenomena, if pulled away from the overall phenomena, is impossible in the structure of the entire society, and the essential reasons for the phenomena will not be correctly understood. Therefore, in the progress of work, it is very necessary to grasp all relations and all realistic opportunities as a whole, and to specifically describe it as "the summary of many various regulations," and as "the unity of diversity." And the author completely obliterated the main link of reality - the struggling, resisting farmer ... (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Ordinary Matters (25)</h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>"Boss, Mr. Zhang saw this with his own eyes when he followed us! We haven't said a single false word!" "My intention isn't much different from yours," Bo Tang said earnestly. "However, I also have to thoroughly consider the factory's and my family's affairs before I can give a definite answer. Everyone has worked very hard today, and even if I really could scrape together something to help, despite the increasingly tense situation in Zhabei, it's already dark now, and it would be useless to take it out. So, it wouldn't hurt to delay our answer a little... A little later, really only a little later, not three or five days, just until a comprehensive account is calculated, and then there can be a reply! Please come back at two o'clock tomorrow to discuss it."]</p>
<p>"Boss, thank you," Representative Qiu said. "It would be even better if it could be earlier!" "Then how about ten o'clock," Bo Tang said. "Anyway, Mr. Zhang has to be here. Whether it's finished calculating or not, it's not something only I can know. Everyone, have dinner before you leave."</p>
<p>This conversation came to a temporary end. Bo Tang's so-called "calculating a comprehensive account" was to prepare a proper method from the factory's and his family's financial strength to resolve the contradictions above himself.</p>
<p>Bo Tang finally started calculating the total account with Zhi Guang in the study upstairs. He began by asking:</p>
<p>"Zhi Guang, judging from the current situation, the enemy is repeatedly reinforcing, but our strength isn't exactly weak either. Friendly countries also have movements to send more fleets to China. Then, how long will this battle ultimately last, thinking of the shortest possible period?"</p>
<p>"This," Zhi Guang said hesitantly, "This... let's tentatively plan for another three or four months."</p>
<p>"Right, three or four months, naturally there can be a result, good or bad! But for our own affairs, whether we prepare to end things or prepare to drag them out, I think we need at least two months to see a way forward, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"We can assume that."</p>
<p>"Then what we need to plan for the factory is the salaries of our colleagues within these sixty days, the food or wages for some of the long-term workers, as well as the factory's miscellaneous expenses. In addition, we need to add the severance pay that will be needed at that time. In this way, the amount is considerable! Even though all the accounts in transit will be suspended!"</p>
<p>They each took an abacus and calculated for a while, thinking that it would be at least seven thousand yuan.</p>
<p>"But what about those deposits that can be recovered?" Bo Tang said.</p>
<p>They calculated again, and based on many accounting books and many receipts, the result was that even by estimating the maximum amount, it would only be around ten thousand.</p>
<p>"The factory seems to be able to handle itself with extra funds! But what about at home?"</p>

<h3>Distant Futures for Flour Beset by Difficulties</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after trading began in the morning, all months showed a tendency to be weak and stagnant. Although quoted prices for foreign wheat rose in Chicago by $1.78 and in Canada by around $1, the domestic situation was moving in the opposite direction from overseas. Originally, northern flour sales were expected to be strong during the new flour season, but now, with the countryside devastated, purchasing power has diminished. This situation is undeniably true, and there is a reason for the softening sentiment. Moreover, rumors of tax increases in the Northeast are circulating, suggesting that flour sales may become even more unfavorable in the future. Therefore, sentiment regarding distant futures has weakened further. As for factories, only smaller mills made minor offers, while larger mills remained inactive. At the close of trading, prices for the current month were down by 0.05 taels compared to the previous day, August-September were down by 0.075 taels, October was down by 0.125 taels, and November-December were down by 0.15 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures and Spot Prices Both Show Increasing Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures for the current month showed a poor trend in the morning trading, falling as low as 3.66 taels. The afternoon started flat, but towards the close, the market rose by 0.03-0.04 taels due to the purchase of non-standard contracts to cover positions. This situation was purely a matter of standards and did not significantly change the underlying reality. As for distant months, due to the surge in arrivals from various routes, smaller mills and merchants had already bought enough and were not interested in further purchases. Only Fuxin mill was still active, further dampening market sentiment. As a result, the current month was unchanged, while August to November all fell by 0.02 taels. In the spot wheat market, local mills had either large quantities of foreign wheat or were sluggish due to flour sales, leading brokers to rush to sell their goods, further weakening the situation. Prices fell by 0.03-0.05 taels across the board. Kaijiang wheat was at 3.70 taels, Tong wheat was at 3.71 taels, Gaoyou wheat was at 3.67 taels, and lower quality at 3.65 taels. Yangzhou wheat was at 3.60 taels, and lower quality at 3.57 taels. Huangqiao wheat was at 3.68 taels, Xinghua wheat was at 3.66 taels, and Liuhe wheat was at 3.57 taels and lower quality at 3.55 taels. Pukou wheat was at 3.55 taels. A total of over 10,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Up by 0.1 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw an upward trend as Customs Gold Units increased and the Dutch exchange rate slightly contracted. The Association set the opening price for ordinary Grade 24 coarse white sugar at 20.38 taels, while KNG-marked Dutch red sugar was lower at 16.25 taels. Factory prices saw Zhonghua brand refined white sugar opening up by 0.05 taels, with the top grade at 19.75 taels, Grade 1 at 19.55 taels, and Grades 2, 3, and 4 unchanged. Crystal ice sugar and Grades 1, 2, and 3 of genuine ice sugar remained at the original prices. Taikoo sugar B mark was quoted at 20.65 taels. Chaoshan merchants opened the market with over a hundred bags of direct-from-steamer green sugar, up 0.1-0.2 taels, at 14.60-14.55 taels. Furthermore, over eighty bags of Huizhou foreign white sugar were priced at 17 taels.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Melon Seeds and Apricot Kernels Gradually Entering the New Season</h3>
<p>New Jiudao eyebrow apricot kernels are arriving successively, with the initial price over 50 taels, and the current market price at 50 taels.</p>
<p>The first batch of new Xu Kui black melon seeds, amounting to several dozen bags, has arrived and was opened yesterday, priced at 14.88 taels and 15 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Increasingly Gloomy</h3>
<p>(Jiangning Attracts Merchants to Develop Autumn Silkworms) The Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County Government, recently aiming to develop autumn sericulture, has ordered 1,500 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs from the Nanjing Sericulture Improvement Center of the United States. It plans to test them in Lukou Town and other areas under the county's jurisdiction. However, due to the collapse of the rural economy, there are insufficient funds to purchase the eggs. It is now attracting merchants to provide advance payments for the purchase of the eggs, with each sheet priced at 1 tael, with 80% to be paid in advance. The cocoons produced will then be purchased by the merchant, and the advance payment will be deducted from the cocoon price (those who do not provide advance payments will not be allowed to purchase cocoons). Local silk cocoon merchants received a notice from the county government yesterday, urging them to bring funds to Nanjing to register.</p>
<p>(Xixin Factory Continues to Ship to Shanghai) As the end of the month approaches, manufacturers both inside and outside the port must deliver their positions for this month's futures silk on time. Therefore, Xixin Factory is continuously shipping to Shanghai. In recent days, passenger trains to Shanghai and Wuxi have carried an additional 120 pieces of brands such as "Moon Rabbit" and "Golden Bell."</p>
<p>(Sales of Artificial Silk Turn Slow) The autumn sales season for artificial silk has passed, and purchases from out-of-town merchants have decreased. Yesterday, only silk merchants from Suzhou and Shanghai purchased 20 cases of current month goods of brands such as "Green Goldfish" and "Red Golden Bell," priced at 174.50 taels to 162.25 taels net.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Trade Suddenly Booms</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trade in green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, and other areas suddenly surged, with total transactions reaching over 4,200 chests. Among them, Gongxi tea was the most active, and Xiamu needle and eyebrow teas were also exceptionally popular. Road-grade and local-grade Zhenmei teas also saw increased activity. This was due to the fact that overseas markets saw a significant increase in purchasing power due to the low price of Chinese tea this year. Shanghai foreign firms also learned that the quantity of inland tea was reduced, forcing them to compete to buy. It is anticipated that the green tea market will continue to develop.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Prices Increase</h3>
<p>The trend for woolen fabrics remained sluggish yesterday. Due to the hot weather, demand for summer goods was minimal, resulting in no wholesale transactions. However, for woolen goods needed in autumn and winter, merchants generally inquired, with most taking down order numbers and temporarily recording prices, to be finalized upon arrival. Lately there has been a lull in agreements regarding new goods for the 23rd year. According to foreign firms, they have received telegrams from foreign manufacturers stating that wool prices have risen, and the prices quoted in Shanghai must be appropriately increased. Consequently, firms placing orders are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see approach. It is reported that the most significant price increase is for new Zhongyong herringbone serge. Previously, the price for this fabric was 4 shillings and 11 pence per yard, but now the manufacturer's telegram indicates that the original price must be 5 shillings and 7-8 pence. After adding commissions for foreign firms, other goods have increased by an average of 1-2 pence to 3-5 pence. Therefore, order business for foreign firms is not as strong as in the first half of the month, and the amount of goods shipped in November and December has decreased significantly, it is said.</p>

<h3>Welcome European Buddhists to China for Ordination</h3>
<p>— Xiaozhi</p>
<p>Yesterday, all newspapers in this port's news section featured the headline "European Buddhists Come to China for Ordination," prominently displayed. The gist: there are a total of fifteen devout men and women, seven monks and eight nuns; in terms of nationality, seven are French, three are German, two are Italian, and one each from Belgium, Hungary, and Lithuania; the oldest is a nun of sixty years, and the youngest is a young monk of only twenty-one. All of them are well-known figures, specialized scholars, members of parliament, banking experts, [who recently] embraced Chinese Buddhism and specially organized a Buddhist refuge group in Paris to come to our Chinese Buddhist land to shave their heads and become monks, taking refuge in our Buddha Tathagata [reportedly to be ordained at the Baohua Altar on Baohua Mountain in China's Buddhist capital in two years]. On that day, prominent Buddhist figures, great lay Buddhists, great Chan masters, and representatives of religious organizations, including Zhao Kong and other monks, all went to the pier holding yellow flags, making clasped-hand gestures of welcome. Upon landing, the group of over one hundred people, consisting of guests and hosts, proceeded in a grand manner directly to Building No. 131 on Daxilu Road. Furthermore, when the group landed, travelers at the pier, upon hearing that these were foreign monks, gathered like ducks, whispering to each other in great surprise, it is said. Xiaozhi is also a most faithful believer in Buddhism. Although I don't have white dots on my head from incense burns, nor have I joined the party and been educated, I consider myself a [faithful fellow traveler from outside the door] of Buddhism. So, having not heard of this in advance, otherwise I should have burned incense, bathed, and purified myself before personally going to the pier to respectfully welcome these fifteen well-known and qualified Western Arhats, Living Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas. This is the biggest regret of my life of worshipping Buddha and eating vegetarian food! However, what's past is past. It's not as if I could call these living Bodhisattvas back onto the ship and then replay a comedy of holding yellow flags and clasped-hand welcomes. Therefore, my only way to make up for this lifelong regret and atone for the sin of [missing the welcome] is to write this [welcoming] text, and expound on the great meaning, hoping that after reading it, all beings will take refuge and faithfully and enthusiastically support these fifteen qualified Western comrades, Living Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas!</p>
<p>All beings should know that [recently] the reason why Westerners [venerate] our Chinese Buddhism and even come in groups to take refuge, the greatest credit goes to that move on September 18th of the 20th year of the Republic, when our Buddha's beloved disciple, young marshal Zhang Hanqing, the general of peace, abandoned Shenyang and even the four northeastern provinces! Because our Buddha most forbids killing, and war is naturally large-scale slaughter. Our general of peace, young marshal Zhang, devoutly believes in Buddhism and obeys the precepts, so he would rather not fire a shot and retreat his troops within the Pass. This is a boundless merit worthy of being greatly written about and admired by the world! Last year, our country also grandly and enthusiastically celebrated a year of saving the country through sutras and mantras, holding the Kalachakra Tantra Dharma Assembly, the Golden Light Dojo, and supporting the State Preceptor Panchen, Living Buddha Zhangjia, as well as party and state leaders and central figures, all of whom took refuge and supported. Adding to this the recent realization of domestic peace, the compilation and disbandment of puppet troops, and the takeover of war zones, the President of a certain academy urged the holding of [Universal Benefit Dharma Assemblies] to honor the fallen soldiers, etc. These enlightened people certainly know that it is all thanks to the boundless power of my Buddha and the miraculous manifestation of the sacred in the dark. And not to forget the young marshal, who besides his personal hobby of going abroad to propagate foreign Buddhist decrees, etc., all these factors naturally led Westerners to take refuge (the travelers at the pier who whispered in surprise at each other were truly ignorant of the times and did not understand the truth!) So this is a very gratifying thing, because from now on, the spirit of our Chinese nation's love of peace can be deeply instilled in the minds of these fifteen well-known and qualified Western living Bodhisattvas. After graduating and being ordained in two years, they will return to their countries in separate ways, spreading the teachings with great compassion, and warlike countries will naturally nod like stubborn rocks, lay down their butcher knives, and the whole world will become Buddhist! As for world peace, the Great Harmony, etc., that is not a problem.</p>
<p>Therefore, the significance of our welcome to [European] Buddhists coming to China for ordination] is extremely important, the mission is extremely great, and the value is extremely supreme! Because in this way, the ambitious countries can lay down their butcher knives against me, then I don't need to [repel] [externally] and can peacefully and single-mindedly devote all my strength to [pacifying internally], isn't that good! Isn't that wonderful!</p>

<h3>Bamboo Branch Verse of a Summer Night</h3>
<p>— Chengming</p>
<p>Cars circling in the afterglow of sunset and rosy clouds,</p>
<p>Modern men and women go for a drive,</p>
<p>Cars come and go like shuttles weaving,</p>
<p>Suddenly to the west, then to the east.</p>
<p>Lovers stroll hand-in-hand in the Bund Park,</p>
<p>Resting by the waterfront of the Whangpoo, where hearts can be written,</p>
<p>Dispelling worldly worries amidst a riot of flowers,</p>
<p>Cleansing the dust of the world in the depths of green shade.</p>
<p>Meat Screens</p>
<p>Seemingly a nude exhibition,</p>
<p>Summer nights are adorned in this way,</p>
<p>Try standing at street corners,</p>
<p>On both sides, countless meat screens.</p>
<p>Playing the Gallant</p>
<p>See the green wine and red lights,</p>
<p>Paper drunk and gold obsessed, boundless joy,</p>
<p>Snow lotus root and iced melon can be devoured,</p>
<p>White board parties and strokes all night long.</p>
<h3>The Future of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>To the point: [The future of Shanghai is one of extraordinary prosperity!] This does not require a Liu Bowen-style prophet to predict, nor scientists to prove. Except for emotionally unstable children and those with incomplete brains and no wit, everyone will trust it without a doubt. The current facts are clear evidence. Look, aren't banks, hotels, theaters, amusement parks, and large companies in the prosperous core increasing every year! Buildings have risen from three or five stories to the common ten or more stories. It is said that in the near future, twenty-four and thirty-two-story buildings will appear on Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road. Then, in thirty or fifty years, buildings like those in New York, fifty or sixty stories high, like Kunlun Mountains, will not be difficult to appear on the Bund. People who are familiar with Shanghai say that thirty years ago, Western Shanghai and Zhabei were still vast wastelands, and only horse-drawn carriages were seen crowding the streets. Even the richest man in East Asia, Hartong, only rode in a decorated horse-drawn carriage. What about now?</p>
<p>However, some people worry: [The future of Shanghai is not prosperity, but destruction.] For example, [January 28th] comes, then the French and American empires each do the same, and that would destroy quite a bit of Shanghai. If the empires engage in all-out war and a large-scale conflict occurs, even if World War II happens in Shanghai, then there is no doubt that it would be completely destroyed. I replied: Yes, yes, no, no, it will definitely not happen. First, because [non-resistance] and [long-term resistance] have already taken root and grown in our country. If the empires want to follow Japan's example, they might as well give the entire Shanghai to them unconditionally, so as not to provoke war. Shanghai can then continue to prosper. Second, it is said that Japan will surely destroy itself in ten years. Then, it is difficult to guarantee that the empires will not all perish together, and that will truly be our world. Even Dr. ×</p>
<p>has also instructed us to have confidence, [In fifty years, China will surely defeat Japan!] So what are we afraid of from other countries? Therefore, in the final analysis, Shanghai will never again see the outbreak of war, and the terror of destruction will not arrive.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, [The future of Shanghai is one of extraordinary prosperity!]</p>
<p>However, there are two distinct types of people who look forward to the arrival of this prosperity, with completely different perspectives and expectations. One is the wealthy who have cultivated good fortune for generations. They are eagerly anticipating Shanghai's even greater prosperity, hoping that it will surpass the European city of Paris and the American city of New York, a dazzling display of wealth that easily passes the time, with more ways to spend money. In terms of daily life, it is best to take a plane to a company building looming in the clouds to buy the latest things. Food should be delivered automatically to the stomach, and there should be no toilet. When wanting to excrete, there would be a machine or medicine to dissolve it. And beautiful women should best evolve to be used at will. As for temperature, it is best to have a [protective] air conditioner and heater that can be changed with the seasons and affect people, without installing heating and cooling pipes indoors, so that in the summer you have to climb Guling Mountain, and in the cold winter you have to wear heavy fur coats.</p>
<p>The other type is the poor who are often unable to get enough to eat and wear. They expect Shanghai to become more prosperous, first of all, that the food samples piled up in some large companies should not be thrown away or wasted, but should be available for everyone to enjoy as they wish. Secondly, they expect many free theaters and amusement parks to appear, where they can go to vent the accumulated depression in their hearts and slightly appreciate the arts. Again, they expect many primary schools, middle schools, and universities to be available for their children to study, and when they have free time, they themselves, like a 63-year-old elementary school student in Guangdong, can go in and light up a pair of old eyes. In addition, they can make cars and airplanes themselves, and they are qualified to ride in cars and airplanes. As for excretion and women, etc., as long as everyone squats on the toilet and each person has a yellow-faced wife to accompany them, they will be completely satisfied.</p>
<h3>Went to the Cinema</h3>
<p>— Hu</p>
<p>The car honked three times downstairs! !! Hey! Do you hear it? The car is here, the wife said coquettishly.</p>
<p>!! You go first, I'll be right there! A very heavy sound.</p>
<p>The telephone rang again, ring ring ring.</p>
<p>Hey, who is this? The wife hurriedly picked it up and asked.</p>
<p>!! They're calling you to play mahjong! How about it? The wife turned around and said to the husband.</p>
<p>!! Tell him I'll be there at nine o'clock!</p>
<p>The telephone hung down with a click.</p>
<p>The car honked again downstairs, woo woo woo, three times. Ah Ba! Watch the door! If someone comes looking for me, tell them I went to the movies and if it's something important, come to the fourth floor of the Zhongshan Hotel at nine o'clock.</p>
<p>The telephone rang again, ring ring ring.</p>
<p>!! Never mind him, let's go. Let Ah Ba answer it.</p>
<p>So, high heels and leather shoes went up the smooth stone steps side by side!</p>
<p>The cinema was so lively. The smell of sweat assaulted the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The wife's jade hand held the husband's old arm and got out of the car! Her face was full of a happy smile. The husband had reserved the box seat by telephone a long time ago. Inside the cinema, countless heads were moving up and down, and the smell of sweat kept spreading. Many young students, with coats over their arms, unbuttoned their shirts, revealing a sweat-soaked undershirt and the upper part of a red chest. They were sweating.</p>
<p>The wife passed by this side and said with a very displeased tone:</p>
<p>The cinemas in Guangzhou are really too bad. There isn't one that releases cold air to cool people down. It always makes people feel dizzy from the heat, suffocating them to death!</p>
<p>Guangzhou is always Guangzhou, of course it can't compare to Hong Kong! The husband said.</p>
<p>Really, Hong Kong is always Hong Kong, living in Hong Kong is so comfortable! When are we going to go to Hong Kong and stay for a week? No, it should be longer. Whenever, that goes without saying, right?</p>
<p>The two people sat in the box, with wooden boards on three sides. The electric fan was turning vigorously overhead. The two people's bodies drew close, closer, and they didn't feel hot at all.</p>
<p>After a while, the wife said coquettishly again:</p>
<p>Looking down, it really looks like a pile of black-headed wretches!</p>
<p>What are you looking at those poor saps for?</p>
<p>As he said this, the husband laughed happily, and the wife laughed along with him.</p>
<h3>The Youth Wandering on the Wrong Path</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>My younger brother sent a letter, saying that he had finally graduated from middle school amidst the turmoil of the entrance examination, and after several disputes, my mother reluctantly agreed to let him enter university. In the end, he playfully wrote: Brother, I am happier than you in this regard! Of course, under the customs of our hometown and my mother's stubborn nature, my brother was only involved in several disputes and was able to achieve the privilege of entering university. No matter how you put it, he is happier than any of you in this regard.</p>
<p>When I graduated from middle school, I was met with armed resistance from my family to force myself into university, and the supply of money was cut off. I was forced to step into the door of society after only a short year in the palace of the university. But aren't people of my generation now all university graduates? What happens after graduating from university? They marry wives and prepare to be fathers at home. My younger brother has the happiness of stepping into university, but not the happiness of sitting comfortably and eating his fill. So, I didn't reply to his excited letter, fearing that it would hurt his pure and innocent heart, and let him explore the palace of university with the pride of happiness!</p>
<p>But this is four years of life, after which he will inevitably be forced into the door of society. Although I don't know if Chinese society will be better in four years than it is now, he will inevitably suffer, or even more than before entering university. I seem to see him exploring profound books, searching through all kinds of dictionaries for the meaning of a word, and arranging papers full of complicated equations for the sake of a numerical error. He is not afraid of the heat or hardship, and they are thinking about realizing his beautiful dream.</p>
<p>However, this dream will soon be shattered. Rather than let him suffer later, it is better to suffer earlier. So, I want to bring up the matter and try to give him some warning, often spending a whole day trying to find better wording, because he thinks that entering university is happiness.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the economic downturn in society and the economic bankruptcy of the countryside, groups of people are struggling in this irredeemable flood. My younger brother does not have the happiness of sitting comfortably and eating his fill. Rather than joining the ranks of the unemployed in the future, which will be ten times larger than it is now, it would be better to use the funds for entering university to work hard on his own career, but how can I save a young person wandering on the wrong path?</p>

<h3>How Should Shop Assistants Resist?</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>A few days ago, I carefully read the letter from Mr. Luo Zhensen published in the shop assistants' correspondence column, asking for advice, and your clever answer. Indeed, this problem not only exists among Mr. Luo's colleagues but also among my own. I think it probably accounts for more than 90 percent of the business world.</p>
<p>I am in the same position as Mr. Luo, having completed my apprenticeship but not receiving a salary. Our manager is also short-sighted.</p>
<p>Now, capitalists exploit us so much, and we should rise up to resist those who exploit us. But capitalists do not benefit from exploiting us like this. As you said in your answer to Mr. Luo, ["But to expect loyalty is probably a dream."] This statement is very true.</p>
<p>You said in your last sentence to Mr. Luo, ["Don't say that all Chinese people are weak. Among dozens of people, isn't there even one strong person? I really don't believe it, Mr. Luo, you just wait."], this statement is indeed correct. But in the current situation, how can we show our strength? Mr. Luo's main question lies in this sentence. I think that if we unite the apprentices and staff in the shop to resist together, but there are relatives of the manager among them (this is based on my shop), and puppets who flatter the manager. Even if a few of you resist, there are still some people remaining. Moreover, there are many unemployed people now, and there is a surplus of labor everywhere. It is extremely easy to recruit and hire a few people. To unite and organize all the apprentices and staff in Shanghai (the staff are also exploited by the manager, so it is also possible to unite the staff), I think it is impossible in the current situation. Because all the finances are controlled by the capitalists, they naturally have money and power. They can control our lives. Isn't this too weak? But as mentioned above, they have puppets to help them. If one person rises up in anger, as a strong person, to resist, this action will break their rice bowl. The hateful capitalists will just say, "Get out!"</p>
<p>Recently, in my shop, a brother who entered the shop only ten-odd days before me, because he had completed his apprenticeship but did not receive a salary, and was repeatedly subjected to the capitalist's threatening and abusive language, and all sorts of unbearable humiliation, mustered his courage, left the shop, and went home. When he left, because he was usually very close to me, he also said to me, ["Heaven never cuts off all means of survival. Will I starve to death if I leave the exploitative shop where the capitalist brandishes his power! Even if I starve to death, dying in my hometown is enough for me to be content."]</p>
<p>Sir, can be considered ? I don't know if someone is behind him . Who is the first to ask you to give me a detailed explanation later.</p>
<p>Answer: Resistance is certainly not of the verbal, individual, scattered, impulsive, chaotic kind, but should be active, whole, collective, purposeful, and organized. The letter says that someone quit his job and went home because he was not paid by the shop. That is not resistance, but surrender, a blind action! How can we see this? Resistance requires struggle. For example, if the Japanese come to attack us, we should immediately fight back. Whether we can win or not is another question, but our need to fight back is undeniable. Use all our strength to fight back to the end. Whether we win or lose, we must not give up until the last breath. This is called resistance. If we see the Japanese coming and we let them, saying, "Okay! You are fierce, I'll let you have your way, let's see if you can hit me again." Saying that, they retreat back into the pass in a puff of smoke. Then he is still very proud and says: "Look how fierce you Japanese are, now you can't hit me." Although this kind of person preserves his life and property, can we say that his action is an act of resistance? Of course not, absolutely not! How is the action of the person mentioned in the letter, who resigned and returned home because he did not want to be oppressed by the shop, different from this? Therefore, what I mean by resistance is to take practical action, gather people of the same interests and the same class, and attack the oppressors in an organized manner with clear goals. Its strength must be concentrated, its members must be pure, its organization must be strict, and its actions must have a certain rhythm. Only in this way can we achieve the effect of resistance, and only then can it be considered resistance! If you arbitrarily act on the temporary impulse of one or two people, make a fuss, or passively retreat, like the person mentioned in the letter, that is not resistance, it is simply child's play! This is one. Secondly, it is common to discover rebellious elements in mass movements, especially in the petty bourgeoisie. In the entire social revolution, this entire class is the most rebellious. At a certain period, this petty bourgeoisie often breaks away from the revolutionary masses and goes over to the counter-revolutionary camp, even selling out revolutionary interests. There are countless examples in history. It is not that the petty bourgeoisie is particularly bad, but that its entire class nature commands it to do so. Since the nature of the entire petty bourgeoisie is so unstable, it is naturally very difficult to seek unity within this class, and rebellious elements are particularly numerous. This is really unavoidable. However, it is not entirely without a solution. It depends on the ability of the leader of this movement. If there is a capable leader, coupled with strict organization, making every effort to eliminate floating elements, and using strict measures to punish rebellious elements, it may not be impossible to concentrate strength and unleash a great revolutionary movement. This is two. In short, mass movements are not easy, but require considerable hard work to achieve considerable results. Failures in the middle are absolutely unavoidable. The more you can withstand failure, the more concentrated your strength will be. If you are afraid of failure, then please don't even talk about it!</p>

<h3>Under the Traffic Lights (38)</h3>
<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>(21) The Day We Avenge Our Hatred Will Surely Come. Li Shiqiao returned home quickly last night, and spent the entire long night in sleepless, anxious thoughts. Meizi, who always gets up especially early, seized the opportunity to push open his door while it was still just dawning. Her purpose was only to see if Shiqiao had returned last night and how he was sleeping, as if she could be comforted just by seeing him. Unexpectedly, Shiqiao was not sleeping, but was staring at the gradually transparent glass window. Meizi walked in and gently asked, "Did you wake up so early?" Shiqiao wanted to sit up and hug her, but he suddenly realized that since he had fallen out of favor with the Third Concubine, should he compensate Meizi and vent his feelings on her? This would simply be an insult to Meizi, so he pretended to be very indifferent and replied to Meizi, "Good morning!" In fact, Shiqiao's desire to hug Meizi was a natural expression of genuine affection. Excessive self-reflection, doubts, and hesitation often clouded his true soul. This can be said to be the inferior nature of intellectuals in general, and Shiqiao was even more severely made unproductive by this inferior nature. When Meizi noticed his indifference and quietly left, he immediately regretted it and felt a vague sense of loss. Gradually, regret turned into hatred. This hatred was directed at the licentious Third Concubine, and even at Wang Hua the dwarf. Then, a lewd imagination, a disgusting fantasy about Sanhua and the Third Concubine, again tormented his mind, which had been suffering all night. At this time, seeing the morning sunlight, it seemed as if the sunlight was further exposing his shame, and the pain in his heart deepened, and he clenched his fists in both hands and sat up unconsciously. Suddenly, Ah Zhen brought a cup of tea in and said:</p>
<p>"I heard you moving around in your room very early in the kitchen downstairs! I knew you were up." She placed the teacup on the small round table and continued:</p>
<p>"There's no one at home these past two days: Old Master Yang is busy and hasn't come back, and even Madam didn't come home to sleep last night. That thing, Changfa, since he was slapped by the Master that day, packed his bedding and left on his own. Leaving only me to guard this empty house!" After saying this, she tilted her head, which was almost her habitual flattering pose. But because Shiqiao's stern face showed no hint of a smile, she left without getting what she wanted.</p>
<p>By the time Shiqiao looked up again, the red morning sun had already stained the glass window. The newspaper boys were already running and shouting on the street.</p>
<p>"Want to see the great battle at Jiangwan last night? Want to see the Japanese suffer defeat!" He seemed to be startled by the sound of these newspaper calls. War, war, war, re-entered his consciousness and re-ignited his emotions. In the rear, which had forgotten the war, the corrupt environment of this rear had turned him into a vortex, unconsciously consuming the excitement of the war. What a decadent life he was living, how unworthy of the brave front lines. He re-awakened to his true position - social responsibility, national duty. So he decided to find a way to go to the front lines. No matter the cost of sacrificing himself at the front lines, even just to change the air at the front lines would be good. At least it would wash away the filth he had acquired in the rear. So he made up his mind and prepared an official letter in the name of the ×××× Association, saying that he was being sent as a representative to comfort the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army at the front. His spirit was lifted, and he quickly dressed, had breakfast at the restaurant, and then went to the 19th Route Army Headquarters, where a department vehicle sent him to the front.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Set Design in Chinese Films</h3>
<p>— Mi Wu</p>
<p>Humans can never be independent of the world. Then, since film is a reflection of human social life, it certainly cannot be separated from the world. On the screen, what represents this is the set design. In the stage design for theatrical performances, the set design occupies an absolutely important position. However, in any case, the set design in stage plays is always more symbolic. This is naturally due to various practical difficulties that make it impossible to do otherwise. As for film, it is absolutely not like that. It needs great realism, the realism of "film time and space," and at the same time, it uses photographic technology to make all set designs lifelike. But have Chinese films achieved this? The answer is simple: absolutely not. Now, let's not talk about the jokes of small companies' paper-pasted houses and walls moving in the wind. Let's first examine the set designs of the so-called big companies.</p>
<p>First, what I find unsatisfactory is the non-reality of the set designs. It seems that interior decoration is almost all that can be seen besides the set design. In portraying the home of a wealthy person, such extravagant decoration can still be unfortunate. Every time portraying the home of a "salaryman" who lives "from hand to mouth," it is also such a novel set. Especially contradictory is that in "Langu Pingzong," the pavilion in the cramped room is as exquisite as the study of a young master from a wealthy family. It really doesn't make sense. Such set designs easily make the viewer feel [it's just watching a play], a disillusionment with reality, and lose the desired effect.</p>
<p>Second, they cannot be integrated with the plot. We know that the performance of slums or poor peasant families is nothing more than to allow the audience to further and concretely understand the living conditions of the poor and peasants. Therefore, we should try our best to express their desolation, dilapidation, filth, and mess, so that the audience can connect these with the entire plot and the life characteristics of the characters, and form a unified realistic impression. We should absolutely not chant the beauty of nature, turning a stinking pool next to a slum into a sparkling wave, and adding a smiling peach tree next to the water. Or, in a dilapidated rural village, add a few fat geese and swallows. This is not to say that slums and bankrupt rural villages should not have these things, but putting these things in films about the oppressed and the harmed will ease or dissolve the audience's emotional agitation. Moreover, the beauty and ugliness of objective existence will also vary depending on subjective emotions. Since films need to be viewed through the eyes of the audience, the producers should think about whether the audience's emotions will still appreciate the beauty of nature at this time (when seeing this story)!</p>
<p>The above are the main shortcomings of the current set design in Chinese films. In addition, there are some set designs that cannot be done well in practice, and our producers should avoid them as much as possible. Like in "Volcano Passion," in the scene of the volcano, knowing that the set design of the volcano is a joke, then the smart director doesn't have to let the volcano appear on the screen. As we see it, if the death of the landlord's son was a fall from the mountain, then not only would there be no obstacle in the plot, but also the lack of reason for the volcano to have already erupted and the two still running towards the volcano, and the coincidence of falling into the crater, could be avoided. Unfortunately, our director just doesn't do this.</p>

<h3>Review of "Perfect Understanding"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Now Showing at Guanglu 丨 Garden</p>
<p>In terms of the overall performance, such directing techniques will not surprise us much. However, some characteristics can also be found in it. For example, at the beginning, writing about the male and female protagonists singing love songs by the lake, the description of that romance is not necessarily the director's proud technique, but in order for this love song not to end quickly, and not being able to use techniques such as "Peach Blossom Village" or "School Love Life" to match the picture that is more suitable for the lyrics, it makes people feel that this scene is too long, and at the same time, it is difficult for Shi Huangsheng's performance. For another example, the female protagonist and the explorer talk and walk in the corridor, while the discord between other couples progresses at the same time, to increase the change in the protagonist's mood. This technique is very economical. The court scene is naturally also relatively good, especially in the midst of the bailiff shouting "Mr. Nick and Mrs. Nick," the divorced couple seize the opportunity to escape, which is indeed novel and interesting, contributing to the comedy ending, but it is also light and laughable. As for the boat race, it is certainly very lively, like a newsreel. Maybe many people are very happy to watch it, but it is just such a crude insertion, let alone taking up a very long time, and it finally cannot reconcile the dull plot of the whole film. It even causes a feeling of displeasure. Apart from these points, the others are mediocre, and completely consistent with other old methods, but with minor differences.</p>
<p>I think that the director's handling of the personalities of the characters in the play is most insufficient for that explorer. Indeed, John Harriet's sinister face, like in "Terrorist Boat," can greatly show his treachery, but since he is in love with the heroine, why is there no enthusiastic expression at all? Moreover, why should an explorer who is enthusiastic about science be so treacherous?</p>
<p>Shi Huangsheng's (Gloria Swanson) reputation will never be forgotten in the memory of movie fans. She has her strengths, and we cannot deny her proficiency in technique. The so-called "old-fashioned elegance" also increases her appeal. But unfortunately, not every actor can get the mystery of "staying young," so people can't help but feel "spring is passing." Just as Mary Pickford lost the youth of a girl in "Secrets," Shi Huangsheng cannot use makeup to recover her beautiful face. However, these are all digressions. The main thing is that she is no longer suitable for playing young girls. The latter part is obviously more natural than the first part.</p>
<p>"Content determines form," this sentence always exists. A boring love dispute cannot make the performance a great success after all. If we must seek the meaning of preaching in the dispute, then the so-called marriage is the tomb of love, or that couples should respect each other's freedom, etc., cannot be separated from the economic foundation and made as deceptive explanations. Then this "Perfect Understanding" will certainly not allow the couples to gain any benefits.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Old House Scandal"</h3>
<p>— Mi Wu</p>
<p>In modern society, in addition to prostitutes who sell their bodies, and poor women who often use their bodies as capital to obtain a small amount of money to supplement their labor income, there are also those women with leisure who frantically pursue sexual satisfaction. Therefore, being reflected in movies, films centered on sexual love emerge in endlessly, and "The Old House Scandal" is also such a film.</p>
<p>The story is about a romantic woman who uses her body to seduce and manipulate many men, and is finally murdered by a man who has been manipulated. A group of gentlemen who enjoyed themselves with her are discovered by detectives as accomplices and are all imprisoned.</p>
<p>Originally, formal marriages have gradually decreased in European and American countries. This point proves that individualism has developed to the extreme, has broken through the monogamous marriage system stipulated by established laws. And Wu Xing's romance, as well as the decadent hedonism of the declining period of "Life's Geometry," make them step on the road of self-destruction day by day, and perform meaningless tragedies. What else does "The Old House Scandal" tell us besides explaining the above points?</p>
<p>Indeed, "the emptiness of content determines the mediocrity of form." In the technical aspect of "The Old House Scandal," we see that the old film art has become thoroughly rotten and is beginning to decay. The director is trying hard to make the structure peculiar and give this film a horror atmosphere. However, this point is not fully achieved. In addition, the story does not have a more serious and grand meaning, and cannot allow the audience to grasp the correct consciousness, but only uses changing shots to dazzle the audience's eyes. His failure is inevitable.</p>
<p>Actress Kai Malan is the best in terms of actors. She perfectly expresses the state of a romantic woman. This is perhaps an example of the so-called "self-exposure"! Li Kadu Jia is also very good.</p>
<h3>Spectacle in the Sky</h3>
<p>— Ping Ye</p>
<p>Air Mail Mystery is about a retired pilot, Li Bo, and his friend, Xin Shi, jointly mining the "Venus" gold mine, and transporting the gold they obtained to the mint by plane, and being robbed by an aerial bandit named "Black Hawk," who flies a black plane in the sky. This happened five times in total, giving the planes on the screen a chance to perform, and creating this so-called aerial spectacle. Although the content of the story makes people feel monotonous and ordinary, the visual satisfaction given to the audience on the screen is real.</p>
<p>This is because the plane has gotten many opportunities to perform on the screen. The author of "Spectacle in the Sky" being able to focus on the description of the plane is indeed an easy way to please the audience.</p>
<p>The most tense scene in the film is the confrontation between airplanes in the sky, cars chasing cars on the ground, shooting guns, and horses chasing horses. The director uses lively shots in a detailed and powerful manner, bringing the situation on the screen to the highest point, causing the audience's emotions to fall into terror and panic. Secondly, scenes such as Li Bo and his lover, Mary, being injured twice, and Zhan Fei, who was captured by the Black Hawk, escaping and helping Li Bo and others fight the gang, are also quite spectacular. Here, I will say in advance that the photographic technology has helped the director succeed a lot.</p>
<p>The performance of the plane is the only advantage in the performance aspect of this film, so every plane performance scene is the most important scene in the film. Here, the flying skills of the three planes are very sophisticated, and there are some dangerous and terrifying performances, such as Li Bo's plane crashing into the water. The most beautiful thing on the screen is the close-up shots of the black plane of the big thief landing several times. At the same time, we can also see some interesting insertions, such as Xin Shi's old car stopping halfway due to the cylinder being too hot.</p>
<p>As for the meaning of the film, it is of course to arouse the audience's interest in aviation. The story contains a strong preaching atmosphere of not being afraid of difficulties and defeating the enemy, and it is for the sake of the gold mine, which is very clichéd. This is somewhat similar to those so-called martial arts films made for gold and beauties.</p>
<h3>An Ugly Pair</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Old star Mary Transch is a famous old ugly woman in Hollywood. She became the Hollywood film queen at the age of sixty-odd. She has always considered the first confidant to be Hua Leispi Lei, who is also one of the ugliest male stars in Hollywood. An ugly man and an ugly woman have added a lot of laughter to the film scene. Now, in order to fulfill the friendship between the two, MGM has specially invited them to co-star in a film called Tugboot Annioo. There are no beautiful women or handsome men with male typologies inside. All that is there is a pair of ugly stars performing an ugly film. Hollywood does not know how much laughter this film has caused.</p>
<h3>Renovation and Closure of Beijing Grand Theater</h3>
<p>Recently, the Beijing Grand Theater in this city has been working hard to collect and present domestic films to the audience. Now, due to the hot weather and the oppressive heat, the theater is at the time of its three-year renovation as usual, so it is also taking the opportunity to temporarily close its business to refresh the interior and renovate everything. It can be completed in half a month. It is heard that the latest domestic blockbuster, "The Light of Motherhood," will be selected and screened at that time.</p>
<h3>Tour of European and American Photography Studios (9)</h3>
<p>— Yun Yan</p>
<p>It was already quite remarkable that they had produced films thirty-four years ago; but even more remarkable is that Gaumont had produced sound films thirty years ago. In 1902, they filmed and simultaneously recorded gramophone records of the actors' speech and movements to match it, calling this method "Chronophone." These films were shown in London and elsewhere. Before 1913, Gaumont was always filming in Dulwich. The Shepherd's Bush studio was not completed until 1914, and it was called the "Glass Studio." However, in 1929, the wave of sound films shook the film industry worldwide, and the internal equipment was greatly changed.</p>
<p>Gaumont was enterprising, and by the spring of 1932, a new studio was completed next to the "Glass Studio." This is the largest and most modern energy facility, with the roof about ninety feet above the ground. There are five filming theaters, dressing rooms for six hundred male actors, and dressing rooms for female stars, all of which are very comfortable and complete. In addition, there are three private theaters; a composing room; nine film storage rooms; a six-hundred-seat restaurant; a plumbing and carpentry workshop, and a recording studio, etc. They spent nearly half a million pounds on this photography studio, but they are still adding new studios there!</p>
<p>(12) Joinville (France)</p>
<p>丨Paramount French Studio in Joinville near Paris丨</p>
<p>In a large piece of countryside, a slow-moving stream meanders through the quiet pasture, where herds of calves often graze. Nearby is a large river, with beautiful painted boats traveling back and forth. The noise of the fields, the oars of boats on the water, and the sounds of machines in the studio combine together. That is the scene in Joinville, where Paramount's French studio is built. In the place of Joinville, there are these natural beauty, so sometimes there is no need to build background when filming. In fact, it was really too good. One day, they needed a group of lambs, so they forced the lambs on the pasture to be extras. On the ground, there is a very lovely grass and many beautiful old trees, full of the air of the old world. In front of the photography studio is the railway, from Paris to there, it takes only half an hour. (To be continued)</p>
