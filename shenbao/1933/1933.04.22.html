<p>時評</p>
<h3>平津危急動</h3>
<p>當九一八禍變發生之初國内與論頗多主張運用外交。對日作和平之談判以免事態擴張。而於拚死抗戰之主張。則認爲高調。認爲不量力。爲感情用事。甚且有人謂應澈底信賴國聯。保持國際間正義屬於我方之信心。以靜候最後之勝利。凡此種種之錯誤主張都由於錯認九一八禍變之動機。爲日本少數跋扈之軍閥所造成之偶發事件而根本未能正確理解經濟恐慌下之國際形勢。尤根本未能正確理解處於經濟恐慌狂潮激盪下之帝國主義者企圖重新分割殖民地之必然。故以爲以和平之方式。對日作有條件之談判。同時借助國際條約。予日本以壓力。東北變動。即可獲得解决。吾人亦即可獲得暫時之苟安此一種幻夢今日應已爲殘酷之事實所撃破此種錯誤之觀察。今日亦應爲殘酷之事實所糾正。</p>
<p>吾人自前年九一八以來。即堅决認定　變之爆發。爲日帝國主義者有計劃有步驟之侵略行爲。同時更堅决認定所謂國際條約。皆爲欺騙弱者之符咒。而且在經濟恐慌狂潮之下。列强自顧不暇。亦决不能予我以若何之助力。故一貫的堅决主張。以自力謀自助自救。以澈底之抗爭。維護我民族之生存。以民族革命戰爭。答覆日帝國主義者之侵略暴行。任何犠牲任何艱苦。都應忍受。此種堅定之主張。一年半以來嶄然如鐵之事實。亦已證明其爲絶對不誤。</p>
<p>今日灤東又已陷落。平津已成朝不保夕之勢。政府要人對於古物。尚不忍爲敵人所刧奪蹂𨈆而亟思所以保全。則對於今日華北土地人民之陷於危境。不知將如何防衛。對於平津。不知將用何法以謀保全。倘若始終不作堅决之打算。則吾人誠愚。莫知其可。蓋極日帝國主義者之野心。我民族即欲得一隅以苟安。已不可能。此則可以九一八以來敵人得寸進尺之事實證明者也。　　亡國之禍。迫近眉睫。其待死乎。抑將拚死以求生乎。環顧河山。曷勝悲痛。具有五千年悠遠歷史之民族。今日豈已消失其維護生存之能力。是不敢信。仰亦不忍信。國人乎。吾人今日究應如何。</p>

<h3>美聲明並無政治作用</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯二十一日紐約電國務院電告駐外各大使公使、令其向駐在國政府說明、美國放棄金本位、純由於國内經濟狀况所致、并無其他作用、俾美國在未來經濟談話中所處地位、爲之鞏固云、</p>

<h3>美金滙價暴跌之原因</h3>
<p>國民二十日倫敦電頃據外匯界可靠消息、邇來美金在世界匯兌市場之暴跌、其原因雖不一、而大半由於歐洲大陸某投機財團向金元猛烈進攻所致、此投機財團之資本、大部份出於紐約方面、因曾受兩次巨創、亟　恢復、乃向金元繼續進攻、故外滙界中早曾有人預料將有此次之暴跌、大約在一月前、即已覺到苟非華盛頓政府發一宣言作完滿之解釋、及倫敦金融界出而擁護金元、則美金滙市恐將有意外之變化、至歐陸之投機財團、係於英國放棄金本位時組織、業使數國貨幣爲之貶値、當其組織之後、即開始抛售英鎊、但其後曾曹巨創、又當三月初美國禁金出口時、該投機團亦居空頭地位、聞在美銀行停市十日内、其抛售數曾逹三萬五千萬金元之鉅、但其縝密計劃之襲撃行動又告失敗、美金仍得保持陣線、若輩被迫補進、又蒙重大損失、遂乃靜待報復機會、迨近日華盛頓方面旣無足以鼓勵市况之宣言、倫敦方面雖亟欲設穽以創此投機財團、願在必要時與紐約合作以維持美金、顧美政府突然决定不再維持金元價格、致無合作之可能、至目前該投機團在匯市中所居地位、尚在未定之天、但倫敦金融專家皆信其將試圖恢復前此之損失、按當美國窖金者開始將金貨返諸銀行時、此間皆信金元可無加以人力擁護之必要、其後外間雖有膨脹通貨聲浪、而此間皆信美國將圖維持金元價格、一俟美銀行復業之後、立可保持水平線、不虞此時之頓放棄金本位也、至該投機團聞在紐約巴黎漢堡倫敦均有機關、其勢力之偉大、曾使金融界感受許多不安云、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社二十日巴黎電（小巴黎人）報接獲駐美通訊員拍來海電、謂英美兩國間、現方舉行（貨幣大决鬭、）美金之跌落、足使羅斯福總統在策略上極佔優勢、當今世界各國貨幣、除法郎以外、皆不穩定、國際貿易欲其繁榮、自不可能、英國方面最爲感受痛苦、將極力求各國貨幣之穩定、但若英國不能與美國妥協、則美幣或將繼續跌落至極低程度、果爾、美國貨物價格、則亦將隨之低落、而爲英國商業之大患矣云云、</p>

<h3>紐約市塲空前活躍</h3>
<p>巴黎亦起反響</p>

<p>哈瓦斯二十日巴黎電美金跌落之後、此間市塲、發生反動、其情形幾與紐約市場無異、各種證券皆漲、尤以外國證券爲甚、僅法國公債呆滯、間有跌落一點以上者、美金正式標價、爲二十二法郎四十五生丁、銀價大漲、</p>

<p>路透二十一日華沙電維克公司英技師孟克賀斯等三人今日午後一時一刻抵波蘭邊界車站、歡迎者頗衆、除英人新聞記者外、波蘭軍人亦來歡迎、英技師在餐館進餐後、即於午後二時零五分乘車赴華沙與柏林、尋常俄國政治偵察局輙派人押送被逐出境者直至邊界、但此次則異是、而以普通行客待遇之、各技師皆不願發表意見、故新聞記者咸爲之失望、</p>

<h3>檢察官之論告</h3>
<p>十時二十分、法官訊問完畢、檢察官朱携、卽起立提起論告、略謂本案被告陳獨秀等十人、被捕經過、已於起訴書中述明、並對被告十人之犯罪證據加以說明、</p>
<p>（陳獨秀）他供過民國九年加入共産黨、十一年任總秘書長職、十六年清共、共黨失敗、因他工作無成績、致被開除總秘書長職、十八年因傾向托洛斯基派、被開除黨籍、彭述之·王子平·何阿芳·等、傾向托派、亦均被開除、因此共同組織中國共産黨左派反對派、查被告之被開除、是被史丹林派開除、並非完全脫離共産黨、史托兩派不同的地方、是史派說暴動時期已到、托派說還没有到、在策略上托派主張紅軍應以農工爲基礎、史派則連土匪盜賊都參加在内、在手段上、史派主張國民黨分子亦司加入、托派主張國共應分開、凡此種種、都是内部問題、在法律點上、他們主張打倒國民政府、和無産階級專政、是一様的、目的都是共産、都是危害民國、被告供過、說他們現在勢力不大、祇有幾百人、分子以工界爲多、學界次之、農村尚無力量走進、與第三國際並無關係、這些在證據上看來、可以相信、又被告自認組織共黨、以前開會是去的、並任首席黨委、所以被告負有兩個責任、（一）組織左派反對派、他是主腦、所以無論宣傳命令、他都要負責、被告個人之言論著述、當然亦要負責、（二）宣傳部分、他們有一個系統向一個目標進行、著作很多、被告當然亦要負責、著作中重要者、以共同名義及個人名義發表者、有政治决議案·目前的局勢與我們的任務·五卅七週紀念告民衆書·對時局宣言·組委通告·爲日本帝國主義進攻上海告民衆書·爲日本佔領淞滬告全國民衆·滬東區委員爲日本在上海進行大屠殺告民衆書·北京特委最近工作計劃·中國將往何處去·此是抗日救國運動的康莊大路·國聯第二次决議後之局勢·爲紀念五一告工友等、以上之内容、均利用外交、攻撃國民政府、使國府威信隨地、不能領導羣衆、應由其領導農工及無産階級等、以武裝暴動、組織農工軍、設立蘇維埃政權、推翻國民政府、由無産階級專政、並欲打倒資本家、没收土地、分配貧農、破壤政治及經濟組織、故爲危害民國、毫無疑義、綜納被告之主張、共有四階段、（一）組織團體、（二）宣傅、（三）武裝暴動、（四）無産階級專政、但是被告之行爲、在第二階段中、至第三階段現在還辦不到、綜合所述、被告實犯危害民國緊急治罪法第六條及第二條第二欵、</p>
<p>（彭述之）彭述之犯罪情節、與陳獨秀同、他於民國十年在長沙加入共産黨後、因内部分裂被開除、十八年與陳獨秀同組左派反對派、任常委、職權與陳相同、二十一年十月十五日在謝少珊家開每週之常會被捕、他自供承認組織左派反對派、在宣傳方面、亦與陳獨秀負同一責任、故所引犯罪條文、亦與陳獨秀同、</p>
<p>（王武）原名宋逢春、民國十四年加入共黨、任宣傅工作、後因意見不同、被開除、去年五月化名劉夢庚、與鄭超麟組織共黨機關、被淞滬警備司令部捕獲、判處徒刑六年、送江蘇第二監獄執行、去年十二月五日因病保釋、十五日又被捕、前面的一段、他自已己承認、後面的一段、他不承認、就是他不承認去參加開會、也不承認是候補常委、但是謝少珊在高二分院供過、常委五人、是陳獨秀·彭述之·濮一凡·羅世凡·宋逢春·宋是第五人、方由漕河涇監獄放出、參加開會、還是第一次、又供王武就是宋逢春、又本處偵查時問遇陳獨秀、他說常委五人、三個正式、兩個候補、一個是濮一凡、還有一個是羅世凡、還是宋逢春、記不清楚、又彭述之供遇候補是濮一凡·宋逢春、所以王武是候補常委、並且是重犯、亦無疑義、實犯危害民國緊急治罪法第六條之罪、</p>
<p>（濮一凡）他也是在謝少珊家被捕、他否認是共産黨、但是謝少珊供過、他是候補常委、又陳獨秀也說過、候補常委第一個是濮一凡、第二個記不清楚、彭述之也供過、濮是候補常委、現在陳彭都否認此說、測其原因、陳是首領、自已顧負責、對他手下的、則想法開脫而已、被告所引條文、亦是危害民國緊急治罪法第六條、</p>
<p>（王子平）被告承認十六年加入共産黨、同年十月赴俄、後來被開除、據他供說、被開除後、卽未加入托派、但是火花·校内生活刋物、他却印過、共黨是很嚴的、如果他不加入、何能呌他負責印刷、所以他亦加入、且帮助叛國宣傅、毫無疑義、犯罪所引條文、與陳獨秀彭述之同、</p>
<p>（何阿芳）被告犯罪情形與王子平相同、所引條文亦同、</p>
<p>（王兆羣）被告說他是南宿州人、因友人李思昌之介紹、囑其到上海尋謝少珊謀事、卽寓居謝家中、謝在高二分院供過、他的家就是托派中央機關、被告如與他們没有關係、何能讓其住在那裹、又上海公安局證人陸文虎供說、搜捕時、他們像在開會、每人手裹拿一枝墨水筆、一本簿子、所以他有重大嫌疑、又陸供、王兆羣卽是羅世凡、也是常委之一、又謝少珊在高二分院供過、常委五人、都被捕了、没有一人逃脫、由此可見被告如非常委、何能出席常會、所以王兆羣就是羅世凡、就是常委、亦無異義、實犯危害民國緊急治罪法第六條之罪、</p>
<p>（郭競豪）卽彭道之、從共産黨學校豋記表上看出、他是二十三歲、十四年在長沙加入共黨、十八年加入托派、以前担任學生運動、加入托派後、從事滬東區區委·及學生運動、亦犯危害民國緊急治罪法第六條之罪、</p>
<p>（梁有光）被捕時在夜深、他從窗口跳出、被捕後經公安局查明他是共黨廣西視察員、方由廣西視察回來、他住的地方、就是羅世凡的家、則被告是共産黨員、已有相當證據、犯罪所引條文與上同、</p>
<p>（王鑑堂）在他家内搜出許多反動文件、他歷次供詞前後不符、且其姓名與搜出之共黨中央機關通信之姓名、却相符合、其爲共産黨員亦屬顯明、犯罪所引條文與上同、</p>
<p>以上對各被告犯罪證據已說明、又本院前曾承審牛蘭案、牛蘭是史丹林派、與現在贛鄂皖豫閩粤湘各省共匪暴動有直接關係、本案各被告、則並無關係、情節似屬較輕、判决時請庭上酌量、</p>
<h3>陳獨秀提抗辯</h3>
<p>檢察官提論告畢、時已下午一時四十五分、庭上即傳陳獨秀訊問是否尚有抗辯、陳答、當然要抗辯、繼卽述其理由、略謂檢察官論告、謂我危害民國、因爲我要推翻國民黨和國民政府但是我祗承認反對國民黨和反對國民政府却不承認危害民國、因爲政府並非國家、反對政府並非危害國家、例如滿清政府、曾自認朝廷卽是國家、北洋政府、亦自認代表國家、但是孫中山黃興等曾推倒滿清、推倒北洋政府、如謂推倒政府就是危害國家、那末國民黨豈非已叛國兩次、但是這句話誰都不能承認、因爲滿清政府和北洋政府、根本不能算是國家、因此在理論上、我們反對國民黨反對國民政府、並不能卽認爲危害民國云云、其次、陳卽再述其反對國民黨與國民政府之理由三點、（一）人民不自由、（二）貪官汚吏橫行、（三）政府不能澈底抗日、故不得不反對云云、繼又述其主張、謂主張無産階級專政、組織蘇維埃政府、並不危害民國、因以蘇俄爲事業之證明、蘇俄政府殊爲强固、卽美國德國亦不如之、國人對蘇維埃三字現視爲洪水猛獸、此與同治光緒年間、視鐵路爲洪水猛獸者、情形相同、我們現在宣傅組織蘇維埃政府、或者许多人反對、且亦不爲法律所贊同、但不能因不贊同、卽說是叛國云云、故法庭如對人民之政治思想、加以判斷、卽非人民之法庭、而成爲宗教式之法庭、所以檢察官之控告、根本不能成立、應請庭上宣判無罪云云、</p>

<p>關於（農村裹回得去嗎）問題</p>
<p>討論函件一束</p>
<p>（十四）本埠李馥君來信</p>
<p>（農村裹回得去嗎）的問題。引起很多讀者討論。除尤懹臯先生積極勸誘人們回去外，其餘都對於（回去）懹疑。張梅君先生提出反駁的四項理由。農村不能去。至少也難得去。又說（改造社會）。改造整個社會。有志的青年們應該向那條奮門的路上走。個人主義的新村式的改造運動。已經是過時的了。那末。請問張先生。城市裹旣站不住。農村裹又不能回去。（那條奮門的路一在那裹。我是贊成尤先生的話。（整千整萬的各國回來的留學生及大事中學的畢業生。應該担任教育農村興復農村的責任。）理由是。我國是廣大的農業國。四萬萬人農民要占三萬六七千萬。農民没有組織，奮門參加政權的知識和能力。農村是不會復興的。我們的生活，建築在農村裹的成分要占絶大部份。自然找個人生活。應有多數回到廣大的農村去。不應都向狹隘的城市裹混。回農村去是對的。但尤先生講的回農村去的辦法。太老生常談了，打不破目前社會的沉悶。結果不免是失望。像那位長沙老先生一様。我們不要說那位老先生走錯了路。他那（把精力和教課所得的　（以本黨不在　　　地方　　各　　　）　後、再來亞　　全文　　　有　、　　　　我　會、杜絶我直　、　　　　　、　　　亞各　　務工作人員、無論當地委員、　　代表　　被捕、　解出境、至　　　　　務　是乎亡　、此　　　之一　、特　之以告　同志、尚望中央　　補救之方、以　恢復十九年以前之原狀則　矣、</p>

<p>俸錢，都用在那月農村學校上。）對的。够人佩服的。其不能有多大成績乃是辦法上的問題。辦法是針對着事實來的。農村破産。城市恐慌。滿坑滿谷像雄聲君失衆的及找不到業的人。原因很明白。是帝國主義封建軍閥······等層層剝削和破壤所致。除開少數的特殊階級外。都壓　得喘不過氣來。這些喘不過氣的。百分之九十以上，是農民及農村出身的人。有志的青年們。應該到農村去。去領導，組織，教育成千成萬的農民們。黎個例吧。日本帝國主義占去東三省熱河。侵略平津。不是說要全國起來抵抗嗎。我們就應該到農村去宣傅組織農民去當義勇軍。慰勞抗日軍隊。！我們回農村裹去。不是厭恶城市煩囂。幻想（一個世外桃花源）。唱一唱送李愿歸盤谷（膏吾車兮秣吾馬）的調子。也不是去教幾年書。（成了一村中的領袖。可進行村治的工作）。前者是逃避現實。爲清高而到農村云。這卽是已失敗了的新村運動。後者更有閻錫山（村治的危險。說得好點去。做鄉村政權的領導。語得壤點。是造就一批新式的劣紳。尤先生的辦法。有上面兩種流弊。我們應該反對的。我們到農村裹去。是宣傅組織，教育農村羣衆參加改革社會的整個運動。又如黨國要人說。非開放政權不　救國難。我們就應該到農村去教育農民。在此應着重說明的。我們固然不應該重復三十年來那麽教育救國實業救國農村救國等爛調。應知道，救國是需要羣衆力量。没有羣衆。卽有好主義。不會實現。但是如果廣大的農村，都有了覺悟多敢保證什麽都不成問題的。話又說回來了。（奮鬥呀）。好的。但如失業的雄聲君的個人生活怎麽辦？恕我不能如尤先生做出生活計算書。那麽借一二百元穿布袍。收一隻鷄鴨或三十只鷄蛋等。我只能答復一句。爲廣大農村的生活衰　而奮鬥。羣衆的生活出路，就是個人的生活出路。再說一句。只有逃避　逃避奮鬥的人。會凍死餓死。</p>

<p>分區賽史略阮蔚村</p>
<p>已有二十年之歷史</p>
<p>正式賽此爲第七届</p>
<p>本届全國分區足球、於昨日、在武昌舉行、地點在鄂省公共體育場、會期共凡三天、此次參加比賽者、原定有華東·華西·華中·華南·華北五區·惟華南隊因時期不適·臨時中止參加、華北隊因時局關係所阻、現在已選派選手、計有華東·華西·華中三隊·查吾國足球之有分區會戰、遠始於前清宣統二年、時第一届全國運動會、舉行於南京南洋勸業塲、除田徑賽籃球網球外、各區足球、亦紛紛赴會、計加入者爲華東、華西、華南、華北、華中五隊、無形中成爲分區比賽、華南華東兩隊、得决賽資格、結果華南以一比○勝、榮膺斯届錦標第二届、全國運動會、於民國三年舉行於北京天壇、參加足球賽者、僅有東西兩部、結果東部得錦標、</p>
<p>嗣後國内因連年戰事、運動競賽停止多年、延至民國十三年、在武昌開第三届全國運動會、乃繼續舉行分區比賽、斯年參加者共四隊、爲華東區·華北區·及湖浜與文華兩大學、華南因日期關係、未及與賽、結果華東與文華得决賽　、華東以六比一得到最後勝利奪得錦標、</p>
<p>民國十四年五月、吾國爲準備參加第七届遠東、全國預賽在上海聖的翰大學舉行、同時亦有分區足球比賽、惟參加者只有華東華北兩隊、在天文台路中華足球塲舉行、採三　兩勝制、第一次華東以二比一勝、第二次華北以二比○勝、第三次華東以四比三勝、</p>
<p>自民國十三年、中華全國體育協進會成立以後、鑒於吾國足球界之散漫、鮮有會戰機會、爲謀振興聯絡之計、遂發起全國分區足球賽會、於民國十五年春、舉行於上海中華棒球塲、是爲正式分區賽之新紀元、由華南·華東兩隊首先參加、華北隊因時局關係、未能出席、華中隊臨時未到、及由東南二隊比賽、取三賽二勝制、結果華南隊以八比二、五比一連勝兩次、民國十六年、華東華南兩隊、繼續舉行第二届分區賽、華東隊　召　下、　上海埠　代表隊　時出發書準開戰　　、　　仍　華南、</p>
<p>民國十七年、第三届全　分區足球賽、復舉行　　　、華南　　中華會合任南區代表、而華北區　幾許困難、卒能糾合健兒、南下參加、於是分區賽會、漸　進步現象、三角　　、華東先以四比二　華南、而華南以九比一　華北、華東又以　比二勝華北、　標　爲華東　得、　空前未有之紀錄、民國十八年、第四届全國分區足球賽、　北區之要求、舉行於華北、惟華南隊因氣候不服、未能參加、華東華北兩隊、逐　冠軍、採三賽三勝制、分别在北平天津兩地舉行、　以促進北方民衆之注意、喚起足球界之與趣、是擾　之良策、結果華東隊以三比○及一比○連勝兩次、保持冠軍、</p>
<p>民國十九年春、第五届全國分區足球賽舉行於香港、華北隊則以路途遙遠、未克參加、華南華東兩隊、第一次　、華東先勝二球、華南造成各二、乃和局而散、再决雌雄、先以三比三和局、延長時間、各得一球、成四比四和局、於是再以作第三次决賽、觀衆逹一萬七千、爲從來未有之盛况、結果華南以四比一勝、先前兩仗、華東機會甚多、未勝於前、而敗於後、殊可惜也、</p>
<p>民國二十年四年、第六届全國分區足球賽復舉行於上海、參加者有華東、華北、華中三隊、華南隊缺席、華西隊因動身　延、未及趕上、競賽之結果、華北隊先以二比一勝華中、華東再十比○勝華中、華東華北决賽、華東以五比一勝華北、民國二十一年、因國難嚴重、故分區賽、乃推延至今年方舉行、此次比賽、實爲正式分區賽之第七届、在過去之六届比賽中、計華東隊優勝四次、華南隊優勝二次、</p>

<p>關於栅漏</p>
<h3>最完美的栅漏</h3>
<p>— 企</p>
<p>讀者大槪已經知道二極眞空管是什麽東西了吧？牠祇有燈絲和屏極而没有栅極。除用作檢波器和整流器外，尚有一種絶妙的用處，便是用作可變栅漏。</p>
<p>當二極管的燈絲未通電流時，燈絲與屏極間的空間的電阻是無限高的。如將電流通於燈絲則此空間的電阻可以改變成自無限高至數千歐的各異的程度。所以一隻二極眞空管加上一組電池和一隻變阻器，是最可靠的可變珊漏了；牠的用法可參看附圖。</p>
<h3>栅漏發生雜音的防止</h3>
<p>— 企</p>
<p>不良的栅漏，像其他不良的機件一様，也能發生雜音。原因是微細的炭素粒子互相擦動時便會發出微細的聲音。這些炭素粒子因受機械力或氣温的影響而有些微移動時，便會改變栅漏的電阻，使成音電流有所變動，同時便在聽筒或放聲器裹發出一種雜音來。所以栅漏必須用最好的質料製造，更須避免潮濕等惡影響。倘係自製鉛筆線痕的栅漏，最好在接線以後放在石蠟中浸漬一下。說起接線，最好用小銅夾夾住，因爲栅漏的障礙往往由於接線的不良而起。</p>
<h3>不費分文的栅漏</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>火柴一根，剪去黑頭，塗以黑色６Ｂ鉛筆，兩端繞以細銅絲，便成一個實用的栅電阻。</p>
<h3>多擴聲器的收音機</h3>
<p>— 襄</p>
<p>諸位可曾看見一　收音機裹有幾個擴聲器（ＬＯＮＤＳＰＥＡＫＥＲ）或稱高聲器，俗呼喇叭。）的麽？　位或者要以爲用了幾個擴聲器，可以使發出來的聲音大一些。不是的，現在我把他的作用，說明一下。</p>
<p>每個擴聲器發出的聲音，他的成音　率的範　，都有一定的限制；普通單隻擴聲器的收音機，很少能使４０００週率以上的聲音有滿意的成績；我們在收音機裹遇着遇高的聲音，時常發　，就是這個緣故；爲謀補救這種弊病起見，就有多數擴聲器的收音機發明；把各種週率不同的擴聲器合併在一個收音機裹。分任發出各種不同週率的聲音；這種裝置可使高至１２０００週率的聲音，很自然地發出；合併的方法，有下面兩種：第一種方法，以兩個或三個週率範圍不同的擴聲器，照圖一合併之；每個擴聲器的前面，連有不同的選界濾波器，這濾波器僅能使適合某個擴聲器週率範圍以内的電流通過，其餘不適合的，完全革除，這様可使在一個擴聲器裹發出來的聲音，不能在其他的擴聲器裹發出。</p>
<p>第二種方法所用的擴聲器，和第一種同，但不以濾波器直接連至各個擴聲器，而以輸出放大級代之（圖二），這種放大級因爲有配諧的輸入和輸出變壓器等也祇能供給適合於某個擴聲器的電流，而在放大級輸入前，仍各連一選界濾波器，這様可使週率不合的電壓，不能逹到各個放大級的輸入線路，各個擴聲器，就能發揚他特殊的效能了。</p>
<h3>天綫之種種（續）</h3>
<p>— 金雲樵</p>
<p>天線與環境氣候，均有密切關係，四周多建築物，尤其有高大鋼骨凝和土房屋等之處，所裝天線收音距離較平曠之地爲减，因一部份電浪，已被建築物吸收，東西向較南北向近，係地球磁性關係，夏季較冬令近，日中較晚上近，蓋一部份之電波，每爲陽光所攫奪也。</p>
<p>天線如裝於屋頂之上，則與屋面須有五呎以上之距離，引入線尤不宜躺入瓦楞中，致多腐損包皮漏電之弊。更不可與地線引入線相絞，致天線電流，因感應而宜洩於地，如不得已而與地線並行裝置時，則兩線宜相隔二三時。</p>
<p>地線據實騐所得，可裝無限收音機，天線則反是，須各分裝，藉免影響收音效率。</p>
<p>天線短，電容量小，選擇性佳，收本埠好，外埠次之。天線長，電容量大，收外埠好，本埠則選擇性較遜。若天線太長，不易改短時，可串接一五片或七片之小號可變電容器，以團節之，選擇性可增加，惟音量較遜。</p>
<p>天線過短，不易收波長較長之電台，故短波機可用短天線，長波機必用長天線。天地線引入線之總長度，勿過五十公尺，如地線太長，可將天線引入線酌量收短，以平均其誘導率。鋼骨凝和土之房屋内，不適於裝用屋内天線。屋外天線及地線間，應裝避雷器，或用閘刀，以司啓閉，免致雷雨時，劇烈之天電傅入室内，而遭意外危險。接線如第六圖。（完）</p>

<p>建華電機公司編輯部招請各埠經售處編輯部，出版各種無線電書藉，除無線電交流收音機概要及無綫電新公約，無綫電學詳解，已經出版外，其餘如短波發報機，蓄電池，乾電池及充電器無線電字典等，均在陸續出版中。惟對於外埠來函訂購者，極感不便，開該公司擬在外埠招請經售處以便利外埠購買云。</p>
<p>霪雨連綿中之無線電界數日前春遊節假，霪雨連朝，各界人士欲挾侶游山玩水者多遭雨阻，苦悶之狀，不堪言喻，但此時凡家中置有收音機者則大可消磨時光於收音機旁，而無復感覺苦悶。惟應特加注意者，霪雨連朝中，收音機每易損壤，不得不求一完善之修理公司。本埠仁記路二十五號，亞逹公司，專營無線電收音機事業，於去歲特設修理部，收到各界委托修理之收音機，踵趾相接，雖忙碌異常而交件迅速，並出立保單，保證使用。當此困人天氣中，各界之備有收音機者，應大加注意也。</p>
<h3>一年來馬可尼公司之成績（續）</h3>
<p>— 丹</p>
<p>四、空中無綫電的增加從康柏拉（ＫＡＮＡＰＡＬＥ）烏甘德（ＵＧＡＮＤＡ）經過英屬非洲（ＢＲＩＴＩＣＨＡＦＲＩＣＡ）到開浦（ＣＡＰＯＴＯＷＮ）　的馬可尼公司中波與短波電台的連絡，已經完成了。這電台是專爲從陸地至空中，與從空中至陸地的通訊，供給帝國航空公司　羅與開浦間的航空路線，以及許多地方上的通訊之用。</p>
<p>飛機中無線電的設備，去年曾經有過特别的研究，但是在　條航空的線上，有一種極端困難的情形，就是常要遇到極　烈的電浪的衝撃。在去年中，馬可尼公司的許多工程師，化費了六個月的時間，在這條路線上飛乘各種不同的飛機，從事研究。直接考察研究的結果，已經創造了一種中波，短波都可應用的，新的航空無線電機。此種電機在飛行中任何時候都可不絶的通訊，而短波長更不致於受天氣變化的影響。</p>
<p>去年五月二十日，曾經舉行了一次現代空中至陸地，與陸地至空中電話，應用的表演。倫敦東北鐵道公司（ＬＯＮＤＯＮＡＮＤＮＯＲＴＨＲＡＩＬＷＡＹＣＯＭＰＡＮＹ）的倫敦愛丁　　很有名的蘇格蘭號特别快車中，裝置了馬可尼空中無線電機，在車中可與帝國航空公司的飛機中人互相談話，而二者都以高速率在進行。</p>
<p>再者，輕便飛機中，無綫電的應用，也是很　著的增加了。許多有名的飛機師，都已具備馬可尼的空中無線電機了</p>
<p>爲了獎進英國民衆航空學術的發展，英國的航空部從馬可尼公司，定購了一部很完全的無線電發音機，建立於孟却斯透飛機公司，這是大不列顛，在城市的飛機塲中所建立的第一個完全的無線電臺。（未完）</p>

<h3>莫斯科附近成立全世界最大之廣播電臺</h3>
<p>離莫斯科六十米突之諾定斯克地方，新建一全世界最大之廣播無線電臺，工程已完竣。此電臺波長爲一千四百八十一米突，電力逹五百啓羅瓦特，其空中綫長九百米突架，此線之四金屬柱高二百米突，此廣播臺僱用工程師五人，管理機件。莫斯科無線電研究室與此廣播臺間有一電報線聯絡。此廣播臺之建造悉用俄國自製材料，建造費逹七百五十萬盧布。其中用於設備項下之經費逹三百二十五萬盧布云。（塔斯社）</p>
<p>蘭琴堡之音波，能及於新西蘭在良好的環境之下，中波長的廣播，也可逹到極遠的地方。蘭琴堡（ＬＡＮＥＡＢＥＲＧ）的廣播電台，曾得到一封從新西蘭（ＮＯＷＸＥＡＬＡＮＤ）寄來的信，信中說，他常接收蘭琴堡的節目音樂常是很清楚，說話則有時稍覺模糊云。（飛利浦社）</p>
<h3>賴維奇之擴大計劃</h3>
<p>奥地利廣播公司，最近發表一種計劃。預備要大大的變更技術，與改良廣播，他的計劃中。要把現在所用的全部機器換去，易以新式的　音機。更把現在電台間的通訊工作改良。採用超短波（ＵＬＲＡＳＨＯＲＴＷＡＶＥ）。尚有一重要的部分，就是要想建立一廣播宮殿（ＢＲＯＡＤＣＡＳＴＩＮＧＰＡＬＡＣＥ），約需費六百萬奥地利先令，至改變機件與改進廣播之費用，估計約需一千四百萬先令，這計劃預備於兩年中完成。（飛利浦社）</p>

<h3>兵血樓瞻盧</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>湯玉麟復任軍長聲中，引起了熱河省旅津同鄉的反響，　陳湯氏父子四大罪狀於查辦專使方邵二公；一　洋洋千餘言的血涙文章，讀之令人浩歎。可惜，這篇文字在湯氏失敗以後發表；假使，在熱河無恙時代，已有人把湯氏的劣迹和盤托出，使他不安於位，而熱河得到一位賢明忠勇的主席，那麽時局或者不會糟到這般地步。</p>
<p>臚列的四大罪狀：（一）洩漏軍情，背叛中央；（二）濫發紙幣，尅扣軍餉；（三）任用私人，橫征暴暴斂；（四）昏庸淫暴，濫押無辜。四大罪狀中，第三條所列的事實，尤其使人不平，什麽木匠某某，膺軍務處處長；大連龜奴某某，膺軍政參謀；駐平泉時，敲詐烟土，姦淫良家婦女；在遼寗，日本站，南市塲，三經路，二馬路，安東縣，各處蓋有大厦，一例經樓；官商等以其暴斂扣餉，積資築成，都稱紅樓爲兵血樓。但是，到了現在，這幾處兵血樓，都插着如血的旭日旗了。</p>
<p>（玉杯飲盡千家血，銀燭燒殘百姓齊）；這是貪官汚吏的一副對聯。可惜，老湯的兵血樓已被敵人佔去了；要是不然，也可以掛上一副對聯，呌做：雕闌抺盡千軍血，　楝揩乾百姓膏。</p>
<h3>支那阿四庸子</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>上海有許多没有國籍，整天過着流浪生活的白俄，呌做（羅宋阿大。）還有許多亡了國，做大英帝國的奴隷，而内心裹藴蓄着革命情緒的紅頭黑炭，呌做（印度阿三）。這些佳名，都是咱聰明不過的中國人所發明，而得到上海雜處着的（五方）所共同承認的。</p>
<p>日軍侵滬的時候，皇軍浩浩蕩蕩的殺奔上海來，滿想一鼓而下淞滬，不用三鼓而到紫金山下，使中國俯首貼耳，自願（年年納貢，歲歲來朝）的做一個高麗第二。在那時候，上海有許多（支那通）的日本人，投我所好，錫以嘉名，曰（支那阿四）。啊，怎麽當得起！所謂怎麽當得起者，咱也有一番大道理。（羅宋阿大），大半都是貴族出身，從前是吃慣用慣的，咱中國一般牛馬般的平民，怎敢同他們稱兄道弟。印度阿三是祖國立脚不住，於是飄流到異域來。咱中國（地大物博），閘北開砲，儘可在租界裹逍遙作樂，怎敢同耐勞刻苦，死要革命的（印度阿三）通蘭譜。</p>
<p>不過照目前這様的（五日一城，七日一市）的（佈置新陣線），退出□□□情勢下看來，皇軍不難到平津喫　子，到鄭州濟南喫月餅，到紫金山下喫年夜飯。倘給咱妖言不幸而中，那麽，却之不恭，咱們惟有在太陽旗下，謝我皇萬歲，禦賜佳名，不敢不受。</p>
<p>但，四萬萬（支那阿四）之中，還得要有些涇渭，不可一視同仁，例如帶了數十箱金珠細軟，到瑞士别墅去打高而夫球的（張平民）之輩，至少應當敕封爲（支那阿二）。至爲我們這些膿包阿斗，得爲（支那阿四），已是（皇恩浩蕩），抬舉到一百二十分。</p>

<p>毘陵沈某，將於下旬入贅吳中祝氏，爲祝枝山後人，日昨與知友數人，聚飲於某酒家；庖人獻筍。座有某甲，性素詼諧卽口占一聯曰：（笱，遇旬卽成竹。）蓋某甲以諧聲格以調沈也。沈明知之，思有以報之。移時，　應曰：（你，忽爾不像人。）於是閻座大笑，都有噴飯者。若沈某者，眞不愧爲老蛇（祝枝山）後人矣。</p>
<h3>雨中</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>人家說：（天道反常。）這句話，我以前很不相信。人家又說：（世風日下），這句話，我却一百二十分地相信，你如過以爲是錯的，可以打開我們的歷史，一代一代的嬗過下來的看，一定可以把我的話來證明。然而天道反常，）現在也把它證明是眞了。照着每年的節候說，在這個春末夏初的時候，寒暑表最低也得在五○度以上，中午的時候當在六○度以上。但是（天道反常）的今年，大大的不然，在這幾天的早上，還不到四○度呢？有一般年老的人們，老羊皮袍子，還背在身上！就是一般不怕冷的摩登姑娘，伊們的絲絨大衣或皮領大衣，還不捨得脫下來呢！這可見（春寒料峭），雖然已到行將消逝的時候，依然存在它的權威！</p>
<p>有幾位朋友，他們的星期日是有例假，他們常常這様說：（今年眞晦氣，每逢星期，老天總是下雨，這大槪是老天和我們作對吧！）誠然的，今年的春雨，似乎比往年來得多，這個下雨問題，非但一般星期休息的朋友要護駡，尤是有關係的，還是一般大公司以及大商家，因爲他們每一個星期日，在營業方面，可以增進超過平日的收入，所以他們的咒詛，總是眞個的。</p>
<p>說到（雨）這一個字，倒很含着一些詩意，你翻開前人的詩集，不是有（雨窗紀事）（蕉軒聽雨）（雨中友）等佳作麽？我本是個俗子，不能領略個中的滋味：但在這次到松江，却又逢天雨，午夜回逆旅，小樓一角，雨聲淅瀝，倒引我想起前人的兩句詩了：（小樓一夜聽春雨，深巷明朝賣杏花。）多麽情緻纒綿？上海雖然是科學化，在雨中的柏油路</p>
<p>上，倒也有種異趣。你可（臨高下矚）那摩托卡開足了速率的疾行，橡皮輪在那微有積水的柏油路窪處，嗤嗤衝激的時候，也就是最有意味的時候，假如你到路上去，那要留心你的尊服給他濺汚了</p>
<h3>皮箱的其他神秘</h3>
<p>— 張寗一</p>
<p>確然皮箱現在是最時髦不過的了，在本春秋上錫昌君已舉二個神秘的例，他還說其他的神秘要請有皮包的自已來說，我正是皮箱同志之一，就不妨來說說吧！</p>
<p>不過話先說明，我用皮箱並非學時髦，旣不有西裝褲，所謂長袍也者，也祇布衣一領，若要說我皮箱的神秘，正是從何說起？但是别人的皮箱却被我窺到了不少神秘！</p>
<p>少數同學爲着要充運動家，於是買上皮箱一隻，這様穿上燈籠褲，足套籃球鞋，最妙不過的肩上掛一雙球鞋，儼然就是個運動家，在女學生前走過也就有點威武氣槪，這裹一隻皮箱就神秘極了至於一般女學生呢，雖然不是全體，可是多數皮箱裹粉，和點唇膏總少不了！在冷天呢，絨線和竹針也是必有之品還有社會小說和愛情小說也會在皮箱裹出現，影戲說明書倒也不少！</p>
<p>有一天我發現一隻皮箱神秘極了，是在宿舍裹，阿王的一隻小皮箱，你道裹面放的什麽，不是書，却是紡綢褲帶一條巴黎檀香粉二盒，手表一隻，旁氏白玉霜二瓶，花手帕一打，原來他新近結婚，這東西預備那天（星期六）回鄉時給他ＷＩＦＥ做禮物！</p>

<h3>上海夜話</h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>咖啡館詩人</p>
<p>在初春濛雨的黃昏，從環龍路紅烏書店買了一册比愛魯易ＢＩＥＥＲＲＥＬＯＵＹＳ的（私</p>
<p>人日記）穿過那條幽靜的情侶狹徑，在霞飛路人行道上，冒雨朝西走去。</p>
<p>走過亞爾培路才二三百步，我推進一家玻璃窗上繪着一行五線譜的小咖啡館，樂譜上圈了臘掃覽獨　ＬＡＳＯＬＲＥＤＯＲＥ五個音符，這個商標設計得多麽别緻啊！因爲這家咖啡館的法文招牌是ＬＡＳＯＬＥＤＯＲＥ，譯義是（金魚），譯音恰和音符中的（獨覽梅花掃臘雪），有二個字是諧音的。</p>
<p>小方桌上，供着兩三枝幽香的水仙，一杯盛滿濃郁的土耳其黑咖啡噴出繚繞的雲霧，我一個人默坐在珠露紗的窗帘下望着橙黃色的屋頂，和金剛鑽石般的電燈，幻想着天方夜譚中第一千零二夜的怪誕故事。</p>
<p>半小時的光陰，跟着我腦中的幻像和桌上的咖啡都消逝了。翻開（私人日記），揭到三○七頁，咖啡館詩人魏爾倫ＶＥＲＬＡＩＮＥ的名字赫然呈在我眼前：</p>
<p>這一晚，我帶了素紙想到圖書館去抄詩。在路上撞見一個灰色長髮和灰色軟帽的人，疏稀的長鬚，黃的眼睛，走路的時候，靠着一根手杖，露出步伐困難的様子。</p>
<p>（魏爾倫先生嗎？）（是的，先生。）（我喜歡得很，從前和你曾見過一次，你記得嗎？）（對不起，對不起，我，我······啊！你眞是可愛得很，是吓，是可愛。但是······但是你願意跟我一起走嗎，我們可以多談一會！······）於是我們走進了一家咖啡館。我告訴他，我所愛讀的他的作品。那個可憐的詩人，含了眼涙聽着。他抖顫着聲音對我說（幸福）是一本（無情）的書。一本（無情）的書。我在裹面說過，惟一的幸福是這様：知道天主是實有的。只等有人知道了這個，一切生活上的不幸，無論是怎様厲害的，都會化爲烏有。</p>
<p>（你現在住在那裹？）（我没有住處，我投宿在黑夜中。）付完了帳，魏爾倫打開他的一隻錢袋，裹面只存着一個法郎和十個生司，他道謝了一聲，把侍者找出來二十個銅元也收過去了。（這便是我所有的資産，明天呢，我不知道將怎様。先生，貧窮是聖潔的，眞正是聖潔的。在一小時前，在一家咖啡館中，一個侍者，先生，一個侍者不肯招待我，因爲我穿得太不像様了；他說我要妨礙别的客人。）讀到這裹，我便放下了（私人日記）。想到這個法國象徵派民間詩人，在暮年時度着貧窮狼狽生涯，又聽着窗外雨點的聲音，不禁背誦出魏爾倫的一首（秋歌）來了：心裹落着眼涙，像都會中落着雨，那侵入我心坎的，是怎様的寥寂愁緒？ＩＬＰＬＥＵＴＥＤＡＮＳＭＯＮＣＯＥＵＲＣＯＭＭＥＩＬＤＬＥＵＴＳＵＲＬＡＶＩＬＬＥＱＵＥＬＬＥＣＥＴＴＥＬＡＮＧＵＥＵＲＯＵＩＰＥＮＥＴＲＥＤＡＮＳＭＯＮＣＯＥＬＩＲ</p>

<h3>紗花廠商買進標紗</h3>
<p>紗市晨疲午堅、但實需依然沉悶、各帮仍無生氣、以各方經濟枯涸、商業殊難發展、但有一部份廠商以明日起實行減工、在期貨市塲大量的購進、於是市面稍稍回高、然世界潮流惡化、國内農村破産、民窮財盡、現紗銷化缺乏、兼之劣紗賤價傾銷、本紗何能獨漲、</p>

<h3>標花時作小進退</h3>
<p>棉市始跌後回、趨勢仍疲、因世界棉業情形仍屬不利、且銀價大長、金市狂落、而美棉漲數甚微、採算銀盤價較昨日每擔廉九角至一元、紗廠明日起實行減工、需要愈少、惟大户多頭拉緊、仍不放出、市况尚昂、不過現棉消費頗滯云、</p>

<p>昨日紐約絲市僅漲二分、計價一元四角七分、橫濱微跌爲八百元、大槪物價上漲、應隨人民之購買力爲歸宿、不能過分迅速、故昨日漲風之停頓、爲自然之趨勢也、本市雖有交易、惟不甚多、計白廠經紅卐字牌廿·廿二·八二匀度、售去五十擔、價七百二十五元、連納進二十擔、通運進二十擔、怡和進十擔、山東黃廠經又售去三十擔、爲連納所購、價六百六十元、怡和又進進行廿·廿二·八三　度十擔、價七百二十元、又進普通貨廿廿二八○匀度二十擔、價七百元、又進黃廠經廿·廿二·十五擔、價六百九十五元、運昌進ＷＴＫ牌十三·十五·十擔、價八百十元、　藍樂璧亦有廿·廿二·交易價七百元、惟擔數不能證實、據商品檢騐局報告、上星期生絲出口計一百六十三擔連廠絲二十擔、共計一百八十三擔云、附英法華絲價格如左（廿日）市塲等級價格合國幣倫敦華絲Ａ字七先令六便士七一六華絲Ｂ字七先令六六五里昂華絲Ａ字八十七法郎半八○○華絲Ｂ字八十二法郎半七五○</p>
<h3>糧食麫粉曾一度向榮</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈平穩盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、又漲三四六七角不等、銀價放長、洋麥之報漲、彷彿爲意中事、惟金市飄搖、昨日開價又落五六十元、此種嚴重之局勢、亦予業中人深刻之印象、故開價時、曾因洋麥之漲、市面似有興旺上騰之勢、惟大小各廠趁人心之激昂、亦暗中暢抛不已、所以結果、祇近期微好、遠期反較前日跌半分、迨至下午開盤、熱閙之市氣、已告一段落、因外行購買、已不見湧、廠抛亦見停手、近遠各期又轉平平、觀後步之升沉、必以現洋麥之兜售如何、再定研究、就大勢而言、深恐傾銷將更緊一步也、結果本月份較前日好五釐、五月份好七釐半、六月份好二釐半、七月份不動、八九月份跌五釐云、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>言論自由的界限</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>看（紅樓夢），覺得賈府上是言論頗不自由的地方。焦大以奴才的身分，仗着酒醉，從主子駡起，直到别的一切奴才，說只有兩個石獅子乾凈。結果怎様呢？結果是主子深惡，奴才痛嫉，給他塞了一嘴馬糞。</p>
<p>其實是，焦太的駡，並非要打倒賈府，倒是要賈府好，不過說主奴如此，賈府就要弄不下去罷了。然而得到的報酬是馬糞。所以這焦在，實在是賈府的屈原，假使他能做文章，我想，恐怕也會有一篇（離騷）之類。</p>
<p>三年前的新月社諸君子，不幸和焦大有了相類的境過。他們引經據典，對於黨國有了一點微詞，雖然引的大抵是英國經典，但何嘗有絲毫不利於黨國的惡意，不過說：（老爺，人家的衣服多麽乾凈，您老人家的可有些兒髒，應該洗牠一洗）罷了。不料（荃不察余之中情兮），來了一嘴的馬糞：國報同聲致討。連（新月）雜誌也遭殃。但新月社究竟是文人學士的團體，這時就也來了一大堆引據三民主義，辨明心迹的（離騷經）現在好了，吐出馬糞，換塞甜頭，有的顧問，有的教授，有的秘書，有的大學院長，言論自由，（新月）也滿是所謂（爲文藝的文藝）了。</p>
<p>這就是文人學士究竟比不識字的奴才聰明，黨國究竟比賈府高明，現在究竟比乾隆時候光明：三明主義。</p>
<p>然而竟還有人在嚷着要求言論自由。世界上没有這許多甜頭，我想，該是明白的罷，這誤解，大約是在没有悟到現在的言論自由，只以能夠表示主人的寛宏大度的說些（老爺，你的衣服···）爲限，而還想說開去。</p>
<p>這是斷乎不行的。前一種，是和（新月）受難時代不同，現在好像已有的了，這（自由談）也就是一個證據，雖然有時還有幾位拿着馬糞，前來探頭探腦的英雄。至於想說開去，那就足以破壤言論自由的保障。要知道現在雖比先前光明，但也比先前利害，一說開去，是連性命都要送掉的。即使有了言論自由的明令，也千萬大意不得。這我是親眼見過好幾回的，非（賣老）也，不自覺其做奴才之君子，幸想一想而垂鑒焉。</p>
<h3>運命論者</h3>
<p>— 伯符</p>
<p>暴日入寇在我們各方面，捲起了種種反應，其中最有興味，而又最不爲人注意的，便是推背圖，燒餅歌，一類東西的出現。在上海居住的人，總還記得一二八時，滿街貼起燒餅歌，賣劉伯温的預言等現象，又還記得最近在各報上大登這類書的廣告吧。上海如此，别的地方，更可類推。</p>
<p>（這都是不値一顧的迷信！）我們似乎聽見有人這麽說。不錯的。可是我們理論上的否定，果能消滅這個現象麽？人生不單只是理智，我們不要忘記感情和意志形成了我們大部分的生活。也不要忘記這種迷信，是我們中國大衆生活的根底。</p>
<p>舉眼一看，我們社會生活裹，最使人注意的現象是什麽呢？生活難嗎？隨便問一個老百姓，他告訴你的話，十有八九是：（我們的命太苦了）。可知在他們的心裹，有的並不是生活的問題，而是命運的問題。在他們看來，他們只要命運好的話，一様也可以呼奴使婢，坐汽車，吃大菜，一様也是偉人名士。他們並不承認這些人和他們老底子有什麽區别！無寗還以爲這些人比他們更壤，同時，事實也不就是這様嗎？公子哥兒們，只因父祖有錢，他們便不管是天才也好，低能也好，一様的就可以穿洋服，跳舞，追逐女人，像那班無聊文人一様塡打打麻將（國家事管他娘）一類最粗俗下流的（解放詞）。可是當他們坐在黃包車上時也曾想到他自已附了頭腦裹記得幾個不生不熟的新名詞而外，還有什麽可以和那在脚下拉車的人相比呢？這不過只舉一端作例，在現在我們的生活上，可以說到處都滿佈着這種生活的不平。我們學的知識，只是在講壇上，文章　去騙人，狠少增進我們的生活，狠少能變更我們的意志感情。我們在理知方面，似乎是二十世紀的人了，可是我們動感情的時候能說比老百姓們還高嗎？然而彼此的物質生活，却又這麽的互相懸絶！</p>
<p>人終是思考的動物，就是原始頭腦的人，也由不得他不注意到人生的矛盾，由不得他不找一個解答。屬于哲學者的這種問題，在他們若不找出一個解答，也會一天也過不去。於是他們的答案，便是命運）。命好與命苦便解决了一切疑難；消滅了一切矛盾。隨着這運命觀而起的便是種種來世現世的因果，種種福善禍淫的報應燒餅歌，推背圖之說，也不過是把個人的運命論，擴大到一國去吧了。</p>
<p>這些迷信便是中國一般人的生活根底，便是他們的人生哲學。生活一大不起變更，他們這根底，便一天不會搖動。你若單從理智方面去對他說，（這是迷信，你切不可相信）時，這就如從理論方面，去對好商們說（你要愛國不可販賣劣貨）一様，不過只證明一個不可否認的事實，即是理知的無能而已。</p>
<h3>墓前</h3>
<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>大兒四歲生日後的一星期，是妻死的四週年忌辰。妻是病産褥熱症死的。臨死時，她以可憐的眼光睨着我，對着自已的胸脯做做手勢，很慘地斷了氣。我明白她的意思。</p>
<p>留下來的孩子雖很聰明，可是，至今還不知道他的親媽並不是目前這個年輕的少婦　我一瞧見孩子咬住小指孤寂地倚着牆壁睜大眼睛出神時，就禁不住憶起他那死去的母親了。孩子的靈活的眸子，和那躭於夢想的神情，都絶似死去的妻。我常常覺得有許多地方對不起那死去的母親，和她所留下給我的小生命。雖然現在的妻對我這孩子，和對她自己那個二歲的孩子没有兩様，可是，我一看到大兒子那様酷肖他的生母的神情時，心裹總覺得有點兒慘</p>
<p>也許不純是心理作用，我常感到自己因爲後妻在面前的緣故，給了第二個孩子更多的愛寵，當我發覺這個時，似乎聽見前妻在另一世界裹的歎息。於是我愧悔地把糼兒推開而把大兒抱在懹裹。</p>
<p>但小孩子是渴望父母親的寵愛的，被推開的糼兒仍像皮球似的在我身邊滾來滾去要我抱。於是妻說：</p>
<p>（大寳！讓讓你的小弟弟罷，你比他大些。）</p>
<p>大兒搂住我的頸子發出不情願的撒嬌聲。</p>
<p>我把眸子停在大兒的兩眼裹，陡的，我氣憤地叱開在膝前纒繞的糼兒：（什麽小些大些！你到處都　自已的孩子憤然地對妻說）。妻對於我這　然而來的氣憤，有點茫然，慢慢地，她埀下頭流涙！於是我又覺得對於後妻有點歉然！在地下的妻已經死去四年了。妻是清明日死的，窗外她親手栽的桃花已經盛放了，我想起了安眠在萬國公墓的妻，便領着一家子去掃墓。</p>
<p>清晨的萬國墓，差不多一個人都没有。我們把一對花圈悄悄地倚放在妻的墓碑下：（大寳！走過來和爸爸一様鞠個躬。）孩子張大了眼。（來學爸爸的様乖乖地鞠個躬）（爸爸這是什麽東西呢？）這是···乖孩子鞠躬吧，這是墳···）孩子的　活的大眼睛，又使我想起了埋在墓中的妻生前的種種好處，我嘆息着。</p>
<p>後妻也放下手上的孩子，向墳墓鞠了個躬，她對着花圈沉思了一會，憂傷地搖搖頭，她的眼睛忽然潤濕了，（我覺得人生眞太可怕了！）她的聲音很慘。（怎麽？）</p>
<p>（也許三四年後我要給你和另外的一個女人　悼呢···）我强笑着：（你可以相信我，我對兩個孩子都會一様痛愛的！也許我會比你先！）</p>
<p>（不許你說！）妻連忙掩了我的嘴。（世事茫茫難自料），誰又知道三四年以後的事情呢？</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他愈覺得全身發冷了，但不能不戰抖着走下樓去。他剛把後門打開，看見那個廖副牧師正立在他的面前。海泉更加驚異了。</p>
<p>（啊，林先生！）廖牧師看鑡海泉，也表示着驚異。（廖先生，有什麽事？）（啊，老曹身體不好。最初只當他是稍微的感冒。但是到後來，才知道他發熱發得厲害。所以哈牧師呌我送他回來。要他多休息幾天。不必到教會去。······（老曹此刻在那裹？）（在汽車裹。汽車駛不進來，停在弄堂口。）過了二十多分鐘，他們三個人才把病人抬上床，呌他睡下去了。世光的體温雖然很高，但精神還清爽。他睡着說了许多對不起海泉的話。世光愈這様說，海泉愈不忍離開他們。他不能不帮帮秋英的忙，料理家裹的瑣事了。並且秋英常常，或向他溜溜奇妙的眼色，或揑揑他的手腕。當他們走到房門首共同燒飯菜時，她有時還要伸過嘴來要求他的接吻。（不得了！自已不知不覺掉進陷穽裹面了！她眞個從高空上面向自已的頭上蹴了一脚後，便不住地蹴着自已的頭頂跳舞了。）秋英還有更露骨的表示。有時，她悼嘆她的命苦，嫁錯了人，同時就表示她是如何的愛他。有時，她又怨歎她勞働多而營養少，所以瘦成這個様子，同時便袒露出胸脯和雪白的腿部來給海泉看。</p>
<p>海泉就這様地受着秋英的籠絡，一連勞苦了三四天。他差不多要變爲他倆的（　下婢）了。（自已太没有志氣了。我是中華好男兒！我是有爲的革命的青年！有一次，他向她說，想出去走一趟，等明天再回來看他們。（林先生，太不近人情了吧。看見我這様的狼狽，要服伺病人，又要看小孩子，你也忍心走麽？）她說了後便表示出滿臉不高與的神色。海泉給他這様地一說，怔住了，一時不會說話，也不會動了。（········要人家替你開心的時候，就，·······）海泉還没有聽完她的話，就驚惶起來了。他想，她眞是厲害。但是自已想辯也無從辯了。她已經揑住了自已的弱點。（好的，我不走就是了。）他唯有苦笑着回答她了。（這才乖呢！·······）她又送了一陣奇妙的眼色來。（······林先生，我眞歡喜你啊。你就離開我一刻的工夫，我也不知要怎様的寂寞，怎様的難過啊！）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>血，涙，力！</h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>心，我精神所寄託的心啊！　　你還記得嗎？在凄風苦雨的一個下午，火車汽笛鳴鳴悲鳴聲中，我誑了媽遛出來上車站和你送别，要不是那天車站上有那許多人，我眞要抱着你浴涙痛哭一塲，然而終於在風雨中流着眼涙眼睜睜地望着你的影子糢糊而至於消逝！心啊，因爲這次的别離，我很知道是異乎尋常的呀！怎呌我那時不肝腸碎裂而永遠不能彌補呢？</p>
<p>但，你應該也相當的給我媽一些諒解，媽固是只知勢利的人，然而她是没有智識的可憐的愚者呀！這，你究竟還不明白嗎？我平時屢次請求你（努力於你的事業，將來我們準會挽回媽的心意的），雖說這些話當時確使你發生了極大的反感而咒詛着現實，甚至於痛駡全人類然而在你每次盛氣過後的一刹那。你不是老是說（是的，我需要振作）嗎？爲甚麽你又不貫徹你的諾言而竟要出之於走呢？走固然是無辦法中一個最乾脆爽利的辦法，但，心啊你會知道在故鄉終日爲你飲涙，悲哀，凄苦的孤獨人嗎？·····媽仍是保持着原有的嚴厲而又慈仁，我想，我的這顆冰冷了的心，還會重復温暖嗎？······</p>
<p>昨晚，正在極度空虚，悵惘，獨自悲苦的當兒，郵差給我帶來失去了半年的心！我是怎様的歡躍發狂呵！我用顫抖着的手展開這珍奇的寳貝，長吻了好多次，然後高擎着以最尖銳的眸子一個字，一個字細細地慢慢地咀嚼着，我生怕一口氣讀完之後，空虚和悲哀會再來襲撃我的心頭，而且這確是我用了五十多次血和涙書成的東西交換來的罕有的珍奇的寳貝呀！我能不萬分珍貴着嗎？可是，我的心啊！你這還是初次帶給我的禮物就未免太殘酷了一些而呌我更其慘痛心裂啊。因爲你說你（今後應當從救國家救人類而出發獲取我們的幸福和自由你又說（因爲捨了拿血肉去爭奪以外，簡直没有他途你眞如此實行嗎？這太給我責任重大了！我是這様一個平康的女子，也値得你拚命去爭取？這不更增大我的罪孽嗎？</p>
<p>爲了這事，我痛哭了一整夜：可是最後我却被你感動而完全覺悟了：我明白了以前你的所謂（振作）：又誠如你說，（在帝國主義者層層壓迫之下，國家已經喪失了自由，甚至步上了亡國的路程，我們要這痛苦而不徹底的幸福幹甚麽？）是啊！我們正應當燃熾着我們的生命的火把，照耀着我們的有行動的革命羣衆向帝國主義者及一切黑暗勢力爭奪我們國家民族的眞正的幸福和自由！我們應當在這黑暗罪惡的圈裹，高高的掛起我們的明燈來心啊，我現在是你忠實的同志，也是你的眞摯的信徒，我已决定抛棄了一切來幹我們自已的事，也就是全人類的事。心啊，你看吧。</p>

<h3>哀秦皇島</h3>
<p>— 錢夢苕</p>
<p>北椅榆關南秦島，天險由來鬼工造，一朝關陷島獨存，鵬吻摩雲圖一飽，黑雲朝壓城南門。軍未見賊先逃奔，豈知賊來僅五十，而况五十皆遊魂，將軍乃爲萬全計，詎肯孤軍輕一試，從此濼東無漢旌，析津日晚烟塵驚，鳴呼誰掌北門鑰，聚鐵三邊成此錯，</p>
<h3>商人</h3>
<p>— 潤溪</p>
<p>我們知道，（商人）是做生意的人的稱呼，只要有了交易的舉動的人，就呌他呌做（商人）了，不道我今天所指的，是指（販賣智識的商人）。</p>
<p>中國的學校，也不可說十二分的少，單就上海一塊地方，就有很多很多了；當中有公立的和私立的，確實的數目，我也没有相當的調查，總之，（販賣智識的商人），這個名詞，因此跑出來了。今舉例以如之：</p>
<p>上海有個ＸＸ私立中學，我有一個同鄉在裹面讀書，每學期的用費，至少要三百餘元，至於正當的，繳給學校的，確有一百九十幾元，其餘的都是他自用去了；而每天只有三四課，隨便學生去不去的，滿了三年，給一張文憑罷了；ＸＸ中學也是男女同校的共有一百幾十個同學，在ＸＸ路ＸＸ衖同的三層樓上，租了兩間亭子間，做教室等等用常，這様看來，當然是没有寄宿的，都是通學的了，每天的來來往往，多麽的好看啊！紅紅綠綠的衣衫，一年四季，有四季的大衣，另外有一個小皮箱，平常在電車上都是雙雙對對的，談着密絲Ａ或Ｂ，同時亦同様回答密絲脫Ｃ或Ｄ，什麽戀愛，也同様發生了。</p>
<p>唉！中國的教育，大家都曉得是破産了，的確，是破産了，照上面實在情形看來，當然是破産了；三年過後，一班一班的畢業了，社會上也不能容納這類的人來替社會務服，爲社會勤勞，於是也照様的辦一個ＸＸ學校，也同様的造就青年，可憐的青年，在青年時代，都是苟安的，馬虎的（好學生例外），也就進了這種學校；循環的一年一年幹下去，要埋没多少青年呀！凡是辦那種學校，上海而言，都帶有營業性質的，想賺兩個金錢，生活生活；所謂的（販賣智識的商人），名符其實了。</p>
<h3>大衆生活</h3>
<p>— 翁土申</p>
<p>一起身，頭腦兒就覺得有些發暈，想是今天不去拉她媽的了，但是又想起了一天不拉，肚子就要發生恐慌，還要受我那黃臉老婆的辱駡，不得不硬着頭皮，拖了沉重的脚步，拉着六十餘斤的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>車子，向着平滑而遼闊的馬路上走去，拐了一個灣，也算是我的幸運，就聽見有人在喊着（黃包車），我就用力的拉了車子前去，一看到那個主顧，就使我吃了一驚，願來是一個四十多歲的大胖子，他一人的體重，約有二百磅哩，還帶着二件重笨的行旅，使人望而生畏，但是爲着生活的鞭策，不能顧着這一切的了，那時我就開口問先生到什麽地方去，（北火車站，二角小洋），那大胖子神氣活現的答着，我說先生你有這許多的東西，三角錢吧，（不要，二角小洋你去末去不去拉倒（，那大胖子像怒似的說，那時我爲着要飽肚皮，不得不遷就一些，急急的說去，說去，那胖子主顧，就向車上一跳，喊我將行旅替他搬到車上，然後跨進車槓，兩手拉起車子，覺得車子的份量，有點超過了規定的限度，没奈何，只得用盡了力氣，向前跨開脚步走去，忽的一陣頭痛，幾乎把車子失手，竭力的忍住着，然而疼得四肢無力，免强慢慢的奔着，而這大胖子又惡聲的喊着猪玀，火車就要開了，快些跑，那時的我，喘着氣，頭又疼得很厲害，兩脚軟軟的用不出力來，那個大胖子又這様的不願諒我，我只好咬緊了牙關，忍住着疼痛，向着我認爲生命的路上奔去，費盡了九牛二虎之力，總被我拉到了目的地，將車子放下，把行旅一一的替大胖子搬下，他跳下車子，把二角小洋向地上一擲，（老搶拉呀拉不動），這大胖子惡很很的對我說，我也無法替他理論，祇得灣了腰去拾那老命換來的二角小洋，覺得眼前一黑，脚被車槓一絆，跌了一個狗吃尿，及我醒來，已在七路的Ｓ醫院平房裹，（移酬捐助兒童號）</p>

<h3>死與活</h3>
<p>— 彭年</p>
<p>不能病的我，却偏偏要病，時常要病；旣然這様會害病，我也惟有隨牠去病，病得更厲害更好，病到去見安樂府裹閻羅大王更好。</p>
<p>這天，我又害起病來了，而且這次病，害得很是厲害，我想這次病終可逹到（死）的願望，但是結果，却大失所願，我竟不死，漸漸地好起來了。這様厲害的病，還不給我（死），我想（死）也是一件非常不容易的事情啊！</p>
<p>我旣然得不到（死），曉得自已還不可死，還没有（死）的資格，所以我只好把死的願望置之腦後，而尋（活）的生路。爲要尋求活的生路，那只好由我去幻想一切了：</p>
<p>（金樽太香檳，四十二萬······高大的洋房，煞亮的汽車，香艶的美人，多麽快樂！多麽幸福！）一時這種幻想在我的心房裹，不住底旋轉，一幕一幕從腦袋裹放映出來，這時，浮沉心上的一種悅快，眞不可與方才的死念同日而語了。</p>
<p>突然間，恐怖的字幕，接連躍入我的眼廉，在眼眶裹不住底打滾。</p>
<p>（石門口吃緊···孫殿英孤軍血戰，急待後援···宋哲元大刀隊神勇···口口三得三失···ＸＸ國忽然袒日···）這時候，我又掀起死的念頭：（旣然要死，何不到疆塲上去死呢！到那裹去死，不是死有代價嗎？不是比病死來得光榮嗎？而且那裹必定能夠實行我死的願望！）</p>
<p>一時我的心房裹湧起各色各様的情緒。正當似聯珠般在想死念的時候，突然面前閃過一輛汽車，死的思線，又被打斷了，重掀起活的思波。</p>
<p>（金樽大香檳，四十二萬···高大的洋房煞亮的汽車，香艶的美人，多麽快樂！多麽幸福！）</p>

<h3>店員通訊</h3>
<p>老變編者先生：</p>
<p>我的姑母今年有五十歲了，姑丈是在本鎭上做地保。幾十年來，家庭中極融融之樂。生了二個兒子：大的現在在○○長途汽車公司服務，小的在滬上○○印刷公司當練習生。</p>
<p>幾年前：姑丈在本鎭上結識了一個女人，暗暗裹來去了有二三年。後來請了幾個親友，在一家館子裹，行了幾個禮，算是明媒正娶了。</p>
<p>那女人進門以後，起初到還相安，一二個月以後，漸漸的現出原形來了。處處和人的姑母爲難：唆使姑丈和姑母不和；離間表嫂與姑母的感情。弄得父子如寃家，夫妻像對頭。後來又煽動父子倆各自爲炊，對於兒子的伙食，毫不顧問。</p>
<p>我姑母是在姑丈處吃的，但是不過一碗淡飯：他們呢，將東西藏在别處吃。唉！凡此種種，一言難盡，我姑母也只得含酸自咽，忍涙呑聲罷了！</p>
<p>爲了這様，姑母得了一種病，如瘋如痴，不省人事，早也哭晚也啼，茶飯不吃，飲食不進。後來我大表兄千方百計百様安慰，稍得好些。</p>
<p>唉！狠心的姑丈，他天良没有了麽？他聽了那女人的話，大約在春節前後，要搬到别處去了。他最近向我父親聲明，不要我的姑母出去，仍舊住在原處，每月單給幾斗米，其餘不關。</p>
<p>爲了這種情形，我的姑母，舊病又發了！</p>
<p>現在把幾個要點寫下：　　（一）我姑母如其同他們住在一塊，姑丈也不見得答應，就是姑母也不見得願意，因爲是受不了氣。</p>
<p>（一）如其是二塊住，但是他只答應每月貼幾斗米，那嗎，像零用，衣着，小菜，油鹽醬醋等等，怎様着落呢？</p>
<p>（一）就是說請親友們去勸姑丈，要求貼補我姑母，但是他只是唯唯否否，到月底不給或少給，那便怎様呢？</p>
<p>（一）就是說姑母到表兄處吃，但是那表兄他所得無幾，自已又要維持一個門頭的，</p>
<p>編者按：刑法規定，犯重婚罪者，處三年以下有期徒刑：而且知情而相婚者，也要同様處刑。王君的姑丈，當然是犯了重婚罪，只要你的姑母出首一告，包管他就要鎁鐺入獄；就是那個女人，也不能倖免呢。不過他這種不法行爲，祗侵害你姑母一人的權利，與社會上一般秩序，並無多大應響，所以法律規定，除非被害人出首告訴，可以不予檢舉。你的姑母，在過去幾十年裹，倡隨甚樂，怕不會有怎種决心，定要使他嘗鐵窗風味吧所以這件事，要用法律解决，難處倒不在訟則終凶與否，而在你姑母下不起這一手罷了。所以這件事的進行，我們以爲必須要考察你姑丈的力量。要是他手裹，有幾個錢的話；那末狀雖則可以不告，但是大可以托一個律師，警告他一下。弄幾個錢來，以娛晚境，也是落得的。萬一他手中並没有多大財産，那末祇能放過了他。你的姑母呢，祇得去依你的表兄過活；雖則他們也並不寛裕，但也祗能當他死了，少不得也要勉强度過的。他旣經老變，由他去鬼混罷了。山窮水盡，倦而知返，也是不久的事情呀！</p>
<p>爲了這様，我父親也徵過了許多人的意見。去要求姑丈吧！狠心的他！必定没有使你滿意的答覆，仝他涉訟吧？又懹了訟則終凶的恐懼。這不得，那不得特把這一段情由，向先生所說，請你想一個萬全之計。此請撰安</p>
<p>主一鳴謹啓</p>

<h3>夢裹光陰（三十四續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鵑</p>
<p>（旣然是他。那末你的確該想法子照料一下）劉女士對於這個原則表示贊成。</p>
<p>（他大槪是我們的親戚吧？）伍源又開口了。（但是，爸爸，照料也得瞧情形才好，現在已是我們中華民國的生死關頭了，每一個國民，都應該有十分的覺悟，我們當大學生的責任尤其重大，不但自已要覺悟，還得去勸導别人；像王國棟這様的行爲，眞是一頭害羣之馬，我們爲國家前途着想，爲愛國運動着想，必須把他從嚴懲戒，給許多人做一個榜様！漢奸胡立夫的不槍斃，乃是政府的腐敗，當局的昏庸，如果我們也把王國棟輕輕放過了，這便是學界的腐敗，學校當局的······）最後一句話，伍源祗說了五個字，便不好意思再說下去了，但是他的握拳透爪的表情，已很明顯地告訴他老子，爲着這件事情，他實在是不勝其憤懣了。</p>
<p>伍逸埀下了頭，悄悄地靜聽着他令郎的教訓，連正眼也不敢向他看。（你别怎様發躁！你爸爸的見識，奈道反不如你嗎？）劉女士瞧他丈夫是特别的和馴服小，而她兒子却一味的擺着盛氣相凌的態度，這様顛倒的形勢，她認爲是太過分了，便竭力的糾正着。</p>
<p>（我不躁啊，）祇問爸爸究竟是這様的打算？（此刻王國棟又在那裹？）伍逸向學生會要求把王國棟交代他去看守的一番舉動，理由委實很不充足，非但劉驥和其餘許多同學都極懹疑，就是伍源，也　得他老子的負責看管的聲明，很不可靠，因此他便絲毫不肯放鬆的急着要知道王國棟的下落。</p>
<p>（你一定要知道嗎？孩子！）伍逸明知事實的眞相已到了非宣布不可的地位上了，但是還想掙扎一番。</p>
<p>（爸爸，何必不給我說明呢？）小伍先生的鋒利的反問。（好；那末我老實給你說吧！方才我已把王國棟送上車站，讓他搭車回上·········）一個二百鎊重的燃燒彈，在伍逸的面前爆裂了，火星滿屋子的亂滾，着火最旺的伍源，已像一頭肚子裹正在閙飢荒的小老虎一般的蹦了起來，劉女士也不能自制地立刻變了臉色；就是那十六歲的小兒子，伍豪因爲方才已聽他哥哥講過一篇王國棟的事情的緣故，也知道他老子的放走王國棟，的確不是一種適當的措置，便同様的把含着質問性的目光，望伍逸這邊投來。</p>
<p>伍逸在送王國棟上車的時候，便料到自已會因此受到一些麻煩，當然，家庭裹的小爭執，也是他所預料定的麻煩之一；所以他對於他們母子三人的敵意的表示，完全不覺得詫異。</p>
<p>（請你們原諒我，像原諒一個路人一様！）伍逸的右手裹，柱着一支竹制的手杖，左手便用來拈弄他的短鬚，態度是像一個死犯在　悔一様的誠懇。（你們的媽媽是知道的！王國棟不是别人，乃是我的一位已死的老朋友的兒子。當初，這一位老朋友，曾經很眞誠地把無代價的精神上底安慰賜給我，而且又極忠實地代我開闢了一條新的生路·····我不敢用别種的稱謂去侮辱她，祇能說她是我的生平唯一的知已，而王國棟却是她唯一的愛子！照理講，王國棟旣到了南京來念書，我爲紀念他的先人起見，自該盡心照料他，教導他，方不愧爲一個息息相關的父執；但是，不幸得很，······不幸得很，我竟一味的自私自利，整天不停的喝酒，休說不曾照料他，教導他，簡直話也没有和他說過，所以王國棟之有今日，我實在難辭其　！至少該員一半的責任······！）</p>
<p>眞誠的懺悔，使他自已也忍不住滾下眼涙來了，劉女士接着也陪了一聲長歎，立即緩和了，她個人底敵對的形勢：可是年少氣盛的伍源，却還不曾把憤火消去。</p>
<p>（但是，爸爸，你往日不是最能愛護學生們的愛國運動嗎？；如今閙了這一塲巴戲，請問你怎様可以對得起我們的中華民國？）愛國心正在伍源的軀壳裹活躍着，他把這件事情看得比一切都重大，認爲不能懲戒王國棟，必使一切愛國運動爲之瓦解，簡接就有促進亡國的可能，因此他對於他老子的由情感之衝動而放走王國棟，竟絲毫没有寛恕的表示。</p>

<p>中國自有電影以來，雖然爲時甚暫，趕不上外國；但也已有十餘年了。說起它的成績呢，除了花様新了些外，委實没有什麽差强人意的地方。却是突飛猛進，一日千里。我們若要尋求其所以然的原因，總不外我國電影界不自勞力所致。其最具體，最露骨的表現有四種：</p>
<p>（一）喜模仿中國電影演員之缺少涵養，已爲一般人週知的事實；稍爲學到了些皮毛成績的人，却要沾沾自喜，硬把外國已成名演員大名之上，冠以（東方）兩字，以自矜誇了。記得以前美國電影小演員賈克哥根，因爲聽得中國有人把他的名字來做頭銜，他的天眞的心靈，感到不愉快。對人說道：（我不曉得這位小朋友怎様，但要是他做提比我好，何必把我的名字來利用？要是做得比我壤，何苦把我的名字來糟榻）？這眞是愧煞中國電影演員了。</p>
<p>（二）愛捧塲中國的電影演員，雖没有涵養，並且缺乏演作技能，但他們却都愛人家捧他們的場女演員様様兒生得好些，就喜歡人家捧之爲（明星），（皇后）更有因人在大捧期塲他們便自認爲技術已逹絶頂，驕矜不可一世。於是就此固步自封不再向前加鞭了。最是深堪痛惜的。要曉得外國演員的眞正演技，都從自身努力而來，絶非靠人捧塲出來的。</p>
<p>（三）剿襲這兒所說的剿襲，是指剿襲外國片而言。像最近所映一張獸片，除演員外，外景中的獸，都是剿襲而來；這雖說還是僅見，但此風一開，人人便得互相效尤，而（國産片）的聲價便要墮入（爪哇國）去了。騰笑全球，自亦必然。要是因此而引起外國影片商的反感，更是我國電影界大失體面之事。</p>
<p>（四）吹牛一片之出，是要供人們的觀賞的，好歹自有人來下定評。却不能在公映之前，過分自吹。要是以爲非此不足以吸引觀衆，亦須明白即使他們這回被你吸引來觀你貴片而失望了，下回也許不敢再來領教了，那不反倒自討没趣了嗎？</p>
<p>以上我已把我國電影界最不好的四種現象說明了，我國電影之所以没有成績，不得發展，及不能與外國片一様，獲得國際的地位，就是這四種現象爲厲之階：今後我國電影界如不欲謀擴張，不欲與外國片並駕齊騙，甚至與外國片相頡頏則已，否則必須在這四者上痛自反省，發無努力始可。（不受酬）</p>

<h3>評（歌臺恨史）ＴＨＥＳＥＣＲＥＴＯＯＦＭＡＤＡＭＥ</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>故事虚構演出甚佳在這裹有一個虚構的ＲＯＭＡＮＣＥ。一個歌女爲一貴族少年所愛戀，雖經少年的父親極力反對，但少年寗與父絶，仍與歌女纒綿。不久，少年因困於經濟，復不得父親之諒解，乃自殺。從此歌女撫其遺腹子，仍操舞業。其後糼子被翁奪去。多年以後，在一九一八年第一次世界大戰時，半老的歌女偶然與其子遇。是時子因戀愛而殺人，母因愛子故决然代其受罪。但因口供錯誤故終於罪及其子。於是這歌女祗好俟其子徒刑滿後而團圓。</p>
<p>很顯然的這是浪漫派小說最好的情節，當然，在銀幕上也很能夠動人感情的。雖然（少年維持之煩惱）不一定眞的就發生在現實的人間，可是善於傷感的</p>
<p>人們，又有誰能不爲虚構的故事所感動，甚至於歎服這主人翁（人格）之偉大呢？</p>
<p>關於演出，可以說本劇確是相當成功的。</p>
<p>最初對於主人翁之介紹，僅僅祇是短短的兩幕，而第二幕便是一塲歌舞，立刻適合了資本主義電影之主要條件，這不能不歸功於導演之運用得當。其後前小半頗屬平庸，而且又不免利用（巧遇），但是對於主人翁的個性描寫，却很生動。直到貴族少年自殺之後，全劇乃漸入佳境，簡而捷的一幕逼緊一幕，一點也不鬆懈。尤其是幾　高潮，　於導演之聰明以及女主角愛琳杜呢（ＩＴＥＮＥＤＵＮＮＥ）的細膩的表演，確是本片臻於佳境。其他如法庭中的塲面，本來是很不易於安排的，但是導演善於使用大寫，所以毫不呆板，而且成爲精采之處。　　無疑義的，女主角愛琳杜尼的表演，在本片中確是得着很好的成績。從自已的孩子失去之後，一直到法庭中强辯，都很緊張而逼眞。很顯然的後半部比較前半部生色，也許是她適宜於飾中年婦女之故，然而在一片中能有兩種不同年齡的表情和動作，却也不易。</p>
<p>但是配角平庸，其他如佈景等等，一對小威利，同時和嬌嬌姑娘發生了戀愛，而嬌嬌姑娘，也不分軒輊的愛上了他們倆。這一段三角戀愛的故事，是發生在（桃花村）裹它是德國烏發和英國高蒙聯合攝製的一部英語對白新片子，不久將在上海公映。主角是麗琳哈蕙（中）賈克霍爾勃（左）和遜尼海爾（右）均無特色。至於關於本片的意義，在這裹我不想多加解釋，反正美國電影除了給人們娛樂或者企圖博得紳士或淑女們的讚嘆之外，乃是不會有其他的用心而値得我們熱望的吧。</p>
<h3>克萊拉寳愛國熱誠</h3>
<p>— 興之</p>
<p>克萊拉寳和她的丈夫游歷歐洲，現已一月多。據歐洲傅來消息，克萊拉到歐之後，其平日所用一切物品，除食料之外雖一襲内衣亦未尚購買。至不得已時，亦必向商店購美國出品。克萊拉在未起程前預先在美國製就衣服甚多，約値價八千餘金元，所以在巴黎雖然天天改變衣服的式様，尚能不感缺乏。巴黎各巨商在克萊拉未抵歐洲時，本預料此次必有一番好生意做，殊不料克萊拉抱定非美國貨品不買的宗旨，一般人眞覺得出人意料之外。然而法國商人對於克萊拉的愛國心，並不因爲没有好生意而怨恨，並且很尊敬克萊拉寳。</p>
<h3>評（一粒痣）ＢＲＯＴＨＥＲＡＬＲＡＤ</h3>
<p>— 磊</p>
<p>本來一個滑稽片，决不能僅僅以可笑的動作，來估價它的好坯，反之，必定要有充實的内容。假如只以胡調的動作，來博得觀衆們糼稚的笑聲，那末必然的會遭受人們的指斥。</p>
<p>凡是看過（一粒痣）的人們，大槪都會覺得它的故事，穿插得很是可笑的。但是嚴格的說來，也無非祇是一個笑括而已。旣然如此，那末製片者的目的，也僅是呌娛樂的觀衆們，在劇塲中笑笑而已。</p>
<p>關於本片的故事，我想不必在這裹叙述，反正看過的人，大家都會知道。　　因爲這故事發生在一個船上，所以祇是幾個簡單的場面，佈景當然不大費事。很少的幾個人物在銀幕上穿來穿去，假如不是劇情在不停的進殿，那末一定會使人感覺單調的。同時主角琪恩裘拉（ＧＥＮＥＧＥＲＲＡＲＤ）的動作，也不是如何純熟，有許多地方都顯然是在做戲。然而少數的幾個鏡頭，究竟還是使人發笑的。配角中更無足取。</p>
<p>如上所述，我們可以看出導演的平庸。假如他的手腕多少靈活一點，我想旣有了這様的一個比較活潑的嚴密的結構，一定可以獲得比此更好的成績。</p>
<p>至於其他的技巧，都是一些老方法在重複運用。佈景簡單。燈光平凡。特别是收音，那種雜音的嘈亂，簡直使對白都聽不清楚。他如旣以蒙特卡羅爲背景的穿插，應該有幾個悅目的塲面，可是在劇中這一點也没有做到。</p>
<p>總之。這是一部平凡的滑稽喜劇，雖然滑稽片的故事很難於都合乎情理，但在整個的演出上都不見佳。</p>
<h3>瓊克勞馥闢謠</h3>
<p>— 聲宏</p>
<p>好萊塢一度謠傅瓊克勞馥和小范朋克離婚已正式成立，於是各報紛紛刋載他倆離婚消息，無綫電台也播音報告，閙得滿城風雨，素和新聞記者絶緣的瓊克勞馥，因外間所播的謠言無非是捕風捉影，空穴來風，但因夫婦感情起見，破例接見一位新聞記者，鄭重闢謠，（先生），她說，（外間所傅謠言完全不確，我和小范朋克没有發生意見，先生，請你相信我，這謠言是絶對不確的啊。）</p>
<h3>電影小說忠魂錄ＣＡＶＡＬＣＡＤＥ（四）</h3>
<p>— 訥</p>
<p>琪茵最好的朋友，瑪格雷哈立斯夫人，亦不能像愛倫這様的親切愛護。但是瑪格雷亦知道琪茵的苦楚，她時來到琪茵家裹帮助愛倫去寛解琪茵的心。有時還帶着她的女孩兒呌靄蒂絲的來和琪茵的兩個男孩一起玩。</p>
<p>小孩子······要是没有這些小孩子。這度日如年的日子怎様過？愛德華和喬易，還有金黃色頭髮，莊重的　蒂絲和那嬌小玲瓏的　妮，愛倫的孩子都在一塊追着玩着。琪茵天天盼望她丈夫的音信，有時郵差一家一家地派着信，愛倫奔上去，探問消息。她垂頭喪氣地回來。琪茵聽說没有信，就覺得心旌搖搖，連聲喊着（我受不了啦，我受不了啦。）愛倫和瑪格雷一定在旁邊勸着說：（没有消息就是好消息······</p>
<p>時常街上賣報童子喊着（　事號外），琪茵連忙呌愛倫去買。等到看了没有什麽特别好新聞，琪茵垂頭喪氣地回到房裹，自言自語着：（没有新聞就是好新聞。）她越是自已想寛慰自已，她心中越覺難受。瑪格雷在旁邊看了，心中着實可憐她，又害怕。</p>
<p>有一天瑪格雷想出一個法子來。她請琪茵到外面去吃飯看戲。起初琪茵一定不肯去，她說：（我的兄弟在茂甫根，我的丈夫亦在前敵打仗，我怎能出去行樂呢？）可是瑪格雷一定要她去。琪茵没有法子違　她，祇好跟她出去了。</p>
<p>在那自家戲院子裹面，她們二人聽着戲，琪茵暫時的恢復了原狀。她很合理地跟着登上的做作，鼓着掌或笑着，雖然很明顯的，她是要使瑪格雷歡喜。但是正當表演一齣閙哄哄的喜刻的中間，院主忽然地來到臺前，舉起雙手。請大家靜下，那一　時間，琪茵的呼吸幾乎停止了。這一霎那間，是琪茵終身所不能忘記的。她恐　得如同就死的囚犯。她亦看見戲裹上的各種角色，臉上塗滿了油漆，呆若木鷄地站立在臺旁：表演亦停止了；觀衆一個一個張開了口，靜聽那院主要宣佈的重要消息，也許是極可怖的新聞。一刻間，院主尖銳的聲音，喊出來了！他說：</p>
<p>（茂甫根已經解圍了）。（未完）</p>

<h3>Tense Situation in the Upper Reaches of the Luan River</h3>
<p>The enemy prepares to forcibly cross the river with a large number of boats.</p>
<p>Enemy troops shell our positions at Yuhu Village.</p>
<p>East of Luan County, the enemy takes no active action.</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zunhua reports that the enemy on the front line of Sahe Bridge shelled our positions with heavy artillery this morning, firing over a thousand rounds. Four enemy aircraft simultaneously dropped bombs on our positions, but they have not moved. This morning at 9:00 AM, three enemy aircraft were spotted in Zunhua, dropping three bombs outside the city before flying east. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zunhua states that after the enemy's repeated large-scale attempts to cross the Luan River at our Nanbei Tuan Ting were repulsed, they changed their plans. This morning and last night, they transported a large number of boats, approximately over five hundred, and a large amount of raft materials from Rehe. They also seized hundreds of civilians, intending to use large rafts to block the Luan River and use heavy artillery to cover their troops and forcibly cross the river. Our side is on high alert and will engage in a decisive battle if the enemy attempts to cross the river. This morning, the enemy shelled us with heavy artillery at Yuhu, but their infantry did not dare to advance. At dawn today, eight enemy aircraft scouted our positions and dropped over twenty bombs before flying to Sancunying, Zunhua, Xinglong, Malan Pass, and other places for a long time. The front-line battle has recently become quiet. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy's military actions west of the Luan River are temporarily not aggressive. The reasons include: (1) The Japanese military believes that if they cross the Luan River, the war zone will expand, requiring at least three or four divisions, which would be quite difficult. (2) Moving across the Luan River would inevitably involve Tianjin and Beiping, causing great concern internationally. (3) Even from a military perspective, temporary success would be difficult to manage in the aftermath. Due to these three points, they are hesitant. However, this is only temporary, and in the future, they will undoubtedly disregard everything and launch a large-scale attack. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The entire Pumu unit of the enemy's 6th Division has been reinforced on our Xifengkou-Sahe Bridge line, totaling over ten thousand troops. The situation on the front line is increasingly tense. The enemy is determined to seize Sahe Bridge with all their might, and a major battle is imminent. A certain unit of ours is also reinforcing the front line. Song Zheyuan visited He Yingqin yesterday, discussing the front-line battles for a long time. Song Zheyuan will return to his post on the 22nd to command the battles. Pang Bingxun and Shang Zhen, along with other generals, are also scheduled to return to their posts on the 22nd. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Luan River area north of the railway line, the enemy and our forces are facing each other across the river. The enemy's main force seems to be moving towards the upper reaches of the Luan River to pressure the Song and Pang armies. Most of them are in the Dongzhai area. Li Jichun's puppet garrison headquarters is located in Changli. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy forces on the Luan Yang-Xifengkou line are still using fierce artillery fire to shell us, pressuring our troops. A certain unit, defending the line from Nanbei Tuan Ting to Sancunying, discovered enemy troops in Baita Village, north of Bei Tuan Ting, this morning. They were fiercely repulsed by us. The enemy has again increased the troops of the 16th Division this morning, seemingly preparing for a large-scale offensive. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces in Eastern Luan Reorganize Internally</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy forces in Eastern Luan are currently reorganizing internally, forcibly appointing puppet county heads to various counties to take charge of administration. The enemy is brewing a plan for the second phase of military operations, to cross the Luan River and invade the west. They will have new tricks in both political and military affairs to conceal their actions from international observers. They will expand the organization of the puppet Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. In addition to recruiting army commanders and soldiers from traitors, Japanese personnel will serve as staff officers, military assistants, and lower-ranking officers, all wearing Chinese military uniforms. This puppet army will be used as the vanguard for invasion. The enemy has repaired the railway tracks in Eastern Luan. Due to coercion by the Japanese military, all counties in Eastern Luan have changed to hanging puppet national flags. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Fly to Luanzhou for Reconnaissance</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Luanzhou reports that at 8:00 AM on the 21st, eight enemy aircraft flew to Luanzhou, scouting along the banks of the Luan River for a long time. They circled over the city several times before heading east. The battles east of the river are quiet with no major changes. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Fengshan Train Extends to Changli</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet Fengshan Railway train yesterday ran from Shanhaiguan to Changli, flying the Japanese flag. The enemy armored train is still stationed between Anshan and Shimen. Our Zhongshan armored train is also stationed on the east bank. The enemy east of Changli consists of two regiments of the puppet army under Li Jichun, showing no signs of advancing. The front lines are still quiet today. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The East Bank of the Luan River Becomes Quiet</h3>
<p>(Luanzhou) The east bank of the Luan River has become quiet, with no active movements from the enemy. A fierce battle is unlikely to break out in the short term. Currently, there are no large Japanese army units on the front lines east of the river. A large number of puppet troops are stationed along the Beining Railway line. At Shimen Station in Eastern Luan, there are over a thousand mixed Japanese and puppet troops. There are no enemy troops west of Shimen and east of Luanzhou, only small groups appearing and active. Our armored train is currently on alert at Zhuge Village, over ten li east of Luanzhou. There are Japanese troops stationed in the Lulong area, reportedly a division, but there are no special actions. The weather cleared on the 21st, and three enemy aircraft came to Luan City in the morning, circling for several weeks and scouting along the riverbank for a long time before flying to Lulong for reconnaissance. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Atrocities by Japanese Troops in Changli and Funing</h3>
<p>(Luanzhou) Puppet troops in Changli and Funing are committing rape and robbery, causing unrest. Seven police officers from the Beining Railway at Shimen Station were shot dead by Japanese troops for allegedly leaking military information. Similar incidents are too numerous to list. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Kailuan Mining Bureau Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>(Luanzhou) After the Beining Railway was destroyed, coal transportation from Kailuan was cut off, resulting in extremely heavy losses. It is now reported that the Kailuan authorities have lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Front Line is at Anshan Station</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, enemy infantry and cavalry units, totaling about two hundred, harassed our positions at Zhuge Village. Our Zhongshan armored train bombarded them, and our troops attacked the enemy's left flank. The enemy dared not advance further and retreated. This morning, our Zhongshan armored train has moved to between Zhuge Village and Shimen stations. Our Huguang armored train has moved from Tangshan to the east bank of the Luan River to protect the Luan River Railway Bridge. The enemy's front line is at Anshan. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Small Contact South of the Railway Line</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese and puppet troops were discovered at Leting, south of the railway line, making contact with our division in that area. A certain general in charge of the Beining line will return to the front within days to prepare a new defensive arrangement west of the Luan River. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zheng Guilin's Troops Occupy Zhuge Village</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The righteous army led by Zheng Guilin concentrated in an area west of the Luan River and selected over a thousand elite soldiers to form a suicide squad. On the 18th, he personally led them across the river to counterattack the enemy, driving them back. Our suicide squad then occupied Zhuge Village, stationed five or six li from the railway line to prevent enemy armored train attacks. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Addresses Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, Song Zheyuan addressed discharged wounded soldiers at his office, encouraging them to go to the front and kill the enemy. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog in Luan County, Japanese Aircraft Absent</h3>
<p>(Beiping) There was heavy fog in Luan County this morning, and Japanese aircraft did not come. The fighting east of Luan County has stopped, and there seems to be no contact on the front lines. A certain army is currently taking over the defense of the Luan River front. He Zhuguo is currently commanding in a certain location. The areas of Tangshan and Kaiping are calm. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Advance Along the Railway Line</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Over a thousand enemy infantry and cavalry arrived in the area of Wenfeng Bridge, south of Lulong, today, advancing along the railway line. The troops have passed Changli, and the vanguard has reached the line of Tuan Shan, Changshan, confronting our troops at Shi Tuan. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Defeated at Seshu Gully</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Our army's certain division's plainclothes squad defeated Japanese troops at Seshu Gully, outside Gubeikou, and captured a Japanese flag, a certificate, a counterfeit money ticket, three Buddha statues of longevity talismans, five Japanese officer business cards, a postal savings book, a car license plate, and a fake proclamation. This proclamation stated that Rehe was a part of Manchuria and that the Japanese army's entry into Rehe was to assist the Manchurian army in suppressing ugly elements. The wording is extremely absurd, nothing more than a one-sided justification of their aggression. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Visits Wan Fulin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan visited Wan Fulin tonight to discuss military matters on the front lines. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Recent Changes to the Song Army's Front Lines</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Zheyuan's Beijing office received a telegram from the front on the 20th: (1) Miyun was bombed, and enemy aircraft were also spotted in Sanhe. Li Jichun and others organized a puppet government, designating Eastern Luan as a special administrative region under the rule of the puppet state, and will establish a North China government after occupying Beiping and Tianjin. (2) From morning to night today, the enemy's artillery fiercely attacked us. Over two thousand new enemy troops arrived outside Panjiakou, carrying a large number of bridge-building materials and actively requisitioning timber and boats in the vicinity, showing signs of crossing the river. Our troops are on high alert. According to reports from the front, although Song's troops are surrounded on three sides by the enemy, they have established considerable contact with a certain unit, and although the fighting has been fierce in recent days, the front lines have not changed. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A General Overview of Recent Japanese Military Deployments</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Between Xifengkou and Dongjiakou, there are still the remnants of Hattori's 14th Mixed Brigade. Between Lulong and Qian'an, there is the entire 6th Division of the Japanese Army under Itagaki. Near Funing, there is Nakamura's 33rd Brigade of the 10th Division of the Japanese Army under Hirose. The 8th Brigade of the same division is in the lower reaches of the Songhua River. The two detachments of Sunagawa and Iwata between Linyu and Beidaihe have been reorganized into the puppet army under Li Jichun. Between Lingyuan and Zhongjian, there is Hiraga's 28th Brigade of the 14th Division of the Japanese Army under Matsuki Naoaki, responsible for rear-area liaison and railway security. In addition, there is the main force of the 16th Division under Pumu, currently moving from Pingquan towards Yulong. It is anticipated that this unit of enemy troops intends to attack between our Gubeikou and Xifengkou. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Rehe west area, the current Japanese military force only has the 23rd Regiment of the 6th Division stationed near Weichang. The cavalry 4th Brigade of Motegi was formerly stationed north of Weichang in the Qipanshan Xinba area. Recently, the main force of the Motegi Brigade and the 23rd Regiment are said to have gradually moved toward Pingquan and Chengde. Near Fengning, the Japanese only have a detachment of the 8th Division's Miyake cavalry, cooperating with infantry and artillery, totaling about 1,600 to 1,700 men. Between Gubeikou and Luowenyu, there is currently the 16th Brigade of the 8th Division of the Japanese Army under Kawahara. The main force is near Gubeikou.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Still Bomb Tangshan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) There is panic in the streets of Tangshan as Japanese aircraft bomb the city daily. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Deserters Crossing the Sea Have Been Captured</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 18th, troops without unit numbers retreated from the front to Beitang. In addition to being disarmed by the local garrison, a portion boarded a boat and headed towards the Junhe Estuary. Fan Pujiang, the commander of the Dagu Coastal Defense, immediately dispatched the Guan Hai gunboat to pursue and disarm them on the 20th. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Launches Fierce Attack on Our Left Flank at Gubeikou</h3>
<p>Driven Back After An Hour of Intense Fighting</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Shixia and Other Places</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shixia reports that at dawn today, the enemy shelled the area of Bada Ridge, the left flank of our Nantianmen position, with heavy artillery, firing approximately over three hundred rounds. They then advanced with infantry and launched a fierce attack on our position. Our troops responded with machine gun fire. The two sides engaged in intense fighting for an hour before the enemy was unable to sustain the attack and retreated. After a while, four enemy aircraft dropped bombs and bombarded Nantianmen, Shixia, and other places. We suffered no major damage. As of the time of dispatch, the enemy is still shelling our side. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the rear areas of the enemy forces outside the two passes of Xifengkou and Gubeikou, there has been a busy reinforcement and troop movement in recent days, seemingly preparing for active operations at the two passes. At Gubeikou's left flank, the enemy fired over two hundred rounds of artillery at us this morning, and small units charged our positions but were quickly repulsed. There were no other changes. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At Seshu Gully near Gubeikou, an absurd proclamation by the enemy was discovered, attempting to use pacification methods to numb the people of Huairou and implement a enslaving policy of governing on the 23rd. Shamelessly, they even claimed to be practicing benevolent governance and saving the people of Rehe, which is extremely shameless. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Gubeikou reports that at midnight on the 20th, two enemy aircraft flew to Miyun for reconnaissance. At 7:00 AM on the 21st, the enemy used fifteen heavy artillery pieces and over twenty field guns to fiercely attack the left flank of Nantianmen, the Badao Louzi area, firing approximately over four hundred rounds, followed by over two hundred smoke bombs. At the same time, approximately over two thousand infantry, using the smoke bombs as cover, launched a fierce attack on Badao Louzi from Pochengzi and Dongtaoyuan. Our infantry, taking advantage of the enemy's smoke bombs, counterattacked the enemy, who were unable to sustain the attack and retreated eastward towards Pochengzi. The enemy suffered approximately 700 to 800 casualties. In the afternoon of the 21st, the enemy transported over a thousand reinforcements by truck and launched another fierce attack on Badao Louzi. Their artillery concentrated fire on the two fortresses on the right flank, firing over five hundred rounds, and enemy aircraft also dropped many bombs in the area, causing no losses. The enemy infantry all carried light machine guns, covering the attack with extremely intense firepower. They were fiercely attacked by our infantry coalition, and the enemy suffered more than half casualties. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two new regiments of Japanese troops arrived this morning near Baima near the left flank of Gubeikou, pressing on our left flank positions, but were quickly repulsed by our division. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The battle at Gubeikou is extremely fierce and has not stopped as of 7:00 PM tonight. Japanese aircraft also came to Shixia for reconnaissance this morning. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telephone report from Miyun at 11:00 PM on the 21st stated that two enemy aircraft flew to Miyun at midnight on the 20th and dropped bombs before leaving after a long time. It seems that there are traitors in nearby villages using electric lights to signal the enemy. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Decides to Go to Baoding to Take Command</h3>
<p>Entrusting the Communist Suppression to Liu Zhi</p>

In addition to ordering certain units to continue the resistance, Chiang decided to personally go to Baoding to take command in the short term, entrusting the Communist suppression in Jiangxi to Liu Zhi. Important military leaders in Beiping received Chiang's telegram and decided to return to their posts separately on the 21st. External rumors are not to be believed. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Several top military leaders in North China, considering the extremely tense anti-Japanese military situation in North China, jointly sent a telegram to Chiang, requesting him to immediately go north to take command of the anti-Japanese war.

<p>Saying that Japanese Military Operations Have Come to an End</p>

Tanaka, the Japanese Vice-Consul in Tianjin, went to the provincial government on the 21st to probe for information. He casually said that Japanese military operations have come to an end. His intention seems to be to investigate whether our army has any intention of counterattacking Eastern Luan. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>With Li Jichun as Commander</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet state will appoint Li Jichun as the garrison commander of the eight counties in Eastern Luan, in charge of military and civilian affairs, as the initial step in building a North China state.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Crisis in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>When the September 18th Incident occurred, many domestic opinions advocated using diplomacy to conduct peaceful negotiations with Japan to avoid escalating the situation. The proposal of a desperate resistance was considered high-sounding, unrealistic, and emotional. Some even said that we should completely trust the League of Nations and maintain the international community's belief that justice was on our side, waiting patiently for the final victory. All these erroneous views stemmed from misunderstanding the motives of the September 18th Incident as an isolated event caused by a few reckless Japanese warlords and fundamentally failing to correctly understand the international situation under the economic crisis. In particular, they fundamentally failed to correctly understand the inevitability of imperialists attempting to redivide colonies under the surge of the economic crisis. Therefore, they believed that through peaceful means, making conditional negotiations with Japan, and at the same time, borrowing international treaties to pressure Japan, the Northeast crisis could be resolved and we could obtain temporary peace. This kind of illusion should have been shattered by the cruel facts today, and this kind of mistaken observation should have been corrected by the cruel facts today.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident two years ago, we have firmly believed that the outbreak of the incident was a planned and step-by-step act of aggression by Japanese imperialists. At the same time, we have firmly believed that so-called international treaties are spells to deceive the weak, and under the surge of the economic crisis, the great powers are too busy taking care of themselves and cannot give us any assistance. Therefore, we have consistently and resolutely advocated seeking self-help and self-salvation through our own efforts, maintaining the survival of our nation through thorough resistance, and responding to the aggressive atrocities of Japanese imperialists with a national revolutionary war. Any sacrifice and any hardship should be endured. This firm stance and the ironclad reality of the past year and a half have also proven that it is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Today, Eastern Luan has fallen again, and Beiping and Tianjin are in imminent danger. Government officials are still unwilling to let cultural relics be seized and trampled by the enemy and are eagerly thinking about how to protect them. So, how will they defend the current precarious situation of the land and people of North China? How will they protect Beiping and Tianjin? If they consistently fail to make firm plans, we are truly foolish and do not know what can be done. The ambition of Japanese imperialists is so great that it is impossible for our nation to find even a corner to live in peace. This can be proved by the fact that the enemy has been gaining ground since the September 18th Incident. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent. Will we wait for death or fight to the death for survival? Looking around at our mountains and rivers, we are overcome with grief. Has a nation with a 5,000-year history lost its ability to maintain its survival today? We dare not believe it, and we are unwilling to believe it. Compatriots, what should we do today?</p>

<p>Regarding the Sino-Eastern Railway Issue</p>
<h3>Russia Reaffirms Ownership of Locomotives in Reply to the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>Declares that it Should be Resolved According to the Treaty</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Refute the Russian Protest</p>
<p>Sino-Eastern Railway Club Searched</p>
<p>(Moscow) A TASS news item released here today states that on April 13th, the (Manchukuo) foreign affairs official sent a document to Soviet Consul General to Harbin, Slavutsky, reiterating the demand for the return of certain (E) locomotives of the Soviet Railway to the Sino-Eastern Railway. According to this document, these locomotives had long been designated by the Soviet Union as purchased by the Soviet Union and scattered on the Sino-Eastern Railway during the Allied intervention in Siberia. The (Manchukuo) document refutes Slavutsky's note of September 12, 1932, which explained that these locomotives were Soviet property, stating that the Soviet Union had no documentary basis for its ownership of these locomotives. The document acknowledges that these locomotives were indeed not recorded in the property catalogue of the Sino-Eastern Railway, but believes that the fact that there had been no dispute regarding their ownership until recently could be regarded as evidence that they belonged to the Sino-Eastern Railway. (Manchukuo) therefore requested that these locomotives be returned to the Sino-Eastern Railway and that the Soviet Railway pay rent to the Sino-Eastern Railway. In his reply to the (Manchukuo) document on April 18th, Slavutsky reiterated the reasons for the Soviet Union's ownership of these locomotives and attached documentary evidence and records of the Sino-Eastern Railway Council acknowledging that these locomotives were Soviet property. Regarding the (Manchukuo) request that the Soviet Railway pay rent, Slavutsky stated that the Soviet government was indeed considering settling this huge debt, as its locomotives had been used by the Sino-Eastern Railway for many years without payment. The Soviet government intends to raise this matter at an appropriate time. In conclusion, Slavutsky informed (Manchukuo) that the Soviet representatives on the Sino-Eastern Railway, in accordance with the instructions of the Soviet government, have always strictly adhered to the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian agreements and regarded these two agreements as the basis for resolving all issues. At the same time, it is hoped that the (Manchukuo) authorities will also abide by these agreements and not hinder the normal operation of the Sino-Eastern Railway in the future. (TASS dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) It is reported that Li Shaogeng, the director of the Sino-Eastern Railway, sent a letter to Kushnir, the Soviet representative of the Sino-Eastern Railway, on April 12th, requesting that the trains moved into Russian territory be returned within one month.

The number of vehicles to be returned was listed as 83 locomotives, 194 passenger cars, and 3,200 freight cars. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Statement in Berlin</h3>
<p>The Eastern Provinces Can Never Be Conquered by Japan</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Still Active, Continuing Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, a Reuters interviewer met with Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, Li Du, Wang Delin, and others who had just arrived here from Soviet Russia. Ma Zhanshan explained in humorous terms that they had not been detained by Soviet Russia because China and Japan should not have been at war in the first place. Therefore, after disarming, the Russian authorities allowed them to leave the area. Ma further stated that the Japanese army will not attack Beiping because the current Japanese army's advance within the Great Wall is merely a strategy to drive the Chinese army out of Jehol. Although Jehol is outwardly occupied by the Japanese army, the informal Chinese army within its borders is still active. Ma concluded by saying that the three eastern provinces still belong to China and can never be conquered by Japan. China will continue to fight until the invaders are driven out of the country.

<p>(Washington) The Washington Evening Star published an editorial stating that General Ma Zhanshan (returning from the Isle of Elba), (The Isle of Elba is the place where Napoleon I was exiled in 1814, implying that General Ma Zhanshan has regained his freedom of action since returning from Russia,) his relationship is of greater importance than ordinary people can anticipate. At this moment, Moscow's attitude towards Japan has a tendency to change, which can be seen in various circumstances. Until now, Soviet Russia has adopted a wait-and-see policy, but now it expresses dissatisfaction and does not conceal it. Therefore, it is not impossible that General Ma's return to the country is a sign of rapprochement between China and Russia. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Representative Ishii Utters Mad Words Before Going to Washington Conference</h3>

He intends to do his best to persuade the leaders of the United States and China to understand the absolute necessity of the joint efforts of the two nations and governments of China and Japan to solve mutual problems. Ishii is scheduled to depart for Washington on May 4th. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In recent days, the seven ministers of Internal Affairs, Navy, Army, Commerce, Agriculture, and Colonization have held important discussions regarding the instructions to be given to Ishii and other Japanese representatives participating in the conference in Washington and London. The representatives of the seven ministers will hold a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tomorrow to finalize the draft of the instructions. According to reports, the main points of the draft instructions are as follows: (1) Japan cannot unconditionally approve any proposal to restore the gold standard, as 70% of the world's cash is currently held by the United States and France. (2) Japan is prepared to seek international cooperation from the central banks of various countries to implement a policy of easing lending. Japan is also willing to sincerely support the management of currency values. (3) Japan advocates using the lending business of the Bank for International Settlements to restore credit and ensure the stable circulation of funds. (4) Japan must strive for the revival of international commerce, and the trade barriers between countries must be removed. (5) Attention should now be paid to the tariffs implemented by Japan in 1909, which have never been increased. (6) The great powers should unconditionally adopt the principle of most-favored-nation treatment. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that the preferential tariffs of the British Empire violate the fundamental spirit of international commercial treaties. (7) The production and export of goods should be managed so that production and consumption are balanced. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister and Entourage Arrive in New York</h3>
<p>Salute of Nineteen Guns Fired as Ship Enters Port to Express Welcome</p>
<p>After Landing, Immediately Take Special Train Directly to Washington</p>
<p>British and French Planned Programs Affected by US Gold Embargo</p>
<p>Roosevelt Claims No Intention to Exercise Big Stick Policy</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 21st - British Prime Minister MacDonald and his entourage arrived here at noon today. A salute of nineteen guns was fired as the ship entered the port. After landing, the British Prime Minister and his party immediately took a special train to Washington. Tonight, they will dine with President Roosevelt at the White House.</p>
<p>Guomin, New York, 20th - Prime Minister MacDonald's first comment on the United States' abandonment of the gold standard was released to the Associated Press via wireless telephone today, stating that this move has greatly changed the situation he had prepared to discuss with President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 21st - French representative Herriot and his party are currently traveling to Washington aboard the French ship "France" to speak with President Roosevelt. News from the ship today states that the French representative's planned program has been completely overturned by the US gold embargo. A certain representative recently told someone, "We might as well turn back."</p>
<p>Reuters, Guomin, New York, 20th - Before British and American leaders begin talks, regardless of what power the US Congress grants to the president, the British Prime Minister will also obtain greater power from his own country. Therefore, financiers returning from Washington today claim that the trend of world finance will actually hang on the hands of these two people. However, although both have great power, neither intends to use a big stick policy, but only want to use it to obtain the greatest understanding on trade and finance. News from Washington tonight states that Roosevelt believes that future talks have absolutely no risk of threatening other countries with power, but rather, this power is used to seek cooperation.</p>
<h3>US Abandoning Gold Standard Fuels Currency Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>Rural Relief Amendment Submitted to Congress Yesterday</p>
<p>Authorizes President to Issue More Currency, Reduce Coinage Metal Content</p>
<p>Allows Debtor Nations to Use Silver to Repay Debts for One Year</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Special Dispatch) – The US government's currency expansion bill has been submitted to both houses of Congress today. An emergency clause within suggests that the authorities are still uncertain whether the Federal Reserve Bank will fully cooperate with the entire plan. It is reported that the Senate will consider the bill first, but it is expected to pass quickly. Its contents are as follows: (1) Authorizes the Treasury Department to issue treasury bonds or other national debts, not exceeding $30 billion; (2) Authorizes the President to reduce the pure gold content of the gold dollar, but not by more than 50%; (3) Regarding the repayment of war debts, silver may be accepted, but the total value of silver paid by any debtor shall not exceed $100 million, and the price of silver shall not exceed 50 cents per ounce; (4) If the Federal Reserve Bank refuses to cooperate fully with the measure of issuing new currency to the maximum extent, or if issuing to the maximum extent is still insufficient to meet the emergency, the President, within certain restrictions, may order the issuance of $30 billion in national banknotes.</p>
<p>The aforementioned restrictions in item 4 contain practical measures for managing currency expansion, such as stipulating that banknotes issued by the President's own order can only be used to cover federal government debts due, repay national loans, purchase national bonds, or other securities for which the federal government is liable. Public bonds acquired in this way should be immediately cancelled, and the President shall appoint a representative to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board in handling the various provisions of this plan. The Federal Reserve Board's special function is to buy and sell government bonds to tighten or expand the currency in response to market needs. Furthermore, the war debt clause in item 3 stipulates a time limit of one year. Unless Congress extends the period, debtor nations wishing to repay with silver must do so within one year, and the total amount of silver paid by each debtor nation during this period shall not exceed $200 million. Currently, the entire nation generally expresses approval of this new measure. Farmers and industrialists with goods to sell are all jubilant, while individuals who live paycheck to paycheck are hesitant about this new plan, as they expect prices to rise but their income may not increase immediately.</p>
<h3>Thomas Releases Original Proposal Text</h3>
<p>Reuters, 20th, New York – Senator Thomas, who proposed amending the Rural Relief Act, today released the original text of his proposal. Other clauses are as follows: If the President cannot establish an agreement to purchase government bonds, he may directly issue $3,000,000,000 in treasury bonds, specifically for paying off maturing public bonds, repaying debts to the United States, and purchasing US public bonds and other interest-bearing securities. The President has the right to reduce the gold content in coinage, but not by more than half. The United States may allow debtor nations to repay war debts with silver worth $100,000,000 at US dollar value, with the price of silver not exceeding 50 cents per ounce. This clause is valid for one year. The government may issue silver coins according to the amount of silver received from foreign governments.</p>
<p>In addition, Senator Robinson formally issued a statement to President Roosevelt as follows: According to the intent of the amendment, one of its purposes is to support the President in negotiating methods to consolidate exchange rates, the strategy being (A) to adjust the composition of US gold coins through international agreements, or (B) to increase the use of silver by commercial nations, or to use both of the above strategies simultaneously. The intention is to equalize the price of silver at around 50 cents per ounce and issue silver certificates, and mint silver coins as standard currency and auxiliary currency, in a quantity sufficient to redeem the silver certificates. Government bonds obtained in exchange for treasury bonds must be cancelled. The government may allocate funds to allow the Ministry of Finance to redeem 4% of treasury bonds annually. Treasury bonds can be legal tender. Based on his investigation of how to guarantee US foreign trade and prevent the adverse effects of cheap paper money, the President may determine the weight of gold coins he deems necessary. If the US government establishes an agreement with any government stipulating the ratio between gold coins issued by the US and other countries, the President may determine the weight of gold coins according to the agreed ratio, and these gold coins must be standard currency.</p>
<h3>Republicans Prepare for a Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>To Obstruct the Passage of the Currency Bill</p>
<p>Washington, 21st (Special Dispatch) – The American gold dollar war has today moved from the exchange market to the Senate. The Republican minority, led by Senator Reed, the former speaker of the Senate under President Hoover, is preparing for a decisive battle against President Roosevelt's currency expansion plan. If necessary, they will even resort to filibustering tactics, hoping to prevent the bill from passing before British Prime Minister MacDonald leaves Washington, so as to avoid negotiating any international agreement to restore silver coinage or significantly devalue gold. Reed told people today that if the American people can accurately understand the nature of this bill, they will definitely oppose it. It is the duty of the congressional minority party to inform the people of its advantages and disadvantages. However, Reed also admitted that not all Republican senators may join this crusade to save the gold dollar. Senators from western states will support the President's proposal, and currently all those who hold securities, public bonds, or goods hope for market prices to rise. There is no doubt that the entire nation is willing to support the government.</p>
<h3>US Statement Denies Political Intent</h3>
<p>Havas, 21st, New York – The State Department has telegraphed to all ambassadors and ministers abroad, instructing them to explain to the governments of their host countries that the United States' abandonment of the gold standard is purely due to domestic economic conditions and has no other purpose, so as to consolidate the United States' position in future economic talks.</p>
<p>Havas, 20th, London – The Daily Express advocates that after the devaluation of the US dollar, the pound should be allowed to fall again, so that the various benefits Britain obtains in foreign trade will not be lost. Reactions to President Roosevelt's decision to ban gold exports vary. The public believes that no new facts have occurred in the United States' finances and economy to explain the ban on gold exports. This move is definitely purely political in nature. The general public expects that, due to the US ban on gold exports, the Bank of England authorities will have no choice but to take countermeasures and will hold a special meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Ban on Gold Exports Officially Announced</h3>
<p>Havas, 21st, Washington – President Roosevelt's order prohibiting cash exports has been officially announced. All exports to foreign countries, whether gold bullion or gold certificates, are prohibited. Exports by foreign governments, central banks, and the Bank for International Settlements are subject to licenses issued by the Treasury Department. The same applies to gold brought into the United States that is intended for re-export. Furthermore, transactions related to the public interest that require cash exports for compensation may be specially authorized by the Treasury Department.</p>
<h3>France Resolves to Maintain Gold Standard</h3>
<p>To Struggle Against American Commercial Aggression</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, Paris – After a meeting between the French Finance Minister and financial experts today, the Governor of the Bank of France declared that France is determined to maintain the gold standard and raise interest rates to struggle against potential American commercial aggression.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Sharp Fall in the US Dollar Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>National News, 20th, London – According to reliable sources in foreign exchange circles, the recent sharp fall in the US dollar on the world exchange market, although due to various reasons, is largely due to a speculative financial group on the European continent launching a fierce attack on the gold dollar. The capital of this speculative financial group mostly comes from New York. Having suffered two major blows, it is eager to recover and continues to attack the gold dollar. Therefore, some people in foreign exchange circles had long predicted that there would be such a sharp fall. About a month ago, it was felt that unless the Washington government issued a declaration to provide a complete explanation and the London financial community came forward to support the gold dollar, there might be unexpected changes in the US dollar exchange market. The continental European speculative financial group was organized when Britain abandoned the gold standard and has devalued the currencies of several countries. After its organization, it began to sell off pounds, but later suffered a major blow. Also, when the United States banned gold exports in early March, the speculative group was also in a short position. It is reported that during the ten days the US banks were closed, its sell-off amounted to as much as $350 million, but its meticulously planned attack failed again. The US dollar was able to maintain its position, and these people were forced to cover their positions, incurring heavy losses again. They then waited quietly for an opportunity to retaliate. Recently, since Washington has not issued any declarations to encourage the market and London is eager to set a trap to destroy this speculative financial group, willing to cooperate with New York when necessary to maintain the US dollar, the US government suddenly decided to no longer maintain the gold dollar price, making cooperation impossible. As for the position of the speculative group in the exchange market at present, it is still uncertain. However, London financial experts believe that it will try to recover its previous losses. When American hoarders began to return gold coins to the banks, it was believed here that there was no need to support the gold dollar artificially. Later, although there were voices calling for currency expansion, it was believed here that the United States would try to maintain the gold dollar price and that once the US banks resumed business, they could immediately maintain the status quo, not expecting this sudden abandonment of the gold standard. It is reported that the speculative group has branches in New York, Paris, Hamburg, and London. Its great power has caused much unease in the financial community.</p>
<h3>Great Anglo-American Currency Battle</h3>
<p>US Dollar Continues to Fall</p>
<p>Impact on British Trade</p>
<p>Havas Agency, 20th, Paris – (Le Petit Parisien) newspaper received a cable from its correspondent stationed in the United States, stating that a "great currency battle" is currently underway between Britain and the United States. The fall of the US dollar gives President Roosevelt a great strategic advantage. Today, the currencies of all countries in the world, except the franc, are unstable. It is impossible for international trade to prosper. Britain is feeling the most pain and will try its best to stabilize the currencies of various countries. However, if Britain cannot compromise with the United States, the US dollar may continue to fall to an extremely low level. If this happens, the prices of American goods will also fall, which will be a major disaster for British commerce.</p>
<h3>Netherlands and Belgium Do Not Abandon Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Reuters, 20th, The Hague – Previous rumors that the Netherlands would implement a ban on gold exports have been denied here. It is reported that all banks are well prepared and can cope with any wave of silver coins.</p>
<p>National News, 21st, Brussels – It has been formally announced today that the rumors that the Belgian government will abandon the gold standard or expand the currency are completely untrue.</p>
<h3>Unprecedentedly Active New York Market</h3>
<p>Paris Also Reacts</p>
<p>National News, 20th, Washington – General investors and speculators are all eager to take advantage of this continuously rising market. The forward price of silver surged to over 200 pounds in the first few minutes after the market opened today. Three million ounces were sold in less than ten minutes. Major near-term contracts also soared. The activity on the New York Stock Exchange is unprecedented since the economic recession of 1929. National banks are operating as usual, with no changes other than the trading of foreign exchange, which is prohibited by the President's executive order. The larger private banks, especially J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., generally support the President's ban on gold exports and currency expansion plan. According to news received by the Treasury Department, major New York bankers and financial leaders in other financial centers around the world fear that Britain may try to devalue the pound again to counter the fall of the US dollar. However, there is currently no formal indication of such a move, and financial experts are awaiting a statement from the authorities in London.</p>
<p>Havas, 20th, Paris – After the fall of the US dollar, the market here reacted, almost identical to the situation in the New York market. All securities rose, especially foreign securities. Only French public bonds were sluggish, with some falling by more than one point. The official price of the US dollar was 22 francs and 45 centimes. The price of silver soared.</p>
<h3>British Labour Party and Trade Unions Protest Boycott of Russian Goods</h3>
<p>Request Russia Release British Nationals to Preserve Anglo-Russian Relations</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, London – Today's joint meeting of the British Labour Party and trade unions decided to protest the ban on imports of Russian goods, calling it a violation of the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and decided to ask Moscow to release British nationals to preserve Anglo-Russian relations.</p>
<h3>Three British Engineers Leave Russian Territory</h3>
<p>Reuters, 20th, Moscow – British engineers Monkhouse, Cushing, and Nordwall of Vickers Electrical Company, who were sentenced to deportation, departed on the international express train at 10:45 PM tonight to return to England. Gregory, who was released, also accompanied them. In addition, Nordwall's wife and staff from the British Embassy in Moscow were at the station to see them off. Before leaving, the engineers' last action was to solemnly lower the British flag from the wooden house outside Moscow where they lived.</p>
<p>Reuters, 21st, Warsaw – British engineers Monkhouse and others from Vickers Electrical Company arrived at the Polish border station at 1:15 PM today. They were greeted by a large crowd. In addition to British journalists, Polish soldiers also came to welcome them. After the British engineers had a meal in the restaurant, they took a train to Warsaw and Berlin at 2:05 PM. Usually, the Russian political investigation bureau sends people to escort those being deported all the way to the border, but this time it was different. They were treated as ordinary passengers. The engineers were unwilling to express any opinions, which disappointed the journalists.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia and Norway Amend British Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>Daladier Receives Davis</p>
<p>National News, 20th, Geneva – The Secretariat of the League of Nations today released the amendment text of Norway and Soviet Russia to the British disarmament plan. The governments of both countries have accepted in principle the part of the British plan concerning security and provisions such as when any country violates the Kellogg-Briand Pact and there is a risk of violation, a conference of the signatory countries of the pact should be convened.) The Soviet Russian amendment defines the (aggressor country) and lists various possibilities of (immediate violation), such as presenting an ultimatum, blockade, diplomatic rupture, mobilization, or gathering troops on the border, naval and air force demonstrations, and declaring a state of siege.) The Norwegian amendment advocates that the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact should enact legislation as soon as possible so that when a country violates a resolution of the signatory countries' committee, its letter secrecy will naturally be abolished, the transportation of arms will be stopped to the aggressor country or its nationals, and financial assistance will be given to the invaded country at the same time.</p>
<p>Havas, 21st, Paris – Prime Minister Daladier received Davis, the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, this morning and had a long conversation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bomber Crashes into the Sea</h3>
<p>Reuters, 21st, Tokyo – A Japanese heavy bomber, which was flying to Taiwan this morning, crashed into the sea near the Ryukyu Islands. It is reported that one sergeant is missing. In addition, three light bombers and one heavy bomber have safely arrived in Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Korean Governor-General Ugaki to Visit Tokyo Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Related to the Japanese Political Situation</p>
<p>China United Press, 21st, Tokyo – Korean Governor-General Ugaki is scheduled to enter Tokyo in early May. On the surface, he will contact the government about next year's budget, but in reality, the Ugaki faction believes that a political change is imminent and is requesting Ugaki to return to Tokyo in order to compete for the next regime. Ugaki's trip will further shake the Japanese political situation. If Prime Minister Saito is indeed determined to step down, in order to prevent Suzuki and Hiranuma from taking power, the feudal remnants of the Upper House and the Satsuma-Choshu factions and the Minseito party will lean towards General Ugaki. However, Lieutenant General Araki's powerful faction is enough to sway the overall situation. It is worth noting what method this faction will use to cooperate with Araki.</p>
<h3>Debate in Chen Peng Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 26th of This Month</p>
<p>The case of Chen Duxiu, the leader of the Communist Trotskyists, and others endangering the Republic of China has been tried by the Jiangsu High Court at the Jiangning District Court's Criminal Division on the 14th and 15th of this month. On the 20th, the court continued to hear the case. Due to the public debate, it lasted even longer. The court was in session from 10:40 AM to 2:00 PM when it temporarily adjourned for a rest. It reconvened at 3:30 PM and the debate concluded at 6:30 PM. The sentencing is scheduled for the afternoon of the 26th of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Court Session Begins at 10:15 AM</h3>
<p>The court was originally scheduled to open at 10:00 AM on the 20th. Around 9:00 AM, spectators gradually arrived at the court to request the issuance of visitor permits. Some came from as far away as Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai specifically for the trip to Nanjing. However, the courtroom was not large enough to accommodate everyone, and many of those who arrived later were disappointed. By 10:00 AM, there was no space left in the spectator seats. Some stood on both sides of the seats, some stood behind the press seats, and some stood outside the room, totaling about 200 people. At 10:42 AM, presiding judge Hu Shancheng, judges Lin Zhemin and Zhang Chengci, clerk Shen Yuren, and prosecutor Zhu Jun ascended the bench. Defense lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Peng Wangye, Wu Zhiping, Liu Zuwang, and Jiang Shihao also arrived together. The clerk first announced that the hearing of the case of Chen Duxiu and others endangering the Republic of China would continue today. The judge then ordered Wang Ziping, He Afang, Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao, Liang Youguang, and Wang Jiantang to be brought to court to verify the records. There were no important corrections. Then, Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Wang Wu, and Pu Yifan were called to verify the transcripts of the second day's hearing. Chen Duxiu only made slight corrections to the party's ultimate goals and the party's alternate standing committee members. Wang Wu requested that the court inform him of the source of the evidence shown at the previous hearing, and Wang's defense lawyer Wu Zhiping also submitted a letter from Wang's family, stating that Wang's family had sent money urging Wang to return to Beiping, which could serve as proof that Wang had just left prison and had not participated in any activities.</p>
<h3>Final Court Hearing Conducted Twice</h3>
<p>After the judge had questioned each defendant separately, he conducted a final interrogation of Chen and the other ten defendants before the debate. First, Chen Duxiu was questioned: (Judge asked) This case has been tried again. I still have a few questions to ask. Is Wang Zhaoqun Luo Shifan? (Chen replied) No. (Question) You previously confessed that the standing committee members were you and Peng Shuzhi, and there was another one named Zhang Jiu, is that correct? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Is Luo Shifan a standing committee member? (Answer) He is an alternate standing committee member. (Question) Is Wang Zhaoqun an alternate standing committee member? (Answer) No. Next, Peng Shuzhi was questioned: (Question) How many standing committee members are there? (Answer) Chen Duxiu just said. (Question) How about alternates? (Answer) Pu Yifang and Luo Shifan. (Question) Xie Shaoshan said that all the standing committee members have been arrested, why is that? (Answer) We don't know what he said behind our backs. (Question) How about Luo Shifan? (Answer) He has not been arrested. (Question) Then Luo Shifan is another person? (Answer) Yes. Wang Wu was questioned again: (Question) Xie Shaoshan confessed that the place where he lived was the central organization, the place where the standing committee met, is that correct? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Xie confessed in the second branch of the High Court that Wang Wu is a standing committee member, but only attended the standing committee once? (Answer) According to Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi's confessions, it has been proven that I am not a standing committee member. The day I was arrested, I was not going to a meeting, but to borrow money. Moreover, according to Xie Shaoshan's confession, he also said that it was my first time visiting him there. As for whether I am a standing committee member, I will talk about it during the debate. Then, Pu Yifan, Wang Ziping, and the other seven people were questioned. Pu firmly stated that he was not a Communist. Wang Ziping and He Afang said that they were only working for the Trotskyists in printing and that it was an economic relationship. He also said that he felt that helping the Trotskyist Communists print publications was not illegal, but mechanical work like being a coppersmith. Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao, and the other four people still resolutely denied being Communist Party members. At this point, the court interrogation ended. It was 12:05 PM.</p>
<h3>The Prosecutor's Argument</h3>
<p>At 10:20 AM, after the judge finished questioning, Prosecutor Zhu Xie stood up to deliver his argument, stating briefly that the arrest of the defendants Chen Duxiu and the other nine had already been described in the indictment, and he further explained the evidence of the crimes of the ten defendants.</p>
<p>(Chen Duxiu) He confessed that he joined the Communist Party in 1920, served as the General Secretary in 1922, and the Communist Party failed in 1927 due to the purge, and because of his lack of success in his work, he was dismissed from the position of General Secretary. In 1929, he was expelled from the party for leaning towards the Trotskyist faction. Peng Shuzhi, Wang Ziping, He Afang, etc., were also expelled for leaning towards the Trotskyist faction. Therefore, they jointly organized the Chinese Communist Party Left Opposition. An investigation revealed that the defendant's expulsion was by the Stalinist faction, and he did not completely break away from the Communist Party. The difference between the Stalin and Trotsky factions is that the Stalin faction said that the period of insurrection had arrived, while the Trotsky faction said that it had not yet arrived. Strategically, the Trotsky faction advocated that the Red Army should be based on workers and peasants, while the Stalin faction even included bandits and robbers. In terms of methods, the Stalin faction advocated that Kuomintang members should also join, while the Trotsky faction advocated that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should be separated. All these are internal issues. From a legal point of view, they both advocate overthrowing the National Government and the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is the same thing. Their purpose is communism, which is harmful to the Republic of China. The defendant confessed that their current strength is not great, with only a few hundred people, mostly from the industrial sector, followed by the academic sector, and they have no strength to enter the rural areas and have no relationship with the Third International. This seems to be believable based on the evidence. Also, the defendant admitted to organizing the Communist Party, attended meetings in the past, and served as the chief party committee member. Therefore, the defendant has two responsibilities: (1) organizing the Left Opposition, he is the mastermind, so he is responsible for all propaganda orders. The defendant is of course also responsible for his personal speeches and writings. (2) Propaganda section, they have a system to carry out one goal. There are many writings, and the defendant is of course also responsible. The important writings, published in common names and individual names, include Political Resolutions, The Current Situation and Our Tasks, A Letter to the People on the Seventh Anniversary of the May Thirtieth Incident, Declaration on the Current Situation, Organizational Committee Circular, A Letter to the People on the Japanese Imperialist Invasion of Shanghai, A Letter to the People of the Whole Country on the Japanese Occupation of Shanghai Songhu, Shanghai East District Committee's Letter to the People on the Japanese Massacre in Shanghai, Beijing Special Committee's Recent Work Plan, Where is China Going, This is the Broad Road of the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Movement, The Situation After the Second Resolution of the League of Nations, and A Letter to Workers Commemorating May Day. The content of the above all used diplomacy to attack the National Government, so that the prestige of the National Government falls to the ground, unable to lead the masses, and should be led by farmers, workers, and the proletariat to organize armed insurrections, organize worker and peasant armies, establish Soviet political power, overthrow the National Government, dictatorship of the proletariat, and also want to overthrow capitalists, confiscate land, distribute it to poor peasants, and sabotage political and economic organizations, so it is undoubtedly harmful to the Republic of China. To summarize the defendant's claims, there are four stages: (1) organizing groups, (2) propaganda, (3) armed insurrection, (4) dictatorship of the proletariat. However, the defendant's behavior is in the second stage, and the third stage cannot be done now. To summarize what has been said, the defendant is guilty of Article 6 and Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(Peng Shuzhi) Peng Shuzhi's criminal circumstances are the same as Chen Duxiu's. He joined the Communist Party in Changsha in 1921, and was expelled due to internal divisions. In 1929, he formed the Left Opposition with Chen Duxiu and served as a Standing Committee member with the same powers as Chen. On October 15, 1932, he was arrested at Xie Shaoshan's home during the weekly Standing Committee meeting. He confessed to organizing the Left Opposition, and bears the same responsibility as Chen Duxiu in terms of propaganda. Therefore, the criminal articles cited are the same as Chen Duxiu.</p>
<p>(Wang Wu) Originally named Song Fengchun, he joined the Communist Party in 1925 and was responsible for propaganda work. Later, he was expelled due to differing opinions. Last May, using the pseudonym Liu Menggeng, he organized a Communist Party organization with Zheng Chaolin and was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, sentenced to six years in prison, and sent to the Jiangsu Second Prison to serve his sentence. He was released on bail due to illness on December 5 of last year, and arrested again on the 15th. He admitted the first part himself, but he did not admit the latter part, that is, he did not admit to attending meetings or being an alternate Standing Committee member. However, Xie Shaoshan confessed in the Second High Court that the five Standing Committee members were Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan, Luo Shifan, and Song Fengchun. Song was the fifth person. Fang was released from Caohejing Prison and participated in the meeting. This was the first time. He also confessed that Wang Wu was Song Fengchun. Also, when this office was investigating, it asked Chen Duxiu, and he said that there were five Standing Committee members, three official and two alternates. One was Pu Yifan, and the other was Luo Shifan, or Song Fengchun, he couldn't remember clearly. Also, Peng Shuzhi confessed that the alternates were Pu Yifan and Song Fengchun, so Wang Wu is an alternate Standing Committee member, and he is also a repeat offender, without doubt. He is guilty of Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(Pu Yifan) He was also arrested at Xie Shaoshan's house. He denied being a Communist Party member, but Xie Shaoshan confessed that he was an alternate Standing Committee member. Chen Duxiu also said that the first alternate Standing Committee member was Pu Yifan, and he couldn't remember the second. Peng Shuzhi also confessed that Pu was an alternate Standing Committee member. Now Chen and Peng both deny this statement. The reason for this is that Chen is the leader and is responsible for himself, but he wants to exonerate his subordinates. The article cited by the defendant is also Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(Wang Ziping) The defendant admitted to joining the Communist Party in 1927 and going to Russia in October of the same year. Later, he was expelled. According to his confession, he did not join the Trotskyist faction after being expelled. However, he printed the publications Spark and Campus Life. The Communist Party is very strict. If he did not join, how could he be asked to be responsible for printing? So he also joined and helped betray the country through propaganda without any doubt. The criminal articles cited are the same as Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi.</p>
<p>(He Afang) The defendant's criminal circumstances are the same as Wang Ziping's. The cited articles are also the same.</p>
<p>(Wang Zhaoqun) The defendant said that he was from South Suzhou. Because of the introduction of his friend Li Sichang, he was asked to go to Shanghai to find Xie Shaoshan for work, so he lived in Xie's home. Xie confessed in the Second High Court that his home was the central organization of the Trotskyist faction. If the defendant had no relationship with them, how could he be allowed to live there? Also, Lu Wenhu, a witness from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, testified that when they were arrested, they seemed to be in a meeting, each holding a pen and a notebook in their hands. Therefore, he is highly suspicious. Also, Lu testified that Wang Zhaoqun is Luo Shifan and is also one of the Standing Committee members. Also, Xie Shaoshan confessed in the Second High Court that all five Standing Committee members were arrested and no one escaped. From this, it can be seen that if the defendant is not a Standing Committee member, how could he attend the Standing Committee meeting? Therefore, Wang Zhaoqun is Luo Shifan and is the Standing Committee member, without a doubt. He is guilty of Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(Guo Jinghao) That is, Peng Daozhi. From the Communist Party School registration form, it can be seen that he is 23 years old, joined the Communist Party in Changsha in 1925, and joined the Trotskyist faction in 1929. He used to be engaged in the student movement and, after joining the Trotskyist faction, engaged in the East Shanghai District Committee and the student movement, which is also guilty of Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(Liang Youguang) He jumped out of the window at night when he was arrested. After being arrested, the Public Security Bureau found out that he was the Communist Party's Guangxi Inspector and had just returned from Guangxi. The place where he lived was Luo Shifan's home. Therefore, there is considerable evidence that the defendant is a Communist Party member. The criminal articles cited are the same as above.</p>
<p>(Wang Jiantang) Many reactionary documents were found in his home. His confessions were inconsistent before and after, and his name matched the name in the communication of the Communist Party Central Committee that was found. It is also clear that he is a Communist Party member. The criminal articles cited are the same as above.</p>
<p>The above has explained the evidence of the crimes of the defendants. Also, our court previously tried the Noulens case. Noulens was a Stalinist faction, which is directly related to the communist bandit riots in various provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Fujian, Guangdong, and Hunan. The defendants in this case have no relationship with it. The circumstances seem to be lighter. Please consider it when judging the court.</p>
<h3>Chen Duxiu's Defense</h3>
<p>After the prosecutor finished his argument, it was already 1:45 PM. The court immediately summoned Chen Duxiu to ask if he had any defense. Chen replied, of course, he had to defend himself. He then stated his reasons, saying briefly that the prosecutor's argument said that I endangered the Republic of China because I wanted to overthrow the Kuomintang and the National Government, but I only admit to opposing the Kuomintang and opposing the National Government, but I do not admit to endangering the Republic of China, because the government is not the country. Opposing the government is not endangering the country. For example, the Manchu government once claimed that the court was the country, and the Beiyang government also claimed to represent the country. However, Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, and others overthrew the Manchu government and overthrew the Beiyang government. If it is said that overthrowing the government is endangering the country, then isn't the Kuomintang already treason twice? But no one can admit this sentence, because the Manchu government and the Beiyang government cannot be regarded as the country at all. Therefore, in theory, our opposition to the Kuomintang and opposition to the National Government cannot be considered to endanger the Republic of China, etc. Secondly, Chen then restated his reasons for opposing the Kuomintang and the National Government in three points: (1) The people are not free, (2) Corrupt officials are rampant, (3) The government cannot thoroughly resist Japan, so it has to oppose it, etc. Then he stated his claims, saying that advocating the dictatorship of the proletariat and organizing the Soviet government does not endanger the Republic of China. He used the Soviet Union as proof of his career. The Soviet government is very strong, even the United States and Germany are not as good as it. The Chinese people now regard the word "Soviet" as a flood. This is the same situation as when people regarded the railway as a flood during the Tongzhi and Guangxu years. We are now spreading the organization of the Soviet government, and perhaps many people oppose it, and it is not approved by the law, but it cannot be said to be treason just because it is not approved, etc. Therefore, if the court makes a judgment on the people's political thought, it is not the people's court, but a religious court. Therefore, the prosecutor's accusation is fundamentally untenable and the court should declare him innocent, etc.</p>
<h3>Defense by Lawyer Zhang</h3>
<p>After Chen Duxiu's defense, his defense lawyer, Zhang Shizhao, immediately stood up to defend him, explaining from the aspects of speech and action that Chen had not betrayed the country. He also stated that Chen's attitude towards the Three Principles of the People was not one of irreconcilable opposition, and requested the court to declare Chen innocent. His speech was quite lengthy, lasting from 1:00 PM to 1:53 PM. The original text is recorded below: (This case should first address the distinction between speech and action. What is speech? In modern civilized countries, all advocate freedom of speech. Most of what is called freedom refers to the public sphere, as opposed to the private. The freedom of person A should be limited by not infringing upon the freedom of person B. Once it involves defamation, they are held responsible. However, it is different in the public sphere. When a party is in power, all its policies are subject to open public criticism throughout the country. Whether it is in parliament, newspapers, gatherings, books, or private discussions, no matter how harsh the criticism, as long as the motive is public and it is within the realm of politics, they all have the full right to express themselves. In private law, personal property is almost sacred. Any infringement is dealt with by laws and regulations. However, when it comes to political power, it is the opposite. Party A, in power, cannot regard its power as private property. Party B advocates attacking it, and also has methods to gain the public trust of the people. With a shift, the political power will be assumed by Party B. The phrase "seizing political power" does not contain any legal meaning. If the leader of Party A accuses Party B of the crime of seizing power, no court in the world would be able to handle such a case. The court's authority can only investigate and punish illegal emperors, but it cannot support a government that is reluctant to step down. This is the general principle of political struggles. The lawyer studied in England and was taught by the jurist Albert Venn Dicey, who said that in parliamentary re-elections, the majority of the two parties alternates. If the party in power refuses to step down, the opposition party has no legal recourse. If they appeal to the judge, the judge will be unable to do anything. However, since the establishment of constitutional government in England, the party in power has never been known to refuse to step down, all because the code of honor serves as the guiding principle. Therefore, when discussing the transfer of political power based on this principle, those who transfer it are never blamed, and those who receive it are never denounced. The coming and going are natural. This is the clear meaning of equilibrium and the grand principle of the constitution. Since the 18th century, the gradual prosperity of European and American countries has benefited from this principle. Anyone with some understanding can talk about it. As for the 20th century, which is called the Republic of China, if the people oppose the government but do not go beyond the scope of speech, and the court hastily imposes criminal penalties, it is difficult for colleagues to offer assistance, and upright people will disapprove. The atmosphere of a new country is so bleak, it is truly unbearable for the lawyer to describe. China, with its literary inquisitions by tyrannical rulers throughout history, is a matter of the past. In the dark ages of Europe, scholars who discussed politics were often exiled or killed. However, since the establishment of the Magna Carta in England, the term "opposition party" has stood firmly as a public term in politics. Human rights have been protected, and governance has been greatly facilitated. Other countries have followed suit, establishing constitutions, and thus forming the great flourishing of civil rights today. If one were to go to London or New York and ask a passerby whether opposing the government should be a crime, they would not think it was a madman's words, but would definitely consider it an insulting term. If the prosecutor's indictment in this case, (on one hand, coldly mocks and vehemently attacks the Kuomintang government, and in essence, it claims that the Kuomintang government's prestige is declining and it cannot lead the masses) and so on, all become important clauses for urgently punishing crimes, then comparing this between Chinese and foreigners, how different are the standards and how unclear are the lines between public and private? Taking a step back, if, as the indictment claims, there is indeed a crime, of the eleven articles of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, which article can be compared to it? The prosecutor uses "cold" to describe the mockery and "vehement" to describe the attack. What standard does the prosecutor use to determine the degree of high or low opposition? In short, opposing or attacking the government through speech is not a crime in any country. Even the special regulations of that country to deal with emergency situations do not contain such an explicit clause. What is discussed in this indictment is neither Chinese nor Western, neither common nor different, and is completely without basis. This is the first point that needs to be stated. Regarding "action," it refers to opposing or attacking the government. Further, overturning or subverting it is called "action." Actions can be divided into radical, legal, and violent, and therefore the legal meanings are different. What is legal? Such as legal elections. What is violent? Such as riots becoming revolutions. The effects on the government may be the same, but the former is called "overturning" and the latter is called "subverting." The names given are very different in law. Subversion is a crime, but overturning cannot be a crime. If it were a crime, the government of a constitutional country would never be able to change. How could it be possible? Article 103 of the Criminal Law on the crime of insurrection states, "(intending to subvert the government by illegal means...)" The implication is that any change of government by legal means is not at risk of violating criminal law. It is not difficult to understand the meaning from the text. The indictment accuses Chen Duxiu of overturning the Kuomintang government and establishing a proletarian dictatorship. If asked what means this overturning would take, in the previous court hearing, the presiding judge inquired about the National Assembly. Chen Duxiu replied that the Communist Party has the right to convene it themselves, and if the Nanjing National Government convenes it, the Communist Party will also participate. From Chen Duxiu's words, it is clear that his party is no different from ordinary political parties. How do ordinary political parties gain power? The Communist Party also follows the same path. This can be seen in the parliaments of various countries, where there are seats for the Communist Party. The Communist Party's constituencies compete for votes just like other parties. It can be seen that the Communist Party's primary means of political struggle is still nothing more than legally sanctioned voter voting. This is also Chen Duxiu's intention. Although the Kuomintang government promotes tutelage, tutelage has a term, similar to the term of the President of the United States. Sun Yat-sen often said that the world belongs to the public, and those who are virtuous and capable should be selected. There is no indication that the Kuomintang should permanently hold power, and there are no such provisions in official documents. Recently, the calls to open up political power have been even more prevalent. The period of tutelage is being shortened invisibly. The party's representative congress, which is held annually, is now discussing advancing the date for the purpose of returning power to the people. Under such circumstances, if someone plots to replace the Kuomintang and uses another type of political system to exercise the power that is being prepared to be returned, how can this be a crime? The presiding judge solemnly asked Chen Duxiu, "Is the Communist Party's ultimate goal to overthrow the Kuomintang and establish a Soviet regime?" He replied, "Of course, but it is not the ultimate goal." Although the word "overthrow" may sound unpleasant, if a British judge asked a member of the Conservative Party, "Is the Conservative Party's goal to overthrow the Liberal Party and establish a Baldwin cabinet?" There would be no other answer than "of course." To hastily charge it as a crime would be extremely comical. Or it may be said that what Chen Duxiu is talking about is violent rebellion. This is stated clearly in his testimony, not just once. Therefore, the indictment specifically points out that he should lead the workers and peasants, and the proletariat, etc., to organize an armed rebellion, organize worker-peasant armies, and establish a Soviet regime. Competing in elections is not a crime, but how can rebellion not be a crime? It should be discussed separately. Chen Duxiu's advocacy of rebellion is said to be the same strategy used by the Kuomintang when it overthrew the Northern Warlords. In the minds of ordinary people, it is far from murder and arson, and he only said "should" do this and that. Saying "should" is an ideal, not a fact, and it refers to the future, not the present. Article 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China takes "(the following actions)" as a necessary condition. "The following actions" refer to the current facts. It is acceptable to be violent but no more, but future ideals are not within the scope of this article. This is known even without deep knowledge. Duxiu only does not deny the rebellion, and repeatedly testified in court that he lacks the strength and has not taken any violent actions. The Communists in the Jiangxi area do not agree with their views, have never participated, and have never sent anyone to inspect. As for the formal Red Army, it will only be organized after gaining political power. This is not yet possible. The party's organization is completely independent, and the expenses are covered by party members saving on food and clothing. It does not receive any assistance from the Third International. Therefore, the talk of rebellion is just speculation and a necessary stage. It has no connection with the current security situation, and there is no so-called disturbance. The first law of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China and the national constitution are not affected in any way. How can the so-called disturbance (Article 103 of the Criminal Law on the crime of insurrection) be connected and forced into the scope of emergency insurrection? The lawyer is not intelligent and does not understand this. The law punishes the present and not the future. The Spring and Autumn Annals punish intentions. There is the principle of respecting the ruler and parents, not future intentions. The tyrannical Qin Emperor had a decree forbidding even criticism in the heart. One is a tradition of accepted teachings, and the other is despotic power. How different are these from the essential points of modern criminal law, which discovers the truth? Sun Yat-sen, whose portrait hangs in this court, also advocated communism. He specifically instructed to show to the public that "(the communism we advocate is communism for the future, not communism for the present)" (Lecture Two on the Principle of People's Livelihood). Therefore, within the communist theory held by Mr. Sun, there is thoroughness and no drawbacks. If future actions are to be subject to criminal sanctions, then the person who is first suspected of communism and subject to punishment may not be traceable by the court. If the state official can set fires, but the common people are not allowed to light lamps, then the equality of the law cannot be achieved. In summary, Chen Duxiu's advocacy of rebellion has not gone beyond the realm of speech or ideals. The meaning of the word "action" in the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes is completely different. Therefore, judging by actions, Duxiu has no reason to be convicted. This is the second point that needs to be stated. Furthermore, the charges cited in the indictment, one is treason, and the other is endangering the Republic of China. This court should be well aware of how to interpret the term "country." The country and the organs (i.e., the government) or figures in charge of the country are clearly different categories. Therefore, to hastily conclude that speech attacking the organs or figures endangers the country is logically untenable and legally improper. The country is the Republic of China. Sovereignty rests with the people, which is called the form of government. It must be something that greatly conflicts with the principle of the people, such as a movement to restore the monarchy, to be considered treason and endangering the country. Otherwise, no matter what criticisms are made of the government or any person or party in the government, to use criminal punishment as the only way out in the process of political management is only done in countries that inwardly cherish conspiracies and outwardly practice tyrannical politics, which are half-civilized. As far as the legal system is concerned, there is no such thing. Moreover, is not the reason why Duxiu has offended the government because he advocates communism? If this doctrine is viewed from the perspective of the judicial officer, is it not because it is incompatible with the Three Principles of the People? (The prosecutor filed charges under Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes). In fact, it is even more wrong. When Mr. Sun lectured on the Principle of People's Livelihood, he stated clearly at the beginning, "(The Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism, also known as communism, which is the Great Harmony)" (First paragraph of the first lecture). He explained the misunderstanding of his comrades, "(Many comrades, because they oppose the Communist Party, actually say that communism is different from the Three Principles of the People)" (Second lecture). He also said, "(The Principle of People's Livelihood is communism, is socialism, so we should not only say that it conflicts with the Principle of People's Livelihood, but also that it is a good friend)," and "(Kuomintang members, since they support the Three Principles of the People, should not oppose communism, because the great purpose of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to enable everyone to share property)" (Ibid). In summary, his explanation of the similarities, love, quality, and division between the Principle of People's Livelihood and communism is so clear. Now, Mr. Sun's lectures are recited throughout the country and regarded as treasures, while Chen Duxiu's magazines are now subject to criminal law and imprisoned. What could be more unjust in the world than this? Furthermore, the indictment points out that Duxiu "(overthrows capitalists, confiscates land, and distributes it to farmers. His words are inconsistent and clearly intend to destroy China's economic and political organization)." This can be found in Mr. Sun's book, and the response is as if hitting a drum, without the slightest deviation. The first lecture of the Principle of People's Livelihood states, "(The interests of capitalists and workers are always in conflict and cannot be reconciled, so wars arise. The best way to eliminate the merchants' monopoly is to socialize the distribution)." This is no different in quality or quantity from the above-mentioned words in the indictment. It is clearly stated that the fourth of the four major political programs of the Tongmenghui is equal land rights. Since it is called equalization, it should be called distribution. After distribution, there must be confiscation first. What is confiscation? It means taking it from the landlords. What is distribution? It means giving it to the poor farmers. The merchants' monopoly is eliminated, and the conflict between labor and capital is eliminated. How can China's traditional economic and political organizations not be destroyed? Citing Chen to prove Sun is like breathing through the same nostril. To say that these words are inconsistent, then there are big shots who say the same thing. It is also worth noting that Mr. Sun's policy of equal land rights has not yet been implemented. The reason for this is that the phrase "(share the future, not the present)" is enough to serve as an ironclad annotation. It is precisely because of this that Mr. Sun constantly reminded the public during his lifetime that the revolution has not yet succeeded, because the task of equal land rights must be accomplished by the power of revolution. Reason and situation are also not. Mr. Sun's revolution and Chen Duxiu's rebellion are a consistent theory. Mr. Sun's book is already recited by the people of the country, so even his revolutionary strategies are sincerely instructed to his comrades to work hard for. However, Chen Duxiu uses the word "rebellion," which has the same meaning, to seek the realization of the same core policy within the Principle of People's Livelihood. As soon as he opens his mouth, a trap arises. What should the faithful followers of Sun Yat-senism do? Moreover, judging from Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi's daily confessions, these two people cannot be regarded as communists who are consistent in word and deed. How can this be clarified? Duxiu does not admit to endangering the Republic of China, but admits to opposing the Kuomintang government. In summary, the reasons can be divided into three things: (1) Bayonet politics: The government uses its power to suppress the people's voices, preventing them from discussing anything. Not to mention that non-party members have no freedom of speech, even Kuomintang members without guns are prohibited from speaking out. (2) Exploitative means: All of the Kuomintang's policies are designed to create excessive taxes. The proceeds are deposited in foreign banks to allow imperialists to manipulate and control China. On the contrary, commerce is depressed, rural areas are bankrupt, and the national economy is a complete failure. (3) Lack of sincerity in resisting Japan: When the people's voices for resisting Japan were at their highest, the government allowed the isolated army to fight alone without providing assistance. Civil rights have been almost completely deprived, and nationalism cannot be maintained. Even private declarations to resist foreign aggression are increasingly offending the government. Peng Shuzhi's confession is roughly the same. These arguments are similar to the voices of ordinary people who are concerned about the current situation, departing from the Communist Party's standpoint. For example, the five southwestern provinces, Mr. Feng Yuxiang, and the Communist Party, who are completely unrelated, have recently criticized the government in documents and telegrams, which are widely published in newspapers in the north and south. They are also not far from the above three points. Supposing that our country's form of government had not changed and the imperial system was still in place, putting these matters in the memorial to the emperor written by a Han person discussing current affairs would not only avoid punishment but also receive praise. There are many such cases, which cannot be refuted. As for the remarks made by members of parliament in various countries to criticize the authorities, who only focus on their temporary eloquence, there are countless such examples. The only difference is that China is nominally a republic. Although Chen Peng's words are slightly more restrained, their opinions are the same. To list this as a crime and write it into the indictment, how can it be shown to future generations? The cases of Yu Qian and Xiong Tingbi in the Ming Dynasty were not limited to eunuchs when they were interrogated. On the day the cases were concluded, everyone believed that the criminals had been punished. However, once the political situation changes, the truth will be revealed. What is the public opinion now? It remains to be seen. Comparing the present with the past, the cases are the same. Moreover, regarding Chen Duxiu's relationship with the Kuomintang, although they are now separated, they initially cooperated. The presiding judge repeatedly asked Duxiu if he had held any positions in the Kuomintang. Duxiu firmly stated that he had not. In fact, this is not entirely true. He served as the Director of Education in Guangdong in 1921, which was the beginning of Sun Yat-sen's establishment of power in Guangdong. Moreover, his trip to Moscow in 1922 was the beginning of the Kuomintang's policy of allowing communists to join. The person who went with him is now the highest military officer in the country. Everyone can talk about it. What is even more important is that on April 5, 1927, Duxiu and the current President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, issued a joint declaration by the leaders of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, stating first that "(The Chinese Communist Party firmly recognizes that the Kuomintang and the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People are undoubtedly necessary in the Chinese revolution)" and also that "(Only those who do not want the Chinese revolution to move forward want to overthrow the Kuomintang and the Three Principles of the People. No matter how wrong the Chinese Communist Party is, it will not advocate overthrowing the Kuomintang, which is our enemy (imperialism and warlords) and which has always opposed the Three Principles of the People)." From this, it can be inferred that there are many people in the Communist Party who have mistaken views and advocate overthrowing the Kuomintang, but Duxiu persuades them with all his heart, showing his sincerity in his words and pleading with his comrades not to "(be resented by their relatives and rejoiced by their enemies)." This point alone is more than enough to create a division within the Communist Party. The presiding judge resolutely asked Duxiu why he became an opponent of the Soviet Russian cadres (i.e., the Stalin faction). Duxiu replied that it was because of differences in opinion. When asked what those opinions were, he sadly did not answer and asked the presiding judge not to ask further about party matters, so as not to make him appear to be acting as a detective himself. His sorrowful feelings were truly overflowing in his words. Duxiu's expulsion from the party and the displeasure of the Moscow cadres with the declaration jointly issued with Wang Jingwei are undoubtedly traces of a snake in the ashes and a cause and effect relationship. An insightful person can easily see this at a glance. Although he did not say it, it should be taken as evidence by the court. At that time, allowing communists to join was the Kuomintang's public policy. All communists were also members of the Kuomintang at the same time. Conversely, many Kuomintang members were also communists at the same time. Chen Duxiu was one of the people in the great unification. His position was no different from that of the current Kuomintang leaders. After the purge of communists, although Duxiu did not further cooperate with the Kuomintang and fight alongside them, because he was expelled by the cadres, his position happened to be the enemy of the Kuomintang's foremost enemy. Unintentionally, he became a buffer. Even from the perspective of the Communist Party, one more Trotskyist means one less Stalinist. One less Stalinist means one less member of the Jiangxi Red Army. In this way, they indirectly help each other. To say that the Trotskyists and the Kuomintang are taking a conflicting stance to purge the communists is not impossible. Even based on this, if we discuss merits and demerits, to say that the Trotskyists have contributed to the Kuomintang is not enough. Why would there be a crime? Duxiu will certainly not admit this himself, but if the court does not pay attention to this when judging this case, the evidentiary methods will not be fully prepared, and the ruling will not be considered fair. In short, Chen Duxiu's inability to take the same stance as the Kuomintang is due to the situation. His loyalty to his doctrine and his continued research on communist theory are due to reason. He will implement his plans in the future, which has nothing to do with the Jiangxi Red Army or the Third International. Calling himself a Trotskyist is no different from a biologist worshiping Darwin or a psychologist worshiping Freud. This is also the legacy of Sun Yat-sen. Kuomintang members should also follow it. Why should others be criticized for criticizing the Kuomintang's mistakes and shortcomings? This is the duty of the people. Even if he is not a communist, he can do it out of loyalty and righteousness. The government currently restricts freedom of speech and deliberately enforces strict measures. If the three things Chen Duxiu stated are not suitable for public dissemination, then the government has the Publication Law and should treat all newspapers and magazines equally. It should not be biased. If what he said is correct, the government should be ashamed and unable to thank him enough. Why is there a crime? If what he said is incorrect, then it should be listed as a lesson for those who hear it. It should not be punished. Must detectives be sent out everywhere, as if facing a great enemy? If there is any connection, a heavy punishment is imposed. Is this the purpose of the state's legislation? Based on the above arguments, the prosecutor's citations of Article 2 and Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China in the Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi parts of this case, the so-called treason, endangering the Republic of China, and advocating doctrines that are inconsistent with the Three Principles of the People are completely unfounded. May the presiding judge make a judgment based on the law, find them not guilty, protect the seeds of scholars, respect freedom of speech, adhere to the spirit of the law, and release the innocent from their shackles. This is both a public virtue and a convenience. Respectfully submitted,</p>
<h3>Supplementation by Lawyer Peng and Others</h3>
<p>After Lawyer Zhang finished stating his defense reasons, lawyers Peng Wangyan and Wu Zhiping also defended Chen. Peng stated that regarding Chen Duxiu's part, the prosecutor cited Article 2 and Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China to determine that Chen was guilty. However, the first sentence of each of these articles contains the phrase "(for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China)." This phrase should be given special attention. The country and the government cannot be confused. The elements of a country are land, people, and sovereignty. If Chen is truly endangering the country, then he should be harming the country's land, people, or sovereignty to have a basis. However, Chen's actions, first, do not harm the country's land. The loss of our country's land today cannot be attributed to Chen in the slightest. That is the first point. Second, Chen advocates the dictatorship of the working class and peasants, which is aimed at the majority of the people and aims to improve the lives of this majority of the people. It is clear that he is not harming the people. That is the second point. Furthermore, in terms of sovereignty, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Constitution during the period of tutelage states that the sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to all the citizens of the Republic of China. Chen and others are Chinese citizens and are only advocating their theories and doctrines, which is not contrary to sovereignty. Please clarify this with an example. The country is like a company, the government is the board of directors, and the people are the shareholders. If the shareholders are not satisfied with the board of directors or the manager produced by the board of directors and seek to reorganize the board of directors, it is definitely not harming the company. Using this example for Chen's actions, it is very clear that he is not endangering the Republic of China. Furthermore, Article 103 of the Criminal Law on the crime of insurrection states that intending to subvert the government by illegal means constitutes a crime. Chen Duxiu is seeking to overthrow the current government through legal procedures, which does not comply with the provisions of that article. As for his research on doctrines and theories and the publication of small pamphlets such as "Spark" and "Campus Life," they cannot be regarded as treasonous propaganda. Secondly, regarding the organization and assembly, their purpose is not to endanger the Republic of China. Then, lawyer Wu Zhiping supplemented, briefly stating that all actions constituting a crime must be based on the elements of the action. Even if there is an action, whether the action endangers the Republic of China is also to be studied. Regarding Chen's facts in this case, Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China cannot be cited. As for Article 6 of that law, which refers to organizing and assembling for treasonous propaganda, the publications issued by Chen and others were all found in Xie Shaoshan's home and have not yet been published in society, so they are not responsible for propaganda. Therefore, their crimes cannot be constituted. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Soldiers of the water patrol team collude with bandits. The boat team of the Third Public Security District of Suzhou Water Police has always been stationed in various villages. Yesterday (the 21st), eight soldiers from the Second Squad of the Eleventh Team stationed in Xiangcheng colluded with lake bandits in Yangcheng Lake and suddenly escaped with their weapons. Captain Wang of the Eleventh Team heard the news in Suzhou and has already launched an investigation in the villages.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>County Government Decides to Subsidize Sericulture</p>
<p>Wuxi County Magistrate Yan, previously received an order from the Second District Administrative Inspector's Office stating that various counties in this district have historically been the richest in sericulture production. Two specific measures were outlined: (1) Farmers engaged in sericulture should be provided with low-interest loans for capital. (2) A maximum price for spring cocoons should be predetermined and announced to farmers to encourage their enthusiasm and instructed them to make sericulture arrangements in advance. Therefore, a sericulture relief conference was convened yesterday, gathering representatives from the Cocoon Industry Association, Sericulture Guidance Center, Chamber of Commerce, and Farmers' Bank. The following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the low-interest loan for sericulture capital, it was decided to change this to issuing bonuses, with a total amount of 5,000 yuan. A request will be submitted to the Department of Construction to use funds from the agricultural budget. Sericulture farmers with excellent results will be awarded accordingly. Shen Xichun from the Sericulture Guidance Center was appointed to draft the plan, which will be submitted to the county government for approval and announcement. (2) The Sericulture Guidance Center will dispatch personnel to various townships to provide guidance and publicity, departing before the 27th. In addition to guiding sericulture, they should also focus on publicity and encouragement. Outstanding results should be reported to the county government promptly. After the conclusion and statistics, awards will be given. (3) Regarding the issue of predetermining the maximum cocoon price, traditionally, the Cocoon Industry Association must convene a general meeting of members when the cocoon market opens to determine the price based on the silk market. It is extremely difficult to predetermine the price.</p>

<p>Strange Beast Discovered in Anjiasha</p>
<p>Recently, a strange beast has been discovered near Anjiasha in the 17th district of Wuyi County. It resembles a horse with a pig's head, and it is as large as a yellow cow. It roams around at night, foraging for food. It bites people it encounters. More than ten single pedestrians and homeless beggars in the area have been harmed. Nearby residents are on alert at night and dare not go out. Yesterday, armed militia members went to shoot it with live ammunition, but they failed to cause any harm. The matter has spread far and wide, and everyone is amazed.</p>

<p>Order to Return the Property of the Sheng Family Pawnshop</p>
<p>Eighteen Years Ago</p>
<p>During the tenure of former County Magistrate Shen, the provincial order was followed to investigate the Sheng family's estate, Jimei, Junda. Pawnshops and properties were investigated, with a capital of approximately 13,000 yuan. The estate was seized and impounded. It has now been found that the Yuchan Village Charity Fund has been cleared in accordance with the instructions. The 18th resolution of the Executive Yuan ordered the province to instruct the Changshu, Jiading, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Yizheng county governments to release the impoundment of the pawnshops established by the Sheng family.

<p>Designating Thirteen County Party Headquarters to Improve Organization and Activities</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee, in order to improve the organization and activities of county party headquarters, drafted implementation measures for improving the organization and activities of party headquarters below the county and city levels and submitted them to the Central Committee for review and record. Subsequently, a letter was received from the Central Organization Committee, stating that the proposed implementation measures were generally acceptable and approved for record. However, it was suggested to first select several county party headquarters with a relatively large number of party members, sound party principles at all levels, or special circumstances as implementation areas. It was stipulated that responsible personnel from the county party headquarters to be prepared for implementation should be convened within two weeks to provide detailed instructions, and the designated county party headquarters should be required to complete the organizational improvement work within three months. The Provincial Executive Committee immediately followed this instruction and, in the 19th committee meeting held the other day, decided to select Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Qidong, Wujiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Shangdun, Lishui, Jiangdu, Taixian, Fengxian, and eleven other counties as implementation areas for improving the organization and activities of lower-level party headquarters, and notified all counties accordingly. It is learned that in addition to notifying all counties, the Provincial Executive Committee has scheduled a meeting with the standing committee members of the thirteen county party headquarters designated for implementation, such as Jiangning, at the provincial party headquarters at 10:00 AM on May 10 to provide detailed instructions on the implementation guidelines for the improvement work.</p>
<h3>Business Tax Collection Still Prospering</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Business Tax Bureau is very serious about tax collection. Last winter, it had already collected 90% of the taxes. For the remaining indebted households, staff have been dispatched to sit and collect. In Zhenjiang, the business tax for the spring of this year, from last month to now, has already collected 50% to 60% (approximately 20,000 yuan can be collected each quarter). For sporadic indebted households, staff have been dispatched to strictly pursue the unpaid taxes, and it is expected that the full amount will be collected soon. As for Yangzhou Zhong (approximately 700 yuan can be collected each quarter), staff have also been dispatched to urge collection.</p>

<p>Cao Deqing, the police chief of the Second Police Station of the Sixth Public Security Bureau in Jiangdong, Ningbo, went to the Ningdong Creek Steamboat Company pier at Dahetou at 6:30 AM yesterday to inspect passengers. He saw a passenger named Chen Qifa, carrying a paper package, looking flustered, and hurriedly disembarking. The police officer suspected his behavior and searched him. Inside the paper package, there were eleven boxes of small foreign goods, each box containing 1,000 red pills, totaling 11,000 pills. The police officer suspected that he was trafficking drugs and brought the person and the goods to the bureau to be handed over to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Buried Infant Revives, Family Reunites</h3>
<p>Lu Xiaoyu, a resident of Chenchao Township in the Second District of Xiangshan, is currently the manager of Shenchang Nanhang in Dinghai. He is of advanced age and has no children.

Mother and son took a boat back to Dinghai overnight. Unexpectedly, Zhulin died on the way. After arriving in Dinghai, Lu hired a handyman named Gu Achun to bury the child. Unexpectedly, when the handyman arrived at the burial site, the child revived. The handyman then took the child home and raised him. It has been over a year now, and Lu has not yet known about it. Now, because of a quarrel between the handyman Gu and a neighbor, the neighbor ran to tell Lu. Lu went to see the child and found that he was indeed his son. He was overjoyed. Lu paid Gu 140 yuan as compensation for raising the child and took Zhulin back. The family was reunited.</p>

<h3>National Chinese Cotton Mills to Reduce Working Hours Starting Today</h3>
<p>Provisionally Set for One Month, Reducing Working Hours by 23%</p>
<p>Central Government Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Inquire and Find Ways to Provide Relief</p>
<p>The National Chinese Cotton Mills Association, due to the recent poor sales of Chinese cotton yarn, which has been affected by the dumping of foreign cotton yarn, has reached a desperate situation. Therefore, a unanimous resolution was made to reduce working hours by 23% in all cotton mills nationwide, starting today, for a period of one month. Upon hearing the news, the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Industry sent special personnel to Shanghai to investigate the truth. A meeting with representatives of the association was convened at the city government yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>National Cotton Mills to Reduce Working Hours Today</h3>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, there are over 80 Chinese cotton mills nationwide, with approximately 2.5 million spindles. Shanghai accounts for three-tenths of the total, with 28 mills. However, recently, Yongyu, Tongchang, and Longmao have ceased operations, so the actual number is 25. After the Cotton Mills Association decided to reduce working hours, those participating account for eight-tenths of the national total, with 2 million spindles. In Shanghai, except for Jingwei and Chongxin, which are not members and did not join, all the remaining mills will uniformly reduce working hours by 23% starting today. That is, all day and night shifts will be suspended on Saturdays and Sundays. However, this is only provisional for one month. If the market improves slightly by then, the original state will be restored; otherwise, a meeting will be held to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cotton Mills Association Issues Notice</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mills Association issued a notice stating that due to sluggish sales of cotton yarn and cloth, the inventory of each mill is increasing daily, and market prices are declining. The operation of cotton mills is becoming increasingly difficult. After a meeting of all mills was convened on April 10, it was resolved that from April 21 to May 21, each mill will suspend day and night shifts on Saturdays and Sundays to reduce production and maintain survival. This information has been reported to the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Workers' Losses Not Significant</h3>
<p>A reporter from Guomin News Agency interviewed the person in charge of the association yesterday, who said that the current reduction in working hours in Chinese cotton mills nationwide is indeed an unfortunate event. However, in this time of global economic panic, it is not unique to our country and is also a last resort. If the cotton mills disregarded their inventory and continued to produce desperately, they would eventually go bankrupt. Although working hours have been reduced, the losses suffered by the workers are minimal. Nominally, three shifts are reduced each week (the Sunday shift is already suspended), but in reality, each worker only loses one shift. Over a month, it is only four shifts. At a wage of 6 jiao per shift, it is only a reduction of 2 yuan per month. Therefore, the losses suffered by the workers cannot be considered significant.</p>
<h3>Central Government Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Investigate</h3>
<p>After receiving the report from the Chinese Cotton Mills Association, the Central Party Headquarters, considering the reduction in working hours by the cotton mills to be a major issue, sent Section Chief Wu Zhongheng to Shanghai to negotiate relief measures with the local government and party headquarters. Upon receiving the report, the Ministry of Industry also sent Industry Division Chief Liu Yinfei to Shanghai. They are currently in Shanghai discussing solutions. As for the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, it had already dispatched personnel with the party headquarters to ascertain the truth and reported it to the municipal government for review.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Discusses Relief Measures Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, a meeting was held at the municipal government to discuss relief measures. Attendees included Section Chief Wu Zhongheng of the Central Party Headquarters' People's Movement Committee, Division Chief Liu Yinfei of the Ministry of Industry, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government, Director Wu Huanru of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Wang Gang of the Workers' Welfare Section, Director Qin Hongji of the Industry Section, Secretary-General Jiang Huai of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, Rong Zongjing of Xinchang Cotton Mill, Nie Lusheng of Hengfeng Cotton Mill, Guo Shun of Wing On Cotton Mill, and Zhang Zemin of the Association. The meeting did not adjourn until 12:00 PM. Although compromise measures were proposed, further discussion and careful consideration are still needed to seek a solution that takes into account both parties' interests. However, the suspension of work by the Chinese cotton mills will still be implemented starting today.</p>
<h3>Wei Jingzhou Discusses the Central Mint</h3>
<p>Changing Models, Free Minting, Increasing Production</p>
<p>The Central Mint has been in operation for two months. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the Deputy Director of the Mint, Mr. Wei Jingzhou, yesterday to inquire about the latest facilities of the mint. He was granted an audience and provided a detailed response.</p>
<h3>New Coin Model Change</h3>
<p>According to Deputy Director Wei, the original model of the new coin had the portrait of the Premier on the front and a sailboat on the back. Above the sailboat, there were the six characters "(Gold Standard Coin One Yuan)". Below the sailboat, there were three birds flying above the water. Later, the proposal to change our country's silver standard to the gold standard was shelved. Therefore, the four characters "(Gold Standard Coin)" were removed, leaving only the two characters "(One Yuan)". The three birds were moved above the sailboat, flying in the air. Next to the sailboat, a silhouette of the rising sun was added. This is the model of the new coin currently being produced. Now, because this model has been misunderstood by the general public, it has been decided to remove the silhouette of the rising sun. A new model has been ordered from the United States and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of next month.</p>
<h3>Daily Production Increase</h3>
<p>The workers at the Central Mint were originally novices and are currently still in training. Therefore, the daily production of new coins is very small. However, the workers are improving very quickly. The daily increase is now approximately 10,000 yuan. Yesterday (the 20th), a total of 55,000 yuan in coins was produced. Today (the 21st), the production is expected to increase to approximately 65,000 yuan. We hope that in the future, working ten hours a day, the output will be 220,000 to 250,000 yuan. As for subsidiary coins, orders have not yet been received from the ministry to mint them.</p>
<h3>Implementing Free Minting</h3>
<p>The Central Mint has now received an order from the ministry to implement free minting. If the people hand over raw silver to the mint, the mint can collect the appropriate minting fee and mint silver coins on their behalf in accordance with the Silver Standard Coin Regulations. Currently, the Bank of China has sent raw silver to be minted into new coins. As for the more than 70 million yuan of new coins produced by the Central Mint since it opened, they have been sent to the Central Bank as a reserve fund, as instructed by Minister Song.</p>
<h3>Organizing an Audit Committee</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is now organizing an audit committee to supervise the weight and fineness of the new coins produced by the mint. The number of committee members has been set at twenty-one. In addition to the Director of the Monetary Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Director of the Central Mint being ex officio members, twelve Chinese bankers and seven foreign bankers will be invited to be members. Currently, preparations are still underway, and it is expected to be formally established in the near future.</p>
<h3>Change of New and Old Staff</h3>
<p>Mr. Hickey, the Chief Technician of the Central Mint, has resigned and returned to the United States for retirement due to old age and weakness. Mr. Grant, the former Director of the US Philadelphia Mint, has been hired to succeed him. Mr. Grant is scheduled to come to China in mid-month to take office. There is also a secretary. As for Wang, the Director of the Audit Department, the previous approval for the resignation of former Director Guo has been received. Director Lu has appointed Wang Jun and Wei Tingfen to succeed him.</p>
<h3>Defengxiang Foreign Goods Store Bombed Last Night, Wounding People</h3>
<p>Clerk Wang Shaolan Wounded in the Face</p>
<p>Defengxiang Foreign Goods Store, located at 315 Medina Road, next to the Grand Clock Tower in the French Concession, is opened by local tycoon Fei Zairong. At 7:30 PM last night, someone threw a hand-held bomb at the store's glass window. The explosion was swift and loud. However, at the time, the store clerks were all having dinner in the back hall, leaving only a few staff members to guard the store. The clerk Wang Shaolan (from Haiyan, 27 years old) was wounded in the face. He was taken to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. Due to the minor injuries, he was discharged after bandaging. Four display windows were completely destroyed by the explosion. The Grand Clock Tower Police Station dispatched detectives upon hearing the news, investigated the situation, and reported back to the head of the police station.</p>
<h3>Letter Requesting Elimination of Unstable Forces</h3>
<p>Japanese Citizen Acts Unreasonably, Attempted Murder</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association Requests the Municipal Council to Cancel His Gun License</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession yesterday, stating: "According to a letter from Ding Jintao, 'I, Ding Jintao, reside at 164 Tongji Road, Zhabei, and work as a chauffeur. On April 15, at 4:00 PM, I drove my car to the intersection of Wusong Road and Changan Lane in the Hongkou Public Concession for business. At that time, a Japanese citizen named Kawaguchi Saburo, residing at 112 Xiaoshadu Road, drove his own car and parked next to my car. He shouted loudly in English and gestured for me to move my car. Therefore, Jintao moved the car back a few steps. However, the Japanese citizen Kawaguchi Saburo suddenly jumped out of his car, opened my car door, and without asking for any reason, began to punch and kick me in the face. At that time, Jintao was inside the car and was insulted unexpectedly. He quickly used both hands to stop his violent behavior. The Japanese citizen Kawaguchi was still not satisfied and took out a pistol and made a shooting gesture with live ammunition. In this extremely critical situation, a Chinese patrol officer No. 553 from the concession happened to pass by and stepped forward to stop him. Fortunately, no shot was fired. However, the Chinese patrol officer, seeing that the would-be murderer was Japanese, could not arrest him and allowed him to escape. Therefore, Jintao and the Chinese patrol officer went to the Hongkou Police Station to file a complaint. The Chinese patrol officer also testified. A short while later, the police station notified the Japanese Consulate to escort the suspect Kawaguchi to the Hongkou Police Station. As a result of the interrogation, Kawaguchi admitted to the assault and the fact that he had a pistol and attempted murder, and stated that his pistol was licensed by the British Concession Municipal Council. The police station authorities believed that Japanese citizens could not be tried and had no choice but to allow him to leave freely and arrogantly. Jintao could not bear the insult and went to the Japanese Consulate to file a complaint. In this case, the police officer sided with the suspect and forced the victim to leave. I am now reporting the entire incident to your association and requesting that the Public Concession Municipal Council of the Shanghai Concession cancel the pistol license of the suspect Kawaguchi Saburo to prevent the abuse of power by Japanese citizens who arbitrarily commit assaults and murders.' Upon investigation, the association believes that the violent actions of the Japanese citizen Kawaguchi are likely to be true, as the Chinese patrol officer No. 553 can be questioned. However, according to the judgments of self-awareness and the court, your bureau has absolute power to maintain law and order. However, in the face of this Japanese citizen, you did not arrest him and allowed him to escape, and he held a pistol license, allowing him to abuse his power at will. The association believes that it is extremely regrettable that the aforementioned powers of your bureau are so weak. In light of the foregoing, we respectfully request that your bureau promptly take action and follow the spirit of dealing with the child's bridge incident by Japanese troops on Nanjing Road last year to eliminate this unstable force."</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Luggage Arrived Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the news of Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Mr. Bogomolov's arrival in China. According to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Bogomolov and others departed from Kobe on the Asia Empress steamer yesterday and are expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dispatched Section Chief Zhao Tiecheng and Zhang Mengling, the Municipal Government has dispatched Secretary Tang Shixuan, and the Russian community will all be at the port to welcome him. Ambassador Bogomolov's luggage and other items arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday on the Russian steamer Lodezhsky. After Ambassador Bogomolov arrives in Shanghai tomorrow, he will rest briefly and then proceed to Beijing to present his credentials and will be stationed between Beijing and Shanghai on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Sino-Belgian Treaty to Be Revised</h3>
<p>Belgian Envoy to Travel South at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo Begins Negotiations</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Belgian Consulate announced yesterday that Belgian Envoy Giyu Mou has traveled north to Ping after submitting his credentials in Beijing a few days ago to inspect overseas Chinese affairs and has had talks with the North China authorities. Now that the mission to the north is coming to an end, he is scheduled to travel south from Ping at the end of the month. When passing through Beijing, he plans to visit Foreign Minister Luo Wengan to discuss the revision of the Sino-Belgian Treaty. The Sino-Belgian Treaty was signed in 1865, and there is now a real need for revision. As for the abandonment of extraterritorial rights by Belgium, there is no strong indication of insistence. If countries such as Britain, the United States, and France can abandon them, Belgium will have no problem. The total number of Belgian overseas Chinese in Shanghai is over one hundred, and their feelings towards our country are very good.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government to Implement Factory Inspections in the Special Zone in the Short Term</h3>
<p>Without Being Obstructed or Stopped</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Issued a Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the inspection of factories in the concession, the Taxpayers' Annual Meeting passed an amendment to Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations on the 19th of this month. Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a speech the day before yesterday, expressing that our government will never give up this sovereignty. According to Tian Heqing, Director of the Factory Inspection Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to implement the Labor Law Factory Inspection Regulations, our authorities will not stop the inspection in the special zone due to any obstruction. The municipal government is currently deliberating on the method of inspection and will be implemented in the short term.</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Municipal Party Headquarters, in opposition to the decision of the Special Council of Foreign Ratepayers to amend Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations in an attempt to seize the right to factory inspection, issued the following declaration yesterday: "(Factory inspection is an urgent task for industrial society. Developed countries have successively implemented it. Our country has also paid close attention to this since the promulgation of the Factory Law and Factory Inspection Law. The Ministry of Industry has also opened a training institute for factory inspectors to train specialized personnel for this purpose and distribute them to various places to implement inspections. However, the Municipal Council of the Public Concession in Shanghai has unreasonably obstructed and hindered it, causing various factories to lack guidance and accidents to occur from time to time. Recently, the bureau has intensified its efforts, and the Special Council of Foreign Ratepayers has decided to amend the Yangjingbang Regulations to seize the right to factory inspection and attempt to deprive Chinese citizens of the freedom to open factories and operate industries in the concession through licensing. The illegal and infringing act of the Municipal Council and the foreign ratepayers is something that this association will oppose to the extreme. The concession is our country's territory, and the Municipal Council has no right to prevent our government from implementing its national laws within its territory. Furthermore, factory inspection is a type of social legislation and is closely related to a country's national spirit and industrial policy. Even from the perspective of legal system and interests, this power should not be given to foreigners to allow them to destroy our country's national spirit and industrial policy. This is the reason why Judge Fei said that Chinese citizens must not allow the Municipal Council to independently exercise this management right. Now, the Municipal Council and a part of the foreign ratepayers want to seize the major power related to our country's national policy with the simplest licensing method and want to expand their power to restrict the freedom of Chinese citizens to open factories and operate industries in their own country's territory. Their methods are extremely cunning, and their intentions are extremely vicious. If our country recognizes this illegal and infringing act, will our citizens still have the possibility of freely operating industries in the concession in the future? This association would also like to add that the concession is our country's territory, nineteen of the residents are our country's people, and most of the tax revenue is also obtained from Chinese citizens. However, the legislative power of the concession is completely controlled by the three thousand foreign ratepayers, while Chinese citizens are in a position of being ruled. How unfair is this? How dangerous is this? Therefore, in addition to opposing the concession authorities' seizure of the right to factory licensing and factory inspection, this association specifically raises the issue of the concession's legislative power to arouse the attention of our compatriots in this city." (Omitted below) Declaration of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Ma Xiangbo and Others Petition the Post-War Rehabilitation Association to Survey and Determine the Construction of a Dam at Tianyaoqiao</h3>
<p>Never Open to Prevent Sewage and Benefit People's Livelihood</p>
<p>The Puhuitang Dredging Promotion Committee Meeting Decided Yesterday</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo, a 94-year-old man, convened a meeting of the members of the Puhuitang Dredging Promotion Committee and the local gentry along the canal at Leshantang, Tushanwan, at 2:00 PM on the 20th. Those present included Gu Rungui, Yang Fuyuan, Wang Rujue, Wu Yuqing, Wang Shenxian, Tang Puzhuang, Pan Boxian from Shanghai, Li Wenlai and Shen Caigeng from Songjiang, Li Qixian, Gu Junjie, Li Youxian, Hu Sigai, Xia Rusheng, Wang Daohang, Jin Qiancheng, Yang Xueqiao, Wang Jingzhi from Qingpu, and dozens of others. Chairman Ma Xiangbo reported, stating that the Puhuitang has been silted up for a long time, and sewage is pouring in, which is harmful to hygiene. Last autumn, he initiated the dredging and reported to the Songhu War Zone Post-War Rehabilitation Association for funds and work and requested the Executive Yuan to intercept the flow of the dam at Tianyaoqiao in the eastern section for the clean drinking water of the residents along the canal and change the inlet from Longhua Port, through Caohijing, to Puhuitang to avoid sewage pouring in and benefit people's livelihood. Now, the Shanghai section has already started work in order, but the dam at Tianyaoqiao has not been built at the originally planned location. He believes that if the dam is not intercepted, the river water and drainage water from various factories will still have to pour in, and the hundreds of thousands of lives along the canal will be forever in the sea of suffering and killed by poisonous water. All the members were indignant upon hearing this. Then, Committee Member Yang Fuyuan reported that he had been summoned by the Post-War Rehabilitation Association to survey the dam base a few days ago and determined the location at the bottom of Tianyaoqiao with Secretary-General Wu Hengzhong. It is difficult to clearly understand whether the Engineering Bureau is handling it according to the original plan. Then, Li Youxian and Wang Rujue successively reported that the dam on the east side of Damuqiao is large and solid, while the dam on the west side of Tianyaoqiao is low and narrow. Judging from the situation, it seems that the dam east of Damuqiao is the intercepting dam, but there are many factories west of Damuqiao. If it is cut off there, it will still be difficult to avoid the westward flow of sewage. After discussion, it was decided that Ma Lao should take the lead in petitioning the National Government Songhu War Zone Post-War Rehabilitation Association and inform the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Bureau to build a dam at the bottom of Tianyaoqiao in accordance with the survey, never open it, to curb sewage and benefit people's livelihood; otherwise, they would fight to the death and would not stop until the goal was achieved. After the meeting, a group photo was taken to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Urges Yang Jie to Return to Head the Army University</h3>
<p>All the Students of the Army University Also Wired to Persuade Him</p>
<p>Since Yang Jie, the president of the Army University, resigned from all his positions and came to Shanghai to recuperate, he has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from various parties urging him to stay, but he has firmly declined. The telegrams from Chiang Kai-shek and all the students of the Army University are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram from Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Military Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram to Yang Gengguang: To Yang Gengguang, Principal of the Army University, respectfully: Your message of巧电 (Qiaodian - an archaic form of telegram) received and understood. Secret message, Geng Mi. Your management of the Army University has produced outstanding results. I have already telegraphed the central government to issue your reappointment order immediately. I sincerely hope you will return to the university to preside over affairs, utilizing your expertise. This is the fundamental work for strengthening the national army. Saving the nation and wiping out humiliation depends entirely on this. Since your respected mother is being cared for in Shanghai, you can readily attend to her nearby at any time. It seems there is no need for a separate leave of absence. Zhongzheng, 哿 (an archaic closing salutation).</p>
<h3>Telegram from Army University Students</h3>
<p>Also, a telegram from all the students of the Army University: To Yang Jun, Principal of the Army University, respectfully: Since your esteemed self took over the management of our school, you have vigorously rectified it, and it has improved daily. We have all bathed in the spring breeze and benefited from your transformative rain. We students, while receiving military instruction, secretly celebrate our good fortune. However, we heard that your esteemed self previously resigned and departed due to compelling matters. Upon hearing this news, we felt as if we had lost our support. We telegraphed the central government, appealing for them to retain you. Fortunately, they heeded our request. However, your esteemed self is still remaining in Shanghai due to illness.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>You have repeatedly and firmly declined, exhibiting a lofty and detached spirit, and a character of unwavering integrity. However, considering that we are currently facing strong neighbors invading our territory and the nation is in deep crisis, our school bears the significant responsibility of researching national defense. Saving the nation through academics depends entirely on your esteemed self's earnest instruction. The promotion of school affairs also relies heavily on your esteemed self's meticulous planning. While your esteemed self may be able to leave the school, the school cannot be without your esteemed self for even a day. We eagerly await you in Shanghai, and our collective hearts are filled with anxiety. Therefore, we are sending this special telegram to express our feelings. We earnestly implore you to love the nation with the same love you have for yourself, and to love the school with the same love you have for the nation. Please return to the school as soon as possible so that we students can have guidance in discussing military strategy and pursuing academic studies. If this happens, the school will be extremely fortunate, and the nation will be extremely fortunate. On the verge of sending this telegram, we are filled with endless and urgent anticipation as we await your orders. Dai Gaoxiang, Duty Officer of the Tenth Class of the Army University; Wang Zhuofan, Duty Officer of the Eleventh Class; respectfully kowtow, together with all students of both classes.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Adds Round-Trip Tickets for Beijing-Wuxi and Shanghai-Wuxi Starting Today</h3>
<p>Fares calculated at 75% of the original price. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations previously only issued round-trip tickets from Nanjing and Hangzhou. Recently, Zhenjiang became the capital of Jiangsu Province, so round-trip tickets were specially added. Since Wuxi has more passengers than Zhenjiang, the people of Wuxi requested the two Railway Administrations to follow the example of Zhenjiang and add round-trip tickets. This was also approved by the two Railway Administrations, and they were added starting on the 21st. Anyone traveling between Beijing and Wuxi or Shanghai and Wuxi can purchase round-trip tickets, which are a quarter cheaper than the original price. The validity period is one week.</p>
<h3>Three Provinces' Salt Fields No Longer Issue Ministry Licenses</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, considering the financial difficulties of various provinces, and that provincial enterprises often face difficulties in development due to funding shortages, specially requested and received approval from the Executive Yuan to transfer the management of the state-owned salt fields to the provincial governments in order to promote balanced national and local development. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have already taken over the respective fields. It is now reported that the Ministry of Finance believes that since the affairs of the state-owned salt fields have been directly handled by the provincial governments, the continued use of ministry licenses would be ambiguous and might easily cause misunderstandings among the people who are unaware of the truth. Yesterday, the ministry specially telegraphed the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, stating that the licenses used in the future should be printed and issued by the provincial governments and that ministry licenses will no longer be used. The number of ministry licenses kept in stock will be sent to the ministry for cancellation.</p>
<h3>After Japan Occupies Luandong, U.S. Warships Change Deployment Procedures</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that after the military incidents along the Beijing-Ningbo Railway line, the U.S. Navy's deployment procedures for this summer will undergo slight changes. The transport ship Henderson, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on April 29th, was originally intended to continue to Qinhuangdao but will now change its destination to Tanggu because the section of the Beijing-Ningbo Railway between Yu and Luan is currently occupied by the Japanese, and eastbound trains only reach Tangshan at this time. In addition, there are rumors that the U.S. Naval authorities are currently considering the possibility of not sending the Asiatic Fleet to Yantai this summer and instead conducting summer exercises in Qingdao.</p>

The coal extracted is transported by train to Qinhuangdao for shipment to the south and overseas.</p>

<h3>Briton Harvey Fined 50 Pounds for Speeding</h3>
<p>Equivalent to Over 820 Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Heaviest Fine in the British Police Court</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reported that the case of British expatriate Harvey being charged with speeding and failing to stop and report to the police after causing an accident was adjudicated yesterday by Mr. Morriss, acting magistrate of the British Police Court. For the speeding charge, a fine of 30 pounds was imposed, or alternatively, three months in prison. For the charge of failing to report to the police, a fine of 20 pounds was imposed, totaling 50 pounds. At the current exchange rate, this is equivalent to approximately 827.50 silver dollars, which is said to be the heaviest fine ever imposed by the court in the history of handling traffic violations. It is reported that Harvey was accused of driving a Ford car at a speed of 35 miles per hour eastbound on Jing'an Temple Road at 1:00 AM on April 3. After hitting two rickshaws near the Carter Road intersection, he did not stop to report to the police. The two rickshaw pullers were taken to Renji Hospital by passersby. One of them is still hospitalized and may require treatment for five months before being discharged. The case was prosecuted by barrister Li Wensi Dong, representing the police department from the Gao Yi Mansion, and was tried for two days. When delivering the verdict, the magistrate stated that although there was no loss of life in the case, the damage was not significant, but he considered the circumstances to be very serious and hesitated greatly about not sending the defendant to prison.</p>
<h3>Issue of Measurement and Weight Instrument Verification Fees</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Replies to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Free Re-inspection is Possible</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a petition from the Measurement and Weight Instrument Trade Association stating that after the promulgation of the revised rules for the collection of measurement and weight instrument verification fees, the fees charged exceeded the previously set municipal figures. In addition, the municipal verification office still charges fees for re-verification of items that fail the initial verification, which is an excessive burden. The merchants are unable to bear it and request that the matter be forwarded to the government to reduce the fees in order to facilitate implementation. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry for review. It is now learned that the Ministry has replied: "The petition has been received. The revised rules for the collection of measurement and weight instrument verification fees have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record and promulgated by the Ministry. It is difficult to amend them. However, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and reduce costs, re-inspection of non-compliant measurement and weight instruments after they have been corrected should be free of charge. The Shanghai Municipal Government has been notified to instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to comply with this." This reply is to be forwarded for notification.</p>
<h3>Suppressing Unqualified Doctors, Fake Medicines, and Excessive Advertising</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, having previously received a letter from the Municipal Medical Association regarding the proliferation of exaggerated advertisements by unqualified doctors and fake medicines in various newspapers in the city, notified all newspapers to prohibit the publication of such advertisements. It also submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward a letter to the two concessions for joint suppression. The Municipal Government considered that the wording of the advertisements was largely inconsistent with the city's regulations for suppressing prohibited advertisements in newspapers, and therefore sent separate letters to the First and Second Special District Courts and the Public Concession Works Department and the French Concession Municipal Council for joint suppression.</p>

<h3>Former Husband's Wife-Killing Case Re-Emerges</h3>
<p>Yang Fusheng Unnecessarily Throws Himself into the Net</p>
<p>Shen Gendi Frightenedly Reports to the Authorities</p>
<p>Shen Gendi, a woman from Hubei, is 19 years old. Her parents died when she was young and she was raised by her aunt. At the age of 15, she married Yang Fusheng, a man from Pudong. Yang was an idler, and after the marriage, the couple's relationship failed to harmonize. After a year, the two became increasingly estranged, and Gendi was often abused, so she returned to her aunt's home and never went back. Later, her aunt arranged for her to marry Qi Qinsheng, a man from Yuyao, who was 29 years old and set up incense and candle stalls in temples in the area. He lived at No. 8 Huai Xianfang in the city. Before long, her former husband, Yang Fusheng, learned of the matter. He immediately argued with her aunt, and as a result, the Shen family paid him one hundred yuan to settle the matter. However, recently Yang was in economic distress and had difficulty making a living, so he asked Mrs. Sheng, an acquaintance in Shanghai, to go to the Ye family and secretly borrow money from Gendi, but he was unsuccessful. Feeling resentful of her heartlessness, he suddenly became murderous. On the morning of the 14th of last month, at around 8:00 AM, he carried a sharp blade and waited at the entrance of Huai Xianfang. He saw Gendi come out to buy vegetables, and Yang immediately jumped forward, pulled out the sharp blade, and stabbed her repeatedly, causing more than a dozen knife wounds to her head, arms, and other parts of her body. She fell to the ground in extreme pain, bleeding profusely. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Yang abandoned the sharp blade and fled. Ye took her to a Shanghai hospital for treatment, while reporting to the police to pursue the murderer. After more than a month, Gendi recovered from her injuries and was discharged from the hospital. However, after causing this major disaster, Yang knew that he could not escape the law in the future, as the police had issued a strict arrest warrant. Recently, he heard that Gendi had returned home, so yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, he disguised himself as a vegetable vendor and, accompanied by his friend Lu Asan, waited again at the entrance of Huai Xianfang. Before long, he saw Gendi come out, intending to take a bath, so he approached her and cried out. Gendi heard the voice and saw that it was her former husband. She was greatly alarmed, fearing that he would seek revenge again, and hurried home, calling out to her husband, Ye Qinsheng, to rush out. They seized Yang and Lu together and handed them over to the patrol police of the 2nd Precinct of the 1st District. The police chief brought them to the station, and after preliminary questioning by the station chief, he determined that the matter concerned a murder case and ordered a written report to be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Chunfang Sentenced to Five Years in Prison for Impersonating the Aviation Patriotic Salvation Donation</h3>
<p>(Deprivation of Political Rights for Eight Years)</p>

Someone secretly reported him to the authorities, and the Songhu Garrison Command ordered the adjutant's office to arrest Wang Chunfang and hand him over to the command's military law department for investigation. It has been confirmed that he committed the crime and he has been sentenced to five years in prison and deprived of political rights for eight years. It is reported that he has been imprisoned.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Arrest Three Robbers</h3>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the detective department of the French Concession Police received a secret report and successively arrested three robbers, Zhai Bukai, Hu Debiao, and Zhu Hengfu. It has been temporarily ascertained that they have committed three robberies. On January 26, they robbed the Yanzhi (cigarette paper) shop at No. 798 Beile Road of more than 100 yuan. On March 12, they robbed the bowl shop at No. 120 Caishi Road of 26 yuan. On April 17, they jointly robbed the Fuxing Yanzhi shop at No. 224 Rue du Père Huc of more than 150 yuan.

<h3>Younger Brother Commits Crime, Older Brother Gives False Testimony</h3>
<p>Tang Shengfu Detained on Suspicion of Selling Opium</p>
<p>Brother Gives False Testimony Under an Assumed Name and Dies in Prison</p>
<p>At 6:40 AM on the morning of the 2nd of this month, Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkou Police Station arrested opium dealer Sun Caiyuan near the Yihua Wharf on Jichang Road, along with 170 pounds of opium and chauffeur Shen Fulin. They were taken to the police station and then sent to the First Special District Court the next morning. Sun Caiyuan stated that he had been invited to the wharf that morning by Chen Jinshan, who was at large, to collect a security deposit from a stoker named Jia on the Ruihe ship. He was instructed to change the date to the 10th to clarify the matter. On the due date, Judge Xiao Xiefei and Prosecutor Wang Zuze opened a court session and continued the interrogation. An elderly man claiming to be Chen Jinshan from Ningbo, 51 years old, testified that he had asked Sun Caiyuan to go to the Ruihe to collect the money and had three account books as evidence. The court ordered Sun to withdraw to the waiting room to separately verify the testimonies, which were contradictory. As a result, Sun Caiyuan was sentenced to one year in prison and fined 500 yuan. Chauffeur Shen Fulin was released as he was not involved. At that time, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the witness Chen Jinshan's testimony was false and that he was suspected of being involved in the opium transportation. The police were about to arrest him, but since he had already surrendered, he requested that he be temporarily detained for further investigation. The court approved the request. Now, during the postponement, someone reported that the elderly man was not Chen Jinshan but had been invited by the defendant's family to give false testimony in order to absolve him of his crime. Therefore, the police filed a public prosecution on the charge of perjury under Article 179 of the Criminal Law. On the morning of the 19th, he was sent to the court for trial, but before the trial, the elderly man suddenly fell ill in the detention center, became delirious, and was unable to be interrogated. He was sent to the police hospital for treatment, but he died at 6:50 PM. The body was sent to the Fei Lun Road morgue. The next morning, the court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to go to the morgue and verify that he had indeed died of illness. The body was handed over to his wife, Wang, to claim the body for coffin burial. Yesterday morning, the police sent the solution report of the case to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin, representing the court, stated that the deceased Chen Jinshan was indeed using a false name. During the postponement, the police received a report from his neighbor stating that his real name was Tang Shengcai, and his younger brother Tang Shengfu (Sun Caiyuan, who was sentenced to one year in prison) had provided him with three salt books and asked him to go to court to impersonate Chen Jinshan in order to rescue his brother. On the 18th, the deceased admitted to the police that his name was Tang Shengcai and that he had used a false name to testify in court in order to exonerate his brother Tang Shengfu. The police have a confession with the deceased's fingerprint. However, the hospital doctor determined that his illness was myocarditis. The police lawyer stated that the police, based on Article 305 of the Criminal Law, stated that the defendant had died and requested that the trial be terminated. Judge Xiao ruled to postpone the hearing. Sun Caiyuan was still sent to prison.</p>

<h3>Introducing Domestic Hair Clippers</h3>
<p>Shen Shuxia of the Shanghai Women's Hairdressing Training Institute has always paid attention to domestic products for hairdressing tools. Since the boycott of Japanese goods, the most difficult item for the hairdressing industry has been Japanese hair clippers, (1) because Western-style clippers have fine teeth and are arranged too tightly, which is not suitable for the coarse and stiff hair of yellow people, (2) because there are no equivalent domestic products to replace them, the "Heavenly Brand" clippers from Hanhe Foreign Firm are still secretly sold on the market. According to reliable investigations, Hanhe's "Heavenly Brand" clippers are imported and sold annually to the provinces along the Yangtze River, with 1,500 dozens. Adding in North China, South China, and Southeast Asia, the total should be over 6,000 dozens. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, considering only Hanhe's hair clippers, the outflow of money has already been about 4.5 million yuan. Other items such as Hanhe's haircutting scissors, razors, combs, brushes, etc., as well as various products from other companies, sold in our country, are mostly not yet calculated. Recently, according to what is known, there are already four domestic hair clipper manufacturers: (1) "128 Brand" from the Great Shanghai Factory, (2) "Li Brand" from the Lifeng Factory, (3) "Hengxin Brand" from the Zhonghe Factory, (4) "Samsung Brand" from a certain factory. The "128 Brand" is the most advanced of the four. Its design imitates Hanhe's "Heavenly Brand," and the price is low. The steel is durable, exquisite, and shiny, even surpassing the "Heavenly Brand". Since its opening, nearly a hundred dozens have been sold in less than three days, which can be called a small success for domestic hair clippers. The factory is located at Xiaomu Bridge in Longhua. Major companies, shops, and hardware departments in this city all sell it. The domestic hairdressing industry should actively promote its purchase and use.</p>
<h3>Xin Renhe Steamer Released</h3>
<p>Steamer Released at Company's Request</p>
<p>Hiring New Crew and Preparing for Immediate Return to Service</p>
<p>The Xin Renhe steamer of the Yuxing Company in Nanshi had previously caused a death when crew members beat a peddler and threw him into the sea. On the evening of the 18th, when the steamer returned to Shanghai, the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Corps, having been informed in advance, sent police sergeants and detectives to wait at the pier. When the steamer arrived in Shanghai and was about to dock, they immediately arrested all the crew members. The next day, they reported to the General Public Security Bureau for disposition. They are currently under investigation. The Xin Renhe steamer was also being monitored by police officers dispatched by the Water Patrol Corps, as reported in previous news. Yesterday, according to Mr. Wu, an employee of the company, because there were still passengers and cargo on board that had not been unloaded, fearing damage, the company took steps to request the Water Patrol Corps to release the ship to facilitate unloading. This was approved, so the goods inside the ship were completely cleared yesterday morning. He also said that the crew members who caused the accident will be subject to legal judgment. After the company requested the release of the steamer, it was moved to the Yangshupu River surface this morning (that is, yesterday morning), tied to a river pontoon, planning to tidy up everything on the ship and immediately hire new crew members to resume service and maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Fire at Workshop, One Fatality</h3>
<p>Around 12 o'clock last night, a workshop at the intersection of Datong Road and Avenue Road in the Public Concession suddenly caught fire. Flames shot through the roof, and the fire was fierce. A large amount of wood was burned inside the workshop. It is said that one worker was burned to death. The Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and worked hard to put out the fire, which was extinguished only at 1:30 this morning. The extent of the losses is unknown.</p>
<h3>Two Traitors Arrested</h3>
<p>(Killed Soldiers Stationed as Sentry for the 19th Route Army During the January 28th Incident)</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident last year, the 19th Route Army put up a desperate resistance, but a group of traitors acted as accomplices, plotting to undermine it. Some traitors assassinated the army's sentry soldiers at night. After the incident, the perpetrators were found, but the traitors Zhao Boying and Zhao Qianji, father and son, etc., fled by boat, drifting on the rivers and lakes to avoid capture. After the Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters learned of this, they ordered Detective Chief Xu Jinqing to search for them in Shanghai. They were discovered hiding in Dajinjia Lane in western Shanghai a few days ago. When an attempt was made to arrest them, they incited their followers to resist. Detective Xu, together with the Sixth District Police Station, bravely captured Zhao Qianji. The others escaped. Zhao Qianji was immediately taken into custody for severe punishment according to the law.</p>
<h3>March Park Report</h3>

<h3>Lu Xincai Embezzlement Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Three Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lu Xincai from Shaoxing, residing at No. 19 Dapuqiao in the French Concession, worked as an assistant to Cao Pinfa, a street runner at Yongxing Foreign Firm at No. 16 Museum Road. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month around 2:00 PM, Cao handed Lu 2,228 yuan for customs declaration fees and instructed him to pay it to customs on his behalf. However, Lu had evil intentions when he had such a large sum of money in hand, and embezzled all of it, disappearing without a trace. Cao discovered this and reported it to Mr. Mai Tai, the Western owner of the firm, who reported it to the police for investigation. It was not until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that Lu's father apprehended Lu Xincai in Fushou Lane on Haining Road and handed him over to Chinese Detective Chen Dabao, who took him to the Huishi Police Station. A check for 1,500 yuan from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and a check for 223 yuan and 2 cents in customs gold from the Yongsheng Qianzhuang were found on his person. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Summary Court of the First Special District Court. Mr. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the police station, detailed the above situation, stating that he was prosecuting according to Article 356 of the Criminal Law for embezzlement and requested investigation. Cao Pinfa also complained that, in addition to the seized checks, etc., 190 yuan was still missing. The defendant admitted to the embezzlement after being questioned. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confession and sentenced the defendant Lu Xincai to three months imprisonment for the crime of embezzlement, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Chen Kan Sues Lin Zhongwen for Defamation</h3>
<p>Request for Judge to Recuse Himself Denied</p>
<p>Plaintiff Fails to Appear at Hearing</p>
<p>Lawyer Yuan Xilian was previously commissioned by Lin Zhongwen from Fujian to litigate against Chen Kan. Lawyer Yuan was in the process of hearing the case and, on behalf of his client, published advertisements in various newspapers for the arrest of Chen Kan, and also published Chen Kan's photograph in the newspapers. Now Chen alleges that these actions by Lawyer Yuan and others have damaged his reputation, so he filed a criminal self-accusation of defamation against Yuan and Lin Zhongwen with the First Special District Court. Judge Qian Wenji of the court once held a hearing and summoned both parties for questioning. Because further investigation of evidence was needed, the case was postponed. After being interrogated that day, Chen Kan suddenly developed a misunderstanding of the judge and immediately submitted a request to the special court, asking Judge Qian Wenji to recuse himself and assign another judge to hear the case. After reviewing the case, the court authorities held that although the law allows litigants to request a judge to recuse himself, Chen Kan's request was unreasonable and should not be granted, so it was rejected. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian continued to hear the case, but the plaintiff Chen Kan failed to appear in court. Zhu Caichen, a detective from the French Concession police station, appeared in court as a witness, stating that he had received an arrest warrant on January 25th. Because the address of the wanted person was unknown, he inquired about Chen Kan's address at Lawyer Yuan's office and went to investigate. His second landlord told him that he had already moved and his whereabouts were unknown. The defendant's lawyer then argued that the defendant had obtained permission from the court to publish the advertisement. These facts can be verified in the case file. Judge Qian then ordered the case to be postponed for further hearing in order to obtain the case file from the Second Special District Court.</p>
<h3>Lewd Conduct with Young Woman, Two Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Ni Cailang Commits Negligent Injury</p>
<p>Ni Cailang from Chongming was a deliveryman for the Model Milk Company. The day before yesterday morning, Ni was ordered to pull a small cart No. 7547, loaded with milk, to deliver to various places. When the cart passed near Qinghai Road on Jing'an Temple Road, young women Zhao Meizhen and Zhang Yueqing happened to be riding in a rickshaw No. 4971 from west to east, passing Ni's cart. Seeing that the two women were beautiful, Ni was immediately overcome with lust and followed the rickshaw, making lewd remarks. The two women ignored him. Ni then pulled his cart in front of the rickshaw and asked the rickshaw puller, Yu Ruxi, where he was going. Unexpectedly, the two vehicles were too close together and collided violently. The rickshaw was hit and overturned immediately, and the two women fell to the ground with the rickshaw, both suffering head injuries and bleeding profusely. Detective Ye Yushan from the Xinzha Police Station happened to be passing by and arrested Ni and took him to the police station. The two women were sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After examination by a doctor, Zhang's injuries were found to be minor, while Zhao's injuries were more severe. After applying medicine, they were both discharged from the hospital. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Summary Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyers Li Zhishan and Jiang Baolian presented the case, prosecuting him for negligent injury under Article 304 of the Criminal Law and requesting that he be punished according to the law. Zhang and Zhao also filed a case, testifying about the defendant's lewd conduct at the time. Ni Cailang also confessed to the crime. Judge Liu Yugui verified the confession and sentenced Ni Cailang to two months imprisonment for the crime of negligent injury in the course of his business, as a warning.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Mr. Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>I have read the news item (Wang Zhengting's public statement) on page nine of your esteemed newspaper on April 19th. It is highly inappropriate. Mr. Wang has previously misled the Party and the nation, deceived the central government, and continues to deceive the people of the country. I am hereby submitting to your esteemed newspaper an electrotype demonstrating the Malayan government's permission for the Kuomintang to operate openly. I earnestly request that you publish it in its original form to clarify right and wrong. I would be most fortunate.</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
<p>Zheng Luosheng, hand-signed</p>
<p>April 20th, with an explanation attached:</p>
<p>The above two pages are notification letters from the Chinese Protectorate of the local government of British Malaya in Nanyang to Comrade Zheng Luosheng regarding the Kuomintang's affairs in 1913, which was the Gui Chou year of the abolished Qing Dynasty, or the second year of the Republic. This is sufficient to demonstrate the freedom that the Kuomintang had to conduct party affairs in Nanyang and Malaya before 1930. Before 1930, our party enjoyed freedom of action in Malaya, whether openly or semi-openly, regarding gatherings, propaganda, fundraising, and the establishment of organizations. Since former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting allowed the British Ambassador Lan Pu</p>
<h3>Reader's Advisor</h3>
<p>Regarding the Question of "Can One Go Back to the Countryside?"</p>
<p>A Collection of Discussion Letters</p>
<p>(14) Letter from Mr. Li Fujun of this city</p>
<p>The question of "Can One Go Back to the Countryside?" has sparked much discussion among readers. Except for Mr. You Huai'gao, who actively encourages people to return, the rest are doubtful about "returning." Mr. Zhang Meijun put forward four reasons for rebuttal: one cannot go to the countryside, or at least it is difficult to go. He also said (transforming society), transforming the entire society. Aspiring young people should take that path of struggle. The individualistic New Village-style transformation movement is already outdated. So, Mr. Zhang, if one cannot stand in the city, and one cannot return to the countryside, (where is that path of struggle)? I agree with Mr. You's words: (Tens of thousands of returned students from various countries and graduates of major middle schools should take on the responsibility of educating the countryside and revitalizing the countryside.) The reason is that our country is a vast agricultural country. Out of 400 million people, farmers account for 360 to 70 million. Without the organization, knowledge, and ability to participate in political power, the countryside will not be revitalized. Our lives are largely built on the countryside. Naturally, most individuals should return to the vast countryside, and not all mix in the narrow cities. Returning to the countryside is right. But Mr. You's method of returning to the countryside is too cliché and cannot break the current social stagnation. The result is inevitably disappointment, like that old gentleman from Changsha. We should not say that the old gentleman took the wrong path. His (dedication of energy and income from teaching to rural schools) is admirable.</p>
<p>(Because the Party is not in a position to do things in each region), and later came to Asia, the full text stated that there are those who will block my direct access, and affairs personnel in various parts of Asia, whether local committee members, representatives who have been arrested, deported, and whose affairs are almost dead. This is one of the reasons. I am telling all comrades this, hoping that the central government will find a way to remedy the situation, so as to restore the original state before 1930.</p>
<p>Respected Sirs,</p>
<p>I recently saw the water rate schedule approved by the Municipal Council in your newspaper. There is a phrase in its summary that says, "There are slight differences from what Mr. Feng Bingnan mentioned in person," which is not true. The content of my previous letter to the Real Estate Association stated, "(According to the new water rate schedule currently set, it is sufficient to meet the needs of users for good hygiene, and the calculation of water rates does not exceed the limit of 7.5% based on property value)," which is entirely consistent with the water rate schedule approved by the current Municipal Council. There is no discrepancy to speak of. For example, for a house with a monthly rent of 125 yuan, if the water rate is calculated at 7.5%, it is 9 yuan, 3 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li per month. The minimum monthly water rate in this morning's table is 8 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, which clearly does not exceed the limit of 7.5% based on rent. As for what I said in my previous letter about the lowest rent house being calculated at 1 fen, 7 li, and 1 hao per 1,000 gallons, and the highest rent house being calculated at 7 fen and 7 li per 1,000 gallons, this refers to the calculation of water rates for extra-category water use (any amount exceeding the amount listed in the third row of the table is extra water use), not for the amount of water within the limit. The original letter was very clear. I'm not reprinting it. I am deeply concerned that the phrase "(slight differences)" published in yesterday's newspaper will cause misunderstandings in all circles. Therefore, I am writing again to explain and hope that you will publish this letter to make corrections.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Feng Bingnan</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's meteorological forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Shandong and its surroundings are clear and slightly cold, with northwest to northeast winds. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal areas south of Ma'an Island are overcast and cold, with possible showers. The wind comes from the north to northeast. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city was a maximum of 64.8 and a minimum of 50.9. On the same day last year, the maximum was 70.0 and the minimum was 46.0.</p>
<p>(The salary is all used for that month's rural school.) is correct and admirable. Its inability to achieve great success is a matter of method. The method is based on facts. Rural bankruptcy, urban panic. Pits and valleys are full of people like Xiong Shengjun who have lost the public and cannot find a job. The reason is very clear. It is caused by the layers of exploitation and destruction by imperialism, feudal warlords, etc. Except for a few special classes, everyone is so oppressed that they can't breathe. More than 90% of these breathless people are farmers and people from rural backgrounds. Aspiring young people should go to the countryside to lead, organize, and educate tens of thousands of farmers. For example, Japan's imperialists occupied the three northeastern provinces of Rehe and invaded Tianjin and Beijing. Didn't they say that the whole country should rise up to resist? We should go to the countryside to propagandize and organize farmers to become volunteers and comfort the anti-Japanese troops! When we return to the countryside, it is not to hate the hustle and bustle of the city and fantasize about (a secluded paradise). Sing the tune of sending Li Yuan back to Pan Valley (grease my cart and feed my horse). Nor is it to teach for a few years. (Becoming a leader in a village, you can carry out village governance work). The former is to escape reality and go to the countryside for purity. This is the failed New Village Movement. The latter has the danger of Yan Xishan (village governance. To put it mildly, it is to be a leader of rural political power. To put it badly, it is to create a group of new-style local bullies. Mr. You's method has the above two drawbacks. We should oppose it. When we go to the countryside, we propagandize, organize, and educate the rural masses to participate in the entire movement to reform society. For example, if the important people of the Party and the country say that they cannot save the country unless they open up political power, then we should go to the countryside to educate the farmers. What should be emphasized here is that we should not repeat the old tunes of educating the country, saving the country through industry, and saving the country through the countryside for the past 30 years. We should know that saving the country requires the power of the masses. Without the masses, even if there is a good doctrine, it will not be realized. But if the vast countryside is awakened, I dare to guarantee that nothing will be a problem. Then again, (struggle!). Good. But what about the personal life of the unemployed Xiong Shengjun? Excuse me for not being able to make a life calculation book like Mr. You, such as borrowing one or two hundred yuan to wear a cloth robe and collecting a chicken or duck or thirty eggs. I can only answer one sentence: struggle for the life of the vast countryside. The way out for the masses' lives is the way out for individuals' lives. One more thing: only those who escape and escape struggle will freeze to death and starve to death.</p>

<h3>The Chaos at Zhongshan University is Difficult to Quell</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Orders a Report on the Cause of the Turmoil</p>
<p>The School Forbids Student Gatherings and Several Hundred Students Have Resumed Classes</p>
<p>Striking Students Demand the Reinstatement of Expelled Students and Punishment of the Culprits</p>
<p>Since the agricultural field and forestry police beat and injured the agricultural field technicians, students have risen up to help and a strike has occurred. The school authorities believe that this student turmoil has a political background and immediately expelled Dai Jiaqi, Jiang Yidong, Zhang Jinxuan, Wang Zuoren, Zheng Yiyi, Gu E, Chen Bin and other seven students who took the lead in instigating the student turmoil, ordering them to leave the school, and disbanding the Forestry Field Massacre Aid Association. On the afternoon of the 13th, agricultural school students issued a declaration and posted anti-Zou slogans in the school. Some students held a meeting in the dormitory at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, and planned to convene a second general meeting of all faculty and students in the school on the morning of the 14th to discuss how to deal with the school's expulsion of students. Later, the school authorities learned of this and, in order to prevent student riots, sent a letter to the military and police to maintain order. Therefore, on the morning of the 14th, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and the Gendarmerie Headquarters sent a large number of detectives to the school to prevent students from gathering. Therefore, the general meeting of all faculty and students on the morning of the 14th could not be held. At the same time, student slogans and notices in the school and dormitory were also torn off by the school police. By the afternoon, the students had taken no action, and the military police detectives began to leave the school. The school authorities, while preventing reactionary students, persuaded neutral students to resume classes. On the 14th, half of the students in the high school department of the school attended classes. A small number of students from the Department of Literature also attended classes, but the students from the College of Agriculture have not yet resumed classes. From the 19th to the 16th and 17th, the South China Four University Joint Sports Meet was held at the Zhongda playground, and Zhongda had announced that classes would be suspended for three days, so the students did not fully return to school. It is reported that 750 students, including a student named Chen, have resumed classes on the 15th, and at the same time, they issued an automatic resumption of classes announcement to their classmates, advising all students who have not attended classes to resume their studies. However, the students who are still on strike insisted that the seven students who were expelled, including Dai Jiaqi, were elected by the general assembly, and now they have been expelled, so the strikers are strongly arguing about this point and demanding that the school authorities confirm that Zou Libing and others who caused the incident have been escorted to the Public Security Bureau for strict handling in accordance with the law before they will completely resume classes. However, the school authorities are afraid that it will be difficult to change their mind in order to maintain their prestige with regard to the above two items. If the dispute continues, the Zhongda strike wave may not be completely quelled within a few days (17th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 21st) The Ministry of Education telegraphed the President of Zhongshan University in Guangdong on the 21st, saying, "Please submit a detailed report on the causes and handling of the turmoil at the school."</p>

Although the five people conducted a general study of education, each had a particular emphasis. For example, Cheng Qibao focused on primary school education, Yang Chong on secondary school education, Li Ximou on vocational education and university science and engineering facilities, Guo Youshou on higher education, and He Jiaxiang on social education. Therefore, when compiling reports, each focused on the aspects they had emphasized, and also made more preparations. However, it is reported that when the members were studying, the materials provided by various countries were used as reference for the reports, such as the second batch of materials from France that had not arrived, and the materials from Italy, Russia, and Austria that had not been delivered. Therefore, the report will be completed in about one or two months. As for the Ministry sending commissioners to various provinces for investigation, it is difficult to implement at the moment, because it will be necessary to wait until the report is completed before looking at the situation and seeing if the Ministry of Education has raised funds for the investigation.</p>

<h3>Teachers in Changshu Demand Salaries, Affecting Sports Meet</h3>
<p>The teaching fees in Changshu schools have been owed by previous directors for a long time, some for as long as half a year. The county student sports meet hosted by the Education Bureau is scheduled to open on the 21st. There are more than 1,500 male and female athletes participating, and Shanghai sports experts Wang Fudan, Wang Jihuai, and Cao Yu have been invited to Changshu to serve as referees. However, Ge Renyuan, the director of the Education Bureau, has only been in office for ten days, and the finances have not yet been settled. In order to maintain the schools, 50% of the teaching fees were distributed on the 20th. However, the schools have been owed for a long time, and in this entire sports meet, each township came to the city to participate, some as far as dozens of miles, and the bureau did not provide any subsidies. Now, 50% of the arrears are released, which is really difficult to support the current situation. They demanded that the full period be released, but Ge, as the new director, was racking his brains to find a way. The schools said that if there was no solution on the morning of the 21st, they would not participate in the entire sports meet. The bureau thought that the meeting was about to start, and everything was ready, but there were no athletes, so it went to the county government overnight to find a way. It was decided to solve the problem by tomorrow morning (22nd), otherwise it was feared that the overall situation would be affected.</p>

<h3>Director Pan of the Education Bureau Talks About the French Concession Authorities' Order for Private Schools to Suspend Classes</h3>
<p>It Has Already Been Reported to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Negotiations Will Be Conducted Quickly to Correct the Situation</p>
<p>After eight schools, including the Chenguang Girls' Middle School in the French Concession of this city, were ordered to suspend classes by the patrol room, it is reported that they have all petitioned the municipal government and the Education Bureau to conduct strict negotiations to resume classes. A reporter visited Pan Gongzhan, director of the Education Bureau, yesterday. According to him, after receiving the reports from the schools and seeing the news reports, he immediately sent personnel to investigate. According to the report, the French Concession Municipal Council sent detectives to order the schools to suspend classes starting on the 13th of this month, saying that they were unhygienic or did not have large playgrounds. However, it was found that some of the schools' buildings were not very spacious because there were not many students, and the ones that did not have playgrounds were looking for rentals, and some even had hygiene equipment and paid great attention to cleanliness. All the necessary precautions are now being taken by the schools. The French Concession Municipal Council's sudden decision to deal with private schools within its territory without first obtaining the consent of this bureau not only hinders the authority of this bureau's administrative functions for education, but also causes students to waste their studies for no reason, which is very regrettable. A report has already been submitted to the municipal government, requesting that negotiations be conducted quickly to correct the situation in order to maintain sovereignty.</p>

<p>The Student Union of Major Universities in Shanghai, in response to the increasing urgency of foreign aggression and the deterioration of the national situation, especially telegraphed leaders in various regions of the country yesterday, urging them to go to Jinling to jointly address the national situation.

<h3>Boy Scout Troops That Have Not Been Officially Established Are Not Allowed to Conduct Activities Outside</h3>
<p>The County Education Bureau Instructs Schools to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau yesterday instructed the secondary schools and complete primary schools: "Regarding the Chinese Kuomintang Jiangsu Province Shanghai County Executive Committee's Letter No. 128, the organization of the Boy Scouts is originally to implement youth intelligence, moral, and physical education to supplement the areas not covered by school education. All organizations of this type should complete the registration procedures in accordance with the procedures in order to guide and examine them and ensure that they are qualified. It is now found that some schools or social education institutions have organized Boy Scout troops, but they usually do not pay attention to training, nor do they complete the registration procedures. They cannot be considered officially established in terms of laws and regulations, but they often conduct activities outside, and their role is to promote and advertise the organizers, which is contrary to the original purpose of organizing the Boy Scouts. Therefore, after deliberation by the 18th Committee Meeting of this committee, a letter was sent to the Education Bureau to order its subordinates to ensure that all Boy Scout troops that have not been officially established are not allowed to conduct activities outside, etc. The records are in the file. Please comply with this letter."</p>

<p>Brief History of the Zonal Tournament Ruan Weicun</p>
<p>Has a History of Twenty Years</p>
<p>This is the Seventh Official Tournament</p>
<p>This year's National Zonal Football Tournament was held yesterday in Wuchang, at the Hubei Provincial Public Stadium. The conference is scheduled for three days. The original participants were the five zones of East China, West China, Central China, South China, and North China. However, the South China team temporarily suspended participation due to the unsuitable timing. The North China team was hindered by the current situation. Currently, players have been selected, including the three teams of East China, West China, and Central China. The zonal battles of football in our country date back to the second year of Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the first National Games were held at the Nanyang Encouragement Fair in Nanjing. In addition to track and field, basketball, and tennis, football teams from various zones also went to the meeting one after another. The participants included the five teams of East China, West China, South China, North China, and Central China, which invisibly became zonal competitions. The South China and East China teams qualified for the final. As a result, South China won 1-0 and won the championship. The second National Games were held in the Temple of Heaven in Beijing in the third year of the Republic (1914). Only the east and west parts participated in the football tournament. As a result, the east part won the championship.</p>
<p>After that, domestic sports competitions were suspended for many years due to continuous wars. It was not until the 13th year of the Republic (1924) that the third National Games were held in Wuchang, and the zonal competitions continued. A total of four teams participated this year, namely the East China Zone, the North China Zone, and the two universities of Hubin and Wenhua. South China did not participate due to the date. As a result, East China and Wenhua won the final. East China won the final victory with a score of 6-1 and won the championship.</p>
<p>In May of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), in order to prepare for the seventh Far Eastern Games, the national preliminaries were held at St. John's University in Shanghai. At the same time, there was also a zonal football competition, but only the East China and North China teams participated. It was held at the China Football Field on the Observatory Road. A three-game two-win system was adopted. East China won 2-1 in the first game, North China won 2-0 in the second game, and East China won 4-3 in the third game.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Chinese National Sports Association in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), in view of the disorganization of the football community in our country and the lack of opportunities for battles, in order to seek revitalization and communication, it launched the National Zonal Football Tournament in the spring of the 15th year of the Republic (1926), held at the China Baseball Field in Shanghai, which was the new era of the official zonal tournament. The South China and East China teams participated first. The North China team was unable to attend due to the current situation, and the Central China team did not arrive temporarily. The Southeast two teams competed, taking the three-game two-win system. As a result, the South China team won two consecutive games with scores of 8-2 and 5-1. In the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the East China and South China teams continued to hold the second zonal tournament. The East China team was summoned down. The Shanghai Port representative team set off at the time to prepare for the war. Still belonged to South China.</p>
<p>In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the third National Zonal Football Tournament was held again. South China and the Chinese Association jointly represented the South Zone, and the North China Zone faced many difficulties, but was finally able to bring together strong athletes to participate in the south. As a result, the zonal tournament gradually progressed. In the triangle, East China first won 4-2 against South China, and South China won 9-1 against North China. East China then won against North China, and the championship was won by East China. An unprecedented record. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the fourth National Zonal Football Tournament was held in North China at the request of the North Zone. However, the South China team was unable to participate due to the unsuitable climate. The East China and North China teams competed for the championship, adopting a three-game three-win system, held separately in Beijing and Tianjin, in order to promote the attention of the northern people and arouse the interest of the football community. It was a good policy. As a result, the East China team won two consecutive games with scores of 3-0 and 1-0, maintaining the championship.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the fifth National Zonal Football Tournament was held in Hong Kong. The North China team was unable to participate due to the long distance. In the first game between the South China and East China teams, East China scored two goals first, and South China scored two goals each, resulting in a draw. In the second game, the game ended in a 3-3 draw after extra time, with each team scoring one goal, resulting in a 4-4 draw. Therefore, a third final game was played, with 17,000 spectators, an unprecedented scene. As a result, South China won 4-1. In the previous two games, East China had many opportunities, but failed to win in the first half and lost in the second half, which was a pity.</p>
<p>In April of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the sixth National Zonal Football Tournament was held again in Shanghai. The participants included the East China, North China, and Central China teams. The South China team was absent. The West China team was delayed in starting and did not make it in time. As a result of the competition, the North China team first won 2-1 against Central China, and East China then won 10-0 against Central China. In the final between East China and North China, East China won 5-1 against North China. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), due to the severity of the national crisis, the zonal tournament was postponed until this year. This competition is actually the seventh official zonal tournament. In the past six tournaments, the East China team has won four times, and the South China team has won twice.</p>

<p>Regarding Grid Leak</p>
<h3>The Most Perfect Grid Leak</h3>
<p>— Qǐ</p>
<p>Readers probably already know what a diode vacuum tube is, right? It only has a filament and a plate and no grid. In addition to being used as a detector and rectifier, it also has a wonderful use as a variable grid leak.</p>
<p>When no current is applied to the filament of a diode, the resistance of the space between the filament and the plate is infinitely high. If current is applied to the filament, the resistance of this space can be changed to varying degrees from infinitely high to several thousand ohms. Therefore, a diode vacuum tube plus a set of batteries and a resistor is the most reliable variable grid leak. Its usage can be seen in the attached diagram.</p>
<h3>Preventing Noise from Grid Leak</h3>
<p>— Qǐ</p>
<p>A bad grid leak, like other bad components, can also generate noise. The reason is that fine carbon particles will make slight sounds when they rub against each other. When these carbon particles move slightly due to mechanical force or temperature, they will change the resistance of the grid leak, causing changes in the sound current, and at the same time, a noise will be emitted in the earphones or speakers. Therefore, the grid leak must be manufactured with the best materials and avoid adverse effects such as humidity. If it is a homemade grid leak with pencil lines, it is best to soak it in paraffin wax after wiring. Speaking of wiring, it is best to clamp it with small copper clips, because the obstruction of the grid leak is often caused by poor wiring.</p>
<h3>A Free Grid Leak</h3>
<p>— Lǐ Yuánqìng</p>
<p>Take a match, cut off the black head, coat it with a black 6B pencil, and wrap thin copper wire around both ends to make a practical grid resistor.</p>
<h3>Radio with Multiple Speakers</h3>
<p>— Xiāng</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a radio with several loudspeakers (also called speakers, commonly known as horns)? You may think that using several speakers can make the sound louder. No, now I will explain its function.</p>
<p>The range of sound frequency emitted by each speaker has certain limitations. Ordinary single-speaker radios can rarely achieve satisfactory results for sounds above 4000 cycles. The reason why we often encounter high sounds that are dull in radios is this reason. In order to remedy this drawback, radios with multiple speakers have been invented to combine speakers with different frequencies in one radio and assign them to emit different frequencies of sound. This device can naturally emit sounds up to 12,000 cycles. There are two ways to combine them: The first method is to combine two or three speakers with different frequency ranges as shown in Figure 1. Each speaker is connected to different selector filters. This filter can only allow the current within the frequency range suitable for a certain speaker to pass through, and the rest is completely removed. This way, the sound emitted in one speaker cannot be emitted in other speakers.</p>
<p>The speakers used in the second method are the same as the first method, but instead of directly connecting the filters to each speaker, an output amplification stage is used instead (Figure 2). Because this amplification stage has matching input and output transformers, it can only supply current suitable for a certain speaker. Before the input of the amplification stage, a selector filter is still connected to each, so that voltages with mismatched frequencies cannot reach the input circuit of each amplification stage, and each speaker can exert its special effect.</p>
<h3>Assorted Antenna Knowledge (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yunjiao</p>
<p>Antennas have a close relationship with environmental climate. In areas surrounded by many buildings, especially tall steel-reinforced concrete structures, the reception range of installed antennas is reduced compared to open areas, because a portion of the radio waves is absorbed by the buildings. East-west reception is closer than north-south due to the Earth's magnetic properties. Summer reception is closer than winter, and daytime reception is closer than nighttime, because a portion of the radio waves is often captured by sunlight.</p>
<p>If an antenna is installed on a rooftop, it should be at least five feet away from the roof surface. The lead-in wire should not lie in the corrugations of the tiles, to avoid the problem of deteriorated insulation and leakage. Furthermore, it should not be twisted with the ground wire or lead-in wire, to prevent the antenna current from leaking to the ground due to induction. If it is necessary to install the ground wire and lead-in wire in parallel, the two wires should be spaced two or three inches apart.</p>
<p>Practical experience has shown that an unlimited number of radios can be connected to a single ground wire, but the opposite is true for antennas, which must be installed separately to avoid affecting reception efficiency.</p>
<p>A short antenna has a small capacitance, good selectivity, and receives local stations well, but distant stations less well. A long antenna has a large capacitance, receives distant stations well, but has poorer selectivity for local stations. If an antenna is too long and difficult to shorten, a small variable capacitor with five or seven plates can be connected in series to reduce the length, which can increase selectivity, but reduce volume.</p>
<p>An antenna that is too short cannot easily receive stations with longer wavelengths. Therefore, shortwave radios can use short antennas, while longwave radios must use long antennas. The total length of the antenna, ground wire, and lead-in wire should not exceed 50 meters. If the ground wire is too long, the antenna lead-in wire can be shortened appropriately to balance the inductance. Indoor antennas are not suitable for installation in steel-reinforced concrete buildings. A lightning arrester should be installed between the outdoor antenna and the ground wire, or a knife switch can be used to control the on/off function, to prevent violent atmospheric electricity from entering the room during thunderstorms, causing accidental danger. See Figure 6 for wiring diagram. (The End)</p>
<p>Small Experiences</p>
<h3>Using a Compass to Make a Regenerative Coil Adjustment Frame</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Attaching a wooden handle to the rotating screw of a compass, and then mounting two spiderweb-shaped coil boards on the two legs, creates a very precise regenerative coil adjustment frame.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>Science Prize Award Announced: The China Wireless Research Society previously held a science prize guessing game at the Industrial and Railway Exhibition. The method was to have people guess the capacitance of a capacitor, with the closest guess winning the grand prize. The capacitance of the capacitor has now been revealed. Mr. Jiang Jiaren's guess was the closest and he won the grand prize.</p>
<p>Electrical "Fu Lai" Broadcasting Vacuum Tube Arrives in Shanghai: "Fu Lai" is the scientist who invented the triode vacuum tube. The new "Fu Lai" broadcasting vacuum tube from this factory will arrive in Shanghai in mid-May, exclusively managed in China by the American Meichang Trading Company at 417 Fuxu Road, Shanghai. With excellent quality and clear broadcasting, it is truly good news for the radio community.</p>
<p>"You Ai Si" Radio About to Arrive in Shanghai: The "You Ai Si" radio has the loudest sound among radios, and its volume control switch has a degree pointer that is quite convenient, with an exceptionally beautiful design. The components are also very sturdy, so it is highly satisfying to buyers. After the first batch of goods arrived in Shanghai, they were sold out in an instant. The second batch of goods is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. Buyers who wish to purchase should act quickly.</p>
<p>Jianhua Electrical Company Editorial Department Invites Sales Outlets in Various Cities: The Editorial Department is publishing various wireless radio books. In addition to "Overview of Wireless Radio AC Radios," "New Wireless Radio Conventions," and "Detailed Explanation of Wireless Radio Science," which have already been published, other books such as "Shortwave Transmitters," "Storage Batteries," "Dry Batteries and Chargers," and "Wireless Radio Dictionaries" are also being published successively. However, the company finds it very inconvenient to handle mail orders from other cities. The company plans to invite sales outlets in other cities to facilitate purchases in those areas.</p>
<p>Wireless Radio Community Amidst Continuous Rain: A few days ago, during the Spring Outing holiday, the continuous rain dampened the spirits of many people who wanted to travel and enjoy the scenery. However, those who had radios at home could pass the time listening to the radio and no longer feel bored. However, it should be especially noted that radios are easily damaged in continuous rain, so it is necessary to find a reliable repair company. The Yada Company at 25 Renji Road in this city specializes in the wireless radio business. Last year, it specially established a repair department, which has received a constant stream of radios entrusted for repair. Although the company is extremely busy, it delivers promptly and issues warranties to guarantee use. In this troublesome weather, those who have radios should pay close attention.</p>
<h3>The Achievements of the Marconi Company in the Past Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Dan</p>
<p>IV. Increase in Aerial Wireless: The Marconi Company's medium-wave and short-wave radio station link from Kanapale, Uganda, through British Africa to Capetown has been completed. This radio station is dedicated to providing communications from land to air and from air to land for the Imperial Airways' air route between Cairo and Capetown, as well as many local communications.</p>
<p>The wireless radio equipment in airplanes has been the subject of special research in the past year, but on the air route, there is an extremely difficult situation: it is often necessary to encounter extremely severe electrical wave shocks. During the past year, many Marconi Company engineers spent six months flying in various airplanes on this route, engaging in research. As a result of the direct investigation research, a new aerial radio capable of applying both medium-wave and short-wave has been created. This kind of radio can communicate continuously at any time during the flight, and short wavelength will not be affected by weather changes.</p>
<p>On May 20 last year, a demonstration of the modern air-to-land and land-to-air telephone application was held. The Marconi aerial radio was installed in the famous "Flying Scotsman" express train of the London and North Railway Company, in which people could talk to people in the airplanes of Imperial Airways, and both were in progress at high speed.</p>
<p>In addition, the application of wireless radio in light aircraft has also increased greatly. Many famous aviators have already been equipped with Marconi's aerial radio.</p>
<p>In order to promote the development of British public aeronautics, the British Aviation Department ordered a very complete wireless radio from Marconi Company and built it at the Mengqiesitou Aircraft Company, which is the first complete radio station established by Great Britain in the city's airport. (To be continued)</p>
<p>News Briefs</p>
<h3>World's Largest Broadcasting Station Established Near Moscow</h3>
<p>The construction of the world's largest broadcasting radio station, located in Notingesk, 60 meters from Moscow, has been completed. The wavelength of this radio station is 1,481 meters, the power reaches 500 kilowatts, and the length of its antenna is 900 meters. The four metal pillars of this line are 200 meters high. This broadcasting station employs five engineers to manage the machines. There is a telegraph line linking the Moscow Radio Research Institute and this broadcasting station. The construction of this broadcasting station used all Russian-made materials, and the construction cost reached 7.5 million rubles, of which 3.25 million rubles were used for equipment. (TASS)</p>
<p>Langenberg's Sound Waves Reach New Zealand: Under favorable environmental conditions, medium-wave broadcasts can also reach extremely far places. The Langenberg broadcasting station received a letter from New Zealand stating that he often receives the program music from Langenberg very clearly, but the speech is sometimes slightly blurred. (Philips)</p>
<h3>The Expansion Plan of "Lai Weiqi"</h3>
<p>The Austrian Broadcasting Company recently announced a plan to greatly change the technology and improve broadcasting. The plan includes replacing all the equipment currently used with new-style sound amplifiers, and improving the communication work between the current radio stations, adopting ultra-short waves. Another important part is to build a broadcasting palace, which will cost about 6 million Austrian schillings. The cost of changing the equipment and improving broadcasting is estimated to be about 14 million schillings. This plan is expected to be completed in two years. (Philips)</p>
<h3>Swiss Invent Pocket Radio</h3>
<p>— Songfu</p>
<p>A Swiss person recently invented a wireless radio that can be placed in a pocket. It is said that this radio weighs about one pound, is five inches wide, fourteen inches long, and only one and a half inches thick, so it is very much like a rather thick book. It is reported that the Swiss government has distributed this new type of radio to police in various places, and has built broadcasting stations for this type of radio in various cities. The power of each station is 300 watts, and its control force is 50 miles.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Lou Zhanlu, Building of Soldiers' Blood</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Tang Yulin's reinstatement as military commander has aroused repercussions among fellow villagers from Rehe Province residing in Tianjin. They have reported to the special investigators Fang and Shao the four major crimes of the Tang family, father and son. The tearful words of more than a thousand characters are indeed lamentable to read. Regrettably, this piece of writing was published after Tang's defeat. If someone had revealed Tang's misdeeds in the days when Rehe was safe and sound, preventing him from holding office, and if Rehe had obtained a wise and loyal chairman, then perhaps the situation would not have deteriorated to such an extent.</p>
<p>The four major crimes listed are: (1) leaking military secrets and betraying the central government; (2) issuing paper money indiscriminately and embezzling military pay; (3) appointing cronies and levying taxes excessively; (4) being fatuous and tyrannical, and arbitrarily arresting innocent people. Among the four major crimes, the facts listed in the third item are particularly infuriating. A certain carpenter was appointed as the director of the military affairs office; a certain turtle pimp from Dalian was appointed as a military political adviser; when stationed in Pingquan, they extorted opium and raped good women; in Liaoning, Japanese stations, Nanshi Market, Sanjing Road, Er Ma Road, and Andong County, large buildings were built everywhere, all of which were multi-storied buildings. Officials and merchants and others used their exorbitant levies and embezzled pay to accumulate wealth and build them, and they were all called the Building of Soldiers' Blood, the Red Building. However, now, these Buildings of Soldiers' Blood are all flying the blood-red Rising Sun Flag.</p>
<p>(Drinking thousands of families' blood in a jade cup, burning away the wealth of the people with silver candles); this is a couplet for corrupt officials. Unfortunately, Old Tang's Building of Soldiers' Blood has been occupied by the enemy; otherwise, it could also be hung with a couplet, called: Carved railings smeared with the blood of thousands of soldiers, eaves wiped dry with the fat of the people.</p>
<h3>"China A-Si" Yongo</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>There are many White Russians in Shanghai who have no nationality and live a wandering life, called "Luo Song A-Da." There are also many people who have lost their country, become slaves of the British Empire, and harbor revolutionary sentiments in their hearts, called "Indian A-San." These fine names were all invented by our incomparably clever Chinese people and are recognized by the "people from all directions" living in Shanghai.</p>
<p>During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the imperial army marched mightily to Shanghai, intending to conquer Songhu in one fell swoop, and reach the foot of Purple Mountain without three drumbeats, forcing China to bow its head and willingly do as a Goryeo the second (annual tribute, annual court visits). At that time, there were many Japanese "China Hands" in Shanghai who, knowing what I liked, bestowed upon me a fine name, saying "China A-Si." Ah, how can I be worthy of it! The reason why I say "how can I be worthy of it" is that I have a great truth. "Luo Song A-Da" are mostly from noble families, and were accustomed to eating and using well in the past. How can ordinary Chinese people, like cattle and horses, dare to call them brothers. "Indian A-San" cannot stand a foothold in their motherland, so they drift to foreign lands. Our China (vast in land and rich in resources). When Zhabei is shelled, one can enjoy oneself in the concession. How can one connect with the hardworking, revolutionary (Indian A-San).</p>
<p>However, judging from the current (five-day-a-city, seven-day-a-market) (arranging a new battle line) and withdrawing from the situation in □□□, it is not difficult for the imperial army to eat dumplings in Pingjin, eat mooncakes in Zhengzhou and Jinan, and eat New Year's Eve dinner at the foot of Purple Mountain. If my ominous words unfortunately come true, then I have no choice but to thank my Emperor for the fine name bestowed upon me under the Rising Sun Flag.</p>
<p>However, among the 400 million (China A-Si), there must still be some distinctions, and not all should be treated the same. For example, those (Zhang Pingmins) who take dozens of boxes of gold, pearls, and jewelry to villas in Switzerland to play golf should at least be ennobled as (China A-Er). As for us, who are hopeless idiots, being (China A-Si) is already a (great imperial grace), elevating us to the highest degree.</p>
<h3>Witty Couplet</h3>
<p>— Tang</p>
<p>A certain Shen from Biling will marry into the Zhu family in Wuzhong next month, being a descendant of Zhu Zhishan. Yesterday, he gathered with several friends in a certain restaurant. The cook presented bamboo shoots. A certain person at the table, who was usually humorous, immediately composed a couplet, saying: (Baskets, meet ten days and become bamboo). The person used a pun to tease Shen. Shen knew it well and thought of a way to repay him. After a while, he replied: (You, suddenly don't look like a person). Thereupon, everyone at the table burst into laughter, and some even spat out their food. Someone like Shen is truly worthy of being a descendant of Old Snake (Zhu Zhishan).</p>
<h3>In the Rain</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>People say: (Heavenly principles are abnormal). I never really believed this statement before. People also say: (The world's morals are declining), I believe this statement one hundred and twenty percent. If you think it's wrong, you can open our history and look at it through successive generations, and you will definitely be able to prove my words. However, (heavenly principles are abnormal) is now proven to be true as well. According to the annual seasons, at this time of late spring and early summer, the thermometer should be at least above 50 degrees, and above 60 degrees at noon. But this year, when (heavenly principles are abnormal), it is greatly different. These days, in the mornings, it is still less than 40 degrees! Some elderly people still have old sheepskin robes on their backs! Even those modern girls who are not afraid of the cold are reluctant to take off their velvet coats or fur-collared coats! This shows that (spring cold is still sharp), although it is about to disappear, it still maintains its authority!</p>
<p>Some friends, whose Sundays are their days off, often say: (This year is really unlucky, every Sunday, it always rains, this is probably God playing against us!) Indeed, the spring rains this year seem to be more than in previous years. This rain problem is not only cursed by friends who rest on Sundays, but also by general big companies and big merchants, because every Sunday they can increase their income more than on weekdays, so their curses are always genuine.</p>
<p>Speaking of the word (rain), it does contain some poetic meaning. If you open the poetry collections of the ancients, aren't there fine works such as (Records of Events in a Rainy Window) (Listening to Rain in the Banana Pavilion) (Friends in the Rain), etc.? I am originally a vulgar person and cannot comprehend the taste of them. But this time when I went to Songjiang, I encountered rain again. Returning to the inn at midnight, in a corner of the small building, the sound of rain was rustling, which reminded me of two lines of poetry from the ancients: (Listening to the spring rain in a small building all night, selling apricot blossoms in a deep alley tomorrow morning.) How delicate and lingering? Although Shanghai is scientific, there is a different kind of interest on the asphalt roads in the rain. You can (look down from a high place) and see the motorcycle speeding with its speed fully opened. The rubber tires splash when they hit the slightly accumulated water on the asphalt road, which is the most meaningful time. If you go to the road, you have to be careful that your precious clothes are splashed with dirt.</p>
<h3>Other Mysteries of Suitcases</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ningyi</p>
<p>Indeed, suitcases are the most fashionable things now. In this column, Mr. Xichang has already given two mysterious examples, and he also said that other mysteries should be told by those who have briefcases themselves. I am one of the briefcase comrades, so I might as well talk about them!</p>
<p>But first, let me make it clear that I use a suitcase not to learn fashion. I don't have Western-style trousers, and what is called a long robe is just a cloth garment. If you want to talk about the mystery of my suitcase, where should I start? But I have spied on many mysteries of other people's suitcases!</p>
<p>A few classmates, in order to pretend to be athletes, buy a suitcase. Wearing bloomers and basketball shoes, it is best to hang a pair of basketball shoes on their shoulders, appearing to be an athlete. Walking in front of female students will make you a bit more impressive. Here, a suitcase is extremely mysterious. As for female students in general, although not all of them, most of them have powder and lipstick in their suitcases! In cold weather, velvet yarn and bamboo needles are also must-haves. Social novels and love novels will also appear in suitcases, and movie brochures are also many!</p>
<p>One day, I found a suitcase extremely mysterious. It was in the dormitory, A Wang's small suitcase. What do you think it contained? It wasn't books, but a silk belt, two boxes of Parisian sandalwood powder, a watch, two bottles of Pond's cold cream, and a dozen floral handkerchiefs. It turned out that he had recently gotten married, and he was preparing these things as gifts for his wife when he returned home that day (Saturday)!</p>

<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Brewing Tea to Pass the Long Night, Grieving Over the End of the Year; Inscribing Anti-Violence Day, Shouting Loudly. As soon as he heard this, he sighed twice, saying that the poorer people are, the smaller the debt is, the tighter the creditors press. He was also someone who had been pressed by creditors, knowing that our days are hard, so he took out five yuan to settle this matter for us. Not only did he take out the money, but he also said that this matter was small, telling us not to mention it, making him feel embarrassed. Do you think this matter is strange or not? He felt embarrassed giving people money. Guizhi said: This person's heart is not bad. Jiang said: I have always said this, and now you know that my words are correct, aren't you? Guizhi said: I never said he was bad. As the mother and daughter were talking, the two creditors came. Guizhi exchanged the five-yuan bill and paid off the creditors. When it was getting dark, Jiang said to Guizhi: Now we still have two yuan to buy some things for the New Year. Three hundred and sixty days are like this. As long as we have money, we should also celebrate the occasion. Guizhi smiled and said: You old-fashioned people always can't forget the New Year. Tell me, what should we buy? Jiang raised her head and thought for a while, then smiled and said: Really, what should we buy? It would be fine if we didn't say what to buy, but now that we're talking about buying things, I'm a little lost. All in all, there's only a little over a dollar. How do I know what to buy? While the mother and daughter were planning this, Zhao Weng, who was passing through the outer courtyard, heard these words. He stood by the door of the outer courtyard and first called out, "Old Mrs. Yang." Jiang replied: "Yo! Old man, busy preparing for the New Year." As she spoke, she went out to meet him, and saw that Zhao Weng was carrying two large strings of paper packages, with two red papers fluttering in between. Zhao Weng raised the paper packages in his hands and said: "It's nothing, just assorted snacks (Note: An old capital custom, at the end of the year, watermelon seeds, peanuts, red dates, sesame candy, hawthorn slices, etc., are mixed together and sold by the catty, called New Year's assorted snacks), glutinous rice cakes, and some coarse snacks. Actually, I'm so old, why should I turn back to childhood and celebrate the New Year? It's all because a few of Ziqiang's brothers in the same battalion call me 'Old Uncle,' and they will inevitably come to my place to pay their respects during the first month of the year. I'm afraid I won't be able to buy things on Haidian Street on the second, third, and fourth days of the first month, so I simply bought everything today." (49)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Night Talks</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>Café Poet</p>
<p>In the misty twilight of early spring, I bought a copy of BIEERRE LOUIS's (Private Diary) from the Hongwu Bookstore on Huanlong Road and walked westward in the rain on the sidewalk of Avenue Joffre, passing through that quiet lovers' lane.</p>
<p>Only two or three hundred steps past Avenue Albert, I pushed open a small café with a line of musical notes painted on the glass window. The score circled the five notes LA SOL RE DO RE. What an exquisite trademark design! Because the French name of this café is LA SOLE D'ORE, which translates to (Goldfish), the transliteration happens to share two homophonic characters with the musical phrase (獨覽梅花掃臘雪, Dú lǎn méihuā sǎo là xuě - gazing alone at plum blossoms sweeping away the snow of the twelfth month).</p>
<p>On a small square table, there were two or three fragrant daffodils. A cup filled with rich Turkish black coffee emitted wisps of cloud-like steam. I sat alone silently under the pearl gauze curtains, gazing at the orange-yellow ceiling and the diamond-like electric lights, fantasizing about the bizarre stories of the 1002nd night of Arabian Nights.</p>
<p>Half an hour of time vanished along with the phantasms in my mind and the coffee on the table. Opening the (Private Diary), I turned to page 307, and the name of the café poet Verlaine VERLAINE was prominently displayed before my eyes:</p>
<p>This evening, I brought blank paper to the library to copy poetry. On the way, I bumped into a person with long grey hair and a grey soft hat, sparse long whiskers, yellow eyes, walking with a cane, looking like he had difficulty walking.</p>
<p>"(Are you Mr. Verlaine?) (Yes, sir.) (I admire you very much. I met you once before. Do you remember?) (I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I... Ah! You are truly lovely, yes, lovely. But... but are you willing to walk with me? We can talk for a while!...) So we walked into a café. I told him I loved reading his works. The poor poet listened with tears in his eyes. He said in a trembling voice (Happiness) is a (Ruthless) book. A (Ruthless) book. I said inside that the only happiness is this: knowing that God is real. As soon as someone knows this, all the misfortunes in life, no matter how terrible, will vanish.</p>
<p>(Where do you live now?) (I have no residence, I lodge in the darkness.) After paying the bill, Verlaine opened his purse, inside which there was only one franc and ten centimes. He thanked me, found twenty copper coins and also took them back from the waiter. (This is all my property. What about tomorrow? I don't know. Sir, poverty is sacred, truly sacred. An hour ago, in a café, a waiter, sir, a waiter refused to serve me because I was too shabby; he said I would bother other guests.) Reading to this point, I put down the (Private Diary). Thinking of this French Symbolist folk poet spending his later years in poverty and misery, and listening to the sound of raindrops outside the window, I couldn't help but recite Verlaine's (Autumn Song): Tears are falling in my heart, like rain falling in the city. What a lonely sorrow that penetrates my heart? IL PLEUT E DANS MON COEUR COMME IL PLEUT SUR LA VILLE QUELLE CETTE LANGUEUROUI PENETRE DANS MON COELIIR</p>

<h3>The Plunge in Financial Gold Continues Unabated</h3>
<p>(Another astonishing drop... twenty-six and a half yuan) (Silver prices continue to soar, hitting a low of one hundred and ten and a half yuan) (U.S. farm relief bill unlikely to pass temporarily, rebounding to a high) The gold market's slump remains intense. The lowest market price yesterday reached 910.50 yuan (equivalent to 651 taels, breaking the 60 tael mark).

<h3>Securities and Public Debt Went Well</h3>

Because of the tension in the current situation in recent days and the urgency of Tianjin and Beijing, general short sellers sold wildly, and the amount released was extremely large, which was extremely crowded. However, Beijing and Tianjin did not waver, and it was rumored that they would not waver. The market air felt that the market was optimistic, and as the exchange delivery period of this month approached, the shorts panicked and caused a reaction. When the market opened in the morning, buyers scrambled one after another, and the troop reduction rose sharply by 1.1 yuan. In the second round, each gang still had a lot of short coverings, and the market price rose by another 0.5 or 0.6 jiao to 0.7 or 0.8 jiao.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Manufacturers Bought Standard Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, but the actual demand was still sluggish. Various gangs were still sluggish, because the economy of all parties was exhausted, and it was difficult for commerce to develop. However, some manufacturers purchased in large quantities in the futures market because they were implementing a work reduction from tomorrow, so the market slightly rebounded. However, the world trend is deteriorating, the domestic rural economy is bankrupt, the people are poor, and the money is exhausted. There is a lack of sales of the current yarn, and inferior yarn is sold at low prices, so how can this yarn rise on its own?</p>
<p>(Near-month yarn rose by 1 yuan) The opening of the human standard pre-market was due to the sharp decline in the gold market, and the silver prices in the overseas cotton market were still low. There was a lack of buyers in the market, but a certain yarn factory purchased, and the market rebounded. As a result, each month fell by 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and Jiao.

<h3>Temporary Fluctuations in Spot Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>Cotton prices initially fell and then rebounded, but the overall trend remained weak. This was due to the unfavorable global cotton market situation, coupled with a sharp rise in silver prices and a dramatic fall in gold prices. The increase in US cotton prices was minimal. Calculated silver-based prices were lower than yesterday by 90 cents to one dollar per picul. Yarn factories will implement work reductions starting tomorrow, reducing demand. However, major bullish speculators held firm and refused to release their holdings, keeping the market relatively high. Nevertheless, current cotton consumption is sluggish.</p>
<p>(Slight Decline in Spot Cotton Prices) At the opening of the morning session, spot cotton prices initially fell due to a slight increase in US cotton prices and a dramatic fall in gold prices, leading to eager selling. Prices for all months fell by 50 cents, but rebounded by 20 cents during the second and third trading periods. Consequently, prices for all months fell by 20 to 30 cents.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Price Increases Slow Down</h3>
<p>Slight Trading in This Port</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market only rose by 2 cents, reaching a price of $1.47. Yokohama slightly fell to 800 yuan. Generally, price increases should align with the purchasing power of the people and should not be excessively rapid. Therefore, the pause in yesterday's price increases is a natural trend. There was some trading in this city, but not much. Twenty bales of Baichang Jinghong brand, graded 20/22/82, were sold at a price of 725 yuan. Lianna purchased 20 bales, Tongyun purchased 20 bales, and Yihua purchased 10 bales. Thirty bales of Shandong Huangchang Jing were also sold, purchased by Lianna, at a price of 660 yuan. Yihua also purchased 10 bales of XX grade 20/22/83, at a price of 720 yuan. Another 20 bales of ordinary goods, graded 20/22/80, were purchased at a price of 700 yuan. Fifteen bales of Huangchang Jing, graded 20/22, were purchased at a price of 695 yuan. Yunchang purchased 10 bales of the WTK brand, graded 13/15, at a price of 810 yuan. XX also traded 20/22 at a price of 700 yuan, but the number of bales could not be confirmed. According to a report from the Commodity Inspection Bureau, last week's raw silk exports totaled 163 bales, plus 20 bales of factory silk, for a total of 183 bales. Attached are the prices of English, French, and Chinese silk, as shown on the left (20th): Market Grade Price National Currency. London Chinese Silk A-grade: 7 shillings 6 pence, 716; Chinese Silk B-grade: 7 shillings 6, 665; Lyon Chinese Silk A-grade: 87.5 francs, 800; Chinese Silk B-grade: 82.5 francs, 750.</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Once Showed Prosperity</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, prices for all months showed a stable, hovering trend. Foreign wheat quotations rose again by 3, 4, 6, and 7 cents, respectively. With the appreciation of silver, the increase in foreign wheat quotations seemed to be expected. However, the gold market fluctuated, and the opening price yesterday fell again by 50 to 60 yuan. This serious situation also made a deep impression on those in the industry. Therefore, at the opening, due to the increase in foreign wheat, the market seemed to have a prosperous and rising trend. However, large and small factories took advantage of the excitement to secretly sell off their holdings, so the result was that only the near term was slightly better, while the far term fell by half a cent compared to the previous day. When the afternoon session opened, the lively market atmosphere had come to an end because there was no longer a surge in buying from outsiders, and factory selling had also stopped. Prices for both near and far terms returned to being flat. The future rise and fall will depend on how foreign wheat is being hawked, and further research will be needed. Generally speaking, there is a deep fear that dumping will become even tighter. As a result, this month was better by 5 mils compared to the previous day, May was better by 7.5 mils, June was better by 2.5 mils, July was unchanged, and August and September fell by 5 mils.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Boundaries of Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>Reading "Dream of the Red Chamber," one feels that speech is quite restricted in the Jia household. Jiao Da, in his position as a slave, dared to curse from the master down to all the other slaves, saying that only the two stone lions were clean, taking advantage of his drunkenness. What was the result? The result was that the master deeply resented him, the slaves hated him, and they stuffed his mouth with horse manure.</p>
<p>In fact, Jiao Da's cursing wasn't meant to overthrow the Jia household, but to improve it, merely saying that if masters and slaves continued like this, the Jia household would be unable to continue. However, the reward he received was horse manure. Therefore, this Jiao Da was truly the Qu Yuan of the Jia household. If he could write, I think he probably would have written a "Li Sao" or something similar.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the gentlemen of the Crescent Moon Society unfortunately had a similar experience to Jiao Da. They cited classics and made some slight criticisms of the Party and the country. Although the sources they cited were mostly English classics, they didn't have the slightest malicious intent against the Party and the country, merely saying, "Sir, other people's clothes are so clean, yours are a bit dirty and should be washed." Unexpectedly, "Quan did not understand my true feelings," and a mouthful of horse manure came: denunciations from all the national newspapers. Even the "Crescent Moon" magazine suffered. But the Crescent Moon Society was ultimately a group of men of letters and scholars, so they came up with a large pile of "Li Sao Jing," citing the Three Principles of the People to clarify their intentions. Now it's all good, spitting out horse manure and replacing it with sweets. Some are advisors, some are professors, some are secretaries, and some are deans of colleges. There is freedom of speech, and "Crescent Moon" is full of so-called "art for art's sake."</p>
<p>This is because men of letters and scholars are ultimately smarter than illiterate slaves, the Party and the country are ultimately more enlightened than the Jia household, and the present is ultimately brighter than the Qianlong era: the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Yet there are still people shouting for freedom of speech. I think it should be clear that there aren't so many sweets in the world. This misunderstanding probably lies in failing to realize that the current freedom of speech is limited to saying "Sir, your clothes..." to show the master's magnanimity, and still wanting to say more.</p>
<p>This is absolutely not allowed. The former is different from the era when "Crescent Moon" suffered. Now it seems to exist. This "Free Talk" is also evidence of this, although there are still a few heroes holding horse manure, peeking around. As for wanting to say more, that is enough to undermine the guarantee of freedom of speech. You must know that although the present is brighter than before, it is also more dangerous. Saying more means even losing your life. Even if there is an explicit decree of freedom of speech, you must never be careless. I have seen this with my own eyes several times. I am not "selling old age," but I am unconsciously a gentleman who is a slave. I hope you will think about it and consider it carefully.</p>
<h3>Fatalists</h3>
<p>— Bofu</p>
<p>The sudden invasion of our country has stirred up all sorts of reactions in us, among which the most interesting and the least noticed are the appearance of things like the "Tui Bei Tu" and the "Shaobing Song." People living in Shanghai should still remember that during the January 28th Incident, the streets were full of posters of the "Shaobing Song" and the prophecies of Liu Bowen, and they should also remember the recent advertisements for this kind of book in various newspapers. What is true of Shanghai is even more likely to be true of other places.</p>
<p>"These are all superstitions that are not worth considering!" We seem to hear someone say this. That's right. But can our theoretical negation eliminate this phenomenon? Life is not just reason. We must not forget that emotion and will form the majority of our lives. Nor should we forget that this kind of superstition is the foundation of the lives of the Chinese masses.</p>
<p>Looking around, what is the most noticeable phenomenon in our social life? Is it the difficulty of life? Ask any ordinary person, and nine times out of ten they will tell you, "Our fate is too bitter." It can be seen that what they have in mind is not the problem of life, but the problem of fate. In their view, as long as their fate is good, they can also order servants around, ride in cars, eat fancy food, and be great men and celebrities. They do not admit that these people are fundamentally different from them! It may even be that these people are worse than them. At the same time, isn't that the truth? The sons of wealthy families, simply because their ancestors were rich, can wear Western clothes, dance, and chase women, regardless of whether they are geniuses or imbeciles, just like those boring literati who fill out Mahjong (they don't care about national affairs), those most vulgar and degenerate ("liberation words"). But when they sit in rickshaws, have they ever thought about what they have to compare with the people pulling the rickshaws with their feet, except for the fact that they have a few unfamiliar new terms in their heads? This is just one example. In our current life, it can be said that such inequalities of life are everywhere. The knowledge we learn is only used to deceive people in lectures and articles. It rarely improves our lives and rarely changes our will and emotions. In terms of reason, we seem to be people of the 20th century, but can we say that we are higher than the ordinary people when we are moved emotionally? Yet the material lives of each other are so far apart!</p>
<p>Humans are ultimately thinking animals. Even people with primitive minds cannot help but notice the contradictions of life, and they cannot help but look for an answer. For them, if they cannot find an answer to this question that belongs to philosophers, they will not be able to get through a single day. Therefore, their answer is "fate." Good fate and bitter fate solve all doubts and eliminate all contradictions. Along with this view of fate arise all sorts of causes and effects in this life and the next, all sorts of retributions of blessing good and punishing evil. The sayings of the "Shaobing Song" and the "Tui Bei Tu" are just the expansion of the individual's view of fate to a country.</p>
<p>These superstitions are the foundation of the lives of ordinary Chinese people, and they are their philosophy of life. If their lives do not undergo a major change, this foundation will not be shaken for a single day. If you simply tell him from the rational point of view, "This is superstition, you must not believe it," it is like telling merchants from the theoretical point of view, "You must love your country and not sell inferior goods." It only proves an undeniable fact, that is, the incompetence of reason.</p>
<h3>Before the Grave</h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>A week after my eldest son's fourth birthday was the fourth anniversary of my wife's death. My wife died of puerperal fever. As she was dying, she looked at me with pitiful eyes, gestured at her chest, and breathed her last breath miserably. I understood what she meant.</p>
<p>Although the child she left behind is very smart, he still doesn't know that his real mother isn't the young woman who is currently his stepmother. Whenever I see the child biting his little finger, leaning against the wall alone, and staring blankly, I can't help but remember his dead mother. The child's lively eyes and dreamy expression are exactly like my dead wife. I often feel that I have wronged the dead mother and the little life she left to me in many ways. Although my current wife treats this child the same as she treats her own two-year-old child, whenever I see my eldest son's expression, which is so much like his birth mother's, I always feel a little miserable in my heart.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's not purely psychological, but I often feel that because my current wife is present, I give my second child more love and affection. When I realize this, I seem to hear my former wife sighing in another world. So, I push the infant away in remorse and hug my eldest son.</p>
<p>But young children crave the love of their parents. The infant, having been pushed away, still rolls around me like a ball, wanting me to hold him. So, my wife says:</p>
<p>"Dabao! Let your little brother have a turn. You're bigger than him."</p>
<p>Dabao hugs my neck and whines unwillingly.</p>
<p>I fix my eyes on Dabao's eyes. Suddenly, I angrily scold the infant who is clinging to my knees: "What's younger and older! You always side with your own child!" Angrily, I say to my wife. My wife is a little dazed by my sudden anger. Slowly, she lowers her head and cries! So, I feel a little sorry for my stepmother again! My wife in the ground has been dead for four years. My wife died on Qingming Day. The peach blossoms she planted with her own hands outside the window are already in full bloom. I remember my wife, who is buried in the Wanguo Cemetery, so I take my family to sweep the grave.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, there is hardly anyone in the Wanguo Cemetery. We quietly lean a pair of wreaths against my wife's tombstone. "Dabao! Come over and bow with Daddy." The child widens his eyes. "Come and do as Daddy does. Be good and bow." "Daddy, what's this?" "This is... be a good boy and bow. This is a grave..." The child's lively eyes make me think of all the good things my wife did when she was alive, and I sigh.</p>
<p>My stepmother also puts down the child in her arms and bows to the grave. She ponders the wreath for a while, shakes her head sadly, and her eyes suddenly become moist. "I think life is really terrible!" Her voice is very miserable. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Maybe in three or four years, I will have to mourn you and another woman..." I force a smile: "You can believe me. I will love both children equally! Maybe I will go before you!"</p>
<p>"Don't say that!" My wife quickly covers my mouth. "The affairs of the world are unpredictable." Who knows what will happen in three or four years?</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Era and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>He felt colder and colder all over, but he had to walk downstairs shivering. As soon as he opened the back door, he saw the associate pastor Liao standing in front of him. Haiquan was even more surprised.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Lin!" Pastor Liao looked at Haiquan, also expressing surprise. "Mr. Liao, what's the matter?" "Ah, Lao Cao is not feeling well. At first, we thought it was just a slight cold. But later, we found out that he had a severe fever. So Pastor Ha asked me to send him back. He needs to rest for a few days. He doesn't need to go to church..." "Where is Lao Cao now?" "In the car. The car can't drive in. It's parked at the entrance of the alley." After more than twenty minutes, the three of them carried the patient to bed and asked him to lie down. Although Shiguang's temperature was very high, he was still mentally clear. He said many sorry things to Haiquan in his sleep. The more Shiguang said this, the more Haiquan couldn't bear to leave them. He had to help Qiuying with the chores at home. And Qiuying often either gave him strange glances or pinched his wrist. When they went to the door of the room together to cook, she sometimes stretched out her mouth to ask him to kiss her. "This is terrible! I have unknowingly fallen into a trap! She has really kicked herself on the head from high in the sky and then kept dancing on her head." Qiuying also made more explicit expressions. Sometimes, she mourned her bitter fate, marrying the wrong person, and at the same time expressed how much she loved him. Sometimes, she complained that she worked too much and didn't get enough nutrition, so she was so thin, and at the same time, she revealed her chest and snow-white legs for Haiquan to see.</p>
<p>Haiquan was lured by Qiuying in this way and worked hard for three or four days in a row. He was almost becoming their "XX maid." "I am too unaspiring. I am a good Chinese man! I am a promising revolutionary youth!" Once, he told her that he wanted to go out for a walk and come back to see them tomorrow. "Mr. Lin, isn't that too unkind? Seeing me in such a mess, serving the patient and taking care of the children, can you bear to leave?" After she said this, she showed a face full of displeasure. Haiquan was stunned by what she said and couldn't speak or move for a while. "XX, when you want someone to make you happy, XX..." Haiquan was startled before he finished hearing her words. He thought, she is really fierce. But he couldn't defend himself. She had already grasped his weakness. "Okay, I won't leave." He could only answer her with a wry smile. "That's a good boy!" She sent another strange glance. "XX Mr. Lin, I really like you. Even if you leave me for a moment, I don't know how lonely and sad I will be!"</p>

<h3>Blood, Tears, Strength!</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>Heart, my heart where my spirit resides! Do you still remember? One afternoon in the midst of bleak winds and bitter rain, amidst the mournful cries of the train whistle, I tricked my mother and slipped away to the train station to see you off. If there hadn't been so many people at the station that day, I really would have hugged you and wept bitterly, yet in the end, I stood in the wind and rain, tears streaming down my face, and watched your shadow blur and disappear! Heart, because of this separation, I know very well that it is extraordinary! How could I not be heartbroken at that time and never be able to make up for it?</p>
<p>But, you should also give my mother some understanding. Mother is certainly a person who only knows profit, but she is a pathetic fool without knowledge! Do you still not understand this? I have repeatedly asked you in the past ("Work hard on your career, and in the future we will surely win back Mother's heart"), although these words did indeed cause you great resentment and curses against reality, even scolding all of humanity. However, in the moment after each of your bursts of anger, didn't you always say ("Yes, I need to cheer up")? Why didn't you carry out your promise and insist on leaving? Leaving is certainly the most decisive and straightforward method among helpless options, but, heart, do you know the lonely person in her hometown who weeps, grieves, and suffers alone for you all day long? ... Mother still maintains her original severity and kindness. I wonder, will my cold heart ever be warmed again? ...</p>
<p>Last night, just as I was extremely empty, lost, and suffering alone, the postman brought me a heart that had been lost for half a year! How joyful and frantic I was! I unfolded this precious treasure with trembling hands, kissed it many times, and then held it up high and chewed on it slowly, word by word, with my sharpest eyes. I was afraid that after reading it all in one breath, emptiness and sorrow would come to attack my heart again, and this was indeed a rare and precious treasure that I had exchanged for something written with more than fifty times of blood and tears! How could I not cherish it very much? But, my heart! Isn't this gift that you brought me for the first time a little too cruel, making me even more painful and heartbroken? Because you said that ("From now on, we should start from saving the country and saving humanity to obtain our happiness and freedom"), and you also said that ("Because there is simply no other way than to use blood and flesh to fight for it"). Are you really implementing this? This gives me too much responsibility! Am I, such an ordinary woman, also worthy of you fighting for with your life? Doesn't this increase my sins even more?</p>
<p>Because of this, I wept all night. But in the end, I was moved and completely awakened by you. I understood your so-called ("cheering up") before. As you said, ("Under the layers of oppression of imperialists, the country has already lost its freedom, and is even on the path to national subjugation. What do we want this painful and incomplete happiness for?") Yes! We should ignite the torch of our lives, illuminating our revolutionary masses of action to fight against imperialists and all dark forces for the true happiness and freedom of our country and nation! We should hang our bright light high in this circle of darkness and sin. Heart, I am now your loyal comrade and also your sincere believer. I have decided to abandon everything to do our own thing, which is also the thing of all mankind. Heart, look.</p>

<h3>Lament for Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>— Qian Mengshao</p>
<p>North relies on Yuguan, south on Qin Island,</p>
<p>Natural defenses crafted by divine hand.</p>
<p>Once the pass falls, the island stands alone,</p>
<p>A roc's beak kissing clouds, a sight to behold.</p>
<p>Black clouds press down on the city's south gate.</p>
<p>Before the enemy is seen, soldiers flee in haste.</p>
<p>Who knew the foe numbered but fifty souls,</p>
<p>And those fifty were but wandering ghouls.</p>
<p>The general, for his complete security's sake,</p>
<p>Would not risk his army for a lone foray's sake.</p>
<p>From then on, east of Luo no Han banners flew,</p>
<p>As dusk in Zhijin saw dust and smoke ensue.</p>
<p>Alas, who held the northern gate's key?</p>
<p>Gathered iron defenses became this tragedy.</p>
<h3>Merchant</h3>
<p>— Runxi</p>
<p>We know that "(merchant)" is a term for someone who does business. Anyone involved in a transaction can be called a "(merchant)." However, what I'm referring to today are "(merchants who trade in knowledge)."</p>
<p>China doesn't have a small number of schools; Shanghai alone has many. Some are public, some are private. I don't have exact figures, but the term "(merchants who trade in knowledge)" has emerged. Let me give an example:</p>
<p>There's a private middle school in Shanghai called XX. I have a fellow townsman studying there. Each semester costs at least 300 yuan. Officially, the school receives 190-odd yuan, and the rest is for his personal use. They only have three or four classes a day, attendance is optional for students, and after three years, they give you a diploma. XX Middle School is co-educational, with about 100 students. They rent two small rooms in a three-story building on XX Road, XX Lane, for use as classrooms. So, naturally, there's no boarding; all students commute. It's quite a sight every day, with red and green clothing and different coats for each season, plus a small leather suitcase. They're always paired up on the trams, talking about Miss A or B, and answering Miss C or D. Love affairs happen too.</p>
<p>Alas! Everyone knows that Chinese education is bankrupt. Indeed, it is. Judging from the situation above, it certainly is. After three years, batches of graduates emerge, but society can't accommodate these people to serve or work diligently for society. So, they start their own XX schools and cultivate young people in the same way. The poor youths, during their youth, are complacent and careless (except for the good students), and enter these kinds of schools. This cycle continues year after year, burying countless young people! All those who run such schools, in Shanghai, do so with a business mindset, hoping to make some money to live on. They are truly "(merchants who trade in knowledge)" in name and in fact.</p>
<h3>Mass Life</h3>
<p>— Weng Tushen</p>
<p>As soon as I got up, I felt a bit dizzy. I thought I wouldn't pull the rickshaw today, but then I remembered that if I didn't pull for a day, my stomach would be in trouble, and I'd have to endure the scolding of my sallow-faced wife. So, I had to grit my teeth, drag my heavy feet, and pull the sixty-odd jin</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>rickshaw onto the smooth, wide road. Turning a corner, I was lucky enough to hear someone calling "(rickshaw)!" I pulled the rickshaw forward with all my might. When I saw the customer, I was shocked. It turned out to be a fat man in his forties, weighing about two hundred pounds, with two heavy pieces of luggage. It was daunting, but driven by the need to make a living, I couldn't worry about that. I asked the gentleman where he wanted to go. "(North Railway Station, two jiao)," the fat man replied proudly. I said, "Sir, you have so much luggage, how about three jiao?" "(No, two jiao. Take it or leave it!")," the fat man said angrily. I had to compromise to fill my stomach, so I quickly said, "Okay, okay." The fat customer jumped onto the rickshaw and told me to put his luggage on. Then he stepped into the rickshaw frame. I felt the weight was exceeding the limit. Helpless, I had to exert all my strength and start walking forward. Suddenly, a headache hit me, almost making me drop the rickshaw. I tried to endure it, but the pain made my limbs weak. I reluctantly ran slowly, while the fat man shouted rudely, "You pig! The train's about to leave! Run faster!" I was panting, my head was throbbing, and my legs were weak. The fat man was so unforgiving. I had to clench my teeth, endure the pain, and run towards what I considered my lifeline. With all my might, I finally reached my destination. I put down the rickshaw and carried the luggage down for the fat man. He jumped off the rickshaw, threw two jiao on the ground, and said harshly, "(You old bum, can't even pull properly!)." I couldn't argue with him, so I bent down to pick up the two jiao I earned with my life. I felt a darkness before my eyes, tripped over the rickshaw frame, and fell face first. When I woke up, I was in a bungalow at S Hospital on Qipu Road ("Charity Donation for Children").</p>
<h3>Research on a Shortcut Method for Bimetallism</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Wei's article in the 14th issue of this publication on another shortcut method for bimetallism. His ideas are unique and admirable, but it is regrettable that he did not explain the calculation principles, leaving readers only knowing that it is so without knowing why. Therefore, I would like to clarify this principle as follows for everyone to study and discuss whether it is accurate or not. 1) Since the exchange rate of standard silver dollars is set at 71.5, our research on shortcut methods is naturally limited to 71.5. Now, let’s try doubling 71.5 sequentially to get the following numbers: 1 x 71.5 = 71.5 2 x 71.5 = 143.0 3 x 71.5 = 214.5 4 x 71.5 = 286.0 5 x 71.5 = 357.5 6 x 71.5 = 429.0 7 x 71.5 = 500.5 8 x 71.5 = 572.0 9 x 71.5 = 643.5 The numbers obtained from one to six and eight to nine are all very complicated, only the number seven times is simpler. But if we multiply 500.5 by two again, we get 1001.0, which is even simpler. However, multiplying 7 by two is the same as multiplying 71.5 by 14, that is, 14 x 71.5 = 1001.0. This number still exceeds 10/10000. For the convenience of calculation, we change it to 1001, then the multiplier 14 should be changed to 1.4. According to this algorithm, we know that after multiplying the standard silver dollar number by 1.4, subtracting one thousandth of the number, we get its equivalent in silver dollars.</p>
<p>2) Further seeking practical proof, let's take one thousand taels as an example. Dividing it by 71.5, we get 1398.601. But according to the shortcut method, we only get 1398.600. We know that there is a difference of one li per thousand taels in silver dollars. Therefore, to obtain the exact number, we should add the digits in each place to the li place after calculating according to the shortcut method. Here is an example: How many silver dollars should be obtained for 1092 taels, five qian, and two fen of standard silver dollars?</p>
<p>Shortcut algorithm: 1092.52 x 1.4 = 1529.528 Second step, subtract one thousandth: 1529.528 - 1.529528 = 1527.998472 Third step, add the thousands place to the li place: 1528.000000 Result: 1528.000000 silver dollars This method can be called a shortcut, but one must understand the calculation principles before using it, otherwise, errors are easy to make.</p>
<h3>Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Pengnian</p>
<p>I, who shouldn't get sick, always get sick; frequently get sick. Since I'm going to get sick anyway, I might as well let it run its course, get even sicker, and go see King Yama in the Palace of Eternal Rest.</p>
<p>This day, I fell ill again, and this time it was very severe. I thought this illness might finally fulfill my wish to "die," but in the end, I was greatly disappointed. I didn't die; I gradually recovered. Even with such a severe illness, I couldn't "die." I realized that "dying" is also a very difficult thing!</p>
<p>Since I couldn't "die," and knew that I wasn't supposed to die yet, didn't have the qualifications to "die," I had no choice but to put the wish to die out of my mind and seek a path to "live." To find a way to live, I had to start fantasizing about everything:</p>
<p>("Gold goblets of champagne, 420,000... Tall Western-style houses, shiny cars, beautiful women, how happy! How blissful!") These fantasies swirled in my mind, playing out scene after scene. A sense of joy welled up in my heart, completely different from my earlier thoughts of death.</p>
<p>Suddenly, terrifying subtitles flashed before my eyes, rolling around in my sockets.</p>
<p>("Shimenkou is in dire straits... Sun Dianying's isolated army is fighting heroically, urgently awaiting reinforcements... Song Zheyuan's Great Sword Unit is courageous and fierce... Koukou three wins and three losses... Country XX suddenly sides with Japan...") At this moment, I revived the thought of death: ("Since I have to die, why not die on the battlefield! Dying there is a worthy death, isn't it? Isn't it more glorious than dying of illness? And surely I can fulfill my wish to die there!")</p>
<p>Various emotions surged in my heart. Just as I was thinking about death like a string of pearls, a car suddenly flashed before me, and the thought of death was broken again, reviving the waves of life.</p>
<p>("Gold goblets of champagne, 420,000... Tall Western-style houses, shiny cars, beautiful women, how happy! How blissful!")</p>

<h3>Shop Assistant Correspondence</h3>
<p>Editor Lao Bian:</p>
<p>My aunt is fifty years old this year. My uncle works as a bailiff in this town. For decades, their family has enjoyed great harmony. They have two sons: the eldest is currently working at the ○○ long-distance bus company, and the youngest is an apprentice at the ○○ printing company in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A few years ago: my uncle met a woman in this town and had a secret affair with her for two or three years. Later, he invited some relatives and friends to a restaurant and went through a few rituals, officially marrying her.</p>
<p>After that woman entered the house, she was initially peaceful. But after a month or two, she gradually revealed her true colors. She made things difficult for my aunt in every way: inciting my uncle to disagree with my aunt; alienating my cousin's wife from my aunt. She turned father and son into enemies, and husband and wife into opponents. Later, she instigated the father and son to cook separately, and did not care about her son's meals at all.</p>
<p>My aunt ate with my uncle, but only a bowl of plain rice: they hid things elsewhere to eat. Alas! All of this is difficult to describe in words, and my aunt can only swallow her grievances and tears!</p>
<p>Because of this, my aunt developed a disease, acting like a madwoman, losing consciousness, crying early and late, and not eating or drinking. Later, my eldest cousin tried every possible way to comfort her, and she got slightly better.</p>
<p>Alas! My heartless uncle, does he have no conscience? He listened to that woman's words and, around the Spring Festival, was going to move elsewhere. He recently declared to my father that he did not want my aunt to leave, but to continue living in the original place, only giving her a few dou of rice per month, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Because of this situation, my aunt's old illness has flared up again!</p>
<p>Now I will write down a few key points: (1) If my aunt lives with them, my uncle is unlikely to agree, and my aunt is unlikely to want to, because she cannot stand the abuse.</p>
<p>(2) If they live separately, but he only agrees to subsidize her with a few dou of rice per month, then what about spending money, clothing, side dishes, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, etc.?</p>
<p>(3) That is to say, please ask relatives and friends to persuade my uncle to subsidize my aunt, but he only nods yes and no, and then does not give it or gives less at the end of the month, then what will happen?</p>
<p>(4) That is to say, my aunt eats at my cousin's place, but my cousin earns very little and has to maintain a business himself.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The criminal law stipulates that those who commit bigamy shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than three years: and those who knowingly marry them shall also be punished in the same way. Wang Jun's uncle, of course, committed the crime of bigamy. As long as your aunt files a complaint, he will be guaranteed to be imprisoned; that woman will not be spared either. However, this illegal behavior only infringes on the rights of your aunt, and does not have a major impact on the general order of society, so the law stipulates that unless the victim files a complaint, it may not be prosecuted. Your aunt, in the past few decades, has had a great time following her husband, and I am afraid that she will not have such a determination to make him taste the flavor of iron bars. Therefore, it is difficult to solve this matter with law, not whether the lawsuit will end in tragedy, but whether your aunt can make this move. Therefore, we believe that the progress of this matter must be investigated to your uncle's strength. If he has a few money in his hand, then even though the lawsuit cannot be filed, he can hire a lawyer to warn him. Getting some money to enjoy his old age is also a good thing. If he does not have much property in his hand, then he can only let him go. Your aunt can only live with your cousin; although they are not rich, she can only take it as if he is dead, and she will have to endure it. He has already changed, let him mess around. If he is exhausted and knows to return, it will not be long before that happens!</p>
<p>Because of this, my father has also sought the opinions of many people. Go ask my uncle! The heartless him! There must be no answer that will satisfy you. Should we sue him? We also fear the fear that the lawsuit will end in tragedy. We can't do this, we can't do that. That's why I'm telling you about this situation, please think of a foolproof plan. I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Zhu Yiming</p>
<p>Correction: In my humble work (Easy Formula for Two Conversions of Silver Dollars) published yesterday, the last sentence "(Advance ten for eight, divide by fifteen)" is a mistake for "(Advance ten for seven, divide by fifteen)". Also, in the 12th line of the algorithm "(Advance nine for eight)" is a mistake for "(Advance nine for eight)". I am afraid that those who study it will be misled, so I am writing to correct it.

<h3>Time in a Dream (Continuation 34)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shoujuan</p>
<p>"(Since it's him, then you really should find a way to take care of him,)" Mrs. Liu expressed her approval of this principle.</p>
<p>"(He's probably a relative of ours, right?)" Wu Yuan spoke again. "(But, Dad, taking care of him also depends on the situation. Now is the critical moment for our Republic of China. Every citizen should have a full understanding. Our responsibility as university students is especially important. Not only must we be aware ourselves, but we must also persuade others. Wang Guodong's behavior is truly a black sheep. For the sake of the country's future and the patriotic movement, we must severely punish him as an example to many people! The fact that the traitor Hu Lifu was not shot is due to the corruption of the government and the昏庸 of the authorities. If we also let Wang Guodong off lightly, it would be the corruption of the academic community, the school authorities....)" Wu Yuan only said five words in the end and was embarrassed to say more, but his expression of clenching his fists and revealing his claws clearly told his father that he was really indignant about this matter.</p>
<p>Wu Yi lowered his head, quietly listening to his son's lesson, not even daring to look him in the eye. "(Don't get so agitated! Is your father's knowledge inferior to yours?)" Mrs. Liu saw that her husband was particularly meek and docile, while her son was acting arrogant and oppressive. She thought this reversed situation was too much and tried her best to correct it.</p>
<p>"(I'm not agitated,)" Just asking Dad what his intentions are? "(Where is Wang Guodong at this moment?)" Wu Yi's request to the student union to hand Wang Guodong over to him for safekeeping was not very well-founded. Not only Liu Ji and many other students were very suspicious, but even Wu Yuan felt that his father's statement of responsibility for safekeeping was very unreliable. Therefore, he was anxiously urging to know Wang Guodong's whereabouts without letting go.</p>
<p>"(Do you really have to know? Child!)" Wu Yi knew that the truth of the matter had reached the point where it had to be announced, but he still wanted to struggle.</p>
<p>"(Dad, why don't you explain it to me?)" Mr. Wu asked sharply. "(Okay, then I'll tell you the truth! Just now, I sent Wang Guodong to the station and let him take the train back to shanghai...." A two-hundred-pound incendiary bomb exploded in front of Wu Yi, and sparks flew everywhere. Wu Yuan, who was burning the most vigorously, jumped up like a little tiger who was starving in his stomach. Mrs. Liu could not control herself and immediately changed her face. Even the sixteen-year-old son, Wu Hao, because he had heard his brother tell the story of Wang Guodong before, also knew that his father's release of Wang Guodong was indeed not an appropriate measure, so he also cast a questioning gaze at Wu Yi.</p>
<p>When Wu Yi sent Wang Guodong to the station, he expected that he would be in trouble because of this. Of course, the small disputes in the family were also one of the troubles he had predicted. Therefore, he did not feel surprised at all at the hostile expressions of the three of them.</p>
<p>"(Please forgive me, like forgiving a passerby!)" Wu Yi's right hand was holding a bamboo cane, and his left hand was used to stroke his short beard. His attitude was as sincere as a death row inmate confessing his sins. "(Your mother knows! Wang Guodong is not someone else, but the son of an old friend of mine who has died. In the beginning, this old friend sincerely gave me invaluable spiritual comfort, and also loyally opened up a new path for me.... I dare not use other titles to insult her, I can only say that she was my life's only confidante, and Wang Guodong was her only beloved son! Logically speaking, now that Wang Guodong has come to Nanjing to study, in order to commemorate his ancestors, I should take care of him wholeheartedly and teach him, so as not to be unworthy of a closely related father; but, unfortunately,....unfortunately, I was simply selfish and self-interested, drinking all day long. Not only did I not take care of him or teach him, I simply did not even talk to him, so I am really to blame for Wang Guodong's present situation! At least I should bear half of the responsibility....!)"</p>
<p>The sincere repentance made him unable to hold back his tears. Mrs. Liu then let out a long sigh, immediately easing her personal hostile situation: But the young and vigorous Wu Yuan had not yet extinguished his anger.</p>
<p>"(But, Dad, haven't you always been the most able to protect the patriotic movement of the students? Now that this farce has happened, how can you be worthy of our Republic of China?)" Patriotism was active in Wu Yuan's body. He regarded this matter as more important than everything else, believing that the failure to punish Wang Guodong would inevitably cause the disintegration of all patriotic movements, and indirectly lead to the possibility of national subjugation. Therefore, he did not show any forgiveness for his father's emotional release of Wang Guodong.</p>

<h3>The Four Worst Phenomena in China's Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Yao Yinzhong</p>
<p>Since the advent of cinema in China, although it has only been a short time and cannot keep up with foreign countries, it has already been more than ten years. Speaking of its achievements, apart from some new tricks, there is really nothing satisfactory. But it is a rapid progress, a thousand miles a day. If we want to find the reason for this, it is generally due to the fact that the Chinese film industry does not exert its own labor. The most concrete and blatant manifestations are four types:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of cultivation in the manner of Chinese film actors has become a well-known fact. Those who have learned a little bit of superficial achievements, however, want to be complacent, and insist on adding the two words (Oriental) to the names of foreign already famous actors, in order to boast and exaggerate themselves. I remember that the American film child actor Jackie Coogan, because he heard that someone in China used his name as a title, his innocent heart felt unhappy. He said to people: (I don't know what this little friend is like, but if he does better than me, why use my name? If he does worse than me, why spoil my name?) This is really embarrassing for Chinese film actors.</p>
<p>(2) Love to praise the scene Chinese film actors, although they do not have cultivation, and lack acting skills, they all love people to praise their scene. Female actors are born better, and they like people to praise them as (stars), (queens). More, because people are praising them, they think that their skills have reached the highest level, and they are arrogant and invincible. So they stop here and stop moving forward. This is the most regrettable thing. You must know that the true acting skills of foreign actors all come from their own efforts, and are not created by people praising the scene.</p>
<p>(3) Plagiarism Plagiarism here refers to plagiarism of foreign films. Like a recently screened animal film, except for the actors, the animals in the exterior scenes are all plagiarized; although this is still only occasionally seen, once this trend starts, everyone will have to imitate each other, and the reputation of (domestic films) will fall into (Java). It is inevitable that it will be laughed at by the world. If this causes the aversion of foreign film merchants, it will be a great loss of face for the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>(4) Boasting The release of a film is for people to watch, and someone will naturally make a fair evaluation. But you can't over-boast yourself before the public release. If you think that this is not enough to attract the audience, you must also understand that even if they are attracted to watch your film this time and are disappointed, they may not dare to come and learn from you next time, wouldn't that be self-defeating?</p>
<p>Above I have explained the four worst phenomena in my country's film industry. The reason why my country's films have no achievements, cannot develop, and cannot obtain an international status like foreign films, is that these four phenomena are the steps of厲之: From now on, if my country's film industry does not want to seek expansion, does not want to be on par with foreign films, or even compete with foreign films, then it is already, otherwise it must reflect deeply on these four and start without hard work.

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of (The Secret of Madame)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The story is fictional, and the performance is excellent. Here, there is a fictional romance. A singer is loved by a young nobleman, and despite the strong opposition from the young man's father, the young man chooses to sever ties with his father and remain entangled with the singer. Soon after, the young man, troubled by financial difficulties and unable to gain his father's understanding, commits suicide. From then on, the singer raises his posthumous child and continues her dance career. Later, the young child is taken away by the grandfather. Many years later, during World War I in 1918, the middle-aged singer coincidentally meets her son. At this time, the son commits murder due to a love affair, and the mother, out of love for her son, resolutely decides to take the blame for him. However, due to errors in her confession, her son is ultimately implicated in the crime. Thus, the singer can only wait for her son to complete his sentence before reuniting with him.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is the best plot of a romantic novel, and of course, it is also very touching on the silver screen. Although (the troubles of a young man in love) may not necessarily happen in the real world, who among those prone to sentimentality can fail to be moved by a fictional story, or even admire the greatness of the protagonist's (character)?</p>
<p>Regarding the performance, it can be said that this play is indeed quite successful.</p>
<p>The introduction to the protagonist is only a short two scenes, and the second scene is a song and dance, which immediately meets the main conditions of a capitalist film. This must be attributed to the director's proper use of techniques. Afterwards, the first half is quite mediocre, and inevitably relies on (coincidence), but the portrayal of the protagonist's personality is very vivid. It wasn't until after the young nobleman's suicide that the whole play gradually improved, with one concise and quick scene following another without any slackening. Especially the several climaxes, thanks to the director's cleverness and the delicate performance of the leading actress, Irene Dunne, that the film reaches its best. Other scenes, such as the courtroom scenes, are inherently difficult to arrange, but the director is good at using close-ups, so it is not at all dull, and it becomes a highlight. Undoubtedly, the leading actress Irene Dunne's performance in this film is indeed very successful. From the moment her child is lost to the intense arguments in the courtroom, she is tense and realistic. Clearly, the second half is more colorful than the first half, perhaps because she is more suitable for portraying middle-aged women. However, it is not easy to have expressions and movements of two different ages in one film.</p>
<p>However, the supporting actors are mediocre. As for other aspects such as the set design, etc., two young Willies simultaneously fall in love with Jiao Jiao, and Jiao Jiao loves them both equally. This love triangle story takes place in (Peach Blossom Village). It is a new film in English dialogue, jointly produced by German Ufa and British Gaumont, and will soon be released in Shanghai. The main actors, Lily Harvey (center), Jack Hulbert (left), and Sonny Hale (right), all lack distinctive features. As for the meaning of this film, I don't want to elaborate on it here. Anyway, American movies, besides entertaining people or trying to win the praise of gentlemen and ladies, will not have other intentions that are worth our eager anticipation.</p>
<h3>Clara Bow's Patriotic Fervor</h3>
<p>— Xing Zhi</p>
<p>Clara Bow and her husband have been traveling in Europe for more than a month now. According to news from Europe, Clara has not bought even a single piece of underwear, let alone other items, during her trip to Europe, except for food. When absolutely necessary, she also makes sure to buy American-made products from stores. Before setting off, Clara had made many clothes in the United States, worth about 8,000 gold dollars. So, even though she changes her style of clothes every day in Paris, she still does not feel a lack. Paris' major merchants had expected a good business opportunity when Clara arrived in Europe, but they did not expect that Clara would be determined not to buy any non-American goods. People generally find this unexpected. However, French merchants do not resent Clara's patriotism because they did not have good business, and they respect Clara Bow very much.</p>
<h3>Review of (A Mole) BROTHER ALRAD</h3>
<p>— Lei</p>
<p>Originally, a slapstick comedy should not be judged solely by its laughable actions; on the contrary, it must have substantial content. If it only uses nonsensical actions to elicit childish laughter from the audience, then it will inevitably be subject to people's criticism.</p>
<p>Everyone who has seen (A Mole) will probably find its story very laughable. But strictly speaking, it is just a joke. Since this is the case, then the producer's purpose is only to make the audience laugh in the theater.</p>
<p>Regarding the story of this film, I don't think it is necessary to describe it here. Anyway, everyone who has seen it will know. Because the story takes place on a ship, there are only a few simple scenes, and the set design is of course not much trouble. A small number of characters move back and forth on the screen. If the plot were not constantly advancing, then it would definitely make people feel monotonous. At the same time, the actions of the protagonist, Gene Gerard, are not very skilled, and in many places, it is obvious that he is acting. However, a few shots do make people laugh. The supporting roles are even less noteworthy.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we can see the mediocrity of the director. If his skills were a little more flexible, I think that with such a relatively lively and tight structure, he could have achieved better results than this.</p>
<p>As for other techniques, they are all old methods being repeated. The sets are simple. The lighting is ordinary. Especially the sound recording, the chaos of that noise simply makes the dialogue incomprehensible. Also, since Monte Carlo is used as the background, there should be some pleasing scenes, but this was not achieved in the play.</p>
<p>In short, this is a mediocre slapstick comedy. Although the story of a slapstick comedy is difficult to be entirely reasonable, the entire performance is not good.</p>
<h3>Joan Crawford Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>— Sheng Hong</p>
<p>Hollywood once rumored that Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone's divorce had been officially finalized. Therefore, newspapers published the news of their divorce one after another, and radio stations also broadcast the report, causing a great stir. Joan Crawford, who is usually aloof from news reporters, due to the unfounded rumors spreading outside, which were nothing but groundless speculation, made an exception to meet with a news reporter, taking into consideration the feelings of the couple, to solemnly deny the rumors. "Sir," she said, "The rumors circulating outside are completely untrue. Franchot Tone and I have not had any disagreements. Sir, please believe me, these rumors are absolutely untrue."</p>
<h3>Film Novel Cavalcade (4)</h3>
<p>— Ne</p>
<p>Even Kit's best friend, Mrs. Margaret Harris, could not be as kind and loving as Ellen. But Margaret also knew Kit's suffering, and she often came to Kit's house to help Ellen relieve Kit's heart. Sometimes she would also bring her daughter named Edith to play with Kit's two boys.</p>
<p>Children... If it weren't for these children, how could these days, which feel like years, be endured? Edward and Joey, as well as the blonde and dignified Edith, and the petite and delicate Annie, Ellen's children were all chasing and playing together. Kit looked forward to news from her husband every day. Sometimes the postman would deliver letters from house to house, and Ellen would rush up to ask for news. She would return with her head lowered. Kit, hearing that there was no letter, would feel her heart wavering and shout repeatedly, "I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore." Ellen and Margaret would always be by her side, advising her, "No news is good news..."</p>
<p>Often, newspaper boys on the street would shout, "Extra edition!" Kit would immediately tell Ellen to buy one. When she saw that there was no particularly good news, Kit would return to her room with her head lowered, muttering to herself, "No news is good news." The more she tried to comfort herself, the more uncomfortable she felt in her heart. Margaret watched from the side, feeling truly sorry for her and also afraid.</p>
<p>One day, Margaret came up with an idea. She invited Kit to go out for dinner and a show. At first, Kit definitely refused, saying, "My brother is at Mafeking, and my husband is also fighting at the front lines. How can I go out and enjoy myself?" But Margaret insisted that she go. Kit had no way to disobey her, so she had to go out with her.</p>
<p>Inside that private theater, the two of them listened to the play. Kit temporarily returned to her original state. She rationally followed the actions on the stage, applauding or laughing, although it was obvious that she was trying to please Margaret. But in the middle of a boisterous comedy performance, the theater owner suddenly came to the front of the stage and raised both hands, asking everyone to be quiet. At that moment, Kit's breathing almost stopped. That instant was unforgettable for Kit for the rest of her life. She was as fearful as a prisoner about to die. She also saw the various characters on the stage, their faces covered with paint, standing stiffly by the stage: the performance also stopped; one by one, the audience opened their mouths, listening intently to the important news that the theater owner was about to announce, perhaps extremely terrifying news. In an instant, the theater owner's sharp voice shouted out! He said:</p>
<p>"Mafeking has been relieved!" (To be continued)</p>
