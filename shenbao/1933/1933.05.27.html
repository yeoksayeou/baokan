<h3>時評</h3>
<p>農村救濟聲中之根本問題梓</p>
<p>在華北風雲緊急中政府旣分其應付國難之心力對於農村復興委員會</p>
<p>之組織積極進行在商市蕭條中上海銀行界亦出其計劃維持都市繁榮之餘力集議籌設農村金融調劑委員會以期從事於農村經濟之救濟今日農村衰落之嚴重情况。與其急待救濟之形勢。顯然可見矣。</p>
<p>中國之農村。一方面受政治不良之影響一方面又爲經濟不景氣之潮流</p>
<p>所冲激。日漸衰落以成目下行將破産之情勢今政府懍於歲入全部之百分之七十五將不可恃。銀行界亦鑑於工商業根本所關之農業將　能維持共同謀救濟之方此不可謂非中國農村否極泰來之先兆也。雖然農村問題非簡單之問題因而其救。濟亦非頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚之方案所能完全有效此爲今日欲圖濟農村之各方所應明瞭者。</p>
<p>吾人並不反對頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚蓋頭脚疼痛而臨時設法救治之不失</p>
<p>爲一種治標之方法然。在同時必須有以治其本以從事於根本之治療目前救治頭脚疼痛之方劑。有農委會之討論有銀行界之籌議一部騐方新編不難即時出版。雖此種騐方之效力不可知。而參增减藥味。吾人可以不必今請言根本治療之問題。</p>
<p>吾人以爲今日中國農村之根本問題爲如何改造中國農業經營之特</p>
<p>質。據調查統計所示中國耕地面積爲十二億五千萬畝農民數則估計爲二萬萬九千萬人以此數之農民分。耕此數之耕地每一農民所得耕種之地。已甚有限而據民七農商部所發表之統計則全數農民之能獲得三十畝以上之耕地者。不及百分之三十一。獲得十畝以上者。約爲百分之二十七。其餘百分之四十二左右之農。民所得耕地均不滿十畝因此吾人可認識中國農村之特質爲。經營之零細此農業經營零細之特質即中國農村易於動摇之最大原因。時人喜言農村復興實則中國農村以前本甚衰不過外來侵害之力未强得勉强相安於衰弱耳。近年中國全部經濟之形。態變易甚驟潮流汹湧侵入農村而天災人禍更使耕地减少人民不能安於耕種農業零細經營之農村抵抗力薄弱不能禁此侵害破産之象遂以顯著倘使不即救濟破産之事實且可立見而救濟之道治標治根應同時並行治標以去其臨時痛苦爲主如政府及銀行界所籌議者是治本則在改造中國農村之特質使中國農業。由零細經營變成大規模之經營。以增加其對外來侵害之抵抗力。　　近來上海銀行界對於農村金融調劑之意見。或主集中力量。或主各自進行。議雖未决而已有投用其資金於農村之動機則甚明顯吾人以爲此種投資應以一部分用諸臨時之調劑一部則應以改造農村爲其目標此種改造農村之進行足以增加農村之生産力足以培養農村對外來侵害之抵抗力。另一方面。亦足以保障投資之安全也。</p>

<p>路透社二十五日日内瓦電　國聯行政院今日午後集議、因哥倫比亞與秘魯簽定解决萊的西亞爭端之協定也、顧問委員會主席南愛自由邦代表李斯特提出該委員會建議原文如下、本顧問委員會建議哥倫比亞與秘魯兩國政府應成立下述手績、以便實行三月十八日國聯行政院所通過報告書中所載之建議辦法、以免發生可使兩國關係更臻嚴重之事件、（一）哥倫比亞與秘魯兩國政府接受一九三三年三月十八日國聯行政院根據盟約第十五條第四節而通過之建議、並宣佈遵守此項建議之願意、（二）行政院須組織一委員團在三十天内抵萊的西亞、秘魯軍隊之在該處者、須於此委員團到時立即撤退、而此委員團以哥倫比亞政府之名義接收秘魯軍隊所退出之地方行政權、（三）爲維持其所管理之地方秩序起見、此委員團得自行擇調軍隊、並徴調其所認爲必要之任何其他份子、（四）此委員團有權得决定與其行使託管權、有關之各問题委員團之任期、不得超過一年、（四）雙方得將其所行之辦法以進行一九三三年三月十八日建議案第二條内所規定之談判者通知國聯行政院顧問委員會、而顧問委員會須即呈報行政院、（六）國聯行政院通知雙方、如爭議中之發展有在手續或實質之任何點上發生意見參差情事、行政院一經任何方面之請求、進備從中調停（七）哥倫比亞政府擔負委員團工作及其代管地行政之費用、（八）哥倫比亞與秘魯兩國政府旣接受上述提議、須發出必要調令、停止各種敵對行爲、並嚴禁軍隊越出本國近界、</p>

<h3>軍縮會討論海軍問題</h3>
<p>美日發生衝突日代表主張變更華盛頓倫敦條約英美表示反對</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國堅决反對變更華盛頓與倫敦兩海軍條約、無可通融、並不願討論日内瓦日代表所提另訂新約列入軍縮公約之議、日内瓦某某數國本有將華盛頓倫敦兩約列入軍縮公約之議、但日代表佐藤反對此事、主張另訂新約、蓋華盛頓條約規定五·五·三比率、倫敦條約對於輔助艦略加修改、成十·十·七之比率、但日本猶認爲未足、欲乘機要求增加日本之比率、故昨日提出修改兩約之議、美官塲聞此消息、立即表示反對、謂此兩約必須維持至一九三六年滿期時爲止、</p>
<p>某大使並謂美國所能贊同之修改祇有兩途、一爲延長兩約之生命、一爲再加裁減、據美國務院意見、以爲日内瓦討論軍縮旣已十分感覺棘手、今旣頗有獲致同意希望、不宜另添新問題、更使之複雜裁減海軍問題、不妨留待陸上軍縮與安全公約兩者解决之後、據海軍部表示、美國造艦旣尙未達倫敦條約之限度、邇來又痛事減縮、故對於再加裁減一層不成問題、即令成爲事實、在美國方面亦大半屬於紙上裁減、無損實質、此間官塲又信佐藤在日内瓦提出修改兩約之議、心中實懐有擴大美總統與石井談話範圍之意、因兩人將討論軍縮問題故也、但聞美總統之意、談話範圍當以日内瓦總委員會中現議事項爲限、而國務卿赫爾亦表示、所談將以前曾與他國代表討論者爲限云、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日俄代表今日在軍縮會議總委員會開會時嚴厲抨撃英國海上軍縮提議、俄代表謂此項提議不獨保存軍備充實國與未有大艦隊國間之離奇的不平等、且亦增進此不平等云、日代表佐藤稱、英國所提議之公約、殊無將倫敦與華盛頓兩海軍條約載入之需要、又稱、日本可忠實遵守此兩條約云、英代表艾登發言爲英國地位辯護、謂小海軍國原有之艦隊不須解除、而大海軍國之軍備則須縮減、英國所置海軍並未至海軍條約所規定之範圍、公約不獨造成軍備之縮減、且亦停止海上軍備之競爭云、美代表台維斯發言痛駁日代表所發倫敦與華盛頓兩海軍條約不須載入新公約之建議、非因其與日本義務有妨礙、但因世界輿論將受其影響也云、法代表瑪錫格里稱、軍縮會議宜以處理陸地軍備之同様方法處理海上軍備、主力艦宜減去一萬噸、以二萬五千噸爲最高限度、巡艦宜減去二千噸、以八千噸爲最高限度云、（二十五日路透電）　　（東京）外務省發言人評論日代表佐藤昨在軍縮會議所發之言論、謂其言表示日本保留在倫敦海軍公约期滿後要求更高比率之權、並有主張紙上平等之决心（二六日路透電）</p>
<h3>軍縮公約中海軍軍縮建議</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今日軍縮會議辯論之英國海軍軍縮建護、乃包含於英國草約中海軍軍備項下、其中説明華盛頓倫敦條約成立後所已實行之減縮與限制、繼乃提議將主力艦之停造推行於各種軍艦、惟意國如願增造、尙可造艦一艘、法國則自軍縮會議開始後、已於一九三二年開造軍艦登扣克號、又規定除倫敦海軍公約所列者外、不得再造裝八吋口徑砲之巡洋艦、其他建築、純以抵補者爲限、且當依守所厲行海軍條約中質的限制、至於德國、可脱除凡爾賽和約中海軍限制條欵之束縛、惟草約實際安定其海軍地位至一九三六年底止、一如今日、約中規定德國應遵守主力艦之停造、其他建造、亦純以抵補爲限、凡爾賽和約中質的限制、則經删除、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>「侵略國」界説</h3>
<p>英法又起爭執法主嚴格規定英反對</p>
<p>（日内瓦）波蘭與法國軍縮代表今日俱承認、英外次艾登所稱英國不贊成制定嚴格與、自働的侵略國界説一舉、殊出兩國意外、艾登表示、侵略國之界説、在協定上不妨極爲寛泛將來簽約國在决定時應以爭執所起之環境爲方針、並謂美國亦不主張嚴格之界説、將贊成英國立塲云云、事後法代表語新聞記者、法政府意見、認制定若干規則、明定侵略國界説、乃一切安全條約之核心、法國欲以此種界説爲裁减軍備之根據、故主張協定之内、當切實説明應當認爲、侵略之種種行動、苟有此種説明、則法國將覺可以切實工作矣、波蘭代表亦表示、波蘭深慮某種侵略、故贊成法國主張、並聞法波兩國代表主張、即集中軍隊於邊境、或在邊境作大操、亦當視作侵略行動、而加以禁阻、否則至少亦當認爲充分嚴重、有協商之價值云、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會議總委員會今日午後會、議時、英代表艾登對於保障委員會所定「侵略國」之界説表示異議、謂此種界説可資考慮、但不可形成何爲侵略國之固定的與嚴格的標準、在困難案中此種嚴格的界説、將受絶對的損害云、星期三日保障委員會規定侵略定義、爲（一）宣戰（二）不宣戰而出兵攻撃、（三）海陸空對於船隻或飛機之攻撃、（四）海軍封鎖口岸、（五）援助侵入他國之武裝團體（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本承諾不侵略中國？</h3>
<p>英認日未履行對美諾言</p>
<p>（倫敦）西門外相明日將對國會説明軍縮問題及四强條約形勢、一般人繼續希望西强條約可以簽字、但小協商各國在外交上之行動、足以减少樂觀、乃無可致疑之事、一般人希望法國能贊成四强條約、因四强條約、實爲防止德意團結之唯一妙法、英國政策之目標即在於此、關於安全問題、英外相原擬與法總理達拉策有所談論、現已從緩舉行、加之日内瓦方面有人要求修改海軍條約、以期裁减海軍、此項提案此間不甚歡迎、緣各海軍國已有縮减其海軍者、若其他各國不一律辦理、則業已縮减之國又焉能請其再行裁減乎、關於日本特殊情形、有人謂美國曾提出諾言、不在太平洋中戰略地點設置砲壘日本則承諾不攻撃中國以爲交換條件、英國人士以爲此項口頭約定、日本旣未履行、則日本軍縮代表佐籐所提減少噸數之建議、即難予以承認云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國會人滿爲患聆聽西門報告</h3>
<p>法代表言論引起極大疑慮德國撤回修正案至關重要</p>
<p>（倫敦）軍縮會議最近發展所引起之秘切注意、可於今日下院旁聽席之擁擠見之、英外相相西門昨乘飛機由日内瓦歸來、今日出席下院辯護英國軍縮草約、一般人咸欲聆其言論也、西門謂此草約乃</p>
<h3>軍縮會將暫結束耶</h3>
<p>（柏林）柏林各報之意見、皆以爲軍縮會議將暫行結束、休會至今秋、柏林地方報載日内瓦消息、謂該處謡傳軍縮會議休會之前、將通過關於保障及管理計劃問題之最後决議案、聞案中將載有條文、重行聲明禁止德國重置軍備、案中於軍縮之實際計劃、則舍而不提、日内瓦德人方面之意見、德政府决不致承認該决議案云、伏錫志報紀昨日日内瓦之海軍辯論、謂諸海軍大國意見顯相分歧、此種異見在世界經濟會議開幕之前、未必能銷除云、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>完全而有系統之計畫、並不閃避困難、苟</p>
<p>欲不再延擱應付此問題、則最有效力之方法無過於此、自此草約提出以來、衆所討論者皆不外乎此、觀此則此約之爲有效工具從可知已、美國態度殊可歡迎、但有須使各國了然者、必切實軍縮而後此約方有助於安全、美代表台維斯所稱、美國準備在某種情勢下修改戰時美國中立法一節、至爲重要、蓋美國已表示放棄僅作壁上觀之態度、且放棄其傳統政策矣、故苟發生戰事、而有一方面爲侵略國、則美國將切實運用其勢力、雖真正進步刻在日内瓦進行中、但擾亂徴象依然有之、今因未便指責某種特殊言論、但新近之議論、間有使世界爱和平之人發生極大疑慮者、希特勒之言温和適當、至可歡迎、但人若不承認言行不盡一致、則愚甚矣、德國在日内瓦提出之修正、足以破壞軍縮前途、但德方已撤回之、此亦可視爲重要事件云、英外相末稱、英國已大減其軍備、苟無一般協定、不能再減、英國已與美國表示參加協商之願意、以期增進安全、但英國不能担任如洛迦諾公約之更進一步的責任云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>小協約與波蘭對</h3>
<p>四强公約態度和緩</p>
<p>（日内瓦）自南斯拉夫外長葉夫的區發表宣言以後、一般人認爲可代表小協商各國意意、係各該國人表與法國外長彭古討論四强公約後、一種和緩表示、似此波蘭對於四强公約之見解、亦有轉變之可能、據聞法外長彭古擬星期日午後返已黎、即當依照衆議院外交委員會之希望、將四强公約談判情形提出報告、此公約在未經各國下府討論以前、未能簽字、總之在下星期末以前、不能</p>

<h3>華商紗廠</h3>
<p>今日起實行繼續減工</p>
<p>申新漙益工人爲賞工而怠工</p>
<p>紗廠緊縮理由以外商爲比例</p>
<p>本市存棉恐慌不足一月之用</p>
<p>本市華商紗廠、自本月廿二日減工期滿後、各廠因存紗未見減少、紡成之紗、勢必虧本、决繼續減工、同時實行緊縮、截減工人、取消每月賞工、致發生申新一廠曁漙益一廠工人之怠工、又本市棉花、存貨缺乏、聞已不足一月之用、兹誌詳情如下</p>
<h3>繼續減工</h3>
<p>華商紗廠總計二十八家、决繼續减工後、均採用星期六星期日日夜班停開即減工百分之二十三、今日禮拜六、爲繼續減工之第一日、各紗廠均照上項辦法實行、同時繼續緊縮、并各自宣告取消工人每月之賞工二天或四天、至於本市存紗、本月十五日裁止、爲十五萬包紗價較最低時每包漲十元、棉價較最低時每包漲五元、每三百六十斤棉花、紡成紗一包、即三與一之比、所以紡成之紗照現市仍須虧本、</p>
<h3>緊縮理由</h3>
<p>華商紗廠除繼續減工外、同時實行緊縮、其理由本市華</p>
<p>商紗廠纱綫錠子、總計一百十五萬七千二百枚、工人爲六萬五千一百四十六人、而日商紗廠紗錠子、總計一百四十五萬八千零六十枚、工人爲五萬一千一百零三人、以上爲民國二十一年春紗聯會之報告、但日商纱廠於二十一年冬曁二十二年春實行緊縮、大裁工人、以此比例華商紗廠錠子少工人反較日商紗廠多、故不得已緊縮</p>
<h3>棉花缺乏</h3>
<p>本市紗廠所用之棉花、爲湖北河南山東等處所産、曁美</p>
<p>國印度棉、而華商紗廠所用之棉花、以國産爲多、本市竟發生缺乏恐慌、國産棉、上海存花、不及二十萬擔、廠家存花亦不豐、産地存棉已不足一成、内地來源、因而缺乏、新花上市、至少尙須三四個月之後、至於本市所存美國棉花、曁印度棉花、亦僅二十萬擔、照全市六十一家中外紗廠之需不足一個月之維持故紗廠棉花發生供不應求之象、預料中外紗商、正在設法中、</p>

<h3>會商經過</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時十分、市府秘書長俞鴻鈞往工部局與總裁費信惇會晤、雙方即</p>
<p>行商談、約歷半小時、俞氏即行辭出、雙方意見、非常接近、聞工部局方面對我方保全主權之原則、頗有諒解、故昨日之初步談話、經過十分順利、</p>
<h3>談話原則</h3>
<p>昨日雙方談話之原則、係根據我方之主張、此項主張、即日前吳市長晋京與</p>
<p>外交實業兩部商洽上結果、昨日俞秘書長即依此原則、向工部局費總裁詳細説明、作初步洽商、惟將來如何解决之詳細辦法、由雙方分别研究、候下次會商時再行討論、</p>

<h3>俄使署參贊談</h3>
<p>中俄外交</p>
<p>東鐵事在俄京交涉商約談判未開滬平津領務即復救濟俄僑説無稽</p>
<p>國聞社云、蘇俄駐華大使鮑格莫洛夫、前因籌備恢復駐滬領署事宜、由京來滬、使署漢文參贊鄂山蔭、昨亦由亦來滬、記者特往訪問、與談俄領署事及中俄外交問題、兹誌其談話如左、</p>
<h3>中俄最近外交</h3>
<p>記者向鄂參贊詢問俄僞交易中東路事件、曁中俄商約據鄂氏答稱、關於中東路事件、中國國民政府之意旨、欲在莫斯科由駐俄顏大使、與蘇聯外交</p>
<p>當局交涉、故駐華俄大使署、對此事並無置喙、至中俄商約最近本可以開始商談、惟因大使來華未久、且大使署及領事署等内部諸事、尙未妥帖、故一時不及商談、惟於呈遞國書後曾一度作非正式之接洽耳、</p>
<h3>恢復領署事宜</h3>
<p>至此次大使由京來滬、係爲領事館務而來、其返京日期、當在一二星期以後、現本埠領署、日内即開始修葺、約一月左右可以竣事、待修竣後、即</p>
<p>行開始辦公、實行恢復駐滬領署、現參贊巴而可夫奉命兼任平津總領事、亦擬即將天津之舊領署恢復、至南京大使署之房屋、雖已覓定二所、惟是否敷用、尙未可知、</p>
<h3>調查俄僑不確</h3>
<p>嗣記者復詢日前報載調查俄僑之説、是否確實、據鄂氏答稱、蘇俄僑居在滬者、據鄂氏</p>
<p>答稱、蘇俄僑居在滬者、總數不過二百人左右、俱一一有詳細册籍可稽、無調查之必要、且</p>
<p>蘇俄僑民之來華者、俱有正當職業、或爲政府派遣來華者、全無失業之事、更無救濟之必要、至於其他俄人在滬、雖爲數衆多、然俱爲失去國籍之人、蘇俄駐華大使、對於此輩失去國籍之人、根本無調查之權、故外傳大使來滬調查僑民救濟失業等詞、俱不確實云云、</p>

<h3>渝蓉暫定爲一航空區</h3>
<p>中國航空公司滬蜀線之終點本爲成都、</p>

<h3>滬日商連日開會</h3>
<p>研究關税對策</p>
<p>自認欲反對而無法律上之根據徧要胡閙又欲藉武力肆行恫嚇</p>
<p>華聯社本埠息、滬日商對我新關税法、甚不滿意、棉紗布業者尤甚、竟誣爲變相抵制日貨之辦法、連日開會議研究對策、棉布業公會、昨日下午六時、在虹口日本俱樂部召開委員會、對日本綿纱布出口同業公會及大阪綿布商同盟會各發電報、求其帮助、昨日、討論結果、各委員均謂、中國旣有關税主權、在法律上並無抗爭之根據、不過從情誼上、求中國政府反省而已、其實我國之關税、遠不及日本之苛酷、日人尙且不知足、欲向我政府刁難、擬定建議案八條、向上海總領事館、駐滬商務官辦事處及商工會議所提出、其内容節録如左、（一）新税率雖是對各國一律平等待遇、數目最多之日本重要進口貨、所征税率最高、（二）英國之高級貨與日本劣等貨、受同等待遇、甚爲不合理、（三）中國雖説目的在提倡國産及增加財政收入、其實專爲抵制日貨甚明、（四）此種税率、若不修改、不但綿紗商要受打撃、住華日商工業、均受影響結果、日本之對華貿易、將從此衰退、（五）此問題比上年之滬變更嚴重、解决不得其法、或要發生可怕的事案、（六）華北停戰將成立、而因關税問題、和平前途、恐轉爲暗淡、（七）政府須了解同業者之重大决心、解决此問題、（八）由滬商工會議所電萬國商工會議所、求貨援助、謀圓滿解决之方法、並請外務省予以同様之援助、</p>
<p>慣用槍桿做生意之之日人、明知抗議無法律上之根據、徧欲藉武力恫嚇、求不正當之利益、日商若研究華貨在日本所受之關税、自能明白日商之行爲、屬於胡閙、日商竟不出於此、今日再召開駐滬日商各業公會代表者開會、擴大其無謂之運動云、</p>

<p>稱鴻生係屬親生、遂飭雙方夫婦與鴻生冋往真茹法醫檢騐所、依法檢騐、經該所醫生檢騐血族、詎結果顧阿二之妻·馬大興之妻·之血、皆與鴻生之血相同、而馬大興之血、則不能混合、惟顧阿二聲明此子係其妻與前夫所生、故彼不能參預、致難以證明鴻生究爲誰子、於是始採用逐部拍照核對方法、將各人之五官四肢逐一拍照、詳細核對之下、深覺鴻生頗類顧妻、遂據實呈報特院、昨日午後、錢推事開庭續訊終結、認定鴻生係原告之子、遂當庭宣决被告略誘罪處徒刑三月、緩刑二年、鴻生交自訴人領去、馬大興並贈償自訴人損失洋一百元、惟馬聞判、聲言不服、謂將上訴、而馬妻則見鴻生被顧阿二抱去、亦號啕大哭不已、錢推事乃將判决理由詳細指述、並將法醫檢騐之各點及所攝照片異同各點、一一發交雙方辯護律師閲看、</p>

<p>放、一面往進步調查、據云確有薛·闞·二人到來</p>
<p>、住宿一宵、惟已遷居恒通旅館、楊探又往恒通調查、則薛等又已他往矣、蓋闞消息靈通、自單被拘後、闞已知事敗露、於十九號、將薛女領往胡家木橋友人處暫寄、已則向薛　得金銀衣服、變價化用、至此薛女亦已覺察所遇匪人、乃於當晚深夜十二時許、乘隙逃出、茫茫大道、不知歸途、被巡街華捕所見、以時在深夜、</p>
<h3>萬籟俱寂時</h3>
<p>何來青年女子、獨在街頭躑躅、乃將帶入嘉興路捕房、經捕頭</p>

<p>被領至胡家木橋友人處住宿一夜、翌日乘隙逃出、被捕帶至捕房、我所有衣飾金戒、均被闞在進步旅館騙去云云、詰之被告供稱、十六號薛女着賢生來喊我、謂現聞其父母欲將伊以四百元之身價、賣往漢口、請我帮忙、自願隨我出走、其時薛女并無衣包且足穿拖鞋、由我在進步旅館代購肉色跳舞絲襪一雙、計洋一元九角相贈、對於與薛女相奸、則承認不諱、末由庭上指定律師爲被告辯護之下、吳推事當庭判决被告闞記生連續奸淫未滿十六歲女子、處有期徒刑五年、裁判確定前　押日數、以二日抵徒刑一日、</p>

<p>敎育與社會</p>
<p>—江西劉恨痕君來信—</p>
<p>現在的敎育，只有有錢人，可以享受，貧苦</p>
<p>者，多被排斥；尤其窮鄉僻壤的農人的小孩子，簡直没有受敎育的機會，這種畸形的現象，誰都承認的，並不是我偏見的話。</p>
<p>先生，我的故鄉也是一個窮鄉僻壤的的農村，</p>
<p>未蒙敎育當局的青睞，設立國民學校，可憐一百多個天真爛漫的兒童，都成無書可讀的文盲，現在的我，想在故鄉，創辦一個初級小學，（内分四班敎員三人經費約八百元）救濟還班失學的兒童，但是經費毫無着落，普通籌措學校經費的方法，不外向外募捐，提救公産，收領公地等等，向外募捐嗎？這件事情，全仗交情廣究，才可成功，我是一個寡朋鮮友的青年，交情異常狹小，這件事情當然不必去談了，提撥公産嗎？要有勢力的人，才可做到，我是一個無力的青年，並且與當地的政府，亳無聯絡，這種事情，當然又不能實現了，收領公地嗎？我鄉的荒地荒山，殊爲寥寥，並且不易收領，卽使能够收領，非費相當的財力，不能獲得生産，這種望梅止渴的事情，也算無濟於事了，除此以外，只有自已拿出錢來，無奈我又是一個窮漢，那裏有錢來創辦學校，若從事實上的觀察，非辦不可，舉手創辦，範圍决不能縮小，經費又無着落，像這様的事，實在是難乎其難，先生我爲着這個問題，想了許久的時間，問過許多的學者，都没有得到良好的辦法，久仰先生，見識超羣，善釋疑難，特來請敎，望速指示我吧？</p>
<p>答：「窮鄉僻壤的農民的小孩子，簡</p>
<p>直没有受敎育的機會」這是現在的畸形社會的現象之一，若果你只想從這種現象本身而不從牠的背後動力去找解决，那是根本没有希望的。在現社會的政治經濟的狀况之下，不説是你，旣無錢，又無勢，想到鄉間辦學，是比登天還難，即使你的學校辦好了，於現在的整個的社會的不平現象又有何補？我説這話，不是給你「冷心丸」吃，而是要你用社會學的眼光，更深一層地去追求，去找出路—如果像你這様地到鄉間去辦學，不是我們不贊成，我們也實無術爲君劃策—</p>

<p>無線電展覽特刑　引言  記者　　或問曰：寇深矣、國危矣，無綫電非當務之急，申報館何爲而有展覽會之舉？應之曰：誠然。然而無線電發明於世界大戰以前，盛興於大戰方酣之際。在戰時，歐洲各國非皆在危急存亡之秋耶？何無線電之獨能爲人研究利用也。　　無線電雖非砲艦，飛機，坦克車可比。然於國防及交通敎育上之重要，固已盡人皆知。年來我國研究者旣日漸衆多，播音事業亦日見發達。此實良好之現象。吾人决不當以國難日亟之故，掩旗息鼓，阻其進展。而正宜乘國人激於義憤思圖報國之際，提倡而推奬之。設以此而能引起國人研究學術之興趣，則將來之效果，恐較目前伏處室隅，空言抵抗，勝過萬萬也。　　我國無線電事業雖漸見發展、然而機件用品鮮能自製，使用常識亦未普及。如何可以促進自製機件灌輸常識於一般民衆，恐又當以展覽會之舉爲最有效果，至所以邀請外商參加者，則以他山之石可資攻錯耳。　　最後本館謹向參加展覽會陳列之中外各商家及借供展覽會會場之湖社，致誠摯之謝意。無線電展覽會祝辭  曹仲淵　　在中國無線電工業發展中，這個展覽會可算是過渡時代新興工業一個有意義的舉動，尤其是著名的申報來提倡，確值得吾們去參加和頌揚。　　無線電播音輸進中國，祇有十五年工夫，回溯十年以前和今日比較起來，真有不少的進步，這就是：　　（一）電台數目在民國十一年的時候，祇有上海南京路五十號新孚洋行一家現在增加到七十多家。（二）電力從五十華脱增加到一千華脱（上海）乃至七萬五千華脱（南京）（三）節目數量從三行增加到數十行</p>
<p>節目内容從極簡單鄙俗的進步到敎育文化的播音時間從下午五時以後三數小時增加到全日全夜播音工作從消遣無謂的進步到募捐救國（四）收發音機及其另件從舶來品發展模彷自製的（五）無線電刋物在十年以前没有一份現在已有多種了以上五項最值得注意的，祗是第四項，因爲這是科學工業發展的萌芽有關國計民生的。　　每年八九月的時候，我們若到倫敦Ｏlympia或是柏林Ｋaiserdamm去參觀他們的無線電展覽會，陳列品數量之多，真要看得目亂眼花，精疲力盡，最可怕的是他們祇是單獨提倡他們自已的東西，全塲數百家竟然找不出一件東西是舶來品，並且還在會塲到處張貼着觸目驚心的圖畫和字句，説是Ｂritishmake，以示真正的國貨，德國比較地没有英國那様尖刻，荷蘭飛利浦也得分占一席之地，但是遠地排列在大會門牆之外，不能混雜在大廳之中，這顯然又有賓主之分，所以法國在一九三○年籌備開萬國無線電展覽會的當兒，單獨拒絶德國去參加，這裏除了排擠外貨之外帶有外交政治的含義。　　看了英德展覽會，再來看這個展覽會，在下有以下三種希望（一）我們無線電工業現在是很幼稚的，有西洋貨來給我們做榜様，我們是很歡迎的，諸君莫説今年國貨年，不必去提倡西洋貨。（二）無線電工業在西洋各國因爲有專利權及貿易圈的限制，又因爲有科學　　敎育的助成，努力進取的功績，他們俱能獨出心裁，不絶創造，我們現在尙無專利權的束縳，應該趕快去仿造，無須誇口説發明。（三）西洋科學工業發達的國家，雖是學者，也不免互相批評，互相攻讦訐，　　我們現在粗淺的可笑，應該彼此集中精力經濟合作起來，纔有希望。敬祝吾國無線電工業發展無量。參觀申報無線電展覽會記  ＶＴ　　申報爲提倡無線電事業，促進國人對於無線電的認識，及激起研究興趣起見，持於五月二十四日至二十八日假座北京路貴州路湖社，舉行「申報無線電展覽會」五天。於五月二十四日上午九時開幕。今日已爲展覽會第四天·記者逐日往觀。爰將詳情記叙如次：會塲一瞥　　「申報無線電展覽會」會塲在湖社下層，正門臨貴州路，門額圍一美術化的一申報無線電展覽會」布幔。未至場即聞有美妙音樂。蓋會塲正門裝置飛利浦公司七五瓦特大擴聲器，發聲之宏大，雖遠在南京路亦能聲聞。入門，門左爲中華無線電研究社陳列各種自製無線電零件，及自製三管短波收發報機，蓄電器，廣播無線電機，電阻器，繞綫機，刻字機等。門右爲華昌無線電器製作所，陳列自製各種國貨電阻，開關，栅極帽，插頭，及廣用開關等。　　場中計陳列三家飛利浦無線電洋行，陳列各種本牌最新式收音機，擴音機，傳聲器，真空管等。康茂無線電行陳列該行所經理之尤愛斯牌收音機，裴爾登牌電線、開勒牌真空管及吉而文牌史德華牌等各種高等收音機，港粤滬華美電器行，陳列其所經售的各種無線電收音機及零件。　　場裏左爲英商馬可尼無線電公司，陳列各種本牌收音機，旅行用手提收音機，軍用手摇發電機等。右爲建華無線電公司，陳列各種自製無線電零件，電池，自製收音機傳聲器，及無線電應用書籍等。（一）無線電展覽會會塲外景徐天率攝　　場左兩室：一爲惠勒公司，陳列其所經理之鷹王牌各種收音機。一爲利達公司，陳列其所經理的百樂牌奇異牌及開朗牌各種收音機，揚聲器，傳聲器等。場右一室，爲大華無線電公司，陳列自製長短波收發報機，手摇發電機，及德國希奈克斯牌固定電容器等。全上海最優最新之收音機及各種零件盡網羅於一室。巡塲一週惟覺光彩奪目。樂聲悦耳。令人樂而忘返。展覽盛况　　「申報無線電展覽會」開幕以後，絡續到會參觀者，平均每日五千餘人，但因會塲狹小，甚爲擁擠，在場任招待者爲申報廣告部秦熹敏君及各陳列商家特派員等，均異常忙碌，導引參觀，解釋種切，務使參觀者滿意而歸。然而時光飛逝，此千載一時的盛會，祇剩今明兩日，預料此兩日中參觀者必更形擁擠也。二會場内景飛利浦洋行陳列處觀感一斑　　記者厠身會場，親聆參觀者對於各種陳列品的，種種批評，不勝枚，摭拾一二，以見一斑。對於所陳列的國貨如中華，如華昌等的出品，幾乎一至讚美，中華自製零件，不亞於舶來品，華昌所製插頭開關栅極帽等係完全國貨。故塲中有作「中國畢竟並不後人」的豪語者。　　對於自已裝製的機件，如大華，如建華如中華等的長短波的收發報機等，參觀者均謂「簡直和舶來品一様。」　　對於其他各種陳列，讚譽各有不同：有讚譽馬可尼的旅行用收音機的便利者，有讚譽尤愛斯收音機的指度盤的佳良新頴者：有讚譽百樂小傳聲器的價亷物美（祇售十二元）者，有讚譽飛利浦調音線圈的構造精緻者，有讚譽鷹王牌開朗牌吉而文牌等各種機件的式様美觀者：：凡此種種，無非是一片讚譽聲。　　收音機中式様華麗偉大，宜於高廳大厦中裝置者有利達公司所陳列之十四燈機。巧小玲瓏，宜於書房寢室中收聽者，有斯德華之四燈機。該機所占地位不盈一尺，且交流直流可以通用，聲音極爲優美。至聲音宏大，則首推ＵＳ九燈機，音量開足時在二百碼外可清晰聽聞，於公共場所裝用最爲適宜。此外鷹王牌十二燈機其低音部之發音真切響亮。馬可尼落地式收音機具有自動唱片，凡換片，開唱，停止，均係自動。實爲塲中之一特色。飛利浦公司之六燈機三會場内景之一康茂無線電行陳列處　　，將内容拆開，任人參觀。其構造之堅固，一目了然，總之會場中之陳列品皆爲市上最佳之出品，真有美不勝收之槪。故蒞塲參觀者莫不心滿意足，在場中立購者每日亦頗不少云。</p>

<p>無線電之將來  左企　　近年以來無綫電—尤其是無線電話—是在不絶地迅速地進展着，舊的機件日漸淘汰，新的式様的有發明。收音機的收音靈敏，管理簡便，費用省廉：播音機的效力增强，播程遠大：以及真空管擴聲器等的改良，短波及超短波的採用，這些都是比較重要的成績。他如廣播事業的發達，無線電視的成功，無線電遥遠控制的發明，更足證明無線電效用的廣大與乎發展的神速。　　目前如是，此後更將發展至若何程度？這倒是有趣的問題，試加推測如下：　　（一）無綫電話　　收音機價廉物美，每一家庭至少置備一具，像現在的電燈一般。私人自裝播音機大爲盛行，我們得與遠方朋友自由通話，像現在電話一様。　　真空管都用無絲者，且數目儘量減少，感竟屏棄不用而效率則愈增大。收音機都裝有自動音量調節機關。袖珍收音機的大流行，警察及旅客等皆隨身携帶，像我們現在佩戴手錶一様。　　不僅短波無線電已被普遍應用，而波長在十公尺甚至一百公尺以下的超短波亦將大顯神通。播音電台雖激增，而電台間干擾問題則已完滿解决。秘密無線電話必將盛行，廣播節目則由娱樂的商業的方面擴充到敎育的政治的方面去。因全程收音機（能收全世界播音）之盛行，國際播音隨之活躍。世界語Ｅsperaoto或被採用爲國際播音的公用語。　　（二）電視　　電視（Ｔelevision）在目前尙未脱離實騐時期。但在最近的將來，它將從實騐室裏搬移到市場上，家庭中去。電視廣播台（播影台）將依次設立。家庭所備收音機大都附裝收影機，隨時收看各種電視節目（如電影表演競技等）。至最後播影機已發展至實用地步時，個人即可自備播音播影機，與遠地親友對面談話—　　至於電視技術方面的進展，將傾向於超短波及隂極線管（ＣatboderayＴube）的採用，前者可以避免電台間的干擾，擬者使所傳影像明細，能與現在的電影媲美。電視機件趨於簡單化，代價低廉，其最後成功將棄分像法而不用。有色電視亦爲最後成功之一。　　（三）無綫電控制　　用無線電遥遠控制飛機及船舶，現時早已試騐成功，將來必能見諸實行。此外，在建設方面，無線電將被用以控制各種日用器具，如電燈開關，窗門等，各種製造機械，各種交通信號，各種安全裝置。在破壞方面，無線電將被用以控制槍砲的射撃，爆炸物的轟發，飛機戰艦坦克車的行動等。此層我們當然不希望它實現，因爲無線電已爲人類服務了數十年，以後自然希望牠仍繼續作有利於人類的事情。此外，無線電控制聲音（無線電樂器）將漸次進步而成爲一種普通的娱樂。無線電控制燃燈，及輸送電力，亦或有實現的可能。　　總之，無線電在今日尙在少年時代，此後正方興未艾，前程無量。［萬能］二字，無線電誠當之而無愧！對於中國無線電事業之希望  潘仁榮　　登高而望，縱横交錯者，收發天線也。入室而聽，丁冬悠揚者，説書歌唱也。由前者觀之，中國無線電事業似已臻於隆興昌盛之域，就後者思之，則不過畸形之發展而已。資産階級多一享樂之機會，商人市賈多一生財之大道，而大多數勞苦生産之民衆不但無緣問津，反間接受着經濟的剥削，其能真正利用於國防文化交通等事業方面者實屬無幾。影響所及，洋貨暢銷，民族經濟爲之日蹙，此識者所引爲疾首痛心者也。然而吾人不能因噎廢食，無綫電本身確爲有益身心者也。人羣之文明利器，要在吾人之能善用之而已。今請將我人今後之希望分述於后　　（一）求其普及　無線電乃正當娱樂之一，清歌妙曲，又富有藝術欣賞之價值，惟病其不能普及耳。求其普及，及關於人民經濟能力，如今一真空管之微，價已十金，實非一般購買力所能勝任，補救之道端在地方政府曁敎敎育機關擇人烟稠密之區裝設大擴聲器，並由國營工廠大量生産（Mass　Ｐroduction）各種機件以低價出售，更使廣播電台平均分佈增加電力以期用廉價簡單之收音機即能收聽，凡此種種，不勝枚舉。　　（二）充分利用，歐西先進國家以無線電利用於國防文化等事業，其成績，實足驚人。我國近年來亦有長足進步之象。然今後最應注意者爲培植人材，發展重工業，以謀原料問題之解决，對内注重政敎邊陲諸項問題，對外注重國際宣傳，宣慰僑胞，光大國體，又以我國幅員之廣，尤宜互相連絡，一呼百應，創設無線電網。餘如保障枝術人員之生活安定，亦頗重要，則應由政府推進之。　　（三）關於提創研究方面　無線電之進步能若此其速，業餘家與有力焉，歐戰時彼等出其平日刻苦用心所得之結晶，加入軍隊，效命祖國。至今日乃有此盛况。我國研究者近亦不少，但能有卓著之成績者實不多覯。大多數且以享樂爲目的。國難日深，當思變易途徑，致力研究矣。他如無線電控制砲位，駕駛飛機坦克車，均係可能之事，我人尤宜加以注意一方政府學校固應力加提創，奬勵發明與出版，供給圖書儀器統一譯名，指定試騐波長，建設研究環境，在研究者亦宜發起相當组織，共同研究討論。如消費生産合作團體之創設，於購買力上，亦不無不補也。無線電機件器小而情近於女子習性，故對女子研究似宜多加提創。至於商家與工廠，尤望其出品改良，售價低廉原料儘用國産，電燈炮廠亦能設法仿造真空管，則一普通收音機即可無須仰給洋貨矣。此外，如實行關税保護政策，減輕國貨流通國内税率，嚴密督察廣播秩序，使播音臺散佈四郊，以清擾亂，利用收音機實施農村敎育，皆屬必要之舉。准此而行，則其結果又豈特中國無綫事業蒙其利益而已。國貨年談無綫電  瑛　　請諸君檢查一下，究竟有没有純用國産原料製造的無線電收音機？　　無線電最大的工作是宣傳，是廣播，那末，要求廣播宣傳的工作有效，第一要緊的是在收音機數目的增加，現在「無線電民衆化」的聲浪一天較一天高起來，要「無線電民衆化」，更不能不注意於收音機的普遍。但真可惜，好多提倡無線電的人，尙不知道我們中國至今還不能用自已的産物來造一座收音機—僅僅一座礦石收音機都不能造。耳聞目見，精巧的，簡單的，都是外國貨，這是很可憐，很危險的事—　　提倡「無線電民衆化」，故力求收音　　機的激增：但是因中國不能自給的緣故，我們現在要買一座收音機，不啻就是去送許多錢給别的國家，從這點看來，我們要提倡「無線電民衆化」。不得不先從事國産收音機的製造，不去提倡國産原料的製造，而去宣傳無線電的功効，簡直就是勸中國人把金錢向外國送。　　無線電學日新月異，現在是最新的，過幾天更有好的發明出來：老舊的方式，都是落伍的古董！譬仿，現在某國發明某件，功效比現在用的大。我們急忙買了來，研究，試騐，確定，實用。不知一些時後更有好的發明了來。就算我們的頭腦清楚，專揀最好的用：你們發明什麽，我們買什麽，這金錢靡費的額子也就可驚了—　他們是日日不斷的研究着：我們等他們發明了，才照他的方法寳用。我們用了，他們又有更好的：在實用，學術，工技上都斷不及人家的：功効當然差遠了。退一步説，我們都學會了：工作同他們一様的好，一様的有效率，這不過可以得到人家讚你一聲：「會用外國貨！」		現在無線電應用的機件方面，漸漸的有自造的了，這是深可慶賀的—可惜有一部份的人常應用「國貨」字様來做廣告，用外國原料，冒充國産，這種行爲是可惡亦可憐的—　　我們知道，要收音機普遍，牠的價格一定要很賤的，牠的構造又要簡單，効力又不能太壞，對於這此礦石機和單管回授式是極合宜的—等到中國能自給這二種收音機的原料時，重管式全付可以不出二十元，礦石機則在五元内。這是説連一切附件都在内的。　　對於播音方面，當然也是以求其普遍爲要。民衆化的主點，在多，在普及。中央已有一個大電台，所以我們不必再花許多的錢來造十基瓦以上的大電台。中國的國土雖遼闊，我們利用短波的特性和中繼的方法，邊境和邊境的通訊是没有困難的。此外多造中電力的電白，則於民衆方面，宣傳方面，研究方面，和政冶的開發統治，文化的溝通，交換都有較大的利益，同時越洋通訊，普通已可應用，在日本，他們充分利用無線電網的連絡，廣播方面，十基瓦以上的，有數十之多，五百瓦的最多，（編者按，日本因國土狹長，建造大電台極不經濟。我國情形與日本不同，反以建造大電台較爲經濟。不知作者以爲然否？）這是最適宜的廣播電力，經常維持費是很省的，他們的國土雖小，但他們國内無線電的發達和普遍，與我相去，何啻天壞—他們孜孜不斷研究，固然可佩，最該學的，便是他們連絡的精神—　　我們要求「無線電民衆化」，一面使中電力發電台增加，一面要注全力於礦石收音機和單管收音機的製造。我們有天然極好的礦石，—自然銅，有出名的磁器做絶緣物。雲南省有許多銅礦：可供我們做銅線的原料，在普通收音機方面，銅線製造不精：粗細不匀，無甚妨得，其絲包或紗包，極粗或極細的，一時可以不必具備，只求一接收廣播範圍之礦石機成功而已。有銅線後，天地線及聽筒皆可自给，更可用未製各種變壓器。電容器已有自製，但是鋁是外貨，深望有用中國的銅來造！如此看來，則無線電網成功不難，難在「純粹國貨」。　　寫到這裏，我夢想到將來無缐電網成功後，每省至少有十個十基瓦以上的廣播電台，五百瓦的，至少有十個以上。收音機：每家至少一座。—都是用國産品製造的。洋貨絶跡：中國貨供給全球使用。諸君不要以爲我説傻話，只要「做」，終會成功的！而且只有「做」才會成功—你不信，請看：日本，蘇俄，德國，土耳其，和意大利。他們「做」的結果！</p>

<p>業餘家應負起責任來  蔡光華　　▲▲………………▲▲　　我們覺得很奇怪，這幾年來，無線電在中國的進展，比任何東西都快。這自然業餘研究家也有很大的功績。所謂業餘家，就是將無線電作爲職業以外的消遣與研究的人。這種人，在美國最多。中國近幾年來，也産生不少。今後中國無線電事業的發展，就全靠業餘家能够負起相當的責任。</p>
<p>業餘家應該注意的幾點是：　　（一）對於自身應負有責任一，須力圖上進—業餘家對於無線電，應當取研究的態度力求有所發明：成功時切勿驕矜，失敗時勿灰心。　　二，須有道德心—業餘家收得政府不准公開發表的電報，應當保守秘密：收得各種呼救電碼，應當立刻設法援助，不可取旁觀態度，業餘電臺，不可有意騷擾空際，應當時有服務社會國家的準備。　　三，須有業餘精神—業餘研究，不可以牟利爲目的，業餘電臺，應當多播學術演講，不可專播娱樂節目。　　二對於社會應負的責任一，發展中國無線電工業—業餘研究家，應當在研究之餘，指導國産製造廠出品的改進，自已有所心得，應當貢獻給大衆，這様中國無線電工業的前途，才有希望。　　二，灌輸知識於一般民衆—無線電事業在軍備和交通上，都有相當的價值。可是，無線電在中國，究竟算不得普遍，所以，灌輸無線電知識於一般民衆這件事，實爲當今業餘家最大的責任。　　今日中國無線電事業，那様神速的進展，固然是一個好現象，可是，前途的暗礁却還多着，國産品的稀少，中文無線電書籍的缺乏，在在是以使將來的中國無線電事業，發生種種的窒碍。我們希望中國的業餘家，也像歐美各國一般能够負起責任，使中國的無線電事業有正當的發展。一九三三年式收音機  黄鑑村　　近數年來因各國廣播無綫電的發達與普及，收音機的構造亦隨之日新月異。昔日最流行的礦石式收音機，不久即爲真空管收音機，「取而代之」。就是到了現在真空管收音機可以説還是方興未艾。　　真空管的發達由二極而三極而四極而五極，以至於最新式管，極改良的能事，每遇新管一出，則收音機的構造也就要更新一次，迄今收音機的構造也不知翻過多少花様了。　　所謂一九三三年式收音機者，也就是因爲最新式管ＵＺ５５號式，ＵＺ５６式，ＵＺ５７號式，ＵＺ５８號式，ＵＺ５９號式等之出現，而産生出來的最新式收音機。這些最新式管在上海雖有出售，但利用這些管子所製成的一九三三年式最新收音機，在上海却還未見有出售之處。兹爲讀者計，特將此種最新式收音機的構造，介紹一種於下：　　如圖所示，以ＵＺ五八號式管爲高周率一級放大，以ＵＺ五六號式管爲回授檢波用，以五極管爲末級低周率放大之用。如是即以能以最經濟的管數而獲得最大的效率。　　最新式管ＵＺ五八號式者就是在二三五號式的可變Ｕ管中再另加一掩蔽栅極（Ｓuppressor　Grid）者，其放大率比較二三五號式管可得三倍以上。　　本收音機的音量調節是用接在五八號式管隂極的變量耗阻器Ｒ２來把隂極的電壓增減的。由這個方法可將聽不出的微音增至最大音量。　　這些五人，五六，等的最新式管的特點就是可以使電源變壓器以及濾波線路簡單化。因爲用在本收音機的三只真空管的燈絲電壓都是二·五伏脱，故電源變壓器的線圈祗用一個就够了，並且屏電壓全部二五○伏脱已足使用，因此可以省略許多的耗阻器。選擇性之研究  李元慶　　最近因爲各處播音臺激增，一般聽衆們，對於收音機的選擇性，都不免發生了問題。譬如説上海罷，現在大小已有四十多家的播音臺，除掉極少數備有多級高週波放大和無極外差式收音機外，都感覺着騷擾的痛苦，和隔絶的困難。本篇所要討論的，便是怎様纔能改進收音機的選擇性。　　誰都知道縮短天線，是可以增加選擇性的。不錯，減短天線，便是減少天綫吸收外來電波的面積。同時天線的本身電阻，也隨之減之。確乎可以增加相當的選擇性。但是收音機收到的播音，在音量方面，便有很大的影響。（尤其是接收外埠的播音）所以縮短天線來增加選擇性，這是得不償失的。　　天線電路中串聯一小量可變儲電器後，能减短短天線的長度，也可增加少許選擇性：又減少初級線圈的圈數，也有相當的功效，不過都不免有上述的缺點。　　利用瀘波器來隔絶不需要的電波、很有顯著明功效，可是使用不得法時，牠的隔絶作用，很是廣闊。譬如七萬五千瓦特的中央廣播臺，（波長四百四十公尺）使用濾波器後，在南京也能隔掉，但是其他四百至五百公尺的播音，也一起給牠隔掉。同時天線電路中串聯線圈與儲電器後，不免略有電阻，旣有電阻，必有相當損失，所以使用濾波器後，接到的播音，在音量方面，比較上總要差些。　　其他普通改進選擇性的方法，還有多種，不過多不免有顧此失彼之憾。　　向來收音機的選擇性和音量，總是立在相反的地位的。選擇性好的音量就小，反之音量大，選擇性也就不好，你想二者兼得，那麽非得在根本上着手不可。　　收音機選擇性的好壞，原因固然很多，但是最重要的一點，牠是和調節級數的多少成平方比的，拿公式來表明，便是：選擇性二調節級數２　　譬如收音機原來祇有一級調節的，現在多加一級，那麽牠的選擇性，比較原來的就要好四倍，再加一級，就要好九倍：：依　類推，便知要想改進收音機的選擇性必須增加調節的級數。　　下面的幾個例子，都是根據了上述的原理而設計改良的。　　以前風行一　的ＲＣＡ十六號機，牠一共有三級高週波放大，照理選擇性第一圖　　應該是很好的，但是牠爲了要避免各種天線長短高低不同的影響，所以牠是採用直接磁感交連式的。（第一級高週波放大並不調節）因此收音機的選擇性和靈敏度，都大爲鋭减。補救的方法，如第一圖，添一級天線調節器，便可增加不少選擇性靈敏度和音量。　　第二圖虚線所示的天線電路，如果第二圖把牠去掉，改換一級調節的天線電路，也可增加不少選擇性和音量。收音機已使用高週波放大，如果選擇性第三圖　　仍舊不能滿意，可添一級前方選擇器，Ｐre,Ｓelector（如第三圖）便可得到美滿的效果。　　再生式收音機使用前方選擇器後，選擇性，靈敏度和音量，都有特殊的增加。第四圖　　不過再生式收音機，因爲本身發生振盪的緣故，極易引起狂呌。構造時Ｌ須繞二十圈，在十圈及十五圈上各接一頭，狂呌時天線改接圈數較多的接頭，便可避免。又Ｌ3繞二圈或三圈。（見第四圖）　　假如附近有强力的播音臺，使用前方選擇第五圖　　器後，依舊餘波未息，那麽可在Ｌ４内添一濾波器，便可完全隔掉。（注意如第五圖。此濾波器與Ｌ４爲不直接交連，且直徑甚小，故對於不同波長之隔絶作用，極爲薄弱）。　　選擇性最好的，當然要推極外差式收音機了，不過牠的構造和原理，都很複雜，這裏因爲篇幅的關係，留待下次再談罷。　　附言　首都自中央廣播台開幕後，因該台電力特大，致當地聽衆，非用無極外差式收音機，極難陳絶。三月前，作者在再生式收音機中加一級前方選擇器後，已不受該台之騷擾。最近在栅路内添一濾波器後，該台之播音，不在諧振點時，已不能收到。（按敝處與該台，空間距離不過三里左右）。同時接收外埠播音，音量則仍見增加也自動音量控制法  明襄　　最近二三年來。無線電學術的進展，日新月異，發明的事物，層出不窮。最有興趣的，莫如採用自動，音量控制法（AutomaticVolumeＣontrol）。收音機遇到强力播音臺的訊號，音量過强時，能自動的減弱，音弱的訊號，亦能自動的增强，控制這音量的機件，就是無線電靈魂的真空管。　　要明瞭自動音量控制法的原理，必先研究普通控制音量的方法。假設所用的真空管是３５或５１號，栅極負電位必需有三伏脱至五十伏脱的變動，方可完成音量控制的作用：如圖ＲＩ是栅位圖一圖二　　電阻器（ＨoasResister）真空管屏流經過這電阻，能有三伏脱的電位降，以供給最小栅極負電位：Ｒ２Ｒ２Ｒ３同是控制音量的機件，前者是一固定電阻，後者是高電阻的變阻器（Ｒheostat），變阻器的活動點Ｃ應接至電壓分位器（ＶoltageＤ）ivider）上負五十伏脱的一端：因Ａ點連通地線，電位是零，所以ＡＣ兩點間電位的差是五十伏脫，經過ＡＣ間的電流，須視ＡＣ間的電阻大小而定，如變阻器的活動點Ｃ移至Ｄ，因ＡＣ間的電阻極大，故流過Ｒ２的電流極微·在電學定律上，已知電流經過一電阻所降落的電壓，與電流成正比，現在Ｒ２經過的電流極微，其電位降亦極小，通常可以忽視之，故此時真空管栅極的負電位最小，僅等於Ｒ２的電位降—三伏脱，此時真空管最靈敏　，訊號的音量最强：再以Ｃ點自Ｄ向Ｂ移動。ＡＣ間的電阻逐漸減少，電流同時增大，Ｒ２的電位亦增，Ｃ點至Ｂ時，ＡＣ間的電阻僅有Ｒ２，所以Ｒ２的電位降就是ＡＣ間的電壓—五十伏脱，栅極負電位在此時最大，等於ＲrＲ２電位降的總數—五十三伏脱，這時訊號的音量最弱，</p>
<p>假設有一電阻，他的大小可以用音量的强弱控制的，音量强時，電阻能自動的減少：音量弱時，能自動增大，以這電阻來代圖一的變阻器Ｒ３，那麽，自動音量控制的目的，不是就達到了嗎　　依照真空管的特性，其屏路電阻，可變動栅電位控制之，所以我們另用一真空管Ｖ２（圖二），以外來訊號之强弱變動此真空管的栅電位，用道真空管的屏路電阻代圖一的變阻器：當外來訊號過强時，控制管的栅電位增高，屏電阻減小，同時經過Ｒ２的電流加大，Ｖr的栅負電位增高，於是訊號的音量能自動的減弱，此與圖一Ｃ點在Ｂ時情形相同：如外來訊號弱時，情形完全相反。　　控制管的栅極負電位，應略低於能使屏電流完全截止爲度：這様：低弱的訊號進來時，控制管可不致有屏流流行，影響到音量的减弱。</p>

<p>各國應用廣播無幾電槪况  仲琴　　無線電在今日，雖只僅月短短的歷史，然而現在地球上差不多没有一處没有新的足跡了。最近幾年，無線電事業更突飛猛進，世界各國，由政府領導民衆　力利用無線電，都有不可思議的成績。故無線電之功用亦因之更爲廣大。　　在無線電發明的初期，唯一的用途是一面廣播音樂節目，一面由商店公司等借作廣告宣傳。後來漸漸改良，始而報告商情，繼而傳佈新聞。用於宣傳事　　播世界。　　無線電之應用於宣傳政策，始於歐洲，各國相率仿效，現在凡要人政客的宣言意見及發表批評談話等，都應用了無線電。最的幾年，更有利用無線電爲外交上的工具的。即如最近日本，常利用許多無線電臺，作種種的反宣傳。希圖淆亂國際視聽。此項應用，簡直　無線電來作爲侵略戰爭上的武器，以代替槍砲了。　　在歐洲有若干的廣播電臺，用於學術上的播送，如在大學校中逢著名的敎授學者授　的時候　　用　　電播音　在美國亦有若干電臺，用以授課及攷講述社會問題普通科學等。這在我國目前則尙未見諸實行。　　歐洲各國的無線電大抵用作演講及交換學問智識之用，在美國則大部份用作娱樂之用，所以在美國的洛衫基紐約等處，有許多歌舞人物竟被稱無線電明星。這種無線電明星，都是在無線電播音時歌唱的人物，這一點却是歐美的不同處。　　法國的無線電臺，有幾處常用以宣傳宗敎，由傳敎師播音，講述信敎的好處，現在美國各地，也有同様的宗敎宣傳。此外用作報告運動的也很多，尤其是美國，有一個無綫電臺專爲運動界而設立，　　美國自從無線電廣播戲院節目以後，戲院中顧客，約少去十分之三，預料戲院中或將停止無線電廣播，以免營業上受到影響，　　無線電用作警務機關捕盜的工具，以法國德國爲嚆矢，現在各國的熱閙城市也已採用。法於警備車之上裝説無線電播音及收音機關，開到各處巡查，如遇盜刦立刻報告警務機關及其他的警備車，共同出發，加以逮捕。</p>
<p>現在美國的許多報館中，訪員與報館間的通信，十九是用無線電收發的，所以現在的美新聞界消息十分迅速，然而有一種弊端，就是電浪可以被人假借，或者洩漏。所以美國的報館中用的無線電是多用暗號的。　　這種種都是近來無線電應用的大槪情形，現在短波無線電已日就發達，預料必有許多新的應用方法發明，這里從略。無極外差式淺釋  襄　　現在流行的收音機，線路大槪可分爲二種；一，調整高週率法（Ｔ·Ｒ·Ｆ），二、無極外差法（Ｓuper　Ｈeterodyne）：無極外差法係阿姆斯脱郎在歐戰時所發明，起初僅是試騐室的工作，公開給商用，還不過五年的歷史，其基本原理，即爲利用中間週率放大，故需二次檢波：其優點最著者，如選擇性之特佳等，現市上五管以上的收音機，鮮有不採用這種線路的，　　這種種收音機各部的排列，如下圖，現在略述各部的作用：　　外來的音號經高週率放大級放大後，輸入第一檢波級的栅路：設其週率是一○○○基羅週，而本身振盪級産生的振盪週率，設爲一一七五基羅週，亦藉交連作用輸入至第檢波級的栅路：這時候第一檢波級的輸入線路裏，有兩種不同週率的音號相混合，結果則産生一第三種週率，這週率一定恰等於前二種之差數，即一七五奉羅週，就是所謂的中間週率：若中間週率放大級調整至與此週率相諧振時，那麽這音號强度，必大爲放大：但是這中間週率的音號，我們人類的聽覺，還小能感受，所以必須經過第二次檢波，（檢波的作用，與尋常檢波法同）然後再輸入成音週率放大級，以求更大的音量，　　中間週率不限定是一七五基羅週，祇要在中間週率範甲内的均可，大約自一○基羅週至二○○基羅週，　　市上收音機，高週率放大級，本身振盪級及第一檢波級之調整電容器，都連在一根軸上，使産生之中間週率適和其中間週率放大級諧振，所以調整時，祗須轉動一扭，便可得到清晰響亮的音樂了，各種真空管之接綫圖  徐秉鉢　　現在新出各種真空管，如四極，五極强力輸出管，以及最近之無絲極真空管，花様煩多，初學者往往無從下手，少一不慎，即有將真空管化爲廢物之虞·爰擬一圖以備參考。第一圖所示者均爲四只脚，二粗二細，粗者俱通絲極，而細者各有不同，如甲圖係示三極真空管之接法，二細脚，一通栅極（Ｇrid）一連屏極（Ｐlate），下列諸管屬之。乙圖示真流電幛隔極。（Ｓcreen　Ｇridlube）管如ＵＸ２２２，２３４一類之管，管上有一銅帽，通平常栅極，二細脚一通屏極，一連幛隔極丙圖示雙屏極整流管（Ｆull　ＷaveＲectifierＴube）如ＵＸ２８０一類管子之接法，故二細脚俱通屏極　　丁圖示單屏極整流管（ＨaltＷaveRectifierTube如ＵＸ２８１管之接法，細脚雖有二只，實際祇用一只以通屏極，真他一脚用以變飾而已。　　因爲用電池之三極真空管，使用</p>
<p>煩。又不經濟，激有種交流真空管的　發明，種用交流電以燈　　蓋平常三極管　　　，若通以交流電，則所收之音，僅爲噏之交流聲，爲消除此聲，乃在管内另加一極，藉幅射之力，間接以熱隂極，（絲極）熱之。故名之爲傍熱式（Ｈeater　Type）。但交流真空管亦有不用傍熱式者，則絲極間恒接有中分電阻，此類管子常用作高低週率之放大，傍熱式中普通用者，爲ＵＹ２２７燈絲電壓爲二半弗打，電流一，七五安培，可作檢波及高低週率放大之用，新式者有５７號真空管，管身略小，而燈絲電流僅需一安培，故電流消耗亦較省也。效力稍較前式爲佳，燈脚有五，不分組細，接法可參閲（Ａ）圖　　在原有屏栅極之外，再加一幛隔極（Ｓcreen　Ｇrid），在高週率放大中，頗顯效力，如用之得法，則效力較普通之三極管，大可四五倍，此類之真空管略舉如下：２２４２３５２３６２３９５５１ＹＵ燈脚亦祗有五只，管上有帽通栅極，接法如（Ｂ）圖第二圖　　幛隔真空管發明之後，有一種五極强力管（Ｐentode）其絲極屏極及栅極之構造，與三極彷彿，但有二幛隔極。一圍屏極，即第五極名接地極接連隂極而置於屏極與幛隔極間此第二幛隔極用以　少由陽極（屏極）听發射之　電子，如此可增加放大之效率，故現在新式家用收竟様，祇　一級低週率之放也，現最普通所用低週率放大用之五極强力輪出管　有２４７，及新式用電池二弗之２？？，接法如圖（Ｃ）　　（Ｄ）圖係示最新六極真空管之接法，有５７號真空管適用於檢波及放大之用，５８適用於高週率及中波放大或外差式線路中（Ｓuper　Ｈeterodyne）第一檢波管之用，效力極佳，燈脚有六，管上亦有銅帽，通平常之栅極，接線方式可參閲（Ｄ）圖，　　尙有其他如一管兩用之真空管雙攣管，Ｔriple　Ｔwin以及行將問世之無絲極眞空管其構造及接線方式。俟他日有機會再談。歐洲無綫電界關於波長的分配  仲琴　　前在比利時布魯塞爾舉行的萬國聯合無線電學會，曾議决於本年六月在瑞士琉森（Ｌucerne）召集次届萬國聯合無綫電學會時，將成立一個琉森國際無線電總會。並有一個關於波長分配的方案，亦將在次届集會時討論通過，交由琉森國際無線電總會管理，現在這個關於波長分配的方案已由無線電界擬定公佈了。　　所謂波長分配的方案，在歐洲無線電界中已醖釀了許久，當一九二九年時，萬國聯合無綫電學會在捷克斯拉夫的布拉格（Ｐraga）舉行，那時已有波長分配問題的討論。但是有許多的無線電學者尙認爲時機未熟，没有討論的必要，於是這個問題無形之中暫時擱置起來，當拉格集會舉行之時，歐洲共有無線電播音電臺二百所，總計發電力爲四百二二的基羅瓦特（Ｈilowatt）平均每個播音電臺有二·一的基羅瓦特，殆至今年一月的統計，歐洲的無線電播音電臺增至二百五十四所，而總共的電力爲四萬六千基羅瓦特，平均每一所電臺的電力爲十八基羅瓦特，依照這様的計算，播音電臺之增加數量爲百分之二十五，而播音電臺之電力則驟然增加至十倍，因此波長數相近似之播音電臺間，每每發生紛擾，收音之時，調節頗感困難，所以到現在許多無線電專家認爲討論波長的分配的時機已熟，經過了數度研究，提出幾項條欵，一經六月中琉森集合無線電學會時通過，即可實行，其條欵包括五類，兹一一分述於後：　　（一）波長數相差不遠，差數在九至十一基羅週率以内的兩電臺，若雙方又同爲强電力時，應當增加彼此二電臺之時間的間隙，不能够在同時播音，以免紛擾電浪，　　（二）播音電臺應受地位上的指派，凡兩播音電臺之波長數相差不遠者，其地位應行遠離，其距離若干應由琉森國際無線電總會指定　　（三）凡播音電臺的播音電力，應由琉森國際無綫電總會按照情形指定一適合之最大電力數量，而加以限止。播音電臺不得私自增加電力，超過無線電總會所設定之數目　　（四）凡小電臺之與其他電臺同時播音以實騐　練習者，其波長數應由琉森國際無線電總會規定，以免於播音之時妨礙别電臺播音之電浪　　（二）凡波長數相等之電臺，其設立應加以限止，其爲地方上之小電臺時，則應規定其距離，不能相離過近，且須規定其距離，並偵得波此二電臺播音時絶不紛擾時，方可允許其播音　　這幾條辦法雖然是很費事的，然而在無綫電界之中，最好有再嚴密些的管理，琉森無錢電國際總會成立之後，説</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>不定更有嚴密的條件訂立，這様一來設立一個播音電臺雖比較不自由些，然而爲避免各種不良現象的發生，這種管理方法是極適當的。如何管理無綫電波  曹東昇　　近年來上海無線電臺相繼設立，多如雨後春筍。因之各電臺間，不免互相干擾，而引起聽衆的不快。他們無意的或有意的形成了無線電波的戰爭。還有幾處，因了調幅（Ｍadulato）電力的過强，以致波幅太闊，收音機的刻度盤上竟有被佔至十度二十度的。現在交通部雖已有取締規定，但所給予電臺的波長，大都在較短的地方，範圍又狹而各電臺能有準確的波長的又少，所以干擾仍不能免。據我個人的見解，以爲週率相差，至少要在二五ＫＣ以上，而分配波長，須視電臺電力的大小。例如二百公尺至三百五十公尺之間，可由五十瓦特以上之各電臺使用，而三百五十至五百公尺，則給予五十瓦特以下之電臺。　　還有一層須要特别注意的，就是現在各電臺，尤其是五十華脱以上之大電臺，都擠在上海最熱閙的一塊地方。這是很不適宜的。應該也照電力的大小，來分配他們的他位。譬如一百瓦特的應該離城市五里，五百瓦特至一千瓦特的，應該離城市十里，一千瓦特以上，則須離城市二十里以上。至於五十瓦特以下之電臺，可任其在城市中播送。這様分配，可以帮助聽衆不少。　　照上述所説方法辦理起來，時間上的分配已不成問題。如果要進一步避免萬一的衝突，那末再把播送　間就各電臺互相商酌，或由當局加以規定，凡波長較近的二電臺若有一臺播音，他臺即行停止，自不會再有干擾的情形了。　　以上幾點只是我個人的意見，希望政府加以注意，希望各電臺予以考慮。播音界的「播音用語」問題  AA　　—國語與世界語—　　申報爲提倡無線電事業起見，特邀請上海各大無線電商家，舉行無線電展覽會。我們歡喜研究無線電朋友，聽了這個消息，一定非常高興，大家擁到會場上去參觀一下，外埠的許多朋友，雖然没有機會親臨觀覽，也一定讚頌這種盛舉。但是諸君在參觀在讚頌的時候，</p>
<p>曾不曾注意到想會到播音界一個重要的問題？是什麽問題呢？就是關於「播音用語」的問題。　　這誠然是一個重大的問題，我們在收聽任何節目的時候，一定是時常感到的播音不比對面談話，這種困難，播音界也是時常感到的。</p>
<p>播音的目的，要普遍地傳到全國，全世界，使全國全世界聽到的人都能懂得，尤其是關於新聞，演講以及宣傳等等材料。現在我們的播音界的用語本偏於局限性了，大家都用了自已本鄉的用語，上海話，寗波話，無錫話，常州話，廣東話：：亂七八糟，不管人家聽得懺聽不同，這在播音的效用上，能够説得上幾或效果嗎？對於中國，這還是不難解决的問題，因爲只要用國語來播音就能够解决了。國語在現在，雖然也不是人人能够聽得懂的語言，但國語是一國的標準語，應該推行全國，而且人人廳該　得牠，這様，只要一國的人民大家起來破費一點工夫，從事學習，不上幾個月工夫，便人人能够聽懂，對國内的播音便毫無問題了。這一點，現在的播音界也已經注意到，而且有好幾個電台也已經漸漸地見諸實行了。但是對於全世界的播音用語，依然還是一個重大的問題。　　一則新聞要使全世界的人都能够聽懂，現在還是屬於不可能，任憑你用英語，用法語，用德語，用日語，用俄語去播音，也依然祇是英法德日俄以及懂得英法德日任文的人聽得懂，那些人用全世界的比例來計算，真是極少的少數，而且就是這様也已經費去五倍的時間去做這工作了。費了那様多的時間而僅僅傳播給全世界中的少數人知道，想起來真太不合算—那末，要怎様才能够以極經濟的方法而使全世界的人都能够聽懂呢？那非用一種全世界的人都能够聽懂的　用語不可。　　自然，現在，没有全世界人聽得懂的公用語。但却已經有一種爲全世界所公認的國際公用語Ｅsperanto（世界語）我們如果採用Ｅsperanto來做「播音用語」，那末對國際的宣傳工作，一定能够事半功倍，因爲對於世界到處都已有傳習世界語的機關了。　　上海，在一九零八年，就開始有傳習世界語的機關，卽上海世界語學會，中國的世界語運動，完全策源於該學會。該學會的郵址是「上海郵箱一三三二」。代乙電部份的保險裝置  潘仁榮　　保險裝置，在無線電上似乎是一件很重要的事情。避當的保險裝置，祇須在天地線未入收音機之前裝一個電燈開關就行，其重要是誰都知道的。至於代乙電部份的保險裝置，也回様的重要。如果在乙電流的輸出發生　礙時則因乙電路負荷過大的結果，低週扼制圈，濾波電容器及其收音機的屏路各部很有連鎖燒壞的可能。今如在圖甲乙的Ｘ處串連一個電筒中用的小電珠，則負荷大時先把電珠燒去，别部可不致靡爛，而且欲求乙電流的數值，也可用千分安培表在這裏量得。圖甲係全波整流圖乙係半波的小型代乙電（其製法請參閲第六期本刋拙稿）如在電源變壓器的輸入串聯一保險絲，（圖Ｒ處）則整個電源部份也可賴以安全。再如在整流燈絲線路中裝一絲極電阻，使用時將電阻徐徐開足，在真空管壽命方面也有很多的帮助，上述三者，都是輕而易舉，值得一試。讀者研究一隻一燈機的成就  朱紫源　　在松江要用礦石機收聽上海的播音，是比較困難的事，就是天地線設計得好，也祇能在人靜深夜時。如在日間，或比較熱閙些地方，那可直似蚊子呌，所以我從上海一搬到松江來，便决計放棄礦石機，努力來自製一隻直流單管機，除了聽筒天地線舊有以外，我又買了下面幾様另件：　　（一）蛛網式三回路線圈架，（二）二十四號漆包線約四十碼，（三）○○○三五可變電容器一隻，（四）○○○二五固定電容器一隻，（五）二ＭＥＧ　漏一隻，（六）三十歐姆可變電阻一隻，（七）ＵＳ式燈臺一隻，（八）一○九飛利浦真空管一隻。　　其他還買了些接線柱，挿子，甲乙電等，第一步我是繞線圈，初級圈繞了六圈，次級和再生圈，當初都没有數，但整個的蛛網板，都被我繞滿了。繞畢後便裝置各另件於膠板及底板上，膠板是用舊留聲唱片代的，用鑽子燒紅了鑽洞非常便利，效果和膠板没有分别，金錢方面却節省了不少，外觀也和膠板無甚分别，祇是没有光澤罷了。裝好後，便照Ａ圖接線。排列位置見Ｂ國，一切都裝置妥當了，便接上電池，甲電用圓乾電一筒，乙電用小扁電八個串接，套上聽筒，開了電阻，用手觸Ｃ定片，却没有卜卜聲音，這顯然真空管没有動作，手觸座子上Ｇ字，卜卜很響，電阻關小，聲音也隨之而低，這又明明告訴我燈炮没有壞。而且燈脚和燈座的接觸也没有問題，再查各處接頭，没有鬆脱，整整弄了半天，方想出也許是線圈接反了，便把次級圈接在Ｃ的動片和定片的兩端，調一個頭，原來接定片的，現在接動片，原來接動片的，現在接定片，這様一來，固然起振動了，接上天地線，果然，有嘘嘘呌聲，旋退再生圈，聲音便清楚了那時我何等快活呵！　　聽了幾天，才發現我的收音機還有大錯誤咧，原來那時，國華在四十度，華東在三十度左右，二十度以下完全没有電臺，最長電臺，祇能收得三瑞堂，這不是次級圈繞得過多了嗎？於是重行卸下，拆去十幾圈，中央才在七十度出現，而華東也同時退到十五度，這機的波長範圍才算合了。　　人體影響（Ｂodyoffct）是最討厭的，不料我的機也犯上了這個毛病，紙要手一放，聲音就會變呌，或减輕，真是痛苦極了，後來在Ａ十Ｂ十和地線間，接一根線，（Ａ圖中虚線）這毛病就好了，　　有一次，因爲電將要用完的緣故，電阻幾乎開完，再生圈也幾乎和次級圈接觸了，偶然把在手邊的一隻○○二　法拉特的固定電容器跨接在聽筒脚上，再生力立刻增加了不少，聲音也增了許多，再生圈也退也了一吋多，於是我便把這隻電容器固裝在機上了，（Ａ圖中Ｃ２）因此知道旁路電容器實在很重要咧。以後聲音要比未裝前響得多，未裝的同志，不妨裝上試試—　　機裝了二個月，成績總算不錯，在三百公尺以下的電台，真是非常的響亮，每到晚間離耳二呎，言語還歷歷可辨，一次，很靜的半夜，收到上海大中華五百瓦特的播音，正在試騐與人家通話，將聽筒放在室中桌上，全室都能聽得輕而清的唱片，然而在收三百公尺以上，真空管總是不容易生振動，必須要將電阻開多，或將再生圈靠近次級圈，音量也没有三百公尺以下的電台那様響。我想：也許是天線太短了，或是初級圈太少了，或再生力不够。但因地位限就，和鄰居阻撓，改裝天線是不可能的，那末祗有加多初級圈，由六圈加至十二圈，而十五圈，弊病没有改得好，却把還擇性弄糟了，簡直是擾得不能收聽。後來重繞再生圈，細細調節乙電，都不得相當效果，三百公尺以上，依舊那麽輕。不知怎様，却忽然想起在天線回路裏加裝一個線圈不是一様嗎？可調節的不是比固定的更好嗎？因此立刻在舊有礦石機上折下一個線圈，接在天線回路裏，而用滑鍵調節如Ｃ圖。好了，在收聽三百公尺以上的電台時，可將滑鍵向Ｘ點以增線圈長度，如在收三百公尺以下的，則將滑鍵撥向Ｙ點，以减少線圈長度，而對於選擇性却無所損，三百公尺以上的電台如三端堂，新新，和國華永生等同様響亮，收聽中央時，更是大響而特響，其他試騐小電台和日本電台也多收了不少，而最使我驚喜的。就是ＫＺＲＭ竟和松江收杭州一様響，這不是有趣的一會事嗎？所用線圈係二十四號漆包線在三吋徑筒上，約繞六七十轉，另用滑鍵調節。　　現在成功的如此，成績確實不差：然而最近感到麻煩的，就是須常換甲乙電，所以我想改用交流供給，一俟試騐有效，當再續爲貢獻。</p>

<p>春秋天開裸運  瞻廬　　天開文運是昔日科舉時代的一種標語，每逢考試，總有這麽四個字點綴在扁額上面。現在呢，舊式的文運告終，新式的裸運開始：自從去年香港的裸體運動轟傳一時，居然無獨有偶，本月二十日路透電，哈爾濱也有同様的裸體運動：而且，命名爲「亞當與夏娃」。我嫌美中不足，裸運塲中没有一個堂皇冠冕的扁額，大書特書道：「天開裸運。」　　裸運信徒所傳播的裸體真經，無非説：「如是我聞，以無關無絆之身，」舞蹈沐浴於大自然日光之下，可以增進健康，愉快精神，暴露肌肉的美，表示聖潔的心。」而且，命名亞當與夏娃，益發見得裸運的光明與正大：當那亞當夏娃同在天國的時候，無需衣服，赤條條來去無牽掛：這一輩裸運信徒，居然取法亞當夏娃，可見他們的抱負非凡。楞嚴經所載佛對阿難説：「一切皆空，故大空無我，無所可蔽，衣服遂無所可用。」裸運信徒的不掛一絲，非但，學着天國樂園中亞當夏娃：而且又有「大空無我」的佛敎精神。誰説今世界是淫亂世界？誰説莽乾坤是穢惡乾坤？有了這一輩裸運信徒，男也裸，女也裸，男無所見，女無所覩，南無亞當夏娃菩薩，南無阿羅菩薩。　　設或，不然。男也裸，女也裸，男有所見，女有所覩，本是裸體運塲，化作肉感交易所！佛云：「不可説，不可説。」子曰：「如之何？如之何？」做人難在一張嘴  怡怡館主　　提起「做人難」我想凡是人，都有這個感想吧？本來一個人，在娘肚裏鑽出來的時候，所以不先嘻嘻而笑，却先呱呱而啼，據説爲的就是表示「做人難」　　雖然，「做人難」，説穿了，其實别的都不難。所難的，不過在一張嘴。我們知道，一個人的嘴，除了必須説話以外，還必須吃飯。做人的難處，就在這説話與吃飯的一進一出之間。　　因爲，一個人説話謙遜了，就是拍馬屁。説話剛直了，就要得罪人。説話軟了，就是没用的傢伙。説話硬了，就要給人怨恨。説話誠實，受人欺。説話虚僞，失信用。應該説的話而不説，是不會説話。不可説的話而瞎説，難免遭横禍。這也不對，那又不是。於此可見做人説話之難，要説也説不盡許多！　　至於吃飯，也是難。並不是現成的米，有人種出來，只要具有二張嘴，便可亨受得到的，是要有吃飯的本領纔行。否則，人家煑好了香噴噴的白米飯，不該你吃的，那你只好望着瞧，把口沬向着肚裏嚥。何况朱業的人，一天多一天，尋飯吃，格外難。就是你幸運，給你找到了職業。他媽的，不供膳。那麽，吃飯依然在你自已去想法。唉！總而言之，「天下無如吃飯難！」　　這般看來，説話與吃飯，都是做人不能免的。而且，都是用嘴的，却都有如此難。所以，我要説：「做人難在一張嘴！」這話似乎不撒半句謊吧？厠所裏的壁畫  阿絜　　肉香的春風，令我分外想着女人了！</p>
<p>她的温柔，和麻醉的ＸＸ部分：她令我回復了已逝的青春！這是ＸＸ交易所，厠所壁上題畫詩的一首，因爲有王次回疑雨集一般的香艷温馨：所以在下恭而敬之的抄了下來。有人讀了這首香奩詩後，問我那幅「壁畫」怎様。在下合十答道：當然是我佛無遮大會的寫真，工細絶倫，的是名畫師的作品。雖然仇十洲見了，也要自嘆勿如：吳道子見了，也必拜倒下風。甚麽用直ＸＸ寺楊惠之塑的佛像，山西大同的唐代壁畫，委實是同様的珍貴！况且，又有新詩人題上了一首新詩，益發聲價百倍，足稱無價之寳，希世奇珍！惜乎，欣賞的，只有出恭的滿座高朋，少來位書畫骨董大家，只落得躱在厠所，抱璞不遇，難逢却已，也算是不幸的了。　　這是第一號厠所裏的壁畫：第二號厠所的壁畫，却有些「道心」了。畫的是一位花朶兒美人，有幾只狗，　涎欲滴，堅跟在那美人身旁。又來一首題詞道：　美人啊！你外觀多麽美麗，内容却不堪設想！狗啊！狗啊！你快不要瘋狂！　　第三號厠的的壁畫，尤爲佳妙。一個美麗的女人，手裏拿了一塊肉，作賜給狗吃的様兒：身旁蹲着一只摇尾的哈吧狗，狗尾後注了三字道：「肉香啊」！最可惜的，是第四號厠所的壁畫，因爲不曉得那一個惡作劇，把好好一幅壁畫，抹上了許多鉛痕，只賸了兩雙「肉腿」，漶漫了别的部分，令人起廬山五老之感。旁邊還注四字道：「人格何在一！大槪出於道學先生的手筆吧。　　本來，我國人富於藝術思想，多名畫大家，弄堂裏撒尿的地方，垃圾桶墻上，往往可以找到許多壁畫，像小烏龜之類。那交易所的厠所，砌磁爲磚，十分富麗：當然，上厠的仁兄，逸興遄飛，輕揮妙腕，題詩作畫起來，淋漓盡致，滿壁琳瑯，去供獻出恭朋友的欣賞。長篇小說東北四連長  張恨水第七回　數語絶恩情閉門痛哭一扄擔道義酌酒商談田青笑道：當着老太爺在這裏，這話可得分個明白。你説不能照着我的路數，我有什麽壞路數不成？殷得仁夾了雞骨頭在口裏咀嚼着，只管向田青微笑。田青更急了，笑道：你這話得説明，我究竟是什麽路數。殷得仁喝了一口酒，將胸脯挺起來，向了田青望着道：我老大哥，就直言無隠了。就是照着愛情説話，彼此相愛，誰也不能光享權利，誰也不能光盡義務。可是我只看到你請黄女士吃館子瞧電影，可没有瞧見黄女士請過你。只看過你送黄女士的東西，没瞧見黄女士送你的東西。只瞧見你給黄女士提大衣，扶手膀子，没瞧見黄女士：：趙自强又着手攔住來道：你這話又是外行話了。你以上所説的，那都是戀愛原則上規定了的。殷得仁道：那末，男女戀愛未免太不平等了。趙翁哈哈笑道：我來説一句實話罷。現在許多女學生，没有嫁丈夫以前，都説守獨身主義，可是有入來作媒，他就不守獨身主義了。男人的意思，又何嘗不是這様，找不到女人的時候，就守獨身主義，找得到女人的時候，就要組織家庭了。這一説，大家便哈哈大笑起來。殷得仁一拍巴掌道：我敢起誓，我决計不娶親。到了老來，我還有姪子家裏可去，我就在姪子家裏養老得了。關耀武笑道：我那些兒子，總也算是你的姪子，你打算靠他們養老去嗎？連我自已還不知道靠誰養老呢，你倒是願靠他們養老嗎？這句話，自然問得殷得仁很窘。（八二）凉亭  鵬　　在浙江省錢塘江下流富桐縣屬的一帶山鄉裏，幾年前我曾經有過一個長期的旅行，那裏的人民大都業農，兼以做紙，牧畜等副業：民氣儉樸，仁厚，絶不似一般都會市民的奢侈傲慢，那裏的風景，長年如畫，循着季節的不同，山水，樹木，變換着各様的顏色，交織成一幅幅艷美，濃绿，凄清，素樸的圖畫，如果　在這一帶長途旋行，一方面鑒賞這沿途的景色，固然會使心懷開暢，永不厭倦：即使你感到走得疲乏了，你也隨時可以找到休息的地方，那就是幾乎每隔上幾里必設有一所的「凉亭」。　　這種「凉亭」大槪都是長方形，跨立在路的中間，有的造得很考究，一様的也是白粉的牆，黑的瓦：裏面安放着兩排石凳，亭角裏還設有一座竃，一個鍋子，那是一些慈善者出錢雇人燒了茶，施給行人喝的，如果再在前後門安上兩扇門，那幾乎和普通民房一般，有的却很簡陋，只是在四根或六根柱子上架上個亭頂，再在柱腰裏横釘了兩長條木板作坐凳就算了，後者因爲四面通風很適宜於夏天，創者却比較的適宜於冬天。　當你一個人長途的跋涉在那深山峻嶺之間，尤其是在夏天，正流着汗，喘着氣的當兒，一旦踏進了這休息的處所（凉亭）定會使你感到一種沁心的爽適—如果這亭子裏正靜寂得只有你一個人的話，那你可以聽到那亭的四週的每一片樹棄，每一股溪流，都在對你細語喁喁，或是你從那亭壁上，亭柱上，去拜讀許多用着歪斜的筆跡題着的有趣的壁詩！但大多的時候你總可以遇到已有三三兩兩同路的鄉人，籮籮擔擔的休息在那裏，他們邊擱起了一條腿用毛竹管杓鍋裏的凉茶喝，邊却東山西水的雜談着，在這裏，真是永遠不會使你感到一點寂寞的！　　不過，「凉亭雖好，終非久留之地」！到後你總得這麽的嘆息着離開了那裏，旅客之不能久戀凉亭，正如人生之不能久戀青青！時間的鞭子驅撻着你，你將永遠低着頭向那長途的旅程奔去！短篇小說寒山和尙（下）  火雪明　　風雨裏，被淋胖的拾得，這回又站住了腿轉過身來，舉起細小的眼，冷覻寒山。一面答：　一哦！是因緣」。一面回頭過去趕他伯路。這幾乎是一個冷靜得全没有血肉的人，對一切都淡漠，輕視，没有同情，没有依戀，像是被封鎖在黑井裏從來不見太陽光的先知那様的冷酷。　　寒山寺已站在眼前了。　　「拾得大師，是山門了。請！」肥胖的鵝，重復蠢笨地旋轉他頸項來，臉上帶了隂暗的微笑，從鼻孔裏噴出一聲「哦」！算是回答。　　終於走進了殿堂，空氣隂沉而又嚴肅，這回，寒山的輕躁氣，被一種看不見的感化，已全消滅了。而且怕拾得着了凍雨，又跋踄着滑澾的泥路，會感到身體不適。馬上邀他進僧房去了。　　寒山拿出新的袈裟來，給拾得説：「請換去濕的吧」！</p>
<p>「不。」短截的齒音，仍舊跌坐在蒲團上。不消説，寒山預備把山鞋，布襪給他換的，現在是不用開口了。然而終想不到這様一匹鵝，待人會那様不近人情。這簡直比打或駡的誣辱更刻毒。　　沉默了一回。紅臘燭的光摇曳着，應該晚飯的時候了。寒山的腦裏，滿藏着不快，苦悶，孤獨，而實際，的確恨着拾得，無論如何總不明白他爲什麽要如此冷酷。於是，想了好久的問題，再不能忍耐，再不能靜默，便輕聲地問了：　「請大師解釋：如果有人打我駡我，欺我辱」我，用極不堪的態度對待我：我應該怎様呢？」　看得出浮映於紫紅光暈裏的拾得底面孔，圓如皮球，眼光下垂，似乎謙遜得不敢昻起頭來平視的様子。暫時没有回答。半响才慢慢地，一字一字地説：「我以爲，應該敬他，畏他，避他，耐他，一味聽他，不必理他，——以後，你且看他。……」説後微微地扯了一下身子，是得意的表示吧。　這過分使寒山驚奇了。你對我的態度，還不是侮辱？然而，準這様講，難道自已一手募建的寺，被破落户搗壞時，不抵抗嗎？假如説是慈悲，嚇！不殺業障，不除攙搶，怎得超度衆生？假如説和尙的本分單在修一已的善行，這只是自私自利的動物，值得給善男信女的供養嗎？不澈底的慈悲，可以養成海一様的罪惡！爲什麽不早用早斷的手段剷除了罪惡的根苗，而結果現實真正普遍的慈悲呢！同様，不以正義與仇敵肉搏，或者不與消滅自已的惡魔奮鬭，不但這黑勢力會吞滅了自已，而且放黑勢力逐漸擴展，又將弄成了怎様的一個世界。　　一切的懷疑，膠住了寒山腦神經，現在是湧起了反叛的情緒。他敵對他看着鵝一様討厭的拾得，怎麽也不會理解「委曲求全」的高僧的哲學。　　「嘿！是兩個世界裏的人，各走各的路吧！」最後，寒山堅决地對自已説。便立起來，離開了禪房，連對拾得一句話都没有，逕向山門外跑。寒山寺的燈火，正照着上獅子山去的巉道。夜雨和楓葉飛遍楓僑的秋宵，寒山一個人在黑暗裏踏上雲遊的征途，去找他的知音去了。</p>

<p>自由談再談秀才的厄運  大聖　　幾天來，許多摇筆桿子的朋友，都在訴説文人的悲苦，尤其是蘧廬主人歷數自南宋以至明清文人的遭遇，題爲「秀才的厄運」，而以一聲「嗚呼」結之，更令人嗚呼不盡。　　其實，秀才厄運，無殊中外，千古同慨。邇日讀鮑克洛夫斯基所著俄羅斯史，中述尼古拉斯第一時代，對於學者們的講演和著述，都監視得極爲嚴厲，每一次講演，必得「官許」，否則認爲「革命」：至於發刋稿件，尤非受極嚴厲的檢查不可。由於這様嚴厲的壓迫，著作家就只能用寓言的方式發表意見，使人從字裏行間穩約地看出所指的是什麽。譬如有人要指摘當時俄國的財政部長白洛克Ｂruck，便只能以奥國的財政部長白羅克Ｂruck爲喻。又如主張解放農奴的文章，也無人敢寫，連「農奴制」這一名詞，也只能稱爲「義務的税」甚至「自然力，與「進步」等字様，都不准提及，因爲那些字様都象徴着革命之故。小説家陀斯妥也夫斯基被流放到西伯利亞，詩人雪甫欽哥被放逐到邊疆、並禁止使用筆墨文具。這是俄國尼古拉斯第一時代文人的遭遇。　　當然，這只是隨手拾來的一個例，某他比尼古拉斯第一時代更爲慘毒的，更是紀不勝紀。　不過，假如文人願意做應制詩或譜清平樂，或如叔孫通一様願爲漢高皇帝定朝儀，則滿朝諸子貴，盡是讀書人，」「萬般皆下品，惟有讀當高，」富貴功名，俯拾即是，文人也便不是生來應遭厄運的了。所以「厄運」與「亨運」，都在文人自擇，所謂「禍福無門，惟人自召。」　然而話説回頭，假如文人而真的便絶口不談「自然力」與「進化」，則俄國到現在也許還停滯在尼古拉斯第一時代：又假如焚書坑儒真的能禁錮人民的思想意志，則現在的中國也許還是秦始皇帝嫡傳子孫的天下。——俄國终於「進化」了，秦始皇的天下也終於只傳了二世而亡。所以一部分的文人也就甘於遭受厄運，甘於遭受慘毒。　　自已也是一個只能摇筆桿的人，撫今追音，再想到自已的前途，我只能發出一聲苦笑。明天  彭家煌　　傍晚，我手裏挾着本書，口袋裏藏着兩毛錢的財産，猶豫的在辣斐德路走。一個嚴重的問題，簡直比「國難」還嚴重，和戰解决不下“「忘了這回事吧，不能。孤注一擲吧，明天呢？：：：」　　鬼使神推似的終究走進餃子店：爲着明天，原打定主意採用「祇來五個」的政策，誰料一開口就呌出「十個」。祇好自認晦氣，决計吃完了走就是。　　媽的，十個餃子解决了七成，又轉歪念頭了：　　「還有别的嗎？」　　「有，牛肉麫二百四。」　　「給來一碗。」門前來了一個外國人，呢帽，黄衣黑褲，破靴，套圓的紅臉上滲着汁，不用猜，白俄，一進門就脱帽，微笑，鞠躬致敬：　　「哈羅，老間，—好？」　　「吃什麽？」　　「餃子。」　　「十個？」　　「十個。」　　五個一道，分兩排擠在小碟裏，皎子是顯得微乎其微，不成様子。他倒了醋，一口一個，一連兩個進了口，生怕浪費了似的，忽又停下了，慢慢的掏出一疊銅板來，一個一個排在桌上，數了兩遍，抬頭苦笑着説：　　「對不起，少一個，明天，明天：」　　「不要緊的。」　　「對不起，明天，：明天馬司克，啊？」　　他安心的倒了三回醋，末後連醋也喝光，文雅的搓着手，看着桌子：抹了嘴，眼睛向周圍逡巡了一回，又看着桌子，不知嘰咕着什麽，又擅自拿着飯碗在櫃台上倒了茶，走回原位慢慢的喝，捱了半個鐘頭。　　雖然没有誰催他，末後倒底走了。但是聽見有人嚷着「ＸＸ去打子斤醋來的肚子反更飢餓，農要　望的「好收成」已經解决不了自身的窮困，而幻想的農産品價格高漲却連　在整個的社會經濟組織上，除了資本主義完全崩潰了之外别無他法。　　有人以爲在資本主義的現狀下，「夢年」總比「歉年」對農民有利一些，而事實却適得其反，這情形一定還要繼續下去。其間的理論非常複雜，不是這短文裏所能説得明白的。蘧廬絮語  子展　　三十四）「談風月」辨　　「多談風月，少發牢騷！」　　風月雅事，亦未易談也。頻頻談之，轉覺不雅，於是乃有詩人禁談風月之故事衆。六一詩話，—宋初有進士—洞省，善爲詞章。嘗會舊詩僧分題，出一紙約曰，不得犯—一字。其字乃山水風雲竹石花草雪霜星月禽鳥之類。緒僧爲之閣律。　清以來，論文者每詆宋詩好發議論。殆未知風月之談，六朝唐人已盡其妙。宋人不甘蹈恒蹊，别開詩境，於是　謂涉理路，落言筌之詩，成爲一代風氣矣。此今之詩人不可不知也。梁書徐勉得，載勉爲吏部尙書，常與門人夜集，客有虞　求詹事五官。勉正色答云：「今夕止可談風月，不宜及公事。」時人咸服其無私。止談風月之典，蓋出於此。今吾人借用之，而曰「今日止可談風月，不宜及國事。「但恐當此高唱」「共赴國難」之秋，所謂革命同志民族英雄見之，或指爲個人主義，而詆其但知有私人，不知有國也。嗚呼，時至今日，談風月亦不易矣，是誡文人之一厄也—紅蘿蔔鬚  ＪＵＬＥＳＫＥＮＡＲＯ林取譯　　紅頰四（總）　　威奥龍的解職使得這班小孩子非常難過。　　他們商量好祗要機會一到便該使得院長先生難堪，這卽是説大家鼓起兩頰，把嘴唇，着一羣土蜂飛起的嗡嗡之聲，表示他們的不滿。這機會不久就會給他們抓着的。　在這機會還没有到來之前，他們祇好相顧黯然。覺得學生對於自已有所留戀的威奥龍，特意趁着學生下了課在休息的時候離去書院。當他領着一個茶房掯着他的箱子出現在操塲的時候，所有的孩子都向他身邊奔去。他和他們握握手，摸摸他們的臉，努力把他身上穿着的那件禮服的後幅從他們的手裏鄭重地抽出。他被他們緊緊的圍住，微笑着，顯出感動的様子。一部分學生正掛在木桿上翻觔斗，只翻了一半便停住了，跳下地來，張開了嘴，滿頭是汗，襯衫的袖子高高捲起，手指因爲怕給松香黏住伸得開開的。另一部分在操塲上單調地走着的學生則比較沉靜，他們祇揮着手，作着送别的様子。那被箱子把背壓得彎彎的茶房，也停住脚放下箱子，把那在濕漉漉的砂地弄髒了的手指在白色的圍裙上揩着。瑪梭的兩頰紅艷艷的好像畫成的一様。他那幼小的小靈上第一次感到一種真實的苦惱：可是他慌亂着，不能不承認自已對於監學先生的留戀有點像對於一個親愛的表妹一様。他站得遠遠的，忐忑着，顯得不好意思的様子。威奥龍却大大方方地向他走去，但恰在這當兒大家聽到一面玻璃被撃碎的聲音。　　大家都回轉頭望着那嵌着鐵條的禁假室的小窗。紅蘿蔔鬚那醜陋而又野蠻的臉孔在那裏出現了。他做着怪臉，就像一隻關在籠裘的灰白色的小小的猛獸一様。他的頭髮覆到眼睛上，雪白的牙齒露出口外。他把他的右手從那敲破的玻璃中伸出來，顯得狠憤激的様子，揮着他那被玻璃劃破的流着血的拳頭恐嚇威奥龍。</p>
<p>「小猪！」監學先生説，「你現在滿意啦！」　　「當然啦！」紅蘿蔔鬚呌説，同時狠快活地他又一拳打碎了另一塊玻璃，一誰呌你抱吻他而不抱吻我呢？」　　他一面把那在割破了的手上流着的血塗汚着臉孔，一而補説道：　　「我也一様，我也有着紅頰呢，當我要它紅的時候！」　　虱　當大哥菲利克斯和紅蘿蔔鬚由聖瑪克書院回家時，雷辟克家的立刻便呌他們洗脚。他們三個月來就有一需要了，因爲在書院裏從來没有人給他們洗過的。這事書院的廣告上並没有任何一條提起過的。　「你這雙脚不知道黑到怎様了呢，我可憐的紅蘿蔔鬚！雷辟克家的説。」　　她猜得一點不錯。紅蘿蔔鬚的那雙脚是總比大哥菲利斯的那雙黑些。爲什麽緣故呢？兩個人在同様的制度下，在同様的空氣裏，形影不離的一塊兒生活着。當然，在三個月的盡頭，大哥菲利克斯的脚是不會白的，可是紅蘿蔔鬚呢，據他自已的告白，他簡直認不出他自已的脚了。　　因爲不好意思，他以扒手一般的靈巧，把他那雙脚連忙塞在水裏面。他脱襪子的時候旣没有讓人家看見，襪子脱完便和早已踏着桶底的大哥菲利克斯的那雙脚混在一塊。一會兒，這兩雙使人作嘔的脚十便浮起了厚厚的一層汚垢。（未完）</p>

<h3>Tang Yulin Still Sides with the Rebels</h3>
<p>Swears an Oath to Return to Rehe and Surrender to the Puppet State. His Subordinates Zhao and Liu Lead Two Brigades in Mutiny.</p>
<p>(Peiping) Representative of the people of Rehe, Han Linfu, sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, saying: "Chairman Chiang, esteemed Sir, on the 23rd, Tang Yulin swore an oath at the Koudaizi camp in Gubei to return to Rehe and surrender to the puppet state, claiming to take office as the administrative commissioner of Rehe, promising to pay each soldier ten 'guan' upon arrival in Rehe, and then led his troops east. His subordinates, cavalry brigade commander Zhao Guozeng, Shi Wenhua, and infantry brigade commander Liu Yuming, recognizing his treachery and unwilling to side with the rebels, have led their troops to the defense area of the 41st Army, declaring their willingness to lay down their arms and return to their fields, and their unwillingness to be traitors. Commander-in-Chief Sun, recognizing them as rare righteous men among Tang's troops, has shown them great care, offering them food and clothing, and instructed them to await central government disposition. I believe that the loss of the Northeast was not due to the Japanese invaders, but to warlords who harmed the country. By inciting popular resentment, they ruined national defense, eventually leading to an unchecked situation and a worsening overall situation. Even those few patriotic generals who wish to serve the nation are hesitant and restrained, unable to make a decision. These people are nominally Chinese soldiers, but in reality, they are no different from the vanguards of the Japanese invaders. Tang's greed, cruelty, and malice have deeply harmed Rehe. In his senility and confusion, he willingly acts as a traitor and is especially hateful. National defense is of utmost importance. I humbly request that you issue clear orders on how to deal with Tang and reassure Zhao and the others. The people of Rehe eagerly await your response. Han Linfu respectfully."

<h3>Wang Jingwei Discusses</h3>
<p>The Northern Situation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang said to people that the government's approach to the northern situation is still to negotiate on one hand and resist on the other, without any change. It is permissible to conduct peace negotiations under the principle of not losing sovereignty and not humiliating the country. The so-called understanding requires the other party to be sincere. If they use the threat of military force to negotiate conditions, it is absolutely impossible. The central government will never accept any agreement that compromises sovereignty.

<h3>Nanking Municipal Party Headquarters Alerts Southwestern Central Committee Members</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanking Special Municipality Executive Committee sent the following telegram to the southwestern central committee members on the 26th: "To Guangzhou's Tang Shaochuan, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zheru, Chen Bonan, Li Delin, and other committee members, I have recently seen a Reuters telegram stating that you sent a telegram to the League of Nations, the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, and the representatives of various countries stationed in China, falsely accusing the Central Government of compromising with Japan and fabricating conditions to sensationalize domestic and foreign audiences and give opportunities to the enemy. This is extremely regrettable. Since the September 18th Incident, the Central Government has been preoccupied with fighting the Japanese and suppressing the Communists, giving precedence to one over the other and exhausted in responding to both. Yet you have enjoyed a privileged position in the Southwest, uttering empty words of resistance against Japan and lofty pronouncements of suppressing the Communists, while in reality remaining bystanders throughout, and even gloating over the Central Government's troubles and exploiting the situation. In this complex and difficult situation of internal and external pressure, you have attempted to subvert the Central Government and seize power. Seeing that the Central Government's suppression of the Communists is making progress, you criticize it for not suppressing the Communists during the period of resistance against Japan, thereby emboldening the bandits and discouraging the soldiers in the Communist suppression. Seeing that the Central Government's military operations against Japan have suffered some setbacks, you criticize it for not having the determination to resist Japan, for not being willing to sacrifice, and you spread rumors that certain armies are not being supplied and that certain divisions are not being reinforced, stirring up the emotions of the anti-Japanese soldiers and destroying the will to unite sincerely. Thinking that this is not enough, you now disregard the national stance and utter irresponsible falsehoods, disregarding the nation and the people. There is no more extreme example of such unscrupulous and perverse actions. I hereby send this telegram to warn you and hope that you will wake up. Chinese Nationalist Party Nanking Special Municipality Executive Committee." (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>London Times Comments on the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The Times published an editorial today commenting on recent developments in the Far East, saying that if the Japanese army occupies Peiping, it will be a success in placing the Japanese in a troublesome position, but a ceasefire could also save the Chinese government from complete disaster. The Japanese demand to prohibit anti-Japanese movements in the Peiping area will face more serious opposition than military conditions. Although the North China authorities have not been able to destroy the resistance, they do not need to try to protect a movement that often causes conflict. The newspaper predicts that the Cantonese side, proud of its military strength, may not avoid causing trouble, but even if the Cantonese side declares independence, the Nanking government may not be more disadvantaged. The newspaper hopes that Chiang Kai-shek will implement his policy of unifying power through the cooperation of comrades. (Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<p>The Fundamental Problem Amidst the Call for Rural Relief</p>
<p>Amidst the urgent crisis in North China, the government has dedicated its efforts to organizing the Rural Rehabilitation Committee, amidst the concerns of national crisis. Amidst the sluggish commercial market, Shanghai banking circles are also putting forth their plans to maintain urban prosperity, collectively discussing the establishment of a Rural Financial Adjustment Committee to engage in rural economic relief. The severity of the rural decline and the urgent need for relief are evident today.</p>
<p>China's countryside is gradually declining under the influence of poor politics and the impact of economic recession, resulting in the current situation of impending bankruptcy. Now, the government, apprehensive that 75% of the total annual revenue may become unreliable, and the banking sector, aware that agriculture, the foundation of industry and commerce, will be unable to sustain, are jointly seeking solutions for relief. This can be seen as a harbinger of the turn of fortune for China's countryside. However, the rural problem is not a simple one; therefore, its relief cannot be entirely effective through a "treat the head when it aches, treat the foot when it hurts" approach. This is what all parties intending to help the countryside should understand today.</p>
<p>We do not oppose treating the head when it aches and the foot when it hurts, as temporarily seeking solutions for head and foot pain is still a palliative approach. However, at the same time, there must be a way to treat the root cause to engage in fundamental treatment. Currently, remedies for treating head and foot pain include discussions by the Rural Committee and deliberations by the banking sector. A newly compiled book of effective remedies can easily be published immediately. Although the effectiveness of these remedies is unknown, we can add or subtract ingredients without hesitation. Now, let us discuss the issue of fundamental treatment.</p>
<p>We believe that the fundamental problem in China's countryside today is how to transform the distinctive characteristics of China's agricultural management. According to surveys and statistics, China's cultivated land area is 1.25 billion mu, and the number of farmers is estimated to be 290 million. With this many farmers dividing this much cultivated land, the amount of land available for cultivation by each farmer is very limited. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in the seventh year of the Republic (1918), less than 31% of all farmers could obtain more than 30 mu of cultivated land, and about 27% obtained more than 10 mu. The remaining approximately 42% of farmers obtain less than 10 mu of cultivated land. Therefore, we can recognize the characteristic of China's countryside as small-scale management. This characteristic of small-scale agricultural management is the biggest reason for the vulnerability of China's countryside. People today like to talk about rural revitalization, but in fact, China's countryside was already very weak before, merely managing to maintain a semblance of stability in its weakness due to the relatively weak external forces of aggression. In recent years, the transformation of China's entire economic landscape has been very rapid, with surging trends invading the countryside, and natural and man-made disasters further reducing cultivated land, making it impossible for people to live peacefully by farming. The rural areas with small-scale agricultural management have weak resistance and cannot withstand this invasion, leading to the conspicuous phenomenon of bankruptcy. If relief is not provided immediately, the reality of bankruptcy can be seen immediately. The ways of relief, both palliative and fundamental, should be carried out simultaneously. Palliative care focuses on relieving temporary suffering, such as the plans being discussed by the government and the banking sector. Fundamental treatment lies in transforming the characteristics of China's countryside, turning China's agriculture from small-scale management to large-scale management, to increase its resistance to external aggression. Recently, there have been varying opinions in Shanghai banking circles regarding rural financial adjustment, with some advocating for concentrated efforts and others for individual initiatives. Although the discussions have not been finalized, the motivation to invest their funds in rural areas is very clear. We believe that this type of investment should allocate a portion for temporary adjustment and another portion to the goal of transforming the countryside. This transformation of the countryside is sufficient to increase rural productivity and cultivate rural resistance to external aggression. On the other hand, it is also sufficient to ensure the safety of investments.</p>

<h3>The Sino-Eastern Railway Issue</h3>
<p>A New Dispute Will Occur Between Russia and the Puppet State; Proposed Reduction of the Authority of the Russian Director and Request for Equal Treatment of Staff</p>
<p>The Japanese Government's Reply to the Russian Note Is Full of Sophistry, Inciting the Puppet State to Come Forward for Road Purchase Negotiations in Tokyo</p>
<p>(Harbin) It is expected that disputes between Russia and "Manchukuo" regarding the Sino-Eastern Railway will occur again within a few days. The "Manchukuo" authorities are now planning to propose restrictions on the authority of the Russian director and request equal treatment of Russian and "Manchukuo" staff. It is expected that these demands will cause disputes again. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>

The substantive commencement of these negotiations will be in mid-June.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Sino-Eastern Railway issue, the Japanese government released its response to the memorandum of April 16 by Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan of the Soviet Russian People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs at 4 PM this afternoon: 1. The Soviet Russian government has stated that due to the actions of "Manchukuo" officials and Japanese advisors, as well as the dispatch of Japanese officials, serious events have occurred on the Eastern Railway. In order to protect Soviet Russian rights, the Imperial Government was requested to take effective measures. Therefore, the Imperial Government ordered the dispatch of officials to investigate the facts. What has been clarified is as follows: (1) Regarding the claim that Japanese soldiers occupied the Harbin Wharf Office, due to the extreme inadequacy of the buildings since the major flood of 1921, the Japanese Army Anchorage Headquarters temporarily borrowed the buildings of the 8th and 9th wharves of the Songhua River from the Northeast Shipping Bureau of the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Transportation. There is no fact that Japanese officials seized the wharf. (2) As for the issue of transportation costs for the Japanese army, it is currently under discussion. It cannot be said that the Imperial Military intentionally delayed negotiations on this matter, and the result has worsened the finances of the Eastern Railway. The Imperial Military has already paid 2.2 million yen, as preparations for negotiations have not been established. (3) Although there are facts of bandits emerging in the eastern line of the Eastern Railway, attacking trains, and kidnapping Eastern Railway staff, the victims are not only Soviet Russians. (4) Finally, it must be said that regarding the resolution of disputes between Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo" on the Eastern Railway, the Imperial Government is awaiting negotiations between the two countries. However, the Imperial Government is paying close attention to the evolution of the dispute in accordance with the aims of the Japan-"Manchukuo" agreement. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>

The two detachments stationed in Shanghai are an integral part of the Hong Kong garrison and were sent in response to the situation in Shanghai. The total number of British troops in China remains the same, and the troops stationed in Shanghai can be reinforced from Hong Kong at any time, as quickly as in February 1932.

Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun commented on the resolution of the dispute between Peru and Colombia, saying that the successful outcome of the negotiations is cause for congratulations for the representatives of both countries. When humanity needs peace and the peaceful resolution of any dispute, no civilized person can oppose this need, otherwise they will be guilty of public anger. Today, the two countries have set an example for all to follow.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Passes</h3>
<p>Treaty Banning Poisonous Drugs</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, Geneva, 26th. The draft treaty banning the illegal trade of poisonous drugs, submitted by the League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium Trade, was passed by the Administrative Council today. The treaty consolidates existing laws and advocates punishing those who manufacture, alter, extract, refine, possess, sell, distribute, market, purchase, import, or export various drugs and materials listed in the Hague and Geneva Conventions, even if they are illegal in other countries, and also discusses the extradition of offenders.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Discusses Naval Issues</h3>
<p>Conflict Between the United States and Japan; Japanese Representative Advocates Changing the Washington and London Treaties; Britain and the United States Express Opposition</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States firmly opposes changing the Washington and London Naval Treaties and is unwilling to discuss the Japanese representative's proposal in Geneva to draft a new treaty to be included in the Disarmament Convention. Some countries in Geneva originally intended to include the Washington and London treaties in the Disarmament Convention, but Japanese representative Sato opposed this, advocating for a new treaty. The Washington Treaty stipulates a ratio of 5:5:3, and the London Treaty slightly modifies the ratio for auxiliary ships to 10:10:7, but Japan still considers this insufficient and wants to take the opportunity to demand an increase in Japan's ratio. Therefore, yesterday, it proposed amending the two treaties. Upon hearing this news, the US official field immediately expressed opposition, saying that these two treaties must be maintained until their expiration in 1936.</p>
<p>An ambassador even said that the only two modifications that the United States could agree to are: one, extending the life of the two treaties; two, further reductions. According to the US State Department, since discussions on disarmament in Geneva have already been quite difficult, and now that there is some hope of reaching an agreement, it is not appropriate to add new issues and further complicate matters. The issue of reducing naval forces may be left until after the resolution of the land disarmament and security convention. According to the Navy Department, since the United States has not yet reached the limits of the London Treaty in shipbuilding and has recently made drastic reductions, there is no problem with further reductions. Even if it becomes a reality, on the US side, it would mostly be a paper reduction, without substantive damage. Officials here also believe that Sato's proposal to amend the two treaties in Geneva is in fact aimed at expanding the scope of the talks between the US President and Ishii, as the two will discuss disarmament issues. However, it is heard that the President's intention is to limit the scope of the talks to matters currently under discussion in the Geneva General Committee, and Secretary of State Hull has also stated that the discussions will be limited to those that have been discussed with representatives of other countries in the past. (National Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, Japanese and Russian representatives harshly criticized the British proposal for maritime disarmament. The Russian representative said that this proposal not only preserves the strange inequality between countries with substantial armaments and those without large fleets but also increases this inequality. Japanese representative Sato stated that there is no need to include the London and Washington Naval Treaties in the British-proposed convention, and also stated that Japan can faithfully abide by the two treaties. British representative Eden spoke in defense of Britain's position, saying that small naval countries do not need to disarm their existing fleets, while the armaments of large naval countries must be reduced. The navy that Britain has placed has not reached the scope stipulated by the naval treaty. The convention not only creates a reduction in armaments but also stops the competition for maritime armaments. US representative Davis spoke out against the Japanese representative's suggestion that the London and Washington Naval Treaties do not need to be included in the new convention, not because it interferes with Japan's obligations, but because world opinion will be affected by it. French representative Massigli stated that the Disarmament Conference should handle maritime armaments in the same way as land armaments, with battleships reduced by 10,000 tons, with a maximum limit of 25,000 tons, and cruisers reduced by 2,000 tons, with a maximum limit of 8,000 tons. (Reuters dispatch, 25th) (Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman commented on the remarks made by Japanese representative Sato at yesterday's Disarmament Conference, saying that his remarks indicate Japan's reservation of the right to demand a higher ratio after the expiration of the London Naval Convention and a determination to advocate equality on paper. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Naval Disarmament Proposals in the Disarmament Convention</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The British naval disarmament proposal debated at today's Disarmament Conference is included under the naval armament section of the British draft treaty, which explains the reductions and restrictions already implemented since the Washington and London Treaties were established, and then proposes extending the cessation of battleship construction to all types of warships. However, if Italy wishes to increase construction, it may still build a ship. France, since the start of the Disarmament Conference, has already started building the warship Dunkerque in 1932. It also stipulates that, in addition to those listed in the London Naval Convention, cruisers with 8-inch guns may not be built again. Other construction is purely for replenishment and should be subject to the qualitative restrictions in the naval treaty. As for Germany, it can remove the restrictions on naval restrictions in the Treaty of Versailles. However, the draft treaty actually stabilizes its naval status until the end of 1936, as it is today. The treaty stipulates that Germany should abide by the cessation of battleship construction, and other construction is purely for replenishment. The qualitative restrictions in the Treaty of Versailles have been deleted. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Definition of "Aggressor State"</h3>
<p>Britain and France Clash Again; France Advocates Strict Regulations; Britain Opposes</p>
<p>(Geneva) Polish and French disarmament representatives today both acknowledged that British Under-Secretary of State Eden's statement that Britain does not approve of formulating a strict and automatic definition of aggressor states was unexpected by the two countries. Eden stated that the definition of an aggressor state may be very broad in the agreement. In the future, signatory countries should use the circumstances in which the dispute arises as a guide when making decisions, and said that the United States also does not advocate a strict definition and will support Britain's position. Afterwards, the French representative told reporters that the French government believes that formulating certain rules and defining aggressor states is the core of all security treaties. France wants to use this definition as a basis for reducing armaments, so it advocates that the agreement should clearly explain the various actions that should be considered aggression. If there is such an explanation, France will feel that it can work effectively. The Polish representative also stated that Poland is deeply concerned about certain types of aggression, so it supports the French position, and it is heard that the representatives of France and Poland also advocate that concentrating troops on the border or conducting large-scale maneuvers on the border should also be regarded as acts of aggression and should be prohibited. Otherwise, at least it should be considered sufficiently serious to warrant consultation. (National Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the meeting of the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference this afternoon, British representative Eden expressed disagreement with the definition of "aggressor state" set by the Security Committee, saying that this definition can be considered but cannot form a fixed and strict standard for what constitutes an aggressor state. In difficult cases, this strict definition will be absolutely detrimental. On Wednesday, the Security Committee defined aggression as (1) declaring war, (2) attacking without declaring war, (3) attacking ships or aircraft by sea, land, or air, (4) naval blockade of ports, (5) assisting armed groups invading other countries.

<h3>Japan Promises Not to Invade China?</h3>
<p>England Believes Japan Has Not Fulfilled Its Promises to the United States</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon will explain the issue of disarmament and the situation of the Four-Power Treaty to Parliament tomorrow. The general public continues to hope that the Four-Power Treaty can be signed, but the actions of the Little Entente countries in diplomacy undoubtedly reduce optimism. The general public hopes that France can support the Four-Power Treaty, as it is the only effective way to prevent the unity of Germany and Italy. The goal of British policy lies in this. Regarding security issues, the British Foreign Secretary originally intended to discuss them with French Prime Minister Daladier, but the meeting has been postponed. In addition, some people in Geneva have requested revisions to the naval treaty in order to reduce naval forces. This proposal is not very welcomed here, because various naval powers have already reduced their navies. If other countries do not follow suit, how can those that have already reduced their forces be asked to reduce them again? Regarding Japan's special circumstances, some say that the United States had promised not to set up fortresses in strategic locations in the Pacific in exchange for Japan promising not to attack China. British sources believe that since Japan has not fulfilled this verbal agreement, it is difficult to approve the proposal by Japanese disarmament representative Sato to reduce tonnage.

<h3>British Parliament Overcrowded to Hear Simon's Report</h3>
<p>French Representative's Remarks Cause Great Doubt, Germany's Withdrawal of Amendments is Crucial</p>
<p>(London) The close attention paid to the recent developments of the Disarmament Conference can be seen from the crowding in the public gallery of the House of Commons today. British Foreign Secretary Simon returned by plane from Geneva yesterday and attended the House of Commons today to defend the British disarmament draft treaty. The general public wants to hear his remarks. Simon said that this draft treaty is</p>
<h3>Will the Disarmament Conference End Temporarily?</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The opinions of the Berlin newspapers all believe that the Disarmament Conference will end temporarily and adjourn until the autumn. The Berlin local newspaper reported news from Geneva, saying that there are rumors there that before the Disarmament Conference adjourns, it will pass a final resolution on the issue of security and management plans. It is heard that the resolution will contain clauses reiterating the prohibition of Germany from rearming. The resolution will not mention the actual plan for disarmament. The German side in Geneva believes that the German government will never recognize the resolution. The Vossische Zeitung recorded yesterday's naval debate in Geneva, saying that the opinions of the major naval powers are clearly divided. These differences may not be eliminated before the opening of the World Economic Conference. (Guomin dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>a complete and systematic plan that does not avoid difficulties. If</p>
<p>you want to deal with this problem without further delay, then the most effective method is none other than this. Since the proposal of this draft treaty, everyone has been discussing nothing but this. From this, it can be seen that this treaty is an effective tool. The attitude of the United States is particularly welcome, but it must be made clear to all countries that this treaty will only help security after practical disarmament. The US representative Davis's statement that the United States is prepared to amend the wartime US neutrality law under certain circumstances is very important, because the United States has expressed its abandonment of its attitude of only watching from the sidelines, and has abandoned its traditional policy. Therefore, if a war occurs, and one side is an aggressor, the United States will effectively use its power. Although real progress is underway in Geneva, signs of disturbance still exist. Now, because it is inconvenient to criticize certain specific remarks, some recent discussions have caused great doubts among peace-loving people around the world. Hitler's words are moderate and appropriate, which is very welcome, but it is foolish not to admit that words and actions are not entirely consistent. The amendments proposed by Germany in Geneva are sufficient to undermine the future of disarmament, but the German side has withdrawn them, which can also be regarded as an important event. The British Foreign Secretary finally said that Britain has greatly reduced its armaments, and cannot reduce them further without a general agreement. Britain has expressed its willingness to participate in consultations with the United States in order to enhance security, but Britain cannot assume further responsibilities such as the Locarno Treaty.

<h3>Little Entente and Poland Respond with Moderation to the Four-Power Pact</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Since Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić issued a declaration, it is generally believed that it can represent the intentions of the Little Entente countries, which is a moderate expression after the people of those countries discussed the Four-Power Pact with French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour. It seems that Poland's view of the Four-Power Pact may also change. It is heard that French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour plans to return to Paris on Sunday afternoon, and will report on the Four-Power Pact negotiations in accordance with the wishes of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. This pact cannot be signed until it has been discussed by the governments of various countries. In short, there can be no decision before the end of next week. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3>US-Japan Continue Talks</h3>
<p>Japanese Representatives Use Disarmament as a Weapon to Coerce the United States to Recognize Manchukuo and Negotiate Economic Issues with Hull. Ishii Expresses Satisfactory Results</p>
<p>(Washington) Tonight, President Roosevelt and Japanese representative Viscount Ishii held extremely important talks. Roosevelt received a telegram from Davis from Geneva, reporting that the attitude adopted by the Japanese delegation at the Disarmament Conference specifically requested Ishii to ask the Tokyo government to change its position on the Disarmament Conference. Ishii replied that he was willing to convey this intention to Tokyo, but if the United States could not consider the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo" with a sympathetic attitude, then the Japanese government would find it difficult to change its position on the disarmament issue. Roosevelt said that the issue of "Manchukuo" recognition was not within the scope of the current work in Geneva. Roosevelt then said that once the reply from Tokyo arrived, he would schedule another meeting. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese representative to the World Economic Conference Ishii, along with the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and the Vice President of the Bank of Japan, called on Secretary of State Hull today to discuss economic and financial issues related to the Economic Conference. Dr. Hornbeck, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department, also attended. After the meeting this morning, Ishii had tea with Hull and then had a secret talk with President Roosevelt. When asked about the situation of the meeting by Ishii, he wanted to reveal something, but said that he would probably have to talk with President Roosevelt again tomorrow. Tonight, the US authorities will hold a formal banquet to entertain the Japanese representatives. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese representatives Ishii, Fukai, and Ambassador Debuchi visited Secretary of State Hull on the 25th to exchange views on various important issues of the Economic Conference. Ishii told reporters after the meeting that today's meeting discussed the important basic issues of the Economic Conference, and the results were quite satisfactory. He plans to visit Hull again tomorrow morning. (Nichi-Rengo dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times stated that it is heard that President Roosevelt has asked Japanese representative Ishii to frankly explain Japan's attitude towards the abolition of offensive weapons, the definition of "aggressor," and Japan's opposition to the maritime disarmament methods in the British draft treaty. The State Department believes that the new demands made by Japan in Geneva are mostly of a bargaining nature, and stated that the London Naval Treaty is applicable until 1936. It is heard that when Japanese representatives discussed economic matters with the US President, there were no major differences of opinion on the issue of the World Economic Conference. However, the Japanese representatives have always been cautious, expressing their consent with conditions attached, in order to avoid conflicts with the situation in China. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Ridicule Japan</h3>
<p>Damaging Peace and Discrediting Its Reputation</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Post's editorial stated that it is very inappropriate to underestimate the importance of President Roosevelt's talk with Ishii at a time when the United States is trying to maintain peace and Japan is implementing economic and military policies that offend various countries. Japan's invasion of China has created a situation that threatens world peace, and may even turn the World Economic Conference into a child's play. If Japan's occupation of China is not dared to be questioned, then the disarmament agreement concluded in Geneva to stipulate common actions against aggressors will not only be useless, but will be even worse than useless. Japan intends to maintain the trust of various countries on the one hand, and resolutely implements its policies to undermine peace and the treaties to protect China's security on the other hand. It is now facing increasing difficulties. Everyone suspects whether Japan is willing to maintain the sanctity of treaties. This suspicion has greatly damaged Japan's reputation, and will make various countries have to be cautious in their future dealings with Japan. The United States hopes that the talks between Roosevelt and Ishii will make Japan understand that it is more valuable to understand non-aggression and faithfully abide by treaties than to implement its current policies, so as to fundamentally change Japan's policies. In addition, the Washington Evening Star's editorial stated that unless Japan unites with countries that avoid using aggression as a tool of national policy, Ishii must know that various countries cannot have true friendship and trust with Japan, and will not give it true friendship and trust.

<h3>US Republican Congressman Impeaches Treasury Secretary Woodin</h3>
<p>Morgan Case Involves Former President Coolidge, New York Newspaper Advocates Amending Income Tax Law</p>
<p>Guomin Washington dispatch on the 25th It is a Republican claim that the Democratic government, having declared its determination to impartially root out malfeasance in the securities market and reform the banking system, is now in danger of being hoist with its own petard. Shortly after President Roosevelt took office, he ordered the Justice Department to thoroughly investigate all complaints regarding banking fraud. While the Senate had previously shown little interest in the matter, under Democratic leadership, it has now enthusiastically taken up the investigation. The results of the investigation into the Morgan Bank have revealed shocking secrets, many of which are unfavorable to the Democratic Party. Today's shocking news is that former Democratic National Committee Chairman Raskob personally signed a letter to Morgan Bank shareholders, containing words of gratitude. Raskob was known for his aggressive fundraising tactics for the party. While Raskob has not explained his signed letter of thanks, it is reported that he borrowed funds from Morgan Bank in his personal capacity for the use of the Democratic Party. Therefore, Republicans have hinted that a continued investigation may reveal that Morgan donated funds to the Democratic Party, as Morgan has long been recognized as a Republican figure. Furthermore, after it was discovered that Treasury Secretary Woodin and Ambassador to Europe Davis had purchased stocks issued by Morgan Bank at prices far lower than the market price in 1919 and resold them for profit, Senators Robinson and Congressman Britten respectively demanded in both houses that Woodin and Davis resign. While this behavior is not illegal, and Davis was originally a banker and businessman, it is believed that Morgan's granting of this special privilege was a form of gift. Why would Morgan give this gift? There must be an understanding in between. Therefore, the two are no longer suitable to serve the public. Both Robinson and Britten are Republican leaders, and Woodin was originally a Republican, and Davis was also trusted by President Hoover, so this move is not without partisan flavor. In addition, another shocking piece of news revealed today is that Morgan himself has not paid any income tax to the US government for the past three years, while he has paid approximately 7,000 pounds in income tax to the British government each year as a result of his business in England. Furthermore, after leaving office, former President Coolidge, along with Woodin, Lindbergh, and others, also purchased Studebaker stocks from Morgan Bank at low prices and sold them on the market, making huge profits. Since the release of this news, public opinion across the country has been extremely激昂. Newspapers have stated that while there have been suspicions of such scandals in the past, there has never been proof of someone in a business position using improper means to profit in the market at the expense of the public.</p>
<p>Reuters Washington dispatch on the 25th American banker Morgan continued to be interrogated today, with a large crowd of onlookers. The venue was changed to a larger hall. The House Ways and Means Committee ordered an investigation into the profits and losses of funds and the provisions of the income tax law in order to amend the clauses that allowed Morgan to not pay income tax in 1931 and 1932. During today's hearing, it was discovered that deceased President Coolidge was also one of Morgan Bank's "birthday accounts," enjoying the benefit of purchasing securities at cost after retiring from office. Shareholder Whitney admitted that he profited $166,250 in 1929 by purchasing securities at cost from Morgan Bank. It was then discovered that since the European War, Morgan has sold more than 6 billion yuan in various bonds, of which 2 billion yuan were sold to foreigners.</p>
<p>Reuters New York dispatch on the 25th After studying the facts revealed in the Morgan case, the New York Evening Post published an article advocating that American income tax should follow the British method and make the rich and poor bear different burdens. The newspaper stated that American income tax law allows for the deduction of capital depreciation or securities losses from taxable income. Therefore, Morgan did not pay income tax in 1931 and 1932, while its properties in England paid taxes as usual, because there is no deduction law in England.</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Decides to Sever Ties with Current Cabinet</h3>
<p>Opposing Saito's Reluctance to Relinquish Power, Political Star Uga visits Tokyo</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo dispatch on the 26th Yesterday afternoon, the Seiyukai executive committee held a meeting to discuss its attitude towards the government. As a result, its attitude suddenly hardened. The details are as follows: First, President Suzuki reported on the content of his meeting with the Finance Minister and the so-called tacit understanding between the two. Based on this, the party discussed its future attitude. Secretary-General Machida strongly advocated severing ties with the government, saying, "We did not think of the Finance Minister's resignation as a time for political change, but we believe that Saito's cabinet has completed its mission and will definitely resign. Now the government is only talking about extending the life of the cabinet and not giving up its reluctance to relinquish power, so the Seiyukai must make a major decision." Then, Ando Masazumi said, "I agree with severing ties, but from a policy perspective, the best time to do so is during the budget compilation period." Then, Mr. Sunada said, "Our party has always adopted a position of neither close nor distant to the government, which has lost the trust of the people. At this time, we should resolutely and clearly raise the flag and immediately sever ties." Then, Uchida Nobuya asked, "If we sever ties, what about the advancement and retreat of party members in the government?" Sunada replied, "They should be ordered to resign in accordance with the party's decision." Uchida asked, "What about the Finance Minister?" Sunada replied, "As a party member, he naturally understands." Finally, Kanbara Den advocated self-respect, and the resolution was unanimously passed as follows: "Although the Saito cabinet has issued a statement of renewal, we believe that it has no ability to handle the extraordinary situation based on past experience. At this time, our party should bravely move forward from its own position, based on national and policy principles."</p>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo dispatch on the 26th Regarding the Seiyukai's</p>
<p>problem of severing ties with the cabinet, the Minseito's observations are as follows: "Although it has decided to sever ties with the cabinet, there are self-respect theories from Kuhara and Tokonami within the Seiyukai. Whether they can coexist is questionable. If they sever ties, they will negotiate with individual members of the Seiyukai to join the cabinet. If they are rejected, they can be supplemented by the upper house." That is, the Minseito is taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the Seiyukai's policy of severing ties, while guarding against the emergence of a pro-Tokonami's theory of a coalition cabinet of political parties within the party.</p>

At 6:00 PM on the 25th, a strong northeast wind blew, and the sky over Toyohara was covered in black smoke, which was very tragic.</p>
<p>Nichi-Rengo, Toyohara dispatch on the 26th Forest fires are still burning in various parts of Sakhalin Island. On the afternoon of the 24th, a fire broke out again in the mountains of Motomari Village. Due to the strong southwest wind, the fire was extremely fierce. In an instant, a large forest of more than thirty miles was completely burned. By 2:00 PM on the 25th, the fire had destroyed houses near the railway and is now pressing towards Shiritori Town. The fire is getting fiercer and there is no hope of extinguishing it. According to information from various sources, the Kakiho area was completely destroyed and the fate of 350 residents is unknown due to the loss of escape routes. The Higashi-Rei settlement is also in danger. All the men have been mobilized to fight the fire, and 200 women have taken a temporary train to evacuate.</p>
<h3>War Zone Refugees Gather in Tianjin and Beijing</h3>
<p>Tianjin and Beijing are Safe, Precautions are Strict, Charities are Eager to Provide Relief to Refugees</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beijing In recent days, the number of refugees fleeing from the war zone to Tianjin and Beijing has been very large. Various charitable organizations have been trying to accommodate them and provide emergency relief. Currently, Tianjin and Beijing are still calm and public order can be guaranteed. A battle took place in Ninghe a few days ago and was captured by the Japanese army. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Ninghe Falls</h3>
<p>On the 23rd at dawn, over two hundred Japanese soldiers at Jiangwakou, fifteen li north of Ninghe, attacked our forward哨 troops. Our cavalry unit was forced to engage, and after holding out until dusk, they repelled the Japanese. On the 24th at dawn, about six or seven hundred puppet troops, carrying four or five field and mountain guns and five or six mortars, launched a fierce attack on Ninghe from three directions. Our unit fought for several hours, with two platoon leaders killed and one wounded, along with over twenty soldiers killed or wounded. The battle was extremely intense. The enemy then gathered civilian boats from east of the river, using intense artillery fire to cover infantry crossing the river. Our troops, under excessive pressure, retreated into the city, leading to street fighting. Due to heavy losses, Ninghe fell into enemy hands. Our unit retreated to Xiguan but did not counterattack. The Japanese concentrated five or six thousand puppet troops east of Ninghe. Their intent seems to be to seize Ninghe to control our Lutai. If we want to retake Ninghe, it will inevitably lead to fierce fighting. At that time, the Japanese will likely use the puppet troops as a pretext to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>[P Beiping Security</p>
<p>Recently, although Japanese planes have occasionally flown over Beiping, they have not dropped bombs, so the area remains relatively calm. While many residents who sought refuge are returning south, a significant number of refugees from the front lines are also arriving in Beiping. Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee, and He Yingqin, Acting Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, convened a meeting of key military and police officials, including Zhang Qun, Jiang Bocheng, Wang Shuchang, Bao Yulin, and Shao Wenkai, at Fengzeyuan at 10:00 AM on the 24th. They discussed Beiping's security measures in detail and dispersed around noon. The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching. In previous years, Beiping was exceptionally lively, with festive foods piled high like mountains. This year, affected by the current situation, the market is unusually depressed, with few shoppers. Merchants are less enthusiastic about preparing for the festival than in previous years, and fewer people are buying zongzi. Many shops are closing due to the depressed business. According to recent surveys, approximately two hundred and forty to fifty businesses have reported closing, especially apartments. The Beiping Municipal Government has noted that cars frequently hit and kill pedestrians in the city, and leaflets are distributed from cars without license plates, running at night without lights and at high speed, making it difficult for the police to identify and arrest them. Therefore, it is necessary for military and political authorities to jointly issue a strict ban to maintain public order and ensure public safety. The Municipal Government has drafted a joint announcement and sent it to the Beiping Garrison Headquarters for review and approval before implementation. Since the situation became tense, hotels in the East Legation Quarter have been overcrowded. The Management Committee of the Legation Quarter, for security purposes, has ordered the police to carefully inspect the hotels within the Quarter daily. Since yesterday, all patrol officers have been ordered to rigorously check pedestrians and vehicles entering the Quarter, including opening and inspecting suitcases and packages. It is said that this is to prevent unscrupulous individuals from using the Legation Quarter as a base to plot wrongdoing.</p>
<h3>Activities of Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Recently, a rumor spread in the city that Japanese residents in Beiping were concentrating in the East Legation Quarter, causing great concern among the citizens. According to investigations, Japanese residents are not preparing to concentrate. However, the Japanese Embassy has established a vault and notified Japanese residents that they can send valuable items to the vault for safekeeping from 8:00 AM on the 25th to prevent losses. As a result, many Japanese residents are preparing to send their valuables to the embassy for safekeeping. Outsiders, unaware of the true situation, mistakenly believed that Japanese residents were ordered to concentrate. Furthermore, the Japanese side requested the Beiping military and police authorities to deploy twenty patrolling soldiers outside the Legation Quarter in the area of Dong Chang'an Street adjacent to the Japanese Embassy barracks to patrol for protection. Our military and police authorities replied that Chang'an Street is under the protection of our police, and there is no need for Japanese soldiers to add patrolling soldiers outside the Legation Quarter to avoid misunderstandings. It is reported that the Japanese side has understood the situation as a result of negotiations and has withdrawn the request.</p>
<h3>Relief for Refugees</h3>
<p>The Nan City Refugee Shelter is located in the South Building of the New World (Xin Shi Jie). It currently houses over two hundred refugees. Bao Yulin provides rice and flour, and the government subsidizes coal and firewood expenses by one hundred yuan per month, which has been sustained for over two months. Now that local associations are planning to set up fifteen refugee shelters, the New World, with its spacious buildings, will merge the shelter run by Wang Xiuting with the local association and rename it the First War Zone Refugee Shelter. It currently houses refugees from Huairou, Yutian, Shunyi, Tongxian, and other places, approximately</p>
<p>over two hundred people. However, since the refugees are coming to Beiping from the war zone, the shelter fears it will not be able to accommodate them. Therefore, it has contacted the temporary women and children refugee shelter of the Red Swastika Society (i.e., the First Shelter) to take over the North Building of the New World to establish the Second War Zone Refugee Shelter. According to investigations, the First Refugee Shelter established by the Red Swastika Society in the North Building of the New World outside Qianmen, in addition to transferring 191 refugees to the Society's Guanghua Temple Fifth Shelter on the 22nd, currently has forty-nine male refugees, forty-five female refugees, and forty-four children, totaling one hundred and thirty-eight people. According to Mr. Shi, a staff member of the shelter, the shelter officially began accepting refugees on February 16th, with varying numbers of arrivals and departures, reaching over five hundred people at peak times. Food is supplied by the Swastika Society, with two meals a day of cornbread, millet porridge, and pickles, with unlimited portions. For lodging, the shelter provides straw mats, and the refugees bring their own bedding. For medical issues, there is a Chinese medicine doctor, Bian Yangsu, who provides treatment, with the cost of medicine reported to the Society. In case of death, the Society provides coffins for those over fifteen years old, while refugees provide their own for those under fifteen, and all costs for carrying and burial are borne by the refugees. Currently, the weather is warm, and the New World building is spacious and well-ventilated. On average, only two or three people, mostly children, fall ill each day. However, a boy died yesterday due to a rash and exposure to the wind. Since the shelter began accepting refugees, a total of three children have died. Furthermore, because many parts of the New World building are leaking, the shelter plans to move to a certain location in the grain store. The old site will be vacated for the local association to establish the Second War Zone Refugee Shelter.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Martial Law</h3>
<p>On the night of the 24th, security on the roads of Tianjin was even tighter than in previous days. The curfew, which had been extended to 9:00 PM on the night of the 23rd, was moved forward to 8:00 PM on the night of the 24th. Trolleys returned to the depot at 7:00 PM. The city was quiet and deserted, with few pedestrians. In the Japanese concession, near the Miyajima Post Office, Japanese residents were still watching from the roadside with their children. Plainclothes agents were secretly deployed in a certain concession. Due to the strict precautions taken by the Tianjin military and police authorities, traitors dared not venture into the southeast corner of the city. Tianjin remains peaceful.</p>
<h3>Refugees Gather</h3>
<p>The counties of Xianghe, Wuqing, and Baodi in northeastern Beiping are all close to the war zone. To seek safety, the people of these counties have mostly abandoned their homes and fields in pain, bringing the old and the young to seek refuge in Beiping and Tianjin. Refugees are continuously arriving, especially in the Yangcun and Meichang areas, and many refugees have gathered in the suburbs of Tianjin. On the night of the 24th, several thousand more people arrived near the French barracks in Dongjuzi, sleeping in the open and exposed to the elements, a truly miserable sight. Fortunately, Mr. Zhang, a kind-hearted owner of a Western cloth shop in the area, generously provided dozens of bundles of reed mats, hiring workers to build makeshift shelters so that the refugees could find some protection from the wind and rain. Upon hearing the news, the Tianjin Charity Committee immediately convened a temporary meeting with the Social Affairs Bureau, the Local Association, the Red Swastika Society, and the Red Cross Society at the Charity Association at approximately 8:00 AM on the 25th to discuss relief measures. Representatives present included Zhao Pingqing, Deputy Chairman of the Charity Association; Yong Jianqiu, Committee Member; Chen Xisan, representative of the Local Association; Zhang Ziyuan of the Red Swastika Society; Liu Daoping of the Red Cross Society; Jiang Zhilin of the Autonomous Region; and Li Ming and Zhang Zheng of the Social Affairs Bureau, among others, totaling over ten people. During the meeting, the following temporary measures for reception and relief were tentatively decided: (1) Temporarily build reed mat shelters in the original location, with the Red Swastika Society and the Red Cross Society assigning special personnel to reside there and take care of the refugees. (2) For relief matters, the Charity Association will temporarily distribute 10,000 jin of corn flour for consumption. After the discussion, the representatives went to Dongjuzi to inspect the refugee situation. Mr. Zhang Wanquan, a local notable, was responsible for the reception and promised to assist with the charitable organizations and relevant authorities. The Charity Association of the Municipal Autonomous Organization, upon receiving a report, immediately dispatched Wang Molin, the head of the First Autonomous Region, and Zhang Ziyuan, the social director of the Red Swastika Society, to inspect the area by car that evening. Seeing that the reed mats of the shelters were thin, and that they would certainly leak if it rained, and that the refugees had fled empty-handed and lacked food, the Red Swastika Society transported a large number of reed mats to reinforce the roofs of the shelters, so that they could withstand storms. They also rushed to provide urgent relief to avoid the refugees suffering from hunger. After returning from the inspection, Mr. Wang Molin made four suggestions to the Red Swastika Society: (1) The refugee shelters are connected in rows and columns, stretching endlessly. If one is not careful and a fire breaks out, it could spread rapidly. Proper prevention measures should be taken to ensure safety. (2) The shelters are all built with thin reed mats. During the summer season, if there is continuous rain, they will not only leak, but also collapse. Methods should be found to thicken them with mud. (3) The refugees in the shelters are all sleeping on damp soil. Over time, epidemics may break out. More preventative medicines should be prepared to value life. (4) Since the port is a mix of all kinds of people, with varying degrees of goodness, there is no guarantee that bandits will not come, using sweet words to seduce and abduct refugee children for sale. Investigation specialists should be stationed to inspect and ensure they cannot mix in, to maintain peace of mind. Furthermore, the Charity Association of the Autonomous Organization reported yesterday that a large number of refugees had gathered in Beicang, without food or lodging. They requested relief. The Association dispatched the field director Kang Zhenpu to invite the local gentry to establish a shelter to accommodate as many as possible. However, this relief effort requires substantial funds, and a meeting of the district heads will be convened within days to discuss and quickly raise large sums of money to maintain the effort in the long term. The Civil Affairs Department of Hebei Province, considering the loss of Luandong and various passes of the Great Wall, and the miserable situation of the refugees who have lost their homes, and while charitable organizations have provided relief, the greatest difficulty is transportation. It has been heard that in order to provide proper relief, temporary and long-term assistance measures have been established for charitable organizations. The temporary assistance measures are that when charitable organizations rescue and transport refugees from the war zone, the Civil Affairs Department will telegraph the local authorities, instructing the police to protect them at all times, send them to the nearest transfer station, and send a letter to the relevant railway bureau to provide free transportation to the rear for accommodation. As for long-term temporary assistance measures, the Provincial Government has telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, instructing the railway bureaus in the war zone to provide free transportation for charitable organizations rescuing war refugees, provided they have a license. In addition, regarding the expansion of accommodation measures, negotiations are currently underway with charitable organizations to prepare to set up large-scale long-term accommodation centers to provide comfort and relief to refugees.

<h3>Bird's-Eye View of Bandit Suppression in Five Provinces</h3>
<p>Three Route Headquarters Established in Succession Military Commission Jiangxi Operational Headquarters Officially Opened</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang's current stay in Jiangxi is to supervise the Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei armies, divided into three routes—South, West, and North—for bandit suppression. The three route headquarters have been established in succession, and the Nanchang Operational Headquarters of the Military Commission has also taken over the headquarters of the Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces and officially opened for business. The staff of the operational headquarters was fully announced yesterday, and anti-Japanese bandit suppression work is extremely intense. The situation of bandit suppression in each route is described separately below.</p>
<h3>Western Route</h3>
<p>The Western Route Commander, He Jian, was originally scheduled to take office on the 20th, but due to insufficient preparation, it was changed to take the oath on the 1st of next month. The route includes the Jiangxi West, Hunan East, and Hubei South defense areas, a total of 37 counties. Approximately fifteen or sixteen divisions are under He's command, divided into three columns. The first column commander is He himself, the second column commander is Liu Jianxu, and the third column commander is Guo Rudong. For He's convenience in command, he also sent Zhang Tieqing to organize the Commander-in-Chief's Operational Headquarters in Pingxiang. The internal staff will be announced soon. Since He transferred the Wang Dongyuan, Peng Wei, Chen Guangzhong, and Tao Guang units into Jiangxi, the encirclement and suppression of Li Tianzhu's bandit group, the Eighth Pseudo Army in Jiangxi West, and the Kong Hechong Pseudo Sixth Army Corps and the Pseudo Sixteenth and Eighteenth Armies in Jiangxi North and Hubei South have been quite successful. Recently, in the Lianhua Gaolong campaign, the Chen and Wang divisions completely defeated the Eighth Pseudo Army, killing thousands of bandits. The Sixteenth and Eighteenth Armies in Wanzai were also driven away by Liu Jianxu and fled to Hubei South. Chiang has separately ordered certain units to block the routes.</p>
<h3>Northern Route</h3>
<p>Since Liu Zhi returned to Henan, the establishment of the headquarters for the Northern Route is still far from sight. The Fuzhou Bandit Suppression Commissioner's Office has been abolished. Military bandit suppression in Jiangxi East is temporarily under the concurrent direction of Chairman Chiang's Operational Headquarters. The Pseudo First, Third, and Fifth Army Corps, previously gathered in Yihuang, Chongren, and Le'an,</p>
<p>no longer have any openings to exploit in Fuzhou. Aircraft from the Third and Fourth Aviation Squadrons fly daily to the bandit areas, continuously dropping bombs and bombing the bandit nests. Zhu Mao hides during the day and comes out at night, retreating southward. The Pseudo organs in Ningdu and Ruijin have been completely destroyed by our bombing. The people are extremely panicked. Rice costs four sheng per yuan, and salt costs one liang and a half per jiao, and it is still impossible to buy. The bandits' supplies are in a desperate situation. Therefore, the bandits have moved west again. The Pseudo First and Fifth Armies are concentrating in Tengtian, Yongfeng, seemingly planning to temporarily avoid the eastern bank of the Gan River in the Ji'an area, and attempting to develop on both banks of the Gan River.</p>
<h3>Southern Route</h3>
<p>After the Southern Route was completely taken by the bandits, it was jointly suppressed by the Guangdong and Guangxi armies, taking Ruijin from Huichang, Yudu, and Xingguo and cutting off its base. According to Li Shangyong, the representative of the Eighth Guangdong Army stationed in Jiangxi, the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have a total of seven divisions, which have all arrived at the corresponding locations. Chen has sent people to organize the Southern Route Commander-in-Chief's Operational Headquarters in Nanxiong, which will be established soon. Since all circles in Jiangxi have suffered from banditry for a long time, and the elimination of the Red bandits cannot be achieved unless Guangdong and Guangxi attack the rear of the bandits, there is great hope for Guangdong and Guangxi to reinforce their troops and for Chen and Bai to become commanders-in-chief of the Southern Route. Chairman Chiang also sends telegrams from time to time to urge this matter, which is related to the overall success or failure of bandit suppression, so that the five provinces and three routes can join forces, eliminate Zhu Mao, complete the task of bandit suppression, and concentrate on resisting Japan.

<h3>Jinan Library Preserves Song Dynasty Buddhist Treasure Sarira</h3>
<p>Approximately One Sheng, Sorting Has Begun</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: A Song Renzong era temple was discovered in Lingxian, northern Shandong, yielding numerous antiquities. They have now been transported to the Provincial Library by the Daming Lake in Jinan for preservation. Besides bronze mirrors and ancient coins, there are also approximately one sheng of transparent, bean-sized pebbles. Initially, they did not attract much attention, but now, after verification by the library director Wang Xiantang, it is known that they are sarira, the unique treasure of Buddhism, which has valuable historical significance. The library has begun to sort them carefully. (Because the sarira are mixed with many fragments of silver, they must be carefully selected) and solemnly preserved. According to the library director Wang Xiantang, there are two types of Buddhist sarira: one is Buddha bones, and they are discovered after the cremation of an Arhat who has attained enlightenment, as recorded in the Shi Shi Yao Lan [Essentials of the Sakya Clan], "After Sakyamuni passed away, his disciples Ananda and others cremated his body, and there were bone relics like five-colored pearls, bright, solid, and firm, called sarira, and pagodas were built to store them." The other type emerges from the ground. According to the inscriptions on the stone coffin discovered this time, the sensory sarira emerged from the incense burner of the Qianming Temple, and the local monks joyfully worshiped them, raising funds to place them in a silver box, which was placed in a stone coffin, and building a brick shrine for the worship of devout men and women from all directions. The fragments of silver and small Buddha statues in the stone coffin are fragments of the broken silver box and its decorations. There is also an octagonal object, slightly smaller than a monk's hat, which is the top of the lid. It is unknown when they were buried underground, and only now have they been discovered. The Buddha bones mentioned in Han Yu's Memorial on the Bone of the Buddha are sarira. Jingjieshu Temple in the eastern part of Jinan once welcomed a sarira from Tibet. The monks and lay Buddhists reverently welcomed it into the temple and worshiped it as the ultimate treasure. The sarira discovered in Lingxian this time amounts to almost one sheng and is a relic from the Song Dynasty, its preciousness is self-evident. (25th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Armies of Three Provinces Advance Towards Hunan Border</h3>
<p>Nineteenth Route Advance Contingent Arrives in Yizhang Fourth Independent Guangdong Division Departs Daily from Lechang Guangxi Twenty-Fourth Division Departs from Guilin</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the anti-Japanese vanguard contingent of the Nineteenth Route Army departed from northern Guangdong to Lechang, they temporarily remained in the area on the 17th, waiting for the full arrival of the Fourth Independent Guangdong Division before advancing towards the Hunan border. Before the 18th, the Youth Service Corps that departed with the Nineteenth Route Army expanded anti-Japanese propaganda in the Lechang area. Corps members went to various villages to give speeches about the aggressive ambitions of violent Japan. The masses were exceptionally excited, vowing to be the rearguard of the anti-Japanese army, and those who came to welcome them with food and drink were endless. After the first column of the Nineteenth Route Army conducted live ammunition shooting exercises in Lechang, they continued to advance to Pingshi. It was heard that they arrived in Pingshi at Shenshi (3-5 pm) on the 18th. The forward troops, the two regiments of Wu Lüshun and Xie Dingxin, began moving into Yizhang on the 19th. Because a portion of the First Column's baggage and military supplies lacked porters for transportation, they were delayed until the 18th before being transported from Shaozhou to Lechang by several motor vehicles. Since the Anti-Japanese Contingent of the 19th Route Army had been in Lechang for many days, the Guangdong authorities specially issued a directive to expedite the departure of the 4th Independent Division from the province. It was verified that the 1st Regiment of the Division, commanded by Pan Biao, had departed on the 5 pm special train from Guangzhou-Shaozhou on the 17th and reported its arrival in Shaozhou by telegram. The 2nd Regiment, commanded by Zhang Haodong, continued to travel north by train at 2 pm on the 20th. On the 21st, the Guangzhou-Shaozhou Railway Bureau dispatched two more train cars to specifically transport the military supplies and baggage of the Division. The 3rd Regiment, commanded by Zhao Lan, continued to depart on the 22nd. The staff of the Division is scheduled to complete their departure by the 27th. After the 1st Regiment of the Division concentrates in Shaozhou, they will depart from Shaozhou to Libutou and proceed to Lechang, following the vanguard of the 19th Route Army to advance towards the Hunan border. As for the anti-Japanese army dispatched by Guangxi Province, it is the 24th Division, commanded by Tan Lianfang. It is reported that they have concentrated in Guilin to carry out replenishments. Li Zongren arrived in Guilin on the 18th with Ye Qi, Chief of Staff of the Fourth Army Group, to inspect Tan's Division and give speeches to the officers and soldiers of the unit. Tan's Division departed from Guilin on the 20th in two batches, entering southern Hunan. Tan's Staff Officer, Yang Zong, also returned to Guangxi on the afternoon of the 18th with anti-Japanese banners and large knives presented by all sectors of Guangdong some time ago. The anti-Japanese armies of the three provinces have already departed one after another, and all sectors of Guangdong have been sending a large number of items to the anti-Japanese army in recent days, including hand-woven face towels and vests sent by the Women's Federation, and a large number of towels and other items sent by Municipal No. 65 Elementary School, Guangdong Middle School, and Lingnan Zhenguang schools.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Car Accident on Shanghai-Hangzhou Road On the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway, passing through Jinshanwei along the coast of this county, the original seawall has become a road for cars. At about 1:00 PM on the 24th of this month, a car was passing on the seawall road. To avoid a child, the driver was careless and the car plunged off the embankment, hitting a station wall pillar, causing many villagers nearby to be injured. One person was crushed to death by the car on the spot, and another was seriously injured and died after being taken home. According to the vehicle manifest, all the passengers were senior officials of a certain agency. Together with local gentry, they identified the dead as Chen Yinquan and Wu Dasan, who were from poor families and in a very miserable condition. Each family was given 400 yuan as compensation. The lightly injured were given money for medical treatment, and the matter was thus settled.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Dao Sheng Township Robbery Case Solved</p>
<p>In Ji Jinde and nine other families in Dao Sheng Township, 91st Tu (district), 15th District of this county, and Xue Zhongmu and seven other families in Lu Men Bridge, burglaries and robberies occurred successively last month, resulting in significant losses. To prevent future occurrences, local people such as Ji Tingfang, Zhang Alin, and Zhu Demao organized a temporary defense group, rotating patrols day and night. At about 1:00 AM the previous (25th) night, the group was patrolling when they saw five suspicious awning boats at the Longshejian bank mouth. They immediately boarded the boats and searched, arresting five men, Xiao Xingsheng, Zhang Yufu, Xiao Jincai, Zhang Erwuzi, and Zhang Wanxin. They were taken to the group and interrogated, and they admitted without hesitation to robbing the Ji family and others. Yesterday, they were escorted to the 15th Detachment of the former Zhouzhen Merchant Corps for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Dramatic Escape of a Notorious Thief</h3>
<p>On the 23rd of this month, Dai Shouquan, the detective chief of the Detective Squad of the Public Security Bureau of this county, led detectives Wang Bingsheng and others to the Heren Inn at the Taizi Wharf of the Diaqiao outside the Changmen Gate of Suzhou. They captured four notorious thieves, Wang Heshang, Zhang Achao, Yu Gouda, and Sun Agou, who had robbed the homes of Cheng Axiang in Yangshuyuan, Tiger Pond, 17th District, and Tao Bozhi in Xiupu Town. After being brought to Wuxi, Squad Leader Xue interrogated them strictly, and the criminals confessed to the robberies without denying it. They were ordered to be imprisoned separately in the detention center pending trial and were assigned to guards Zhang Lansheng and Fan Arong for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 AM that night, Sun Agou suddenly escaped, and there was no trace of him. When Squad Leader Xue learned of this, he immediately placed the two guards, Zhang and Fan, under custody and reported to Director Wu of the Public Security Bureau for instructions. Yesterday, the above-mentioned thieves Wang Heshang, Zhang Achao, and Yu Gouda, as well as the two guards Zhang and Fan, were all transferred to the County Government. Clerk Yao opened the court for interrogation. As a result, the thieves were shackled and imprisoned, and the guards were detained awaiting investigation.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county received a secret report stating that the Xie Da Sen Silk Fabric Shop in Beitan secretly imported a large number of enemy goods. Upon receiving the report, the Association's Standing Committee member Wang Jiehui, together with County Party Department officials Qian Disheng and Zhou Songshi, led all the inspectors to the shop and seized approximately 200 pieces of Japanese yarn, cloth, and crepe cloth. They were all taken to the association for sealing. It was decided to convene a temporary committee meeting today to discuss the disposal method.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Industry Association General Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday (26th), at 3:00 PM, the Cocoon Industry Association of this county held a general meeting of all members at the Huangbudun meeting place to discuss matters such as opening scales. Two or three hundred members attended. Chairman Hua Shaochun reported on the original documents from the Yingdang Tax, Stamp Tax, House Donation, and Water Police District, as well as the letter protecting the cocoon market, and then began the discussion. The resolved matters were: (1) The scales will be opened on June 1st. (2) The fresh cocoon prices are: High-grade 35 yuan, second-grade 25 yuan, and inferior-grade not accepted. (3) The business tax will be collected by the Bureau sending a representative to the meeting. (4) The stamp tax will remain the same. (5) All industry members should join the association. (6) Protection matters will still be negotiated by the association to request protection from the water and land military police. After the discussion, the meeting was dismissed. Today, dozens of cocoon houses, such as Nongyi Huiyuan Yuanyuan, reported their opening. The cocoon scales could not be changed in time and will continue to be handled according to the usual regulations.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Xinhua Steamer Robbed by Bandits</p>
<p>Bandit attacks on ships traveling at night in Wu Yi County are frequent. Therefore, the Yixing and Qiting barge companies, to avoid danger, requested the Xinhua Steamer Bureau outside the West Gate to tow them with steamers. This would allow them to arrive at their destination earlier, avoiding unexpected encounters late at night. Unexpectedly, on the 24th, the steamer, as usual, towed the Yizhen and Qitingqiao barges towards Changzhou. However, the machinery suddenly broke down en route, and repairs were carried out along the way, causing delays. Upon reaching the Shantang Street wharf outside the West Gate, it was already around 1 a.m. on the 25th. A public ferry was located in the river there, where many bandits had been waiting. Upon seeing the steamer arrive, they immediately opened fire to rob it. Two sailors, Wu Zhongjin and Jiang Zhengrong, were both shot and injured. As a result, the steamer had to stop. The bandits boarded the steamer and looted at will, with no passenger, male or female, spared. After a long time, they left with a whoop.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Three Bandits Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>Last month, Zhang Jinming, a farmer from Ziting Village in the county's Fourth District, was robbed and injured by bandits. After the case occurred, the county police force arrested eight bandits, including Sun Xiaogou, one after another and brought them to the county for interrogation. Sun Xiaogou, Wangzi, Lao Lu, and others confessed without hesitation, while the other criminals gave cunning and evasive statements. County Magistrate Guo recorded the statements and telegraphed the province for instructions. A telegram was received authorizing the execution of the three criminals. Today, at 8 a.m., Shen Cheng, acting as the judge, ordered the criminals Sun Xiaogou, Wangzi, and Lao Lu to be brought forward by name. After verifying their identities, they were tied up and taken to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>National Representative Preliminary Election Results Announced</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the County Party Headquarters has been handling the preliminary election of the Third National Congress representatives for several days. It has now been completed. The province specially sent Supervisor Pan Guolai to Danyang to supervise the election. Yesterday at 8 a.m., the ballots were tallied. As a result, Zhang Fukang received 42 votes, and Jiang Ziqiao received 41 votes. They were elected as preliminary representatives with the most votes.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Implementation of Special Tax on Gray Bricks</p>
<p>Since the Financial Department appointed Wu Xincheng as the Jiangsu Special Commissioner for the collection of the special tax on lime and tile businesses in Jiangsu Province, the entire province has been divided into eleven districts, with personnel assigned to establish branch offices. The commissioners for each district have already been appointed by the Commissioner's Office. The commissioners include Yang Yushu for the first district, Tang Yongzhong for the second district, Ye Shunyu for the third district, Wang Huixiang for the fourth district, Zhu Diankuan for the fifth district, Zou Yi for the sixth district, Ni Yingxiang for the seventh district, Gu Weiqiao for the eighth district, and Zeng Huiseng for the tenth district. Personnel for the ninth and eleventh districts have not yet been determined. It is reported that the Provincial Chamber of Commerce believes that the merchants of domestic lime, bricks, tiles, and other products are mostly small-scale businesses. Once the tax rate is increased, these national products may frequently go bankrupt. They have submitted separate petitions to the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Department to request tax exemptions to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. However, the Financial Department, due to the difficulty in tax collection, has recently ordered all counties to assist.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Sheng Family Estate Seized Again</p>
<p>The estate of the late Qing Dynasty Sheng Xuanhuai, worth six to seven million, is located in the areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Cheng. It was previously ordered to be seized by the province. Later, the Sheng family obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to revoke the seizure. The Jiangyin magistrate had already followed the order through Statistician Xing Xipei. Yesterday (the 24th), the county government suddenly received another order from the province stating that the Sheng family's estate should be seized again as before. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Ruan ordered Xing Xipei to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>The Difficult Situation of Local Finances</h3>
<p>With the Summer Festival approaching, local finances are in a dire situation. For example, education expenses have been in arrears for seven or eight months, and schools are unable to maintain themselves. The principals of the county-run schools have repeatedly met, deciding that one or two months' worth of salaries must be paid before the Dragon Boat Festival. After the merger of the Finance Bureau, revenue collection is poor, and the funds available are insufficient to cope. County Magistrate Ruan specially hosted a banquet at Yiyuan on the 24th, inviting representatives from various silk firms, salt merchants, and yarn factories to borrow 14,000 yuan to address the emergency. The representatives present all stated that Jiangyin's commerce was in decline and its finances were stagnant, making it difficult to raise funds immediately. They agreed to discuss the matter and respond later.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Forcibly Recovering Confiscated Reclaimed Land</p>
<p>The provincial government determined that the Sixth and Seventh Wei reclaimed land in the Xu Daochun encroachment case was to be confiscated and ordered the Nantong County government to have Xu surrender the land. Xu has been in charge of it for half a year but has not complied. County Magistrate Ye went to the sand area on the 25th with a provincial order to forcibly execute the recovery. Xu Daochun received the news while in custody and suddenly began a hunger strike. It is unknown what will happen next.</p>
<h3>Lüsi's Maritime Defense Strengthened</h3>
<p>The military and police, believing that there is collaboration with traitors in the coastal area of Lüsi, have specially deployed defenses and hired people familiar with the beaches to form a reconnaissance team to assist the military and police in their anti-espionage operations.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Inspection in Bengbu City</p>
<p>Since Wang Kaizhen, the commander of the 37th Regiment of the Third Army's Seventh Division and concurrently the Director of the Bengbu Military and Police Inspection Office, led his troops to garrison the area, he has made considerable efforts in maintaining local security and order. He has repeatedly cracked down on opposing organizations and arrested many traitors. Recently, the Military and Police Inspection Office, considering the importance of local security during this time of national crisis, decided to conduct a joint military and police inspection to prevent spies from hiding in the city. Several meetings were held beforehand regarding the division of regions, deployment of troops, inspection procedures, and timing. The security measures were very strict. Only today (the 24th) at 5 a.m. did the operation begin. The entire city was divided into five districts, with each district assigned a company of soldiers, three patrol officers, and more than ten police officers to inspect door-to-door. Anyone found to be suspicious was immediately taken into custody, and their rooms were searched. The military and police acted cautiously, so the citizens were not alarmed. By about 9 a.m., the entire city had been inspected. A total of thirty-two scattered soldiers and vagrants were apprehended, and several prohibited items were seized. They were all taken to the office for punishment. Among them were several unofficial recruiters, including Zhan Qifeng, who were suspected of falsely recruiting soldiers. Therefore, special attention was paid to them. In the future, appropriate measures will be taken against various recruitment offices. Several opium addicts and suspicious vagrants were apprehended and will be dealt with leniently. In addition, Gao Zhenbai (also known as Gao Chuanjia) was arrested at the Xiyouxi Chang Carpenter Street Zhendan Apartments. Two pistols bullets and several opium smoking paraphernalia were found in his room, and he was taken to the office for interrogation.</p>

Since mid-April, the internal workings of the factory have mostly been organized, and the output has increased sharply, from tens of thousands of yuan per day to 200,000 yuan. Regarding the quality of the new coins produced, this mint is concerned with social economy and international reputation, which is of the utmost importance, and we conduct thorough inspections.

Fortunately, the Review Committee, under the leadership of President Kong, has been declared established. President Kong is an advanced member of the party and the country, and the gentlemen in charge of the entire committee are all famous leaders in the Chinese and foreign monetary circles. From now on, we will gather together and offer many contributions. Smooth progress can be predicted. The mint will receive timely guidance, and I am very happy about this."

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Refutes Rumors of a Business Strike</h3>
<p>Internal Disputes Only Lead to Self-Destruction, Resisting Enemy Goods is the Duty of the Business Community</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, due to rumors circulating about a business strike, issued an emergency notice yesterday to refute the falsehoods. Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the chamber, also gave an important speech to the Xinsheng News Agency, which is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's notice to all members states: "Recently, there have been rumors circulating that the business community is planning a strike. Upon closer examination, these rumors are likely the work of those who seek to divide us. At this critical juncture, the business community knows only to endure hardship and work with all sectors to build a strong foundation. Internal disputes will only lead to self-destruction. There is no one so ignorant of the overall situation as to engage in such behavior. In addition to refuting the rumors, we hereby notify all merchants not to be easily fooled, not to be misled by rumors, and to wholeheartedly dedicate ourselves to the work of resisting enemy goods, which is the duty of the business community and will alleviate the national crisis invisibly. Let us all strive together. Respectfully announced and wishing you well."</p>
<h3>Talk</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a speech to the Xinsheng News Agency, saying, "Recently, there have been rumors that the business community is planning a strike. I really don't know where this rumor came from. Regarding the attitude of the business community during this time of national crisis, we know only to cooperate with the people of the whole country, to endure hardship, and to steadily respond to the situation. As for empty talk, clamoring, and subversive plots, all sectors have suffered enough from such lessons over the years and have thoroughly awakened. There is no one so insane at this time as to dare to instigate such an attempt. These rumors are likely the work of those who seek to divide us, hoping that we will suspect each other, fight among ourselves, and become exhausted day by day. It is not worth a laugh. I hope everyone will not be misled."</p>

<h3>Desperate Attitude</h3>
<p>The displaced overseas Chinese who arrived in Shanghai yesterday including men, women, old, and children was a total of one hundred eighteen people. Their attitudes were all very desperate because the time they were kicked out of Mexico was rushed, and they had no preparations. They could only leave with their personal belongings. Apart from the clothes on their bodies they had nothing else. Some of them have Mexican wives. The wives also returned with their husbands this time. But the clothes that they are wearing are still spring clothes. They have also had to endure the hardships of travel and their appearance is worn out.</p>
<h3>Chinese Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>Continuing to Reduce Work to be Implemented Starting Today</p>
<p>The Workers of the Shenxin and Puyi Factories Are Slowing Down Work to Be Rewarded</p>
<p>The Reasons for Yarn Factories To Tighten Down Is That Foreign Factories Exceed In Proportion</p>
<p>The City's Cotton Storage Is Alarmed, It Is Only Enough for One Month</p>
<p>The Yarn Factories in the city continued to reduce labor. After the 22nd of this month, the stocks of yarn had not decreased in each factory. The woven yarn would inevitably lose money, so they decided to continue to reduce work. At the same time, they would implement austerity measures, cut workers, and cancel the monthly incentive work. This caused the workers of the Shenxin Factory and the Puyi Factory to slow down their work. Also, the city's cotton inventory is lacking, and it is said that it is only enough for one month. Details are recorded below</p>
<h3>Continuing To Reduce Work</h3>
<p>After the decision to continue to reduce work in a total of twenty-eight Chinese yarn factories, they all used Saturday and Sunday day and night shifts to stop, which is a 23% reduction in work. Today, Saturday, is the first day of the continued reduction in work, and all yarn factories are implementing it according to the above method. At the same time, continue to tighten, and each announced the cancellation of the monthly reward of two days or four days of labor for the workers. As for the city's yarn stocks, as of the 15th of this month, the price of 150,000 bales of yarn has increased by ten yuan per bale compared with the lowest price, and the price of cotton has increased by five yuan per bale compared with the lowest price. Every 360 catties of cotton is spun into one bale of yarn, which is in the ratio of three to one. So the woven yarn still has to lose money at the current price</p>
<h3>Reasons For Tightening</h3>
<p>In addition to the continued reduction of work, the Chinese yarn factories also implemented austerity measures. The reason is that the total number of spindles in the Chinese yarn factories in the city is 1,157,200, and the number of workers is 65,146. The total number of spindles in Japanese yarn factories is 1,458,060, and the number of workers is 51,103. The above is the report of the Yarn Industry Association in the spring of the 21st year of the Republic of China. However, Japanese yarn factories implemented austerity measures and laid off a large number of workers in the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China and the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. In this proportion, the number of spindles in Chinese yarn factories is less, but the number of workers is more than in Japanese yarn factories. Therefore, austerity measures are unavoidable</p>
<h3>Lack Of Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton used by the city's yarn factories is produced in Hubei, Henan, Shandong, and other places, as well as American and Indian cotton. The cotton used by Chinese yarn factories is mostly domestic cotton. The city has been alarmed that there is a lack of domestic cotton. The cotton stocks in Shanghai are less than 200,000 dan, and the factory stocks are not abundant. The cotton stocks in the place of origin is not even one tenth. The source of supply in the mainland is therefore lacking. It will be at least three or four months before the new cotton is available. As for the American cotton and Indian cotton stored in the city, it is only 200,000 dan, which is not enough to maintain the needs of the city's 61 Chinese and foreign yarn factories for one month. Therefore, there is an imbalance of supply and demand for cotton in the yarn factories. It is expected that Chinese and foreign yarn merchants are working on a solution.</p>
<h3>British Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>The city's British yarn factories, which include Jardine Matheson Textile Company's Jardine Matheson Yarn Factory at 46 Yangshupu Road, Public Interest Yarn Factory at 150 Roberts Road, and Yangshupu Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road, have a total of 177,228 spindles, 2,480 looms, and more than 13,000 Chinese workers. Due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, stagnant sales, and the accumulation of yarn stocks, they have all announced that they will suspend all night shifts and only operate day shifts. The night shift workers and the day shift workers will switch shifts to work.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>The city's Japanese yarn factories, which include Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd., Japan-China Textile Co., Ltd., Naigai Cotton Co., Ltd., Donghua Textile Co., Ltd., Tongxing Textile Co., Ltd., Gongda Yarn Factory, Dakang Yarn Factory, Yufeng Yarn Factory, and Toyota Yarn Factory, have a total of 1,148,184 spindles, 189,824 thread spindles, 9,846 looms, and 54,606 workers. The amount of yarn they spin every day is very large. Since the stores have been affected by our country's resistance. Goods have accumulated so a liquidation sale has been carried out. The prices have been arbitrarily lowered and the Japanese government has given subsidies so that the Chinese yarn factories have been greatly affected. But at the time of the liquidation sale, the Chinese workers have been suppressed and strictly managed and replaced with Japanese people. The monthly rewards were already canceled last month.</p>
<h3>Puyi Factory One</h3>
<p>After the Puyi Textile Factory One of Yichang Road, released on the 23rd of this month, announced the cancellation of the monthly four-day reward, the workers of the fine yarn division B immediately asked the factory to resume. The vice factory director Xu Zhenbo promised to discuss with the general manager and reply next week. The workers of the fine yarn division A announced a slowdown of work at 12:00 pm on the 25th. The factory immediately reported to the Putuo Road Police Station and sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to guard for protection, and persuaded the workers to no avail. On the morning of the 26th, it was announced that the entire factory was temporarily shut down. The total number of workers is about 1,400. As for the workers of the second factory, they also asked the factory to resume the reward yesterday. Fortunately, no incident occurred. Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau and Li Weixiong from the City Party Department went to investigate together yesterday morning at 10:00 am in order to review.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Factory One</h3>
<p>The Shen Textile Factory One in Zhoujiaqiao, announced the cancellation of the reward and assigned the officials of the party and government organs and members to coordinate. Because the coordination was ineffective the whole factory's nine thousand employees announced a slowdown of work on the afternoon of the day before. Yesterday morning at 10:00 am the workers of the cotton textile labor union of District Ten was worried the situation was gradually turning serious so they sent Zhuang Guanyong to the City Party Department to ask for them to coordinate. The Civil Training Branch worker Lu Yinchu received him and allowed the members of the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate at the same time. He also ordered the union representatives to persuade the workers to resume work that day and to wait for the coordination of the party and the government in peace. They went to the City Government to petition. Section 2 worker Zhang Yiyu received them and he promised to let the Social Affairs Bureau handle it. In the afternoon they went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, the Coordination Branch Chief Wang Xianqing received them and allowed the workers to coordinate. It was heard that the plan to coordinate has been decided. In the next few days The City Government and the General Manager Rong Zongjing will coordinate.</p>
<h3>Visit Mayor Wu</h3>
<p>The displaced overseas Chinese etc were accompanied by The Chinese Overseas General Chamber of Commerce Reception Minister Fang Difei in fifteen cars to the Municipal Government of Fenglin Bridge to petition. After arriving, the seven representatives Huang Zhulin·Li Chuan·Lin Ganlin·Huang Sheng·Huang Min·Zhang Yaonan·Zhang Baiyu· and others visited Mayor Wu, The remaining displaced overseas Chinese all stood guard and waited in front of the municipal government gates. At 4:00 pm Mayor Wu personally received the representatives. He first gave the various representatives warm encouragement. Regarding the points of the petition (see the decision). He allowed to have consultations with the Central Committee. He also sincerely expressed he would do his best to help out with the requests of the displaced overseas Chinese, giving full assistance. He asked the representatives to remain at the Chinese Overseas General Chamber of Commerce and peacefully await for the governments methods. The various representatives acknowledged that it was satisfying and they immediately left.</p>
<h3>Foreign Affairs Office Petitions</h3>
<p>The various displaced overseas Chinese had delegates Tan Rongxing, Lin Wenli, Lin Huiyao and the other five taken out by the Chinese Overseas General Chamber of Commerce Secretary-General Peng CanGuang to the Foreign Affairs Office to petition. The Section Chief Zhao TieZhang received them. The various delegates reported on the recent situation in Mexico excluding the Chinese and requested the Department of Foreign Affairs to have serious negotiations with Mexico urgently. Section Chief Zhao first represented the Foreign Affairs Office in expressing comfort. Regarding the requests of the displaced overseas Chinese, he allowed that he would telegraph the Department of Foreign Affairs. The various delegates acknowledged that it was satisfying.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Office Petitions</h3>
<p>After the various displaced overseas Chinese exited the city and after a period of time travelled to the Guangzhou Public Office of Ningbo Road to petition. The Civil Affairs Office Board Director Zheng Zhang refused in harsh words and the assembly hall was closed. After the representative Peng CanGuang of the Chinese Overseas General Chamber of Commerce intervened the displaced overseas Chinese were allowed to enter and be seated and Wen Zongyao received them. The various delegates of the displaced overseas Chinese requested financial assistance to help. Wen stated that this could not be accepted. Wen said that he would bring the financial assistance back to Hong Kong and would assist together with the Tung Wah Hospital for their own use. The various displaced overseas Chinese said that in the past Wen had agreed that he would distribute many tens of thousands of Yuan of financial assistance to them, why would he go back on it like this. At that time each of the displaced overseas Chinese was extremely angry, and unanimously stated that if there was any assistance in Hong Kong they would uniformly refuse it and left.</p>
<h3>Coming to Guangdong this morning</h3>
<p>The various displaced overseas Chinese returning to the country are from Guangdong Zhuhai Xinhui and Nanhai County. Apart from the six representatives Chen Bang, Zhang Yaonan, Huang Sheng, Huang Huang, Lin Ganlin, Zhang Baiyu and others remaining in Shanghai, the remainder were scheduled to board the original ship, heading to Guangdong to return.</p>

<h3>Factory Inspection Issues in the Concession</h3>
<p>Preliminary Discussions Yesterday</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun and Feixindun's Opinions Are Similar, Further Talks Will Be Held in Four or Five Days</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Secretary General Yu Hongjun and the Chief Executive of the Public Concession, Feixindun, agreed to have preliminary discussions yesterday afternoon on the transfer of factory inspection rights in the Public Concession, seeking a satisfactory solution. The talks went very smoothly. It has now been decided that follow-up talks will be held next Tuesday and Wednesday. The details of yesterday's talks are as follows:</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 3:10 PM, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun went to the Public Works Department to meet with Director-General Fessenden. The two immediately began discussions, which lasted about half an hour. Mr. Yu then left. The opinions of both sides were very close. It is heard that the Public Works Department has a good understanding of our principle of safeguarding sovereignty. Therefore, yesterday's initial talks went very smoothly.</p>
<h3>Principles of the Talk</h3>
<p>The principle of yesterday's talks was based on our proposition. This proposition is the result of Mayor Wu's recent visit to Nanjing to discuss with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Yesterday, Secretary-General Yu explained this principle in detail to Director-General Fessenden of the Public Works Department for preliminary consultation. However, the detailed methods of how to resolve it in the future will be studied separately by both parties and discussed at the next consultation.</p>
<h3>Date of Continued Negotiation</h3>
<p>Although the opinions of both parties were close and the progress was smooth in yesterday's consultation, detailed methods still need to be studied separately. Therefore, there was no concrete decision. Currently, Mr. Yu and Mr. Fessenden have agreed to consult again next Tuesday or Wednesday. As for the written opinions expressed by Mr. Fessenden a few days ago, they have not yet been submitted to the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Talk by the Counselor of the Russian Embassy</h3>
<p>Sino-Russian Diplomacy</p>
<p>Negotiations on the Sino-Russian Commercial Treaty and Eastern Railway Dispute Are Not Yet Open in Moscow; Recovery of Consulate Affairs in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Humanitarian Aid to Russian Nationals Are Baseless.</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Soviet Russian Ambassador to China Bogomolov came to Shanghai from Nanjing to prepare for the restoration of the consulate in Shanghai. Mr. Eshan Yin, Chinese Counselor of the embassy, also came to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter made a special visit to interview him and discussed the issues of the Russian consulate and Sino-Russian diplomacy. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Recent Sino-Russian Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The reporter asked Counselor Eshan about the Sino-Russian trade, the Eastern Railway incident, and the Sino-Russian commercial treaty. According to Mr. Eshan, regarding the Eastern Railway incident, the intention of the Chinese National Government is to have Ambassador Yan in Russia negotiate with the Soviet diplomatic authorities in Moscow. Therefore, the Russian Embassy in China has no say in this matter. As for the Sino-Russian commercial treaty, it could have been started recently. However, due to the ambassador's recent arrival in China and the fact that internal matters such as the embassy and consulates have not yet been properly arranged, there was no time for negotiation. However, there was an informal contact once after the presentation of credentials.</p>
<h3>Matters Concerning the Restoration of Consulates</h3>
<p>As for the ambassador's visit to Shanghai, it is for consular affairs. His return to Nanjing should be in one or two weeks. The local consulate will begin renovations within a few days, which will be completed in about a month. After the renovation is completed, it will begin to operate and restore the consulate in Shanghai. Currently, Counselor Balikov has been ordered to concurrently serve as the Consul-General in Tianjin and plans to restore the old consulate in Tianjin. Although two houses have been found for the embassy in Nanjing, it is still unknown whether they will be sufficient.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Russian Nationals Is Not Accurate</h3>
<p>Subsequently, the reporter asked whether the report that an investigation of Russian nationals was being conducted was true. According to Mr. Eshan, the total number of Soviet Russian nationals residing in Shanghai is only about two hundred. There are detailed records of each person, so there is no need for an investigation. Moreover, those Soviet Russian nationals who come to China have legitimate occupations or are sent to China by the government. There is no unemployment and no need for relief. As for other Russians in Shanghai, although there are many, they have all lost their nationality. The Soviet Russian Ambassador to China has no right to investigate these people who have lost their nationality. Therefore, the rumors that the ambassador came to Shanghai to investigate nationals and provide relief for the unemployed are not true.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Purchases Warplanes</h3>
<p>Ordered Eighteen Aircraft, One of Which Has Arrived</p>
<p>According to the Dalu Daily News, American aviator Doolittle has completed his mission in China and will leave Shanghai within a week to resume his tour of the world by flying back to the United States via KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. It is said that during his trip to Guangdong, he sold eighteen Curtiss Hawk fighter planes to the Guangdong government. Except for one that has already been delivered, the first batch of five will be loaded on the President Coolidge and should arrive in Shanghai around the ninth of next month. The planes are equipped with a 700-horsepower Blue Eagle rotary engine with a maximum flight speed of 208 miles per hour and an absolute altitude of 31,500 feet. Each side of the fuselage is equipped with a machine gun driven by the engine. There are two synchronizers with automatic control, so that bullets can be fired through the propeller blades. The gun barrel is parallel to the engine, and the bullet belt is installed in a sliding drawer and can be loaded from the plane. In addition, each of the lower wings is equipped with a set of American Army-used A-3 bomb racks. After these planes are transported to Guangdong, the installation work will be supervised by Mr. Ferris, a factory mechanic from the Curtiss Blue Eagle Export Company, who came to Shanghai in April.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Borrows Five Million from Banks</h3>
<p>To Fund Anti-Japanese and Bandit Suppression Expenses</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, because the anti-Japanese military affairs in North China have not yet yielded immediate results, and the work of suppressing the communists in Jiangxi is in a state of extreme tension, the national treasury is strained and military expenditures are insufficient. Therefore, recently, Deputy Minister of Finance Zou Lin negotiated with the banking community in Shanghai for a short-term loan of five million yuan, designating a certain income as collateral. The use of this loan is to provide military expenses for anti-Japanese and communist suppression. According to the Xinxin News Agency reporter's investigation with the banking community in Shanghai yesterday, this loan will be shared by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks. It has now been paid. The banking community also stated that recently, due to the shortage of central government revenue, the current anti-Japanese and communist suppression military expenses are very large. The monthly need for the anti-Japanese war in North China is eight million yuan, and the monthly need for the communist suppression in Jiangxi is five million yuan. With such huge expenditures, it often feels strained. Therefore, they often negotiate loans with the banking community. This type of loan has not been done only once. Because the government can repay it according to the scheduled time, the banking community is also happy to provide assistance.</p>

<h3>"Ningbo" Aircraft Has Been Ordered</h3>
<p>One New Fighter Jet Will Be Shipped to Shanghai in Early July</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association Aviation Patriotic Fundraising Committee has raised more than 96,000 yuan since its inception. The captains of the association, in view of the country's dire situation and in order to implement practical strength, have ordered a state-of-the-art fighter aircraft from Vickers-Armstrongs of England. It can fly 240 miles per hour at an altitude of over 30,000 feet, and its fuselage is agile and flies freely. In particular, it can launch grenades or any bombing ordnance on the fly. There is also a complete set of four anti-aircraft guns that can shoot accurately to a vertical altitude of 30,000 feet at a rate of 450 rounds per minute. In addition, it includes a new type of predictor, which is fully electric and has a built-in telephone. Based on mathematical algorithms, it accurately determines the angle between the observer and the future target. The indicator has three parts: a 90-degree elevation gun, a future angle calculator, and a fuse applicator, which can directly fire the guns. It is truly a military weapon. In summary, the value is quite large. The association is still short of funds and has specially asked the captains to actively raise funds to achieve the goal and complete the project as soon as possible. It is also heard that the machine is scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai in early July.</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation to Test Fly Chongqing-Chengdu Route Tomorrow</p>
<p>The "Bengbu" aircraft will take off from Chongqing, officially opening the route on June 8</p>
<h3>Chongqing-Chengdu Provisionally Designated as an Aviation Zone</h3>
<p>The terminus of the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Sichuan route was originally Chengdu.</p>
<p>However, due to political relations in Sichuan Province, it has only been able to fly to Chongqing for the past three years. Since the arrival of the company's general manager, Mr. Dai Enji, he believes that whether it is to develop the company's business or to facilitate transportation in Sichuan Province, the Chongqing-Chengdu section should overcome difficulties and open to traffic as soon as possible. Therefore, the company's business manager, Mr. Huang Bao Xian, was sent to Chongqing to negotiate a month ago. The result was very satisfactory. After Mr. Huang returned to Shanghai, he actively prepared for the opening of traffic. It has now been decided that the "Bengbu" aircraft, piloted by American pilot Anlixun, will test fly from Chongqing to Chengdu tomorrow (the 28th) (because it is a test flight, it will not take off from Shanghai). It has also been decided to officially open traffic on June 8. The Chongqing-Chengdu section is provisionally designated as an aviation zone. In the future, every Tuesday and Friday, the flight from Shanghai to Chengdu, and every Thursday and Sunday, the flight from Chengdu to Shanghai, will take two days each with Hankou as the central point. If the business of the Chongqing-Chengdu section develops, it will fly once a day. The one-way fare is 120 yuan, and the round-trip fare is 210 yuan. The business of transporting and selling aviation newspapers will still be handled by the Shanghai Aviation News Agency at 314 Shandong Road, Shanghai. The agency can transport all major Chinese and Western newspapers in Shanghai to Chengdu by about 5 p.m. the next day, and forward them by express mail to various places in Sichuan and Xikang, arriving more than a month earlier than ordinary mail. It is heard that in order to promote culture and transmit news, the agency sells major Chinese newspapers for only 11 yuan or 9 yuan per month, English newspapers for 25 yuan, and French and German newspapers for 12 yuan each. Many people in Shanghai have ordered newspapers from the agency to send to relatives and friends in Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Japanese Merchants Hold Meetings for Days</h3>
<p>To Study Tariff Countermeasures</p>
<p>They Admit They Want to Oppose but Have No Legal Basis; They Want to Make Trouble and Use Force to Intimidate</p>
<p>According to the Hualian News Agency in Shanghai, Japanese merchants in Shanghai are very dissatisfied with our new tariff law, especially cotton yarn and cloth merchants, who falsely accuse it of being a disguised way to boycott Japanese goods. They have been holding meetings for days to study countermeasures. The Cotton Cloth Industry Association held a committee meeting at the Japanese Club in Hongkou at 6 p.m. yesterday and sent telegrams to the Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exporters Association and the Osaka Cotton Cloth Merchants Alliance, asking for their help. After discussion yesterday, the committee members said that since China has tariff sovereignty, there is no legal basis for resistance. However, they only ask the Chinese government to reflect on it out of friendship. In fact, our country's tariffs are far less harsh than Japan's. The Japanese are still not satisfied and want to make things difficult for our government. They have drafted eight proposals and submitted them to the Shanghai Consulate General, the Shanghai Business Affairs Office, and the Chamber of Commerce, the contents of which are excerpted as follows: (1) Although the new tariff rates are equal to all countries, the most important import goods from Japan, which are the most numerous, are subject to the highest tax rates. (2) It is unreasonable to treat high-end goods from the United Kingdom and inferior goods from Japan equally. (3) Although China says that the purpose is to promote domestic production and increase fiscal revenue, it is actually clearly aimed at boycotting Japanese goods. (4) If these tariff rates are not revised, not only will cotton yarn merchants be hit, but also Japanese commercial and industrial businesses in China will be affected. As a result, Japan's trade with China will decline from now on. (5) This problem is more serious than last year's Shanghai incident. If it is not resolved properly, terrible incidents may occur. (6) The ceasefire in North China will be established, but due to the tariff issue, the prospects for peace may turn bleak. (7) The government must understand the firm determination of the industry and resolve this issue. (8) The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce should telegraph the International Chamber of Commerce to seek assistance and find a satisfactory solution, and ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide similar assistance.</p>
<p>The Japanese, who are accustomed to doing business with guns, clearly know that protests have no legal basis, but they want to use force to intimidate and seek improper benefits. If Japanese merchants study the tariffs levied on Chinese goods in Japan, they will understand that the behavior of Japanese merchants is nonsensical. Japanese merchants have not done this. Today, they will convene representatives of various Japanese business associations in Shanghai to hold a meeting to expand their meaningless movement.</p>
<h3>Lu Xuepu Denies Transfer to Fujian</h3>
<p>It Is Said That It Was Actually a Mistake About Lu Wenlan</p>
<p>According to a Nanjing telegram, there are rumors that Lu Xuepu, the director of the Central Mint, will be transferred to Fujian as the supervisor of the Fujian Customs. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with Mr. Lu at the Central Mint yesterday. According to him, this rumor is completely unfounded and is actually a mistake about Lu Wenlan.</p>
<p>Northeast Refugee Association Telegraphed Tianjin Office to Actively Distribute Relief Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees telegraphed its Tianjin office yesterday to inquire about the disaster situation. The details of the exchange are as follows: (Tianjin Telegram) We have received your telegram with respect. We have learned from the newspaper that the Charity Association is organized by local organizations.

<h3>The Crisis of Ramie Cloth Sales in Korea</h3>
<p>Talk by Ji Zejin of the Guidance Department of the Trade Bureau</p>
<p>In addition to silk and tea, ramie cloth is also a special product of our country.</p>
<p>The annual export volume is very large, and most of it is sold in the Korean market. Koreans use ramie cloth as the main raw material for clothing throughout the year. According to the export statistics of our customs, in 1931, the total export value of fine ramie cloth was Customs Silver 4,219,828 taels, of which 4,083,260 taels were transported to Korea, accounting for more than 95% of the total. However, since the abolition of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, Japan is expected to be greatly affected. Due to the low Japanese exchange rate, the abolition of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement may not have a significant impact on Sino-Japanese trade. On the other hand, in terms of our country's trade with Japan, as far as Korea is concerned, the ramie cloth that has been sold in Korea has almost reached a state of decline. Currently, the import tax rate on our ramie cloth in Korea is 25% ad valorem, but due to the Japanese customs officials' abuse of valuation, the tax levied is actually more than that. The Korean authorities plan to increase the tax rate on our ramie cloth to 30-40%. The purpose is both to retaliate and to encourage domestic production. Moreover, the ramie producing areas in Korea are Jeolla Nam-do, Jeolla Buk-do, and Chungcheong Nam-do, with a cultivated area of 1,569 cho (1 cho is equivalent to 1.667 acres in our country), and an annual production value of 340,000 yuan. In addition, the main hemp producing areas are Pyeongan Buk-do and Gangwon-do, followed by Gyeonggi-do and Gyeongsang Nam-do, but the output is not large. The total production value in Korea reaches 5,380,000 yuan annually. Starting this year, the Governor-General of Korea is taking the opportunity of the upcoming abolition of the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement to implement the "Flax Cultivation Plan" to develop the hemp production industry in order to drive out our ramie cloth in the Korean market. However, judging from the above-mentioned ramie production situation in Korea, it is still questionable whether it can be self-sufficient. The quality of Korean ramie is inferior, so the ramie cloth produced is coarse and easy to break, far inferior to the durability of our ramie cloth. However, the Korean people are economically weak and only care about immediate benefits, without considering the long-term. They often purchase cheap Korean ramie cloth to make clothes, which makes it impossible for our more expensive ramie cloth to be widely sold. From now on, if the Korean authorities increase the tax rate on our ramie cloth again, I am afraid that our ramie cloth will not be able to gain a foothold in the Korean market.</p>
<h3>Registered Books</h3>
<p>The Post Office Will Increase Postage</p>
<p>The Directorate General and the Postal Department are Drafting Measures; Parcel Post to Various Areas of Luanzhou Will Be Suspended</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson from the Mail Management Department of the Postal Administration yesterday, the Bureau still accepts mail for Qinhuangdao and Luanzhou-affiliated regions; however, delivery is very difficult. As such, the Tianjin Bureau has been returning many undeliverable letters to Shanghai. The reason for this is because</p>
<h3>War Conditions</h3>
<p>most of the recipients have sought refuge in other regions. Therefore, this office will temporarily suspend the acceptance of heavy postal items such as packages. The notice of this suspension will be issued in the coming days. However, this is only a temporary measure. When the situation in that area improves, normal delivery will resume. According to a spokesperson from the Directorate General,</p>
<h3>Postal Economics</h3>

<h3>Swire Shipping Company</h3>
<p>General Manager Dies in London; Company Observes Mourning Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>John Swire, the General Manager of Swire Shipping Company, worked in the London headquarters, managing shipping operations in Hong Kong, China, and Japan. Mr. Swire passed away in London on the 25th of this month. When the tragic news arrived, all branches mourned together. The situation is described in detail as follows:</p>
<h3>Half-Mast Flag</h3>
<p>Swire was the first British shipping company to operate on Chinese routes. At the beginning of the operation, China Navigation Co. entrusted John Swire as general manager. After decades of hard work, it has expanded to 16 coastal and ocean routes, six routes up and down the Yangtze River, and has gradually increased its branches and managers to 32 locations. It has a total of 64 ships with 159,000 tons. The company ranks first in the shipping industry in China, regardless of Chinese or foreign countries. Yesterday, the Shanghai office received a telegram from London that Swire passed away in London on the 25th. The company, in memory of his pioneering achievements, immediately telegraphed all branches to fly the flag at half-mast for three days to express condolences.</p>
<h3>Color Change</h3>
<p>After the news of Swire's death reached Shanghai, the Shanghai headquarters further discussed the mourning and commemoration methods on the water. Yesterday, it ordered the 64 ships sailing on various routes in the rivers and seas to remove the black paint trim around the hull and repaint it blue to show memorial intent. Starting yesterday, the company's ships have already complied with the order to repaint.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Wusong Reconstruction Project</h3>
<p>Public Works Bureau Announces Demolition Measures</p>
<p>The post-war reconstruction project in the Wusong district is actively underway. However, there are still many houses obstructing the road within the construction site that have not been demolished. In order to facilitate the work, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has specially drafted four measures and submitted them to the municipal government for promulgation. The four measures are recorded as follows: (1) Any houses within the road line that were built without permission after the road line was announced, or whose buildings are temporary in nature, will be ordered to be demolished. (2) Houses that have been destroyed by fire and still have crumbling walls and ruins should be demolished according to the road boundary. (3) Any empty land within the roadside walls and bamboo fences should be persuaded to demolish along the road line, so as to complete the straightening uniformly and achieve a permanent solution. (4) The compensation method for land acquired for road construction will be based on the city's road construction fee regulations.</p>
<h3>Pudong Fellow Townsman</h3>
<p>Store Clerk Donates 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhou Changsheng Sponsors the Construction Association</p>
<p>The Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association has raised funds to purchase land and build an association hall. Two announcements have been made previously. All recognized and paid members have contributed a total of 206,700 yuan, which is only about half of the assumed quota. According to the report submitted by the 43rd team yesterday, there is a fellow townsman named Zhou Changsheng who works as a store clerk at the Shanghai Jianghai Customs. He is a low-level employee with a very low monthly salary and his family is not well-off. He actually donated 100 yuan and earnestly solicited donations from ordinary strong fellow townsmen, saying that he is willing to save on food and clothing to complete this great construction and is unwilling to lag behind capitalists and intellectuals. His fundraising results are also quite impressive. The people of Pudong emphasize practice and do not value empty words. A person like Zhou Changsheng can also be praised.</p>

<h3>For the Benefit of Fellow Villagers Association</h3>
<p>An Appeal Regarding the Tragic Death of Lu Yuanquan</p>
<p>The Jiading Sojourners Association in Shanghai, located at Zhenping Lane, K'ai-tzŭ Erh Road, in this city, regarding the case of their fellow villager Lu Yuanquan being shot to death by Italian soldiers without cause, besides dispatching personnel to offer condolences to Lu Yuanquan's family, had previously sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association, requesting them to forward it to the Italian military authorities for a reasoned negotiation, aiming to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrator and providing compensation. This was already reported in previous newspapers. Now, it is further learned that the association yesterday sent Standing Committee members Chen Dazai, Xu Boliang, Zhang Tianbai, and Weng Guoxun, among others, to the municipal government with a petition, which is recorded below: The petition is regarding fellow villager Lu Yuanquan being innocently shot to death by soldiers of the Italian Marine Corps, requesting a reasoned negotiation to punish the perpetrator and provide compensation. According to Lu Caiye, a fellow villager, who came to the association, his son Lu Yuanquan has been making a living planting flowers and trees. He rented Flower Nursery No. 2, West Sports Road, near the shooting range at the end of North Sichuan Road, working hard to support himself. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, around 10 o'clock, Lu Yuanquan was inspecting the flowers and trees he had planted in the nursery when suddenly a bullet flew over, entering his forehead and exiting the back of his head, killing him instantly. Subsequently, the workers in the nursery reported it to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, and the next day's newspaper reported that it was caused by soldiers of the Italian Marine Corps practicing shooting, resulting in accidental manslaughter. Lu Yuanquan's family is impoverished, with elderly parents over seventy years old above him and young daughters and sons, only six years old, below him. Having suffered this sudden tragic death, the family of many members is now without support. The situation is truly pitiable. Our association is an organization to assist fellow villagers. Faced with this misfortune of a fellow villager, we cannot remain silent. After investigation, the flower nursery is not located in the area designated for shooting targets. The bullets flying around caused harm to law-abiding farmers. The person who fired the shot should absolutely bear the responsibility and should be punished accordingly. As for the family members who suddenly lost their means of livelihood, the widow and orphans have no means of support and should be compensated generously. Therefore, we specially present this petition to Your Excellency, requesting a prompt and reasoned negotiation to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrator and providing compensation. We are eternally grateful. Respectfully presented to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai, by the Jiading Sojourners Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shen Qiulin Robbed on the Road</h3>
<p>Shen Qiulin of this newspaper was robbed at around 9 PM on the evening of the 25th. At the intersection of Maidian Road and the vegetable market street, west of the Big Bell in the French Concession, several robbers suddenly emerged from a nearby lane and surrounded him, searching his body. They robbed him of seventeen silver dollars. Not satisfied, the robbers tried to snatch the gold ring he was wearing on his finger. Shen immediately called for help, and the robbers fled. Shen did not report to the police station because he had important matters to attend to. He hopes that those passing by the area in the future will pay attention to avoid repeating his misfortune.</p>
<h3>The Already Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Sun Jinping's Sentence Commuted to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Sun Jinping, a kidnapper from Tongzhou, thirty-four years old, was involved in kidnapping Wu Nanfu, a wealthy merchant, with accomplices Chen Wenbin and Zhang Afu, on January 7th last year, demanding a ransom of 400,000 gold coins. The case was uncovered and Sun was arrested by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and Inspector Liu Shaokui of the General Inspectorate. After repeated investigations and interrogations by the First Special District Court, he was sentenced to death. The defendant Sun Jinping appealed the sentence to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, but the result was the same. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, because the case occurred during a general amnesty, sent the case back for retrial. The General Inspectorate then sent Sun back to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the Inspectorate, stated that the revised regulations for punishing kidnappers had been abolished, and the prosecution was now based on Article 1 of the Regulations for Punishing Bandits, which also carried the death penalty. However, since the promulgation of the general amnesty decree on March 5th last year, his crime should be reduced. After questioning the defendant in court, the court ordered him to be remanded in custody for sentencing at a later date. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiexun took the bench and announced the verdict, commuting Sun Jinping's sentence to life imprisonment and depriving him of his civil rights for life.</p>

<h3>American Aviator</h3>
<p>Lectures on Civil Aviation</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation hosted a reception for reporters from various newspapers and news agencies at the tea dance hall of the Astor House Hotel on the Bund yesterday at 5 PM, and invited the famous American aviator Mr. Doolittle to give a lecture on "Civil Aviation". Over a dozen people attended, including Mr. Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association, and reporters from various newspapers. First, Mr. Huang Baoxian, Director of the Business Group of the company, gave an introduction, briefly stating that it was a great honor to have Mr. Doolittle and everyone present today. Mr. Doolittle is a world-renowned aviator, as everyone knows. It is unnecessary to introduce him. Your ability to meet with Mr. Doolittle should also be a source of great pleasure. Mr. Doolittle will be giving a lecture on "Civil Aviation", and will undoubtedly offer us insightful and instructive comments. Mr. Doolittle then gave his lecture, briefly stating that he was not eloquent and was afraid that he would not express himself clearly, and hoped that everyone would forgive him. Speaking of the development of civil aviation, it is an important undertaking for the world today, and especially for China. China has a vast territory and a dense population, and transportation is inconvenient. Therefore, without the use of airplanes, it is impossible to govern this vast area and dense population, and to communicate the cultures of various places and people. The United States currently has 18,000 miles of air routes, benefiting half of the entire nation. China currently has three major air routes, all departing from Shanghai to Beiping, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. The latter will be launched on July 1st. These three lines will benefit almost two-thirds of the entire nation, because the majority of the Chinese people gather in this fertile area of southeastern China. In the future, if Shanghai is the aviation hub, connecting British national air routes from Hong Kong, one can directly reach Europe. Connecting American aviation, one can cross the Pacific Ocean and reach San Francisco. Previously, traveling from Shanghai to Hankou by boat took four days. Now, by plane, it only takes four hours. In the future, travel between China and the United States will only take four days. From the standpoint of travel time, travel between China and the United States in the future will be as convenient and fast as travel between Shanghai and Hankou in the past. With the communication between the two countries, the opinions of the two nations will become more beautiful and good. The important elements for the development of American civil aviation are: (1) private companies can cooperate, (2) people pay great attention to aviation, and (3) the government can assist private individuals. Therefore, if the Chinese government can provide the people with considerable assistance in development, rapid results can be seen. What is especially needed is the construction of air stations. The American government has electric light markers every ten miles along the air routes, so that night flights are unobstructed. If China takes Shanghai as a model aviation center, the municipal government must also build these electric light markers to indicate the route. After the lecture, Mr. Doolittle answered reporters' questions: (1) Air routes should be opened between prosperous cities to assist other transportation industries, such as ships and trains, and not to replace the latter. Each province has its strengths. (2) If the Chinese government wants to develop vast areas, aviation will provide major assistance. (3) Those who practice flying must be calm, quick, and hardworking. The intelligence and perseverance of the Chinese people can be developed. (4) The training of aviation talents requires five years of education and practice. After graduating, they must continue to practice in teams. I firmly believe that China will soon be able to train many aviation talents. (5) Promoting the air force in China will certainly cultivate talents. The Hangzhou Aviation School is well-organized and well-guided, and is the foundation for the development of China's air force. At about 6 o'clock, the guests and hosts dispersed in great joy. According to the New News Agency, the Shanghai No. 1 aircraft of the Chinese Aviation Association has decided to hold a naming ceremony at the Longhua Airport on June 1st, and invites people from all walks of life to visit. It is learned that Mayor Wu Tiecheng will invite the American aviator Mr. Doolittle, who is staying in Shanghai, to the field to perform aerial tactics, in order to arouse public interest in saving the country through aviation.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Red Pill Manufacturing Operation Uncovered on Rue Tenant de la Tour</h3>
<p>Mastermind Hu Azhang Arrested in the French Concession; Manufacturing Equipment and Red Pill Ingredients Found</p>
<p>A large-scale red pill manufacturing operation was set up at No. 16, Lane Tenant de la Tour, near Tenant de la Tour Road, Zhabei. It operated secretly day and night, and its output was among the highest of all manufacturing sites. After the red pills were made, they were transported into the concessions for sale by salesmen hired by the operation. At 11 AM the day before yesterday, the operation sent Yao A'gen with two large packages of red pills to sell at a certain location. While passing the intersection of Sichuan Road and Avenue Edward VII, he was discovered by assistant Pang Ruiqing of the General Inspectorate, who reported it to Constable No. 2732, who jointly arrested Yao. The red pills hidden on his body were seized, and he was taken to the police station. Under questioning, it was learned that the mastermind behind the manufacturing operation was</p>

<p>--Proving Hongsheng Was Born to Gu Er's Wife--</p>
<p>In September of the year before last, the Jing'an Temple police uncovered an abduction case and rescued a boy named Hongsheng, aged four or five. Ma Daxing, a Suzhou native residing at No. 743, Renji Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, identified the child as his biological son. The First Special District Court then issued an order allowing Ma Daxing to take the child home. However, Gu Er, a native of Wu County, and his wife Gu Kan, jointly claimed at the police station and the court that the child was actually their son, who had been abducted in June of that year on Huanghe Road in the French Concession. At that time, the First Special Court ruled that the abductor Xia Qiaolin had already been sentenced to five years' imprisonment, and that the reported abduction site was not within the jurisdiction of the court. They were instructed to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court. Subsequently, Gu complied and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, but the Second Special Court stated that the first defendant Xia Qiaolin had already been sentenced, and the second defendant Ma Daxing's residence was in the Public Concession, which was also beyond the jurisdiction of the court. Last year, Gu hired lawyer Chen Wen again and filed a criminal self-accusation against Ma Daxing with the First Special Court, requesting that the defendant be punished with the appropriate crime according to Article 257, Item 1 of the Criminal Code, and that the defendant be ordered to compensate for the loss of 400 dollars and allow the return of his biological son Hongsheng. Judge Qian Wenji was assigned to handle the case. Judge Qian held several court sessions, because both parties claimed that</p>
<p>Hongsheng Was Their Own Biological Child, So He Ordered Both Couples and Hongsheng to Go to the Zhenru Forensic Examination Institute for Examination According to Law. The Blood Clan Was Examined by the Doctors of the Institute. Unexpectedly, the Results Showed That the Blood of Gu Er's Wife and Ma Daxing's Wife Were All the Same as Hongsheng's Blood, While Ma Daxing's Blood Could Not Be Mixed. However, Gu Er Stated That This Child Was Born to His Wife and Her Former Husband, So He Could Not Participate, Making It Difficult to Prove Whose Son Hongsheng Actually Was. Therefore, the Method of Taking Photos and Comparing Each Part Was Adopted. Photos of Each Person's Facial Features and Limbs Were Taken One by One, and After Detailed Comparison, It Was Felt That Hongsheng Was Quite Similar to Gu's Wife, So He Reported the Truth to the Special Court. Yesterday Afternoon, Judge Qian Held a Continued Hearing and Final Conclusion, Determining That Hongsheng Was the Plaintiff's Son, and Pronounced in Court That the Defendant's Crime of Abduction Was Punished with Three Months' Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years. Hongsheng Was Taken Away by the Plaintiff. Ma Daxing Also Gave the Plaintiff 100 Dollars in Compensation for the Loss. However, Ma Heard the Judgment and Stated That He Would Appeal, While Ma's Wife Cried Loudly When She Saw Hongsheng Being Taken Away by Gu Er. Judge Qian Then Described the Reasons for the Judgment in Detail, and Handed Over the Various Points of the Forensic Examination and the Differences in the Photos Taken to the Lawyers on Both Sides for Review.</p>

<h3>Unknowing Fifteen-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<h3>Seduced and Violently Abused by a Lecherous Scoundrel</h3>
<p>Kan Jisheng's Five-Year Sentence is Not Enough to Expiate His Guilt</p>
<p>Parents Should Pay Attention to Social Evils</p>
<p>Xue Youchen, a native of Changshu residing at No. 499, Datong Road, has a daughter named Caiyue, who is fifteen years old. She has a beautiful face. Because her cousin Wang Jinrong runs a shoe store nearby, Xue often goes there to play. However, there is a shoe clerk named Kan Jisheng in Wang's store. He is from Changzhou and is already twenty-four years old. He is still a widower. Seeing that Xue is old enough to be married and has a good appearance, he has been thinking about taking advantage of her, but has no chance. Until this year, Kan's job was suddenly terminated, but</p>
<h3>He Could Not Forget Her</h3>
<p>So He Often Lingered Near the Store, Hoping to Get a Chance to See Xue. On the Morning of the Sixteenth of This Month at About 8 AM, Xue Caiyue Brought a Copper Kettle to Boil Water, and Suddenly Met Kan. Kan Was Overjoyed to See Her Again After a Long Separation. He Hastily Stepped Forward to Talk to Her Secretly, and Told Xue to Bring Her Belongings and Run Away With Him. Xue Was Young and Ignorant, and Fell Into His Trap. She Actually Agreed at the Time, So They Agreed to Meet at the Intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Datong Road at 6 PM That Afternoon. After Saying Goodbye, Xue Went Home and Secretly Stole Three Gold Rings, Two Silver Chains, and Clothes, Etc.,</p>
<h3>Worth a Hundred Dollars</h3>
<p>She Hid it From Her Parents and Took the Things Away. At the Appointed Place, She Met Kan, and They Hired a Rickshaw.</p>
<p>They Actually Went to the Jinbu Hotel at No. 9, Macgregor Road, to Rent a Room to Enjoy Themselves and Realize Their Dream. Xue's Chastity Was Violated. The Next Day, They Moved to Room 4 of the Hengtong Hotel on Hengtong Road, Zhabei. That Night, Xue Was Again Violently Abused and Ravaged Twice by Kan. However, Xue's Father, Youchen, Saw That His Daughter Did Not Return Home One Night and Suspected That She Was Missing. The Next Day, He Went to the Xinzha Police Station to Report and Asked Them to Investigate. He Also Said That Shan Xiansheng Was Suspected. The Police Chief Sent Detective Yang Yunfeng to Investigate.</p>
<h3>First, Shan Was Arrested</h3>
<p>Under Questioning, It Was Only Known That Xue Was in the Jinbu Hotel, But Shan Had Nothing to Do With This Matter, So He Was Released. On One Side, He Went to Jinbu to Investigate. According to Reports, Xue and Kan Did Come and Stayed One Night, But They Had Moved to the Hengtong Hotel. Detective Yang Also Went to Hengtong to Investigate, But Xue and Others Had Already Left. Kan Was Well-Informed. After Shan Was Arrested, Kan Knew That Things Had Been Exposed, So on the Nineteenth, He Took Xue to a Friend's Place at Hujiamuqiao to Stay Temporarily. He Then Obtained Gold, Silver, and Clothes From Xue and Sold Them. At This Point, Xue Also Realized That She Had Met a Bandit, So at About 12 PM That Night, She Took the Opportunity to Escape. She Was Lost on the Road and Did Not Know How to Get Home. She Was Seen by a Chinese Constable Patrolling the Street. Because It Was Late at Night,</p>
<h3>It Was Quiet</h3>
<p>Why Would a Young Woman Be Wandering Alone on the Street? She Was Brought to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. The Police Chief Asked Her About What Happened and Transferred Xue to the Xinzha Police Station. Her Father Was Called and Took Her Home First. Until 4 PM the Day Before Yesterday, Kan Jisheng Was Arrested by Detective Yang on Shanhai Pass Road. He Was Taken to the Police Station and Detained. Yesterday Morning, He Was Escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Tingqi Was Appointed to Hear the Case. Because This Case Was Related to Morality, He Ordered That Spectators Be Prohibited. The Police Lawyer Li Zhishan Described the Above Situation in Detail, Saying That the Police Station Was Now Prosecuting According to Articles 240 and 257 of the Criminal Code, Because</p>
<h3>Caiyue is Fifteen Years Old</h3>
<p>Regardless of Whether She Is Willing to Have a Relationship With the Defendant, It Should Be Considered Rape and Severely Punished, Next, Xue Caiyue Claimed That She Was Born in November When She Was Fifteen Years Old. The Defendant Was a Partner in My Cousin Wang Jinrong's Shoe Store, So I Met Him. On the Sixteenth of This Month at Eight O'Clock, I Went Out to Boil Water and Met Kan at the Stove. He Then Asked Me to Take My Belongings and Run Away. So at 6 PM, I Took My Belongings in a Bag, Which Included Gold, Silver, and Clothes, to the Intersection of Datong Road to Meet the Defendant. I Hired a Rickshaw and Went Straight to the Jinbu Hotel to Open a Room. The Defendant Then Committed Indecent Acts. I Wanted to Refuse, But He Threatened Me, Saying That If I Did Not Agree, He Would Kill Me.</p>
<h3>I Could Not Resist</h3>
<p>I Was Raped. The Next Day, We Went to the Hengtong Hotel and I Was Raped Twice. On the Eighteenth, I Was Taken to a Friend's House at Hujiamuqiao to Stay for One Night. The Next Day, I Took the Opportunity to Escape. I Was Arrested and Brought to the Police Station. All My Clothes and Gold Rings Were Cheated Away by Kan at the Jinbu Hotel. Under Questioning, the Defendant Confessed That on the Sixteenth, Xue Told Xiansheng to Call Me, Saying That She Heard That Her Parents Wanted to Sell Her to Hankou for 400 Dollars, Please Help Me, She Voluntarily Followed Me, At That Time, Xue Did Not Have Clothes and Was Wearing Slippers, I Bought a Pair of Nude-Colored Dancing Stockings for Her at the Jinbu Hotel for One Dollar and Ninety Cents as a Gift, As for Having Sex With Xue, He Admitted Without Reservation, Finally, Under the Assignment of a Lawyer by the Court to Defend the Defendant, Judge Wu Pronounced That the Defendant Kan Jisheng Was Sentenced to Five Years of Imprisonment for Continuously Raping a Girl Under the Age of Sixteen. The Number of Days in Custody Before the Judgment Was Final Was Reduced by One Day for Every Two Days.</p>
<h3>Communist Self-Confession or Incitement to Strike?</h3>
<p>Both Sides Hold Different Views and Are Ordered to Post Bail for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Tian Fuyuan, a telephone company coolie from Yangzhou, had a conflict with Ding Zhiyi and Yu Jun at the Tongfuyuan Teahouse at No. 495 Jiujiang Road yesterday. Tian Ming captured Ding and Yu and brought them to the Old Gate Police Station, saying that the two had instigated him to incite all the workers of the telephone company to go on strike, or they would be disadvantaged. The police chief then detained Ding and Yu. This morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation by Judge Qian. The Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi explained that they were being charged with articles 316 and 319 of the Criminal Code, but according to the two defendants, they were formerly Communists, but after surrendering, they are now working as secret agents for the Supervision Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Yu was also a telephone company coolie, not only working with Tian, but also being a comrade. Because Tian is still a Communist, Yu advised Tian on the 18th of this month to repent and surrender, and not to be a tool for others. Tian was very moved at first and expressed his desire to abandon the dark and turn to the light, agreeing to fill out a surrender form on the 24th and go to the Continental Commercial Bank on the 25th to take a photo. That's why yesterday he invited Tian to fulfill the agreement, but unexpectedly Tian gathered thirty or forty people to wait at the teahouse. When Ding and Yu arrived, they immediately instigated the crowd to commit violence, and so on. A certain inspector from the Municipal Public Security Bureau also went to court to prove that Ding, Yu, and others had reported Tian Fuyuan's surrender to the Supervision Office beforehand. Judge Qian Verified the Confession and, Considering the Seriousness of the Case, Ordered Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant to Post 300 Yuan Bail Each and Change the Date for Further Investigation.</p>

<h3>Reader's Advice</h3>
<p>Education and Society</p>
<p>—Letter from Mr. Liu Henhen of Jiangxi—</p>
<p>The current education is only accessible to the wealthy, and the poor are mostly excluded; especially the children of farmers in remote rural areas, who simply have no opportunity to receive education. Everyone acknowledges this abnormal phenomenon, and it is not my biased opinion.</p>
<p>Sir, my hometown is also a remote rural village. It has not been favored by the education authorities to establish a national school. It is pitiful that more than a hundred innocent and lively children have become illiterate because they have no books to read. Now, I want to establish a primary school in my hometown (divided into four classes, with three teachers and expenses of about 800 yuan) to help the children who have dropped out of school. However, there is no funding. The usual methods of raising school funds are nothing more than soliciting donations from outside, allocating public property, and collecting public land, etc. Solicit donations from outside? This matter depends entirely on extensive social connections to succeed. I am a young man with few friends and extremely limited social connections. This matter is certainly not worth discussing. Allocate public property? Only people with power can do it. I am a powerless young man and have no contact with the local government. This kind of thing certainly cannot be realized. Collect public land? The wasteland and barren mountains in my hometown are very scarce and not easy to collect. Even if it can be collected, it requires considerable financial resources to obtain production. This kind of pie-in-the-sky thing is also useless. Other than this, the only option is to take out my own money, but unfortunately, I am a poor man. Where would I get the money to start a school? From a practical observation, it must be done. However, the scope of the initiative cannot be reduced, and there is no funding. Such a thing is really difficult. Sir, I have thought about this problem for a long time and asked many scholars, but I have not received a good solution. I have long admired your extraordinary knowledge and skill in resolving difficulties. I am writing to ask for your guidance. Please advise me quickly.</p>
<p>Answer: "The children of farmers in remote rural areas simply have no opportunity to receive education." This is one of the phenomena of the current abnormal society. If you only want to find a solution from this phenomenon itself and not from the driving force behind it, then there is no hope at all. Under the current social, political, and economic conditions, not to mention you, since you have neither money nor power, thinking of running a school in the countryside is more difficult than climbing to heaven. Even if your school is well-run, what benefit would it bring to the current overall social injustice? I say this not to give you "cold comfort," but to ask you to use a sociological perspective to pursue and find a way out more deeply—if you go to the countryside to run a school like this, it is not that we do not approve, but we really have no skills to advise you—</p>

Xu Songming, the president of Beiping University, Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, Mei Yiqi, the president of Tsinghua University, and Li Zheng, the president of Normal University, have all notified the students of their respective colleges to attend classes as usual. The Women's College of Arts and Sciences of Beiping University originally planned to temporarily move to Suzhou. A few days ago, the students were waiting at the station for the train when President Gu Cheng rushed to the scene and relayed He Yingqin's message, saying that the situation was expected to ease. The students then unloaded their luggage and returned to the college one after another. According to President Gu Cheng, "Because the situation has eased, our college will not move to Suzhou for the time being. More than a hundred students have left Beiping, and more than a hundred students are still in Beiping and attending classes as usual. The date of the final exam has not yet been decided and will be in line with the actions of the various colleges." The presidents of the national universities in Beiping have decided on the following measures to ensure student safety: (1) Students who wish to leave Beiping may apply for leave to return home. (2) Students who do not return to Beiping will attend classes as usual. (3) The various colleges and universities will not move south for the time being. (4) The Ministry of Education will be notified by telegram of the student safety measures. In addition, many students from national and private universities in Beiping have left the schools. Now that the situation is gradually becoming peaceful, the Ministry of Education in Nanjing has ordered the universities to persuade students to attend classes with peace of mind and not to suspend classes unless absolutely necessary. However, as of today, there are still very few students attending classes at the various schools. The schools only ring the bell to start classes on time, but there are no students listening to the lectures. In addition, middle schools, such as Pingzhong, the High School Affiliated to the Normal University, the municipal middle schools in Beiping, Yijiao, Chunming Women's High School Affiliated to the Normal University, Huabei Middle School, etc., will still be closed for one day today (25th).</p>

<h3>Deliberations on the Improvement of the Curriculum of Various Chinese Children's Middle Schools under the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>The Education Committee of the Public Works Department previously appointed a subcommittee to study the curriculum of various bureau-established schools. The subcommittee has now reported the results of its investigation and research to the Education Committee. The proposals in the report regarding various Chinese children's middle schools are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) According to the survey, the subjects offered in various Chinese children's middle schools are generally the same as the national standard curriculum. The main difference lies in the language used for instruction. It is now suggested that the curriculum standards should follow the national regulations, but due to the special circumstances of Shanghai, appropriate modifications should be made where necessary. (2) In all grades of the affiliated primary schools, Chinese should be used for teaching as much as possible. In junior high school, Chinese and English should be used equally. In senior high school, about two-thirds of the instruction should be in English. (3) The Chinese language used for teaching should be the national language. (4) To gradually transform the schools into pure middle schools, the affiliated primary school grades should be gradually reduced. In the future, a preparatory grade should also be retained before junior high school. (5) Enrollment of students in various middle schools should be open to the public. (6) In the four male middle schools, in addition to the core subjects following common standards, Gezhi Public School should focus on science and technology, and Nie Zhongcheng Public School should focus on vocational education. (7) The teaching of science should gradually increase the use of Chinese. (8) All four middle schools should increase their scientific equipment. (9) In lower grades, 理科 (General Science) can be used as textbooks, while in higher grades, chemistry and physics should be the main subjects. (10) In the affiliated primary school and junior high school grades, whole-grade singing should be part of the curriculum, and schools should encourage whole-school chorus. (11) All grades should have physical education as a subject. (12) All textbooks used by the schools must first obtain the permission of the Director of Education. The textbooks of each school should be made as consistent as possible. (13) The current practice of each school issuing diplomas independently should be stopped immediately. Standard curriculum graduation examinations should be held, and all senior high school students should be required to take the exam. Students who wish to participate in equivalent examinations elsewhere may do so. (14) The issuance of diplomas from bureau-established schools should be based on the report of a special examination committee. The examination committee should be composed of personnel from within and outside the bureau. Regarding items 13 and 14, the chairman of the subcommittee stated that after November of this year, the current Hong Kong University entrance examination procedure will be cancelled. It is hoped that the university will recognize the bureau's diplomas as qualifications for admission. Furthermore, after the implementation of this reform plan, it is expected that more students will complete the entire curriculum. As for expenses, using the national language instead of the Shanghai dialect may require a slight increase in expenditure, but this change will be implemented gradually. Also, the necessary facilities for science may cost more than what is currently spent.</p>
<p>In addition, the Director of Education reported that the number of students in junior high school and above has decreased significantly, but recently the number of students in higher grades has increased. Furthermore, after the reform, students from external primary schools who wish to enter bureau-established middle schools can reduce language difficulties. The ratio of Chinese to English application must pay attention to the needs of Chinese society. The subcommittee referred to the current practices of Gezhi Public School on this point. After consideration, the Education Committee expressed extreme satisfaction with the work of the subcommittee. All of its proposals were resolved to be adopted immediately. This case was submitted to the Board of Directors on May 24 and approved by the Board of Directors.</p>

<h3>President's Address</h3>
<p>Lu Dipin, Chairman of the Provincial Government, served as the President of the Congress. He happened to be going to Beijing on official business and could not return to participate.

Please preside over everything and read the following words: 'Eminent scholars gather, Zhejiang is widely promoted, the congress is grandly opened, moral progress is first, martial arts and writing are combined, happy groups strengthen the country, holding ambition and being diligent, striving to be heroes, ten years of education, establishing this criterion.'"

<h3>時報誓死力守P]</h3>
<p>The Times fought to defend with all its might.</p>
<p>下半時時報改變策約、多守少攻、蔣宗道與王孟年、李庚西等、不出中線半步、分頭迎戰、晨報雖稱驍勇、但以障碍重重不　　易得手、老滕更帮助後防將士作困獸之鬭、彈火如雨、絶不能破此銅牆鐵璧、韶華不再轉眼鳴金、晨報以四勝一和、獲得本届冠軍、晨報陣容</p>
<p>In the second half, the Times changed tactics, focusing more on defense and less on offense. Jiang Zongdao, Wang Mengnian, Li Gengxi, and others did not step beyond the halfway line, meeting the challenge head-on. Although the Morning News was known for its bravery, the many obstacles made it difficult for them to score. Old Teng even helped the defending soldiers fight like trapped beasts, with shots raining down, but they could not break through this impregnable defense. Youthful vigor passed, and the final whistle blew in an instant. The Morning News won this year's championship with four wins and one draw. Morning News lineup:</p>

<p>—各隊技藝槪觀隨便談不作準</p>
<p>—A Casual, Unofficial Overview of Each Team's Skills</p>
<p>余爲六報部際比賽作稿、向未涉及闔隊與個人之技藝、蓋部際之主旨在趣味、而不在技藝、正所謂君子爭、不斤斤乎勝負、兹部際比賽已圓滿結果、余似有骾在喉、頗思一吐爲快、信筆寫來、絶無成見、若在塲諸公視爲汝南月旦、則吾豈敢、申報</p>
<p>In my writing about the six newspapers' interdepartmental competition, I have never touched upon the skills of the entire team or individual players, because the main purpose of the interdepartmental competition is fun, not skill. As the saying goes, "Gentlemen compete without being overly concerned with winning or losing." Now that the interdepartmental competition has come to a successful conclusion, I feel like something is stuck in my throat, and I would like to express myself freely. I write spontaneously, without any prejudice. If the gentlemen present regard this as a critical assessment, then I would not dare. *Shen Bao*:</p>
<p>本届自一和一勝後、希望極高、精神亦旺、不幸敗於晨報、兜頭冷水、天下之失意事莫過於此、主將孫勝盤射俱佳、奔砲亦快、中堅謝宏、亦頗出色、阻攔搶刦之功夫、已臻爐火純青之候、後衛李尊庸亦屬有數之人材、穏重矯健、兼而有之、門將蔣槐青、自是斵輪老手、無懈可撃、朱銘新陸爾强等各有特長晨報</p>
<p>After one draw and one win in this year's competition, hopes were extremely high, and the spirit was also strong. Unfortunately, they were defeated by the Morning News. It was like a bucket of cold water being poured over their heads; nothing could be more disappointing. The main player, Sun Sheng, was excellent in dribbling and shooting, and his running shots were also fast. The center, Xie Hong, was also quite outstanding, and his skills in blocking and intercepting had reached perfection. The defender, Li Zunyong, was also a talented individual, both steady and agile. The goalkeeper, Jiang Huaiqing, was a seasoned veteran, without any weaknesses. Zhu Mingxin, Lu Erqiang, and others each had their own strengths. *Morning News*:</p>
<p>晨報一軍驃悍、遠超他隊、前鋒後衞泰半均係小將、伶俐狡猾、時時弄敵於股掌之上、主帥瞿越、氣吞山岳、藝技精良、射門尤見功夫、本届獲得第一、此公居功獨多、他如胡宗藩·金煕·蔣曉光等、均爲上中之材、全隊合作功夫尤見佳妙、苟假以時日、必成一勁旅無疑、時事</p>
<p>The first team of the Morning News was brave and fierce, far surpassing the other teams. Most of the forwards and defenders were young players, clever and cunning, often manipulating their opponents at will. The coach, Qu Yue, was ambitious and skilled, with exceptional shooting skills. He made the greatest contribution to winning first place this year. Others, such as Hu Zongfan, Jin Xi, and Jiang Xiaoguang, were all above-average talents. The teamwork of the entire team was particularly excellent. Given time, they will undoubtedly become a strong force. *Shishi News*:</p>
<p>時事新報擁有足球宿將蔣湘青、運動健將夏開明及李卓真聶世琦輩、均屬庸庸俊俊者也、本届確有奪標之雄心、不幸與申報打或和局、致少晨報一分、傷心如何、論軍紀當推該隊爲較佳、進攻退守已具有强隊之雛形、下届實有非常之希望也、新聞</p>
<p>The *Shishi News* had veteran football player Jiang Xiangqing, athletic stars Xia Kaiming, and Li Zhuozhen and Nie Shiqi. All of them were capable and talented. This year, they certainly had the ambition to win the championship. Unfortunately, they drew a tie with the *Shen Bao*, giving the Morning News one less point. How heartbreaking! In terms of discipline, this team was considered the best. Their offensive and defensive capabilities had already formed the prototype of a strong team, and they have great hope for the next competition. *Xinwen Bao*:</p>
<p>新聞報之實力、僅亞時事晨報一籌、進攻力量極爲雄渾活潑、祇惜球運不佳、本届分數遂較他隊爲少、然觀察其負球之數、未有出兩隻者、由此可見該報之實力不可侮也沈美鎭蔣宗義陸詒胥爲前鋒有數之人材、裴順元穏健、蔣劍侯鎭靜不亂、尤以戰民報一役、允爲本季拿手傑作、時報</p>
<p>The strength of the *Xinwen Bao* was only slightly inferior to the *Shishi News* and the Morning News. Their offensive power was extremely vigorous and lively. It was a pity that their luck was not good, and their score in this competition was less than that of other teams. However, observing the number of goals they conceded, none exceeded two. From this, it can be seen that the strength of this newspaper should not be underestimated. Shen Meizhen, Jiang Zongyi, and Lu Yixu were talented forwards. Pei Shunyuan was steady, and Jiang Jianhou was calm and composed. In particular, their match against the *Min Bao* was undoubtedly their masterpiece this season. *The Times*:</p>
<p>時報苟能每塲以第一戰之精神與夫衝剌、則本届不獨得分不致如此悽慘、或將有冠軍之希望焉、健將如滕樹榖蔣宗道李庚西王孟年邵翼之等、大刀闊斧有名將風度、其失敗主因卽在勇而無謀、不善聯絡、往者又矣、來者可追、枕戈以待來年、奇恥未嘗不可雪也、民報</p>
<p>If *The Times* could have maintained the spirit and drive of their first match in every game, then not only would their score in this competition not have been so miserable, but they might have had a chance to win the championship. Strong players such as Teng Shugu, Jiang Zongdao, Li Gengxi, Wang Mengnian, and Shao Yizhi had the style of famous generals, with bold and decisive actions. The main reason for their failure was their bravery without strategy and their poor coordination. What is past is past, but the future can be pursued. Prepare for next year, and the humiliation may be wiped away. *Min Bao*:</p>
<p>民報之後防實力、大可睥睨一切、所虧缺者、前鋒太無聯絡耳、前鋒無能、则儘人攻、而不能攻人矣、安得不敗、吳中一·江紅蕉·吳東三公·胥皆智勇雙兼之上將、牡丹雖好、苦無緑葉扶持、惜哉</p>
<p>The defensive strength of the *Min Bao* was enough to overlook everything else. What they lacked was coordination among the forwards. If the forwards are incompetent, they can only defend against others' attacks and cannot attack others. How can they not be defeated? Wu Zhongyi, Jiang Hongjiao, and Wu Dongsangong were all generals with both intelligence and courage. The peony is beautiful, but it is a pity that there are no green leaves to support it. What a pity!</p>

Since the editorial departments of the six newspapers held the interdepartmental football tournament, the colleagues in the business department have also been ambitious and eager to try. Now, the business department's football team has been organized and established. It has been agreed with Fada Automobile Company to borrow the Aurora University playground at 9:30 AM on the 29th of this month for the first friendly match. At that time, everyone will be brave, and everyone will strive to be the first. There will definitely be a fierce and humorous battle. The lineup of this newspaper is listed below:</p>

<p>Things often happen beyond our expectations. This Sunday was originally planned for the official opening, with a match against Shanghai High School. Who knew that the Zhejiang Provincial Games would open today? Most of the team members have gone south to fulfill their duty of reporting on the event for the sake of the “bread problem”. They will probably not be able to return to Shanghai until five or six days later. We now express our apologies to the teachers of Shanghai High School. Once all the team members have returned to Shanghai, we will announce the location and date of the match and fulfill our promise to start the fight.</p>

<p>無線電展覽特刑　引言  記者</p>
<p>Special Issue on Radio Exhibition Introduction Reporter</p>
<p>或問曰：寇深矣、國危矣，無綫電非當務之急，申報館何爲而有展覽會之舉？應之曰：誠然。然而無線電發明於世界大戰以前，盛興於大戰方酣之際。在戰時，歐洲各國非皆在危急存亡之秋耶？何無線電之獨能爲人研究利用也。</p>
<p>Someone asked: "The enemy is deep, and the country is in danger. Radio is not an urgent matter. Why is the *Shen Bao* holding an exhibition?" I replied: "Indeed. However, radio was invented before World War I and flourished during the height of the war. During the war, were not all European countries in a critical autumn of survival? Why was radio the only thing that people could research and utilize?"</p>
<p>無線電雖非砲艦，飛機，坦克車可比。然於國防及交通敎育上之重要，固已盡人皆知。年來我國研究者旣日漸衆多，播音事業亦日見發達。此實良好之現象。吾人决不當以國難日亟之故，掩旗息鼓，阻其進展。而正宜乘國人激於義憤思圖報國之際，提倡而推奬之。設以此而能引起國人研究學術之興趣，則將來之效果，恐較目前伏處室隅，空言抵抗，勝過萬萬也。</p>
<p>Although radio cannot be compared to battleships, airplanes, or tanks, its importance in national defense, transportation, and education is already well known. In recent years, the number of researchers in our country has gradually increased, and the broadcasting industry has also become more developed. This is indeed a good phenomenon. We must never cease progress, cover up the flags and drums due to the urgency of national difficulties. Instead, we should take advantage of the patriotic sentiments of the people and promote and reward it. If this can arouse the interest of the people in studying academics, then the future effects will be far more effective than simply hiding in the corner and talking about resistance.</p>
<p>我國無線電事業雖漸見發展、然而機件用品鮮能自製，使用常識亦未普及。如何可以促進自製機件灌輸常識於一般民衆，恐又當以展覽會之舉爲最有效果，至所以邀請外商參加者，則以他山之石可資攻錯耳。</p>
<p>Although the radio industry in our country has gradually developed, we are rarely able to manufacture our own equipment and supplies, and common knowledge of its use has not been popularized. How can we promote the self-manufacturing of parts and instill common knowledge in the general public? I am afraid that holding an exhibition will be the most effective way. As for inviting foreign merchants to participate, it is to use the stones of other mountains to correct our own mistakes.</p>
<p>最後本館謹向參加展覽會陳列之中外各商家及借供展覽會會場之湖社，致誠摯之謝意。</p>
<p>Finally, this newspaper would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Chinese and foreign merchants who participated in the exhibition and to the Lake Society for lending the exhibition venue.</p>
<p>無線電展覽會祝辭  曹仲淵</p>
<p>Radio Exhibition Congratulatory Speech Cao Zhongyuan</p>
<p>在中國無線電工業發展中，這個展覽會可算是過渡時代新興工業一個有意義的舉動，尤其是著名的申報來提倡，確值得吾們去參加和頌揚。</p>
<p>In the development of the radio industry in China, this exhibition can be regarded as a meaningful move for the emerging industry in the transitional era. In particular, the promotion by the famous *Shen Bao* is indeed worthy of our participation and praise.</p>
<p>無線電播音輸進中國，祇有十五年工夫，回溯十年以前和今日比較起來，真有不少的進步，這就是：</p>
<p>Radio broadcasting has only been introduced into China for 15 years. Looking back at the comparison between ten years ago and today, there has indeed been a lot of progress. This is:</p>
<p>（一）電台數目在民國十一年的時候，祇有上海南京路五十號新孚洋行一家現在增加到七十多家。（二）電力從五十華脱增加到一千華脱（上海）乃至七萬五千華脱（南京）（三）節目數量從三行增加到數十行</p>
<p>(1) The number of radio stations in the eleventh year of the Republic of China was only one, namely the Xinfu Foreign Company at No. 50 Nanjing Road, Shanghai. Now, it has increased to more than 70. (2) The power has increased from 50 watts to 1,000 watts (Shanghai) and even 75,000 watts (Nanjing). (3) The number of programs has increased from three lines to dozens of lines.</p>
<p>節目内容從極簡單鄙俗的進步到敎育文化的播音時間從下午五時以後三數小時增加到全日全夜播音工作從消遣無謂的進步到募捐救國（四）收發音機及其另件從舶來品發展模彷自製的（五）無線電刋物在十年以前没有一份現在已有多種了以上五項最值得注意的，祗是第四項，因爲這是科學工業發展的萌芽有關國計民生的。</p>
<p>The content of the programs has progressed from extremely simple and vulgar to educational and cultural. The broadcasting time has increased from a few hours after 5 PM to all day and all night. The broadcasting work has progressed from frivolous entertainment to fundraising to save the country. (4) Transceivers and their parts have developed from imported goods to imitation and self-made. (5) There were no radio publications ten years ago, but now there are many. Among the above five items, the most noteworthy is only the fourth, because it is the budding of scientific and industrial development, which is related to the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>每年八九月的時候，我們若到倫敦Ｏlympia或是柏林Ｋaiserdamm去參觀他們的無線電展覽會，陳列品數量之多，真要看得目亂眼花，精疲力盡，最可怕的是他們祇是單獨提倡他們自已的東西，全塲數百家竟然找不出一件東西是舶來品，並且還在會塲到處張貼着觸目驚心的圖畫和字句，説是Ｂritishmake，以示真正的國貨，德國比較地没有英國那様尖刻，荷蘭飛利浦也得分占一席之地，但是遠地排列在大會門牆之外，不能混雜在大廳之中，這顯然又有賓主之分，所以法國在一九三○年籌備開萬國無線電展覽會的當兒，單獨拒絶德國去參加，這裏除了排擠外貨之外帶有外交政治的含義。</p>
<p>Every year in August and September, if we go to London Olympia or Berlin Kaiserdamm to visit their radio exhibitions, the number of exhibits is so large that it is really dizzying and exhausting. The most frightening thing is that they only promote their own things. Hundreds of companies throughout the venue cannot find a single thing that is an imported product. Moreover, they also post eye-catching pictures and words everywhere in the venue, saying that it is "British-made" to show genuine domestic products. Germany is relatively not as sharp as Britain, and Philips of the Netherlands also has to occupy a place, but it is arranged far away outside the gate of the conference and cannot be mixed in the hall. This obviously has the distinction between guests and hosts. Therefore, when France was preparing to hold the World Radio Exhibition in 1930, it refused Germany to participate alone. In addition to excluding foreign goods, this has diplomatic and political implications.</p>
<p>看了英德展覽會，再來看這個展覽會，在下有以下三種希望（一）我們無線電工業現在是很幼稚的，有西洋貨來給我們做榜様，我們是很歡迎的，諸君莫説今年國貨年，不必去提倡西洋貨。（二）無線電工業在西洋各國因爲有專利權及貿易圈的限制，又因爲有科學</p>
<p>After watching the British and German exhibitions, and then looking at this exhibition, I have the following three hopes: (1) Our radio industry is very naive now. We are very welcome to have Western goods to be our role models. Gentlemen, don’t say that this year is the year of domestic goods, so there is no need to promote Western goods. (2) The radio industry in Western countries is restricted by patent rights and trade circles. Also, because of science</p>
<p>敎育的助成，努力進取的功績，他們俱能獨出心裁，不絶創造，我們現在尙無專利權的束縳，應該趕快去仿造，無須誇口説發明。（三）西洋科學工業發達的國家，雖是學者，也不免互相批評，互相攻讦訐，</p>
<p>Education, hard work and achievements, they are all able to come up with unique ideas and create constantly. We do not have the constraints of patent rights now, so we should quickly imitate them. There is no need to boast about invention. (3) In Western countries with developed science and industry, even scholars cannot avoid criticizing and attacking each other.</p>
<p>我們現在粗淺的可笑，應該彼此集中精力經濟合作起來，纔有希望。敬祝吾國無線電工業發展無量。</p>
<p>We are now laughably superficial. We should concentrate our efforts and cooperate economically with each other before there is hope. I wish the radio industry in our country unlimited development.</p>

<p>Grand Exhibition</p>
<p>「申報無線電展覽會」開幕以後，絡續到會參觀者，平均每日五千餘人，但因會塲狹小，甚爲擁擠，在場任招待者爲申報廣告部秦熹敏君及各陳列商家特派員等，均異常忙碌，導引參觀，解釋種切，務使參觀者滿意而歸。然而時光飛逝，此千載一時的盛會，祇剩今明兩日，預料此兩日中參觀者必更形擁擠也。</p>
<p>After the opening of the "*Shen Bao* Radio Exhibition", an average of more than 5,000 visitors arrived to visit every day. However, due to the small size of the venue, it was very crowded. Qin Ximin, from the advertising department of *Shen Bao*, and special commissioners from various exhibiting merchants were extremely busy, guiding visitors and explaining everything to ensure that visitors were satisfied. However, time flies, and this once-in-a-lifetime grand event is only the last two days. It is expected that the visitors will be even more crowded in these two days.</p>

<p>Commercial News, Finance, Guangdong Merchants Vigorously Purchase, Gold Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>Second Bombay Falls, Chips Run Dry, Rebounding to 11.62 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market fell the day before yesterday, and rose again yesterday, making it extremely difficult to grasp the elusive nature of the market. Trading was brisk in the morning and light in the afternoon. Guangdong merchants Hengxing worked hard to buy gold bars, but the morning market was not particularly tense. This was mainly because Dalian merchants and others were profiting from arbitrage on the US dollar forwards, providing supply to Zhou Yin. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets and exchange rates all declined, causing prices to open higher. The morning market moved sideways due to a stable domestic market. In the afternoon, chips appeared to be running dry, Bombay fell by five annas, and the exchange market was briefly tense, rising relatively quickly. There were no special changes throughout the day. Guangdong merchants Hengxing imported over 3,000 taels in total (Shen Kang Agency accounted for the majority), with a premium of 61 yuan based on Chichi. Swap spreads for June and July were 13 yuan. The daily market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 971.2 yuan, rebounding 8.3 yuan compared to yesterday's close. Goods opened at 1 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with British tight at 0.0625 and US tight at 25. Recent bids included British exchange at 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 875 farthings, and US exchange at 4 yuan, 3125. Fuyu, Wanxing, Yifeng, Yongzhaofeng, Changfu, and Changchang all sold off. Although Huabi purchased September US dollars at 0.0625 (but it was already firm), 25. Korea also offered July US dollars at 8125, falling to 69.4 yuan. Guangdong merchants Hengxing came in to buy gold bars, Yuanmao vigorously purchased, Fuyu also delivered, and rebounded to over 71 yuan. Huabi bought August at 875, Cuitai advanced to 1.6 yuan. HSBC quoted British flat and US slightly lower by 125. By the time of the announcement, it had already fallen back down. Yifeng, Yongheng, Yu, and Richang sold gold bars. Huabi sold August at 8125, retreating to 69.5 yuan. After entering the market, although the exchange market was stable, Guangdong merchants Hengxing, Dalian merchants Shunli, and others vigorously advanced, causing an upward trend. Ultimately, due to a silent domestic market, it hovered around 1 yuan. Under pressure, Hengxing continued to buy in, and Dadecheng also took the opportunity to deliver gold bars. Although it rose to over 2 yuan, Huabi came out with June US dollars at 4375, and HSBC came out with July at 625, retreating to around 1 yuan. Hengxing's buying interest was strong. Tianfeng, Shuizhifeng, and Yongyi also chased purchases, and it rose to 72.8 yuan. Zhaofengchang sold gold bars, and the market fell again. It was idle for a long time afterwards. Later, due to Yuanshengyong selling gold bars and retail investors selling off, it fell to 70 yuan. Yuanheng and Yuanchun limited purchases, and Hengyu goods continued to purchase. Huabi and Mitsui both profited from arbitrage on September at 5 yuan, pushing it up to 2.3 yuan. The noon close was 971.9 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 972.5 yuan, and goods opened at 2.2 yuan. Hengyu and Yuanheng Tongyu Run successively advanced, causing it to rise. There were very few transactions, and banks also had no transactions. The market was idle for a long time. When Bombay telegraphed a fall of five annas, Dadecheng and Fuyu both advanced, breaking through 5 yuan. Yukang also purchased. Mitsui bought September US dollars at 9375, Shunli and Yuanheng advanced further, reaching 6 yuan. Huabi came out with September US dollars at 875, Cuitai sold slightly, resulting in 4.5 yuan. Qianchang, Xiangyuanheng, Fuchang, and Yukang all advanced, while Hongli, Tianfeng, and Yongze sold, resulting in a protracted struggle around 5 yuan. Chips seemed to be running dry, and people were thinking about prosperity. The exchange market was once tighter, and September US dollars at 875 were difficult to settle. Richang, Changsheng, Yong, Tianfeng, and Yongyi all successively advanced, and it jumped to 77.3 yuan. Mitsui sold July US dollars at half a yuan, and Dadecheng sold to within 5 yuan. Pan Gen profited from arbitrage on September US dollars at 875 and remained stable. Later, because this price was difficult to sell, Yuanshengyong, Zhaofengchang, and Wanxing all sold off, retreating to 3.5 yuan. Shortly before the close, it was 974.5 yuan, and goods were auctioned at the same price. During the day, the highest price was 977.3 yuan, and the lowest was 969.4 yuan, with fluctuations of 7.9 yuan. The result was a rebound of 11.6 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The announcement price was 1,000 yuan due to HSBC Bank's US dollar listing shrinking by 125, calculated at 4 yuan. According to the closing price, the implied premium was about 5.5 yuan, a reduction of more than 6 yuan compared to the previous close. The book price for this month was 1,004 yuan, the book price for June was 984 yuan, and the book price for July was 972 yuan. The morning water supplement was 1,004 yuan, and the afternoon water supplement was 1,007 yuan. Yesterday's Chichi price was calculated at 61 yuan, with a lack of transactions, and a lack of counterparts for swaps. Hengxing only transferred 14 taels of gold bars for June to Yingfengheng. Changshengyong discounted 35 taels for June and July to Futaiheng, at 13 yuan. As of the day before yesterday, there were still 2,156 taels left for this month, and 5,439 taels for June. Trading in the market was brisk in the morning and light in the afternoon, with Guangdong merchants vigorously purchasing gold bars. However, because Dalian merchants and general foreign exchange arbitrageurs were actively hedging, the morning market was evenly matched internally. The market only started to run dry after the resumption of trading. In summary, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Tianfengyong, Dadecheng, Yukang, Yuanheng, Zhifengyong, and others all advanced, while Wanxing, Yifengyong, Yuanshengyong, Shunli, Hongli, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, and others all sold. Goods were vigorously purchased. Dalian merchants Shunli and Wanxing squeezed out 400-500 taels, Guangdong merchants Hengxing advanced over 500 taels, and Shen Kang transferred over 900 taels. There were a total of 21,231 taels of gold bars for July. British and US foreign exchange domestic markets were silent.</p>
<p>—Gold Industry's Acquisition成交少過程微緊—</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegrams, both near and deferred terms shrunk by 125, the British pound against the US dollar fell by 1 point, and the US dollar against the British pound fell by 75. Recent British exchange opened slightly tighter at 0.0625, at 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 875 farthings. New York silver prices shrank by 125, deferred silver prices fell by 3.8 cents, and US cotton fell by more than 10 pounds. Private telegrams were therefore slightly lower by 25. The opening selling price for recent US exchange was 4 yuan, 3125, tighter by 25 compared to the previous close. It trended firmer after the opening, with both bank acquisitions and sales. HSBC quoted British flat and US slightly lower by 125. The domestic market was extremely silent, with trading light and sideways. The noon close was flat, and trading remained sparse in the afternoon, with a quiet trend. The gold industry's acquisition was relatively strong, Bombay telegraphed a slight decline of 5 annas, and it tightened midway. Trading was minimal, and the close was slightly tighter than noon. Recent selling prices were calculated as British exchange at 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 8125 farthings, and US exchange at 4 yuan, 25, tighter by 125 for British and 3125 for US compared to the previous close. The banking sector and the gold industry had both acquisitions and sales, but the gold industry ultimately squeezed out about 300,000, and Guangdong merchants acquired over 100,000. The day's bank transactions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening selling price for recent British exchange was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 1875 farthings.

The British pound against the US dollar opened at 3 yuan, 9 jiao, and 1 fen, and 25 li. Financial Stability Before the Summer Festival</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of silver and cash business was quite sluggish, and interbank lending rates continued to decline, opening at only 3 points yesterday, a decrease of 2 points compared to the previous day. People generally believed that there were no significant shortages of funds among fellow merchants, so there was no possibility of price increases. However, the cash shortage was exacerbated by water, because the short-term funds were insufficient for use, leading to a steady increase. Yesterday, the market price was 2 jiao, 8 fen, and 9 li. In terms of check trading, over 5.7 million was transferred in the morning, and over 700,000-800,000 was newly traded. Over 600,000 was traded in the afternoon, over 700,000 was traded in the Small General Association, over 2.1 million was traded in foreign collateral loans, and over 2.1 million was retrieved and issued in banknotes. There were no reports of customer sources, and the outflow was only 200,000. According to bank collection news, foreign merchants collected 1.45 million in silver for check payments, 2.67 million in foreign currency, and 4.67 million in silver for various goods, exchange pledges, special miscellaneous items, and collection of silver, 4.23 million in foreign currency, and 1.2 million was warehoused.

<p>The Progress of Public Debt Delivery in May</p>
<p>The exchange delivered 11,025,000, and 9,360,000 was delivered privately.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the date for the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange to handle the delivery of futures for May. The process went smoothly. The total delivery amount was 20,385,000, excluding 9,360,000 for transfer settlement and private delivery. The amount delivered at the exchange was 11,025,000. The off-exchange delivery volume of each broker could not be verified, but it was roughly around 10 million. On the receiving side, most belonged to the financial sector. On the delivery side, except for a relatively large amount from a financial institution on the Bund, the rest were mostly customer groups and retail investors. Since the start of May futures trading on March 29th, taking salt tax as an example, the initial market price was 41.8 yuan, and the final market price on May 23rd was 44.3 yuan. After more than 50 days, the result was an increase of 2.5 yuan. The highest price was 44.35 yuan on May 23rd, and the lowest price was 38.5 yuan on April 19th. The difference between the highest and lowest was 5.85 yuan. Overall, the bond market was stable. There were many waves, such as direct negotiations, President Wang's inauguration, Japan's intention to abandon force, President Song's departure, the loss of Qin Island, the subsequent fall of Luandong, the increasing danger of Pingjin, and the US President's guarantee of world peace. The bad news seemed to herald the end of the world, and the good news seemed to suggest that peace was about to be realized. Market prices were in a turbulent sea. Although the twists and turns were frequent, people's hearts remained strong, and there was no drastic change. The total transaction volume was 21,307,500 yuan in more than 50 days, a staggering amount. The delivery volume was only 20-30 million. The speculative volume was considerable, enough to gauge the attitude of the people. Trading was busiest with Guangdong and Northern merchants, and the power of retail investors was also not weak. The delivery and transfer amounts for various bonds in May are listed below (unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<p>Category Futures May Total Transaction Volume Transfer Amount Delivery Amount Total Delivery and Transfer Amount 18 Customs 11,300 2,350 1,800 4,150 Disbandment 92,900 7,600 5,450 13,050 Troop Reduction 336,050 11,200 8,650 19,850 9 Customs 200,700 11,850 3,800 15,650 19 Goodness 165,200 11,550 4,900 16,450 20 206,150 14,600 10,250 24,850 20 Customs 221,800 9,350 9,500 18,850 20 Unified 320,050 10,500 9,700 20,200 20 Salt 536,400 10,700 49,600 600,300 Whole 6 22,550 1,700 4,800 6,500 96 5,300 2,000 1,050 3,050 Gold Long 1,150 200 750 950 Gold Short 1,300 Total 2,120,750 3,600 110,250 203,850</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Mixed</p>
<p>Xinfeng Trading Company reported that on Thursday (May 25th), the New York stock market was fluctuating, and traders were mostly watching due to the imminent release of the Senate's findings on the Morgan Bank investigation. The market rallied briefly in the afternoon, but ultimately weakened due to profit-taking by bulls. The day's trading volume was 4.1 million shares. The company's New York agent, Haitens Dong Company, also telegraphed that the strength of US cotton was due to general belief that cotton production would decrease, but this was questionable. Demand for spot goods was still good. According to the common opinion of brokers, the market will continue to fluctuate. The Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Price Change from Previous Day 30 Industrials 83.73 Down 0.56 20 Railroads 40.23 Down 0.05 20 Utilities 28.52 Down 0.18 40 Bonds 82.82 Up 0.43 Cotton Mill Strike Sets High Mark for Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm and the situation is hardening. Several factories in this port have experienced a strike wave due to labor compensation issues, boosting sentiment and increasing buying interest. However, most retail shorts are still looking to buy low. Raw cotton is expensive, and manufacturers are finding it difficult, so they are reluctant to sell yarn at low prices. Man-made fiber prices rose by more than one yuan.</p>
<p>The opening price of man-made fiber in the morning market was lower due to falling US cotton, but the strike at Shenxin No. 1 Factory boosted sentiment, and prices rose by 5, 6, 8, and 9 jiao to one yuan across all months. The situation was still good in the afternoon, with prices rising by 3, 5, and 6 jiao across all months. The total transaction volume for the day was 32,050 bales. Sencang sold 5,150 bales, Rongxing 700 bales, and Renfeng 550 bales. Yichang bought 900 bales, Zhenda 750 bales, Tongfu 1,400 bales, Gengfeng 1,450 bales, Dachang 750 bales, Tonghe 750 bales, and Lichang 800 bales, and Taichang 850 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Man-made Fiber Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Inventory Number August 19.79 Up 14 60,550 May 19.12 Up 12 13,000 September 19.90 Up 12 45,700 June 19.32 Up 10 45,200 October 19.94 Up 13 39,900 July 19.52 Up 12 65,750 Total 270,100</p>
<p>Current Yarn Consumption Not Bad</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are still good. The total purchase volume by various merchants for the day was 854 bales, and prices rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. The purchase volume by each merchant is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 560 Inland 168 Peers 110 Yunnan 40 Luzhou 10 Sichuan 50 Hankou 25</p>
<p>Some Received Cotton This Month</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell then rose, but with the decline in foreign cotton, sentiment weakened slightly. However, due to the lack of spot cotton, the bull momentum remains strong. As for deliveries this month, although there are more than 10,000 dan, buyers are prepared to receive them, so the market rebounded in the afternoon. The future trend will still depend on the fluctuations of US cotton. Zheng Standard Rebounded After Falling</p>
<p>The opening of the Zheng Standard market was flat, with a lack of buyers in the market. Prices fell by 1 and 2 jiao across all months. In the afternoon, there were people receiving goods for this month, and prices rose by 3 jiao. Deferred months also rose by 3 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 56,600 dan.

<p>Raw cotton mill demand has not yet developed. The source is estimated to be 50 bales of Yao cotton, with a lower grade of 46.90. The Tongyi Factory received 300 bales, sending Lingbao cotton at 51.00. The Shenxin Factory received 500 pieces. Moreover, US Cotton Was Variable and Ultimately Declined</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially weakened due to good weather, then rose due to reactive buying, and finally fell again due to profit-taking by bulls. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points, and futures prices fell by 10 to 11 points. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot prices fell by 6 points, and futures prices fell by 8 to 9 points. In the Egyptian cotton market, spot prices fell by 4 points. In the Bombay cotton market, Japanese and European exporters sold, but were offset by speculative buying and short covering. As a result, Pingar rose by half a rupee, Omura rose by 2 rupees and 7 jiao, and Bairoxi rose by 1 rupee and 7 jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (May 25th telegram):</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's source was 30-40 numbers. Since the market had been artificially raised after the cloudy weather the day before, the outbound traffic appeared sluggish in the afternoon. Because the weather cleared up yesterday, the source was larger, and people's hearts floated. The market was not active due to the small capacity of this street. Su Tongjing and Nangang Houdao prices fell by several cents to jiao, but the price of Liantang and Qingjiao special was still stable due to high quality. However, the price of shipping Bo rice was only able to increase due to competition among peers. Customers from Weihaiwei and Yantai actively bought Qingjiao, Songjiang, Fengjing, and Xinzhen and other Bo rice in packs of 1,700-1,800, but the buying price was high, making it difficult to see any fluctuations, slightly softer by a few cents. Foreign pointed rice was lacking, but was still able to stand out. The time for Yinbian Yuan should be over, and the market situation was exceptionally soft.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the source of various rivers was about 20 numbers. Baijing's movement was slow, the retail store was sluggish, and the four townships lacked transactions, so the market remained high. Medium-grade goods were nearly a chi and weak. Although the arrival of Bo rice was not much, the retail stomach was guaranteed, and the price was slightly lower by 1 jiao. The early rice showed a softening trend. The arrival of Yangjian was not prosperous, and sales were average, so the price remained high. The medium-grade was also slightly lower by 1 jiao, Dujian was slightly lower by 6-7 fen, Baiyuan's arrival was quite prosperous, there were slightly more retail sales, and the price was slightly lower by 1-2 jiao. Zao Ke Xian continued to rise by 8-9 fen. The Small Twist Was Largely Divided into Three Parts... Minhua Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market situation, machine rice was stable, brown rice continued to rise. There was a continuous source of arrivals recently, but mainly machine grinding. The arrival and storage of brown rice were both scarce, and Min merchants' purchases were quite greedy, but the owners refused to sell, so Hunan's brown oil brown and red rice each rose by 8-9 fen, selling 500 bags of opened brown red rice at a price of 7 yuan and 3 jiao, 462 bags of brown oil rice at a price of 7 yuan and 5 jiao, and 8 fen to 7 yuan and 4 jiao and 2 fen. Hunan's machine red was slightly increased due to the rise in brown red, opening 250 bags at a price of 8 yuan and 2 jiao, 6 fen to 8 yuan and 2 jiao. Jiangxi's machine early machine was roughly the same. Smaller Xian rice owners shouted high, expanding to keep out yesterday's 200 xun, priced at 7 yuan and 7 jiao and 3 fen, also increased by 3 fen. 195 bags of Wuxi machine Xian were also opened at a price of 8 yuan and a half, and all were said to be sold to Min merchants. Flour Market Mostly Reselling, Returning Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the pavilion in the morning, the months were roughly showing a flat appearance, with the arrival price of foreign wheat returning slightly by about 1 jiao to 2 jiao and 3 jiao, so a part of the people inevitably waited and watched, and the factory side still had exports, although the number was not large, foreign peers thought that it would be moved, so the buying atmosphere was restored, and the market turned flat. Afterwards, due to the slight supplement of floating air outside the industry, the closing price seemed to be slightly boosted. When the afternoon market opened, the months were all showing fatigue, because it was rumored that the Tianjin current powder reported a drop of 3 points, and there was still a return to the choice of this month, and the floating multi-transaction in the months also withdrew. The large factory limited the price to sell the deferred, and the customers mainly included the Shandong merchants slightly entering, and more were watching, so the market was declining. As a result, this month fell by 1 fen and a half compared to the previous day, June fell by 1 fen and 2 li and a half, July fell by 7 li and a half, August fell by 1 fen, and September fell by 1 fen and 2 li and a half, October fell by 7 li and a half. The Period Wheat Was Calm</p>
<p>Yesterday's period wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the months were roughly showing a calm appearance, although the foreign wheat quotation was slightly lower by 1 jiao, 2 jiao, and 3 jiao, the selling households of inland merchants had decreased after the atmosphere in Pingjin turned peaceful. Local peers had purchases due to the flour market, so the price stood firm, showing 1-2 points better compared to the previous day. However, the afternoon disks also weakened slightly due to the fatigue of the flour market. According to this situation, if the weather is good during the day, I am afraid that the inland's selling can be transferred smoothly. As a result, July was 1 point better, August was unchanged, September was 2 points better, and there was no opening in the rest of the months. The Car Bean Suddenly Rose by 5 Points</p>
<p>—New Silkworms Have Arrived Again with Over 600 Bags—</p>
<p>Yesterday's market fire car bean market was exceptionally pretty, and the United City sold 18-19 cars, and the manufacturers did not dislike the big price. The purchasing stomach was very healthy, and occasionally, export groups asked about it. The market price soared by 5 points. In short, the arrival and storage were scarce, and people's hearts were tense. Yesterday, the Guangji wheel transported 631 bags of Wenzhou new broad beans, and the quality of the goods was different. The highest quality of 135 bags of the large grains was opened at a price of 5 yuan</p>

<p>Free Talk Re-examining the Fate of Scholars Da Sheng</p>
<p>In recent days, many friends who wield pens have been lamenting the misery of intellectuals, especially Master Qulu, who recounted the experiences of intellectuals from the Southern Song Dynasty to the Ming and Qing Dynasties in an article titled "The Fate of Scholars," ending with a sigh of "Alas," which makes people sigh endlessly.</p>
<p>In fact, the unfortunate fate of scholars is not unique to China; it is a universal lament throughout the ages. Recently, reading Pokrovsky's History of Russia, it mentions that during the reign of Nicholas I, the lectures and writings of scholars were monitored extremely strictly. Each lecture had to be "officially approved," otherwise it would be considered "revolutionary." As for published manuscripts, they had to undergo extremely rigorous inspection. Due to such severe oppression, writers could only express their opinions through allegories, so that people could vaguely see what was being referred to between the lines. For example, if someone wanted to criticize Bruck, the then Minister of Finance of Russia, they could only use Bruck, the Minister of Finance of Austria, as an analogy. Similarly, no one dared to write articles advocating the emancipation of serfs, and even the term "serfdom" could only be called "obligatory tax" or even "natural force." Terms such as "progress" were also forbidden because they symbolized revolution. The novelist Dostoevsky was exiled to Siberia, and the poet Shevchenko was exiled to the frontier and forbidden to use writing instruments. These were the experiences of intellectuals during the reign of Nicholas I in Russia.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just one example picked at random. There are countless others that were even more cruel and poisonous than the era of Nicholas I. However, if intellectuals are willing to write court poems or compose Qingping music, or if they are willing to establish court etiquette for Emperor Gao of Han, like Shusun Tong, then "all the officials in the court are noble scholars" and "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior." Wealth and fame are readily available, and intellectuals are not born to suffer misfortune. Therefore, "misfortune" and "good fortune" are both choices made by intellectuals themselves, as the saying goes, "There is no door for misfortune or fortune, only people invite it themselves." However, if intellectuals really never talk about "natural forces" or "evolution," then Russia might still be stuck in the era of Nicholas I. Also, if burning books and burying scholars could really imprison people's thoughts and will, then the world might still belong to the direct descendants of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. Russia finally "evolved," and Qin Shi Huang's world finally only lasted for two generations. Therefore, some intellectuals are willing to suffer misfortune and cruelty.</p>
<p>I myself am just someone who can wield a pen. Looking back on the past and thinking about my own future, I can only let out a bitter smile. Tomorrow Peng Jiahuan</p>
<p>In the evening, I walked hesitantly on Lafayette Road, with a book in my hand and two dimes of wealth in my pocket. A serious problem, even more serious than "national crisis," could not be resolved by either war or peace. "Forget about it, I can't. Let's bet everything, but what about tomorrow?..."</p>
<p>As if driven by ghosts, I finally walked into the dumpling shop. For the sake of tomorrow, I had originally decided to adopt a "just five" policy, but who knew I would blurt out "ten." I had to admit my bad luck and decided to leave after eating. Damn it, seven out of ten dumplings were gone, and another twisted thought came to mind: "Is there anything else?" "Yes, beef noodles, 24 cents." "Bring me a bowl." A foreigner came in front of the door, wearing a felt hat,</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Merit and Virtue Were Perfectly Fulfilled</h3>
<p>Six Newspaper Ministries' Football (Written by Wang Jianming)</p>
<p>The Morning Post scored the most points, ranking first. The Times News had excellent spirit and fought to the end.</p>
<h3>The Shenbao Ranked Third, With Three Wins, One Draw, and One Loss</h3>
<p>That a gentleman can have the courage and organize a football team is truly a rare marvel in history. That a football team can compete without quarreling, fighting, or forfeiting, attending every match, being enthusiastic in victory, not discouraged in defeat, and even more not arrogant in victory, is even more of a rare marvel in history. With a beginning and an end, yesterday the closing ceremony was held amidst laughter and jokes, with much left unsaid. I sincerely hope that the number of teams will increase in the next session. The Elder’s football skills, like Meng Jin’s, overwhelmed the Donghua team and defeated the Western Police, practicing the principle of "what is said can be done," and unleashing unprecedented glory in the press. This is all I have to say; let us wait and see what the future holds.</p>
<h3>The Morning Post Wins the Championship—</h3>
<p>Yesterday's victory over the Times News</p>
<h3>The Morning Post Has Great Momentum</h3>
<p>Before the match, the audience all expected the Times News to lose, even if not by a large margin, it would be difficult to escape at least six goals. This was because the Times News’ goalkeeper, Zhang Shengzhi, and the five tiger generals including Shao Yi, had all gone to Hangzhou for the All-Zhejiang Games. Besides the four knights, Teng Shugu, Jiang Zongdao, Li Gengxi, and Wang Mengnian, the skills of the other players were mediocre. Naturally, they were no match for the Morning Post. However, they all held the idea of sacrificing themselves to defend their country. Even under the pressure of superior equipment, they swore to resist to the death, without the slightest discouragement or disorder. Jiang Zongdao was even more of a mainstay of the entire team.</p>
<h3>Qu Yue Scores Two Goals Alone</h3>
<p>Qu Yue is the main player of the Morning Post, his movements are agile. From afar, he looks like a crane towering above a flock of chickens. The Times News' defense constantly saw his footprints. After seven minutes, he dribbled into the penalty area and shot diagonally into the goal. After the kickoff and resumption of the game, the Times News' situation became increasingly dangerous. The two great generals, Wang and Li, blocked left and right, but could not keep up. With a slight lapse in concentration, Lao Qu advanced to fifteen yards and with a resounding kick, the ball went into the net. At this point, the Times News had lost the second goal.</p>
