<p>— 明</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福。於本月十六日向世界五十四國元首提議保障世界和平。重伸非戰公約之精義。其内容要約言之。可分爲以下三點。第一。對設置軍備無論爲防守爲侵略。皆暗示嚴重之針貶。幷主張廢止侵略武器。第二。爲說明某一國之侵略行爲。即足以擾亂世界和平。故「簽約各國須能忠實履行其義務。應各自承認。不派遣任何性質之武裝軍隊。越出本國國境。」第三。更聲明「任何國家如不以眞實誠意出而參加。致將軍備增加。致將軍備增加至於和平條約所規定以外使和平終至於無成。…則世界文明各國。將必知失敗責任之所在。」此種提議。洵爲當今對症之藥石。爲從事於軍備擴張武力侵略者之當頭棒喝也。</p>
<p>其所以在世界經濟會開會之前美國金融恐慌初告段落之後。發爲如此轟動全球之宣言。在歷史上又似背乎美國從來之傳統主張。（抛棄門羅主義）進而提倡國際軍備縮小。國際經濟協作。且與美國未嘗恢復尋常國交之蘇聯中央執行委員會主席加里寗通函。匪特衝破歷史上之傳統。且亦捨棄一時感情支配。而圖謀國際間之和平。是所以値得當世各國所稱誦者也。蓋北美合衆國總統。鑒於世界情勢之緊迫。戰爭危機之顯露。而經濟恐慌。以政治危機之深化而同其深刻。因此市塲爲之愈變愈窄狹。國際間交換。益加縮小。於是失業者增加。人心不安。社會遂動盪不寗。此誠由於資本主義内在的矛盾演變而來。致富者「財高北斗。」而貧者「窮無立錐。」一般大衆購買力衰落。國内國外。同一景象。然而就表面上觀察。殊不如是。資本主義自身。似尙有發展之餘地。設使當世各國眞能協力一致。共圖世界經濟復興之道者。則前途不能謂爲絕對無望。不過在歐洲資本主義各國中。德法國仇。牢不可解。前者堅持廢棄凡爾賽和約。力主軍備平等。後者不忘其國家之「安全保障。」故盡力以維持凡爾賽和平條約。加以意大利旣虎視南歐。又欲獨霸地中海。乃結聯德·奥·匈中國。以法西斯蒂狹隘的國家主義相號召。使歐洲更增不安。經濟恐慌之解脫。將愈無望。故美國總統不惜犧牲其「門羅主義。」而提倡世界軍備縮小。以消除政治的危機。而謀國際經濟上之通力合作。其苦心誠不可没也。</p>
<p>然而遠處東方之日本軍國主義者。旣未根本認識經濟恐慌之内在的必然性。反以軍需工業之非生産的需要。以刺激一般産業。利用通貨膨脹政策。勉强保持一般經濟在數字上之繁榮。是以不顧國際信義。蹂躪「非戰公約。」及其他一切國際條約。假名自衛。擅自侵入我國東北四省。且以軍力製造俾儡。託名民族自决。而實行其武力侵略。今更肆其鐵蹄。渡灤河。越長城。而窺取平津。侵擾華北。更欲造成其第二僞組織。匪特名義上破壞國際和平。且將實際上攫取列國在華北利益而肆行獨占。故日本軍國主義者。獨外於世界各國。謂美國之和平提議。祇適用於歐洲。不適用於東亞。且以特殊情形作詭辯。仍繼續其武力侵略。然則美總統之和平保障宣言。軍縮提議。幾何而不爲日軍所破碎耶。</p>
<p>吾人於此。固深知權不均等者。不足以言和。力不均等者不足以持平。美國之於歐洲。其權其力。皆勉可互相均等者也。故和平有商議之餘地。其於遠東。將有如何把握耶。吾人對羅斯福氏之和平宣言及縮减軍備之申請。固深表同情。然又慮其成功之不易也。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　今日白宮與國務院俱集中注意於華北時局冀有所發展、或能有助於世界不侵略公約之實現、蓋軍縮會議之氣象、現旣有顯著之進步、國務院逆料對於此約、唯日本最易提出保留、據國務院所接非正式而可靠消息、日本非俟其在滿地位能按照國際法認爲合法後、將難接受此議、又據平津消息、此時頗有休戰之可能、如能休戰則日兵將撤回滿洲、中日兩軍間劃出中立地帶、果爾或能使日本無條件接受不侵略公約、故白宮與國務院俱注意華北時局之發展也、又聞國務院擬使此約在世界經濟會議開幕前成立、但滿洲與南美之戰事、均爲大障礙、深恐非俟華北傳聞中之休戰解决日軍開出南滿鐵路附屬地問題後、羅斯福總統所提條件、終難完全達到、至南美方面則巴拉圭與玻里維亞·秘魯與哥侖比亞·此時猶無復電、亦未表示任何意見、至歐洲方面自德總理希特勒聲稱、德國將締結不侵略條約、並保證勿强行破壞現行條約後、此間信軍縮危機業已化除、再法國聞希特勒措辭比較和緩和釋重負消息、亦令此間認爲有希望之現象、頃據官塲消息、美總統之願望在締結一絕無絲毫保留之世界公約、因覺一有保留、將失其籲請之本意、惟因有日本爲梗、此事恐殊不易辦到云、（十七日國民社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　法國全國晨報對於羅斯福總統公佈之軍備計劃、均採取極冷靜審愼之態度、極右派報紙則竟已决然表示拒絕之意、造成此種消極態度最大之原因、大槪爲（一）羅氏對於戰債問題、並未提及、（二）宣言未曾與法國以充份之保障、俾得免除國外之侵略、（三）宣言並未對於侵略國家提出適當裁制之方法、故法國著名公法家白萊斯氏曾於巴黎日報發表一論文稱、羅氏宣言中最重要之一部份、爲羅氏宣稱美國願與他國合作、對於擾亂和平之國家加以處分、所可惜者羅總統並未將美國與他國如何合作之方法、加以更詳盡之說明也、白萊斯氏復謂羅斯福氏之宣言、竟未提及裁制一事、或者美總統不願以此重任加諸參院之身、依事實而論、法國實不能不先要求盡量之减縮軍備、然後始能有安全之感覺也云云、巴黎迴聲報之波廷那氏對於美國之軍縮計畫、竟貿然加以駁斥、據稱美國之政策爲無知無識不加思索之方箴、蓋侵略之軍備即使可以廢除、但戰爭仍可隨時發生、實因今日之大患、爲條約巳不復爲人重視、儘可任意撕毁之也、而法國之軍隊、實爲維持現行條約之最大勢力、使因軍縮會議之故而不得不減縮、則各條約將愈見其速毁矣云云、（十七日路透社電）</p>

<p>（東京通信）蘇俄外交人民委員長李維諾夫對日本正式提議　之中東路出售問題、日政府因此問題頗重要、現在愼重研究中、本問題最緊要點爲其價格及付欵問題、日俄兩當局尙未正式表示任何意見、然然方主張其賣價爲三萬萬金留布、日方因該鐵路最近已政治及經濟意義之重要性、擬以八千萬元買收、現在兩方之主張大有懸殊、至於其付欵方法、日方考慮者有三、即（一）將中東路改爲股份組織、由蘇俄所有其股份、（二）買價一部以長期支票繳付、（三）買價一部以現金支付、</p>
<p>駐日法國大使瑪鐵爾於本月八日正午訪問外務省有田次官、詢問蘇俄對日提議出售中東路是否事實、法國與俄國銀行有債權關係故關心此問題、法使又聽取日政府對於俄日「滿」三國共同委員會設立問題之態度及方針、有田次官回答謂蘇俄外交人民委員長李維諾夫確有提議出售中東路問題、至於設立三國共同委員會問題、日本希望其早時成立、據聞法使主張法國與中東路有重大利害關係之理由如次、俄國帝制時代建設中東路、當時擬與清國政府訂立「關於中東路建設及經營中合同」然因經清國政府拒絕、俄政府之俄清銀行爲表面上之當事人、於一八九五年二月十日、投資本金六百萬羅布、建設中東路、而此資本金爲當時巴黎銀行團之所出者、自此以後、法政府每於中東路發生問題時、主張與其有利害關係云、然俄清銀行六百萬羅布之中、僅付五百萬留布、中東路其後自己發行公債、而賄取三萬五千萬留布之巨大經費、據日方觀察、中東路因不如普通鐵路借欵、未爲對於該銀行之擔保品、故日本與蘇俄之間進行賣買交涉、法國無干涉此問題之法律的根基、（日聯社）</p>

<h3 id="c46">軍縮形勢大澄清 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>歐　美　各　國　如　釋　重　負</p>
<p>軍　縮　總　會　今　日　再　開</p>
<p>四强公約障碍亦已清除</p>
<p>（柏林）　德國會於總理希特勒演說後、致通過决議案、宣布國會鑒於平等問題至關德國之生命、願於此事一致爲政府之後盾、此可證德國人民贊助希特勒平等主張之熱烈、柏林及全國視希特勒之演說、爲致全世界之和平文、因其中已說明德國無侵略意志、不欲强求修正疆界、及他國如願亦如德國所爲、則德國準備實行軍縮也、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　據白宮消息、羅斯福總統聽德總理希特勒廣播演說後、尙覺愉快、因希氏贊成其謀取和平之運動也、白宮方面表示意見、以爲現有樂觀理由、羅斯福總統禁止侵略行爲之主張、可望成功、美總統廢除攻擊的戰具之提議、及其贊成英相軍縮計畫之原則、已爲德總理所贊同、國務院對於此點、至爲重視、德總理之論調可視爲溫作、便人興奮、此皆爲日内瓦進行之良好象徴、希特勒所稱德國欲他國解除軍備、而非欲自已重治軍備一說、國務院視爲最關重要、可見德國欲以和平方法、而非以暴力謀取凡爾賽和約之若干修正也、至於德總理所發他國苟以不平等壓力施諸德國、則德國將被迫退出國聯之警告、衆信希氏演詞中所表示之一般溫和態度、當可使時局不致達於决裂之點、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　德總理希特勒之演說、已引起一般良好之印象、巴黎政界承認其語氣和緩、而謂希特勒顯圖取悅羅斯福總統·麥唐納與墨索里尼、巴黎人士以爲希特勒已覺悟羅斯福之暗示、故願化叱咤爲委婉、但法德兩國間關於軍縮之罅隙、仍闊大如前云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　德國衆議院投票贊成希特勒演說時、該院民主社會當議員團、亦嘗參加、本日法國衆議院休息室中評論此事、社會黨首領勃魯姆　對本社記者宣言如下、「予對此事可爲君等說明者有二、第一德國衆議院此次開會時、民主社會黨議員參加者爲數有限、第　即該黨議員參加投票之舉、旣與該黨志願相反、又與該黨幹部對該黨在柏林各議所發員之訓令不合」、勃魯姆對德國民主社會黨議員參加投票一舉、所能發生之結果、亦有所宣言、略云、「予對此層、僅能以極保留態度、說明予之意見、但德國民主社會黨幹部及一大部分黨員　意見紛岐、事實上可謂等於分裂」、記者叩以法國社會黨對此事之意見、勃魯姆答稱、「吾人感想已爲一般人所知曉、吾人以爲對於希特勒獨裁政治之唯一辦法、只在奮鬥到底、社會黨份子對於希特勒政治、有認爲應採妥協態度、或取被動之忍受態度者、吾人對於此種黨員、不當與之合作」云、</p>
<p>（巴黎）　據本社代表向主管方面調查所得、德國總理希特勒昨日發表之演說、一般人對之雖持保留態度、然亦不存惡意、衆人所特别注意者約有兩事、一爲希特勒演說中不主張使用强力之一段、一爲希氏允許德國、絕不故意破壞現行各種條約、又由希氏演說中某某數段口氣觀之、似希氏已似將改變方針、並自認其政策中若干種方式爲不當云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　羅馬人士皆歡迎希特勒之演說、稱爲和緩而合理之文、衆意希氏之言論、可袪除英國對國家社會黨政策好意　之疑懼、希氏之願接受墨索里尼提出之四强公約、及願簽定互不侵犯協定、皆可打銷德國對其東陲　有侵略意志之流言云、德大使署邇來常與意外交部接觸、非政界之意見、以爲希氏演說之和緩、或由此故、總之、衆覺墨索里尼四强公約之障碍今已清除、可望實現云（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦泰晤士報今日評論德總理希特勒昨在國會發表之演說、謂希氏所具之政治手腕、世界於其演說中可見其一斑、細繹其詞、似德國準備在日内瓦對於廢除久役國防軍之問題、作更近情理之談判云、泰晤士報此種言論、英國他報亦有之、皆認希氏演說溫和誠摯、造成較好空氣、惟以明日德代表那杜尼在軍縮會之態度方爲德國軍縮政策之眞正試騐、英政府方面覺世人現所注目之日内瓦、將因希氏演詞而有切實進步之可能、倫敦金融市場亦因希氏演詞而减少惶擾、同時垣街價格漲起、雖不乏獲利之了結、收盤終形堅穩、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3 id="c47">「侵略國」界說决定 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　德總理希特勒保證德國勿强行破壞現行條約、並宣稱準備贊同不侵略公約後、今日日内瓦方面如釋重負、軍縮會議總委員會雖將展期至星期五開會、以便研究希氏演說、安全委員會已於最後會議、採用蘇俄所提侵略國界說、其内容大致與美總統之不派兵出境方式相脗合、撮要如下、</p>
<p>（一）向他國宣戰者</p>
<p>（二）不宣戰而侵入他國領土者</p>
<p>（三）用海軍封鎖他國者</p>
<p>（四）以任何方式轟炸鄰國領土者</p>
<p>（五）在他國領土派兵登岸或駐紮陸軍海軍或空軍者</p>
<p>巴黎消息、法人聞希特勒演說不若預料之激烈、爲之大慰、美代表台維斯不日將在軍縮會議詳細申說美總統提議、並聲明美國願訂諮商公約及贊同監督軍備云（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　希特勒之演說已引起此間一般美滿的印象、認爲措詞巧妙、尤足動盎格魯撒克遜民族之聽聞、衆意希氏已表示渠不愧爲政治家、但日内瓦軍縮專家則予以極嚴峻之批評、謂德總理之言、與軍縮會德代表那杜尼所持之理論、無甚出入云、軍縮會議之總委員會原定星期四日集議、今改至星期五日午後、屆時德代表那杜尼與法代表彭古皆可抵此、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　自希特勒總理在國會中之演說發表後、柏林各種報紙均長篇登載、幷有評論一致加以擁護、波爾森報稱希氏爲解除世界不信任起見、已不惜將國家社會黨之各種組織、一律置諸國際共管之中、惟各國同等之組織、亦應如此歸諸國際共管、實在必有之條件、該報稱此種讓步、實較多時間之口頭辯論爲重要、幷可將多年盛傳之德國秘密計劃之說打銷、如撥雲霧而見天日也、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>部員大事更動</p>
<p>白鳥調駐瑞典</p>
<p>谷任僞國參議</p>
<p>▲華聯十八日東京電　日外交部將調動部内主要人員、聞武者小路公使將任土耳其大使、情報部部長白鳥敏夫繼任瑞典公使、情報部長將由天羽參贊或栗栖通商局長調任、此項調動、定在下星期二之定期閣議决定、白鳥昇任原因、在九一八事變後與軍部切實合作、倡對華强硬外交有功、受軍部推挽之結果云、</p>
<p>▲電通社十八日東京電　有田次官之辭職、因與白鳥情報部長對立而尖銳化、故白鳥之轉任、可謂兩敗俱傷、且含有刷新外交之意味、其他谷亞細亞局長有被任爲（僞）國參議之說、而外務省之異動、其範圍似相當較廣、又内田外相謂、此事並無轉換何等外交方針之意云、</p>

<p>▲電通社十八日東京電　對五一五事件民間被告之第一公判、决定九月上旬開庭、犯罪内容、與血盟團事件同一種類、故審理亦與血盟團事件同樣、仍由酒卷裁判長與木内檢事担任、一面海軍被告、在橫須賀軍法會議、開庭公判、其第一次若照預定在大演習後之七月下旬或八月上旬、裁判官由大角海相任命判士五名任之、律師各被告以二名爲限、希望辯護之律師甚多、又陸軍方面如審理順利進行、八月下旬可開第一次公判、裁判官由林第一師團長、任命判士五名搆成之、</p>

<p>▲國民十七日華盛頓電　澈查阿克朗飛船失事報告、今日發表、據稱失事原因、由於判斷錯誤與誤命令所致、未曾查見缺點、該船司令麥郭特定向不善、致飛船駛入風雨中心、爲下吹之狂風所吹墜、但因氣象圖不完善、致判斷難其準確、再麥氏下令變更方向十五度、乃被誤會爲五十度、遂致駛入飛船曾欲繞避之雷電中、亦失事一大原因、現參議員對此報告、認爲尙有許多參院特别注意之問題未經調查、或將在休會前另組委員會查詢此案、今日有參議員數人指戰鬥艦隊之司令迫令最優之航空專家隨艦出發、而以較少經騐者掌管飛船、實爲失事根本原因、設令羅森台爾中校統率該船、當不致有錯誤之判斷云、</p>

<h3 id="c105">國際電台與馬凱公司通報 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>定於今日開始中美間增闢一組線路</p>
<p>國民新聞社云、交通部國際電台與馬凱無線電報公司通報事宜、曾經籌備有日、茲聞雙方已約定於今日開始通報、從茲世界通信網中、又新加一組新線路、使中國與世界各國間、愈趨接近、消息日益靈通、而値茲世界各國、對於遠東事件、羣相注目之際、適爲新線路開始通報之時、尤足引人尋味也、查交通部與馬凱公司所訂服務合同、係藉部屬現有國際各電台、與該公司之舊金山各電台、互通報務、該公司爲國際電話電報公司之一部份、而國際電話電報公司、則在世界各區、無論有線電之電報電話、大都設有經營管理之機關、其最著者、爲馬凱無線電報公司、爲專營歐美間報務之大西洋商務水電公司爲專營北美南美西印度間之全美電報公司、以及郵務電報公司、</p>
<p>考馬凱公司成立之歷史、當溯自一千九百十年、當時爲與陸地有綫電競爭業務計、始有無綫電報之創設、經營其業者、爲美國聯邦無線電報公司、當時於美國各大城鎭、皆有電台之設立、嗣後因美國政府之限制、僅允其於太平洋沿海、作商務之通報、而該公司著名之定向電台、適於此時成立、至一千九百十七年、美政府因加入歐戰、曾將該公司之各台、暫時收歸國有、而該公司爲維持其業務計、只得藉有線電傳遞其報務、但因有線電之效率、遠遜於無線電、故歐戰告終後、至一千九百二十年、該公司仍從事於無線電台之建設、從此業務亦日形發展、至爲郵務電報公司所注目、同年十月、郵務電報公司之總理馬凱君、遂設法將該公司之無線電部分購買、而馬凱無線電報公司、遂於斯時成立矣、自茲以後、馬凱公司、即開始於舊金山建設其國際大電台、以與檀香山菲列賓各處通報、而超越太平洋通報之各電台、亦於是時告成、迨至一千九百二十九年、馬凱公司復與國際電話電報公司相合併、自歸國際公司經營後、馬凱公司之業務、更形蒸蒸日上、其始也不過能於太平洋沿岸、作定向之通報、而發展至今、則歐美間有橫越大西洋直通歐洲之電路、南美間則有通達古巴秘魯阿根庭苛崙布及西印度各區之電路、太平洋方面、則有舊金山檀香山菲利賓之各電臺、茲則復由交通部與該公司開始通報、而太平洋間又增闢一新電路矣、由上海發至東美之電報、可由舊金山傳達紐約、而發至南美各區之電報、亦可由紐約轉遞、倘將來中美間報務發達、由上海至紐約另闢直通電路、亦自易爲力、馬凱公司與郵務電報公司、　雖係另一組織、但於收發報務上、則係共同經營、郵務電報公司、在美國通報機關、多至七萬所、　兩公司同在國際電話電報公司管理之下、故凡收發報務、旣無須借用他家路線、於傳遞上自較迅速也、</p>
<p>就中國方面言之、則與馬凱公司之通報、不徒增進國家之收入、而增闢一組線路、旣可增進國際間之交通、並可防杜他家公司之壟斷、爲益實多云、</p>

<p>日方表示希望實現</p>
<p>新聲社云、昨日本埠字林西報載、北方中日軍事問題、已進行解决、於兩種條件之下、即（一）雙方諒解、華軍留駐於灤河以南、則日軍撤退至長城之外、（二）不勗勵幷不供給義勇軍、以擾亂「滿洲國」、日使館發言人、昨向往訪之新聲社記者、談話時、曾表示否認、但認爲此項條件、可爲日軍部所滿意接受者、但其妥協恐未必有如此之迅速耳、蓋以中日雙方之態度、現均頗强硬、不易使其意見漸趨一致也、但深信雙方或可於此項條件之下、趨於妥協、然在另一方面言之、新任華北政務整理委員會委員長黄郛氏、對妥協事業已加以否認、且黄氏幷曾宣示决不簽定任何協定、而日本軍人、又有主張態度極端强硬者、黄氏雖爲洞悉日本國情、與夫與日本有相當之良好感情之人、但在此種情形之下、妥協之說、似屬渺茫、惟就現實情事而論、北方略有轉機情形、自黄氏到平後、均黄氏所謂將在相互諒解下、謀一暫時和平辦法、想見變相妥協之實現、只在實現時間之遲早問題矣、</p>

<h3 id="c190">章乃器先生講中日關係前途之我見 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>五月十二日在青年會講</p>
<p>我們無論研究社會的一切任何問題，總脫離不開去考究他的因果關係。知道他已往的原因，然後能推想到他將來的結果。研究中日問題也是一樣。現在我先把日本方面來說：</p>
<p>第一，我們現在不是常常說要考察一國的國民性嗎？一國的國民性，是没有好壞的，他只有被環境支配的結果。日本國民性所以强硬，是他們的國土所賜予的！區區的四個島！本州·四國·九州·蝦夷，面積不過三十八萬方粁（二萬三千餘方里）。明治維新以後，西方的文化傳入、更增强他向外掠奪的武器，開始向附近的弱小民族用全力進攻。</p>
<p>從一八七四年（同治十三年）起侵入台灣，隨後滅琉球改爲冲繩縣；一八九五年（光緒二十一年）中日之戰，我國失敗，日本實行割取台灣及澎湖羣島；一九零四年日俄戰爭後，日本又勝利，佔領遼車半島，設置關東州；不久又減朝鮮；以至二十一條；上海事件；濟南慘案；以至最近的九一八，一二八，都是連續一貫的侵略史。他們看準了路線，北進南進，步伐一些也不亂。</p>
<p>九一八事變的原因，是世界經濟恐慌，由經濟恐慌産生不景氣；不景氣現象瀰漫全球。資本主義之致命傷，尤在生産過剩；生産過剩則物價低落，失業增加，社會不安寗；這是自然的趨勢。日本當然難逃其例。國内思想界有左右傾騷動，社會不安寗，日政府就發動進攻瀋陽。使經濟上可佔取全部或一部滿洲，以爲資源；政治上可移國人目光向外，來緩和自身的矛盾。這種結果使日人由遼寗而吉林而黑龍江而熱河，最近更有進窺平津之圖！</p>
<p>但是又要說我們自己不好。九一八事變之前，日人有意無意的暗示，如朝鮮總督及滿鐵總督的更掉，萬寳山案，朝鮮華僑慘殺案，都有點「山雨欲來風滿樓」之象，而我們的政府爲什麽不覺得？都因爲在專心致志做他們的「安内」工作的緣故！</p>
<p>現在我們來談談我們爲什麽不抵抗的原因。一·我國財政來源，以關稅·烟稅·爲大宗，而其基礎則建築在通商口岸上。若一旦宣戰，通商口岸有被封鎖之虞。而財政來源爲之斷絕。那末我們爲要苟延殘喘，只有俯首待戮了。</p>
<p>二·現時代爲殖民地反帝運動時代，反帝運動力量是很偉大的，道在某種意義上、足以使我國外交政策變更爲無抵抗主義。</p>
<p>那末我們今後出路在那裏？</p>
<p>現在我們的出路只有一個「拚」字，此外再無旁一條路行得通。我主張拚的理由是：（一）與敵宣戰，必能引起國内目光一致向外，不再自相殘殺；（二）與日宣戰是適應時代。我們知道，現時代是爲殖民地反帝時代，而這反帝的陣營，我國也是其中職員之一，我國因之也就不能逃避其責任，應該迎頭趕上去！</p>
<p>更就敵方言之，此次日人之侵入，使農村經濟破壞，愈益高速度進行；社會經濟組織，崩潰愈益澈底，也就是中國革命客觀條件愈益成熟，迫切得中國不得不被推動走上革命的一途。此時若有人敢反時代出而主妥協，則必成爲革命的對象，丨革命的羣衆，當爲百分之八五之工農；不願再在寄生蟲下討生活，也是環境驅使着他們踏上反帝先鋒的路，他們委實是被剥削得够了，他們不自出來推翻他們的壓迫者，他們永得不着光明。</p>
<p>然而我國革命運動若發動，必不爲各國際資本帝國主義者所願聞。他們所希望的，「一動也不要動」，任其宰割。血盡而後吸髓！我國若革命，必不蒙他們青睞。我國建設，我國行社會主義，國家主義，俱非彼等之福，他們的目的是在呌我們和他們妥協以維持和平，保護市塲，但我們要爲自己延生命，我們只有和他們立在勢不兩立的地位。</p>
<p>那末我們假使和日本開戰，勝利有無把握呢？</p>
<p>從歷史方面看來，目下正是資本帝國主義掙扎末期的最後反響時代。但無論牠如何掙扎。結果必趨於崩潰，那是一定的。在這一點上，我們抗日是有把握的。</p>
<p>我們看這次日本對我侵略，他的目的有二：第一推銷其過剩商品，移對内矛盾對外。</p>
<p>但這第一目的，日本有無達到呢？我們看去年日本對外貿易，比前减少百分之三十五，？原則上去年日元貶價，其貿易輸出額應加增，今反趨下流，可見其欲推銷過剩商品，是徒勞而無功；更就日本社會現狀觀，思想上依舊絕端左右傾；秩序亦未見安寗，可見他的要移對内矛盾對外也是歸於空想。第二，日本想以滿洲爲資源，自給自足，以抵抗國際資本帝國主義過剩商品之侵佔。然而目下的經濟恐慌是世界整個的經濟衰落，而其致命傷則在資本主義本身矛盾，生産過剩。日本想在整個世界經濟恐慌下，以滿洲資源單獨解除其困難，事實上是否可能呢？而且日本攫滿洲後，事實上只有增加其内部之矛盾與經濟之紊亂。所以，我的結論是：第一，我國若發動整個民族革命，必能對國際資本主義至少是帝國主義給以一個重大的震驚，引起全世界被壓迫民族共同奮鬭，否則如與日妥協，只有坐以待斃。第二，我國整個民族革命之發動，已刻不容緩，若再坐延歲月，必至爲人瓜分豆剖而後已。（葉文雄記）</p>

<p>— 百合</p>
<p>西北風絕迹久矣，杏花春雨，也給文人雅士送春送掉了。這幾天表示炎凉，的寒暑表，已由四十餘，五十餘，六十餘，升到七十餘及，雖然「熱死碼頭小工」，「黄包車夫中暑」的消息，報上尙未披露，狗嘴裏舌頭，尙未掛出來，但是荷囒水已經上市，冰淇淋已經暢銷，自相人已敞開了對襟褂，勞働者已裸露着上體，一切都已表示着熱得裏個來。</p>
<p>在大冷天，不錯，勸人「熱心××」，「熱心××」，的確有消寒逭冷之功，但是天熱了、再要勸人「熱心××」，「熱心××」，未免不識相，所以「風凉話，」活該走運。</p>
<p>亡國怕甚麽。猶太亡國一千多年了，猶太人多麽出風頭。波蘭不也亡過麽？你瞧，現在不是又很好了？印度呢，蕭伯訥都主張許其獨立啦、高麗人更是了不得，革命革得日本人手忙脚亂。咱中國丢了東三省，饒上熱河，老閶本錢大，滿不在乎。卽使日本鐵騎由平津踏到黄河，跨過長江，直奔珠江，亡了整個中國，難道眞會「一個日本人，監視一個中國人」麽？　卽使中國亡了，不革命，亡定了那麽，也不用着急，世上亡國奴正多着呢，也不光是我們中國人。况且，日本遲早總不免大地震，東京將沈海底，民衆都會自殺盡。就是不這麽，到本年年底，東北也該給咱收回了。退一百步言，今年年底收不回，十年之内，日本必起革命，自動放棄東北。其實，這些都是廢話，中國怎麽會亡，共匪已勢窮力蹙，不久便要一致對外，依着一貫的預定方針，收復失地囉。</p>
<p>咱們老百姓，捐錢買飛機之外，儘可搖着芭蕉扇，高枕而眠啦。</p>
<h3 id="c192">腿 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>腿在吃的食品裏，要算金華火腿的滋味，再好没有了！</p>
<p>腿的等級，在我們人類，有白晳的，有粗糙的，有長胖的，有矮削的，腿肚子揷在田裏工作，是農人的泥腿，長途賽跑的運動家，是長的一雙飛毛腿。</p>
<p>都市美與農村美，是絕對矛盾，是絕對不同的，農村美以泥腿爲可貴，都市美以舞女的雪白肌膚，滑嫩如脂的玉腿爲可愛。</p>
<p>光華燦爛的年紅燈，籠罩在色情狂的男子頭上，在這熱情的氛圍裏，男子的顆心。所以能被舞女縛住，完全被那玉腿所誘惑，腿的確是人身上一個神秘的片叚。</p>
<p>現在國難日亟，腿是給人們利用，不是給人們玩弄，但是中國人的腿，是軟弱的，是不得勁的，自從遇了著名矮腿子的日人，着着進佔我國土地以來，我們國人，只知很安閒慢步向後退，却不知向前進！那些矮腿子就很不客氣的跨進東三省，跨入熱河，又跨到長城以内，他們現在雖然仍想向前跨佔，我們國人，能聽他前進嗎？</p>
<p>今日欲挽回這種頽勢，打破這種惡環境，的確，仍然要待我們全國民衆，鼓起勇氣，將兩隻腿子拍上幾下，用我們的熱力與血，走向前方，與那些矮腿子，拚個你死我活，我想，日人雖然野蠻，必定經不起我們大刀的刴削，熱血的噴激，日皇終没有許多假腿子賜他的兵士，像賜野村一樣。</p>
<p>女人的玉腿，是麻醉人性靈的，是剥削人意志的，同胞，同胞，國難巳急了！你們快快猛醒吧！</p>
<h3 id="c193">絕食 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>我幼時讀敎科書，記得有「一日不食則饑，三日不食則疾，七日不食則死」那幾句，但不知首陽山上的伯夷昆仲，是否挨了不折不扣，不多不少，整整的七天饑荒。</p>
<p>自從那時候起，二三千年來，一直到近代，除了因荒年，圍城，吃官司等種種原因而由「饑」而「疾」由「疾」而「死」的絕食成功者，歷史上除了伯夷昆仲之外，似乎尙未有第三者加入。</p>
<p>印度國父甘地老先生，前遭曾因革命被拘而絕食，但是挨餓了六個七日以上，雖然「饑」「疾」都按步就班的成功了，但是功虧一簣，終於終止絕食，而回復了健康。</p>
<p>廿地之後，有一位牛蘭同志，也依樣葫蘆的玩那一套，但是由「饑」而「疾」，居然也挨過了應當「死」的期限，而放棄了絕食的壯舉，重新吃麵包，喝牛奶，度其特别優待的監獄生活。</p>
<p>說來也眞奇，怎麽甘地，牛蘭，竟能「七日不食而不死」？據說，其中也有原因。第一是因爲平常喝的是羊乳，牛乳，滋養得好，所以不死，並不是「命不該絕。」第二是絕食不絕水，這也是一個取巧之法。究竟古人没有現代人聰明，伯夷昆仲不知這門檻，「死」得有些寃</p>
<p>近來印度國父甘老先生，又大張旗鼓的絕食了。但據電訊所說，雖然仍舊是平素喝羊乳的甘地，雖然絕食之後，仍舊喝水，但是「一日不食」，已覺五臟廟唱空城計「三日不食」，已病得有些動彈不得了。待到此文發表時、或許已過了「七日不食」之限。但不知是否能按步就班，功德圓滿。</p>
<p>没飯吃的人，拼命的要尋飯吃，有地位，有飯吃的人，偏要絕食。甚麽道理？眞不懂丨</p>
<h3 id="c194">飛簷走壁的人物 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>山東韓主席爲「提倡國術」起見，特徴求「飛簷走壁點穴擊劍」的人材，並定奬勵辦法。於是引起社會人士的議論，有的視爲笑談，有的指爲不可理喻的迷信，和小孩子訪道求仙一樣。</p>
<p>記得在下在八九歲的當兒：約在清光緒末葉，那時先君秋坪公以進士分發江蘇，聽鼓吳門，任北路總巡差，往往有飛簷走壁的劇賊拿到。本領大的，不但輕身能飛，還能入水，躱在水中數小時，安然無恙，渾號呌做「水老鴉」。此輩身懷絕技，橫行省垣，犯案纍纍，又因緝捕不易，捕役等恨之刺骨，這時朱瞎子（竹垞）任臬憲，治盜匪很是嚴厲，凡捕獲水老鴉，多處極刑，眞好算是「草莽英雄」最不幸的時代了。</p>
<p>一夕，夜闌人靜，公館中的差役某甲，將要就寢。忽聞屋面上似有步履的聲音，亟喚了衆人起來，甲先上晒台察看。在下年雖幼稚，但爲好奇心所驅使，也隨之而上。突見一黑衣人隱身一隅，腰揷利刃，時月影橫斜，瞧了頗爲清晰。甲正欲上前捕拿，那黑衣人忽騰身一躍過河，（我們所居臨河）躱身在對面一家店舖屋上。一時人聲鼎沸，都用竹竿向空亂撩。黑衣盜忽又一躍入河，大家向河邊搜尋，却已水波不興，踪影毫無，擾攘了半夜，還幸未遭損失，衆人都嘖嘖稱奇。你想他忽而騰空如飛鳥，忽而入水如游魚，好像兩棲類的動物，這種水老鴉的本領，委實不小呢。現在追想起來，眞好似夢境。</p>
<p>這種飛簷走壁等人物，目下並非没有。不過若輩多淪爲盜賊，湮没不彰。所以歷來「飛簷走壁」四字，就是「江湖大盜」的名詞。現在魯主席當此國難危亟，飛機大砲聲裏。居然好整以暇，要聘請他們出來，待以上賓之禮，大約爲的是「武術救國」，或者也許是「保存國粹」的一法吧！</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第七回　數語絕恩情閉門痛哭　一肩擔道義酌酒商談</p>
<p>積之本來想笑出來，借着一笑，就可以溜走了。然而甘心太臉上，已經没有了笑容，怎好鬧什麽滑稽呢？只得退後了兩步，在對面椅子上坐下。甘太太噴着烟，又微笑了一笑。然後將兩個指頭揑着烟捲，用食指彈動烟捲上的灰，以便向痰盂子裏落去。望了積之的臉，似乎有一句很可考慮的話要問出來的樣子。積之雖然滿肚皮都罩着疑雲，然而在嫂嫂未說出什麽話來以前，他自然也不便作聲，嫂嫂的那一笑一看，眞是鬧得窘極了。甘太太很從容的道：你哥哥對我說，你和楊家老姑娘，已經訂婚了，這話是眞嗎？積之紅着臉道：没有這回事，甘太太正着臉色道：這話是眞的，我並非和你開玩笑。你覺得老姑娘不錯，你就和他訂婚得了。可是……說着一笑。在這可是兩個字之下，他把那句話忍耐下去了。積之也正色道：眞的没有這回事。甘太太道：你不要怪作大嫂子的，用話來嚇你，其實你没有和伊訂婚，那就很好，要不然，你哥哥會發脾氣的。你爲了那樣一個人來犧牲你的職業，那未免不値。像我們這種門第，像你這樣的資格，難道還找不到一個好媳婦？你别忙，準在半年之内，我和你找一位鮮花一樣的人兒。可是有一層，你必得和老姑娘斷絕了來往。積之望了地上，很躊躇的，低了聲音道：根本上我就和伊没有什麽來往。甘太太笑道：你又當面撒謊。你哥哥在乳茶舖裏遇到了你，你是約了人家，三年後再說呢，幹嗎約上這樣長的日子。積之明知無可抵賴，紅了臉說不出話來。甘太太道：你哥哥昨天回來，氣着話都懶說的，我問了許多遍，他才說明了，憑他的意思，就要下條子把你的事撤除了。我就勸他說，自己兄弟們，何必生什麽氣，有什麽話，當面說就是了。（七四）</p>

<p>— 張亦菴</p>
<p>三等電車的坐位也同洋房裏差不多一樣安適而洋化。在這車廂裏，一切都是洋式的，玻璃和窗扇的間隔，所採用的裝飾性質的線條圖案，整齊而經過機器製造的黄鋼配件，甚至張貼着的各色廣告，都不是内地鄕間所有，而且　外有繼續不斷的活動景致和各樣人物，五光十色的店舖櫃窗，一個初由内地出來的人坐在裏頭，眞有點飃瓢然了，何况又只花了七個或五個銅元呢！</p>
<p>近來見上海的報紙文字裏所用的詞語裏的字，有許多同原來的不同，雖然音相近（其實不是同音，只好說是相近）意義也相近，可是同原來的意義頗見出入了。例如：「稍爲」有作「稍微」，「利害」有作「厲害」，「聰明」作「聰敏」，「街談巷議」作「街談巷語」等等。不知是寫的人故意將它來改了以示新異，還是因爲一時想不起原來的字而姑且把聲音近似，意義可通的寫出來。</p>
<p>夢似乎比較事實來得更極端；如果是一個理知性質的夢，雖然很平常的事，在夢裏就會覺得非常嚴重；如果是一個感情性質的夢，多數是屬於悲哀的，雖然是很微細的觸動，也會使你大大的傷感，甚至使你哭得透不過氣來，雖然醒來並不曾發見流了多少眼淚，在夢中却已萬分哀慟了。（後來我發見了作這樣的夢時，十次有九次是給被頭悶住了口鼻，窒住了呼吸故有這樣的夢。）至於遇着盜匪猛獸，被人迫害以至於被殺而死等事，在夢中都已遍嘗過，而且不止一次了。</p>
<p>如果十年期間之内没有了青年人，所有的人只是幼年的或壯年以上的，那末戀愛的狀况不知會變成怎樣。</p>
<p>只要你肯嚷得聲音發啞，一定會有第一個人鼓起掌來，於是其餘的人也隨着鼓起來了。</p>
<p>在我所愛看的書裏頭，我喜歡它有點介紹其他書籍的廣告。這種廣告並不討厭，只要它所介紹的書同這本我正在愛看的書有相等的價値，相類的性質，但不要豋些，不相干的廣告就好。</p>
<p>過奢的慾望有如一個懸在太空的明月，雖然不能斷定說月亮是人類走不到的地方，但是如果有人能走得到的語，那總是一件非，常之事了。</p>
<p>京戲園象徴了全個中國社會，京戲是中國戲劇的結晶，京戲院的狀况是中國社會的結晶。只要京戲園裏的情况改變得好了一點，中國怕就不至於受人家侵略了。</p>
<p>可憐落了伍的紅角兒，現今只做了個不重要的前排戲的角色。</p>
<p>跑龍套眞無聊。</p>
<p>没精彩的戲也照例要排幾齣在前頭，因爲班子裏的老官要吃飯，其他的不重要的角色以至於跑龍套也一樣地要吃飯。</p>
<p>互戀有如着色的花草翎毛，濃紅翠綠，自然得人歡喜，單戀却如淡墨山水，雖然素樸，但是品質有時會比那着色的更高。</p>
<p>不成功的，不長期的戀愛有如一篇短篇小說：刹那間的，似戀愛而非戀愛的事件却似一段雜感，都各有耐人尋味的地方。</p>
<p>年齡會把你的幸福取消。</p>
<p>因爲是三十歲以上的人，說起關於戀愛的話來，覺得有點不好意思了。</p>
<p>有人說結過婚的人便不配談戀愛了，有了子女的人更不該談戀愛：有人說結婚同戀愛不是一件事，子女同戀愛更是没相干。</p>

<p>鐘鳴四下、雷雨方作、球塲已濕、晨時兩報戰士、會集營房之内、磨拳擦掌、準備厮殺、姚蘇鳳胸中按納不佳、高呼「比比」、衆擊應之、於是瞿越蔣宗道隊長、决議宣戰、率隊豋塲、裁判員張龍海、角聲一鳴、幾輩埋頭執筆之士、頓顯上馬殺敵之威、奈天不做美、黑雲四合、大雨如注、裁判員鴉笛收軍、越十分鐘、雲散雨止、戰士重復豋塲、而暴雨又降、乃雙方恊定、暫行休戰、改於二十六日下午四時、再决雌雄、</p>

<p>陣陣急雨、直至五時半始止、時事新報與民報戰士、均躍躍欲試、蔣湘青首先赤脚示威、餘子不甘落後、紛紛換衣脫鞋、一湧上塲、其勇敢之氣、直迫霄漢、</p>
<p>▲泥人蓮步　張龍海嚴重之宣戰令下、時事新方面首取攻勢、右翼聶世琦、得球傳中、赤脚大仙蔣湘青、射而不中、怒髮冲冠、奮勇相搏、水窪泥滑、留脚不住、趕個分明、嗣後雙方劈拍聲連、此起彼仆、臨時化裝爲泥人者、不知凡幾、卽隨在留意、幸免仆地者、其步步生蓮之姿、亦足令人捧腹、</p>
<p>▲吳東救駕　戰歷十分鐘、時事於干戈擾攘中、得罰任意球機會、計離敵門約十五碼、蔣湘青赤脚飛起、打個正着、民報守門員吳東、就勢接住、揮臂擲出、渡過難關、</p>
<p>▲時事連勝　但不轉瞬間、時事鐵騎、衝過二道防線、右翼聶世琦、挑球至中部、蔣湘青得球、站定脚跟、瞄準射發、球入網窠、紀錄乃開、移中再戰、陣脚未定、時事前軍又至民報腹地、由聶世琦蹴進一球、</p>
<p>▲民報不幸　嗣後幾番攘奪、民報頗有進展、正擬會　直搗、忽以觸手判罰、計其地點離門可二十五碼、蔣湘青再告奮勇、楊足踢去、吳東不慌不忙、二度保駕過關、詎一波未平、一波又起、時事新大小三軍、蠭湧而前、蔣湘青乘虛由斜角射球、吳東移步迎拒、滑脚倒地、遂又陷落一球、洵屬不幸、此上半時之戰况也、</p>
<p>▲門神滑倒　下半時雙方陣綫、微有變動、時事方面、蔣湘青退居守門、由夏開明上前衝鋒、民報方面之吳東、亦易任左翼、策動前綫、轉守爲攻、氣燄萬丈、說時遲、那時快、但見泥球飛起、直達時事新之網窠、蔣湘青接住、正待射發、而敵騎馳至、迴身巧避、立脚不穩、仰面倒地、半身入網、失却一球、</p>
<p>▲老仙解圍　移中再戰、時事前軍又乘機進攻、由左翼龔仲賢獲得一球、但民報隊抱百拆不回之志、陷蔣湘青於四面楚歌之境、賴老仙潘公弼單騎馳至、一脚解圍、</p>
<p>▲最後顔色　然民報隊之進攻、從此益急、幾度風雲變幻、終由右翼張箴、罰進一球、造成二對四之比數、民報雖負、實力亦未可忽視也</p>

<p>— 陸並謙記</p>
<p>（一）英國和法國　英國敎育　在戰後的變遷不多、本來英國的民族性　是重尙自由而不受限制的、我們只消看他們的法律都是不成文的、就是憲法也然、但是英國人都能刻意遵守、以爲遵守法律、並不是爲了法律、乃是應盡的義務、而且英國人喜守舊、對於任何事情、明知其不良、寗願他循序漸進的發展、不願用大刀闊斧去改革的、所以新思潮在英國是不接受的、這種情形、和美國不同、英國敎育没有系統他們的敎育部由私人去辦、各人隨着自己的意志做去、政府不加干涉、以致參差不齊、但是戰後、已能自知其誤、採用兩種方式來救濟這種弊病、一·實行會考辦法、去考查各校的成績、一班學校爲要保持他在社會上的地位、和信譽的、參加會考、於是無形中就可以就範起來了、二·規定補助制度、許多力量不足的學校、得享補助、要享補助、必先遵合政府頒行的條件、於是各校在無形中也可以一起來了、這種折衷調和的辦法、和英國的民族性是很適合的、至於大改革呢、歐戰初起時、曾有者、擬具敎育改革方案、想把學校澈底的改造、這種大改革、在英國民族性原是不很適合的、但是後來大戰方終、精神疲憊、大家明知他的不合、却也無力反對、因此就在國會通過、然而結果實行者、亦不過十分二三、他的原因、固然是經濟困難、但也因爲他們的素性、决不願以革命的手段來改革敎育的制度和方法的、敎育部見到這一點、故在一九二六年組織了許多委員會、如小學·中學·大學都有、根據民性、逐漸推進、所以英國的敎育在戰後的變遷不多、法國亦然、法國的敎育是有系統的、而且都由政府規定的、甚至某一個時間上某一種功課、其一節功課敎某幾頁書、都有規定、在戰爭以後、略爲改變了一下、各校的設施、可以自由活動、但是機會也很少、本年法國革命最早、但是階級觀念很深、上等階級與下等階級入學不同、上等階級可入預備學校、從中學而大學、下等階級祗能進普通學校、没有機會入中學大學的、所以他們的學校制度、可稱雙軌制、大戰以後一班有力者、主張加以改革、從事統一、祗須看各人的能力而定、</p>
<p>（二）新興國家　他們根本是没有敎育制度的、立國以後、努力於新制度的創造、但因財力不足、祗能以經濟的方法來嘗試、他們定下的計畫、是根據了地方人口的分佈情形而定的、先調查那一個地方人口最密、那一個地方人口最稀、村莊的人口和城市的人口分佈情形是怎樣、村莊和城市的距離有多遠、然後統計起來、决定那幾個地方、應該設立學校、所有學校附近十啟羅米突（約合十華里）地方的學齡兒童、都可入附近的學校這樣、學校不致重複、也不致缺乏、小學如此、中學也是如此、這種計畫、實在是很經濟的辦法、却也能收極大的效果</p>
<p>（三）德國和奥國　以前是專制國、敎育目標、不爲個人、祗爲帝制、大戰以後、政治方向變了、新敎育也隨之而興、所以新敎育法在德奥兩國、很容易見到、尤其是德國、新設的學校很多、我們談敎育、似乎非美國不可、實在德奥兩國的敎育方法和成績、很可佩效、</p>
<p>（四）俄國和意國　他們把敎育當作政治的工具、所以變遷也很大、</p>
<p>三、歐洲敎育趨勢　綜合歐洲各國敎育的最近趨勢、（一）戰前各國的敎育無大目標、戰後各國都見到民族衰弱、敎育失當、便决定了敎育政策、然後依照政策去做、政策内容、簡單的講、便是全民化、使得個個人都有享受敎育的機會、過去、法國敎育權很不平等、有的人往往受了限制、能力是可享的、都爲法律所不許、現在則所謂雙軌制多軌制、都打破了、正在那裏另闢途徑、（二）注重國防、歐洲各國實施敎育、極端的注重國防敎育、他們的敎材和敎法、都是如此、像本國的光榮史等等、都認爲很好的材料、使得各個兒童、都能明瞭在胸、尤其是新興國家、基礎未定、要使兒童具有愛國的思想和觀念、必須注意敎育、（三）生産化、就是職業化、他們不主張養成一班無業的游民、要使各人受了敎育、都有相當的職業技能、並且敎育不應該限於學校、學校祗能代表敎育的一小部份、不能代表敎育的全部、學校外的敎育、有局樣的價値、所謂社會敎育、他們提倡很力、因爲他同樣的能夠啟發民衆、尤其是俄國、他在敎育行政上不以學校爲單位、卽以敎育事業來靈分爲社會敎育、職業敎育、政治敎育等等、政治敎育不一定辦理小學或中學或大學、這種辦法很値得我們的注意、中國把學校看得太重了、以爲辦敎育只須辦學校、這是錯誤的、（四）關於敎師生活、各國都很苦、像波蘭英國的敎師、工作都很重、以前每週担課二十二節、現在却要担任三十節、薪水有的還要减少、所以他們的生活很清苦的、而且像我國和波蘭的學校校舍建築、也很簡單、但是他們的精神却很好、</p>

<p>— 干</p>
<p>中國現在有兩種炸，一種是炸進去，一種是炸進來。炸進去之一例曰：「日内除飛機往匪區轟炸外，無戰事，三四兩隊·七日晨迄申，更番成隊飛宜黄以西崇仁以南擲百二十磅彈兩三百枚，凡匪足資屛蔽處炸燬幾平，使匪無從休養。……」（五月十日申報南昌專電）</p>
<p>炸進來之一例曰：「今晨六時，敵機炸薊縣，死民十餘，又密雲今遭敵轟四次，每次二架，投彈盈百，損害正詳查中。……」（同日大晚報北平電）</p>
<p>應了這運會而生的，是上海小學生的買飛機，和北平小學生的挖地洞。</p>
<p>這也是對於「非安内無以攘外」或「安内急於攘外」的題目，做出來的兩股好文章。</p>
<p>住在租界裏的人們是有福的。但試閉目一想，想得廣大一些，就會覺得内是官兵在天上，「共匪」和「匪化」了的百姓在地下，外是敵軍在天上，没有「匪化」了的百姓在地下。「損害正詳查中」，而太平之區，却造起了寳塔。釋迦出世，一手指天，一手指地曰：「天上地下，惟我獨尊！」此之謂也。</p>
<p>但又試閉目一想，想得久遠一些，可就遇着難題目了。假如炸進去慢，炸進來快，兩種飛機遇着了，又怎麽辦呢？停止了「安内」，回轉頭來「迎頭痛擊」呢，還是仍然祗管自己炸進去，一任他跟着炸進來，一前一後，同炸「匪區」，待到炸清了，然後再「攘」他們出去呢？………</p>
<p>不過這只是講笑話，事實是决不會弄到這地步的。即使弄到這地步，也没有什麽難解决：外洋養病，名山拜佛，這就完結了。</p>
<h3 id="c231">三年之後 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>他熱切地盼望着明天，明天將給他另一種命運。他眼看自己的身子，給牢獄裏的時光磨壞了，不過他知道自己的心，却没有弄壞的。</p>
<p>天底下就有那麽許多寃枉事情，只爲了同居的一個朋友犯了罪，把他也連累着一起捉進監裏。這朋友是同居後才認識的，他到現在還不十分明瞭那人究竟犯了什麽罪。捉的時候一起捉去，倒也並不値得希奇，住在一所屋子裏，大家又是相彷的年紀，自然很容易被嫌疑的。到了監裏，就有兩個律師替這朋友辯護，却把許多證據和事實，都推在他身上；他雖然否認，爲自己聲辯，總是没有一點用處。他自己没有錢請律師，住在故鄕的爺娘也没有錢給他請律師的。這樣，他便被人判了罪；但他没有知道那個眞是犯了罪的人，是怎樣結果的。就從那時起，他懷疑法律的背後有着什麽東西，法律是建築在什麽上面的。</p>
<p>他終於在同伴們歡送的目光中，離開了這住過三年的牢獄。一走到外面，使他最先感到的，便是外面有光明的天日，新鮮的空氣；然而這光明和新鮮不久又漸漸的遠去，漸漸地黯澹下來了。</p>
<p>街道比前熱鬧了好多。新的建築，煇煌，高大，櫉窗裏的東西眞使人眩目。女人的衣裳長得遮没了脚跟，有些還左一塊高，右一塊低的，好像給成衣匠剪錯了一樣，長長短短的拖在那裏。</p>
<p>他忘記了自己長到三寸多的頭髮，忘記了身上那件又髒又皺的夾袍，只覺得肚子裏空空的怪難受，心裏也是空空的，這眼前的世界，離開自己太遠了。</p>
<p>不知道從什麽地方來的力，想着想着精神倒振作了起來；那些新的恐怖，好比是一根鞭子在他的心頭抽着。</p>
<p>他忘了一切地走着路，因爲他心裏惮憬的東西太多了。在一個大商店門口，他看見一張熟悉的臉，那個人也對他看。眞是再凑巧没有，他仔細一看，這熟悉的臉就是同居過的朋友，就是使他坐了三年牢的朋友。可是模樣兒比從前闊綽得多了。</p>
<p>「沙非，想不到今天會見你的。」那人侷促地先說了。</p>
<p>「今天滿了三年啦，你没有忘記吧。」</p>
<p>「啊，是的，是我累了你……」</p>
<p>「你那時究竟幹着什麽事情，被當局拘捕，害我替你坐三年監牢呢？」</p>
<p>那朋友狠不好意思的回說：「那時候我有許多朋友組織一個會，反對當局，我一面讀書一面就參加這件事。不知怎麽事情洩漏了，就在那一天你跟我一起捉了去，同時還有許多被捉的人。我家裏是有錢的叔叔做着官，我平時就因爲反對自己的家庭，總是跟家裏去鬧意見。那次的事暴露後，家裏却用各種方法來救我，有了錢，有了做官的叔叔，事情便容易辦啦。當時我很反對，可是律師代替了我，說我有神經病，不准我說話。……」</p>
<p>「那末你現在呢？……」</p>
<p>「現在，我自從被法庭開釋後，便再回到我念書的那個大學，在法科畢了業，現在在司法部辦事，……」</p>
<p>原來這位害他坐了三年監牢的朋友却老早在司法部做官了。</p>
<p>他恨他嗎？不的。這並不全是他的過錯。</p>
<p>不過，當這位朋友帶着幾分歉意邀他到他家裏去頑時，他却什麽話也没有說，祗向他投着輕蔑的一瞥，轉身就走。</p>
<h3 id="c232">送葬 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>生才月餘的孩子病肺炎，住在醫院内。照那晚的情形看來，他的旅程似乎快要終結；我看了，心裏也想這也許是最後的一眼了，便對醫院裏的人說：要是有什麽事請打電話通知我。說後便凄楚地踏着返家的步武。</p>
<p>第二天清晨電話來了，說孩子已隨了肺炎長息。</p>
<p>整理了一套製就而尙未穿過的衣服，並出空了一只手提箱，一塊帶到醫院裏。孩子的身體還有些微溫，面色也還没有怎樣改變；我爲他換好了衣服，把他安置在手提箱内。我便送他上那已被預先想定了的葬地。</p>
<p>車到吳淞鎭的時候，我以爲已到了海邊，便漠然地下了車。下了車才知到海邊還有一些路。恐怕洋車太顚簸，我提着手提箱靜默地慢慢走着，從熱鬧的市鎭來到了幾絕人踪的石堤。</p>
<p>那天的天氣的黯淡不下於我的心情，而且還有一些風，因此伴我前去的有石堤上的浪聲。走到堤的中間的時候，風好像尤其緊，浪也尤其重了。我想是潮來了。潮來了也許會淹了這個堤，我又想。我望望前面，又望望後面。我不知潮的來是怎樣的速度。潮的確在來了，而且越來越急了。我還能前去嗎？心中在躊躇，可是脚下還在走着。於是又向後望了望，看到岸與我之間的距離已長於我與燈塔之間的距離。可是要走到燈搭似乎也還要一些時間。回去？我不願意丨我望望手提箱。雖然，我的心並不像浪那麽滾得激越，其實倒可以說依舊很沉靜，而且足步也依舊以原來的速率推移。我想是想到這送葬也許會變成了殉葬，可是我却不相信會有這樣的事情發生。我望到不遠的地方有船停着。這是我對他最後一次的盡心。我要前去，眼望着燈塔。</p>
<p>終於，我走到了石堤的盡頭。我打開　箱子，把他擲在海中。我凝視着他，　隨着浪起伏。好像知道我的心思似地，只顧往外滾，絕不逗遛地，在一些一些小下去，最後，小得爲我的視線所不及。於是我的心中似乎一鬆，以爲他已脫出了這塵世，已脫出了我的心。</p>
<p>我這樣地送了那使我牽掛了一個多月的孩子的葬。</p>

<p>（二十九）　國術與外侮補</p>
<p>芝岡先生見予國術與外侮一文，復以手册中所記明人伍袁華林居漫錄一條相示，始知以國術抗日，明代已有之。而且其人爲東省巡撫，適與今之山東主席職位相當，一古一今，遙遙相對，絕爲有趣，不可不紀也。林居漫錄云：「桐江宋公有口才，酷好術數。巡撫東省時，倭寇朝鮮，警報旁午。公檄登萊兩府各收雞卵數萬。問何用？曰，倭乘舟來，我以雞卵擲之，舟滑，站立不住，悉成擒矣。遠近聞者皆大笑，而蘭谿獨奇之，擢爲少司馬總督征倭軍務。先是有方士張君就者，挾變幻小術，公延爲入幕賓。旣至遼左，則索民間桌二百張，疊架高數丈。君就披髮持劍立桌上，號於衆曰，三日後，當有天兵十萬，助我滅倭。次日夜間，却潛入娼家宿，與一武弁爭，傷目遁矣。公大沮，復謬曰，我更有神術，當使倭酋自縛降我。噫！朝廷縱乏人，奈何令口辯怪迂者當一面，褻中國之威靈，而取四夷之輕侮或？」近數日内，山東省正舉行國術考試，旣徴及飛簷走壁點穴之奇材，當更得吞刀吐火飛劍之俠客。所望異時抗日，迅奏膚功；此等江湖奇俠之士，自當宣付國史立傳，不復勞小說家空爲誑語矣！豈不偉哉？</p>

<p>瞎子（續）</p>
<p>可是雷辟克家的却在使着一套巧妙的手段。她在瞎子身邊擦來擦去，她用肘碰他，她在他的脚上走過，她使他退後，逼着他坐到碗櫃和衣櫃之間，那没有暖氣的地方。瞎子迷了方向，摸索着，做着手勢，他的指頭像畜生一樣攀着。他在黑暗裏面鬧着。他脈管裏的冰塊又凝結起來了，現在他又凍得要命。</p>
<p>瞎子以一種要哭一樣的聲音說完了他的故事。</p>
<p>「是啦，我的好朋友們，完了，没有眼睛了，什麽都没有了，祗是漆黑一團。」</p>
<p>他失手把拐棍弄倒了。這正是雷辟克家的所等着的事情。她連忙跑近去，把拐棍檢起還給瞎子，丨她並没有還給他。</p>
<p>他以爲拿到了，他却並没有拿到。</p>
<p>她是這樣巧妙地騙着他，又使他改變了坐位，她把木鞋還給他，把他向大門那方面引去。</p>
<p>隨後她輕輕地揑了他一把，聊以洩僨；她把他推出門外，推在那下着大雪的暗鬱的天空底下，推在那呼呼怒號的狂風裏面。</p>
<p>在關上大門之前，雷辟克家的對瞎子拚命呌說着，好象對付一個聾子一樣：</p>
<p>「再見啦；不要把錢弄丢了；如果天氣好而你還活在世上的話，下星期日再見啦。眞的！你說得不錯，狄西葉老逢，究竟明天該死該活，我們是永遠不會料到的。每個人都有他的苦惱，而上帝却是一視同仁！」</p>
<p>元旦</p>
<p>天在下雪。爲使元旦成其爲元旦起見，當然應該下雪的。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的隔夜曾很週到地把院子裏的門閂上。一早便有許多頑皮孩子跑來搖着門閂，大家都擠在門外，起初還客氣，隨後生氣起來便用木鞋踢着，末了懶得再等，紛紛向後退走了，但還回過頭來望着雷辟克家的正躱在那兒窺看他們的窗戶，他們的脚聲消滅在雪裏面了。</p>
<p>紅蘿葡鬚跳下床，跑到花園内水槽邊去洗臉。丨但並没有肥皂。水槽已經凍住了。他得把冰塊敲碎，這種早操使得他滿身發熱，實在比烤火爐更加有益的。可是他祗把臉弄濕一下，並没洗乾淨，所以别人常是覺得他髒。丨就是他把臉浸在水裏面洗着，也不過把那最顯着的汚垢除去罷了。</p>
<p>他輕快而又新鮮的參冬與賀禮，他站在大哥菲利克斯後面，而菲利克斯又站在年齡較長的姐姐愛勒絲丁後面。三個孩子一路走進廚房。雷辟克和雷辟克家的已先在那兒等着，俱顯得並没有這回事的樣子。</p>
<p>姐姐愛勒絲丁和他們抱吻着並說：</p>
<p>「早安，爸爸。早安丨媽媽。我恭賀你們新年如意，身體納福，將來昇人天國。」</p>
<p>大哥菲利克斯照樣說着，出口如流，說得快極了，並且同樣抱吻着他們。</p>
<p>但紅蘿蔔鬚却不然，他從帽子裏拿出一封信來。粘緊了的信封上寫着：「呈給我的雙親」。信封上並没有寫上地名。信封角上有一隻羽毛燦爛的珍鳥，作着鼓翼而飛的樣子。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚把這封信交給雷辟克家的，她把信拆開來。信箋上飾着幾朶盛開的花，信箋周圍綴着一圈花邊，紅蘿蔔鬚寫的時候常常把筆落在花邊的眼孔裏，竟將近花邊的字都浸壞了。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨我呢，我什麽都没有嗎！</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨這是給你們兩個人的；媽媽會轉給你看的。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨這樣看來，你偏愛你的母親啦。那麽，搜搜你身上看，看那一枚六個蘇的新幣是不是在你的衣袋裏！（未完）</p>

<p>說起「罷市」，不禁想起去年「一二八」後上海大規模的全市罷市的情形（但不知那時嘉定城裏可也曾罷市没有？因爲嘉定人都没有告訴我過）；說起「嘉定城，也想起去年日本飛機曾經在他們城頭之上耀武揚威的飛翔過，一百幾十磅的炸彈也曾在這方「快樂的」土地上光顧過，嘉定人見了這些也曾嚇得面如土色而向屋子裏或地窖裏躱逃過（但不知這些事在嘉定人的腦子裏還留着些許模糊的影子没有？）但是，據說，去年上海的罷市是「禦侮」，這次嘉定城的罷市，我想大槪亦是「禦侮」。不過上海是因爲東洋人要佔據閘北而禦侮，嘉定城乃是因爲龍船划不成而禦警察大隊的侮，這是稍微有點不同的。然而因此有人便在問：何以說嘉定城裏人罷市是禦侮呢？那末，請聽我道來：</p>
<p>（一）因爲「划龍船」是中國固有的國粹。保留此國粹，與保留古物，發掘古墓有同樣的重要；</p>
<p>（二）因爲「划龍船」是一種快樂的舉動，而且還有一點慶祝的意思。去年東洋小赤老旣然没有把嘉定城轟成像上海的閘北，這還不夠快樂和慶祝嗎？</p>
<p>（三）雖說現在華北危險到了極點，但好在有「聖人」委員們的「三年後彼國内必起革命」和「等候五十年」的玄妙的預言，那麽，我們嘉定城現在又不是北平城，我們何不樂他一樂呢？</p>
<p>（四）經咒可以救國，跳舞也可以救國，那麽，當然「划龍船」亦可以救國了囉！</p>
<p>………等因奉此，警察大隊不知道不懂得這些深奥的理論而竟敢橫加拘捕有道理的人以至於二個，這還不是十足的侮辱嘉定城裏的人嗎？嘉定城裏的人把警察們打得頭破血流，而至演成「全城罷市」，這當然是最有效的「禦侮」手段…………</p>
<p>何况咱家間壁的五老太太亦說，「警察大隊太無道理，太不應該」呢！</p>

<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>朋友　春假早已過去，春也悄悄地歸去來兮，爲着生活而忙的我，反能安閒的坐上京滬車，理由是簡單得很，我們窮人是没有動遊興的資格，坐上京滬車，還是爲着生活。朋友，你知道我在上海新近又Ｏut　of　uob嗎？</p>
<p>去年你們從首都歸來說：「像有夫子廟這樣醜態百出的地方，而對於旅舍中的年輕夫婦儘量盤詰，這就是咱們老大國的把戲！」朋友，鎭江也是同樣的所在。</p>
<p>從朋友家中晚餐出來，一行人踏進鎭江的唯一大旅社大華旅館，牠雖也有浴室等設備，比較起來還在中央神州之下。</p>
<p>「這裏有没有花姑娘？」Ｃ學着洋經浜鎭江話開玩笑說：</p>
<p>「花姑娘有？」茶房回答：「不能到棧房來，被查房間的查着了要抓的。」他的滾熟的鎭江話，我們都笑起來了：Ｃ笑得更　害「花姑娘恐怕還没有這茶房好玩！」說完大家又是狂笑，茶房聽不　我們的話，也莫明其妙的笑。</p>
<p>當天當然不能到什麽地方去玩，但是僅九點鐘光景又睡不熟覺。朋友說：「吞吞土皮吧，我領一個地方去玩。」</p>
<p>「先生，是鎭江人！」茶房以爲我們都是上海來的，聽了朋友的本地話，驚奇的問：「那先生領到後街去玩玩。」</p>
<p>但是我的鎭江朋友還是在上海結識的，他每年在春假時候歸家一個月，他知道後街在什麽地方：不知道後街的姑娘在什麽地方。</p>
<p>我們到了寳塔林，這是公開的清唱塲所，像從前大世界羣芳會唱一般的設　　備，也有奉公安局諭禁止怪聲呌好的白字水牌。花姑娘唱的時候，媚眼亂飛，或者知道我們從上海來的，更特别搔首弄姿。</p>
<p>一個烟鬼似的中年人，從我身後附過頭來，低聲的說：「你老，要點一個曲子嗎？」</p>
<p>我問朋友這是什麽規矩。他說那拉皮條的赤老，你看對那一個姑娘，點她幾齣戲，每齣一元，下場可以到她家去。朋友，大槪夫子廟也是這流場合吧？</p>
<p>踏出寳塔林，朋友遇見一位花叢中的老手，要求他領我門到後街去玩玩。後街是一帶小巷，好像上海的堂子弄堂，不過没有紅燈這類標記，非有熟人是不能問津的，蒙那位先生的允許，我們到了一個呌什麽蘭的家裏坐地，因爲星期六，有許多××局及廳的老爺們在那裏碰和喝酒，巡警在門外像没有這回事一般，據那位先生說，我們特代不是時代了同行被殺，是揭破了這類把戲的緣故。</p>
<p>我希望這封信不要被查到了，不然上海又得開一個大會。今晚已定了遊程，至多五天回上海來。我已購了半打鎭江醋，作送尊夫人的禮物。（未完）</p>

<p>她看到中國人，却是喊爸爸的：</p>
<p>娘姨解釋她的用意告訴我。</p>
<p>「她的爸爸是中國人吧！」「是」的確，中國原料放在外國工廠裏去製造出來的貨物，就頂刮刮的好看。</p>
<p>「她的爸媽很愛她吧？」</p>

<p>「你幾塊錢一月？」</p>
<p>「吃他的飯，四塊錢一月，我不願，還是本國人家裏好，」</p>
<p>「什麽？不是像中國家庭一樣嗎」</p>

<p>「她爸呢？」</p>
<p>「是在洋行裏辦事的，他也怕她的媽」也要駡他，有些時候還要跪她的面前，他爸性子很馴，眞好笑。」</p>
<p>「他們是開心呀！」</p>
<p>「噢：肉麻的又太難看，出門去，倆人要總親嘴，回來也是一樣，」</p>
<p>「這是歐化呀：」</p>
<p>「好啦；你說歐化，她不願意我們說中國話，他說太笨，又不好聽，有時她爸告小囡說中國話，她也要駡！」</p>
<p>「討外國人的老婆，還要跟做外國人嗎？」「不，她媽有家私，聽說他在法蘭西遊學都靠她的。」</p>

<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>上海人的生活，眞是過得有意思得很。一幢小小的石庫門的房子裏居上五六家之多，計前樓一家，後樓一家，亭子間一家，灶披間一家，客堂裏一家，擱樓裏又是一家，合起來的人數，大大小小，男男女女，總有數十之衆。可是，集這許多人居在一起，從來不交一語：大有老死不相往來之槪。這也許是上海人之所以爲上海人的驕傲之氣吧。</p>
<p>我的芳鄰祗和我隔着　層薄薄的板壁，從板壁的縫隙裏，彼此可以相望。我進出都要走過他們的門口。因爲走廊窄狹的緣故，我們走了碰頭的時候，彼此都把身子貼着壁走，以背相向，好像從來不相識的路人似的，走了開去。到如今，我方懂得板壁的用處了，原來隔着一層板壁就猶如隔着一重山呢！</p>
<p>我的芳鄰的居所，只有兩張半八仙桌子那樣大。可是，他們居在裏面的人數就有八位之多。這些人睡在裏面像一條一條橄欖油沙丁魚似的。因爲夏天到了，這些沙丁魚身上發出一股臭氣來，使人不敢嚮邇。</p>
<p>芳鄰究竟幹的是什麽貴業，我無從知道。他們白天睡覺，雖然他們也吃飯，但吃了就睡。晚上是他們活動的時候，床舖一捲，立刻就嘩嘩啦啦的打起麻將牌來。畢畢拍拍的打牌聲，「碰」的高呌聲，算幾番幾五（？）的呌嘯聲，相</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>爭嚷的噪鬧聲，喧擾得震天價響。一直打到了東方發白，他們才鳴金收軍，倦入睡鄕。我這位芳鄰向來不顧他人，他是一個中國人，天下唯我獨尊。所以在他們的喧擾呌囂之下，隔了一層薄薄板壁的我，只好瞪着眼，睡在床上，供他們犧牲，我是失眠了！雖然，我也曾對我的芳鄰說過，請他們改在白天，但我没有這大的威權，去改變他們的國民性。可是，當他們睡覺的時候，雖然是在白天，如果有人噪鬧，就得受他的×嬭娘，猪玀的唾駡。</p>
<p>隔壁的芳鄰，以及離我稍遠的樓上樓下的芳鄰，早上一早就起來把馬桶排滿了自來水管下面，在他們「刷刷刷」的一陣洗刷之後，「嘩」的一下就倒在那兒。他們隨地吐痰，隨他抛擲香烟頭，菓壳，紙屑………這一切都没有人來干涉。這些人家居在一起，各自爲謀，自己居的四方小屋雖然也曾打掃打掃，但公共地方，例如走廊，樓梯，晒台，自來水管空地，是從來没有人過問的。</p>
<p>最後，我只得搬家，讓了他們。但我搬來搬去，所遇的情形都不相上下。</p>
<h3 id="c269">言歸於好！ <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>

<p>— 芬</p>
<p>有許多人常努力的攫住一切的機會，將自己的苦楚：哀怨告訴别人，企圖博得人們的同情。雖然這是最笨的舉動，但是我也是這樣的一個。現在我要告訴你們關於我自己的一切了。</p>
<p>我相信，這裏所寫的决不是我個人的畸形狀態，而是一般看護們的生活素描。當然，這一般關懷社會病態的先生們所願意知道的吧。</p>
<p>我是一個父母早亡的孤伶女子，自小兒便得不着人們的痛愛。我没有錢，我没有方法得着高深的學問，雖然總算是在一小學中畢業了，可是所得的敎育却是十分貧弱。其後因爲在鄕村中没有生活的機會，而自己必須生活下去，於是不得不跟着一個叔父到上海來盡力掙扎了。這掙扎的手段便是當看護。</p>
<p>一提起看護二字，我想在你們會以爲她們的生活一定是過於浪漫的吧，尤其是假如你是曾經住過醫院的男人，那麽我猜得準，你一定立刻浮起那種頭上戴着白布的年青而活潑的笑容。也許這種笑容在你們的回憶中永遠不會磨滅，然而正因爲如此，於是我們的痛苦和悲哀便一點也不會被人們所了解了。我們在你們的心目中少不了是娼婦，說得好聽一點便是有着許多男性的「大情人」。</p>
<p>當然，這不是我自己有意糟蹋，而事實上有許多刻毒的男性曾經率直的告訴過我。起初聽得這樣的話，自然是氣忿不過，少不了要和他理論，但是其後這樣的話聽得更多了，所以只好隨他們說去罷。</p>
<p>爲什麽要阻止别人不說呢？我們爲了要生活下去，便不得不工作，便不得不一天最少十小時在病房中倒馬桶，舖被褥，喂茶飯，通大便，洗滌潰爛了的疔瘡。而且當病人熱度過高而發狂的時候，我們又怎能違反醫生和看護長的命令而不和他們曲意承歡呢？甚至於要抱着一個陌生的男人Ｋiss亦在所不免。至於産婦們的汚血也就夠人嘔吐了。其他替死人塞算孔和嘴巴也是我們的家常便飯。雖然在夜深人靜眼看着一個人死去而不免戰慄。</p>
<p>看罷！我和我們的同伴的生活便是如此。血腥，死屍，尿，屎疲乏，暈倒。</p>
<p>那麽，我應當何以自慰呢？有許多自命爲善男信女，替我們解釋得十分好聽：「博愛」，「仁慈」，「爲了上帝」，「爲了拯救世人」，哼！狗庇，滾罷，我被你們麻醉得夠了。而我所聊以自慰便是直到現在還没有餓死。</p>
<p>那末我希望着什麽呢？我們的生路在那裏呢？一句話，我希望用我們自己的力量來解善我們的待遇，減少工作時間，跟隨着廣大的勞苦羣衆，走向前去，創造出所的天地。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個米店的司賬：七年前，由鄰友作媒，將我的次女許配給同鄕略有田地的周姓獨子爲妻。自從滬戰發生，她倆見過一面之後，她時常有極不願嫁給如此醜貌的佃農爲妻的表示。所以使我亦深深地懊悔。</p>
<p>今天已是他們結婚後第九天了，她頭次進房，就始終不願和她的夫同睡，獨自坐在椅上終夜啼哭：所以他們夫妻二人，毫無愛情。現在對方已派媒人來說：若再如此，要以法律解决了。</p>
<p>先生呀，我眞難極了，若派人去勸她，她是不肯聽的；若說法律解决，那末面子有關。請你給我一個福音罷！祝你健康。　　莊連陞謹上</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者按：這件事，目下莊君的處境，確乎是難極了。但是仔細一想，這種煩惱，也是你自已找來的。你的女兒，旣經事前，有不願嫁的表示，那末你就應該向對方說明，取消婚約。。好在法律規定「父母代訂的婚約，子女成年後，表示反對者，得解除之」。即使有一番唇舌，比了目下的情形，究屬好辦得多。現在呢，旣經望過去勸她不轉，也惟有聽她離異的一條辦法。不過目下離婚，即使辦得到，你所要賠償對方的損失，爲數是一定很可觀了。在結婚時，他們所費的金錢，你是一定要照數賠償，弄得不好，還要出一筆錢，在法律上呌「撫慰金」，作爲賠償對方精神損失的代價。這是一定不易的結果，你還是托托原媒，商酌商酌，免得涉訟公庭，化無謂的金錢。要是商量不妥，那末祇得聽候法律解决。至於面子不面子，倒無庸過慮的。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>（十一）大好年華</p>
<p>柳姑娘旣然打定主意要從新生活下去，於是便從北京遷居到上海來了。理由很簡單，因爲北京只有那種乾燥的空氣，使她覺着厭煩，這使她没有充分的把握還能夠留住她的青春。然而這是否就是唯一不二的理由呢？這一點，即如最親近她如武貴者也是弄不明白的，恐怕只有她自己才會完全知道。</p>
<p>但是武貴自跟着柳姑娘到了上海以後，總覺得比從前榮耀了許多。最顯然的便是他已經是正式的管家，而且是這樣闊綽的家庭，居然是一個大公館，許多娘姨僕役都要受他的指揮，不成問題，當然是夠威風的了。</p>
<p>而且不僅如此，即如這屋裏的一切都使他高興。譬如大門外就有一個這樣的小花園，除了春天的玫瑰和秋天的菊花之外，在夏天他還可以親手種下一些鳳仙。不過柳姑娘對於鳳仙花總是不大愛好，而且對於冬天的水仙也是同樣的討厭，這一點是他不能同意於柳姑娘的。至於屋内的陳設，他却佩服柳姑娘確是能幹，就不知道她是在那裏買來了這許多精緻的傢俱，譬如那種怪軟和的沙發，那種織花的地氈，那種大小不一的茶几。可是擺列的方法又完全不與武貴相同，他是主張在兩只太師椅子中間擺一只茶几，而她却要將茶几歪歪斜斜擺在沙發的旁邊，不免是太不規則的了。至於一張大床放在房子的中間也是不大雅觀的。然而據柳姑娘說這是洋人的格曲。雖然睡覺吃飯不一定都要和洋人一樣，可是自己的主人一定要如此，而且是有意在别人家學來的，也許凡是大公館都應該如此，所以久而久之，也就看慣了。</p>
<p>不過這裏的一切都與柳姑娘的處身立世有關，就連那一隻花了五十塊大洋特地選來的意大利種的小狗也在其内。例如到這裏來的客人都是當今有錢有勢的大老，有時連領帶上戴着金鋼鑽别針的外國人也會坐着汽車來拜訪。所以主人的交際也就廣闊得可以，旣然如此，於是家庭裏的設備也就得堂乎其皇了。至於當她在汽車上必須有一隻小狗偎在懷裏，似乎也是非常合體的，因爲不僅是外國婆子都是這樣，就是中國的紳士太太們也都學會了這一套。那末柳姑娘事實上是紳士們的情人，所以在極細微的一舉一動之間，必須合乎太太們的格曲，像帶小狗一類的事，不過是起碼條件罷了。</p>
<p>總而言之，柳姑娘就是這樣很平安的生活工很久，而武貴每次想起當年的情景，也不免覺得身上怪輕鬆了。</p>

<h3 id="c275">桃花村與春江花月夜合論 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>是歐洲影片改變作風後的新貢獻</p>
<p>日溶化音樂電影於一爐的新藝術</p>
<p>歐洲製片巨頭歐利克龐麥，曾這樣說：「影片的職務·是使用娛樂來呌人忘却一切憂慮，悲愁和不幸的印象。天地間的東西，不能像影戲這樣的普及，就是因爲全世界人類，都很需要娛樂，渴望娛樂。所以那雜着音樂的娛樂影片，更能受人歡迎；致於問題影片，則僅能在一個有限制的某一種社會裏，博得一部份人的歡迎。」他所說的話，對與不對，又是另一問題。但是歐洲影片，近來竟因爲受了這種議論的影響，改變作風，結果幷且是成功了。</p>
<p>我們祇要拿現在開陜的「桃花村」ＨappyＥverＡfter和已經映過的「春江花月夜」來看，不都是利用音樂，造成富有詩意的作品嗎？那末觀衆歡迎與否，已經有事實可以證明了。有人說，這種音樂影片，在美國已經是過去時代的作品了。但是你要知道，他們是别出心裁，獨創一格，把和諧的音樂藝術，貫輸到電影藝術裏面去。和數年前盛行的美國歌舞片，他們簡直把音樂送到死路上去，是完全不同的，這就是因爲善用與不善用了。</p>
<p>說到這兩個片子的情節，固然都是很簡單的：但是在簡單中却都帶着一些幽默的情調。「春江花月夜」是諷刺一班市儈，對藝術家作盲目的捧塲。「桃花村」的故事，是諷刺歐洲明星祇想朝好萊塢跑。確然，凡是歐洲銀幕或是舞台上的明星，祇要有點聲譽，就動輒給美國羅致了去。歐洲的製片家，當然表示不滿。但是不幸得很，「桃花村」片中的女主角麗琳哈蕙，也終於走到了這條路上去。金錢和虛榮的魔力，的確是不小呢！</p>
<p>再說到技巧方面，當然各有各的好處。攝影及取景，在「春江花月夜」裏，是純粹的藝術；而「桃花村」的攝影，却又運用一些魔術了。「春江花月夜」的歌唱，雖然勝過「桃花村」。但是「桃花村」的表情，因爲都是會做戲的演員，却又勝過「春江花月夜」了。再還有，「春江花月夜」是完全一個滑稽片，「桃花村」却在嘻笑中含着一些苦味。後半部有許多地方，充滿着悲哀的情調。總之這兩部片子，度不少爲歐洲的名作，是很値得欣賞的。</p>

<h3 id="c276">評「黑夜繩影」 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>黑夜繩影ＴheＣase　of　the　ＦrightenedＬady·由小說而成爲舞臺劇，再由舞臺劇推演成了影片。在歐美牠是很出名的，我記得在七八年前，有一部美國無聲片，就是脫化于這個劇本的，不過結果並不似舞臺劇那樣呌人滿意。這一次是英國獅子公司出品，眞出乎意外，美國以恐怖片熱鬧了一陣，英國居然也用這麽一張離奇片來投機了。</p>
<p>故事簡單的說是一位世襲爵士，素有遺傳性的精神病，病發時候常用繩殺人，前後被殺有六人之多。警察查緝兇手，毫無眉目。不久，那爵士在舊病復發的時候，對偵探說明了他一切的殺人案件，又拿出手槍來防備偵探要擒他，不料他手指一動，反把自己打死了。</p>
<p>如果在看影片以前，你没有知道這個故事，你就很難猜到兇手是誰，因爲爵士的母親同樣有着重大的嫌疑，而兩個僕人，也有被人欵作兇手之處。</p>
<p>劇義上，最大的貢獻，就是母愛，爵士的母親，是極精明悍辣的婦人，但她用盡了種種的方法來維護自己的兒子，而且又選了一個良好的兒媳，一方面看出她能幹的手腕，一方面更發揚了偉大的母愛。</p>
<p>導演還不錯，結構也還看得過去，不過女郎爲什麽拾那繩子，當偵探到爵士家裏去調查的時候。有一間屋子，是主人不允開鎖的，影片中也輕輕寫過，這個漏洞，却是導演的過失。光線趨向恐怖化的黑暗，頗適合於應有的景况。外景雖少，還都不錯，内景倒眞像原著裏所描寫的，也很吻合於世爵的舊第。攝影很新頴的，用了多數的俯攝和仰攝，頗足生色，可惜對於「繩影」的鏡頭太短太少，略有鬆懈之嫌。</p>
<p>扮演那爵士的ＥmlynＷilliams只有末尾自白一段，是最精彩的，表情沉痛深刻，動人異常。飾爵士母親的ＣathleenＮesbilt也是末尾最好，前半部只能表演出一位能幹的老婦，却不能表現出一位慈母苦心的態度。爵士未婚妻是ＢelleＣhrystall作的，處處露着驚懼的樣子，全片恐怖色彩，她供給得最多。其餘的演員，也和上面三個主角一樣，而且表演平常，没有提到的必要了。</p>
<p>在這片子裏，穿揷可以說没有，本來呢，這一類片子也無須穿揷，不過作偵探的一個呌ＧordonＨarker的，一些幽默言詞動作，如在演講室吃糖等，頗饒趣味。</p>
<p>對白之我，和别的英國片一樣，許多可笑的地方，都包含在對白裏面。</p>
<p>我疑心這是三年前的舊片，不但幕前的職員表片名等，不像近年的新化，而且還斷了兩次膠片。不過，新出品也罷，舊出品也罷，反正牠終是没有呌人失望的。</p>
<h3 id="c277">評「地獄之花」 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>導演手法簡潔</p>
<p>主角表演極佳</p>
<p>在愛情建築於金錢的基礎之上的現實社會中，這片丨丨地獄之花丨丨ＳheＤoneＨimＷrong能夠抓住這種眞實的題材而盡情的暴露，的確是非常得體的。歌女ＬadyＬou爲了以自己的愛情而換取男人們的金剛鑽，不惜盡情的賣弄風騷，使多少男性爲她顚倒，而爲她犯罪下獄。關於這默，少不了有許多熱心的觀衆們要駡她一聲「無心肝的妖婦」，但是，現社會的「愛情買賣」，並不會因此一駡而歸於消滅，反之，假使我們能夠得着多少反省，倒也是應當歸功於本片的。然而整個的劇情是不是我們應當完全同意的呢？不，當偵探Ｃummings帶領警察而將這一班「惡徒」全數逮捕的時候，偵探終於熱戀於舞女的美色而將她徇情釋放，以至於結婚偕老，眞是十分庸俗而不通。固然我們並不必說一切罪惡均應歸咎於這歌女一人身上，而是萬惡的社會使她和他犯罪，可是就劇情的本身而論，爲了使劇情能夠相當合理，這一歌女是應當歸案伏法的。而且即就所謂「維持法治精神」一點說，這一個殺人的兇犯又那能逍遙法外呢？但是唯一的解釋却是「她也曾努力於地方公益」，於此，正暴露了資本主義電影的矛盾性。其次美國電影還要維持那種「有情人皆成眷屬」的老調兒。</p>
<p>至於本片的演出技巧，那末我首先感覺滿意的便是表演的成功。的確，女主角梅樊絲ＭaeＷest充分把握了這種典型女性的特點。她是那樣落落大方，她在危急的時候，又是那樣沉着，充分的擺出她自己的尊嚴，她從極細微的動作中指揮着男人們爲她而摶鬥。她以肉感引誘，她以聲色迷人，但是她一點也不誇張，完全脫除了「慾」和「熱」的庸俗的表演方法。至於她的歌聲也很奇突而動人。假使其如廣告上所說這還是她的處女作，那末我們相信她將來一定是很有出息的「花且」。</p>
<p>然而女主角的成功，當然是得力於導演不少。在這一部片子中，我們正可以看出導演手法的精巧。他相信音樂能助長表情，於是在情話綿綿的時候，配奏着極低微的樂聲。女主角珠光寳氣的在歌聲迷漫中閃爍着，充分表現出黄金色的綺美。其他在演員的小動作也可看得出導演的精細。然而全部没有特别可取的鏡頭，在情調上亦不見成功，這未免是欠缺的地方。</p>
<p>其他各點，我不想多說，反正都在水準以上，總之，在技巧方面，這部片子很可以令人滿意的。</p>

<h3 id="c278">評「除夕」 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 杜存杰</p>
<p>劉繼羣陳燕燕表演逼眞</p>
<p>聯華影片公司新近出品的「除夕」，喧傳了很久、終於今天在「北京」公演了。我看過之後，覺得倒也不錯，没有什麽失望掃興的地方。它的故事係以悲劇作背景，描寫時代的病態，都市社會生活的片面，尙足稱諷刺現實人生的一段含淚的笑容吧。</p>
<p>它的意識很好；那三位主演的劉繼羣，陳燕燕，蔣君超也不錯。尤其劉繼羣和陳燕燕表情甚逼眞，關於導演方面却稍有些美中不足了；如那幕當老翁問明了是押賣女兒的錢，不禁暴跳」起來……此地飾老翁之妻的黄筠貞女士，其時他的表情祇是說女兒自己願意向三嫂押賣換錢，反正女兒長大了總要跟人家的，此情此時，她這樣地没有多大的憂傷哀怨之神情，旣說牠的親骨肉，那末，這麽樣似乎有些兒不合情理。其他倒也還不錯。總算這張片子不使人失望了</p>
<h3 id="c279">評「除夕」中的跳舞 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 龔孟宣</p>
<p>「除夕」中間穿插跳舞一幕，在劇情上不免有點牽强，試想在這怱怱的短時間内，把一個情緒不寗的女子，强逼着學跳舞，任憑跳舞是怎樣的容易，事實上也决不會學了兩三次基本動作，就可以去陪舞的。更顯著的漏洞，就是他在大庭廣衆之間，已鬧了不少踏脚撞人的笑話，竟還有不少的舞客，爭先恐後的向她一人要求陪舞！</p>
<p>總之我覺得導演在「除夕」裏顧是失敗了，這還不在幾個小小漏洞，實在因爲他對於各個人物的個性，没有嚴密的分析，這便是他失敗的最大原因。</p>

<p>The Front Lines Have Entered a State of Truce</p>
<p>Huang, He and Others Confer on Military and Political Issues</p>
<p>The Security of Peiping and Tientsin Has Been Decided With Reasonable Measures</p>
<p>The Political Reorganization Committee Can Be Established After the 10th</p>
<p>(Peiping) Huang Fu, in Peking and Shanghai, had already held detailed consultations with various parties. Passing through Tsinan and Tientsin, he again exchanged views with Han Fu-chu. Last night, he conferred with important military and political figures in Peiping on all matters. Reasonable measures have been decided for the security of Peiping and Tientsin, and temporarily there should be no cause for concern. Military affairs on the front lines entered a state of truce the day before yesterday. Our troops have all reached their predetermined defense lines, and the Japanese troops have also stopped advancing. Part of the Japanese troops in the Shihhsia area have already retreated towards the Gubeikou. The overall situation in the North will have a new development, and as a result, people's hearts are gradually settling down. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After our troops retreated to new positions according to the predetermined plan, the Japanese troops have not advanced for the time being. The battles on all fronts have been quiet for days. In the Gubeikou area, our troops are still holding the Nanshankou defense line north of Miyun. Neither side has taken active action. Part of the Japanese troops in Shihhsia are retreating towards Gubeikou and other places. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) This morning, Ho Ying-chin, Chang Chun, and Chiang Po-cheng successively visited Huang Fu to discuss military and political affairs in North China. Huang separately received Wang Ke-min, Tang Erhe, Liu Zhe, and other political commissars stationed in Peiping to discuss the progress of the political affairs committee. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Huang summoned the heads of the military offices stationed in Peiping to talk at Yiniantang, inquiring about the situation on the front lines. They dispersed around 5:00 PM. Huang is scheduled to meet with Wang and others again tonight. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) On the Peiping-Yuyang Road, our front lines are still near Yutian. The remaining troops have all gathered at the predetermined defense line. Over 10,000 Japanese troops who invaded the west bank of the Luan River and advanced towards Fengrun are still near Fengrun. Several thousand Japanese troops who invaded from Xifengkou and Longjingguan are currently moving towards Zunhua. On the Peiping-Gubeikou Road, our troops are still holding the original positions south of Shihhsia. Most of the Japanese troops who invaded this area are still staying near Shihhsia and have not taken any action. However, a small number of Japanese infantry and cavalry were very active south of Shihhsia on the 18th. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) On the evening of the 17th, He Ying-chin hosted a banquet at Jurentang,</p>
<p>to welcome Huang Fu. Chiang Po-cheng, Chang Chun, Wang Ke-min, and others were invited to accompany him. After the banquet, Huang invited He and other dignitaries to Yiniantang to discuss important military and political issues in North China.

<p>(Peiping) He Qigong said that the central government has already decided on the principles of the organizational plan for the North China Political Reorganization Committee.

<p>(Peiping) At 10:00 AM on the 18th, Huang Fu met with reporters at Fengzeyuan to report on his mission here. Huang said, "What I, as an individual, wanted to say on this trip north was already discussed when passing through Tientsin. Because I have just arrived in Peiping, I am not very clear about the situation on the front lines. I am thinking about the meaning of my mission. I am a political officer, and all diplomatic matters will be handled in accordance with the instructions of the central government. The central government has repeatedly stated this, and President Wang has also made several speeches. I am ordered to come to Peiping to handle matters, and I will not violate the intentions of the central government. Since 1928, I have lived in Moganshan and have not been involved in politics for many years. Old friends often asked me about national affairs, but I declined them all and dared not take on the responsibility rashly. Now that the country is in such a critical situation, and Peiping is my second hometown, I feel that this time coming out to take on politics is different from before. In other words, this time I came north purely with a spirit of sacrifice to save the country from its difficulties. Recently, I went to the South and learned about the situation there in detail. Not only is it very difficult to eliminate the Communists, but their power is also growing stronger day by day. The North has foreign invasions, and the South has hidden dangers lurking. The country is on the verge of collapse. If we wait until it collapses and then try to remedy it, it will be even more difficult. Therefore, even knowing that there is a fire pit, we should jump into it first. The current situation is like us being in the same room. In the summer, we turn on the fan, and in the winter, we use the stove. Right now, it is the hot season, so we naturally need to turn on the fan, but the stove still needs to be kept. We cannot get rid of the stove because we are using the fan. If you say that I came here to sign an agreement, I would never dare to do so. As for the Peiping Political Reorganization Committee, because there are many preparations to be made, and I am currently handling all important matters, it cannot be organized immediately. It will be established after the situation in Peiping and Tientsin has eased slightly, about ten days from now," (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>—Ming</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt, on the 16th of this month, proposed to the heads of state of 54 countries around the world to safeguard world peace, reiterating the essence of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Its content can be roughly divided into the following three points. First, for the deployment of armaments, whether for defense or aggression, he implies serious criticism. And advocate the abolition of aggressive weapons. Second, to illustrate that the aggressive behavior of a country is enough to disturb world peace, therefore, "Each of the contracting states shall faithfully fulfill its obligations and shall each acknowledge that it will not send armed forces of any nature beyond its national borders." Third, he further declared that "Any country that does not participate with true sincerity will increase its armaments to an extent beyond that stipulated in the peace treaties, so that peace will ultimately be unsuccessful. … Then the civilized countries of the world will surely know where the responsibility for failure lies." Such a proposal is indeed the right medicine for the present, and a head-on warning to those engaged in military expansion and armed aggression.</p>
<p>The reason why such a globally sensational declaration was made before the opening of the World Economic Conference and after the initial end of the U.S. financial panic, seems in history to be contrary to the traditional claims of the United States. (Abandoning the Monroe Doctrine) And advocate international arms reduction, international economic cooperation, and communicate with Kalinin, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, with whom the United States has not restored normal diplomatic relations. Not only did it break through historical traditions, but it also abandoned the dominance of temporary emotions, and sought peace between nations. This is why it is worthy of praise by all countries in the world. The President of the United States, in view of the urgency of the world situation and the revelation of the war crisis, and the economic panic, has deepened to the same degree as the deepening of the political crisis. Therefore, the market has become narrower and narrower, and international exchange has shrunk even more. As a result, the number of unemployed people has increased, people's hearts are uneasy, and society is turbulent and unsettled. This is indeed due to the evolution of the inherent contradictions of capitalism, which has led the rich to be "as wealthy as the Big Dipper," while the poor are "too poor to stand on their own feet." The purchasing power of the general public has declined, both at home and abroad. However, upon superficial observation, it is not so. Capitalism itself seems to still have room for development. If the countries of the world can truly cooperate and jointly seek a way to revive the world economy, then the future cannot be said to be absolutely hopeless. However, among the European capitalist countries, the hatred between Germany and France is firmly unbreakable. The former insists on abolishing the Treaty of Versailles and strongly advocates equality of armaments. The latter does not forget its "security guarantee," so it does its best to maintain the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, Italy, which is eyeing southern Europe, wants to dominate the Mediterranean. So it joined forces with Germany, Austria, Hungary and China, and called for a narrow fascist nationalism, which made Europe even more uneasy. The solution to the economic panic will become even more hopeless. Therefore, the U.S. President does not hesitate to sacrifice its "Monroe Doctrine" and advocate world arms reduction to eliminate the political crisis and seek international economic cooperation. Its painstaking efforts are truly commendable.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese militarists in the Far East have not fundamentally recognized the inherent inevitability of economic panic. Instead, they use the non-productive needs of the munitions industry to stimulate general industries and use inflationary policies to forcibly maintain the prosperity of the general economy in numerical terms. Therefore, it disregards international faith and tramples on the "Kellogg-Briand Pact" and all other international treaties. Under the guise of self-defense, it arbitrarily invaded the four northeastern provinces of our country, and created puppets by military force, claiming national self-determination, and in fact carrying out its armed aggression. Now it is even more rampant with its iron hooves, crossing the Luan River, crossing the Great Wall, and spying on Peiping and Tientsin, and disturbing North China. It wants to create its second pseudo-organization. Not only does it nominally destroy international peace, but it will also actually seize the interests of various countries in North China and carry out exclusive occupation. Therefore, the Japanese militarists are alone among the countries of the world, saying that the U.S.'s peace proposal only applies to Europe and not to East Asia, and they continue their armed aggression by sophistry with special circumstances. So how can President Roosevelt's declaration of peace and proposal for arms reduction not be shattered by the Japanese army?</p>
<p>Here, we know that those who are not equal in power are not enough to speak of peace, and those who are not equal in strength are not enough to maintain fairness. The power and strength of the United States in Europe are both barely equal. Therefore, there is room for negotiation for peace. What kind of grasp will it have in the Far East? We deeply sympathize with Roosevelt's declaration of peace and his application for arms reduction, but we are also worried that it will not be easy to succeed.</p>

<p>Reply Letters from Ten Countries Delivered to the White House</p>
<p>Supporting the Proposal to Safeguard Peace</p>
<p>The U.S. Government Focuses Its Attention on the Development of the Situation in North China</p>
<p>Deeply Concerned That Japan Is Obstructing the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House has received reply letters from Great Britain and nine other countries supporting the U.S. President's proposal to reduce armaments and seek peace and economic recovery. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the White House and the State Department are both focusing their attention on the situation in North China, hoping for some development that can help the realization of the world's non-aggression pact. The atmosphere of the disarmament conference has now made significant progress, and the State Department anticipates that Japan will be the most likely to make reservations regarding this agreement. According to unofficial but reliable sources received by the State Department, Japan will be unlikely to accept this proposal until its position in Manchuria can be considered legal under international law. Also, according to news from Peiping and Tientsin, there is a possibility of a truce at this time. If a truce can be achieved, then the Japanese troops will withdraw to Manchuria, and a neutral zone will be demarcated between the Chinese and Japanese armies. If so, it may enable Japan to accept the non-aggression pact unconditionally. Therefore, the White House and the State Department are both paying attention to the development of the situation in North China. It is also heard that the State Department intends to have this agreement established before the opening of the World Economic Conference, but the wars in Manchuria and South America are major obstacles. It is deeply feared that unless the rumored truce in North China resolves the issue of the Japanese troops withdrawing from the South Manchurian Railway's attached lands, President Roosevelt's conditions will ultimately be difficult to fully achieve. As for South America, Paraguay and Bolivia, Peru and Colombia have not yet replied, nor have they expressed any opinions. As for Europe, since German Chancellor Hitler claimed that Germany would conclude a non-aggression treaty and guarantee not to forcibly break existing treaties, it is believed here that the disarmament crisis has been resolved. Furthermore, news that France heard Hitler's comparatively moderate wording and was relieved has also led to what is considered a hopeful phenomenon here. According to official sources, the U.S. President's desire is to conclude a world agreement with absolutely no reservations, because he feels that if there are any reservations, it will lose the original intention of his appeal. However, because Japan is an obstacle, this matter is feared to be extremely difficult to accomplish. (17th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Our Country Is Preparing</p>
<h3 id="e28">To Accept Unconditionally <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Reply Letter Is Being Drafted</p>
<p>Will Be Sent Out Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Roosevelt's application letter, published on the 16th, was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Counselor of the U.S. Embassy on the afternoon of the 17th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs translated it into two copies, one sent to the National Government and forwarded to Chairman Lin in Xi'an, and the other presented to President Wang. The Central Committee held a special meeting for this purpose at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th. Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Wang Shijie, He Yaozu, and others were present. Luo Wengan first gave a detailed report on the background and significance of the application. After careful discussion by the various dignitaries regarding our country's countermeasures, the meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM, deciding to answer Roosevelt in the name of Chairman Lin, unconditionally accepting his proposal in abstract terms. The reply letter will not mention the Far East issue, so the content will be extremely simple. Three people were designated at the meeting to draft the reply, and after a second meeting was held on the 19th to approve it, it will be sent out. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan commented on Roosevelt's application letter, saying that U.S. President Roosevelt has far-sighted insight and advocates that all countries sincerely reduce their armaments and agree to prevent aggression, breaking the selfish and predatory situation and seeking progress for the world's long-term peace, which is admirable and congratulatory for the future of human happiness. However, Luo said that the world's arms race and expansion, as well as the aggressive actions of sacrificing neighboring countries to expand one's own territory, are in fact a minority, but based on our country's direct experience of aggression, it is deeply felt that even this minority of aggressors is more than enough to destroy the peace of the entire world. Therefore, the Chinese government and public believe that in order for world peace to be guaranteed, it is absolutely necessary to have Roosevelt's fourth step before being able to completely abolish offensive armaments. Roosevelt's proposed fourth step states that all countries in the world should participate in a solemn and definite non-aggression pact, each acknowledging that they will not send armed forces of any nature beyond their national borders. However, the Chinese government still has some concerns, because ambitious aggressor countries may not bow their heads and obey because of a solemn treaty. Those who obviously want to destroy world peace often do not consider what is called the responsibility and result of destruction. The peace conference of the European War is still vivid in our minds, but today the artillery fire of eastern Luan is fiercely and cruelly bombing without stopping. Therefore, we can no longer trust the so-called treaty obligations, etc. Wang Jingwei said about President Roosevelt's declaration that it is enough to open the door to world peace and is good news for mankind.

<p>(Washington) It is heard that President Roosevelt intends, if the disarmament conference is successful, to have the United States assist in guaranteeing international security. As for the extent of U.S. involvement, he is now preparing to explain it. It is widely believed that U.S. Presidential Envoy Davis will make an announcement regarding this matter tomorrow in Geneva. The commitment made by the U.S. President must be approved by Congress to be effective. Currently, opposition within the U.S. to American involvement in foreign disputes appears quite strong.

<p>(Paris) After President Roosevelt's letter to the heads of state of 54 nations attending the disarmament conference arrived in Paris, French President Lebrun immediately sent a reply by telegram, stating, "Your declaration issued in the name of the U.S. President has been received. I am deeply gratified by your kind letter. Your high-minded will to pursue world peace and the economic recovery of all nations is unprecedented. The French government shares the same spirit and holds the same goals. Your esteemed letter will be carefully studied." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Our correspondent called on Premier Daladier and asked for his opinion on President Roosevelt's declaration. The Premier replied that he was sincerely pleased with President Roosevelt's declaration, and that its noble ideas should be admired by all the French people. If the directions indicated in this declaration can be followed, the World Economic Conference and the Disarmament Conference can definitely be expected to succeed. France and the United States are jointly maintaining peace in an effective manner, and this is another cause for celebration. Daladier also said that Roosevelt's work benefits all mankind, and he is extremely willing to assist in his efforts and wishes him success. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The leader of the Radical Socialist Party (i.e., the current ruling party), Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee, and former Prime Minister Herriot, attended the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting and described his visit to Washington. He repeatedly expressed his gratitude for the warm reception from President Roosevelt and other important American figures. Herriot then casually mentioned Roosevelt's declaration, saying that it contained two key points: (1) The U.S. government intends to participate in European affairs in a more active and direct manner; (2) The U.S. government clearly opposes any German attempt to rearm. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e31">French Press Commentary is Mixed <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Although French newspapers have mixed opinions on the U.S. President's announcement to the world's forty-four nations regarding disarmament and foreign policy, French Premier Daladier has issued a statement declaring that the U.S. President's statement has given him the most sincere satisfaction. He says that the main theme of the U.S. President's statement will help the success of the economic and disarmament conferences. The U.S. and France are now also jointly undertaking effective actions for the maintenance of peace. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French national morning newspapers have all adopted an extremely calm and cautious attitude towards President Roosevelt's announced disarmament plan. The extreme right-wing newspapers have even resolutely expressed their rejection of it. The greatest causes of this negative attitude are probably (1) Roosevelt did not mention the war debt issue; (2) The declaration did not provide France with sufficient guarantees to avoid foreign aggression; (3) The declaration did not propose appropriate measures to restrain aggressor nations. Therefore, the famous French jurist Mr. Barthelemy wrote an article in the Journal de Paris, stating that the most important part of Roosevelt's declaration is Roosevelt's declaration that the United States is willing to cooperate with other countries to punish countries that disrupt peace. Unfortunately, President Roosevelt did not provide a more detailed explanation of how the United States would cooperate with other countries. Mr. Barthelemy further stated that Roosevelt's declaration did not mention sanctions at all, or perhaps the U.S. President did not want to place this heavy responsibility on the Senate. In fact, France cannot but first demand the greatest possible reduction in armaments before it can feel secure. Mr. Potin of the Echo de Paris rashly refuted the U.S. disarmament plan, claiming that U.S. policy is an ignorant, unthinking guideline. Even if aggressive armaments can be abolished, war can still occur at any time, because the greatest problem today is that treaties are no longer respected and can be arbitrarily torn up. The French army is the greatest force for maintaining existing treaties. If it has to be reduced due to the disarmament conference, then the treaties will be destroyed even more quickly.

<p>(Geneva) League of Nations figures favorably comment on U.S. President Roosevelt's letter to the heads of state of 54 nations, all believing it to be a serious warning to Germany, hoping that Hitler will retreat and save face. German figures here alone express dissatisfaction, especially regarding the section of President Roosevelt's declaration opposing German rearmament. American figures say that President Roosevelt is the first U.S. President in history to make such a clear declaration. The Journal de Genève reports that since the European War, the United States has always been isolated. Roosevelt's declaration this time can be said to be a sign that the United States has begun to abandon its isolationist policy. In terms of world peace, this alone can be considered a courageous expression. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>China's Turmoil is an Inevitable Stage of the Transitional Process</p>
<p>Reforms Currently Implemented are Elaborately Managed with Rapid Progress</p>
<p>Minister Sung's Attendance at the London Economic Conference May Not Be Prolonged</p>
<p>(Washington) T.V. Soong today issued an appeal to America, asking for tolerance regarding China's turmoil. It must be understood that the transition from autocracy to democracy is a gradual process. Allowing each person the right to speak in the process, so that the democratic system can achieve greatness, will inevitably make this process more stable, but also more gradual than under the guidance of an emperor. Therefore, it will take longer for China to achieve its goals, but China would rather spend more time developing from within, becoming a truly large organization, than merely pursuing superficial, mechanical civilization of the new era and the power of new armaments, without seeking spiritual enrichment and the realization of concepts of justice and fairness. The reforms that China is implementing are quite elaborately managed, but these reforms are now progressing quite rapidly. This is an important fact. Last year, China balanced its budget. In these difficult times, and still needing to continue raising funds to resist Japanese aggression, it is able to achieve this result, which is worthy of pride. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Minister of Finance T.V. Soong, accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Shih Chao-chi, visited the White House today to meet with the U.S. President. It is expected that the talks were related to the U.S. President's call for disarmament and proposal for a non-aggression pact. It is heard that the Chinese government's attitude has been telegraphed here. However, today's talks were not a formal discussion and were partly related to issues of the World Economic Conference. As for whether the situation in North China was mentioned, neither side indicated. After leaving the White House, Minister Soong immediately announced that he would be traveling to London on the Aquitania. However, he will not be able to stay in England for long, intending only to attend the opening ceremony of the World Economic Conference and several meetings, and may not be able to stay until the end of the conference.

Simson is now taking refuge in the British Consulate. The protest was delivered to the "Manchukuo" negotiator stationed in Harbin.

<p>(Harbin) Local Japanese newspapers accuse Simson, the editor of the British newspaper, of being influenced by Soviet money and spreading communist writings. They also attack the British Consul-General for harboring Simson in the consulate and say that it is an "unusual" act of preferential treatment by the "Manchu" government that Britain, which has not recognized "Manchukuo," is allowed to have a consulate in Manchu territory. According to reports, Simson has been taking refuge in the British Consulate since the "Manchu" government demanded his expulsion, awaiting the British government's decision. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>The Qinghai-Tibet Agreement Has Not Yet Been Signed</p>
<p>The Xinjiang Incident Can Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Shi Meng, the secretary of the newly organized 9th Division of Qinghai Province, escorted students from Qinghai Province who were recommended to the Central Military Academy to Beijing. According to him, the Dalai Lama has long coveted Qinghai. The reason for the delayed invasion is that Qinghai Province's defense is tight. Last year, Tibetan troops invaded Qinghai, but were repelled by teams dispatched by Ma Bufang's division. At that time, the Dalai Lama was also very worried that the Qinghai garrison would invade Tibet, so both sides proposed signing a Qinghai-Tibet peace agreement this spring. Qinghai Province sent Ma Xun as its representative to begin negotiations, but no agreement has been signed yet. Ma Tengyun will come to Beijing at the end of this month to report to the Central Government on the Qinghai-Tibet peace talks. He left Qinghai shortly after the Xinjiang incident, so he does not know the situation well afterward. The reasons for the Hui people's opposition to the provincial government in this incident are (1) Jin Shuren's maladministration in Xinjiang; (2) The collection of exorbitant taxes and levies, which the people cannot bear; (3) The recruitment of White Russian troops and the arrest of local Hui people. All the ethnic groups in the new province could not bear Jin's oppression and rose up in opposition. Now, he has requested to resign, which has been approved and he has left the province. This matter can be resolved soon. After the Central Government sends Pacification Commissioner Huang Musong to offer comfort, this matter will be easier to resolve. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Puppet Organization Buys the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that the Foreign Ministry and the Army Ministry have reached an agreement on the "Manchukuo" purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Foreign Ministry held an important meeting today, attended by representatives from the Foreign and Army Ministries and Mr. Ohashi, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of "Manchukuo." According to newspaper reports, the discussion was about the valuation of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the method of payment. It is heard that Japan and Manchukuo agree that the Soviet Union is sincere in selling this railway, so it should be purchased to eliminate the source of future conflicts. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army's opinion on the issue of purchasing the Eastern Railway was formally submitted to the Foreign Ministry on the 18th. They frankly stated that the purchase should be made by "Manchukuo." As for the specific issues, they will be decided in the future through negotiations between Ohashi, the "Manchukuo" Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the relevant parties. However, "Manchukuo" has previously taken the position of not recognizing the Soviet Union's ownership of the Eastern Railway, so it seems that a meeting will be convened among the Foreign Ministry, Army Ministry, Finance Ministry, Colonial Ministry, Kwantung Army, and South Manchuria Railway to resolve the negotiations. (Dentsu, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) "Manchukuo" Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ohashi visited Director-General Tani of the Asian Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry at 11:00 a.m. today to discuss the Eastern Railway and other issues. As a result, even if the "Manchukuo" purchases the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union seems to have no objection, so it is beneficial for the "Manchukuo" to conduct purchase negotiations and to open a joint committee among Japan, Russia, and Manchukuo, so efforts are being made to realize this. The committee will be located in Harbin, etc. A consensus was reached, and the purchase price, purchase date, and methods will be decided through further negotiations. (Dentsu, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov has formally proposed the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan. The Japanese government considers this issue to be important and is now carefully studying it. The most important points of this issue are the price and method of payment. The Japanese and Russian authorities have not yet formally expressed any opinions. However, the Russian side insists that the selling price is 300 million gold rubles. The Japanese side intends to purchase it for 80 million yuan because of the recent political and economic significance of the railway. There is now a large discrepancy between the claims of the two sides. As for the method of payment, the Japanese side is considering three options: (1) Transform the Chinese Eastern Railway into a joint-stock organization, with the Soviet Union owning its shares; (2) Pay part of the purchase price with long-term checks; (3) Pay part of the purchase price in cash.</p>
<p>French Ambassador to Japan Martell visited Vice Minister Arita of the Foreign Ministry at noon on the 8th of this month to inquire whether the Soviet Union's proposal to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan was true. France is concerned about this issue because of its debt relationship with Russian banks. The French Ambassador also heard the Japanese government's attitude and policy regarding the establishment of a joint committee of Russia, Japan, and "Manchukuo." Vice Minister Arita replied that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov did indeed propose the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. As for the issue of establishing a joint committee of the three countries, Japan hopes that it will be established as soon as possible. It is heard that the French Ambassador argued that France has a major interest in the Chinese Eastern Railway for the following reasons: During the Russian imperial era, when the Chinese Eastern Railway was built, it was intended to sign a "Contract on the Construction and Operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway" with the Qing government. However, because it was rejected by the Qing government, the Russian-Chinese Bank of the Russian government was the nominal party involved. On February 10, 1895, it invested a principal of 6 million rubles to build the Chinese Eastern Railway, and this principal was provided by a banking syndicate in Paris at that time. Since then, the French government has claimed to have an interest in the Chinese Eastern Railway whenever problems have occurred. However, of the 6 million rubles of the Russian-Chinese Bank, only 5 million rubles were paid. The Chinese Eastern Railway later issued its own bonds and raised a huge sum of 350 million rubles. According to Japanese observations, because the Chinese Eastern Railway did not borrow money like ordinary railways, it was not collateral for the bank. Therefore, France has no legal basis to interfere in the sales negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union. (Japan United News Agency)</p>

<p>Hitler's Speech Has a Positive Impact</p>
<h3 id="e46">Disarmament Situation Greatly Clarified <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>European and American Countries Feel Relieved</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference to Reconvene Today</p>
<p>Obstacles to the Four-Power Pact Also Cleared</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Chancellor Hitler's speech, the German Parliament passed a resolution declaring that the Parliament, considering the equality issue to be vital to Germany's life, is willing to unanimously support the government in this matter. This proves the enthusiasm of the German people for supporting Hitler's claim to equality. Berlin and the whole country regard Hitler's speech as a peace message to the world, because it explains that Germany has no aggressive intentions, does not want to forcibly demand the revision of borders, and if other countries are willing to do what Germany is doing, then Germany is prepared to implement disarmament. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to White House sources, President Roosevelt felt happy after listening to German Chancellor Hitler's broadcast speech, because Hitler supported his movement to seek peace. The White House expressed the opinion that there is now a good reason to be optimistic that President Roosevelt's advocacy of banning aggressive actions will be successful. The U.S. President's proposal to abolish offensive weapons and his endorsement of the principles of the British Prime Minister's disarmament plan have been endorsed by the German Chancellor. The State Department attaches great importance to this point. The German Chancellor's tone can be regarded as moderate and exciting. These are all good signs for Geneva. The State Department considers it most important that Hitler said that Germany wants other countries to disarm, not to rearm itself. This shows that Germany wants to seek some revisions to the Treaty of Versailles by peaceful means, not by violence. As for the German Chancellor's warning that if other countries exert unequal pressure on Germany, then Germany will be forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, it is widely believed that the general moderate attitude expressed in Hitler's speech will prevent the situation from reaching a breaking point. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) German Chancellor Hitler's speech has generally made a good impression. Political circles in Paris acknowledge that his tone is moderate and say that Hitler is clearly trying to please President Roosevelt, MacDonald, and Mussolini. People in Paris believe that Hitler has realized Roosevelt's hints, so he is willing to turn scolding into euphemism. However, the gap between France and Germany regarding disarmament remains as wide as before. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) When the German Reichstag voted to support Hitler's speech, the members of the Democratic Socialist faction of the Reichstag also participated. In the French Chamber of Deputies lounge today, commenting on this matter, Socialist leader Blum declared to our correspondent as follows: "I can explain two things to you regarding this matter. First, there were a limited number of Democratic Socialist deputies participating in the Reichstag meeting this time. Second, the deputies' participation in the vote was contrary to the party's wishes and contrary to the instructions of the party's leadership to the party's representatives in various Berlin councils." Blum also made a statement about the possible consequences of the German Democratic Socialist deputies' participation in the vote, saying, "I can only explain my opinion with extreme reservation on this matter. However, there are differing opinions among the leaders and a large part of the members of the German Democratic Socialist Party. In fact, it can be said to be equal to a split." When the reporter asked about the opinion of the French Socialist Party on this matter, Blum replied, "Our feelings are well known. We believe that the only way to deal with Hitler's dictatorship is to fight to the end. Some members of the Socialist Party believe that a compromise should be adopted towards Hitler's politics, or a passive attitude of endurance should be adopted. We should not cooperate with such party members."</p>
<p>(Paris) According to inquiries made by our representative with the competent authorities, although people generally hold a reserved attitude towards the speech delivered by German Chancellor Hitler yesterday, they do not hold malicious intent. People are particularly concerned about two things: one is the section of Hitler's speech that does not advocate the use of force, and the other is Hitler's permission that Germany will never deliberately destroy the current treaties. Also, judging from the tone of certain sections of Hitler's speech, it seems that Hitler has already changed his policy and admits that some of the methods in his policy are inappropriate. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome The people of Rome all welcome Hitler's speech, calling it a moderate and reasonable article. It is generally believed that his remarks can dispel Britain's fears of the National Socialist Party's policies. His willingness to accept Mussolini's proposed Four-Power Pact and his willingness to sign mutual non-aggression agreements can all dispel rumors that Germany has aggressive intentions toward its eastern borders. The German Embassy has recently been in contact with the Foreign Ministry. Non-political circles believe that the moderation of Hitler's speech may be due to this reason. In short, it is generally felt that the obstacles to Mussolini's Four-Power Pact have now been cleared and its realization is expected. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times commented today on German Chancellor Hitler's speech in parliament yesterday, saying that the world can see a glimpse of Hitler's political skills in his speech. Upon careful examination of his words, it seems that Germany is prepared to make a more reasonable negotiation in Geneva regarding the issue of abolishing the long-serving national defense force. Other British newspapers also have this view, all believing that Hitler's speech is moderate and sincere, creating a better atmosphere. However, the attitude of the German representative Nadolny at the disarmament conference tomorrow will be the true test of Germany's disarmament policy. The British government feels that the world's attention is now focused on Geneva, which will have real progress because of Hitler's speech. The London financial market has also reduced its turmoil because of Hitler's speech. At the same time, prices in the market rose, although there was no shortage of profit-taking, and the close was finally stable. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Definition of "Aggressor Nation" Determined <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) After German Chancellor Hitler guaranteed that Germany would not forcibly violate existing treaties and declared his willingness to support a non-aggression pact, Geneva was relieved today. Although the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference will extend its meeting to Friday to study Hitler's speech, the Security Committee, at its final meeting, adopted the Soviet Union's definition of an aggressor nation. The content is largely consistent with the US President's policy of not sending troops abroad, summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Nations that declare war on other countries</p>
<p>(2) Nations that invade the territory of other countries without declaring war</p>
<p>(3) Nations that blockade other countries by sea</p>
<p>(4) Nations that bomb the territory of neighboring countries in any way</p>
<p>(5) Nations that send troops to land or station land, naval, or air forces in the territory of other countries</p>
<p>Paris reports that the French were greatly relieved to hear that Hitler's speech was not as激烈 as expected. US Representative Davis will soon elaborate on the US President's proposals at the Disarmament Conference and declare that the United States is willing to sign a consultation pact and support the supervision of armaments. (Seventeenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Hitler's speech has aroused a generally favorable impression here, considered skillfully worded, especially moving to the Anglo-Saxon nations. Many believe that Hitler has shown that he is worthy of being a politician, but Geneva disarmament experts have given it extremely harsh criticism, saying that the German Chancellor's words are not much different from the theory held by the German representative to the Disarmament Conference, Nadolny. The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference was originally scheduled to meet on Thursday, but now it has been changed to Friday afternoon, when German representative Nadolny and French representative Paul-Boncour will both be able to arrive here. (Seventeenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since the publication of Chancellor Hitler's speech in the Reichstag, various Berlin newspapers have published lengthy reports and unanimous commentaries in support. The Börsen Zeitung reported that, in order to dispel world mistrust, Hitler has spared no effort to place all organizations of the National Socialist Party under international joint management. However, it is absolutely necessary that equal organizations in all countries should also be subject to international joint management in this way. The newspaper stated that this kind of concession is more important than lengthy verbal debates and can dispel the years-long rumors of secret German plans, like clearing away clouds and seeing the light of day.

<p>(Nanjing) On the 15th, Liu Xiang telegraphed his representatives in the capital, stating that with national disaster imminent and the communist threat not yet quelled, it was deeply regrettable that Deng Xihou and Liu Wenhui were engaged in internal conflict. In addition to telegraphing President Wang and Chairman Chiang, requesting strategy, he also telegraphed Liu and Deng, asking them to cease fighting and resist foreign aggression. He is currently making every effort to mediate, hoping to eliminate the war and pacify the region. (Eighteenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

Tian Songyao and others are indignant at Liu's opposition to mediation and have dispatched the Huang and Zeng divisions, concentrating in Deyang day and night. Li Qixiang's division is also completely moving towards Ziyang, all to support Deng's army and seek to shorten the Sichuan war. (Eighteenth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 17th, Deng Xihou sent a telegram to the Central Government, exposing Liu Wenhui's crimes as the initiator of the troubles, requesting the Central Government to sternly order him to stop and instruct Liu Xiang to supervise and enforce the Central Government's orders, using armed sanctions and adopting effective measures.

<p>(Nanjing) The civil war between Deng and Liu in Sichuan has expanded. Military authorities have received definite reports: (1) Liu Wenhui is pressing Deng step by step. Deng has abandoned Pixian, Pengxian, and Ziyang, concentrating heavy troops in the Xindu and Hanzhou areas, where a major battle is imminent. (2) Tian Songyao's units, Huang Zhenggui and Zeng Nanguang, are concentrated in Deyang, ready to support Deng when necessary. (3) The Deng generals and officials' families in the provincial capital have all been moved. Deng Xihou's headquarters only left a platoon of guards with rifles. Hu Kairong's brigade has also moved to Deyang. All Chengdu agencies have been taken over by Liu, except for the municipal government, which has not yet been received, intending to persuade Chen Shunong to return. (4) Liu Xiang claims to be mediating this war, hoping not to expand it, and has sent Yan Zhongqing as a representative, accompanied by Deng's representatives Huang Shixue and Wang Junming, and Yang Sen's representative Huang Jinhuai to the province to mediate between Liu and Deng. (5) Liu Wenhui has ordered his army's ordnance depot to work day and night to rush production of bullets, issuing them as soon as they are made. (6) The postal and telegraphic inspection in Chengdu is extremely strict, and the people are panicking. Rice prices are soaring. (7) Deng's headquarters has moved to Hanzhou, intending to find a way to resist. (8) In addition to sending representatives to the province, Liu Xiang has repeatedly telegraphed both sides to advise them, and has also summoned representatives from both sides, declaring that no matter how the conflict evolves, he will not change his original intention of peace. (9) Tian and Deng are closely related, showing his support for Deng. He has now allocated fifteen regiments to concentrate in Deyang, ready to respond as needed. As for other units, Yang Sen has no indication, and Liu Cunhou of Suiding is unable to intervene due to banditry. Li Qixiang is inclined to protect Deng, but there is no military action yet. According to those familiar with the situation in Sichuan, the conflict between Liu and Deng cannot be avoided. Although Deng's forces are small, they can still fight. After the conflict begins, Liu Wenhui will inevitably suffer significant losses, but Liu Wenhui's army is very large, and Deng will inevitably fail in the long run. (Eighteenth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deng Xihou's telegram on the 14th, stated: (1) Liu Wenhui despises the Central Government, stopping military operations and strictly ordering the advance, leaving me with no room for tolerance, forcing me to start a war. (2) Clearly supports the red bandits disrupting Sichuan, restricting our army from participating in bandit suppression work, intentionally disobeying Chairman Chiang, and not invading the defensive zone, leading to internal strife and creating opportunities for the red bandits in the telegrams. (3) Has been the chairman of Sichuan for many years, with no governance, and now obstructs other troops from suppressing bandits, harming the people and destroying the Sichuan situation. (4) Please ask the Central Government to uphold the law and justice, and severely punish Liu Wenhui, who has caused the local government to fall into ruin for no reason. (5) I hope that all parties will advocate fairness and speak out for justice, curb tyranny, and serve as a warning to those who like to cause trouble. (Eighteenth Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Supreme Court Judgment</p>
<h3 id="e52">Case of Traitor Hu Lifu <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Appeal Rejected, Hu Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the case of the traitor Hu Lifu, the Jiangsu High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment. The prosecutor of the court disagreed with the verdict and filed an appeal. The Supreme Court has recently issued a judgment, of which the main text, facts, and reasons are excerpted as follows: (Main text) The original judgment regarding the crime of serving in the enemy army and the execution of the sentence are both revoked. Hu Lifu is sentenced to death for serving in the enemy army, and deprived of his civil rights indefinitely. Combined with the sentences imposed by the original judgment for the crimes of intending to profit by providing gambling venues, selling opium, and intending to profit by providing opium dens in hostels, the death penalty is executed, and civil rights are deprived indefinitely. The rest of the appeal is rejected. (Facts) After the January 28th Incident, when the Japanese army was causing trouble in Shanghai, and our 19th Route Army retreated to the second line of defense, Zhabei was occupied by the Japanese army. Hu was introduced by Japanese person Washizaki to the 4th Unit of the Japanese army. Initially, translators and others from the four battalions formed the Jiangbei Command. After it was disbanded, Washizaki introduced Hu Lifu. Then, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army, Sawamatsu, and the commander of the 4th Battalion, Yamashita, ordered Hu to organize the Beishi Local Citizens Maintenance Association to replace the Jiangbei Command, and Hu was appointed as the chairman. The association was divided into six groups: general affairs, finance, patrol officers, investigation, transportation, and sanitation. There was also a social group. The association had about four to five hundred people. The association's affairs were handled in accordance with the wishes of the 4th Battalion of the Japanese army. All residents moving out of Zhabei were assessed a fee of 2% of the value of their goods, and Hu issued exit permits, which the Japanese army checked and released. In ten days, more than 3,000 yuan was extorted. Japanese soldiers often came to inspect and Yamashita praised Hu. The maintenance was very good. Later, after the League of Nations inquired with the Japanese consulate, it was canceled. Therefore, after the cancellation, the Jiuhe Company was organized to open gambling houses, opium dens, and sell opium, which was still presided over by Hu. Two weeks later, more than 9,000 yuan was collected again. When the Japanese army withdrew from Zhabei, Hu, fearing punishment, hid in Washizaki's home. He was repeatedly ordered to be arrested but was not found. It was not until September 16th that Hu was arrested by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and sent to the prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court for investigation and prosecution. (Reasons) This case is divided into two parts: (1) Regarding the organization of the Maintenance Association, Hu confessed to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, "Washizaki called me out, and also said that the Japanese headquarters wanted me to organize the Beishi Local Citizens Maintenance Association. I am the chairman." He also said, "There are plainclothes patrol officers to maintain local order." He also said, "We cannot violate the comrades of the 4th Battalion in our work." The collection of freight handling fees was entirely handled by me. The appellant has already confessed in detail how he entrusted Washizaki to dredge up the organization of the Beishi Local Citizens Maintenance Association to replace the Jiangbei Command, how he was commissioned by the Japanese army, was inspected by them, how he divided into groups to handle affairs and added female inspectors and police detectives, how he inherited the Jiangbei Command's methods, and levied freight handling taxes. How he maintained the rear for the Japanese army when it was unable to maintain public order. How he handled affairs in accordance with the wishes of the 4th Battalion of the Japanese army. All these things have been confessed without denial. This is consistent with the investigation report obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Government. As for the appellant's defense that the purpose of organizing the association was to handle charitable matters, and provide proof, based on various facts, it is difficult to conceal that he was commissioned by the Japanese army. In addition, the appellant also argued that he did not serve in the enemy army and had no behavior that endangered the Republic of China. The appellant was commissioned by the Japanese army and openly organized an illegal organization to maintain order in the rear for the enemy, which increased the danger of the national army resisting the enemy. If this is not called serving, what is serving? If this is not called endangering the Republic of China, what is endangering? The above situation is really unforgivable. The prosecutor said that the original sentence of only life imprisonment was too lenient, and it is hard to say that there is no reason. (2) Regarding the organization of the command, Hu confessed, "After we retreated to Linping Road on April 11, I wanted to organize the Jiuhe Company to open businesses such as buying and selling opium and tobacco, and I was responsible for it. After two weeks, a total of more than 9,000 yuan was collected." The appellant has already confessed the details in detail, which is consistent with the investigation report obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Government. There is nothing inappropriate in the rules of evidence adopted in the various crimes sentenced by the original judgment. The appellant's grounds for appeal are still untenable. Based on the above arguments, in accordance with Article 409, Paragraph 1, Article 410, Paragraph 1, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 42, Article 109, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 6, Article 10 of the Emergency Crime Punishment Law for Endangering the Nation, Article 74, Article 120, Article 57, Paragraph 3, Article 70, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and Article 408, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is made as in the main text.

<p>Wu Tiecheng Reports on the True Meaning of the Commemoration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held the 17th anniversary of Yingshi's martyrdom on the morning of the 18th. Present were Central Committee members Li Ciwen, Chen Shuren, Huang Jichen, Ye Chucang, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Chaojun, Wang Qi, Wang Zhaoming, Gu Zhenggang, Bai Yunti, Chen Guofu, Ju Zheng, Jing Hengyi, Shi Qingyang, Zheng Zhanan, Chen Zhaoying, Yu Jingtang, and representatives from various agencies and staff, totaling more than 600 people. Wang Zhaoming presided over the ceremony, led the rituals, and presented wreaths. Wu Tiecheng then reported that today is the 17th anniversary of the martyrdom of the martyr Yingshi. At that time, everyone knew about the circumstances of Mr. Yingshi's revolution in Shanghai and the process of his martyrdom, so there is no need to repeat it. However, now, in the face of serious national difficulties, with enemies pressing from the outside and red bandits disturbing from within, it is a time of life and death for the nation. Commemorating Mr. Yingshi only increases our infinite regret, because the comrades of our party are still unable to unite with extreme sincerity. This is the most painful thing we can do today. However, this only increases the infinite difficulties for the comrades in charge in Beijing. Therefore, in addition to grief, we cannot but recall Mr. Yingshi's loyalty and courageous spirit to the revolution, recall his legacy, to inspire our spirits, not to be discouraged or disappointed, to express our loyalty to the party and the country, to inspire those comrades who have not been able to unite, to jointly face the national crisis, to encourage the people to unite against foreign enemies, to support the government, and this is the true meaning of today's commemoration of Yingshi. After the speech, the meeting adjourned. (Eighteenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Liu Zhenhua, the soon-to-be-appointed Chairman of Anhui, visited Chairman Chiang at 9:00 AM on the 17th to discuss governance guidelines and request instructions on bandit suppression strategies. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the bandit suppression plan for the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui has been decided, and it is expected that the bandits can be eliminated within three months. However, the aftermath is difficult. All important policies, such as recruiting and appeasing refugees, relieving rural areas, and organizing Baosheng and Baowei, must be carried out simultaneously. Only after the main bandits are eliminated can the scattered bandits not be allowed to lie dormant, which can be said to be successful bandit suppression. There is also a whole plan for the post-recovery of the bandit areas. The funds will be shared by Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. The bandit suppression troops in the border areas of the three provinces have more than a dozen divisions, divided into three major tasks of suppression, defense, and clearing. Each army is responsible separately. I will follow the central government's wishes in the governance policy of Anhui, and I will do my best to handle it. I dare not be hypocritical, take comfort in the status quo, or forget the suffering of the people, in order to save the country from danger. As for the date of assuming the new positions of Chairman of Anhui and Commander-in-Chief, it can be decided after returning to the defense in the coming days.

I have long been厌恶with my political life, but I was invited by Chiang and Cai to talk about the past. I came to Fujian for the first time and haven't met with Chairman Chiang, so I am not familiar with the situation and have no opinions yet. I will go to the province in a few days and I hope to find a quiet place to read books between Gushan and Wushi and abandon my political life. Cai said that although the Central Government has not designated a route for the Anti-Japanese Army through Hunan, our army has long planned to pass through a certain place and concentrate in a certain place to go north, and the Central Government will agree. I think it doesn't matter whether I take office or not in practice, so I have not decided whether to take office yet as the Commander of the Five Provinces' Bandit Suppression Front. Also, our army is responsible for the left wing of the bandit suppression, and I don't need to go to Jiangxi. As for supervising the army north, I will go there when the troops arrive in a certain place. I will accompany Chen to the province as soon as there is a ship back to Zhanghou.

<p>(Nanjing) The Chairman of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee in Geneva made an important statement regarding the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs. It is also reported that the convention is scheduled to take effect on July 9th. A reporter interviewed Mr. Zheng Yanfen, Secretary of the League of Nations, who stated: (1) According to known statistics, the production of morphine in major countries has increased from 30 tons to 59 tons, an increase of approximately 50%. Of the 266 tons of morphine produced by various countries, at least 72 tons have flowed into private sales. Therefore, the convention was established. This convention represents significant progress compared to the Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention. The purpose of this convention is to strictly investigate the distribution of narcotic drugs and directly limit production. (2) The 1931 Convention has five advantages over previous conventions: (1) The scope of restrictions is broader and more clearly defined than before. (2) The total annual production worldwide is not freely determined by the manufacturing countries but is decided based on the prior estimates of the consuming countries. (3) Each contracting manufacturing country should compile statistics annually and send them to Geneva for review by the four Central Supervisory Committees, which will assess the estimates of the legitimate necessary quantity of a certain narcotic drug. (4) The articles on prohibition restrictions and acceptance are more stringent and practical than before. (3) From a legal and economic perspective, this convention has special provisions for industrial and commercial issues. Not only do the contracting countries have obligations to fulfill, but non-contracting countries can also impose restrictions. This convention represents the first attempt to control the narcotic drug industry with the power of nations and international organizations. The contracting countries authorize international organizations to determine production volume based on the estimates of each country and to supervise distribution and consumption. This is unprecedented in economic history. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Major Personnel Changes in the Ministry</p>
<p>Shiratari Transferred to Sweden as Envoy</p>
<p>Tani Appointed Senator of Puppet State</p>
<p>▲ China United News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will transfer major personnel within the ministry. It is rumored that Minister Mushanokoji will be appointed as the Ambassador to Turkey, and Shiratari Toshio, the Director of the Information Department, will succeed him as the Minister to Sweden. The Director of the Information Department will be transferred from either Councilor Amano or Director of the Commerce Bureau Kurisu. This transfer is scheduled to be decided at the regular cabinet meeting next Tuesday. The reason for Shiratari's promotion is that he has effectively cooperated with the military since the September 18th Incident and has been meritorious in advocating a tough diplomatic stance towards China. This is the result of being pushed forward by the military.</p>
<p>▲ Den-tsu News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The resignation of Vice-Minister Arita was due to the sharpening of his opposition to Shiratari, the Director of the Information Department. Therefore, Shiratari's transfer can be said to be a mutual loss and contains the implication of refreshing diplomacy. It is also said that Tani, the Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau, may be appointed as a Senator of the (puppet) state. The scope of the changes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to be quite broad. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Uchida said that this matter does not imply any change in diplomatic policy.</p>

<p>Plans to Urge Minister of Finance to Stay</p>
<p>Trial for Assassination of Inukai to Begin in September</p>
<p>▲ Den-tsu News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The May 15th Incident can be said to have come to an end with the announcement made yesterday. Prime Minister Saito is quietly observing the movements in the political world regarding the resolution of the issue of Minister of Finance Takahashi. Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Horikiri and those close to the Prime Minister believe that Minister Takahashi may retract his intention to resign and are planning a meeting between Saito and Takahashi. After the announcement of the May 15th Incident, if no special incidents occur, Prime Minister Saito will invite Takahashi to his residence at the beginning of next week, citing the gravity of the situation and the impending economic difficulties as reasons to strongly urge the Minister of Finance to retract his intention to resign. However, the Seiyukai believes that, based on the Minister of Finance's attitude and past statements, it is doubtful whether he will retract his intention to resign. In short, the Minister of Finance's decision to stay or leave will have a significant impact on the political situation. The meeting next week will attract significant attention from all sides.</p>
<p>▲ Den-tsu News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The first public trial for the civilian defendants in the May 15th Incident has been scheduled to begin in early September. The content of the crimes is the same type as the Blood Pledge Corps Incident, so the trial will be conducted in the same manner as the Blood Pledge Corps Incident, with Judge Sakamaki and Prosecutor Kinouchi still in charge. On the other hand, the naval defendants will have a public trial at the Yokosuka Naval Court-Martial. The first trial, if as scheduled, will be in late July or early August after the Grand Exercises. The judges will be appointed by Naval Minister Osumi and consist of five judges. Each defendant is limited to two lawyers. There are many lawyers who wish to defend the defendants. Also, if the proceedings on the army side proceed smoothly, the first public trial can be held in late August. The judges will be appointed by the Commander of the 1st Division, Hayashi, and consist of five judges.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Accident Investigation Report <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Caused by Poor Piloting</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 17th: The report on the investigation of the Akron airship accident was released today. According to the report, the cause of the accident was due to errors in judgment and incorrect commands. No defects were found. The ship's commander, McCracken, had poor orientation, causing the airship to enter the center of the storm, where it was blown down by strong downdrafts. However, the incompleteness of the weather map made accurate judgment difficult. Furthermore, McCracken's order to change direction by 15 degrees was misunderstood as 50 degrees, which led the airship into the lightning that it had been trying to avoid, also contributing to the accident. Senators now believe that the report does not address many issues of particular concern to the Senate and may form another committee to investigate the case before the recess. Today, several senators pointed out that the commander of the battle fleet forced the best aviation experts to depart with the fleet, leaving less experienced individuals in charge of the airship, which was the fundamental cause of the accident. It is said that if Lieutenant Colonel Rosenthal had commanded the ship, such an error in judgment would not have occurred.</p>

<p>The War Has Abated</p>
<h3 id="e91">New Developments in the Northern Situation (Reaching) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Huang Fu Comes to Beiping to Preside, Tianjin and Beiping May Be Safe for Now</p>
<p>Japanese Military Aims Focused on Completing Manchuria-Mongolia Policy</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Although the Japanese military's large-scale invasion this time involves an extreme conspiracy, its main purpose remains to ensure the occupation of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe-Chahar, and to complete its Manchuria-Mongolia policy. If it can gain a considerable grasp on its main objectives, then it can temporarily satisfy its demands and no longer advance endlessly. Recently, in the first step of its plan, the eastern route occupied Luanzhou and Fengrun, important towns, and the northern route occupied the key passes of Shixia and Miyun, taking dangerous positions to threaten Beiping and Tianjin. This has largely satisfied its wishes and can be considered a small conclusion to the military action, temporarily waiting for changes in the situation to determine its future course of action. Since the frontline became tense and Beiping and Tianjin were in danger, we have considered Beiping and Tianjin as the lifeline of the north, of utmost importance. If there are any oversights, the whole country will be shaken. It is imperative to use all efforts to ensure their safety. In addition to deploying large forces to make preparations for combat and defense, practical and appropriate measures are also being taken. Jiang Bocheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Military Council, went to Tianjin the day before yesterday to meet with important figures in Tianjin to discuss matters. At the same time, important generals from the front have also been ordered to come to Beiping to discuss everything in detail. The security of Beiping and Tianjin can be assured for the time being. Huang Fu, the newly appointed Chairman of the Administrative Yuan's Resident Beiping Political Affairs Committee, has discussed relevant measures for northern political affairs with key figures in the central government in Nanjing and Shanghai, and will come to Beiping to preside. The northern situation is likely to have new developments. Several days ago, a Japanese man named Nagai indicated to a certain party that the Japanese military's current rapid occupation of Beiping and Tianjin has small benefits but large targets, which is not cost-effective. Chahar has an extremely large relationship with Manchuria and Mongolia, and it is imperative to take it, and so on. The Japanese are extremely cunning, and it is questionable whether this statement is credible, but based on a general assessment, it is likely not far from the truth. Mutō, the Commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, issued a statement yesterday, stating that the Japanese military's objectives have been achieved and that if the Chinese army abandons its challenging attitude, it will withdraw. This statement is very smooth, and it seems to be issued for a reason. In the near future, a live drama of withdrawing troops from Luan East may be staged again. Since yesterday (the 15th), the war on the front lines has abated. Although the enemy occupying Shixia continues to attack our new positions in the Jiusongling area, its momentum has been greatly reduced compared to the past few days. This morning (the 16th), the Japanese military did not take any active actions and has sent Mongolian puppet troops to build solid defensive fortifications and set up electric wire nets within its positions, seemingly intending to switch from offense to defense. Several Japanese aircraft continue to scout and bomb Miyun, but their intensity is not as fierce as in the previous two days. On the eastern route, the situation in Tangshan was once chaotic, with passenger trains only running to Lutai. The phone lines to Fengrun are still down, and the situation is unclear. The majority of our army is concentrated in the Lutai and Yutian areas. There were no fierce battles between the two sides last night and this morning. Precautions in Beiping and Tianjin are still very strict to prevent criminals from taking advantage of the situation, but the morale of the people has been much calmer than in the previous two days.

<h3 id="e92">Enemy Re-Attacks the Central Eastern Line Situation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Special Telegram from Xu Ge Zhuang: Military secrets, rapid shifts, distant rumors, difficult to discern the truth. Even close-range interviews are hard to immediately publish. However, facts are facts, shifts are shifts. The advance, retreat, victory, and defeat of the war are facts and cannot be hidden forever. This time, the enemy is once again launching a large-scale attack south of our Great Wall line, attempting to encircle Tianjin and Beijing, and sweep across North China. The situation is extremely clear. Here, I will continue from my previous dispatch and briefly describe the war situation on the eastern front, based on my personal observations. Since the enemy launched its attack on the 7th, its main force has been advancing westward along the Pingyu Highway. The defending troops of He's unit, stationed on the Kailuan section of the railway which runs almost parallel to the highway, have also been affected. This is a vicious tactic adopted by the Japanese army. However, if our railway line defending troops can maintain a spirit of sacrifice, and resolutely defend the strong fortifications already built at key locations west of Luan and in the Kailuan section, the enemy forces advancing westward along the Pingyu Highway will inevitably have concerns about their flanks and rear. They can then genuinely link up with Wang Yizhe's troops, who are desperately resisting the brutal enemy on that highway, and support each other, seize opportunities to adopt pincer or flanking tactics, constantly send strong cavalry to harass the enemy's flanks and rear, and let armored vehicles continue to operate as guerrillas along the railway line, to fulfill their responsibility of liaison, cover, and emergency response. Even if they cannot achieve a major victory, they can still slightly blunt the enemy's momentum, making it difficult for them to fulfill their ambition of quickly capturing the towns and villages they have invaded, even if they pay the highest price. At the same time, Wang's and Weng Zhang's divisions will not have to solely face strong enemies and endure intense sacrifices, to the point where they cannot even get a moment to regroup and reorganize after each intense battle. This kind of war situation can be discerned from the accounts of wounded soldiers from Wang's unit encountered at various stations, crawling their way here, or from the words of fleeing soldiers lingering and waiting to be taken in. Currently, the enemy forces are still divided into two routes: one is fiercely attacking westward towards Wangguanying in Hazelnut Town, east of Fengrun County. In the past two days, enemy planes have already flown to Fengrun City to drop bombs. The county magistrate, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, and wealthy merchants have all fled to Xugezhuang and are living in a school. It is said that there are still more than 200 members of the defense corps in the city, cooperating with the army to maintain order. The other route is following and pursuing our retreating army along the Beining Road, probably because of international relations, and because they know that the defending troops on that road will inevitably be drawn back by the advance of the enemy forces on the left flank, so the troops they have sent are mostly puppet troops, not the main force. Our army retreated from Luancheng and other stations, villages, and towns, and the enemy only dared to invade the next day or the day after. On the night of the 12th, the reporter retreated with the army from Luancheng to Guye. At 2 PM on the 13th, I heard the order to immediately transport heavy materials to the rear. At 8 PM, just as I was about to go to bed, I heard the order to retreat to Xugezhuang immediately. In two nights and one day, the retreat route was nearly 200 li. The refugees along the way, who were following the army's advance and retreat, suddenly panicked like startled cranes, and were as chaotic as ants in a hot pot, not knowing what to do. People eagerly vying to get on the westward-bound trains rubbed shoulders and were extremely crowded. The cries of children and the rattling of carts echoed endlessly, and it was even more difficult for women who needed to relieve themselves to do so than climbing to heaven. Only then did I realize that the refugees were mostly middle-class or lower-class families. Those above the middle class had already fled to Tianjin and Beijing after the fall of Yuguan, leaving hardly anyone behind. This is no exaggeration. At the Zhang family in Xugezhuang, where the Central Propaganda Team was staying, plaques inscribed with "Eager for Public Good" and "Respectful of the Hometown" erected in the second year of the Xuantong reign were hung in the front hall. The floors were inlaid with tiles, and the walls were painted, the building was magnificent, no less than the wealthy in the city. However, because the family had taken their family far away to avoid the disaster of war, the carved windows of their halls were mostly nests for crows and sparrows. The chirping of the chicks was within reach, the desolate state was lamentable. The village had a market day yesterday, every five days, and the buying and selling of goods was mostly pig bristles, the whole city smelled strangely. Next were grains and groceries. The grains in eastern Luan were mostly insufficient for local production, and in previous years, they relied entirely on the northeast for adjustment. Now they rely on Shanxi. The transaction of this season's seeds is extremely cold. The spring planting has already been missed, and the autumn harvest will be even more hopeless. At about 11 AM, when the main street was bustling with people, three enemy planes suddenly flew in, rumbling. They reconnoitered for a week, and then flew away. But the city's merchants have dispersed in an uproar, and the refugees waiting for the train at the station were even more trembling and had nowhere to hide. This plane was flying from the northeast along the railway line to reconnoiter at various stations. In Tangshan, it dropped two bombs, which slightly damaged our supply vehicles. Soon, ten newly built locomotives and countless important machines were transported from Tangshan, along with more than ten baggage cars, full of ammunition and flour. A soldier tried to board, but was scolded by the train's guard, saying that it was an ammunition car, and even if he had a pass, it would be difficult to go along. The soldier was not convinced, and the two sides argued, even drawing their knives at each other. Later, an officer saw it, fired a shot to scare them away. On a wounded soldier's car, there were several civilians, also covered in blood, groaning incessantly. I went over and talked to them, and they replied that they were from a village in Ninghe, and they were hired by the local area to follow the carts to the front. The conditions were that those who had money would contribute money, and those who did not would contribute labor. The employer would first give them ten yuan for living expenses, and they would agree that if they returned home safely within a month, the cart and horse would be divided equally. If they returned home after a month, they would enjoy all the benefits. If they unfortunately encountered an accident, it would be regarded as a national service. The convoy consisted of more than 30 carts. A few days ago, they were transporting them to the Shaheyi·Laoyemiao area. Suddenly, three enemy planes attacked, dropping bombs one after another, the sky and earth were shaking. The carts and vehicles were all bombed and destroyed. Those who barely survived also had little hope of being cured. At that time, a certain battalion of Weng's division also encountered a battle in front, unprepared, and retreated in a hurry, the situation was even more tragic. Under the willows at the station, there were several suitcases piled up, and two young women were sitting there, dressed fashionably, talking to each other. They said, "The special train fleeing from the Shanhaiguan Incident was full of officers' wives. Later, they learned from the telephone that the situation had returned to peace, and they returned to Changli. This time, our regimental commander (the younger one said) was originally defending the area east of the Luanhe Railway Bridge. He once said that if the railway bridge was bombed by the enemy, how would we cross the river? But in fact, it was not the case. Now the entire division has safely arrived at Leizhuang." The older one said, "If you are an officer to the rank of regimental commander, it is easy to be safe and promoted. The wife is really lucky." She smiled and said, "It's really annoying. What luck is there? Just like last night, the regimental commander was already tired and asleep, but the phone kept ringing. Sometimes I really couldn't bear to answer it. Zhang Xueliang has resigned, and there are still two months of salary that have not been paid. Recently, I heard that the authorities will set the salaries of military agency staff, starting from June. Generals will get 50% of 800 yuan, lieutenant generals will get 60% of 500 yuan, major generals will get 70% of 300 yuan, colonels will get 80% of 240 yuan, lieutenant colonels will get 90% of 170 yuan, majors will get 135 yuan, almost nothing. Captains will get 100%. There are so many tricks. Not to mention slightly reducing the percentage, I am only afraid that it will not be paid, then what will happen?" The reporter was very surprised, so he found a way to find out from her orderly that she was the second wife of the regimental commander of the 9th Brigade □□□ Regiment. The other, who considered herself inferior, was the wife of the director of a veterinary hospital. Both had to temporarily leave their husbands and go to Beiping first because of the tense situation. After a while, the delayed passenger train arrived, and they all rushed to board the train. The reporter also silently recited the slogans posted on the willows along the way: "Farmers should intensify cultivation to increase food," "The whole country should unite to mobilize and support the central government to resist the brutal Japanese," "Support Chairman Chiang, who is painstakingly responsible for resisting Japan and saving the country," "Do you know that ten Korean families share a kitchen knife? Do you know that the Japanese are confiscating civilian guns in the three northeastern provinces? Then you will understand the pain after the country is subjugated." He slowly walked out of the station and suddenly encountered Zhao and Wang from Northeast University, who came to participate in the anti-Japanese work, but because they were not approved by the authorities, they could not solve the food problem, so they had to take the train back to Ping in disappointment. Li, a student from Xiamen University, and Shi, a student from Yanjing University, who were working here as propagandists, were quite determined and had experienced many hardships. However, the food problem was also a constant problem. I record this to tell patriotic youths who want to come to serve that they should have proper contact in advance. (May 16)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Huang Fu Passes Through Jinan on His Way North <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>(Meeting with Han Fuju and Making a Statement)</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: At a time when the central government is preoccupied with the tense war situation at the front, it has established the North China Political Reorganization Committee, with Huang Fu as the chairman. After receiving the order, Huang exchanged views with various important figures in Shanghai on the reorganization of North China's politics. Recently, due to repeated telegrams from all sectors of Tianjin and Beijing urging him to come north, he took the Jinjing train from Shanghai to Beijing yesterday morning to pay respects to President Wang and ask for instructions. That night, he took the Pingpu train 202 north with He Qigong, Secretary-General of the Political Committee, and his entourage, He Jiecai, etc. Qiu Wei, Chairman of the Jinpu Railway Committee, specially reserved two cars for Huang. Qiu also planned to come north with Huang, but got off the train and returned to Beijing at the Citibank camp in Pukou due to some business. Because Huang was passing through Jinan midway, he had business to discuss with Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government. He had sent a telegram to Han in advance, so Han and Zhang Weicun, the Provincial Committee member, Wang Fangting, the Director of the Department of Industry, and Chai Dongsheng, the Director of the Salt Affairs Tax Police Bureau, all came to the station to welcome him. It is said that Huang served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 17th year of the Republic. He came to Jinan once during the May 3rd Massacre. This time, he passed through Jinan again, just as the war in western Luan was tense, and the situation in Tianjin and Beijing was critical. One could not help but feel emotional. The train arrived in Jinan at 6 PM. After the train stopped, Han boarded the train to meet with Huang. Then Han, Huang, He Qigong, and others got off the train together.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Talking to Reporters <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The reporter interviewed Huang at the station and made the following remarks. The reporter asked, "What is the chairman's mission this time?" Huang replied with a smile, "To reorganize North China's political affairs." The reporter asked, "At this critical time in North China, what good strategies does the chairman have to save the situation?" Huang replied, "This is not a simple question. Everyone must deliberate at length before a decision can be made." The reporter asked, "When can the North China Political Committee be formally established?" Huang replied, "There are more than 20 members of the Political Committee, who are still scattered in various places. Although I am responsible for reorganizing North China's political affairs, I must wait until all the members have arrived before I can plan and proceed." After the conversation, Han Fuju, Huang Fu, and He Qigong took a car to the provincial government together, and the welcoming staff also followed. After arriving at the provincial government, they had a lively discussion on everything in Han's office.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Answering Three Questions <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The reporter visited Huang again at the provincial government, and Huang sent his secretary, He Jiecai, to meet with the reporter on his behalf. The reporter asked three questions, which He answered on behalf of the reporter as follows: (1) "At this critical time in North China, does the central government have any new measures?" He replied, "When the chairman was about to leave Beijing yesterday, the reporters in Beijing also asked this question. However, because the matter is important, I was unable to give a definite answer. But today's situation in North China, although it cannot be said to be very optimistic, is absolutely not pessimistic. Now the people of North China are flocking south. The chairman has been ordered in times of crisis and resolutely took office and came north. There will definitely be a way. The chairman had a long conversation with President Wang yesterday when he was about to leave Beijing. The content is not convenient to disclose yet." "What is the chairman's mission when he sees Chairman Han in Jinan?" He replied, "Shandong is a part of North China, and Chairman Han is also a member of the North China Political Committee. The affairs of North China are all related to Shandong, so the chairman has something to discuss with Chairman Han. Furthermore, Chairman Han is the highest-ranking official in a province. When passing through this place, he must of course get off the train to show respect. There is also the fact that Chairman Huang and Chairman Han of this province have a teacher-student relationship, and Mr. He (Qigong) and Chairman Han are also former comrades-in-arms. After many years of separation, they also want to meet and reminisce." (3) "What is the policy direction after the establishment of the Political Committee?" He replied, "The North China Political Committee is an affiliated agency of the Executive Yuan and will of course follow the policy direction of the Executive Yuan. The jurisdiction of the Political Committee is Shandong, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces, and Beijing City."</p>

They talked and laughed happily during the banquet. After the meal at 9 PM, Huang and He went to the station. Han Fuju, Wang Fangting, and Chai Dongsheng, etc., all went to the station to see them off. The Jinpu Railway Bureau had prepared a special train for Huang in Jinan in advance. Huang boarded the train and bid farewell to the farewell party one by one. At 9:40 PM, the train left Jinan for Beiping. Wang Kemin, a member of the North China Political Committee, also passed through Jinan yesterday on his way to Beiping. (May 17)</p>

<p>The Young Daughter Died and the Coffin Was Opened for Examination</p>
<p>In the 541st Tu of the 5th District of the county, in the Northwest Tang area, the death of A Rong, daughter of Wang Erquan, a villager, was unclear. There were various rumors outside, saying that she was injured in a rape attempt, or that she was injured by a fall due to fright. Zhou Erkai, the chief prosecutor of the county court, out of caution for human life, brought along the examining officer and others to the village to open the coffin for examination yesterday (the 18th). The examination revealed that the girl had a kick injury on her back, a bump injury on her forehead and left knee, and a punch injury on her right rib. It was indeed an injury sustained before death, which caused her illness and death the next day. After the examination, Wang Erquan was instructed to re-coffin and bury her and await further investigation.</p>

<p>Yan Shenyu, the magistrate of this county, has been in office for more than a month and is making every effort to rectify officialdom. The other day, Magistrate Yan was informed by Wu Dexin, the chief of the County Public Security Bureau, that Zhu Niansheng, the chief of the Second Branch Bureau of Public Security, had committed many misdeeds. He concealed and did not report cases of violations of police regulations and embezzled fines. He requested that he be dealt with according to the law. After receiving the report, Yan immediately ordered Jin Shiqi, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, to summon Zhu Niansheng to the county. Magistrate Yan personally interrogated him. Zhu's confession was vague, only admitting that he had failed to supervise. Magistrate Yan then additionally summoned Wu Xiqing and Sun Shizhao, two employees of the branch bureau, to the county for questioning. As a result, Magistrate Yan personally ordered Zhu Niansheng to be removed from office and investigated, and handed him over to Inspector Jin for custody. Wu Xiqing and Sun Shizhao were detained. Yesterday (the 18th), he prepared a document and transferred Zhu and the other three to the county court for interrogation.</p>

Unexpectedly, on the night of the 16th, more than 20 bandits suddenly came, climbed over the wall and broke into the inner room. They immediately tied up Shi's two daughters-in-law with ropes, and then tortured Shi's wife, burning her lower body with fire. They searched and robbed for about three hours. The bandits guarding the wind also fired guns to intimidate. They left at dawn. On the morning of the 17th, the owner reported to the township district office, which has been transferred to the county to order the arrest of the stolen goods.</p>

The fixed amount is 500,000 yuan. Each silk merchant who has 40,000 yuan can find a guarantor to borrow 60,000 yuan from the loan group. The term is three months, and the interest is calculated at one cent and one li. Everything is handled by the borrower. The Farmers Bank can only lend to rural cooperatives because it is restricted by provincial and ministerial departments, so it did not join the loan group.</p>

<p>Surveying the Airport on the Ping-Hu Line</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications decided that airplanes on the Pinghu line should return to Shanghai from Haizhou. When they flew over the Nantong River, they encountered fog. If they flew over, there might be an accident. It would be a long journey to return to Haizhou. Therefore, it was decided to set up an airport in Nantong and build a radio station. On the 17th, the ministry sent a technical assistant, Yu Shipai, to survey the airport with County Magistrate Ye. It was decided to take over the 400-mu grassland in the Tangzha area. The grassland is named Shiwandang and a map has been drawn and sent back to Beijing for approval.</p>

<p>Bandits Urge Ransom and Set Fire to Meat Tickets</p>
<p>Hongtao, the son of Yang Guozeng, a farmer in Jiangjiaxia, the ninth district of the county, was kidnapped by bandits last month. There has been no news of him so far. In the evening of the day before yesterday (14th), more than 20 bandits came to Yang's house again, twisted Guozeng and told him to first raise 1,000 yuan and send it to Sanlang Temple to get his son back. The remaining 1,000 yuan would be taken by someone after the autumn harvest. If he failed to do so, they would burn down the entire village, killing everyone, including chickens and dogs. When the bandits were about to leave, they set fire to the grass stacks in each house, fired their guns and fled.</p>

<p>Salt Industry Disputes Rise Again</p>
<p>The salt industry association here believes that the commission earned by more than 1,000 salt merchants in more than 50 salt firms in the whole city is too low, making it difficult to maintain a livelihood. It was agreed that an additional eight cents would be added to the original commission of one jiao and two fen per dan of salt. Lu Jianzhai and 20 other merchants believed that the salt firms had increased the commission without authorization, increasing the burden on the people. They strongly opposed it and filed lawsuits with governments at all levels and the 　 official office, requesting to stop the levy in order to relieve the people's suffering. After the Anhui provincial government explicitly banned it, the firms only collected five cents. Lu and others believed that the tax inspection association had illegally collected more than 10,000 yuan in the past month or so and should hand it over in full for local public welfare. The salt industry associations did not believe that they had illegally collected so much and signed and handed over 2,000 yuan. Lu and others still went ahead and requested that they be recovered. It was required that all be handed over. Now a certain 　　 is mediating and negotiating. It is heard that the salt industry is complaining to governments at all levels and the salt affairs competent official office that the commission earned by themselves is too little and is actually restricted by the North Salt Public Business Office, pleading for the abolition of the office, and will not stop until the goal is achieved. It seems that there will be a major dispute in the salt case here again.</p>

<h3 id="e105">International Radio Station and Mackay Company Announce <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>An Additional Set of Lines Between China and the United States Scheduled to Open Today</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications and the Mackay Radio Telegraph Company have been planning to communicate with each other for some time. It is now learned that the two parties have agreed to start communicating today. From now on, a new set of lines will be added to the world's communication network, bringing China and the rest of the world closer and making news more accessible. At a time when countries around the world are paying attention to events in the Far East, it is particularly thought-provoking that the new lines are starting to communicate. The service contract signed between the Ministry of Communications and the Mackay Company allows the Ministry's existing international radio stations to communicate with the company's San Francisco radio stations. The company is part of the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, which has agencies for operating and managing wired telegraphs and telephones in various regions of the world. The most famous of these are Mackay Radio Telegraph Company, which specializes in transatlantic business between Europe and the United States, Commercial Cable Company, which specializes in all-American Telegraph Company between North America, South America, and the West Indies, and Postal Telegraph Company.</p>
<p>The history of the Mackay Company can be traced back to 1910, when wireless telegraph was created to compete with landline business. The operator was the American Federal Radio Telegraph Company, which established radio stations in major cities in the United States. Later, due to restrictions by the US government, it was only allowed to conduct commercial communications along the Pacific coast. The company's famous directional radio stations were established at this time. In 1917, the US government temporarily nationalized the company's stations because it joined the European War. In order to maintain its business, the company had to transmit its communications by wire, but because the efficiency of wire was far less than that of wireless, the company still engaged in the construction of wireless radio stations after the end of the European War in 1920. Since then, the business has developed day by day and has attracted the attention of the Postal Telegraph Company. In October of the same year, Mackay, the manager of the Postal Telegraph Company, devised a way to purchase the company's wireless part, and the Mackay Radio Telegraph Company was established at this time. Since then, Mackay Company began to build its international radio station in San Francisco to communicate with Honolulu and the Philippines, and the radio stations surpassing the Pacific Ocean were also completed at this time. In 1929, Mackay Company merged with the International Telephone and Telegraph Company again. Since returning to international company management, Mackay Company's business has become more and more prosperous. In the beginning, it could only conduct directional communications along the Pacific coast, but now it has trans-Atlantic circuits directly to Europe between Europe and the United States, and circuits to Cuba, Peru, Argentina, Corombu, and the West Indies in South America. On the Pacific side, there are radio stations in San Francisco, Honolulu, and the Philippines. Now the Ministry of Communications and the company have started to communicate with each other, and a new circuit has been opened in the Pacific Ocean. Telegrams sent from Shanghai to the eastern United States can be transmitted to New York via San Francisco, and telegrams sent to various regions in South America can also be forwarded via New York. If communications between China and the United States develop in the future, it will be easy to open a direct circuit from Shanghai to New York. Although Mackay Company and Postal Telegraph Company are separate organizations, they are jointly operated on the transmission and reception of communications. Postal Telegraph Company has as many as 70,000 communication agencies in the United States. The two companies are both under the management of the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, so there is no need to borrow other people's routes for transmission and reception, and the transmission is naturally faster.</p>
<p>From China's perspective, communicating with Mackay Company not only increases the country's income, but also opens up a new set of lines, which can increase international traffic and prevent the monopoly of other companies. The benefits are indeed many.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Rumors of Two Northern Compromise Conditions <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Expresses Hope for Realization</p>
<p>New Voice Agency reports that yesterday's British newspaper North China Daily News reported that the Sino-Japanese military issue in the north has been resolved. Under two conditions, namely (1) both sides understand that if the Chinese army stays south of the Luan River, the Japanese army will withdraw to outside the Great Wall; (2) do not encourage or supply the Volunteer Army to disrupt "Manchukuo." The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy denied this when talking to a reporter from the New Voice Agency who visited yesterday, but believed that these conditions could be accepted by the Japanese military. However, this compromise may not be so rapid. This is because the attitudes of both China and Japan are now quite tough, and it is not easy to make their opinions gradually converge. But it is believed that both sides may compromise under these conditions. However, on the other hand, Huang Fu, the newly appointed chairman of the North China Political Reorganization Committee, has denied the compromise business, and Huang has also declared that he will never sign any agreement. Also, some Japanese soldiers have advocated an extremely tough attitude. Although Huang is a person who is insightful about the situation in Japan and has a fairly good relationship with Japan, under these circumstances, the saying of compromise seems to be slim. However, in terms of realistic situations, there is a slight turning point in the north. Since Huang arrived in Ping, Huang has said that he will seek a temporary peace solution under mutual understanding. It can be imagined that the realization of a disguised compromise is only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Held separately by the City Party Headquarters and the Lake Society</p>
<p>May 18th is the anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Chen Ying Shi, a martyr of the Nationalist Party. The City Party Headquarters of this city convened people from all walks of life at 9:00 am to hold the 17th Anniversary Memorial Meeting for the Martyrdom of Mr. Chen Ying Shi. Members of the Lake Society also held a public memorial ceremony at the Ying Shi Memorial Hall on Guizhou Road. The details of the memorial meeting and the public memorial ceremony are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e108">Memorial at the Party Headquarters <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Order of the Meeting: (1) Opening; (2) Singing the Party Song; (3) Paying the highest respect to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of the Premier; (4) The Chairman respectfully reading the Premier's Will; (5) Silent tribute for three minutes in memory of the Martyr Chen Ying Shi; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Speeches; (8) Shouting slogans; (9) Conclusion.</p>
<p>Attendees: Zheng Letian of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Xie Baochen of the Postal Administration, Zhang Mengling of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Pan Rongting of the South Shanghai District Farmers' Association, Shao Xubai of the General Labour Union, Liu Yongkang of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Lu Muqin of the Pharmaceutical Trade Association, Zhu Chengdong of the First District Rubber Industry Union, Jiang Xiangcai of the Qin Industry Union, Wei Dongshan of the Pig Industry Union, Fan Guoren of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, Liu Pingji of the Women's Suffrage Association, Hu Xiongting of Jiaotong University, Jingye Middle School, Huadong Middle School, Junyi Middle School, Shihua, Longde, Bide, Feihong, and other primary schools, as well as representatives from various district party headquarters and branches, and all staff members of the City Party Headquarters, more than 300 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Pan Gongzhan reported, briefly stating that seventeen years ago, on this day, Mr. Chen Ying Shi, a martyr of our party, was ambushed by Yuan Shikai's henchmen at his residence on Sapo Sai Road in this city. Mr. Ying Shi's revolutionary spirit is known to all. Mr. Ying Shi participated in the revolution and sacrificed himself for the revolution. What we admire most about him is the spirit of obedience and hard work. What Mr. Ying Shi obeyed was the revolutionary doctrine and the orders of the revolutionary leader. What Mr. Ying Shi worked hard at was the revolutionary cause. Mr. Ying Shi went to Japan eight years before the founding of the Republic of China, joined the Tongmenghui, followed Sun Yat-sen, planned the revolution, and took on difficult tasks. During the uprisings in various places in 1911, Mr. Ying Shi personally participated in the secret planning. After the Wuhan Uprising, he gathered comrades in Shanghai and took the lead in responding, recovering Shanghai, serving as the military governor of Shanghai, assisting the allied forces of various provinces, laying the foundation for the southeast, and promoting unification. However, when we recall the difficulties Mr. Ying Shi encountered when he launched the revolution in Shanghai, it is impossible to express them in a few words. Mr. Ying Shi disregarded everything and sacrificed himself for the revolution with his spirit of hard work. In the end, Mr. Ying Shi's ability to cope recovered Shanghai. Since the founding of the Republic of China, Mr. Ying Shi has always followed Sun Yat-sen, taking the Premier's will as his will and striving for revolution. Mr. Ying Shi only knew obedience to the Premier. Today, when we commemorate Mr. Ying Shi, we should deeply recognize his spirit of obedience and hard work. When we look at the current disorganization of our party's organization and the abandonment of discipline, and the increasingly deteriorating situation, which has led to the country's increasingly declining fortunes, some people believe that the current crisis in China cannot be saved by our party alone and that we need to unite with other factions. This is due to the reduction of self-confidence. We can certainly see the difficulties encountered in the past revolutionary efforts in China, or even worse than today, but the revolutionary patriots of our party will eventually break through this difficult situation. Therefore, what we need today is to hope that all party comrades can follow Mr. Ying Shi's spirit of obedience and hard work, then our party can still restore the revolutionary atmosphere of the past and have a day of revival.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans: (1) Mr. Chen Ying Shi is a believer in the Three Principles of the People; (2) Mr. Chen Ying Shi is a pioneer in resisting feudal remnants; (3) To commemorate Mr. Chen Ying Shi, we must work hard to suppress bandits and resist Japan; (4) The spirit of Mr. Chen Ying Shi is immortal; (5) Long live the Republic of China; (6) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party; (7) Long live the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Chen Pagoda Opens: The Chen Ying Shi Memorial Pagoda in Ximen, after the municipal government allocated funds for its construction and completion, stands tall and magnificent. The pagoda gate is usually tightly closed, and citizens are not allowed to enter. Later, it was stipulated that it would be open for one day every year on Mr. Ying Shi's memorial day for public viewing. Yesterday, it was opened from 9:00 am, and many citizens climbed the pagoda. Last night, the retro-reflective lights installed on the poles around the pagoda were turned on to illuminate the top of the pagoda, so that citizens could admire it.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Public Memorial Ceremony at the Lake Society <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Order of the Public Memorial Ceremony: (1) Opening; (2) Playing mourning music; (3) Singing the Party Song; (4) Paying the highest respect to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of the Premier; (5) The Chairman respectfully reading the Premier's Will; (6) Silent tribute for three minutes; (7) Public memorial ceremony: (A) Offering flowers, (B) Bowing three times, (C) Reading the memorial text, (D) Singing the elegy; (8) Reporting on the deeds of the martyr and the circumstances of his death; (9) Speeches; (10) Family expresses gratitude; (11) Playing mourning music; (12) Conclusion.</p>
<p>Mourning Situation: The meeting opened at 10:00 am. Chairman Tang Jicang conducted the ceremony as required. The chief celebrant, Wang Yiting, offered flowers, Shen Tianxin read the memorial text, and the students of Ying Shi Primary School sang the elegy. Then, the chairman reported on the deeds of the martyr and the circumstances of his death. Afterwards, Pan Gongzhan, the representative of the City Party Headquarters, delivered a speech. Finally, the Chen family expressed their gratitude and the meeting concluded.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Tang Jicang reported, briefly stating that everyone present was probably familiar with Mr. Chen Gong Ying Shi's deeds and the circumstances of his death and there was no need to repeat them. At today's public memorial ceremony, it was felt that the participants were all young people. Young people are the pillars of the country and will surely continue the unfinished ambitions of the martyrs and jointly plan the national affairs. When Mr. Chen was alive, he was brave in seeing things and doing things, and he never gave up despite setbacks, which led to his tragic death. However, although Mr. Chen is dead, his great spirit still exists and is a model for our young people, and so on.</p>
<p>Contract for Rebuilding the North Railway Station</p>
<h3 id="e110">Officially Signed the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>

<p>Will Voluntarily Donate Rent</p>
<p>To Provide Aviation Funds</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Aviation Association launched the fundraising for the National Aviation Salvation Fund, it has been two months, but it has not yet reached the original goal. Therefore, some citizens suggested to the Municipal Government to collect one month's rent to provide aviation funds. The Dagong Daily reporter specially visited Mr. Lin Wo Jiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, yesterday to inquire about his opinions. According to his statement, the Japanese invaders are invading our country, relying entirely on the air force. Since there are no airplanes in the country to fight, Japanese aircraft are allowed to ravage and threaten us. Therefore, what China urgently needs to pay attention to at present is aviation and air defense. The launch of the Aviation Association is to seek to strengthen the capabilities of air defense. The fundraising this time was originally set at 2 million yuan, but most of those who actively contributed were ordinary workers and coolies, or small business merchants, while the wealthy refused to contribute a single cent, so the mere amount of 2 million yuan has not yet been achieved. It is very painful to say this. Now citizens are submitting petitions to the Mayor one after another, proposing to collect one month's rent from the whole city to be used as aviation funds. The Municipal Government is currently assessing it. I believe that up to this day, all Chinese people should not be living in a drunken dream. We must know that if the country exists, the people exist. If the country is destroyed, we will all perish together. I hope that all landlords in the city will voluntarily rise up and donate to strengthen national defense, he said.</p>

<p>Newspaper Association</p>
<h3 id="e113">Hosted Mr. Martin Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Association hosted Dr. William Martin, the former chief writer of the Geneva Newspaper, at noon yesterday at the East Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao. Zhao Tiezhang, section chief of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guo Dehua, secretary of the Finance Department's Shanghai Office, and Mr. Xie Fusheng were also invited to accompany them. More than 20 people attended, including Zhang Yunhe and Ma Yinliang from Shen Bao, Wang Boqi and Wang Zhongwei from Xinwen Bao, Xiong Shaohao and Xiang Yuancun from Shishi Xinbao, and He Xiya and Qian Cangshuo from Chen Bao and Min Bao. After the banquet, Mr. Zhang Yunhe presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech, followed by Mr. Martin's reply and a speech on "Geneva's Observation of the Sino-Japanese Dispute," which was translated by Mr. Xie Fusheng. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 pm. The welcome speech, reply speech, and speech are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Chairman's Welcome Speech <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>We are extremely honored that Mr. Martin has honored us with his presence today and gathered with our colleagues. Mr. Martin is the famous chief writer of the Geneva Newspaper, the center of world opinion, and Geneva is also the location of the conference that presides over the fair trial of the Far East Sino-Japanese issue. The Far East issue has been discussed at the conference many times, and Mr. Martin has personally heard and witnessed it. Therefore, the opinions published in the newspaper can be fair and not be misled by the Japanese side's one-sided propaganda. Japanese imperialism is taking advantage of the world's troubles and using its new weapons such as airplanes to put pressure on us. Now it has even invaded Pingjin. It is undeniable that our country is weak and cannot resist it, but we dare to be confident that we will never succumb in the end and will eventually seek self-salvation through our own efforts. Therefore, we do not dare to excessively hope that the League of Nations will provide any assistance. We only hope that the League of Nations will abide by its charter and handle the matter thoroughly and fairly. At the same time, we also hope that Mr. Martin can use his authority to guide world opinion, judge the right and wrong of the Sino-Japanese issue, and fully publicize all the atrocities of the Japanese warlords, so that all countries in the world can understand the truth. The light of world peace depends on this, which is what we all hope for. Now, please join me in a toast to Mr. Martin's health and ask him to enlighten us.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Mr. Martin's Reply <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Fellow comrades, I am deeply grateful for the grand banquet hosted by the Shanghai Newspaper Association today. I personally feel that this gathering can be called a meal for colleagues, which has a profound meaning. As a European journalist, I have many purposes for coming to China this time, but the most important one is to visit your country and get close to your people to exchange ideas. When I was in Geneva, I often felt that hearing about the situation in your country was not as good as seeing it with my own eyes. This time, I came to China in person and was very happy and honored to have a meal with my colleagues in the Chinese press.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Mr. Martin's Speech <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>In addition to sightseeing, I intend to use a method to make Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations effective. I have been in Geneva for eighteen months. Although the region is small, it has a great impact on the world, because important people from all over the world often gather here to discuss major issues in order to solve everything. The Geneva Daily, which I run in Geneva, does not have a large circulation due to the small area and population, but most important people like to read the newspaper and often use the newspaper's remarks as a source of conversation. This is because the newspaper's remarks have always been fair. In Geneva, I am also striving for fairness and justice. If world justice can be maintained, then the Sino-Japanese dispute will be easily resolved fairly. I have always had extremely friendly feelings towards your country, but I am not very clear about the situation in your country. Initially, the representatives sent by your country to Geneva were very few, and no major issues occurred. When the September 18th Incident occurred, I wanted to investigate the truth of the case, so I went to the Japanese consulate to visit Saito and asked him to explain everything, but what he said was not something I dared to believe. Therefore, I still maintained my consistent position and spoke out for justice, which caused displeasure from the Japanese side. Because my view on the September 18th Incident has expanded the issue and made it a world peace issue, not just a dispute between China and Japan. This not only exposed Japan's weakness, but I firmly believe that justice will prevail one day. As for what the chairman said that China will never succumb and is determined to resist to the end, I feel very happy to hear it. I dare to predict that your country, with this determination, will be the creator of justice prevailing over power in the near future.</p>

<p>They Will Arrive Today</p>
<p>The 30 family members of the generals of Li Du's troops, the commander-in-chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, retreated into Russia with General Li Du. They then returned to China via Vladivostok and temporarily resided in Beiping. Because Pingjin was in danger, no one took care of them, and there were problems with food and lodging. They had no choice but to leave Beiping for Shanghai the night before last, led by Madam Xie Yiqing, the wife of Li Du. It is expected that they will arrive in Shanghai this evening. Liu Piguang, Li Du's representative in Shanghai, contacted various groups yesterday to discuss the accommodation and food issues for the family members of Li's troops after they arrived in Shanghai. As for General Li Du's arrival in Shanghai in early June, the troops of Li's troops who arrived in Xinjiang decided to stay in Xinjiang Province and wait for the government to reorganize them before guarding the border. There are still 30,000 troops of Li's troops remaining in Jilin, and they are still continuing their activities.</p>

<p>Around 12 o'clock the night before last, a traveler arrived at the Qinghe Hotel, number 181, Qinghefang Alley, Wuma Road, Zhejiang Road. He claimed to be a local named Miao Fengyi, 21 years old, a businessman. It is unknown why, but he had thoughts of suicide and ingested raw opium. The next morning around 12 o'clock, the tea attendant knocked on the door, but there was no response, which was quite strange. So, he found a way to pry the door open and saw Miao lying stiff on the bed, having been dead for a long time. He immediately notified the accounting office and reported to the police station, who ordered detectives to the scene to carry the body to Renji Hospital and then to the morgue for examination.</p>

They were later taken to Renji Hospital by carriage for treatment.</p>

<p>Zhou Xunfu, a Ningbo native who used to run a foreign goods business and lived at number 13, Sanyi Lane, Bail'er Road, in the French Concession, had insured his property for 1,000 taels with the Hua'an Insurance Company last year. Recently, due to unemployment and boredom, he plotted to obtain insurance compensation. On the morning of the 28th of last month, at 2 a.m., while his housemate was asleep, he used a lighter and a handkerchief to set a fire. Then, he and his wife fled. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade. Chief Detective Tao Desheng and Detective Bao Jinrong of the French Concession police investigated and arrested Zhou, transferring him to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. The details of the interrogation were recorded in previous reports. The case was subsequently investigated by Judge Wang Gangxu, head of the criminal court, who personally inspected the scene. The trial has concluded, and yesterday, Judge Wang sentenced Zhou Xunfu to three years and six months of imprisonment for the crime of arson and destruction of a currently used residence. The defendant, upon hearing the verdict, declared in court that he was not satisfied and requested an appeal. The court granted the request and ordered him to be remanded to the detention center pending further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Chinese Workers Demand Back Wages from Japanese <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Shun Pao Telegraph Agency Local News: The Japanese military barracks on Jiangwan Road were destroyed by our army's artillery fire during the January 28th Incident. The Japanese side specially rebuilt a large-scale barracks on the original site last winter. For several months, it has not been completed. The construction project was contracted by the Ogura Construction Company of Japan, which hired more than 40 Japanese workers to be responsible for wood piles, steel bars, and other projects, and 800 laborers, specializing in transporting materials and other odd jobs. More than 100 workers were recruited from Qingdao to be responsible for the construction of the interior layout project. Later, due to the busy work, the original workers were not enough, so they entrusted the Japanese Matsumoto Ueo,</p>
<p>Who in turn entrusted Chinese Qian Jinbao and others to hire more than 100 Chinese workers. The wages for each person per day were divided into several types: one yuan, five jiao, and three jiao, etc. After starting work, the workers initially were able to receive wages according to the original agreement, but soon Matsumoto was in arrears, paying only half of the wages. To date, the amount owed has been very large. Last month, Matsumoto received 3,600 yuan in wages from Ogura, but did not pay a penny to the Chinese workers. The workers felt that Matsumoto had embezzled their hard-earned wages for his own benefit, and they expressed their unwillingness to continue working. Matsumoto was very embarrassed, so he negotiated with the workers, willing to provide them with rice every day in lieu of wages, and promised</p>
<p>To raise funds and pay back wages. The workers then agreed to resume work. Recently, Ogura, believing that Matsumoto's contracting of the construction project was progressing slowly, intended to terminate the contract with Matsumoto and contract it out to someone else. At the same time, they ordered more than 100 Chinese workers to stop working. The workers, since the work was stopped, wanted to settle the arrears with Matsumoto. After several contacts, Matsumoto had not given a definite answer. The workers, unwilling to let Matsumoto</p>
<p>Embezzle their hard-earned wages, specially gathered more than 100 workers at around 10 a.m. yesterday at Matsumoto Ueo's residence at number 29, Qiuzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road, to negotiate. They elected Wan Chengsheng and more than 10 others as representatives to meet with Matsumoto and demand wages, while the others sat on the ground in the lane and waited. The Fifth District Third Police Station, fearing that the crowd would cause trouble, sent translator Chen, along with the police chief and others, to the scene to suppress the situation,</p>
<p>To mediate. At the same time, the Fifth District Police Station also sent translator Li with police to assist in questioning Matsumoto. Negotiations continued until noon, when Matsumoto finally agreed to find a way to raise funds and pay the arrears. However, the workers insisted on a settlement at that time. After repeated persuasion and guidance by the two translators, Chen and Li, Matsumoto finally agreed to first distribute several bags of rice to the workers and then find a way to raise the remaining amount. At this point, the workers agreed to postpone the settlement temporarily.</p>

<p>The Huacun Temple in Nanshou, Hongqiao Town, West Shanghai, suddenly saw a total of 220 male and female refugees from Hunan Province arrive the day before yesterday. They are temporarily living in the temple and have been there for five days. However, there are too few houses and too many people, resulting in overcrowding. In the past two days, the refugees have been forming groups, going to nearby villages, asking for donations from house to house, and arbitrarily catching chickens and ducks, and stealing broad beans from the fields. The villagers, unable to bear the disturbance, rushed to report to the Hongqiao Town Police Station of the First Branch of the Sixth District, requesting that the police be dispatched to drive them away. Upon receiving the report, Police Chief Pan Xuezeng immediately led all armed police to the scene to suppress the situation and ordered the entire team to leave the country within two hours, prohibiting them from staying to avoid disturbances.</p>

<p>Organizing a Committee to Promote the Use of National Products</p>
<p>Starting with Members' Clothing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, in view of the profound national crisis and the urgency of foreign troubles, believes that promoting national products is an essential strategy for saving the country. Therefore, the executive committee of the union resolved to organize a committee to promote the use of national products, starting with the adoption of national products for members' clothing, and gradually promoting other daily necessities. Fan Caicong and six others were appointed as committee members to actively carry out the plan.

<p>Savings &amp; Remittance Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e138">Focus of the Merger Issue <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Ministry Side: Formulate separate regulations for appointment of savings &amp; remittance employees</p>
<p>Labor Side: Must pass exams to be included in the postal service's regular ranks</p>
<p>The issue of merging the Savings &amp; Remittance Bureau has been discussed in several meetings by the Postal Economic System Research Committee. Starting from May 10th, three consecutive meetings were held to discuss it in detail, and there are generally no more problems. The focus of the dispute is how to deal with the current employees of the Savings &amp; Remittance Bureau at all levels. According to the responsible committee members of the labor and employee unions, the Ministry's representative believes that separate methods of appointment should be formulated in accordance with the inherent rules and regulations of the post office. According to the views of the employees, since the Savings &amp; Remittance Bureau is merged into the General Post Office, its organization should be unified. If the Ministry insists on formulating separate regulations, it is tantamount to making the Savings &amp; Remittance Bureau independent. Moreover, some of the current employees of the bureau have been transferred from the post office. If separate regulations are formulated in the future, which regulations will govern the various benefits, etc., of the post office personnel serving in the bureau? The current employees of the Savings &amp; Remittance Bureau at all levels lack a clear standard for staying or leaving, and their career prospects are inevitably affected. Yesterday afternoon, the labor and employee unions held an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees. Regarding this issue, they instructed the representatives attending the Postal Research Committee meeting today to insist on: (1) passing a screening examination; (2) being included in the postal service ranks; (3) receiving the same treatment as postal personnel. If this issue cannot be resolved, the representatives may announce their withdrawal at any time.</p>

<p>The Reorganization Committee of the Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai yesterday sent telegrams to Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, Cai Tingkai, and others, which read: "To Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan of Guangzhou, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai Jiansheng of Nanning, and Commander-in-Chief Cai Tingkai of Fuzhou, with respect: The violent Japanese are invading, and the foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent. The communist bandits are rampant, and the internal troubles have not ended. To pacify the interior and resist foreign aggression, the central government has the determination, but the local governments should share the responsibility. Otherwise, the soldiers will be exhausted internally, and the enemy will be emboldened externally. The fate of the country is unbearable to imagine. You are leading the troops and serving as the bulwark of the country. The central government has entrusted you with the important responsibility of suppressing the communists. Taking office and setting out is the deep expectation of the people. We urge you to take office as soon as possible and shoulder the great hardship of resisting Japan. Do not hesitate or decline again, delaying the troops for resisting Japan. Then, the country will be revitalized through adversity, which will not be far away. Protecting the country and eliminating tyranny, the merits will be equal. At this critical moment, please do not hesitate. We anxiously await your response. The Reorganization Committee of the Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai, respectfully."</p>

<h3 id="e143">Dr. Fu Youren's Lecture <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Last Sunday, Dr. Fu Youren continued his lecture on "The Resurrection of China," Part II, "The China of the Past," stating that the fundamental causes of China's current predicament can be divided into three categories: (1) the ancient influence of climate and geography, which cultivated a habit of easily relating the body to matter and the spirit to difficulty; (2) the old principles of China, which originated in the north and later spread to the central and southern regions, relying on memory for their dissemination. The danger of memory is that it prevents the true use of the brain; the third cause is the combination of the first two, namely, the first two causes make the Chinese feel a decline in strength.

<p>The home of Zhu Xinquan, who runs a pawnshop business at No. 136, Jinxing Lane, north of Pishao Nai Road, Glock Road, in the French Concession, was suddenly visited by four or five robbers at noon the day before yesterday. They entered through the back door under the pretext of asking for a letter, and threatened with pistols. They ransacked the boxes and chests, stealing cash and jewelry worth more than 2,000 yuan, and fled in a crowd. It was found that Zhu's home was also robbed once in February last year, and Zhu's neighbors on both sides were also robbed one after another last year, suffering huge losses. The reason why robberies often occur in that area is that there are no police patrols, which emboldens the robbers to dare to commit robberies in broad daylight. It is now heard that the victim has issued a list of losses and reported to the police station, requesting a strict investigation and arrest in order to crack down on the bandits and reassure the people.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Mr. Zhang Naiqi's Views on the Future of Sino-Japanese Relations <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Lecture at the YMCA on May 12th</p>
<p>When we study any social problem, we cannot escape examining its cause-and-effect relationship. We can only speculate on its future results if we know its past causes. The same is true when studying the Sino-Japanese problem. Let me start with the Japanese side:</p>
<p>First, aren't we always talking about examining a country's national character? A country's national character is neither good nor bad; it is only the result of being dominated by the environment. The reason why the Japanese national character is tough is due to their territory! Only four islands! Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Hokkaido, with an area of only 380,000 square kilometers (more than 23,000 square miles). After the Meiji Restoration, the introduction of Western culture further strengthened their weapons of plunder abroad, and they began to use all their strength to attack the weak nations nearby.</p>
<p>From 1874 (the 13th year of Tongzhi), they invaded Taiwan, then destroyed Ryukyu and changed it to Okinawa Prefecture; in 1895 (the 21st year of Guangxu), in the Sino-Japanese War, our country failed, and Japan carried out the seizure of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands; after the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, Japan won again, occupied the Liaodong Peninsula, and established the Kwantung Leased Territory; soon after, it reduced Korea; and then the Twenty-One Demands; the Shanghai Incident; the Jinan Massacre; and the recent September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident are all a continuous and consistent history of aggression. They have set their sights on the route, advancing north and south, with no disorder in their steps.</p>
<p>The cause of the September 18th Incident was the world economic panic, which produced a recession; the recession phenomenon spread around the globe. The fatal wound of capitalism lies in overproduction; overproduction leads to lower prices, increased unemployment, and social unrest; this is a natural trend. Japan, of course, could not escape this example. There was a left-right ideological commotion in the country, social unrest, and the Japanese government launched an attack on Shenyang. Economically, they could occupy all or part of Manchuria as a resource; politically, they could shift the eyes of the people outward to alleviate their own contradictions. This result led the Japanese from Liaoning to Jilin to Heilongjiang to Jehol, and recently they have even attempted to seize Beiping and Tianjin!</p>
<p>But again, we have to say that we ourselves are not good. Before the September 18th Incident, the Japanese intentionally or unintentionally hinted, such as the change of the Governor-General of Korea and the Governor-General of the South Manchuria Railway, the Wanbaoshan Incident, and the massacre of Chinese in Korea, all had the appearance of "a storm is brewing." Why didn't our government feel it? All because they were concentrating on their "internal pacification" work!</p>
<p>Now let's talk about why we don't resist. 1. The source of our country's finances is mainly customs duties and tobacco taxes, and its foundation is built on the treaty ports. If war is declared, the treaty ports may be blockaded. And the source of finance will be cut off. Then, in order to survive, we can only surrender and be slaughtered.</p>
<p>2. The current era is the era of colonial anti-imperialist movements, and the power of the anti-imperialist movement is very great. In a certain sense, it is enough to change our country's foreign policy to a policy of non-resistance.</p>
<p>So where is our way out in the future?</p>
<p>Now our only way out is to "fight," and there is no other way to go. My reasons for advocating fighting are: (1) Declaring war on the enemy will surely cause the country to focus its attention outward and no longer kill each other; (2) Declaring war on Japan is in line with the times. We know that the present era is the era of colonial anti-imperialism, and our country is one of the members of this anti-imperialist camp, and therefore our country cannot escape its responsibility and should meet it head-on!</p>
<p>From the enemy's point of view, the current Japanese invasion is accelerating the destruction of the rural economy; the collapse of the social and economic organization is becoming more thorough, which means that the objective conditions for the Chinese revolution are becoming more mature and urgent, forcing China to be pushed onto the path of revolution. At this time, if anyone dares to go against the times and advocate compromise, they will surely become the target of the revolution. The revolutionary masses should be 85% workers and peasants; they are unwilling to live under parasites anymore, and the environment is driving them to embark on the road of anti-imperialist vanguard. They have indeed been exploited enough, and they will never see the light unless they come out and overthrow their oppressors themselves.</p>
<p>However, if our country's revolutionary movement is launched, it will not be welcomed by the international capitalist imperialists. What they hope for is "don't move," and let them slaughter us. Sucking the marrow after the blood is exhausted! If our country revolts, we will not be favored by them. Our country's construction and the implementation of socialism and nationalism are not good for them. Their purpose is to call on us to compromise with them in order to maintain peace and protect the market, but we want to prolong our own lives, and we can only stand with them in a position of irreconcilable opposition.</p>
<p>So, if we go to war with Japan, can we be sure of victory?</p>
<p>From a historical point of view, the present is the era of the final backlash of the dying throes of capitalist imperialism. But no matter how it struggles, the result will inevitably tend to collapse, which is certain. On this point, we are confident in resisting Japan.</p>
<p>We see that Japan's current invasion of us has two purposes: first, to sell its surplus goods and shift internal contradictions outward.</p>
<p>But has Japan achieved this first purpose? We see that last year Japan's foreign trade decreased by 35% compared to the previous year. In principle, the devaluation of the Japanese yen last year should have increased its trade exports, but now it is trending downward, which shows that its desire to sell surplus goods is futile; looking at the current situation in Japanese society, ideology is still extremely left-leaning; order has not been seen to be at peace, which shows that his desire to shift internal contradictions outward is also a fantasy. Second, Japan wants to use Manchuria as a resource to be self-sufficient and resist the encroachment of surplus goods from international capitalist imperialism. However, the current economic panic is an overall global economic recession, and its fatal wound lies in the contradictions of capitalism itself, overproduction. Japan wants to use Manchurian resources alone to solve its difficulties under the entire world economic panic. Is this really possible? Moreover, after Japan seized Manchuria, it only increased its internal contradictions and economic chaos. Therefore, my conclusion is: first, if our country launches a full national revolution, it will definitely give a major shock to international capitalism, at least imperialism, and arouse the common struggle of oppressed nations around the world, otherwise, if we compromise with Japan, we will only sit and wait for death. Second, the launch of our country's entire national revolution is imminent. If we continue to delay, we will inevitably be divided up like melons and beans. (Recorded by Ye Wenxiong)</p>

<h3 id="e163">Cool Words <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>The northwest wind has disappeared for a long time, and the apricot blossom spring rain has also been sent away by the literati and elegant scholars. These days, the thermometer indicating the hot and cold weather has risen from over forty, over fifty, over sixty, to over seventy. Although the news of "heatstroke deaths of dock workers" and "rickshaw pullers suffering from heatstroke" has not yet been revealed in the newspapers, and the tongue in the dog's mouth has not yet been hung out, Dutch water has already been launched on the market, ice cream has been selling well, people who look at each other have opened their cheongsam jackets, and laborers have exposed their upper bodies. Everything is already showing that it is very hot.</p>
<p>In the cold weather, it is indeed effective in eliminating cold and relieving cold to persuade people to be "enthusiastic about ××" and "enthusiastic about ××," but when the weather is hot, it is a bit inappropriate to persuade people to be "enthusiastic about ××" and "enthusiastic about ××." So, "cool words" deserve to be lucky.</p>
<p>What is there to fear about national subjugation? The Jews have been without a country for more than a thousand years, and the Jews are so prominent. Didn't Poland also be subjugated? Look, isn't it very good now? As for India, even Shaw is advocating allowing it to be independent. The Koreans are even more amazing, making the Japanese busy and flustered with their revolution. We Chinese have lost the three northeastern provinces, plus Jehol. Old Zhang has a lot of capital and doesn't care. Even if the Japanese iron cavalry treads from Beiping and Tianjin to the Yellow River, crosses the Yangtze River, and goes straight to the Pearl River, and the whole of China is subjugated, will it really be "one Japanese person monitoring one Chinese person"? Even if China is subjugated, there will be no revolution, so it is certain that it will be subjugated, so there is no need to worry. There are many more slaves in the world, and it is not just us Chinese. Moreover, Japan will inevitably have a major earthquake sooner or later, Tokyo will sink to the bottom of the sea, and the people will all commit suicide. Even if it is not like this, the Northeast should be recovered by us by the end of this year. Taking a hundred steps back, if it is not recovered by the end of this year, Japan will inevitably have a revolution within ten years and automatically abandon the Northeast. In fact, these are all nonsense. How can China be subjugated? The Communists have exhausted their strength and will soon be united against foreign enemies and recover lost territory according to their consistent predetermined policy.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Legs <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Among the foods to eat, the taste of Jinhua ham is the best!</p>
<p>The grades of legs, in our human race, are white, rough, long and fat, and short and thin. Leg calves inserted in the field to work are the muddy legs of farmers, and long-distance runners are pairs of swift legs.</p>
<p>The beauty of the city and the beauty of the countryside are absolutely contradictory and absolutely different. Rural beauty values muddy legs, while urban beauty loves the snow-white skin of dancers and jade legs that are as smooth and tender as fat.</p>
<p>The radiant red light of the year is shrouded over the heads of lustful men. In this passionate atmosphere, the hearts of men can be tied down by dancers because they are completely seduced by those jade legs. Legs are indeed a mysterious fragment of the human body.</p>
<p>Now that the national crisis is imminent, legs are for people to use, not for people to play with, but the legs of the Chinese people are weak and unenergetic. Since encountering the famous short-legged Japanese people, who have been occupying our country's land step by step, our countrymen only know to leisurely and slowly retreat backward, but do not know to move forward! Those short-legged people have unceremoniously stepped into the three northeastern provinces, stepped into Jehol, and stepped inside the Great Wall. Although they still want to step forward and occupy more, can our countrymen allow him to move forward?</p>
<p>Today, if we want to reverse this declining trend and break this evil environment, indeed, we still need all our countrymen to muster up courage, slap their legs a few times, use our heat and blood to move forward, and fight those short-legged people to the death. I think, although the Japanese are barbaric, they will definitely not be able to withstand our saber cuts and hot blood spurts. The Japanese emperor will not have many fake legs to bestow on his soldiers, like he bestowed on Nomura.</p>
<p>The jade legs of women anesthetize human nature and exploit people's will. Compatriots, compatriots, the national crisis is urgent! You must wake up quickly!</p>
<h3 id="e165">Fasting <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>When I was young, I read textbooks and remembered the sentences "One day without food is hunger, three days without food is sickness, and seven days without food is death," but I don't know whether Bo Yi and Shu Qi on Shouyang Mountain suffered the exact, no more, no less, full seven days of famine.</p>
<p>Since that time, for two or three thousand years, until modern times, except for those who successfully fasted due to famine years, sieges, lawsuits, and other reasons, going from "hunger" to "sickness" and from "sickness" to "death," it seems that there has not been a third person to join besides Bo Yi and Shu Qi in history.</p>
<p>The Indian Father of the Nation, Mr. Gandhi, was once detained for revolution and fasted, but he endured more than six weeks of starvation. Although "hunger" and "sickness" were successfully completed step by step, he failed at the last moment, finally ending the fast and recovering his health.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, there was a Comrade Niu Lan who played the same trick, but from "hunger" to "sickness," he actually survived the deadline when he should have "died," and gave up his heroic act of fasting, resuming eating bread and drinking milk, and spending his specially preferential prison life.</p>
<p>It is really strange, how can Gandhi and Niu Lan "not die after seven days without food"? It is said that there are reasons for this. The first is because they usually drink goat's milk and cow's milk, which nourish them well, so they don't die, it's not that "their lives shouldn't end." The second is that they don't stop drinking water while fasting, which is also a clever trick. After all, the ancients were not as smart as modern people, and Bo Yi and Shu Qi didn't know this trick, so their "death" was a bit unjust.</p>
<p>Recently, the Indian Father of the Nation, Mr. Gan, has launched a major fast again. But according to the telegram, although he is still Gandhi, who usually drinks goat's milk, and although he still drinks water after fasting, "one day without food" has already made him feel that his stomach is empty, and "three days without food" has already made him so sick that he can hardly move. By the time this article is published, perhaps the "seven days without food" limit has already passed. But I don't know if it can be completed step by step and successfully.</p>
<p>People who have no food to eat desperately want to find food, while people who have status and food to eat insist on fasting. What is the reason? I really don't understand!</p>
<h3 id="e166">People Who Fly Over Walls <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>Chairman Han of Shandong, in order to "promote national martial arts," has specially sought talents who can "fly over walls, strike acupuncture points, and fence with swords," and has set up reward measures. This has aroused discussions among people in society. Some regard it as a joke, and some regard it as an incomprehensible superstition, like a child seeking immortality.</p>
<p>I remember when I was eight or nine years old, around the end of the Qing Guangxu period, my late father, Qiu Ping Gong, was assigned to Jiangsu as a Jinshi, listening to the drums of Wu Gate, and serving as the chief patrol officer of the North Road. He often captured bandits who could fly over walls. Those with great skills could not only fly lightly but also enter the water, hiding in the water for several hours, unharmed, and were nicknamed "Water Crows." These people possessed unique skills, rampaged through the provincial capital, committed numerous crimes, and because they were not easy to capture, the police officers hated them to the bone. At this time, Zhu the Blind (Zhu Zhuzha) served as the judicial commissioner and was very strict in dealing with bandits. Those who captured Water Crows were mostly given extreme punishments. It was really the most unfortunate era for "grassroots heroes."</p>
<p>One night, in the dead of night, a police officer, A, in the mansion was about to go to bed. Suddenly, he heard sounds like footsteps on the roof. He hurriedly called everyone up, and A first went to the drying platform to check. Although I was young, I was driven by curiosity and followed him up. Suddenly, I saw a person in black hiding in a corner, with a sharp blade inserted in his waist. The moonlight was slanted, and I could see him quite clearly. Just as A was about to step forward to arrest him, the person in black suddenly jumped over the river (we lived near the river) and hid on the roof of a shop across the street. Suddenly, there was a hubbub of voices, and everyone used bamboo poles to randomly poke into the air. The black-clothed thief suddenly jumped into the river again. Everyone searched the riverbank, but there were no ripples on the water and no trace of him. After a half-night of disturbance, it was fortunate that there were no losses. Everyone praised the wonder. You think he suddenly soars into the air like a bird, and suddenly enters the water like a swimming fish, like an amphibious animal. This ability of the Water Crow is really not small. Now, when I think about it, it seems like a dream.</p>
<p>These kinds of people who fly over walls are not absent at present. However, most of them have become thieves and have been obscured. Therefore, throughout history, the four words "flying over walls" have been the name for "roaming bandits." Now that Chairman Lu is in this time of national crisis, amidst the sounds of airplanes and cannons, he is actually at ease and wants to invite them out, treat them with the etiquette of distinguished guests. It is probably for "martial arts to save the country," or perhaps it is a method of "preserving national essence"!</p>

<p>Chapter Seven: A Few Words Sever Ties, Shut the Door and Weep Bitterly; One Shoulder Carries Duty, Wine is Shared in Discussion</p>
<p>Ji Zhi originally wanted to laugh, hoping to slip away under the cover of laughter. However, Mrs. Gan's face was devoid of any smile, so how could he make a joke? He had no choice but to take two steps back and sit down on the chair opposite her. Mrs. Gan exhaled smoke and smiled again. Then, pinching the cigarette between two fingers, she tapped the ash with her index finger, aiming for it to fall into the spittoon. She looked at Ji Zhi's face, as if she had a very important question to ask. Although Ji Zhi's mind was clouded with doubts, he naturally did not speak before his sister-in-law said anything. His sister-in-law's smile and look were truly embarrassing. Mrs. Gan said calmly, "Your brother told me that you are engaged to the old Miss Yang. Is that true?" Ji Zhi blushed and said, "That's not true." Mrs. Gan said seriously, "It's true. I'm not joking with you. If you think the old Miss Yang is good, you can get engaged to her. But…" she said, smiling. She held back the rest of her sentence after the word "but." Ji Zhi also said seriously, "It's really not true." Mrs. Gan said, "Don't blame your sister-in-law for scaring you with words. Actually, it's good that you're not engaged to her. Otherwise, your brother would lose his temper. It's not worth sacrificing your career for someone like that. With our family background and your qualifications, can't we find a good wife? Don't worry, within half a year, I'll find you someone as fresh as a flower. But there's one thing: you must break off all contact with the old Miss Yang." Ji Zhi looked at the ground, hesitant, and said in a low voice, "I don't have any contact with her in the first place." Mrs. Gan smiled and said, "You're lying to my face. Your brother saw you at the milk tea shop. You made an appointment with her to talk again in three years, why make such a long appointment?" Ji Zhi knew he couldn't deny it, blushed, and couldn't say a word. Mrs. Gan said, "Your brother came back yesterday, so angry that he couldn't even speak. I asked him many times before he explained. According to him, he wanted to issue an order to remove you from your position. I advised him, saying, 'We're brothers, why get angry? Just talk face to face.'" (74)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3 id="e168">Nine-Flavored Tea <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>The seats in the third-class tram are almost as comfortable and Westernized as those in Western-style houses. Everything in this carriage is Western-style: the separation of glass and window sashes, the decorative lines and patterns used, the neat, machine-made yellow steel fittings, and even the various advertisements posted are not found in the inland countryside. Moreover, there are constantly moving scenes and various characters outside, and colorful shop windows. A person who has just come from the inland feels a bit dizzy sitting inside, especially since it only costs seven or five copper coins!</p>
<p>Recently, I've noticed that many of the characters used in the Shanghai newspaper articles are different from the original ones. Although the sounds are similar (actually not the same sound, only similar) and the meanings are also similar, there are significant differences from the original meanings. For example, "slightly" is sometimes written as "slightly," "advantages and disadvantages" as "fierce," "smart" as "clever," and "street gossip" as "street language," and so on. I don't know if the writers are deliberately changing them to show novelty, or if they can't remember the original characters for a moment and are temporarily writing out similar sounds with meanings that can be understood.</p>
<p>Dreams seem to be more extreme than reality. If it is a rational dream, even a very ordinary thing can feel very serious in the dream. If it is an emotional dream, it is mostly related to sadness. Even a very slight touch can make you greatly sad, even making you cry so hard that you can't breathe. Although you don't find many tears flowing when you wake up, you are already extremely grief-stricken in the dream. (Later, I discovered that when I have such dreams, nine times out of ten it's because my mouth and nose are covered by the quilt, suffocating my breath, hence the dream.) As for encountering bandits and ferocious beasts, being persecuted, and even being killed, I have experienced them all in dreams, and more than once.</p>
<p>If there were no young people for ten years, and everyone was either young children or adults above a certain age, I wonder what the state of romance would become.</p>
<p>As long as you are willing to shout until your voice is hoarse, there will definitely be the first person to applaud, and then everyone else will follow.</p>
<p>In the books that I love to read, I like them to have some advertisements for other books. These advertisements are not annoying, as long as the books they introduce have equal value and similar nature to the book I am currently enjoying, but don't post irrelevant advertisements.</p>
<p>Excessive desires are like a bright moon hanging in space. Although it cannot be said that the moon is a place that humans cannot reach, if someone could reach it, it would be an extraordinary event.</p>
<p>The Peking Opera theater symbolizes the entire Chinese society. Peking Opera is the crystallization of Chinese drama, and the state of the Peking Opera theater is the crystallization of Chinese society. As long as the situation in the Peking Opera theater improves a little, China will probably not be invaded by others.</p>
<p>It's a pity that the washed-up leading actor is now only playing an unimportant role in the front row.</p>
<p>Running errands is really boring.</p>
<p>Even if there are no exciting dramas, several plays still have to be staged at the beginning, because the old officials in the troupe need to eat, and the other unimportant roles and even the extras need to eat as well.</p>
<p>Mutual love is like colored flowers, plants, and bird feathers, with rich reds and lush greens, naturally pleasing to people. Unrequited love is like light ink landscape paintings, although simple and unadorned, their quality can sometimes be higher than that of colored paintings.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful and short-lived love is like a short story; momentary events that seem like love but are not are like a piece of miscellaneous thoughts, each with its own intriguing aspects.</p>
<p>Age will cancel your happiness.</p>
<p>Because I am over thirty years old, talking about love feels a bit embarrassing.</p>
<p>Some people say that married people are not worthy of talking about love, and people with children should not talk about love even more. Others say that marriage and love are not the same thing, and children have nothing to do with love.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Education Funding in Concessions <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Lin Kanghou, the Chinese member of the Public Concession’s Works Department, at the Banking Association, inquiring about matters such as the Works Department’s requests for subsidies for educational expenses for schools established by Chinese people within the concession. According to the discussion, the Works Department allocates more than 150,000 taels annually to subsidize educational expenses within the concession, and there is currently no possibility of increasing this amount. Chinese schools within the concession can receive a strong 50% of this subsidy. Schools established by Chinese people within the concession that wish to request subsidies must have their applications transferred through the Municipal Bureau of Education. However, the Works Department has specific regulations regarding the issuance of subsidies to these schools, limiting them to matters such as adding new school buildings to meet school hygiene requirements. Requests that have not been approved recently are due to non-compliance with the aforementioned regulations. Rumors that the Works Department will increase this subsidy are not true.</p>

<p>▲Holds the National Record for 3000 Meters</p>
<p>▲Once Produced Two East China Records</p>
<p>▲Previous Scores All Surpassed Those of Universities</p>
<p>▲Still Two Records Better Than Jiangnan University's</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Secondary School Sports Federation has held three track and field competitions. In terms of history, the period is very short. In terms of results, it is quite impressive. In the past, every time there was a middle school competition, its records were not only the best among the middle schools at the time, but also far surpassed the results of university sports. The facts are all there and can be verified. Anyone who knows a little about the sports situation in Shanghai can say this. Among them, the results of the second sports meeting in the 18th year of the Republic of China were the best. Among the 17 track and field events, 11 broke the records of the first meeting. Chen Xingpei's 3000 meters still holds the national record. Others, such as Wang Jihuai's triple jump and Chen Xingpei's 1500 meters, were also the highest records in East China at the time. Among these 11 new records, eight of the scores were not reached in the university sports and Shanghai open sports meeting of that year. The excellence of the scores was the best at the time. To this day, the scores of 200 meters and 1500 meters are higher than the highest records of universities. The scores of 400 meters, triple jump, javelin, and other three items are still better than the scores of this year's Jiangnan University Sports Meeting. All of these are the most glorious achievements of Shanghai middle school athletes in the history of sports, and are worthy of commemoration and admiration, and also worthy of being praised in front of the public. Looking back on the past and present, athletes from all schools should work harder to promote the glory of the association in the past. There are high expectations for today's meeting.

<h3 id="e191">A Brief History of the Secondary School Sports Federation <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The association was established in the winter of the 16th year of the Republic of China. Counting the days, it has been six years since then. It aims to promote the development of sports and the cultivation of spirit in Shanghai's secondary schools. In the midst of connecting feelings, it cultivates the noble demeanor of athletes. Over the years, it has held various sports competitions, which have continued to this day. Initially, there were 12 basic member schools. Later, Lida Academy, Chengzhong Middle School, and Zhonghua Vocational Changshi Middle School withdrew one after another for various reasons, leaving eight schools. Later, Hujiang High School Affiliated to Nanyang Business College joined as new members, and finally Daxia High School Affiliated also joined, making a total of 11 member schools. Looking back at that time, the association was established after the Jiangnan University Sports Association in the large city of Shanghai. All the rules and regulations were based on the assistance of sports pioneers and the generous support of the authorities of various schools. The concerted efforts and mutual assistance of the members, with one heart and one mind, are the common creed that the association has adhered to over the years. On the occasion of the opening of the fourth track and field meeting, I would like to inform all sectors of society of what I know, and hope that people from all walks of life, sports pioneers, and the authorities of various schools will uphold their original intentions and encourage the younger generation, so that this fledgling infant can be nurtured into a child and grow day by day. It would be fortunate. (Lu Xiangqian)</p>
<p>Inter-Departmental Football Match Between Newspapers Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e192">Shishi Wins Over Minbao <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲Result: Four to Two</p>
<p>丨Morning Post vs. Times Post Match Suspended Due to Rain丨</p>
<p>Shanghai's inter-departmental football match between newspapers, a pioneering event in China's journalism world, held its third and fourth matches yesterday afternoon at the Shanghai Municipal First Public Sports Field. At 4:00 PM, it was the Morning Post against the Times Post, and at 5:00 PM, it was the Shishi News against the Minbao. Details are listed below to record the grand occasion:</p>
<h3 id="e193">Morning Post vs. Times Post Match Suspended Due to Rain <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>As the clock struck four, thunder and rain began. The football field was already wet. The warriors from the Morning Post and the Times Post gathered inside the camp, rubbing their fists and preparing to fight. Yao Sufeng was in a bad mood and shouted "Let's compete!" The crowd responded. Therefore, captains Qu Yue and Jiang Zongdao decided to declare war and led their teams onto the field. Referee Zhang Longhai blew the whistle, and the scribes who usually bury their heads in writing suddenly showed the power of killing enemies on horseback. However, the weather was not good, with dark clouds gathering and heavy rain pouring down. The referee blew the whistle to retreat. After ten minutes, the clouds dispersed and the rain stopped, and the warriors returned to the field. But then a downpour fell again, so both sides agreed to temporarily suspend the war and decide the winner at 4:00 PM on the 26th.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Shishi Wins Over Minbao Four to Two <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Showers continued until 5:30 PM. The warriors from Shishi News and Minbao were eager to try. Jiang Xiangqing first took off his shoes to demonstrate, and the others did not want to be left behind, so they changed clothes, took off their shoes, and rushed onto the field, their courage reaching the sky.</p>
<p>▲Muddy Figures　When Zhang Longhai gave the serious order to attack, Shishi News took the offensive first. Right wing Nie Shiqi got the ball and passed it to the center. The barefoot immortal Jiang Xiangqing shot but missed. Enraged, he fought bravely. The water and mud were slippery, making it difficult to keep his feet. He chased after the ball, clearly distinguishing himself. Afterwards, there was a continuous sound of slapping and falling on both sides. It is unknown how many people temporarily dressed up as muddy figures. Those who were careful to avoid falling were quite amusing to watch as they walked gracefully.</p>
<p>▲Wu Dong Saves the Day　After ten minutes of fighting, Shishi News gained a free kick opportunity in the chaos, about fifteen yards from the enemy's goal. Jiang Xiangqing kicked it barefoot, hitting it squarely. Minbao goalkeeper Wu Dong caught it and threw it out, overcoming the difficulty.</p>
<p>▲Shishi Wins Again　But in a blink of an eye, Shishi's iron cavalry rushed through two lines of defense. Right wing Nie Shiqi dribbled the ball to the center. Jiang Xiangqing got the ball, stood firm, aimed, and shot. The ball went into the net, opening the scoring. After restarting, before the formation was stable, Shishi's advance troops arrived in Minbao's territory again, and Nie Shiqi kicked in another goal.</p>
<p>▲Minbao's Misfortune　After several scrambles, Minbao made some progress and was about to launch a direct attack when they were penalized for a handball, about twenty-five yards from the goal. Jiang Xiangqing volunteered again, kicking the ball hard. Wu Dong calmly saved the day a second time. However, one wave had not subsided before another rose. Shishi's three armies surged forward, and Jiang Xiangqing took advantage of the opportunity to shoot from an oblique angle. Wu Dong moved to meet it, slipped, and fell to the ground, losing another goal, which was truly unfortunate. This was the situation in the first half.</p>
<p>▲Goalkeeper Slips　In the second half, the formations of both sides changed slightly. On the Shishi side, Jiang Xiangqing retreated to be the goalkeeper, and Xia Kaiming went to the front line to attack. On the Minbao side, Wu Dong also moved to the left wing to lead the front line, turning defense into offense, full of ambition. No sooner said than done, the muddy ball flew up and went straight to the Shishi News's net. Jiang Xiangqing caught it and was about to shoot when the enemy cavalry arrived, skillfully dodging around and losing his balance, falling backwards into the net, losing a goal.</p>
<p>▲Old Immortal Saves the Day　After restarting, Shishi's advance troops took the opportunity to attack again, and Gong Zhongxian from the left wing got a ball. But the Minbao team was determined not to give up, trapping Jiang Xiangqing in a situation where he was surrounded on all sides. Fortunately, the old immortal Pan Gongbi arrived alone on horseback and cleared the ball with one kick.</p>
<p>▲Last Touch of Glory　However, the Minbao team's attack became more urgent from then on. After several twists and turns, Zhang Zhen from the right wing finally scored a goal, creating a score of two to four. Although Minbao lost, its strength should not be ignored.</p>

<p>— Recorded by Lu Bingqian</p>
<p>(I) England and France. There have not been many changes in British education after the war. Originally, the British national character valued freedom and disliked restrictions. We only need to look at the fact that their laws are unwritten, and even their constitution is so, but the British can consciously abide by them, believing that abiding by the law is not for the sake of the law, but a duty that should be fulfilled. Moreover, the British like to stick to the old ways. For anything, even if they know it is bad, they would rather let it develop gradually than use drastic reforms. Therefore, new ideas are not accepted in England. This situation is different from that of the United States. British education has no system. Their Ministry of Education is run by private individuals, and everyone does things according to their own will, without government intervention, resulting in uneven quality. However, after the war, they were able to recognize their mistakes and adopted two methods to remedy this problem. First, they implemented a unified examination system to check the academic achievements of various schools. A group of schools, in order to maintain their position and reputation in society, participated in the unified examination, so they could be brought into line imperceptibly. Second, they stipulated a subsidy system. Many schools with insufficient resources could enjoy subsidies. To enjoy subsidies, they must first comply with the conditions promulgated by the government, so the schools could be brought together imperceptibly. This compromise and reconciliation method is very suitable for the British national character. As for major reforms, they did exist at the beginning of the European War, with people drafting education reform plans, wanting to thoroughly transform the schools. This kind of major reform was originally not very suitable for the British national character, but later, when the war had just ended and everyone was mentally exhausted, even though everyone knew it was unsuitable, they were powerless to object. Therefore, it was passed in Parliament. However, in the end, only two or three tenths of it was implemented. The reason for this was, of course, economic difficulties, but also because of their inherent nature, they were determined not to use revolutionary means to reform the system and methods of education. Seeing this point, the Ministry of Education organized many committees in 1926, such as those for primary schools, secondary schools, and universities, to gradually promote based on national character. Therefore, there have not been many changes in British education after the war. France is also similar. French education is systematic and is all regulated by the government. Even the specific pages to be taught in a certain lesson at a certain time are all regulated. After the war, there were slight changes, and the facilities of the schools could be used for free activities, but there were very few opportunities. France was the earliest to have a revolution, but the concept of class is very deep. The admission of the upper class and the lower class is different. The upper class can enter preparatory schools, from middle school to university. The lower class can only enter ordinary schools and have no opportunity to enter middle school or university. Therefore, their school system can be called a dual-track system. After the war, a group of influential people advocated reform and unification, determined only by each person's ability.</p>
<p>(II) Emerging Countries. They have no education system at all. After the establishment of the country, they strive to create a new system, but due to insufficient financial resources, they can only try economic methods. The plan they have set is based on the distribution of the local population. First, they investigate which place has the densest population and which place has the sparsest population. What is the distribution of the population in villages and cities? How far is the distance between villages and cities? Then they compile statistics to decide which places should establish schools. All school-age children within ten kilometers (approximately ten li) of all schools can enter nearby schools. In this way, the schools will not be duplicated, nor will there be a lack. The same is true for primary schools and secondary schools. This plan is really an economic method, but it can also achieve great results.</p>
<p>(III) Germany and Austria. They used to be autocratic countries. The educational goal was not for individuals, but for the imperial system. After the war, the political direction changed, and new education also rose. Therefore, new education laws are easily seen in Germany and Austria, especially in Germany, where many new schools have been established. When we talk about education, it seems that the United States is indispensable, but in reality, the educational methods and achievements of Germany and Austria are very admirable and can be emulated.</p>
<p>(IV) Russia and Italy. They regard education as a political tool, so the changes are also very large.</p>
<p>III. European Education Trends. Summarizing the recent trends in education in various European countries, (I) before the war, education in various countries had no major goals. After the war, various countries saw national decline and improper education, so they decided on education policies and then acted according to the policies. The content of the policies, simply speaking, is to make education available to all, so that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy education. In the past, educational rights in France were very unequal, and some people were often restricted. Their abilities were worthy of being enjoyed, but they were not allowed by law. Now, the so-called dual-track system and multi-track system have all been broken, and they are exploring new paths there. (II) Emphasizing National Defense. European countries implement education and extremely emphasize national defense education. Their teaching materials and teaching methods are all like this. For example, the glorious history of the country, etc., are all considered good materials, so that all children can understand them in their hearts. Especially for emerging countries, with an unstable foundation, it is necessary to make children have patriotic thoughts and concepts, so attention must be paid to education. (III) Production-oriented, that is, vocational. They do not advocate cultivating a group of unemployed idlers. They want to enable everyone to have considerable vocational skills after receiving education. Moreover, education should not be limited to schools. Schools can only represent a small part of education and cannot represent the entirety of education. Education outside of schools has the same value. The so-called social education is strongly advocated by them because it can equally enlighten the public, especially in Russia. In educational administration, it does not take schools as units, but divides educational undertakings into social education, vocational education, political education, etc. Political education does not necessarily run primary schools or secondary schools or universities. This method is very worthy of our attention. China takes schools too seriously, thinking that running schools is all that is needed to run education. This is wrong. (IV) Regarding the life of teachers, all countries are very miserable. Like the teachers in Poland and England, the work is very heavy. In the past, they taught 22 lessons per week, but now they have to teach 30 lessons, and some even have their salaries reduced, so their lives are very poor. Moreover, like the school buildings in our country and Poland, they are also very simple, but their spirit is very good.</p>

<p>— Gan</p>
<p>China now has two kinds of bombing, one is bombing in, and the other is bombing in. An example of bombing in is: "Except for the planes bombing the bandit areas, there were no battles during the day. Teams three and four flew from the 7th morning to Shen (Shanghai), taking turns in teams to fly west of Yihuang and south of Chongren, dropping two to three hundred 120-pound bombs. All the places where the bandits could use as cover were bombed and destroyed almost completely, so that the bandits had no place to rest..." (Shenbao Nanchang Special Dispatch, May 10)</p>
<p>An example of bombing in is: "At six o'clock this morning, enemy planes bombed Jixian County, killing more than ten civilians. In addition, Miyun County was bombed four times by the enemy, with two planes each time, dropping over a hundred bombs. The damage is being investigated..." (Datong Evening News Beijing Dispatch on the same day)</p>
<p>Born out of this "movement" are the Shanghai elementary school students buying airplanes and the Beijing elementary school students digging caves.</p>
<p>This is also a good article on the topics of "No internal pacification, no external resistance" or "Internal pacification is more urgent than external resistance."</p>
<p>People living in the concessions are blessed. But if you close your eyes and think about it more broadly, you will feel that the inside is the government soldiers in the sky, and the "Communist bandits" and the "banditized" people are on the ground; the outside is the enemy army in the sky, and the non-"banditized" people are on the ground. "The damage is being investigated," while in the peaceful area, a pagoda is being built. When Shakyamuni was born, he pointed one finger to the sky and one finger to the ground, saying: "Above and below the heavens, I alone am honored!" This is what it means.</p>
<p>But if you close your eyes and think about it for a longer time, you will encounter a difficult question. If the bombing in is slow and the bombing in is fast, what will happen when the two kinds of planes meet? Will they stop the "internal pacification" and turn around to "fight head-on," or will they still only take care of bombing in, letting the other follow along bombing in, one in front and one behind, bombing the "bandit areas" together, waiting until they are cleared, and then "resist" them out? ...</p>
<p>But this is just a joke. In fact, it will never come to this point. Even if it comes to this point, there is nothing difficult to solve: recuperating abroad, worshiping Buddha in famous mountains, and that's the end of it.</p>

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>He eagerly awaited tomorrow, tomorrow would bring him a different destiny. He watched his body, worn down by the time in prison, but he knew his heart was not broken.</p>
<p>There were so many injustices in the world; just because a friend he lived with had committed a crime, he was implicated and thrown into prison as well. He only knew this friend after they started living together, and he still didn't fully understand what crime the man had committed. Being arrested together wasn't really surprising; they lived in the same house and were about the same age, so it was easy to become a suspect. Once in prison, two lawyers defended his friend, but they shifted many of the pieces of evidence and facts onto him. Although he denied it and defended himself, it was useless. He didn't have money to hire a lawyer, and his parents back in his hometown didn't have the money to hire a lawyer for him either. Thus, he was convicted; but he didn't know what happened to the one who actually committed the crime. From that moment on, he suspected something behind the law, what the law was built upon.</p>
<p>He finally left the prison, where he had lived for three years, amidst the farewell glances of his companions. As soon as he stepped outside, the first thing he felt was the bright sunlight and fresh air; however, this light and freshness soon faded away, gradually dimming.</p>
<p>The streets were much busier than before. New buildings, resplendent, tall, the things in the display windows were truly dazzling. Women's dresses were long enough to cover their heels, and some were higher on the left and lower on the right, as if the tailor had cut them wrong, dragging along in varying lengths.</p>
<p>He forgot his hair, which had grown more than three inches long, forgot the dirty and wrinkled jacket he was wearing, only felt the emptiness in his stomach, and the emptiness in his heart. The world before him was too far removed from him.</p>
<p>He didn't know where the strength came from, but as he thought, his spirits perked up; the new horrors were like a whip lashing at his heart.</p>
<p>He walked on, oblivious to everything, because he had too many things to fear in his heart. In front of a large store, he saw a familiar face, and that person also looked at him. It was truly coincidental. Upon closer inspection, the familiar face was the friend he had lived with, the friend who had caused him to spend three years in prison. But his appearance was much more prosperous than before.</p>
<p>"Shafei, I didn't expect to see you today," the man said awkwardly first.</p>
<p>"Today marks three years, you haven't forgotten, have you?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, I'm sorry for what happened to you..."</p>
<p>"What exactly were you doing back then that got the authorities to arrest you and make me serve three years in prison for you?"</p>
<p>The friend replied embarrassedly, "At that time, I had many friends who organized an association to oppose the authorities. I participated in this while studying. Somehow, the matter was leaked, and you and I were arrested together that day, along with many others who were arrested. My family has wealthy uncles who hold official positions. I usually argued with my family because I opposed my own family. After that incident was exposed, my family used various methods to save me. With money and an uncle who was an official, things became easy to handle. At the time, I was very opposed, but the lawyer spoke for me, saying that I had a mental illness and wasn't allowed to speak..."</p>
<p>"So what are you doing now?..."</p>
<p>"Now, after being released by the court, I returned to the university where I was studying, graduated from the law department, and now I work in the Ministry of Justice..."</p>
<p>It turned out that the friend who had caused him to spend three years in prison had long been an official in the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>Did he hate him? No. It wasn't entirely his fault.</p>
<p>However, when this friend, with a hint of apology, invited him to his home, he didn't say anything, only cast a contemptuous glance at him, and turned away.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Funeral <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>A child, just over a month old, fell ill with pneumonia and was staying in the hospital. Judging from the situation that night, his journey seemed to be coming to an end; when I saw it, I thought that this might be the last glance, and told the people in the hospital: if anything happens, please call me. After saying that, I trudged home with a sorrowful gait.</p>
<p>The next morning, the phone rang, saying that the child had passed away from the pneumonia.</p>
<p>I packed a set of clothes that had been made but not yet worn, and emptied a suitcase, and brought it to the hospital. The child's body was still slightly warm, and his complexion had not changed much; I changed him into the clothes and placed him in the suitcase. I then took him to the burial site that had been pre-arranged.</p>
<p>When the car arrived at Wusong Town, I thought I had reached the seaside, so I got out of the car indifferently. After getting out of the car, I realized that there was still some distance to the seaside. Afraid that the rickshaw would be too bumpy, I carried the suitcase silently and walked slowly, from the bustling town to the stone embankment where there was hardly any trace of people.</p>
<p>The weather that day was no less dim than my mood, and there was also some wind, so the sound of the waves on the stone embankment accompanied me. When I reached the middle of the embankment, the wind seemed especially strong, and the waves were especially heavy. I thought the tide was coming in. The tide might flood this embankment, I thought again. I looked ahead, and then looked back. I didn't know how fast the tide would come in. The tide was indeed coming, and it was getting faster and faster. Could I still go forward? I hesitated in my heart, but my feet kept moving. So I looked back again, and saw that the distance between the shore and me was longer than the distance between me and the lighthouse. But it seemed to take some time to get to the lighthouse. Go back? I didn't want to. I looked at the suitcase. Although my heart was not as turbulent as the waves, it could be said that it was still very calm, and my pace was still moving at the original rate. I thought that this funeral might turn into a burial with the dead, but I didn't believe that such a thing would happen. I saw a boat parked not far away. This was the last time I was doing my best for him. I wanted to go forward, looking at the lighthouse.</p>
<p>Finally, I reached the end of the stone embankment. I opened the suitcase and threw him into the sea. I stared at him, undulating with the waves. As if knowing my thoughts, he kept rolling outward, never lingering, getting smaller and smaller, and finally, so small that it was beyond my sight. So my heart seemed to loosen, thinking that he had escaped this earthly world, had escaped my heart.</p>
<p>This is how I sent off the child's funeral, the child that had worried me for more than a month.</p>

<p>— Yu Zhan</p>
<p>(Twenty-nine) National Martial Arts and Foreign Insults</p>
<p>Mr. Zhigang saw my article "National Martial Arts and Foreign Insults" and showed me a passage from the "Lin Ju Man Lu" (Random Records from a Cottage) by Wu Yuanhua of the Ming Dynasty, which he had recorded in his manual. Only then did I learn that using national martial arts to resist Japan had existed since the Ming Dynasty. Moreover, that person was the Provincial Governor of Shandong, which is equivalent to the position of the current Shandong Chairman. One ancient and one modern, echoing each other from afar, is absolutely interesting and must be recorded. "Lin Ju Man Lu" says: "Song Gong of Tongjiang had eloquence and a great love for numerology. When he was Provincial Governor of Shandong, Japanese pirates invaded Korea, and alarm bells rang everywhere. Gong ordered the prefectures of Dengzhou and Laizhou to collect tens of thousands of chicken eggs each. When asked what they were for, he said, 'The Japanese come by boat, and I will throw chicken eggs at them. The boat will be slippery, and they won't be able to stand, and we will capture them all.' Those near and far all laughed, but only Lanxi admired him, promoted him to Junior Sima, and appointed him as the General Superintendent of military affairs to conquer the Japanese. Earlier, there was a Taoist named Zhang Junjiu who possessed minor magic tricks. Gong invited him to be a guest in his tent. Once he arrived in Liaodong, he demanded two hundred tables from the people, stacked several feet high. Junjiu let down his hair, held a sword, stood on the table, and shouted to the crowd, 'In three days, there will be a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers to help me destroy the Japanese.' The next night, he secretly went to a brothel to stay and fought with a military officer, injured his eye, and fled. Gong was greatly disappointed and falsely said, 'I have even more magical arts, and I will make the Japanese chieftains tie themselves up and surrender to me.' Alas! Even if the imperial court lacks talent, why should it appoint a verbose and strange person to be in charge of one side, desecrate the prestige of China, and invite the contempt of the barbarians?" In the past few days, Shandong Province is holding a national martial arts examination, having already recruited extraordinary talents who can fly over eaves and walk on walls and use acupressure. They should also obtain knights who can swallow knives, spit fire, and fly swords. It is hoped that in the future, when resisting Japan, they will quickly achieve skin-deep results. These wandering knights of the martial arts world should be declared to the national history and biographies, and novelists will no longer have to make empty lies! Wouldn't that be great?</p>

<p>— Jules Kenaru, translation adapted by Lin Quzuo</p>
<p>The Blind Man (continued)</p>
<p>But Lépiek's wife was using a clever trick. She brushed against the blind man, she bumped him with her elbow, she stepped on his foot, she made him retreat, forcing him to sit between the cupboard and the wardrobe, in the unheated area. The blind man was disoriented, groping, making gestures, his fingers clinging like animals. He was making a commotion in the dark. The ice in his veins had congealed again, and now he was freezing to death.</p>
<p>The blind man finished his story in a voice that sounded like he was about to cry.</p>
<p>"Yes, my good friends, it's over, no eyes, nothing, just pitch black."</p>
<p>He accidentally knocked over his cane. This was exactly what Lépiek's wife was waiting for. She hurriedly ran over, picked up the cane, and returned it to the blind man, but she didn't actually return it to him.</p>
<p>He thought he had received it, but he hadn't.</p>
<p>She was deceiving him so cleverly, and then she made him change his seat. She gave him his clogs and led him towards the door.</p>
<p>Then she gently pinched him, just to vent her anger; she pushed him out the door, pushed him under the snowy, gloomy sky, pushed him into the howling wind.</p>
<p>Before closing the door, Lépiek's wife shouted desperately at the blind man, as if dealing with a deaf person:</p>
<p>"Goodbye; don't lose the money; if the weather is good and you are still alive, see you next Sunday. Really! You're right, old man Dixier, we'll never know whether we'll die or live tomorrow. Everyone has their troubles, and God treats everyone the same!"</p>
<p>New Year's Day</p>
<p>It was snowing. In order to make New Year's Day a New Year's Day, it should of course snow.</p>
<p>Lépiek's wife had thoughtfully bolted the courtyard gate the night before. Early in the morning, many naughty children ran over and shook the bolt. Everyone crowded outside the gate. At first they were polite, but then they got angry and kicked it with their clogs. Finally, they were too lazy to wait any longer and retreated, but they still turned back to look at Lépiek's wife, who was hiding there peeking at them through the window. The sound of their footsteps disappeared in the snow.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers jumped out of bed and ran to the sink in the garden to wash his face. But there was no soap. The sink was already frozen. He had to break the ice. This early exercise made him feel hot all over, which was really more beneficial than a stove. But he only wet his face a little and didn't wash it clean, so others often thought he was dirty. Even if he immersed his face in the water to wash it, he would only remove the most obvious dirt.</p>
<p>He briskly and freshly participated in the New Year's greetings. He stood behind his older brother Felix, and Felix stood behind his older sister Elestine. The three children walked into the kitchen together. Lépiek and Lépiek's wife were already waiting there, both looking like nothing was amiss.</p>
<p>Sister Elestine embraced and kissed them and said:</p>
<p>"Good morning, Dad. Good morning, Mom. I wish you a happy New Year, good health, and ascent to heaven in the future."</p>
<p>Older brother Felix said the same, speaking fluently and extremely quickly, and also embraced and kissed them.</p>
<p>But Red Carrot Whiskers was different. He took out a letter from his hat. The tightly sealed envelope was written with: "Presented to my parents." The envelope did not have a place name written on it. In the corner of the envelope was a magnificent bird with splendid feathers, in the act of flapping its wings and flying.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers handed the letter to Lépiek's wife, and she opened the letter. The stationery was decorated with several blooming flowers, and a circle of lace was sewn around the stationery. When Red Carrot Whiskers wrote, he often dropped the pen into the eyelets of the lace, and even ruined the words near the lace.</p>
<p>Lépiek: What about me, don't I get anything!</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers: This is for both of you; Mom will pass it on to you.</p>
<p>Lépiek: In this way, you favor your mother. Well, search your body and see if that new six-sou coin is in your pocket! (To be continued)</p>

<p>Since the gold market fell back the day before yesterday, yesterday morning, foreign telegrams reported that the British and American silver markets continued to rise. Exchange rates rose and fell. Although the five-month forward silver market rose slightly by five hao, it then fell slightly by five hao to two and a half li, so it seemed that it should be slightly better. However, the raw market opened at seventy-four yuan and five jiao, slightly lower than before, really because stocks rose by more than one yuan. It was reported that the representatives of the United States, Mexico, and Canada held a meeting to discuss silver issues, and have agreed to curb and reduce the silver content of coins, use silver as auxiliary coins to restore the inherent purity of silver coins, and use silver as reserves by various central banks.

<h3 id="e210">Securities: Delivery Approaching, Bond Market Short Squeeze <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced a sudden short squeeze in public bonds. Shorts began to panic. The US President issued a telegram ensuring world peace, and Huang Fu arrived in Tianjin, further solidifying the atmosphere of peace. Market sentiment was exceptionally strong. However, given the magnitude of these events, they are not to be taken lightly. The short squeeze is due to the approaching delivery date, creating a bullish trend with signs of prosperity. At the opening yesterday morning, only Reorganization bonds No. 21 and No. 43 were sold slightly, dropping a fraction of a cent and a half. Starting with forward-dated Reorganization bonds, buying pressure was strong, gradually pushing prices higher. Subsequently, various bonds saw even more significant gains, some rising by as much as sixty cents. In the second session, short sellers were increasingly covering their positions. Apart from forward-dated Consolidated Tax bonds which fell slightly by a cent, the rest continued to rise by thirty to fifty cents, indicating a clear short squeeze. In the afternoon session, there was back and forth trading between bulls and bears. Bonds rose by thirty to fifty cents and fell by twenty to thirty cents. When the forward-dated Salt Tax bond was auctioned, number 32 experienced a surge in selling, and the market price dropped from high to low, only ending up five cents higher. This caused a sudden change in the situation. At the close, the market was uncertain. Initially, various bonds rose or fell only twenty to thirty cents. However, when Salt Tax was auctioned, number 46 suddenly experienced a large sell-off, causing a dramatic shift in trend. The market price plummeted by one dollar and twenty cents, and forward-dated bonds also fell by ninety cents. This was also a result of prices being too high, attracting large-scale selling. As a result, only Salt Tax fell by twenty to thirty cents, while the rest continued to rise from twelve cents to one dollar. The total trading volume amounted to 17,244,200 yuan, of which 19,200 yuan was in spot contracts, and futures contracts for Consolidated Salt Tax, Troop Reduction, 1920 Customs, and 2020 Customs accounted for 7,525,000 yuan, 2,490,000 yuan, 2,465,000 yuan, and 3,615,000 yuan respectively, while the rest ranged from tens of thousands to two hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e211">New York Stock Market Unanimously Strengthens <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from New Feng Foreign Firm, on Wednesday (the 17th), New York stocks, bonds, and commodities all strengthened unanimously. German Chancellor Hitler's speech was generally considered favorable. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph announced that dividends would remain unchanged, and the stock once reached a new high of $112.875. Furthermore, according to a report from the Steel Age Magazine, the steel industry's operating rate increased to 35% this week, the highest peak since June 23, 1931. This is due to orders from various sectors, with significant expansion in the tinplate and agricultural implement industries. However, in the current situation, if demand from the railway and construction sectors continues to be low, the steel industry may find it difficult to make further progress. The total trading volume for the day was 4,790,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>30 Industrial Stocks　82.64　Up 1.35</p>

<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, with a very sharp trend. Market sentiment was chaotic and varied. Most people were bullish, because raw cotton prices were rising, increasing factory costs. At the same time, actual demand from southern ports remained healthy, resulting in more new positions being taken. In the afternoon, profit-taking by bulls led to a decline.</p>

<p>At the opening of the man-labelled goods market this morning, market sentiment was mediocre. In the second and third sessions, the Kwangtung firms massively covered their short positions, and the buying surge was intense. Prices for various months rose by one dollar and eight, nine cents to two dollars and four, five, six cents. In the afternoon, scattered long positions were closed out, and prices for various months fell by one dollar and seven cents to two dollars and three cents.

<p>The cotton market continued to rise sharply, with a stronger trend than the yarn market. This was due to the low inventory in Shanghai. While imported cotton was stable, it was still difficult to calculate when it would arrive in Shanghai, leading to a bullish sentiment. Many new long positions were taken, and even though large firms were selling, it was difficult to suppress the price increase.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Cheng Label market this morning, the market was relatively stable due to the flat and sluggish imported cotton market. In the second and third sessions, prices followed the yarn market's surge, reaching a high of 47.1 yuan. Prices for various months rose by five, six, seven cents. In the afternoon, the market was slightly calmer, falling five cents to one cent. The total trading volume for the day was 144,800 dan.

In the Egyptian cotton market, spot prices fell by 6 points. In the Bombay cotton market, prices fell due to selling by speculators and Japanese traders.

<p>The early silkworms in the four rural districts have already entered the "grand sleep" with lush leaves. The next batch are also waking up from their "grand sleep," and the late batch are also feeding on leaves during their third instar. This year, the weather is sunny and warm, and many silkworm farmers are raising foreign breeds, with supervisors assisting them. The silkworm eggs are developing well, and the leaf production is high, with leaf prices also low. However, in recent days, thunderstorms have repeatedly occurred, with strong winds, rain, and hail, causing the early silkworms in the Yaojiaqiao area to undergo changes, with diarrhea and delayed sleep. The late silkworms' sleep is also uneven. Supervisors are rushing to rescue them, isolating the diseased silkworms. In another week, the early silkworms will show new promise.</p>

<p>The improved breeds raised in the Gao Si and Sanbao areas of Linping are not few. Supervisors are guiding the rearing with new methods, and the silkworm eggs are developing smoothly. The early batch has entered the "grand sleep," the next batch is also feeding on lush leaves during their third instar, and the late batch is also feeding on enough leaves during their second instar. In recent days, thunderstorms have been hot and humid, causing the early silkworms to eat leaves sluggishly and delay their sleep. Supervisors are currently trying to take care of them, and the losses are still small. However, the remaining local breeds in the four rural districts are now producing lush leaves, but silkworm farmers are not careful in feeding the leaves, and the silkworms are eating rainwater-soaked leaves, occasionally showing symptoms such as yellow diarrhea and black vomiting. Farmers and silkworm farmers alike are worried. Less than 50% of the silkworm houses in the four rural districts have been rented out.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firm silk market, French firms continued to actively cover their short positions in Sichuan raw silk. As a result, the prices of brands such as 3K rebounded by five yuan. Yokohama Japanese silk prices opened at only 665 yen. Although there were receipts of European and American white raw silk, the opening prices were not high. Various manufacturers maintained a firm stance due to cost considerations. Yesterday, only French firms imported 30 bales of ordinary grade 13-15 denier white raw silk from Sichuan factories, priced at 710 yuan. Xinfu imported 20 bales of KKK brand, priced at 660 yuan.

<p>New green tea in She County has been picked by mountain households for ten days. The early tea in Zhouwei has been harvested and processed. Only a few mountain late teas remain unsold. Many tea firms in the county are preparing to open their scales. Tea firms are scrambling to process new tea, but mountain prices cannot be lowered. However, new Zhenmei and new samples from Suian and Wenzhou soil firms in Shanghai have been released. Foreign merchants have changed their previous attitude of搶新搶新 grabbing new teas and are indifferent. The enthusiasm of She County tea firms has been greatly reduced. The store and storehouses in Jieyuan, Hubukou Street, and Jiekou sell baked green tea, Qingji and other gangs see foreign firms茶市不振The tea market is depressed, and the headquarters has telegraphed to reduce the amount of processing. They all advocate lowering the mountain prices for new tea. The previous price of 100 yuan was reduced to 80 yuan last week, and recently it has been depreciated to 60 yuan. The prices change throughout the day, making the mountain households complain incessantly.</p>

Each year, the new Zhenmei red disc has been preempted by Su茶茶tea. The firms have made considerable profits. Therefore, the Su茶tea firms趕早採製運滬趕早採製運滬rush to harvest, produce and transport it to Shanghai before the Grain Rain period every year. Last year, the tea from various roads in WuTun suffered losses, while the Su茶tea firms actually made profits. The tea merchants paid close attention to the operation of Su茶tea. This year, each firm still adopted the快摘快製主義快摘快製主義principle of quick picking and quick production and followed the usual practice of rushing the boxes to Shanghai. However, after the samples were displayed and discussed, the buyers became surprisingly cold. The market disc of covering the cost has never been opened. The firms received this warning and lowered the price to buy new ones. The Su安tea market suddenly showed a miserable decline. In recent days, the mountain price has fallen from 120 yuan to 50 yuan, and few people have been interested in it. The number merchants talk about tea色變The color change of tea, and are very anxious.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Changjiang Import運運transported more than 4,500 boxes of new Qimen black tea from Wuhu by wheel. Each warehouse house extracted samples for comparison. After negotiations between China and the West, the new disc has not been opened because the market disk is still far away. It is heard that there will be high-quality goods from the southwest roads of Qimen, which will continue to arrive today. The market may be launched. As for the sales of green tea, the goods from Suian and Wenzhou are very scarce. The business of local Zhuang Zhenmei is still not lonely, but the selling price is two or three yuan lower, and the situation is also difficult to consider optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Talking about "Dragon Boat Festival", "Dragon Boat Racing", "Strike" and "Resisting Insults", etc. <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>The "lunar calendar" has been abolished, and although many people say that they have gradually become accustomed to the "solar calendar." However, friends who "eat fast and chant Buddha" still firmly remember "the first day" and "the fifteenth day": filial sons and virtuous grandchildren who understand "wooden roots and water sources" and deeply remember their ancestors have not given up "Qingming" and "Zhongyuan." As for "Mid-Autumn Festival", "Dragon Boat Festival", "Lantern Festival" and the like, they are even more of a good time and festival that children and the general public are most willing and eager to arrive. I heard the old lady Wang next door say that the "Dragon Boat Festival" of "Gui You Year" is coming. She has already told her daughters-in-law to prepare the best "realgar" and "wormwood", and is rushing to make festive decorations such as "Dragon Boat Festival rope." According to A-Gen, her family's chauffeur, "The Dragon Boat Festival is really lively in the countryside, with dragon boat races and lantern shows!" Yes, yesterday's newspaper also told us that Jiading County, which has not had "dragon boat races" for many years, also has people initiating them this year. Dongmenwai, Nanmen Shigangmen, Ximenwai Gang, Beimen Loutang and other places have all held this grand event; however, unfortunately, when the enthusiastic members of the urban area were "holding books and stamping on various stores to launch the lantern show", they were spotted by the police captain of the county, and two people were immediately arrested, causing a police-civilian conflict, with dozens of people beaten to a bloody pulp! And the situation escalated, "the whole city went on strike! (See this newspaper on the 15th of this month for details)</p>
<p>Speaking of "strike", I can't help but think of the large-scale city-wide strike in Shanghai after "January 28th" (but I don't know if Jiading City also went on strike at that time? Because no one from Jiading has told me); speaking of "Jiading City", I also think of the Japanese planes that flew over their city last year to show off their power, and the bombs of one hundred and dozens of pounds also visited this "happy" land. The people of Jiading saw these things and were so frightened that their faces turned pale and they hid in the houses or cellars (but I don't know if these things still leave some vague shadows in the minds of the people of Jiading?) However, it is said that the strike in Shanghai last year was "resisting insults", and this strike in Jiading City, I think, is probably also "resisting insults." However, Shanghai is resisting insults because the Easterners want to occupy Zhabei, and Jiading City is resisting the insult of the police force because the dragon boat race cannot be held, which is slightly different. However, therefore, someone is asking: Why do you say that the people of Jiading City are striking to resist insults? Well, please listen to me:</p>
<p>(1) Because "dragon boat racing" is an inherent national essence of China. Preserving this national essence is as important as preserving antiquities and excavating ancient tombs;</p>
<p>(2) Because "dragon boat racing" is a happy act and also has a bit of celebration. Since the Eastern Xiaochilao did not bomb Jiading City like Zhabei in Shanghai last year, isn't this happy and worth celebrating enough?</p>
<p>(3) Although it is said that North China is in extreme danger now, fortunately, there are the mysterious predictions of the "sage" committee members of "the revolution will inevitably rise in that country in three years" and "waiting for fifty years", so we Jiading City is not Beiping City now, why don't we enjoy it?</p>
<p>(4) Sutras can save the country, dancing can also save the country, so of course "dragon boat racing" can also save the country!</p>
<p>………for these reasons, the police force did not know or understand these profound theories and dared to arbitrarily arrest reasonable people to the point of two people, isn't this a complete insult to the people of Jiading City? The people of Jiading City beat the police to a bloody pulp, and even evolved into a "city-wide strike". This is of course the most effective means of "resisting insults"…………</p>
<p>What's more, the fifth old lady next door to my house also said, "The police force is too unreasonable and should not be!"</p>
<h3 id="e234">News Brought by the Spring Breeze <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Friend, the spring break has long passed, and spring has quietly returned. I, who am busy with life, can leisurely sit on the Jinghu train. The reason is very simple. We poor people are not qualified to have travel interests. Sitting on the Jinghu train is still for the sake of life. Friend, do you know that I have recently OUt of Uob again in Shanghai?</p>
<p>Last year, you returned from the capital and said, "Places like the Confucius Temple are full of ugliness, and they try their best to interrogate young couples in hostels. This is the trick of our great country!" Friend, Zhenjiang is the same place.</p>
<p>After dinner with friends, a group of people stepped into Zhenjiang's only big hotel, Dahua Hotel. Although it also has facilities such as bathrooms, it is still below Central Shenzhou in comparison.</p>
<p>"Are there any flower girls here?" C joked in Shanghai-style Zhenjiang dialect:</p>
<p>"Are there flower girls?" The bellboy replied, "You can't come to the warehouse. If the room inspector finds out, they will be arrested." We all laughed at his fluent Zhenjiang dialect. C laughed even more: "Flower girls are probably not as fun as this bellboy!" After saying that, everyone laughed wildly again. The bellboy couldn't understand what we were saying and laughed inexplicably.</p>
<p>Of course, we couldn't go anywhere to play that day, but we couldn't fall asleep after only nine o'clock. My friend said, "Let's go to the red light district. I'll take you somewhere to play."</p>
<p>"Sir, you're from Zhenjiang!" The bellboy thought we were all from Shanghai. Hearing my friend's local language, he asked in surprise, "Then the gentleman will take you to the back street to play."</p>
<p>But my Zhenjiang friend was still acquainted in Shanghai. He goes home for a month every spring break. He knows where the back street is: he doesn't know where the girls in the back street are.</p>
<p>We arrived at Baota Lin, which is a public singing venue, with the same equipment as the former Great World Qunfang Hui singing hall. There is also a white-character water sign prohibiting strange noises, which was ordered by the Public Security Bureau. When the flower girls sang, their flirtatious eyes flew around. Perhaps knowing that we were from Shanghai, they especially posed.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man who looked like a smoker leaned over from behind me and whispered, "Old man, would you like to order a song?"</p>
<p>I asked my friend what the rules were. He said that was a pimp. If you take a fancy to a girl, order a few plays for her. Each play costs one yuan, and you can go to her house after the show. Friend, is the Confucius Temple probably the same kind of place?</p>
<p>Stepping out of Baota Lin, my friend met a veteran in the flowers and asked him to take us to the back street to play. The back street is a belt of small alleys, like the alleyways of Shanghai, but there are no signs like red lights. You can't ask for directions without acquaintances. With the permission of that gentleman, we sat down in a house called Something Lan. Because it was Saturday, many masters from the XX Bureau and Hall were there drinking and gambling. The patrol police outside were like nothing had happened. According to that gentleman, our Special Generation is not the era where colleagues were killed. It was because of exposing this kind of trick.</p>
<p>I hope this letter will not be checked, otherwise Shanghai will have to hold a big meeting again. I have already set the itinerary for tonight, and will return to Shanghai in at most five days. I have bought half a dozen Zhenjiang vinegar as a gift for your wife. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Li Shu</p>
<p>"Foreign goods are better than domestic goods." A chubby, blonde-haired child was standing lively on the ground in the park, stumbling and falling as she imitated running, babbling in her heavenly language to the nanny sitting on the chair. Out of curiosity, I walked over and picked her up. She smiled, her small eyes narrowing to a line. I kissed her, and she seemed shyly to avoid me, still uttering "Ba...Ba" sounds from her little mouth.</p>
<p>When she saw Chinese people, she would call them "Papa."</p>
<p>The nanny explained her intention to me.</p>
<p>"Her father is Chinese, right?" "Yes." Indeed, Chinese raw materials made into goods in foreign factories are exceptionally beautiful.</p>
<p>"Her parents must love her very much?"</p>
<p>"This little girl is with me. Her father loves her even more."</p>
<p>"How much do you earn a month?"</p>
<p>"Including food, four dollars a month. I don't want to. It's still better in a local family."</p>
<p>"What? Isn't it the same as a Chinese family?"</p>
<p>"Humph! Her mother is really annoying. She's unclear about things and nags endlessly, and there are so many trivial matters."</p>
<p>"What about her father?"</p>
<p>"He works in a foreign firm. He's also afraid of her mother." She scolds him too, and sometimes he even has to kneel before her. Her father is very docile, it's really funny.</p>
<p>"They are happy!"</p>
<p>"Oh, too cheesy and unsightly. When they go out, they always kiss, and it's the same when they come back."</p>
<p>"This is Westernization."</p>
<p>"Alright, you say Westernization. She doesn't want us to speak Chinese. She says it's too stupid and doesn't sound good. Sometimes her father tells the little girl to speak Chinese, and she scolds him too!"</p>
<p>"Marrying a foreign wife, does he have to act like a foreigner too?" "No, her mother has a fortune. I heard he went to study in France relying on her."</p>
<p>Oh! I understand. I gave the little girl a kiss and went to stroll elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Separated by a Single Wall <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>Life in Shanghai is truly interesting. A small shikumen house is home to as many as five or six families: one in the front building, one in the back building, one in the garret, one in the kitchen annex, one in the main room, and another in the loft. In total, there are dozens of people, big and small, men and women. However, despite living together, they never exchange a single word, as if they are determined to never interact with each other. Perhaps this is the source of the Shanghainese pride that makes them who they are.</p>
<p>My neighbor is separated from me only by a thin wall. Through the cracks in the wall, we can see each other. I have to walk past their door to enter or leave. Because the corridor is narrow, when we bump into each other, we press ourselves against the wall with our backs facing each other, as if we were strangers passing on the street. Only now do I understand the purpose of the wall; it seems that a single wall can separate you as if you were separated by a mountain!</p>
<p>My neighbor's dwelling is only about the size of two and a half eight-immortal tables. Yet, there are as many as eight people living inside. These people sleep inside like sardines in olive oil. Because summer has arrived, these sardines emit a stench that makes people afraid to approach.</p>
<p>I have no idea what noble occupation my neighbor engages in. They sleep during the day, although they also eat, but they sleep after eating. Nighttime is when they become active. The bedding is rolled up, and they immediately start playing mahjong with a clatter. The sounds of the tiles being shuffled, the loud shouts of "Pong!", the cries of calculating points,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>and the noisy arguments reverberate like thunder. They play until dawn, when they finally call it quits and fall asleep. My neighbor never cares about others. He is Chinese, and the world revolves around him. Therefore, under their noisy shouting, separated by a thin wall, I can only stare with wide eyes, lying in bed, being sacrificed by them. I am suffering from insomnia! Although I have told my neighbor to change to daytime, I don't have the authority to change their national character. However, when they are sleeping, even during the day, if someone makes noise, they will be subjected to his cursing of "your mother" and "pig."</p>
<p>The neighbor next door, as well as the neighbors upstairs and downstairs who are a bit further away, get up early in the morning and line up their chamber pots under the tap. After they "swish, swish, swish" for a while, they "whoosh" dump it out there. They spit everywhere, throw away cigarette butts, fruit peels, and paper scraps... No one interferes with any of this. These families live together, each for themselves. Although they may sweep their own little room, the public areas, such as the corridor, stairs, drying platform, and area around the tap, are never taken care of.</p>
<p>In the end, I had to move, leaving them to it. But wherever I moved, the situation was much the same.</p>

<h3 id="e239">The Confessions of a Nurse <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Fen</p>
<p>Many people constantly strive to seize every opportunity to tell others about their sufferings and grievances, hoping to gain people's sympathy. Although this is the dumbest thing to do, I am one of them. Now I want to tell you about everything about myself.</p>
<p>I believe what I write here is by no means my own abnormal state, but a sketch of the lives of nurses in general. Of course, this is what those gentlemen who care about social problems want to know.</p>
<p>I am an orphaned girl who lost her parents early in life and has not received people's love since childhood. I have no money, and I have no way to obtain higher education. Although I managed to graduate from a primary school, the education I received was very poor. Later, because there was no opportunity to make a living in the countryside, and I had to live, I had no choice but to follow an uncle to Shanghai to struggle as much as possible. The means of this struggle was to become a nurse.</p>
<p>When I mention the word nurse, I think you will think that their lives must be too romantic, especially if you are a man who has stayed in the hospital, then I guess accurately, you will immediately float up that kind of young and lively smile wearing a white cloth on your head. Perhaps this smile will never fade in your memory, but precisely because of this, our pain and sorrow will not be understood by people at all. In your eyes, we are bound to be prostitutes, or, to put it nicely, "great lovers" with many men.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not my own deliberate defilement, but in fact many vicious men have told me bluntly. At first, hearing such words, I was naturally angry and had to argue with him, but later I heard such words more and more, so I had to let them say it.</p>
<p>Why stop others from talking? In order to live, we have to work, we have to spend at least ten hours a day in the ward pouring chamber pots, making beds, feeding tea and rice, clearing bowels, and washing festering boils. And when the patient has a fever that is too high and goes mad, how can we violate the orders of the doctor and head nurse and not cater to them? Even holding a strange man and kissing is unavoidable. As for the bloody blood of the parturient women, it is enough to make people vomit. Other things like plugging the ears and mouths of the dead are also our daily meals. Although watching a person die in the dead of night cannot help but tremble.</p>
<p>Look! This is the life of me and our companions. Blood, corpses, urine, feces fatigue, fainting.</p>
<p>So, how should I comfort myself? There are many self-proclaimed virtuous men and women who explain it to us very nicely: "Love", "Mercy", "For God", "For saving the world", hum! Dog shit, get out, I have been anesthetized enough by you. And what I comfort myself with is that I have not starved to death until now.</p>
<p>So what am I hoping for? Where is our way out? In a word, I hope to use our own strength to improve our treatment, reduce working hours, follow the broad masses of toiling people, and move forward to create the world.</p>

<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am a rice store accountant. Seven years ago, a neighbor introduced my second daughter to marry the only son of a Zhou family in the same village who owned some land. Since the Shanghai war broke out, after she saw him once, she often expressed her unwillingness to marry such an ugly tenant farmer as her husband. So I also deeply regretted it.</p>
<p>Today is the ninth day after their marriage. The first time she entered the room, she never wanted to sleep with her husband. She sat alone on the chair and cried all night: so they have no love between them. Now the other party has sent a matchmaker to say: if it continues like this, it will be resolved by law.</p>
<p>Sir, I am really in trouble. If I send someone to persuade her, she will not listen; if I say that it will be resolved by law, then it is related to face. Please give me a gospel! I wish you good health. Zhuang Liansheng respectfully</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Editor's note: This matter, Zhuang Jun's current situation, is indeed extremely difficult. But thinking carefully, this kind of trouble is also brought by yourself. Your daughter, after all, has expressed her unwillingness to marry before, so you should explain to the other party and cancel the marriage contract. Fortunately, the law stipulates that "marriage contracts made by parents can be terminated if the children express their opposition after reaching adulthood." Even if there is some argument, it is much easier to handle than the current situation. Now, after hoping that persuading her to not change, there is only one way to listen to her divorce. However, even if a divorce can be obtained at present, the amount of compensation you have to pay to the other party will definitely be very considerable. The money they spent at the wedding must be compensated in full. If it is not handled well, you will have to pay a sum of money, which is called "consolation money" in law, as compensation for the other party's mental loss. This is a certain and inevitable result. You should still entrust the original matchmaker to discuss and discuss it to avoid getting involved in litigation and spending unnecessary money. If the negotiation is not settled, then you have to wait for the law to resolve it. As for face or no face, there is no need to worry too much about it.</p>

<h3 id="e243">The Life of the Five Beauties (12) (Continued) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>(11) The Best Years</p>
<p>Since Miss Liu was determined to live a new life, she moved from Beijing to Shanghai. The reason was very simple, because Beijing only had that dry air, which made her feel bored, which made her not have enough confidence to keep her youth. However, is this the only reason? This point, even those closest to her such as Wu Gui, could not understand, I am afraid only she herself would fully know.</p>
<p>But since Wu Gui followed Miss Liu to Shanghai, he always felt much more glorious than before. The most obvious thing was that he was already the official housekeeper, and such a rich family was actually a large mansion, and many nannies and servants had to be commanded by him. Of course, it was enough to be majestic.</p>
<p>Moreover, not only that, but everything in this house made him happy. For example, there was such a small garden outside the gate. In addition to roses in spring and chrysanthemums in autumn, he could also plant some balsams by hand in summer. However, Miss Liu was always not very fond of balsams, and she also disliked daffodils in winter, which he could not agree with Miss Liu. As for the furnishings in the house, he admired Miss Liu for being indeed capable. He didn't know where she bought so many exquisite furniture, such as that kind of strangely soft sofa, that kind of embroidered carpet, and those tea tables of different sizes. However, the arrangement method was completely different from Wu Gui's. He advocated placing a tea table between two grand master chairs, but she wanted to place the tea table crookedly next to the sofa, which was too irregular. As for placing a large bed in the middle of the house, it was also not very elegant. However, according to Miss Liu, this was the Western style. Although sleeping and eating did not necessarily have to be the same as Westerners, her own master must do so, and she deliberately learned it from other people's homes, perhaps all large mansions should be like this, so over time, she got used to it.</p>
<p>However, everything here was related to Miss Liu's position in the world, including that Italian breed of puppy specially selected for fifty silver dollars. For example, the guests who came here were all powerful bigwigs of today, and sometimes even foreigners wearing diamond pins on their ties would come to visit in cars. Therefore, the master's social circle was so wide that it was possible. Since this was the case, the equipment in the family had to be magnificent. As for having a puppy snuggled in her arms in the car, it seemed very appropriate, because not only foreign wives were like this, but Chinese gentlemen's wives had also learned this. Then Miss Liu was in fact the lover of gentlemen, so in every subtle action, she had to conform to the style of the wives, and things like bringing puppies were just basic conditions.</p>
<p>All in all, Miss Liu lived a very peaceful life for a long time, and Wu Gui could not help but feel relaxed when he thought of the scene back then.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Joint Discussion of Peach Blossom Village and Spring River Flower Moon Night <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>A New Contribution After European Films Changed Their Style</p>
<p>A New Art of Melting Music and Film into One</p>
<p>European film production giant Eurik Pommer once said: "The duty of a film is to use entertainment to make people forget all worries, sorrows and unfortunate impressions. Nothing in the world can be as popular as a movie, because all mankind needs entertainment and craves entertainment. Therefore, entertainment films mixed with music are more popular; as for problem films, they can only win the welcome of a part of people in a limited social context." Whether what he said is right or wrong is another question. However, European films have recently changed their style under the influence of this argument, and the result has been successful.</p>
<p>We only need to look at the "Peach Blossom Village" Happy Ever After, which is now opening in Shaanxi, and the "Spring River Flower Moon Night" that has already been shown, are they not both using music to create poetic works? Then whether the audience welcomes it or not has already been proven by facts. Some people say that this kind of musical film is already a work of the past era in the United States. But you need to know that they are original and unique, and they infuse the harmonious art of music into the art of film. The American song and dance films that were popular a few years ago simply sent music to a dead end. They are completely different, which is because of good and bad use.</p>
<p>Speaking of the plot of these two films, they are certainly very simple: but they all carry some humorous mood in the simple. "Spring River Flower Moon Night" satirizes a group of philistines who blindly praise artists. The story of "Peach Blossom Village" satirizes European stars who only want to run to Hollywood. Indeed, as long as European stars on the screen or stage have a little reputation, they are immediately recruited by the United States. European filmmakers of course express dissatisfaction. But unfortunately, the heroine of "Peach Blossom Village," Lilin Howard, also finally went down this road. The magic power of money and vanity is indeed not small!</p>
<p>Speaking of skills, of course each has its own advantages. Photography and shooting in "Spring River Flower Moon Night" is pure art; while the photography of "Peach Blossom Village" uses some magic. The singing in "Spring River Flower Moon Night" is better than "Peach Blossom Village". But the expression of "Peach Blossom Village" is better than "Spring River Flower Moon Night" because they are all actors who can act. Furthermore, "Spring River Flower Moon Night" is completely a comedy, while "Peach Blossom Village" contains some bitterness in the laughter. Many places in the second half are full of sorrow. In short, these two films are no less than famous European works and are very worth appreciating.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e245">Review of "The Black Night Rope Shadow" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The Black Night Rope Shadow (The Case of the Frightened Lady) – adapted from a novel into a stage play, and then from a stage play into a film. It is very famous in Europe and America. I remember that seven or eight years ago, there was an American silent film that was derived from this script, but the result was not as satisfactory as the stage play. This time it is produced by British Lion Film Corporation. It is really unexpected. America has been lively with horror films for a while, and Britain is actually using such a bizarre film to speculate.</p>
<p>The story is simply about a hereditary knight with a history of hereditary mental illness. When the disease occurs, he often kills people with a rope. Six people have been killed before and after. The police investigated the murderer, but found no clues. Soon, when the knight's old illness relapsed, he explained all the murders to the detective, and took out a pistol to prevent the detective from arresting him. Unexpectedly, when he moved his finger, he shot himself to death.</p>
<p>If you didn't know the story before watching the film, it would be difficult for you to guess who the murderer is, because the knight's mother is also highly suspected, and the two servants are also suspected of being murderers.</p>
<p>In terms of drama, the greatest contribution is maternal love. The knight's mother is an extremely shrewd and fierce woman, but she uses all kinds of methods to protect her son, and she also chooses a good daughter-in-law. On the one hand, she sees her capable skills, and on the other hand, she promotes great maternal love.</p>
<p>The director is not bad, and the structure is acceptable, but why does the girl pick up the rope when the detective goes to the knight's house to investigate? There is a room that the owner is not allowed to unlock. This loophole is lightly written in the film, but it is the director's fault. The light tends to be terrifyingly dark, which is quite suitable for the appropriate situation. Although there are few exterior scenes, they are all good. The interior scenes are really like those described in the original book, and they are also in line with the old residence of the knight. The photography is very novel, using a large number of overhead shots and仰攝, which is quite eye-catching, but unfortunately the "rope shadow" shots are too short and too few, which is slightly suspected of being slack.</p>
<p>Emlyn Williams, who plays the knight, only has the last monologue, which is the most exciting, with a painful and profound expression that is exceptionally moving. Cathleen Nesbilt, who plays the knight's mother, is also the best at the end. In the first half, she can only show a capable old woman, but she cannot show the attitude of a loving mother's hard work. The knight's fiancée is played by Belle Chrystall, who looks frightened everywhere. She provides the most horror colors for the whole film. The rest of the actors are the same as the above three protagonists, and their performances are ordinary, so there is no need to mention them.</p>
<p>In this film, there is no interlude to speak of. Originally, there is no need for interludes in this type of film, but a detective named Gordon Harker has some humorous words and actions, such as eating candy in the lecture hall, which are quite interesting.</p>
<p>As for the dialogue, like other British films, many funny places are contained in the dialogue.</p>
<p>I suspect that this is an old film from three years ago. Not only are the front-of-house staff lists and film titles not as new as in recent years, but the film also broke twice. However, whether it is a new product or an old product, it will not disappoint people anyway.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Review of "The Flower of Hell" <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Simple Directing Technique</p>
<p>Excellent Performance by the Protagonist</p>
<p>In a realistic society where love is built on the foundation of money, this film "The Flower of Hell" (She Done Him Wrong) is indeed very appropriate to seize this real subject matter and expose it to the fullest. Lady Lou, a singer, in order to exchange her love for men's diamonds, spares no effort to show off her charm, causing many men to fall for her and be imprisoned for her crimes. Regarding this matter, many enthusiastic audiences will inevitably scold her as a "heartless妖婦", but the "love trade" in modern society will not be eliminated by this scolding. On the contrary, if we can gain some reflection, we should also give credit to this film. However, should we completely agree with the entire plot? No, when Detective Cummings led the police to arrest all these "villains", the detective finally fell in love with the dancer's beauty and released her out of love, even to the point of getting married and living together, which is very vulgar and unreasonable. Of course, we don't have to say that all sins should be attributed to this singer alone, but that the evil society made her and him commit crimes, but in terms of the plot itself, in order to make the plot quite reasonable, this singer should be brought to justice and punished. Moreover, from the point of view of "maintaining the spirit of the rule of law," how can this murderer escape justice? But the only explanation is that "she also worked hard for local public welfare," which precisely exposes the contradictions of capitalist films. Secondly, American movies still have to maintain the old tune of "lovers getting married."</p>
<p>As for the performance skills of this film, what I am most satisfied with is the success of the performance. Indeed, the heroine Mae West fully grasped the characteristics of this typical woman. She is so generous, and she is so calm in times of crisis, fully displaying her own dignity. She directs men to fight for her with extremely subtle movements. She seduces with sensuality, she fascinates with sound and color, but she is not exaggerated at all, completely removing the vulgar performance methods of "lust" and "heat." As for her singing voice, it is also very peculiar and moving. If, as the advertisement says, this is still her debut work, then we believe that she will definitely be a very promising "花且" in the future.</p>
<p>However, the success of the heroine is of course due to the director's efforts. In this film, we can see the director's exquisite techniques. He believes that music can help express emotions, so he accompanies the melodious love words with extremely low music. The heroine shines in the glittering golden jewelry and singing, fully expressing the golden beauty. Other small actions of the actors can also show the director's meticulousness. However, there are no particularly commendable shots in the entire film, and it is not successful in terms of mood, which is inevitably a lack.</p>
<p>I don't want to say much about other points. Anyway, they are all above the standard. In short, in terms of skills, this film is very satisfying.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e247">Review of "New Year's Eve" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Du Cunjie</p>
<p>Liu Jiqun and Chen Yanyan's Performances are Realistic</p>
<p>The Lianhua Film Company's newly produced "New Year's Eve" has been hyped for a long time, and finally premiered in "Beijing" today. After watching it, I think it is not bad, and there is nothing disappointing. Its story is based on tragedy as the background, depicting the morbidity of the times and the one-sidedness of urban social life. It can be called a tearful smile that satirizes the reality of life.</p>
<p>Its consciousness is very good; the three leading actors, Liu Jiqun, Chen Yanyan, and Jiang Junchao are also good. Especially Liu Jiqun and Chen Yanyan's expressions are very realistic, but the directing is a little bit imperfect; for example, in the scene when the old man asked and realized that it was the money for pawning his daughter, he couldn't help but jump up... At this point, Ms. Huang Yunzhen, who plays the old man's wife, her expression at the time only said that her daughter was willing to pawn herself to the third sister-in-law in exchange for money. Anyway, her daughter will always follow someone when she grows up. At this time, she doesn't have much sadness or resentment, since she is talking about her own flesh and blood, then this seems a bit unreasonable. The rest is pretty good. Overall, this film does not disappoint people.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Review of Dancing in "New Year's Eve" <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Mengxuan</p>
<p>The dance scene interspersed in the middle of "New Year's Eve" is inevitably a bit far-fetched in terms of plot. Imagine that in this short period of time, a woman with unstable emotions is forced to learn to dance. No matter how easy dancing is, in fact, she will never learn the basic movements two or three times and be able to accompany the dance. An even more obvious loophole is that she has already made a lot of jokes about stepping on feet and bumping into people in public, and there are still many dancers rushing to ask her to accompany the dance!</p>
<p>In short, I think the director failed in "New Year's Eve." This is not because of a few small loopholes, but because he did not have a strict analysis of the personality of each character, which is the biggest reason for his failure.</p>
<h3 id="e249">The White Sister (3) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>

<p>Sacrificing Reputation and Happiness for Love</p>
<p>Mina suddenly let out a cry, saying that her handbag had been snatched by a person standing next to her. Please Angela wait here, she went breathlessly to chase that person in the crowded crowd. Giovani took the opportunity to test whether Angela needed his help. She felt a little scared and a little unhappy about this behavior, so she twisted her eyebrow and only said, "Whatever you want." This slender soldier frankly said that he didn't want to go out, but wanted to talk to her.</p>
<p>"Oh!" His face flushed. "You should help. An old woman's purse has been stolen."</p>
<p>"I'll go find her. Please wait here. This is a whistle." He took it off from the rope circle around his neck. "If you're scared, you can blow it," he said, and rushed into the crowd. He stood on a square for a while, looking around blankly. In the sea of ​​merrymakers, he couldn't see the fat old woman, so he hurriedly ran back.</p>
<p>Angela sat at a table placed by the roadside of a small cafe. The melodious violin music came from the cafe.</p>
<p>"I can't find her," Giovani said. "You better wait here. I'm afraid everyone won't be able to find you if you leave. Why don't we go into the cafe? We can have some tea. Don't you trust me?"</p>
<p>"Just... father," she hesitated. "What if he finds out..."</p>
<p>"Are you very afraid of him?" the man asked.</p>
<p>"I love him very much!" she said, following Giovani into the cafe. "Is your surname郎杜?" She asked shyly as he dragged a chair for her to sit down and ordered tea.</p>
<p>"Who is he?" the man's eyes searched her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh... he's just... a friend of my friend. You know, he wears black boots and rides a white horse. Is it a coincidence? He is very moving."</p>
<p>"Very moving," Giovani's eyes shot into her eyes in agreement. "You are very moving!" Angela heard this and stood up to leave. Giovani offered a shy retention, and she sat down again. The soft violin music filled the air. The waiter brought the tea. Giovani laughed and talked, and Angela listened silently, his eyes shining with new brilliance, and her heart beating happily.</p>
<p>"What happened later?" she asked urgently as soon as he stopped.</p>
<p>"Later I joined the army."</p>
<p>"Yes... I saw a soldier." Angela looked down at the tea leaves at the bottom of her teacup.</p>
<p>"Did he fall in love?" Giovani asked urgently. (To be continued)</p>
