<p>日本自退出國聯而後。在軍事上固已取得侵略之便利。實現其數十年來制霸東亞大陸之野心。但外交上則陷於孤立狀態。英國原爲日本之同盟國在遠東政治上之利害關係。與日本素極接近。對蘇聯主張亦稱一致。然而經濟聯盟運動旣興。日本欲把持遠東。先倡所謂「日滿聯盟」繼則隱示與歐美對立之意思。故英日之間早有裂痕。頃自世界經濟會議失敗國際合作與國家經濟的閉關主義。矛盾益顯。主要各國遂皆致力於鎖國自衛日本對外政策。至此乃亦根本轉變。彼雖不能再接對英衝突。惟於南洋印度之市塲。已與英國處於敵對地位。而在北滿與蘇聯。勢尤急激。現在世人皆知蘇聯與日本傀儡之間。正在東京進行中東路出售問題。蘇聯在表面上固仍續持其和平主張。有以相當價格出售之表示。而在日本及其傀儡。則正欲擴張其軍事實力於東北。又從經濟的立塲侵蝕中東路。使受日軍及「滿鐵」之二重挾制。冀以賤價刦取中東路也</p>
<p>其所以積極刦取中東路。不待吉會路延吉三姓路拉賓路之完成者。蓋以現世各國。莫不努力於自已國内之建設。對於國際。則多傾心於自給自足而力圖充實其軍備也。日本在此時期中。見積極侵略政策。已有效果。乃欲實行其更進一步之侵略。從前之所謂軍事。尚借口於防備赤化。維持遠東和平今則謂從前在東北三省之軍事狀態臨時處理之時期。已成過去此後在東北將永久駐兵。設置常備師團。其數目幾何。司令部設於何地。雖未確定而欲常駐重兵於東北。在我東三省及熱河境内。構築陣地。爲將來國際戰爭之準備。則瞭無可疑。此爲日本積極備戰之一也。再者日本今年預算。陵軍軍費支出總計。不過四億四千八百萬日金。海軍不過三億七千五百萬日。金而明年度之軍費預算。其數字雖未確定。陸軍方面之需求。將不下於五億五千萬。海軍有新規建艦計劃。其費用恐將超過六億。即以陸海軍費論。非特準戰時預算而已。且進而至於戰時預算。此日本積極備戰之二也。現在日本之向海外發展在東北雖可稱爲得手。但仍不能濟彼之急。而印度南洋等有望市塲。又皆</p>
<p>受英帝國内經濟聯盟之制限。故仍注意於我國本部。一面圖經濟勢力之擴張一面爲政治上之挑撥。恐嚇我與國聯使停止技術上之合作。彼乃得而乘機獨占。此日本積極備戰之三也。吾人固深知日本爲海國强大之陸軍不在對蘇聯。即在對我國。今則以中東路問題作楔機。西鎖滿洲里。東封綏芬河且爲種種對蘇宣傳。謂蘇聯赤軍在東部西比利亞積極佈防即可借口向東北四省大舉增兵此日本積極備戰之四也</p>
<p>有茲四者。中日關係雖因華北愶定而暫趨緩和。然日本對華政策。並未變更。則所謂和平者。不過爲外交上騙人之名詞而已。</p>

<p>丨神兵隊的大暗殺計劃未能實行丨</p>
<p>日本國内在表面上自從去年五月十五日、海陸軍現役將校白晝持槍殺死首相犬養毅之後、經軍部與政府恊力鎭撫、總算動亂沒有繼續擴大、在左翼方面的行動、自然到處受法律及法律指導下的警察嚴重取締、祇有地下活動、日常的鬭爭、只在經濟方面和文化上略有表示而已、可是右翼諸團體就大不相同了、他們旣有相當的中流資本家作財政背景、又有陸海軍部作政治上的後援、所以縱令政府方面、有限制其活動的意思、但　　的權力、决不能及於軍部、所以右翼團體的活動、俠舊十分活潑而有力、雖　、他們的行動、嚴格講起來是非合法的、但是他們的運動、得到軍部的默契、得到在鄉軍人會直接問的援助、甚至有許多現役將校加入、經過了一種轉折而助給他們的武器、所以右翼團體的運動、在去年一年中曾表示過很詭怪的力量、財閥的巨頭團琢磨·政黨的要角井上準之助、以及當國首相犬養毅、都先後被刺、這就顯示着右傾運動的抬頭、并不見得就是日本統治者的福利、</p>
<p>况且日本的右傾諸團體、雖然大都以「日本精神」相號召、但其出發點、總是不滿於日本的現狀、對日本的政治上經濟上一般情形、都表示着極度的憤恨、特别是日本侵略了「滿洲」之後、日本民間一般的困苦、生活的困苦、失業的困苦、農村經濟的停滯、較之九一八以前并未改善、而凖戰時的軍事費用、都以公債的名目、加在一般平民身上、於是人民的怨恨愈深、潛伏着的危機也就越大、右翼諸團體的運動、旣趨於急進之途、用合法的招牌、對政治的當權者、議會政治的擁護者財閥等等、實行恐怖政策、</p>
<p>因此東京大阪等重要都市、都發生一種極度不安的恐怖心理、特别是那些負責任的大官（但軍事長官除外）財閥政黨領袖、莫不嚴重戒備、惟恐大難降臨、</p>
<p>大日本生產黨在右翼團體中是尖銳分子的集團、他們的行動、非當激越、對現政府取直接行動、他們爲了保持秘密的關係起見、在事前不開幹部會議、也不採用合議制的形式、祇是少數幹部的集合來計劃他們的工作、他們對於一切未來的計劃、固然保持着絶對的秘密、即實施的工作、也不輕易呌外人知道、不意他們的計劃、竟被警察當局偵破了、</p>
<p>在生產黨指揮之下、有個神兵隊的組織、這個神兵隊、更是尖銳分子的先鋒、他們唯一的作法、就是「一個人暗殺一個、」這次生產黨靑年黨部長鈴木善一、突然下非常召集令、於本月十日午後十二時、在「明治神宮」的「神宮講會館」集合、密謀起事、當時警察看見這一批人十分奇異、立即報告警察總監、纔由「原宿警署」下令動員警察、將參加的人一律逮捕、共計</p>
<p>捉到十一個人、於是纔曉得他們的計劃、是要在七月十一日午前十一時先行襲擊東京市内某火藥店、取得手槍炸彈和其他武器、然後分做三隊、第一隊隊長爲前田宮雄、參謀長爲鈴木善一、目標是襲擊首相官邸、刺殺齋藤實首相之後、再去刺殺各部大臣、第二隊内村岡淸藏領率、目標是包圍警察和各警署、使警察陷於不能活動的狀態、則東京立即陷於無政府狀態、第三隊由景山政治指揮、先搗毁政友會民政黨國同俱樂部、然後刺殺牧野伸顯伯爵、鈴木喜三郎政友會總裁、若槻禮次郎民政黨總裁、還有其他的財閥、他們都預備要一網打盡、殊不知事機不密、在十一個鐘頭以前、被人識破、九個鐘頭、</p>
<p>以前破敗、否則東京又要遭一塲非常的大亂、</p>
<p>現時珔在搜查這件案子的關係、惟陸海軍兩方的負責人、都公式申明軍部與此並無關係、并呌大家安心、空前的大案、總算是暫時彌縫著了、（七月十九日於東京）</p>

<p>春秋苦熱與驅蚊  淸癯　　以前春秋上說「天不爲人之惡其寒而輟其冬，」吾現在把他下一轉語，說「天何不爲人之惡其熱而輟其夏」，想大家處在火傘高張炎威逼人的當兒，必定是人人聽得進，雖也有說暑天到底比冬天寒冷的時候好過，因爲世界上可以穿重裘，燒火爐，住在温暖的密室　過日子的，畢竟是少數，而　霜雪，衝嚴寒，勞苦的人們，不知幾千幾萬，不看見大雪紛飛，街頭瑟縮的，常常會被深夜裏冷氣所侵襲，遂致　凍而成路斃的這種　事麽？那末，照這樣講，夏天熱度雖高，而一般窮民到佔了便宜不少，就是露宿風棲，也正在過着最舒適的生活哩！　　不過這是就一端而論，倘眞從利害上分别起來，盛暑天氣，就是人生之大敵，什麽緣故，一到酷熱光景，無論何人，都要感受着幾穩不耐煩的苦處，淺點講，小小的蚊蟲，天生成的一張利嘴，你！到疲倦時，要在睡鄉裏，享個一枕黑甜的風味，也被他嗡嚨嗡嚨，閙個魂夢不安，不但擾人淸夢，而且還要吸人膏血，若不用手去撲得他們身如粉齎，那蚊子的肚皮就吸飽了，好像一盞紅紗燈，臨了飛去，　呌一聲，「你好醒未」？前天有一位朋友爲了蚊蟲。發生一番妙倫，有人勸他買一匣豬牌蚊烟香，保可一個一個的殺盡，不致受他苦了，豈料這位朋友聽了，大以爲不然。說道，吾終不願去拿日本的東西來害中國的蚊蟲，寗蚊蟲來吸吾鮮血，不肯聽日本人來送我的生命，唉！這幾句話，眞有些幽默的意味，値得去體會啊！　　其實要除蚊蟲，也並非難事，苟庭院裏，不留靑草，不積汚水，這種卵子，就不會繁殖，卽日用的水缸，也最容易產生蚊蟲，然而要滅其種子，只須取螺絲幾粒，養在水中，缸内的孑孑就沒有了，内地本較爲潔凈，苟非閙市，臭蟲一物，本來不會光降，所苦的不過一種蚊蟲，但在預先謹防，這種蟲類，不是無法驅除呢？就是蒼蠅，倘注意淸潔兩字，也無從來侵略，以致有害衛生，至於熱的煩悶，你！若胸中以爲不熱，那就不會汗流浹背，所謂「心定自然凉」，這是心理和生理往往有關係的，有時苦熱得十二分，試一想着「高臺吹夕風，素月照東楹，當户理新曲，淸暉滿瑤箏，仰視孤雁飛，俛聽哀蛩鳴」的景象，不由得凉　習習，襲我肘腋，恍到了一處淸凉的世界，換了别有天地，好不快樂啊！夏耘  茸餘　　氣候是這樣的熱，太陽像火傘一般的張着；小河裏的水，晒得起一個個小泡兒，似在沸滾着。這時的鄉下人，不論男的女的，都要下田工作。綠油油的稻秧，已經有一尺多高，很整齊的排列着。它們需要太陽照着，纔得生長。它們需要水分灌漑，纔不枯萎。它們也需人肥料澆裹，纔能欣榮。它們更需要把雜草除去。纔能平安地生着。農夫爲適應它們的環境；也可說希望自已的收成好。所以在這烈日底下，帶着箬笠，赤着雙脚，下田去工作。那稻田中的水，像沸滾一般的　人。還有螞蝗·水蛭，拚命地來咬你。渾身的汗珠，像噴水池般湧出。一身的皮膚。晒得像銅人般的烏黑。耘田·拔草·車水·一天天的忙着。他們連歇午覺，扇蒲扇的分兒都沒有，拚命地做着做着。年成好的話兒，自已好留一些飯米。要是逢着水旱蝗災，只落得一塲辛苦，空費勞碌。正是「採得百花釀蜜後，爲誰辛苦爲誰忙。」堪爲農人吟咏咧！　　棉花雖沒有稻禾般煩瑣，可是泥常常要爬鬆。這爬泥的工作，是在根的四周，慢慢的鋤着，不可大刀闊斧般的胡弄。還有去除雜草，三日兩頭去工作。天氣越是熱，草越是生得快，而除草的工作，越是忙了。赤日當空，女子頭上包着一塊毛巾；男子帶着箬笠，也在拚命地做着做着。「時人不識農家苦，將謂田中榖自生」都市中人得來容易，却不知稼穡的艱難。有空的時候，請他們到鄉間去參觀一下，纔知道「日常盤中飱，粒粒皆辛苦」咧！冷語  俞友淸　　坐在電風扇下的人們喊熱，在街上拖車的人力車夫也喊熱，這是熱的平等，無分貧富。　　時髦小姐們露了腿，和苦力們赤了膊，上下相同，表示男女平權的初步。睡在碧紗廚中的人們，或者不及睡在水門汀上的人們來得舒服甜蜜，很有哲學意味。　　女人面上祗有紅白黑，紅的嘴，白的臉，黑的頭髮和眉毛。東北四連長  張恨水　　第十二回　　寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍犧牲甘解甲戰士多情　　假使我是楊桂枝的話，我心裏一定是這樣的想着，趙家那天應當來提親了，那天應當來文定了，那天應當擇定喜期了。在一個要作新娘子的人，對於這種事情，都少不得一樣一樣去想象的。然而自已若是不回去的話，那會讓他第一個啞謎就揭不開來，他豈不要大爲揥興之下？楊家的事，自已是知道的，這婚姻在桂枝本人，可以作一半主。現在若把桂枝得罪了，就是這件事，有一多半難望成功。萬一事情壞了，那豈不是合了一句俗話，把煑熟的鴨子給飛了。如此一想，他心理的事，放擱不下，那裏睡得安穩？一人在床舖上，翻身向裏睡一會，又翻身向外睡一會，眼睛雖然閉着，神經倒更是銳敏，醒着的時候，所不能想到的事，於今都想到了，假使我現在把楊桂枝娶到手了，以後我就眞正的有了家，免得父親帶了一個聽差，住在一所深院子裏，縫聯補破，燒火煑飯，一切都是自已料理，彷彿是個掛單的和尚。等到有了兒媳婦進門，這些問題，自然，也就迎刃而解。再過兩年，我父親一定可以抱孫子了。到了那個時候，我就是隨軍在外，也有人安慰我的父親。我不必像現在一樣，覺的老是對父親不住了。他越想却越是興奮，越興奮却也越是要想。自已也有點醒悟，這樣的想不去，何時爲止，非想到天亮不可！眞想到了天亮，明天起來，當然，不能有什麽精神。軍人是首重振作精神的，若是明天就是檢閱的日子，自已沒有精神，那如何能對付過去這一個難關，自已趕快去休養精神罷，養好了精神，渡過這個難關以後，再來安心安意的進行婚事，那總不算遲。今天晚上，第一項工作還是睡，别的可以不想了。於是按住了心上的思潮，下决心去睡。（一三八）夏夜的斜橋  虎頭　　上海原是樂土。大槪沒有到過上海的人，或者羨慕着要到上海來的人，都有這麽念頭。看看十里洋塲，金迷紙醉，自是人間的天堂，令人起「此間樂，不思蜀」之遐想。尤其在夜間，高高的洋房裏，電燈雪亮，樂聲靡靡，一對對男男女女，相互摟抱着，多麽寫意，幾乎忘了炎熱的夏天。假如你趁着夜間無事，到南市斜橋去巡邏一趟，那或許要疑心走進了地獄門，完全和理想中的樂土，截然相反。因爲此地居民，大都在中資以下，一樓一底的一所屋子，要住上六七人家。前後樓和亭子間，不消說住滿了人··還有竈披間，客堂背後，擱樓裏也都住滿了。所以一所屋子裏，總得走出二十來個人。試想··鴿籠式的屋中，旣容納如許人物，在此熱得耐不過來的時候，還如何能睡得下？因此聰明的他和伊，挾了破蓆子，不得不向水門汀上舖起臨時的露天舖位來。這露天舖位，旣無蒸籠裏那麽熱的熱氣，又沒有臭蟲蚊子來擾人淸夢，樂得適適意意。於是一個人起了例，大家都跟上來，每至傍晚，水門汀上即已聚集了一大堆人。雖然還未到睡眠的時候，可是老早來預定了，怕被捷足者先登！有時竟因定舖較遲，嘰嘰咕咕吵嘴舌的也很多。此　完全是苦力，夏天貪凉，到得秋天總結賬起來，也只有苦力的人居多。某醫生說··「我們的生意經，也惟有秋天最好」。「上海原是樂土」這句話，從這裏看，便有幾分不確實··可是還有不少的人，拼命要跑到上海來。暑天之午後  胡小米　　天氣分外的炎熱了，赤了膊儘量的揮動着芭蕉扇，黄荳似的汗珠，依舊不住的冒出來。　　午後一切都靜靜的，沈悶的天氣，催着人打瞌睡。　　天是碧油油地好像大海，遠遠地高高地好像望不到邊際。沒有絲毫的風，樹枝都安閒的直力着一動也不動。太陽似猛火般的炙人。雖然是在二三丈路以外，也覺得勃勃的有熱氣。　　庭前的梧桐，長得高高地密密地，遮了陽光，愈顯得幽蒨可愛。樹蔭下躺了一頭老黄狗，伸長了舌頭張大了口吁吁地喘氣。　　樹蔭外面陽光中散佈着的幾塊西瓜皮上，聚滿了許許多多蒼蠅，一會兒嗡嗡地飛起，一會兒又嗡嗡地停下，似乎是愛戀了一樣美味可口的東西，要想捨去而又不忍捨去的樣子。　　牆外傳來「酸梅湯」的呌賣聲，在幽長的聲浪中，間着幾聲賣糖果的小鑼。　　此外，一切都是靜寂。小食譜玉蜀黍  憶秋　　「玉蜀黍，」滬地俗稱「珍珠米，」蘇虞一帶稱「御米，」北方則稱「玉米」或「包榖，」爲一年生植物，暮春開花，夏季結實，實有黄白紅等色，質有粳性糯性兩種，味甘而香，以吾蘇產者爲上品；近日市上已有發現，惟大都均視爲一種閒食，據我所知，可以製菜餚，可以製點心，均别具風味。茲當「玉蜀黍」上市，亟寫製法如左，以告未知者。　　製菜餚　　玉蜀黍製菜，我已嘗試者有兩種··（一）取新鮮之玉蜀黍若干，（以粳性爲佳）將乳粒削下，用「京冬菜」（南貨舖有售）、生炒，味殊鮮美；炒法極簡，先將削下之乳粒，傾入沸滾之油鍋，約炒半分鐘，加醬油鹽糖各少許，再將京冬菜放入，加水一小杯，總計入鍋時間三分鐘已足，惟應注意點有二，一，須用烈火炒·二，所用玉蜀黍須揀糯嫩而新鮮者。（二）整鷄一只去腹中五臟，擇糯性而新鮮之玉蜀黍乳粒半斤，徐徐裝入，加食鹽一錢，輕輕搗和，用海帶菜（南貨舖售）將鷄身緊縛，置適當之滾水中，入紹酒一匙，以烈火煮之，約煮一小時，再加少許食鹽於湯中，將鍋口用濕紙緊封，改用炭結，微火煨燉，約三四小時後，卽成，鷄肉湯汁，玉蜀黍，均各具特殊風味，此法平津一帶菜館有之，名爲「玉米鷄。」　　製點心　　凡北方人均嗜食之「窩窩頭，」卽玉蜀黍所製；惟南方人大都不合口胃，以其製法不良也。家母生長北平，善於吃的藝術，旅蘇以後常製「窩窩頭」餽贈蘇藉親友，頗獲贊美，因製法已加改革，頗合南方人之味覺，製法··預先準備材料··曬乾玉蜀黍粒，（雜糧號有售購回磨成細粉）紅糖，松仁，生猪油（切成丁予如骰子大小）冷開水，假令用玉蜀黍粉爲三升，則加一升冷開水，半斤紅糖，充分攪和，用手頻揉，（乾濕使與生餛飩皮同，）加再猪油丁，松仁，各一二百粒，（多少不拘）摔匀，揑成山東饅頭狀，下挖一凹孔，狀如石臼然，置蒸籠蒸之，約一小時卽成，味殊可口，好甜食者必尤嗜之。酸梅湯  尤其　　在繁榮的夏的都會裏，那些鮮橘水冰忌濂冰汽水等就成了應時必須的妙品，或者也可以說補劑，而其中尤以酸梅湯爲最普遍。大槪是希圖競爭（或者是表白正宗）的緣故吧？凡是酸梅湯的販賣者，必須的加上「北平」兩字，彷彿不如此就不能受人歡迎似的，於是，大者如鄭福齋，小者像ＸＸ記或ＸＸ齋等散見在都會的各部，以安慰那一部分奔走而渴熱的人提起酸梅湯，連帶的想到一件事，那是幼小的時候，非常的歡喜聽旁人講故事，尤其是關於古時打仗的這類，於是，在某一個機會裏，聽到三國時曹操用兵的一段，當然我是不禁的神往了。他（講者）說，某一次曹操出兵戰劉備，途中，無水可供汲飲，兵士渴甚，大譁，將領亦感同樣痛苦，頗覺難以應付，乃回禀曹操，述明原委，　曹隨策馬向前，高聲喝曰，汝等渴乎，可速疾行，前面有梅林甚多，足以解渴，將士聞之，口水滴垂，遂覺不渴。這雖是一節故事，於此亦可想見「梅子」在當時是處於何等的地位，和古昔用兵隨機應變的巧妙了。現在「北平酸梅湯」又已全部的上市，　飲者又儘量作牛飲。還好，總算藉爲號召的北平仍安然的保存着，在這停戰已然實現的現在，不知關外是否仍能照從前般的享受着啜飲，而且那飲罷的餘味不知是甜的還是酸的？</p>

<p>自由談論「花瓶」  曹聚仁　　　謚女職員爲「花瓶，」當然是一位天才的創作。花瓶云者，只是擺着當樣兒，沒有實際用處，如女人的耳墜似的東西。咬文嚼字的說來，好像男職員個個都是棟樑之才，而有勇氣自已到社會上找飯吃的女子，却沒有一個不是擺着做裝飾的花瓶似的！　　民國初元，革命初成，一班老官僚摸着鬍子說：一「暴民終不足以言治：見上司不懂規矩，擬條陳不懂格式，臨小民沒有威嚴。」於是黎元洪要請饒漢祥做儷駢電文，屈映光要請劉子香寫勸進表，革命小夥子被鬍子老官僚所嘲笑了。民國九年，文學革命運動，把文言送入毛坑，一班有年紀的書啓師爺又摸着鬍子說道：「倒底不中用呀，「的了嗎呢」可以寫在公文裏嗎？美國留學生畢竟要讓我們三分，做公文總不能用白話呀！」於是白話小夥子又被鬍子師爺所嘲笑了。民國十五年，國民革命軍帶來了女權空氣，使女子在社會上可以找到正當的職業，這一來，嘲笑的口沫又落在她們的頭上了。大槪也是「見上司不懂規矩，擬條陳不懂格式，臨小民沒有威嚴」這些考語，女職員乃得「花瓶」的謚語了。　　假如我是女職員，對於這帶侮蔑性的「花瓶」謚語，該用足尖來答復的。不過女子在「爭取經濟權卽是爭取人格」的時期，决不能取退讓態度，應當倒在侮蔑溝中，塡沒了牠，讓後來的女性可以平安通過。德國哈耳波倫博士在異性論第三章論「女子的社會的位置之發達」，說：「在許多許多年的黑暗之後，到了希臘的雅典時代，纔發現了一點光明，這乃是希臘名妓的興起。因了她們的精鍊優雅的舉止，她們的顏色與媚姿，她們不但超越普通的那些外宅，而且還壓倒希臘的主婦，所以在短時期中使她們在公私生活上佔有極大的勢力。這樣，歐洲婦女之精神的與藝術的敎育因賣淫制度而始建立。赫泰拉的地位可以算是所謂婦女運動的起始。」（周作人先生譯文）從這一意義看來，「花瓶」在中國女子經濟獨立史上自有其不可輕蔑的地位！　　可是我也並非是花瓶樂觀論者，當男職員評頭品足之際，女職員趕忙解開手箱拚命照鏡，撲粉，抹臙脂，卽不禁爲之打一寒噤，蓋花瓶終是磁製的，一旦被摔，雖請敎江西老表亦沒有辦法也。關於小學國語敎科書  吳鼎第　　最近幾天在自由談上看，到珠，無咎葉聖陶諸位先生關於敎科書的文章，也有少許的意見，想寫出來，以供留心的人士參考。現在市塲上行銷的敎科書，是否商品，我們不得不加以注意。因爲競銷的原故，把賣價喊低，這其中未嘗沒有他們的苦衷，只要那些商品是有價値的，是足供學生求知的需要的，卽使是「商品」，未必就是」樣壞的東西；我們固無須拘迂地稱之爲「智識的糧食」。　　關於敎科書的取材和範圍，葉聖陶先生主張各體俱備，我以爲這却有討論的必要。以目前的小學生國文程度而論，表達的能力實在算不得强，誠如珠先生所說，他們只會寫寫故事體的作品。推源其故，皆由於小學國語敎科書太偏重故事體的緣故。然而，各體俱備便行嗎？　　我記得陳柱尊先生曾爲中學國文敎科書標準問題寫過一封信給朱家驊先生，發表他的意見。他對於取材過泛，頗表不滿。雖則小學敎科書的取材較中學爲狹，根本文言的詩，詞，和文都沒有的，但是，體裁仍以不用過分擴充爲宜。　　也許有人駁我：陳先生說不宜取材過泛，和葉先生主張的體裁的擴充未必相同。不過，我們要曉得敎科書的最大目的，不外鍛鍊表達力和欣賞力而已。葉先生編國語敎科書的目的，大約也不能離開道兩點吧。小學生的欣賞力或許有些，然而表逹力恐怕還很缺乏，所以我們編敎科書的最好捉住這一個焦點，然後再加以革新的研究。我們先應該注意目前小學生的國語的程度如何，然後再去决定體裁應當如何伸縮。　　其實，大部分小學生的國語的程度并不算高，能做到充分表達的一步已經不是容易的事，假使我們再擴充國語敎科書的體裁，而他們不能認淸，不能選擇，那末，他們倒反而「莫衷一是」，眞如劉姥姥游大觀園了。最好我們尋出一條比較可靠的方法，能使小學生的表達力增加。我固然不贊成太偏重故事體，但我同時也不贊成擴充體裁的主張。總之，連中學的國語文尚且不應「兼收博采」，而以能運用文字表達思想和情感爲要素，則小學敎科書自更應避免錯雜，探討一種或數種的體裁以爲表達能力的基礎。蒭蕘之見，不知葉先生以爲如何？夏夜的魔羣  馬國亮　　已經是第三夜了。我們依舊不能安睡。半夜裏一次，兩次，而至於三四五次地把電燈開亮起來，爬起身翻着枕和褥。在那裏爬行着的是這麽小的動物，那便是使我們每每得從矇朧中跳起來的臭蟲，那夏夜底惡魔。「呀！」我們互相遙應者憤怒和驚嘆的聲音，我們底指頭毫無憐惜地把這小動物揑爛，血污斑染在枕上，床上。「又是一隻，該殺的！」淸喃喃地詛咒着，「該殺的！我們已經三夜不能安睡了。」「還有什麽辦法呢，我們什麽都做過了！」我又抓到了一隻，投在痰盂裏。　　眞的。我們什麽方法都用過了。起先，我們翻床掀褥地大大捕捉一回，還把殺蟲粉撒滿了褥子，到今天早上，我們還索性下狠毒的心，把床週圍都用火焚燒過丨幾乎可以說每一根鐵絲都燒過。滿以爲今夜總可安睡了。但是却不，我們依舊得從半夜的朦朧中跳起來！眞的，還有什麽方法呢？我們什麽方法都用過了。大槪過了半個鐘頭光景，覺得已經把那些小妖全部肅淸了。熄了電燈，我們又疲倦地倒在床上。　　朦朧地，朦朧地，有點飄飄然的感覺的時候，忽然有一個人在我身後拿了針狠命地刺入我的頸上，我痛極就跳了起來，我醒了！頸依然還刺痛着，經騐立刻告訴我這又是臭蟲。我馬上伸手到後面一抺，一股難以言喻的氣息衝到鼻孔來。　　睜開眼定了定神，我方發覺電燈早在不知什麽時候已亮起來。而隔床的淸也已跪在床上繼續在幹着剿滅的工作了。「瞧！這永遠捉不完的臭蟲！」淸看見我醒了，拿着一隻像綠豆般大的臭蟲給我看，帶點憤懣的聲音，「明天我們非大大再澈底淸除一回不可。已經幾夜不能安睡了，那還成什麽世界！」　　我笑笑，從床上爬起來。淸那種不高興的神情使我覺得很滑稽。我不禁說：「這也是一種有生命的動物呀！我們沒有權利去詛咒一種動物因爲牠尋找營養牠自已的食糧。餓了要吃，那一條生命不該存在的·淸，你身上的血正多着，讓牠們吃一點點又何妨呢！」「那末你···」　　「不！我以爲我們最好能預備一盆猪血給牠們。」　　「那不得了」，淸大呌起來，「我們得爲臭蟲花錢去買一盆猪血」！於是我們都大笑起來。　但是我得老實說，那些可憐牠們底話，不過說說罷了，對牠們，我仍舊是痛恨的。所以我和淸一樣，並沒有停止我這肅淸羣妖的工作。一直弄到以爲捉完了，才再躺在床上。　　那麽提心吊膽地，好容易到快要入睡的時候，脚背猛地裏又刺痛起來！　　霍地跳起來，天已大亮！低頭看看，一隻臭蟲正鼓盡了牠所有的力量，蠕蠕地向床沿爬去。我也懶得向牠動手了，完了一隻又來一隻，有什麽用呢，那永遠　一完的東西！　　我　了床，點了一根香烟坐在　前的椅上，我表示屈服了。再答余文剪公  趙景深　　二十四日你的答辯已看到，可是你對於我和落霞君所提出的下面的話不曾有什麽辯解：　　（一）你剪中國文學小史一○一面，上册只有幾頁是你自已寫的，中册全部是剪的，共剪了六部書，中册沒有你自已寫的斷片。例如，你把「歐洲近代文藝思潮論」第四章整整六十四面剪下來貼在你的「世界文學史」第九章上。　　（二）你剪書有時偶爾改幾個字，通常以隻字不改爲原則，好像是一個模子裏倒出來的。　　（三）你剪書時所改的字每每弄錯，汚蔑了原作者。例如改鄭氏和我的四處錯誤。（已見前文）　　你引我的話，何不引用原文「確有幾頁是你寫的，」而要硬做面子，含糊其辭說是「寫的有」呢？這樣就可以把你剪竊的行爲賴掉了麽？你說我是「造謠，」「誣衊，」可惜讀者是能夠翻檢你的大「剪」來和别人的書對照的。贓證具在，恐怕你無論怎樣賴也是賴不掉的。　　其餘都是枝節的問題，我不屑再和你辯論，免得你藉此轉移論點，混亂視線。我祗問你有沒有剪竊（你能夠把我和落霞君給你開的淸單推翻嗎？）？是不是竊賊？你敢乾脆回說「沒有」和　「不是」嗎？　　編者按：余慕陶君之「世界文學史」是否全係剪竊他人之著作一問題，往復辯論，已歷多時，余君對於「剪竊」一層，始終不肯提出比較有力之反證，實爲憾事。本刋爲此一問題所耗篇幅已多，現擬就此結束，以後雙方來文，槪不登載。平凡的事（二二）  澹果孫　　從門外看去，這個人家至多不過像上只有一個可容八口之家的地盤：可是進了門才明白牠的内容並不止如此，遠不止如此。原來那張大門是從一間屋子裏開出來的。這屋子很寛而不很深，本是這個人家正面五間頭的三間沒有隔斷的回面；這個正回兩面把其間的空地夾成一條長而狹的天井，再加上左右兩廂的披厦，於是乎就形成了一個矩形的匾口字了。之光跨進了門，就看見有十來個木工那屋子裏面做事，正面的客堂裡面，也有六七個木工。他們看見有人進來，就都抬頭一望，於是之光就認出了好幾副很熟的面孔。　　在寒暄，詢問和視察之後，之光已經明白了他們工作的實在情形。有些是做地洞裏面的支架的，有些是做小浜上面的跳板的，有些是做大浜上面的便橋的，這都是軍事工程的木工重要部分。單就「做」的方面而論，當然是處於比較安全的地方，可是他們的職務不僅是「做」，有時候還得跟着做好的材料跑到前線去「安」，這樣就眞是非有一副飽受熱血滋養的頭腦不可了。因此這好漢子經過十來天的工作，就頗有一些或傷或死的人：然而那些活着而健全的，却仍然不更變固有的義勇志願。　　這樣抱着義勇志願跑到閘北軍旗下面服務的木工，這時也有千人光景，他們一樣受着軍法的部勒，分成了若干組，每組由一個工兵少尉指揮。在必要時和泥工通力合作。這些在陳家浜一村做事的數目，約莫有七八十人，他們並不是一個甚麽廠裏來的，更不是從一個甚麽帮裏來的，分配的地點，完全是根據歸組的先後而定：這樣抱着一個共同目標服務成千累百的好漢子，儘管有時候語言竟不能暢通，然而他們在作上却毫沒有甚麽隔閡。這時候，之光對於他們得着深刻的認識了，尤其是視察了全村一遍之後，和同來的幾個代表以及多數的工人一塊兒吃着午飯當兒的那一段對話。這頓午飯是在張擱在許多工具之間的長板桌上胡亂吃的，鹹魚，蔬菜，白煮大塊猪肉，粗劣的碗筷，許多人痛快地吃着談天，這一切，都可以呌之光迴想從前做工人時候的星期日的特别午餐。「你們也做夜班嗎？」之光問。　　「可以說是不做，因爲這裏沒有電燈。」某一個工友說。　　「有時候」，邱代表說，「這裏也有過一兩盞汽油燈，但是不大方便，也不實惠，所以沒有常用。」　　「那末，夜裏休息的時候就多了！」　　「好裏，張先生！」那個工人說，「夜裏要是有事，就是要趕到外面去的！」　　「：：：有時還要趕到火線邊去的！還要趕到火線上邊去的！」許多人搶着說。　　　「單是說去，那還不過多跑幾里路，」某一個工人說，「頂費事的，就是我們去的時候，還要抬着木頭走好些路。黑黑夜裏抬着木頭走，若是路長，可眞躭誤時候。」　　「時候固然躭誤了！」另一個工人說，「抬的人氣力也用完了，這樣，一件算好的工作，總難得照期安好裝好！」　　「你們遠的地方，」之光問，「要走到那裏？」　　「頂遠，我們到過楊行鎭，」許多工人說。　　「那末，就是三四十里路了！」之光說，「你們常去嗎？」　　「来常去，」某一個工人說，「我們常去而又最遠的地方，就是由大塲再包到江灣的西邊，那也就殼二十多里了！」</p>

<p>談言發財的機會  小之　　一談起、「發財」，差不多是沒有一個人不笑逐顏開而在熱烈盼望期待着的·眞的，「發財」眞是夠人喜歡的事！因爲，聽說；發了財不但洋房汽車，嬌妻艶妆，物質上可以盡量的享愛，而且當今第一流的大人物大先生也愛和他來往做朋友，這該是一件何等光宗耀祖并且留名百世的美事啊？！　　但是，眞夠掃興的·這年頭兒，這奇怪的社會裏，畢竟窮人太多了丨丨他們在生活的鐵鞭下掙扎哀號，在磨榨的剥取中痛苦呻吟，脂膏汗血差不多都乾凈了，從那裏去談「發財」呢？······　　不過，在咱們的上海就好得多了，雖說咱們也是熱烈地盼望期待「發財」而實際上一樣仍然在呻吟掙扎的勞働者，可是「發財」的希望和機會就多得多了！例如：說小些，打花會，跑狗，回力球，輪盤賭等等都是能夠呌人笑孜孜滿可以希望「發財」的事；還有買一包香烟或是一塊肥皂，便有發一千塊大洋財的希望！一千塊錢，固能在「財人」眼裏算不得甚麽財，但在窮人看起來倒是夠快樂下半世的幸福事，何况所化代價至多不過「一天的工資」，就是餓上一天的肚皮，而竟換得「下半世的安樂」！所以大家都這樣說；「這是多値得的事」！　　至於拼着餓拿一個月的工錢去買一張跑馬票而便中了三十萬或四十萬的頭奬，那更是要快活得手舞足蹈的！因爲這樣才算眞正合了「發財」的希望，値得大書特書。　　這些都不是虚的，確乎在咱們的上海曾有千百萬人吃飯睡覺甚至於大便洗澡時都是這樣在熱烈地期待，在熱烈地追求；而事實上，亦果然有在這種種的形式下產生出來的暴富翁！　　咱們大中華民國「致富唯一之機會」的航空公路建設奬券，聽說眼前就要開奬了。這兩天，財迷們眞要喜歡得若痴若醉！横在心頭的是「菩薩保佑」「天睜眼睛」「假如我中頭奬，必定燒香還願」，有的竟把得奬後的用途都劃好了預算决算表！這未太「急財兒」了些，怪可憐的；但仔細想想，這也是應該，因爲（跑馬是洋人主辦，那是利權外溢，不愛國！），何况這目的又是建設航空和公路呢？將來建設成功，咱們不但便有飛機可以去報仇打東洋人不成問題，並且還有很平滑堅實優美的公路供咱們兜風，發財而又救國，名正文順，名利雙收，劃算透了！　　最最後，謹以至恭敬至誠懇的態度和姿勢向我們的一星期後「五十萬」頭奬得主的「暴富翁」致五十萬分的賀意！并祝福他永遠康寗，因爲他是我們的「救國」的實行者！文藝摩登竹枝詞  孟樓　　年華嬌小學時髦。窄窄衣衫細細腰。講究新行曲線美。抹胸解放乳峯高。　　趨時新飾說摩登。窄袖旗袍拂脚根。骨格可憐輕似絮。路人疑是半開門。　　靑絲燙得亂蓬蓬。濃染胭脂兩頰紅。羡煞蠟黄金銷片。一生常得貼酥胸。談投考  巴玲　　在這個炎炎而悠長的「暑期」裏，各級學校的忙着招考，和各級學生的忙着投考，是一件很顯然的事。（有報紙爲證）而且，在這「暑期」裏，不僅學校的招考已也，還有各機關的招考職員或招考書記練習生等，很多的也利用這「暑期」來舉行的，唉！「暑」期大可稱之爲「考」期。　　因此，作者在這裏，很投機來談一下「投考」。　　「考」，原來是考。試。學力體力經騐的，所以任何機關招考，或任何學校招考，祗要自問有投考的資格，合乎他們招考的條件。而有志去應考的話，那末，不論男也女也，都有應考的資格，都有應考的機會，簡言之，都有報名的權利。　　作者，這幾句話，恐怕大家都能表示同情吧？　　可是，事實所揭示於我們的，却不是如此。　　在烏烟瘴氣的社會裏，所反映出來的，也是烏烟瘴氣的事實，投考，招考，當然地不能例外。　　你看，各學校的招考，不是規定需要文憑嗎？不是規完需要報名費，或試騐費嗎？文憑當然是代表學力的一個極有力的證據，可是，當某生在某一階級肄業完了，考試及格，學校頒發文憑後，再去投入高一階級的時候，照理同是公立學校的畢業生，（私立例外）同受公家的指導監督，可以免試升學的了，但是，在中國的社會，在現在的中國的社會，却不能，仍然要報名受試，這不是一件極端予盾的事嗎？　　其次，談到所謂報名費，原爲限制投考者而設，其實，投考是人民的一種普通的權利，繳報名費已是一件不通的事，我們現在姑退一萬步言，承認限制投考，恐怕投考者大多的話，是對的，那末，我們再追向，爲什麽大多數的學校，收了報名費，取否一律不發還呢？這種不發還的報名費，我們祗能認爲是報名稅，不是報名費、因是稅抽去了就算了，當然不會再發還給你的，所以，假如一個靑年學生，在暑期裏投考五個學校，如每校收報名費一元，則須犧牲五元，如果是每校收二元的話，就要犧牲十元，唉，靑年學生的受學校的壓迫，的剥削，亦大可憐矣。　　最後，再談到機關的招考，那簡直是一件發財的事了，友人某，曾反考ＸＸ機關，報名費繳去二元，投考者達九百餘人，而錄取却祗六七十名，而且據說，有三四十名已是内定的名額，如此，則在九百餘人中，祗取三四十名，眞是一件不容易的事，敞人錄取與否，姑置不論，但ＸＸ機關，此種投考，利用了失業人的心理，收到了大批的報名費，不是報名稅，是一件無可規定的事實，可謂名利兼收了可喜。可賀。</p>

<p>本埠增刊小玲  一蘋　　星期六，爸爸中餐前就回家了。媽媽到廚房中燒爸爸喜歡吃的炒蝦腰，爸爸躺在沙發上看報，小玲蹲在爸爸身旁吃牛糖。ＸＸＸ准於今夜登台，像梅蘭芳的霸王别姬一般大小的廣告被爸爸看到了，「ＸＸＸ走着紅運哩！」爸爸自語着。媽媽已把小菜燒好，安放在正中的台上，「爸爸吃飯」小玲第一個爬上櫈去喊了起來。爸爸吃着炒蝦腰，無意地說：「ＸＸＸ登台，Ｘ世界也登了很大的廣告。」　　「今夜看去。」媽媽笑着說了。　　「玲也要去。」小玲看着爸爸媽媽的臉。　　「乖些吃飯，爸同你去。」　　媽媽並不眞的要去看ＸＸＸ，爸爸也沒有承認一定帶小玲到Ｘ世界去。一個小家庭中，有這末一個討人喜歡的孩子，吃飯時說說這一類話是怪樂趣的，但是小玲却記着「爸同你去，」在小孩子的想像中Ｘ世界是個很好玩的地方。　　晚飯也吃過了，爸爸在天井中乘凉，媽媽在房中整理未了的事，一切像平時一樣，小玲坐在爸爸身旁又不敢開口，聽聽房中，媽媽也不像有出門的舉動。　　「爸爸，什麽時候了？」小孩子的聰明似的問了起來。　　「睡還早哩。」爸爸誤會了孩子的意思　　小玲失敗似的抓抓頭，見媽媽出來，跑近去低低地說：「媽，Ｘ世界去嗎？　　「媽媽說的，怪熱的天，　日帶你去吧，　媽拍着他的　。　　　　　　　　「那裏去？」爸爸問了。　　　　　　「Ｘ世界，玲記着到Ｘ世界去呢！」　　小玲望着爸爸的臉。爸爸坐起身來說：「我忘了，呌媽換件衣服帶你去。」出乎意外的允許，小玲跳了起來，撲到媽妈懐裏，「媽一同去？」　　「媽肚裏有弟弟，不去」爸爸的說话南聲了一點。　　小玲换了衣服，携着爸爸的手，到Ｘ世界去，眼前的一切，在小玲都覺得新奇，他同爸爸媽媽常去的，都在黑暗中看戲，而且不許開口，開了口就被爸爸說：「下次不帶你來了！」忽然小玲喊了起來：「爸爸這裏不是Ｘ世界，是大Ｘ（小玲沒有識過這個字）園，」爸爸莫名其妙地回顧來，望見「大觀園設在二層樓上」的幾個字。　　這個讀「官」字，是Ｘ世界的一部份，你要去看嗎？」　　「不，我要看ＸＸＸ。」小玲午飯時聽見爸爸說過個名字。　　爸爸携着手到二層樓上，迎面一塊大的廣告板，小玲一個一個字的讀了起來「航，妹，六，」爸爸笑了。　　塲裏已滿是人，旁邊也站滿了，賣兩角的特别座，掛起了客滿的牌子。小玲東張西望，儘是人家的腿，「爸，我瞧不見。」爸回答「我也瞧不見，」但終於把小玲抱了起來，小玲看見一隊穿黄衣的兵，「體操，航妹六沒有好看。」他從爸爸的身上跳了下來。　　「玲，到下面吃冰去，」爸也被人家擠得不舒服，拉了小玲往下跑，小玲聽見吃冰，自然也走得很快。　　回到家裏，媽媽問小玲瞧見什麽？小玲說，「航妺六有什麽好看，兵，體」操」。他舉起　　走了　步　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　的　　　　　　現代名人書畫之二十　　席與貞畫（略歷）　　席瑾華字與眞莫釐人席德樊之女公子專寫山水筆墨豪縱無　幃氣亦爲嵩山草堂入室弟子小說紅綠燈下（三十五）  禧林　　李博士毫不猶豫的答認了他。祗是另外有一個什麽問題在他屋邊徘徊，王化以爲他要提出條件，很機警的表示「但說無妨」的態度。李博士果然决心說通：　　「正好，你來，我就來介紹你認識吳子卿，趙一山他們，他們正在商量一件事！」一說着便走去推開了前一間客廳門，王化跟在後面，整一整衣冠。那些長衫客仍在商量自已的事，一點也沒有留意到他們，一直等他們走得很近的時候，其中一個才揚一揚手，停止大家說話。李博士於是一一給介紹道：「這位是吳子卿先生，這位是趙一山先生，這位是王惠正先生，這位是ＸＸＸ·······」轉向王化，而後··「這位就是ＸＸＸＸ團體聯合會的主要份子，密司特王化。」　　大家坐下來，王化先說明了要請他們號召捐欸的事由，李博士而後加以補充，並謂··　　密司特王作事很有經騐，很能幹！剛才我貫獻給各位的意見，現在可以由ＸＸＸＸ團體聯合會代辦一切了。」　　王化很明白代辦的會是些什麽事。便說：　　「我想大家總認識楊介夫先生罷，楊先生好像曾對我談過這一層。」　　吳子卿丨吳老頭兒捻鬍鬚，表示一種明達了悟的態度。趙一山也會意地回道：　　「介夫嗎？他那種做法我認爲有點不對的地方，事關同業名譽，怎可那樣一愼重？我們應該有一個根本的方策，固然，我們如果不和日人做生意，經濟自然難於流動，就是小商家也會沒有飯吃。」　　「愛國我們當然要愛國的！」李博士說話倒底不失敎授的身份，在這些大商家當中，他尤其不可疏忽他參謀的地位。我們不要忘記，李敎授是上海著名的市價經濟學者。他說：「但我們要從根本上愛起，瘦子逞英雄有什麽好處！愛國第一是在充實國力，人民窮了便等於國家瘦，譬如上海的印刷所，他們若不用日本紙，根本祗好關門大吉，人民的購買力這樣低弱，用高貴的紙印申出書來，幾塊錢一册，誰有錢來買？」　　李博士並不去想到日本紙的傾銷，國貨的中國紙業將怎麽樣呢？從這一點可以知道他實在是一個十足的買辦經濟學者，比一般喊振興工業，提倡國貨的學者，更能本質地履行他的職責。　　王化和他們談話的結果，吳，趙，王等全都答認加入ＸＸＸＸ團體聯合會，連楊介夫，李石喬及自已共成爲九個常務委員。第二天的報上免不了一則很　人的新茸，而且宣佈其重要　作計劃爲二爲抗日軍隊而募捐與嚴格檢查仇貨</p>

<p>電影專刊希特勒統治下的德國電影界（下）  黄君如　　「德國的覺醒」也爲國社黨黨製的宣傳片，曾在本年四月二十日希特勒總理的誕生日開映。此片還有一小題呌做「德國國民再生的記錄」，與「流血的德意志」同樣的包含一大堆的國社黨褐衫進行的演說。　　此外，民間的電影公司也紛紛迎合國社黨的意旨，大批製作法西斯化的影片。例如「萊茵悲愴曲」及其他一切新的愛國戰爭片。名導演塞列蒂曾與諾曼恊力發表了將製作國粹片「至上的德意志」的消息。此片預分二部，一爲「死的舞蹈」，爲「開拓道路」，把一九一八年起至一九三三年止，即國社黨獲得政權之前夜止的歷史事件爲劇材。高博爾已贊成此舉，且答應將極力援助。又最近在加比特爾戲院所演的「黑色突擊旗下」，係描寫東普魯士的農民，其攝製時一個職業演員也沒有使用，僅從農民中挑選脚色。以歐洲大戰後受資本主義侵襲瀕於疲弱饑餓的農村，而漸漸棄掉了中世紀以來的封建傳統，自覺起來站到法西斯旗下爲主題，結末一段還有國社黨魁首希特勒的演說，從此可見這是完全的國社黨宣傳的影片。　　希特勒政府對於電影檢閱是很嚴厲的。不僅禁止與國社黨主張不相容的影片不許開映，而且剥削猶太系電影業者的營業權，於是美國電影進口業就蒙了絶大的打擊。其被禁止開映的影片，大槪以美俄居第一，法英次之。意大利片則大受歡迎，這不外由於德意兩國之携手且兩國俱是法西斯化的緣故。　　上面所說，是希特勒鐵拳統治下德國電影界一般的狀勢，然將來的趨勢究將怎樣呢？倘若希特勒政府沒有倒臺，則德國電影全般必趨於法西斯化無疑。這從下面的事實便可知道。即綱羅德國電影藝術家全員的「德國電影藝術家保護恊會」，牠不僅合併於國社黨的文化政治機關，而爲國社黨文化運動的突擊隊，而且初受排斥猶太的張本人「德意志文化鬭爭聯盟」之統制，後則自動解散組織（五月八日）加入「德意志文化鬭爭聯盟」和「國黨經營細胞組織」了。從此已失去德國的電影藝術家，技術家獨自的立塲與組織，而化爲國社黨的一員了。故將來德國的電影界必然將塗上希特勒主義的色彩，而製作出來的影片也必然爲國社黨宣傳主義無疑。（完）觀衆意見談談「兩秒鐘」  迷糊　　歐美電影大槪總跳不出男女糾紛的故事，所以這張「兩秒鐘」裏羅曼斯題材，是用不着注意的。不過「兩秒鐘」的作·者似乎站在對於目前「美國式」的男女糾紛，抱着輕微的反感的立塲上，所以他接連的用着醉後强迫而成婚禮，以及輕率的毆打，輕率的悔過等幾件事，來表現出現代男女對於婚姻是何等的草率和不負責任。　　其次製作者是非常明徹的看到金錢勢力的偉大，所以他不但把雪蘭寫得雖嫁了約翰，而仍和舞塲經理湯納往來。他更寫出約翰病了之後，約翰的妻也向約翰最恨的人湯納借錢。雖在僥倖中奬淸償宿債以後，還是打死雪蘭而「法醫乃不容罪人之辯，逕依院長之命令執行死刑」這段對於現在法律實在給與不輕的諷刺。　　至於技術方面我先得介紹這張片子的倒叙法。死囚約翰在電椅上兩秒鐘之懺悔而全部故事就在約翰之回憶中展開。倒叙法，或則回憶法在電影中是數見不鮮的。不過以兩秒鐘的短時間，能不能回憶得這樣詳細，實在誰也不知道的了。　　編者按「兩秒鐘」一片，兩個多月前在國泰演過。這次在卡爾登是第二度重映，本無再加以評論之必要，不過迷糊君所提出幾點尚有見地，故特爲表而出之。至於兩秒鐘内迴憶這許多事，我想是不可能的。我想「陣心血來潮，難過一下」是最多的了。但是我不敢過於武斷，或者坐在電椅，思想轉得快些，亦未可知也。不敏一報還一報  西復　　約翰巴里穆亞是一位優伶世家出身的大明星。因爲他是一位大明星，所以他很自負。因爲他自負得很所以架子未免大些。有許多景仰明星的影迷們，喜歡請明星們簽字，好像我們貴國人看見了大人先生們，就要請求墨寳似的。但是他們遇見了約翰巴里穆亞，就被他拒絶了。所以有許多人因爲巴里穆亞架子很大，大家就不敢冒昧起來。但是不久之前，好萊塢來了一位大思想家，大戲劇家，大文豪，也是大野人頭。他非别人，就是那鼎鼎大名的蕭伯納。這一下子，可她了。約翰巴里穆亞特設宴爲蕭伯納洗塵。這兩位戲劇界和電影界的大頭腦，雖則賓主之間，歡洽無間。可是英雄相會，未免心中存了試探　法之意。約翰巴里穆亞首先拿了一本書，他對蕭老頭兒道；「這是我兒子的書，請你在上面簽一個字，以遂孺子之願。」蕭老頭兒笑容滿面地拍拍巴里穆亞的肩膀說道；「要是這本書是你祖父的，我就替他簽字了。」這消息傳了出去，一般素來覺得約翰巴里穆亞架子大的人，都鼓掌稱快，　蕭老頭兒替他們報了仇了。明星們消遣法一種  馥　　有人用得有人用不得　　格羅利亞史璜遜女士，新近發明了一個消遣法。她沒有事的時候，就拿起電話筒來打電話玩。她打電話是沒有目的的。她在電話簿上，隨便檢了一個號碼就打。她的用意係告訴那接電話的人，她是格羅利亞史璜遜，而聽那對方的驚奇聲丨「哦！」於是她就隨便談了一回，銷磨銷磨光陰，人家接電話的，亦都很喜歡，並且有許多人盼望一天能有這個幸運，接到史璜遜的電話。　　後來這個消遣法，被小范朋克聽見了，他亦仿造起來。他一天沒有事做，亦就在寢室裏打起電話來。那面接電話的係一個小女孩。小范朋克想，好極了，和一個小孩子談談亦不錯。他於是告訴了她，說他是小范朋克。他等了一回，那面沒有回音。他又說了聲「我是小范朋克，你聽見了沒有？」從此之後，小范朋克再也不敢打電話玩了。許多明星去歐洲  福　　蓓蓓旦妮兒已經到歐洲去了，。她想在英國倫敦拍一張片子。和她同去的，還有一位莎麗愛鸞，她去的時候，並沒有目的，不過是陪蓓蓓旦妮兒玩玩的。後來她們到了英國之後，英國高蒙公司亦將莎麗愛鸞聘了去，所以現在莎麗亦在英國拍片子了。裴斯開登不久之前，亦乘輪歐洲去了。他不久亦將在英國拍片子，他的夫人不久亦將赴英。現在好萊塢又傳說著茂立斯希佛萊不久亦要到歐洲去了。他想在派拉蒙公司合同期滿後，即乘輪返法。他在法國想自已拍攝一張歌舞片。嘉寳老脾氣沒有改  覆　　人家說葛雷泰嘉寳這回從歐洲回到好萊塢，脾氣已經改變了，不似從前那樣古怪了。但是差了，她的脾氣竟一些沒有改過。她第一天到美國的時候，她亦會說，亦會笑，她亦站立着讓新聞記者拍照，她亦說了幾句話，應酬應酬那一般圍集在碼頭上的新聞記者。但是自從她上了汽車，回到好萊塢之後，她就恢復了老脾氣。她現在除工作之外，不延見新聞記者，不讓人家拍照，和從前一樣的古怪，他現在要求公司裏，呌羅諾德柯爾曼回來，和她作配角，但是柯爾曼現在在歐洲，一時恐怕不能回來也。好萊塢之黑暗世界  炳　　好萊塢現在流行一種浴室，許多明星家中都羣相倣造。這種浴式的内部完全黑色。牆壁用黑色的雲母石，浴盆用黑色的磁盆，椅子也用黑色，地板也是黑色，洗臉盆更是黑色，甚之肥皂出用黑色，手巾也用黑色，即如浴衣也要穿黑色的。總之，無一不黑，有許多明星特地雇用了黑種人穿了黑衣黑鞋黑襪專門管理這一間黑色的浴室。　　葛萊泰喜寳在歐洲的時候，聽到好萊塢發現黑暗世界很覺得有趣。她向她的朋友說：「一切都是黑的浴室，但是最好水也是黑的，那麽，從黑暗浴定中用黑水洗了浴出來大家都可以變成黑人了。」以肉體豐肥風尚一時的梅威斯脫女士近影倫敦銀海星光  羅芬　　繼千面人郎却奈而起，顧爲藝術而犧牲的保里斯卡洛夫，自從演了一部「科學怪人」之後，譽聲鵲起。最近保里斯演人一部「古國艶乘」之後，深得英國影界之贊尚，遂由高蒙公司延聘了去。　　却爾斯賴甫登自從演過了派拉蒙公司的「羅宮春色」之後，因爲他沒有條件的牽制，所以立刻起程到歐洲去了。現在他在倫敦，穿了亨利八世皇帝在一千五百七十年時代的服裝。每天到漢伯登皇宮中去玩耍。他原是英國皇族的後裔，所以能出入皇宮之中。現在他在倫敦，或者要進高蒙公司，高蒙公司已派人同他接洽。　　米高梅公司的老閭賽茂爾高温氏夫婦，現在已經到了倫敦，賽茂爾高温氏現在是世界第一影業巨頭。英國電影界亦很景仰高爾温氏的改良影業的手段。這一次賽茂爾温和他夫人到了倫敦。倫敦的電影界爲他二人開了一個盛大的歡迎會，倫敦人民參加歡迎者甚衆，頗極一時之盛。歐美攝影塲巡禮（六）  雲巖　　環球城的僱員工人，通常爲一千人，裡面有動物園一所，獅象虎豹，一應俱全·還有一個雞塲，蓄雞約數千頭·裡面有馬廐，養着很多的馬·在西方影片（卽武俠片）盛行的時候，塲内還雜居着不少的牧童·裡面還有一座雇員的娛樂廳，設備很好·一處大餐館，就是外面的人，也可以到裏面進食的。　　在一九一五年以前，環球公司，是在一處很小的攝影塲裡拍戲·這個攝影塲，在高厄和貝莉華西口的中間，現在是早被焚燬了·那時卡爾雷門，看准影戲事業將來一定發達，就開始建築今日的大攝影塲。落成之後，竟有四萬五千餘人，坐了專事去看這奇怪的地方·連得愛迪生和亨利福特，也曾駕了汽車，到那裡去參觀·　　環球攝影塲，在無聲影片時代，勢力當然非常雄厚·一班出道最早的大明星像梅茂萊，郎却乃等，都是在環球裡出名的·自從有聲影片盛行後，它也就突飛猛晋，衝入新的陣線裏去·　凡塲裏的一切設備和機件，也都換了最新式的了。　　（人）皮康斯塲（英國）Ｂｅｃｏｎｓｆｉｅｌｄ　　丨英國獅子影片公司影塲在英國巴京汗郡丨　　皮康斯塲這地方，是屬於巴京汗郡管轄的，它本是一個完全英國式的鄉鎭·鎭上照例有很闊的十字街·街頭的房屋，到了日中的時候，還是死氣沉沉的她像在那裏睡覺·自從英國獅子影片公司成立後，才使得這鎭市漸漸活潑起來·到了現在，皮康斯塲地母親，也會把着她們的嬰孩，到攝影塲裏去充任臨時演員了·皮康斯塲的孩子們，也會去看看那些電影明星怎樣工作了·　　這座攝影塲，隱伏在一個極高屋頂的下面·它的底層，地位很大，在這座大房子的邊上，有一排平房是泥水匠和木匠等的工塲，那一邊，是影片放映室，辦公室和一排儲藏影片的塲所，整個的影塲，坐落在一塊很大的草地上，四面圍着很高的圍牆·（未完）</p>

<p>Li Jichun Discusses Matters for Three Hours at the Two Commissioners' Residence</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Sets Off This Morning with the Four County Magistrates of Northern Ping</p>
<p>Song Naigan Fails to Take Over the Tangshan Public Security Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tangshan) The Tangshan Municipal Public Security Bureau has decided to implement the takeover on the 25th, with no further delays. This afternoon, Li Jichun went to the Qixin Company to discuss matters with the two Commissioners, Xue and Lei, for three hours before leaving. In the evening, a banquet was held for Song Naigan and Gao Xixian, the new and old Bureau Chiefs, to introduce them to each other. The outcome was harmonious, and a smooth exchange is expected. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) According to the two Commissioners, Xue and Lei, speaking to reporters, the takeover can begin as soon as the county magistrates arrive in Tangshan, with no other issues. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After arriving in Tangshan, Song Naigan has met with Li Jichun to negotiate the takeover procedures thoroughly. It is expected that the takeover can be completed today or tomorrow. The county magistrates of Luan Dong and Luan Xi counties can gather in Tangshan today. The takeover will begin from tomorrow onwards. The special police officers preparing to be brought must have their handover procedures thoroughly negotiated before proceeding to avoid misunderstandings. Tao Shangming previously agreed with Yuan Liang to select one hundred police officers from Ping to form a special police force. He will lead them to the northern route tomorrow morning to negotiate the takeover. If there are no obstacles, Miyun and Wanping will be taken over around the 26th, Jixian will be taken over on the 27th, and it is scheduled to be completed by the 28th. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Naigan arrived in Tangshan yesterday and contacted Li Jichun, intending to take over the Public Security Bureau according to the original agreed plan. Li Jichun stated that the original police and garrison forces in Tangshan could not be withdrawn temporarily and would be withdrawn on the 24th to be replaced by the police led by Song. From this morning until noon, Li had not sent anyone to notify. As of this time, the Tangshan Public Security Bureau has not yet been taken over. Xue Zhiheng, our resident commissioner in Tangshan, inquired with Li, who stated that he would hand it over as soon as the procedures were completed. Today, the citizens of Tangshan gathered near the Public Security Bureau, wanting to witness the appearance of the Blue Sky White Sun flag, but they were disappointed again. It is currently rumored in Tangshan that agents of the puppet government have arrived in Tangshan to obstruct the takeover, attempting to delay it with excuses. Whether there will be a postponement will be reported later tonight. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming is scheduled to lead the four county magistrates of northern Ping tomorrow morning to first contact the Japanese army in Miyun, and then separately go to Huairou, Zunhua, Miyun, and Jixian counties to take over. He will also travel with one hundred Beiping security police officers. Tao stated that the takeover affairs of the four counties in northern Ping have been coordinated with the Japanese military and can proceed smoothly. Shi Yousan's troops have withdrawn from the railway line and have been transferred to Yutian for concentration. When traveling near Yutian, there was a misunderstanding with the local militia, which was quickly resolved. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet troops along the Lutai-Ludong railway line were completely withdrawn yesterday and concentrated in Tangshan to await reorganization. The puppet troops in Ninghe are also gradually decreasing and will be completely withdrawn soon. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The education associations of various counties in the war zone have submitted a request to the military sub-committee, requesting that the various troops return the military advances, vehicles, and livestock. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Bank of China remitted 200,000 yuan to Tangshan on the 24th, which is for the Li unit's post-war expenses. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Tangshan Special Public Security Bureau was originally scheduled to be taken over yesterday, but due to incomplete procedures, it has been changed to today. The Japanese and puppet troops from the three counties of Linyu, Luanxian, and others will withdraw successively tomorrow and will be taken over. Li Zeyi will lead the remaining ten county magistrates and 500 Tianjin security police officers directly to the various counties to take over, without concentrating in Tangshan. All funds have been handed over to Li Jichun for distribution. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Zeyi returned to Ping from Tangshan this afternoon with Japanese military officer Shibayama. According to reports, the handover of war zone affairs is proceeding smoothly and no complications have occurred. The puppet troops will be concentrated in Tangshan from today to be counted and await being incorporated. He came to report everything to He and Huang. He also visited Yu Xuezhong in Tianjin. Because everything was in order, Colonel Shibayama also had no need to stay in Tangshan and returned to Ping on the same train. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The progress of taking over the Ludong war zone is quite slow. Yesterday afternoon, a new Chinese county magistrate arrived in Tangshan and discussed matters with Li Jichun. As a result, it was decided to take over the public security bureau and county government this morning, and it was decided to take over Ninghe, Yutian, Fengrun, Luzhou, Laoting, Qian'an, Lulong, Funing, and Changli tomorrow. The Beining Railway Bureau has been ordered to prepare trains to transport the dismissed subordinates of Li Jichun. Currently, the takeover of Miyun and other places must be delayed slightly. Today, the county magistrates of Miyun, Jixian, Zunhua, Huairou, and other places north of Beiping have arrived here one after another. They will go to Miyun to take over on Tuesday. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Many Hardships Endured Along the Way</p>
<p>Will Fly to Jinan Tomorrow to Visit Family</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Tonggang, an overseas Chinese aviator who studied in Germany, flew his self-funded plane from Germany on the 26th of last month, passing through Austria's Ber, Grlitz, Yugoslavia, Turkey's , Afghanistan, Persia, India's , and Myanmar and Siam's Menggu. He arrived in Annam this month on the 20th, flew to Guangzhou the next day, arrived in Changsha on the 23rd, and flew to Beijing from Changsha today, landing at Ming Palace Airfield at 2:30 PM. At 8 PM, the Beijing press corps hosted a dinner at the Central Hotel to welcome Sun. Sun's father is in Jinan, and he plans to fly to Jinan on the 25th to visit him. According to reports, apart from Chen Wenlin, he is the second Chinese person to fly solo for a long distance. It took a total of 28 days from Germany to Beijing, with only 19 days of flying and 10 days and five hours of stopping. There were a total of fifteen stops. The report stated that he originally intended to donate this plane to the National Government, but after reconsidering that the plane can only carry one person and might not be suitable for the talents in the country and would be ineffective, and that he might still take this plane back to Germany to study aircraft engineering for further development, he was unable to donate the plane at this time. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Tonggang, a young Chinese aviator who studied in Germany, took off from Futh, Germany on June 26th in his self-prepared single-seat Klem aircraft to return to China, crossing Europe and Asia, passing through more than a dozen countries. He arrived in Guangzhou on July 20th after many hardships along the way. He arrived in Changsha on the 23rd and flew to Beijing on the afternoon of the 24th, landing at Ming Palace Airfield. Sun is the first person to fly solo from Europe back to China. He encountered danger many times along the way and almost died. Fortunately, Sun was able to repair the aircraft himself and completed his journey according to the original plan. At a time when the country is in urgent need, Sun has brought glory to the country by advocating for aviation to save the country and is truly admirable. When Sun arrived in Beijing, he circled the sky three times before landing on the ground. Many agencies and organizations did not arrive at the airport to welcome him because they did not know that Mr. Sun was flying so fast. Only a small number of agency representatives, organizations, the press, and others were waiting at the airport. After Sun got off the plane, he shook hands with the welcomers and was led to the stationmaster's office by Director Du to rest. Then, a cadre from the Lizi Society welcomed him to stay at the society. Sun is healthy and energetic and tirelessly talked about his flight. According to reports, it took 28 days from taking off from Fürth, Germany on June 26th to arriving in Beijing on the 24th, with 16 days of flying, a total of 130 hours, and a distance of more than 20,000 miles. He passed through more than a dozen countries, including Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, Arabia, Persia, India, Burma, Siam, and Annam to reach Guangzhou. He encountered difficulties when passing through deserts and wetlands. When passing through Arabia, he encountered a very high tornado and was forced to land in the desert three times. He got lost midway, the plane was burned, and he flew the damaged plane to Baghdad in Arabia. It could not be repaired there, so he flew more than a thousand miles to Basrah, where he was able to repair it. The local British garrison was deeply impressed by the spirit of the Chinese people and gave him preferential treatment. Later, on the way from Persia to India, when passing through a high mountain 100 miles from Calcutta, he encountered a rainstorm, and the plane's engine stopped due to the rain. He landed on a small mountain to repair it himself. That night, he risked arriving in Calcutta, where the Chinese Consul stationed in Calcutta and 500 overseas Chinese, and 1,000 British people came to the airport to welcome him. He stopped for two days and flew to Yangon. On the way, the motor leaked oil and he was forced to land. He arrived in Yangon on July 13th and was welcomed by overseas Chinese and the authorities. Continuing to fly to Bangkok, he encountered heavy rain again on the way to Annam. The clouds were high and the mountains were steep, so he turned back and landed in Pakse. He was detained by the French garrison for two days. Later, the French garrison was released after receiving a reply from General Fache, the French garrison. He flew to Hanoi and continued to fly after the Hanoi airfield was bad, part of the plane was burned again, and he continued to fly, 20 meters above the ground. The tail of the plane suddenly broke, and the plane was out of control. At that time, more than 200 people at the airport lost their color. Re-landing in the field, French garrison commander Lager Fache personally expressed his admiration and condolences, and ordered the railway workers in the garrison to repair it. He flew to Hanoi and arrived in Guangzhou on the 20th, Changsha on the 23rd, and finally the capital on the 24th. Sun led reporters to visit the plane, which is a wooden Klem-style monoplane painted yellow, named "Aviation to Save the Country". The tail has a party emblem on one side and a national flag on the other. The plane weighs 456 kilograms, has a load of 235 kilograms, has 90 horsepower, and flies at 145 to 175 kilometers per hour. The cost is 20,000 yuan. The fuselage is very small and can only accommodate one person. Sun is from Jiahe, Hebei, 26 years old, the younger brother of Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 26th division. After graduating from middle school, he served in the army. In the 17th year, the government sent him to study in Germany, where he entered the Klem factory and Siemens factory for a year of internship and studied at the German Aviation School, Sports Aircraft School, National Aviation School, Gliding Aircraft School, and finally entered the National Jiaotong Aviation School, specializing in heavy aircraft. He graduated this year. Sun believes that China has a vast territory and aviation is still in its infancy. To resist foreign aggression, we must actively build air defense. Since September 18th, his ambition has become more firm. He took advantage of the three-month vacation after graduating from the Jiaotong Aviation School to fly back to China, so that our blue and white national emblem can soar in the alien sky. Sun plans to fly to Jinan on the 25th to visit his father. After the vacation, he will return to Germany to study aircraft manufacturing at the university. On the evening of the 24th, the capital's press held a grand banquet to welcome him. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Sun Tonggang, a graduate of the Berlin Jiaotong University in Germany, flew his "Aviation to Save the Country" long-distance flight plane from Germany on June 26th to return to China. After passing through more than twenty stations, he arrived in Guangzhou on July 22nd and flew to Changsha on the 23rd. On the morning of the 24th, he came to Hankou from Hunan and arrived at the port at 10:10 am, landing at Wangjiadun Airfield. Personnel from the aviation industry here came to take care of him and provided him with courteous hospitality. The plane is a war-wing-style long-distance flight plane. Because Sun urgently needed to go to Beijing, he added oil and rested for more than ten minutes, then boarded the plane and flew east again. He is expected to arrive in Beijing at one o'clock at noon. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Capital Press Hosts a Banquet to Welcome Him <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The press corps hosted a welcome banquet for aviator Sun Tonggang at the Central Hotel tonight, attended by more than 60 people. Sun is 26 years old and from Jiahe County, Hebei. He studied in Germany for four years, studying German in the first year and driving in the second, third, and fourth years. Sun is full of energy and does not appear tired, saying that he is tired from working on the plane and asks to be excused from a long report and give it tomorrow at a reception held by various circles. The press unanimously elected Cheng Zhongxing to give a speech, stating that Sun Jun's individual flight of a small plane for a long distance of 30,000 miles is not only unprecedented in our country, but the achievements of famous aviators in the world are also only so. Mr. Sun is not only the only great aviator in China but can also be ranked among the world's great aviators. The situation of being welcomed by the countries and nations of Austria, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Persia, India, etc. shows that this trip to Beijing is worthy of our welcome. In recent years, the major reason for our country's failure against the enemy has been that aircraft are inferior to the enemy. The most anxious and attention-grabbing topic of our country and society in recent years has also been the same topic of aircraft. Now that Mr. Sun has this success, it is a great consolation. We hope that the countrymen will be inspired by Mr. Sun's hard work to jointly study and improve aviation technology day by day. In the future, the function of aircraft will not only be limited to developing transportation and revitalizing the shipping industry, but the important issue will be to use aircraft for national defense. Then, the restoration of the nation and the wiping out of national humiliation will depend on aviation technology. Mr. Sun, work hard! Then, a photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. Sun originally planned to go to Ji on the 25th, but was firmly retained by all walks of life, and the civil exhibition was postponed to the 26th to fly north. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it has gained military advantages to realize its decades-long ambition to dominate the East Asian continent. However, diplomatically, it has been isolated. Britain, originally Japan's ally, had very close relations with Japan in terms of political interests in the Far East, and their stances on the Soviet Union were also quite consistent. However, with the rise of the economic bloc movement, Japan, seeking to control the Far East, first advocated the so-called "Japan-Manchukuo Alliance" and then subtly implied its opposition to Europe and the United States. Therefore, cracks had long existed between Britain and Japan. Recently, since the failure of the World Economic Conference, the contradictions between international cooperation and national economic protectionism have become increasingly apparent. Major countries have all devoted themselves to national protection and self-defense. Japan's foreign policy has also undergone a fundamental shift. Although it can no longer afford to engage in conflict with Britain, it is already in a hostile position with Britain in the markets of Southeast Asia and India. And in North Manchuria with the Soviet Union, the situation is even more acute. Now, the world knows that the Soviet Union and Japan's puppet state are conducting negotiations in Tokyo on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union, on the surface, continues to maintain its peaceful stance, expressing its willingness to sell it at a reasonable price. Japan and its puppet state, on the other hand, are seeking to expand their military strength in the Northeast and to economically erode the Chinese Eastern Railway, subjecting it to the dual control of the Japanese army and the "South Manchuria Railway," hoping to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway at a low price.</p>
<p>The reason for actively seizing the Chinese Eastern Railway, even before the completion of the Jihui Railway, Yanji-Sanxing Railway, and Labin Railway, is that all countries in the world are striving for their own domestic development, and internationally, they are mostly focused on self-sufficiency and striving to strengthen their military preparations. During this period, Japan, seeing the effectiveness of its aggressive policies, wants to implement further aggression. The previous so-called military actions were still justified by the pretext of preventing communism and maintaining peace in the Far East. Now, they say that the period of temporary handling of the military situation in the three northeastern provinces has passed. From now on, they will permanently station troops in the Northeast and establish standing divisions. The number of troops and the location of the headquarters have not been determined, but it is undoubtedly clear that they intend to permanently station a large number of troops in the Northeast, build fortifications within our three eastern provinces and Jehol, and prepare for future international wars. This is one aspect of Japan's active preparation for war. Furthermore, Japan's budget this year allocated only 448 million yen for army expenditures and 375 million yen for the navy. However, the military budget for next year, although the figures have not been determined, the army's demand will be no less than 550 million yen, and the navy has a new warship construction plan, the cost of which is expected to exceed 600 million yen. Just looking at the army and navy expenditures, it is not just a quasi-wartime budget but is advancing to a wartime budget. This is the second aspect of Japan's active preparation for war. Currently, Japan's overseas expansion, although it can be considered successful in the Northeast, still cannot solve its urgent needs, and the promising markets of India and Southeast Asia are all</p>
<p>restricted by the economic bloc within the British Empire. Therefore, they are still paying attention to the mainland of our country, expanding their economic influence on one hand and provoking political disputes on the other, threatening us to stop technical cooperation with the League of Nations so that they can seize the opportunity to monopolize it. This is the third aspect of Japan's active preparation for war. We are well aware that Japan, as a maritime power, has a strong army not directed at the Soviet Union but at our country. Now, they are using the Chinese Eastern Railway issue as a wedge, locking down Manchuria in the west and sealing off Suifenhe in the east, and engaging in various kinds of propaganda against the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Red Army is actively deploying in Eastern Siberia, which they can use as an excuse to massively increase troops in the four northeastern provinces. This is the fourth aspect of Japan's active preparation for war.</p>
<p>Given these four aspects, although Sino-Japanese relations have temporarily eased due to the North China Agreement, Japan's policy towards China has not changed. The so-called peace is merely a deceptive term for diplomatic purposes.</p>

<p>Hull Will Propose a Limit of Three Months</p>
<p>Major Deletions to the Economic Report</p>
<p>Currency Committee Met in Detail Yesterday</p>
<p>(London) At the final meeting of the World Economic Conference on July 27, the US chief delegate, Hull, will propose in his speech that the recess period be approximately a maximum of three months. It is heard that Hull's proposal, presented at the plenary meeting of the Economic Committee last week, was well received. His proposal argues that the governments of the countries attending the World Economic Conference should, during the recess period, undertake to establish an agreement to no longer set up new trade barriers and agree to gradually reduce existing barriers. However, any agreement on stopping the setting up of new barriers may be subject to reservation conditions, such as the imposition of taxes on dumped goods. It also advocates that this agreement should be observed by the governments of the countries. Once the governments of the countries accounting for fifty percent of world international trade have accepted it, it will be implemented, and its effective period is indefinite, but it can be terminated one year after implementation with one month's notice.

<p>(London) The economic part of the World Economic Conference has concluded, and the currency part awaits the opening of the plenary session, so the representatives now have time to attend to their private affairs. The revised report of the Economic Committee has removed some of the language extravagantly describing its achievements. When the Currency Committee met today, the chairman, Cox, presented the achievements of the committee somewhat lavishly, but it is feared that the plenary session will follow the example of the Economic Committee, and the optimistic conclusions in the report will be deleted. The wheat agreement seemed very likely to be concluded last week, but the atmosphere today is rather bleak. However, Chairman Morgenthau is not yet pessimistic. The US dollar opened at 4 shillings and 6.4 pence on the London foreign exchange market, then fell to 4 shillings and 7 pence, and finally returned to 4 shillings and 6.8 pence. (Reuters telegram from the 24th) (London) The core committee of the presidium of the Economic Conference met at 10 a.m., chaired by British Prime Minister MacDonald, to determine the proposals to be submitted to the plenary session of the presidium tomorrow afternoon. After the meeting, the general impression was that MacDonald strongly advocated stipulating the procedures for resuming the work of the Economic Conference. This procedure should clearly define the timing of the second session of the Economic Conference, which seems to be determined by the core committee. The core committee is composed of the chair and vice-chair of the Economic Conference, the chair and vice-chair of the Currency and Economic Committees, and the rapporteurs.

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announces</p>
<h3 id="e19">Full Text of the Silver Agreement <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will release the full text of the Nine-Power Silver Agreement, which was signed in London the day before yesterday, at 2 p.m. on the 24th. It has six articles. (Central News Agency telegram from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Silver Agreement was signed in London on the 22nd. It is now known that the full text is as follows: India, China, and Spain, countries with silver reserves, and Mexico, the United States, Canada, Peru, Bolivia, Australia, and Japan, major silver-producing countries, because the governments of India and Spain are willing to sell a portion of their silver reserves, and because major silver-producing countries absorb raw silver into their treasuries to offset the silver being sold, which is beneficial to the major silver-producing countries, and because the sale of silver obtained from currency can be offset by the aforementioned purchase, to obtain stable silver prices, which is beneficial to China, and because the amount of silver sold from currency is limited in accordance with the following articles, an agreement is hereby established as follows: (1) The Indian government agrees that the amount sold annually in 1934 shall average 35 million fine ounces. The total amount of silver sold within four years from January 1, 1934, shall not exceed 140 million fine ounces. If the number sold in a certain year is less than 35 million fine ounces, it may be sold in subsequent years, but the total amount sold each year shall be limited to 50 million fine ounces. The above clause does not apply to India's sale of silver to any government for the purpose of reselling US bonds. (2) Major silver-producing countries shall not sell silver during the period to which this agreement applies and shall purchase a total of 35 million fine ounces annually from the raw silver of their mineral production starting in 1934. (3) The raw silver purchased in the above item shall be placed in the national treasury within the four-year period of this item for various monetary purposes, or for simple preservation. (4) The Chinese government agrees not to sell the raw silver obtained from melting down currency for a period of four years from January 1, 1934. (5) The Spanish government or the Bank of Spain agrees not to sell more than 5 million fine ounces of raw silver annually for a period of four years from January 1, 1934. (6) This agreement shall take effect from the date of ratification after acceptance by the governments of the countries and must be ratified before April 1, 1934. However, each ratifying country shall still be effective if it is prepared to purchase the stipulated amount of silver in accordance with the method of the above-mentioned second clause, even if one or more major silver-producing countries have not ratified it at that time. Any government that notifies that it has taken the necessary positive actions to implement the purpose of this agreement, this notification shall be regarded as a ratification document. Also, the US government should take the necessary steps to complete the plan of this agreement. (Central News Agency telegram from the 24th)</p>
<p>Establishment of Silver Agreement</p>
<h3 id="e20">All Parties Express Satisfaction <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Believe it Will Greatly Benefit</p>
<p>Increasing Trade and Raising Silver Prices</p>
<p>(London) After the establishment of the Silver Agreement, all parties involved are extremely satisfied. The US delegation believes that the signing of the agreement will greatly benefit the improvement of global commerce and the increase of silver prices. The Canadian delegation believes that Canada is a silver-producing country, so it goes without saying that it will obtain direct benefits after the agreement is established, and the purchasing power of the Far Eastern countries will also increase as a result, which is especially beneficial to Canada. Indian people believe that the content of the agreement is quite beneficial to India, because according to the agreement, India can sell a portion of its silver reserves without causing silver prices to fall. Regarding this, the Chinese representative believes that the volatility of silver prices is extremely harmful to the development of international trade, and this agreement is a tool to prevent volatility.

<p>(London) One of the clear results of the World Economic Conference is seen in the Silver Agreement today. The agreement stipulates that India's silver sales will be limited to 35 million ounces per year and Spain's to 5 million ounces per year within four years starting from January 1, 1934. At the same time, silver-producing countries must purchase 35 million ounces of mined silver annually. Everyone is very satisfied with this agreement. Pittman said today that this is the greatest event of his life. Negotiations were conducted throughout yesterday, and unanimous agreement was almost reached in the evening. The representatives then adjourned, and the agreement was slightly revised orally to allow each representative to sign the first word. All representatives except Chinese Dr. Yan Huiqing had signed the first word last night. Everyone then went to find Dr. Yan, and finally Pittman's secretary returned this morning with the document signed by Dr. Yan. (Reuters telegram from the 23rd)</p>

<p>The report of the Bombay Silver Agreement caused excitement in the gold and silver exchange here, resulting in midnight trading. The bulls were elated and hastily raised silver prices by two rupees without studying the detailed meaning of the new plan. After the detailed telegram was published, it was realized that the silver position in the monetary world had changed very little, and the bulls were disappointed. Although the market had closed, they still sold what they had bought last night, causing the market price to fall again. The local market is watching and waiting for the reaction of other markets. According to business people, the Bombay silver furnace can barely cope with more than 35 million ounces per year, and the average amount of silver sold by the Indian government in the past from destroyed currency has never exceeded 35 million ounces either.

<h3 id="e23">Allows Gold Dollar to Fluctuate <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Temporarily No Steps to Stabilize</p>
<p>Rumors of US Treasury Secretary Woodin Resigning</p>
<p>(Washington) Although there are widespread rumors tonight that some bankers and people in the securities industry have anticipated that the US government will announce its attitude towards further inflating the currency soon, those close to the government say that it is heard that the US president intends to temporarily allow the gold dollar to fluctuate and will wait until prices reach a satisfactory level and seem to be stable before seeking to stabilize the gold dollar. At that time, only redefining the gold content of the gold dollar will be the basis for stabilization. Furthermore, the president has not yet implemented any real or substantial inflation. The current currency trend is entirely to tighten industry and commerce. Therefore, Senator Thomas, who had previously drafted an amendment authorizing the president to redefine the value of the gold dollar, today advised the president to begin substantive inflation so that wheat prices could rise to $1.50. According to Thomas, the inflation of the currency so far has been entirely psychological. Even if the government authorizes the Federal Reserve to purchase national securities and implement unemployment reduction and construction plans, slightly inflating credit (i.e., lending), the increase in the prices of goods and securities is largely due to the general expectation of inflation rather than real inflation. The plan he has planned authorized the president to issue national circulation notes of 300,000 million yuan, and the time to start issuing them has now arrived. Although abandoning the gold standard and accepting silver for the repayment of war debts has caused the gold dollar exchange rate to plummet, he still does not consider it a real currency inflation plan. (National News Agency telegram from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since rumors of Treasury Secretary Woodin resigning next month have resurfaced here, several parties have today predicted that his successor will be Senator Couzens, who attended the Economic Conference. Couzens is now on his way back to the country. Although he belongs to the Progressive Republican Party, he has assisted the US president's economic plan no less than the Democratic leaders, and the president has compensated the Progressive Republican Party with the Treasury seat. Couzens is the most suitable successor at this time. It is reported that since the Senate committee thoroughly investigated the Morgan Silver Company and discovered that Woodin had received special treatment to participate in several securities transactions, leading to attacks from the Republican Party, there have been rumors of his imminent resignation. Although Woodin has not made any statements on this, people here believe that Woodin will soon relinquish his position, given that his health was not very good last month. As for the rumors that Secretary of State Hull and the US president have disagreements, they are gradually dying down. According to what has been heard today, Hull will remain in office after returning to the country. According to friends of the president, there are no major differences between the two.

<p>Issues Informal Statement to Issue Warning</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, countries around the world have actively aided China with loan policies or the supply of weapons. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued an unofficial statement on the 24th, expressing its absolute opposition. Its content stated that the Chinese government has sent representatives to the United States or Europe to secretly operate, and there are facts that countries are lending to China or supplying weapons. This result will only intensify China's civil war or achieve the purpose of resisting Japan. The Japanese government opposes such a policy towards China by countries. If countries continue to maintain such an attitude, the Japanese government will take appropriate measures to stop them. (Nippon News Agency telegram from the 24th)</p>

<p>Domestic Dissatisfaction is Very High</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Four months have passed since withdrawing from the League of Nations, and Japan has only signed the Japan-Netherlands arbitration treaty. The most important issues in Japanese diplomacy, the issues with the United States, Russia, and China, have not been actively addressed. Relations with China and Russia remain unclear. As for relations with Britain, although there is economic pressure from the British and Indian governments, there are no appropriate and effective countermeasures. Even the Japan-US arbitration treaty is only at its beginning and has not developed into a diplomatic issue. Uchida's diplomacy is gradually suspected of being a policy of inaction. There is also dissatisfaction with the Foreign Ministry, and it is argued that after withdrawing from the League of Nations, when countries are imposing political and economic pressure on Japan, Japan should not remain passive and inactive but should actively seek to develop diplomatic relations. It is heard that the military and political circles have considerable support for this, and important recommendations will soon be made to Foreign Minister Uchida by powerful parties.

<p>(Moscow) Tonight, the Soviet Russian Foreign Ministry officially denied rumors that Russian troops are concentrating on the Manchurian border, attempting to attack Manchuria, saying that the rumors originated in Manchuria and spread throughout the world, but Japanese officials in Manchuria have long stated that there is no evidence to support them. The reason for this is likely due to the impasse in the Tokyo negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet Russian government hereby officially declares that there is no troop movement, no concentration on the Manchurian border, and no intention to seize Manchuria.

<p>Zhang Tian (transliteration), a representative dispatched by the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation of Singapore, arrived in Singapore today. According to his statement, the Overseas Chinese Federation was founded by Sun Yat-sen sixteen years ago, and its headquarters were established in Shanghai the following year. The president at that time was Li Jigong (transliteration), and the members included Li Denghui, the president of Fudan University, and representatives from Singapore, Penang, and Malaysia. The purpose of the Federation is to assist overseas Chinese in industrial investments at home and abroad, protect overseas Chinese merchants, and raise the status of Chinese people internationally. Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, Siam, and other places have joined the association. In response to requests from overseas Chinese, the Federation has assisted unemployed overseas Chinese who have returned to the country or have been expelled from their place of residence, assisted in the educational system of schools established by overseas Chinese overseas, and encouraged overseas Chinese investment in the motherland. The Overseas Chinese Federation has now established a hospital in Shanghai, specializing in serving overseas Chinese who have returned to the country, and has established a special department to encourage the investigation of the situation in Southeast Asia and to assist overseas Chinese returning to and leaving the country.

<p>Japanese Consider it a Great Insult</p>
<p>Will Take Similar Retaliatory Measures</p>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun reported on July 18 that after Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, every time Japanese people land in American ports, they are subjected to mandatory venereal disease checks. This insulting behavior has caused great agitation among the Japanese residents. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, believing that the United States is disregarding international etiquette and disregarding humanity, has proposed strong countermeasures and retaliatory measures. Since the end of last year, passengers on Japanese ships such as Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, Kokusai Kisen, and other Japanese ships have been subjected to venereal disease checks in ports such as Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New Orleans, and San Francisco. Recently, when crew members (Japanese) of the post ship Asama Maru landed at a certain port, the US Customs ordered all the Japanese people to gather on the deck and undergo an evil check completely naked. Also, Osaka Shosen, which entered the port of New Orleans, conducted an extremely rude and indescribable check, which made the Japanese people unusually unhappy. After receiving reports from various consuls, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have lodged a serious protest. If the US government continues this inhuman behavior (examining the male and female genitals of Japanese people one by one), then Japan will also adopt the same retaliatory measures for American ships entering the country. In the future, it will abandon its weak diplomatic policy and switch to a tough approach. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must do so to promote national prestige and protect Japanese residents.

It is necessary to choose excellent materials that are completely without pores, and to prevent people from climbing the fence to peep and to prevent giant buildings around from observing with telescopes, it is necessary to make the fence reach the sky."

<p>Ye Chu Cang ·· Conscience and Capability</p>
<p>Zhang Ji ·· How to Consolidate the Party Foundation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week at 9:00 AM on the 24th. Over 400 people attended, including Lin Xiang, Li Yuanding, He Yaozu, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and staff of the National Government. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. National Government member Lai Chu Cang reported, roughly stating that recently, various counties in eastern Henan have begun to be taken over, the puppet army has been reorganized, and the river water has receded. The situation seems to be easing, but in reality, it is still serious. It would be most dangerous if the people's morale were to relax as a result. As the saying goes, "Closing the door after the thief has left" implies blaming someone for not preparing in advance. However, if the thief has not left and the door is still not closed, it is even worse. There are many ways to prepare, but the most important is to strengthen human resources. The starting point for strengthening human resources is to seek the enrichment of the "heart" first. The scorching heat is oppressive, and actions are difficult. If an emergency occurs, one should still get up and dress, even if it is more tiring than usual, yet one does not feel the heat. This is driven by one's capability. Even in the depths of winter, one often feels shivering. However, if someone suddenly points out one's wrongdoing, the shame is overwhelming, and one's face will turn red and sweat. This is due to the function of conscience. Based on this conscience and capability, expanding and developing it is the way to enrich one's inner strength. In the Party anthem written by the Premier, there is a phrase "swear to be diligent and brave." The word "diligent" is the foundation for developing one's capability. The meaning of diligence seems ordinary, but it is not easy to put into practice. It is already difficult to find someone with diligent training among ordinary people. We are in difficult times and should put more effort into "diligence" to strengthen human resources. Then, financial and material resources will follow. I urge myself to be diligent and encourage my comrades with this. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial week at 8:00 AM on the 24th. Chen Guofu, Zhang Ji, Xiao Jishan, Huang Jichen, Zheng Zhannan, Wang Qi, Ji Ciwen, and all staff members attended. Chairman Chen Guofu presided, and Zhang Ji reported, roughly stating that he has been traveling frequently in North China recently and has many feelings about what he has witnessed. The national crisis is serious and has reached its extreme. Generally, people blame the Party, saying that the measures are not good. At the same time, some comrades within the Party are also losing confidence. It should be known that the country's current situation is not the fault of the Party, nor is it the mistake of the revolution. It is truly because the people have not worked hard to follow the Premier's teachings and build the country according to the Three Principles of the People. Recently, some people have advocated opening up political power and implementing the Premier's founding program, which instructs us to return political power to the people, not to hand over political power to a few politicians and ambitious individuals, calling it "open." What benefit would this bring to the country? Recently, all reactionaries have taken the opportunity to attack, and the Party's foundation is becoming increasingly shaky. All comrades of the Party must uphold a spirit of perseverance and fortitude. (1) The Party is a revolutionary party, not a political party. Therefore, it is extremely important to restore the revolutionary spirit, strictly abide by the Premier's teachings, and fight to the end. (2) Correct erroneous views on life, cultivate a spirit of hard work and self-encouragement, not avoid difficulties, go deep into the countryside, promote the ideology, and do practical construction work. Only then can we talk about consolidating the Party's foundation and revitalizing the country. Time is pressing, and we cannot afford to hesitate any longer.

<p>(Nanjing) Supervisor Zhou Lisheng of the Control Yuan, based on a complaint filed by Li Liejun and others, stated that Xiong Shihui, Chairman of Jiangxi, had unauthorizedly collected production and sales taxes and requested the Executive Yuan to take swift remedial measures. The Control Yuan recently received a reply from the Executive Yuan, stating that the Jiangxi Provincial Government had reported that the province's implementation of production and sales donations, after being ordered to switch to business tax, had been planned and prepared for some time before there was any progress. They secretly intended to gradually implement the plan, believing it would be easier. Therefore, in December of last year, they first started collecting business tax on porcelain, with the rest to be implemented gradually. Unexpectedly, banditry became increasingly rampant, and commerce declined, preventing its realization. They will wait until the banditry is slightly quelled before changing the plan again. At that time, the production and sales taxes can be completely abolished, etc. In addition to instructing compliance with the previous order to expedite the planning and implementation of business tax and abolish the production and sales donations, the corresponding consultation is requested for reference.

<p>Says the Principles are Beyond Reproach</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Datong News Agency reporter asked Chen Gongbo about the details of the cotton and wheat loan. Chen replied that this cotton and wheat loan is very beneficial to our country, and the principles are beyond reproach. When asked how we will remedy the situation as the dumping of goods by various countries on China greatly affects the development of our country's trade market, he replied that due to the bankruptcy of China's social economy in recent years, even if foreign goods come to China and are dumped at low prices, we feel unable to purchase them. Therefore, although foreign countries are dumping on us, it is not seen that they can obtain much benefit. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<p>Disposal of Income from the Zhengtai Railway</p>
<h3 id="e46">Ministry of Railways Rejects Belgian Proposal <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An official from the Ministry of Railways stated that the French loan contract for the Zhengtai Railway had expired, and the loan had also been repaid at the same time. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to take back the railway on December 25th of last year and manage it themselves. After taking over, the Ministry of Railways, due to the need for funds for the Huayin and Weinan sections of the Longhai Railway, ordered the Zhengtai Railway to allocate 100,000 yuan per month for a period of eight months, using the funds previously used to repay the principal and interest of the French loan to expand the Longhai Railway. This does not affect the Belgian company's loan guarantee. The construction costs of the Longhai Railway were also borrowed from the Belgian company. Now, because the income of the Longhai Railway is not strong, the interest on the loan from the Belgian company has also been delayed for a long time. Now that our country is willing to use the surplus from another railway to expand the Longhai Railway, the intention is to increase the income of the Longhai Railway in order to reorganize the old debt of the Longhai Railway. Although the Belgian company is well aware that this move does not affect its interests, it fears that the income of the Zhengtai Railway will decrease in the future, and it will have nothing to rely on. Therefore, under the pretext that the loan contract has expired, it demands that our country recognize the company as the first creditor, and that the income of the railway bureau must be used to pay the principal and interest of the company's loan first. Only if there is a surplus can it be used for other purposes. Its intention is nothing more than to oppose our country's independent disposal of the railway's income. The Ministry of Railways has already refuted this based on reason. Although the company still insists, it may not persist to the end. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, the rains have been adequate in our fort, and the crops are growing well. The people are delighted and expect a bumper harvest. Unexpectedly, around 4 PM on the 21st day of the leap fifth month of the lunar calendar, dark clouds gathered, and the darkness was extreme. Lightning flashed, and thunder roared. In an instant, heavy rain fell, and after a few minutes, it turned into hail, some pieces as large as apricots and others as small as beans.

<p>Tang Zhongfu, a representative of the people of Dingbian County, recently came to the province to appeal for aid. He reported that since the 13th year of the Republic [1924], droughts have followed one after another, resulting in labor without harvest. In the 17th year [1928], strong yellow winds howled, and not a drop of rain fell. At that time, sixty to seventy percent of the people fled. In the 19th year [1930], they suffered from rat infestations, making the scene even more tragic. As a result, two-thirds to three-quarters of the people lost their property and became displaced. In the past two years, there have been signs of severe drought. Crops in the fields have been abandoned after sowing. Living people have turned to death, and piles of white bones have formed. The death rate is incalculable.</p>

<p>In中部 on June 9th, at 4 p.m., black clouds gathered and thunder rumbled faintly. In an instant, a hailstorm broke out, with pieces like chicken eggs and small stones, accumulating to over a foot deep on the ground. Wheat ears were broken, broad beans were destroyed, and there was no hope for the autumn harvest. Mournful cries of the people were everywhere, truly pitiful. The county magistrate, Wei Jichuan, has already petitioned the provincial relief committee for aid.</p>

The hail was as small as chicken egg yolks or walnuts, and as large as rice bowls. All mature wheat and beans, as well as early autumn crops, were beaten into the mud. Fifty-five people and seventy-four cattle were killed. Furthermore, due to the disaster caused by this hailstorm, people lacked the means to survive. Some entire families were begging at the same time, while others were committing suicide by jumping into wells. The suffering was so terrible that one could not bear to witness it. He pleaded for the swift allocation of large sums of money and the dispatch of personnel to provide relief. The provincial government, upon hearing the news, has instructed the provincial relief committee to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Investigation of the Wuchang Gold Digging Case is Nearing Completion <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>= New gold cellars were discovered in the gold digging site, but there was nothing inside. Another gold cellar was discovered in the Liushi area of Huangkang County =</p>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The gold cellar dispute at Kong Geng's residence in Wuchang, which was triggered by the encroachment and unauthorized digging by his neighbor, Peng Younan, has caused a major controversy. The entire committee of the investigation team inspected the cellar site and unearthed two thousand taels of silver ingots and fragmented silver. A new cellar was also discovered. At that time, Kong Geng disputed the ownership issue with the investigation committee, leading to the entire committee resigning in anger and requesting the garrison headquarters to select new committee members to take over. The original report stated, "The committee members, following your instructions, organized a gold digging investigation committee, which was established on the 12th of this month and commenced work. All progress has been reported to you in person. Currently, obstacles have arisen in the course of the investigation, and the committee members are unable to fulfill their responsibilities due to a lack of competence. After a meeting, it was decided that all members will resign collectively, which is recorded in the minutes. Therefore, we submit this document for your review and approval to select new members to take over, which would be more convenient." The so-called obstacles likely refer to the prevention of excavation by the Kong family. Kong insisted on ownership, while the investigation committee argued for the right to discovery. Neither side would concede, resulting in a stalemate. However, although Kong is disputing ownership, it is still for the purpose of overseeing distribution and for public benefit, not for personal gain. The investigation committee members were nominated by various agencies and organizations and have no intention of personal enrichment. Therefore, although there are disagreements, they can be easily explained. On the 20th, the police department instructed all investigation committee members, stating, "The committee has been established for a week, and although there is no concrete solution to the case, a general outline has emerged. Continuing the investigation will lead to an early conclusion. Further changes will increase the difficulty of gathering evidence. The committee members were selected by various government offices and legal groups to uphold justice. Avoiding difficulties and seeking comfort is unacceptable. Recently, news media have been critical. To respect public opinion and the plaintiff's altruistic intentions, you are requested to jointly assume responsibility and actively handle the matter fairly, without hesitation. Your resignation is rejected." At the same time, Kong Geng published a notice in various newspapers, stating that he had not changed his original stance. The investigation committee then announced their reinstatement and decided to excavate the new cellar on the 21st, which Kong also supported. At 2 PM that afternoon, the committee members, including Yu Jusun, and Zhou, the director of the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, led several police officers to the cellar site and ordered workers to excavate. Kong also invited Jin Jutang, the chief of staff of the Garrison Department, to supervise in person to ensure caution. Unexpectedly, after excavation, the so-called new cellar contained no gold, silver, or treasures, only scattered bricks and piles of soil. The investigation committee, believing that the mystery had been solved and that further investigation was unnecessary, requested the Garrison Department and the Public Security Bureau to immediately withdraw the guarding troops and police. They then consulted and decided to strictly investigate Peng Younan's unauthorized digging, based on the original plan. It is said that the committee had already gathered a great deal of evidence on this matter, but the discovery of the new cellar caused complications. It is now scheduled to hold another investigation meeting on the 24th, at which a decision will be made. The conclusion of the case is not far off.</p>
<p>While the gold cellar dispute at the Kong residence was unfolding, another incident of gold cellar discovery occurred in Liujiaxia Bay, Yangying Ridge, Huangkang County. The excavated items included thirteen catties of red gold, which were also hidden by Liu Changmao (Liu Weizhen). Liu was originally from Huangkang but resided in Wuchang. Both places contained many hidden treasures. The simultaneous discovery of two gold cellars is considered a rare event. The discoverer of the Huangkang gold cellar was Liu Genius, a member of the Liu clan. (July 21st)</p>

The monks of the local Buddhist Association and Buddhist laymen Wu Bogeng and Wu Chengfu jointly organized the Universal Benefit Dharma Assembly. From the 22nd to the 24th, they gathered monks from various temples and over 300 members of the Buddhist Association to devoutly chant scriptures in the main hall of the Xilin Temple for three days. Today marks the end of the assembly. In the evening, they will perform the Rite of Releasing the Burning Mouths. For days, those attending this grand event have been extremely numerous.</p>

<p>In the case of Han Wentai, the head of Xu Xie Township (Yangming Township) in the third district, who was kidnapped and tragically killed by bandits, the Public Security Bureau's detective team captured seven kidnappers, including Li Zhiping, at the Yuchun Teahouse in Shanghai. Li Zhiping and Yuan Yonghe were escorted back to Wuxi from Shanghai by court police officer Chen Zuosheng, accompanied by the political affairs police chief Wu Zhengrong, and were interrogated and detained by the County Court Procuratorate. The remaining five, including Jiang Hanchen, were not brought back to Wuxi. It is now known that during the third court hearing at the Shanghai First Special District Court on the 21st of this month, Jiang Hanchen was absent due to illness. His lawyer, Zhuang Chengyi, appeared in court to defend him. Ni Jingqing, the owner of Chenghe Porcelain Shop in Shanghai and Jiang's guarantor, requested to withdraw his guarantee in court due to the seriousness of the case. Lawyer Zhuang persuaded him to continue as the guarantor. For the sake of caution, he also assigned four shop assistants to take turns guarding Jiang to prevent his escape and avoid suffering heavy losses. Unexpectedly, Jiang took advantage of the shop assistants' deep sleep around 3 AM that night and managed to climb onto the roof and descend using a telephone pole, escaping without a trace. After being discovered, it was too late to catch him. The guarantor, Ni Jingqing, was shocked and immediately reported the escape to the Special District Court, requesting his arrest. After receiving the report, the Special Court, believing that Jiang's escape indicated a strong suspicion in the Han Wentai case, ordered his arrest. Chen Fugen, Ding Fugui, Jin Hengpei, and Hu Shifu, who were released, have not been apprehended despite repeated orders from the police. They remain at large, which is extremely egregious. The Court has also instructed its subordinates to issue a unified arrest warrant and requested public security agencies in various counties to assist in their apprehension for interrogation and trial. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu of this county, considering the importance of this case, will bring Li Zhiping and Yuan Yonghe, who have already been escorted back to Wuxi, to the county government within the next few days for questioning with Yang Abao and Zhou Shungen, in order to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather in our county has been extremely dry and hot, with the Fahrenheit temperature reaching around 100 degrees. In the past two days, there has been a slight drizzle, and the weather has become somewhat cooler. Unexpectedly, around 3 PM the day before yesterday in Ge Da Bridge, Kaihua Township, 14th District of the county, snow suddenly began to fall from the sky for about 10 minutes, but the snowflakes were very thin and small. At the time, dark clouds covered the sky, and the weather was suddenly colder than usual. The local residents were amazed.</p>

<p>Zhang Zongren, a first-class clerk from the Nanjing Finance Bureau, a native of Jiangpu, and 38 years old, came to Wuxi to play with his fellow villagers, Chen Zhuping and others, on the 17th of this month. The day before yesterday afternoon, they went to the park in the city center to drink tea. Shen Keqin, a well-known local rogue and member of the "Eight Gang," was experiencing financial difficulties and discussed with his wife, Hua Fengying, imitating the "honey trap" technique from Shanghai to extort money. Fengying, who was 29 years old and possessed beauty comparable to Pan An and Xi Shi, happened to meet Zhang Zongren in the park that day. She sent him flirtatious glances and conveyed affection with her eyes. Zhang, suddenly seeing a beautiful woman's favor, was so captivated that he thought he was dreaming. They began to pour out their hearts to each other, then hired a car to tour the lake and mountains, whispering sweet nothings, almost wanting to ascend to immortality. That evening, the two went to room 42 of the Dadong Inn, hoping to consummate their relationship. However, just as Fengying was half-heartedly resisting, Shen Keqin and several of his accomplices broke down the door and entered. Fengying feigned panic, while Shen pinned Zhang down and demanded money. Unable to resolve the situation, they were taken to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, where Director Wang held a preliminary hearing and, considering Zhang's status as a public official and his reputation, persuaded them to settle. Zhang paid 50 yuan to resolve the matter. It is said that Zhang's uncle works for the Nanjing City Party Headquarters. Upon hearing the news, he was furious and intends to come to Wuxi to investigate the truth and file a lawsuit to punish Shen.</p>

<p>The police bureau here has been owed wages for three months. Earlier this month, at a police affairs meeting, the officers of each branch bureau once requested their pay. The bureau then released 15,000 yuan as a temporary measure. Now, another half-month has passed, and the meager amount is insufficient to sustain them. Many have accumulated debts and pawned their clothing. The officers of each branch bureau find it unbearable to continue in this situation. They are planning to jointly petition the authorities for their back pay to maintain their livelihoods.</p>

<p>In Lehe County city there is a boathouse on Banbianhe owned by Jiang Ronghe, whose wife, Song, is still young. She is inherently lewd and, since Jiang is out at sea with the boat, she can't stand being alone. She first became acquainted with Zhao Mazi, Sun Aizi, and Jiang Sanlong, who came and went frequently without interruption. Last month Zhao and Song quarreled over a trivial matter and broke up. On the 19th, Zhao suddenly came to Song's house. Neighbor Zheng scolded Song for her lack of affection, declaring that he would interfere if she abandoned Zhao. Sun and Jiang also arrived one after another. The three adulterers quarreled with each other. Jiang Ronghe learned of this and was furious. He scolded Song for not keeping her wifely duty. Unable to bear this humiliation, she conceived a desperate plan, secretly taking opium to commit suicide. When discovered, doctors were called to treat her, but she died. Zhao Mazi, seeing that he had caused the trouble, fled without a trace. Jiang Sanlong then purchased a coffin and collected the body.</p>

When the bandits came to collect the money on the due date, Zhao handed over the borrowed money and knelt down to beg for mercy. The bandits were furious and shot him dead. How tragic.</p>

<p>Two female guests, Shi Jingwen and Li Zhongzhi, arrived at the Lakeside Hotel in Hangzhou yesterday. They had an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and a rattan basket. They booked room number 33 and went to bed with the door closed that night. The next morning, they went out together, leaving the child in the room. The hotel staff initially paid no attention. When they had not returned by noon, suspicions arose. They searched the room and found a note and three silver dollars. The note instructed the staff to send the child to Mrs. Zuo at No. 1 Yingshi Road, West Street. The hotel staff followed the instructions and sent the child to Mrs. Zuo, but Mrs. Zuo refused to accept the child. She said she would contact her when Zhongwei returned to Hangzhou. The child is now temporarily being cared for by Ms. Xu, another female guest in the hotel. This is also a strange and twisted case.</p>

However, local gentry strongly objected, and the dispute remained unresolved. Now, due to business tax collection issues, the Chuzhou County government has requested instructions from the headquarters. The headquarters has issued an order stating that, according to the provincial government's reply, the gentry of the fort have deep-seated territorial prejudices. The allocation will be made after amicable guidance. Temporarily, it remains under the jurisdiction of Chuzhou County.</p>

<p>(申時社 This paper) Yesterday, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association sent a letter to the United Relief Association for Northeast Refugees, requesting the immediate dispatch of personnel to the north to aid wounded soldiers, or donations of medicine and grain, so that the injured heroes can have a place to heal and be more courageous in future battles. Here is the original letter: "Respected Sirs, the three northeastern provinces have fallen for nearly two years, and Rehe has been abandoned for half a year. Humiliating treaties have been signed under the city of Tianjin, and there is no hope of recovering lost territory. Fortunately, General Feng Yuxiang and Fang Zhenwu, along with Deng Wen and Li Zhongyi of Ma Zhanshan's forces, are indignant at the brutality of the Japanese and saddened by the loss of national territory. They have resolutely led the anti-Japanese generals and soldiers to swear an oath in Zhangjiakou to take back lost territory as their mission. They have repeatedly telegraphed statements that their guns will never point inward, showing great righteousness and earning the respect of the nation. Since launching the campaign, they have been unstoppable. They recaptured Kangbao on June 8th, Guyuan on June 10th, and Baochang on June 11th. On July 11th, they joined forces to attack Duolun and completely recaptured it by 9:00 AM. The enemy retreated eastward, and there were no enemy traces in Chahar. The territory of Chahar was preserved thanks to them. The news of the victory has spread, and the whole nation is celebrating. Now, they are urging their troops to march forward. The volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast are also rising up in response and are expected to strike the puppet capital of Changchun soon. However, the enemy will not accept defeat and will certainly not endure it. Reports indicate that the enemy has increased its forces near Rehe by more than 20,000 and is continuing to attack with superior weaponry. Our troops have inferior weapons and lack ammunition, making it difficult to compete. The supply of provisions is frequently interrupted. There are no temporary hospitals at the front, and there is a shortage of essential medicines, causing wounded soldiers to wail in agony. Many commit suicide with their guns because they cannot bear the pain. Since the government is restrained from providing assistance due to treaties, the whole nation should rise up urgently, raise funds to provide aid, rescue the wounded and comfort the dead, and relieve the refugees. This is an unavoidable responsibility. Yesterday, our Association resolved to earnestly request your association to allocate funds, send personnel to implement relief and comfort, or assist with medicines to rescue the dying and heal the wounded, or purchase rice and single clothes to provide shelter and food, so that the injured heroes can have a place to heal and be more courageous. We have long known that you have been actively working to resist the brutality of the Japanese, relieve refugees, and comfort the wounded and dead in the past, sparing no effort, and have been respected by both Chinese and foreigners. Therefore, we earnestly request your approval and prompt action. The revival of the nation depends on it. We respectfully submit this to you, awaiting your reply."</p>

<p>The "Tunan" ship, which was owned by the China Merchants Bureau and was sailing from Yantai to Dalian, was sunk by the "Changchun Maru" of the Japanese-owned Dalian Mail Steamship Company in the waters of Shandong. The China Merchants Bureau quickly handled the aftermath and provided relief to the victims. It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications has decided on two steps to handle this matter. In addition, the Special Party Branch of the Chinese Seamen and the Qingdao Seamen's Union telegraphed yesterday, requesting the authorities to conduct serious negotiations and provide generous compensation to the victims. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>After the "Tunan" ship was sunk by the "Changchun Maru," the Ministry of Communications, after receiving the report, dispatched Gao Tingzi, the director of the Navigation Administration Department, to Shanghai to investigate the truth. He has already returned to the Ministry with a detailed report on the incident. It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications has decided on two steps to handle this matter: The first step is to order the China Merchants Bureau to handle the post-disaster matters for the passengers and crew, such as issuing compensation. After the first step is completed, the second step of negotiations will begin. First, the China Merchants Bureau will negotiate compensation with the Dalian Company. If the company evades responsibility or the negotiations are unsuccessful, the Ministry will request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a protest with the Japanese side. As for the cargo carried by the ship, it will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Maritime Law to ensure that the passengers do not suffer losses.</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Preparatory Office of the Special Party Branch of the Chinese Seamen cabled yesterday: "All levels of seamen's unions, newspapers, and organizations, please note that the state-run China Merchants Bureau's 'Tunan' ship was sunk by the Japanese ship 'Changchun Maru' in Shandong waters, and most of the crew members drowned. The tragedy is self-evident. We believe that our colleagues in the shipping industry, who serve amidst the turbulent waves, cannot avoid such misfortune in reality. However, the authorities of the China Merchants Bureau should work with our leading seamen's organizations to jointly plan for the aftermath, which would be legitimate. However, the bureau has completely entrusted the handling of the affairs of the victims to the Jun'an Society, which has already been explicitly revoked, and is attempting to perfunctorily fulfill its responsibilities by citing the precedent of Xin Kang. Such mistreatment of seamen and disregard for human life not only chills the hearts of our colleagues in the shipping industry but also causes deep resentment among the public. Based on the party's position, this office has (1) presented a letter to the higher party department, (a) sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, adopting effective methods to stop the illegal activities of the Jun'an Society, (2) sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lodging a serious protest with Japan for compensation for losses and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future, (3) sent a letter to the Ministry of Communications, requesting that the China Merchants Bureau generously compensate the families of the victims. We hereby telegraph, vowing to resolutely oppose the China Merchants Bureau's perfunctory approach. We hope that all sectors of the country will unite to support us in order to value human life. The Shanghai District Preparatory Office of the Special Party Branch of the Chinese Seamen."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Seamen's Union received a telegram yesterday from the Provisional Guidance Committee of the Qingdao Seamen's Union: "All members of the Shanghai Chinese Seamen's Union, please note that on the 10th of this month, our China Merchants Bureau's 'Tunan' ship was sunk by the Japanese ship 'Changchun Maru' in less than four minutes, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 crew members and passengers, and losses exceeding 700,000. Although a small number of people were fortunate enough to survive, they are living a miserable existence without adequate relief. The tragic situation is chilling to those who hear of it. We have suffered from continuous internal wars and frequent foreign aggressions in recent years. The lives of our people are as cheap as ants, and our territory is at the mercy of others. The sinking of the 'Tunan' has caused an unprecedented and tragic event, which is due to the weakness of our country and the poverty of our people. In this situation, if we do not take immediate and satisfactory action, not only will the dead be gone, but we, the living, will become the successors of the 'Tunan.' Therefore, after mourning, this union dares to propose three measures: (1) Request the authorities to investigate the truth and conduct serious negotiations. (2) Provide compensation to the families of the deceased. (3) Provide relief to the survivors and compensate them for their losses. In short, we must ensure that the dead rest in peace, the living are safe, and those who have suffered losses receive adequate compensation. Otherwise, this union, leading all the seamen of Qingdao, under the leadership of your union, vows to support this case until a satisfactory outcome is achieved. The telegram is urgent, and we await your instructions."</p>

<p>Since its establishment in late August of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the main work of the National Government Flood Relief Committee has been the three urgent tasks of industrial, agricultural, and social reconstruction, all of which are managed by Zhu Ziqiao, the director of the Disaster Area Working Group of the Committee. Regarding the industrial reconstruction part, the Committee hired Xi Dejiong as the director of the Industrial Reconstruction Office, who worked hard to repair the main dikes of the Jianghuai, Ganhan, Yiluo and Yun rivers. The progress was rapid. This year, during the plum rain season, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River rose sharply. People, mindful of the great flood of the previous year, were filled with fear, as if a great disaster was imminent. Xi took the opportunity to fly to Wuhan himself to supervise the flood control, and fortunately avoided negligence. He recently returned to Shanghai and reported the details to Director Zhu, who was very gratified. Zhu also said to others that if the dikes that were damaged by the great flood of the previous year had not been repaired, or if the repairs had not been completed, the damage from this flood would have been incalculable. Here is an excerpt from Director Zhu's letter to the Industrial Reconstruction Office: "The high water levels along the Yangtze River this summer were almost unprecedented for the same month in nearly a century. The water level in one part of the Han River reached 47 feet and 2 inches. The torrents were surging, and the situation was dangerous. The dikes repaired by our Committee were originally designed to exceed the 20-year flood level by three feet. This time, the water rose, and the dikes were still 4-5 feet and 7-8 feet above the water surface. The dikes were able to be preserved, and the survivors were spared from suffering another disaster. I was very relieved to hear this. Your director has been in charge of the industrial reconstruction work of this group, and your guidance has been excellent. Especially during the emergency of flood prevention, you were able to be stationed in Hanzhong to plan and prevent the situation, taking responsibility bravely. The dikes in Jianli, Jialu, Huangmei, and the Mahua dike at the junction of Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi were either affected by bandits during the construction or suffered other failures, resulting in dikes that were not up to standard and in danger. However, thanks to effective flood control and rescue, they were not damaged. As for the small dikes along the rivers owned by the people, which are not within the scope of industrial reconstruction, even if there are overflows, they have not caused major disasters. The autumn flood season will soon be here. I hope that your director will urge his</p>

<p>The Agony of Late Spring and Mosquito Control Qingqu</p>
<p>It used to be said in the Spring and Autumn Annals, "Heaven does not cease winter because of human dislike for its cold." Now, I'll twist that and say, "Why doesn't Heaven cease summer because of human dislike for its heat?" I imagine everyone, amidst the intense heat and oppressive glare, would agree. Although some might say summer is still better than the cold of winter, because the number of people who can wear heavy furs, use stoves, and live in warm, enclosed rooms is ultimately small. Yet, those who brave frost and snow, enduring hardship, number in the thousands. Not seeing the heavy snow and the huddled figures on the streets, they often get invaded by the cold air at night, resulting in freezing and death on the roads? Then, according to this, even though the heat of summer is high, the general poor people actually benefit quite a bit, living the most comfortable life even while sleeping outdoors.</p>
<p>However, this is only looking at one aspect. If we truly distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, the height of summer is a great enemy of human life. Why? Once the scorching heat arrives, everyone feels somewhat impatient. Speaking lightly, the tiny mosquitoes, born with sharp mouths, when you are tired and want to enjoy a peaceful sleep, they buzz and buzz, disturbing your dreams. Not only do they disrupt your sleep, but they also suck your blood. If you don't swat them until their bodies are like powder, the mosquitoes' bellies will be full, like a red gauze lantern, and finally they will fly away, calling out, "Are you awake yet?" The other day, a friend of mine had an interesting discussion about mosquitoes. Someone advised him to buy a box of Pig Brand mosquito incense, ensuring they would all be killed and he wouldn't suffer from them. Unexpectedly, this friend disagreed greatly. He said, I would never use Japanese products to harm Chinese mosquitoes. I would rather let mosquitoes suck my blood than listen to the Japanese bring my life, alas! These few words truly have a sense of humor, worthy of contemplation!</p>
<p>In fact, getting rid of mosquitoes is not difficult. If there are no weeds in the courtyard and no stagnant water, these eggs will not breed. Even the water tank used daily is most likely to breed mosquitoes. However, to eliminate their seeds, simply take a few snails and raise them in the water, and the wrigglers in the tank will disappear. The interior is generally cleaner. If it's not a bustling market, bedbugs would not usually visit. The only suffering is from mosquitoes, but with careful prevention, these insects are not impossible to get rid of. Even flies, if you pay attention to cleanliness, will have no way to invade, leading to harm to hygiene. As for the annoyance of heat, if you don't feel hot in your heart, you won't sweat profusely. As the saying goes, "A calm heart naturally feels cool." This shows the relationship between psychology and physiology. Sometimes, when the heat is extreme, try thinking of the scene of "high terrace blowing evening wind, white moon shining on the east eaves, arranging new melodies in front of the door, clear light filling the jade zither, looking up at solitary geese flying, listening to the mournful chirping of crickets," and you will naturally feel a cool breeze, caressing my arms, as if transported to a cool world, a different realm altogether, how joyful! Summer Cultivation Rongyu</p>
<p>The weather is so hot, the sun spreads out like a fiery canopy; the water in the small river is scorched, raising small bubbles, as if boiling. At this time, the villagers, both men and women, must go to the fields to work. The lush green rice seedlings are already over a foot tall, arranged neatly. They need the sun to shine on them to grow. They need water for irrigation to prevent withering. They also need human fertilizer to nourish them to thrive. Moreover, they need to have the weeds removed to grow peacefully. Farmers, to adapt to their environment, or rather, hoping for a good harvest, wear bamboo hats, go barefoot, and work in the fields under the scorching sun. The water in the rice fields feels boiling hot. There are also leeches and water leeches desperately trying to bite you. Sweat pours out all over the body, like a fountain. The skin is tanned as dark as a bronze statue. Weeding, pulling grass, and pumping water occupy their days. They don't even have time to take a nap or fan themselves, doing their work desperately. If the harvest is good, they can keep some rice for themselves. If they encounter floods, droughts, or locust plagues, all they get is hard work and wasted effort. It is truly "After gathering nectar from a hundred flowers to make honey, for whom do they toil, for whom do they busy themselves?" Worthy of farmers' lament!</p>
<p>Although cotton is not as troublesome as rice, the soil often needs to be loosened. This loosening work is done slowly, hoeing around the roots, not recklessly like a large-scale project. There is also the removal of weeds, working every two or three days. The hotter the weather, the faster the weeds grow, and the busier the weeding work becomes. Under the scorching sun, women wrap towels around their heads; men wear bamboo hats, also working desperately. "People do not know the hardship of farmers, assuming the grain in the fields grows by itself." City dwellers obtain things easily, but do not know the difficulty of farming. When you have time, please visit the countryside to see for yourself, then you will know "Each grain in the daily meal is the result of hard work!" Cold Words Yu Youqing</p>
<p>People sitting under electric fans complain about the heat, and rickshaw pullers pulling carts on the streets also complain about the heat. This is the equality of heat, without distinction between rich and poor.</p>
<p>Fashionable young ladies showing their legs and coolies baring their torsos are the same, indicating the initial stage of equal rights for men and women. People sleeping in silk-screened rooms may not be as comfortable and sweet as those sleeping on cement floors, which has a philosophical meaning.</p>

<p>Chapter Twelve</p>
<p>Poor and lowly suffer hardship enlisting in the army; a sick man who falls behind willingly resigns; a sentimental soldier</p>
<p>If I were Yang Guizhi, I would definitely be thinking like this in my heart: Zhao's family should come to propose marriage that day, they should come to formally engage that day, and they should choose a wedding date that day. For someone about to become a bride, these are the things one inevitably imagines. However, if I don't go back, wouldn't that mean he couldn't solve the first riddle, and wouldn't he be greatly disappointed? I know about the Yang family's affairs. In this marriage, Guizhi herself can make half the decisions. Now, if Guizhi is offended, then this matter will be mostly difficult to succeed. In the event that things go wrong, wouldn't that fit the saying, "The cooked duck has flown away." Thinking like this, he couldn't put it out of his mind, so how could he sleep peacefully? Lying on the bed, he turns to sleep on his side for a while, then turns to sleep on his back for a while. Although his eyes are closed, his nerves are even more sensitive. Things he couldn't think of while awake, he now thinks of. If I marry Yang Guizhi now, then I will truly have a home. I won't have to have my father, accompanied by a servant, living in a deep courtyard, sewing and mending, cooking and doing everything himself, as if he were a wandering monk. Once a daughter-in-law enters the home, these problems will naturally be easily solved. In another two years, my father will definitely be able to hold a grandson. At that time, even if I am serving in the military away from home, someone will comfort my father. I won't have to feel like I'm constantly letting my father down, like I do now. The more he thought, the more excited he became, and the more excited he became, the more he wanted to think. He also realized a bit that if he kept thinking like this, when would it end? It wouldn't stop until dawn! If he really thought until dawn, then of course he wouldn't have any energy when he woke up tomorrow. A soldier's top priority is to be energetic. If tomorrow is inspection day, and I'm not energetic, then how can I cope with this difficult situation? I should quickly rest and conserve my energy. After I have restored my energy and overcome this difficulty, then I can proceed with the marriage in peace, that won't be too late. Tonight, the first task is still sleep, I can't think about anything else. So, he suppressed the surging thoughts in his mind and resolved to sleep. (138) The Slanting Bridge on a Summer Night Tiger Head</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally a paradise. Probably those who have never been to Shanghai, or those who long to come to Shanghai, have this idea. Looking at the Bund, gold and paper intoxicate the senses, it is naturally a paradise on earth, making people imagine "This place is so enjoyable, I don't want to go back to Shu." Especially at night, in the tall Western-style buildings, the electric lights are bright, and the music is enchanting. Pairs of men and women embrace each other, how pleasant, almost forgetting the hot summer. If you take a patrol to the Nanshi Slanting Bridge when you have nothing to do at night, you might suspect you have entered the gates of hell, completely contrary to the ideal paradise. Because the residents here are mostly middle-class or lower, a one- or two-story house has to accommodate six or seven families. It goes without saying that the front and back buildings and the attic are full of people... Even the kitchen lean-to and the back of the living room are full. Therefore, a house always has to let out twenty or so people. Imagine... A cage-like house, accommodating so many people, how can they sleep when it's too hot to bear? Therefore, the clever men and women have to spread broken mats on the cement to make temporary open-air beds. This open-air bed is neither as hot as a steamer nor do bedbugs and mosquitoes disturb one's dreams, making one happy and content. Then, when one person starts the trend, everyone follows. Every evening, the cement floor is already crowded with people. Although it's not yet time to sleep, they come early to reserve a spot, afraid of being beaten to the punch! Sometimes, there is a lot of bickering because of arriving late to reserve a spot. This is completely the world of coolies. They seek coolness in the summer, but when they settle the accounts in the autumn, it's mostly the coolies who suffer. A certain doctor said... "Our business is only best in the autumn." "Shanghai was originally a paradise," this statement, seen from here, becomes somewhat inaccurate... But there are still many people who desperately want to come to Shanghai. After a Hot Summer Afternoon Hu Xiaomi</p>
<p>The weather is extraordinarily hot, baring one's torso and vigorously waving a palm-leaf fan, beads of sweat like yellow beans still keep popping out.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, everything is quiet, and the stuffy weather makes people doze off.</p>
<p>The sky is as green and oily as the sea, far and high, as if it's boundless. There is not a hint of wind, and the tree branches stand straight and still. The sun scorches like fierce fire. Even at a distance of twenty or thirty feet, you can feel the heat radiating out.</p>
<p>The paulownia trees in the front yard grow tall and dense, blocking the sunlight, making the scene even more secluded and lovely. An old yellow dog lies in the shade of the tree, stretching out its tongue and panting heavily with its mouth wide open.</p>
<p>Outside the shade of the tree, on the scattered pieces of watermelon rind in the sunlight, many flies gather, buzzing and flying up for a while, then buzzing and settling down again, seemingly loving something delicious, wanting to give it up but unwilling to part with it.</p>
<p>From outside the wall comes the sound of "Sour plum soup" being hawked, with the long, drawn-out sound interspersed with the small gongs of candy sellers.</p>
<p>Other than that, everything is silent. Small Recipe Corn Yiqiu</p>
<p>"Corn," commonly known as "pearl rice" in Shanghai, "imperial rice" in the Suzhou-Yu area, and "corn" or "baogu" in the north, is an annual plant that blooms in late spring and bears fruit in summer. The fruit comes in yellow, white, red, and other colors, with both glutinous and non-glutinous varieties. It tastes sweet and fragrant, with those produced in my native Suzhou being the best. Recently, it has been appearing on the market, but most people see it as just a snack. As far as I know, it can be made into dishes and snacks, each with its own unique flavor. As "corn" comes into season, I am writing down the methods of preparation as follows to inform those who do not know.</p>
<p>Making Dishes</p>
<p>I have tried two ways of making dishes with corn... (1) Take a certain amount of fresh corn (preferably the non-glutinous type), shave off the kernels, and stir-fry them with "Beijing Dongcai" (available in southern goods stores). The taste is especially delicious. The stir-frying method is extremely simple: first, pour the shaved kernels into a pot of boiling oil, stir-fry for about half a minute, add a little soy sauce, salt, and sugar, then add the Beijing Dongcai, and add a small cup of water. The total time in the pot should be three minutes. However, there are two points to note: first, you must use high heat for stir-frying; second, the corn you use must be tender and fresh. (2) Take a whole chicken, remove the internal organs, choose half a pound of glutinous and fresh corn kernels, slowly fill the chicken's cavity, add one mace of salt, gently mix, use kelp (sold in southern goods stores) to tightly bind the chicken's body, place it in a pot of boiling water, add a spoonful of Shaoxing wine, and cook over high heat for about an hour. Then add a little salt to the soup, tightly seal the pot with wet paper, switch to charcoal embers, and simmer over low heat for about three or four hours, then it's done. The chicken meat, soup, and corn all have unique flavors. This method is available in restaurants around Tianjin and Beijing, called "Corn Chicken."</p>
<p>Making Snacks</p>
<p>The "Wo Wo Tou" that northerners love to eat is made from corn; however, southerners generally don't like the taste because of the poor preparation method. My mother grew up in Beijing and is skilled in the art of eating. After moving to Suzhou, she often made "Wo Wo Tou" as gifts for Suzhou relatives and friends, and they were greatly praised. The method has been reformed and is quite suitable for the taste of southerners. The method is as follows: Prepare the materials in advance... Sun-dried corn kernels (available at grain stores; buy them back and grind them into a fine powder), brown sugar, pine nuts, raw lard (cut into dice-sized pieces), and cold boiled water. For example, if you use three liters of corn flour, add one liter of cold boiled water and half a catty of brown sugar, stir well, and knead frequently by hand (the consistency should be the same as fresh wonton skin). Add the diced lard and pine nuts, each one or two hundred grains (the amount is not fixed), mix well, knead into the shape of a Shandong steamed bun, and dig a concave hole underneath, shaped like a stone mortar. Place it in a steamer and steam for about an hour, and it's done. The taste is very delicious, especially for those who like sweet food. Sour Plum Soup Especially</p>
<p>In the flourishing summer cities, fresh orange juice, ice cream, and soda water have become essential fine products, or rather, tonics. Among them, sour plum soup is the most common. Perhaps to compete (or to show authenticity), all vendors of sour plum soup must add the words "Beijing," as if without it, they would not be popular. Thus, big names like Zheng Fuzhai, and smaller ones like XX Ji or XX Zhai, are scattered throughout the cities to comfort those who are running around, thirsty and hot. Mentioning sour plum soup brings to mind something from childhood: I really enjoyed listening to others tell stories, especially those about battles in ancient times. Thus, on one occasion, I heard a story about Cao Cao's military campaign in the Three Kingdoms period, and I was naturally fascinated. He (the storyteller) said that once, Cao Cao sent troops to fight Liu Bei. On the way, there was no water to drink, and the soldiers were very thirsty, causing a great uproar. The generals also felt the same pain and found it difficult to cope, so they reported the situation to Cao Cao. Cao Cao then rode his horse forward and shouted loudly, "Are you all thirsty? Then hurry onward! There are many plum orchards ahead, enough to quench your thirst!" The soldiers heard this, their mouths watering, and they no longer felt thirsty. Although this is just a short story, we can imagine the status of "plums" at the time, and the ingenuity of improvising in ancient warfare. Now, "Beijing Sour Plum Soup" has been fully launched on the market, and drinkers are drinking it like cattle. Fortunately, the "Beijing" that is used as a slogan is still safely preserved. Now that the ceasefire has been realized, I wonder if the Northeast can still enjoy sipping as before, and whether the aftertaste of drinking is sweet or sour?</p>

<p>High School Examination Pass Certificates Issued to Students Who Passed All Subjects</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education announced yesterday that, after reviewing the high school graduation examination for this year, there are some students who have passed eight or six subjects and have one or three subjects that have not been examined. According to the Ministry of Education's Order No. 6559, the method for taking makeup exams and continuing education is to first apply to public and private universities, colleges, or specialized schools in this city with a certificate issued by this bureau. However, after being admitted, they must still request a makeup exam from this bureau. Only those who pass the makeup exam will be allowed to attend classes. Those who fail will have their admission qualifications revoked. Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Education's Order No. 6558, "Those who wish to apply to public and private specialized schools above the specialized school level outside of Shanghai should clearly fill in their applications when receiving the certificate and submit them to the bureau for review and notification." This bureau has decided to issue the aforementioned certificates from today until January 10th. The students may have their school, parents, or themselves fill in the admission ticket number, the school they are applying to, and submit a 2.5-inch photo to the bureau to apply for the certificate in order to apply for specialized schools and above in advance. After the bureau decides on the date of the makeup exam, they will follow the instructions and take the exam. It is hereby announced for your information. The Path That Chinese Elementary School Education Should Follow in the Future</p>
<p>Director Pan's Speech at the Summer School Memorial Week</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education's Third Summer School held a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Director Pan Gongzhan presided over the meeting. After Director Pan led the lecturers, staff, and students in paying respects, he continued to speak about the path that Chinese elementary school education should follow in the future. He stated that the purpose of Chinese education is based on the Three Principles of the People, but the methods and training paths for guiding students in primary and secondary schools and universities should each have special points of emphasis. Secondary schools and universities will not be discussed in detail. Regarding elementary schools, the acquisition of knowledge by children should value personal activities and experiences. Neglecting the dynamic knowledge of society and life and blindly regarding textbooks as the main base of learning materials is a major shortcoming of Chinese education in the past. Those engaged in elementary school education in the future should understand that children's innate organs, such as ears, eyes, mouth, nose, etc., are all tools for children to seek knowledge. Instead of emphasizing the instillation of dead knowledge, it is better to sharpen children's various knowledge-seeking tools so that they can benefit endlessly. Finally, he said that the training path for elementary school children should focus on memory, music, and drawing. Children have a better attitude towards learning than adults, so they can easily memorize the content of learning materials. Teachers can make full use of the characteristics of children's memory to guide them to memorize the minimum amount of knowledge, while using music to harmonize their temperament and promote their national spirit, and using drawing to cultivate their ability to appreciate and observe real objects. Drawing and music are favored by children, and we should inspire children's psychological preferences and pay attention to guidance, while memorizing relevant materials, in order to cultivate the foundation of the Three Principles of the People's education. During Director Pan's speech, all the students listened attentively and quietly, and the order was orderly, which is enough to know the spirit of the bureau's summer school. The Former Middle School Joint Association Ends</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association had already resolved to end, and the details of its end have been reported in various newspapers, and the accounts have also been audited and published. However, the documents and equipment taken away by the Public Security Bureau have not been recovered, which has affected the inability to end some accounts. It is now learned that the person in charge of the end of the association feels that this protracted delay is not a good plan. In order to expedite the clearing of the procedures, it has been decided to entrust the Middle School Students' United Association to handle the unfinished matters. The remaining funds of the association, excluding expenses such as printing the Middle School Joint Association's special issue and advertising expenses, which are still undetermined at 60 yuan, have been transferred from the association's deposit account at the Shanghai Municipal Bank. The remaining 4,240 yuan and 5 jiao in the Shanghai Municipal Bank's deposit account have been fully transferred to the Middle School Students' United Association by Xiao Sizhi, the person in charge of the end of the association. At this point, the association has completely ended. The association is afraid that the representatives of the various schools have unclear matters that need to be inquired, and has specially stipulated that before 10:00 am on the 27th of this month, they can go to Yi Chenjun at the Far East News Agency on Luban Road to transfer to Xiao Sizhi. Overdue, they will not be responsible in order to clear the procedures. The University Teachers' Association Convened an Extraordinary Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</p>

<p>Today's Registration Time is Extended to 4:00 PM</p>
<p>National Jinan University began accepting new students for this year yesterday. In the past two days, the number of applicants to the school has been extremely enthusiastic, especially those who wish to enter the Colleges of Science and Business. The change in the aspirations of young people, focusing on science and construction, is a good phenomenon. After the merger of the Colleges of Law and Education, the school has exerted its full strength to expand the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, and Business. The College of Science has added more than 40,000 yuan of new instruments and specimens after the war. The equipment is quite new and complete. From the next semester, the curriculum will be revised, and experimentation and lectures will be equally emphasized. The College of Business has been established for the longest time, with more than ten years of history. Recently, the College of Business has established five departments. In addition to actively innovating the curriculum to meet the needs of international affairs, it has also made arrangements with major banks, companies, and factories in Shanghai to send students from the college to the banks, companies, and factories for practical exercises on a regular basis in order to train business talents who can adapt to domestic and foreign business wars. The College of Liberal Arts is also implementing a newly revised curriculum, not only paying attention to the cultivation of intelligence and the guidance of thought, but also emphasizing basic training to cultivate the foundation for academic research. Therefore, special attention is paid to Chinese, English, Japanese, French, German, and other languages. Recently, due to the economic depression in various overseas regions, many overseas Chinese parents feel economic difficulties, which has prevented their children from returning home to study. The school has specifically formulated preferential measures for overseas Chinese students, which have been reported in previous newspapers. President Zheng has telegraphed the preferential measures to overseas consulates, requesting that they be forwarded to overseas Chinese in various regions. Recently, the school has received telegrams from overseas requesting an extension of the deadline for the overseas Chinese student entrance examination to facilitate their return to the country for the examination. It is reported that the school has agreed to extend the deadline to before August 25. In addition, the school has been receiving too many applicants recently. For the convenience of the new students who are coming to the school to register this time, today's registration time has been extended to 4:00 PM. Recent News on Enrollment at Pudong Middle School</p>
<p>Since the new principal, Dr. Xu Zhi, took office at Pudong Middle School, he has been working hard to organize and improve school affairs, so the work is very tense. The school convened a meeting of the enrollment committee at the Chinese Science Society on Albert Road the other day, and many important cases were resolved. It is reported that, in order to facilitate students' applications, the examination sites will be divided into three locations: the Fudan Shizhong on Kang Nao Road, the second part of the school's junior high school on Duojia Road in Nanshi, and the main campus of the school on Liuli Bridge. All applicants from various places can choose one of the sites to take the exam nearby. Male and female students from distant places who feel that accommodation is inconvenient can contact the director of the reception office, Zhang Shuqin, for accommodation. Accommodation fees are waived, and meals can also be arranged. The Physical Education Association Invites Participation in the Rotary Cup Competition</p>

<p>Film Special: The German Film Industry Under Hitler's Rule (Part 2) by Huang Junru</p>
<p>"Germany Awakens" was also a propaganda film for the Nazi party system and premiered on April 20th, Hitler's birthday. This film also had a subtitle called "Record of German National Regeneration" and, like "Bleeding Germany," contained a large number of speeches by Nazi brownshirts.</p>
<p>In addition, private film companies also catered to the wishes of the Nazi Party, producing a large number of fascist films, such as "Rhine Pathos" and other new patriotic war films. The famous director Seretti and Norman jointly announced that they would produce the national essence film "Supreme Germany." This film is expected to be divided into two parts, one called "Dance of Death" and the other "Paving the Way," using historical events from 1918 to 1933, the eve of the Nazi Party's seizure of power, as dramatic material. Goebbels has already approved of this and promised to provide strong support. Also, "Under the Black Assault Flag," which was recently shown at the Kabitel Theater, depicts farmers in East Prussia. No professional actors were used during its filming, and the roles were selected only from farmers. It takes as its theme the gradual abandonment of feudal traditions since the Middle Ages by the rural villages, weakened by the capitalist invasion after the European war and nearing starvation, and their awakening to stand under the fascist banner. The ending features a speech by Nazi leader Hitler, showing that this is a completely Nazi propaganda film.</p>
<p>The Hitler government is very strict with film censorship. Not only are films incompatible with the Nazi Party's claims forbidden from being shown, but the business rights of Jewish film operators are also exploited, resulting in a severe blow to the American film import industry. Among the films banned from being shown, American and Russian films are generally the most numerous, followed by French and British films. Italian films are very popular, which is due to the cooperation between Germany and Italy and the fact that both countries are fascist.</p>
<p>The above is a general picture of the German film industry under Hitler's iron-fisted rule. But what will the future trend be? If the Hitler government does not fall, there is no doubt that the entire German film industry will become fascist. This can be seen from the following facts: The "German Film Artists Protection Association," which encompasses all German film artists, not only merged with the Nazi Party's cultural and political organs and became a shock force for the Nazi Party's cultural movement, but also was initially controlled by the "German Culture Combat League," the mastermind behind the exclusion of Jews, and later automatically dissolved its organization (May 8) and joined the "German Culture Combat League" and the "National Party Operating Cell Organization." From then on, German film artists and technicians lost their independent position and organization and became members of the Nazi Party. Therefore, the German film industry will inevitably be painted with the colors of Hitlerism, and the films produced will undoubtedly be Nazi propaganda. (The End)</p>
<p>Viewer Opinions: Talking about "Two Seconds" by Mihu</p>
<p>European and American movies generally can't escape the story of male and female entanglements, so the romance theme in this "Two Seconds" is not worth paying attention to. However, the author of "Two Seconds" seems to be standing on a position of slight revulsion towards the current "American-style" male and female entanglements, so he consecutively used things like forced marriage after drunkenness, and frivolous beatings and frivolous repentance, to show how hasty and irresponsible modern men and women are towards marriage.</p>
<p>Secondly, the producer is very clear about the greatness of the power of money, so he not only writes that Shirley still associates with the dance hall manager Turner even after marrying John, but he also writes that after John gets sick, John's wife borrows money from Turner, the person John hates the most. Although they were lucky enough to win the lottery and pay off their debts, Shirley was still beaten to death, and "the forensic doctor did not allow the criminal to defend himself and carried out the death penalty according to the院长's order." This passage gives no small amount of satire to the current law.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspect, I must first introduce the flashback method in this film. The death row inmate John repents for two seconds in the electric chair, and the entire story unfolds in John's memory. Flashbacks, or recall methods, are common in movies. However, whether it is possible to recall such detail in the short time of two seconds, no one really knows.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The film "Two Seconds" was shown at the Cathay Theater more than two months ago. This is the second time it has been re-screened at the Carlton, so there is no need to comment on it again. However, the points raised by Mr. Mihu are insightful, so I have presented them specifically. As for recalling so many things in two seconds, I think it's impossible. I think "a sudden impulse, a moment of sadness" is the most that could happen. But I dare not be too assertive, or perhaps when sitting in the electric chair, thoughts turn faster, that is also unknown.</p>
<p>Not Clever: A Tit for Tat by Xifu</p>
<p>John Barrymore is a big star from a family of performers. Because he is a big star, he is very proud. Because he is so proud, he is inevitably a bit arrogant. Many movie fans who admire stars like to ask the stars to sign their names, just like people in our country ask for calligraphy from great men and teachers. But when they meet John Barrymore, they are rejected by him. So many people are afraid to take liberties because Barrymore is so arrogant. But not long ago, a great thinker, playwright, writer, and barbarian head came to Hollywood. He is none other than the famous George Bernard Shaw. This time, it was something! John Barrymore hosted a banquet to welcome Shaw. These two big brains in the theater and film industry, although the host and guests were friendly and harmonious, couldn't help but have a sense of testing each other in their hearts when heroes meet. John Barrymore first took a book and said to the old man Shaw, "This is my son's book, please sign it so that the child's wishes may be fulfilled." Old man Shaw smiled and patted Barrymore on the shoulder, saying, "If this book were your grandfather's, I would sign it for him." When this news spread, everyone who had always felt that John Barrymore was arrogant applauded and cheered, because old man Shaw had avenged them.</p>
<p>One Type of Star's Pastime by Fu</p>
<p>Some Can Use It, Some Can't</p>
<p>Gloria Swanson recently invented a pastime. When she has nothing to do, she picks up the telephone and makes calls for fun. She has no purpose in making calls. She randomly picks a number in the telephone book and dials it. Her intention is to tell the person who answers the phone that she is Gloria Swanson, and listen to the other person's surprised voice: "Oh!" Then she chats casually for a while to kill time. The people who answer the phone are also very happy, and many people hope to have this good fortune one day, to receive a call from Swanson.</p>
<p>Later, Little Fairbanks heard about this pastime, and he also imitated it. One day, when he had nothing to do, he picked up the phone and started making calls in his bedroom. The person who answered the phone was a little girl. Little Fairbanks thought, great, it's also good to talk to a child. So he told her that he was Little Fairbanks. He waited for a while, but there was no reply on the other end. He said again, "I am Little Fairbanks, did you hear me?" From then on, Little Fairbanks never dared to make phone calls for fun again.</p>
<p>Many Stars Go to Europe by Fu</p>
<p>Babe Daniels has already gone to Europe. She wants to make a film in London, England. Sally Eilers also went with her. She didn't have any purpose in going, but was just accompanying Babe Daniels for fun. Later, after they arrived in England, the British Gaumont Company also hired Sally Eilers, so now Sally is also making films in England. Pascal recently took a ship to Europe. He will also be making films in England soon, and his wife will also be going to England soon. Now Hollywood is also rumored that Maurice Chevalier will be going to Europe soon. He wants to return to France by ship after his contract with Paramount expires. He wants to shoot a musical film himself in France.</p>
<p>Garbo's Old Temper Hasn't Changed by Fu</p>
<p>People say that Greta Garbo's temper has changed since she returned to Hollywood from Europe, and she is not as eccentric as before. But that's wrong, her temper hasn't changed at all. On her first day in America, she would talk and laugh, and she would stand and let reporters take pictures. She also said a few words to greet the reporters gathered at the dock. But since she got in the car and returned to Hollywood, she has returned to her old temper. She now, except for work, does not meet with reporters, does not allow people to take pictures, and is as eccentric as before. She is now asking the company to call Ronald Colman back to be her supporting actor, but Colman is now in Europe and probably won't be able to return for a while.</p>
<p>The Dark World of Hollywood by Bing</p>
<p>A type of bathroom is now popular in Hollywood, and many stars are imitating it in their homes. The interior of this type of bathroom is completely black. The walls are made of black mica stone, the bathtub is made of black porcelain, the chairs are also black, the floor is also black, the washbasin is even more black, even the soap is black, and the towels are also black. Even the bathrobe must be black. In short, everything is black. Many stars have specially hired black people dressed in black clothes, black shoes, and black socks to manage this black bathroom.</p>
<p>When Greta Garbo was in Europe, she heard that Hollywood had discovered the dark world and found it very interesting. She said to her friends, "Everything is black in the bathroom, but it would be best if the water was also black, then after bathing in the dark bathroom with black water, everyone could become black people."</p>

<p>Following the Thousand-Faced Man Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, who sacrificed himself for art, has risen to fame since playing in "Frankenstein." Recently, after Boris played in "The Mummy," he was deeply praised by the British film industry, and Gaumont Company hired him.</p>
<p>Charles Laughton left for Europe immediately after playing in Paramount's "The Private Life of Henry VIII" because he had no contractual constraints. He is now in London, dressed in the clothes of King Henry VIII in the 1570s. He goes to Hampton Court Palace to play every day. He is a descendant of the British royal family, so he can enter and exit the palace. He is now in London, and may join the Gaumont Company. Gaumont Company has sent people to contact him.</p>
<p>Samuel Goldwyn and his wife, the bosses of MGM, have now arrived in London. Samuel Goldwyn is now the world's leading film magnate. The British film industry also admires Goldwyn's methods of reforming the film industry. This time, Samuel Goldwyn and his wife arrived in London. The London film industry held a grand welcome party for them, and many Londoners participated in the welcome, which was quite grand for a while.</p>
<p>Tour of European and American Film Studios (6) by Yun Yan</p>
<p>The Universal City employs a total of 1,000 people. There is a zoo inside with lions, elephants, tigers, leopards, and everything else. There is also a chicken farm with about thousands of chickens. There are stables inside with many horses. When Western films (i.e., martial arts films) were popular, many cowboys also lived in the studio. There is also an entertainment hall for employees with very good facilities. There is a large restaurant where people from outside can also eat.</p>
<p>Before 1915, Universal Pictures was filming in a very small studio. This studio was in the middle of Gower and Baily Wood, and it has long been burned down. At that time, Carl Laemmle, seeing that the film business would definitely develop in the future, began to build today's large studio. After it was completed, more than 45,000 people sat on special buses to see this strange place. Even Edison and Henry Ford drove their cars there to visit.</p>
<p>Universal Studio, in the era of silent films, was of course very powerful. A group of the earliest big stars, such as May Murray and Lon Chaney, were famous in Universal. Since the popularity of sound films, it has also grown rapidly and entered a new front.</p>
<p>All the equipment and machinery in the studio have been replaced with the latest models.</p>
<p>(British) Beaconsfield Film Studio</p>
<p>The British Lion Film Corporation Studio in Buckinghamshire, England</p>
<p>Beaconsfield is located in Buckinghamshire. It is a completely British town. The town has a wide crossroads. The houses at the head of the street are still lifeless at noon, as if they are sleeping there. Only after the British Lion Film Corporation was established did the town gradually become lively. Now, the mothers of Beaconsfield will also bring their babies to the studio to act as extras. The children of Beaconsfield will also go to see how those movie stars work.</p>
<p>This studio is hidden under a very high roof. Its bottom layer has a large area. On the side of this large building, there is a row of bungalows that are the workshops for plasterers and carpenters. On the other side, there is a film projection room, office, and a row of places to store films. The entire studio is located on a large lawn, surrounded by very high walls. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Assassination of Prime Minister Inukai</p>
<h3 id="e165">Military Court Opens Trial <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, 24th, Tokyo Telegraph - The Japanese Navy opened a military court at the Yokosuka Naval Base at 9:00 AM this morning to try the ten assassins, including Lieutenant Commander Koga, in the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai. The court will convene every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with thirty sessions scheduled to complete the trial. The number of spectators is limited to thirty. After the court opens, a ban on public attendance will be announced. The army assassins are scheduled to be tried in a military court in Tokyo tomorrow, with the trial expected to conclude in twelve days.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, 24th, Tokyo Telegraph - The naval assassins in the May 15th assassination of Prime Minister Inukai case in Japan were tried in a military court this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Heavy Guard Along the Way - The eleven naval assassins awaiting trial departed from the Otsu Prison at 8:00 AM this morning, traveling in three cars to the Kusunoura Military Court. A truck carrying ten armed police officers led the way in front of the three cars. Behind them, two more trucks, each carrying twelve police officers, followed. Police Inspector Nagareishi and Police Inspector Koiso led fifty-three police officers to guard both sides of the road. Military Police Sergeant Major Tazuke led seven military police officers, and Warden Murakami led six wardens, accompanying the assassins. They arrived at the court at 8:15 AM. Lieutenant Commander Tsukano sat on the right, and the others were seated according to their military rank, awaiting the start of the trial. All the assassins wore white naval service uniforms.</p>
<p>Defendants Tried Separately - The May 15th case involved assassins from the army, navy, and civilian sectors. The trials are being conducted separately. The navy defendants, considered the masterminds, are being tried first. The testimonies of the assassins are drawing significant attention from all sides. The judges for the naval military court are: Presiding Judge, Navy Captain Takasu Shiro; Judges, Navy Lieutenant Commander Owada Noboru, Lieutenant Kihara Yoshitane, and Lieutenant Fujio Katsuo. The legal officers for this case are Takarai Osamu (legal counsel) and Shiosui Shigetoshi (prosecutor). This is the complete list of those conducting the trial. There are eleven assassins in total, charged with three different types of crimes. Those charged with the crime of rebellion are Navy Lieutenant Commander Koga Kiyoshi, Nakamura Yoshio, Mikami Taku, Yamagishi Hiroshi, Navy Reserve Ensign Kuroiwa Isamu, and Ensign Murakami Kakunosuke. Those charged with the crime of preparing for rebellion are Navy Lieutenant Commander Tsukano Michio,</p>
<p>Lieutenant Hayashi Masayoshi, Ensign Ito Kameki, and Oba Haruo, a total of eleven people. The five lawyers are Kiyose Ichiro, Doctor of Laws and Secretary-General of the National Alliance, Fukuda Kurabunji, Hayashi Itsuro, Navy Lieutenant Asada, and Navy Lieutenant Shimizu.</p>
<p>Reading of the Charges Against the Accused - Before the assassins entered the courtroom, the spectator seats were already full. News reporters and families of the assassins were present. In the special spectator seats, Commander Nomura, Chief of Staff Hamada, Director of the Eda Naval Air Arsenal, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Navy Ministry Terashima, Director of the Education Bureau Goto, Director of the Legal Affairs Bureau Yamada, and Director of the Murata Naval Arsenal, totaling about twenty people, sat behind the judges. The lawyers sat on both sides of the assassins. At 9:25 AM, Presiding Judge Takasu announced the opening of the court. The prosecutor read the charges against each defendant as follows: "The defendants were influenced and guided by the late Navy Lieutenant Commander Fujii Hitoshi. Lieutenant Commander Fujii, while at the Naval Academy, advocated Pan-Asianism, seeking to unite the Asian nations with Japan as their leader, in order to punish the violence of the white races and spread morality to the world. Defendants Koga Kiyoshi and Murayama Kakunosuke, under his leadership, worked to gather comrades, instigating defendants Ito Kameki and Hayashi Masayoshi to convene a meeting of a dozen people, including Murayama, Ito, and Oba, in the Dansui Pavilion in Tsuchiura Town in July of Showa 5 (1930) to discuss organizing a direct action group. In February of the same year, they gathered more than a dozen people, including Mikami, Koga, and Murayama, at the Kashi Hot Springs in Fukuoka Prefecture to hold a meeting to discuss organizing a group to reform national politics through direct action. After Lieutenant Commander Fujii died in battle in Shanghai, the defendants did not change their original intentions. Koga Kiyoshi and Nakamura Yoshio, as leaders, continued his goals, disturbing the peace of the imperial capital through collective direct action, intending to create a state of martial law, and under martial law, to seek the reform of the nation. Therefore, the public prosecution is brought against each defendant on the aforementioned charges."</p>
<h3 id="e166">Lieutenant Commander Koga's Testimony <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, 24th</p>
<p>Tokyo Telegraph - In the military court today, Lieutenant Commander Koga replied to Presiding Judge Takasu, stating, "My motivation for participating in the May 15th Incident was that while studying at the Naval Academy, I was moved by Lieutenant Commander Fujii's Pan-Asianism. Later, I became acquainted with Inoue Nissho. In Taisho 14, I was introduced by Fujii, and Dr. Okawa became our teacher and comrade. Inoue Nissho is the central figure in this case. Both the army and navy were guided by him. As for Gondo Seikyo, he was not our comrade, but he showed great sympathy for our movement. The assassination of Lieutenant Commander Nishida was due to suspicion that he had betrayed us. I was greatly guided in my thinking by Fujii, but during my time at the Naval Academy, I was also greatly inspired by Toyama Mitsuru's instructions from Saigo Takamori, which stated, 'Only those who do not fear death or fame can accomplish great things.' The 'Chankanjo' (petition for justice) regarding the assassination of Asahi of the Yasuda Zaibatsu also greatly stimulated my thinking. Regarding the London Naval Treaty, Japanese representative Zaibu was the son-in-law of Yamamoto, the Satsuma clique admiral, and colluded with the zaibatsu, forgetting the navy's position and blindly following Wakatsuki Reijiro. Although he was a naval officer, he had very little support within the navy. The purpose of the meetings in May of Showa 5 and spring of Showa 6 was to plan the reformation of national politics. The matters discussed at that time were telegraphed to Lieutenant Commander Fujii, who expressed opposition. The method agreed upon at the time was to adopt the principle of 'kill one to save one' and a plan to attack the Shinbunsha (newspaper company). The process was the same as described in the investigation. I wish to state the truth of the ○○ incident to clarify this case." Presiding Judge Takasu stated that this case would disrupt peace and order and therefore prohibited spectators. At 2:00 PM, the secret trial resumed. Lieutenant Commander Koga detailed the truth. The so-called ○○ incident is rumored to be the Nishiki-e Revolution Incident of mid-October of Showa 6. This case will continue tomorrow."</p>

<p>Kokumin, 23rd, Berlin Telegraph - German Navy Admiral Schroeder, famous as "The Lion of Flanders," died in Berlin today at the age of seventy-nine. During the European War, Schroeder commanded the naval base in northern Belgium and guarded the German army's right flank, which controlled the English Channel. Schroeder planned to attack the British coast with submarines and bomb London from the sky.</p>

<p>丨The Great Assassination Plan of the Divine Soldiers Was Not Implemented丨</p>
<p>On the surface, domestic Japan, since the incident on May 15th last year when active-duty officers of the army and navy brazenly shot and killed Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in broad daylight, and after the military and government cooperated to appease the situation, the unrest has not continued to escalate. The actions of the left wing are naturally subject to severe suppression by the law and the police under the guidance of the law. There is only underground activity, and daily struggles are only slightly expressed in the economic and cultural aspects. However, the various right-wing groups are very different. They have considerable middle-class capitalists as financial backers and the army and navy as political supporters. Therefore, even if the government intends to limit their activities, its power cannot reach the military. Therefore, the activities of right-wing groups are still very vigorous and powerful. Although, strictly speaking, their actions are illegal, their movement has the tacit consent of the military and receives direct assistance from veterans' associations. Even many active-duty officers join, turning around and providing them with weapons. Therefore, the right-wing movement displayed a very strange power last year. The head of the financial cliques, Tadanuma Takuma, the key figure of the political parties, Inoue Junnosuke, and the current Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi were all assassinated one after another. This shows that the rise of the right-wing movement is not necessarily for the benefit of the Japanese rulers.</p>
<p>Moreover, although most of Japan's right-wing groups call themselves "Japanese Spirit," their starting point is always dissatisfaction with the current situation in Japan. They express extreme anger at the general situation in Japan, both politically and economically. In particular, after Japan invaded Manchuria, the general suffering of the Japanese people, the suffering of life, the suffering of unemployment, and the stagnation of the rural economy have not improved compared with before the September 18th Incident. The quasi-wartime military expenses are added to the general public in the name of public bonds. As a result, the people's resentment is deepening, and the lurking crisis is growing. The movement of right-wing groups is trending towards radicalism, using the guise of legality to implement terrorist policies against political authorities, supporters of parliamentary politics, and financial cliques.</p>
<p>Therefore, an extremely uneasy sense of terror has arisen in major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. In particular, those responsible officials (except for military officers), financial cliques, and political party leaders are all on high alert, fearing that disaster will strike.</p>
<p>The Great Japan Production Party is a group of extreme elements in the right-wing groups. Their actions are extremely激越. They take direct action against the current government. In order to maintain secrecy, they do not hold cadre meetings in advance, nor do they adopt a collegiate system. They only gather a small number of cadres to plan their work. They maintain absolute secrecy about all future plans, and they do not easily let outsiders know even about the work they have implemented. Unexpectedly, their plans were uncovered by the police authorities.</p>
<p>Under the command of the Production Party, there is an organization called the Divine Soldiers. This Divine Soldier is the vanguard of the extreme elements. Their only method is "one person assassinating one person." This time, Suzuki Zen'ichi, the Minister of the Youth Party of the Production Party, suddenly issued an emergency call and gathered at the "Jingu Kōkaikan" of the "Meiji Jingu" at 12:00 PM on the 10th of this month to secretly plot an uprising. When the police saw this group of people, they immediately reported it to the Superintendent General of Police. Then the "Harajuku Police Station" ordered the police to be mobilized and arrested all the participants, totaling</p>
<p>eleven people. Only then did they learn about their plan, which was to first attack a certain gunpowder shop in Tokyo at 11:00 AM on July 11th to obtain pistols, bombs, and other weapons, and then divide into three teams. The first team leader was Maeda Miyao, and the chief of staff was Suzuki Zen'ichi. The goal was to attack the Prime Minister's residence, assassinate Prime Minister Saito Makoto, and then assassinate the ministers of the various departments. The second team was led by Uchimura Oka Kiyozō, and the goal was to surround the police and various police stations to incapacitate the police, so that Tokyo would immediately fall into a state of anarchy. The third team, led by Kageyama Seiji, first destroyed the Seiyukai, Minseito, and Kokumin Domei clubs, and then assassinated Count Makino Nobuaki, Suzuki Kisaburo, President of the Seiyukai, Wakatsuki Reijiro, President of the Minseito, and other financial cliques. They were all preparing to eliminate them all at once, but they did not know that the plan was not confidential and was recognized eleven hours before. It was defeated nine hours</p>
<p>before, otherwise Tokyo would have suffered a very big mess again.</p>
<p>Currently, the case is still under investigation. However, those in charge of the army and navy have officially stated that the military has nothing to do with this and called on everyone to rest assured. The unprecedented big case has finally been temporarily resolved. (July 19th, Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e169">Communist Bandits Invade the Border of Jiangxi <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Near Xunwu</p>
<p>The Bandits Were Overwhelmed and Retreated in Two Directions</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - The Southern Route Suppression Army has been in contact with the communist bandits for several days. Government troops are using aircraft to bomb the bandit fortifications. According to reports, the pseudo-135th Army Corps in the bandit area is divided into central and northeastern Jiangxi. The pseudo-1st Army Corps is gathered south of Xingan, and the pseudo-35th Army Corps is concentrated in Yihuang. The number is said to be about 100,000 people, but in reality, each regiment has only eight or nine hundred people. Firearms account for about 60%, and the rest hold knives and spears to help and shout. The main force of the communist bandits closest to the defense zone of the Southern Route Army is the defense zone of the 1st Division of the 1st Army. The Lee Division is stationed between Ganzhou and Wan'an, close to Yongfeng and Xingan. The front line has been ordered to strictly defend against it. Therefore, the situation in the central part of the Southern Route Army has become tight recently. As for the right-wing line, the communist bandits are encroaching southward. Recently, a large number of bandit soldiers have been transferred from the pseudo-35th and 2 Army Corps to suddenly attack the vicinity of Xunwu and Anyuan. On the Xunwu side, the Ouyang Xin Department of the 22nd Regiment of the Southern Route Army was the first to make contact, and fierce battles occurred near Xunwu. Places have been lost and regained several times. The Zhang Meixin Division of the First Column and the Gui Army Wang Zanbin Department blocked the rear of the communist bandits from the vicinity of Anyuan. A part of the Independent First Division was transferred to block and suppress them. However, the climate in the Xunwu area has been hot recently, and many soldiers in the Southern Route Army are sick. The 7th Division in the area is currently setting up a temporary hospital in Dazhexu, and the 8th Division is also setting up a hospital in Sanbiaoxu to accommodate them. In the Sannan area, the Division and the Gui Army have recently been searching for communist bandits. After the great battle near Xunwu, traces of bandits were also found in places such as Chongshengxu. According to a telegram from the front line on the 15th, the red bandit pseudo-special agent company opened from Shashe on the 13th and haunted Shanglian, more than 20 miles east of Anyuan City, forcing the villagers to cut rice. The Wang Zanbin Division in the area immediately sent the Liu Battalion of the Zhou Hunyuan Regiment to search and suppress them on the morning of the 14th. At about 5:00 AM on the 15th, they came into contact with seventy or eighty communist bandits near Sunwu and fought fiercely for a while. The bandits began to flee to Sun Gao, Hou Gao Mountain. There are no traces of bandits in Shanglian, and the battalion has led the team back to defense. Also, a remnant of bandits near Xunwu was intercepted by the Zhang Meixin Division and retreated in two directions through the area of Banjianshan Chongshi: one retreated from Longbu, and the other entered Huichang from Gaopai. The 5th Air Squadron of the Southern Route Army in the East River has made contact with the aircraft squadron of the 19th Route Army of Fujian, and they are scheduled to bomb the bandit nests separately to assist the army's progress.

<p>＝Summer Grain Harvest Is Very Poor, and Autumn Crops Are Already Hopeless＝</p>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence - The disaster situation in Shaanxi Province has become more serious recently. The summer harvest is extremely poor, and the autumn harvest is still far away. Unexpectedly, recently, various counties have been hit by repeated wind, frost, and hail, and the autumn crops have been almost completely destroyed, making the scene even more tragic and forming a disaster again. The disaster situation in various counties is recorded together below.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Jingbian <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Jingbian has received two inches of rain since March 15th and has been dry for more than two months. The people are worried about drought again. Fortunately, it rained on June 1st and 2nd. The people replanted the seedlings that had been frosted and rolled by the wind. Unexpectedly, just as the seedlings were about to emerge from the soil, there were thunderstorms again on the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th of this month, causing flooding on the ground. The water depth on the flat ground was one foot, so the crops on the mountainside, beams, and other places were all flooded. There is still water that has not dried and soaked the soil. Even if the water recedes in a day or two, it will still not be possible to plant. Even if it can be planted, it will only be buckwheat.</p>

<p>In Yichuan, there was thunder and heavy rain on the afternoon of the 10th of this month, lasting for about a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>It stopped suddenly. The next day, villagers reported that there had been a severe hail disaster in the northeast of the first district. On the afternoon of the 11th, hail and rain fell intermittently for about a quarter of an hour. The large ones were the size of peaches, the small ones were the size of apricots, and some were as small as soybeans. The accumulation on the ground was an inch thick. The leaves of the trees were all fallen, and the damage to the crops can be imagined. According to statistics, there are more than 20 villages where the disaster was too severe. We have received letters from various districts reporting that there is a risk of hail, with the first district being the worst. In addition, the hail disaster in the third district is also very serious.</p>

<p>Heavy rains have been falling frequently here recently. At dawn on the 12th of this month, the rain continued to fall, and it only cleared at about 7:00 AM on the 13th. Around 12:00 PM, dark clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, lightning flashed, and heavy rain poured down. Low-lying areas suddenly became marshes. It only stopped slightly at about 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Also, in the vicinity of this town, there have been continuous torrential rains for days, mountain floods have erupted, and floods have mixed with the ditches, with water heads of more than 30 feet already. The crops in the ditches and the Water God Temple were all submerged. Farmers cried bitterly and complained incessantly, making people who saw them unable to hold back their tears.</p>

<p>Since the hail fell in this county a few days ago, the climate has been unsettled, with strong winds blowing, flying dust and flying dust, making it difficult for pedestrians to find their way, and even uprooting trees. The crops in the fields were almost completely destroyed. After the gale, heavy rain poured down, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled incessantly, falling harder and harder, like a downpour. By the 12th, the accumulated water was several feet deep. The general public was pessimistic about this gale and rain.</p>

<p>In more than ten villages, including Guanjia Guangou and Sunjia Zhua in the southern district of this county, a hurricane suddenly rose in the middle of this month, covering the sky and the earth, with sand and stones flying, making it impossible to see anything within a foot. Two days later, the wind stopped, but there was heavy rain again, with hail mixed in, as large as peaches and apricots, falling to the ground with a sound. The crops in the fields were all broken: the larger ones had their leaves cut and their stems broken, and the smaller ones were buried in the mud. The autumn and summer crops were all destroyed. The farmers in these villages suffered this strange disaster of wind and frost and complained incessantly.</p>

<p>Since May, there have been frequent gales and rainstorms here, and even hail mixed with snow. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 19th of this month, dark clouds covered the sky, the wind was very strong, and the thunder rumbled. In a moment, heavy rain poured down, with wind and hail mixed in, the large ones like eggs and peaches, the small ones like apricots and dates, lasting for dozens of minutes, with an accumulation of hail of an inch or so. The affected areas include more than 30 villages, including Beiyuan Village, Yuanze River, Dongjia Yuan, Yangjia, Majia River, Lijia Gegeng, Doujia River, Yangjia Gegeng, Louer River, Pangjia Yuan, Nanyuan Cunhe, Doujia Yuan, and Shihe Village, covering an area of over a hundred miles. Currently, the crops and trees in the fields have all withered, and the farmers are all desperate. The land is barren for thousands of miles, and the general farmers are all crying to the sky and grabbing the ground.</p>
