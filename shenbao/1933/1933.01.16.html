<p>英日成立妥恊國聯一味遷就日本</p>
<p>德魯蒙案完全漠視我國立塲</p>
<p>措辭優柔荏弱我國萬難接受</p>
<h3>十九國特委會今日重行召集</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會將於明日起、重復工作、各大國尤其英國、顯圖修改原决議草案、明示讓步、使日本樂於接受、現已電東京、徵求同意、料星期三覆電可到、星期四十九特委會、即提出討論、據此間一般觀察、國聯仍需要美國合作、否則一切决議、將成空談、縱中國接受調解、不類於屈服、但前途唯一之希望、仍在能否堅强抵抗云、（十五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）明日午後十九特委會集議時、主席希孟與國聯秘書長德魯蒙將提出休會期内與中日兩造談判進行情形之報告、當希孟回國應付閣潮時、該問題幾全由德魯蒙處理、希孟於星期五夜返抵日内瓦後、即與德魯蒙及中代表顏惠慶日代表松岡接談、故目下一切事實、皆已了然、國聯方面因德魯蒙製成折中方案之結果、已有較樂觀之空氣、雖日政府覆電在星期二日或星期三日之前、不致傳達日内瓦、但衆信日本可予贊成、或至少可使恊定之門户開啓、故料十九特委會明日必將延會兩三日、俾中日之覆電可在此兩三日内到達、聞日内閣將於下星期二日開會考慮該問題、至於中國之立塲殊欠明瞭、中政府是否將不經奮鬥而接受所商定之修正案、甚屬可疑、甚至如原來方式之决議草案、中國猶覺其太弱、故特提出修正文、切實聲明不承認、「滿洲國」、並日本違反條約、就中國眼光觀之、德魯蒙之折中方案、顯未顧及中國之修正文、而反請中國接受措詞荏弱之决議案、中國對此、已因其優柔而予反對矣、在此情態中、中國提出異議、殊不足驚訝、所難知者、中國是否將完全拒絶十九特委會全體業已同意之建議耳、雖中國於一九三一年十二月十日曾在巴黎贊成與今次修正案徵同之决議案、但中國之出此、實因該案中規定組織李頓調查圑之故、而目前之建議、除由小委員會之斡旋與日進行談判外、顯然未予中國絲毫利益也、但一經拒絶、責任孔巨、諒中國必三思而後出此也、明日會議有可注意之一點、即上年十二月間發起原决議案擁護公道之諸小國代表均不蒞塲是、西班牙代表瑪達里亞迦·愛爾蘭自由邦代表康諾立·捷克期拉夫代表皮尼士·瑞士代表摩太·均不出席、而將代以他人、英外相西門明晨可抵此間、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）現傳國聯秘書長德魯蒙、已將新决議案草稿送致中日代表徵求兩政府同意、其内容與十九國委員舊擬草案大相逕庭、旣無一字語及滿洲僞組織、亦未提及美國與蘇俄、僅暗示有邀請若干非會員國加入調解之可能性而已、據東京消息、似表示新决議案可爲日本所接受但此間一般人士咸懐疑其能否爲中國與國聯大會所滿意也、中國政府爲榆關事件致辛丑和約國之照會、今日已由顏惠慶代表在此間發表、國聨中人解釋此照會、謂足見中國决意盡力抵抗日本之侵犯熱河云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）松岡與希孟昨日下午四時半會見、希孟要求日本須承認特魯蒙之妥恊案、不然將使國聯陷於不可收拾混亂狀態、松岡說明日本拒絶美俄俄參加之原因、謂自從日俄戰役以後、美國積極圖買南滿鐵道、邇來美日兩國在東三省之競爭日趨激烈、中日紛爭如邀請美國參加、則美日之感情必愈趨不可自制、此次要求希孟諒解、下午五時五十分始辭退、（十五日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外部今日下午接到特魯蒙案之主席宣言文、即時召集部會議、聞日外部對該案竟認爲不滿意、决定再要求國聯修改、定十六日至十七日之中、發訓電令松岡回答特魯蒙、其修改要點如次、㈠宣言文中、關於尊重李頓報告書一節、則無異認『滿洲國』之組織、出諸日本之手創、此點應削除、㈡五國委員會職權、應限在促成中日直接交涉之範圍、不能當作解决中日紛爭之機關、㈢國聯尚未明確放棄邀請美俄之參加、希望堅决表示拒絶非聯盟國之參加調解中日紛爭、（十五日華聯電）</p>
<h3>日軍事當局公然表示侵熱計劃勢將擴至平津黑夜槍聲一發大戰即自此開始因碍於國際對外先作詭譎宣傳</h3>
<p>（東京）日本軍事當局現公然承認如熱河問題不能和平解决、則遲早間必採用積極軍事行動、俾使熱河處於「滿洲國」政府完全管轄之下、日本陸軍發言人一面承認採用武力之可能、一面尚聲稱抱用和平方法謀取解决之希望、蓋不獨在手工作、現已不少、且若用兵取熱、費用旣須增多、生命亦將多所喪失、尤易引起海外誤會、而予外人反對者以口實、况熱河大戰一經開始、爲戰略關係或有在華北擴大戰爭之必要也、華人及許多外人以爲日人現覓取侵入華北奪取平津之機會、惟東京不承認此說、日方謂日本固有不負責任之激烈派歡迎此種發展、但負責領袖則深知戰事延及中國本部、必將引起危險的國際糾紛、故戰事區域將來如竟擴至中國本部、則係出於與奪取熱河計劃有開之軍略上必要、而非故意出此也、但日人雖口稱欲以和平方法取得熱河、而避免中國本部之戰事、但陸軍省發言人近曾語路透訪員、謂大危機所在、爲槍彈之偶爾誤落、日本固不欲在最近將來時期中、有大舉於熱河、但黑夜槍聲之偶爾一發、即可爲開火大戰致生極重大後果之警號、陸軍省發言人此語、作於耶誕節將至之日、相隔甫數日、而榆關戰事已作、日人殆早已預計之矣、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>葉山　齊藤首相昨日下午赴葉山别墅靜養、關於熱河問題及國聯形勢談曰、張學良在熱河方面、極力增加軍隊、日軍應要準備、應付其積極行動、然現在「滿洲國」内之日軍、足以彈壓中國軍積極行動、故無由内地調兵之必要、日本解决熱河、</p>
<p>問題、須要努力不使事態擴大至「滿洲國「領土之外、此則日本解决熱河問題之根本方針也、至於國聯情勢、余未接完全報告、然關於中日問題、似無適當辦法、預料國聯定必考慮打開局面方法、以容納日本主張云云、（十五日聯電）</p>
<h3>駐美公使施肇基之演説</h3>
<p>日本行動破壞世界和平</p>
<p>希望列强勿採容忍政策</p>
<p>漢浦敦　中國駐美公使施肇基在此演説、對於國聯處置中日爭執、果否能有堅决行動、表示疑慮、以爲國聯行動或將視各大國今後之决定以爲斷、在最後結論中聲稱、「列强究宜維持國聯與各和平條約之神聖、抑寗受對日採取容忍政策之結果、兩者孰爲重要、應即有所决定、惟渠對於列强此種决定、仍覺難抱樂觀、」又謂、「日本之侵略、乃對世界秩序之攻擊、苟各國無應付之决心、勢將危及文化、日本曾悍然爲破壞國聯·廢棄和平條約·與違背東方道德·及西方法律觀念之威脅、但非至列强有必要之决定後、國聯將不能爲有效行動」云、（十五日國民社電）</p>
<h3>英日沆瀣一氣駐日英使訪内田果無政治作用歟</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　英國駐日大使、最近曾拜訪日本當局、此間頃説明其拜訪之目的、謂僅在請日本政府對日軍占據區域内之英國僑民、維持其安全、而並非以英國在遠東、將有何種政治上行動預告日本、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美不向日本聲請保護華北美僑</h3>
<p>否則不啻承認日軍擴大行動</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國務院今日聲明、美國將不請日本保護華北美僑、據稱國務院認若欲請求保護華北美僑、應向中國政府聲請、而官塲中亦認若向日本聲請保護美僑、不啻承認日本將向華北方面擴張行動、但據聞國務院曾暗示、倘若中國北方再起衝突、則美國將警告中日雙方、保護美僑生命財產、又此間外交界評論、謂日内瓦方面對於榆關事件之緊張、已稍弛緩、且據外交界所得消息、似中日間亦不致再起衝突、更有若干外交家謂最近國聯改擬十九國委員會小組委員所草之决議案、以緩和日本之反對、亦與李頓爵最近表示之意見相合、（十四日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　英國觀察報社論、謂今日世界最可怖而最危險之事件、爲日本重力現集中以鞏固由朝鮮而至長城之亞洲大陸上日本威權、凡抱踐實主義者、决不信日本目的物、將始終爲長城所限、日人計盡中、欲剷除張學良在華北之勢力、如張以北平爲根據地、則日軍終必進逼中國舊都、日本有意擇此機會、了無疑義、東京固知英俄美德莫予毒也、以滿洲本境言、日本確有重要利益、而中政府未能保護之、致使日本自行處置、但日本所行者、已超過其原來目的、而使其可爲人原諒之理由、變成如進行不已將被全世界一致聲討之舉動、吾人現除承認日本能行其所爲者、及力勸日本勿破壞長城外、不能有所作爲、吾人必拒絶承認「滿洲國」、想日本人民終可就理智之範圍、而不盲從於濫用武力、但若日本現鑄成大錯、則必有之結果、將爲日本本身之滅亡云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本在太平洋中積極軍事佈置</h3>
<p>違反國聯委治原則</p>
<p>丨予美國一大威脅丨</p>
<p>（華盛頓）伊拉克原係國聯會委任英國統治之地方、最近經英國予以解放、並承認其爲國聯會員、美國政界某要人對於此事、有所表示、謂關於委任統治地任何辦法、如未經美國同意、不能生效、因委任統治制度、係因對德戰勝後始行成立、而戰勝德國、美國與有力焉、歐戰終結巴黎媾和時、宣布各種原則、其中一種、即各國在委任統治地境内、對本國人民及他國人民應一律予以平等待遇、不許獨佔何項利益、且不許作何秘密行爲云、美國某要人此種宣言、似係特别針對日本在太平洋内喀羅林島之統治權、此外上年十一月十一日國聯會委任統治委員會討論日本統治地問題時、有人對日本無理由支出之經費、亦曾提出抗議、前後兩事可以互相對照、日本統治各島、位於菲列濱羣島與夏威夷島之間、由日本在該處之舉動觀之、可使人信其對於上述原則、並未遵守、美國雖非國聯會會員、但對於日本之委任統治權、仍可要求撤銷也、）十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>當前之抗日問題</h3>
<p>乃</p>
<p>國人如不健忘。當猶能憶九一八事變突起之時。謀國之士。擁兵之將。文電煌煌。所昭示於吾人者。一則曰「世間終有公理。」再則曰「逆來順受。不予抵抗。」迨敵寇深入。逼近關外最後防線之錦州。知不予抵抗之非計也。於是乃有「長期抵抗」之宣示。疆吏亦有「誓死守士」之通電。然不旋踵而錦州又不戰而退矣。錦州失陷之後。當局雖亦曾表示「决不再使寸土有失。」然亦未聞於軍事上有若何之準備於是山海關又陷落矣。九門口又被佔矣。所以然者。以尚未捨棄其依賴國聯之念也。</p>
<p>敵人知我情形甚深故軍事方面。於戰略上取逐步征服之方法。於人則取逐個擊破之方法當日人之掩有東三省也。世界輿論。曾譁然於一時。守錦將土。亦表示必死之决心。倘日人於此時而遽進攻錦州。則國際形勢。必然緊張。我方拒抗必甚强烈。是則於彼爲不利。故遲之又久。俟輿論責難漸告平息。我方將士。怒氣消沉。乃略藉口實。急切進兵。遂能兵不血刃而取錦州。由錦州失守以至於山海關之陷落。日人殆均運用其一成不變之方略。宰割我土地。一割之後。姑暫置之。則可以旦旦而伐。至死而不遇抵抗。若一日之間。一割再割。則懦者亦將因痛無可忍而興奮日人取逐步征服之方法。用意在此。再日人於一二八滬變時。聲言目標專爲十九路軍。而不與其他軍隊開釁。其後對於東北義勇軍之攻擊。復以威逼利誘之手段使國軍不敢公然援助。至於今日。而山海關之戰事。又以專對張學良聞矣。日人旣熟悉國人苟安之心理。則此種逐步征服與逐個擊破之方法。自爲至毒而至有效者也。</p>
<p>其與軍事相輔而行者。一方面在外交上。亦即運用此逐步征服。逐個擊破之意思。以施之於國聯各强國。先以種種延宕與恐嚇之手段。使各强國不敢决定其主張。以俟時勢之轉變。然後再從容派遣能言善辯之外交代表。向各國以甘言遊説。使各個强國回心轉意。如松岡洋右及他代表等奔走接洽。秘密活動。於每一次開會時每一國代表間。更施展其誘脅挑撥之技倆。今可證明其已獲得滿美之効果。試觀昨日報紙載日方所傳新妥恊案。謂一杉村已與魯德蒙成立諒解。「其所諒解各點。直是純徇日人之意我人猶疑日人之過意宣傳。今觀國民社日内瓦電。則竟謂「德魯蒙已將新决議案草稿送致中日代表。徵求同意。其内容與十九國委員會舊提草案。大相逕庭。旣無一字晤及滿洲僞組織。亦未提及美國與蘇俄。僅暗示有邀請若干非會員國加入調解之可能性而已。」此種新草案。旣專爲日人帮忙之議案。則將來大會之情形。所以想見國聯已爲日本逐步征服矣。列强已爲日本逐個擊破矣。何怪乎日人之表示歡欣。而慶其外交之成功也。</p>
<p>日人在找不抵抗政策之下。而以此逐步征服逐個擊破之方法。施用於軍事外交兩方面。皆已獲有顯著之成績。已逼我於途窮水盡之境。不抵抗之　誤已至若此。因循苟安之失策已至若此。我國人亦已有所覺悟乎。</p>

<h3>赿界電話</h3>
<p>據電政司主管電話事宜之第四科科長黄修靑談、赿界築路電話合同、始因工部局方面擬以英方本爲正本、而以華文本爲副本、嗣後幾度商洽、决定改以華文本爲正本、現時雙方所磋商未能即行簽字者、即爲華文本字句之磋商、日來已大致就緒、兩週内可完全解决、該條例全文十九條、内容俟簽字後即公佈、聞其大致辦法、凡在赿界築路區域内裝置電話者、對工部局方面同様負給租界電話月費之義務、同時對中國電話公司每月付着之辦法、依其接線之遠近便否、規定自月給一元餘至四元餘費用、此項費用、純爲主權所關、及中國電話公司接線之補助、至北區一段、可由中國電話公司裝置者、接線時工部局方面擬定每次接線費五分、中國方面、正擬徐圖交涉、設法于華租界雙方對接通話設備、漸次完備、將來對每次五分之辦法、商議取消或減輕、但此與合同本身、不成問題耳、記者旋詢以南北市改裝自動電話之通話時間、據云南市已定二月初通話、南北則因一二八後、線路全部損失、修理手續稍繁、須三月初、方可通話、</p>

<h3>招商局事</h3>
<p>史氏繼謂、關天招商局方面、外傳債務人請予增高償欵成數、交部方面、尚未接此項公文、此事應由理事會商定、至股東方面、有小部份、最近又呈請交通部請增加股票價格、但此係行政决定、殊無可變更、交部惟有予以批斥云云、</p>

<h3>恐已沉沒</h3>
<p>通裕公司經理陳已生、因餘隆輪失蹤、特電香港無線電臺、請其以無綫電助尋後、仍未得餘隆輪復電、疑該輪係途遇颸風、已失事沉沒、或爲海盜刦去、及至本月二日、四川路二十九號英平公司輪船、途中接餘隆輪無綫電、僅報自己船名、詢問對方船名、英平輪當即電復、但旋忽斷絶、據此猜測、恐係即於發電時下沉、但據新平安船主亞爾遜、即餘隆輪船主之兄、謂上海至基隆綫來入輪船甚多、如餘隆果沉沒、决不致迄今無支證明、恐爲盜刦、被其將無綫電拆去、或遇盜後始觸礁沉沒、</p>
<h3>家屬恐慌</h3>
<p>餘隆輪船員家屬、　　自得該輪失蹤消息後、初得爲途中遇霧誤期、繼經公司分電訪尋無着、於是羣起恐慌、知　多吉少、迄至本月、仍未見餘隆輪蹤跡、船員家屬、每日赴公司探詢者、絡繹不絶、及至十日起、家屬以迄今已將一月、恐已失事、連日聯合赴公司坐候、哀求救濟、</p>

<h3>惡丈夫</h3>
<p>丨冰女士來信丨</p>
<p>我是一個被丈夫虐待者，覺得做人毫無趣味；目下極想自殺，但是尙有三個兒子，大的五歲，小的不過一歲，我死後，恐他們亦同歸於盡，眞是進退兩若難。近日神經紛亂，自殺的念頭，終日盤桓在我腦裏，望先生導以光明之路，則不勝感激，亦小兒之厚！今將我的生活略述於下：</p>
<p>我今年廿九歲，結婚已八年了，我們先由媒妁之介紹而相見，次相通信，又相約面談，他說很合意，只徵求我的意見如何，斯時，我見</p>
<p>他是一個大學畢業生，又很樸實，我是處於舊家庭，只知從衆從俗，就此答應，同他定婚，隨後就結婚。</p>
<p>示結婚前，他已離敎學之職，賦閒在家。婚後半年，他的眞面目就出現。開口則駡，動手就打，我從小未見過如此一惡的人，也從未受過如此痛苦！斯時又要顧面子，對人亦不敢言，有苦自受，只暗中哭泣而已！但我不抵抗，他則得步進步，大的小孩產生後沒有幾日，因我未入廚房之故，又被他毒打。每次被打，總是因些小事。或小婢不聽敎，或小兒哭等等。他時常飲酒縱性，打得我東青西黑，後來我實在受不了，有時也與抵抗有又値他吃上了鴉片，性子稍爲和平點，我方得少受一些痛苦。</p>
<p>他對於妻子，非常吝嗇，要他替我做一件事衣。買一對鞋，都很困難，結婚至今，未見他自動買一樣物件給我，甚至零用的錢也要不到一個。</p>
<p>結婚今，他就一和失業，只雇用過半年娘姨，每次分娩，呌他請一個臨時娘姨都不肯。老父寫信來，呌我無論如何，產後一個月中，總要僱一個人，千萬要保養身體，并寄錢給我，但我對他說，我出工錢，僱用娘姨他都不肯。但我對他說，我出工錢，僱用娘姨他都不肯。他若眞沒有錢，我也情願共甘苦，雖做死亦無怨言，但他並不是沒有錢，每天要吃多少鴉片，那來的錢呢？只顧自己快樂，人心安在？現在一家六口，我與小婢，終日忙碌，做事時常負小兒於背上，若一哭又被駡。他終日以駡爲能事的。我一有暇，又要敎敎小兒認字，又要做做針線，一夜護兩小兒，總要起床四五次，日間又無片時休息，還要受氣，近來身體瘦弱，精神的萎頓，真不堪設想了！</p>
<p>他今年己戒斷烟癮，但這兩個月被妓女所迷惑，更視我如眼中釘，初時一禮拜去過宿一宵，近來則兩三夜不歸，現在是每天要出去的，大約又要吃上烟癮了。我稍相勸，則忠言逆耳，大聲喝詫，如此下去，看來非達到妻離子散，他不會覺悟的！</p>
<p>要省儉些，可以預備他們將來的學費，他説；到那時再説，沒有錢就不要讀書。我又説：你年紀快將四十，尚不設法謀事，他説：年老了，更應快樂一時得一時。如此的人，真難相勸！且他品性很暴的，前面已經講過，多説兩句就發脾氣了，一發脾氣連小孩子都不敢近前，隨他一人孤獨去。我到他家八年，未曾是見過他有朋友來經過，連父兄弟妹都不來往的。他去的是妓院，燕子窠，大世界，電影塲，除此就無高尚地方消遣了。（我見他無親戚朋友，覓事更難了，終日無所事事，我曉得他亦很煩悶的，但他品性與人不同，若事不成功，就要駡人多事，我只偷偷東奔西跑去託人設法。去年我親戚代覓好兩處職位，人家親自來呌他去，他都不肯去，直是一言難盡。）他現在迷於嫖妓吸烟，連書亦無心披閱，做事一層，更不要提了。我見他不務正業，時時愛悶，長此以往，終會有坐吃山空之日。他這個人是毫無情感的，我有病時，亦不入房看看，問亦不問一聲，反而出外不歸。但無論他如何對我不好，我始終是愛他的。我一向亦以誠心相對，未有反抗過他一様事。他不能原諒我，我也無可奈何。</p>
<p>離婚一層，我是不能的。因爲從前曾提議離婚老父聞知，卽臥病數日，時爲我下淚。我上念老父，下愛兒子，只有被他虐待而死，以盡我心·</p>
<p>但近日他虐待我更甚，回家無些好面目相對，不要説穿用，連菜錢亦不留一文，小兒零食亦不管，如此可忍不可忍呢？一月家用數十元，他就心痛非常，但在外一兩夜用數十元，反毫無吝啬，這不是刻薄嗎？</p>
<p>目下爲數兒謀將來幸福計，欲訴之於法，與他分居，將股票利息及兒子歸我管理，未知可否？若歸我管，一年可積兩三百元，將來小兒的學費，就可减輕了。不然，受他如此刻薄，實無生人的樂趣。究竟如何可使我安適，望有以敎我·</p>
<p>覆：女士來信，讀之慨然。未答覆之先，我要要求女士站在新時代的前面，空無依傍地來聽我説，那才會有益，不然，記者縱竭智盡力以爲女士告，也是徒勞：㈠女士應該下大决心和那不成才的烟鬼丈夫一刀兩斷，乾脆和他離婚。㈡爲着兒輩的敎育，自然也可和他相見於法庭，要求管理他的財產或平分股票，若是必要的話；㈢女士的父親的話萬不可聽：他的腦子充滿了孔二先生的「三從四德」舊禮敎，他一輩子犧牲了，沒有辦法，你還願意同他一塊兒下火坑麽？若果這様，那女士，我要冒犯一句，你的前途也就不值得我們的同情了，㈣至於自殺，那不是我們具有向上心的人類所應有的念頭。我們不要自殺，却要有自殺的决心來和這養成社會一般自殺的心理和造成社會逼人自殺的種種關係，禮敎等等的社會制度奮鬥。記得，杜威夫人在中國時説了一句很好：「我不自殺；假使我要自殺，我得先殺死幾個人（大意如此）」；我却要補充一句；我决不自殺，尚要與這逼人自殺的社會做殊死戰。前途自有光明，自殺是懦者的可恥心理，願女士勿復存此想！</p>
<p>無法投遞函件一束</p>
<p>㈠郭非句君鑒：請將搆造原理，詳細開示，如確有成功可能，本報當代爲宣揚。㈡石清君鑒：來函所述，尚係一種表面觀察，中國今日之病，在於國際資本主義與殘餘土封建勢力兩種壓迫，救治之法，必須根本加以改造，來函所陳，實皆是枝節。㈢趙藴山君鑒：本埠增刋·以性質限於行銷本埠，故向不遞送外埠，（足下如有機會一讀本埠增刋，便知其無遞送外埠必要。）此不獨本報爲然，其附刋於本埠增刋内之其他增刋，當然亦連带受其限制，來函所要求，本報誠深感盛意，但事實上恕難照辦，應請原諒！㈣　君鑒：足下所採手段，吾人不能贊同，足下現在惟有趕速回家，向哥哥認罪，請其原諒，一面徐謀職業，眼疾自然應設法診治，「自殺」與「遁迹空門」，吾人絶對反對，其理由請參觀今日本欄答復冰女士一信。㈤陳正木君鑒：唯有再託親友向父解説，務請允許足下結束一年半之學業，然後再助其營商，否則祗有暂且輟學。至讀畢中學後，如經濟力實有不及，自不必再升大學，休學若干年，以後如有機會，仍可繼續讀書，㈥廣梅人君鑒：足下與對方結合，並未經過法律上正當手續，故由法律上言之，足下現在如棄對方而另與他人結婚，並不負若何責任，但自道德上言之，足下旣自動與對方結合，現在任意抛棄，置對方利益於不顧，則有未合，故足下現在若决意意對方分離，如對方完全同意，自不生問題，否則對於對方將因此所受之痛苦，足下不能不予以相當之補救，總須以「雙方有益」爲前提。</p>

<h3>特載中小學衛生敎學法徐蘇恩講華記</h3>
<p>民國二十一年度、上海市敎育局定爲健康敎育中心計劃的年度、計劃的詳細辦法、道　似可不必談、不過我們知道公開演講灌輪健康敎育的智識給全市中小學敎職員、象你這中心計劃所規定的實施方法之一、二十一年十二月二十七日市敎育局乃請衛生　技七中央大學校衛生科主任　　患醫師、蒞滬演講這　目、出席聴講人數逾五百、演講的材料頗感重要、爰　筆記之於次、傳供沒有出席的同志參考、（　　附誌）</p>
<p>國家嚴重得到了像這個様子、對於次人國民的敎育如何再不可放　、不差、敎育固該重視、而一般敎育中的衛生敎育、似乎也值得急起直追的注意、中小學的民式課程標準、現由敎育部頒布了、課程中的衛生科、可算是新鮮科目、倘不加以祥細的解釋、不免流於各自爲政、或多「試行錯誤、時間精神兩不經濟、上海市敎育局看清這點、邀本席來談談、願供一得之見、供　如左、</p>
<h3>現在是過渡時期</h3>
<p>衛生旣是新課程、前無基礎、後無參考、實在難於　手施行、現在的時期、可稱之曰過渡時期、我們惟有根據地方情形和這次上海市辦的學校衛生人員訓練班的資料、加以組織、作爲敎學的張本、</p>
<h3>何年級開始敎學</h3>
<p>小學校衛生敎育、究竟那一年級開始、有人主張高年級、有人提倡低年級、意見紛歧、莫衷一是、我赞成小學一年起、　要開始敎學的、爲的是實行比較便利、年尤小好習慣尤易養成、能在嬰兒時實行衛生敎育、更是我們昕夕所企求的、敎學方法、應把以往的經騐作基礎、（記者按、這是敎學法上的統覺主　、將新經騐建築在舊經騐身上、）</p>
<h3>兒童自己負責任</h3>
<p>在过渡時期、很少舊經騐可以利用、那末靑年兒童自己要多負些衛生敎育責任、中學生各個自己大半能負責了、我們預備百分之六十待他們自己解决、小學一年生自己負不了什麽責任、勢必傷勞敎　　　五六年生、自己當心自己、差不多　　得下、祗要敎師在旁指導便得、</p>
<h3>學理行爲並注意</h3>
<p>這不像别的東西、衛生敎育責任在　理舉行爲並重、專門知道些原則原理、不能發生行爲、那何須首學習、但年齡有　幼、　　　　低、學理與行爲的分景、遂不可一槪而論、小學高年生不妨多學些學理、低年生智力未開、該多學些良善行３</p>
<p>爲、昕謂行爲、當然、習慣也包括在内了、中學生智識　當、鑒别力堅强、敎材内容、可整個兒學習、如果敎學得法、許多學理、自會行爲化的、這層較小學易有成績、</p>
<h3>先來談小學方面</h3>
<p>小學是中學的基礎、小學衛生敎學　　　學衛生敎學法的基礎、凡轉中學敎師、總要　　些小學衛生敎學法、在座的中學敎師們請耐心的研究一下吧、</p>
<p>小學方面唯一的原則、「行」比「知」更重要、普通智與行好像鳥　翼、車的前輪、一様地要緊、可是　到衛生、行丨習慣、却緊要得多了、我們敎兒童每天大便一次、我們敎兒童每日户外運動、却不一定要敎他知道所以然、只要實行、目的己算達到、　他　　後再告訴其所以然、也不爲</p>
<h3>第一步驟須調查</h3>
<p>爲利便計、分作幾個步驟來講、第一步驟便是學年或健康敎育計劃開始時、對學生及其家長、作一精密的調查、下邊五張表格、㈠兒童健康紀錄表、敎　負責　寫、年齡　　足計、　體重　應脫衣鞋、體重增加率　定時間一準、一年一次或一年　次、以及皮　的顏色、乾濕情形、　望塡清楚、㈠敎師審查兒童衛生習慣表、喪中有無機會一項、倒很着重、有　　而不實踐、成爲一　３</p>
<p>問題、沒機會而不實踐、那是另一　問題㈢兒童自己審察衛生習慣表、這表現年齡　　而定、由敎師自編、下　的表式、高年級可應用、㈣家是審察兒童衛生習慣表、這　點學校與家庭間聯絡、上第的學生家長、比内地開通得多、似乎容易舉行㈤衛生智識及態度測騐表、學年終了或健康敎育計劃實施告一段　分向各兒童答復表　的問題、看他究竟　了些什麽了　、</p>
<p>科學界研究資料之趣聞</p>
<p>[P牛腎生石與人腎結石</p>
<p>名畫家馬企周先生發表牛腎有石</p>
<p>佛慈大藥廠研究部詳述人腎結石</p>
<p>據上海各報載，名專家馬企周先生昨晨購牛腎，欲烹佐　，剖之，腎内忽現似石非石，似骨非骨，大小多粒之物，大者　棒，小者如豆，其質堅，其色白，　之重　二錢，且上多金星，光耀五色云，自此趣　發　報端後，一般愽學家皆感非常興趣，茲略介紹上海佛慈藥廠國產藥物研究發表人腎結石症之新學説，以供本報讀者　君之參考</p>
<h3>一·腎臟結石之解剖的變化</h3>
<p>尿之沉　作用，　　内多　　　　　　　，牛或其他動物皆然，　其結石之大小，有腎　粉，腎砂粒，與腎石等之名稱，腎砂粉者，爲徵細粉狀之渣滓，腎砂粒者·其形如普通砂粒·能容易通過給尿管，腎石小者如粟粒大者如碗豆·隨　化學成分變化之　何·有尿　　結石·　　監結石·灰酸　結石等之别腎結石中患尿腎結石症爲最多其石質硬　，表面滑澤，或呈　粒狀，其色有　赤色與暗黑色兩種。燐酸鹽結石·由燐酸　之　　而發生，。此種結石，容易破時局畫報熱河湯玉麟將軍佛</p>
<p>碎，其表面　　　　　　　　　　　　　色。</p>
<p>此外尚有種種化學成分變化之結石四五類，但此屬專門學説，故茲略而不　。</p>
<h3>二·腎臟結石症之原因及法</h3>
<p>人腎結石形狀之大小，與數量之多寡，人人不同，誰無一定之標準，然腎臟結石，因其占有空間之如何，有大　　　者，有形如鹿角　奉狀，而占領全腎，波及　　者，以是之故，腎臟結石症，遂引起腎盂炎，腎石痛等疾患，致危及生命，腎臟結石症之原因，槪因濫人酒肉而發生者　　最多，又有患痛風症，或由父母遺傳而患腎臟結石者，頗不乏人，至其治療法，其雖有物理療法，　物療法，及外科開刀，腎臟採石得等腎氣丸爲妙。</p>
<h3>三·腎氣丸之醫治作且</h3>

<h3>造糞機器</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>人難道真是（萬物之靈）嗎？我却有些懹疑。何以螞蟻是　　，却能夠好勇鬥狠，和壯士一般；蜘蛛也是　類，並不學著建築和幾何學，却能夠結網　；警犬和戰馬，何以沒有「倒戈」「臨陣怯逃」等勾當；可知人爲「萬物之靈」，簡直當之有愧！</p>
<p>無論甚麽蟲，魚，鳥，獸，敦不知道「吃飯」「撒尿」「生殖」，人們的本能，也不過這幾件事。可是人們爲了這幾件事，忙得不亦樂乎，甚麽戰爭「食」「色」兩字上生出來的·仔細想想，　不可笑。</p>
<p>做人的花様真多：位尊一國，撫有萬邦，名呌元首；雄材蓋世，權略過人，名呌梟雄；富有銅山，擁資千萬，名呌富翁；家無擔石，室若懸　，名呌貧士；驚才絶艷，壤瑋倜備，名呌才子；儀態萬方，絶色傾城，名呌美人。可是仔細想來，細想來，無論聖賢，毫儏，奸雄，盜賊，富翁，贫士，才子，美人·········，都是　　践，吃飯拉屎，並沒有特異的徵象；活時候，都是一部「造糞機器」，死了誰不做了「土　頭　」。試問秦皇，漢武，拿翁，邵通，石崇，西施，王嬙，相如，潘郎······，現在都到那里去了。</p>
<p>有了這前提，用邏輯的方法，歸納起來，倒可得着一個結論：便是「人是一部造糞機器。」什麽聖賢，豪傑，奸雄，盜賊，富翁，貧士，才子，美人·······都不是人們妄自分别吧。　如山珍海錯，不是肥料的元素嗎？人們因爲白己還不明白自己是一部「造糞機器」，妄分了許多色相，定了許多名目，於是人心便有了「愛」「憎」「驕」「謟」「悲」「樂」「恨」「怒」·······等情緒，而天下從此多事了。唉！</p>
<h3>萬花筒高</h3>
<p>— 啟沃</p>
<p>中國社會彷彿是一具萬花筒·都市裏，資本主義形態發狂般躍進着，機械，汽車，爵士音樂，一切資本主義社會裏所應有的大半都完備了；然而在鄕村裏或其他偏僻的地方農人還是用十八世紀的生產方法種着田，依然有封建式的地方，有中古式的「趕集」，有用作運輸唯一工具的獨輪車·</p>
<p>再沒　個國家像中國這様發展不均的，甘肅的文化，據説要比江蘇落後四百年，這様的情形正如一個人的四肢肥瘦不等一般，簡直是一種畸形的發育了·南生氏的中國之謎一書總算是道破了中國社會的隱處·</p>
<p>要解這「中國之謎」，我想也不是困難的事，唯一的要圖，自然是發展交通：但中國交通事業在紓缓爬行之中更往往受個人的侵害·安徽的蕪廣鐵路因爲主辦人員捲欵潛逃，乃致無法進行；最近如招商局私和外人簽定借欵合同，甚至交通次長也身與其事·這様又怎能使中國交通發展，又怎能使中國文化均匀統一，打破這萬花筒的社會？</p>

<p>丨兩種無稽的傳説丨</p>
<p>諸位如果高興的話，請來聽我講兩種傳説，雖然是很無稽的，但總可以解解悶，好在其目的並不是做什麽考據。</p>
<p>現在一般摩登男士莫不喜歡着西服，着西服的人除了在西服店做一套上下裝和背心而外，至少還得要到百貨商店去買一條領带；一個人如果沒有領带，任他的西服有多麽漂亮他都不敢穿起上街的（但在夏季穿翻領襯衫的是例外）就是行爲古怪的倭鬼子，穿西服時可以不戴帽子，但無論如何也要用一條二指寛的褲带似的領带。小子也是喜穿西服的·常常感覺到領带這東西之不必要：熱天束上太熱·冷天束上如果稍緊了點連呼吸都不自在。旣是這様，爲什麽西洋人一定要用它呢？有人説·這是一種妝飾，用慣了的。誠然，但沒有它，又有什麽不美呢？爲了這問題我曾問過好些西服朋友，但他們都不能答覆得很圓滿，其中有一位這様説：（他亦是聽見旁人説的。）</p>
<p>歐洲紀元後四百年頃，曾發生日耳曼民族大遷徒事情，其原因是由於漢朝竇憲把北匈奴打敗了，北匈奴遂侵入歐洲，日耳曼人爲匈奴所迫遂引起大遷徙。其時黄種的匈奴人打了勝仗，捉着白種的日耳曼人便都把來栓着頸子牽着走，用來栓頸子的带子又都是從擄去的中國婦女的小脚解下來的裏脚布，這様是表示侮辱日耳曼人。後來他們被放了，爲了紀念那種恥辱，便相率在頸子上加一條带子，這様沿習成風傳遍了歐洲，更成爲今日時髦的領带。</p>
<p>另一種無稽的傳説是關於西服上裝袖子上所用的幾顆扣子的。據説從前歐洲某個國王的侍衛們有一個很壞的習慣，常常用他們的袖子去擦鼻涕，這様汚了衣服還是小事，當國王召見大臣或與别的國王會面的時候，那却是很失禮貎的舉動。國王累次警告他們都不生效果，便想了一個妙法，在他們的袖子上加上幾顆扣子，如果侍衛們再用袖子擦鼻涕，那扣子會刮得他們的鼻子疼痛，這麽一吓，他們的壞習慣便漸漸革掉了。後來侍衛們出街，晉通人看見他們的袖子上有扣子，還認爲這是漂亮的新裝哩，以後大家都在袖子上加幾顆扣子，但不知怎的都加在袖子的下方，大槪是他們沒看清楚吧。</p>

<h3>鳩與獵人</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>某日，有一位獵人，带了槍，上山去打獵，在山上東奔西走了一天，毫無所獲，心裏非常愁悶，獨自坐在森林中的石上休息。忽然後而飛來一雙鳩，這鳩與獵人很相識的，飛到前而向獵人道：</p>
<p>鳩丨丨「老伯伯，你今天有什麽不快樂的事？我看你的而容，露出很枊鬰的様子，可以告訴我嗎？」</p>
<p>獵人丨丨「不滿你説，我今天一早出門，跑到山裏來，到了此刻，還沒有一些東西得到，而兩隻腿跑得酸痛，腹裏又很飢餓，所以鬰悶極了。」</p>
<p>鳩丨丨「老伯伯，旣然這様，請到我的家裏去吃一些點心，充充飢吧。」獵人就跟他到家裏，那鳩把自己的糧草丨丨蟲·　丨丨等物，送給獵人，可是鳩的食物，獵人不能吃的，那親切的鳩，看見獵人不能吃自己的糧草，説道：　　「老伯伯，請你稍等一歇，就有很鮮美的燒肉，供給老伯伯吃呢。」</p>
<p>他一面説，一面啣了樹枝一大堆，放在獵人面前，請獵人用火點着，等到火𦦨猛烈時，他�</p>
<p>即飛入猛火之中，獵人眼見他飛入火中，急想去救他，然而那鳩已燒死了。獵人以爲鳩（不惜身命以施人，爲我而死。）泫然淚下，表示痛惜。</p>
<h3>肥皂泡</h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>用洗衣的肥皂，砌成碎末，放在碗中，加清水攪拌之，再加白糖少許，用管吹之，必能吹得有大，而且能高飛遠颺。若是沒有白糖混入，單用肥皂水，旣不能吹大，而且容易破裂。因爲攙以白糖，能够使肥皂水增加粘性，所以吹得很大時，也不易破裂了。</p>
<h3>鐘表問答</h3>
<p>— 韻</p>
<p>問：鐘錶的種類很多，現在世界上以什麽地方製的爲最好？</p>
<p>答：「那當然以瑞士爲最好。因爲瑞士國製造時計，好比我國人養　一般的，他們鄕下人，在空閑時期，專門製造粗細的螺旋·齒輪·法條·游絲等品，所以國内大多數農民，都會製造，製造愈多，出品自然精良了。」</p>
<p>問：「我們去買鐘鳙，以何種式様爲最宜？」</p>
<p>答：「手錶中以三型的瑞士貨爲最宜，也有八型九型的，掛鐘以十六型爲最宜。至於錶殻，以鋼殻爲最耐用。現在尚奢華摩登的人，多用金殻的，可是金殻的錶，内部的機械，未必是好的。」</p>
<p>問：「型的意義怎様？」</p>
<p>答：「這是機械的直徑算法，一型的長度，爲」</p>
<p>二·二五五五米里，九型就是九倍。」</p>
<p>問：「機械中最重要的是什麽東西？」</p>
<p>答：「機械中最緊要的，是嵌在齒輪車軸的穴石，這石爲防車軸的摩擦而裝置的。普通便宜的錶，都用柘榴石，好的錶，採用紅色寶石，或用録色寶石，金鋼鑽等貴重品。用這種寶石的錶，大槪是優良品。有一種錶，嵌進二十三粒的寶石，但是真正好的錶，並不限於多嵌寶的錶，大概是優良不易損壞的錶，祗嵌七粒，而便宜容易壞的錶，也有嵌十五粒柘榴石的。總而言之。假如嵌有七粒寶石的錶，必定是好的。</p>

<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第三章　業務之情形（續）</p>
<p>若然是貧苦之家，恐怕中醫診過，西醫望望然去之；新舊診過，舊醫也落得說另請高明，結果則他們還是求仙老爺，吃香灰罷了。此外等而下之，就發生誇大的宣傳，巧言的敷衍，樹窗的廣告，奇形怪狀，不一而足，一言以蔽之，學術不夠，要硬混飯吃，或者學而不時，不免斵喪些品格，以謀衣食罷了。所以近來醫師公會中人，雖想把那些怪現象，略事整頓，可也頗費周章，祗能從過於貽害社會的方面，先行着手取締。</p>
<p>這様一算。全上海的醫師，舊醫，西醫，三項靠醫吃飯的。有三千多人，實在平均不到千人，就有一人。而况神道設敎，江湖術士，猶不在内。可以稱得供過於求，那麽安得不混亂呢？</p>
<p>我曾經研究過上海所以醫家過剩的道理：㈠凡是外國畢業回來的，沐了歐風美雨，當然在他的生活上技術上，都以上海爲便利，於是就在上海開業了。㈡上海有幾個公立私立醫學校。其中的學生，在求學時代以上海爲第二家鄕，畢業以後，當然喜歡在上海開業，而且實習時候所看見的設備種種，也覺得内地不易措置。㈢上海爲經濟中心，人人想在上海撈摸幾文，也是重要原因。㈣上海比較各種醫院多些，那些醫院裏的看護生，妄自出來懸牌應診。也覺得上海來得駕輕就熟。㈤内地因時局不靖，政事杌隉，遷來上海居住的人民，在近十年中，要增加到一百多萬，於是將内地素負時望的幾位醫者，一同带了來。㈥最可笑的，在這有力量到上海的一百多萬人民中間，自然有不少讀書種子，恰巧我們貴國的舊醫學，敎作什麽「儒理内外方脈，」讀書人個個可以無師自通當醫生。那些人到了上海，被高高的生活程度壓迫着，覺得海上寓公，不大好做，於是試以醫爲行業，託幾位名人登報一介紹，就說柳州世醫，歙縣名宿，如何有名，如何技神。再加上些自製秘方，家傳古籍的話，也足以聳人聽聞的了。偏偏上海人的脾胃，合着三吳人一句俗語，呌做「遠來和尚好看經，」往往趨之若　，要曉得三五小疾，本來不藥可愈，偶然方到病除，那位儒理醫家，也就「趁運十年，有病早治了。」就中一個得意，效　紛起，至於此種醫生，在他家鄕，是否享有盛名？到底何人的高足？那位的門徒？却還要調查起來。所以這種開業，早失了舊醫以傳統爲貴的真精神。海上的相面先生，往往在廣告中標着「無意仕途。相人訪友。」的語句，當然也有名醫的廣告中。説「不爲良相。隠醫濟世，一的話頭。那真正醫卜星相相得益彰了。</p>
<p>以現在上海市上，對於過剩的醫者，如何消納？對於混亂的醫界，如何整理？却是一個很大的社會問題。本文下面雖有幾條方法，足資參考，但是主要的樞紐，却還在政治上，雖說天演的理論，呌作「優勝劣敗，」可以任其自然淘汰。然而人民的常識不充足，我敢説現在市上，愈劣可以愈勝，愈優者未必不敗。爲什麽呢？因爲劣者面皮愈厚，所施的騙人技倆愈巧，而况醫術不是其他貨物可比，倘若要淘汰一個庸醫，要多少生命夫奉陪他呢？</p>
<p>此外對於平民與新醫的關係，以及新醫的專家與貧民的關係，都在下文論醫院的範圍以内，有所討論，並且略有些小小的貢獻。</p>
<p>還有新醫所利用的各項精良器械，和理學治療的各項器械，如太陽燈，愛克斯光，電熱機等等，也都嫌太不平民化，鄙人曾經在醫藥評論最近一期中，有過一篇意見發表，請讀者參看，本文不再細談了。</p>
<p>如今再談醫院，醫院的性質，大别分爲二類：就是公立醫院。和私立醫院，公立醫院，必須有的欵爲基金的或是常年金爲輔助，言始可以完成他的責任，而加惠於公衆。上海的醫院，在二十餘年前，絶少中國人自辦的，爲公衆服務，而耳熟能詳的，無非仁濟醫院，同仁醫院，寶隆醫院，新普育堂醫院，廣慈醫院，廣仁醫院這幾處。但是無一不是外國人所辦，或則外國慈善機關所籌欵項，或則受外國敎會之津貼，此外租界的工部局，辦理幾處醫院，是另含專門隔離的性質，與普通醫院不同。而工部局有醫務上的需要時，就委託以上幾個醫院代辦，謂之工部局指定醫院，於是那幾個醫院，都充滿了外國經濟的色彩。（未完）</p>

<h3>痰說一</h3>
<p>— 余雲屾</p>
<p>今人之所謂痰，非古人之所謂痰也。金價述痰飮之證曰，其人素盛今瘦，水走腸間，瀝瀝有聲，謂之痰飲，此乃水液停蓄胃腸中而作聲，非今人之所謂痰也。若今所謂痰，粘稠厚濁，安得　漉然作聲乎丨然則今人之　謂痰，古人云何？曰，謂之涏沬，謂之濁睡，金匱曰，水在肺，吐涏沬，是也，又曰，肺中寒，吐濁涕，是也。又曰，寸口脈數，其人欬口中反有濁唾涏沬者，何，師曰，爲肺痿之病，是也。又曰，風舍於肺，其人則欬，口乾喘滿，咽燥不渴，多唾濁沬，是也。又曰，欬逆上氣，時時唾濁，但坐不得眠，是也。又曰，此爲肺中冷，多涏唾，是也。又曰，時出濁唾，胆臭，是也，此皆今人之所謂痰也。今人言痰者多及於肺病，言肺病者多及於痰，而金匱肺癰肺痿欬逆上氣篇，及五藏風寒積聚篇，皆言肺病而不及痰，今人言痰者多及於欬，言欬者多及於痰，而金匱肺癰肺痿欬逆上氣篇，諸言欬者皆不及痰，痰飮欬啾篇於懸飮支飮言欬而不及痰，於痰飮言痰而不及欬，雖其篇名曰痰飮欬嗽，似痰與欬有關涉�</p>
<p>，然脈經引金匱四飮之文，痰飲作淡飮，千金方痰飲篇中大五飮丸，亦作淡飮，千金翼凡痰飮字，皆作淡飮，以此言之，痰字本當作淡，其作痰者，後人加痰以示病意，乃俗字也。正羲之初月帖，有淡悶干嘔之言，法帖刋誤以爲淡即古淡液之淡，干即古干濕之干，是亦以痰爲淡矣，一切經音義曰，淡陰，謂胸上液也，則又以痰飮爲淡陰矣，淡訓味薄，與病無涉，然淡與澹通，文選潘安仁金谷集詩註曰，澹與淡同，是也，曰則痰飮可作淡飮，亦可作澹飮，説文然，澹，水搖也，漢書禮樂志及班彪傳注曰，澹，動也，然則澹飮之爲病，水在胃中，搖動而作聲，故以爲名也，請更證之，千金大五飮丸，五曰流飮，水在腸間，動搖有聲，其曰水在腸間，動搖有聲，與金匱痰飮之水走腸間，瀝瀝有聲，正相合，則是金匱之痰飮，即千金大五飮丸之流飮，明矣。而痰即淡字，有動搖之義，亦明矣。然則大五飮丸别有三曰淡飮水，在胃中之言，何耶？曰，淡飲與流飮，病候相同，皆以動搖有聲而得名，大五飮丸以在胃者爲淡飮，在腸者爲流飮耳，要之，在胃在腸，淡飮流飮，合之爲一亦可，分之爲二亦可也，又經脈引金匱四飮之文，痰飮作淡飮，而於其下注曰，一云留飮，按　留字疑當作溜，誤脫水旁耳，何以言之，金匱言留飮之候，有脇下痛引缺益，於四飮中屢懸飮，千金方大五飮丸，一曰留飮，停水在心下，是留者，停也，停留則不得走腸間瀝瀝作聲矣，故知留字誤也，也其水走腸間，瀝瀝有聲，故知當作溜字，溜與流同，文選琴賦射雉賦注，皆以溜爲水流，可證，溜飲，即流飮也，是知古本脈經引金匱四飮之文，痰飲必有作流飲者，亦可知金匱古本痰飮兩字，必有作淡飮者，正與千金大五飮丸之流飮相合矣。至於篇目中欬嗽二字，乃因懸飮支飮有欬嗽之候而牽及之，非别爲欬嗽立門部也，故丹波以爲欬嗽二字可去，此說是矣。由此觀之，篇名之痰飲欬嗽四字，不相關涉，古本篇名，或不如此，考脈經有平肺痿肺癰欬逆上氣淡飮脈證之目，金匱之痰飮，或亦與肺痿肺癰欬逆上氣篇相合，如脈經之目，後世淺人，不知痰飮之義，以痰爲粘稠之涏沬濁唾，别立篇目，而据摭懸飮支飮中之欬嗽二字，以連合之，於是驟觀其篇目，遂與今人之諭痰欬者，同矣，此實大謬也。故吾謂欲論今日之痰，不宜援金匱爲言，而自來論痰者，皆　率金匱痰飮，　　論也。</p>

<h3>中國之肺病問題（一）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>㈠胃病早期診斷及治療之關係·····　　㈡肺病與醫藥······㈢肺病與手術之施行····㈣肺病之預防及療養院</p>
<p>肺癆病之在中國，已成爲社會最普通之疾病，　各國之疾病統計而論，則肺癆之死亡數約占全死亡數之七分之一，而肺癆患者之統計，至少在各種急性傳染病患者總數之十倍以上，誠最可恐懼之疾病也。</p>
<p>世界愈文明，文化日益進展，而肺癆之傳染亦愈廣，然在歐美各國，其公衆之衛生，亦隨時代而改進，故在歐戰之前，肺癆統計，已逐漸減少，惟在我國，肺癆之死亡率，較之突他各國，多至三倍以上，據北平第一衛生區民國十八年死亡統計之報告，每十萬人中，有三百零七人因肺癆而死，若在英國每十萬人中爲七十人，在德國爲九十三人，在日本爲一百三十二人，因肺癆而死亡，若依吾國人口之統計而觀，則每半分鐘全國當有一人因肺病而死，故肺癆之在中國，其潛伏之惡勢力實至偉大，至其侵襲吾人之年齡，以靑年爲最多，男子多自二十歲，至三十歲，女子自十五歲至二十五歲問，最易罹肺病，故人民直接之犧牲，與國家無形中之損失，殆無從預算或統計之，决非洪水猛獸，或急性傳染病等，所能相提並論，故肺病之在中國，在公共衛生行政，及醫學界上，爲最嚴重之問題。</p>
<p>我國肺癆死亡率之所以較高，其原因固由於公共衛生之設備未週，肺病療養院之缺乏，而國民衛生知識太低，對於本病，平時旣無相當研究，旣病不知隔離療養，實爲本病擴大傳染之最大原因，故欲目前解决中國之肺癆問題，實匪易事，此種艱鉅之工作，欲達目的，非國家的力量不可，非改良公共衛生設備不可，非使全國人民，有豐富之衛生知識不可，換言之，决非一朝一夕之力，所能爲功。</p>
<p>然在醫者之立塲而言，欲解决當前肺癆問題，則應注意下列之數點。（未完）</p>

<p>㈠營養之法，非僅飮食一端，還用種種衛生方法，相符而行，始能達其目的，今就衛生方面，分條述之：</p>
<p>甲、户外運動，吾人常安居室内，不事運動，旣不能受日光照射，又無良好空氣，體質當然衰弱，如每日散步室外，或之公園，或之郊外，得有日光照射，吸取新鮮空氣，身體各部得以運動，血液暢行遍體，營養富足，體質自强矣。乙、洗浴，全身之表皮，常時更新，換落之皮屑，與排出之液汁及皮脂結合，積成汚垢，日久即腐壞，並生臭氣，皮膚被其所傷，生出紅疹，此中細菌易於滋生，產出毒質，侵入皮内，而達内部，常受其毒害，則體質變弱，時受病苦，如每日洗浴一次，或間日行之亦可，然每星期至少浴洗一二次，如此常去其汚垢，皮膚不致受傷，使皮下血液流暢，營養旣足，皮當健矣，旣能却病，復能强身。</p>
<p>丙、新鮮空氣，鮮潔之空氣，富含氣，空曠之地，多有之，如公園，郊外，室外等之空氣，皆然，夫每氣一物，爲營養人身之一主要者，故人之呼吸，無時或絶，每日必須步出室外，多多吸入以補足之，室内空氣常換之，可將門窗開啓，使鮮潔者換入，每次至少開啓十分鐘，早晚二次爲不可缺，若久處不潔之空氣中，因營養不足，以致體弱，反之，則體健壯。</p>
<p>丁、精神與情感應保守適度，吾人之精神與情感如耗之過度，感之過分，致起疲乏，全身之機能，均現萎頓，反之，精神與情感安之不用，亦失其活動力，影響於營養至巨，故每日應善自調節，始能達健康營養之目的。</p>
<p>戊、控制性情，各人之性情，雖有不同，如有不良者，應自行控制，否則害及全體之營養，故可用養性法，以矯正之。</p>
<p>己、睡眠適度，吾人之生活，日出而作，日入而息，藉睡眠以資休復精神與體力，然時間亦須足彀，勞力者，每日之休息時，約十小時已足，勞心者，亦得足睡八小時，如時間減短，則致體力虧耗，過度者，則運動欠缺，亦有營養不良之弊，故以適度爲宜。</p>
<p>㈡飮食營養法，吾人之動作，無論一舉一動，均須消耗體力，故須每日用飮食物以補足之，然吾人又須繼續生存，應使其生活力連綿不絶，更當令其日日產生，並以保持其體質健全，庶能久存，故不能不稍事注意，然大自然間之飮食物，產之至富，尚須採用適當，並以確實有益者爲宜，如動植物界中之食物</p>
<p>旣以其中所含之質素，適合人體内之需要爲主，對於體内之消化力，亦不能不加以調製，而調製法務以不傷其原質爲良，就食物中之質素以蛋白質，脂　，澱粉三者爲主要成份，餘者　各種鹽類，水份，動植物細胞纖維質等，還有新鮮生活之動植物，其中含有一種生活素，爲增加吾人之生活力不可缺者，今將各種飮食物舉出一二例，依二主要成份分類列之於後，另將合宜之營養法及應忌者附之於尾，至於消化力及維他命之功用則從略。</p>
<p>子、　飲食物</p>
<p>一、富含蛋白質者</p>
<p>動物類、甲、肉類，牛，犢，閹羊，，小羊，猪，馬，兎，鵝，牝鷄，鴨，鴿等肉，牛犢之舌，心，肝，腎及牝牛乳汁。</p>
<p>乙、魚類，鯉，靑魚，　，鯽等肉。　　丙、蛋類、鷄，鴨，鵝等蛋之蛋白。　　丁、乳汁及其食品、牛，羊之乳汁，蛋白乳汁，乾酪，乳酪，牛乳餅。</p>
<p>植物類、甲、五榖及其食品，小麥粗細粉，米粉，玉蜀黍粉，燕麥粗粉及麥片，大麥麵粉，绿豆粉，粟米，通心粉，麵條，白麵包，牛乳麵包，小麥乾麵包。</p>
<p>乙、荳類、乾製豌豆，扁豆，蠶豆等。</p>
<p>丙、蔬菜類、新鮮之绿豌豆，黄芽菜，捲心菜等。</p>
<p>丁、菓類、花生，榛實，乾杏仁，甜杏仁，風乾核桃。</p>
<p>二、富含脂肪者</p>
<p>動物類、甲、肉類，各種鮮肥者，脂肪，骨髓。</p>
<p>乙、魚類、鮭魚，鰲魚之魚肝，　魚。（未完）</p>

<h3>全世界金之儲蓄量</h3>
<p>— 胡一臧譯</p>
<p>美法兩國爲世界冠</p>
<p>東京時事新報云、近年來世界不景氣，逐年深刻、推其所以致之者、卽金之偏在一方故也、雖去年對於金之潮流、略有變動、然由大勢觀之、世界金之集中地、仍在美法二國、蓋世界五大國自去秋以還、對於金之保有額與通貨流通額、以平價換算之、約如下表、</p>
<p>一九三一年年末　一九三二年年末</p>
<p>金保有量　美　八、九一六　八、五七六法　四、二八六　六、六六二英　一、二一○　一、二一○日　四七○　四二五德　一、一○八　四○○通貨流通額　美　一一、二六六　一一四六○法　六、○三五　六、五六三英　三、六四○　三、七○○日　一、一五九　一、二三三德　二、一三八　一、七○○</p>
<p>自一九三二年、因支付戰債、金之流動、達一億元、一方法國因國内政變、金融界發生動搖、金之保有量不免有减少之傾向、但照去年年底計算、達八百三十三億、竟比前年增加八成五分、英國自金本位停止後、曾减少一億二千萬鎊、而去年年底回復一億四千萬鎊、但去年十二月十五日支拂戰債年賦金約二千萬鎊、德國現在之保有量、爲公億九千九百萬馬克、且因匯兌管理金之流出海外不絶，日本自金本位停止後、亦激减四千萬元、故美法二國之儲蓄量仍爲全世界之冠云、</p>
<h3>現代統制經濟之意義</h3>
<p>— 高晋原</p>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>經濟的目的、本來是促進和平安定一般國民生活的、但最近的經濟狀態、不但不能安定一般國民的生活、而且使一般國民陷於貧困的苦境、自從一九二九年以來、世界各國經濟、已呈恐慌現象、直至今日、已經到了山窮水盡的地步、商品停滞、工塲倒閉、大批的工人、相繼失業、多數的國民、陷於悲境、國家减少了財政的收入、社會充滿了不安的景象、於是各國政府當局及大部分的學者間、爲突破目前經濟恐慌的難關起見、爲救濟一般民衆的生活起見、乃主張統制經濟、以企圖挽回危機、裨益人財、所謂統制經濟的主張、便是限制資本主義的自由放任的經濟、而企圖大資本的利益、附屬於全體民衆之利益的主張、</p>
<p>統制經濟的主張、最近已極盛行、遍布世界、一般主張統制經濟者、便　爲這個是一劑打關世界不景氣的良藥、這是一種救濟農村及中小商工業的根本策略、</p>
<p>吾人平心而論、統制經濟、的確是一個挽回經濟危機及拯救民衆經濟生活的　　的方法、並且牠還企圖根本改革經濟的組織、使生產與消費、得到均衡的地位、</p>
<p>（二）什麽呌做統制經濟</p>
<p>關於統制經濟　、吾人現在作一個簡單　的解釋如下、</p>
<p>㈠統制經濟是一種被竊束的經濟、牠同自由經濟、處於對立的地位、如正統學派、丨尤其亞丹斯密極力主張自由放任經濟、但他們的主張、在今日的經濟情形下，已經走不通了、所以對抗這種思想的人爲的竊束的經濟、便是統制經濟、</p>
<p>㈡統制經濟、是預定一個計劃的經濟、並不是無目的人爲的規則的經濟、卽是先計劃某一經濟領域内的消費、以圖調節生產、而適合於消費、這就是以一個計劃爲前提的經濟、依此計劃、則可確定各種經濟的需給關係、所謂計劃經濟、便含有調節生產與消費的意義、</p>
<p>㈢統制經濟卽是國家規制的經濟、其統制的主體、便是國家、在這個塲合、把牠看做成超赿國家的全世界的統制經濟、亦無不可、但在現在的情形下、像這種觀念、恐怕近於理想、故以國家爲單位、比較有實現的可能、現今把國家當做最公正的統制主體、吾人相信也沒有什麽異議的、所以在一個企業内部實行的各企業之結合乃至合同的縱横的統制關係、應該列於統制經濟的觀念之外、</p>
<p>照這様看來、所謂統制經濟、便是國家依據某經濟領域的需給計劃而　束的經濟制度、</p>
<p>（三）統制經濟的目的</p>
<p>統制經濟最初着手的緊急事項、約有數種、卽人類經濟不平等的改革、經濟不景氣的打開、一般失業者的救濟、病態產業的整理等問題、</p>
<p>㈠人類經濟不平等的改革</p>
<p>統制經濟的第一個目的、便是在除掉人類經濟不平等的緣因、因爲現在經濟在組織下之自由競爭主義的經濟、必定使一部分的人、富有財產千萬使一部分的人、陷窮困之境、故統制經濟的第一個目的、就是籍國家的權力、以改革人類社會之自然的經濟條件的不平等、而拯救貧苦的人民、所以統制經濟、可謂調和生產與消費的一個很好的方法、</p>
<p>㈡經濟不景氣的打開</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌的原因、固有種種、而其主要的、則不外機械設備的擴大、金融機關的遍在、心理的原因及商業組織的缺陷等、所謂商品價格、變動無常、雖批發的物價低廉、而零售的物價、仍然沒有减少、又批發物價的變動、須有相當時間、才能够影響於金融方面、加以大戰後世界物價、一時起了低下的運動、這様、現代商業組織中最困難的、莫過於需要的减退、需要一减退、卽是失業問題及購實力的减少之表徵、因此、一般產業界便受莫大的影響、故現代各國政府及各學者間、極力主張統制經濟、卽爲解决這個問題、總之、現代一般農民及中小工商業者的窮困、生產業者的悲鳴、繼續的失業與購買力的减少、的確可説是現代急宜解决的重要問題、</p>
<p>、㈢衰弱產業的整理</p>
<p>衰弱產業不振的根本原因、便是因爲某產業的生產能力、在相對的或絶對的過大時而發生出來的、又無能力的及生產費昂貴的生產企業之存在、也是衰弱產業不振的一個原因、而統制經濟、就是站在國家的立塲、務必要統制這些生產能力過大的生產、並須統一與整理那些衰弱的產業、所有農村問題及中小工商業問題、均包含在内、</p>
<p>㈣一般失業者的救濟</p>
<p>失業的原因、究竟在什麽地方、據一般人觀察、十有八九是因機械生產的發達而不用勞働力的結果、這些勞働者、旣陷於失業狀態、則他們便缺乏購買能力、而他們的欲求、便不能表現爲市塲需要的形式了、所謂生產、就是以市塲需要爲目標的、故在這個時候、生產亦陷於不能利用失業者的將態、所以現在必須集中力量、吸收失業者、以振興生產品新的需要、對於這種新的需要而實行生產、則由生產事業、以吸收失業者、並增大其購買能力現在一般資本家都想避免過剩生產、但對於需要、而又不能作一種適當的生產、如從失業問題的立塲看來、真可謂最悲慘的一　事情、　　㈣結語</p>
<p>現在爲一人一圑體一事業的利益而統制化的經濟、並不是真正的統制經濟、如一事業的生產限制、販賣價格的恊定、競爭的休止、同業者的企業集中化、企業的卡忒爾Ｃａｒｔｅｌ化等、都是有、利益於個人、公司資本家及同一事業者等的經濟運動、而决不是統制經濟運動、像這個經濟運動、是負有統制經濟之美名的一個人一公司一同業者等的利益擁護運動、而確不是統制經濟、所調統制經濟、完全是着眼於國民經濟的全體上的、這綫呌做統制經濟、所以從國民經濟全體上看來、如果某一事業有損害的時候、則其經濟政策、亦有偉大的統制經濟運動、簡單的說、統制經濟、並不是着眼於一個人一公司及一事業的、縱令某一事業某一公司有損害的時候、畢竟還是不能不從一國國民經濟的立塲而樹立一個方針、總括說來、統制經濟的目標、就是建築於一國國民經濟的全體上的、</p>

<h3>糖市粗砂白又小五分</h3>
<p>刁靑地價雖升······進意殊淡</p>
<p>昨糖市以走塲沉寂、趨勢依然平疲、公會划盤二四粗砂白划十五兩七錢半、比前日又小五分、成交不多、八號荷赤划十二兩三錢、九號十二兩半、比前均小錢許、十號貨稀、仍要十二兩七錢、號盤有潮帮開出中莊半南靑百數十包、價爲八兩四錢半至五錢、汕頭帮開出普通片靑百數包、價爲八兩、惟貨底確已稀薄、故後盤呌八兩二三錢、高貨八兩六錢、尚未成交、建帮續開刁靑數十包、價九兩五錢半、據漳州電訊、地價轉升、但申市各行進意殊淡、况值結束期近、已乏轉好望、</p>
<h3>國產靑糖之應改良處廉</h3>
<p>自從上年洋糖稅率增高以來、吾國閩廣產糖之區、確已從事於生產擴充、邇來潮靑到數日增、及　刁之踵至、可以想見矣、顧本届所來潮靑、高貨固有、次貨實居多數、致銷塲未能占勝、果能於質地方面、設法使其純凈、不　雜質、則成糖後不致有砂脚、再能於煮糖汁時、務使火候適中、水份减少、則成糖後必身乾而色佳、而業中人又能時存增高國糖地位之想、處處加以研究改良、則不難遂洋糖而恢復其地位矣、</p>
<p>本届漳州所產刁靑、出新以來、前後到貨尚未見湧、惟聞產額確已增多、非往年可比、而貨品反較前遜色、此無可諱言者也、慈將其亟應改良要點、述之如下、</p>
<p>、（一）［身份］從前刁靑、以身乾色黄者爲多、現則反之、其原因由於產地貨主貪圖重量、增其進益、不將水份去盡所致、須知幸勿貪圖目前一時之利益、自伍於淘汰之列、</p>
<p>（二）糖核卽糖之塊粒、查本届刁靑次者糖核多而且大、其原因係由於身潮製作不佳所致、不特形式難看、實爲表示其糖質次劣之特徵、苟不早自改良、則不但難與洋糖爭勝、且不能與潮靑並駕也、</p>

<h3>師徒（一）</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>叮叮；師父赤着膊，兩條胳膊上的筋肉全绷得緊緊瓣，骼勁兒在打着那新從　　取出來的沸紅的　！　支支的響，火星濺得老遠，師父就　用勁打，像有滿心　的鬰怒全　托到那個　子上似的！咱在一邊拉風箱一邊摸摸自家脚上昨兒給師父打起的一大塊腫！覺得指頭上　膩的像有濃血淋漓的在爛着，想着近來師父的脾氣突然變到這様凶暴！一轉念頭又想到［走］；</p>
<p>走！走那裏去？回家嗎？爸爸的眼珠子準睜得像銅鈴大，聲音像　　獅吼；</p>
<p>［我說過的！你這畜生；咱們家裏沒飯養活你！一條麻繩；一把刀！］</p>
<p>媽媽氣得渾身全發抖，又是那麽柔心腸兒的流着淚，手指到我鼻尖，語音也就斷續的！</p>
<p>［你···你···你這不爭氣的東西·····連個鐵匠也學不成！·····招·····招人呌回湯豆腐干！］</p>
<p>依着媽爭口氣吧！學滿了回去該是體面的事！但近來這様天天挨餓！天天挨師父打！天天又得爲想師妹傷心！自家兒又忍不得！</p>
<p>不知怎的，咱心裏一酸，淚珠兒吊下來呢！</p>
<p>［你爺老子沒死！好好的哭你媽！在這裏活不耐煩！滾你的！］師父順手又是一鐵鎚，打上咱的脊骨蓋上，咱的心像一塊鐵！隨着這一鎚拼出了火星！準走！幹麽老是那麽婆婆媽媽的柔勁兒耐！全沒一點男兒漢的剛强氣分！娘老子不要咱回家：咱就一個身子在外面滿山滿野　！或是挨門逐户的求討些也度了日！但想呀，·····又想起師妹哩；丨丨那様一張圓圓的小臉兒，兩片嫩頰上嵌進兩個小圓圈兒！一對眼珠子像黑夜裏的兩顆明星，直照透了人心窩裏的黑　·····等着吧！師妹會有一天仍回來，自家兒的心又軟下來呢！</p>
<p>夢似的想開了：</p>
<p>幾月前的一天！</p>
<p>師父坐在板橙上唱白干兒，咱和師妹在廚下給師父燒菜，咱要師妹燒火，自家兒上灶，師妹堵着　不依，兩口兒噪起來，給師父聽見了。</p>
<p>［好好的又噪什麽！阿珍：讓大毛上灶，你燒火！忘記了你媽死的那年，家裏窮到一顆米也沒有，你掛着眼淚去　野菜吃的時候呀！現在有吃有穿的！别太開心了！］（未完）</p>
<h3>十年後（四）</h3>
<p>— 莫及</p>
<p>是一個長吻。但我感到冰冷。那香氣是被人揉躪過的！</p>
<p>［還有，］她底朱唇離開了我底，又説，［倘使將來我被勇敢的戰士們戮死了，那末請你爲我雕造一尊雕像，放在你底案頭，以紀念我你過去了底靑春！現在請你可走了，前線鬥爭着底同伴們在等你去參加！］</p>
<p>她把我推開了丨丨丨從她底懐中把我推開了。</p>
<p>［這就是你給我底新的力量嗎，姑娘？］我問。</p>
<p>［是的。］她點點頭。</p>
<p>［那末再會了丨丨丨將來再會，迎兒姑娘！］</p>
<p>［將來······最近的將來再會！］她站起來。</p>
<p>我出了她底臥房，在門口我們握了手，并且我吻了她底。</p>
<p>東方已射出微紅美麗的陽光來，照耀着我向前程奔跑！（完）</p>
<h3>學乖</h3>
<p>— 招勉之</p>
<p>吃一回虧，學一次乖，廢科舉，辦學校，立憲政，振興實業，訓練新軍，建立共和，打倒軍閥　······都算是我們學乖了的對策，有無好果且不去計較。近來又輪到［理科救國］的時代了。在許多新式機械中，我們尤需要飛機，於是［航空救國］乃成爲一句切中時要的一乘標語］。</p>
<p>飛機，我們不是沒有，單説東三省九一八之變，也給日本軍隊搶去了二三百架。談空戰，也並非毫無建樹，過去的我們且不説，一二八以後，陳濟棠將軍曾用飛機在瓊州海口炸沉飛鷹。韓復榘將軍平魯東，也用過飛機去張一回聲勢。雖説當時馬占山蘇炳文等在東北受盡了日本飛機的威嚇，並沒有半架飛機去帮帮他們的忙。不錯，飛機是很有用處，蘇俄用來給農民撤種子，我們用來炸飛鷹，日本軍隊用來侵略中國。飛機是一件利器，如像新式的武器與軍隊一様可以用來做［好］，也可以用來做［歹］的。</p>
<p>真正想學乖，應該注意到用來［做好］。</p>
<p>譬如，我們練軍隊已練了幾十年，人數的確也不少，但用來用去都是自己打自己，這様便不如沒有的好。一旦飛機多了，又是那麽様，説不定，反使民衆又多一重災難。</p>
<p>大家不要誤會，航空，確是目前救國的一條路，我並不是反對航空，我的希望是在於用飛機來做好這一點，不要把牠變作一架架的私家飛機。因爲經騐告訴我們，私家的東西總是勇於爲私人服務的多。馬占山蔡廷楷將軍抗日時缺少炸飛鷹船的飛機，就是一個例</p>
<h3>蕭伯訥與飛機</h3>
<p>— 老蘇</p>
<p>愛爾蘭的大戲劇家蕭伯訥氏，真是老而益壯，已經是七十多歲了，還是東奔西走的孜孜不倦，去春游了南斐歸去，現在又在開始作漫游全世界的壯舉了。據日前電訊，蕭氏下月十七即可到達中國，而且據説，他到中國之後，還要乘一回飛機去拜訪那著名的萬里長城呢。</p>
<p>這位世界所共仰望的老文毫，誰都知道他是一位俏皮的老頭子，他有一張會説的嘴巴，説出來的總是針針見血令人啼笑皆非。最近他居然説菲洲的土人優於白種人，這是會使那［殿堂的歐洲］中的［白色紳士］老不高興的。</p>
<p>三年前，他的老友迫朗凱特卿，一位七十六歲的愛爾蘭老政治家，忽然老興勃發，天天到步爾姆朗特的飛機塲去學習開飛機，蕭氏因他這様的高興，便［幽默］地對他説道：［像老兄這様的年紀，學習開飛機，總算是一種冒險的快事。但我想，若要自殺的話，那末别的靠得住的法子還多着呢。］</p>
<p>今年蕭氏偕其夫人游南菲的時候，在開浦城那裏，居然也學起時髦，坐了一回飛機。這破例兒第一遭的空中旅行，使這位孤高猖　的老文豪，嘆爲七十五歲以來第一剌激事，三年前的［靠不住的自殺］，三年後一變而爲生平第一剌激事；那老政治家迫朗凱特卿當可以説[我道不孤］了。</p>
<p>蕭氏來中國之後，不管他對於中國的印象如何，可是我們一定能聽見他從那小鬍子縫裏吐出熱辣辣的話來。而且，當他去游覧雄偉的萬里長城時，這老文豪乘着［靠不住的自殺］號，飛翔在日本滿裝着瓦斯，炸彈的［殺人］號羣内，我想，他一定會感到飛機於自殺雖靠不住，而於殺人，則是很靠得住罷。</p>
<h3>寄故人</h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍女士</p>
<p>娥···</p>
<p>咱們分手了是不是五個年頭呢？我簡直忘了你是比我先離平幾多時，更忘了是在什麽時候，咱們間的消息便像斷線的紙鳶一様，從此杳然。風沒吹，雨沒打，可是我們的友情便散得像落花！　　娥，懂了人事以後的回憶是辛酸的，只有小兒時的情景是深鏤在心頭，那種回憶才是寸寸皆甜蜜的。南來五載，不時地碰見也曾旅居塞北的歸來客，促膝相對，談及北地風光時，常是喜歡得流淚！［他鄕話舊］，此中情趣我已切實感到。雖然北平不是我的故鄕，但我是永永不能忙懐於北平的。</p>
<p>你該已升大學了吧，不爲了病，我不也和你一様？但我也得深自慶幸，使我慢着點兒受折磨，在如今的貴族式的敎育制度之下，要踏進大學的高門檻是不容易的喲！我躊躇着，不知掙扎好還是由着它我的運命？這動盪的時代啊！貧窮的人是多麽可憐地被它作成了俘虜，翻身的日子在幾時？我望着灰色的天，暗暗地嘘氣。生活對於我也不是享樂不是遊戲，只是一種壓迫。我張開臂仰天巡迴，我要找出一個魔鬼，牠是曾殘酷地殺害了許多弱者，把他們抛在大海裏無踪無影，只漂着他們的慘呌的聲音，隨着那點點微波。</p>
<p>幾年來生活的經騐苦壞了我，在矛盾中生活過來，自己知道是變成了個多麽不健全的人！這是説在心靈方面我是受着巨痛，成了個心的不健全者。我始終是剛直地勇敢地在掙扎，但感情依然是如火如茶地在我心頭燃燒。我像是站在晨風中的山巔一様，覺得清冷幽怡，但時代的火花可又在我眼前細碎地擴展。我願意站在時代的前面，努力地向前征，但沒人告訴我那是爲着什麽來！真的，沒人能告訴。這不是笑話嗎？可别笑我，娥，你該知道小彭的心是貧弱得這麽利害。你鼓勵我，讓我果毅一點，大胆地正直地在人生的征途中搖旗呐喊，我的口號是充實我們的生活！我們要自覺，我們要活活潑潑！</p>
<p>平中舊友有幾個人通信？想不到當時的熱閙情形到如今竟飄零到這様！也許，在十年八年之後會在征途中相遇的，到那時笑顏相對，各自訴自己的故事那味兒夠多美麗。</p>
<p>你的兒侶，</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路（續稿）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>海泉拿着毛巾和牙刷向門首走來，剛走到樓梯口，又碰見了那個日本佬。海泉看見他的怪様子，幾乎要笑要聲了。因爲這個日本人，今天完全換上了一套中國的衣服，在頭上還戴着一頂有紅結子的瓜皮帽兒。他看見海泉又禮躬籌然地深深地鞠了一躬。海泉不得己也回了一個禮。海泉想，一定有古怪，怎麽這個日本佬假裝起中國人來了。</p>
<p>［林先生，請半天假也可以？下半天陪我們去看電影好麽］？</p>
<p>鶴子夫人跟着他走到浴室門首來。他在裏面洗潄，她就立在門邊，好像不願意離開他。娘姨提着一壺熱水上來，她也不假手娘姨，把熱水壺接了過去，替海泉倒進磁盆裏去。她像故意地緊擠近他的身邊來。他聞着了一陣從未領　過的，會使人麻醉般的香氣，他的心房又震動起來了。</p>
<p>［索性請一天假。陪她出去走一天看看吧］。</p>
<p>到了這時候，他無論如何不能否定自己對於她的戀慕了。因爲從日本新來的闖入者，妨礙了他倆有一個多星期不能接近了。他是十二分想伴着她到無人過問他倆的，幽寂的地方去痛快地遊散一天，以補償近數日來的踈隔。</p>
<p>（十九）</p>
<p>海泉洗潄過了，一個人走回二樓上的房裏來。他以爲鶴子夫人也一定會跟着來。但是坐在書桌前，翻看了一會今早晨的報紙，還不見她上來。</p>
<p>他雖然在翻看報紙。但報章裏載了些什麽消息，他一點也沒有感覺。他只看見有許多要人的名字，丨丨丨蔣介石，馮玉祥，阎錫山，張學良，李濟　等，丨丨丨在報紙面上跳舞，有的是跳狐步舞，有的有跳華兒子，有的是跳布魯斯，跳來跳去，都是老調子。於是他把報紙一　，不願意再看了。他想重新審查一下自己對於鶴子夫人的感情。</p>

<h3>說夢</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>夢，原來是極其平凡的東西，誰都有着做夢的本領，雖然睡在衖堂的討飯婆所做的夢，不見得比委員太太的甜夢更爲完美，但是她在夢中僥倖的也吃飽了一頓陽春白麵，却也值得相當歡喜吧。所以夢也者，究竟不壞，所以，前古的聖賢大哲以及今世的正人君子，都願意做着好夢，在夢裏追求他所追求的一切。</p>
<p>譬如多情而又正走着桃花運的大少爺，他所希望的是甜蜜的夢，願意在華貴的旅館中擁抱着自己的情人，親吻着千回萬遍。賣花生米的小商人夢見在某一汽車旁邊拾着一束鈔票，居然度過了陰曆年關。商店裏的小店員夢見中着三十九萬的頭獎。道學先生夢見日帝國主義大發天良自動退出東北，並且其他列强亦賭咒不瓜分中國，愛國的小科員夢見政府已下令動員，實行武力抵抗。持齋念佛的老善士夢見活佛果然感動玉皇大帝，普渡衆生。</p>
<p>然而這都是平凡人的平凡夢想，也許是卑卑不足道者，至於有大抱負的大人物，他們所做的夢，當然是大而又大了。譬如手握重兵的大元帥，他所希望的是和替天行道的及時雨宋公明一様夢得九天玄女的無字天書，從此能夠治國平天下，任是反兵如何佔着天時地利人和，也不能將他的虎皮寶座，移動半分三毫。萬一匈奴興兵南下，只憑他一紙降書，免不了仍是開國元勛。</p>
<p>次之如風流諸候者流，當然，其夢也仍不失其風流本色。諸如冦已入關，自知骨瘦如柴，那能抵擋得住坦克飛機毒砲，雖有［短槍］［黑泡］亦不中用，所以到不如再事風流，大做其蝴蝶美夢。</p>
<p>所以，夢之不同，正如其人。而且當這天下昇平，五榖豐登，百業茂盛之時，我們豐衣足食的老百姓們，正好各尋好夢，萬一大夢醒來，萬事皆空，且待那時痛哭一塲罷。</p>

<h3>一隻價廉物美的滅火機</h3>
<p>— 工</p>
<p>火是最可怕的東西，一不留心，便要闖出亂子來，所以平常大家都備只滅火機，來預防他，現在這篇内所講的，是一只價錢很賤而又很有效的滅火機，所用的材料，祗有一只空瓶和瓶蓋（汽水）瓶很適合），還有平常吃的醋和蘇打罷了，至於做的一方面，也很簡單，起先拿平常吃的濃醋，和水兩份相混合，一同倒入空瓶中，約到瓶的四分之三的地方爲止，然後拿蘇打，包在容易着潮的紙頭裏，好像中國的毛邊紙等，再用一根綫，一頭札住這包蘇打，一頭從瓶蓋上已經鑽的小空中抽出來，讓這包蘇打不碰着醋爲止，這様一來後，立刻就把火漆或類似的東西，把這根線頭，封住在蓋上，使他不能下去而掛這包蘇打在瓶空中，這様後，一只輕而易舉的滅火機便成功了，用的時候，祗要拿瓶搖幾搖，使醋碰到紙上，紙頭因爲受到濕的緣故，便載不住蘇打的重而穿了，因之蘇打便跌到醋内，但醋和蘇打，是有化學作用的，在這個化學變化當中，有大量的氣發生，這大量的氣，便拿封小洞的東西衝開，而包圍火燒體的四周，因之火燒，爲着得不到養氣供給的緣故，而被撲滅了，</p>

<h3>大學秘聞</h3>
<p>— 羣</p>
<p>校長親自監考的怪劇</p>
<p>校長親自監考的消息，由每個敎授的口中無意間透出來，驚動了有方帽子希望的大學士。</p>
<p>××大學，上海人目光中是呌做野鷄大學，對於學生向取放任主義，祗要你們繳足了三費丨丨學費，膳費，宿費，除了不能带女人到學校裏來玩之外，餘的悉隨尊便，　於敎室中倩同學代等舉動，那是和吃飯之後要大便一様的普通。所以　請敎授，名義上雖是鍍金鍍銀的Ｘ士，實際，還得到小學去聽幾年講，但是他們有超等的本領，使他們的衣食父母的學生，不致發生毆打，驅逐等，無理取閙；况且他們都是校長的親戚，校長密告他們，對於學生，僅可博他們歡心，不可使他們懊怒，今則大違於生財之直。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>起初開辦之後，每年確可以打上二十分利息，校長已討上了二房小老婆，鍍金等Ｘ士也脫去了藍布長衫，換上暉嘰西裝。但是天下事要使人不知，除非己莫爲，野鷄大學名聞遐邇以來，賣買頓時减少。做天下父母的心理，總希望兒子好好讀書，將來做官發財。野鷄大學拆穿了西洋鏡，已不值一分錢，所以近兩學期來，出入於學院門口者，僅僅幾個公子哥兒而已。校長有鑑於期，想恢復從前初開時的名譽，召集一個校務會議，經他們秘密討論之後，從每個敎授口中，慢慢的　　校長親自監考的消　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　不小，自從進校以來，沒有見過校長的面長面短，旣說親自監考，總比這幾個敎授難講話。於是上焉者點了臘燭開夜車，下焉才對於夾带一門，精求益精。</p>
<p>考試開始，果然校長戴了墨精眼鏡，巍巍乎的坐着監考，但是不滿五分鐘，門房授進一張卡片來，校長就躬迎那位貴客去了，而且一去兮不復返。一連兩日，都是抄老文章，未來的學士們當然都是聰明絶頂的天才，知道校長親自監考的味道不過如此，第三天起再不見開夜車的傻子了。考試時，校長會客去後，課室中照様紙圑亂飛，派司震瓦。兩位敎授右腿架了左腿，看他們的當天報紙，或者説避去未來學士的視線。</p>
<p>一幕校務會議，秘密討論的怪劇，給未來學士們不少談話資料。至於能不能照校長務斷的恢復從前的名譽，記者無從知道了。朋友告訴我這故事，姑記之，愽讀者一粲。</p>
<h3>嘗試</h3>
<p>— 振年</p>
<p>天氣顯然冷得可怕，窗外已佈滿了白的雪景。</p>
<p>守着爐子，擁着美妾，在高大的洋房裏，欣賞這一歲難逢的雪景，當然使人羨慕··但拿乾薪水的我，是不能不踏着雪街，冒着寒風，到公司裏去的。</p>
<p>里門口常有十多輛黄包車停着，平時我出來不會來理我，今天却蜂擁上來圍住了我。我是坐電車買有月季票，而且覺得我也沒有資格呌另外一個人替我跑路，我仍是突圍而出，維持我一向的主張。</p>
<p>走不上二十步，一個車夫在後面大聲的喊，拉着車子追上來，我停住了聽他的話。</p>
<p>［先生，坐車去罷丨我還餓着肚子呢·］</p>
<p>一個年約四十歲的江北人，乾黄色的臉，長亂的頭髪，沒有帽子，他沒有避雪的外衣；一隻脚是舊布鞋，一隻脚是破套鞋，用一根繩子紮着；在我面前索索的抖着，說話在打戰。</p>
<p>［得坐上去，救救他·］想着跳上車。</p>
<p>［車輪在滑的冰上，冷的雪上，濕的柏油路上滑着。</p>
<p>車夫的兩隻脚，一步又一步，也在那滑的冰上，冷的雪上，濕的柏油路上滑着。一陣尖冷的風從馬路口上横飛過來，車夫狠命的對着衝上去，我在車上透一過氣來。</p>
<p>車夫的口角裏埀着口涎，噴出來一口一口的熱氣，像乏力的老騾抱着沉重的貨車。</p>
<p>老騾想息足，騾夫用力的鞭着丨這車夫也在想息足，我坐在上面無形中在鞭着他。我惶愧起來了。我爲援助他才坐他的車，而現在我在虐待他，奴使他，威逼也，在要他的命。</p>
<p>［他還是餓着肚子在爲我拉呢丨］我直想半途跳下來，我真太殘酷了。我在深深的懺悔，爲什麽我不給他幾個錢，定要坐他的車呢？丨我有電車的月季票。</p>
<p>又是一陣尖冷風吹到車上來，我捲縮着不敢動。</p>
<p>到了公司門口，我趕忙的跳下來，不自主的給了二倍的錢。他揩了揩臉上的汗滿意的説：</p>
<p>［謝謝，明天再來候你·］</p>
<p>我聽了心裏寛鬆些，拔脚走進公司大門，但我再不想坐黄包車了，無論雪下的多麽大，天氣是多麽冷，我仍將坐我的電車去。　一，十四，</p>

<h3>婚姻問題</h3>
<p>大錯已鑄後的補救</p>
<p>編者先生：：</p>
<p>我是　山縣羅店鎭人，父親是一個商人，家裏平平。我受過八年學校敎育，由小學一直到縣師一年級。前年家父認爲商業較有希望，令我到上海某洋貨號習業：經［一二八］淞滬事變，略受影響，但尚可立足。</p>
<p>當我在寶山縣師肄業的時候，認識了一位Ａ女士：我們雖則同學不久，但是彼此情投意合，所以就私下裏訂定婚約，不料去年八月，家父作主，在本鄕又給我另外訂了個Ｂ女士：事前並未來信通知，僅於事後來問我結婚的日子。我接到了上面的消息，很覺左右爲難。允許了罷？那末怎様對得起Ａ女士！不答應罷；豈非要使家父爲難：不孝之罪，又安能辭！因此日夜焦慮，至今不知所可。</p>

<p>編者按：潘君這件事，一誤於與Ａ女士私行訂婚的時候，未曾徵求家長同意；倘使當時曾經禀明，那末潘君的父親，又何至於再代爲訂Ｂ女士呢：須知『未成年之男女，訂定婚約，應得法定代理人之同意，』是民法九百七十四條所規定的。並且再誤於他父親代爲訂定Ｂ女士前，也沒有徵求潘君的意思，僅於事後通知潘君，致使潘君毫無說話的機會：這也與民法九百七十二條規定［婚約應由男女當事人自行訂定］的原則不符。基上論斷，豈不是這兩起婚約，根本均不能成立：潘君儘可隨心所擇了罷？這却又不然！因爲拒絶Ａ女士，固屬情何以堪：即使拒絶Ｂ女士，那末使善意第三者的Ａ女士受有損害，在道德上，在法律上，均負相當責任：而且其首當衛的，是潘君的父親：真如潘君所謂［不孝之罪又安能辭］呢！所以這件事，根本大錯已鑄，爲今之計，只有設法彌補：實在沒有直捷了當的辦法呀。</p>
<p>我們以爲潘君應首先調查Ｂ女士的品性學問，倘若相差太遠，絶對不能做我終身伴侶時，那末應當根據民法九百七十二條的規定，堅决反對，這是爲終身幸福計，不得不爾：並不是單爲要成全與Ａ女士的婚約呀。假使Ｂ女士的品性學問，尚屬相當，那末不妨向Ａ女士和盤托出，要求取消前約，永久做一個朋友，看他態度如何，再定方針。據我們推測，Ａ女士的態度，終不出下列四種。㈠因爲自己還繼續着讀書，對於業已習商的潘君，已經發生鄙視，聞潘君言，樂於從命。㈡當訂婚時，也許同様未曾徵求家長同意，目下與潘君同様有說不出的苦衷，聞潘君言，樂於相從。（三）聞潘君，認爲潘君對他的愛情，已經搖動，因失望與怨恨而許可。㈣情真意實，大有非潘郎不嫁之慨。倘使Ａ女士的態度，屬於第一種時，那末潘君可竟與之絶：連友誼的關係，也無保存的必要。如其爲第二種時，那末只可忍痛割絶，以兩全其美：至於以後的友誼關係，須視雙方日後環境再定。若爲第三種時，那末Ａ女士的情意，雖則可感，但其愛情，也非絶對不能動搖，舍之亦尚不可惜：暫時的創痕，日久自可消滅，充其量，可延遲自己的婚期，直到Ａ女士結婚之後爲止，那就可以問心無愧了。但是一旦Ａ女士的態度屬於第四種時，那末Ａ女士的人格，Ａ女士的情意，至高無上：生何幸而能得此等女子爲伴侶。爲個人幸福計，當然無舍此就彼之理，自以拒絶Ｂ女士爲上策。即使累及父親爲難，也就顧不得許多了。何况一個素不相識的Ｂ女士　在這　道德　　　潰的時候，怕也不致十分爲難呢。</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>賈克古柏還不過是一個九歲光景的孩子，但他對於種種頑皮及冒險的情狀；却勝乎平常孩子，雖然，日間打架，喧閙，晚間早睡，這是通常孩子所不免的情形，但他雖是個孩子，却喜和大人們踼球，駕汽車，作種種大膽冒險的游戲，當他在攝影塲空暇之後，他老是喜歡拆弄東西。</p>
<p>他在小童班中，可算最活潑。他的薪水，是每年一萬三千金元，他母親是很鍾愛他的，不過，有時他頑皮過份的當兒，也要責打幾下的，據他母親的話；他有一次，賈克在會客室裏踼球，不意竟把他祖母三十年前的古花瓶；打碎了，可是，待他祖母趕至，他早已卸去了衣服，準備着他祖母的責打，並且他聲言，願將他所有薪水，全數賠償這古花瓶！</p>
<p>他的父親是不幸在他二歲時即故世的，所以他父親的面目幾乎記不起來了。但，他目睹别的孩子有父親的體貼，他不由一個人在房裏祈禱着［［别的孩子都有父親，爲什麽我沒有，·········］］而他的母親聽了，因此也爲他流了不少的熱淚，</p>

<p>我生長在紐約的勃洛克林（Ｂｒｏｏｋｌｙｎ）我的生日是七月二十九日。</p>
<p>我在當地的中學讀書的時候，我愛和一般男生嬉耍。因爲我愛把頭髮弄得蓬着，他人都以爲很美觀，並且說我頗合宜於電影界。適巧布勒斯忒雜誌舉行銀幕競選，我的父親便把一切表格塡就，連同了我的照片寄了去。經過了好幾個星期，在該誌所發表的競選員中，竟沒有列入我，我以爲已經絶望，不料在某一天，我接到了一封信，是該誌競選的三位裁判具名的，要舉行面試。</p>
<p>面試的一天，一起約有着十餘個女子。過了一星期，我竟榮獲首選。那時的快樂，真是無可形容，我自己以爲是一個電影明星了。</p>
<p>到了好萊塢，意倫諾葛林（ＥｌｉｎｏｒＧｌＹｎ）很賞識我，即呌我擔任［異性熱力］的主角。</p>
<p>我演着［異性熱力］，而［異性熱力］使我做了明星。而最近的一張［野性］（ＣａｌｌＨｅｒＳｎｖａｇｅ），是我加入福克司公司的第一張作品。</p>
<p>我最心愛的是許多影迷寫給我的信，我常把這許多信珍藏着。人們都愛探詢我心愛的顏色，我最愛的顏色是絲和紅。</p>

<p>我離不了愛情，我覺得愛情在人生是一種很真實的事物。我很快樂，因爲我找到一個丈夫像李克貝爾那様的。</p>
<h3>明星踪跡不明</h3>
<p>— 森</p>
<p>沒有人理睬，固然不好，但是巴結的人太多了，疲於應付，也是苦事。中國的要人，因怕被新聞記者包圍，常是踪跡不明。想不到好萊塢的明星居然也不得不踪跡不明，因爲她們或他們雖沒有新聞可供給，却有許多的電影熱要麻煩她們或他們，留些手澤以爲榮哩。</p>
<p>很多很多的靑年，甚至小孩子，常是成羣的候在什麽地方，等待所崇拜的明星從什麽館子裏或咖啡室裏出來，以便要求那明星留一個字跡在他們捧着的小册子裏。要應付這許多要求，並且那要求到什麽時候才能完全償清，又不得而知，在無論何人，確是夠麻煩的了。</p>
<p>因此，大明星的日常工作之一，是如何使自己變成［踪跡不明］。很有許多應酬不能不週旋，日常的用品又非自己親買不能稱心，這様是不能永遠躱在家裏，就不得不求救於化裝術了。那手續也非常簡單，因爲太麻煩了，就得不償失啦。最普通的是，出外時就戴上一副墨色眼鏡。如果是某明星，除戴眼鏡之外，有時裝些假鬚，也是很普通的。換一套自己平日不大穿的衣服，也是他們的慣技。曼琳苔曲麗出去時，常是換上一套男子格色的衣服，高跟皮鞋上面，罩上一條長脚管褲，頭上却又戴了女式帽。這種裝服在美國社會上原也流行的，但在曼琳，却是一種遮眼術哩。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Shimen Village, Using Tanks to Cover Infantry Assault; Our Troops Valiantly Resist, Enemy Fails; He Zhuguo Discusses Signs of Japanese Military Intending to Invade Westward</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The situation in Shihe is quiet, and Qinhuangdao is peaceful. This morning, the enemy, with more than ten tanks, launched an attack on Shimen Village under the cover of troops from Yuguan. Our troops retreated deliberately, luring the enemy deep, and dispatched troops from the left and right flanks to cut off the enemy's retreat route. Two tanks were destroyed, and two were captured. The enemy troops retreated in disarray. During the enemy's attack, five enemy aircraft circled and dropped bombs, but due to misjudging the target, they killed many enemy soldiers. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Linyu: The enemy's movements in the Yuguan area are extremely tense. Their mission is to cover the rear troops and concentrate them forward. Outside of Jiukou, a large enemy artillery unit arrived from Yuguan. This morning, two enemy aircraft scouted the area along Jiukou and Shimen Village, but did not drop bombs. The west bank of the Shihe River and the Qinhuangdao area are both quiet and uneventful. Enemy spies are densely deployed in the Qinhuangdao, Changli, Luanzhou, and Tangshan areas, specializing in probing our military situation. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At dawn on the 15th, the enemy, under the cover of artillery, launched a fierce attack on our Shimen Village position with six or seven hundred Japanese and puppet infantry and more than ten tanks as the vanguard. Our front-line troops, in order to lure the enemy deep, used heavy troops to outflank the enemy's rear from the left and right wings, launching a fierce pincer attack, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers, capturing some enemy tanks, and destroying one. At eight o'clock, five enemy aircraft dropped heavy bombs, mistakenly killing many retreating puppet troops. Later, our troops repelled them with anti-aircraft machine guns. As of ten o'clock this morning, the battle was still fierce. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Jiukou area, our troops are guarding Heishanwo and Shimen Village. Three trenches have been dug near Shimen Village, connecting with the Shihe River to form a general defense line. Last night, our troops built fortifications in Heishanwo, and the Japanese army used cavalry and puppet national plainclothes teams to disrupt them. This morning, more than 500 Japanese and puppet troops attacked Shimen Village, and another group moved towards Erlangmiao and Shahe Village, using aircraft to cover reconnaissance and bombing, making the situation tense. Our troops have increased their strength in Shimen Village, and the defenses are solid. The terrain from Jiukou to Heishanwo is险峻, and the enemy's tanks have lost their effectiveness. The most dangerous place inside Jiukou is Heishanwo, followed by Shimen Village. Now our troops have formed a parallel defense line with unified military communication, and they can quickly support each other. If the Japanese army attacks, they can be defended with the full strength of the entire line. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At Heishantou between Jiukou and Shimen Village, a combined enemy force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery launched a fierce attack on us, but was repelled by the cavalry of our Third Brigade. Last night, the enemy again drew elite troops from Yuguan and launched an attack on our garrison in Shimen Village along the Liujiang mining area railway, resulting in fierce fighting. The enemy forces were the Kimata detachment and the rebel Zhang Bi's special detachment. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Our side is also continuously调遣援军进扰. The situation in Shimen Village is becoming increasingly tense. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese army occupied Yuguan, they have been actively preparing for military action, plotting to advance towards the Rehe border. Three or four trains of baggage cars daily carry machinery, ammunition, and military supplies from outside the pass to Yuguan via the puppet Fengshan Railway, which are then transported to the Japanese barracks at the Fourth Fort and the Tian Family Primary School in the city. Japanese soldiers arriving from the Fengshan Railway to the Liaoxi and Rehe areas have reached three divisions, and rebel troops have also reached four to five thousand. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The two armies in Jiukou are still facing each other. Our front line is in Jiukou, and three or four Japanese aircraft fly from outside the Great Wall to our positions every day to scout and drop bombs. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy drew heavy artillery units from Jiaoshan and Erlangmiao to bombard Shimen Village. Our troops valiantly resisted, and the enemy did not succeed. Zhang Haipeng's 7th Mixed Brigade of rebels, led by the puppet brigade commander Zhang Ziqing, arrived at Qiansuo last night and will launch a large-scale attack on Shimen Village. Japanese troops outside Jiukou also opened fire at the same time, with unprecedented intensity. Qinhuangdao heard the sound of artillery fire all night, and residents all fled towards the Kailuan mining area. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Five Japanese warships are anchored off Tanggu, and rumors are rife. Last night, about 600 people came to Beiping and Tianjin via the Beining Railway to seek refuge. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In recent days, there have been minor skirmishes at the front of Shimen Village. The puppet national army is more active than the Japanese army. In the Yuguan area, the Japanese army's goal is east of the Luan River. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In Yuguan, there are very few Japanese troops stationed in the city in recent days, and there are almost no traces of Japanese troops in Nanguan. One or two artillery pieces have been built outside the South Gate, firing several times a day to show that the defenses are substantial. (15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Qinhuangdao is still tense. A Japanese warship docked at the Kailuan Pier this morning, intending to unload supplies and baggage ashore. The manager of the Kailuan Mining Bureau went to the British warship and asked the captain of the Kailai warship to negotiate with the Japanese army to stop it. The Japanese army then used small rowboats to unload at Dongxin River and gradually moved the supplies to the Japanese barracks. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The reason for the silence at the front in recent days is: (1) the Japanese army is preparing to continue advancing from Yuguan and is waiting for reinforcements; (2) the League of Nations is scheduled to meet tomorrow to observe the international attitude towards Japan. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There have only been minor skirmishes at the front today. Inside Jiukou, a unit of our cavalry is firmly defending the area. Due to the unsuccessful war, the enemy has increased its troops in Lijiapu significantly. At the front, a small unit of the puppet national army and plainclothes teams have repeatedly provoked our army with small flags. The defenses of the Shihe River are solid. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo stated that the Japanese army has signs of invading westward, attempting to pressure our army to withdraw to the Luan River, and then use heavy troops to capture Rehe. Therefore, the situation in Rehe is quite tense. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The battle in Shimen Village is very fierce. The Japanese drew heavy artillery units from Jiaoshan Temple and Erlangmiao to bombard Shimen Village with heavy artillery. Our troops valiantly resisted, and the enemy never succeeded. Zhang Haipeng's 7th Mixed Brigade of rebels, led by the puppet brigade commander Zhang Ziqing, arrived at Qiansuo on the 14th night and will launch a large-scale attack on Shimen Village. Japanese troops outside Jiukou also opened fire at the same time, with unprecedented intensity. Qinhuangdao heard the sound of artillery fire all night, and residents were extremely panic-stricken, fleeing to the Kailuan mining area. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Suffer Defeat in Fengcheng</h3>
<p>Japanese Commander Commits Suicide</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Fengcheng said that on the 1st of this month, the enemy and rebel troops concentrated in Fengcheng for the second time, attempting to eliminate the righteous army of Deng Tiemei. After being repelled by the righteous army, a Japanese commander simultaneously launched a pincer attack on Deng's troops from the sea. After being severely beaten by Deng's troops, they suffered repeated defeats. They secretly investigated the whereabouts of the righteous army but could not find them. This caused the Japanese commander to become extremely angry and commit suicide at the Fengcheng railway station. Now the enemy is continuing to mobilize a large number of reinforcements, intending to fundamentally eliminate the righteous army to prevent future troubles. Also, because the righteous army appears and disappears in the deep mountains and is repeatedly ambushed, now every time they attack the righteous army, they use more than a hundred civilians, old and young, as the vanguard, with the Japanese army pressing behind them. Our side cannot bear to fight back to avoid mutual slaughter. The righteous army is planning a way to resist. (15th)</p>
<h3>The National Government Remits Funds to Assist the Troops Under Su, Ma, Ding, and Li; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cables Karakhan, Requesting Assistance</h3>
<p>Li Du Goes to Moscow to Meet with Su Ma</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The troops of Ding Chao and Li Du of the Northeast Army fought for years in Jihei against the Japanese invaders. Recently, due to exhaustion of ammunition and food and lack of reinforcements, they had no choice but to retreat into the Primorsky Krai region of Russia. The government, considering that the isolated army was drifting abroad and suffering, and that the Soviet authorities hoped that our government would send funds to help them with food, ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to cable Karakhan, Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union in Moscow, requesting assistance, and telegraphed a large sum of money to provide assistance. It is heard that after the troops of Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen retreated into Russian territory, the central government remitted 300,000 yuan, which was telegraphed to Karakhan for transfer. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Representatives of Ding and Li said that Li Du had engaged in battle with the Japanese army in Mishan this time. Although the Japanese army launched a full-scale general attack, Li's troops suffered very few losses. Li's purpose in entering Russia was to meet with Su Ma. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Du sent a telegram to the representative stationed in Beiping last night, stating that he had already set off for Moscow and would meet with Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan in Moscow to discuss ways to resist Japan. His troops are concentrated in the Jilin and Raohe areas and are being reorganized under the responsibility of Ding Chao. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Britain and Japan Reach a Compromise; The League of Nations Unreservedly Accommodates Japan</p>
<p>The Drummond Plan Completely Disregards Our National Position</p>
<p>The Wording Is Weak and Indecisive; Our Country Can Never Accept It</p>
<h3>The Special Committee of Nineteen Will Convene Again Today</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee of Nineteen will resume its work tomorrow. Major powers, especially Britain, are clearly trying to revise the original draft resolution, explicitly making concessions to make Japan happy to accept it. A telegram has been sent to Tokyo seeking agreement, and a reply is expected by Wednesday. The Special Committee of Nineteen will submit it for discussion on Thursday. According to general observations here, the League of Nations still needs the cooperation of the United States; otherwise, all resolutions will become empty talk. Even if China accepts mediation, it will be no different from surrendering. But the only hope for the future lies in whether it can firmly resist. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the Special Committee of Nineteen meets tomorrow afternoon, Chairman Hymans and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond will present a report on the progress of negotiations with China and Japan during the recess. When Hymans returned home to deal with the cabinet crisis, the issue was almost entirely handled by Drummond. After Hymans returned to Geneva on Friday night, he met with Drummond and the Chinese representative Yan Huijing and the Japanese representative Matsuoka. Therefore, all the facts are now clear. The League of Nations has a more optimistic atmosphere due to the Drummond compromise plan. Although the Japanese government's reply will not be transmitted to Geneva before Tuesday or Wednesday, it is generally believed that Japan will approve of it, or at least open the door to an agreement. Therefore, it is expected that the Special Committee of Nineteen will postpone the meeting for two or three days so that the replies from China and Japan can arrive within these two or three days. It is heard that the Japanese cabinet will meet next Tuesday to consider the issue. As for China's position, it is rather unclear. It is very doubtful whether the Chinese government will accept the negotiated amendments without a struggle. Even the draft resolution in its original form is felt to be too weak by China. Therefore, a revised text has been put forward, clearly stating that it does not recognize "Manchukuo" and that Japan has violated treaties. From China's point of view, Drummond's compromise plan clearly does not take into account China's revised text, but instead asks China to accept a resolution with weak wording. China has already opposed this because of its indecisiveness. In this situation, it is not surprising that China has raised objections. What is difficult to know is whether China will completely reject the recommendations that the Special Committee of Nineteen has already agreed to. Although China approved a resolution in Paris on December 10, 1931, that was similar to the current amendment, China did so because the case stipulated the organization of the Lytton Commission. The current proposal, apart from negotiations with Japan through the mediation of a small committee, clearly does not give China any benefit. However, once it is rejected, the responsibility will be huge, and China will probably think thrice before doing so. One point that is noteworthy at tomorrow's meeting is that the representatives of the small countries who initiated and supported the original resolution last December are not present. The Spanish representative Madariaga, the Irish Free State representative Connolly, the Czechoslovak representative Piñes, and the Swiss representative Motta will not attend and will be replaced by others.

<p>(Geneva) It is now reported that League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond has sent a draft of the new resolution to the Chinese and Japanese representatives to seek the agreement of the two governments. Its content is very different from the old draft proposed by the Committee of Nineteen, with not a single word mentioning the puppet organization of Manchuria, nor mentioning the United States and Soviet Russia, only implying the possibility of inviting some non-member states to join the mediation. According to news from Tokyo, it seems to indicate that the new resolution can be accepted by Japan, but the general public here are suspicious of whether it can be satisfied by China and the League of Nations General Assembly. The Chinese government's note to the countries of the Boxer Protocol concerning the Yuguan Incident has been released here today by Representative Yan Huijing. People in the League of Nations interpret this note as showing China's determination to do its best to resist Japan's invasion of Rehe. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Matsuoka met with Hymans at 4:30 yesterday afternoon. Hymans demanded that Japan must recognize Drummond's compromise plan, otherwise it would plunge the League of Nations into an irrecoverable state of chaos. Matsuoka explained the reasons for Japan's rejection of the participation of the United States and Russia, saying that since the Russo-Japanese War, the United States has been actively trying to buy the South Manchurian Railway. Recently, the competition between the United States and Japan in the three eastern provinces has become increasingly fierce. If the United States is invited to participate in the Sino-Japanese dispute, the feelings between the United States and Japan will inevitably become more uncontrollable. This time, he asked Hymans for understanding and only left at 5:50 PM. (Hualian Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the Chairman's Declaration of the Drummond Plan this afternoon and immediately convened a department meeting. It is heard that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs found the plan unsatisfactory and decided to request the League of Nations to revise it again. It is scheduled to send an instruction telegram to Matsuoka between the 16th and 17th to answer Drummond. The main points of the revision are as follows: (1) The section in the declaration on respecting the Lytton Report is tantamount to acknowledging that the organization of "Manchukuo" was created by Japan. This point should be deleted. (2) The authority of the Five-Nation Committee should be limited to promoting direct Sino-Japanese negotiations and cannot be regarded as a mechanism for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. (3) The League of Nations has not clearly abandoned the invitation of the United States and Russia to participate and hopes to firmly express its rejection of the participation of non-League countries in the mediation of the Sino-Japanese dispute.

<h3>Japanese Military Authorities Openly Express Plans to Invade Rehe; The Situation Is About to Expand to Beiping and Tianjin; The Great War Will Begin with a Single Shot in the Dark; Because of International Interference, They First Make Treacherous Propaganda to the Outside World</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese military authorities now openly admit that if the Rehe issue cannot be resolved peacefully, then sooner or later active military action will be used to bring Rehe under the complete jurisdiction of the "Manchukuo" government. While admitting the possibility of using force, the Japanese army spokesman also claimed to hope for a solution by peaceful means. This is because not only is manual labor now scarce, but if troops are used to take Rehe, the costs will increase and lives will be lost, and it will be easy to cause misunderstandings overseas and give outsiders an excuse to oppose it. Moreover, once the Rehe war begins, it may be necessary to expand the war in North China due to strategic relations. Chinese and many foreigners believe that the Japanese are now seeking an opportunity to invade North China and seize Beiping and Tianjin, but Tokyo does not admit this. The Japanese side says that irresponsible radicals welcome this kind of development, but responsible leaders know that extending the war to mainland China will cause dangerous international disputes. Therefore, if the war zone should extend to mainland China in the future, it will be due to military necessity related to the plan to seize Rehe, not intentional. However, although the Japanese claim to want to obtain Rehe by peaceful means and avoid war in mainland China, the Army Ministry spokesman recently told a Reuters reporter that the great crisis lies in the accidental dropping of bullets. Japan does not want to have a major move in Rehe in the near future, but an accidental shot in the dark can be a warning sign that will cause extremely serious consequences for a large-scale war to break out. The Army Ministry spokesman made this statement on the day Christmas was approaching. Just a few days later, the Yuguan War broke out, and the Japanese had probably expected it long ago. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Hayama: Prime Minister Saito went to Hayama Villa yesterday afternoon to rest. Regarding the Rehe issue and the League of Nations situation, he said, "Zhang Xueliang is doing his best to increase troops in Rehe, and the Japanese army should be prepared to deal with his active actions. However, the Japanese army in "Manchukuo" is sufficient to suppress the active actions of the Chinese army, so there is no need to调兵 from the mainland. Japan should strive to resolve the Rehe issue and not allow the situation to expand beyond the territory of "Manchukuo". This is Japan's fundamental policy for resolving the Rehe issue. As for the League of Nations situation, I have not received a complete report, but it seems that there is no appropriate solution to the Sino-Japanese issue. It is expected that the League of Nations will definitely consider ways to break the situation and accommodate Japan's claims." (United Press Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Speech by Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhaoji</h3>
<p>Japanese Actions Undermine World Peace</p>
<p>Hope Major Powers Do Not Adopt a Policy of Tolerance</p>
<p>Hampden: Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji gave a speech here, expressing doubts about whether the League of Nations will take resolute action to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute, believing that the actions of the League of Nations may depend on the decisions of the major powers in the future. In the final conclusion, he claimed, "Major powers should decide which is more important, maintaining the sanctity of the League of Nations and various peace treaties, or suffering the consequences of adopting a policy of tolerance towards Japan. However, he still feels difficult to be optimistic about this kind of decision by the major powers." He also said, "Japan's aggression is an attack on the world order. If all countries do not have the determination to deal with it, it will endanger civilization. Japan has brazenly threatened to destroy the League of Nations, abandon peace treaties, and violate Eastern morality and Western legal concepts, but the League of Nations will not be able to take effective action until the major powers have made the necessary decisions."

<h3>Britain and Japan Are in Cahoots; Is the Visit of the British Ambassador to Japan to Uchida Really Without Political Significance?</h3>
<p>(London) The British Ambassador to Japan recently visited the Japanese authorities. It has just been explained here that the purpose of his visit was only to ask the Japanese government to maintain the safety of British expatriates in the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and not to inform Japan of any political action that Britain will take in the Far East.

<h3>The United States Does Not Ask Japan to Protect American Expatriates in North China</h3>
<p>Otherwise, It Would Be Tantamount to Recognizing Japan's Expanded Actions</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. State Department stated today that the United States will not ask Japan to protect American expatriates in North China. It is said that the State Department believes that if it wants to request protection for American expatriates in North China, it should apply to the Chinese government. It is also recognized in official circles that if Japan is asked to protect American expatriates, it would be tantamount to recognizing Japan's expansion of actions in North China. However, it is heard that the State Department has hinted that if conflicts arise again in northern China, the United States will warn both China and Japan to protect the lives and property of American expatriates. Also, diplomatic circles here commented that the tension in Geneva regarding the Yuguan Incident has eased slightly. According to news obtained by diplomatic circles, it seems that conflicts between China and Japan will not arise again. Some diplomats even said that the recent revision of the resolution drafted by the subcommittee of the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations, in order to ease Japan's opposition, is also in line with the views recently expressed by Sir Lytton.

<h3>Japan's Abuse of Military Force Will Ultimately Bring Self-Destruction</h3>
<p>Editorial in the British Observer</p>
<p>(London) An editorial in the British Observer stated that the most terrible and dangerous event in the world today is Japan's concentration of heavy forces to consolidate Japan's authority on the Asian continent from Korea to the Great Wall. Anyone who embraces pragmatism will never believe that Japan's objectives will always be limited by the Great Wall. Japan intends to eliminate Zhang Xueliang's power in North China. If Zhang uses Beiping as his base, the Japanese army will inevitably advance on China's old capital. There is no doubt that Japan intends to choose this opportunity. Tokyo knows that Britain, Russia, America, and Germany will not poison it. In terms of Manchuria itself, Japan does have important interests, which the Chinese government failed to protect, causing Japan to handle it itself. However, what Japan has done has exceeded its original purpose, and made its reasons for being excused turn into actions that, if continued, will be unanimously condemned by the world. We can do nothing now except admit that Japan can do what it wants to do, and strongly advise Japan not to destroy the Great Wall. We must refuse to recognize "Manchukuo". I think the Japanese people can ultimately act within the scope of reason and not blindly follow the abuse of military force. But if Japan makes a big mistake now, the inevitable result will be Japan's own destruction. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Active Military Deployment in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Violates the League of Nations Mandate Principles</p>
<p>| Poses a Major Threat to the United States |</p>
<p>(Washington) Iraq was originally a territory mandated by the League of Nations to be ruled by Britain. Recently, it was liberated by Britain and recognized as a member of the League of Nations. A certain important person in American political circles expressed his opinion on this matter, saying that any method regarding mandated territories cannot take effect without the consent of the United States, because the mandate system was established after the victory over Germany, and the United States contributed to the victory over Germany. When the Paris Peace Conference concluded the European War, various principles were announced, one of which was that all countries should give equal treatment to their own people and the people of other countries within the mandated territory, and should not monopolize any interests or engage in any secret activities. This declaration by a certain important person in the United States seems to be specifically aimed at Japan's right to rule over the Caroline Islands in the Pacific. In addition, when the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations discussed the issue of Japanese-ruled territories on November 11 last year, someone also protested against Japan's unreasonable expenditures. The two incidents before and after can be compared with each other. The islands ruled by Japan are located between the Philippine Islands and the Hawaiian Islands. Judging from Japan's actions in that area, it can be believed that it has not complied with the aforementioned principles. Although the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, it can still demand the revocation of Japan's mandate. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Current Problem of Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>If the people of our nation are not forgetful, they should still be able to recall the time when the September 18th Incident suddenly erupted. The strategists of the nation and the generals in command of troops, in brilliant written messages, declared to us: firstly, that "there is ultimately justice in the world"; and secondly, that "accept adversity passively and offer no resistance." When the enemy invaders penetrated deep and approached Jinzhou, the last line of defense outside the customs, they realized that non-resistance was not a viable plan. Thus, there was a declaration of "long-term resistance," and the local officials also sent out telegrams "vowing to defend the territory to the death." However, before long, Jinzhou was abandoned without a fight. After the fall of Jinzhou, the authorities, while expressing "a determination never to lose another inch of land," were not heard to have made any military preparations. As a result, Shanhaiguan fell, and then Jiumentou was occupied. The reason for this was that they had not yet abandoned their reliance on the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The enemy knew our situation very well. Therefore, in military affairs, they adopted a method of gradual conquest strategically, and in dealing with people, they adopted a method of defeating them one by one. When the Japanese occupied the three northeastern provinces, world opinion was in an uproar for a time. The general defending Jinzhou also expressed his determination to die. If the Japanese had attacked Jinzhou at that time, the international situation would inevitably have become tense, and our resistance would have been very strong, which would have been unfavorable to them. Therefore, they delayed it for a long time, waiting for the outcry of public opinion to gradually subside and the anger of our soldiers and officers to diminish. Then, with a slight pretext, they launched a sudden attack, and were able to take Jinzhou without bloodshed. From the fall of Jinzhou to the capture of Shanhaiguan, the Japanese had consistently used their unchanging strategy to carve up our land. After each cut, they would temporarily leave it alone, so that they could chip away at it day by day without encountering resistance until death. If they made cut after cut in a single day, even the most cowardly would be aroused due to unbearable pain. The Japanese adopted the method of gradual conquest with this intention. Furthermore, during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the Japanese declared that their target was solely the 19th Route Army and that they would not start conflicts with other troops. Later, in their attacks on the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, they used both coercion and enticement to prevent the national army from openly assisting. As for today, the battle of Shanhaiguan is said to be directed solely at Zhang Xueliang. Since the Japanese are well aware of the Chinese people's mentality of seeking temporary peace, this method of gradual conquest and defeating them one by one is the most poisonous and effective.</p>
<p>What goes hand in hand with military affairs is that, on the diplomatic front, they also use this idea of gradual conquest and defeating them one by one to apply to the powerful nations of the League of Nations. First, they use various delaying tactics and intimidation to prevent the powerful nations from making a decision on their stance, waiting for a change in the situation. Then, they leisurely dispatch eloquent diplomatic representatives to lobby various countries with sweet words, causing each powerful nation to change its mind. Representatives such as Matsuoka Yosuke and others run around making contacts and engaging in secret activities. At each meeting, they employ their skills of seduction, coercion, and provocation among the representatives of each country. It can now be proven that they have achieved satisfactory results. Looking at yesterday's newspaper, which carried the Japanese side's transmission of the newly agreed-upon plan, it said that Sugimura had already reached an understanding with Drummond. "The points of understanding are purely in accordance with the Japanese wishes." We still suspected the Japanese of overzealous propaganda. Now, looking at the Guomin News Agency's Geneva dispatch, it actually said that "Drummond has sent the draft of the new resolution to the Chinese and Japanese representatives to solicit their agreement. Its content is vastly different from the old draft proposed by the Committee of Nineteen. It does not contain a single word mentioning the Manchurian puppet organization, nor does it mention the United States and the Soviet Union. It only vaguely suggests the possibility of inviting some non-member states to join the mediation." This kind of new draft is a proposal specifically to help the Japanese. Thus, the situation of the General Assembly in the future can be imagined. The League of Nations has already been gradually conquered by Japan. The powers have already been defeated one by one by Japan. No wonder the Japanese express joy and celebrate their diplomatic success.</p>
<p>Under the policy of non-resistance, the Japanese have applied this method of gradual conquest and defeating them one by one in both military and diplomatic arenas, and have achieved remarkable results. They have forced us into a desperate situation. The mistake of non-resistance has reached such a point. The miscalculation of following the old ways and seeking temporary peace has reached such a point. Have our people finally become aware of this?</p>

<h3>He Chengjun Telegrams to Request Transfer of Bandit Suppression Troops to Resist Japan, Stating That It Will Have No Impact on the Future of Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun telegraphed Chiang [Kai-shek], stating that Rehe is under alarm and the situation is expanding, requesting the transfer of two divisions of bandit suppression troops to the north to resist Japan. The telegram stated: Since Xu's bandits have fled towards Sichuan, I have repeatedly telegraphed and consulted with the generals of Sichuan and Shaanxi, urging them to transfer elite troops to assist the central army in surrounding and suppressing them on all sides. After the Yuguan Incident occurred, I urged them even more urgently. Fortunately, the Sichuan affair has come to an end, and there is still peace and quiet in Shaanxi Province. The Sichuan and Shaanxi armies are both free to transfer troops. Song Yao is working very hard to suppress bandits, so the forces assembled for bandit suppression are more than the quota. In addition, Zhang Hongyuan's troops are in the Ankang area, and Feng Qinzai's entire force is near Xi'an, as well as troops directly under the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, all of which can be deployed at any time. Furthermore, after investigation, Xu's bandits have suffered heavy losses from repeated suppressions, with only about seven or eight thousand remnants and five or six thousand guns. Even if they are fearless of death, brave, and good at fighting, the troops already dispatched by Sichuan and Shaanxi are more than enough to eliminate the bandits. The Hu and Liu divisions are only sharing a portion of the task here. At present, Yuguan has fallen, Rehe is under alarm, and the Japanese invaders are imposing unreasonable oppression. The situation is gradually expanding. The two division commanders of Hu and Liu, as well as the generals and soldiers at the front, have repeatedly requested to be allowed to fight against the enemy. If necessary, transferring the two divisions to the north to resist the enemy will not have any impact on the future of bandit suppression. I am submitting this telegraph for your consideration. Whether it is appropriate or not is up to your decision. (11th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Volunteer Army in Plainclothes Blows Up South Manchurian Railway Track</h3>
<p>Train Derails and Overturns</p>
<p>(Panyang) At 0:59 this morning, about 100 volunteer soldiers in plainclothes ambushed 21 meters of the South Manchurian Railway at a location 329 kilometers from Dalian, near Liaoyang Station. Train No. 255, which was traveling from Dalian to Shenyang, did not know that the road had been destroyed and continued to run at full speed, causing the entire train to derail and overturn. The ambushers then launched a fierce attack, killing two engineers on the spot. Twelve train cars were burned and suffered severe damage. Train No. 288, which was following behind, derailed. When the Japanese military police heard about the incident, they dispatched a rescue train from Shenyang at 5:25 this morning. By the time the train arrived, the volunteer soldiers had disappeared without a trace. The scene was too gruesome to look at. It is said that the Volunteer Army had previously attempted to blow up the South Manchurian Railway between Tasan and Fenshuiling last night, but were arrested. Despite the fact that the Japanese railway guards were on high alert, this incident still occurred. Japanese residents are very dissatisfied with the Japanese military and are criticizing their incompetence. (15th Hualian News Agency)</p>
<h3>Atrocities of the Japanese Army in Yuguan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Chinese person who is a trusted confidant of a certain Japanese army official, he personally witnessed countless Japanese soldiers firing two volleys and then falsely accusing our side of provoking the incident.

On the same day, more than 20 local gentry from Yuguan raised the flag of welcome to the Japanese Empire in order to welcome the Japanese army into the city. However, after entering the city, the Japanese army suddenly drove these people together and shot them all with machine guns. This serves as a warning to those who recognize a thief as their father. Chinese soldiers who were captured, Chinese people working for the Japanese army, and those carrying water for the Japanese army were forced to drink a cup first, fearing that the water had been poisoned.

<h3>Local Organizations May Not Occupy Temples</h3>
<p>Judicial Yuan Responds to Inquiry from Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior stated that recently, local organizations have been using temples as assembly places or establishing organizations in the name of temporary offices, leading to disputes with the temples. The Ministry requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan. The Judicial Yuan's interpretation is that if a temple has a resident abbot, and the temple was built by the abbot through fundraising, the temple property is public property, not official property, and may not be allocated to any organization by local government offices. Also, no local organization may arbitrarily estimate, use, or demolish it. If there is no resident monk or Taoist priest, the competent government office must solicit the opinions of local monks and Taoist priests of the same religion and select an abbot to manage it. Local organizations may not occupy or demolish it, and all provincial and county local government offices are ordered to comply. (15th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anhui Taihe County Magistrate Zhang Zemin's Excellent Governance</h3>
<p>Taihe is located on the edge of Anhui Province and has always been plagued by bandits. In addition, years of drought and flood have left the people destitute. After the chaos, governance is even more difficult. Fortunately, this autumn, our county magistrate, Zhang Gong Zemin, was appointed to lead Taihe. Since taking office, he has devoted himself to governing with great care, such as suppressing bandits and communists, punishing the inferior, eliminating the malpractices of tax collection, arresting those who falsely recruit [soldiers], organizing Baojia [local self-defense units] to facilitate self-defense, operating granaries to prepare for food shortages, and supporting education and promoting construction. He reported disasters, begged for relief, and requested tax reductions. He worked day and night, not daring to rest. All matters related to relieving the people's suffering, providing peace of mind, and benefiting the people were sought and implemented. Therefore, although the people of this county are still in a state of unrepaired wounds, they are still happily singing praises of his virtuous governance and admire his transformation, showing their devotion. Such a clean, diligent, benevolent, and wise official deserves the title of "benevolent magistrate" and the praise of "compassionate ruler." The citizens and others, feeling grateful, have nothing to repay. In addition to submitting a public petition to the Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs to request an award, we are jointly publishing this in the newspapers to promote his political achievements. Representatives of the people of the Fifth District of Taihe County, Li Luqing, Fan Linqing, Zheng Xiangdong, Cao Langzhai, Xie Yanxiang, Shan Pinzhi, Xu Xianting, Wang Zhenwu, Wu Lang, Guo Mingqi, Wang Zhuoran, Wang Dianyu, Huaiqing, etc., respectfully salute.</p>

<h3>French Parliamentarian Proposes Lottery to Ease Financial Difficulties</h3>

<h3>The Northeast Question and the League of Nations (13)</h3>
<p>Facts First, Then Legal Principles</p>
<p>Regarding the question of facts, it has been discussed above. Now, let's briefly elaborate on the question of legal principles. In this regard, the Japanese representative once said, "Then why don't we submit this matter to the League of Nations? This question is often raised. The answer to this is, in short, (1) On the emotional level of the Japanese people, interference with the Manchurian issue is not allowed; (2) The League of Nations' handling of cases is extremely slow. If we submit this case to the League of Nations, the position of Japanese residents including Koreans in Manchuria will be severely oppressed; (3) The psychology of the Japanese people is quite different from that of Westerners. Westerners begin to argue before the problem becomes serious, while the Japanese believe that there must be a solution, so the waste of time is relatively long; (4) Once an incident breaks out, it will proceed naturally and cannot be contained." The above four points are the reasons clearly stated by the Japanese representative to the Executive Yuan. The meaning of these reasons is that "the rights and wrongs of international relations should all be judged solely by the emotions of a country. Japan cannot adopt the Western method of arguing before the incident becomes serious, because Japan firmly holds the hope of a solution." But what is this hope? In our view, it is when China is in a state of extreme difficulty, when China is suffering the most serious historical disaster (the floods in the Yangtze River basin), and when it is making every effort to quell the red bandit disturbances in various provinces. This is the time that Japan is waiting for. This is not only the time when China suffers the most, but also the time when all countries in the world are affected by economic depression and fall into extreme difficulty, such as the national debt problem, the compensation problem, the military preparations problem, the unemployment problem, the budget balance problem, and the social unrest problem, all of which are major. This is the period that Japan hopes for, and this period came in September 1931. What is the solution that Japan hopes for? It can only be said that "Japan can completely control this matter without worrying about the interference of other countries in the world." The Japanese military actions began in Shenyang and continued in Jilin, Changchun, Andong, and Yingkou. The solution is based on its plan to precisely implement the occupation of the entire three northeastern provinces and separate them from other parts of China. The so-called "once an incident breaks out, it will proceed naturally" by the Japanese representative refers to this. Moreover, the Japanese representative commented on the report of the investigation team that maintaining the status of "Manchukuo" was not a satisfactory solution, saying, "We cannot make this kind of consideration." This is what the Japanese representative said. The tone of its decision cannot be changed, in addition to being a challenge to the League of Nations and the world, there is probably no other way to explain it. The Japanese representative's words are tantamount to saying that whether it is legal or illegal, just or unjust, the League of Nations or no League of Nations, peace or non-peace, what Japan can consider is only Japan's interests. The rights, interests, happiness, and order of China and other countries in the world have nothing to do with Japan, or at least should be regarded as secondary to Japan's interests. Here, I dare to ask, does this kind of attitude really conform to the feelings and hopes of the world? As a result of the World War, have we still not learned a lesson? Should the Covenant of the League of Nations be regarded as waste paper? Can the signature of the Japanese plenipotentiary on the Kellogg-Briand Pact be regarded merely as a pretense? Does the Nine-Power Treaty, which stipulates respect for China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, merely serve as a signature-style display for the representatives of the signatory countries? Are the resolutions passed by the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations and accepted by Japan of no more importance than the records of any ordinary debate? If the answers to all these questions should be negative, if we must maintain the dignity of the League of Nations to prevent serious external attacks, if we must maintain the new dawn of international peace based on international cooperation, if we sincerely wish to reduce armaments without endangering our security, if we wish to avoid the recurrence of the bloodshed of past history and resolve all international disputes by peaceful means, if we must gradually recognize that the permanent peace of mankind should be based on justice and legal principles, then we should rise up to meet the challenge of Japan.

<h3>Liang Han Cao Discusses Three Major Tasks of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Drafting the Constitution</p>
<p>Creating Regulations for the Political Council</p>
<p>Completing Revisions to the Criminal Law</p>
<p>Liang Han Cao, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, gave a talk yesterday about the Yuan's important work, which is outlined below. Liang said, "The Legislative Yuan's achievements last year were generally well received. The main reason for this is that those in charge understood the importance of their position and were unwilling to relax in the face of difficulties. When Mr. Sun took over as the head of this Yuan, he continued to recruit the former members, except for those who had other tasks or special circumstances. This was done to ensure the protection of public servants and to facilitate the continuity of the Yuan's work. In our opinion, the most important of the Yuan's tasks are the following three: (1) Drafting the Constitution; (2) Drafting the Organic Law of the National Political Council; (3) Completing the revision of the Criminal Law. Regarding the drafting of the Constitution, since the establishment of the Republic of China, wars have been unsettled. Those who discuss politics generally attribute this to the government's failure to promulgate a complete constitution. In order to respect civil rights, concentrate national strength, and save the country from danger, the Central Government specifically decided at the Third Plenary Session to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. The Legislative Yuan has the responsibility of drafting the constitution. Beforehand, it is necessary to conduct serious and thorough preparations, such as adopting the will of the people, investigating local customs, education, and economy, and collecting reference materials, in order to achieve excellent results. Otherwise, previous constitutions will be regarded as discarded items. These violate the above-mentioned principles. We should be vigilant against the mistakes of the past and value our mission, lest we repeat the mistakes of our predecessors and leave behind future sins. Regarding the drafting of the Organic Law of the Political Council, the Central Government has also set a deadline for the convening of the National Political Council, which must be convened within this year. The drafting of all regulations must be completed and promulgated in advance by the end of May. At this time of transition from martial law to constitutional government, the spirit of legislation should be based on the provisional constitution during the period of martial law, and at the same time, it should refer to the various points raised at the National Crisis Conference. Once the Central Political Council decides on all the principles, it must be started immediately. The determination of the number of people, the ratio of categories and regions, and the number of elections and appointments must all be decided as soon as possible. Regarding the completion of the revision of the Criminal Law, the previous committee had already completed part of the work. Whether the organization of the drafting committee for the revision of the Criminal Law will be changed has not yet been decided. Some people advocate that in addition to the members of the previous committee, in order to increase efficiency, it may be possible to add more people. This view is more similar, because the defects of the currently implemented Criminal Law can be pointed out by all legal scholars. Everyone hopes that the new law will be completed as soon as possible, because it is related to human rights and civil rights, and its significance is very important. If we look at the research on criminal law by legal experts in modern European and American countries, it progresses with the times. Our country, which claims to be the most ancient country in culture, should not fall behind others. Only then can we be worthy of the people and the international community. In short, the Yuan is responsible for legislation, and its task is not only to draft the articles, but also to pay attention to the progress of modern legal systems in various countries of the East and West, and to the changes in the social conditions in the country, so that the regulations can be formulated and implemented without drawbacks." Liang said that Mr. Sun came to Beijing this time, first busy with discussing the great plan to resist foreign aggression with the central authorities. After arriving at the Yuan and taking office the other day, he only met with the members in Beijing one after another to exchange opinions, in order to provide a guideline for the improvement of the Yuan's work in the future. As for all planning, it will only be possible to start after the symposium held next Tuesday. (Everyday News)</p>
<h3>The Suppression of Banditry in Jiangxi; Defeating Bandits Raiding Fuzhou</h3>
<p>A Band of Bandits Emerges from Zixi to Invade</p>
<p>A Bloody Battle Outside the City Results in Heavy Losses for the Bandits</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang reports that after the collapse of Zhu Mao Peng Lin's various bandit factions, which invaded Fuzhou via Jinxi last year, they concentrated their main forces between Lichuan and Zixi. The fake 22nd Independent Division in northern Fujian then concentrated between Zixi and Guixi to avoid direct confrontation. Instead, they bypassed southern Jiangxi and southern Hunan, emerging from Zixi and attacking the northeastern flank of the Nationalist army. They quickly captured Zixi on New Year's Day. The fake 1st Army led by Lin Biao and the fake 3rd Army led by Peng Dehuai captured Jinxi on the 4th, continuing their advance on Fuzhou along the original route. The fake northern Fujian army captured Lixiang on the 6th. However, the bandits' main target remained Fuzhou, while the attack on Nanchang was a feint to distract the Nationalist army. Therefore, the situation in Fuzhou was quite tense. The first to reinforce Jinxi was the regiment led by Hun Yuan of the 5th Division. Yesterday morning, the brigade of the 5th Division set out from Huangdu to assist. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the brigade fought bravely. From dawn until dusk, their machine guns and artillery fired incessantly, preventing the bandits from succeeding. The forward command post on the He River was prepared for Zhu Mao's northern advance. They had already concentrated the Zhi Rou Division and Wu Qi's division in Longgudu and combined them with Sun Lianzhong's troops in Yichuan. On the 5th, they advanced towards Bingfang. At noon on the 7th, various units launched a flanking attack to encircle the right flank of Bingfang. The fake 3rd Army, led by the bandit Peng, retreated southeast after a brief resistance. However, the fake 1st Army led by Lin Biao suddenly arrived at Xushi, reaching the border of Linchuan. On the 8th, they entered the vicinity of Fuzhou. The Nationalist army lured the bandits deeper into the area, lying in ambush near Fuzhou. Bai Tianmin's troops, arriving in Fuzhou from the provincial capital, also joined the front line, waiting for the enemy. On the 10th, the bandits advanced to the Liufang area, launching a fierce attack on Fuzhou. Chen Cheng's various departments waited until the bandits were close before launching a counterattack with machine guns and artillery. Planes dispatched from the provincial capital flew over Fuzhou, dropping bombs. The bandits suffered countless casualties and began to retreat in the afternoon. Fuzhou remained peaceful as usual, and the defenses around the city were extremely secure. Near the provincial capital, the 10th Army led by Li Mo'an guarded the area, and the market was very stable, unaffected by the disturbance of the Red bandits in Fuzhou. (January 11)</p>
<h3>Fujian Armies Combating Local Bandits in the North and South</h3>
<p>The Remnants of Chen Guohui's Band Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>Red Bandits Disturbing Northern Fujian Scattered and Defeated</p>
<p>A Portion of the Marine Corps Transferred to the Capital for Training</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou reports that after the former commander of the First Brigade of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army, Chen Guohui, was executed by firing squad last month, the regiment commanders under him, Chen Peiyu, Chen Yucai, and Peng Tongsan, gathered over two thousand men and wreaked havoc in the border area between Jinjiang, Nan'an, Anxi, and Yongchun counties in southern Fujian. They formed groups of dozens to over a hundred, looting and kidnapping. They based themselves in Chen Guohui's hometown, Badu in Nan'an, with extremely tight defenses. People leaving the area were required to obtain a passport to pass through. Rice could only be transported in, not out. All kidnapped people were transported to Badu and held in the Pengshan hills. The Pacification Commissioner repeatedly received petitions from the people of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Yongchun, and Anxi counties requesting suppression of the bandits. He ordered the 19th Route Army's Zhang Li brigade, stationed in Quanzhou, and the Provincial Defense Army's Xiao Shuxuan brigade, stationed in Dehua, to jointly suppress the bandits. After receiving the order, the two brigade commanders mobilized on January 5th and 6th. Xiao's brigade moved from Xianyou to block the border between Yongchun and Nan'an counties. Zhang's brigade used the Third Regiment to attack from Fenghu in Jinjiang and the First Regiment to attack from Xiwei in Anxi, encircling Badu. In two battles, the bandits were defeated and abandoned Pengshan, fleeing in different directions. Chen Peiyu fled into the mountains, Chen Yucai fled to Daqian, and Peng Tong disappeared. The troops are currently searching for the bandits in Pengshan, Daluoxi, Yingdu, Pengdao, and other places in order to eliminate them completely.</p>
<p>The fake 12th Army's 34th and 36th Divisions recently fled from western Fujian to the area between Yong'an and Shaxian in northern Fujian. The Red bandits gathered in Zechuan were attacked on three sides by Lu Xingbang's 5th Brigade led by Ye Xingjin in the Caoyuan area, the 6th Brigade led by Zhang Xinglong in the Ansah area, and the 4th Brigade led by Lu Xingrong in the Shankou area. The bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and withdrew from Zechuan, fleeing to Xikou and retreating towards Qingliu. Lu Xingbang has already telegraphed the provincial government to report that Shaxian and Yong'an counties have been completely recovered. Currently, Zhang Xingrong's brigade is guarding Shaxian, Zhang Xinglong's brigade is guarding Yong'an, and Ye Xingjin is leading the entire 6th Brigade and the training regiment to Qingliu to pursue the bandits. The defense of northern Fujian has now been redistributed by the Pacification Director Cai Yanbai: Zhang Yan's brigade of the 9th Route Army is stationed in Shaowu, Yun Yinglin's brigade is stationed in Yanping, Zhou Zhiqun's brigade is stationed in Guangze, Liu Heding's division is stationed in Jian'ou, Jianyang, Shunchang, and Jiangle, Lu Xingbang's division is stationed in Shaxian, Yong'an, Guihua, and Qingliu, Liu Zhennian's division is stationed in Pucheng, Zhenghe, and Songxi, and Chen Wei'yuan's brigade is stationed along both banks of the Min River from Fuzhou to Yanping. Zou Minfu's training regiment of the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army, originally stationed in Yanping, has been transferred back to Fuzhou to defend the northwestern villages.</p>
<p>The First Marine Brigade led by Yang Yanying, stationed in the coastal counties under the jurisdiction of Fuzhou, and the Second Marine Brigade led by Lin Bingzhou, stationed in the coastal counties under the jurisdiction of Funing, have both received orders from the Naval Headquarters to go to Nanjing for training. Yesterday, the Jing'an and Zhen'an warships were dispatched to Fujian to transport them. The first batch was Huang Maohe's regiment of the Yang Yanying brigade, which will travel by ship from Mawei to Zhenjiang to disembark. The remaining troops will be transported within one month. Which unit will take over the defense of their original territory is still to be decided by the Pacification Commissioner. (January 11)</p>
<h3>Record of the Songjiang Bank Creditors' Meeting</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Songjiang reports that the Songjiang Bank Creditors' Group held its fifth creditors' meeting at the law offices of Liu Zhimou at 1:00 PM yesterday. Over fifty people attended, including Bai Guanlan, Li Yaxin, and Lian Laotai. Bai Guanlan was elected chairman, and Zhang Zuoliu was elected secretary. The resolutions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The court has scheduled a retrial in this case for the 18th. How should the agent request a judgment in court?</p>
<p>Resolution: The agent should request the court to order the defendants to jointly and severally repay the debt and to implement the seizure of the defendants' assets.</p>
<p>(2) At the hearing on November 6th of last year, the defendant's lawyer, Sha Mouyi, argued that the judgment should order Songjiang Bank to bear the responsibility for repayment or to repay with the assets of Songjiang Bank. Is this reasonable?</p>
<p>Resolution: Since Songjiang Bank has not been registered in accordance with the Company Law, it is naturally unable to enjoy the rights of a legal person. It would be unreasonable to order an empty bank to bear the responsibility. Furthermore, the plaintiff's claim is against the responsible persons of the bank, Xie Liangda, Zhang Xiaomei, and others, in their individual capacities. In substance, the judgment should be made against them in their individual capacities. Moreover, since the bank is not a limited liability company, the subject of the judgment should be the defendants, and the judgment cannot be limited to repayment with the bank's assets. The principle is very clear. Some have said that only Xie Liangda should be held personally responsible, but this is unreasonable. The defendants are all shareholders responsible for the bank's operations and should be jointly and severally liable according to law. This argument is too careless. This type of debt lawsuit is a common case in the court, and there should be no unusual judgment. Therefore, this case is not a problem.</p>
<p>Jin Yuyan moved an impromptu motion: If a legal judgment cannot be obtained after the retrial on the 18th, should other methods be used to proceed with the case?</p>
<p>Resolution: (1) Proceed item by item according to the previous meeting. (2) The creditors should automatically convene an organization to request the courts and the responsible persons of the bank to eliminate the debt.</p>
<p>The chairman submitted a proposal: A letter from a named creditor stated that Zhang Qiliu, a debtor of Songjiang Bank, had been ordered by the court to deposit the money. It was heard that Zhang Qiliu's money had been used to offset 500 yuan from Fu Ruishu's passbook and 2,000 yuan from Fu Liji's passbook. If this is true, the liquidation office's handling is unfair. How should this be handled?</p>
<p>Resolution: 1. Bai Guanlan and Zhang Zuoliu are nominated to go to the liquidation office to inquire about the situation before further discussion. 2. Please ask the person who submitted the letter to go to Liu's law office to explain the situation in detail in order to deal with it.</p>
<p>Ye Mouqing said that there is a reason why this case is being handled in this way. According to rumors from teahouses and taverns, a certain great lawyer is manipulating things from behind the scenes, and recently a certain great lawyer has been very close to the court. The truth in this is worth pondering, and we should find a countermeasure.</p>
<p>[P Songjiang County Decrees Reduction of Bran Cake Business Tax]</p>
<p>The county business tax on bran cake was originally collected at a rate of 1/1000. After the revision of the business tax regulations, it was increased to 5/1000. The Songjiang Bran Cake Industry Association and the Hujing Bran Cake Industry merchants jointly strove to present a petition to the Ministry of Finance and the Provincial Department of Finance requesting a reduction. The ministry ordered the provincial department to resolve the issue, but to no avail. The industry association argued that the current rural economy is more difficult than other classes. Chinese farmers account for 85% of the population. Bran cake is a necessary item for farmers, similar in importance to grain. The party's program is to alleviate the rural economy and improve the lives of farmers. Bran cake, which is used by farmers, should be treated with special consideration and the tax burden reduced. Bran is the outer skin of wheat, and cake is the dregs of beans. Wheat and beans have already been subject to business tax. The reason for reducing the bran cake tax is not an excessive demand. After correspondence, the province approved the reduction of the bran cake business tax to 2/1000. This is good news for farmers.</p>
<h3>Taicang Boatmen in Quanhua District Assault Self-Defense Corps Members</h3>
<p>The various districts of the county, aware of the rampant banditry in the countryside, organized self-defense corps during the winter defense period, with able-bodied men from each household taking turns on patrol every night for self-defense. Chen Shouzhi, the chief of the Xu Wanghua Self-Defense Corps in the Eighth District, was on duty on the night of the 13th, leading corps members on patrol along the banks of the Sheng Yao Wan River when they saw four Jiangbei boats with suspicious traces. The corps members ordered the boats to leave the area, but there was no response. Chen Xiaxia went on board to investigate and was suddenly struck on the head by a boatman, immediately bleeding profusely and falling unconscious on the boat. The corps members, realizing the situation was bad, surrounded the boat and sent a message to the Mao City Security Corps for assistance. A squad of corps members was dispatched to capture the four Jiangbei boats and send them to the county government for handling. Meanwhile, the injured chief Chen Shouzhi was taken to Taicang Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are severe and, due to the cold weather, his recovery is uncertain.</p>
<h3>Villager Killed by Bullet While Capturing Thieves</h3>
<p>In the area of Xu Jiaqiao, one mile away from Lu Hezhen, the home of farmer Zhang Fasheng was robbed on the night of the 13th. More than ten thieves broke down the door and stole clothing and other items worth over forty yuan. Hearing the alarm, nearby residents came out to capture the thieves, who opened fire and fled. A villager was shot and killed. The county has been notified and requested to investigate.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Patrolmen Assist in Kidnapping Bride and Robbing Funds</h3>
<p>Shouzhu, the daughter of Xu Pansheng, a villager from Youchetou in Gedaiqiao in the southern suburbs of Wuxi County, was betrothed to Dai Shenglin as his wife, but had not yet married. Unexpectedly, the day before, Dai Shenglin colluded with patrolmen Zhi Deguang and Wu Yongnian from the Ninth Precinct police station to kidnap the bride from Xu's home and rob 50 yuan in hội funds. The villagers, misunderstanding, sounded the gong. Wang Jinbiao, the patrol officer of the county water patrol team stationed in Gedaiqiao, learned of the incident and dispatched patrol officer Wang Yunjiang with a team of sixteen men to arrest Zhi Deguang, Dai Shenglin, and others, and send them to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order Against Anti-Japanese Protests</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government had previously issued an order restricting the anti-Japanese associations in each county from having the right to inspect suspected Japanese goods in people's homes and the public security bureaus in each county from having the responsibility to dispatch police to assist. After receiving the order, the local Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association argued that the loss of the Northeast had already been more than a year, and the country's situation was critical. Apart from the righteous armies drinking ice and bathing in blood, the only way to resist was for the people in the rear to strictly implement a permanent economic boycott of Japan. Recently, reports have stated that imports of Japanese goods have surged and are being sold off as much as possible. The government is intensifying inspections in the Yangtze River basin. How is this current order any different from issuing a talisman for the sale of suspected Japanese goods? Therefore, it telegraphed anti-Japanese associations in various counties to protest together and presented it to the provincial party headquarters to make it clear.</p>
<h3>Special Tax to be Levied on Kerosene Refining</h3>
<p>Since the Zhaofeng Oil Factory outside the west gate of this county first invented the refining of kerosene from shale oil, many oil refineries have sprung up due to the low cost and good profits. There are as many as forty or fifty in the city. As a result, the kerosene of various brands such as Asia, Fudex, and Shigu has been greatly affected, and the coal oil tax collected by the Ministry of Finance has also been greatly reduced. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Finance, considering the oil refining industry as a new enterprise, decided to levy a special business tax and sent the brother of Yang Youguan, Yang Chengxuan, to organize the tax collection agency. The tax rate has also been stipulated by the Department of Finance and will be implemented soon. Furthermore, in order to maintain the sales of their kerosene, companies such as Asia have made a special request to increase the import tax on Russian shale oil to about 25 taels per ton.</p>
<h3>Tax Police in Xiting, Nantong Shoot and Kill Villager</h3>
<p>Police officers Li Guangyu and Xiang Yu, and others of the 31st Detachment of the tax police in the Xiting district of Nantong, took weapons late at night to search the home of villager Li Shou and fired a warning shot. The bullet hit Li Shou's eldest son, killing him immediately. The security corps arrested the police and handed them over to team leader Guo Ping. The case is under review by the court.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Opening the Sanli Han in Haian</h3>
<p>The Sanli Han in Haian, Taixian County, is very important to the water conservancy of the upper and lower reaches. After repeated efforts by the counties of Tongzhou and Rugao to open it, the Department of Construction sent engineers to survey the area. It was decided to restore the Han or rebuild the ship lock. The construction costs will be shared by the counties of Nantong, Rugao, Taixian, and Dongtai. The county magistrates and chairmen of the chambers of commerce are discussing how to proceed.</p>
<h3>Relief for Financial Stagnation in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, aware of the local financial stagnation and commercial paralysis, decided to take action to provide relief to prevent the collapse of the entire port's commerce. The chairman, Lu Xiaobo, convened a meeting of industry leaders at 3:00 PM yesterday. Over thirty people attended, including Xiao Chuan, Hu Jianchun, and Ying Luxian. The resolutions were: (1) The chamber of commerce will send a letter to the Qianye Gonghui (guild of money shops) asking them to work together to maintain and restore remittances and not allow suspensions to occur again. (2) A circular will be sent to all guilds to inform all shops to prioritize the return of money to the Qianye and foreign firms in order to maintain the market. (3) In addition to normal payments, long-term deposits in each household will be limited to 300 yuan during the big closing period.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Department of Finance Rectifies Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has issued orders regarding the handling of brokerage firms that buy and sell on behalf of customers and the business firms that sell goods with their own capital, as well as the merchants who buy and sell goods for profit. The department is now issuing further clarifications to avoid misunderstandings, which may impact tax collection. All business firms holding broker's licenses are only allowed to extract commissions for buying and selling on behalf of customers. Those who sell goods with their own capital must still pay business tax. Merchants who sell goods through brokers must also pay business tax, which will be paid by the brokers on their behalf. Those who buy goods and transport them for sale elsewhere must also follow the regulations and pay business tax based on the value of the goods purchased. The tax rate will be collected separately according to the type of goods in accordance with the business tax rate table for the sale of goods. Currently, Anhui and other provinces are implementing these measures in accordance with central regulations. This province should also follow suit. The department has already issued orders to all counties to act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Provincial and Departmental Order to Clean Up Camp Grounds</h3>
<p>The camp grounds in the county seat have been managed by the Education Bureau. An order has been received from the provincial and departmental authorities to clean them up. The county has instructed the Education Bureau to submit a list and map of all previous tenants and to forward them. The Construction and Public Security Bureaus and the First District Office will jointly verify the seals and leases of the tenants. Remaining land that has not been disposed of will be jointly managed and cannot be used without authorization.</p>
<h3>National Goods Exhibition Extended by Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Because the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry will only be held in Yangzhou for half a month, which is not widespread enough for farmers in the four townships, the County Farmers Association sent a letter requesting that the exhibition be continued for two weeks after the original expiration date.</p>
<h3>Wujiang Departmental Order to Collect Additional Road Construction Mu Tax</h3>
<p>The county has been collecting four jiao per mu for road construction under the Mangxia item. Following repeated orders from the Department of Construction to collect the full five jiao according to the original plan, the county government ordered the Finance Bureau to collect an additional one jiao for road construction from the second term temple tax in the 21st year. The Department of Construction has approved the additional collection.</p>
<h3>County Agricultural Improvement Center Closed</h3>
<p>The County Agricultural Improvement Center has been ordered to temporarily close and to create a list of expenses, public property, and equipment and submit it to the county government for closing. The agricultural training school attached to the center will be closed after the end of the current semester during this year's winter vacation due to academic considerations.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob Sanlang Temple in Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Two bandit ships carrying over twenty bandits armed with guns arrived at Sanlang Temple in the ninth district of the county. After landing, they stormed into the home of Wu Youguang and ransacked it. Not finding what they wanted, they stole over two hundred ducks raised by Wu and fled.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Cargo Ship Robbed, Loss of 50,000 Gold</h3>
<p>Tongxingbeihao, a Ningbo firm located on Shuangjie Street in Jiangdong, specializes in soybean oil and other sundry goods. Last month, it chartered the Jinyuanshi sailboat in Zhenhai to Dalian to load over a thousand dan of soybeans and bring them to Ningbo. However, the ship was robbed by pirates in the Daxie sea area. The ship and cargo were stolen, and there has been no news of it since. The loss is over 50,000 gold.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Director Convicted of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Li Lingjun, the former director of the Zhenhai Education Bureau, and Dai Keqin, the accountant, jointly embezzled over 8,500 yuan of county funds and public bonds. The current director, Ding Chao, filed a lawsuit with the High Court, which ordered the local court of the county to handle the case. After investigation and prosecution, the criminal court of the court sentenced Li Lingjun and Dai Keqin to four months of imprisonment each for the crime of jointly embezzling business property.</p>
<h3>Couple in Xiaoshan Commit Suicide Due to Debt Pressure</h3>
<p>Shen Peichao, a farmer from Dongmenwaiqiao in Xiaoshan, was unable to repay his debts due to an illness that lasted two months this year. On the 13th, he unsuccessfully sought a loan from relatives at a rice shop in Linpu. Upon returning home, due to debt pressure, he committed suicide by hanging himself from a beam in the Liangting Pavilion on Yutoushan. His wife arrived to find her husband dead and threw herself into Xianghu Lake to kill herself. She was rescued by bystanders, but died soon after.</p>
<h3>Robbery on the Road During Snowstorm</h3>
<p>The Yichun Foreign Goods Shop in Wenyan, Benshan, was suddenly attacked by four armed robbers in the middle of the night on the 12th. They stormed in and robbed the store, stealing over 80 silver dollars and over 30 jiao of small coins from the cash register. By the time the store owner reported the robbery to the Public Security Bureau, the robbers had disappeared.</p>
<h3>Ship Crew Falsely Report Robbery After Stealing Funds</h3>
<p>Zheng Guoxian, a debt collector for the Dachangsheng Medicine Shop on Tangwan Street in Beicheng, Jiaxing, chartered a boat to collect debts from various locations. The boat was owned by Fan Er and manned by Shen Qida. The other day, after the boat departed from Xinmin and stopped at Zhongshi, Zou took the opportunity to go ashore to settle accounts with various shops. Before long, crew member Shen Qida reported that two robbers had robbed the boat. Zou immediately rushed back to the boat but saw no sign of the robbers. Upon checking the accounts, he found that 261 yuan had been stolen. He immediately reported the incident to the water police in Zhen, who dispatched investigators but found no trace of the robbers. Fan Er and Shen Qida were taken in for questioning, but their statements were inconsistent, suggesting that they had stolen the funds. Police were dispatched to search the boat and found two bundles of silver dollars, totaling 93 yuan, hidden in the canvas awning. The bundles were labeled with the names of the shops and the amount of debt owed. There was still 168 yuan missing. After further interrogation, Fan Er confessed that it had been sunk in the river. Zheng Guoxian, having falsely reported a robbery with conclusive evidence, requested that the case be sent to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Students from Anqing and Wuhu Collude to Escape with Funds and are Apprehended</h3>
<p>Due to a bribery case in Wuhu, Chen Zizheng, the chief of the judicial section of the Anhui Provincial Public Security Bureau, was suspended from his duties. The news caused a stir and rumors spread. After investigation, the following is a record of the beginning and end of the case: The Wuhu Tongyu Money Shop was opened by the Lu family from Jingde. The shop employed Lou Zhiwei, a student from Zhenjiang who was 19 years old. The other day, the shop owner ordered him to remit over 13,000 yuan to another port, but the student never returned. The shop owner, suspecting something was amiss, telegraphed the provincial public security bureau and various banks to detain him if he attempted to exchange money. The student went to the China Bank in the provincial capital and presented a foreign exchange note for 5,000 yuan, asking to remit it to Shanghai. The bank, having received the telegram, became suspicious and questioned him closely. The student, fearing he would be exposed, looked flustered and rushed towards the airport. The bank informed the provincial public security bureau by phone, and the debt collection team, led by Ye Songshan, went to the airport and arrested the student. After being interrogated by Chen Zizheng, the chief of the judicial section of the bureau, 9,200 yuan was recovered and temporarily stored in the bureau. The Wuhu Tongyu Shop then requested to handle the case themselves. The public security bureau then sent the arrested person and the stolen goods to Wuhu. However, after a retrial by the public security bureau, the student confessed that Chen Zizheng had embezzled 4,000 yuan. Zhang Benshun, the director of the bureau, had just returned to Anhui from Beijing and heard the news when passing through Wuhu. After returning to the province and investigating the matter, he suspended Chen from his duties. However, the debt collection team leader, Ye Songshan, suddenly disappeared, causing Zhang to become even more suspicious. He placed Chen under house arrest for further investigation. However, the key to the case is the discrepancy in the amount of money stolen. It is necessary to await the student's arrival in the province for questioning before the truth can be revealed.

In addition to resolving important cases, the following was announced: (A) A letter to all middle and high school students leaving school for winter vacation, the text of which is as follows: Beloved students, how quickly time flies, winter vacation is upon us again. Are you not preparing your luggage to leave school and return home? Now, the call of all things expresses the demand for resisting Japan and saving the nation. You should not hesitate to respond to this demand and strive and struggle. Our entire Northeast has been lost, the volunteer army is fighting heroically, Rehe and Qinhuangdao are in great danger, the soldiers are fighting hard, Shanhaiguan has fallen again, and North China is shaking.

<h3>Zhejiang Public Association Asks Chiang Kai-shek to Supervise the Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zhejiang Public Association telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Nanjing Military Committee, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: The Japanese atmosphere is pressing in, and the national situation is in danger. The whole country is uneasy, as if it cannot end the day. You created the Republic of China and have always regarded internal stability and external resistance as your mission. You cannot bear to see the great rivers and mountains fall into the hands of the island barbarians. Fortunately, you have divine power, and Hubei and Henan have been pacified. Now is the time to move the triumphant army, point the spears north, show the determination to resist, and fulfill the vow of resisting foreign aggression. Moreover, the Japanese ambition to annex Chinese territory has been completely exposed. The majestic passes and natural dangers have fallen into the hands of the violent army. The enemy cavalry is rampant and frequently approaches the suburbs of Pingjin. It is not only as far away as the Shen incident in the borderlands, or as close as the Shanghai turmoil in one corner, but it is still possible to negotiate and maintain peace. If we do not gather a large army to defend key points, the enemy army will advance an inch and take a foot. The entire territory of North China will not be ours. We also hope that you will go north on time, personally supervise the army, and issue orders nearby, so as to inspire morale and suppress public sentiment. Your prestige has always been respected and feared by the enemy. With one military regulation, the Xia people lost their courage. The signs of victory or defeat do not need to be determined. Recently, newspapers reported that Shang Zhen, Liu Zhennian, Wang Shuchang, and other generals who command troops are all vying to fight against Japan, which shows that morale is in command, the teacher is upright and strong, and using it to control the enemy, what enemy cannot be destroyed? Moreover, several of these units are elite troops who have experienced the Japanese war. It is appropriate to fulfill their loyal hearts and give them the task of confidants and mainstays, distribute them to strategic passes, and plan to recover lost territory. In particular, Liu Zhennian's division is known for its steadfastness and resilience. The Yexian campaign, although it was a civil war, showed the overview of their holding the city, trapped and persevering. Using it to fight against foreign enemies should be able to bravely kill the enemy. Recently, the transfer to Zhejiang is not their original intention, and Zhejiang is currently in peace, so there is no need for heavy troops to be stationed. Moreover, the people of Zhejiang are not familiar with the arrival of guest troops. There may be gaps between the army and the people. It is urgent to lead them north and personally go to the battlefield. They will surely live up to their appointment and achieve meritorious service and avenge the country. It is all in one fell swoop. The whole country is now looking forward to you, giving orders to dispatch troops, speed is of the essence, and quelling national disasters is a task for someone. Save the great catastrophe of foreign barbarians, comfort the yearning for a great drought. Looking forward to the festival, I can't help but feel attached. Shanghai Zhejiang Public Association kowtows, deleted.</p>
<h3>Park Bing-san's Speech as a Representative of Li Ming-xin</h3>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that Park (formerly misreported as Pu) Bing-san, the commander-in-chief of the Heilongjiang People's Army, and Deng Wen, the commander of the First Army of the Heilongjiang Righteous Army, have repeatedly made remarkable achievements in the Nenjiang, Hailun, and Keshan areas of Heilongjiang Province, making tens of thousands of enemy troops tired of running for their lives. Now, in order to change strategic plans, in addition to Deng's department of more than 10,000 people, who have detoured to the Rehe border, waiting for reinforcements, Park's entire department is still stationed in the Heilongjiang area, making a desperate struggle to implement their spirit of unyielding and unforgiving. Recently, he specially dispatched representative Li Ming-xin to Shanghai to contact all sectors for aid. Yesterday, the reporter of the Hua Dong News Agency visited him at the hotel and was told the details of the battle between Park and Deng, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Park's Army Situation</h3>
<p>Commander Park was originally the brigade commander of the Heilongjiang Infantry, that is, the reclamation army of Ma Zhanshan in the Jiangqiao battle, with an artillery regiment and four cavalry regiments. On October 15th, he took over as commander-in-chief of the People's Army, leading more than 15,000 people. On the 19th, he occupied Taian Town, a major town in the middle of the Chik Road. All 200 enemies were wiped out, and the people rejoiced. The Japanese were extremely angry and occupied on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Gouzi, then marched eastward and attacked Keshan (in the middle of the Qike Road and Huai Road). The enemy was guarded by seven or eight hundred people. After attacking for three days and nights, half of the city was captured. Three or four hundred enemies died, but they still resisted stubbornly, making solid burrows with machine guns mounted on the burrow mouths. It was not easy to attack the enemy inside, so a small number of infantrymen were left to guard. Commander Park led the team straight to the provincial capital. When he reached the landlord Yangjiatun, 60 miles away from the province, he encountered more than 400 enemy cavalrymen. He immediately opened fire, and the enemy was defeated and fled to Beizi Mansion. Park led the team to catch up, surrounded it on all sides, and fired guns and cannons together, wiping out the enemy. Only forty or fifty people escaped, and more than one hundred war horses, two mountain cannons, more than three hundred guns, and countless bullets were obtained. Morale was greatly boosted. He was planning to enter the province, but because the transportation agencies were all in the hands of the enemy, the enemy received the news and transferred more than 2,000 people from Jilin, Harbin, Changchun, and other places, and attacked our army's rear from the Huai Road. Park was forced to lead the team back and fought fiercely between Keshan, Taian Town, and Aolong Gouzi. There were several bloody battles where he gained and lost, and lost and gained. On the 27th, the enemy gradually increased, and our army ran out of ammunition and was isolated. Therefore, he retreated to Nehe and met with Ma Zhanshan. Ma Zhanshan handed over his seventeen brigades to Park Bing-san and appointed Park as the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route of the National Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Deng's Army Situation: Commander Deng Wen was originally the brigade commander of the Heilongjiang Cavalry. Since the September 18th Incident, he has expanded his army and now has 20,000 men. In May of this year, when the League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Harbin, Commander Deng wanted to make the truth clear to the Investigation Team and took the opportunity to attack the Songpu Station in northern Harbin, which is separated from Harbin by a river. Knowing that the strength was not enough, but in order to express the spirit of our nation, he attacked Songpu Station with Li Tiande, Chai Hongyou, etc., and fought bloodily for four nights, killing more than 500 enemies. Finally, due to the lack of troops and materials, he had to retreat to Hailun. The League of Nations Investigation Team sent personnel to Hailun to investigate the truth. At this time, Chairman Ma led the team from Daheihe to meet with them and take pictures. Ma Zhanshan and Commander Deng held a meeting to unite the righteous armies, summon the people of various counties, and organize anti-Japanese righteous armies. Before it was completed, the enemy again pressured Hailun with two divisions of troops. Ma Deng and others distributed the troops to various counties so that the enemy could not take care of it. In the month, Deng's</p>
<p>The army raided Hailun, the North Catholic Church, and Zhaojia Shop at night, causing three or four hundred casualties to the enemy. Until the Baiquan battle last month, it was the most fierce. Baiquan is a wealthy area of ​​Blackland. Due to the sudden cold weather and lack of cold-proof clothing for the soldiers, Commander Deng led the team to Baichai to prepare cold-proof clothing. The enemy found out and transferred a large number of troops from Jilin and Harbin and other places to attack in five directions. Commander Deng had defense lines in the east, west, north, and south of Bai, and received them at the same time. After three days and nights of bloody battle, he was forced to retreat due to running out of ammunition and food, and no cold clothes. Now Commander Deng leads 10,000 troops and has arrived in Rehe, waiting for replenishment of ammunition, clothing, and assistance. Once the replenishment is completed, he will return to Longjiang for a permanent resistance.</p>
<h3>The "Bengbu" Aircraft Flew Back to Shanghai from Peiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Took Off at 7:00 AM</p>
<p>Smooth Journey</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Peiping air route of China National Aviation Corporation was originally scheduled to officially open on the 10th, but was blocked by heavy fog on that day and flew back to Changshu. It was postponed to the 12th when the company's chief pilot An Lixun and the head of the aircraft maintenance group, Nie Kaiyi, drove the Bengbu aircraft to take off from Longhua. Due to the continuous wind and snow, it was difficult to reach Haizhou that day, and it was impossible to move forward. On the 13th, he flew from Haizhou to Qingdao and stopped. The day before yesterday, he flew from Qingdao to Peiping via Tianjin. Yesterday, the weather was clear. Chief Pilot An and Director Nie still drove the original plane and flew from Peiping to Shanghai. At 7:40 yesterday morning, he took off from Peiping and arrived at Tianjin Station in about 20 minutes. At 10:30, he arrived in Qingdao, and at 12:05 noon, he arrived in Haizhou. The journey was exceptionally smooth. He did not stop at Nanjing Station. At 2:40 in the afternoon, he safely arrived at Longhua Airport, bringing many letters and newspapers from Peiping and Tianjin to Shanghai. As for whether the Shanghai-Peiping line needs to increase flights and advance the passenger loading, it remains to be discussed by Director Nie and the China National Aviation Corporation authorities before a decision is made.</p>
<h3>Wusong Chamber of Commerce Letter to Encourage Donations to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>Save Spring Wine Money to Save the Country</p>
<p>The Wusong Chamber of Commerce Office yesterday announced to various businesses, encouraging them to save money on this year's spring wine and other expenses, and send it to the association to donate to purchase aircraft to prepare for resisting aggression. I hope that the merchants and people of Songdi will abide by the righteousness of every man's responsibility for the rise and fall of the country, and actively donate, which will be effective.</p>
<h3>Responsible Person's Talk</h3>
<p>Telephone Contract Negotiations Have Largely Been Concluded</p>
<p>The Method of Merging the Postal Savings Bureau Has Not Been Decided</p>
<p>Shareholders of China Merchants Bureau Criticized for Asking for Price Increase</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that Guan Tian had problems such as the telephone contract for Shanghai's Road Beyond the Boundary, the merger of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the reorganization of the debts of the China Merchants Bureau. The reporter stationed in Beijing of the Xin Sheng News Agency specially interviewed the responsible person of the Ministry of Communications yesterday and talked about the recent progress. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Telephone Beyond the Boundary</h3>
<p>According to Huang Xiuqing, the section chief of the fourth section of the Telecommunications Department in charge of telephone matters, the telephone contract for the road beyond the boundary was initially because the Bureau of Public Works intended to use the English version as the original and the Chinese version as the copy. After several negotiations, it was decided to change the Chinese version as the original. At present, the reason why the two parties have not immediately signed the agreement after negotiation is the negotiation of the wording of the Chinese version. It has been largely concluded in recent days and can be completely resolved within two weeks. The full text of the regulations has 19 articles, and the content will be announced after signing. It is reported that the general method is that those who install telephones in the area of ​​the road beyond the boundary are equally obliged to pay the Bureau of Public Works the monthly telephone fee for the concession. At the same time, the method of paying the Chinese Telephone Company every month is based on the distance of the connection, and the cost ranges from more than one yuan to more than four yuan per month. This cost is purely related to sovereignty and is a subsidy for the Chinese Telephone Company's connection. As for the northern section, which can be installed by the Chinese Telephone Company, the Bureau of Public Works plans to charge a connection fee of five cents each time when connecting. The Chinese side is planning to negotiate gradually and try to connect the telephone equipment on both sides of the Chinese Concession gradually. In the future, the method of five cents per connection will be discussed to cancel or reduce it, but this is not a problem with the contract itself. The reporter then asked about the call time for the renovation of automatic telephones in the north and south cities. According to Yunnan, the south city has decided to open the call in early February, while the north and south cities have suffered total loss of lines after January 28th, and the repair procedures are slightly complicated. It will be possible to open the call in early March.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings Merger</h3>
<p>The reporter then visited Shi Jiyin, the secretary of the Ministry of Communications, and asked about the situation of the merger of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau into the General Post Office. According to him, after repeated consideration by the Ministry of Communications, it is proposed to merge the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau into the General Post Office, but its business will still be separated, but the General Post Office has the power of command and supervision. Such development and reorganization are more convenient. The Postal Economic System Committee is currently waiting to agree on the method before making a decision. As for Yang Jianping, the director of the Remittance Bureau, resigning and Tang Baoshu succeeding him, it has nothing to do with the merger issue, because Yang has been saying it for a long time, and the department cannot but choose a replacement early. How the savings and remittance bureau will be merged in the future will be decided after the method is agreed upon, and then the revision of the organizational regulations of the General Post Office will be planned. The Ministry of Communications has not yet considered this.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Incident</h3>
<p>Shi continued, Guan Tian, ​​on the side of the China Merchants Bureau, the creditors are rumored to have requested to increase the number of compensation. The Ministry of Communications has not yet received this official document. This matter should be discussed and decided by the board of directors. As for the shareholders, a small part recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to increase the stock price, but this is an administrative decision and there is no way to change it. The Ministry of Communications can only criticize it.</p>
<h3>Four Ministries Meeting on Shanghai Station Relocation</h3>
<p>Still Follow the Ministry of Railways Plan</p>
<p>Nanjing Electric, the result of the discussion by the four ministries of the Railway, Real Estate, Military, and Internal Affairs on the relocation of the Shanghai station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is still in accordance with the plan of the Ministry of Railways to relocate the North Station to the Zhenru Pengpu area. The land price and mildew collection procedures have also been decided. It is reported that representatives of the four ministries will go to Shanghai this week to convene representatives from the Pengpu area to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Qingdao Long-Distance Telephone Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Sound is Quite Clear</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Qingdao long-distance telephone, which was planned and set up by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, officially started talking yesterday. However, because it is still the first time, there are only a few round-trip calls. It is expected that it can gradually increase in the future, and the sound is also quite clear.</p>
<h3>After the Disappearance of the Yulong Ship of Tongyu Company</h3>
<p>Loading Coal from Keelung and Not Seeing It for a Long Time</p>
<p>The Company Inquired by Radio and Still Found Nothing</p>
<p>Family Members of the Crew Pleaded with the Company for Relief</p>
<p>The Company Plans to Offer a Reward to Find the Whereabouts of the Ship</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the Yulong ship, represented by Tongyu Shipping Company, suddenly disappeared on December 8th after loading Hongji coal from Keelung. The company has inquired from all parties, and there has been no news so far. It is suspected that it has been lost and sunk. The family members of the crew are extremely panicked. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Process of Disappearance</h3>
<p>The Yulong ship has a deadweight of 2,400 tons. The owner is a Westerner, and the chief mate and old track are all Chinese. There are a total of 40 people. It is represented by Tongyu Shipping Company and has always sailed in Shanghai, Keelung, Haiphong, and other places, commonly known as the wild chicken class, carrying coal. At the end of November last year, it set sail from Shanghai to Keelung to load coal. By December 8th, it was fully loaded with Hongji coal and returned to Shanghai from Keelung. The scheduled voyage between Keelung and Shanghai is about one week each way. By the 15th, the company had not seen the ship arrive in Shanghai, which was very strange. They immediately sent telegrams to Keelung and other places to inquire, but there was no news.</p>
<h3>Suspected of Sinking</h3>
<p>After Chen Yisheng, the manager of Tongyu Company, inquired about the disappearance of the Yulong ship, he specially telegraphed the Hong Kong Radio Station, asking it to assist in the search by radio, but still did not receive a reply from the Yulong ship. It is suspected that the ship encountered a gust of wind on the way, has been lost and sunk, or was looted by pirates. By the 2nd of this month, the English Ping Company's ship at No. 29 Sichuan Road received the Yulong ship's radio in the middle of the voyage, only reporting its own ship name and asking the other ship's name. The English Ping ship immediately telegraphed a reply, but suddenly broke off. Based on this speculation, it is feared that it sank immediately when it was transmitting electricity, but according to the owner of the New Ping An ship, Arson, who is the brother of the owner of the Yulong ship, there are many ships coming to and from the line between Shanghai and Keelung. If the Yulong ship really sank, there would definitely be no evidence to date. It is feared that it was looted and the radio was dismantled, or it encountered a reef after being looted and sank.</p>
<h3>Family Panic</h3>
<p>The family members of the Yulong ship's crew have been in panic since they received the news of the ship's disappearance. At first, it was mistaken for a delay due to fog on the way, and then the company sent telegrams to inquire without any news. Therefore, they panicked and knew that there was little hope. Until this month, the trace of the Yulong ship was still not seen. The family members of the crew went to the company to inquire every day, and the number of people was endless. By the 10th, the family members said that it had been a month so far, and they were afraid that something had happened. They jointly went to the company to wait and begged for relief for days.</p>
<h3>Company Aftermath</h3>
<p>Tongyu Company has not heard from the Yulong ship so far, and the family members of the crew have been waiting for days and cannot be persuaded to leave. It has discussed the aftermath and decided to reply to the family members of the crew today. The reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency met with the company's personnel. According to the talks, the company decided to not only advise the family members of the crew, but also planned to post a reward in the newspaper immediately. If anyone knows the whereabouts of the Yulong ship, they will be rewarded handsomely.</p>
<h3>Today's Enlarged Memorial Week of the Municipal Party Department</h3>
<p>Each Group and Agency Sends Two Representatives</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in view of the worsening crisis, in order to enable all sectors to jointly recognize the work of saving the country, specially scheduled to convene all the city's agencies at 9:00 am today in the auditorium of the association on Linyin Road, Ximen, to hold an enlarged memorial week. The notification letter is recorded as follows: For notification, it is hereby decided to convene representatives from all sectors at 9:00 am on the 16th of this month (Monday) on the third floor of our party headquarters to hold an enlarged memorial week. It is hereby notified that all agencies, groups, schools, and party headquarters at all levels in the city are expected to send two representatives to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Xue Dubi Started Practicing Law Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Liejun and Others Went to Congratulate</p>
<p>Mr. Xue Dubi, a member of the Central Committee, started practicing law in Shanghai yesterday. The office is located at No. 38 Duoia Road. Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Ding Chaowu, Zhang Zhiben, and other members of the Central Committee went to congratulate him. Xue immediately issued a public statement, saying, "I have left the political world and changed to law this time, one is for peace of mind, and the other is to increase knowledge. Although I am a member of the Central Committee and the National Government Committee, I ask myself that I have no benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood. From now on, changing to a lawyer can use the law to advocate a bit more justice for the society and protect a bit more human rights, which is also a great pleasure. I have tasted the taste of being an official for many years. I have not only abandoned my personal learning, but also been separated from the people, as if I am in another society, which is painful. Now I am a lawyer and serve the people, so the people's conditions, people's hidden feelings, people's morals, people's wisdom, and all social conditions can be clearly understood, and I can concentrate on books to verify the career and academics with each other, with the hope of increasing personal knowledge. My humble aspiration lies here. Among relatives and friends, there are quite a few who dissuade me from being a lawyer, but I think that things depend on people, and cannot be generalized. If you are an official, greedy and not diligent, the society will scold you, or even more than a bad lawyer. If you are a lawyer and can act in good conscience, advocate justice, and protect human rights according to law, why can't you be trusted by the society? It all depends on the individual's reputation, so I still intend to try it out. As for some people saying that I resigned because I was angry at the time, I don't think so."</p>
<h3>The County Government Intensifies Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Four Supplementary Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has issued measures for winter defense in this county by the Public Security Section, and has ordered the public security bureaus to handle them. Now, in order to intensify defense and prevent rampant bandits, County Magistrate Yan yesterday summoned the heads of the public security bureaus to the county, and gave them face-to-face instructions, asking them to effectively prevent them, and Section Chief Yao of the Public Security Section also supplemented four measures: (1) In addition to the second bureau still adhering to the original joint defense method and effectively patrolling, the remaining bureaus should immediately invite the Baoan Team to discuss joint defense patrol methods and report to the county for record. (2) The bureau chief will select police officers and divide them into two groups to investigate the people in the shanty towns and second households in the jurisdiction, and obtain joint guarantee certificates, one original and one copy, and send the original to the county for record. (3) When investigating, we must carefully investigate those who have vagrants and no support, and should follow the fourth provision of the four measures resolved by the 13th Standing Committee of the Provincial Security Committee to expel them back to their hometowns. (4) Nearby bureaus should hold joint defense meetings and whistles, and the English date and number of times and locations should be decided by the bureau chiefs and reported for approval.</p>
<h3>City Center Original Property Owners: City Government Orders Payment of Certificates and Receipt of Land Price</h3>
<p>Submit to the Land Bureau by the End of February</p>
<p>The city government, in order to urge the original property owners in the city center area to submit their property certificates and receive land prices, issued a public notice yesterday stating that the City Center Area Construction Committee proposed and the Land Bureau sent a letter stating that for the land within the first requisition area, after the redistribution, the property evidence of the original property owners should be submitted uniformly and the land price received. Despite repeated deadlines, few property owners have complied. Currently, the land occupation permits for land recipients within the requisition area urgently need to be issued. How should this be handled? The committee held a special meeting on the 29th of this month and resolved on four measures: (1) The city government will issue a public notice urging those property owners and tenants who have not submitted their documents to do so before the end of February of the 22nd year of the Republic. Submit the documents to the Land Bureau and receive the land price. If they fail to meet the deadline, their held documents will be announced as valid only for receiving the land price and will not have any other effect. (2) The city government will order the Land Bureau to separately inform the relevant leaders to urge the tenants to receive the price, and notify the local security to urge the property owners to receive the price. (3) If any property owners and tenants still fail to submit their documents to the Land Bureau by the deadline, the city government will send the list to all levels of courts, stating that the documents of these property owners and tenants will only be valid for receiving the land price and will not have any other effect. (4) Land recipients who have paid all land prices before the end of December of last year, if the issuance of certificates is delayed due to the delayed submission of documents by the original property owners and tenants, the Land Bureau may temporarily issue temporary certificates for them to manage the property first. After the procedures are clear in the future, official land occupation permits will be reissued. Are the above provisions appropriate? The government has already decided to proceed with the 225th municipal meeting. After the redistribution of land in the first and second Taichiyuan districts in the city center, the property evidence of the original property owners should be submitted uniformly and the land price received in order to conclude the matter. The Land Bureau has repeatedly drawn maps and issued public notices ordering compliance, but to date, few property owners have complied with the submission of documents and receipt of land prices. In addition to ordering the Land Bureau to comply with the resolution, a public notice is hereby issued urging those property owners and tenants who have not submitted their documents to comply and submit all documents to the Land Bureau before the end of February of the 22nd year of the Republic to receive the land price. If they delay any further, their held documents will be declared as valid only for receiving the land price and will not have any other effect. Do not hesitate and delay yourselves. This is the notice.</p>

<h3>[Inauguration of the Director of the National Medical Branch Yesterday Morning]</h3>
<p>Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Medical Center, Presided Over the Oath Ceremony and Delivered Instructions</p>
<p>Shenshi Telegraph Agency, Local News: Feng Bingnan, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central National Medical Center, and Deputy Directors Shen Zhuanru and Ding Zhongying, held a swearing-in ceremony at 9:00 am yesterday at the branch located in Changfeng Lane, Tongfu Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Medical Center, Deputy Directors Shen Zhuanru and Ding Zhongying of the Shanghai Branch, Chairman of the Board Lu Zhong'an, Executive Directors Xia Yingtang, Fang Jiaobo, Cai Jiping, Xie Liheng, Directors Chen Cunren, Bo Liang, Yin Zhenyi, Xiao Tui'an, Xu Xiangren, Gu Weichuan, Jing Yunfang, Fang Gongpu, Zhao Yongbai, Feng Zhengming, Jiang Wenfang, Xue Wenyuan, Hu Juran, Zhu Nanshan, Ding Jiwan, Li Xuchuan, Wang Zhongqi, Zhang Zanchen, and guests Ye Gongchuo, Dai Ji (represented by Dai Yao), Pan Feizhan (represented by Chen Songchun), and more than 150 others.</p>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony: The meeting began at 9:00 am, chaired by Lu Zhong'an, Chairman of the Board, who reported on the establishment of the branch and future development plans. Then, the director and deputy directors took the oath of office (Director Feng was absent due to illness). Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Medical Center, presided over the oath ceremony and delivered instructions, stating that Shanghai is a trading port between China and foreign countries, and the focus of attention from all over the world. Our country's inherent medicine has always been valued by all parties. Now, the joint establishment of a branch by the medical and pharmaceutical fields is of great significance and heavy responsibility. He hoped that the newly appointed director would work with all colleagues to organize traditional Chinese medicine using scientific methods, in order to achieve the center's goal of saving people and the country. Subsequently, Commander Dai, Director Pan, and representatives from the Chinese National Medical Association, Shanghai National Medical Association, and Shenzhou National Medical Association delivered speeches. The ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>General Arrangement: The hall of the branch was decorated with the national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and the arrangement was quite neat and solemn. In addition, a special exhibition room was set up, displaying various Chinese medicine products from the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, hundreds of charts of human physiology, and dozens of specimens of medicinal materials. Among them, the most brilliant was the five-color atlas of medicinal materials compiled by Chen Cunren, a director of the branch. It is said that there are more than 2,000 kinds of color illustrations, covering almost all Chinese medicinal materials, and they are prepared to be included in Chen's "Chinese Materia Medica Dictionary."</p>
<p>Inauguration Declaration: Feng Bingnan, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central National Medical Center, issued an inauguration declaration yesterday, stating that the establishment of the Shanghai National Medical Branch of the Central National Medical Center has made Bingnan the director of the branch. He believes that this matter is of great importance and difficult to start. Bingnan has not studied medicine or pharmacy, and he feels unworthy of the position. He has repeatedly declined the offer. However, Director Jiao of the Central Center mistakenly adopted the false reputation and firmly refused to resign, and gentlemen from the medical and pharmaceutical circles visited one after another, urging him to accept the position. Bingnan is engaged in many affairs and has no time to spare. It is difficult to lead concurrently. Instead of bearing the false name, it is better to be cautious at the beginning. He expressed his sincerity and refused repeatedly. However, Director Jiao urged him even more and said to Bingnan that the preparation of this matter has been hindered for many years, all because of the selection of personnel. If Bingnan is appointed, his colleagues will praise and agree. If he refuses again, it will be delayed again due to the selection of personnel. Bingnan had no choice but to reluctantly accept the position. Bingnan's ambition is that he is happy to do anything that is beneficial to the public, even at his own expense. If it is not beneficial to the public, he will never do it. This matter will not harm him, but how can it be beneficial to the public? He asked himself and had no plan. He did not dare to expect how to achieve results in the future. Therefore, he recounted the circumstances of his appointment and informed the people of the country, hoping for their understanding. He recalled that when the museum order was first issued, people came to visit him every day, some taught him about grand plans, and some encouraged him with public welfare. The benefit of the compass needle is that Wei Pei has the resources. The only thing that touches him is several points. He believes that the medical and pharmaceutical industries have rarely been linked, and it is not easy to seek improvement. This is the first wish that his colleagues will sincerely unite to promote traditional Chinese medicine and medicine. He has heard that doctors have different banners and separate factions. He believes that medical skills are called benevolence, and the duty lies in practicing the Tao. Since the goals are the same, they should not be clearly divided from each other. They must jointly study and improve. This is the second deep wish that doctors can cooperate consistently. He has also heard that the situation in the pharmaceutical industry is even more complicated. The establishment of shops and trade is unrelated to each other. The work of preparation and the skill of refinement are guarded by each family, no different from secret records. It is necessary to know that hundreds of herbs have different properties, all in the application. Thousands of shops are independent, all for the manufacture of medicine. If there is an invention, it should be followed together. If there are disadvantages, it should be removed together. Although it is called trade, it is ultimately related to helping the world. This is the third wish that the pharmaceutical industry can break down the barriers of sects and jointly discover the hidden secrets of medicine. In recent times, Western medicine has spread to China, and the benefits of knives and the precision of dissection can be said to be beautiful. However, the wonders of traditional Chinese medicine also have special strengths, and the abundance of Chinese medicine is even more widely used. Western medicine has entered China for a short time, and traditional Chinese medicine has been practiced in China for a long time. If it is said that the latecomers surpass the predecessors and can be taken to replace them, why is the population of China more prosperous than that of other countries in the world? This is a clear effect and great verification. However, learning is never enough, and taking the advantages and making up for the shortcomings can be passed on for a long time. This is the fourth wish that Chinese and Western medicine can join hands and jointly reach the realm of longevity. Combining these four points is what Bingnan feels and wishes to tell the people of the country, and especially believes that all my medical and pharmaceutical colleagues should go to one goal and do their best to promote what they have learned and their aspirations, and especially to improve Chinese medicine. This is also the outline of the four points. As for disputes, they often arise from right and wrong, and right and wrong often arise from meetings. Now that the National Medical Center has been established, then all opinions will be centralized and discussed publicly, then misunderstandings will naturally have no reason to arise, right and wrong will have no reason to arise, and disputes will naturally have no reason to be seen. Moreover, things related to public welfare should not have disputes. Only care about public welfare, and nothing else. Opinions will naturally disappear. Although this has not happened yet, Bingnan secretly worries about it in advance, and hopes to be careful with his colleagues. The Central National Medical Center earnestly improves Chinese medicine with science and shows it to the public. He believes that the definition of science is to exhaust its principles. Exhausting the principles means exhausting its principles and putting them into practical use. Exhausting its principles to the endless, changing with each passing day, and inventions are also endless. In other words, it is organized knowledge. Moreover, in ancient China, although there was no name of science, in fact, the way of taking the pulse, based on the six pulses to diagnose the location of the disease, this kind of invention can be said to be a scientific invention. However, why can the six pulses be used to diagnose the disease? Few people understand why. This is like failing to go further and exhaust its principles. The principles of philosophy and scientific principles are the same. The learning of the ancients to investigate things and extend knowledge is its obvious evidence. In short, exhausting the principles is not about pursuing empty talk, but about achieving practical results. Those who study medicine should combine the meaning of investigating things and extending knowledge, exhausting principles and applying them with what is called science in modern times. The truth of things in the universe, how can it not be first invented from medicine? Moreover, Chinese medicine has a long history, from Emperor Shennong to modern times, there have been many inventions. Japan has never had medicine. During the Sui Dynasty, they sent people to various parts of Fujian, China, to study medicine. To this day, it is still called Chinese medicine. Although they admired Western medicine after their restoration, Chinese medicine has also made progress because of this. It can be seen that Chinese medicine needs to be improved urgently. The only thing is that the nature and habits are the same, and it has become a trend. Westerners are good at exhausting the principles and adopting different strengths, so their inventions far exceed those of China. The Chinese are complacent and confined to the established methods. Even if there are inventions, they have not yet been obvious. As for compatibility with different strengths, it is even more rare. He believes that it is necessary to correct these long-standing habits in order to integrate and develop them. Although, responsibility cannot be unclear. Medicine is related to human life and is of utmost importance. Its power is almost far greater than the judiciary. If the judicial hearing is unfair, it can still be appealed for remedy. If medicine is not careful, the dead cannot be resurrected and the dead cannot be continued. Even if you want to remedy it, you can't do anything. Moreover, its relationship to the strength of the nation and the length of the country's life is very important. What is the responsibility of those who study medicine? Therefore, what I hope for from my colleagues is to save the world as the main purpose and to do good in the industry as the duty, and especially to make the people of the country aware of the way of health and hygiene. Confucius said that he knew about life, Lao Tzu said that he lived long, and Zhuang Tzu said that he nourished life. All of them mean to seek the way to nourish life. The theory of health and hygiene has been around in China for a long time, and Confucius especially valued hygiene. Bo Niu suffered from leprosy and did not enter his room. He did not eat tainted wine, did not eat tainted meat, did not eat fish, did not eat rotten meat, did not eat bad colors, did not eat bad smells, did not eat spoiled food, and did not eat untimely food. Ji Kangzi gave medicine, and he did not dare to taste it until it arrived. The interpreter said that the arrival means that the medical theory has not been reached. Confucius was holy, and his diet must be careful and his medical theory must be reached. They are all for hygiene. The people of the country have been ignorant of hygiene for a long time. Those who rely on awakening the people of the country are those who study medicine. A careless meal can cause disease, and a missed medicine can lead to life. The ancients combined medicine and food, so it is hygienic. Those who rely on awakening the people of the country and making them aware of hygiene are those who study medicine. Moreover, there is even more progress. Ancient proverbs called doctors practitioners, praised them as benevolent, and called them doctors. The so-called practitioners are just practicing the Tao of benevolence, treating people's diseases with the Tao of benevolence, and hoping that they will live long. Therefore, those who study medicine can truly save the world as the main purpose and improve it as the duty, so that Chinese medicine will become more prosperous, and the people will know hygiene, then the reproach of the sick man of East Asia can be avoided, and the metaphor of a good minister can live up to its name. The National Medical Branch is not a false establishment. Therefore, organizing Chinese medicine and making it more advanced, melting all strengths and developing it, are especially the humble hopes that I have been looking forward to day and night, and from now on, I would like to encourage my colleagues to work together. I sincerely express my intentions and dare to tell the people of the country, hoping for guidance.</p>

<h3>Establishment of Liaoning Volunteer Army Medical Team</h3>
<p>Hualianshe, local news on the 15th: Geng Jizhou, commander-in-chief of the 4th Route of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, recently reported that the situation on the border of Rehe is critical.

<h3>Italian Silk Expert Maria Inspects Various Silk Factories in Zhenze</h3>
<p>He Greatly Appreciates the Equipment and Products</p>
<p>Dr. Maria, an Italian silk expert and representative of the League of Nations, arrived in Zhenze Town on the afternoon of January 10th, accompanied by Ni Zhaotai, an officer of the National Economic Commission.

It is reported that Dr. Maria was satisfied with all the factory silk from Kaixian Gong and Zhenfeng, and the Zhili warp, Su warp, and Guang warp produced by various silk firms. He especially appreciated the complete organization, economic equipment, exquisite products, and effective mulberry planting of the Kaixian Gong Silk Cooperative. It is also reported that the doctor believes that the luster and smoothness, pulling force and toughness of the Zhili warp are superior to those of factory silk, and he intends to suggest that the Chinese government actively promote it and further improve it, so as to prevent the original specialty from disappearing.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeks Information on Profit Distribution Practices of Businesses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the profit distribution methods are different, so yesterday it specifically notified the industry associations to seek information on the industry practices. The original letter said: Dear Sir, I am writing to you because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Shanghai Woolen and Silk Industry Association, stating that the ordinary commercial firms are accustomed to setting aside a certain amount from the surplus each year and depositing it as a public reserve fund. This public reserve is almost entirely included in the capital under the limited liability company, but there is no set practice in ordinary shops. If a dispute arises due to the accumulation of money, what should be done? The following questions are proposed, hoping for an answer: (1) What is the difference between the nature of the public reserve fund in a limited liability company and an ordinary shop? Can it be regarded as capital in an ordinary shop? (2) Does the public reserve fund include the interests of the shop assistants? (3) If it is determined that there are shop assistant interests, how should it be distributed and how should the time effect be distinguished? (4) If a shareholder and a shop assistant in employment, or a retired partner, can demand a share during the business period? (5) When the shop is in debt, should the public reserve be used to offset it, and should the shop assistant's interests be excluded? (6) If the distribution of the public reserve endangers the business foundation of the shop, how should it be remedied? (7) If the shop assistants have the right to share the public reserve fund, how should the apprentices who have not completed their studies (formerly known as apprentices) and the apprentices who have just completed their studies be distributed? The above points and ambiguities are requested to be clarified by your association to provide a basis for compliance. After the investigation, it was submitted to the twenty-fifth standing committee meeting for discussion. The meeting believes that the various points of profit distribution inquired by the association are of great importance to the interests of merchants. There are many businesses in the city, and the business operations are different, so it is impossible to generalize. The meeting decided to send a letter to each industry association to solicit information on record. Accordingly, I am sending you a copy of the letter, and I hope that you will refer to the points mentioned in the letter and reply to the meeting in detail according to the practice of your industry, so that the meeting can review and verify it.</p>

<h3>China Goods Review Society Certifies Golden Lion Thermos as Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The China Goods Review Society, located at Huashun Lane on Tongfu Road, was founded in the 14th year of the Republic (1925) as a public opinion organ for the domestic goods industry. Recently, due to reports in the newspaper that the Golden Lion Thermos produced by the Zhao Jin Ji Machinery Factory in Oujia Road and Oujiali lacked the necessary equipment for a thermos factory and was falsely claiming to be a member of the domestic goods factory association and selling Japanese inner bottles, raising suspicions of unscrupulous merchants, the Society sent a special investigator to conduct an on-site investigation of the factory. The investigation found that the Golden Lion Thermos shells were manufactured at the old address of the Zhao Jin Ji Machinery Factory in Oujia Road and Oujiali, while the inner bottle factory was located at 303 Jiugeng Lane on Miller Road, and they were purchasing glass blanks from the Chinese-owned New China Glass Factory to manufacture themselves. Therefore, the Golden Lion Thermos can be considered entirely domestic goods. As for the membership of the domestic goods factory association, there should be no problem as long as the membership procedures are complete. To promote domestic goods and protect real industries, the Society has issued a special certification in its fourth volume, first issue, to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Association Statistics on Abuse Cases for Last Month</h3>
<p>In addition to handling child abuse cases, the Protection Department of the China Child Welfare Association also pays attention to news of child abuse cases, whether obtained from newspapers, communications, or investigations. In December of last year, there were a total of 153 cases. Due to the winter season, there were only three cases of girls being raped, fewer than during the amorous spring season of last year. The number of children kidnapped reached as many as twelve, and the number of children trafficked was also twelve. The number of maids abused was eighteen. This is actually because the severe cold season provides a unique opportunity for such incidents to occur. The number of children lost was only 75, a decrease of over 200 from June of last year. This is also because children go out less in winter than during the summer wanderings in the streets. Other cases, such as children burned to death, of which there were nine (also due to the abundance of flammable materials in winter), and children run over by vehicles, of which there were only six (no doubt because children go out less often), are representative of the issues. Also, cases such as children committing suicide, children forced into prostitution, pregnant women being hit, and children being abandoned, etc., only occurred three or four times each. Furthermore, these types of cases occurred most often in the Public Concession, followed by the French Concession, and then the Chinese area. As for kidnappings in other locations, the proportion is extremely small. This is also because the number of cases is closely related to the prosperity of commerce and the size of the population. The Department's attention to these statistics is not just for record-keeping but also to examine the causes, study the results, and implement prevention and fundamental protection measures.</p>
<h3>Qingchang Inland River Ferry Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The weather has been cold and snowy for days, affecting wheeled transportation. Although the snow stopped yesterday, the climate is still bitterly cold. The narrow river surfaces of the inland rivers have been frozen by the cold, causing several inland river ferries to temporarily suspend operations. It is understood that the Qingyang Port to Changshu ferry, which connects to the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway to transport passengers, has also temporarily suspended operations today due to the river surface freezing. The Shanghai Railway is also selling through tickets to Changshu. Operations will resume as usual once the weather warms up and the river thaws.</p>

<h3>Major Fire in Yangjiazhai, Pudong</h3>
<p>Seven bungalows reduced to ashes</p>
<p>Seven bungalows in Lane 74 of Yangjiazhai, Pudong, suddenly caught fire last night around 7:00 PM. After an hour, they were all reduced to ashes. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Household Investigation: There are seven tiled bungalows in Lane 74, Houshang Street, Yangjiazhai, Pudong. The owner is a local resident, Gu Fufu, 61 years old. He used to be a carpenter at the British American Tobacco factory but has now retired. His residence is at 84 Houshang Street, connected to 74th Street, where the fire occurred. The seven rooms in the lane are rented out to others, forming two rows facing each other. The row facing south has four rooms: No. 1 is occupied by Ji Shengyun from Jiangbei; No. 2 is occupied by Cao Jinrong from Jiangbei; No. 3 is occupied by Yao Bailang from Chongming; and No. 4 is occupied by Zhao A'san from Jiangbei. The row facing north has three rooms: No. 5 is occupied by Zhao Qi Dai from Jiangbei; No. 6 is occupied by Cao Derong from Tongzhou; and No. 7 is occupied by Cao Jinrong from Jiangbei (from the same family as No. 2).</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Fire: At 7:15 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the row facing north. Flames burst through the roof instantly, and the fire was very fierce. The three rooms in that row were completely destroyed in short order, and the fire spread to the row facing south across the street. At that time, the Pudong District Fire Brigade received the alarm and immediately dispatched several pump trucks to the scene. They put the hoses into the nearby small creek and vigorously pumped water to fight the fire. However, because the fire was raging, they were unable to extinguish it immediately. After a while, the four rooms in that row were also destroyed one after another. The flames from the row facing north even burned part of the second story of the house owner</p>
<p>Gu Fufu's residence behind the bungalows. Fortunately, the firefighters were able to pour water effectively, so the entire residence was saved. After the row facing south was burned,</p>
<p>the fire did not spread to the neighboring houses. It took until 9:00 PM last night for the fire to be extinguished. However, the interior of the fire scene was still burning fiercely, so the firefighters had to continue pouring water for a long time to completely extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>The Arsonist Flees: When the fire was raging, the local Third District Police Station immediately dispatched Patrolman Liu Huansheng and Police Officer Guo Yongliang to the scene to maintain order. Captain Yuan of the Second Police Squad also led police to the scene to patrol. Members of various local defense groups also rushed to protect the area. According to the Third District's investigation, the fire started in No. 6, the home of the arsonist Cao Derong (nicknamed Little Fatty), from Tongzhou, who works as a laborer in the warehouse of the British American Tobacco factory. After the incident, he fled in fear of punishment and disappeared without a trace. As for the cause of the fire, it is said that Cao was cooking porridge at home when he became careless, causing the disaster. It is also said that a child was burned to death in the fire, but this has yet to be confirmed. Afterwards, the district sent Zheng Rongting, an old fireman from Shunxing Garden behind the fire scene, to the district to be questioned about the circumstances of the fire, to verify the information. Meanwhile, police were dispatched to investigate the arsonist and bring him to justice. As for the families who were burned out of their homes, they all sat on the open space near the fire scene last night, crying loudly, homeless and in a state of extreme misery.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Setting Off Firecrackers During the Abolished Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>Director Wen of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau recently noted that during the abolished Lunar New Year, the customs of the people are difficult to eradicate, and there are still people worshipping gods and setting off firecrackers. At a time of winter defense, repeated announcements have been issued prohibiting the setting off of firecrackers. However, ignorant citizens have outwardly complied but secretly disobeyed, still setting off firecrackers to worship gods. Yesterday, he specially ordered all district and local stations to instruct residents in their jurisdictions to prohibit the setting off of firecrackers to avoid misunderstandings. Those who violate this rule will be punished without leniency.</p>

<h3>Patriotic Youth Commits Suicide by Jumping into the River</h3>
<p>Participated in Anti-Japanese Resistance During Last Year's Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>Accumulated Frustration Over National Affairs Has Led to Illness</p>
<p>The Words in His Letter to His Mother Are Extremely Heartbreaking</p>
<p>Around 10:00 PM the night before, a young man crossed from Puxi to Pudong in a small sampan. When he reached the middle of the river, he jumped into the water. The current was rapid, and the boatman was unable to rescue him. His body has not been recovered to this day. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Illness from Worrying About the Nation</h3>
<p>The deceased, whose name was Zhong Nai Zi, was from Guangdong and came to Shanghai to study. He was 21 years old and lived in the Youth Apartment in Hongkou. When the January 28th Incident occurred last year, he dropped out of school and joined the Volunteer Army, personally going to the front lines to fight. After the Shanghai War was settled and our troops were sent to Fujian to suppress bandits, the Volunteer Army was disbanded. He then returned to Shanghai. He organized a National Salvation Anti-Japanese Assassination Group and spared no effort in promoting national salvation work in the Hongkou area. Now, Zhong has become ill from accumulated frustration. It seems that he is mad and not mad. Recently, with the loss of Yuguan and North China on the brink of danger, he was even more stimulated.</p>
<h3>Jumping into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Around 10:00 PM the night before, Zhong hired Zhou Xiao San's sampan in Puxi to cross to Pudong, stating that the fare was $1.20. Zhong paid the fare and boarded the boat. Unexpectedly, when the sampan reached the middle of the Huangpu River, Zhong, taking advantage of the boatman's inattention, jumped into the river. At that time, the current was rapid, and in a flash, Zhong's body was no longer visible. The boatman tried to retrieve him but to no avail.</p>
<h3>Heartbreaking Suicide Note</h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the sampan was searching for the body at the original location, but there was no success. When Zhong jumped into the Huangpu River, he left behind a bag of clothes and a letter to his mother. The words in the letter were painful and unbearable to read. The letter is transcribed as follows: The letter was addressed and sent to the He Zhen Xiang Wine Shop in Shantou, Guangdong, to be forwarded to Zhong Nai'an's home. The letter read: "Mother, my Great China's Northeast has been ceded, and Yuguan has fallen. Life is meaningless. I am forced to sacrifice myself. I hope you will live peacefully at home and not be saddened by my death. All my clothes have been pawned for food and lodging in Shanghai. I respectfully report this to you and wish you happiness and peace. Your son, Nai'an." The boatman has already mailed this letter.</p>
<h3>Nine Years of Acquaintance Ends in Hostility</h3>
<p>Madame Yuan Xu, a widow from Chuansha, Pudong, is 42 years old and resides in Pingyuanfang, Rue Jausse, French Concession. Her husband passed away early. She became acquainted with Zhou Wenyuan (29 years old), a fellow townsman and ticket seller No. 335 at the French Tramway Company, nearly nine years ago. The widow has a daughter named Pingfang, who is 29 years old and of some beauty. She was once a concubine to Yu A'gen, a foreman in the machinery department of the French Water and Electricity Company. Unexpectedly, her daughter recently had a falling out with A'gen, leading to family discord. It is rumored that the mother has now filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing A'gen of rape and seeking a divorce. Zhou Wenyuan, who knew the family, tried to reason with the widow, but she instead became enraged day and night. Furthermore, she gathered more than ten people, and on the afternoon of the previous day at about 1 p.m., invited Zhou Wenyuan to the Qingyun Teahouse on Caishi Street in the French Concession, ostensibly to "have a talk." She extorted more than 50 silver dollars. Zhou and others were dissatisfied and have hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court according to the law.</p>
<h3>Unfortunate Brothers</h3>
<p>Each Sentenced to Three Months for Operating an Opium Den</p>
<p>Lu Dagong, a Chinese detective of the General Inspectorate, learned that someone was operating an opium den at No. 17, Chungeng Lane, West Chessboard Street, providing opium for people to smoke. He led Chinese detective No. 1765 and others to investigate and raid the premises. They apprehended two brothers from Nanjing, Xu Bingsen and Xu Bingkun, as well as Binglin's wife, Zhou, on the upper floor of the house. They confiscated one opium pipe, two opium lamps, some opium, forty gambling papers, two opium ledgers, and a detective license No. 16 for the Jiangsu River Police stationed in Shanghai, belonging to Xu Bingsen, along with a pair of handcuffs. All were taken back to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, filed a public prosecution based on Articles 10 and 11 of the Anti-Opium Law, Article 280 of the Criminal Law concerning the sale and consumption of opium, and the crime of gambling. Detective Lu submitted a report detailing the circumstances of the raid. Xu Bingsen confessed that he had previously served as a detective in various police districts but had now been dismissed. He denied operating an opium den. Xu Bingkun admitted to smoking opium but denied operating an opium den. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confessions and announced the verdict in court: Xu Bingsen and Xu Bingkun were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment and fined 100 yuan. Xu Zhou was found not guilty. The opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Bureau Values Its Reputation</h3>
<p>Asks for Strict Punishment of Imposters</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Ocean Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry for the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region stated that the Administration's Fishery Protection Force had previously established temporary offices in Songhu, Zhapu, Dinghai, Ningxiang, Nanzhenhai, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Tongzhou, and Haizhou to manage fishery administration. However, due to the ineffectiveness of the force, all temporary offices were abolished successively on October 6th and December 14th of last year, and the personnel were dismissed accordingly. At the same time, the temporary offices in Songhu, Zhapu, Ningxiang, Nanzhenhai, Tongzhou, and Wenzhou were abolished. The remaining temporary offices in Dinghai, Taizhou, and Haizhou were also ordered to be abolished on December 30th of last year, with a deadline for completion. However, many places outwardly complied but secretly disobeyed, using the Administration's name to engage in deception. This not only hinders local public order but also damages the reputation of the Administration. Therefore, yesterday, separate notices were sent to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments and various municipal governments, requesting that if any of the above-mentioned situations are discovered, strict legal action be taken to deter illegal activities, ensure the safety of fishermen, and it has been reported to the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Progress of Fire Insurance Claims</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoting Extends Invitation to a Banquet for Consuls</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claims Association, because foreign insurance companies have refused to compensate claims, and have not clarified relief measures, and do not work with Chinese insurance companies to raise public debt, which angers all the insured victims, and therefore resolutely continue to seek compensation from various foreign insurance companies, and use appropriate means to achieve the purpose of compensation. Although the Fire Insurance Claims Association has petitioned various party and government agencies in the city several times, ordering foreign insurance companies to resolve the issue quickly, it has ultimately been ineffective. The association resolved at New Year's to elect more than ten people from the compensation committee, and on the 4th went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition, and were received by the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaoting, who expressed his assistance, and scheduled a banquet for consuls from the United States and other countries in Shanghai on the 14th to persuade foreign insurance companies to deal with the matter. Wang said he would visit the consuls first, and then invite them, fearing that there would not be enough time, so he has extended the date to the 18th of this month, and will hold a banquet for the consuls at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. At that time, he will persuade foreign insurance companies not to take extreme measures, and the Chamber of Commerce Fang Jiaobo will inform the Claims Association for their information. It is heard that the insured victims are approaching the end of the lunar year, and are suffering from hunger and cold, and cannot bear it. Yesterday, they went to the association to request and wrote to the Claims Committee to lead the claim, so that all the insured victims can temporarily negotiate with the foreign merchants.</p>

<h3>Russian Man's Car Accident Case: Sentence Reduced on Appeal</h3>
<p>A Russian man named Bai Xideng, also known as Bai Ke Ding (transliteration), residing at No. 1, Lane 2230, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, drove his own car out on the morning of September 5th last year at about 10:00 a.m. He was driving from west to east on Route Lafayette when, due to the driver's carelessness, he hit Chen Yongxiang, a roadside electrician, who was killed. He also injured Zhao Jiurong and Ji Malan, carters from Tongzhou. The body of the deceased was examined by the court prosecutor and collected by the family. The injured were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the police. Subsequently, the police sent the defendant Bai Xideng to the Second Special District Court, filing a public prosecution according to law. The victims also hired lawyers to file incidental private lawsuits seeking compensation for their losses. At the conclusion of the hearing on November 22nd, Bai Xideng was sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment and ordered to compensate Chen Zhang 1,300 yuan, Zhao Jiurong 800 yuan, and Ji Malan 500 yuan. It is now learned that the defendant, dissatisfied with the public prosecution portion of the judgment, hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The appeal has been concluded, and the original judgment regarding the criminal portion has been reversed. Bai Xideng is sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be counted as two days offsetting one day of imprisonment.</p>

<p>[P Tong Qiaogu Loses Her Virginity to Her Adoptive Father and Is Abused by Bad People&gt;</p>
<p>Almost Sold for the Third Time</p>
<p>Escapes Home and Her Father Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Tong A'niu, a 44-year-old from Xiaoshan County, Shaoxing, has recently hired lawyers Mi Jingshen and Liu Bin to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Zhu Jinde and Zhang Zhuxi from Ningbo of abducting and raping his daughter, Tong Qiaogu (also known as Yuexian), and selling her for profit. The afternoon before last, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the hearing in Criminal Division Two. Neither of the defendants appeared. Chinese detective Jin Wanrong reported that yesterday he took a summons to Tongfu Foreign Goods Company in Donghua Lane, Simalu, to summon Zhu Jinde, but the company's employees stated that there was no such person. He also went to No. 10, Jingde Lane, Menghua Street, Ximen, to summon Zhang Zhuxi, but he had left Shanghai for Hangzhou several days ago. Therefore, neither of them could be summoned. Then, lawyer Mi, representing the plaintiff, presented the case. Judge Wu stated that since the defendants had not been summoned, the case could not proceed and was adjourned to a later date when the defendants could be summoned again. The indictment is excerpted below:</p>
<p>For the crimes of abduction, rape, and sale, with an attached civil suit. My daughter, Qiaogu, was adopted by Zhang Zhuxi as an adoptive daughter when she was 13 years old, with the understanding that she would be allowed to marry by her own choice when she grew up. However, Zhang, with the face of a human but the heart of a beast, secretly raped Qiaogu before she turned 16. Later, I visited Zhang's house, and Qiaogu tearfully recounted what had happened. I, concerned about my reputation, advised my daughter to endure it for the time being, hoping that Zhang would repent. Unexpectedly, Zhang deceived Qiaogu into being formally betrothed to Zhu Jinde, falsely claiming that Zhu's wife had passed away and that he was taking her as his second wife, deceiving my daughter into believing that she was Zhu's first wife. In fact, although Zhu's first wife had passed away, he still had a second wife. Zhang and Zhu were in cahoots, and Zhang received 600 silver dollars from my daughter's sale. After arriving at Zhu's house, Zhu also deceived her, making her believe that she had a marital relationship with him and submitting to his lewdness. Later, I learned that Zhu had a second wife in his Ningbo hometown, and only then did I realize that she had been deceived. However, what was done was done, and she could only lament in vain. If my daughter could live a peaceful life, I would definitely not want to make trouble. Unexpectedly, Zhu pretended to be engaged in business, but in reality, he was engaged in all kinds of evil, specializing in the sale of people to seek profit. For example, several years ago, someone named A Shang first claimed to marry her as his wife, but soon resold her, earning a price of more than a thousand silver dollars. After A Shang was sold, he married A Ying, and in less than half a year, he sold A Ying again, earning a great deal of money. My mother is already the fifth person. My daughter married into Zhu's family in March of last year. At first, she was treated well, but as time went on, she became disliked, and he gradually began to mistreat her using his old tricks. In early October of last year, Zhu openly told Qiaogu that he wanted to marry another woman and would remarry her off. If she obeyed, she would have a good future; otherwise, her life would be in danger. After that, he led people to look at her. My daughter Qiaogu, although born of humble origins, still knew shame. How could a woman marry several times? Therefore, she cried constantly. Zhu, knowing that Qiaogu would not comply, took Qiaogu to Ningbo on December 2nd and confined her to a room to cover people's eyes and ears, waiting to agree on a price with the recipient before sending Qiaogu out. Fortunately, heaven did not abandon her. Qiaogu took the opportunity to escape to Shanghai and then returned to her hometown, telling the whole story. I have only this one daughter, and it is truly unbearable that she has been poisoned by such people. Zhang and Zhu have committed crimes under Articles 257, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, and Zhu has also committed crimes under Article 244 of the Criminal Law. I request that they be punished according to the law. Furthermore, my daughter has lost her virginity to these evildoers, and it will be difficult for her to remarry. If she remains single, she must have adequate support. This responsibility should be borne by the defendants. It is currently estimated at 300 yuan per year, for a period of 30 years. I also request that the defendants be jointly liable for 9,000 yuan in maintenance fees to appease the good and weak and deter the wicked and violent.</p>
<h3>Haihua Silk Factory Workers Assault Trade Union Director Shao Hongqin</h3>
<p>The Trade Union Reports to Party and Government Agencies and Requests Strict Punishment</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the case of the Haihua Silk Weaving Factory in Yangshupu suspending the night shift and laying off workers was mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. Due to the request of the management for an extension, the matter has been delayed. A few days ago, Shao Hongqin and Xi Zaimin, directors of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Trade Union, directly negotiated with Manager Li Ziwan and decided that the day shift workers would be responsible for providing a small amount of travel expenses. Yesterday, the factory decided to move the factory to Shengze and dismiss all the day shift workers as well, giving each person 30 silver dollars for travel expenses. All the workers agreed to receive the money. At 7 p.m. yesterday, the Trade Union again sent Director Shao Hongqin and others to the factory to negotiate with the management and day shift workers about providing travel expenses to the night shift workers. Who knew that the day shift workers would tightly close the iron gate, seriously injuring Trade Union Director Shao Hongqin and others? Yangshupu police rushed to the scene upon receiving the report and rescued Shao Hongqin and others, sending them to the hospital. It is heard that the Trade Union has reported the matter to Party and government agencies, requesting strict punishment of the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>A New Ghost Under the Shanghai-Hangzhou Train</h3>
<p>At 7:50 a.m. yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train No. 36 was traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou. When it reached the Yangqi area outside of the Xiashi station, a villager of about 30 years of age was walking on the tracks. The driver of the train entered the station and sounded the horn as a warning. However, the villager, seeing the train, became anxious to avoid danger. Due to the icy and slippery tracks, he was unable to avoid it in time and was crushed to death by the locomotive. The stationmaster sent police to take care of the situation, notified the local bailiff to conduct an autopsy, and prepared a coffin for burial. A report has been submitted to the Transportation Department for investigation.</p>
<h3>Gang Fight Between Two Groups of Workers: Zhang Xiaogen Partially Convicted</h3>
<p>On August 2nd of last year, a large-scale gang fight broke out between the Shandong gang and the Jiangyin gang in Xuejiabang, Nanshi, causing Chen Yingquan, the owner of a nearby noodle shop, to be hacked in more than 20 places. After more than five months of treatment, he finally recovered. Therefore, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution against Zhang Xiaogen, Wang Guirong, Tao Heshang, Wu Boqing, and others from Jiangyin, based on Article 295 of the Criminal Law. After repeated hearings, because Zhang Xiaogen and Wang Guirong were prosecuted in two separate cases, the judgment was first made on Zhang Xiaogen's part yesterday, sentencing him to ten months of imprisonment as a warning. The remaining three, Wang Guirong and others, will be sentenced separately. Zhang Xiaogen, upon hearing the judgment, declared that he accepted it willingly.</p>

<h3>Evil Husband</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Ms. Bing丨</p>
<p>I am a woman abused by her husband, and I feel no joy in life. I am currently contemplating suicide, but I have three sons, the eldest being five years old and the youngest just one year old. I fear that after I die, they too will perish with me, truly a dilemma in every direction. Recently, my nerves have been frayed, and the thought of suicide lingers in my mind all day long. I hope you, sir, can guide me towards a path of light; I would be immensely grateful, as would my children! Now, I will briefly describe my life below:</p>
<p>I am twenty-nine years old this year and have been married for eight years. We first met through a matchmaker's introduction, then corresponded, and finally arranged a face-to-face meeting. He said he was very pleased, only seeking my opinion. At that time, I saw</p>
<p>he was a university graduate and very honest. I was from an old-fashioned family and only knew to follow the crowd, so I agreed and we got engaged, and then married.</p>
<p>Before the marriage, he had already left his teaching position and was unemployed at home. Half a year after the marriage, his true colors emerged. He would scold at every turn and hit me at the slightest provocation. I had never seen such an evil person before, nor had I ever suffered such pain! At that time, I also had to consider my reputation and dared not speak to others about it. I suffered in silence, only crying in secret! But I did not resist, and he became more and more aggressive. A few days after the birth of our eldest child, I was beaten severely again because I had not gone to the kitchen. Each time I was beaten, it was always over trivial matters, such as a maid not listening to instructions or a child crying. He often drank alcohol and indulged his temper, beating me black and blue. Later, I couldn't bear it anymore and sometimes resisted. Then he became addicted to opium, and his temper became a little calmer, so I suffered less pain.</p>
<p>He is very stingy towards his wife. It is difficult to get him to make me a piece of clothing or buy me a pair of shoes. Since our marriage, I have never seen him voluntarily buy me anything, and I can't even get pocket money.</p>
<p>Since our marriage, he has been unemployed and has only hired a nanny for half a year. He refuses to hire a temporary nanny even for each childbirth. My father wrote a letter telling me that no matter what, I must hire someone for a month after childbirth to take care of my health, and he sent me money. But when I told him I would pay for it to hire a nanny, he refused. If he really had no money, I would be willing to share his hardships and have no complaints even if I worked myself to death, but he is not without money. How else could he afford to consume so much opium every day? He only cares about his own pleasure, where is his conscience? Now, in a family of six, I and the maid are busy all day long, often carrying the youngest child on my back while working. If the child cries, I get scolded again. He seems to think that scolding is his only skill. Whenever I have a moment, I have to teach the children to read and do needlework. I have to get up four or five times a night to care for the two youngest children. I have no rest during the day and also have to endure his anger. Recently, my body has become weak, and my spirit is withering; it is truly unbearable!</p>
<p>He quit his opium addiction this year, but in the past two months, he has been infatuated with prostitutes and sees me as a thorn in his side. At first, he would spend one night out per week, but recently he doesn't come home for two or three nights. Now, he goes out every day, and I suspect he is getting addicted to opium again. If I try to advise him, he finds my words grating and shouts loudly. If this continues, it seems he won't realize his mistakes until our family is torn apart!</p>
<p>I suggested saving money to prepare for their future school fees, but he said, "We'll talk about that when the time comes. If we don't have money, they won't go to school." I also said, "You are almost forty years old, yet you don't try to find a job." He said, "When you get old, you should enjoy yourself while you can." Such a person is hard to advise! Moreover, his temper is very bad, as I have already mentioned. If I say too much, he gets angry. When he gets angry, even the children don't dare to approach him; let him be alone. In the eight years I have been in his family, I have never seen any of his friends visit, and he doesn't even interact with his parents, siblings, or relatives. He goes to brothels, pleasure houses, the Great World entertainment complex, and movie theaters; he has no other respectable places to spend his time. (I see that he has no relatives or friends, so it is even harder for him to find a job. He is idle all day long, and I know he is also very frustrated. But his character is different from others; if things don't go his way, he scolds people for meddling. I secretly run around trying to find someone to help. Last year, my relatives found him two good job opportunities, and people came to invite him personally, but he refused to go; it's hard to describe in words.) He is now obsessed with prostitution and opium, and he has no desire to read books, let alone work. I see that he doesn't engage in honest work and is often depressed. If this continues, there will be a day when he runs out of money. He is a person without any emotion. When I am sick, he doesn't even come into the room to see me, nor does he ask how I am. Instead, he goes out and doesn't come home. But no matter how badly he treats me, I still love him. I have always treated him with sincerity and have never resisted him in anything. If he cannot forgive me, there is nothing I can do.</p>
<p>I cannot get a divorce. Because I once suggested a divorce, and my father became ill for several days upon hearing this, shedding tears for me. I think of my elderly father and love my sons, so I can only endure his abuse until death to fulfill my heart.</p>
<p>But recently, his abuse has become even worse. He doesn't give me a pleasant look when he comes home. Not to mention clothing and expenses, he doesn't even leave a single cent for groceries, and he doesn't care about the children's snacks. How can I tolerate this? He feels great pain over a household expense of dozens of yuan a month, but he spends dozens of yuan in one or two nights outside without any stinginess. Isn't this being cruel?</p>
<p>For the sake of my children's future happiness, I want to take legal action and separate from him, and have the stock interest and children under my management. I don't know if this is possible? If I manage it, I can accumulate two or three hundred yuan a year, which will alleviate the children's tuition fees in the future. Otherwise, suffering from his cruelty, there is really no joy in life. How can I live comfortably? I hope you can advise me.</p>
<p>Reply: Madam's letter, I read it with great emotion. Before replying, I want to ask Madam to stand at the forefront of the new era and listen to me without any dependence. Only then will it be beneficial. Otherwise, even if the reporter uses all his wisdom and effort to advise Madam, it will be in vain: ㈠ Madam should make a firm decision to sever ties with that good-for-nothing opium-addicted husband and divorce him decisively. ㈡ For the sake of the children's education, you can naturally meet him in court to request management of his property or an equal share of the stock, if necessary; ㈢ Madam's father's words must not be heeded: his mind is full of Confucius's "Three Obediences and Four Virtues" of the old ethics. He sacrificed his whole life and there is no way to change that, but are you willing to go to hell with him? If so, Madam, I must offend you by saying that your future is not worth our sympathy. ㈣ As for suicide, that is not a thought that we, as upward-striving human beings, should have. We should not commit suicide, but we must have the determination to commit suicide to fight against this social mentality that leads to suicide and the various relationships, ethics, and other social systems that force people to commit suicide. Remember, Mrs. Dewey said a very good sentence when she was in China: "I will not commit suicide; if I were to commit suicide, I would have to kill a few people first (the general idea)"; but I want to add a sentence: I will never commit suicide, and I will fight to the death with this society that forces people to commit suicide. The future will be bright, suicide is the shameful mentality of a coward, I hope Madam will no longer have this thought!</p>
<p>A batch of undeliverable letters</p>
<p>㈠ To Mr. Guo Feiju: Please provide detailed explanations of the principles of construction. If there is a real possibility of success, this newspaper will promote it on your behalf. ㈡ To Mr. Shi Qing: The statements in your letter are still a kind of superficial observation. The disease of China today lies in the dual oppression of international capitalism and the remaining local feudal forces. The way to cure it must be fundamentally reformed. What is stated in your letter is all trivial. ㈢ To Mr. Zhao Yunshan: The local supplement is limited to sales in this area, so it is not delivered to other areas. (If you have the opportunity to read the local supplement, you will know that there is no need to deliver it to other areas.) This is not only the case with this newspaper, but also other supplements attached to the local supplement are naturally subject to this restriction. This newspaper is sincerely grateful for the request in your letter, but in fact, it is difficult to comply. Please forgive us! ㈣ To [Blank]: We cannot agree with the means you have taken. You now only have to hurry home, confess your sins to your brother, and ask for his forgiveness. At the same time, gradually seek employment. Your eye disease should naturally be treated. We absolutely oppose "suicide" and "retreating into Buddhism." Please refer to today's reply to Ms. Bing for the reasons. ㈤ To Mr. Chen Zhengmu: Only by entrusting relatives and friends to explain to your father again, please allow you to finish your one and a half years of study, and then help him do business. Otherwise, you can only temporarily drop out of school. If you really don't have the economic strength to go to university after finishing middle school, you don't have to go to university. After a few years of suspension, you can continue your studies if you have the opportunity in the future. ㈥ To Mr. Guang Meiren: Your union with the other party did not go through legal procedures. Therefore, legally speaking, you are not responsible if you now abandon the other party and marry someone else. But morally speaking, since you voluntarily united with the other party, arbitrarily abandoning them now and disregarding their interests is not appropriate. Therefore, if you now decide to separate from the other party, if the other party fully agrees, there will be no problem. Otherwise, you must provide appropriate compensation for the suffering the other party will endure as a result, and always take "mutual benefit" as the premise.</p>

<h3>Beiping Citizens Angry at University Students for Suspending Classes</h3>
<p>Petitioning the Central Government to Halt Education Funding</p>
<p>To Be Reallocated as Military Expenses for Frontline Soldiers</p>
<p>(Beiping, 15th) Yang Jianzhai, Liang Guilin, and 365 other citizens of Beiping, recently due to the urgency of the national crisis and the fall of Yuguan, noted that university students are all retreating in fear, and the school authorities are unable to stop them.

<h3>Shandong to Conduct Third Qualification Examination for Primary School Teachers</h3>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The most important matter discussed at the recent conference of education bureau chiefs in Shandong Province was the universalization of compulsory education. The quality of primary school teachers is crucial to the future of compulsory education. Although primary school teachers throughout the province have already undergone two qualification examinations, there are still those who have not been examined. Therefore, it has been decided to hold a third examination this year. The registration dates have been set and communicated to the education bureaus of all counties and cities to be relayed to those who have not been examined. It is reported that there are approximately 40,000 primary school teachers in the province, and only half have been examined in the previous two examinations. In this third examination, the province will be divided into thirty-six districts, with the Provincial Education Department assigning a chief commissioner to each district. The commissioners of the municipalities where the districts are located will appoint examination commissioners, and the education bureau chiefs of those locations will appoint examiners. Those who score an average of 60 points or more will pass. Special circumstances may be considered flexibly. The examination is divided into three categories: ㈠ Exemption from examination based on review; ㈡ Exemption from part of the examination based on review; ㈢ Examination and review. The category depends on the qualifications of each teacher. Those who do not meet the qualifications will not be allowed to take the examination. The Educational Announcement is as follows: Registration and application will begin on January 1, 1933, and end on March 5. The locations of the examination districts and the dates of the examinations will be announced separately. In addition to instructing the county and city education bureaus and all provincial schools to comply, a public notice is hereby issued. All those who have the qualifications to take the examination, but are not currently serving in schools, and all current principals and teachers who have not been examined or failed the previous examination, must promptly consult the examination offices of the primary schools in their localities and follow the registration procedures within the prescribed time. Do not wait and delay yourselves. This is extremely important. This announcement is made by He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department of the Shandong Provincial Government.</p>

<p>(五) Appreciating music is also an important objective of this course. Therefore, each school must equip itself with a phonograph and records of famous Chinese and foreign musical pieces from ancient and modern times, the more complete the better.</p>
<p>(六) When lecturing on "overview of musical development" and "commentary on famous musical pieces," it is advisable to use the phonograph at any time and give students more opportunities to appreciate music.</p>
<p>(七) In each class, lecture on theory for about 20 minutes first, followed by vocal music instruction.</p>
<p>(八) If any students have systematically learned a certain instrument since primary school or junior high school, the teacher should find ways to allow them to continue learning and provide practical guidance so as not to bury their talent.</p>
<p>(九) When singing in chorus, attention should be paid to each person's vocal range, and appropriate division of parts must be observed.</p>
<p>(Editor's note) The curriculum standards for senior high schools that have been announced by the Ministry of Education will be published in succession in this newspaper. When subsequent announcements are made, we will disclose them as soon as possible to serve our readers.</p>

<p>Discussing Plans to Establish People's Schools, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau held its fifth social education organization meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday in the conference hall of the bureau. Attendees included Jin Zuobin, Zhang Jingye, Zhang Fengshan, Yao Huizi, and Yang Huiming. Yang Huiming chaired the meeting. After the opening formalities, the following items were reported: ㈠ Implementation status of the resolutions of the tenth meeting, ㈡ Important official documents, ㈢ Reports from various organizations.

<h3>Implementation Measures for the New Curriculum Standards for Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau of this city recently received an order from the Ministry of Education stipulating the implementation measures for the newly promulgated curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. It specifically instructed all municipal primary schools to comply. The order from the Ministry of Education stated: "Upon examination, the curriculum for kindergartens, primary schools, and the physical education curriculum for junior and senior high schools have been approved. The Ministry has already announced them and ordered the education departments of all provinces and cities to instruct the primary and secondary schools under their jurisdiction to comply. However, the current curriculum for each grade in primary and secondary schools is being implemented in accordance with the previously promulgated provisional curriculum standards. Changing the curriculum in the middle of the school year will inevitably lead to repetition or inconsistencies in continuity. Moreover, teaching materials and textbooks edited in accordance with the new standards have not yet been published. There will also be difficulties in the implementation of the new standards. Therefore, the implementation measures for the newly promulgated curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools are hereby specified as follows: 1. In the 1933 academic year, all grades in kindergartens and primary schools should strictly implement the newly promulgated curriculum standards for kindergartens and primary schools from the first semester. 2. In the 1933 academic year, the first grade of junior and senior high schools should strictly implement the newly promulgated middle school curriculum standards from the first semester. 3. In the 1933 academic year, if the curriculum outlines of the new and old curriculum standards differ greatly in the second and third grades of junior and senior high schools, the old standards may still be adopted until graduation to avoid repetition or inconsistencies in continuity. 4. When primary and secondary schools implement the newly promulgated standards, they should immediately adopt textbooks edited in accordance with the newly promulgated standards and approved by the Ministry. In addition to separate orders, the Bureau is hereby ordered to take note." Upon examination, the Municipal Education Bureau previously decided that the curriculum standards for kindergartens and primary schools would be implemented starting from the next semester. In view of the above, the instructions of the Ministry of Education should be complied with. All schools are hereby ordered to comply with this order.</p>

<h3>News of the Student Movement to Restore the Business and Medical Colleges</h3>
<p>The students of the Business and Medical Colleges once issued a declaration to restore the colleges and petitioned the government to withdraw the order for independence. Their past actions were orderly student movements in recent years, so they have been deeply supported and assisted by people from all walks of life and the education community. During the Third Plenary Session, the students sent a large number of representatives to petition, and the Presidium also approved the petition for its legal reasons and normal procedures. The Executive Yuan transferred it to the Ministry of Education for proper discussion and handling. However, because the minister had not been appointed for a long time, there was no concrete solution. Now, the students are taking advantage of the winter vacation to organize a resident petition delegation composed of students returning to Beijing. Together with the alumni association of the graduated students of the National Central University, they made a sincere request to the Ministry of Education, urging them to cancel the order for independence and restore the old view of the National Central University.</p>

<h3>Special Feature: Hygiene Teaching Methods for Primary and Secondary Schools - Lecture by Xu Su'en, Recorded by Hua Ji</h3>
<p>The year 1932 (Republic of China Year 21) has been designated by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau as the year for the Healthy Education Center Plan. The detailed implementation methods of the plan may not be necessary to discuss, but we know that giving public lectures to disseminate knowledge of healthy education to all primary and secondary school teachers and staff is one of the implementation methods stipulated in this Center Plan. On December 27th, 1932, the Municipal Education Bureau invited Xu Su'en, Director of the Hygiene Department of the Central University, and _ _ Physician, to Shanghai to lecture on this topic. More than 500 people attended the lecture. The material of the lecture was considered quite important, so I recorded it and provide it for reference by comrades who did not attend (Attached Note).</p>
<p>The nation is in serious condition like this, so how can we not pay attention to the education of the next generation of citizens? It's true that education should be valued, but hygiene education within general education also seems worthy of urgent attention. The standard curricula for primary and secondary schools have now been promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Hygiene is a new subject in the curriculum. If detailed explanations are not provided, it is inevitable that everyone will go their own way, or there will be many "trial and error" attempts, which are not economical in terms of time and spirit. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recognized this point and invited me to talk about it. I am willing to offer my humble opinion, as follows:</p>
<h3>Now is a Transition Period</h3>
<p>Hygiene is a new curriculum, with no foundation in the past and no reference for the future, making it difficult to get started. The current period can be called the transition period. We can only organize it based on the local situation and the data from the training class for school hygiene personnel held by Shanghai this time, as the basis for teaching.</p>
<h3>Which Grade to Start Teaching</h3>
<p>For primary school hygiene education, in which grade should we start? Some advocate the upper grades, and some advocate the lower grades. Opinions differ, and no consensus has been reached. I agree with starting from the first grade of primary school, mainly for the convenience of implementation. The younger the age, the easier it is to form good habits. Being able to implement hygiene education in infancy is what we strive for day and night. The teaching method should be based on past experiences. (Note from the reporter: This is the apperception principle in teaching methods, building new experiences on old experiences.)</p>
<h3>Children Take Responsibility Themselves</h3>
<p>In the transition period, there is very little old experience that can be used. Then young children themselves must take more responsibility for hygiene education. Most middle school students can take responsibility themselves. We expect them to solve 60% of the problems themselves. First graders in primary school cannot take much responsibility themselves, which will inevitably cause the teachers to work hard. Students in the fifth and sixth grades can almost take care of themselves, as long as the teacher guides them from the side.</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Theory and Behavior</h3>
<p>Unlike other things, hygiene education places equal emphasis on theory and behavior. If you only know some principles but cannot generate behavior, then why bother studying in the first place? However, as the age and _ _ are lower, the distinction between theory and behavior cannot be generalized. Upper graders in primary school may as well learn more theory, while lower graders, whose intelligence has not yet been developed, should learn more good behavior.</p>
<p>The so-called behavior, of course, also includes habits. Middle school students have sufficient knowledge and strong discrimination ability. The content of the teaching materials can be learned as a whole. If the teaching method is appropriate, many theories will naturally be behavioralized. This level is easier to achieve results than in primary school.</p>
<h3>Let's Talk About Primary Schools First</h3>
<p>Primary school is the foundation of middle school. Primary school hygiene teaching _ _ is the foundation of middle school hygiene teaching methods. All middle school teachers should _ _ a little knowledge of primary school hygiene teaching methods. Middle school teachers present, please study it patiently.</p>
<p>The only principle in primary school is that "doing" is more important than "knowing." Ordinary intelligence and action are as important as the two wings of a bird or the front wheels of a car. But when it comes to hygiene, action | habits, is much more important. We teach children to defecate once a day, and we teach children to exercise outdoors every day, but we don't necessarily have to teach them why. As long as they do it, the purpose has been achieved. It is okay to tell them the reason later.</p>
<h3>The First Step is to Investigate</h3>
<p>For convenience, I will divide it into several steps. The first step is to conduct a detailed investigation of students and their parents at the beginning of the school year or the health education plan. Below are five forms: (1) Child Health Record Form, which the teacher is responsible for filling out. Age _ _ is accurately calculated. Weight _ _ should be taken without clothes and shoes. The rate of weight increase _ _ should be set at a standard time, once a year or _ times a year, and the color and wetness of the skin should be filled in clearly. (2) Teacher Checklist for Children's Hygiene Habits. The item on whether there is an opportunity or not is very important. Having _ _ but not practicing becomes a _ _ problem. Not having the opportunity and not practicing is another problem. (3) Child Self-Assessment Checklist for Hygiene Habits. This varies depending on the age. It is compiled by the teacher. The table below can be used in higher grades. (4) Parent Assessment Checklist for Children's Hygiene Habits. This _ _ is the connection between the school and the family. Parents of students in Shanghai are much more enlightened than those in the interior, so it seems easy to carry out. (5) Hygiene Knowledge and Attitude Test Form. At the end of the school year or when the implementation of the health education plan comes to an end, ask each child to answer the questions on the form to see what they have learned.</p>
<p>Interesting Anecdotes from Scientific Research</p>
<p>Bovine Kidney Stone and Human Kidney Stone</p>
<p>Famous painter Ma Qizhou published on the existence of stones in bovine kidneys</p>
<p>The Research Department of Fo Ci Pharmaceutical Factory details human kidney stones</p>

Depending on the changes in chemical composition, there are different types of kidney stones, such as uric acid kidney stones, _ _ salt kidney stones, and ash acid _ kidney stones. Uric acid kidney stones are the most common type of kidney stones. Their stone quality is hard, with a smooth surface, or granular. Their color is _ red and dark black. Phosphate stones are caused by _ _ of phosphoric acid. This type of stone is easy to break and has a _ _ color on its surface. Picture of Tang Yulin, General of Rehe, in Current Affairs Pictorial.</p>
<p>In addition, there are four or five other types of stones with various chemical composition changes, but this belongs to specialized theory, so it is omitted here.</p>
<h3>2. Causes and Treatment of Kidney Stones</h3>
<p>The size and number of human kidney stones vary from person to person, and there is no fixed standard. However, kidney stones, depending on how they occupy space, can be large _ _, or shaped like antlers, occupying the entire kidney and affecting _. For this reason, kidney stones can cause diseases such as pyelonephritis and kidney stone pain, endangering life. The cause of kidney stones is mostly due to excessive consumption of alcohol and meat. There are also quite a few people who suffer from kidney stones due to gout or hereditary factors. As for the treatment methods, although there are physical therapy, drug therapy, and surgical removal of kidney stones, Shenqi Wan is the best.</p>

It snowed lightly at the beginning of the match at 3:00 p.m. The athletes on both sides showed great courage. However, it was difficult to lift and fall, so there was a lament of "I can't go, brother." In the first half, Shanghai Bank was more aggressive, but the Soochow warriors were unyielding and persistent in their pressure. However, neither side scored. In the second half, Shanghai Bank seemed even more energetic, passing the ball three or five times and scoring a goal from the left wing. Soochow made efforts to counterattack, but the Shanghai Bank's three armies fought to defend, and although there were many dangerous situations, they were able to turn the danger into safety with good defense.

<h3>Manure-Making Machine</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Are humans truly the "Spirit of all things"? I have some doubts. Why is it that ants, though [missing text], are still courageous and fierce in battle, like brave warriors? Spiders are also [missing text] creatures, yet without studying architecture or geometry, they can spin webs [missing text]. Why do police dogs and warhorses never "defect" or "flee in battle"? It seems humans are hardly worthy of being called the "Spirit of all things"!</p>
<p>No matter what insects, fish, birds, or beasts, they all know how to "eat," "urinate," and "reproduce." Humans' instincts are no more than these few things. However, humans are incredibly busy with these few things. What wars arise from the words "food" and "sex"? Thinking carefully about it, isn't it all just laughable?</p>
<p>There are so many ways to be human: to be as honored as a national leader, governing all nations, called a head of state; to be a world-class talent, with power surpassing others, called a great hero; to be wealthy with copper mountains, possessing millions of assets, called a rich man; to have no means of livelihood, with a room like an empty hall, called a poor scholar; to have astonishing talent and unparalleled beauty, called a gifted scholar; to have perfect bearing and devastating beauty, called a beautiful woman. But upon careful thought, upon careful thought, whether saint, worthy, traitor, robber, rich man, poor scholar, gifted scholar, beautiful woman... all are merely [missing text], eating and defecating, with no special characteristics. When alive, they are all "manure-making machines." When dead, who doesn't become a "dirt [missing text]"? Tell me, where have Qin Emperor, Han Emperor Wu, Napoleon, Shao Tong, Shi Chong, Xi Shi, Wang Zhaojun, Sima Xiangru, and Pan An all gone now?</p>
<p>Given this premise, using logic and deduction, we can arrive at a conclusion: that "man is a manure-making machine." What saints, heroes, traitors, robbers, rich men, poor scholars, gifted scholars, beautiful women... aren't these all just arbitrary distinctions made by people? What delicacies aren't the elements of fertilizer? Because people don't understand that they are "manure-making machines," they arbitrarily distinguish many appearances and establish many names, and thus human hearts have emotions such as "love," "hate," "pride," "flattery," "sorrow," "joy," "resentment," and "anger"... and the world is full of troubles from then on. Alas!</p>
<h3>Kaleidoscope High</h3>
<p>— Qi Wo</p>
<p>Chinese society seems like a kaleidoscope. In the cities, capitalism is advancing madly, with machinery, automobiles, jazz music, and almost everything that a capitalist society should have. However, in the countryside and other remote areas, farmers are still farming with 18th-century production methods, and there are still feudal-style local areas, medieval-style "market days," and wheelbarrows as the only means of transportation.</p>
<p>No other country has such uneven development as China. The culture of Gansu is said to be four hundred years behind that of Jiangsu. This situation is like a person's limbs being of unequal size, which is simply a malformed development. Nan Sheng's book "The Riddle of China" has finally revealed the hidden places of Chinese society.</p>
<p>To solve this "Riddle of China," I don't think it is difficult. The only key is to develop transportation. However, China's transportation industry is crawling along and is often harmed by individuals. The Wu-Guang Railway in Anhui could not proceed because the organizer embezzled the funds and fled. Recently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company secretly signed a loan contract with foreigners, and even the Deputy Minister of Communications was involved. How can this enable China's transportation to develop and China's culture to be evenly unified, breaking this kaleidoscope society?</p>

<h3>Guilty Conscience</h3>
<p>— Liao Hongshou Juan</p>
<p>Xiao Man hurriedly snatched the words, saying, "No, no, he is not a polar bear, he is a small otter!" When she said the words "small otter," she deliberately raised her soft and charming voice higher. When Dongfang Sheng heard his wife say this, he immediately remembered his drenched state when he stumbled into the door, and couldn't help clapping his hands and laughing.</p>
<p>A joyful atmosphere covered up the sound of wind and snow outside the room. He naturally understood Liang You's painstaking efforts, and a trace of a bitter smile appeared on his gloomy and sluggish face.</p>
<p>That night, the couple sacrificed their sweet sleep to accompany him until two or three o'clock in the morning before sending him into a complete and comfortable bedroom, personally watching him sleep well. When they said good night to each other, they kindly instructed him: "You might as well sleep a little longer tomorrow, and don't think too much about things."</p>

However, this kind of bitter smile was only like a spark on his face, and it vanished in the blink of an eye. After he smiled for a moment, his heart was completely immersed in an unconscious state. He was completely unaware of everything around him. The tender willow branches did not offend him, but he only cared about grabbing them in his hand and finely trampling them.</p>

In particular, Xiao Man treated him very kindly, even to the point of providing him with socks and shoes before he even asked, taking care of everything that needed to be done or bought, and providing him with what he needed in a timely manner. They never made him feel any hardship as a guest in spirit or in substance. It turned out that they really treated him as one of their own. (7)</p>
<h3>Ties and Buttons</h3>
<p>— Yue Shan</p>
<p>When an old lady finds a piece of broken old newspaper in the outhouse, she will blurt out "Sin!" When an old [missing text] sees white rice scattered on the floor in the dining room, he also shouts "Sin!" without thinking. In these two "sins," there is "another kind of feeling in the heart!"</p>
<p>(Two Absurd Legends)</p>
<p>If you are happy to do so, please come and listen to me tell two legends. Although they are very absurd, they can always relieve boredom, and their purpose is not to do any research.</p>
<p>Now, most modern men like to wear Western suits. People who wear Western suits must go to a Western suit shop to make a set of suits and vests, and they must also go to a department store to buy a tie. If a person does not have a tie, no matter how beautiful his Western suit is, he will not dare to wear it on the street (except for those who wear turn-down collar shirts in the summer). Even the eccentric Japanese devils can wear Western suits without hats, but they must use a two-finger-wide belt-like tie no matter what. I also like to wear Western suits. I often feel that ties are unnecessary: they are too hot in the summer, and if they are tied a little too tightly in the winter, even breathing becomes uncomfortable. Since this is the case, why must Westerners use it? I have asked many Western suit friends about this, but they cannot give a very satisfactory answer. One of them said this (he also heard it from others):</p>
<p>Around the fourth century AD in Europe, there was a great migration of Germanic peoples, the reason for which was that Dou Xian of the Han Dynasty defeated the Northern Xiongnu. The Northern Xiongnu then invaded Europe, and the Germanic people were forced by the Xiongnu to cause a great migration. At that time, the yellow-skinned Xiongnu people won the battle and tied the necks of the white-skinned Germanic people with the foot bindings taken from the Chinese women they captured, pulling them along. This was to insult the Germanic people. Later, they were released, and in order to commemorate that humiliation, they added a belt around their necks, and this custom became popular throughout Europe and became today's fashionable tie.</p>
<p>Another absurd legend is about the buttons used on the sleeves of Western suits. It is said that in the past, the guards of a certain European king had a very bad habit of often using their sleeves to wipe their noses. It was a small matter to soil their clothes, but it was a very impolite act when the king summoned ministers or met with other kings. The king repeatedly warned them without effect, so he thought of a clever method and added a few buttons to their sleeves. If the guards used their sleeves to wipe their noses again, the buttons would scratch their noses and cause them pain. As a result, their bad habits gradually disappeared. Later, when the guards went out on the street, ordinary people saw the buttons on their sleeves and thought it was a beautiful new outfit. After that, everyone added a few buttons to their sleeves, but they all added them to the bottom of the sleeves, probably because they didn't see them clearly.</p>

<h3>Dove and Hunter</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>One day, a hunter took his gun and went hunting in the mountains. He ran around in the mountains all day, but got nothing. He felt very sad, and sat alone on a rock in the forest to rest. Suddenly, a pair of doves flew over. The doves knew the hunter very well. They flew to the front and said to the hunter:</p>
<p>Dove: "Old uncle, what unhappy thing happened to you today? I see that your face is showing a very depressed look. Can you tell me?"</p>
<p>Hunter: "To be honest with you, I went out early this morning and ran into the mountains. It's this time of day, and I still haven't gotten anything. My legs are sore from running, and my stomach is very hungry, so I'm extremely depressed."</p>
<p>Dove: "Old uncle, since that's the case, please come to my house to eat some snacks and fill your stomach." The hunter followed him to his home, and the dove gave the hunter his own food—insects, [missing text], etc. However, the hunter could not eat the dove's food. The kind dove saw that the hunter could not eat his own food and said: "Old uncle, please wait a moment, and there will be very delicious roasted meat for you to eat."</p>
<p>While he was talking, he carried a large pile of branches and placed them in front of the hunter, asking the hunter to light them on fire. When the fire was raging, he [missing text]</p>
<p>He immediately flew into the raging fire. The hunter saw him fly into the fire and tried to save him, but the dove was already burned to death. The hunter thought that the dove (did not spare his life to give to others, dying for me.) Shed tears, expressing regret.</p>
<h3>Soap Bubbles</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>Use washing soap, cut it into small pieces, put it in a bowl, add water and stir it, then add a little white sugar, and blow it with a tube, you will be able to blow them large and fly high and far. If no white sugar is mixed in, and only soapy water is used, it cannot be blown large and is easy to break. Because adding white sugar can increase the stickiness of the soapy water, even if it is blown very large, it is not easy to break.</p>
<h3>Clock and Watch Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Question: There are many kinds of clocks and watches. Which country makes the best ones in the world now?</p>
<p>Answer: "Of course, Switzerland is the best. Because the Swiss make timepieces like our people raise silkworms. The country people specialize in manufacturing coarse and fine screws, gears, springs, hairsprings, and other items in their spare time. Therefore, most farmers in the country can manufacture them. The more they manufacture, the more refined the products naturally become."</p>
<p>Question: "When we go to buy clocks and watches, what kind of style is the most suitable?"</p>
<p>Answer: "Among wristwatches, the three-size Swiss watch is the most suitable. There are also eight-size and nine-size watches. For wall clocks, the sixteen-size is the most suitable. As for the watch case, a steel case is the most durable. Now, those who are extravagant and modern mostly use gold cases, but the internal mechanism of a gold case watch may not be good."</p>
<p>Question: "What is the meaning of 'size'?"</p>
<p>Answer: "This is the diameter calculation of the movement. The length of one size is "</p>
<p>2.2555 millimeters, and nine size is nine times that."</p>
<p>Question: "What is the most important thing in the mechanism?"</p>
<p>Answer: "The most important thing in the mechanism is the jewel set in the axle of the gear. This jewel is installed to prevent friction on the axle. Ordinary cheap watches use garnet, while good watches use red gems or green gems, diamonds, and other valuable items. Watches using this kind of gem are generally of good quality. There is a type of watch with twenty-three jewels embedded, but a truly good watch is not limited to a watch with many jewels. Generally, a good and less easily damaged watch only has seven jewels embedded, while a cheap and easily damaged watch may have fifteen garnets embedded. In short, if a watch has seven jewels embedded, it must be good.</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Medicine in Shanghai in the Past Decade</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Business Conditions (Continued)</p>
<p>If it is a poor family, I am afraid that after a Chinese medicine doctor's diagnosis, a Western medicine doctor will look and leave; after new and old doctors have examined them, the old doctor will also end up saying "Please seek a better doctor." In the end, they still seek the Immortal Elder and eat incense ash. In addition, and of lower quality, there are exaggerated advertisements, clever perfunctory statements, tree window advertisements, strange shapes and forms, which are too numerous to mention. In a word, if academic ability is insufficient, they must force their way into a livelihood; or if they learn but do not apply it to the times, they will inevitably damage some integrity in order to make a living. Therefore, recently, members of the Physicians' Association have wanted to rectify these strange phenomena slightly, but it has been quite troublesome, and they can only start by banning aspects that are too harmful to society.</p>
<p>Calculating it this way, there are more than 3,000 doctors in Shanghai, old doctors, Western doctors, who rely on medicine for a living, which is really an average of one person for less than 1,000 people. Moreover, religious charlatans and itinerant quacks are not included. It can be said that the supply exceeds the demand, so how can it not be chaotic?</p>
<p>I have studied the reasons why there is a surplus of doctors in Shanghai: ㈠ Those who graduate from abroad and are bathed in European and American customs naturally find Shanghai more convenient in their life and technology, so they open their practices in Shanghai. ㈡ Shanghai has several public and private medical schools. The students among them regard Shanghai as their second hometown during their studies, and after graduation, they naturally like to open their practices in Shanghai. Moreover, they feel that the equipment they saw during their internships is not easy to arrange in the interior. ㈢ Shanghai is the economic center, and everyone wants to earn some money in Shanghai, which is also an important reason. ㈣ Shanghai has relatively more various hospitals, and the nurses in those hospitals presumptuously come out to hang up their shingles and practice medicine. They also feel that Shanghai is easier to handle. ㈤ Due to the unrest in the interior and the precarious political situation, the number of people who have moved to Shanghai to live in the past decade has increased to more than one million. As a result, they have brought several doctors who are well-known in the interior with them. ㈥ The most ridiculous thing is that among these more than one million people who have the strength to come to Shanghai, there are naturally many seeds of scholars. It just so happens that our noble country's old medicine teaches something like "Confucian principles of internal and external prescriptions," and every scholar can become a doctor without a teacher. When those people arrive in Shanghai, they are oppressed by the high cost of living and feel that it is not easy to be a temporary resident in Shanghai, so they try to use medicine as an occupation. They ask a few celebrities to publish an introduction in the newspaper, saying that they are descendants of generations of doctors from Liuzhou or famous elders from Shexian, how famous and how skilled they are. In addition, they add some self-made secret recipes and family-inherited ancient books, which is enough to sensationalize people. It just so happens that the temperament of the Shanghainese, according to a common saying among the people of the Jiangnan region, is called "Distant monks recite scriptures better." They often flock to them like ducks to water. You should know that three or five minor illnesses can be cured without medicine. When the disease is accidentally cured, the Confucian doctor will also "take advantage of the luck for ten years, and treat illnesses early." Once one of them succeeds, others will follow suit. As for whether this kind of doctor enjoys a great reputation in his hometown? Whose high-ranking disciple is he after all? Which master's disciple? It still needs to be investigated. Therefore, this kind of opening a practice has long lost the true spirit of old medicine, which values tradition. Fortune tellers in Shanghai often mark their advertisements with the phrase "No intention of an official career. Visiting friends as a fortune teller." Of course, there are also advertisements for famous doctors, saying "Not for a good minister. Reclusive doctor who benefits the world," a kind of talk. That's really medical divination and astrology complementing each other.</p>
<p>Now, how to digest the surplus of doctors in Shanghai and how to rectify the chaotic medical world is a very big social problem. Although there are several methods below in this article that can be used for reference, the main hub is still in politics. Although the theory of evolution calls it "survival of the fittest," allowing natural elimination, but the people's common sense is insufficient. I dare say that in the market now, the worse can be the better, and the better may not necessarily fail. Why? Because the worse the person, the thicker the skin, and the more skillful the deceptive tricks they use. Moreover, medical skills are not comparable to other goods. If you want to eliminate a mediocre doctor, how many lives must accompany him?</p>
<p>In addition, the relationship between the common people and the new doctors, as well as the relationship between the experts of the new doctors and the poor, will all be discussed within the scope of hospitals in the following article, and there will also be some small contributions.</p>
<p>In addition, the various excellent instruments used by the new doctors and the various instruments for physical therapy, such as sun lamps, X-rays, electric heaters, etc., are all too un-popular. I have published an opinion in the latest issue of Medical Review. Please refer to it. This article will not discuss it in detail.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about hospitals again. The nature of hospitals can be roughly divided into two categories: public hospitals and private hospitals. Public hospitals must have funds as a foundation or annual funding as an auxiliary. Only then can they fulfill their responsibilities and benefit the public. More than twenty years ago, there were very few hospitals in Shanghai that were run by Chinese people themselves to serve the public and that were well-known. They were none other than Renji Hospital, Tongren Hospital, Baolong Hospital, Xin Puyu Tang Hospital, Guangci Hospital, and Guangren Hospital. However, none of them were run by foreigners, or funded by foreign charitable organizations, or subsidized by foreign churches. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Concession manages several hospitals, which have a specialized isolation nature that is different from ordinary hospitals. When the Municipal Council has medical needs, it entrusts the above-mentioned hospitals to handle them on its behalf, calling them the Municipal Council-designated hospitals. As a result, those hospitals are filled with the colors of foreign economy. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Scientific Essays on Reaching Life (II)</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>㈢ Conception</p>
<p>After sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, the man's semen is injected into the woman's reproductive organs. Each time, the semen contains tens of millions of sperm, which run around each other. If a mature egg enters the fallopian tube, the last and most powerful sperm touches the egg yolk. A part of the egg yolk swells up into a mound. After the sperm head occupies the mound, the top of the mound collapses and takes in the sperm. This is called fertilization. The fertilized egg then adheres to the uterus and gradually develops. The nuclei of the cells of both the man and the woman combine into one, and then divide again, gradually forming the shape of a body. ㈣ Pregnancy Egg</p>
<p>After a mature egg is fertilized, it is called a pregnancy egg. It is divided into five parts: fetus, umbilical cord, placenta, amniotic membrane, and amniotic fluid.</p>
<p>(A) Mature fetus... The whole body is plump, full of hair, and the nails are hard. The hands and feet move, the eyes open, and it cries.</p>
<p>(B) Placenta... Commonly known as the afterbirth, it is long and round or round. The texture is like a sponge. It is attached to the uterine wall and absorbs the mother's blood through the umbilical cord and transports it to the baby's body. The blood circulating throughout the fetus's body passes through the umbilical cord to the mother's placenta. The side that is attached to the uterine wall has an uneven shape and many grooves and tubes. The fetus side is smooth, thick in the center, thin around, and dark red. The so-called green-clad placenta means that the fetus will definitely develop in the future. That is wrong. It is because the placenta has many vascular networks, so it has this color. The placenta of a noble and the placenta of a beggar are the same, with no difference.</p>
<p>(C) Umbilical cord... The fetus cannot breathe or eat in the womb. It relies entirely on the umbilical cord to regulate gases and absorb nutrients. Therefore, one end is connected to the placenta and the other end is connected to the baby's abdomen. It is a channel for transporting blood. One umbilical vein and two umbilical arteries. The umbilical vein sends fresh blood to the fetus, and the umbilical artery returns the blood from the fetus, that is, the used blood, back to the placenta, and then the placenta transports it back to the mother's body. (D) Amniotic membrane... It is the fetal membrane, with a total of three layers, closely adhering to each other, forming a sac shape, storing amniotic fluid. The inner layer is called the amnion, the middle layer is called the chorion, and the outer layer is called the decidua.</p>
<p>(E) Amniotic fluid (fetal water)... The fetus floats in it, which can expand the uterine cavity, making it easier for the fetus to move, and prevent the harm of sudden strikes. During childbirth, it expands the uterus, ( ), seeking the path for the fetus to come out, and makes it smooth.</p>
<h3>On Phlegm I</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunshan</p>
<p>The phlegm that people today refer to is not the phlegm that ancient people referred to. Jin Gui described the symptoms of phlegm drink, saying that the person was originally strong but is now thin, and water runs between the intestines, making a dripping sound, which is called phlegm drink. This is because water accumulates in the stomach and intestines and makes a sound, which is not the phlegm that people today refer to. If the phlegm that people today refer to is thick and turbid, how can it make a dripping sound? Then what did the ancients call the phlegm that people today refer to? They called it tingmo (saliva), or zhuoti (turbid nasal mucus). The Jin Gui says, "If water is in the lungs, one spits tingmo (saliva)." It also says, "If there is cold in the lungs, one spits zhuoti (turbid nasal mucus)." It also says, "If the cun kou pulse is rapid, and the person coughs and has turbid saliva and tingmo (saliva) in the mouth, what is the reason?" The teacher says, "It is because of pulmonary flaccidity." It also says, "If wind lodges in the lungs, the person coughs, has a dry mouth, is full of air, has a dry throat but is not thirsty, and spits a lot of turbid saliva." It also says, "If there is cough and upward qi, one spits turbid saliva from time to time, and can only sit and cannot sleep." It also says, "This is because there is cold in the lungs, and there is a lot of ting saliva (saliva)." It also says, "One spits turbid saliva from time to time, and there is a gall bladder odor." All of these are what people today call phlegm. People today often mention phlegm in relation to lung disease, and mention lung disease in relation to phlegm. However, the Jin Gui's chapters on pulmonary carbuncle, pulmonary flaccidity, cough and upward qi, and the chapter on cold and accumulation in the five viscera all mention lung disease without mentioning phlegm. People today often mention phlegm in relation to cough, and mention cough in relation to phlegm. However, the Jin Gui's chapters on pulmonary carbuncle, pulmonary flaccidity, cough and upward qi, all mention cough without mentioning phlegm. The chapters on phlegm drink and cough mention cough in relation to pending drink and supportive drink without mentioning phlegm, and mention phlegm in relation to phlegm drink without mentioning cough. Although the name of the chapter is "Phlegm Drink Cough," it seems that phlegm and cough are related</p>
<p>, but the Pulse Classic quotes the text of the Jin Gui's Four Drinks, and phlegm drink is written as bland drink. The Great Five Drinks Pill in the Thousand Gold Prescriptions Phlegm Drink Chapter is also written as bland drink. All of the words for phlegm drink in the Thousand Gold Wings are written as bland drink. From this, the word phlegm should originally be written as bland. Those who wrote it as phlegm, later added phlegm to indicate the meaning of the disease, which is a vulgar word. Zheng Xi's First Month Post has the words "bland suffocation and dry vomiting." The Mistakes in Calligraphy Posts takes bland to be the bland liquid of ancient times, and dry to be the dry and wet of ancient times, which also takes phlegm to be bland. The Meaning of All Sutra Sounds says, "Bland yin refers to the liquid above the chest," which also takes phlegm drink to be bland yin. Bland means bland in taste, which has nothing to do with disease. However, bland is interchangeable with dan, and the commentary on Pan Anren's Golden Valley Collection of Poems in the Selections of Literature says, "Dan is the same as bland." That is, phlegm drink can be written as bland drink, and can also be written as dan drink. The Explanation of Words says, "Dan, water shakes." The Book of Han's Records of Ritual and Music and Ban Biao's Biography Commentary say, "Dan means moving." Therefore, the disease of dan drink means that water in the stomach shakes and makes a sound, hence the name. Please verify it further. The Thousand Gold Great Five Drinks Pill, the fifth is called flowing drink, and water is between the intestines, shaking and making a sound. The statement that water is between the intestines, shaking and making a sound, coincides with the Jin Gui's phlegm drink, where water runs between the intestines and makes a dripping sound. This shows that the Jin Gui's phlegm drink is the flowing drink of the Thousand Gold Great Five Drinks Pill. It is clear. And phlegm, that is, the word dan, has the meaning of shaking, which is also clear. Then what about the words "bland drink, water in the stomach" in the Great Five Drinks Pill? It is said that bland drink and flowing drink have the same symptoms and are both named after the shaking sound. The Great Five Drinks Pill takes what is in the stomach to be bland drink, and what is in the intestines to be flowing drink. In short, whether in the stomach or in the intestines, bland drink and flowing drink can be combined into one, or divided into two. Moreover, the meridian classic quotes the text of the Jin Gui's Four Drinks, and phlegm drink is written as bland drink, and below it is noted, "One says retained drink." According to this, the word retained should probably be written as flowing, and the water radical has been mistakenly omitted. Why do I say this? The Jin Gui mentions that the symptoms of retained drink include pain in the hypochondrium pulling towards the rib cage, and mentions pending drink repeatedly in the Four Drinks. The Thousand Gold Prescriptions Great Five Drinks Pill, one is called retained drink, where stagnant water is under the heart. Retained means stagnant. If it is stagnant, then it cannot run between the intestines and make a dripping sound. Therefore, it is known that the word retained is a mistake. Because the water runs between the intestines and makes a dripping sound, it is known that it should be written as the word flowing. Flowing is the same as stream. The commentaries on the Qin Fu Shooting Pheasant Fu in the Selections of Literature all take flowing to mean water flowing, which can be verified. Flowing drink is the same as flowing drink. It is known that the ancient version of the Meridian Classic quotes the text of the Jin Gui's Four Drinks, and phlegm drink must have been written as flowing drink. It can also be known that the two words phlegm drink in the Jin Gui's ancient version must have been written as bland drink, which coincides with the flowing drink in the Thousand Gold Great Five Drinks Pill. As for the two words cough in the chapter title, it is because pending drink and supportive drink have the symptom of cough, and it is involved in it, not establishing a separate chapter for cough. Therefore, Danbo thinks that the two words cough can be removed. This saying is correct. From this, the four words phlegm drink cough in the chapter title are not related. The ancient version of the chapter title may not be like this. The Meridian Classic has the sections on smoothing pulmonary flaccidity, pulmonary carbuncle, cough, upward qi, and bland drink pulse symptoms. The Jin Gui's phlegm drink may also be combined with the chapters on pulmonary flaccidity, pulmonary carbuncle, cough, and upward qi, like the sections in the Meridian Classic. Later generations of shallow people did not know the meaning of phlegm drink, and took phlegm to be viscous saliva and turbid saliva, and established a separate chapter. They then extracted the two words cough from pending drink and supportive drink to combine them. Therefore, at first glance at the chapter title, it is the same as the people today who discuss phlegm and cough. This is a big mistake. Therefore, I say that if you want to discuss phlegm today, you should not cite the Jin Gui as a basis, but all those who have discussed phlegm in the past have all imitated the Jin Gui's phlegm drink in their discussions.</p>

<h3>China's Tuberculosis Problem (I)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>㈠ The relationship between early diagnosis and treatment of stomach disease... ㈡ Tuberculosis and medicine... ㈢ The implementation of surgery for tuberculosis... ㈣ Prevention of tuberculosis and sanatoriums</p>
<p>Tuberculosis in China has become the most common disease in society. According to disease statistics in various countries, the number of deaths from tuberculosis accounts for about one-seventh of all deaths, and the statistics of tuberculosis patients are at least more than ten times the total number of patients with various acute infectious diseases, which is truly the most terrifying disease.</p>
<p>The more civilized the world and the more advanced the culture, the wider the spread of tuberculosis. However, in European and American countries, public health has also improved with the times, so before the European War, tuberculosis statistics had gradually decreased. However, in our country, the mortality rate of tuberculosis is more than three times higher than in other countries. According to the death statistics report of the First Health District of Beiping in the 18th year of the Republic of China, 307 out of every 100,000 people died from tuberculosis. In the United Kingdom, it is 70 out of every 100,000 people, in Germany it is 93 people, and in Japan it is 132 people who die from tuberculosis. If we look at the statistics of our country's population, then one person in the whole country dies from tuberculosis every half minute. Therefore, tuberculosis in China has a truly great latent evil force. Its attack on our people is most common in adolescence. Men are most likely to contract tuberculosis from the age of 20 to 30, and women from the age of 15 to 25. Therefore, the direct sacrifice of the people and the intangible loss to the country are almost impossible to predict or statistically analyze. It is definitely not comparable to floods, beasts, or acute infectious diseases. Therefore, tuberculosis in China is the most serious problem in public health administration and the medical field.</p>
<p>The reason why the tuberculosis mortality rate in our country is high is due to the lack of public health facilities, the lack of tuberculosis sanatoriums, and the low level of national health knowledge. Because there is no corresponding research on this disease during normal times, and people do not know how to isolate and recuperate when they are sick, this is the biggest reason for the spread of this disease. Therefore, it is not easy to solve the tuberculosis problem in China at present. To achieve the goal of this difficult task, the power of the country is indispensable, the improvement of public health facilities is indispensable, and the enrichment of health knowledge of the people throughout the country is indispensable. In other words, it is definitely not something that can be accomplished overnight.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of doctors, if we want to solve the current tuberculosis problem, we should pay attention to the following points. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Leisurely Chats After Diagnosis (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Senyu</p>
<p>A few days ago, a gentleman came to my clinic requesting a diagnosis. He complained of poor health and sought methods to improve his constitution. After a thorough examination and assessment of his body, the result indicated mere malnutrition. However, in today's society, quite a few people suffer from weakness due to malnutrition. Therefore, I take this opportunity, using a corner of the Shenbao Medical Weekly, to discuss this topic briefly with the readers.</p>
<p>㈠ Nutritional methods do not consist solely of diet; various hygienic practices must also be followed in conjunction to achieve the desired outcome. Now, regarding hygiene, I will elaborate on it in detail:</p>
<p>A. Outdoor exercise: People often reside indoors without engaging in physical activity. They are unable to receive sunlight or obtain fresh air, naturally leading to a weakened constitution. Daily walks outdoors, in parks, or in the countryside allow for exposure to sunlight, the intake of fresh air, and bodily exercise. This facilitates smooth blood circulation throughout the body, enriching it with nutrients and thereby strengthening the constitution. B. Bathing: The skin covering our body is constantly renewing itself. Shed skin cells combine with excreted fluids and sebum, accumulating into dirt. Over time, this dirt decomposes, producing foul odors and damaging the skin, resulting in rashes. Bacteria easily thrive in this environment, producing toxins that penetrate the skin and reach the internal organs, continuously poisoning them. As a result, the constitution weakens, and one frequently suffers from illnesses. Bathing once daily, or every other day, is advisable. At the very least, one should bathe one or two times per week. By regularly removing dirt, the skin will not be harmed, and subcutaneous blood flow will be improved. With sufficient nourishment, the skin will become healthy, preventing diseases and strengthening the body.</p>
<p>C. Fresh air: Clean air is rich in gas and abundant in open spaces, such as parks, the countryside, and outdoor environments. This gas is essential for nourishing the human body. Therefore, human respiration must be continuous. One must step outdoors daily to inhale it abundantly and replenish it. Indoor air should be changed frequently by opening doors and windows to allow fresh air to enter, at least for ten minutes each time, twice a day, in the morning and evening. Prolonged exposure to unclean air leads to weakness due to malnutrition. Conversely, fresh air promotes a healthy and robust constitution.</p>
<p>D. Moderation in spirit and emotions: Excessive expenditure or overwhelming experience of our spirit and emotions can lead to fatigue, causing a decline in overall bodily function. Conversely, underutilization of spirit and emotions can also result in a loss of vitality, significantly impacting nutrition. Therefore, daily self-regulation is essential to achieve the goal of health and nutrition.</p>
<p>E. Control of temperament: While individual temperaments may vary, undesirable traits should be self-controlled to prevent harm to overall nutrition. Methods of self-cultivation can be employed to correct these traits.</p>
<p>F. Adequate sleep: Human life involves working during the day and resting at night, using sleep to restore mental and physical strength. Sufficient time is necessary. Laborers need approximately ten hours of rest daily, while those engaged in mental work require at least eight hours. Shortening sleep duration leads to depletion of physical strength, while excessive sleep results in a lack of exercise, also leading to malnutrition. Therefore, moderation is advisable.</p>
<p>㈡ Dietary Nutritional Methods: Our movements, whether minor or major, consume physical strength. Thus, daily consumption of food and drink is necessary to replenish it. Furthermore, to ensure continued survival, we must maintain an uninterrupted life force, fostering its daily generation and preserving a healthy constitution for longevity. Therefore, careful attention must be paid. While nature provides an abundance of food and drink, appropriate and genuinely beneficial options must be selected. Foods from the animal and plant kingdoms should be chosen, prioritizing those whose components align with the needs of the human body. Digestion within the body must also be considered, and preparation methods should aim to preserve the original quality of the food. The main components of food are protein, fat, and starch, along with various salts, water, and plant and animal cell fibers. Fresh, living plants and animals contain a vital element, essential for enhancing our life force. Now, I will present examples of various foods and drinks, categorized according to their main components, followed by suitable nutritional methods and items to avoid. Details on digestion and the functions of vitamins will be omitted.</p>
<p>子、Food and Drink</p>
<p>1. Rich in Protein</p>
<p>Animal sources: A. Meats: beef, veal, mutton, lamb, pork, horse, rabbit, goose, hen, duck, pigeon, etc.; veal tongue, heart, liver, kidney, and hen's milk.</p>
<p>B. Fish: carp, grass carp, crucian carp, etc. C. Eggs: chicken, duck, goose eggs, especially the egg white. D. Milk and dairy products: cow and goat milk, protein milk, cheese, yogurt, milk biscuits.</p>
<p>Plant sources: A. Grains and their products: coarse and fine wheat flour, rice flour, corn flour, oat flour and flakes, barley flour, mung bean flour, millet, pasta, noodles, white bread, milk bread, wheat dry bread.</p>
<p>B. Legumes: dried peas, lentils, broad beans, etc.</p>
<p>C. Vegetables: fresh green peas, Chinese cabbage, cabbage, etc.</p>
<p>D. Fruits: peanuts, hazelnuts, dried almonds, sweet almonds, dried walnuts.</p>
<p>2. Rich in Fat</p>
<p>Animal sources: A. Meats: various fatty meats, fats, bone marrow.</p>
<p>B. Fish: salmon, sturgeon liver, eels. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Economic Special</p>
<h3>Global Gold Reserves</h3>
<p>— Translated by Hu Yizang</p>
<p>The U.S. and France Lead the World</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that the global economic downturn has deepened in recent years, primarily due to the uneven distribution of gold. Although there was a slight shift in gold flows last year, the overall trend shows that gold remains concentrated in the U.S. and France. The gold reserves and currency circulation of the world's five major countries, converted at par value, are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>End of 1931 End of 1932</p>
<p>Gold Reserves (Millions of Dollars) U.S. 8,916 8,576 France 4,286 6,662 U.K. 1,210 1,210 Japan 470 425 Germany 1,108 400 Currency in Circulation (Millions of Dollars) U.S. 11,266 11,460 France 6,035 6,563 U.K. 3,640 3,700 Japan 1,159 1,233 Germany 2,138 1,700</p>
<p>Due to war debt payments, gold outflows reached $100 million in 1932. In France, political changes and financial instability led to a slight decrease in gold reserves. However, at the end of last year, reserves reached 8.33 billion, an 85% increase compared to the previous year. The U.K. reduced its reserves by £120 million after suspending the gold standard but recovered to £140 million by the end of last year. However, it paid approximately £20 million in war debt annuities on December 15th last year. Germany's current reserves are 999 million marks, but gold continues to flow out due to exchange controls. Japan's reserves have also sharply decreased by 40 million yuan since suspending the gold standard. Therefore, the U.S. and France remain the world leaders in gold reserves.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Modern Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>— Gao Jinyuan</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>The purpose of economics is to promote peace, stability, and the welfare of the general population. However, the recent economic situation has not only failed to stabilize the lives of ordinary people but has also plunged them into poverty. Since 1929, the world economy has been in a state of panic, reaching a dead end. Goods are stagnating, factories are closing down, and large numbers of workers are becoming unemployed, causing widespread suffering. Governments are facing reduced fiscal revenues, and society is filled with unrest. Therefore, governments and many scholars are advocating for a controlled economy to overcome the current economic crisis, alleviate the plight of the people, and attempt to reverse the crisis and benefit both people and resources. The core of controlled economy is the limit of the free market of capitalism and the interest of the capital should adhere to the whole people.</p>
<p>The advocacy of controlled economy has recently become extremely popular worldwide. Proponents believe that it is a panacea for the global recession and a fundamental strategy for rescuing rural areas, small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Impartially speaking, a controlled economy is indeed a method to reverse the economic crisis and save the economic lives of the people. It also attempts to fundamentally reform the economic structure, achieving a balanced relationship between production and consumption.</p>
<p>(II) What is a Controlled Economy?</p>
<p>Regarding controlled economy, I will now provide a simple explanation:</p>
<p>㈠ A controlled economy is a restricted economy, standing in opposition to a free economy. As exemplified by the orthodox school, especially Adam Smith, who strongly advocated for a laissez-faire economy, their ideas are no longer viable in today's economic climate. Therefore, a controlled economy, with its artificial restrictions, opposes this ideology.</p>
<p>㈡ A controlled economy is a planned economy, not an aimless artificial regulated economy. It involves pre-planning consumption within a certain economic domain to regulate production and align it with consumption. This is an economy based on a plan, which establishes the supply-demand relationship of various economic activities. A planned economy implies the regulation of production and consumption.</p>
<p>㈢ A controlled economy is a state-regulated economy, with the state as the controlling entity. In this context, viewing it as a supranational, global controlled economy is acceptable. However, in the current situation, this concept is likely too idealistic. Therefore, focusing on the state as a unit is more feasible. It is generally agreed that the state is the fairest controlling entity. Thus, horizontal or vertical controlled relationships within a business, or the combination or merging of businesses, should be excluded from the concept of a controlled economy.</p>
<p>From this perspective, a controlled economy is an economic system in which the state imposes restrictions based on a supply-demand plan within a certain economic domain.</p>
<p>(III) The Objectives of a Controlled Economy</p>
<p>The initial urgent tasks undertaken by a controlled economy include addressing economic inequality, overcoming economic recession, alleviating unemployment, and reorganizing ailing industries.</p>
<p>㈠ Reforming Economic Inequality</p>
<p>The primary objective of a controlled economy is to eliminate the root causes of economic inequality. Under the current economic organization of free competition, some individuals inevitably become immensely wealthy while others are plunged into poverty. Therefore, the first goal of a controlled economy is to use state power to reform the natural economic conditions of inequality in human society and save impoverished people. A controlled economy can be seen as an effective method of harmonizing production and consumption.</p>
<p>㈡ Overcoming Economic Recession</p>
<p>While there are various causes for the global economic panic, the main factors include the expansion of machinery, the proliferation of financial institutions, psychological factors, and deficiencies in commercial organizations. Commodity prices are volatile. While wholesale prices may be low, retail prices remain high. Furthermore, changes in wholesale prices take considerable time to impact the financial sector. Moreover, global prices underwent a downward trend after the war. Thus, the most challenging aspect of modern commercial organizations is the reduction in demand. A decline in demand manifests as unemployment and a decrease in purchasing power, significantly impacting general industries. Therefore, governments and scholars are strongly advocating for a controlled economy to address this issue. In short, the hardship of farmers and small/medium industries, cries of producers, persistent unemployment, and decreased purchasing power are indeed the issues that require urgent resolution today.</p>
<p>㈢ Reorganizing Weak Industries</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the decline of weak industries is the relatively or absolutely excessive production capacity of a particular industry. The existence of inefficient and costly production enterprises is another contributing factor. A controlled economy, from the state's perspective, must control these excessive production capacities and unify and reorganize ailing industries, including rural issues and small/medium industries.</p>
<p>㈣ Alleviating Unemployment</p>
<p>What are the causes of unemployment? According to general observation, a large part is the result of the development of mechanical production, which reduces the demand for labor. Unemployed workers lack purchasing power, and their demands cannot be expressed as market demand. Production aims to satisfy market demand. Therefore, production cannot utilize the unemployed. Efforts must be focused on absorbing the unemployed and promoting the new demand for products. Carrying out production for this new demand will use the unemployed and increase their purchasing power. Most capitalists want to avoid overproduction, but fail to appropriately produce based on demand. This is tragic from the perspective of unemployment.</p>
<p>(IV) Conclusion</p>
<p>An economy that is controlled for the interests of an individual, an organization, or an enterprise is not a true controlled economy. For example, limiting production, coordinating selling prices, suspending competition, and consolidating or cartelizing businesses are all economic activities that benefit individuals, companies, capitalists, and similar businesses, and are not true controlled economic activities. This type of economic movement uses the good name of controlled economy to defend the interests of individuals, companies, and businesses, and is not actually a controlled economy. A true controlled economy is focused on the overall national economy. This is called controlled economy. If a certain business is damaging to the national economy, the economic policies should promote great controlling activities. To put it simply, a controlled economy does not focus on an individual, a company, or a business. Even if a certain business or company is harmed, a direction must be set from the perspective of the national economy. Overall, the goal of a controlled economy is to build on the entirety of the national economy.</p>
<h3>Several Simple Methods for Calculating Bond Investment Returns (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wang Dunfu</p>
<p>(III) Hocart's Method This method was developed by Mr. Hocart of the National City Company of New York. The calculation results are still applicable.</p>
<p>Yield = (Interest Rate + (Face Value - Purchase Price) / Years to Maturity) ÷ (Purchase Price + Face Value) / 2 ... (6) (IV) Difference Annuity Method This method uses the difference annuity to calculate the yield, requiring the application of compound interest tables or logarithmic tables, making it slightly more complex than the previous methods. Yield = (Interest + Difference Annuity) / Purchase Price Difference Annuity = (Interest Rate x Purchase Price x (1 + Interest Rate)^Years to Maturity - 1) / Interest Rate ... (7)</p>
<p>In formula (7), the difference is the difference between the face value and the purchase price.</p>
<p>(B) Treasury Bill Yield Calculation Method The principal of treasury bills is repaid monthly, so the face value gradually decreases. The calculation method is also somewhat different from that of government bonds. The method used here was developed by Mr. Ma Jiupu, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The drawback is that it does not consider the length of the repayment period. The calculation method is as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Calculate the outstanding face value of the treasury bill.</p>
<p>(II) Divide the purchase price by the outstanding face value to get the discount.</p>
<p>(III) Calculate the difference between the original face value and the discount to get the discount difference.</p>
<p>(IV) Multiply the discount difference by the monthly repayment amount at the time of purchase to get the discount profit.</p>
<p>(V) Divide the purchase price by the sum of the monthly payment amount at the time of purchase and the discount profit to get the interest rate (monthly interest). The repayment of treasury bills increases periodically. When the repayment increases, the interest also increases. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the increased interest to compensate for these shortcomings. The calculation method is as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Calculate the difference between the current repayment amount and the increased repayment amount.</p>
<p>(II) Multiply the difference obtained by the discount difference to get the increased discount profit.</p>
<p>(III) Divide the purchase price by the increased discount profit to get the increased interest rate (monthly interest). The above treasury bill interest calculation method and increased yield calculation method are listed in the following formulas:</p>
<p>Yield = (Outstanding Face Value x Interest Rate) / Purchase Price + (Purchase Price - Outstanding Face Value x Monthly Repayment Amount) ... (8) Increased Yield = (Outstanding Face Value x (New Repayment Amount - Original Repayment Amount) / Purchase Price ... (9</p>

<h3>The Sunday Lilibor Market Was Even Quieter</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, and the market atmosphere was exceptionally quiet. The market price of foreign currency was still stable. The morning price was 7 qian 1 fen 3 li 2 hao 5 si, and the afternoon price was 7 qian 1 fen 3 li 3 hao 7 hu 5 si, resulting in a slight decrease of 1 hao 2 hu 5 si compared to the afternoon price of the previous day.

<h3>American Cotton Awaits Rural Relief Transfer</h3>
<p>New York, January 13th dispatch: The cotton market situation for the week is as follows: Grain and securities markets are stable. Cotton market participants purchased, and shorts covered. Brokerage firms also had some demand. Therefore, cotton prices rose. Spot cotton in the South was sold to some extent as a result. Hedging sales increased, but the selling pressure was not strong and did not indicate a significant weakening of the spot cotton position. The number of sales was absorbed during minor rallies. The possibility of Congress legislating in favor of inflation is now being discussed, related to the recent cotton purchases, but there is no more concrete basis for this. It is expected that the rural relief bill passed by the House of Representatives yesterday will encounter considerable opposition in the Senate, as it is believed that the Senate has another rural relief bill to compete with it. Currently, people often express long-term thinking regarding raw cotton, but in addition to this thinking, there are some indications of uncertainty in the cotton market's near future.</p>

<h3>Grain: River-Bottom Rice Floods the Market, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply of rice from the river bottom surged, with over eighty boats arriving. In addition, there is a backlog of over two thousand piculs. As dusk approached, people became anxious, and the market declined. However, when the "bianyuan" (variable price) rice was sold, there was a shortage of goods, and prices remained tight. Rice from the "Tongbang" (same-province) and "Nangang Qingjiao" (South Harbor Green Rice) groups, including "baodaohoudao" (thin rice, thick rice) and "yinyuan" (cloud rice), all fell by 12 cents. "Duyangjian" (Duyang pointed rice) remained stable.</p>
<p>Changbang white rice 11.00 to 10.30; Qingjiao late rice 9.75 to 9.40; Tongli white rice 10.00 to 9.80; Xintai late rice 9.50; North white rice 10.05 to 9.90; Sijing late rice 9.70; Lixing white rice 9.90 to 9.80; Jing late rice 9.50; Lulou white rice 9.70 to 9.60; Lai rice also 9.50; Pingwang white rice 9.90 to 9.70; Bridge late rice 9.60; Shengze white rice 9.70 to 9.50; Xitang late rice 9.20 to 9.15; Zhouzhuang white rice 9.70 to 9.50; Liantang late rice 9.25; Taozhuang white rice 9.70 to 9.50; Songjiang late rice 9.70 to 9.30; Zhenze white rice 10.00 to 9.90; Jing late rice 9.30; Chenmu white rice 10.00 to 9.90; Luxiang early rice 9.60 to 9.50; Changbang bianyuan 12.30; Zhangyan early rice 9.90 to 9.80; Songjiang yinyuan 10.50; Song early rice 9.70 to 9.60; Lili yinyuan 10.20 to 10.; early rice 9.80 to 9.70; Tongli yinyuan 10.30 to 10.; Kuoxia early rice 9.90; Tongli yangjian 10.00; Tinglin early rice 10.00 to 9.90; Lili yangjian 10.00; Tongli lujain 10.00; North yangjian 10.00; Xincang jian 9.60</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over fifty boats arrived from the river bottom. Shops and warehouses were backlogged. Country villages lacked transactions. Market prices were expected to fall by three cents, with mid-grade rice down by four or five cents. Deliveries of "baodao" (thin rice) were abundant, and retail transactions were flat, with prices falling by one or two "chi" (a unit of measurement). "Yangbu xian" (Yangbu indica rice) also weakened by more than one "chi". "Dujian" (Du pointed rice) decreased slightly by two cents. "Kejian" (guest pointed rice) weakened by a few cents. "Yinyuan" (cloud rice) and "bianyuan" (variable price) rice also fell by three or four cents.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Slightly Down by 0.05 Taels</h3>
<p>Although the price of Diaoqing sugar has increased... buying interest is weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was quiet and the trend remained weak. The guild set the price for No. 24 raw sugar at 15 taels and 7.5 qian, down by 0.05 taels from the previous day. There were few transactions. No. 8 Dutch red sugar was priced at 12 taels and 3 qian, and No. 9 at 12 taels and 5 qian, both down by a few qian. No. 10 sugar was scarce and still priced at 12 taels and 7 qian.</p>
<p>The Chaozhou group offered several hundred packages of Zhongzhuang semi-South Green sugar at 8 taels and 4.5 to 5 qian. The Shantou group offered several hundred packages of ordinary sliced green sugar at 8 taels. However, the inventory was indeed thin, so subsequent offers were at 8 taels and 2 or 3 qian, and high-quality sugar at 8 taels and 6 qian, but no transactions occurred.</p>
<p>The Jianzhou group continued to offer several dozen packages of Diaoqing sugar at 9 taels and 5.5 qian. According to telegrams from Zhangzhou, land prices have risen, but Shanghai traders' buying interest is weak. Moreover, as the close of the year approaches, there is little hope for improvement.</p>
<h3>Areas for Improvement in Domestic Green Sugar</h3>
<p>Since the tariff on foreign sugar was increased last year, sugar-producing areas in Fujian and Guangdong provinces in our country have indeed been expanding production. Recently, the number of Chaoqing sugar arrivals has increased daily, and Diaoqing sugar is also arriving one after another, which is a good sign. However, among the Chaoqing sugar that has arrived this year, while there is some high-quality sugar, most of it is of lower quality, which has prevented it from gaining an advantage in the market. If the quality can be improved to make it purer and free from impurities, then there will be no sediment after the sugar is made. Furthermore, if care is taken to ensure that the heat is moderate and the moisture is reduced when boiling the sugar juice, then the sugar will be dry and of good color after it is made. Moreover, if those in the industry can always bear in mind the desire to increase the status of domestic sugar and study and improve it everywhere, then it will not be difficult to surpass foreign sugar and restore its position.</p>
<p>Since the new Diaoqing sugar from Zhangzhou was produced this year, the number of arrivals has not been high, but it is said that the production volume has indeed increased, unlike in previous years, and the quality of the goods is worse than before. This is undeniable. The key points that urgently need to be improved are described below:</p>
<p>(1) [Appearance] In the past, Diaoqing sugar was mostly dry and yellow, but now the opposite is true. The reason is that the owners in the production area are greedy for weight and increase their profits, and do not remove all the moisture. They must know that they should not be greedy for temporary benefits, as they will be eliminated.</p>
<p>(2) Sugar kernels, that is, the lumps of sugar. It has been found that the kernels of the inferior Diaoqing sugar this year are numerous and large. The reason is that the sugar is damp and poorly made. Not only is the appearance unsightly, it is a characteristic of inferior sugar quality. If it is not improved soon, it will not only be difficult to compete with foreign sugar, but it will not even be able to compete with Chaoqing sugar.</p>

<h3>Master and Apprentice (1)</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>Clang, clang; the master, shirtless, the muscles on his arms all taut, his strength striking the newly-taken-out, boiling red iron! Sparks flew far and wide with a crackling sound, and the master struck hard, as if all the pent-up anger in his heart was entrusted to that iron! I, on the side, pulled the bellows and touched the large swelling on my foot that the master had caused yesterday! I felt that my fingers were greasy, as if they were festering with dripping, thick blood. I thought of how the master's temper had suddenly turned so fierce recently! A thought then turned to [leaving];</p>
<p>Leave! Where to go? Go home? My dad's eyes would definitely be as big as copper bells, his voice like a lion's roar;</p>
<p>[I've said it! You beast! Our family doesn't have food to feed you! A rope, a knife!]</p>
<p>Mom was trembling all over with anger, and tears were streaming down her face, as she pointed her finger at the tip of my nose, her voice broken;</p>
<p>[You... you... you good-for-nothing... can't even learn to be a blacksmith!... Go... go back to selling tofu skin!]</p>
<p>To give Mom some credit, I should master this trade! It would be a respectable thing to go back home once I’ve learned everything! But lately, I've been hungry every day! Beaten by the master every day! And I have to be heartbroken thinking about my master's daughter every day! But I can't bear it anymore!</p>
<p>I don't know why, my heart soured, and tears dripped down!</p>
<p>[Your old man isn't dead yet! Why are you crying like your mother! Are you tired of living here! Get out!] The master, in passing, gave me another hammer blow to my spine, and my heart was like a piece of iron! With this blow, sparks flew out! I'm definitely leaving! Why am I always so soft and weak! There's not a bit of manly strength in me! Mom and Dad don't want me to go home: I'll just wander around outside, all alone! Or I'll beg door to door to survive! But thinking about it... I think of my master's daughter; that round little face, two small circles embedded in her tender cheeks! A pair of eyes like two stars in the night, shining straight through the darkness in the bottom of one’s heart... Wait! The master’s daughter will come back one day, and my heart softens again!</p>
<p>I started thinking dreamily:</p>
<p>A few months ago!</p>
<p>The master was sitting on a wooden stool, singing, and my master's daughter and I were cooking for the master in the kitchen. I wanted my master's daughter to stoke the fire, and I would work at the stove, but my master's daughter refused. The two of us started arguing, and the master heard us.</p>
<p>[What are you arguing about again! Ah Zhen: let Da Mao work at the stove, and you stoke the fire! Have you forgotten the year your mother died, when the family was so poor that we didn't have a single grain of rice, and you went to pick wild vegetables to eat with tears in your eyes! Now we have food and clothing! Don't be too happy!] (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Ten Years Later (4)</h3>
<p>— Mo Ji</p>
<p>It was a long kiss. But I felt cold. That fragrance had been trampled on!</p>
<p>[Also,] her vermilion lips left mine, and she said again, [If I am killed by brave soldiers in the future, then please sculpt a statue of me and place it on your desk to commemorate my past youth! Now please leave, the comrades fighting on the front lines are waiting for you to join them!]</p>
<p>She pushed me away ｜｜｜ pushed me away from her embrace.</p>
<p>[Is this the new strength you're giving me, girl?] I asked.</p>
<p>[Yes.] She nodded.</p>
<p>[Then goodbye ｜｜｜ goodbye in the future, girl Ying'er!]</p>
<p>[The future... see you in the near future!] She stood up.</p>
<p>I left her bedroom. We shook hands at the door, and I kissed her.</p>
<p>The east had already shot out a faint red, beautiful sunlight, illuminating my run forward! (The End)</p>
<h3>Learning to Be Smart</h3>
<p>— Zhao Mianzhi</p>
<p>Eat one loss, learn one lesson. Abolish the imperial examination, establish schools, establish constitutional government, revitalize industry, train a new army, establish a republic, overthrow warlords... these are all countermeasures for us to learn to be smart, and whether there are good results is not yet a concern. Recently, it has turned into the era of [science and technology saving the nation]. Among many new types of machinery, we especially need airplanes, so [aviation saving the nation] has become a slogan that hits the current needs.</p>
<p>We don't not have airplanes. Just talking about the September 18th Incident in the three northeastern provinces, the Japanese army also snatched two or three hundred airplanes. Talking about air combat, it's not like there is no achievement at all. Let’s not talk about our past. After January 28th, General Chen Jitang once used airplanes to sink the Flying Eagle at Haikou, Hainan. General Han Fuju used airplanes to make a show of force when he pacified Shandong. Although at the time Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen and others suffered the intimidation of Japanese airplanes in the Northeast, they didn't have half an airplane to help them. It is true that airplanes are very useful. The Soviet Union uses them to spread seeds for farmers, we use them to bomb Flying Eagle, and the Japanese army uses them to invade China. Airplanes are a powerful weapon, just like new types of weapons and armies, they can be used for [good], and they can also be used for [bad].</p>
<p>If we really want to learn to be smart, we should pay attention to using them to [do good].</p>
<p>For example, we have been training our army for decades, and the number of people is indeed not small, but they are used to fight ourselves, so it is better not to have them. Once there are more airplanes, and they are used in the same way, it is possible that the public will suffer another disaster.</p>
<p>Don't misunderstand, aviation is indeed a way to save the country at the moment. I am not opposed to aviation. My hope is to use airplanes to do good, and not turn them into private airplanes. Because experience tells us that private things are always more willing to serve private interests. The lack of airplanes to bomb Flying Eagle when Generals Ma Zhanshan and Cai Tingkai resisted Japan is one example.</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw and Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Lao Su</p>
<p>The great Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw is truly old but vigorous. Although he is over seventy years old, he is still tirelessly running around. He returned from a trip to South Africa last spring, and now he is starting a grand tour around the world. According to a recent dispatch, Shaw will arrive in China on the 17th of next month, and it is said that after he arrives in China, he will also take a plane to visit the famous Great Wall.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world knows that this old literary giant is a witty old man. He has a talking mouth, and what he says is always to the point and makes people laugh and cry. Recently, he actually said that the natives of Africa are superior to white people, which will make the [white gentlemen] in [the European temple] very unhappy.</p>
<p>Three years ago, his old friend Lord Plunkett, a seventy-six-year-old Irish politician, suddenly became interested and went to the aircraft field in Bloomfontein to learn how to fly an airplane every day. Shaw, because he was so happy, [humorously] said to him: [It is certainly an adventurous pleasure for someone your age to learn how to fly an airplane. But I think, if you want to commit suicide, there are many other reliable methods.]</p>
<p>This year, when Shaw and his wife were traveling in South Africa, they actually learned to be fashionable in Cape Town and took a plane ride. This unprecedented first aerial trip made the solitary and outrageous old literary master exclaim that it was the first exciting thing since he was seventy-five years old. Three years ago, [unreliable suicide] has now become the most exciting thing in his life; the old politician Lord Plunkett can say [I am not alone].</p>
<p>After Shaw comes to China, no matter what his impressions of China are, we will definitely hear hot and spicy words coming from between his little mustache. Moreover, when he goes to visit the magnificent Great Wall, this old literary giant takes the [unreliable suicide] plane and flies among the [murder] planes of the Japanese army full of gas and bombs, I think he will definitely feel that although airplanes are unreliable for suicide, they are very reliable for killing people.</p>
<h3>To an Old Friend</h3>
<p>— Ms. Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>E...</p>
<p>Has it been five years since we separated? I've almost forgotten how much earlier you left Beijing than I did, and I've even forgotten when our news became like a kite with a broken string, disappearing without a trace ever since. No wind blew, no rain fell, but our friendship scattered like fallen flowers! E, memories after understanding things are bitter, only childhood scenes are deeply engraved in the heart, and that kind of memory is sweet in every inch. I've met returning travelers who had also lived in the north five years since coming South. When we sit knee to knee and talk about the scenery of the North, I often cry for joy! [Talking about the old days in a foreign land], I have truly felt this kind of mood. Although Beijing is not my hometown, I will never forget Beijing.</p>
<p>You should have gone to university, right? If it weren't for my illness, wouldn't I be the same as you? But I also have to be deeply grateful to myself for taking things a little slower and suffering a little less. Under the current aristocratic education system, it is not easy to step into the high threshold of university! I hesitate, wondering whether to struggle or let my fate run its course? In this turbulent era! How pitifully the poor have been made prisoners of it, when will they turn over? I look at the gray sky and sigh darkly. Life for me is neither enjoyment nor a game, but only oppression. I open my arms and circle in the sky, I want to find a devil, it cruelly killed many weak people, threw them into the sea without a trace, only their tragic cries floating along with the tiny waves.</p>
<p>Years of life experience have been bitter for me, I have lived through contradictions, and I know that I have become a very unhealthy person! This is to say that in terms of the mind, I am suffering great pain and have become a mentally unhealthy person. I have always been struggling straightforwardly and bravely, but my emotions are still burning like fire in my heart. I am like standing on a mountain peak in the morning breeze, feeling cold and peaceful, but the sparks of the times are spreading in front of my eyes in small pieces. I am willing to stand at the forefront of the times and work hard to move forward, but no one tells me what it is for! Really, no one can tell me. Isn't this a joke? But don't laugh at me, E, you should know that Xiao Peng's heart is so weak. Encourage me, let me be more decisive, boldly and honestly wave the flag and shout on the journey of life, my slogan is to enrich our lives! We must be self-aware, we must be lively!</p>
<p>How many old friends from Pingzhong are corresponding? I didn't expect that the lively situation at that time has scattered like this now! Perhaps, we will meet on the journey in ten or eight years, and at that time, we will face each other with smiles and tell our own stories.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<h3>Lamenting the Martyrs' Tomb of the May 30th Movement</h3>
<p>— Xingzhi</p>
<p>With a pious respect I pilgrimage before your martyrs' tomb</p>
<p>Though not mourning the past to criticize the present</p>
<p>I cannot help but look up to the sky and sob</p>
<p>Martyrs, do you also hold long-lasting hatred and weep in the underworld?</p>
<p>The wind is cold and the days are short</p>
<p>The grass on your graves is already thin and withered</p>
<p>Even more so, the goshawks cry, and foxes run and hares lurk in the tombsides</p>
<p>Martyrs, the bloodstains on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>Have long been lightly covered by dust</p>
<p>But there are still some heroes running and shouting</p>
<p>There are still some patriots calling out in pain</p>
<p>Martyrs, the grass tag of sale has already been inserted on your tombs</p>
<p>You have seen the wind rush the earth from your bloodstains</p>
<p>See, the raging winds and storms and whether the land and rivers remain as of old</p>
<p>Martyrs, if your heroic souls are not extinguished</p>
<p>Are you willing to give up?</p>
<p>Last year, this place was a mountain of corpses again</p>
<p>Until now, the will-o'-the-wisps flicker, and the wronged souls cry out miserably</p>
<p>Martyrs, are you lonely in the underworld and reaching out to recruit companions?</p>
<p>It is said that the bloodstains at the Great Light are always blurred</p>
<p>How can this long night never reach its end?</p>
<p>Martyrs, how can we endure the long demon mists covering the Qiu?</p>
<p>The golden rooster on your tomb stands upright with outstretched neck</p>
<p>How much longer will it be before the east turns white and crow is heard?</p>
<p>Martyrs, I am waiting for the sound of the rooster to draw my sword and dance!</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Era and Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Haiquan, holding a towel and toothbrush, walked towards the doorway. Just as he reached the staircase, he ran into that Japanese fellow again. Haiquan almost burst out laughing at his strange appearance. Because today, this Japanese man had completely changed into a set of Chinese clothes, and he was even wearing a melon-shaped hat with a red tassel on his head. When he saw Haiquan, he bowed deeply again in a respectful manner. Haiquan had no choice but to return the bow. Haiquan thought, there must be something strange going on; why is this Japanese man pretending to be Chinese?</p>
<p>[Mr. Lin, is it alright to take a half-day off? How about accompanying us to see a movie this afternoon?]</p>
<p>Mrs. Tsuruko followed him to the bathroom door. While he washed up inside, she stood by the door, as if unwilling to leave him. The nanny came up with a pot of hot water, but she didn't let the nanny handle it, instead taking the hot water pot and pouring it into the porcelain basin for Haiquan. She seemed to be intentionally squeezing close to his side. He smelled an unprecedented fragrance that would make one feel intoxicated, and his heart fluttered again.</p>
<p>[Why not just take a whole day off? Spend the day out with her.]</p>
<p>At this point, he could no longer deny his longing for her. Because the intruder who had just arrived from Japan had prevented them from being close for more than a week. He very much wanted to accompany her to a secluded place where no one would bother them, to enjoy a day of uninhibited wandering, in order to make up for the estrangement of the past few days.</p>
<p>(19)</p>
<p>After washing up, Haiquan walked back to his room on the second floor alone. He thought that Mrs. Tsuruko would definitely follow him. However, he sat at his desk and flipped through this morning's newspaper for a while, but she still didn't come up.</p>
<p>Although he was flipping through the newspaper, he didn't register any of the news in it. He only saw the names of many important people, 丨丨丨 Chiang Kai-shek, Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, Zhang Xueliang, Li Jishen, etc., 丨丨丨 dancing on the newspaper page. Some were dancing the foxtrot, some were dancing the waltz, and some were dancing the blues. They all danced the same old tune. So he threw the newspaper aside, unwilling to read it anymore. He wanted to re-examine his feelings for Mrs. Tsuruko.</p>

<h3>Dreaming</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Dreams are, in fact, extremely ordinary things. Everyone has the ability to dream. Although the dreams of a beggar woman sleeping in an alley may not be as perfect as the sweet dreams of a commissioner's wife, she may be fortunate enough to eat a full bowl of plain noodles in her dream, which is still worth being quite happy about. Therefore, dreams are not so bad after all. That's why the ancient sages, great philosophers, and the upright gentlemen of today are all willing to have good dreams, pursuing everything they seek in their dreams.</p>
<p>For example, a passionate young master who is having a lucky streak in love hopes for sweet dreams, wishing to embrace his lover in a luxurious hotel, kissing her countless times. A small peanut vendor dreams of picking up a bundle of banknotes next to a certain car, and actually gets through the end of the lunar year. A small shop assistant in a store dreams of winning the first prize of 390,000. A moralistic scholar dreams that the Japanese imperialists have a change of heart and voluntarily withdraw from the Northeast, and that other powers also swear not to carve up China. A patriotic junior official dreams that the government has issued a mobilization order to carry out armed resistance. An old virtuous person who fasts and chants Buddhist scriptures dreams that the living Buddha has indeed moved the Jade Emperor and is saving all living beings.</p>
<p>However, these are all ordinary dreams of ordinary people, perhaps insignificant. As for the big figures with great ambitions, the dreams they have are naturally bigger and grander. For example, a grand marshal who holds heavy troops hopes to dream of the Heavenly Book of the Nine Heavens Mystic Lady, just like Song Gongming, the timely rain who acts on behalf of heaven, so that he can govern the country and bring peace to the world. No matter how the rebel troops occupy the opportune time, geographical advantages, and popular support, they cannot move his tiger-skin throne even half a bit. In the event that the Xiongnu raise troops and invade southward, he can still become a founding hero with just a letter of surrender.</p>
<p>Next, for those who are like romantic princes, of course, their dreams still do not lose their romantic nature. For example, when the bandits have already entered the pass and they know that they are as thin as firewood, they cannot resist tanks, airplanes, and poisonous cannons. Even if they have [short guns] and [black bubbles], they are useless. Therefore, it is better to engage in romance again and have a beautiful butterfly dream.</p>
<p>Therefore, dreams differ just as people do. And when the world is peaceful, the five grains are abundant, and all industries are thriving, our well-fed and clothed people may as well each seek good dreams. If the great dream ends and everything is empty, then we can have a good cry at that time.</p>

<h3>A Cheap and Effective Fire Extinguisher</h3>
<p>— Gong</p>
<p>Fire is the most terrible thing. If one is not careful, it can cause trouble. Therefore, everyone usually prepares a fire extinguisher to prevent it. This article describes a very cheap and effective fire extinguisher. The materials used are only an empty bottle and a bottle cap (soda bottles are very suitable), as well as the vinegar and baking soda that we usually eat. As for the making process, it is also very simple. First, take the ordinary concentrated vinegar and mix it with two parts water. Pour the mixture into the empty bottle, filling it to about three-quarters of the bottle. Then, wrap the baking soda in paper that easily gets damp, such as Chinese rough-edged paper. Then, use a string to tie up this package of baking soda at one end, and pull the other end out from the small hole that has been drilled in the bottle cap, so that the package of baking soda does not touch the vinegar. After doing this, immediately seal the end of the string on the cap with sealing wax or something similar, so that it cannot go down and hangs the package of baking soda in the air of the bottle. After this, an easy fire extinguisher is completed. When using it, simply shake the bottle a few times to make the vinegar touch the paper. The paper, because it is wet, cannot bear the weight of the baking soda and breaks. As a result, the baking soda falls into the vinegar. But vinegar and baking soda have a chemical reaction. In this chemical change, a large amount of gas is generated. This large amount of gas breaks through the sealing of the small hole and surrounds the burning object. As a result, the fire is extinguished because it cannot get the supply of oxygen.</p>

<p>The Strange Drama of the Principal Personally Supervising the Exam</p>
<p>The news that the principal would personally supervise the exam, inadvertently revealed by each professor, alarmed the university students who hoped to wear square caps.</p>
<p>×× University, called a "chicken university" by the people of Shanghai, has always adopted a laissez-faire approach to students. As long as you pay enough for the three expenses 丨丨 tuition, board, and lodging, everything else is up to you, except that you can't bring women to the school. Actions such as having classmates take attendance in the classroom are as common as needing to have a bowel movement after eating. Therefore, although the professors invited are nominally gold-plated or silver-plated scholars, in reality, they still need to go to elementary school to listen to lectures for a few years. However, they have superior abilities to prevent their students, who are their food and clothing providers, from engaging in unreasonable disturbances such as beatings and expulsions. Moreover, they are all relatives of the principal. The principal secretly told them that they should only try to please the students, not make them angry, which is now a great violation of the principle of making money.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>After the initial opening, it was indeed possible to earn 20% interest each year. The principal had already taken a second concubine, and the gold-plated scholars had also taken off their blue cloth gowns and put on gabardine suits. However, nothing in the world can be hidden if you do it yourself. Since the name of the "chicken university" spread far and wide, business immediately declined. The mentality of parents all over the world is always to hope that their sons will study hard and become officials and get rich in the future. The "chicken university" has been exposed as a sham and is no longer worth a penny. Therefore, in the last two semesters, only a few young masters have been coming and going at the school gate. The principal, recognizing the situation, wanted to restore the reputation of the initial opening, so he convened a school affairs meeting. After their secret discussion, the news that the principal would personally supervise the exam slowly spread from the mouths of each professor. The impact of this news was not small. Since entering the school, they had never seen the principal's face, and since he was said to be personally supervising the exam, it would be more difficult to deal with him than with these few professors. Therefore, those who were diligent burned the midnight oil, while those who were less so refined their cheating skills to the extreme.</p>
<p>When the exam began, sure enough, the principal wore dark glasses and sat there majestically supervising the exam. However, in less than five minutes, the doorman handed in a card, and the principal bowed to welcome that distinguished guest and left, never to return. For two days in a row, they were just copying old articles. The future scholars were of course all geniuses with top-notch intelligence, and they knew that the principal's personal supervision was nothing more than that. From the third day on, no more fools were seen burning the midnight oil. During the exam, after the principal left to meet guests, paper balls still flew around the classroom as usual, and cheating devices rattled the roof tiles. The two professors crossed their right legs over their left legs, reading their newspapers for the day, or avoiding the gaze of the future scholars.</p>
<p>The strange drama of a school affairs meeting held in secret discussion provided the future scholars with a lot of talking points. As for whether the principal could restore the previous reputation with his decisive actions, the reporter has no way of knowing. A friend told me this story, so I record it here to amuse the readers.</p>
<h3>Attempt</h3>
<p>— Zhennian</p>
<p>The weather was obviously terribly cold, and the outside of the window was covered with a white snow scene.</p>
<p>Guarding the stove, embracing a beautiful concubine, and admiring this once-in-a-year snow scene in a tall Western-style house would of course be enviable... But as someone who earns a fixed salary, I couldn't help but step on the snowy street, brave the cold wind, and go to the company.</p>
<p>There were always more than a dozen rickshaws parked at the entrance of the neighborhood. Normally, they wouldn't pay attention to me when I came out, but today they swarmed up and surrounded me. I had a monthly pass for the streetcar and felt that I wasn't qualified to have someone else run errands for me, so I still broke through the encirclement and maintained my consistent stance.</p>
<p>Before I had walked twenty steps, a rickshaw puller shouted loudly behind me, pulling the rickshaw and chasing after me. I stopped to listen to him.</p>
<p>[Sir, take a ride! I'm still hungry.]</p>
<p>A man from Jiangbei, about forty years old, with a dry yellow face, long, messy hair, and no hat, had no overcoat to protect him from the snow; one foot was in an old cloth shoe, and the other foot was in a broken galosh, tied with a rope; he was shivering in front of me, and his voice was trembling.</p>
<p>[I have to get on the rickshaw and save him.] I thought, jumping onto the rickshaw.</p>
<p>The rickshaw wheels were sliding on the slippery ice, the cold snow, and the wet asphalt road.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller's two feet, step by step, were also sliding on the slippery ice, the cold snow, and the wet asphalt road. A sharp, cold wind flew horizontally from the street corner, and the rickshaw puller desperately charged against it. I in the rickshaw barely managed to catch my breath.</p>
<p>Saliva drooled from the corners of the rickshaw puller's mouth, and puffs of hot air were exhaled, like a weak old mule hauling a heavy freight car.</p>
<p>The old mule wanted to rest, and the mule driver whipped it hard; this rickshaw puller also wanted to rest, and I was sitting on top, invisibly whipping him. I became ashamed. I only took his rickshaw to help him, but now I was mistreating him, enslaving him, coercing him, and taking his life.</p>
<p>[He's still pulling me while he's hungry!] I really wanted to jump down halfway; I was too cruel. I was deeply repenting, why didn't I just give him some money instead of insisting on taking his rickshaw? I have a monthly streetcar pass.</p>
<p>Another gust of sharp, cold wind blew onto the rickshaw, and I curled up, afraid to move.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the company gate, I hurriedly jumped down and involuntarily gave him twice the fare. He wiped the sweat from his face and said contentedly:</p>
<p>[Thank you, I'll be waiting for you again tomorrow.]</p>
<p>I felt a little relieved in my heart after hearing this, and strode into the company gate, but I didn't want to take a rickshaw anymore, no matter how heavy the snow was or how cold the weather was, I would still take my streetcar. 一, 十四,</p>
<p>Clerk's Correspondence</p>
<h3>Marriage Problem</h3>
<p>Remedying a Great Mistake After It Has Been Made</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am from Luodian Town in Baoshan County. My father is a businessman, and my family is of average means. I received eight years of school education, from elementary school all the way to the first year of the county normal school. The year before last, my father thought that business was more promising and ordered me to work as an apprentice in a foreign goods store in Shanghai. I was slightly affected by the [January 28th] Shanghai Incident, but I can still stand on my own feet.</p>
<p>When I was studying at Baoshan County Normal School, I met Miss A. Although we were classmates for only a short time, we were very compatible with each other, so we secretly made a marriage agreement. Unexpectedly, last August, my father took it upon himself to arrange another marriage for me with Miss B in my hometown. He didn't send a letter to inform me beforehand, only asking me the date of the wedding afterwards. I was very embarrassed after receiving the above news. If I agree, then how can I be worthy of Miss A! If I don't agree, wouldn't I be making my father difficult? I cannot escape the sin of being unfilial! Therefore, I am anxious day and night, and I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Recently, your newspaper has added a "Clerk's Correspondence" column, which is dedicated to answering difficult questions for clerks. I dare to send a letter asking for guidance, hoping that you will not hesitate to offer your valuable opinions and give me detailed instructions. I am extremely expectant.</p>
<p>Pan Shaoyu. Nineteen years old.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In Mr. Pan's case, the first mistake was in privately making a marriage agreement with Miss A without seeking the consent of his parents. If he had reported it at that time, then how would Mr. Pan's father have arranged for Miss B? It must be known that "the marriage agreement of an unmarried man or woman should obtain the consent of the legal guardian" is stipulated in Article 974 of the Civil Code. Furthermore, he made another mistake in not seeking Mr. Pan's opinion before his father arranged for Miss B, only notifying Mr. Pan afterwards, causing Mr. Pan to have no opportunity to speak. This also violates the principle stipulated in Article 972 of the Civil Code that "a marriage agreement should be made by the man and woman themselves." Based on the above judgments, aren't these two marriage agreements fundamentally invalid? Mr. Pan can choose whatever he wants, right? But that's not the case! Because refusing Miss A would be emotionally unbearable; even if he refuses Miss B, then Miss A, who is a good-faith third party, will suffer damage, and he will bear considerable responsibility both morally and legally. Moreover, the first to be blamed is Mr. Pan's father: it is truly as Mr. Pan said, "How can I escape the sin of being unfilial!" Therefore, this matter is fundamentally a great mistake that has already been made. For the current plan, the only option is to find a way to remedy it. There really is no straightforward solution.</p>
<p>We believe that Mr. Pan should first investigate Miss B's character and learning. If they are too far apart and she absolutely cannot be his lifelong partner, then he should resolutely object based on the provisions of Article 972 of the Civil Code. This is necessary for the sake of lifelong happiness, and it is not just for the sake of fulfilling the marriage agreement with Miss A. If Miss B's character and learning are still quite acceptable, then he may as well tell Miss A everything, ask to cancel the previous agreement, and remain friends forever, and then decide on a course of action based on her attitude. According to our speculation, Miss A's attitude will ultimately fall into one of the following four categories. ㈠ Because she is continuing her studies, she has already developed contempt for Mr. Pan, who is now engaged in business. Upon hearing Mr. Pan's words, she will gladly comply. ㈡ When the marriage agreement was made, perhaps she also did not seek the consent of her parents, and she is currently in the same predicament as Mr. Pan. Upon hearing Mr. Pan's words, she will gladly comply. (3) Upon hearing Mr. Pan's words, she believes that Mr. Pan's love for her has already wavered, and she permits it out of disappointment and resentment. ㈣ Her feelings are genuine, and she has no intention of marrying anyone but Mr. Pan. If Miss A's attitude belongs to the first type, then Mr. Pan can break off the relationship with her completely: there is no need to preserve even the friendship. If it is the second type, then he can only bear the pain and sever the relationship to achieve the best of both worlds: as for future friendly relations, it will depend on the future circumstances of both parties. If it is the third type, then although Miss A's feelings are touching, her love is not absolutely unshakable, and it is still not a pity to abandon it: the temporary wounds can be healed over time. At most, he can postpone his own wedding date until after Miss A gets married, so that he can have a clear conscience. However, once Miss A's attitude belongs to the fourth type, then Miss A's character and feelings are supreme: what good fortune to be able to have such a woman as a companion. For the sake of personal happiness, there is of course no reason to abandon her for someone else, and the best strategy is to refuse Miss B. Even if it causes difficulty for his father, he can't care about it so much. Moreover, a Miss B who is a complete stranger, in this era of collapsing morality, probably won't be too embarrassed, right?</p>

<h3>The Story of the Mischievous Boy Jackie Cooper on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Jackie Cooper is just a child of about nine years old, but he is more adept at all kinds of mischief and adventure than ordinary children. Although fighting and making noise during the day and going to bed early at night are unavoidable for ordinary children, he, although a child, likes to play football, drive cars, and do all kinds of bold and adventurous games with adults.

According to his mother, once, Jackie was playing football in the parlor and accidentally broke his grandmother's antique vase from thirty years ago. However, by the time his grandmother arrived, he had already taken off his clothes, preparing for his grandmother's spanking, and he declared that he was willing to use all of his salary to compensate for the antique vase!</p>
<p>His father unfortunately passed away when he was two years old, so he can hardly remember his father's face.

<h3>Clara Bow's Autobiography</h3>
<p>— Luo Xiu</p>
<p>I was born in Brooklyn, New York. My birthday is July 29th.</p>
<p>When I was in high school there, I loved to play with the boys. Because I loved to mess up my hair, everyone thought it was beautiful and said that I was quite suitable for the film industry. Coincidentally, a screen contest was held by a *Photoplay* magazine, and my father filled out all the forms and sent them in along with my photo. After several weeks, I wasn't included in the contestants published in the magazine, and I thought I had lost all hope. Unexpectedly, one day, I received a letter signed by the three judges of the contest, asking me to come for an interview.</p>
<p>On the day of the interview, there were about a dozen girls together. A week later, I actually won first place. The happiness at that time was truly indescribable. I thought of myself as a movie star.</p>
<p>When I got to Hollywood, Elinor Glyn appreciated me very much and immediately asked me to play the lead role in *It*.</p>
<p>I played in *It*, and *It* made me a star. And my most recent film, *Call Her Savage*, is my first work after joining Fox.</p>
<p>What I love most are the many letters written to me by fans. I often treasure these many letters. People always like to inquire about my favorite color. My favorite colors are silk and red.</p>
<p>I love sports, especially football, and I am also able to do everything else, such as horse riding, swimming, and sprinting. When we lived in Nevada, my husband, Rex Bell, actually treated me like a female jockey. And my ability to drive a car is no less than that of a man.</p>
<p>I can't live without love. I think love is a very real thing in life. I am very happy because I found a husband like Rex Bell.</p>
<h3>Movie Star's Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>— Sen</p>
<p>It's certainly not good to be ignored, but it's also a pain to be exhausted from dealing with too many people who are trying to curry favor. Chinese dignitaries often have unknown whereabouts for fear of being surrounded by news reporters. Unexpectedly, Hollywood stars also have to have unknown whereabouts because, although they have no news to provide, there are many movie enthusiasts who want to trouble them to leave some autographs as a source of honor.</p>
<p>Many, many young people, even children, often wait in groups somewhere, waiting for the star they admire to come out of some restaurant or coffee shop, so that they can ask the star to leave an autograph in the booklet they are holding. It is enough trouble for anyone to deal with so many requests, and it is not known when those requests can be completely fulfilled.</p>
<p>Therefore, one of the daily tasks of a big star is how to make themselves "whereabouts unknown". There are many social engagements that cannot be avoided, and daily necessities must be purchased by oneself in order to be satisfactory. This way, they cannot hide at home forever, so they have to seek help from disguise. The procedure is also very simple, because if it is too troublesome, it would be more trouble than it is worth. The most common thing is to wear a pair of dark glasses when going out. If it is a certain star, in addition to wearing glasses, sometimes wearing a fake beard is also very common. Changing into a set of clothes that they usually don't wear is also their usual trick. When Marlene Dietrich goes out, she often changes into a set of men's clothes, covering her high-heeled leather shoes with a pair of long leggings, but wearing a woman's hat on her head. This kind of outfit is originally popular in American society, but for Marlene, it is a kind of deception.</p>

The so-called artistic aspect, because the existence of American film cities, can not be said to be completely unrelated to art also.</p>
<p>The source of H. P.'s news is of course extremely reliable. According to his prediction, the subversion of Hollywood is related to a major economic abuse. This major abuse is said to present an unprecedented spectacle, that is, even the great scam of the Match King Kruger is not as great,</p>

<p>Ye Juanjuan, who works as an actress for several companies, went to Suzhou with the Da Zhong Company last year to film exterior scenes for [The Lone Army]. Unexpectedly, during the filming of a scene depicting a battle between two armies, a real bloodbath occurred. At the same time, Yang Liuqing and another soldier also died.</p>
<p>Ye Juanjuan is an extremely timid person. Witnessing the tragic deaths of the two men, she was constantly frightened in her heart. She even woke up startled from her bed at night. Therefore, the company was genuinely worried about her.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 9th), her scenes were finished. She didn't even take her luggage and immediately returned to Shanghai. The reasons she rushed back to Shanghai were firstly, to leave what she considered a terrifying place as soon as possible, and secondly, she was eager to see Mr. Qian and little George, whom she had been apart from for more than a month.</p>

<h3>A Young Girl Becomes a Mother</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, Luo Pofan Lai had a [romance] with Gary Cooper, and also had a temporary affair with John Gilbert. Afterwards, she went to the Ziegfeld Follies. After returning to Hollywood, there were rumors of a love affair with Weissmuller, the male lead of [Tarzan the Ape Man], but she is still an unmarried girl. Now she has adopted a daughter named Joan, who is the daughter of her sister and is already four years old. Among the stars in Hollywood, unmarried girls (Bachelor Girls) becoming mothers, she and Miriam Hopkins are the founders.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Movie Stars' Enthusiasm for Snow</h3>
<p>When it snows in Hollywood in winter, many stars gather together, put on short clothes, and go to the silver world to hold various activities. Except for a few older people who cannot muster the enthusiasm, no one is willing to hide at home and give up this good opportunity that only comes a few days a year, especially the young stars, who jump and frolic in the snowflakes like puppies happy to see snow.</p>
<p>The most enthusiastic about playing in the snow is Warner Company's Marian Marsh. When winter comes, she prepares a unique set of clothes in advance to wear when playing in the snow. The top is a black short outfit, the trousers are made of blue wool, and she wears a dark red coat on the outside, with extremely large pockets and a blood-ivory scarf. When it snows, she wears this outfit and is the first to climb up the mountain. You can recognize her from afar.</p>
<p>Ben Lyon and Sally Eilers, whenever it snows, go together to [Snow City], which is a hundred miles away from Hollywood, to play the game of stepping on snow with two bamboo poles supporting their feet and two wooden boards, because the snow there is the thickest. Fusi Company actress June Vlasek likes to gather a few friends on snowy days and twist snow into snowballs, as if throwing bombs, to play snow fights.</p>
<p>Mae Madison, Polly Walters, and Ruth Hall are the most skilled in playing in the snow. When it snows heavily, the three of them go together to San Bernardino Mountain, put on skates, and slide straight down from the top of the mountain. Mae Madison is from California, and Polly Walters is from Warsaw, both in the north, so they are proficient in this. However, Ruth Hall is from Florida, which is in the south, where it rarely snows. She learned her skills by practicing with Mae Madison and Polly.</p>
<h3>The Match King's Exploits (10)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi Meng</p>
<p>She had just entered the garden when a person emerged from the shadows. [I have been waiting for you for a long time,] Paul Kreuger said awkwardly.</p>
<p>[You?] she asked, seemingly disbelieving. At that moment, the sound of the violin became even clearer and more beautiful. [You did this?]</p>
<p>[This is especially for you,] Paul said earnestly. She sat down in the arbor and pointed to a seat beside her, asking him to sit next to her. [No one—never—has ever done anything so sweet for me,] she said, trembling slightly. The moonlit night was filled with musical enchantment. [For a long time, I have not been so happy, and there is one thing that can drive me crazy, and that is Peri Winkles.]</p>
<p>Paul's hand stealthily touched her hand, and she did not pull her hand away.</p>
<p>[What are Peri Winkles?] he asked. [Are they stars in the sky? Or a beautiful flower?] He seemed to mean that her shimmering eyes were as bright as stars in the sky; her lotus-like face was like a fresh flower.</p>
<p>[That is a kind of sea snail produced near my hometown, the North Sea. I have loved that kind of thing since I was a child.] She told Paul, unconsciously moving her delicate body closer and closer to Paul. They leaned against each other, listening to the music.</p>
<p>In the office in Stockholm, Eric sat behind Paul's desk, his face very haggard, his movements awkward and uneasy, and there were many noisy voices, seemingly arguing with Eric.</p>
<p>[What about the loan from Barclays Bank? Our credit is about to be lost. Mr. Kreuger should know...]</p>
<p>[The lease contract for the Copenhagen factory expires tomorrow...]</p>
<p>[The customs at the port of Danzig are not allowing unloading...]</p>
<p>[Romania is now full of Soviet products, which is in conflict with us...]</p>
<p>[The Taksas phosphorus factory refuses to deliver...]</p>
<p>[What should we do about Brazil?...]</p>
<p>[A long-distance call from New York is asking for Mr. Kreuger...]</p>
<p>[What about the one million two hundred thousand feet of cedar?...]</p>
<p>[What about this loan from Barclays Bank?...]</p>
<p>A clerk ran in, walked to Eric's side, and handed him a telegram.</p>
<p>Eric immediately stood up, seemingly very excited, and raised his hand, [We have contacted Mr. Kreuger. He is now in Salzburg, and I will be connecting with him immediately.] (To be continued)</p>
