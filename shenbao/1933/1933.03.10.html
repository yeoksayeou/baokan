<p>當熱河告急之初。吾人曾籲請蔣軍委員長暫委其勦匪責任於他將領。尅日命駕北上。藉以激厲士氣。并昭示政府抵抗之决心。乃不旋踵而熱河天險。即告陷落。華北屏障。從此盡撤。吾人環顧破碎之山河。瞻望艱難之前路。正在嘔心泣血莫可如何之際。而蔣委員長以北上聞。</p>
<p>蔣委員長於此全國人民屬望之時。毅然北上。其爲收拾華北局面乎。抑爲計劃抗暴禦侮乎。以我人料之。非對外能圑結一致以抗暴。則華北局面。决無法以謀收拾。故蔣委員長之北上。非徒爲收拾華北可知。自九一八以來。舉國人民。切齒悲憤。忍痛屏息。以期待失地之收復。然而遼吉黑三省失陷之後。錦州榆關。又次第爲日軍魔掌所攫去。今熱河又告淪亡。彼手握大軍安坐北平驕奢淫逸之張學良。國人固早覺其不足恃。亦早覺其不足責。而政府之遲徊審顧。不能當機立斷。亦不能不分任其責。今惟有希望我政府。振紀綱而奮威信。一方嚴懲誤國者以應得之罪。一方整飭國軍。以收復失地。報載上海各公圑之電曰。［吾民衆與政府。須知熱河之失。非兵士之不肯戰。非一般將領之不敢戰。其咎惟身負指揮全責之高級將領尸之。一方固痛恨未喪師先失地之罪在不赦。一方正應念及將士一心軍民合力之尚可有爲。苟國有常刑。則士皆朝氣。吾民衆仍當羣策羣力。始終合作。以圖補救桑榆於萬一］。斯言也。誠蔣委員長所宜深思者也。</p>
<p>今日全國人民。固無一不東望暴日。敵愾同仇也。政府果能堅决與暴日抗爭。則全國人民。無一不願從政府之後。踴躍以共赴國難。觀夫國人從前對馬占山所部義勇軍及滬戰抗日將士之熱烈愛護。踴躍捐輸。即可徵今日我人民。决非願作亡國之人民。而盼望蔣委員長者深也。土耳其於一九一八歐戰慘敗之後。政治旣失重心。全國呈分崩瓦離之局。而鼓吹大希臘主義之希軍。復乘土耳其之危。大舉進攻。於一九一九年佔領士麥那。然而基瑪爾將軍。一旦崛起於東部小亞細亞。率訓練未久軍械不備之國民軍。與希軍堅决抗爭。終克以三年之苦鬭。驅希軍於境外。奠定新土耳其之基石。苟蔣委員長今日而能領導我全國人民。堅决反抗日本之侵略。則即爲我國之基瑪爾也。蔣委員長乎。國人所期望者深矣切矣。其將何以慰國人之期望乎。</p>
<p>塞外　鼓。動地而來。燕冀風雲。又在眉睫。吾人料想蔣委員長此行所感受寇人之深國家之危而决然奮起。必有甚於吾人者。近在鄭州。曾對各記者表示。［中正當向北邁進。誓爲國人前驅。以報黨國］壯哉斯言。果如是者。我全國人民當無不仰望旂旗。一致奮起。爲國效命。以從蔣委員長之後。</p>

<h3 id="c69">日人目中之美海軍大演習之戰略意義（伊藤正德） <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>一大演習起因</p>
<p>太平洋兩岸的氣壓已經了常態了、目前雖然還未達到［暴風雨］的程度、但烈風仍正繼續鼓蕩着兩岸上國民間的感情正當此時、美國海軍大演習開始了、這是否爲對日備戰呢、一般人都懷着這樣的疑念、對停泊在太平洋中的大西洋艦隊、感受到一種剌激、而另一方面、我國（日本）本年度的海軍大演習、也將範圍擴大、這擴大的消息、竟被認作對國聯備戰和對美示威、於是對岸的人、也感受到一種剌激了、</p>
<p>形式上彼此是互相疑惑着、因爲演習的對峙是事實、而這事實、就是引起疑問的對象、本來、艦隊藉着演習、彼此聯歡、是正當的、由此而互相疑忌、未免太爲荒謬、聯歡是象徵着和平、而疑忌則是備戰的基因、不遇人類雖然愛好和平、但當前情形、則似已在無意中倾向到戰備方面去、這就是日美二國關係上的一種現實、以下就是國際間政情的反映、如在滿洲及上海事變中、美國疑惑日本要占領中國、史汀生的外交、即根據此疑惑作出發點、因之日本也便深疑美國對日備戰、國際間的論調、也即隨着緊張起來、而美國之疑忌、又愈以加深、這樣往復的疑忌、就是現在太平洋兩岸的實相、等到這種無意識的空氣剛　沉靜下去、而日美兩國的大演習、又先後舉行、這自然不啻在灰燼尚未冷息之前、加了一些猜疑的薪柴、究意美國海軍演習、值不值得警戒呢、究竟日本的海軍演習、值不值得猜疑呢、</p>
<p>二戰略及兵術</p>
<p>無知常能引起误解、誤解又往往能引起戰爭、無意識的判斷國際間的事情、或者半通半不通的評論、這類的問題、都常是含有危險性的兩國國民對於日美海軍關係上的誤解、至少在軍備競爭的事實上、將會引出危險來、</p>
<p>如果美國演習的目的是顯然對日備戰、那麽我們也自然非得確實的準備一下事可、如果日本的演習是眞的對·····的一種假想作戰、那麽美國的猜疑、亦自爲不所當然、如果日本的演習是因爲預定脱離國聯、預定拒絶交還······、預定聯盟軍以實力來爭奪的時候、日本孤軍應戰而舉行的話那麽、猜疑還多少是有些理由、但是日本海軍將領、事實上在目前、還不會想到和世界作戰的問題上去、所以目前尚不至有如上所述的演習、不過、我們對於美國海軍演習的視角、應該是鋭或是鈍呢、自然、無論爲鋭爲鈍片面的觀察、决不會看出其表裏、所以在此、作者先買獻兩個槪念、即</p>
<p>（一）美國海軍大演習之政治上的意義　　（二）其戰術的意義、</p>
<p>以上二點、是觀察水平面得來的、如果再</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>深一層看下去的話、同樣也可得到二個槪念、即</p>
<p>（Ａ）美海軍演習現有勢力之試　及戰略的表示</p>
<p>（Ｂ）對於將來之要求、</p>
<p>三大演習</p>
<p>此次演習期限、自一月二十三日偵察部隊丨大西洋艦隊（scoutingforce,us.fleet）、由加州桑皮多　拔　日起至三月三十一日、美國艦隊全體聯合戰術演習終了日止、約七十日、但偵察部隊及戰　部隊（ＢlttleＦorce）、於一月一日、在根據地即已開始準備、故由一月一日算起、也可説是九十日、參加者差不多是美國海軍全部、演習分爲三段、</p>
<p>演習目的　　　　期間　　　　參加軍</p>
<p>第一期布哇攻守演習　自一月二十三日　　攻丨偵察部隊</p>
<p>（ＪointＥercise）至二月五日守丨布哇陸海軍</p>
<p>第二期占領根據地演習自二月六日　　　　攻丨偵察部隊</p>
<p>（ＦleetＰroblem）至二月十七日守丨戰　部隊</p>
<p>第三期大艦隊聯合訓練自二月十八日美國全體艦隊</p>
<p>（ＦleetＣoncentration）至三月三十一日</p>
<p>由上表觀之、演習的攻守戰地、均爲島　及根據地、此與專在海面以大砲魚雷等射擊戰術爲主之普通演習相比、不僅樣式較多、且亦很有趣味、下文當爲詳述、此種演習方式、對於空軍、有極重要的戰術意義、不獨世界各國海軍當局、即關心海軍的人們、也當嚴重注視</p>
<p>此種戰術的教訓如何、到四月裏便可看到他的記錄、然而比較有味的幾種戰術、現在也能猜想出來一點、例如一般所傳主砲用［着色水柱］測騐各艦的相互距離、在第三期演習裏、也可算是有興味的事了、此外如主砲在夜戰時發射［遠隔照明彈］以窺敵艦、并遮護自己而擊敵軍的一種新戰術、亦饒有興味、而布哇攻守之戰、又即爲上海戰的一個反映與寫實、興味當更爲濃厚、上列諸點、當在下文討論、茲先研究所謂政治上的戰略上的諸意義、</p>
<p>四攻勢及守勢的測騐</p>
<p>一般人對於此次的演習的疑問、第一就是攻勢或守勢的問題、我所説的［政治上的意義、］大體就是指着這點、所謂政治意義、就是指着戰略而言、平時演習的戰略、極能映出政治上或外交上的行動來、因爲戰略是國家政策的一體、政策向左戰略向右、不但爲理論所不許、實際上也是拙笨而無益的、所以由海軍大演習所採的方式裏可以測騐出政策的方向及外交的趨向、已到某種程度</p>
<p>當然演習的目標是無定的、也不能每年每次在同一海面用同一兵力作假想戰的、戰式雖僅大同小異、戰略背景、絶不是一樣、假定每年變更戰略、是演習上當然應該的事、給與假想敵國的影響、也絶不是一樣的、换言之、主觀的出於無心的戰略、在客觀上却會被認作有意的戰略目標、</p>
<p>但是這種微妙的心理、因爲時局背景不同、有時激昂、但有時也會沉靜、所以對於演習目的之攻守問題的觀測、及判斷其國家政策之動向、自然是視時局的發展如何而轉移的、所以日美的關係、在史汀生將外交方針修正之後、漸漸的緩和下來、和去年此時相比、其冷熱程度、已不可同日而語、國民感情、也弛懈了許多、但是雙方的疑雲、仍是籠罩着、還未到雨過天青的地步、對於美國大演習的詳論、　欲一聞爲快的民衆的增多、便可證明人心仍在浮蕩着、</p>
<p>其實、如前次在巴拿馬一帶演習攻守戰略時一樣地拿日本當作假想敵國、並假定運河遭了日本空軍的爆炸、因此美國主力艦隊及巡洋艦隊、首尾不得相顧、致陷於孤軍無援的狀態等、他們這種演習、確是覺得有味、但在日本則不得不注視此次的演習、以揣測局勢的緩急、</p>
<p>五守勢的猜測</p>
<p>先就此次的演習冷靜地觀察、我們似乎覺得美國的演習是守勢、第一、假定布哇已被敵人占領、美國海軍從布哇起始進攻、這種戰略是多麽的表示消極、第二、反攻布哇的軍艦不用主力艦隊而用巡洋艦隊、和從前演習時相比、也是消極的表示、第三、第二期演習内專以防守本國根據地爲目的、這就是守勢的表現、第四、根據地的防禦軍爲主力戰艦隊、更是顯明的［守勢］的表現了、</p>
<p>原來攻和守就像楯的兩面、不能分别的、欲守必攻、欲攻亦必守、所以攻守二字、除在觀念上可以分别外、在戰略上是不可隔斷的、名將　罕曾説、一戰略雖然是取守勢、艦隊亦須常取攻勢</p>
<p>如果將這兩句話從裏面觀察、則有時艦隊取攻勢作戰、而戰略却是取守勢、但演習是平時戰略平時戰術的表現、現在如果照以上所説的演習目的看去、則我們不妨説美國平時觀略及戰術是守勢的、這種戰略、正和美國歷來的傳統政策相左、即對日美關係避却刺激性的表現而從深遠的意識方面去考慮、我們知道美國軍隊正在加緊的練習自由攻擊、但此種游擊式的自由攻擊用以警戒敵人則有餘、用以正式作戰却嫌不足也、</p>
<p>作者對美國的海軍演習是抱着好的感想的、除開史汀生國務卿、作者對普拉提督也是尊敬的、我尊敬他的智慧及高明、如果史汀生想對日本開戰是事實、則普拉的阻止便是更大的事實、一九三二年的大演習、一切規模都是普拉提督構想的寫實</p>
<p>六日美之海軍均勢</p>
<p>史汀生起初還有點理解日本、錦州事件以後、便轉變心理、憎日情感益深、終於提出了［可否對日作戰的疑問］而立刻答之以［否］的、就是普拉提督、</p>
<p>對於所謂情况的判斷丨丨近來美國海軍非常重視的戰略要素、ＥstimationofＳituation丨丨普拉已經凌駕於美國政治家之上了、提督曾言無論是戰略上、或兵量上、日美兩國的海戰皆有不利、至少是無益的、現在想極力避去戰爭、而在戰爭之外、發現出海軍的價值、</p>
<p>此次演習的規模和目的、差不多和以上所述一樣、而對攻守各軍的佈置及選擇、處處使人一看便知出於［守勢］、或者有人會疑惑這是緩和日本的一種烟幕、疑惑的只好由他去疑惑、作者却是極端相信的、只是另有一事我們却不能不知道、日本海軍因爲保有現在的實力、所以能夠存在、假如日本海軍的實力比現在少去一半的話、或者日美戰爭老早就展開了、並且日本的遠東政策説不定要受牽制和壓迫、日本不等到戰爭開始、説不定老早就屈服了、</p>
<p>美國人自然不會爲遠東問題而流血的、但對史汀生的發問、如果普拉提督答之以［可操勝算］的話（日美實力比率爲四比十）那麽事實上不是日美戰爭、便就是日本屈服、</p>
<p>美國的現在勢力、以之防守本國則有餘、以之攻擊日本則不足、現在日本海軍的實力對於任何一國之進攻足夠敵抗之用、换言之、就美攻日守地位而言、日美海軍亦勢均力敵、彼此不能侵犯、軍備的精髓及其價值就都在這裏、</p>
<p>日本若没有這種實力、自然也難以承認滿洲國、也不能以擁護遠東和平的主人翁自居了、惟其有這種勢力、綫保持了日美的和平、軍人或者願意一戰的、然而我們國民已經公認海軍不戰而獲的價值了、美國的演習也被認之爲守勢、於斯國交上的氣壓也漸漸的平靜下去了、</p>

<p>在泰岱山下發現</p>
<p>爲空前未有奇寳</p>
<p>泰安通信、山東泰山爲五嶽之尊、歷代帝王、無不封禪致祭、其所用一切金石祭器、皆與中國歷史文化上有重大關係、惟用後多嚴密珍藏、以示尊崇泰山之意、自唐代以來、此項祭品、迄無發見、最近泰安忽有發現唐明皇致祭泰山所用玉簡祭文玉器之事實傳出、據聞當發現時、泰安正爲某軍所駐防、故悉爲某軍所得、其後某軍旣開拔離魯、寳藏亦運往北平茲特調查其情形如次、</p>
<p>寳藏之所在泰山之下、津浦路泰安車站以北、有一小山名曰嵩里山、山上有閻王廟、廟前有一塔、其建築年月、無可籍考、但知爲唐代而已、十七年革命軍北伐之役、山上之廟及塔、均爲軍火所摧毁、及某軍駐防泰安、乃派兵掃除山上殘磚破瓦、並另在該塔原址、另築一紀念碑、今巍然　立、乘津浦車路過該地十數里外、即可望見、不知者固不料此塔之下、曾有珍貴之寳藏發現也、</p>
<p>發現之經過當某軍掃除該塔時因擬改建紀念碑、乃先掘除塔根之殘磚、不意塔底之下忽發現五色土與北平天地壇形式相同土、成一方形、四週爲赤白青黑四色、中爲黃色、（如圖）</p>
<p>白　　掘土兵士、見其土</p>
<p>赤黃黑　質特别、即報告其</p>
<p>青　　最高長官、長官聞</p>
<p>報、知其下必有寳</p>
<p>藏、乃令向下挖掘、</p>
<p>並每日更换一兵、以免消息外露、當在赤白青黑各色土内掘獲大批玉器、考其字跡、皆唐朝明皇（玄宗）封禪泰山所用之祭品也、</p>
<p>精美之玉簡後又在黃色土中、掘獲得五尺見方之石盒、盒外雕刻、極爲細緻、開啓石盒、復有一金盒在内、金盒刻花、尤爲奥妙、非筆墨所可形容、金盒之内、有白玉版十五塊、平排於内、每版長約一尺、寛在二寸左右、皆以金絲穿連、每版之上、皆刻隸字形體、與唐明皇所置泰山銘相同、聯讀十五版上之文、則唐明皇封禪泰山之祭文也、祭文詞句、尤爲雋妙、於是遂證明係唐明皇封禪泰山後埋藏之祭品、某軍着領乃嚴守秘密、收而藏之、今則該軍開拔離魯已久、此項古物、早已運往北平、有當時掘土之兵士未隨該軍開拔者、頃談及此事、外間乃行得知其詳、</p>
<p>（古物之價值）據在泰安之考古家談、此項古器、爲空前未有之發現、金盒内雕刻祭文之版、即古玉簡也、近代雖知有玉簡之名、而無人得見、其重要處、一方面可以考量古代封禪泰山典禮儀式、一方面可見古代書簡之形象、與我國歷史文化、極有關係、其價值遠在過去發現任何古物之上云、（三月七日）</p>

<h3 id="c74">今日起實行洋本位 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>錢業决議辦法通告會員</p>
<p>外滙從此改用銀元折合·</p>
<p>兩元兌换處卽開始辦公</p>
<p>則政部决定今日起實行改爲洋本位、各業交易、改用銀幣計算、規定七錢一分五厘爲法定價格、錢業、前日開臨時大會、議决辦法、銀行業國外滙兌、改以銀幣計算、中央等三銀行合組之兌换機關、今日上午九時起、開始辦公、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>（錢業公告辦法）</p>
<p>錢業同業公會、昨通告各會員云、逕啓者、案查本月八日、爲銀洋並用事、開臨時會員代表大會、討論三月十日起各事項、經全體决議如下、（甲）關於對内者、（一）市塲早午二市、照常聚集、（二）厘價照法定價格、作七錢一分五厘、（三）銀拆應改爲拆息、銀洋一律以轉帳計息、（四）銀行銀圓劃頭、一律以分角計算、（五）同業所多銀洋兩項、每晚均須收現、如願拆願借者、不在此例（六）當日如銀圓匯頭過剩、不能供求軋平者、暫由本準備庫買賣之惟當晚均須解現、所解成箱現銀圓、均須照例封箱、至遲以十二時爲限、（乙）關於對外者、（一）本埠各業及本埠銀行、並外埠同行、如來票類、均照向章銀票力一樣辦理、（二）外埠同業、如來鈔票或現銀圓、每千圓應算手續費一角、（三）凡各往來家、原有票貼者、仍照向章辦理、上列各項、均經决議紀錄在卷、相應錄案通告務請　照辦理、爲荷、此請公鑒、</p>
<p>（銀行改革辦法）</p>
<p>銀行業經理國外匯兌者、</p>
<p>如美金·法郎·日金·港洋·羅比·新洋·馬克·荷盾·英鎊·等、原均以銀兩計算、决定於今日起、以法定價七錢一分五厘、折合率、改用銀幣計算、銀行業同業公會組織之行市委員會、定今日起停止發電、報告洋厘行市各地匯欵、照　辦法、因匯水上下不定、均視當地市面之需要决定、但中央銀行之外匯、早已實行以銀幣折合</p>
<p>（開始兌换兩元）</p>
<p>中央中國交通等三銀行合組之一上海銀圓銀兩兌换管理委員會、自經三行指定中央唐　民·李覺·席德懋·中國貝淞孫·史久　·交通秦祖澤·陳濬等七人爲委員後、組織大綱、已經財部頒布、辦事細則、已議定通過、定今日起開始辦公、兌换處設在中央銀行樓下業務局出納科、辦公處在中央銀行三樓、秘書由中央銀行發行局副發行楊曉波兼任調派辦事員四名、專任兌换職務、凡以銀兩兌换銀元、或以银元兌换銀兩者、均須塡具請求書、俟核發准兌通知書、再向指定銀行兌换、辦公時間、上午九時至下午五時、惟請求書須於每日午後二時前送達當日午後三時、發給准兌通知書、</p>
<p>（市府通令遵照）</p>
<p>市政府准財部咨、昨通令實行洋本位云、爲令行事、案准財政部錢字第五九八八號咨開、爲咨行事、本部爲準備廢兩、先從上海實施、特規定上海市面通用銀兩與銀本位幣一元、或舊有一元銀幣之合原定重量成色者、以規元七錢一分五厘、合銀幣一元爲一定之换算率、自本年三月十日施行由本部公布在案、所有公私欵項之收付、債權債務之清算以及一切交易各種税收、均應按照前項定率、折合銀幣收付、以昭劃一、除呈請行政院轉呈國民政府備案、并分别咨行外相應咨請貴市政府查照、并轉飭所屬一體遵照等由、准此、除分令外、合行令仰、即便遵照、此令、</p>
<p>（折合以洋計算）</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨晤銀錢業領袖、據談、實行改爲洋本位後各往來户之欵項、以銀兩計算者、均照舊、凡各往來户如需要銀兩票子仍可照開、至於各業洋行出貨、及各項繳費、向用銀兩者、均可以法定價格、改用銀幣付給、因以前收銀兩者、往往擅自增减洋厘行市、以圖折合上之利益、今銀兩價格旣有規定、且已廢止洋厘、故可無問題矣、</p>
<p>（廠條代替元寳）</p>
<p>中央造幣廠、自三月一日鼓鑄新幣後、銀元寳勢歸淘汰、聞造幣廠决計發行廠條、配好重量成色、每條計一千元、代替元寳之用將來銀錢業庫存、均改爲廠條、現本市元寳存數、約二萬三千萬兩左右、</p>

<p>提議召集臨時國民大會</p>
<p>决定整個對日大政方針</p>
<p>最近熱河失陷、平津告急、各方言論文電、側重巖懲張湯獨九四老人馬相伯先生高瞻遠　、見解不與人同、據其昨對新聲社記者云、余嘗與章太炎先生聯名宣言、痛斥日人侵略熱河之非、今此六十萬方里之國土、</p>
<p>竟爲日人所佔領矣老夫得訊、恍聞春雷、欲哭無涙、抑鬱至今、今承訪問、願吐所懷、皇姑屯之慘案、實日人之暴行、張學良不報父仇更何有於愛國保種耶、夫報私仇、本非宗教家所願齒及然張學良之父、係華北當時長官、而其遺職、則由張學良自承襲之、國之地方長官、非敵軍可隨意剌殺者、故張學良之應報父仇實爲人道國法應有之行動、今竟始終坐擁大軍、苟安旦夕、誠如某君所咏打油詩所云、［聽説日攻馬占山、日軍未入山海關、山海關内還有關、關内不如閨内歡、大有此間樂不思蜀矣］之神情、故目前張學良非撤懲或辭職、可以了此滔天大禍之公案、</p>
<p>實應激發天良誓復父仇、收復東北、然後可希望自贖前愆、尚不愧爲一血性好男兒、否則難逃天理國法之裁判、至於湯玉麟正目前所謂軍　本色、對内肆抽重税、迫種鴉片等苛政手段、對外則聞風逃命、不戰而走、類此者滔滔皆是、惟其不肯投降日人、較東北舊軍閥之傀儡登塲、尚差勝籌耳、抑目前之問題决非湯張等個人責任問題、實我</p>
<p>全民禦侮救國問題、猶憶明賢史可法有言、［北都之變、凡屬臣子、皆有罪、在北者應從死、豈在南者非人臣、夫將所以能克敵者、氣也、君所以能御將者、志也、廟堂志不奮、則行　氣不鼓、在南諸臣、死節者無多、在北諸臣、討　者復少、此千古之恥也、］老夫之引稱史公　言、非故意過甚其詞、唤醒全民之責任心、實因目前之危機四伏、平津旣難保守、故所謂古物明令南運、北平國立大學又議遷地爲良、華北旣不鞏固、長江敵艦、密佈沿岸商埠、旦起　、則首都又告急矣、且日人所謂水上生命線、遠至南洋、其海軍可隨時侵犯我華南各埠、故大局如此、我全民唯有擁護國家、整個禦宼、誠以暴宼傾全國之師以犯我、我</p>
<p>祇以局部抵抗决不爲功、所惜目前國是、極其撲朔迷離、不觀外宼大舉犯境、有如盜旣升堂入室、一家兄弟、尚不自愛、如四川貴州等處内亂、必待盜以刀刃如每一人之　、始戰獨肯自衛、當然已措手不及、淞滬之役、最近熱河之事、皆係敵先動手、而我還擊、且必待敵佈防妥後、而我始分頭應戰、且不戰而逃走、</p>
<p>眞是豈有此理同時暴宼則自由派遣海陸空軍、得隴望蜀、得寸進尺、今又宣言將取察哈爾矣、不知現在該地夙唱抗日之馮玉祥將軍、亦正積極聯合氏衆準備禦宼否、且我國最近召回駐日公使、而日本外交官、則在我國大活躍、遍竭中外重要人物游説、實行一種［口甜而心毒］的外交政策、又在各大都市設情報局、公開作國家軍事密探、至對我　民一入日本境、時遭非法拘禁或監視者、幾日有　聞、在如此畸形怪現像之下、無怪我出席國聯代表、曾聯名辭職、未識自九一八慘案至今、我國</p>
<p>對日大政方針究竟如何、國危如斯、將欲對日、政府急需全民之擁護、老夫主張立即召集國民大會、政府與全民統籌國是、國民大會必要理由、採何方式、略申言之、憶普法戰爭、法國被侵略、極危急時期、有［爹爺］者出、提議召集國民大會、始奠定其時之危局、我國國難、今亦略何、故召集全民之代表、出席代表、最好由各縣人民自治圑體公推之舉行此種國民大會之目的、在將國是重要問題、</p>
<p>付之國民公决（一）對日和戰問題、今日之局面、我不戰不和、而暴宼則實行蠶食政策、今日取一城、明日清一鄉、使不戰官吏、望風逃走、人民義勇軍失根據地、同時我旣不宣告絶交、又聲明不簽訂和約、坐失時機、復喪國土、故全民總意、必須予以公决之機會、如前次國難會議、僅所謂諮詢機關、所議决之重要者、如一致禦侮各案件、皆備案存查之類耳惟此種國民大會之議决案、我國民政府必須執行、庶使今後是國定於一矣、（二）統籌國防問題、全國軍政必須統一爲國防計、祗需效忠全國及國府者、雖獨裁制亦可無妨、必須運用全體民意、打破目前割　局面、全體軍事領袖、率軍　還國家、俾國軍悉用爲國防、至私人稱兵招兵、從事内亂者、國民公判、罪在不赦、（三）統籌財政問題、因對外禦侮、必需大經費、國民公决、或借外債、或發公債、使禦侮將士、源源有接濟、不必再行零星募捐、因杯水車薪、殊難有濟耳、其他修明内政等待决事件、皆以國民公意决之、總之、今後救國之途徑、祗有［全民禦侮］之一法、民國復興、實賴此舉、</p>

<p>救出嘉興黨山灣農民家綁來肉票</p>
<p>昨法捕房破獲嘉興來滬之大帮太湖綁匪、當塲救出自嘉興綁來肉票一口、先後共獲男女綁匪十一名、詳請分述於次、</p>
<p>（農家生活）</p>
<p>嘉興南門外黨山灣地方、有農民陳天友者、年四十八歲、家道小康、娶妻倪氏、僅有一子一女、長女已字人、子名祖榮（乳名阿毛）現年十四歳、天性聰慧而容貌端莊、不　農家子弟、故老夫婦愛如掌上珠、七歳時即就讀於本鄉私熟、　家融融如也、度其農村生活、不料竟禍生肘腋、</p>
<p>（太湖綁匪）</p>
<p>陳因家道小康故、久爲匪徒所注意、詎至本年舊歷正月中旬薄暮之際、突來太湖大帮綁匪十餘名、先將陳之財物刦掠一空、然後將陳之愛子祖榮擄架而去、事後匪等將肉票由水道轉來滬、藏匿於法租界薛華立路一五五號弄平安坊三號匪窟、</p>
<p>（來滬談判</p>
<p>陳自失愛子後、如疾如狂、未幾即接到匪方來函、勒贖四千元之鉅欵、迭次接洽、因爲數相差太遠、無法接近、最近又去一函約陳來滬、註明於昨日上午八時左右、在法租界菜市街寳裕里口接洽陳接信後、當即派人來滬、判談一切、</p>
<p>（匪慾望奢）</p>
<p>陳之代表來滬後、深知匪之慾望太奢、恐終鮮美滿結果、遂毅然托人密報法　　捕房督察長金九林、遂於昨晨八時許金督察長通知西探長亨利、立即親自率同探目張子楹·周耀庭·周秉澄·秦有裕·包探蔡錦章·馬益之·張春勝·徐桂林·等、分别化裝、暗帶武器、先在寳裕里口預伏</p>
<p>（最低贖價）</p>
<p>先是陳之代表按照匪方來函、做成標記、竚立寳裕里口等候、八時許果見一人、向其招呼、然後將其導至該里滬海旅社四號房内密談、此時衆探乃一擁而入、當塲獲住兩匪、並在匪首沈玉雲袴擋内抄獲致陳之勒贖信一封、封面寫明面交［陳天友先生收］、發信人署名［沈傳鋆］、内容處詞以三千五百元爲最低贖價、</p>
<p>（肉票出險）</p>
<p>兩匪就逮後、旋又在菜市街西新橋街口昌興大旅社卅二號房間續獲三人、供出肉票藏匿所在、即按址將票救出、最後又在馬浪路華東公庽十二號房間截獲三男一女、又在福履理路獲一男一女、計前後共獲十一名之多、均經捕頭嚴詰一過、諭令分别收押、候解法院嚴究、截至記者發稿時、捕房尚繼續偵緝中、</p>

<p>各地海關訪尋無着</p>
<p>傳在瓊州附近沉没</p>
<p>新聲社云、通裕航業公司代理輪船裕隆號、於去年十二月八日、由紅基裝煤起椗來滬、突然失踪、經公司懸賞訪尋、毫無着落、茲據確訊、該輪開出後、已在海南島附近遇颶風沉没、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>（遍訪無着）</p>
<p>裕隆輪失踪後、即由各地海關用無線電訪尋無着、船員家屬、驚惶異常、紛向公司請求救濟、公司雖懸重賞、但仍毫無消息、當派該輪大副之弟等三人、赴香港沿路查訪、公司昨得由香港來電報告、亦稱無法訪尋、據公司人員談、裕隆輪依各方之預測、必已失事沉没矣、如爲盜刦、决不致迄今仍無消息、而航業界、均認爲已遇颶風沉没云、</p>

<p>丨本埠朱　英女　來信丨</p>
<p>編者先生··我是一個處居舊家庭内含有新思想的反被　迫的伶仃弱女。我的年紀已十八歳，受過相當的嚴格教育，對於社會新的智　，認得很清楚。因我的父親是一　産階級的大商店内　手，每年進益亦可觀。他　脾氣很和善，不過思想固執點。我是他元配所生的。嗣後没有生過，雖我母勸其納妾，總是不肯。因此　愛我如掌上珠。　歳時，送入小　　　。因學堂份尚有緣，也經過升入初中二年級，現在已輟學了。不幸慈母大人因肺癆病一年前　世了。當時很痛苦。大槪［　死做官爹，莫忘討飯　！不過我的婚姻問題，早　解决。是慈母作主的。乃　　家。從此父親因後嗣的關係，就　娶了一位年華貌美的少女　　婦。我亦樂於歡迎的。從後母娶進之初，尚好，漸漸地脾氣性格，簡直好比换了一個人。對我的待遇，亦不對了。事也凑巧，離我母校附近，卽某大學某學生，常從我母校經過，且是　　的少年，　　後，因　問方面很投機，好像怨若相見之晚，從此星期日互約公園電影院之游，久而成爲積不解緣的發生戀愛，而至内體。感春風數　，珠胎已結　互訂　頭之約，雙方預約實行婚姻革命。彼的婚姻，亦父母作主，定某女　，他爲了我　在向　父進行了。　是後母有一位内姪，乃一時　少年，常走我家，當主人的我，略具應酬的　　，然而我後母常將言語　　，如何自由　愛，如何男女平　，如何姪子有出息等言語　當初　恨他是　　，　不料他　　　將我許配給他的姪子　因爲已有了情的人，當然正言厲色的拒絶。他　勸了從此竟見各殊，並目信口　黃的告枕　狀。　的父聽信　言，就早　夜打的苛待我。從此亦　　了。幸得同某。生的關係，未被後母曉得，雙方情書，常常　來的。有一次被後母接去了，將信交給父看，受一次皮肉痛苦。肚内的東西，還未曉得。冤家式的未婚夫，要　結婚的信，寫給我，拆開後當然羞辱地的不答　。隔了一星期。父同後母談起備嫁的手續，聽到這種　人的消息，令人欲哭無涙。在此千鈞一髮的當兒，　不出辦法，一方迎娶的日子將迫，一方珠胎漸　，並且要出　了。提出離婚，對方乃一紳士，並且父母又不同意，仍照原婚，旣害了某學生，又有身孕的秘密，打胎旣有生命危險，又在父母制裁之下　左右爲難。惟有自殺，以了素愿。上述的　　皆受法律牽制。我乃一弱女子，没有見　的。火燒眉睫，請先生將良好的辦法，以現法律無牽制的妥善方法，俾可　　。幸我家庭　亦觀貴報，每天所見的讀者顧問困難問題，皆受先生妥善的指教，有益於　者多矣。對於回信問題，因我後母　　，和名譽問題，頂好在報端披露，否者恐要弄僵的。</p>
<p>答，女士的問題在現在社會的家庭，禮教的拘束之下，實在没有萬全的方法，無已祇有，（一）女士馬上稱病住到醫院去，並堅决地拒絶結婚，這要下决心去奮鬭的。（二）要求你的愛人某大學生同時寫信去家堅决地退婚，並聲明在上海已自由與女士訂婚，要求家中承認。若果某大學生有這種勇氣與决心，那事情就好辦。無論如何，兩相情願的戀愛，法律上是不會有什麽强力的干涉的。至多不過你的父親　你繼母的話將你逐出，那祇要你的愛人不抛棄你，你俩索性同居起來，待你分娩後，設法找點工作，慢慢向前過活。所困難的，是你們更事太少，不知防止生育，竟然弄出　個第三者出來，你們的將來恐怕歡娱日少苦日多丨而且上海的大學生，我們不敢説没有好的，然而眞正温柔　厚，不做負心的人，恐怕是不可多得，這必要看女士自己對他的觀察如何了丨</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>對外很客氣；對内戰爭不息。蕭伯訥的幽默評論，現在又應騐了。老湯，是一個對外很客氣的，敵兵未到，他已［前客讓後客］了。全國的民衆憤激之下，都把老湯駡個無休無歇；老湯怕你們駡麽？他若怕駡，也不會把脚底給你們看了。你們已上了他這麽一回大當，還要動着肝火去駡他，豈不惹他笑掉了下　麽？昔日陳琳檄吳將的一篇文字，有一句：［名字不足以污簡　］，我們怕污簡墨，當然不用去駡他了。凡是駡人，須含有一種激發那　駡者天良的作用，倘似老湯，還可以駡動他的天良麽？所以我們對於這位宣言［抗日到底］的湯玉麟主席，只有頌揚，没有唾駡；頌揚他什麽？頌揚他肯聽幽默老頭子的話，實行其對外大客氣。</p>
<p>我們不駡老湯，倒要駡我們自己；對於老湯信誓旦旦的宣言，太看重了；對於老湯努力抵抗的戰報，太相信了；結果吃了老湯的一個空心湯　，老湯是聰明人，我門都成了傻瓜，這是值得自己駡着自己的。</p>
<p>在這風雲變色的當兒，一般無知無識以及目不識丁的人，依舊不變他們嘻天哈地的態度。我們又值得要駡着自己了！爲什麽要識字？爲什麽要有知識？爲什麽得了承德淪亡的消息要這般的忠愤塡　？蘇東坡説的：［人生識字憂患始。］念什麽撈什子的書呢？這又值得自己駡着自己的。</p>
<h3 id="c121">同胞不必着急 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 周靜谿</p>
<p>這幾天消息傳來，眞是糟糕丨湯玉麟竟然要緊同了　妾數人，一轉屁股就跑，將山河瘩手讓敵。老百姓莫不痛恨切齒，悲憤難宣。</p>
<p>但是，且慢，大家不要過激。我勸四萬萬同胞不必着急，更不必傷痛。要知道東北淪亡，山海關失守，熱河奉送給日本；老天爺早已在世界地圖上註明了。且也，嗚呼！（贊美也）中國空前绝後的幾位預言博士，像姜子牙，诸葛亮，李淳風，劉伯温等，不忍後人活活急死，也早已著有專集，暗示我們了。不論何時何代，出個把翻江倒海的英雄，亂世傾國的美人，一槪包羅無遺；祗須大家細心的推查一下就得啦！</p>
<p>總之，天下萬事皆已前定，人力無可回天。萬一日本把整個的中國吞下肚去。也是天所注定的，人能勉强嗎？</p>
<p>不過，倘若你的老婆在天津，或則你的兒子在北平，有些放心不下，那可到四馬路去買一本上面所説的專集回來詳細的看一下，將來平津如何？長江如何？西南如何？就有頭緒，有頭緒就有辦法而可放心。</p>
<p>唉！亡國是天注定的！同胞們何苦拚命呐喊，拚命打仗呢！</p>
<p>對酒當歌，人生幾何？春天到了，我們及時行樂啊！</p>
<h3 id="c122">大餅運動 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 廢名</p>
<p>報載燕京大學校工鑒於前方食糧缺乏。特自動發起大餅運動，餅大如鍋，直徑约二尺，厚三寸，每個重約十斤。請社會人士仿傚捐製，（見申報教育欄），大餅是北方吃當飯吃的一種　　（鼓話）邇日暢聆妙奏，覺鼓兒詞眞是絶妙民間文學，旣勝皮黃之　淺，又不如崑曲之晦　，情文生動，描寫酣　，一起一合，章法井然，寫景之妙，善用疊字，活捉中之靜悄悄軟情情悽慘慘黑沉沉何等有力？長板坡之［　埋　袖香唇冷，月照宫鞋透　紅］，則置之六朝文中，直可亂　　矣。</p>
<p>小黑之歌，如長江流水，一　千里，而有時雜以驚嘆語助詞，裂帛一聲，震驚四坐。其　子至美，能曲曲傳情於無言，微瞬之間，　下靡不洞曉其喜怒哀樂之意緒，而爲之變容倾坐焉。</p>

<p>第一回推食殷勤　邀貧女憶入門慷慨别具武夫雄</p>
<p>老姑娘一向是個進出自由的北京姑娘，於今突然的説是不許姑娘出門，這如何可以辦到。所以在這天，江氏老把一個臉子绷着，老姑娘不好意思出門，到了次日上午，伊依然到海匈街上買東西去了。當伊出門的時候，江氏就想着，要快快的回來才好。不料伊今天出去，恰是和伊母親的意思相反，出去了許久，還不見回來。江氏心裏一急，在屋子裏就有些起坐不寗，自己就跑到大門口來，向各處盼望。盼望了許久。自己的閨女不曾回來，却有個軍官，騎了一匹棗紅色高馬，走來門口。這個地方，離着西苑營房不遠，每日來往軍人，也是有的，一個騎馬的軍官走過，這倒也不足爲奇，並不曾予以注意。不料那一匹高大的棗紅馬，到了面前，却是突然的站定，那個軍官一　下馬，手上拿了一條馬鞭子，直挺挺的站在江氏面前，江氏出其不意的，倒嚇了一大跳，手扶了門，人倒向後退了兩步。那軍官並不是像伊意料中的那樣一個人物，手上拿着的馬鞭子埀了下來，那一隻手，却取下了帽子，笑嘻嘻的和伊點了一個頭道；老太太，你也住在這所房子裏面的嗎？江氏看那樣子，倒是很客氣的，没有什麽魯莽的習氣。便也放下笑容來答道：對了，我們住在這裏的，老總打聽什麽人？那軍官笑道：我不打聽誰，我呌趙自强，是個連長，現駐紥在這西苑大營裏，我有個老太爺，要帶一個用人，搬到這後院裏來，你們這後院房子是我賃了，以後咱們是院鄰啦，遇事請你多照應。江氏一聽説後院是個軍官賃了去了，腦筋裏面，早就留下了個惡印象，現在看趙自强不是那種不講理的樣子，心中早合式了一半。便笑道：我們是窮人，又是娘兒俩，諸事還要請你携帶携帶呢？趙自强將馬拴在大門外的石椿上，便走了進來，問道：老太太，你貴姓？江氏笑道：怎麽這樣稱呼？不敢當；我姓楊。（七）</p>

<p>曾某的［不朽之作］。已經有許多位先生批評過，這裏按下不表。且來談談怎樣是解放。</p>
<p>大凡文藝上的一種［解放運動］，不是憑空起來的。首先，必然是因爲社會上先有了新舊思想的衝突。新的思想要用文藝的方式來表現，就感到舊有的文藝體制不適用，於是就創造出新體來了。這樣由新的内容産生了新的形式，　能算是文藝上的某種［解放］。</p>
<p>現在的白話詩，對舊體詩而言，就是一種解放；因爲兩者之間不單是形式不同，内涵的思想意識也完全兩樣。但這話也有例外。近來有許多白話詩在思想意識方面，實在還是封建思想的螟蛉子，丨丨從那種窮愁牢騷的呻吟到才子佳人式的新戀愛描寫，無一不是封建詩人的瘦影子；雖則儼然是白話詩了，但新店裏賣舊貨，此種白話詩和舊體詩的區别正好像舊體詩中古風與律絶之分。　　曾某做的許多白話詩，實在就是那樣的舊體詩螟蛉子式的東西。所以他現在完全依着舊詞律來塡［打打麻將］的新詞，倒是比較老實的辦法。去掉什麽［解放］的野人頭可矣！那不是省了一塲口舌？而目君不見又一新詞人章某並没戴上野人頭的［解放］，却早已上接納蘭性德的衣鉢而［不朽］了麽？</p>
<h3 id="c192">笨賊 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 健甫</p>
<p>在今日烏烟瘴氣的新文壇，許多與印刷所接近的人，都大出其書，他們雖可騙得幾個造　錢，［打打麻將，］但使得一班純潔的青年受害不淺。這種自動萬花鏡，若不拆穿，中國人恐只好永遠歌誦［僞國的太平］了。</p>
<p>自從自由談論語等刋物，將章某曾某的眞相暴露以後，我們至少認識了什麽是現代的［白描聖手］和［解放專家］。章某不僅偷了納蘭性德的整首浪淘沙，就是他的代表作什麽樓詞第一首虞美人第四句［最是不堪回首月明中］，也仍是偷了後主［故國不堪回首月明中］之句。易［故國］二字爲［最是］，雖非詞人的任何小偷都能辦到，但不料竟成了章某的絶唱。這樣的［正統派］，倒像梁山泊時遷的衣鉢弟子。這樣的［白描聖手］不呌他［詞賊］，呌他甚麽？</p>
<p>章某對於詞的平仄，都用的［徽州］音，可惜他的主人胡適之的徽州音，與他又兩樣。其玉樓春首二句［漠漠曉烟籠碧樹，兒童牽犢臨流去］與菩薩蠻首句［郎是浮雲儂是絮］，我們都得先從章某學會了［徽州］音才能讀得順口。無怪柳亞子，氏駡他［以誤傳誤，貽害青年］了</p>
<p>解放大家曾某的解放理論，更可笑。他説：</p>
<p>（一）詞一定要有譜，否則與詩無異，因爲詞是有音樂關係，所以</p>
<p>（二）詞必須要講平仄；但不必講陽平陰平，不論平上去入。</p>
<p>（三）詞句要完全白描，或近於白話式的淺近文言，絶對不用典或深奥陳腐的文言，即（一）不解放，（二）半解放，（三）全解放。</p>
<p>這就是他的［三分之一五］的解放。我們雖不　（一）不解放與（三）全解放如何能一致，但要用譜，要有平仄，要白描。實係唐五代詞的故技，即後人東坡稼軒也是一樣。東坡爲詞，有時且隨意變更其句子的長短。詞在古代，本爲一種通俗文學，唐五代詞人及詞聖李後主他們的作品，根本就是白描，根本没有用典和深奥陳腐的文言，根本就用不着今人的解放。張泌的江城子［好是問伊來得麽，和笑道，莫多情］，宋李清照的如　令［誰伴明窗獨坐，我共影兒兩個，燈盡欲眠時，影也把人抛　，無那，無那，好個凄凉的我］。這不是白話嗎？清納蘭性德的飲水詞和側帽詞，吳蘋香女史的花簾詞，都是絶妙的作品，他們誰用了典？誰用了深奥陳腐的文言？詞本來是白話的，［凡有井水飲處，就有人唱柳詞］，如果是文言，這些挑水的與站在井邊喝水的鄉民，他們能了解而傅唱嗎？只有宋南渡以後的没落詞人，才喜歡用典，然而這已是下劣的作品。古今眞正了解和愛好詞的人，莫不尊崇南渡以前的詞，後人捨本逐末，徒遺笑柄，所以曾某所提出之三大主張，原是詞的源起，又何勞千載後多此一舉丨曾某的解放理論，實不成爲一種理論，更談不上什麽運動了。</p>
<p>曾某本來是一個不學無術的東西，一個和章某一樣的小偷。他最得意的傑作，而且被無識者許爲［摇魂蕩魄］的［不朽名著］的醉花陰：</p>
<p>［病裏無力消永　，寂寞情如舊。獨自到花陰，萬紫千紅但覺香盈袖。羣芳伴我黃昏後，沉醉心初透。安得不銷魂，如此春光只合江南有。］</p>
<p>便是抄了李清照的醉花陰。虧他還有臉孔刋出！善於做賊的，總不易使人發現其　物，而章某曾某却偷了人家的土地做家神，未免太笨得可憐了。</p>
<p>原來曾某是想繼［胡適之一度嘗試而成功］，只可惜［管他娘］的不朽名句，只能丢在馬桶裏，與屎尿同臭腐丨</p>
<p>末了，我要奉勸一班青年，你們如果對於詞感着興趣，你們儘可去買唐五代詞·北宋諸家詞及清納蘭性德等的詞讀，絶對不可買那些自吹自擂的［詞賊］所［放］的詞來看，否則，你們要上天下的大當！</p>
<h3 id="c193">賣雞蛋片的婦人 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 王婉容</p>
<p>自小便喜歡吃鷄蛋片，黃黃的，又香甜，又爽脆，委實可口極了！每天下午兩點鐘光景，巷裏便有賣鷄蛋片的喊聲：［阿要奚蛋片···阿要鷄蛋片···］音調曼長，嘹喨清脆。我聽見這呌聲近了，便從樓窗裏探出頭去喊一聲［喂，請等一會兒！］於是那個賣鷄蛋片的江北姑娘，在那兒停了脚，仰起頭，在一方雪白的包頭巾下露出一張豐腴的圓臉；兩顆明亮的帶着笑意的眸子，在我面前閃着。我便把一隻小籃子用繩子從窗口送去，那個江北姑娘便從籃子裏拿去兩個銅子，放兩片鷄蛋片在裏面。漸漸地習慣了，每天聽見桌子上的時鐘打了兩下，便惦記着那個姑娘了。只要聽見她遠遠地走進巷的呌唤聲，我便會放下了手中玩的或吃的，伏在窗口等她；她不不用我招呼了，走過我家樓下，便拿了兩片鷄蛋片，仰起頭來等我放小籃子下去。我一面嚼着鷄蛋片，一面看她携了籃子，提起兩隻瘦伶伶的小脚，拖着曼長的呌賣聲走出巷去。</p>
<p>近幾年所有的光陰都消磨在異鄉，那個姑娘和香甜可口的鷄蛋片，也漸漸地被淡忘了。</p>
<p>去年寒假回家，一天午後我懶懶地躺在椅上看小説，陽光照在我身上，有些倦意：門檻上伏着的大花貓，也懶洋洋地在打盹。桌子上的臘梅吐着幽香。</p>
<p>遠遠地又來了賣鷄蛋片的呌聲，音調凄顫發沙。我好像回憶到了什麽，痴痴地推開窗，剪刀樣的北風向我面上撲來，我鼓着勇氣，伸出　子向下望去。聽見窗子響動而抬起來的還是白包頭巾裏着的頭，但頭巾下露出的是一張已有　紋而現得憔悴消瘦的中年婦人的臉，那兩顆眸子放出悒鬱的光來，好像也回憶到了什麽，對我痴望了一會。隨後她便拖着凄動的微弱的呌賣聲走出巷去了。　　我至今還懷疑着，這個憔悴的婦人，就是幾年前那個豐腴的少女嗎？</p>
<p>同樣，這賣鷄蛋片的婦人，也許在懷疑着這端靜的姑娘就是幾年前每天伏在窗口上買鷄蛋片的，拖着雙辫的小女孩罷！</p>
<h3 id="c194">法郎士與古物 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 沈起予</p>
<p>人們常説法郎士與蕭伯納可稱爲歐洲文壞的雙璧，因爲兩個都善於［幽默］。其中，蕭伯納的壽運眞好，到了七十七歳，還能［老而不死］，還能到中國來幽默一下，更還能對［古物南遷］幽默一下。</p>
<p>可是，蕭伯納對於古物南遷的幽默，也不外説了些［似古物較數百萬北平人民之生命爲更重要］（見申報所載他的談話）一類的話。而這樣的話，早就有中國人説過，所以從幽默家的蕭伯納説來，似乎没有多大的幽默意思。</p>
<p>至於那一生在古書，古董，古···中間生活過來的法郎士，不幸自己也在前幾年［作了古］，不能親到中國來，因之我們也無從聽他的對於古物南遷的意見。可是他曾經對於阿拉伯人寫過如下的諷剌：</p>
<p>［用帕爾米的寺院的大理石來自建一座小舍的阿拉伯人，比倫敦，　巴黎，穆尼夕等的博物院的一切保管人都要更像哲人些。］</p>
<p>這不已經是法郎士對於古物南遷的間接的諷剌了麽！</p>
<p>帝國主義者常把中國人視爲阿拉伯人；阿拉伯人旣能利用古物來爲自己建築小屋，我們也何嘗不能把古物利用起來呢！與其遠在北平偷偷摸摸地幹，何不把它搬進租界，爽爽快快利用一下呢？</p>
<p>這樣，在大多數的反對聲中，古物终於在前幾天　怩怩地走進了租界，而我們也就與阿拉伯人［逼肖逼眞］了。</p>

<p>— 蕭伯納作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>［我没有尋求幸福；我尋求神，］黑女孩子説。</p>
<p>［你還不曾找到他麽？］那術士説。</p>
<p>［我找到了許多神］黑女孩子説。［凡有我所逼到的　有一個介紹給我；這黑這一個造像的人也有着滿舖子的神哩。可是在我看來，那些却都是半死的，除了像那頭一塊架板上面吹着口笛的半羊半人那一個似的半獸形的幾個以外。那一個是很自然相的；因爲雖然我也想做女神，我自己却是半山羊半女人。爲什麽那些中間没有一個是半女人呢？］</p>
<p>［追一個怎麽樣？］造像的人指着梵納斯説。</p>
<p>［爲什麽好的卜身用衣棠遮着？］黑女孩子説。［她旣不是女神又不是女人；人她一半身子　得羞答答，還有一半是白人所謂女士。她是女士模樣，又長得美麗，白人的總督會喜歡得她做他家裏的當家的罷；可是我以爲她是没有良心的；這就使她成爲非人性而又不成神樣了。我用不着她。］</p>
<p>［道］（註）這東西，　當用肉體來造，白石是不行的］衛士説。［你不可因爲這些神有着人身的緣故就　　。如果他們没有爲你們　出人性模樣來，那麽，你怎麽能够和他們有什麽相通呢？要使神性和人性之間有一個連索，有的神必須成爲人。］</p>
<p>（註）［道就是上帝］（見約翰福音）</p>
<p>［有的女人也不妨成爲神］黑女孩子説。［　就好得多了，因爲降而做人的神是使他自己　落的；成了神的女人却使她自己升高］，</p>
<p>［上帝是我　着一切　煩的女人的避難所］（註）那亞拉伯人説。［這是我所遇到的最　煩的女人了。將女人造得美麗，同時也造得　煩；還是上帝的神秘的手法之一呀。他給她們　當滿足的理性愈多，她们就愈不滿意，這個人是甚至　於極有威嚴和勢力的上帝本身也不滿意的。哦哦，大姑娘　，光榮偉大的上帝旣討不了你的喜歡，還有什麽神什麽女神討得呢？］</p>
<p>（註）參見舊約</p>
<p>［有一個女神，她是我聽到過的，我要多曉得些］黑女孩子説。一她名呌買奈；我覺得她這里有着别的神們誰也不能給我們的什麽東西。］</p>

<p>— 賡</p>
<p>亘十八個月之久，猶未告一段落之國難，我國一面要咬緊牙關，忍受着暴日不斷的給予我們種種創傷，一面又要强顔爲歡，靜候國聯的如何發落，際此荆天棘地，滿目瘡痍之秋，稍有一線曙光，足以期期自慰者，厥爲每次　聯開會，猶有多數小國之能仗義執言耳。詎料近日事出意外，惡耗頻傳，高鄰小國丨丨暹羅，突以［媚日］［排華］聞</p>
<p>暹羅與中國，同爲亞洲之弱小國家，因有歷史之攸久關係，地理之密切關係，故暹羅人口九百餘萬中，竟有華僑混血種至二百餘萬之多，而其皇室血統，亦爲華人　　。從而知彼此在國際上之關係，宜乎唇齒相依，守望相助矣。乃彼暹羅，不知究何宅心，乘我之危，［狗　下坡兎］似的而對我大搗其蛋；始則棄權通過國聯報告書，顯係助長暴日之凶燄；繼則向歐洲大購軍火，轉售於日；最近更頒行小學每週至少教授暹文二十五小時之法令，顯以限制我華僑所辦之小學無暇可教漢文。暹羅之甘爲暴日張目，而以虎倀自居，是何緣故</p>
<p>按國聯盟約第十六條第一項，［會員國如有不顧盟約而從事戰爭者，其他各會員國當立即與彼斷絶各種商業上或財政上之關係］，暴日係一破壞盟約國，暹羅係負有［立與破壞盟约國斷絶關係］之會員國，而今不但不與暴日斷絶關係，反來悶着良心地大幹其［媚日］［排華］的勾當，謂非倒行逆施，達於極度而何？</p>
<p>且也，［欲征服世界，先征服支那］之日本大陸政策，縱遠西各列强聞之，尚深感不安，彼危立近東之蕞爾暹羅，獨不念及［鄰之厚，若之薄］，［唇亡則齒寒］之切身利害，而趁早認清某也將爲我之勁敵，某也將爲我之至友者，豈非大惑不解也耶？</p>
<p>至於昨報又載暹羅否認販賣軍火之消息，尤足見暹人之固爲熌灼態度，以淆世人，負有外交上折衝之巨任者，尤須予以深切之注意焉！</p>

<p>枉作干城是熱湯，敵兵犯境便張皇，喪師失地成何事，棄我邊圉實可傷。</p>
<p>遼吉沈淪已可哀，熱河又失更驚猜，版圖日蹙猶未醒，何日雄飛失地恢。</p>
<p>一片喧傳救國聲，幾多狂熱顯民情，何如抵抗徒憑口，不戰又抛承德城。</p>

<p>— 琰瑾</p>
<p>近世科學事業的發達，眞有一日千里之勢，又爲了要使殺人利器的効用率增加，對于實施軍用科學方面又發現許多的驚人新術；最近的空中測量，便是這數千百個中的一個。</p>
<p>砲彈發射出在空中的路線是弧形抛物缐，最詳細的軍用地圖上用比例尺算出的距離是水平距離，這是有普通學識的都知道的，但是地面决不是完全平坦的，甲地和乙地的地形高底决不能説全是在一條水平線上的，因此許多砲兵們雖然有了極精細的機械和微妙的計算，而發出的子彈，仍不能命中，爲了這個緣故，空中測量的需要，就　然而生了。</p>
<p>空中測量需要的人材，决不是一班普通的平地測量員，他要的是航空人員而能攝影的，測量的方法是極簡單，祗要在離地約二百尺高度時，用特製的攝影機（如拍影戲用者然），向地下連續攝影。</p>
<p>攝影完畢後就同照相一樣的把底片洗曬，因爲每張底片可用的丨清淅的丨祇有其中的一方，所以要有一張完全可用的地形圖，一定要有一番相當的剪接，一切都好了，就可把　印在一張平面的寫影纸上。</p>
<p>照相上的高底，可由顔色深淡來鑒定，這張已拍就的地形照相，可由繪圖者從上面畫出許多的投影線來；（Ｐerspectivelines），從此計算出地形確實的高底。洞悉了二地的水平距離和高距離，發砲的士兵，不難把他應該發出子彈的確實距離算出；所以可以每發命中，彈無虚發，這是多麽驚人的一會事。</p>
<p>據説：數星期前，熱河邊界上每日出没的日軍不發彈的鐵鳥，便是他們的測量機。</p>

<p>一條閙市後的一所大厦前，忽來了四個同色制服，佩着校徽的中學生；二個的手中各執着白竹布的號旗，一個拿着一大束傳學，一個携着隻黑皮包。他們的臉上，都有莊嚴英挺的神氣，他們的步武整齊而又清晰。</p>
<p>忽地，他們都停在大厦前了，而更走上了幾層石級，朝門房裏張看，一個穿荆布衫的中年男人出來了，他們不等他詢問就述説要見見這裏的主人。那中年男人聽後，皺皺眉，但看看都是斯文人，只和懶洋洋地引導。穿過了幾道灣曲的門，在一間富麗堂皇的客室中坐下。他們想：［這麽闊的場面，今天的捐助，最低的數目，至少一百或五十了。］於是他們都屏聲靜氣的聽着那荆布衫的男人傳説：</p>
<p>［老爺：有幾位洋學堂裏的學生來求見］。</p>
<p>［媽的，你飯　滿了嗎？不時引着這般小鬼來尋開心，滾出去，哼····］。</p>
<p>［唔唔！東家耐耐氣，抽一筒兒］。</p>
<p>那老爺的口中似有東西塞入了，着着實實靜默了好一會，只有那鴉片烟氣彌漫着内室。</p>
<p>［王先生：眞不知道我幾天來的苦，小鬼們開口國難，閉口國難，你想我那裏有心思。大兒子生了肺病，臥在醫院裏，小兒子患了春瘟還須看郎中。你們太太又發舊疾，女兒下個月出嫁了，天天閙着辦嫁妝。國難國難，家難也顧不好呢！眞是可恨，嗳！］</p>
<p>［唔唔！東家耐耐氣，再抽一筒。你還立着討駡麽？快去回復了小鬼們，此後休引了進來。］</p>
<p>［是是，謝謝王師爺］。那男人哭喪着臉兒出來了，　了兩個白眼給學生們。</p>
<p>四個爲國奔走的青年，不禁怒滿胸膛了，迅速地離開客室，但聽得裏邊又談起話來。</p>
<p>［王行狂：給我想想啊，兒子們的病怎樣可以　解呢？唉！］</p>
<p>［是是，東家，明天我準到大悲寺去一趟，請當家派幾個師父來給少爺們演演星宿。不要緊，東家：悔氣錢多用幾個，也管少爺們立刻生龍活虎。好了，東家，再抽筒兒］。</p>
<p>［王先生，你乏了，也抽筒吧！］［呵！謝謝東家］。</p>
<p>唉！一聲長長的歎息，從四位熱血青年的口中散佈到了空間。</p>

<p>這是在午前的一班特别快的二等車上。</p>
<p>［先生，對不住，自來火借我一用］！一個絡偲鬍的中年人，滿面堆歡的走來向那位髮光鑑人，西裝楚楚，斜靠着吸雪茄的青年説。</p>
<p>［自來火，茶房有的是］！那青年趕緊把放在茶几上，裝得滾壯的一只新皮包，移近車壁，且怕飛了似的還壓上一隻手，然後吐出兩個烟圈，對那中年人一睬不睬。</p>
<p>没有三分鐘，忽匆匆奔來一位Ｆeace漂亮，服裝入時的摩登女郎，兩耳及纎　玉指，都裝飾着光艶奪目的飾品，望着一個靠近坐着武裝同志的空位，似乎羞與爲伍，霎時便把視線移在青年臉上，喘吁吁地道：［眞倒霉，遲了一步就没坐位］！</p>
<p>［唔！］那青年好像受了電的感應似的只見他　部一動，便恰恰讓出一個坐位來。</p>
<p>［謝謝！］她便嫣然坐下。</p>
<p>［勿要客氣！］</p>
<p>［先生眞和氣，尊姓？那裏發財？］</p>
<p>［姓金，初由比國回來，現在國府主計處任點小事。］</p>
<p>［哦，金先生是到南京，我也要到南京；不過南京我從未去過，靠近教育部的旅館，不知阿有漂亮的？］</p>
<p>［中央飯店頂漂亮了！大槪女士是想在教育部高升吧？］</p>
<p>［不過有這樣一個計劃而已；倘不成功，還要仰大力介紹介紹呢！］</p>
<p>［豈敢豈敢！］金先生喜的心花怒放。</p>
<p>［崑山到哉！崑山到哉！］茶房施聲揚氣的呌着；車也停住了。</p>
<p>［勝似美畫的春景，眞令人愛極了！金先生阿要看看？］女士從車窗縮頭進來，似乎因要央請同伴共賞美景，只略一偏首，不妨左耳擦着車窗、她便［呀］的一聲：［先生！你看怎麽辦？我的鑽石珥環碰落了！］</p>
<p>金先生意識到馬上就要開車，趕緊伸首俯視，果見一只金幌幌的珥環落在車軌旁邊發光。於是他便自告捷足，大踏步繞出車去，替她把珥環揀回來，到了原座，大吃一驚道，［啊呀！　　　錯了車麽？怎麽不見了女士的芳影　我裝着五千元現欵的皮包？］</p>
<p>只聞［嗚嗚嗚］的幾聲，拿着電鍍玻光當眞寳珥環那位青年，他的如醉如痴的兩眼，第見一株株的電桿，一窪窪的畦田，漸漸地移動，瞬逝，消失於後方的濃烟薄霧中去了！</p>

<p>— 勞紹周</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>舍親某甲，在原籍地方，與友人合夥，開設錢莊一所；甲自爲經理。今年該莊股東，略有改動；有新股東某乙，因家庭關係，不能出面。甲因無其他股東，可以拉籠，因商議於余，囑余代爲出面；余因親戚關係，不忍坐視他遂成之局，廢於一旦，因亦慨然允許。正式　　上，均由余出面，簽名　印：惟余與某乙間，另立支議單一紙，由某甲作證，蓋用該莊書柬，及某甲私章。載明該莊日後盈虧，均由某乙一人享負，與鄙人無涉。事後想起來，當時不免造次了些；現在我要請問。</p>
<p>（一）是項支議單，法律上是否可生効力？</p>
<p>（二）倘該莊營業失敗，虧耗在資本以上，而某乙無力擔負時，是否須由余擔負？</p>
<p>先生高明，還祈示復爲荷。（下略）</p>

<p>編者按：這種代人出面的事情，社會裏非常之多：有許多糾紛，也因此産生。勞君問的兩個問題的答復：第一個是［當然發生效力］。因爲契約這東西，雖説要講求手續：但有時手續即使不完全，祗要牠足以爲［意思之表示］時，在法律上已認爲有効。第二個問題的答復，就比較複雜了。假使虧耗的數目，某乙的力量，足可擔負，那末除非他是一個未成年人，或禁治産者，他就不能逃此責任。要是虧耗數目，超出了某乙的能力，那你就要負責了。總之你與某乙兩人間訂的支議單，當然含些秘密性，並不公開；法律規定，這種契約，祗在當事人間發生効力，决不能對抗不知情之第三者。所以萬一不幸，虧耗之數，超過資本時，勞君是第一位負責者，某乙不過對勞君負責而已。</p>

<h3 id="c265">珍妮蓋諾離婚之後 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>珍妮蓋諾和她丈夫宣告離異之消息傳出後，各國報紙上；莫不登載於緊要的地位。而對於珍妮蓋諾離婚的内幕如何？珍妮離婚之用意何在？外界多推測之詞，傳説紛紜，莫衷一是。茲就她的母親和她的代理律師所發表的談話上緊要的幾點，説一説，我們就有了結論了。</p>
<p>珍妮的代理律師説；珍妮委請他和李杜爾貝克提出離異，前後共三次，以前的二次都是暗中進行，而且結果都是和解。所以外人知者絶少，而珍妮之所以要離婚的理由，並不十分充足。第一次是爲了珍妮在海濱建造别墅，預備避暑，她主張在海灘上造一個精緻的遊廊，好像碼頭般的東西，而李杜爾則絶端反對，主張造化花園，二人因之口角，而珍妮遂據爲離婚之理由。第二次因爲在宴會上珍妮，和一個男子同舞，而李杜爾竟因此而和珍妮大閙，幾欲動武。這二次的事件發生之後，珍妮即赴火奴魯魯居住，而李杜爾二次都追蹤而至向珍妮道罪。她遂撤回訴訟。第三次就是這次了，理由完全没有，祇是雙方意見不合而已。</p>
<p>珍妮的母親説；［我和女婿之間，並無什麽不合的意見，他待我好像自己的母親。珍妮同他提出離異共三次，而實在前後共齟齬了五次，每次爭吵，珍妮都因之生病，而爭吵的理由，又不十分充足，甚至有一次竟爲了吃菜而爭吵。我細細盤詰珍，妮她又講不出什麽原因。</p>
<p>照二個人的談話看來，可見珍妮和李杜爾的結合，完全不是出於本心，否則没有什麽充分的理由，何致於提出了三次的離異呢？所以珍妮嫁給李杜爾是同却爾法雷鬥氣之説，更可證實。今法雷毅然辭職，表示和珍妮袂别，但珍妮已鐘情於法雷，勢不能再和李杜爾共偕白首，今法雷去了，珍妮無法挽回，故提出離婚，所以示不忘於法雷。</p>
<p>珍妮之用意如此，而法雷對之將如何？據訪得確息，珍妮宣告離婚後，却爾法雷家裏的電話鈴聲不息，他的友好，都報告他，和探聽他如何表示，他曾於一星期中接到詢問他和珍妮是否將復合的信，共計二萬多封。他雖然表示他和他的妻子佛及尼亞的情好，不致受珍的妮牽制，但是好萊塢的人士都不相信他説的是眞話。預料法雷和佛及尼亞間的離異，亦是時間上的問題罷了。</p>

<h3 id="c266">評棄夫（ＡＢillofDivorceinent） <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>凡是看過約翰巴里摩亞（ＪohnＢarr　more）表演的人們，我想誰都會欽敬他表演的深刻，雖然不是每一作品，都是非常成功，但是他决不會使我們何等失望的。即就本片而論，比之在大飯店中所飾的角色，就有驚人的成功，當然這與劇本有着密切的關係，而［棄夫］的劇情，更是能夠使他盡量的發揮。</p>
<p>爲了對於本劇作一比較嚴密的檢討，當有簡單的叙述本片故事之必要。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰中，有多少快樂的家庭，因之夫離子散，有希拉雷者，（約翰巴里摩亞飾）因戰爭而傷其神經，入瘋人病院十餘年，及愈，返家，滿以爲可得妻之愛憐與安慰，雖知妻早因不欲寡守而另結新歡，並婚期在即，這時候希拉的悲慟，自在情理之中，而妻亦因之而困於愛的矛盾中。結果，瘋人希拉雷因體念着妻與新夫之愛的眞切，遂决然携其生女而度其悲慘的生活。其時希拉雷之女，亦有所戀，但她知道自身必有精神病的遺傳，恐怕將來遺害兒女，乃毅然與其戀人脱離，而侍奉可憐的老父終身。</p>
<p>在這樣的故事中，可以説其中没有一個可給我們非議的人物。雖然希拉雷的行動不忍忽心，但是爲了愛，爲了她的前途，也是十分合理的。當然，希拉雷之女的决然獨守終身，其理智之堅强，也是十分可佩的。然而最苦的當是這神經病的希雷了。旣如此，所有的人物都是如此之好，那末，在演出上確是不容易獲得成功，因爲要使觀衆對於所有的人們，都給與同情，確是不大容易的，然而在本片中却做到了這一點，所以這便是本片的成功。</p>
<p>全劇演來，當然是巴里摩亞斯擔當的角色最爲吃力，因此，本片的導演，也就特别着重在巴里摩亞身上。但是他對於瘋人的女兒，（ＫatbarineHepburn飾）也是非常注意的。他對整個劃的進行。都是毫不鬆懈。而簡要有力的運用着。特别是對於每個角色内心的表演，充分的給與演員以發揮的機會。尤其是在最後的場面，他將重要而繁難的劇情，完全寄托在披亞娜的音調中，使觀衆接收他有力的剌激，這一點使我們不得不佩服他手段的高强。不在　開始的時候，爲了要對劇情加以介紹，帶着舞台劇的情調，總多少令人不能興奮的。</p>
<p>關於燈光的運用，使得本劇生色不少，這使我們相信一種柔和的光綫對於悲劇是非常適宜的，但是假如還能夠暗淡而清晰，（如戰地情天中的光綫）該是更加美麗而使本劇增加力量的吧。對白很多，但是均爲必要，收音已逹完美的境地，佈景也很適宜。</p>
<p>最後關於演員們的技巧，除了约翰的深刻入微有如上述以外，那個飾女兒的新進的女角，也是很值得我們注意的。她的面部，動作，都與葛萊泰嘉寳相似，也許是她極力　仿嘉寳的原故，其餘諸人，不見精采，但亦不破壞劇情。</p>

<h3 id="c268">評城市之夜 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 萍影</p>
<p>在這瓊樓傑閣，電燈輝煌的城市，滿眼都是酒，肉，汽車，····享樂這一類的東西。然而貌雖如此，地下層却埋掩了成萬的被富人們剝削得血肉殆盡而仍須整天整晚在那兒挨苦挨餓出賣體力的人們。聯華公司這部［城市之夜］，就是針對着這點來描寫城市的罪惡，揭開城市的黑幕，并指示有爲的青年，不要爲紙醉金迷的城市麻醉了自己的本性。這是一部多麽有意義的影片啊！</p>
<p>編劇者的手腕高妙，眞使我們稱讚，他處處不放鬆地顯露出階級懸殊和貧富對點，尤其是那女工看到自己父親病的危急，自己又被工廠裏開除，家中錢米殆盡之時，而下最大决心忍痛爲她所不屑爲之事丨丨把她自己的肉體投進到魔鬼的世界。及她父親發覺她的行爲後的憤慨，决絶。這正表現得眞正工人底意識和身份。</p>
<p>導演的手腕也確實不錯，他把演員在劇情上都能指揮如意。</p>
<p>演員方面，金燄和小明星黎鏗，恰到好處，阮玲玉是本片中最成功的一個，她的動作和表情，令人始終找不出一點兒破綻，其餘王桂林李君槃也還可以，劉繼羣扮演片中的小名人，身份狠稱，張美美湯天　幾個配角雖屬不大自然，但亦不能减本片之色。</p>
<p>鏡頭擺得還靈活，佈景也不差，不過在字幕上説明第幾本完，我看是畫蛇添足，儘可不必。</p>
<p>總之；此片堪稱國産中的傑作。</p>
<h3 id="c269">談［城市之夜］ <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 聲宏</p>
<p>看完了揭破特别階級的罪惡，和爲被壓迫大衆呼喊的［城市之夜］，我們深感聯華影片公司得着大成功了。</p>
<p>這張片的意誠，已抓住現在中國的時代，描繪有錢的享樂，無産者的受苦，眞是淋漓盡致，當然，這一張［城市之夜］又是大衆所須要的片子，也是緊跟着時代表現的貢獻？</p>
<p>片中的穿插，我們極佩服導演的聽明，他把富豪的家庭，襯托出苦力的家庭，使觀衆了解富家和苦力怎樣的苦樂，［這許多人都是無家可歸了，我還回什麽家呢！］可説是全片中極有力的話，其他富家的貓和苦力家的貓的比像有極大的意義包括，使觀衆的情緒更形緊張，阮玲玉演到老父因病不得已出賣肉體時，確使觀衆的心弦，隨着劇中人的心神而緊張震　。</p>
<p>論到演員，以阮玲玉最爲成功。在大雨倾盆中尋找老父的幾幕，涕泗滂沱，令人　　。使觀衆灑了幾滴同情之涙。金　的表演並没有顯出他的天才，但是那風流瀟灑的狀　，颇能助長劇情的發展。</p>
<p>［城市之夜］的成功，導演的功勞要佔一半，除穿插使觀衆欽佩外，對於演員的配合搭擋尤有高見。</p>

<p>— 時</p>
<p>她想警告王后，可是這位國母對于拉斯蒲丁的迷信太深，中毒太甚，决不會聽她的警告的。而保羅已不復在帝邊帮着她了。她對他的不信任，已把他生生地逼走了。</p>
<p>有一夜，拉斯蒲丁到王宫，　進她的閨房想　慰她，想沉醉在她的懷裏，妮　　　怒地反抗他的侮辱，而她的　小的嬌軀那裏是他的對手。丁拉斯蒲笑着推倒她。在她無能爲力之時，於是他的眼深深地凝視着她的。</p>
<p>［睡啊，我的小寳貝，］他命令。</p>
<p>於是，像小太子一般的順從他，像别的名婦小姐們一般的屈服於他，妮塔嘉也被他屈服了。她立刻就深深地迷睡。拉斯蒲丁笑着望她。</p>
<p>他的　火忽然地熄滅。他不要她，因爲她曾同他這般的反抗。還有更貴重的獎品可得，那王帝的大女兒，　梨娜，已經長成了，她便睡在鄰室。</p>
<p>他急切地走進門去，他無意之間把一座燈架　倒在地上。外面實然地起了一陣　疾的脚聲，他鬼鬼崇崇地守候，門開時王后站在那兒。</p>
<p>［神父，你嚇死我了！］她喘息着。過一會兒説：［這燈架怎麽倒在地上？］</p>

<h3 id="e5">Encouraging General Chiang Kai-shek <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>When Rehe was in imminent danger, we appealed to General Chiang Kai-shek to temporarily delegate his responsibility for suppressing bandits to other generals and to travel north as soon as possible, in order to boost morale and demonstrate the government's determination to resist. However, before long, the natural defenses of Rehe were lost, and the shield of North China was completely removed. As we look around at the broken mountains and rivers and contemplate the difficult road ahead, we are heartbroken and at a loss. But now we hear that General Chiang is going north.</p>
<p>At this time when the people of the whole country are looking to him, General Chiang has resolutely gone north. Is it to clean up the situation in North China, or is it to plan to resist tyranny and defend against insults? In our opinion, without uniting to resist tyranny externally, there is no way to clean up the situation in North China. Therefore, General Chiang's trip north is not just for cleaning up North China. Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the whole country have been filled with grief and indignation, enduring pain and holding their breath, waiting for the recovery of lost territory. However, after the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang fell, Jinzhou and Yuguan were also successively seized by the clutches of the Japanese army. Now Rehe has also been lost. Zhang Xueliang, who holds a large army and sits comfortably in Beiping indulging in extravagance and pleasure, the people of the country have long realized that he is not reliable and have long realized that he is not worth blaming. However, the government's hesitation and deliberation, its inability to make decisive decisions, cannot but share the responsibility. Now, we can only hope that our government will strengthen discipline and assert its authority, on the one hand, severely punishing those who have harmed the country with due punishment, and on the other hand, reorganizing the national army to recover lost territory. A telegram from various public associations in Shanghai stated: "Our people and the government must know that the loss of Rehe is not due to the soldiers' unwillingness to fight, nor to the general generals' lack of courage to fight. The blame lies solely with the senior generals who bear the full responsibility of command. On the one hand, we deeply hate the unforgivable crime of losing territory before losing troops. On the other hand, we should consider that the unity of the generals and soldiers and the cooperation between the military and the people can still achieve something. If the country has constant punishment, then the soldiers will be full of vigor. Our people should still work together with all their efforts, from beginning to end, to try to remedy the situation to the best of our ability." These words are truly what General Chiang should deeply consider.</p>
<p>Today, all the people of the country are looking east at the tyrannical Japanese, sharing the same hatred of the enemy. If the government can resolutely resist the tyrannical Japanese, then all the people of the country will be willing to follow the government and enthusiastically go to the country to meet the national crisis. Looking at the people's enthusiastic care and eager donations for Ma Zhanshan's volunteer army and the soldiers who resisted Japan in the Shanghai war, we can see that our people are definitely not willing to be people of a fallen country, and they have deep expectations for General Chiang. After Turkey's disastrous defeat in the European War in 1918, the government lost its center of gravity, and the whole country was in a state of disintegration. The Greek army, which advocated the Greater Greece Doctrine, took advantage of Turkey's crisis and launched a large-scale offensive, occupying Smyrna in 1919. However, General Kemal rose up in eastern Asia Minor and led the National Army, which had not been trained for long and lacked equipment, to resolutely resist the Greek army. He finally managed to drive the Greek army out of the country after three years of bitter fighting, laying the cornerstone of the new Turkey. If General Chiang can lead our people today to resolutely resist Japan's invasion, then he will be our country's Kemal. General Chiang, the people of the country have deep and urgent expectations. How will he comfort the expectations of the people of the country?</p>
<p>Outside the Great Wall, the drums are coming from the earth, and the clouds and winds in Yan and Ji are again close at hand. We imagine that General Chiang's trip will make him feel the depth of the enemy and the danger of the country, and he will resolutely rise up. What is closer to us than General Chiang's feelings is what he expressed to reporters in Zhengzhou recently: "Zhongzheng should move forward to the north, vowing to be a pioneer for the people of the country, to repay the party and the country." How magnificent are these words! If that is the case, then all the people of our country will look up to the flag and rise up together to serve the country, following General Chiang.</p>

<p>We Swear to Live and Die with Our Land</p>
<p>We hope that the people of the country will not abandon Rehe</p>
<p>The various newspapers of Rehe turn to all compatriots: The Japanese bandits have invaded Rehe, and their military strength is no more than tens of thousands, while our army is no less than hundreds of thousands. If we compare strength, it is not difficult to destroy them in one fell swoop. At the very least, we can defend ourselves. How could we abandon Zhaoyang and Lingyuan without a fight, and then retreat to Chengping under pressure? The mountains and rivers of Rehe Province are discarded like worn-out shoes. But the army can retreat, but where will the people go? A good territory is handed over to others, and the descendants of the gods will become slaves in an instant. Most of the people of Rehe can fight. Although we have been abandoned by others, how can we abandon ourselves? All the people of Zhaoyang and Lingyuan swear to live and die with our land. Now Zhaoyang and Lingyuan are in the rear of the enemy and have entered a state of mixed warfare. There is no battle line to speak of. If everyone fights on their own, the Japanese bandits will eventually be eliminated. If we wait with our hands in our pockets, then we will perish without a day. Now, in addition to striving to defend ourselves and vowing to resist to the death, the people of Zhaoyang and Lingyuan specially use blood to express their pain and plead with the people of the country not to abandon Rehe, not to forget the people of Rehe who are still struggling in suffering, and to quickly provide assistance and urge the troops to counterattack. The people of Rehe will swear to be the vanguard; otherwise, the death of the people of Rehe is not a pity, and the general situation of the country will be lost. Urgent declaration, we humbly ask for your consideration. Zhaoling Joint Village Autonomy Committee Seal (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Yang Hucheng Seeks a Way Out for the Army <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Part of the Army Diverts the Luo River to Irrigate Fields in Preparation for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Part of the Army Goes Beyond the Border to Resist Japan and Serve the Country</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Hucheng wrote to Yu Youren, stating that his province has long suffered from disasters and the people have no savings. The army's supplies have long been a concern. Using hungry people to support hungry soldiers is not only a matter of conscience but also indescribably painful. If a disaster were to occur, it would be unthinkable. The current national crisis is deepening, and survival is at stake. Since the central government has decided to resist for a long time, how can Hucheng bear to leave the strong soldiers of the three Qin regions in a useless place, sitting there to die without being able to do anything? He intends to divide part of the army to divert the Luo River to irrigate the fields in preparation for disaster relief and send part of the army beyond the border to resist Japan and serve the country. Reducing one hungry army in the province will save one hungry person. It is like killing two birds with one stone.

<p>The National News Agency reported from Berlin on the 8th that the new parliament has decided to hold the opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam on March 21, and plans to hold thanksgiving services at two other churches first. The opening ceremony will be performed by President Hindenburg. The president will first place a wreath in front of the mausoleum of Frederick the Great, followed by Hitler reading the government's policy statement. After that, parliamentary meetings will be held at the Kroll Opera House near the recently burned Reichstag building. Havas reported from Berlin on the 9th that the issue of abolishing the black, red, and gold republican flag and restoring the black, white, and red imperial flag is the most difficult issue to resolve when the parliament meets. The National Socialist Party wants to use the ____ as the official flag symbol, while the National People's Party wants to restore the imperial flag without adding the symbol.</p>

<p>Praises Eastern Art Unreservedly</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Tokyo on the 8th that Shaw spent two hours talking with Japanese Army Minister Araki. Araki did not agree with Shaw's remarks praising communism, but he approved of Shaw's statement that the first step towards genuine communism is to eliminate the existing Communist Party. Shaw then visited Prime Minister Saito. They mostly talked about longevity methods. Shaw also disagreed with the host on this point, as Shaw advocated abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and meat, while Saito said that these things do not harm the elderly.</p>
<p>The Electric Communication Agency reported from Tokyo on the 9th that Shaw, who is staying in Tokyo, went to the Takeidai Art Museum and the Museum of Ueno after meeting with Prime Minister Saito yesterday. He especially looked at the national treasures on display in the museum for a long time, praising the classics of oriental art. He then visited Asakusa and visited the main hall. After eating and painting, he listened to the Noh music organized by the Kaizo-sha at the Kudan Noh Theater from 3:00 PM, with Professor Noguchi explaining the (Ba) of the Konparu school and the (Peace) of the Okura school. He watched enthusiastically and praised the classical art from the Orient unreservedly. After watching Noh music, Shaw seemed to feel very comfortable, saying that this art makes me forget old age and cold.</p>

<p>Navy Budget Sharply Increased</p>
<p>Reuters reported from London on the 9th that the British naval budget for this fiscal year is more than 3 million British pounds higher than last year, totaling 53.57 million British pounds. Most of the increased funds are for normal construction costs, including four cruisers, one squadron flagship, eight destroyers, three submarines, and five small warships. These four cruisers are the last batch to be completed in 1936 in accordance with the compensatory procedures stipulated in the London Naval Treaty. The naval personnel will be reduced by more than a thousand people, but will still be around 90,000 people.</p>

<p>Openly Notifies Chairman Henderson</p>
<p>Changes Will Be Made to the National Defense Plan</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported from Geneva on the 8th that the disarmament conference, a ridiculous farce that is half-dead here, suffered another major fatal blow today, and the main culprit is Japan, which has not awakened from its militaristic dream. The Japanese delegation today openly notified Chairman Henderson that Japan feels compelled to expand its military equipment due to recent events in the Far East.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese delegation also notified the League of Nations Secretariat that Japan and the League of Nations have different views on the Manchurian Incident. Japan fears that it will withdraw from the League of Nations, but Japan is still willing to cooperate with the Disarmament Conference, but Japan really needs to reorganize its army. After the announcement of this declaration, the League of Nations was as frightened as if struck by lightning. This move will also have a significant impact on the Anglo-French talks to be held in Paris tomorrow.</p>
<p>Havas reported from Geneva on the 8th that Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, recently received a declaration from the Japanese government, stating that with regard to the Far East issue, Japan's views are incompatible with those of the League of Nations, which has led Japan to order its representatives to withdraw from the League of Nations, which is deeply regrettable. As for the Disarmament Conference, Japan will continue to participate, but Japan's national defense must be fundamentally changed due to certain obvious circumstances. This should be considered by the Disarmament Conference.</p>

<p>Havas reported from London on the 9th that Prime Minister MacDonald, accompanied by his daughter Miss Hepburn, and Foreign Secretary Simon, took a train from Victoria Station to Paris at 11:00 AM. The Prime Minister met with French Ambassador Faroliio on the platform and declared, "We must seek a result at the Disarmament Conference. This result may not be entirely what we want, but it will definitely be helpful for world peace."</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported from Paris on the 8th that French Prime Minister Daladier and British Prime Minister MacDonald will meet here tomorrow. It is heard that French Foreign Minister Pong and British Foreign Secretary Simon will also participate in this matter, which is of great importance to the future of the Disarmament Conference and is the most important matter in political circles today. As for the newspapers, they are very uneasy and worried about the British proposal to indefinitely postpone the Disarmament Conference and conclude a preliminary treaty with the meager results that have already been achieved. Newspapers such as the Morning Post believe that the Anglo-French meeting will determine the fate of the Disarmament Conference, while the News newspaper advocates Anglo-French cooperation and hopes that the United States will also join the Anglo-French group.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Obstacles to Disarmament: Germany Insists on Equal Status <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Reuter, Paris, 8th – Discussions between Britain and France regarding the difficult disarmament issue will commence this Friday. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will first have lunch with French Premier Daladier for a brief discussion before proceeding to Geneva. The French government has yet to express its attitude towards the British Prime Minister's proposal to halt the arms race for five years. The main obstacle in the disarmament process for France remains Germany's demand for immediate equality in armaments. However, France is likely to agree to a temporary convention, incorporating the points already agreed upon and acknowledging Germany's demand in principle. Judging from the general opinion in French circles, the British authorities may not receive a warm welcome, as public opinion believes that the disarmament conference is on its deathbed and Geneva can no longer achieve anything. *Le Liberté* claims that Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary all oppose France, and France should stay at home and guard its own web rather than go to Geneva to be caught in the spiderweb woven by Italy and Germany. *Le Débat* does not approve of the British proposal for a five-year arms truce, saying that it would only allow France and other peaceful nations to retreat, allowing the Hitler government to replenish its national defense forces and Italy to continue supplying Hungary with armaments.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 8th – German newspapers, while not placing much emphasis on the Five-Power Conference and the preceding Anglo-French talks, still feel that France's attitude is too uncompromising and shows no willingness to concede on Germany's demand for unconditional equality of status. Therefore, the future of the Anglo-French conference is predicted to be without any achievements. Currently, both government and opposition parties unanimously state that Germany must refuse to sign any treaty that does not recognize this fundamental principle. *Lokalanzeiger* goes further, stating that if the disarmament conference fails and the powerful nations with sufficient armaments fail to fulfill their promise to reduce armaments, then Germany has ample reason to freely exercise its sovereign right to protect its national defense.</p>
<h3 id="e60">White House Drafts Emergency Plan to Resolve Financial Crisis <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to Special Congressional Session Yesterday</p>
<p>Abandoning the Issuance of Scrip</p>
<p>Issuing New Currency to Aid the Currency Shortage</p>
<p>Fundamentally Reforming the Banking System</p>
<p>Reducing Government Spending to Balance the Budget</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 9th – President Roosevelt issued a statement regarding his consultation with congressional leaders, saying that he had discussed a carefully drafted plan that could save the situation and allow the nation's banking industry to resume operations. This legislation, once proposed, is assured of passage, and he is very pleased with the current situation.</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 9th – President Roosevelt, in consultation with congressional leaders at the White House last night, reportedly proposed a managed inflation plan to extend the payment moratorium until Congress enacts emergency legislation.</p>
<p>Reuter, New York, 9th – New York Governor Lehman announced today that the U.S. Treasury Department has rescinded the order to issue scrip.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 8th – After the U.S. Congress convenes in a special session tomorrow, the first step will be to establish a stable banking procedure to overcome this financial crisis. The second step will be to provide a more solid foundation for the entire banking structure. This was heard at President Roosevelt's meeting with congressional leaders tonight. Roosevelt's detailed plan has not yet been released. Only Democratic Senate Leader Robinson told reporters after the meeting that Congress would swiftly pass all emergency legislation without delay. According to information gathered from congressional leaders regarding the President's plan, it is expected that Roosevelt will ask Congress to temporarily grant him dictatorial powers to deal with the financial crisis, which may be even broader than the powers granted during wartime. He will also ask Congress to authorize the federal government to provide limited guarantees for bank deposits. The guaranteed amount will likely be equal to the percentage of withdrawals allowed to depositors by each bank before the President's moratorium announcement. It is said that this guarantee can reassure depositors and encourage them to return their hoarded money to the banks. In addition, it is expected that the President will ask Congress to authorize the continued embargo on currency exports, especially gold or gold certificates, until the President and the Treasury Department deem it safe to lift the embargo. After passing this emergency legislation, Congress will freely consider reforming the banking system. As for the best medium of exchange during this emergency period, the Treasury Department, on behalf of Congress, has decided to abandon the scrip clearinghouse plan and issue more banknotes.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 8th – Today, the U.S. government formally abandoned the use of scrip clearinghouse tickets or other money ticket plans and will use legal tender to deal with the current crisis. Treasury Secretary Woodin announced that the department is currently discussing detailed measures to issue more Federal Reserve banknotes, secured by gold and the liquid assets of member banks. He said, "We have now emerged from the clouds and see the light of day. The situation has largely stabilized and is no longer on the verge of collapse." However, Woodin did not mention when these additional banknotes could be issued, only saying that it would take several days to complete the government's plan to restore the banks to normalcy. He said that the events of the past forty-eight hours have proven that money tickets are not necessary to deal with the current situation and that existing currency can still be used to supply the banks. According to Treasury Department statistics, the elasticity of the Federal Reserve System has not reached its limit, and an additional 3 billion yuan of banknotes can still be issued without exceeding the legal ratio of gold reserves. The Treasury Department has instructed the Federal Reserve Banks to allow all 6,000 member banks to withdraw cash for wages and other regular business, provided that they submit all their gold certificates to the Federal Reserve Banks. The banking industry views this order as an indication that the government is determined to collect hoarded gold from the public on a large scale. In the past forty-eight hours, the Treasury Department has conducted a detailed investigation of the nation's financial reserves to determine where the currency shortage is most severe (i.e., lacking currency) so that it can be alleviated with the assistance of banks. It has also been found that the total amount of banknotes currently issued by the Federal Reserve Banks is far less than the allowable amount based on the legal cash reserve rate. The government can safely issue more banknotes without fear of danger, as Federal Reserve Bank notes are legally required to maintain only a 40% cash reserve, while the current cash reserve rate is 62%. On March 2nd, the total amount issued was 3,579,522,000 yuan, and the cash reserve was 2,268,462,000 yuan. Therefore, an additional 2 billion yuan can still be issued. In addition to the shortfall in issuance from the Federal Reserve Banks, there are other shortfalls that can be secured to provide sufficient currency to alleviate the current currency shortage.</p>
<p>Reuter, New York, 9th – This afternoon, Congress will hold a special session, and Roosevelt will present a straightforward and concise emergency legislative bill regarding the banking crisis. The gist of the bill is to use new currency to aid solvent banks while allowing insolvent banks to die of currency shortage. President Roosevelt will also propose actively reducing government spending to match revenue and put the government on a non-deficit footing. It is expected that Congress will pass a bill stipulating that banking for various commercial deposits is the responsibility of the federal government and that the government has the authority to charter and supervise banks. Judging from the current situation, Congress will definitely pass emergency procedures. It is believed that Congress's current actions are also closely related to future war debt negotiations. The attitude of Congress [Let Roosevelt do it] is encouraging. The printing bureau has been working day and night since Saturday to rush-print new banknotes in accordance with Roosevelt's currency expansion plan. These will be Federal Reserve banknotes, which are different from Federal Reserve notes that require a 40% cash reserve. According to Senator Glass, the new banknotes will have the same status as Treasury notes, backed by government bonds. Reuter, Washington, 8th – After consulting with representatives of grain exchanges in Chicago and other places, Bureau of Agricultural Economics Director Morganthau stated today that the meeting failed to agree on a method to reopen the grain exchanges. During the meeting, it was proposed that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics should release 30 million bushels of futures wheat to stabilize the operation of flour mills and the sale of flour, as flour mills are currently experiencing difficulties due to the lack of futures market hedging convenience. Morganthau also said that he believes a solution can be found in the future. Before the exchanges reopen, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics' 30,391,000 bushels of futures wheat cannot be sold in fact or in law. Today, efforts to reopen the grain exchanges before the banks resume operations have been abandoned, but meetings will still be held tomorrow to find an emergency solution to release the Bureau of Agricultural Economics' mostly May futures wheat so that flour mills can hedge their flour. It is reported that several flour mills have jointly purchased wheat stored by the Grain Stabilization Corporation from the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, totaling approximately 30 million bushels, but no official news about this matter has been heard yet.</p>
<p>=Currency Circulation Situation=</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 8th – When the Federal Reserve Board submitted a report on the nation's financial reserves to the Treasury Department, it also included a report on the circulation of various currencies, including: (A) Gold certificates (i.e., gold notes), fully backed by gold coins stored in the Treasury; (B) Silver certificates (i.e., silver notes), fully backed by standard silver dollars stored in the Treasury; (C) United States Notes, backed by 156,039,088 yuan of gold stored in the Treasury; (D) Treasury notes of 1890, some backed by the aforementioned gold stored in the Treasury, and some backed by standard silver dollars stored in the Treasury. These Treasury notes will be recalled and cancelled after being collected and will no longer be circulated, but some still remain in circulation; (E) Federal Reserve Bank notes, for which the nation has an obligation to redeem, are preferentially guaranteed by all assets of the issuing Reserve Bank. Borrowers must deposit an equivalent amount of cash or a portion of securities of equivalent value with the Federal Reserve Bank, and the Federal Reserve Bank must maintain a gold reserve of at least 40%. The Treasury Department stores legal tender within the Treasury to redeem all of these banknotes; (F) National bank (large banks with operations nationwide) circulation notes, which are backed by government bonds unless legal tender is stored in the Treasury for redemption. However, 5% of the legal tender must still be stored in the Treasury. When borrowing Federal Reserve Bank notes, member banks must deposit all their gold certificates with the Federal Reserve Bank. In peacetime, all banknotes are indistinguishable and circulate equally. Since the emergency order prohibiting cash flow was announced, there is no issue with national banknotes. In addition, there is very little difference in the actual use of various banknotes. The Treasury Department only accepts gold coins for tariffs, which can usually be paid from ordinary bank deposits. It is not yet known how this will be handled in the future. It is expected that various customs offices will accept Federal Reserve Bank notes, and some believe that the government will follow the old rules and force the public to withdraw their hoarded gold coins or gold certificates.</p>

<p>Reuter, New York, 9th – The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (Virginia) and other Federal Reserve Banks have been ordered by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington to report the names of those who withdrew cash after February 1st and failed to deposit it back by March 13th. It is expected that the authorities will force hoarders to redeposit their money in banks, otherwise they will be subject to heavy taxes and their names will be published.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Chronic Disease Becomes Acute Illness <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>9,000 U.S. Banks Closed in Three Years</p>
<p>The American financial panic is a chronic illness of the past three years. During this period, although there have been periods of temporary stability, the severity of the illness has only increased. In three years, as many as 5,096 banks have closed, with deposits exceeding 32,866,510,000 U.S. dollars, averaging 6.44 million U.S. dollars per bank. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Year Number of Banks Monthly Average Total Deposits</p>
<p>Closed</p>
<p>1930 1,345 22 864,715 [thousands]</p>
<p>1931 2,298 192 1,691,510</p>
<p>1932 1,453 121 730,426</p>
<p>Total 5,096 3,286,651</p>
<p>From the above analysis, most of the closed banks are small banks, but the public has suffered losses of 320 billion yuan. Although not all deposits are lost due to closure, the public has felt very uneasy and has withdrawn their deposits, either hoarding them at home or transferring them to large banks or remitting them to foreign banks. Therefore, in December of last year, 153 banks closed, and in January of this year, the number exceeded 200. Moreover, it is widely rumored abroad that Roosevelt will adopt a gold ban policy after taking office, which has further prompted the public to transfer funds and deposit them in British and French banks.

<p>United News Agency, Osaka, 9th – Japanese industrialist Shimauchi Tokuzo was arrested again this morning by the Osaka Military Police and interrogated for three hours on charges of selling salt. He was released at six o'clock. According to the Military Police, although the main actor in the salt selling case is Kyuzo Otsuka, most of the capital was provided by Shimauchi Tokuzo, in three installments of 50,000, 30,000, and 5,000 yuan, remitted from the Bank of Korea to Dalian and handed over to Otsuka. After this incident, Osaka's general industrialists were very dissatisfied, saying that salt is a common commodity and can be exported freely, and is not among the prohibited items. The Military Police's behavior is detrimental to the future of the industrial sector.</p>

<p>Reuter, Marseille – A 60-year-old man here was arrested for repeatedly begging on the street. After a police investigation, it was found that the old man was not poor and owned a four-story building and many gumball machines in various hotels. During the interrogation, he said that although he was nominally a rich man, he was actually very distressed because the tenants owed him a lot of rent, while the property tax could not be delayed. Therefore, for the sake of paying taxes, he had no choice but to beg. After the trial, the judge sentenced the old man to eight months in prison and said, "You can have no worries for these eight months." The old man replied, "No, no, my tenants will take the opportunity to not pay rent for eight months."</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Strategic Significance of the Japanese Navy's Grand Maneuvers in the Eyes of the Japanese (By Masanori Ito) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>One: The Origin of the Grand Maneuvers</p>
<p>The atmospheric pressure on both sides of the Pacific Ocean has deviated from the norm. Although it has not yet reached the level of a "storm," a strong wind continues to stir the emotions of the people on both shores. At this very moment, the US Navy's grand maneuvers have begun. Is this preparation for war against Japan? Most people harbor such doubts and feel a sense of agitation toward the Atlantic fleet stationed in the Pacific. On the other hand, Japan's naval grand maneuvers this year have also expanded in scope. This news of expansion has been interpreted as preparation for war against the League of Nations and a demonstration against the United States, causing agitation among people on the other shore.</p>
<p>Formally, both sides are suspicious of each other because the confrontation of the maneuvers is a fact. And this fact is the object of doubt. Originally, it is appropriate for fleets to come together through maneuvers. To suspect each other because of this is rather absurd. Coming together symbolizes peace, while suspicion is the seed of preparation for war. Although humanity loves peace, the current situation seems to be unconsciously tilting toward war preparations. This is a reality in the relationship between Japan and the United States. The following is a reflection of the international political situation, such as the United States' suspicion that Japan intended to occupy China during the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents. Stimson's diplomacy was based on this suspicion. As a result, Japan also deeply suspected that the United States was preparing for war against Japan. International discourse also became tense. And the suspicion of the United States deepened even further. This reciprocal suspicion is the reality on both sides of the Pacific. Just as this unconscious atmosphere had calmed down, the grand maneuvers of Japan and the United States were held one after the other. This naturally added fuel to the fire of suspicion before the ashes had even cooled. Ultimately, is the US Navy's exercise worthy of vigilance? Is Japan's naval exercise worthy of suspicion?</p>
<p>Two: Strategy and Tactics</p>
<p>Ignorance often leads to misunderstanding, and misunderstanding often leads to war. Unconscious judgment of international affairs or half-understood commentary on such matters often contain dangerous elements. Misunderstandings between the people of both countries regarding the naval relationship between Japan and the United States will at least lead to danger in the fact of the arms race.</p>
<p>If the purpose of the US maneuvers is clearly preparation for war against Japan, then we must certainly make thorough preparations. If Japan's maneuvers are truly a hypothetical battle against... then the suspicions of the United States are naturally not unreasonable. If Japan's maneuvers are held because it is planning to withdraw from the League of Nations, planning to refuse to return..., and planning to fight alone when allied forces use force to seize it, then the suspicion has some reason. However, Japanese naval commanders, in fact, are not currently thinking of going to war with the world. Therefore, there are no such maneuvers as mentioned above at present. However, should our perspective on the US naval maneuvers be sharp or dull? Naturally, neither a sharp nor a dull one-sided observation will reveal its truth. Therefore, here, the author first offers two concepts:</p>
<p>(1) The political significance of the US Navy's grand maneuvers. (2) Its tactical significance.</p>
<p>The above two points are derived from observing the horizontal plane. If we look further, we can also derive two concepts:</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>(A) A test of the existing power of the US Navy maneuvers and a strategic indication.</p>
<p>(B) Demands for the future.</p>
<p>Three: The Grand Maneuvers</p>
<p>The duration of this exercise is approximately seventy days, from January 23, when the scouting force/Atlantic Fleet (Scouting Force, US Fleet) departed from San Pedro, California, to March 31, the day the US Fleet's entire combined tactical exercise concludes. However, the scouting force and the battle force (Battle Force) had already begun preparations at their bases on January 1. Therefore, starting from January 1, it can also be said to be ninety days. Participants are almost all of the US Navy. The exercise is divided into three phases:</p>
<p>Exercise Objective Period Participating Forces</p>
<p>Phase 1: Hawaii Attack and Defense Exercise (Joint Exercise) From January 23 to February 5 Attacking: Scouting Force, Defending: Hawaii Land and Sea Forces</p>
<p>Phase 2: Occupation of Base Exercise (Fleet Problem) From February 6 to February 17 Attacking: Scouting Force, Defending: Battle Force</p>
<p>Phase 3: Combined Training of the Grand Fleet (Fleet Concentration) From February 18 to March 31 Entire US Fleet</p>
<p>From the above table, the battlefields for attack and defense in the exercises are all islands and bases. Compared with ordinary exercises that focus solely on naval gunfire and torpedo tactics on the sea surface, this is not only more diverse in style but also very interesting. This will be described in detail below. This type of exercise has extremely important tactical significance for the air force. Not only naval authorities of various countries around the world but also people who care about the navy should pay serious attention.</p>
<p>What kind of tactical lessons will be learned from this? We can see its record in April. However, some of the more interesting tactics can be guessed at now. For example, the commonly reported use of "colored water columns" from the main guns to test the mutual distance of various ships, which can be considered an interesting thing in the third phase of the exercise. In addition, new tactics such as firing "long-range illuminating shells" during night battles to observe enemy ships and shield oneself while attacking the enemy are also interesting. And the battle for the attack and defense of Hawaii is a reflection and realistic portrayal of the Shanghai battle, making it even more interesting. The above points will be discussed in the following. Now, let's first study the so-called political and strategic significances.</p>
<p>Four: Testing Offensive and Defensive Capabilities</p>
<p>The first question that people generally have about this exercise is whether it is offensive or defensive. What I call "political significance" mainly refers to this point. The so-called political significance refers to strategy. The strategy of peacetime exercises can greatly reflect political or diplomatic actions. Because strategy is an integral part of national policy. Policy going left and strategy going right is not only theoretically unacceptable but also clumsy and useless in practice. Therefore, the direction of policy and the trend of diplomacy can be tested to a certain extent from the methods adopted in the naval grand maneuvers.</p>
<p>Of course, the goal of the exercise is indefinite, and it is not possible to conduct hypothetical battles with the same force on the same sea surface every year. Although the battle tactics are only slightly different, the strategic background is definitely not the same. Assuming that the strategy is changed every year, it is something that should naturally be done in exercises. The impact on the assumed enemy country is also definitely not the same. In other words, a subjective, unintentional strategy can be objectively recognized as an intentional strategic goal.</p>
<p>However, this subtle psychology, because of the different background of the times, is sometimes激昂, but sometimes it will also be calm. Therefore, the observation of the offensive and defensive issue of the purpose of the exercise and the judgment of the trend of national policy naturally shift according to the development of the situation. Therefore, after Stimson revised his diplomatic policy, the relationship between Japan and the United States gradually eased. Compared with this time last year, the degree of cold and heat is no longer the same. The feelings of the people have also relaxed a lot. However, the clouds of suspicion are still shrouding the area. It has not yet reached the point of clearing up after the rain. The increasing number of people who want to hear a detailed discussion of the US grand maneuvers proves that people's hearts are still floating.</p>
<p>In fact, as in the previous exercise around Panama, taking Japan as a hypothetical enemy country and assuming that the canal was bombed by the Japanese air force, so that the US main fleet and cruiser fleet could not take care of each other and were trapped in an isolated and helpless state, they did feel this kind of exercise was interesting. But Japan had to pay attention to this exercise to speculate on the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>Five: Speculation on the Defensive</p>
<p>First, let's calmly observe this exercise. We seem to feel that the US exercise is defensive. First, assuming that Hawaii has been occupied by the enemy, the US Navy starts its offensive from Hawaii. How passively does this kind of strategy indicate? Second, the warships that counterattack Hawaii do not use the main fleet but the cruiser fleet. Compared with previous exercises, this is also a passive indication. Third, the second phase of the exercise is exclusively aimed at defending the country's base. This is a manifestation of defensiveness. Fourth, the defense force of the base is the main battleship fleet, which is an even more obvious manifestation of "defensiveness."</p>
<p>Originally, attack and defense are like two sides of a shield, which cannot be separated. One must attack to defend, and one must defend to attack. Therefore, the two words attack and defense, apart from being distinguishable in concept, cannot be separated strategically. The famous general Mahan once said that even if a strategy is defensive, the fleet must always take the offensive.</p>
<p>If these two sentences are observed from within, then sometimes the fleet takes offensive operations, but the strategy is defensive. However, the exercise is a peacetime strategy and a peacetime tactic. If we look at the purpose of the exercise as described above, then we might as well say that the US peacetime outlook and tactics are defensive. This strategy is contrary to the traditional policy of the United States, that is, avoiding stimulating expressions in the relationship between Japan and the United States and considering it from a far-reaching conscious perspective. We know that the US military is intensifying the practice of free attacks, but this kind of guerrilla-style free attack is more than enough to guard against the enemy, but it is insufficient for formal combat.</p>
<p>The author has good feelings about the US naval maneuvers. Apart from Secretary of State Stimson, the author also respects Admiral Pratt. I respect his wisdom and brilliance. If it is a fact that Stimson wanted to start a war with Japan, then Pratt's prevention was an even greater fact. The scale of the 1932 grand maneuvers was all a realistic portrayal of Admiral Pratt's concept.</p>
<p>Six: The Naval Balance between Japan and the United States</p>
<p>Stimson initially understood Japan a little, but after the Jinzhou incident, he changed his mentality, and his anti-Japanese feelings deepened. Finally, he raised the "question of whether it is possible to wage war against Japan" and immediately answered "no." This was Admiral Pratt.</p>
<p>Regarding the so-called judgment of the situation—a strategic element that the US Navy has recently attached great importance to, Estimation of Situation—Pratt has surpassed American politicians. The admiral once said that whether strategically or in terms of military strength, naval battles between Japan and the United States are unfavorable, at least useless. Now, he wants to avoid war as much as possible and discover the value of the navy outside of war.</p>
<p>The scale and purpose of this exercise are almost the same as described above. The deployment and selection of offensive and defensive forces everywhere make it clear at a glance that it comes from a "defensive" perspective. Some people may doubt that this is a smokescreen to appease Japan. Those who doubt can continue to doubt. The author believes in it extremely. There is only one thing we must know. The Japanese Navy is able to exist because it possesses its current strength. If the Japanese Navy's strength were half of what it is now, perhaps the war between Japan and the United States would have started long ago. And Japan's Far East policy might be subject to restraint and suppression. Japan might have surrendered long before the war started.</p>
<p>Americans will naturally not shed blood for the Far East issue, but if Admiral Pratt answered Stimson's question with "victory is possible" (the ratio of strength between Japan and the United States is four to ten), then the fact would be either a war between Japan and the United States or Japan's surrender.</p>
<p>The current power of the United States is more than enough to defend its own country, but not enough to attack Japan. The current strength of the Japanese Navy is sufficient to resist the attack of any country. In other words, in terms of the position of the United States attacking and Japan defending, the naval forces of Japan and the United States are evenly matched. They cannot invade each other. The essence and value of armaments are all here.</p>
<p>If Japan did not have this kind of strength, it would naturally be difficult to recognize Manchuria and to claim to be the master of upholding peace in the Far East. Because it has this kind of power, it maintains the peace between Japan and the United States. Soldiers may be willing to fight, but our people have already recognized the value of the navy winning without fighting. The US exercise is also recognized as defensive, and the atmospheric pressure in diplomatic relations has gradually calmed down.</p>

<p>An "Emperor" Appears in Guanyang County</p>
<p>Massive Construction of Altars and Conferring of Generals</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Yongming and Daoxian Counties, under the jurisdiction of Hunan Province, and Xing'an and Guanyang Counties, under the jurisdiction of Guangxi Province, are connected by continuous mountains, which have always been inhabited by Yao ethnic groups. For decades, they have lived in peace, and many have been assimilated. Recently, the Yao people in Guanyang suddenly rioted, ostensibly holding a religious festival in Tongmujiang (under the jurisdiction of Guanyang County), gathering thousands of people, claiming that an emperor had been born, and threatening to invade Yongming and Daoxian Counties in Hunan. The county magistrates of Yongming and Dao County have reported to the Provincial Government by telegram. He Jian not only sent Ou Guan to lead troops to suppress them but also telegraphed the Guangxi Provincial Government to send troops to suppress them together, so as to avoid further disturbances. The telegrams from the two counties are as follows: (1) County Magistrate Yuan Tie-geng of Yongming County telegraphed: (According to reports, Yao bandits are currently holding a religious festival in Guanyang County, claiming that an emperor has been born. The emperor's name is Feng Tianshunqi, and his title is Fengtian Chu. His younger brother, Feng Caishun, is also known as Fuling and is currently being held in Quanzhou. His elder brother, Feng Kunlun, is a Taoist priest in Wang Futang's house in Aijia, Guanyang County. The location of the festival is Tongmujiang, Shaluoyuan, under the jurisdiction of Guanyang County, with thousands of people, and they have conferred the titles of four generals: Su, Hou, Xun, and Li. People who join the association must pay a fee of one yuan or several yuan. They claim that the thousands of people only need one dou of rice a day. The cooking method is that it is cooked immediately and never runs out. In the future, when they become the emperor of the whole country, everyone will be promoted and enjoy peace together. The office urgently telegraphed the Guanyang County Government for investigation and then approved a reply by telegram, stating that Yao bandits were gathering to stir up trouble and were currently dispatching troops to suppress them, fearing that the Yao people in the border areas would be deceived by them, please strengthen vigilance. The office secretly investigated</p>
<h3 id="e72">Imperial Tang Emperor Ming's Mountain Sacrifice Jade Tablets <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Discovered at the Foot of Mount Tai</p>
<p>An Unprecedented and Unique Treasure</p>
<p>Tai'an Dispatch: Mount Tai in Tai'an, Shandong, is the most revered of the Five Sacred Mountains. Emperors of all dynasties performed Feng and Shan sacrifices there. All the gold, stone, and ritual implements used are of great significance to Chinese history and culture. However, after use, they were often carefully and secretly stored to show respect for Mount Tai. Since the Tang Dynasty, no such sacrificial items have been discovered. Recently, it was rumored that Jade Tablets with sacrificial text and other jade objects used by Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty during his Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai were discovered in Tai'an. It is said that when the discovery was made, Tai'an was garrisoned by a certain army, so everything was taken by that army. Later, when that army withdrew from Shandong, the treasures were also transported to Beiping (Beijing). A special investigation into the situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>Location of the Treasure: At the foot of Mount Tai, north of Tai'an Railway Station on the Jinpu Railway, there is a small mountain called Songli Mountain. On the mountain, there is a Temple of the King of Hell (阎王庙), and in front of the temple, there is a pagoda. The construction date of the pagoda cannot be determined, but it is known to be from the Tang Dynasty. During the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), both the temple and the pagoda on the mountain were destroyed by artillery fire. When a certain army garrisoned Tai'an, they sent soldiers to clear away the remaining bricks and tiles on the mountain and build a memorial碑 on the original site of the pagoda. It now stands tall and majestic. Passengers traveling on the Jinpu Railway can see it from a dozen miles away. Unsuspecting observers would never imagine that precious treasures were discovered beneath this pagoda.</p>
<p>Discovery Process: When the army was clearing the pagoda, intending to rebuild the memorial碑, they first dug up the remaining bricks of the pagoda's foundation. Unexpectedly, under the base of the pagoda, they discovered five-color earth, similar to the form of the Temple of Heaven (天地坛) in Beiping. The soil was in the shape of a square, with red, white, blue, and black colors on the four sides and yellow in the center (as shown in the diagram).</p>
<p>White Digging soldiers, seeing that the soil</p>
<p>Red Yellow Black was of a special nature, immediately reported it to their</p>
<p>Blue highest officer. Upon hearing the report, the officer knew that there must be treasures buried beneath. He ordered further excavation, with soldiers rotated daily to prevent the news from leaking out. During the excavation within the red, white, blue, and black soils, a large number of jade objects were unearthed. Upon examination of the inscriptions, all were sacrificial items used by Emperor Ming (Xuanzong) of the Tang Dynasty during the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Exquisite Jade Tablets: Later, within the yellow soil, a stone box, five feet square, was unearthed. The carvings on the outside of the box were extremely intricate. Upon opening the stone box, another gold box was found inside. The floral engravings on the gold box were even more mysterious and beyond description with words. Inside the gold box, there were fifteen white jade plates, arranged side by side. Each plate was about one foot long and two inches wide, connected by gold threads. Each plate was engraved with the script form of the Tang Emperor Ming's inscription placed at Mount Tai. By reading the text on the fifteen plates together, it was discovered to be the sacrificial text of Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty's Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai. The words and phrases of the sacrificial text were particularly exquisite. Thus, it was proven to be the sacrificial items buried after the Feng sacrifice of Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty. The army commander ordered strict secrecy, collected and stored the items. Now that the army has withdrawn from Shandong for a long time, these antiques have long been transported to Beiping. Some of the soldiers who dug the earth at that time did not leave with the army, and recently, when they talked about this matter, the outside world learned the details.</p>
<p>(Value of the Antiquities): According to archaeologists in Tai'an, this ancient artifact is an unprecedented discovery. The plates inside the gold box on which the sacrificial text is engraved are the ancient jade tablets. Although the existence of jade tablets has been known in modern times, no one has ever seen them. Its importance lies in that, on one hand, it can be used to study the ancient Feng and Shan sacrificial rituals at Mount Tai, and on the other hand, it can reveal the form of ancient writing slips. It is extremely related to Chinese history and culture, and its value is far beyond any ancient artifact discovered in the past. (March 7th)</p>
<p>The county borders Guilin on three sides, and the Yao people are numerous and have little knowledge, making them easily incited. Recently, rumors have been circulating daily. In Yongming, the rumor is that the Yao bandits of Guanyang will arrive in Yongming soon. In Guanyang, the rumor is that there are two or three thousand Yao bandits in Yongming who will attack Guanyang soon. In addition to ordering the teams to defend key areas and instructing the local militia in the border areas to inform the Yao people not to believe the rumors and to investigate and guard against them at any time, we should earnestly request the dispatch of troops to the county to assist in defense and suppression, and await further instructions. (2) County Magistrate Wu. County Magistrate Huang Kunshan, Republican Commander, heard that there are over two thousand Yao bandits in Yongming County, and they threaten to disrupt Daoxian and Guanyang County. Please clarify the actual situation and respond accordingly. We have already telegraphed the County Magistrate of Yongming and requested the local security to send officers for close investigation and teams for suppression. Now, we enclose the copies of reports from all parties as follows: (1) The Yao bandits in Guanyang, Xing'an and Quanan counties have agreed to rise up, incited by communists who are trying to communize the Yao people. (2) There are many Yao bandits in Xing'an, but few have guns, most wielding knives and clubs. They have already engaged with the local militia. The bandits are organized into teams of ten or more, brandishing knives and spears, charging one after another. (3) The Yao bandits from Quanan County have already broken out of Jianxiang and are currently engaging with the local militia. (4) The Yao bandits in Guanyang have broken out of Shaluoyuan, about twenty miles from the county seat. The militia fired upon them, killing many bandits, with no casualties on the militia side. (5) The above three locations are currently stalemated between soldiers and bandits. Fortunately, the bandits are weak and have not been able to achieve much. In addition to ordering the local militia and coordinating with the local security to send teams for strict defense and suppression, we hereby telegraph this report for your review. (March 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Improving Security Corps Organization and Training in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>First-class counties must draw up at least three companies of security forces. Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Government's 567th Commission meeting passed the following measures to improve the organization and training of the province's security corps: (1) Establish a Houserolder (户长) under the current existing Qu (區), Tuan (圑), Jia (甲) and Pai (牌) levels of the security corps. (2) If the county has completed its autonomy and the Qu, Xiang (鄉), Zhen (鎮) and Lu (閭) can be responsible, the heads of Qu, Tuan, Jia and Pai should also serve concurrently. Otherwise, they should be elected in order, but this is not limited to those with military knowledge. (3) The responsibilities of the Qu, Xiang, Zhen, Lu and the Qu, Jia and Pai should be clearly divided. All matters that should be handled by the autonomous organs but are the responsibility of the Baojia (保甲) should be handled by the Security Corps. The original tasks of the Security Corps remain unchanged. (4) The mutual security pledge should be based on the Lu unit. The old mutual security pledge for each household of the same Jia is abolished. (5) Universal training should be based on the Jia unit and held once a year during the agricultural slack season. The training period is limited to three months. (6) Centralized training: The head of the General Corps should draw up strong men from each Jia to be trained in the county for six months. After their discharge, they will be responsible for the universal training of their original Jia. (7) Strong men registered in the registers should be called Strong Men's Teams (壯丁隊), strong men in the universal training should be called Regular Teams (常備隊), and strong men in the centralized training should be called Security Teams (保衛隊). (8) First-class counties must draw up at least three companies of security forces every six months, second-class counties two companies, and third-class counties one company. Each company should have ninety soldiers. (9) The funds required for universal training and centralized training should be budgeted by each county and submitted to the province for approval.

<p>Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits in Jiaodiaowan</p>
<p>Jiaodiaowan Township in the county has many rivers and harbors, making it an area where bandits frequent. The night before last, a bandit boat was discovered there, sailing from the west. It contained three bandits, each carrying a Mauser pistol. It was rumored that there was also a hostage on board. Fan Shaolin, an investigator from the Second Squad of the First District of the Provincial Public Security Team stationed there, spotted the boat and led the police to pursue it. When they reached the Yang Bridge at number thirty-eight, the bandit boat opened fire to resist arrest. Outnumbered, the bandits quickly sailed away. The police boat was unable to pursue due to the darkness and returned empty-handed.</p>

<p>Accomplices of Taibao Ashu Arrested</p>
<p>Qi Xingxiong, Qi Xingyou, Wu Shaoquan, accomplices of Taibao Ashu, the leader of the Pudong gang, as well as suspects Yang Jinsong, Wang Awu, Sun Aliu, Yang Shoumei, etc., were recently arrested by Xu Pucheng, the district chief of the First District of the Water Police, at Hujiaqiao in Songjiang. They were escorted to Suzhou on the 8th and handed over to the Suzhou-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Command for interrogation. That evening, they were interrogated by the Inspector General. According to Qi Xingxiong's confession, when Taibao Ashu started his gang in Hujiaqiao, I, along with my brothers Qi Xingyou, Arong, and Achang, joined the gang. Later, when Taibao Ashu was executed, the gang disbanded. On December 22nd of last year, Arong led Qi Ayou, Afu Lin, Wu Shaoquan, Hobbling Azhao, Pockmarked Afu, etc., to rob the families of Lu and Lu Xunyan in Changbang Village, Songjiang, and kidnapped two men. When the boat arrived at the temple, the hostage was taken away by Little Arong, and later the hostage was released. They stole 300 yuan in silver, which was used for food. Each of the brothers received five yuan, etc. After interrogating Ma Xingyou and Wu Shaoquan once, they were ordered to be returned to custody pending verification. However, Yang Jinsong, etc., denied communicating with the bandits.</p>
<p>Tomb-Sweeping Boat Robbed in Shihu</p>
<p>The Zhu family, residing in Hulongdai, hired a boat to go to Zhangjiaqiao in Suzhou County to sweep tombs on the morning of the 9th. Unexpectedly, when the boat passed near Shihu, it was suddenly encountered by a bandit boat with four bandits who boarded the boat and robbed them. They were robbed of jewelry and clothing worth about 200 yuan. Also, the Wang Zhaofu family in Fengjiaqiao, Hengtang, was robbed by bandits on the morning of the 8th, losing clothing and silver worth about 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Telephone Bureau Expands Numbers and Consolidates Deposits</p>
<p>Since Director Deng Sixiao took office at the Suzhou Telephone Bureau, the total number of switchboard numbers has been full and materials are lacking, so registered users have not been able to add installations. To increase the expansion, there are economic difficulties. It has been found that users who install telephones should pay a deposit fee. Most have not paid enough according to regulations, and some have not paid at all. In order to ensure uniformity, a consolidation method has been drafted and the funds collected will be used for expansion projects. An order was submitted to the ministry for approval, and the ministry approved an order for the Wu County Chamber of Commerce to assist in order to facilitate the process. The county chamber of commerce, due to the decline of the market and the exhaustion of the economy, requested a delay. The original approval of the Ministry of Transportation is recorded below. It is noted that the increase in telephone rent in the 19th year (1930) was based on precise statistics by the ministry. After the full amount of salary increases for employees, the monthly rent for Suzhou telephones should have increased by an average of two yuan and eight jiao to meet the business principles. The determined increase of two yuan was originally intended to maintain the telephone business while also considering the difficulties of merchants. A notice was issued to the former Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce in Order No. 1016 of the 19th year. Later, due to the Chamber's repeated requests, the increase of two yuan was temporarily reduced by half, and Directive No. 453 of the 19th year ordered that it should be temporarily paid as such. Once the merchants' difficulties eased slightly, it should still be increased accordingly. The former General Chamber of Commerce requested that the funds from the rent increase be retained by former Director Zhao for expansion projects. Although former Director Zhao forwarded the request to the Ministry, the Ministry did not approve it because the ministry was not familiar with the status of the telephone. However, the former approval states that even if the Chamber of Commerce was notified by former Director Zhao, there is no need to follow this case because when the charter is created, the charter is terminated. Furthermore, according to the bureau's report, after the notice to collect deposits was sent out this time, many have come to the bureau to pay them. It would not be fair if for the same users in the city, the deposits collected have different weights and measures. In summary, the reason for collecting deposits this time is that the bureau's numbers are full and the telephone funds are extremely stretched. For the local population and for the important consideration of raising funds for the expansion project, it is necessary to implement the revised charter and use all the funds collected by the bureau. The funds have been ordered to be deposited in the Bank of China and a special account has been established for expansion needs. The ministry is cautious in this regard. It wants to provide convenience to the citizens of Suzhou and does not want to increase the burden on the citizens of Suzhou. Therefore, it does not collect the full two yuan increase as originally planned but only orders the deposit charter to be paid in full, so that they can be returned in full when the time comes. It is considerate of the merchants' difficulties. Furthermore, the name of the deposit has been changed to Deposit Fee according to the new charter revised in January of this year. It includes a deposit for the machine and a guarantee of rent, which is broader than the former term of Deposit only. Therefore, the addition of the deposit is of course reasonable. The previous instructions to notify the merchants to pay according to the charter shall still be followed. The previous statement to delay is difficult to approve. This batch.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Suspicious White Russian Actions Are Treacherous</p>
<p>At five o'clock in the afternoon the day before yesterday, six White Russians suddenly arrived at the railway station in this county. They were wearing crisp suits, one wearing a raincoat, and no other belongings. Two of them spoke fluent mandarin. After getting off the train, they went to the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company to inquire about the situation in Jiangyin. They then bought tickets and took a bus to Cheng. After arriving in Cheng, the Cheng authorities, considering the current serious situation and the tight defense of the Yangtze River, suspected that the White Russian's actions were treacherous and placed them under surveillance. Yesterday morning, they were escorted back to Xi and interrogated severely by Zhu Shou, the chief of the Sixth Branch of the County Public Security Bureau. The White Russians claimed to be a song and dance troupe. A Republic of China passport issued by the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 20th year (1931) was found on them, but it did not have the words for traveling to various ports in the interior. Later, Chief Zhu sent police officers and Qian, an official from the County Party Headquarters, to escort them onto the train and expel them from Xi.</p>
<p>Actively Promoting the New Weights and Measures</p>
<p>The county government of this county has ordered inspectors to actively promote the new weights and measures system. They will persuade various industries to use new equipment to avoid chaos in the market and to achieve uniformity. However, due to the lack of procedures, the various industries have not yet adopted it uniformly. The industries that have already switched to the new system are tea, tea leaves, oil mills, oil merchants, paint industry, coal, coal and iron, silk cloth, ready-made clothing, dried goods, lime merchants, candles, noodle restaurants, cloth factories, and vegetable markets. On the surface, the industries have been ordered to switch to the new system, but they are secretly using the old equipment. Inspectors Tang Fuqian and He Heming, in accordance with the inspection rules, led police officers to conduct inspections in various districts starting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 9th). If old equipment is found, it will be confiscated. Inspections will continue daily without interruption. As for the food industry, after persuasion, they obeyed the order to switch to the new system. However, due to the new equipment not yet being manufactured and the need to wait for the implementation of rice and grain, the industry has finished manufacturing the Sheng and Dou measures and sent them to the county government for inspection. It has been decided that they will start using them on the 20th of this month. The industry association will notify the members to collect them. The mountain goods industry specially convened a meeting of urban and rural members the day before yesterday to discuss the implementation method. It was decided that the retail and wholesale scales should be switched to the new system within the shortest possible time. As for the Sheng and Dou measures used by the warehouses in the urban area and various towns and villages to collect rent rice, they should purchase new equipment from the grain industry association to avoid fraud.</p>

<p>Bandits Attempt to Kidnap Child, Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Hua Lao Wu's seven-year-old daughter in Damiao Alley, Wuyi County, returned home with her mother in a private carriage from the Qi family at around 5 p.m. on the 7th. When she got out of the car and entered the door, a bandit suddenly grabbed the girl, intending to escape. The mother was terrified and shouted for help. Seeing the situation was not good, the bandit abandoned the child and left. Afterwards, the Hua family recalled receiving threatening letters from bandits last year, instructing them to send money to a certain place in Xihonglin, otherwise they would come and kidnap the child. It is believed that the person who attempted to kidnap the child this time was the bandit. Also, the young son of the Zhou family in Yuansheng Silver Shop on Gulou Street was taken to the street by his nanny to visit the street that evening. A bandit also stepped forward to forcibly snatch the child. Fortunately, the nanny saw the opportunity and twisted the bandit, snatched the child back. The bandit also escaped in the meantime.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Implementation of Silver Dollar Standard Begins Today <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Money Dealers Announce Resolutions to Members</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange to be Calculated in Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Silver-Taels Exchange to Open for Business</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has decided to implement the silver dollar standard from today. Transactions in all industries will be calculated in silver dollars, with a fixed rate of seven qian, one fen and five li as the legal price. The money industry held an extraordinary meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the measures. Foreign exchange transactions in the banking industry will be calculated in silver dollars. The exchange mechanism jointly established by the Central Bank and two other banks will start business at 9:00 a.m. today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Money Dealers' Announcement)</p>
<p>The Money Dealers' Association notified its members yesterday, stating, "To: All Members, This is to inform you that on the 8th of this month, an extraordinary meeting of members' representatives was held to discuss matters starting from March 10th.

(B) Regarding foreign matters: (1) All bills from local industries and banks, as well as foreign banks, will be handled in the same way as silver bills. (2) Foreign banks will be charged a handling fee of one jiao per thousand yuan for banknotes or silver dollars. (3) Existing bill discounts for all correspondents will continue to be handled as before. The above items have been resolved and recorded. Please comply accordingly."</p>
<p>(Banking Reform Measures)</p>
<p>Those in the banking industry who manage foreign exchange,</p>
<p>such as US dollars, francs, yen, Hong Kong dollars, rupees, new dollars, marks, Dutch guilders, pounds, etc., which were originally calculated in silver taels, have decided to convert to silver dollars at the fixed rate of seven qian, one fen and five li from today. The exchange rate committee organized by the Banking Association will stop sending telegrams reporting the foreign exchange rates and exchange rates in various places from today. The method will be determined based on local market needs, as exchange rates fluctuate. However, the Central Bank's foreign exchange has already been converted to silver dollars.</p>
<p>(Silver-Taels Exchange Opens)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silver Dollar and Silver Taels Exchange Management Committee, jointly established by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, has been designated by the three banks to be composed of Tang Min, Li Jue, and Xi Demao from the Central Bank; Bei Songsun and Shi Jiu from the Bank of China; and Qin Zuze and Chen Jun from the Bank of Communications. The organizational outline has been promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and the detailed rules of procedure have been discussed and approved. It will start business today. The exchange office is located in the Cashier Section of the Business Bureau on the first floor of the Central Bank. The office is located on the third floor of the Central Bank. Yang Xiaobo, the deputy director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, will serve concurrently as the secretary, and four clerks will be assigned to the exchange duties. All who wish to exchange silver taels for silver dollars or silver dollars for silver taels must fill out a request form. After the approval notice is issued, they can exchange at the designated bank. Office hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. However, the request form must be submitted before 2:00 p.m. daily, and the approval notice will be issued at 3:00 p.m. on the same day.</p>
<p>(Municipal Government Order to Comply)</p>
<p>The Municipal Government approved the Ministry of Finance's consultation and issued an order yesterday to implement the silver dollar standard, stating, "To: All to be carried out, In response to the Ministry of Finance's Qian Zi No. 5988 consultation stating, the Ministry of Finance, in preparation for the abolition of taels, will first implement it in Shanghai, and has stipulated that the commonly used silver taels and silver dollar standard coins of one yuan in the Shanghai market, or old silver coins of one yuan with the original fixed weight and fineness, will be calculated at a fixed conversion rate of seven qian, one fen and five li per standard tael, equivalent to one silver coin, which will take effect from March 10th of this year, as announced by the Ministry. All public and private payments, settlement of debts and credits, and all transactions and various taxes should be collected and paid in silver coins according to the aforementioned fixed rate, in order to unify the system. In addition to submitting a request to the Executive Yuan to submit it to the National Government for record, and issuing separate consultations, we hereby consult your Municipal Government to investigate and order all subordinates to comply accordingly. This order."</p>
<p>(Conversion to Dollars)</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with leaders of the silver money industry yesterday. According to them, after the implementation of the silver dollar standard, the funds of all correspondents that are calculated in silver taels will remain the same. All correspondents who need silver taels tickets can still open them as before. As for the delivery of goods by foreign firms and the payment of various fees, which used to be in silver taels, they can be paid in silver coins at the fixed legal price. Because in the past, those who received silver taels often arbitrarily increased or decreased the dollar rate to profit from the conversion, but now that the price of silver taels is fixed and the dollar has been abolished, there should be no problem.</p>
<p>(Factory Bars Replace Silver Ingots)</p>
<p>Since the Central Mint began minting new coins on March 1st, silver ingots are bound to be eliminated. It is heard that the Mint has decided to issue factory bars, with a fixed weight and fineness, each bar worth one thousand yuan, to replace silver ingots. In the future, the inventories of the silver money industry will all be converted to factory bars. The current number of silver ingots in this city is approximately 230 million taels.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Jiang Zuobin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Says He Will Report Everything to the Capital in the Coming Days</p>
<p>For the Time Being, He Is Not Prepared to Express Anything</p>
<p>Whether He Returns to Japan Will Depend on the Government's Orders</p>
<p>The resident ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, and his wife, along with embassy secretary Ding Shaoji and two attendants, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 1:00 AM aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Cleveland from Japan. The ship was moored at the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong. Due to the late hour, the Dollar Steamship Lines' ferry only departed from the New Customs Wharf at 7:00 AM yesterday morning to pick up passengers. The municipal government specially dispatched Commissioner Wang Changchun, Councilor Yin Rugeng, and Secretary Tang Shi at 6:30 AM this morning aboard a police bureau boat to Pudong to welcome them. At 8:15 AM,</p>
<h3 id="e77">Ambassador Jiang, Who Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning (Left) (Li Zunyong) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Jiang boarded the welcoming boat and landed at the New Customs Wharf. Central Committee member Zhang Qun and Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang of the Foreign Affairs Office were also at the wharf to greet them. Mr. Jiang then returned to his residence on Lafayette Road in the same car as Zhang Qun. This newspaper's reporter went to visit him this morning. According to Mr. Jiang, regarding the Sino-Japanese issue and everything else, he is not prepared to express anything until he has gone to the capital and conferred with the government. When asked about his return to Japan, he said that he would follow the government's orders in everything and had no preconceived notions of his own. He will be resting at his residence in Shanghai for the time being. It is reported that Ambassador Jiang is scheduled to take the night train to the capital tonight to report on the diplomatic situation with Japan. In addition, Xinsheng News Agency reports that when a reporter questioned Mr. Jiang about the situation in Japan, Mr. Jiang stated that while some Chinese believe that Japan's economy is heading towards collapse, this is greatly mistaken. Economic panic is a common global phenomenon, not unique to Japan. The depreciation of the Japanese exchange rate is actually beneficial to exports because it allows exporting countries to reduce the prices of goods sold abroad. In recent years, Japanese goods have been selling very well in the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, which is evidence of this. While the suspension of foreign exchange by the United States has had some impact on Japan, it is not as severe as the impact on the countries in the Americas. The Chinese people should rise up on their own and not vainly hope that others will be in danger, while neglecting their own efforts.</p>

<p>This month on the 12th is the eighth anniversary of the death of Kuomintang leader Sun Yat-sen. The central government has stipulated that a tree planting ceremony be held on this day and that the afforestation movement be promoted. The municipal government, in accordance with the central government's regulations, will hold a tree planting ceremony at the Dongjiao Municipal Forest Farm at 10:00 AM on the morning of this day, planting 10,000 saplings. At the same time, 10,000 copies of afforestation slogans will be printed and, starting yesterday, workers have been ordered to post them throughout the city, such as "Afforestation Prevents Floods and Droughts" and "Commemorate the Premier and Complete the Afforestation Plan." The Social Affairs Bureau specially transported 3,000 pine and cypress saplings from the nursery yesterday, filling the courtyard of the bureau, in preparation for the schools to come and collect them to participate in the planting at that time. The order of the tree planting ceremony has been drafted and includes: (1) playing music, (2) all standing at attention, (3) singing the Party song, (4) saluting the Party flag and the Premier's portrait, (5) the chairman reading the Premier's will, (6) a moment of silence, (7) singing the tree planting song, (8) the chairman giving the opening remarks, (9) speeches, (10) tree planting, (11) a photograph, and (12) playing music and adjourning.</p>

The groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled for March 12th, and the unveiling ceremony for the bronze statue will be held on November 12th.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Elder Ma Xiangbo, 94, Issues Important Statement on the Current Situation <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Proposes Convening a Temporary National Assembly</p>
<p>To Decide on Overall Policy Toward Japan</p>
<p>Recently, Rehe has fallen and Tianjin and Beijing are in danger. The words and telegrams from all sides emphasize severely punishing Zhang and Tang alone. Elder Ma Xiangbo, 94, has a high-minded and far-sighted vision, and his views are different from others. According to what he said to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency yesterday, "I once jointly issued a declaration with Mr. Zhang Taiyan, denouncing the Japanese invasion of Rehe. Now, this territory of 600,000 square li has actually been occupied by the Japanese. When I heard the news, I felt like I heard thunder in the spring, and I wanted to cry but had no tears, and I have been depressed ever since. Now that I am being interviewed, I would like to express my thoughts. The Huanggutun Incident was indeed a brutal act by the Japanese. Zhang Xueliang did not avenge his father's death, so what does he have left for loving his country and preserving his race? Avenge a private grievance is not what religious people wish to bring up, but Zhang Xueliang's father was the commander of North China at the time, and his position was inherited by Zhang Xueliang himself. The local officials of the country cannot be arbitrarily assassinated by the enemy. Therefore, Zhang Xueliang's revenge for his father should be the action of human morality and national law. Now, he is still sitting on a large army, living safely day and night, just as someone wrote in a limerick, "Hearing that the Japanese attacked Ma Zhanshan, the Japanese army did not enter Shanhaiguan. There is still a pass inside Shanhaiguan, and the pass is not as happy as inside the boudoir. There is a look of "I am happy here and do not think about Shu." Therefore, Zhang Xueliang cannot settle the case of this monstrous disaster without dismissal, punishment, or resignation.</p>
<p>He should stimulate his conscience, swear to avenge his father, and recover the Northeast, and then he can hope to redeem his past sins and still be worthy of a good man with blood. Otherwise, it will be difficult to escape the judgment of heaven and national law. As for Tang Yulin, he is currently the so-called true colors of the warlords, internally imposing heavy taxes and forcing opium cultivation, and externally fleeing upon hearing the wind, retreating without a fight. There are many like this. However, it is better than the puppets of the old Northeast warlords who refuse to surrender to the Japanese. Moreover, the current problem is definitely not the personal responsibility of Tang and Zhang, but rather our</p>
<p>The problem of national defense and saving the country. I still remember that Ming worthy Shi Kefa said, "In the turmoil of the northern capital, all subjects are guilty. Those in the north should die, but are those in the south not subjects? The generals are able to defeat the enemy because of their courage. The rulers are able to control their generals because of their will. If the will of the court is not courageous, then the courage of the army will not be encouraged. There are not many officials in the south who died for their country, and there are few officials in the north who attacked. This is a disgrace for all ages. " The old man's citation of Shi Gong's words is not intentionally excessive, but to awaken the sense of responsibility of the whole people. In fact, the current crisis is surrounded on all sides. Tianjin and Beijing are difficult to defend. Therefore, the so-called ancient objects are ordered to be transported south, and the National University of Peking is also discussing moving to a better place. Since North China is not consolidated, enemy ships are densely deployed along the coastal ports of the Yangtze River, and the capital is in danger again. Moreover, the Japanese so-called lifeline on the water extends to Southeast Asia, and their navy can invade various ports in South China at any time. Therefore, in such a situation, our people can only support the country and resist the enemy as a whole. We must use the strength of the whole country to commit crimes against us, and we</p>
<p>Only partial resistance will not work. It is a pity that the current national policy is extremely confusing. Not only is the foreign enemy invading on a large scale, as if the thief has already entered the house, but the brothers in the family do not love each other, such as the internal turmoil in Sichuan and Guizhou. We must wait for the thief to use a knife on everyone's body before we will be willing to defend ourselves. Of course, it is too late. The Battle of Shanghai and the recent events in Rehe were all initiated by the enemy, and we counterattacked. And we must wait for the enemy to complete their defenses before we start to fight in different places, and we flee without a fight.</p>
<p>It is really outrageous. At the same time, the violent enemy freely dispatches naval, land, and air forces, hoping for more after gaining something, gaining an inch and wanting a foot, and now they declare that they will take Chahar. I don't know if General Feng Yuxiang, who is currently singing anti-Japanese sentiments in that area, is also actively uniting his people to prepare to resist the enemy. Moreover, our country recently recalled its ambassador to Japan, while Japanese diplomats are very active in our country, exhausting all important Chinese and foreign figures to lobby, implementing a "sweet-mouthed and vicious-hearted" diplomatic policy. They also set up intelligence bureaus in major cities, openly acting as national military spies. As for our citizens who enter Japan, they are often illegally detained or monitored. There are news reports every day. Under such a distorted phenomenon, it is no wonder that our representatives to the League of Nations have jointly resigned. Since the September 18th Incident, our country</p>
<p>What exactly is the overall policy towards Japan? The country is in such danger that the government urgently needs the support of the people. I propose that a national assembly be convened immediately, and the government and the people will jointly plan the national policy. The necessary reasons for the national assembly and the way to adopt it will be briefly stated. I remember the Franco-Prussian War. France was invaded, and in a very critical period, a "daddy" came out and proposed convening a national assembly, which laid the foundation for the dangerous situation at that time. Our country's national crisis is now the same, so we should convene representatives of the whole people. The attending representatives should be publicly elected by the people's autonomous groups in each county. The purpose of holding this kind of national assembly is to address important national issues.</p>
<p>Submit it to a national referendum. (1) The issue of war or peace with Japan. In today's situation, we are neither at war nor at peace, and the violent enemy is implementing a policy of gradual encroachment. Today they take a city, and tomorrow they clear a village, so that the officials who do not fight flee upon hearing the wind, and the people's volunteer army loses its base. At the same time, we neither declare a break in relations nor declare that we will not sign a peace treaty, missing the opportunity and losing the country. Therefore, the general will of the people must be given the opportunity to a public vote. As in the previous National Crisis Conference, it was only a so-called advisory body, and the important decisions it made, such as unanimous resistance to insults, were all filed for future reference. Only the resolutions of this kind of national assembly must be implemented by our national government, so that the future of the country will be determined in one fell swoop. (2) The issue of overall national defense. The national military and political affairs must be unified for the sake of national defense. Those who are only loyal to the country and the national government, even a dictatorship is acceptable. We must use the will of the whole people to break the current situation of division and segregation. All military leaders lead their troops back to the country, so that the national army can be used for national defense. As for those who privately raise troops and engage in internal turmoil, the people will publicly judge them, and the crime is unforgivable. (3) The issue of overall financial planning. Because of foreign defense, large expenses are required. The people will publicly decide whether to borrow foreign debt or issue public debt, so that the soldiers defending against insults will have a constant supply of funds and do not need to raise funds in a scattered manner. Because a drop in the bucket is difficult to help. Other internal affairs to be resolved should be decided by the public will of the people. In short, the way to save the country in the future is only the method of "national defense against insults." The revival of the Republic of China depends on this move.</p>

<p>(Opening Speech)</p>
<p>Chairman Wu's representative, Councilor Yin Rugeng, delivered the opening speech, which stated that, "Respected captains, today is the opening ceremony of the second membership recruitment meeting of the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting Domestic Goods. The mayor is unable to attend due to official business and has commissioned me to attend and deliver a speech on his behalf. Our country has been subjected to foreign goods invasion, economic backwardness, and one of the major reasons for the decline of the national situation today. Promoting domestic goods, revitalizing industry, improving craftsmanship, and promoting trade are important tasks for saving the country. Since its establishment, this association has served the domestic goods industry and has achieved great results. Now, at a time of severe national crisis, the association has expanded its organization and intensified its efforts to promote domestic goods to save the country. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Today, the most important work for fundamentally saving the country and maintaining the foundation of the country is to promote domestic goods. It is hoped that the captains present, especially the citizens of the city, will stand on the same front line, join this association, and work together to promote domestic goods, to conduct a long-term resistance, and to carry out a total mobilization to save the country. It is not only the good fortune of this association, but also the good fortune of the country."</p>
<p>(Report)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Rice Merchants' Strike Case Discussed by the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The discussion did not result in a good solution. A second instrument inspection will be held today.</p>
<p>The rice merchants in southern Shanghai have been on strike in protest against the heavy official measure, and this has been going on for two weeks. The rice industry of the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, because the merchants have blocked rice boats and affected people's food, have submitted to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau to find a way to solve the problem as soon as possible. The Social Affairs Bureau specially convened various groups yesterday to discuss the method, and decided to re-measure the instruments today to determine the method. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Party and government organs have determined a method of consultation, and have not yet resolved the problem of dispute of measuring instruments, affecting the people's food. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened various rice industry groups to discuss methods. Those who attended included Jiang Huaisu and He Yuanming from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wu Huanru, Zhang Binghui, and Zhou Minggang from the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhou Zanming from the Bureau of Weights and Measures, Lu Wenshao from the Rice Industry Trade Association, Gu Xinyi from the Bean and Rice Industry Trade Association, Zhang Songtao from the Grains and Rice Trade Association, Cai Yukun from the Miscellaneous Grain and Cake Industry Association, Zhu Zixiang from the Rice Milling Industry Trade Association, Jiang Shizhi from the Shanghai North Transport Rice Merchants Union, Chen Zhiqiang from the Shanghai South Transport Rice Merchants Union, Lu Gongquan, Jin Weixiang, and Lu Junwen from the various Rice Firms, and Lu Quanlin and Cai Mingwang from the Instrument Measurement Union. More than 20 people were present. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Binghui. As a result of the discussion, the two sides had different opinions and could not be decided.</p>
<p>The various masters involved in the second meter inspection and Party and government organs failed to reach an agreement. The Liangyi Association required the implementation of the level measure and funnel, and the Rice Company number requested the abolition of the volume and the change of weight. Party and government representatives believed that the use of funnels was too time-consuming, and the abolition of volume and the change of weight did not have such a system in the mainland, so it was difficult to implement. It was decided that a second inspection of the measuring instrument will be carried out at the Rengutang on Zhonghua Road at 1:00 PM this afternoon, with a considerable amount of liters as the standard. If there is expansion and contraction, it will be calculated by light and heavy measures.</p>

<p>Zhang Haitan Begs for Help</p>
<p>The Northeast Righteous Army Support Association sent a telegram to the newly appointed 117th Division Commander Weng Zhaoyuan yesterday, encouraging him to work hard to kill the enemy. At the same time, they also received a request for assistance from Zhang Haili, commander of the Righteous Army, asking for ways to provide adequate relief. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to encourage Weng Zhaoyuan, Commander Weng, with admiration. I have learned that you have been appointed as the Commander of the 117th Division. The good news has spread, and everyone is excited. The natural barrier of Rehe could have been defended. However, Tang Yulin retreated without a fight, causing the loss of our territory and leading to deeper troubles and a more pressing crisis. The only way to survive now is to be determined to sacrifice and fight back to the death. Since you have the ambition of Fu Bo and Ding Yuan, you will surely be able to raise your prestige. This association will use its red blood and sincerity as your backing and send a special telegram to encourage you. We look forward to hearing good news. Sincerely, Chu Fucheng, Feng Shaoshan, Wu Shan, Yan Zhifang, and Chen Yafu of the Northeast Righteous Army Support Association.</p>
<p>Zhang Haitan Asks for Help</p>
<p>To all the gentlemen of the Support Association: Haitan, with his meager talent, has been entrusted by the people of southern Liaoning to advocate justice and attack Japan. Thanks to the soldiers' knowledge of justice and the people's protection, he has been supporting himself for more than a year. The depth of the soldiers' suffering is difficult to express in words. Last year, when the ammunition was exhausted and the assistance was cut off, it was difficult to support him again. Director Yang Wenlong was sent to Guan for help. General Zhu allocated 6,000 yuan before and after, and your association allocated 5,000 yuan and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. How grateful are Haitan and his subordinates. This time, breaking out from southern Liaoning, he first arrived at Fuxin in Rehe, and recently advanced to There is really no way to express the difficult situation of the soldiers. I would like to ask you to show great compassion and provide adequate assistance, so that the patriots can be encouraged. Then Haitan and others will be grateful. The details of this department are entrusted to Representative Yang Zhaotang for details. Haitan dares not leave for a moment because of the importance of the military brigade. Once the Yellow Dragon has drunk to his heart's content, he will pay homage to the gentlemen and express his gratitude in person, and ask for advice on saving the country to make up for Haitan's ignorance. This is the utmost hope. Sincerely, Zhang Haitan, Commander of the Third Route Army in southern Liaoning, respects.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Fourth Army Deputy Commander Cheng Dejun of Ma Bu Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Says His Unit Still Has 16,000 Men</p>
<p>Urgently Hopes Fellow Countrymen Will Continue to Help Resist the Enemy</p>
<p>General Cheng Dejun, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Army under General Ma Zhanshan, participated in the Jiangqiao Anti-Japanese War. He fought hard for over a year and made significant contributions. This time, due to running out of ammunition and food, he led his troops to retreat to the Xiaoxing'anling area in eastern Heilongjiang. Cheng went to the interior to seek assistance. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Pingnan. A reporter from the Riri News Agency interviewed him at his residence. The details of the interview are recorded below. After Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu's unsuccessful battles, General Ma's troops were forced to retreat due to heavy enemy pressure. General Ma retreated to Russian territory. I led the army in early September of last year, passing through the Nenjiang Nehe from Laha Station to Dedor, intending to reorganize and replenish the troops. At that time, the armies of Deng Wen and Li Haiqing also successively moved to the Rehe border. After we arrived in western Dedor, we came into contact with the puppet state Gao group. Our army resisted strongly, and the 12th Brigade Commander Li Zuolin was martyred, but the group was ultimately disarmed by us, suffering heavy losses. The enemy, knowing our army's fierceness, had the Japanese Gao Po Brigade commander coerce two brigades of the puppet army to surrender in Gannan. At that time, Jia Bochen and Cheng Zhiyuan had already surrendered and sent letters urging us. Since I could not guarantee the integrity of the army, and retreat was difficult, I convened a meeting of officers above the brigade commander level to resolve the situation. They all advocated ["Better to be a Ningzuo rebel than a slave of a fallen nation."] Without surrendering to the puppet state, after being presided over by the Japanese Gao Po Commander and negotiating with me for four weeks without resolution, the army's food supply was running out and there was no way to replenish it. Fortunately, Xu Jingde, the acting Deputy Commander stationed in Jiang, allocated food, and we retreated to the Xiaoxing'anling area in eastern Heilongjiang, conscripting food from the people as temporary relief. About 1,800 soldiers returned to their hometowns, but they all left their weapons behind, now buried in the soil. The remaining troops still number over 16,000, occupying dangerous mountain areas, determined not to surrender to the enemy. However, both bullets and food are lacking. The weather in the northern border region is extremely cold, and we are still wearing single-layered clothing. As the commander, I am truly filled with grief and indignation. Moreover, since our army commander Xu Haiting has already gone to Shanghai, and Chairman Ma Xiufang will also return from Russia, I specifically went to the interior to request assistance from fellow countrymen across the nation, so that we can continue to resist the enemy. Commanders Pu Bingshan and Cai Hongyou, as well as the three army commanders Nan Tingfang and Zhang Xiwu, have 60,000 men hiding in various locations. If they can receive active assistance, they can rise up again immediately and fight against the enemy. As for the puppet state of Manchuria's Zhang Haipeng, Cheng Guorui, and Zi Zhishan, they can also be persuaded to understand the greater righteousness and revolt against the Japanese. Moreover, with the arrival of spring, the soil in Heilongjiang is thawing, and the muddy and rugged terrain renders enemy tanks ineffective, allowing our side to seize the opportunity to launch a major offensive and recover lost territory. Since the September 18th Incident, I have long disregarded life and death, only seeking that the soldiers have bullets and food. I will then return to Heilongjiang to lead troops to kill the enemy, restraining the Japanese army's rear. If the Japanese advance into North China and the Jiangnan region, it cannot be averted without a unified national resistance.</p>

<h3 id="e88">China National Products Introduction Center Officially Established Today Branch Offices to Be Established in Various Locations <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association, organized by Shanghai's national product manufacturers, has been preparing to establish a China National Products Introduction Center in Shanghai since its establishment, and plans to set up branch offices in various locations in order to awaken the nation's unified adoption of national products. It is reported that the China National Products Introduction Center has been fully prepared, and the address has been selected at No. 1 Yuemingyuan Road. Xie Yunting has been appointed as the manager, and Shi Qichen and Lu Qianting as the deputy managers. The official establishment will be held today. Here is the opening declaration of the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association, Shanghai General Office of the China National Products Introduction Center. At this time of global economic panic, people from all countries are doing their utmost to increase and expand production and stabilize and balance consumption. How can our backward country, trapped in dire straits, not rise up and quickly seek countermeasures, recognize the direction, and determine the most effective and practical method to save the country? What is the method? It is to promote national products. Promoting national products is the fundamental work to solve the people's livelihood problem, the only way to strive for material construction, the supreme weapon to prevent international oppression and establish national defense, and the goal that people across the country should strive for together. However, promoting national products has been talked about repeatedly. Instead of empty talk, it is better to ask for implementation. In seeking implementation, the most effective and powerful work should be adopted first. Today, compatriots across the country all have the hope of using national products. With this keen need, there must be a sufficient supply. Therefore, thorough research must be conducted on the quantity, quality, and price of national products, so that the items supplied by the producers can meet the standards needed by the people of the country, and consumers can have the convenience of identifying and purchasing national products. Only then can supply and demand be met, and goods be fully utilized and smoothly circulated. With China's vast territory and abundant production, if we want to correct the mistakes of the past and determine the direction of the future, it will not be possible without the joint efforts of producers and sellers to implement thorough cooperation. In order to complete this mission of cooperation, it is even more necessary to have a sound organizational structure and unified national assistance. Adhering to this purpose, this association has gathered national product manufacturers in Shanghai to organize the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association, which has been registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and has received strong support from the government. On the one hand, it is responsible for promoting the products of national product factories and improving publicity. On the other hand, it is responsible for introducing the production and industrial raw materials of various places to domestic and foreign markets. In order to further promote its effectiveness and usefulness in the interior, national product introduction branch offices are set up in various places to introduce goods from various places to domestic and foreign markets, report consumption situations, display national product samples, and accept wholesale orders, so that the people of the country can recognize the advantages of national products and distinguish the standards for selection and purchase, so that producers have no worries about not being able to sell and consumers are spared the trouble of selecting and seeking. The National Product Introduction Center is established at No. 1 Yuemingyuan Road, Shanghai, to serve as the hub for promoting national products to the interior, receiving orders, and investigating consumption. This association will also engage in research on improving [quality], increasing [quantity], balancing [prices], and [market] conditions, with the aim of establishing a close relationship between producers and sellers and achieving the effect of division of labor and cooperation. As the General Office is now completed and officially opened, this association has something to tell the people of society. The organization of the National Product Introduction Center is an organic body with a cellular function. In the future, it should do its best to promote and exercise its functions and strive to be the vanguard of society. However, supply arises from needs, and sales are valued for their universality. How to purchase and use as much as possible, and how to provide as much assistance and guidance as possible, depends on the people of the country to provide a strong backing in order to achieve success. It is also hoped that entrepreneurs will take it as their duty to research products and reduce costs, laborers will take it as their responsibility to refine technology and increase production, women will take purchasing national products as a prerequisite for consumption, and children will take using national products as a great honor. In this way, with the same steps and the same goal, each fulfilling their national responsibility and working hard in their respective positions, the total mobilization of the national product movement will be realized. The smooth sales of national products can be expected soon, and the opportunity for this association to serve will also be increased. The revitalization of China's economy will be realized, which is not only the honor of this association. However, at the beginning of the creation, there are many shortcomings. We hope that people from all walks of life will not hesitate to give us instructions. Furthermore, the China National Products Introduction Center</p>
<p>Opening Speech</p>
<p>In the year of national products and under the serious circumstances of national crisis, this office is officially opened. The importance of its mission and the arduousness of its responsibility can be imagined. The establishment of this office is based on the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association, which brings together pure national product manufacturers in Shanghai to form a whole organization. On the one hand, it is responsible for promoting the products of national product factories and improving publicity. On the other hand, it is responsible for introducing the production and industrial raw materials of various places to domestic and foreign markets. In order to further promote its effectiveness and usefulness in various places, national product introduction branch offices are set up in major trading ports to introduce goods from various places to domestic and foreign markets, report consumption situations, display national product samples, and accept wholesale orders, so that the people of the country can recognize the advantages of national products and distinguish the standards for selection and purchase, so that producers have no worries about not being able to sell and consumers are spared the trouble of selecting and seeking. This office oversees its completion, with the aim of establishing a close relationship between producers and sellers and achieving the effect of division of labor and cooperation. On the occasion of this opening, we would like to ask for guidance and hope that people from all walks of life will catch up and cooperate to take the same steps and move towards the same goal, vigorously practicing Sun Yat-sen's "make the best use of everything and ensure smooth flow of goods" principle. Entrepreneurs should take it as their duty to research products and reduce costs, laborers should take it as their responsibility to refine technology and increase production, women should take purchasing national products as a prerequisite for consumption, and children should take using national products as a great glory. Although this office's ability is limited, its aspirations are great. In the future, it should follow the lead of all sectors of society, do its best to promote and utilize its functions, and strive to be the medium of production and sales and the vanguard of society in order to complete the mission of production and sales cooperation and attempt to revive the social economy. We, the enthusiastic and patriotic people of this country, will go forward and teach it.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Annual Work of the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Thomas, the Commander of the International Chamber of Commerce in the Public Concession, has prepared a report on the activities of the Chamber of Commerce in 1932 and submitted it to the Public Works Department. The summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Annual Inspection</p>
<p>The annual inspection of the Chamber of Commerce last year was conducted by Major General Fleming, the British Commander in Shanghai. His inspection report has been published in the Public Works Department Gazette in July.</p>
<p>Mobilization Work</p>
<p>On January 28th of last year, the Chamber of Commerce mobilized the Russian Volunteer Corps to guard the defense line with four hours' notice. Within six hours, all corps were mobilized and concentrated. At that time, there were many personnel shortages, and the infantry had only 50% of its personnel. Within ten days of mobilization, recruitment was continuously increased, and the total number increased from 1,500 to 2,300. However, most of the newly recruited members lacked training, and military uniforms and boots were also incomplete, which was extremely difficult. However, the general spirit was very good. Several corps members who lived in the vicinity of Distsheng suffered robbery of all their belongings at home because they were eager to go to the call. This is especially memorable.</p>
<p>Personnel Replenishment</p>
<p>Due to the experience of mobilization, personnel have been replenished. However, the infantry still has a shortage of 27%, which is about 400 people. New teams have been organized to increase the number of people. Efforts have been made to list former military personnel and other experienced personnel as reserve members of each team, and they will be called up with their respective teams when necessary.</p>
<p>Clothing and Provisions</p>
<p>Military boots are essential. Many of those who were called up last year only wore cloth shoes, which were not suitable. If military boots were provided completely free of charge, it would not only be very expensive, but the team members would often leave after a few months. Therefore, the current method is to prepare a certain number of military boots, which team members can purchase at cost price. In the future, new team members will be required to prepare their own boots. In addition, the overcoats used by the team members cannot protect against rain. Waterproof jackets have now been prepared for distribution during the call-up. As for the food for the team members when they depart, it has been customary to issue money for them to purchase themselves. This is inconvenient during active operations. Now the headquarters has prepared a method of providing food itself, so that the team members serving in the first place can be transferred at will without having to worry about food.</p>
<p>Transportation and Engineering</p>
<p>During the mobilization of the Chamber of Commerce, transportation was handled by the Public Works Department, which was very satisfactory. However, in view of the need for transporting supplies, a transportation team has been formed for command. Most of the officers in the team are employees of the Public Works Department. As for the engineering team, it was being reorganized at the time of mobilization. Currently, the team is entirely composed of Public Works Department personnel. During the deployment, the Public Works Department personnel worked extremely hard, adding barbed wire and creating several miles in a very short time.</p>
<p>Names of Each Team</p>
<p>In addition to the General Headquarters, the Chamber of Commerce has the following organizations: Shanghai Light Cavalry, Volunteer Corps, Shanghai Land Artillery, Shanghai Light Artillery, Engineering Team, Armored Vehicle Team, A Team, B Team, American Volunteer Team, Portuguese Team, Japanese Volunteer Team, Chinese Team, Scottish Volunteer Team, H Team, Philippine Team, American Volunteer Machine Gun Team, American Volunteer Reserve Team, Transportation Team, Internal Transportation Team, Interpreter Team, Air Defense Team, Russian Volunteer Team (composed of four squads, the first, second, and fourth squads are regular corps members, and the third squad are volunteer corps members), and Public School Trainee Team. In addition, there are military musicians, drivers, medical staff, chaplains, reserve officers, and reserve corps members, totaling 191 officers and 1,943 corps members.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the General Management Office of Various Industries Insurance in Shanghai, many parties have come to entrust insurance, because the regulations set by the company are convenient and the handling procedures are more agile than usual. Therefore, leaders from various industries in Shanghai and other locations have successively requested to establish branch management offices to promote the business. After careful consideration, the office has appointed qualified candidates as directors of the branch management offices, such as Mr. Shao of the First Branch Management Office, Mr. of the Second Branch Management Office, Mr. Ningbo Hu Guorong of the Third Branch Management Office, Mr. Mingbo of the Fourth Branch Management Office, and Mr. Sheng Lin Cai of the Fifth Branch Management Office. Others are still under negotiation.</p>

<h3 id="e91">French Concession Police Uncover a Large Gang of Taihu Bandits <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Rescuing a Kidnapped Farmer from Dangshan Bay, Jiaxing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the French Concession police uncovered a large gang of Taihu bandits who had come to Shanghai from Jiaxing. They rescued a kidnapped victim from Jiaxing on the spot, and arrested a total of eleven male and female bandits. The details are described below.</p>
<p>(Farmer's Life)</p>
<p>In Dangshan Bay, outside the South Gate of Jiaxing, there lived a farmer named Chen Tianyou, aged 48, who was relatively well-off. He had a wife, Nee, and only one son and one daughter. His eldest daughter was already engaged, and his son, named Zurong (nicknamed Amao), was 14 years old. He was intelligent by nature and had a dignified appearance, unlike most farm children. Therefore, the elderly couple loved him like the apple of their eye. At the age of seven, he began studying at a local private school. The family lived in harmony, enjoying their rural life. Unexpectedly, disaster struck from within.</p>
<p>(Taihu Bandits)</p>
<p>Because Chen's family was relatively well-off, they had long been noticed by bandits. It happened that in the middle of the first lunar month of this year, at dusk, more than ten Taihu bandits suddenly arrived. They first looted all of Chen's property and then kidnapped Chen's beloved son, Zurong. Afterwards, the bandits transferred the hostage to Shanghai by waterway and hid him in a bandit den at No. 3 Ping'anfang, Lane 155, Xuehuali Road, in the French Concession.</p>
<p>(Negotiations in Shanghai)</p>
<p>After losing his beloved son, Chen was distraught. Before long, he received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 4,000 yuan. After repeated negotiations, because the amounts were too far apart, it was impossible to reach an agreement. Recently, they sent another letter inviting Chen to Shanghai, stating that they would meet him at the entrance of Baoyuli, Caishi Street, in the French Concession at around 8:00 am yesterday. After receiving the letter, Chen immediately sent someone to Shanghai to negotiate everything.</p>
<p>(Bandits' Extravagant Desires)</p>
<p>After Chen's representative arrived in Shanghai, he knew that the bandits' desires were too extravagant and feared that there would be no satisfactory outcome. Therefore, he resolutely entrusted someone to secretly report to Jin Jiulin, Inspector of the French Concession Police. At around 8:00 am yesterday, Inspector Jin notified Detective Henry of the Western Branch, who immediately led detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Yaoting, Zhou Bingcheng, Qin Youyu, detective Cai Jinzhang, Ma Yizhi, Zhang Chunsheng, and Xu Guilin, disguised themselves and secretly carried weapons, and first ambushed themselves at the entrance of Baoyuli.</p>
<p>(Lowest Ransom Price)</p>
<p>First, Chen's representative, according to the bandits' letter, made a mark and stood waiting at the entrance of Baoyuli. At around 8:00 am, he saw a person greet him and then led him to Room 4 of the Huhai Inn in the lane to talk secretly. At this time, the detectives rushed in and arrested two bandits on the spot. They also found a ransom letter addressed to Chen in the crotch of the bandit leader Shen Yuyun's pants. The envelope was marked "To be handed over in person [Received by Mr. Chen Tianyou]." The sender was named [Shen Chuanjun]. The content stated that 3,500 yuan was the lowest ransom price.</p>

<h3 id="e92">News of the Long-Missing Yurong Ship Sinking <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Searched for Without Success by Customs Offices Everywhere</p>
<p>Rumored to Have Sunk Near Qiongzhou</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Yurong, a ship represented by the Tongyu Shipping Company, set sail from Hongji on December 8th of last year, loaded with coal, heading for Shanghai. It suddenly disappeared. The company offered a reward for its search, but there was no trace. According to reliable sources, the ship encountered a hurricane and sank near Hainan Island. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Searched Everywhere Without Success)</p>
<p>After the Yurong ship disappeared, customs offices everywhere used radio to search for it without success. The crew members' families were extremely frightened and requested assistance from the company. Although the company offered a large reward, there was still no news. The company sent three people, including the brother of the ship's first mate, to Hong Kong to search along the way. The company received a telegram from Hong Kong yesterday reporting that they were also unable to find it. According to company personnel, the Yurong ship must have had an accident and sunk. If it had been stolen, there would not have been no news until now. The shipping industry generally believes that it encountered a hurricane and sank.</p>
<p>(Encountered a Hurricane and Sank)</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from a seaman from Hongji who was familiar with navigation (i.e., the pilot who took the ship out) that the Yurong ship sank near Hainan Island after leaving port. As for the reason for the sinking, the Yurong ship was overloaded with coal, and the waterline was more than one foot over. It was very dangerous when leaving the port. Encountering a hurricane near Hainan Island, an overloaded ship could not resist the strong winds and waves, so it sank in an instant. The crew members were unable to escape. It is learned that the ship's load capacity was only 2,700 tons, but this time it was loaded with 2,400 tons of coal.</p>

<p>Xu Peikun, President of the National Shanghai College of Commerce, is a veteran of economic studies. When the reporter asked him about the American financial crisis yesterday, Xu shared the following views: The American financial crisis has been going on for more than four years. The reason why we are paying attention to it today is because the recent turmoil seems to be more serious. It is like a fire in a house that has broken through the roof. The thick smoke and flames are frightening. Today, we learned that American banks have gradually resumed business, and the Shanghai Gold Standard Market is still active, soaring by more than ten taels, as if the American financial crisis has been resolved and the fire in the house has been extinguished.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Mr. Zhu Sues Daughter-in-Law and In-Laws for Abandonment After the Untimely Death of His Beloved Son <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Not living together in life, not attending his side in illness, not relying on his coffin in death.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Sui laments the premature death of his son, expressing his feelings in words, unable to bear it in his heart.</p>
<p>The daughter-in-law, supporting herself despite illness, arrived in court, tears streaming down her face; her situation is also pitiful.</p>
<p>| The judge, with good intentions, hopes that both parties will reconcile |</p>
<p>Zhu Junsui, from Yin County, Zhejiang, is currently sixty-three years old. He lives at No. 63, Sen Yi Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, Meibai Ge Road, and works at the Nanyang Advertising Company on Fuzhou Road. Recently, he hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against his daughter-in-law, Wu Huilian (age 26, from Suzhou), and her parents, Wu Xunqing and his daughter, for abandonment.</p>
<p>The complaint roughly states that his son was abandoned by his daughter-in-law while ill, leading to his death. He requests severe punishment according to the law. It reads: "I, the plaintiff, am nearing seventy years old and approaching the end of my life. The world is bustling and chaotic, and I have tasted all the bitterness of life. The only comfort in my old age is my children. My second son, Zhongkan, was intelligent from a young age. When he grew up, I arranged a marriage for him to fulfill my long-cherished wish. On October 18th of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, he married Wu Huilian. I thought that as a young couple, their love would be steadfast, sharing clothes and food, bringing comfort in my twilight years. Unexpectedly, Huilian was naturally strong and independent and did not maintain proper behavior, leaving our home to build her own nest. Out of deep love for my son, I did not dare to completely disregard her wishes, only hoping that she would have a good home and that they would maintain a harmonious relationship. This single thought was enough to comfort me. Unexpectedly, in the late spring of last year, Zhongkan fell ill. After treatment by both Chinese and Western doctors, his condition seemed manageable. However, because his wife was restless and her whereabouts were vague, and not long after their marriage, she repeatedly used excuses to return to her parents' home. In August, she left and never returned. There was no one to prepare medicine or tea, no one to care for him, and his illness worsened, increasing his loneliness. Like grass in late autumn, how could he withstand the frost? Like a flower subjected to torment, how could he endure the heavy rain? As a result, his illness lingered, and even doctors were helpless. His youthful vigor was completely depleted. Seeing him tossing and turning in bed, moaning on his pillow, calling out with no one to answer, leaving his feelings to whom? The pitiful state was unbearable to witness. I am old and frail, unable to care for myself, let alone provide for him. Zhongkan was alone and could not bear to be alone. Although I tried many ways to persuade her to return, hoping that someone would care for him and his illness would improve, she repeatedly refused with various excuses, claiming to be ill. Zhongkan was heartbroken upon hearing this, losing all interest in life, and his illness worsened, becoming incurable. No one could be found to take on the responsibility of caring for him. Like Bo Dao, who had no descendants, there was no one to bring joy to his face. Material support was nonexistent, and spiritual pain was profound. Who is without feelings, who can endure this? His illness was incurable for this reason. Thus, less than a year after the marriage, Zhongkan passed away on November 25th of last year. Alas, how painful! Counting the days since Huilian returned to her parents' home until Zhongkan's death, there were over a hundred days. During this period, Huilian neither appeared nor inquired about him. Her intentions are incomprehensible. As his legal wife, she abruptly abandoned her sick husband. Her cruel behavior is despised by humanity. Therefore, although Huilian did not kill Zhongkan directly, Zhongkan died because of Huilian. I still remember my deceased son's final moments, tears welling up in his eyes, calling out his wife's name, as if wanting to see her one last time to express his heart full of sorrow. The scene was so desolate that everyone present shed tears and felt heartbroken. Yet, the defendant remained indifferent, so heartless that it was beyond normal. Now, two months have passed since Zhongkan's death. Despite repeated notifications of his death and invitations for the seventh-day ceremony, she has disappeared without a trace. I am an old man in my twilight years, suffering such misfortune, grieving over the premature death of my beloved son, and filled with unbearable anger. As husband and wife, they did not live together in life, she did not attend his side in illness, she did not rely on his coffin in death, and she did not weep at his funeral. The facts are clear and cannot be concealed. Her malicious abandonment is undeniable. Zhongkan was originally self-sufficient, but when his illness became incurable, he had no ability to save himself. Wu Huilian, as Zhongkan's wife, was legally obligated to provide support and protection. Now, Huilian not only failed to fulfill this obligation but also suddenly returned to her parents' home when Zhongkan was seriously ill and never returned, leading to Zhongkan's death. Her actions violate Article 310 and the second clause of the Criminal Law. Wu Xunqing instigated his daughter's actions and should be punished equally according to Article 43 of the same law. If justice is served and my grievance is redressed, I will be eternally grateful, whether in life or in death." The court accepted the complaint and issued a warrant to summon the defendants. On October 18th, both parties were summoned for questioning. As the plaintiff did not appear, the court dismissed the complaint. Upon hearing this, Zhu Junsui entrusted his lawyer to submit a justification and appeal for reinstatement. The collegial panel approved the request, and the case was scheduled for a hearing yesterday afternoon. A summons was issued to the defendants, and Chinese constable Guo Xiang was dispatched to notify them. After receiving the summons, Wu Huilian also hired lawyer Zhu Sifu to submit a response.</p>
<p>The defense roughly states, regarding the abandonment case brought by Zhu Junsui, that she is responding according to the law. She states that in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, she was betrothed to the deceased Zhu Zhongkan through parental arrangement. Due to Zhongkan's illness, the marriage was postponed until November 1st of the twentieth year of the Republic of China. At that time, he was still coughing up blood, and his lung disease worsened after the marriage. He received medical treatment for years, with varying degrees of improvement, but never fully recovered. Later, the defendant also became ill, and medical treatment was ineffective. On August 18th of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, she returned to her parents' home, and her illness worsened. On November 17th of the same year, she went to Hangzhou for medical treatment. Her body, weakened by prolonged illness, was further strained by the journey, and she was bedridden. Zhongkan passed away while the defendant was seriously ill. She is still receiving medical treatment, and any significant movement causes dizziness. This is the factual situation of the defendant's condition after marriage and her current state of illness. Now, the plaintiff is suing for abandonment. In a family where father, son, and brothers live together and share property, suing the daughter-in-law for abandonment after the son's death, whether the defendant, as a wife, receives no financial support from the plaintiff for food, clothing, and medicine, constitutes abandonment should be determined first according to law and considering the circumstances. The complaint states that October 18th of the twentieth year of the Republic of China was the date of the defendant's marriage to Zhongkan, which is inconsistent with the facts. The complaint also claims that she was restless and her whereabouts were vague. Considering that the defendant was a wife of a sick husband at the beginning of the marriage, constantly providing medicine and filled with sorrow, how could she be restless and her whereabouts vague in just ten months? These are baseless accusations and arbitrary defamation. The plaintiff has no pity for his daughter-in-law, how can he comfort his deceased son in the afterlife? A lawsuit between the paternal grandfather and daughter-in-law after the son's death is a family tragedy that the defendant cannot bear to speak of. Therefore, she has submitted this statement to express her grief and earnestly requests a judgment according to the law. Wu Xunqing, in addition to hiring lawyer Pei to respond, also filed a countersuit against Zhu Junsui for false accusation. Judge Qian Wen of the Second Criminal Division of the court presided over the hearing.</p>
<p>Both parties, along with their lawyers, appeared in court. The defendant, Wu Huilian, dressed in plain clothes and appearing ill, was supported by a female relative. Her lawyer, Zhu Sifu, stated that Wu Huilian was summoned to court despite her illness and requested permission for her to remain seated during the hearing due to her frailty, which was granted by the court. The plaintiff, Zhu Junsui, stated that he had two sons. The elder son, currently thirty-two years old, works at the Minghua Bank. The younger son, Zhongkan, was twenty-three years old and worked in the gauze exchange with the defendant, Wu Xunqing. Zhongkan was originally very healthy. On October 18th of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, he married Wu Huilian. Within two months, Zhongkan became ill, and Huilian frequently returned to her parents' home. On January 28th of last year, she left and never returned. This was at the time when Zhongkan was seriously ill. When people were sent to call her, she ignored them and went to Hangzhou for leisure. Wu Xunqing, as her father, should have advised her to return to her husband's home. Not only did he fail to advise her, but he also did not visit his son-in-law when he was seriously ill. Therefore, they are jointly accused. The judge stated that according to Zhu Junsui's statement, the only accusation against Wu Xunqing was his failure to visit his sick son-in-law, which is a matter of morality and human relations and cannot be considered a crime. Wu Huilian testified that she married Zhongkan on October 1st of the lunar calendar of the previous year. Within three or four days of the marriage, she saw Zhongkan coughing up blood and asked him about it. He said it was nothing and that he had been coughing up blood for two years. She also had an illness and agreed with her husband to return to her parents' home. At that time, her husband was as usual. Later, her husband also often visited her. Because her illness has lingered until now, she has not returned. Her relationship with her husband was very close in ordinary times. Tears streamed down her face, overwhelmed with sadness. Lawyer Zhu presented medical prescriptions and doctor's diagnoses to the court. The judge persuaded Zhu Junsui, saying that he and the defendants were all relatives, one being his in-laws and the other being his daughter-in-law. Moreover, Zhongkan died of illness and not because the defendants had any malicious intent. As for Wu Xunqing, his failure to visit his sick son-in-law is a matter of human relations and morality and not related to the law. Therefore, it would be better to attempt reconciliation outside of court to avoid a prolonged lawsuit that would harm both sides. If the feelings between them cannot be restored in the future, and if this case is pursued further, the outcome is difficult to predict. Zhu Junsui did not heed this advice. The witnesses Shao Yefu and Chai Zhixian were questioned. The court ordered the commencement of arguments. The lawyers for both parties stood up in turn and argued for a long time. The judge still adhered to the principle of settling matters peacefully and advised Zhu Junsui. He also said that the lawyers for both parties have already argued. According to the rules, a conclusion can be announced, a judgment can be rendered in court, or a judgment can be scheduled for a later date. However, if a judgment is rendered, one party will inevitably lose. To maintain the future relationship between the two parties and avoid a split, a chance will be given. The case will not be concluded today but will be reviewed again in seven days. It is hoped that a reconciliation can be reached and the case can be withdrawn. Otherwise, a judgment will be rendered at that time. Both parties agreed and withdrew. It is unknown what the outcome of this case involving the daughter-in-law and her parents will be.</p>
<p>Looking at the actual content, the American financial turmoil today is like the financial turmoil of four years ago. The current turmoil has not subsided and remains the same. The fire in the room, although extinguished, can easily be rekindled. The causes of the American financial turmoil are extremely complex, but I have spoken of them four years ago and have not changed my position. The events of the past four years have conformed to what I said. When the Kemmerer Commission was in Shanghai, it advocated for China to adopt the gold standard. I repeatedly refuted this in numerous articles. At that time, there were various opinions among the Chinese people, with some supporting and some opposing, and no consensus was reached. In less than a year, countries abandoned the gold standard one after another, and the Chinese people began to believe that what I said was not wrong and had meaning. Several months ago, representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France attending the International Economic Conference declared that these three countries were determined to maintain the gold standard and that they firmly believed that only by restoring the gold standard could the world's commercial decline be remedied. When this statement came out, those in China who advocated for the gold standard cited it as a good thing, believing that China should also follow the example of major countries. At that time, I deeply feared that the Chinese people would change their position again. Fortunately, in recent weeks, the Legislative Yuan has passed and implemented the silver standard law, which is truly a blessing for our country. The gold standard system that I mentioned is the fundamental and primary cause of the current American financial turmoil and the world's commercial decline. If the United States does not abandon the gold standard, the turmoil in the United States will not subside. Furthermore, if countries do not abandon the gold standard, there is no hope for the world's commercial decline to recover. In addition to the gold standard, the Sino-Japanese War, the increase in the number of unemployed people in the world, and the economic activities of Russia are all related causes of the American financial turmoil. The Sino-Japanese War is a particularly significant underlying cause. The trade relations between China and Japan with various countries are extremely important. Now, due to the war, they have withdrawn from the international market, and the industrial and commercial enterprises and laborers of various countries have been greatly affected, which in turn affects the finances of the United States. It is particularly noteworthy that the Sino-Japanese War will likely trigger a second world war and will plunge the world's economic decline into an unrecoverable state. If the Sino-Japanese War is not resolved, the world's economic decline will inevitably become more severe, with no possibility of escaping it. Some economists have stated that excessive speculation and overproduction are the causes of today's economic decline. If "excessive speculation" refers to the speculation caused by the gold-silver price ratio, it may be reasonable. In reality, it exposes the ills of the gold standard. As for "overproduction," it is a ridiculous argument. World production is not excessive. Regarding the impact of the current American financial turmoil on China, both positive and negative, I will list the most noteworthy points as follows: (1) Since China is on the silver standard, when gold becomes cheap, silver will inevitably become expensive. China's wealth will increase significantly, and its purchasing power will also increase significantly. Goods that cannot be produced domestically can be easily exchanged with a small number of silver coins. This is the first benefit for our country. (2) When silver becomes expensive in our country, our wealth will increase, and our international credit will naturally increase. The status of international public debt will naturally increase. This is the second benefit for our country. (3) When silver becomes expensive in our country, international trade is expected to become active, and tax revenue will increase accordingly. This is the third benefit. However, there is also a negative aspect, which is not insignificant. When silver becomes expensive, imports will increase. Our country's industry is still in its early stages, and due to fierce competition, the sales of domestic goods will inevitably be hit. It is necessary to increase import tariffs to counteract this. There are many other related issues, which I will discuss in detail when I have the opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Shouts of Kidnapping on Luban Road <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>But the car sped away</p>
<p>The identity of the hostage is unknown</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:45 PM, passersby on Luban Road, at the entrance of Xingxing Lane in the Second District of Nanshi, suddenly heard shouts of kidnapping. Soon, someone reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station under its jurisdiction, claiming that a black car without license plates had been parked near the entrance of Xingxing Lane. Shortly after, a person riding in a rickshaw passed by. Four or five kidnappers jumped out of the car, dragged the passenger off the rickshaw, and forced them into the car. The passenger shouted for kidnapping. When nearby residents heard the shouts and rushed out, they only saw the car speeding away, so they could not identify the license plate number. The patrol officer immediately reported the incident to the Second District Headquarters. District Chief Jin, upon hearing the news, ordered a senior police officer to rush to the scene for investigation. As of the time of this newspaper's publication, the name of the kidnapped hostage had not been ascertained.</p>

<h3 id="e97">External Instruction Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Various parties are actively engaging in negotiations</p>
<p>The United Association will continue its meeting today</p>
<p>The case of a Vietnamese constable shooting a Chinese person on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession has been ongoing for two weeks. Although various sectors are very indignant, the French authorities have not yet made a concrete statement. The United Association for the Tragedy, organized by various hometown associations and groups, is actively engaging in negotiations. The external instruction arrived in Shanghai yesterday, with details as follows:</p>
<p>External Instruction</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, the Diplomatic Bureau instructed the association yesterday, with document number Zhengzi 10164, regarding the telegram submitted by the Ningbo Association in Shanghai concerning the case of the Vietnamese constable shooting Liu Fugao in the French Concession, requesting negotiations. The telegram was noted. The Shanghai Municipal Government has been instructed to promptly investigate and initiate negotiations. You are hereby informed. Upon receiving this instruction, the association immediately recorded it and distributed it to various groups for reference.</p>
<p>Legal Deliberations</p>
<p>Regarding the legal issues of this case, the lawyers met at the Ningbo Association the day before yesterday to discuss and decide on a plan. It was generally agreed that the public prosecution portion of this case falls under the jurisdiction of the French police. According to lawyer Wu Kaisheng's report, the French police have already appointed a French lawyer as their litigation agent. He can appear in court to assist with everything during the public hearing. Since it is a public trial, anyone concerned can attend and observe. As for the private prosecution portion, there are still studies to be done due to extraterritoriality. After discussion among various legal experts, it was deemed more appropriate to request Du Yuesheng to mediate.</p>
<p>Compensation Issues</p>
<p>Regarding the request for compensation from the families of the victims, the lawyers hired by the relevant Ningbo, Chaozhou, Pudong, and Changzhou hometown associations are conducting a detailed investigation of the circumstances of the victims' families and the amount of funds needed for post-mortem care and support. After the collection is completed, the case will be submitted to the mediator, Du Yuesheng, for consultation with the French authorities. However, the exact amount is currently undetermined. The numbers circulating outside are all inaccurate.</p>
<p>Continuing the Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Aid French Concession Tragedy United Association, to discuss the direction of negotiations, notified the committee members of seventeen groups yesterday that the third committee meeting will be held at 5:00 PM today, still on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Association on Xizang Road, to continue the proceedings based on the resolutions passed at the last general meeting.</p>
<p>Postponing the Petition</p>
<p>Regarding the recommendation of representatives to petition party and government organs, requesting serious negotiations with the French authorities, it was decided to temporarily postpone the negotiations because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the municipal government to negotiate, and the compensation issue has also been entrusted to Du Yuesheng for negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Northeast National Salvation Army Joint Office Telegram to Zhu Jiqing <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast National Salvation Army's various army offices in Shanghai telegraphed Zhu Jiqing yesterday, stating their grievances. The text reads: "To General Director Jiqing, We admire your leadership as you led your troops out of the pass to fight the enemy, braving the hardships of travel for several months. Following your banner, we rose up in response and fought for over a year under the banner of the General Director's righteous army. Due to the exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, we re-entered the pass seeking assistance. However, with the General Director at the front, information was cut off. The responsible personnel in Tianjin and other places harbored prejudices, and opinions were divided. The recruitment of basic troops has been obstructed, and the support from affiliated departments is lacking. The proposed plan is to wait for a comprehensive solution and plan for long-term resistance. It is also said that your good intentions for saving the country and building a strong army have caused representatives to become alienated and dispersed. The staff have been wandering in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong for over a month, crying out for help. Now, with the agreement of the Shanghai office, we are able to telegraph the General Director, requesting detailed instructions on future planning and early allocation of support to allow our righteous army to continue fighting and shedding blood, saving our 30 million people from the trampling of iron hooves, recovering lost territory, and fulfilling the initial intention of saving the country, and comforting the people's enthusiastic expectations of assistance. We eagerly await your orders. The Joint Office in Shanghai of the Independent 17th Detachment, the 8th Branch, the 16th Branch, the 19th Branch, the 1st Separate Detachment, and the 35th Division of the Northeast National Salvation Army respectfully kowtows."</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Zhengtai Factory's Disaster Relief Fund Ends <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Since the boiler explosion at the Zhengtai Enamel Factory on the 21st of last month, resulting in a major disaster, the factory authorities reported the cause of the accident and the situation of the relief to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. All relief funds for the eighty or so victims have been claimed by their families as of yesterday (the 8th). For this relief, the original amount for each deceased victim was 300 yuan. For the sake of providing for the families of the victims, the factory specially issued an additional 50 yuan, increasing the amount to 350 yuan per person. The families expressed their gratitude when claiming the funds. It is rare for the factory to make such efforts in compensating for the disaster it is undergoing. It is said that the relationship between labor and management in the factory is harmonious, so after the disaster, they understood each other and the matter was concluded. Now, they are working hard to ensure that the delivery of goods is smooth and unhindered, implementing the spirit of labor-management cooperation to promote the development of national goods.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Greyhound Association's Lawsuit Continues <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>| Jurors' Opinions Not Entirely the Same |</p>
<p>The Greyhound Association's lawsuit regarding the closure of the Xinfeng Mingyuan Greyhound Track continued its hearing yesterday at the British Assize Court. The part of the lawsuit concerning current Extra Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Martin, was heard. After the plaintiff's lawyer presented his final arguments to the jurors, Judge Grain addressed the jurors, analyzing the circumstances of the case. The jurors then retired to the deliberation room at 11:50 AM to discuss the case. However, the five jurors' opinions were not entirely the same, and a decision had not been reached by 12:30 PM. Judge Grain clearly stated in his instructions that he believed the Shanghai Municipal Council's closure of this large gambling establishment, deemed to be obstructing the public, was within its power. The Council's power is to maintain good governance and good order within the International Settlement. Judge Grain's instructions stated that this case had taken up a lot of time for the jurors and himself. Under normal circumstances, there would not have been a lawsuit. The first issue in this case is whether the Shanghai Municipal Council has the power to close the greyhound track. There has been much dispute over this point, but there is little basis for determining the true power of the Shanghai Municipal Council. This undoubtedly falls under the jurisdiction of the Consular Court. This case is the plaintiff accusing the defendant Martin and the Shanghai Municipal Council of violating civil law, but no evidence has been presented. We must rely on common sense as the basis for our judgment regarding the power of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Grain then discussed the powers of the Shanghai Municipal Council as outlined in the Yangjingbang Regulations and the Council's bylaws, stating that the police have great power in managing traffic and can close roads. What the authorities did was send police to the road to prevent the public from entering Mingyuan, but there is no evidence to constitute the crime of trespassing on private land. He also stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council had notified the plaintiff that the sale of dog racing tickets was illegal and had given them some time to hesitate. At that time, there was some correspondence between the parties. The plaintiff could not stop dog racing due to a contract related to electricity supply, as if they wanted to ask the Shanghai Municipal Council to order them to stop. The Shanghai Municipal Council is responsible for maintaining good governance and order within the settlement and for preventing anything that obstructs the public, given that this large gambling business is opposed by the Chinese government, opposed by the Japanese Consul-General, and opposed by the British authorities. Based on all the evidence in this case, he felt unable to find that the Shanghai Municipal Council did not have the right to close the greyhound track. Judging by common sense, he felt that the Shanghai Municipal Council had the right to do what it did.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Provisional Charity Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei has actively raised funds to help refugees in the disaster areas. This time, it also negotiated with Mr. Lin and Mr. Du Yuesheng, the chairmen of the Shanghai China Race Club, to assist the association with the Spring Golden Cup competition. A total of 110,000 tickets were issued, of which 10,000 were complimentary. For every ten tickets purchased, one complimentary ticket was given. Each ticket was sold for ten silver dollars, and the first prize was 420,000 silver dollars. 250,000 silver dollars from the ticket sales will be allocated to the relief fund. Less than half a month after the start of sales, more than half of the tickets have been sold. Currently, inquiries and requests for consignment sales are pouring in from far away, which is truly good news for the disaster victims.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Free Love and Forced Marriage <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Letter from Ms. Zhu, Ying, of this city]</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a lonely, weak woman with new ideas, living in an old-fashioned family and being forced [into marriage]. I am eighteen years old and have received a considerable education. I am very clear about the new wisdom of society. My father is a chief employee in a large merchant store of the propertied class, and his annual income is also considerable. He has a very gentle temperament, but he is a bit stubborn in his thinking. I am his only child from his first wife. He has not had any children since, and although my mother urged him to take a concubine, he always refused. Therefore, he loves me like a pearl in his palm. At the age of five, I was sent to elementary school. Because of my affinity for school, I was promoted to the second grade of junior high school, but now I have dropped out. Unfortunately, my beloved mother passed away from tuberculosis a year ago. I was very distressed at the time. Perhaps [being dead makes for an official father, don't forget begging for food]! However, my marriage problem was resolved early on. It was my late mother who made the decision. It was the [family] of a [person]. Since then, my father, because of the issue of descendants, married a young and beautiful maiden as his second wife. I was also happy to welcome her. At the beginning of my stepmother's marriage, things were still good, but gradually her temperament and personality changed completely, as if she had become a different person. Her treatment of me was also unfair. Coincidentally, near my old school, a certain student from a certain university often passed by my old school. He was a [youthful] young man. [After] [encountering] each other, because we were very compatible in [interests], it was as if we regretted meeting so late. From then on, we made mutual appointments on Sundays to visit parks and movie theaters. Over time, we developed a love that was difficult to break, and we had intimate relations. Feeling the spring breeze several times, I became pregnant. We made mutual promises to carry out a marriage revolution. His marriage was also decided by his parents, who betrothed him to a certain woman. For my sake, he is now trying to persuade his father. However, my stepmother has a nephew who is a fashionable young man. He often visits my home, and as the mistress of the house, I offer him a bit of hospitality. However, my stepmother often [spouts] words [alluding to], how [free] love should be, how men and women are equal, how her nephew is promising, etc. At first, I [resented] her for [doing this], but [unexpectedly], she [actually] betrothed me to her nephew. Because I already have a lover, I naturally refused with stern words. She [tried to persuade me], but from then on, we became alienated, and she even made false accusations to my father, gossiping about me in bed. My father, believing her words, began to mistreat me day and night. From then on, [communication was] [cut off]. Fortunately, due to my relationship with a certain student, my stepmother did not find out. We still exchanged love letters. Once, my stepmother intercepted them and showed the letters to my father, and I suffered physical pain as a result. He doesn't even know about the thing in my belly. My enemy-like fiancé sent me a letter asking me to marry him, and after opening it, I was of course ashamed and did not reply. A week later, my father and stepmother talked about preparing for the wedding. Hearing this news was heartbreaking. At this critical moment, I can't think of a solution. On the one hand, the wedding day is approaching. On the other hand, my pregnancy is gradually becoming apparent and is about to [be revealed]. Proposing a divorce is out of the question because the other party is a gentleman and my parents would not agree. Remaining in the original marriage would harm a certain student, and I have the secret of my pregnancy. Abortion poses a life-threatening risk, and I am also under the control of my parents, leaving me in a dilemma. The only option is suicide to fulfill my wishes. The above [situations] are all subject to legal constraints. I am a weak woman and have no [experience]. The situation is critical. Please, sir, provide a good solution, a proper method that is not restricted by current laws, so that I can [escape]. Fortunately, my family also reads your newspaper. Every day, I see that the difficult problems in the Reader's Consultation are properly instructed by you, benefiting [many people]. Regarding the reply, because my stepmother [is] [watchful] and it involves the issue of reputation, it is best to disclose it in the newspaper, otherwise, I am afraid things will get worse.</p>
<p>Answer: Madam, under the current social family and etiquette constraints, there is really no perfect solution to your problem. There is no choice but to (1) immediately claim illness, stay in the hospital, and firmly refuse to marry. This requires a determination to fight; (2) ask your lover, the university student, to simultaneously write home to resolutely cancel the engagement, and declare that he is already freely engaged to you in Shanghai, asking his family to acknowledge it. If the university student has this courage and determination, then the matter will be easy to handle. In any case, consensual love is unlikely to be strongly interfered with by the law. At most, your father will, based on your stepmother's words, drive you out. Then, as long as your lover does not abandon you, the two of you might as well live together. After you give birth, find some work to slowly move forward. The difficult thing is that you are both too inexperienced and did not know how to prevent pregnancy, so you have produced a third party. Your future may have fewer days of joy and more days of suffering. Moreover, for university students in Shanghai, we dare not say there are no good ones, but truly gentle and kind people who are not unfaithful are probably rare. This requires you to observe him carefully.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Results Announced for Recruitment of Copyists for Two Railways <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Two people out of more than two thousand eight hundred and thirty people</p>
<p>Fifteen officially selected, twenty-two alternates</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration recently recruited 15 copyists to be assigned to various departments. Since the advertisement for recruitment was published, up to 2,832 people have applied (with about 300 more applications arriving after the deadline, which were not counted). The personnel department was assigned to carefully select the handwriting samples submitted by each applicant, selecting 300 people with the most beautiful handwriting. The deputy director of the general affairs office, the secretary, and the head of the document section then jointly selected the 50 people with the best handwriting and asked them to come to the bureau for an interview. March 8th was the date of the interview. After the applicants registered, a doctor examined their physical condition one by one. Only those who passed the physical examination were allowed to take the exam. After the examination was completed, the director of the bureau personally gave the exam question: [Discuss the professional ethics that civil servants should have], with 40 minutes allotted for the essay and 20 minutes for the calligraphy test. Once the time was up, all papers had to be submitted, regardless of whether they were completed. It is said that the essays and calligraphy of the candidates in this exam were all excellent, and even those who did not make it in the first round were not without talent. However, due to the limited number of places, only 15 particularly outstanding people were selected. It is also said that everything in this recruitment was transparent. All the candidates' handwriting and exam papers, whether accepted or not, were [numbered] and preserved. If those who were not selected felt wronged, they could [go] to inspect [the papers] to demonstrate fairness. Those who were selected will also have a three-month probationary period. If their character or work is unsatisfactory, they will be eliminated at any time. The names of those admitted are listed below. Fifteen officially selected: Shen [Name], Mao [Name], Lu Zonghai, Zhi [Name], He Shouqin, Jiang Sisi, Shao Xiyao, [Name] Zi [Name], Ding [Name] San, Zhou Renshan, Zhu Yu [Name], Song Qimin, Su Ji, Xu Zonggan, Hong [Name] Xian.

<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Having just read the item in the "Local News" column of your esteemed newspaper of the 8th, regarding the Fook digging ticket case appeal, I was exceedingly astonished. The actual facts of the case were already described in detail in the "Local News" column of a certain newspaper on the 7th, with the headline ("[Digging and Selling Graves] Chi Lin counter-sues, Fook falsely accuses, conspires to commit perjury, accuses of extortion"). I will now refute the content published in your esteemed newspaper again: (1) The land in question is an ancestral property of Chi Lin, and all notices have been delivered by the local bailiff for many years (there are notices that can be verified). Moreover, the contract is valid, how can it be falsely claimed that it was privately printed? If there were no notices, this should be the first point of refutation. (2) Since the land is Chi Lin's ancestral property, any sale would be a sale of ancestral property. How can others interfere? Furthermore, there is no evidence of a sale. This should be the second point of refutation. (3) Regarding the so-called Zhang Sheng-tien (Zhang Guo...), Chi Lin does not know him and has never met him. How could he have requested him to mediate? This should be the third point of refutation. (4) As for the fact of destroying and digging up graves, it has already been judged by the Shanghai Special District First Court in Criminal Judgment No. 316, so there is no need for further debate. This should be the fourth point of refutation. I secretly think that Fook, disregarding his own character and fabricating facts, is merely trying to achieve his extortionist goals. Now, fearing that outsiders will not understand the truth and may mistake the false for the genuine, I hereby submit this letter of refutation, humbly requesting your chief editor to publish this letter in the news column, which would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully yours, peace. To Mr. Chief Editor of the Local News Column, respectfully, Chi Chung-lin, March 9th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: Yesterday, I read in your newspaper about a tragic accident at the First Bathhouse in Minhang, stating that the victim was rushed to the hospital but died due to "internal heat poisoning" and lack of effective medicine. This does not accord with the facts. Upon investigation, the deceased, Hui-sheng, sustained injuries and was immediately rushed to the hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the injuries were too extensive, and his advanced age made it difficult for him to recover, even with good medicine. Fearing that this may affect the reputation of the hospital involved, we request a correction. Respectfully to the Editorial Department of the Local News of Shen Bao, First Bathhouse of Minhang, March 8th.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Very polite to outsiders; endless internal strife. Shaw's humorous comment has come true again. Old Tang is very polite to outsiders; before the enemy arrives, he has already "politely yielded". The people of the whole country are furiously scolding Old Tang non-stop; is Old Tang afraid of being scolded? If he were afraid of being scolded, he wouldn't have shown you his bottom. You've already fallen for his big trick once, and you still want to get angry and scold him, wouldn't that make him laugh his jaw off? In the past, Chen Lin's proclamation to the Wu generals had a line: "His name is not worthy to sully the bamboo slips," we are afraid of soiling the ink, of course, we won't scold him. Any scolding must contain a kind of effect that stimulates the conscience of the one being scolded, but can we still move Old Tang's conscience? Therefore, for this Chairman Tang Yu-lin who declared "resistance to the end," we only have praise, no condemnation; praise him for what? Praise him for listening to the words of the humorous old man and practicing his great politeness to outsiders.</p>
<p>We don't scold Old Tang, but we should scold ourselves; we took Old Tang's solemn declaration too seriously; we believed too much in Old Tang's reports of vigorous resistance; as a result, we ate an empty soup dumpling from Old Tang. Old Tang is smart, we have all become fools, this is worth scolding ourselves for.</p>
<p>At this time of changing events, the generally ignorant and illiterate people still maintain their carefree attitude. We are again worthy of scolding ourselves! Why do we need to be literate? Why do we need to have knowledge? Why should we be so filled with righteous indignation when we receive the news of Chengde's fall? Su Dongpo said: "The beginning of life's worries is when one becomes literate." Why bother reading books? This is again worth scolding ourselves for.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Fellow Countrymen, No Need to Worry <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Jingxi</p>
<p>The news that has been coming in these past few days is truly terrible! Tang Yu-lin actually took his many concubines and ran away, leaving the land to the enemy. The people are all gnashing their teeth in hatred, unable to express their grief and indignation.</p>
<p>But wait, everyone, don't be too extreme. I advise the 400 million compatriots not to worry, and even less to be saddened. You should know that the loss of the Northeast, the fall of Shanhaiguan, and the presentation of Rehe to Japan were all marked on the world map by God long ago. Furthermore, alas! (Praise!) The few unprecedented and unsurpassed prophetic doctors in China, like Jiang Ziya, Zhuge Liang, Li Chunfeng, and Liu Bowen, couldn't bear to see later generations die of anxiety, and had already written special collections, hinting at these events to us. No matter what time or dynasty, the appearance of a world-shaking hero or a beauty who could topple a kingdom in times of chaos is all included; all that's needed is for everyone to carefully investigate!</p>
<p>In short, everything under heaven is predetermined, and human effort cannot change fate. Even if Japan swallows the whole of China, it is also predestined by heaven. Can humans force it?</p>
<p>However, if your wife is in Tianjin, or your son is in Beiping, and you're a little worried, then you can go to the Four Horses Road and buy a copy of the special collection mentioned above, take a close look at it, and then you'll have a clue as to what will happen to Tianjin and Beiping, the Yangtze River, and the Southwest. If you have a clue, you'll have a way to be at ease.</p>
<p>Alas! National destruction is predestined by heaven! Why bother shouting and fighting so hard, my compatriots!</p>
<p>Let's sing while drinking, how much is life? Spring has arrived, let us enjoy ourselves in time!</p>
<h3 id="e122">Big Pancake Movement <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Ming</p>
<p>According to reports, the workers of Yenching University, in view of the shortage of food at the front lines, have spontaneously launched a big pancake movement. The pancakes are as big as woks, about two feet in diameter and three inches thick, each weighing about ten pounds. They are requesting people from all walks of life to imitate and donate them (see the Shen Bao education column). Big pancakes are a staple food in the north. Recently, after listening to the wonderful melodies of the storytelling drums, I realized that storytelling drums are truly wonderful folk literature. They are both better than Peking opera in terms of superficiality and not as obscure as Kun opera. The emotions and writing are vivid, the descriptions are satisfying, and the structure is well-organized. The art of landscape painting makes good use of reduplicative words, vividly capturing the quiet, soft, affectionate, miserable, and dark atmosphere. The "blood stained sleeves, fragrant lips cold, moonlight shines on palace shoes showing red" in the Long Ban Slope section can be placed in the prose of the Six Dynasties without any awkwardness.</p>
<p>Xiao Hei's songs are like the Yangtze River, flowing a thousand miles at a stretch, and are sometimes interspersed with exclamatory interjections. The sound of ripping silk startles the entire audience. Her voice is extremely beautiful and can convey emotions subtly and silently. In the blink of an eye, everyone understands her feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and they change their expressions and lean forward to listen.</p>
<p>Truly, the storytelling drums are not an easy task. Without a stage, they use scenery to enhance their art, and they also lack brocade costumes to enhance their color. With just one drum and one string, they wander in a confined space and try to captivate the audience with great magic. Aside from Xiao Hei, I have rarely seen such talent. When she raises her eyebrows, waves her sleeves, and sings at the top of her voice, she is boundless and sees no one else. She is one with her art, and her spirit is sent into the song. She is truly a heroine of our time and no longer just an ordinary drum girl. (Ti Gong)</p>
<p>As for food, in the South, "big pancakes" and "fried dough sticks" are considered sisters. But the big pancakes that we usually see, although called big, actually weigh no more than two or three pounds. Now, the big pancakes specially made by the workers of Yenching University have actually broken all big pancake records and weigh up to ten pounds. I don't know what to call them, so I'll call them "Big Big Pancakes." If we were to translate it into foreign languages, it should be: BiggestBigCake, right?</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen many national salvation movements in the country, such as the aviation salvation movement, tea dance salvation movement, domestic goods movement, flower country election movement, and the Guangdong jade face salvation movement. Truly, they are abundant and beautiful beyond description. However, I have not seen any that embody the meaning of proletarian salvation in the movement. If there are any, it probably started with the big pancake movement. Song for the Big Pancake Movement (regardless of old poetic rhyme):</p>
<p>Big pancake, big pancake, big big pancake, made with domestic wheat flour, two feet in diameter and weighing ten pounds, the best among big pancakes. The northern wind blows snow, the mountains are cold, the brave soldiers are fighting, hungry and cold, having this big pancake to fill their bellies, chewing and pouring out their hatred. Suddenly, it is reported that the enemy has captured the city of Rehe, and the commander-in-chief has fled without a trace. High officials have delicacies to eat, how could they be willing to eat big pancakes on the battlefield! The big pancake is given to brave soldiers, eat it and aim well with the gun. Comrades of the same big pancake, soldiers and workers hold hands tightly, let the rich stink with wine and meat, big pancakes and fried dough sticks are eternal! The proletariat knows hunger and cold, resisting the enemy starts with food.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Ghost Money <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The same colorful pieces of paper, some are real, some are fake, and there is also a kind of "ghost money" for use in the underworld. There are so many kinds of banknotes, we can't count them all at once, no matter what bank issued them. Counterfeit banknotes circulate into our hands without us knowing, and the impact we suffer is great. But in this society where education is not widespread and illiterate people fill the entire society, ghost money – paper used by ghosts – has a great impact on the average, foolish masses, especially the women in the countryside and farmers in our inland areas, who are not easily acquainted with banknotes. The losses they suffer from ghost money being confused with real money are truly not uncommon.</p>
<p>Chinese people are used to mystification. They don't vigorously do practical work in the real society, but they are very authentic in planning the economic problems of the ghosts in the illusory and strange underworld. In the past, the people burned paper money and silver ingots for their ancestors. Now there are paper silver dollars and banknotes issued by underworld banks. Their shape and color are no different from real ones. Paper silver dollars are light in weight, and we know at a glance that they are for ghost use. Underworld banknotes and real banknotes – the only difference is in the writing – do not distinguish between above and below. Illiterate friends are deceived and receive them in their hands, and they really can't tell the difference between real and fake.</p>
<p>The place where the underworld bank is established is in Java. The paper money it issues is of a non-convertible nature. This kind of paper money circulates in Chinese society, specifically for the silly guys who can't read to have fun. Speaking of which, there are so many kinds of money used by Chinese ghosts, no wonder some mischievous ghosts say that although the Chinese people are poor, the ancestors of the Chinese people are not poor. Alas! Due to the superstition of theocracy, things that are popular for a while are poisonous to society. Instead of watching this ghost money harm ignorant men and women, we might as well prohibit its issuance.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Pushing Food with Earnest Hospitality, Inviting Poor Women, Remembering Entering the Gate, Generously Leaving, Possessing a Military Man's Valor</p>
<p>Old Miss had always been a Beijing girl who came and went freely, but now she was suddenly told that she was not allowed to leave the house, how could this be done. So on this day, the Jiang family kept a straight face, and Old Miss was embarrassed to go out. But the next morning, she still went to the Haihong Street to buy things. When she left the house, the Jiang family was thinking that it would be good if she came back quickly. Unexpectedly, her going out today was exactly the opposite of her mother's intentions. She had been gone for a long time and had not yet returned. The Jiang family became anxious and restless in the house, and ran to the gate to look around. After waiting for a long time, her own daughter had not returned, but a military officer rode a sorrel high horse and walked to the gate. This place was not far from the Xiyuan barracks, and there were soldiers coming and going every day, so a riding military officer passing by was not unusual, and she did not pay much attention to it. Unexpectedly, the tall sorrel horse stopped suddenly in front of her, and the officer got off the horse, holding a horse whip in his hand, and stood straight in front of the Jiang family. The Jiang family was caught off guard and startled, and holding the door, she took two steps back. The officer was not the kind of person she expected. The horse whip in his hand drooped down, and with that hand, he took off his hat and nodded at her with a smile, saying: Old lady, do you also live in this house? Seeing that he was very polite and did not have any rude habits, the Jiang family also put on a smile and replied: That's right, we live here. What are you looking for, sir? The officer smiled and said: I'm not looking for anyone. My name is Zhao Ziqiang, a company commander, currently stationed in the Xiyuan camp. My old man wants to bring a servant and move into the backyard. I've rented your backyard house, and we'll be neighbors from now on. Please take care of me if anything happens. As soon as the Jiang family heard that a military officer had rented the backyard, an unpleasant impression had already been left in her mind. Now seeing that Zhao Ziqiang was not the unreasonable type, she was halfway reconciled. She smiled and said: We are poor people, just a mother and daughter. We'll have to ask you to take care of us in everything. Zhao Ziqiang tied the horse to the stone pillar outside the gate and walked in, asking: Old lady, what is your honorable surname? The Jiang family smiled and said: Why are you calling me that? I don't deserve it; my surname is Yang. (7)</p>

<p>At the end of last year, the National Union of Women's Institutes in London held an exhibition, and the women of England all put out their own handicrafts to compete for novelty and beauty. Among them, there was a beautifully decorated shoebox. The Queen of England repeatedly attended the exhibition to view it, and she loved this shoebox very much, wanting to buy it at a high price. However, the items displayed in the exhibition were all not for sale, and it was never allowed for the exhibitors to sell them as an exception. The Queen tried every means to ask the exhibitor to intercede, but she could not get her permission. Later, the Women's Institute held several review meetings specifically for this matter. As a result, they could not force the exhibitor to sell it because of the Queen's fondness, and the Queen had no way to obtain the shoebox.</p>

<p>The state of Pennsylvania in the United States has built an extremely luxurious prison in Roswell, with various facilities modeled after the best hotels. The exterior looks like a palace, and the construction cost as much as seven million dollars. The interior rooms are more beautifully decorated than high-end hotels, with sofas, lounge chairs, wardrobes, hot and cold water, etc., all complete. Outside there are also large living rooms, dining rooms, entertainment venues, reading rooms, libraries, and sports fields. Therefore, it is called a hotel-style prison. The intention is to allow prisoners to improve their minds in this exquisite prison. When they are released, they are treated the same as graduates from specialized schools. Therefore, many prisoners dare not commit crimes again after being released.</p>

<p>A German technician recently invented a new type of gas mask that can prevent any kind of poison gas. He wanted to sell the exclusive rights to this newly invented gas mask to a domestic military supplies factory, but because he was not given preferential treatment, he was very unwilling. He then sold it to his enemy, France. French military officials saw this new type of gas mask and were willing to pay a huge amount of royalties. Later, this news was detected by the German military authorities, and they all regretted it.</p>

<p>The British army uses a volunteer soldier system. Currently, most of the British army are Great War babies. What are Great War babies? It refers to infants who were born or breastfed during the European War era. We recall that it has been nineteen years since the Great War began in 1914. The children who were born at that time are now young people around twenty years old. Therefore, in the current British army, Great War babies account for about eighty-five percent.</p>

<p>There is a barbershop in London whose owner's ancestors were collectors. Among the antiques they collected, there were four pearls that were identified by British geologists as rare antiques from nine million years ago. Legend has it that these pearls were the treasures of an Irish tycoon. Experts have now made a detailed assessment of the special features of the pearls: first, the pearl shape is very small, less than one-tenth of an ordinary pearl. The inside and outside both have the same mother-of-pearl. From the outside, it belongs to a species of true pearl shell that has already become extinct in ancient times. These pearls have a history. At first, they were tribute from the Spanish allied countries to King Ayutle of Denagor. Later, they were passed down from the king to his descendants, but it is no longer possible to find out when they fell into the hands of the barbershop owner's ancestors. Therefore, its value is truly priceless.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, have you seen why there are two buttons on the back of the buttocks of a suit dress uniform? This is because in the past, when there were no trains, cars, or trams, people mostly traveled by horse. However, when riding on horseback, you should roll up the two lapels of your coat and fasten them with the buttons on the side of your buttocks, so that you can avoid various obstacles. Therefore, the buttons on the back of the buttocks of dress uniforms are still left over to this day.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 9th dispatch) The Ministry of Education issued a circular to various provincial and city departments, stating that the previous order for free tuition for students in disaster areas was intended for specific facts that could be verified as evidence of suffering from disasters. Recently, it has been found that many students in various schools are using the current general disaster situation in various parts of our country as a basis. The county government prepares a letter of proof, and many county government officials add a unified annotation, which is generally forwarded, which is inconsistent with the original order. The original order should be explained separately, so that the various schools are aware of it, and announce it to the students, so that everyone is aware of it.</p>

<p>Four-Year Compulsory Education System Has Been Completed</p>
<p>Literacy Rate Increased from 33% to 90%</p>
<p>Thousands of Universities, Industrial Schools, and Holiday Remedial Schools Added</p>
<p>(TASS Moscow Dispatch) When the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union held its third congress, Bubnov, the People's Commissar of Education, reported to the public on the progress of culture and education in the Soviet Union during the first five-year plan. According to him, during this period, the development of various cultural and educational undertakings in the Soviet Union has exceeded the plan's expectations. For example, according to the plan, the educational expenses were 762.8 million rubles, but as a result, 155 billion rubles have been spent in four years and three months. Among them, 703.2 million rubles were used to train cadres, 700.4 million rubles were used for mass education, and 146.3 million rubles were used for scientific and research work. In the national cultural and educational expenses, the expenditure used to train cadres has increased year by year. In 1928, this expenditure accounted for 30.6%, and in 1932, it increased to 50.6%. The gradual increase in cultural work expenses in various republics is sufficient to prove the improvement of the cultural standards of general "backward" ethnic groups. The following is a table showing the increase in cultural and educational expenses in various republics in four years (1928 to 1932) (taking 1928 as 100 points):</p>
<p>Percentage</p>
<p>Russian Republic 239</p>
<p>Belarus Republic 331</p>
<p>Uzbek Republic 426</p>
<p>Tajikistan Republic 696</p>
<p>Turkmenistan Republic 710</p>
<p>In the past four years, thousands of new schools, industrial schools, colleges, and holiday remedial schools have been added. At the beginning of 1933, there were 485,000 male and female students studying in universities and industrial schools, and 1.5 million students studying in holiday industrial remedial schools. In 1922, there were only 57,000 engineers and technicians with university education in the entire Soviet Union. In 1932, it had increased to 216,000. As for mass education, the Soviet Union has made significant progress in implementing compulsory primary education. According to the original plan, the deadline for completing the compulsory education system in the Ukrainian Republic was 1934, the Belarus Republic was 1935, the Transcaucasian Republic was 1936, the Russian Republic was 1937, and the Central Asian Republics were 1940. But according to the facts, the four-year compulsory education system has been completed in 1932, and the seven-year compulsory education system has also been implemented. Moreover, the Soviet Union has achieved exceptional success in eliminating illiteracy. According to the first five-year plan, eliminating illiteracy could reach 17 million people, but in four years and three months, 29 million illiterate people became literate, and 17.7 million semi-literate people received supplementary education. In 1913, the literacy rate in the entire Russia was 35%. In 1932, it increased to 90%. Other "backward" ethnic groups also had the same increase in literacy. During the same period, the literacy rate in Uzbekistan increased from 2% to 72%, in Tajikistan from 1.5% to 52%, and in Turkmenistan from 2% to 61%. Also, according to the original plan, by the end of the five-year plan, the number of children entering kindergartens and "children's homes" could reach 900,000, but the actual number has now reached 5.2 million.</p>

<p>丨Jiangsu Education Department Issues Concrete Plans for County Governments to Implement丨</p>
<p>B. For specially contracted farmland, the selection of seeds, fertilization, planting, use of agricultural tools, and pest control must all be carried out according to the guidance of the various institutions. The required seeds must also be selected and supplied by the institutions.</p>
<p>C. The establishment of specially contracted farmland should strive for distribution throughout the district and be clearly marked as such.</p>
<p>D. If a specially contracted farmland, due to special circumstances, fails to achieve the originally planned harvest results, resulting in losses for the landowner, the institution may provide an appropriate subsidy.</p>
<p>E. If a specially contracted farmland achieves excellent results, the landowner should be given appropriate rewards.</p>
<p>F. If a specially contracted farmland has achieved considerable success, the contract may be appropriately terminated, and other farmland may be contracted as specially contracted farmland.</p>
<p>3. In addition to establishing model farms and specially contracted farms, if county-level farmers' education centers have larger-scale farmland, they should also designate experimental farmland. The regulations for this are as follows:</p>

<p>Yang Lian and Guo Youshou Arrive in Shanghai; Remaining Members Expected to Return in Early April</p>
<p>European Education Has Many Advantages That China Can Learn From</p>
<h3 id="e138">### The Return Journey of Group Members <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The European Education Inspection Group, since being commissioned by the government to go to Europe to carry out its work in August of last year, has now been working for seven months. The situation of its investigation in various countries has been reported in various newspapers. The group completed its investigation in Soviet Russia in mid-February and telegraphed the Ministry of Education to report the end of the European investigation. It immediately received an order from the Ministry to return home immediately. Group members Yang Kang and Guo Youshou took the Siberian Railway from Moscow, took a train through Vladivostok to return home. The remaining group members, Cheng Qibao and Li Ximou, went from Moscow to Geneva to wait for a boat back home. Li Jiaxiang went from Moscow to Vienna and Berlin, then took a boat from Hamburg to return home. The group still had a lot of materials and luggage stored in Vienna, Berlin, Paris, and Geneva, so they went to retrieve them separately. The two of Yang and Guo, due to domestic official duties, (Mr. Yang is a professor at Peking University, and Mr. Guo is a section chief in the Ministry of Education,) had to take the quickest route to avoid a long absence from their posts. Mr. Guo and Mr. Yang arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 9th) on the same ship as Chiang Tso-pin, the President Cleveland. A reporter from the Da Bai News Agency immediately went to interview them. The two looked refreshed but extremely exhausted, as they had just completed seven months of work, followed by more than twenty days of trains and ships. Their hardship was extraordinary. The two will soon return to Beijing to report on their mission. The reporter from the Da Bai News Agency exchanged a few words of greeting with Mr. Yang and Mr. Guo and then raised the following questions, to which they gave detailed answers. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e139">### Weaknesses of Our Country's Education <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Question: What is the mission and organization of the European Education Inspection Group?</p>
<p>Answer: Since the Qing Dynasty changed the school system and implemented the new education, it has been more than thirty years, which can be said to be not short. Although educational achievements have gradually increased, they have not been very significant and cannot meet the expectations of those who are enthusiastic about education. Most educators blame the poor school system. Although it has been changed many times, it is still ineffective. Some say that the teaching method is improper. Therefore, the five-stage teaching method, the heuristic teaching method, the design teaching method, and the Dalton teaching method, all the new teaching methods created in Europe and the United States have been introduced one after another. However, the educational achievements are still not obvious. Some people think that outsiders see more clearly, so it is better to invite foreign educators to China to inspect and listen to their opinions for reference. Therefore, Dr. John Dewey, Dr. Paul Monroe, Dr. Romiett Stevens, Dr. Elwood P. Cubberley, and so on from the United States came to China one after another, and we benefited a lot. However, fewer European educators have come to China to inspect education, and they have few concrete opinions on the construction of our country's education that can be used for our reference. Moreover, there are many students studying education in the United States, and few studying education in European countries. Therefore, the Chinese people are clearer about the American education system and its advantages than about the situation of European education.</p>
<h3 id="e140">### Group Member Organization Mission <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Studying the advantages of European and American education and listening to the concrete criticisms of European and American educators on our country's education are equally important in improving our country's education. Therefore, the government authorities have long intended to send experts to Europe to investigate education and to invite European educators to China to inspect education. In the second half of the year before last, the League of Nations sent Mr. Becker, the former Prussian Minister of Education, Mr. Paul Hazard, a professor at the French National Academy, Mr. R.H. Tawney, a professor at the University of London, and Mr. Wazyk, an educational expert from the Polish Ministry of Education, to China to inspect education. Zhu Jiaji, the Minister of Education of our country, also began to select personnel to organize the European Education Inspection Group. Initially, Cheng Qibao, Yang Kang, Li Ximou, Guo Youshou, and Hang Liwu were appointed. Later, Mr. Hang could not spare the time due to other matters, so Li Jiaxiang was appointed instead. After the five of us were appointed, we gathered in Nanjing to prepare our luggage and ask the Ministry of Education to indicate the scope of the investigation and the points that should be paid special attention to. At the same time, we also sought the expectations of domestic educators for our mission. We held two meetings at the Ministry of Education and received much guidance from the Vice Minister and others. We discussed with educators in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jinan, and other places and obtained many opinions. However, the time between being appointed and departing was very short, so we could not listen to the opinions of domestic educators as much as we hoped, which is regrettable. In total, the most important aspects of the expectations of all parties for our mission are five points:</p>
<p>1. Investigate the educational system and current situation of each country.</p>
<p>2. Seek foreign reference materials for Chinese education problems in order to make it easier to solve them.</p>
<p>3. Seek to connect the Chinese education community with the education communities of European countries in order to obtain mutual benefits in academic research and enhance international friendship.</p>
<p>4. Collect materials for educational research.</p>
<p>5. Pay attention to the trends of new education in various countries.</p>
<p>Among these five items, the second item is the most important. Because of the burning educational situation in our country, there are many problems that are difficult to solve. Therefore, all parties submitted hundreds of questions to us. We made consistent efforts to search for and study the above five points and other points that should be paid attention to. However, in order to concentrate our efforts, we divided the work vertically. Guo Youshou paid special attention to higher education, Yang Lian paid special attention to secondary education, Cheng Qibao paid special attention to elementary education, Li Ximou paid special attention to vocational education, and Li Jiaxiang paid special attention to social education and educational administration. The five were jointly responsible. Teacher training was jointly undertaken by Yang Lian and Cheng Qibao. (End)</p>

<p>US Has Plan to Buy Raw Silver</p>
<p>Reuters, London, March 8 Montagu &amp; Co. reported that the US ban on silver exports has made silver sellers cautious, and there are many speculative buyers, especially in India. Today, due to President Roosevelt's plan to propose to Congress tomorrow that the government purchase silver and increase the silver content of auxiliary coins, speculative buying is even more prevalent. Today, China resold a large amount of silver, but this type of limit order can be undoubtedly assumed, because China has not yet received news from the United States, so the supply is greater than speculative buying. From the current observation, silver will continue to rise, but the reasons are not yet fully understood.</p>

<h3 id="e172">The Serious Situation in Tianjin Affects Public Bonds <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Overall Decline of 1-2 Jiao to 7-8 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bonds of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange slightly rebounded. However, as the situation in Tianjin becomes more and more serious, and at a time when retail investors are gradually changing their mindset to bullish, market prices are gradually becoming weaker. It can be seen that there are many powerful figures on the bullish side, but there are also a considerable number of unsubstantiated ones. In this extremely serious situation, if the bullish defenses were to shake, market price changes would be very drastic. Therefore, at this time, the security situation in Tianjin is the most important and noteworthy aspect of the market. At the opening yesterday morning, the Northern Gang sold off heavily, and market prices plummeted by 7-8 jiao, but retail investors in the Unified Salt Tax still had needs, so it rebounded by 1-2 jiao. In the second round, sentiment was slightly stronger, and the 47th issue was slightly bought in, rebounding higher by 2-4 jiao. In the afternoon, news spread that the situation in Tianjin was very urgent, and buyers became scarce. Both the 34th and 4th issues were sold off, and market prices in both rounds declined by 3-4 jiao to 5 jiao with each passing round. The situation already showed signs of decline, resulting in a consistent decline of 1-2 jiao to as much as 7-8 jiao. According to the current relationship between market price fluctuations and the situation outside the pass, it seems that there is no longer a close connection. Whether Tianjin will be drawn into the whirlpool has become an unsolvable mystery for the entire country, and it is not only related to the rise and fall of the bond market. Trading saw a sharp decrease yesterday, with a total transaction volume of 6,053,000 yuan, of which 3,000 yuan were in spot goods, and futures for the salt tax were only 1.39 million, and reductions and unified taxes were both less than 1 million, with the rest only ranging from tens of thousands to 600,000.</p>

<p>Very Few Transactions, Extremely Many Empty Positions</p>
<p>The yarn market is extremely flat and lifeless. The US cotton market is shut down, and there are many conflicting rumors, making it even more difficult for people to settle down. Because of this, cautious people are all taking a downsizing approach, and are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards business. Transactions are very rare, and there are many empty positions that are sold off, with no changes in the market.</p>

<p>The cotton market is quiet. American cotton is closed, and people are uncertain and hesitant to act rashly, so business is very slow. We must wait for the opening of the American cotton market to determine the outcome. However, Indian cotton has risen by 5.6 rupees, but the exchange rate has eased, making it difficult to boost confidence. According to private telegraphic news, the American cotton market will open tomorrow, and it is said that the price will rise by about 100 pounds.</p>

<p>Yesterday, British cotton futures rose 10 to 11 points, spot prices rose 20 points, Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 27 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to speculative buying, but later returned due to selling by European exporters. It is estimated that Ping Guo Er rose by 4.75 rupees, and Aomula and Bai Luo Xi rose by 5.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (dated the 8th):</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Shipments are unresolved, and there are no sources. However, goods transported by rail from various places arrive continuously, and the desire to sell off stock is strong, but the sales market is very quiet. Therefore, people's minds are even more uncertain, and even if they voluntarily lower prices, there is no great demand, resulting in a slump. According to this situation, it will be difficult to recover in a short time. Therefore, the selling price of Kai rice has fallen by more than a corner. Only Yin Yuan Yang Jian is still able to stand firm. Factory goods have no honor or disgrace. (Hu Bei) Yesterday, ships from Xiaogang, Hexia, arrived in Shanghai numbered 45. Rail transport continued to arrive at the port. White polished rice sales were high, and good quality rice was transacted slightly, medium and lower quality rice was sluggish. The situation is that high-quality rice is stable, medium and lower quality rice is weak. Early rice shows a slightly soft trend. Yang Du Jian and Ke Jian are still stable, while Bai Yuan shows a weary trend.</p>

<p>| 8,000 Bags of New and Old Xiao Jiao Sold |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the guest market was still active. Even foreign rice, which had not been traded for a long time, sold 4,000 bags each of new and old Xiao Jiao rice, which were taken by military demand. The market showed a relatively strong upturn. 4,000 bags of new Xiao Jiao were priced at 7 yuan and 7 jiao 4 fen, and 4,000 bags of old Xiao Jiao were priced at 7 yuan and 4 jiao 5 fen, which was 1 jiao 8 fen higher than the previous selling price. They were sold by the British firm Xiang Mao Yanghang. There is still a lot of foreign rice in stock, but it is all in the hands of foreign merchants who are unwilling to sell off cheaply. After this batch is sold, the subsequent prices will not fall.</p>
<p>Yesterday, several hundred bags of Ke Xian rice arrived by Lao Xiangtai Wheel, and other scattered bags also arrived, totaling about 1,000 bags. Sales in this street were flat because Hexia rice has been arriving recently. However, the appetite in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, is very strong, and Quanzhou is also buying. Yesterday, this street handled more than 700 bags, and the Fujian merchants took more than 3,500 bags in total. The market price increased by one or two fen. It is estimated that 2,000 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan rice were sold, priced at 8 yuan 7 jiao 7 fen to 8 yuan 4 jiao 5 jiao, and 535 bags of Hunan Ji You were sold, priced at 8 yuan 7 jiao to 8 yuan 6 jiao 4 fen.

<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a generally flat and weary trend in the morning and afternoon. The quoted price of Kan wheat fell by another two or three jiao. According to this situation, it seems that the increase in foreign agricultural products is not yet the time. Therefore, people's minds became scattered. The market in this month was slightly better amidst the weariness, because the Yingkou merchant group had some needs, and the standard situation became stable. As for the Liaoning futures market, the buying interest from both inside and outside the industry was unusually sluggish, and the sale of Australian wheat was also active. It is said that the forward order was reduced by only three liang and four qian half. This situation is tantamount to foreign wheat still having to be dumped, and the lack of confidence is due to this. As a result, this month was down by a small 2 li and a half from the previous day, April was down by a small 2 li and a half, May and June were down by a small 7 li and a half, July was down by 1 fen, and August was down by 1 fen and 2 li and a half.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was unusually quiet after the opening in the morning. There were no transactions from March to June. Only a few cars were traded in July and August. The market atmosphere was flat and weary. Until the opening in the afternoon, this month was initially firm and stable, opening at 3 liang 2 qian 3 fen, but then the bulls sold off strongly, and although the shorts also made up positions, the market atmosphere was quiet again. April was also weak due to the recent situation and the fact that foreign wheat could be imported in a continuous stream. The prices of futures months also fell due to the sale of foreign wheat and the panic of buyers. As a result, this month was down by 1 fen from the previous day, April was down by 3 fen, and July and August were down by 2 fen.</p>

<p>The red grain market has been stable for a long time, with not much arriving and in stock. However, its demand is not very large, and the market situation is always stable. Yesterday, the Jiangbei merchants' purchases suddenly increased, and the market price immediately rose by five or six fen. A total of six cars of red-shelled grain were traded, with prices opening at 2 liang 4 qian 5 fen and a half to 2 liang 4 qian 3 fen. Four cars of red-shelled grain were priced at 2 liang 4 qian, and another six cars of ordinary goods were priced at 2 liang 3 qian 6 fen and a half, which were purchased by the inland.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was still weary due to the decline in the silver standard and the shrinking of the Dutch exchange rate. The Public Association divided the market for No. 24 coarse sand white. The initial price was 15 liang and 1 qian, but there were no takers. Later, a small transaction was made with 05 fen.

Taikoo Sugar B brand was 16 liang 05 fen, CW brand was 15 liang 9 qian, DY brand was 15 liang 7 qian 5, HX Lai was 15 liang 6 qian half, and this factory's cotton white was slightly opened, No. 1 was 14 liang 4 qian, No. 2 was 14 liang, No. 3 was 13 liang 4 qian. The Chao merchants opened thousands of pieces of Bingbai sugar, priced at 15 liang 7 qian. The secret price of raw red sugar was slightly loose, but transactions were extremely rare.

<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port became more and more silent due to the tense foreign exchange market. Under this environment, European and American firms were unable to transfer overseas silk telegrams and had nothing to follow. They did not dare to sell or buy current or futures silk. Chinese silk merchants were also waiting for the opportunity to make progress because their costs were heavily in debt. Yesterday, only Yin Zhuang Sansheng entered five bales of Yi Chang brand No. 2 Bao Mian yellow raw silk, priced at 390 liang. Xin Shi Chang entered ten bales of Tong He brand top No. 1 Qili white dried warp silk, priced at 405 liang.</p>

<p>There were over 70,000 bales in stock during the same period last year.</p>
<p>The Bank of America's suspension of exchange is raging. The New York Raw Silk Exchange's futures silk has long been suspended from auction. The current silk market has also been suspended due to the drastic changes in the foreign exchange market. However, the sales of Japanese silk to the United States have been quite strong in the recent ten days. Due to the financial crisis, silk weaving factories have generally reduced production and focused on artificial silk fabrics to reduce costs. As a result, raw silk consumption has been greatly reduced and the stock of silk has not been weakened. According to news from the American silk merchant firm, although the spot and futures silk trade in the New York City market has been affected by the silver tide and has been suspended, there are still 65,835 bales of silk in stock in the city, and there were more than 70,000 bales in stock at this time last year, enough to meet the demand of all silk weaving factories in the city for more than a month.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Why [Liberation]! <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>These days, the Free Talk is debating Mr. Zeng's so-called [liberated words], which is very lively. I have not read that [Special Issue on the Liberation Movement of Words], but I have only seen the two poems quoted by various authors in the Free Talk, Mr. Zeng's [immortal works]. There are many wonderful things in the world that are [beyond expectation]. For example, a few years ago, a gentleman [discovered] that Mozi was an Indian, and made many [researches] as if it were a serious matter. And now there is Mr. Zeng's [Movement for the Liberation of Words], which is an even more advanced way of selling savages' heads.</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng's [immortal works] have been criticized by many gentlemen, so I will not elaborate on them here. Let's talk about what liberation is.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a kind of [liberation movement] in literature and art does not arise out of thin air. First of all, there must be a conflict between old and new ideas in society. When new ideas need to be expressed in a literary and artistic way, it is felt that the old literary and artistic system is not applicable, so a new style is created. In this way, when new content produces a new form, it can be regarded as a kind of [liberation] in literature and art.</p>
<p>The current vernacular poetry, in relation to the old-style poetry, is a kind of liberation; because the two are not only different in form, but also completely different in the ideas and consciousness contained in them. But there are exceptions to this. Recently, many vernacular poems are actually the adopted sons of feudal thought in terms of ideological consciousness, from the groaning of poverty and resentment to the new love descriptions of talented scholars and beautiful women, all of which are the thin shadows of feudal poets; although they are ostensibly vernacular poems, selling old goods in new stores, the difference between this kind of vernacular poetry and old-style poetry is just like the difference between ancient style and rhythm in old-style poetry. Mr. Zeng's many vernacular poems are actually such adopted sons of old-style poetry. Therefore, it is a more honest way for him to fill in new words for [playing mahjong] completely according to the old rhythm of words. It is enough to remove the savage head of what [liberation] is! Wouldn't that save a lot of talk? And don't you see that another new word artist, Mr. Zhang, has already taken over the mantle of Nalan Xingde and become [immortal] without wearing the savage head of [liberation]?</p>
<h3 id="e192">Stupid Thief <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Jianfu</p>
<p>In today's smoky literary world, many people who are close to printing houses publish their books in large numbers. Although they can cheat a few coins, [play mahjong,] they cause no small harm to a group of pure young people. If this kind of automatic kaleidoscope is not exposed, the Chinese people may only sing [the peace of the false country] forever.</p>
<p>Since publications such as Free Talk and Analects exposed the truth about Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zeng, we have at least recognized what modern [white depiction masters] and [liberation experts] are. Mr. Zhang not only stole the entire song Lang Taosha from Nalan Xingde, but also the fourth sentence of his representative work, the first song of Yulouchun, [The most unbearable thing is to look back in the bright moon], is still stolen from the sentence [The old country is unbearable to look back in the bright moon] by the late lord. Changing the two words [old country] to [most is] is not something that any petty thief of a word artist can do, but unexpectedly it has become Mr. Zhang's swan song. This kind of [orthodox faction] is like the disciple of Liangshanbo Shiqian. If this kind of [white depiction master] is not called [word thief], what should he be called?</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang uses the [Huizhou] accent for the level tones of the words, but unfortunately, his master Hu Shi's Huizhou accent is different from his. We must first learn the [Huizhou] accent from Mr. Zhang to be able to read the first two sentences of his Yulouchun [The misty morning smoke shrouds the green trees, children lead calves to the stream] and the first sentence of his Bodhisattva Man [The man is floating clouds and I am catkins] smoothly. No wonder Liu Yazi scolded him [spreading errors, harming young people].</p>
<p>The liberation theory of the liberation master, Mr. Zeng, is even more ridiculous. He said:</p>
<p>(1) A word must have a score, otherwise it is no different from a poem, because a word has a musical relationship, so</p>
<p>(2) A word must pay attention to level tones; but there is no need to talk about yangping yinping, regardless of shang qu ru.</p>
<p>(3) Word sentences should be completely white depiction, or close to vernacular simple classical Chinese, and absolutely no allusions or deep and outdated classical Chinese should be used, which is (1) no liberation, (2) half liberation, (3) full liberation.</p>
<p>This is his [one-third five] liberation. Although we do not know how (1) no liberation and (3) full liberation can be consistent, we must use scores, have level tones, and use white depiction. In fact, it is the old technique of the Tang and Five Dynasties words, even later Dongpo and Jiaxuan are the same. When Dongpo wrote words, he sometimes changed the length of the sentences at will. In ancient times, words were a kind of popular literature. The works of the word artists of the Tang and Five Dynasties and the word saint Li Houzhu were basically white depiction. There was no need to use allusions and deep and outdated classical Chinese at all. Therefore, there is no need for the liberation of modern people. Zhang Mi's Jiangchengzi [It's good to ask him if he came, and smiled and said, don't be sentimental], Song Li Qingzhao's Ru Meng Ling [Who accompanies me to sit alone by the bright window, I and the shadow are two, when the lamp is exhausted and I want to sleep, the shadow also throws people away, helpless, helpless, what a desolate me]. Isn't this vernacular? The Yinshici and Cimaoci of Qing Nalan Xingde, and the Hualianci of Wu Pingxiang, are all excellent works. Who used allusions? Who used deep and outdated classical Chinese? Words were originally vernacular. [Wherever there is well water to drink, someone will sing Willow words]. If it is classical Chinese, how can these water carriers and villagers standing by the well drinking water understand and sing them? Only the declining word artists after the Southern Song Dynasty liked to use allusions, but this is already an inferior work. People who truly understand and love words in ancient and modern times all respect the words before the Southern Song Dynasty. Later generations abandoned the fundamentals and pursued the trivial, leaving only laughter, so the three major propositions put forward by Mr. Zeng are originally the origin of words. Why bother to do this after thousands of years? Mr. Zeng's liberation theory is not a theory at all, let alone a movement.</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng was originally an ignorant and incompetent thing, a petty thief like Mr. Zhang. His most proud masterpiece, and praised by the ignorant as [soul-stirring] [immortal masterpiece], Zuihuayin:</p>
<p>[I am too weak to relieve the long day in illness, and my loneliness is as before. I go to the flower shade alone, and I only feel the fragrance filling my sleeves in the midst of myriad purples and reds. The flowers accompany me after dusk, and my heart is first revealed when I am drunk. How can I not be bewitched, such spring light is only suitable for Jiangnan to have.]</p>
<p>It was copied from Li Qingzhao's Zuihuayin. How can he still have the face to publish it! Those who are good at being thieves always make it difficult for people to discover their stolen goods, but Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zeng stole other people's land to be their family gods, which is too stupid to be pitied.</p>
<p>Originally, Mr. Zeng wanted to continue [Hu Shi's attempt to succeed], but unfortunately, the immortal famous sentence [What does he care] can only be thrown into the toilet, rotting with excrement!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to advise a group of young people, if you are interested in words, you can buy Tang Wudai words, Bei Song Zhujia words, and Qing Nalan Xingde's words to read, but you must never buy the words [released] by those [word thieves] who boast about themselves, otherwise, you will be greatly deceived!</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Woman Selling Egg Slices <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Wanrong</p>
<p>I have liked to eat egg slices since I was a child. They are yellow, fragrant, sweet, and crispy, which is really delicious! Every day at about two o'clock in the afternoon, there is a cry for selling egg slices in the alley: [A yao xi dan pian···A yao ji dan pian···] The tone is long, loud and clear. When I heard this cry approaching, I would stick my head out of the upstairs window and shout, [Hey, please wait a moment!] Then the Jiangbei girl selling egg slices stopped there, looked up, and revealed a plump round face under a snow-white headscarf; two bright, smiling eyes flashed in front of me. I would send a small basket from the window with a rope, and the Jiangbei girl would take two copper coins from the basket and put two slices of egg slices in it. Gradually, I got used to it. Every day when I heard the clock on the table strike twice, I would think of that girl. As long as I heard her calling from afar as she walked into the alley, I would put down what I was playing with or eating and wait at the window for her; she didn't need me to greet her anymore. When she walked past my house downstairs, she would take two slices of egg slices, look up, and wait for me to lower the small basket. I would chew the egg slices while watching her carry the basket, lift her two thin little feet, and drag her long cry out of the alley.</p>
<p>In recent years, all the time has been spent in a foreign land, and that girl and the sweet and delicious egg slices have gradually been forgotten.</p>
<p>Last year, I went home for winter vacation. One afternoon, I was lazily lying in a chair reading a novel. The sun shone on me, making me a little tired; the big tabby cat lying on the threshold was also dozing off lazily. The wintersweet on the table was exuding a faint fragrance.</p>
<p>From afar came the cry for selling egg slices again, the tone was sad and hoarse. I seemed to recall something, and pushed open the window foolishly. The scissor-like north wind rushed towards my face. I plucked up the courage and stretched out my neck to look down. The head that was raised up upon hearing the sound of the window was still wrapped in a white headscarf, but under the headscarf was the face of a middle-aged woman who already had wrinkles and looked haggard and thin. Those two eyes emitted a melancholy light, as if she also recalled something, and looked at me foolishly for a while. Then she dragged her sad and weak cry and walked out of the alley. I still suspect that this haggard woman is the plump girl of a few years ago.</p>
<p>Similarly, this woman selling egg slices may also be suspecting that this dignified girl is the little girl with braids who used to lie at the window to buy egg slices every day a few years ago!</p>
<h3 id="e194">Anatole France and Antiques <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Qiyu</p>
<p>People often say that Anatole France and George Bernard Shaw can be called the two jewels of European literature, because both are good at [humor]. Among them, George Bernard Shaw's longevity is really good. At the age of seventy-seven, he can still be [old and not die], and he can still come to China to be humorous, and he can still be humorous about the [southward migration of antiques].</p>
<p>However, George Bernard Shaw's humor about the southward migration of antiques is nothing more than saying things like [antiques are more important than the lives of millions of people in Peiping] (see his remarks in Shen Bao). Chinese people have already said such words, so from the perspective of the humorist George Bernard Shaw, it does not seem to have much humorous meaning.</p>
<p>As for Anatole France, who spent his life in ancient books, antiques, ancient ..., unfortunately, he also [became ancient] a few years ago and could not come to China in person, so we have no way to hear his opinion on the southward migration of antiques. But he once wrote the following satire on the Arabs:</p>
<p>[The Arabs who use marble from the Palmyra temple to build a small house are more like philosophers than all the custodians of the museums in London, Paris, Munich, etc.]</p>
<p>Isn't this already Anatole France's indirect satire on the southward migration of antiques!</p>
<p>Imperialists often regard the Chinese as Arabs; since Arabs can use antiques to build small houses for themselves, why can't we use antiques? Instead of doing it secretly in Peiping, why not move it to the concession and use it happily?</p>
<p>In this way, amidst the opposition of the majority, antiques finally entered the concession a few days ago, and we became [very similar] to the Arabs.</p>

<p>— George Bernard Shaw, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>[I am not seeking happiness; I am seeking God,] said the black girl.</p>
<p>[Have you not found him yet?] said the magician.</p>
<p>[I have found many gods,] said the black girl. [Everyone I have come to has introduced one to me; even this image maker has a shop full of gods. But in my eyes, they are all half-dead, except for a few beast-shaped ones, like the half-goat, half-man one on the first shelf blowing a flute. That one is very natural-looking; because although I also want to be a goddess, I myself am half-goat, half-woman. Why are none of them half-woman?]</p>
<p>[What about pursuing this one?] said the image maker, pointing to Venus.</p>
<p>[Why are good bodies covered in clothes?] said the black girl. [She is neither a goddess nor a woman; half of her body is shy, and the other half is what white people call a lady. She looks like a lady, and she is beautiful, and the white governor would like her to be the head of his house; but I think she has no conscience; that makes her inhuman and ungodly. I don't need her.]</p>
<p>[The Way (Note) must be made with flesh and blood; white stone will not do,] said the guard. [You must not be disgusted because these gods have human bodies. If they did not bring out human forms for you, then how could you have anything in common with them? To have a link between divinity and humanity, some gods must become human.]</p>
<p>(Note) [The Way is God] (See the Gospel of John)</p>
<p>[Some women may as well become gods,] said the black girl. [That would be much better, because a god who descends to become a man is demeaning himself; a woman who becomes a god raises herself.]</p>
<p>[God is the refuge of all bothersome women,] (Note) said the Arab. [This is the most bothersome woman I have ever met. Making women beautiful and also bothersome is one of God's mysterious methods. The more satisfying reason he gives them, the more dissatisfied they become; this person is dissatisfied even with the very dignified and powerful God himself. Oh, young lady, if the glorious and great God cannot please you, what god or goddess can please you?]</p>
<p>(Note) See the Old Testament</p>
<p>[There is a goddess I have heard of that I want to know more about,] said the black girl. [Her name is called Maat; I feel she has something here that no other god can give us.]</p>

In 1927, China severed diplomatic relations with the old Russian Empire, and this year, it resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Russian Federation. I was responsible for most of this. China and Russia have close relations in geography, history, and politics. The territories of the two countries are adjacent to each other for thousands of miles, and the signing of the Beijing Agreement in 1924 is the basis for mutual assistance and mutual benefit between the two countries. China is very pleased with the implementation and success of the Soviet Russian economic plan, because the Chinese government is also facing the same arduous task in the future construction of a new China." Soviet Chairman Kalinin responded by saying: "The Soviet Union's friendship with China is based on the principles of the declarations of 1919 and 1920. Today, I am very pleased that Ambassador Yan has been honored with his important mission and has come to Russia from afar. I sincerely hope that Ambassador Yan will make positive efforts in promoting the friendship between China and Russia in the future." (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japan's Ambitions Towards Us Have Not Ceased</p>
<p>Strengthening China's Determination to Resist Japan</p>
<p>(London) Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations and Minister to the United Kingdom, returned here yesterday from Geneva. This afternoon, a reporter from this agency visited him. Minister Guo said: "There is no such thing as direct negotiations between China and Japan, because they are contrary to the policy China holds, and Japan has now occupied Rehe and its ambitions have not ceased. Its intention is to conquer all of China and dominate Asia. Therefore, direct negotiations at this time are also useless. Chinese public opinion is extremely angry. Although Rehe has been lost, it must be restored. This can be predicted. Although there is no official news to confirm the death of Tang Yulin and the resignation of Zhang Xueliang, the military resistance against Japan will definitely be personally directed by Chiang Kai-shek from now on, and the people of the whole country will support him with one heart and one mind. Although Guangzhou and Nanjing had slightly different opinions on politics in the past, they have now abandoned their past grievances and are united against foreign enemies. The only thing they do not agree on is the method of national defense that should be adopted. Therefore, China is becoming unified first due to the pressure of foreign aggression. I personally am deeply disappointed with the defeat of the Chinese army, but although the war is temporarily unfavorable, the morale of the people is still available. From now on, the national self-defense psychology of the people of the whole country will be even greater than before. Therefore, the loss of Rehe has strengthened China's determination to resist to the end. The League of Nations report is obviously critical of Japan's actions. However, the Japanese government advanced into Rehe Province after the report was passed by the Extraordinary General Assembly, and staged another act of aggression. In such a situation, it is more necessary than before for the international community to exert diplomatic and economic pressure on Japan, and our people have even more right to boycott enemy goods so that they will not be dumped on our market." As Minister Guo was about to finish speaking, he mentioned that the issue of banning arms exports will be discussed in Geneva, saying, "I sincerely hope for the success of the Disarmament Conference, but I personally believe that this conference has little hope. As long as Japan does not withdraw from Chinese territory, China will not sign the Disarmament Convention for a single day. The Tokyo government will also refuse to sign it. In such a situation, how can the naval reduction demanded by the great powers be achieved? I fear that the Disarmament Conference will be shelved from now on." A certain British radio company will ask Guo Taiqi and Yosuke Matsuoka to speak on the Sino-Japanese dispute on Saturday. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e225">U.S. Special Congress Passes Roosevelt's Emergency Bill <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Granting the President Broad Powers to Deal with the Gold Crisis</p>
<p>Approving the Expansion of Currency to Assist Bank Recovery</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th - Both houses of Congress today passed the banking bill submitted by President Roosevelt to Congress a few hours ago, granting him the power to expand U.S. currency and continue his emergency powers to deal with banking and financial matters. The bill stipulates that national cash be concentrated in the Federal Reserve Bank and authorizes bankers to circulate Federal Reserve Bank notes to pay for U.S. government bonds, bills, drafts, and bank receipts. Such notes are issued to banks at the full value of U.S. government bonds and ninety percent of the value of all genuine bills, circulate throughout the country, are fully accepted, and can be exchanged for legal tender. The bill allows sound banks to resume operations immediately, while unsound banks must be reorganized. The bill authorizes the President, during a national emergency declared by him, to send personnel to investigate, regulate, or prohibit, in accordance with the regulations he promulgates, foreign exchange and other businesses operated by banks in the United States, as well as the export, hoarding, melting, or allocation of gold and silver coins or gold and silver bars or currency by people within the United States. Anyone who violates the provisions of this bill may be sentenced to ten years in prison and/or a fine of 10,000 yuan. The bill stipulates that the Minister of Finance may order individuals or groups or organizations to hand over all gold coins, gold bars, and gold vouchers they own to the U.S. Treasury and exchange them for any coins or currency cast or issued in accordance with U.S. law. The amount of U.S. bonds owned by all U.S. banks is currently not accurately statistically available, but according to private statistics on Wall Street, it should reach 10,000,000,000 yuan as of March 1. The amount of bank drafts and other notes that can be used as currency basis is currently impossible to determine. It is estimated that the amount currently circulating in the market is 7,250,000,000 yuan. The currency flowing in the United States in February increased by 906,000,000 yuan, totaling 6,546,000,000 yuan. The circulation of gold coins has increased from 478,837,000 yuan to 571,338,000 yuan. The nationwide per capita circulation has jumped from 45.06 yuan to 52.23 yuan. This is the highest per capita circulation since the end of October 1920, and the total circulation has reached the highest level on record.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th - President Roosevelt today proposed in his address to Congress to immediately begin the operation of sound banks and proposed methods for expanding currency during the bank reorganization period. The President will ask Congress to pass two other extremely important plans as soon as possible. It is said that the extremely important plans he refers to include authorizing the President to actively reduce central government expenses (including veterans' benefits) and to organize large-scale public buildings to settle the unemployed. President Roosevelt's message to Congress reads: "I believe that this banking legislation can not only immediately dispel the public's improper doubts about sound banks, but also represent the starting point of a new relationship between American banks and the people. In order to achieve the first goal, that is, the resumption of banking, I ask Congress to immediately pass legislation authorizing the government to manage banks in order to protect depositors, and to authorize the banks that are found to be sound to resume operations as soon as possible, and to reorganize the banks that are deemed necessary to reorganize and reopen them. I request that the Federal Reserve Act be amended to provide for the issuance of appropriately increased currency with sufficient collateral to meet currency needs, without increasing the unsecured debt of the U.S. government. There is no need to say that the current situation requires immediate action. It would be unthinkable if banking convenience were to stop for a long time. If this bill is passed, this situation can be eliminated. I believe that business activities can definitely be restored in a short period of time. The new members of Congress must know the great responsibility that I and the members bear. Even in a short period of five days, it is impossible to determine a complete plan that can save the day, but this should not be a reason to delay the implementation of this first step." President Roosevelt did not say that with this action, we can proceed with the consideration of a national recovery plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th - After the banking bill was passed by both houses of Congress, President Roosevelt immediately signed it into law. Reuters, Washington, 9th - When the Treasury Department was inquired today about how foreign banks' deposits in sound banks in New York would be handled in accordance with the new banking bill, it was answered that it is not yet possible to determine whether or under what conditions the funds can be paid out. It will be possible to speak only after a thorough study of the new bill.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th - With President Roosevelt's swift action, sound banks are able to reopen, and bankers and people in Wall Street are all rejoicing today. Major banks in New York are now preparing to immediately resume all normal activities. It is said that the credibility of the U.S. dollar abroad has gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th - The New York Rubber Exchange, the New York Leather Exchange, the National Metal Exchange, and the National Raw Silk Exchange will merge into a commodities exchange, effective May 1. When members discussed this proposal today, almost all of them approved it. Not a single member of the Rubber, Leather, and Metal Exchanges voted against it, but 15 of the 219 members of the Raw Silk Exchange voted against it. Now, because it is necessary to wait for the authorities to approve the new plan before engaging in finding the address of the new market, each exchange will temporarily continue to trade in the existing market. However, the committee is currently considering the advantages and disadvantages of the buildings of each exchange and will determine a suitable location in the near future. The new commodities exchange will be limited to 1,015 members, and each member will pay a membership fee of 900 yuan, so that the agency will have more than 900,000 yuan of operating capital. There are various benefits after the merger, which will save expenses, employees can be reduced, the pricing machine can be changed to use one, and each person's telephone fees can also be reduced. The new market will trade in six types of goods: rubber, leather, raw silk, silver, bronze, and tin. The latter three will still follow the current method, gathering in one place. This matter has been negotiated for two and a half years, and it has only been completed now.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 9th - The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the governor today announced that the bank holiday has been extended to Saturday morning. It is said that the states of Georgia, Washington, New Jersey, and Oregon have all extended the national bank holiday to Saturday and Sunday, and the state bank to Monday.</p>

<p>Signs of the Disintegration of the Federal System</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Reuters) - Hitler's bloodless victory in Bavaria is seen here in responsible circles as a sign of the disintegration of the German federal system. It is now expected that the central government aims to build a unified Germany, establishing a parliament in Berlin and a supreme governing body, namely the central government. The acceptance of General von Epp by the Bavarian government as an administrative commissioner was a painful decision to avoid bloodshed. This is because the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers were all armed with pistols, and if the Bavarian government had refused, they would have used force to seize all public offices. Currently, all public offices, including the parliament, are guarded by armed detachments of the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers.</p>

<p>Difficulties in Reconciling French and German Opinions</p>
<p>British and French Behind-the-Scenes Contacts Draw Criticism from Germans</p>
<p>Geneva, 9th (Reuters) - When British Prime Minister MacDonald arrives here in the coming days, he will find that France and Germany hold completely conflicting views on any issue in the disarmament matter. It will be extremely difficult to find a common ground for an agreement. What is most troubling is not only the absence of the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, but also the absence of any senior German officials. The Germans have been very critical of Prime Minister MacDonald's 36-hour stopover in Paris on his way to Geneva. Today, when the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, opened the debate at the General Committee of the Conference, he asked all countries to unanimously express goodwill towards this important matter.</p>
<p>Paris, 9th (Havas) - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon departed from London at 11 AM this morning and arrived in Paris at 5:40 PM this afternoon. French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Boncour personally welcomed them at the station. They then accompanied Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Simon to the British Embassy for an hour-long meeting. Daladier is scheduled to meet with MacDonald and Simon at the State Council at 10 AM tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Strength and Defense Areas of Various Sichuan Armies <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Before the War, the Total Number of Troops Was About 400,000</p>
<p>After the War, it Actually Increased to Over 440,000</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The number of troops in Sichuan, before the major war between the two Lius, was said to be 400,000, but in reality, it was only about 370,000 to 380,000. At that time, the various armies were facing a breakdown due to the excessive number of troops and the inability to maintain their salaries. Thus, war was brewing, aiming to resolve the financial difficulties of the military through war. It was not until the issuance of the telegram by 94 generals, that the 479th war was prompted. After the signing of the ceasefire agreement, not only were none of the sixteen principles for governing Sichuan mentioned in the telegram of the 94 generals implemented, but the various warlords intensified their efforts, increased the burden on the people, and greatly expanded their troops. It is estimated that the 70,000 to 80,000 soldiers who were eliminated on the battlefield have been completely replenished, and an additional 70,000 to 80,000 soldiers have been added. The recent number of troops in Sichuan has exceeded the pre-war level, with approximately 440,000 to 450,000 soldiers. The investigation of the strength and defense areas of each army is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e236">National Defense Can Only Be Consolidated When the National Crisis is Relieved <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Self-Abandonment, the Disaster of Chengde, Will Spread Throughout the Country</p>
<p>The Country Relies on Air Defense; the Lessons of the Three Northeastern Provinces and Rehe Are Not Far Behind</p>
<p>The Public Should Voluntarily Organize, and Every Penny Should Be Used</p>
<p>Since the fall of Chengde, some people have become disillusioned with national affairs and expressed despair, while others doubt that the aviation-based national salvation movement is too slow to be of any help in the national crisis. This morning, the China Aviation Association issued a special declaration, stating the importance of air defense and urging the people to learn from the fall of Rehe and work harder. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Aviation Association's Letter to the People <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of this association, all parties have expressed their expectations and the whole country has provided assistance. Although the solicitation of members has not lasted more than ten days, the results are remarkable, and we are deeply gratified. However, with the fall of Chengde and the danger to North China, a few passionate individuals suddenly witnessed the light commission of national territory by one or two cowardly divisional escapees, which embarrassed the international community, and then rushed into the abyss of despair, thinking that the national affairs are like this, can I alone remain pure to the end? Alas, filling the mind with a psychology of self-abandonment is enough to erode the national fabric and more than enough to do so. Do we mean that our patriotic people are willing to perish from this point onward? How did Rehe fall? It is said that it was due to the cowardice of the commanding general, the complete lack of preparation, the inconvenience of transportation, and the obstruction of communication. This argument is correct, but if we think about it calmly, we will know that the military strength of the enemy and us is too far apart. We only rely on the ancient organization, while the enemy is rich in modern weapons. We only rely on the bravery of the army, while the enemy uses the power of the air force to control the fate of our army. Other things aside, those who gallop and gallop over mountains and ridges to detect military situations, destroy our positions, slaughter our compatriots, and demoralize our morale are the enemy planes ravaging them, which is enough to make our loyal and brave soldiers run around in vain and end up with regret? Alas, if our people learn from the fall of Chengde and from now on, they will be indifferent as if they have lost something, and no longer enthusiastically contribute to the flourishing of our aviation national defense, then the disaster of Chengde will follow and spread throughout the country. Thinking about this, how can we not shudder? It is not just about dealing with the national crisis at the moment. We live in this world, and since we cannot live without a country, the country cannot be without defense, and air defense is the newest and most effective weapon of national defense and the most effective means of self-defense. We cannot live without a country for a day, so we cannot live without air defense for a day. The lack of organization in air defense in the past has caused us to lose three provinces and trap Rehe. If, even today, we are still a nation that has long been without aerial resistance, can we ask whether our people's lives and our national fabric can be permanently secure from this point onward? This is a serious question that we hope our compatriots across the country will think about deeply and carefully. This association was organized to witness the special pain of the Songhu Incident and to urgently save the country, and now the solicitation of members coincides with the autumn when the area outside Guan fell into the hands of the enemy and Chengde was announced to have fallen. Recalling the national crisis, we feel even more inspired. Now the whole country is filled with grief and indignation, and the army has done its best to fight. If we can unite as one and save the country through aviation, and everyone joins this association as a member, then the day when the foundation of aviation national defense is consolidated will also be the autumn when our unprecedented national crisis is suddenly relieved. Time waits for no one, let us rise together. Finally, this association has something that cannot be left unsaid. This association is an organization voluntarily organized by the people. Although the government appreciates its aspirations and hires directors to supervise it, the association's affairs are conducted on the basis of the association's autonomy, and the membership fees collected are based on the association's receipts. After collection, the association's management committee is responsible for safekeeping, and the management committee is composed of the association's directors and celebrities from all walks of life. In the future, how this association will use the funds, how to develop its事业, and how to contribute to the government, will all be decided by this association based on the public's opinion. The government has no intention of helping to plan and all the funds will be used for public benefit. People from all walks of life are kindly requested to take note of this.</p>

The notice stated that, according to the government's order, the use of customs silver taels will be abolished from March 10 of this year, and the newly minted silver currency will be used instead. The fineness of this silver currency is 88, containing 23.493448 grams of pure silver. The conversion rate for customs silver taels is set at 7 mace, 1 candareen, and 9 cash. Therefore, 100 customs silver taels are equivalent to 155.80 yuan of the newly minted silver standard currency. From this date, all export taxes, transit taxes, surcharges, and various donations, which were previously collected in customs silver taels, will be calculated in this new currency. The value of local goods used for statistics, etc., should also be clearly stated in the newly minted silver standard currency. Before this new silver currency is widely circulated, the currently circulating silver dollars of other types, such as the Sun Yat-sen silver dollar, which are of equal value, will continue to be accepted as substitutes for the newly minted silver standard currency. Other types of silver dollars will be accepted at the market price. However, import taxes and other taxes collected in gold units should continue to be handled as before. This order should be implemented immediately. All merchants are hereby notified.</p>

<p>Regularly Review Production and Sales Volumes</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens Association jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting attention to inferior goods passing off as domestic goods. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, according to the discussion at the members' congress of our association [on how to determine national salvation methods and implement them effectively], a majority of the attending members proposed that recently, some domestic goods manufacturers have been using the certificates of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and domestic goods organizations to secretly replace trademarks with inferior goods, especially printing and dyeing factories and cotton yarn merchants. Therefore, it was resolved that we should immediately send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and domestic goods organizations, requesting that they pay close attention to whether the production volume of domestic goods manufacturers matches the sales volume, and review them regularly." The matter concerns the fundamental plan for national salvation and should be approved. We are sending you the records and ask that you investigate and implement them.</p>

<h3 id="e245">The Plummeting of European and American Export Goods <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the hot war, North China has become tense, and transportation has mostly stopped. In addition, the recent intense financial turmoil has had a greater impact on export businesses. The investigation and report are as follows:</p>
<p>Within this week in Europe, the cargo volume of Shanghai's European liners has sharply declined. The Great British Mail Steamer, which usually has the most business, also only carried 220 bundles of Huzhou silk and 50 tons of Chinese tea on its latest voyage. This is only about 20% of its usual capacity. French mail steamers leaving port had no goods to carry at all, only oriental silk and cloth were shipped to Europe. The Italian mail steamer leaving port only carried a few samples. According to shipping industry insiders, the market has been stagnant since the hot war, and nobody is shipping goods. This level of decline is rarely seen.</p>
<p>There are too many Sino-American liners and an overabundance of tonnage on the American route. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company's ships have carried no more than 100 tons of cargo each time in the past ten days. The export cargo of the Japan Mail Company (NYK) is even less. For example, the over 20,000-ton Ryuyo Maru to America only carried 30 or 40 tons of cargo. Other ships such as the Standatol and Shelver are only loaded with incoming goods and have no outgoing cargo. The Sino-American New Company's ships have a small amount of freight because they are not part of the conference.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Germany to Change National Flag <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>German Residents in this City Prefer the Old National Flag</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports: Will Germany adopt the black, red, and gold tricolor flag as its national flag, or will it change back to the old black, white, and red tricolor flag? This is a question that Germany will solve. German residents in this city are calmly awaiting the decision. According to German telegrams, the National Socialist Party has already lowered the black, red, and gold republican flag and raised the old black, white, and red flag, with the National Socialist Party swastika emblem in the center. However, Shanghai has not yet changed it. When the German Consulate General in Shanghai was asked about this matter yesterday, they replied that the black, red, and gold tricolor flag is stipulated in the constitution of the German Republic. If the new parliament resolves to amend the clause on the national flag in the constitution, or if the president issues a special order to change the national flag, Shanghai will immediately change it. As for the feelings of the German residents in this city regarding the change to the old flag, a respected figure told a "North China Daily News" representative that the German residents in this city have always been dissatisfied with the replacement of the black, white, and red national flag with the black, red, and gold tricolor, but as law-abiding citizens, they have no choice but to comply. He also said that Germans feel a certain significance in being under the black, white, and red tricolor flag, because Germany was a world power when this flag was used, so everyone respected it. Although it is uncertain whether Germany will be able to regain its status as a major power in the future, the restoration of the flag of its former glorious era is welcomed by the Germans in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Chinese general manager of the British Tram Company, Wang Afu, staff member Zhang Shaoshan, and Western staff member Bullock, etc., received as many as four threatening letters from gangsters from January 14th to 15th of this year, intending to extort 100,000 yuan. Wang et al. reported to the police station, and after investigation, it was learned that this was done by Wang Jiasheng (also known as Wang Kai, also known as Xiao Tianbao Wang Kaishan), a Cantonese man. The Chinese detectives of the Old Zhabei Police Station, Huang Yingjie, Bao Tan Wang Yifei, and Weng Hongxun, etc., arrested Wang on Jingzhou Road yesterday and sent him to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Local Court this morning. The police lawyer Ru Bao was immediately appointed, stating that the police station is now prosecuting in accordance with Article 370, Section 3 of the Criminal Law and Article 2 of the Law on the Punishment of Bandits. However, the circumstances of this case are quite complicated, and the investigation will take a long time. For the convenience of the investigation, it is requested that the court allow a postponement. However, the defendant's conduct is quite improper. He was previously sentenced to five years in prison for a theft case and then committed a fraud case, for which he was sentenced to three months in prison by your court. He was just released from prison on January 11th of this year, and on the 14th he again wrote to the plaintiff to extort him, which shows that he generally has no respect for the law. He then submitted the defendant's fingerprint sheet to the case. Ma Shide, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, verified the report, briefly questioned the defendant, and ordered Wang to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>

Dai and his two friends suffered forehead injuries, and the driver's nose was injured and bleeding. All four were discharged from the hospital after treatment. However, the bodyguard sitting next to the driver had a fractured jaw and remained in the hospital for treatment. According to the driver, he heard his master talking to him, so he looked back to listen and did not know that the light pole was in front of him, resulting in the accident.</p>

<p>— Geng</p>
<p>For eighteen long months, the national crisis has yet to come to an end. On one hand, our country has to grit its teeth and endure the various wounds that the violent Japan constantly inflicts upon us, and on the other hand, we have to put on a forced smile and wait quietly for the League of Nations to make a decision. At this time of hardship and devastation, any ray of hope is enough to bring some comfort. This is especially true when multiple small countries can speak out for justice at each League of Nations meeting. Unexpectedly, recent events have brought a flood of bad news. Siam, our small neighbor, has suddenly become known for its [flattery of Japan] and [anti-Chinese sentiment].</p>
<p>Siam and China are both small and weak Asian countries. Due to the long history and close geographical relationship, there are more than two million Chinese and mixed-race people in Siam's population of over nine million, and its royal family is also of Chinese descent. Therefore, their international relations should be interdependent and mutually supportive. However, Siam, for some unknown reason, is taking advantage of our crisis to vigorously stir up trouble for us, acting like a [dog kicking a rabbit downhill]. First, it abstained from voting on the League of Nations report, which clearly fueled the flames of the violent Japan. Then, it purchased large quantities of military supplies from Europe and resold them to Japan. Most recently, it promulgated a law requiring primary schools to teach Siamese for at least 25 hours per week, clearly aiming to restrict the Chinese schools run by our overseas Chinese from having time to teach Chinese. Why is Siam willing to act as a pawn for the violent Japan and act like a tiger?</p>
<p>According to Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, [Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Article 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations]. The violent Japan is a country that violates the Covenant of the League of Nations, and Siam is a member state that has the [obligation to sever relations with countries that violate the Covenant]. However, not only does it not sever relations with the violent Japan, but it also goes against its conscience and engages in [flattering Japan] and [anti-Chinese] activities. Is this not going against the tide to the extreme?</p>
<p>Moreover, even Western powers are deeply uneasy about Japan's continental policy of [To conquer the world, first conquer China]. Siam, a small country in the near east, does not seem to realize the vital importance of [The strength of your neighbor is the weakness of yours], [If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold], and to recognize early on who will be my strong enemy and who will be my best friend. Is this not greatly perplexing?</p>
<p>As for yesterday's report denying Siam's sale of military supplies, it further demonstrates the Siamese people's deliberately ambiguous attitude to confuse the world. Those who bear the great responsibility of diplomatic negotiation must pay close attention to this!</p>

<p>— Gu Zuliang</p>
<p>A futile effort to act as a bulwark is like lukewarm water; When enemy soldiers invade, they panic in disarray. What comes of losing soldiers and land? Abandoning our border is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The fall of Liaoning and Jilin was already lamentable; The loss of Rehe is even more alarming and disconcerting. The shrinking territory still fails to awaken them; When will they rise up and recover the lost lands?</p>
<p>Everywhere, the call to save the nation is heard; So much passionate fervor is displayed by the people. But what use is resistance based solely on words? Without a fight, Chengde City is abandoned once more.</p>
<p>Cars hastily carry away personal belongings; As the enemy approaches, they quickly flee. With such soldiers and such courage, When will the shrinking of the borders ever end?</p>

<h3 id="e258">Aerial Surveying <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Jin</p>
<p>The development of modern science has truly been advancing at a rapid pace. Furthermore, in order to increase the effectiveness of lethal weapons, many astonishing new techniques have been discovered in the implementation of military science. The recent aerial surveying is one of these thousands of techniques.</p>
<p>The trajectory of a shell fired into the air is an arc-shaped parabola. The distances calculated on the most detailed military maps using a scale are horizontal distances. This is something that anyone with basic knowledge knows. However, the ground is never completely flat. The elevation differences between locations A and B can never be said to be completely on the same horizontal line. Therefore, many artillerymen, despite having extremely precise machinery and subtle calculations, still fail to hit their targets with their bullets. For this reason, the need for aerial surveying has arisen spontaneously.</p>
<p>The personnel required for aerial surveying are not ordinary land surveyors. What is needed are aviation personnel who can also take photographs. The method of surveying is extremely simple. It only requires using a specially made camera (like those used for filming movies) to continuously photograph the ground from a height of about two hundred feet.</p>
<p>After the photography is completed, the negatives are developed and printed like photographs. Because only one side of each negative is usable and clear, to have a completely usable topographic map, considerable editing is required. Once everything is ready, it can be printed on a flat sheet of blueprint paper.</p>
<p>The elevation in the photograph can be determined by the depth of the color. The topographic photograph that has been taken can be used by the draftsman to draw many perspective lines from it, and from this, the accurate elevation of the terrain can be calculated. By understanding the horizontal and vertical distances between the two locations, it is not difficult for the soldiers firing the artillery to calculate the exact distance at which they should fire the bullet. This allows every shot to hit its target, with no wasted shots. This is truly an astonishing event.</p>
<p>It is said that the Japanese military aircraft that appeared daily over the Rehe border several weeks ago without firing any bullets were their survey aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Half a Dozen Unexpected Things <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The country with the largest army in the world was unexpectedly invaded by troops from a small country of three islands, who rampaged through the territory without any effective resistance. This is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Having tens of thousands of soldiers defending key passes, while 128 enemy soldiers effortlessly occupy Chengde, is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Despite declarations of resisting to the last soldier and the last gun, they fled with a brigade and a regiment while still far from the enemy. This is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Holding a doctrine of non-resistance, handing over the three northeastern provinces, and then expressing great rage and demanding strict punishment upon hearing that subordinates fled without a fight, is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Three thousand rickshaws, pulled by soldiers to transport supplies to the battlefield, happened to arrive at Gubeikou when Chengde fell, and refugees from outside the pass fled into the pass, competing to hire vehicles, resulting in a threefold increase in market profits. This is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>The dignified head of the Executive Yuan personally went north to inspect and knew that Rehe could only be defended for one week to ten days. At the time, he did not think of remedies but made flippant remarks afterward. This is truly unexpected.</p>

<p>In front of a large building off a busy street, suddenly came four middle school students in the same color uniforms, wearing school badges. Two of them were holding white bamboo cloth flags, one was carrying a large bundle of flyers, and one was carrying a black leather bag. Their faces all had solemn and heroic expressions, and their steps were neat and clear.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they stopped in front of the building and went up a few stone steps, looking into the gatehouse. A middle-aged man in a coarse cloth shirt came out. They did not wait for him to ask and explained that they wanted to see the owner here. After hearing this, the middle-aged man frowned, but seeing that they were all civilized people, he reluctantly led them in. After passing through several winding doors, they sat down in a magnificent reception room. They thought: [With such a grand setting, today's donation will be at least one hundred or fifty at the lowest.] So they all held their breath and listened quietly as the man in the coarse cloth shirt announced:</p>
<p>[Master: There are several students from洋 school (modern style school) here asking to see you.]</p>
<p>[Damn it, is your rice bowl full? Always bringing these little devils to make fun of me. Get out! Humph....]</p>
<p>[Um, um! Master, take a deep breath and smoke a pipe.]</p>
<p>It seemed that something had been stuffed into the master's mouth, and there was a real silence for a while, with only the opium smoke permeating the inner room.</p>
<p>[Mr. Wang: You really don't know my troubles these past few days. The little devils keep talking about the national crisis. Do you think I have the heart for that? My eldest son has lung disease and is lying in the hospital, and my youngest son has contracted the spring epidemic and needs to see a doctor. Your mistress also has a relapse of her old illness, and my daughter is getting married next month, and she is making a fuss about getting a dowry every day. National crisis, national crisis, I can't even take care of my family's troubles! It's really hateful! Sigh!]</p>
<p>[Um, um! Master, take a deep breath again. Are you still standing there waiting to be scolded? Go quickly and reply to the little devils and don't bring them in here again in the future.]</p>
<p>[Yes, yes, thank you, Master Wang.] The man came out with a long face and glared at the students.</p>
<p>The four young people who were running for the country could not help but be filled with anger. They quickly left the reception room, but they could hear the conversation inside again.</p>
<p>[Wang Xingkuang: Think about it for me, how can my sons' illnesses be resolved? Alas!]</p>
<p>[Yes, yes, Master, I will definitely go to the Dabei Temple tomorrow and ask the head to send a few monks to perform the Star宿 ritual for the young masters. It's okay, Master: spend a few more repentance coins, and it will surely make the young masters lively and energetic again. Okay, Master, have another pipe.]</p>
<p>[Mr. Wang, you must be tired, have a pipe too!][Oh! Thank you, Master.]</p>
<p>Alas! A long sigh spread from the mouths of the four young people full of patriotism into the air.</p>

<p>— Geng</p>
<p>This was on a particularly fast second-class train in the morning.</p>
<p>[Sir, excuse me, can I borrow your lighter?] A middle-aged man with a well-trimmed mustache, his face full of smiles, came over to the young man who was gleaming, dressed in a Western suit, and leaning against the window smoking a cigar.</p>
<p>[The porter has lighters!] The young man quickly moved a new leather bag, which looked quite plump, on the tea table closer to the train wall, and even put a hand on it as if afraid it would fly away. Then, he exhaled two smoke rings, ignoring the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>In less than three minutes, a pretty Peace (brand cigarettes) modern girl, stylishly dressed, rushed over. Her ears and slender玉指 were decorated with glittering ornaments. Looking at an empty seat near a sitting armed comrade, she seemed ashamed to be with them, and in a flash, she shifted her gaze to the young man's face and gasped, [What bad luck, one step too late and there are no seats!]</p>
<p>[Uh!] The young man seemed to have been electrified. He only moved his臀部 and precisely gave up a seat.</p>
<p>[Thank you!] She smiled and sat down.</p>
<p>[You are welcome!]</p>
<p>[Sir, you are so kind. What is your honorable name? Where did you make your fortune?]</p>
<p>[My surname is Jin. I just returned from Belgium and am now doing a small job in the Budget Bureau of the National Government.]</p>
<p>[Oh, Mr. Jin is going to Nanjing. I am also going to Nanjing. However, I have never been to Nanjing. Near the Ministry of Education, I don't know if there are any beautiful hotels?]</p>
<p>[The Central Hotel is extremely beautiful! Perhaps the lady wants to be promoted in the Ministry of Education?]</p>
<p>[It's just a plan. If it doesn't succeed, I will have to ask you for a strong introduction!]</p>
<p>[How dare I!] Mr. Jin was overjoyed.</p>
<p>[Kunshan is here! Kunshan is here!] The porter shouted loudly; the train also stopped.</p>
<p>[The spring scenery is more beautiful than a painting, it's so lovely! Mr. Jin, would you like to take a look?] The lady leaned her head in from the train window, seeming to want to invite her companion to enjoy the beautiful scenery together. She only slightly tilted her head, but her left ear brushed against the train window, and she cried out [Ah! Mr.! What to do? My diamond earring fell off!]</p>
<p>Mr. Jin realized that the train was about to leave, so he quickly stretched out his head and looked down, and sure enough, he saw a golden shimmering earring shining beside the train tracks. So he volunteered to be quick on his feet, took big steps out of the train to pick up the earring for her. When he returned to his original seat, he exclaimed in surprise, [Ah! Did I get on the wrong train? Why can't I see the lady's beautiful figure and my leather bag containing 5,000 yuan in cash?]</p>
<p>Only the [Woo woo woo] sound of the train was heard, and the young man, who was holding the gold-plated and glass-like "precious" earring, his eyes dazed and fascinated, only saw the electric poles and the fields of ditches and furrows gradually moving, fleeting, and disappearing into the thick smoke and mist in the rear!</p>

<p>— Lao Shaozhou</p>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>A relative of mine, let's call him Jia, partnered with a friend in his hometown to open a money shop, with Jia acting as the manager. This year, the shop's shareholders underwent some changes. A new shareholder, Yi, couldn't appear publicly due to family reasons. Since Jia had no other shareholders he could rely on, he consulted me, asking me to make a public appearance on his behalf. Considering our family ties, I couldn't bear to see his endeavor, about to succeed, fail in an instant, so I readily agreed. All formal documents were to be signed and sealed by me publicly. However, Yi and I signed a separate private agreement, with Jia as a witness, using the shop's letterhead and Jia's personal seal. It stated that Yi alone would enjoy all profits and bear all losses of the shop in the future, without any involvement on my part. Looking back, I realize I was a bit hasty at the time. Now, I have some questions:</p>
<p>(1) Is this private agreement legally binding?</p>
<p>(2) If the shop fails and incurs losses exceeding its capital, and Yi is unable to bear the responsibility, will I be held liable?</p>
<p>Your wisdom is highly regarded, I hope you can provide an answer. (omitted below)</p>
<p>Respectfully, Lao Shaozhou</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This kind of acting as a front for someone else is very common in society, and many disputes arise from it. Here are the answers to Mr. Lao's two questions: The first is "of course it is effective." Although contracts are said to require formalities, sometimes even if the formalities are not complete, as long as they are sufficient to "express intent," they are considered valid in law. The answer to the second question is more complex. If the amount of the loss is within Yi's capacity to bear, then unless he is a minor or legally incapacitated, he cannot escape this responsibility. If the amount of the loss exceeds Yi's capacity, then you will be responsible. In short, the private agreement you and Yi signed is, of course, somewhat confidential and not public. Legal regulations stipulate that this type of contract is only effective between the parties involved and cannot be used against unknowing third parties. Therefore, in the unfortunate event that the loss exceeds the capital, Mr. Lao is primarily responsible, and Yi is only responsible to Mr. Lao.</p>

<p>— by Ep Falkowski, Abridged Translation by Zhixiang</p>
<p>[Doesn't the contract clearly state that we must cooperate with the mining factory? To enable the development of the entire mine and restore the old position of the anthracite industry in the market, we must fulfill all the provisions of the contract.]</p>
<p>[I would like to advise you: the executive committee absolutely cannot help actions that violate the contract. Or do you want to continue the strike! But, within the scope of our power, we will not help you. Such illegal actions cannot receive economic assistance. If you want to strike, then other misfortunes will befall you. You have work to do, food to eat, and you won't starve to death, you should be satisfied!]</p>
<p>He then said to the last speaker: [I know you, you are a Red radical! A special envoy from the Central Coal Miners Union, here to disrupt our American coal mines. I will seek the consent of the Executive Committee to deport such extremists. In my opinion, what he said tonight is the culmination of everything.]</p>
<p>The meeting place became even more tense and uneasy. [Hit him!] [Expel him!] Various voices rang out.</p>
<p>Stroebel used his monkey eyes to stare at the audience, trying to identify the criminals.</p>
<p>[I have a proposal,] someone shouted amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>[Order, brothers!] The chairman shouted into the noisy wave, [Someone has a proposal!]</p>
<p>[Starting tomorrow, we will go on strike until our working conditions improve.]</p>
<p>[Seconded!]</p>
<p>[This proposal is illegal,] the executive committee member's face changed color, clenching his fists and shouting.</p>
<p>[Call for a vote, call for a vote!] A shout swept in like a hurricane.</p>
<p>[All in favor, say [Aye]!] The chairman said into the clamor.</p>
<p>[Aye]. It erupted from the entire hall. The loud sound shook the photo of the founding union hanging on the wall, but his face showed an indifferent look.</p>
<p>[I don't care anymore,] Stroebel shouted loudly, then grabbed his hat and pipe and angrily walked out the door. [Wait! You'll see what victory you can get.] He said angrily as he left.</p>
<p>His escape caused the miners in the entire place to laugh sarcastically. Now they all left their seats and continued the meeting more fiercely. After Stroebel left, their unity became even stronger.</p>
<p>Standing in the back, Peter felt his blood flowing quickly, his blood vessels seemed about to burst.</p>
<p>Peter's tone also gradually swelled and shouted [Strike!]. He knew why! He deeply felt the pain and wounds accumulated over thousands of years! He also recalled the various situations he had experienced when he first entered the mine.</p>
<p>[Several of us will be expelled from the union.] Tim said.</p>
<p>[They will also expel the rest of us.]</p>
<p>[In this way, we must have a new organization to bravely attack the union that deceived us, and not be abused by those union officials who are afraid of losing their positions.]</p>
<p>Outside the meeting place, a line of light like red hair hung in the dark sky, and the cold wind blew the lamps on the street corners. The street was also calm at this time. The rich people in the city were leisurely indulging in sweet dreams. In such silence, only the sound of the coal mine's water pump kept coming. Peter, dressed in thin clothes, shivered. He wondered what his wife would think of this. Should he wake her up and tell her? No, it wouldn't be too late to tell her tomorrow, unless she was waiting for him to return… he used to wait for him to return, listening to the sound of the door…</p>
<p>Tomorrow, in this old mine, major changes will begin… Tomorrow, that evil place will begin to change…! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e265">Jeanne Crain After the Divorce <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongqin</p>
<p>After the news of Jeanne Crain's divorce from her husband was announced, newspapers in various countries published it in prominent positions. But what was the inside story of Jeanne Crain's divorce? What was Jeanne's intention in divorcing? There are many speculations from the outside world, and the rumors are divergent. Now, let's talk about the important points from the conversations published by her mother and her attorney, and we will have a conclusion.</p>
<p>Jeanne's attorney said; Jeanne entrusted him and Lee Dudelbeck to file for divorce a total of three times. The previous two times were conducted secretly, and the results were reconciliations. Therefore, very few outsiders knew about it. The reasons why Jeanne wanted a divorce were not very sufficient. The first time was because Jeanne was building a villa by the sea for summer vacations. She advocated building a delicate promenade on the beach, like a pier, while Lee Dudelbeck was vehemently opposed, advocating building a garden. The two quarreled because of this, and Jeanne used this as a reason for divorce. The second time was because Jeanne danced with a man at a banquet, and Lee Dudelbeck made a big scene with Jeanne because of this, almost resorting to violence. After these two incidents occurred, Jeanne went to Honolulu to live, and Lee Dudelbeck followed her both times to apologize to Jeanne. So she withdrew the lawsuit. The third time was this time, and there was no reason at all, just a disagreement between the two sides.</p>
<p>Jeanne's mother said; [There is nothing I disagree with my son-in-law about. He treats me like his own mother. Jeanne filed for divorce with him a total of three times, but in fact, there were five disagreements before and after. Every time they quarreled, Jeanne became ill because of it, and the reasons for the quarrels were not very sufficient. Once, they even quarreled about eating vegetables. I asked Jeanne carefully, but she couldn't tell me any reason.</p>
<p>Judging from the conversations of the two people, it can be seen that the marriage between Jeanne and Lee Dudelbeck was not entirely out of her own will, otherwise, without any sufficient reason, why would she have filed for divorce three times? Therefore, the saying that Jeanne married Lee Dudelbeck to spite Claire Farrell can be further confirmed. Now Farrell has resolutely resigned, indicating his farewell to Jeanne, but Jeanne has already fallen in love with Farrell and cannot stay with Lee Dudelbeck for the rest of her life. Now that Farrell is gone, Jeanne cannot recover, so she filed for divorce to show that she has not forgotten Farrell.</p>
<p>Jeanne's intention is like this, but what will Farrell do about it? According to reliable news, after Jeanne announced her divorce, the telephone at Claire Farrell's house rang non-stop. His friends all reported to him and inquired about how he would express himself. He received more than 20,000 letters in one week asking if he and Jeanne would reconcile. Although he stated that his relationship with his wife, Virginia, would not be affected by Jeanne, people in Hollywood do not believe that he is telling the truth. It is expected that the divorce between Farrell and Virginia is also a matter of time.</p>

<h3 id="e266">Review of A Bill of Divorcement <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Linghe</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen John Barrymore's performance, I think, will admire the depth of his acting. Although not every work is very successful, he will never disappoint us in any way. Just take this film as an example, compared to the role he played in Grand Hotel, it is a stunning success. Of course, this has a close relationship with the script, and the plot of [A Bill of Divorcement] can enable him to maximize his performance.</p>
<p>In order to make a more rigorous review of this play, it is necessary to briefly describe the story of this film.</p>
<p>During the First World War, how many happy families were separated because of it? There was a Hilary (played by John Barrymore), who was injured in his nerves due to the war and was admitted to a mental hospital for more than ten years. When he recovered and returned home, he fully expected to receive his wife's love and comfort. But he knew that his wife had already remarried because she did not want to live a widowed life, and the wedding date was imminent. At this time, Hilary's grief was naturally reasonable, and his wife was also trapped in the contradiction of love because of this. As a result, the madman Hilary realized the sincerity of his wife's love for her new husband, so he resolutely took his daughter and lived his miserable life. At that time, Hilary's daughter was also in love, but she knew that she must have a hereditary mental illness and was afraid of harming her children in the future, so she resolutely broke away from her lover and served her poor old father for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>In such a story, it can be said that there is no character in it that we can criticize. Although Hilary's actions are unbearable, they are also very reasonable for the sake of love and for her future. Of course, Hilary's daughter's resolute solitary life is also very admirable for her strength of reason. However, the most bitter thing is this mentally ill Hilary. If so, all the characters are so good, then it is indeed not easy to achieve success in the performance, because it is not easy to make the audience sympathize with all the people, but this is achieved in this film, so this is the success of this film.</p>
<p>The entire play is performed, of course, with Barrymore bearing the most strenuous role, therefore, the director of this film also specially focuses on Barrymore. But he also paid special attention to the madman's daughter (Katharine Hepburn). He is unremitting in the progress of the entire painting. They are used simply and powerfully. Especially for the inner performance of each character, he fully gives the actors the opportunity to play. Especially in the last scene, he completely entrusted the important and difficult plot to the tone of Peana, so that the audience received his powerful stimulation. This point makes us have to admire the strength of his methods. At the beginning, in order to introduce the plot, it has a stage play tone, which is always somewhat unexciting.</p>
<p>The use of lighting makes this play even more colorful, which makes us believe that a soft light is very suitable for tragedy, but if it can also be dim and clear (such as the light in [A Farewell to Arms]), it should be more beautiful and increase the power of this play. There is a lot of dialogue, but it is all necessary, the sound recording has reached a perfect state, and the scenery is also very suitable.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the skills of the actors, in addition to John's profound and detailed performance as mentioned above, the newcomer actress who plays the daughter is also very worthy of our attention. Her face and movements are similar to Greta Garbo, perhaps because she is trying her best to imitate Garbo. The rest of the people are not brilliant, but they do not destroy the plot.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Review of City Nights <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Pingying</p>
<p>In this city of magnificent buildings and brilliant lights, all that meets the eye are wine, meat, cars… things like enjoyment. However, although the appearance is like this, the underground is buried with tens of thousands of people who have been exploited by the rich until their flesh and blood are exhausted, and they still have to work hard all day and all night, selling their physical strength. Lianhua Company's [City Nights] is aimed at depicting the evils of the city, exposing the dark curtain of the city, and instructing promising young people not to be anesthetized by the nature of the city of drunken gold and paper fans. What a meaningful film this is!</p>
<p>The screenwriter's skills are superb, which really makes us praise him. He never relaxes in revealing the disparity between classes and the contrast between rich and poor, especially when the female worker sees that her father's illness is critical, she is fired from the factory, and there is almost no money or rice at home, she makes the greatest determination to endure the pain and do what she disdains to do 丨丨 to throw her own body into the world of demons. And her father's indignation and determination after discovering her behavior. This truly demonstrates the consciousness and identity of a true worker.</p>
<p>The director's skills are also really good, he can command the actors as he pleases in the plot.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Jin Yan and the child star Li Keng are just right. Ruan Lingyu is the most successful one in this film. Her movements and expressions make it impossible to find a single flaw from beginning to end. The rest of Wang Guilin and Li Junpan are also okay. Liu Jiqun plays the little celebrity in the film, and his identity is very suitable. Although the supporting roles of Zhang Meimei and Tang Tianyu are not very natural, they cannot reduce the color of this film.</p>
<p>The camera is still flexible, and the scenery is not bad, but it is redundant to explain in the subtitles which volume is finished, and it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>All in all; this film can be called a masterpiece among domestic products.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Talking about [City Nights] <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Hong</p>
<p>After watching [City Nights], which exposes the sins of special classes and calls for the oppressed masses, we deeply feel that Lianhua Film Company has achieved great success.</p>
<p>The sincerity of this film has grasped the current era in China, depicting the enjoyment of the rich and the suffering of the proletariat, which is truly incisive. Of course, this [City Nights] is also a film that the public needs and is also a contribution that closely follows the times?</p>
<p>We extremely admire the director's intelligence in the interweaving of the film. He contrasts the families of the wealthy with the families of the coolies, so that the audience can understand the happiness and suffering of the wealthy and the coolies. [So many people are homeless, what home am I going back to!] can be said to be the most powerful words in the whole film. The comparison between the cats of the rich and the cats of the coolies has great significance, making the audience's emotions more tense. When Ruan Lingyu played the old father who had to sell his body because of illness, it really made the audience's heartstrings tense and shocked with the heart of the people in the play.</p>
<p>When it comes to actors, Ruan Lingyu is the most successful. In the scenes of looking for her old father in the torrential rain, she shed tears, which made people… made the audience shed a few tears of sympathy. Jin…'s performance did not show his genius, but his suave and unrestrained appearance… quite helped the development of the plot.</p>
<p>The director's credit accounts for half of the success of [City Nights]. In addition to the interweaving that makes the audience admire, he also has high opinions on the actors' matching and pairing.</p>

<p>— Luofen</p>
<p>When Joan Crawford traveled to Europe with Little Van Banks last year, she met a doctor who determined that Joan Crawford was suffering from chronic inflammation of the central nervous system and would have a risk of cerebral congestion. He advised Joan Crawford to take a temporary rest and not work on the screen. Crawford smiled and ignored it. … After returning to the United States, she still lived on the screen. Now Joan Crawford suddenly suffered from headaches. Little Van Banks did not forget what happened last year and immediately hired a famous doctor to diagnose her. It is said that Joan's nerves have reached a dangerous state due to excessive thinking. If she continues to appear on the screen, she will definitely die after a year. Little Van Banks heard this terrible diagnosis and planned to order Joan Crawford to resign. Joan still planned to finish filming the new film [Turnabout] before deciding. Little Van Banks has been… very worried and is still trying to persuade her,</p>

<p>— Time</p>
<p>She wanted to warn the queen, but this queen mother was too superstitious about Rasputin and was too deeply poisoned. She would never listen to her warning. And Paul was no longer by the emperor's side to help her. Her distrust of him had forced him away alive.</p>
<p>One night, Rasputin went to the palace, … entered her boudoir, wanting to … comfort her, wanting to indulge in her arms, Nita … angrily resisted his insult, and her … small delicate body was there his opponent. Rasputin laughed and pushed her down. When she was unable to do anything, his eyes stared deeply at her.</p>
<p>[Sleep, my little baby,] he ordered.</p>
<p>So, as obedient as the little prince, as submissive as the other noble ladies, Nitaga was also subdued by him. She immediately fell into a deep sleep. Rasputin smiled and looked at her.</p>
<p>His … fire suddenly went out. He didn't want her because she had resisted him like this. There were more valuable prizes to be had. The emperor's eldest daughter, … Lina, had grown up, and she was sleeping in the next room.</p>
<p>He eagerly walked into the door. He inadvertently … knocked a candlestick … to the ground. There was a sudden … rapid sound of footsteps outside. He waited furtively. When the door opened, the queen was standing there.</p>
<p>[Father, you scared me to death!] she gasped. After a while, she said: [Why is this candlestick on the ground?]</p>
<p>Rasputin smiled cunningly and said: [In our Siberia, on St. John's Night, we burn fires in the woods, and people jump over the fires… to make our blessings rise to the sky in the fire. I was just demonstrating it to Nitaga.]</p>
<p>The queen seemed lost in thought. She suddenly … looked at the room over there. [But Nitaga is already asleep… You… What are you doing in the … Lina's room?] She didn't wait for a reply and hurried to Nitaga's room. [What's wrong with her… Is she sick?] she … shouted. [Her eyes are open….]</p>
<p>[I was just talking to her,] Rasputin defended. [She was very tired. So I put her to sleep.]</p>
<p>The girl was awakened by them, and with a slight groan, she struggled to break free from the shackles that bound her. The queen ran over and hugged her in her arms, asking her why this was happening.</p>
<p>Nitaga moved tiredly, Nitaga wanted to struggle to stand up. She said [Rasputin charmed me! He wanted to insult me, and in the end, I saw him go to … Lina's room… He wants her too. I … saw him in a daze, but … I didn't have the strength to call for help.] (To be continued)</p>
