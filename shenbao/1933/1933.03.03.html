<h3 id="c5">滬戰撤兵紀念 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>穗</p>
<p>今日爲去年苦鬥月餘迭挫强敵之我軍。自上海全綫總退却之日。以此退却。遂使血紅之敵旗。得以揷遍淞滬。而一月又二日艱苦抗争之成績亦遂付諸東流。吾人猶憶去年今日。無論何人。聽此一消息。殆無不爲之椎胸頓足。悲憤欲絶。今事隔一年矣。爲問國人。此沉痛之一年。究如何度過。在此一年中。吾人又究曾做何事。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人之所以於此沉痛致辭者。非着目於軍事之勝負也。勝負本爲兵家之常事。又况敵挾近代最新式之軍器。以充分之準備。全力來犯。而我則設備簡陋。器械窳舊。亦旣已相持逾月。屢創强敵。使敵三易主將。終不得逞。此種英勇之抗爭。無論如何。已新國際人士之耳目。已爲我民族歷史鑄就永永不可磨滅之光榮。雖最後終於悲壯引退。使淞滬盡遭敵軍鐵騎之蹂躪。然此亦固爲吾人意料以内之事。初無庸深致感喟。獨是吾人認爲淞滬血戰。距今已一年。而此一年來敵則得寸進丈。氣焰日張。我則終始遷延苟安。有若燕巢飛幕。不知自危。滬戰恊定簽定。高歌酣舞者遂一如往昔。去歲此時之荼毒與慘痛。都擲之腦後。熱河挾天險之勝。何以一年以來　毫無準備。今又岌岌危殆。不可終日。此種現象。乃眞足令吾人痛心疾首而末如之何。</p>
<p>夫上海血戰所給予吾人之昭示。明明爲我國之軍隊。非無抗暴自衛之能力與决心。觀乎此次血戰中士兵之英勇沉毅。慷慨赴敵。視死如歸。而退却之日。尤多仰天號哭。即可徴士兵皆具有爲國救死之决心。</p>
<p>三月三日之全綫總撤退。與其謂爲由於寇衆我寡。後援不繼。毋寗謂爲由於全國無抗爭之决心。故血戰逾月。而終至無力持久。此種全國無抗爭之决心。已使淞滬之抗日血戰。終歸失敗矣。今日熱河之事。以吾人之觀察。如舉華北四十萬之重兵。憑居高臨下之天險。更輔之以十九路軍上海抗日之精神。則無論日軍兵器。如何犀利。至少亦足以支持三月之久。而今之結果究將何如耶。</p>
<p>翁照垣氏在淞滬血戰回憶録中有言。「我们的積弱的債。是要若干數目的犠牲去抵銷的。而現在我們已經先付了若干了。我們只繼續努力把牠付淸就是。所以對以前的事件。我們無須乎悲痛和嘆息」。陳銘樞氏亦言。「如果爲了滬戰的敎訓。中國堅决的走向反帝之路。則滬戰將是中國復興的號音。如果中國仍走回頭路。仍然回到爭權奪利的個人戰爭。則滬戰將是中國滅亡的喪鐘」。在今日沉痛紀念中。吾人亦無他言。請即以翁陳兩氏之語。爲國人鄭重複述。並以此爲當今熱河抗日鬥爭之試金石。國人其思之。</p>

<p>周維泰談　鄙人此次由黑河到滬、擬至北平省親、無多躭擱、對於前贊助馬主席抗日之舉、未能貫澈初衷、殊負政府委任之重與國人顧望之殷、事過境遷、不欲以任何意見、向人發表、今旣辱承訪問、雅意拳拳、特將個人經過情形、撮要奉答、至於一年以來軍事行動、與各種計劃、及終於未能挽救之原因、端緖紛繁、非一二言所能盡、亦有非鄙人個人所能答復者茲不詳及、</p>
<p>黑河金廠　鄙人於民國八年、創辦黑河逢源金廠、今十有五年矣、當前此宦遊各省時、年力方强、頗願有所建樹、而時局俶擾、迄無寗期、乃以不入政治潮流、開發邊地實業爲職志、以故非有接洽要公不入省會、吴興權督軍任江省時、屢以要職相維繫、皆經婉詞謝却、以不願易其初志也、上年四月間、馬主席同道至黑河、以前任警備司令時、相知有素、遂以省委相屬、此因固辭不獲、乃以不支薪俸、及收復失地後、准予辭職爲言、始就實業一職、及馬主席督師出發、又以民政警務、俾令兼代、</p>
<p>郎代主席　其時郎掬忱以財政廳長代行主席、徐靑山以警備司令代行副司令官、徐爲馬主席之舊部、郎則舆馬主席素相契合、而鄙人多年之至友也、軍民兩政、集中黑河、遂爲根本重地、維持責任、由三人共同負擔、凡事皆互相計議而行、遇有軍民兩方意見、互有出入、則必以折衷辦法、相機斡旋、以全大體、故自始至終、均能融洽無間、</p>
<p>支持九月　財政爲軍事命脈、一切用人行政、亦必以籌欵爲前提、黑河</p>
<p>向無收入、惟商辦逢源興安兩廠產金、藉以活動市面耳、維時需用浩繁無可籌措、乃以原有官銀號名義、發行紙幣、恃兩次賣行金收用、遠近始能流通、其時若不發纸幣、則成無米之炊、而無兩廠現金又爲無源之水、所能支持九閱月者、頼有此耳</p>
<p>黑河交通　黑河冬春兩季、由旱道通卜奎、夏秋兩季、由水路通哈埠、商賈往來、絡繹不絶、食糧物品、皆由舟車輸入、軍興以來、水陸兩途、均被敵人封鎖、存糧有限、大起恐慌、乃設食糧維持會、計口授食、並以種種方法、回南路各縣購運、更不足則商購於俄境、回鄙人久處邊地、對於各方面、均有相當感情、尙能取信、故公家所不能者、則以商人名義、或個人名義行之、對於各種物質、亦如是辦理、所經困難、不可勝言、其未至陷於絶境者、亦幾希矣、</p>
<p>自造木輪　黑龍江入冬封江、僅夏秋兩季、尙可通行、而風船旣少、又極遲滯、由黑河至奇克羅北一帶、往返動</p>
<p>須月餘、上年夏間、籌慮及此、因於百物缺乏之際、招集商股、搜羅材料、自造木輸一艘、名曰海蘭泡、趕運糧貨、始得無虞、而行旅往來、亦咸稱便利、海蘭泡者黑河之原名、因以名之也、</p>
<p>地廣人稀　黑河沿邊午餘里、地廣人稀、盜賊出没無常、爲患已久、况當多事之秋、民窮財盡、流而爲匪者、尤所存多有、治安之責、爲警務所專司、因將黑河公安局、力加整頓、先求巿面之安寗、又於冬季成立保安隊二百四十名、所需槍械餉項、由官商合力籌辦、剿除股匪數起、未經蔓延、近日有黑河續行來滬之人、談及彼處治安、仍謂若非此舉、必成匪區也、</p>
<p>團結一致　上述一切維持後方任務、本爲分所當然、即屢以家私補助軍用、及此次脫離黑河、將經營多年之鑛產、與籌辦各種之商業、一槪犧牲、固爲損失重大、但事關救國、亦不足言、惟以械缺兵單、旁無接應、終至不能支持、出於不得已、假道歸國、雖國人能諒苦衷、而回溯實深遺憾、今者北地風雲、日趨險惡、前車旣覆、來軫方遒、應如何團結一致、努力同心、以期摧折强權、收復失地、俾免陷於免亡之境、瞻望前途、所願國人共勉者也、</p>

<p>未失土地固要拚命抵抗</p>
<p>繼續鼓動民衆努力鬬爭</p>
<p>丨前日在靑年會講演丨</p>
<p>中央社云、自熱河戰事發生以來、全國人士、莫不注意、本埠八仙橋靑年會、特發起熱河問题演講會、自一日起、敦請新自華北來滬之熊希龄·黃炎培·臧啓芳·諸君演講三天、前日爲第一日、由黄炎培·臧啓芳兩君演講、聽者至衆、茲將臧氏演詞録下、</p>
<p>九一八後　方綏聽黃任之先生講演燅河的情形、和全國的人、應當如何努力、以達到保守熱河的目的、進而收復東北、這是人人時時刻刻不應忘的、現在兄弟就九一八事變後到現在的東北情形、向各位說說、我们現在爲什麽要死守熱河、爲的是將來要收復東北、熱河問題旣是由東北問題發生的、我們的目光、便應該在熱河軍事緊急時侯、照顧到東北那塊地方、</p>
<p>應當如何　現在日本集中兵力、進攻熱河、是因爲他們認定目前東北義勇軍業已肃淸、没了後顧之憂、進攻熱河、卽所以保守東北、日本的計劃如此、我們應當如何、我們應當把東北始終抗日的民衆鼓動起來、使他們認爲、肅淸的、實在並未肅淸、一面擾亂他們的後方、使们們的原定計劃、不能實現一面牽掣他們的兵力、使我們的熱河、把守得格外牢固、因此、目前集中全國的力量、於應援熱河之外、仍不要忘掉東北、就是同時要作抵禦和收復的工作、以下兄弟把九一八事變後、東北的情形、分作五個時期來講、</p>
<p>第一時期　第一個時期是九一八事變到江橋戰役、就是由一十年九月十八日至十一月四日、九一八夜瀋陽事變發生、長春開原鐡嶺四平街及其他南满鐡路沿綫各地、同時被佔、直到二十一日、奪據吉林、不過數日、遼吉兩省大部失陷、在那時地方文武大吏、除退却外了無辦法、這是東北失掉的主要原因、民衆方面、事先對於事變毫無知覺、毫無準備、一旦國土淪陷、其痛可知、但因毫無準備之故、亦自束手無策、這是第一期的情形、　　第二時期　第二個時期、是由江橋戰役到錦州撤兵、日人於佔據遼吉兩省以後、更企圖奪取黑龍江省城和哈爾濱、他們以爲不拿到這兩個地方、不能逹到他們呑併東北的目的、也就不能有去年三月一日僞國之出現、所以日人對於黑哈的文武大吏、肆行恫嚇、想要拿攫得遼吉的同樣方法、取得黑哈、但遼吉失陷、是因爲地方文武大吏不抵抗、雙手奉讓、民衆無準備、毫無辦法、在黑哈則情形完全不同、民衆鋻於遼吉失失陷的經過、到處奔走、作决心守土的運動、最顯著的、是省市黨部和商會、聯合起来、督促地方當局誓死抗日、可巧馬占山將軍、以黑河鎭守使奉命代理江省主席、到省之後、卽揭起抗日旗幟、和日本打起来了、但馬將軍回省時、省庫空虚、至於要拿三十元錢買菜都没有、其困難可知、因爲藉黑哈兩地民衆應援的力量、軍隊給養、才漸有辦法、可是馬將軍收集不相統屬的部隊、去抵抗日人的堅甲利兵、本難獲勝、但由十一月四日至十一月二十日、半月苦戰、使日軍傷亡數千、實是日人在佔據遼吉時所萝想不到的、直到黑省不能保守、始退往海倫、以便和哈埠互相呼應、退海倫後、維持至二十年年底、在這兩個月内、遼吉黑民衆、希望一件事情、就是錦州尙在我手、應從速將關内大軍集中錦州、如果日軍西進、便和他决一死戰、所以到處醞釀義勇軍之組織、作政府的後盾、民衆全希望去伴殺敵的爱國志士、但是二十一年一月二日、我國軍隊、又輕輕將錦州放棄、東北民衆失望的情形、可想而知了、然而民衆抗日的實力、業已澎湃勃興起來、這是第二期的情形、</p>
<p>第三時期　第三個時期、是由錦州撤兵到馬占山將軍再起抗日、錦州撤兵、民衆的抗日運動、雖受了一點打撀、但是抗日精神、特别滋長、過了不久的光景、哈埠失陷、二月五日日軍大部開入哈埠、三月一日、僞國成立、日人更到處以兵力壓制、民衆的抗日力量不免少受挫折、這是第三期的情形、</p>
<p>第四時期　第四個時期、是由去年四月三日、馬占山將軍逃出黑省、再起抗日、到本年一月二日、山海關失守、在這個時期裏、民衆眞和日人浴血苦戰、日人死亡不下兩萬人、此種情實、外間不甚明瞭、報紙也從未統計、因爲中國方面没有調查、日人對於眞相又不宣布、所以外間對於日軍的死傷、全不知確數、其實最低限也有兩萬人、這並不是故事的宣掦、可以拿出實在證據、有一位義勇軍的領袖、姓名不必宣布、曾經用計引誘日軍一旅團、到窪下的地方、把他們全部消滅了、獲得步槍二千零五十枝、鐡帽一千有餘、該旅團長的頭顱、就拿他自己用的軍刀切下、像這樣的事件、不在少數、外間僅知東北有王德林·馮占海·李海靑·等部的苦戰、其實除他們之外、還有三千五千以至一萬的許多部隊、遍布三省、因爲交通不便、對外不甚宣傳、不打電報、所以外間一点不知、我們還有一個證據、就是日人戰死、絶不令尸體失掉、爲搶回一個尸體、雖再犠牲數人、亦所不惜、搶回之後、用火焚化、裝入木匣之内、南满鐡路一個茶役、傳出消息、由五月到九月、天天均有此項木匣往回運送、每天不下二三百隻、合攏算起來、說日人死了兩萬、實是從少估計、因爲這種原故、所以日人直到去年冬天、對於義勇軍、還没有辦法、這個時期、是義勇軍最活動的時期、也是給日本一種深痛鉅創的時期、</p>
<p>第五時期　第五個時期、是由去年冬底到目下、這個時期、情形與從前大異、馬蘇退入俄境、馮李退回熱河、王德林也有一部份退到俄境、所以日人認爲義軍已被肅淸、集中兵力圖熱、但是過去在東北奮鬥的、實不衹這幾部份、乃是這幾部份和其他許多股義軍、共同抗日、這些股未退出東北的義勇軍、此刻或暫時濳伏、或假與妥協、至少還有三十萬人、不過這時期是最緊要的關頭、作到好處、可使日人不能安枕、疲於奔命、否則不但東北收復無期、熱河華北、亦恐難保、就是全國也有很大的危險、現在更分别講講、</p>
<p>三個問題　（一）日人現在打跑了大股的抗日軍隊、對於其餘的許多小股、完全想要拿金錢收買、不受收買的、就收繳他們的槍械、他們爲保存槍械、不能不暫和日人妥協、這種妥協、爲暫時的敷衍之計、則可、長久繼續下去、危險便極大、因爲人是容易習於安樂的、没有痛苦、必要忘掉亡國之恨、的以應當趁日人尙未逹到以金錢收買的目的以前、要把他們鼓動起來、使他們永久抗日、（二）在熱河方面、如果能抵抗三個月、東北民衆、就是赤手空拳、也願意和日本拼命、假令不能支持很久、一抵抗便失敗、東北民衆、仍免不了要失望、所以現下一方、須積極援助熱河、一方趕緊接濟在東北抗日的武裝同志、使他們知道政府抵抗的决心、（三）東北民衆的抗日、絶不是爲的官爵、容或有爲官爵的、也是極少數、官軍的抵抗、或爲獎賞、民衆的抵抗、是爲保全身家性命和祖宗墳墓的、所以政府方面、</p>
<p>不設法獎勵捨命救國的義勇軍、東北抗日的民氣、就有逐漸消沉的危險、這三个問題、是極關重要的、此外東北義勇軍之缺乏聯络及指導、那是局部的問題、好解决的、</p>
<p>两個例證　總之、現在所以要和日人拼拿的、因爲東北存亡、就是中國存亡的關鍵、這話並不是口頭禅、證據十分確鑿、現下舉兩個例子來說、（一）黃先生方纔提到中國對外貿易、去年入超、特别增多、共四萬萬海關兩、諸位知道是什麽原因、是因爲東北的失陷、就對外貿易額講、中國内部每年是入超、東三省每年是出超、東三省對外貿易數額、佔全國三分之一、這是就經濟命脈講、東北佔很重要的地位、（二）東北土土、尙未盡數開發、河北山東、各省民衆、每年遷往東北的、有百萬之多、除春去冬歸者外、留居東北者、每年亦不下五十萬、内地各省人口稠密、東北可以作爲容納的尾　、中國人口過剩的問题、可以有法解决、這是就移民講、東北佔很重要的地位、再有國際上、日俄兩國、回然重视東北、就是英美也認爲東北與世界繁榮有關、不願被日本獨呑、總之、由經濟上和國際上觀察、不是東北亡掉、和中國無關、可以說東北亡、中國必亡、並非危言耸聽、　　三个結論　我们根據以上所說的情形、可以得到三個結論、第一、由九一八事變起、東北各地、繼續淪陷、以致現下不易收拾、這不是物力不濟、是心理太弱、東三省兵工廠所存槍砲子彈極多、飛機也有二百多架、物力何嘗太壞、然因心理太弱的關係、就一退而再退了、返觀東北民衆的武力、以自衛槍枝、僅帶有一百或二百粒的子彈、還能抵抗一年半、更可以明瞭了、第二、我们要問是應先收復東北再講民族復興呢、還是先求復興、再去收復東北呢、我們的結論、是不先收復東北、中國民族絶難復興、所以現下應當努力先收復東北、然後再講民族復興、第三、東北民衆抗日精神、雖尙熱烈、但是很有被日人收買的危險、所以願全國民衆、於注意熱河以外、纰續努力接濟東北義勇軍、務必使他們抗日精神和動作、繼長增高、而不要逐漸消沉</p>
<p>全國責任　最後、我們認淸以上三個結論、還可以得到一總結論、就是熱河能守到三個月、固是如天之福、卽使守不到三個月、也不要灰心失望、一旦熱河不保、我們可用接濟並鼓動東北民衆的方法、也來接濟並鼓動熱河民衆、總之、未失掉的土地、要拚命抵抗、拚命保守、已失掉的土地、要永久不承認失掉、繼續鼓動民衆努力鬥爭、這豈不是未丢的有辦法、丢了的也有辦法嗎、最後、還有一句話、東北協會創立伊始、希望全國同胞、全能參加、作東北協會的會員、因爲收復東北和建設東北、是全國同胞的責任、</p>
<p>時人行蹝錄</p>
<p>軍政部長何應欽、昨晚十一時三十分、乘京滬路七次夜車返京、</p>
<p>外交委員會委員長伍朝樞、昨晨八時、由京乘夜車抵滬</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、定今日午後、乘特快車出京、可於今晚十一時二十分抵滬、</p>
<p>林康侯</p>
<p>爲救國庫券之聲明</p>
<p>國闻社記者、昨赴銀行公會、晤林秘書長康侯、詢其有何金融上之意見、可以發表、據林君云、迄今實無所表示、惟余之地位、余之立塲、對於有益國家之意見、極願貢獻於新聞界、但有一重要之聲明、余以專冗談話極簡括、而記者諸君、往往爲盡量發揮起見、不免有增益之處、致易失其眞意、卽如前數日有人詢余救國庫券事、余所說者、僅云救國库券宋院長在平津時與北方各銀行接洽就緖、當無問题云云、而某報所載、尙有另發公債若干、銀行界可以承受等語、余絶對無此談話、應請代爲更正、况鄙人服務銀行界十餘年、在銀行公會又五六年、各銀行負擔之重、豈有不知、足以證明無上述之說、</p>

<p>請願修改海商法</p>
<p>上海航業界、因立法院通過海商法、其第二十三條中所訂條文、與航商甚屬不利、且爲事實上所不能辦到、特公推代表赴京請願、要求修正、亟將大概情形查記如下、</p>

<p>「L&gt;讀者顧問</p>
<p>「P&gt;兒女之累</p>
<p>丨木埠法華君來信</p>
<p>讀了你給覆任望月君的「我的自殺，觀對否」一文我覺得很满意，雖然我從没有想過自殺，可是你給　他的　很對！</p>
<p>現在我這有一個歷年來擱着不能解决的問题，我希望你同樣的給我一個好好的指導。</p>
<p>我結過婚已經四年了、外子和我雖没有像時下的靑年男女們所有的濃烈　愛情，但我們都有要站在平民大衆的陣營中推翻現有的不良制度　建設合理的社會的意志，這意志使们們牢牢的結合着。我們要鬭爭，要和這現在社會作殊死　！然而，不幸的很！我剛逃脱家庭的羈絆，接着便陷於兒女的羈絆！在三年中我们先後生兩個孩子！這樣一來，我們從來的所謂努力奮鬭，前途事業，和　勢力的鬥爭都有形無形地給孩子和生活的問題消滅了大半了！</p>
<p>在這樣的社會底下，祇有鬭爭才有出路！然而，怎樣去鬭爭呢？孩子的問题究如何解决了把牠抛棄飛，這實在很難做到！等待牠相當的成長然後作其他的事情罷，好更是夢話！爲了這一問題我天天的苦惱着，因此請你給我一個　　的指導！</p>
<p>答：三誦來書，不勝浩歎，而女士夫婦之爲社會服務與　鬥熱忱，溢於言表，此又記者所欽偑無已者也。女士夫婦爲女妇所累，有志莫伸，此則現在靑年男女的一般情形，關係社會前途，實非淺鮮。記者之怒，應分兩層辦法。第一層；你們兩位自今而後不要再生子女，不過女士不要誤會，記者絶不是修道士也不是淸凈絶滅之徒。勸人斷絶人生的必然的要求。乃是要勸兩性方面除解决兩人性慾問題外。不要再生出枝節問題丨生育。解决這個問題，我且介紹下面兩部書給女士：（一）節制生育問題（程浩編，亞東圖書館版）；（二）人類的性生活（前人編，亞東版）。第二層：女士夫婦兩人旣然生了兩個孩子，自然不能把他們抛棄不問。若果有殷實的人家老而無子歡喜承受這兩個小孩做螟蛉子的，那你們就趕快地把他們送把他，彼此都「得其所哉」。若果没有這種奇遇，那只好暫時撫養，自然送到育嬰堂去也可以，此外只有一法：女士暫且犧牲一下，先請女士的良人謀　職業敷衍度日，或則你們兩位都能找到職業或他項相當的工作，那把就孩子們寄養别人家或特别同幼稚園辦交涉，請那裏代養，雖然經濟上要爲難一點，不過你們兩位都可以脫開身子做事，於自身於社會都有益。但是這種事情要因各人的環境不同而異其應付手段，記者所言，不過聊供參攷而已。而且這也不是什麽盡善盡美的辦法。總而言之，在現社會内，像女士提出的這種問題絶無圓满解决之望，說到這兒，又鼓起我的熱情了；假使兩位能爲社會去奮鬥，以自己的精神，力量，愛情都放在苦難羣衆上，那兩個小孩倒成爲次要或不重要的問題了。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>蘇城某姓修理屋後石駁岸，　匠拆卸未及半，忽然發現一個直徑可二尺許的小圓潭，内蓄輕魚若干尾，活潑潑地在游泳自得，微風吹過，水面上居然也會起着淪漪。魚從那裏游來的？水從何處取到的？這便引起了許多工人及觀衆的駭怪。</p>
<p>若說魚是從河中游来的，這個小圓潭高出河面有五六尺高，魚不生翼，怎會飛到這裏來呢？至於水的來源，益發不可思議，這是積水，已有半個月不曾降雨，那裏來的水，會得積在小潭裏呢？正在彼此猜疑不决的當兒，恰有一個老農經過，笑說：「這是鄉間常見的事，掘見了小</p>
<p>小魚潭，一定可以掘見水獺窝；大概這駁岸年深月久，裏面已有了水獺窝，水獺窝的附近，它一定掘成一個小潭，到池塘中吸取淸水，吐入裏面，又把小魚銜入潭中，常年的蓄養着；遇到水獺要想吃魚而懶於入水去捕捉的時候，便把祭養的小魚就近供給它的食料，所以知道小小魚潭附近，一定有水獺窝。」衆人聽了，疑信參半；待到繼續拆卸，果然發現了一個巢穴雖不見水獺，却見巢中有水獺脫下的餘毛，那便證實了老農的一篇經騐之談。</p>
<p>池潭，本是魚類的國度，但是，這個出於水獺包辦的二尺直徑小圓潭，只可說是水獺組織的僞邦丨傀儡國水獺爲什麽組織這個傀儡國？原來便是供给水獺自己的糧食，可憐這死在目前的輕魚若干尾，還要自得其樂的在裏面游行，而忘郤水獺　便在左近，它們遲早要做水獺的一頓點心！以小比大，這呌做東洋水獺满洲魚。</p>
<h3 id="c125">從紙鳶感想到鐵鳥 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>丨去年今日大不同丨</p>
<p>在這春光駘蕩，春風和煦的當兒，你祇要跑到郊野地方去玩玩，碧草平舖的曠塲上總有不少活潑的兒童，大放其紙鳶。一根綫牽着；順着那風摇曳着，重於空氣的紙鳶便慢慢的上升。它在空中的情景，我可引用兩句古文來形容，便是東坡所說的：「浩浩乎如憑虚御風，而不知其所止：飄飄乎如遺世獨立，羽化而登仙。」眞是值得玩賞的一件玩意兒呀！</p>
<p>回想到去年的今日。上海的天空，不論滬南·闸北·近郊·四鄕，那裏見紙鳶的影子。我們的領空，满佈着旭日的鐵鳥。只要聽見軋軋的聲音；和三三兩兩的徘徊着，恐怖之神，燬滅之神，死神，這許多神是要降臨了！按理，彼以鳥來，吾以鳥往，空中也可以顯顯身手。可憐我們的鐵鳥，想是羽毛未豐的緣故，和紙鳶一般的躱得無影無踪。</p>
<p>今年的現在，上海的一隅，暫時的平安了。兒童玩的紙鳶，星羅棋佈的在空中出風頭。不過我希望下次有事的時候，我們清白色的鐵鳥，也像紙鳶一般的多。再不要躱在鳥窠裏，给人家打死老虎。</p>
<p>從紙鳶而想到鐵鳥，眞呌人哭笑不得。末了我對於紙鳶的沿革。也有一些小小的感觸。</p>
<p>紙鳶的創造，有些人說是韓信偵察楚兵而發明的，正史上没有記載，想是稗官家言吧！還有獨異志上記載着說：「侯景圍臺城，简文放紙鳶至城外，以乞援兵。」</p>
<p>看了上邊的傳說，已知道紙鳶也具有鐵鳥的偵察功用，不過從前是簡陋些罷了！紙鳶已發明了幾千年，到了現在，仍是這樣的紙鳶。列强正在拼命的造鐵鳥，我們不要看了玩弄的紙鳶，錯認是自已的鐵鳥咧！</p>
<h3 id="c126">餘燄的權威 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>

<p>丨燬滅了蕭信菴丨</p>
<p>宜興蕭信菴女士，在南洋自焚而死·「全身燃着，變爲火棍」·「肉已燔熟，無法救治」，慘呀！</p>
<p>蕭女士焚死於熊熊然有形之火燄吗？我説：「非也」；燬滅蕭女士的，却是看不見嗅不着的所謂「舊理諭」「舊觀念」的餘燄。</p>
<p>「聞女士南來時，其兄曾力阻之，及船中事發覺，其兄益引爲大憾·致書與之斷絶親係;說者謂此爲女士自殺原因之一云,」國聞社這樣説：</p>
<p>我們貴國的社會一般觀念，是「安分」，是「守己」，即如職業問題，亦不主張「冒險」和「創造」</p>
<p>本來這種觀念，歷史深長，根深蒂固·管子說：「士之子恒爲士，農之子恒爲農，工之子恒爲工」·韓非子說：「家有常業，雖饑不餓」，從這種「恒」化「常」化的職業觀念，演化而爲後來的「安分」「守己」的職業觀念，姚石甫說；「爲子孫者，必有創業之志，而後可以守成；必有戒禍之心，而後可以休世」·紀大奎説：「凡習藝業，做買賣，總要一心歸正，守天理，安本分，凡一切冒險駕空的生意，切不要做」，這種「守成」「戒禍」「守天理」「安本分」的觀念，中國幾千年來，不知道被他呑滅了多少富於「冒險思想」和「創造精神」的靑年·雖說這種吃人的舊觀念，近來已革新了不少；可是他的餘燄，仍是不斷地燃燒着·　　所謂「鬚眉男子」懾於舊觀念的餘燄的權威，而不敢有所作爲的，還不知道有多少。</p>
<p>大膽的蕭女士，以「巾幗中人」竟不存「戒禍之心」，不「安本分」，渡重洋，適異域，「冒險」南行，覔食他邦，何怪伊的令兄要「力阻之」·不幸，途中又遭逢意外之「禍」·又何怪伊的令兄「益引爲大憾，與之斷絶親係」呢？</p>
<p>餘燄的權威，竟燬滅了宜興蕭女士！竟燬滅了成千成萬不知姓名的蕭女士！</p>

<p>— 陳伊農</p>
<p>那位屈原老夫子，眞是出人意外，也來談談戀愛，但是他老人家太不自量了，他旣不是小白臉，又没有萬能的金錢，如何能够打動少女的心絃，去與他講戀愛呢？如此只好把他的君王，權充美人，來玩一册同性而兼單戀的滑稽戲。但是他的成績，仍不過是[思美人兮鑒涕而竚貽」，最後還要請他老人家去做一具汩羅江中的浮屍，以符失戀後的原則。咎由自取，夫復何言！</p>
<p>現在有一位摩登美女，伊遠竚在太平洋的東岸，恰巧與一位與屈老夫子同身世的C老先生銀漢相隔，脈脈含情。伊生長富人之家，芳容直如出水芙蓉一樣美，遂惹得那位C老先生起了好逑之念，寤寐難安。可是那位美人兒，雖「時容與以微動」，却又「踟蹰而不來」，C老先生眞望得目眩心焦，只好大嚷大呌道：[美人兒呀，我眞想你呵！我眞愛你呵！可是你竟如此的忍心，我就要爲你而焦死了，你快來救我的命呵！」這位C老先生雖是這樣舌敝脣焦的大嚷大呌，而那位美人，仍是若聞若不聞，遂引得一羣生長在苗峒裏的倭子，不住的暗笑道：　　「大家快來看癩蝦蟆想吃天鵝肉啊！」　我看了這段情形，不住的替這位禀性誠實的C老先生擔心，只得這樣的警告他老人家道：</p>
<p>老C！别再這樣的痴心妄想。倘是你老人家再如此下去，而不别求新生命，那就要你去做一具太平洋中的浮屍了。趕快揮開慧劍，斬斷情絲，以求自救罷！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>像半爿車輸一樣的明月，掛到了純黑色的天幕底中央，夜漸漸深了；林木裏伏着的五十個待死的勇士，有一半是給疲乏所征服而睡去了，有一半也因隔河的倭子無所舉動，而漸漸地懈怠了。</p>
<p>倭子眞是最刁滑，最殘暴，最···的東西。突然，在天色將明，田家莊人馬困倦到了極點的時侯，乘着風勢，望柳林中射來了無數的火箭；霎時間，空氣裏佈满了硫磺的臭味火球，火把不住的飛過河來，烈熖到處活躍着，柳林立刻成爲火林了。</p>
<p>不消說，現「田家兵」忙着避火的當兒，倭子打浮橋擁過來了「孩兒們！今日之事，有死而已」！田莊主的大刀，在火光中飛舞着，接連斫死了十多個衝前鋒的倭子，同時發出了决死的號令。老二，老三，老五，丨整隊的人，便在莊院前的廣塲上，像瘋狂似的和比他們多出三四十倍的倭子們格鬥着，槍斷，用劍，劍折，用拳，拳曲，便踢，　，撞吼，丨死。</p>
<p>姑母統率幾個女人，也不曾有一個後退，齊把鮮血灌漑了泥土「衝進去」！跳過了屍身和血漬點綴着的廣塲，倭子很得意地踱進了田莊主的老家，领袖們像魔鬼似的坐满了一堂。　　「又死了一個」！厨房裏起了一陣小的格鬥，在搜查着的倭子，報告又殺死了一個害病的中國人。「現在，這裏所有的活着的东西，便衹剩這條狗了」！他很得意地指着階下的一條害着癩病的花狗。</p>
<p>「汪∶∶∶汪∶∶∶汪」花狗彷佛是特地裝假病的一樣，立刻睜大了一雙红燈似的眸子，張牙舞爪的撲上堂來，奮力咬斷了中間一個最大的首領的頭頸，當然它也馬上給倭子們斬成了幾段。</p>
<p>遠處的雞聲，很嘹亮地啼着，朝陽放下金红色的簾幕，結束了這一幕悲壯的短劇。　（完）</p>

<p>實在曪，我並不是說小館子會有若干好的，而我又何嘗不想像劉姥姥似的去進大館子，可是說起了大館子，也只有想起了大館子而已，一來是區區身上没洋裝，一來是區區囊中没洋鈿，丨再則呢？天知道，本來，大館子之所以能成立，自有它的高貴處，自有它的神妙處，也有它的顧客在，反正，小館子是一樣丨</p>

<p>在北四川路可以看見廣東店出賣的一種黑色硬殻虫，裝在玻瓶裏，與「鴨肫肝」之類並排。呌做「各味龍虱」。（這名字也很夠味兒！）我告訴你，這是好吃東西！永安公司糖果部售價六角錢一磅。廣東人稱蟑螂（卽油虫）曰［卡札］。這種龍虱據說就是「水卡札」。科学名詞我考據不出，請指敎。總之這是一種六足甲虫，生於水稻田間，足有毛如烏蹼。夏天捉來，加以「和味」調製，炒之乾熟，名和味龍虱。吃時去足殻，入口香鹹，如嚼花生，但微有「卡札」之臊羯味。像這樣的東西也拿來吃，廣東人實在是不可思議的，</p>
<p>一年前大世界曾有日人賣藝者專啖毒虫，蝦蟆蜈蚣蜘蛛尤所喜好，一時見者警嘆。我想這浸甚希奇。日本人天生一副猴子般的胃壁，什麽都可以充飢。一個頭陀背了小包袱吃草根果芥便可以行遍島國。廣東人比起他們，只是較「文明」一點而已。廣東人吃蛇鼠　龜蚧，最毒則最上乘。還有「禾蟲」。這簡直是與粪蛆一樣的東西。黃荳芽般大，彩色，生於水田，一碗满盛，蠕蠕而動，舉亂刀斬之，砧上便全是漿液，煮熟頗似蟹羔。否則原形煎炒亦可以，上海幾十萬廣東人，你問他蟹粉與禾蟲孰善，他會說，「唉！這是簡直不能比擬的。」但是事實上，在上海，他們是衹能吃到一些「生晒禾蟲乾」。</p>

<p>烚赤市况昨極平、交易亦少、塲内成交僅由同行中盈豐恒及大豐恒互相對做、計照加十二兩、</p>

<p>外匯晨緊午鬆交易亦稀</p>
<p>昨市匯兌上午尙稱緊張、下午則趨鬆弛、成交亦少、初因倫敦大條近期俱見微縮O六二五、英對美小半分、美對英降一分二五、近期英匯開出甚平、爲一先令八便士一八七五、紐約銀價雖未更動、而五金交易所遠期銀價則縮二厘、銀行私電遂跌一八七五、人心亦好、近期美匯開出念八元六八七五、較之前收緊起一二五、開後逐漸加緊、六月份美金由念九元二五做至一二五、蓋因匯豐掛牌英美俱小一二五而更俏也、午收時稍平而帶鬆、下午交易甚少、惟市况不佳、銀行胃口趨塞、但以金市尙穩、稍見拉住、延至收盤近期出價、計英匯一先令八便士一二五、美匯念八元六二五、但此價有O六二五伸縮、六八七五有願結之可能、蓋收市時成交少而帶恍惚、銀行如安逹·運通·正金·華比·和豐居於買方·花旗·上海等居於賣方、金業初塞而後略扒、一日間先令平平、美匯則有一二五回顧、結果較之前收先令緊Ｏ六二五、美匯約緊一二五、今將銀行進出錄後、</p>

<p>厘拆早午兩價相埒</p>
<p>昨日洋厘仍有市價、與前日相伯仲、惟交易依然細疏、然銀行以頭觀充斥、無收買機會、結果收市時間亦不甚　、而人跡亦不若往日之盛、銀根狀况、在目前無吃緊機會、故始終無緊鬆可紀云、</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<p>紗花市没精打采</p>
<p>紗市仍屬平澹、以金融枯涸、各方商業凋敝在此春銷之際、各帮皆無採辦力、兼之時局混亂、人心尤弱、據一部份調查、各廠存紗日厚、且華北紗廠之紗運滬傾銷、所以就大勢論之、紗市殊難趨高、</p>
<p>人標平淡</p>
<p>人標前市開盤、美棉雖漲、市氣極疲、因買户缺乏、各月微跌一·二錢、午後市象稍軟、事時消息不佳、跌一·二錢、惟八月份漲二錢、全日成交統計一萬一千四百包、查賣出立昶三千包、長餘五百包、義餘四百五十包、明德五百五十包、買進大豐八百包、長豐五百包、德記四百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>花市平靜、趨勢尙硬、因多頭吸收之額不放且美棉又漲、買力心思頗挺、然國内時局紛亂、日軍侵略尤甚、紗銷停頓、廠方處於困難地位、對於高價之原料拒絶不進、而印棉售價較廉、故山東·天津·等處之現棉市價鬆落、午後有一部份賣出矣、</p>
<p>鄭標尙穩</p>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、隨外棉漲一·二錢、午後市况略疲、各月趺五分至一錢半、全日成交統計三萬四千五百担、查賣出長豐二千六百担、廣豐一千八百担、吉豐一千一百担、榮興一千一百担、恒德二千九百担、買進　記二千六百担、仁豐一千八百担、益豐二千九百担、恒益一千担、餘昶二千四百擔、收盤價如下：</p>

<p>洋麥旺到後</p>
<p>期麥賣方乘機壓抑</p>
<p>昨日期麥一致呈疲落之象、以目下洋麥進口、數額甚巨、行家套貨、因大廠均無需要、底落呆滯、因之一般浮多、極度不安、客盤中買氣大盛、市進低落、下午幸有華豐收進本月份、約計十車、市稍　住、否則跌到一綫、亦未可知、遠期各月份、人心亦不見佳、喊價步落、結果本月份較前日跌四分、（最低至三兩一錢半）四月份跌四分、七月份跌二分云、</p>
<p>期粉所跌尙微</p>
<p>昨日粉市、大致量平疲之象、以洋麥報價雖似好一角左右、惟市塲人心、虚軟、以各廠存底、自洋麥暢到、逐步增多、且聞本月份各廠抛售、亦尙巨大、一般業外浮外、彷佛已失憑藉、北方時局、因熱河形勢、暫見不利、實銷胃口、亦又停頓、故各月份因買氣稀淡、终趨疲頓、不過各廠方面、亦防將來戰事之擴大、對於抛貨、大致觀望、所以趨勢雖不佳、跌度則尙無幾也、結果本月份較前日跌五厘、四月份微好二厘半、五月份不動六月份小二厘半、七八月份小五厘云、</p>
<p>一般豆市都呈穩象</p>
<p>「赤荳」市况尙穩、成交浦東杜赤二百三十包、三兩四錢、崇明沙赤四百餘包、三兩九錢、</p>

<p>糖市　　粗砂白稍見穩定</p>
<p>昨日糖市以標金轉升、荷匯回縮、趨勢稍定、公會劃盤二四粗砂白、前日原價乏受、昨日交易較多、源記曾劉出五六百包、價爲十五兩四錢二分半、二十號中砂白十五兩一二錢、荷赤八號十一兩九錢、九號十二兩、受手仍缺、潮帮號家開出足上冰棉白五十餘包、價十六兩、潮靑僅開出三十餘包、價九兩三錢三、建帮號家開出統手冰二十箱、每砠爲十二兩三、　　南北貨　　大粒桂圓號盤抬高</p>

<p>大粒桂圓貨品純正者邇來到貨軋缺、昨號貨僅五六十箱、各行進意特濃一時互相爭進、開價抬起二三兩、立即兌光、查稄轉貨、電　亦僅三百餘箱、市面經此一抬、暫時可期穩定云、</p>
<p>五金　馬口鐡今日有萬餘箱可到</p>
<p>丨津帮動辦軍用五金品丨</p>
<p>現貨寥少之馬口鐡、今日新太古棧有一萬數千箱可到、查内中如火油公司及香烟公司等有六千餘箱、此外悉爲本街同業之定貨、又聞津帮對於軍用五金已有購辦、如花園鉛絲、昨購去三百捆、價四兩五錢、十十號户鉛皮十桶、價二十五兩、比前暴漲一兩餘、馬口鐡九十磅辦去五百箱、價十三兩五錢、八號十號十二號等新鉛絲等亦有購去、</p>
<p>絲茶　　歐美絲電仍不見轉</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲銷仍無活動之勢、　入週以來、海外絲價仍有跌無漲、紐約生絲交易所期絲拍價奇小、三四·五月份期絲（卽標準日絲）價祇扯合華銀每包四百二三十兩、致滬埠白廠經等去電均嫌價昻而不轉、昨日上午法莊等雖有白廠經等電報發往里昂、而各廠商開價Ｂ字等級十三十五條份仍須五百四五十兩、恐雖如期轉滬、絲市前途、益呈暗淡、白厰經現貨仍祇内地用户續有購進云、</p>
<p>人造絲客銷淸疲</p>
<p>近兩日中、歐美人造絲客銷步趨淸疲、緣各客帮手中存貨充厚、進胃不起、昨祇杭紹帮慶記等莊在公會上抛成三·四月份人造絲期貨二十五箱、價仍平疲、</p>
<p>疋頭　　格子華特呢仍然暢銷</p>
<p>夾色格子華特呢、目卜仍極暢銷、本客帮續有添要、零疋整箱逐日均有售開、普通牌子如德記寗豐等一律售二兩八錢、選色拆疋蓋印酌加五分、銷路良好、市氣挺俏、黃褐色棕灰西服舖多有搜羅、新到之人字及條子華特呢、銷路比格子尤爲活　、恒利五豐牌子、故喊售三兩一錢半淨盤、買方爭相購配、因其市存稀少、花色雅宜耳、聞其定價爲三先令二辦士云、</p>

<h3 id="c131">「洋涇浜」與「世界語」 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>蕭伯訥在北平招待新闻記者。有人詢以來華棧，習得華語否？蕭氏曰：「否；余一字不知。但余對洋涇浜語，頗感興趣。蓋大半文字，太受文法拘牽；洋涇浜語則無此弊。余信此語或將成未來之世界語。」葉記者告以華文實際上即不講文法。蕭氏曰：「然則，華文將來或可爲世界語耳」。（見二月二十三日天津大公報）</p>
<p>這段語，蕭伯納推测得有趣，某記者幼稚得可笑。歐西學者對於中國文字，從聲音上研究的多；和中國文字學者側重形義，方向略有不同。蕭伯納對於洋涇浜語發生興趣，亦是方向不同之故。不過他老先生决不知道在他以前，早有人說過這個話。大槪六年以前，吴稚暉談論國音，世界語，他已從世界話的立塲，推斷洋涇浜有成爲世界語的可能。世界語的最重要條件，一要拼音方法簡單，二要文法規則简單。洋涇浜語即具有第二個美點，如：</p>
<p>「Ｔhe　stemer　has　two　eye，</p>
<p>No　oye　how　can　see</p>
<p>No　can　see,how　can　walk」</p>
<p>(譯）那隻輪船有兩隻眼睛，（指前面兩盞燈）</p>
<p>没有眼睛，如何能夠看見，</p>
<p>不能看見，如何能夠跑。</p>
<p>他們以中國的語法運用英國的拚音文字。大膽地把英國文法改造一過。這種大膽、對於推進英國語文的進步是極有用處的。但洋涇浜語若和其他語言文字，任其自然生長，經過長時期各個地方的複雜變化，將來也依舊會太受文法拘牽，如現行的歐西各種語文一樣的。世界語的産生必須是简單的規律的，由於人爲而非自然生長的；洋涇浜語其不會成爲未來之世界語，也可斷定了。</p>
<p>至於某記者的混蛋，那簡直該打手心。「文法」是一種說明科學，就旣成現狀而加以歸納，由歸納而得幾個原則，把不合原則的，附上幾個例外。世間豈有不講文法的語言文字嗎？歐西學者對於這方面有研究的非常之多，（睛看ProfGabelentz(德國敎授)之Chinesische　Grammatik（文經緯）某記者莫再丢魄罷！</p>
<h3 id="c132">遊方僧 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>早幾天下大雪，從窗口看出去，街上冷淸淸地没一個生物。街好像比平日狹了些；那麽靜靜地，是變了古畫上的街了。在對面的屋簷下面，比街還冷淸地坐着一個遊方僧，載了頂笠帽，閉着眼，瘦削的骨架上掛着件單薄的衲衣，督督地敲着隻大木魚。風括着，把一片片的雪往他身上吹；雪沾着他的衣襟，就在他身上化了。我瞧着也替他發抖，他却還是一動不動的敲着木魚，連眼珠子也不睜一下的。　　我看見一輛空黄包車在他前面拉過，拉車的縮着脖子，把車扛擱在膈肢窝裏，兩支手縮在袖管裏邊，慢慢地踱着，嘴裏噴着白霧似的水蒸氣。</p>
<p>我看見一個婦人，身上穿得鵝那麽地雍腫，把兩支手放在衣襟底下，一隻醬油瓶露在外面，兩隻耳朶也包在絨帽底下，一隻红鼻子挺在前面，鼻孔裏噴着白霧似的水蒸氣，挨着屋簷，在他前面走了過去。她的膝蓋像是凍僵了似地，直着腿，叉巴着，一拐一拐的。　　以後就再没人來往了。雪越下越大，天也暗了下來。在傍兒的時候，我又看見一個歪戴了頂破瓜皮小帽，穿了件破蔴袋大衣，頭髪直拖到大衣領上，赤脚拖了没跟鞋，袖着手，嘴角上啣着根烟蒂兒，彳亍着過去，噴着白霧似的水蒸氣。</p>
<p>可是那遊方僧還是一動不動地坐在那兒，督督地敲着木魚丨那空虚的，寂寞的聲音啊！</p>
<p>吃晚飯的時候，母親呌傭人拿了一大碗飯，一碗熱湯給他。那傭人隔了會兒，空着手回來說：「给放在那兒了。」</p>
<p>「吃了没有？」</p>
<p>「不吃啊！他就拜了一拜，說了聲兒阿彌陀佛。」</p>
<p>吃完了飯，我跑出去看他。在黑暗裏督督地響木魚的聲音，那灰色的衲衣的衣襟還是舖在地上。我問他：</p>
<p>「師父也該餓了，怎麽不吃一點飯呢？」</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛，出家人是凍餓慣的。」連眼也不睜一下的。</p>
<p>「師父寳寺在那兒？」</p>
<p>「在山西五台山佛光寺。」</p>
<p>「師父出家幾年了？」</p>
<p>忽然他睜開眼來。隔了會兒才說道：「二十三年了。」</p>
<p>「師父怎麽會半路出家的？」</p>
<p>他靜了好一會。「說起來話長。寃孽呢！我本來是五台縣人，我們家隔壁有一個女兒丨丨那麽潔白的一朶蓮花呵！」他低下了腦袋。</p>
<p>我明白了。</p>
<p>可是他又接下去說了這麽一大堆的話；「那時我是一個紈袴子，我是一個專門偷盜處女的貞操的積竊，我天天引誘着她，是的，是我引誘着她。没多少日子，在一個初夏的晚上，在麥田裏，這朶白蓮花開了。有一天，她跪在我前面，她哭，她說肚子裏有了小孩子，她求我娶她回去，可憐的孩子，她是那麽地哀求着的！可是我丨我眞不是人，我站起來啦　，這孩子，是的，這孩子，她怔在那兒。那晩上我也不覺得怎麽。過了三天，她死了，有人說她是吊死的，也有人說她是害急病死的，可是我知道她是怎麽死的。她就葬在我們家後面。接連着十二天，我不能睡，我看見這業障跪在我前面哭。在一個半晚裏，我就跑了出去，跑到五台山，督督地敲着木魚，慚悔着。直到五年前，忽然我又接連着五天夢見她。我明白，她是嫌我苦還受得不夠。我便下山來，在風裏，在雨裏，忍受着鐡似的堅苦∶∶∶」他又督督地敲起木魚來。</p>
<p>回到家裏，我揪着頭髪坐着。我聽見這木魚聲，在靜悄悄的寒夜裏，督督地聲音，一聲一聲地，像敲在我的靈魂上面。九點，十點，十一點，十二點······一個個鐘頭過去，那木魚聲只是重重地在我靈魂上面敲着。忽然我覺得渾身發冷，我跪到地上，在木魚聲裏，我合十，我慚悔。</p>

<p>— 章克標</p>
<p>一切讚美都會的文字，没有不是以夜爲中心，以人工爲骨子的。不過，在事實上，都會中眞個没有晨了嗎？而且那些人工的建設，又是在什麽的基礎之上的？先有了晨，然後有夜，不是早朝上小菜塲去採辦，一頓豐富的飯餐從何而來？太陽從東方出起來時是同樣照着霞飛路的，雖則霞飛路也許不理牠。</p>
<p>但都會不止一個角，上海也不是只有一條霞飛路，那别的路上的太陽光，也有不是被人閑却的，也有些晨是在上海的若干街巷上飛躍的。比方小沙渡，曹家渡，華德路，太陽廟，這些地方的晨是怎樣的？工人羣衆的面上背上肩上的太陽光不是很神氣嗎？不是比之舞女腰上和酒杯底下的燈光更閃耀嗎？</p>
<p>頗有些人讚美都會，頗有些人讚美夜，希望有更多的人来讚美晨，晨至少已催我寫星期雜記了，有人寫了上海夜話，我不能不希望有人出來寫上海晨話。</p>
<p>夜</p>
<p>然而我並不是鄙薄夜的。夜也自有夜的價值，而且在夜間活動的人，也選有比都會人的享樂更有意義的。譬如小竊，譬如剥猪玀的强盜，他們是爲了生活而奮鬭，不算浪費他們的生命。還有些文人著作家常常歡喜在夜深人靜之後寫作星學家的觀測天象，無疑的是要在黑夜，日報的編輯和印刷員工，也是運命註定只在夜間做工。</p>
<p>所以，在夜裏活動的，不一定只有老鼠，蝙蝠，貓頭鷹，娼妓，和純粹的都會人。燈火的美，也不一定要在跳舞塲酒吧間才可以感到，因爲還有徹夜放光的燈塔，指示河海中船舶的進行，卽馬路上的幾盏路燈，也另有一種淸幽。</p>
<p>夜的眞正的韻咏，大約不是在霞飛路北四川路之類的街上所能領略的，更不是在舞塲酒店的燈光之下所能享受的。那些地方所給你的，另是一種迷醉，一種渾陶陶，而夜所要給你的不是這些。　　我說，夜所給予人們的，是一種淸幽，像冷街上路燈的光下所照出的高層建築物的光與影；是一種閑静，像十六舖一帶沿碼頭停泊的船隻浴在月光之下，是一種安息，，像嬰孩在他母親的懹中酣睡；或是一種緊張，像海上管舵人的望着燈塔，像報館印刷工人的從事作業。</p>
<p>夜的獨特的美是在黑暗，星學家只在黑夜裏能窺見明星的秘奥，但在舞塲中充满了人工的燈火，舞女腕上的手電如何好比天上的明星？夜的獨特的美是在靜默，著作家只在靜夜的沈默能興奮他的筆桿，但在酒吧間中充满人聲的嘈嚌，如何會得安適？</p>
<p>根本的錯誤，都會人所到的地方，不是把夜當作夜，他們是在夜間去求畫，這是一種顚倒。因之他們只有求得昏迷，因爲除非是昏迷了才可以將夜作畫。說到反抗自然，他們是没有分的，反抗自然先要認識自然，這先是他們頂怕懼的，他們不敢正視自然一眼，連朝晨的太陽光都不敢起來看的，怎麽能夠希望談到反抗自然！</p>
<p>只有沈淪没落下去的，他們的運命撫法更改了，但我不是就說都會的毁滅，因爲我說過，都會不止一個角度，都會有可從新建設的新基礎。</p>

<p>— 蕭伯納作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>「照此說來，有着什麽可以安慰呢？」克洛凱爾先生說。「我們總是要滅亡的。」「那也不一定，」第一個先生說。</p>
<p>「一定的，」克洛凱爾先生厲聲說。「生命能够在那裏存在的氣温狀况，是已经確知，不成問題的。你不能生活在冰氣的氣温裏，你又不能生活在赤熱的熔爐的氣温裏。無論地球到　這等氣温的那一種，我們總要滅亡的。」</p>
<p>「不！」第一個先生說。「你說的這等氣温只於我們的一部分就是我們的身體，是危害的，我們的身體是幾年之内，就死滅，多半還是花保持着十分的舒服的氣温的那些空氣淸爽的臥房裹。然而造成活體和死體的差異的一種東西呢，要說進多少是依　着氣温的，可有一些證據，一點可能性麽？這雖然有着給本身造那些形式的肉體的豐富這一種奇怪的性質，却的確不是血，不是肉，也不是骨啦。這是無形的東西，如果你竭力要給他定形呢，你得將他當作電磁波，當作震動率，當作以木　的轉動，如果以太是有的，換句話說，就是當作這樣的一種東西；這東西如果存在着丨而且誰能够懷疑於他的存在呢？丨那就能够存在於最冷的死星上，或者太陽的最熱的噴火口裏。」</p>
<p>「那，」女士中間之一說，「你怎麽知道太陽是熱的呢？」　　「問得怪呵！」克洛凱爾先生輕蔑似的說。「我感覺到他熱，我　知道的。」</p>
<p>「你感覺到胡椒是熱的，」那女士說，以與味回報着他的輕蔑。「但是你在這上而點不着一根火柴。」</p>
<p>「你感覺到鋼琴鍵盤右端的音高於左邊的音；可是這兩種音却都在同一的平面上。」又一個女士說。</p>

<p>熱河戰事當盡我人力抵抗</p>

<p>各國庚欵决繼續停付一年</p>
<p>代理行政院長宋子文、昨晨偕秘書黄純道、及張學良西顧問端納等、由京乘飛機抵滬、向金融界接洽華北財政問題、今晨十一時、宋氏在祁齊路寓次、接見各報社記者、發表重要談話、茲分述於次、</p>
<p>三代表辭職</p>
<p>記者首詢以今晨路透電傳、我國國聯代表顔惠慶·顧維鈞·郭泰祺·三氏、電京辭職、</p>
<p>究竟眞相如何、宋氏答稱、本人尙無所聞、擬即電外交部長羅文幹詢問眞相、</p>
<p>北上否未定</p>
<p>又詢以何日北上、據謂、本人北上與否、現尙未定、要當以將來事實上之需要爲標準、至本人此次來滬、（一）爲視察造幣廠開鑄新幣、（二）爲接洽財政上各事、</p>

<p>廢兩改元事</p>

<p>宋氏並稱、各國庚欵、决繼續停付一年、惟如美國部份、撥付清華學校經費、及中國文化敎育會基金、一如去年、雖然停付庚欵、仍舊續撥、至檢關日商拒絶繳納中國關稅、我方已提出嚴重抗議、向其交涉矣、</p>

<p>恭綽錢新之等赴碼頭歡迎</p>
<p>十日後北上參加抗日工作</p>
<p>行前將訪老友段祺瑞氏叙舊</p>
<p>前北京政府財政總長梁士詒氏、由香港乘大來公司柯立芝總統輪來滬、今晨八時半到滬、在新關碼頭登陸、據梁氏語新聲社記者、在滬逗留二十餘日、再北上參加抗日工作、世界第二次大戰、或有發生可能、但决非爲我國而起、國人依頼性成、實無異自殺政策、今後應全國團結一致、奮鬭到底、方可爭得最後之勝利云云、茲分記梁氏抵滬消息於後、</p>
<p>抵滬情形</p>
<p>柯立芝總統號輪、四時二十五分入口、六時泊楊樹浦十六號浮簡梁氏於八時三十分換乘小輪在新關碼頭登岸、同來者有岑學品等三人、赴碼頭歡迎者、有梁之親友葉恭綽·錢新之·鄭寳照·薩同生等四十餘人、梁衣紫醬緞皮袍、黑緞馬褂、鬚眉斑白、現年已六十有五、然精神矍鑠、毫無龍鍾之態、</p>
<p>參加抗日</p>

<p>童、亦應參加此種工作、本人離滬北上時、不擬入京作官、但參加政治工作、則係另一問題、固凡屬國民、均應瞭解、并過問國家之政治也、</p>
<p>世界大戰</p>
<p>梁氏繼謂、國際情勢、吾人無從過問、若欲預</p>
<p>聞、則必須先自忖力盡、否則何從問起、世界第二次大戰、或有發生之可能性、但此項戰事之發生、斷非因我國或中日問題而起、譬之二人在路中鬭毆、第三者參加、别抱有别種作用、國人之依頼性、無異自殺政策、欲求生存、非全國人人奮鬭則方可得最後之勝利也、</p>
<p>日如瘋犬</p>
<p>梁氏對日本之種種蠻而無理之侵略行爲、一如瘋狗、無批評之必要、無交涉之餘地彼即來犯、我則惟有抵抗而已、　　將晤段氏</p>
<p>梁氏又謂、梁與段祺瑞爲老友、故到滬後將往訪晤、惟日期未定本人寓港、除讀書外、即少出門、復少發言、胡漢民氏並未晤及、惟唐紹儀氏曾於年前一晤之、至粤方之商業情形、較前冷落、蓋係受世界經濟之影響云云、記者最後詢氏是否係張漢卿氏之電邀北上、氏極端否認、謂絶無此事</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>歲在癸酉，匈奴南征，佔天下第一關而屠朝陽，窥京津，欲據中原，似非亡中華而天下無以太平，舉國惶惶，莫敢禦宼，是時也，歐美列强，高瞻遠矚，不欲大好肥肉爲猛獸所獨呑，於是在發其「非天憫人」之宏願，口中念念有詞，集諸賢之哲理而成章，旣通過於十九委會，復通過於大會國聯，從此，我國之愛國志士，以及正人君子，莫不以手加額，融融乎而相慶曰，「正義幸伸，公理益彰，苟非吾人之力求精神抵抗，其可得如此偉大之勝利乎？」上下交稱賀，可知也。　　然而另一方面的松岡首席代表，却不能如此快樂，理由是国際的諸大老爺並不肯讓日本獨佔東北，要日軍仍然撤退到满鐡區内，而設立國際警察以維持中國領土之治安，於是日本帝國，不免面子掃地，於是松岡洋右不免「挾愁思失望」而離日内瓦矣。</p>
<p>但是我還記得，松岡在榮任首席代表之初，曾有以身殉國之决心，爲了證實我的記憶，還很健全，果然我在舊報紙堆中找着了如下的記載。</p>
<p>遠東社十八日大阪電，最近大阪每日新聞曾登松剛洋右在日内瓦奮鬥苦狀，謂松岡此次離國赴日内瓦時，其老母曾親贈日本刀一把，囑其爲國奮鬥，謂倘如在國聯外交失敗，則可將該力自裁，以顯掦大和民族之精神云，自國聯大會後，日本外交已漸陷入僵局，松岡每次回歸旅寓時常現悔喪之象，屢開盒注視其母所贈之刀而嘆，因此一班隨員均憂慮松岡將有自殺之舉動云。</p>
<p>照以上的記載看來，松岡理應遵其母命而「自裁，以顯掦大和民族之精神，」方不愧爲孝子烈士，但是他並不自殺，一班隨員也白自躭心，而只是「挾愁思及失望之情緖而去。」並且僅僅是聊以自解的說，「敬余不有東方人堅忍之氣槪，則余定將爲之痛哭，」似此，大和民族之精神，」不免爲之一厥不</p>
<p>振，嗚呼，苟余爲日人，「則余定將爲之痛哭。」</p>
<p>那末，松岡爲什麽還不自殺呢，當然他有他的理由，第一即暹羅國代表對於决議案放棄票權是也，」這一點？不免是他「所引爲欣慰者，」至少，他的外交還不曾完全失敗，所以還可以不必自殺，其二，列强决議之共管東北，並不敢明定日本除外，在「中國主權」的名義之下，日帝國主義仍可以張開其血盆大口，而將中國勞苦羣衆大批的吞噬，不過是不能獨飽罷了，是以松岡的外交，仍是成功，仍不致有辱君命，所以當然更可不必自殺。</p>
<p>這樣看來，松岡之不自殺，其理由仍是十足，而且中華民族亦决不會因其自殺面超脱殖民地之地位，所以我們大衆，只有自殺，武裝起來，在撤底的反帝國主義的民族革命戰爭中謀得自身的解放。</p>

<p>— 小夥子</p>
<p>在這樣一個大鑼大鼓熱閙有趣的「救國」年頭兒，救國的門路子，眞是多得一口氣背不完，你看，從「不抵抗救國」以至「航空救國」「馬逹救國」「經咒救國」「古物救國」「體育救國」「打機關槍救國」「玩考而夫救國」「嗎啡救國」「跳舞救國」「娱樂救國」「馬雀救國」「妓女救國」「茶花女救國」∶∶∶還有，還有就是前不久在報紙上駭然加了花邊刊着的香港陳碧雲女士的「玉容救國」，咦吁，背的太急而且快，好險給我小夥子氣噎住了·</p>
<p>當我在驚喜若狂及雀躍三百，駕跳五千中發現了這一「一九三三」式新名詞新門路「玉容救國」的時候，我的眼淚竟淌濕了一竹布大褂兒，朋友們詫異了，問我「這是打那裏説起呢，」我告诉他們「親愛的人兒啊，你們太可憐呀，怎的竞這般愚蠢，講給你吧，咱們的祖國從此又多得一救了!我的淚，這淚，正是快樂之淚呀，」於是，過了兩天，大槪又不只兩天吧，朋友們歡歡喜喜他捧了</p>
<p>「賡」先生的兩篇苦口婆心，菩萨肝腸，讚美及倡導這「一九三三」的「救國」新式門路的談話來唸給我聽，我閉上眼睛，拚息靜氣聽完之後，我拍掌踏脚而連聲幽揚地喊「痛快，痛快」的確，要不是我的嗎給我一副天生的大蔴皮，無論如何我當褲子帶也情願去沽上斤把鉛粉來給這「容」「玉」上一「玉」，因爲這是關係「救」咱們千瘡百孔的祖「國」的壯舉呀。然而，又有甚麽辦法呢，「大蔴皮救國」，在這年頭兒，也得行的通嗎，於是我倒有些憤憤然了。</p>
<p>究竟這態度是不對的，人家在埋頭抺面地「救國」，而自已不去找路子，却只是「憤憤然」，「憤」些甚麽，算了吧還是給這腦子冷靜一下，「消除成見」「共赴國難」，來把關於實行這新式「救國」的便利而獲效殊奇的方法來研究一下，於是經我三番五次的試騐與四趟七回的失敗，而結果終於很愉快地給我發現了天經地義的下列三條，朋友，你們是熱心救國的同志，来呀，齊心合力地來玩一下吧。</p>
<p>（一）無疑義的「玉容救國」，可以大大的歛一筆欵子，拿來買大综軍火槍械去給「義勇軍」打東洋人，但是丨我主張，先不忙拿這「歛着的」一筆在欵子去買</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>軍火槍械給「義勇軍」去打東洋人』，可以拿這欵子來做資未，大規模地設一所「玉容救國訓練所」，分速成及正科兩班，理由是藉此可以廣招人才，施以訓練，將來學成，可以成爲一個「玉容救國」的大集團，再由每個團員各自拿「玉容」去歛錢，則錢不是更多而軍火不是多得用不完嗎。　　（二）靑年男子當拿錢去給「玉容」的女人，而碰着家長的責備，或是道學先生申斥的時候，便應當拿這「救國」的强而有力的理由，并充分發揮，曉以大義，駡他三大聲不知亡國恨的猪仔。</p>
<p>（三）至於第三個法子，恕我在讀者尊前賣個小關子，諸位要知第三個法子究竟如何，且等到全體「義勇軍」由齊齊哈爾齊集湯姆斯克，再借道莫斯科而最後打到我們的上海，再行交代。</p>

<p>— 孫一鹤</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>謝謝你，請你代我解决一個困難問題吧！我是一爿帶些洋氣的國貨行家的職員。十年前，離學校，别雙親，到這爿行家做學徒。店裏的同事，都是本店學徒出身。我們的先生，也就是我們的老闆，他面子上待我们好極了；我們的月薪，踓說只有十元左右；但是倘使你不敷開支，每月借宕一二十元，他都能答允；有時我們家裏有了婚喪喜慶，向他商借二三百元，他也從未拒絶過。當時我們是何等感激呀！因此在這十年中，我就負了八百餘元的債，往後每年預算還是至少要負一百餘元呢！他在賬簿裏，一年一年的結欠，一年一年的增加；我們也竟視若無覩。</p>
<p>今年我找到了一個薪水较豐的位置，就向老闆情商，要求他許我辭職；不料他的回答，聽來很是仁至義盡，骨子裏，郤非常利害。他説「人望高山水望低，你現在有了高就，當然未便屈留；但是小號資本薄弱，一筆宕賬八百餘元，須得請你事前歸還。否則請你還是在這裏委屈幾時，因爲將欵子宕給一個不相干的人，這例子，是萬萬不能開的呀！」我至此就大覺大悟，原來他用的是「軟禁」法子呀！</p>
<p>編者先生，在這裏是一輩子無出息</p>
<p>了！但是要我先還宕賬，然後離職，我是無此力量。至於定做幾樁犯店規的事情，使他開口辭我；這種無恥的行爲，我又不屑嘗試。那未我有没有其他方法，衝破這「軟禁」的牢獄？（下略）</p>
<p>孫一鹤鞠躬</p>
<p>編者按：我們接到了孫君的來信，就同許多老於商塲的人討論；知道店主中採取這種「软禁」方法的，正大有人在。同時我們以爲這般店主，他們採取的方法，雖然差誤，但是他們的動機，郤不可抺煞。他們至少有「愛才」與「體恤」兩種美意。所以特地在這裏公開討論一下，希望有這種美意的店主們，别尋路徑。</p>
<p>店主對於得用的夥友，希望他久爲我用，不要帮了其他同業，來做我的勁敵，我們也不可厚非。不過籠絡的方法，必須要出之大方。要是你對於他們的待遇，能夠體貼入微，那末人非木石，當然會鞠躬盡瘁的。假使孫君的店主，能夠將宕給各　　的錢，明正言順的作爲薪水，算來孫君的月薪，除了起初學徒時代的三年以外，每月也可有三十元左右，我想孫君當然可以安然相處，不致再有見異思遷的念頭了。現在事實上他雖有三十元一月的進欵，但因爲名義上負了很大的債額，當然他心有不安，而亟謀别就。幸而孫君是一個講體面的人，所以不屑有意觸犯店規，否则你就悔亦無及矣。　　我們勸孫君须要體諒店主的美意，向老闆作一度的談判；將以前的薪水，追加若干，結定一個虧欠的數目；同時對於以後薪水，請他酌量增加，定一個分期拔還的方法。那么這樣一個體恤的舊主人，新主人未必能夠勝過，不妨將别就的念頭取消。要是他不能照辦，你儘可去而之他。好在這種宕賬，是他自願借與的欵子，非比私收客賬等欵，觸犯刑章。法律不外平人情，即使訴諸法庭，大不了也要打一個折扣，分期拔還罷了。</p>

<p>— ＥpＦalkowski著　志翔節譯</p>
<p>(五）</p>
<p>在星期一早晨，好似重載磚塊的車輛相互衝撞了發出的破碎的聲音，充满了全城。星期一，礦坑中的爆炸聲在山谷中回響着。星期一，驚醒了安眠在牀上的礦工：催促他們穿了膠皮鞋，向着礦坑中邁進着。</p>
<p>喝酒，吸烟，唱歌，星期六的晚上和星期日，奮鬥和希望，赚錢和化錢，在貧窮化的草屋中不斷的掙扎着，付房租，生小孩，工人在礦坑中壓死或受傷，老年礦工在礦坑中打算怎樣做工來謀生活丨所有一切的一切，都在星期一的早晨結束了，開始了。那可怕的礦廠的氣笛聲催促着無數的礦工將無價值的生命送進礦坑去。礦工掘着煤，用盡力氣地掘；經理祇希望獲得潤利，更多的潤利。</p>
<p>慘淡的星期一那天，工人們不許交談了，他們好似封閉了一般的不能講話。在報章上满載着不景氣的新聞丨市塲縮小了，可是經理和工頭們還是發狂似地要煤。那不祥的標題寫着：「不需要了」，已经使全部的煤業蕭條；而這種可怖的現象不斷地漫延着。裁减厰工的時期經到了：工人們因職業的不穩而懼怕，不知那天是他們最後工作的一天。　　但，迫切地採煤的工作，仍是邁進着；可惡的工頭發狂般的催促着工人在流汗中掘煤，而且更多要幾噸的煤。</p>
<p>十個可憐的工人，登着電梯，他們便覺得那寒風由下面的黑暗中送來。戰慄似的火燄由煤油燈中的伸出。他們静聽着流水的聲音，放置破碎機的房屋尖頂上，顯現一線蔚藍的天色，重霜遮蓋了軌道，炸藥房上不平坦的鐵板，油房和票房丨工人們到礦工作時查對號目的地方。沿着放置破碎機的斜屋頂上的霜，反映着亮光。緊張的静默，彌漫了全部。</p>
<p>彼特站在塗满了泥漿的電梯上。在戰慄的燈光下，看着同伴們削瘦而萎頓的臉。鈴響了，電梯急速的降下：一種尖鋭的聲音滾進耳鼓，同時頭腦也感到緊張了。鐵鏈聲，電梯和旁邊木條互相磨擦聲，陣陣地送入耳鼓，降下，下。直到那黑暗的危險境地；但，這裏埋藏着不可計數的寳物∶∶∶∶∶∶。</p>
<p>重載着煤的車輛在下面等候着。礦工們急急地衝過那激流所做成的幕帳，踏進了有臭味的坑道。冷酷的風由坑道的上面送來。彼特隨着一線澄光，循了那條難行的坑道前進着。一隻駕着車的老騾站在前面，旁邊站着一個臉上塗满了污泥的同伴，他正在嚼麵包。彼特再跑到了衹能一人獨行的小道上；從那裏走到另一條斜路時，一定要握緊着木樁。暗淡的石塊，被燈光將秘密洩露了而引起牠的盛怒似的常常地刺傷了工人的手；粗糙的木樁也常常地鈎住了工人的</p>
<p>衣服。無可形容的危險，在黑暗中步步地緊張着。黑暗有牠自已的生命丨牠有牠自已的惡夢，悲哀，歡笑，計劃；可怕的惡意及刻毒的感情；牠會甘言騙人，譏笑人，撫愛人；毒害人，毁滅人。他永還地靜默着，除了當零星石塊滾入</p>
<p>坑道中，或是炸藥爆發時，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Enemy Troops Deep into Jehol Province <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chaos in the Chifeng Area</p>
<p>Our Troops in Lingyuan Shorten Defense Lines</p>
<p>Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Tang Yulin All at the Front Lines</p>
<p>Sun Dianying Cables that Japanese Troops Have Reached Chifeng Territory</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Bomb Pingquan and Lingyuan Areas</p>
<p>Our Troops Build New Positions Based on the Heishan Ke Highlands</p>
<p>(Beiping) The battle in Jehol is urgent. Japanese troops are advancing rapidly and have already occupied half of Jehol's territory. Our troops are extremely indignant. In addition to Zhang departing for Jehol within the day to personally direct the battle, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Tang Yulin are now all at the front lines, directing the fighting. Morale is extremely high. Zhu Qinglan plans to go to Jehol immediately to command the various righteous armies to rise up against the enemy. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lingyuan Dispatch: Our troops are now building new positions based on the Heishan Ke highlands, taking a commanding position. The enemy has suffered numerous casualties on Shaomao Mountain and Laoye Temple. Japanese propaganda claiming to have captured Dachengzi is inaccurate. The enemy intends to attack through Mingshuitang Bianmen and Yaogou to cut off communication between Pingquan and Lingyuan. The Ding, Liu, and Zheng units are resisting desperately. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying is still commanding in Chifeng tonight. He cabled to Pingbao on the 1st, reporting that the enemy's cavalry, the Mogi unit, seized Sahuipo and Jianchangyingzi on the 1st before our troops could concentrate. A regiment was dispatched to advance rapidly. On the evening of the 1st, contact was made with the enemy at Huayuan. Our troops fought bravely and fiercely, repelling the enemy and regaining the Sahuipo position. Currently, our supplies are lacking, and we urgently hope for replenishment. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Jehol front line of our troops extends from Lindong in the north, through Chifeng, Jianping, Lingyuan, and Lingnan, to the east of Pingquan, forming an arc. Solid defenses have been set up based on natural barriers. The Japanese army is most concerned about Chifeng and Lingyuan. If Chifeng falls, the Japanese army can reach Chengde in one day. If Lingyuan falls, the Japanese army can threaten Jianping and Chifeng to the north and advance directly to Chengde via Pingquan to the south. As of this morning, the northern line of defense is still between Chifeng and Fangshen, jointly defended by the Sun Dianying and Feng Zhanhai units. The Cui Brigade is in a certain area north of Chifeng, harassing the enemy's rear in a certain area to the east. The Japanese army has not yet crossed Yebaishou and Taipingfang. The Dong Brigade is fighting in the Lingnan and Lingyuan areas, with Tang Yulin commanding there. The Japanese army in Lingnan is attacking the positions in three routes, in the Sanjianfang, Laoye Temple, and Mingshuitang Bianzuo areas. Our side, led by various brigades and the Zheng Guilin army, is responding. Wan Fulin is commanding in Pingquan, and Zhang Zuoxiang has arrived at the front to coordinate the military affairs of various units. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the enemy's Mogi unit and Matsuda unit have infiltrated five li into Chifeng County from Jianping, Tang Yulin launched a fierce attack on Chifeng from 9:00 PM last night. He has already turned from Lingyuan to Chifeng to supervise the battle. The Japanese Kurosawa and Matsuda units that infiltrated Chifeng are facing difficulties due to being isolated deep in the mountains, with the climate constantly at minus twenty degrees. Soldiers cannot eat the local sorghum rice, and military food is severely lacking, causing morale to plummet. The Japanese Kwantung Army headquarters urgently dispatched twelve merchant transport aircraft to transport rice, canned food, and other food supplies daily from the air to the front. However, this is just a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lingyuan Dispatch: The enemy's brigade Suzuki Unit, with approximately 6,000 soldiers, repeatedly attacked our Shaomao Mountain but was repelled. The enemy's Sokotani Unit, which attempted to steal through the Jiukou to cross Mingshuitangmen, was also repelled by our Ding Brigade at Shazishao. Our new positions in the Shaomao Mountain to Yaogou area are extremely solid. After 1:00 AM this morning, the Japanese army added the Kawano unit to attack our Yaogou area. Our Sun, Liu, and Ding Brigades are engaged in a fierce battle. The fighting is extremely intense. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lingyuan: The Japanese army advancing on Chengde from Lingyuan occupied Sidaoling at 4:30 PM this afternoon. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy forces attacking Yebaishou are the Hayakawa-Tomekawa Regiment, along with eight tanks and twelve armored vehicles, covered by twelve Japanese aircraft bombing. Our troops are being held by a certain brigade, waiting for the enemy to approach before using hand grenades to bomb them. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying cabled to Ping, stating that the Japanese army has reached Chifeng territory, only twenty li from Chifeng, to lure the enemy in deep for an encirclement and attack. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's main force has concentrated in Chifeng, reaching 20,000. Sun is currently stationed in Chifeng. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Official Chifeng Dispatch: After Sun Dianying personally inspected the front-line positions, morale was greatly boosted. However, due to the recent independent actions of a certain righteous army unit, our original defense plan has changed. Sun is personally supervising the construction of new positions. The Japanese army, with the Mogi Unit, Kurosawa Unit, and Matsuda Brigade as its main force, is hastily building positions twenty li north of Chifeng and began a fierce attack on us from 8:00 PM last night. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In Lingyuan, our main forces are the Yu and Wang Brigades. We have deployed five brigades between Lingyuan and Pingquan. We are determined to fight a final battle to defend Lingyuan. A certain unit is firmly defending Baishizhuimen, and a certain unit is firmly defending Shaomao Mountain. Now, the Sun Brigade is gathering towards Lingyuan, and the Ding Brigade is also retreating due to interrupted communication. In the Jianping area, in addition to a part of a certain brigade and the Security Team [unclear], Tang Yulin is personally commanding. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Dispatch: When enemy aircraft came this afternoon, the entire city sounded gongs and alarms, and the people fled into underground shelters. The enemy aircraft squadron has moved to Chaoyang, with approximately twenty aircraft. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Three Japanese aircraft flew to Chengde this morning for reconnaissance. We fired anti-aircraft guns, and the Japanese aircraft immediately flew away without dropping bombs. A large number of Japanese aircraft bombed the area between Pingquan and Lingyuan today. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It was widely rumored today that Song Ziwen would come to Beiping, and Zhang would personally go to the airport to welcome him. As a result, Song did not arrive. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the Lingnan front, because the Japanese Hattori Unit sent out a separate force, our position from Lingnan to Shaomao Mountain was cut off. We are now shortening the defensive line and concentrating forces to defend Lingnan. Last night, the Japanese army gathered behind Fangshen on the northern Chifeng front and then advanced towards the front of Chifeng. Japanese propaganda claims that they occupied the area at 11:00 AM this afternoon. We have no such report here. Sun Dianying still has reports on military affairs, but this afternoon, news from that area is extremely chaotic. We have telegraphed to inquire. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Zuoxiang Arrives at the Front to Supervise the Battle</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Dispatch: Zhang Zuoxiang arrived at the front with his entourage in several cars on the evening of the 1st, and is very busy investigating the military situation of various units. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Important Person Orders the Front to Hold Firm</p>
<p>(Beiping) A foreign reporter returned to Chengde from the front on the 1st. According to him, the Chinese army's positions and morale are good. If the units coordinate and material supplies are sufficient, the Japanese army may ultimately find it difficult to gain an advantage. The authorities here received a telegram from a certain important person ordering a firm defense of Chifeng and Lingyuan. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Attack Yebaishou Again</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lingyuan Dispatch: At 1:00 AM this morning, the Japanese army, under the cover of heavy artillery, attacked our Yebaishou again with infantry and cavalry units. Our army's positions were destroyed by Japanese aircraft and have been hastily rebuilt overnight. After 1:00 AM this morning, fierce fighting is taking place in Yebaishou. A strong unit of ours in Lingnan Shaomao Mountain crossed Gua Dahanhai at 3:00 AM this morning, attacking the enemy at Yebaishou in a pincer movement. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Kawahara Unit, with over 10,000 soldiers, attacked Yebaishou from Taipingfang yesterday, preparing to advance towards Lingyuan from there. A certain brigade has been ordered to draw forces from Lingnan to attack the Kawahara Unit. The main force of our Second Group Army has concentrated in a certain area. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Enemy Troops in Yebaishou City</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde Dispatch: At 10:00 AM this morning, Japanese aircraft flew to Lingyuan to drop bombs and explosions. Tang Yulin is currently inspecting defenses in Jianping. Twelve Japanese aircraft flew to Yebaishou yesterday, dropping over 400 bombs. Enemy troops were discovered in Yebaishou City last night and have made contact with our outposts. The fighting is fierce this morning. Over ten Japanese aircraft flew to Yebaishou again this morning to drop bombs. The entire town of Yebaishou has been turned into scorched earth. The Ningcheng Administrative Bureau has suffered slight losses. Our army's left flank is at Yaowang Temple, and the right flank is at Longjiaogou, all engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The Japanese attack on Lingnan has not been very successful. They have recently transferred the 39th Brigade of the 20th Division, a fresh force stationed in Pyongyang, Korea, which has opened up at Baishizhuimen from Suizhong and joined the general attack. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Our Front Line Wavering in Taipingfang</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: The Dong Unit stationed near Taipingfang wavered slightly in its lines due to intense fighting. The Japanese Kawahara Regiment, with 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers, took advantage of the gap and advanced around Yebaishou, heading straight for the north of Lingyuan. They were defeated by our army in Hetaogou. Subsequently, the Hattori Brigade of the Japanese army in Shaomao Mountain and other places advanced westward to reinforce, arriving at Dongfangshen, southeast of Lingyuan, this morning and making contact with the remnants of the Kawahara Unit, confronting our army on the west side of Lingyuan. At the same time, a part of the Hattori Unit opened fire and bombarded our positions east of Lingyuan, from morning till night, and are still engaged in intense fighting. However, the Japanese army has not been able to enter the city. Our formal positions are on the west side of Lingyuan. We have dispatched large forces to reinforce, and the situation in Lingyuan is very precarious. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>East Bank of the Shi River</p>
<p>Japanese Cavalry Provoking Constantly</p>
<p>Japanese Troops from Yuguan Transferred to Lingnan for Battle</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qinhuangdao Dispatch: Over 500 Japanese troops from Yuguan were transferred to Lingnan for battle yesterday.

<h3 id="e5">Commemoration of the Retreat from the Shanghai Battle <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Sui</p>
<p>Today marks the anniversary of the day our troops, who fought bitterly for over a month and repeatedly defeated powerful enemies, retreated completely from Shanghai. This retreat allowed the blood-red enemy flag to be planted all over Songhu, and the achievements of one month and two days of arduous resistance were swept away. We still remember this day last year. No matter who it was, upon hearing this news, almost everyone beat their chests and stamped their feet, grief-stricken and indignant. Now, a year has passed. We ask the people of the nation, how have you spent this painful year? What have we actually done in this year?</p>
<p>However, the reason why we are speaking with such grief is not to focus on the military victory or defeat. Victory and defeat are common occurrences for soldiers. Moreover, the enemy came with modern and up-to-date weaponry, with full preparation, and attacked with all its might. We, on the other hand, had simple equipment, outdated weapons, and yet we held on for over a month, repeatedly inflicting damage on the powerful enemy, forcing the enemy to change commanders three times, but they never succeeded. This kind of heroic resistance has, in any case, refreshed the eyes and ears of the international community and has forged an eternal and indelible glory in our nation's history. Although in the end, we withdrew tragically, allowing Songhu to be trampled by the enemy's iron hooves, this was also something we expected. There is no need for deep sighs of regret. What we believe is that the bloody battle of Shanghai has been over for a year now, and in this year, the enemy has gained ground inch by inch, and its arrogance has increased day by day. We, on the other hand, have been procrastinating and seeking temporary security, like a swallow building its nest on a flying curtain, unaware of the danger. The Shanghai battle agreement was signed, and those who sang and danced happily were just like they were in the past. The suffering and pain of this time last year were all thrown behind them. Jehol has the advantage of natural barriers. Why has there been no preparation in the past year? Now, it is in imminent danger and cannot survive the day. This kind of phenomenon is truly heartbreaking and leaves us helpless.</p>
<p>The revelation that the bloody battle of Shanghai gave us clearly shows that our country's army is not without the ability and determination to resist violence and defend itself. Looking at the bravery and composure of the soldiers in this bloody battle, their willingness to go to the enemy generously, and their disregard for death as if they were going home, and the fact that many cried to the sky on the day of the retreat, we can see that the soldiers all have the determination to die for the country.</p>
<p>The complete retreat on March 3, rather than saying it was due to the enemy being numerous and our forces being few and reinforcements being lacking, it is better to say that it was due to the lack of determination to resist throughout the country. Therefore, after more than a month of bloody battles, we ultimately lacked the strength to sustain it. This lack of determination to resist throughout the country has led to the ultimate failure of the anti-Japanese bloody battle of Shanghai. Today, regarding the matter of Jehol, according to our observations, if we mobilize the 400,000 heavy troops of North China and rely on the natural barriers that command a high position, and further supplement them with the spirit of the 19th Route Army's anti-Japanese resistance in Shanghai, then no matter how sharp the Japanese army's weapons are, it would at least be enough to sustain for three months. What will the result be now?</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan said in his memoir of the bloody battle of Shanghai: "The debt of our weakness is to be offset by a certain number of sacrifices. And now we have already paid some first. We just continue to work hard to pay it off completely. So, we don't need to be sad or sigh about previous events." Chen Mingshu also said: "If, because of the lessons of the Shanghai battle, China resolutely embarks on the road of anti-imperialism, then the Shanghai battle will be the clarion call for China's revival. If China still goes back, still returns to personal wars of contention for power and profit, then the Shanghai battle will be the death knell for China's destruction." In today's solemn commemoration, we have no other words. Please repeat the words of Weng and Chen to the people of the nation, and take this as a touchstone for the current anti-Japanese struggle in Jehol. Let the people of the nation think about it.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japan Annexes All Northeastern Railways of Our Country <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Existing Railways Generally Managed by the South Manchuria Railway Company</p>
<p>Another 100 Million Yuan to Build Three New Lines</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway Company and Puppet Organization Release Contract</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Manchukuo" has decided to entrust the management of state-owned railways to the South Manchuria Railway Company. A negotiation contract has been established, and its terms were announced yesterday by the Mantetsu. (2nd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army seized our state-owned railways by force. Under the management of the South Manchuria Railway Company, the profits made last year reached over 5 million yuan, making up for the years of deficits of the South Manchuria Railway Company, which is not a small amount. In order to permanently monopolize our railways, the Japanese government ordered the South Manchuria Railway Company to draft new treaties and forced the puppet Ministry of Transportation to sign them. This is the most important development after the signing of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. The general outline of its annexation treaty is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The South Manchuria Railway Company, entrusted by "Manchukuo," manages all of its state-owned railways. In order to unify the existing basic railways, adopt reasonable management methods, and increase economic and technical benefits, it is most appropriate for all railways to be managed by the South Manchuria Railway Company, which has sound experience and technology. Because "Manchukuo" owes the company a huge debt, in order to handle the debt relationship, it was decided to accept all management rights of the railway.</p>
<p>(B) The general outline of the management contract is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The "Manchukuo" government owes the South Manchuria Railway Company a total of 133 million yuan for the Jichang, Jitun, Jihui, Sitao, Taosuo, Qike, Huhai, Shenhai, and Fengshan railways. Therefore, the property and income of the above railways are mortgaged for this loan, and all management rights are transferred to the Mantetsu. (2) The "Manchukuo" 's debts and credits for railway funds to third countries shall be handled by the South Manchuria Railway Company in consultation with "Manchukuo." The debts to be repaid shall be handled by the South Manchuria Railway Company. The loan from the Sino-British Company shall be repaid from the revenue of the entrusted railway. The portion of the Fengshan Road related to the loan from the Sino-British Company shall be removed from the mortgage until this loan is resolved. (3) "Manchukuo" allows the Mantetsu to construct the "from Dunhua to Tumenjiang," "Laha to Harbin," and "Dedu to Hailin" lines, with an estimated cost of 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>(C) In order to construct the above three railways, "Manchukuo" should borrow 6 million yuan from the South Manchuria Railway Company to purchase the Tientu Railway, and then entrust the Mantetsu to manage it. (2nd Hualian News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Second Step of Action Will Still Be Hosted by the League of Nations</p>
<p>France's Attitude Is Also Awaiting International Agreement</p>
<p>(London) Today's Cabinet meeting will re-consider the Far East dispute. Regarding the arms embargo case between China and Japan, it will continue to exchange views with various countries, but the second step of action will be hosted by Geneva. This afternoon, Chen Weicheng, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in the UK, went to the British Foreign Office to convey the Chinese government's views on the British arms embargo case to the British government. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies convened a meeting today. When Foreign Minister Pengu gave a speech at the meeting on French foreign policy, he briefly mentioned the Sino-Japanese dispute. Pengu said frankly that unless various countries agree on a common attitude towards the ban on arms shipments to the Far East, it is difficult for France to make a decision. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Guelle, a member of the Chamber of Deputies from the department of Allier, submitted a motion requesting that the French government immediately negotiate with various countries to stipulate internationally that when disputes occur between countries, they should be submitted to the League of Nations for review in accordance with Articles 12 and 15 of the Covenant. If the disputing country refuses to comply with the recommendations made by the League of Nations, all countries should prohibit the shipment of arms to that country. The motion also requests the government to take necessary measures after diplomatic negotiations are settled to ensure that this ban is enforced within the entire territory of France. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) A Liberal Party member, Mandel, has raised an inquiry in the House of Commons, stating that the League of Nations General Assembly unanimously recommended on October 4, 1931, the withdrawal of ambassadors and ministers from Tokyo as a possible solution. He asked the government to respond to whether various countries have considered simultaneously recalling diplomatic representatives stationed in Japan. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Radical Party held a general meeting. The party leader and former Prime Minister Herriot declared, "In recent weeks, the international situation has become increasingly serious, which means that Japan and the League of Nations have broken up. No one feels more uneasy about this matter than France. Japan provided assistance to the Allied countries in the European War. Its organizational ability and its efforts towards civilization cannot be forgotten by us. However, we French people are believers in republicanism and ultimately believe that the principle of 'respecting international treaties and the League of Nations Covenant' must be maintained. If this main principle is also overturned, then the policy we pursue, as well as the main principle, and the connection between our rights and our hopes, will all be overturned." (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The famous British political critic Stide told a Reuters reporter today that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese dispute, Britain and France should have declared to China and Japan through the League of Nations or other agencies that any method of acting unilaterally is contrary to the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Pact of Paris. Any country that does not comply with various obligations will find itself on the wrong path and incur effective international condemnation. Unfortunately, Britain and France did not do this, which is a fundamental error in British and French policy. Since Britain and France did not implement this policy, the Japanese nationalist faction and warlords became arrogant, eventually leading to the assassination of moderate politicians and intimidating those who favor peace. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Japan has purchased another five transport ships from the UK this week. The names of the five ships are Panza Dada, Ikelite, Canadian Cavalry, Moerk, and Witimin Da. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese representative Matsuoka told a reporter from the Daily Mail today that Japan is fighting solely for peace in the Far East and respect for treaties, and that a final peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute cannot be achieved until the entire China problem is resolved. Although the Lytton Report advocates the establishment of a strong Chinese government under international administration, in his view, this is very difficult. Few countries are willing to take this responsibility, and the Chinese will certainly not accept international co-management. He earnestly asked the Chinese representative in Geneva whether China could accept international co-management, but the Chinese representative remained silent. If the Chinese representative were forced to answer, he would definitely refuse. Matsuoka also said that Japan must deal with anyone who hinders the independence of "Manchukuo."

<p>(New York) It seems that only the scrap steel buying and selling industry is seriously considering the impact of an arms embargo on the Far East. According to the Iron Age magazine published today, nearly 40 percent of the scrap steel exported by the United States is sold to the Japanese. If the ban is strictly enforced, the industry will suffer greatly. (1st National Telegram)</p>

At this time, our country should urgently recall its ambassador to Japan to firmly express our position. As for invoking Article 16 of the Covenant, both the government and the people of our country should prepare for the greatest sacrifices. This matter does not only concern the relationship between our country and Japan, but all nations must also sever all commercial and economic ties with Japan. In our country, both the government and the people should sever all ties with Japan. Japan needs our raw materials and will suffer significant losses. Regarding the Jehol war, whether it be old or new defense lines, I hope we will resist and never retreat without a fight. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) - A person in charge of the Ministry of Industry stated that the ministry has telegraphed the Russian authorities to inquire whether they would welcome and receive the delegation.

Approximately 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per person would be sufficient; otherwise, it would require more than 10,000 yuan. The delegation will mainly consist of representatives from industrial and commercial groups, with the ministry playing a guiding role. Our ambassador to Russia, Yan Huiqing, has already departed to take office in Russia, and the ministry has instructed Yan to expedite this matter.

<p>(Nanjing) - Regarding the issue of the Ministry of Judicial Administration's subordination, according to Liang Hancao, the case involves changing the National Government Organization Law, and the Legislative Yuan will carefully review it. Currently, opinions are divided. Some advocate that it should still be under the Executive Yuan, because the functions of judicial administration are to handle administrative matters in the judicial field. Others advocate that it should be changed to be under the Judicial Yuan, because according to the meaning of the five-power separation, the functions of the judiciary should be absolutely independent. If the ministry is considered an administrative agency, then the administrative agencies of other Yuan have not been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. In terms of advantages and disadvantages, it is irrelevant. I personally have no fixed opinion on this and should wait for the detailed research of the various committees of our Yuan, so as to make it suitable for a reasonable government organization and not violate the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings.

<p>Congress to convene special session</p>
<p>The surging tide threatens to engulf the Golden State</p>
<p>Roosevelt consults with new Treasury Secretary on measures</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st – The banking crisis and financial situation in the United States has become the most important issue at present. Close associates of the new President Roosevelt have indicated that a special session of Congress will be convened on March 20th. Roosevelt himself met with the new Treasury Secretary Woodin in New York today to discuss urgent measures to stabilize national confidence. In Congress, a bankruptcy bill was passed by a vote of 207 to 26 and sent to the President for signature. The bill allows debtors to apply to the court for a delay in debt repayment to avoid bankruptcy. As for the financial sector, the crisis continues unabated. Even in the Capital District (i.e., the District of Columbia), several banks have restricted withdrawals. Banks in Tennessee and Kentucky have voluntarily closed for five days to discuss effective measures to restrict withdrawals. The legislatures of New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia have all passed new laws, with the first two states strictly restricting withdrawals and the latter state authorizing the state government to order banks to close when necessary. Larger banks in Washington are still operating normally and have not experienced difficulties.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 2nd – The financial crisis is spreading and showing no signs of abating. In addition to the voluntary closures of banks in Tennessee and Kentucky, governors in four more states have ordered closures. Banks in California, Oklahoma, and Louisiana have closed for three days each, while Mississippi has closed for ten days. State legislatures are drafting emergency legislation to seek relief. However, this move is largely driven by depositors' panic. The fundamentals of the banks are actually sound. However, at a time when the crisis is raging, government declarations and police warnings cannot stop depositors from withdrawing their funds. Therefore, experienced bankers here believe that the only way to provide emergency relief is to restrict withdrawals until the crisis subsides. It has been reported from Detroit that after a New York bank refused Ford's loan, the First National Bank of that city has rejected Ford's reorganization plan and will continue to operate as before with the current withdrawal restrictions. However, Ford is currently organizing a National Manufacturers Bank to take over the assets of the United Guardian Trust Company.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 1st – The developments in the American banking situation over the past 24 hours are still within expectations, as it is known that the unsettled situation will continue to spread. The governor of Alabama has declared a ten-day bank holiday. At the same time, Tennessee and Kentucky have also declared holidays, but these holidays are not mandatory, and many banks in the two states remain open. Four banks in Philadelphia have restricted withdrawals, and a bank in Washington only allows withdrawals of 5% of deposits. Three banks in East St. Louis are also doing the same, with total deposits of 11 million yuan. Small banks in Detroit, Baltimore, and Cleveland have closed, preparing to withdraw large sums of money from the Federal Reserve Bank to meet withdrawals. At the same time, the Reserve Bank also has to deal with a large number of commercial paper discounts, which has led to rumors that the Reserve Bank is being withdrawn. Officials immediately denied this rumor. The interest rate on bank acceptances has risen from 1.25% to 2.25% today. A key figure in New York banking circles stated that New York banks have remitted 500 million yuan in recent weeks to support their correspondent banks and are continuing to do so. New York banks can easily pay depositors' withdrawals, as their average liquidity is about 80%, consisting of cash and readily convertible paper. U.S. government bonds are relatively stable, because banks do not sell the bonds on the market, but hold them to borrow cash from the Reserve Bank. The twenty largest banks in New York currently hold about 450 million yuan in government bonds.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Tens of Thousands Expected to Watch Roosevelt's Inauguration Tomorrow <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st – It is estimated that 200,000 people, including residents of the capital and visitors from all over the country, will attend President Roosevelt's inauguration on Saturday. At least 50,000 of them will be able to witness the new President's inauguration in front of the Capitol, while the rest will gather along Pennsylvania Avenue to watch the new President lead his entourage back to the White House after the inauguration. Representatives from all over the country have already set out, either by car or by special train. The southern states have always supported the Democratic Party, so they have sent many representatives. The western states also supported Roosevelt this time, so their representatives are expected to be numerous as well. The program for the inauguration ceremony has been announced today. It is scheduled that the new President Roosevelt, accompanied by his wife, will arrive at the White House at 11 a.m. on Saturday. He will then travel by car with the outgoing President Hoover, his wife, and several members of Congress to the Capitol. The two Presidents will personally watch Vice President Garner, new Senators, and new Cabinet members take their oaths of office at noon. At 12:50 p.m., President Roosevelt will go to the east side of the Capitol to take his oath of office and deliver his inaugural address. At this time, the army and navy will be lined up on the parade ground, ready for inspection. After the new President holds a luncheon banquet for over 300 guests, he will travel by car to the parade ground near the White House to conduct the inspection. After the formal ceremonies are completed, there will be social celebrations and banquets. The new President and his wife will hold a tea party at the White House to receive 1,500 guests. In the evening, they will host a banquet for 60 distinguished guests at the White House. In addition, the Washington Auditorium will hold a presidential inaugural ball at 10 p.m. As for the outgoing President Hoover, he will quietly leave the Capitol after the new President takes his oath of office and is expected to return to his home in California by car in the evening. There are no special ceremonies regarding the outgoing President.</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 1st – The Council of the League of Nations met tonight for two and a half hours to consider the report of the three-member committee on the Leticia dispute between Peru and Colombia. The committee recommended that Peruvian troops withdraw from the territory and that the League of Nations organize a committee to take over the territory, with Colombian troops maintaining order. However, these troops must be international in nature. The committee believes this is a prerequisite for resolving the dispute. The Colombian representative stated on the spot that he accepted the report and asked Peru to also accept the mediation process, otherwise Peru would be adversely affected under Article 15 of the Covenant. The Council has now authorized the three-member committee to begin drafting a report. Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative, supported the committee's report and urged both sides to accept it in order to establish a precedent in this turbulent world to maintain peace. The Peruvian representative gave a long speech, comparing the Peruvians to the Japanese, saying that Peru was also moved by the spirit of loyalty to the country and willingness to sacrifice. He also said that Peru upheld the dignity of international obligations and respected treaties, but there was a distinction between honorable and dishonorable treaties, and that all dishonorable treaties should be destroyed. The Peruvian representative then requested a few days of hesitation so that the Peruvian government could consider a reply. Representatives from thirteen countries attended today's Council meeting. The Japanese representative was absent. The chairman did not comment on the matter.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 1st – According to news from here today, the war debt negotiations between the UK and the US in Washington must be delayed until April or later. Originally, it was thought that the representatives of both countries could open talks in Washington after Roosevelt took office as President on March 4th. Now, given the many pending matters for the new government, the date of the opening talks has to be postponed. The question of who will be the British representative at the time of the negotiations is also related to the postponement of the opening talks, because the British Finance Minister Chamberlain, who is directly related to the war debt, will be constrained by the budget in April and may not be able to leave the UK.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 1st – The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference made an important resolution at its meeting today: all professional armies whose service years are longer than the militia, except for the troops needed for joint military actions by the League of Nations, must be prohibited. Germany is paying close attention to this, because according to this resolution, if Germany adopts the militia system, then the national defense force will no longer exist.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 1st – The Aviation Committee of the Disarmament Conference today passed a motion clearly stipulating that the committee's work is based entirely on the assumption of the complete abolition of the army, navy, air force, and anti-aircraft. It is expected that after this resolution, Germany will be able to participate in the discussions of the Aviation Committee in the future. The general opinion on the issue of the internationalization of the Air Police Force is conditioned on the acceptance of the complete abolition of the army, navy, and air force. Indian representative Wheeler claimed that he anticipated serious difficulties in internationalizing the aviation industry within India and between India and England. (Geneva) The Japanese representative to Switzerland, Yada, met with the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, this afternoon and informed him that the Japanese government had decided to continue to participate in the work of the Disarmament Conference.

<p>(Reuters, London Correspondence) – A new type of aircraft will soon appear on the market. The aircraft is propelled by a six-horsepower engine and is very easy to drive and very safe, so it can also be called an "aerial motorcycle." Ten years ago, Linpu had tried it, but the basic structure of the machine focused on achieving rapid and durable flight with very little horsepower. The new aircraft has a maximum speed of 50 miles per hour and a gliding speed of 18 miles per hour, just like a "small car" among aircraft. This type of aircraft is ideal for recreation in good weather, and the value of each aircraft is about 250 pounds.</p>

<p>Reuters Reporter Inspects Rehe</p>
<p>Foreigners Claim Chinese Troops Defend Natural Defenses</p>
<p>Gubeikou Communication, 27th – Although the situation outside the pass is unknown, the ice and snow inside the pass have begun to melt. A Reuters reporter rode to Chengde and did not see any signs of war along the way. It was not until Miyun that he saw troops. The [illegible] Division is stationed in the area between Miyun and Gubeikou. Livestock used for military transportation, such as mules, horses, and camels, are everywhere and seem to be sufficient. The food stored along the way is also very abundant. The reporter asked the villagers about the war and what they thought. They all stared blankly and did not know how to respond, saying that they had not heard of any war. The morale of the troops is excellent, and they are well-fed, well-clothed, and have sufficient ammunition. Their discipline is also good. They pay generously for food and other items purchased from villagers along the way and are courteous to travelers. On the way to Gubeikou, he saw a large group of camels transporting ammunition to Rehe. The reporter met several foreign travelers returning from Rehe in Gubeikou. One of them claimed that the areas defended by Zhang Xueliang's troops are all natural defenses. If the supply of ammunition is uninterrupted and there is a determination to resist the enemy, they may not be able to hold out for long, but they can last for a long time. (Reuters)</p>

<p>Report from the Customs Officer of Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Maze, Inspector General of Customs, stated that several days ago, according to a telegram from the customs officer of Qinhuangdao, Japanese merchants in Yuguan have refused to comply with the regulations and declare and pay taxes at Chinese customs since February 4th. After several weeks, a serious protest was lodged with the Japanese Consul in Tianjin. It has been found that the Yuguan Customs branch is located within the Great Wall and is still under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. The customs duties collected by the branch, like the taxes collected at other treaty ports, are used in accordance with the treaty as security for the debt repayments to various countries. Japan is also one of the creditors of the debt repayments. The merchants of that country have violated the treaty, and if this behavior is not strictly corrected, the integrity and status of the customs, in which all countries have an interest, will inevitably be affected.

<p>Substituting for Song Ziwen in慰勞ing the Frontline Soldiers</p>
<p>Although the Soldiers Endured Hardship, They Were Extremely Brave</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Liu Chongjie, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Shang Zhen departed from Beiping on the Beining Special Train at 1:00 AM on the 25th to慰勞 the frontline soldiers at Shihe. After completing their mission on the evening of the 26th, they took a train from Qinhuangdao back west and arrived in Beiping at 10:10 AM on the 27th. That afternoon at 4:00 PM, they met with reporters at the Foreign Affairs Building to discuss the situation. The details are recorded as follows: "President Song previously came to Beiping and went to Rehe to慰勞 the soldiers. For the Shihe front, he dispatched me to represent him in慰勞ing and inspecting. I, along with Chief Commander Shang, left Beiping at 1:00 AM on Friday night and first arrived at certain locations to慰勞 the troops under Chief Commander Shang. Then, I went to various frontline locations in the defense area of Army Commander He Zhuguo to慰勞 and inspect the defense work. The weather on the front line is still cold, but the morale is high. Although they endure hardship, everyone is united, and their bravery has not diminished. They are ready to fight the enemy when they can no longer bear it. Every soldier has this determination. Although we are not as well-equipped as the enemy in terms of weapons and supplies, our spirit is far superior to theirs. I met with Regiment Commander Shi Shian and inquired about the situation during the Yuguan Incident. The enemy's provocation was obvious. If the enemy had not climbed the city walls, we would not have been able to defend ourselves. This is a past matter, and there is no need to elaborate further. In addition, I also explained the situation of the League of Nations to the frontline soldiers, saying that only with a spirit of sacrifice can one obtain justice. They understand this quite well. Army Commander He Zhuguo expressed an even stronger determination to resist the enemy. In short, during this inspection, I deeply respected the frontline soldiers. The people in the rear should also have the spirit of enduring hardship and hunger of the frontline soldiers and dedicate themselves to assisting the front. If the front falls, the rear must continue the fight. There has been no fighting on the front line recently. Yesterday (the 26th), five Japanese warships were docked in Qinhuangdao, including two cruisers and three destroyers. In the Yuguan area, the enemy is constantly preparing. If we do not fight desperately in the future, there will be no way out. Currently, Rehe is in an emergency. Everyone should not only focus on Rehe but also remember the Shihe front. The invisible urgency there is similar to that in Rehe. I will leave Beiping in the next few days to return south. I plan to first go to Nanjing to report to President Song and Minister Luo and then decide on my future actions. If necessary, I may come north again." When reporters asked about the truth of the Japanese propaganda regarding the discovery of Chinese military aircraft in Shanhaiguan and how diplomatic relations would be handled if the enemy threatened Beiping and Tianjin, he replied, "The Japanese claim about the discovery of aircraft in Shanhaiguan is, of course, another propaganda tactic, which is easy to understand. At present, we can only wait for their aircraft and artillery to come and fight them. The Yuguan Incident has already violated the Boxer Protocol. If they threaten Beiping and Tianjin in the future, we can only defend our territory and, at the same time, notify the signatory countries of the Boxer Protocol and ask them to fulfill their treaty obligations."

The members are Yang Zaichun, Chen Daxun, and Wu Guozhen. The Secretary-General is Jiang Youwen. They were sworn into office at the same time. Zhu Shaoliang was sent by the Central Government, and Zhong Yancheng was sent by the Executive Yuan of the National Government to supervise the oath-taking. Many guests attended the ceremony, including Cao Haosen, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, and Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General. The meeting opened at 10:00 AM. After Chairman Xia Douyin performed the ceremony, Zhu Shaoliang presented the seals of office. Xia and the four department directors, Li, Jia, Li, and Cheng, each received their seals of office separately. After all the members took the oath, Zhu Shaoliang delivered a speech, stating that Hubei Province had suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities for many years, and the people were suffering greatly, like a patient with a disease that had penetrated deep into the marrow. The members were like doctors who had come to treat the disease, but a good doctor must first investigate the source of the disease before prescribing the right medicine. The source of Hubei's disease was not only caused by bandits, but also by widespread corruption and the failure to focus on fundamental education. In the future, in order to restore order, it is necessary to provide relief to the unemployed, improve education, ensure that reality matches reputation, and cultivate integrity. As the saying goes, "Governance does not lie in many words but in vigorous action." He hoped that all members would work hard. Then, Shi Yancheng delivered a speech, stating that when the Commander-in-Chief was in Hubei, he stipulated that three parts of military force and seven parts of political force should be used to eliminate the Red bandits. Now, the military suppression of bandits has come to an end, and he hoped that all members would work hard to complete the political construction. Next, Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Headquarters, Yu Yuzhi, member of the Provincial Party Department, Fang Benren, a gentry, and He Hengfu, a representative of the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, delivered speeches successively. Finally, Xia Douyin delivered a reply, stating that Hubei is located in the center of the country, controls the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and has suffered frequent disasters, leading to a decline in vitality. Recently, due to the outbreak of the war in Rehe, foreign troubles are becoming more urgent. The provincial government has a heavy responsibility and is not something that his colleagues can handle alone. However, driven by a sense of responsibility, he cannot but bravely accept the arduous task. In addition to following the instructions of the Central Government and respecting the leadership of the Commander-in-Chief in eliminating corruption and diligently seeking the welfare of the people, he also hopes that the elders of the local community will cooperate to adapt to this severe situation. After Xia finished speaking, music was played, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>On the 1st, the four departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, and education simultaneously dispatched personnel to take over. Li Shucheng, Jia Shiyi, Li Fanyi, and Cheng Tianfang all went to their respective departments to take office. They gathered all the staff for a speech and announced the appointment of important officials. Wang Shiyu and Zhu Yizhou were appointed as secretaries of the Department of Civil Affairs; Xiong Daorui, Jiang Jie, and Peng Guangxuan were appointed as assistant secretaries; Fan Hongtai, Hu Zhongmin, Wang Kaihua, and Cheng Hongshu were appointed as section chiefs. Wu Longxun was appointed as the secretary-general of the Department of Finance; Wang Ruyi was appointed as the secretary; Ren Chaowen, Xue Guangxun, He Xizhang, and Gui Jingqiu were appointed as section chiefs. It is said that more than 80 people were laid off. Qiu Zhize was appointed as the secretary and acting chief of the first section of the Department of Construction; Chen Cong was appointed as the technician and acting chief of the second section; Lu Bo was appointed as the secretary and acting chief of the third section; Zhang Yanxiang was appointed as the technician and acting chief of the fourth section. Chen Yingkun and Fang Shanzheng were appointed as secretaries of the Department of Education; Deng Bixing, Chen Jitang, and Wang Dexi were appointed as section chiefs. Li Shucheng stated that the most important tasks of the Department of Civil Affairs are to improve county governments, strengthen personnel, and conduct land surveys. There are many other matters to be handled, and he will strive to implement them in accordance with the laws and regulations of the headquarters. Jia Shiyi stated that Hubei's finances have no source to open up, and reductions have already been implemented. In the future, the main goal will be to maintain the status quo and gradually reorganize. The business tax issue is consistent nationwide, and Hubei cannot be unique. He plans to thoroughly rectify it. Cheng Tianfang stated that Hubei's education funding is extremely difficult. Since the reduction, it has been barely able to support itself. During this time of national crisis, we should still strive to be thrifty.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the new provincial government, a telegram was sent to the Central Government, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan for record, and a telegram was sent to all parties, stating, "According to the order of the National Government, Xia Douyin, Li Shucheng, Jia Shiyi, Li Fanyi, Cheng Tianfang, Fan Xiji, Yang Zaichun, Chen Daxun, and Wu Guozhen are appointed as members of the Hubei Provincial Government, and Xia Douyin is appointed as the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Li Shucheng is appointed as the director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the Hubei Provincial Government, Jia Shiyi is appointed as the director of the Department of Finance of the Hubei Provincial Government, Li Fanyi is appointed as the director of the Department of Construction of the Hubei Provincial Government, and Cheng Tianfang is appointed as the director of the Department of Education of the Hubei Provincial Government. Following this order, we were sworn into office on March 1st. Hubei is located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the safety of the entire country depends on it. Frequent disasters have left wounds unhealed, and the national crisis is deepening, and the Red atmosphere needs to be quelled. Douyin and others have wrongly accepted the heavy responsibility and are deeply ashamed of their meager talents. We are alarmed by the great difficulties ahead and are constantly cautious. We hope that the grand plans will be far-reaching and that instructions will be frequently issued so that we can follow them and avoid failure. We hereby send a telegram for your information. Respectfully awaiting your instructions. Xia Douyin, Li Shucheng, Jia Shiyi, Cheng Tianfang, Fan Xiji, Yang Zaichun, Chen Daxun, Wu Guozhen bow to the east." However, member Fan Xiji was still supervising the suppression of bandits in western Hubei, so he did not participate in the inauguration of the other members and will be sworn in after his triumphant return. (March 1st)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Executives Retain Chairman</p>
<p>Cai Guangyao, the chairman of the county chamber of commerce, concurrently holds many positions in local public organizations, and his duties are numerous and busy. Recently, feeling that he is unable to cope with the demands of his age, he invited the standing committee members of the chamber of commerce and local officials and leaders the other day, stating that he would resign from all his positions. Although they unanimously persuaded him to stay at the time, his attitude was extremely firm. He transferred the chamber of commerce funds and documents to the standing committee members for receipt. Today (the 2nd) at 1:00 PM, the county chamber of commerce convened a joint meeting of executives and supervisors, and unanimously voted to retain the chairman. Zhang Mengxing, Zhang Qingquan, Zhu Yian, and four others were elected as representatives to visit and persuade him to stay. It was also resolved to telegraph the central government not to renew the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Tariff Treaty and to vigorously resist Japanese goods in order to demonstrate public sentiment.</p>
<p>Property Management Office Requests Reduction of Additional Grain Taxes Again</p>
<p>The County Property Management Office previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the penalty for late payment of winter grain taxes this year be reduced by two yuan in additional grain taxes to alleviate the people's difficulties, which was indeed a matter of compassion. Later, it received a reply from the Ministry, instructing the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to make earnest corrections. Recently, because the Finance Bureau still calculates the arrearage at 7 yuan and 9 jiao of silver per shi (unit of dry measure), including a 2-yuan arrearage penalty, the office telegraphed the Ministry again yesterday, requesting that the Department of Finance be instructed to order the Finance Bureau to correct it immediately to benefit the people and demonstrate great integrity.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Exhibition of Anti-Japanese War Relics Opens</p>
<p>Last year, during the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, this county was bombed by Japanese aircraft. A year has passed, and the Japanese invaders have invaded Rehe again. In order to arouse the public to unite against Japan, the Public Education Center held an exhibition of relics from the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai starting on the 1st. In addition to borrowing military supplies seized from the Japanese army during the war from the Public Education Center in Shanghai and the March 1st Museum in Taicang, the county party headquarters and chamber of commerce also sent various types of Japanese artillery shells and superstitious objects to be displayed in the hall of the center. From morning to night, visitors streamed in an endless flow. The exhibition will last for five days.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob Dashu Town</p>
<p>Dashu Town in the county is located in a remote area and is often disturbed by lake bandits. Last month, a large gang of lake bandits arrived there and stayed for a while, but fortunately, they did not rob anyone. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, another bandit ship arrived there, with more than a dozen bandits on board, each armed with guns. After landing, they first cut the telephone lines, then searched door to door. After an hour, no shop or household in the whole town was spared. The bandits boarded their ship after robbing and left with a roar. Afterwards, the town chief, Ren Yi, reported to the Zhangpu Public Security Branch, which reported to the county government for strict investigation.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Criminals Involved in Opium Seizure Case</p>
<p>Transferred to Jiangsu High Court for Trial</p>
<p>Zhang Shaoyi, the director of the stolen goods section of the third section of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, seized a large amount of opium. After being discovered by Mayor Wu, he was sent to the Shanghai Court, which sentenced Zhang to four years and six months in prison and fined him 2,000 yuan. Police officer Wu Deyu and bailiff Ji Asi were declared innocent. Zhang refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The prosecutor in the original trial also refused to accept the acquittal of Wu and Ji and filed an appeal. Yesterday (the 2nd), the Shanghai Court transferred Zhang, Wu, Ji, and the entire case file to the Jiangsu High Court and sent them to prison for custody, with a hearing scheduled.</p>
<p>A Series of Instructions from the High Court</p>
<p>The High Court issued the following instructions yesterday: (1) All county courts should uniformly produce tables of suspects and prisoners.

<p>Record of Party-Government Talks</p>
<p>The county party headquarters held its fifth party-government talks yesterday, chaired by Li Tiping. Matters discussed: (1) A letter from the Special Party Department of the 88th Division of the Army stated that Japanese people have established large-scale grain storage facilities in major ports in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou to purchase Chinese grain and that strict prevention should be enforced to prevent theft and leakage. How should this case be handled? Resolution: (A) It is recommended to the province that it quickly formulate preventive measures to prevent smuggling. (B) Local water and land military police should strictly prevent smuggling at all times. (2) The provincial party headquarters forwarded four types of methods for setting up radios in various places and ordered them to be followed. How should this case be handled?

(Omissions)</p>
<p>Yarn Industry Funds Used to Purchase Aircraft</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th Incident" two years ago, the dyeing and weaving industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been actively resisting foreign yarn and striving to develop self-spun fine yarn. For each piece of yarn used, a yarn industry fund must be collected. The accumulated amount has now reached more than 90,000 yuan. Yesterday, the Wuxi Cloth Factory Guild telegraphed the standing committee members of the Shanghai Jiangsu-Zhejiang Dyeing and Weaving Industry Federation, Zhu Wenqi and Cui Fuzhuang, requesting that relevant industries in the two provinces be convened immediately to use this money to purchase an aircraft, which would be named the "Jiangsu-Zhejiang Dyeing and Weaving Aircraft" to promote the industry. At the same time, telegraphs were sent to the same industries in Wujin, Changshu, Wuxian, and other places, unanimously advocating the plan. In addition, the county party headquarters, together with the county government and the county chamber of commerce, discussed and resolved the aviation patriotic promotion method, and a board of directors was established as soon as possible to carry out fundraising for aviation patriotic funds in earnest.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>County Government Dispatches Personnel to Take Over the Construction Bureau</p>
<p>The Wuyi Construction Bureau was ordered to be abolished, and all its undertakings were taken over by the county government, which established a section to continue handling them. After receiving the order, the bureau closed everything and handed it over yesterday (the 1st). County Chief Zhang specially dispatched Qian Tangxin and Wang Maoxin to take over. At the same time, the personnel of the county government's technical office were announced, including Xu Jiamo, the director of the technical office, Xiang Jie, Zhu Fuyuan, and Ni Liang, technicians, and Li Wenxue and Su Liusheng, clerks, who were all reappointed from the original staff of the Construction Bureau and will report to the government office within days.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Farmer Dies of Illness in Prison</p>
<p>Last year, the agricultural harvest was abundant, but because of low grain prices, farmers were greatly affected. In addition, due to years of famine, landlords pressed for rent even more. Farmers were overwhelmed by debt and found it difficult to cope. As a result, there were countless cases of landlords imprisoning tenants who failed to pay rent. According to a survey last winter, there were more than 500 tenants in custody. The detention center was overcrowded, which was detrimental to hygiene. There have been several cases of illness. The other day, Zhang Sengui, a farmer from Mochen Township, owed rent to a certain family and was imprisoned on December 31st last year. Zhang was already 56 years old and became ill after being imprisoned. There was also a lack of medical care in the prison, so he died of illness in prison on the 28th of last month. After the prison clerk reported to the county government for verification, the family of the deceased was notified to come to the county to collect the body.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Five Female Prisoners Escape from Detention Center</p>
<p>The county prison's detention center held eight female prisoners whose cases had not been decided. The guard, Aunt Liu, was over fifty years old. Yesterday (the 1st) at around 5:00 PM, she followed the usual procedure and locked up the prisoners. Unexpectedly, Yan Wangshi, a bandit from Jingjiang, and Li Wangshi (six months' imprisonment), Xu Soshi (ten years' imprisonment), Qiu Zhangshi (five years' imprisonment), and He Chenshi (a major criminal accused of murdering her husband, He Yunlin), five prisoners whose cases had not been decided, tied up their fellow prisoners Sun Caodi, Dai Caishi, Yang Yushi, and the female guard, Aunt Liu, with strips of cloth torn from their clothes, forced them to hand over the keys, and opened the door to escape. At around 10:00 PM that night, prison officer Chen learned of the incident and urgently reported it to the county government's public security bureau police team, which searched everywhere, but there was no trace of the five female prisoners. That night, Acting County Chief Wang urgently telegraphed Zheng and other counties to assist in the arrest.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Recent Survey of Japanese Warships and Merchant Ships</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, there are a total of fourteen Japanese residents in Zhenjiang. There is currently one Japanese warship, the "Suko Kai," a cruiser, on the river. There were formerly ten Japanese commercial vessels on the Yangtze River. After the war in Shanghai, the Luoyang, Fengyang, Nanyang, and Xiangyang vessels were equipped to transport 200-300 tons of cargo each time, incurring a loss of about 2,000 yuan each time. The reason why they continue to sail as usual is only to maintain the route.</p>
<p>Taicang</p>
<p>Construction of Dike Banks to Begin on Schedule</p>
<p>The dike banks along the river in the first, sixth, and eighth districts of this county have been collapsing more and more due to years of disrepair. Every time there is a tide, the fields and crops are submerged, resulting in poor harvests at the end of autumn and huge losses. In order to prevent this from happening, the county government is levying labor to repair them. Construction is scheduled to begin on March 6th and will last for one month. The dike bank system will have an outer dike width of 1.67 meters and an inner dike width of 1.33 meters, with a height of 30 centimeters above the water surface.</p>

<p>Yunhe Engineering Bureau Surveys Waterway to the Sea</p>
<p>The Jiangbei Yunhe Engineering Bureau has now dispatched survey team leader Zhang Bin, Li to lead more than twenty surveyors to survey the waterway to the sea. The surveyors arrived in You yesterday and are stationed at the Huayan Temple outside the South Gate. They will start surveying eastward from the Chenan Xinguilai Sanba starting point.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Hangyu Company Officially Operated by the Government</p>
<p>The Hangyu Road Automobile Company was ordered to be reorganized due to poor management. As the Department of Construction's efforts to improve it were ineffective, it was decided to take it back and operate it officially. The company had previously suffered operating losses of more than 90,000 yuan. The Department of Construction first paid 100,000 yuan in cash yesterday based on the assessed price, and 75,000 yuan in government bonds. The remaining 25,000 yuan in cash will also be allocated by the department soon.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Cause Disaster, Boats Sink</p>
<p>There was wind and rain on February 28th, which was even worse at night. Countless boats along the river sank due to the strong wind and waves. Two paper cargo boats and one jar boat that had come from Shangjiang that night suddenly sank because their masts were blown off by the wind. Nine boatmen drowned, and two died. The paper cargo and jars were all sunk in the middle of the river, with losses exceeding 5,000 yuan. Also, the tide was stirred up by the wind, and many houses along the river collapsed.</p>
<p>Mingguang</p>
<p>Security Team Defeats Bandit Gang</p>
<p>The county security team reported yesterday from the Shiba district that there were hundreds of bandits in the Dayaoying area who were attempting to flee south. After receiving the report, squadron leader Yang Jianping led his team at night to block and intercept them. At dawn on the 27th, they made contact with the bandits in the Duangou area and engaged in a fierce battle all day. At dusk, the bandits escaped through a small path. Squadron Leader Yang is now planning to join forces with the Gangtai Security Team to investigate and take action together.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Acting Chairman Lang Guen-p'u and Others Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>About to go to Beijing to report on the anti-Japanese campaign.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that Su Ma has already returned home via Western Europe.</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army's strength remains extremely formidable.</p>
<p>Lang Guen-p'u, the Acting Chairman and Director of Finance of Heilongjiang Province, Zhou Weitai, the Director of Industry, Zhou Deyu, the Secretary-General, He Yin, the Confidential Secretary, You Sui, the Chief Secretary, Zhang Linsui, the Chief of Staff of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office, Wu Yuandan, the Adjutant, Li Pizu, the Chief of the General Staff Office, Wang Binqing, the member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and over forty others, arrived in Shanghai on the Soviet Russian cargo ship "Tongli" on the 27th. Mr. Lang is scheduled to go to Beijing next week to report to the central government on the situation in the Northeast. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Zhou Weitai at his residence yesterday and learned about the hardships encountered by Mr. Zhou and his party on their way to Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Difficult Journey: According to them, after retreating from Heihe, they inquired about the way to Vladivostok. Fortunately, they were able to borrow vacant rooms at our consulate in Vladivostok to survive hunger and cold. There used to be Japanese ships traveling between Vladivostok and Shanghai every week, but it was certain that they would encounter trouble. Therefore, they decided to take a Russian ship to Shanghai. However, Russian ships carried cargo but not passengers. After much negotiation, they were finally allowed to board. However, the "Tongli" ship, which was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai on January 18, did not depart for Shanghai until around February 20, a delay of more than thirty days. The forty people traveling together endured countless hardships on this cargo ship.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Troops: Among the anti-Japanese troops who retreated into Russian territory, there were over two thousand troops under Su Bingwen and over one thousand troops under Li Du and Wang Delin. As for Chairman Ma's troops, they have been handed over to his subordinates, and the current situation is unclear. As for the Volunteer Army lurking in the mountains and forests of the Eastern Provinces, there are still forty to fifty thousand men. Although they are able to avoid hunger and cold, they lack bullets and their strength is not great. Fortunately, the people of the Northeast have always maintained close ties with the Volunteer Army. If there is a shortage of supplies needed by the Volunteer Army, they will do their best to provide them. If our army launches an expedition out of the Pass in the future, it may not be a helping hand.</p>
<p>Ding Chao Loses Integrity: As for Ding Chao, he did not retreat into Russian territory, nor was he arrested. It is said that he has surrendered to the puppet state, which is regrettable for his late-life integrity. As for those who did not share the same goals among the forty people who came south, we can only let them be.</p>
<p>Su Ma's Whereabouts</p>
<p>When we were in Vladivostok, we heard that Generals Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan had already passed through Moscow and were returning home via Western Europe by ship from France. However, when we arrived in Shanghai, there was no news of them. Currently, Wu Huanzhang, Mr. Ma's representative in Shanghai, has already telegraphed Deputy Chairman Zhang in Peiping and the National Government in Nanking to inquire about the whereabouts of the two gentlemen. As of today, no reply has been received. Mr. Lang will go to Beijing: We felt quite tired after arriving in Shanghai, so we are taking a short rest here. Acting Chairman Lang will go to Beijing next week to report to the central government on the situation in the three northeastern provinces. It is undecided whether we will go to Beijing or not.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the Past: He finally said that during the Battle of Nenjiang Bridge led by General Ma and the Battle of Hailar led by General Su, the Japanese forces in the Eastern Provinces had not yet been firmly established, and the strength of the Volunteer Army was also extremely formidable. If our army could resist the enemy and leave the Pass, we could attack from both sides, and the Japanese would be exhausted. Although we could not completely annihilate the enemy, we could certainly inflict heavy losses. Unified command and fighting against the enemy to recover the three northeastern provinces was not without a glimmer of hope. Now it's all over.</p>
<p>Zhou Weitai's Talk: This time, I came to Shanghai from Heihe and plan to go to Peiping to visit my relatives. I will not stay long. I regret that I failed to carry out my original intention in supporting Chairman Ma's anti-Japanese campaign. I have failed the government's trust and the people's expectations. Since things have changed, I do not want to express any opinions to others. Now that I have been honored with an interview and appreciated your good intentions, I will summarize my personal experience and answer. As for the military actions and various plans over the past year, and the reasons for the ultimate failure to save the situation, the details are complicated and cannot be fully explained in a few words, nor can they be answered by me alone. I will not go into details here.</p>
<p>Heihe Gold Mine: In the eighth year of the Republic of China, I founded the Heihe Fengyuan Gold Mine, which has been fifteen years ago. When I was serving as an official in various provinces before, I was young and strong and eager to make achievements. However, the situation was turbulent and there was no peace. Therefore, I made it my mission not to enter the political arena and to develop industry in the border areas. Therefore, I would not enter the provincial capital unless there was an important official matter to discuss. When Military Governor Wu Xingquan was in charge of Jiang Province, he repeatedly tried to keep me in important positions, but I politely declined, because I did not want to change my original intention. In April of last year, Chairman Ma and his colleagues came to Heihe. Since he had known me well when he was the commander of the garrison, he offered me the position of provincial commissioner. Because I could not refuse firmly, I took the position of industry on the condition that I would not receive a salary and that I would be allowed to resign after the lost territories were recovered. When Chairman Ma led his troops on an expedition, he also ordered me to concurrently serve as the head of civil affairs and police.</p>
<p>Acting Chairman Lang: At that time, Lang Juchen, as the Director of Finance, acted as the Chairman, and Xu Qingshan, as the Commander of the Garrison, acted as the Deputy Commander. Xu was an old subordinate of Chairman Ma, while Lang and Chairman Ma were close friends, and I was a long-time friend of both of them. Military and civilian affairs were concentrated in Heihe, making it a fundamental and important place. The responsibility for maintaining the situation was jointly borne by the three of us. We discussed everything with each other, and when there were differences of opinion between the military and civilians, we always used compromise methods to mediate and maintain the overall situation. Therefore, we were able to get along harmoniously from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Supporting Nine Months: Finance is the lifeline of the military. All personnel and administrative matters must be based on fundraising. Heihe has no income, except for the gold produced by the Fengyuan and Xing'an factories, which are operated by merchants, to stimulate the market. At that time, the needs were huge and there was no way to raise funds. Therefore, in the name of the original official silver house, banknotes were issued, and they were circulated far and wide by relying on the proceeds from the two sales of gold. At that time, if banknotes were not issued, it would be like cooking without rice, and without the cash from the two factories, it would be like water without a source. We were able to support it for nine months because of this.</p>
<p>Heihe Transportation: In winter and spring, Heihe is connected to Bu Kui by land, and in summer and autumn, it is connected to Harbin by water. Merchants travel back and forth in an endless stream, and food and goods are imported by boat and car. Since the military uprising, both land and water routes have been blocked by the enemy. The limited food reserves caused great panic. Therefore, a food maintenance association was established to distribute food according to the population. Various methods were used to purchase and transport food from various counties in the south. If that was not enough, food was purchased from Russian territory. Since I have been living in the border area for a long time, I have considerable feelings for all parties and can still be trusted. Therefore, what the government could not do was done in the name of merchants or individuals. The same was done for various materials. The difficulties encountered cannot be overstated. It was almost a miracle that we did not fall into a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Self-Made Wooden Wheels: The Heilongjiang River freezes in winter, and can only be used for transportation in summer and autumn. However, there are few sailboats, and they are extremely slow. It takes more than a month to travel back and forth from Heihe to the area north of Qikluo. In the summer of last year, we considered this and, in the midst of a lack of everything, we recruited merchant shareholders and collected materials to build a wooden ship called Hailanpao to transport grain and goods, so that we would not have to worry. The travelers also praised its convenience. Hailanpao is the original name of Heihe, so it was named after it.</p>
<p>Sparse Population: Heihe is more than 50 li along the border, with a sparse population. Robbers and thieves appear and disappear unpredictably, causing trouble for a long time. Moreover, during this eventful time, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted. Those who become bandits are especially numerous. The responsibility for maintaining security is the exclusive responsibility of the police. Therefore, the Heihe Public Security Bureau was reorganized to ensure the safety of the market. In winter, a security team of 240 people was established. The necessary guns, ammunition, and rations were jointly raised by the government and merchants. Several groups of bandits were wiped out before they could spread. Recently, people from Heihe who came to Shanghai continued to talk about the security situation there, saying that if it were not for this move, it would have become a bandit area.</p>
<p>Unity and Consistency: All of the above-mentioned tasks of maintaining the rear area were my duty. Even though I repeatedly used my family's assets to subsidize military expenses, and this time I left Heihe and sacrificed the mineral resources that I had managed for many years and the various businesses that I had prepared, the losses were indeed great, but since it was a matter of saving the country, it was not worth mentioning. However, due to the lack of weapons and soldiers, and the lack of support from the surrounding areas, we were unable to sustain it in the end. We had no choice but to return to the country by way of a detour. Although the people of the country can understand our difficulties, we deeply regret it when we look back. Now, the situation in the north is becoming more and more dangerous. The previous vehicle has overturned, and the coming cart is coming. How should we unite as one and work together to crush the strong power and recover the lost territories, so as to avoid falling into a state of immunity to death? Looking forward to the future, what I hope all the people of the country will work together to achieve.</p>
<p>City Federation Issues Letters</p>
<p>To Promote Wartime Organizations</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday sent letters to organizations such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, and the Shanghai All Roads Business Federation, saying: "Dear Sirs, the national situation is getting more and more dangerous. The news from Rehe is even worse than before. The military officers in the north are still living in extravagance and luxury, and neglecting border defense. If we do not seek remedies urgently, it will be more than enough to lead to national subjugation and racial extinction. It is not too late to attempt it now. The country is the accumulation of the people. There is no government that is scattered without the scattering of the people. Shanghai is the center of culture and the important town of economy. If we say that there are no organizations, then the names can be changed and counted. If we say that they are not scattered, then the work of saving the country is divided. Our association has learned from this and issued a declaration to advise all the citizens of the city on February 24, especially to promote the wartime organization as the first righteousness, believing that if the citizens of Shanghai can move together, then all the people can move together, and if all the people can move together, then the government can move together. Our association's purpose is to save the country, and we do not want to take the lead in success, and we do not dare to fall behind in responsibility. We have always adhered to this purpose. We only see that the declaration has been issued for a few days, and letting virtue can be the wind. Therefore, we do not measure our strength and act as pioneers. If we are approved, we would like to follow. Time waits for no one, please show us the way forward. Corresponding letters are requested to be checked and replied to."</p>

<p>We must fight desperately to defend the land that has not been lost.</p>
<p>Continue to mobilize the people to fight hard.</p>
<p>丨Speech at the Youth Association the day before yesterday丨</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that since the outbreak of the war in Rehe, people across the country have been paying attention. The Shanghai Baxianqiao Youth Association specially launched a lecture series on the Rehe issue, inviting Mr. Xiong Xiling, Huang Yanpei, and Zang Qifang, who had just arrived in Shanghai from North China, to speak for three days starting on the 1st. The day before yesterday was the first day, with speeches by Mr. Huang Yanpei and Zang Qifang. There was a large audience. The following is a record of Zang's speech:</p>
<p>After September 18th: I just listened to Mr. Huang Renzhi's speech on the situation in Rehe, and how the people of the whole country should work hard to achieve the goal of preserving Rehe and recovering the Northeast. This is something that everyone should not forget every moment. Now I will talk to you about the situation in the Northeast from the September 18th Incident to the present. The reason why we have to defend Rehe to the death now is to recover the Northeast in the future. The Rehe issue was caused by the Northeast issue, so our eyes should be on the Northeast when the Rehe military situation is urgent.</p>
<p>How Should We: Now Japan is concentrating its forces to attack Rehe because they believe that the Northeast Volunteer Army has been wiped out and there is no worry about the rear. Attacking Rehe is to preserve the Northeast. This is Japan's plan. What should we do? We should mobilize the people of the Northeast who have always resisted Japan, so that they believe that the "wiped out" have not really been wiped out. On the one hand, we should disrupt their rear, so that their original plan cannot be realized. On the other hand, we should contain their forces, so that our Rehe can be guarded more firmly. Therefore, at present, in addition to concentrating the strength of the whole country to support Rehe, we should not forget the Northeast, that is, we should carry out resistance and recovery work at the same time. Below, I will divide the situation in the Northeast after the September 18th Incident into five periods to explain.</p>
<p>First Period: The first period is from the September 18th Incident to the Jiangqiao Battle, that is, from September 18th to November 4th of the tenth year. The Shenyang Incident occurred on the night of September 18th. Changchun, Kaiyuan, Tieling, Sipingjie and other places along the South Manchuria Railway were occupied at the same time. Until the 21st, Jilin was seized. In just a few days, most of the Liaoning and Jilin provinces fell. At that time, the local civil and military officials had no choice but to retreat. This is the main reason why the Northeast was lost. The people had no awareness of the incident beforehand and were not prepared at all. Once the country was lost, the pain was imaginable. However, because they were not prepared, they were also helpless. This is the situation in the first period. Second Period: The second period is from the Jiangqiao Battle to the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou. After occupying the Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the Japanese further attempted to seize the Heilongjiang provincial capital and Harbin. They believed that without getting these two places, they could not achieve their goal of annexing the Northeast, nor could the puppet state appear on March 1 last year. Therefore, the Japanese resorted to threats against the civil and military officials of Heihe and Harbin, wanting to obtain Heihe and Harbin in the same way as they had seized Liaoning and Jilin. However, the loss of Liaoning and Jilin was because the local civil and military officials did not resist and offered them with both hands, and the people were unprepared and helpless. The situation in Heihe and Harbin was completely different. The people, learning from the loss of Liaoning and Jilin, ran around everywhere, making movements to defend the territory with determination. The most prominent were the provincial and municipal party headquarters and the chambers of commerce, which united to urge the local authorities to resist Japan to the death. Fortunately, General Ma Zhanshan was ordered to act as the chairman of Jiang Province with the title of Heihe Garrison Commander. After arriving in the province, he immediately raised the banner of anti-Japanese resistance and fought with the Japanese. However, when General Ma returned to the province, the provincial treasury was empty, to the point that he did not even have thirty yuan to buy vegetables. The difficulty was imaginable. Because of the support of the people in Heihe and Harbin, the army's supplies gradually became available. However, it was difficult for General Ma to win by collecting troops that were not under his command to resist the Japanese's strong armor and sharp weapons. However, from November 4th to November 20th, half a month of hard fighting caused the Japanese army to suffer thousands of casualties, which the Japanese had not expected when they occupied Liaoning and Jilin. Until Hei Province could not be defended, he retreated to Hailun in order to echo each other with Harbin. After retreating to Hailun, he maintained it until the end of the 20th year. During these two months, the people of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang hoped for one thing, that Jinzhou was still in our hands and that the main forces inside the Pass should be concentrated in Jinzhou as soon as possible. If the Japanese army marched westward, they would fight them to the death. Therefore, the organization of volunteer armies was brewing everywhere to back up the government. The people hoped to accompany the patriotic soldiers who killed the enemy. However, on January 2nd of the 21st year, our army lightly abandoned Jinzhou again. The disappointment of the people in the Northeast can be imagined. However, the strength of the people's anti-Japanese resistance had already surged up. This is the situation in the second period.</p>
<p>Third Period: The third period is from the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou to General Ma Zhanshan's re-rising to resist Japan. Although the withdrawal of troops from Jinzhou dealt a blow to the people's anti-Japanese movement, the anti-Japanese spirit grew especially strong. Not long after, Harbin fell. On February 5th, the main force of the Japanese army entered Harbin. On March 1st, the puppet state was established. The Japanese further suppressed the people's anti-Japanese forces everywhere with military force, which inevitably suffered some setbacks. This is the situation in the third period.</p>
<p>Fourth Period: The fourth period is from April 3rd of last year, when General Ma Zhanshan escaped from Hei Province and re-rose to resist Japan, to January 2nd of this year, when Shanhaiguan fell. During this period, the people truly fought a bloody battle with the Japanese. The Japanese suffered no less than 20,000 deaths. This situation is not well understood by the outside world, and newspapers have never counted it, because the Chinese side has not investigated, and the Japanese do not announce the truth. Therefore, the outside world does not know the exact number of Japanese casualties. In fact, the minimum is also 20,000 people. This is not a story of propaganda, and solid evidence can be presented. A leader of the Volunteer Army, whose name need not be announced, once used a plan to lure a Japanese brigade to a low-lying place and wiped them out completely, obtaining 2,050 rifles and more than 1,000 iron hats. The head of the brigade commander was cut off with his own saber. Such incidents were not a few. The outside world only knows that there were bitter battles fought by Wang Delin, Feng Zhanhai, Li Haiqing, and other units in the Northeast. In fact, in addition to them, there were many units of 3,000, 5,000, or even 10,000 men scattered throughout the three provinces. Because of inconvenient transportation, they were not well publicized and did not send telegrams, so the outside world knew nothing about it. We also have a piece of evidence, that is, the Japanese never allow the bodies of those killed in battle to be lost. To retrieve a body, they will not hesitate to sacrifice several more people. After retrieving it, they cremate it and put it in a wooden box. A tea servant on the South Manchuria Railway spread the news that from May to September, these wooden boxes were transported back every day, no less than two or three hundred a day. Combining the calculations, saying that the Japanese died 20,000 is actually an underestimate. Because of this reason, the Japanese had no way to deal with the Volunteer Army until the winter of last year. This period was the most active period for the Volunteer Army, and it was also a period that gave Japan a deep and severe blow.</p>
<p>Fifth Period: The fifth period is from the end of last winter to the present. During this period, the situation is very different from before. Ma Su retreated into Russian territory, Feng Li retreated back to Rehe, and part of Wang Delin also retreated to Russian territory. Therefore, the Japanese believe that the Volunteer Army has been wiped out and are concentrating their forces to attack Rehe. However, those who fought hard in the Northeast in the past were not just these few units, but these few units and many other Volunteer Army units jointly resisted Japan. These Volunteer Army units that have not withdrawn from the Northeast are either temporarily lurking or temporarily compromising. There are at least 300,000 people. However, this period is the most critical juncture. If it is done well, the Japanese can be made to be unable to sleep peacefully and be exhausted. Otherwise, not only will the recovery of the Northeast be hopeless, but Rehe and North China will also be difficult to protect, and the whole country will be in great danger. Now, I will talk about them separately.</p>
<p>Three Questions: (1) The Japanese have now driven away the large anti-Japanese troops, and they want to buy off the many small troops with money. Those who do not accept the buy-off will have their guns confiscated. In order to preserve their guns, they have no choice but to compromise with the Japanese temporarily. This compromise is a temporary expedient, which is acceptable. However, if it continues for a long time, the danger will be extremely great, because people are easily accustomed to comfort. Without pain, it is necessary to forget the hatred of national subjugation. Therefore, we should take advantage of the fact that the Japanese have not yet achieved the goal of buying them off and mobilize them to resist Japan permanently. (2) On the Rehe side, if we can resist for three months, the people of the Northeast, even with their bare hands, are willing to fight the Japanese to the death. If we cannot support it for a long time and fail after a resistance, the people of the Northeast will inevitably be disappointed. Therefore, on the one hand, we must actively support Rehe, and on the other hand, we must quickly support the armed comrades who are resisting Japan in the Northeast, so that they know the government's determination to resist. (3) The anti-Japanese resistance of the people in the Northeast is definitely not for the sake of officialdom. There may be a very small number who are for the sake of officialdom. The resistance of the regular army may be for rewards. The resistance of the people is to protect their lives, property, and ancestral graves. Therefore, if the government does not find ways to reward the Volunteer Army who are sacrificing their lives to save the country, the anti-Japanese spirit of the Northeast will gradually decline. These three questions are extremely important. In addition, the lack of contact and guidance among the Northeast Volunteer Army is a local issue that is easy to solve.</p>
<p>Two Examples: In short, the reason why we have to fight with the Japanese now is because the survival of the Northeast is the key to the survival of China. This is not just a slogan, and the evidence is very conclusive. Now I will give two examples: (1) Mr. Huang just mentioned that China's foreign trade had a particularly large deficit last year, totaling 400 million Haikwan taels. Do you know what the reason is? It is because of the loss of the Northeast. In terms of foreign trade volume, China's interior has an annual deficit, while the three northeastern provinces have an annual surplus. The foreign trade volume of the three northeastern provinces accounts for one-third of the country's total. This is in terms of economic lifeline, and the Northeast occupies a very important position. (2) The land in the Northeast has not been fully developed. Every year, millions of people from Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces move to the Northeast. In addition to those who go in the spring and return in the winter, no less than 500,000 people stay in the Northeast every year. The population density in the inland provinces is high, and the Northeast can be used as an overflow. The problem of China's overpopulation can be solved. This is in terms of immigration, and the Northeast occupies a very important position. Furthermore, internationally, both Japan and Russia attach great importance to the Northeast. Even Britain and the United States believe that the Northeast is related to world prosperity and do not want it to be monopolized by Japan. In short, from an economic and international perspective, it is not that the loss of the Northeast has nothing to do with China. It can be said that if the Northeast is lost, China will inevitably be lost, which is not alarmist. Three Conclusions: Based on the situation we have said above, we can draw three conclusions. First, since the September 18th Incident, various parts of the Northeast have continued to fall, so that it is now difficult to clean up. This is not because of insufficient material resources, but because of a too weak mentality. The arms factories in the three northeastern provinces had a large stock of guns, artillery, and ammunition, and there were also more than 200 airplanes. How could the material resources be too bad? However, due to the weak mentality, they retreated again and again. Looking back at the armed forces of the people in the Northeast, with only 100 or 200 bullets for self-defense guns, they were able to resist for a year and a half, which is even more clear. Second, we want to ask whether we should first recover the Northeast and then talk about national revival, or should we first seek revival and then go to recover the Northeast? Our conclusion is that it is difficult for the Chinese nation to revive without first recovering the Northeast. Therefore, we should strive to recover the Northeast first, and then talk about national revival. Third, the anti-Japanese spirit of the people in the Northeast is still enthusiastic, but there is a great danger of being bought off by the Japanese. Therefore, I hope that the people of the whole country, in addition to paying attention to Rehe, will continue to work hard to support the Northeast Volunteer Army, and must make their anti-Japanese spirit and actions continue to grow, and not gradually decline.</p>
<p>National Responsibility: Finally, we recognize the above three conclusions, and we can also get a general conclusion, that is, it is as lucky as the sky if Rehe can be defended for three months. Even if it cannot be defended for three months, we should not be discouraged or disappointed. Once Rehe is lost, we can use the method of supporting and mobilizing the people of the Northeast to also support and mobilize the people of Rehe. In short, for the land that has not been lost, we must fight desperately to resist and defend it. For the land that has been lost, we must never admit that it has been lost and continue to mobilize the people to fight hard. Isn't this a way to deal with the land that has not been lost and a way to deal with the land that has been lost? Finally, there is one more sentence: At the beginning of the establishment of the Northeast Association, I hope that all compatriots in the country can participate and become members of the Northeast Association, because recovering the Northeast and building the Northeast are the responsibility of all compatriots in the country.</p>
<p>People's Records</p>
<p>Minister of Military and Political Affairs He Yingqin returned to Beijing on the 7th night train of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at 11:30 last night.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Wu Chaochu arrived in Shanghai by night train from Beijing at 8:00 this morning.</p>
<p>President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke is scheduled to leave Beijing by express train this afternoon and arrive in Shanghai at 11:20 tonight.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>Declaration for Saving National Treasury Bonds</p>
<p>A reporter from the National News Agency went to the Bankers' Association yesterday to meet Secretary-General Lin Kanghou and asked him if he had any financial opinions to publish. According to Mr. Lin, he has nothing to express so far. However, in my position and from my standpoint, I am very willing to contribute my opinions that are beneficial to the country to the press. However, there is one important statement. I usually keep my conversations brief, but reporters often add to them in order to fully express their views, which may lead to a loss of their true meaning. For example, a few days ago, someone asked me about saving national treasury bonds. What I said was only that Premier Song had contacted various banks in the north when he was in Peiping and Tianjin, and there should be no problem. However, a certain newspaper reported that there would be a new issuance of public bonds and that the banking industry could bear it. I definitely did not say this and should be corrected. Moreover, I have served in the banking industry for more than ten years and in the Bankers' Association for five or six years. How can I not know the heavy burden of the various banks? This is enough to prove that I did not say the above.</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Second District Municipal Joint Council Telegraphs National Troops to Resist the Enemy <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>And Urges Citizens Throughout the District to</p>
<p>Save on Food and Clothing to Provide Support</p>
<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Joint Council was formally established the day before yesterday. At that time, it was resolved to telegraph to the national troops to unite in resisting the enemy, and to urge the citizens throughout the district to save on food and clothing, and donate funds to defend against aggression. It is now learned that the council's telegram and exhortation have been issued. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Please National Troops Unite to Resist the Enemy (Titles omitted)</p>
<p>Since the violent sun [Japan] invaded, our territory has been lost. The East Province has already fallen, and the Shanghai Incident has just ended. The humiliation has not been avenged, and the blood has not yet dried. Now, they are again losing their minds and committing outrages on our hot border, coveting our Tianjin and Beijing. They disregard international law and abandon humanitarian justice like worn-out shoes, relying on their strong power to escalate the situation. Now, the draft proposal of the Nineteen-Nation Committee has been unanimously passed in the League of Nations, so right and wrong are clear, and justice is obvious. If we do not rise up to resist and fight, we will inevitably place our country in an irrecoverable situation. The crisis is increasingly urgent, and it is unbearable. The only solution is to use armed self-defense. We deeply hope that our national troops will rise up together and swear to defend against aggression to seek survival for the nation, eliminate the barbarian leaders for the world. Success is certainly gratifying, and we can take this opportunity to severely punish the barbarians. Even if we fail, what harm is there? It can also promote the indomitable spirit of our Chinese nation. We citizens see the difficulties of the times and are extremely indignant. We are willing to use our lives and property as a backing for our national anti-Japanese troops, swearing to kill the enemy and share life and death. We present these words with tears, hoping for your kind consideration. The Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Joint Council respectfully salutes you.</p>
<p>Exhortation to Citizens Throughout the District (Titles omitted) Since the violent sun [Japan] invaded and the Northeast fell, Yuguan has been lost, Tianjin and Beijing are shaken, our rivers and mountains are shattered, the copper camels evoke sorrow over the thorns, and the country is in danger. The wheat and millet grieve for the pain of the fallen palace. The surging Black River, the vast Divine Land. Alas, how can our nation not be heartbroken? Now that the government is resisting Japan, it has made a firm decision. Some are engaged in melee combat on the battlefields, while others are volunteering and awaiting orders, with righteousness reaching the heavens. However, once the war starts, it is difficult to end. Military pay, ammunition, and supplies all need to be replenished. Xian Gao saved the country, and Bu Shi contributed his wealth. The spirit of patriotism follows these ancient examples. It is hoped that all citizens will be of one mind, save on food and clothing, and enthusiastically take turns contributing. Do not say that the knife has not yet reached your head and allow yourselves to sit idly by. You must know that the voracious eating and devouring are pressing, and disaster is imminent. Better to be shattered like jade than to be preserved like tile. This is the time! This council sees that the country's demise is imminent and feels that silence is difficult to bear. Loving our country, we dare not lag behind. Relying on the strength of the masses to save the nation, we are determined to be the vanguard of all citizens, encouraging the three armies and boosting our morale, to eliminate the fierce and stubborn and secure our national borders. May our citizens truly benefit the country. (Same name as above)</p>

We have telegraphed to you on Qiao Day. However, the matters related to assistance, as the name suggests, cannot be accomplished without money. This matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved by the efforts of one person. Currently, the military situation on the Rehe border is extremely tense, and supplies are urgently needed. We hope that everyone will rise up together and generously donate. At this critical moment, it is time for our people to contribute money to relieve the crisis.

<p>The Paper Industry Held a Meeting to Raise Patriotic Donations. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Paper Industry Association, in order to raise patriotic donations, held a tea party for member representatives at its office on Sijing Road. More than eighty representatives from the industry attended, including Liu Minzhai, Xia Kangmin, Sheng Langting, and Jin Runxiang. Chairman Liu asked Zhang Peizhen to chair the meeting due to a dental illness. Zhang Zhenfan recorded. The meeting proceeded as planned. (1) Deputy Chairman Zhang reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the national army and the volunteer army in Rehe are resisting Japan. Our merchants should know that this battle is far more important than the one in Shanghai. The life of our nation is at stake. We must face it with the spirit of national mobilization. The soldiers are willing to die, and the people are willing to give money to face the national crisis together, so as to avoid the final failure. Currently, the soldiers at the front need bicycles, cars, gas masks, etc., urgently. Therefore, we have specially convened this meeting of industry representatives to discuss fundraising methods together. After the chairman's report, the discussion began. (2)</p>
<p>At the meeting, Zhan Peilin pledged 200 yuan, and Dong Hefu pledged 250 yuan. (3) It was decided to organize a paper industry national crisis fundraising team, with Liu Minzhai as the general captain, Zhang Peizhen and Lu Munan as the deputy captains, and Zhan Peilin and Zhou Zhenhong as the general staff.

<h3 id="e92">Shipping Representatives Go to the Capital <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>To Petition for the Amendment of the Maritime Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai shipping industry, because the Legislative Yuan passed the Maritime Law, Article 23 of which contains provisions that are very unfavorable to shipping companies and are practically impossible to implement, has publicly elected representatives to go to the capital to petition for amendments. The general situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The provisions are improper. Shanghai shipping companies believe that Article 33 of the promulgated Maritime Law stipulates that if a sunken merchant ship obstructs navigation, the customs authorities may carry out salvage or demolition if they deem it necessary, and all costs shall still be borne by the shipowner. They believe this is inappropriate and practically difficult to implement. A similar incident occurred last year, causing major difficulties.</p>
<p>Repeated requests for amendments. After the Dachang ship was sunk by the Dahua ship last year, the customs authorities notified the Dachang shipowner, limiting them to salvage the ship, otherwise the customs authorities would carry out the salvage at the expense of the shipowner. At that time, it was estimated that the cost of salvaging the ship would be tens of thousands of yuan. The Dachang shipowner did not want to salvage it again and reported it to the Shipping Association. After discussion, it was decided that after the shipowner abandoned the salvage rights, the costs of salvaging or demolishing the ship, if the customs authorities deemed it necessary, should be borne by the government. Because shipping companies have already paid tonnage dues, the customs authorities should be responsible for maintaining navigation routes, and the shipowners should not be responsible for the salvage costs. The Shipping Association has repeatedly contacted the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Finance to request corrections to this provision, but has not yet received any results.</p>
<p>Representatives go to the capital. Shanghai shipping companies believe that it cannot be delayed any longer, so the Shipping Association held a meeting to discuss and decided to send three representatives to the capital to petition. Chen Bogang (Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association), Chen Shuntong (General Manager of the Zhongwei Shipping Company, a senior figure in the shipping industry), and Wei Wenhan (Legal Advisor to the Shipping Association) were elected to represent the entire industry in the city and went to the capital yesterday morning to petition for amendments.</p>
<p>Request for corrections. Chen Bogang, Chen Shuntong, and others, entrusted with the important task of representing all Shanghai shipping companies, went to the Ministry of Transportation in the capital to meet with Minister Zhu Jia骅 to explain the facts and reasons why Article 23 of the Maritime Law was difficult to implement, and to present their opinions on the amendments that should be made, requesting Minister Zhu to accommodate the opinions of all shipping companies and submit Article 23 to the Legislative Yuan for re-amendment. The three representatives are currently petitioning in the capital.</p>
<h3 id="e93">National Economic Council Plans to Build Highways in Seven Provinces <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Convenes a Specialist Meeting to Determine Routes</p>
<p>To be Completed by the End of This Year</p>
<p>Sends League of Nations Advisor to Assist Jiangxi in Road Construction</p>
<p>In order to expedite transportation and facilitate bandit suppression, the central government is actively planning to build highways in various provinces. Chairman Jiang and Minister Song are paying particular attention to this. They previously engaged in a large-scale plan to build connecting highways in the seven provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hunan. The National Economic Council is urging the provinces to implement the plan. The total length of the routes is over 20,000 kilometers, requiring over 100 million yuan. Minister Song, recognizing the provinces' insufficient financial resources, is allocating significant funds from the central government to provide continuous assistance. The construction methods are being carried out in phases, depending on the urgency of the situation and the financial strength of each region.</p>
<p>Expanding to seven provinces. It is reported that since receiving the order, the council has first focused on the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and is working closely with the construction authorities in each province. The highways in the three provinces that were completed in October last year include the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, as well as parts of the Hangzhou-Huizhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, Xuanjing, and Wuhu roads. Since Chairman Jiang convened a highway conference in the seven provinces in Hankou, the first phase of highway construction in the seven provinces was set to a total length of approximately 1,600 kilometers. In Henan Province, there are the routes from Zhang Laorenbu to Huangchuan, Shuangliushu to Xiaojieling, Zhou Dangban to Xuandian, and Guangshan to Jingfu. In Hubei Province, there are the routes from Xiaojieling to Wuxue, Susong to Qishui, Luotian to Yingshan, and Tianjiazhen to Qishui. In Anhui Province, there are the routes from Ningguo to Shexian, Shexian to Yulingguan, Wangniudun to Langxi, Langxi to Shilipu, Xuancheng to Jiepai, and Yingshan to Taihu. In Jiangsu Province, there is the route from Nanjing to Wangniudun. In Zhejiang Province, there are the routes from Changhua to Yulingguan and Xiasi'an to Jiepai. In Jiangxi Province, there is the route from Yujiang to Guangfeng. The construction of the above routes has started one after another, and all provinces are enthusiastically engaged in the work, with the completion deadline not far off.</p>
<p>Specialist meeting. Recently, in order to promote the implementation plan, the council convened a specialist committee meeting on highways in the seven provinces. Concrete regulations were also made for the routes to be built in the second phase, with a total length of approximately 6,000 kilometers, to be completed by the end of December this year. The important meetings and key bandit areas in the seven provinces are generally passed by the routes in this phase. In addition to those built by the provinces, there are also those designated by Chairman Jiang to be built by the military.</p>
<p>Increasing highway construction. The main routes in Henan Province are Yejiaji to Zhang Laorenbu, Hanchuan to Xinyang, Xiangcheng to Hanchuan, Luoyang to Linru, and Yongcheng to Shangqiu. The main routes in Hubei Province are Shahan to Yichang and Laohekou to Mengjialou. The main routes in Anhui Province are from Wujiang via Hexian, Chaoxian, Hefei, and Liuan to Yejiaji, and Hefei to Anqing. The main routes in Jiangxi Province are Linchuan to Yongfeng, Jingdezhen to Huangjinbu, Ji'an to Chaling, and Shanggao to Liuyang. The main routes in Jiangsu Province are Zhenjiang to Shanghai, Pukou to Jiangtian, Pukou to Wujiang, Suqian to Muyang, and Taierzhuang. The main routes in Zhejiang Province are Cao'e to Shengxian, Xinchang to Linhai, Fuyang to Jiangshan, and Jinhua to Yongjia. The main routes in Hunan Province are Liuyang to Wanzai, Liuyang to Yong'an City, Baji to Yongxin, Fengxian to Changde, and Taohuaping to Huitong. It is expected that if all of this phase is completed, the connection between the capital and the cities of the seven provinces can be directly reached without obstruction.</p>
<p>Unified planning. It is reported that in addition to the route plan, the meeting also included unified planning for the naming, numbering, mileage signs, mutual communication of automobiles and long-distance buses, investigation and registration of technical personnel, search and research of road-building materials and automobile fuels, and various technical and administrative matters related to highways. They will be gradually implemented. In addition, due to the bandit suppression situation in Jiangxi recently, road construction is the most tense. The council has recently received a telegram from Chairman Jiang and has sent League of Nations advisors and engineers to urge and assist. It has also tried to allocate and borrow as much as possible road-building tools, such as iron rails and dump trucks.</p>

<p>Each Team's Recruitment Work Is Exceptionally Tense</p>

<p>Chief Captain Hosts New Captains</p>
<p>Chief Captain Wu Tiecheng hosted a tea party yesterday at 4:00 PM at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to welcome the newly appointed captains. Those in attendance included Shi Zhikun, Ke Juchu, Yang Meinan, Fu Zuoheng, Chen Zixin, Zhang Jiqiao, Xu Youfang, Chen Longqing, Lu Fengzhu, Cheng Yujie, Cheng Kefan, Yang Weiyin, Zhu Zixiang, Gu Jiuru, Wang Yinting, Xu Yongnian, Zhang Xianda, Zhang Lixiong, Fu Zaigao, Zhu Binglu, Xie Baosheng, Huang Yuming, Wen Jiangang, Cheng Younan, and over thirty others. After refreshments, Mayor Wu rose to speak, stating in brief, "The China Aviation Association is organized by Shanghai's leaders. Its purpose is to unite the national strength of China, represent the Central Government, raise donations, purchase aircraft, and strengthen our national air defense. Now, the national crisis is increasingly urgent, and a strong enemy is pressing our borders. Due to the lack of adequate national defense equipment, especially the shortage of aircraft, we must resort to using our flesh and blood to resist them. Fortunately, our troops, such as the 19th Route Army, the 5th Army, the Northern Volunteers, and the Rehe Army, all possess the determination to die and sacrifice their lives to resist the enemy. But if we have such fearless troops, and can provide them with the modern weaponry of war, what worries are there that we will not be victorious in every battle? Therefore, the people of our country, with Shanghai as the focus of national attention, hope that you will help, make every effort to proceed, and make Shanghai's success the guiding light for national success." After the speech, the group discussed the methods for each team to carry out recruitment, and the meeting adjourned at 5:50 PM.</p>
<p>Each Team Recruits Staff</p>
<p>The captains of each recruitment team were out yesterday recruiting staff, extremely busy. The results were also very satisfactory. It is expected that the list of team members for each team will be announced soon. Team captains continued to come to collect membership application forms in an endless stream. Huang Boqiao, the director of both the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, took away 5,000 copies. Li Ting'an, the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, took away 5,000 copies. Wu Shanjun of the Roads Association took away 6,000 copies. Zheng Zenan, the chief of the Fourth Tunnel, took away 5,000 copies. It is also heard that each team has convened team meetings to discuss various organized methods. Some advocate taking occupation or organization as a unit, recruiting all people in these occupations and organizations as members of the Aviation Association. If each organization follows this approach, then all citizens of the city, except the unemployed, can be recruited as members.</p>
<p>Children's Day Fees Proposed to Supplement Donations</p>
<p>Fang Debao and Fang Demin, two brothers who are students at the Huahua Middle School on Yuyuan Road, having witnessed the destruction caused by Japanese aircraft in Shanghai last year, and the current bombing of the Rehe people by Japanese aircraft, and recognizing the weakness of our country's air force, which cannot resist the attacks, have bravely initiated the donation of funds for the purchase of a "Children's" aircraft. They urged children to save their candy money and offer it as donations. Children from all teams are also enthusiastically contributing. Today (the 2nd), Fang Debao brought a donation of 270 yuan to the office of the recruitment team of the Aviation Association at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA and paid the full amount. Their patriotic enthusiasm is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Doctors Donate One Day's Income</p>
<p>Li Ting'an, the captain of the 274th team of the Shanghai Municipal Chapter of the China Aviation Association, and the current director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, in order to expand the recruitment work, sent letters to his close friends and figures in the medical and pharmaceutical fields and health experts, inviting them to a meeting at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss recruitment plans. Over two hundred people attended. First, Chairman Li Ting'an reported the purpose of the meeting.

All the guests filled out membership forms and recruitment sheets on the spot, very enthusiastically. A detailed list will be published at a later date. Xi Guansheng, the owner of Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road in this city, representing Zheng Xingpu, proposed that all Chinese and Western doctors present donate their entire day's consultation fees to the China Aviation Association. After Captain Li presented the proposal, it was unanimously approved with applause. The meeting adjourned at about 1:00 AM.</p>
<p>National Customs Officials Donate Over 300,000</p>
<p>According to reliable sources yesterday, national customs officials have now collected donations of approximately 300,000 yuan, which will be remitted to Nanjing within days to purchase aircraft for the purpose of resisting Japan. However, this donation is unrelated to the regular, long-term donation of 5% of monthly salary previously initiated by the customs authorities. The long-term donation is limited to Chinese officials in each customs office, while this large donation was collected from all customs personnel. In addition, it is understood that the long-term donations from Chinese customs officials for February, the first month of the donation period, totaled 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Combining the two items above, the customs authorities have donated a total of over 350,000 yuan.</p>
<p>County Government Allocates a Percentage of Salary to Assist Donations</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs stating that, due to the urgency of foreign aggression, the entire country should unite to support national defense. Aviation aircraft are especially needed. It has been determined that public officials will contribute according to a graded percentage of their salaries. Please comply accordingly. Upon receiving the order, Magistrate Yan issued instructions yesterday that, starting with the February salary, from the magistrate to the staff, all will donate according to the percentage. The money will be remitted to the Department of Civil Affairs. This will be done monthly from now on.</p>

<p>Shi Xingen, Alias, Dies by Poison</p>
<p>Blame Yourself, Yet Pitiable</p>
<p>Shi Xingen, a native of Ningbo, 36 years old, worked as a shop assistant at a German-owned beef noodle shop at 79 Rue du Consulat. However, because Shi had a penchant for gambling, his wages were never enough to cover his spending, and he was heavily in debt. A week ago, he borrowed a fur coat from his colleague, Shen Zhanglong, and sold it for 26 yuan, but unfortunately, he lost that in gambling as well. Unable to return to the shop, he became filled with resentment the day before yesterday and conceived the idea of ending his life. Alone, he went to the Kai Lai Inn at 1 Hubei Road, under the alias Lin Shifa, and attempted suicide by opium smoking. The next morning, the inn's tea boy, Wang Atang, caught sight of him moaning in bed and realized something was wrong. He immediately reported it to the accounting office, who sent him to Huiji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, who ordered detective Peng Yutang to investigate. They found a note next to the deceased with the address of his friend Yan Abao. The detective went to his friend's address and learned that his real name was Shi Xingen. The body was taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Faelan Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Guo Wei to come to the office to examine the body. After confirming the body, the court questioned Yan Abao, who stated that the deceased was his colleague and that his parents were in his hometown. He had borrowed over a hundred yuan from him. He felt sorry for him and had bought a coffin for him, requesting to claim the body. He also recounted the previous events. Prosecutor Guo then confirmed that the deceased Lin Shifa was indeed Shi Xingen, and that he had died of opium poisoning. The body was released to Yan Abao with a written guarantee to claim the body for burial.</p>

<p>丨The incident caused a sensation in the neighborhood due to superstition丨</p>
<p>Xu Fu, a native of Jiangyin, lives at 21 Dongchang Lane, Lan Ni Du, Pudong. He has a wife and a concubine, and their lives are prosperous. Xu's concubine, Ms. Lin, is quite superstitious. It was recently rumored that her brother, Mr. Lin, had taken a position on a certain ship, which encountered an accident near Qingdao. Ms. Xu, upon hearing the news, cried uncontrollably and felt restless. She repeatedly sought divination, which indicated that the prospects were more ominous than auspicious. Ms. Xu Lin became even more mentally disturbed. The day before yesterday, she secretly went to Yangjiadu to purchase a coffin and hired workers to carry the empty coffin to a temporary resting place in the wasteland near Xu's residence, intending to bury it. According to Ms. Xu Lin, it was a coffin for summoning her brother's spirit for burial. The neighbors all found it strange, and the news spread throughout Pudong. The matter came to the attention of Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the Third District, who, given the current unstable situation, feared that bad people might have other intentions. He sent district officer Cai Zanzhou, along with detectives and deputy team leaders, to investigate. After confirming that it was an empty coffin, they went to the residence of the person involved to question Ms. Xu Lin about the truth. Only then did they learn the story. However, the Xu family had no prior knowledge of the matter until the police district sent officers to investigate. Later, Xu reprimanded Ms. Xu Lin for the superstitious act.</p>

<p>Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association: In addition to jointly forming an aid association for the tragic case with the Chaozhou Fellow-Villagers Association for the case of fellow-villager Liu Fugao being shot and killed during an illegal arrest, the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, requesting that they negotiate with the French Minister to China. The express telegram is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, according to a report from our fellow-villager Liu, Liu Fugao, whose ancestral home is Hanci, 39 years old, was a clerk at the Yuan Taiheng sugar store on Hsing Street in . On the afternoon of June 25th, he was passing through the intersection of Ningbo Road on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession when, unexpectedly, a Yue policeman opened fire for no reason. A bullet struck a Cantonese man, Zhu Guoting, in the abdomen, and he died on the spot. Fugao was shot in the abdomen, bled, and collapsed. He was taken to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died around 12:00 that night. Fugao's family is extremely poor. He has an elderly mother, over sixty years old, and young children crying for food. He died tragically. How will they live? In addition to telegraphing his family to come here, we respectfully request your assistance to investigate the case. The Yue policeman opened fire in a bustling street, injuring and killing many people. It is the ultimate disregard for human life. The French Concession authorities do not regret the disaster. At first, they attempted to evade responsibility. The handling of the tragic case has not been clearly stated. If this is not contested, all citizens in the city may face the danger of being killed. Thinking of this, we are filled with indignation. Our association, for the sake of fellowship and humanity, should actively fight and be duty-bound. In addition to taking further effective measures, we jointly request your esteemed Yuan to investigate and quickly issue a serious message to the French Minister to China, demanding that the perpetrators be punished, that the victims be compensated, and that the same incidents will never happen again, ensuring safety for the city.

Briefly stated: "To order an investigation, the incident of many people injured at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory occurred not long ago. Afterwards, the disaster of the boiler explosion and many deaths at the Yonghe Rubber Factory in Zhabei occurred. This is truly alarming.

<h3 id="e100">China National Aviation Corporation Announces Chartered Flight Tour Arrangements <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Air Travel Available at Any Time</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's newly opened aerial tours and aerial trips to Suzhou and Hangzhou are ready, and chartered flight arrangements have also been made, allowing for landings at will. In the midst of this aviation movement, it is also a method of promotion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Aerial Tours Available at Any Time</p>
<p>According to Mr. Cai of the company's sales department, the company's aerial tours are available for passengers at any time. There is no such thing as a stop or start. However, as it is now winter, and the cold is severe, naturally no one wants to spend money on an aerial tour. Therefore, in winter, it naturally enters a state of suspension. Now that spring has returned, anyone who wants to ride can do so at any time. As long as they can gather four people and pay 50 yuan, they can fly for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Newly Chartered Flights Can Land at Will</p>
<p>As for aerial trips to Suzhou and Hangzhou, general passengers regret that they cannot land, otherwise they could take a tour of scenic areas. However, this regret is due to fixed rules that cannot be resolved. Therefore, new chartered flight arrangements have now been made, which can be directed by passengers and land at any time. The prices are divided into several types: (1) The Lockheed aircraft can seat five people, costing 250 yuan per hour. The Stinson aircraft can seat only four people, costing 200 yuan per hour. The minimum time for both is one hour. They are now available for rent. Those who wish to charter them can go to make reservations.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 8:30 PM, four robbers suddenly came to the home of Yu Zhenzhou at 20 Tonghe Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei. All spoke with a Northern Jiangsu accent. The robber wearing a gray cloth gown guarded the front door with a gun, the robber wearing black cloth clothing guarded the back door, and the two robbers wearing blue cloth clothing entered the house, holding guns to prevent the family from making noise. One of the robbers took the opportunity to go upstairs, broke into the bedroom, and ransacked the chests and cabinets, stealing everything. After about half an hour, they were satiated and escaped downstairs. Afterwards, the victim inspected and found that he had lost five small gold rings, one gold hairpin, one gold bracelet, two pairs of silver earrings, and one silver lock. He immediately reported it to the nearby Fourth District Police Station, which reported it to the headquarters, requesting pursuit. Director Lai dispatched police officers and detectives to strictly investigate.</p>

<p>The New Horizon Encounters Danger Mid-Voyage</p>
<p>After Two Days at Sea, It Travels Eighty Miles and the Main Mast is Broken by a Strong Wind</p>
<p>It is Now Returning to Shanghai for Repairs and Is Scheduled to Make a Second Voyage North Next Sunday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the sand junk New Horizon sailed out of Shanghai, intending to make a voyage around the world. Unexpectedly, after only two days at sea, traveling about eighty miles, a strong wind on Thursday night of last week broke the main mast. The huge sail was lowered as a result. It was dark, and the waves were raging. The crew members all looked at each other in dismay. The ship drifted and eventually ran aground on a mudflat. The rudder was also broken. Therefore, the crew decided to return to Shanghai for repairs. It arrived in port on Sunday night, but the crew was not discouraged. The lower spar has now been replaced with sturdier wood, and other parts of the ship have also been repaired. It is now scheduled to depart for the second time next Sunday.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Sand Junk Ship Owners Request Oil Tax Exemption <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>A Petition Submitted Months Ago Has Been Shelved by the Executive Yuan Without Approval</p>
<p>Since the operation of sand junk shipping, the business of sand junk merchants has been declining, almost to the point of being as rare as morning stars. Those who are still able to maintain it are fully supported by the lower tax rate for sand junk shipping and the abolition of the likin tax, which allows them to barely maintain the livelihood of the ship owners. Since the September 18th Incident, with the blockade of the Northeast, the customs has classified soybean oil as a foreign good, increasing the tax rate to 12.5%, causing panic among general shipping merchants and ship owners. They are concerned that the soybean cake and soybeans of the same industry are still tax-exempt as principal goods, while soybean oil has been reclassified as a foreign good and is subject to heavy taxes, which has a huge impact, especially since sand junks have always specialized in transporting soybean oil. Their suffering is immense, and the livelihood of shipping merchants and ship owners is almost cut off. Repeated requests to various superiors have been shelved without approval, and letters have gone unanswered, causing general shipping merchants and ship owners to look forward every day. Zhang Xueliang carried the victory north, and all seaports have thawed. They plan to convene a meeting of fellow tradesmen to discuss and appeal to various agencies, and to contact relevant industry associations to work together, hoping that the strength of the joint efforts will arouse the attention of the authorities.</p>

<p>But a Contract Has Not Yet Been Signed</p>
<p>The Plaintiff Hopes for a Quick Resolution</p>
<p>Qiu Changsheng, residing at 184 Tongren Road, is the adopted son of the late Shanghai businessman Qiu Weiqing. Recently, due to plotting to seize the inheritance, his stepmother, Madam Qiu Sun, through her lawyers Zheng and Kai, filed a complaint with the First Court, accusing him of violating Articles 363 and 365 of the Criminal Code. The prosecution's arguments were briefly: (1) The defendant was originally the son of the Jiang family. Recently, there was even a letter from his biological mother requesting his return to his family. This was well known by the clan members since he was raised. Therefore, during the compilation of the genealogy in the past, it was indicated that he was an adopted son. The defendant, knowing that this was inappropriate, sold it and had another one engraved, and bought the original genealogy. (2) The late Qiu Weiqing had instructed the plaintiff to raise his own son, Changyin, and daughter, Shuying. At the time of his death, he left instructions to take good care of them, and because the plaintiff was a woman and knew that Changsheng was the most unreliable, he ordered his nephew Qiu Sheng'er to manage the property, stating that it must be returned only when the children came of age. He had a will. However, the defendant induced Madame Zhu Qiu and the late Qiu Jia to jointly file a lawsuit against Qiu Sheng'er in court, resulting in the defendant actually controlling everything. (3) The late husband's estate should be inherited by his biological children and the plaintiff, but the defendant is only an adopted son and can only be given a small portion. He actually distributed 45% of the estate to himself, which is why the clan leader Qiu Hengzhi and others refused to sign the division. However, the defendant still took decisive measures and seized it by force. (4) Since Qiu Changsheng is an adopted son, he has no mother-son relationship with the plaintiff. After the death of the late husband, he showed no respect for his elders. Last winter, in order to temporarily avoid his bad treatment, she requested funds from Changsheng to go to Hangzhou for medical treatment. Changsheng initially refused to give it to her, but eventually forced her to sign a receipt. At that time, she was critically ill and could not afford to delay treatment. What does she care about signing the receipt? Forcing his mother to sign a receipt is truly contemptible. After toiling hard with the late husband for 60 years, she has what she has today, but after the husband's death, she is forced to leave by her adopted son. Is there such a thing in the world? (5) On March 4th of this year, Madame Jia died. The defendant immediately plotted to open the iron safe without permission. After much reasoning, the case was reported to the police station, and patrolman Chen Jiting was dispatched to the scene. He guarded it for more than ten days to prevent her from being completely occupied. (6) The residence on Tongfu Road was originally divided and belongs to Changjiu. However, the defendant still occupies it and refuses to return it. He also set up iron bars inside the residence, as if facing a major enemy. It can be imagined that he has an unfavorable heart for the children. Since the court has summoned him several times, the defendant has not appeared. His agent told the court that a settlement was possible and postponed the hearing until yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff's lawyer, Zheng Kai, stated that the delay has continued until now. Recently, they have tried to negotiate a settlement, but a contract has not yet been signed. Therefore, the appellant requested that the shortest possible date be set, even two or three days, in order to handle it. If a settlement can be reached, he will submit a statement withdrawing the claim. The judge, Wen Huan, approved the request and postponed the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Public Concession Bureau Reorganizes House Numbers <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Twenty-Two Roads</p>
<p>Reorganized on April 1st</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Public Concession Bureau is reorganizing the house numbers within the concession. This work will sweep away the chaotic state of the house numbers and will be welcomed by all residents of Shanghai. To date, after three years of work, 75 roads have had all street-facing and lane-facing houses reorganized with new house numbers. This year, it is planned to reorganize 22 roads starting on April 1st. According to the Public Concession Bureau, this initiative was originally launched in 1930, and a special committee was organized to discuss it. The committee then recommended a new method of numbering houses. Roads with an absolute need for house number reorganization were prioritized, followed by others in sequence, in order to reduce temporary inconveniences for residents. The Public Concession Bureau then decided to gradually implement this new system throughout the entire concession. However, due to the large number of roads and lanes within the concession and the complexity of the procedures, it cannot be completed in a short period of time. But once this numbering is completed, it can be used permanently. The numbering method is no longer based on the number of houses. Every twelve feet along the road is numbered, with even and odd numbers on the left and right sides of the road. Lane entrances are numbered the same as the adjacent houses, and houses within the lane are numbered separately. Therefore, even if houses are rebuilt in the future, there is no need to change the house numbers.</p>

<p>"L&gt; Special Education News</p>
<p>"P&gt; Ideal Rural Education (Part 2)</p>
<p>(1) Clearly define the purpose and implementation guidelines of rural education; (2) Increase funding for rural education, and reward talents who handle rural education; (3)  Rural Education Department In-Service Training Seminar during the winter vacation; (4) Merge ordinary  unsuitable  level elementary schools, plan compulsory education areas, and reallocate school locations (sponsored by the education bureaus of various counties); (5) Separately  print textbooks suitable for rural elementary schools; (6) Normal schools pay attention to practical rural education lectures and internships; (7) Implement rural social education effectively;</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p>We cannot bear to see the country perpetually trapped in a semi-colonial state and constantly  divided, so we feel that transforming rural education is the most urgent  matter. However, this is not  just talk; it requires consistent effort from top to bottom. Simply relying on the  rural education, not only is there no education to speak of, but it is also very easy to cause trouble. Education can save the country, but it can also  harm the country, or even destroy it.  How can China's rural education not be disheartening?</p>
<p>Last month, I returned to my hometown on business and took the opportunity to observe the so-called expanded compulsory education.  The rural education in my hometown [Jiangyin], which ranked second in Jiangsu Province, is  unbearable. The rural elementary schools there are shocking.  Reasonable education  is that of the Former Han Dynasty, but a few years ago, an elementary school in my hometown with one or two hundred students now only has thirty or forty. Private schools are everywhere, and farmers have no  respect for schools. Although there are various reasons for this, the fact that expenses have been in arrears for as long as eight months is also a major reason for the bankruptcy of rural education. This is the entire problem of rural education, and I urge the authorities to pay special attention to it. Japan, Italy, and Turkey's revitalization can be used as a lesson. They all relied on the power of education, especially elementary school education. Small countries occupy more than 80% of the national rural education. Why neglect it? Finally, I silently wish that everyone  will work hard on rural education, so that all my ideals will become a reality in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>"P&gt; Zhejiang Education Department Promotes Production Education</p>
<p>Promulgation of Implementation Plan for Affiliated Elementary Schools of Provincial Middle Schools</p>
<p>丨Seven Items Including Sub-Goals, Equipment, and Environment</p>
<p>丨Practical, Concrete, Easy to Implement Teaching</p>
<p>丨Progress Limited to Reporting and Verification This Semester</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department, based on the resolution of this year's Provincial Middle School Affiliated Elementary School Conference, "Please ask the Provincial Education Department to formulate and issue a production education implementation plan to each affiliated elementary school as the basis for education," stated that the reason for our country's  lies in the underdevelopment of agriculture, commerce, and industry. Land cannot be fully utilized, and resources cannot be fully used. The biggest reason is that there are few producers and many consumers. In order to actively relieve the current social danger, it is necessary to promote production education as the foundation of construction. The association's views were insightful and were approved by the directive. The Education Department has specially formulated a production education implementation plan for affiliated elementary schools of provincial middle schools and ordered it to be issued to provincial senior middle schools and other schools to instruct affiliated elementary schools to refer to it for implementation, and the progress of the implementation should be recorded in the "New Facilities" column of the school affairs report form at the end of the semester for assessment.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Middle School Affiliated Elementary School Production Education Implementation Plan</p>
<p>(1) Determine Goals</p>
<p>The implementation of production education in affiliated elementary schools of provincial middle schools is based on the overall goals of elementary education as determined by the Ministry of Education. The overall goals of elementary education are: Elementary schools should develop children's physical and mental health based on the Three Principles of the People, in accordance with the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation guidelines, cultivate national morals, provide basic knowledge and skills necessary for life, so as to cultivate civilized and  patriotic citizens. The analysis is as follows: (1) Cultivate children's healthy physique, (2) Cultivate children's good character, (3) Develop children's aesthetic interests, (4) Increase children's knowledge of life, (5) Train children's labor habits, (6) Inspire children's scientific thinking, (7) Cultivate children's spirit of mutual assistance and unity, (8) Cultivate children's concept of patriotism.</p>
<p>(2) Increase Equipment</p>
<p>(1) In addition to sports fields and ordinary study rooms, it is best to set up a farm, factory, pasture, cooking room, sewing room, and cooperative to give children extensive opportunities to practice productive industries. Otherwise, school gardens, workshops, animal breeding centers, home  practice rooms, and small shops should be considered the minimum equipment standards for affiliated elementary schools to implement production education. (2) In addition to the existing equipment for each subject, sufficient equipment should be prepared for natural experiments and all labor education tools to enhance teaching effectiveness. (3) Simple experimental equipment, ordinary animal and plant specimens and models should be used to guide children to make them themselves (i.e., achieve the purpose of knowing through the means of doing). Ordinary mineral specimens should be used to guide children to collect them themselves, and models should be provided to show the entire process. The principle (for example, the coal specimen should not be just a few lumps of coal. The mining, coal seam excavation, and transportation methods should be displayed together to show the entire process). (4) It is best to set up similar  machines to enable children to make daily utensils, repair daily  appliances, and practice a stable skill as the basis for life, which is the best way for affiliated elementary schools to expand their facilities.</p>
<p>(3) Utilize</p>
<p>The production  of the school itself is different depending on the  environment. For example, using  mountains  forests, using  fields, cultivating  plants, using paddy fields, planting rice and wheat, using  to raise, utilizing  adjacent open spaces to plant cotton, vegetables,  seedlings, sugarcane, corn, and potatoes, utilizing ponds, planting  to raise fish, using  farms to raise bees, raising  rabbits, and  sheep and pigs, utilizing workbenches, printing  binding  books, painting appliances, manufacturing children's items,  game equipment, and daily  household  goods, utilizing home  practice rooms, manufacturing school notebooks, clothes, and  Students, refreshments, and other cooperative operations such as shop, food and clothing consumption cooperation, research and improvement of local specialties must be integrated with production education teaching at any time and place, so that children in a pure and natural environment have the opportunity to experience their own simple economic life.</p>
<p>(4) Pay Attention to Labor Training</p>
<p>Labor without production is like  filling hunger with paintings, and production without labor is like quenching thirst with plums. Therefore, labor depends on production, and production is driven by labor.  The scope of labor is defined as follows: (1) In terms of agriculture, it is divided into gardening, farming, and  breeding; (2) In terms of factories, it is divided into specialty crafts (such as Huzhou's silk and Ningbo's  mats, etc.) and weaving, carpentry, earthwork, and gold work, five types (senior students can specialize in one or two types); (3) In terms of health, it is divided into  and relief, and disaster relief two types; (4) Practical operation,  refers to various operations attached to the living environment and career, roughly as follows: (1) Cleaning includes movements such as drawing, washing, and beating; (2) Transportation includes movements such as  loading, pulling, and rowing; (3) Construction includes movements such as excavation, stacking, throwing, and catching; (4) Agriculture includes movements such as reaping,  stepping, and  trampling; (5) Crafts include movements such as chopping, sawing, and weaving; (6) Fire fighting includes movements such as climbing, running, and long-distance running; (7)  includes movements such as mixing, supporting, and carrying; (8) Others include operations in  language, arithmetic, social studies, natural science, and all hand-brain combined movements that have educational meaning.</p>
<p>For the above items, children should be guided to learn from various activities according to their abilities, interests, and actual needs, and to transform children who are rich in imitative and malleable qualities into small farmers and small workers, actively and joyfully.  From  this activity, do not use labor as hard work. In addition to "appreciation" and "research," pay attention to avoiding waste, maintaining order, cultivating mutual assistance, increasing production efficiency, and developing a positive attitude and creativity.</p>
<p>(5) Improve Teaching Methods</p>
<p>(1) The curriculum standards should be based on the Ministry of Education's elementary school curriculum standards and the local special environment, refined teaching materials, and adapted to children's needs; (2) The curriculum standards should be based on the Ministry of Education's general rules for elementary school education, and each subject should be taught with the key teaching principles of "using both hands and brain," "practicing what you preach," and ""; (3) The teaching materials for natural, social, labor,  art, and hygiene subjects must have appropriate organized connections and be designed and taught in large units to break the previous rigid teaching, standard experiments, and interesting practice, so that children can actually participate in the real environment of life, society, and labor around them. In addition to observing with their own eyes, listening with their own ears, and experiencing in person, they must also do it with their own hands. Not only should they do what can be done in labor class, but also what cannot be done in labor class, they should fully try to do it during class time or outside of class time. If there are observation, research, and experimental matters that must go through a long period of time before results can be obtained, children should be guided to do them every day and record the progress every day until there are results to report. (4) Each teacher should provide appropriate guidance and inspection for the work done by children.</p>
<p>(6) Promote Guidance on Further Education and Employment</p>
<p>(1) Each affiliated elementary school should organize a guidance committee for further education and employment, and each teacher should be responsible for group observation, conduct intelligence tests, performance tests, and investigations of family environment and personal aspirations to guide children in further education or employment. (2) Each affiliated elementary school should jointly organize a job placement agency with social education institutions and professional groups to select employment paths for graduates and reduce the hesitation in choosing a career.</p>
<p>(7) Concurrently Conduct Mass Education</p>
<p>(1) Each affiliated elementary school should hold production education symposiums regularly, inviting students' parents, siblings, and neighbors to attend. In addition to lecturing on matters related to production, they may also exhibit or perform on the achievements of production education. (2) Each affiliated elementary school should take its own children as the center and promote children's and youth production competitions in the local area (such as  chicken competitions, egg incubation competitions, fruit and vegetable planting competitions, etc.). (3) Help society destroy enemies and destroy  , eliminate borers and locusts, introduce new agricultural tools, irrigate and instill scientific knowledge, compile specific measures, guide children to help their fathers and brothers in production and employment during holidays, and conduct performance assessments. (4) Each affiliated elementary school may set up women's vocational  tutoring classes to directly improve people's livelihoods and indirectly increase children's happiness. (5) Plan to establish a mobile library on aspects of the people's livelihood. (6) Use spare time on Sundays to carry out oral or written propaganda on aspects of the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>"P&gt; Ministry of Education Political News</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's recent political news is summarized below: (1) Instructing the Jiangxi Education Department to request that the Ministry of Education issue a clear decree stipulating that all middle schools, except for foreign languages, shall not use foreign languages as textbooks is insightful. However, in June 1919, the Ministry of Education ordered the education departments of all provinces and cities to adopt Chinese textbooks for all junior high schools except for foreign language textbooks and not to use foreign language textbooks again. According to the report,  it is ordered to inform. (2) Consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the case of the Indian government cracking down on overseas Chinese schools, it is proposed that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and the Ministry of Education and Foreign Affairs discuss the implementation outline of overseas Chinese education. (3) Instructing the Henan Education Department to approve the provisional measures for revising and rewarding domestic Henan graduate students based on the report for record.</p>

<p>"P&gt; This Year's Annual Meeting of the Chinese Science Society Held in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>Resolved at Yesterday's Board Meeting</p>
<p>Annual Meeting Staff Also Elected</p>
<p>The annual meeting of the Chinese Science Society is held every year in a selected location, with the aim of covering all provinces and cities in the country, not only to allow members to personally visit various places to inspect the actual situation, but also to use this gathering to promote the development of local science and technology, and its impact is significant.

<p>"P&gt; Municipal Education Bureau Holds Seventh Elementary School Teacher Registration Ceremony</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau held the seventh elementary school teacher registration. The names of the qualified personnel were published in the newspaper twice. Except for a few who had incomplete procedures and those who needed to complete graduation procedures retroactively, the supplementary inspection of  documents and the preparation of registration certificates have been completed.  On February 1st, the registration certificate distribution ceremony was held at Wuben Girls' High School. 107 teachers attended the registration. Director Pan chaired the meeting. After reporting on the situation of this registration, Director Pan gave a brief speech, roughly stating that there are more than 110,000 children enrolled in Shanghai, which is only one-tenth of the city's school-age children. More teachers will be needed to add schools in the future. Each should contribute their ability to the elementary school education sector. Those who get a job should try to teach students more and must follow the standard of citizen training promulgated by the Ministry of Education and create students as sound citizens. This training is not only the responsibility of citizen or party  teachers. All teachers should also bear a part of the responsibility.</p>

<p>"P&gt; The Burden of Children</p>
<p>丨A letter from Mr. Fahua in this city</p>
<p>After reading your article "Is My Suicide View Right or Wrong?" in response to Mr. Ren Wangyue, I feel very satisfied. Although I have never thought about suicide, the  you gave him are very correct!</p>
<p>Now I have a problem that has been unresolved for many years, and I hope you will give me a good guide as well.</p>
<p>I have been married for four years. My husband and I do not have the intense love that young men and women have these days, but we both have the will to stand in the ranks of the common people and overthrow the existing bad system and build a rational society. This will binds us firmly together. We want to fight, we want to fight this current society to the death! However, unfortunately! I had just escaped the shackles of my family, and then I fell into the shackles of my children! In three years, we have had two children in succession! In this way, our so-called efforts and struggles, future careers, and struggles against  forces have been largely eliminated by the problems of children and life!</p>
<p>In such a society, there is only one way out: struggle! However, how to struggle? How to solve the problem of children by abandoning them is really difficult to do! Waiting for them to grow up enough and then do other things is even more of a dream! I am suffering every day for this problem, so please give me a  guide!</p>
<p>Answer: After reading your letter three times, I can't help but sigh, and the enthusiasm of the lady and her husband to serve society and  is overflowing. This is also what the reporter admires endlessly. The lady and her husband are burdened by women and cannot fulfill their ambitions. This is the general situation of young men and women today, and it is by no means trivial as it relates to the future of society. The reporter's anger should be divided into two levels of measures. First level: You two should not have any more children from now on, but ladies, please don't misunderstand. The reporter is by no means an ascetic or a follower of pure extinction. It is to persuade people to cut off the inevitable demands of life. It is to persuade both sexes, in addition to solving the sexual desire problem of two people. Don't create any more side problems 丨childbearing. To solve this problem, I would like to introduce the following two books to the lady: (1) Problems of Birth Control (edited by Cheng Hao, published by Yadong Library); (2) Human Sexual Life (edited by the former person, Yadong Edition). Second level: Since the lady and her husband have already had two children, naturally they cannot abandon them. If there is a wealthy family that is old and childless and happy to accept these two children as adopted children, then you should quickly send them to him, and everyone will be "where they should be." If there is no such adventure, then you have to raise them temporarily. Of course, you can also send them to an orphanage. Besides, there is only one way: the lady should sacrifice herself for the time being and ask the lady's husband to seek  a job to make a living, or you two can find a job or other equivalent job. Then put the children in someone else's care or negotiate with the kindergarten specifically and ask them to take care of them. Although it will be a little difficult economically, you two can both free yourselves to work, which will benefit yourselves and society. However, this kind of thing should be handled differently according to each person's environment. What the reporter said is just for reference. And this is not a perfect solution. In short, in today's society, there is no hope of a satisfactory solution to the kind of problem raised by the lady. Speaking of this, it aroused my enthusiasm again; if you two can fight for society and put your own spirit, strength, and love on the suffering masses, then the two children will become secondary or unimportant issues.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Rice Merchants Guild Requests Strict Prohibition of Rice Boat Interception <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai City Bean and Rice Merchants Guild, in a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stated: Petition concerning the interception of rice boats, relying on [force to] commit violence; requesting a swift order for police to prohibit [such actions] and severely punish [the perpetrators]. It is alleged that the guild previously received a letter from the Nanbang rice merchants, stating that rice transported from various ports to Shanghai was being forcibly intercepted en route, preventing [the boats] from sailing to Shanghai. A request for a thorough investigation was duly submitted. Now, it is further alleged that a letter was recently received from Shen Shangwen of Yuanyuyu Company, stating that Zhou Xikui, a boat passenger from Pudong, reported that he and Wang Xiangkui, after unloading cargo in Pudong, were sailing empty boats to Nanlu to load goods. On the morning of the day before yesterday, at eleven o'clock, while passing through the Sishi Shoal of Minhang Town, about twenty or thirty people, resembling bandits, claiming to be from the Chuanbang Lianyi Society, chased after them in two boats. They shouted for [the boats] to stop, wielding sharp weapons, jumped onto the boats, assaulted people, destroyed property, and used a large axe to cut down two masts, injuring five boatmen, some seriously and some lightly. During the chaos, many small items were lost. The boats are now docked in Minhang, and [the incident] has been reported to the Jiangsu Water Police of the First District, stationed there, requesting protection and investigation. Meanwhile, [the injured] have gone to the hospital for treatment. It is also heard that those people are still gathering in groups, entrenched in Minhang, deliberately making trouble for boatmen. It is said that the district office has seized a small motorboat, also allegedly belonging to members of the society. Although Zhou Xikui and Wang Xiangkui are not rice merchant passengers, they were still intercepted by members of the Chuanbang Lianyi Society while sailing empty boats from Pudong, and [the society] even dared to injure people and destroy property. Such reliance on [force for] rampant wrongdoing shows a complete disregard for the law. If not urgently admonished and stopped, the situation will escalate, disrupting public order without end. Your esteemed council has always been the leader in rice matters, and even if not for the sake of the rice boats, [you] should consider the livelihood and lives of the people and provide assistance. How can such a disregard for the law and a trend of heinous crimes be ignored and overlooked? Is it because the people of Shanghai will not die from Japanese bullets, but rather be allowed to starve to death? Our guild, in a state of terror, cannot but write this letter to earnestly request upholding justice and providing swift assistance. Given this, it is our opinion that the Lianyi Society, in broad daylight, dares to gather thugs, wield sharp weapons, forcibly intercept rice boats, and injure boatmen. This kind of brutal behavior shows a complete disregard for the law. Moreover, Shanghai is not a rice-producing region, and the entire city's food supply depends on supplies from various ports. If [we] allow gang members to run rampant and intercept boats, the source of rice boats will be cut off, plunging the people of Shanghai into starvation. Regarding public safety, what can be imagined? Therefore, on behalf of the boatmen, we sincerely implore your esteemed council to swiftly submit [this matter] to the Party and government agencies, beseeching them to consider the food supply and lives of the people and boatmen, and to order the military and police to urgently drive out the violent bandits and rescue the intercepted boats, in order to maintain the food supply and secure society. At the same time, it is also reported that two rice-laden boats belonging to Dacheng Company, one detained in Minhang and one in Shagang, etc. Such violence, if not swiftly curbed and severely punished, will deprive rice merchants of their security, and the food supply for the entire city will be immediately affected. Public safety is critically involved, and we are urgently submitting [this report] to the military government, requesting swift and urgent prohibition and strict investigation, in order to punish the violent criminals and protect the good people, so that the law can be upheld and society can maintain order. Approaching the paper, we are filled with urgent anticipation.</p>

The western section of the dredging project has been underway for many days.

<p>Two Workers Injured in the Outcome</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Money and Rice Were Retrieved</p>
<p>The Shishan Branch of the Ta Jia disaster relief association in Dachang East City, and the Dachang Office are currently rushing to build workshops and repair roads. There are many workers under its command. The day before yesterday (the 1st) was originally the date for distributing wages. Bandits knew that there would be a large sum of money, so at twelve o'clock at night, they gathered about twenty people and opened the back door of the accounting room, intending to enter and rob it. However, only the young apprentice Zhao Zigao, eighteen years old, and Wang Yougen, twenty-two years old, local residents, were sleeping in the accounting room. After the bandits broke in, they immediately attacked Zhao and others with iron and wooden sticks and bricks, hitting their heads, faces, waists, and backs, causing them to bleed profusely. They immediately fell on the bed, unconscious. Then, they rummaged through chests and boxes, looting recklessly. Unexpectedly, the accountant Zhu [something] had not yet returned from Shanghai to retrieve the money, and there was no large sum of money in the accounting room. As a result, they only robbed Zhu's two trunks, containing one hundred silver dollars, a fur robe, a coat, and many other clothes, as well as twelve cotton quilts belonging to the staff, worth about six hundred dollars in total. After the bandits robbed [these items], they fled. When the two workers woke up and shouted for help, the town's public security bureau and security team were notified and rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already disappeared. The two injured apprentices were sent to the town's [something] Hospital for treatment. However, their injuries were severe, and it is unknown whether their lives can be saved.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Kidnapping Ring Leader Fang Yunlong Captured <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Female Bandit Also Arrested Simultaneously</p>
<p>Fang Yunlong, a native of Shaoxing, is a well-known kidnapping ring leader in Shaoxing. He has repeatedly committed kidnapping and extortion in Shaoxing and Shanghai. The Shaoxing Public Security Bureau has repeatedly issued arrest warrants, but has been unable to capture him. Recently, Fang suddenly came to Shanghai from Shaoxing. The Shaoxing authorities requested Lu Liankui, the chief Chinese detective of the Shanghai Municipal Police of the Public Concession, to assist in the investigation and arrest. Detective Lu constantly instructed his subordinates to pay close attention to the search and arrest. Until yesterday, detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, and Shao Jingfan learned of Fang's whereabouts and rushed to No. 79 Wuding Road, where they arrested Fang. Then, at No. 8 Changshao Road, they arrested Wang Juhua, a female accomplice and native of Shaoxing. It was learned that Fang and his accomplices had recently kidnapped a young hostage in Hangzhou, and all expenses were provided by Wang. They then searched for the location where the hostage was being held, but Fang's accomplices had already fled upon hearing the news. The two suspects, Fang and Wang, were separately detained. This morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the police had notified the Shaoxing authorities to come to Shanghai to take custody of the suspects, and that further investigation was needed. Therefore, they had not yet formally filed charges, but requested detention in accordance with Article 17 of the Criminal Procedure Law. However, Fang Yunlong had previously committed kidnapping, possession of bombs, and other crimes, and had been repeatedly punished by the court, as evidenced by records. Wang had also been arrested by the police two years ago for kidnapping and transferred to the Zhejiang authorities for interrogation. Last year, she was again discovered by the General Patrol Room for a theft case, but was released by the court due to insufficient evidence. Therefore, the conduct of Fang and Wang is well known, and detention should be granted, [for] one week. Detective Liu then submitted a report detailing the circumstances of the arrest. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, reviewed the report and briefly questioned Fang and Wang, granting approval for detention for one week for further interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Female Corpse Discovered While Fishing <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>A Shocking Corpse Inside a Large Sack</p>
<p>In a large pond in Dongwangjiazhai, Ningguo Road, Huangxing Road, Yangshupu, Pudong, due to recent rains, the water has accumulated greatly, and there are also fish and shrimp. Shandong people often go there to cast nets and fish. However, the day before yesterday afternoon, they caught a large hemp sack, suspecting it contained valuables. Upon opening it, they found a female corpse inside. The corpse was about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, wearing a silk shirt and velvet pants. However, a pair of stone [something] was still tied to the sack. It was determined that the female corpse had been strangled to death and placed in the sack, tied with heavy stones, intending to submerge it in the pond to decompose naturally. After the fishermen discovered it, they were greatly shocked and reported it to the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District, which immediately investigated the case and searched for the murderer. Yesterday, they ordered the local guarantor Zhou Xiaodi to report it to the local court for autopsy. The court has already appointed Prosecutor Yang and others to the scene to conduct the autopsy, confirming that she was murdered. It was ordered that photographs be taken and the body collected by [something], pending the arrest and investigation of the murderer.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Zheng Chunming Steals Funds from French Consulate <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Dismissed from His Mother's Job</p>
<p>Stole Large Sums and Was Eventually Arrested</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month, a theft occurred in the residence of Deputy Consul Li Fu (transliteration) on the upper floor of the French Consulate in Nanjing. A total of 1,060 yuan was lost (purely banknotes of five yuan each from the Bank of China). Deputy Consul Li discovered that it was stolen by Zheng Chunming, a servant of his, who had fled to Shanghai with the stolen goods on the Ruhe Steamboat of the Chahe Company. He immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, requesting them to pay attention to the pursuit and arrest, and describing Zheng's appearance: about twenty years old, wearing a black wool coat, a leather hat, and a scar on his forehead. Hong, the section chief of the Bureau's Second Section, immediately notified the Water Patrol Team to conduct a strict search and arrest. Li, the deputy captain of the team, led detectives and Cheng Xiqing and Zhang Kefeng, the police chief, to the Yihe Wharf in Hongkou at about 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. Seeing that the Ruhe Steamboat had arrived, they immediately boarded the ship. However, Zheng had already landed and checked into a hotel. They then tracked him down to the hotel. According to the hotel staff, a person matching that description had indeed checked into Room 18, but had gone out for a stroll and would return shortly. They waited there. At about 9:00 PM, Zheng arrived. They immediately rushed forward and arrested him. Knowing that he had been discovered, Zheng had no choice but to surrender. They found 60 yuan in stolen money on his person. After searching his room, they found another 175 yuan in stolen money in a pillow inside his bedding. A total of 235 yuan in banknotes was recovered. The whereabouts of the remaining missing amount is unknown. They took the suspect and the stolen goods to the team. During the preliminary interrogation by Chief Zhu, Zheng Chunming confessed that he was 29 years old and worked as a servant in the French Consulate in the capital. He initially worked in the office, but last year Deputy Consul Li transferred him to the upper floor to perform miscellaneous tasks in his residence. His mother, Hai, 55 years old, worked as a nanny in the home of French Consul Borongde (transliteration). His wife, Zhao, 18 years old, lived with him at No. 18 Hehui Street, Sanpailou, Nanjing. Recently, Consul Bo dismissed his mother due to her old age. His mother was angry and fell ill in bed. He was unable to serve her morning and evening due to his job, which he deeply regretted. He also thought that Deputy Consul Li was temperamental and often scolded him for no reason. He recently heard that Deputy Consul Li was about to return to his country, and his position might not last long. If he could obtain a large sum of money, he could enjoy a comfortable life forever. Therefore, at about 3:00 AM on the 28th of last month, taking advantage of his master's unpreparedness, he secretly stole a large stack of banknotes from the desk in his residence. Due to panic, he did not count the amount at the time, but hid it in the pillow and rolled it into the bedding, leaving only 100 dollars for travel expenses. He then took the bedding and a hand-held rattan basket, sneaked out of the consulate, rushed to the riverbank, bought a ticket from the China Travel Service, and boarded the Ruhe Steamboat to Shanghai. He planned to stay for a few days and then notify his family to return to their hometown to avoid being employed again. When the steamboat arrived, he landed and went to the hotel to rest briefly. He went out to buy a set of sanitary shirts and pants, a wool hat, and a pair of shoes, and took them to the bathroom to wash and dress. He then returned to the hotel with his old leather hat and other items. He went out again, went to a restaurant for a meal, and then went to the Great World for a tour. Upon returning to the hotel, he was arrested. He prepared a document and submitted it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification and approval at about 1:00 PM yesterday.</p>

<p>Representative Mou Mo of the Pingjin Education Association</p>
<p>Reported at the City Principals Conference Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau convened a conference of all school principals in the city at its auditorium at 10:00 AM yesterday. Director Pan of the Education Bureau and over 300 principals from various schools attended. First, Director Pan introduced Mou Mo, a representative of the Pingjin National Institutions of Higher Learning Faculty and Staff Association. Then, Mr. Mou reported on the situation, in addition to the situation of the frontline inspection, and the items needed at the front, which has been reported in various newspapers. The following is a record of the anti-Japanese salvation situation in the Pingjin education sector:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Work of the Education Association The Pingjin National Institutions of Higher Learning Faculty and Staff Association has been established for many years and has a very sound organization. Each year, the association fees exceed 1,000 yuan. After the loss of Yuguan, the Pingjin education sector, aware of the panic among the people of Pingjin and the dispersal of students from various schools, urgently sought ways to provide relief. Seven representatives were sent to the front line to distribute 600 yuan worth of comfort items and inspect the actual situation. After the inspection, they deeply understood that the anti-Japanese spirit of our army was reliable, but the material needs were quite urgent. They returned to Ping and promoted [this information] to the public to jointly find ways to provide relief. The Education Association itself deducted 20% of each person's salary, totaling 72,000 yuan, which was remitted to the front line. It also obtained 36 trucks. The Pingda Institute of Technology manufactured 20,000 steel [something] and 30,000 sets of gas masks, all of which have been distributed to various armies.</p>
<p>Elementary School Students Voluntarily Donate Money The most noteworthy aspect of the anti-Japanese work in the Pingjin education sector is the voluntary donation of money by elementary school students. After the Education Association's inspection representatives returned to Ping and reported, the students of various elementary schools convened the Beijing Elementary School Students Federation and decided to request the school authorities of each school to set up a savings box, in which the students of each elementary school would save their spare fruit and money daily and deposit it in the savings box. After it was full, it would be remitted to the anti-Japanese army. As soon as this proposal was made, the schools rushed to prepare [savings boxes]. Each school's savings box was filled in less than two weeks, mostly with copper coins, followed by silver coins. Although the amount was small, it came from the patriotic enthusiasm of the elementary school students and was commendable.</p>
<p>Various Schools Return to Their Original State After the loss of Yuguan, the various schools in Pingjin fell into a state of great chaos, and students dropped out of school. Recently, after the Education Association's inspection representatives returned to Ping, they have returned to their original state and strictly stipulated a rule that any student who does not register within one month of the start of the school term will be expelled. Therefore, in addition to a small number of students who withdrew from school, three-quarters of the students enrolled at the beginning of the current semester have already registered.</p>
<p>Organize the National Education Association Our education sector personnel are intellectual [something] and should be stable, attend classes as usual, and lead the people of all circles to unite in resisting Japan and saving the country. The mission of these representatives in going to the various provinces is to report on the situation of the line, and the biggest request is to contact the education circles in various places and organize a national education association. The most suitable location for this is Shanghai, and a branch will be established in each place. This association will devote all its efforts to leading all sectors in resisting Japan and saving the country during the national crisis, and will study academics in peacetime to develop China's education profession.</p>

<h3 id="e117">The Transfer Issue of the Old Site of the County Education Bureau <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Consulted Once Yesterday Without Result</p>
<p>Shang Women's Elementary School Has Prepared to Build a School Building</p>
<p>After the Shanghai County Education Bureau moved to its new location, the old site on Shangwen Road has been transferred to the Municipal Education Bureau. The transfer was originally scheduled to be completed yesterday. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Education Bureau, and the County Education Bureau sent representatives to consult, but because the Municipal Finance Bureau did not send a representative to the meeting, the issue of subsidies was not resolved, so the transfer was postponed to a later date. It was decided that the old site of the bureau would be used as the school building for Shangwen Elementary School.

<h3 id="e122">Flavored Dragon Beetles and Others <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>On North Szechuan Road, one can see a kind of black, hard-shelled insect sold in Cantonese stores, placed in glass bottles alongside items like "duck gizzards and livers." They are called "Flavored Dragon Beetles." (The name itself is quite flavorful!) Let me tell you, they are delicious! They are sold at Wing On Company's confectionery department for sixty cents a pound. Cantonese people call cockroaches (i.e., oil bugs) [ka zha]. It is said that these dragon beetles are "water ka zha." I haven't been able to find out their scientific name; please advise. In any case, they are six-legged beetles that live in rice paddies, with hairy legs like duck webs. They are caught in the summer, seasoned with "flavored" ingredients, stir-fried until dry, and called flavored dragon beetles. When eating, the legs and shells are removed, and they taste fragrant and salty like peanuts, but with a slight "ka zha" musty flavor. To think that people eat things like this, the Cantonese are truly unbelievable.</p>
<p>A year ago, there was a Japanese performer at the Great World who specialized in eating poisonous insects, especially toads, centipedes, and spiders, causing onlookers to gasp in amazement. I think this is nothing strange. Japanese people are born with monkey-like stomachs that can be filled with anything. A wandering monk can travel all over the island nation eating grass roots and mustard seeds with a small bundle on his back. Compared to them, the Cantonese are just a little more "civilized." Cantonese people eat snakes, rats, turtles, and crabs, with the most poisonous being the most superior. There is also "He Worm." These are basically the same as dung maggots. They are about the size of yellow bean sprouts, colorful, and live in rice paddies. A bowl full of them wriggles and moves. When chopped with a cleaver, the cutting board is full of pulp. When cooked, they resemble crab roe. Otherwise, they can be fried in their original form. If you ask the hundreds of thousands of Cantonese people in Shanghai whether they prefer crab roe or He Worm, they will say, "Ah! There's simply no comparison." But in reality, in Shanghai, they can only eat some "sun-dried He Worm."</p>

<p>Gold Prices Rise for Six Consecutive Days</p>
<p>The Fore Market Was Extremely Tense, but the After Market Became Relaxed</p>
<p>No Formal Transactions for Spot and Forward Swaps</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London spot and forward prices both decreased by 0.0625, New York silver prices remained unchanged, British-American exchange rates decreased by half a point, American-British exchange rates decreased by 1.25 points, and forward silver prices decreased by a little over 2%, but the December rate decreased by only 3 cents. Bank telegrams decreased by 0.1875. The opening was good but not strong, at 772.4 taels, first at 2.2 taels. The exchange market opened with sterling flat and the US dollar tight, so it gradually rose. Although it fluctuated several times, the trend was still upward. HSBC's posted rates first lowered both the sterling and US dollar rates by 0.125, rising to 8 taels. At this time, the US dollar for June was traded at 29.125 yuan in the exchange market. Soon, this price became difficult to sell, so it retreated by 2 taels, to 6 taels, but it was still able to rise again. Andar bought the June US dollar at 0.125. People were generally optimistic, and retail investors also poured in, so it suddenly rose to 8.88 taels before stopping. The exchange market was slightly flat, and retail investors divested. Foreign dispatches also reported on financial turmoil in the United States, with banks suspending withdrawals, and various unfavorable rumors. People's confidence suddenly weakened, falling to 5 taels. The noon closing was 775.9 taels. The afternoon opening was 775.8 taels. There were very few transactions, and the market was even flatter. At first, it lingered around 6 taels for a long time, and people's confidence remained stable, but because the banks' appetite was not good, it fell to 5 taels. After that, the domestic market showed a glimmer of light, and buyers became bold, with news of the Central Bank opening for cash withdrawals coming. For a time, buying interest was extremely strong in the market, rising sharply to 8.5 taels. However, because the exchange market was still loose, it did not improve, and the downstream was seen. Banks were selling, and it fell further to around 6 taels. The closing was 777.1 taels. There were few formal transactions for spot and forward swaps. The spot price was calculated to increase by 12 taels, and there were no substantial positions for forward swaps in March and April. This was because the spot holdings of various spot firms were also thin, but the premium was generally still outside 2 taels. Short positions, such as Sweden, still had a small number that had not been swapped. The morning was extremely tense, because the exchange rate and gold price were both good. The afternoon was not good. Although the market sentiment was good, the domestic market in the banks was bleak. The day's market conditions will now be recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 771.4 taels, an increase of 1.3 taels compared to the previous closing. The opening price was 2.1 taels, so it was first at 2 taels.

Pan Gen bought the June US dollar at 29.25 yuan, and Hengxing Yuanmao Yong also bought at low prices, rising to 4.2 taels. Soon, it retreated a few cents, but the buying momentum was still strong. Zhifeng Yong also entered, rising to 5 taels. The June US dollar at 0.1875 was bought up aggressively by Mitsui. Daxing Yong even advanced to over 6 taels, reaching 6.5 taels, lingering slightly around 6 taels. However, because of the trend of common prosperity, after 5.8 taels, buyers surged again. Fuyu went to the market to purchase bars, and it was 6.5 taels. Zhongfu also bought the June US dollar at 0.1875. Datongcheng and Fuyu continued to advance. HSBC's posted rates revealed that the US dollar had shrunk by 0.125, and at this time it rose to 8 taels. Hengxing sold off, and Citibank also dumped the April US dollar at 0.75, at a price of around 7 taels, but because Unicom had accepted the June US dollar at 0.125, the market situation was still calm. When this price became difficult to sell in June, Qian Changxiang sold to within 7 taels. Yuanmao Yongfu Chang all sold, and it was 6 taels. At this time, Datongcheng bought, so it hovered between 6 and 7 taels for a long time, and was quiet for a long time. The buying momentum was strong again, and Datongcheng and Fuyu advanced again, adding to 8 taels. Yuanshengyong took advantage of the high price to sell off, gradually retreating to around 6 taels. Fuyu successfully advanced slightly, to around 7 taels. Andar took in the June US dollar at 0.125. Datongcheng came to purchase aggressively, and suddenly jumped to 8.88 taels. The bank's domestic market trended flat, so the price of the June US dollar at 0.125 could be settled. The gold price also trended downstream. Yuanmao Yong slightly sold, and Yuanshengyong still came to sell, falling to within 8 taels. Retail investors also saw high prices and rushed to sell bars, so they continued to see a downward trend. The March US dollar at 0.625 was not easy to sell. Chunyuanyong also sold, retreating to 6 taels. Goods also came to cash out at 5.6 taels. After that, it was extremely peaceful, with only a few cents of rise and fall, hovering around 6 taels. After entering, because Hengxing came to advance, it began to add to 6.5 taels. After staying for a long time, finally Daxing Yong and others came to sell off, and people's hearts were already wilting due to the panic in the American banking sector, and they came even lower, falling to 5 taels. However, the exchange market was calm, so it was pulled up by ten or so. The noon closing was 775.9 taels, and the price of goods was 6.2 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 775.8 taels, and the price of goods was 5.9 taels. Yifengyong slightly accepted, and for a time the trend was extremely stable, and it rose by one tael. However, because Wanxing came to sell, the downstream was seen. However, it hovered around 6 taels. When Citibank dumped the April US dollar at 0.8125, Datongcheng came to sell bars, although the amount was not large, but because there were limited opponents in the market, retail investors quoted, and it fell to 5 taels. Goods came to purchase for hedging, so they hovered and rose. At this time, Zhaofengchang came to sell off, but because Tongfengheng and others accepted it, there was no decline. Transactions were few, and the market was also still at 5.5 taels. When Shunli goods came to advance, they rose to around 6 taels. People's hearts were very stable. After that, Shunli suddenly came to sell off, and Fuyu also sold, slightly seeing a return.

Fuchang came to advance, rising to 8 taels. The April 0.75 bank made a deal, although it was not tight, the gold price still rose. The news of the Central Bank opening for cash withdrawals suddenly spread, and Qian Changxiang came to purchase bars aggressively, and it rose to 8.5 taels. Unlike the exchange market, which did not improve, it turned downstream. Citibank also dumped the June US dollar at 0.1875. Zhifeng Yongfu Taiheng all came to sell off, retreating to within 7 taels, slightly still. Transactions were light. Although people's hearts were good, because the exchange market and banks were selling, the market was suppressed for a long time. Zhaofengchang Baohou suddenly advanced, and a slight rise was seen, reaching 7.5 taels. Shanghai dumped April 0.875. Zhifeng Yong came to sell again. After several struggles, it still fell to 6.1 taels. Goods came to purchase for hedging, and it rose by two or so, extending to a closing of 777.1 taels. After the closing, there were quite a few retail investors who purchased. Zhifeng Yong came to advance a very small number, but it was still pushed to over 7.5 taels.

As a result, it rose by 6 taels compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The revealed price was due to HSBC's posted rate of the US dollar shrinking by 0.125, calculated at 28.25 yuan, and the alloy price was 849.56 taels. In terms of the closing price, it was about 72 taels, a decrease of about 2 taels compared to the previous closing.

<p>The spot swap market was extremely flat yesterday, with few transactions. The transactions in the market were only made by Yingfengheng and Dafengheng, who did each other a favor. The calculation was to increase by 12 taels.</p>
<p>There were few counterparties for forward swaps. The shorts were silent because there were no counterparties, and the spot firms were quiet because of the small amount of goods, so no transactions were seen. Prices had to be slightly more expensive than the previous few days. Generally, it was not easy to swap in within three taels. There were only seven public orders for March, with seven orders released by Bingxing and Hengyu receiving them.</p>

After opening, it gradually tightened. The June US dollar was made from 29.25 yuan to 0.125, because HSBC posted sterling and US dollar rates were both small at 0.125 and more favorable. The noon closing was slightly flat and loose. There were very few transactions in the afternoon, but the market was not good, and the bank's appetite trended tight. However, because the gold market was still stable, it was pulled up slightly, and the near-term price at the close was calculated at 1 shilling 8 pence 1.125, and the US dollar was 28.625, but this price had a 0.0625 rise and fall, and 0.6875 had the possibility of being settled, because there were few transactions at the close and it was a little dazed.

<p>The early and late prices of the discount were equal</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign discount still had a market price, comparable to the previous day, but transactions were still small and sparse. However, banks were filled with a desire for gains, and there was no opportunity to buy. As a result, the closing time was not very and the number of people was not as large as in the past. The state of the silver market had no opportunity to be tight at present, so there was no tightness or looseness to record.</p>
<p>The situation of the discount was that the "foreign discount" was still 7 mace 1 fen 4 li 7 hao and a half due to the few transactions in the early market. There was no change in the afternoon market, which was also comparable to the early market. The "silver discount" was also 2 fen in the early market, with the first cut adding water by 34 fen.

<p>Securities The situation in Rehe changed dramatically</p>
<p>Public debt rose gradually</p>
<p>The war went against the debt market</p>
<p>The mentality of speculators can be seen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt market on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange suddenly became lively, and market prices also turned active, reversing the sluggishness of the previous two days. Because the situation in Rehe suddenly changed dramatically, and the situation in Tianjin and Hebei may be fortunate enough to be avoided, the market sentiment thought that the war may therefore reduce its scope. The short positions in the market suddenly became unstable, and the opening in the morning immediately had short covering, with the troop reduction suddenly rising by 7 jiao. The northern gangs, such as No. 21 and No. 14, all had covering. The second round of retail investors also rose to buy, and large investors also had short covering, rising by 35 jiao, and the situation was extremely strong. In the afternoon, news was known that the changes in Rehe were very rapid, and Chifeng Jianping was in danger. However, the mentality of speculators was just the opposite, so in the two rounds in the afternoon, the northern gangs, No. 5, No. 7, No. 32, etc., all had purchases, and market prices gradually rose, each round rising by about half a yuan. The whole-day trend, from beginning to end, completely trended upward, and there were no weak signs in the middle. Therefore, the result was that all prices rose compared to the previous day. The Eighteen Customs rose the least, also rising by 7 jiao. The troop reduction actually rose by more than 2 yuan, and the rest also rose by about 1.5 yuan. The trend went against the advantages and disadvantages of the war. The speculative mentality can be known from this. The total number of transactions for the whole day was more lively, totaling 6,669,500 yuan. The internal calculation of the spot was 5,000 yuan. The futures salt tax was the most, accounting for 1.54 million. The troop reduction was also the second most, accounting for 1.3 million. The consolidated tax was 1.1 million, and the rest were mostly over 500,000.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</p>
<p>New Fung &amp; Co. reported that the New York stock market continued to rise on Wednesday. The morning opening was weak, but later, because the House of Representatives passed the Laggedy Mac bankruptcy debt amendment, the market situation turned strong. The railway industry benefited the most from the amendment, which allowed companies unable to repay their debts to be reorganized instead of being liquidated. President-elect Roosevelt stated that he would discuss the national banking turmoil with the next Treasury Secretary, and it is generally expected that he will convene a special meeting on March 20 to discuss various emergency bills, so people's confidence is improving. However, the banking turmoil has not yet subsided, so the notice was given that the loan rate has now increased from 1% interest to 2%. Renewals are still 1%, and 60-day and 90-day terms are 2.5%. Bank bills rose to 1%, the highest interest rate since April 8 last year. Congress has passed Smith's bill to raise cotton prices, which is related to promoting improved banking laws. A total of 790,000 shares were traded today. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>The yarn and cotton market was lackluster</p>
<p>The yarn market is still flat. Due to the depletion of finance and the decline of commerce in all directions, all gangs have no purchasing power at this time of spring sales. In addition, the situation is chaotic, and people's hearts are particularly weak. According to a partial survey, the yarn inventories of various factories are increasing day by day, and the yarn from yarn factories in North China is being transported to Shanghai for dumping, so from a general point of view, the yarn market is particularly difficult to trend high.</p>
<p>The human standard is flat</p>
<p>The human standard opened in the pre-market, and although American cotton rose, the market sentiment was extremely weak. Due to the lack of buyers, the prices of each month fell slightly by 1.2 qian. The market situation was slightly softer in the afternoon, and the news was not good, falling by 1.2 qian. However, August rose by 2 qian. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 11,400 bales.

<p>The cotton market is quiet, and the trend is still hard. Because the amount absorbed by the bulls is not released and American cotton is rising again, the buying power is quite strong. However, the domestic situation is chaotic, and the Japanese army is invading even more, yarn sales have stagnated, and the factories are in a difficult position. They refuse to purchase high-priced raw materials, and the selling price of Indian cotton is cheaper, so the market price of spot cotton in Shandong, Tianjin, and other places is loose and falls.

<p>American Proposal to Limit Cotton Production</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, January 1: Today, the Senate has agreed to the Smith Cotton Production Management Bill passed by the House of Representatives. The bill has now been sent to the President's office for consideration by President Hoover, but whether he is willing to approve it is still in question. The main purpose of the bill is to reduce American cotton production in 1933. Food After the strike, the rice market saw a tightening trend.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the shipowners' strike had not been resolved, and there were no arrivals at all.</p>
<p>Only a small amount of goods remained in the warehouse in Pudong, and the situation was cold and tight. Factory goods took the opportunity to be released, but there were not many transactions, and prices were unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the dispute over light and heavy bushels had not been resolved, resulting in few arrivals.</p>
<p>Warehouse goods continued to be sold, and the white japonica stores had a slight appetite, tightening by about two corners. The thin japonica early rice was settled, the Dujian was of considerable length, and the American japonica was tight. The wharf japonica and</p>
<p>customer japonica were settled and stable, the Yin Yuan was fair, and the Bai Yuan was slightly soft.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Xian continued to arrive at the port</p>
<p>The main street turned weak... The Fujian office suddenly became greedy</p>
<p>Yesterday, the appetite for customer Xian on the main street was still flat, but Jiangbei customer Xian gradually had hope of coming to Shanghai, and the market turned weak. However, the Fujian office suddenly became greedy, and the market was still able to stabilize. After the Shanghai price of Hunan and Jiangxi goods had fallen flat, the source gradually moved away. After this, there may not be many goods arriving in Shanghai. The Jiangbei goods that arrived a few days ago can all be combined and planned. The vendors already had the intention of activity. A new batch of goods arrived yesterday, totaling 500 bags, which were advanced by the main street, priced at 7.5 yuan, 1 jiao 5 fen smaller than the Jiangyan goods sold last week. Today, the arrival of goods is booming. If there is no large-scale digestion, the market may have to be viewed as small. The main street also went to Jiangxi and put out 130 bags in the evening, priced at 8.5 to 2 jiao. Also, 100 bags of Ji Yuan were priced at 9.7 to 4 jiao, 150 bags of Hunan Ji Jiang rice were priced at 8.3 to 2 jiao, and 200 bags of Shajiang rice were priced at 7.3 to 1 fen. The Fuzhou office went to Hunan rough Jiang rice at 1,023 bags,</p>

<p>A Sluggish Friendly Match</p>
<p>Lancashire Wins Over Youyou</p>
<p>| Result: 5 to 2 |</p>
<p>Both Sides Penalized Two Penalty Kicks Each</p>
<p>Lancashire, which once lost 4-1 to Youyou, met Youyou again yesterday in a friendly match at the China Baseball Field. There were also thousands of spectators. Just because the weather had cleared not long ago and the field was not dry, both sides found it difficult to attack and defend. What was even more ridiculous was that in the 90 minutes of the game, there were as many as four penalty kicks, which shows that the players have completely changed their usual state. The Lancashire team seemed more willing to hustle than Youyou. In the first half, the fire was blazing, often making the Youyou defenders flustered. Old man Hui Sheng is old, and he shares the same sympathy with Huang Ruihua.</p>
<p>In the first half, as soon as the short soldiers met, after three or five rounds, the five forwards of the Lancashire team spied east and west. Fortunately, Wang Shusen and Yao Xiao, etc., had meritorious service in rescuing the king, and there were no mistakes for as long as ten minutes. In the end, Landon dribbled the ball north, and Hu Mao followed behind him. In an instant, he broke into the important pass. Old man Hui Sheng was tripped and fell. Seeing the critical situation, Mao Honggui rushed to intercept, but unexpectedly, his behavior was improper and he was penalized with an eleven-meter penalty. Klausley kicked the ball in. Youyou lost this unexpected goal, which aroused the anger of the entire army, and they continued to pounce fiercely on the enemy's defense, but all of them were off by a hair. And Hu Mao went straight in with a single knife, Wang Shusen could not turn around in time, Mao Honggui was really a troublemaker, and he was furious and ruined. He rushed to the front of the door, the ball had arrived, Wang Cai Gao ran out, and Mao Honggui actually used his hands and feet again and was penalized with a twelve-meter penalty, which was kicked in by Swaine. In the melee, Hu Mao made another contribution with a long pass from Klausley. Xi Qiaosheng dribbled the ball into the enemy's inner defense and tripped to the ground. The referee did not deceive anyone and also announced a twelve-meter penalty. Sun Tie Tui swept it in easily. At the end of the first half, under the urging of Landon for the fifth time, he scored another goal.</p>
<p>In the second half, Youyou made a major adjustment of personnel. Shi Hou'er replaced Mao Honggui, and Qian Yaobin replaced Hui Sheng. The back defense seemed to be consolidated, but the attack was unfavorable and lost a good opportunity. Chen Yaoshu led the troops to spy on several occasions, but failed midway because the rear team was not available. The locomotive refused to give up and echoed with Sun Tie Tui from a distance, shooting directly at the goal. Swaine knew the law and broke the law, and was sentenced to death again (twelve-meter penalty). Sun Tie Tui was familiar with the road and scored another goal. At this time, Landon rushed into the hinterland and shot in a goal. Before long, the battle situation also ended. Youyou lost with a score of two to five.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Otter's Puppet State <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>A certain surname in Suzhou repaired the stone revetment behind his house. Before the craftsmen had dismantled even half of it, they suddenly discovered a small round pond with a diameter of about two feet. It contained several small fish, swimming freely and happily. A gentle breeze blew across the water, actually creating ripples. Where did the fish come from? Where did the water come from? This aroused the surprise of many workers and onlookers.</p>
<p>If the fish came from the river, this small round pond was five or six feet above the river surface. The fish didn't have wings, so how could they have flown here? As for the source of the water, it was even more incredible. This was accumulated water. It hadn't rained for half a month. Where did the water come from to accumulate in the small pond? Just as they were all guessing, an old farmer happened to pass by and said with a smile, "This is a common thing in the countryside. Digging up a small</p>
<p>fish pond means you can definitely dig up an otter den. Probably this revetment has been around for many years, and there is already an otter den inside. Near the otter den, it must have dug a small pond, drawing clean water from the pond and spitting it into the pond. It also brings small fish into the pond, raising them all year round. When the otter wants to eat fish but is too lazy to go into the water to catch them, it provides the small fish it raises nearby for its food. So, knowing that there is a small fish pond nearby, there must be an otter den." Everyone listened with a mixture of doubt and belief. After continuing to dismantle, they indeed discovered a nest. Although they didn't see an otter, they saw otter fur left in the nest, which confirmed the old farmer's experience.</p>
<p>A pond is originally the kingdom of fish, but this small round pond with a diameter of two feet, arranged by the otter, can only be said to be a pseudo-state organized by the otter | a puppet state. Why does the otter organize this puppet state? It turns out it's to provide food for the otter itself. It's pitiful that these several small fish, about to die, are still happily swimming inside, forgetting that the otter is nearby. Sooner or later, they will become the otter's snack! Comparing the small to the large, this is called the Eastern Otter's Manchurian Fish.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Reflections on Iron Birds from Kites <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>| So Different from This Day Last Year |</p>
<p>In this time of delightful spring and gentle breezes, as long as you go to play in the countryside, you will always find many lively children flying kites on the open fields covered with green grass. Holding one end of the string, swaying with the wind, the kite, heavier than air, slowly rises. Its situation in the air, I can quote two ancient sentences to describe it, which is what Su Dongpo said: "Vast and boundless, as if riding the wind in emptiness, not knowing where it will stop; drifting and fluttering, as if detached from the world and independent, ascending to immortality." It is truly a worthwhile toy to appreciate!</p>
<p>Thinking back to this day last year. In the sky above Shanghai, no matter whether it was in South Shanghai, Zhabei, the suburbs, or the four villages, where could you see the shadow of kites? Our airspace was filled with the iron birds of the Rising Sun. As long as you heard the grinding sound; and the hovering in twos and threes, the god of terror, the god of destruction, the god of death, these many gods were about to descend! In principle, they come with birds, we go with birds, and we can also show our skills in the air. It's a pity that our iron birds, presumably because their feathers were not fully grown, hid without a trace like kites.</p>
<p>Now, this year, a corner of Shanghai is temporarily at peace. The kites played by children are displaying their style in the sky like stars spread across the sky. However, I hope that next time something happens, our pure white iron birds will be as many as kites. Don't hide in the nest again and be killed like a tiger.</p>
<p>Thinking of iron birds from kites really makes people both cry and laugh. Finally, I also have some small feelings about the evolution of kites.</p>
<p>Some people say that the creation of kites was invented by Han Xin to scout Chu soldiers. There is no record in the official history, I think it is the words of unofficial historians! There is also a record in Du Yi Zhi saying, "Hou Jing besieged Taicheng, and Jianwen released kites to outside the city to ask for reinforcements."</p>
<p>Reading the above legend, it is already known that kites also have the reconnaissance function of iron birds, but in the past they were simpler! Kites have been invented for thousands of years, and they are still like this. The great powers are desperately building iron birds, we must not look at the kites being played and mistakenly think they are our own iron birds!</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Authority of the Residual Flames <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhihen</p>
<p>| Destroyed Xiao Xin'an |</p>
<p>Ms. Xiao Xin'an of Yixing burned herself to death in Nanyang. "Her whole body was burning and turned into a fire stick." "The flesh was already charred and could not be saved." How tragic!</p>
<p>Did Ms. Xiao burn to death in the raging, visible flames? I say: "No"; what destroyed Ms. Xiao was the invisible and odorless residual flames of the so-called "old theories" and "old concepts."</p>
<p>"When Ms. Xiao came to Nanyang, her brother strongly opposed it. When the incident was discovered on the ship, her brother was even more regretful and wrote a letter to sever relations with her. Some say this was one of the reasons for the lady's suicide," said the Guowen News Agency:</p>
<p>The general concept of our noble country's society is "keeping to one's place" and "guarding one's own." Even in terms of career issues, it does not advocate "risk" and "creation."</p>
<p>Originally, this kind of concept has a long history and is deeply rooted. Guanzi said: "The son of a scholar will always be a scholar, the son of a farmer will always be a farmer, and the son of a craftsman will always be a craftsman." Han Feizi said: "A family with a constant business will not starve even if they are hungry." From this "constant" and "fixed" career concept, it evolved into the later "keeping to one's place" and "guarding one's own" career concept. Yao Shifu said: "Those who are sons and grandsons must have the ambition to start a business before they can maintain it; they must have the heart to guard against misfortune before they can live in peace." Ji Dakui said: "In all kinds of arts and crafts and doing business, you must always be righteous, abide by the principles of heaven, and be content with your duty. All kinds of risky and empty businesses must not be done." This concept of "maintaining the status quo," "guarding against misfortune," "abiding by the principles of heaven," and "being content with one's duty" has swallowed up countless young people with "adventurous ideas" and a "creative spirit" in China for thousands of years. Although it is said that this man-eating old concept has been reformed a lot recently; however, its residual flames are still burning continuously. The so-called "men" are intimidated by the authority of the residual flames of old concepts and dare not do anything. I don't know how many there are.</p>
<p>The bold Ms. Xiao, as a "woman," actually did not have a "heart to guard against misfortune," did not "keep to her place," crossed the ocean, went to a foreign land, "took the risk" to go to Nanyang, and sought food in other countries. No wonder her brother wanted to "strongly oppose it." Unfortunately, she encountered an unexpected "disaster" on the way. No wonder her brother was "even more regretful and severed relations with her."</p>
<p>The authority of the residual flames destroyed Ms. Xiao of Yixing! It destroyed thousands upon thousands of Ms. Xiaos whose names are unknown!</p>
<h3 id="e128">Hoping for Beauty on the Other Side of the Sky <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yinong</p>
<p>That old man Qu Yuan is really unexpected, he also comes to talk about love, but he is too overestimated, he is neither a pretty boy, nor has omnipotent money, how can he move the heartstrings of a girl to talk about love with him? So, he had to temporarily use his king as a beauty to play a farce of homosexuality and unrequited love. But his achievement is still nothing more than [thinking of beauty, wiping tears and waiting for a gift], and in the end, he still has to ask the old man to be a floating corpse in the Miluo River to conform to the principle after being lovelorn. Blame yourself, what else can be said!</p>
<p>Now there is a modern beauty, who is waiting on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean, coincidentally separated from an old Mr. C, who has the same background as old man Qu, by the Silver River, with tender affection. She grew up in a rich family, and her appearance is as beautiful as a water lily, so she caused that old Mr. C to have a thought of good desire, and he could not sleep or eat. But that beauty, although "sometimes moves with slight容", but also "hesitates and does not come", Mr. C is really dizzy and anxious, so he shouted loudly: [Beauty, I really miss you! I really love you! But you are so cruel, I will be burned for you, please come and save my life! "Although this old Mr. C shouted so loudly, but that beauty, still seemed to hear or not, so a group of dwarfies growing up in Miaodong couldn't help but secretly laughed and said: "Everyone come and see the toad wants to eat swan meat!" I looked at this situation and kept worrying about this honest old Mr. C, so I had to warn him like this:</p>
<p>Old C! Don't be so infatuated. If you continue like this without seeking a new life, then you will become a floating corpse in the Pacific Ocean. Quickly wave the sword of wisdom, cut off the threads of love, and seek self-salvation!</p>
<h3 id="e129">Novel Field Lord <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>A moon like half a cartwheel hung in the center of the pure black sky, the night gradually deepened; half of the fifty warriors lying in ambush in the woods waiting to die were conquered by fatigue and fell asleep, and half gradually slackened because the Wako across the river did not move.</p>
<p>The Wako are the most cunning, the most brutal, the most... things. Suddenly, when the sky was about to dawn and the Tianjia Zhuang people were extremely tired, taking advantage of the wind, countless rockets were shot from the willow forest; in an instant, the air was filled with the stench of sulfur fireballs, and torches flew across the river, and the raging flames were active everywhere. The willow forest immediately became a fire forest.</p>
<p>Needless to say, while the current "Tianjia soldiers" were busy avoiding the fire, the Wako crossed the pontoon bridge. "Children! Today's matter is only death!" The Tianzhuang Lord's big knife was flying in the fire, chopping to death more than a dozen leading Wako, while issuing a decisive order. The second, third, and fifth sons, | the entire team, like madmen, fought with Wako, who outnumbered them by thirty or forty times, in the square in front of the village courtyard, breaking their guns, using swords, breaking swords, using fists, bending fists, kicking, , bumping and roaring, | dying.</p>
<p>The aunt led several women, and none of them retreated. They all irrigated the soil with fresh blood. "Rush in!" Jumping over the square decorated with corpses and bloodstains, the Wako swaggered into the old home of the Tianzhuang Lord. The leaders sat in a hall like demons. "Another one died!" A small fight broke out in the kitchen, and the searching Wako reported that another sick Chinese person had been killed. "Now, all that's left alive here is this dog!" He pointed proudly to a mange-ridden stray dog under the steps.</p>
<p>"Woof: : : Woof: : : Woof" The stray dog ​​seemed to be deliberately feigning illness, and immediately opened a pair of red lamp-like eyes, bared its teeth and claws, pounced on the hall, and desperately bit off the head of the largest leader in the middle. Of course, it was also immediately cut into several pieces by the Wako.</p>
<p>The cock crowed loudly in the distance, and the morning sun lowered the golden red curtain, ending this tragic short play. (End)</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3 id="e130">In a Small Restaurant <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Luding</p>
<p>Eating and drinking, men and women, these are the great desires of people! Of course, the diet of the wealthy is indeed exquisite. Today it's Sichuan cuisine, tomorrow it's Beijing cuisine, or yesterday it was Western cuisine, or the day after tomorrow it will be Fujian cuisine······</p>
<p>But, like a poor wretch like me, today and tomorrow are the same, yesterday and the day after tomorrow are about the same, there is nothing to write about, even if I write about it, I eat dry rice when I have money, and eat pancakes when I have no money, so what is there to write about? There is no need to write about it.</p>
<p>If I said that I am a noble self-proclaimed hermit, if I said that I am a very person who is satisfied with poverty and peace, it seems that I am not, like the lonely king drunk in the peach palace, like the son banquet in the Zhuangyuan Building, I have never done it, but I do not hope.</p>
<p>Oil and heat, sweetness and deliciousness, are indeed what people like, but big wine and big meat are simply going to kill me, so, I say, small restaurants are better.</p>
<p>Actually, I am not saying that small restaurants will have some good things, and how could I not want to go to a big restaurant like Grandma Liu, but when it comes to big restaurants, I can only think of big restaurants, firstly, I don’t have a foreign outfit on my body, and secondly, I don’t have foreign money in my pocket, 丨 and then? God knows, originally, the reason why big restaurants can be established is that they have their own nobility, their own magic, and their own customers, anyway, small restaurants are the same 丨</p>
<p>The egg fried rice and fish porridge in the small restaurant often make my mouth water, and the two-mao-per-person set meal is really not sloppy at all.</p>
<p>A plate of cabbage, a bowl of clear soup, steaming on the table, people will get familiar with it, and after a long time, maybe add a little bit of delicious coriander, but also add a smiling face and a diligent heart from the waiter.</p>
<h3 id="e131">"Pidgin English" and "Esperanto" <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw entertained newspaper reporters in Beiping. Someone asked if he had learned Chinese after arriving in China? Shaw said: "No; I don't know a word. But I am very interested in Pidgin English. Most languages ​​are too constrained by grammar; Pidgin English does not have this drawback. I believe this language may become the future Esperanto." The reporter informed him that Chinese actually does not pay attention to grammar. Shaw said: "Then, Chinese may become Esperanto in the future." (See Tianjin Dagong Bao, February 23)</p>
<p>This passage is interestingly speculated by George Bernard Shaw, and a certain reporter is laughably naive. Western scholars study Chinese characters more from the perspective of sound; and Chinese character scholars emphasize form and meaning, with slightly different directions. George Bernard Shaw's interest in Pidgin English is also due to a different direction. However, the old gentleman certainly does not know that someone had said this before him. About six years ago, Wu Zhihui discussed the national pronunciation and Esperanto. He had already deduced from the standpoint of the world language that Pidgin English has the potential to become the world language. The most important conditions for Esperanto are: first, the spelling method must be simple, and second, the grammatical rules must be simple. Pidgin English has the second advantage, such as:</p>
<p>"The steamer has two eye,</p>
<p>No eye how can see</p>
<p>No can see, how can walk"</p>
<p>(Translation) That ship has two eyes, (referring to the two lights in front)</p>
<p>Without eyes, how can you see,</p>
<p>Cannot see, how can you run.</p>
<p>They use the syntax of Chinese to use the spelling letters of English. Boldly transforming English grammar. This kind of boldness is extremely useful for promoting the progress of the English language. However, if Pidgin English and other languages ​​and writing systems are allowed to grow naturally, after a long period of complex changes in various places, they will still be too constrained by grammar, just like the various existing Western languages. The emergence of Esperanto must be a simple and regular rule, due to human rather than natural growth; it can also be concluded that Pidgin English will not become the future Esperanto.</p>
<p>As for the bastard of a certain reporter, it is simply time to hit the palm of his hand. "Grammar" is a description of science, which is added to the existing status quo for induction, and several principles are obtained from induction, and several exceptions are attached to those that do not conform to the principles. Is there any language in the world that does not pay attention to grammar? There are very many Western scholars who have studied this aspect (see Prof. Gabelentz's (German professor) Chinesische Grammatik (Wen Jingwei). A certain reporter should not lose his soul anymore!</p>
<h3 id="e132">Wandering Monk <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>A few days ago, it snowed heavily. Looking out from the window, the street was deserted, without a living soul. The street seemed narrower than usual; it was so quiet, it had become a street from an ancient painting. Under the eaves of the building across the street, even more desolate than the street, sat a wandering monk, wearing a bamboo hat, eyes closed, a thin robe hanging on his gaunt frame, rhythmically knocking on a large wooden fish. The wind howled, blowing flakes of snow onto him; the snow clung to his collar and melted on his body. I watched and shivered for him, but he remained motionless, still knocking on the wooden fish, without even opening his eyes. I saw an empty rickshaw pull past him. The puller hunched his neck, resting the shafts on his armpit, both hands tucked into his sleeves, slowly pacing along, white mist-like vapor puffing from his mouth.</p>
<p>I saw a woman, bundled up like a goose, her hands tucked under her lapels, a soy sauce bottle peeking out, her ears covered by a velvet hat, a red nose sticking out in front, white mist-like vapor puffing from her nostrils, walking past him, close to the eaves. Her knees seemed frozen stiff, her legs straight, straddling, hobbling along. Afterwards, no one else passed by. The snow fell heavier and heavier, and the sky darkened. Around dusk, I saw a man wearing a crooked, tattered melon-cap, a torn burlap coat, his hair hanging straight down to the collar of his coat, barefoot in heelless shoes, hands in his sleeves, a cigarette butt dangling from the corner of his mouth, wandering past, puffing white mist-like vapor.</p>
<p>But the wandering monk remained motionless, sitting there, rhythmically knocking on the wooden fish—that empty, lonely sound!</p>
<p>At dinner, my mother told the servant to give him a large bowl of rice and a bowl of hot soup. After a while, the servant returned empty-handed, saying, "I left it there."</p>
<p>"Did he eat it?"</p>
<p>"No! He just bowed once and said 'Amitabha.'"</p>
<p>After dinner, I ran out to see him. In the darkness, the sound of the wooden fish echoed, the gray robe still spread on the ground. I asked him:</p>
<p>"Master, you must be hungry, why don't you eat some rice?"</p>
<p>"Amitabha, a monk is used to being cold and hungry." He didn't even open his eyes.</p>
<p>"Where is the Master's temple?"</p>
<p>"At Foguang Temple on Mount Wutai in Shanxi."</p>
<p>"How many years has the Master been a monk?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes. After a moment, he said, "Twenty-three years."</p>
<p>"Master, why did you become a monk halfway through life?"</p>
<p>He was silent for a long while. "It's a long story. Karma! I was originally from Wutai County. Next door to our house lived a girl—so pure, a lotus flower!" He lowered his head.</p>
<p>I understood.</p>
<p>But then he continued with a long explanation: "At that time, I was a playboy, a scoundrel who specialized in stealing the chastity of virgins. I tempted her every day, yes, I tempted her. Before long, on a summer evening, in the wheat field, this white lotus flower bloomed. One day, she knelt before me, she cried, she said she was pregnant, she begged me to marry her. The poor child, she pleaded so pitifully! But I—I was truly inhuman, I stood up, this child, yes, this child, she was stunned there. That night, I didn't feel anything. Three days later, she died. Some say she hanged herself, others say she died of a sudden illness, but I know how she died. She was buried behind our house. For twelve consecutive nights, I couldn't sleep, I saw this karmic debt kneeling before me, crying. One evening, I ran away, ran to Mount Wutai, rhythmically knocking on the wooden fish, repenting. Until five years ago, when I dreamed of her for five consecutive days. I understood, she felt I hadn't suffered enough. So I came down the mountain, enduring the iron-like hardships in the wind and rain . . . " He began knocking on the wooden fish again.</p>
<p>Returning home, I sat clutching my hair. I heard the sound of the wooden fish, in the quiet, cold night, the rhythmic sound, striking my soul, again and again. Nine o'clock, ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock . . . hour after hour passed, the sound of the wooden fish just heavily struck my soul. Suddenly, I felt cold all over. I knelt on the ground, in the sound of the wooden fish, I put my palms together, I repented.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Weekly Miscellany (Continued) <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Kebiao</p>
<p>All the texts praising the metropolis invariably center on the night and are built on the foundation of artificiality. However, in reality, does the metropolis truly lack a morning? And upon what foundation are these artificial constructions built? First comes the morning, then the night. If one does not go to the vegetable market early in the morning to purchase ingredients, from where does a sumptuous meal come? The sun rises in the east and shines equally on Avenue Joffre, even if Avenue Joffre may ignore it.</p>
<p>But the metropolis is not just one corner, and Shanghai is not only Avenue Joffre. The sunlight on other roads is also not disregarded. Some mornings leap over certain streets and alleys in Shanghai. For example, what are the mornings like in Xiaoshadu, Caojiadu, Huade Road, and Sun Temple? Isn't the sunlight on the faces, backs, and shoulders of the working masses magnificent? Isn't it more dazzling than the lights on the waists of dancing girls and under the bottoms of wine glasses?</p>
<p>Many people praise the metropolis, many people praise the night. I hope more people will come to praise the morning. At least, the morning has urged me to write the Weekly Miscellany. Someone has written "Shanghai Night Talks," and I cannot help but hope that someone will come out to write "Shanghai Morning Talks."</p>
<p>Night</p>
<p>However, I do not despise the night. The night has its own value, and those who are active at night also have more meaningful activities than the pleasures of the metropolis's residents. For example, petty thieves and bandits who butcher pigs are struggling for a living and not wasting their lives. Some literati and writers often like to write after the night is deep and quiet, and astrologers observe celestial phenomena. Undoubtedly, it is necessary to have darkness. Newspaper editors and printing workers are also destined to work only at night.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who are active at night are not necessarily only rats, bats, owls, prostitutes, and pure metropolitan residents. The beauty of lights does not necessarily have to be felt only in dance halls and bars, because there are also lighthouses that shine all night, indicating the progress of ships in rivers and seas. Even the few streetlights on the road have a unique serenity.</p>
<p>The true charm of the night cannot be appreciated on streets like Avenue Joffre and North Sichuan Road, and even less can it be enjoyed under the lights of dance halls and hotels. Those places give you another kind of intoxication, a kind of muddiness, but that is not what the night wants to give you. I say that what the night gives people is a kind of serenity, like the light and shadow of high-rise buildings illuminated by the streetlights on cold streets; it is a kind of leisure, like the ships moored along the wharves in the Shiliupu area bathed in moonlight; it is a kind of rest, like a baby sleeping soundly in its mother's arms; or it is a kind of tension, like a helmsman at sea watching the lighthouse, like newspaper printing workers engaged in their work.</p>
<p>The unique beauty of the night is in the darkness. Astrologers can only glimpse the secrets of the stars in the darkness, but dance halls are filled with artificial lights. How can the flashlights on the wrists of dancing girls compare to the stars in the sky? The unique beauty of the night is in silence. Writers can only excite their pens in the silence of the quiet night, but how can one be comfortable in the noise of the bars filled with human voices?</p>
<p>The fundamental mistake is that the places where metropolitan residents go do not treat the night as night. They are seeking paintings in the night, which is an inversion. Therefore, they can only seek confusion, because only by being confused can they turn night into a painting. When it comes to resisting nature, they have no part in it. To resist nature, one must first recognize nature, which is what they fear the most. They dare not look nature in the eye, not even dare to look at the sun in the morning. How can one hope to talk about resisting nature!</p>
<p>Only those who sink and fall, their fate cannot be changed. But I am not talking about the destruction of the metropolis, because I said that the metropolis has more than one angle, and the metropolis has a new foundation that can be rebuilt.</p>

<p>— George Bernard Shaw, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"According to this, is there anything to comfort us?" Mr. Croker said. "We are bound to perish anyway." "Not necessarily," said the first gentleman.</p>
<p>"Definitely," Mr. Croker said sternly. "The temperature conditions in which life can exist are already known and beyond question. You cannot live in freezing temperatures, nor can you live in the heat of a furnace. Whichever of these temperatures the Earth reaches, we are bound to perish."</p>
<p>"No!" said the first gentleman. "These temperatures you speak of are only harmful to a part of us, namely our bodies. Our bodies die within a few years, often in those airy bedrooms where the temperature is kept very comfortable. But what about the thing that makes the difference between a living body and a dead body? Is there any evidence, any possibility, that its existence depends to any great extent on temperature? Although it has the strange quality of creating for itself those forms of flesh, it is certainly not blood, nor flesh, nor bone. It is something intangible. If you try to define it, you must think of it as an electromagnetic wave, as a vibration rate, as a spinning of wood, or if the ether exists, in other words, as such a thing. If this thing exists—and who can doubt its existence?—then it can exist on the coldest dead star, or in the hottest fiery mouth of the sun."</p>
<p>"Then," said one of the ladies, "how do you know the sun is hot?"</p>
<p>"What a strange question!" Mr. Croker said scornfully. "I feel it's hot, I know it."</p>
<p>"You feel pepper is hot," said the lady, returning his scorn with flavor. "But you can't light a match with it."</p>
<p>"You feel that the notes on the right end of a piano keyboard are higher than the notes on the left side; but both notes are on the same plane," said another lady.</p>

<p>(Beiping) The famous 19th Route Army has now joined the battle. Zhang Xueliang has appointed Weng Zhaoyuan, who defended the Wusong Fort during the Shanghai War, to reorganize the Rehe artillery and serve as the commander of the division. Weng is now starting his service in Rehe, assisted by Wu Guoren (transliteration), an officer of the 19th Route Army. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>Not Considering Success or Failure</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin told a Reuters reporter that the Japanese were fabricating rumors, referring to him as a puppet official of the pseudo-state. He has never had any dealings with the pseudo-state. As a soldier, his duty is to defend the country and fight the enemy to the death, regardless of success or failure. The Japanese are using the old trick of destroying Korea, supporting Pu as a puppet. In less than two years, they will repeat the performance of the deposed Korean prince. When Tang spoke, there was also a certain foreign military officer present, who was moved. (3rd, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tang Yulin told reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers in Chengde on the 2nd that since the September 18th Incident, Japan has occupied our three northeastern provinces and still thinks it can deceive the eyes and ears of the world. After the establishment of the pseudo-state, it declared to the outside world that he was also an official of the pseudo-state. In fact, he has never had any dealings with the pseudo-state. Since September 18th, he has only known to defend the country and protect the people. Japan invades our country, and he can only resist bravely to fulfill his duty as a soldier. Success or failure is not a consideration. This time, the Japanese army attacked Rehe and fabricated public opinion. In fact, our thirty million compatriots in the three northeastern provinces, under the oppression of power, do not want to be double slaves and are eagerly looking forward to the government recovering the lost territory. This is the true intention of the people of the Northeast. Recalling when Japan destroyed Korea, it initially retained the position of the prince, but soon destroyed him. Today, Japan supports Puyi as a puppet ruler in the Northeast. I dare to assert that Puyi's position will be completely destroyed in less than two years. We have a lesson from the past, so at this time when the Japanese invaders are launching a large-scale attack on Rehe, our people and government should jointly rise up to resist the insult. He has a responsibility to defend the territory and will shed his blood and do his best to deal with the Japanese to the end. (3rd, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chengde: A special Reuters correspondent met with Tang Yulin today. Tang admitted that he was about to go to the front line, but news of Lingyuan's encirclement came. The situation there is now very critical. Tang also said that he wants the world to know that he will fight to the end. The people of Rehe deeply hate the pseudo-Manchukuo and are willing to fight hard. Also, the Japanese army attacking the border of Chifeng has been repelled. Tang looked tired and, after talking with the Reuters correspondent, set off for the front line to supervise the battle. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Reuters, London, March 3) In the past few days, the Chinese embassy in London has been surrounded by hundreds of British people who volunteered to participate in the war in Rehe and serve China. Among them are many veterans, as well as some doctors, and there are also people who intend to take stomach risks. There are also many British women who are willing to serve as nurses.

<p>Reasons for My Resignation</p>
<p>The Focus of the Sino-Japanese Situation Shifts from Geneva</p>
<p>The Government Should Vigorously Resist the Japanese Army in Jehol</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Wellington Koo, in an interview with Reuters last night, confirmed that he and Representatives Yen and Quo had resigned from their positions as representatives to the League of Nations in Nanjing. However, he stated that after they inquired with the government about its position and plans, they received a reply and agreed to continue serving. Dr. Koo also mentioned that, in the opinion of the representatives in Geneva, the Chinese government should appoint new figures to the League of Nations to express their views, as the current representatives have been working for a long time and are now exhausted. They feel that one act of the Sino-Japanese dispute has now ended, and the focus of the Sino-Japanese situation has shifted from Geneva to Jehol. China should provide a very strong resistance to the Japanese army in Jehol, which is the main reason for their resignation. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Central Government Sends Telegram to Persuade Them to Stay</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Geneva dispatch reported that the three Chinese representatives to the League of Nations, Yen Hui-ching, Wellington Koo, and Quo Tai-chi, had telegraphed Nanjing, resigning from their positions. A Central News Agency reporter specifically inquired about this matter this morning with a prominent figure who had just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. According to him, the three representatives' request to resign had been a fact for several days. The three representatives intended to express that, as of today, the only way to resist Japanese aggression is through desperate resistance. However, the government had already resolved to resist Japan, so the Central Political Council had already decided to send a telegram of reassurance the day before (the 1st), instructing them of the government's determination to resist and adopting all the proposed opinions.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations today passed a plan to prohibit the shipment of arms to Paraguay and Bolivia and will invite the United States to participate in this cooperation. The Council will soon reconvene to discuss the actions to be taken regarding the South American dispute. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the prohibition of arms shipments to Bolivia and Paraguay, after proposals were made by Britain and France, the Secretariat of the League of Nations seemed prepared to draft a declaration. The representatives of the Council of the League of Nations recently held an informal meeting to discuss how to draft the question. After this declaration is passed by the Council, it will be submitted to countries that manufacture arms, countries that transport arms in transit, and other countries, asking them to sign. The major powers are very cautious about this matter. Therefore, this declaration must first be recognized individually by the representatives of the Council, and after a formal discussion by the Council, it can be distributed to the governments of various countries for their approval. A press release from the Secretariat of the League of Nations stated that, regarding the Anglo-French proposal to prohibit arms shipments to Bolivia and Paraguay, the three-member committee of the League of Nations responsible for inspecting the dispute between the two countries today requested opinions from countries other than Britain and France. The three-member committee has put forward detailed suggestions to allow the countries that agree to participate in this action to consider and coordinate their actions. The suggestions of the three-member committee include three items: (1) How to declare a commitment not to directly or indirectly export and sell arms to the parties involved; (2) Specify what types of arms should be prohibited; (3) Agree on ways to coordinate actions with each other; (4) Stipulate under what conditions each government considers its declaration to be effective and notify each other. The three-member committee declares that it intends to ask the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to include the issue of implementing Article 11 of the Covenant on the Council's agenda.

<p>Earthquake in Japan Early This Morning</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, March 3rd: At 2:30 AM this morning, Tokyo suddenly felt a very strong earthquake, which lasted for quite a while, causing great panic. Although the city only suffered minor damage, 1,500 houses in Kamaishi and Iwate were swept away by a large tidal wave caused by the earthquake. According to investigations, Kamaishi was the hardest hit, and many villages and towns along the northeast coast also suffered the same fate. The houses were either destroyed by the earthquake or swept away by the tidal wave.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: The seismograph at the West Bromwich Observatory indicated that there was a large earthquake 6,000 miles away at 5:43 PM today, which lasted until 9:00 PM. The tremor was so strong that the instrument's rod also vibrated out of its socket, making it impossible to obtain complete records. According to the observatory director, Shaw, this was the largest earthquake he had experienced in his 28 years.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: Japan experienced a very strong earthquake early this morning, causing significant loss of life and property in several places. It is now believed that the epicenter of the earthquake was the island of Kinkasan, east of Matsushima. Matsushima is one of Japan's three major scenic spots. In 1896, Kinkasan experienced a tsunami that destroyed the entire northeast coast, killing 30,000 people. Today's tidal wave occurred 40 minutes after the earthquake and was about four to ten feet high. The northeast coast of the main island, 300 miles long, was affected, with the affected area extending from Ishinomaki, east of Matsushima, to Shiriyazaki at the northernmost tip of the island. Even Hokkaido was affected. The area with the most earthquake fatalities was Omoto, with more than 100 deaths. Elsewhere, the number of deaths ranged from a few to dozens. Countless houses were destroyed and fishing boats sunk.</p>

According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the maximum amplitude was 40 millimeters, comparable to the large earthquake in Izu in previous years.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: The Naval Ministry announced that at 9:00 AM today, the Yokosuka Naval District dispatched two flying boats from Kashiwada and one flying boat from Tateyama to investigate the earthquake disaster.

<p>Banks Closed in Eighteen U.S. States</p>
<p>More Than 50 Million People Affected by the Suspension of Payments</p>
<p>Stock Exchanges Closed, Agricultural Centers Halted</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, February 2nd: The number of U.S. states that have announced bank holidays has now increased to eighteen, affecting more than 50 million people. Several states, including Texas, also announced bank closures today. Because the duration of the holidays varies, some are only four days, while others are as long as fifteen days.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 3rd: The stock exchanges in San Francisco, Cleveland, and Detroit, as well as the cotton exchanges in New Orleans and New York, are now closed.

<p>New President Roosevelt</p>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony Simplified</p>
<p>Economic Cleanup Plan</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd: Roosevelt appointed Rear Admiral Grayson as the director of the preparatory committee for the new president's inauguration ceremony. Roosevelt advocated for a simplified ceremony but has agreed to a day of celebration. The official ballroom dance, which was abolished by former President Wilson, will be revived. The Democratic Party won a major victory in the general election last November, so the president's inauguration ceremony will have the flavor of a Democratic celebration. Most of the newly elected governors of the 38 Democratic states will come to Washington to participate in the grand ceremony. The person supervising the oath will be Attorney General Hughes. If the weather is fine, the ceremony will be held in the open square outside the Capitol, but if the weather is bad, the ceremony will be held indoors, and only a small portion of the 100,000 spectators will be allowed to enter.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd: Congress will grant the new president the power to reorganize the structure of government departments. Experienced inspectors generally acknowledge that the new president will exercise this power. Roosevelt's close advisors have been preparing economic matters for several weeks, but the contents are kept secret, which shows that Roosevelt intends to conduct a major cleanup. The relief plan under the economic plan grants Roosevelt the power to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in budget expenditures. The relief plan is currently in the final stages of negotiation in Congress. In addition to the ten administrative departments of the cabinet, the new president can abolish or merge any executive agencies in the ten departments to save expenses, but he cannot abolish their functions, because any political affairs decided by Congress must be implemented.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wilson, 3rd: Walsh, who was traveling to Washington to take office as Attorney General, suddenly suffered a heart attack in the car at 7:10 PM tonight and died. His remains have been moved to a funeral home for burial. His wife, who had just been married for a week, was also in the car and is now said to be overwhelmed with grief and mentally distraught. The successor to the position of Attorney General will likely be lawyer Mullen.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 2nd: New President Roosevelt departed from New York tonight and will meet with President Hoover tomorrow. It is generally believed that Roosevelt and Hoover will discuss the economic situation. New President Roosevelt has recently appointed former Ambassador to Belgium, Phillips, as Undersecretary of State.</p>
<p>Hitler's Massive Arrest of Communists</p>
<p>More Than Two Thousand Detained in Two Days</p>
<p>The Election Campaign Is Just a Sham</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 2nd: The cabinet decided to hold the opening ceremony of the new Reichstag in the garrison church of Potsdam. Communists and socialists will probably not be allowed to participate, so it will be easy for the government to announce an indefinite postponement after the opening and then proceed with its four-year plan. It is expected that the Reichstag will be convened on April 4. The current election campaign has become a one-sided affair, and the public pays very little attention to it. However, it is expected that at least 85% of voters will vote on Sunday. The Socialists are confident that they will be able to greatly increase their votes and expect that the National Socialists will definitely not be able to win a complete victory as they hope. The National Socialists are still carrying out a large-scale purge of the Communists. In the past two days, more than two thousand people have been arrested in Rhineland and Westphalia. Stammfer, the editor-in-chief of the Socialist newspaper Vorwärts, was also arrested early this morning because he signed a declaration criticizing the government's closure of Social Democratic Party newspapers as illegal. This statement has been denied by the authorities, who claimed that the police searched for him but did not find him. The cabinet has decided to ban foreign journalists from spreading information that is inconsistent with the German government's news. Prussian Interior Minister Göring broadcast a speech today, stating that the government is determined to eradicate communism, but there is no danger if the Socialists or Communists engage in propaganda within the legal scope.</p>

<p>In Broad Daylight</p>
<p>All Circles Are Surprised</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10:30 AM on the 3rd, the Shanghai Bank at the intersection of Zhuque Road was robbed. Two robbers, each carrying a pistol, stood guard at the gate. One was wearing a gray camel hair robe and a felt hat, and the other was wearing a blue short coat, looking like a worker, both about twenty years old. One robber entered and jumped into the counter. At that time, cash and foreign currency were being collected. He searched the table and drawers, stealing more than 3,020 yuan in cash and banknotes. Another customer, Zhang Xintai, had just exchanged 950 yuan in silver dollars at the bank and was about to leave when the robber noticed him and robbed him as well.

<h3 id="e140">Song Ziwen Delivers Important Speech <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Already Telegraphing Luo Wen-gan About the League of Nations Representatives' Resignation</p>
<p>Should Use Utmost Effort to Resist in Jehol</p>
<p>Rumors Circulating Are Familiar Japanese Propaganda Tactics</p>
<p>Decided to Continue Suspending Boxer Indemnity Payments for Another Year</p>
<p>Acting Premier Song Ziwen, accompanied by Secretary Huang Chundao and Zhang Xueliang's Western advisor, Donald, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday morning to discuss the financial problems of North China with the financial community. At 11:00 AM this morning, Song met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence on Qiqi Road and delivered an important speech. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resignation of the Three Representatives</p>
<p>The reporter first asked about the Reuters dispatch this morning that our country's League of Nations representatives, Yan Huiqing, Wellington Koo, and Guo Taiqi, had telegraphed Nanjing to resign.</p>
<p>What is the truth? Song replied that he had not heard anything about it and planned to immediately telegraph Foreign Minister Luo Wengan to inquire about the truth.</p>
<p>Uncertainty About Going North</p>
<p>When asked when he would go north, he said that his trip north was still undecided and would depend on the practical needs in the future. His visit to Shanghai this time was (1) to inspect the minting of new coins at the mint and (2) to discuss various financial matters.</p>
<p>The Battle of Jehol</p>
<p>Regarding the battle of Jehol, telegrams have been frequently reporting in recent days that our army has suffered many setbacks. The reporter asked Song about the truth of the battle of Jehol this morning. Song said that the battle of Jehol initially took place in the railway area, where the Japanese side had various transportation conveniences. Our army had to change its lines for strategic reasons. Now, our army is holding firmly to the dangerous positions and will use our utmost efforts to resist desperately. Success or failure is not a matter of concern. As for rumors of Sun Dianying's surrender and the defection of the volunteer army, these are familiar Japanese propaganda tactics and are not worth refuting.</p>
<p>Abolishing the Tael and Changing to the Yuan</p>
<p>Song also stated that the abolition of the tael and the change to the yuan was originally scheduled to take effect on March 1, but because he had been away from Nanjing for many days and had not made any arrangements, it had to be postponed. The currency system regulations have been submitted to the Central Political Council for discussion and passed yesterday and can be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review today, which should not be a problem.</p>
<p>20 Million National Treasury Bonds</p>
<p>Song also said that the 20 million national salvation treasury bonds were decided by the Beiping Political Affairs Committee and approved by the Central Political Council. The committee planned to use 500,000 yuan from the cigarette tax allocated to the committee by the central government each month as a fund to issue the bonds in Tianjin and Beiping. There has been much speculation from the outside world, but these are not the facts.</p>
<p>Boxer Indemnity Suspended for One Year</p>
<p>Song also stated that the Boxer Indemnity from various countries has been decided to be suspended for another year. However, the U.S. portion will be allocated to Tsinghua School expenses and the China Cultural and Educational Association Fund, as in the previous year. Although the Boxer Indemnity is suspended, the allocations will continue. As for the Japanese merchants refusing to pay Chinese customs duties at the checkpoints, we have lodged a strong protest and are negotiating with them.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Spy on Our Coast</p>
<p>The Outer Sea Police Department received a report that a Japanese warship was found in the waters off Shengshan Island. It first sailed on the sea and then went to the coastal ports to spy, intending to inspect the defenses of our coast. Several fishing boats there were planning to follow the Japanese warship to observe its movements, but they could not catch up because the Japanese warship was very fast. The Outer Sea Department has already sent telegrams to the First and Third Teams of Shenjiamen and Dinghai to quickly dispatch patrol boats to investigate the warship's movements, and at the same time, it has ordered coastal areas to be on alert.</p>

<p>Must Not Use Silver Taels After March 10th</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: To ensure compliance, the Ministry, in preparation for abolishing the tael, stipulates that the common silver taels in Shanghai and the silver standard coin of one yuan, or the old one-yuan silver coin with its original weight and fineness, should be converted at a fixed exchange rate of 7 qian 1 fen 5 li per yuan. This will take effect on March 10th of this year, as announced by the Ministry, and will be distributed to the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Associations for compliance. All stores in Shanghai, regardless of their business, must, from that date, uniformly calculate the prices of goods and all transactions in silver coins and must no longer use silver taels in order to emphasize the law and unify the system. You are hereby instructed to forward this order to all trade associations for their compliance. This order.</p>
<p>This newspaper has obtained a special list of exchange rate calculation methods, as follows: One silver standard coin = 23.493448 grams of pure silver.</p>

<p>Gongchuo, Qian Xinzhi, and Others Go to the Wharf to Welcome Him</p>
<p>To Go North in Ten Days to Participate in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Before Departure, He Will Visit His Old Friend Duan Qirui for a Chat</p>
<p>Liang Shiyi, the former Minister of Finance of the Beijing Government, arrived in Shanghai this morning at 8:30 a.m. aboard the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Company from Hong Kong. He landed at the Xinkang Wharf. According to Liang's statement to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, he will stay in Shanghai for more than twenty days before going north to participate in the War of Resistance. A second world war may be possible, but it will definitely not be for our country. The Chinese people's reliance on others is no different from a policy of suicide. In the future, the whole country should unite and fight to the end to win the final victory. The news of Liang's arrival in Shanghai is recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>The President Coolidge entered the port at 4:25 a.m. and berthed at Floating Pontoon No. 16 in Yangshupu at 6:00 a.m. Liang transferred to a small boat at 8:30 a.m. and landed at the Xinkang Wharf. With him were Cen Xuepin and three others. More than forty of Liang's relatives and friends, including Ye Gongchuo, Qian Xinzhi, Zheng Baozhao, and Sa Tongsheng, went to the wharf to welcome him. Liang was wearing a purple-brown satin robe and a black satin mandarin jacket. His beard and eyebrows were mottled with white, and he was already sixty-five years old. However, he was in high spirits and showed no signs of senility.</p>
<p>Participating in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Liang said that he would stay in Shanghai for more than twenty days and then go north to Ping to participate in the work of resisting Japan and saving the country. This work is the natural duty of all people in the country. Even a three-year-old child should participate in this work. When I leave Shanghai to go north, I do not intend to enter Beijing to become an official, but participating in political work is another matter. All citizens should understand and be concerned about the country's politics.</p>
<p>World War</p>
<p>Liang continued, "We have no way of interfering in the international situation. If we want to intervene, we must first consider our capabilities. Otherwise, how can we ask? A second world war may occur, but this war will definitely not be caused by our country or the Sino-Japanese issue. It's like two people fighting in the road, and a third party joins in, with different purposes. The Chinese people's reliance on others is no different from a policy of suicide. To survive, we must all fight to the end to win the final victory."</p>
<p>Japan as a Mad Dog</p>
<p>Liang said that Japan's various barbaric and unreasonable acts of aggression are like a mad dog. There is no need to criticize them, and there is no room for negotiation. If they invade, we can only resist.</p>
<p>Will Meet Duan</p>
<p>Liang also said that Liang and Duan Qirui are old friends, so he will visit him after arriving in Shanghai, but the date has not been determined. I rarely go out or speak while living in Hong Kong, except for reading. I have not met Hu Hanmin, but I met Tang Shaoyi once a few years ago. As for the commercial situation in Guangdong, it is more deserted than before, probably due to the impact of the world economy. Finally, the reporter asked if he was invited to go north by Zhang Hanqing by telegram. He strongly denied it, saying that there was no such thing.</p>
<p>Xie Moude Wields a Sharp Blade</p>
<p>Chops at His Companions in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>Hasn't Slept All Night, Continuously Chopping at Several Friends</p>
<p>Sharp Kitchen Knife Soaked in Blood</p>
<p>Xie Moude, a trainee at the Oriental Trust Company at 323 Fujian Road, is a 19-year-old from Nanjing. He has been working at the company for two years. He usually behaves in a well-behaved manner and gets along well with his colleagues. In the past two years, he has never had any ill feelings with anyone, and he has no suspicion or gap with Wang Ruixu, Gu Xuetong, Xia Fengfei, etc., who live in the same room. Last night, Wang Ruixu and his colleague Wang Wencheng, who lived in the neighboring room, went out to the theater to watch a play. When they returned at midnight, they still talked with Xie for a while before going to bed. Everyone was dreaming, but Xie got out of bed alone, wearing only a short shirt and a pair of military pants, barefoot and wearing shoes, holding a brand-new sharp kitchen knife in his hand, and chopped at the heads and faces of Gu Xuetong, Xia Fengfei, and Wang Ruixu, who were lying in the same room, in order. Gu's lips and Xia's head were cut. The two woke up in pain from their dreams, but they did not suspect that Xie was using a knife to treat them. They only thought that they were fighting because of nightmares, so they endured the pain and did not argue with him. However, Xie still scolded and continued to chop at Wang Ruixu, who was lying on the bed. Fortunately, Wang was sleeping with his head covered by the quilt. Although he was chopped several times, he was protected by the cotton quilt and was unscathed. Unexpectedly, Xie still did not stop after chopping everyone in the same room. He broke into the front room and chopped at Wang Wencheng's head and face, who was sleeping soundly. At this time, the clock struck two. The injured people got up one after another, and Xie fled out of the room and tightly pulled the door with his hand, so that everyone could not open the door to chase him. He then abandoned the knife and fled. As soon as he left the company's gate, the doorman and patrol of the company saw his condition and heard the noise in the room. Suspecting him, they questioned him. He claimed that his colleagues in the room were joking and there was nothing else. After deceiving the patrol, he ran to the room opened by Jiang Fachang, the captain of the detective team of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, at 314 Dachunghua Hotel on Xizang Road to hide. Jiang and Xie were friends. Jiang came to Shanghai this time and stayed at the hotel, and he had invited Xie to meet. Therefore, Xie hurriedly escaped to that place after the accident. As for the injured people, after Xie left the room, they discovered under the light that everyone's heads and faces were bleeding. Gu Xuetong's upper lip had also been cut off. Everyone was shocked and realized that Xie was not a nightmare and actually wanted to murder them. They advocated reporting to the authorities for investigation. Therefore, the doorman and patrol reported to the Old Gate Patrol Station and dispatched detective Feng Xiushan to the company to investigate. They found the murder weapon and sent the three injured people to the hospital. Gu was the most seriously injured and was hospitalized for treatment. Wang and Xia were slightly injured and were discharged from the hospital that night after applying medicine. Then, Detective Feng inquired about Xie Moude's usual whereabouts and went to Dachunghua Hotel to arrest him. He was arrested in Jiang's inner room. Jiang was also implicated. After the head of the patrol questioned him in detail, he ordered Jiang to be a witness, and Xie was detained. This morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court. Judge Feng Shide interrogated him. All the victims except Gu arrived in court. They all said that they had no grudges against Xie and that Xie was usually very kind to others. Xie confessed that he slept well last night and did not know why he did this. The court then asked about the origin of the murder weapon. Xie said that he met a prostitute named Xueying at the game hall and fell in love with her. Last Friday and Saturday, he went to Room 304 of the Xinhuizhong Hostel with the prostitute. After spending the night together, the prostitute decided to form a family with him and asked him to buy all the furniture, so he first bought this knife, etc. The patrol lawyer, Dang Baoyi, said that Xie's murder weapon was prepared in advance, and he had no mental illness, so it was difficult to escape the crime under Article 284, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. However, the case still needs to be investigated, so he requested an extension. Judge Feng then ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days.</p>
<p>Duan Qirui to Go to Hangzhou on the Fifth</p>

Xu also said that Duke Duan will stay in Hangzhou for a short time to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</p>

<p>Vietnamese Police Murder Case</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Presents a Serious Representation to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a serious representation to the Municipal Government regarding the Vietnamese police murder case. The original text roughly stated: "According to a letter from the Chaozhou Association in Shanghai, our association received a letter from our fellow villager Zhu Guhan, stating that his younger brother, Zhu Guting, a native of Chaoyang, 20 years old, was a shop assistant at Renhe Store on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. At 1:30 p.m. on the 25th of this month, he was passing by the Ningbo Hotel on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession when the Vietnamese police opened fire to disperse the crowd. Zhu Guting failed to escape and was shot in the chest, killing him on the spot. His elderly parents and young wife and children were left behind. How can they live after this tragedy? We implore you to help us redress the injustice." The letter stated that the Vietnamese police arbitrarily opened fire to disperse the crowd, injuring and killing passersby, which was an abuse of power, a violation of the law, and intentional homicide. If they are not severely punished, the citizens will be in danger at all times. In addition to sending a telegram to the Municipal Government to make a serious representation to the French Concession authorities, to punish the murderers according to the law, to provide generous compensation to the family of the deceased, and to guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future, to respect human life and provide protection, we should also send a telegram to uphold justice and provide assistance. The case of the Vietnamese police injuring people in the French Concession happened once before, but it was vaguely closed at the time, which led to recklessness. Today, a Chinese person was shot to death due to a minor police matter, and two people were shot and injured. If this case cannot be punished according to the law, the lives of the residents of the French Concession will be in a state of insecurity. It is reasonable to submit this to Your Excellency for review and urge you to make a serious representation to the French Consul so as to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderers and compensating the victims. This is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Government."</p>

<p>After the Suspension of Participation in the Chicago Expo</p>
<p>Exhibitors from Various Provinces and Cities Hold a Meeting</p>
<p>Preparing to Form an Association to Participate</p>
<p>After the Executive Yuan decided to suspend participation in the Chicago Expo, the Preparatory Committee was ordered to handle the closing. Exhibitors from various provinces and cities believed that the exhibits had all arrived in Shanghai and preparations were complete. Moreover, the opening date of the Chicago Expo was approaching. Now the government suddenly decided to suspend the progress, which was unexpected and regrettable. It has been decided to hold a meeting of exhibitors at the Exhibition Hall on Bailinan Road at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss the direction in order to request the government to continue the progress, otherwise, an association will be organized to participate on its own. Exhibitors from all provinces and cities can participate in the meeting to discuss the progress together.</p>
<p>Three Child Laborers Lured by Communists to Become Red Army Soldiers</p>
<p>Zhu Changyou, a child from Anhui, is 17 years old and lives at 34 Huade Road. Xue Zhengtao, a child from Shandong, is 15 years old and lives at 311 Taopeng Road. Fan Xiaoerzi, a child from Qingjiang, is 18 years old and lives in a bungalow without a number on Longjiang Road. The three children were child laborers at the British American Tobacco Company at 17 Huade Road. Suddenly, at about 5:00 p.m. on the 27th of last month, after receiving their wages from the company, they disappeared at the same time. Their families, Zhu Xinhe, Xue Zheng, Fan Yongfu, etc., searched everywhere, but there was no news. Later, Zhai Chunhua and Jiang Chunfang, colleagues of the tobacco company, learned that the three children had been deceived by the communists to join the Red Army. They notified Zhu Xinhe, who then reported to the Yulin Road Patrol Station with Xue and Fan based on the information. Detective Xie Wanfang and a Western detective arrested Wang Daren, a 20-year-old from Qingkou, at the corner of Kunming Road. He confessed that his accomplice was Wang Jinde, a 24-year-old from Guangdong, who lived in a pavilion at 139 Jiaxing Road. They secretly went to the address and arrested him, seizing a large number of reactionary books, and took them to the patrol station for detention. This morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the Second High Branch Court. Patrol lawyer Gan Jingxian stated the previous situation and requested an extension, saying that the two defendants admitted that they had joined the Communist Party in the patrol station. He presented various reactionary books for inspection. Then, Zhu Xinhe, Xue Zheng, Fan Yongfu, and witnesses Zhai Chunhua and Jiang Chunfang testified about the process. Zhai and Jiang claimed that the first defendant, Wang Daren, often came to the company gate at noon when the child laborers were released for lunch and talked and played with the three missing children, giving them pencils and notebooks, and telling them to go to Hankou to become Red Army soldiers. Judge Qing Zhao questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing to investigate and cross-examine them.</p>
<p>National Coal Relief Association</p>
<p>Requests Exemption from Coal Subsidy Fee</p>
<p>In addition to paying the mining area and production and sales tax every year, the coal sold in Shandong Province must also pay a temporary subsidy fee of 30 cents per ton. In July of last year, the National Coal Relief Committee of this port, considering that foreign coal was dumped and domestic coal was difficult to survive, submitted a request to the authorities for exemption. The exemption was granted for three months. Now that the exemption period has expired, the association heard that there was news of continued collection, and has submitted a report to the central government and the competent authorities on the state of decline of the Shandong coal mining industry, and based on the order of the Executive Yuan to the provincial and municipal governments that no additional coal tax should be levied except for statutory taxes, requesting that the temporary fee be exempted as soon as possible to relieve merchants.</p>
<p>Patrol Shoots Fellow Disciple</p>
<p>Surrenders to the Patrol Station After the Incident</p>
<p>Mu Shouren, a scoundrel from Shandong, 38 years old, and Wang Yuyao, a doorman patrol from Tianjin at 780 Zhonghui Bank, 97 Avenue Edward in the French Concession, were fellow disciples. Mu often went to Wang to borrow money. Wang initially used polite words to provide a small amount of assistance, but Mu regarded Wang as owing it to him. Recently, he went to the Zhonghui gate every day to wait for him. The day before yesterday, Mu went again, and Wang was extremely angry. He had him detained in the patrol station. The head of the patrol saw that he had no obvious criminal behavior and immediately reprimanded him and dismissed him. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 a.m. today, Mu went again and forcibly demanded money. Wang could no longer tolerate it and pulled out his pistol to threaten him. Somehow, with a bang, the bullet left the gun and hit Mu's abdomen. Mu fled across the road in pain and fled into the Public Concession. A Chinese patrolman No. 1964 saw him and took Mu to the Central Patrol Station on Sima Road and transferred him to Renji Hospital. Wang, who caused the accident, surrendered himself to the Great Bell Patrol Station. The head of the patrol asked a few questions and ordered him to be detained for investigation.</p>
<p>Japanese-Run Dance Hall</p>
<p>Business Plummets</p>
<p>丨This Is an Inevitable Phenomenon丨</p>
<p>Recently, the dance halls run by Japanese in this port have been deserted and silent after the exchange rate plummeted, except for the dance halls in coffee shops that do not charge fees. Therefore, in order to alleviate the situation, the operators plan to reduce ticket prices or abolish the music team and replace it with an electric phonograph. All dance tickets sold in the past were only three for one yuan, but now they can be bought for five at a lower price. On the one hand, the monthly salary system will now be changed to a weekly proportional income system, and the expansion of various restaurants and dance halls will be restricted.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Why Doesn't Matsuoka Commit Suicide? <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>In the year of Guiyou, the Xiongnu invaded the south, occupied the most important pass in the world and massacred Chaoyang, peeped into Beijing and Tianjin, and wanted to occupy the Central Plains. It seemed that the world could not be peaceful without destroying China. The whole country was in panic, and no one dared to resist the enemy. At this time, the European and American powers, with their foresight, did not want the great fat to be swallowed alone by the beast. Therefore, they issued their "non-heavenly pity" grand wish, chanting words in their mouths, and gathering the philosophy of the sages into chapters. After passing through the Nineteen Committees, they passed through the General Assembly of the League of Nations. From then on, the patriotic people of our country, as well as the gentlemen, all put their hands on their foreheads and congratulated each other, saying, "Justice is fortunately extended, and public opinion is more manifested. If it were not for our people's efforts to seek spiritual resistance, could we have obtained such a great victory?" It can be known that the upper and lower classes congratulated each other. However, Matsuoka, the chief representative on the other hand, could not be so happy. The reason is that the international elders are not willing to let Japan monopolize the Northeast. They want the Japanese army to withdraw to the Manchurian Railway area and establish an international police force to maintain the security of China's territory. Therefore, the Japanese Empire cannot avoid losing face. Therefore, Matsuoka Yosuke cannot avoid leaving Geneva with "sorrow and disappointment."</p>
<p>But I still remember that at the beginning of Matsuoka's appointment as chief representative, he had the determination to sacrifice himself for the country. In order to confirm that my memory is still sound, I found the following record in the old newspaper piles.</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency, Osaka, 18th: Recently, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun published Matsuoka Yosuke's hard work in Geneva, saying that when Matsuoka left the country for Geneva, his old mother personally presented him with a Japanese sword and told him to fight for the country, saying that if diplomacy failed in the League of Nations, he could commit suicide with the sword to show the spirit of the Yamato nation. Since the League of Nations General Assembly, Japanese diplomacy has gradually fallen into a stalemate. Matsuoka often showed signs of regret when he returned to his residence. He often opened the box and looked at the sword given by his mother and sighed. Therefore, a group of entourages are worried that Matsuoka will commit suicide.</p>
<p>According to the above record, Matsuoka should have obeyed his mother's order to "commit suicide to show the spirit of the Yamato nation" in order to be worthy of being a filial son and martyr. But he did not commit suicide, and a group of entourages were worried in vain, but only "left with sorrow and disappointment." And only said in self-explanation, "If I did not have the perseverance of an Oriental, I would definitely cry for it." In this way, the spirit of the Yamato nation cannot avoid being weakened. Alas, if I were a Japanese, "I would definitely cry for it."</p>
<p>Then, why doesn't Matsuoka commit suicide? Of course, he has his reasons. The first is that the representative of Siam gave up the right to vote on the resolution. This point cannot avoid being "what he is pleased with." At least, his diplomacy has not completely failed, so he can still avoid committing suicide. Secondly, the great powers' resolution to jointly manage the Northeast did not dare to clearly exclude Japan. Under the name of "Chinese sovereignty," Japanese imperialism can still open its bloody mouth and devour a large number of the Chinese working masses, but it cannot be full alone. Therefore, Matsuoka's diplomacy is still successful and does not disgrace the emperor's order, so of course, he can avoid committing suicide even more.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, the reasons for Matsuoka's not committing suicide are still sufficient, and the Chinese nation will never transcend its colonial status because of his suicide. Therefore, we the public can only commit suicide, arm ourselves, and seek our own liberation in the thorough anti-imperialist national revolutionary war.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Responding to "Giving Charcoal in the Snow" <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>A friend gave me a poem about sending coal to the refugees in Hualin Mountain after the snow, and asked me to respond to it. (The original poem has been published in this journal on the 1st of this month.) I respond to it according to the rhyme.</p>
<p>Alas, my fellow villagers, the soldiers have robbed them during the drought. Not yet three hundred years, they have suffered from famine nine times. (From the year of Shunzhi Wuzi to the present three hundred years, the river bandits have rebelled a total of nine times.) Some were burned overnight, and some were scattered in all directions. Those who fled sold their children for food, and those who were besieged dissected their bones for food. Those who went far away flowed to Tao and Min, and who gave them shelter on their poor journey? Those who came to the provincial capital, who watered their hungry intestines? Fortunately, there are wise men in the world who control happiness and suffering. They give porridge and clothes to avoid the invasion of cold. However, the heaven and man are blocked, and the heavy snow has submerged their shins. When will the bandits be suppressed? They endure the cold through the night. Only worry about the river water freezing hard, and the success or failure is difficult to predict. My friend Deng Zhonghua sighed at this. He wants to help the people after the robbery, and send charcoal in the snow to all of them. How can we get a generous family, and everyone will pity and embrace the rare?</p>
<h3 id="e145">Saving the Nation with Beauty <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Little Fellow</p>
<p>In such a year of "saving the nation," filled with fanfare and lively excitement, the ways to save the nation are truly too numerous to recount in one breath. Look, from "non-resistance to save the nation" to "aviation to save the nation," "motor to save the nation," "mantras to save the nation," "antiques to save the nation," "sports to save the nation," "machine gun to save the nation," "golf to save the nation," "morphine to save the nation," "dancing to save the nation," "entertainment to save the nation," "mahjong to save the nation," "prostitutes to save the nation," "La Dame aux Camélias to save the nation"... And then, there's the "saving the nation with beauty" by Ms. Chen Biyun of Hong Kong, which was shockingly published with a decorative border in the newspaper not long ago. Whew, I recited it too quickly and rapidly; I almost choked, this little fellow did!</p>
<p>When I discovered this "1933" style new term, this new path of "saving the nation with beauty," amidst my ecstatic joy and leaping three hundred, jumping five thousand times, tears welled up and soaked my coarse cloth gown. My friends were astonished and asked, "Where did this come from?" I told them, "My dear people, you are so pitiful, how can you be so foolish? Let me tell you, our motherland has yet another way to be saved! My tears, these tears, are tears of joy!" And so, after two days, or perhaps more than two days, my friends happily brought me Mr. Geng's two pieces of earnest and heartfelt, bodhisattva-like praise and advocacy for this "1933" new method of "saving the nation," to read to me. I closed my eyes, held my breath, and after listening quietly, I clapped my hands and stomped my feet, shouting in a melodious voice, "Wonderful, wonderful!" Indeed, if it weren't for my inherent thick skin, I would have gladly sold my pants belt to buy a pound or two of lead powder to "jade" up this "beauty," because this is a grand undertaking related to "saving" our riddled mother"land." However, what can be done? Is "thick skin saving the nation" even possible in this era? And so, I became somewhat indignant.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this attitude is incorrect. Others are burying their heads in makeup to "save the nation," while I am not looking for a way, but merely being "indignant," "indignant" about what? Forget it, let's cool down this brain, "eliminate prejudices," "overcome national difficulties together," and research the convenient and remarkably effective methods for implementing this new type of "saving the nation." And so, after my repeated trials and four attempts and seven failures, I finally discovered the following three self-evident principles with great pleasure. Friends, you are comrades enthusiastic about saving the nation, come, let's play with them together with one heart and one mind.</p>
<p>(1) Undoubtedly, "saving the nation with beauty" can greatly raise a sum of money to buy large quantities of military firearms to give to the "Volunteer Army" to fight the Japanese. However, I propose that we should not rush to use this "raised" sum of money to buy</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>military firearms for the "Volunteer Army" to fight the Japanese. We can use this money as capital to establish a large-scale "Beauty to Save the Nation Training Institute," divided into accelerated and regular courses. The reason is that this can broadly attract talent, provide training, and in the future, graduates can become a large group of "Beauty to Save the Nation," and then each member can use their "beauty" to raise money, so wouldn't there be more money and wouldn't there be an inexhaustible supply of military firearms? (2) Young men should give money to women who "save the nation with beauty," and when faced with reproaches from parents or condemnations from moralists, they should use this strong and powerful reason of "saving the nation," fully explain it, enlighten them with righteousness, and scold them three times as pigs who do not know the hatred of national subjugation.</p>
<p>(3) As for the third method, please forgive me for keeping it a secret from you, esteemed readers. If you want to know what the third method actually is, please wait until the entire "Volunteer Army" gathers in Qiqihar, then passes through Tomsk, and finally fights its way to our Shanghai, before I reveal it.</p>
<p>Market</p>
<p>Qinxing Foreign Firm Sells Artificial Limbs Qinxing Foreign Firm, No. 11, Gongpingfang, Gongping Road, Hongkou, specializes in selling artificial limbs. The materials are excellent and durable. All those who have purchased and used them are satisfied. The firm has recently manufactured a large batch of artificial limbs. The materials are more advanced than before, and the price is cheaper than imported goods. Those who wish to be fitted with these items should not miss the opportunity. For telephone inquiries about prices, please call 52598 for a detailed reply.</p>
<p>Three-Day Review Publication Herald A large number of small newspapers are established in Shanghai, with the largest number in the country, but very few are substantial and well-rounded. Now, it is heard that many new literary writers, in view of the needs of the times, intend to launch a "Three-Day Review," publishing various treatises and literary works, scheduled for publication on March 3. The content is brilliant, the interest is strong, and the ideas are novel, truly the only reading material for the youth. Those who know the inside story have praised it as the dawn of small newspapers. It is now known that the newspaper's correspondence office is located at Dongshuju, 4 Sima Road, in this city. The subscription price is one yuan and five jiao for half a year, and two yuan and eight jiao for a full year, postage included. The price is doubled for overseas.</p>

<p>— Sun Yihe</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Thank you, please help me solve a difficult problem! I am an employee of a somewhat foreign-style national goods store. Ten years ago, I left school and said goodbye to my parents to become an apprentice at this store. The colleagues in the store are all from this store's apprentices. Our master, that is, our boss, treats us very well on the surface; our monthly salary is only about ten yuan; but if you are short of expenses, he will agree to lend you ten or twenty yuan each month; sometimes when there are weddings or funerals in our family, he will never refuse to lend us two or three hundred yuan. How grateful we were at that time! Therefore, in these ten years, I have accumulated a debt of more than eight hundred yuan, and in the future, I estimate that I will still accumulate at least one hundred yuan each year! He accumulates the debts year after year in the account book; we also turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>This year, I found a position with a higher salary, so I pleaded with the boss, asking him to allow me to resign; unexpectedly, his reply sounded very benevolent and righteous, but in essence, it was very harmful. He said, "People look up to high mountains and water looks down to low places. Now that you have a better job, it is certainly inconvenient to keep you here; but my business has a small capital, and a debt of more than eight hundred yuan must be repaid by you in advance. Otherwise, please stay here and suffer for a while, because it is absolutely impossible to lend money to an unrelated person!" At this point, I realized that he was using the method of "house arrest"!</p>
<p>Editor, there is no future here for a lifetime! But I don't have the power to repay the debt first and then resign. As for deliberately doing a few things that violate store rules to make him fire me; I am not willing to try this shameless behavior. Then, do I have other ways to break through this prison of "house arrest"? (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Sun Yihe bows</p>
<p>Editor's note: We received Mr. Sun's letter and discussed it with many people who are experienced in the business world; we know that many shopkeepers are adopting this method of "house arrest." At the same time, we believe that although the methods adopted by these shopkeepers are erroneous, their motives cannot be erased. They at least have two good intentions: "love of talent" and "consideration." Therefore, we are specifically discussing it publicly here, hoping that shopkeepers with these good intentions will find other ways.</p>
<p>It is understandable that shopkeepers want their useful partners to work for them for a long time and not help other colleagues to become their strong enemies. However, the method of winning people over must be generous. If you can be considerate of their treatment, then people are not made of wood or stone, and they will of course do their best. If Mr. Sun's shopkeeper can openly and rightly use the money owed to each as salary, it can be calculated that Mr. Sun's monthly salary, except for the first three years of apprenticeship, can also be about thirty yuan per month. I think Mr. Sun can of course live in peace and will not have the idea of ​​seeing different and moving. Now, although he actually has an income of thirty yuan a month, because he nominally bears a large amount of debt, of course he feels uneasy and is eager to seek another job. Fortunately, Mr. Sun is a decent person, so he is not willing to deliberately violate store rules, otherwise you will regret it too late. We advise Mr. Sun to understand the shopkeeper's good intentions and negotiate with the boss once; add some to the previous salary, settle on the amount owed; and at the same time, please increase the salary in the future and set a method of repayment in installments. Then, such a considerate old master, the new master may not be able to surpass, you may wish to cancel the idea of ​​seeking another job. If he cannot do so, you can go to him. Fortunately, this kind of debt is the money he voluntarily lent, unlike the private collection of customer accounts and other money, which violates criminal law. The law is nothing more than human sentiment, even if you sue in court, it will at most be discounted and repaid in installments.</p>

<p>(V)</p>
<p>On Monday morning, the crushing sound, as if vehicles heavily loaded with bricks collided with each other, filled the entire city. Monday, the sound of explosions in the mine echoed in the valley. Monday, awakened the miners who were sleeping soundly in bed: urging them to put on their rubber shoes and move towards the mine.</p>
<p>Drinking, smoking, singing, Saturday night and Sunday, struggle and hope, earning money and spending money, constantly struggling in impoverished huts, paying rent, giving birth to children, workers being crushed or injured in the mine, old miners planning how to work in the mine to make a living 丨 Everything, everything, ended and started on Monday morning. The terrible whistle of the mine urged countless miners to send their priceless lives into the mine. The miners dug coal, digging with all their strength; the managers only hoped to obtain profits, more profits.</p>
<p>On that dismal Monday, the workers were not allowed to talk, they were as if sealed off and unable to speak. The newspapers were full of news of the recession 丨 the market was shrinking, but the managers and foremen were still frantically demanding coal. The ominous headline read: "No longer needed", which had already made the entire coal industry depressed; and this terrible phenomenon continued to spread. The period of layoffs had arrived: the workers were afraid of job insecurity, not knowing which day would be their last day of work. But, the urgent work of mining coal was still progressing; the hateful foreman frantically urged the workers to dig coal in sweat, and even more tons of coal.</p>
<p>Ten poor workers, boarding the elevator, they felt the cold wind coming from the darkness below. Trembling flames stretched out from the kerosene lamp. They listened quietly to the sound of running water, the spire of the house where the crusher was placed, showing a line of azure sky, heavy frost covered the track, uneven iron plates on the explosives room, oil room and ticket office 丨 the place where the workers checked their numbers when they went to work in the mine. The frost along the sloping roof of the crusher reflected the light. Tense silence filled everything.</p>
<p>Peter stood on the elevator covered with mud. In the trembling light, he looked at the thin and haggard faces of his companions. The bell rang, the elevator descended rapidly: a sharp sound rolled into the eardrum, and the brain also felt tense. The sound of iron chains, the sound of the elevator and the wooden strips next to it rubbing against each other, sent into the eardrum in bursts, descending, down. Until that dark and dangerous place; but, here are buried countless treasures∶∶∶∶∶∶.</p>
<p>Vehicles heavily loaded with coal were waiting below. The miners rushed through the curtain made by the rapids, stepping into the smelly tunnel. A cold wind came from the top of the tunnel. Peter followed a line of clear light and proceeded along the difficult tunnel. An old mule driving a cart stood in front, and a companion with a face covered with mud stood beside him, chewing bread. Peter ran to the small path that could only be walked by one person; when walking from there to another slope, he had to hold on to the wooden stakes tightly. The dim stones, as if angered by the light revealing their secrets, often stabbed the workers' hands; the rough wooden stakes also often hooked the workers'</p>
<p>clothes. Indescribable danger was tensely approaching in the darkness step by step. Darkness had its own life 丨 it had its own nightmares, sorrows, laughter, plans; terrible malice and bitter feelings; it would flatter people, ridicule people, caress people; poison people, destroy people. It was forever silent, except when sporadic stones rolled into</p>
<p>the tunnel, or when explosives exploded,</p>
