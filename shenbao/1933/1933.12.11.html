<h3>時評　徴收遺産税之商榷靈</h3>
<p>今日我國財政之困難。無論爲中央爲地方。均陷於不可收拾之境地。根本整理。固有待於全國政治之安定。而目前要圖。必以開源節流爲不易之原則。日前報載。孔財長飭部草擬徴收遺産税計劃。俟中央通過。即將實施。可見此舉勢在必辦。特早晚間耳。吾人抱增一税即人民加一負擔之意。以討論此問題。鮮有不欲作反對之議者。但審度利害輕重。似亦有可以贊同之意義焉。　　遺産徴税。歐美各國。行之已久。且税率極高。素爲各國税源之一大收入。其所具特點。約有三項。</p>
<p>一。税收本身。因其目的物－遺産之確實存在。可得按實核徴。以收極大利益。承繼人得此財産。多爲不勞而獲。亦可云爲分外所得。其應徴之能力。易於充賢固定。且遺産種類不同。税收可依彈性原則。按社會經濟發展之情勢。而隨時提高。</p>
<p>二。被徴性質。係就遺産所蓄力厚薄。以爲税收凖則。絶不至侵蝕春本身之實利。亦非若營業消費等税易於妨碍被徴者之生産經營。且承繼人之權利。因徴税得合法之保障。爭奪糾紛可免。尤有進者。彼積産自私者。席豐履厚。復爲子孫謀。貪婪無厭。而不知多藏適以厚亡。課以賦税。或可歛止其侈心。稍知自足。不以財賄子孫憂。爲子孫者亦可稍知自振。不敢依賴先人餘蔭。而不求自立。蓋徴收税賦之後。必將感覺遺産有限。不得不黽勉圖存嚮者徒爲消費之蠢蟲。今後不難變爲自立有爲之生産者。此庽征於教。亦一善法也。</p>
<p>三。財富本社會之脂膏。善營利者。吸收太甚。譬諸全部血液。集中一處。且成局部充血症。而其他部分。必將發現枯槁之貧血症。語云不患寡而患不均。不患貧而患不安。財聚於少數之富豪。天下必有餓殍不安者。人必貪欲。苟無紀綱法度以限制之。勢必因經濟上之畸形而陷於危險。所以漢興重租税以困富商大賈。當時謂千金之家。勢比一都之君。鉅萬者乃與王者同樂。故有平凖之法。亦矯正其太過而已。佛家言慳入餓鬼道。謂吝嗇資財。使人窮餓。死當受其報。故以布施度慳也。遺産税殆亦爲調劑盈虚疏散臃腫之一良法。</p>
<p>抑財政爲國家政治之泉源。政治休明。社會相安。在在有重大密切之關係。政府際茲外患内憂。世界經濟恐慌日深之日。開源途徑。已呈挖肉補瘡羅掘俱窮之勢。若欲增加其他任何税捐。胥與平民直接有關。而平民實不堪再加負擔之痛苦。今乃移其視線於華膴厚擁子孫世守之遺産上。開一税收之新紀元。一方與平民鮮關係。一方即爲有産者安坐徒食不治生理之惰民。予以絶大覺醒之路。吾人所以贊同此税法者。意在於此。而不僅爲政府闢一財源計也。</p>
<p>惟吾人尚有望於政府當局者。此種絶大之税收。第一須用於有裨國計民生之事業。實際上使國家得到利益。而不濫用於一切無謂之花費。第二。一切章程手續。須悉心詳愼釐訂。毋使經徴之人。得以因緣作弊。第三。將來於經徴官吏。須選擇潔己奉公之人。而勿使好猾者濫竽其間。如此始可望獲到實益。否則此種税收。正易上下其手。勾結舞弊。一有不愼。即可大啓糾紛。遺社會上以騷擾不安之根因。此則不可不預防者也。</p>

<h3>么對國聨基本改組　構築聨合陣線　比捷波蘭擁護法國宣言　彭古將東遊作政治連絡　意倡議别有雄圖</h3>
<p>比京昨日法國外長彭古對國聨會改革計畫發表宣言、明白陳述法國對此事之態度、比國政界聞之大爲欣慰、此間意見略有兩層、第一按國聨會盟約一切會員國對於盟約之若干條文、均有提議修改之權、惟以不妨害其根本原則爲條件、第二目下某某方面主張之改造國聨會計畫、並非以改良國聨會爲目的、乃係用爲一種手段、使各主要問題如修改和平條約之類、僅由若干大國主持、而不令其他國家參加、蓋按現行國聨會盟約、則小國亦有發言之權也、一般人謂英國政府反對減少各小國在國聨會之權利一層、亦爲此間人士所滿意、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>與國聨盟約何尤</h3>
<p>捷京外長貝勒斯對羅瓦某日報記者發表談話、論國聨會改造問題、渠意以爲（國聨會感遇之各種困難、旣不能歸咎於其組織之不良、亦不能歸咎於盟約之不完備、更不能責備盟約對於大國與小國關係規定之有未當、以故國聨會盟約縱加以修改、亦不能袪除其困難、而時局亦不能有所改進、吾人之志、在擁護現在之國聨會、吾人認爲國聨會盟約、爲現代政治學及政治實用之完滿表現、國際上之各種困難、實由於各大國之互相競爭、而今日困難之最大者、莫過各國政治制度之不同、如謂國聨會必須改造、則無異謂現在之國聨會應予以取銷、然以目下情形觀之、若國聨會一旦取銷、則國際狀况未有不陷於混亂者、此吾人所期期以爲不可者也）云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>波蘭對法表同情</h3>
<p>華沙法國外長彭古昨日曾對報界宣言、法國政策始終以國聨會爲根據、縱該會組織加以改革、亦不能妨害該會之根本原則、即全體國家之權利、悉應尊重是也、本日又傳法外長彭古擬至華沙莫斯科羅馬尼亞及捷克京城報聘、此間政界聆悉兩種消息、莫不爲之額手稱慶、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法報論調不一致</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法外長彭古星期五向報界申明法國篤守國聨主要原則後、各報論調不一、小巴黎人報拒絶修改盟約、謂祗須法英聨合以保衛國聨、則可受一切攻擊而安然無恙、巴黎廻聲報則譽彭古態度、謂種種徴象、似可表示法國外交政策將加以完全整理、向來國聨盟約之運用、不利於法國之利益、阻礙法國之行動、目下日内瓦之懈怠狀態、則有利於法、因可促成修改云云、赫禮歐之新時代報則對於法國力抗修改盟約之企圖、表示滿意、謂彭古之赴華沙與柏拉格、亦可證明一切道路不盡趨向羅馬、又著名記者白禮西在日報撰文、贊成彭古宣言之原則、但以爲必須另立一種制度、以代國聨、因現有之國聨已宣判死刑云、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>[P德國國會新選舉的前夜（歐洲通訉）列山&gt;</p>
<p>今天是個紀念節日、明天還是個紀念節日掛旗開會演講遊行口號、這是希特勒執政後德國唯一的特色、無論大街小巷、卍字旗幟、同紅白黑德國國旗老是隨風飄舞、全國報紙被統一了、不單是言論一致、并且大家還在力求剌激性的豐富、希特勒萬歲的聲音、就是人家踏進你房門的第一句話、褐衫的青年黨員、用行軍式的步伐、三三五五成羣、挺着胸在街道上來來云云、每個星期日、街上總少不了兜售徽章或花草、爲救濟某個團體的人員、而這幾乎每個轉灣街口都有的、因爲希特勒政治講義第一章、就是德國正在國難時期、人民應該盡力救濟、雖然頗有些愈救濟經濟愈窘迫之態、但據宣傳部長哥白爾的解釋、目前的德國人民、是世界上最幸福的人民、爲的有種信仰在前面、民間的感覺、顯然不很相同、似乎是誰能够創造麵包、誰就是救主、不過這完全帶着情感的刺激宣傳的力量、也就是希特勒成功的根本秘訣、到底能够維持多少時候呢、目前的確快要成爲問題了、</p>
<p>失業問題一天不解决、希特勒的地位就一天不算穏固、最近官方堂皇的佈告、説是失業人數、已減少到只剩三百七十萬的數目了、這顯然不易引起人民的相信、希特勒口口聲聲引爲自傲的、就是他曾經給過兩百二十多萬失業工人以工作、這里有個疑問、爲什麽增加了兩百多萬人的職業、而國家所得税的收入、並没有增加、爲什麽國家收到人民無數的志願捐欵後、而一般的經濟狀况、反不如從前、假如眞的失業人數是減少的話、難道還會有相反的結果、</p>
<p>人民是需要刺激、才會有熱狂、德國人民此刻正昏醉在這愛國熱中、做着他的德國再興的好夢、但也因爲是夢、就不免要有醒過來的時候、危險也就在此處、所以希特勒不能不變些新花樣、增加刺激力、并轉移人民的目標、對於退出國際聨盟并軍縮會議作用就在此、因爲希特勒不能無緣無故的突變他的政策、像一些手無寸鐵的女人、高談什麽（非戰）論調、他和定要有所藉口、然後使人家看來似乎、并不出於突然、然也因此、他對内的成分、就多過於對外、所以一面退出日内瓦、一面就向法國提議訂新條約、以表示德國絶無反對法國的野心、同時就解散國會、準備新選舉、并將此種政策、請人民票决、以緩和人民反對之心、而乘機更進一步、鞏固自己的政權、</p>
<p>這回選舉定十一月十二日、同時并舉行人民票决、辦法大體上仍舊、根本不同的、以前是多黨制、選民可以自由選擇、任意選舉、此次却是一黨制、所以選舉票上只有一黨的名字、而候補議員六百八十五人中、百分之九十以上是國家社會黨、這麽一來、選舉的結果、就不難一目瞭然了、</p>
<p>下面就是國會選舉票、并人民票决票、前者用白色紙條、後者用綠色紙條、國會選舉（某某區）○國家社會德國工人黨（希特勒運動）特希勒黑茲胡力克格林哥白爾羅恩塔勒塞爾德巴本胡根堡</p>
<p>德國政府敬告人民書！（德國政府并德國人民一致的志願，實行一種恊調同和平的政策………………）</p>
<p>（政府向德國人民提出一個問題；）</p>
<p>德國人民是否對於他的政府所實行的政策加以承認，同時是否當做自己的見解同自己的志願説明，而正式加以認可）柏林，一九三三年十月十四日德國政府</p>
<p>——————————你承認嗎，德國的男人并德國的女子，你的政府這種政策，你是否要把它當做自己的見解同自己的志願的説明，而正式對它加以認可？對○不對○　　國會選舉票、選民只須在圓圈内畫一十字或其他記號、就算做正式選舉了、人民票决票、選民在對字下的圓圈内畫一十字、卽作爲贊成票、如在另一圓圈内畫了十字、便是反對票了</p>
<p>歷來選舉、因爲有各黨互相競爭、選前氣象與此次大不相同、雖然希特勒對於此次選舉、根本就無所謂失敗的、但他并其他政府人員、仍須盡力點綴、使此事加重莊嚴性而不至於單調、十月二十四日希特勒在柏林作他的第一次選舉演説後、卽旅行全國各重要城市繼續演講、同時政府重要人員、如黑茲、胡力克、格林、哥白爾、巴本、輩、也是極力描畫、總括他們的意見、正如某個標語上所説的一樣、我們不願意戰爭、我們需要和平、我們需要安寗作文化并經濟的内部建設、或（我們需要一個光榮的軍備平等與和平、）和平、和平、目前在德國眞是一個再時髦也没有的名詞了、據他們的解釋、和平并不是對外屈服、第一因爲戰爭足殘酷的、希特勒説、只有前線的兵士、才明白戰爭是何等可怖、所以德國决不願意與法國重新有戰事發生、其次、戰爭足以揩殘一切的文化、特别是良好青年的喪失、此外還有赤色問題、并其他等等、所以在今日來説戰爭、是毫無意義的、所可惜的、希特勒的論調、在國外所引起的作用并不多、法國覺得此時不把德國解决掉、將來就更困難了、他們根本就不相信希特勒的話、國内一般印像、覺得他説了這麽一大套、終於還是免不了同法國妥恊、從前的政府、似乎比他還要高明得多了、這種見解、潛伏得頗普遍、不過在目前威力之下、不容易看出來罷了、</p>
<p>除了普通演説外、希特勒又特定十一月十日在柏林西門子工廠内、對工人作一回大演講、儀式是很隆重的、全國工廠在午後一時至二時間完全停工、各界人士均須在所屬的團體内集合、由無線電話中聽他的演説、從一時正起全國停止一分鐘、届時所有的工廠連接着放送汽笛、在熱閙的大街上、不管是汽車電車行人、經警察警棍一揮、一切立卽停止、完全入於靜寂的狀態、接着希特勒就開始同平常一樣的、作他的振盪人心的演説、但内容却仍相彷彿、只加重説明和平的志願、此次選舉的重要、并他曾經給過二百多萬人以工作并麵包、及階級恊調、與階級鬥爭的利弊等等、此外十一日并由興登堡總統、作一次最後的選舉演講、　　除了演講以外、全國的報紙、差不多一致動員、你决找不出德國有一家報紙會有另外的論調、大家總是異口同聲的尋出許多理由來證明、這次德國的選舉、并人民票决是德國命運的所繫、假如德國人民、要希望德國不受法國的侵略、赤化的摧毁、而達到再興的地步、惟有擁護希特勒爲德國而奮鬥和平、名譽與軍備平等的主張、在報紙上希特勒此日的地位、要比從前的俾斯麥高得多了、（我們的領袖）、（德國的解放者）、尤其是退出國聨一舉、很博得一部分人民的讚美、</p>
<p>文字宣傳以外、在報紙上還有不少插圖、大部分是説明敵人武備的充足、及德國國防的空虚、更特别對於婦女宣傳、説是將來德國的孩子們、都有受敵人飛機轟炸的危險、倘若德國的母親、要保護她們孩子的安全、惟有擁護希特勒的和平政策、</p>
<p>沿街道上、隨處都可以看到標語的招貼、最引人注意的、是興登堡與希特勒兩人的肖像、上有大字的標題、（大將軍（指興登堡）與伍長（指希特勒他在歐戰時曾作過上士）同爲我們和平并軍備平等而奮鬥）、有的是用極大字的標題、光榮的和平、接着用小字解釋希特勒政策、對内對外的意義、最切實的是一微帶粉紅色的標語招貼、大意是説、請看八個月來希特勒政府的成績、第一、給予了二百二十餘萬人以工作并麵包、第二、剷除了共産主義、第三、打倒了提倡階級爭鬥的政黨、第四、消滅了各小政黨、第五、使國内安靖、第六………、除此以外、選舉前數日、并有大規模的遊行、入夜則用多輛汽車、滿載國社黨青年黨員、配置以輝煌奪目的電燈、高唱黨歌、并喊口號、聲調悲將非常、并且這不只在大城市、就小村鎭也無不如是、德國人民、眞的被他帶情感的言詞所打動了、不過這批人民、能否長久受他的指揮、那却要看他今後處置的手腕如何了、自然、最重要的、還是在經濟方面、看他能否度過今年冬天這難關、</p>
<p>這次新國會選舉出來、不用説是全在國社黨的掌握、這絶不會有變更的餘地、人民票决、大約希特勒可獲贊成票百分之八九十以上、希特勒有一次説過、誰不參加選舉的人、誰就是賣國賊、德國人民此日大家本提心吊膽、那個敢去冒險、經希特勒此種聲明、連抱消極態度反對政府的人、也只好來參加選舉了、否則難免有危險、所以此次選民的數目、大約不會比前減少、希特勒此次選舉、除了他已有的羣衆外、一部分中立派亦受他的影響、許多人本身對於希特勒、并没有十分好感、但因爲宣傳的結果、説是此次人民票决、與外交有特别關係、許多人在反對法國的見地上、將投贊成票、另一方面、有小鄉村的人民、因地理并人數關係、他們無法投反對票、因極易被查出、所以百分中一二十的反對票、大約只在大城市中、例如柏林漢堡等處、無法區分、於是乎一部分反對派才敢明白表現出來、</p>
<p>這次選舉、對内的意義大約不外如上的所述對外的効用如何、此刻頗難預料、并許法國仍不滿意希特勒的讓步、要出兵佔領萊茵河一帶、那時問題就相當嚴重了、最近但澤事件所引起的緊張狀態、就證明法國人并没有覺得滿足、十一月十日夜歐陸</p>

<h3>往訪財孔會商財政</h3>

<h3>閩方聨共無從妥洽</h3>
<p>閩慶變亂、最痛心者、即爲十九路軍聨共一事、去年十九路軍調赴閩省、即爲剿共、今竟與共匪相勾結、與中央剿共政策、絶對背馳、致政治妥洽、無從下手、今閩方雖諱言聨共、然事實俱在、豈能掩盡天下人耳目、即謂軍事妥洽、而政治不妥洽、則蔣委員長累年剿匪包圍封鎖之功、已毁於一旦、且事實上、閩方盡最與共匪以物質的接濟、使匪死灰復燃、封鎖之匪、均以福建爲出路、使中央無從竟最後之功、其罪惡與共匪何異、</p>
<h3>解决閩事三項辦法</h3>
<p>中央對於解决閩局、决定三項辦法、即（一）將此次是非曲直、盡量爲公正之官傳、使全國民衆、完全明瞭、閩方政變、其表面口號、爲不滿意中央措施、本人係行政人員一分子、對於現在内政外交之措施、决不敢言滿意、但一切有話可説、如不滿中央、儘可用正當方法説明、决不能聨絡共産黨來倒中央也、（二）爲希望十九路軍自動起而校正叛逆之行動、蓋因十九路軍此次調閩、唯一之任務、即爲勦匪、今者反與共匪聨絡、故内部多表示反感、亟於待時反正也、（三）爲中央派軍凖備、即在閩省邊境、調駐重兵、嚴防叛軍亂竄、至於將來究竟先由中央軍先行向閩進攻、抑待閩軍侵北時予以痛擊、此乃軍事行動、本人未便表示、</p>
<h3>希望胡氏起而制閩</h3>
<p>胡展堂先生、向來堅决反對容共、故對於此次閩方聨共行爲、不應僅表示不贊成而止、應更進一步協助中央、共籌如何消滅閩亂之道、當民國十六年十二月十一日、張發奎部之一部份軍隊譁變聨共、陷佔廣州、張氏旋與陳公博諸氏、竭三晝夜之力、仍將粤省收復、張氏收復粤小之功、似可稍贖疏忽之罪、但胡展堂先生對於張氏、仍加以嚴厲之責備、茲者、閩方聨共叛黨、組府改元、其罪不僅心忽、故我人深望胡先生能起而設法消滅也、</p>
<h3>軍事當局决不能走</h3>
<p>西南方面前曾電京、要求軍政當局辭職、以求解决一切糾紛、惟本人以爲、軍事當局、致力於剿匪、刻方進展順利、設若一旦軍事當局離職、適爲共匪造機會、過去軍政集於一身、茲則軍政分治、决不能以軍政之責任、集於一身也、至於本人、則隨時可走、年來外交與内政、雖未做好、但此非人的問題、乃係辦法的問題、如誰有好的辦法、本人决可退而讓出、西南各中委、恒以（抗戰到底）相標榜、惟此乃志願、並非辦法、全國國民、現均同此志願、所要者乃辦法耳、更有進者、有了辦法、尚求願意擔當、如有了辦法而不願擔當則吾人之責任、將交與誰歟、故本人在有辦法與肯擔當的條件之下、隨時均可卸職、並願留京帮忙、即書記與錄事之卑職不顧也、惟軍事當局、則决不能走、</p>
<h3>張等南下所負使命</h3>
<p>張繼·馬超俊·各同志、此次南下、負有兩種使命、第一、爲敦促在西南各中委出席四中全會、第二爲商議解决閩亂辦法、閩方聨共、故西南决不致聨閩、但若閩方能放棄聨共政策、則爲另一問題矣、外傳西南主張在滬召開四中全會預備會之説、並非確詞、倘西南方面、如有此項提議、中央或可加以考慮總之、我人觀諸過去之歷史、决無借外力以倒政府、或借共匪之力以倒政府也、</p>
<h3>通車通郵並未進行</h3>
<p>華北通車通郵問題、始終並未進行、將來設若進行、自當公開、决不秘密、新疆督辦盛世才、與蘇俄訂約之事、眞相未明、刻正加以調查、如果有其事、中央當然决不承認、且對盛亦須加以懲罰也云云</p>
<h3>海軍部長　陳紹寛昨來滬</h3>
<p>昨晨召集會議海軍部長陳紹寛·常務次長李世甲·於前晚乘京滬特快夜車、於昨晨七時許抵滬、即乘汽車、赴高昌廟海軍司令部、上午八時、與政務次長兼第一艦隊司令陳季良·在司令部會商海軍處置閩方辦法、並召集駐滬各艦艇長曁參謀副官等、商議封鎖閩省各海口具體辦法、及至下午三時始散、至於會議結果、因事關機要、暫不發表、散會後、陳部長及李次長、即離海軍司令部、</p>
<h3>封鎖海口</h3>
<p>新聲社記者昨晤海軍新長陳紹寛、據稱、封銷閩省各海口、今已由魚雷艦隊司令王壽廷·及馬江要港司令李孟斌·率領逸仙等艦、在三都澳等處沿海檢查各進出口輪船、以杜絶閩方私運軍火及糧食等接濟品、至於厦門海軍飛機處等各機關、仍照常辦公、並未被閩方没收、地方尚安謚、</p>
<h3>海軍損失</h3>
<p>馬江自爲十九路軍佔去後、海軍各機關、如馬江造船所·海軍學校·海軍練營·長門砲臺等、均被佔去、海軍學校學生·練營學兵、已由閩到京安置、使學業不致中輟、除各機關文件及重要機件、當由李司令裝江元艦隨帶外、其他不動産及一切較大之機械、均爲没收、損失達七百萬元云云、</p>

<h3>劉維熾　否認代蔣赴粤　救濟國煤須减成本限外煤傾銷</h3>
<p>鋼鐵硫酸錏兩廠合同即將簽字新聲社云、實業部次長劉維熾氏、報載有與中委陳慶雲、代表蔣委員長赴粤接洽之説、新聲社記者、昨晨特訪劉氏於寓次、劉氏否認此説、茲將與其談話誌之如下</p>
<p>赴粤不確據劉氏云、報載余與陳委員代表蔣委員長赴粤之説、係不確、蓋中央已有張繼·王陸一·等諸委員赴粤、又何必再由余等前往、有謂陳委員（慶雲）係粤主席陳濟棠之代表、實屬猜測之詞、不過陳氏最近曾赴國外考察航空事業、故返國後、即赴贛向蔣委員長有所報告、日前並赴杭參觀航空學校、外間誤會、或即由此而起、余最近亦無赴贛之舉、自閩變發生後、余曾往謁蔣委員長一次、蔣委員長態度、固仍力主和平、但以閩方輕舉妄動、背叛黨國、不但脱離國民黨之立塲、且樹敵對行爲、故事實已非和平所能解决矣、現閩浙邊境、中央已有嚴密佈置、苟閩侵浙邊、自當予以迎頭痛擊、否則暫時可無軍事行動云云、</p>
<p>救濟國煤嗣謂、救濟國煤辦法、原係本人主辦、前者曾由實業部在京召集煤礦商人會議一次、决定原則數項、此次滬上煤商舉行會議、即係依據上次會議後之决定、由煤商自行召集會議、詳加研究一次、再由實舉部召開大會、决定救濟方針、故有謂陳部長今日亦列席會議之説、係不確、至於救濟國煤之先决條件、首在抵制外煤之傾銷、蓋現在外煤傾銷、不但無利潤可得、抑且賠本出售、故救濟原則、在政府方面、對於國煤、竭力使國營鐵路及招商局航運、减輕裝運價格、同時減免礦商捐税、以輕其成本、對於外煤實行徴收傾銷税、以防止其貶售、在煤商方面、設法減輕英開支、使煤之成本減輕、如減低經理及高級職員等之薪水等、務使國煤價格、低於外煤、庶能與外煤競爭、至前擬發行救濟煤業公債、以非根本之國、已取消矣、</p>
<p>鋼硫兩廠又謂、實業部舉辦之鋼鐵廠及硫酸錏廠、短期内均可簽字、鋼鐵廠之進行、因前者與德商喜望公司商洽時、凡廠内一切機器、皆由該公司完全由德運華供給、資本總額合國幣六千萬元、嗣經實業部通知德商、對於内部一切機件、須每件開具價目、經開出後、正由專家研究估計、約一星期後完竣、即可簽字、廠之地點、定本星期三由實業部會同參謀本部、在京參謀部開會討論後、即可决定、惟建築等籌備工程、恐須二年以上之時間、庶能正式開工、硫酸錏廠簽字之期亦已近、因該廠爲國内商人政府及外商合辦、前與外商接洽時、有英美兩方商人、究竟何方有利、尚在研究、一俟决定、即告成立、預期一年半、即可製造出品、</p>

<p>出席代表劉鴻生·江世榮·蔡克明·高松甫·費敏伯·王鑑青·陸兆麟·陳九如·徐致一·徐日厪·趙選青·曲建堂·周子源·黄潤書·趙廊如·紀清弼·黄貫一·項徴雲·等二十餘人、</p>

<h3>蔡聲白談救濟絲綢　應注重國内用途　全國産絲出口僅五分之一</h3>
<p>須加徴布疋呢絨進口税率新聲社云、實業部决於明年在滬召開生産會議、討論國貨産銷各問題、救濟各業之衰落、記者以國産蠶絲銷路税减市面一落千丈、生産會議時、必提案討論、特訪該會籌備委員美亞織綢廠總經理蔡聲白君、詢問綢廠業方面、對於國産蠶絲之救濟、有何辦法、及其個人有何意見、茲記其談話如下、</p>
<h3>衰落二因</h3>
<p>蔡君謂、我國絲業、年來一落千丈、原因有二、國内政局不安定、天災人禍、相繼而至、加以九一八·一二八·事件之襲擊、致社會經濟愈陷困窘、人民購買力薄弱、對於衣着添置布衣、尚費斟酌、遑有餘力、再購綢緞、此其一、國外貿易、因日本絲商操縱壟斷、而我在國外旣無自辦之售絲輔佐機關、各銀行堆棧輪船等、均動輙受人牽制、聽人宰割、加以品質絶少改良、遂不能與日絲相競、故生絲出口額、亦逐漸低落、此其二、</p>
<h3>絲業現况</h3>
<p>目前江浙兩省工廠一百八十七家、能勉强撑住門面者、不過十四五家、絲業之虧蝕者、總計已達兩千萬元以上、山東四川兩省、亦有繅絲廠一百數十家、廣東繅絲廠共有二百數十家、但現幾全部停頓、開工者不及十分之一、其損失亦在兩千萬元以上、其他如各地農民所産之土絲、其數量尤在機器繅絲額之上、但現在銷路已完全停頓、其損失在二三千萬之數、再不設法救濟、勢必全體破産、今農民已多鋤桑毁種、殆無絲毫勇氣、恢復其舊業、則袞袞諸公、即有藎謀碩劃、足以將絲業銷路起死而復生、而届時桑田已無餘株、蠶種均已枯蜕、雖欲繼續育蠶産絲、恐亦不可得矣、</p>
<h3>蠶絲産銷</h3>
<p>一般絲業中人、對　絲業衰落之觀察、咸注重於出口方面、故曾呈請政府、發八百萬絲公債救濟、但仍石沉大海、渺無效益、至織綢業則與絲業有指臂痛癢之關、且感覺自身近年來亦復衰落不堪、滬杭兩地之停閉綢廠、已指不勝屈、故一方面謀自身之發展、一方面尤願與絲業聨合在一條戰線上、共同奮鬭目前如欲救濟絲業、第一應先計劃如何可使其所生産之蠶絲、完全爲人銷用、查我國蠶絲各省統計、年産約有五十萬擔、前年度生絲出口、計由上海輸出者僅三萬餘搶、由廣州輸出者、亦祇四萬餘擔其他各埠輸出者、統共不過二萬餘擔、故其總數亦僅十萬擔、而銷納於國内者、則爲四十萬擔、故絲出口倘全部停頓、亦祗十萬擔而已、所感　於處置者、　銷國内之四十萬擔、逐年因國内經濟衰落之故、致積存於典當及銀行錢莊庫棧者、膨脹欲死、</p>
<h3>出口困難</h3>
<p>第一步、當先疏通此滯積、第二步方可繼續增加生産、但在國外因種種關係、銷售裝運匯兌存棧、在在皆需仰人鼻息、品質之優良、又不及日本絲、則欲求此積滯傾銷於國外者、寗非緣木求魚、設絲業與政府即能以全力謀出口發達、爲救濟絲業惟一之張本者、亦自必勞而無功、蓋前發八百萬之絲業公債、其效果如何、已可證明、</p>
<h3>注重内銷</h3>
<p>故應速謀如何使國内恢復銷用綢緞之原狀、方能達救濟之目的、至技術上之改良、則爲另一問題、目前國内絲銷停滯之唯一勁敵完全由於舶來布疋呢絨之暢銷、故一面又須將此種舶來品進口税率加重、使其不易暢銷、庶可使國産綢緞、在國内銷售、無荆棘牽掣之忠、蓋最近國綢之價、已十分低落、與舶來之布價、相差無幾、倘加提倡而減去其障礙、則銷路自易進步、國絲之滯積者、亦易於疏通也、綜之、欲救生産事業、必須力求消費方法、國産蠶絲、旣不能運銷於國外、當速設法用諸於本國、</p>
<h3>推廣用途</h3>
<p>蠶絲可以製綢緞綾羅、已人盡皆知、此外儘可研究以純絲仿造嗶嘰呢絨、以宏用途、日本今已研究得有相當成效、而我國則竟無人注意及之、即以綢緞綾羅而言、除製衣服外、亦可製造窗帘檯毯床圍椅墊等一切日用物品、倘加研究、爲用必廣、惟現各絲廠綢廠、夙夕徬徨惟在鈎稽調度經濟、自救燃眉之急、與環境相奮鬭、實無餘力自籌研究之方法、此則惟盼政府能速主持、邀同絲綢商及工業界、共同設立機關、聘請專家、潛心研究、如何銷費每年所生産五十萬擔蠶絲之方法、始克有濟、否則儘量謀生産、而不圖如何消費、實非妥善之策也、</p>
<h3>華東救國軍　函報義軍苦戰</h3>
<p>孫朝陽被捕致死全係言謡華東救國軍總指揮張志超、前託由北平參茸商黄寳生君、携函轉致駐滬代表張振東、報告該軍最近所佔領各縣、及進攻綏化、擾亂海倫·呼蘭·兩路、異常活躍、並附簡要地圖一幅、遠東社記者昨訪張氏於其寓次、所告各情如次、</p>
<h3>進攻綏化</h3>
<p>十一月八日夜半、日軍由木蘭、巴彦·啣枚疾至、包圍我軍王振琪王振芳兩部、其意殆欵將我軍一網打盡、旋被我軍發覺、遂與激戰、繼以肉搏、至九日拂曉、我軍始將西集廠收復、自此次日軍受創後、畏我如虎、旬日中、潛伏休養、不敢動、我部王振琪王傳道兩司令、見日人氣餒、機不可失、卽於前月二十日改道左翼、令大刀隊三百人、分途猛攻綏化、該縣日軍甚少、而僞軍較多、至發函時、我軍尚佔優勢、（本人昨接之函、係二十五日所發、）</p>
<h3>擾海呼綫</h3>
<p>我軍一面進攻綏化、一面仍令齊三江率部由西集廠出發、擾亂海倫路之海倫、呼蘭·兩路綫之日軍交通、使彼兩不相接、失其聨絡、則我軍收復綏化、易如反掌、因綏化居海倫呼蘭兩縣之中、形勢頗爲險要、</p>
<h3>改變番號</h3>
<p>查日軍遭受義軍迭次鉅創、死亡官兵無數、目其番號官兵符號姓名等、輙被義軍探悉、函報後方、揭諸報端、日人見之、認爲莫大恥辱、目下均已將其符號及番號一律改變、使義軍不能明其底藴、蓋日軍駐滿者、多係新募之卒、若被我方宣佈其敗續及死傷人數多寡姓名等、則士卒均存戒心後方家屬、亦引不安、而軍心離渙矣、</p>
<h3>擲彈轟炸</h3>
<p>九月初、嫩江·克山·訥河·布西·等縣、相繼發生民變、變民悉改充義軍、自後、哈埠日僞兩軍、一夕數驚、夜則派僞李炳文于大頭·兩軍輪流值夜、日軍自居腹地、以防義軍包襲、晝則派飛機五架一隊、或三架一隊、出没各地、故擲重量炸彈、爆炸者卽森林樹木、亦被燬壞、未炸者人民相率不敢相近、此種炸彈、最重者爲五百磅、最輕者亦爲二三百磅不等、</p>
<h3>俘虜人民</h3>
<p>最近兩月以來、據報告内載、日軍在哈埠一帶、俘虜我國人民、殘酷異常、男子在二十幾上下、虜去者均無下落、亦不知其用意所在、婦女則在十六歲以上三十歲以下、多被虜去、年輕者多被侮辱、年老者、爲彼縫洗、</p>
<h3>勒吃毒物</h3>
<p>不獨此也、凡我國同胞、在日僞軍勢力範圍内者、人民均須吃貪鴉片紅丸、食紅丸者每半月納税洋日金元半、食鴉片者納日金二元、每半年遞減十錢、此外種種捐税、名目繁多、不勝枚舉、卽此一端、足見日人用心、不獨欲亡我國家、且欲滅我種族、言之眞令人痛心、國人若不急起直追、早日收復失地、恐五年以後、卽欲求如今日之現狀者、亦不可得、</p>
<h3>孫部苦鬥</h3>

<h3>蔡正義進逸園時之姿勢（啓昌攝）　途中一瞥</h3>
<p>▲八時二十分開步昨晨陰雲四合、天黑欲雨、晨風刺骨、卡德路靜安寺路一帶、人頭攢動、不减已往競走之情景、而表示對於競走始終如一之熱烈、童子軍及捕房巡捕、來往逡巡、秩序井然、横跨靜安寺路、高懸半空、爲英文白布一張方、上書十二月十日八時、萬國競走在此起步、然而直至點名排列畢、下令開步走時、已八時二十分矣、</p>
<p>▲英國隊聲勢浩蕩浩浩蕩蕩、五十餘名健兒直向靜安寺路前進、捕房之機車、在前開道、捷步登先、爲首第一人爲英國之台維斯與其相差一肩者、亦爲英國之西朋過靜安寺走上極司非路、以至兆豐公園仍然不變、在西朋之後二十碼、則爲英國之法拉斯、在此最初之四英里中、英國隊三大將、保持爲首三人、聲勢浩蕩之極、</p>
<p>▲中華隊努力追遂越鐵道、過周家橋、白利南路路程爲三分之一、英國三將、仍然居首、而中華隊四大將、則相距不遠而緊緊追隨於後、其次爲牛格堡、愛凡列諾、曼南的、列壽、</p>
<p>[Ｐ&gt;李特夫人給奬（徐天章攝）&lt;Ｐ]</p>
<p>而不爲人所　　　冠軍蔡正義、則尚隠　於花後之一羣中、</p>
<p>▲虹橋路形勢突變白利南路折人羅别根路、在羅别根路之一里半中、可注意者、則蔡正義加緊脚步、已在追趕中矣、一越而升至第八人、居最先之西朋台維斯、則爲法拉斯壓倒、周如泉牛格堡愛凡諾等次之、羅别根路復向西上虹橋路、形勢乃大變特變、</p>
<p>▲蔡正義一路順風旣上虹橋路、蔡正義愈走愈快、已一躍而升上第三名、超出愛凡列諾·西朋·曼南的、英雄聲色、不飛則已、一飛冲天、虹橋路中段、蔡竟一冲而壓倒羣雄、過海格路交通大學、蔡已抛落西朋等四五十碼、於是一路順風、直向逸園而進距第二名有五六百碼</p>
<p>▲中華隊又獲冠軍中華隊四騎士呂崇義·呂文俠·周如泉·張造九、打成一氣、以　靜工夫、在起先毫不因英國之氣勢而餒、經最後之努力、除西朋之外、台維斯·法維斯·皆抛落於十數名之後、法意成績之佳、殊出人意料之外、最後乃由李特大尉夫人、在逸園當塲給奬、中華選手、滿載而歸、英國金氏得程貽澤氏之姿勢銀杯、姿勢最佳也、</p>

<h3>棒球塲内萬人觀戰　東華勝伊令優游和曁南　＝東華得史高塔杯複賽權＝　＝優游先敗後和結果各二＝</h3>
<p>上海著名華人足球隊東華優游曁南等、昨日不期而然同在中華棒球塲出戰、千載難逢之機、加以久客天南婦孺皆曉之名將戴麟經、亦適於其時、應召參加、一次解囊、兩幕球賽、天下最便宜之事、無逾於斯焉、於是棒球塲大交紅運、中西老幼、滿坐四周、數在萬人之上、熱閙狀况、幾與晨間逸園萬國競走絲點時相彷彿、東華伊令首先登場、兩隊勝負之數、固無待言、然以伊令抵抗劇烈、上半時拒人千里之外、使東華爲之寒心、最後東華奮起、連拔五城、卒克强敵、得史高塔杯複賽權、曁南優游一役、繼之以起、雙方勇武精神、濟以柔和脚頭、戰來清晣可觀、各二比數、和平了結、</p>
<h3>東華克服伊令　＝結果五對零＝　＝勝在下半時＝　變陣線東華得勢</h3>
<p>戴麟經久别重逢、豐采依然、上半時、位非素習、不克見長、而前鋒力量、亦因之大減、下半時、回任原職、活　異常、中鋒得人、乃連得五球、終獲勝利、内部馮運佑缺席、以屠代之、另邀馮念漢任左前衛、此馮不如那馮、防守不固、敵人不絶侵入、成多事之秋、周賢言李寗關洵安健穏如故、得以平安過去、前鋒戴麟經之外、要以萬象華厥功最巨、陳洪光則以努力見稱、陳虞添頗盡人事、李羣臣過於謹愼</p>
<h3>假風威伊令失敗</h3>
<p>伊令乙組中之第二流球隊、不料是日表演之佳、直令人爲之驚駭、右翼佛來風鋒芒一時、有隙卽入、中堅保爾台八面威風、無暇可擊、守門克羅斯亦係往昔名將之一、所失五球、非渠之咎、獨惜上半時假風施威之秋、無所建樹、而下半時一球失後又復鋭氣頓墮、不克自振、失敗固應所得、但形勢不致如此耳、</p>
<h3>勇李寗兩度拒敵</h3>
<p>何春暉銀笛一鳴、東華戰士得開球權利、卽撥動進攻、數度來回、西看台之伊令隊聲援者羣起呐喊助威、前鋒勇氣百倍、馮念漢西門大空、佛來風脚下　風、霎時闖入東華宮闈禁地、周鐵門鵠立以待、形勢頗爲危急幸李寗立時趕到、砰然一脚、球乃出險、俄而法凡沙在開球綫刦得來球、交與郵　、飛馳而進、東華後防、關無一人、李寗距離　　、急返身追上回馬一槍、彩起四産、</p>
<h3>好伊令防衛森嚴</h3>
<p>不轉瞬、陳虞添主開角球、屠開元急不能待、横掃一脚、遂成野球、李義臣捲土重來、再射不中、麥克拉一軍奮起、風霎變色、立刻殺過東華三關、舉脚叩門、準而且急、周氏如弄嬰兒、接住送出、佛來風角球開出端線、喪氣而回、李義臣頭上擺渡、戴麟經搬近數武、勃羅尼無法擋駕遂逼成角球、虞添開來、自有方寸、戴麟經躍起一頂、正中克羅斯手内、未幾東華五虎、包圍敵門、形勢緊張、然而一再進窺、終至失望者、非東華不力、實伊令防嚴森嚴耳、</p>
<h3>萬象華驚倒四塵</h3>
<p>四十五分鐘光陰、如飛逝去、休息後互易陣地、陳華前鋒小有調動、戴氏回任中鋒、義臣與陳洪光對調、聨絡驟見純熟、返顧悍不畏死之伊令中衛線諸將、均有力竭汗喘之現象、開球後、戴氏與義臣、並駕齊驅、象華得縫卽鑽、急有且猛、利那間已抵敵人低線、抄人中路、在三十五碼處、一脚横掃、克多斯措手不及、紀錄遂開、</p>
<h3>戴麟經神威重見</h3>
<p>東華得一球後、聲勢益見浩大、前鋒五虎、張牙舞爪、出没敵陣、如人無人之境、保爾台前門拒虎、克羅斯後門遇狼、形勢所謂十二分尶𡯓屠開元輸送砲彈、陳洪光涓滴歸公、戴氏得球、載欣載奔、轉過保爾台、勃羅斯凶狠狠迎來、麟經横身一掃、球從勃氏脚邊竄過、斜飛入網、乾脆異常、</p>
<h3>李義臣坐收其成</h3>
<p>伊令諸君子、至此莫不怒氣溢於眉宇、佛來風驃屬可見、處此逆境、猶能作困獸之鬥、盤人後防、一脚傳中、伊格萊遲一步、周賢言撲地捧出、戴氏立刻與象華反攻、遥射爲克羅斯接任、曾幾何時、伊令城内、又見東華旗幟、到處飛揚萬氏得球傳中、李義臣接住、軋脱雷一衝不着、李氏故示大方、逃過此關、對鬥力射、又奏膚功、成三對零、</p>
<h3>五對零大功告成</h3>
<p>吳幼良在罰球線外、撞人犯規、保爾台力射、中横柱彈出、伊格萊右傳之二章、周鑅門賣弄手脚、絶無舛錯、屠博士刀圭奏效、又飛人對方、李義臣横傳與戴氏、立刻又人三道防線、勃軋二守將兩馬夾攻、仍不免破網之傷、被戴射中、可謂苦矣、障供光見諸兄弟均建奇功、自勉自勵、與虞添義臣互相提携、攪得敵人眼光撩亂、終被其攫得一球而去、成五與○之比、</p>

<h3>曁南優游和局</h3>
<p>＝▲結果二對二＝　　＝▲滿塲和平聲＝</p>
<h3>成和局工力適敵</h3>
<p>東華大勝伊令之後、優曁兩隊國軍相繼登透奉擄袖、列陣交鋒、優游隊中不少曁南老將、兄弟相逢、全塲空氣、滿佈和平氣象、然以雙方競競自守、表演反不若平時精彩、曁南徐亞輝優游江善敬、始終有聲有色、全場贊美、奚巧生福生心靈、兩球之獲、一身造成、結果二對二和局、</p>
<h3>陳鎭祥遠射建功</h3>
<p>此塲裁判係由西人海姆擔任、鳴笛之後曁南卽取攻勢、陳鎭祥督率三軍、節節進逼、黄瑞華殺退一陣、莊世鴻又在東郊拚命、王南珍逃不過此關、乃傳入中路交付亞輝、江善敬來搶、亞輝倒傳與鎭祥、在四十碼處、碎然一聲、球如砲彈、自高落下、正切門柱而人、唐永純竟瞠目結舌、無法拒絶、遂失一球、</p>
<h3>周紹文登堂入室</h3>
<p>優游此球之失、殊屬意料所不及、乃下令反攻、孫錦順與顧尚勷拚賽五十米、球爲李氏所得、挑入中路、在門前落下、徐亨被誘衝出、賴氏反勾不得、危急萬分、幸徐亨轉身托出、頗含排球韵味、球迷大爲激賞、鄧漢傑帶出阿斗、遥遞亞輝、再入優游後防、被江陸困住、周紹文乘人不備、打入一球、成二對零、</p>
<h3>奚巧生射破龍門</h3>
<p>此時曁南之聲勢、有靈手之熱之慨、優游内防、神鬼不安、時時有漏潰之危險、幸有江善敬之大刀闊斧、尚能狂殺一陣、黄瑞華從横路抄出、阻止亞輝前這、得球卽交錦順、盤過中綫、後防告急、賴作榮還踢不遠、爲奚巧生所得、奮勇邁進、闖至門前、力射入門、成二對一局面、未幾上半時亦告終了、</p>
<h3>二對二平分秋色</h3>
<p>休息後、雙方舉動遲鈍、不思奮遺、往來塲中良久、各無所獲、黄瑞華監視徐亞輝、而陳鎭祥亦出全力看守孫鐵腿、雙方主帥、不能發揮其權威、故作戰經過、精神不多、直至最後五分鐘、優游始竭智殫力、傾師來攻、奚巧生得全軍之齊、再得一球、造成和局、</p>

<h3>應聲蟲</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>不知在那部書程看到下述的一樁故事，至今遷記着。某甲患着一種奇症。這症，也不是像羊頭瘋之類值得人家驚駭的。他，飯也吃得下，糞也撒得出，起居一切，都如常；所不同者，他嘴裡偶説一句話，腹中便好像有傳聲機般的會得學説一句。這症，歷問醫家，均莫知其所以然。後來某甲幸而遷着一位名説醫説，這是腹中有個應聲蟲在那裡作崇，便呌某甲天天把本草網目上所載的藥名一味一味地讀下去，如果讀至某藥，腹中　聲寂然；那末，這藥便是應聲蟲的尅星，可以治之。某甲依言，其病果愈。　　這段故事，是否眞確，我們可不必去細考它。可是你放眼一瞧，現在社會上的（應聲蟲，竟多得如恒河之沙，要數也數不清了。這是值得我們詫歎的。</p>
<p>下屬見了上司，上司説，東），他也祇好説（東）；上司説（西），他也祇好説（西）；即使上司説（糞是香的），他又怎敢不説（糞是香的）听？這便是一個例。</p>
<p>還有，甲有一種主張，乙丙丁之流必起而附和之。子有一種主張，丑寅卯之流亦然。如果甲的主張朝失敗，那末乙丙丁之流必轉而附和子。子的主張失敗，丑寅卯之流亦然。這種事是數見不鮮的，不又是一個例？</p>
<p>現在社會上唯唯諾諾，相習成風。這的確是一種病象。總説一句，（應聲蟲）實在太多了，但不知何時可以遇着（尅星）！</p>
<h3>二頭四手</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>前幾天看見本報，載有新聞一則，題曰（二頭四手怪胎），説是本埠住在高郎橋底胡家宅附近鄉民洪姓的妻，懷姙七八個月，突於那一天分娩：可是他腹中的胎兒，輾轉不下。就是舊式的穏婆在旁，一時也束手無法取得；末了，家人惶急，祇得去延請虹口某醫院兩位女醫生到門診治，經診察所得，斷定是難産，尤其是居室湫隘，設備不周，儻要施用手術，這是限於地位，萬不可能；於是遂送至醫院裏，詎料産下二頭四手的畸形怪物，舉室大驚，而家屬輩都以爲不祥，醫生等也詫爲未見，議論不一；據説這個怪胎，現尚陳列在提籃橋某醫院内，以供生理學家的研究，近來（豬能生象），（羊能産人），而（一胎三孩），（一産五子），皆生得（怪形怪狀），而且也有（面分青紅黑白），方才（墮地而能説話）的，亦都載在報紙，像煞言之鑿鑿，並不是杜造出來的，這不是很奇怪的一件罕聞麽？　　吾們嘉定南門外集慶寺東南周家橋，也有某鄉農的妻，前天産了一奇胎，據説這奇孩的頭頂，不是（圓）的而（扁）的，那（雙目）生在（額角上面），滾溜溜的翻在頭爿骨裏，嚇得一家老小，都要逃走到門外，且這奇孩的（兩手），長可（過膝下一寸許多），倒像是一個極貴的帝王格局；可惜社會上俗見，若遇到這種（畸形怪胎），從來没有人敢撫養過；所以待到出世，都抛在荒野裏，免得人家來爭觀，踏破門限受累呢！我説不是，中間關於善人橋的，有幾樁實例，都是經過辦事者的訪問，而得到感興實效的。犖犖大端，如戽水養蠶等生産的放貸，農民最得實惠，利息至多一分三厘。（大約是問息）教育的成績也不差，二十年度就學人數一五五人，二十一年度就有四二一人，增加三倍。尤其是修理三堰五閘，更有利於灌溉，張雲搏先生撰有重修穹窿山五閘記，工作時（只給酒資，不計傭值。）所以事半功倍。這地方蔚成善良風俗，那麽善人橋可以名副其實了。</p>
<p>都市已成了不可救藥的病體。但是農村經濟衰落，耕者有其田而不能享受，都企慕着都市，漸漸地離開農村而到都市裏來了。倘然再不替農民闢些生路，勢必都市也隨着農村而崩潰。所以改進農村，確乎是目前當務之急，我希望國内的資産階級，和金融團體，連絡起來，向農村去開發，這是利人利己的事。我每聽到小地主愁着米價低落，租米收入，不足應付生活，覺得這是束手待斃的現象，應該起來活動活動纔是。</p>
<p>我更佩服辦理農村改進的人，不辭勞怨，像墾荒一般的工作。可是我不贊成他們所主張（祗需農友得有實際利益，正不必在外界力事宣傳。）我以爲這種有實際利益的事業，正應當大事宣傳，好教大衆興奮，把這僅有的種子，廣佈這樣，像古代講起來，不要説（二頭四手），就是（三頭八臂）或（三頭六臂），載在（法苑珠林），可見得也一定子虚烏有的文章；虞舜兩目的（重瞳），夏禹兩耳的（三漏），商湯的兩臂（四肘），倉頡的部（四乳），還有周公的手（反握），晋文公的肩（駢脅），都是歷史上的有名人物；不但吾們中國，外國也有（兩頭一足）（四耳七指）（三足一手）的怪人，不過中國以前和現在外國，到會拿這種（奇胎）養大了，也並不見得什麽不祥，唉！我以爲研究生理學的，須得警告他們，先破除了迷信，應當鄭重地去撫養，非但是一樁好生之德，而且也就是優生學家當盡的進一步工作！</p>
<h3>善人橋名副其實</h3>
<p>— 烟格</p>
<p>前天接到善人橋農村改進會辦事部的一封信，對於拙作新村，有所糾正，説是（以改進農村生活，促成鄉村自治爲宗旨，而以農蠶合作水利等事業爲中心，教育事業爲推進工具，不是用全力在教育。）還寄給我一本小册子到枯瘠的農村裏去，使得到繁榮，所以我不嫌辭費，再來曉舌。　　不過拙作説：（没有堅固的教育基礎，儘有崇高富麗的建築物，不久就得崩毁的。）所謂建築物，當然不是簡單地只指着土工程而言，當然包括一切精神建設在内。這一點改進會辦事部有些兒誤會，附帶在這裏聲明一下！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>江氏原想着桂枝是個傾心甘二爺這路斯文人的，對於趙自强這種軍人，總有些勉强。現在　聽他的口音，居然肯同趙自强到口外去過日子，似乎不怎樣厭棄軍人了。於是文接着道：祇要你們自己願意那樣辦，我們也就很歡喜呀。桂枝耳朶聽了母親説話，手上就一頁一頁的向後翻展着。一小本圖畫書，共有幾頁？他隨便一翻就完了。翻完之後，没有什麽可以借來搭訕的，於是放下本子，微閉了眼睛，作個養神的樣子，依然伸了手，到枕頭下面去掏書本。他手上掏出了一樣東西，也不考慮，隨便的就舉起來看。一看之後，不由臉上一紅，立刻又向枕頭下面，塞了進去。江氏雖然坐在對面，却是半偏了臉的，對於桂枝這種舉動，似乎看見，似乎也不看見，桂枝向母親那邊，斜着眼睛看了一看，祇管把手上拿出來的東西，極力的向枕頭下面塞了去。江氏原先不注意，看到桂枝這種樣子，倒在他心裏擱上了一道痕跡，當時也不曾作聲，自收拾了屋子一番，倒了一碗熱茶，坐到一邊去喝着。約莫有一小時之久，在外面屋子裏，隔了門簾縫，向裏面張望了一下，祗見桂枝半側了身子，眼睛簇擁着睫毛成了一條　，鼻子裏呼呼有聲，大槪是睡熟了。於是悄悄的向屋子裏走了來輕輕呌了兩聲姑娘。桂枝依然微微帶着鼾聲，却並没有答應。江氏見他不作聲。索興走到坑邊，兩手按了坑沿，向着他臉上呌了兩聲桂枝。他似乎聽見，又似乎不聽見，鼻子裏哼哼喞喞一陣，然後翻了一個身，又睡着了。（二六四）</p>

<p>弱肉强食，大魚吞小魚，原是無庸諱言；但瘦的一定要讓胖的，實在有些不信；兩個不夠，三個四個瘦的，不也抵得一個胖的力量嗎？</p>
<p>别的不講，總之：如果胖的一定依持他的胖力去侵略旁邊的瘦，在人的心理，當給瘦的可憐和希望能也胖些是至少的事。</p>
<p>例如少買些（舶來品），增加國家力量，就彷彿進補了瘦的，做了事實的不平鳴。</p>

<h3>菊話</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>菊是合瓣花類的菊科植物，種類很多，一年四季都有，花放在秋末冬初的，爲最有名，昔人（菊譜），説有一百六十三品之多。像梧桐的玄參科，續斷的唇形科，烟草的茄科，葫蘆的忍冬科瓜類的葫蘆科，都是合瓣花類植物，不過一枝上都是單花；菊類是複花，集了無數花冠，瞧過去便成了一朶花了。像牛蒡，茼蒿，蒲公英，向日葵，紫苑，蒼朮，欵冬，蒿苴，紅藍花，薊，艾，野菊，波斯菊……等等，或可入藥，成供觀賞，都是菊的同類呀　　菊的名稱，由來很早，禮月令道：（季秋之月，鞠有黄花，一堆　道：（菊本作鞠，鞠者，窮也；言花事至此而窮盡也。）到了戰國，屈平離騷文中，有一朝飲木蘭之墜露兮，夕餐秋菊之落英。）漢武帝秋風辭中　，也有（蘭有秀兮菊有芳，懷佳人兮不能忘！）菊之見重於世，不是很早的麽？後來晉代的陶淵明，尤其是菊的知已，菊之身價，因此高了十倍。陶先生愛菊成癖，做了不少的詩；甚麽（采菊東籬下，悠然見南山，此中有眞意，欲辨已忘言。二菊爲制頽齡。）（三徑就荒，松菊猶存。）到了唐代，詩家咏菊很多，元微之道：（不是花中偏愛菊，此花開盡更無花。）杜牧之道：（塵世難逢開口笑，菊花須揷滿頭歸！）盧倫道：（願比三花秀，百同百卉秋。）（采采黄金花，何由滿衣袖。）李易安詞道：（簾捲西風，人似黄花瘦！）宋人咏菊詩的也很多，蘇東坡道：（）菊殘猶有傲霜枝。）李彦平道：（不羞老圃秋容淡，猶有寒花晚節香。）王荆公道：（黄昏風雨打園林，殘菊飄零滿地金。）歐陽永叔戯續道：（秋花不比春花落，爲報詩人仔細看）。此外，這時候，像范至能，史正志諸人，都做了（菊譜，）可知菊花從古至今，都交着紅運啊　　菊爲什麽爲人所愛呢？原來它挺寒獨秀，澹雅而有逸致，不是高人雅十的影子，也是幽嫺淑靜女子的化身，那能使人不愛呢！它有紅的，白的，黄的，紫的各色的花，秋光明媚，東籬晚艷，獨挺孤標，自矜風姿，我們生當亂世，菊花不是一個好伴侶嗎？周茂叔道：（菊爲隠士，連爲君子，牡丹是富貴的人。）目下的人，喜歡牡丹的多，喜歡菊的，雖也不少，可是使菊植在繁華的都市，令隠士陳列在商場，開展覽會，不但使黄花憔悴無色，難道是隠士眅</p>
<p>所情願的嗎？</p>
<p>菊不單是可供賣玩，并且可以治病：葛洪抱朴子道：（丹法用菊花汁。）陶隠居道：（白菊療疾有功。）蘇東坡道：（香味和正，花葉根實，皆長生藥也。）漢代宮人，採了菊花和酒浸了，到來年九月九日，取出後飲了，名喚一菊花酒，）以爲可以長生。所以古人又説：（茱萸爲（辟邪翁），菊花爲（延齡客。）重九置酒高會，競賞菊花，都是這個典故呀。菊還可以佩，雖説是辟邪，其實幽雅的香氣，可以醒腦養神。王次加詩道：（隠　香淡菊堪添。）便是説把菊儲在囊裡枕中，很有益於人呀。（澄懷錄，秋采甘菊花，貯以布囊，作枕用，能清頭目，去邪穢。）</p>
<p>女人以（菊）爲芳名的很多，取其清嚴幽雅，如其人呀。宋高宗時候，宮中有菊夫人，善歌舞，妙音律，宮中稱伊喚做（菊部頭），這很可以和唐代的梨園子弟）媲美，不是（菊史中的佳話麽？</p>

<h3>問病討藥之不當</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>（問病討藥）四個字。在中國社會上。起先也認爲不妥當。而含着譏諷意思的。差不多就和（説眞方賣假藥）一類口吻相似。但是因爲國人的懶動性。和忽視醫藥的心理。居然漸漸由譏諷的口調。變成了習慣的事實。以致常人有了小病。往往省得就醫。實行其問病討藥的方法。來解决疾苦。雖然也有許多例子。是幸中偶合。結果良好。然而細考起來。到底大有流弊。我如今把歷來問病討藥的各項方式分述在下面。</p>
<p>（一）向賣藥的人説明病象而買藥。所以藥店夥就成爲大半個醫生。</p>
<p>（二）經醫生診治過的病人。怕復診的跋涉。託人代向醫生叙述病勢。而索開藥方。俗稱呌作（轉方）。　　（三）挽近中醫。異想天開。由轉方的格式。一變而爲通信治療。郵函論證。</p>
<p>（四）向乩壇神廟。求取仙方香灰之外。居然也討得一張紅紙的藥方。照樣向藥店去配服。</p>
<p>（五）舊醫醫報上。特闢論證給方一欄的文字。　　（六）西藥充斥市廛。藥商除普通家用藥品之外。竟將主治重症的藥品説明書。也向民衆宣傳。並出了些類似騐方新編的刊物。病家也就向書中去問病索藥。所以近來頗有人。連注射藥品。都不經醫生之手。自行注射。或者向醫生那裏得了初步的診斷。就向藥房去亂淘治法。</p>
<p>（十）各日報上的醫藥刊物。往往有醫藥顧問一欄。簡直替讀者立方治病。</p>
<p>（八）少數醫藥雜誌。也有類似上述的辦法。其他雜誌。像前數年的家庭雜誌。就有衛生顧問一樣。近今的珊瑚雜誌。就有健康談座一欄。都變了問病討藥的機關。</p>
<p>以上數項。除第一至第六項的作用。我不敢代爲聲明外。七八兩項最先的宗旨。都並不是呌人問病討藥的。在當時。原爲引起讀者興趣。打算指示讀者些衛生常識。家用醫藥。求醫途徑。養生方法等等。例如某人正在服一種補品。問問久暫，服量，利弊。或則疾病已經斷定。問問療養方法。預後吉凶等等而已。不料事實不是這樣發現着。自有許多投函的。竟絶對以頗有出入的問題。狠嚴重的症候。也向報章雜誌上來問。於是主持這一項的醫師。就非常爲難了。假使説（照來函所述之症。確爲某某病。只要買某某藥服之用之）。就被内行駡一句荒唐。假使説（似爲某某病可用某藥試之）。又被内行駡一句武斷。假使説（來函所述證候須請專家治療成請速就醫診察）又被投函的駡他無學假使説（來函叙述欠明不敢臆測）。又被投函者失望。總而言之。醫家若讀書愈多。臨症愈久。確乎愈不肯經易置答。凡事耳聞怎比目見。而况疾病裏面。如腥紅熱與痧子，風痧，第四種疹子。在比較症斷上相差有限。用藥大異。惡性癌腫。與善性腫瘍。吉凶大不同。胃癌，胃潰，與神經性胃病，又復類似之處甚多。紅眼睛就有幾十種原因。肚子痛往往亦關生死。外瘍症也可牽涉花柳。皮膚病更千奇百怪。一切症象。豈是病家所能描寫陳述得盡的。毫釐千里。人命關天。呌醫家如何敢下筆。偏偏病家投函。往往是（ＸＸ於去歲害眼後。右眼下腫了一塊。按之甚硬。久而不愈。請問有無治療之方？）。又（報紙廣告中。有馬寳治痴如神。惟馬寳一物甚爲難得。如係贋品。服之有無妨礙？）。又（ＸＸ因憂鬱不快。乳上生一物。硬如塊狀。漸見紅腫起泡。且時有膿血。患處如銀元大小。此症經中西醫診治未效。敢問有何法可治？）。一類的問案。旣簡單又模糊。醫家更無從着手答復呢。舊醫的診斷法。是否可以函郵解决。是否可以通信治療。我不去管他。如今先把新醫診斷疾病的條件。詳細寫在下面。讀者當知問病討藥的不妥當了。　　下文係初習診斷之所必讀的課本上抄下來的</p>

<h3>中國肺病之危機及當今之急圖（下）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>此外則有父執吳稚暉先生等發起之中國肺病學會，其起點在於前年隨吳先生及家父考察本埠近郊地點，以爲建築　　　之用，吳先生謂療養院雖爲現時　需要之建設，但以傷人之力，至多收容五十人至百人之末位而已，以我國病肺者之衆，誠如滄海之一票，子志雖善，其如善天下之患者何，家父然其言，因廣延國内故舊爲之提倡，籌設該會，其主要工作如下。</p>
<p>（甲）用通俗淺顯文字，印行關於各種肺病之印刷物，分贈各界，其已出版者，有肺病預防法，肺病療養法，肺病指兩，肺癆特效療法等小册子，廣爲傳佈，以期普及民衆。同時通函全國各報，關於肺病之各種學説，以及預防要識，請其盡量刊布，以收宣傳之效。</p>
<p>（乙）通函各縣各區，設立預防肺病研究會，其工作不外爲文字宣傳及演講宣傳，如是則於個人衛生家族衛生公衆衛生，必能收逐漸改進之效。惟此非一朝一夕所能致。必須羣策羣力，積以時日，方克有成。</p>
<p>（丙）勸各地籌設肺病療養院（詳見第四項）</p>
<p>（丁）答覆各地會員，或患者來函，凡關於本會進行事項，或患者調理醫治方法，有所咨詢者，由該會延請專家答覆之，以期稍義務於社會。</p>
<p>總之，使人人俱知預防及正當療養之方法，則不致爲庸醫僞藥所誤矣。</p>
<p>以上均爲撲滅結核政策中所不容緩者。李廷安君曾有將兩會合併，以期集中力量，共同爲社會服務之議，至坡欽佩。人或以爲肺病學會，必由專家發起，方克有濟，實則發起與主持有異，若肺病研究院，則誠然非專家主持不可，然其成立之匪易，已如前述。至於肺病研究會，則各地各鄉熱心公益衛生之士，俱應負責發起，設有難以解决之事發生，則再請專家研究，未爲遲也。綜而言之，各地設立預防肺病研究會，實爲刻不容緩之事，且輕而易舉，收效可期，甚望熱心之士，有以提倡之也。</p>
<p>（四）各地籌設肺病療養院各國在人口五萬以上之都會，大抵有肺病療養院之設立，吾國宜師其法，或由地方政府，或由公共團體，或由個人籌備，均無不可。但每院至少應有愛克司光機一座，及人工氣胸手術之設備。</p>
<p>肺病患者之必須住院療餐，其重要之意義，有下列之兩點。</p>
<p>一、將各人之抵抗力增高</p>
<p>二、將傳染之危險减少</p>
<p>挪威自一千九百年政府公佈，凡肺病患者必須住院療養，以免環境受害以來，至今已三十年，其死亡數已逐漸減少。惟據其國對於現時住院患者之調查，則什九爲政府所强制，蓋肺病患者之須住院療養，在病者個人及社會健康，均有莫大之關係，非由政府之力量以主持之，不足以收宏效也。但我國財政竭蹶，一切建設，均落人後，已略如前述。然以肺病蔓延之廣，實爲我國現代最嚴重之病症，又豈容坐視。爰不揣棉薄，在七年前即籌設上海肺病療養院，其後繼起者雖不乏人，然以全國之統計，尚不敷遠甚，深望熱心同志，就各地多設肺病療養院，實爲撲滅結核之重要政策也。</p>
<p>（五）取締肺病僞藥貽害病家國人缺乏普通醫藥常識，已如前述。而一般不道德之藥商及僞藥，以是勃興，其藥雖不直接有害於病家，然以之貽誤治療時機，因是而喪失生命者，雖無明確統計，而以我國病者之衆多，及其常識之薄弱度之，則僞藥爲禍之劣，有不忍言者矣。故應由各地衛生當局，對於告種肺病藥物，詳加化騐，别其僞劣，明白宣布，則病家受惠，實匪淺鮮。此在各國早已行之，願我國當局急起而直追之，幸甚。</p>

<h3>慢性淋病有怎樣的危險</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>世人雖大多知道慢性淋病的難治，但是没有知道慢性淋病有怎樣的危險，往往放任著不加醫治，如果知道了有下面的危險，吾想大家必定早去醫治了。</p>
<p>（一）急性再發世人以爲淋病的急性症候經過了，從此可以太平無事，就没有危險，這是一種很錯誤的觀念。原來不把淋病醫治斷根之後，就是你永遠不去尋花問柳，但是潛伏的淋菌，仍舊可以急性的發作起來，這就呌做再發。</p>
<p>（二）急性合併症的出現尿道裏有了潛伏的淋菌，不但損害尿道，還可以隨時作崇，侵犯鄰近和遠隔的臟器。譬如侵及到睪丸，發急性睪丸炎，轉移到關節和心臟，發生急性關節炎和心臟炎，都是有很大的痛苦和危險。</p>
<p>（三）狹窄的形成尿道受著淋菌的侵及，柔軟的粘膜，就結成了硬固的瘢痕，因瘢痕的收縮，引起尿道的獗窄，尿道狹窄的結果，使病人不能排尿，有因此引起尿中毒，膀胱破裂，腹膜炎等等的危險病症。</p>
<p>（四）有傳染於對手方的危險　　歡樂健康的家庭，因爲一方受著淋菌的侵及，已經受著很大的痛苦了，一方面又要傳染給一個無辜的愛妻，也使他受著很大的痛苦，歡樂健康的家庭，就此打破，充滿了愁雲慘淡的空氣，吾知道受過了這樣痛苦的人，方才明白吾的話呢。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（二十）枝氣管肺炎（BronchPneumonia）</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做枝氣管肺炎？</p>
<p>（答）是肺小葉受着病原菌的侵襲，向起炎症的病。</p>
<p>（問）這種炎症大都發生在肺臟的那一部分？</p>
<p>（答）肺臟的後下部最多。</p>
<p>（問）枝氣管的原因是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）原因很多。有的是續發於各種疾病的，像急性或慢性枝氣管炎，傷寒，麻疹，百日咳，流行性，感冒，猩紅熱後發生的枝氣管炎就是。有的因爲異物吸入而起。</p>
<p>（問）那一種年齡發生最多？</p>
<p>（答）小兒和老人最多。</p>
<p>（問）枝氣管炎初起時的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）先感惡寒，然後發熱；但熱型不一定，大多呈弛張性。</p>
<p>（問）後來怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）後來發生劇烈的咳嗽，排出多量的痰，疾液是枯液膿狀。（有含血液的，但不呈鐵銹色。）病人的呼吸急促，用鼻翼呼吸（俗稱扇鼻子）。</p>
<p>（問）打診的時候，病部有音調的變化嗎？</p>
<p>（答）打診時病部呈濁音。</p>
<p>（問）聽診上呈什麽變化？</p>
<p>（答）有微弱的呼吸音，捻髮音，特有的有響性水泡音，支氣管音等。</p>
<p>（問）若用Ｘ光綫把肺部攝影，見有什麽現象？</p>
<p>（答）見兩側有不規則的陰影，散居各處。</p>
<p>（問）枝氣管肺炎有時現特異的型態，是怎麽樣的？</p>
<p>（答）有三種特異型，一是嚥下肺炎，二是埀下鬱血性肺炎，三是綫狀肺炎。</p>
<p>（問）嚥下肺炎是怎樣起的？</p>
<p>（答）嚥下肺炎，是因爲異物吸入到氣管中而起，所及又稱爲吸引性肺炎。（像昏迷時或麻醉時麻痺者的吸入食物，初生兒的吸入并水和咯出返流入内而起）。</p>
<p>（問）下埀鬱血肺炎，是怎樣起的？病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）是原因爲衰老，麻痺，手術，後等。病人呼吸加速，普且呈紫紺症，在第一回的呼吸運動時，有捻髮性小水泡音。有不合併發熱的。</p>
<p>（問）線狀肺炎怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）因爲病肺内多數小病竈融合，非常廣大，沿着脊柱向上行，打診時有線狀地位的濁音，所以有這個名稱。</p>
<p>（問）枝氣管肺炎的預後怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）是關於年齡的。年齡愈幼，愈是兇險。又若發熱太高，呼吸增速，面色慘白，意識溷濁的，都不良。續發於百日咳的和麻疹的枝氣管肺炎，病者多致死亡。</p>
<p>（問）治療枝氣管肺炎的方法如何？</p>
<p>（答）因爲續發於他病，所以先要顧慮原發的疾病。最重要的是使用强心劑，尤其是樟腦製劑和洋地黄製劑，非常有效。使病人安臥床上，内服袪痰劑，注射奎寗劑。若呼吸困難的時候，行氱氣吸入法，胸部行芥泥纏絡法，濕罨布，消炎泥膏的温敷都可用。</p>
<h3>診餘閒談</h3>
<p>— 張森玉</p>
<p>上次曾與讀者談過點營養不良的應用的攝生法。和飲食的營養法。以改進營養。强健身體。雖然約略説明了。但是有了良好的食物。到身體裏面去。怎樣提煉出來。是不可不曉得的。這個就是身體裏面裝就的一部奥妙機器。負擔着這種的工作。吾們來稍爲談一談。</p>
<p>（一）這部機器就是所謂消化器。他的搆造分别叙在下面。</p>
<p>（一）口乃消化器的首端。由兩片表皮。肌肉。粘膜造成的嘴唇組合的。可以啓閉。又可以含着食物。兼着用裏面的動作能以吸進液質的食物。如乳汁。湯水等。内裏有一個空腔。名呌口腔。靠外面的牆壁是由兩頰做成的。亦有外皮。肌肉。粘膜三層。上顎的邊緣生着一排牙齒。各式的共有十六個。形似馬蹄鐵向内開口列着。齒齦肉上亦敷着粘膜，中間的上顎敷着有皺褶的粘膜，前面名呌硬上顎。後面名呌軟上顎。擴張到咽腔的前上部。埀下一條粘膜包着的肌肉。名呌上顎埀（俗名小舌）。下顎的邊緣亦生着一排倒裝的牙齒。各式的共有十六個。如上排的牙齒一樣列着。齒齦肉上敷着粘膜。中間是口腔底部。上面亦敷着粘膜。中央生一個粘膜包着肌肉的舌頭。舌根後面是一個空腔。名呌咽腔。除上下顎接連的肌肉和粘膜做成前面上下左右的壁外。上面埀下一個上顎埀。兩旁各嵌了一個扁桃形的物。名呌扁桃腺。中間是空的。上通鼻咽腔。兩旁各有一管。通進耳耳裏面，前面的舌根下面是喉結上面。是處有一勺形的軟骨蓋。名呌會壓。在吞嚥食物的時候。就將喉結蓋好。免得誤進裏面去。在喉結後下面通進食管裏面。腔的後面名呌後咽壁。有肌肉。外敷着粘膜。這腔的四週裏有許多的肌肉。與頸部的肌肉同時動作着，可以將食物可以將食物吞嚥下去。口腔的底部和下兩旁有許多大小的腺。分泌着口涎。滋潤着粘膜。滑潤着乾燥的食物。還有消化的酶素。邦助着消化。更可减少胃臟裏面的酸素作用。</p>
<p>（二）食管這是一條二十五分寸的肌肉長管。外面包着一層堅靱的外膜。裏面敷着一層粘膜。有粘液分泌而滑潤着。管由喉結的後壁起。至胃的上口即岔門爲止。經過左右兩肺的中間即縱膈膜。有一定的彎曲。穿過胸腹腔相隔的一塊肌肉膜即横膈膜至腹腔。再與胃接連。</p>
<p>（三）胃臟這臟是形似牛角的空囊。外面有堅靱的外膜。中間是二層肌肉横紋和縱紋兩種。裏面敷有一層粘膜。分泌粘膜。濕潤食物。還有胃脾分泌胃液。消化食物裏的蛋白質。使胃液不化的質料鬆解。岔門與食管相接的地位有括約肌。司啓閉。底部擴大斜着胸骨的左下面。漸次的收狹横在心窩部的裏面。再彎在腹部右上面的肝臟小葉下面。復有一囊出口即幽門。亦是由環形括約肌司啓閉。下接在十二指腸的上端。</p>
<p>（四）小腸腸管共約六公尺五十公寸長。上由胃的幽門接連地位起。下至結腸廻盲腸瓣止。外包一堅靱外皮。中間是平滑肌肉層。裏敷粘膜。分泌粘液而滑潤着。但有絨毛狀的突出物。以擴大腸的吸收面積。中間有一種腺的管口分佈。小腸多。大腸少。十二指腸裏面則還有二種管口。一是由膵腸通入的。一是由膽囊通入的。另有淋巴結節佈着粘膜的上面。小腸共分三個腸段。</p>
<p>第一腸段名呌十二指腸。管長約三十公寸直徑約四公寸或六公寸。彎曲形似馬蹄鐵。在右腹側小肝葉的下面上段接連胃的幽門。下行段圓轉彎向中央。下段則在胃臟後下面横行結腸後面彎向左上。連接空腸的上端。在右上側是肝臟。大小肝葉間的後下面附着一個膽囊。由肝臟裏面通出一管與膽囊通出一管會接一管。通到腸的粘膜裏面。管口能以啓閉。另外還有一膵臟。嵌在十二指腸的圓彎的裏面。亦有一管通進粘膜裏面。管口亦能啓閉。兩管通出消化液。消化食物的各種質料。</p>
<p>第二腸段名呌空腸。管長約三公尺七十二公寸。直徑約三公寸。上端與十二指腸下段口相接在腹部左上側。横行結腸的後面。折向右側。横盤在腹部裏的中央臍孔的平行線上。下端直徑約五公寸。接在廻腸的上端。</p>
<p>第三腸段名呌廻腸。管長約二公尺四十八公寸。接連空腸。縱横在腹部臍孔下部的裏面。廻轉盤着在膀胱的上面。女子則在子宮的上面。下端接在腹部右下面外側骨盆上面的盲腸内側名呌廻盲腸尖瓣。管徑狹小。</p>
<p>（五）大腸管長共約一公尺五十公寸。上端由廻盲腸瓣下起。至肛門爲止。亦由堅靱外皮包着。中間是平滑肌肉層。裏面敷有粘膜。有粘膜滑潤。儲積糞渣時間至長。計分五段。</p>
<p>第一腸段名呌盲腸。形似圓椎狀。尖部斜行向中央下後面。在腹部右下外側裏面。靠在骨盆的腸骨漿葉部的裏面溝紋上。這段腸管極短。上端至廻盲腸瓣上接在結腸上行段的首端。下端則埀一細長的管。管徑細狹。口有一瓣與盲腸隔絶。</p>
<p>第二腸段名呌蟲樣埀。這管的長短粗細不一。長約六公寸或八公寸。甚至達二十公寸。上端接在盲腸尖端。下端則埀在腹部裏面。但多彎上。管口與盲腸通。下口則盲塞。這埀與消化上是没有什麽關係的。而且可以危害人的生命。就是所謂盲腸炎。這病是發在這埀裏面。並不是在盲腸裏面。</p>
<p>第三腸段名呌結腸。管長約一公尺餘。外面似劃有方格的溝紋。裏面有瓢形空洞的結。節節貫連。亦是由堅靱的外膜。中層平滑的肌肉。由層的粘膜組成的。有粘液在裏面滋潤着。在粘膜上有淋巴小結節。依照所行的方向分作三段。</p>
<p>（子）上行段由腹部右外側盲腸相接的地位倒行向上。前面靠着前腹壁的後面。外側靠右腹外側。内側靠着小腸。後面則靠在腰部方形肌肉的前面。至右腰（腎臟）的下端折折轉向中央接在横行段上。</p>
<p>（丑）横行段由上行段彎轉向前。經過大肝葉的下面稍向下凹進。由右横行至左經過胃臟下面。彎進胸廓左下面的肋骨裏面。再轉至後面腰部肌肉前靠在左腰外側和下行段連接。</p>
<p>（寅）下行段由左腰的外側重複彎向左腰的下面。靠着腹部左外側下行。至骨益盆裏面向前折右接在乙形結腸的上端。</p>
<p>第四腸段名呌乙形結腸。管形似乙字。由下行段結腸接的地位向後懸下至小骨盆裏面。再彎轉直向上行。至身體中央截面彎轉接在直腸上。這段結腸的組織與結腸是同的。但是没有狠現的結，</p>
<p>第五腸段名呌直腸。管長約十八至二十五公寸。直徑約半至一公寸。末段則較擴大。名呌壺腹部。腸管的組織與結腸是相同的。至下段較平滑。在第三鈎骨的地位和乙形結腸的弓形端接連。稍斜向前下行。至肛門的裏面爲止。</p>
<p>（六）肛門乃消化器的末端口部。在粘膜上有靜脈管的結和束。肌肉層有一内括約肌一外括約肌。組成内外狹窄處。如門有雙層然。以司啓閉。收緊的時候有褶皺紋。</p>
<p>人的體内。無處没有血管。神經。淋巴管。淋巴腺。等故消化器内亦都具有。而腹部裏面的前面和靠着腸管等上面還有腹膜。做成一囊。裏面有些許的粘液滑潤着。藉以便利動作。由腹腔後壁的前面佈着腸間膜。包着腸管。中間穿過所行到裏面去的血管和神經。更有靱帶鈎着各部。在胃。肝。腸。等前面並且鋪着厚層的網脂。保護着。大腹的人更加厚得多。消化器的自身的營養是由紅的動脈管供給。廢料是由紫色的廻血管。（名呌靜脈管）輸送至適當的地方。再排出體外。神經操管道的動作。附有肌肉層内。分泌的作用則在腺内或悉口或粘液上。淋巴液在淋巴腺或管内。亦營輸送養料。或防豫毒質的侵害。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談批評</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>批評家，是不易爲的。</p>
<p>肚裏想駡人，嘴裏郤還要帶一些好意，因爲不這樣，那就是摧殘文化，而摧殘文化的批評郤是要不得的。據説過去的錯誤就在這裏。</p>
<p>錯誤眞是有的。駡人雖不見得高明，而要求爽爽快快，捉住破綻而痛駡之，倒也並不多見。過去的錯誤，是在於拿着尖刀，雖想刺人，而終於刺不到要害。於是刃尖亂按。連原文的意思還没有看清，居然也背着（正人君子）們所僅有的公理和正義，吹着喇叭來嘰人了。　　這自然要算是批評的。</p>
<p>至於造謡中傷，挑撥陷害，雖不在批評範圍之内，但也還有人以此爲唯一的武器，插入批評名文中，以遂其幸災的私心的。</p>
<p>而這也不失其爲批評。</p>
<p>於是（作家之羣）就提異議了。他們認爲批評是不宜於指摘短處的，所以雖是行文上的破綻，也不該加以糾正，痛駡則更在嚴禁之列。於是文壇上一片稱贊聲，喜氣洋溢。</p>
<p>據説要這樣的批評才稱得起健全，足以帮助文化的發展。</p>
<p>但我怕倒也未必。因爲這種喜氣，在從前確曾洋溢過的。一個文藝團體裏總有一套人材，詩人，小説家，批評家；相約登臺，自敲鑼鼓自唱戲，自捧塲頭自喝采，未始不是一片稱贊聲。但説這對於文化的發展有甚麽帮助，到底不容易相信。</p>
<p>而現在是要重來這一套了。</p>
<p>并且在將來是還要發展的。盛世必用文治，（古有明訓）；一經批評，便成妙文，倒也（昔有先例）的。</p>
<p>（韓非子外儲説）郢人有遺燕相國書者，夜書，火不明，因謂持燭者曰：（舉燭！）而誤書舉燭。舉燭非書意也。燕相國受書而説之，曰：（舉燭者，尚明也。尚明也者。舉賢而任之。）燕相白王，王大悦。</p>
<p>這果然能使文化發展，而至於喜氣洋溢的。這種過敏的批評家，往往應運而生，時至今日，大槪又當下凡了。</p>
<h3>春耕</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>到春天，該是種地的時候了。</p>
<p>屯子裏，人一羣一羣的在田裏散着糞，犂地，下着種子，和往年一樣忙忙碌碌的。</p>
<p>莊稼人，一到春天，就要把身子交給田裏的。</p>
<p>可是，怪得很，王老頭兒却跟别人兩樣，他不到田裏去作活，呆坐在家中思量，——他决不定今年的莊稼應該怎樣種。</p>
<p>事實明顯地擺在那兒：前年收成好，糧實没有賣上大價錢，去年收成不好，租子交不齊，一年到頭把全身力量都消放的田地裏，除了黑夜；白天少有一刻的休息，只不過得到個食不獲飽的結果，再這麽繼續一二年，怕不要餓死了呢！</p>
<p>（明年再交不齊租，就别想種我的地！）</p>
<p>想到去年年底和地東要求欠租，地東聲色俱厲説的話，他就加倍地担心今年年底的悲劇，今年眞要再交不齊租，可就離滾蛋的日子不遠了。</p>
<p>那就只有工上加緊，料上加料來培植今年的地，或許還是個最後的補救辦法</p>
<p>但是這補救的辦法又眞能作到麽？家裏只有一個兒子，工還能緊到什麽樣！再説，那年不是工上加緊，那年不是盡力地往地上上肥料！只怨缺錢，僱不上人，買不到料，就影響到收成。不，又想回來：收成好賣不上錢還不是一個樣！他覺得如今該是莊稼人倒霉的年頭，一年變出來一個花樣，把莊稼人變的一年比一年窮困。　　（爹，南地今年種什麽呀？）</p>
<p>恰當這時，兒子從外面走進屋子，同</p>
<p>根本没有把下種那一回事放在心上，自然是答不出的，就只能隨意地應付了一句：</p>
<p>（等晚上想想再説罷。）</p>
<p>想不到他心意不定的情形，讓兒子看破了，就又問：</p>
<p>（爹，看你那樣子，像没精少神似的跟往年春天不一樣呢。）</p>
<p>問這話，當眞吏他難過起來。他那麽想起了：不是年代迭變，他們爺兒兩個種六七年地，憑怎壞也能討到一個媳婦，那能教二十五六的小夥子，還要光棍！</p>
<p>他不回答兒子的話，只顧想，又想：種地——賣氣力——多收賣不出錢——少收交不租－莊稼人要等着餓死罷。</p>
<p>可是，在這茫無頭緒的亂想中，讓他一下子想起張老頭兒去年的事情。去年，屯子裏租種地户多多少少都欠些租，交不齊，只有他張老頭兒却發了財。他發財，是怎麽一回事？爲什麽？是他種地多加了工，還是多上了肥料？不是，全不是，只是那麽一回事救了他！</p>
<p>那事情，是種大烟！從前種大烟是犯法的，但聽説改了（滿洲國）之後，就不算違禁了，起了照隨便你怎樣種都行。</p>
<p>一下子，悶在心裏無法解决的難題，就像得到了好的辦法似的，使他在心裏面那樣説：</p>
<p>（也來幹他一回罷）。</p>
<p>不是心理説話，簡直是變成了决定，他認爲只有那麽幹一下子，才能解决今後的困難！這，不但一年的勞力不至枉費，倒還可以發個小財呢。。因此，他笑着回答了兒子的問話：</p>
<p>（南地今年種大烟！）</p>
<p>那麽用足了氣力地説完，隨即站起身，在屋門後摸出他的棍子，出了家門，一直往張老頭兒家裏走去了。　　走在路上，有些人向他打招呼，他没有看見也没有聽見，他的全副精神只注在（種大烟）的事情上。</p>
<h3>關於（現實的認識）與（藝術的表現）</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>－答徐懋庸先生</p>
<p>我想這無需聲明，我的那篇短文（現實的認識），並非完全爲着（反對）徐懋庸先生的意見而寫的。但因爲記得徐先生曾經説過那樣的話，也就順便地提了提，因此引起徐先生更明確地表示了他的意見，而且還提出可討論的問題，這在我是非常高興的事。不過我們的意見却還是在根本上有着衝突的，例如，徐先生説：（我相信對於一個作家，現實在正確的認識是比藝術的正確的表現更其重要）。而在我，現實的正確的認識和藝術的正確的表現，並没有輕重的人发别，因爲在藝術裏，如果没有藝術的正確的表現也就不會有現實的正確的認識了；藝術，作爲一個整體的東西，它是不允許人來部份地講話的，爲了觀念的明晰，我們雖然可以説，藝術的搆成是經過像現實的認識和藝術的表現這樣的步驟，而從一種完成的藝術品裏若想抽出那是屬於現實認識的部份的，那是屬於藝術表現的部份的，將是不可能的事，這正如一種色彩，雖是經兩種顔料混合成的，而旣經配合之後，還想指示出那是某種顔料的部份，同樣是不可能的，但我們却可以説有着怎樣混合的顔料的比例的成份是能夠産生出怎樣不同的色彩。所以徐先生的那譬喻－（有正確的認識而無正確的表現，其毁壞也猶刻鵠不成而類鶩，認識不正確而藝術製作力大高妙，其失敗也，則如畫虎不成而類狗矣）。——是不適當的。他這意思好像是説，决定藝術的是先有着一種與藝術毫無關係的東西存在着了，他忘却這現實是表示在藝術裏的現實的這道理。也許我們對於（藝術的表現）的這名詞的看法，還根本是不同的吧。徐先生所以把（藝術的表現），在藝術中看爲次要的地位，我想，他是把這名詞的意義解釋成藝術製作中的最後的手法了，而我是把它看成除去思想的骨幹之外的一切的構想，佈景，事件的選擇，人物的性格舉動或穿插以及思想的具體的表現等等都在内的。所以我之謂現實的認識只是理性上的客觀的認識，雖然偶爾亦有從具體的現實的事件中獲得到認識的部份的，但無論如何這不能絲毫不加變形就可以願封不動地移到藝術上來。如果有人不承認藝術上的現實的變形的法則，那麽徐先生所謂（現實的正確的認識比藝術的正確的表現更其重要）的話，的確是無可爭之餘地了。論到這一點，我雖然不敢妄自尊大也像徐先生自己那樣説他（所把持的是一點平常的道理），但他對於藝術的法則有所疎忽恐怕也是不可諱言的事吧。　　根據以上所設的前提，我們再來觀察沙寗和巴札洛夫的例；據徐先生的意見，沙寗因爲是社會的地不存在的，所以阿志巴綏夫不能把它寫成眞實的，而巴札洛夫因爲在現實中已經有了他的（雛形），所以屠格湼夫能夠把他製作成歷史上的典型人物。像這樣對於藝術作品的人物的觀察法，正如從前讀（紅樓夢）看見黛玉一死寳玉出家於是便恨定了寳釵和鳳姐的心理是一樣地，已經完全受了作者的欺騙，失掉了客觀的鑑别的能力了。讀了（沙寗），於是便在歷史的書頁上翻尋有無那樣的——一個知識階級幾年不讀一頁書，在自己的叔叔失戀的當中講了一大套對於性慾的超人的理論而馬上就來熱烈地擁抱了她接吻，從情人的軍官的手裏奪過馬鞭打到他羞愧自殺，坐在火車上因爲厭惡人類的面孔就跳下車來喘一口大氣的——沙寗，這未免有點滑稽吧？若以這同樣的看法，（父與子）的巴札洛夫也不能説是（社會的存在的）了，恐怕就連那被稱爲人類之兩種代表的典型的人物堂，吉訶德和漢烈特也將成了藝術家的幻想的果實了吧。所以問題不在沙寗和巴扎洛夫是否曾經社會的地存在過，而在，那表現在藝術作品中的沙寗和巴扎洛夫是否有社會的地存在的可能，不是因爲沙寗是社會的地不存在而稱之爲幻想的人物的，也不是因爲巴扎洛夫是社會的地存在的而稱之爲典型人物的。不以藝術人物的變形或象徴性法則，而就以社會的地存在與否爲論斷，那是錯誤的。因爲像沙寗的個體也吧，像巴扎洛夫的個體也吧，以及一切藝術作品的人物的個體也吧，你都不會看到社會的地存在的實例。我再返覆地説，藝術不是這樣機械性的東西。（未完）</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（五五）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>眞的她以後時常有這樣的發作，差不多每天都有，並且每次像是由於筆爾的一句話挑發起來的，彷彿他懂着她那奇怪的莫明其妙的毛病的秘密一樣。他窺伺着她臉上那種間歇的休息的痕跡，於是以一些劊子手的狡計，以一個字把她那暫時寗靜的痛苦喚醒起來。</p>
<p>而他也和她一樣痛苦着！他因爲自己不再疼愛她，不再尊敬她，却要磨難她，而感着異常痛苦。每次當他把自己在這婦人和母親的心上割開的那血淋淋的傷口儘量地挑弄了一番後之，當他覺得她是非常慘苦而又絶望之後，他便一個人出去滿街徬徨，他受着懊悔之情的痛責，受着惻忍之心的重擊，他惱怒自己不該以他那親子的輕衊把她蹂躪到那樣地步，他簡直想要跳進海裡，想淹死自己來完結這事。</p>
<p>啊！他道時是怎樣願意饒恕她啊！可是他一點也不能夠，因爲他没有辦法忘記。假如他能夠不再使她痛苦也就好了；可是他這事也不能够，因爲他自己也始終痛苦着。他回去吃飯的時候，充滿了動人的决心，隨後，一見到她，一見到她的眼睛，從前那樣正直，純潔，而現在變得畏懼，狂亂，不敢見人的眼睛，他便不由自主地給以打擊，他不能忍住那來到嘴唇上的和他自己的决心相違的話語。</p>
<p>祇有他們兩個人知道的那不名譽的秘密，澈勵他和她作對。這簡直是他現在循流在脈管裡的一種毒液，這毒液使得他想要像瘋狗一樣咬嚙。</p>
<p>現在再没有什麽可以妨止他把她不斷地撕裂，因爲哲安現在差不多完全住在他的新房子去了，他不過每晚回到他的家庭裡來晚餐並睡覺罷了。</p>
<p>他常常看見他哥哥有些苛酷和激烈的地方，他以爲這是出於嫉妬的緣故。他自許要使他安分起來，並且總有一天要給他一頓教訓，因爲這樣接二連三的閙着，一家人的日子都過不下去了。可是因爲他現在旣然另外生活着，他對於這類粗暴的舉動没有以前那樣感覺痛苦；而他的喜歡安靜的心恩又使他趨於忍耐。並且財富把他迷醉了，他的思想祇落在那些對他有着直接利益的事物上面。他腦子裏充滿着一些新的細微的掛慮，竟至專門注意着一件短衣的裁製，一頂呢帽的式樣，名片的大小等。他滔滔不絶地説的他新店裡那些瑣屑的事情，他談着裝在他房内擘櫃裡的一些放襯衣的木板，擺在過道裡的衣架，爲着防備别人偷着進來而裝設的電鈴等等。</p>

<h3>瀉專刊每逢星期一日出版第五十二期　財政的現狀及其前途維祺</h3>
<p>近年以來，各國國内政治之變化，消長，幾乎全以財政問題爲重心。而財政和國民經濟各方面，如生産，消費，金融及物價等，又有不可分離的密切關係。所以財政之收支平衡，和與國民經濟之互相調和，不僅可以安定政治，同時實可以直接促進國民經濟之發展，間接招致社會之繁榮。反之，則必然惹起政治之不安，以至於全社會之總崩潰。故各國的爲政者，尤其是在現時世界經濟恐慌日益深刻化的過程中，莫不竭其全力以應付財政問題。　　反觀我國，從民國創立以來，始則恃外債以圖存，繼則藉内債爲挹注；對於財政政策的釐訂，國家預算的確立，以及學理上任何主義的採取，都未曾顧及；卽自國民政府定都南京統一全國後的財政設施，除創設許多新税！如麥粉税，糖税，火柴税，煤油税，等等外，依然取給於公債庫券，計自民國十六年以來，國民政府所發行的各種内國公債，其總數已超過十一萬萬元以上，而所謂建設的棉麥借欵尚不包含在内。借債在國庫每年的總支出中所占的百分比，據財政部的報告如下：</p>
<p>會計年度（每年截至六月三十日止）　　支　出　總　數　　　　　舉　　借　　總　　額　　　　百分比十七年度　（十七年七月起十八年六月止）　四三四、○○○○、○○　　八○、○○○、○○○　一八·四十八年度　（十八年七月起十九年六月止）　五三九、○○○、○○○　一○一、○○○、○○○　一八·七十九年度　（十九年七月起二十年六月止）　七一四、○○○、○○○　二一七、○○○、○○○　三○·四二十年度　（二十年七月起十一年六月止）　六八三、○○○、○○○　一三○、○○○、○○○　一九·四　　從此便可以看見借債在政府的財政歲出上所占的重要地位了。然而每發行一次公債，則政府必增加一部分還本付息的担負，因而增加一部分歲出；政府每增加一部分歲出，則又必須再發行一次公債；輾轉相循，勢必盡以國庫的收入充當公債的基金而後止。公債發行數額愈大，則市場遊資被公債吸收也愈大，於是結果必然影響到生産事業範圍的縮小，和國民經濟的衰落。茲先將年來國民政府所發行的内國公債及庫劵列表於下，然後再作理論的檢討。</p>

<h3>整理江蘇財政之管見胡健春</h3>
<p>竊維蘇省爲東南富庶之區，近年以來，財政亦不免困難，百務因之停滯，長此以往，誠屬可憂。夫蘇省財政之困難，其故有二：一由職司之混合，司政務者兼筦財務，責任不專，勢難兼顧；一由無經濟之中樞，入欵不能集中，支出又難確定，徴收機關旣不能統一，徴收方法復未盡善；加以官民之間，素鮮溝通，有互相猜疑觀望之習性，無通力合作之精神，此皆困難之主因也。是故欲謀省政之推行，財政改革，最爲切要之圖。惟根本改革，一時難期實現，急則治標，庶可易於從事。姑就現狀酌加整理，不必過事更張，以免治絲益棼。治標之計，重要之點，（一）（分清職責）政務財務各專其職。（二）（統一徴收機關）以縣爲單位，舉凡一縣應徴之税，統由此機關徴收，而徴收方法，必須簡單。（三）（遍設金庫）每縣皆設一分金庫徴收機關，不收現金，由金庫據徴收機關税單，負收税之責，而支領欵項，亦由金庫任支應之勞。如能實行，流弊固可减除，金融亦有把握，省縣預算翔實編造，主政者統籌全局，緩急攸分，酌盈劑虚，均可調節，財政之秩序，能有條不紊，政務亦易於澈底澄清矣。管窺之見，理想之談，或有一二可採者，我蘇省人士及省政當局，不妨聊作研究之資。爰陳方案説明於後：</p>
<p>（一）統一省金庫，並設立各縣分金庫，集中收入，以裕財力。</p>
<p>（説明）蘇省近年庫空如洗，馴至借墊無從，政費减折發放，尚不能按月支付。然細考全省及各縣正税及附加税，並其他各項收入，預計總額年達五千萬元以上，扣除水旱偏災及短繳者外，平均收人以七折計算，亦應有三千五六百萬元，而省縣各項收入，每月通扯，亦有三百萬元。雖支額亦巨，然有如此多數之收入，酌盈劑虚，似尚可資周轉。其所以困難者，卽省縣金庫之未能確定，而短乏經濟之中樞也。各縣徴存之欵，存置者有之，存放於銀行錢莊或他處者有之，移挪者亦有之，而以徴得之欵散置於各縣，不能集中於省庫，轉令主財政者庚癸頻呼，一籌莫展，豈計之得耶？欲謀改革，以圖補救，似宜以江蘇省銀行爲省金庫，於各縣遍設支行，兼理各縣金庫，分司省縣收支之任。則全省收入集中，百脈貫通，財力自裕，縱有不足，盈虚先後之間，不難調劑，而支付統一政務，與財務權限亦清。茲將辦法分列於后：</p>
<p>（甲）以江蘇銀行爲省金庫，遷總行於省會，總司全省金融之出納。他如農民銀行等可併入該行，專設農民部。凡關農民銀行之收放等業務，仍舊另帳計算，不相混合，如不能强合爲一，卽不必合併，審酌行之。</p>
<p>（乙）全省各縣，酌量事務繁簡，設立江蘇銀行支行或辦事處，兼司省分金庫及縣金庫事宜。</p>
<p>（丙）全省各縣之省縣正雜等税及附加捐税，統由江蘇銀行省分金庫及縣金庫司收入之責。按其性質，分别省縣及欵目，各立專户，收存保管及支付，不得另存他處。</p>
<p>（二）恢復各縣財政局，撤銷各項徴收機關，統一徴收，以專職責。</p>
<p>（説明）省縣收入，以漕糧正專附及地税爲大宗。縣長爲親民之官，庶政萃於一身，而財務復居其一大部份，一人精力有限，耳目難周，欲求毫無弊寳，恐百不得一。其他如營業税局·沙田官産局·省教欵産管理處之宰宰税所以及其他各項税收，複雜紛歧，徴收至不一律。似宜恢復各縣財政局，不論繁簡，槪行設立，所有上述各項徴收機關，一律裁併，以資統一。舉凡一縣之徴收事宜，統由財政局辦理，設正副局長各一人，局長由縣長兼任，副局長由財廳呈薦。財務獨立，職有專司。其局長必須由縣長兼任者，監督及催徴兩便，收效較宏也。爰將辦法分述於后。</p>
<p>（甲）全省各縣，不論繁簡，槪須設立財政局。</p>
<p>（乙）舉凡全省各縣之省縣正專附漕糧地税契税營業税，及屬於省教管理處之牙税屠宰税，並沙田官産收入，以及其他一切雜税，均歸財政局分科徴收辦理。</p>
<p>（丙）財政局長一，副局長一，局長主規畫全縣各項事業財務及負監督催徴之責；副局長專任本局行政上事務管理及行使稽核徴收整頓職權。局長由各該縣縣長兼任，副局長由財政廳呈薦，均由省府委任之。</p>
<p>（丁）除不屬於一縣或專案設立之徴收機關外，所有全省之營業税·屠宰税·沙田官産之各局所，以及其他之徴收機關，悉行裁併各該縣財政局，統一徴收。</p>
<p>（三）統一改善徴收制度，减輕人民擔負，而裕省縣金庫收入。</p>
<p>（説明）財務機關，百弊所集，雖有賢者，無法免除。綜計省縣漕糧正專附地税一項，平均年收三千餘萬元，官吏胥役之額外浮收者恐不止一成。卽以一成計，是全省納税人民於應納之税三千餘萬元外，復增三百餘萬元浮收之擔負。至於官吏胥役之虧挪侵蝕者，亦作一成計，是省縣所收之税，每年損失三百餘萬元。况各縣徴收費，係屬包辦性質，恐已多數成爲公開之私人利益，每年此項中飽，亦何止百萬元。兼之徴收機關復應支付，於是挪移騰墊，流弊繁滋，政府人民同受損失，所得利益者官吏胥役耳！似宜徴收機關不收現金，祇負批算税率塡發憑單之責，金庫收欵，必憑徴收機關之税單，方收税欵，而支付之責，亦改由金庫任之。徴收機關無應付之煩，移挪之弊，如此則司財務者不見現金，不勞支付，弊縱不能悉除，而亦廓清不少矣。辦法如后：</p>
<p>（甲）各縣处縣正專附之漕糧地税，仍暫各按該縣地方情形，分别酌予整理，暫勿大事更張。就各縣現經劃定之各區，按區應有糧户若干，徴額若干，由局於原有書差中，擇優委派，分任按區造册，送單，催徴事項，並由各區長及鄉鎭長恊助之，或仿武進無錫義圖辦法，各縣漕糧地税之單串，悉由財廳製發。</p>
<p>（乙）漕糟地税以外之各項税收，均暫仍照原有辦法，分别整理徴收。</p>
<p>（丙）各項捐税，各局應訉櫃徴收，並得酌設分櫃。</p>
<p>（丁）各局設徴收櫃之處，同時應由江蘇銀行於同一地點，設立省縣金庫收税處，派員收欵。</p>
<p>（戊）除漕糧地税，係由納税人持通知單赴金庫收税處線納外，其他各項捐税，於納税人赴櫃時，應由徴收員算塡應納數目之税單，交由納税人持單赴金庫收税處完納，納税人取得金庫收證，卽以收證抵作現金，繳櫃納税，由櫃於收得金庫收證後，給與納税人串票或印收。</p>
<p>（己）財政局各徴收櫃，一律不得收取現金，金庫收税處，亦非財政局之地税通知單，及其他税收之税單，不得收欵，以杜流弊。</p>
<p>（庚）財政局與金庫收税處，應每日將各項收數及總數互相比對無訛，於次日塡單，各自分别報告總金庫省政府財政廳省教欵管理處及該縣政府並欵産處，其報告單亦由財廳製發。</p>
<p>（辛）由省府財廳訂定各縣財政局局長副局是主管佐治人員徴收書差，以及應恊助徴收之區長鄉鎭長各項徴收考成比較之奬懲條例，以防懈惰，而資鼓勵。</p>
<p>（四）統一徴收費，以利收入而除中飽。</p>
<p>（説明）各縣財政局設立以來，尚有成績。乃因政費素縮問題，裁併縣府。今擬於全省各縣遍設，復須增設金庫，則政費勢必驟增支出。查省財務費支出者，有縣府二科·營業税局·沙田官産局·屠宰税局等經費，或提成以及各縣漕糧地税徴收費契税牙税等手續費，其數亦至可觀，若以財政局統一徴收，其他徴收機關，悉予裁併，則上項各費，以及漕糧地税之徴收費，並他項税收手續費，悉予仍照原支提出，由省廳統一支配，並酌提補助江蘇銀行遍設金庫之損伯。如此辦理，則省財務費，或不致加增擔負咸化私爲公矣，辦法列後：</p>
<p>（甲）各縣財政局經費，以各縣府第二科及各縣營業税局屠宰税局沙田官産局等原有之經費或提成作開支之費，及牙税契税等手續費充之。</p>
<p>（乙）各縣正專附漕糧地税之徴收費，仍照原有數目，或酌予整理，一律公開，提充各縣財政局徴收費。</p>
<p>（丙）上項各徴收費，一律分别徴存省縣各金庫，專欵存儲。</p>
<p>（了）各縣財政局所有徴存各項徴收費，及本局應支經費，並各項應支徴收費，各自編擬預算，呈由財廳彚核列入省縣預算，確定後，關於各縣徴收費之收支，均歸財廳統一支配。</p>
<p>（戊）江蘇銀行各縣設立分金庫及縣金庫，除所得徴存税欵之短期利息外，如應須由省庫補助者，得於上項徴收費内，酌提補助。</p>
<p>（五）確定省縣預算，務期收支適合，以重歲計而輕負擔。</p>
<p>（説明）江蘇銀行，旣爲省縣金庫，司省縣收支出納之重任·庫有存儲，方可支付，縱一時可資調劑周轉，亦必有確實之抵償，是省縣預算收支，固須適合，尤須有實在之收入。蓋蘇省頻年財政困難之影響，端誤於虚收實支也。是編製省縣預算時，經須省縣人士之審議，務於收支適合外，更須核實收入，方可得各縣人民之信任。辦法列后：</p>
<p>（甲）確定省經臨預算，除支出政費應加緊縮外，收入尤須切實，不敷之數，應以確實之收入抵補之。</p>
<p>（乙）由各縣應製各該縣預算，呈由省廳核定之，性質與甲項同。</p>
<p>（丙）省縣預算確定後，經常費每月應支若干，臨時費應須有欵，方可動支，不得與經常費牽混，以免紊亂。</p>
<p>（丁）縣預算由縣政府編製時，應聘請地方負重望人士，組織縣預算審議委員會審議决定後，由縣政府呈省彚核，省預算由省政府編製時，應聘本省紳耆負重望者及專家，組織省預算審議委員會，審議决定後，由省政府呈報中央。</p>
<p>（戊）無論省縣，非預算列入確之欵，不得動支。</p>
<p>（六）省縣預算經費，按月由省縣金庫定期就地支發，以利行政。</p>
<p>（説明）政務與財務混合，固爲政治障碍一大原因，因財務秩序之紊亂，而政務秩序亦因之紊亂者，實亦一無可如何之事。蘇省近年現狀，如官廳之政費，員役之薪工，教育之經費，軍警之餉糈，拖欠動輒數月，財廳發通知於領欵機關，而奉令支付之機關，恒無欵以廳，往往一月之費，須經數處支付，領欵者往返跋涉，或有或無，或分數次，數月而終未能清付，在領欵者形同索逋，固已疲於奔命，而支付者儼同避債，猶深感應付之勞。如徴收機關，旣不收取現金，則可免支應之煩，金庫負出納之任，則可免愆期之弊。省縣預算確定之費，似宜每月分類分别規定先後發放時期，按數按期，就各地金庫支給。省縣政教各費，皆可依時領用，財務秩序旣定，政務自可刷新，各縣金庫徴存各項之欵，均各組有保管委員會，須憑印鑑，會同支付，當不虞各縣地方人士之誤會矣。爰擬辦法於后：</p>
<p>（甲）省支出各項經費，按照預算，每月分别門類及先後支付日期確定後，按月依照規定日期若干日前，由財政廳預發支付命令於省金庫，並同時發給通知書於各該領欵機關，按期憑通知書就該所在地之江蘇銀行省分金庫支付，以免各領欵機關往返輾轉延期拖欠及零支等困難。</p>
<p>（乙）各縣之各項地方捐税專欵，各按門類，組織委員會保管之，庫有存儲，方能支付，除呈准省府財廳核准通知金庫者外，不得挪移借墊。</p>
<p>（丙）縣支出各項經費，同甲項辦法，確定後，每月憑縣長財政局副局長縣欵産管理處主任及該項保管委員會之代表委員之共同印鑑支付。</p>
<p>（丁）各縣之各項地方捐税專欵，如係長存或訂期，非按月支付者，銀行應給予月息。</p>
<p>（七）充實江蘇銀行實力，以鞏固省縣金庫而堅民信。</p>
<p>（説明）照上述各項辦法，則金庫爲全省金融之中樞，責任綦重，而司全省省縣金庫之江蘇銀行，實力充足，方足以固各縣地方人民之信仰，庶足負調劑盈虚之責任。似宜於監理委員會中聘任各行政區負有重望之人士參加，並增加其資本，擴充營業，辦理儲蓄，以厚實力，而堅民信。辦法列后：</p>
<p>（甲）江蘇銀行監理委員會之組織，以省府主席民財建教四廳長省教欵産管理處主任爲當然委員，另於十三區行政區中，每區推選或延聘負重望之紳耆一人爲委員，庶明瞭内容，以堅民信。</p>
<p>（乙）江蘇銀行應謀事業之發展，酌加資本，或添招商股，以厚實力，辦理儲蓄，以裕各内地人民經濟，發展匯兌及押匯之業務，以調劑商業，兼謀補救農村。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>從（大減價）中反映出來的</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>這十里洋塲，（東方巴黎）的上海所給我最深刻而發鬆的印象，應該推（大减價）爲首選。記得八年以前從四馬路經過的時候，就看見幾家呢絨綢緞店把大减價兩星期）的旗幟高張着，過了不如若干的（星期），那（大减價）的標語還没有取消。以後每隔一年半載，我偶然從那變家公司門前經過，發現（大减價兩星期）的期限，在旗面上正式被延長到一個月。此後裘葛屢易，那幾家减價市招也不斷在新陳代謝，但是（大减價）的期限，却竟是（悠悠曷極）！從這裏，我懂得了若干上海商人的（大减價）之（萬古常新）的門檻。</p>
<p>此外，我也曾（問津）過幾家（買一尺送一尺）的大綢緞店，不幸那價碼都是兩元以上，彷彿原來就用（二）字乘過一番的；還有四角五角一尺的（摩登縐），（時代綢）之類，那質料是硬而且薄，不但是人造絲，並有許多是出自（友邦）工人的製造。到了最近的一兩年，（大减價），（大拍賣）之風，更顯然普及到上海市塲的百行百業之中。從每一條熱閙或偏僻的馬路經過，我們隨時可以看到高貼在商店門内外之五色的削碼紙條，聽到（洋鼓洋號）在那裏吹奏最不悦耳的泗州調。這似熱閙而實凄慘的現象，已經是去（有價皆减），（無店不拍）的階段不遠。而且，（减）和（拍），似乎並不能使每一商店度過這（白虎）（太歲臨頭的年份。於是在各馬路上，我們又時常看見有些店面，在門縫中間貼着法院所贈之了又式的紙條。　　因爲（大减價）之風在上海是刮得天昏地暗，所以投機滑頭的（生意經）也就隨之而作多方面的表現。在半月以前，各報上常有一塊錢買三件羊毛衫，一塊錢買兩支自來水筆另送活動鉛筆一支，一塊錢買十二或二十個（來金戒指）的（强來兮）的廣告。然而對於這些（某洋行寫字間）的生意，購買者如果登門面試的話，他們的答復一定是（賣完了）。你最好是從外埠匯了錢來買（便宜貨），因爲那樣，就是你上了當的話，也不會同賣者發生（交涉）的。還有一塊錢買（四兩西洋參的（大贈送），我有朋友去試過，貨色和普通一塊錢一兩的（米參）差不多，但那（寫字間）所用的天秤是（特製）的，每一兩足有二錢五！</p>
<p>對於這些無奇不有，花樣百出的（大减價），我們可以從下列幾點加以説明：</p>
<p>第一，是中國社會大破産的反映：因爲百業凋敝和農村崩潰，把中下層社會的購買力削弱　極點。各種日常用品的市塲，都日益狹隘．各商店雖然在忍痛拍賣，而問津省畢竟是非常之少。商店老板們經常在恐慌之中，不得不用盡方法來吸收現金，以應付此期節關，年關各種（駱駝穿過針孔）的災難，於是（大放盤），（大减價）在上海以至全國各地，都由（偶然競爭）而成爲（經常拚命）；老板們固然是苦，但無數（過屠門而大嚼），手裏無錢的市民的尤其不堪想像。斯以，對於每一種（大减價），（削本傾銷一的標語，都應該視爲是病入膏肓的中國社會的瘡疤。</p>
<p>人　　的反映，　　　不景　）　　　席捲世界以來，任一帝國主義者都挾了傾銷政策到地大物博）中國來找一打拉），洋貨排山倒海，經常小斷的輸入，把民族工商擠到山窮水盡的絶地。普遍於上海市場的（大减價）的現象，一方面是表示帝國主義商品在中國的傾銷，一方面表示中國民族工業品爲了（相形見拙），在那裏削本。</p>
<p>第三，是中國商業道德破産的反映：中國商業旣然因外貨的壓迫和赴會的破産而大半瀕於（易簧），商業道德的墮落自然是不可避免。帝國主義商業固然是靠了捨得化本錢的廣告來（吹），然而却少有像中國滑頭生意那樣（吹）得看不見自己的影子的！（吹）得比實際相差太遠的結果，反而使一切廣告失去效用，更加速自己之營業的失敗。許多商店由常年（大减價）而繼續之以關門，即坐此弊。</p>
<p>（大减價）是中國工商業者找不到出路的哀鳴和掙扎，然而也只是哀鳴和掙扎而已！中國商人眞正的出路，不在如何傾銷，如何（減價），而在自己挺立於民族反帝運動的前線。除此以外，我只能看到他們（黑漆一團）的前途！</p>
<h3>到軍隊裏去</h3>
<p>— 少彭</p>
<p>那年我受了某種環境的壓迫，故鄉已非我安居樂業的所在，於是不得不跑上漂泊的征途，還然冀在落難的遭遇裏，開展一個稱心滿意的好局面。初度接觸社會的我，自然對於社會還抱着滿懷的熱望，一點兒也不曾體騐到社會是那麽冷酷的，人類只具一副狰獰的面相。在漢臯登了一個相當時期，備嘗了人世間的苦痛酸辛，現實地觀感到許多血腥一般的事實，青春的生命，負上了第一箭的創傷。在四頭謀生絶望與旅費告罄的極度窘態之下，爲了忍不住生活的鞭子的驅策，（到軍隊裏去，）便成了我當時謀找職業的唯一適當口號了。　　事情終於實現了。</p>
<p>經過友人Ｘ君的一度介紹以後，便在Ｘ連補了一名上士文書缺。脱下原來的學生服，換上一套四不相的灰軍裝，腰裏横着一根皮帶，莊根兒是十足的丘八模樣。可是上自連長下至弟兄們，都謚我曰（師爺），我初聽可眞呆住了，我如何可襲用這麽一個尊稱？這是皇帝時代才有的。後來看見其他的上士文書也被照樣喊着，便也習以爲常，不在意下。初出服務，什麽公事全都不懂，語言又不通，下尉特務長成了直接上司，凡事要　他的指揮督　，什麽花名册　，　斗開啦，……花樣邪氣多，一古腦上分派在你身上，成天也寫不完，記得工作緊張的時候，有過一連好幾晚不曾上床。餉呢，説來是二十元，挨上半年八月還不曾關過，每月僅能分得少許伙食尾。當弟兄們的可連這點也都難得，因爲上面規定發給的伙食，有時還不够吃啦。（中國軍隊裏普通規定每月伙食，官長十二元，士兵六元，而上士文書却在官長之列。）</p>
<p>那時，我們部隊正駐防湖北Ｘ縣，上帝可眞太提弄窮人了，一到中秋時分便特别感覺寒氣襲人。我又没有一條棉被，睡的一張硬梆梆的竹床，論其面積，寛不盈尺，長不及身，每夜刺蝟也似的縮成一團，鑽在薄紙厚的被單裏，咬緊牙關挨受着冷酷的秋風的襲擊。渾身的骨骼筋肉，被竹床絞得酸痛難忍。旣無法輾轉反側，只讓兩眼巴巴望到天明，我失眠的起源，大槪便於此時種下了很深的根苗。</p>
<p>其時我自己精神上所泛起的反感，意志上所遭受的打擊，不消説大無倫比，這種非人的陣營生活，比較往昔學生時代的安閒舒適，可眞有些異樣了。然而流光如閃電般向前行駛，匆匆地在風雪雨露的交相煎熬中，挨過了秋冬那兩個季候，接着不久軍閥ＸＸ史的大戰－討伐ＸＸ，適於此時爆發了。雙方動員了數十萬大軍，戰線延展數千里，大家　　　　　　大厮　　　　　我不能也成了這戰爭集團組成中被動的一員了。</p>

<h3>一羣檢煤渣的人們</h3>
<p>— 金笳</p>
<p>加里　　　着煤渣的·車下，緊圍着一羣貧苦窮困的男女們。</p>
<p>每一剷的煤渣從車上剷下來的時候，情形就非常的緊張。尖鋭的眼睛，敏捷的雙手，把那一塊一塊的煤渣，檢到自己的破籃裏，好似富人們對着金錢一樣的貴重。</p>
<p>（你幹嗎？來擠我）是秃着腦袋，穿着一條短褲褂的小三子説。</p>
<p>（誰擠你？小鬼子）。答話的是金家嫂。她戴了一頂舊了的男人的草帽，穿着一件灰褂子，一條前後共有四個補釘的褲子，左脚穿了一隻黑襪子，右脚穿了一隻破絲襪子。</p>
<p>（你才是小鬼子呢！媽的！你駡我）？</p>
<p>（好！你這小王八羔子）。</p>
<p>一堆煤查從車上剷下來，小三子和金家嫂祗顧去檢煤渣，所以這幕戲劇便没有繼續下去。</p>
<p>（你　開些了這是我的地盤）！對函又有人在　　了。</p>
<p>（你的地盤？寫着你的名字嗎？眞不要臉）！　　一堆煤又自車上剷下來，聲音就隨着煤渣低了下去。　　（媽的，你們又在擠我）！小三子又急了。</p>
<p>（願意擠）！金家嫂氣忿忿地向旁邊一擠，或者是太用力，不巧得很，那條補了四個補釘的褲子，又撕了一個大口子。</p>
<p>（哈！哈）！</p>
<p>（哈！哈）！</p>
<p>（什麽玩意！樂嗎）！金家嫂眞的羞得臉紅紅的。　　（哈！哈）！</p>
<p>（哈！哈）！</p>
<p>又是一堆煤渣，自車上産了下來。……</p>
<p>天漸漸的黑了，一羣檢煤渣的男女，還在那兒檢着。</p>

<h3>（我們的）作家</h3>
<p>— 木郎</p>
<p>我們的作家頽廢地躺在一張四條腿已經鬆弛了的椅子裏，這表示牠的主人在寫稿時身子摇動得怎樣厲害的結果。他的手裏夾着一支烟捲，無神的眼光落在面前攤着的幾張白紙上，怎麽也没有法子用筆尖和墨水把這些白紙劃出一點花樣來。我們的作家正一正身體，他重新思索一遍剛纔想過的東西；酒，大腿，擁抱，華爾滋，探戈，肉香，香顫，的胸部………歪曲，意識，線條！碼頭工人，烟囱，血汗，演出………巡禮，風景線，素描………他的腦子漸漸覺得昏脹了，他懷疑從上面這此斷片中，竟串不起，一個連貫的（烟士比里純）來。他咕嚕着：今天眞不行！</p>
<p>時間一刻一刻地溜去，蒼茫的暮色從小窗裏爬進來了，亭子間裏就顯得更黑暗。我們的作家似乎並没有覺得，他祇是加速度地旋轉他的思緒；烟的氣息佈滿了全室。突然有一陣熟悉的皮鞋脚聲從樓梯下面響了上來，接着推進門來的就是我們的作家的朋友Ｂ君。他可也是一位作家，並且也不是你們或他們的。</p>
<p>（哈！老英，你呆在這裏作甚麽？找材料嗎？我剛從ＸＸ看了跳舞出來呢。那最後一幕模特兒，的確夠味，嘻嘻………）</p>
<p>（誰像你這樣多閒多錢！人家答應ＸＸ寫的一篇稿子，到現在還没有着落呢）。我們的作家緊蹙着眉，眼睛看在地上。</p>
<p>（老兄，不要挖苦了，誰又閒多錢？我去看ＸＸ團的歌舞，還不是爲了要寫一篇批判嗎？你想，一篇評稿可換兩塊錢，除去門票一元，還餘一元；這還不是爲生計打算嗎）？</p>
<p>我們的作家凄然了，星子裏暫時靜默下來。最後他站起來。拍拍Ｂ君的肩膀説，</p>
<p>（我們總得有個地盤，老是靠這樣零碎地投些稿，不是個辦法。聽説Ｘ報要增設一種文藝副刊了，你和那裏的主筆是認識的，不妨跟他説説看，由我們兩人來編輯）。</p>
<p>（文藝副刊的編輯早就聘定了。况且Ｘ報的態度是很嚴肅的，也不會要像你這樣的盲目繙譯家兼影評家，至於我，那更不必説了）。</p>
<p>（我就不懂你説話總喜歡滅自己人的威風。當個把文藝副刊的編輯有什麽感覺困難的？照你説，你就願意一輩子過投稿的生活嗎？你倒説説看，到底自己有些什麽將來的設想）？</p>
<p>（我正在寫作一個長篇）。</p>
<p>（長篇）？我們的作家對於他的朋友的説話的冷然的態度感到驚異。</p>
<p>（是的），Ｂ君閉一閉眼睛，臉上呈着很得意的神情，（長篇，我預計寫四十萬字，這裏面統是我實生活的觀感，這裏有勞苦大衆的被壓迫的呌喊，社會的横斷面的忠實的暴露，狂飇發作的前夕的啓示………一個作家要成名，必須要有一部偉大的創作，他必須………）　　我們的作家的連連摇頭把他的朋友繼續興奮地説下去的勇氣喝退了。</p>
<p>（得了得了，你要吹牛不應在我面前，像你這樣一個十足都市化的淺薄少年，談得到什麽（實生活的觀感）？還有，還有，哈哈，（勞苦大衆）？你别痴心夢想地想做小説家了罷）！</p>
<p>（你怎麽老挖苦人？你自己………）Ｂ君急得有些説不出了。</p>
<p>（閒話少講，昨天你拿到的二十塊錢稿費，還没有請過客，隔壁新開的一家俄菜館烹調很好，今晚就是你做東罷）。</p>
<p>Ｂ君屈服地答應了。</p>
<p>我們的作家很高興，他除了有一頓白吃外，今天的困難也解决了，因爲他已經得着一篇稿子的材料。當他拖着Ｂ君踅進俄菜館時，他想，（題目就是（異國情調）罷）。</p>

<h3>都會的早晨</h3>
<p>— 吻心</p>
<p>東方的地平線上閃爍着紅寳石的光輝，一兩朶白雲在蔚藍的天空中游行，風過去像一隻冰凉的大手撫摩，馬路兩旁的樹深綠變成淺黄，馬路靜靜地躺在這明媚的秋光中，像也没有睡醒的樣子。</p>
<p>工廠的汽笛在大都會的四野拉着回聲，這一大團一大團黑色的牡丹，這有力的咆哮－工廠區域頓形熱閙，男女工人挾着飯包或提着飯籃，他們迎着朝曦，投入機械的鐵臂裏。</p>
<p>青年學生愉快地在馬路上跑着跳着，那富有彈性的腿，那流露着前進光輝的眼睛，他們錯落談笑的聲音在清新的空氣中跳盪，他們飽滿的面孔，像東方地平線上紅寳石一樣。</p>
<p>有時一輛兩輛汽車掣馳而過，大肚皮的男人和小巧的女人頽廢地落在車廂裏，那眼邊一道黑圈，那灰白的面皮，這腿兒和胳膊抬不起，紅綠燈光儘在腦袋中迴旋………</p>
<p>太陽伸出頭來看，笑了！</p>
<h3>看風轉舵</h3>
<p>— 爾礎</p>
<p>據有人説：世界是（舞台），咱們都是（舞台）上扮演的（戲子）。我深恐這還不十分切實，體貼，所以便擅專的把它改造一下説：世界是潦闊無際的（大海），社會是在（大海）裏飄盪的一只渺小的（船），咱們都是躱在船尾上，能指揮船身進或退的是把（舵）。但是這把（舵），倒是很（難駛）的；一個不得（勁），非但你自己本身有（性命）的憂慮，就是這整個船身也有（傾覆）的危險。徼倖。總算逃過了（全軍覆没）的關鍵，走入（歧途）。不幸的，就被（大海）裏的（風浪），一古腦兒捲光。但不管（全軍覆没）也好，走入（歧途）也好，（小痛苦）總是遲早要給你嘗一些兒滋味的。所以聰明的，就寗可去開了預定的（目的），（看風轉舵），雖然走入（歧途）也不妨。愚笨的，就固執着自己（目的），拚命和（風）死爭氣，倒底吃了（眼前虧）。不過究竟能不能達（目的），却又是一個問題了。　　咱們生在這樣樣要（時髦），事事要（摩登）的年頭兒，固執着自己（目的），和（風）拚老命的這類人，自然也應當（？）一槪列入，（不適者淘汰）之例；因爲雖然你的是大澈大悟者，其守也許祗是一個（大儍瓜），不免要給同類欺凌；所以也理當（？）（下野），讓（看風轉舵）的（適者），逐漸的滋長起來。如果你不甘（自弱），那就老實不客氣，一拳一脚的（眼前虧），祗得硬往肚裏咽。又如果你想（改頭換面）的在社會裏混過，那你非但先得學會一套（看風轉舵）的（把戲），并且還有扶植（看風轉舵）者的（義務），應該大捧其場子；（千萬不可大喝其倒采）然後你也有（被捧）的日子到來。所以，（拍馬）（吹牛）的（本領）固不可不有，然（看風轉舵）的（把戲），確也要學會，好免得吃（眼前虧），但是，以後却又不在此例。　　譬如某甲説：（今朝天冷來）。你應當很敏捷的回答：（是呀！今天比昨天冷多了）。最好會要裝出些抖擻的模樣，可以表示你的（忠實）。而甘乙説：（今朝天熱）。你也應當很敏捷的回答：（是呀！今天比昨天更熱了）。最好把你衣服都除得精光，表示（更熱）的態度。但丙又説：（我們搓麻雀吧）！你千萬不可正經的直説：（不來）或（我不會）。那他可惱恨了你。應當立刻抬桌，傾牌，裝出會的樣兒來，寗可把錢悔氣。其他，可以類推。不過同時要注意：在你没有得到（被捧）的地位時，切忌爲先發制人：應當隨在做一個很（忠實）的答者，附和者。　　總之，你這把（舵）要很靈活的看風而轉：風東即東，風西即西，（歧途）兩字，暫時可以抛開，反正，（眼前虧）可以不吃了。他來了，你應酬。他去了，你送門。一百萬個（附和），一百萬個（讚同）。不夠，還可以（加二），説得更熱烈些。那麽，保證你可以到處受人（歡迎），無處不受人（寵愛）；并且你一定也會眉飛色舞的對愁苦滿臉的老婆説：（幸運來了！壁也不碰了！釘也不撞了）！於是，老婆也笑了。</p>

<h3>業餘信箱　申報流通圖書館的新事業</h3>
<p>親愛的執事先生：</p>
<p>你們爲我們計劃的週到，盛情可感；我决於最短期内，再行加入。</p>
<p>誠然，我們的社會是需要，切望我們　向科學的路走去。然而牠－科學－簡直是使我茫茫然，像嚼臘般的無味；我知道，我切實的知道，我是太缺乏指導，太没有統系。我切望着你們的（讀書指導）給我以詳明的指示。</p>
<p>同時我將作更進的要求，就是你們最好能爲我們請幾位學術上的導師，爲我們於理解力有時不能解决時底質疑。不知能與不能？敬祝公安陳鴻莊上。</p>
<p>編者按：上面是本報流通圖書館新近從她一位已經退出了的老讀者那裏得到的覆信。原來該館最近因爲要預備舉行一週紀念，將她一年來的工作，加以嚴格的檢討，發現目下加入的讀者，雖則已達到三千七百餘人；但要是没有中途退出者的話，那麽讀者的總數，應當已經超出五千人，工作的效能，也至少可以加增三分之一。於是更進而研求此一千七八百人所以退出的理由，以爲計劃對策的根據。結果，確認他們的退出，無非爲了下面三大理由：（一）因事離滬。（二）感覺書籍太少。（三）暗中摸索，感不到興味。因此决定的對策，也就有下列的三項：（一）計議將服務範圍，推廣到外埠。（二）添購書籍。（三）添設（讀書指導）部。第一項推廣服務範圍一層，因茲事偉大，一時尚不能决定實行的日期。第二項則已在最近一個月内，添了三千餘册的新書——目下藏書總數，已有一萬一千餘册了。第三項（讀書指導）工作，現正編印各科自習指南，並且預備自明年一月起，在本報特闢專欄，備讀者的質疑。我們雖不敢以導師自居，但很願意彼此用切磋的態度，相互啓迪也。</p>

<h3>上海（十五）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（哥哥，姐姐來了。）</p>
<p>（誰？）</p>
<p>（舅舅，家的姐姐。）</p>
<p>兩個月來，忙於社中的事務，寫信給她之後，不復記憶着她了。今夜慧姊突如其來，我懷疑着站起身，敏姊坐在寫字臺的對側，偏着頭送過嘲笑的媚眼。没有充分的時間夠我躊躇，表姊已大踏步跳進來。穿着白由布的旗袍，白帆布跑鞋，被日光矄成微黑的臉兒，襯在短短的秀髮中間，和上次電車上相見時，絶然換了個人。敏姊忙迎到天井握着慧姊的手説：</p>
<p>（我們多少年不見面了。）</p>
<p>當然，慧姊不能認識小時候闊别的敏姊，怚忡着皺起了眉，對這親熱的同性不知如何應付。我忙説：</p>
<p>（慧姊，她是敏姊，我們小時候的朋友啊。）</p>
<p>（噢，敏姊，正是多年不見了。）</p>
<p>兩個笑着走進屋裏來，并坐到沙發上，叙起闊别的情形，我問了舅父好，見不能揷話，重埋頭燈下整理我的稿件。半響，慧姊像忽然見了弟弟問：</p>
<p>（馨弟，你幾時到上海的，怎不到我家來？）</p>
<p>（哥哥和敏姊先到上海，我後幾天來的。）馨弟依在敏姊身旁説。</p>
<p>（我們在火車上相遇，知道萍弟和繼母不睦，我説不能放馨弟一個人在鄉下，所以寫信去要他到上海來。）　　我聽了敏姊的解釋，方始抬起頭來，慧姊正面對着我，就好像對我説：</p>
<p>（應該帶馨弟一同出來，小小的年紀！）慧姊笑説着，却那樣的不自然。</p>
<p>敏姊一時接不上話來。我再不能加什麽解釋。</p>
<p>弟弟望了敏姊的臉，回過頭來望着我，恰巧小黄從屋外闖進來，弟弟跳出去説：</p>
<p>（黄先生，法國公國去的？）</p>
<p>（三角戀愛，你也説俏皮話。）</p>
<p>自從我叙述了（夢話）之後，小黄就以三角戀愛作爲我們三個的代名詞，在我社中的人也聽慣了，但今天的一聲的三角戀愛，在不妥恊的空氣中，更形進嚴重性。小黄走進屋裏，見坐着一位驀生的女客，一溜烟的上樓去了。</p>
<p>本來在没有話説的時候，現在更没有話説了。我低下頭去想避免敏姊慧姊的目光，慧姊立起身來説：</p>
<p>（我還要到朋友家去，敏姊，弟弟，有閒到我家來。）</p>
<p>我想説什麽話，慧姊已跨出天井。</p>
<p>我和敏姊對視着，恍惚被誰督責着有一定向她解釋的必要，急步追出門去。</p>
<p>（慧姊……）</p>
<p>一輛黄包車載着那顆短短秀髮的頭顱向北消逝。</p>
<p>廿六小姐病了</p>
<p>我像遺失了一件記不起來的東西，懷着沉重的心，拖着沉重的脚步，走進屋子裏，屋裏已没有一個人，我把稿件堆過一旁，燃着一枝烟，顧前思後想着幾分鐘前的情形。兩月前寫給慧姊的信，我僅説不能居住舅舅家的原因，與乎毅然脱離了家庭，想到上海來幹一點事，此外没有提及敏姊馨弟的話。今晚慧姊突然來訪，不言可喻是善意的，但是目前的情形，對於女性多疑善妬的天性是不可掩飾的事實，而敏姊的措辭，更顯出强有力的鐵證。我雖不愛慧姊，也不能使她爲我而苦痛；我幾乎想立刻到你家匯向她剖白一切。</p>
<p>我丢了烟尾，弟弟從樓上下來説：（敏姊哭着哩。）</p>
<p>我跑上三樓，她臥房已下了鍵，搥門呌着她，連房中的燈光都熄了。無奈走到自己臥房裏，小黄握住我的手説：（青萍原諒我！）她仄歉的注視着我，我反憫憐起他來。</p>
<p>（小黄，不干你的事。）</p>
<p>（總是我喜歡開玩笑的不是！）</p>

<h3>Huang Renhuan Meets Li Yangjing to Discuss Guangdong Border Defense; Group Army Holds Meeting of Senior Officers to Discuss Strategies for Responding to the Current Situation</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Renhuan went to Meixian on the 8th to meet Li Yangjing to discuss the defense of the Fujian border and to hand over command of the Second Column. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The First Group Army will hold a meeting of all senior military officers on the 15th to discuss and decide on strategies for responding to the current situation. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<h3>=Hu Hanmin to Issue a Statement=</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Hanmin's secretary, Wang Yangchong, said on the 10th that Hu absolutely did not secretly propose three conditions or five articles. Hu advocates that there should be absolutely no compatibility with Fujian. Going to Fujian is not what he wants. It is rumored that Hu will form a third government, which is completely unfounded. Hu will issue a declaration within days to express his attitude. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to a source, Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, and Chen Zhaoying, members of the Central Committee who are going south to discuss the current situation, are expected to arrive in Hong Kong at noon on the 11th. The Guangdong side, in order to discuss how to receive Zhang and Ma, has dispatched Chen Rong and Liu Luyin, two members of the Central Committee, to Hong Kong to meet Hu Hanmin and solicit opinions. It is said that Zhang, Ma, and others are making this statement in their personal capacity, which makes it easier to talk. They are committed to resolving the current crisis through political means. Therefore, the focus of the current situation has now shifted from Nanjing to Hong Kong and Guangdong. In general, after Zhang, Ma, and others meet with the southwestern side, if there is a tendency to converge, the Central Committee members from Hong Kong and Guangdong may submit a joint proposal at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee to turn the tide of the situation. However, the central government believes that the Fujian side has betrayed the party and the country and cannot be forgiven. Whether it can accept the proposals of the southwestern committee members will depend on whether the Fujian side can abolish the pseudo-organization. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Southwest Government Affairs Council held a meeting today and decided to send representatives to Hong Kong to welcome the four peace envoys, including Zhang Ji, who will arrive tomorrow.

<h3>Taking Over Shanhaiguan: Many Obstacles Remain; Bandits Rush Out Near Shimen, Occupying Villages and Pillaging Wantonly; Japan Unilaterally Incorporates Dongluo into Suizhong, Building Markets, Barracks, and Train Stations</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Island dispatch: Yesterday, dozens of bandits suddenly rushed out from outside Shanhaiguan near Shimenzhai, fully equipped with guns and horses, occupying villages and plundering wantonly. The situation is extremely rampant. Our security team sent a team to intercept and suppress them today. The bandits seem to have a background. The matter of taking over Shanhaiguan is still being negotiated with the Japanese side. Without our consent, Japan has unilaterally incorporated Dongluocheng into the jurisdiction of Suizhong County, actively building markets, barracks, and villages, and building a new train station four li away from the Shanhaiguan train station, which is expected to be completed between February and March next year. Currently, Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County, is negotiating with Ii, the head of the Japanese special service agency stationed in Shanhaiguan. Tao Shangming will also go to handle everything soon. If the Japanese side can make concessions, Shanhaiguan can be taken over; otherwise, negotiations will have to continue.

<p>(Beiping) Liu Xingpei, the magistrate of Funing County, came to Beiping on the evening of the 9th to seek medical treatment. According to Liu, Funing was in a terrible state after its recovery. After my supervision and rectification, it has gradually become effective. The remaining bandits fled to Yiyuan Pass and are unable to cause further disturbances. There are still Japanese troops stationed there and they must be withdrawn through negotiations. The Funing agricultural relief work has now been completed, and education has largely been restored. The county bank borrowed 300,000 yuan to be used as capital for loans to farmers. Since the execution of the traitor Zi Zujin, they have all fled and dare not hide in the county. I have five plans for the future governance of the county: (1) to investigate the household registration, (2) to reduce litigation and simplify penalties, (3) to clean up land taxes and reduce taxes to benefit the people, (4) to organize a people's militia and county-level security, and (5) to approach elders and diligently seek the people's needs.

<h3>The Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission Drafts a Solution to the Kham-Tibet Dispute; Tibetan Troops Concentrate on the Border Attempting to Invade the Interior; Qinghai-Southern Gansu Border Defense Commander Requests Instructions on How to Respond</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission has drafted a solution to the Kham-Tibet dispute and submitted it to Wang and Chiang for instructions. Once approved, both the Qinghai and Tibetan sides will be ordered to implement it. As for sending senior officials to mediate, it may be difficult to achieve this for the time being. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Qinghai-Southern Gansu Border Defense Commander telegraphed that the Tibetan side had recently set up checkpoints on the Qinghai-Tibet border, heavily taxing merchants. More recently, they have concentrated more than 10,000 Tibetan troops on the border, showing signs of invading the interior, and requested instructions on how to respond. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shi Qingyang said that he had inquired about the situation of the Kham-Tibet conflict by telegram, but had not yet received a reply. According to my speculation, the Tibetan troops may be attempting to retake old territories such as Dege, but it is unlikely that there has been any military conflict. As for the solution, the representatives of both sides in Kham and Tibet have been invited to discuss the matter this time. It has been agreed that the thousands of lamas from Da Jin Temple and Qingke Temple who are living in exile should be allowed to return to their original temples to preside over them, thereby reducing some of the disputes. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An agency has received information from Tibet that the Dalai Lama is indeed harboring ambitions and is currently deploying heavy troops on the front lines. There are currently 2,000 troops in Jiangka Gongjue, 1,500 troops in Jiangyuan and Lato, and about 1,000 troops in Changdu, and the number is still increasing. It is also learned that the Dalai Lama recently sent people to India to purchase 4,000 rifles and 1.7 million rounds of ammunition. It is said that the Tibetan side currently has more than 30,000 troops, not including local militias. It is now heard that the situation is indeed tense and that there is a plan to invade Qinghai, because there are indeed other foreign forces behind them. It is also learned that the negotiations between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama are also on the verge of collapse, and it is feared that the Panchen Lama will be unable to return. It is said that the Panchen Lama will come to Beijing at the end of the year. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>

<h3>Zhao Lei's Troops Disturb the Area Near Yutian, Obstructing Traffic Between Beiping and Yutian</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Lei and Liu Zuozhou's troops, formerly security teams reorganized in eastern Luan County, rioted in Luan County at the end of last month.

<p>(Hankou) All members of the Hubei Provincial Government, led by Zhang Qun, issued a circular on the 9th denouncing the rebellion, stating that Chen and Li established a new regime and changed the era name, betraying the party and the country.

They respectfully led 30 million people to request the Central Government to launch a punitive expedition as soon as possible to lay the foundation for the country and live up to the expectations of the people.

<h3>Five Southwestern Provinces Establish Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The five southwestern provinces are establishing civil aviation, with Liu Peiquan starting preparations to purchase aircraft. After Liu came to Beijing to meet with the Minister of Communications, he returned to Shanghai and then to Guangdong. On February 1st of next year, the Guangzhou-Longzhou line will be launched first. The general organization is as follows: the name is the Southwest Five Provinces Civil Aviation Company, divided into five lines: Guangfu, Guanglong, Guangqin, Wugui, and Nankun. In the first phase, the Guanglong, Guangfu, and Guangqin lines will be opened first. The Guanglong line runs from Guangzhou through Wuzhou, Guiping, and Nanning to Longzhou, connecting to the east with the Guangfu line, connecting to the Shanghai-Guangdong line of the China Aviation Company, and connecting to the west with the Hanoi-French Vietnam line, making it an important route for international connections between Europe and Asia, with a total length of 696 kilometers. The Guangfu line runs through Yanping, Tingzhou, Zhangzhou, and Meixian, connecting to the north with the Shanghai-Guangdong line of the China Aviation Company and to the south with the Guanglong and Guangqin lines. The Yanping and Tingzhou stations in the middle are planned to be reserved for the second phase due to the lack of airport facilities. The route is 780 kilometers long. The Guangqin line runs from Guangzhou through Jiangmen, Gaozhou, Haikou, and Beihai to Qinzhou, with a length of 1,364 kilometers, serving as the midpoint of the southern section of China's coastal routes, connecting to the coastal routes of Shanghai-Tianjin and Shanghai-Guangdong of the China Aviation Company, and connecting to the Guangfu and Guanglong lines. In the second phase, the Nankun and Wugui lines will be continued. The Nankun line runs from Nanning through Baise and Mengzi to Kunming, serving as the terminal point of the southwestern routes, connecting to the east with the Guanglong line, with a length of 716 kilometers.

<p>Shaanxi Levies Special Consumption Tax on Postal Packages</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications Requests the Ministry of Finance to Stop It</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shaanxi Finance Commissioner levies a special consumption tax on postal packages. The Ministry of Communications had previously ordered the Postal Administration to forward instructions to the Shaanxi Administration to negotiate with the Shaanxi tax authorities. The Commissioner argued that the collection of special commodity consumption tax outside the post office is different from the previous collection of postal package tax. However, postal delivery and transportation must now be treated equally, meaning that Shaanxi Province's finances are not well-off and cannot stop the collection. The Ministry of Communications believes that the financial difficulties of Shaanxi are indeed true. Looking at the whole country, almost all provinces are the same. However, there are legitimate ways to raise funds and manage finances. The special consumption tax on postal packages collected by the province is clearly inconsistent with the abolition of likin. Yesterday, a special request was made to the Ministry of Finance for investigation and prohibition to maintain postal services. (Dispatch of the 10th)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary: A Discussion on the Imposition of Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>Today, our nation's financial difficulties, whether at the central or local level, have reached an unmanageable state.  A fundamental reorganization awaits the stability of national politics. Currently, the imperative is to prioritize increasing revenue and reducing expenditure as fundamental principles.  A recent report stated that Finance Minister Kong ordered the ministry to draft an inheritance tax plan, which will be implemented upon approval by the central government.  This indicates that such a move is inevitable, differing only in timing.  We discuss this issue with the understanding that each new tax represents a burden on the people. Few would not consider opposing it. However, after weighing the pros and cons, it appears there are also reasons to support it. Inheritance tax has been in place in various European and American countries for a long time, with very high tax rates. It has been a major source of tax revenue for these countries, with roughly three distinct characteristics:</p>
<p>1.  Regarding the tax revenue itself, the actual existence of the object (the inheritance) allows for accurate assessment and collection, yielding substantial benefits.  Heirs often acquire this property without labor, which can be considered an unearned gain.  Their ability to pay taxes is easily assessed and fixed.  Furthermore, the different types of inheritance allow for flexible taxation, which can be raised at any time according to the development of the social economy.</p>
<p>2.  The nature of the tax is based on the thickness of accumulated wealth to establish the tax standard. It absolutely does not erode the actual profits. It is also not like business and consumption taxes, which can easily hinder the production and operation of the taxed party. Additionally, the rights of the heirs are legally protected through taxation, avoiding disputes and quarrels. Furthermore, those who accumulate wealth selfishly, living in luxury and planning for their descendants, being greedy and insatiable without knowing that excessive hoarding leads to ruin, may be restrained in their extravagance by taxes. They may learn to be content and not burden their descendants with wealth.  Descendants may also become more self-reliant and not depend on the legacy of their ancestors, striving for independence.  After the imposition of taxes, there will be a sense that the inheritance is limited, forcing them to work hard for survival. Those who were merely wasteful consumers in the past can easily transform into independent and productive individuals. This is also a beneficial method of taxation with educational value.</p>
<p>3.  Wealth is essentially the lifeblood of society. Those who are good at making profits absorb too much. Like all the blood concentrating in one place, it leads to local congestion, while other parts inevitably experience depletion and anemia. As the saying goes, "One is not concerned with scarcity, but with inequality; one is not concerned with poverty, but with unrest." When wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few rich people, there will inevitably be starving and restless people in the world. Humans are inherently greedy, and without discipline and laws to restrain them, they will inevitably fall into danger due to economic disparities. Therefore, the Han dynasty increased land taxes to burden wealthy merchants. At that time, it was said that the power of a family with a thousand pieces of gold was comparable to that of a local ruler, and those with millions enjoyed the same pleasures as kings. Hence, there were measures to equalize wealth, merely correcting excessive accumulation. Buddhists say that miserliness leads to the realm of hungry ghosts, meaning that hoarding wealth and causing poverty will be punished after death. Therefore, charity is the antidote to miserliness.  Inheritance tax is likely a good method for adjusting surpluses and deficiencies and dispersing stagnation.</p>
<p>Moreover, finance is the source of a nation's politics. A clear and bright political climate leads to a harmonious society.  There is a significant and close relationship in all aspects. The government is currently facing external troubles and internal worries, while the global economic panic deepens daily.  Avenues for increasing revenue have reached a point of desperation, like taking flesh to heal wounds.  Any attempt to increase other taxes directly impacts ordinary people, who can no longer bear the burden of increased taxation.  Therefore, the focus shifts to the vast inheritances that wealthy families hoard for generations, opening a new era of taxation. On the one hand, it has little impact on ordinary people. On the other hand, it provides a significant awakening for the wealthy, who sit idly and do not manage their livelihoods.  The reason we support this tax law lies in this, not solely as a means for the government to open up a source of income.</p>
<p>However, we still have hopes for the government authorities. First, this significant tax revenue must be used for undertakings that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihoods, genuinely benefiting the nation and not squandered on unnecessary expenses. Second, all regulations and procedures must be carefully and meticulously established to prevent those responsible for collection from engaging in corruption. Third, future tax officials must be selected for their integrity and public service, and those with cunning must not be allowed to join their ranks. Only then can we hope to achieve practical benefits. Otherwise, this type of tax is easily manipulated for personal gain and collusion in fraudulent practices.  Carelessness can easily lead to disputes and leave behind a cause of social unrest. This must be prevented.</p>
<h3>Case of Non-Recognition of the Puppet State: Correspondence with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>▲Geneva, November 8 Communication Regarding the announcements of steps to be taken on June 14, 1933 regarding the non-recognition of (Manchukuo), the following is a summary of the responses from various countries:</p>
<p>(1) The Secretary-General sent the following letter to the governments of the countries participating in the Advisory Committee: (Since the government of your country has representatives participating in the Advisory Committee that issued the announcement, unless your government denies it, the committee will assume that your government is taking the recommended steps).</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the representatives of various countries on the Advisory Committee at the time of issuance were as follows: Belgium, Britain, Canada, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Guatemala, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey). The participation of the U.S. government was based on the conditions outlined in the letter from the Secretary of State on March 11, 1933.</p>
<p>The British government's response to this letter on July 13 stated that the announcement seemed to be missing two conventions in item B, which mentions public conventions: (1) International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, signed in London on May 31, 1929; (2) Load Line Convention, signed in London on July 5, 1930. The Mexican government replied on July 19 that, based on its policy of dealing with the Sino-Japanese issue, it agreed to approve the recommended steps for non-recognition of (Manchukuo). U.S. Minister to Switzerland Hugh Wilson notified the Secretary-General that the U.S. government's attitude remained to adhere to the principle of non-recognition and that it agreed with the conclusions of the Advisory Committee, except for a few details, and that the procedures followed by the U.S. government, in fact, conformed to those recommended by the Advisory Committee, except for a few details.</p>
<p>(2) The letter to the member states that did not participate in the Advisory Committee was as follows: (Since the proposal (the Sino-Japanese dispute) has been incorporated into the report of the General Assembly, the Advisory Committee believes that your government will adopt the recommendations in the announcement. Please let us know your opinion as soon as possible.)</p>
<p>The governments of Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti, Colombia, Nicaragua, and other countries responded, either stating that they had noted the recommendation or were considering it. The Indian government notified the Secretary-General on October 19 that it would take the same attitude on this issue as the British government. The Siamese government notified the Secretary-General on September 27 that Siam had no relationship with Manchuria and therefore would not actively pay attention to this matter.</p>
<p>(3) Notification to non-member states: According to the decision of the Advisory Committee, the announcement it issued was sent to non-member states together with the General Assembly's report on the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>The Egyptian government replied on August 22 that it had noted the General Assembly report (February 24) and the Advisory Committee announcement, specifically expressing its agreement to adopt the same attitude and actions as the League of Nations members.</p>
<h3>How to Reorganize the League of Nations: Constructing a United Front, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Poland Support the French Declaration; Peng Gu Will Travel East for Political Liaison; Italy Advocates Another Grand Plan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, French Foreign Minister Peng Gu issued a declaration in Beijing regarding the League of Nations reform plan, clearly stating France's attitude on this matter. The Belgian political circles were greatly pleased upon hearing this. There are two layers of opinions here. First, according to the League of Nations Covenant, all member states have the right to propose amendments to certain articles of the Covenant, provided that the fundamental principles are not harmed. Second, the current plan advocated by a certain party to transform the League of Nations is not aimed at improving the League of Nations, but is used as a means to allow only a few major powers to preside over major issues such as the revision of peace treaties, without the participation of other countries. According to the current League of Nations Covenant, small countries also have the right to speak. Generally, it is said that the British government opposes reducing the rights of small countries in the League of Nations, which is also satisfactory to the people here. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<h3>What is Wrong with the League of Nations Covenant?</h3>
<p>Czech Foreign Minister Beneš spoke to a reporter from Roma's Il Piccolo, discussing the issue of reorganizing the League of Nations. In his opinion (the various difficulties encountered by the League of Nations cannot be attributed to its poor organization, nor to the incompleteness of the Covenant, nor to the inappropriate provisions of the Covenant regarding the relationship between large and small countries. Therefore, even if the League of Nations Covenant is amended, it will not eliminate its difficulties, and the situation will not improve. Our ambition is to uphold the current League of Nations. We believe that the League of Nations Covenant is a perfect expression of modern political science and political practice. The various international difficulties are actually due to the competition among major powers, and the greatest difficulty today is the difference in the political systems of various countries. To say that the League of Nations must be reorganized is tantamount to saying that the current League of Nations should be abolished. However, considering the current situation, if the League of Nations is abolished, the international situation will inevitably fall into chaos, which we earnestly believe is unacceptable.) (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<h3>Poland Expresses Sympathy for France</h3>
<p>Warsaw Yesterday, French Foreign Minister Peng Gu declared to the press that French policy is always based on the League of Nations. Even if the organization of the League is reformed, it cannot harm the fundamental principles of the League, that is, the rights of all countries should be respected. Today, it was reported that French Foreign Minister Peng Gu plans to visit Warsaw, Moscow, Romania, and Prague to return the visits. The political circles here are delighted to hear both pieces of news. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Editorials are Inconsistent</h3>
<p>(Paris) After French Foreign Minister Peng Gu clarified France's adherence to the main principles of the League of Nations to the press on Friday, editorials in various newspapers differed. Le Petit Parisien rejected amending the Covenant, saying that if France and Britain united to defend the League of Nations, it could withstand all attacks without harm. L'Écho de Paris praised Peng Gu's attitude, saying that various signs seemed to indicate that French foreign policy would undergo a complete reorganization. The operation of the League of Nations Covenant has always been detrimental to France's interests and has hindered France's actions. The current state of inaction in Geneva is beneficial to France because it can promote amendments. L'Ère Nouvelle, led by Herriot, expressed satisfaction with France's efforts to resist attempts to amend the Covenant, saying that Peng Gu's trip to Warsaw and Prague could also prove that all roads do not necessarily lead to Rome. In addition, the famous reporter Belesse wrote an article in Le Journal, supporting the principles of Peng Gu's declaration, but believing that a new system must be established to replace the League of Nations because the existing League of Nations has been sentenced to death.

<h3>Revising the Clauses of the Peace Treaty Concerns France's Security; Will Lobby Allied Countries to Unite for Self-Defense; Unexpected Secondary Trip to Germany to Solicit Opinions; Plan to Reconcile Germany and Russia Fails</h3>
<p>(London) The theory of the reorganization of the League of Nations is still a matter of careful consideration in the capitals of European countries, and the future of the Disarmament Conference under the League of Nations will be affected, which is particularly concerned. France regards the implementation of the clauses of the Treaty of Versailles as the basis for France's security and other interests, so it opposes the revision of the clauses of the treaty. The center of the current situation lies in this point. France is also unwilling to abandon the friendship of the South and North Slavic countries and Romania, the so-called Little Entente countries. This can be seen from the fact that French Foreign Minister Peng Gu will visit Warsaw, Belgrade, and Bucharest after Christmas. Peng Gu's mission to visit the capitals of various countries is naturally mainly aimed at consolidating the connection between France and the Little Entente countries, and to persuade the countries with the intention that France will defend its interests and resist the great powers' arbitrary actions. Several parties in France advocate negotiating with Germany on the Saar issue, but all parties oppose Germany's restoration of armaments. Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich left today for Berlin to discuss the basis for the reorganization of the League of Nations, and will probably also solicit Germany's specific measures on disarmament issues. The French side now claims that the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's plan to reconcile Germany and Russia and restore their harmony has failed. People in London believe that after the reorganization of the League of Nations, Japan can rejoin the League of Nations purely for humanitarian and cultural reasons, but otherwise, Japan has no benefit to rejoin the League of Nations. As for the attitude of the United Kingdom, it is determined that the Disarmament Conference should not be abandoned halfway in any case, but some people also say that the League of Nations has previously tried to unite two opposing things into one, these two things are promoting peace and forcing peace. According to the opinions of these people, all sanctions and guarantee clauses must be deleted from the League of Nations Covenant. (Reuters Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<h3>Pan-American League: Not Combined with the League of Nations; U.S. Delegation Statement of Attitude; Clear Division of Peaceful Cooperation</h3>
<p>Montevideo A spokesman for the U.S. delegation today stated that the United States has no intention of making the Pan-American Conference lose its individuality and appearance and closely combine it with the League of Nations. In Europe, it was said that U.S. Secretary of State Hull had already foreseen that the Pan-American League would become a supplementary mechanism of the League of Nations, so the U.S. delegation spokesman made this statement and said that although the United States is always willing to cooperate with any organization aimed at promoting world peace and welfare, it must insist on determining the boundaries of cooperation. (Kuomintang Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>Montevideo Today, the International Public Law Subcommittee of the Pan-American Conference decided to submit a proposal on one country not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries to the Pan-American Conference's plenary committee. According to the purpose of this proposal, it is aimed at the United States. The subcommittee is composed of seven countries: Cuba, Haiti, El Salvador, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile. Also today, Mexico proposed drafting a peace code in another peace subcommittee, including all existing agreements and treaties. According to the current situation, it seems that the Pan-American Conference will reconvene for two or three weeks before it can be concluded. (Kuomintang Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<h3>Avenol: Passes Through Paris to London; Meets with French Foreign Minister; Details of Visit to Italy</h3>
<p>(Paris) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol arrived here yesterday. After getting off the train, he visited French Foreign Minister Peng Gu and had a long conversation. Avenol had detailed to Peng the intentions of the Italian Fascist Grand Council's resolutions regarding his recent conversations in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, as well as the current situation of the League of Nations in Geneva, the diplomatic outpost contacts of various countries on the League of Nations issue, and so on. Afterwards, Avenol met with representatives of the press, stating that Peng Gu's declaration last Friday had greatly clarified the situation. He wished to report the general position of the French government to the British government so that there would be no misunderstanding. Later, Avenol left France for England on Sunday morning.

<h3>European Diplomatic Activities</h3>
<p>British Chargé d'Affaires Meets with French Foreign Minister (Paris) This afternoon, Foreign Minister Peng Gu met with British Chargé d'Affaires to France Campbell. Currently, diplomatic activities are bustling in the capitals of European countries, and the meeting between Campbell and Peng Gu is one of these meetings. British Ambassador to France Lord Tyrrell is still in London, so the British government ordered Chargé d'Affaires Campbell to report the British government's preliminary impressions of the current various issues to Peng Gu, and Peng Gu also informed Campbell of his intention to visit Warsaw and Prague, because Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and Czech Foreign Minister Beneš had both personally visited Paris. Peng Gu's trip is to return the visit. The travel dates are approximately in mid-January or early February and have not yet been determined. (Havas Telegraph, 9th)</p>

<h3>French Cabinet Responds to Congress: Displays Amazing Strength; Two Votes of Confidence for Financial Bills; Delays Responding to Italian and German Proposals</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chautemps cabinet has been able to demonstrate its amazing strength in the Chamber of Deputies in the face of numerous attacks. Tonight, it actually won two majority votes of confidence. The first article of the financial bill passed with 403 votes against 63, and the sixth article, which also involved civil servant salary reductions, also passed with 345 votes against 158. The second vote was particularly telling of the current government's strength because the 158 votes represented the various right-wing opposition parties. The Socialist Party, which was originally among those opposing the salary reduction, did not participate in the debate during the first comparison of forces, and withdrew from the meeting, giving up its vote. However, in the second vote, they joined the vote, and the victory still belonged to the government. However, the financial bill still needs to be approved by the Senate. It is expected that the Senate will amend the original bill of the Chamber of Deputies, focusing more on cost-cutting and less on taxation. At that time, the original bill may be returned to the Chamber of Deputies for a second reading, and the result will be a struggle between the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, which will eventually change the original appearance of the original bill and place the government in a weak but still vital position. At this point, the government will submit a reply to German Chancellor Hitler's proposals on disarmament and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's proposals on the reorganization of the League of Nations. If the international situation becomes more acute, France may organize a government of national unity. Before the vote in the Chamber of Deputies, Prime Minister Chautemps issued a serious warning, asking not to prolong the political turmoil, which would cause domestic turmoil and attacks by international speculators, saying that although France is outwardly tranquil, it is actually panicked. Those who are fond of troublemaking incite the people to demand the dissolution of the Congress and the revision of the Constitution. The walls of France are now covered with leaflets (expelling members of Congress). He is willing to use various methods granted by law to defend the Congress, but the Congress must also support him so that the people know that the Congress can fulfill its duties.

<h3>Japanese Navy Holds Unprecedented Large-Scale Exercises Three Years Early: New Tactics Tested in the Pacific Ocean with the United States as the Hypothetical Enemy</h3>
<p>▲China United News Agency Tokyo Communication The Japanese Navy practiced combat in the waters near the Ogasawara Islands and Taiwan this year, and learned many lessons from testing new weapons and new tactics. The Japanese Navy's special grand exercise was originally scheduled to be held once every four years. The next grand exercise should be held in 1937. The Navy believes that naval battles will take place between 1935 and 1936, so it decided to start the special grand exercise earlier. It is heard that the Navy's headquarters has decided to conduct exercises at sea in the South Seas in August and September next year, dividing the exercises into three phases. In the first phase of the operation, it will gather its elite troops on the South Seas mandated islands to practice intercepting a certain country's fleet sailing to the East from Honolulu. The air force and submarine force will be the main force for the expedition. The second phase of the operation will be in the Taiwan Strait, practicing the confrontation between main battleships. The third phase of the operation will be in the Pacific coastal area of Japan, conducting the final offensive and defensive battles. Lieutenant General Suetsugu will serve as the commander of the Combined Fleet. The commanders of the Second Fleet, Yokosuka, Kure, and Sasebo will each serve as their commanders. The warships participating will be the First and Second Fleets, the security ships and reserve ships belonging to the various garrison headquarters and naval port departments, and all will be ordered to be dispatched. Naval aviation teams and land service soldiers from various locations will also participate. Its scale will be the largest exercise since the opening of the country.</p>

<h3>Japanese Puppets Actively Sabotage the Chinese Eastern Railway: Western Section Operations Are at a Standstill; Railway Workers Suffer Humiliation; Russia Lodges Protest with the Puppet Government</h3>
<p>Blagoveshchensk This place received news from Harbin that the Manchurian representatives of the Chinese Eastern Railway are single-mindedly carrying out their illegal actions to sabotage railway operations. Tian Xifu (transliteration), the Manchurian deputy director of the railway's transportation department, who claims to be the director of the transportation department, recently set off without authorization to inspect the western section of the railway. Tian, together with Japanese advisor Sato, colluded to do evil, creating a situation where the western section of the railway was on the verge of suspension through various illegal actions and orders. Therefore, the Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Slavutsky, met with Shi Luben, the Manchurian negotiator stationed in Harbin, and lodged a strong official protest against the transfer and arrest of two Soviet citizens at Boketou Station. One of these two was the deputy section chief of that section, Cherevko, and the other was the accountant, Markovsky. Markovsky was also beaten severely by Sato. Consul General Slavutsky firmly demanded the immediate release of these illegally arrested personnel and the immediate recall of Sato to Harbin to investigate his behavior and the circumstances of his beating of the Soviet people. When making the above-mentioned demands, Mr. Slavutsky stated that the actions of illegally replacing Soviet people with Chinese were actually a policy of continuing to seize the railway.

<h3>The Japanese Political Situation Remains Chaotic: Conflicts Between Internal Affairs, the Military, and Zaibatsu; Araki Cultivates Political Power, Waiting for Change; Political Parties Seize Goto's Possible Resignation as an Opportunity to Overthrow the Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The future of the Japanese internal affairs conference remains very chaotic. Various factions are using Agriculture Minister Goto's possible resignation as material to overthrow the cabinet. Army Minister Araki's attitude is unpredictable. After the five-minister conference, the army authorities predicted that the cabinet would resign en masse before the internal affairs conference. Army Minister Araki then convened a meeting of army leaders in Fukui City, planning to make the upcoming political change beneficial to the military. In terms of foreign policy, they advocated convening a conference on East Asian peace. Domestically, they would announce the so-called military's plan for national reconstruction, thoroughly reform the capitalist system, and solve rural problems, preparing for military rule. However, Prime Minister Saito and the zaibatsu were good at forbearance and handled the situation properly, so the coup was avoided. As a result of this failure, Army Minister Araki changed his passive policy and began to cultivate political power, waiting for political opportunities to mature. He would then actively overthrow the cabinet and implement a military-led cabinet. After the failure of the Fukui meeting, Army Minister Araki's attitude appeared very passive on the surface. He ordered Lieutenant General Koiso to suspend his return to Japan, stopped the South Manchuria Railway reorganization movement advocated by radical elements in the military, allocated army ministry reserve funds to the navy ministry, mediated budgetary disputes, and ordered Army Affairs Bureau Chief Yamaoka to dissolve gatherings of young officers who opposed the Saito cabinet. He went from attempting to overthrow the cabinet to supporting the Saito cabinet. This was because preparations for military rule were not complete, and any political change would still leave power in the hands of political parties. Therefore, Araki was criticized by young army officers within the ministry. Given Araki's position, his enthusiasm for the internal affairs conference was far less than before the Fukui meeting. As for the zaibatsu, because Agriculture Minister Goto strongly advocated agricultural cooperatives to reform rural areas and correct the basic organization of capitalists, their interests were also incompatible with the zaibatsu. They have lost their support. Commerce Minister Nakajima will represent the interests of the zaibatsu, opposing the agriculture minister's countermeasures under the guise of supporting small and medium-sized businesses. Political parties are also using Saito's possible resignation as an opportunity to overthrow the cabinet. In this situation, the future of the internal affairs conference is bleak.

<h3>Spain: Riots Spread Across the Country, Approaching the Threshold of Revolution; Anarchist Party Engages in Large-Scale Sabotage; Fierce Fighting Occurs in Various Places, Resulting in Numerous Casualties</h3>
<p>Madrid, Spain, has once again approached the threshold of revolution. Anarchists have created a reign of terror throughout the country. According to unofficial and incomplete reports, the death toll so far is between twenty and forty, and the number of injured is no less than several hundred. Communication with the centers of disturbance has yet to be established. According to official reports from Zaragoza Province, there have been seven deaths and more than forty injuries in that province alone. However, the security forces often send the dead directly to the cemetery for burial and do not immediately report them, so the number of deaths in that province is likely to be higher. According to reports, the riots initially broke out on Saturday morning in the provinces of Barcelona, Zaragoza, and Logroño, and quickly spread elsewhere. The police and security forces have reported twice that they could control the situation, but the anarchists have repeatedly intensified their efforts. Even in Madrid, the unrest began on Saturday evening, with bomb explosions heard throughout the city. Interior Minister Averlo admitted that the situation remains difficult to control. The situation in Catalonia has not changed, but the authorities have been able to control the situation. In Valencia, anarchists blew up a railway bridge between Buñol and Utiel, causing the trains to fall into the valley. Unofficial estimates suggest that at least twenty-five people have died and seventy-one have been injured in the area. However, the Spanish government believes that the danger has passed and order will gradually be restored. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid: After extreme revolutionaries rioted in northeastern Spain, resulting in approximately twenty deaths and hundreds of injuries, the authorities announced today that the entire country is in a state of alert. This is the initial step towards declaring martial law. Several locations across the country are still experiencing street battles, and property losses are increasing daily. Although the official announcement tonight states that the revolutionary riots have been suppressed, three villages in Logroño Province are still occupied by revolutionary parties. Two regiments of cavalry are currently rushing to the riot-stricken areas. Around Zaragoza University today, individuals threw sulfuric acid and engaged in fighting. In Tomelloso, a general strike has been declared, and the police station there is currently surrounded by two hundred anarchists. The events in Alcañiz were even more violent, with the revolutionary party burning down the town hall and declaring a Soviet system. Seville has been transformed into a fortress, with military police ordered to shoot any revolutionary party members on sight. Machine guns have been positioned at all key points. These events were incited by extreme and revolutionary factions following the victory of right-wing parties in the recent parliamentary elections. Violent elements armed with rifles, bombs, and pistols began their sabotage work as soon as the new parliament convened for its first meeting, with their initial focus on the nation's transportation arteries. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Huang Shaohong Returns to Beiping = Arriving in Beiping via Suiyuan and Shanxi = = Staying for a Few Days Before Heading South =</h3>
<p>Beiping dispatch: Interior Minister Huang Shaohong, after being ordered to inspect Inner Mongolia, departed from Beiping by special train on October 28th, along with Zhao Pilian, the vice-chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and accompanying personnel, to Suiyuan and then Baillingmiao. He discussed and finalized the principles for resolving the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy. He also returned to Suiyuan to participate in the Mongolian-Han joint celebration. On the 3rd of this month, he traveled from Suiyuan with Zhao Pilian to Taiyuan to meet with Yan Xishan, where they discussed the Inner Mongolian issue and received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek soliciting Yan Xishan's views on the current situation. Huang then concluded his business and left Taiyuan on the Zhengtai Railway at 7:00 PM on the evening of the 7th, transferring to the Pinghan Railway car via Shijiazhuang and arriving in Beiping at 2:10 PM yesterday (the 8th). He Yingqin, representing Xu Ying, Public Security Bureau Chief Yu Jinhe, Zhangjia's representative Li Jianzhang, and over ten others welcomed him at the station. After Huang alighted from the train, he briefly greeted the welcoming party and then went to the Beijing Hotel to rest. At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Huang visited He Yingqin at Jurentang to discuss his trip to Mongolia and Shanxi. He then visited Huang Fu at the Political Readjustment Committee and left after a brief conversation. He Yingqin hosted a banquet at Jurentang at 8:00 PM last night to welcome Huang, and invited Huang Fu, Jiang Menglin, and others to accompany him. Huang is scheduled to stay in Beiping for two or three days before returning to Beijing to report on his mission. According to Huang's account of his trip to Mongolia, which is briefly recorded below:</p>
<h3>Huang Shaohong Speaks</h3>
<p>Huang said, "The Inner Mongolian autonomy issue has been resolved satisfactorily. This trip to Mongolia for negotiations went smoothly, thanks to the guidance of public opinion. Regarding the organization of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region government, the authorities of the three provinces of Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan have all agreed in principle. After I return to Beijing to report, the Central Political Council will finalize the principles and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for the passage of the organizational law, which can then be implemented. Prince Yun and Prince De, after contributing their views on Inner Mongolian autonomy to the central government, have sent representatives to Beijing. The rumor that a preparatory committee will be formed before the establishment of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region government has not yet been confirmed. Before I left Baillingmiao, because I was unable to visit all the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia, I specially dispatched Kong Qingzong, Ochirk, and a Mr. Li, the director of the Political Group of the expedition headquarters, to inspect the Ulanqab League. Another group, including the Military Group's Chi Zhongkuan, Yang Junli, and Zhao Wenru, were dispatched to inspect the Xilingol League, and are expected to return to Beijing within a month. Regarding the rumor that the Japanese intend to carve out Dolon as the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, I have heard of it. Dolon is still under Japanese occupation, so it must await the government's diplomatic resolution. As for my impressions of Mongolia, Mongolia is a good land for the country, but the government has not paid attention to it in the past. If it is given a sound organization and development in the future, its prospects are limitless. One part of my report on the inspection of Inner Mongolia is being drafted, and the other part will be completed after I return to Beijing and receive the reports from the personnel dispatched to inspect the various leagues. [November 29th, Suiyuan held a Han-Mongol joint celebration. Key attendees: 1. Wang Jingguo, 2. Fu Zuoyi, 3. Huang Shaohong, 4. Zhao Pilian, 5. Prince Pan, 6. Representative of Prince Donggong, 7. Representative of Zhangjia, 8. Prince Yun's son, 9. Prince Pan's son (For details, see the major news in this newspaper on the 5th of this month).] This time, the purpose of going to Taiyuan was to meet Yan Baichuan and seek his opinion on the Inner Mongolian issue, and the current situation was not discussed. The rumor that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed me to go to the Southwest is not accurate. Fu Yisheng (Zuoyi) and Zhao Zhiqing (Pilian) are still in Taiyuan, and it is not yet certain when they will come to Beiping. After I meet with Chairmen He and Huang in the next day or two, I will stay in Beiping for two or three days before returning to Beijing to report."</p>
<h3>Pangjiang Meeting</h3>
<p>An important person from Inner Mongolia arrived in Beiping today (the 9th) from Suiyuan to discuss important matters. According to his remarks: (1) The Mongol princes are generally satisfied with the results of the Baillingmiao meeting regarding the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, but the Mongolian youth have expressed that they are still dissatisfied. However, it is hoped that the government can implement the resolutions of the meeting so that there will not be any more problems. (2) When Prince De returned to the Xilingol League from Baillingmiao, he convened a meeting of the princes of the Xilingol League and the Ulanqab League in Pangjiang. The content of the discussions included the issues of sending representatives to the central government to participate in meetings, protecting the Inner Mongolian border, and establishing the first autonomous region government. The Alxa League will also convene a similar meeting in Suiyuan in the coming days. As for the production of representatives, the league will be the unit, not the banner. (3) The locations of the first and second autonomous region governments will be determined only after the promulgation of the Organic Law of the Autonomous Government. (4) The delegation produced at the Baillingmiao meeting will set up an office in Prince De's mansion, but the official representatives have not yet been produced. (9th)</p>
<h3>Consolidation of Border Defenses in Zhejiang and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Central Air Force has dispatched reconnaissance missions over Nanchang for communications, Guixi, Yanshan, Shangrao, Guangfeng, and Yushan in northeastern Jiangxi; Guangze, Chong'an, and Pucheng in Fujian; and Kaihua, Changshan, Jiangshan, and the intertwined Xianxia Mountains in Zhejiang. Since the Fujian army's invasion of the Zhejiang border, the situation at the borders of the three provinces has become increasingly critical. The Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi, seeing an opportunity, are also attempting to take advantage of the conflict by moving north along the Jiangxi-Fujian border towards the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Anhui border, hoping to seize weapons and supplies from the two warring armies. During the Xiang-Gui War in the 19th year [of the Republic, 1930], the Red bandits were entrenched in the areas of Xianning, Tongcheng, and Pingjiang, secretly seizing numerous weapons during the advance and retreat of the two armies. They are now attempting to replicate this tactic. To consolidate the defenses along the Jiangxi-Zhejiang border, the central government has not only appointed Zhao Guantao as the Border Defense Commander of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Anhui, responsible for vigilance, but has also deployed troops from various locations for defense. According to military sources, the Fujian army has already mobilized from Yanping and Jian'ou, showing signs of eagerness to attack. However, the central government's forces have already arrived at key locations and established contact with units north of Fujian [illegible] and [illegible], and deployments are nearing completion. Should the Fujian troops dare to invade, they will be met with a head-on counterattack. Moreover, the strength of the central government's forces is substantial, and air support can be deployed when necessary to assist the ground forces. Although there has been no direct engagement yet, the air force is busy with reconnaissance and distributing leaflets. Therefore, aircraft are constantly circling and soaring over the borders of the three provinces. (December 6th)</p>

<h3>The Eve of the New German Parliamentary Election (European Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Today is a day of remembrance, and tomorrow is also a day of remembrance. Flag-waving, meetings, speeches, parades, and slogans - this is the unique characteristic of Germany after Hitler came to power. Everywhere, from streets to alleys, swastika flags and the red, white, and black German flag are always fluttering in the wind. All newspapers in the country have been unified, not only in their opinions but also in their striving for stimulating richness. "Heil Hitler!" is the first sentence people say when they enter your room. Young Brownshirt party members march in groups of three or five, chests puffed out, up and down the streets. Every Sunday, there is always someone selling badges or flowers on the street to raise money for some organization. This happens at almost every street corner because the first chapter of Hitler's political lecture is that Germany is in a time of national crisis and the people should do their best to provide relief. Although it seems that the more relief there is, the more economically distressed the country becomes, according to Propaganda Minister Goebbels, the German people are currently the happiest people in the world because they have a kind of faith leading them forward. However, ordinary people's feelings are clearly not the same. It seems that whoever can create bread is the savior. But this is entirely due to the emotional stimulation and the power of propaganda, which is the fundamental secret of Hitler's success. How long can it last? This is indeed becoming a problem.</p>
<p>If the unemployment problem is not resolved, Hitler's position will not be secure. Recently, the official announcement stated that the number of unemployed has been reduced to only 3.7 million. This is clearly difficult for people to believe. Hitler proudly boasts that he has given more than 2.2 million unemployed workers jobs. But there is a question: why hasn't the national income tax revenue increased even though more than 2 million jobs have been created? Why is the general economic situation worse than before after the state has received countless voluntary donations from the people? If the number of unemployed has really decreased, shouldn't the opposite be true?</p>
<p>People need stimulation to become enthusiastic. The German people are currently intoxicated by this patriotic fervor, dreaming of Germany's resurgence. But because it is a dream, there will inevitably be a time to wake up. The danger lies here. Therefore, Hitler must change some new tricks, increase the stimulation, and shift the people's focus. The withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference serves this purpose. Because Hitler cannot abruptly change his policies for no reason, like some defenseless women who preach (non-war) theories, he must have some excuse to make it seem like it is not sudden. Therefore, his internal agenda is greater than his external one. So, on the one hand, he withdrew from Geneva, and on the other hand, he proposed a new treaty to France to show that Germany has no ambition to oppose France. At the same time, he dissolved the parliament, prepared for a new election, and asked the people to vote on this policy to ease their opposition and take the opportunity to further consolidate his power.</p>
<p>This election is scheduled for November 12th, and a referendum will be held at the same time. The methods are generally the same, but the fundamental difference is that in the past, there was a multi-party system, and voters could freely choose and elect whomever they wanted. This time, it is a one-party system, so there is only one party name on the ballot, and more than 90% of the 685 candidates are from the National Socialist Party. In this case, the outcome of the election is easy to see at a glance.</p>
<p>Below are the parliamentary election ballot and the referendum ballot. The former is on white paper, and the latter is on green paper. Parliamentary Election (District X) ○ National Socialist German Workers' Party (Hitler Movement) Streicher Hess Frick Goering Goebbels Roehm Darré Bappen Hugenberg</p>
<p>German government's announcement to the people! (The united will of the German government and the German people to implement a coordinated and peaceful policy…)</p>
<p>(The government poses a question to the German people:)</p>
<p>Do the German people approve of the policies implemented by their government, and do they declare them as their own views and aspirations, and formally approve them? Berlin, October 14, 1933, German Government</p>
<p>——————————Do you approve, German men and women, of your government's policy, and do you want to declare it as your own views and aspirations and formally approve it? Yes ○ No ○ Parliamentary election ballot: voters only need to draw a cross or other mark in the circle to make it an official election. Referendum ballot: voters who draw a cross in the circle under the word "Yes" are considered to have voted in favor; if they draw a cross in the other circle, it is a vote against.</p>
<p>In past elections, because there was competition between the parties, the atmosphere before the election was very different from this time. Although Hitler has nothing to fear from this election, he and other government officials must still try their best to embellish it, making it more solemn and less monotonous. After Hitler delivered his first election speech in Berlin on October 24, he traveled to major cities across the country to continue speaking. At the same time, important government officials, such as Hess, Frick, Goering, Goebbels, and Bappen, also tried their best to portray the situation. In summary, their opinions are just as a slogan says: "We do not want war, we need peace, we need security for internal construction of culture and economy," or "(We need a glorious equality of armaments and peace.)" Peace, peace - it is truly the most fashionable noun in Germany today. According to their explanation, peace does not mean surrendering to foreign powers. First, because war is too cruel. Hitler said that only soldiers on the front lines understand how terrible war is, so Germany is determined not to have another war with France. Second, war is enough to destroy all culture, especially the loss of good young people. In addition, there is the Red problem, and so on. Therefore, war is meaningless today. Unfortunately, Hitler's arguments did not have much effect abroad. France feels that if Germany is not resolved now, it will be more difficult in the future. They simply do not believe Hitler's words. The general impression within the country is that he has said so much, but in the end, he will still have to compromise with France. It seems that the previous government was much better than him. This view is quite widespread, but it is not easy to see under the current power.</p>
<p>In addition to ordinary speeches, Hitler specifically delivered a major speech to workers at the Siemens factory in Berlin on November 10. The ceremony was very grand. All factories across the country stopped work completely from 1 pm to 2 pm. People from all walks of life were required to gather in their respective organizations to listen to his speech via wireless telephone. From 1 pm, the whole country stopped for one minute. At that time, all factories broadcast sirens in unison. On busy streets, whether it was cars, trams, or pedestrians, everything stopped immediately with a wave of the police baton and entered a state of complete silence. Then Hitler began to deliver his heart-shaking speech, as usual, but the content was still similar, only emphasizing the desire for peace, the importance of this election, and that he had given more than 2 million people jobs and bread, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of class coordination versus class struggle, etc. In addition, on November 11, President Hindenburg delivered a final election speech. In addition to the speeches, almost all the newspapers in the country were mobilized. You will not find a newspaper in Germany that has a different opinion. Everyone always finds many reasons to prove in unison that this election and referendum in Germany are tied to the fate of Germany. If the German people want Germany to be free from French aggression and Red destruction and to achieve resurgence, they must support Hitler's struggle for Germany's claims to peace, honor, and equality of armaments. In the newspapers, Hitler's position today is much higher than that of Bismarck in the past ("Our Leader," "The Liberator of Germany"). In particular, the withdrawal from the League of Nations has won the praise of some people.</p>
<p>In addition to written propaganda, there are many illustrations in the newspapers, most of which illustrate the fullness of the enemy's armaments and the emptiness of Germany's national defense. Special propaganda is also directed at women, saying that German children will be in danger of being bombed by enemy planes in the future. If German mothers want to protect the safety of their children, they must support Hitler's peaceful policies.</p>
<p>Along the streets, slogans and posters can be seen everywhere. The most eye-catching are the portraits of Hindenburg and Hitler, with large titles: ("The General (referring to Hindenburg) and the Corporal (referring to Hitler, who was a sergeant in the European War) are fighting together for our peace and equality of armaments"). Some use the title in extremely large letters: "Glorious Peace," followed by a small-print explanation of the internal and external significance of Hitler's policies. The most practical is a slightly pink poster that says, in essence, "Look at the achievements of the Hitler government in the past eight months: first, it has given more than 2.2 million people jobs and bread; second, it has eradicated communism; third, it has overthrown the parties that advocated class struggle; fourth, it has eliminated the small political parties; fifth, it has brought peace to the country; sixth…" In addition, there were large-scale parades in the days before the election, and at night, many cars were filled with young members of the National Socialist Party, equipped with dazzling electric lights, singing party songs and chanting slogans in a very sad tone. This was not only in the big cities, but also in small towns. The German people were really touched by his emotional words. However, whether this group of people can be directed by him for a long time depends on his handling skills in the future. Of course, the most important thing is still the economic aspect, to see if he can get through this difficult winter.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the new parliament elected this time will be entirely under the control of the National Socialist Party, and there will be no room for change. In the referendum, Hitler will probably get 80% to 90% of the votes in favor. Hitler once said that whoever does not participate in the election is a traitor. The German people are all trembling these days, and who dares to take the risk? After Hitler's statement, even those who hold a passive attitude against the government have no choice but to participate in the election, otherwise, there will inevitably be danger. Therefore, the number of voters this time will probably not be less than before. In this election, in addition to his existing supporters, a part of the neutral faction has also been influenced by him. Many people do not have a very good impression of Hitler himself, but because of the propaganda, it is said that this referendum has a special relationship with diplomacy, and many people will vote in favor based on their opposition to France. On the other hand, people in small villages cannot cast a negative vote due to geographical and population reasons, because it is very easy to be found out. Therefore, 10% to 20% of the negative votes are only in big cities, such as Berlin and Hamburg, where it is impossible to distinguish them. Only then do some members of the opposition dare to express themselves clearly.</p>
<p>The internal significance of this election is probably as described above. As for the external effect, it is difficult to predict at this moment. Perhaps France will still be dissatisfied with Hitler's concessions and will send troops to occupy the Rhineland. Then the problem will be quite serious. The tense situation caused by the recent Danzig incident proves that the French have not felt satisfied. Evening of November 10, Continental Europe</p>
<h3>Fellow Mongolians Hold a Celebration in Beiping</h3>
<p>Bai Yunti Discusses the Tasks of the Celebration, Beiping Correspondence. Bai Yunti, a Mongolian member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, Prince Nayantu of Outer Mongolia, and Li Fenggang, the director of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission's office in Beiping, initiated a celebration for fellow Mongolians on the 10th at the office of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission in Beiping. More than 80 fellow Mongolians from Inner and Outer Mongolia residing in Beiping were invited to participate. According to Bai Yunti today (9th), the celebration is to invite fellow villagers to gather together for casual talks, and no formal issues are scheduled to be discussed. The Inner Mongolia autonomy issue has been properly resolved, and the association of fellow villagers in Beiping sent representatives to Bailing Temple to participate in the matter. They have returned to Beiping for many days and are scheduled to report on the progress of the resolution at the celebration tomorrow, and discuss ways to reorganize the association. The frequent disturbances in Mongolian-Tibetan schools are really a mistake for Mongolian-Tibetan youth, and are of great importance to the future of Mongolian-Tibetan education. It is necessary to strictly rectify them. When the meeting is held tomorrow, it will be proposed for discussion and a concrete method will be formulated to improve them. After the meeting, I will go to Beijing on the 16th of this month to attend the Fourth Plenary Session and take office as an Executive Committee member. After the meeting, I will return to Beiping and go to Inner Mongolia. The reorganization of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission's Border Administration Department is expected to be realized in January next year. The organizational content has not yet been determined. The central government expects Minister Huang (Shaohong) to be the candidate for the minister. The Japanese side strongly wants to set up a radio station in the East Ujimqin Banner, but it has been rejected by the local Mongolian flag leaders. However, the Japanese side has a strong attitude, and more than a dozen Japanese officials are still staying in Xilin Gol League, and the League Leader, Suo Wangfu, has not left. Both sides are in negotiations. (9th) The Han-Mongolian Grand Celebration, 1. Mrs. Fu Zuoyi, 2. Fu's son, 3,4.

<h3>Sichuan Bandit Suppression Army Makes Progress on Five Routes – Headquarters on Each Route Pushed Forward – Liu Xiang Announces Victory, Encirclement of Sui and Xuan Imminent</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Routes of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Army launched a general offensive on all fronts on the 1st. After five days of bloody battles, they finally cleared the bandits on the south bank of the Qu River. On the 7th, they crossed the Qu River and moved towards Sui and Xuan to suppress the bandits. The 1st and 2nd Routes are also preparing for a general offensive against Bazhong and Yilong. Liu Xiang, believing that the liaison between the routes has been established and the encirclement is gradually closing, will order all command posts to be moved forward. The 1st Route Army under Deng Xihou will leave Zhaohua and Jiange, with the command post stationed in Jiange; the 2nd Route under Tian Songyao will leave Nanbu and Baoning, with the command post stationed in Baoning; the 3rd Route Army under Li Qixiang and the 4th Route Army under Yang Sen will leave Nanchong and Yingshan, with the command post stationed in Yingshan; and the 5th Route Army under Wang Lingji and the 6th Route under Liao Zhen will leave Kaijiang and Qu County, with the command post stationed in Kaijiang. He also ordered the blockade of the bandit areas, strictly preventing the import of rice, salt, iron, and medicines. Rear cities such as Chengdu, Chongqing, and Wanxian have all announced martial law. He also imitated the current system in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and established Administrative Inspectors in the bandit areas, dividing them into six districts: Tongnan, Ba, and three counties in the first district, with the inspector stationed in Bazhong; Zhaoguang and three counties in the second district, with the inspector stationed in Guangyuan; Yiyingpeng and three counties in the third district, with the inspector stationed in Yingshan; Canglangnan and three counties in the fourth district, with the inspector stationed in Langzhong; Xuandachu and three counties in the fifth district, with the inspector stationed in Dazhou; and Chengwanyi and two counties in the sixth district, with the inspector stationed in Chengkou. Each commissioner is treated as a simplified appointment and also serves as the security commander of each district and the county magistrate of the resident location, to preside over both military and civilian affairs. In addition, two militia command headquarters were set up in Xiadong and northern Sichuan, with Wang Lingji and Xian Ying serving as the commander in chief. They also selected the elite of the militia to organize the Anti-Communist Volunteer Army and advance with the army to suppress the bandits. (9th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Discusses the Fujian Incident – Hopes for a Peaceful Resolution</h3>
<p>The Telegram to Chiang Was Fabricated, Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and the commander-in-chief of the Third Route Army, is an important general in North China. His views on the current situation are very important. Today (9th), the reporter specially went to visit him and inquire about everything. According to his account, the situation in Fujian has become tense in recent days, and war seems inevitable. However, I believe that it is best to resolve it peacefully, because the work of suppressing the communists in Jiangxi Province has not yet been completed. If force is used against Fujian, it seems that it cannot be ended in the shortest time. War will continue, lasting for a long time, which will not only affect the work of suppressing the communists, but also devastate the local area and cause suffering to the people, which will not help the matter. Furthermore, in the future, everything in China should be handled by peaceful political means, which cannot be resolved by force. The national crisis is so severe that lost land has not been recovered, and there should be no more wars in the country. This is the earnest hope of the general public, which cannot be ignored, because national affairs are the affairs of the people. Due to diplomatic relations, this province must maintain a steady attitude and cannot seek temporary personal reputation, which would cause harm to the local people. I now have only to do my best to rectify the military and political affairs of this province. Even if I relinquish my responsibility in the future, I must return the entire Shandong to the country and the people. As for the two small newspapers in Tianjin that published a telegram from me to Chairman Chiang, launching attacks against Xiong Shihui and He Xuezhua, this is purely a fabrication by villains to harm me. Chairman Chiang has now sent a reply, stating that he has not received the telegram and has telegraphed the two chairmen He and Huang in Beiping and Chairman Yu in Tianjin to thoroughly investigate the matter to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Levies Estate and Income Taxes = Tax Plan Already Drafted by the Taxation Department = = Implementation Awaits Legislative Yuan Decision =</h3>
<p>Beijing News: Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, considering the current national treasury deficit and the pressing need for funds for major government construction projects, urgently proposes to vigorously seek new sources of revenue to overcome financial difficulties. The idea of implementing estate tax and income tax has been put forward, and a tax plan has already been drafted by the Taxation Department. According to Gao Bingfang, the Director of the Department, the plan's content and progress can be summarized as follows: (The central government already has an established plan for collecting income tax, but it has not yet been implemented. It is similar in nature to the current income donation for civil servants, and does not apply to ordinary people. It applies to major banks, stores, factories, and companies in the country, and the amount of tax levied is determined by the amount of surplus at the end of each year. At a time when the national treasury is in deficit and foreign threats are increasing daily, it is believed that the business community, having gained huge profits under the protection of the government, will be happy to pay this small income tax rate to save the country from danger. The scope and amount of tax to be levied have already been drafted and submitted to the Minister for review, and will then be decided by the central government and the Legislative Yuan. Regarding the issue of collecting estate tax, the central government also had a plan long ago, and it has been practiced in various countries for a long time. Our country has not been able to implement it until now due to slightly different circumstances. A draft based on the established plan has now been prepared and submitted to the Minister for review, and then submitted to the Central Political Conference for decision by the Legislative Yuan. It is expected that this matter will definitely be implemented, but the timing of implementation is only a matter of sooner or later. The draft is based on the advantages of various countries' estate tax methods, and the content is very detailed. The implementation of this tax will not only enrich the national treasury, but also protect the inheritance rights of the people, and prevent disputes over inheritance after inheritance. The development of this legitimate source of tax revenue will benefit both the government and the people in the future.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Residents Request Provincial Government Relief Notes, Designating Provincial Bank to Issue Circulating Currency</h3>
<p>The heads of various banknote shops have been detained by the county government. News from Xuzhou: Following the banknote panic in Xuzhou Port, after the joint meeting of various sectors on the 6th decided on five strict measures for rectification, the county government immediately detained the persons in charge of various banknote shops that evening. The detainees included Zhang Tongci, the head of Chunquan Banknote Shop; Ding Yinzhou, the head of Yizhenxiang Banknote Shop; Zhang Jingxiu, the head of Shixingchang Banknote Shop; and Zhao Bangqing, the head of Tianbaoyu Banknote Shop. They were sent to the No. 8 Western Prison the next day. Bu Zhiping, the head of Shangxinji Banknote Shop, and Wang Fuqing, the head of Juhechang Banknote Shop, have not been detained. Only Bu's nephews Guangji and Guangyi, and Wang's nephew Daoyuan and sister-in-law, were summoned and held under custody by the Judicial Team, who were ordered to hand over Bu and Wang within three days. The assets of the No. 6 family were also sealed separately. Bu's nephew Guangji applied to the county government, stating that he was willing to raise funds within the nearest period to cash out and recover as much as possible. Wang Daoyuan also requested to find a way to cash out. The county government has ordered them to prepare a plan within two days. If they cannot do so within two days, the relevant responsible persons will still be detained and imprisoned for rectification. However, although Bu and Wang made this request, their actual assets may not be sufficient to cover the debts, and it is difficult to raise cash at the moment, so they cannot be cleared out for a while. The three representatives appointed by various sectors, namely Rui Zhenxiang, a member of the County Party Committee; Li Fengru, the Director of the Farmers' Association; and Lan Bohua, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, accompanied County Magistrate She Nianci to the provincial capital yesterday (the 8th) to petition. Wu Gengyu, the Provincial Committee member, had already returned to the province to report the purpose of the petition of the representatives, which was to request the provincial government to designate the Provincial Bank to issue circulating currency to collect banknote paper, using the property of the banknote merchants and the local arrears of surtax as collateral. Otherwise, as the end of the year is approaching, the banknote paper will circulate in the market and be worthless, and a social crisis can be predicted. The text of the petition is recorded as follows: (Presenting a situation where a large number of private banknotes have collapsed, without cash to redeem them, endangering the local area, humbly requesting verification and approval to designate a bank to issue circulating currency to collect banknote paper, in order to avoid harm and aid the people's livelihood. It is found that private banknotes in Tongshan have been circulating for a long time, and the improper management and crackdown has ultimately led to collapse. In the half-month since the run on banknotes, the cash of banknote merchants has become less and less, and the banknote paper to be redeemed has become more and more. In addition, local ruffians buy at a discount and take advantage of the situation to redeem, resulting in increasingly chaotic order and frequent unfortunate events. The county government then approved the request of the banknote merchants and announced that, starting from the 2nd of this month, redemption would be temporarily suspended for one month for rectification. It is noted that the one-month period will soon expire. If full redemption cannot be achieved by then, it will surely lose the trust of the people, the atmosphere will worsen day by day, and the society will become increasingly dangerous, or even unexpected events may occur. To engage in redemption on schedule, the funds relied on by banknote merchants are all dependent on debt collection and asset liquidation, which cannot be done urgently. Pondering and pondering, no solution can be found. I think that Tongshan is an important place connecting the north and south, with people from all directions living together, and the people are inherently fierce. At this time of economic recession, a large number of banknotes that are temporarily difficult to redeem are widely scattered among the people. The prices that ordinary poor farmers and peddlers exchange for their blood and sweat are like waste paper. Both the lunar and solar new years are difficult. If we do not quickly find a way to provide circulation and activity, the trend of deterioration will not only harm the local area, but also be a misfortune for the country. Our association and other representatives of the people cannot ignore it. After repeated planning, the only option is to use the assets of banknote merchants as collateral, and the bank will issue circulating currency to collect banknote paper. We will take a short time to liquidate assets and raise cash to exchange and sell circulating currency. The poison of paper money can be fundamentally eliminated and the recovery achieved. Fearing that the assets of various banknote merchants may be insufficient, we have jointly discussed and decided to include the arrears of surtax in the deposit as collateral, in order to seek peace of mind. Only the designation of a bank is a more important issue, which is beyond the power of the local government. Therefore, we have specially prepared a document with a joint signature, explaining the situation in detail, and sending representatives to the provincial capital overnight to plead for instructions. We hope that the Governor will care about the dangerous situation in the local area and the plight of the poor people, and sincerely verify and approve the handling as requested, so as to avoid harm and aid the people's livelihood. We are waiting for your urgent instructions.) In addition, the Student Union here, represented by representatives from Xuzhou Middle School, Girls' Middle School, Private Xuzhou School, Tongshan Teachers' School, and Art Vocational School, petitioned the Commissioner's Office yesterday, proposing two points: (1) Urging various banknote merchants to allow redemption on January 23, 1934; (2) Strictly prohibiting private discounting and trading of banknote paper. They received satisfactory answers. As for the Gongyu Silver House, the county government has clearly notified all shareholders to redeem on schedule, and the shareholders are also prepared to report the fraud of the managers and directors.

<h3>Songjiang Public Security Bureau Detects and Arrests Long-Time Bandits</h3>
<p>Regarding the robbery case at Wu Youlan's home in Zhujiahang, Punan, and the shooting of the victim, the County Public Security Bureau has strictly ordered detectives to solve the case within a time limit. It is now learned that the main culprit in the case, according to the detectives led by Team Leader Yang Shijie, is Jiangbei Gang, a long-time bandit in the county. The robbery cases in Caoging and Wuku were also committed by Xia Dasan and Mazizi. They are now hiding in a silk factory workshop behind the Xiangyan Bridge in Hongkou, Shanghai. Shen, the Bureau Chief, was informed and prepared a letter, which he handed over to Yang, who personally led detectives Ye Bingsheng and others to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to seek assistance yesterday. Lu Ying, the detective chief, accompanied them to the Fifth District Third Precinct, where police were dispatched to arrest Xia Dasan Mazizi, the bandit's wife Xia Gu, 22 years old, and three suspects, the Xu Rihuai tenants. They also went to a thatched house in Quanjia Temple and captured the bandit Xu Huaixiang, and confiscated a white leather suitcase and 13 pieces of various clothes. After registering at the Municipal Public Security Bureau, they took the four criminals and the赃物 to Songjiang. After a preliminary trial by the County Public Security Bureau, they will be sent to the Commissioner's Office for review.</p>
<h3>Illegal Activities of Salt and Sulfur Bureau Staff Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>The Songfengjin Salt and Sulfur Bureau's Smuggling Investigation and Verification Office previously suspected Yang Linshu, the head of the Fifth Group Tax Collection Office in Song County, of forging seals and documents for personal gain, and sent a public letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting assistance in arresting him. The Public Security Bureau detectives were investigating and arresting him when Yang was found by an employee of the Salt and Sulfur Bureau and temporarily detained in the bureau for three days. A report was submitted to the Provincial Bureau for instructions, and a letter was also sent to the Public Security Bureau to withdraw the public letter requesting assistance in the arrest.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Anti-Japanese Association's Case of Smuggling Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The malpractice of the Wuxian Anti-Japanese Association has aroused the attention of the people throughout the county. Gao Ziyan, a cadre sent by the County Party Committee, has investigated and found the following facts: (1) Yao Hongzhi, Chen Weizhi, and Gan Zhixing, members of the Anti-Japanese Association, colluded with unscrupulous merchants to organize the Wuxian News Newspaper. The motive was to facilitate the dumping of goods by unscrupulous merchants. Yao, Chen, and others organized the newspaper to cover up external attacks. Cheng Liquan of the foreign cloth industry and Sheng Zhixing of the Anti-Japanese Association came forward to invite guests to the Yichangfu Restaurant. About 20 managers of cloth shops inside and outside the city attended and agreed that each foreign goods store would contribute 50 yuan per share, collecting a total of 1,000 yuan as capital. Yao was appointed as the editor-in-chief, Chen as the accountant, and Sheng as the public relations officer. Those who contributed shares did not receive stock certificates. (2) The Hengda Transportation Company was organized to smuggle enemy goods, with Sun Dasan as the manager and Chen Weizhi as the assistant. (3) When the County Farmers' Association elected representatives to attend the Anti-Japanese Association, the cadres competed fiercely, resulting in a stalemate. A lottery was used to resolve the issue, and Chen Weizhi won. The Anti-Japanese Association committee members are unpaid, but the Farmers' Association cadres competed for it, indicating that they have long regarded it as a lucrative position. (4) The Anti-Japanese Association personnel divided the area into sections for unscrupulous merchants to smuggle enemy goods. Although no one in the foreign goods industry was responsible for explaining the situation, Daheng Cloth Shop in Gong Lane wrote "Anti-Japanese Association extorting 15 yuan" in its ledger, which is indeed a fact. The Party Committee investigator also submitted an opinion to the Party Committee, stating that public opinion is completely disgusted with the Anti-Japanese Association. Because the corrupt members of the Anti-Japanese Association are Party members, and the guiding agency of the Anti-Japanese Association is the Party Committee, it has damaged the people's faith in the Party Committee. In order to increase the Party's prestige, the case should be immediately submitted to the superior Party Committee for strict punishment, and the punishment should be publicly announced.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Arrears in Slaughter Tax Lead to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Xu Jigong, the director of the local slaughter tax collection office, previously found that Mao Jinshan, a tax collector in Qingcheng City, owed more than 800 yuan in taxes, and immediately submitted a request to the county government to summon Mao for questioning. According to Mao, the butchers also owed him more than 400 yuan in taxes, and he was unable to raise the money for a while. The county government detained him to recover the taxes. After more than 40 days, he still failed to pay, so the county government prepared a document to transfer him to the prosecutor's office of the county court, filing a public lawsuit against him for embezzlement. Yesterday, Judge Liu Bingzhen of the Criminal Court held a hearing and brought Mao Jinshan from the detention center. Xu Jigong also hired lawyer Tang Mingfeng to represent him in court. As a result, the court ordered Mao Jinshan to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Refugees Occupying and Disturbing</h3>
<p>In Chenjiaqiao, Xizhang, Fifth District (Tianshang City), more than 300 refugees from Anhui and Hubei provinces arrived on the morning of the day before yesterday, occupying and disturbing the area. They went to nearby Luxiang Village to seize chickens and livestock from villagers' homes. When the villagers stepped forward to interfere, they were arbitrarily beaten, causing great panic. The Yanqiao Public Security Thirteenth Branch was immediately notified, and police were dispatched to the scene to suppress the situation, and silver and rice were collected to force them to leave the area.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Xu Lvn'an Takes Over the Relief Institute</h3>

After accepting the appointment, Xu visited Secretary-General Cheng and Director Gu of the Provincial Government Department of Civil Affairs yesterday morning to ask for instructions on the direction of future reorganization and all promotion plans. It is reported that Director Gu gave detailed instructions immediately. In the afternoon at 2 o'clock, he went to the institute to visit the former director, Chen Sibai, to discuss the handover matters. It is reported that he will formally take over on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrest of Kidnappers by the Fourth District of the Water Police</h3>
<p>Xu Fengshan, the leader of the detective team of the Fourth District of the Water Police, recently personally led detectives Quan Lin and Yang Baokang, together with the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital, to break up a kidnapping gang led by Zhao Wenxiang and five others in a thatched shed and Yongxing Inn near Jingji Ridge. The team was transferred to the district headquarters for interrogation. According to the confession of the bandits, in the case of the kidnapping of the Chen Kaiguang family, the bandits were hiding in Fengjia Village, Nanguantang Bridge. At 9 pm that night, Team Leader Xu led detectives Quan Lin and Yang Baokang and more than a dozen detectives, armed with weapons, to the area together with Zhang Qingshan, a patrol officer of the 15th team of the district headquarters, to investigate and arrest the bandits. The Special Service Battalion of the Security Office also heard the news and sent two platoons of soldiers to the area to investigate the case. Two kidnapped boys were found in Feng Lu's home and taken directly to the Security Office by Deputy Officer Dan. Team Leader Xu continued to search house by house in the Wufengkou area and captured Zhang Bulou, the principal offender, and Zhang Sanshizi and two other suspects, and seized two box guns and 22 bullets. They were taken to the district headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Forging Recommendation Letters Leads to Four Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Fang Mianzhi, a county resident, forged recommendation letters from Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Department of Finance, and Ye Xiufeng, the Secretary of the Central Executive Committee, to visit Ma, the acting county magistrate, in an attempt to obtain a position. Ma discovered the forgery and sent Fang to the court for legal action. Yesterday, the Criminal Court of the court sentenced Fang Mianzhi to four months of imprisonment for the crime of forging documents.</p>
<h3>Nantong Changyinsha Lightship Robbed</h3>
<p>The Changyinsha lightship on the Yangtze River in Langshan, Nantong, was suddenly invaded by many river pirates who stole the lighthouse from the Jianghai Customs. The Haixing patrol ship pursued them without success. The Customs has installed a new lighthouse as the lightship is an important facility for indicating the Bai Mao Sha navigation route, and has requested the water police to protect the lighthouse keepers so that they can serve with peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Another Kidnapping Case in Shuangju Township</h3>
<p>In Shuangju Township, the 10th District of the county, the families of Xu Renshi and three others were robbed by bandits, and four men and women were kidnapped. There has been no news of them yet. Unexpectedly, more than 30 bandits with guns and weapons came again last night and swarmed to the homes of Xu Kuizeng, Xu Taihe, Xu Zhongrong and others, searching and looting. They used gun barrels to beat Kuizeng and the other two, leaving them covered in injuries. The bandits were still not satisfied and went to the neighboring homes to loot, causing considerable losses. Before leaving, they kidnapped Xu Kuizeng, Xu Taihe, and Xu Zhongrong, and ordered their families to quickly raise 5,000 silver dollars and send them to a certain grassy swamp to redeem the captives. Otherwise, they would set fire to their homes.</p>
<h3>Jiashan Victims of Rural Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>Qian Afu, a farmer from Jiuqu Township outside Xizha, Xitang, and his mother lived a simple life and could barely make ends meet. In recent years, they have suffered greatly from the impact of rural economic bankruptcy. The day before yesterday, they were forced by a bean cake shop in the town and a shop in Luxu due to outstanding debts. Unable to cope, Afu hanged himself last night. When his mother found him in the morning, he had already died. Afu's mother, who was 80 years old, was deeply saddened by the death of her son and died of grief.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrests of Tai Bao Ashu's Gang Members</h3>
<p>Although Tai Bao Ashu has been eliminated, many of his remaining subordinates are still rampant in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area, kidnapping and robbing ships, frequently heard. They even resisted the militia in Shenxiangdang in this county, causing the militia to fail and be completely wiped out, causing a sensation for a time. At that time, the public security agencies of the two provinces seriously searched for them, and they have been arrested one by one to this day. A summary is provided below: (1) Shitang Xiaodi (i.e., Zhang Axiao) was previously arrested in Shanghai by Xu Pucheng, the chief of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, who dispatched detective team leader Luo Daokun to lead the detectives. His wife Yang Xiubao and his biological mother Zhang were also arrested. At the same time, many military weapons were seized in his home in Shitang. (2) Two long-time bandits, Huangfa Axiao (real name Zhang Chunlin) and Huang Zhongfu (nickname Da Agui), fled to Yujiahui Dang in this county after learning that Shitang Xiaodi had been arrested. They were captured in Xinzhen by Li Xiaotang, the captain of the Qingpu Water Police Team, who dispatched patrol officer Zhou Gongda and Luo Dingxin, and squad leader Wu Xuesheng, who disguised themselves as fishermen with informants. (3) Cai Abing, also a direct member of Tai Bao Ashu's gang, fled to the villages bordering Liandang and Yuhui after Shitang Xiaodi's case was solved. It is reported that he was also induced and captured by Wu Xisheng, the captain of the Water Police Detachment of Jiangsu Province, the day before yesterday. From then on, Tai Bao Ashu's gang can be eradicated, and merchants and residents in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area can temporarily rest easy.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Will Soon Reach Yushan</h3>
<p>The track laying project for the Jinyu section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has been completed. Only the Jiangshan-Jiangshan Bridge is difficult to construct due to the contractor, so the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau is hiring workers to rush to build it. Trial runs are expected to be completed by the 15th of this month, and the train will be able to directly reach Yushan from the starting point of crossing the river in Hangzhou on the 20th. The entire line will be open to traffic. However, due to the shortage of locomotives, two more locomotives will be replaced at Jiangbian to Jinhua Station and then attached to Lanyin and Yushan to facilitate transportation. The opening ceremony for the entire line will still be held on the 28th and will not be delayed. The product exhibition along the line will also be held in Jinhua at the same time.</p>
<h3>Hefei Sixth Girls' Middle School Student Wei Wenhua Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Wei Wenhua, a third-year junior high school student at Hefei Sixth Girls' Middle School, was 19 years old. She was diligent in her studies and of good character. However, in recent months, she suddenly became abnormal, sad, and unhappy. Teachers and students at the school did not suspect anything else. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the third day, Wei took advantage of the fact that there was no one at the school on Sunday and committed suicide by drowning in a well. It was not until dusk, when the school servant was drawing water, that she was discovered. The principal, Ye Weizhen, immediately sent someone to pull her out, but she had already died. He sent someone to send a letter to Wei's family in Taoxi Town and reported it to the court for an autopsy. On the fourth day, Wei's father, Wei Dehao, rushed to the scene. Yang Bingzhang, the prosecutor sent by the court, confirmed that she had committed suicide by drowning before death. Wei prepared a coffin for her burial and temporarily placed it outside Deshengmen. According to the school and Wei's father, Wei had no suicide note, but her diary and works showed a suicidal concept, the reason being a marriage problem, restricted by the old family etiquette and unable to be free.</p>

<h3>Local News: Wang Jingwei Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to Invite Central Committee Members to Discuss the Current Situation = Visits Kong Xiangxi and Urges Song Ziwen to Enter Beijing = = Receives Reporters and Issues a Statement, Returning to Beijing That Evening = = The Central Government Has Determined Three Measures to Handle the Fujian Incident =</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Railways, left Beijing on the night express train at 11 o'clock the night before yesterday. He arrived at Nanxiang Station at 7 o'clock yesterday morning and took a car to his private residence on Xipushi Road to rest. At 8:30, he visited Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Finance, on Xiaxian Road. In the afternoon, at the residence of Chu Minyi, he met with Cai Yuanpei, Song Ziwen, Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, and others to exchange opinions on the current situation. At 9:30 in the evening, he received reporters from various newspapers and issued a statement. Then, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, he returned to Beijing on the Shanghai-Nanjing train at 12 o'clock that night. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Visiting Kong Xiangxi to Discuss Finance</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi had been away from Beijing for more than a week. President Wang, considering the recent tension in Fujian, which requires expenses everywhere, after resting slightly after arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, went to Xiaxian Road to visit Kong at around 8:30 to discuss financial issues. He did not leave until around 10 o'clock. As a result of the meeting between Wang and Kong, a solution to the financial problems has been discussed.</p>
<h3>Important Meeting Held at Chu's Residence</h3>
<p>President Wang then invited Cai Yuanpei, Song Ziwen, Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, and other members of the Central Committee to Chu's residence on Albert Road at around 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon to discuss important issues such as handling the Fujian rebellion, convening the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and the progress of the National Economic Committee plan. It was not until evening that the meeting dispersed. At around 10 o'clock in the evening, he received Gu Mengyu and other members of the Central Committee for about an hour. President Wang did not leave Chu's residence until 10:20 and went to the North Station to board the train to return to Beijing with Zeng Zhongming.</p>
<h3>The Mission to Shanghai is to Visit Kong and Song</h3>
<p>Wang met with reporters from various newspapers at Chu Minyi's residence on Albert Road at 9:30 in the evening. Wang first stated that his trip to Shanghai was to take advantage of the weekend holiday to visit Minister Kong and Member Song Ziwen, and other members of the Central Committee. Because Finance Minister Kong had not been to Beijing for many days, various financial matters were pending discussion. The meeting with Song was specifically to discuss the progress of the Economic Committee, and with other members, to exchange opinions on the current situation.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Will Soon Enter Beijing</h3>
<p>Member Song Ziwen has agreed to enter Beijing before the 20th to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Although the domestic finances have been slightly affected by the Fujian incident, thanks to the efforts of Finance Minister Kong, there are now considerable solutions. Administrative expenses should be tightened to help overcome the difficulties.</p>
<h3>No Compromise With Fujian's Alliance With the Communists</h3>
<p>The most painful thing about the Fujian Rebellion is the alliance between the 19th Route Army and the Communists. Last year, the 19th Route Army was transferred to Fujian Province to suppress the Communists, but now they have colluded with the Communist bandits, which is completely contrary to the central government's policy of suppressing the Communists. This makes political compromise impossible. Although Fujian denies allying with the Communists, the facts are all there and cannot be hidden from the eyes and ears of the world. Even if military compromise is possible, but political compromise is not, then Chairman Chiang's years of encirclement and blockade of the bandits will be destroyed in one fell swoop. In fact, Fujian provides the Communist bandits with material assistance, allowing them to revive. The blockaded bandits all use Fujian as an outlet, making it impossible for the central government to achieve final success. Their crime is no different from that of the Communist bandits.</p>
<h3>Three Measures to Resolve the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>The central government has decided on three measures to resolve the Fujian situation: (1) To convey the truth of the matter as fairly as possible to the public, so that the people of the country will fully understand that the Fujian coup's superficial slogan is dissatisfaction with the central government's measures. I am a member of the administrative staff and dare not say that I am satisfied with the current domestic and foreign policies, but everything can be said. If you are dissatisfied with the central government, you can explain it in a legitimate way, but you must not collude with the Communist Party to overthrow the central government. (2) To hope that the 19th Route Army will automatically rise up and correct its rebellious actions, because the only mission of the 19th Route Army in Fujian is to suppress the bandits. Now that they are colluding with the Communist bandits, many within the army are expressing disgust and are eager to wait for the opportunity to return to the right path. (3) To prepare for the dispatch of troops by the central government, that is, to deploy heavy troops on the border of Fujian Province to strictly prevent the rebel army from running amok. As for whether the central government's army will launch an attack on Fujian first in the future, or wait for the Fujian army to invade the north and then strike hard, this is a military action and I am not in a position to express it.</p>
<h3>Hoping That Mr. Hu Will Rise Up to Control Fujian</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Zhantang has always firmly opposed tolerating the Communists. Therefore, he should not only express disapproval of Fujian's alliance with the Communists, but should further assist the central government in jointly planning how to eliminate the Fujian rebellion. On December 11, 1927, a part of Zhang Fakui's troops mutinied and allied with the Communists, occupying Guangzhou. Zhang and Chen Gongbo and others exhausted their efforts for three days and nights to recover Guangdong Province. Zhang's recovery of Guangdong is a small feat, which can slightly redeem his crime of negligence. However, Mr. Hu Zhantang still severely criticized Zhang. Now that Fujian has colluded with the Communist Party to rebel, forming a government and changing the name, its crime is not only negligence. Therefore, I deeply hope that Mr. Hu can rise up and find a way to eliminate it.</p>
<h3>Military Authorities Must Not Leave</h3>
<p>The Southwest previously telegraphed Beijing, requesting the military and political authorities to resign in order to resolve all disputes. However, I believe that the military authorities are devoting themselves to suppressing the bandits, and progress is currently smooth. If the military authorities leave their posts, it would be an opportunity for the Communist bandits. In the past, military and political power was concentrated in one person, but now military and political power are separated. The responsibility for military and political affairs cannot be concentrated in one person. As for myself, I can leave at any time. Although diplomacy and domestic affairs have not been done well in recent years, this is not a problem of people, but a problem of methods. If anyone has a good method, I can definitely step aside and give way. The Central Committee members in the Southwest always proclaim "resistance to the end." However, this is a aspiration, not a method. The people of the country all share this aspiration, but what is needed is a method. Furthermore, with a method, we still need someone willing to take responsibility. If we have a method but are unwilling to take responsibility, to whom will we entrust our responsibility? Therefore, under the condition that there is a method and someone is willing to take responsibility, I can resign at any time and am willing to stay in Beijing to help, even if it is a humble position such as a clerk or scribe. However, the military authorities must not leave.</p>
<h3>The Mission of Zhang and Others Going South</h3>
<p>Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, and other comrades are undertaking two missions on this trip south. First, to urge the members of the Central Committee in the Southwest to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. Second, to discuss solutions for the Fujian rebellion. Since Fujian is allied with the Communists, the Southwest will definitely not ally with Fujian. However, if Fujian can abandon its pro-Communist policies, that would be another matter. Rumors that the Southwest is advocating holding a preparatory meeting for the Fourth Plenary Session in Shanghai are not accurate. If the Southwest makes such a proposal, the Central Government may consider it. In short, judging from past history, we will never borrow foreign power to overthrow the government, or borrow the power of the Communist bandits to overthrow the government.</p>
<h3>Road and Postal Service Not Yet Implemented</h3>
<p>The issue of road and postal service in North China has not been implemented. If it is implemented in the future, it will be done publicly, not secretly. The truth about the treaty between Sheng Shicai, the governor of Xinjiang, and Soviet Russia is unclear and is currently under investigation. If it is true, the Central Government will certainly not recognize it, and Sheng will also be punished, and so on.</p>
<h3>Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Convened a meeting yesterday morning. Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan and Permanent Vice Minister Li Shijia arrived in Shanghai at around 7 a.m. yesterday morning by the Beijing-Shanghai express night train. They immediately took a car to the Navy Headquarters in Gaochang Temple. At 8 a.m., they met with Political Vice Minister and First Fleet Commander Chen Jiliang at the headquarters to discuss the Navy's handling of the Fujian situation. They also convened the commanders of various ships stationed in Shanghai, as well as staff officers and adjutants, to discuss specific measures to blockade the sea mouths of Fujian Province. The meeting adjourned at 3 p.m. As for the results of the meeting, they will not be announced temporarily due to the importance of the matter. After the meeting, Minister Chen and Vice Minister Li left the Navy Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Blockade of Seaports</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound Press met with the new Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan yesterday. According to him, the blockade of the sea mouths of Fujian Province has already been implemented by the torpedo fleet commander Wang Shouting and the commander of the Majiang naval base, Li Mengbin, leading the Yixian and other ships to inspect all incoming and outgoing ships along the coast of Sanduao and other places, in order to prevent Fujian from privately transporting military supplies and food. As for the Xiamen Naval Aviation Office and other agencies, they are still operating as usual and have not been confiscated by Fujian. The local area is still peaceful.</p>
<h3>Naval Losses</h3>
<p>Since Majiang was occupied by the 19th Route Army, the Navy's agencies, such as the Majiang Shipyard, the Naval Academy, the Naval Training Camp, and the Changmen Fort, have all been occupied. Students of the Naval Academy and trainees of the Training Camp have been transferred from Fujian to Beijing for resettlement, so that their studies will not be interrupted. In addition to the documents and important equipment of various agencies being taken away by Commander Li on the Jiangyuan ship, other real estate and all larger machinery have been confiscated, with losses reaching seven million yuan.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Ships</h3>
<p>The coastal ports of Fujian Province include Sanduao, Majiang, Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Xiamen. The Ministry of Navy has dispatched six ships, including the Yixian, Zhongshan, Yongji, Chuguan, Jiangyuan, and Haining, to patrol the sea and inspect ships entering and leaving. As for the three ships stationed at Wusongkou, the Haichou, Ninghai, and Yingrui, they are still under the command of Chen Xunyong, the commander of the training fleet. The ships Funing, Jiangzhen, and Yongjian are patrolling the waters of Xiangshan, Zhejiang. If necessary, Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet, will lead them to set off for the sea mouths of Fujian Province.</p>
<h3>Liu Weizhi Denies Going to Guangdong on Behalf of Jiang, Subsidies for Domestic Coal Must Reduce Costs and Limit Foreign Coal Dumping</h3>
<p>Contract for Steel and Ammonium Sulfate Plants to be Signed Soon. New Sound Press: Reports have stated that Liu Weizhi, Vice Minister of Industry, along with Central Committee member Chen Qingyun, are going to Guangdong on behalf of Chairman Jiang. A reporter from the New Sound Press interviewed Mr. Liu at his residence yesterday morning. Mr. Liu denied this report. The record of the interview is as follows:</p>
<p>Going to Guangdong is Not True. According to Mr. Liu, the report that I and Committee Member Chen are going to Guangdong on behalf of Chairman Jiang is not true. Since the Central Government already has Committee Members Zhang Ji and Wang Luyi, and others going to Guangdong, why would we need to go as well? It has been said that Committee Member Chen (Qingyun) is a representative of Guangdong Chairman Chen Jitang, which is merely speculation. However, Mr. Chen recently went abroad to inspect the aviation industry, so after returning to China, he went to Jiangxi to report to Chairman Jiang. He also went to Hangzhou to visit the aviation school a few days ago. Outside speculation may have arisen from this. I have not been to Jiangxi recently. Since the Fujian Incident occurred, I visited Chairman Jiang once. Chairman Jiang's attitude remains in favor of peace, but because the Fujian side acted rashly and betrayed the party and the country, not only did they abandon the position of the Kuomintang, but they also created hostile actions, so the facts can no longer be resolved peacefully. Now, the Central Government has a tight deployment on the Fujian-Zhejiang border. If Fujian invades the Zhejiang border, they will be given a head-on blow. Otherwise, there may be no military action for the time being.</p>
<p>Subsidies for Domestic Coal. Regarding the measures to subsidize domestic coal, which were originally organized by myself, the Ministry of Industry convened a meeting of coal merchants in Beijing and decided on several principles. The coal merchants' meeting held in Shanghai this time was based on the decisions made after the previous meeting. The coal merchants convened the meeting themselves for further study, and then the Ministry of Industry will convene a general meeting to decide on the subsidy policy. Therefore, the statement that Minister Chen will also attend the meeting today is not accurate. As for the prerequisites for subsidizing domestic coal, the first is to resist the dumping of foreign coal. Currently, the dumping of foreign coal not only yields no profit, but also sells at a loss. Therefore, the principle of subsidies is that the government should make every effort to reduce shipping prices for domestic coal through state-owned railways and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and at the same time reduce taxes and fees for mine operators to lower their costs. For foreign coal, a dumping tax will be levied to prevent its cheap sale. On the coal merchant side, efforts will be made to reduce overhead expenses to lower the cost of coal, such as reducing the salaries of managers and senior staff. Efforts should be made to make the price of domestic coal lower than that of foreign coal, so that it can compete with foreign coal. As for the previously proposed issuance of public bonds to subsidize the coal industry, which was not fundamental, it has been cancelled.</p>
<p>Steel and Ammonium Sulfate Plants. Regarding the steel plant and ammonium sulfate plant being organized by the Ministry of Industry, contracts can be signed soon. Regarding the progress of the steel plant, when negotiating with the German company Gutehoffnungshütte, all the machines in the plant would be supplied by the German company transported to China. The total capital was 60 million yuan in national currency. After the Ministry of Industry notified the German company that the price of each internal component must be listed, experts are now studying and estimating the prices. It will be completed in about a week, and the contract can be signed. The location of the plant will be decided this Wednesday after a meeting convened by the Ministry of Industry and the General Staff in the Beijing General Staff Department. However, preparatory engineering work such as construction may take more than two years before construction can officially begin. The signing of the contract for the ammonium sulfate plant is also approaching. Because the plant is jointly run by domestic merchants, the government, and foreign merchants, when negotiating with foreign merchants, it is still being studied which of the British and American merchants is more beneficial. Once a decision is made, it will be established. It is expected that products can be manufactured in one and a half years.</p>

<h3>Today is the Anniversary of the Guangzhou Uprising</h3>
<p>Special alert throughout the city. National News Agency: Today (11th) is the anniversary of the Communist Guangzhou Uprising. The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hongen, previously received a confidential report that reactionary elements were hiding within the territory, intending to distribute reactionary publications and incite ignorant workers to disrupt order. After receiving the report, Director Wen believed that at this time of winter defense and at a time when the Fujian coup was not yet over, local security was particularly important. Therefore, in addition to ordering the various district teams to implement special alert procedures, the Inspectorate also dispatched multiple inspectors to take turns driving motorcycles to patrol in Nanshi, Zhabei, and other places. After receiving the order, the district chiefs dispatched double posts at various key intersections and streets. They also worked with inspectors and male and female inspectors to search pedestrians. The police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession also dispatched Chinese and Western detectives from each West Patrol to conduct strict patrols within the territory to prevent and curb disturbances.</p>
<h3>Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Bureaus Arbitrarily Issue Business Circulars, The Ministry Orders the Bureau of International Telegraphs to Negotiate</h3>
<p>Establish a commissioner to inspect reporting matters. The Ministry of Communications believes that the Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Bureaus have recently arbitrarily issued business circulars, which is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 3 of the Rules for Receiving and Dispatching Offices. It has ordered the Bureau of International Telegraphs to negotiate and stop this practice. In order to inspect reporting and solicit business, a business inspector has been specially appointed. Details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Company Oversteps Authority, Negotiation to Stop</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications issued an order to the Bureau of International Telegraphs yesterday, stating: It has been found that after the Ministry took over the receiving and dispatching telegraph offices of the Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Companies on January 1 of this year, the companies cannot have any direct contact with the public regarding soliciting business and collecting fees for sending telegrams. This time, the two companies arbitrarily printed and issued business circulars, which is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 3 of the Rules for Receiving and Dispatching Offices. The Bureau should quickly negotiate with the two companies to stop this practice and request them to provide a letter of guarantee that similar actions of overstepping authority will not occur again in the future to avoid disputes. Please comply accordingly and report on the handling situation. This order.</p>
<h3>Establish a Special Bureau to Inspect Reporting</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has specially established business inspectors in domestic telegraph bureaus and stations to inspect services and solicit business.

The results of the handling should be submitted to the Department for record to facilitate promptness. In addition to sending separate letters, please be informed.</p>
<h3>Pudong Telephone Officially Connected Last Night</h3>
<p>New machines tested in the morning to correct sound waves. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications established the Pudong Branch at the end of last month. More than 50 new machines have been installed for users one after another. The branch started testing the new machines with the main line eight hundred power supply units yesterday morning. The results were good, but a few of the door eyes still had sound wave obstructions. The director of the branch, Xu Zhichun, ordered workers to repair them. It was not completely corrected until 4:20 pm. Therefore, it was postponed until 6 pm before users of the new machines were notified to directly communicate with the Chinese Concession.</p>
<h3>Lin Wo Jiang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, Two New Zhejiang Province Aircraft to be Purchased</h3>
<p>Aviation Volunteer Team to be Established. Lin Wo Jiang, Secretary-General of the China Aviation Association, was summoned by the Zhejiang Province authorities to Hangzhou to negotiate the purchase of the Zhejiang Zheng and Zhejiang Xue aircraft. He returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon after completing the official business. According to Mr. Lin, donations for the two aircraft have begun, and they can be purchased within the year. Regarding the organization of the Aviation Volunteer Army, it will be established in Beijing on the 15th day of the first month. The details of his conversation are described below.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Zheng and Zhejiang Xue Aircraft</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Lin, the reason for going to Hangzhou this time was that he was summoned by the Zhejiang Province authorities to negotiate the purchase of the Zhejiang Zheng and Zhejiang Xue aircraft. The Chairman of the Zhejiang Province Government, Lu Dipin, and the heads of various departments had initiated donations to purchase the Zhejiang Zheng aircraft. After discussion at the provincial government meeting, officials from various agencies under the provincial government donated money to purchase it. Therefore, while summoning me to negotiate, they also appointed Zhou Junyan, the head of the Finance Department, to raise donations. I will report the details of the negotiations to the Standing Committee. Also, Chen Bulei, the head of the Zhejiang Province Education Department, initiated donations from various schools in Zhejiang Province to purchase the Zhejiang Xue aircraft, which has also been negotiated. The naming ceremony for the two aircraft will be held in Hangzhou soon.</p>
<h3>Aviation Volunteer Team</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin continued, regarding the organization of the Aviation Volunteer Team, Xu Peigen, the director of the Aviation Department, had talked about it with me when I was in Hangzhou. It has now been decided to hire Gao Zhihang, an instructor at the aviation school, as the captain. Instructor Gao has extensive experience in aviation. He performed an air show when the Shanghai Jiao and other five aircraft were named last time, which was highly praised by the people of Shanghai. As for the establishment ceremony of the volunteer team, it is planned to be held in Beijing on the 15th day of the first month. After the establishment, it will be stationed in the capital. All members of the team will be selected and dispatched by the Aviation Department.</p>
<h3>Aviation School Enrolls New Students</h3>
<p>The Central Aviation School began enrolling flight students this time yesterday. In addition to Hangzhou and Wuhan, the China Aviation Association in this port is also acting as a registration point. A few days ago, the school sent several staff members to Shanghai to handle this matter. Yesterday, the school sent Feng, the head of the medical department, to Shanghai to preside over the event. It is reported that since yesterday, those who went to register have been very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Sino-French Vietnam Treaty Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>Because the French Minister is about to return home. The Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty, after several consultations between French Minister Wilden and our foreign affairs authorities, both sides' opinions are close. Even the tax rate part has been largely decided, and it could have been signed soon. However, because our country is about to levy import taxes on foreign rice and wheat, and Vietnam is a rice-producing area, the French side expressed its desire to postpone the signing. Now that French Minister Wilden is scheduled to return home within days, the signing of the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty will be temporarily shelved.</p>

<h3>National Match Industry Held Annual Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Relief Measures and Request Separate Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Meeting to Continue Today. United Press: The China National Match Industry Association held its second session of the second executive committee in the morning at its association hall on Sichuan Road to address the decline of China's match industry.</p>
<p>More than 20 representatives attended, including Liu Hongsheng, Jiang Shirong, Cai Keming, Gao Songfu, Fei Minbo, Wang Jianqing, Lu Zhaolin, Chen Juru, Xu Zhiyi, Xu Riqin, Zhao Xuanqing, Qu Jiantang, Zhou Ziyuan, Huang Runshu, Zhao Langru, Ji Qingbi, Huang Guanyi, and Xiang Zhengyun.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report. Chairman Liu Hongsheng said, "At this time when the domestic match industry is declining, this association is convening the executive committee to discuss relief measures. I hope that representatives from all provinces will contribute their opinions as much as possible to develop a comprehensive relief policy." Next, each department reported on recent important association affairs, and finally, the accounting situation was reported.</p>
<p>Items for Discussion: (1) The association plans to petition the government to establish a Match Control Committee; (2) Due to the overproduction of domestically made matches, the government should be requested to strictly restrict the establishment of new match factories to protect domestic products; (3) A request to the government to strictly suppress smuggling with effective measures to maintain tax revenue and protect domestically made matches; (4) The association plans to correct the Ministry of Finance's sudden increase in heavy taxes on matches; (5) A proposal to petition the Tax Bureau to revise the new match tax rate appropriately based on mathematical principles; (6) Due to the rapid tax increase, an appeal should be made to the Ministry of Finance to save the situation; (7) A request to reduce the excessive tax increase; (8) A request for exemption from raw material tax; (9) A request to stop the illegal forced collection of business tax in Hankou; (10) A request to send a telegram to Fujian Province demanding the cancellation of the People's Government; (11) A request to the association to discuss the current business difficulties of the industry after the match tax increase and how to seek relief.</p>
<p>Notice to All Factories. Letter No. 3087 of the Ministry of Finance Tax Bureau states: The case of increasing the match tax, which was ordered to be implemented from December 5 of this year, has been telegraphed to you in winter for your information, and I hope that a special telegram will be sent to all manufacturers for their information and action. However, the newly revised method of collecting match consolidated tax is based on the size of the box and the number of matches in each box as the standard for grading and taxation. However, the match boxes are different for each factory, or by manual or by machine. The number of matches in each box varies. In order to handle matters fairly, the number of matches in the existing box should be checked by the resident staff from time to time to ensure accuracy and avoid confusion. For example, after every two match workers pack a box, the resident staff should take out a small box from the total number of the same brand as the basis for checking the hand-packed box, or ten small boxes should be taken out from the total number of machine-packed boxes for each machine per shift as the basis for checking the machine-packed box. If the number of boxes taken out exceeds one hundred, then twenty boxes can be taken out from that number for checking. If the number of boxes taken out is less than one hundred or less than fifty, then fifteen boxes should be taken out from that number for checking. If the number of boxes taken out is less than fifty, then ten boxes should be taken out from that number for checking. This checking procedure is the responsibility of the resident staff in conjunction with the responsible personnel of each factory, and the results of the checking on the same day should be filled in the daily report form, signed and stamped by the resident staff and the factory responsible personnel, and submitted to the competent authority for daily assessment and statistical average to determine whether it meets the level of tax to be levied. This form should also be formulated and distributed by the bureau for use by the factories. As for the matches produced by the factories before the tax increase, if they are indeed stamped and shipped before December 5, they will be allowed to be exempted from supplementary tax to show leniency. If they were made before the 5th, have been stamped, but have not yet been shipped, the old stamps should be removed and replaced with new stamps in accordance with the new tax rate. Matches approved to have a storage inspection list and stored in foreign warehouses should be taxed according to the new tax rate when they are shipped out of the warehouse from the 5th to prevent taking advantage of loopholes and to show fairness. In addition, the tax rate for loose matches has not been revised this time. The collection method should still be temporarily handled according to the old rules. In addition to issuing separate documents, I am sending five copies of the revised match consolidated tax rate table for your reference. I hope that you will forward it to all manufacturers for their information and action. China National Match Industry Association, December 4, 1933.</p>
<p>Continued Meeting Today. The meeting of the association lasted until 9 p.m. yesterday before it ended. However, there were many proposals, and some have not been resolved. Because the time was late, the meeting will continue this morning. All the resolved cases will be published after they have been sorted out.</p>
<h3>Itinerary of Contemporary Figures</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua, Yu Youren, Gan Naiguang, and Li Shijia took the night express train to Beijing at 11 pm last night.</p>
<h3>Cai Shengbai Talks About Rescuing Silk Industry, Emphasis Should Be Placed on Domestic Use, Only One-Fifth of National Silk Production is Exported</h3>
<p>Import Tax Rates on Cloth and Wool Fabrics Must Be Increased. New Press reports that the Ministry of Industry has decided to hold a production meeting in Shanghai next year to discuss the production and sales of domestic goods and to rescue the decline of various industries. Because the sales of domestic silk have declined and the market has plummeted, the reporter inquired about whether the proposal would be discussed at the production meeting and especially visited Mr. Cai Shengbai, the general manager of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory and a member of the preparatory committee of the association, to ask about the silk factory industry and his personal opinions on the relief of domestic silk. The record of his conversation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Two Causes of Decline</h3>
<p>Mr. Cai said that the silk industry in our country has plummeted in recent years. There are two reasons: the unstable domestic political situation, natural disasters, and man-made disasters have followed one after another. In addition, the attacks of the September 18th and January 28th incidents have made the social economy more and more difficult. The people's purchasing power is weak. They still have to consider purchasing cloth and clothing, let alone have the ability to buy silk. This is one. Foreign trade is manipulated and monopolized by Japanese silk merchants, and we have no self-operated silk sales auxiliary agencies abroad. Each bank, warehouse, and ship is easily controlled and manipulated, and the quality is rarely improved. Therefore, it cannot compete with Japanese silk, so the export volume of raw silk has gradually declined. This is the second.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Silk Industry</h3>
<p>At present, there are 187 factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and only 14 or 15 of them can barely make ends meet. The total loss of the silk industry has reached more than 20 million yuan. There are also hundreds of silk reeling factories in Shandong and Sichuan provinces. There are a total of 200 or 30 silk reeling factories in Guangdong, but now almost all of them are closed. Less than one-tenth of them are in operation, and the loss is also more than 20 million yuan. The amount of native silk produced by farmers in other places is even higher than the amount of machine-reeled silk, but now sales have completely stopped, and the loss is in the tens of millions. If no measures are taken to rescue them, they will inevitably go bankrupt. Now, farmers have mostly destroyed mulberry trees and seeds, and there is almost no courage to restore their old business. Even if you gentlemen have great plans and strategies that can revive the sales of the silk industry, there will be no remaining mulberry trees in the mulberry fields at that time, and the silkworm eggs will have withered. Even if you want to continue raising silkworms and producing silk, I am afraid it will not be possible.</p>
<h3>Silk Production and Sales</h3>
<p>Generally, those in the silk industry, observing the decline of the silk trade, focus on exports. Therefore, they have petitioned the government to issue 8 million in silk public bonds for relief, but this has been like a stone sinking into the sea, with no effect. The silk weaving industry is closely related to the silk industry and feels that it too has been declining in recent years. The silk factories that have closed in Shanghai and Hangzhou are too numerous to count. Therefore, they are both seeking to develop themselves and are willing to unite with the silk industry on a single battle line to fight together. Currently, if we want to help the silk industry, the first thing we should do is plan how to ensure that all the silk it produces is sold. According to statistics from various provinces, China produces about 500,000 dan of silk annually. In the previous year, raw silk exports from Shanghai were only over 30,000 qiang, and those from Guangzhou were only over 40,000 dan. Exports from other ports totaled just over 20,000 dan, so the total was only 100,000 dan. The amount sold domestically was 400,000 dan. Therefore, even if all silk exports were stopped, it would only be 100,000 dan. The difficulty lies in dealing with the 400,000 dan sold domestically, which, due to the domestic economic decline, has accumulated in pawnshops, banks, and warehouses, swelling to bursting.</p>
<h3>Export Difficulties</h3>
<p>The first step should be to clear this backlog. Only then can we continue to increase production. However, abroad, due to various reasons, sales, shipping, exchange rates, and warehousing all depend on others. Moreover, the quality is not as good as Japanese silk. To try to dump this backlog abroad is like climbing a tree to catch a fish. Even if the silk industry and the government could put all their efforts into developing exports as the only basis for saving the silk industry, it would inevitably be a futile effort. The effect of the previous issue of 8 million in silk public bonds has already proven this.</p>
<h3>Focus on Domestic Sales</h3>
<p>Therefore, we should quickly seek to restore the original state of domestic silk fabric consumption in order to achieve the goal of relief. Technical improvements are another matter. The only strong enemy of the current stagnation in domestic silk sales is the popularity of imported cloths and woolens. Therefore, on the one hand, the import tax rate on these imported goods should be increased to make them less popular. This would allow domestically produced silk fabrics to be sold in the country without the hindrance of obstacles. Recently, the price of domestic silk has fallen sharply and is not much different from the price of imported cloth. If it is promoted and its obstacles are removed, sales will naturally improve, and the backlog of domestic silk will be easily cleared. In summary, if we want to save the production industry, we must strive for consumption methods. Since domestically produced silk cannot be transported and sold abroad, we should quickly find ways to use it domestically.</p>
<h3>Expanding Uses</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that silk can be used to make silk fabrics, satins, damasks, and gauzes. In addition, we can study how to imitate broadcloth and woolens with pure silk to expand its uses. Japan has already achieved considerable success in this research, but no one in our country has paid attention to it. Even in terms of silk fabrics, satins, damasks, and gauzes, in addition to making clothes, they can also be used to make curtains, tablecloths, bedspreads, chair cushions, and other daily necessities. If we study this further, the uses will be widespread. However, the silk and silk fabric factories are currently anxious day and night, only focusing on managing and allocating finances to save themselves from the immediate crisis and fighting against the environment. They have no spare capacity to plan research methods themselves. Therefore, we can only hope that the government can quickly take the lead in inviting silk and silk fabric merchants and the industrial sector to jointly establish an organization, hire experts, and focus on researching how to consume the 500,000 dan of silk produced each year in order to achieve results. Otherwise, focusing on production without considering how to consume it is not a sound strategy.</p>
<h3>Northeastern National Salvation Army Reports on the Bitter Fighting of the Righteous Army</h3>
<p>Sun Zhaoyang's Arrest and Death Are All Rumors. Zhang Zhichao, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern National Salvation Army, previously entrusted Mr. Huang Baosheng, a ginseng merchant from Beiping, to carry a letter to Zhang Zhendong, the representative stationed in Shanghai, reporting on the recent occupation of various counties by the army and the active attacks on Suihua and disturbances of the Hailun and Hulan lines. A simple map was also attached. A reporter from the Far East News Agency visited Mr. Zhang at his residence yesterday and reported the following:</p>
<h3>Attack on Suihua</h3>
<p>On the night of November 8th, the Japanese army, coming swiftly from Mulan and Bayan with muffled oars, surrounded the Wang Zhenqi and Wang Zhenfang units of our army. Their intention was to wipe out our army in one fell swoop. However, our army discovered them and engaged in a fierce battle, followed by hand-to-hand combat. By dawn on the 9th, our army had recovered the Xiji Factory. Since this attack, the Japanese army has feared us like tigers. For ten days, they have been lying low and recuperating, not daring to move. Our commanders Wang Zhenqi and Wang Chuandao, seeing that the Japanese were discouraged, seized the opportunity and changed course to the left wing on the 20th of last month, ordering 300 men from the Broadsword Team to launch a fierce attack on Suihua in separate routes. There were very few Japanese troops in the county, but there were more puppet troops. At the time of sending the letter, our army still had the upper hand (the letter I received yesterday was sent on the 25th).</p>
<h3>Disturbing the Hailun Line</h3>
<p>While attacking Suihua, our army also ordered Qi Sanjiang to lead his troops from the Xiji Factory to disrupt the Japanese military transportation on the Hailun and Hulan lines, preventing them from connecting and losing contact. This would make it easy for our army to recover Suihua, as Suihua is located in the middle of Hailun and Hulan counties, and its position is very important.</p>
<h3>Changing Numbers</h3>
<p>The Japanese army has suffered repeated major defeats by the righteous army, with countless officers and soldiers killed. The numbers, officer and soldier symbols, and names of the Japanese army have been discovered by the righteous army and reported to the rear, which has been published in the newspapers. The Japanese saw this as a great shame. Now, they have changed all their symbols and numbers so that the righteous army cannot understand their true nature. Most of the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria are newly recruited soldiers. If we announce their defeats, the number of casualties, and their names, the soldiers will be wary and their families in the rear will be uneasy, leading to a loss of morale.</p>
<h3>Throwing Bombs</h3>
<p>In early September, civilian uprisings broke out in Nenjiang, Keshan, Nehe, and Buxi counties. The insurgents all became righteous soldiers. Since then, the Japanese and puppet armies in Harbin have been shocked several times a night. At night, they send puppet troops Li Bingwen and Datou to take turns on night duty. The Japanese army is stationed in the hinterland to prevent the righteous army from surrounding and attacking them. During the day, they send teams of five or three planes to appear everywhere, throwing heavy bombs. Those that explode destroy forests and trees. Those that do not explode cause the people to avoid them. The heaviest of these bombs weighs 500 pounds, and the lightest weighs 200-300 pounds.</p>
<h3>Capturing People</h3>
<p>According to reports, in the past two months, the Japanese army has been capturing our Chinese people in the Harbin area with extreme cruelty. Men in their twenties who are captured have disappeared and their purpose is unknown. Women over the age of sixteen and under the age of thirty are often captured. Young women are often humiliated, and older women sew and wash for them.</p>
<h3>Forcing Harmful Substances</h3>
<p>Not only that, but all our compatriots within the sphere of influence of the Japanese and puppet armies must take opium and red pills. Those who take red pills pay half a Japanese gold yuan every half month, and those who take opium pay two Japanese gold yuan, decreasing by ten cents every half year. In addition, there are various taxes with numerous names, too many to count. This alone shows the Japanese's intentions. They not only want to destroy our country, but also want to exterminate our race. It is truly heartbreaking to say this. If our people do not quickly catch up and recover lost ground as soon as possible, I fear that in five years, we will not even be able to return to today's situation.</p>
<h3>Sun's Troops Fighting Bitterly</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese released a strange message, saying that Sun Zhaoyang was arrested and killed. Bin County is very close to Harbin. The area originally belonged to Sun Zhaoyang's base. Last month, the Japanese army ordered a general attack on Bin County. Sun's troops fought to the death. When their ammunition was exhausted, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat with broadswords. The Japanese and puppet armies were terrified. Soon after, the attacks were halted. Sun sent a staff officer to Harbin disguised to go to Beiping to ask for help. Reports said that Sun Zhaoyang was arrested and Fu Dianchen died in battle. That was about this matter. It is true that Fu Dianchen died in battle, but Sun's arrest is absolutely untrue. Because the troops are all brothers, if Sun leaves the troops or something unexpected happens, the entire army would have scattered. This shows one aspect of the Japanese's ability to fabricate rumors.</p>
<h3>Reserving Troops</h3>
<p>This letter was brought by Mr. Huang, a ginseng merchant, a close friend of Commander Zhang. A simple map was also attached. Mr. Huang hid the letter and map inside a whole frame of deer antlers so that the Japanese could not find them. This letter was sent from Beiping to Shanghai yesterday (the day before yesterday) by express delivery. In addition to the above situation, the letter urged me to implore compatriots in the rear to find a way to help preserve this last remaining anti-Japanese force to be the vanguard for restoring the land and avenging shame in the future.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Factories Held Third Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Find ways to promote the organization of the Silk Control Association. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Factory Trade Associations held their third joint committee meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded below:</p>

Silk factory representatives in attendance: (Shanghai) Ding Chansheng, Fei Danru, Yuan Bingzhang; (Wuxi) Zheng Bingquan.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: The meeting began at 5:00 PM. Chu Huiseng was elected chairman. The President's will was read aloud. Next, the resolutions of the previous meeting were reported, and Shen Huachen reported on the situation of petitioning the National Economic Commission. Jiang Laixian reported on the situation of contacting the government authorities. Then, the discussion began.</p>
<p>Resolutions: (1) To promote the organization of the Silk Industry Control Committee so that it can be established as soon as possible. Resolved: Committee member Shen Huachen is entrusted to ask Mr. Ye Zhuotang to find ways to establish it as soon as possible. (2) If members of the trade have opinions to submit to this joint meeting, they should first submit them to the executive committee of the trade association in their respective regions for revision and submission. They must also be submitted to the joint meeting office three days before the meeting. (3) On the matter of setting the date for the fourth joint meeting, it was resolved that the Shanghai Cotton Mill Trade Association will set the date and convene the meeting after the National Economic Commission's response is received.</p>
<p>Ad Hoc Motions: Shen Huachen proposed ad hoc motions regarding plans to promote sales and methods of trade unity. It was resolved to reserve them so that the committee members can fully consider them and discuss them at the next joint meeting. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Dispute in the Silk and Dyeing Industry Resolved Through Direct Labor-Management Negotiation</h3>
<p>The workers held a general meeting yesterday to express their acceptance. The workers in the silk and dyeing industry in this city went on strike to fight for their original bonuses. The dispute was resolved after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the dispute re-erupted because the trade association overturned the mediation record and changed the bonus method. Pan Jiaming, the leader of the industry, feared that the labor unrest would grow, so he invited all the directors of the labor union office to discuss solutions the day before yesterday. After two rounds of negotiations, it was decided that the old-style products would still be in accordance with the original standards. For new products, the bonus for brocade crepe is 30 cents per bolt, Huajin crepe is 22 cents per bolt, Subi crepe is 21 cents per bolt, and Chong crepe is 21 cents per bolt. The labor side held a members' meeting at the Qu Zhenren Road Public Office at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 300 members from various workshops attended. Wei Yi, the chairman, reported the results of direct negotiations with the management and hoped that the workers would take into consideration the current situation and temporarily accept the results. The workers expressed their agreement, so the dispute has been declared resolved.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Magistrate Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the resignation of County Magistrate Jin, the provincial government appointed Long Tiyao to succeed him as the county magistrate of Baoshan. After being appointed, County Magistrate Long arrived in Baoshan a few days ago to inspect the situation. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, a swearing-in ceremony was held in the auditorium of the county government. More than 100 representatives from all walks of life and representatives from various subordinate agencies attended. Feng Cheng, the Special Administrative Inspector of the Sixth District of the Provincial Government and County Magistrate of Jiading, went to Baoshan to supervise the oath. The meeting and ceremony were held as usual. First, the supervisor delivered an exhortation. Then, the county magistrate took the oath. After that, representatives from the county party headquarters, Liu Mozhen, and guests gave speeches. Finally, Long Tiyang delivered a reply. Then, photos were taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Customs Proclamation: New Signals for Lightships Leaving Their Station</h3>
<p>Implemented from New Year's Day. Customs Maritime Department Proclamation No. 1052: Regarding the Proclamation, the Inspector General of Customs ordered that, in accordance with the 1930 Lisbon Agreement on Uniform Maritime Buoyage and Lighthouse Systems, lightships under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Customs leaving their stations should, starting from January 1, 1934, adopt newly prescribed signals in order to ensure consistency and facilitate navigation. The existing signals are hereby abolished. All regulations regarding the use of newly prescribed signals by lightships leaving their station are listed separately. The Supervisory Engineers Office is instructed to comply. This is hereby proclaimed, and the order is copied below for the information of all foreign and Chinese shipowners. Be informed. Listed below are the items: Article 1: When a lightship leaves its station, either due to being adrift, having its chain broken and drifting, sailing to an anchorage, or sailing to a port, its special lights and signals will not be lit. Article 2: Any special topmark of a lightship leaving its station should be removed if it can be easily disassembled. Article 3: When a lightship leaving its station is sailing, the lights it displays and the sound signals it emits should be the same as other ships. If it is self-propelled by a motor, then it must hang the signals specified in Article 4, Paragraph A or B, during the day, depending on the circumstances. Article 4: When a lightship is adrift, has its chain broken and drifts, or leaves its station, it must hang the following signals separately. A. Signals to be hung by lightships leaving their stations above the Yaogangzui section of the Yangtze River: (1) During the day, hang two red flags on one end of the ship's mast and the International Code of Signals PC flag on the other end, indicating (This ship's position is currently incorrect). (2) At night, if the ship usually emits white lights, then one red light must be hung at each end of the ship's bow and stern. However, if the ship usually emits red or red and white lights, then one white light must be hung at each end of the ship's bow and stern to distinguish them. B. Signals to be hung by lightships leaving their stations along the coast of China: (1) During the day, hang a large black ball at each end of the ship's bow and stern. However, if it is inconvenient to use the above signal due to the ship's situation, or if the signal was originally special to the ship, then change to hanging a red flag for substitution. (2) At night, hang one red light at each end of the ship's bow and stern. In order to be cautious, the following supplementary measures should also be implemented to prevent accidents. (3) During the day, the ship should hang the International Code of Signals PC flag, indicating (This ship's position is currently incorrect). (4) At night, the ship must emit a red and white flare at least once every fifteen minutes, but if the flare cannot be used due to the ship's situation, then change to hanging red and white lights to be conspicuous. December 4, 1933, Supervisory Engineer Xi Liman of the Maritime Department</p>
<h3>Yellow River Disaster Representatives Come to Shanghai to Appeal</h3>
<p>Tian Jianai and Wang Fengduo, representatives of the Yellow River disaster victims in Hebei Province, came to Shanghai to appeal, saying that this year, the Yellow River breached its banks, and Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming counties in Hebei Province were the first to bear the brunt, suffering unprecedentedly severe disasters. According to the current disaster situation, it can be divided into three points: retreated, not retreated, and the mouth of the breach where the water flow is still surging. In the areas where the water has retreated, most of them have turned into deserts, as high as more than ten feet, and at least several feet. The flying sand is barren, and the survivors after the disaster have their livelihoods cut off. This must be appealed for rescue. First, in the areas where the Yellow River water has not retreated, the water is still more than ten feet, eight or nine feet, or three or four feet deep. The mulberry fields have become the sea, completely changing the old look. The disaster victims are displaced and wandering, and if they do not become drowning ghosts, they will become starving corpses. This must be appealed for rescue. Second, although the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association and the Labor Relief Group are now trying their best to block the breach, the water is still turbulent and cannot be cut off. The severe cold season is approaching, and the river will freeze, making it even more difficult. Lacking food, clothing, and shelter, plus the frozen and snowy ground, how can people, who are not wood or stone, endure this? This must be appealed for rescue. Third, although Hebei Province is only three counties, the affected area is equal to more than twenty counties in Shandong, and more than twice that of Henan. The severity of the disaster can be seen from this. This must be appealed for rescue. Fourth, more than 20,000 people and more than 100,000 livestock have drowned in the three counties of Hebei. All of the more than 700,000 surviving victims are destitute and have no means of livelihood. They are survivors of hunger and drowning, crying out for food. If the rescue is delayed, they will inevitably die of freezing and starvation, which is inevitable. Charitable organizations and benevolent people must understand that the disaster area in the three counties is broad and heavy, and there are many disaster victims, which far exceeds that of Shandong and Henan, and is not inferior to them. This must be appealed for rescue. Fifth, more than 80 homes in the three counties that were not washed away have collapsed. The fertile land has become barren, and 40,000 mu of abandoned land have been abandoned. The three major elements of clothing, food, and shelter have indeed been permanently bankrupted. Not only will they not be able to live without rescue now, but there is no hope of recovery without a permanent plan. Now, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association is raising funds to restore the countryside, which is a great kindness and benefit. This is good, but it awaits the future and does not help the present. The Central Yellow River Disaster Relief Association's Disaster Relief Group and the Shanghai Charity Organization, in view of the tragic disaster in the three counties, have vowed to do their best to rescue, but there are so many disaster victims and so little rice. It is difficult to save all the monks, and a cup of water is difficult to put out a cartload of burning wood. It is necessary to awaken Chinese and foreign philanthropists, to jointly open their purses, gather sand into a tower, and collect fur from underarms, which is not enough to save the masses from the catastrophe and revive them. This must be appealed for rescue. Sixth, based on the above six points, in addition to submitting a petition to the competent government authorities, the representatives respectfully ask your newspaper to think of the hungry and drowning survivors in the three counties, declare the disaster situation to awaken the world, and raise up benevolent people to help together, so that the 700,000 disaster victims in the three counties will be grateful for generations to come.</p>
<h3>Ji Sheng Hui's Anhui Province Relief Summary</h3>
<p>The China Ji Sheng Hui, in conjunction with various Shanghai charitable organizations, is handling the relief of the Yellow River flood in Heze County, Shandong Province, and the bandit disaster in Anhui Province, as reported in previous newspapers. Because the disaster victims in Fuyang are urgently awaiting relief, Mr. Zhang Zejun, a local gentry in the county, raised several thousand yuan himself, which is not enough for relief. He asked the Ji Sheng Hui to increase the amount and go to release winter relief. It is said that the association has raised a certain amount of money to add to it, and will send someone to depart soon. However, the disaster situation in Taihe and Yingshang counties, which are adjacent to Fuyang, is also serious. Mr. Zhang Zepu also requested that funds be allocated for relief at the time. The association, due to economic constraints, instructed Mr. Zhang to convey to the gentry in Taihe and Yingshang counties that if they could also raise a certain amount of money to contribute together, it could be released together. Otherwise, only Fuyang County would be released, and Taihe and Yingshang counties would have to be left out.</p>
<h3>Yangzhong People Flee to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Yangzhong County land tax turmoil has been going on for many days, and there is no concrete solution. The people in various parts of the county are in danger and have fled to other places one after another. In recent days, thousands of people have arrived in Shanghai one after another, and the situation is extremely embarrassing. They have gone to the Shanghai Yangzhong Industry and Commerce Association to request relief. Mr. Chen Xiaoshan and other members of the association, seeing that the matter was of great importance, returned to the mainland the day before yesterday to investigate the truth. The district chiefs and others have oppressed the people and the villagers have been displaced, crying bitterly, and there is sufficient evidence. They are preparing to file a complaint with the provincial government. Mr. Chen returned to Shanghai yesterday and reported everything to his fellow villagers in Shanghai, and decided to convene a meeting of all fellow villagers in Shanghai within a few days for a more powerful unity and a more powerful expression.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Services Associations Petition for Investigation into Huang Naishu for Collusion with Chen Mingshu and Chen Fumu</h3>
<h3>They Also Expose Five Counts of Misconduct</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Workers Union and Staff Union submitted a joint petition to the Central Party Headquarters, the Control Yuan, and the Executive Yuan, accusing Huang Naishu, the Director-General of the Post Office, of collaborating with rebels, undermining the postal service, and urgently requesting his dismissal and investigation. The petition stated: "Huang Naishu, the current Director-General of the Post Office, originally came from the postal service ranks as a postal director. In 1930, while serving as a postal director, he applied for retirement due to old age. Huang Naishu, using his power as the Director of the General Affairs Department, changed his original salary of 800 yuan to 700 taels, fraudulently receiving over 7,000 yuan in retirement benefits. In May 1932, Chen Mingshu and Chen Fumu, two rebels, used their influence in the Ministry of Communications to appoint Huang Naishu as the Director-General of the Post Office. Having already received a generous retirement pension, he was reappointed to an important position, enriching himself at public expense, which is extremely despicable. Since taking office, under the direction of the two Chens, he has recklessly implemented policies against the trend, often holding secret meetings in a certain Shanghai group and associating with reactionary elements such as Wang Yaqiao and Hong Dongyi, buying off hoodlums to undermine labor unions and subvert the postal service. His misconduct is evident. We now present several of his egregious actions in postal administration, as follows: First, eliminating dissidents and wasting public funds. Since Huang’s appointment, he has been eager to create his own faction to entrench himself in the post office and pursue his private interests. He has transferred over thirty key personnel in the General Office one after another. Even those who are loyal and upright are not tolerated. For a time, the political situation was chaotic, and people were in a state of anxiety, while public funds were squandered to the tune of nearly 100,000 yuan. Second, appointing cronies and monopolizing the postal service. After eliminating all dissidents, he immediately appointed his cronies to collude and act in concert for personal gain. For example, Cao, the current Deputy Director of the Finance Department, is the Director-General's nephew. Other important positions are occupied by the Director-General's relatives and friends. The intention to appoint cronies and monopolize the postal service is blatantly obvious. Third, arbitrarily flattering foreigners and tarnishing national dignity. The Director-General is inherently inclined to curry favor with foreigners, often favoring foreigners and suppressing Chinese in all matters, leading to an increase in the arrogance of foreign staff, like a rising tide. Previously, under the pretext of handling a certain official matter, he awarded a foreign staff member in the planning department a bonus of 3,000 yuan, setting a precedent that had never been seen before. This is a minor matter. Subsequently, he arbitrarily exempted foreign staff from aviation donations, causing a sharp disparity in the treatment of postal staff. If it is said that there is a difference between Chinese and foreigners, the previous Director-General had already uniformly collected income donations levied by the government. Now the Director-General wants to flatter foreign staff, causing the state's policies to be inconsistent, ridiculed by foreigners, and tarnishing national dignity to the extreme. Fourth, promoting postal unrest and making inappropriate arrangements. Sealing off the postal service in the Northeast, while excluding the South Manchuria Railway, is inappropriate. Forcibly transferring postal workers from the Northeast who entered through the pass, causing them to suffer from the iron heel of the Japanese army, is inappropriate. Disregarding a group of brave and capable young postal workers and blocking their advancement is inappropriate. During the previous postal unrest in Beiping and the recent postal unrest in Hankou, the Director-General did not take advantage of the situation but instead resorted to high-handed measures, creating a crisis for the future is inappropriate. Under the pretext of economic difficulties, he implemented layoffs, arbitrarily dismissing capable personnel, while truly old and incompetent individuals, but with whom he had a good relationship or special relationship, were able to continue to stay in the bureau, is inappropriate. All of these actions have led to widespread dissatisfaction. Recently, the Director-General, taking advantage of the opportunity to attend the Universal Postal Union Congress, suggested to the Ministry to conveniently inspect the postal services of various countries. However, the cost of this inspection would be at least 200,000 yuan. The Director-General, on the one hand, fabricated an unrealistic budget in the hope of not exceeding the amount used by the previous Director-General Liu Shufan for inspecting various countries, in order to obtain the approval of the Ministry. On the other hand, he intended to cover all expenses exceeding the budget under the account of the Postal General Bureau in order to cover up whether the inspection was necessary. The Director-General, disregarding the postal service's economic difficulties, only seeks to spend arbitrarily (during the inspection period, his personal daily allowance would require three gold pounds, and other expenses can be imagined) to satisfy his own selfish desires. The above points are all commonly seen facts. Since the Director-General took office, it has been only a short time, but his misconduct has accumulated, and the impact on the postal service is not insignificant. We are confident that your Ministry (Yuan) will innovate and eliminate malpractices without hesitation. We dare to present the facts and submit this petition, imploring you to examine and verify, and swiftly dismiss the Director-General for investigation in order to maintain discipline and stabilize the people's hearts. We await your orders with trepidation. Sincerely submitted."</p>
<h3>Meeting Minutes of Apartment Owners in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Apartment Owners Association has been actively proceeding since it was approved by the Party and government agencies. Unexpectedly, the French Municipal Council suddenly ordered the Central, Datong, and Xindu apartments to change to collecting hotel taxes, increasing the fees by more than five times. All owners were shocked by this news. The association held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Dahua Apartment on Rue Paul Henry to discuss countermeasures. Attendees included representatives from fourteen companies in the French Concession: Dahua Tao Yongchang, Dacheng Hu Chengzhang, Dayi Yan Chunshan, Xinping Du Wenkui, Kyoto Xia Yunxiang, Huadong Weng Yisheng, Huabei Li Xianting, Dongfang Zhao Guangguo, Tianjin Sang Lutong, Wuling Yang Qinshan, Beijing Liu Tiqing, Central Yang Buzhou, Xindu Weng Pingqi, and Datong Li Shengwu. Tao Yongchang was elected as chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating: "The situation of our three companies being unreasonably changed to collect taxes by the French Municipal Council is clear to everyone and need not be elaborated. However, since this incident occurred, all owners have been panicking. We have requested assistance from the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, and Chairmen Du and Cheng of the association have agreed to find ways to maintain it. However, after many days, not only is there no opinion, but the French Municipal Council's tax office has sent staff to collect the second month's changed tax fee. If this continues, it will be difficult to maintain business. Moreover, our industry is originally an apartment for economic overseas Chinese, which is fundamentally different from hotels. According to the news report on the 2nd of this month, the British Concession Public Works Department has approved the exemption of patrol donations for foreign apartments, which is also to maintain economic overseas Chinese. Now, the French authorities are treating us harshly in reverse. Central Yang Buzhou and others reported the process of being forced to pay donations. Next, the representatives proposed countermeasures: (1) Schedule another representative to inquire about the progress of the negotiations with the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association. (2) If necessary, send another representative to petition the French authorities. (3) If the three apartments' donation fees are still collected according to the change from next month, a decision will be made to suspend payment. (4) All owners are willing to act as a backing for the three apartments, willing to sacrifice everything, and will not stop until the goal is achieved. (5) If necessary, issue a declaration detailing the reasons why donations cannot be increased, hoping to gain the sympathy of all sectors. (6) If necessary, convene a city-wide meeting of owners to hold a large petition and request assistance in negotiations from Party, government, and various organizations. All of the above proposals were passed by unanimous vote. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM."</p>
<h3>The China Technical Cooperation Society is Proceeding with Registration</h3>
<p>The China Technical Cooperation Society was initiated by well-known technical experts in Shanghai, including Pan Zhaobang, Wu Xige, Chen Zhigao, Zhou Xiaoan, Shen Junru, Wu Zhiping, and Pan Songru. Its purpose is to connect professional comrades from all walks of life, divide labor and help each other, in order to promote the development of business and improve technology. It is divided into ten groups: enterprise group, finance group, engineering group, medical group, academic group, art group, accounting group, law group, news group, and electrical chemistry group. The founders of the society held a preparatory meeting today to discuss the progress. They all said that the number of founders has met the legal quorum and should immediately submit an application to the Central Party Headquarters for registration in order to be established as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Huang Chu Jiu's Estate to be Auctioned Today</h3>
<p>Part of Huang Chu Jiu's estate, which Tongde sued to confirm its claim to, has been announced by the Shanghai Second Special District Court for public auction at 9:00 AM today in the Civil Execution Office of the Second Special Court. A total of six real estate properties will be auctioned, one of which is the base leased by Tongde Medical College and its affiliated hospital. It is reported that the college invested its own funds to build two two-story buildings and seventeen bungalows on the land, which were auctioned together by the Second Special Court. The college raised an objection, which the Second Special Court approved to be noted in the auction notice, stating that there is a dispute over the Tongde Medical College's claim lawsuit that has not been resolved. It is also reported that the college has filed a lawsuit to confirm the aforementioned claim.</p>
<h3>News of the Establishment of Jianghai Bank</h3>
<p>Jianghai Bank is jointly established by business tycoons from Shanghai and Chongqing, in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. The promoters have fully subscribed for a capital of 1 million yuan and paid it in full at once. On the 8th, a founding meeting was held at the Shanghai Bankers Association. The shareholders who attended were very enthusiastic and elected thirteen directors, including Zhang Qinbo, Xi Ehang, Yu Zuoting, and Wu Yunzhai, and four supervisors, including Xu Mincai and Li Boan. All are in important positions in the financial community of the two cities, with rich experience and successful careers, which can be predicted. The original name of the bank was Dadong Bank, but after learning that there was a bank with the same name in the north, it was publicly discussed and changed to its current name, which includes the place names of the Yangtze River and Shanghai, and implies the meaning of the Yangtze River flowing into the sea, with profound implications. It is reported that the head office of the bank is located in Shanghai, with a branch office first established in Chongqing. When the business is developed, branches will be successively established in various prosperous commercial ports. It is currently being registered with the Ministry, and the head office will have to open within one or two months.</p>
<h3>Zhengming Bank Founding Meeting</h3>
<p>On the 9th, Zhengming Bank held its founding meeting at the Money Industry Association. Two hundred and fourteen shareholders attended, with three thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight shares. Mao Zhenchu from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau attended the meeting to supervise. Zhu Qinfu was publicly elected as chairman. After the ceremony, the articles of association and other items were read out and passed. Tang Shoumin, Zhou Jingzhi, Zhu Qinfu, Hu Bijiang, Wu Yunzhai, Lin Lanpu, Ren Yian, Jiang Zhonglin, and Chen Xingchu were elected as directors. Liu Jizhi and Chen Guangfu were elected as supervisors by a majority vote. Lin Zhaoting and Zhou Jiyun were elected as supervisors. Wang Lunfu was the next largest vote getter. The supervisors checked the capital and reported that it had been fully received. The meeting adjourned with a bell.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Dental Association is Well Organized</h3>
<p>Since its official establishment on June 18th of this year, the Shanghai Dental Association has been conducting its affairs with extraordinary enthusiasm. In the previous month, it successively received the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters' Directive No. 152 certifying its sound organization and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Registration Certificate No. 44. Therefore, the association is not only the official organization of dentists in Shanghai, but also the pioneer of dental associations in our country. Any dentists from this and other places who wish to read the association's articles of association can attach return postage and request them from the association at No. 611 Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Rental Dispute at Mingde Lane, Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>The rent for the more than fifty houses in Luthe Lane on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, originally owned by the Chinese, has been built for many years. After several rent increases, the rent is no longer uniform. The agent for these houses is the Real Estate Department of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, which suddenly sent letters to all tenants, stating that the rent will be increased by 30% from December 1st of this year. All tenants were alarmed upon hearing this and felt that it was unreasonable to suddenly increase the rent during this period of economic depression. Therefore, the landlord, regardless of everything, resolutely oppressed them. Therefore, the tenants gathered several times and organized the Mingde Lane Branch of the Citizens' Federation, and sent a letter to the landlord requesting that the rent be waived and the status quo be maintained. At the same time, they also requested assistance from the Sixth District Branch of the Municipal Federation. This matter has been going on for more than a month, and the two sides have been deadlocked. It is now reported that the Municipal Federation has sent staff to mediate with the landlord several times. According to the landlord, there are also difficulties. The reason is that the lane has not increased rent for ten years, and now the water supply and land donation have increased significantly, so it is inevitable to increase the rent appropriately. After consultation between representatives of both parties, the tenants also expressed understanding of the landlord's opinion, and the landlord also expressed concessions. It is likely that the two parties will resolve the matter peacefully. The method is that the tenants agree to increase the rent by 10%, but it must be postponed for three months. The landlord said that increasing the rent by 10% is acceptable, but the tenants must pay off the rent in arrears in full, and the deadline will not be extended. Therefore, it is still difficult to resolve. Both parties are currently negotiating a solution, which is expected to be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Thugs Loitered Late at Night and Shot and Wounded a Police Chief</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 PM the night before last, three men wearing long gowns were loitering by the side of the road in the Houjiajiao area, in front of the new municipal government in the central area of Jiangwan. At that time, Shi Wenbin, the police chief of the Shenjiahang police station of the Seventh District and Second Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was patrolling in that area. The police saw that the three men's behavior was suspicious and were about to step forward to conduct a search when the three men noticed and took preemptive action, shooting at Shi with a gun. He was hit in the right leg, fell to the ground in pain, and bled profusely. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the three thugs fled west. Subsequently, police chief Qu Fucheng of the station arrived after hearing the alarm, but the thugs had already disappeared without a trace. He then transported the injured to the Shanghai Public Hospital at the Santai Wharf in Nanshi for treatment. At the same time, the chief of the station, Li Dingzhong, reported the previous information to the Supervision Department of the General Bureau and requested the Director to order all districts and precincts to assist in arresting the escaped murderers and their accomplices and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Xing Zhigang Requests a Ban on Excavating Ancient Tombs</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the head of the Fifth District of Shanghai County, yesterday sent a letter to the Lianghui County Government, stating that excavating tombs and selling coffin bricks in various places in Pudong is a criminal offense and requested that a strict ban be issued to maintain law and order. He said: "The area under my jurisdiction is adjacent to Xingfan Township in the Tenth District under your administration. Currently, there are Jiangbei vagrants colluding with local thugs, dismantling ownerless isolated graves, excavating burial objects, and selling coffin bricks. The remains of the dead are scattered everywhere, and I cannot bear to see it. Although the local directors and guarantors have stopped it, it is ineffective and has spread to various villages, making it difficult to contain. According to previous provincial orders, ancient tombs in various places must be preserved. If the excavation and sale of stolen relics are reported by the local authorities, they should be arrested and questioned. However, the Public Security Bureau and other agencies have not issued a ban, allowing the excavation of ownerless ancient tombs, which is wrong. Therefore, I am sending this letter, imploring you to issue a strict ban and requesting that all public security sub-bureaus and district offices uniformly investigate and strictly prohibit it. If you encounter a tomb that is being excavated, you should report it immediately and send it to the county for investigation in order to maintain law and order and punish the violent. I cannot express my gratitude enough."</p>

<h3>Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Group Holds Great National Propaganda</h3>
<h3>=Scheduled to Depart at the End of Next Month for a Two-Year Tour=</h3>
<h3>=Exhibition in Mongolia and the Northwest Postponed by One Week=</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Group, organized by dozens of graduates of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, has returned to Shanghai after its trip to Mongolia and the Northwest for propaganda. It is currently holding an exhibition of Mongolia and the Northwest at the Wenmiao Park. At the same time, the group believes that although the National Crisis Propaganda has been arduous, it has been limited by economy and talent, and therefore failed to make a large-scale tour of the country. Now that all the members of the group have graduated and have no academic commitments, they plan to hold a great national propaganda that travels through all provinces of the country. The propaganda is scheduled to depart at the end of next month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure Route</p>
<p>This National Crisis Propaganda will travel through all provinces of the country. There are more than a dozen people departing, all of whom are graduates of the Academy of Fine Arts. However, the name of the Academy of Fine Arts will not be used, only the name of the Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Group. The departure route is from Shanghai, taking the Jinghu train to the capital, then taking the Jinpu train to Pingto</p>
<p>Jin, Baotou, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan. Within Sichuan, Chengdu to Chongqing and then to Wuhan, Changsha, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guangdong, etc., and then return to Shanghai, which will take about two years.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>The members of the group are all from poor families, and they have many financial difficulties. To travel around the country, the travel expenses and the expenses of the entire group must be at least 20,000 yuan. Each member of the group has raised one or two hundred yuan for personal expenses. As for the remaining amount, the group will raise it from various directors.</p>
<p>Propaganda Methods</p>
<p>The members of the group are currently preparing for the departure. The propaganda methods are divided into several types, such as posters, cloth paintings, and exhibitions. When they arrive in a densely populated city, they will exhibit and publicize it. At the same time, they will also investigate the current social situation in various places, so that they can sketch along the way. As for the departure date, it must be at the end of next month.</p>
<p>Exhibition Postponed</p>
<p>The Mongolia and Northwest Exhibition currently being held by the group at the Wenmiao Park in this city has been held from the 1st of this month to yesterday. However, the number of viewers has been extremely enthusiastic for several days, and there has been slight rain in the previous days, so some viewers have been hindered by the wind and rain. Therefore, it has been extended for one week from yesterday.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Parricide Breaks Mother's Hand Bone</h3>
<h3>The Murderer Has Been Escorted to the Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Fan Jinfu, a 30-year-old man from Yancheng, came to Shanghai from his hometown with his mother, Fan Xu, last year and lived at No. 130 Miaoqiao Road. He usually pulls rickshaws for a living, and his life is still relatively comfortable. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, a dispute arose because a friend urged Fan to repay a debt. His mother, Fan Xu (a 64-year-old mute), was furious when she found out and rebuked Fan endlessly, even beating him. Unexpectedly, Fan was beastly and used a tool to violently knock his mother, Fan Xu, to the ground, breaking her left wrist bone. Blood flowed like a stream and she lost consciousness. The police officer from Post No. 26 of the Third Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrived at the scene and brought all the witnesses to the station. The chief of the station, Jin Dianyung, interrogated them once. Fan Xu was unable to speak, and the documents were escorted to the local court for handling according to the law.</p>
<h3>Land Ownership Certificate Has Been Mortgaged</h3>
<h3>But Declared Lost Again</h3>
<h3>=Guohuo Bank Sues Mortgagee=</h3>
<h3>=The Civil Part Has Been Judged to be Won=</h3>
<h3>=The Criminal Part Will be Publicly Sentenced on the 16th=</h3>
<p>Before the January 28th Incident, Guohuo Bank accepted a piece of land on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai as collateral. The mortgagor signed the document and paid a mortgage of 20,000 taels of silver. The bank held its land ownership certificate as proof. Suddenly, an old woman, Zhu Tan, led her grandson, Zhu Hongshun, to publish an advertisement in the newspaper stating that the land ownership certificate had been lost. The account name, mu share, and other items were the same as the certificate mortgaged by Guohuo Bank, saying that the certificate was entrusted to Xiangshi Xu Suichu, who lived in the New World Hotel, to obtain a new certificate from the Land Bureau. When the Shanghai War broke out, Xu hurriedly fled from his residence in Zhabei, resulting in the loss. In addition to applying to the Land Bureau for a new certificate, it is hereby stated that if it is found in the future, it will be treated as waste paper. This advertisement was read by Guohuo Bank, because this mortgage had been stored in the warehouse after being mortgaged by the bank, as evidenced by the record of the bank's five supervisors jointly checking the warehouse on New Year's Day last year. The so-called loss during the escape during the war is incomprehensible. It is clear that these people first mortgaged the certificate, and then falsely claimed that it was lost in an attempt to deny the debt responsibility of the 20,000 gold mortgage. Such cunning should not be allowed by law. In addition to Gu, who participated in the mortgage, being on the run, the four men and women, Zhu Wu, Zhu Hongshun, Xu Suichu, and Wang Yigong, who guaranteed the mortgage, were hired by Song Ziliang, the president of Guohuo Bank, to file civil and criminal lawsuits with the First Special District Court. The purpose of the civil claim was to confirm that the plaintiff had a mortgage right, and the criminal aspect was to ask the defendants to be convicted of jointly defrauding money and forging documents. The lawsuit has been going on for a long time. The civil court had already ruled in favor of the plaintiff, and the criminal court had also opened more than ten trials, and had once declared the debate closed. Later, the presiding judge believed that there was still a need for investigation, so he reopened the debate. Xu Suichu, one of the defendants, also filed a counter-accusation of false accusation. Yesterday afternoon, Deng Baosun, the judge of the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, continued the questioning.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle between Police and Bandits at Wusongkou</h3>
<h3>=Seabirds Rob and Kidnap Sand Ships=</h3>
<h3>=Fierce Battle for More Than Three Hours=</h3>
<h3>=Warship Received News to Suppress=</h3>
<h3>=Nine Shipowners Died=</h3>
<p>A large five-masted Shandong sand ship, Jin Yongmao, loaded with a large number of wood and groceries from Shanghai for export, was suddenly passed by a bandit ship on the sea ten miles west of Sheshan at Songkou on the 6th of this month. There were about twenty or so seabirds, fully armed with guns, who immediately boarded the Jin Yongmao and kidnapped the ship and its people. At that time, the ship's accountant, Chuan Zizhong, was released and instructed to report back to Shanghai, request money for redemption, ask for 5,700 foreign dollars, set a deadline of five days, and wait there. If it is not redeemed by the deadline, the ship will be destroyed and the tickets torn up. Chuan Zizhong pretended to agree. After arriving in Song, he reported to the Song Office of the Fourth District of the Water Police. After receiving the report, Sun Baolin, the director of the office, immediately notified Zhang Chentong, the captain of the Junhe patrol ship stationed in the Songjiang River, and led the team to rush to suppress the bandits. At about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the kidnapped sand ship was found on the sea surface near Sheshan. At that time, all the bandits were on the sand ship. Seeing the warship coming, they knew they would be hunted down. The bandits were extremely cunning. First, they ordered the sixteen crew members to stand in a row on the deck, so that the warship could see them, and it would inevitably be difficult to shoot. At that time, the crew members refused to obey and jumped into the sea to escape. Seeing the jumpers, the warship saw that they were all kidnapped crew members and immediately lowered the small cabin plank to rescue them. At that time, Fu Binglian, Zhuang Gongqi, Sun Youxian, Ye Xiuzhan, Ye Xiunan, Zhou Yongyi, and Ye Xiaojiu were rescued. However, Sun Shukang, Sun Fangdong, Chuan Jieyu, Qiao Shuicheng, Sun Shutian, Zhuang Yongxu, and Zhang Tongqi drowned in the sea because they were not familiar with water. Ye Fashong and Qiao Shuiquan, two crew members, were shot and killed on the ship by bandits while escaping. Seeing that there were no more crew members in the sand ship, Captain Zhang immediately ordered to fire a cannon as a warning to observe the situation. Unexpectedly, the bandits were not only not afraid, but also fired back. The two sides fought fiercely for more than three hours. The warship fired a total of fourteen shots, and the sand ship was smashed to pieces and was about to sink. Knowing that it was difficult to escape, the bandits still resisted desperately. Captain Zhang ordered the soldiers to use machine guns to strafe around the ship, killing about ten bandits. The bandits began to collapse and sailed towards the shallow beach. At that time, it was already dark, and the warship was drawing too much water and could not chase after them, so it sailed back to Wusong yesterday morning. At the same time, a team was sent to change to sailing ships to search again. In this battle, the warship's gunner Fei Lan was seriously injured, and seven were slightly injured. The circumstances of Jiang's experience have been reported to his superiors. Plaintiff Song Ziliang personally came to the scene with the Xu and Zuo attorneys. Zhu Tan, one of the defendants, again claimed to be ill and did not attend. The plaintiff's attorney immediately raised the same words and requested the court to question Zhu Hongshun and Xu Suichu separately. Then, he immediately stated that the previous time Zhu Tan came to court and testified about how the land ownership certificate was handed over to Xu Suichu for a new certificate, she said that she had to ask Zhu Hongshun, but Zhu Hongshun was not present at that time. Now, if asked Zhu Hongshun, he cannot give a definite answer, saying that he has to ask his grandmother Zhu Tan, but she is not present today. Such mutual evasion is nothing more than an intention to delay. The only thing to do is to suspend the trial of Zhu Tan's part, and wait until she recovers before questioning her. The parts sued against the rest of the people will be debated first to avoid further delay, etc. The defendant's defense attorney immediately expressed agreement. Then, Song Ziliang stated that Xu Suichu's counterclaim had been accepted, but it was unreasonable. The court then instructed the attorneys of both parties to begin the debate. After both parties completed the debate, they announced that the public trial will be held on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>National Goods Exhibition Vigorously Promoted by the Young Women's Christian Association</h3>
<p>Admission tickets are divided into two types, 50 cents and 20 cents. The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association and the Shanghai Women's Community will hold a National Goods Exhibition at the Yuanmingyuan Road Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association on December 14, 15, and 16. It is said that the exhibits inside the association are not only about the national goods movement, but also contain educational and research qualities everywhere. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will visit and give advice, so that national goods will have more hope for development, and the public will be more willing to adopt them, which is what the association earnestly desires. According to the staff of the association, there are two reasons for selling tickets this time: (1) In recent years, national goods exhibitions have been held all over the country, but checking the customs reports, the huge trade deficit is increasing day by day. The association has carefully studied it and believes that in the past, the visitors may not have been people with a large purchasing power, and those with a large purchasing power may not have bothered to move to such a gathering. Therefore, although there are many national exhibitions, the wealthy people still prefer to use imported goods. Based on this psychology, it is proposed to open a new national goods movement, print admission tickets, and hope that people with general consumption ability will actively participate, open up sales channels for the national goods industry, and consolidate the national foundation. It is believed that those who have the ability to consume will not spare the mere 50 cents and 20 cents entrance fee. (2) The ticket proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be used to subsidize the association's regular expenses in 1934. The association's regular expenses are usually raised from a small number of people in the society every year. Now, from the donation of a small number of people, it has been expanded to a large number of people, so that the association's work will be more supported and easily accomplished, which is a win-win situation. It is believed that it will also gain the sympathy of the visitors.</p>
<h3>Papermaking Raw Materials: Long-Term Storage Method for Yellow Hollyhock</h3>
<p>Chen Diexian's letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce elaborates on the details. Industrial expert Mr. Chen Diexian (Tianxu Wosheng) wrote to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, detailing the long-term storage method of yellow hollyhock, a papermaking raw material, to benefit the price reduction of agricultural products. The original letter is recorded as follows: Sir, I read in the newspaper that your chamber of commerce received an official letter from the Nanhui County government, advising paper mills to purchase domestically produced yellow hollyhock roots. I have disclosed the planting method of hollyhock roots in the 59th issue of the Jilian Huikan. It was in the autumn of last year. At that time, the selling price of seeds was set by Pudong Shichang Seedling Company at no more than one yuan per catty. Most of them had separate seed farmers who, for the sake of selling seeds, used my name to distribute leaflets. I did not know about it. In my original article in the 59th issue, there was a saying to prevent oversupply. This year, seed farmers are competing with each other to sell, and the price per dan has fallen from six or seven yuan to three yuan, so that those who bought early regret it, and those who bought later get the advantage, so they collect enough, mostly filling pits and valleys. Even if the price falls again, there is no place to store it. In paper mills, due to the relationship of working capital and the busy work, it is impossible to purchase one year's worth at one time. They usually use up until February or March of next year, and switch to hemp flowers. But this year, because of the cheap price, they bought more, or they can use it until after the plum rain season. Therefore, the storage method for farmers should be wet storage. Slicing is labor-intensive and may not be necessary. For slicing, just wash it thoroughly and crush it with a wooden mallet, and then it can be stored. Whether it has been dried or not, 4% formalin can be used to achieve the purpose of anti-corrosion, that is, every pound of formalin is mixed with 100 pounds of water. The first key point is that the soil must be washed clean, otherwise, once immersed, the soil will mix into the glue, forming black spots and cannot be used for paper mills. Use a kerosene iron box for each, first press the hollyhock roots firmly, and then inject the formalin solution (the instrument hall calls it formaldehyde, which is based on the chemical name, and its pure product costs 2.5 yuan or 2 yuan per pound; the pharmacy calls it formic aldehyde solution, which is based on the pharmacopoeia name and contains 40% pure product, costing 1 yuan or 80 cents per pound; industrial raw material dealers call it formalin or formoline, which is based on the transliteration of Formolin, each barrel contains four weights, each 112 pounds is one weight, but there is no retail purchase. The utilization plant purchases the original barrel and can be divided into bottles, costing only half a yuan per pound), making sure the liquid is full, and then seal the mouth with solder, but do not vent the gas, it can be stored for two years without deterioration. Generally, one dan of hollyhock roots currently costs three yuan, and the formalin used costs at most four pounds, which is no more than two yuan. Four iron boxes cost about one yuan including welding, totaling six yuan, which can be sold for two yuan a box or seven and a half yuan, four boxes per dan, which is cheaper than using hemp flowers in paper mills, so it can be purchased for many years without having to compete for sale at one time. I respectfully submit this to you, and hope that you will pass it on.</p>
<h3>Hibiscus Competition Held at the Municipal Zoo</h3>
<p>About a hundred hibiscus participated in the competition. The hibiscus competition held by the Municipal Zoo of this city was held at 9:00 am yesterday in the lecture hall of the Confucius Temple Park. Admission tickets were one dime per person, and the audience was very enthusiastic. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Venue Arrangement</h3>

Various bird cages were displayed on the desks, with numbers and names marked on the cages, but the names of the birds were not indicated. The purpose was probably to seek fairness in the judging.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Participation</h3>

More than eighty people have already brought cages to the competition, bringing about a hundred hibiscus of various types. It is expected that more people will continue to come to participate.</p>

<p>The hibiscus competing at the venue include Chinese chrysanthemum tops, English Yorkshire species, Lancaster blood species, snake skin species, Dutch species, German yellow, green, white, and various miscellaneous colors, totaling more than thirty species and more than one hundred birds.

<h3>French Concession: Letter from the Chinese Taxpayers Association to the French Authorities</h3>
<p>Requesting the maintenance of the original tax amount for apartment businesses. The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, upon receiving an official letter from all apartment operators in the French Concession regarding the French Municipal Council's change of tax fees for the Central, Datong, and Xindu apartments, and upon the industry's representatives petitioning the association, detailing the differences between apartments and hotels, specially wrote to the French Municipal Council the day before, requesting the maintenance of the industry's original tax fees and exemption from the change. The original letter stated, Sir, recently, the apartment operators of the French Concession wrote that our fourteen operators have been operating in the French Concession for many years. They have been approved by the supervisor of the French Municipal Council to pay apartment taxes monthly according to the foreign apartment tax rate and issued tax licenses. In June of this year, the Central, Datong, and Xindu apartments moved to Morality Lane on Beile Road due to the renovation of houses on Yule Lane on Avenue Edward VII. They still paid the original taxes. After three months of paying taxes, they suddenly received a notice from the French Municipal Council to pay hotel taxes. At that time, the three apartments were deeply bewildered when they received the order, and they ran around telling each other in the industry. They also did not know whether the aforementioned order to change the license and increase taxes occurred because of the relocation or as a punishment for violating regulations. They did not understand the whole story and did not dare to speculate. However, the three apartments moved from a district of concentrated hotels on Avenue Edward VII to a remote place on Beile Road where there were no hotels. Moreover, they were ordered to change the license and increase taxes three months after the relocation, which was even more confusing. Furthermore, the French Municipal Council also issued an emergency order that water and electricity would be cut off if the hotel tax was not paid, which seemed to be forcing the three apartments to increase taxes. Therefore, they had no choice but to request your association to quickly forward the situation to the French Municipal Council, and earnestly hope that the order to change the Central, Datong, and Xindu apartments to pay hotel taxes, as well as the emergency measure to cut off water and electricity if the hotel tax is not paid, will be cancelled to reassure the businesses. Based on this, we hereby report the situation and request your bureau to investigate the previous reasons and grant the withdrawal of the change tax order. We are extremely grateful for this. This is addressed to Mr. Fardy, Supervisor of the French Municipal Council. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Education News, Sports, Another Act of the Scawta Cup, Western Concession Police Eliminate Qinghua</h3>
<p>Five to One Get a Spot in the Replay</p>
<p>Qinghua and the Western Concession Police played in Hongkou Park yesterday for the second week of the Scawta Cup. As a result, the Western Concession Police won 5-1 and earned a spot in the replay.</p>
<p>▲Western Concession Police Lose First Then Win</p>
<p>Qinghua is young and strong, and their momentum was strong when they took the field. Fu Zhibin opened the scoring, achieving a 1-0 lead. The Western Concession Police were not weak, and they tried to recover. After repeated attacks, Qinghua was caught off guard and allowed Peter and Jack to each score a goal, giving the Western Concession Police a 2-1 lead at halftime.</p>
<p>▲Qinghua Fights Hard But Fails</p>
<p>In the second half, Qinghua was doubly constrained. They united the entire team and worked hard to deal with the situation. Therefore, under pressure, they still launched counterattacks from time to time, unwilling to give up. This kind of enterprising spirit cannot be buried by their failure. The Western Concession Police only scored three goals in the second half, with Xu Peter and Wei Jinsheng each scoring one goal. As a result, the Western Concession Police won 5-1.</p>

<p>The championship of the 19th International Walking Race has once again fallen into the hands of the Chinese team. Since 1928, they have won for the sixth consecutive year. The individual champion is also Cai Zhengyi, a reserve player for the Chinese team. Double happiness is truly gratifying and commendable. Cai's time was 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 15 seconds. It is not easy for a new player on the Chinese team to achieve this result. France came in second, England third, and Italy fourth. Yesterday, the crowd along the way was shoulder to shoulder, and the Yiyuan Garden was particularly packed. When the Chinese athletes entered the stadium, the applause thundered, and the cheers were like a frenzy, extremely enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Cai Zhengyi's Posture When Entering Yiyuan Garden (Photo by Qichang), A Glimpse Along the Way</h3>
<p>▲Started at 8:20 AM</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the sky was overcast, dark, and threatening rain. The morning wind was biting. The area around Kade Road and Jing'an Temple Road was crowded with people, no less than in previous walking races, showing their consistent enthusiasm for walking races. Boy Scouts and police patrolled back and forth, maintaining order. A white cloth banner was hung high across Jing'an Temple Road, stating "December 10th, 8:00 AM, International Walking Race starts here." However, it was not until the roll call and arrangement were completed that the order to start walking was given, already at 8:20 AM.</p>
<p>▲The British Team's Impressive Momentum</p>
<p>A mighty contingent of more than fifty athletes marched straight to Jing'an Temple Road. A police motorcycle led the way. The first person in the lead was Tai Weisi of England, with Xipeng of England one shoulder-width behind him. Passing Jing'an Temple and walking onto Jessfield Road, all the way to Zhaofeng Park, they remained unchanged. Twenty yards behind Xipeng was Falasi of England. In these initial four miles, the three major generals of the British team maintained their position as the top three, with extremely impressive momentum.</p>
<p>▲The Chinese Team Works Hard to Pursue</p>
<p>Crossing the railway, passing Zhoujiaqiao, and reaching Brenan Road, one-third of the journey was complete. The three British generals still led the way, while the four major generals of the Chinese team were not far behind, closely following. Next were Niugebao, Ai Fanlienuo, and Mannandi Li Shou.</p>
<p>[P&gt;Mrs. Little Giving Awards (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)&lt;P]</p>
<p>The champion, Cai Zhengyi, was still hidden in the group behind the leaders.</p>
<p>▲The Situation on Hongqiao Road Changes Abruptly</p>
<p>Brenan Road turns onto Robison Road. In the one and a half miles of Robison Road, it could be noted that Cai Zhengyi accelerated his pace and was already catching up. He rose to eighth place. The leading Xipeng Tai Weisi were overtaken by Falasi. Zhou Ruquan, Niugebao, and Aifan Nuo followed. When Robison Road turned west onto Hongqiao Road, the situation changed dramatically.</p>
<p>▲Cai Zhengyi Has a Smooth Ride</p>
<p>Once on Hongqiao Road, Cai Zhengyi walked faster and faster, leaping to third place, surpassing Aifan Nuo, Xipeng, and Mannandi. A hero's demeanor, if not flying, then soaring to the sky. In the middle section of Hongqiao Road, Cai even overtook the crowd, passing Haig Road and Jiaotong University. Cai had already left Xipeng and others forty or fifty yards behind. Thus, he had a smooth ride, heading straight for Yiyuan Garden, five or six hundred yards ahead of second place.</p>
<p>▲The Chinese Team Wins the Championship Again</p>
<p>The four knights of the Chinese team, Lu Chongyi, Lu Wenxia, Zhou Ruquan, and Zhang Zaojiu, worked together, using quiet effort. They were not discouraged by the momentum of the British team at the start. After the final effort, except for Xipeng, Tai Weisi and Falasi were all left behind in the teens. The good results of the French and Italian teams were beyond expectations. Finally, Mrs. Captain Little gave the awards on the spot in Yiyuan Garden. The Chinese athletes returned with a full load. The British Jin Shi received the silver cup for best posture from Mr. Cheng Yize, for having the best posture.</p>

<h3>Tens of Thousands Watch Baseball Game, Donghua Wins Against Yiling and Ties With Youyou and Jinan</h3>
<p>= Donghua Gets Scawta Cup Replay Qualification =</p>
<p>= Youyou Loses First Then Ties, Resulting in 2 Goals Each =</p>
<p>The famous Shanghai Chinese soccer teams Donghua, Youyou, Jinan, etc., unexpectedly went into battle together at the China Baseball Field yesterday. A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, coupled with the fact that the long-traveling, well-known general Dai Linjing also happened to be called upon to participate at that time, made it the cheapest thing in the world: one ticket, two games. As a result, the baseball field had great luck. Chinese and Western people, young and old, filled the surrounding seats, numbering over ten thousand. The lively scene was almost like the international walking race at Yiyuan Garden in the morning. Donghua and Yiling took the stage first. The outcome of the two teams was self-evident, but Yiling resisted fiercely, keeping people at bay in the first half, causing Donghua to feel disheartened. Finally, Donghua rallied and scored five consecutive goals, ultimately defeating the strong enemy and gaining the right to replay the Scawta Cup. The battle between Jinan and Youyou followed, with both sides combining bravery with flexible footwork, resulting in a clear and watchable game. Each scored two goals, ending peacefully.</p>
<h3>Donghua Overcomes Yiling</h3>
<p>= Result: Five to Zero =</p>
<p>= Victory in the Second Half =</p>
<p>= Changing Formation, Donghua Gains Momentum =</p>
<p>Dai Linjing, after a long absence, still possessed his former splendor. In the first half, his unfamiliar position prevented him from excelling, and the strength of the forwards was greatly reduced. In the second half, he returned to his original position and became unusually active. With the right center forward, they scored five consecutive goals and ultimately achieved victory. Feng Yunyou was absent internally, replaced by Tu. Feng Nianhan was also invited to serve as left forward. This Feng was not as good as the other Feng, and the defense was not solid, allowing the enemy to constantly invade, creating a lot of trouble. Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, and Guan Xun'an were as stable as ever, allowing them to pass safely. In addition to forward Dai Linjing, Wan Xianghua made the greatest contribution, and Chen Hongguang was known for his efforts. Chen Yutian did his best, and Li Qunchen was too cautious.</p>
<h3>Yiling Fails to Capitalize on Early Momentum</h3>
<p>Yiling is a second-rate team from the B group, but their performance that day was surprisingly good. Right winger Folaifeng's sharpness was temporary, entering whenever there was an opening. Center back Bao'ertai was imposing in all directions, with no flaws to attack. Goalkeeper Keluosi was also one of the famous generals of the past, and the five goals lost were not his fault. It was a pity that they did not achieve anything in the first half when they capitalized on their early momentum, and after losing a goal in the second half, their sharpness suddenly declined, unable to recover. Failure was what they deserved, but the situation should not have been like this.</p>
<h3>Brave Li Ning Rejects the Enemy Twice</h3>
<p>As He Chunhui blew the silver whistle, Donghua's warriors gained the right to kick off and immediately launched an attack. After several back-and-forth movements, the supporters of the Yiling team in the west stand shouted and cheered. The forwards were twice as brave. Feng Nianhan left the west gate wide open, and Folaifeng's feet were swift, suddenly breaking into Donghua's palace. Zhou, the iron gate, stood ready to wait, and the situation was quite critical. Fortunately, Li Ning arrived immediately, and with a bang, the ball was out of danger. Soon after, Fafansha intercepted the ball on the kick-off line and handed it to You, who rushed forward. There was no one in Donghua's defense. Li Ning hurriedly turned back and chased after him, returning a shot.</p>
<h3>Good Yiling's Strict Defense</h3>
<p>In an instant, Chen Yutian opened a corner kick, and Tu Kaiyuan could not wait, sweeping his foot across, resulting in a wild ball. Li Yichen made a comeback, shooting again without success. Makkala's army rallied, the wind suddenly changed color, and they immediately crossed Donghua's three passes, raising their feet to knock on the door, accurately and urgently. The Zhou family dealt with it like handling a baby, catching it and sending it out. Folaifeng returned dejectedly after taking a corner kick. Li Yichen crossed the ball with his head, and Dai Linjing moved closer a few steps. Boluoni could not stop it, so he forced a corner kick. Yu Tian opened the kick, having his own plan. Dai Linjing jumped up and headed it, right into Keluosi's hands. Before long, the five tigers of Donghua surrounded the enemy's gate, and the situation was tense. However, after repeated attempts to peek in, they ultimately ended up disappointed, not because Donghua was not strong, but because Yiling's defense was strict.</p>
<h3>Wan Xianghua Stuns All Four Corners</h3>
<p>Forty-five minutes passed like a flash. After the break, they switched positions. Chen Hua made some minor adjustments to the forwards. Dai returned to his center forward position, and Yichen and Chen Hongguang switched positions. The connection suddenly became more skilled. Looking back at the fearless Yiling center backs, all of them showed signs of exhaustion and sweat. After the kick-off, Dai and Yichen galloped side by side. Xianghua found a gap and drilled into it quickly and fiercely. He reached the enemy's low line in no time, copying into the middle. At the thirty-five-yard mark, with a crisp sound, the ball fell like a cannonball from above, cutting through the goalpost and entering, making Tang Yongchun stare in disbelief, unable to refuse it, thus losing a goal.</p>
<h3>Dai Linjing's Divine Power Seen Again</h3>
<p>After Donghua scored a goal, its momentum became even greater. The five forwards showed their fangs and claws, appearing in the enemy's camp as if there were no one there. Bao'ertai guarded the front door, and Keluosi met the wolf at the back door. The situation was what is called twelve points of embarrassment. Tu Kaiyuan transported cannons, and Chen Hongguang made contributions. Dai received the ball, delighted and running. Turning past Bao'ertai, Boluosi greeted him fiercely. Linjing swept across, and the ball shot past Boluosi's feet, flying diagonally into the net, exceptionally cleanly.</p>
<h3>Li Yichen Reaps the Rewards</h3>
<p>At this point, all the gentlemen of Yiling were filled with anger on their faces. Folaifeng's gallop was evident. In this adversity, they were still able to fight like a trapped beast, dribbling behind the defense and crossing the ball. Yigelai was a step late, Zhou Xianyan pounced and caught it. Dai immediately counterattacked with Xianghua, shooting from afar, only to be caught by Keluosi. How long had it been before Donghua's flag was seen flying everywhere in Yiling's city? Wan received the ball and passed it to the middle. Li Yichen caught it and kicked off Lei, failing to hit him. Li showed great generosity, escaping this pass and then attacking with a powerful shot, again achieving success, making it three to zero.</p>
<h3>Five to Zero, Great Success</h3>
<p>Wu Youliang fouled by colliding with someone outside the free-throw line. Bao'ertai shot with force, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Yigelai passed to the right, and Zhou Yongmen showed off his footwork, without any errors. Doctor Tu's sword worked its magic, again flying to the other side. Li Yichen crossed the ball to Dai, who immediately entered the three-way defense. The two guards, Bo and Ga, attacked from both sides, but still could not avoid the injury of the net being broken, as Dai shot it in, which can be said to have been bitter. Zhang Gongjian and his brothers all made great contributions, encouraging themselves and each other, and supporting Yu Tian and Yichen, causing the enemy to be dazzled, and finally they seized a goal, making the score five to zero.</p>

<h3>Jinan and Youyou Tie Game</h3>
<p>=▲Result: Two to Two= =▲The Whole Field Cheers for Peace=</p>
<h3>Achieving a Tie, Equal Strength</h3>
<p>After Donghua's great victory over Yiling, the Youyou and Jinan national armies successively stepped onto the field, lined up in battle, and clashed. Many of the Youyou team members were old Jinan generals. Brothers met, and the atmosphere of the whole field was filled with peace. However, since both sides were cautiously defensive, the performance was not as brilliant as usual. Jinan's Xu Yahui and Youyou's Jiang Shanjing were impressive throughout, earning praise from the entire field. Xi Qiaosheng and Fusheng's wit and spirit created both goals themselves. The result was a two-to-two tie.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhenxiang's Long Shot Scores</h3>
<p>This game was refereed by the Westerner Haimu. After the whistle blew, Jinan took the offensive. Chen Zhenxiang led the three armies, pressing forward in sections. Huang Ruihua repelled one wave, and Zhuang Shihong worked desperately in the eastern suburbs. Wang Nanzhen could not escape this pass, so he passed it into the middle and handed it over to Yahui. Jiang Shanjing came to抢 (qiang) [grab], Yahui passed it back to Zhenxiang. At the forty-yard mark, there was a crisp sound, and the ball fell like a cannonball from above, cutting through the goalpost and going in, making Tang Yongchun stare blankly, unable to refuse it, thus losing a goal.</p>
<h3>Zhou Shaowen Enters the Hall</h3>
<p>Youyou's loss of this goal was unexpected, so they ordered a counterattack. Sun Jinshun and Gu Shangxiang raced for fifty meters. The ball was obtained by Li, who挑 [tiao] [picked] it into the middle and dropped it in front of the goal. Xu Heng was lured out, and Lai勾 [gou] [hooked] back, but to no avail. It was extremely dangerous, but fortunately, Xu Heng turned around and托 [tuo] [propped] it out, containing quite a bit of volleyball rhyme. The fans greatly appreciated it. Deng Hanjie brought out 阿斗 [A Dou] [referring to someone incompetent] and remotely delivered it to Yahui, re-entering Youyou's defense. Jiang Lu困 [kun] [trapped] him, and Zhou Shaowen took advantage of the unpreparedness to打 [da] [hit] in a goal, making it two to zero.</p>
<h3>Xi Qiaosheng Shoots Through the Dragon Gate</h3>
<p>At this time, Jinan's momentum had the feeling of a灵手 [lingshou] [skillful person] in a热 [re] [feverish] state, and Youyou's internal defense was神鬼不安 [shen gui bu an] [uneasy], with a constant danger of漏溃 [lou kui] [collapse]. Fortunately, Jiang Shanjing's大刀阔斧 [da dao kuo fu] [bold and decisive] could still狂杀 [kuang sha] [fiercely kill] for a while. Huang Ruihua抄 [chao] [copied] from the横路 [heng lu] [sideways] to prevent Xu Yahui from前进 [qian jin] [advancing]. Obtaining the ball, he immediately handed it to Jinshun,盤 [pan] [dribbling] over the中线 [zhong xian] [midline]. The back defense was告急 [gao ji] [in urgent need]. Lai Zuorong还踢 [huan ti] [kicked back] not far, and Xi Qiaosheng got it. He奋勇迈进 [fen yong mai jin] [marched bravely],闯 [chuang] [rushing] to the front of the door,力射 [li she] [shot with force] into the goal, forming a two-to-one situation. Before long, the first half also ended.</p>
<h3>Two to Two, Equally Divided</h3>
<p>After the break, the movements of both sides were迟钝 [chi dun] [slow], without thinking of奋遗 [fen wei] [struggling]. The battle through the场中 [chang zhong] [field] for a long time, nothing was收获 [shou huo] [harvested]. Huang Ruihua监控 [jian kong] [monitored] Xu Yahui, and Chen Zhenxiang also used all his strength to看守 [kan shou] [guard] Sun Iron Leg. The main帥 [shuai] [leaders] of both sides could not发挥 [fa hui] [exert] their权威 [quan wei] [authority], so the through made作战 [zuo zhan] [battle] process was精神不多 [jing shen bu duo] [lacking in spirit]. It was not until the last five minutes that Youyou began to竭智殫力 [jie zhi dan li] [exhausted wisdom and effort],倾师 [qing shi] [mobilizing the army] to attack. Xi Qiaosheng got全军 [quan jun] [the entire army] to齐 [qi] [be齐 [qi] [all齊 [qi] [assembled], and got another goal, resulting in a和局 [he ju] [tie].</p>

<h3>Third Public Exhibition Cup, Chinese Team Plans Final Strategy</h3>
<p>▲Emergency Meeting at 5 PM Today</p>
<p>In this year's Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament, due to the strong overall strength and talent of both sides, the fierce battle between South and Ring still resulted in a tie. In the first cycle, the Chinese team scored ten points and the Western team five points. In the second cycle, the Western team scored nine points and the Chinese team six points. However, judging by the overall strength of both sides, our Chinese team is indeed superior. Therefore, in the third cycle on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week, the strategy will be changed to strive for the final victory. A special emergency meeting for all members has been scheduled for 5 PM today at the YMCA Sports Department on Sichuan Road to discuss all matters.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying and Others Request Ball Games to Aid Relief for Yellow River Flood, Letter to the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association for Raising Emergency Relief Funds for the Yellow River Flood, led by Xu Shiying and others, pointed out that with the severe winter approaching, refugees in the disaster area are living outdoors exposed to the elements, truly a human hell. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter today (the 11th) to Wang Zhengting, Chu Minyi, Zhao Jinqing, and other members of the Chinese National Sports Advancement Association, requesting them to organize ball games on a regular basis to help provide relief and save the disaster victims. Excerpts from the original letter are as follows:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Previously, due to the Yellow River breach, the disaster was severe, and the victims were in urgent need of relief. As raising funds was difficult, we repeatedly wrote to you requesting that you preside over a proposal to hold a ball game to help provide relief. Now, with the severe winter approaching, the refugees in the disaster area are living outdoors exposed to the elements, truly a human hell. We once again earnestly request that you promote the benevolence of those who are hungry and drowning, and fulfill the desire to save the country and its people. Please quickly propose and schedule regular events so that collecting even a small amount of relief money can quickly save many disaster victims. We are eagerly awaiting your command. Respectfully submitted, wishing you good health. Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Qu Yingguang, Zheng Hongnian, Tang Hai'an, Huang Qinglan respectfully.</p>
<h3>City No. 1 Stadium, Closing Ceremony of the Small Football Tournament</h3>
<p>▲Continuing to Set the Group Two Championship</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the closing ceremony of the City No. 1 Stadium's small football competition. There were a total of seven games in the morning, including two final matches: (1) In the Xiao You Group, the Infants team faced the Red Cats. The two teams were evenly matched, and after playing until the statutory time, the score was tied at 2-2. In the five-minute overtime, the Infants scored another goal, thus winning the championship. (2) In the Zhuang Ten Industry Group, the Sino-French team faced the Jianhua team. The Sino-French team won 4-2. However, in this match, Jianhua played with fewer players, greatly reducing their strength. The Sino-French team not only had an advantage but also acted rudely and disobeyed the referee, leading to the expulsion of one of their players. Their victory was not honorable. It has been noted that the Sino-French school's football team has always shown great spirit in participating in the association's competitions in the past. However, in this tournament, they repeatedly behaved improperly, which is regrettable. The results of yesterday's matches are listed below:</p>

<h3>French Novelist, De Gopailla Insults Chinese Women, =Female Writer Pan Junying Lodges a Serious Protest= =Mr. De Ridicules Chinese Women Without Discussing Literature=</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) After the French novelist De Gopailla arrived in Beiping, his remarks often involved ridiculing Chinese women. Intellectual women in Beiping expressed their opposition and planned to warn Mr. De. The reporter interviewed Ms. Pan Junying, a writer of the New Romantic School, to inquire about her thoughts on Mr. De's remarks. According to her, De Gopailla's visit to China was not a problem in itself, but his remarks were indeed an insult to Chinese women. De Gopailla said, "My special impression of China is that modern Chinese women are indescribably beautiful, wearing clothes that seem to be plastered on their bodies, and their faces are flat." In fact, French women also wear clothes that are plastered on their bodies. Why does Mr. De only ridicule Chinese women? Chinese women have always valued etiquette and righteousness and cannot allow those who do not know etiquette to make irresponsible remarks. Mr. De also said, "My ideal person is a humorous Chinese woman with Eastern beauty to marry, which can comfort me for a lifetime." This statement is even more absurd. French young people talk about love, and Chinese young people also talk about love. How can one not talk about love but only talk about marriage? As for the "Eastern beauty" aspect, I am afraid that not only Mr. De cannot understand it, but even those who have lived in China for a long time and studied art may not thoroughly understand "Eastern beauty." Mr. De said, "Chinese women in Suzhou are the most beautiful. I listened to Chinese songs in the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, and a Suzhou singer named Xue Yanqin captivated my heart for several days with her graceful demeanor on stage." This is also a belittling of Chinese women. Mr. De has not been traveling in China for long and is already so absurd, actually regarding the singer Xue Yanqin as the representative of Suzhou women and saying that the singer's demeanor is enough to captivate people. May I ask how many Suzhou women Mr. De has seen, and has he ever had long conversations with noble Suzhou women? Chinese women with knowledge deeply know that women are "independent individuals" and are not just knowledgeable in social interactions and do not engage in proper work. Why doesn't Mr. De observe this and slander Chinese women? Mr. De did not mention literature when he came to Beiping, only ridiculed Chinese women. Chinese women believe that Mr. De is just a literary scoundrel, she said.</p>

<h3>First Executive Committee Meeting of the Middle School Federation</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Society) Since the re-election of the Shanghai Municipal Middle School Student Federation in this term, a dispute suddenly occurred during the second executive committee meeting, causing the meeting to be interrupted. The entire venue agreed to wait for the competent authority to resolve the issue.

It is now learned that the Municipal Party Department believes that at this time of tense situation, the federation should strengthen its work. How can it cause disputes on its own? A special order was issued to the federation to declare the previous three executive committee meetings invalid and reallocate duties.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Echoing Sound</h3>
<p>—Nineteen</p>
<p>I don't know which book I read the following story in, but I still remember it. A certain person suffered from a strange disease. This disease was not the kind of epilepsy that would shock people. He could eat, he could excrete, and everything in his life was normal. The only difference was that whenever he said a word, it was as if there was a sound amplifier in his stomach that would repeat the word. He consulted many doctors about this disease, but none of them knew the cause. Later, this person was fortunate enough to meet a famous doctor who said that it was caused by an echoing sound worm in his stomach. The doctor told him to read the names of the medicines listed in the Compendium of Materia Medica one by one every day. If the echoing sound in his stomach was silent when he read a certain medicine, then that medicine was the nemesis of the echoing sound worm and could cure it. The person followed the doctor's advice, and his disease was indeed cured.</p>
<p>We don't need to examine the accuracy of this story. But if you look around, there are now so many "echoing sound worms" in society that they are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges River and cannot be counted. This is something that deserves our astonishment.</p>
<p>When a subordinate sees a superior, if the superior says "east," the subordinate has no choice but to say "east." If the superior says "west," the subordinate has no choice but to say "west." Even if the superior says "feces are fragrant," how dare the subordinate not say "feces are fragrant"? This is one example.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if A has a certain opinion, then B, C, D, and others will definitely rise up and agree with it. If A has a certain opinion, then Chou, Yin, Mao, and others will do the same. If A's opinion fails, then B, C, D, and others will definitely turn around and agree with A. If A's opinion fails, then Chou, Yin, Mao, and others will do the same. This kind of thing is common, isn't it another example?</p>
<p>Now, being obsequious and agreeable has become a prevailing trend in society. This is indeed a symptom of illness. To put it simply, there are too many "echoing sound worms," but I don't know when we will encounter the "nemesis"!</p>
<h3>Two Heads, Four Hands</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw in this newspaper a news item entitled "Two-Headed, Four-Handed Freak." It said that the wife of a Mr. Hong, a villager living near the Hu family residence at the foot of Gaolang Bridge in this city, was seven or eight months pregnant when she suddenly went into labor. However, the fetus in her womb would not descend. Even the old-fashioned midwife present was at a loss and unable to deliver the child. In the end, the family became anxious and had to call two female doctors from a hospital in Hongkou to come and treat her. After examination, they determined it was a difficult birth, especially since the room was narrow and poorly equipped. If surgery were to be performed, it was impossible due to the limited space. Therefore, she was sent to the hospital, where she gave birth to a deformed monster with two heads and four hands, causing great shock to the entire household. The family members all considered it an ominous sign, and the doctors were also surprised to have never seen such a thing before, leading to differing opinions. It is said that this freak is currently on display in a certain hospital in Tilanqiao for physiological research. Recently, there have been reports of "pigs giving birth to elephants," "sheep giving birth to humans," "one birth with three children," and "one birth with five offspring," all born with "strange shapes and appearances." There were also reports of faces divided into "green, red, black, and white" and babies who "could speak as soon as they fell to the ground," all recorded in the newspapers with seemingly concrete details and not fabricated. Isn't this a very strange and rare occurrence?</p>
<p>In Jiading, southeast of the Jiqing Temple outside the South Gate, at Zhoujia Bridge, the wife of a certain farmer also gave birth to a strange child the day before yesterday. It is said that the top of this child's head is not round but flat, and its eyes are on the forehead, rolling around in the skull. The entire family was so frightened that they wanted to run outside. Moreover, this strange child's hands were more than an inch longer than its knees, resembling the appearance of a very noble emperor. Unfortunately, in society, people are usually prejudiced, and no one dares to raise such "deformed freaks." Therefore, as soon as they are born, they are abandoned in the wilderness to avoid people coming to gawk and causing trouble by trampling on the threshold! I don't think that's right.</p>
<p>As for Shanren Bridge, there are several practical examples, all based on interviews with those involved, which have yielded inspiring results. To summarize the main points, the loans for production, such as water-powered sericulture, have benefited farmers the most, with interest rates at most one and three-tenths percent (approximately interest inquiries). The educational achievements are also not bad; the number of students in the 20th year was 155, and in the 21st year, it was 421, an increase of three times. In particular, the repair of the three dams and five sluices is more beneficial for irrigation. Mr. Zhang Yunbo wrote a record of the reconstruction of the five sluices of Mount Qionglong. During the work, "only alcohol money was given, and labor costs were not calculated," so the results were achieved with half the effort. This place has fostered good customs, so Shanren Bridge can truly live up to its name.</p>
<p>The city has become an incurable disease. However, the rural economy is declining, and those who till the land cannot enjoy its benefits. They all yearn for the city and gradually leave the countryside for the city. If we don't create some opportunities for farmers, the city will inevitably collapse along with the countryside. Therefore, improving the countryside is indeed the most urgent task at present. I hope that the domestic bourgeoisie and financial groups will unite and develop the countryside, which is beneficial to both themselves and others. Every time I hear small landowners worrying about low rice prices and rental income not being enough to cover their living expenses, I feel that this is a situation of waiting for death. They should get up and do something.</p>
<p>I admire those who are dedicated to rural improvement, not shirking labor and complaints, and working like reclaiming wasteland. However, I do not agree with their claim that "as long as the farmers have practical benefits, there is no need to publicize it to the outside world." I believe that such a practical and beneficial undertaking should be widely publicized to excite the public and spread these few seeds widely. In ancient times, not to mention "two heads and four hands," even "three heads and eight arms" or "three heads and six arms" were recorded in the "Dharma Garden Pearl Forest," which must have been fictional stories. Yu Shun's two eyes had (double pupils), Xia Yu's two ears had (three perforations), Shang Tang's two arms had (four elbows), Cangjie's head had (four nipples), Zhou Gong's hand was (reversed grip), and Jin Wengong's shoulder had (fused ribs). These were all famous figures in history. Not only in our China, but also in foreign countries, there have been freaks with (two heads and one foot), (four ears and seven fingers), and (three feet and one hand). However, neither in ancient China nor in modern foreign countries, raising such (freaks) does not necessarily indicate anything ominous. Alas! I believe that those who study physiology must be warned to first eliminate superstition and seriously consider raising them. This is not only an act of kindness to save a life, but also a further step that eugenicists should take!</p>
<h3>Shanren Bridge Lives Up to Its Name</h3>
<p>— Yan Ge</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received a letter from the Shanren Bridge Rural Improvement Association office regarding my work on the new village, correcting it by saying that "(it aims to improve rural life and promote rural autonomy, with cooperative farming and sericulture, water conservancy, and other undertakings as the core, and education as a tool to promote them, rather than focusing all efforts on education)." They also sent me a booklet to take to the barren countryside to bring prosperity, so I don't mind being verbose and explaining again.</p>
<p>However, my work said: "(Without a solid educational foundation, even with magnificent and splendid buildings, they will soon collapse)." The so-called buildings, of course, do not simply refer to earthworks but include all spiritual construction. The Improvement Association office has somewhat misunderstood this point, and I would like to clarify it here!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast Army</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Divining Good Fortune Brings Days of Laughter to the Old Man; Eradicating Worries, Old Friends Live Across the Street</p>
<p>Jiang thought that Gui Zhi was infatuated with gentlemen like Gan Erye, so she might be reluctant towards soldiers like Zhao Ziqiang. Now, hearing her tone, she was actually willing to go to the outskirts with Zhao Ziqiang, suggesting that she didn't dislike soldiers that much. So, Wen continued, "As long as you yourselves are willing to do it that way, we will be very happy." Gui Zhi listened to her mother's words and flipped through the pages of a small picture book. How many pages were in the book? She finished flipping through it casually. After finishing, there was nothing to use as a conversation starter, so she put down the book, closed her eyes slightly, pretending to rest, and reached her hand under the pillow to look for a book. She took something out of her hand without thinking and casually held it up to look at. After looking at it, she couldn't help but blush and immediately stuffed it back under the pillow. Although Jiang was sitting across from her, she was half-turned away, and seemed to see Gui Zhi's actions, but also seemed not to see them. Gui Zhi glanced at her mother out of the corner of her eye and tried her best to stuff the thing she took out back under the pillow. Jiang didn't pay attention at first, but seeing Gui Zhi's actions left a mark in her heart. She didn't say anything at the time, but tidied up the room, poured a bowl of hot tea, and sat aside to drink it. After about an hour, from outside the room, through the crack in the door curtain, she glanced inside and saw Gui Zhi half-turned, her eyes huddled together with her eyelashes, making a line, her nose snorting, probably fast asleep. So she quietly walked into the room and gently called out, "Girl." Gui Zhi still snored slightly but didn't respond. Seeing that she didn't answer, Jiang simply walked to the edge of the kang, pressed her hands on the edge, and called out "Gui Zhi" twice towards her face. She seemed to hear it, but also seemed not to hear it, hummed and grunted in her nose, then turned over and fell asleep again. (264)</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Cartoons</h3>
<p>— Qian Yun writes, Su Liang draws</p>
<p>Writing about Real Observations</p>
<p>The law of the jungle, the big fish eat the small fish, is undeniable; but it's hard to believe that the thin must give way to the fat; aren't two, three, or four thin ones enough to resist the power of one fat one?</p>
<p>Leaving aside everything else, in short: if the fat one relies on his fatness to invade the thin one next to him, in people's minds, they should pity the thin one and hope that he can also get fatter is the least they can do.</p>
<p>For example, buying fewer (imported goods) and increasing national power is like nourishing the thin one and speaking out against the unfairness in reality.</p>
<p>The country belongs to the people, so don't think that the thin one can't be nourished, or that the chronically ill don't need a doctor!</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>Talking About Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are composite-petaled plants of the Asteraceae family, with many varieties, available in all seasons, but those that bloom in late autumn and early winter are the most famous. The old "Chrysanthemum Spectrum" says there are as many as 163 varieties. Like the figwort family of paulownia, the teasel family of dipsacus, the nightshade family of tobacco, the honeysuckle family of gourds, and the cucurbit family of melons, all are composite-petaled plants, but each branch has a single flower; chrysanthemums are composite flowers, with countless florets gathered together, appearing as a single flower. Like burdock, crown daisy, dandelion, sunflower, aster, atractylodes, coltsfoot, artemisia, safflower, thistle, wormwood, wild chrysanthemum, cosmos... etc., some can be used as medicine, some for ornamental purposes, all are related to chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>The name of chrysanthemum has been around for a long time. The "Book of Rites, Monthly Ordinances" says: "(In the month of late autumn, chrysanthemums have yellow flowers)." "Er Ya" says: "(Chrysanthemum is written as 鞠, which means exhausted; it means that the flowering season is exhausted here)." In the Warring States period, Qu Ping's "Li Sao" has the line: "(In the morning, I drink the dew from magnolias; in the evening, I eat the fallen petals of autumn chrysanthemums)." In Emperor Wu of Han's "Ode to the Autumn Wind," there is also "(Orchids have beauty, chrysanthemums have fragrance; I miss the beauty but cannot forget!)." Isn't the chrysanthemum valued by the world very early? Later, Tao Yuanming of the Jin Dynasty, in particular, was a confidant of the chrysanthemum, and the value of the chrysanthemum thus increased tenfold. Mr. Tao was obsessed with chrysanthemums and wrote many poems; such as "(Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains; there is true meaning in this, but I have forgotten the words to explain it. Two chrysanthemums can restrain aging)." "(Three paths are overgrown, but pines and chrysanthemums still remain)." In the Tang Dynasty, many poets praised chrysanthemums. Yuan Wei wrote: "(It's not that I particularly love chrysanthemums among the flowers, it's that no flowers bloom after this flower withers)." Du Mu wrote: "(It's hard to find an open-mouthed smile in the mundane world, so one must fill one's head with chrysanthemums before returning home!)." Lu Lun wrote: "(I wish to compare with the three flowers in beauty, and be a hundred times like the hundred herbs in autumn.)" "(Picking golden flowers, how can I fill my sleeves?)". Li Yi'an wrote in a poem: "(The curtain is rolled up by the west wind, the person looks as thin as the yellow chrysanthemum!)." Many Song people also wrote poems praising chrysanthemums. Su Dongpo wrote: "Even when the chrysanthemums are gone, there are still branches that defy the frost." Li Yanping wrote: "(Not ashamed of the pale autumn appearance of the old gardener, there is still the fragrance of late blooming cold flowers.)" Wang Jinggong wrote: "(Evening wind and rain beat the garden, and the scattered chrysanthemums cover the ground with gold.)" Ouyang Yongshu playfully added: "(Autumn flowers are not like spring flowers when they fall, so tell the poet to look carefully)." In addition, at this time, people like Fan Zhineng and Shi Zhengzhi all wrote "Chrysanthemum Spectrum," so it can be seen that chrysanthemums have always had good luck from ancient times to the present.</p>
<p>Why are chrysanthemums loved by people? Originally, they stand tall and bloom alone in the cold, with a simple elegance and a detached spirit. They are the shadow of a noble and refined person, and also the embodiment of a quiet and virtuous woman, how can people not love them! They have red, white, yellow, and purple flowers of various colors. In the bright autumn light, the eastern fence is brightly colored in the evening, standing alone and boasting of their own style. In our chaotic world, aren't chrysanthemums a good companion? Zhou Maoshu said: "(Chrysanthemums are hermits, lotuses are gentlemen, and peonies are the wealthy)." Nowadays, more people like peonies, and although there are many who like chrysanthemums, planting chrysanthemums in prosperous cities and displaying hermits in the marketplace for exhibitions not only makes the yellow flowers wither and lose their color, but also is it what hermits would want?</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are not only for sale and play, but also can be used to treat diseases: Ge Hong's "Baopuzi" says: "(Chrysanthemum juice is used in dan alchemy)." Tao Yinju said: "(White chrysanthemum is effective in treating diseases)." Su Dongpo said: "(The fragrance is harmonious and correct, and the flowers, leaves, roots, and fruits are all longevity medicines)." Palace women in the Han Dynasty picked chrysanthemums and soaked them in wine, and on the ninth day of the ninth month of the following year, they took them out and drank them, calling it "(Chrysanthemum Wine)," believing that it could prolong life. Therefore, the ancients also said: "(Cornelian cherries are the 'evil-repelling old man,' and chrysanthemums are the 'longevity guest.')" Holding wine banquets on the Double Ninth Festival to admire chrysanthemums is all based on this story. Chrysanthemums can also be worn, and although it is said to ward off evil, the elegant fragrance can actually refresh the mind and nourish the spirit. Wang Cijia wrote in a poem: "(A faint fragrance and light chrysanthemums can add [to the mood])." This means that storing chrysanthemums in bags or pillows is very beneficial to people. ("Record of Purifying the Mind": "Gather sweet chrysanthemums in autumn, store them in cloth bags, and use them as pillows to clear the head and eyes and remove evil impurities.")</p>
<p>Many women use "(Chrysanthemum)" as their beautiful name, taking its pure, dignified, and elegant qualities, just like the person. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty, there was a Chrysanthemum Lady in the palace who was good at singing and dancing and had a wonderful sense of rhythm. She was called "(Head of the Chrysanthemum Department)" in the palace, which can be compared to the "Disciples of the Pear Garden" in the Tang Dynasty. Isn't this a good story in "(the history of Chrysanthemums)?"</p>

<h3>The Inappropriateness of Asking About Illnesses and Requesting Medicine</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>The four characters "(Asking about illnesses and requesting medicine)" initially seemed inappropriate and contained a mocking meaning in Chinese society, almost similar to the tone of "(selling fake medicines after speaking of genuine formulas)." However, due to the laziness and disregard for medicine among Chinese people, it has gradually changed from a mocking tone to an habitual fact. As a result, ordinary people often save themselves the trouble of seeing a doctor when they have minor ailments and resort to asking about illnesses and requesting medicine to resolve their suffering. Although there are many cases where they are lucky and the results are good, upon closer examination, it is indeed greatly flawed. Now, I will describe the various methods of asking about illnesses and requesting medicine in detail below.</p>
<p>(1) Describing the symptoms to the seller to buy medicine. Therefore, drugstore clerks become half-doctors.</p>
<p>(2) Patients who have been diagnosed by a doctor are afraid of the trouble of follow-up visits, so they ask someone to describe their condition to the doctor and request a prescription, which is commonly called "(transferring the prescription)."</p>
<p>(3) Recently, some Chinese medicine practitioners have had a whimsical idea and changed the format of transferring prescriptions to treating patients via correspondence and argumentation through postal mail.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to seeking fairy formulas and incense ash from spirit altars and temples, they also obtain a red paper prescription and have it filled at the drugstore to take.</p>
<p>(5) Old medical newspapers specially open a column for arguing and giving prescriptions.</p>
<p>(6) Western medicines flood the market. In addition to ordinary household medicines, pharmaceutical merchants even promote the instructions for medicines that treat serious illnesses to the public and publish publications similar to newly compiled effective formulas. Patients then ask about illnesses and request medicine from the books. Therefore, recently, some people even inject medicine themselves without going through a doctor. Or, after obtaining a preliminary diagnosis from a doctor, they rummage through pharmacies to find treatments.</p>
<p>(7) Medical and pharmaceutical publications in various daily newspapers often have a medical advisory column, which simply prescribes medicines for readers.</p>
<p>(8) A small number of medical and pharmaceutical magazines also have similar methods as mentioned above. Other magazines, such as the "Family Magazine" of a few years ago, have a health advisory section. The current "Coral Magazine" has a "Health Talk" column. All have become institutions for asking about illnesses and requesting medicine.</p>
<p>Among the above items, I dare not speak for the first to sixth items. The original purpose of the seventh and eighth items was not to encourage people to ask about illnesses and request medicine. At the time, it was intended to arouse readers' interest and provide them with some common sense of hygiene, household medicine, ways to seek medical treatment, methods of health preservation, etc. For example, someone is taking a tonic and asks about the duration, dosage, advantages, and disadvantages, or a disease has been diagnosed and they ask about treatment methods, prognosis, etc. Unexpectedly, the reality is not what was discovered. Many letters are sent with questions that are quite different from reality, and even serious symptoms are asked about in newspapers and magazines. Therefore, the doctor in charge of this item is very embarrassed. If he says "(According to the symptoms described in the letter, it is indeed a certain disease. Just buy a certain medicine and take it)," he will be scolded as absurd by experts. If he says "(It seems to be a certain disease, you can try a certain medicine)," he will be scolded as arbitrary by experts. If he says "(The symptoms described in the letter need to be treated by a specialist, please seek medical examination quickly)," he will be scolded as unlearned by the sender. If he says "(The description in the letter is unclear, I dare not guess)," he will disappoint the sender. In short, the more a doctor reads and the longer he practices, the more unwilling he is to answer easily. How can hearing compare to seeing in person? Moreover, in diseases, scarlet fever and measles, rubella, and the fourth type of rash have limited differences in comparative diagnosis, but the medicines used are very different. Malignant tumors and benign tumors have very different outcomes. Gastric cancer, gastric ulcers, and nervous stomach diseases have many similarities. There are dozens of causes of red eyes. Stomach pain is often a matter of life and death. External ulcers can also involve venereal diseases. Skin diseases are even more strange and bizarre. How can patients describe and state all the symptoms? A slight difference can lead to a great mistake, and human life is at stake. How can a doctor dare to write a prescription? However, patients often send letters with questions such as "(XX's right eye has been swollen with a hard lump since suffering from an eye disease last year. It has not healed for a long time. I wonder if there is any way to treat it?)" or "(There is an advertisement in the newspaper for Ma Bao's miraculous cure for dementia. However, Ma Bao is very difficult to obtain. If it is a fake, will it be harmful to take?)" or "(XX has a lump on her breast due to depression. It is as hard as a block and gradually becomes red, swollen, and blistered, and there is often pus and blood. The affected area is about the size of a silver dollar. This symptom has not been effective after being diagnosed and treated by Chinese and Western doctors. May I ask if there is any way to treat it?)" Such questions are simple and vague, and doctors have no way to answer them. Whether the old medical diagnostic method can be resolved by mail or whether it can be treated via correspondence is not my concern. Now, I will first write down the conditions for diagnosing diseases in detail in the new medical method. Readers should know the inappropriateness of asking about illnesses and requesting medicine.</p>
<p>The following is copied from a textbook that must be read by those who are learning to diagnose diseases:</p>
<p>Name, age, occupation, status, date of diagnosis, chief complaint</p>
<p>Everything the patient can answer the doctor.</p>
<p>(1) Hereditary relationship.</p>
<p>(2) Childhood condition. Adult condition (such as everything at the time of a woman's first menstruation).</p>
<p>(3) Usual living conditions and working conditions.</p>
<p>(4) Previous illnesses (such as a woman's confinement or miscarriage).</p>
<p>(5) Current suffering. What symptoms were present before the illness? Speculated cause of the illness.</p>
<p>(6) The first phenomenon noticed at the beginning of the illness (cold, fever, chills, subjective pain, difficulties in movement, etc.).</p>
<p>(7) The course of the illness from the beginning to the present.</p>
<p>(8) When was this illness most severe? Has it lessened or worsened?</p>
<p>(9) What kind of treatment has been done?</p>
<p>(10) Associated relationships. The patient's self-reported important functions, such as sleep, appetite, cough, sputum, urine, stool, etc.</p>
<p>Examination findings (A) General part,</p>
<p>(1) Constitution (height, bone structure, muscles, fat), (2) Attitude (patient prefers to lie on their back or stomach, passive or active). (3) Face,</p>
<p>1. Color (cheeks, lips, conjunctiva, etc.).</p>
<p>2. Nutrition, edema, 3. Expression, 4. Smile and demeanor.</p>
<p>(4) Skin</p>
<p>1. Color, 2. Presence of rashes, edema, scars, sores, 3. Texture (soft or dry), 4. Skin temperature, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Pulse</p>
<p>1. Slow or fast, long or disordered, 2. Characteristics of the arterial tube (straight, tortuous, presence of induration, etc.). 3. Strength of arterial tube pressure. High or low blood pressure, 4. Characteristics of the pulse wave.</p>
<p>(6) Speed and mode of respiration.</p>
<p>(7) Other significant symptoms.</p>
<p>(8) What is the patient suffering from? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Crisis of Lung Disease in China and Today's Urgent Measures (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Wu Zhihui and other elders initiated the Chinese Lung Disease Society. Its starting point was last year, when it followed Mr. Wu and my father to inspect locations in the suburbs of this city for construction purposes. Mr. Wu said that although sanatoriums are a currently needed construction, with the strength of one individual, they can only accommodate a maximum of fifty to one hundred people. With the multitude of lung disease sufferers in our country, it is like a single scoop from the vast ocean. Although your ambition is good, how can you benefit all patients in the world? My father agreed with his words, and therefore widely invited domestic friends and acquaintances to advocate for and establish the association. Its main tasks are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Using popular and easily understood language, print and distribute various publications about lung diseases to all sectors of society. Among the published materials are small booklets such as "Prevention of Lung Diseases," "Treatment of Lung Diseases," "Guidance on Lung Diseases," and "Effective Treatments for Tuberculosis," which are widely disseminated to promote public awareness. At the same time, send circulars to newspapers nationwide regarding various theories about lung diseases and essential prevention knowledge, requesting that they publish them as much as possible to achieve the effect of publicity.</p>
<p>(B) Send circulars to various counties and districts to establish research associations for the prevention of lung diseases. Their work is nothing more than written publicity and lecture publicity. If this is done, personal hygiene, family hygiene, and public hygiene will surely be gradually improved. However, this cannot be achieved overnight. It requires collective effort and accumulation over time to be successful.</p>
<p>(C) Encourage various regions to establish lung disease sanatoriums (see item four for details).</p>
<p>(D) Respond to letters from members or patients from various regions. For inquiries regarding the association's progress or methods of treatment and care for patients, the association will invite experts to answer them, in order to provide some service to society.</p>
<p>In summary, if everyone knows the methods of prevention and proper treatment, they will not be misled by quack doctors and fake medicines.</p>
<p>The above are all urgent measures in the policy of eradicating tuberculosis. Mr. Li Ting'an once proposed merging the two associations in order to concentrate efforts and serve society together, which is something Po deeply admires. Some people believe that a lung disease society must be initiated by experts in order to be effective. In fact, initiating and presiding are different. If it is a lung disease research institute, it is indeed essential that it be presided over by experts, but the difficulty of its establishment has already been described. As for lung disease research associations, enthusiastic people in public health from various regions and villages should be responsible for initiating them. If difficult-to-resolve issues arise, then invite experts to study them, which would not be too late. In summary, establishing research associations for the prevention of lung diseases in various regions is truly an urgent matter. Moreover, it is easy to do, and the results are promising. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will promote it.</p>
<p>(4) Establishing lung disease sanatoriums in various regions. In most cities with a population of over 50,000 in various countries, lung disease sanatoriums have been established. Our country should learn from their methods. Whether they are prepared by local governments, public organizations, or individuals, all are acceptable. However, each hospital should have at least one X-ray machine and equipment for artificial pneumothorax surgery.</p>
<p>The importance of hospitalization for lung disease patients for treatment and meals has the following two important meanings:</p>
<p>1.  Increasing each person's resistance.</p>
<p>2.  Reducing the risk of infection.</p>
<p>Since the Norwegian government announced in 1900 that all lung disease patients must be hospitalized for treatment to avoid environmental harm, thirty years have passed, and the number of deaths has gradually decreased. However, according to its country's investigation of current hospitalized patients, ninety percent are forced by the government. The hospitalization of lung disease patients for treatment is of great importance to the health of individual patients and society. It cannot achieve significant results without the government's power to preside over it. However, our country's finances are exhausted, and all construction is lagging behind, as briefly mentioned earlier. However, the widespread prevalence of lung disease is truly the most serious disease in our country today. How can we sit idly by? Therefore, despite my limited ability, I began preparing to establish the Shanghai Lung Disease Sanatorium seven years ago. Although there has been no shortage of successors, based on national statistics, it is still far from sufficient. It is deeply hoped that enthusiastic comrades will establish more lung disease sanatoriums in various regions, as this is an important policy for eradicating tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(5) Banning fake lung disease medicines that harm patients. It has already been mentioned that the people of our country lack common medical knowledge. Unethical drug merchants and fake medicines are therefore thriving. Although these medicines may not directly harm patients, they delay the timing of treatment, causing them to lose their lives. Although there are no clear statistics, given the large number of patients in our country and their lack of knowledge, the harm caused by fake medicines is unbearable to speak of. Therefore, local health authorities should carefully chemically test all kinds of lung disease medicines, distinguish between the fake and inferior ones, and make clear announcements. This will greatly benefit patients. This has been done in various countries for a long time. It is hoped that the authorities in our country will quickly catch up. This would be fortunate indeed.</p>

<h3>What are the Dangers of Chronic Gonorrhea?</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Although most people know that chronic gonorrhea is difficult to treat, they do not know what the dangers of chronic gonorrhea are. They often let it go without treatment. If they knew the following dangers, I think everyone would definitely seek treatment early.</p>
<p>(1) Acute Recurrence. People think that after the acute symptoms of gonorrhea have passed, everything will be fine from then on, and there is no danger. This is a very wrong concept. Originally, after the gonorrhea is not completely cured, even if you never visit prostitutes, the latent gonorrhea bacteria can still acutely flare up. This is called recurrence.</p>
<p>(2) Appearance of Acute Complications. Latent gonorrhea bacteria in the urethra not only damage the urethra, but can also attack at any time, invading nearby and distant organs. For example, if it invades the testicles, it can cause acute orchitis; if it metastasizes to the joints and heart, it can cause acute arthritis and carditis, which are all very painful and dangerous.</p>
<p>(3) Formation of Strictures. When the urethra is affected by gonorrhea bacteria, the soft mucous membrane forms hard scars. The contraction of the scars causes urethral strictures. The result of urethral strictures is that the patient cannot urinate, which can lead to uremia, bladder rupture, peritonitis, and other dangerous conditions.</p>
<p>(4) Risk of Infection to the Partner. A happy and healthy family is already suffering greatly because one party is affected by gonorrhea bacteria. On the one hand, they also have to infect an innocent beloved wife, causing her great pain as well. A happy and healthy family is thus broken, filled with an atmosphere of sorrow and gloom. I know that only those who have suffered such pain can understand my words.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge of Diseases Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(20) Bronchopneumonia</p>
<p>(Q) What is bronchopneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) It is a disease in which the lobules of the lung are attacked by pathogens, causing inflammation.</p>
<p>(Q) In what part of the lungs does this inflammation mostly occur?</p>
<p>(A) Most often in the posterior lower part of the lungs.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the causes of bronchopneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) There are many causes. Some are secondary to various diseases, such as acute or chronic bronchitis, typhoid fever, measles, pertussis, epidemic influenza, and scarlet fever. Some are caused by foreign body aspiration.</p>
<p>(Q) Which age group is most affected?</p>
<p>(A) Children and the elderly are most affected.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the initial symptoms of bronchopneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) First, a feeling of coldness, then fever; but the fever pattern is not fixed, mostly remittent.</p>
<p>(Q) What happens later?</p>
<p>(A) Later, severe coughing occurs, expelling a large amount of phlegm, which is purulent. (It may contain blood, but it is not rust-colored.) The patient's breathing is rapid, and they breathe through their nostrils (commonly known as "fanning the nose").</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any changes in the sound during percussion of the affected area?</p>
<p>(A) The affected area sounds dull during percussion.</p>
<p>(Q) What changes are heard during auscultation?</p>
<p>(A) There are weak breath sounds, crackles, and characteristic resonant rales, bronchial sounds, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) If an X-ray is taken of the lungs, what phenomena are seen?</p>
<p>(A) Irregular shadows are seen on both sides, scattered in various locations.</p>
<p>(Q) Bronchopneumonia sometimes presents with specific patterns. What are they like?</p>
<p>(A) There are three specific types: aspiration pneumonia, hypostatic congestion pneumonia, and linear pneumonia.</p>
<p>(Q) How does aspiration pneumonia occur?</p>
<p>(A) Aspiration pneumonia is caused by foreign body aspiration into the trachea, so it is also called aspiration pneumonia. (Such as inhaling food during a coma or anesthesia, or newborns inhaling amniotic fluid and spitting it back into the lungs).</p>
<p>(Q) How does hypostatic congestion pneumonia occur? What are the symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) It is caused by aging, paralysis, surgery, etc. The patient's breathing accelerates, and they often exhibit cyanosis. During the first respiratory movement, fine crackles are heard. It may not be accompanied by fever.</p>
<p>(Q) What is linear pneumonia like?</p>
<p>(A) Because the disease consists of numerous small lesions in the lung that merge and become very large, extending upwards along the spine. Percussion reveals a linear dull sound, hence the name.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the prognosis of bronchopneumonia?</p>
<p>(A) It depends on the age. The younger the age, the more dangerous it is. Also, if the fever is too high, breathing is accelerated, the face is pale, and the consciousness is confused, the prognosis is poor. Bronchopneumonia secondary to pertussis and measles is often fatal.</p>
<p>(Q) How is bronchopneumonia treated?</p>
<p>(A) Because it is secondary to other diseases, the primary disease must be considered first. The most important thing is to use cardiac stimulants, especially camphor preparations and digitalis preparations, which are very effective. Keep the patient resting in bed, administer expectorants internally, and inject quinine preparations. If there is difficulty breathing, administer oxygen inhalation, and warm compresses with mustard plasters, wet cloths, and anti-inflammatory clay pastes can all be used on the chest.</p>
<h3>Casual Chats After Diagnosis</h3>
<p>— Zhang Senyu</p>
<p>Last time, I talked with readers about some lifestyle methods for improving malnutrition, and dietary nutrition methods to improve nutrition and strengthen the body. Although I explained it briefly, it is essential to know how to refine good food inside the body. This is done by a mysterious machine installed inside the body, which undertakes this work. Let's talk about it a little.</p>
<p>(1) This machine is what is called the digestive system. Its structure is described separately below.</p>
<p>(1) The mouth is the head end of the digestive system. It is composed of two pieces of epidermis, muscles, and mucous membranes that form the lips, which can open and close, and can hold food. It can also absorb liquid food, such as milk, soup, etc., through internal movements. Inside there is a cavity called the oral cavity. The outer wall is made up of the cheeks, which also have three layers: outer skin, muscles, and mucous membranes. The edge of the upper jaw has a row of teeth, sixteen in total, of various types. They are arranged in a horseshoe shape, opening inward. The gums are also covered with a mucous membrane, and the upper jaw in the middle is covered with a wrinkled mucous membrane. The front is called the hard palate, and the back is called the soft palate, which extends to the front upper part of the pharyngeal cavity. A muscle covered by a mucous membrane hangs down, called the uvula. The edge of the lower jaw also has a row of inverted teeth, sixteen in total, arranged like the teeth in the upper row. The gums are covered with a mucous membrane. In the middle is the bottom of the oral cavity, which is also covered with a mucous membrane. A tongue covered with a muscle hangs in the center. Behind the root of the tongue is a cavity called the pharyngeal cavity. Except for the muscles and mucous membranes connecting the upper and lower jaws to form the upper, lower, left, and right walls in front, an uvula hangs down above, and a tonsil-shaped object is embedded on each side, called the tonsil. The middle is empty, connecting the nasopharyngeal cavity above. There is a tube on each side, leading into the ear. Below the root of the tongue in front is the Adam's apple. There is a spoon-shaped cartilage cap called the epiglottis. When swallowing food, it covers the Adam's apple to prevent it from accidentally entering. Below the Adam's apple in the back, it connects to the esophagus. The back of the cavity is called the posterior pharyngeal wall, which has muscles covered with a mucous membrane. There are many muscles around this cavity, which move simultaneously with the muscles of the neck, allowing food to be swallowed. There are many glands of various sizes at the bottom and on both sides of the oral cavity, secreting saliva to moisten the mucous membrane and lubricate dry food. There are also digestive enzymes, which help with digestion. More importantly, they reduce the oxidation reaction in the stomach.</p>
<p>(2) Esophagus. This is a twenty-five-cun long muscular tube. The outside is wrapped in a tough outer membrane, and the inside is covered with a layer of mucous membrane that secretes mucus and lubricates it. The tube starts from the posterior wall of the Adam's apple to the upper opening of the stomach, i.e., the cardia. It passes through the middle of the left and right lungs, i.e., the mediastinum. It has a certain curvature and passes through the muscular membrane separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities, i.e., the diaphragm, to the abdominal cavity, and then connects to the stomach.</p>
<p>(3) Stomach. This organ is a hollow sac shaped like a cow's horn. The outside has a tough outer membrane. The middle has two layers of muscles, horizontal and longitudinal. The inside is covered with a layer of mucous membrane, which secretes mucus to moisten the food. The gastric glands also secrete gastric juice to digest the proteins in the food, loosening the undigested materials. The cardia, where the esophagus connects, has a sphincter that controls opening and closing. The bottom expands and slopes down to the left side of the sternum. It gradually narrows and lies horizontally inside the pit of the stomach. It then curves in the abdomen below the small lobe of the liver on the right side. There is also a sac-like outlet called the pylorus, which is also controlled by a circular sphincter. It connects to the upper end of the duodenum.</p>
<p>(4) Small intestine. The intestinal tube is about six meters and fifty centimeters long. The upper end starts from the pylorus of the stomach, and the lower end stops at the ileocecal valve of the colon. It is wrapped in a tough outer skin. The middle is a smooth muscle layer, and the inside is covered with a mucous membrane, which secretes mucus to lubricate it. There are villous protrusions to expand the absorption area of the intestine. There are various types of glandular openings distributed in the middle. There are many in the small intestine and few in the large intestine. There are also two types of openings in the duodenum. One is from the pancreatic duct, and the other is from the gallbladder. Lymph nodes are also distributed on the surface of the mucous membrane. The small intestine is divided into three segments.</p>
<p>The first intestinal segment is called the duodenum. The tube is about thirty centimeters long and four to six centimeters in diameter. It is curved in the shape of a horseshoe. On the right abdominal side, below the small lobe of the liver, the upper segment connects to the pylorus of the stomach. The descending segment curves and turns towards the center. The lower segment runs horizontally behind the stomach and behind the colon, curving towards the upper left to connect to the upper end of the jejunum. The liver is on the upper right side. A gallbladder is attached to the back below between the large and small lobes of the liver. A tube leading out from inside the liver connects to a tube leading out from the gallbladder. The tubes merge into one tube, which leads into the mucous membrane of the intestine. The opening of the tube can be opened and closed. There is also a pancreas embedded in the round bend of the duodenum. It also has a tube leading into the mucous membrane. The opening of the tube can also be opened and closed. Both tubes secrete digestive juice, which digests various materials in the food.</p>
<p>The second intestinal segment is called the jejunum. The tube is about three meters and seventy-two centimeters long and about three centimeters in diameter. The upper end connects to the lower end of the duodenum on the upper left side of the abdomen, behind the transverse colon. It folds to the right side and runs horizontally in the center of the abdomen on a line parallel to the navel. The diameter of the lower end is about five centimeters. It connects to the upper end of the ileum.</p>
<p>The third intestinal segment is called the ileum. The tube is about two meters and forty-eight centimeters long. It connects to the jejunum. It runs vertically and horizontally in the lower part of the abdomen inside the navel, revolving around the bladder above. In women, it is above the uterus. The lower end connects to the inside of the cecum on the lower right side of the abdomen above the pelvic bone, called the ileocecal valve. The tube diameter is narrow.</p>
<p>(5) Large intestine. The tube is about one meter and fifty centimeters long in total. The upper end starts below the ileocecal valve, and the lower end ends at the anus. It is also wrapped in a tough outer skin. The middle is a smooth muscle layer, and the inside is covered with a mucous membrane. The mucous membrane lubricates it. The time for storing fecal residue is very long. It is divided into five segments.</p>
<p>The first intestinal segment is called the cecum. It is shaped like a cone. The pointed part slopes towards the center and behind it below. On the lower outer right side of the abdomen inside, it rests on the groove on the inner side of the serosal part of the iliac bone of the pelvis. This segment of the intestinal tube is extremely short. The upper end connects to the upper segment of the ascending colon above the ileocecal valve. The lower end hangs a thin, long tube. The tube diameter is narrow. The opening has a valve that separates it from the cecum.</p>
<p>The second intestinal segment is called the vermiform appendix. The length and thickness of this tube vary. It is about six or eight centimeters long, or even up to twenty centimeters. The upper end connects to the pointed end of the cecum. The lower end hangs inside the abdomen, but it mostly curves upwards. The tube opening communicates with the cecum. The lower opening is blind. This appendix has nothing to do with digestion. Moreover, it can endanger human life, which is what is called appendicitis. This disease occurs in this appendix, not in the cecum.</p>
<p>The third intestinal segment is called the colon. The tube is about one meter long. The outside seems to have grooves drawn in squares. The inside has gourd-shaped hollow knots, which are connected segment by segment. It is also composed of a tough outer membrane, a middle layer of smooth muscle, and a mucous membrane. There is mucus lubricating it inside. There are small lymph nodes on the mucous membrane. According to the direction it travels, it is divided into three segments.</p>
<p>(Zi) The ascending segment starts from the area of the cecum connected on the outer right side of the abdomen and goes upwards. The front rests on the front abdominal wall in the back. The outer side rests on the outer right side of the abdomen. The inner side rests on the small intestine. The back rests on the front of the quadratus lumborum muscle. It folds and turns towards the center at the lower end of the right kidney and connects to the transverse segment.</p>
<p>(Chou) The transverse segment bends forward from the ascending segment. It passes below the large liver lobe, slightly depressed downwards. It runs horizontally from the right to the left, passes below the stomach, and bends into the ribs on the lower left side of the chest. It then turns to the back in front of the waist muscles and rests on the outer side of the left waist and connects to the descending segment.</p>
<p>(Yin) The descending segment bends repeatedly from the outer side of the left waist to the lower side of the left waist. It rests on the outer left side of the abdomen and descends. It folds forward to the right in the pelvic bone and connects to the upper end of the sigmoid colon.</p>
<p>The fourth intestinal segment is called the sigmoid colon. The tube shape is like the letter B. It hangs down to the back from the area where the descending colon connects to the inside of the small pelvis. Then it bends and turns straight upwards to the body's central section and bends and turns to connect to the rectum. The tissue of this segment of the colon is the same as that of the colon. However, there are no very obvious knots.</p>
<p>The fifth intestinal segment is called the rectum. The tube is about eighteen to twenty-five centimeters long. The diameter is about half to one centimeter. The end segment is larger, called the ampulla. The tissue of the intestinal tube is the same as that of the colon. The lower segment is smoother. It connects to the arching end of the sigmoid colon at the position of the third sacral bone. It runs slightly obliquely forward and downwards to the inside of the anus.</p>
<p>(6) The anus is the end port of the digestive system. There are knots and bundles of venous tubes on the mucous membrane. The muscle layer has an internal sphincter and an external sphincter, which form internal and external constrictions, like a door with two layers, to control opening and closing. There are folds when tightened.</p>
<p>There are blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels, and lymph nodes everywhere in the human body, so the digestive system also has them. The front of the abdomen and the area near the intestinal tubes have a peritoneum, which forms a sac with a little mucus lubricating it, to facilitate movement. The front of the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity is covered with a mesentery, which wraps the intestinal tubes. The blood vessels and nerves that travel inside pass through the middle. There are also ligaments that hook each part. A thick layer of omentum is also laid in front of the stomach, liver, and intestines to protect them. People with large abdomens have a much thicker omentum. The digestive system's own nutrition is supplied by red arterial tubes. Waste is transported to the appropriate place by purple return vessels (called venous tubes) and then discharged from the body. Nerves control the movement of the tube. The secretion function is in the glands or on the mucous membrane. Lymph fluid is also transported within the lymph nodes or tubes to nourish or prevent the invasion of toxic substances.</p>

<h3>On Criticism</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>It is not easy to be a critic.</p>
<p>Even if you want to scold someone in your heart, you still have to bring some good intentions in your mouth, because if you don't, it is destroying culture, and criticism that destroys culture is not allowed. It is said that the past mistakes were in this.</p>
<p>There were indeed mistakes. Although scolding people is not necessarily brilliant, it is rare to demand a quick and straightforward approach, seizing flaws and scolding them severely. The past mistake was in holding a sharp knife, wanting to stab people, but ultimately failing to hit the vitals. As a result, the blade tip was pressed randomly. Even without understanding the meaning of the original text, they actually carried the only principles and justice of (gentlemen) and blew their horns to criticize people. This can naturally be considered criticism.</p>
<p>As for making rumors, slandering, instigating, and framing, although they are not within the scope of criticism, some people still use this as their only weapon, inserting it into critical articles to achieve their gloating selfishness.</p>
<p>And this can also be regarded as criticism.</p>
<p>So (the group of writers) raised objections. They believe that criticism should not point out shortcomings, so even textual flaws should not be corrected, and severe scolding is even more strictly prohibited. As a result, there was a chorus of praise in the literary world, overflowing with joy.</p>
<p>It is said that this kind of criticism is considered healthy and sufficient to help the development of culture.</p>
<p>But I am afraid that it is not necessarily so. Because this kind of joy has indeed overflowed in the past. There is always a set of talents in a literary and art group: poets, novelists, critics; agreeing to take the stage, beating their own gongs and drums, singing their own operas, cheering for themselves, and praising each other, which is not necessarily a chorus of praise. But it is difficult to believe that this is helpful for the development of culture.</p>
<p>And now we are going to repeat this set.</p>
<p>And in the future, it will be developed even further. A prosperous age must use literary rule (ancient wisdom); once criticized, it becomes a brilliant article, which (has precedents in the past).</p>
<p>(Han Feizi's Outer Reserves) There was a man from Ying who sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Yan, writing at night, and the fire was dim, so he said to the candle holder: (Raise the candle!). But he mistakenly wrote "raise the candle." Raising the candle was not the intention of the writing. The Prime Minister of Yan received the letter and was pleased with it, saying: (Raising the candle means respecting brightness. Respecting brightness means promoting the worthy and entrusting them.) The Prime Minister of Yan told the King, and the King was very happy.</p>
<p>This can indeed make culture develop, and even overflow with joy. These oversensitive critics often emerge in response to the times. Today, they have probably descended to earth again.</p>
<h3>Spring Plowing</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Spring has arrived, and it's time for plowing.</p>
<p>In the village, groups of people are spreading manure in the fields, plowing the land, sowing seeds, busy as in previous years.</p>
<p>Farmers must dedicate themselves to the fields in the spring.</p>
<p>But strangely, Old Wang is different from others; he doesn't go to the fields to work, but sits at home pondering – he can't decide how to plant this year's crops.</p>
<p>The facts are clearly laid out: the harvest was good the year before last, but the grain didn't fetch a high price; the harvest was bad last year, and the rent couldn't be paid in full. All year round, he poured all his strength into the fields, rarely resting during the day, only at night, and all he got was not enough to eat. If this continues for another year or two, he's afraid he'll starve to death!</p>
<p>(If you can't pay the rent again next year, don't even think about planting my land!)</p>
<p>Thinking of the landlord's stern words when demanding the rent arrears at the end of last year, he is even more worried about the tragedy at the end of this year. If he really can't pay the rent again this year, his days of being kicked out are not far off.</p>
<p>Then the only solution is to work harder and add more fertilizer to cultivate the land this year, perhaps as a last-ditch effort.</p>
<p>But can this remedy really be achieved? There is only one son at home; how much harder can they work! Besides, which year wasn't work intensified, which year didn't they try their best to fertilize the land! It's just that the lack of money, unable to hire people, unable to buy materials, affects the harvest. No, on second thought: even if the harvest is good, not being able to sell it for a good price is still the same! He feels that these are unlucky years for farmers, with changes every year, making farmers poorer year by year.</p>
<p>(Dad, what are we planting in the south field this year?)</p>
<p>Just at this moment, his son walked into the house, and he,</p>
<p>Not having taken the sowing issue to heart at all, naturally couldn't answer, and could only casually reply:</p>
<p>(Let me think about it tonight and then decide.)</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his indecisiveness was seen through by his son, who then asked:</p>
<p>(Dad, you look listless, unlike previous springs.)</p>
<p>Hearing this question truly saddened him. He then thought: if it weren't for these changing times, the two of them, father and son, would have been farming for six or seven years, and even with bad luck, they could have found a wife. How could a young man of twenty-five or six still be single!</p>
<p>He didn't answer his son's question, just kept thinking and thinking: Farming – selling labor – good harvest but unable to sell for a good price – poor harvest and unable to pay the rent – are farmers just waiting to starve to death?</p>
<p>But in this chaotic and aimless thinking, he suddenly remembered what happened to Old Zhang last year. Last year, most of the tenant farmers in the village owed some rent, unable to pay in full, but only Old Zhang made a fortune. How did he make a fortune? Why? Did he work harder than others, or use more fertilizer? No, not at all, it was just one thing that saved him!</p>
<p>That thing was growing opium! Growing opium used to be illegal, but he heard that after the change (Manchukuo), it was no longer prohibited, and you could plant it however you wanted.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the problem that had been weighing on his mind and couldn't be solved was like finding a good solution, making him say in his heart:</p>
<p>(I'll give it a try too).</p>
<p>It wasn't just thinking in his heart; it had practically become a decision. He believed that only by doing that could he solve future difficulties! This way, not only would a year's labor not be wasted, but he could even make a small fortune. Therefore, he smiled and answered his son's question:</p>
<p>(We're planting opium in the south field this year!)</p>
<p>Saying that with all his might, he immediately stood up, felt for his cane behind the door, and left the house, heading straight for Old Zhang's house. On the way, some people greeted him, but he neither saw nor heard them. His entire spirit was focused on the (growing opium) issue.</p>
<h3>On (Realistic Understanding) and (Artistic Expression)</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>— In Response to Mr. Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>I don't think this needs to be stated, my short essay (Realistic Understanding) was not written entirely to (oppose) Mr. Xu Maoyong's opinions. However, because I remembered that Mr. Xu had said such things, I mentioned it in passing, which led Mr. Xu to express his opinions more clearly and also raise questions for discussion, which I am very happy about. However, our opinions are still fundamentally in conflict. For example, Mr. Xu said: (I believe that for a writer, a correct understanding of reality is more important than a correct artistic expression). But for me, there is no distinction in importance between a correct understanding of reality and a correct artistic expression, because in art, without a correct artistic expression, there would be no correct understanding of reality. Art, as a whole, does not allow people to speak partially. For the sake of clarity of concepts, we can say that the construction of art goes through steps such as realistic understanding and artistic expression, but from a completed work of art, if you want to extract which part belongs to realistic understanding and which part belongs to artistic expression, it will be impossible. This is like a color, although it is mixed from two pigments, but once it is blended, you still want to indicate which part is a certain pigment, it is equally impossible, but we can say that the proportion of mixed pigments can produce different colors. Therefore, Mr. Xu's analogy - (Having a correct understanding but no correct expression is like carving a swan that doesn't resemble a swan but looks like a duck; having an incorrect understanding but great artistic skill, the failure is like painting a tiger that doesn't resemble a tiger but looks like a dog) - is inappropriate. His meaning seems to be that what determines art is that there is something that has nothing to do with art that exists first. He forgets the principle that this reality is the reality expressed in art. Perhaps our views on the term (artistic expression) are fundamentally different. The reason why Mr. Xu regards (artistic expression) as a secondary position in art, I think, is that he interprets the meaning of this term as the final technique in artistic production, while I regard it as including everything besides the backbone of thought, such as conception, scenery, selection of events, character's personality and actions or interweaving, and the concrete expression of thought. Therefore, what I call realistic understanding is only rational objective understanding. Although occasionally, the part of understanding is obtained from concrete realistic events, in any case, it cannot be moved to art without the slightest deformation. If someone does not recognize the law of artistic deformation of reality, then Mr. Xu's saying (a correct understanding of reality is more important than a correct artistic expression) is indeed beyond dispute. Speaking of this point, although I dare not be arrogant and say like Mr. Xu himself that he (holds on to a common sense), but it is probably undeniable that he has neglected the laws of art. Based on the above premises, let's observe the examples of Sanin and Bazarov; according to Mr. Xu's opinion, because Sanin did not exist socially, Arzibashev could not write him truthfully, and because Bazarov already had his (prototype) in reality, Turgenev was able to create him into a typical historical figure. This way of observing the characters in artistic works is just like reading (Dream of the Red Chamber) in the past, seeing Daiyu die and Baoyu become a monk, and then hating Baochai and Fengjie, having been completely deceived by the author and losing the ability to distinguish objectively. After reading (Sanin), one searches through the pages of history to see if there is such a Sanin - a member of the intellectual class who hasn't read a page of books in years, who lectures on a superhuman theory of sexual desire in the midst of his uncle's heartbreak, and then immediately embraces and kisses her passionately, snatches a whip from the officer's hand of his lover and beats him until he is ashamed and commits suicide, and jumps off the train because he hates human faces to take a breath of fresh air - wouldn't that be a bit ridiculous? If you look at it in the same way, Bazarov in (Fathers and Sons) cannot be said to (exist socially), and I'm afraid that even the typical figures known as the two representatives of mankind, Don Quixote and Hamlet, will become the fruits of the artist's imagination. Therefore, the question is not whether Sanin and Bazarov existed socially, but whether Sanin and Bazarov, as expressed in artistic works, have the possibility of existing socially. It is not because Sanin did not exist socially that he is called a fantasy character, nor is it because Bazarov existed socially that he is called a typical character. It is wrong to judge whether or not a character exists socially without considering the laws of deformation or symbolism of artistic characters. Because you will not see examples of social existence in individuals like Sanin, individuals like Bazarov, or individuals of all artistic works. I repeat, art is not such a mechanical thing.

<h3>The Two Brothers (55)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Indeed, she had such fits often afterwards, almost every day, and each time it seemed to be provoked by a word from Pierre, as if he understood the secret of her strange, inexplicable malady. He spied on the traces of intermittent rest on her face, and with the cunning of an executioner, with a single word, he awakened her temporary tranquil pain.</p>
<p>And he was suffering as much as she was! He was in extraordinary pain because he no longer loved her, no longer respected her, yet he had to torment her. Each time after he had teased the bloody wound that he had cut open in this woman and mother's heart as much as possible, when he felt that she was extremely miserable and desperate, he would go out alone and wander the streets, tormented by remorse, struck by compassion. He was annoyed that he had trampled her to such a point with his son's contempt, and he simply wanted to jump into the sea and drown himself to end this matter.</p>
<p>Ah! How willing he was to forgive her! But he couldn't, because he couldn't forget. If he could only stop making her suffer, that would be great; but he couldn't do that either, because he himself was always suffering. When he went back to eat, he was full of moving resolution. Then, as soon as he saw her, as soon as he saw her eyes, which used to be so upright, pure, but now had become fearful, frantic, and afraid to see people, he couldn't help but strike. He couldn't hold back the words that came to his lips that contradicted his own resolution.</p>
<p>The disreputable secret that only the two of them knew thoroughly urged him and her to oppose each other. It was simply a kind of poison flowing in his veins now, and this poison made him want to bite like a mad dog.</p>
<p>Now there was nothing to prevent him from constantly tearing her apart, because Jean now lived almost entirely in his new house. He only returned to his family every night for dinner and sleep.</p>
<p>He often saw some harsh and violent places in his brother, and he thought this was due to jealousy. He promised himself to keep him in his place, and one day he would teach him a lesson, because with such constant noise, the family couldn't live a day in peace. But because he now lived separately, he didn't feel as painful about this kind of rude behavior as before; and his desire for peace made him tend to be patient. And wealth had fascinated him, and his thoughts only fell on things that had a direct interest to him. His mind was full of new and subtle worries, even focusing specifically on the tailoring of a jacket, the style of a felt hat, the size of a business card, etc. He spoke endlessly about the trivial matters in his new shop. He talked about the wooden panels in the cabinets in his room for storing shirts, the coat racks in the hallway, and the electric bells installed to prevent others from sneaking in, etc.</p>

<h3>Special Issue on Drainage, Published Every Monday, Issue 52 The Current State and Future of Finance, Wei Qi</h3>
<p>In recent years, the changes, growth, and decline in the domestic politics of various countries have almost all centered on financial issues. Finance and various aspects of the national economy, such as production, consumption, finance, and prices, have an inseparable close relationship. Therefore, the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, and the mutual coordination with the national economy, can not only stabilize politics, but also directly promote the development of the national economy and indirectly lead to social prosperity. Conversely, it will inevitably lead to political unrest, and even the total collapse of the entire society. Therefore, the rulers of various countries, especially in the current process of increasingly deepening global economic panic, are doing their best to cope with financial problems. In contrast, since the founding of the Republic of China, we have relied on foreign debt to survive, and then used domestic debt as a supplement. We have never considered the formulation of financial policies, the establishment of national budgets, or the adoption of any doctrines in theory. Even the financial measures taken by the National Government after it established its capital in Nanjing and unified the country, in addition to creating many new taxes, such as wheat flour tax, sugar tax, match tax, kerosene tax, etc., still rely on public bonds and treasury bills. Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, the total amount of various domestic public bonds issued by the National Government has exceeded 110 million yuan, and the so-called construction cotton and wheat loans are not included. According to the report of the Ministry of Finance, the percentage of borrowing in the total annual expenditure of the national treasury is as follows:</p>
<p>Accounting Year (ending June 30 each year) Total Expenditure Total Borrowing Percentage</p>
<p>17th Year (from July of the 17th year to June of the 18th year) 434,000,000 80,000,000 18.4</p>
<p>18th Year (from July of the 18th year to June of the 19th year) 539,000,000 101,000,000 18.7</p>
<p>19th Year (from July of the 19th year to June of the 20th year) 714,000,000 217,000,000 30.4</p>
<p>20th Year (from July of the 20th year to June of the 11th year) 683,000,000 130,000,000 19.4</p>
<p>From this, we can see the important position of borrowing in the government's financial expenditure. However, every time a public bond is issued, the government must increase a portion of the burden of repaying principal and interest, thereby increasing a portion of expenditure; every time the government increases a portion of expenditure, it must issue another public bond; rolling around, it is bound to use all the income of the national treasury as the fund for public bonds and then stop. The larger the amount of public bonds issued, the greater the amount of floating capital in the market absorbed by public bonds, so the result will inevitably affect the reduction of the scope of production and the decline of the national economy. First, a list of domestic public bonds and treasury bills issued by the National Government in recent years is given below, and then a theoretical review is made.</p>

<p>20th Year Consolidated Tax Treasury Bills 80,000,000 yuan June of the 20th year Monthly interest of 8%</p>
<p>20th Year Financial Public Bonds 80,000,000 yuan October of the 20th year Annual interest of 8%</p>
<p>Jiangzhe Silk Industry Public Bonds 8,000,000 yuan 20th year Annual interest of 8%</p>
<p>Patriotic Treasury Bills 20,000,000 yuan February of the 23rd year</p>
<p>22nd Year Customs Tax Treasury Bills 100,000,000 yuan October of the 22nd year Monthly interest of 5%</p>
<p>Total 1,230,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the domestic public bonds issued by the National Government from the 16th year to the 22nd year reached a total of 113 million yuan. If public bonds and treasury bills are counted separately, public bonds are 32.7 million yuan and treasury bills are 80.3 million yuan. Treasury bills are more than twice as much as public bonds, and the interest rate on treasury bills is higher than that on public bonds. This is actually very different from the principles of issuing public bonds and treasury bills in finance. The issuance of public bonds is for special purposes to meet temporary national emergencies, or to make revenue and expenditure suitable when the budget exceeds in a fiscal year; and the issuance of treasury bills is not due to the government's insufficient budget revenue, but only to provide for the turnover of a fiscal year when the timing of revenue and expenditure does not match. Therefore, when issuing treasury bills, attention must be paid to the following points: first, the interest rate should be lower than that of public bonds; second, the recovery period should not exceed one year; third, the amount issued must be legally limited. However, the various treasury bills issued by our government in the past have no difference in their purpose from public bonds, and the interest rate is higher than that of public bonds, and the repayment period is mostly more than one year (such as the recently issued 22nd year Customs Tax Treasury Bills, which is 12 and a half years), probably to adapt to the facts without regard to theoretical principles. Moreover, few various bonds are actually received at par value, and mostly only 98% of the par value is actually received. Therefore, its interest rate is even higher than the ordinary interest rate in the financial market. What's more, when the government issues bonds each time, because it is in urgent need of cash, it first mortgages short-term loans to banks at 30% or 40% of the par value, and then the banks export the bonds to the public bond market—the securities exchange. After the manipulation and speculation of financial capitalists, the general price of this bond is only about 60%, so the bank slaps it out with its left hand and slaps it in with its right hand, so the result is that most of it is absorbed by the bank. This can be known by looking at the issuance reserve reports of the banks issuing banknotes in Shanghai, the inspection reports of various savings banks and savings associations, and the business reports of various banks for each year. Moreover, because the issuance price of various bonds is too low, that is, the purchase price is too low, the actual interest rate exceeds the ordinary interest rate by far, and the principal and interest are all paid in full when repaying, so the interest is so high that it is no different from (usury). The actual amount of money obtained by the country through borrowing is like this, which of course will lead to the increasing loss of the national treasury, the increasing financial difficulties of the country, and the increasingly severe manipulation of the government by the financial community. (Note that the interest rates on various bonds have been reduced by about 50% since the 128 Incident in the 21st year, and the repayment period has also been extended by half.) In recent years, banks in Shanghai, the financial center of the country, have become increasingly developed, while industry and commerce have shrunk day by day, becoming a deformed phenomenon. The biggest reason is actually the result of the government issuing huge amounts of public bonds year by year. The above has briefly reviewed the actual number of bonds issued by the government in recent years, and its malpractices in finance and national economy. Now let's take a further look at the recent financial situation of our country. The source of income for the Chinese government, needless to say, is first donation taxes, and second is the issuance of public bonds as mentioned above (originally public bonds are not a source of income in finance,) but in recent years, due to the continuous outbreak of domestic wars, and the continuous occurrence of droughts and floods, China has become a wasteland—the agricultural economy has collapsed, and tens of millions of people have died of starvation, which makes it impossible for the Chinese government to increase donation taxes to enrich the national treasury; moreover, with the Eastern Province Incident the year before last, the four northeastern provinces were forcibly occupied by Japanese imperialism, and all tax revenues fell into the hands of the Japanese and the puppet Manchuria. Therefore, it not only reduced a part of the central government's income, but also the northern provinces had to rely on the central government, which caused the central government to bear an additional burden. In recent years, although military and political organs have tried their best to verify and tighten up, administrative organs have reduced fees and salaries, and tax organs have actively reorganized, the crisis of national financial deficit has not been alleviated at all. According to what President Wang recently said: (Military and political expenses are short of more than 10 million yuan per month) (Shanghai Shen Bao, October 30). Therefore, in addition to the issuance of 100 million yuan of Customs Tax Treasury Bills in the 22nd year, there are recent rumors of the issuance of new Salt Tax Treasury Bills. From this, one can get a glimpse of the financial difficulties of the Nanjing government. Originally, the central government's annual income only includes customs duties, salt taxes, consolidated taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, stamp taxes, and other special taxes, totaling about 630 million yuan. However, military expenses and debt repayment and reparations alone account for more than 90% of its annual expenditure, and more than 80% of the total expenditure. Although no formal statistics have been published recently; it can be inferred from the figures from the 17th year to the 20th year of the Republic of China. The figures for military expenses and debts and reparations from the 17th year to the 20th year of the Republic of China, and the percentage they account for in the total expenditure, are listed below for reference. Year Total Expenditure Total Military Expenditure Percentage Total Debt and Reparations Percentage 17th Year 434,000,000 yuan 210,000,000 yuan 48.3 160,000,000 yuan 36.8 18th Year 539,000,000 yuan 245,000,000 yuan 46.5 200,000,000 yuan 37.1 19th Year 714,000,000 yuan 212,000,000 yuan 43.6 290,000,000 yuan 40.6 20th Year 683,000,000 yuan 304,000,000 yuan 44.4 270,000,000 yuan 39.4 As for other expenses such as internal affairs expenses and education and cultural expenses, they do not even account for 5% of the total; it is enough to show that the government has not been able to take into account the culture of the Chinese nation, as well as the people's health, protection, and relief. From the above, it is not difficult to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of our country's financial measures and their uses. Therefore, if China's financial policy is not fundamentally changed in the future, and the traditional public bond policy of relieving financial difficulties by borrowing is broken, and military expenses other than those necessary for national defense are effectively reduced; then the trend will inevitably lead to the impossibility of obtaining national expenditures, the political function will be stagnated because of this, and the foundation of public bonds will be shaken, the price will fall, the financial function will be stagnant, and even the total destruction of society will occur.</p>
<h3>Random Observations on Reorganizing Jiangsu's Finances by Hu Jianchun</h3>
<p>I humbly believe that Jiangsu Province is a rich area in the Southeast. However, in recent years, its finances have inevitably been difficult, causing stagnation in all affairs. Continuing this trend would be truly worrying. The financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province are due to two reasons: first, the mixing of responsibilities, where those in charge of political affairs also manage finances, leading to divided responsibilities and making it difficult to attend to both; second, the lack of a central economic authority, preventing the concentration of income and making it difficult to determine expenditures. The collection agencies are not unified, and the collection methods are not perfect. In addition, there is little communication between officials and the people, with a habit of mutual suspicion and observation and a lack of a spirit of cooperation. These are the main causes of the difficulties. Therefore, to promote provincial administration, financial reform is the most crucial plan. However, fundamental reform is difficult to achieve in a short time. Addressing the symptoms is easier to implement. We should consider reorganizing the current situation without excessive changes to avoid complicating matters further. The important points of addressing the symptoms are: (1) (Clarifying Responsibilities) political and financial affairs should be specialized. (2) (Unifying Collection Agencies) Taking the county as a unit, all taxes to be collected in a county should be collected by this agency, and the collection methods must be simple. (3) (Establishing Treasuries Everywhere) Each county should establish a sub-treasury collection agency that does not accept cash. The treasury is responsible for collecting taxes based on the tax bills from the collection agency, and it is also responsible for disbursing funds. If this can be implemented, malpractices can be reduced, and finances can be controlled. The provincial and county budgets should be prepared in detail. The administrator should coordinate the overall situation, prioritize urgent matters, and adjust surpluses and deficits. The order of finances can be orderly, and political affairs can be thoroughly clarified. These are just my limited observations and idealistic talks. If there are any points that can be adopted, people of Jiangsu Province and the provincial authorities may wish to use them as research material. I hereby present the plan explanation below:</p>
<p>(1) Unify the provincial treasury and establish county sub-treasuries to concentrate income and increase financial resources.</p>
<p>(Explanation) In recent years, Jiangsu Province's treasury has been empty, leading to a situation where borrowing and advances are impossible, and administrative expenses are reduced and disbursed, but still cannot be paid monthly. However, after careful examination of the province and county's regular taxes, surcharges, and other income, the estimated total annual income reaches more than 50 million yuan. After deducting water and drought disasters and short payments, the average income, calculated at 70%, should also be 35 to 36 million yuan, and the monthly payments from the province and counties also amount to 3 million yuan. Although the expenditures are also huge, with such a large amount of income, adjusting surpluses and deficits, it seems that it can still be used for turnover. The difficulty lies in the failure to determine the provincial and county treasuries and the lack of a central economic authority. Some counties deposit the collected funds, some deposit them in banks, money shops, or other places, and some挪用 (move/embezzle) them. The fact that the collected funds are scattered in various counties and cannot be concentrated in the provincial treasury causes those in charge of finance to frequently call for help, unable to find a solution. Is this a good plan? To seek reform and remedy, it seems appropriate to use the Jiangsu Provincial Bank as the provincial treasury and establish branches in various counties to manage the county treasuries, sharing the responsibility for provincial and county revenue and expenditure. This would concentrate the income of the entire province, connecting all aspects, and financial resources would naturally increase. Even if there is a shortage, it would not be difficult to adjust the surplus and deficit, and the authority for unified payment of political and financial affairs would also be clear. The specific measures are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Use the Jiangsu Bank as the provincial treasury, move the head office to the provincial capital, and be in charge of the province's financial receipts and expenditures. Other banks such as the Farmers Bank can be merged into the bank, and a Farmers Department can be set up. All business related to the Farmers Bank, such as receipts and disbursements, should still be calculated separately and not mixed. If it cannot be forcibly merged, it is not necessary to merge it. Consider it carefully.</p>
<p>(B) In all counties of the province, Jiangsu Bank branches or offices should be established to handle provincial and county treasury matters, depending on the complexity of the affairs.</p>
<p>(C) All provincial and county regular and miscellaneous taxes and surcharges in the province's counties shall be the responsibility of the Jiangsu Bank's provincial and county treasuries. According to their nature, the province, county, and items should be distinguished, and separate accounts should be established for storage, safekeeping, and payment, and they should not be stored elsewhere.</p>
<p>(2) Restore the financial bureaus in each county, abolish the various collection agencies, and unify collection to specialize responsibilities.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Provincial and county income is mainly based on the regular rice tax and land tax. The county magistrate is an official who is close to the people, and all administrative affairs are concentrated in one person, and finance occupies a large part of it. One person has limited energy, and it is difficult to see everything. To seek no malpractices, I am afraid it is impossible. Other tax revenues, such as the business tax bureau, the Shatain official property bureau, the provincial education property management office's slaughter tax, and other tax revenues, are complex and different, and the collection is not uniform. It seems appropriate to restore the financial bureaus in each county, regardless of complexity, and all of the above collection agencies should be abolished to achieve unity. All collection matters in a county should be handled by the financial bureau, with one director and one deputy director. The director should be concurrently held by the county magistrate, and the deputy director should be recommended by the finance department. Finance is independent, and there are special responsibilities. The director must be concurrently held by the county magistrate for the convenience of supervision and urging collection, and the effect is better. The specific measures are described below.</p>
<p>(A) In all counties of the province, regardless of complexity, a financial bureau must be established.</p>
<p>(B) All provincial and county regular and attached rice tax, land tax, deed tax, business tax, and tooth tax and slaughter tax belonging to the provincial education management office, as well as Shatain official property income, and all other miscellaneous taxes in all counties of the province shall be classified and collected by the financial bureau.</p>
<p>(C) There is one director and one deputy director of the financial bureau. The director is responsible for planning all financial matters of the county and is responsible for supervising and urging collection; the deputy director is responsible for the administrative management of the bureau and exercises the authority of auditing, collecting, and rectifying. The director is concurrently held by the county magistrate of each county, and the deputy director is recommended by the finance department and appointed by the provincial government.</p>
<p>(D) Except for collection agencies that do not belong to a county or are established for special projects, all bureaus and offices of the business tax, slaughter tax, and Shatain official property, as well as other collection agencies, in the province shall be abolished and merged into the financial bureaus of each county for unified collection.</p>
<p>(3) Unify and improve the collection system, reduce the burden on the people, and increase the income of the provincial and county treasuries.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Financial institutions are full of malpractices, and even the wise cannot avoid them. According to the total provincial and county rice tax, regular surcharge and land tax, the average annual income is more than 30 million yuan, and the extra illegal collections by officials and clerks are afraid to be more than 10%. Even if calculated at 10%, the people of the province pay more than 3 million yuan of illegal collection in addition to the 30 million yuan of taxes they should pay. As for the losses due to挪用 (move/embezzle) and encroachment by officials and clerks, it is also calculated at 10%, and the province and county lose more than 3 million yuan of taxes every year. In addition, the collection agencies must also pay expenses, so挪用 (move/embezzle) and墊墊 (pad) are rampant, and both the government and the people suffer losses, and the only beneficiaries are officials and clerks! It seems appropriate that the collection agencies do not collect cash, and are only responsible for approving tax rates and filling out vouchers. The treasury collects money, and the tax money can only be collected with the tax bill of the collection agency, and the responsibility for payment is also changed to the treasury. The collection agency has no trouble in paying, and there is no挪用 (move/embezzle). In this way, those in charge of finance do not see cash and do not work hard to pay. Even if the malpractices cannot be completely eliminated, they can be cleared a lot. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The rice tax and land tax of each county shall still be temporarily sorted out according to the local conditions of each county and shall not be greatly changed for the time being. In each district that has been delineated in each county, the number of grain households in each district and the amount of tax to be collected shall be selected and appointed from the original book clerks by the bureau to be responsible for the matters of making registers, sending bills, and urging collection in each district, and the district chiefs and township chiefs shall assist them. Or, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance shall make and issue all the bills of rice tax and land tax in each county, following the method of Wujin and Wuxi Yitu.</p>
<p>(B) All tax revenues other than rice tax and land tax shall still be sorted out and collected separately according to the original methods for the time being.</p>
<p>(C) All donations and taxes shall be collected by the bureaus at the counter, and sub-counters may be set up as appropriate.</p>
<p>(D) At the same time as each bureau sets up a collection counter, the Jiangsu Bank shall set up a provincial and county treasury tax collection office at the same location and send personnel to collect the money.</p>
<p>(E) Except for the rice tax and land tax, which are paid by the taxpayer to the treasury tax collection office with the notification slip, for other donations and taxes, when the taxpayer goes to the counter, the collection clerk shall calculate and fill out the tax bill for the amount to be paid, and hand it over to the taxpayer to pay to the treasury tax collection office. The taxpayer obtains the treasury receipt, and the receipt is used as cash to pay to the counter. After receiving the treasury receipt, the counter gives the taxpayer a serial ticket or receipt.</p>
<p>(F) All collection counters of the financial bureau shall not collect cash, and the treasury tax collection office shall not collect money without the land tax notification slip of the financial bureau and the tax bill of other tax revenues in order to prevent malpractices.</p>
<p>(G) The financial bureau and the treasury tax collection office shall compare the receipts and totals of each item every day to ensure that there are no errors, and shall fill out a form on the next day and report them separately to the General Treasury, the Provincial Government Finance Department, the Provincial Education Property Management Office, the county government, and the property office. The reporting form shall also be made and issued by the Finance Department.</p>
<p>(H) The Provincial Government Finance Department shall formulate the reward and punishment regulations for the county financial bureau directors, deputy bureau chiefs,主管佐治 (responsible governance) personnel, collection clerks, and district chiefs and township chiefs who should assist in the collection of each item in each county to prevent laziness and encourage them.</p>
<p>(4) Unify the collection fees to benefit income and eliminate embezzlement.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Since the establishment of the county financial bureaus, there have been achievements. However, because of the problem of political austerity, the county governments have been abolished. Now, if we plan to set them up in all counties of the province and have to set up treasuries, the political expenses will inevitably increase sharply. The expenses of the provincial financial affairs include the expenses of the second section of the county government, the business tax bureau, the Shatain official property bureau, and the slaughter tax bureau, or the commission and the handling fees of the rice tax and land tax collection and deed tax and tooth tax in each county. The number is considerable. If the financial bureau unifies the collection and all other collection agencies are abolished, the above expenses, as well as the collection fees of rice tax and land tax, and the handling fees of other tax revenues, shall still be proposed according to the original expenses, and the provincial department shall uniformly allocate them and propose to subsidize the Jiangsu Bank's losses in setting up treasuries throughout the province. If this is handled in this way, the provincial financial expenses may not increase the burden and turn private into public. The methods are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) The expenses of the financial bureaus of each county shall be used for the expenses of the second section of each county government and the expenses or commissions of the business tax bureau, slaughter tax bureau, and Shatain official property bureau of each county, and the handling fees of tooth tax and deed tax.</p>
<p>(B) The collection fees of the rice tax and land tax of each county shall still be publicized according to the original number, or sorted out as appropriate, and shall be used for the collection fees of the financial bureaus of each county.</p>
<p>(C) All of the above collection fees shall be deposited separately in the provincial and county treasuries and stored in special accounts.</p>
<p>(D) All the collection fees and the expenses of each county's financial bureau and the expenses to be paid shall be prepared and included in the provincial and county budgets by the Finance Department. After the determination, all receipts and expenditures of the collection fees of each county shall be uniformly allocated by the Finance Department.</p>
<p>(E) In addition to the short-term interest on the tax money collected and stored by the Jiangsu Bank's sub-treasuries and county treasuries in each county, if the provincial treasury needs to subsidize them, it may be appropriately subsidized from the above collection fees.</p>
<p>(5) Determine the provincial and county budgets, and strive to make the income and expenditure suitable, so as to value the annual plan and reduce the burden.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The Jiangsu Bank is the provincial and county treasury, responsible for the important task of provincial and county receipts and expenditures. Only with storage in the treasury can it be paid. Even if it can be used for temporary adjustment and turnover, there must be a solid compensation. Therefore, the provincial and county budget income and expenditure must be suitable, and there must be actual income. The impact of the frequent financial difficulties in Jiangsu Province in recent years is due to the虛收實支 (false income and actual expenditure). Therefore, when preparing the provincial and county budgets, they must be reviewed by provincial and county people. In addition to making the income and expenditure suitable, the actual income must be verified to gain the trust of the people of each county. The methods are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Determine the provincial annual budget. In addition to tightening the expenditure of political expenses, the income must be practical, and the deficit shall be offset by the actual income.</p>
<p>(B) Each county shall prepare the budget of the county and submit it to the provincial department for approval. The nature is the same as item A.</p>
<p>(C) After the provincial and county budgets are determined, the amount to be paid for regular expenses each month and the amount to be moved for temporary expenses must have money, and they shall not be mixed with regular expenses to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>(D) When the county budget is prepared by the county government, it shall invite local people with heavy prestige to form a county budget review committee to review and decide, and then the county government shall submit it to the province for review. When the provincial budget is prepared by the provincial government, it shall invite local gentlemen and experts with heavy prestige in the province to form a provincial budget review committee to review and decide, and then the provincial government shall submit it to the central government for reporting.</p>
<p>(E) Whether it is a province or a county, no money shall be moved unless it is included in the budget.</p>
<p>(6) The provincial and county budget expenses shall be paid on a monthly basis by the provincial and county treasuries on a regular basis on the spot to facilitate administration.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The mixing of political and financial affairs is indeed a major cause of political obstruction. Because the financial order is chaotic, the political order is also chaotic, which is really helpless. In recent years, in Jiangsu Province, such as the political expenses of government offices, the salaries of officials and servants, the expenses of education, and the military and police salaries, are often owed for several months. The Finance Department sends a notice to the payment agencies, and the agencies ordered to pay always have no money to pay. Often, one month's expenses must be paid in several places. Those who receive the money go back and forth, sometimes there is and sometimes there is not, or they are paid in several times for several months and finally cannot be paid off. Those who receive the money are like collecting debts, and they are already exhausted. The payers are like avoiding debts, and they feel deeply the trouble of coping. If the collection agency does not collect cash, it can avoid the trouble of paying. If the treasury is responsible for the receipts and disbursements, it can avoid the malpractice of delay. The expenses determined in the provincial and county budgets should be classified and specified the time of payment in order of priority each month, and the local treasuries should pay them on time and in full. The provincial and county political and educational expenses can be used on time, the financial order is fixed, and the political affairs can be renewed. The money collected and stored in each county's treasury is managed by a management committee, and payment must be made with the seal and joint payment, so there is no need to worry about the misunderstandings of local people in each county. The methods are proposed as follows:</p>
<p>(A) After determining the amount of each item of expenditure of the province according to the budget, the category and the date of payment in order of priority each month, the Finance Department shall issue a payment order to the Provincial Treasury in advance of the specified date of each month, and at the same time issue a notice to each receiving agency, and pay it at the Jiangsu Bank Provincial Sub-Treasury where it is located on schedule with the notice, so as to avoid the difficulties of the receiving agencies going back and forth, delaying payments, and paying in installments.</p>
<p>(B) Each item of local donations and taxes in each county shall be managed by a committee of each category. Storage in the treasury can only be paid. Except for those approved by the Provincial Government Finance Department and notified to the treasury, they shall not be挪用 (move/embezzle) and borrowed.</p>
<p>(C) For the expenses of each county, after the method in item A is determined, each month, payment shall be made with the joint seal of the county magistrate, the deputy director of the financial bureau, the director of the county property management office, and the representative member of the management committee.</p>
<p>(D) For each item of local donations and taxes in each county, if it is a long-term deposit or a fixed term, the bank shall give monthly interest if it is not paid monthly.</p>
<p>(7) Increase the strength of the Jiangsu Bank to consolidate the provincial and county treasuries and strengthen people's trust.</p>
<p>(Explanation) According to the above methods, the treasury is the center of the province's finance, and the responsibility is very important. Only when the Jiangsu Bank, which manages the provincial and county treasuries of the province, has sufficient strength can it consolidate the faith of the local people in each county, so that it can bear the responsibility of adjusting surplus and deficit. It seems appropriate to appoint people with heavy prestige from each administrative district to participate in the Supervisory Committee and increase its capital, expand its business, and handle savings to strengthen its strength and strengthen people's trust. The methods are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) The organization of the Supervisory Committee of the Jiangsu Bank shall be chaired by the Provincial Government, and the directors of the four departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, and education and the director of the Provincial Education Property Management Office shall be ex officio members. In addition, one gentleman with heavy prestige shall be elected or invited from each of the thirteen administrative districts as a member to clarify the content and strengthen people's trust.</p>
<p>(B) The Jiangsu Bank shall seek the development of its business, appropriately increase its capital, or add commercial shares to strengthen its strength, handle savings to increase the economy of the people in the interior, develop remittance and exchange business to adjust commerce, and seek to remedy the rural areas.</p>

<h3>Securities: Last Week's Bond Market Rallied Vigorously - The Increase Ranged from Two Yuan to Four or Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Last week (December 4 to 9), the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly experienced a huge reactionary rally. The intensity was no less than the previous sharp decline. The market price recovered three-quarters of its value. Compared with the lowest price of the previous week, it has rebounded by a huge amount of eight or nine yuan. Although speculation was active, investors also occupied a considerable position. On the surface, the environment was both war and peace, neither close nor far, and was still brewing. Military operations are being actively prepared, and peace envoys are constantly on their way. The key lies in the position of the Guangdong side, which is crucial. The so-called Ministry of Finance's investigation of the treasury in banks and the transfer of cotton and wheat loans to purchase government bonds are just superficial talks. The Fourth Plenary Session is about to open. Whether the Guangdong members of the Central Committee can attend and whether the meeting can be held on schedule are the general pivot of the current situation. The government bond market is in extreme shock. Speculators and investors are advancing on both sides. The government bond deposits are accumulating higher and higher. The total number in two months has reached nearly 80 million yuan at the highest. Therefore, the ups and downs are becoming more and more restless. In a week, the delivery is gradually approaching, so the future storms have not been able to report calm. On Monday, the so-called third government was invisibly eliminated, and the southwest did not take sides. The market price continued to rise by more than one yuan following the weekend's rebound. On the 4th, there were more purchases, and the northern gang was also busy补空 (short covering). On Tuesday, there were rumors of the Ministry of Finance investigating the treasury and transferring cotton and wheat loans to deposit government bonds. The voices of peace in the current situation gradually rose, and there was more short covering. The market price continued to rise by more than one yuan. On Wednesday, the voice of peace gradually thickened. The future of Fujian may be resolved through political means. The short sellers were even more慌张 (panic), and large investors poured in even more. The market price rose even more sharply, rising by more than one yuan to 2.23 yuan. On Thursday, large investors were still eager to進胃 (digest), and the northern gang and retail short sellers抵補 (offset). The market price rose by another one or two yuan. The continuous rise has already rebounded by a huge amount of eight or nine yuan. The number of deposits has decreased from 80 million to 60 million. This month, it is only over 30 million. On Thursday, due to the southwest's insistence, it rebounded again. Due to the high price, the多頭 (bulls) came out, and the price fell by about one yuan. On Saturday, it seemed a little恍惚 (distracted), rising and falling suddenly, fluctuating and uncertain. As a result, it fell by a little more than one yuan again. As a result of the week's market price, the increase ranged from two yuan to four or five yuan. The total turnover was 17,720,050 yuan. The highs, lows, and increases and decreases are listed in the left category.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Market Gradually Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was still good. The guild quoted 24 for coarse granulated white ordinary goods. The previous day's bid was 19 yuan and 9 jiao. Those that were not successful yesterday have now been traded. Re-export bills of lading are also quoted at 7 yuan. If Customs Gold rises again today, there is hope for continued tightness. Medium granulated white sugar numbered 18 to 20 was slightly quoted at 19 yuan and a half. Re-exported goods from Holland numbered 8 and 9 were quoted at 7 yuan, but there were no spot transactions. Taikoo Sugar spot B mark was quoted at 20 yuan, 2 jiao and a half. Those that can be shipped on Thursday and Friday are 20 yuan and 1 jiao. Zhen Ji No. 1 cotton white is still 18 yuan and 8 jiao. Sliced green opened again at more than 600 boxes, priced at 10 yuan. Xin Chao green arrived the day before yesterday with more than 200 packages, and were all sold yesterday, with the bill of lading being 15 yuan and 3 jiao. Gao Ban Nan green is 14 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Foreign Firm White Tung Oil Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Since the price of white tung oil from Zhejiang and Wuhan has repeatedly fallen, recently, according to reports from the Wuhan market, foreign firms selling opened at a price drop of 22 yuan, 5 or 6 jiao for about a hundred or so tons of transactions. Therefore, Wuhan firms' purchases are also very indifferent. In recent days, Xiang Tung prices have been opened at 18 yuan, 3 or 4 jiao, and supporting the basket is 17 yuan, 8 or 9 jiao, only five or six thousand dan. In the Jinlan area of Zhejiang Province, commerce is not without impact. Since selling Hangzhou at 19 yuan per zhu after Jiang transaction, Hangzhou firms still want cheaper prices, and the producing areas are still not convinced, so although the market situation has been sluggish in recent days, there has been no sharp drop. However, if the situation is like this, it is not known whether it can last.</p>

<h3>Reflected from (The Great Sale)</h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>The most profound and thought-provoking impression that the (Oriental Paris) of Shanghai, this ten-mile foreign concession, has given me should be the (Great Sale). I remember that eight years ago, when I passed through Fourth Malu, I saw several woolen and silk shops flying banners proclaiming (Great Sale for Two Weeks). More than a few (weeks) passed, and the (Great Sale) signs had not yet been removed. Later, every year and a half, I would occasionally pass by the door of those companies and find that the (Great Sale for Two Weeks) deadline had been officially extended to a month on the banner. Since then, fur coats and summer dresses have been changed many times, and the sale signs of those shops have also been constantly renewed, but the (Great Sale) deadline is actually (endless and eternal)! From this, I have understood the (eternally new) threshold of the (Great Sale) for some Shanghai merchants.</p>
<p>In addition, I have also (inquired) at several large silk shops that (buy one foot get one foot free), but unfortunately the prices are all above two yuan, as if they were originally multiplied by the number (two); there are also (modern crepe) and (era silk) that cost four or five jiao a foot, but the material is hard and thin, not only rayon, but also many are made by workers from (friendly countries). In the recent year or two, the trend of (Great Sales) and (Great Auctions) has obviously become more popular in all walks of life in the Shanghai market. Passing through every bustling or remote road, we can see colorful price-cutting paper strips posted high inside and outside the shops, and hear (foreign drums and horns) playing the most unpleasant Sizhou tune. This seemingly lively but actually miserable phenomenon is not far from the stage of (everything is reduced in price) and (every store is auctioning). Moreover, (reduction) and (auction) do not seem to allow every store to survive this year of (Baihu) and (Taisui coming to the head). So, on the various roads, we often see some shops with strips of paper given by the court pasted in the cracks of the doors.</p>
<p>Because the (Great Sale) trend in Shanghai is sweeping through the sky, speculative and slippery (business tactics) have also manifested themselves in many ways. Half a month ago, the newspapers often had advertisements for (buy three woolen sweaters for one yuan), (buy two fountain pens for one yuan and get a mechanical pencil for free), and (buy twelve or twenty (Laikin rings) for one yuan). However, for these (foreign firm office) businesses, if buyers go to the store to try them out, their reply will definitely be (sold out). You better remit money from other places to buy (cheap goods), because that way, even if you are fooled, you will not (deal) with the seller. There is also a (big gift) of buying (four taels of Western ginseng for one yuan). I have a friend who tried it. The goods are similar to ordinary (rice ginseng) that costs one yuan per tael, but the balance used by the (office) is (specially made), and each tael is full of two qian and five!</p>
<p>For these ever-changing and varied (Great Sales), we can explain them from the following points:</p>
<p>First, it is a reflection of the great bankruptcy of Chinese society: Because of the decline of all industries and the collapse of the countryside, the purchasing power of the middle and lower classes of society has been weakened to the extreme. The market for various daily necessities is becoming increasingly narrow. Although the shops are painfully auctioning, the number of visitors is still very small. Shop owners are often in a panic and have to use all means to absorb cash in order to cope with the various disasters of this period, the end of the year, and the end of the year (camels passing through the eye of a needle). So (big sales) and (great price reductions) in Shanghai and even throughout the country have changed from (occasional competition) to (constant desperation); the owners are certainly suffering, but the countless (passing by the butcher's door and gorging themselves), citizens with no money in their hands are even more unimaginable. Therefore, every (great sale), (selling at a loss) slogan should be regarded as a sore of Chinese society that is terminally ill.</p>
<p>Second, it is a reflection of the imperialist (dumping) policy. Since the (economic depression) swept the world, every imperialist has brought a dumping policy to China, a land of abundance), to find a (Dala). Foreign goods are imported in overwhelming quantities, constantly and little by little, squeezing national industry and commerce into a dead end. The phenomenon of (Great Sales) that is common in the Shanghai market, on the one hand, shows the dumping of imperialist goods in China, and on the other hand, it shows that Chinese national industrial products are selling at a loss in order to (be inferior).</p>
<p>Third, it is a reflection of the bankruptcy of Chinese commercial ethics: Since Chinese commerce is mostly on the verge of (dying) due to the oppression of foreign goods and the bankruptcy of going to meetings, the decline of commercial ethics is naturally inevitable. Imperialist commerce certainly relies on advertisements that are willing to spend money to (brag), but few (brag) so much that they cannot see their own shadows like Chinese slippery businesses! The result of (bragging) that is too far from reality, on the contrary, makes all advertisements ineffective and accelerates the failure of one's own business. Many shops continue to close their doors after years of (Great Sales), which is due to this drawback.</p>
<p>(Great Sales) are the cries and struggles of Chinese industrialists and businessmen who cannot find a way out, but they are only cries and struggles! The real way out for Chinese merchants is not how to dump, how to (reduce prices), but to stand on the front line of the national anti-imperialist movement. Other than that, I can only see their (pitch-black) future!</p>
<h3>Go to the Army</h3>
<p>— Shao Peng</p>
<p>That year, I was oppressed by certain circumstances, and my hometown was no longer a place where I could live and work in peace. So I had to embark on a wandering journey, still hoping to develop a satisfactory situation in the face of adversity. As someone who had just come into contact with society, I naturally still had high hopes for society and had not yet experienced how cold society was and that humans only had a ferocious face. After spending a considerable amount of time in Han Gao, I tasted the bitterness and hardships of the world, realistically observed many bloody facts, and my youthful life suffered the first arrow of injury. In the extreme predicament of being desperate to make a living in four places and running out of travel expenses, in order to be unable to bear the whip of life's urging, (go to the army) became the only appropriate slogan for me to find a job at that time. Things finally came true.</p>
<p>After an introduction by a friend, Mr. X, I filled a sergeant clerk vacancy in the X company. I took off my original student uniform, put on a mismatched gray military uniform, and wore a leather belt around my waist, looking exactly like a soldier. But from the company commander to the brothers, everyone called me (Teacher), and I was really stunned when I first heard it. How could I inherit such a respectable title? This was only available in the era of the emperor. Later, when I saw that other sergeant clerks were also called the same way, I became accustomed to it and didn't pay attention to it. When I first started working, I didn't understand any official business, and the language was also impenetrable. The lieutenant quartermaster became my direct superior, and I had to follow his instructions in everything. What rosters, fights, etc., there were so many tricks that they were all assigned to you, and you couldn't finish writing them all day long. I remember that when the work was tight, I hadn't gone to bed for several nights in a row. As for the salary, it was said to be twenty yuan, but after half a year or eight months, it hadn't been paid, and I could only get a small amount of food money each month. The brothers were even more difficult to get this, because the food provided by the superiors was sometimes not enough to eat. (The general regulation in the Chinese army is that officers get twelve yuan for food each month, and soldiers get six yuan, but sergeant clerks are in the ranks of officers.)</p>
<p>At that time, our troops were stationed in X County, Hubei. God was really making fun of the poor. When it came to the Mid-Autumn Festival, I especially felt the cold air invading. I didn't have a cotton quilt, and I slept on a hard bamboo bed. In terms of area, it was less than a foot wide and not long enough for my body. Every night, I curled up like a hedgehog, wrapped in a thin paper-thin sheet, gritted my teeth and endured the attack of the cold autumn wind. All the bones and muscles of my body were painfully twisted by the bamboo bed. Since I couldn't turn over, I just stared blankly at the dawn. The origin of my insomnia was probably planted deeply at this time.</p>
<p>At that time, the antipathy that arose in my own spirit and the blows I suffered in my will were undoubtedly unparalleled. This inhuman camp life was quite different from the past ease and comfort of student life. However, time flew by like lightning, and I hurriedly endured the alternating torment of wind, snow, rain and dew, and spent the two seasons of autumn and winter. Then, the great war of the warlord XX Shi - the crusade against XX, broke out at this time. Both sides mobilized hundreds of thousands of troops, and the front line stretched for thousands of miles. Everyone fought fiercely, and I could not help but become a passive member of this war group.</p>

<h3>A Group of People Collecting Coal Cinders</h3>
<p>— Jin Jia</p>
<p>At the bottom of the car carrying coal cinders in Gary, a group of poor and destitute men and women were tightly surrounded.</p>
<p>Every time a shovel of coal cinders was shoveled off the car, the situation was very tense. Sharp eyes and agile hands picked up the pieces of coal cinders into their broken baskets, as precious as the rich treat money.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Come and squeeze me!" said Xiao Sanzi, a bald boy wearing a pair of shorts and a vest.</p>
<p>"Who's squeezing you? Little devil." The one who answered was Sister-in-law Jin. She wore an old men's straw hat, a gray jacket, a pair of pants with four patches in the front and back, a black sock on her left foot, and a torn silk stocking on her right foot.</p>
<p>"You're the little devil! Damn it! Are you scolding me?"</p>
<p>"Okay! You little bastard."</p>
<p>A pile of coal cinders was shoveled off the car, and Xiao Sanzi and Sister-in-law Jin were only concerned with picking up coal cinders, so the drama did not continue.</p>
<p>"You get out of the way! This is my territory!" Someone else started arguing across from them.</p>
<p>"Your territory? Is your name written on it? Really shameless!" Another pile of coal was shoveled from the car, and the sound subsided with the coal cinders.</p>
<p>"Damn it, you're squeezing me again!" Xiao Sanzi became anxious again.</p>
<p>"Willing to squeeze!" Sister-in-law Jin squeezed to the side angrily, or perhaps she used too much force. Unfortunately, the pair of pants with four patches was torn a big hole again.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>"What's so funny!" Sister-in-law Jin really blushed with shame.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>Another pile of coal cinders was shoveled from the car.</p>
<p>It was getting dark, and a group of men and women collecting coal cinders were still picking there.</p>

<h3>(Our) Writer</h3>
<p>— Mu Lang</p>
<p>Our writer lay slumped in a chair with four legs that had already loosened, which indicated how violently its owner shook his body when writing. He held a cigarette in his hand, and his lifeless eyes fell on a few blank sheets of paper spread out in front of him. No matter what, he couldn't use the tip of his pen and ink to draw a little pattern on these blank sheets of paper. Our writer straightened his body, and he rethought what he had just thought: wine, thighs, embraces, waltzes, tangos, the scent of flesh, fragrant tremors, breasts ... distortion, consciousness, lines! Dockworkers, chimneys, sweat, performances ... pilgrimages, scenic lines, sketches ... His brain gradually felt dizzy, and he doubted that he could not string together a coherent (Shakespeare's) from these fragments. He muttered: I really can't do it today!</p>
<p>Time slipped away moment by moment, and the vast twilight crawled in from the small window, making the pavilion even darker. Our writer didn't seem to notice, he just accelerated the rotation of his thoughts; the smell of smoke filled the room. Suddenly, a familiar sound of leather shoes came up from the stairs below, followed by our writer's friend, Mr. B, pushing the door open. He was also a writer, and he was not yours or theirs.</p>
<p>"Ha! Old Ying, what are you doing here? Looking for materials? I just came out of XX after watching a dance. That last scene with the models was really something, hehe ..."</p>
<p>"Who's like you with so much free time and money! I promised XX to write an article, but it still hasn't been settled yet." Our writer frowned tightly, his eyes looking at the ground.</p>
<p>"Brother, don't tease me, who has a lot of free time and money? I went to see the XX troupe's song and dance, wasn't it just to write a critique? You think, a review can be exchanged for two yuan, subtracting the one yuan for the ticket, there's still one yuan left; isn't this just for making a living?"</p>
<p>Our writer was sad, and the stars were temporarily silent. Finally, he stood up, patted Mr. B on the shoulder and said,</p>
<p>"We always have to have a place to stand, and it's not a solution to rely on contributing scraps like this all the time. I heard that the X newspaper is going to add a literary supplement. You know the editor-in-chief there. You might as well talk to him and see if we can edit it together."</p>
<p>"The editor of the literary supplement has already been hired. Moreover, the X newspaper's attitude is very serious, and it won't want a blind translator and film critic like you. As for me, that's even more unnecessary."</p>
<p>"I don't understand why you always like to destroy your own people's prestige. What's so difficult about being the editor of a literary supplement? According to you, you're willing to live a life of submitting articles forever? Tell me, what are your future plans?"</p>
<p>"I'm writing a long novel."</p>
<p>"A long novel?" Our writer was surprised by his friend's cold attitude.</p>
<p>"Yes," Mr. B closed his eyes, his face showing a very proud expression, "A long novel, I plan to write 400,000 words. It's all my observations of real life. There are the oppressed cries of the working masses, the faithful exposure of the cross-section of society, the revelation of the eve of the storm ... A writer must have a great creation to become famous, he must ..."</p>
<p>Our writer's constant shaking of his head suppressed his friend's courage to continue speaking excitedly.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, you shouldn't brag in front of me. How can a shallow teenager like you who is completely urbanized talk about (observations of real life)? And, and, haha, (the working masses)? Don't you be delusional about becoming a novelist!"</p>
<p>"Why do you always tease people? Yourself ..." Mr. B was so anxious that he couldn't speak.</p>
<p>"Enough idle talk, you got twenty yuan in royalties yesterday, but you haven't treated me yet. A new Russian restaurant opened next door, and the cooking is very good. You're the host tonight."</p>
<p>Mr. B reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p>Our writer was very happy. In addition to having a free meal, today's difficulty was also solved, because he had already obtained the material for an article. As he dragged Mr. B into the Russian restaurant, he thought, (The title should be (Exotic Flavor)).</p>

<h3>A Metropolitan Morning</h3>
<p>— Kiss Heart</p>
<p>Rubies of light shimmer on the eastern horizon, one or two white clouds drift in the azure sky, the wind passes like a cool, large hand stroking, the deep green of the trees on both sides of the road turning light yellow, the road lying quietly in this bright autumn light, as if not yet awakened.</p>
<p>The factory sirens echo across the four fields of the metropolis, these large clusters of black peonies, this powerful roar - the factory area suddenly becomes lively, men and women workers carry lunch bags or lunch baskets, they face the morning sun and plunge into the iron arms of the machines.</p>
<p>Young students run and jump happily on the road, those elastic legs, those eyes that reveal the light of progress, their scattered laughter bounces in the fresh air, their full faces are like rubies on the eastern horizon.</p>
<p>Sometimes one or two cars speed past, big-bellied men and petite women falling listlessly into the carriages, those dark circles around their eyes, those pale white faces, those legs and arms that can't be lifted, the red and green lights spinning in their heads ...</p>
<p>The sun poked out its head to look, and smiled!</p>
<h3>Reading the Wind and Steering the Rudder</h3>
<p>— Er Chu</p>
<p>Someone said: the world is a (stage), and we are all (actors) playing on the (stage). I am deeply afraid that this is not quite practical and considerate, so I have presumptuously transformed it and said: the world is a vast and boundless (sea), society is a small (boat) drifting in the (sea), and we are all hiding on the stern of the boat, able to command the advance or retreat of the boat's body is the (rudder). But this (rudder) is very (difficult to steer); one mistake, not only do you yourself have (life) worries, but the entire boat body also has the danger of (overturning). By chance, you barely escape the key to (total annihilation) and go astray. Unfortunately, you are swept away by the (wind and waves) in the (sea). But no matter whether it is (total annihilation) or going (astray), (small pain) is always going to give you a taste of the flavor sooner or later. Therefore, the clever ones would rather deviate from the predetermined (goal) and (read the wind and steer the rudder), even if they go astray. The stupid ones stubbornly stick to their own (goal), desperately fighting the (wind), and in the end eat (immediate losses). But whether or not you can ultimately achieve your (goal) is another question.</p>
<p>We are born in a year where everything has to be (fashionable) and everything has to be (modern), and those who stubbornly stick to their own (goal) and fight the (wind) to the death should naturally also be (?) all included in the example of (survival of the fittest); because even if you are a great enlightenment person, your adherence may only be a (big fool), inevitably being bullied by your own kind; therefore, you should also (?)(retire), allowing the (fittest) who (read the wind and steer the rudder) to gradually grow. If you are unwilling to (weaken yourself), then honestly and without politeness, you have to swallow the (immediate losses) of punches and kicks. And if you want to (change your appearance) and get by in society, then you must not only learn a set of (reading the wind and steering the rudder) (tricks), but also have the (obligation) to support those who (read the wind and steer the rudder), and should give them a big boost; (never shout them down) and then you will also have a day when you are (boosted). Therefore, the (skill) of (flattering) and (bragging) is certainly indispensable, but the (trick) of (reading the wind and steering the rudder) must also be learned, so as to avoid eating (immediate losses), but the subsequent cases are not included.</p>
<p>For example, if someone says: (It's cold today). You should answer very quickly: (Yes! It's much colder today than yesterday). It's best to pretend to be shivering, so you can show your (sincerity). And if Gan Yi says: (It's hot today). You should also answer very quickly: (Yes! It's even hotter today than yesterday). It's best to take off all your clothes, to show the attitude of (even hotter). But if Bing says: (Let's play mahjong)! You must not seriously say straight: (I'm not coming) or (I don't know how). Then he will be annoyed with you. You should immediately lift the table, dump the tiles, and pretend to know how, and you'd rather regret the money. Other things can be deduced by analogy. But at the same time, pay attention: before you have obtained the position of (being boosted), be sure to avoid preemptive strikes: you should always be a very (sincere) answerer and supporter.</p>
<p>In short, you must use this (rudder) to flexibly read the wind and turn: the wind is east, then east, the wind is west, then west, the words (wrong path) can be temporarily abandoned, anyway, (immediate losses) can be avoided. He's coming, you entertain. He's gone, you see him off at the door. One million (agreements), one million (approvals). Not enough, you can (add two), and say it even more enthusiastically. Then, I guarantee that you can be (welcomed) everywhere, and (loved) everywhere; and you will definitely say to your sorrowful wife with a twinkle in your eyes: (Luck has come! I'm not bumping into walls anymore! I'm not hitting nails anymore)! Then, the wife also smiles.</p>
<h3>The Polygonal Night</h3>
<p>— By Ping</p>
<p>Night, the darkness that has remained unmoving for tens of millions of years. A mass of people, living here, living...</p>
<p>The tremulous sounds of a four-stringed instrument emanate from the hands of a blind poet in a small inn on that side; one sound after another, weighing down a group of wanderers who spend their lives away from home, quietly, silently, facing the boundless night, shedding bitter tears.</p>
<p>Silver-red lights descend from the sky to the ground, and people on the ground spin under the lights: fat men smoking cigars occupying the sidewalks, fortune tellers with cold eyes wandering the streets, celestial beauties in massage parlors, long-haired painters, children selling evening newspapers, women selling their souls, savage white sailors, gentlemen wearing Jesus masks, black men controlling traffic lights, majestic Danish police dogs, elementary school teachers without a home, red-lipped coffee shop waitresses, disillusioned decadent youths, and also, cars, ambulances, moving vans, trams, carts, thighs, leather shoes, perfume, flirtatious glances, beer... Ah! Passing by! Passing by! Flying past! Flying past! Fleeing in one breath to the quieter side; unfortunately, next to the garbage heap on that side, there also lies a torn photograph of a woman.</p>
<p>Music starts to play! Come on! Let's have a waltz!</p>
<p>(Ah! You are so beautiful! You are so touching! And, your dancing is so wonderful! So wonderful! Ah! I want to exchange my life for your love!)</p>
<p>(Heh! My... You are so foolish.)</p>
<p>Going up to the third floor, a delicate little room, the room is rolling, the heart is dancing, the bed is beckoning, and also, the coffin is beckoning... It's over...</p>
<p>On that other side, in another corner, a group of people in tattered clothes are completing a building for the propertied class. Suddenly, a slip of the foot, a young man in his twenties, falls from the fourth floor! What is found on the ground is a pile of meat, a mass of blood, and that's how he died! His wife is crying loudly, his companions are crying silently.</p>
<p>On a quiet road, suddenly, a car rushes out sideways, and a man carrying watermelons is knocked down instantly! He injured a leg, and this leg will never be good again.</p>
<p>(Oh! Injured a leg? It's alright! Just a little bit. Come! It's my bad luck again! Take this ten yuan, go heal your leg.)</p>
<p>The money, like meat, dances before blurred eyes, dancing in a pit of red blood.</p>
<p>A phone call reports a crime of passion on XX Road. The newspaper immediately sends a reporter to investigate. That's a great news story, and it has to be printed in large font tomorrow.</p>
<p>A young man who doesn't smoke opium buys four ounces of opium and goes to a room at XX Inn...</p>
<p>On the banks of the Huangpu River, a woman with tear-stained face wanders aimlessly...</p>
<p>Night, the darkness that has remained unmoving for tens of millions of years.</p>
<h3>Amateur Mailbox: New Undertaking of Shen Bao Circulating Library</h3>
<p>Dear Executive:</p>
<p>Your thorough planning for us is deeply appreciated; I am determined to rejoin in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Indeed, our society needs, and earnestly hopes that we move towards the path of science. However, it—science—simply makes me feel dazed, as tasteless as chewing wax; I know, I know for sure, that I lack guidance too much and have no system. I earnestly hope that your (reading guidance) will give me detailed instructions.</p>
<p>At the same time, I will make further requests, that you could best invite several academic mentors for us, to answer our doubts when our comprehension is sometimes unable to resolve them. I wonder if that's possible? Wishing you peace, Chen Hongzhuang.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The above is a reply letter recently received by this newspaper's circulating library from one of its former readers who had already withdrawn. Originally, the library recently conducted a rigorous review of its work over the past year in preparation for holding a one-week anniversary, and found that although the number of current members had reached more than 3,700, if there were no dropouts, then the total number of members should have exceeded 5,000, and the effectiveness of the work could have been increased by at least one-third. Therefore, it went further to study the reasons why these 1,700 to 1,800 people withdrew, as a basis for planning countermeasures. As a result, it was confirmed that their withdrawal was due to the following three major reasons: (1) leaving Shanghai due to business. (2) Feeling that there were too few books. (3) Fumbling around blindly, unable to feel any interest. Therefore, the determined countermeasures also include the following three items: (1) Discussing expanding the service scope to other provinces. (2) Purchasing more books. (3) Adding a (reading guidance) department. The first item of expanding the scope of services cannot be decided on a date of implementation for the time being, because the matter is significant. The second item has already added more than 3,000 new books in the most recent month—the total number of books in the collection now exceeds 11,000. The third item (reading guidance) work is currently compiling self-study guides for various subjects, and is preparing to open a special column in this newspaper starting from January next year, to answer readers' questions. Although we do not dare to regard ourselves as mentors, we are very willing to enlighten each other with an attitude of mutual learning.</p>
<p>▲ Announcement Regarding the modern celebrity calligraphy and painting works published in this publication, no payment is provided. The regulations for soliciting celebrity calligraphy and paintings have already been published, but it is feared that they have not been fully understood. We hereby reiterate this and hope that readers will understand.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (15)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(Brother, sister is here.)</p>
<p>(Who?)</p>
<p>(Uncle's daughter, the sister from home.)</p>
<p>For the past two months, I have been busy with the affairs of the society, and after writing to her, I no longer remembered her. Tonight, Sister Hui came suddenly, and I stood up in doubt. Sister Min was sitting on the opposite side of the desk, tilting her head and sending a mocking, charming glance. There was not enough time for me to hesitate, and my cousin had already jumped in with large strides. Wearing a white linen cheongsam, white canvas sneakers, and a face tanned slightly dark by the sun, set against her short, beautiful hair, she was completely different from when I saw her on the tram last time. Sister Min rushed to greet her in the courtyard and held Sister Hui's hand, saying:</p>
<p>(We haven't seen each other for so many years.)</p>
<p>Of course, Sister Hui could not recognize Sister Min, whom she had parted with when she was little. She frowned in confusion, unsure how to deal with this affectionate woman. I quickly said:</p>
<p>(Sister Hui, this is Sister Min, our friend from when we were little.)</p>
<p>(Oh, Sister Min, it really has been many years.)</p>
<p>They both smiled and walked into the room, sitting down on the sofa and talking about what had happened since they last met. I asked about my uncle and, seeing that I couldn't interrupt, buried myself under the lamp again to organize my manuscript. After a while, Sister Hui suddenly seemed to notice her younger brother and asked:</p>
<p>(Xin-di, when did you come to Shanghai, why haven't you come to our house?)</p>
<p>(Brother and Sister Min came to Shanghai first, I came a few days later.) Xin-di leaned against Sister Min's side and said.</p>
<p>(We met on the train and learned that Ping-di didn't get along with his stepmother. I said I couldn't leave Xin-di alone in the countryside, so I wrote to ask him to come to Shanghai.) Only after hearing Sister Min's explanation did I look up. Sister Hui was facing me, as if she was saying to me:</p>
<p>(You should have brought Xin-di out with you, he's still so young!) Sister Hui said with a smile, but it was so unnatural.</p>
<p>Sister Min couldn't come up with a response for a moment. I couldn't add any more explanations.</p>
<p>My younger brother looked at Sister Min's face, then turned back to look at me. Just then, Little Huang burst in from outside, and my younger brother jumped out and said:</p>
<p>(Mr. Huang, are you from the French concession?)</p>
<p>(A love triangle, you're making jokes too.)</p>
<p>Ever since I recounted (Dream Talk), Little Huang had been using "love triangle" as a synonym for the three of us. The people in my society had also grown accustomed to it, but today's "love triangle" in the uncomfortable air seemed even more serious. Little Huang walked into the room and, seeing a strange female guest sitting there, scurried upstairs.</p>
<p>Originally, there was nothing to say, but now there was even less to say. I lowered my head, trying to avoid Sister Min's and Sister Hui's gazes. Sister Hui stood up and said:</p>
<p>(I still have to go to a friend's house. Sister Min, younger brother, come to my house when you have time.)</p>
<p>I wanted to say something, but Sister Hui had already stepped out of the courtyard.</p>
<p>Sister Min and I looked at each other, feeling as if someone was urging me to explain to her. I quickly chased after her out the door.</p>
<p>(Sister Hui...)</p>
<p>A rickshaw carrying that short-haired head disappeared to the north.</p>
<p>Miss Twenty-Six is Sick</p>
<p>I felt like I had lost something I couldn't remember, and with a heavy heart and heavy footsteps, I walked into the house. There was no one in the house. I piled the manuscripts aside, lit a cigarette, and thought about the events of a few minutes ago. In the letter I wrote to Sister Hui two months ago, I only mentioned the reason why I couldn't live at my uncle's house, and that I resolutely left my family and came to Shanghai to do something. I didn't mention Sister Min or Xin-di. Sister Hui's sudden visit tonight was undoubtedly well-intentioned, but in the current situation, the suspicious and jealous nature of women was an undeniable fact, and Sister Min's wording made it an even stronger piece of evidence. Although I don't love Sister Hui, I can't bear to make her suffer for my sake; I almost wanted to go to her house immediately to explain everything.</p>
<p>I threw away the cigarette butt. My younger brother came down from upstairs and said: (Sister Min is crying.)</p>
<p>I ran up to the third floor. Her bedroom door was locked, and I knocked and called for her, but even the lights in the room were turned off. Helpless, I went to my own bedroom. Little Huang grabbed my hand and said: (Qingping, forgive me!) She looked at me apologetically, and I felt sorry for her instead.</p>
<p>(Little Huang, it's not your fault.)</p>
<p>(It's just that I like to joke around!)</p>
