<p>馬占山將軍已將其所收慰勞捐數目。開列淸單。正式公布矣。數月來所傳關於此項捐欵之種種消息。至此得一事實之證明。以全國人民節衣縮食。甚至毁家抒難所集之捐欵。據傳有二千萬元左右之多。而馬將軍實際收到者。僅一百七十餘萬元。不及十分之一。其十分之九以上。竟不知落於誰何之手。此不僅欵項着落之問題。實今日人心陷溺之程度之所表見也。</p>
<p>中國人民。受歷來事實之敎訓。對於輸欵濟公之事。頗知愼重從事。蓋急公好義之人。不難犧牲其家財。而犧牲之結果。會有若干實惠。及於所欲濟助之人殊不可知。此類疑問。旣由事實而發生。自不能不使熱心之人。有所警戒。亘三年之西北大旱災。遍及十六省區之二十年大水災。必待朱慶瀾之出而辦賑。義捐始集者。非無故也。九一八事件旣起。舉國憤痛。聞馬占山將軍於龍江起抗日之師。婦孺俱奮。慰勞之欵。不待募而集。其時經收欵項者。多爲國人所信任之機關或個人。其捐欵之收匯。經手者亦頗能愼重。以昭信用。不料在如此情形之下。尙有捐欵十分之九以上。下落不明。此又給與熱心輸欵之愛國人民以若何之刺戟乎。</p>
<p>今日之亟務。在經手收匯捐欵各機關。速起而爲自動之總檢查。馬占山將軍之通告請各捐欵人。自行根究。惟事實上。捐欵之個人。絕少自行直接匯欵慰勞者。各經手機關。受捐欵人之委託疑案旣生。爲委託者之捐欵着落計。爲自身之信用計。均不能憚檢查之煩。不速起而切實根究也。此事宜由經手捐欵較多之機關發起。成立一聯合辦事處。先行查明某機關經手收匯者若干。確有着落者若干。其無着落之欵。即向銀行郵局。查明欵究何往。好在此項慰勞捐欵。不特銀行郵局依一定之手續匯寄。即經手機關亦多事前知應愼重。有縝密之手續。將來水落石出。責任所在。不難查明。總檢查之舉本非甚難。惟視各經手機關之自愛與决心如何耳。</p>
<p>昔在洪楊戰爭之時。彭麗生致書曾國藩。論當日不可救藥之端。在人心陷　絕無廉恥。今日國難中之人心如何乎。吾人將於慰馬捐欵總檢查之結果見之。</p>

<p>日人爲欲打　中國工商業戰勝歐美工商業起見、故以利用傾銷爲唯一手段、但有許多貨品、爲成本所限、無法减輕、故在閩粤一带、利用複雜的外商關係、勾結華人、組織大規模漏稅機關、藉以减輕關税、低落貨本、海關防不勝防</p>

<p>日人又爲廣求銷路起見、以貸貨賤價兩種、誘勸華商敗類及漢奸爲其設立推銷機關、掛中國商店招牌、在上海有十餘家之多、漢口·九江·靑島·濟南·福州·廣州·等處、各有數家及十數家不等、其辦法非常便利、如向該號購進日貨一百元者、另貼保險費五元、由該號負責代爲運抵至目的地、如在半途或在目的地起卸、爲抗日會所破獲者、此項損失由該號承認照數賠償、即多至數萬數十萬元、亦無異言、交保水火險尤爲信用昭著、一般冷血商人、莫不趨之若騖、而日貨遂得暢銷、</p>

<p>該建議書首述火災及爆炸之原因、略謂、橡膠廠使用多量之揮發油、作爲橡膠之溶劑、致發生火災之機會頗多、使用是項溶劑之部分、其主要者爲混槳部·塗漿部·貼鞋部·塗漆部·等、本市各橡膠廠所使用之溶劑爲汽油、倘任其蒸發、則空氣中所含該項蒸發氣達一定限度後、遇有火花火熖等存在時、卽可爆炸、氣體之爆炸、須具有兩種條件、㈠氣體與空氣之混合達一定之比率、㈡有適當之熱源、具有高温度使該項氣體着火、此兩種條件、同時存在時、卽能引起爆炸、餘如電氣裝置、物體相攀、靜電生花、熬製火漆、壓力容器等、隨時皆有起火爆炸之可能、</p>
<h3 id="c125">防火原則 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>繼言防禦火災之原則、有㈠減少汽油之蒸發、㈡室内須有適當之煥氣、以排出汽油之蒸發氣、㈢避免火星火花等之發生、㈣廠屋之構造佈置、亦須注意、使一室發生火災後、不致延及他室、且於發生災變之際、工人須能於短時間内、逃至安全地點、</p>

<p>春秋酸葡萄哲學  林濚　　從前有一隻還算聰明的狐狸，這一天，看見一架熟透了的葡萄，得垂涏三尺；可惜架子太高，百計不能到手；向着葡萄望了半天，只得無精打彩的走了開去，自已欲安慰着自已道：「那葡萄一定還酸得很呢！」　　這叚新聞流傳到人間，有些人便學會了一種聊以自慰或解嘲的方法。例如某甲單戀久久，毫無結果，只得罷手；罷手自然不甘，便會竭力從那夢寐不忘的女人身上導出某些缺點。又如舉子落第，便假設榜上題名也許會發生某種不幸；財迷望見黄金而無以得之，便也會照幾聲銅臭。　　這種方法，久而久之，便形成了一種頗有權威的生活哲學，或處世哲學。這哲學可以名爲自解哲學；如果要追溯到那來歷，便可以呌做「酸葡萄哲學」這名字就活潑得多了。　　今日之酸葡萄哲學，好像在古老的中國特别發達。原來悠遠的封建社會之聖賢一向便以「忍」敎人，而造成了中國人之普遍的善於自安。到了今日，例如東四省淪亡之後，許多人還要搖頭搖尾道：「這正是中國人的好敎訓呢！」講這話的人自然不主張快快抗爭，而主張十年生聚之類，另外一些人聽了此話也便不暇思索的做那十年生聚之類的偉業去了。酸葡萄哲學發展到這般地步可謂猗歟盛哉。　　這般說來，酸葡萄哲學是弱者自慰哲學，是貪求者的解嘲哲學，同時是狡者的愚民哲學；統而名之，則爲自欺欺人哲學。　　說到弱者之以酸葡萄哲學聊以自慰，絶不能如唯心論者般解釋爲心理缺陷，而正是社會有以造成之。因爲社會太不平等，所以許多人處處受壓迫，不能有正當的自我發展，而終於只得拿酸葡萄哲學自解了，這裏，這葡萄而且舊了。可是我們相信世界終究會好。的那時無論是自欺或欺人的哲學都會消滅。炎夏散記  黄影呆　　「啊呀」？…冰啊！…冰要喂冰啊……賣冰的孩子們，在烈日之下，馬路之中，高喊着同様的賣冰聲，他們走過的時候，總是在來不及的奔跑怕的是冰要溶化啊！　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　在那邊的角子上，一個賣報的老頭子，冬天，太陽整日的曬在他身上，如果不是雨雪天呢，不穿皮裘，也正和高樓中的圍爐者同様的温暖，可是這幾天，糟糕，火一般的太陽曬得他頭上幾乎要出火了。　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　鴿龍式的屋子裏，風一些也吹不着太陽老是逼着你，裏面眞不能住人了，走吧，到那裏去？還是隔壁的弄堂裏，曬不着太陽，吹得着輕風，坐在矮凳上談天說地，誰說不是莫于山第二？　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　在中午的時節，雖是在熱閙的南京路上，行人也稀少了許多。摩登女士，時裝少年，不知匿跡在何處，怕是太陽要曬黑皮膚吧，不到夜晚是不肯輕易的出來吧！　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　前天因爲有些事情出去，喊了一輛黄包車回來，車夫在烈日中狂奔，已是奔得滿頭大汗，他對我說，夏天拉車，上面有太陽的逼曬，下面有柏油　脚底，再苦是没有，我聽見了非常的不忍，到寓下車，多給了幾個銅子他，也算是表示我的同情啊！　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　隔弄小樓的一角，望去有幾個妙齡的少女，整個的午後，坐在電風傘下，聽的，有無綫電，留音機：吃的，是西瓜，冰汽水，伊們的生活是多麽舒服，眞羨煞了窮措大呢，造物爲什麽是如此的不平等啊！散絃  葉奕願　　學校的門口，有雨爿商店，可以保發大財的：一是洗衣作，再一是食物館。　　學校裏休息十分鐘的時間内，有兩處地方是最擁擠的：一是小便處，一是消費合作社。　　有許多學生，在平時雖不用功；然而在大便時，總得要拿本小說來解解閒。此之可謂中國新靑年的特有的一點藝術。　　鄉下姑娘，到大都市裏來讀了半年的書，回去時，在伊的衣食住行方面，一定可以故試得出，伊是曾經趕過了一次大革命！　　讀書是要靜的。從前有一個先生對我說：「你讀書不要發出聲來，因爲發出聲來，就等於出了氣。老酒出了氣，等於屁；讀書而出了氣，也是得不到益處的啊」！東北四連長  張恨水　　第十二回　寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍　犧牲甘解甲戰士多情　　盛世民又說，在軍營裏當軍官，至少當了營長以上的官，上了陣線，不會安全些。若說連排長，那是和弟兄們一様的受罪。排長是不必說，打起仗來，他带着一排人，先上前。連長也是緊緊的跟着三排人。打起仗來，有正正的全旅全團不回來的，連長那兒安全得了？江氏道：不打仗，没有功勞，那裏升得了官？盛世民道：勸人去當兵的，總是說可以升官發財。其實幾萬人裏頭，才挑出一個師旅長來，除了自已要有那能耐外，還要命運高，上個十次二十次火線，才有升大官的希望。别說上了火線，那槍砲子彈打得天上是火，地下是煙，在火線上有個三天四天的話，耳朶都會震聾。兩三天不吃飯，兩三天不喝水，那是極平常的事。我也想破了，不幹也罷。我們八塊錢餉，折成六塊四毛錢，還要四五十天發一回，扣了火食，能買雙襪子，捎一封家信，就算不錯。所以當大兵的人，七八年不回去，那是常事。你呌他拿什麽臉子回去？這些話說得江氏默然無言。這天晚上，江氏一人睡在坑上，仔細想了一想，聽說連長是六十塊錢薪水，二十塊錢辦公費。若是打個八折，只好六十四塊錢，又要拿錢出來辦公，又要扣火食，還是四五十天一回，一個月也就不過三十來塊錢罷了。自已的姑娘，無論是說性格兒，模様兒，和他的能耐，那一様不是百裏挑一挑出來的。憑着這様的人不難道要挑一個掙二三十塊錢的姑爺，還找不出來嗎？你看，趕上定親，兩家都答應了，這是多要緊的時候。可是這位趙連長，倒在這個日子，遇上了總司令檢閱軍隊，抽不開身來。（一四六）普陀的梵音洞  衛術　　乘着　曲折的後山之山腰，足邊茸茸地長着野草之叢，來到梵音洞，是午前十一時。　　梵音洞之出名，奇妙傳說比之崢嶸的山色，是更其重要的，在那裏，有着會告訴人來生變作什麽的地方。　　洞在山麓洞底蓋有一座廟，進得山門，要越過百十砐下行的石級。途中樹一禁止捨身投淵的木牌，立在那裏望峻峻的山巖下面，確乎是　惴然的。旣讓人曉得來生，又勸人不可妄求，又是什麽意思呢。　　越往下走，心就越是陰沉沉的，滿身一個洞，也像别的洞那麽凉快，黝暗，並没有什麽不相似的地方。　　某一個洞裏，有一尊肉身金讓的古佛，一個洞裏，佛的葫蘆裏會放出水來，一個洞裏，有一張口伸舌的獅子的頭面，别一個洞裏，却有一個爲佛所有的巨大的足印（？）想到這些，心裏也就釋然了。　　這就是普渡之爲普渡罷？我想。逰踪所至憶重慶  白廬　　一九二六年春間，爲着生活的驅使，從宜昌搭輪，漂流到重慶來。那湍急的河流，噬人的峻灘，曲折如羊腸小徑的三峽，有時從甲板上望山間村落裏的行人，小得像豆一様，石壁矗立着，可以彷彿想像出南京路沙遜巨厦，被從下面朝上望的姿勢，只是那裏没有它的整齊，面且靜得無以復加，傳到耳朶來的，只是斷續的舟子的邪許聲！問答聲！　　你從那裏，可以見到造化的神奇，宇宙的偉大，使你整個心靈，陶醉在摩天的怪石上，激湍如矢的緊流裏，所以縱然輪船在危險的波濤裏掙扎，借此賞玩美景也是値得的。　　經過四日的恐懼心，總算一路上，没有出過亂子，平安地到了重慶。　　重慶的風景，使我最系戀的，還是老君洞，洞在我們所住獅子山的上遊，也就在龍門浩以上，隔江正對太平門。在某個星期日晚上，由我雇得一小汽油船，乘了六人，從羊角灘逆流而上，水程七八里，費三十分鐘，因在漲水，所以很慢，到龍門浩，才走上陸地，拾石級而上，盤繞到半山，就看見老君廟的山門，從此左折右廻，各有殿宇，就山形鑿成平地，再建屋在上面，廟内有僧人百數，雜花叢生石間，時在仲夏，各院宇都陰森廣闊，凉生肘腋，暑氣全消，石壁上鐫南無阿彌陀佛六字，徑逾尋文，壁陡絕，那老君洞就在老君殿的後面，黝黑異常，深不見底，在殿前，俯瞰隔江太平門的建築，在平時以爲最高的；到此郤都來脚下了。于是我們恣情地曼聲歌唱，拿出預備下的食盒來，實行Ｐｉｅｎｉｃ，這種趣味，是永遠會深鐫在萝裏的，到現在已是八年的距離，雖然我又流浪在城裏，但還像是昨天所經過的事一様明顯呢。游南翔古猗園  沈卓然　　自古名園無不廢者。蓋人事變遷，世運升降，舉足以爲轉移，而園之興廢隨之。　　南翔者；卽古槎溪，而古猗以多竹著，與槎溪相毘爲二鄉，今獨以南翔稱，園名實本於此。夷考其初，則明崇禎間李司馬泡庵先生築以隱居嘯傲者也。　　淸師定南都，宏光出走，乃分兵徇蘇松太諸郡邑，泡庵先生慟宗社之邱壚，以遺黎起義，兵敗，遂及於難，因葬園中。　　事平後，園略被燬，泡庵後人亦零落殆盡，轉歸某氏所有，始稍稍復其舊觀。洎咸同間，洪楊亂起，再經兵燹，園益頽廢，無復主人，翔人公有之，游者無阻，其左偏小屋，且設茶尞，市人多所溷跡。　　今翔之紳耆，方以古蹟之保存與公園之建築爲急，聚爲謀之，更請於縣府，集資修葺，鳩工命匠，不日成之，此後當益有可觀游者。　　園枕槎溪，臨曠野，廣可數畝，繚以短垣，華而不過於奢，樸而不至於陋，徑路迂折，頗覺幽邃，想見昔人意匠經營之慘，非伊朝夕。　　亭榭樓館，錯落有致，其中土阜隆然，喬木交蔭，雜樹叢生，山石磅礴，蘼蕪滿地，登其高處，亦足遠眺，間以曲沼，上通浮梁，惜其水終年停滀，無由澄潔，舊蓋於此荷者也。　　池邊老樹，輒有古藤延附，或倒懸入水，或横引他木，蟋虬夭矯，莫可名狀，時當首夏，垂垂着花，如瓔珞然，粗者盈把，若小兒臂，疑百餘年物，余最愛之。</p>

<p>談借債  豈凡　　旣然誰也免不了有偶然緊逼，世界上就不能没有借債一事。或者因爲有擴充事業的企圖，於是吸收外資以實行其計劃，或者因爲創建新事業，借一宗欵項作爲資本，這是有作爲的借債。在上海却有人以借債爲職業而度日的，他不是爲度過一時的難關而借債，借債是他生活的技能，平常借了債是預備還的，而在他的心目中借了就不必還。這種借債，當然很特别而稀少，我們還是談平常一般的借債。　　在中國的舊家庭裏，兒子借債老子還錢的事很多，而且是常常成爲家庭糾紛的大原因的。放債人看見那家資產尙富有，子弟却無賴，有不怕父兄不出來淸理償還的把握，總很慷慨出借的。借的人只要有錢到手可以化用，什麽利害他是不顧的，苦恨的自然只有將代他淸償的父兄了。這一半也是父兄不肯把一家的情形公開，使他們的子弟自恃家中富有而不怕借債，但也有身當一家重任而敢借債亂用的，那却是敗家之兆。　　這一種家庭，中國現在也很多，大抵祖宗留給他們的遺產太多了，傳給他們的生活技能太少了，他們只能吃飯遊戲而不能做工，於是專吃祖宗之遺產，不足，便繼之以借債．他們有祖傳的產業，當然是體面人家，但借債不能管你的體面，總得拿房地產以及其他權益作抵押的。這時將使他感覺到一點有傷自已的尊嚴，但後來房地產由債主經手管理之後，成績反比委之自已的賬房好，於是又放心了，又肯安心大借債了。　　借慣了債，便永遠要借下去，永遠不能停止，借的人已不知債之要還的了。可是他並不像上海的特别借債人，安心不還而借的，在他實在有點莫明其妙，只要有錢可借，借來化用了再說。當他是一家之主時，問題是在借得來之後如何分配，大兒子多少，二女兒若干，要公平分配，大家化用，否則又要起家庭風波，至於如何還，他並未打算過。　　倘使借債可以不想到如何償還，如同有祖遺田宅作抵的體面人家，借債也確是過日子的一種方法，但請在分配上留意一下，不要在家庭中間再閙出人命案來。　　寫到這裏不禁想起了美國借給我們的棉和麥。古文觀止與ＡＢＣ  侍桁　　記得前幾年的進步的敎授，看見大學校的大學生還在以「古文觀止」當作聖經似地讀，便不免有許多感慨，而覺得中國民族的無希望。　　這兩年來，從這一點上講，中國民族也許眞是進步了，大學生已經不再讀「古文觀止」。但代替着「古文觀止」的，是什麽讀物呢？簡而言之，是ＡＢＣ一類的書。　　ＡＢＣ的種類頗多，有「文學的ＡＢＣ」，「哲學的ＡＢＣ」，「科學的ＡＢＣ」以及「社會科學的ＡＢＣ」；類似ＡＢＣ之類的書籍也不少，如「文學入門」，「書信作法」，「小說作法講義」以及「愛情書信講義」；其次還有什麽「窗前隨筆」，「床上隨筆」之類。　　在如今這時代，一切都應當講經濟，找捷徑，自是天公地道的事。在普遍地以不讀書爲原則的學生界中，有人肯省下看影戲吃巧格力的錢來買ＡＢＣ，那不也算是優秀的份子麽？而且據說，讀了「文學的ＡＢＣ」便可理解文學，讀了「科學的ＡＢＣ」便可理解科學，爲什麽自已還要發痴，耗費寳貴的金錢，讀幾百頁的而結果並不見得就能給自已带來怎様的實利的笨書呢。　　從前的學生讀「古文觀止」，是因爲一觀而便可以不必再觀了，所以它才流行；如今的學生讀ＡＢＣ，是因爲一讀了ＡＢＣ便算對於某種學問具有心得，而可以高談闊論甚至作爲難敎授的資料了。至於我們的書店老闆，當然是看着洋錢作生意的，爲迎合時好而特約名人大批地印行ＡＢＣ，也正是生財有道不失爲進步的商人的。　　從中國學生讀「古文觀止」轉換到ＡＢＣ，無論如何也算是中國民族的進步了，因爲「古文觀止」還是一種極廣汎的東西，而ＡＢＣ則成爲學術的分類的研究了；然而中國民族倘總是這様地進步的話，她的前途該是多麽可以樂觀的啊！兩種蟲類  唐弢　　夏秋的時候，街頭巷尾常有呌賣鳴蟲的，聶普遍的兩種，是呌哥哥和知了。　　呌哥哥屬於螽斯一類，色綠。混跡在豆棚瓜架中，擇肥而噬，吃飽了肚子没有事做，便放開聲音高唱一番；雖說唱的並不是嘴，而是嘴以外的另一種東西，但充溢在他們聲音裏的，據說都是天經地義般的大道理。　　就因爲是大道理，所以那麽的玄妙，那麽的不可理解，我們全聽不懂！生在同一世界上，同爲萬物之一，但他們是他們，我們是我們，他們所唱的是本身利益問題，和我們没半點關係。　　他們唱著，從早晨到夜晩，又從夜晚到早晨，所唱的終是這些老話！終是這一套！　　似乎天之所以生呌哥哥，就在使他們唱，使他們無禆於大衆的高聲地唱。　　他們另外還有一種本領，那便是跳。從這枝上跳到那枝上，又從那枝上跳回來，或者跳到别的甚麽地方：他們的目的是在使肚子飽，享樂和舒齊，以及盡量的發揮他們的唱的天才。　　至於知了，郤另有不同的腦子。他鄙夷呌哥哥的行爲，而以淸高自命：雖然肚子也一様的吃得飽飽，據說只是些「於世無虧，於人無損」的露水。　　知了喜歡把赭灰色的身體隱在樹幹裏，放出「正人君子」般的雍容的架子，冷笑著别人的昏　貪吝；只有他們才是聰明的，他們甚麽都知道。可是他郤是一個時代的旁觀者。　　爲著妬忌呌哥哥的得據肥枝，他們也常高聲呌唱。那是另一種聲音，另一個調子，唱來像是更爲動聽的。　　然也只是唱唱而已。　　時代不需這種蟲類！可是現在這世界，正是充滿著這兩種蟲類的世界。文人們  何毅天　　一大批「不得不」離開中學大學的文人，在三四千人流汗的鬥爭中「幸運地」考進軍官學校來了。一大批的平頭，拿破崙頭，海軍頭，已經在一個廣埸上很可惜地剃光了。西裝脫下來了。學生服脫下來了。長袍子脫下來了。玳瑁邊的眼鏡也脫下來了。在集合塲上，一長列　腫不堪的棉軍服的小白臉都站在那黄黄的太陽下了。　　一個斜掛紅布带的隊長喊一聲：「聽着！」　　立刻就可以聽見那不願意或者弄不慣的立正的脚聲，險長的肩頭皺了。一個師傳的威嚴様子也擺出來了：　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　··「文人眞没辦法！」隊長带兵多年了，内戰也打得不少；平時的兵喊立正就立正，戰時的兵喊殺就殺。然而隊長從來没带過「文人」；「文人」眞没辦法。　那些「文人」在列子裏忍不住然而却是　着嘴笑了。　　然而煩瑣的事情開始了。　　隊長從軍帽說到軍服，說到領章，說到腰皮带，說到褲子，說到裏腿，說到皮鞋。裏腿有兩種打法：一順的打和打人字。人字也有兩種：大人字和小人字。不要太鬆，也不要太緊。至於皮鞋則在每天穿過之後，用乾布擦凈皮鞋面的灰塵，用小刀子刮盡皮鞋底的泥土，再用濕布仔細擦。大家想：麻煩呀！　　接着是入伍訓練：　　「敬禮數丨丨一！」　　「一Ⅲ」一長排的右手都平平向前伸直，白手掌都微微彎曲。　　「二！」　　「二Ⅲ」一長排伸直的右手都向上彎曲，手掌都和帽簷靠攏了。　　「一！」手又伸直了。　　「二！」手又垂下來了。　　「一！」「二！」「一！」「二！」………　　他們這些文人都懂得：這就是軍長要把那些複雜的頭腦訓練成機械，訓練成服從，訓練成喊殺就殺，訓練成搜山的獵人養的那東西·晚上在寢室裏又可以聽見滿屋子抱着光頭歎息的聲音。　　有一個怕羞的同學在街上忘了給隊長敬體，又把列子集合起來了。隊長拿着一根一尺長的紅木板，吆喝着站在他面前的那同學。文人們都感着侮辱了。一個同學流着淚站出列子去，白手掌在帽簷擱一下。　　「报告隊長！　廢除這様的刑罰。軍長那天行開學禮的時候，還說我們都是從學校出來的，需要特别待遇。」　　列子裏面有了鼻子抽搐的聲音。但是隊長並不曾動點色，揚起那根紅木板喊道：　　「難道軍長呌你們不服從他嗎？只要你們愛面子，這東西總不會跑到你們的身上來！」　　終於在許多歎息聲中，一根紅木板在一個白手掌上拍拍地打了。　　第二天就私逃了幾個。　　幸而文人們都善忘，何况大家旣爲了金領章「不得不」考進來，當然現在也「不得不」在歎過氣後，仍然在操塲上，在太陽下，在口令聲中「一二」「一二」的下去了。平凡的事（二九）  𣽃果孫　　「唔……」之光没有說完，伯唐已經說了一聲：「可不是詫異！」　　這句話剛好說完，忽然他們的聽官像是登時豁然貫通了似地，辨出了眞地有大砲聲音。佩萸指着窗外說：　　「這是甚麽！……聽見嗎？」　　伯唐並不回答，連忙立起來去開那合　北的玻璃門，接着大家都走到門外那道玻璃廊邊，把廊邊的玻璃窗子和窗子外面的百葉窗子打開好幾扇，張起耳朶聽，並且張起耳朶去細聽。　　實際上，這時候那砲聲已經不必靜聽就很顯然了，不過他們的目的並不單在砲聲之有無。而在砲聲之所自來以及砲聲中的差别。漸漸地，他們辨出異同了：「轟隆轟隆」是從遠處來的，一面聽到耳朶裏，一面像是遠處的空氣簡直跟着這種聲音一層一層擴成圈子再散開來；「朋朋」是從近處來的，只須聽見「朋」的一聲，登時覺得自已脚底下的支點也跟着閃動一下，然而空氣却像是不生震波似的。這兩種巨帮，像是更番地鎭住了一切其他的「必必八八」和「閣閣閣」的連續閙聲，而使聽者心中只有一個由許多黑身巨口的怪獸對着吐火噴光所成的獰惡活劇。　　這種獰惡活劇，究竟是在那一國的領土之内開演呢？伯唐的心裏已經怦怦的了。　　他們也和這半月以來住在上海那些關心戰事的人一様，曉得近處的砲聲是我們的，遠處的是敵人的，結果，誰都明白只要近處有砲聲，就可以證明閘北還在我們那幾萬抗敵愛國的健兒手裏；然而他們今天在這一带北窗跟前聽得的感覺，似乎已經由簡單的進而爲錯綜的了；近處的砲聲固然和遠處的相應，可是近處的遠不及遠處的來得那様密，來得那様强，並且他們又都想起那個工兵組長的命令和勸告了，因而悟及今晚的惡戰，一定是敵人早已計畫停當的第一次總攻，方法就是先用强大的火力來破壞我們閘北的陣地，呌我們無從扼守。當然這情形是很嚴重的了！尤其是迤北一带那片　住半天的紅光，眞呌他們忘記了自已究竟立在甚麽地點。　　末了，之光向伯唐說：　　「你聽，伯唐，我們的砲聲雖然來得連地都震動了，可是遠不及他們的密！」　　「不錯，我也早就覺得了！」　　「我們爽性拿出表來測一下罷！」　　他們經過了十五分鐘的測騐，曉得兩方面發砲的次數，是二與十七之比了，而砲力的强弱，還絕没有方法可以比較出來。之光丢開了測騐的工作嘆息地說：　　「到明天，我今天見過的那些東西和那些人，又不曉得會變成甚麽？……伯唐，你看，那」不是一片緋紅的火光？」　　「你才想明白嗎！」伯唐瞪着眼大聲向他說，「明天以後，也許連我們自已也不曉得會變成甚麽？要是大家不一齊努力，也許滅亡的大禍就是這様開始……」　　這眞呌之光詫異了，他所詫異的，不是伯唐的思想，而是伯唐的態度·他覺得伯唐已經陡然變了態度了，正想問他，他却繼續往外說：　　「之光，在這様驚心動魄的活劇之下，我更明白大家的事非大家担戴不可，同時，我也悟」到了你今天在閘北所得的那種……所得的那種憂僨！現在我决定把廠裏的一切接濟閘北，揀可以用得的東西儘量接濟，這様或許心安一點！」　　之光覺得這是若有神助的事了，也瞪着眼睛望着伯唐，伯唐又重複地說：　　「現在，我已經决定把廠裏的一切接濟閘北，揀可以用得的東西儘量接濟，這様究竟心安一點！」</p>

<p>談言　　　　　　　　　　　　　　人心很古  吾　　近來常聽得人嗟聲嘆氣的說：「人心不古」，少不了是慨嘆世道日衰，道德日微。這様的古道熱腸，大槪不是完全没有道理的。譬如說罷，綁票匪層出不窮，甚至於坐了鋼板汽車在白俄保鏢簇擁之下的大肚皮也會綁將過去。此外四馬路的野雞雖然幾乎絕跡，可是大世界旁邊總還是拉拉扯扯的來㖸來㖸。這等現狀，在明眼人看來，雖然知道是現實的經濟機構中不會缺少的現象，同時也是現代社會最好的裝飾品，特别是在崩潰的過程中，更其平常更爲眞實的暴露。但是在道學先生透過銅框眼鏡的看來，到底是不勝感慨係之，爲的是堯天舜日的聖朝早已過去，而現在祇落得如此這般。所以唯一的辦法只好復古。假如眞能夠做到這一層，那末人心也就會跟着古起來，這大槪是完全不成問題的。　　然而復古一道，也頗不易，譬如要回復到堯舜時代，必需先要有眞龍天子出世，然後才能一步一步的復過去，但是人心不古的人到底很多，濟南府的天地人三皇還不是給不肯誠心復古的人破滅了。宣統皇帝雖然早已登基，但還不是被人們駡爲傀儡，看上去不見得就能萬古千秋。至於如老狗鄭孝胥之類所滿口吹嘘的王道政治，固然使好些善人君子喜得心花怒放，幾乎想跨過山海關而登天庭，以做有道明君的順民。可是這也不像心裏所想的那般容昜。因爲總怕被人駡爲漢奸。即算不承認是直接的賣國求榮，但事實上總是投降了叛逆，而且是「僞」國的臣民，面子很過不去也。　　旣然如此，熱心復古的人，必須另想方法，最好是談話中或是筆尖下哀然長鳴，甚至於肆意謾駡。例如幾天前我偶然論了一下女人，居然有人做文章駡我是「大義滅親」，最大的理由是說我傷及了自已的母親。關於這位老先生是否也讀得懂文章？我想在這裏不必置論。可是他那種感慨世道日衰的神氣是可以看得出來的。所以我並不想在「文人無行」的一點上來多說話，我只覺得他們一心復古的苦心，的確可敬亦復可憐。　　由此可知，道德淪亡，大槪不自今日始，而是現在更加亡得不堪收拾罷了，這由於此等銅框眼睛居然瘋癲似的捨身衛道，便可見時代的狂流的確將他們打得頭暈眼花了。　　即就「論女人」一文而言，明眼人自會知道我並没有所謂侮辱女性的意念，正如板起面孔來維持風化的人們正是色情狂的一様，對着和尙駡賊秃，總不免要惱羞成怒的。這一怒非同小可，於是不口誅而筆伐，下筆成章，於是嘻笑顏開，心滿意足。而其功德也就値得豎石牌坊。　　這様看來，所謂人心不古，從此應一變而爲「人心很古」了嗚呼哀哉！我知之矣。麥克層下的女性  文　　近來楊少奶感到生活的單調，也許是眞的。　　她每天的生活日課，都跳不出吃喝，睡覺與玩的三道漩渦。雖在終年不得一飽的貧民想來，吃喝該是人生第一大快事；而楊少奶却感到大菜西點，海味山珍，簡直都像糙米草根似的不適口。睡在彈簧床上，反側之間，也往往感到皮肉不貼適，而且睡得多了，體態更怪慵慵的，小事體也愛生氣冒火。至於說到玩，本是比較不易厭倦的，從五點半散戲歸來，如果想透一口淸新的空氣，便可坐了汽車往郊野去兜兜風，然後看是怎様一種心情，想興奮一下神通麽，儘可去玩哥而夫球，回力球，碰了巧，還可平添十萬百萬的財富，若是胸口煩膩，便上京戲園，聽聽大班小班，話劇淸唱，皆能怡神定心，有飄飄若仙之槪。跳舞雖很勞神，究竟有某種誘惑，疲乏之中飽含有興奮的成分。然而這些楊少奶是皆覺得乏趣了，别人若道及此中快樂，她便要蹶起小小的櫻唇說：「也都不過是那麽一回事？」　　總之，楊少奶是極度感到生活的疲乏了，需要一種超生活的調濟。　　「德林，我眞不知怎麽這様愁，我們到外國去玩玩好麽？」她臥在沙發上，右手挽住挨臥着的丈夫的頸項，嬌滴滴的這麽說。　　「只恐事實辦不到，丢下這些公司工廠呌誰來照應呢？」德林繼續着說：「本來你的生活委實太單調了，最好是拿部分精力來做件事業看看！」　　「想，我也曾這麽想過，不過幹什麽好呢？」　　「王家的大太太就是個様兒，她開爿絲綫廠賺了，現在又開時裝公司了，只要資本雄厚些，就有把握，我想你也好學着來幹一套！」　　「嗆，那麽平庸的事，修德，我眞不要幹！」　　「那麽，你自已想想，到底幹什麽好呢？」　　「吾，有，我是有一件事情想幹，丨就是開爿牙籤廠，這是我兩年前就想到了的。上等人，吃完了飯，誰不需要他？若是出品比市上的精雅些，這生意準不會弱於開爿時裝公司！而且這事業是多麽高貴淸閒，我就想幹，德林，你看怎様？」　　　「也好，你就去開辦吧！旣然有這麽一種興致。」　　於是楊少奶在銀行裏支取了大筆欵子，把近郊的一座洋房改成工廠，招進了大批女工，女工都是鄕下來路貨，個個心带驚奇：第一是城裏怎麽有這種女人物，女廠長；第二是做的生活却是這麽一種怪賤怪不實用的東西，要說她是火柴棍，却有一端是尖扁的，而且爲什麽不在本廠上藥呢？牙籤牙籤，走遍城裏，都不見有這東西，烟紙店裏没有買得，攤頭上也說不出這牌名，也不見有人吃了飯就用這東西籤牙？　　然而年終楊少奶向大衆宣稱：「銷路頂好，這是諸位的福運，要滋長這福運，便全靠諸位自已努力，所以有加長工作時間至每日十二小時的必要！」玻璃盃的戀愛  平遐　　玻璃盃，熱手巾，銅壺，開水，代代花，菊花，茶葉……給加上阿雲的眉眼，微笑，於是每天晚上吸引了各式各様的男人來。他們，全是了性的飢渴病患者，摸一摸阿雲的手也會得到異常的快感的。　　阿雲就利用着媚眼，微笑，玻璃盃，熱手巾……儘受着男人們的玩弄，調笑，博取她和一家子七口的生活費。阿雲明白，親手把自已的靑春生活推進了垃圾箱去了，但是，没辦法自家兒旣没有做富家小姐的好命，也没有當富家少奶奶或者姨太太的機花運；自已，一家子七口，飯要吃，衣要着，屋子要住的。阿雲當了游戲塲裏的女茶役，給游客們當作說說笑笑，或者就是動手動脚尋趣味的對象，阿雲想，譬如當站在暗街的角落裏等候嫖客的妓女，終還幸福得多。而且，說上口來，也可以扮一副正經臉，「我是賣茶不賣身子的。」　　譬如，色迷迷的小玉這一個月來已經化上了八十多塊錢，可是終究不曾親到阿雲一個面孔。譬如人老心不老的褚先生，羅先生，每天來泡兩盃代代花菜，給她一塊錢，還得每天請她吃點心，可在阿雲臉上没有笑容的時候，連來一聲咳嗽也不大敢的，他們心裏的壞念頭，至少在最近是無從做起哩。又如姓張的，鼻子下面的幾根鼠鬚雖然常常做着勾引她的表演，而阿雲聰明地喚他做乾爺，這使姓張的滿腹邪念，只能在肚裏打轉了，而阿雲則常常可以問他要一兩塊錢來用。又如……那些在罪惡塲中經歷還不久的洋行小鬼們，祗要阿雲開口，買五六塊錢的一件衣料，是無有不送的，而當他們要求些什麽的時候，阿雲只要打一個謊，說「我是有丈夫的」就得。這是阿雲借着「戀愛」這東西做誘吊生活費的香餌的！　　可是，阿雲有着眞正戀愛的對象，那就是一個男茶役，專給幾個女茶役絞熱手巾的阿連。假如那些走馬王孫式的茶客們知道了一定會莫測高深的，而當阿連問她爲什麽不愛那些有錢化同時也肯化錢的茶客而愛他一個窮小子時，她說了：　　「這有什麽値得奇怪的！我當女茶役，是所謂玻璃盃，你當男茶役，是所謂熱手巾，是同類的；我愛你，你愛我，等於玻璃盃和熱手巾，在我們的生活裏是分不開的！」　　「我要愛那些茶客嗎，玻璃盃放進白玉金銀盃裏去，那是配與不配，就是某一個茶客能夠眞心愛我，我也爲了不配而不會接受的，何況他們全是大少爺化錢玩你的玩意兒。」　　阿雲倒是實行戀愛階級論者了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) A certain naval attaché of the Japanese army stationed in Taidao came to Beiping from Qindao this morning for negotiations. A portion of Shi Yousan's troops in Qindao already departed for Yutian last night. Liu Shisun is scheduled to come to Beiping tonight to report. Qian'an and Zunhua have not been taken over due to the rise of bandits. According to reports, there are already over a thousand puppet troops in Zunhua city, gathering at a certain station east of Tangshan to be transported out of the pass and sent to the Anfeng Line. The puppet troops in Qian'an county seat have not yet been reorganized as of yesterday. The new magistrate of that county, Lu Qingchen, is still滞留 in Tianjin. He has now been commissioned to lead police to prepare for the takeover. Dushan and Longxian, which are outside the Great Wall and relatively far away, cannot be taken over. Sun Weishan, the magistrate of Jixian, previously went there with the Japanese liaison officer Lin Wenxiang and has implemented the takeover. However, the Fourth Brigade of the puppet army is stationed there and has not yet left. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Beiping-Yuguan through train service, Yin Tong will negotiate with both the Garrison Army and the Kwantung Army, because the section from Tangshan to Yuguan falls within the jurisdiction of the Garrison Army. After reaching a satisfactory agreement in Tianjin, he will then proceed to Changchun. The detailed plan for the through train service has been discussed and decided with Qian Zongze, and he will carry the plan with him to negotiate with the Kwantung Army in the coming days. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) The so-called East Asia Allied Army of Li Shoushan is scheduled to begin being transported from Tangshan to outside the pass on the 4th. The Fengshan Railway is currently actively preparing carriages. After Li's troops are completely transported, the Kwantung Army and the Tangshan Garrison along the Beining-Tang-Yu line, as well as the Beining Line District Headquarters, will gradually withdraw outside the pass. The transport can be completed within ten days. At that time, the road rights between Tangshan and Yuguan will be actually returned, and the Beining Line will begin through train service without any other problems. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) The special reception train has returned to Tianjin empty, without carrying Shi's troops. Liu Shisun is scheduled to return to Beiping from Qinhuangdao for a visit within the next few days. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tangshan) The reception in Lulong County was completed on the 1st. The Public Security Bureau of Beidaihe is also in the process of being taken over. After Director Li Xianting went to take over, he encountered thorny issues and came to Tangshan on the 1st to meet with Commissioner Xue to resolve them locally before returning to his post. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the two northeastern war zones, except for the four counties of Qian'an, Zunhua, Jixian, and Pinggu, and the two administrative bureaus of Dushan and Xinglong, the remaining areas are to be managed by the county magistrates together with the local defense corps to clear the countryside, first to ensure local peace and tranquility, and then to implement relief efforts. In addition to bandits in Qian'an, there is also a mixed army occupying the area, still causing disturbances. It will require considerable effort to eliminate them. The puppet troops of Li Shoushan in Zunhua have already begun to be transported to Tangshan and Fengrun for reorganization and will be completely transported within three to five days, after which the takeover can take place. Jixian was previously taken over by Sun Weishan, but as of the 1st, there has been no report on whether or not the takeover has been completed, and it is impossible to determine. The situation in Pinggu is similar to that in Zunhua. Dushan and Xinglong are more complex and require negotiation. The Japanese side is not absolutely unwilling to hand them over. It is rumored that Dushan has been incorporated into the puppet state's territory and cannot be taken over, and that Xinglong will be incorporated into the jurisdiction of the Northeast, which is unreliable. (1st, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese troops in Yuguan are scheduled to withdraw within the week. The Linyu county government will move its office from Haiyang to Linyu after the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn. Liu Shaokun, the liaison officer stationed in Yuguan, returned to Tianjin from Yuguan on the 1st to report on everything. Although Miyun has been reluctantly taken over, the Japanese army is closely monitoring the actions of the new county magistrate. His entrances and exits are closely followed by Japanese soldiers, and all government orders must first be reported to the Japanese side. The former puppet magistrate is especially creating all sorts of difficulties and demanding outstanding debts urgently. The areas of Gubei and Shixia are currently occupied by the Japanese army and are also difficult to take over at present. There are currently over three thousand puppet troops in Jixian and Zunhua, who are currently being sent to Tangshan for dismissal. Only after this is completed can the takeover take place.

<p>[Indian Peace Cannot Be Achieved Through Non-Violence]</p>
<p>Leading Followers to Ras Village, Police Officers Arrived at Midnight, Calmly Surrendered</p>
<p>Ahmedabad Before Continuing the Individual Civil Disobedience Movement, Gandhi Published a Letter to the British People, Stating: [Indian peace can never be obtained from the government, nor can it be achieved by issuing orders. If the British people want peace in India, they should trust the National Congress. I deeply love the British nation, although some consider me an enemy, I dare to predict that they will one day realize that my request is justified. ] etc. (31st, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Ahmedabad Gandhi began a new movement of non-violent resistance, hoping to force autonomy through coercion. The Indian government has quickly dealt with it. Gandhi, his wife, his secretary, and thirty-two monks went to Ras Village in Kaira District to ask the villagers for cooperation. It is learned that they were arrested at 1:40 AM this morning and imprisoned in Sabarmati Prison. Rumors of Gandhi's imminent arrest have been rife in recent days. Gandhi dissolved the monastery he founded eighteen years ago last night to serve the truth. A prayer ceremony was held in the monastery last night, with many men, women, and children participating. Gandhi told them that the monastery had been destroyed and that its restoration depended on the will of the monks. The crowd was greatly moved by his words. The government disrupted the advance to Ras at the last minute, just as Gandhi's march to Dandi on March 12, 1930, to abolish the salt law. Gandhi was staying in the villa of the factory owner Das and was sound asleep when the county magistrate, police chief, and others arrived in four cars. The noise awakened Gandhi, who knew their intentions. He gathered his followers for a prayer ceremony and then went with the crowd. (1st, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Calcutta British Royal Air Force planes bombed Bajauri Village on the border between India and Afghanistan this morning because the tribal people refused to surrender three political prisoners who incited the overthrow of the Afghan government. British planes had previously scattered艾的美頓 leaflets, giving them 48 hours to surrender the three, or they would drop bombs. But the tribal people adhered to Islamic doctrine and refused to surrender them. It is heard that one of the three is the one who is requesting the Afghan throne. (1st, National Telegram)</p>

<p>Steel Industry Negotiates with Labor, Achieving Initial Victory</p>
<p>Automobile Industry Regulations Are Willing to Set an Example for the Nation</p>
<p>Retail Merchants Follow General Industry Regulations</p>
<p>Working Hours of Independent Farmers Not Restricted</p>
<p>(New York) The American steel industry has completely agreed with the American Federation of Labor today on the issue of joint negotiations and treatment of wages. Therefore, the industry can also join the American President's recovery plan. This is a major victory for the Recovery Administration and the labor community. When the industry submitted its regulations, it insisted that wage and treatment matters should only be negotiated with company unions, not with the American Federation of Labor. But today, Raymond, a leader of the steel industry, claimed that the companies have agreed to withdraw all provisions in the original regulations that should be negotiated with the company unions. A company union is a labor group of a company. The American Federation of Labor has been determined to overthrow this system and has been fighting for it for many years. Now the steel industry wants to take the opportunity to support this system, but it was stopped by the opposition of the labor union and the persuasion of the government. (31st, National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) It is expected that hundreds of thousands of people can obtain jobs due to the National Industrial Recovery Movement before the end of this week. But on several points, the recovery movement is now encountering a week of resistance. The negotiation of the oil industry regulations is about to be established because the New Jersey Mobil Oil Line supports the oil industry stabilization program proposed by the authorities. This morning, General Johnson, who is implementing the recovery plan, summoned labor and management in the steel industry to talk. The steel employers, who have always opposed outside groups such as the American Federation of Labor from organizing labor unions alone, today proposed a regulation specifically stipulating the organization of "company unions," advocating that workers from each company organize labor unions under the guidance of company staff. But the spokesperson of the American Federation of Labor criticized this system, and General Johnson and Raymond, chairman of the Steel Association, also supported the spokesperson of the labor union. Therefore, the employer side eventually withdrew the proposed clauses. This is the first victory for the labor side in this struggle. Steel workers can　choose their method of organizing a labor union in the future. However, Raymond claimed that employers will still strive to always contact labor through [company unions]. The regulations proposed by steel employers advocated 40 hours per week and a minimum wage of $15 per week. Labor Minister Perkins fought for the workers today, saying that 40 hours of work per week is too long and $15 per week is too low, and that the method of abolishing child labor is also insufficient. She advocated that the steel industry work six hours a day, five or six days a week. Automobile industry tycoon Ford has not yet signed the automobile industry regulations. Today, Ford claimed that Ford Motor Company is the role model for the regulations. If we want to abide by them, we must always abide by them. Members of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, numbering two million, will boycott merchants who refuse to comply with the recovery program at the request of the president. The authorities have now appointed Moffett, who resigned from the position of director of the New Jersey Mobil Oil Line in order to support the recovery movement, Harry, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, and Lund, president of the Manufacturers Association, as members of the Industrial Advisory Committee. Therefore, the strength of the authorities in handling the National Industrial Recovery Case is now even stronger. (31st, Reuters News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Johnson, the director of the American Industrial Recovery Administration, claimed today that the national retail industry will implement a national general industry regulation starting tomorrow. Since manufacturers have agreed to adopt a general industry regulation, the retail industry will naturally handle it in a unified manner. From now on, the working hours of all national employees, except for farmers, will be restricted. Farmers alone, because they are fighting against the weather, cannot have their working hours regulated. As for the retail industry, starting tomorrow, grocery store employees will work no more than eight hours per day, whereas previously many worked nine or ten hours. All retail food stores will be temporarily limited to 48 hours of work per week, and department stores, hardware stores, and other retail stores will be limited to 40 hours per week. The minimum wage per person will be $13 per week. However, what is being implemented tomorrow is a trial industry regulation that can be amended in the future. Opponents can report to the government the difficulties in complying so that they can be reviewed and handled. (31st, National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) The US Treasury ordered the addition of ten million yuan in banknotes tonight, that is, silver certificates made based on the silver of the war debt repaid by the UK. This silver was transported from the UK and India to the US and is now stored in the San Francisco Mint as part of the US treasury reserve. The Treasury has not yet announced the use of the newly printed currency. It is speculated that it will be used to cope with the federal government's current political expenses. According to current laws, the new silver certificates will be in the same position as other US currencies. In peacetime, the US Treasury holds and circulates about 500 million yuan in silver coins and silver certificates. For ordinary commercial purposes, silver certificates and gold certificates are not very different. Now that the gold standard has been abandoned, all currencies have the same value for the repayment of public and private debts. (31st, National Telegram)</p>

<p>Procedures for Handling Goods and Payments Quite Simple</p>
<p>(New York) An official of the Finance Rehabilitation Company stated today that the cotton and wheat purchased by China with loans will soon begin to be loaded and shipped. Japan has not protested to the United States regarding this matter. The Chinese government's purchasing agency here has leased houses near twenty exchanges to set up purchasing offices to engage in procurement. All wheat will be purchased in the western states of the United States, striving to be close to the Pacific coast to save on railway freight. Most of the cotton will be purchased in the south and shipped from the southern ports. All detailed procedures for purchasing goods with loans have now been agreed upon, and there should be no further complications to hinder progress. American ships will be used as much as possible for transportation. The Finance Rehabilitation Company is now prepared to make payments to warehouses and companies selling wheat and cotton immediately after receiving certificates from the Chinese purchasing offices. The purchasing and payment procedures are quite simple: the Chinese purchasing offices will directly contact the sellers, negotiate prices, and formally conclude transactions. Then, they will issue certificates, and the Finance Rehabilitation Company will make payments directly to the recipients based on these certificates, without going through the offices. The Chinese government has now hired several well-known cotton and wheat trade experts to assist in procurement. All purchased cotton and wheat will serve as collateral for the loans until they are handed over to the Chinese government. Insurance and freight costs will also be paid from this 50 million yuan loan. (31st National News Agency)</p>

<p>The Japanese Navy Acknowledges That Economic Blockade Against Japan by the Powers is Becoming Increasingly Tight</p>
<h3 id="e21">Militaristic Nation Actively Prepares for War with Unprecedented Naval Budget <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy Ministry's budget for next year is 760 million yuan, an unprecedentedly large budget. The naval authorities understand that the empire's finances are currently difficult, but in view of the increasing trend of economic blockade against Japan by the powers and the imminent expiration of the Washington Treaty in 1936, the strengthening of the navy is absolutely necessary for national defense in Japan during this extraordinary period, and they are determined to strive for the full amount. The largest item in this budget is 230 million yuan, included in the first year of the Second Replenishment Plan of 670 million yuan. The next largest item is 105 million yuan for the refitting of warships, which is closely related to maintaining existing strength. The contents of the budget are as follows (in thousands of yuan): Basic budget 25,000, new requests 510,000. The main breakdown is as follows: First year of the Second Replenishment Plan 230,000, warship refitting costs 105,000, advance payment for aircraft factory equipment 5,000, equipment costs for various naval ports and schools 1,000, warship maintenance costs 20,000, reorganization of air units 80,000, aircraft carrier and aircraft construction costs 8,400, aircraft carrier aircraft construction costs 4,800, air unit expansion costs 6,200, submarine secondary battery installation costs 2,000, additional oil purchase costs 30,000, others omitted.

<p>General Ma Zhanshan has already listed the number of comfort donations he has received and officially announced it. The various rumors that have been circulating for months regarding this donation have now been verified by a fact. The donations collected from the people of the whole country, who tightened their belts and even destroyed their homes to relieve the national crisis, were rumored to be as much as 20 million yuan. However, General Ma actually received only over 1.7 million yuan, less than one-tenth. More than nine-tenths are unknown where they have gone. This is not only a matter of the whereabouts of the funds, but also a manifestation of the extent of moral degradation today.</p>
<p>The Chinese people, taught by historical facts, are quite cautious about donating money for public causes. It is not difficult for those who are eager to help the public to sacrifice their family property. However, it is impossible to know how much actual benefit will accrue to those they wish to help. Since such questions arise from facts, they cannot but make enthusiastic people wary. During the three-year-long severe drought in the Northwest and the great flood that affected sixteen provinces twenty years ago, charitable donations were only collected after Zhu Qinglan came forward to handle the relief efforts. This was not without reason. After the September 18th Incident, the whole country was indignant. When they heard that General Ma Zhanshan had raised an army in Longjiang to resist Japan, both women and children were moved. Comfort donations were collected without solicitation. At that time, most of the organizations or individuals collecting the donations were trusted by the people of the country. Those who handled the collection and remittance of donations were also quite careful to show their credibility. Unexpectedly, under such circumstances, more than nine-tenths of the donations are still missing. What kind of stimulus does this give to patriotic people who enthusiastically donate money?</p>
<p>The urgent task today is for all organizations that handle the collection and remittance of donations to quickly initiate a self-examination. General Ma Zhanshan's notice asks each donor to investigate on their own. However, in fact, very few individual donors remit comfort money directly themselves. Since suspicions have arisen regarding the trust entrusted to the receiving organizations by the donors, both for the sake of the whereabouts of the donations and for their own credibility, they cannot avoid the trouble of examination and must quickly initiate a thorough investigation. This matter should be initiated by organizations that have handled a large number of donations, establishing a joint office to first determine how much each organization has handled and how much has been properly accounted for. For the unaccounted-for funds, they should check with banks and post offices to find out where the money went. Fortunately, these comfort donations were not only remitted by banks and post offices according to certain procedures, but also the receiving organizations were mostly aware of the need to be cautious and had thorough procedures in place. In the future, when the truth comes out, the responsibility will not be difficult to ascertain. The general examination is not very difficult, but it depends on the self-respect and determination of the receiving organizations.</p>
<p>Back in the time of the Taiping Rebellion, Peng Lisheng wrote to Zeng Guofan, discussing the reasons why the situation at that time was incurable, citing that the people had lost all sense of shame. What is the state of the people's hearts today in the midst of national crisis? We will see it from the results of the general examination of the Ma Zhanshan comfort donations.</p>

<p>Its Purpose is Military</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, the feelings of major European and American countries towards Japan have deteriorated daily. They have increased tariffs on Japanese goods and implemented a de facto boycott. The Japanese government has changed to a small-country policy, paying attention to Siam, Afghanistan, and the Netherlands. Siam and Afghanistan have never had much trade with Japan, which does not help in trade. Japan's attention to these two countries is for military purposes. If war breaks out, and Britain and the United States unite against Japan, Japan will use Afghanistan as a place for anti-British conspiracies, manipulating the Indian independence movement from there. Using Siam's geographical advantages, it can contain Britain and France and serve as a fuel supply base for Japanese submarine fleets. This policy of Japan will cause even more serious resistance from Britain and France. (1st China United Press Telegram)</p>

For example, the Industrial Daily warned the people that the success of the Soviet Union's efforts to consolidate world peace cannot guarantee that the Soviet Union will not be attacked from abroad. The situation on the Far Eastern border remains very tense because the Japanese army is still approaching the Russian border, creating a situation of advancing towards China. The Soviet government has repeatedly attempted to conclude a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty to eliminate the current tension, but has been repeatedly rejected by the Japanese government for various excuses. Also, the Red Banner newspaper of the Army Committee stated that the growth of our power is the source of our peaceful policy, and the reason why we have been able to maintain peace in Liaodong to this day is precisely this.

<h3 id="e29">Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, et al. Return to Nanjing from Lushan, Central Political Council Convenes Meeting <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 6:30 this morning, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and more than a dozen others arrived in Nanjing aboard the Ninghai warship. At 8:00, the Central Political Council convened a high-level meeting. The attendees included Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Chen Gongbo, Luo Wengan, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Shi Ying, Zhou Yawei, Chen Shuren, Shi Qingyang, and over thirty others. Wang reported on everything that transpired at the Lushan conference and discussed the various important cases decided upon at the Lushan conference. The meeting adjourned around 9:00. According to Wang, after arriving in Lushan, he first discussed urgent military and political issues with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The discussion focused on military matters. After seven days, President Sun Ke was also invited to Lushan and continued the discussions. There were more than ten meetings in thirteen days. Regarding the telegrams of Wang, Chiang, and Feng proposing frugality, no reply has been received yet. He believes that the four measures proposed in the frugality telegram will be accepted. If they still cannot be reconciled, they will need to find a second step. The work of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi Province is now taking a steady and progressive approach, while also providing special training for the bandit suppression troops and paying more attention to the post-war recovery of the bandit areas. Chairman Huang of the Political Council is currently busy receiving the war zones and will come to Gan with Yu Xiaohou in about a week and will then transfer to Beijing. Also, Sun said that the Lushan conference has already listed the policy direction of the current situation in the Wang, Chiang, and Feng telegrams. If Feng values ​​the country, he will never cause internal strife and bring hardship to the people. As for the rumor that the Chahar matter will be resolved at the Fifth Plenary Congress, he has not heard of it. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang, accompanied by Sun Ke, Gu Mengyu, Zeng Zhongming, Zhu Jiahua, and Chen Shaokuan, returned to Nanjing by Ninghai warship at 6:20 a.m. on the 1st. Chu Minyi, Peng Xuepei, Liang Hancao, and Li Shijia went to welcome them. The ship docked in the heart of the Yangtze River at Xiaguan. President Wang and the welcoming staff took the Pingming ferry to the pier. The Ninghai warship played music and fired salutes. Wang smiled and returned the salute, and after landing, he took a car back to his official residence. Wang said that the Kuling meeting concluded successfully. Most of the issues of the current situation have been detailed in the thrift telegrams. Feng has not yet responded to the thrift telegrams. The Central Government always seeks a peaceful solution to the Chahar matter, and hopes that Feng can be persuaded to give way. If Feng is still not awake, a plan will be decided. Reports that he sent Xie Zhiru to Zhangjiakou are not accurate. He has already sent a telegram to Ping, Huang, and He to investigate. Huang Fu is expected to go to Lushan from Ping in about a week to discuss North China political affairs with Chairman Chiang. The cotton and wheat loan will be used for construction and rural revitalization. As for how to allocate it, it cannot be fully determined until Finance Minister Song returns home. His technical cooperation with the League of Nations does not involve politics at all. Japan's unreasonable opposition should be ignored. The new matter is related to the development of the Northwest and should be discussed in detail. However, the matters that urgently need to be decided can be proposed for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 1st. No party affairs were discussed in Kuling, but the Fifth Plenary Congress will be held as scheduled. He did not disclose the military aspects, but the process of the Kuling conference will be reported in detail at the Central Political Council meeting on the morning of the 2nd. Sun Ke said that he was invited to Lushan by Wang and Chiang to discuss how to deal with the current situation. All issues have been largely resolved. They are determined to seek a peaceful resolution to the Chahar matter. Feng should be persuaded to give way. His technical cooperation with the League of Nations is purely for material construction in our country. Japan's妄想 to oppose it can be allowed to oppose it. The Southwest committees have already reached an understanding with the Central Government, and the Fifth Plenary Congress will not be rescheduled. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Gan on the 1st. Because his mother is still in Qingdao, he went to Shanghai on the evening of the 1st, and will go to Qingdao again in a few days, staying for ten days and escorting his mother back to Shanghai and then to Nanjing.

<p>(Nanjing) After arriving in Beijing, President Wang immediately invited the Central Standing Committee and dignitaries in Beijing to discuss matters at the Central Political Council. In the afternoon, he attended the Executive Yuan meeting, and reported on his trip to Kuling at the Central Political Council meeting on the morning of the 2nd. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The thrift (28th) telegram issued by President Wang and Chairman Chiang the other day is very detailed regarding the central government's domestic and foreign policy, especially the sincere and clear expression of its position on the Chahar matter. It is reported that after receiving this telegram, Feng Yuxiang issued the Shi (31st telegram) yesterday, still failing to accept the four measures proposed by the central government on the Chahar matter, and shamelessly exaggerating his achievements in recovering Baochang and Doron, covering up his faults and denying his mistakes, without any sincerity for peace. The government and the people of the whole country hope for a peaceful solution to the Chahar matter, which is not worth Feng Yuxiang's concern. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Sun Tonggang telegraphed from Beijing this afternoon, saying that he could arrive at Yan at 4:00 p.m., planning to fly around several times and then fly to Jinan, arriving at 5:00 p.m. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life held flags and formed teams, with hundreds of people going to the airport to welcome him. Party, government, and military dignitaries all arrived. The whole city flew flags. Sun's parents, elder brother, sisters-in-law, and the German Consul Sigun all arrived. Waiting until 6:30 p.m., they received a telegram from Xuzhou saying that Sun arrived in Xuzhou at 4:00 p.m. due to heavy rain and landed. It was decided to fly to Jinan early on the 2nd, and the people dispersed. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Aviator Sun Tonggang flew from Beijing to Gan a few days ago and then went to Lushan to meet Chiang. Now that he has finished his business, he flew from Gan to Beijing on the morning of the 1st and then flew back to Jinan at noon. (1st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Young aviator Sun Tonggang flew to Gan on July 28 to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang. He returned to Beijing on the morning of the 1st. Because he was eager to visit his family, he flew to Jinan at 1:00 p.m. in advance. Those who saw him off included Fang Zhi, Secretary of the Central Propaganda Committee, Zhang Yuanliang, City Party Secretary, Lai Lian, Secretary-General of the City Government, and representatives of various people's organizations, reporters, etc., about 200 people. Sun shook hands with those who were seeing him off and took off, estimating that he would arrive in Jinan at 5:00 p.m. According to Sun, he reported on the German aviation industry in detail in Gan. Chiang expressed his deep admiration for the German people's perseverance in developing aviation and urged him to go to Germany again to study aircraft manufacturing, and he should work even harder to live up to the expectations of the Chinese people. In Jiujiang, he received the courtesy of Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Administration. He originally planned to return to Beijing on the 31st, but Xu retained him for a day and invited aviation colleagues to host a banquet. Therefore, he flew to Beijing today. He is now planning to go to Ji'nan to visit his family first, and then decide on his next steps after a week. The rumor that he is going to marry a certain lady is absolutely untrue because marriage is a major obstacle for aviation personnel. It was also learned that the aircraft that Sun prepared originally had a proposal to donate to the National Government. Now, because it is still needed for use, it will be decided after returning to Jinan. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng telegraphed earlier to invite Sun to Shanghai. Now, he has learned that Sun replied to Wu, saying that because his father had urged him to return home by letter and telegram, he would go to Ji'nan on the 1st and fly to Shanghai to see him at a later date.

<p>Russia Sends Experts to the United States to Inspect Industry</p>
<p>The United States is Willing to Lend Russia Money at Favorable Terms to Purchase Goods</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the announcement today that 41 Soviet technical experts will arrive in the United States shortly to inspect industrial equipment, it has been heard that the US government will decide on its policy toward Russia in the very short term. It is expected that the United States will now only conclude a trade agreement with Russia, or will it restore full diplomatic relations, and it will be announced soon. Among the Soviet technical experts, it is said that there are two famous cotton experts, and it is expected that they will continue to purchase US cotton after arriving in the United States. As for the cotton that the Soviet Union ordered from the United States a few days ago, worth a total of 4.5 million yuan, it will be shipped this week. It has also been heard that the technical experts who came to the United States this time have the right to order machinery from the United States. However, the US government's order allowing Russian experts to enter the country is not attached to an understanding of purchasing US goods. Therefore, international competition for trade with the Soviet Union will be fierce, and since the UK and Russia have stopped boycotting each other's goods, British manufacturers will be a formidable competitor to the Americans. However, the US Finance Rehabilitation Company is quite in favor of lending money at favorable terms. The Soviet Union currently needs machinery worth about 75 million US dollars. The company has already loaned Russia money to purchase cotton and is willing to lend money for this industrial equipment as well. It has also been heard that the US government is currently eager to dispose of agricultural stocks, and the Soviet Union can borrow money to purchase large quantities of cotton at extremely favorable terms.

<p>(Nanjing) Recently, cases of (relapsing fever) have been discovered in this city, with a higher concentration in Xiaguan and the southern part of the city, but it has spread throughout the whole city. Those affected are all poor people and have now been admitted to the infectious disease hospital. Director Ni reported that the patients showed red spots on their arms and wrists, which were not caused by fleas. If caused by fleas, there would be bites all over the body, and it would not be limited to the wrists. Mosquitoes would bite the wrists because the body is covered by clothes. It is suspected that they are caused by mosquito bites, but a review of various medical books does not indicate transmission by mosquitoes or insects. Most of those affected by (relapsing fever) in this city live in lower houses. The infectious disease hospital is now working with the Health Department to research and discover a new source of the epidemic. If it is indeed transmitted by mosquitoes, it will be a major contribution to the medical field worldwide. The current research method involves, after discovering a patient with this disease, detailed inquiries by the infectious disease hospital about the patient's residence, followed by a joint visit by the Health Department to the patient's bed to capture mosquitoes and bring them back to extract blood for examination. If the bacteria is found in the blood taken from the mosquito, it can be proved. In addition, the affected patients are injected with 606, but if the body temperature is too high and does not drop, the heart weakens, so the danger of death should not be ignored.

It is said that the Ministry's Mining Department is currently drafting a large-scale extraction plan, preparing for the government to raise funds for extraction.

<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangdong Seamen's Union is now preparing to extend its struggle against the Taikoo Steamship Company, seeking housing for the strikers and, if possible, finding them alternative employment so that they can no longer work in their old professions. Due to the boycott of Taikoo's ships, goods bound for Shanghai and various ports along the Yangtze River are now mostly transported by ships from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Taikoo Company is currently refusing to resolve the dispute in Guangzhou, so this matter may be difficult to resolve for some time. It is reported that the Xiamen seamen have also decided to boycott Taikoo's ships and will implement this soon. (1st Day Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e68">Interview with Trotsky, Leader of the Anti-Cadre Faction in Russia <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Attitude of Convalescing in La Ciotat Quite Negative</p>
<p>Meeting with Litvinov Unconfirmed</p>
<p>Havas Telegram, Paris, 31st - "Paris Soir" today published a report from its interviewer who went to La Ciotat to interview Trotsky, the leader of the Soviet Russian Communist opposition. Mr. Trotsky is now recuperating in La Ciotat, and Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and Soviet Russian Ambassador to Turkey Suritz have also come to the area for recuperation. The newspaper said that Litvinov and Suritz are both old friends of Trotsky, who fought together in the revolution. Since being exiled to Prinkipo Island in Turkey, Trotsky has suffered greatly from the change in environment and has lost much of his spirit. Therefore, his only hope is to return to Soviet Russia and spend his last years in his homeland. Trotsky is often monitored by the Soviet Russian Embassy in his exile. Now Ambassador Suritz has also come to La Ciotat for medical treatment due to health reasons. Was this a chance encounter, or is it because Trotsky's spirit is not strong, and he is suffering from misfortune, depression, and illness, that he has also come for medical treatment? However, since Ambassador Suritz has come to La Ciotat, he should meet with Foreign Minister Litvinov. Will Suritz be able to ask the Foreign Minister for a meeting on behalf of Trotsky? Last Monday, Trotsky arrived at Chara Village, a scenic village near La Ciotat. Ambassador Suritz also arrived on the same day, but not in the same car as Trotsky. Trotsky came here hoping to meet with Foreign Minister Litvinov to explain the situation. France's permission for Trotsky to come to France for medical treatment has already given him considerable psychological comfort, so Trotsky wants to take this opportunity to seek a meeting with Foreign Minister Litvinov, as Litvinov has considerable influence over Soviet Russian Communist leader Stalin. The newspaper said that Trotsky did not arrange to meet with Litvinov in Chara Village, but came here because he was eager to meet. Unexpectedly, Litvinov refused to meet, saying, "I have no reason to meet with Mr. Trotsky." This shows that it is not yet time for Trotsky to be pardoned. After Litvinov refused to meet with Trotsky, Ambassador Suritz went to La Ciotat for medical treatment, consulting doctors every day. He is currently unable to leave his home. Litvinov is also undergoing hot spring treatment in La Ciotat. Trotsky is recuperating in a friend's villa in Auvergne. He suffers from heart disease, has difficulty walking, and is pale and thin. He is now waiting for the rumors about his coming to France to subside, so that he can recuperate in peace.</p>

<h3 id="e70">France Emphasizes Foreign Propaganda <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>National, Paris, 31st - According to news published in the inaugural issue of the Vilita newspaper today, the French government has recently established a plan to expand and intensify foreign propaganda. This plan includes all countries of the world, with particular emphasis on Britain and the United States. With regard to Britain, the focus is on speeding up air mail in order to ensure that French official newspapers can be published simultaneously with local British newspapers. In addition, it is planned to establish a French opinion dissemination agency to provide French opinions to British newspapers, so that the British public can always understand the French perspective. Furthermore, radio will also be used in the future, with the French Embassy as the center, to establish close relations with British public opinion circles. As for the United States, the most urgent task for the government is how to use propaganda to gradually shift American public opinion towards France. The most appropriate methods of propaganda are to use radio to disseminate news, distribute pamphlets, establish direct relations with important American figures, improve the intelligence group of the Embassy in the United States, and appoint a propaganda expert to take charge of the matter. As for the country, it is reported that the French Foreign Ministry will hire an American news expert to conduct detailed reviews of American newspapers, or to draft answers to any criticisms of France in American public opinion. It is said that France will emphasize propaganda towards the United States even more in the future, because the French Foreign Ministry has conducted a detailed investigation of the reasons and methods for the success of anti-French propaganda in the United States, and deeply feels that it is imperative to urgently provide accurate French news to the United States. Therefore, the French Foreign Ministry is also planning to establish a French news agency in New York and hire an American expert to take charge of it. In addition, it is planned to publish an English-language magazine in the United States to introduce French news to the American public. France and the United States are also planning to exchange rescue students to promote friendship between the two countries. These are all propaganda plans recently drafted by the French government, and it is reported that Mr. Commaille, the former Director of the Information Group of the League of Nations Secretariat, will be responsible for all propaganda matters of the French government in the future.</p>

<p>Prosecutor's Argument Requests Seven Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>(Telecommunications, Tokyo, 1st) The first public trial of Dr. Hajime Kawakami was announced to open by Judge Fujii at the Tokyo District Court at 9:40 a.m. today. Most of those in the audience were students of the doctor, and he was escorted to court by police officers in a timely manner. The doctor's appearance had become thin. In response to the judge's questions, he confessed to his belief in communism, admitted to transcribing the Third International's program for Japan, donating a total of 15,000 yen to the Party, and joining the Communist Party. All the facts of the crime were asked by the judge. Whether he would no longer consider communism in the future, he replied: "My views are all as written in my prison monologue." Asked: "Isn't it contradictory for the defendant to believe in Marxism but not practice it?" He replied: "Life is full of contradictions. Knowing that tobacco and alcohol are harmful to the human body, people still indulge in them. It cannot be explained by theory." Later, the prosecutor's argument requested a sentence of seven years. Midday break (Japan Federation, Tokyo, 1st) Because Dr. Kawakami is a famous scholar, the courtroom was full of spectators. The authorities also took extreme precautions because the day was also the multi-Emperor Wen Battle Movement Festival. The judge asked Kawakami if his work "Prison Monologue" was now confused, and Kawakami replied "yes." The judge also asked, "Is the defendant's retirement to the study as a defeated soldier of Marxism-Leninism, and his cessation of actual movement, contradictory to each other?" Kawakami replied, "Everything in the present world is contradictory." Next, Prosecutor Tozawa delivered his argument, saying that the defendant was already fifty-five years old, and had not been in the Communist Party for very long. In private, he could not help but express sympathy, but according to the regulations, he requested seven years of imprisonment. The court adjourned temporarily and will reopen at 1 p.m. The lawyer defended Kawakami and requested a suspended sentence.</p>

<p>Reuters, Albany, USA, 31st - In the case of the kidnapping of the nephew of New York State Democratic leader Walker Connell, two people have been arrested and are awaiting trial. The names of the two people cannot be announced by officials. John Walker Connell was redeemed yesterday, having been kidnapped for three weeks. His physical condition is still good, but his mental state has been over-stimulated. It is said that he was treated quite well when he was kidnapped. It is also reported that David Gamer of Brooklyn is missing. Although Mr. Tai was once wealthy, he is now poor. It is thought that the kidnappers were unaware of this, resulting in a mistaken kidnapping. According to today's investigation, since the trend of kidnapping has become prevalent, six states in the United States have increased the penalties for kidnapping, changing them to the death penalty.</p>

<p>Hopes for Peaceful Resolution of the Situation</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: The handover of the war zone is being carried out smoothly by the war zone reception committee members Yin Tong, Lei Shou-rong, Tao Shang-ming, etc. The eight counties of Ninghe, Yutian, Fengrun, Luanxian, Leting, Funing, Changli, Lulong, and Linyu in eastern Tianjin have already been successively received. Although there were minor setbacks in the process, they were ultimately resolved through our reasoned negotiations. The two counties of Miyun and Huairou in northern Hebei were also received simultaneously by the two county magistrates, Sun Shutang and Xu Wenquan, who led accompanying police personnel yesterday (the 29th). The Japanese army will also withdraw from outside the Great Wall within a week, according to the resolutions of the Dalian talks. The issue of opening the Beining Railway to traffic will be implemented as soon as the Japanese army has completed its withdrawal, with a target date of around August 5th. Everything should be settled by then.</p>
<p>Yin Tong and Lei Shou-rong took trains from Yuguan and Tangshan respectively last night and arrived in Beiping after midnight. They immediately visited He Yingqin and Huang Fu to report on the handover process. According to what Mr. Lei told reporters this morning (the 30th), the handover of the counties in the war zone is nearing completion. The main points are as follows: ㈠</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the puppet troops in the war zone, an agreement has been generally reached after several days of consultations with Li Jichun. The surplus troops of Li's army have been successively loaded onto trains and transported to Machang, where they will be disbanded separately. Based on the results of the recent handling, the reorganization of the puppet troops is currently only at the stage of creating lists. The subsequent reorganization and training matters are only just beginning. Due to the uniforms for the newly reorganized puppet troops being manufactured in Tianjin, the reorganization and training cannot be implemented until the 4,000 sets of uniforms are manufactured in Tianjin and transported to Tangshan. ㈡ Li Jichun's title has been decided as the chairman of the war zone army reorganization committee, and he will be publicly elected by the members of the reorganization committee, not appointed by any organization. He will be dismissed immediately after the reorganization period expires. ㈢ In the war zone, only Zunhua and Qian'an counties in the east road have not yet been received, and only Jixian county in the north road also needs to wait slightly because puppet troops and bandits are still entrenched in these areas and progress can only be made after the banditry is suppressed. As for the notification slip issued by the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tangshan, Matsunoo, to the county magistrates on the 27th when our handover train arrived in Tangshan, requesting the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs to report all matters to the Japanese military headquarters after taking office, this is only a one-sided demand from the Japanese side and should not be regarded as a command. In fact, it has no effect. The issue of opening the Beining Railway to traffic still needs to be delayed slightly until the Japanese army has completely withdrawn, otherwise, it may cause complications and lead to delays. According to Yin Tong, when receiving Linyu County this time, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Yuguan, Ochiai, had not received the negotiation order and did not allow our personnel to disembark when the reception train arrived, so it was immediately returned to Qinhuangdao and the county government was re-established in Haiyang Town. This matter is because the situation in Yuguan is complex, with the presence of the Japanese army, the "Manchukuo Border Police," and many puppet troops of different factions, each forming its own system, so Linyu County city is not easy to receive temporarily.</p>
<p>The situation in Chahar was tense for a time, but recently, with the government's solemn statement advocating peace regarding the political situation in Chahar Province, all parties believe there is hope for a turnaround. Deng Zhexi came to Beiping from Tianjin a few days ago and visited Xiong Bin, Song Zheyuan, etc. to discuss solutions. Deng telegraphed Feng Yuxiang, asking him to cancel the title of commander-in-chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, but no telegram from Feng has been received to this day. This morning, He Yingqin and his wife went to the Western Hills for sightseeing. The reporter met a certain important person who said that Premier Wang (Jingwei) and Chairman Chiang (Kai-shek)'s telegrams have arrived in Beiping, stating that the central government believes that domestic communist rebellion and foreign aggression are pressing each other, and there is no way to save the crisis without national unity. They hope that Mr. Feng will be candid and maintain each other. Regarding the handling of the Chahar situation, they advocate peaceful resolution and leniency, and deeply hope for understanding of the government's difficulties. This kind of meaning is quite sincere. If Mr. Feng can accept the central government's proposed peaceful principles one by one, the Chahar issue can be resolved smoothly. At present, Mr. Feng has not yet sent a reply telegram to Beiping, and no official telegram from the central government has been received here regarding how to handle the Chahar situation. It is expected that peaceful implementation will be in one or two days. It is said that before the government sends senior officials to the north, various parties will still conduct private negotiations to resolve disputes through political means. Mr. Huang Fu is preparing to go to Jiangxi and will likely leave today or tomorrow. Yu Xuezhong believes that the handover of the war zone and the relief issues are extremely important, and originally planned to go to Kuling to meet Chairman Chiang and report on the political situation in Hebei Province, but he has now abandoned the plan. He came to Beiping yesterday to attend the war zone relief meeting and is scheduled to leave Beiping tonight to return to Tianjin. This time, the Japanese side originally took a wait-and-see attitude towards Chahar, but some people in the military insisted on taking back Dolon (Duo Lun) and Guyuan. In recent days, most of the Japanese army has concentrated in Rehe, Jingpeng and other places. It is said that the Goi Regiment of the 8th Division has already begun to attack Dolon, and the puppet troops have also had contact with the Chahar army north of Dolon, and the situation is tense, but the details are not yet clear.

<p>丨Participating in Discussions on Various Important Issues丨</p>
<p>Dispatch from Nanchang: Wang and Chiang recently telegraphed to invite Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, to come to Lushan to discuss all important issues of the current situation. After receiving the telegram, Sun arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao on the 29th. At 9:00 a.m. that morning, he transferred to a plane to Xunyang. At about 6:00 p.m. that afternoon, he arrived in Lushan and met with Chiang, Wang, Dai, Zhu Peide, Huang Shaohong, and others. It is reported that Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, and Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, have also been summoned to the south and should arrive in Lushan within a few days. Therefore, Wang and the ministers have postponed their return to Nanjing in order to have a long-term discussion on all important issues of the current situation. According to those who came from Lushan, the Lushan Conference originally planned to complete the discussion of military and political matters in three or four days, but it has now been decided to postpone the meeting.

<h3 id="e79">Major Fire in Henan, Guangzhou <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>More Than Sixty Shops Burned Down</p>
<p>Total Loss Exceeds 700,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Dispatch from Guangzhou: The residential area of Henan is separated from Guangzhou City by a narrow strip of water. Since the completion of the Pearl River Bridge, transportation has become more convenient. In recent years, roads have been opened up one after another in the interior of Henan, and most of the major factories have moved there. However, except for a few main roads, the inner streets of Henan are still very narrow, the air is also turbid, and firefighting is particularly difficult in the event of a fire. Therefore, on the evening of the 24th of this month, an unprecedented major fire broke out in the Yongxing Street area, burning down up to sixty-eight shops, with a loss of no less than 700,000 yuan, which is truly a great disaster. Yongxing Street is located west of Feng'an Bridge in Henan, with shops lining up one after another, backed by a small river. Most of the shops operate in the timber industry. On the evening in question, Hengsheng, No. 104 Yongxing Street, somehow carelessly left a fire in the wood. In an instant, the fire blazed fiercely and was impossible to approach. Before long, it turned into a prairie fire. Fire trucks from various places in Henan and Hebei rushed to put out the fire, and the fire brigade's fireboat also came to the scene to provide assistance. However, Yongxing Street has not yet been opened up into a road, and all the new-style fire trucks could not drive close to the fire scene, only connecting water pipes from a distance to spray water. There were occasional light fire trucks that could get close, but they lacked water and had no great effect. In addition, a southeast wind was blowing that night, and the flames were even more fierce. Fires broke out everywhere near the origin of the fire. Looking from afar, it was like a fire dragon, with flames soaring into the sky. From 10:00 p.m. until about 3:00 a.m. the next morning, the fire was finally extinguished. It is estimated that more than sixty fir wood shops were burned down on Yongxing Street, including Hengsheng, Guang Ping'an, Tong Mao, He Chang, Wen He, Xing Sheng, Ming Ji, Nanhua, Heng Zhan, Yi Cheng, Shun Long, Yuan Ji, Rui Rong, Chang Sheng, Guang Jixiang, Shun Ji, Xiang He, Zhong He, Long Sheng, Cai Chang, and others. Including goods and timber, the total loss was more than 690,000 yuan. Each shop was adjacent to a small canal, and all the timber was stored on the canal bank, blocking more than half of the canal, making it difficult to move. This timber was all burned to ashes.

<h3 id="e80">Hunan Provincial Government Requests Allocation of Cotton and Wheat Loan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>To Dredge Dongting Lake and Rehabilitate the Jingjiang River</p>
<p>To Promote the Cotton Industry and Maintain Cotton Mills</p>
<p>Dispatch from Changsha: The Hunan Provincial Government believes that the province has suffered from years of military disasters and floods, leading to the bankruptcy of the rural areas. The cotton and rice fields around the lake have also suffered poor harvests due to the backflow of river water and the siltation of Dongting Lake. Although the province has the First Cotton Mill, the cotton produced by the counties around the lake is still not grown and planted widely, resulting in a reduced output. The mill almost entirely purchases foreign cotton. The fundamental solution is to dredge Dongting Lake, rehabilitate the Jingjiang River, and improve the cotton industry, but none of this can be achieved without a large amount of money. In addition, the First Cotton Mill is facing difficulties due to a lack of funds, resulting in a summer shutdown. It will be difficult to resume operations without special fundraising relief. Recently, the central government's cotton and wheat loan has been successfully secured. A request has been submitted to the Executive Yuan to allocate the loan in order to proceed in various ways and benefit the people. The memorandum states: "It is our understanding that our country's production is backward, coupled with years of military disasters and floods, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The predicament is particularly severe in Hunan Province. Hunan has always been known as an agricultural province, and the ability of the people of Hunan to have sufficient food and clothing depends entirely on the abundant harvests of cotton and rice from the fields around the lake. However, since Dongting Lake has been subject to silting from four inlets, disasters have occurred repeatedly, and harvests have been poor for nine out of ten years. Taking cotton alone, due to the failure to improve seeds, the failure to promote cultivation, and the losses from floods, the quality of the output is poor and the output is reduced, making it difficult to supply the needs of the province's cotton mills. As a result, the cotton mills purchase all foreign cotton as raw materials, which increases the cost and makes it impossible to compete with foreign yarn. Business is stagnant, and there is a risk that it cannot be sustained. In order to rescue the rural areas and revitalize industry and commerce, nothing can be achieved without a large amount of money to develop water conservancy and improve and promote the cotton industry. Fortunately, the central government's cotton and wheat loan has been successfully secured. The Yuan's department must determine the principles for allocating this loan, and a large part of this loan will be used as funding for cotton production. We hereby request that the loan be allocated to develop water conservancy and the cotton industry and to maintain the cotton mills, as follows: ㈠ It is our understanding that since the Baichichi inlet of Dongting Lake has been subject to backflow of river water, the bottom of the lake has gradually silted up and the surface of the lake has become increasingly narrow. In recent years, sandbars have been densely distributed, and the dikes are adjacent to each other. Reeds are everywhere, and the original shape of Dongting Lake is no longer recognizable. The old course of the Jingjiang River (the section of the Yangtze River from Jingzhou to Chenglingji, commonly known as the Jingjiang River) has been reduced in flow by more than half due to the diversion of river water into the lake, and the flow rate has also decreased accordingly. Sand and mud have settled, not only raising the bottom of the river, but also increasing the islands in the middle of the river at the same time. The silting situation is exactly the same as that of Dongting Lake. Looking at the downstream, since the Chongming section of Hankou City, the Yangtze River basin has been surrounded by Dongting Lake for hundreds of miles due to the river water entering the lake, losing its high-level momentum and reducing its power to wash sand into the sea, resulting in the stagnation of silt and the formation of islands. Such as Hankou Beach, Sanjiangkou, Daijia Island, Zhangjia Island, Yaojia Island, Taizi Islet, Chongwen Island, Desheng Island, Liang Island, and Huguang Island, all of which lie across the heart of the river, blocking the water flow. Therefore, in recent decades, the Yangtze River basin has suffered floods every time, and the provinces along the river, from Hunan to Jiangsu, have not been spared. In 1931, the rich areas along the river were reduced to swamps, which is clear proof. Tracing the origin of the disaster, the floods are actually due to the siltation of the Yangtze River, the disrepair of Dongting Lake, and the unrehabilitated old course of the Jingjiang River. Therefore, if we want to eliminate floods, we must first dredge the Yangtze River, and dredging the river must start with dredging Dongting Lake and the Jingjiang River. According to the research results of water conservancy experts, the plan for dredging Dongting Lake and the Jingjiang River is nothing more than three points: ㈠ Dredge the Jingjiang River to straighten the bends and smooth the flow. ㈡ Excavate the Yue Li Canal to divert water into the river, and build gates downstream of the four inlets of Ouchi, Taiping, Songzi, and Tiaoxian to regulate the Jingjiang River water and prevent Dongting Lake from being silted up again. ㈢ Widen the outlet of Dongting Lake, excavate Linxiang Ma'anshan, and remove Xiyang Island in the river to allow the river water to flow smoothly and prevent it from overflowing and causing disasters. The above three points are actually the preliminary work to dredge the Yangtze River, which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, due to the exhaustion of local financial resources, it has not been possible to carry out the work. In addition, our Hunan is located in a remote area, the waterways are divergent, and the harm of Dongting Lake silting up and the situation in the Yangtze River basin are not well known by the central government. We will briefly describe the outline and pray for inspection and verification. For the sake of relief, please allocate the cotton and wheat loan to dredge Dongting Lake and the Jingjiang River to avoid floods and benefit the people. This is the first request to allocate the loan to develop water conservancy. ㈡</p>
<p>It is our understanding that our country is founded on agriculture, but the import of agricultural products has been increasing year by year. Among them, the import of cotton goods is very large, accounting for two-fifths to one-third of the value of imported goods. The shortage of raw cotton prevents the development of the spinning industry, and the import of cotton goods is increasing, which in turn leads to a decline in people's livelihood. It is urgent to find a way to rescue the situation. For the sake of improving and promoting the cotton industry in Hunan Province, the Cotton Industry Experimental Farm was established in 1930 to study and improve varieties and methods. A branch farm was established in Changde, and breeding farms were established in Huarong, Lixian, and Hengyang. Significant results have been achieved in the domestication of American cotton and the improvement of Chinese cotton. Later, the cooperation method was used to promote it in rural areas. Personnel were dispatched to guide borrowing and planting technology to alleviate economic difficulties. In less than two years, cooperation has reached 500,000 mu. The output and quality of the products are indeed higher than that of local cotton. However, at a time when the national rural economy is declining, the task of revitalization cannot be fully rescued by the efforts of one province or one city. The central government should take the lead in planning and allocating large amounts of money to carry out the promotion on a large scale, so that the effectiveness will be greater. It is our understanding that 3.28 million US dollars should be allocated from this American cotton loan as funding for cotton industry improvement and promotion, and the cotton areas in the two lakes of China that already have a foundation should be started to promote the cotton industry and stop the leakage. This is the second request to allocate the loan to develop the cotton industry. ㈢ It is our understanding that cotton is the raw material for cotton yarn. If cotton is abundant, the cost of cotton yarn is low. If cotton is scarce, the cost of cotton yarn is high. Last year, due to the poor harvest of cotton in various provinces, the price of cotton was expensive. Also, because the rural economy was sluggish, the price of cotton yarn was low. Cotton and cotton yarn went in opposite directions. Cotton mills across the country suffered heavy losses and fell into an unsustainable state. The Hunan First Cotton Mill is the only state-run cotton mill in Hunan Province, and it is also the only factory that complies with the factory law. However, due to the lack of funds, it is facing difficulties, which is especially true compared to other factories in the country. Therefore, the summer shutdown was unavoidable, waiting for the new cotton to be on the market before resuming operations. If the new cotton crop fails again and prices remain high, the factory will have to shut down for a long period of time. It is proposed to approve the monthly allocation of 5,000 dan of American cotton within the American cotton allocation, and also request that 10,000 dan of 7/8 inch middling cotton be allocated in advance when the first batch of American cotton arrives in Shanghai, so as to start operations as soon as possible. As for how the price will be determined, it will be handled in accordance with the unified regulations. This is the third request to allocate American cotton to maintain cotton mills. The above three items are all essential plans for Hunan Province. In addition to sending Yuan Hui, the director of the Hunan Cotton Industry Experimental Farm, to Beijing to present the case in person, we have prepared a memorandum and presented it to your Yuan for examination. We beseech you to consider the difficulties in Hunan and approve the request to allocate the loan and American cotton to develop water conservancy and the cotton industry and maintain the cotton mills, and await your instructions.

<p>Nantong's southwest is adjacent to the river and the collapse is very serious. In the past, the late gentleman Zhang Jian raised more than one million yuan to build eighteen stone embankments to compete with the water for land, with good results. After Zhang's death, the embankment maintenance association was taken over by the Construction Bureau, changing it from a people-run to a government-run organization. Over the years, the embankment maintenance fees collected from the field tax have been extremely large, but the money has been exhausted. The old embankments have not been repaired and have gradually collapsed. Currently, Langshan is about to enter the river, and the county people are in an uproar. Recently, the embankment maintenance association's false reporting of wages and construction costs was revealed. The chairman, Li Zhenru, has secretly left Nantong.

<h3 id="e97">Ma Zhanshan Publicly Announces Detailed Amount of Donations Received <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Totaling over 1,713,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Names of Donors Lost in the Black Province</p>
<p>The total amount of condolence donations from all sectors of the country to Ma Zhanshan reached 20 million yuan, but Ma himself claimed to have received only over 1.7 million yuan. The difference between the two figures amounts to more than 18 million yuan. Therefore, all parties requested that Ma publicly announce the donations he received and thoroughly investigate the exact amount of the donations and the procedures of the handlers to prevent embezzlement by a few. Yesterday, Ma Zhanshan provided a detailed explanation of the donations received from the start of the resistance in November of the 20th year of the Republic until his retreat back to the country, along with a list of relief items. We have specially transcribed them together as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e98">Ma's Statement on Receipts <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan yesterday issued a letter regarding the receipts and procedures. Respectfully, I, Zhanshan, fought against the Japanese and their puppets in Heilongjiang for a year. As Heilongjiang is a border province with limited resources, and during times of turmoil, financial resources were cut off, and military expenses could not be met. If it were not for the generous donations from compatriots at home and abroad, which boosted the morale of the troops and provided sustenance, it would have been impossible to sustain the fight for so long. I am deeply grateful for their enthusiasm. Now, I will describe the method of receiving donations and the circumstances before and after. The methods of remittance were divided into two categories: banks and post offices. The banks were further divided into Chinese and foreign banks. The locations where Zhanshan received donations were in Heilongjiang Province before November 24th, 20th year of the Republic, and in Hailun and Harbin from November 25th, 20th year of the Republic to February 2nd, 21st year of the Republic, divided into three locations. Except for the 85,000 yuan remitted by the Shanghai Bank of China to the Heilongjiang Branch of the Bank of China on November 13th and 14th of the 20th year of the Republic, which was immediately acknowledged by telegram, all remittances directly sent to Zhanshan by post office were returned with the name stamp affixed to the remittance receipt, and letters and telegrams of thanks were sent immediately. For remittances sent to Harbin by bank, a special commissioner was sent to Harbin to handle the receipt procedures with the bank, with a printed triplicate form prepared for filling out (but before the triplicate form was prepared, 22 receipts with Zhanshan's name stamp in ink were used). The procedure was that the bank provided a detailed list of the name of the remitter for each remittance, stating the address and amount. The commissioner filled out the triplicate form accordingly. Each form was affixed with the four-character "Ma Zhanshan Seal" on the amount of the remittance, below the recipient's name, and where the stamp was affixed. One copy was given to the bank, one copy was sent by the bank to the remitter, and one copy was kept for filing. After the commissioner completed the procedures, he recorded the amount received on a given day in a book for verification and then sent the filed copy along with the remitter's name list to Hailun. The personnel in charge of receiving condolence donations at the慰劳招待处established in Hailun made detailed registrations and were responsible for safekeeping and filing. Zhanshan then sent letters and telegrams of thanks separately. According to statistics, the amount received in Heilongjiang up to February 22nd, 21st year of the Republic, converted into various currencies, was approximately 1,380,710 yuan, 0 jiao, and 3 fen. On April 2nd, 21st year of the Republic, Zhanshan swiftly left the province for Heihe, and all documents could not be carried. Therefore, the detailed records and files were left in the provincial capital. Fortunately, a book kept by the personnel sent to Harbin was still kept by the personnel. However, this book was originally only used to verify the amount received on a given day and did not clearly record who remitted from where. This is the reason why the names of remitters or organizations cannot be listed in detail in this disclosure of the received funds. I, Zhanshan, think that since Zhanshan departed from Heihe, his whereabouts have been uncertain. There was no designated bank or fixed location for receiving remittances from various places. If any donors have not received the above-mentioned triplicate form, the receipt with Zhanshan's name stamp, and the letter or telegram of thanks, I am afraid there may be errors. However, banks and post offices all have prescribed procedures, and it should not be difficult to clarify the truth through investigation. As for the funds handled by the Heihe Provincial Government, Ma Kui, Duan Zhongfan, Deng Wenshao, Binshan, and Li Zhongyi in Pinghu, and the funds received by Zhanshan in Shanghai after returning to the country, the names and locations of the remitters will be disclosed in detail. In short, for the funds received, please ask the remitting institutions to investigate the original circumstances. Zhanshan, relying on your high regard, should also express his gratitude. All the funds disposed of are listed in the list for your perusal. In addition, the funds received by the Liaojihei Support Association have considerable procedures. The condolence items from all sectors in Harbin and other places were either carried to the front line with the funds for distribution to the troops or directly distributed by the donors. Because the files are in the province and have not been brought out, the names and quantities of all donors, organizations, and items have not been listed one by one. I hereby declare this.</p>

<p>The Foreign Concession Authorities Were Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>Yesterday was the "August 1st" World Anti-Imperialist Anti-War Movement Day. The Chinese Concession police agencies in this city, in order to strictly prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to create disturbances, imposed a temporary curfew. The police stations in each district of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were ordered to double the guards on all main roads, strictly prevent gatherings, parades, and demonstrations. Chief Inspector Gong Xikui specially dispatched inspectors to patrol and inspect suspicious pedestrians at the borders of the Chinese Concession. The leader of the detective team, Lu Ying, ordered all detectives to be led by foremen to guard everywhere, especially at the intersections of Fangxie Road Public Stadium and the North and South Railway Stations. The Security Department stationed troops to guard the Municipal Government and other places on Xietu Road, and the Navy Guard Battalion guarded Gaochang Temple. The Garrison Headquarters patrol team patrolled as usual. All the police stations in the Public Concession were ordered to step up their guard. In addition to dispatching secret agents separately, the most stringent measures were taken in the west and east of Shanghai. The police stations in the French Concession, with factories and schools densely populated in the western district, were under particularly strict guard. In the evening, all places were peaceful, and the stationed detectives and police began to withdraw. Only reactionary slogans were found on the walls, and many reactionary propaganda materials were seized.</p>

<p>Negotiating the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>French Ambassador Weili De took the 11:30 night train to Beijing last night to meet with Foreign Minister Luo Wengang to discuss the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty. This treaty had already become one of the important diplomatic negotiations during Wang Zhengting's tenure as foreign minister. Later, due to different opinions from the French side on the draft treaty annex, the negotiations reached a stalemate. Now, with the increasing trade between China and Vietnam, there is an increasing need to regulate commerce through a substantial treaty. The French ambassador's trip to Beijing for negotiations is widely hoped to fulfill his mission.</p>

<p>Sun Zhesheng was originally in Qingdao to escape the summer heat. Because central political affairs urgently needed consultation, he took the Puan back to Shanghai and went to Lushan to meet with Chairman Chiang to discuss everything. Yesterday, he sent staff to the China Merchants Bureau to book several first-class rooms on the Puan, which leaves for Qingdao on the 8th of this month. President Sun will board the ship at Jinliyuan Pier at 9:00 this morning. Sun's trip to Qingdao this time is to welcome his mother back to Shanghai, so after arriving in Qingdao, he will have to return to Shanghai by ship.</p>

It has now been decided to travel with President Sun on the 8th of this month. Therefore, yesterday, he also booked a first-class room on the Puan from the China Merchants Bureau. It is heard that there are still many people from the central government who will also be traveling on this ship at that time.</p>
<p>Letter from Liang Long, Minister to Germany</p>
<h3 id="e105">Raising Funds for Medicinal Materials <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Medicinal Materials Directly Transported to the Red Cross Society in Pingjin, Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>Donations Remitted by the Guangdong Bank to the Refugee Association</p>
<p>The United Federation of Charitable Organizations in this city for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a letter yesterday from Liang Long, our country's minister to Germany, reporting on the raising of medicinal materials in Germany for transport to China to relieve wounded soldiers and war zone refugees. In addition, donations will be remitted. The original letter is transcribed as follows: Respected Gentlemen of the United Federation for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees, I received two donation registers from your association forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I immediately convened a meeting of overseas Chinese in Germany to discuss how to carry out fundraising. It was unanimously decided on the spot that the overseas Chinese organizations here, namely the United Federation of Overseas Chinese Industry and Commerce in Germany and the General Federation of Chinese Students in Germany, would send people to solicit donations, and the General Federation of Students would solicit medicinal materials from German chemical factories and major pharmacies for wound care and epidemic prevention. Fortunately, we received enthusiastic support from all parties. Major factories and pharmacies unanimously donated medicinal materials, which were directly transported to the Red Cross Society in Pingjin, Ning, and Shanghai for transfer. However, due to the impact of the world economic depression, increased unemployment, and poverty, it has been difficult to proceed with the donation section. The overseas Chinese friends are either studying abroad, and their funds are often insufficient, or they are engaging in petty trade, and their meager profits are often not obtained. In addition, our country has no major merchants or wealthy businessmen operating here. Fortunately, with the efforts of the fundraisers, the results were not entirely satisfactory, but we still obtained 201 marks, which, according to today's exchange rate of the French Bank in this country, is equivalent to 211 yuan, 5 jiao, and 7 fen in Chinese currency. This is remitted by the Guangdong Bank of Shanghai, together with the original donation registers. Please check and receive it, and please issue receipts to the donors for verification. I wish you all the best, Liang Long, Minister of the Republic of China to Germany, June 22nd.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Young Goes to Japan to Escape the Summer Heat <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Are Paying Close Attention</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, Dr. Yang Ge, the Far East representative of the Institute of Pacific Relations who accompanied the Lytton Commission to inspect Manchuria, Japan, recently arrived in Japan on the 30th of last month after touring various parts of North China. According to his statement to Japanese reporters, the purpose of his trip to Japan is purely to escape the summer heat and visit diplomatic authorities, but he refused to make any political statements, saying that he was afraid of causing misunderstandings. However, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met with a diplomatic official from a certain country yesterday morning. When talking about Yang Ge's actions, he also said that he did not know the truth, whether he had any mission. However, the general observation of the outside world is that since Mr. Yang is the Far East representative of the Institute of Pacific Relations and a specialist on the Manchurian issue, at a time when China is actively cooperating technically with the League of Nations and is opposed by Japan, his departure cannot be regarded as having no mission. From the perspective of his personal duties, he is already a very prominent figure in international politics. The Japanese have accused Yang of being an anti-Japanese expert. At this time, in order to protect its economic interests in China, Japan is actively undermining technical cooperation between the international community and China, as well as huge loans to China from various countries, in an international environment, abandoning Japan in isolation. Japan is trying its best to undermine and threaten, but at the same time, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs suddenly advocates diplomacy with China, temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, making it difficult for the international community to see the security of Japan's true intentions, and the recent anti-Japanese winds in British colonies such as India and East Africa have seriously hit Japanese industry and commerce in a great depression. What is the domestic situation in Japan now? It is also what the international community wants to understand very clearly, so Dr. Yang Ge's trip cannot be said to be absolutely unrelated to the above-mentioned issues. However, observers also said that the Japanese have no good feelings for Yang Ge, and Yang will inevitably be treated coldly in Japan. The severe inspection of Yang's luggage at the Kobe Customs can be inferred that if Yang's words and deeds in Japan are slightly careless, he may be forced to leave the country.</p>
<p>Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e107">Yuan Lianghua Assumes Office Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Will First Assume Office, and Select Another Day for a Supplementary Oath</p>
<p>Releases Statement on Improving Fisheries Construction</p>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industries, Yuan Lianghua, assumed office yesterday. The former Director, Chen Zhongsheng, also went to the office to handle the handover. Mr. Yuan held an assumption of office ceremony, delivered a speech, and released his policy for handling administrative affairs, which are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Welcomed Upon Arrival <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>At eight o'clock in the morning, all the staff and guards of the bureau went to the New Asia Hotel to welcome the new director. In advance, a red archway was erected high at the main gate, a military band was hired, and a large number of firecrackers were purchased. When the director entered the gate, the firecrackers were set off, and the military band played loudly to express their welcome. Among the guests who arrived were Hou Chaohai of the Fisheries Improvement Association, Luo Yonghu of the Construction Fee Collection Office, and others, who stepped forward to shake hands and offer congratulations. The former Director Chen Zhongsheng also arrived. The two parties then handled the handover and held the inauguration ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Inauguration Ceremony <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Held at nine o'clock, without an oath (because the Ministry of Industries did not send a supervisor, which will be arranged for a later date), presided over by Chen Zhongsheng, with all the proper decorum. He first gave a speech to introduce the new Director. Mr. Yuan then delivered a speech, saying, "Brothers, my greatest hope in coming here today is to contribute to the national construction in the construction of the revolutionary government. Although I consider my personal ability to be limited, I am determined to carry out the work with a revolutionary spirit, no matter how difficult it may be, and strive to make the fishing industry progress day by day, so as to be worthy of the country and the people. To achieve this goal, we must work hard in two aspects: passively relieving the suffering of fishermen and actively improving and constructing the fishing industry. I hope that all colleagues will take on the responsibility of integrity, hard work, and sacrifice everything to do it, and work together." After the speech, a photograph was taken to complete the ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Releases Statement <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Afterward, a reporter from the Guomin News Agency spoke with Mr. Yuan, asking about the collection of construction fees and future plans. He said, "Regarding the collection of fishery construction fees, I have only seen it in the newspaper. Now that I have just taken office, I have not yet studied the content, so I am sorry I cannot express an opinion. As for future plans, the Ministry of Industries has already drafted them, and is paying unusual attention to the fishing industry. This bureau should follow them. The most urgent things to do recently are to establish a fishermen's bank and add fishing protection cruisers. These two items should be realized soon."</p>
<h3 id="e111">Mr. Yuan's Biography <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yuan graduated from the Guangdong Naval Industrial School and the Whampoa Naval Academy. He successively served as the commander of the Guangdong Army Advance Team, captain of the Yongfeng warship, director of the Modaokou Liquor Factory, director of the Auditing Department of the Naval Bureau, concurrently serving as a staff officer, and chief of staff of the First Fleet Command of the Guangdong Navy. He is currently a specialist of the Ministry of Industries and also holds this current position.</p>
<p>After the Signing of the North China Truce Agreement</p>
<h3 id="e112">Dumping of Japanese Goods in China <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Last Month Suddenly Exceeded 50 Million Yuan. The World Sales Market for Japanese Goods, After Encountering Serious Setbacks, Actively Sought to Make China Its Outlet for Dumping. According to Industry Sources, Since the Signing of the North China Truce Agreement, the Japanese Have Been Actively Recovering and Developing Sales Markets in South and North China, with Significant Progress. The General Situation Is Recorded Below.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Alarming Numbers <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Before the signing of the North China Truce Agreement, the total value of Japanese goods imported each month was about 20 to 30 million yuan. After the end of the military conflict, Japanese merchants, under the urgent orders of the government, mobilized simultaneously in the north and south to resume business. Last month, it suddenly exceeded 50 million yuan, with sales in North China accounting for 30 million yuan and South China accounting for 20 million yuan. Especially in North China, in addition to using their own diplomatic means, the Japanese also used Chinese political forces to prevent and reject Japanese goods. As a result, the anti-Japanese movement in North China disappeared, and the Japanese were able to make further progress and gain a monopoly on the commercial market. Any British and American goods, whether industrial products, pharmaceuticals, daily necessities, or electrical appliances, that sold well in North China, the Japanese would use dumping tactics to prevent their development. For example, in the case of light bulbs, most of the light bulbs used in North China were domestic products, and well-known light bulbs produced by British and German merchants. Recently, most of them have been Japanese goods. Cases of counterfeiting are endless. The punished are Chinese, but in fact, the Chinese are only working for the benefit of the enemy and are not Chinese products.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Evasion of Customs Duties <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In order to help Chinese industry and commerce defeat European and American industry and commerce, the Japanese use dumping as the only means. However, many goods are limited by cost and cannot be reduced. Therefore, in the Fujian and Guangdong areas, they use complex foreign merchant relationships to collude with Chinese people and organize large-scale tax evasion agencies to reduce tariffs and lower costs. Customs is unable to prevent it.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Promotion Methods <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In order to broaden sales channels, the Japanese use both lending and cheap prices to entice Chinese merchants and traitors to set up sales agencies, hanging up Chinese store signs. There are more than a dozen such stores in Shanghai. There are several or dozens of such stores in Hankou, Jiujiang, Qingdao, Jinan, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, and other places. The method is very convenient. For example, if you purchase 100 yuan of Japanese goods from such a store, you will be charged an additional 5 yuan for insurance. The store is responsible for transporting the goods to the destination. If the goods are seized by the Anti-Japanese Association on the way or at the destination, the store will acknowledge the loss and compensate the full amount. Even if it amounts to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yuan, there will be no objection. The provision of fire and water insurance is especially credible. Most cold-blooded merchants flock to it, and Japanese goods are sold smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Forming Large Companies <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Because Japanese goods have been severely rejected in the British, Indian, and Dutch territories, resulting in significant setbacks, the Japanese manufacturers have urged the government to order Mitsubishi and Mitsui, which are deeply rooted in China, to actively resume import and export trade. This has now become a reality. Furthermore, they plan to set up four large companies in Shanghai, similar in scale to Sincere, Wing On, and Lane Crawford established by the British. They also plan to set up dozens of small-scale department stores, using low prices as a selling point, attempting to monopolize commercial power. This is gradually taking shape, and it is expected that they will all open this year, adding retail aggression to wholesale aggression.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Active Japanese Ships <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of 21 Japanese ships operating on our inland rivers, on six routes: Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Yichang, Hankou-Yichang, Hankou-Changsha, Hankou-Xiangtan, and Yichang-Chongqing. They are all owned by Nissin Kisen Kaisha, with ship names such as Luoyang, Fengyang, Nanyang, Xiangyang, Ruiyang, Dafu, Dali, Dazhen, Daji, Yueyang, Xinyang, Dangyang, Yiyang, Changyang, Chongyang, Daheng, Xiangjiang, Yuanjiang, Wuling, Fuling, and Jialing. After the Shanghai Incident, followed by the war in North China, due to the strong resistance from the Chinese people, except for a few that did not stop to maintain routes, the rest were irregular voyages. Now, they plan to take advantage of the opportunity to gradually recover. In addition to obtaining exclusive transportation rights for Japanese goods on the Yangtze River, they are also secretly recruiting brokers in Shanghai and Hankou to lobby merchants, using the slogan of reducing freight rates. Water and fire insurance are included in the package. Once this campaign is mature, all the ships will be fully restored. It is expected that the shipping industry will undergo drastic changes at that time. If the Chinese people do not quickly sever ties with Japanese goods and Japanese ships, then Chinese money will turn into Japanese guns and cannons to destroy our cities and slaughter our compatriots, and will not stop until we are all killed and exterminated.

<p>On the 24th of last month, Feng Yuxiang sent a respectful telegram to Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, explaining that his anti-Japanese stance did not conflict with the central government. It is also rumored that a national salvation plan is being drafted at the Lushan Conference, and someone will be sent to Lushan to request that it be included in the agenda.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Executive Yuan Decides on Measures for Foreigners to Lease Land <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Strictly Enforce the Provisional Regulations on the Lease of Land and Property</p>
<p>Local Authorities Should Properly Handle Unauthorized Transfers</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau yesterday received an instruction from the Municipal Government, which was forwarded from the Executive Yuan, ordering strict enforcement of the Provisional Regulations on the Lease of Land and Houses by Foreign Churches in the Interior. If Chinese people violate the regulations and transfer land to foreign churches or foreign people without authorization, the local government should handle it carefully and notify the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs for record and verification. The Executive Yuan's circular and the results of the review are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Order from the Executive Yuan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's circular states: "Previously, a letter was received from the Central News Agency Committee, forwarded by the Standing Committee from the Hunan Provincial Executive Committee, stating that it was found that residents in the interior were selling national land to foreign nationals or foreign religious followers, and the government should impose sanctions. Also, if foreigners lease land from residents in the interior, should it be submitted to the local government for approval, and what are the procedures, and are there any relevant legal regulations? The committee did not dare to speculate on the above two points and therefore forwarded the document to request instructions. The Executive Yuan was ordered to investigate and reply. In response, the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Judicial Administration were jointly asked to review and verify the matter. They all stated that foreigners in the interior, except for churches that can use the name of the church to lease land in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on the Lease of Houses by Foreign Churches in the Interior, have no right to lease land. As for residents in the interior who sell national land to foreign nationals or foreign religious followers, in addition to revoking the transfer, the land sellers should be given administrative punishment. However, there are no such regulations in the current laws. Whether punishment should be given and how it should be given should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The above was submitted to the 133rd meeting of the Executive Yuan and resolved to be replied to by the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs. Now, the results of the joint review and verification have been reported. The report was submitted to the 116th meeting of the Executive Yuan, amended, and passed. In addition to sending a letter to the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee for investigation and forwarding to the subordinate local governments, all should comply with the handling."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Review Results <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Chinese people in the interior who transfer land to foreign people or violate the Provisional Regulations on the Lease of Land and Houses by Foreign Churches in the Interior and transfer land to foreign churches should, in principle, be sanctioned. However, there are no regulations in the current laws. It seems that a legislative procedure should be followed to formulate legal regulations for the sanctions. However, this plan must take into account all aspects of the situation and cannot be formulated in a short period of time. Before these regulations are formulated, the Executive Yuan should strictly order the provincial and municipal governments to instruct the local governments to strictly enforce the Provisional Regulations on the Lease of Land and Houses by Foreign Churches in the Interior. If Chinese people violate these regulations or treaties and transfer land to foreign churches or foreign people without authorization, the local government should carefully handle the matter, taking into account the circumstances, and notify the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs for record and verification.</p>

<p>Recommendations from the Industrial Safety Association</p>
<h3 id="e123">Safety and Health Facilities for the Rubber Industry <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Special Committee Approved the Draft Recommendation Yesterday</p>
<p>Clarifying the Causes of Fire and Principles of Fire Prevention</p>
<p>A Total of Twelve Items of Necessary Facilities</p>
<p>After rubber factories such as the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory were successively ordered to suspend work or relocate by the concession authorities due to lack of safety equipment, the Industrial Safety Association, jointly formed by various factories, specially organized a Special Committee for the Rubber Industry to study the facilities that rubber factories should explore to enhance safety and health. The committee met at 3:00 PM yesterday at the association's headquarters on Pupo Road. Committee members Yang Yongnian, Wu Yunxu, Shi Zhiyun, Li Xin, and others attended. They passed a "Draft Recommendation on Safety and Health Facilities for the Rubber Industry." The contents of the recommendation are excerpted below.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Causes of Fire <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The recommendation first states the causes of fire and explosion, saying that rubber factories use a large amount of volatile oil as a solvent for rubber, which increases the chances of fire. The main parts that use this solvent are the mixing department, coating department, shoe pasting department, and painting department. The solvent used by rubber factories in this city is gasoline. If it is allowed to evaporate, when the concentration of the evaporated gas in the air reaches a certain limit, it can explode if there are sparks or flames present. Gas explosions require two conditions: (1) the mixture of gas and air must reach a certain ratio, and (2) there must be a suitable heat source with a high temperature to ignite the gas. When these two conditions exist at the same time, an explosion can be triggered. Other potential causes of fire and explosion include electrical equipment, friction between objects, static electricity, boiling varnish, and pressure vessels.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Principles of Fire Prevention <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The recommendation then discusses the principles of fire prevention, including (1) reducing the evaporation of gasoline, (2) having adequate ventilation in the room to exhaust the evaporated gasoline gas, (3) avoiding the occurrence of sparks, and (4) paying attention to the construction and layout of the factory building so that if a fire occurs in one room, it will not spread to other rooms, and workers must be able to escape to a safe location in a short period of time in the event of a disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e126">A Glimpse of the Recommendations <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Finally, the recommendations are clarified as follows: (1) Emergency exits: Workshops with fewer than 100 workers must have at least two emergency exits. For every additional 50 workers, one additional emergency exit must be added. (2) Emergency ladders: Workplaces above the first floor must have at least two emergency ladders installed in appropriate locations between every two floors, so that workers can escape to a safe location in a short period of time in the event of a disaster. (3) Fire-fighting equipment: Factories must install fire hydrants and fire hoses in appropriate locations. (4) Fire drills: The factory must select capable workers to organize a fire brigade and conduct regular drills. (5) Workshop layout: Oil boiling rooms, steaming rooms, and steam boiler rooms must be separated from other workshops. (6) Electrical equipment: Special attention must be paid to electrical equipment. (7) Belts: To prevent the danger of static electricity, belts must have grounding devices or be coated with a mixture of graphite and resin on the inside of the belt. (8) For sulfur steaming cylinders, each steaming cylinder must be equipped with a lead safety valve and inspected regularly. (9) Coating rooms: The buildings of coating rooms must be built with fire-resistant materials. (10) Shoe pasting department: The arrangement of female workers' work must not be too crowded. (11) Varnish boiling rooms: Hot varnish rooms must be built with fire-resistant materials. (12) Pulping and scraping machines: Pulping and scraping machines must have grounding devices to prevent the generation of static electricity.</p>

<p>After the Emei Ship Hit a Reef</p>
<h3 id="e128">Telegram Sent Yesterday Afternoon Reported Safety <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Passengers Delivered to Yichang, Goods Slightly Water-Damaged</p>
<p>Anchored at the Original Location for Initial Repairs Before Determining a Plan</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Chongqing-class river steamer Emei, which departed from Chongqing on the 26th of last month loaded with passengers and goods destined for Yichang, hit a reef in the Fuling area downstream of Chongqing. After efforts to rescue it, it was freed yesterday morning and is undergoing dewatering and repairs. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Telegram Reported Safety <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Merchants General Bureau received a telegram from the Emei ship yesterday afternoon, informing that the Emei ship, after running aground on a reef, was rescued by a barge sent from Yichang with various rescue equipment. Initially, due to the damage to the bottom of the ship and the intrusion of river water, in order to avoid sinking, the crew actively used machinery to pump water and transferred the passengers to the barge to go to Yichang. They then tried to unload the cargo to reduce the weight and continue the rescue. It was not until yesterday morning that the ship was freed from danger. After the second high tide, it was able to leave the stranded area.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Undergoing Repairs <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The bottom of the Emei ship has been damaged. First, cement will be used to seal the damaged area. The passengers have been rescued and arrived in Yichang. About half of the cargo has been unloaded, and the bottom of the hold has been water-damaged. After the dewatering is completed, repairs will be carried out to seal the damaged area. The extent of the damage will then be inspected to determine the repair plan. It is said that it will be towed to Shanghai for repairs in a shipyard, as there is no shipyard in the area for repairs.</p>
<p>Yesterday Afternoon, the China Merchants Electric Company</p>
<h3 id="e131">Oil Storage Tank Lost Caution <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, Rescue Was Effective and Did Not Cause a Major Disaster</p>
<p>Mobil Oil Company Has Sent Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate</p>
<p>Two gasoline storage tanks (also known as pumps) installed outside the lines of the workers of the China Merchants Electric Company were placed by the Asia Petroleum and Mobil Oil companies. The gasoline needed by the China Merchants Company is supplied by these two companies, twice a month. Each time, the companies' specially made oil tankers are used for transportation, and then the gasoline is pumped into the storage tanks using belts. At 2:40 yesterday afternoon, Mobil Oil Company delivered the first shipment of gasoline for August, totaling 1,500 gallons, but only half of it (750 gallons) was delivered to the China Merchants Company. When the tanker arrived at the China Merchants Company, the gasoline was pumped into the tank using a belt as usual. Unexpectedly, during the pumping process, the belt suddenly caught fire, and the fire was very fierce. Fortunately, there were many workers at the China Merchants Company. Seeing that the situation was not good, they quickly moved the Mobil Oil tanker away. At the same time, a worker from Mobil Oil Company removed the belt, but the fire was too fierce, and sparks flew into the Asia Petroleum storage tank. Fortunately, there was very little oil in the tank, and no major disaster occurred. Only part of the tank was destroyed, and most of the straw shed between the lines of the workers of the China Merchants Company was burned down. At the same time, fire engines from all districts arrived after hearing the alarm and made every effort to extinguish the fire. The head of the Second District Police Station detained the Mobil Oil Company delivery worker. At about 5:00 PM, Mobil Oil Company sent a Western employee to the China Merchants Company to investigate the truth and released the worker on bail.</p>

<p>The Deceased Was a Korean Man Named Yu Hui Guan</p>
<p>The Murderer Has Not Been Caught, and the Reason Is Unknown</p>
<p>Yu Hui Guan, a comprador of the Sande Foreign Firm at No. 112 Sichuan Road, was 43 years old and lived at No. 164 Tongji Road, Zhabei. At about 9:00 last night, he went to the Central Western Restaurant on Simalu for a banquet at the invitation of a friend. Yu rode in his own car, with license plate No. 3572 and city license plate No. 5610, driven by the driver Ding Jintao. After arriving at the restaurant, Yu saw that his friends were gathered there, and after being greeted by the host, he took his seat. At 11:00, the party ended. Yu then ordered the driver to drive to No. 8 Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession, to the home of his brother Yu Guanbin. When the car arrived at the entrance of the Yongda Nanhua Store at No. 210 Wangzhi Road, the driver stopped the engine, and Yu got out of the car calmly. Unexpectedly, after walking a few steps,</p>

<p>Lions, Tigers, Leopards, Bears, Deer, Foxes, Rabbits, Peacocks, etc., Nothing Was Lacking</p>
<p>The Zoo Site Is Still Too Small, and Land Has Been Purchased to Prepare for Expansion</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo officially opened yesterday. The opening hours are from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:30 PM every day. Yesterday, because it was the first time it was opened, the number of visitors was very enthusiastic, and no opening ceremony was held. People were allowed to enter and visit after purchasing tickets. The ticket price was six copper coins for adults and three copper coins for children. A permanent pass costs one yuan per year. The reporter</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Opening of the Municipal Zoo (Photo by Xu Tianzhang) <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Specially went to observe yesterday, and its various situations are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e135">A Glimpse of the Zoo <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The zoo faces the Confucian Temple and was originally the site of a military radio station. The buildings and gardens were dilapidated. After reconstruction, they were completely renovated. The drooping green willows, the sparkling deep pool, the waterside pavilion, the thatched cottage, the rockery, and the winding paths are all like paintings. Although the area is not large, it has its own unique charm. The planners have put a lot of effort into the arrangement. The party and national flags are crossed outside the gate, and the entrance and exit are orderly. The opening rules are posted outside, and there are police officers and zoo staff to maintain order.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Animals in General <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The animals in the zoo, in addition to the few transferred from the former Public School Garden, are all newly purchased. There are lions, tigers, leopards, bears, deer, foxes, rabbits, wild boars, monkeys, apes, kangaroos, ostriches, peacocks, white cranes, thrushes, and other kinds of mountain birds and domestic animals. They are now placed in various pavilions and sheds. It is said that a large elephant was purchased before and was shipped to Hong Kong, but the elephant suddenly had a foot ailment and was temporarily shipped back. There are also aquatic animals, with five crocodiles being purchased. There is one snake, but because it is not easy to raise and can only live for a maximum of one year, it has not yet been prepared. Currently, there is only one kangaroo among the tropical animals, placed in a house equipped with a hot water heater.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Preparing for Expansion <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The reporter met with Mr. Shen Xiangrui, the director of the zoo's preparation, and Mr. Lu Hailan, the supervisor of the Mass Education Section of the Education Bureau. According to them, the zoo site is still too small. There is a private vacant lot of about six or seven mu to the west of the zoo, which has been decided to be purchased for expansion. The transaction will be completed soon. The houses behind the zoo, near the Panfang area, were originally the property of the Confucian Temple and will also be recovered in the future, and the houses will be demolished to expand the zoo's site.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Supplementary Ceremony <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony has not yet been held. The date of the supplementary ceremony has not yet been determined. Because the Municipal Mass Education Center and the Municipal Library have been working for a long time, they have not yet held a ceremony. In the future, a date must be chosen to hold a large-scale ceremony in conjunction with the zoo.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a violent man fired a shot. The bullet hit his back and penetrated his chest, and Yu fell to the ground and died. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the murderer left. After the police arrived, the murderer had already disappeared. They had to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall and wait for the court to examine it this morning. The deceased's brother, Yu Guanbin, and the driver, Ding Jintao, reported to the French police station and asked for the arrest. It is said that the deceased had a six-inch Browning pistol with him, but he did not use it because he did not have time to retaliate.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Yu Feng Yarn Factory Announces Shutdown <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The board of directors of the Yu Feng Yarn Factory announced that due to the lack of cotton and the significant operating losses over the past six months, the factory will cease operations from 6:00 AM on July 29 of this year. Under these difficult circumstances, in accordance with Article 30 of the Factory Law, which provides for the termination of contracts, the factory is completely terminating the employment contracts of all workers in the factory from today. All previous conditions agreed upon between the factory and the workers and the union are also completely canceled. In accordance with Article 29 of the Factory Law, in addition to paying the workers the wages they are due, the factory will also pay the wages for the advance notice period specified in Article 27 of the same law as follows: (1) Those who have worked continuously in the factory for more than three months but less than one year will be paid an additional ten days' wages. (2) Those who have worked continuously in the factory for more than one year but less than two years will be paid an additional twenty days' wages. (3) Those who have worked continuously in the factory for more than three years will be paid an additional thirty days' wages. In addition, special expenses, such as bathhouse and school subsidies, will be suspended from today. The factory hopes to resume operations as soon as possible within the scope of operational and economic feasibility, but it must be stated in advance that the high cost of expenditure is one of the reasons for the factory's significant losses. Future work plans must be completely reorganized to increase work efficiency and reduce waste. If this is not done, it will not be possible to resume work and achieve the hope of continuing to maintain the factory. The wages and the amount of work will be determined separately when the reorganization is carried out. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3 id="e140">It is Rumored that the Grand Prize Winner Is a Russian Woman <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>丨Second Phase of Tickets Sold in Installments, Lottery to be Drawn at the End of October丨</p>
<p>The first phase of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery of the National Government was drawn at the Yiyuan the other day. It is rumored that the grand prize was won by a foreign lady living in Shanghai. The second phase will be sold in installments. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Special Prize Winner <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The first-issue special prize number 299287, was sold by the Shanghai Bank on July 26th at 10:00 AM, through the Da Yun Company. According to the Da Yun Company's announcement yesterday to the reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency, the special prize winner is a foreign lady, transliterated as Pei Er Ke, residing at 323 Route Lafayette in the French Concession. It is heard she is of Russian nationality. However, when this company sent personnel to inquire, there was no such person at that address. As for whether she won 500,000 yuan independently, or jointly, it is impossible to ascertain at this time because the date for claiming the prize is from August 8th.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Second Prize Winner <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>There were two second prizes. Number 263867 was sold at the Da Fu Lai store front through Da Yun Company. The winner is Chinese, but their name is unknown as they have not yet claimed the prize. Number 16914 was directly mailed by Da Yun Company to a Chinese person in Harbin. The company wired a notification yesterday. Also, yesterday at 1:30 PM, a Chinese man and woman suddenly came to the Da Yun Company on Sichuan Road, claiming that ticket number 226622, the first prize ticket, was won by them. However, the ticket was with a friend. When they questioned why it was marked as unsold, the reporter happened to be present and found their crazed demeanor frightening. It was later learned that this person suffered a significant economic blow after buying 150 yuan worth of lottery tickets and not winning, leading to a nervous breakdown. The person left only after the staff explained extensively.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Second Issue Release <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Prize-winning tickets from the first issue can be fully redeemed by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Three Banks from August 8th of this month until January 30th of the 23rd year. As for the second issue, the details have been decided, but sales will commence after the first issue's prizes are settled. The lottery draw is scheduled for October 31st, and the procedures will remain the same as before.</p>
<p>Reaching the hope of continuing to maintain this factory, future wages and work quantities will be determined separately during the reorganization. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>To all shops in the Concession:</p>
<h3 id="e144">Old Account Books Must Affix Revenue Stamps <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Otherwise, upon detection, penalties will be imposed according to regulations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to all trade associations, stating: "Regarding the matter of revenue stamps for invoices and account books of shops in the concessions, as per the Ministry of Finance's approval, those that have not been affixed with revenue stamps or have been affixed with an insufficient amount after November 1st of the 18th year should be supplemented to the full amount according to regulations to avoid penalties. This matter is somewhat harsh, and we request your efforts to contend for exemption." After sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting permission to waive the retroactive surcharge, on the 31st of this month, we received a reply, document number 3060, which stated: "After the implementation of the Revenue Stamp Regulations, any invoices or account books established that do not comply with the affixing of revenue stamps, whenever detected, shall be penalized according to regulations. The Ministry is deeply concerned that merchants may misunderstand the law and not understand the principle of not pursuing past offenses and hopes to be exempt from penalties. A clear explanation has already been given, and all merchants have been ordered to affix them promptly, which is already exceptionally lenient. Now, the request from the Sino-Foreign General Merchandise Trade Association to exempt merchants from affixing revenue stamps to old, discarded invoices and account books that have been set aside before the issuance of the previous approval is even more unreasonable and difficult to approve. It should still be handled in accordance with the previous approval. If they do not quickly affix revenue stamps, they will be executed according to regulations once detected. Do not blame yourselves. You should forward this together to all merchants for compliance, etc." Upon receiving this, we hereby send a notice. We hope you will comply."</p>
<p>Tongyang Steamship Companies Cooperate</p>
<h3 id="e145">Establishing a Joint Business Office <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Abolishing Price-Cutting Competition</p>
<p>Implementing Public Operation</p>
<p>Jiangbei agricultural products are shipped to Shanghai in large quantities every year. There are two steamship companies in Shanghai, Dada and Datong, which operate ships to various ports in Tongyang. However, in recent years, due to excessive competition, they have been reducing freight rates and secretly giving rebates to each other, which has led to chaotic operations and reduced income. This year, the shipping business on this route has also been relatively quiet. The authorities of the two companies believe that constantly competing by cutting prices is akin to suicide, so they have decided to cooperate in operation, following the example of the six Shanghai-Taiwan companies, to save the shipping industry in a public manner. Yesterday, the two companies established a joint office, and shipping magnates in Shanghai all attended to participate. Details are described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Motive for the Union <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Tongyang shipping route originally belonged to Dada Company alone, founded by Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong, and the wharf in Nanshi was also built by Mr. Zhang to develop Jiangbei transportation and transport products to Shanghai. Later, Mr. Lu Bohong also organized the Datong Company to operate on the Tongyang route, and the shipping industry on the Jiangbei route began to compete. Initially, they reduced water freight, and then offered rebates, hoping to increase freight volume, but as a result, the shipping companies' income decreased daily. Four years ago, the two companies proposed cooperation but failed. This year, affected by the commercial downturn, the two companies revived the old proposal and decided to abandon their past mutually-opposed stance and implement cooperation. After discussions between Zhang Xiaoruo, Lu Bohong, etc., they jointly established the Dada Datong Joint Office to develop the shipping industry in a public manner.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Establishment of the Office <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Dada and Datong Companies joined hands to establish a joint office on the upper floor of the Flour Exchange on Min Guo Road, and each side appointed Zhang Xiaoruo, Lu Bohong, Xu Yihe, Yang Guanbei, Yang Zaitian, Mao Youren, etc. as directors of the board to manage the affairs of the joint office. An audit section was added, with accountant Li Yunliang organizing it. The duties of the joint office are to make freight rates public and unify accounting. The office was formally established at 10:00 AM yesterday, and all directors and important personnel of the two companies attended the opening ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Report from the Chairman <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>At the opening ceremony, Mr. Du Yuesheng, director of Dada, was publicly elected to deliver a speech. Mr. Du stated that the cooperation between Dada and Datong is to seek the welfare of the people of Tongyang and that everything is done publicly, not monopolistically. Then, Yang Zaitian of Datong reported on the preparations for the cooperation between the two companies and the direction of progress. Chief Auditor Li Yunliang then elaborated on the fact that the joint office was established on the basis of public water freight rates, unified accounting, and improved and expanded operations.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Speeches from Guests <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The guests who arrived were important figures from the shipping, finance, and yarn mill industries. Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, took the lead in speaking, detailing the success and benefits of cooperative businesses in England, America, Japan, and Germany. Mr. Liu spoke from his own experience and observations, making it personal and insightful. He said that America's wealth and strength lie in the cooperation of various industries, such as steel, iron, oil, etc. Even small cigarette paper stores in America have a large union of 226,000 stores. In Japan, even small vendors must unite. There are even more cooperative businesses in England and France. Mr. Liu also gave examples. He then said that in China, during the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Cheng Zhong had the largest business in Shanghai, but it did not last long due to a lack of cooperation. He also said that the Chinese silk mills were the least established and lacked unity, resulting in failure. Finally, he spoke highly about the failure of his own match business due to a lack of unity and the success after uniting. Mr. Liu said that business cooperation can reduce costs and eliminate various expenses, and he hopes that Dada and Datong will progress from cooperation to merger, which will surely lead to faster development. Mr. Qiaolao also gave a speech, praising the various benefits of the union and emphasizing that it is definitely not a monopoly. There were many other speakers, which are not fully recorded.</p>

<p>Within the joint office, an arbitration committee was also formed to resolve disputes between the two companies. The arbitration committee will make public decisions. Li Yunhou, Xi Yushu, Gao Yangzhi, and Lu Xie Rong have been appointed as arbitration committee members. The organization and responsibilities of the committee will be detailed in separate rules.</p>
<h3 id="e151">New Operating Policies <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Dada and Datong Companies each have four steamships on the Tongyang route. Dada has Daqing, Dayu, Dahe, and Guangxiang, and Datong has Hongda, Longda, Zhida, and Zhengda. After the joint office was established, it was agreed that each company would operate one ship each day. The previous practices of price-cutting and secret rebates will be completely stopped. Freight rates will be set by the committee and publicly followed. There will be no more private price reductions or increased rebates. The cargo manifests of each ship from both companies will be exchanged, and the accounting of the two companies will be calculated and publicly announced by the chief auditor. However, matters such as cabin positions and ticket sales for each ship from both companies will be handled separately and will not involve the joint office.</p>

The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM. The operations of the two companies have been jointly managed since yesterday.</p>

<p>Diviner Repeatedly Writes Intimidation Letters</p>
<p>Two Criminals Arrested and Sentenced to One and a Half Years of Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>丨 Diviner Sentenced to Four Months of Imprisonment 丨</p>
<p>Gu Pinjian, a native of Jiading, runs the Yongtai Yarn Shop at number 19 Yongkang Lane, Beijing Road. On July 13th of this year, someone suddenly threw an intimidation letter through the window. After Gu unfolded it, the words inside were fierce and sought to extort 10,000 yuan in foreign currency. If he did not agree, his two sons would be in danger in the future, and it would be impossible to redeem them even with tens of thousands of gold. Therefore, he was notified in advance. If he was willing to discuss the payment, he could write the words "Shang Da" (上大) on the door; if not, he could write "Zhong Da" (中大). After receiving the letter, Gu was extremely frightened and reported it to the Laozha Gate Police Station. The head of the police station ordered him to follow the instructions in the letter and write "Shang Da" (上大) on the door.</p>

<p>After the criminal gang found　　out, they immediately　　notified Gu Pinjian by telephone,　　limiting him to send the money to the paper waste container next to the urinal in the Weianfang Lane, Haining Road, between 8 and 9 PM on July 16th. Gu reported to the police station again and ordered a large number of Chinese detectives to disguise themselves as workers, wearing old and tattered short clothes, and go to Weianfang to wait. They either lay down or stood, secretly observing the movements. However, the criminal gang was quite alert. Although they had once wandered around the area, they saw people lying on the ground in the lane and suspected they were detectives, so they hesitated and turned back.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Detectives Wait All Night <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Unable to obtain anything, they also retreated. On the 17th, the criminal　　gang sent another letter, posting　　it on the door of Yongtai Yarn　　Shop, and changed the meeting place to number 10 Zhenghou Lane, Xiamen Road. After Gu reported to the police and detectives were sent, they did not meet again. Later, the criminal gang changed its strategy and threatened Gu by telephone, reaching more than ten times a day, demanding money and gradually reducing the amount from 10,000 yuan to 500 yuan. However, Gu's business has been slow lately, and he could not afford it, so he still ignored them. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chinese detective Shen Dehui and Western detective Heideng of the Huishi Police Station learned of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Extortionist from Tongzhou <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xuecheng (also known as Wang Haihai) and Wang Maosi　　had to pass through Xiamen Road　　Zhejiang Road. Therefore,　　they went to arrest the two Wangs, took them to the police station, and interrogated them. The Wangs confessed that the two extortion letters were written by Qian Hongsi, a native of Zhenjiang who set up a divination stall at Tangjia Long in Ximen. The detectives immediately went with the police detectives from the Public Security Bureau to arrest Qian and take him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were jointly brought before the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang rose and detailed the above situation, saying that the three defendants were being prosecuted under Article 370, Section 3 of the Criminal Law for attempted extortion through intimidation, and requested that they be severely punished. Gu Jinshi, the plaintiff, said that Gu Pinjian is my husband, and after receiving the extortion letter, he was afraid, so he had already</p>

<p>To avoid temporarily. She also　　described the situation,　　saying that the second defendant,　　Wang Maosi, used to be a　　substitute rickshaw puller at my place, so he knew my family situation in detail. Now that he has been arrested, please punish him according to the law. The defendant Wang Xuecheng confessed that because Wang Maosi used to work as a servant in Gu's house and knew that Gu was wealthy, he wanted to write a letter to borrow money. He discussed it with me at a certain alley entrance on Xiamen Road. I spent 24 copper coins at Qian Hongsi's divination stall to write a letter. Wang Maosi and I went to the door of Gu's house and threw the letter in from the window, demanding 10,000 yuan in foreign currency. A few days later, I spent 20 copper coins to ask Qian to write another letter, which I sent.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Pasted on Gu's Door <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Wang Maosi did not go this time　　because he feared that his face would　　be recognized by Gu's family.　　I made the phone calls five or six　　times, etc. Wang Maosi confessed that in May of this year, I worked as a rickshaw puller in Gu's house. However, this matter was initiated by Wang Xuecheng. All the writing and sending of letters were done by Xuecheng. I did not go. Qian Hongsi confessed that I set up a divination stall at Tangjia Long Xiaocai Lane. Wang Xuecheng came and asked me to write two letters. The language in the letters mainly asked to borrow 10,000 yuan in foreign currency. If he did not agree, he would kidnap his children. I only received 440 wen in writing fees, etc. Judge Guigui verified the confessions and announced the verdict in court, sentencing the defendants Wang Xuecheng and Wang Maosi jointly to one and a half years of imprisonment for the crime of attempted extortion by intimidation. Qian Hongsi was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for assisting in attempted extortion. The extortion letters were confiscated.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 PM last night, a　　certain chair shop in Tangshan　　Lane, Tangshan Road, caught fire　　due to negligence, causing a conflagration. At the same time, it spread to the neighbors. Nearby police officers noticed it and urgently reported to the Hongkou Fire Brigade. The fire trucks were dispatched to put out the fire. Due to the dilapidated houses and dry weather, the fire spread easily and was difficult to extinguish for a time. It was not extinguished until around 1:00 AM this morning. A total of more than ten houses were destroyed.</p>

<p>Suspension for One Time Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ningbo ship, Xin Jiangtian, suffered sudden damage to its engine room boiler on its return to Shanghai from Yong. After the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, the owner reported to the General Bureau that the boiler was damaged and could not sail, and urgently needed repair. Liu Hongsheng immediately ordered the shipping department to put Xin Jiangtian into the dock for repairs immediately. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday, but due to the lack of ships available for dispatch within the Bureau to replace it, it had to be temporarily suspended once. It will resume sailing on the 4th after the repairs are completed.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Wine Merchants Telegraph the Tax Affairs Department</p>
<h3 id="e164">Request a Delay in Implementing the Fixed-Quota Tax on Native Wine <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Shaoxing wine merchants, including Shen Yonghe, collectively telegraphed the Ministry of Finance's Tax Affairs Department yesterday regarding the implementation of the fixed-quota tax on native wine in the seven provinces, which has severely impacted the industry. The telegram stated: "Shaoxing wine is sold throughout the provinces, and its taxes are the highest in the country. Those who bear this huge tax burden are almost all Shaoxing farmers. Shaoxing farmers have historically relied on planting rice and brewing wine for their livelihood. Recently, the rural economy has collapsed, and Shaoxing wine is heavily taxed and slow to sell, often reaching the brink of disaster. The Ministry of Finance is piloting the fixed-quota tax on native wine in the seven provinces, scheduled to be implemented in the winter. A large-scale reform of the tax system and unification of tax revenue should not be interfered with. However, after detailed translation of the regulations, a system of separate collection of production and sales taxes has been established. Tax types in both locations must be balanced. Shanghai is the only sales market for Shaoxing wine, and its sales tax exceeds the production tax by as much as one-third. Suffering this blow, the outlet will inevitably shrink. Moreover, it is well known throughout the country that the older the wine is brewed, the better it is. The shipping deadline is limited to six months, which will eliminate aged wine from the market, resulting in production without sales, and the production quota will inevitably decrease. Saving the national economy and the people's livelihood will have the opposite effect. In particular, affixing tax stamps to a single container often requires as many as three or four stamps, or two or three stamps, forming no distinction and eliminating the perfect old system of one stamp per container. The government only wastes labor and materials, and brewers are most likely to make mistakes, and mistakes will lead to heavy penalties. In addition, all wines that have been affixed with old stamps before this day must be returned and exchanged for new tax stamps on the spot, which is cumbersome and difficult to handle, and is the most excessive harassment. And officials say that it is as easy as lifting a hand, but the law does not apply retroactively. Now, returning old and exchanging new ones requires supplementing some taxes, which is no different from double taxation. These few points are all obstructive and difficult to implement, and the remaining inconsistencies are too numerous to mention. Considering the efforts to alleviate the decline of the rural economy, the whole country is working together to reverse the situation, and Shaoxing farmers are in deep trouble, with only skin and bones left, how can they bear further destruction? We feel deeply pained and cannot remain silent. In addition to submitting a detailed report separately and publicly electing representatives to go to Beijing to petition, we hereby collectively telegraph, begging you to review and quickly suspend the implementation of the new Shaoxing wine regulations, while adopting public opinion, understanding the inconveniences, and allowing separate revisions. We hope to increase tax revenue and care for the people, and allow the regulations to be implemented without obstacles. We anxiously await your orders. Respectfully, Shaoxing Wine Merchants Shen Yonghe, Liu Hexing, Qian Yu, Yue Xing, Yunji, Tang Yuanyuan, Lin Yongyuan, Yu Xiaozhen, Qian Yu Cui, Wang Songmao, Zhang Wanrun, Ye Wanyuan, Zhang Huanji, Zhang Dongming Zhengji, etc."</p>

<p>Saving Provincial Funds to Purchase Equipment</p>
<p>Starting to Recruit Forensic Medicine Researchers</p>
<p>The Zhenru Institute of Forensic Medicine has been established for one year, and its internal equipment and detailed planning have been praised by the general public and domestic and foreign experts. August 1st marked the anniversary of the establishment of the institute. The director of the institute, Lin Ji, reported on the facilities established over the past year. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e166">Holding a Commemorative Ceremony <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday, the institute held a one-week commemorative ceremony. The ceremony was quite grand. All personnel of the institute attended. Director Lin Ji presided over the ceremony. After performing the rituals, Mr. Lin reported on the facilities established since the establishment of the Institute of Forensic Medicine. Then, people from all walks of life expressed their opinions on forensic medicine and encouraged the institute not to interrupt its work. Their words were very pertinent. Finally, the director stood up to deliver a reply. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM after taking a group photo.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Increase Research Equipment <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Director Lin reported yesterday that the establishment of this institute coincided with the time of national crisis, and the national economy was very depressed. Therefore, the start-up funds for this institute were only more than 20,000 yuan, and the monthly recurring expenses were only more than 4,000 yuan. However, the various facilities and equipment purchases for this institute required funds, which led to extreme difficulties. With the encouragement of colleagues, we tried our best to save expenses, and in one year, we added a mortuary, water table, weighing room, pharmacy, bacteria and serum testing center, animal breeding room, library, printing office, research practice room, etc., and purchased more than 2,000 yuan in equipment and more than 1,500 yuan in medicines, which is how we achieved today's scale.</p>
<h3 id="e168">One Year of Work <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>As for the responsibilities of this institute, they are originally divided into four major tasks: ㈠ identifying and examining cases, ㈡ educating and cultivating forensic medicine talents, ㈢ researching issues related to forensic medicine, ㈣ compiling and translating forms and books related to forensic medicine. In this year, we accepted about 85 difficult cases for identification and examination from various courts, 2,183 ordinary cases, and less than 20 cases from private individuals and groups. As for education, we have now started to recruit 40 researchers, and classes are scheduled to start on September 1. Research work includes the impracticality of using silver needles to detect poison and methods for investigating smoking offenders, etc., and there are many other ongoing research and invention projects. Translation work has not been realized in the past year due to the small number of staff and the intensive work. If the budget can be increased this year, there can also be considerable contributions.</p>

<p>In addition to the technicians at the institute, all technical personnel at this institute also have more than 20 honorary technical commissioners, all of whom are among the best experts in the country. Recently, we have also established close ties with the Natural Science Institute and the Lister Institute, and we plan to cooperate with foreign specialists in China. In short, we are trying our best to find new ways to promote the four major tasks that this institute is responsible for.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Ciyou Jiaoyang Institute was established by the Chinese Ciyou Association. Its purpose is to take in orphans and widows who are homeless and give them education and training so that they can become independent. In addition, honest and reliable men and women without children are allowed to adopt them to alleviate social problems. Since its establishment, four years have passed in an instant. Hundreds of children have been educated and trained. There are still more than 70 boys and girls in the institute, and the results are quite good. Recently, Ms. Liu Jinfang was hired as the director of the institute. Since taking office, Ms. Liu has been determined to improve the institute's affairs. Because the original site (number 93 Huishan Road) is insufficient, it is heard that it was relocated to number 1052 Tangshan Road, a Western-style house that was formerly the residence of Tan Yankai, the President of the Executive Yuan. The houses there are spacious and the air is fresh, which is very suitable for the children's environment.</p>

<h3 id="e173">The Editor-in-Chief of the Java Chinese Newspaper Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The "Java Chinese Newspaper" of Batavia, Dutch East Indies, was founded by local overseas Chinese. Since its publication, it has been popular throughout the South Seas islands. Almost all Dutch residents, including women and children, know the name of this newspaper. Usually, if the local government took any action unfavorable to overseas Chinese, the newspaper would argue based on reason. If any overseas Chinese did not understand the situation in their motherland and misunderstandings arose, the newspaper would do its best to explain. Last spring, during the January 28th Incident, the newspaper made great efforts to encourage overseas Chinese to donate money to save the country. In the past year, according to statistics, the donations remitted to the country through the newspaper's publicity from Java Island alone amounted to no less than one million yuan. It has been found that the greatest achievement of the newspaper is its promotion of overseas Chinese patriotism. The overseas Chinese born in the Dutch East Indies are enthusiastic about their motherland and are regarded as the best in the South Seas Islands. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Mr. Guo Keming, is a Java-born Chinese whose ancestral home is in Fujian. He graduated from a Dutch normal school and is proficient in Dutch, German, English, and Malay. Although he has not received education in China, he is extremely protective of his motherland. Everyone says that the new newspaper's achievements could not have been achieved without his perseverance and struggle against the adverse environment. Mr. Guo recently observed that the commercial and industrial situation in Nanyang is declining. He believed that this was an opportunity to encourage overseas Chinese to return to China to invest in and operate industrial enterprises. He specially requested a five-week leave to return to China in person for investigation. He arrived in Shanghai on the Dutch ship "Tsibadak" on the 29th of last month and stayed at the Wai Tan (Bund) Huizhong Hotel. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately rushed to Nanjing to inspect all the construction of the capital. One morning, he went to Hangzhou for sightseeing. It is heard that he will only stay in Shanghai for a few days and then take the original ship back to Xiamen. Yesterday, Mr. Liu Shimu of the Cultural Department of Jinan University and Mr. Huang Jiping of Shen Bao accompanied him to visit various places. Many other newly arrived overseas Chinese also traveled with them. It is heard that the overseas Chinese community in Shanghai plans to hold a grand welcome party to express their welcome, and hopes that Mr. Guo will stay a few more days to communicate with cultural groups in Shanghai, in order to facilitate the emotional connection between China and Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The reason was fear of being killed, so they struck first.</p>
<p>The debate ended yesterday and a judgment is scheduled.</p>
<p>Zhang Xinshan, a secret agent of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Detective Team No. 62 from Anhui Province, nicknamed "Little Anhui," was stabbed to death by multiple knives at 8:45 AM on the 5th of last month at the entrance of Lane 1, Chongyi Lane, No. 459 Bailaini Mengma Road in the French Concession. He was stabbed 21 times. The Public Security Bureau Detective Team, together with Jin Jiulin, the chief inspector of the special agency of the French Concession Patrol Station, etc., successively arrested the principal criminals Cai Decai, Guo Shanyu, and Guo Yushan from Anhui Province in a straw shed behind Mintini Yin Road and Pudong Guanghua Oil Station, and Pingliang Road. They were first taken away by the Public Security Bureau, interrogated, and then transferred to the French Concession Patrol Station and escorted to the Second Special District Local Court for investigation and detention. At 11:00 AM yesterday, acting Judge Wu Fangqian presided over the trial in the Criminal Court No. 1. The bailiffs brought the defendants to the defendant's column, and Zhang Xinyun, the brother of the deceased, also came to court to await the trial. First, the Patrol Station's lawyer, Yao Zhaodi, described the Patrol Station's investigation, stating that the three defendants were arrested by the Public Security Bureau for the case of the secret agent of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhang Xinshan. The Patrol Station has found that the defendants are indeed the murderers of Zhang. According to the confession of the first defendant, Li Decai, the deceased killed their old man Huang Haiqing (Note: Huang was the detective of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Water Police Team, stationed in Wusong) at the entrance of Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road on August 6, 1931, under the instigation of Liu Delong, who is still at large. The deceased, now a secret agent of the Public Security Bureau, knew that they were disciples of Huang and would be detrimental to them, so they struck first, colluding with the second and third defendants, Guo Shanyu and Guo Yushan, to wait with Liu at the entrance of Chongyi Lane, Malang Road on the morning of July 5. The two knives and the pistol held by Guo Yushan were all Liu's property. When the deceased passed through the lane entrance, Guo Yushan used his gun to block him, and he and Guo Shanyu stepped forward and stabbed Zhang to death with knives. Liu kept watch on the side. The murder weapon left behind was given to them by Liu. The second and third defendants also confessed to jointly participating in the murder. Now, the Patrol Station is prosecuting the defendants for premeditated murder under Article 284, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and requests the court to punish them according to law. He also presented a murder weapon seized by the Patrol Station next to the corpse to the court. Then, Bao Tan (police detective) Cai Jinzhang reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. Zhang Xinyun, the brother of the deceased, also stated the tragic death of the deceased and requested a severe punishment. After the court reviewed the report, it ordered the police to take the defendants down and question them separately one by one. The three defendants all confessed that they were instigated by Liu Delong, who is still at large, to go and commit the murder. The court then appointed lawyer Zhu Taiqing to debate with the Patrol Station's lawyer on behalf of the defendants. After the debate, the court ordered the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced on August 7. The defendants were still remanded to the Patrol Station to await instructions. The court adjourned after noon.</p>

<p>Those Who Fail One Subject Besides Chinese, English, Math, Physics, and Chemistry</p>
<p>May Be Issued Certificates for Advance Enrollment as Probationary Students</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau yesterday instructed private colleges and universities and private middle schools at all levels in the city participating in this year's high school graduation examination, stating: "Regarding the Ministry of Education's Instruction No. 7394, Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, Fujian Provincial Education Department, and Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have successively reported that they request temporary approval to issue certificates to students who failed the middle school graduation examination repeater courses so that they can apply for colleges and universities. The Ministry has reviewed the situation and found that the middle school graduation examinations in various provinces and cities are being conducted earnestly, so there are still a considerable number of students who failed the repeater courses. In order to assist the majority of young people so that they can continue their education, special flexible measures will be taken this year. For all students in the high school graduation examination, if they fail one subject after retaking the course, other than the five subjects of Chinese, English, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, the Bureau will issue a certificate to allow them to apply for colleges and universities first. After being admitted, they will be treated as probationary students. After passing the examination in each failed subject in the next high school graduation examination, a high school diploma will be issued. After verification by the colleges and universities where they are studying, they will be treated as regular students. Students who fail the junior high school graduation examination and apply for higher education with equivalent qualifications are free to do so without the need for a separate certificate. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for your information and for you to instruct your subordinates accordingly." Therefore, in addition to printing certificates for application and issuance, this order is hereby issued for your information.</p>

<p>The Shanghai University Student Union organized a national salvation propaganda team during the summer vacation, which went to various places to work very hard. All teams in Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu have successively departed and arrived in various places to conduct oral and written propaganda, which is quite popular among the people. It is reported that the work of the Third Team (Anhui Team) has been completed. The team leader, Yang De'an, led all team members back to Shanghai by ship. After landing, each team member went to the general headquarters of the University Union Propaganda Team to report on the work in Anhui in great detail. According to the team leader, Yang De'an, who spoke to a Shanghai News reporter, the propaganda team, after arriving in Anhui, immediately divided into urban and rural groups for the convenience of work, and appointed Zhang Hao and Hong Xiao Chen as the leaders of each group. Then, they led the team to work in various places. The rural group paid special attention to propaganda in rural areas, so they gained the sympathy of the general farmers. The urban group gave popular lectures in busy towns more than ten times, with a total audience of no less than 50,000 to 60,000 people. They are currently compiling a detailed work report.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Reaction to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Not Recruiting Agricultural Students <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Mu Ouchu and Others Wrote to Question</p>
<p>Request Adding Two Agricultural Students</p>
<p>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund's board of directors has decided to select 20 students to study in the UK, which has attracted the attention of the academic community. However, upon investigation, all subjects in natural and social sciences are available, but the agricultural subject, which is deeply related to China, is missing. Agricultural leaders Mu Ouchu, Shao Bingwen, Cai Wuji, and twenty to thirty others have specifically raised objections to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee on this matter. The original manuscript is excerpted below.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Letter from Mu Ouchu et al. <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully, we recently read in the newspaper that your committee's 17th board meeting decided to send 20 students to study in the UK with Boxer Indemnity funds. The subjects of study include English literature, Western history, law, politics, mathematics, geography, geodesy, medicine, public health, civil engineering, and other disciplines, but agricultural science is missing. Recently, the social clamor for rural revitalization has been rampant, and the government has specific organizations to promote it, which is more important than any other discipline. If agricultural science is missing, it seems inappropriate from a pragmatic point of view. Moreover, China's rural revitalization is extremely tense, and there is a shortage of talent. The British agricultural experiment stations are advanced in all countries. Sending students to study agriculture in the UK with Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds will have a greater effect than other disciplines. We respectfully ask your committee to include two agricultural students in the plan. This matter concerns the national public interest, so we dare not remain silent. We hope you will investigate and implement it. To the best of our friendship, we address the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Reply from the Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Direct reply: We have received your letter requesting that two agricultural students be added to this committee's case of sending students to study in the UK. Mr. [Mu Ouchu]'s concern for academics and promotion of agriculture is admirable. Regarding the allocation of subjects for this committee's selection of students, it has been determined. Not having agricultural science is indeed a subject that our country currently needs. This committee has discussed this when allocating subjects. The United Kingdom is an industrial nation, so it was unanimously decided to postpone the selection of students for the agricultural subject. We will certainly report this to the next board meeting and refer to Mr. [Mu Ouchu]'s letter in the next selection of students next year. Thank you for your intention. We hereby reply and hope you will inform your colleagues listed. We apologize for not replying to each of them individually. Best regards to Mr. Mu Xiangyue, Management Office of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Dispute Arises in Workers' Children's Free School <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>British American Tobacco Factory in Pudong Undermines Labor Education</p>
<p>The workers' children's free school established by the Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union previously signed an agreement with the factory on April 1, 1929, stating that the factory would subsidize the union 750 yuan per month as operating expenses and stipulating that the factory had the right to send representatives to inspect the teaching. Over the years, everything has been fine. Unexpectedly, on June 23, the factory suddenly sent a letter to the union, claiming that the school was not well-managed and requesting termination of the contract. The union immediately submitted a report to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to negotiate on reasonable grounds. During the mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau, the factory proposed the following conditions: (1) The school board must consist of five representatives from the capital, five representatives from the labor, and five representatives from the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Education Bureau. (2) The monthly subsidy must be collected directly from the factory by the principal. The union stated that it did not object to the factory's proposed improvements, but the factory should not interfere with its sovereignty. The Education Bureau and the party and government organs should be in a supervisory position, and the union should handle the appointment of school board members, with the factory having no right to interfere. As a result, the mediation was unsuccessful. Yesterday morning, the union sent all members of the board of directors and supervisors to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. The Municipal Party Department sent Zhang Sheng and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Wang Xian Qing to receive them. The union representatives presented a petition and denounced the factory's attempt to undermine the treaty under the guise of improvement, which was a major issue concerning the education of 8,000 workers' children. They requested that the original contract be maintained. The result was very satisfactory. The union, because the factory violated the terms and undermined labor education, had already scheduled an emergency representative meeting to discuss countermeasures. It was also heard that the school board held an emergency meeting last night, as the start of the school year was approaching. It was decided to maintain the school independently and appoint Shen Yu as the principal. Classes are scheduled to begin on the 28th of this month. Today, a notice has been issued to start enrolling new students.</p>

<p>Depart Today on the Jiangjing Steamer to Jiangxi to Practice Various Outdoor Activities</p>
<p>The East Asia Physical Education College in Lujiawan, Shanghai, recognizing the lack of Boy Scout instructors in China, established a Boy Scout Instructor Training Class, invited domestic Boy Scout experts to serve as professors, and has achieved considerable success since its establishment. This year's summer training class has a very large number of students. The training methods are divided into three types: indoor, outdoor, and teaching practice. It is heard that the indoor theory courses have been intensively trained within three weeks, without regard to the day of the week, and have been completed. Therefore, it has been decided that the national regiment leader Qu Yue, coaches Sun Yixin, Gong Jingyuan, and Jin Shaowen will lead the students on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangjing Steamer to Lushan, Jiangxi, today for a summer camp to practice outdoor life. There will also be a 24-hour travel and reconnaissance, tracking, map-making, surveying, campfire, field warfare, and various course competitions. The camp will be dismantled on the 13th and returned to Shanghai for a graduation examination. The Boy Scout General Association will send personnel to invigilate the examination. Diplomas will also be issued by the central government. All students are energetic and studying hard. It is expected that the results will be very good.</p>

<p>南商籃球隊征菲續報</p>
<p>Continued Report on the Nanyang Commercial School Basketball Team's Philippine Expedition</p>
<p>第三戰敗於遠東書院</p>
<p>Third Game Lost to Far Eastern College</p>
<p>上海南洋商業學校籃球隊、遠征菲島、前二塲勝利、早登本報、（二十一日晚）與馬里刺遠東書院籃球隊作戰、首二節、亦佔勝局、至下半塲忽大雨淋漓、南商選手、以不慣雨戰、遂致敗衂、結果爲三十五比三十、</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nanyang Commercial School basketball team, on an expedition to the Philippines, had its previous two victories reported in this newspaper. (On the evening of the 21st) They played against the Far Eastern College basketball team of Malate. In the first two quarters, they also had the lead. In the second half, it suddenly rained heavily, and the Nanyang Commercial School players, unaccustomed to playing in the rain, were defeated. The result was 35 to 30.</p>
<p>第四塲戰勝岷里刺北中</p>
<p>Fourth Game Won Against Binondo North High School</p>
<p>南商因不慣雨戰之故、致爲遠東書院所敗、大起觀衆之婉惜、（二十二日晚）與馬里刺北中學戰、以五十五對二十三、大敗敵軍、雪其前晚小挫之恥、亦可爲揚眉吐氣矣、</p>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial School's defeat by Far Eastern College due to being unaccustomed to playing in the rain caused great regret among the audience. (On the evening of the 22nd) They fought against Malate North High School and defeated the enemy by a large margin of 55 to 23, washing away the shame of their previous night's small setback. This can be considered a moment of pride.</p>

<p>春秋酸葡萄哲學  林濚</p>
<p>The Sour Grapes Philosophy of the Spring and Autumn Period Lin Ying</p>
<p>從前有一隻還算聰明的狐狸，這一天，看見一架熟透了的葡萄，得垂涏三尺；可惜架子太高，百計不能到手；向着葡萄望了半天，只得無精打彩的走了開去，自已欲安慰着自已道：「那葡萄一定還酸得很呢！」</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a fairly clever fox. One day, it saw a vine of ripe grapes, making its mouth water. Unfortunately, the vine was too high, and it tried every possible way but could not reach them. After staring at the grapes for a long time, it had to walk away listlessly, comforting itself, saying, "Those grapes must still be very sour!"</p>
<p>這叚新聞流傳到人間，有些人便學會了一種聊以自慰或解嘲的方法。例如某甲單戀久久，毫無結果，只得罷手；罷手自然不甘，便會竭力從那夢寐不忘的女人身上導出某些缺點。又如舉子落第，便假設榜上題名也許會發生某種不幸；財迷望見黄金而無以得之，便也會照幾聲銅臭。</p>
<p>When this story spread among people, some learned a way to comfort or make fun of themselves. For example, if someone, let's call him A, had a long unrequited love with no results and had to give up, naturally he would be unwilling to do so, and would try his best to find some flaws in the woman he could not forget. Or, if a scholar failed in the imperial examination, he would assume that some misfortune might occur if his name were on the list; if a money-grubber saw gold but could not obtain it, he would also imagine the smell of copper coins.</p>
<p>這種方法，久而久之，便形成了一種頗有權威的生活哲學，或處世哲學。這哲學可以名爲自解哲學；如果要追溯到那來歷，便可以呌做「酸葡萄哲學」這名字就活潑得多了。</p>
<p>Over time, this method has formed a rather authoritative philosophy of life, or a philosophy of dealing with the world. This philosophy can be called the "philosophy of self-explanation"; if we want to trace its origin, we can call it the "sour grapes philosophy," which is a much more vivid name.</p>
<p>今日之酸葡萄哲學，好像在古老的中國特别發達。原來悠遠的封建社會之聖賢一向便以「忍」敎人，而造成了中國人之普遍的善於自安。到了今日，例如東四省淪亡之後，許多人還要搖頭搖尾道：「這正是中國人的好敎訓呢！」講這話的人自然不主張快快抗爭，而主張十年生聚之類，另外一些人聽了此話也便不暇思索的做那十年生聚之類的偉業去了。酸葡萄哲學發展到這般地步可謂猗歟盛哉。</p>
<p>Today's sour grapes philosophy seems to be particularly developed in ancient China. Originally, the sages of the distant feudal society always taught people to "endure," which created the Chinese people's general ability to be content. Today, for example, after the loss of the four northeastern provinces, many people still shake their heads and wag their tails, saying, "This is a good lesson for the Chinese people!" People who say this naturally do not advocate quick resistance, but advocate things like ten years of regeneration. Others who hear this do not bother to think and go do great things like ten years of regeneration. The development of sour grapes philosophy to this point can be called magnificent.</p>
<p>這般說來，酸葡萄哲學是弱者自慰哲學，是貪求者的解嘲哲學，同時是狡者的愚民哲學；統而名之，則爲自欺欺人哲學。</p>
<p>In this way, the sour grapes philosophy is the philosophy of self-consolation for the weak, the philosophy of self-deprecation for the greedy, and at the same time, the philosophy of fooling the people for the cunning; collectively, it is the philosophy of deceiving oneself and others.</p>
<p>說到弱者之以酸葡萄哲學聊以自慰，絶不能如唯心論者般解釋爲心理缺陷，而正是社會有以造成之。因爲社會太不平等，所以許多人處處受壓迫，不能有正當的自我發展，而終於只得拿酸葡萄哲學自解了，這裏，這葡萄而且舊了。可是我們相信世界終究會好。的那時無論是自欺或欺人的哲學都會消滅。</p>
<p>When it comes to the weak using the sour grapes philosophy to console themselves, it must not be explained as a psychological defect as idealists do, but rather as something caused by society. Because society is too unequal, many people are oppressed everywhere and cannot have proper self-development, and finally have to use the sour grapes philosophy to explain themselves. Here, these grapes are also old. But we believe that the world will eventually be better. At that time, whether it is self-deception or deceptive philosophy, it will disappear.</p>

<p>Chapter Twelve: The Poor and Humble Suffer in the Military, the Sick and Weak Lag Behind; Sacrificing Themselves Gladly to Disarm, Soldiers are Sentimental</p>
<p>盛世民又說，在軍營裏當軍官，至少當了營長以上的官，上了陣線，不會安全些。若說連排長，那是和弟兄們一様的受罪。排長是不必說，打起仗來，他带着一排人，先上前。連長也是緊緊的跟着三排人。打起仗來，有正正的全旅全團不回來的，連長那兒安全得了？</p>
<p>Sheng Shimin also said that being an officer in the military camp, at least a battalion commander or higher, would not be safer on the front lines. As for company and platoon leaders, they suffer the same as the brothers. Platoon leaders don't need to be said, when fighting, they lead a platoon of people to go forward first. The company commander also closely follows the three platoons. When fighting, there are entire brigades and regiments that don't come back, how can the company commander be safe?</p>
<p>江氏道：不打仗，没有功勞，那裏升得了官？盛世民道：勸人去當兵的，總是說可以升官發財。其實幾萬人裏頭，才挑出一個師旅長來，除了自已要有那能耐外，還要命運高，上個十次二十次火線，才有升大官的希望。别說上了火線，那槍砲子彈打得天上是火，地下是煙，在火線上有個三天四天的話，耳朶都會震聾。兩三天不吃飯，兩三天不喝水，那是極平常的事。我也想破了，不幹也罷。我們八塊錢餉，折成六塊四毛錢，還要四五十天發一回，扣了火食，能買雙襪子，捎一封家信，就算不錯。所以當大兵的人，七八年不回去，那是常事。你呌他拿什麽臉子回去？</p>
<p>Jiang said: If you don't fight, you don't have merit, how can you get promoted? Sheng Shimin said: Those who persuade people to join the army always say that they can get promoted and make a fortune. In reality, only one division or brigade commander is selected from tens of thousands of people. In addition to having the ability, you also need to have good fortune. You need to go to the front lines ten or twenty times to have hope of getting a high rank. Not to mention going to the front lines, the guns and bullets are fired so hard that the sky is fire and the ground is smoke. If you are on the front lines for three or four days, your ears will be deafened. It is very common to not eat for two or three days, and not to drink water for two or three days. I've thought it through, I might as well not do it. Our eight yuan salary is discounted to six yuan and forty cents, and it is paid every forty or fifty days. After deducting food expenses, it's good enough to buy a pair of socks and send a letter home. So it is common for soldiers not to go back for seven or eight years. How can you ask him to go back with any face?</p>
<p>這些話說得江氏默然無言。這天晚上，江氏一人睡在坑上，仔細想了一想，聽說連長是六十塊錢薪水，二十塊錢辦公費。若是打個八折，只好六十四塊錢，又要拿錢出來辦公，又要扣火食，還是四五十天一回，一個月也就不過三十來塊錢罷了。自已的姑娘，無論是說性格兒，模様兒，和他的能耐，那一様不是百裏挑一挑出來的。憑着這様的人不難道要挑一個掙二三十塊錢的姑爺，還找不出來嗎？你看，趕上定親，兩家都答應了，這是多要緊的時候。可是這位趙連長，倒在這個日子，遇上了總司令檢閱軍隊，抽不開身來。（一四六）</p>
<p>These words made Jiang silent. That night, Jiang slept on the kang alone, thinking carefully, and heard that the company commander's salary was sixty yuan, and twenty yuan for office expenses. If it is discounted by 20%, it would only be sixty-four yuan. He also has to take money out for office work, and deduct food expenses, and it is still every forty or fifty days, so it is only about thirty yuan a month. My daughter, whether it's her character, her looks, or her ability, isn't everything one in a hundred? With such a person, is it not difficult to find a son-in-law who earns twenty or thirty yuan? Look, it's time to get engaged, and both families have agreed. This is a very important time. But this Company Commander Zhao happened to meet the commander-in-chief inspecting the troops on this day and couldn't get away. (146)</p>
<p>普陀的梵音洞  衛術</p>
<p>The Sound of Brahma Cave in Putuo Wei Shu</p>
<p>乘着　曲折的後山之山腰，足邊茸茸地長着野草之叢，來到梵音洞，是午前十一時。</p>
<p>Arriving at the Sound of Brahma Cave at 11 AM, riding along the winding mountainside of the back mountain, with clusters of weeds growing lushly at the edge of the foot.</p>
<p>梵音洞之出名，奇妙傳說比之崢嶸的山色，是更其重要的，在那裏，有着會告訴人來生變作什麽的地方。</p>
<p>The fame of the Sound of Brahma Cave, the wonderful legends, is more important than the towering mountain scenery. In there, is a place that can tell people what they will become in their next life.</p>
<p>洞在山麓洞底蓋有一座廟，進得山門，要越過百十砐下行的石級。途中樹一禁止捨身投淵的木牌，立在那裏望峻峻的山巖下面，確乎是　惴然的。旣讓人曉得來生，又勸人不可妄求，又是什麽意思呢。</p>
<p>There is a temple at the foot of the mountain at the bottom of the cave. To enter the mountain gate, you have to cross a hundred or so steps of downward stone steps. Along the way, there is a wooden sign prohibiting people from giving up their bodies and throwing themselves into the abyss. Standing there and looking down at the steep cliffs below is indeed frightening. What is the meaning of both letting people know their next life and advising them not to seek it rashly?</p>
<p>越往下走，心就越是陰沉沉的，滿身一個洞，也像别的洞那麽凉快，黝暗，並没有什麽不相似的地方。</p>
<p>The further down you go, the more gloomy your heart becomes. The whole body is in a cave, as cool and dark as other caves, and there is nothing dissimilar about it</p>

<p>Mr. Liu Shenzhan</p>
<h3 id="e219">Suggests Postponing the National Games <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>To Save Economical resources and Time</p>
<p>Should Be Postponed to Mid-April Next Year</p>
<p>Also Serves as the National Preliminary Round for the Far Eastern Games</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Shenzhan issued an express telegraph yesterday, suggesting that this year's Tenth National Games be postponed to April next year. The reason is that since the Games and Conference were held this year, and the Far Eastern Games will be held in the Philippines in mid-June next year, China will inevitably hold another preliminary round. To save huge expenses and the precious time of young people, it is indeed necessary to postpone the Games to be combined with next year's national preliminary round, he said. His words are reasonable, and the original text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>The Tenth Far Eastern Games are scheduled to be held in Manila, Philippines, from June 9th to 17th next year (1934), and the Philippines has telegraphed to China and Japan to participate. Therefore, in April or May next year, China must hold a preliminary round to participate in the Far Eastern Games and select athletes, without any doubt. Since a preliminary round must be held in April or May next year, and another meeting will be held in October this year, holding meetings is never too much, but how can we not consider the national economy and the precious time of athletes? Moreover, the National Sports Conference last year resolved that the National Games should be held once every two years and be connected with international sports events. This is what promoters of sports should pay attention to. China's transportation is inconvenient, and its economy is declining. Holding a National Games is not an easy task, especially compared to Europe and the United States holding the World Games. According to estimates, each time a National Games is held, the expenses of the central government and various provinces and cities will be no less than several millions of yuan. Holding National Games every year and building a magnificent central sports field at Linggu Temple, which is far from the city, are equally uneconomical. To save national funds and the precious time of young people, this year's meeting should be postponed to April or May next year, which can achieve multiple benefits.</p>
