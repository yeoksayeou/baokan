<p>時評</p>
<h3>德意志反動政權之前瞻乃</h3>
<p>自墨索里尼挾所謂［汎繫主義］崛起於義大利。十數年來。横行國内。雄視歐陸。繼之而起者。乃有今日德意志之希特勒。所謂汎繫主義者。在學名即所謂國家社會主義。希特勒之國家社會黨。即以此而命名。此種主義。在學理上爲非驢非馬之一種怪物。在事實上則爲新舊時代交替中一種畸形的制度。此種畸形的制度。在歐陸特殊的地理關係之下。而有其一時偶爾之必需。故不問其在理論上之爲非驢非馬。仍不能不在冗長的人類史中。作曇花之一現耳。</p>
<p>何以言之。歐洲大陸。種族紛歧。大小國家。犬牙相錯。歷史上種族鬥爭。至爲殷繁。因强隣耽耽虎視。而民族之圑結自救。遂爲生存所必需。因之國家主義之發展。甲於全球。十餘年來。社會主義。因蘇俄革命之告成。由理論而實行。勞工運動素稱發達之歐陸。爲之震驚。躍躍欲試。現代之國家主義。旣以資本主義爲其靈魂。則社會主義之成就。自將成爲國家主義之致命傷。於是此徘徊歧途中之歐洲人士。欲拒抗時代潮流。屏社會主義於大門之外。旣爲勢所不能。而放棄國家主義。撤廢藩籬。又一時爲民族生存及歷史觀念所不許。遂不得不調和兩端。迎合各方。而以國家社會主義爲號召。主義之本身。旣矛盾若此。其終於無以自全。已早可槪見。而按之實際。固仍爲在國家主義之下。行欺人的社會政策。使資本主義。得以苟延殘喘。則謂爲資本主義日暮途窮中之最後掙扎。殆亦非虚語也。</p>
<p>義大利十數年來反動政權之治績。又如何乎。生産過剩也。失業也。恐慌也。舉所有資本主義下經濟制度之矛盾現象。義大利幾無一而不畢具。生産力澎漲之結果。開拓殖民地之要求。遂甚囂塵上。資本主義之演進而爲帝國主義。經汎繫主義之逼促。而加速成熟。義大利將爲破壞歐洲和平之主要動力。已屬有口皆碑。凡諸種切。均足證明義大利之汎繫主義。無疑的爲舊時代之殘餘勢力。而决非新時代之雛形。適與蘇俄南轅而北轍也。</p>
<p>由義大利反動政權之前例。也不難窺見德意志之前途。然墨索里尼者。猶辛遭遇時會。故能支撑以至今日。蓋義大利反動政權開始之日。適值戰後生産力凋蔽之時。在週期率上。爲由衰落以至繁榮之一階段。凡所設施。遂能推行盡利。而戰後之義大利。一面挾戰勝國之餘威。以臨德奥。北顧法蘭西。實力損失過大。亦非其敵。遂能睥睨歐陸。以充分滿足其黨徒種族觀念虚驕之要求。内部之圑結。遂得賴以不墜。若希特勒者。則受命之日。適值恐慌之高潮。將欲導人民於生産乎。則過剩之象且日劇。將欲導黨徒於破壞乎。則又與其所揭之主義相違。欲滿足人民壓迫後伸張民族威力之要求。則軍力雄厚之法蘭西。可以隨時制其死命。危哉希特勒。倘食其前言。轉趨緘默。則其結果。將爲路易喬治麥唐諾之第二。倘欲奮起以求一逞。亦不過作義大利攻法之前驅、蒙破壞歐陸和平之惡名。而取得前番大戰時奥匈之附庸地位。然爲希特勒計。殆又無能善於此二者。嗚呼。德意志之反動政權。</p>

<h3>美國聯邦儲備銀行開市</h3>
<p>殷實銀行亦可復</p>
<p>人民信任心已回復</p>
<p>國民十日華盛頓電美總統今日簽發行政命令、將所有管理銀行事務、統交財部辦理、財長伍定奉命後、立即聲稱、十二家聯邦儲備銀行、將於星期六重開、並將准其承貸用政府債務直接担保之借欵、儲備銀行重開後、儲備組織下之會員銀行、便可按照政府緊急規則、恢復全部業務、惟星期六照例僅營業半日、恐未必能有多數開市、料至下星期初、則全國各　可望悉有復業之銀行、且除禁止金貨及外匯交易外、其餘　業亦可不受限制、第會員銀行之欲復業者、須向財部請領聯邦政府營業執照、苟非確知其具有十足還債能力、則財部不發執照也、至救濟錢荒之新幣、將由聯邦儲備銀行於明日起發給各會員銀行、</p>
<p>國民十日紐約電紐約聯邦儲備銀行今日報告、人民對於銀行之信任心已大有回復之象、近四日來共有六千五百萬元重行儲入紐約各銀行、而其中三千萬元即於最近二十四小時内儲入、今日一天内此項金幣與金證劵之重存銀行者更絡繹不絶、金融家預料各銀行完全復業後、則將金貨回存銀行者當更踴躍云、</p>
<p>路透十日華盛頓電羅斯福總統今日簽一命令、命財長伍定對於聯邦儲備制之銀行會員、如查明果屬殷實、可給予復行開業之執照、惟金禁令仍嚴厲實行、州銀行之非此制會員者、須得管理州銀行當局之允准、始可復開、財長伍定宣稱、明日將有中央聯邦儲備銀行十二家復開門營業、國務卿赫爾聲稱、一俟内國銀行困難解决、美政府即將開始與各國作外交談話、定一告成世界經濟與金融會議之基礎云、</p>
<p>路透十日華盛頓電羅斯福總統昨獲勝利後、今再接再厲開始攻擊其經濟議案中退役軍士恩給金之付項、該議案已於今日在參院提出、案中請國會准許立即削減此費、若輩非完全喪失服務能力、而亦不盡可稽云、總統雖未説明詳細辦法、但據半官估計、每年可節省三○○·○○○·○○○元、羅總統又請國會准其削減政府公務員之俸金、至高以百分之十五爲限、综計每年可因此節省四五萬萬元、查一九三三年財政年度國用之短少、大約將超過一·二○○·○○○·○○○元、（金融善後社借出之欵不在内、）一九三四年之國用、若不即取行動、則短少之數將在一·○○○·○○○·○○○元左右、且在春季須償還政府短期公債數萬萬元、故改革益急不容緩云、</p>
<h3>英法會議成立諒解</h3>
<p>麥唐納抵日内瓦達拉提卽往</p>
<p>法德妥協仍爲軍縮成敗關鍵</p>
<p>國民十一日日内瓦電英首相麥唐納外相西門法外長彭古均於今日上午抵此、麥氏到後、即與意代表阿洛錫、軍縮會副主席波里蒂、主席漢德森、美代表吉伯生、先後接談、關防嚴密、未悉其内容云、　　哈瓦斯十日巴黎電英國麥唐納首相、西門外相、與法國達拉提總理、彭古外長、今晨十時二十分、開始商　　　問題、至午刻稍息、由達拉提設宴欵待、午後三時、繼續談話、至三時四十五分始畢、午前英法代表所討論者、特别注重日内瓦方面一切問題、午後會議、則專爲草擬正式公報、其文如下、［英國麥唐納首相、及西門外相、前往日内瓦、道出巴黎、昨晚下榻於英國駐法大使署、今晨得與達拉提總理、及彭古外長、把晤、極以爲幸、英法兩國代表、對於經濟政治上一切使人民注意之重要問題、互相交换意見、僉認日内瓦軍縮會議情形緊急、尤以歐州局勢爲甚、决以種種方法、與其他各國代表磋商、并成立妥協、以保全世界和平、］云云、麥唐納與西門離陸軍部後、直接返英大使署、定於今晚九時四十分、啓程、往日内瓦、首途之前、英法兩國要人、不再會晤、達拉提總理、原已决定展期赴日内瓦、但徇英國閣員之請、擬於下星期之初、啓程前往云、</p>
<h3>英法之意見</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯十日倫敦電英法兩國閣員在巴黎會商後所發表之公報、經此間政界人士、加以评論、謂［兩國閣員、决以種種方法、與他國代表磋商、并成立妥協、以保全世界和平］各語、當解釋爲麥唐納首相欲使法德兩國間、成立折衷方案、其基礎即係英國在日内瓦所提議［不訴諸强力一一層、而由此一基礎出發、則較爲完備之妥恊、亦可達到、似此一般人對於軍縮會議、認爲遇有阻礙者、自可賡續進行云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十日巴黎電英法兩國閣員談話之際、對於德國政治方針、及重整軍備之意志、已特别注意及之、英法兩國官塲人士、對于德國以鋼盔圑及國社黨衝鋒隊編警察一舉、認爲違反凡爾塞和約、至因軍縮問題、而重開歐美五强會議（即英德法意美）之議、似已暫予擱　、關于恊商各國間互債務問題之談判、將俟美國財政穏定之時、繼續進行、届時英法兩國將以談判情形、互相通告、據聞英法兩國政府、因欲維持和平、對于各種問題、其意均歸一致、</p>
<h3>德國之感想</h3>
<p>國民十一日柏林電法國半官新聞社發表關於法英談話之文告、顯係表示法國之見解、德國政界讀之已爲發生痛苦印象、文中稱德國决計重行武裝等言、尤屬荒謬、其所以出此者、殆欲破壞德國力謀平等待遇之企圖、文中又指德國以鋼盔圑與國社黨挺進隊編入警察隊實爲違反凡爾塞和約、要之此係纯屬誤解、蓋當此政局不靖之際、用作輔助警察、乃一時權宜之計、不能即以此指爲違反條約也、　　國民十一日柏林電此間法英人對於德意志不派重要閣員至日内瓦重開五强談話會一節、均公然表示失望、外間盛傳麥氏或將在瑞士邊界附近、意國境内、與意相墨索里尼一晤云、</p>
<h3>美國之注意</h3>
<p>路透十一日華盛頓電聞羅斯福總統昨夜與國務卿赫爾及去年出席軍縮會議美代表台維斯會商、所談者大都爲遠東與德國時局、美國官塲以爲世界軍縮之成敗、今漸届揭曉、德國恢復軍備之表示、及日本擴增軍力之氣象、皆使美國官塲爲之不安、又聞羅斯福政府抱有一種態度、如他國不减軍備而反增多之、則美國唯有效尤而已、</p>
<h3>意國之表示</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯十日羅馬電汎繫黨幹部會議昨晚開會、由首相墨索里尼主席、首相宣言、意大利政治之目標、在不擾亂世界和平、並援助歐洲政治經濟及精神上之改造、又謂軍縮會議如抛棄意大利之具體建議、則不能得到積極之結果、首相勸意大利全國黑衫黨努力于國家之强盛、並使汎繫主義普及世界云、</p>
<h3>日内瓦徵象</h3>
<p>路透社十日日内瓦電軍縮會前途之黑暗、及協定氣象之無望、從未有如今日之甚者、而英相麥唐納乃適將於此時蒞臨日内瓦、軍縮任何重要事件、輒見法德間意見之完全僵局、雙方皆無稍予讓步之表示、德國以爲德國旣已解除武裝、自不負責任、渠所要求者、無論軍備或軍縮、總須平等耳、法國則謂法國軍縮之程度、須爲法國所得安全之程度所支配云、雙方見解之牴觸、在在於大會中任何問題上見之、固不論其所討論者爲兵額·戰具·空軍或廢戰問題也、尤有使英相工作困難者、爲德法意三國負責大員之缺度、德國非俟獲有具體提案、不願遣副總理巴本或外長牛賴特出席、法總理達拉第亦不願冒在日内瓦爲英美意三國聯合包圍之危險、意國雖表示極同情之注意、但並未明白宣佈其贊助德國之决心、不過汎繫黨最高會議之最近决議、曾徵實意國此種立塲耳、同時波蘭與蘇俄間可注意的接近、現已顯著、此事現亦導成法俄間更密切之諒解、其所以有此變化者、則以德總理希特勒之反共行動有以促成之也、統觀上述種種情勢、英相麥唐納欲獲若何形式、或輔以軍備休戰之協定耳、顧即此辦法、德國亦必竭力反對之、是以前途至爲黯淡也、</p>
<h3>侵略之界説</h3>
<p>路透社十日日内瓦電軍縮會政治委員會今日午後集議俄國關於侵略國名詞界説之提議、俄代表杜夫迦勒夫斯基稱、唯完全軍縮始可爲安全之担保、但俄國之提議欲達此目的者、今旣未能得人贊助、渠乃以爲不可不定一嚴密方式、俾可自然决定孰爲侵略國云、中代表羅忠詒博士稱、渠意國聯盟約第十六條之適用問題、亦應研究、遠東現局尤證明此問題之重要、渠對俄國計劃、表示同意、渠深惜未有辦法以解决不宣而戰之難題、如果有此解决方法、則中國不致如今日之受害云、發言者數人贊成俄議、惟法國則予以有限制之同意、英代表艾登與美代表哲白生對於如此嚴格之侵略國界説能否實行、或是否有益、表示疑念、日代表矢田稱、侵略國名詞之界説、將常涉及必須顧念與爭議、有關各種難題之一種困難調查、渠主張宜謀取注重實際之一種公允方式云、政治委員會於一再討論後、指派起草委員會草擬條問、以備繼續討論云、</p>
<h3>日人目中之美海軍大演習之戰略意義（二續）</h3>
<p>（伊藤正德）</p>
<p>十三制空權的戰法</p>
<p>第一·美國獨有、與其説［獨不］母寗謂爲世界第一更爲恰當些、海空協同作戰的戰法、不論是攻擊或禦防、都圓滿地演試了、</p>
<p>在各樣的戰技上、對於列强略無遜色的日本海軍、所遺憾的即爲［海陸協同新戰術、不能不讓美國先登一步、美國新戰術思想對主力决戰時的制空便是决勝的條件、所以對百數十艘的舊驅逐艦毫不關心的任其停在岸傍、潛水艦大多數也一任其舊、僅巡洋艦最近將增至編隊數目、惟獨對於空軍的充實、比什麽都要積極、莫非德提案的常備一千架（五年計劃）一億七千萬元、竟如期完成、而於蘇拉突加及列新頓二母艦之外近又將完成一新艦［靈却］（一三、八○○頓、　七六機）並仍繼續積極擴充母艦、</p>
<p>在將來的海戰上、空中攻擊就好似陸軍的野砲戰、主砲砲戰也好似陸軍步兵的衝突了、换言之、陸軍步兵决戰的前提條件是陣地掃射戰、這正和海上空軍的活躍一樣、</p>
<p>一臨戰塲、美國海空軍取迅速的攻勢從空中將敵一掃而獲得其制空權、然後敵艦的飛機不能測騐砲彈的遠近位置、在相隔三萬碼以上遠距離戰、直如瞎子放槍、雖百發亦不會一中、反之美國飛機不但可以安然從事觀測、且可用轟炸機從空爆炸、宛如由水面射以魚雷般自由自在的作他們的優越戰、</p>
<p>譬如當甲乙二軍海戰時、甲軍無航空飛機、而僅乙有之、這樣戰爭的勝敗結果、當然可一目了然、</p>
<p>美國海軍即先致全力於空戰、務期將敵機完全掃蕩、則數小時後、必能和上述乙軍一樣的有把握、進行其絶對優越勢的戰鬭、現在常備的戰鬭機二三六、轟炸機三七八偵察機一四八（有輕炸力）、索敵機一三二、補用機（練習）一○六合計一千架、每種都精良優秀、而其運用技術亦不失世界第一流、</p>
<p>十四空軍之又一階段</p>
<p>在此之外、美國突於倫敦會議時提出［航空巡洋艦］的新條件、稍事紛爭之後、即經通過、此一條件不外乎對制空作戰補救飛機的不足而已、</p>
<p>以上是美國對空軍的另一方面計劃、現在就此次演習看去、布哇的攻軍及侵略美國本土的侵略軍、由航空母艦戰隊及大巡洋艦戰隊所聯成、其志在發揮航空戰的大量的威力、已如前所述、此隊的編成、寗可看做美國海軍所謂ＬargerＣarterGronp大母艦羣比較眞確些、而上述的所謂［航空巡洋艦］也就是使成爲ＬesaerCarrirGroup的意思、</p>
<p>美國之將此次演習的結果、歸納於航空母艦的充實問題上去、是毫無可疑的、新母艦靈却完工之後、合計九萬二千五百　二百八十架飛機、猶言不足、且努力宣傳、則以此次演習的經騐作標準、在華府條約［量］的限内、必更將積極的樹立建造母艦的方針了、藍雷艦（一二、七○○噸）自經廢棄之後、美國建造餘力由四萬二五百噸增至五五、二○○噸、一萬八千噸艦可造三艘飛機則須增備三百架、</p>
<p>如此海軍對一千架飛機丨艦隊用五一二架、陸上用及預備機四八八架、尚以爲不足、一九三六年海軍條約期滿時艦隊用機擴充至八百架左右、並在最近的將來整備航空巡洋艦時增加二百架、只艦隊用常備機即可達千架數目、此千架飛機、可在攻勢戰略下全部動員、以博得海上决戰的制空權、已不待言矣、</p>
<p>十五結論</p>
<p>但是日本海軍航空戰的準備怎樣呢、落後於空軍者亦必落後於海軍、海上的勇士無及於空、自不待言、</p>
<p>已經在滿洲及上海得着很多關於空軍經騐的軍部、在海陸軍八億二千萬元預算中、究竟有幾許投到空軍方面去呢、作者茲不欲加以追究、而只藉本文以促國人及當局之注意、如果空中被制、日本的潛水艦勢必爲敵之空軍如游戲般自由自在任其搜索任其爆炸了、現在在布哇演習攻守戰的航空母艦羣的最重要戰技、不就是對防守的潛水艦施以自由投彈、（因爲潛水艦均爲敵人者）嗎！</p>
<p>最後、在演習結論上其他的重要問題、就是對國民宣傳過的兵力充實問題了、</p>
<p>美國的議會、以不容易認可建造海軍而聞名、自然國民的推動力是强的、除一九一六年之三年計畫積極協助外、平常只説削減建艦費以保其傳流性、茲試將在倫敦條約、所規定之［量］内日美未造艦艇較比一下、</p>
<p>艦種　　美國　　日本</p>
<p>航空母艦四三、七○○一二、一三○</p>
<p>輕巡洋艦七三、○○○丨</p>
<p>驅逐艦一三一、○○○九、二○五</p>
<p>潛水艦二五、六三○丨</p>
<p>日本則充實而餘力至少、美國則有二七萬噸的餘力、</p>
<p>果然、美國海軍部在一月二十七日將充實案向上院海軍委員會提出了、如依此提案、至一九三六年各艦可造一三五艘、</p>
<p>三十二萬噸、計分、母艦三艘丨五五、二○○噸、巡洋艦九艘八七、一○○噸、驅逐艦八九艘丨一三三、五○○噸、潛水艦三四艘丨四○、七○○噸、</p>
<p>（註丨和前表不同者、因爲着手時的建造量和完成時的建造量不同、航空母艦的差異、是因爲大角海相將蘭、葛雷號計算在内、美國現廢棄此艦代以他種計畫、故恐由此處生出、）</p>
<p>一九三六年、是海軍條約期滿的一年、彼時常備兵量之戰略的必要及外交的必要、必將隨之緊張起來、其利害得失自然是另一問題、而［持以實力］的一種思想就是支配世界海軍的一個不可淹没的事、美國海軍大演習之最大目的亦即在於此、（完）</p>

<h3>人壽保險進展之趨向陳思度</h3>
<p>人壽保險胎息於古時歐洲北方之諾狄民族（ＮordicRaces）。其人篤守一夫一妻制度，故其保障家庭幸福之情感，與夫改善民族生活之慾望，油然而生。此種衝動，激　不已，結果人壽保險遂孕育而出。洎乎文藝復興運動前後數百年間，壽險之曙光閃鑠炳耀，曾於當時之工匠公所，友誼會社，及其他慈善圑體，露其端倪。此種組織，雖欠缺科學的原則與背景，實爲壽險事業之嗃矢。其後慘淡經營，漸具形相。迨距今一百七十年前，有槪然主義（Ｄoctrineofchancssorprobability）科學的發見，與利率交相爲用，可以估計人生價值矣。自西歷一七六零年以還，科學與人情結合，而保障家庭生活之善法，亦於是乎備。　　至根據科學方法而管理之壽險制度，則濫觴於一七六二年之倫敦公平保險社。此社開始發出普通壽險保單，所收保費以年齡爲標準，保費之多寡，以死亡之可能爲比例，故以［公平］名。至如異常危險，則擬收額外之保費，保費滿期，則予以三十日之寛限，保單失效，則准其於三個月内，證明康健，回復保單之效力，規制儼然，自昔已具。此外如保險計核部之設備，與專門計核準備債務制度之紹介，尤徵公司眼光之遠大，與其科學的發展壽險事業之熱誠也。　　雖然，當時各公司對於［公不］之科學的壽險發展，尚無踵行者。故壽險制度之進化，以至今日之法定準備金制度，其間殆有艱苦之經騐焉。當時壽險之所以未臻完美者，蓋由於數種謬誤見解，吾人今追論之，其或於中國壽險事業之發展，有所裨益，而於壽險進展初期，歐美人士所蹈之覆轍，庶可避免乎。　　昔人有以壽險爲可以永久應用徵收方法辦理而有成效者。所謂徵收保險者，即圑體中之一份子死時，要向生存之各份子，無論老幼，微收同一之費用，以爲賠償是也，此種保險之假定爲圑體中之年幼者將必年長，死亡之數將必與新進者之數相埓，如此新陳代謝，循環不已，全體之平均年齡，年年無改，而每人分擔之費用，亦大致相若。此實根本錯誤也，糜論新進之年幼份子是否足以補充老年之死亡人數，而謂年幼份子可與年長份子平衡相抵，則已謬甚。蓋死亡之危險隨吾人之年齡，而爲幾何數之增進，此點可以下圖之曲線表明之。</p>
<p>照此圖解則保費實與年齡同時增進也。查吾國之作此種謬誤之假定，以舉辦一年期圑體保險者，已數見不鮮，故特表而出之。徵收保險之制，即使建植於正確之基礎上，以年齡之多少爲收費之準繩，仍不適於實用，因老年時保費劇增，必致不能交納爲止，是何異於拒享高壽者於門外，而祇許不健全者繼續保險也。永久之保險制度，祇能應用科學的均等保費法行之。保户自始至終每年繳納同一之均平保費，以至保單滿期爲止，此種均平保費多於在初數年保險費用之所需者，其剩餘即　復利生息，日積月累，遂成一宗準備金，死亡賠償金之一部即取給於此，末後年間，所納保費，不敷賠償之所需，亦取償於此。故有以爲人壽保險公司類似其他經濟事業，所收保費之剩餘，除用以賠償捐失及支付經費而外，即可作爲　餘者，亦大　矣。在壽險公司發展之初期，頗有存此謬見者，故失敗者比比皆是。</p>
<p>吾人細察附列之保險費用與保單準備金圖表、當可了然於均平保費或同一保費之意義，與夫計核準備金在壽險之科學的運用上之重要矣。</p>

<p>於斯可見一年限期而可續保之保險法，保險費用逐年增加，與死亡之危險成正比例，自五十歳以上，增加尤速。照終身保費保險法，每年保費相同，付至受保人之終身爲止，但保險費用比一年限期保法，年年減低，由於保單準備金逐漸增加之故。照三十年滿期儲蓄保法，保險費用逐年漸減，而保單準備金則逐年漸增，至達到三十年滿期時之保險金額爲止。</p>
<p>保户有以爲所納保費，直投資耳，故於退保時，或滿期時，恒與公司爭執，謂應照複利計算，償還子母者，此實謬矣。又有於年事已高之時，投保壽險，而誤以爲公司於滿期時至少應償還全部保費者。唐詎知保險期内所得保障之費用乎，故認識壽險之眞正價值者，厥惟早死者之受益人而已。</p>
<p>人壽保險是一種科學。其成功必需計核專家之指導。美國某著名保險專家總括其工作而言曰；保險公司核計員之職責在監理公司之業務，以使其確立於穏固之經濟基礎上。保險事業之成敗全恃精密之計算，蓋公司即根據計核員所擬定之利率與人類死亡率及事業費（Ｌoading），以計算應收之保費也。計核員且按時估計各保單之準備債務，以斷定紅利分配之法，又製定保單内之估兌現金，借欵，及其他不可没收之價值表。當保單失效，退還，或修改之時，一切計算，皆彼爲之。除此種種專門日常工作外，凡有關於業務事宜，亦須其隨時供獻勸告於公司職員焉。</p>
<p>計核員工作重要旣如此，故爲計核員者須本其所學及職業上之專門科學以常自訓練，養成獨立思想，與判斷能力。俾主見堅定，不爲外界壓力所動摇，安穏進取，不受劇烈競爭所牽掣。於此余欲一述本人之經騐，當余在美國某壽險公司實習時，嘗奉命計算某圑體保單之保率。該單保障僱員二千人，附有殘廢保障進欵等利益。余製成之保費表意超過通常用者百分之六十，脱非上峯精明幹練立予嘉納者，則此表鮮不爲人揶揄誹笑矣。其後四年，即一九三○年，各公司因保單附有殘廢利益，致每年損失甚鉅，乃接受某省政府保險業監督之建議，羣謀補救之方策，於是一致開始增加此項保費。迄一九三二年，公司對於保單之附有此項額外利益者，限制綦嚴，改革益多，大槪已將保率平均增加约百分之六十五，大公司中對於新保之户，且有不再以殘廢利益爲號召者。然已承保之保單尚多附有殘廢利益，故每年壽險公司壽險部份之　利爲其所吸收者，猶不在於少數也。</p>
<p>總之，壽險保單爲長期契約，可以担保家庭生活之經濟保障，而關涉受保人之終生積蓄者也。故以穏妥合理方法經營保險事業者，應收取相當之保費，設立充分之準備金，俾公司能應付將來發生之賠償。各公司誠能在服務上與安全上，競爭努力，以促進壽險事業，豈不甚善，若徒以減收保費，以相傾軋，則失保險事業之本旨矣。我國壽險事業尚在幼稚時代。亟宜培養經理員之商業道德，促進公司間之共同協力，引起公衆之信任，宣揚壽險之福音，以確保其有穏固健全之發展。中華人壽保險協進社，今正負起此種使命，從事此項工作，吾望其能循斯正軌，赴此鵠的，我國壽險業前途，庶有　乎。</p>
<h3>人壽保險（二）郁賜</h3>
<p>作者於本刋第一期，發表近著人壽保險論文之首篇，述壽險制度之成爲社會組織之一部，其起源及進展大槪，茲請論壽險於負有給養家庭之責，或僅持薪給以應付經濟上之需要者，其爲最善之防護辦法，蓋無人能否認也。壽險制度之被採用中國最爲落後，遠不及他國之踴躍，其發　雖始於五十年前，華商經營之保壽公司，近年雖亦間有設立者，但合全國華洋保壽公司一年之保壽數目，恐猶無過於美國一個月，或日本六個月，保壽公司所添新營業數量之鉅也。</p>
<h3>不被採用之理由</h3>
<p>中國所以未能遍踪他國，確認壽險制度，在現代文化上，爲社會組織内之一部者，理由甚多，其極　而易見，母需於此詳述者，如辛亥年之革命，中國政治經濟，與夫社會之循序演進，無不遭受急劇之打擊，其一例也。然此外尚有需專門解釋者，請列舉如次：</p>
<p>從前洋商承保華人之壽險，僅限於資富保法一種，即合身後賠欵與滿期還欵二重利益於一者，取費頗昂，此蓋半由中國無死亡統計可資參考，保險行不願因貪微利而負重責，半由中國習俗以談及死亡之事爲不祥，而惡言保壽有以致之也。影響所及，觀感斯異，保壽僅爲個人生前投資之觀念，乃反甚於爲防身後親屬無依之原意矣。</p>
<h3>優厚之利率</h3>
<p>中國之利率極大，故推销資富保險，若不侈言期滿紅利之多，及將身故賠欵之代價，稍加穏瞞，則甚困難，待届滿期之時，所言紅利，往往難成事實。洋商不明華人保壽者，對於滿期時之所得，常存不滿足之心，而公衆不悉資富保險，含有上述二重性質，因生一種徧見，常以懷疑之眼光視之，甚有認保壽爲欺騙者。故著名壽險專門計算員美人林安君於其近著中曾曰［熱心保壽事業者，若不致力，以將保壽中之儲蓄與防危兩大項，分别表而出之，則其欲得投資界之重視，殆不可能。］</p>
<h3>徧見漸趨消滅</h3>
<p>可喜者，此種徧見，已得開設較早之某華商保壽公司，力爲糾正，廣事宣傳，説明保壽爲社會之重要事業，説明保壽，一爲儲蓄，二爲防危等要項，而日趨消滅，此保壽公司亦即首先以普通保壽法，貢獻於其國人者，壽險業年來大受公衆之歡迎，某公司之力實有足多。</p>
<p>中華人民之家族觀念極深，實爲别種民族所莫及，此亦中國壽險事業，未能儘量發展之一由也。如白克夫人近著［善的世界］中所云：［中國人民，即最苦階級中人，於貧苦無依之親屬，亦盡責濟施。］惟現代文明進化，貧苦無告者，以壽險事業之進展，已大形减少，而中華人民已漸次明瞭保壽之功，足以解除此種家屬負擔之束縛，費用不多，得益無窮，實爲上策也。</p>
<h3>交通便利之影響</h3>
<p>再者，近年交通日益便利，各區過剩之人口，移居他處者日衆，家屬連鎖之關係，已不如前。且以生活程度日高，而生産能力未能隨之俱高，使負有親屬給養之責者，益感不勝負荷之困苦。今壽險能爲依賴於人者，作未雨稠繆之計，不使一旦有所不測，即須累及戚屬之苦，故乃益得公衆之信仰矣。今日時機已熟，經營壽險事業者，急應起而廣作教育上之宣傳，則其成功操劵可待，此篇之作，亦因有鑒於斯，欲盡一分之力，以助其成耳。</p>
<h3>攸長經騐之回憶</h3>
<p>作者置身壽險業，已越三十五載，經手之保險及賠欵，不下數百萬之鉅，於壽險業之裨益人羣，知之極稔。據作者所知，壽險賠欵成爲被保人身後遺産之大部份者，蓋爲極其普通之事。美國人民之身後遺産，估計十分之八，係屬壽險賠欵，是以經驗之所詔示。凡人之於保壽，其問題已不在能否保壽，而在能否不保。歐洲大戰所起之經濟恐慌，與今日世界經濟衰落聲中，保險事業所獨有之長足進步。及近一二年來，各種證劵價值，無不跌落，惟獨壽險證單，保持原價，均足昭示保壽事業之眞價值也。茲有一事請舉以爲例。</p>
<h3>未保壽險之一農夫</h3>
<p>作者嘗至加拿大農區之某處旅邸小住，遇鄰村某農，來付農田押欵之本息，閒谈之中，言及其未保壽險，蓋以其妻迷信，竭力反對之，故繼邀予赴其家，并請開導其妻，解釋此迷信之不當，予從之，但無效果。嗣後，不久忽又邂逅某農談及前事，彼因莊田押有欵項及爲三個子女設想，奮然不顧其妻之反對，决保壽險七千元，囑以保單存放公司，蓋予其時，適爲該公司之經理，並囑勿告其妻，予即一一爲之照辦。至距二次保險費到期，僅數週前，某農因修理倉房石基，因工作不穏，倉房塌倒，竟爲壓斃。予在報端見此消息後，即持七千元支票賠欵，趕赴其家，至則其妻正痛夫之暴卒，復念嗣後生活之難，孤寡四口，何以爲活，鳴咽告余曰，設其早從忠告，許爲其夫保壽，則不至有今日之慘痛，予乃告以前事之經過，即將賠欵付給，至是伊乃恍悟其夫之明見，實爲伊所莫及，此事於予之印象最深，其解除生活痛苦之效亦最顯速。故仍長留腦海，今用以説明保壽之益，實非其他辦法所可及其切要也。</p>
<p>今日華商保壽公司，亦羣起作正當之宣傳矣。將來此種有益社會之組織，必廣爲採用，日趨發達，一改舊觀，此則作者敢預言者也。</p>

<h3>承德失陷實况</h3>
<p>湯玉麟竟不戰而退</p>
<p>義軍驍勇指揮無人</p>
<p>孫殿英决心抗暴日</p>
<p>僞軍不忘情於主國</p>
<p>新聲社云（上海市地方協會發表）電影界張慧冲、在上海東北難民救濟會席上、談述熱河實况云、主席諸位先生、今日鄙人得參加貴會、報告在熱目擊情形、及熱河如何失守之原因、以供貴會進行救國工作之參考、至爲欣慰、鄙人在去年十一月中旬、由福建十九路軍軍次來滬、携有蔣綏靖主任及蔡將軍等介紹函、預備往東北攝取國軍及義軍抗日實事影片、以盡國民協助政府宣傳之天職、到滬後、即請任矜蘋、任錫藩、二君合作計劃、组織前敵攝影隊、并與貴會許克誠先生會晤蒙許先生加以勸勉、親書介紹函、分謁京方北平各主事人員、當於本年一月三十一日、與任錫藩君由滬起程、於二月三日抵平、十三日由後援會運輸處趙主任、派六號專車車送入熱、開始工作、凡在前敵指揮各將領、與義軍領袖及隊伍、皆甚歡迎攝入片中、宋院長、張學良及貴會入熱各代表、亦皆相遇、在攝片時、并與談話間探詢各方情形、茲將耳聞目擊事實、擇要報告如下</p>
<p>承德失守上海各報所載戰訊、承德於三日失守、其實承德於二日午夜已放棄、放棄時并無攻入之日軍、報載侵入承德之百餘日軍、據鄙人臆斷、并非由正面馳入、或係預匿於附近之某地、待湯走後出現、因鄙人於二日晚間七時、見馮庸率四人自前方回、據云、日軍已至凌源、其時張作相已不在、吾人聞訊出走、熱湯如車運物之工作、已成爲目擊之事實、證以日軍從未派飛機至承德轟炸、及二月二十四日停止供給義軍汽油過去之事實、（後援會共有車十七輛、可由平输運至承德、因車輪關係、由承德運往前線、須由湯之交通隊汽車運載、自任命張作相爲總指揮之消息發表後、撥車即有所留難、至二月二十四日、熱湯并停止供給義軍汽油、）及日人虚張聲勢、追擊熱湯、掩飾宣傳、可知承德實爲妥協之放棄、至於作戰情形、亦與事實不符、因前方除孫殿英軍外、未必有何激戰、僅於三月三日下午四時、回平歸途中、見有張作相軍约兩圑、在離古北口二十里地方、向古北口整隊後退、而張作相在承德所發之第一命令、即令將子彈退回古北口、</p>
<p>義軍不戰在熱各義軍、對於朱子橋將軍極信仰、且大都對於日軍甚輕視、當敝人晤老北風時、彼與彼之左右、皆曰、吾人最大之需要爲食糧與衣服、至於子彈尚可向敵人搶取、并無畏懼日軍意思、據彼自述、某次彼曾率領弟兄衝過日軍所守之鐵路線、向朱將軍指定地點、領取槍彈、其他各義軍之表示、亦皆相同、惟人民因生活極苦、對於義軍之就食不無怨言、自統一軍權、張作相接收義軍之消息發表後、張作相旣不親往撫慰、又不派人撫慰、又因熱湯停止供給汽油、而運輸中斷、義軍大都失望、甚有認替張作相立功爲無謂者、益以熱湯軍隊、相繼叛變、情形如此、何能獨　義軍不戰、據鄙人之見解、倘政府能正式任命朱將軍統率義軍後、方能確定辦法、予以完密之接濟、不獨已散之義軍、可以重集、且可擴大其範圍、蓋熱省大股土匪、絶對不刦後援會之輸運車、若小股土匪、有誤刦後援會運輸車者、祗須一言朱將軍、或朱老頭兒之名、（若言後援會朱慶瀾朱子橋則不知、）即停止搶刦、甚有將已搶之物送還者、大槪義軍皆極勇敢、認擾亂殺戮日軍爲興奮之事、惟缺組織與訓練、至於享名最盛之義軍領袖、其忠勇之精神、未能悉如吾人之意想耳、</p>
<p>湯部叛變湯部隊伍之叛變、各報已有紀載、以欠餉爲第一原因、以熱湯旣得中央軍費、給發價值滬洋三四角之廿五元熱鈔爲第二原因、其第三原因、則在當局者旣不撫慰亦不準備聯絡作戰之軍事組織、倘事前指揮者能得其人、已配置充分之隊伍、已有聯絡作戰之組織、而復予以激勵撫慰、則熱湯部隊、或不致叛變也</p>
<p>孫部英勇孫殿英軍、係由朱將軍催請入熱、計其步行路程近三千里、所有給養極薄、沿路祗能分圑前進、士兵皆極英勇、除步槍外、皆各有大刀一把、備肉搏殺敵之用、鄙人於二月十六日、在承德晤孫將軍、至二十三日、即隨孫軍開赴隆化、二十四日至克勒溝、二十六日至赤峰、至二十八日在赤峰之孫軍前鋒、已與由下窪進迫之敵人接觸、孫將軍於次日派車護送吾人回承德、孫將軍爲人極豪爽、具有堅决殺敵立功之决心、當鄙人初抵北平上海時、有人傳其叛變、鄙人即力言其不可信、並告最初晤面之報界諸友、自願以頭顱擔保孫必不變、今則事實已爲之證明矣、惟孫將軍給養極薄、彈藥亦頗缺乏、須盡力予以接濟、否則必極危險也、</p>
<p>僞軍情形僞國軍隊中、據鄙人所知、其間頗有與義軍聯絡者、因被日軍迫作前驅、常在作戰時、左右分開、使日軍與義軍直接接觸、有時或爲虚僞之追逐、至僻靜處、以子彈售與義軍、倘全國能一致抵抗、而復能建樹威信、則僞軍起而倒戈、亦爲可能之事、綜合鄙人耳聞目擊之事實、實熱河之失、並非戰敗、實爲放棄、且熱地山路狹險、即使不戰而以亂石堆塞路中、亦足牽掣敵軍之行程、若以火油汽油滿置路中、待敵人之至而燃燒之、則雖無電雷等準備、亦可爲應敵之用、今仍坐失天險、殊堪痛憤也、</p>

<p>正式商輪蘇聯商船隊、先有租用之挪威船六艘、行駛上海與海參崴間、係爲恢復中蘇海運之試行輪、今蘇聯商船隊、因中俄間貨物往來日多、前項租船、陸續解約、而確定派本隊之自由商輪五艘、正式行駛中俄航路、第一船洛蘇夫斯基號、在上月下旬抵滬、第二船伏爾柯威斯德羅號、亦由海參崴開來、純載大批木料、有十六萬尺、今日可以進口、停在江南船塢前起卸、大致十八號可以開崴、第三船約本月杪可到、以後每二十天有一蘇聯商輪進口、</p>
<p>運載茶磚我國茶磚、蘇聯有最大销路、自復交後、蘇俄定購尤夥、聞共有數萬噸、今悉從上海由海道運至海參崴、再轉俄國各地、此項茶磚出口、已由蘇聯隊取得專運　、在過去二十天内、已裝去七千噸、此次伏　柯威斯德羅號出口、尚有二千噸載去、</p>
<p>籌開正班昨據經理蘇聯隊輪某君面稱、中蘇貿易、逐漸發展、蘇聯來貨、過去的尚以木材煤油等居多、但俄國花標布、不久將有裝來、蘇聯商船隊、已决定在滬崴間、開永久的航路、但目前尚爲非正式的臨時船、故猶未有客票等之出售、中俄間正班定期郵船、據渠所知、至遲在兩個月内、定可開駛、蓋航行客輪、有待於蘇俄新領事之到滬、則届時簽證護照等、可免種種轉折麻煩、</p>
<p>租大批輪海參崴北部之堪察加、爲産生海貨木材、煤油等項區域、惟天氣奇冷、每年須封凍六個月、今則距解凍之期、不過三星期矣、自四月分起、蘇聯隊又須來滬、租用大批輪船二三十艘、至該處承運魚木油煤等、到海參崴、此項租船、多以六個月爲期、不久蘇聯隊即將與滬上華商船東、討論賃船問題、</p>

<p>事實緣被告劉崇武·潘鴻生·曹松壽·田水陽·與在逃之某某等於民國二十一年十一月十六·十八·兩日、在新閘路大王廟密謀兩次、於十八日携帶手槍炸彈、同往新閘路三百十號茂泰洋貨店、由劉崇武投擲炸彈曹松壽開槍、將該店經理王正濤擊斃、潘鴻生携槍帮兇、田水陽在門外把風、事後即各自逃逸、又於同年同月廿四日下午二時許、在天津路二六三號寄宿舍密謀、後由劉崇武及曹松壽各帶手槍、潘鴻生携帶炸彈、偕同在逃同黨數人、同往漢口路延康里三三九號裕源恒洋貨號、由劉崇武·曹松壽·開槍、當場將店夥王義榮擊斃、潘鴻生將所持之炸彈、擲向該號舖内、店夥吳照仙、致受重傷、又於同年十月二十四日下午四時許、又在上海市民會九區辦公室密謀、後由潘鴻生·曹松壽·携帶炸彈、往河南路一三三號孫廣興鐘表店、由潘鴻生在外把風、曹松壽將所帶炸彈、向店内夥友謝斌泰擲投、谢當受傷、又於同年十月二十五日下午六時許、由曹松壽·田水陽·携帶手溜彈及恐嚇信先後往新閘路四四九號茂泰新洋貨店·及新閘路四九四號投擲炸彈及恐嚇信、又於同年十一月二十八日上午九時半由劉崇武·潘鴻生·同往康腦脱路五六七號德源昶洋貨店投擲炸彈、又祝爾康·華志達·於同年七月間、致函東西華德路二○二號金有記皮貨店、用恐嚇詞句、警告勿賣日貨、後由工部局警務處偵探在該被告等家内搜獲同樣信函多件、</p>
<p>理由第一·二·三·四·被告、對於新閘路茂泰洋貨店開槍殺人一案所應負之責任、固屬明瞭、該被告等在捕房早經供認、即事主亦雖到庭證明、該被告等之白白、完全出於自動、潘鴻生當庭供認事前在大王廟同謀情形、曹松壽亦當庭供認開槍等事、至於被告所主張商議者、爲警告奸商開槍爲自衛等語、顯然爲一種狡賴之詞、不近情理、不足置信、而原判决所稱捕房不能證明王正濤即係本案各被告所擊斃者、實係錯誤、按刑法所規定共犯之要件、祗須有犯罪意思之聯絡及實施時之在塲、即應負同等責任、今被告等業已自白事前有二度之密謀、已可證明各該被告有共同犯罪之意思、而犯罪時又共同在塲、則其應負共犯責任、毫無疑義、是爲上訴人對於本案判决不服之理由一也、第一二三被告等同往漢口路三三九號開槍擊斃王義榮、傷害吳照仙一案、工部局亦已提出充分證據、以證明各該被告等所應負共同之責任、而原審僅認劉崇武一人爲有罪、此又係錯誤、關於孫廣興一案、曹松壽擲彈炸傷謝斌泰、已爲不爭之事實、而原審僅憑被告片面之供詞、認爲無殺人之故意、夫投擲炸彈、可以致命、三尺童子、猶能知之、而謂被告不知、其誰信之、旣明知炸彈可以死人、而猶悍然投擲、其有殺人之故意明甚、豈得因被告空言搪塞而將傷害罪之解釋、擴大至於如此地步、此上訴人所以不服原審之理由三也、關於其餘部份、原審認爲連續行爲而歸併在茂泰等案、亦屬錯誤、蓋連續之要件、須爲同一罪名、查此一部份僅屬妨害自由、而於以前諸案、如殺人及殺人未遂等案、全不相同、上訴人對於原審此點之認定、實不甘服、况原審判决、量刑太輕、非特有失科刑之目的、反有鼓勵犯罪者之嫌疑、殊失國家設立刑罰之本旨、爲此狀請鈞院鑒核、依法將判决撤銷、而將劉崇武以殺人罪妨害自由罪、併合嚴重處罪、潘鴻生以共同殺人及妨害自由二罪、併合從重處罪、曹松壽·田水陽·以共同殺人罪殺人未遂罪及防害自由罪併合三罪、從重處斷、並將祝爾康·華志達·以妨害自由罪加重論罪、實爲公便云云、而各被告中之劉崇武、則以原判處刑七年、實覺太重、亦延陳霆鋭·范剛·律師提起</p>
<p>上訴要求從寛末减、昨晨由高二分院刑庭推事周翰特開第二法庭、傳集人證、將劉等六名、提案審理、周推事當以各被上訴人除劉外、均無律師辯護、因即爲指定范剛律師兼爲義務辯護、俾享受法益、乃先向劉崇武訊問、據劉供、彼等組織圑體之目的、在警告私販仇貨之奸商、故先之以函勸、不聽則以爆裂物相贈、警告茂泰渠雖同往、但王正濤則不知被誰槍殺、推事旋訊以事前在大王廟密謀處死王正濤之事、劉答此非渠所知、至槍殺王義榮、則當時因王突將渠從後背扭住、渠方執槍在手、乃與掙扎、以致觸動槍機、於是走火、絶非有意等語、潘鴻生承認參加警告工作、計共四次、而否認開槍傷人、曹松壽亦承認四次、否認傷人、田水陽祗承認向茂泰等兩家警告、祝爾康·華志達·兩人均稱與劉等初不相識、從未參加劉等之任何工作、華並稱雖曾作就警告悦來南貨店等兩家之警告信、但實未寄出云云、周推事繼復向到案證人逐一質訊、時已届午、遂諭退庭、劉等分别還押、改期再訊、</p>

<h3>我的煩悶丨教育與婚姻</h3>
<p>丨南昌古尚言君來信丨</p>
<p>現社會如此這般，···讓潔心自好的青年困在裏面，怎能不常常感到煩悶？我的煩悶，怕也就是一般青年的同病吧！（一）求學的：我現在是省師的師範生。以清貧無能的我，得入師範，也不能不説是幸運！然而不幸的事跟着來了。我入學剛剛半年，程度上雖是不成問題，但是經濟上發生絶大恐慌。我家裏因爲連年遭匪，一家數口，衣食尚難維持，我的求學費用，當然没有辦法負担。幸而家兄經商某地，還可以勉强接濟。現在他店裏受時局影響，已經结束，家兄失業賦閑，平昔又無積蓄，因此我的經濟來源便斷絶了。敝校不但不能免膳費，并且還要按期繳納制服雜費。每學期連自己零用，至少要七八十元。兄畏接濟已停止，自己又不會賺錢，怎麽辦呢？没有錢的人，是不應該受教育的嗎？（二）婚姻的；婚姻是人生最大問題。如果和對方性情不投，那末一生的志願快樂，便從此頽喪斷送，這是一定的道理。我八歳時，父母卽爲我定婚。在未婚以前，我對她便有不滿意的心理。去年在父母嚴命之下成了婚，當時雖想反抗，不幸受　境的支配。新婚之後，竟發見她生理上有變態，而且在未婚前失貞。而且教她讀書十多天，還認不上十個字！···</p>
<p>其他的一切，不説可知了。結婚將近一年，同居還没有半個月，性情旣不投，感情無從發生，何况偕老百年？我屢想提出離婚，無奈，環境不容許我，暫時尚無辦法，毅然决然的奮門吧？但是離婚的手續怎麽辦？要如何應付環境，才不致失敗？脱離之後，續絃的問題，摩登小姐不願意要，相當的配偶，又一時難　，而且離婚结婚，費用不小，也是層層的障碍。這種婚姻，怎麽辦呢？顧問先生！請指示一條明白的方針，垂救那徬徨十字路口的我！</p>
<p>答；（一）關於求學方面的丨［没有錢的人］是應該一樣受教育的；然而這是理論，在現在社會裏，没有錢的人，事實上是無［權］求學的。不過我們要爲足下進一解。你千萬不要認爲進學校才是受教育。實在我們入了社會以後，無時無地不在受教育，無時無地不可以求學。學校的教育是刻板的教育，老實説，像我們這些人都是没有受到多少學校教育的，然而多少博士，學士，從我們的眼下走過，我們並不曾發見他們的什麽特别高明的地方。可見求學問並不一定到學校去求，倒不如我們自己在社會中一面做事，一面自修切平實用。窮人只有這個方法，然而也只有窮人才有這種幸運！足下幸勿河漢斯言。（二）關於婚姻的丨你旣不願意這種婚姻，就不該同她結婚；結了婚發見她的生理上的變態，你便斷定她的不貞。這話可就難説了，因爲變態兩字的範圍太不確定，我們不敢妄贊一詞。即使她以前果然不貞，也不能即以此爲與她决裂的理由。因爲在現在社會中，男女交際漸漸公開，此等事情，恐怕成了家常便飯。有些女子從前失過身吃過一些苦頭，倒反比其她女子好，假使她果然愛你的話。果眞你不願同她百年偕老，那只有早些脱離家庭，到外邊求學，一面寫個信給她，請她早些打算，各行其是。你暫且一邊找工作，一邊努力自修，不必急急地忙着什麽［續絃］咧！什麽［摩登小姐］咧！什麽［结婚］咧！一個年紀輕輕的人，爲什麽這樣急急忙忙地進行這件事，正好趁此機會專心致志地服務社會努力學問，日于還長着呢！没有自立生活的能力忙着去結婚，這種人不僅應該吃苦頭，而且一定會吃苦頭！</p>

<h3>中山文化教育館成立（文）</h3>
<p>中山文化教育館初由黨國要人林森蔡元培蔣中正孫科諸氏以及國内社會各界領袖三百餘人發起創设、繼復由中央政治會議决議月予補助五萬元、上海市政府亦年予補助五萬元、在優越之物質條件與全國各界熱烈贊助之下、籌備三閲月、今日已在南京正式舉行成立典禮、奠定此一規模宏偉之文化機關之基石、</p>
<p>該館之緣起中有曰、［革命之意義亦即在於推翻不適合某一時代經濟環境之舊文化、而創造其新文化、並樹立其新基］、又有曰、［自民十五以來新文化之基礎、初並未堅强樹立、···青年思想不得正確之領導、於是一般青年求出路而不得、遂徘徊於十字街頭、或竟步入歧途］、末且揭舉其工作方針、爲［閘明孫中山先生之主義與學説、以樹立文化之基礎、以培養民族之生命］、凡此所言、皆至爲扼要、在事實上、自國民黨底定全國、於茲六年、然而兵連禍結、長停於軍政時期之階段、初無餘力以及於文化、前數年雖亦曾派遣黨員留學、然而是徒爲一黨培植人材、甚且毫無計劃、尤無目的、其無所裨益於文化、自至爲顯然、然則今日中山文化教育館成立、以遠大之計劃、努力於新文化基礎之建立、母寧謂爲國民黨執政以來、一較有建設意義之創舉、</p>
<p>正以該館之成立、爲一較有意義之創舉之故、吾人對於該館之期望乃愈亦深切、而願於該館成立之伊始、一貢其愚見、</p>
<p>第一、該館所揭舉、努力目標、爲樹立文化之新基、文化之新基究如何而後始能樹立乎、吾人認爲其先决問題、厥爲正確把握時代之動向、與世界思想之潮流、中國爲世界之一環、中國之文化亦决不能脱離世界之洪爐、故吾人認爲新文化基礎之樹立、乃在於外審時代之動向、内審我國目前最迫切之要求、以最大之努力、推進我國文化入於一新階段、而且此一運動、應恰與當前之復古運動、處於對立之營　、</p>
<p>第二、所谓文化運動、應以大衆爲其對象、應發揚大衆文化、應以大衆之福利爲前提、换言之、即今日之所謂文化運動、旣不應爲粉飾太平之工具、尤不應爲阻滯時代前進之障礙、以大衆之要求爲出發點、以大衆之福利爲依歸、秉此而孜孜努力、夫然後可以謂爲［新文化運動］、</p>
<p>吾人所希望於中山文化教育館諸君子者如是、所忠告於中山文化教育館諸君子者亦如是、宏業肇創、願諸君子勉之、</p>

<h3>男子組第一次决賽中華克服美國</h3>
<p>中華先敗後勝結果四七比三六</p>
<p>各有特殊表演本季中從未得覩</p>
<h3>女子中華敗於英國二十二二十九</h3>
<p>美國勝聯邦四十四比三十六</p>
<p>操縱海上籃球　　之上海美僑籃球隊、昨晚在萬國籃球首次决賽中、被中華以四十七比三十六擊敗、擠滿一千五百餘餘觀衆之中華籃球房、充滿狂熱的人氣、門票雖售一元、却未足以减其盛况、而於此戰之過程中、個個觀衆、無不聲嘶力竭、狂呼呐喊、手掌擊痛、亦不之顧、中華健兒、則個個各展所長、努力奮門、始終不懈、表演之佳、堪嘆觀止、故能在美國隊威脅屈服之下、打出生路、得到最後勝利、是以中華健兒與中華觀衆、可稱相得益彰矣、惟中華女子不幸以二十二比二十九爲英國擊敗、錦標希望、自下當以英國隊最高、此外美國女子與聯邦之戰、美以四十四比三十七勝、</p>
<p>或曰、西青海賊籃球隊、連續操縱海上冠軍有年、加以麥令斯亦勁旅之一、該工隊人才之高大、球　之深遠、有口皆碑、今合併而取萬國錦標、殆無疑　、在平時之談論籃球者、以及昨晚籃球房中、在在可聽到以上之批評、甚而至於中華必敗無疑、其理由則根據於平時之觀察、以及萬國　賽之情形也、詎料昨晚之形勢、美隊固未稍减其鋒芒、而中華之奮發有爲、氣燄萬丈、確出乎意外、故觀者得此意外之欣悦、益覺喜色洋洋、雀躍三百矣、</p>
<p>若論競爭形勢、美國於前十五分鐘、處處留露其尖鋭化之藝術、前鋒雖在中華嚴密監視下、殊少活動、但兩後衛匹萊與白乃特、沿邊襲進、頻頻得分、中華依舊無辦法、祇得屈居人下、徐圖宏展、乃步步吃緊、不稍放鬆、卒能於上半時之終了時、突然以十九比十七超出美國、下半時中、美國繼續壓迫、中華不稍示弱、卒能一路佔先、使美隊難展所長、如隨五里霧中、而以四十七比三十六之大差、使中華得首次勝利之光榮、作奪回已失兩年霸權的一層基礎、</p>
<p>至於中華女子自被英國擊敗後、希望自少一籌、但下星期三英美之戰、美國如能擊敗英國、則中·美·英三隊成鼎足之勢、猶須作例外之决賽、以定錦標、如美敗、則錦標歸於英國矣、是故中華之一線生機、全繫於英美之一仗、至於昨晚中華之敗、實由於英隊防禦之周密、使中華無得球投籃之機會、軍師陸鍾恩目覩此狀、亦無可奈何耳、茲述昨晚三戰經過如下、</p>
<h3>美克聯邦（女结果四四比三六</h3>
<p>第一塲女子美國對聯邦、雙方均有良好表演、且形勢平均、競爭劇烈、益增興趣、第一節美隊僅以四分佔先、比數爲十二比八、第二節聯邦稍示軟弱、美國白乃特與鮑沙克二女士、殊爲活動、聯絡出色、投射準的、致以十五比六勝、總計上半時總比、美國二十七分、聯邦十四分、休息再戰、聯邦氣燄萬丈、瑪蒂二姊妹尤見驍勇、勃葛洛夫從中策應、工作緊張、較美隊後衛顧此失彼、故在此節中、美隊得不償失、唯有甘拜下風、比數爲十六比十、總比爲三十七比三十、最後一節開始、聯邦依然聲勢雄壯、比數曾追至三十六比三十七、僅以一分落後、以爲美國將轉勝爲敗、不料最後三分鐘、美隊重覩天日、連連投中、總結果成四十四比三十六、卒歸美隊勝利、裁判周家騏、</p>

<h3>中華慘敗（女）英國以二九比二二勝</h3>
<p>第一節打個平手</p>
<p>第二塲爲中華對英國之女子决賽、開始接觸、中華手氣頗順、潘月英得楊森之助、首開紀錄、未幾、楊亦中、以四比零勝、英國女將、包圍籃下、連連發射、但手勢不　、無一中的、回過頭來、楊森又中、中　乃得六分、英國極力　攻、潑林斯姊妹花、身體高大、佔得便利、海蒙特活潑勇敢、不易防禦、三人互中、成六六平手、</p>
<p>第二節英國小勝</p>
<p>是節開始、楊森籃下不中、觸一　頭、接連又擲二球、又未中的、歎息之聲未絶、英國復連增四分、乃超出中華（十比六、）潘小姐大發雌威、還中一只、Ｖ潑林斯罰中一分、楊森再加一球、分庭抗禮中、中華先頭未得、卒以十二比十三、被英國勝前一分、成上半時之總比、</p>
<p>第三節每况愈下</p>
<p>休息再戰、英國氣燄益盛、聲勢愈大、連中三元、使中華挽回無　、畿番努力、僅由陳榮明罰中一分、楊森投中一球、而英隊又中三球、比數成二十五比十五、中華以十分落後、觀乎此、中華後方頗露慌張、卽如王志新黃淑華素稱穏健、至此竟亦不能鎭靜、前鋒球難到手、對方步步爲營、嚴守不懈、使中華無活動機會、</p>
<p>第四節得不償失</p>
<p>最後一節、中華背城借一、大興聞鼎之師、果然球勢稍轉、潘月英首中、陳榮明罰得一分、繼之、潘月英又中、連得五分、氣象一新、四座歡聲乃如死灰復燃、重行熱烈起來、但終究得不償失、徒唤奈何、最後結果、英國二十九分、中華二十二分、裁判員透仁、</p>

<p>漸見鋒芒</p>
<p>此一時期過後、中華威武漸　、吳國霖中的後、史密斯卽還一球、孔廣益再加一球、齊爾又還一只、在此堅持不讓之形勢下、中華健兒忽如餓虎撲食、由吳國霖陸鍾恩孔廣益撲取五分、僅以一分（十三比十四）落美國之後、劇戰與呐喊聲中、錢敬鏞角球妙中、中華遂突然以十五比十四、駕乎美國之上、</p>
<p>翻雲覆雨</p>
<p>爲時無幾、匹萊罰球成平手、白乃特復向邊陲溜　、　中一球、中華忽又以二分落後、斯時中華鋭氣正盛、不稍氣　、孔廣益運球向籃下投　、一舉中的、同時史密斯因防守犯規、加罰一球、孔又中的、中華遂連取三分、天日重覩、錢敬鏞亦罰中一分、上半時卽行告終、檢點比數、中華以十九比十七佔先、</p>
<p>氣燄萬丈</p>
<p>再戰聲起、屈拉　罰球先得分、中華方面、由錢敬鏞馮念華連射中的、以二十三比十八居前、於是歡呼益盛、聲震遐邇、競爭益見劇烈、局勢愈覺興奮、美國力圖掙扎、齊爾兩射中的、陸鍾恩孔廣益從此監察益嚴、兵對兵、將對將、各盡職使、各無偷暇、故愈戰愈見緊張、中華力破銅網、個個爭先、各建奇功、忽以三十五比二十七勝前、氣燄不可一世、</p>
<p>美軍不支</p>
<p>美軍受此挫折、顯見不支、乃暫停戰事、重振軍容、冀圖報後、果然白乃特卽中一球、但中華豈肯稍讓、馮念華爭得罰球一分、齊爾中的後、似見起色、無如吳國霖馮念華又中二球、增加四分、美國反以九分落後、三十一比四十愈見不支、斯時尚餘四分鐘、美國或猶可追趕上、奈以中華鋭氣方剛、無可如何、</p>
<p>調兵遣將</p>
<p>美隊至此大調人馬、除白乃特外、悉行調替、冀用以逸待勞之計、而作孤注之一擲、但頻頻犯規、反使比賽减少興趣、而於大局　補、僅由茂雷與白爾特各中一球、中華方面、又得七分、最後一分鐘時、中華後臺老　陸鍾恩四次犯規罰出、幸與大局無妨、結果成四十七比三十五、中華得首次之勝利、</p>

<h3>治將領不戰而退的一種良藥</h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>熱河承德又告失陷，湯玉麟不戰而逃，唉！我聽了這一個消息，這　醒悟，知道吾們中國養兵數百萬，耗去軍費幾億兆兩，都是人民的膏血，白白化去，竟一些没有用！後來一想，照這種的打仗，當那末曾交綏之前，像煞架子　得十足，剛一接觸，那就翻轉脚底給敵人一看，這還了得，所以我把前人［治不戰而退的方法］來照述一下，或者也可使北方手中尚握着兵柄的他們，有些警醒，什麽方法呢？要他們去脚踏戰地，必先要他們知道羞恥，要他們知道羞恥，那末政府也先要有法，倘若没有法，那末部屬自然也没有勇氣殺敵，現在一閧而前一嚇而退的這種打仗，指揮的，當兵的，老實説，個個心理，抱著不肯去死，最好僥倖得生以爲上策，這樣，試問還可以苦守疆土，戰勝敵人麽？自然像孟子所説的［棄甲曳兵而一溜之乎也了，所以從前兵書上説得好，呌［教戰必先明恥，明恥必先勅法，］你若舍此兩句前人的話不用，那就糟了。</p>
<p>方法要怎樣用，現在秉軍政的當軸，趕快嚴頒一種禁令，布告一般抗日的將士們，一遇敵潰走，藉詞巧避者，殺無赦，臨陣不相救，貽誤軍機者，殺無赦，堵禦不力，致敵逃竄者，殺無赦。］軍令一嚴，士氣也就大振，而且賞罰旣明，那個有功，那個有罪，　成了鐵案，不慮没有英雄豪傑一輩人出來救國了，遠的不論，我且把前清的一朝來説，金川的一役，經略張廣泗敗了，回部的一役，將軍雅可哈善敗了，烏什的一役參贊納世通敗了，缅甸一役，大學士　應琚也敗了，當時清廷尚能拿國法來聲其敗續的罪狀，和失地的處分，一個一個誅戮了，唉！難道現在偌太的中央政府，這種　　都没有，倒反不及從前的亡　麽？</p>
<h3>上海的過乘</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>丨無法救濟丨</p>
<p>上海這麽一個東方大都會，看似十分繁榮，百般熱閙，若是閉一隻眼，睜一隻眼的仔細一瞧，各個社會裏，都感着過剩的恐慌。</p>
<p>第一是上海婦女的過剩。晚上走過大世界東南西北幾條街，無量數的青年女子，站在那裏追求男性。遊戲場，大旅社，咖啡座，跳舞塲，都有在這過量生産制度下面無法傾銷的女子屯積着。</p>
<p>第二是人才的過剩。製造人才的學校，機械化的每年製造出大批人才來，望社會上傾銷。小小的社會，容不下在數量上取之無盡的人才，於是人才不得不自動的跌價，以求早日脱手。所以招請書記，月薪二十元的廣告一發表，高中畢業生，大學生，都會前來應試的。</p>
<p>第三是鈔票過剩。銀行裏儘着一千萬八百萬兒的發行，由銀行交給資本家，資本家分給窮人，窮人拿回家去，糴米，買柴，付租，贖當，不到三天，已又經资本家之手，存入銀行。於是銀行感於鈔票的過剩，不得不再想法傾銷到市面上去。</p>
<p>第四是房屋的過剩。上海人愛趕熱閙，就是住房子，也喜歡七八家擠在一個石庫門裏，多搭幾個擱樓，倒是滿不在乎，反正祗要熱閙就是了。這倒不打緊，却苦了地産公司與大房東，造了三上三下，五上五下，三層樓，四層樓的房屋，没人過問。</p>
<p>上海過剩的東西，正多着咧，一時也说不了許多。就以我們投稿的文丐而論，枯腸中正苦着材料過剩，無法排洩。</p>
<p>至於各個雜誌，報章的編輯室裏，那一家不是受着稿子過剩的累，累得茶房老爺，每天要倒一下子字紙簍。</p>
<h3>蜜蜂的剌</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>玫瑰的剌，與蜜蜂的剌，都是剌人呌痛的東西；可是人們喜歡接受玫瑰的剌，而不願接受蜜蜂的剌，這是什麽心理？</p>
<p>把繡花細鍼，在富人肌肉上剌了一下，必定［嗳唷唷］呌痛；要是把富人的皮，從頭上剝了下來，也不過喊幾聲［嗳唷唷］吧了，這是什麽心理？</p>
<p>不會用錢的守財奴，將來定把成千成萬學生心血换來的金錢，給素不認識的人享用。甚麽呌做素不認識的人？守財奴的曾孫玄孫，不是守財奴素不認識的人嗎？</p>
<p>衛生大家和醫生最怕微生蟲，説是傳染疾病的惡魔；甚麽毛巾啦，郵票啦，指爪啦，都是病菌的大本營，非要留心不可。可是女人的櫻唇，以及花花綠綠的鈔票，什麽病菌不病菌，傳染不傳染，拚命也要和　親　了。</p>
<h3>字紙簍</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>丨日人的狡計丨</p>
<p>字紙簍這樣東西，談起他的本能，不過能盛放些破紙敗貝，和些零星没用扯碎的字紙用的，在他的本身，用幾根極輕薄的竹片，就能紥成，這樣東西，是不值得人重視，不值得人注意的。</p>
<p>字紙簍不但没人重視，並且有一部份文人丨投稿家丨與他反對，他蹲在報館内編輯室裏，每每因看稿的先生和他親善，他能很不客氣地吞没投稿者的心血結晶，他的身份，除非一般舊腦筋舊道德家，因［敬惜字紙］的原故，腦板上常鐫着［字紙簍］三個字外，其餘什麽人也不把他放在心裏，在最近數日之前，本報曾載着一段漢口專電；</p>
<p>［日人多方剌探我方軍政情形，收買各機關字紙簍，每只五十元，當局已令各機關嚴防，］</p>
<p>看以上所載，以不經人注意的字紙簍，日人竟願以五十元代價相購，重利啗人，他們所用的毒計，眞是旣狡且辣，我從這一段事實上，細細的尋思，以一個輕微没用的字紙簍，日人因探聽我國情形，不惜重金買去，却從破紙堆中尋求事實，這些地方，越是看出他人心細，我們國内同胞，越是要加十二分防範，日人心計雖狡，也就無所用了！</p>
<h3>黃包車釣魚</h3>
<p>— 朱衣</p>
<p>丨十字街頭素描丨</p>
<p>遠遠地一乘黃包車急速的來了。因爲走得太快的原故，車夫脚下一不留意，被石子一絆，手上一滑，遂演了一齣大翻身丨釣魚丨的趣劇。在車夫方面，是出於不得已；乘客方面，也無可奈何；而看閑的人却大起議論了。</p>
<p>［喂！街市中心，不是河裏，爲什麽釣起魚來？笑話！笑話！］這位是一個現代淳于　一流的人物。</p>
<p>［這位先生翻跟頭的工夫，刮刮呌！你看：他能由黃包車上，翻到地下。高明極了！］又是一位東方卓别麟的口吻。　　［車夫！車夫！你不高興做這筆生意，就可直接回了人家，不應當把暗苦給人吃。］這位却是類似政客善于挑剔輕浮的少年。</p>
<p>［男跌陰女跌晴，大約天又要下雨了！所以···］預言家在説。</p>
<p>［黃包車夫，太大意了！今天拉的是這位先生，不要緊；如果要拉一位懷孕的人，怎樣辦呢？］批評家教導了。</p>
<p>［可惜！可惜！一件新鮮的衣服，弄污］丨日日燒香念佛的婆婆爲愛惜衣服而發言。</p>
<p>乘客臉紅紅地看看污了的衣服，急怱怱地去了；車夫翻過車子，理好車墊等東西，拉起車子，埀着頭，慢慢的拉到别處去：看閑的人談論也止了。</p>
<p>但是我們從這一點，可以到國人的看劣根性的暴露。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第一回</p>
<p>推食殷勤偏邀貧女憶</p>
<p>入門慷慨别具武夫雄</p>
<p>趙自强見這裏兩間屋子，小得也就只好有轉身之地。外面這間屋子，堆了煤球，破棹椅，缸罐，破泥爐子。裏面一間屋子，一張土坑，佔去了屋子裏三分之二的地方。坑頭邊放了一張二屜小棹，這邊靠了坑，那邊就靠了牆，此外，便只有一張小方凳子，一張破椅子，什麽也没有了。坑上舖着的蘆篠坑席，都麻花了幾塊，靠墻的坑頭上，有個藍布的舖蓋捲兒，上面壓了兩個藍布圓枕頭。舖蓋邊有個破籐籃子，和一個破黑木箱子，這就是伊們的家産。這樣看起來楊家可是很窮的人家。江氏見他走進屋來，很有些躊躇的神氣，料着人家是無處安身，便笑道：我們這窮人家，可是連坐的地方都没有，您就在坑上坐着罷。趙自强笑道：以後咱們共一個大門了，來來去去，您都别客氣。説着，正向坑上坐下，却聽到外面屋子裏，有個女子的聲音呌着道：媽，您快來，您快來，我拿不了。説着話，一個二十附近的姑娘，提了一大籃子白菜，幌着身軀跌了進來。猛然看到一個穿軍衣的人，坐在自己坑沿上，不由得大吃一驚，放下那一籃子白菜，身子向後一縮，退到門外去。趙自强知道這是江氏的女兒，可是看到人家這樣吃驚的樣子，却不知爲了何事，站將起來，也爲之愕然。江氏便笑道：這是我姑娘，伊臉皮子嫩，見人是説不出話來的。趙自强笑道：也是我冒昧一點，一個當大兵的人，怎麽好胡亂的闖到人家家裏來呢？我告退了，説畢，就要向外面走。江氏看了，倒十分不過意，便笑道：憑你這樣一説，當軍人的還不能出大門呢。老姑娘，來，這就是賃咱們後院屋子的趙連長。老姑娘這才進來，向他點着頭道：請坐一會兒，喝碗水再走，我們這裏，是站的地方都没有。（九）</p>

<h3>嬰孩幸福</h3>
<p>— 佩英</p>
<p>讀者諸君，聽見過西方這些關於嬰孩的民間常識和奇怪迷信嗎？</p>
<p>未曾把嬰孩抱下過樓來以前，應該時常把他抱上樓去，假如這家人没有梯的，或者没有更上一層樓的樓梯，那麽養育嬰孩的保姆，應該把他抱在懷中，立到椅子上去。這是表示這個孩子將來在世界上可以卓然自立。</p>
<p>一個嬰孩呱呱墮地的一天，假如家裏的雌雞也生下一個蛋來，這個蛋是［幸福之蛋］，應當獻給嬰孩，永遠替他保存好。</p>
<p>嬰孩出生後第一次抱出門去，應當給他一個雞蛋，一塊麵包和少許食鹽，而且就在同一地方，相信以錢幣給他，也是幸福無　的。他們以爲送這種禮物，是表示這個小孩將來不會貧乏的。</p>
<p>摇動一隻空的摇床，以爲是有非常災禍的。在瑞典，他們相信摇了空摇床，要使小孩變爲吵閙的。荷蘭人説遥動空摇床，表示太不吉利，甚至使小孩夭折。</p>
<p>在英吉利的西部，嬰孩的右手是不洗的，等到受過施洗禮之後，方始替他洗，這是表示他將來會富的。</p>
<p>有許多地方，婴孩的指甲，是不剪去的，等到滿了一歳，然後嬰孩的母親，用牙齒來把他的指甲咬去，不剪而咬去的緣故，照我所知道，大槪他們都相信着，如其用剪刀來剪去，小孩將來不免要做小竊的。</p>
<p>有幾處地方，嬰孩第一次剪下來的指甲，要埋在槐樹下面，這種樹在從前的時候，是認爲聖樹的。他們宣稱這樣做了，這個孩子將來大起來，可以成爲一個著名的歌唱家。</p>
<p>假如一個嬰孩在受施洗禮的時候，哭起來了，那是他設法把在他四周埋伏以待的惡魔驚走的。有許多人以爲嬰孩的哭，是嬰孩身邊的惡魔，被施洗禮的水所驅逐而發出來的聲音，假如他在這時候並不哭泣，那麽他將來大起來，他的脾氣定是頑劣的，他的行爲定是邪惡的。我又聽見人家説，在受施洗禮時的好哭，預言他將來有健康而永久的生命。</p>
<p>在意大利，人們相信有一隻蝴蝶在嬰孩的摇床四週飛來飛去，那是嬰孩的護衛安琪兒。</p>
<p>在愛爾蘭，人們以爲有一種惡魔，專來把嬰孩偷去，而遺留一種代替物。自從知道這種惡魔對於冷冰冰的鐵，不甚喜歡而有些怕　之後，他們便在摇床上，置放一根火棒，使他遠而避之。丹麥母親因爲要保護伊們摇床裏的嬰孩，所以在摇床裏放些尖鋭的器物。</p>
<p>在蘇格蘭，小孩第一次會拿東西吃的時候，非常留心地察看，看他用那一隻手來拿食物，放到嘴裏去，假如他用左手來拿，父母一定要嘆氣，説他將來的命運，不甚佳妙的。</p>
<p>在瑞典，一個新産的嬰孩的頭下，要放一本書，據説可以使他將來快些識字讀書。他們又説，在一個嬰孩未受施洗禮以前的時期中，燈火永遠不能熄滅的，否則惡魔就要光臨，而且在母親哺乳的時候，嬰孩與燈火之間，無論如何不能有人在此走過的。</p>
<p>在星期日出世的孩子，大家以爲是有幸福的；假如一個嬰孩，頸上有一痣，認爲特别的有幸福，有詩爲證：</p>
<p>［頸上一粒痣，</p>
<p>賺錢不勝計。］</p>

<p>晨開時毛盤曾喊七百兩、蓋因匯市開出近期英匯一先令九便士美匯三十二元二五、較前收俱緊、福餘等納條、曾升至零五兩外、住友扒六月份美金三十三元六二五也、其後此價難出、價漸退至零三四兩、至九時半開盤爲七百零四兩、較前收漲起七兩三錢、春源永福餘上塲進條、漲至五兩外、志豐永元春亦購、而至八兩外、匯市略緊、六月份美金半元不能結進、乃升至九兩、此際協興永曾來進條、但因丙興限盤售條、而未見再升、散户紛紛脱手、遂見退下、爲七兩光景、生大宏利來進、拉起一兩、大興永猛來賣出、跌至五兩半、至此匯市仍緊、六月份美匯三七五銀行俱要、一哄而至八兩一錢、物品套出、降下二兩、恒餘元春俱購、升至九兩半、福昌則出、漸漸跌至七兩三錢、市况平庸、徘徊多時、丙興信恒　餘猛來進條、乃破沉寂之態、而見興旺、匯市亦緊、三一二五六月份似乎難結、遂穿十兩出外、曾漲至十一兩半、銀公司售予三菱六月份美金三一二五、志豐永源茂永俱來脱售、遂破至十兩内、但此時尚可支持、及至元春志豐永俱賣、降至零七兩八錢、然因銀行胃口仍穏、安達扒六月份美金祗一二五、源茂永忽來納進、重又升至十兩外、爲零八錢、生大脱手、仍在十兩光景徘徊、大德成更售、而至十兩内、物品套頭俱來套出、更跌至八兩半、福昌來進、散户抬價頗力、逐漸漲至十兩外、又爲零八錢、無如趨勢多盤、波折又起、外電美國畢德門提議請政府購買銀子、更有允許戰債可用銀償還之訊傳來順利首售至十兩内、元盛永亦出至九兩内、一時賣風　起、元亨亦出至七兩光景、匯市雖無成交、但似趨硬、丙興售條、更慘跌至五兩内、爲四兩半、源茂永來進、拉上一兩、無似人心轉虚、散户本多、至此已翻居空方、紛紛　價、匯市亦鬆、恒餘元盛永再來脱售、仍見下游、慶發永亦來脱手、遂跌至零二兩三錢、此時已迫收市、拉者亦衆、掙扎多時、卒見拉上兩餘、收盤遂爲七百零三兩半、收市後恒餘賣興未已、仍來脱售、續又降爲二兩光景、故物品拍二兩、查半日間極形平庸、上落不大、趨勢尚佳、計最高價七百十一兩半、最低價七百零二兩三錢、有九兩二錢相差、結果較前收又見上漲有六兩八錢、本月份登賬七百二十六兩、四月份七百零四兩、補水七百二十四兩、</p>

<p>掉期仍昂、三四月份初時竟由空方瑞康貼出二十五兩、計貼予大順大豐恒各十四條、愿掉出者頗多、蓋此價實已使現貨號滿意、故入後盈豐恒貼予大豐恒十四條、已爲二十兩矣、大德成貼予潤昌裕九十一條爲十九兩、</p>

<p>在東京的一個［我的朋友］來信説，［小林多喜二活活地被警察打死了］。時候是一九三三年二月二十日。信上没説詳細情形，那是因爲怕那邊檢查之故。翻翻日本報紙，也没有看見紀載。日本當局對於這事的（關防嚴密］，是可想見的。</p>
<p>這倒不怎麽意外。原來小林多喜二向來有點［不安分］，近來更跟着許多人反對侵略中國，反對帝國主義。被日本警察打死是不足怪的。</p>
<p>但是日本是個［法治國，］因此總不免有點感想什麽的。</p>
<p>又一個但是，則日本旣然有個政府，那麽日本政府當應然［當有保護自己而鎭壓那些危害自己的運動的權利］的呀。</p>
<p>不過他們仍然不澈底，對這［應當有的［權利］的行使，還要那麽臉嫩，還是要［關防嚴密］。</p>
<p>這是因爲他們有所顧忌。</p>
<p>他們侵略中國，屠殺中國民衆，説是爲了他們的什麽所謂生命線，他們是爲他們全國人找出路的。然而他們國内時常閙蹩扭。這回就是小林多喜二之死。這就告訴了我們，不但中國民族被迫害，被殘殺，他們國内也有人，爲了反對侵略中國，爲了反對帝國主義之故，被迫害，被殘殺。然則所謂生命線也者，是誰的生命線呢？這不但騙不了别人，連同是大和民族的日本人都騙不住了。他們所顧忌的是這個。</p>
<p>然而已經騙不住了。</p>
<p>哪，這就是他的眞面目。</p>
<h3>日本騎在馬頭上</h3>
<p>— 奎明譯</p>
<p>三月二日本紀事報載有　伯訥　日時發表關於中日，國聯以及民族主義談話一則，　摘譯於下，以　　者。</p>
<p>當記者們與蕭氏會晤時，有人問：（先生　成日本退出國聯嗎？］</p>
<p>蕭氏就將國聯劈頭大駡，説；［你問我贊成日本退出國聯嗎？日本退出國聯與否，和我有什麽相干呢？日本已經决定了，日本已經破壞國聯了，並且已經證實國聯的無用了。你們也曉得國聯的活動有兩方面：一方面是國聯秘書處，是處理外交事務的。牠祇會開會，討論，報告，而世人極少注意。我曾經出席過一次大會，但再也不敢作第二次的嘗試。因爲牠祇能討論着和計劃着阻止某種事件的發生。國聯活動的另一方面，就是國際勞工局，這個圑體，是一個頗不合法的組織，但是牠的工作，倒還差强人意］</p>
<p>蕭氏繼説：［你們旣然已經把一方面推翻了，那末你們就一塊兒破壞了罷。當你們開始攻擊中國的時候，當你們破壞了盟約的時候，國聯應該做點事情的，牠也應　早已制裁你們了；但是牠没有做什麽事情，牠也没有想到做什麽事情，牠的會員國祇是把軍火買給中日兩國，一直到現在，還是這樣。你們這次對中國的戰爭，不必用什麽武士道來戰勝中國，單是軍器也足以致勝了。老式的魯莽的光榮已經過去了，步兵也不像歐戰開始時的用得着啦，那時的步兵，不過是用來作一種最可笑的屠殺；不，你們是用現代的武器去攻擊他們，假使他們也有，也能用，那末他們也要向你們攻擊的。你們説這一切都是自衛行動，你們的打，都是自衛，那末一切的戰爭，都可説是自衛了。我是一個愛爾蘭人，愛爾蘭大約有四百萬人民，而英格蘭却有四千萬人口，但英格蘭人决不能使愛爾蘭人忘記他們自己的國籍，雖然英格蘭人用盡了鐵和血，燒和殺來壓服愛爾蘭人。滿洲有三千萬中國人民，你們怎麽能夠制服他們呢？你們不能用警察去壓迫他們，無論如何警察是没有用的，是完全没有效力的，除非人民需要他的時候，方才有用。但是中國人現在不需要他們，所以一個問題就發生了，便是將來百年中，你們是否預備用武力去壓制他們？］　　蕭氏又對記者們説，他現在已經七十歳了，在他少年的時候，英國還是用馬來代步，但有時馬在路上滑倒了，［這是什麽緣故呢？這便是因爲大家喜歡坐在馬頭上，但是馬鞍和槍桿都使牠不舒服，所以牠便掀起來滑倒地上了。你們壓服民族主義的勃興，彷彿坐在馬頭上一樣，於是别的事情都不能做了。愛爾蘭人使得英國國會三十多年以來，什麽事情都不能做，一天到晚討論着愛爾蘭問題。假使你們下一世紀坐在那個馬頭上，你們將碰着些什麽事情呢？你們呌那一個去做呢？並且這個事情是否能夠做的呢？我想你們的國家主義者和愛國者，是不情願去做的，因爲他們正忙着討論呢！祇有　貨才會　國家主義，祇有　貨在談論着他們歷史上的自由和光榮。當你們最後得到國家最强的時候，你們會立刻需要槍殺你們的國家主義者的。但是在這個時候，你們什麽都没有做，你們對於這椿事情，是否具有遠大的眼光？征服了中國，你們想日本會變成怎樣？中國人繼續不斷的起來爭門是必然的，最後你們會想到非用一個警察去監視一個中國人不可，</p>
<p>當蕭氏這樣高聲談論的時候，記者們呆若木鷄，鉛筆都停了。這個時候，蕭氏和他們約定的談話時間已過超過，聽衆們都注視着他，似乎表示出他年紀已老，没有禮貌，不配演講了。但他説［你們看我十分粗莽，但如果我祇有二十歳的話，我不會這樣坦白呢。］當時有人説起［武士道］，蕭氏便説［武士道是什麽意思？是不是就是你們所謂愛國主義的意思？但是一個愛國者使得他自己和他的國家變爲可笑，大都是應該槍殺的。］</p>
<p>蕭氏繼續問了幾個問題，又説［你們是信仰什麽宗教的？你們是新聞記者，當然你們不信宗教，但是Ｂeppu地方的人民信仰些什麽宗教？他們還是信仰佛教呢，還是相信神道教呢，或另外什麽宗教呢？我以爲各種宗教都有一點眞實，所以我都相信。但是現在各種宗教都是腐敗的，好比佛教已不是眞正的佛教，你們不過塑了一座印度佛像，來欺騙他人，來叩求他。我在日本看了些什麽東西呢？一點也没有看到什麽。我原來不想看什麽東西，我到這裏來是偶然的，我想長期航海，所以我搭了這一隻船，可是這一隻船却又到了這裏，我也無可奈何。］</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（二十五）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯納作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>［　是詩人罷，我想，］造像的人説。</p>
<p>這樣的被人家打斷了話語的亞拉伯人通紅了臉；猛然站起身來，拔他的　刀了。［你　　陷我是唱道情的人麽？］他説。［這一個侮辱，得用血來洗掉牠。］</p>
<p>［對不起，］造像的人説。［我没有來冒犯你的意思。爲什麽造一首比　人的壽命　長的曲子，你覺得慚愧，造一個死屍，倒不慚愧呢？死屍是造成之後，還得將牠藏在地裏，以免　死人的。］</p>
<p>［不錯，］亞拉伯人説，一面將他的武器收回去，重復坐下。［每逢　旦做着不純潔的詩歌時候，上帝就打發一首聖曲來洗凈牠，這也是上帝的一個神秘啦。然而我足誠實的　駝夫，從未唱唱曲兒　過錢］，雖然老實説我也是很喜歡唱唱的。］</p>
<p>（我呢，也並不過分正經，］那術士説。［我是被人家呌　嘴佬和酒徒的。我没有禁食。我犯着安息日。我一向和不規矩的女人們要好。不孝我的母親，離棄我的家　：爲什麽呢？因爲人的眞正的家庭是這樣的家庭，這裏面上帝是父親，我們都是他的女兒們：並不是小氣派的人家和舖子，這裏面人等斷了奶　離得開娘身邊。］</p>
<p>［人要免得精神上的拘束，必須有許多妻子和大大的家庭，］阿拉伯人説。［他應當將他的愛情分配開來纔好。他等到認識了許多女人，　能夠知道誰的價值，因爲價值是一個比較的問題呵。我等到發見了我最後的妻子是怎麽一個小妖精，纔知道我最先的妻子是怎麽一個老天使。］</p>
<p>［那麽，你的妻子們呢？］黑女孩子説。［她們也要認識許多男人的罷，爲的是她們可以明白你的價值？］</p>
<p>［上帝佑我，對付　旦的這個黑女兒，］亞拉伯人厲聲説。［女人呵，你得知道，每逢男人們談着天，談的題目是知　這些時候，你應當靜着纔好。神造女人以前就造了男人哩。］</p>
<p>［仔細想一想罷］黑女孩子説。［如果照你所説，那麽神一定是因爲他覺得男人不完全的緣故，纔創造女人的了。你憑着什麽權利，要求五十個妻子，罰她們合一個丈夫呢？］</p>
<p>［要是我得從新做一世人呢，］亞拉伯人説。［我就要做一個獨身的和尚，開起門來，不見女人，不同女人　夾了。可是你再想想看。如果我只有一個妻子，那就另外的女人都分不着我了，雖然有许多女人照着我的優秀和她們的識别力的比例多少想望着我。有識見的女人，相望着自己的兒女有最好的父親的，她與其獨有整個兒的臭皮囊呢，　一定寗可求得我的五十分之一分的。爲什麽她應當吃這一種不必吃的不公平的苦頭呢？］</p>
<h3>鄉居隨筆</h3>
<p>— 陳醉雲</p>
<p>太湖强盜</p>
<p>提起太湖强盜，大家總有點不寒而潥，什麽輪船被刦　，村莊被搶囉，報紙上常有記載。在不知底細的，或以爲他們據有山寨，幾乎像梁山泊的好漢一樣，憑險固守，官兵不敢去打；而他們也一輩子做强盜，除開出來打刦之外，總是整夥兒在山寨裏過活。</p>
<p>其實並不這樣。太湖中雖有［七十二峯，］但如洞庭山馬跡山等，果木成林，桑麻盈野，居民着實不少。如厥山澤山等，也有人家居住，多則百餘家，少亦數十家。有些山峽間，連　着魚池，菱塘，菰田，桑隄，分明是漁村水鄉，或者還可説是［世外桃源］呢，那像山寨模樣。并且也没有任何一峯一山可以據險而守。即使有那樣固定的境也可以嘯聚，但經了飛機巡艦的圍攻，還不易於撲滅嗎！</p>
<p>那麽，他們的存在與活動，靠着什麽呢？原來是利用繁複綜錯的港汶。他們没有壁壘，没有山寨，甚至没有固定的　夥。住在沿太湖山上灣上的許多客民，平時藉耕種打艱漁苦過活的，都有加入的可能。祇須由大頭目發起，再由小頭目分頭活動，在村間的小茶館裏接洽一下，就可由小股結成中股，由中股合成大幫，把預先埋藏着的槍械分配使用，其勢不難攻掠大鎭，豈僅攔襲輪船。等到刧罷，把贓物一分，除開大頭目仍留都市作［闊人］外，其餘均各散歸原地作［良民］，又好像其他安分的人一樣了。</p>

<h3>中日代表倫敦播音大舌戰</h3>
<p>郭泰祺大聲疾呼</p>
<p>切望英國予以道德上援助</p>
<p>松岡發狂妄謬論</p>
<p>對軍事侵略行動欲蓋彌彰</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日凡裝無綫電者均聆得日内瓦日本總代表松岡及駐倫敦中國公使郭祺泰之播音演説、松岡謂滿洲里遠東問題礎石、故日本不能容許仇視日本之人民管理之、此不獨爲日本生死問題、且爲避免遠東分裂紊亂之問、日本之不能在國聯提出滿洲問題、亦猶一九二七年英國之不能提出滬案耳、滿洲之發達、由於日本之發動及其事業、國聯並未嚴重反對日兵　助滿洲國　清兩北滿之非法分子、故渠不能何以國聯反對日本在熱河履行同樣工作、熱河因滿洲之一部也、事實　漸證明日本在滿行動之　　、滿洲國現已在達　願望之途中、日本之唯一目的、在恢復東亞之和平、而維持之云云、</p>
<p>郭泰祺在其播音演詞中力闢日本爲阻遏共産主義之屏障一説、謂日本政策在征服亞洲大陸、中國實屬無辜、李頓報告書與國聯大會皆已有此聲明、郭使臚舉九二六年以還之中國進步、謂中國不獨不排外、且準備與歐美國際合作、至於日本則爲揭亂之國、仇外　感　漫全國、尤以最近兩年爲甚、爲英國及歐洲利益計、日本侵略須加制止、如國聯會員　　護國聯盟約、則即可制止侵略、而侵略亦將自止矣、中國人民希望國爲世界表率、首先對於日本軍閥拒絶其作戰所需之物品、英國祇須作道德上之主張、對於侵略國拒絶外交上財政上商業上之輔助、即可消滅今日遠東之戰爭、且或可掃除將來各種戰爭也云云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本代表松岡洋右由法國加萊港來英、已於午後五　十五分行抵英國杜佛港、抵此後、松岡發表談話、謂英日同盟之宣告廢止、實保遠東　　主要原因之、又謂美國全部艦隊將繼續停泊太平洋中、此項决定、已在日本發生不良作用、實足惋惜、但日内瓦方面、渠　任職務現已終結、故上述全係個人意見、　日渠谱將以私人資格前往孟却斯德考察實業、渠現定於星期五日搭船取道紐约、遄返日本云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晚日本代表松岡洋右、及中國駐英公使郭泰祺、皆用無綫電廣播二人對於中日衝突之見解、播音地點不同、故二人並未晤面、松岡行抵播音臺時、有共産黨人一羣、對渠採取　對態度、但警察不令行近、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>禁械問題李頓發表意見</h3>
<p>中日不應一律待遇</p>
<p>（倫敦）國聯會滿洲調查圑主席李頓爵士、今日爲英政府禁止軍火運往中日兩國之决定作辯護、略謂一兩國之中、有一國已被現爲違反國聯盟約、故英國政府不能准許軍火運往該國、至對其他一國、則當由國　方　互相　協、在交戰　中分别畛　之後、始能允許軍火運往、　此　妥協無從實現、則禁止軍火出口之中、即當對於　國同時取銷］云云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>朝鮮全境赤化運動猛烈</h3>
<p>二月二十八日大阪朝日新聞云、朝鮮之左翼運動、自去年春季以來、因民族運動　微之反動現象、漸加熾烈之度、特對於表面上裝合法的假面具之赤色農民組合的秘密工作、以及由俄國潛入之共産大學畢業生等、暗中活動、勢甚激烈、本年一月以來、朝鮮共産黨之再建運動、竟蔓　全境、經　　當局秘密偵知、即以總督　警務局、　總本部、分令　南京　兩道警察部、開始大活動、同時禁止朝鮮全境各種報紙、　載一切消息、始於二月上旬、經　南京　　道之偵探、漸得端緒、　日前確知　山　州　加藤精米所職工爲中心、有强固赤色細胞圑潛伏、首將行動可疑分子檢舉數名、經嚴密審訊結果、供出慶南晋明四川·南海·固城·馬山等處各工塲勞動者、與京畿道内互相連絡、行將發　　　再違大運動、获原慶南道警務當局、急遽與各方警務局京畿道等、將指揮首　　逮捕數名、其他重要分子、因未明全部情形、尚在密查中云、</p>
<h3>歐洲政治家將集合日内瓦</h3>
<p>歐洲政局错綜參雜亟待解决</p>
<p>英相晤各代表討論遠東問題</p>
<p>路透十一日倫敦電今後數星期内歐洲政治家將集於日内瓦、舉行秘密會議、不特討論挽救　縮會議之方法、且將涉及歐洲之政局、法國今所　心者、爲斯特拉斯堡區之事務、昨有國社黨挺進隊若干人、闖入不設軍防區域、佔據斯特拉斯堡之市政廳、及萊因河濱之營房、德國當局後對於此事、有所解釋、但法政府能否滿意、今尚未定、衆意斯特拉斯堡事件、殊有碍軍縮會議前途之希望、聞意相墨索里尼現有赴日内瓦贊助英相麥唐納之意、蓋法西斯黨對於德總理希特勒之派行政委員制服巴伐利亞與陸克遜二邦政府、威權日大、頗爲不安故也、加以波蘭因但澤時局不定、曾派兵集於格第尼亞、德國現已請國聯制止之、故日内瓦之諸政治家今後應辦之事正多也、</p>
<p>路透十一日日内瓦電英相麥唐納抵此後、甚爲忙碌、分晤捷克代表皮尼士·軍縮會議主席　德森·意代表阿洛錫·美代表　爾　·及希臘代表波立狄斯聞麥唐納曾與各代表討論遠東時局·軍縮事件、及對遠東軍火禁令問題、此間一般人對於軍縮會之前途、認爲悲觀、軍縮會現幾已至完全破裂之階級、苟無勇邁的補救方法、則將無以避免　崩潰、</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>「左傾」與「右傾」</h3>
<p>「喂！我看你們這業餘的內容，倒很有點左傾的趨勢，」這是日前一位朋友向記者說的話。我當時聽了不覺嚇了一跳，忙請教他是何所見而云然，並請他給一個他所謂「左傾」的界說。他說：「這是顯而易見的事實啊！你看你們所描寫的問題」，差不多整個是說工人如何受苦，學徒是怎樣的遭虐待，其他如左一個帝國主義長，右一個資本主義短，稍有常識的人，即可一望而知，你們編者，又何必要明知而故昧呢！至于「左傾」的界說，那更毋庸詞費了，還有誰不知道嗎！所謂左傾，就是不滿現社會下的制度而欲改造的一類議論，所以左傾的思想，在負有維持現社會制度和秩序的人看來，就有反動的嫌疑與危險性。」記者聽了，不覺啞然失笑的向這位朋友說道：「我們編者的責任並不是要發揮我們自已的什麼主張，乃是做工商界朋友們的喉舌，發表他們所要發表的話，所以關于「工人如何的受苦，學徒怎樣的遭虐待」，這全是社會的呼聲，投稿者自已的敘述，我們所要注意的，就是這類敘述，是否為事實，是否為現社會下的病態。此外如帝國主義，資本主義，則更為今日全世界歷史家所公認的兩種大主義，亦更非區區編者所可以憑空說長說短的問題，此之謂左傾，殊不知右傾又應如何呢？若說不滿現社會下的不良制度，大聲疾呼，冀圖改善，就謂之左傾，那末豈不是說右傾就是粉飾太平，欺人自欺的表示了嗎？按之實際，我們編者，不管什么「左」或「右」，我們祗知道人類的社會是進步的社會，凡是與社會進步有關的呼聲，都為我們所樂于發表的材料。」</p>

<h3>寫給母親的信</h3>
<p>— 孟巧寶女士作</p>
<p>紗廠女工</p>
<p>母親：這是我到上海以後，寫給你們的第一封信。</p>
<p>光陰眞快，自從今年二月間離家以來，不知不覺有三禮拜過去了！在家裏呢，種田，割稻，養豬，飼蠶，忙的不得開交，而在外面的人呢，正是「海闊洋洋，忘記爹娘」，一天到晚替資本家做牛馬！廠裏面十二個鐘頭的工做了出來，又要燒飯，又要洗衣，實在什麼心思都沒有了！廠裏規定：一禮拜日工，一禮拜夜工。總之，日工也好，夜工也好，第天睡不到六個鐘頭。進廠出廠，都呌「過關」，因為進進出出，印度阿三都要搜過，防的工人將東西偷出去。工錢半個月一發，進去時先要扣半月「存工」，</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>留在廠裏作抵押品。工錢最好的八九毛錢一天，那就要做［宕管］，做［那摩温］了，像我這樣，二毛三毛是不一定。生活一點做壞，成者做夜工時打瞌睡，或者看見考工　生不放笑臉，那就要罰工錢吃［栗子壳］的。這正像某小説中所説：</p>
<p>［阿翠！飯燒好没有？五點鐘快到了。］亭子間嫂嫂一手托着青菜，一手拿着鉛　在半扶梯上對她女兒呌着。</p>
<p>阿翠的面孔是黃黃的。她的母親因爲要博得廠裏的先生們底埀青少扣一點工錢，不得不在吃［高郵　蛋］當中省幾個銅板下來給她買些［雪花膏］！</p>
<p>母親！就這是上海灘上一般所過的女工生活！</p>
<p>仔細一想，做人也眞是没有一點趣味。假使我正月念五出天花時傷了命倒也乾乾凈凈，但偏偏又會得好了起來，要在這地獄中婆娑着！有時候，我夜裏常常這樣的想：［一個女孩子大了起來究竟怎樣才好，美娟姊姊許的人家總算不錯，但看她的心裏總老是不愉快；素娥碰見我時，常要流出眼涙來，大槪總有説不出的痛苦啊！春菊，小玲，看她們都自苦自得知；像阿明嫂嫂，金美這種境地丨青年守寡那更是不必説了！唉，像我這樣不曉得將來會到了怎樣的一種地步？···］</p>
<p>母親身體康健，我很歡喜！爹爹做事順當嗎？記念得很！我做夢看見爹爹挑着穀担進小堂前去，姊姊抱着小生跟了去看。但我的夢常常給弄堂外面拉胡琴的聲音驚醒，每次聽見了這種聲音，就要使我想起我們廠裏唱慣了的一隻小調來：</p>
<p>［自從進工廠，手勞脚又忙！ＸＸＸ，虐待我，凶惡如豺狼。工作十二時，工資又渺茫：上難供父母，下難養兒郎！·····］</p>
<p>我從前没有到上海來時，總以爲上海就是西天：待到了上海，纔知道完全不是那樣子，尤其是我們工人的上海。實在，我們住的地方已經是上海的鄉下了，所以這裏的人到大馬路去，都説是［到上海去］。</p>
<p>大嫂在閘北做工，大約隔一禮拜來看我一次。她總是那副笑嘻嘻的樣子，好像銀行裏存着一筆欵子似的，而其實，她這件衣服脱下來只有五毛錢好當呢！昨天她又來看我，但不知怎的，她忽然哭了起來。我再三問她心裏有什麽委屈，她總是不肯説。唉！她是和我一樣的軟弱。</p>
<p>有人説，婦女解放須要經過一番大風大浪才行，這句話我現在有一點兒相信了。</p>
<h3>兩種不同的女工</h3>
<p>— 敏</p>
<p>高跟皮鞋，皮大衣，　過的頭髮，塗了腥紅的嘴唇，扭扭揑揑走在馬路上的，那個不説她是摩登女郎？有誰知道她是一天做到晚，或一夜做到天亮的紗廠勞工呢？她自己也極力要瞞過旁人的耳目，將裝冷飯的飯籃，預先呌人代帶走了，將身上的棉花毛屑，刷揩得乾乾淨淨。她們當然是紗廠女工中的最少數，但一家有五六萬錠子的紗廠，至少有這樣的女工三四十個吧。她們是比較的有着高的地位，做着輕鬆的工作，每天可賺到五六角至八九角錢。可是她們往往逃不出廠裏職員的手掌，説説笑笑，當然毫没有男女的顧忌，即在機弄旁邊的摸摸索索，也算不了一回事，至於開棧房，或即在工房中幽會而被人捉奸一類的喜劇，也常常的扮演着。在職員固恃有權勢，容易勾引她們，但在女工方面，因爲家境不好，從小没有福氣受教育，自然也不免有不能潔身自愛的人。她們脱離了家庭的束縛，跑到大都會來做工，經不起種種的引誘暗示，如何能把持得住？所以她們，不論時髦的，不時髦的，美的醜的，不要説和職員，就是與同廠的男工，以及廠外一般游手好閒的人，均容易閙出笑話來。</p>
<p>另外有一種工人。她們好像終年不梳洗似的，頸上手上，積滿了污垢，衣服也　褸而骯　；走到人前，即有一種異味衝到人家的鼻管裏。而她們的腦筋，因爲受了生活的磨折，也像特别遲鈍的，往往對於極容易的事情，不會處置，或極簡單的數目，也不會計算。她們從家裏到廠裏，無處不受人欺侮：在路上會給人打翻飯籃：在廠門口，稍勿識相，會接受巡捕的火腿，在車間中更時時會受職員的　工錢，及遭女工頭的攔頭攔面亂打一陣。她們總是那副又像哭，又像笑的没有變化的呆臉。她們每天可賺三四角錢，甚至祇有一角多錢的，而且還要被她們的頭目吞没扣蝕了些。不過，她們很會將廠裏的棉咧，紗咧，零件咧，暗地裏偷到家裏去；［窮困］逼迫着她們這樣的做。</p>
<p>上述這兩種工人雖不能説是紗廠女工的大多數，但可以代表同稱爲勞動階級的女工的兩方面。其餘還有一大部份女工她們無非是每天隨着人潮在工廠的喉　裏被吞入吐出，從天尚未明時做到晚上，或從太陽西落時做到太陽再從東方出來，至少有十二小時的工作，多的要做到十三至十五小時。她們受着種種的壓迫和侮辱，將海躍的生命在機聲隆隆中消磨掉，將鮮紅的血液漸漸　　夜旋轉不息的大輪吮吸盡，　常時要担心到夜飯米的多少，至於當着雪飛冰凍的時候要想添件寒衣，那更是不容易的啊！</p>
<h3>紫茄兒和熟山芋</h3>
<p>— 玲女士</p>
<p>一到冬天，白大裏我們樂器廠中幾乎滿眼都是紫茄兒和熟山芋，老是摇幌不定的掛在那兒，總要到了晚上纔被一一搬走。這些東西都没有人要吃，尤其是熟山芋，有一股異樣的氣味，連碰都没有人要碰的。那末，爲什麽我們廠裏會有這許多的紫茄兒和熟山芋呢？好，且聽我道來！</p>
<p>樂器廠女工</p>
<p>我們每天要做十小時以上的工作：當晨鐘敲了六下，訓服的機器嘰嚘嘰嗄的旋轉着時，那榨取我們血汗的工作便開始了。我的左手拿着冰塊般冷的口琴坯，右手拿着同樣冷的刀兒，锉兒，镊子和小銅片子，交换的使用着，兩脚也不住的打着風琴抽。大家都是這樣不停的動着，做着，全屋子裏充滿了喧囂的閙聲丨丨音節不調的都，來，迷，法，沙，拉，西。冷風像小偷兒似的從窗縫中偷偷地進來，吹得我們不住的打着冷戰。我們買不起毛襪和手套，即使有手套，戴着也有礙於工作，而廠裏又没有火爐或熱水汀等設備。於是，我們每一個人的腕上便添了一對紫茄兒，而這就是我們的手呀！我們的腿上也添了一對熟山芋，而這就是我們被凍爛了的脚呀！</p>
<h3>誰是時代需要者</h3>
<p>— 紫薇</p>
<p>養蠶女</p>
<h3>昏暈</h3>
<p>— 周華國</p>
<p>去年夏季，我到一所蠶種製造塲去參觀。這是一個大規模的製種，全塲分好幾部：就以蠶業部而言，他們的工作人員有：技師一位，技術員七八位，女練習生四五十名，男工數十人丨採桑者丨臨時僱用的女工數十人。因爲是規模大，所以在春，夏，秋，養三季蠶，製三次種，其中要算夏蠶時期爲養蠶季中的最苦的一季。</p>
<p>她們如醫生一樣，穿着白色的制服。在走進蠶室時要换上另一種拖鞋。因爲蠶室内的一切用具都要消毒的。蠶室裏非常清潔，而空氣又很流通（這些對於蠶都是必需的養育環境）。没有走進蠶室時，三點聽不到聲音，雖然有無數的人在工作着，但她們却是很鎭靜而穏當的。在蠶室裏祗聽見無限的　，　，　，的蠶兒食葉聲。</p>
<p>從收　起，一直到蠶兒上簇，她們的工作，大槪是　葉，除沙等。每天　葉的次數是很多的。除白天外，每晚也必得給葉一次，所以在蠶期中，她們從來不能安睡一夜的。晚上　葉的時間，大槪在十二時左右。每次　葉的工作，總在二小時以上。因爲每人要擔任幾十匾蠶。在夜晚給葉之後，在清早五時又須給葉，中間相隔不遠，所以她們差不多是不大睡覺的。可是這樣的情况，並不是一日，三個蠶季都是如此。因此，這種勞苦的蠶業工作，時常是會嚇退一般人的。我參觀的那個製種塲，本來有二個男練習生，其中的一個，早就因受不了這種苦而走了，而尚留着的一個，那時也已向當局説明不幹了。這樣看來，她們工作的辛苦，非但在與男子比較後可看出，就是從她們時常在蠶室裏發生的［窒息］［昏暈］這類事中，也可知道了。</p>
<p>她們之中工作得最苦的當然是練習生。這些女練習生，大槪都是貧家之女　富家的嬌弱的小姐們，她們只能以她們的　手去坐在什麽［宫］裏玩弄她們的　愛把戲的，此種工作之苦，是非她們所夢想得到的。她們每次從蠶室裏出來，她們身上的衣服是全被汗水浸濕了的。於是她們便回到寢室裏去换衣，至是纔得去享受一下短時的休息，散在塲内各蔭蔽處乘凉，休息，有的却還要在房子裏寫信，做雜。到炎日下山了的晚飯後，比較清凉的時候，她們全去洗衣。白天裏换下的汗濕衣衫，她們就在這時爲自己洗滌。</p>
<p>這些製種塲也是一些資本家經營的。他們爲私人　利　對於工作的待遇　降到最低限度。這些所謂練習生簡直是無所謂待遇的，祗有得　僅少的十幾元的津貼。所以，她們在所謂練習生的名義下，做了無工資的資本家的生産的工人了。</p>
<p>女童工</p>
<h3>後樓</h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>我住的那間屋子，是一幢單開間石庫門的樓房，二層閣三層閣露天閣樓，統統住滿了，房客共有十一家，差不多的旅館也不比我們這裏的人更多。在這裏我雖是住了半年多，但對於一些同居的人，我到現在都還不曉得他們姓什麽，做什麽職業：不過天天早晨，聽得附近的Ｃ紗數的回聲響了，他們就都走了，因此我猜想他們大多數是在紗廠裏做工的。還有一點確切的證明，就是看見她們晚上回來，頭髮上還有些没有拂乾凈的花絨，有了這個特徵，我才覺得我推測的不錯。還有點懷疑的是住在後樓的小女孩，看她的身材頂多不過十歳，臉色黃澄澄的，顯出她那營養不足的貧血病態。未必她也和大人一樣的做工吧？這是從早上七點鐘我出去時没有看到過她；到了晚上又聽到她在帮她母親燒飯，因此懷疑她究竟是不是做工去的。這一點子大的人也能做工，眞使我不相信了；但這也祇好算作疑問罷了，决不能無故去向人家追究這椿不必要的事的。</p>
<p>有一天，是星期日的早晨，她母女俩都没進廠做工。我在星期日向來是無事可做，但從没看到過她們閒着在家裏，就是樓下的同居者，今天也還是照常工作，怎麽她母女俩又得休息？我心裏又在這麽的懷疑着。</p>
<p>［後樓嫂嫂！你今天是該休息的］終於忍不住藴在心裏的疑問，我把牠吐了出來，像鬆了一塊石頭似的輕快。</p>
<p>［哼！我們那裏會有休息，像條耕田的牛樣？不病倒是不會有休息的時候！丨丨小翠不是病倒了嗎？不然，唔！想請假都不成功！］她説，聲音有些顫抖而憤激。</p>
<p>［哦！小翠，就是那一點點高的女孩子麽？昨天晚上不是好好的嗎？怎麽没聽到説就病了！····眞可憐！那麽點大的女孩子讓她去做工，不是太糟躍了麽？····］</p>
<p>［····這也是無法的事呵！要是不做·家裏就不夠開銷。廠裏像我們這種人我着呢！你要不想做，還有許多人要做得不到丨丨丨不是嗎？小翠做的這椿事，起先就有好多和她差不多長大的女孩子們，託人向那個工頭保薦。後來若不是阿根叔帮忙我們，早就給人家搶去了。］</p>
<p>［想必翠這件事總是個好位子？···］</p>
<p>［哎唷！那裏是什麽好位子：陳先生，分明是要吃飯的人太多了！布機間的生活，重就重得要死，一天到晚站在機器旁邊，眼睛老是釘着那管梭子，跳紗多了要扣工錢的，要是不當心的話。］　　［小翠那麽點點大做得動嗎？一天有幾多工錢？是活工嗎？］</p>
<p>［做不動也得要做。還算好，許多同事的姊妹淘裏都不討厭她：有些事情她們還肯帮忙她。頭兩個月是没有錢拿回來，現在倒可以賺三毛多錢一天；娘兒俩個也祗能各顧自身的。］</p>
<p>［有規例嗎，頭兩個月没有工錢？······］</p>
<p>［嘻嘻！陳先生眞是外行！你知道現在想在纱廠裏做事，眞不便宜；雖則没有寫出什麽規例來，暗地裏却得要在管工的那裏花錢，而且花錢還要有門路。小翠還虧阿根叔和管工的要好，才祗花了一個月的工錢，其餘的一個月照規矩是没有錢的。］</p>
<p>我給她笑得有些難爲情了，不好再問什麽，恐怕問得牛頭不對馬嘴，更會把人家的牙齒笑掉了。</p>

<h3>散工後</h3>
<p>— 駕滿</p>
<p>一羣一羣的，一夥一夥的充滿在馬路上的盡是些數不清的女工，看過去，像片片的巨浪，像廣泛的湧潮，激　着，湧伏着，過來了，一會兒又過去了，消逝了。</p>
<p>有哭聲，有嘶閙聲，有奔跑聲，吵閙的，雜亂的，遠遠的傳布過來，慢慢的傳散開去。</p>
<p>她們的身上，常常是掛有一些棉絮，或是碎缐，但，也有些人另穿上時式的旗袍，混在一路奔走。人人的手中，提着竹製的飯籃，再不然就是洋瓷的飯盒子。</p>
<p>時候正值日落，她們停下了一天的勞苦工作，散工了。工廠像一座火山，又像一個瀑布，從山口噴出無數的砂礫，從瀑布中洩出無限的水沬，微淡的電燈照着，又會看成是大羣的螞蟻世界，在翻動着，翻動着。</p>
<p>偶然在街上馳來一列電車或是汽車，砂礫也罷，水沬也罷，蟻羣也罷，就立時的，切劃出一條空溝，隨着車影消失後，空溝又塡平了砂礫水沬與蟻羣。　　這時候的街面，簡直是工人的世界，不，是女工的世界，她們，佔有了街面的一切！［多麽偉大呀，可敬仰欽佩的女工們！］同時，把街面上另外佔有一點地位的建築與路人，顯得渺小極了，比地面上一顆砂礫還要渺小！</p>
<p>［張阿姊，明天見哪。］</p>
<p>［二妹，明天早早來呀。］</p>
<p>［阿貴嫂，明天會。］</p>
<p>到該要分手地方，一些彼此相熟的，大家説着話，然後各自奔着各自的歸途。她們也更説些笑話呢；</p>
<p>［劉二嫂，快點走罷，你的他一定是等得着急啦。］</p>
<p>［三姊，回家後你不要會會阿姜了？］</p>
<p>於是，對方就不好意思的反對了：　　［他？他可不急急等我回去，你家的他呀，他可是有那麽一點！］</p>
<p>［我　你的嘴，看你再説！］</p>
<p>她們雖把一身的精力，都消耗　工廠機器上，人到這時候全是疲　不堪的，　，她們之中仍然不缺乏談話，好像這談話對於她們反到可以减除或是忘去一些疲倦似的。</p>
<p>漸漸的，電車，吞蝕了大潮的一片，一角，時間漸漸的向前，浪平了，潮散了，砂礫，水沬，蟻羣都消滅在夜色之下了。</p>
<p>女茶房</p>
<h3>被［戀愛］忘却的少女</h3>
<p>— 玉侖</p>
<p>隔壁王二嫂的女兒銀姐，從前和我是天天見面的，近來則每星期頂多碰到她一次，而且一定是在星期六下午二至四時之間。據説，她現在已是個最摩登的女性，實行自食其力了。</p>
<p>她是在某大學當一名女茶房，住在學校整天的服待摩登丨但非最摩登的小姐們，但星期六下午二至四時，則有兩小時的假，原因是在那個時間以内，小姐們多數是不在學校裏面的。</p>
<p>上星期六日，她回家，而且來探訪我　　［你覺得辛苦嗎？］我問她。</p>
<p>［全不覺得！］她答，［我只覺到幸運：不過有時心裏也有點難過。］</p>
<p>［我不明白你的意思。］我説。</p>
<p>［那讓我來告訴你。但你不可告訴别人，尤其是我的母親！］她説。我允許了她，於是她就説下去了。</p>
<p>［在大學裏當茶房，無論食、住，或者收入，都比在工廠裏來得好。我工錢每月只四元，但我並不靠這些，我靠的是小姐們的恩惠。我服侍十個房間，每間房有四位小姐。每學期放假時，平均每人給四元，一共一百六十元，連同工錢計算在内，那等於每月有三十元的進帳。這在别人看來，雖並不算希奇，但在我却已是很滿意的了。而且工作也並不難，每天祇掃一次地，冲兩回開水，此外則替小姐們到飲食店裏去唤唤拮牛奶湯，麵包，土司等等，這些東西並不要我拿回，自然有夥計會送到的。］</p>
<p>［不過，］她繼續説，［我常常替小姐們遞情書。紅色或黃色的信都由我送到男生宿舍，遞到滿身西裝面孔漂亮的青年們手裏，而等他們的回信。這雖不是辛苦的事，但我想，同是一個女子，我爲什麽不能寫情書給人，也没有人寫給我？爲什麽要天天替他們傳遞消息？每晚睡下，想到這裏，心裏就不覺難過起來！］</p>

<p>一年一年又一年</p>
<p>一批一批又一批</p>
<p>我是南京人，現年二十一歳，女子師範畢業。曾任小學教員，後因病辭職。不久，因生活不能維持，乃入某樂器廠做上，説明三個月畢業後，可得三十元一月的薪水，並可按月增加。我抱着莫大的希望，過着這一日十時的堅苦生活。但事實總是給人失望的。現在已經四個多月了，不但不發薪水，連星期日的休假也被剥奪了。是可忍，孰不可忍丨我憤怒了丨大家都憤怒了！於是和廠方打交涉的戲幕便揭開了。我們的要求是促廠方履行規約，然而廠方究竟聰明，他给了一個三天答復的措手時間，又招了一批新的弱女子，便很從容的以　亂和閙風潮的名義，把我們開除了。於是我又失業了！唉！這是我的命運多　呢，還是社會的罪惡呢？</p>
<p>我能説上海方言，及純正國語，能修理口琴風琴等樂器。現願任小學教員，或店員，或會計，或校對，或護士等職。希望薪水三十元左右。若　聘用，請函投本刋轉文可也。</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting Outside the Passes</h3>
<p>Enemy Forces Fiercely Assaulting Xifengkou</p>
<p>Both Sides Adding Fresh Troops to the Front Lines</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xifengkou Telegram: The Japanese army attacking Xifengkou, from the morning of the 9th to the evening of the 10th, continued its fierce attacks.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Whereabouts Cause Suspicion</h3>
<p>Left Beiping Immediately After Issuing Resignation Telegram</p>
<p>One Story Says He Turned Back Midway While Flying to Shanghai</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Accepts Military Authority in North China</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is said that Zhang Xueliang was tired last night and flew to Shanghai this morning, but turned back to Beiping midway and decided to fly to Shanghai tomorrow morning. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's telegram stated: "To all comrades across the country, I, Zhang Xueliang, and my father have always taken the responsibility of maintaining China's sovereignty in the Northeast as our own. My father even died for it. Since I took office, I have always upheld my father's will and always took consolidating the central unified China as my duty. I have been diligent and never changed. Even the act of changing flags regardless of Japan's open intimidation, guiding the activities of the Kuomintang in the Northeast, and the fact that I entered the pass in the autumn of the Republic of China's 19th year under orders to support China's unification, all these facts are there. I deeply believe that only a sound government can resist foreign regrets. The September 18th Incident occurred when I was lying sick in Beiping. At first, I believed that appealing to the League of Nations would uphold justice. Now, when the Japanese army invaded Rehe, I was ordered to defend the territory and led the troops to deal with the enemy. Since the start of the fighting, there have been many officers and soldiers who have sacrificed their lives. Regardless of the success or failure of the matter, tens of thousands of subordinates have sacrificed for the country. Knowing that Chiang Kai-shek came north this time, after consultations, I felt more that my resignation today and my loyalty to the party and the country are the best ways to consolidate the center, so I resolutely resigned to apologize to the people of the country. I only miss the comrades in arms of many years, the brave soldiers of the Northeast, who are all national soldiers. In the 19th year, they were ordered to lead troops into the pass to assist the central government. Now that the national crisis has not ended, the homeland has not been recovered, and tens of thousands of people have nowhere to go. I only hope that the central government will look into their suffering and give them guidance, and also ask people from all walks of life to help them. They are all sincere for the country and their hometown, and they are familiar with the situation in the Northeast. If they encounter an opportunity to serve the country, they can be used to serve the recovery of the Northeast, so that they can fulfill their wishes and avoid wandering. It is enough to wish for this. I also hope that the people of the country will see my sincerity and understand my mediocrity. Although there are many mistakes, my original intention is only to serve the country, and I will not consider anything else. Zhang Xueliang kowtows." (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since Chiang Kai-shek met with Zhang Xueliang, He Yingqin, and others, the situation in North China has been refreshed. Chiang Kai-shek also telegraphed the results of the consultation to the Central Government. However, as of now, the Central Government's order has not yet arrived in Beiping. It is said that the Central Government believes that the current situation in North China is very serious and does not want to make too many changes. The Military Council still exists. Except for slight adjustments to senior officers within the organization, the rest will remain as they are. It is not accurate that the establishment of a military camp has been rumored. He Yingqin still presides over the affairs of the Military Council in his capacity as Minister of Military Administration, and does not receive any other titles. He can officially take office after receiving the order from the Central Government. When He went south to meet Chiang Kai-shek earlier, he asked Chiang Kai-shek for instructions on all military policies and unified command methods, and reorganized them. The various volunteer armies in the front are all responsible for the downsizing and redeployment by the Central Government, that is, the supply of supplies and other items, which will also be handled by the Beiping Military Council in the future, without resorting to any other institutions. The military response policy is determined by the Central Government's overall plan, which is handed over to He for execution, completely breaking the unified phenomenon from the past. He and Yang Jie and others discussed the above steps at Jurentang on the morning of the 11th. At noon, he met with Yu Xuezhong, Shao Wenkai, Bao Yulin, and others to discuss ways to consolidate the security of Tianjin and Beiping. (11th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang convened a meeting of his military and political leaders at the Shuncheng Wangfu last night, with the participation of Wan Fulin, Rong Zhen, Wang Shuchang, Tang Guozhen, Zhu Guangmu, Zhou Dawen, and Yu Xuezhong from Tianjin. Zhang reported on the meeting with Chiang Kai-shek and his desire to resign immediately. Wang Shuchang and others expressed their desire to retain him, otherwise they would be willing to advance and retreat together. Zhang persuaded everyone to obey the orders of the Central Government and continue to serve as usual, and then decided to comply with Zhang's training. Zhang then ordered someone to draft a telegram and ordered Wan and others to handle military and political affairs. After Yu Xuezhong met with Zhang, he returned to Tianjin this afternoon. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Zhang Xueliang flew to Shanghai this morning, he temporarily stayed at Song's residence to prepare to go abroad. He will go to Paris for a temporary stay in the future. From today, He Yingqin will effectively take on all military and political responsibilities in North China until the Central Government decides on a solution. At 9:00 this morning, Zhang sent Tang Guozhen to the offices of He Yingqin and Jiang Bocheng to inform them that Zhang had left Beiping. He immediately invited Jiang Bocheng, Yang Jie, Huang Shaoxiong, and others to discuss ways to handle everything in North China. At 10:00 this morning, He, Jiang, and Yang visited Wan to discuss the problems of the Northeast Army. (11th Dispatch)</p>

Wang Jingguo has a high voice as the chairman of Sui Province left behind. It is said that Huang Shaoxiong and Zhang Ji will be appointed, which is not accurate. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang Kai-shek is scheduled to publish a letter to the Northeast soldiers in Shijiazhuang in a few days to appease the Northeast soldiers. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When Zhang Xueliang issued his telegram of resignation this morning, he also sent telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek and military officers in various places, reporting on the process of his resignation. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang said to the generals last night that he had lost Rehe in ten days. What should he explain to the people of the country? We are not doing a good job, and we are not letting others do it, which is not right. Personally, I am sick and can't cope with difficult tasks. Chiang Kai-shek is thinking about the overall situation and is very kind to me. Your obedience to Mr. Chiang is obedience to me, etc. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin did not go to the Military Council today, but worked in Jurentang. Yang Jie has been internally appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Military Council. He and Yang will officially take office after the orders are announced. He and Yang summoned Ji Yiqiao and other councilors of the Military Council today to consult. Rong Zhen resigned as the Director of the Office of the Military Council. Chen Qinru is planned to be the Director of the Office of the Military Council. He Yingqin will go to the Military Council tomorrow morning to take office and will convene the group leaders of the association to talk tonight. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's whereabouts are unknown. According to well-informed Chinese sources, Zhang left Beiping this morning. Zhang's confidants said that Zhang is still in Beiping. He Yingqin apparently did not take over today and will do so tomorrow. However, it seems certain that Zhang Xueliang did not work today. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain close friend of Zhang Xueliang told Reuters that Zhang had indeed left Beiping for Shanghai at 8:00 this morning. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin addressed the group leaders of the Military Commission tonight, asking them to cooperate and assist him as they had assisted Zhang Xueliang in the past.

<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese sources, Yan Xishan arrived in Shijiazhuang this morning to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and will return to Taiyuan that night. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's whereabouts are still a mystery. His confidants said that Zhang left Beiping by plane with his secretary Li at 7:50 this morning. Before leaving, his face was calm, as if relieved of a burden. One of his Ford aircraft did fly over Beiping to the south at 8:00 this morning, but Zhang's confidant pilot is still in Beiping. It is claimed that two of Zhang's Ford aircraft are still at the airfield outside the city, but this has not been confirmed. The Shuncheng Wangfu was unusually quiet today. A Reuters reporter went to inquire there. People in the mansion said that Zhang had left Beiping in the morning, but Zhang has not yet arrived in Shanghai, or has gone to Hangzhou.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Prospect of the German Reactionary Regime</h3>
<p>Since Mussolini, with his so-called "Pan-Italianism," rose in Italy, he has been rampant domestically and has looked down on continental Europe for more than a decade. Following him is Hitler of Germany today. The so-called Pan-Italianism is, in academic terms, National Socialism. Hitler's National Socialist Party is named after this. This kind of doctrine is a monster that is neither a donkey nor a horse in academic theory. In fact, it is a deformed system in the transition between the old and new eras. This kind of deformed system has its temporary and occasional necessity under the special geographical relations of continental Europe. Therefore, regardless of whether it is neither a donkey nor a horse in theory, it still cannot but make a fleeting appearance in the long history of mankind.</p>
<p>Why do I say that? In Europe, there are many different races. The size of nations range from small to large, and they are intertwined with each other. Historically, racial struggles have been extremely frequent. Because of the constant looming of strong neighbors, the solidarity and self-help of the nation has become a necessity for survival. Therefore, the development of nationalism is greater than anywhere else in the world. In the past ten years or so, socialism, due to the success of the Russian Revolution, has been practiced from theory. The European continent, where the labor movement has always been developed, was shocked by it and eager to try it. Since modern nationalism regards capitalism as its soul, the achievement of socialism will naturally become a fatal injury to nationalism. Therefore, these Europeans, who are wandering at the crossroads, want to resist the trend of the times and keep socialism out of the door, which they cannot do. Abandoning nationalism and abolishing barriers is not allowed by national survival and historical concepts for a while. Therefore, they have to reconcile both ends, cater to all parties, and call for National Socialism. The doctrine itself is so contradictory. It is easy to see that it will eventually be unable to preserve itself. According to reality, it is still a deceptive social policy under nationalism, allowing capitalism to survive. It is almost a true statement to call it the last struggle of capitalism in its dying days.</p>
<p>What about the governance achievements of Italy's reactionary regime in the past ten years? Overproduction, unemployment, panic, all the contradictions of the economic system under capitalism, Italy has almost all of them. As a result of the expansion of productivity, the demand for opening up colonies is increasing. The evolution of capitalism into imperialism, prompted by Pan-Italianism, has accelerated its maturity. It is a widely recognized fact that Italy will be the main driving force for disrupting European peace. All kinds of cuts are enough to prove that Italy's Pan-Italianism is undoubtedly the remaining force of the old era, and it is by no means the prototype of the new era, which is the opposite of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>From the precedent of Italy's reactionary regime, it is not difficult to see the future of Germany. However, Mussolini was still lucky enough to encounter the times, so he can support it to this day. The day when the Italian reactionary regime began happened to be the time when productivity was declining after the war. In terms of the cycle rate, it is a stage from decline to prosperity. Therefore, all facilities can be promoted to the fullest extent. And after the war, Italy, on the one hand, used the afterglow of the victor to face Germany and Austria. Looking north at France, its strength was too greatly damaged and it was not its enemy either. Therefore, it was able to look down on continental Europe to fully satisfy the hypocritical demands of its followers' racial concepts. The solidarity within has been able to rely on it. If Hitler were to be appointed, he would be at the height of panic. If he wants to guide the people to production, the phenomenon of overproduction is becoming more and more serious. If he wants to guide his followers to destruction, he is contrary to the doctrine he has revealed. If he wants to satisfy the people's demands for expanding national power after oppression, France, with its powerful military, can kill him at any time. How dangerous is Hitler. If he eats his previous words and turns to silence, the result will be the second of Louis George MacDonald. If he wants to rise up to seek success, he will only be the vanguard of Italy's attack on France, taking the bad name of destroying European peace and gaining the status of Austria-Hungary's vassal during the last war. However, for Hitler, it is almost impossible to be better than these two. Alas, the reactionary regime of Germany.</p>
<p>The Japanese Arbitrarily Intimidate</p>
<p>Saying that they can take necessary actions at any time</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding China's concentration of troops in North China and Japan's request that the Beiping authorities withdraw the troops, the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Army said this morning that "the peace or war in North China is currently the biggest key." Japan has no intention of spreading the war to North China, but if Chiang Kai-shek decides to recover Rehe, Japan will dispatch troops to reinforce Beiping, Tianjin, Shanhaiguan, and other places. Regarding the issue of establishing a neutral zone, the spokesperson said that before the start of the hot war, the Japanese side suggested establishing a neutral zone inside and outside the Great Wall, but it was rejected by the Chinese side. Since the Japanese army has occupied all the areas north of the Great Wall, the current proposal will be to establish a neutral zone south of the Great Wall. The spokesperson finally said that if Chiang Kai-shek continues to concentrate troops in North China and clearly expresses his desire to counterattack Rehe, Japan must take necessary actions at any time to eliminate this intimidation. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Painfully Reduces Government Spending</h3>
<p>Saving 500 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Balance Revenue and Expenditure Within a Year</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 10th: US President Roosevelt sent a second message to Congress today, requesting an immediate and painful reduction in government spending, saying that if implemented, the government's finances can be expected to balance revenue and expenditure within a year. The message stated that Congress should quickly enact the Emergency Banking Act at the request of the government, which has pleased the whole country, but the government's finances are also in a similarly critical situation and urgently need the same frank and courageous action. In the past three years, the treasury lost 462,000,000 yuan in the 1931 fiscal year, 2,472,000,000 yuan in 1932, and is expected to lose 1,200,000,000 yuan by the end of this year. If expenditures continue to exceed revenues, the treasury's accumulated deficit will soon reach 50 billion yuan, so strict action must be taken to drastically cut government spending. This matter is sufficient to affect the national economy. The recent collapse of banks and the increasing economic depression are also major reasons. Although the previous Congress passed a bill to consolidate several administrative agencies, the savings were minimal and insufficient to meet the current urgent needs. Therefore, please Congress readopt a new bill to formulate broad principles for pensions and other benefits for veterans, and delegate the power to draft details to the executive branch. Please also Congress enact a new bill for the salaries of civil and military officials, abolish the holiday salary deduction plan, and replace it with general principles for salaries, so that the executive branch can make wise and fair adjustments. In short, the flexibility of this plan is not only for the sake of easy implementation, but also to follow the path of constitutional government. Please Congress implement it quickly. He can guarantee that after implementation, he can expect to balance revenue and expenditure within a year, etc. According to the Ministry of Finance's estimate, savings of 500 million yuan can be achieved according to the President's proposal.</p>

<h3>Is Gout Hereditary?</h3>
<p>If the Father Suffers, Will the Son Inherit?</p>
<p>Gout-Specific Spiritual Salts Can Prevent It</p>
<p>Many people worry about hereditary affliction because their father once suffered from gout. This is not entirely true. It is best to trust the experience of others to dispel this worry. Mr. Sun's father did suffer from gout, but he himself is now fifty-one years old. Although he does not completely abstain from alcohol, he has never shown any symptoms of gout. This is because he regularly takes Gout-Specific Spiritual Salts. He sent a letter to prove this. [My father suffered from gout for many years. In order to prevent it from happening to me, I take Gout-Specific Spiritual Salts every year without fail. In fact, this salt can be said to be a part of my breakfast. I am now fifty-one years old and have never suffered from rheumatism or bone pain, nor have I had any of its symptoms. I am not a complete teetotaler. I drink Shaoxing wine or small amounts of sorghum liquor from time to time.] | This humble one has another slightly different example to share. Mr. Hua suffered from constipation and felt gout symptoms in his body. He also recovered by taking Gout-Specific Spiritual Salts. His letter is as follows.</p>
<p>[In recent years, I have suffered from constipation and often suffer from excessive bile, causing diarrhea. I have also suffered from rheumatism and bone pain. My father and ancestors have all suffered from this type of gout. Two years ago, I started taking Gout-Specific Spiritual Salts. I take it according to the instructions every day, not too much. Now my constipation has been cured for more than a year. Although there are occasional signs of gout, I have been able to prevent them. Looking at the tips of my fingers, it seems that I cannot escape severe gout, but in terms of my personal health, I have not had any gout symptoms so far.] | Quiet</p>
<p>Gout is a very common disease. Scientific evidence shows that it is caused by unclean blood. Unclean blood is caused by poor excretion.</p>
<p>In short, it is caused by constipation. Whether mild or severe, it is enough to cause suffering. Gout-Specific Spiritual Salts have the function of preventing constipation, and their effect is very reliable.</p>

<h3>Earthquake and Tsunami in California, USA, Kill and Injure Thousands</h3>
<p>Carnegie Library Destroyed, Edison Power Plant Collapses</p>
<p>Safety of Former First Lady Unknown, Hollywood Stars Safe</p>
<p>Los Angeles, November 11 (Reuters) - Southern California was struck by a violent earthquake yesterday afternoon, causing thousands of deaths and injuries, and immense property damage. Coastal cities were also hit by a tsunami. Due to disrupted transportation, the true extent of the disaster area is unknown. The number of dead and injured is feared to be in the thousands. President Roosevelt, upon receiving news of the disaster, immediately ordered the government to expedite relief efforts. The earthquake began at 5:50 PM (Pacific Time), with the first tremor lasting several minutes. The tremors moved from north to south. In the following half hour, there were five more tremors, each separated by four to five minutes. Later, at 9:15 PM, two more major tremors occurred, the second of which was even more intense than the one in the afternoon. It is now believed that the epicenter of the earthquake was in Long Beach, formerly a popular summer resort, now a scene of carnage. The death toll is over five hundred. It is reported that 62,000 houses have been destroyed, and the remaining buildings are being consumed by fire. The US fleet has been dispatched to the area, and Marines have been sent ashore to assist in the rescue of disaster victims. The intensity of the tremors along the waterfront is unprecedented in the past ten years. Pasadena, Santa Barbara, Glendale, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Jacinto, San Pedro, and Hollywood all experienced equally violent earthquakes. In Los Angeles alone, at least 1,500 people have been injured. Authorities have called up retired soldiers to perform emergency duties, as vehicles transporting the injured are continuously streaming in and out, and fires are breaking out everywhere. In the town of Compton, houses have either been destroyed or severely damaged, with hardly any left intact. Twelve people have died. The Carnegie Library in San Pedro has also been destroyed, and several churches have been damaged. It is reported that the Edison Company power plant has collapsed, burying 200 workers inside. Furthermore, a portion of the Palos Verdes Hills near Redondo Beach has also collapsed.</p>
<h3>Another Violent Earthquake Strikes</h3>
<p>Japanese Have Experience</p>
<p>Taking Furniture, They Sleep on Foothills</p>
<p>Los Angeles, November 11 (Reuters) - At five minutes to one and eleven minutes past one this morning (Pacific Time), the sixteenth and seventeenth violent earthquakes occurred. Martial law has been declared in Long Beach. Residents are living in makeshift shelters amid the rubble. Ten thousand sailors from the US fleet are patrolling the entire town. Hospitals in Los Angeles have already admitted 6,000 injured, and approximately 700 new patients are being admitted every hour. One hundred Japanese people, having rich experience, knew that earthquakes are inevitably followed by tsunamis. At that time, they hurriedly fled from Terminal Island near Long Beach to the foothills with bedding and household goods, and are now sleeping there safely. Police authorities are now denying that Long Beach suffered a tsunami. According to a pilot who returned to Kansas City today, in a wireless message, he saw widespread fires in the Los Angeles area, and piles of bodies resembling disaster victims. Oil pools in disaster areas such as Los Angeles, San Pedro, Long Beach, and Wilmington, were ignited by the earthquake.</p>
<p>Additional dispatch - It is now known that twenty-four cities were affected by the earthquake, with a total of 120 deaths and 4,150 injuries. The homes of film stars in Hollywood and Beverly Hills sustained only minor damage, and no casualties have been reported. Former President Hoover's wife is currently in Los Angeles, and her safety is unknown. Hoover is currently trying to locate her.</p>
<p>Los Angeles, November 10 (National News Agency) - Southern California was suddenly hit by a severe earthquake tonight. The city of Long Beach has been reduced to rubble. Over one hundred people have died and more than one thousand five hundred have been injured. Transportation has been disrupted. Even in the commercial district of Los Angeles, there was immense panic. Three people died, and no less than two hundred people were injured by falling bricks and collapsing walls. The initial tremor occurred at 5:51 PM. It is said that there were a total of nine tremors. The most intense tremor affected areas as far south as San Diego and as far north as Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara was the worst affected area in the major earthquake of June 29, 1925. Long Beach has some of the most exquisite residences on the west coast of the United States along the beach. However, its commercial district consists mainly of lower buildings. According to initial reports, Pine Avenue, the most prosperous street in the area, has been reduced to rubble. This is because when shops and residential houses were built, little special attention was paid to earthquake resistance. Therefore, in the event of a severe earthquake, they easily collapse, burying the people inside alive. Currently, all parties are actively raising funds for relief.</p>
<h3>US Federal Reserve Banks Reopen</h3>
<p>Sound Banks Can Also Recover</p>
<p>Public Confidence Has Been Restored</p>
<p>Washington, November 10 (National News Agency) - The US President today issued an executive order transferring all management of banking affairs to the Treasury Department. After receiving the order, Treasury Secretary Woodin immediately stated that the twelve Federal Reserve Banks will reopen on Saturday and will be authorized to lend money directly secured by government debt. After the reopening of the Reserve Banks, member banks under the reserve system will be able to resume full operations in accordance with the government's emergency regulations. However, as Saturday is only a half-day business day, it is feared that not many banks will be able to open. It is expected that by the beginning of next week, all parts of the country will have banks that have resumed operations. Furthermore, with the exception of the prohibition of gold and foreign exchange transactions, other businesses will not be restricted. However, member banks wishing to resume operations must apply to the Treasury Department for a federal government business license. The Treasury Department will not issue a license unless it is certain that the bank has sufficient solvency. The new currency to alleviate the money shortage will be issued by the Federal Reserve Banks to member banks starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>New York, November 10 (National News Agency) - The New York Federal Reserve Bank reported today that public confidence in banks has greatly recovered. In the past four days, a total of $65 million has been re-deposited into New York banks, of which $30 million was deposited in the last 24 hours. The number of gold coins and gold certificates re-deposited in banks today has been endless. Financiers predict that after the complete reopening of banks, the number of people who return gold to banks will be even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Washington, November 10 (Reuters) - President Roosevelt today signed an order authorizing Treasury Secretary Woodin to grant licenses to Federal Reserve System member banks that are found to be sound, allowing them to resume operations. However, the gold ban is still strictly enforced. State banks that are not members of this system must obtain permission from the state banking authorities before they can reopen. Treasury Secretary Woodin declared that the twelve central Federal Reserve Banks will reopen for business tomorrow. Secretary of State Hull stated that once the domestic banking difficulties are resolved, the US government will begin diplomatic talks with various countries to lay the foundation for a successful world economic and financial conference.</p>
<p>Washington, November 10 (Reuters) - After his victory yesterday, President Roosevelt continued his attack on the payment of veterans' benefits in his economic proposals. The proposal was submitted to the Senate today, requesting Congress to immediately reduce this expenditure, as the recipients are not completely incapacitated and are not always accountable. Although the President did not explain the details, semi-official estimates indicate that $300,000,000 per year could be saved. President Roosevelt also asked Congress to allow him to reduce the salaries of government employees, up to a maximum of 15 percent, which would save a total of 450,000,000 yuan per year. The fiscal deficit for the fiscal year 1933 is expected to exceed $1,200,000,000 (excluding the loans from the Financial Restructuring Corporation). If no action is taken immediately, the deficit for 1934 will be around $1,000,000,000. Furthermore, several hundred million yuan of short-term government bonds must be repaid in the spring, so reform is urgently needed.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Conference Reaches Understanding</h3>
<p>MacDonald Arrives in Geneva, Daladier to Follow Soon</p>
<p>Franco-German Compromise Remains Key to Success or Failure of Disarmament</p>
<p>Geneva, November 11 (National News Agency) - British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, and French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour all arrived here this morning. After MacDonald's arrival, he held talks with Italian representative Aloisi, Disarmament Conference Vice-Chairman Politis, Chairman Henderson, and US representative Gibson, in succession. The security was tight, and the content is unknown. Paris, November 10 (Havas) - British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, French Prime Minister Daladier, and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour began discussing issues at 10:20 this morning. They took a short break at noon and were hosted a banquet by Daladier. The talks continued at 3:00 PM and ended at 3:45 PM. The British and French representatives focused on all issues concerning Geneva in the morning. The afternoon meeting was devoted to drafting a formal communique, which reads as follows: [British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon, en route to Geneva, stopped in Paris and stayed at the British Embassy in France last night. They were fortunate to meet with Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour this morning. The British and French representatives exchanged views on all important issues of economic and political concern to the people. They all agreed that the situation at the Geneva Disarmament Conference is urgent, especially the situation in Europe. They decided to consult with representatives of other countries in various ways and reach a compromise to ensure world peace.] MacDonald and Simon returned directly to the British Embassy after leaving the Ministry of War and are scheduled to depart for Geneva at 9:40 tonight. Before their departure, the British and French dignitaries will not meet again. Prime Minister Daladier had originally decided to postpone his trip to Geneva but, at the request of British cabinet members, plans to depart early next week.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Views</h3>
<p>London, November 10 (Havas) - The communique issued by the British and French cabinet members after their meeting in Paris has been commented on by political figures here, who said that [the cabinet members of the two countries have decided to consult with representatives of other countries in various ways and reach a compromise to ensure world peace.] should be interpreted as Prime Minister MacDonald's desire to reach a compromise between France and Germany. The basis is the British proposal in Geneva [not to resort to force - a layer], and starting from this basis, a more complete agreement can be reached. It seems that in this way, the obstacles to the Disarmament Conference, which some people believe to have been encountered, can continue to proceed.</p>
<p>Paris, November 10 (Havas) - During the talks between the British and French cabinet members, special attention was paid to Germany's political orientation and its will to rearm. British and French officials believe that Germany's move to incorporate the Steel Helmet League and the National Socialist Storm Troopers into the police force violates the Treaty of Versailles. The proposal to reopen the European-American Five-Power Conference (i.e., Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and the United States) on disarmament issues seems to have been temporarily shelved. Negotiations on the issue of mutual debts between countries will continue when the US finances are stable. At that time, the British and French governments will inform each other of the progress of the negotiations. It is reported that the British and French governments, in order to maintain peace, are in agreement on various issues.</p>
<h3>German Sentiments</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11 (National News Agency) - The French semi-official news agency's publication of a statement regarding the Franco-British talks clearly expresses France's views. The German political circles have had a painful impression after reading it. The statement that Germany has decided to rearm is particularly absurd. The reason for this is probably to undermine Germany's attempt to seek equal treatment. The statement also points out that Germany's incorporation of the Steel Helmet League and the National Socialist Storm Troopers into the police force violates the Treaty of Versailles. In short, this is purely a misunderstanding. The use of these groups as auxiliary police forces in the current unstable political situation is a temporary expedient and cannot be immediately regarded as a violation of the treaty. Berlin, November 11 (National News Agency) - British and French people here have openly expressed disappointment that Germany has not sent important cabinet members to Geneva to reopen the Five-Power talks. It is rumored that MacDonald may meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini near the Swiss border, within Italian territory.</p>
<h3>US Attention</h3>
<p>Washington, November 11 (Reuters) - It is reported that President Roosevelt consulted with Secretary of State Hull and Davis, the US representative who attended last year's Disarmament Conference, last night. The discussions were mainly about the situation in the Far East and Germany. US officials believe that the success or failure of world disarmament is gradually being revealed. Germany's expression of restoring its military strength and Japan's increasing military strength have caused concern among US officials. It is also reported that the Roosevelt administration holds the attitude that if other countries do not reduce their armaments but instead increase them, then the United States will only have to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Italian Statement</h3>
<p>Rome, November 10 (Havas) - The Fascist Party's cadre conference was held last night, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini. The Prime Minister declared that the goal of Italian politics is not to disturb world peace, and to assist in the political, economic, and spiritual transformation of Europe. He also stated that if the Disarmament Conference abandons Italy's concrete proposals, it will not achieve positive results. The Prime Minister urged the blackshirts throughout Italy to strive for the strength of the nation and to spread Fascism throughout the world.</p>
<h3>Geneva Signs</h3>
<p>Geneva, November 10 (Reuters) - The future of the Disarmament Conference is so dark, and the atmosphere of agreement is so hopeless, as never before. Yet British Prime Minister MacDonald is about to arrive in Geneva at this time. Any important event in disarmament sees a complete stalemate in the opinions between France and Germany. Neither side has shown any sign of making concessions. Germany believes that since Germany has already disarmed, it is not responsible. What it demands is equality, whether in armaments or disarmament. France, on the other hand, says that the extent of France's disarmament must be governed by the extent of security France obtains. The conflict of views between the two sides is evident in every issue in the General Assembly, regardless of whether it is discussing troop strength, armaments, air force, or the abolition of war. What makes the British Prime Minister's work even more difficult is the absence of key officials from Germany, France, and Italy. Germany is unwilling to send Deputy Prime Minister Papen or Foreign Minister Neurath to attend until it has received a concrete proposal. French Prime Minister Daladier is also unwilling to risk being surrounded by a coalition of Britain, the United States, and Italy in Geneva. Although Italy has expressed extremely sympathetic attention, it has not explicitly declared its support for Germany's determination. However, the recent resolution of the Fascist Party's Supreme Council has confirmed Italy's position. At the same time, a noteworthy rapprochement between Poland and Soviet Russia is now evident. This matter has also led to a closer understanding between France and Russia, which has been facilitated by German Chancellor Hitler's anti-communist actions. Looking at the various situations mentioned above, the British Prime Minister wants to obtain an agreement of some form, or supplemented by an armistice. However, even this method will inevitably be strongly opposed by Germany, so the future is extremely bleak.</p>
<h3>Definition of Aggression</h3>
<p>Geneva, November 10 (Reuters) - The Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference met this afternoon to discuss Russia's proposal to define the term "aggressor nation." Russian representative Dovgalevsky said that only complete disarmament can guarantee security. However, since Russia's proposal to achieve this goal has not been supported, he believes that it is necessary to define a strict method so that it can naturally determine who is the aggressor nation. Chinese representative Dr. Lo Chung-yi said that the issue of the application of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant should also be studied. The current situation in the Far East proves the importance of this issue. He expressed agreement with the Russian plan. He deeply regretted that there was no way to solve the difficult problem of undeclared war. If there was such a solution, China would not suffer as it does today. Several speakers supported the Russian proposal, but France gave it limited agreement. British representative Eden and US representative Whitehouse expressed doubts about whether such a strict definition of aggressor nation could be implemented or whether it would be beneficial. Japanese representative Yada said that the definition of the term "aggressor nation" will often involve difficult investigations related to various problems that must be taken into account and disputed. He advocated seeking a fair method that focuses on practicalities. After repeated discussions, the Political Committee assigned a drafting committee to draft articles for continued discussion.</p>
<h3>The Strategic Significance of the US Naval Grand Maneuvers in the Eyes of the Japanese (Continuation 2)</h3>
<p>(Ito Masanori)</p>
<p>13. Air Control Warfare</p>
<p>First, the United States is unique. Rather than saying "unique," it would be more appropriate to say that it is the best in the world. The tactics of joint sea-air operations, whether in attack or defense, have been fully demonstrated.</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy, which is not inferior to the great powers in various combat skills, regrettably is one step behind in [new sea-land joint tactics]. The United States' new tactical thinking believes that air control during the decisive battle of the main forces is a condition for victory. Therefore, it does not care about the hundreds of old destroyers and allows them to remain idle on the shore. Most of the submarines are also left as they are. Only the cruisers will be increased to the number of formations in the near future. However, the strengthening of the air force is more active than anything else. The German proposal of 1,000 aircraft (five-year plan) with 170 million yuan has been completed as scheduled. In addition to the *Saratoga* and *Lexington* aircraft carriers, a new ship [*Ranger*] (13,800 tons, 76 aircraft) will soon be completed, and the expansion of aircraft carriers will continue actively.</p>
<p>In future naval battles, air attacks will be like artillery battles in the army, and main gun battles will be like infantry clashes in the army. In other words, the prerequisite for infantry decisive battles in the army is the shelling of positions, which is the same as the activity of the air force at sea.</p>
<p>In a war, the US sea and air forces take a rapid offensive and sweep the enemy from the air to gain air control. Then, the enemy ships' aircraft cannot measure the range of artillery shells. In long-range battles more than 30,000 yards apart, it is like a blind man firing a gun. Even if it fires a hundred times, it will not hit once. On the other hand, US aircraft can not only safely engage in observation, but also use bombers to bomb from the air, as freely as if they were firing torpedoes from the water surface, demonstrating their superiority.</p>
<p>For example, when Army A and Army B fight a naval battle, Army A has no aviation aircraft, while only Army B has it. The result of the war is of course obvious at a glance.</p>
<p>The US Navy will first devote all its efforts to air combat, aiming to completely wipe out the enemy aircraft. Then, a few hours later, it will be able to have the same confidence as Army B above and conduct its absolutely superior battle. Currently, there are 236 fighter planes, 378 bombers, 148 reconnaissance planes (with light bombing capabilities), 132 search planes, and 106 auxiliary planes (training), totaling 1,000 planes. Each type is sophisticated and excellent, and its operational technology is also among the best in the world.</p>
<p>14. Another Stage of the Air Force</p>
<p>In addition, the United States suddenly proposed the new condition of "aviation cruiser" at the London Conference. After a brief dispute, it was passed. This condition is nothing more than supplementing the lack of aircraft for air control operations.</p>
<p>The above is the United States' other plan for the air force. Now, looking at this exercise, the attacking army in Hawaii and the invading army attacking the US mainland are formed by aircraft carrier battle groups and large cruiser battle groups. As mentioned before, their ambition lies in exerting the massive power of aviation warfare. The formation of this team can be seen more accurately as the US Navy's so-called Larger Carter Group large aircraft carrier group. The so-called "aviation cruiser" mentioned above is to make it a Lesser Carrier Group.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the United States will summarize the results of this exercise into the issue of enriching aircraft carriers. After the new aircraft carrier *Ranger* is completed, a total of 92,500 tons and 280 aircraft are still not enough. By actively promoting this, based on the experience of this exercise, within the limits of the Washington Treaty's [quantity], it will definitely establish a policy of actively building aircraft carriers. After the *Langley* (12,700 tons) was abandoned, the US construction surplus capacity increased from 42,500 tons to 55,200 tons. Three 18,000-ton ships can be built, and 300 more aircraft must be prepared.</p>
<p>In this way, the Navy believes that 1,000 aircraft is not enough. 512 aircraft are used for the fleet, and 488 aircraft are used on land and as reserves. By 1936, when the naval treaty expires, the number of aircraft used by the fleet will be expanded to about 800, and 200 aircraft will be added when aviation cruisers are prepared in the near future. Only the number of standing aircraft used by the fleet can reach 1,000. It goes without saying that these 1,000 aircraft can be fully mobilized under an offensive strategy to win air control in a decisive naval battle.</p>
<p>15. Conclusion</p>
<p>But how is the Japanese Navy preparing for aviation warfare? Those who lag behind in the air force will also lag behind in the navy. It goes without saying that maritime warriors cannot match the air.</p>
<p>The military department, which has gained a lot of experience in the air force in Manchuria and Shanghai, how much of the 820 million yuan budget for the army and navy has been invested in the air force? The author does not want to pursue this matter, but only uses this article to urge the attention of the people of the country and the authorities. If the air is controlled, Japan's submarines will inevitably be searched and exploded by the enemy's air force as freely as in a game. Isn't the most important combat skill of the aircraft carrier group in the current exercise of offensive and defensive battles in Hawaii to freely drop bombs on the defending submarines (because the submarines are all enemies)!</p>
<p>Finally, another important issue in the conclusion of the exercise is the issue of strengthening military strength that has been promoted to the people.</p>
<p>The US Congress is famous for not easily approving naval construction. Naturally, the driving force of the people is strong. In addition to actively assisting the three-year plan of 1916, it usually only talks about reducing shipbuilding costs to maintain its traditional nature. Here, I will try to compare the warships that Japan and the United States have not built within the [quantity] stipulated in the London Treaty.</p>
<p>Ship type United States Japan</p>
<p>Aircraft carrier 43,700 12,130</p>
<p>Light cruiser 73,000 /</p>
<p>Destroyer 131,000 9,205</p>
<p>Submarine 25,630 /</p>
<p>Japan has at least surplus capacity while fully developing. The United States has a surplus capacity of 270,000 tons.</p>
<p>Indeed, the US Navy Department submitted a plan for strengthening to the Senate Naval Committee on January 27. According to this proposal, 135 ships can be built by 1936.</p>
<p>320,000 tons, including 3 aircraft carriers / 55,200 tons, 9 cruisers 87,100 tons, 89 destroyers / 133,500 tons, and 34 submarines / 40,700 tons.</p>
<p>(Note: The difference from the previous table is because the construction volume at the start and the construction volume at the completion are different. The difference in aircraft carriers is because Admiral Osumi included the *Langley* and *Greely* in the calculation. The United States has now abandoned this ship and replaced it with other plans, so it is feared that this difference will arise from here.)</p>
<p>1936 is the year the naval treaty expires. At that time, the strategic necessity and diplomatic necessity of the amount of standing troops will inevitably become tense. Its advantages and disadvantages are naturally another issue, and the idea of [maintaining strength] is an overwhelming fact that dominates the world's navies. The greatest purpose of the US naval grand maneuvers is also in this. (The End)</p>

<h3>The Wan Fulin Brigade's Battle Against Japan in Rehe:</h3>
<p>Talks with Chief of Staff Wang Jing Upon His Return to Beiping</p>
<p>The Generals and Soldiers Have a Glorious History of Resisting Russia</p>
<p>They Were Determined to Die on the Battlefield Before Setting Out</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Wang Jingru, Chief of Staff of the 53rd Army of the 4th Army Group, Wan Fulin's brigade, arrived in Beiping on a mission from Mr. Wan to discuss important matters. Yesterday (the 8th) afternoon, Mr. Wang discussed the course of the battle with Wan Fulin as follows:</p>
<p>"[I followed Commander-in-Chief Wan and departed from Beiping on February 27th. On that day, in the Lingyuan area, Yu Zhaolin's division had already made contact with the enemy, and the fighting was extremely fierce. On the evening of the 28th, we arrived in Pingquan, and after briefly arranging the affairs of the General Headquarters, the next morning (March 1st), Commander-in-Chief Wan immediately went to the Lingyuan front line for inspection. He personally instructed Division Commander Yu Zhaolin that Lingyuan was an extremely important eastern town, and its gain or loss was of great importance to the war situation. No matter what sacrifices were necessary, it must be defended to the death. Just as he was about to continue inspecting the battle conditions of the Sun and Ding divisions in the Dachengzi and Lingnan areas, he received intelligence that the situation in that area had changed. He immediately turned back to inspect the Thirty Family Village positions and gave a speech to the officers and soldiers of Wang Yongsheng's division there, saying: 'We soldiers are supported by the state in peacetime. Now that we have finally obtained an opportunity to fight the enemy, it is time for us to repay the country. Everyone should fight to the death and not be timid at all. The ancients considered dying on the battlefield to be an honor, especially for your division. You were originally the old troops of Liang Zhongjia's 15th Brigade and the 130th Division, and the old troops of Han Guangdi's 17th Brigade. In the 1929 anti-Russian campaign, you won a glorious history. All officers and soldiers must maintain this glory and fight forward together. If one person retreats, it will be a disgrace to the entire unit, not only failing to live up to the country but also failing to live up to the martyrs. This Commander-in-Chief will only enforce military law and will never be lenient.' That evening, he returned to Pingquan and received a telegram from Sun and Ding, the two division commanders, from Shanzuizi, briefly stating that they had been engaged in fierce fighting with a superior enemy in recent days. On the Lingnan front, the right wing of Ding's division had been surrounded, and the enemy had broken through Lingnan with more than sixty armored vehicles, directly attacking Lingyuan, cutting off communication between the division headquarters and the front line. They were currently engaged in mixed warfare, and the situation was unclear, and they requested instructions on how to proceed. At this time, Shen Ke's division was advancing towards the Yaolugou and Foye Cave line, and Miao's division was fighting the enemy north of Lama Cave and Shuiquan. Commander-in-Chief Wan then decided to order Yu's division to launch a full-scale attack, and the two division commanders Sun and Ding led the directly subordinate companies and a newly reorganized unit to immediately counterattack and restore the original positions. He also ordered Shen's division to cooperate with Miao's division and Ding's division to properly establish contact and attack Lingnan as an opportunity to threaten the enemy's left flank. At dawn on the 2nd, the full-scale fierce battle resumed and gradually became serious. Commander-in-Chief Wan went back and forth to supervise the battle without stopping for a moment. The casualties on both sides piled up like mountains. That afternoon, the fierce battle in Yebaishou had lasted for three days and nights. The front line was shaking, and Yu's subordinate Fan Regiment was wiped out, and Regiment Commander Fan was seriously injured. At the same time, the Lingyuan position was attacked from both the left and right, and the situation was very critical. Yu's division suffered almost all casualties. Wan then urgently transferred two regiments from Wang Yongsheng's division to reinforce them. The enemy then launched a fierce bombing with more than a dozen airplanes and more than twenty armored vehicles and automobiles, and they retreated to the Thirty Family Village defense line. At this time, Lingyuan was surrounded, and street fighting broke out. Division Commander Yu, unable to withstand the enemy with his small number of troops and suffering too many casualties, led only the special technology company to break through the encirclement and gradually withdraw to the Thirty Family Village, reorganizing the remaining troops. At noon on the 3rd, Wang's division, together with the remaining troops of Yu's division, launched a fierce counterattack, and the front line had approached Lingyuan. Suddenly, a surrendered Rehe officer, Shao Benliang, guided the enemy (Shao had been stationed in Lingyuan, Pingquan, Kuancheng, and other places and was very familiar with the local situation), leading the enemy forces directly to our Thirty Family Village position through the mountain gullies, cutting off our retreat. Commander-in-Chief Wan led his troops back in a hurry, and the enemy again rushed out of Lingyuan with more than sixty armored vehicles, directly attacking the front. The Thirty Family Village position was lost, and they gradually retreated to Pingquan, and then added the Pingquan garrison battalion to defend the key points and resist the war with great strength. On the 4th, Chengde fell, and our army's rear felt even more threatened. The headquarters then retreated to Kuancheng in order to maintain contact with the two divisions of Shen and Miao. Commander-in-Chief Wan was still supervising the battle in the front. In the two battles of Pingquan and Xiaosigou, two guards were killed in battle, and several were injured. The cavalry company commander of Dai's staff guard went missing, and the casualties were particularly heavy. The horse of the commander-in-chief was also shot down. Currently, Kuancheng has built a solid position, but the situation is critical and unexpected. In short, in this battle, our army's equipment and various facilities are far inferior to those of the enemy. The residents have suffered from Tang's tyrannical rule, and their resentment is too deep, and they have the slogan of [I would rather be a slave to a conquered country than a citizen of Rehe under Tang]. When our army entered Rehe, the residents thought that they were helping Tang and hindered them everywhere. The enemy not only had traitors as guides but also had airplanes to scout, and they often took advantage of our gaps to break through the front line with armored vehicles and bombed to cover their advance. Our army's defense was very difficult. Although outer trenches were built at each position, the enemy's armored vehicles all carried iron plates, and when there were outer trenches, they would lay the iron plates on them and rush over directly. Most of the previous defeats were due to this." (March 9)</p>
<h3>Weng Zhaoyuan Immediately Leads His Troops to the Front Line</h3>
<p>Moves His Troops to Beiping After Taking Office in Baoding</p>
<p>Beiping Organizations Warmly Welcome Him</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Weng Zhaoyuan, a famous general in the Battle of Shanghai, went to Southeast Asia to conduct patriotic propaganda among overseas Chinese, achieving remarkable results. Upon receiving news of the loss of Yu Pass, he immediately returned to China and resolutely went north, intending to go to the Rehe front to assist the generals in resisting the invaders. Director Zhang of Beiping, because of Weng's remarkable achievements in resisting Japan in Shanghai and his precise artillery fire, intended to give him an important task. Just then, the Beiping Military Branch appointed him as the commander of the 117th Division of the Army. Mr. Weng gladly accepted and decided to take office in Baoding as soon as possible to organize his troops and intensify training in preparation for an early departure to the front. According to reports a few days ago, Weng Zhaoyuan had already supervised the division on the front line, which was probably a misunderstanding. At 2:00 p.m. on the 4th, Mr. Weng arrived in Baoding from Beiping. Few people knew about it in advance. When the train arrived at Gaobeidian, the news was transmitted by the transportation department, and military and political leaders rushed to the station to welcome him. There were more than thirty people, including former Division Commander Huang Shiyue, Public Security Bureau Chief Yu Xifan, County Chief Jin Liang, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Li Yongzhen, and the Public Security Bureau Security Team Military Band, the 117th Division Guard Company, etc. When the passenger car arrived at the station, Mr. Weng got off the train in the melodious and tragic military music. After exchanging a few words of greeting with the welcomers, he boarded the car and entered the city. At that time, all the citizens knew about it, and the roads were blocked. Onlookers were like walls, vying to see the demeanor of this national hero, cheering and dancing wildly. The tragic and enthusiastic emotions were unprecedented. Mr. Weng had no servants, only Adjutant Zhang Xuewen accompanied him. He stayed at the Tianxiang Hotel. After a short rest, he rode a horse to the Nanguan Airport for inspection. He then went to former Division Commander Huang's banquet and met with reporters, making the following remarks: "After the Battle of Shanghai, I (Weng Zhaoyuan said himself) went to Southeast Asia to conduct patriotic propaganda and raised a considerable amount of money to purchase airplanes. The patriotism of the overseas Chinese is as enthusiastic as madness. They are generous and admirable. This time I went north, not to be an official, but to kill thieves. Even if I am not a division commander, I will still rush to the Rehe border with one man and one horse to fight the Japanese invaders. I was also appointed by a clear order as the commander-in-chief of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Army, and I will organize the existing volunteer army as the basic team. In the near future, I will swear to go north, sacrifice my head, and return my rivers and mountains. It is also a pleasure to gallop with the Japanese devils in the black waters and white mountains. The quality of the weaponry is irrelevant to victory or defeat. As long as everyone is of one mind and morale is boosted, even stones and wooden sticks are enough to kill the enemy. I gained considerable experience in the Battle of Shanghai, that is, military-civilian cooperation will surely lead to victory. The national situation is so critical that all prejudices can be discarded and unite to face the outside world. The military, the people, and the masses should be aware of their responsibilities as soon as possible. However, soldiers die before the people, and the masses must have a desperate spirit and be a strong backing. Therefore, all localities should quickly organize mass organizations and intensify military training to enhance the strength of the masses. The media should do their best to promote the patriotic movement."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, Mr. Weng held a swearing-in ceremony in Baoding. At the same time, he handled the handover matters with Division Commander Huang, and issued an inauguration telegram, saying: "I have received an appointment order from the Military Council of the National Government's Beiping Branch, appointing Weng Zhaoyuan as the commander of the 117th Division of the Army, etc. I will take office in Baoding on the 5th and depart for the front in the near future. Zhaoyuan has been in the military for 20 years and has devoted himself to the country. He has long cherished the heart of Fubo to die on the battlefield and buried his bones in the sand. Now, when the national crisis is in full swing, it is time to take up arms and resist the invaders. I am extremely grateful for the favor bestowed upon me. From now on, I will rectify the army, boost morale, drive away the jackals and tigers, and return my rivers and mountains. I am shocked by the territory of Yu, and I dare not resign from the insignificant labor of a hundred battles. I will crack my eyes and support Fusang and swear to vent the global public anger. Zhaoyuan will lead the way with a crossbow and will not turn back. I respectfully report this by telegram and wait for instructions." Mr. Weng also said that the division stationed in Baoding is extremely compatible with the people. Because the departure to fight against Japan is imminent, he convened a general meeting of all the people that day, with more than 40,000 people attending. Mr. Weng gave a speech on the spot, which was unusually impassioned and full of determination. He also explained that 180 large vehicles were needed before departure, and the people were also full of anti-Japanese sentiment, so they automatically donated on the spot. On the 7th, Mr. Weng, believing that his troops must immediately go to the front line to resist the Japanese invaders, especially came to Beiping with Wu Keren, the deputy division commander of the division, and more than a dozen attendants to ask for instructions. After arriving in Beiping, all national salvation organizations received the news and immediately publicly elected representatives from more than thirty organizations, including university professors, the Anti-Japanese Association, the Women's Youth Society, the Oriental Public Opinion Society, and the National Soul Society, and carried banners and welcome flags to the division headquarters in Nanyuan to express their welcome. It happened that Mr. Weng had entered the city for official business and had not returned, so the adjutant of the division received him. Because Weng was out, the representatives hung slogans such as [Welcome all the anti-Japanese soldiers of the 117th Division to kill the enemy] and [Welcome the famous General Weng to lead his troops to kill the enemy] at the door of the division headquarters and returned to the city by car. According to the division's news, a certain regiment of the division had arrived in Nanyuan, and the rest of the troops had been departing north since the evening of the 8th. However, when they would go to the front line was still awaiting orders. (9th)</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Yesterday, General Weng Zhaoyuan came to Baoding to take over as commander of the 117th Division. Merchants and civilians throughout the city hung flags and lanterns and cheered like crazy. The Provincial College Federation initiated a meeting to welcome General Weng and raised donations to comfort the departing soldiers, dividing into five teams to start work. In half a day, enthusiastic slogans spread throughout the city. It happened that the former division commander, Huang Shiyue, left Baoding six days ago and led a regiment to Beiping first. About 10,000 people from various schools, agencies, organizations, and shops gathered at the station to send him off. The 2,200-plus comfort items purchased by the College Federation were also delivered to the soldiers going to Beiping at the same time. At noon that day, the troop train entered the station. The soldiers held flags and shouted slogans such as "Military-Civilian Union" and "Capture Japanese Bandits Alive". The people also waved flags and shouted the slogans "[Farewell to the Anti-Japanese Soldiers] and "Long Live the Republic of China" in response. Division Commander Huang then delivered a farewell speech, followed by General Weng's address to the soldiers, which was extremely angry. The troop train then slowly departed north. At 2 p.m., the people gathered again in Nanguan Park to hold a meeting to welcome General Weng. The meeting was held at 3 p.m., presided over by Dr. Ma Futing, the president of the Medical College, who gave a simple and passionate opening speech and expressed his sincere welcome on behalf of all circles. Tens of thousands of people at the scene felt the seriousness of the situation, and the atmosphere was very tense. When General Weng took the stage, cheers were thunderous, and tens of thousands of heads were raised in admiration. The spirit of the whole scene was concentrated on him. The general was tall and dignified, and at a glance, it could be seen that there was a sense of integrity in his chest. His speech briefly stated: "This time I went north only to swear to avenge the national feud and recover the lost land. If we win, we will succeed, and if we lose, we will become martyrs. Dying on the front line is the duty of a soldier, and the support of the people in the rear is especially important. The victory in Shanghai was not the merit of the 19th Route Army, but the result of the strength of the people. Whether this time to resist Japan can succeed or not depends on the efforts of the people of North China. Therefore, what is hoped of the people is one to help the departing anti-Japanese soldiers and the other is to eradicate the traitors who take the opportunity to make trouble in the rear." Finally, the audience shouted slogans such as "Military and civilian unite as one", "Support the anti-Japanese pioneer General Weng", "Support the anti-Japanese soldiers", and "Long live the Republic of China" and dispersed.

<h3>Guangdong Province Manufactures Smoke Screens</h3>
<p>Excellent Results in Trial Release</p>
<p>Several Colors and Varieties</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Industrial Research Institute of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction has recently researched and manufactured a type of smoke screen, a weapon against war. It has recently been successfully manufactured and was released on a trial basis at the foot of Guanyin Mountain in northern Guangzhou City on the 5th. People from all walks of life went to visit. That day, Chen Yaodian, the director of the institute, accompanied by all the technicians of the institute, arrived at the venue for the trial. First, the director explained the process of the trial production of the smoke screen. Unfortunately, some of the raw materials were imported. The raw materials currently produced are worth more than 90 yuan per 100 pounds. The manufactured smoke screen has ten square and rectangular shapes, large and small. The square, large-sized ones have a raw material capacity of 10 pounds each, and the small ones have a capacity of 5 pounds. When ignited, a wisp of white smoke shoots straight into the sky. When it reaches the sky, it spreads and fills the air like a thick fog, and you cannot see your fingers. The smoke is more than a thousand feet high and covers a distance of two li. It took 64 minutes to disperse. The trial result was very satisfactory. According to Gao Lude, a technician at the institute, the smoke screen has been researched by colleagues at the institute for one month and ten days. At first, there were no books with detailed descriptions of the manufacturing method, and the descriptions in ordinary books were brief and vague and impractical. Because smoke screens are military supplies, countries mostly keep the manufacturing methods secret. Later, the researchers tried many ways and, based on the principles of industry, mixed several solid, liquid, and impurities. After burning, they first vaporized them, rose into the sky, condensed after chemical action, and then descended, using the opportunity for chemical action in the sky to spread widely and assist military operations. Today's trial release is a type of white smoke screen. According to Director Chen, this smoke screen has been researched by technicians at the institute in groups for several months before it was successful. There are many colors and varieties, but the white color has the greatest covering power. In addition, there are yellow, blue, black, and purple pigments. The usage is generally based on the color of the morning, dusk, land, and sea, and the appropriate color screen is applied to achieve the effect of concealment and seduction in combat. Colored smoke screens can also be used for communication signals. The distribution and release depend on the military's adaptation to circumstances. The smoke screens currently researched and manufactured by the institute include two types of white, and one type each of yellow and purple. The white smoke screen released today produces the densest smoke, and the smoke also has no toxic substances. (March 6)</p>
<h3>The Jiangxi Bandit Suppression Army Captures Huangpi</h3>
<p>Fierce Battles in Huoyuan Break Through Bandit Positions</p>
<p>Three Armies Meet in Huangpi to Advance on Luokou and Xintian</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Red bandits' warfare has never been fixed. There is neither a so-called front line nor a so-called defense zone. Sometimes they concentrate their main forces in one place, and they retreat as soon as they see troops, without making any contact. Even after an attack, they are unwilling to fight against the army. The reason why bandit suppression is difficult to progress is this. According to front-line news, after the failure of the bandits to attack the two cities of Nanfeng, they advanced southeast in three columns with the Central Strategy Army. Zhu, Mao, and Peng then concentrated about 20,000 to 30,000 people from both sides to the southwest, concentrating in the mountainous areas of Huangpi, Dongpi, Qidu, and Jiudu in the southern part of Yihuang, scattered in the mountains and dense forests. On the 1st of this month, the National Army advanced from Yihuang and Lean in two routes to capture Huangpi and Ningdu. At that time, the bandit army gathered in the strategically important mountains of Huangpi were the 7th Army of the pseudo-3rd Army Group, Lin Biao, the 3rd and 12th armies of the pseudo-1st Army Group, and the 22nd Army of Luo Binghui, occupying Shimenlou, Heshi Mountain, Fulingao, and Yunfeng Mountain, etc. They all built solid fortifications, with bandits familiar with the terrain as guides, bypassing and descending, encircling the two divisions of the first column. Due to the terrain, the officers and soldiers firmly defended Huoyuan, and the battle was very fierce for several days and nights. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers embraced the determination to die and did not hesitate to make major sacrifices. After breaking through the bandit position, the division advanced towards Fuling and Shirenling, and struck Heshi from the side with the regiment. After a joint attack by both sides, the red bandit positions were completely broken. The three armies met and occupied Huangpi and Huoyuan, and advanced on Luokou and Xintian, etc. (March 7)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province's Depressed Mining Industry</h3>
<p>Heavy Losses in the Fangzi Mines</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province has always been known as a coal-producing area. However, last year, due to the impact of dumping by Japanese Fushun coal, sales in Shanghai were cut off, and the business of various mines declined. Except for the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Company and the Zichuan Luda Company, which have strong capital and still have a surplus, the rest of the mines have generally suffered more losses than gains. Fangzi, along the Jiaoji Railway, is also a mining area. There are four of the largest coal mines: (1) Xitan Mine, in Laoshan Village, is a mine jointly operated by the Sino-Japanese Luda Company and leased to Chinese for mining. It used to have more than 8,000 workers, but now, due to poor business, it has been reduced to more than 200. (2) Dongtan Mine, near Fangzi, is also leased to Chinese for mining. It used to have more than 1,000 workers, but now it only has two or three hundred people, suffering heavy losses. (3) Central Coal Mine, in Wangjia Liugou, is leased to Chinese for mining. It used to have more than 1,000 workers, but now it only has one or two hundred people. (4) Zhongfu Company, which is operated by the Chinese, used to have more than 1,000 workers, but now it only has 300 people. It can produce 500 train cars (15-ton cars) of coal per month, and each car is worth 110 to 120 yuan. In summary, the business of the above four mines is declining day by day, and the number of unemployed workers has reached more than 1,000. They have no way to make a living, which is extremely pitiful. If there is no relief plan in the future, not only will Fangzi's mining industry fall into decline, but also the livelihood of the poor people who rely on it directly and indirectly will become a problem.

<h3>Hunan Province Conducts Military Engineering Road Construction</h3>
<p>Each Division of the Fourth Route Army Draws One Regiment</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province is now following the resolutions of the Seven-Province Road Construction Conference to build 1,564 kilometers of highways, requiring a total project cost of 10,049,700 yuan. In addition to using the corvée labor method to build by conscripting labor from the 24 counties through which the route passes, He Jian has also decided to draw one regiment from each division in the Fourth Route Army to be responsible for road construction in order to complete it as soon as possible. The Hunan Military Engineering Road Construction Regulations have been drafted by the newly appointed Director of Construction Department, Yu Jichuan, and submitted to the provincial government for approval and promulgation.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<h3>Songjiang Bank Owes Public Funds and Is Actively Pursued</h3>
<p>Songjiang Bank went bankrupt last year, owing more than 50,000 yuan of public funds deposited by the Property Office, and a huge amount of education funds. In addition to the accountant designated by the court to organize the liquidation office to repay only 15% of the funds, the amount of public funds owed is still huge. Previously, the public institutions owed funds collectively entrusted lawyers to carry out the pursuit, but the litigation costs were huge, and they requested litigation relief. The court did not approve it, and it has been delayed until now for another half a year. Now, Director Zhu of the Education Bureau will actively pursue litigation. At the first regular meeting of the Property Office yesterday, Director Li Zuhua said that the public funds owed by Songjiang Bank, in addition to the 15% paid by the liquidation office, still owe 45,630.05 yuan, which cannot be delayed any longer. The public fund representatives are still urged to pay the litigation fees in accordance with legal procedures and actively proceed.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Industry Changes to New Steelyards</h3>
<p>The county government has been ordered to promote the new measurement system, and has formulated a unified procedure to carry it out in order. It has also ordered the county chamber of commerce to supervise and urge all industries to switch to the new system. Now, the Chinese medicine industry has been notified by the industry association to switch to the new system of steelyards. At the same time, doctors are notified to strictly calculate the amount of medicine prescribed for pulse prescriptions according to the comparison table of new and old equipment. One market catty is equal to 13 liang, 6 qian, and 4 fen on the astronomical scale. One market liang is equal to 8 qian and 5 fen on the balance. Strict conversion is required to facilitate the promotion.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Raises Aviation Funds</p>
<p>The county chamber of commerce previously received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, undertaking to raise 5,000 yuan for airplanes, and was informed by the county party department to organize an aviation branch to raise donations for airplanes. On the afternoon of the 10th, a meeting was convened with Sun Boliang of the textile industry, Zi Xin of the rice bean industry, Cai Jiansan of the flour industry, Shi Qinglin of the tobacco industry, and Shi Zhenyu of the automobile industry to discuss fundraising methods. Chairman Yang Hanxi immediately decided to first determine the amount for each industry association, and designated Jiangsu Bank in Zhuchang Lane outside the city and the Shanghai Bank Office on Gongyuan Road in the city to collect the funds. The fundraising period is set for three months.</p>
<h3>Request to Waive Reed Tax Survey Fee</h3>
<p>Chen Chuande, the magistrate of this county and also a preparation member of the county land bureau, previously received an order from the provincial land bureau stating that, regarding the land consolidation plan in this province, all reed fields and wasteland are included in the survey, and a survey fee is to be levied uniformly. After Magistrate Chen received the order, he immediately forwarded it to the Finance Bureau for compliance. Now, according to a report submitted by Bureau Chief Wang, the amount of taxed reed fields in this county is 16,148 mu and 5 li, with a tax of two cents of silver per mu, totaling 322 taels, 9 mace, 6 fen, and 1 li of silver. No donations or taxes have ever been levied under the reed tax item. The reed tax rate is very light, only two cents of silver per mu. If calculated at a provincial and county tax of two yuan and five cents in total, the silver dollar equivalent is four fen and one li. If a survey fee of one dime is levied per mu, it exceeds the tax rate by several times, placing too heavy a burden. Moreover, these reed fields have long been incorporated into the general land and taxed accordingly, which is within the total county quota of 195,000 mu of real and fertile land. There are no separate reed fields. Each household already pays a general land tax and then pays a reed tax, which is already an excessive burden. To add a survey fee would be unreasonable. Magistrate Chen, in his report, specially submitted the situation to the provincial land bureau for review and requested that the survey fee be waived to alleviate the people's hardship.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Order to Promote the New System of Weights and Measures</p>
<p>The weights and measures used by various businesses in this port have been converted to the new system, but some are still using the old system. It is now known that the county government has received an order from the provincial authorities to dispatch personnel together with police officers to the various businesses to register the old instruments according to the prescribed methods. Those old instruments that can be transformed should be transformed as soon as possible; the rest must be abolished uniformly before April 10th and are not allowed to be hidden. The remaining old instruments must still be sent to the inspection office for destruction. Magistrate Ma has notified all businesses to take note.</p>

<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Repeated Robberies in Shuangdian District</p>
<p>The home of Tang He, a farmer in Rugao Shuangdian District, was suddenly broken into by more than ten bandits armed with flashlights and guns at 1 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 7th). They forbade anyone from making a sound and first tied up his son Suo'er and burned him, forcing him to hand over silver dollars. They then ransacked the boxes and cabinets, stealing a total of 32 yuan in silver dollars and two pairs of silver bracelets. After the robbery, they fired a gun and left. Also, at around 2 p.m. on the 8th, the home of Qian Ziwen, a villager in Yinxiang Township of the same district, was suddenly broken into by seven or eight bandits dressed in gray suits and plain clothes, armed with box guns. They swarmed into the room, tied up Ziwen and his mother, and beat and burned them with fire. As a result, the bandits stole many pieces of clothing and jewelry. The victims have reported the incidents to the public security sub-bureau separately, which has transferred the case to the county for investigation and arrest of the thieves.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Boting Village</p>
<p>The home of Zhang Jinming, a farmer in Boting Village near Dongtang Town, was somewhat well-off, which led to the covetousness of bandits. On the night before, a number of bandits broke into the house by climbing over the wall, carrying various weapons, and ransacked the place. Jinming was awakened from his sleep and tried to escape but was grabbed by the bandits and locked in a room. His younger brother Jinshu was tied up and beaten severely, and they demanded cash but failed. They then used a sharp blade to slash Jinshu, inflicting too deep a wound, and he died instantly. The bandits then shouted and fled. The anti-bandit forces and the Lizhai Bridge police team immediately dispatched a team to intercept them upon hearing the alarm, and captured eight bandits including Sun Xiaogou Lao. They have now been handed over to the county for interrogation.</p>

<p>Success lies in perseverance, and perseverance is related to continuity. Life insurance is one way to maintain a constant estate.</p>
<p>Zhang Jia'ao</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Sidu is a government-funded student from Tsinghua University, sent to the University of Michigan in the United States to study insurance. He studied diligently and made great progress in his studies, earning a Master's degree in actuarial science. He has held important positions as a teacher at the University of New York, as well as at the Metropolitan and Annuity Association, the American Life Insurance Company, and the New York Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. With his knowledge and experience, he is well-known in the insurance industry. He was selected as a member of the American Society of Casualty Actuaries and a member of the Society of Actuaries. Among Chinese people, Mr. Chen is the only one to have received this highest honor. After returning to China, he was immediately hired by China United Assurance Corporation of Shanghai as an actuary, and has been working there ever since. He has made outstanding achievements, and Mr. Chen has contributed greatly to the company's progress in recent years.</p>
<h3>Trends in the Development of Life Insurance - Chen Sidu</h3>
<p>Life insurance originated in ancient Europe among the Nordic Races. These people adhered to the monogamous system, so their emotions of protecting family happiness and their desires to improve national life arose spontaneously. This impulse spurred them on, and as a result, life insurance was conceived. During the hundreds of years before and after the Renaissance, the dawn of life insurance shone brightly, revealing its clues in the craft guilds, friendly societies, and other charitable organizations of the time. Although these organizations lacked scientific principles and a background, they were the precursors of the life insurance business. Later, after arduous efforts, they gradually took shape. About 170 years ago, the discovery of the Doctrine of Chances or Probability, combined with interest rates, made it possible to estimate the value of life. Since 1760 AD, science and human feelings have combined, and the good method of protecting family life has been prepared. The life insurance system managed according to scientific methods originated in the London Equitable Assurance Society in 1762. This society began to issue ordinary life insurance policies, with premiums based on age and the amount of premiums proportional to the probability of death, hence the name "Equitable." As for unusual risks, additional premiums were proposed to be collected. When the premium expired, a 30-day grace period was granted. If the policy became invalid, it was allowed to prove health and restore the policy's validity within three months. The regulations were strict and have been in place since ancient times. In addition, the equipment of the insurance actuarial department and the introduction of the specialized actuarial reserve liability system are especially indicative of the company's vision and its enthusiasm for the scientific development of the life insurance business. However, at that time, each company did not follow the scientific development of "equitable" life insurance. Therefore, the evolution of the life insurance system to today's legal reserve system has been achieved through arduous experience. The reason why life insurance was not perfect at that time was due to several erroneous views. If we now discuss them, they may be helpful to the development of the life insurance business in China, and the mistakes made by Europeans and Americans in the early stages of life insurance development can be avoided. In the past, some people believed that life insurance could be managed effectively using a permanent levy method. The so-called levy insurance means that when a member of the group dies, the same fee is collected from each surviving member, regardless of age, as compensation. This kind of insurance assumes that the young in the group will inevitably grow old, and the number of deaths will inevitably be equal to the number of new entrants. In this way, metabolism will continue, and the average age of the whole will remain unchanged year after year, and the cost shared by each person will be roughly the same. This is a fundamental error. It is already very wrong to say that young members can offset the elderly, let alone whether the young members are sufficient to supplement the number of deaths of the elderly. Because the risk of death increases geometrically with our age, this can be illustrated by the curve in the following figure.</p>
<p>According to this diagram, the premium actually increases with age. It has been seen more than once that our country has made this kind of erroneous assumption to organize one-year group insurance, so it is specially stated. Even if the levy insurance system is built on a correct basis, with age as the standard for charging fees, it is still not suitable for practical use, because the premium increases sharply in old age, which will inevitably lead to the inability to pay. Is this not the same as rejecting those who enjoy longevity from the door and only allowing the unhealthy to continue insurance? A permanent insurance system can only be implemented using the scientific level premium method. The policyholder pays the same level premium every year from beginning to end until the policy expires. This level premium is more than what is needed for the insurance cost in the first few years, and the surplus is compounded and accumulated, thus forming a reserve fund. Part of the death compensation is taken from this, and in the later years, the premium paid is not enough for the compensation, and it is also taken from this. Therefore, some people think that life insurance companies are similar to other economic enterprises, and the surplus of the premiums collected, in addition to being used to compensate for losses and pay expenses, can be used as a surplus. This is also a big mistake. In the early stage of the development of life insurance companies, many people held this misconception, so failures were common.</p>
<p>If we carefully examine the attached table of insurance costs and policy reserves, we can understand the meaning of level premiums or the same premiums, and the importance of actuarial reserves in the scientific application of life insurance.</p>

<p>85 17.32 269.77</p>
<p>90 17.32 396.03</p>
<p>It can be seen from this that the insurance cost of one-year term insurance that can be renewed increases year by year, and is directly proportional to the risk of death. It increases particularly rapidly after the age of 50. According to the whole life premium insurance method, the annual premium is the same and is paid until the end of the insured's life, but the insurance cost is lower than the one-year term insurance method year by year due to the gradual increase in policy reserves. According to the 30-year endowment insurance method, the insurance cost gradually decreases year by year, and the policy reserve gradually increases until it reaches the insurance amount at the end of 30 years.</p>
<p>Some policyholders believe that the premiums they pay are direct investments, so they always argue with the company when they surrender the policy or when it expires, saying that they should be repaid with compound interest. This is actually wrong. There are also those who take out life insurance at an advanced age and mistakenly believe that the company should at least repay all the premiums upon expiration. How can Tang know the cost of protection during the insurance period? Therefore, those who recognize the true value of life insurance are only the beneficiaries of those who die early.</p>
<p>Life insurance is a science. Its success requires the guidance of actuarial experts. A well-known American insurance expert summarized his work and said: The duty of the actuary of an insurance company is to supervise the company's business so that it is established on a solid economic foundation. The success or failure of the insurance business depends entirely on precise calculations, because the company calculates the premiums to be collected based on the interest rate and human mortality rate and business expenses (Loading) formulated by the actuary. The actuary also estimates the reserve liabilities of each policy from time to time to determine the method of dividend distribution, and also formulates the cash redemption, loan, and other non-forfeiture value tables in the policy. When the policy becomes invalid, is returned, or is modified, all calculations are done by him. In addition to these various specialized daily tasks, he must also provide advice to company employees on business matters at any time.</p>
<p>Since the work of the actuary is so important, the actuary must constantly train himself with the specialized science he has learned and his profession to develop independent thinking and judgment ability, so that his opinion is firm and not shaken by external pressure, and he can make steady progress without being restrained by fierce competition. Here I would like to mention my own experience. When I was an intern at a life insurance company in the United States, I was ordered to calculate the premium rate for a certain group policy. The policy guarantees 2,000 employees and has benefits such as disability guarantee advances. The premium table I made was intended to exceed the usual one by 60 percent. If the superior had not been smart and capable and immediately adopted it, this table would not have been ridiculed and slandered. Four years later, in 1930, each company suffered huge losses every year due to the disability benefits attached to the policy, so they accepted the suggestion of the insurance industry supervisor of a certain province and sought ways to remedy the situation together, so they unanimously began to increase this premium. By 1932, the company had restricted the number of policies with this additional benefit, and there were more reforms. Roughly, the average premium rate has been increased by about 65%. Among the large companies, some no longer use disability benefits as a selling point for new policies. However, there are still many policies that have been underwritten with disability benefits, so the benefits absorbed by the life insurance part of the life insurance company are still not a small number every year.</p>
<p>In short, a life insurance policy is a long-term contract that can guarantee the economic security of family life and is related to the life savings of the insured. Therefore, an insurance company that operates the insurance business in a stable and reasonable manner should collect a corresponding premium and establish a sufficient reserve fund so that the company can cope with future compensation. It would be great if each company could compete and work hard in terms of service and safety to promote the life insurance business. If they simply reduce premiums and fight each other, they will lose the original intention of the insurance business. My country's life insurance business is still in its infancy. It is urgent to cultivate the business ethics of managers, promote the joint cooperation between companies, arouse public trust, and promote the gospel of life insurance to ensure its stable and healthy development. The Life Insurance Association of China is now shouldering this mission and is engaged in this work. I hope that it can follow this right path and achieve this goal. The future of my country's life insurance industry will be promising.</p>
<h3>Life Insurance (II) Yu Ci</h3>
<p>In the first issue of this journal, the author published the first chapter of his recent thesis on life insurance, describing how the life insurance system has become a part of social organization, its origin and general progress. Now, please discuss how life insurance is the best protection method for those who are responsible for supporting their families or who only hold salaries to meet economic needs. No one can deny this. The adoption of the life insurance system in China is the most backward, far less enthusiastic than in other countries. Although its development began 50 years ago, commercial life insurance companies have also been established in recent years. However, the total number of life insurance policies of Chinese and foreign life insurance companies in the country in one year is probably no more than the huge number of new businesses added by the United States in one month or Japan in six months.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Not Being Adopted</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why China has failed to trace the footsteps of other countries and recognize the life insurance system as a part of social organization in modern culture. The most obvious reasons, which do not need to be elaborated here, are the Revolution of 1911, and the rapid impact on the orderly evolution of China's politics, economy, and society. However, there are other reasons that need special explanation, please list them as follows:</p>
<p>In the past, foreign merchants only underwrote the type of life insurance for Chinese people that was limited to the wealthy insurance method, that is, the one that combines the double benefits of death compensation and maturity return. The fees were quite high. This was partly because China had no mortality statistics for reference, and the insurance industry was unwilling to take on heavy responsibilities for the sake of small profits, and partly because Chinese customs regarded talking about death as unlucky, and disliked the life insurance. As a result, the perception was different. The concept of life insurance as a personal investment before death was more important than the original intention of preventing relatives from becoming destitute after death.</p>
<h3>Generous Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The interest rate in China is very high, so it is very difficult to promote wealthy insurance without exaggerating the amount of dividends at maturity and slightly concealing the cost of death compensation. When the term expires, the promised dividends are often difficult to realize. Foreign merchants who do not understand Chinese life insurance often have a feeling of dissatisfaction with the income at maturity, and the public does not know that wealthy insurance contains the above-mentioned double nature, so they have a kind of prejudice and often look at it with suspicious eyes, and some even think that life insurance is a scam. Therefore, the famous life insurance actuary, the American Lin Anjun, said in his recent book: [If enthusiastic life insurance workers do not devote themselves to separately expressing the two major items of savings and risk prevention in life insurance, it is almost impossible for them to gain the attention of the investment community.]</p>
<h3>Prejudices Are Gradually Disappearing</h3>
<p>It is gratifying that this prejudice has been corrected by a certain Chinese life insurance company that was established earlier, and it has widely publicized and explained that life insurance is an important social undertaking, and that life insurance is divided into two important items: savings and risk prevention, and is gradually disappearing. This life insurance company is also the first to contribute the ordinary life insurance method to its countrymen. The life insurance industry has been greatly welcomed by the public in recent years, and the power of a certain company is really worth appreciating.</p>
<p>The family concept of the Chinese people is very deep, which is unmatched by other ethnic groups. This is also one of the reasons why China's life insurance business has not been able to develop as much as possible. As Mrs. Buck said in her recent book [The Good Earth]: [The Chinese people, even those in the poorest class, also fulfill their responsibilities to help their poor and destitute relatives.] However, with the evolution of modern civilization, the number of poor and destitute people has been greatly reduced due to the development of the life insurance business, and the Chinese people have gradually understood that the merit of life insurance is enough to relieve the burden of this family burden. The cost is not much, but the benefits are endless, which is the best policy.</p>
<h3>Impact of Convenient Transportation</h3>
<p>Furthermore, in recent years, transportation has become increasingly convenient, and the number of people moving from surplus areas to other places has increased. The relationship of family chains is not as good as before. Moreover, the standard of living is increasing day by day, but the production capacity has not been able to keep up, making those who are responsible for supporting relatives feel more and more overwhelmed. Now life insurance can provide those who depend on others with a plan for a rainy day, so that once something unexpected happens, they will not have to burden their relatives, so they are gaining more and more public trust. The time is ripe today, and those who operate the life insurance business should urgently rise up and widely promote education, then its success is at hand. The writing of this article is also due to the awareness of this, and I want to do my part to help it succeed.</p>
<h3>Memories of Long Experience</h3>
<p>The author has been in the life insurance industry for more than 35 years, and has handled insurance and compensation of no less than several million. I know the benefits of the life insurance industry to the people. According to what the author knows, it is very common for life insurance compensation to become a large part of the insured's inheritance after death. It is estimated that 80% of the inheritance of the American people is life insurance compensation, so it is taught by experience. For people, the question is no longer whether to take out life insurance, but whether not to take out life insurance. The long-term progress of the insurance business in the economic panic caused by the European War and today's world economic recession, and the fact that the value of various securities has fallen in the past year or two, but only life insurance certificates have maintained their original value, all demonstrate the true value of the life insurance business. Here is an example to illustrate.</p>
<h3>A Farmer Without Life Insurance</h3>
<p>The author once stayed briefly at a lodge in a farming area of Canada, where he met a farmer from a neighboring village who came to pay the principal and interest on his farm mortgage. During their conversation, the farmer mentioned that he had not purchased life insurance because his wife was superstitious and vehemently opposed it. Therefore, he invited me to his home and asked me to enlighten his wife and explain why her superstition was inappropriate. I agreed, but it was to no avail. Later, I happened to meet the farmer again, and he told me that, considering his farm mortgage and the future of his three children, he had bravely disregarded his wife's opposition and decided to purchase a life insurance policy for seven thousand dollars. He asked me to keep the policy in the company's custody. At that time, I happened to be the manager of that company, and I took care of everything for him. A few weeks before the second insurance payment was due, the farmer was repairing the stone foundation of his barn. Due to unstable footing, the barn collapsed and crushed him to death. After seeing this news in the newspaper, I immediately took a check for seven thousand dollars in compensation and rushed to his home. When I arrived, his wife was grieving the sudden death of her husband and worrying about the difficulty of life ahead. How could she, a widow with four children, survive? She sobbed and told me that if she had heeded good advice earlier and allowed her husband to purchase life insurance, she wouldn't be in such a tragic situation today. I then told her what had happened and gave her the compensation. Only then did she realize her husband's foresight, which she could never have matched. This incident left a deep impression on me, and its effectiveness in alleviating the pain of life was swift and obvious. Therefore, it remains etched in my mind. I use it now to illustrate the benefits of life insurance, which cannot be matched by any other means.</p>
<p>Today, Chinese life insurance companies are also rising up to conduct proper advertising. In the future, this kind of socially beneficial organization will surely be widely adopted and will develop rapidly, transforming its old image. This is what the author dares to predict.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Speech Yesterday Morning: Total National Mobilization to Resist to the End</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Decides to Take Charge in North China</p>
<p>Yan and Feng United in Anti-Japanese Resistance Across Regional Boundaries</p>
<p>Compromise and Direct Negotiations Are Just Japanese Propaganda</p>
<p>War Between Two Countries Cannot Be Measured by Military Equipment</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, flew north earlier to participate in the Baoding Conference. After deciding on major military and financial plans for North China, he returned to Shanghai by plane at 2 PM the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 11 AM, a reporter from this newspaper paid a special visit to his residence on Qiqi Road. Mr. Song said that the military plans for North China had already been decided, and that they were determined to resist to the end, no matter what. Even if the Japanese army were to capture Nanjing, their determination to resist would not change in the slightest. He also strongly refuted rumors of compromise, direct negotiations, and neutral zones, saying that under these circumstances, there was absolutely no room for negotiation. His attitude was extremely passionate. Here is a record of his remarks:</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting Outside Gubeikou</h3>
<p>When asked about the recent situation in North China, Mr. Song replied that the fighting outside Gubeikou was extremely intense. Sun Dianying's troops were also fighting desperately with the enemy around the Weichang area. Although Sun's troops had poor equipment and often suffered defeats, they were able to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, inflicting heavy casualties. Their soldiers were loyal and brave, which was truly commendable. Sun's rear was supplied by Duolun and had not been cut off by the Japanese army, so they were not surrounded by the enemy.</p>
<h3>Decided Military Plans</h3>
<p>When asked about the results of the Baoding Conference, he replied, "Chairman Chiang, Zhang Hanqing, and I met in Baoding to discuss military and financial plans for North China, which have been largely decided. As for Zhang Xueliang's resignation being approved, there is currently no official order from the central government." When asked whether the arrangements for the Northeast Army to be transferred to the rear and the central government's troops to be transferred to the front lines were also decided at the meeting, he replied, "Now that we are resisting Japan, all the soldiers in the country are united, and there is fundamentally no distinction between the Northeast Army and the central government's troops."</p>
<h3>Yan and Feng United in Anti-Japanese Resistance</h3>
<p>When asked what Yan and Feng's attitude was and whether they planned to meet with Chairman Chiang, Song replied, "Yan's representative, Xu Yongchang, met with Chairman Chiang in Shijiazhuang this time, and the result was very satisfactory. Mr. Feng also advocated active resistance, so he fully agreed with the military plans." When asked about Yan and Feng organizing civilian militias in Zhangjiakou and planning to go to the front lines to kill the enemy, Song said that he had not heard of it. When asked whether Feng would take up anti-Japanese military work and under what capacity, he replied that he did not know the details.</p>
<h3>National Soldiers Killing Enemies</h3>
<p>When asked whether the dispatch of troops from the Southwest to resist Japan could be realized, he replied, "Now the whole country is completely united against foreign aggression. The troops from all provinces are willing to go to the front lines to kill the enemy, and there is no distinction between the Southwest and the central government. While the soldiers are killing the enemy on the front lines, it is hoped that the people in the rear will also actively carry out anti-Japanese work, uniting from top to bottom to jointly cope with this unprecedented national crisis."</p>
<h3>British Envoy's Mediation Is Not True</h3>
<p>When asked whether he had heard of the Reuters report that British Ambassador Lampson was going to serve as a mediator again and that the Japanese side had proposed demarcating the Great Wall area from Yuguan to Gubeikou as a neutral zone, he replied, "There is absolutely no such thing. Under the current circumstances, compromise and direct negotiations are all propaganda released by the Japanese side to ease international opinion. We will resist to the end, no matter what. Resistance will follow wherever the Japanese army goes. Even if the Japanese army could capture Nanjing, our determination to resist and our military plans will not change."</p>
<h3>A Death Struggle With the Enemy</h3>
<p>When asked, "In the President's previous speech, he said that our army was from the seventeenth or eighteenth century and could not fight against the Japanese army. Then this time, I am afraid we will repeat the mistakes of Jehol. What do you think?" Mr. Song replied firmly, "This is precisely my strongest expression. Resistance cannot be judged by victory or defeat. Victory is certainly gratifying, but even in defeat, we will continue to fight. Moreover, what I call the seventeenth and eighteenth-century army refers to Tang Yulin's troops. There are many excellent troops in the country, and we cannot generalize. We should take the Jehol incident as a lesson and improve the weaknesses of our army so that we can defeat the enemy. Moreover, war between two countries absolutely cannot be judged by the superiority of military equipment and the strength of the army. Suppose Germany had cannons six inches in diameter, several hundred more than France, would France therefore surrender? Or, if the number of British battleships were several times that of Japan, would Japan immediately surrender? Therefore, comparing the strength of military equipment and troops means that there is no war between the two countries. Our situation is exactly the same. We should fight to the death with the enemy with the courage of the nation and the unity of the whole. We should open up a path with the blood and flesh of the nation. Therefore, today is the only opportunity for our country's revival. Life and death, survival and extinction, depend on this one move."</p>
<h3>Song Will Not Go North Temporarily</h3>
<p>Mr. Song also said that since President Wang went abroad, he had been acting as President of the Yuan. Now that President Wang will return to Shanghai on the 17th, someone will be responsible for all major political plans in the future, and he will focus on planning finances. Therefore, he will not go north temporarily. Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission plans to be stationed in North China to direct military affairs. Although the military expenses in North China cannot be very generous, they are already sufficient.</p>
<h3>Punish Negligent Generals</h3>
<p>Regarding the punishment of the generals responsible for the fall of Jehol, Tang Yulin has already been arrested by the government. As for other generals such as Zhang Zuoxiang, I have not talked to Chiang, Zhang, etc. in detail because I stayed in the north for a very short time, so I don't know how to deal with it. In short, the central government will have the fairest disposition to clarify rewards and punishments, maintain discipline, and boost morale.</p>
<h3>Plans to Recover Lost Territory</h3>
<p>When asked whether the central government's so-called military plan was only to resist and stop there, and how to recover the lost territory and counterattack Chengde, he replied, "Chairman Chiang's determination to resist has been detailed in his conversation with reporters in Zhengzhou. As for recovering lost territory and counterattacking Chengde, it depends on the progress of the military. I am not a military expert, so I do not know the detailed plans."</p>
<h3>Rumors of Zhang Xueliang Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked about the widespread rumors that Zhang Xueliang was coming to Shanghai by plane. Song said that there were no telegrams to Shanghai this morning. When asked about the situation in Beijing and Tianjin, which was very tense, and whether the Japanese army really had designs on North China, he replied, "Regardless of the progress of the Japanese army, we will resist wherever the Japanese army goes. The central government has already made a ten thousand-point determination."</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Did Not Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>May Still Be in Beijing or Flew Elsewhere</p>
<p>Probably Won't Come South in a Day or Two</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang resigned and stepped down after taking the blame this time. A telegram from Beijing reported that he left Beijing by Ford aircraft yesterday morning to come to Shanghai. The Municipal Public Security Bureau specially dispatched more than ten police officers and several detectives yesterday afternoon to be on strict guard near Hongqiao Airport. Reporters from various newspapers also rushed to the scene, but after waiting until evening, Zhang's plane still did not land. Mayor Wu and Song's residence also denied the news of Zhang's arrival in Shanghai. According to a reliable source, this newspaper reporter learned last night that Zhang had sent a telegram to Acting Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen yesterday morning, but did not mention coming to Shanghai. It is expected that Zhang has not yet left Beijing or has flown elsewhere to rest temporarily. However, it is firmly believed that he will not come to Shanghai in a day or two.</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming Went to Hong Kong Yesterday Morning to Welcome Wang</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways' Issuance of Public Bonds Is Postponed Due to the Suspension of Boxer Indemnity Payments</p>
<p>Will Proceed to Clean Up the 1.3 Billion Owed in Foreign Debt</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, and his wife are returning to China on the French mail ship Aramis. They will pass through Hong Kong on the 14th and arrive in Shanghai on the 17th. The heads of all ministries of the Executive Yuan will come to Shanghai to welcome Wang. Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, took the French ship Baodao Si to Hong Kong at around 10 AM yesterday to welcome Wang. According to Zeng, speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the Ministry of Railways borrowed money from the Central Boxer Indemnity Committee to complete the Yuehan Railway and issue public bonds of 1.22 million pounds. However, it has now been suspended due to the suspension of Boxer Indemnity payments for one year and will find other ways to complete it. The total amount of foreign debt owed by Chinese railways to various countries has been enormous throughout history. According to a report from the Ministry of Finance, the principal and interest have now reached as much as 1.3 billion yuan, with the British and Belgian funds accounting for the majority. The Ministry of Railways must pay about 100 million yuan in interest alone each year for such a huge amount of foreign debt, so it has decided to clean it up so that it can gradually be repaid in the future. The relocation of the North Station and the land acquisition have also been temporarily suspended and will be decided after seeking the opinions of the ministers of the Executive Yuan. According to the telegram he received last time, Wang's condition has not yet fully recovered. It is still uncertain whether he will return to Beijing to take office immediately after arriving in Shanghai. Acting Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen originally intended to go to Europe to attend the World Economic Conference, but it is unlikely to happen due to the current national crisis and has largely been suspended. It is reported that Zeng will arrive in Hong Kong on the morning of the day after tomorrow. After meeting Wang the next day, he will come to Shanghai on the same ship. Zeng notified Wang by radio before leaving.</p>
<h3>The True Situation of the Fall of Chengde</h3>
<p>Tang Yulin Actually Retreats Without a Fight</p>
<p>The Brave Volunteer Army Lacks Leadership</p>
<p>Sun Dianying is Determined to Resist the Violent Japanese</p>
<p>The Puppet Army Still Longs for the Motherland</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency (published by the Shanghai Local Association), Zhang Huichong from the film industry talked about the true situation in Jehol at the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association. "Distinguished guests, I am very pleased to be able to participate in your meeting today to report on the situation I witnessed in Jehol and the reasons for the fall of Jehol, so as to provide a reference for your association's national salvation work. In mid-November last year, I came to Shanghai from the 19th Route Army in Fujian, carrying letters of introduction from Director Chiang and General Cai, preparing to go to the Northeast to film the real events of the national army and the volunteer army resisting Japan, so as to fulfill the national duty of assisting the government in publicity. After arriving in Shanghai, I invited Ren Jinping and Ren Xifan to cooperate in planning and organizing a frontline photography team. I also met with Mr. Xu Kecheng of your association, who encouraged me and wrote letters of introduction to various responsible persons in Beijing and Beiping. On January 31 this year, Ren Xifan and I set off from Shanghai and arrived in Beiping on February 3. On the 13th, Director Zhao of the Transportation Office of the Relief Association sent us to Jehol in a special car No. 6 to start work. All the generals in command on the front lines and the leaders and teams of the volunteer army welcomed the filming. President Song, Zhang Xueliang, and the representatives of your association who entered Jehol also met. During the filming, I inquired about the situation from all sides while talking to them. I will now report the main facts I heard and witnessed as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai newspapers reported that Chengde fell on the 3rd, but in fact, Chengde was abandoned at midnight on the 2nd. There were no invading Japanese troops when it was abandoned. According to my speculation, the 100-odd Japanese troops who invaded Chengde, as reported, did not drive in from the front, or they were hidden in a certain place nearby, waiting for Tang to leave before appearing. Because I saw Feng Yong leading four people back from the front at 7 PM on the 2nd, saying that the Japanese army had reached Lingyuan. At that time, Zhang Zuoxiang was no longer there. When we heard the news, we fled. The work of Tang and the Jehol government transporting things like carts had become a witnessed fact, which proves that the Japanese army never sent planes to bomb Chengde, and that the supply of gasoline to the volunteer army was stopped on February 24. (The Relief Association has a total of seventeen cars, which can be transported from Beiping to Chengde. Due to the wheels, the transportation from Chengde to the front line must be carried out by Tang's traffic team. After the news of Zhang Zuoxiang's appointment as commander-in-chief was released, there were difficulties in allocating cars. By February 24, the Jehol government stopped supplying gasoline to the volunteer army.) And the Japanese people's bluffing and chasing Tang to cover up their propaganda, it can be seen that Chengde was actually abandoned in compromise. As for the fighting situation, it also does not match the facts. Because there was no fierce fighting on the front line except for Sun Dianying's army, only at 4 PM on March 3, on the way back to Beiping, I saw about two regiments of Zhang Zuoxiang's army retreating towards Gubeikou after reorganizing in a place 20 miles away from Gubeikou. And the first order issued by Zhang Zuoxiang in Chengde was to order the bullets to be returned to Gubeikou.</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army Did Not Fight. The volunteer army in Jehol had great faith in General Zhu Ziqiao, and most of them looked down on the Japanese army. When I met Lao Beifeng, he and his men all said, "Our greatest need is food and clothing. As for bullets, we can still snatch them from the enemy." They had no fear of the Japanese army. According to his own account, he once led his brothers through the railway line guarded by the Japanese army to the location designated by General Zhu to collect guns and ammunition. The expressions of other volunteer army were also the same. However, the people complained about the volunteer army's food because life was extremely difficult. After the news of Zhang Zuoxiang's receiving the volunteer army was released, Zhang Zuoxiang did not go to comfort them in person, nor did he send anyone to comfort them. Moreover, the transportation was interrupted because the Jehol government stopped supplying gasoline. Most of the volunteer army were disappointed, and some even thought that it was meaningless to do meritorious service for Zhang Zuoxiang. In addition, the Jehol government's army continued to rebel. In this situation, how could the volunteer army not fight? In my opinion, if the government could formally appoint General Zhu to lead the volunteer army, then it could determine a method to provide complete assistance. Not only could the scattered volunteer army be reunited, but it could also expand its scope. The big bandits in Jehol Province absolutely do not rob the Relief Association's transportation vehicles. If small bandits mistakenly rob the Relief Association's transportation vehicles, they only need to say the name of General Zhu or Old Zhu (if they say Zhu Qinglan or Zhu Ziqiao of the Relief Association, they don't know), and they will stop robbing, and even return the stolen goods. In general, the volunteer army are all extremely brave, and they consider disturbing and killing the Japanese army to be an exciting thing. However, they lack organization and training. As for the most famous volunteer army leaders, their spirit of loyalty and bravery is not as complete as we would imagine.</p>
<p>The Mutiny of Tang's Troops. The mutiny of Tang's troops has been recorded in various newspapers, with arrears in pay being the first reason, and the Jehol government's payment of 25 yuan in Jehol currency worth 3 or 4 cents in Shanghai silver being the second reason. The third reason is that the authorities did not comfort them or prepare a military organization for coordinated combat. If the commander in advance could get the right person, a sufficient team had been deployed, a coordinated combat organization had been established, and then they were encouraged and comforted, then Tang's troops might not have rebelled.</p>
<p>Sun's Troops are Heroic. Sun Dianying's troops were urged to enter Jehol by General Zhu. It is estimated that they walked nearly three thousand miles. All the supplies were extremely meager. They could only advance in groups along the way. The soldiers were all extremely brave. In addition to rifles, they each had a broadsword for melee combat. I met General Sun in Chengde on February 16. On the 23rd, I followed Sun's army to Longhua. On the 24th, I went to Kelegou, and on the 26th, I went to Chifeng. On the 28th, Sun's army's vanguard in Chifeng had contacted the enemy approaching from Xiawa. General Sun sent a car to escort us back to Chengde the next day. General Sun is very forthright and has a firm determination to kill the enemy and make contributions. When I first arrived in Beiping and Shanghai, some people spread rumors that he had rebelled. I immediately said that it was unbelievable and told the friends in the press who I first met that I would guarantee with my head that Sun would not change. Now the facts have proved it. However, General Sun's supplies are extremely meager, and ammunition is also quite lacking. We must do our best to provide assistance, otherwise, it will be extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Puppet Army. As far as I know, some of the puppet army are in contact with the volunteer army. Because they are forced to be the vanguard by the Japanese army, they often separate left and right during combat, so that the Japanese army and the volunteer army directly contact. Sometimes they pretend to chase and sell bullets to the volunteer army in secluded places. If the whole country can unite to resist, and can establish prestige, then it is possible for the puppet army to rise up and turn against the enemy. Combining the facts I heard and witnessed, the loss of Jehol was not a defeat, but an abandonment. Moreover, the mountain roads in Jehol are narrow and dangerous. Even if they do not fight and just pile up rocks in the road, it is enough to hinder the enemy's journey. If the roads are filled with kerosene and gasoline and burned when the enemy arrives, even without the preparation of electric mines, etc., it can be used to defend against the enemy. Now, we still sit and lose the natural danger, which is very sad and angry.</p>
<h3>A Large Group of American Navy Ships Will Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arriving on April 1st</p>
<p>The Commander of Shanghai Will Arrive</p>
<p>Attracting the Attention of Japanese Newspapers</p>
<p>The US Navy fleet in Asia, which is staying in the military ports of Manila and Guam, has more than 30 destroyers, torpedo boats, etc., divided into six teams, commanded by the flagship Black Hawk. It is now confirmed that the entire US fleet in Asia will set off from Manila on April 1st and go straight to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, they will be divided into Jiaozhou Bay, Bohai Bay, and Shanghai for berthing, according to the Da Mei Evening News. Colonel Gilg, the commander of the 4th Regiment of the new commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, will arrive in Shanghai on the President Hoover liner to take up his new post. He will arrive at the New Customs Wharf at 8:30 AM on Monday. Acting Commander Colonel Moses will go to greet him with the staff of the headquarters and will send a station team to welcome him.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that the American warship Houston is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 1st of next month, and the number of small ships accompanying the ship is still unknown. However, according to information recently sent from Washington, as soon as the Houston arrives in Shanghai, warships will continue to come east one after another. The concentration of the US joint fleet in the East is still in this spring. The fleet is scheduled to berth several destroyers in Zhifu, submarines in Qingdao, and other warships are scheduled to arrive in Wusong successively in mid-April.</p>
<h3>The China-Russia Wireless Telegraph Line Is Open</h3>
<p>Implemented Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the International Telegraph Station of the Ministry of Communications in Shanghai has begun to test communication with the Moscow Radio Station in Russia. Now that the communication situation is smooth and the efficiency is excellent, the two parties agreed to formally open the direct line between China and Russia on the 11th of this month. Regarding the price of this telegraph, the fee for sending to European Russia is 1.95 yuan per word, and the fee for sending to Asian Russia is 1.45 yuan per word. Delayed telegrams can also be charged at half price.</p>
<h3>Today's Tree Planting Ceremony</h3>
<p>Held in Donggou</p>
<p>This year's Tree Planting Day, the Municipal Government has selected Donggou Garden in Pudong to hold the tree planting ceremony. The garden is located on the shore of the Pudong River, with beautiful scenery and well-organized layout, which is second to none in Shanghai. At this time of bright spring, those who go to participate and take the opportunity to browse the rural scenery must be very enthusiastic. The Tree Planting Ceremony Preparatory Committee has issued 300 invitations, each with a temporary half-price ticket for the municipal ferry. It is now learned that the Public Works Bureau has been ordered by the Municipal Government to allow this half-price ticket to be used for free ferry rides between Shanghai and Donggou. As for other people from all walks of life who take the ferry to visit, they will still be handled according to the regulations. The sailing time will also remain the same. It is also learned that the garden is only a few dozen steps away from the Donggou ferry terminal and can be reached. There are no public buses there.</p>
<h3>Various Circles' National Salvation Through Aviation Movement</h3>
<p>Textile Industry's China Aviation Association Shanghai City Collection Team No. 189 Captain Zhu Xianfang, yesterday at 6 PM, at the Hong Kong Road Bank Association Clubhouse, hosted team members, including textile industry figures Gong Yin San, Lu Zhi Xiao, Lü Zai Duan, Lü Zhong Mei, Zhang Shui Qi, Zhang Fang Zuo, Rong Xi Zeng, Jiang Qu Qing, Cao Ying, Li Xian Zhang, Sun Zun Xian, Rong Bao —, Xia Yi Sheng, Ren Hao, Hu Qing Sheng, Zhu Ying Kui, Zhao Zhi Shi, Liu Sheng Zhi, Shen Rui Qi, Li Rong Xian, Li Zhi Yi, Qiu Guang Ting, Zhu Shou Zhen, and dozens of others. After taking their seats, Captain Zhu Xianfang stood up to give a speech, saying, "Since China opened to foreign trade, imported goods have increased year by year, especially cotton textiles, which are mostly imported from Japan. We in the textile industry should do our best to increase production and reduce the import of enemy goods, cultivating national strength. We constantly encourage ourselves and dare not slacken. Now that the national crisis is severe, we must not only work hard for national salvation through production but also strive for national salvation through aviation. The invading Japanese army occupied our Northeast two years ago, attacked Shanghai last year, and this year has captured Yuyu, relying on the advantage of their aircraft to carry out large-scale bombings. Today, we witness the tragedy of Zhabei. To resist for a long time, it is necessary to increase aviation combat power to win the final victory. Therefore, in addition to national salvation through production, we must also engage in the most urgent aviation national salvation movement." Subsequently, the team members present confirmed the amount of silver to be collected and said that all factory staff and workers had voluntarily joined as members, with the total amount of silver reaching over ten thousand yuan.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, in order to strengthen air defense weapons, members have repeatedly put forward suggestions to solicit huge amounts of money from members to quickly purchase "Lawyer's Aircraft" and anti-aircraft guns. The association has appointed Zhu Fu Jiu and Chen—Rui as members to review the proposals. At the last joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, after reporting the review situation to the meeting, fundraising methods have been drafted, including (1) The members' general meeting shall resolve to allocate 3,000 yuan from public funds, (2) The members shall be responsible for fundraising separately, (3) The members shall individually recognize donations, with a minimum of 10 yuan, (4) Each member shall, in addition to public fees, collect air defense donations for each case from the parties, with a minimum of 2 yuan, and the member himself shall also donate 2 yuan (the association will issue a notice to each member to raise air defense donations for display in the office). This method is now in print and will be notified to all members soon to actively and quickly raise huge amounts of money to purchase air defense weapons and aircraft to strengthen national air defense.</p>
<p>Grains, Oilseed Cake Trade Association: The Shanghai Grains, Oilseed Cake Trade Association yesterday sent letters to various trade associations, saying: "Respected sirs, the violent Japanese are wreaking havoc, seizing Liaoning, trampling Shanghai, and now capturing my Yuguan and invading my Rehe. The whole country is shaken, and the collapse is imminent. The government can no longer bear it and has organized its troops to resolutely resist. The survival of the country and family depends on this one action. Patriotic people are all united in hatred and running around, vowing to be the government's backing. Because the people and the government are in the same leaky boat, only by working together can we succeed. Considering that our country has been plagued by internal wars for many years, national defense has not been strengthened, and military equipment is dilapidated. In the Battle of Shanghai, our army ultimately failed, not because of the lack of sophisticated tactics, but because the military equipment was not as good as the enemy's. Therefore, enlightened people are shouting loudly and advocating national salvation through aviation, intending to learn from the loss of the east corner and aim for the harvest in the setting sun. All citizens should have compassion, and we colleagues in the business community are no less enthusiastic about patriotism than others. We should all share this meaning and actively participate. The China Aviation Association is soliciting members: ordinary members pay an annual fee of 2 yuan, special members pay an annual fee of 10 yuan, supporting members pay an annual fee of 50 yuan, and permanent members pay a one-time fee of 500 yuan or more. It is hoped that you will refer to the above regulations and strive to participate as supporting members. All employees should at least participate as ordinary members. All will be responsible for paying fees, ensuring that each member fulfills their obligations. A form with the number of employees used by the firms is attached. Please fill it out and send it to the association immediately. This is specially notified."</p>
<p>Wax Industry Association: The Shanghai Wax Industry Association convened a meeting of member representatives yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Those present included (Yiren) Fan Song Sheng, (Chengda Ji) Wang Zhihong, (Chunyu Cheng) Zhang Peiyu, (Yongxing Sheng) Shi Runsheng, (Runji Yong) Wu Junzhi, (Zhengchang) Qian Jianshi, and others. Chairman Fan Songsheng reported, saying, "The captain of the China Aviation Association's Solicitation Team, Mayor Wu, sent a letter requesting to solicit members. Since Songsheng suffered from the shock of the Shanghai battle, his energy is far inferior to before, and his social circle is not wide. Although the heart of patriotism still exists, the spirit and social circle are lagging behind. Each representative should be asked to assist." Representative Zhang expressed his opinion that those who wish to pay fees at one time or assist in soliciting on their own should sign first, and the method will be decided at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Ye Jiaxing: Ye Jiaxing, Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, was appointed as the captain of the 21st team by Wu Tiecheng, the general captain of the China Aviation Association's Shanghai Solicitation Team. Yesterday, he specially invited Yu Guozhen and 34 others to be team members. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respected Sir, Greetings. Since the September 18th Incident two years ago, the Japanese have used their military force to humiliate our country. The Battle of Shanghai was deeply tragic, and the loss of Chengde was even more grievous. The reason for this is that they have sophisticated air force to assist in the war, while we only have infantry fighting with flesh and blood. How can we not fail? Therefore, we learn from the past and are determined to create an air force. This is an urgent matter at present. The government has promoted it in the front, and the people should respond in the rear. Jiaxing is not talented, but I accept the invitation of General Team Leader Wu of the Aviation Association to be one of the solicitation team leaders. I have a duty to fulfill the training of the common man, and I ask for help from others to achieve the law of the people. I have long admired your concern for the country and your courageous actions. I dare to ask you to take a seat as a member of this team, cherish your talent, and widely solicit like-minded people. I hope that gathering many can make a robe, and gathering sand can make a tower. This matter concerns national salvation, and I hope for your sympathy. I send the required printed materials and ask you to check and apply them. Time waits for no one. Sincerely ask you to work hard. This letter reaches you, and I am deeply grateful."</p>
<p>Hubei Security Corps: Zhang Jingxian, Dong Jiangwei Yu, Fei Shaojin, platoon leader Da Jianhong, and Jin Yinwen of the third defense station of the first team of the Hubei District Security Corps all believe that aviation national salvation is the most urgent task today. After unanimous decision, in accordance with the municipal government's order, all joined the association as members. As for the more than 30 corps members, they will also join, and they will do their best to persuade relatives and friends to join the association and jointly save the country.</p>
<h3>Two Announcements by the Jianghai Customs</h3>
<p>Broken Rice Exempted from Transit Tax</p>
<p>Vessels Change to Silver Standard</p>
<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Berledo, Tax Officer, issued announcements to all merchants yesterday to inform them that broken rice should be included in the scope of rice and exempted from transit tax, and that vessels should change to the newly minted silver standard. The announcements stated:</p>
<p>Exemption from Transit Tax for Co-Signed Announcement: It has been investigated and approved that domestic rice and wheat are allowed to circulate freely in domestic ports and are exempted from transit tax. An announcement was made on January 27 of this year. Now, according to the government's order, broken rice traveling to various domestic ports should be included in the scope of rice and exempted from transit tax. Therefore, we should comply with this order. All merchants should be informed, so this announcement is made.</p>
<p>Change to Silver Standard for Co-Signed Announcement: It has been investigated and ordered to abolish the customs tael and use the newly minted silver standard currency. An announcement was made on the 9th of this month. Now, according to the government's order, starting from March 10th of this year, all vessels with registered tonnage of 150 tons or more, which should be charged 4 mace of customs tael per ton of vessel tax, should be changed to 6.5 jiao of the newly minted silver standard currency. Vessels of 150 tons and below, which should be charged 1 mace of customs tael per ton of vessel tax, should be changed to 1.5 jiao of the newly minted silver standard currency. The vessel tax charged on goods loaded on the deck will be abolished from this date. As for the vessel tax licenses already obtained, they should be considered valid until the expiration date. Therefore, we should comply with this order. All merchants should be informed, so this announcement is made.</p>
<h3>Solution to the斛 米 Dispute Has Not Yet Been Announced</h3>
<p>Subject to Final Decision by Party and Government Authorities</p>
<p>The Social Bureau yesterday ordered the Lianyi Association to resume transportation.</p>
<p>According to a news item published in various newspapers yesterday regarding the resolution of the heavy 斛 dispute, inquiries were made to the Social Bureau. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the municipal party department and the bureau's representatives did not inform the Lianyi Association of the matter. The two representatives have sent letters to correct it. As for the bureau's handling of the resolution of the 斛 米 dispute, it is preparing a proper solution and will be announced after the final decision. Regarding the Lianyi Association's instigation of boatmen to strike and obstruct the transportation of rice ships to Shanghai by the rice merchants, the bureau yesterday strictly ordered the association to resume transportation immediately. The original text reads: "For the matter of strict order, it has been found that the association has instigated boatmen to strike and obstruct the transportation of rice ships to Shanghai, affecting the people's food supply. On the 2nd of this month, an order was issued to resume transportation. According to the report, various transportation merchants have successively sailed into the interior to load rice. Each case is on file. Now, according to the investigation report, the association has not resumed transportation and is arbitrarily demanding conditions using funnel 斛 米. It is extremely unlawful to disregard government orders and falsely report facts. Except for the section on 斛 米 measuring instruments, which should be investigated separately, the matter concerns the food supply of the city and the security of the rear area, so it is not appropriate to allow 放 Zhang. The association is again strictly ordered to notify each boatman, starting from today, that there must be no more strikes. If they dare to disobey, they will be severely punished and will not be pardoned. They must comply and implement the report for verification without delay. This order is issued." Because the bureau considers the 斛 米 dispute to be one matter and the resumption of transportation to be another, it is not possible to discuss them together. If the Shanghai Southern Rice Transportation Lianyi Association can comply with the order and resume transportation as soon as possible, the dispute can be resolved as soon as possible. Otherwise, if the strike is used as blackmail, and the resumption of transportation is used as a condition for using funnel 斛 米, the association itself will first be subject to the Social Bureau's legal crackdown.</p>
<h3>Zhang Haitian's Representative Comes to Shanghai for Help</h3>
<p>Zhang Haitian's (i.e., Old North Wind) representative, Duan Shaobo, arrived in Shanghai from Ping yesterday, carrying a joint letter signed by Zhang Haitian, Xiang Zhongyi, Wang Quan Yi, Liu Tianyuan, Li Chunhua, and other Northeastern Anti-Japanese generals. He immediately took it to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association to contact them for help. The letter stated: "Respected Sirs, I previously sent a letter through Mr. Yang Zhaotang, which I believe has reached your association. I am now specially sending Chief of Staff Duan Shaobo to report on the military situation and request assistance. Since the retreat from Re Tang, the rear has been shaken, and Chifeng and Lingyuan have successively fallen. Our isolated army has fought hard. Later, we were ordered to retreat to Gubeikou on the 3rd of this month and jointly defend it with the national army. Currently, our troops only eat two meals of millet porridge a day. The soldiers are fighting the enemy with empty stomachs and cannot get enough to eat. There is no way to complain about this suffering. I beg the patriotic gentlemen to quickly devise a way to provide relief to comfort the hearts of the righteous men who have been fighting hard for years. Moreover, the more than 10,000 people left in southern Liaoning have been fighting hard for months, which is known to all. Recently, due to the exhaustion of ammunition and money, there is no way to purchase ammunition. We have retreated to the (missing) area to temporarily avoid the enemy's attack. We have repeatedly sent personnel to ask for instructions and request assistance. Unfortunately, Haitian and others are penniless. We cannot afford to assist and comfort the troops in front of us, so how can we take care of southern Liaoning? I beg you to help us think of a way. We are all patriotic righteous men and should not be divided by east, west, distance, or proximity. Haitian and others' national salvation comes from conscience and does not advocate ornamentation. We only know how to fight hard to repay the Chinese people (omitted below)."</p>
<h3>Hunan Goods Escort Temporarily Stays in Shanghai</h3>

Our province's solicitation goods are being contacted with various provinces by the provincial government to discuss with the ministry. Please stay in Shanghai temporarily and await orders. Do not ship them. Qi, Construction Department of the Hunan Provincial Government."</p>
<h3>North Station to Be Moved Slowly</h3>
<p>Nanjing Electric: The Ministry of Railways previously planned to move the Shanghai North Station, select another site to build the main station, and planned to set up a temporary station on Song Park Road. It sent personnel to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Government and ordered the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau to prepare for processing. Now, the ministry has decided to temporarily suspend this plan and the construction of the temporary station due to the unstable situation and postpone the relocation.</p>
<h3>Martin Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>Secretary Guo Dehua of the Ministry of Finance Invites on Behalf</p>
<p>Mr. Martin, a Swiss Geneva editor, made extremely fair proposals at the League of Nations General Assembly, spared no effort to uphold justice for our country. Now, Mr. Martin is in Shanghai on the 6th, after arriving from Europe, to investigate China's news industry. Finance Minister Song Ziwen specially appointed Secretary Guo Dehua to entertain everything. Yesterday at noon, Mr. Guo invited the editors-in-chief and presidents of various newspapers to a banquet at Xinghualou.

During the banquet, Guo Dehua gave a speech to introduce Martin, who then delivered a speech on the mission of this trip. It dispersed at three o'clock.</p>
<h3>Grande Passes Through Shanghai to Beijing</h3>
<p>Says Chinese Misunderstand British People as Favoring Japan</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that Grande, a famous European journalist, traveled the world and stayed in Shanghai for a few days before heading to Beijing last (10th) night. He plans to tour Beijing, then travel through the Northeast to Japan, and prepare to give a speech on China, Japan, and [Manchukuo] after returning to England. Mr. Grande has served as the Geneva correspondent for the British Daily Telegraph for twelve years and has been the European correspondent for major newspapers in London and the New York Times for more than twenty-five years. He is most familiar with the situation of the League of Nations and often interacts with important figures from various countries. This trip around the world also represents several European and American newspapers. Yesterday, he told reporters his impressions of Shanghai, saying that Shanghai is the most peculiar city he has ever seen. On the surface, it seems to be a most prosperous city. The Chinese people he met are all admirable people, but they still seem to be unable to know for sure that various European countries are currently in a period of domestic turmoil and cannot devote their time and energy entirely to the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is also a great mistake if the Chinese people think that the British government is not very friendly to China.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Merchant Fleet Plans to Open Regular Sino-Russian Mail Ships</h3>
<p>Can Sail Within Two Months</p>
<p>After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the Soviet merchant fleet has first opened temporary cargo routes in China. The first step is to use chartered vessels, and the second step is to carry out formal regular shipping to establish maritime transportation between China and the Soviet Union and to facilitate mail delivery. Now the second step is being planned. Our reporter went to various parties to investigate the situation of the official opening of the China-Russia routes and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Formal Commercial Vessels: The Soviet merchant fleet first had six chartered Norwegian ships sailing between Shanghai and Vladivostok as trial runs for restoring Sino-Soviet maritime transport. Now, due to the increasing trade between China and Russia, the Soviet merchant fleet has terminated the charters of the aforementioned ships one after another and has decided to formally operate five free commercial vessels of its own fleet on the Sino-Russian route. The first ship, the "Losovsky," arrived in Shanghai in the late last month. The second ship, the "Volkovstro," also sailed from Vladivostok, carrying a large batch of timber with 160,000 feet. It can be imported today and is unloading in front of the Jiangnan Shipyard. It is expected to set sail for Vladivostok around the 18th. The third ship is expected to arrive at the end of this month. After that, a Soviet commercial vessel will be imported every twenty days.</p>
<p>Transporting Tea Bricks: Chinese tea bricks have the largest sales in the Soviet Union. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union has ordered even more. It is said that there are tens of thousands of tons in total. Now it is known that they will be transported from Shanghai to Vladivostok by sea and then transferred to various parts of Russia. The Soviet team has obtained the exclusive transportation right for this export of tea bricks. In the past twenty days, 7,000 tons have already been loaded and shipped. This time, the "Volkovstro" will export an additional 2,000 tons.</p>
<p>Planning for Regular Routes: According to a manager of the Soviet team's fleet, Sino-Soviet trade is gradually developing. In the past, Soviet goods were mostly timber and kerosene, but Russian calico will soon be loaded and shipped. The Soviet merchant fleet has decided to open permanent routes between Shanghai and Vladivostok, but currently they are still informal temporary ships, so there are no passenger tickets for sale. According to what he knows, the regular Sino-Russian mail ships will definitely be able to start sailing within two months at the latest. The operation of passenger ships depends on the arrival of the new Soviet consul in Shanghai, so that visa passports can be exempted from various twists and turns at that time.</p>
<p>Chartering a Large Number of Vessels: Kamchatka in northern Vladivostok is an area that produces seafood, timber, kerosene, and other items, but the weather is extremely cold, and it must be frozen for six months each year. Now, the period of thawing is only three weeks away. Starting in April, the Soviet team must come to Shanghai again to charter a large number of vessels, twenty or thirty, to transport fish, wood, oil, coal, etc., to Vladivostok. Most of these chartered ships are for a period of six months. Soon, the Soviet team will discuss the issue of chartering ships with Chinese shipowners in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang, Qin Zhen, and Tang Youren arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 8 AM yesterday. Zhang transferred to Hangzhou at 9:30 AM.</p>
<p>Wu Chaoshu and Peng Xuepei went to Beijing by night train last night.</p>
<h3>US Commercial Counselor Collects Chinese Tea Color Trademarks</h3>
<p>Free Publication in New York Chinese Tea Magazine</p>
<p>The US Commercial Counselor in Shanghai sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Our office has recently received a request from the editor of the 'Chinese Tea Trade Magazine' published in New York City, USA, to collect various color trademarks affixed to tea cans, advertising books published in newspapers, and even better photographs of tea stacking, packaging, and tea shops. These will be published free of charge in the magazine to help Chinese tea commerce. Your chamber of commerce must be able to see that this is a unique opportunity for free overseas advertising, so I am specially requesting you to collect the above and send them to us as soon as possible." It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already sent a letter to the local tea industry and foreign firm tea industry associations, requesting them to collect them quickly and send them to the association for forwarding.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Huang Naian's Residence</h3>
<p>Result: No Contraband Found</p>
<p>At 9:40 PM last night, West Detective Lockhoff of the Lao Zha Patrol Room, along with Chinese detective Wang Shusen and others, brought a prisoner named Huang Naian (30 years old, from Tengcheng, Anhui) to report to the Special Agency of the French Patrol Room that Huang was currently living at Yichang Fruit Store, No. 115, West Xinqiao Street, which was opened by Huang himself. Tonight (i.e., last night) at 7:30 PM, Huang and a Japanese man named Yamamoto were arrested in Room 62 of the Taiping Hotel, No. 430, Guangxi Road. It is heard that Huang is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy. Now, Huang is arrested for contacting the Japanese man Yamamoto and opposing the Japanese military's wanton and arrogant invasion of China. The Japanese man Yamamoto has now been sent to the Japanese Consulate. I am now specially bringing Huang Naian to request you to send a detective to go to Huang's residence with us for inspection. Upon hearing the report, the French detective immediately ordered a detective to go to the address to investigate. As a result, no contraband was found. Huang was brought back by the detectives to await verification.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market Spring Banquet Record</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market held a spring banquet for managers of various factories and stores yesterday at 12:00 noon. Attendees included Wang Xiaolai of the City Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Boyuan, Yang Zhenxin of the Exhibition Hall, Wu Zhihao, Zhu Dechao of Shanghai National Goods Company, Wang Yuchang of Gongxing Factory, Guo Sen of Hongzhang Textile Factory (represented by Xu Dianhuang), Renchangyong Material Factory and Pan Dechun of Huafu Hat Factory, Sun Feijun of Huahua Store, Gu Duzhou of Dahua Rubber Factory, Li Zifeng of Dahua Glasses Company, Chen Guohua of Xiangxing Leather Goods Factory, Hu Qing of Tianfu Silk Satin Bureau, Chen Bingsen of Hangzhou Products Store, Du Xia of Brothers Store, Han Yongsheng of Golden Rooster Company, Wu Mingzhi of Puqiu, Ding Hongchuan of Zhenhua Pottery Factory, Xu Shunxin of Zhongfu, Zhao Zheng of Shengde (represented by Zhang Zaoting), Chen Bing of Jinhua Company, Zhu Zumo of Zhonghua Book Company, Ye Songquan of Sanyou Store, Qiu Zaichun of Huasheng Electric Factory, Xiang Longxun of Wuzhou Soap and Pharmaceutical Factory, and Yang Bolan of Guanshengyuan, totaling more than seventy people. Chairman Wang Xiaolai briefly stated, "Today, our Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market is holding a spring banquet, and I am honored that so many managers have graced us with their presence. The National Goods Market of our Chamber has been established for nearly two years, with various departments set up to attract merchants, collect national products from all over the country, and sell them at fair prices, in order to awaken the public and encourage the practical use of national goods. I deeply admire and appreciate the cooperation and maintenance of all of you present here. In my opinion, the national goods market is like the human body, and national goods are like the internal organs. If the human body is strong, it can do more things. The revitalization of national goods can resist foreign remorse, which is the truth. However, Shanghai, in the past ten years, can be said to have been a market for the promotion of foreign goods. Manufacturers of national goods also filled foreign goods to profit. Since the success of the Northern Expedition, the people's morale has gradually increased, and the use of national goods has become an urgent task today. Our Chamber established a market in the 21st year to meet demand. Recently, Shanghai China and China National Goods Companies have emerged, concentrating their efforts to compete with foreign goods stores, which is a happy message in promoting national goods. I hope that national goods markets will be established everywhere, so that the country can be rich and the people can benefit," etc. Subsequently, Wu Zhi, Zhu Boyuan, and others delivered speeches one after another.

<h3>The Public Works Bureau Appeals Against National Soul Anti-Traitor Group Members</h3>
<p>Requesting Increased Sentences for Liu Chongwu and Others</p>
<p>Liu Also Appeals Against the Original Sentence</p>
<p>Following the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group, the members of the National Soul Anti-Traitor Group, whose purpose was to warn treacherous merchants, including Liu Chongwu, a retired volunteer soldier who participated in the January 28th Songhu Anti-Japanese War, and others, used drastic methods last winter to deal with treacherous merchants selling enemy goods. Tragedy of casualties were repeatedly staged. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession considered the actions of these people to be detrimental to public order and arrested them. A lawsuit was filed with the First Special District Local Court. After investigation, only Liu Chongwu was found to bear a heavier criminal responsibility and was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. The remaining five, including Pan Hongsheng, were given lighter punishments separately. The seized pistol, bullets, leaflets, letters, and other items were all confiscated. However, after receiving the court's judgment, the Public Works Bureau believed that the sentences for the defendants were too lenient and refused to accept it. Therefore, Liang, the lawyer of the bureau's legal group, and Wang Yaotang, the lawyer, jointly prepared an appeal and filed it with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, requesting an increase in their sentences. The appeal is divided into two parts: facts and reasons, which are described in detail, and extracts are as follows:</p>
<p>Facts: The defendants Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, and the fugitives So and So, conspired twice at the Great King Temple on Xinzha Road on November 16th and 18th, 21st year of the Republic of China. On the 18th, they carried pistols and bombs to Maotai Foreign Goods Store at 310 Xinzha Road, where Liu Chongwu threw a bomb and Cao Songshou opened fire, killing Wang Zhengtao, the store manager. Pan Hongsheng carried a gun as an accomplice, and Tian Shuiyang stood guard outside the door. Afterwards, they fled separately. On the afternoon of the 24th of the same month, at about 2 p.m., they conspired at the dormitory at 263 Tianjin Road. Later, Liu Chongwu and Cao Songshou each carried pistols, and Pan Hongsheng carried bombs, along with several fugitive accomplices, to Yuyuan Heng Foreign Goods Store at 339 Hankou Road, Yangan Lane, where Liu Chongwu and Cao Songshou opened fire, killing Wang Yirong, a store employee, on the spot. Pan Hongsheng threw the bomb he was carrying into the store, seriously injuring Wu Zhaoxian, another store employee. On the afternoon of October 24th of the same year, at about 4 p.m., they conspired at the Shanghai Citizens' Association Ninth District Office. Later, Pan Hongsheng and Cao Songshou carried bombs to Sun Guangxing Watch Store at 133 Henan Road, where Pan Hongsheng stood guard outside and Cao Songshou threw the bomb he was carrying at Xie Bintai, a store employee, injuring Xie on the spot. On the afternoon of October 25th of the same year, at about 6 p.m., Cao Songshou and Tian Shuiyang carried hand grenades and threatening letters and threw bombs and threatening letters at Maotai New Foreign Goods Store at 449 Xinzha Road and 494 Xinzha Road respectively. On the morning of November 28th of the same year, at 9:30 a.m., Liu Chongwu and Pan Hongsheng went to Deyuanchang Foreign Goods Store at 567 Kangnaut Road and threw bombs. Zhu Erkang and Hua Zhida sent letters to Jinyouji Leather Goods Store at 202 East-West Huade Road in July of the same year, using threatening words to warn them not to sell Japanese goods. Later, detectives from the Public Works Bureau's Police Department seized many of the same letters from the defendants' homes.</p>
<p>Reasons: The responsibility of the first, second, third, and fourth defendants for the shooting and killing case at Maotai Foreign Goods Store on Xinzha Road is clear. The defendants had already confessed to the police, and the victim had also testified in court. The defendants' statements were completely voluntary. Pan Hongsheng confessed in court to the conspiracy at the Great King Temple beforehand, and Cao Songshou also confessed in court to the shooting and other matters. As for the defendants' claim that the discussion was to warn treacherous merchants and that the shooting was self-defense, it is obviously a kind of sophistry that is unreasonable and unbelievable. The original judgment stated that the police could not prove that Wang Zhengtao was killed by the defendants in this case, which is actually wrong. According to the requirements of accomplices stipulated in the criminal law, as long as there is a connection of criminal intent and presence at the scene of implementation, they should bear equal responsibility. Now the defendants have confessed to conspiring twice beforehand, which can prove that each of the defendants had a common criminal intent, and they were also present at the scene of the crime, so there is no doubt that they should bear the responsibility of accomplices. This is the first reason why the appellant does not agree with the judgment in this case. The Public Works Bureau has also presented sufficient evidence to prove the joint responsibility of the first, second, and third defendants in the case of shooting and killing Wang Yirong and injuring Wu Zhaoxian at 339 Hankou Road. However, the original trial only found Liu Chongwu guilty, which is also wrong. Regarding the Sun Guangxing case, Cao Songshou threw a bomb and injured Xie Bintai, which is an undisputed fact. However, the original trial only relied on the defendant's one-sided statement and believed that there was no intention to kill. Throwing bombs can be fatal. Even a three-year-old child knows this, but to say that the defendant did not know is something no one would believe. Since he clearly knew that bombs could kill people, he still threw them recklessly, which clearly shows his intent to kill. How can the interpretation of the crime of injury be expanded to such an extent because of the defendant's empty words? This is the third reason why the appellant does not agree with the original trial. Regarding the remaining part, the original trial's recognition of continuous behavior and merger into the Maotai case is also wrong. The requirements for continuity must be the same crime. This part is only a hindrance to freedom, and it is completely different from the previous cases, such as murder and attempted murder. The appellant really does not agree with the original trial's determination of this point. Moreover, the original trial's judgment imposed too light a sentence, which not only fails to achieve the purpose of criminal punishment, but also encourages criminals. It is contrary to the original intention of the state to establish criminal punishment. Therefore, this petition requests that the court review and approve it, revoke the judgment according to law, and severely punish Liu Chongwu for the crimes of murder and obstructing freedom, and Pan Hongsheng for the combined crimes of joint murder and obstructing freedom, and Cao Songshou and Tian Shuiyang for the combined crimes of joint murder, attempted murder, and obstructing freedom, and punish them severely, and severely punish Zhu Erkang and Hua Zhida for the crime of obstructing freedom, which is fair and convenient, etc. As for Liu Chongwu, one of the defendants, he felt that the original sentence of seven years was too heavy, and he also hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Fan Gang to file an appeal requesting leniency and reduction. Yesterday morning, Zhou Han, a judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court, specially opened the Second Court to summon witnesses and try the six people, including Liu, in the proposal. Judge Zhou immediately appointed lawyer Fan Gang to act as a pro bono defender for all the appellants except Liu, who had no lawyer to defend them, so that they could enjoy legal benefits. He first interrogated Liu Chongwu. According to Liu's confession, the purpose of their organization was to warn treacherous merchants who privately sold enemy goods. Therefore, they first tried to persuade them with letters. If they did not listen, they would give them explosives as a gift. Although he went to Maotai with them, he did not know who shot Wang Zhengtao. The judge then questioned him about the conspiracy to kill Wang Zhengtao at the Great King Temple beforehand. Liu replied that he did not know about this. As for the shooting of Wang Yirong, it was because Wang suddenly twisted him from behind, and he was holding a gun in his hand, so he struggled, which caused the gun to fire. It was definitely not intentional, etc. Pan Hongsheng admitted to participating in the warning work, a total of four times, but denied shooting and hurting anyone. Cao Songshou also admitted to four times, denying hurting anyone. Tian Shuiyang only admitted to warning Maotai and two other families. Zhu Erkang and Hua Zhida both claimed that they did not know Liu and others at first and had never participated in any of Liu's work. Hua also claimed that although he had written warning letters to Yuelai South Goods Store and two other families, they were never sent out, etc. Judge Zhou then questioned the witnesses who arrived in court one by one. When it was noon, he announced the adjournment. Liu and others were sent back to custody separately for a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Taihu Kidnapping Case Trial</h3>
<p>丨The Young Victim Identifies in Court丨</p>
<p>During the first month of the lunar year this year, more than ten Taihu gang kidnappers, armed with weapons, broke into the home of Chen Tianyou, a wealthy man in Tangshan Baydi Township, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan (the previous report mistakenly stated Jiaxing), at dusk and kidnapped his only son, Chen Zurong, 14 years old. They brought him to Shanghai and hid him on the front floor of No. 3, Anpingfang Lane, 155 Xuehuali Road, French Concession, assigning bandits to guard him. They sent a letter to the victim, extorting a huge sum of money for his release, and agreed to negotiate the ransom ticket at the entrance of Baoyuli, Caishi Street, at 6-7 pm on the previous day (9th). The victim, Chen Tianyou, brought the letter to Shanghai and reported it to the French police. Under the command of Inspector Jin Jiulin of the Special Agency, detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Yaoting, Zhou Bingcheng, Bao Tan Qinyouyu, Li Jinzhang, etc., disguised as plainclothes officers, along with French Detective Henry, escorted the victim, Chen Tianyou, to the entrance of Baoyuli. Before long, they arrested Zhang Baichuan and Wang Achang, two kidnappers who came to negotiate. They then went to Room 4 of the Huhuai Hotel in Baoyuli and arrested Shen Yun, the gang leader. Subsequently, they went to Changxing Hotel on Caishi Road and Huadong Apartment on Malang Road and arrested gang members Lu Ruigao, Zhou Ruifu, Liu Xichen, Gao Bin, Wang Chenshi, etc. They also went to No. 3 Anpingfang and rescued the victim, arresting Chen Shiying, Chen Shengshi, Wu Wangshi, Fu Lanying, etc., male bandits and female bandits who were watching the ticket. A total of twelve men and women (all from Shaoxing) were brought into the police station for investigation. The details have been briefly reported in the press. Yesterday morning, the police sent the male and female bandits to the Second Special District Local Court for investigation. Judge Li Changnian took the seat in Criminal Court No. 1 to interrogate them. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the defendants kidnapped the victim in the mainland and extorted 3,500 yuan from the victim for his release. Now the police have solved the case. However, it has been found that the defendants have also committed crimes in the French Concession. Due to lack of time, the police have not yet investigated in detail. Due to the complexity of the case, it is requested that the date be changed to three weeks later, and the defendants will be detained temporarily, and the case will be prosecuted after investigation. Subsequently, Bao Tan reported the circumstances of solving the case, arresting the defendants, and rescuing the victim. Then, the victim, Chen Zurong, complained about the kidnapping, claiming to be named Amao, 14 years old this year, studying in the countryside. His father's name is Chen Tianyou. At about 6 pm on the 19th of the first month, after just finishing dinner, seven or eight armed kidnappers suddenly came and kidnapped me.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang Discusses Producing Old Operas with Sound Films</h3>
<p>Must Wait Until Research is Satisfactory Before Planning Production</p>
<p>The Rumor of Demanding 100,000 Yuan is Not True</p>
<p>Earlier, there was a rumor that Mei Lanfang would produce Farewell My Concubine with sound film and demand a reward of 100,000 yuan. A special trip was made to ask Mr. Mei. According to him, he has long cherished the ambition to produce old operas with sound film. However, he is currently studying it and has not talked to any company about specific conditions. The style of old operas is absolutely different from that of film dramas. Whether the scenes and performances of old operas need to be slightly revised in the future production is also a major issue. Furthermore, the sound on the film has been successful in terms of narration and singing. However, when making old operas, all performances, every move, must be subject to the control of music. How can it be further improved to be more beautiful and perfect? Therefore, at present, both sound recording and drama must wait until the research is satisfactory before planning the production. As for the rumor of demanding 100,000 yuan, it is even more untrue.</p>
<p>They took me out, and three people took me to Shanghai by train and lived inside No. 3 Anpingfang. The official ordered the identification of the kidnappers present at the scene. After scrutinizing the faces of each bandit, Zurong pointed out that Zhang Baichuan, Wang Achang, and Lu Ruigao were present at the kidnapping scene. The official then asked Zurong who brought you to Shanghai. He replied, "Wang Achang and two strangers, a total of three people, brought me to Shanghai." At this point, the official asked each defendant for their name, age, place of origin, address, and occupation. After going through this, the official granted the permission to set a date for further hearing on April 1st. The defendants were still sent back to custody separately.</p>
<h3>Thief Patronizes Detective Agency</h3>
<p>Hua's Resourcefulness in Holding a Small Western Knife as a Weapon</p>
<p>Both Guns of the Thief Were Seized by the Servant</p>
<p>The Great Beauty Evening News reported that Clark, a former police officer of the Public Concession, had organized a private detective agency in Rooms 302 to 307, Yitai Building, No. 2 Beijing Road, named Clark World Detective Protection Agency. Unexpectedly, this morning, a foreign thief with a strong body visited this private detective agency. Fortunately, Hua's servant was resourceful and avoided a huge loss. It is reported that this morning, when the servant arrived at the agency, he saw that the lights in the room were still on and the items were messy. Knowing that something was wrong, he quietly entered and saw a foreigner wearing a mask, holding a pistol, and tired of searching. He put the gun in his bag and was about to leave. The servant quickly jumped forward, holding a small western knife as a weapon, and disarmed him, seizing both guns. He then abandoned the knife and replaced it with one of the guns, aiming it directly at the thief's chest. Unexpectedly, the gun he was holding was a gun without bullets, and he was finally escaped by the thief. When the servant frantically blew the police whistle, the patrolmen rushed to the scene, but the thief had already disappeared. Judging from his appearance, he seemed to be a Russian.</p>
<h3>Woman Sells Herself to Bury Her Mother</h3>
<p>The Buyer Was Summoned by the Police for Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Huiying, a woman from Suzhou, 17 years old, with only average appearance, lived in Panmen. Her father died early, and her mother fell ill again last October. The family was impoverished and had no money for funeral expenses. The daughter was sincerely filial and willing to sell herself to bury her mother. Therefore, she went to Shanghai with a certain Uncle. Through an intermediary, she was sold to He Ou, a Cantonese woman at No. 336 North Sichuan Road, as a daughter-in-law for 200 yuan. The money was all taken back by her uncle to pay for her mother's funeral. As time passed, the woman stayed at He's place from then on. The day before yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau Detective Team arrested several kidnappers, including Wang Laoer, who confessed that Zhang Huiying, a Suzhou woman, was sold through Mr. Pan to Wang, a Cantonese woman who lived in a building at No. 672 North Sichuan Road. Therefore, Detective Gao Wansheng was dispatched to report the situation to the Hongkou Police Station in charge and requested assistance in the arrest. The police chief sent Detective Wang Chonghao to secretly go to the address and arrest Ms. Wang who lived in the building. Wang confessed that the Zhang woman was at He Ou's place at No. 336 on the same road. The detectives rushed to the scene and continued to arrest He Ou, along with the Zhang Huiying woman, and brought them all to the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated the case, saying that the first defendant, Ms. Wang who lived in the building, admitted at the police station that she was one of the intermediaries for the Zhang woman, while the second defendant, He Ou, claimed that she was bought by her sister. Whether the confession is true needs to be investigated in detail at a later date. After questioning the woman Zhang Huiying, she was requested to be temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for accommodation, pending the arrival of her family members to identify her. Subsequently, according to the woman Zhang Huiying's testimony, she lived in Panmen, Suzhou, and her family was very poor. She worked as a helper in a certain mansion in her hometown and provided details of selling herself to bury her mother, etc. The 200 yuan was indeed taken away by her uncle. She did not know the name of the uncle. The defendant Ms. Wang who lived in the building was not seen on the scene at the time, and He Ou was not the buyer either. She said that she bought her as an adopted daughter for her sister, and she originally planned to return to Guangdong together, but her feet were not healed, so she did not leave, etc. When questioned by Ms. Wang, she said that this matter was done by He Ou, and she was not an intermediary either. He Ou confessed that she actually bought Zhang as an adopted daughter for her sister to go abroad, and her other confessions were vague. According to Detective Gao Wansheng of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he recently arrested a large number of kidnappers, including Wang Aer, who confessed the location of Zhang's sale, and then assisted the police in arresting the two defendants. Due to the rush of time, he had not obtained a public notice. Judge Wu Zehan ordered the two defendants to be returned to custody and changed the date to one week to investigate and determine the facts. The woman Zhang Huiying was allowed to be temporarily sent to the Women's Relief Association for accommodation.</p>
<h3>Zhenzhen Society Publishes Rare Ancient Books</h3>
<p>The Zhenzhen Society specializes in printing rare ancient books. The previous printing of three kinds of legends was quite popular among scholars. This time, the second publication is two kinds of old records of Songjiang Prefecture and County. One is the Zhengde Wei Zhi, which is the collection of Gu's Yecao Hall and Qu's Tieqin Tongjian Building, now belonging to the Peking Library. The other is the Jiajing Shanghai County Records, which is the former collection of Mao's Jigu Pavilion and Xu's Chunhuitang, now belonging to Zhou's of Wuxing. The original copies of both books are the only copies in the world. Jinshan and Shanghai were the places where Japanese pirates infested during the Ming Dynasty, so the books record the military system and defense in great detail, which is especially important for studying history, which is incomparable to ordinary prefectural and county records. However, the society only publishes 100 copies, and those who want to obtain them must contact the society at No. 55, Bai'erbu Road, Shanghai, as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Deaf Painter Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Zhao Wenhao from Changzhou and Zhao Genlin from Shanghai, etc., had a fight with someone at the entrance of Dongxing Lane, Minguo Road, on the 28th of last month. The momentum was very fierce. It happened that Chen Xuelu, a mute in that place, made a living by painting portraits. When he saw it, he ran out to watch and shouted, causing Zhao and others to recognize Chen Xuelu as the other party's person. Without distinguishing him as a mute, they stabbed Chen's left kidney with a knife, and he fell to the ground in pain. The police officers on duty detained and escorted the two Zhaos to the local court, and Prosecutor Yang An has filed a public prosecution. The mute man died yesterday after failing to recover, so his mother, Chen Ma, reported to the hospital for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Relief Association Medical Team Decides to Go North</h3>

In addition to wiring Mayor Zhou of Peiping to find a suitable hospital site, its internal organization has been determined as follows: one hospital director, one medical director, four doctors, one head nurse, four nurses, two clerks, one relief team leader, and sixteen team members. The approved expenses for departure and the purchase of medicines and other items amount to three thousand dollars. The association has allocated one thousand dollars, and efforts are currently underway to raise the remaining amount.

<h3>Dropsy Is Not Incurable</h3>
<p>Dropsy Worry-Free Pill Successfully Developed</p>
<p>The National Medical Community Is Amazed</p>
<p>Dropsy, a disease, is considered incurable by the Chinese medical community, and Western medicine also has no way to treat it except by using knives and needles to open it up. However, it will still swell up again soon, so it is difficult to cure even one in ten patients. Since the Shanghai Zhengwei Pharmacy (west side street of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road) invented the [Dropsy Worry-Free Pill], it has saved many lives for more than ten years. For all cases of water-qi dropsy, abdominal distension, qi deficiency and fullness, women's blood dropsy, and children's malnutrition and food accumulation, this pill has proven effective in curing the disease. Therefore, the national medical community considers it a groundbreaking miracle drug and is happy to recommend it. Moreover, this pill is highly and quickly effective. Patients with mild symptoms can recover by taking half a dose, and those with severe symptoms will definitely recover with one dose. Detailed instructions are available. Send a letter with a two-cent stamp for postage. The price is $20 per dose, $10 per half dose, and $5 per box. For mail orders from other places, no extra postage will be charged. Same day return.</p>
<h3>Chilblain Elixir</h3>
<p>Unbroken Chilblains! Swelling Subsides the Same Day</p>
<p>Ulcerated Chilblains! Heals in a Few Days</p>
<p>Chilblains are caused by the congealing of stagnant blood. Initially, they are red and swollen, causing unbearable pain and itching. After they ulcerate, pus drips out, and the pain is even worse. This condition is particularly common in winter, and there is a lack of good remedies, causing patients to suffer greatly. Now, the Zhengwei Pharmacy in this city (west side street of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road) has invented two kinds of elixirs: (1) [Pearl White Jade Ointment], used to treat ulcerated chilblains, removing decay and generating new flesh, with rapid healing. (2) [Chilblain Wish-Fulfilling Water], used to treat unbroken chilblains, immediately stopping pain and itching, and quickly reducing redness and swelling. The prices are extremely low. [Pearl White Jade Ointment] sells for only forty cents per box, and [Chilblain Wish-Fulfilling Water] sells for twenty cents per bottle or two dollars per dozen. Wholesale prices are especially cheap. For mail orders from other places, add twenty cents for postage.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read in today's edition of your esteemed newspaper, in the local news column, about the fire that broke out at 1:30 pm on Haichang Road, Zhabei, I must point out that the details recorded therein are largely inconsistent with the facts. According to our records, upon receiving the alarm, our association departed at 4:20 pm. Furthermore, all fire brigades at the scene assisted in extinguishing the fire. The sentence in your report stating "[later extinguished by the Second Fire Brigade]" is inaccurate. Zhabei has fire brigades numbered one through four. Upon the occurrence of a fire, each brigade, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries, is required to dispatch personnel and assist in the firefighting efforts. Your newspaper's report only mentioned the Second Fire Brigade arriving at the scene, neglecting the contributions of the First, Third, and Fourth Brigades. We have always held your newspaper in high regard for its impartial commentary and prompt news coverage. In the future, we kindly request that any news reports pertaining to fires in Zhabei include a mention of the arrival and firefighting efforts of all brigades involved. We are therefore submitting this letter to provide clarification. We respectfully request that you publish the accurate details of the firefighting and the correct time of the incident in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Your cooperation in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, The First Fire Brigade of Zhabei, November 11th.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read in today's (11th) news in your esteemed newspaper regarding the resolution of the heavy bushel controversy, it stated that representatives of the Municipal Party Department, Jiang Huaisu, and the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Binghui, jointly issued a notice, which is not consistent with the facts. We were ordered this time to convene a meeting of all parties in the rice industry to resolve the issue. Through persuasion, all parties were able to deeply understand the righteousness and gradually became harmonious. All methods must be decided by party and government organs before they can be announced and implemented. Moreover, the dispute over the rice bushel is one matter, and the strike and resumption of transportation is another matter, which cannot be discussed together. Now the Social Affairs Bureau has strictly ordered the Shanghai South Lianyi Association to resume transportation regarding the strike, and will be severely punished if violated. Regarding the method of resolving the dispute, we have not been formally notified of any names. It is appropriate to request a correction. Sincerely, Jiang Huaisu, Zhang Binghui, March 11.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having just read in today's local news in your esteemed newspaper about the resolution of the heavy bushel controversy, using a flat bushel funnel, which is not consistent with the facts. The habit of using Ziba bushels of rice in various production areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been a centuries-old tradition. The rice merchants suddenly demanded to change to using funnel bushels of rice, stopped transportation and threatened, and sent people around to block rice boats from coming to Shanghai. Our association has submitted a request to the municipal government to stop it. The funnel it advocates has also been tested by the testing institute, which believes that it is not suitable for use. More than a thousand rice shops in our association unanimously opposed changing to the funnel and decided to maintain the original habits and fair bushels of rice. Yesterday, the party and government organs were testing the standard of bushels of rice, and our association did not receive a formal notice, so we were not present. The test results decided on a flat bushel standard, or the standard with a month as the transition period, and there was no decision to change to a funnel. The joint notice from the party and government also did not explicitly stipulate the use of a funnel. The colleagues of our trade read the newspaper and came to the association to ask about this matter, which is very important to our industry. We sincerely hope that we will inform you of the truth of this matter to avoid misunderstandings and have a negative impact, and we request your newspaper to correct it quickly. Avoid other misunderstandings, this is what we earnestly pray for. Sincerely, Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association, March 11.</p>

<p>Reader Advice</p>
<h3>My Annoyance | Education and Marriage</h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Gu Shangyan of Nanchang |</p>
<p>In this current society, like this... how can pure-hearted and self-respecting young people not often feel annoyed when trapped inside? My annoyance is probably a common ailment of young people! (1) Concerning schooling: I am currently a student at the provincial teachers' college. For someone as poor and incapable as I am, being able to enter a teachers' college can't be said to be anything but fortunate! However, misfortune followed. I have only been enrolled for half a year, and although my academic performance is not a problem, I am facing a major financial crisis. My family has been plagued by bandits for years, and it is difficult to even maintain food and clothing for the family, so there is naturally no way to afford my schooling expenses. Fortunately, my elder brother is doing business in a certain place and can still barely provide support. Now his shop has been affected by the current situation and has closed down, and my elder brother is unemployed and idle. He also has no savings, so my source of income has been cut off. Our school not only cannot waive meal fees, but also requires us to pay for uniforms and miscellaneous fees on time. Each semester, including my own spending money, costs at least seventy or eighty yuan. My brother's support has stopped, and I don't know how to make money myself, so what should I do? Should people without money not receive an education? (2) Concerning marriage: Marriage is the biggest problem in life. If you don't get along with your partner, then your life's aspirations and happiness will be ruined from then on. This is a definite truth. When I was eight years old, my parents arranged a marriage for me. Even before the marriage, I had an unsatisfied feeling about her. Last year, under the strict orders of my parents, I got married. At the time, I wanted to resist, but unfortunately, I was controlled by circumstances. After the wedding, I discovered that she had physiological abnormalities and had lost her virginity before marriage. Furthermore, after teaching her to read for more than ten days, she still couldn't recognize ten characters! ...</p>
<p>Everything else is self-explanatory. It's been almost a year since the marriage, but we haven't lived together for even half a month. Our personalities don't match, so feelings cannot develop, let alone grow old together. I have repeatedly thought about getting a divorce, but unfortunately, my environment doesn't allow it, and there is no way to do it for the time being. Should I resolutely strive for freedom? But how do I go about the divorce procedures? How can I deal with the environment so as not to fail? After divorcing, modern ladies are unwilling to marry a divorced man, and it is difficult to find a suitable partner right away, and divorce and remarriage are costly, which are also layers of obstacles. What should I do about this kind of marriage? Mr. Advisor! Please point out a clear direction and save me, who is hesitating at the crossroads!</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Regarding schooling: [People without money] should also receive education; however, this is a theory. In today's society, people without money are, in fact, not [entitled] to schooling. However, we want to give you a suggestion. You must not think that only going to school is receiving education. In reality, after we enter society, we are receiving education at all times and in all places, and we can study at all times and in all places. School education is rigid education. Frankly speaking, people like us have not received much school education, yet many doctors and bachelors pass before our eyes, and we have not found anything particularly brilliant about them. It can be seen that learning does not necessarily require going to school. It is better for us to do things in society while studying on our own in a practical way. Poor people only have this method, but only poor people have this kind of luck! Please don't dismiss my words. (2) Regarding marriage: Since you don't want this kind of marriage, you shouldn't have married her. After getting married, you discovered her physiological abnormalities, and you concluded that she was unchaste. This is hard to say, because the scope of the word "abnormality" is too uncertain, and we dare not comment rashly. Even if she was indeed unchaste before, it cannot immediately be used as a reason to break up with her. Because in today's society, interactions between men and women are gradually becoming more open, and such things may have become commonplace. Some women who have lost their virginity and suffered some hardships in the past are actually better than other women, assuming she really loves you. If you really don't want to grow old with her, then you can only leave the family as soon as possible, go outside to study, and write a letter to her, asking her to make plans early and go their separate ways. You should look for a job while studying hard on your own, and don't rush to do anything about [remarriage]! Or what [modern lady]! Or what [marriage]! Why is a young person rushing to carry out this matter so hastily? It's a good opportunity to concentrate on serving society and working hard on your studies. The days are still long! People who don't have the ability to live independently and are busy getting married should not only suffer, but they will definitely suffer!</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center (Text)</h3>
<p>The Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center was initially initiated and established by prominent figures of the Party and the State, including Lin Sen, Cai Yuanpei, Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, and more than 300 leaders from all walks of life in the country. Subsequently, the Central Political Conference resolved to grant a monthly subsidy of 50,000 yuan, and the Shanghai Municipal Government also granted an annual subsidy of 50,000 yuan. With superior material conditions and the enthusiastic support of all sectors of the country, after three months of preparation, the official establishment ceremony was held in Nanjing today, laying the foundation for this large-scale cultural institution.</p>
<p>The origin of the center states, "The meaning of revolution lies in overthrowing the old culture that is not suitable for the economic environment of a certain era, and creating a new culture and establishing a new foundation." It also states, "Since the fifteenth year of the Republic, the foundation of the new culture has not been firmly established... Young people's thoughts cannot be correctly guided, so young people seek a way out but cannot find it, and they wander at the crossroads or even go astray." Finally, it put forward its work guidelines as "Elucidating Sun Yat-sen's doctrines and theories to establish a cultural foundation and cultivate the life of the nation." All of this is extremely concise. In fact, it has been six years since the Kuomintang settled the country, but wars have continued, and it has long been stuck in the stage of military and political affairs, with no spare energy to devote to culture. Although it has also sent party members to study abroad in previous years, it is merely cultivating talent for one party, and even without any planning or purpose, it is obvious that it has not benefited culture. Therefore, the establishment of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center today, with a far-reaching plan to work hard on establishing a new cultural foundation, may be said to be a more constructive initiative since the Kuomintang came to power.</p>
<p>Precisely because the establishment of the center is a more meaningful initiative, our expectations for the center are even deeper, and we would like to offer our humble opinions at the beginning of the center's establishment.</p>
<p>First, the goals put forward by the center are to establish a new foundation for culture. How can a new foundation for culture be established? We believe that the prerequisite is to accurately grasp the trends of the times and the trends of world thought. China is a part of the world, and China's culture cannot be separated from the melting pot of the world. Therefore, we believe that the establishment of a new cultural foundation lies in examining the trends of the times externally and examining the most urgent needs of our country internally, and promoting our country's culture into a new stage with the greatest efforts. Moreover, this movement should be in a conflicting position with the current restoration movement.</p>
<p>Second, the so-called cultural movement should take the masses as its object, should promote mass culture, and should take the welfare of the masses as its premise. In other words, today's so-called cultural movement should not be a tool for embellishing peace, and even more should not be an obstacle to hindering the progress of the times. Taking the demands of the masses as the starting point and the welfare of the masses as the basis, and working diligently in this way, can it be called a "new cultural movement."</p>
<p>This is what we hope from the gentlemen of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center, and this is what we advise the gentlemen of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center. May the gentlemen strive to create a great cause.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Jia Chengzhang, Representative of the Teachers' Association of Peiping and Tientsin, Arrives in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Please give spiritual and material assistance to the people of South China</p>
<p>Mr. Jia will stay in Guangdong for a few days and then go to various places in Guangxi and Fujian</p>
<p>(Guangping Express News) The dispatch of representatives from the Teachers' Association of Peiping and Tientsin to various regions to publicize the resistance against Japan has been reported in the newspapers. It is found that Jia Chengzhang, the representative going south to Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi, arrived in Guangdong yesterday. Mr. Zhang immediately visited the Guangdong authorities and Zou Lu, a member of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, to report that the hot war is urgently awaiting assistance, and the soldiers at the front are extremely eager for material and spiritual assistance from the whole country. According to Mr. Zhang, since the fall of Yuguan, the Teachers' Association of Peiping and Tientsin immediately elected Standing Committee members Yang Likui, Wang Jixu, and himself to go to Yu to inspect the war zone. Witnessing the soldiers at the front, holding an indomitable spirit, fighting in the icy and snowy land, they were greatly moved. They then held a meeting and resolved to elect four people to go to four regions to publicize the resistance against Japan and to contact local mass organizations to jointly organize a support association for the resistance against Japan. (1) Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi are one area, and Wang Jixu was sent there. (2) Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang are one area, and Mou was sent there. (3) Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Jiangxi are one area, and Cai Zengtang was sent there. (4) Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi are one area, and he himself came here. This trip brought many photos of the war zone so that all sectors of South China could know the truth about the resistance against Japan in North China. He hopes that people in South China will enthusiastically provide assistance so that the soldiers in North China can feel stimulated and increase their strength to resist Japan. It is learned that Jia is from Hefei and graduated from Germany with a doctorate in forestry. He is currently the director of the Department of Agriculture at Peking University. It is said that Jia will stay in Guangdong for a few days and then go to Macau, and then go to various places in Guangxi and Fujian to publicize. (March 4)</p>
<h3>The Jing (Nanjing) Municipal Education Budget is Gradually Tightening</h3>
<p>February's salaries can still be paid</p>
<p>Since the national crisis, the funding for Nanjing municipal schools has not been greatly affected. It is said that February's salaries can still be paid with great effort, but after March, the situation will gradually become difficult. One reason is that the capital construction funds of the Capital Construction Committee, on which the municipal government relied for turnover in the past, cannot be used for replenishment (the mayor is the secretary-general of the committee, and now the committee has resolved that the disbursement of funds must be signed by a majority of the members). The second reason is that the subsidy from the Ministry of Finance has not been issued as scheduled due to the events in the Northeast and the urgent need for military supplies. The third reason is that the commercial atmosphere in Jing is not good, and the income from various donations and taxes has decreased sharply. Therefore, the funding for municipal schools has been affected. A few days ago, the principals' meeting requested the Social Affairs Bureau to pay the full salaries for February. The bureau advocated paying half a month's salary and deducting one-half of the administrative income (tuition and miscellaneous fees) of each school to offset the shortfall. The schools believed that the original method for the tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by the schools was to deduct one-fourth first, and the remainder would be deducted in installments (the tuition and miscellaneous fees of each school were originally to be handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau in installments, but one-fourth was paid first. If one-half was deducted first, the schools would have no temporary funds to replenish), so they elected a representative of the principals to visit Director Wang of the Social Affairs Bureau and asked to deduct one-fourth of the tuition and miscellaneous fees as usual and issue the full month's salary. The bureau replied that it would depend on the financial situation of the Finance Bureau before a decision could be made. According to general speculation, February's salaries can still be paid with great effort, but after March, the situation will gradually become difficult.</p>
<h3>The Compilation and Translation Bureau is Drafting Translations of Various Subjects</h3>

<h3>Shandong Province Actively Promotes Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>And increases the number of jointly established normal schools</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) Since the Department of Education decided last year to actively promote compulsory education and ordered counties to jointly establish normal schools to train teachers, it has been making unremitting efforts in recent years. Now, the department plans to order counties and cities to formulate a compulsory education plan for the 22nd year of the Republic, and continue to establish jointly established normal schools, and also actively reorganize secondary schools, primary schools, and social education.</p>
<h3>Qian Ding Holds Painting Exhibition in Jing (Nanjing)</h3>
<p>The artist Qian Zhujiu has traveled in North China for more than ten years and has served as a faculty member in many national and private art academies. His dedication to art can be said to be the greatest in North China. Now, taking advantage of his return to his hometown to visit relatives, he brought more than a hundred works of Chinese and Western paintings and took a trip to Jing along the way. The old friends in Jing were all happy to urge him to exhibit his works publicly so that people in the capital could have a fresh experience. Moreover, at this time of serious national crisis, his major works on his travels in the Northeast should be deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people and should awaken the true spirit of the people. Its significance is profound. Now, it is being displayed at the People's Education Museum on Banbian Street (Park Road) for three days, from the 11th to the 13th. The exhibition time is from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm every day.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Prohibits Guangyi Publishing House from Publishing Curriculum Standards</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The Ministry of Education believes that the Guangyi Bookstore in Shanghai published kindergarten, primary school, and secondary school curriculum standards without approval, and the content of the organizational law of primary and secondary schools and normal schools is not completely accurate and the terminology is not entirely appropriate, so it should be prohibited from publishing. It has ordered all departments and bureaus to handle it.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Promote Native Cloth</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all schools in the city yesterday, stating, "According to the report from the Zhuanqiao Farmers' Education Museum in Shanghai County, it has been found that the main sideline industry of farmers in our county is weaving native cloth. Native cloth is cheap and durable and is most economical for clothing. In the past, it was shipped to Nanyang, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and Tianjin and Yu every year, with a value of 5 million yuan, and tens of thousands of farmers relied on it for a living. Now, foreign cloth is flooding the market, and the sales of native cloth have plummeted, and its impact on farmers' livelihoods and rural economy is great. The colleagues in our museum have heard and witnessed this and are deeply saddened. After a year of efforts, they have organized a native cloth improvement association, a national cloth-wearing association, and held native cloth exhibitions and native cloth factories. Recently, they have been preparing to set up native cloth stores, and their appeals have gained sympathy from all walks of life. The government has approved the exemption of export and business taxes on native cloth, and merchants are also making efforts to promote it. We also ask your bureau to order your subordinates to wear it as much as possible. This is a real army of resistance and a savior of farmers. We believe that the violent Japanese invasion of our Northeast has lasted for more than a year in the blink of an eye. The threat to Songhu (Shanghai) has also lasted for a year. Recently, they have intensified their efforts and occupied our majestic Guanshan Jiumen, and are about to invade Peiping and Tianjin. The situation in the north is precarious. Resistance against the enemy depends entirely on the leadership of our educational circles. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has previously advocated intensifying the economic boycott against Japan, which has won the response of all walks of life. The schools in Shanghai are concentrated. If they can wear domestic goods and native cloth as much as possible, it will not be without benefit to the family economy and farmers' livelihoods. We dare to present this report and respectfully ask your bureau to review it and ask your subordinates to vigorously promote it in order to save the situation and protect the farmers. It is in the public interest." Based on this, it was found that we had previously transferred to obey the order of that museum, which presented to each school to prepare uniforms and use native cloth as much as possible. Now, according to the previous situation, we again ordered to obey. This order,</p>
<h3>The Sixth Radio Broadcast Lecture by the Municipal Education Bureau</h3>
<p>Zeng Shengdian spoke on ["The Understanding We Should Have of the Death of Sun Yat-sen"]</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Education Bureau held radio broadcast lectures, it has given five lectures one after another. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the bureau held its sixth radio broadcast lecture at the Great China Electric Company Radio Station, given by Zeng Shengdian, the chief supervisor of the bureau, on ["The Understanding We Should Have of the Death of Sun Yat-sen"]. Mr. Zeng has a long and deep background in Party affairs and politics, and has thus developed comprehensive and thorough insights into the subject at hand. His lecture first recounted Sun Yat-sen's student revolutionary career, followed by his political thought, then the circumstances surrounding Sun Yat-sen's death, how to commemorate Sun Yat-sen by inheriting his will, how to commemorate Sun Yat-sen by recognizing the recent national crisis, and finally, how to commemorate Sun Yat-sen by understanding the international situation and jointly seeking a way out for China. It lasted for thirty-five minutes before it ended.</p>
<h3>The Auditorium of the People's Education Center Can Be Used as a Wedding Hall for Citizens</h3>
<p>Citizen Ling Qihan Requests to Borrow it</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Orders the People's Education Center to be Notified</p>
<p>| Arrangements Should be Elegant and Avoid Following Customs |</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau of this city ordered the Municipal People's Education Center, ["According to the report from citizen Ling Qilun, marriage is the starting point for organizing a family, and the family is the foundation of the country. Therefore, European and American countries attach great importance to people's marriages. The Civil Code has a chapter on relatives, and marriage has a separate chapter on the wedding ceremony. In addition to getting married in church, it is also necessary to hold it publicly in a special hall set up by the municipal government. Since the National Revolution, our country has been renewed in all aspects, and the legal system is complete, but the form of marriage and the place of marriage have not yet been determined. Even in this city, the population density can compete with the world's big cities, but there is no suitable public hall, so people get married in small rooms or borrow from restaurants and hotels. The solemn ceremony is held in a place that is not solemn at all, which is a regret for the citizens. Having returned from studying in Europe, I have a lot of feelings about this. As the wedding date approaches, I am eager to improve the choice of the hall. It is found that the Minglun Hall on Wenmiao Road in this city has been renovated and has a new look. It has been changed to the auditorium of the People's Education Center. I plan to borrow this hall from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on April 30 to hold the ceremony. I have decided not to set up a banquet to avoid prolonging the time and disrupting the usual activities. It is of great importance to social education. I beg the Director to approve it, so that the creation of good customs and the foundation of public halls are all based on this. It is not only I who will benefit from it."] Based on this, in addition to [presenting the news, which concerns improving customs, the request should be approved as appropriate for the purpose of promoting it. However, the museum has other uses after 3:00 pm on this afternoon. You should hold the wedding ceremony from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm to adjust the time. If the auditorium needs to be decorated, it must be elegant and avoid following customs, so as not to lose solemnity. This is of utmost importance, in addition to ordering the Municipal People's Education Center, you should also be notified of this approval]." This order,</p>

It has been established for several years, with hundreds of members, and it has a great influence. It has paid close attention to the new art movement in China. Last year, when the Chinese new artist Liu Haisu held an art exhibition, the members of the association went to visit in teams and expressed their admiration, and invited Mr. Liu to join the association. At the beginning of this month, the association held a general meeting of all members, and Liu was immediately elected as a member of the association, the first Chinese to be elected as a member of the association.

<h3>The Second Day of Wang Jiyuan's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Pioneer of the New Art World in the East</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of Wang Jiyuan's painting exhibition after the opening. The long rain cleared, and many Chinese and foreign people attended the exhibition. They all admired Wang's style, which can adopt the strengths of the West to make up for the shortcomings of our country. The displayed watercolor paintings and ink paintings are enough to prove this. He is truly a pioneer of the new art world in the East. Works such as ["Citizens Living by the Water"] and ["The Work of Transportation on the Huangpu River in the Afternoon"] and ["Quick Sketch of the Human Body"] all show a fresh spirit.</p>
<h3>Literary Spring Tea Party</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Girls' High School Prepares to Design National Goods</h3>
<p>In view of the ways to save the country and relieve poverty, Shanghai Girls' High School in Xieqiao, Nanshi, aims to promote domestic production on the one hand and enable Chinese people to use domestic goods on the other. But in order to make Chinese people happy to use them, it is first necessary for them to recognize domestic goods as the most important thing. Therefore, a preparatory committee was specially organized to prepare the design of domestic goods, collecting samples of domestic goods produced by various manufacturers and displaying them in the classroom so that students can observe and use them happily every day. The school has now sent letters to manufacturers in this city to solicit samples of domestic goods, and as soon as they are all available, they will be displayed.</p>

<p>World Basketball Competition</p>
<h3>In the First Final of the Men's Group, China Overcomes the United States</h3>
<p>China Lost First but Won, Resulting in 47 to 36</p>
<p>Each Had Special Performances Never Seen This Season</p>
<h3>Women's Chinese Team Loses to British Team 22-29</h3>
<p>American Team Defeats Federal Team 44-36</p>
<p>Shanghai's American Overseas Chinese Basketball Team, Manipulating the Sea Basketball Scene, was defeated by the Chinese team 47-36 in the final of the All-Nations Basketball Tournament last night. The Chinese basketball stadium, packed with over 1,500 spectators, was filled with fervent enthusiasm. Although tickets were sold for one yuan, it was not enough to diminish the grand occasion. Throughout the game, every spectator shouted hoarsely, cheered wildly, and clapped their hands until they hurt, without caring. The Chinese athletes each demonstrated their strengths, striving diligently and tirelessly. Their performance was so excellent that it was breathtaking. Therefore, they were able to forge a path to victory under the pressure of the American team, ultimately achieving victory. It can be said that the Chinese athletes and the Chinese audience complemented each other perfectly. However, unfortunately, the Chinese women's team was defeated by the British team 22-29, diminishing their hopes for the championship. It is now expected that the British team will be the strongest contender. In addition, in the women's match between the American team and the Federal team, the American team won 44-37.</p>
<p>Some say that the West Qing Pirates Basketball Team has continuously dominated the maritime championships for years. Furthermore, the Marines are also a formidable force. The talent and height of the team, as well as their profound basketball skills, are widely known. Now that they have merged to compete for the All-Nations Championship, there is little doubt they will be victorious. These criticisms could be heard among those discussing basketball and in the basketball stadium last night. Some even believed that the Chinese team would undoubtedly be defeated, based on their observations during peacetime and the All-Nations competition. Unexpectedly, the situation last night showed that the American team did not diminish its sharpness, while the Chinese team's vigor and ambition were truly surprising. Therefore, the audience felt unexpectedly delighted and overjoyed.</p>
<p>Regarding the competitive situation, the American team revealed its sharp artistry in the first fifteen minutes. Although the forwards were closely monitored by the Chinese team and had little activity, the two guards, Pile and Bennett, attacked along the sides and scored frequently. The Chinese team remained helpless and had to concede temporarily, planning to develop their strategy gradually. They tightened their grip step by step, without relaxing, and finally managed to surpass the American team 19-17 at the end of the first half. In the second half, the American team continued to exert pressure, but the Chinese team did not show any weakness. They managed to maintain their lead, making it difficult for the American team to display their strengths, as if they were lost in a dense fog. With a large difference of 47-36, the Chinese team achieved the glory of their first victory, laying a foundation for regaining the two-year hegemony they had lost.</p>
<p>As for the Chinese women's team, after being defeated by the British team, their hopes have diminished. However, if the American team can defeat the British team next Wednesday, the Chinese, American, and British teams will form a three-way tie, requiring an exceptional final to determine the championship. If the American team loses, the championship will belong to the British team. Therefore, the Chinese team's only chance lies entirely in the match between the British and American teams. As for the Chinese team's defeat last night, it was due to the British team's thorough defense, which prevented the Chinese team from having opportunities to get the ball and shoot. The strategist, Lu Zhongen, witnessed this situation and was helpless. The following is a description of the three matches last night:</p>
<h3>American Team Defeats Federal Team (Women's Result: 44-36)</h3>
<p>In the first match, the American women's team faced the Federal team. Both sides delivered excellent performances, and the situation was balanced, with intense competition that heightened interest. In the first quarter, the American team only took the lead by four points, with a score of 12-8. In the second quarter, the Federal team showed some weakness. The two ladies from the American team, Bennett and Boshack, were particularly active, with excellent coordination and accurate shooting, leading to a 15-6 victory. The total score for the first half was 27 for the American team and 14 for the Federal team. After the break, the Federal team showed great momentum. The Marti sisters were particularly brave, and Bergolov coordinated from the center, working diligently. This caused the American team's guards to neglect some areas, so the American team suffered losses in this quarter, and had to concede defeat with a score of 16-10, for a total of 37-30. When the final quarter began, the Federal team maintained its strong momentum. The score was once chased to 36-37, only one point behind, leading to the belief that the American team would turn defeat into victory. Unexpectedly, in the last three minutes, the American team saw the light again, scoring continuously. The final result was 44-36, and the American team won. The referee was Zhou Jiaqi.</p>

<h3>Crushing Defeat for Chinese Team (Women's): British Team Wins 29-22</h3>
<p>Tie in First Quarter</p>
<p>The second match was the women's final between the Chinese and British teams. At the start, the Chinese team had good fortune. Pan Yueying, with Yang Sen's assistance, opened the scoring. Soon after, Yang also scored, taking a 4-0 lead. The British players surrounded the basket and shot repeatedly, but their technique was lacking, and none of their shots went in. Turning back, Yang Sen scored again, bringing the Chinese team to six points. The British team launched a vigorous attack. The Prince sisters, tall and strong, had an advantage. Haymont was lively and brave, difficult to defend. The three players scored alternately, tying the score at 6-6.</p>
<p>British Team Slightly Wins Second Quarter</p>
<p>At the beginning of this quarter, Yang Sen missed a shot under the basket. She then threw two more shots, but neither went in. Before the sighs subsided, the British team scored four more points in a row, surpassing the Chinese team (10-6). Miss Pan unleashed her power, scoring another basket. V. Prince scored a free throw. Yang Sen added another basket. Amid the neck-and-neck competition, the Chinese team failed to gain an advantage in the early stage, and ultimately lost to the British team by one point, 12-13, becoming the total score for the first half.</p>
<p>Third Quarter Gets Worse and Worse</p>
<p>After the break, the British team's momentum grew stronger and their strength increased. They scored three consecutive baskets, making it impossible for the Chinese team to recover. After several efforts, Chen Rongming only scored one point from a free throw, and Yang Sen scored one basket, while the British team scored three more baskets, bringing the score to 25-15. The Chinese team was ten points behind. Seeing this, the Chinese team's defense showed signs of panic. Even Wang Zhixin and Huang Shuhua, who were usually known for their stability, could not calm down at this point. The forwards had difficulty getting the ball, and the opposing team took every step cautiously, defending relentlessly, preventing the Chinese team from having any opportunities.</p>
<p>Fourth Quarter Yields Little Result</p>
<p>In the final quarter, the Chinese team fought with their backs to the wall, launching a full-scale attack. Sure enough, the team's momentum turned slightly. Pan Yueying scored first, and Chen Rongming scored a point from a free throw. Following this, Pan Yueying scored again, scoring five consecutive points, creating a renewed atmosphere. The cheers from the audience were like rekindled ashes, becoming heated again. However, in the end, little was achieved, and there was nothing to be done. The final result was 29 points for the British team and 22 points for the Chinese team. The referee was Touren.</p>

<h3>Chinese Team Achieves First Victory (Men's), Defeats American Team 47-36</h3>
<p>American Team Slightly Wins</p>
<p>After the women's match, the exciting main event, the men's first final between the Chinese and American teams, began. Cheers, applause, shouts, and laughter erupted together. Officials Erle and Li Zuqi inspected the two teams, and the battle began, full of vigor and vitality. Lu Zhongen missed the first shot, and was immediately attacked and scored two goals. The Chinese team fought hard. Feng Nianhua scored three consecutive points. The American team immediately retaliated, with Qulaqiu scoring a free throw and Bennett scoring two consecutive goals, gaining the upper hand first and creating a daunting atmosphere. The Chinese team had to temporarily concede.</p>
<p>Gradually Showing Strength</p>
<p>After this period, the Chinese team gradually displayed its strength. After Wu Guolin scored, Smith immediately returned the favor with a basket. Kong Guangyi added another basket, and Qi'er returned another. In this situation of persistent struggle, the Chinese athletes suddenly pounced like hungry tigers, with Wu Guolin, Lu Zhongen, and Kong Guangyi scoring five points, trailing the American team by only one point (13-14). Amid the fierce battle and shouting, Qian Jingyong made a wonderful corner shot, and the Chinese team suddenly surpassed the American team 15-14.</p>
<p>Turning the Tide</p>
<p>Before long, Pile scored a free throw to tie the game, and Bennett attacked from the side, scoring a basket. The Chinese team suddenly trailed by two points again. At this time, the Chinese team's spirit was high, without the slightest sign of discouragement. Kong Guangyi dribbled the ball to the basket and shot, scoring in one go. At the same time, Smith committed a defensive foul, resulting in an additional free throw, which Kong also scored. The Chinese team then scored three consecutive points, seeing the light of day again. Qian Jingyong also scored a free throw. The first half then came to an end. Checking the score, the Chinese team took the lead 19-17.</p>
<p>Immense Momentum</p>
<p>The battle resumed, and Qulaqiu scored the first point with a free throw. On the Chinese side, Qian Jingyong and Feng Nianhua scored consecutively, taking the lead 23-18. The cheers then became even louder, shaking the surroundings. The competition became more intense, and the situation became more exciting. The American team tried hard to struggle, and Qi'er scored two baskets. Lu Zhongen and Kong Guangyi then intensified their monitoring, with each soldier and general performing their duties and having no time to slack off. Therefore, the battle became increasingly intense. The Chinese team broke through the copper wall, with each player striving to be the first and making extraordinary contributions, suddenly taking the lead 35-27. Their momentum was unstoppable.</p>
<p>American Forces Unable to Endure</p>
<p>The American forces, suffering this setback, showed obvious signs of being unable to endure. They temporarily halted the battle to reorganize their forces, hoping to retaliate later. Sure enough, Bennett scored a basket. However, how could the Chinese team concede? Feng Nianhua won a free throw, scoring one point. After Qi'er scored, there seemed to be some improvement. However, Wu Guolin and Feng Nianhua scored two more baskets, adding four points. The American team fell behind by nine points, increasingly unable to endure at 31-40. At this time, there were still four minutes left. The American team might still be able to catch up, but unfortunately, the Chinese team's spirit was too strong, and there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>Troop Deployment</p>
<p>At this point, the American team made a major troop deployment, replacing all players except Bennett, hoping to use a plan of waiting for work with ease and making a desperate gamble. However, frequent fouls reduced the interest in the competition, and it did not help the overall situation. Only Maoli and Bai'erte each scored a basket. On the Chinese side, they scored another seven points. In the last minute, Lu Zhongen, a veteran of the Chinese defense, was sent off due to four fouls. Fortunately, it did not affect the overall situation. The final result was 47-35, and the Chinese team won its first victory.</p>

<h3>A Good Medicine for Treating Generals Who Retreat Without a Fight</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Rehe (Jehol) and Chengde have fallen again, and Tang Yulin fled without a fight! Alas! Upon hearing this news, I was awakened and realized that our China has been maintaining millions of soldiers, spending billions of taels in military expenses, all of which are the people's blood and sweat, wasted in vain, without any use! Later, I thought that this way of fighting is such that before the engagement, the appearance and set-up is more than adequate, but as soon as there is contact, they turn tail and run, how can this be allowed? Therefore, I am restating the method of [treating retreat without fighting] from the ancients, which may give some warning to those in the North who still hold military power. What method is that? To make them set foot on the battlefield, they must first know shame. To make them know shame, then the government must first have laws. If there are no laws, then the subordinates will naturally have no courage to kill the enemy. Now, in this type of fighting where they advance at the first sound and retreat at the first scare, frankly speaking, every commander and soldier has the mentality of not wanting to die, hoping to be lucky enough to survive as the best option. In this case, how can they hold the territory and defeat the enemy? Naturally, as Mencius said, they will [throw away their armor and drag their weapons as they flee]. Therefore, the ancient military books say it well: [Teaching war must first clarify shame, and clarifying shame must first enforce the law.] If you abandon these two sentences from the ancients, then it will be terrible.</p>
<p>How should the method be used? Those currently in charge of military and political affairs should quickly issue a strict decree, announcing to the anti-Japanese generals and soldiers that anyone who encounters the enemy and retreats, using excuses to cleverly evade, will be killed without mercy; anyone who fails to rescue in battle, causing military delays, will be killed without mercy; and anyone who fails to effectively defend, allowing the enemy to escape, will be killed without mercy. Once the military orders are strict, the morale of the soldiers will be greatly boosted. Moreover, with clear rewards and punishments, those who have merit and those who are guilty will become ironclad cases. There is no need to worry that there will be no heroes who will come out to save the country. Leaving aside the distant past, let me talk about the Qing Dynasty. In the battle of Jinchuan, the strategist Zhang Guangsi was defeated. In the battle of the Hui region, General Yakohashan was defeated. In the battle of Wushi, the advisor Na Shitong was defeated. In the battle of Burma, the Grand Secretary Yingjue was also defeated. At that time, the Qing court was still able to use the national law to declare their crimes of failure and the punishments for losing territory, executing them one by one. Alas! Does the current central government lack even this, falling short of the previous dynasty?</p>
<h3>The Over-Abundance in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>(No Way to Alleviate)</p>
<p>Shanghai, such a metropolis in the East, seems very prosperous and bustling in every way. If you close one eye and open the other to take a careful look, every level of society feels the panic of overabundance.</p>
<p>First is the overabundance of women in Shanghai. Walking along the streets in all directions of the Great World at night, countless young women stand there seeking men. Playgrounds, large hotels, cafes, and dance halls all have women stockpiled who cannot be sold off due to this system of overproduction.</p>
<p>Second is the overabundance of talent. Schools that produce talent mechanically manufacture large batches of talent every year, hoping to sell them off to society. The small society cannot accommodate the endless amount of talent, so talent has no choice but to automatically devalue itself in order to be sold off as soon as possible. Therefore, when an advertisement is posted for a clerk with a monthly salary of twenty yuan, high school graduates and college students will come to apply.</p>
<p>Third is the overabundance of money. Banks are constantly issuing ten million or eight million, which the banks give to capitalists, the capitalists distribute to the poor, and the poor take home to buy rice, firewood, pay rent, and redeem pawned items. In less than three days, it has already passed through the hands of the capitalists again and is deposited in the bank. Therefore, banks, feeling the overabundance of money, must think of ways to sell it off to the market again.</p>
<p>Fourth is the overabundance of houses. People in Shanghai love to join in the fun. When it comes to housing, they like to squeeze seven or eight families into a shikumen building, building several additional mezzanine floors, not caring at all. They just want to be around crowds. However, this troubles the real estate companies and large landlords. They build houses with three floors above and three floors below, five floors above and five floors below, three-story buildings, and four-story buildings, but no one asks about them.</p>
<p>There are many things that are overabundant in Shanghai, and it is impossible to say them all at once. Just take us, the literary beggars who submit articles, for example. We are suffering from an overabundance of material in our withered intestines, unable to excrete it.</p>
<p>As for the editorial offices of various magazines and newspapers, which one is not suffering from an overabundance of manuscripts, tiring the tea attendants who have to empty the wastepaper baskets every day.</p>
<h3>The Bee's Sting</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>Both the rose's thorns and the bee's sting are things that prick people and cause pain; but people like to accept the rose's thorns and are unwilling to accept the bee's sting. What is this psychology?</p>
<p>Pricking the muscles of a rich person with a fine embroidery needle will surely cause him to cry out "Ouch!"; if you were to peel the skin off a rich person's head, he would only shout "Ouch!" a few times, what is this psychology?</p>
<p>A miser who does not know how to use money will eventually allow someone he does not know to enjoy the money that countless students have earned with their hard work. What is meant by someone he does not know? Aren't the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of a miser people whom the miser does not know?</p>
<p>Health experts and doctors are most afraid of microbes, saying they are the demons that spread disease; towels, stamps, and fingernails are all bases for germs and must be carefully watched. However, when it comes to a woman's lips and colorful banknotes, they don't care about germs or infection, desperately wanting to kiss and caress them.</p>
<h3>Wastepaper Basket</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>丨The Japanese's Cunning Plan丨</p>
<p>The wastepaper basket, speaking of its inherent purpose, is nothing more than a receptacle for discarded paper scraps and useless, torn pieces of writing. In itself, it can be fashioned from a few thin bamboo strips. Such a thing is not worthy of importance or attention.</p>
<p>Not only does no one value the wastepaper basket, but some intellectuals (contributors) are opposed to it. It squats in the editor's office of a newspaper, where the editor often befriends it. It can unceremoniously swallow the hard-won creations of contributors. Its existence is only acknowledged by old-fashioned, moralistic types who, out of respect for written words, often inscribe the words "wastepaper basket" in their minds. Otherwise, no one pays it any attention. Recently, this newspaper carried a Hankou special dispatch:</p>
<p>[The Japanese are probing our military and political situation in many ways, buying wastepaper baskets from various agencies for fifty yuan apiece. The authorities have ordered all agencies to take strict precautions.]</p>
<p>According to the above, the Japanese are willing to pay fifty yuan for a wastepaper basket that no one pays attention to. Using heavy profit to tempt people, their insidious schemes are truly cunning and vicious. From this fact, I think deeply. The Japanese are willing to spend a lot of money to buy a trivial and useless wastepaper basket to listen to our country's situation. But seek facts from piles of waste paper. The more these places see the meticulousness of others, the more our domestic compatriots must increase their vigilance. Although the Japanese are cunning, they will be useless!</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Fishing</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yi</p>
<p>丨Sketches from a Crossroads丨</p>
<p>A rickshaw came speeding from afar. Because it was going too fast, the rickshaw puller inadvertently tripped over a stone, his hand slipped, and he staged a great somersault—a comical "fishing" scene. From the rickshaw puller's perspective, it was unavoidable; from the passenger's perspective, there was nothing to be done; but the onlookers broke into a great discussion.</p>
<p>"Hey! This is the center of the city, not a river. Why are you fishing? What a joke! What a joke!" This one is a modern version of Chun Yuyi, a man of similar character.</p>
<p>"This gentleman's somersault skills are impressive! Look: he can flip from the rickshaw to the ground. Excellent!" This is another one in the tone of Charlie Chaplin of the East. "Rickshaw puller! Rickshaw puller! If you don't want to do this business, you can directly refuse. You shouldn't give people a hard time secretly." This one is like a politician, good at picking on frivolous young people.</p>
<p>"A man falling means shade, a woman falling means sunshine. It's probably going to rain again! Therefore..." The prophet is speaking.</p>
<p>"Rickshaw puller, you're too careless! Today you're pulling this gentleman, it doesn't matter; but what if you were pulling a pregnant woman?" The critic is lecturing.</p>
<p>"What a pity! What a pity! A new piece of clothing is dirtied!" The grandmother who burns incense and chants Buddhist scriptures every day is speaking out of love for clothing.</p>
<p>The passenger, with a red face, looked at the soiled clothing and left in a hurry. The rickshaw puller turned the rickshaw over, tidied up the cushions and other things, pulled up the rickshaw, lowered his head, and slowly pulled it elsewhere. The onlookers stopped talking.</p>
<p>But from this point, we can see the exposure of the inferior nature of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Full-Length Novel</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter One</p>
<p>With Kind Hospitality, He Urges the Poor Woman to Recall</p>
<p>Entering the Door with Generosity, He Stands Out as a Martial Hero</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang saw that the two rooms here were so small that there was only room to turn around. The outer room was piled with coal briquettes, broken tables and chairs, jars and pots, and a broken mud stove. The inner room had an earthen kang that took up two-thirds of the room. At the head of the kang was a small two-drawer table, one side against the kang and the other against the wall. Besides that, there was only a small square stool and a broken chair. The kang was covered with a reed mat that was worn in several places. At the head of the kang, against the wall, was a blue cloth quilt roll, with two blue cloth round pillows on top. Beside the quilt was a broken rattan basket and a broken black wooden box. This was their family property. From this, it seemed that the Yang family was very poor. When Jiang saw him walk into the house, he looked a bit hesitant. Figuring that he had nowhere to settle, she said with a smile, "Our poor house doesn't even have a place to sit. Why don't you sit on the kang?" Zhao Ziqiang said with a smile, "From now on, we'll share the same gate. Don't be polite when coming and going." As he spoke, he was about to sit down on the kang when he heard a woman's voice from the outer room calling out, "Mom, come quickly, I can't hold it." As she spoke, a girl of about twenty, carrying a large basket of cabbage, staggered in. Suddenly seeing a man in a military uniform sitting on the edge of her kang, she couldn't help but be shocked. She put down the basket of cabbage, shrank back, and retreated out the door. Zhao Ziqiang knew that this was Jiang's daughter, but seeing her so surprised, he didn't know why. He stood up, also surprised. Jiang then said with a smile, "This is my daughter. She's shy and can't speak when she sees people." Zhao Ziqiang said with a smile, "It's also my fault for being presumptuous. How can a soldier barge into someone's house at random? I'll take my leave." Saying this, he was about to walk outside. Jiang felt very sorry when she saw this, so she said with a smile, "If you put it that way, soldiers can't even leave the gate. Old girl, come here, this is Company Commander Zhao, who's renting the room in our backyard." Only then did the old girl come in and nod to him, saying, "Please sit for a while, have a bowl of water before you leave. We don't even have a place to stand here." (9)</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3>Infant Happiness</h3>
<p>— Pei Ying</p>
<p>Dear readers, have you heard of these Western folk common knowledge and strange superstitions about babies?</p>
<p>Before taking a baby downstairs, you should always take him upstairs. If the family doesn't have a ladder or a staircase to a higher floor, then the nanny who raises the baby should hold him in her arms and stand on a chair. This indicates that the child will be able to stand on his own in the world in the future.</p>
<p>On the day a baby is born, if the family's hen also lays an egg, this egg is a "happiness egg" and should be given to the baby and kept safe for him forever.</p>
<p>The first time a baby is taken out after birth, he should be given an egg, a piece of bread, and a little salt, and in the same place, it is believed that giving him money is also infinitely happy. They believe that giving this kind of gift indicates that this child will not be poor in the future.</p>
<p>Shaking an empty cradle is believed to cause great disaster. In Sweden, they believe that shaking an empty cradle will make the child noisy. The Dutch say that shaking an empty cradle is too unlucky and can even cause the child to die young.</p>
<p>In the west of England, a baby's right hand is not washed until after he has been baptized, which indicates that he will be rich in the future.</p>
<p>In many places, a baby's nails are not cut until he is one year old, and then the baby's mother uses her teeth to bite off his nails. The reason for biting instead of cutting is, as far as I know, they all believe that if scissors are used to cut the nails, the child will inevitably become a petty thief in the future.</p>
<p>In some places, the baby's first cut nails are buried under a pagoda tree, which was considered a sacred tree in the past. They claim that if this is done, the child will grow up to be a famous singer.</p>
<p>If a baby cries during baptism, it is his way of scaring away the demons lying in wait around him. Many people believe that the baby's crying is the sound made by the demons around the baby being driven away by the baptismal water. If he doesn't cry at this time, then when he grows up, his temper will be stubborn and his behavior will be evil. I have also heard people say that crying well during baptism predicts that he will have a healthy and long life in the future.</p>
<p>In Italy, people believe that a butterfly flying around a baby's cradle is the baby's guardian angel.</p>
<p>In Ireland, people believe that there is a kind of demon that specializes in stealing babies and leaving a substitute. Since knowing that this demon doesn't like cold iron very much and is a little afraid of it, they put a fire stick in the cradle to keep it away. Danish mothers put some sharp objects in the cradle to protect the baby in their cradle.</p>
<p>In Scotland, when a child first learns to eat, they carefully observe which hand he uses to take food to his mouth. If he uses his left hand, the parents must sigh and say that his future is not very good.</p>
<p>In Sweden, a book should be placed under the head of a newborn baby, which is said to make him learn to read and write faster in the future. They also say that during the period before a baby is baptized, the lights can never be turned off, otherwise demons will come, and when the mother is breastfeeding, no one can pass between the baby and the lights under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Children born on Sunday are considered to be happy; if a baby has a mole on his neck, it is considered to be especially happy, as the poem proves:</p>
<p>[A mole on the neck,</p>
<p>Earning money is countless.]</p>

<h3>Financial Midday: Gold Market Volatility Not Weak</h3>
<p>Silver Market Falls, Exchange Rates Tighten, Highest at 711.5 Taels</p>
<p>American Silver Purchase Proposal Revived, Selling Pressure Seen Before Closing</p>
<p>Outcome Remains Good at 6.8 Taels Even, Few Round Number Transactions</p>
<p>The gold market trended positively yesterday, but ultimately, due to overseas conditions favoring silver prices, it experienced a brief turmoil. Initially, due to foreign telegrams indicating that London Spot narrowed by 0.25 recently and Forward narrowed by 0.3125, the silver price (New York) was not initially received. Later, a drop of 0.25 was received, so the market opened high at 704 taels. The exchange market opened tight, slightly loosening mid-way, likely because the HSBC listing shilling remained unchanged. As soon as the gold market opened, it rose, gradually recovering, with June U.S. dollars at 33.625 difficult to settle. Soon, even 0.5 was difficult to settle, but the trend was moderate. The gold market also hovered and rose, extremely calm, but the trend eventually became tense. June U.S. dollars gradually tightened to 33.125 after entering, a 0.5 improvement from the initial opening. The gold price surged by more than 10 taels, reaching 711.5 taels, struggling greatly, hovering around 10 taels for a long time. However, in these troubled times, bad news arrives frequently. Foreign telegrams indicated that U.S. Congressman Pittman had proposed three bills to the government: (1) Request the government to purchase 250 million silver ounces until the silver price rises to $1.25; (2) Allow Britain to repay a portion of its war debt with silver; (3) Request the government to purchase silver monthly to mint subsidiary coins until the silver price reaches $0.45. Upon receiving this news, selling pressure arose within the market. The exchange market also hardened, gradually falling to 702.3 taels. Shortly thereafter, the noon close was 703.5 taels. The midday trend was extremely stable, due to swap relationships. As for the U.S. silver purchase bill, only the third item seemed to have practical prospects, the first item seemed excessive. However, people's hearts were only temporarily affected by the blow. Scorched red remained untraded, with the price around an additional 30 taels. The March-April swap was offered by short sellers, from 19 taels to 25 taels. The midday market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening saw a gross bid of 700 taels, because the exchange market opened with a recent British exchange rate of 1 shilling 9 pence and a U.S. exchange rate of 32.25 yuan, both tighter than the previous close. Fuyu and others delivered bars, rising to over 0.05 taels. Sumitomo bought June U.S. dollars at 33.625, but this price was difficult to achieve, gradually retreating to 0.034 taels. At 9:30, the market opened at 704 taels, an increase of 7.3 taels from the previous close. Chunyuan, Yongfu, and Fuyu entered the market with bars, rising to over 5 taels. Zhifeng, Yongyuan, and Chun also bought, and rose to over 8 taels. The exchange market tightened slightly, with June U.S. dollars at 0.5 yuan unable to settle, so it rose to 9 taels. At this point, Xiexing and Yongzeng came to deliver bars, but because Bingxing limited the sales of bars, it did not rise further. Small investors sold off, and retreated to around 7 taels. Shengda and Hongli came to deliver, pulling up 1 tael. Daxingyong aggressively sold, falling to 5.5 taels. At this point, the exchange market remained tight, with all banks wanting June U.S. exchange rate at 3.75. The rush caused it to rise to 8.1 taels. Goods were taken out, dropping by 2 taels. Hengyu and Yuanchun both bought, rising to 9.5 taels. Fuchang then exited, gradually falling to 7.3 taels. The market was mediocre, hovering for a long time. Bingxing, Xinheng, and Yu all aggressively delivered bars, breaking the silence and becoming prosperous. The exchange market also tightened, with 3.125 June seemingly difficult to settle, breaking through 10 taels. Silver companies sold 3.125 June U.S. dollars to Mitsubishi. Zhifeng and Yongyuanmaoyong all came to sell off, breaking below 10 taels. But at this time, it could still be supported. When Yuanchun and Zhifengyong all sold, it dropped to 0.078 taels. However, because the banks' appetite remained stable, Anda bought June U.S. dollars at only 0.125. Yuanmaoyong suddenly came to deliver, rising again to over 10 taels, at 0.08 taels. Shengda sold off, still hovering around 10 taels. Dadecheng sold even more, dropping to below 10 taels. Goods for hedging all came to take out, falling further to 8.5 taels. Fuchang came to deliver, with retail investors pushing up the price quite strongly, gradually rising to over 10 taels, again at 0.08 taels. The trend was mostly volatile, and twists and turns arose again. Foreign telegrams indicated that U.S. Congressman Pittman proposed that the government purchase silver, and there was even news that war debts could be repaid with silver. Shunli first sold to below 10 taels. Yuanshengyong also exited to below 9 taels. A selling wave arose at once. Yuanheng also exited to around 7 taels. Although there were no transactions in the exchange market, it seemed to be hardening. Bingxing sold bars, falling even more miserably to below 5 taels, at 4.5 taels. Yuanmaoyong came to deliver, pulling up 1 tael. In the absence of a similar human, the heart turns vain, retail investors are numerous, at this point they have turned to be short, all sell and lower the price, the exchange market is also loose, Hengyu Yuanshengyong again sell short, still see the lower reaches, Qingfayong also comes to sell off, then falls to 02.3 taels, this time has been forced to close the market, the pullers are also crowded, struggling for a long time, the pull up seen two years, the closing then as 703.5 taels, after closing the Hengyu sell not stop, still come to sell off, continued to fall to two, the thing so shooted 2. Survey half an hour extremely average, the rise and fall is not big, the trend is still fine, measure the highest price is seven hundred and eleven and a half, the lowest price is seven hundred and two and three money, have nine and two money differ, as a result than before closing and see the rise of six eight money, this month register seven hundred and twenty-six, in April 704, subsidy seven hundred and twenty-four.</p>
<p>The indoor transaction has not seen prosperity, comprehensive plan, Yuanyong Honglifuyu Yuanmaoyong Hengxingyuan Xiexingyong Hengyu, etc., are all living in the buyer Bixing Yuanchun Daxingyong Shunli Yuanshengyong Yuanheng Fuchang Ruixing Wanxing are the seller, Zhaofengchang Ruikangxinyi, etc., really in the first, silent in the back, Dalian Gang slightly out, Guang Gang Hengxing still no transaction, Shengda into and out are not many, half an hour system count transaction is extremely little,</p>
<p>The baked red has not yet been made, buy each form of observation, also no certain standard, called price generally according to add at the thirty or so, market conditions extremely shape cold light, as to the term standard swap spot deal is not many, stick price is more fierce than before, Ke Gang slightly some to do,</p>
<p>Swap still high, March and April initially turned out by the short side Ruikang subsidy 25, counted to subsidize the Da Shun Dafengheng 14, wish to swap out quite a few, cover this price really has made the spot number satisfied, so into the back Yingfenghang subsidy to Dafengheng 14, has been 20, Dadecheng subsidy to Runchangyu ninety-one is 19,</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Market Remains Peaceful</h3>

The local recent British exchange rate opened at 1 shilling 9 pence and the U.S. exchange rate at 32.25 yuan, tighter than the previous close at 0.0625 (British exchange rate) and 0.125 (U.S. exchange rate). After opening, it was peaceful, with shilling buyers plentiful. The exchange rate listing was announced, and shillings showed little movement, appearing slightly subdued. As soon as the gold market opened, it rose, and the exchange market also tightened. However, U.S. dollar transactions seemed scarce. June U.S. dollars initially traded at 33.625 yuan, gradually tightening after entering. Initially, Anda ate 0.5 yuan, then 0.3, dug 3.125, and even went to 0.125. At this time, the whole generation stopped, and was still for a long time, the American government proposed three points, favorable to the silver, and to the of white war, the result how, is still hard to, gold because to fall, has less deal, but the trend is along to, lack deal at this time to receive the market.

<h3>Security Bond Prices Continue to Rise by 0.3-0.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Aviation Donation of Two Points per 10,000 Tael Collected Starting Today</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the bond trend remained firm. Although news from North China was very serious, with the departure of Zhang and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in charge of everything, the prospects for the war were perhaps more secure. Short sellers in the market still covered their positions, and Northern interests also made purchases. However, trading was even less active than before. Before the opening of the morning session, the atmosphere in the market seemed more tense. At the opening auction, the market was quite calm and rose slightly by 0.2-0.3 yuan. However, the consolidated salt tax fell slightly by 0.2-0.3 yuan due to some long positions unwinding. In the second session, it eased by about 0.1 yuan. The market was extremely firm, and the salt tax rebounded by about 0.1 yuan, seeming to be brewing a recovery. In the afternoon, short sellers still unwound positions, and Northern interests even increased their appetite. However, trading was not active. Both sessions rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The closing salt tax was quite firm. Overall, the day's trend can be described as firm. Both long and short sides were still observing and holding their positions. If there are no special changes in North China, the future of market prices should gradually become optimistic. Yesterday's market price results continued to rise by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The total turnover was 5,212,000 yuan, of which 2,000 yuan were in spot goods. The futures salt tax was more active, but only 1,410,000 yuan. There were 100,000 yuan in troop reduction bonds, only 700,000 yuan in consolidated tax bonds, and about 300-500,000 yuan each in the remaining bonds. There were only 200,000 yuan in 1898 customs bonds and the various "gold long five" bonds combined. The exchange also announced that starting today, an aviation surcharge of 2 points per 10,000 yuan will be collected.</p>
<h3>The Economic Situation During the American Bank Holiday</h3>
<p>The New F丰洋行 reports: Since the nationwide bank holiday, stock exchanges in various locations have also uniformly suspended trading. Brokers at the New York Stock Exchange, as usual, were prohibited from buying and selling securities registered with the exchange. Consequently, over-the-counter trading emerged spontaneously. Speculators gathered in the Wall Street area to cover short positions, causing the grey market to be unusually firm. Simultaneously, brokers received piles of purchase orders with high bids. According to speculators, a short squeeze is inevitable when the exchange reopens. The grey market for commodities also experienced a sharp rise. Cotton has surged by two cents, raw silk by about twenty or thirty pounds, and sugar by twenty pounds. On Thursday, Handy &amp; Harman quoted silver at three 角, an increase of about three 分 from the previous price. Furthermore, the chairman of the Federal Agricultural Administration announced that the 全数平准公司 had completely divested its entire holdings. 期麦 has also decreased by 30,391,000 蒲式耳, while all棉花 has been transferred to the Red Cross. From now on, the prices of 平准棉花 and 小麦 will no longer be calculated.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's credit expansion is enormous. The figures are as follows (unit: millions of gold dollars):</p>
<p>|               | Reserve Banks March 1st | March 8th |</p>
<p>|---------------|------------------------|-----------|</p>
<p>| Bill Purchases | 3--317                 |           |</p>

<p>Cash reserves decreased from $4,344,000,000 to $4,243,000,000. The reserve ratio decreased from 53.5% to 45.6%. The credit expansion is evident.</p>
<p>In terms of commerce, the banking crisis has had a significant impact. In the week of March 4th, steel production was at 15%, a decrease of 2% from the previous week. From February 18th to 25th, the number of railway freight cars was 459,100, a decrease of 55,300 cars from the previous week.</p>
<h3>The Rise in Cotton Yarn Prices Drives Up High-Count Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market is firming due to the rise in raw cotton prices, which has stimulated the sluggish yarn market. However, actual demand remains weak, and activity is slow across all guilds. This is due to tight credit, weak purchasing power, and increasing inventories in factories. Nevertheless, some believe that rising prices in the United States will encourage more buying. However, judging from the overall situation, the future cannot be viewed with excessive optimism.</p>
<p>人標 Advances Slightly. At the opening of the previous 人標 market, sentiment was extremely weak. Later, due to the rise of 8 罗比 in Indian cotton and an increase in the cotton market, the yarn market was stimulated, with prices rising by 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 钱 across all months. However, spot yarn business remains sluggish. In the afternoon, prices for all months rose by another 1, 2, and 3 钱. Total transaction volume for the day was 18,600 bales. Sales included 750 bales of 裕康, 600 bales of 明德, 550 bales of 益昶, 500 bales of 賡豐, 550 bales of 仁豐, and 500 bales of 新華. Purchases included 1,750 色 of 椿記, 400 bales of 瑞大, 800 bales of 愼記, 1,850 bales of 長豐, and 400 bales of 穗隆. Closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|-------|---------------|--------|---------------|</p>
<p>| June  | 1438          | Up 3   | 31,300        |</p>
<p>| March | 1398          | Up 5   | 27,850        |</p>
<p>| July  | 1446          | Up 3   | 23,250        |</p>
<p>| April | 1413          | Up 7   | 44,900        |</p>
<p>| August| 1455          | Up 6   | 7,350         |</p>
<p>| May   | 1427          | Up 9   | 41,200        |</p>
<p>| Total |               |        | 175,850       |</p>
<p>Spot Demand Remains Sluggish As Before</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Daily purchases by all guilds totaled 431 bales, with prices firming by 2.5 钱. Purchases by each guild were as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 50, Guangdong 60, Jiujiang 3, Fujian 7, Shantou 80</p>
<p>Luzhou 80, Inland 86, Ningbo 5, Zhenjiang 10, Fellow Traders 50</p>
<p>Yarn Inventory Nears 30,000 Pieces</p>
<p>The warehouse of the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange holds 28,000 pieces of yarn, mostly 22-count 人鐘, 採花, and 龍船 yarn. There is also some 16-count 天津三印, 松鹤, and 20-count 鹤 yarn.</p>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a strong rise due to the increase of 8 罗比 in Indian cotton and the rebound in gold prices, which is causing anxiety. Large speculators are also making new purchases, anticipating that American cotton may rise by over 200 pounds. Consequently, they are absorbing the far months. However, as prices rise, exchange rates will inevitably increase, and various countries are concerned about overproduction and are seeking ways to promote sales. As for our country's yarn mills, their business is declining and their finances are dwindling. Mills have no need to purchase high-priced raw materials, suggesting that there may be a major shift in the future.</p>
<p>郑標 Has New Bulls</p>
<p>At the opening of the previous 郑標 market, prices rose by 3-4 钱 following the increase in foreign cotton. 邵边 and two other individuals made speculative purchases of about 10,000 bales, sweeping the 面 dry. In the afternoon, market sentiment remained firm. One manufacturer planned to release 1,000 bales per month from April onward, but the situation remained tight. Prices for all months rose by 5 分 to 1.5 钱. Total transaction volume for the day was 81,400 bales. Sales included 3,100 bales of 信诚, 1,600 bales of 明德, 2,500 bales of 大昶, 2,400 bales of 源大, 5,300 bales of 益豐, 1,700 bales of 森康, 1,400 bales of 益昶, and 1,300 bales of 愼昌. Purchases included 7,100 bales of 瑞大, 4,300 bales of 椿記, 2,000 bales of 賡豐, 3,500 bales of 遠大, 4,400 bales of 崇安, 4,100 bales of 餘昶, and 2,300 bales of 長和. Closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|-------|---------------|--------|---------------|</p>
<p>| June  | 3250          | Up 5   | 77,400        |</p>
<p>| March | 3160          | Up 3   | 68,000        |</p>
<p>| July  | 3265          | Up 4   | 80,500        |</p>

<p>| Total |               |        | 441,800       |</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Mill Appetite Is Shallow</p>
<p>Spot cotton business is minimal, and mills are only making small purchases. On the 9th, 1,000 pieces of Indian cotton 平果尔 were shipped, which were mistakenly recorded as having been purchased by 恒豐廠 at 97 taels per piece. This is hereby corrected. The cotton was actually purchased by 伟通厂.</p>
<p>陕西 Cotton at 31.50 was purchased by 振泰厂, one piece of spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>太仓 Cotton at 31.00 was purchased by 振新厂, 300 bales, and also Wuxi.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Will Rise Due to Inflation</h3>
<p>Currently Closed Due to Financial Crisis</p>
<p>A New York telegram dated the 10th reports on the cotton market for the past week: Last week, cotton trading was restricted due to a lack of hedging, bank closures, and the absence of foreign exchange markets. It is expected that inflation will have a positive impact on棉价. Cotton goods are therefore expected to be in high demand. The market may therefore thrive, though speculative activity is undoubtedly present. Nevertheless, inquiries from factories for spot cotton have been stimulated, and there have been a few transactions at prices between 7.25 and 8 cents. There are also other small-scale transactions being discussed, with prices to be determined after the futures market reopens. Mr. Smiths' proposal to reduce 棉产 this year will be resubmitted to the Senate.</p>

<h3>The Grain Transport Strike Shows Signs of Resolution; The Number of Rice Boats Arriving Downriver Gradually Increases</h3>

The future trend will depend on the trends in the United States to determine whether prices will rise or fall.

<h3>The Death of Takiji Kobayashi</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tianyi</p>
<p>A [friend of mine] in Tokyo wrote, [Takiji Kobayashi was beaten to death alive by the police]. The time was February 20, 1933. The letter did not give details because he feared censorship there. I翻 even flipped through Japanese newspapers, but I didn’t see any records. The Japanese authorities’ [tight control] over this matter is conceivable.</p>
<p>This isn't entirely unexpected. Takiji Kobayashi has always been a bit [restless]. Recently, he joined many others in opposing the invasion of China and opposing imperialism. It is not surprising that he was beaten to death by the Japanese police.</p>
<p>But Japan is a [rule-of-law country], so one can't help but have some thoughts.</p>
<p>Yet another but, since Japan has a government, shouldn’t the Japanese government [have the right to protect itself and suppress those movements that endanger itself]?</p>
<p>However, they are still not thorough. They are still so embarrassed about the exercise of this [should-have] right, and they still need to be [tightly controlled].</p>
<p>This is because they have reservations.</p>
<p>They invade China and massacre the Chinese people, saying it's for their so-called lifeline, that they are finding a way out for all their people. However, they are constantly having troubles domestically. This time it is the death of Takiji Kobayashi. This tells us that not only is the Chinese nation persecuted and massacred, but there are also people in their own country who are persecuted and massacred for opposing the invasion of China and for opposing imperialism. So, whose lifeline is the so-called lifeline? This not only deceives others, but even the Japanese people of the Yamato race cannot be deceived. This is what they are worried about.</p>
<p>However, they can no longer deceive.</p>
<p>Ah, this is his true face.</p>
<h3>Japan Riding On The Horse's Head</h3>
<p>— Translated by Kuiming</p>
<p>The Japan Chronicle on March 2 carried a conversation by　伯讷 when he was talking about Sino-Japanese, the League of Nations, and nationalism. A translated excerpt is as follows.</p>
<p>When reporters met with Shaw, someone asked: [Mr. Shaw, do you agree with Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations?]</p>
<p>Shaw scolded the League of Nations head-on, saying: [You ask me if I agree with Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations? What does Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations have to do with me? Japan has already decided, Japan has already destroyed the League of Nations, and has already proved the League of Nations' uselessness. You also know that the activities of the League of Nations have two aspects: On the one hand, the League of Nations Secretariat handles diplomatic affairs. It only knows how to hold meetings, discuss, report, and the world rarely pays attention. I once attended a general assembly, but I never dared to try a second time. Because it can only discuss and plan to prevent a certain event from happening. The other aspect of the League of Nations' activities is the International Labor Bureau. This organization is a rather illegal organization, but its work is still somewhat satisfactory.]</p>
<p>Shaw continued: [Since you have already overthrown one aspect, then you should destroy it all together. When you started attacking China, when you broke the covenant, the League of Nations should have done something, it should have sanctioned you long ago; but it didn't do anything, and it didn't even think of doing anything. Its member states only sold military equipment to China and Japan, and it is still like this now. Your war against China this time does not need to use samurai spirit to defeat China. Military equipment alone is enough to win. The old-fashioned reckless glory is over, and infantry is not as useful as it was at the beginning of the European war. At that time, the infantry was only used as a kind of most ridiculous massacre; no, you are attacking them with modern weapons. If they also have them and can use them, then they will attack you too. You say that all this is self-defense, that your fighting is self-defense, then all wars can be said to be self-defense. I am an Irishman. Ireland has about four million people, while England has forty million people, but the English people can never make the Irish people forget their own nationality, even though the English people have exhausted iron and blood, burning and killing to suppress the Irish people. Manchuria has thirty million Chinese people, how can you subdue them? You cannot oppress them with the police. In any case, the police are useless, completely ineffective, unless the people need them, then they are useful. But the Chinese people do not need them now, so a question arises: Are you prepared to suppress them by force for the next hundred years?] Shaw said to the reporters again that he is now seventy years old. When he was young, England still used horses as transport, but sometimes the horse slipped on the road, [What is the reason for this? This is because everyone likes to sit on the horse's head, but the saddle and the gun make it uncomfortable, so it kicks up and slips to the ground. You suppress the rise of nationalism, as if you were sitting on the horse's head, so you can't do anything else. The Irish have prevented the British Parliament from doing anything for more than thirty years, discussing the Irish problem all day long. If you sit on that horse's head in the next century, what will you encounter? Who will you call to do it? And can this thing be done? I think your nationalists and patriots are unwilling to do it, because they are busy discussing it! Only 貨 fools will国家 nationalism, only 货 fools are talking about their historical freedom and glory. When you finally get the strongest country, you will immediately need to shoot your nationalists. But at this time, you have done nothing, do you have a long-term vision for this matter? Conquering China, what do you think Japan will become? It is inevitable that the Chinese will continue to rise up to争门, and finally you will think of using one policeman to monitor one Chinese person.</p>
<p>When Shaw spoke so loudly, the reporters were dumbfounded and stopped writing. At this time, the time Shaw had agreed upon for the conversation had already exceeded, and the audience was watching him, seeming to indicate that he was old, impolite, and not worthy of lecturing. But he said [You see me as very rude, but if I were only twenty years old, I would not be so frank.] At that time, someone mentioned [bushido], and Shaw said [What does bushido mean? Is it what you call patriotism? But a patriot who makes himself and his country ridiculous should mostly be shot.]</p>
<p>Shaw continued to ask a few questions and said [What religion do you believe in? You are journalists, so of course you don't believe in religion, but what religion do the people of Beppu believe in? Do they still believe in Buddhism, or do they believe in Shintoism, or some other religion? I think all religions have a little truth, so I believe in them all. But now all religions are corrupt, just like Buddhism is no longer true Buddhism. You just sculpt an Indian Buddha statue to deceive others and beg him. What did I see in Japan? I didn't see anything at all. I didn't want to see anything to begin with. I came here by accident. I wanted to take a long voyage, so I boarded this ship, but this ship came here again, and I couldn't help it.]</p>
<h3>A Black Woman's Quest for God (25)</h3>
<p>— Authored by George Bernard Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>["He's a poet, I think,"] said the sculptor.</p>
<p>The Arab, interrupted in this way, flushed red; he stood up abruptly and drew his knife. ["Do you</p>
<p>think I am a ballad singer?"] he said. ["This insult must be washed away with blood."]</p>
<p>["I beg your pardon,"] said the sculptor. ["I didn't mean to offend you. Why are you ashamed of creating a song that lasts longer than a person's life, but not ashamed of creating a corpse? After a corpse is created, it must be hidden in the ground to avoid defiling the dead."]</p>
<p>["True,"] said the Arab, as he put away his weapon and sat down again. ["Whenever 　 a mean man composes impure poems, God sends a sacred song to cleanse it, which is also one of God's mysteries. However, I am an honest camel driver who never sings songs for money,"], though to be honest, I also like to sing."</p>
<p>["As for me, I am not overly righteous,"] said the sorcerer. ["People call me a chatterbox and a drunkard. I do not fast. I violate the Sabbath. I have always been friendly with unruly women. I am disobedient to my mother and abandon my home: why? Because the true family of man is the kind of family where God is the father, and we are all his daughters: not petty families and shops, where people are weaned and leave their mothers' sides."]</p>
<p>["To avoid spiritual constraints, one must have many wives and a large family,"] said the Arab. ["He should distribute his love. He will only know who is valuable when he has known many women, because value is a matter of comparison. I only knew how much of an old angel my first wife was when I discovered what a little devil my last wife was."]</p>
<p>["Then, what about your wives?"] said the Black woman. ["Shouldn't they also know many men, so that they can understand your value?"]</p>
<p>["God protect me from this black daughter of Satan,"] the Arab said sternly. ["Woman, you must know that whenever men are talking, and the topic is knowledge, you should be quiet. God created man before he created woman."]</p>
<p>["Think carefully,"] said the Black woman. ["If what you say is true, then God must have created woman because he felt that man was incomplete. By what right do you demand fifty wives and punish them with only one husband?"]</p>
<p>["If I were to be reborn,"] said the Arab. ["I would become a celibate monk, open the door and never see women, and never be in the same room with women. But think about it. If I only had one wife, then the other women would not get any of me, even though many women long for me in proportion to my excellence and their discernment. A discerning woman, longing for her children to have the best father, would rather have one-fiftieth of me than the whole of a smelly carcass. Why should she suffer this kind of unnecessary injustice?"]</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Rural Life</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuiyun</p>
<p>The Pirates of Tai Lake</p>
<p>When it comes to the pirates of Tai Lake, everyone feels a little uneasy. Stories of steamboats being robbed and villages being plundered are often reported in the newspapers. Those who don't know the details may think that they occupy mountain strongholds, almost like the heroes of Liangshan Marsh, relying on dangerous terrain to defend themselves, and the government troops dare not attack them; and they spend their whole lives as pirates, always living together in the stronghold except when they come out to rob.</p>
<p>In fact, it's not like that. Although there are ["seventy-two peaks"] in Tai Lake, places like Dongting Mountain and Maji Mountain are covered with fruit trees and forests, and the fields are full of mulberry and hemp, so there are quite a few residents. Places like Jue Mountain and Ze Mountain also have people living there, with hundreds of households in some places and dozens in others. Some mountain valleys are connected to fish ponds, lotus root ponds, gorgon fruit fields, and mulberry dikes, clearly fishing villages and water towns, or even what could be described as ["Shangri-La"]. They don't look like mountain strongholds at all. Moreover, there is no single peak or mountain that can be defended by relying on its dangerous terrain. Even if there were such a fixed place to gather, wouldn't it be easy to wipe them out after being besieged by airplanes and cruisers!</p>
<p>So, what do they rely on for their existence and activities? It turns out that they use the complex and intricate harbors and waterways. They have no walls, no strongholds, and not even a fixed group. Many tenants living in the mountains and bays along Tai Lake, who usually live a hard life by farming and fishing, have the possibility of joining. All it takes is for the big boss to start it, and then the small bosses to carry out activities separately, making contact in the small teahouses in the villages, and then small groups can be formed into medium-sized groups, and medium-sized groups can be combined into large gangs, distributing the guns that have been buried in advance, and it is not difficult to attack large towns, let alone intercept steamboats. After the robbery is over, the spoils are divided, and except for the big boss who stays in the city as a ["rich man"], the rest all disperse and return to their original places as ["good citizens"], looking just like other law-abiding people.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Today is the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. The whole city lowered its flags to half-mast and stopped entertainment and business. Many people went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects. (12th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the memorial ceremony for the eighth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death on the twelfth, Ju Zheng, the chairman, performed the ceremony and presented wreaths. Then Sun Ke gave a report, saying that it has been eight years since Dr. Sun Yat-sen passed away. We should examine how much of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the Three Principles of the People have been implemented in the past eight years, in order to determine the direction of our efforts in the future. In the past, regarding the issue of abolishing unequal treaties, in addition to the declaration of tariff autonomy and the recovery of two or three concessions, other issues such as consular jurisdiction have not been fully resolved, and the lost territories in the Northeast have not been recovered. Secondly, issues such as local self-government, training the people to exercise the four rights, and controlling capital, equalizing land rights, and industrial plans have not been completed. We should apologize to Dr. Sun Yat-sen for this. In the future, we should make the greatest determination and double our efforts to seek practical results. Today, when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we should not forget the comrades who are killing the enemy at the front. The war has not yet ended. In this time of sorrow, we should muster our courage, emulate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of indomitable struggle, and shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country. We must not be discouraged by minor setbacks, let alone have a national subjugation mentality. We should lead the people and be the backing of the armed comrades. (12th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:00, all the members of the Central Committee visited the mausoleum. Yu Youren presided over the ceremony. The sound film was shot by the Mingxing Film Company in Shanghai and will be taken to the front for screening. Chairman Lin gave a speech, saying to our dearest frontline soldiers, you are fighting desperately with the enemy at the front. Everyone admires your courage and spirit. You know that the enemy is destroying international conventions, disregarding justice, forcibly occupying our land, and killing our people. We have been忍無可忍 intolerable and have to implement resistance and self-defense. We want to kill the enemy and recover our land. We want you frontline soldiers to strive to the end, because this is fighting for the dignity of the Chinese nation, fighting for the international status of the country, and fighting for world peace. It is very valuable and glorious. I hope you will work hard to advance, kill the enemy, and recover our land. (12th, special dispatch)</p>

Officials from military and political departments and staff members of the government, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and delivered the following speech: Everyone, today is the eighth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. We feel very sad today. The meaning of holding this memorial ceremony is nothing more than to admire virtue and repay merit, but we must continue all of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's work and earnestly implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, so that we do not lose the meaning of commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen today. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen is not here today, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles have been deeply imprinted in our people, especially in our comrades. Therefore, everyone should fully accept the Three Principles of the People and carry forward the Three Principles of the People, so that we can be worthy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Today, in our grief, we must not forget what Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us when he was dying, which is to strive peacefully to save China. Originally, our Chinese nation is extremely peaceful, but because of various relations with the environment and internationally, we must strive ourselves. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are to achieve world harmony. What we want to strive for today is not only to save China, but also to seek world peace. We must keep these words in mind at all times in the future and strive to practice them, so that the principles can be promoted.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Representatives Engage in a Great Verbal Battle on London Radio</h3>
<p>Guo Taiqi Appeals Loudly</p>
<p>Hoping for Moral Support from Britain</p>
<p>Matsuoka Utters Wild Fallacies</p>
<p>Obscuring Military Aggression</p>
<p>(London) Today, anyone equipped with a radio could hear the broadcast speeches of Matsuoka, the Japanese representative to Geneva, and Guo Taiqi, the Chinese envoy to London. Matsuoka claimed that Manchuria was the cornerstone of the Far East issue, so Japan could not allow people who hated Japan to govern it. This was not only a matter of life and death for Japan, but also a matter of avoiding division and chaos in the Far East. Japan's inability to raise the Manchurian issue in the League of Nations was like Britain's inability to raise the Shanghai case in 1927. The development of Manchuria was due to Japan's initiative and its undertakings. The League of Nations did not seriously oppose Japanese troops assisting the illegal elements in Manchuria in clearing the north. Therefore, he could not understand why the League of Nations opposed Japan performing the same work in Rehe, because Rehe was a part of Manchuria. Facts gradually proved the of Japan's actions in Manchuria. The State of Manchuria is now on its way to achieving its hopes. Japan's sole purpose is to restore peace in East Asia and maintain it.</p>
<p>In his broadcast speech, Guo Taiqi strongly refuted the notion that Japan was a barrier to prevent communism, saying that Japan's policy was to conquer the Asian continent, and China was innocent. The Lytton Report and the League of Nations General Assembly had already made this statement. Ambassador Guo listed China's progress since 1926, saying that China was not only not anti-foreign, but also prepared to cooperate internationally with Europe and the United States. As for Japan, it was a country of chaos, and anti-foreign sentiment pervaded the country, especially in the last two years. For the benefit of Britain and Europe, Japanese aggression must be stopped. If the members of the League of Nations upheld the League Covenant, aggression could be stopped, and aggression would also stop itself. The Chinese people hoped that Britain would set an example to the world by first refusing the Japanese militarists the materials needed for their war. Britain only needs to make a moral appeal, and refusing diplomatic, financial, and commercial assistance to the aggressor country can eliminate the war in the Far East today, and perhaps eliminate all kinds of wars in the future. (12th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke arrived in England from Calais, France, and arrived at Dover, England at 5:15 PM. After arriving, Matsuoka issued a statement, saying that the declaration of the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese alliance was the main reason for securing the Far East, and that the entire US fleet would continue to be stationed in the Pacific, which decision had had a negative effect on Japan and was regrettable. However, since his duties in Geneva have now ended, the above are all personal opinions. He plans to visit Manchester as a private citizen to investigate industry, and he is scheduled to take a boat via New York on Friday to return to Japan. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Tonight, the Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke and the Chinese envoy to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, both used radio broadcasts to express their views on the Sino-Japanese conflict. The broadcast locations were different, so the two did not meet. When Matsuoka arrived at the broadcast station, a group of communists took an hostile attitude towards him, but the police prevented them from approaching. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Lytton Expresses Opinions on the Arms Embargo Issue</h3>
<p>China and Japan Should Not Be Treated Equally</p>
<p>(London) Sir Lytton, chairman of the League of Nations Manchuria Inquiry Group, defended the British government's decision to ban arms shipments to both China and Japan today, stating that if one of the two countries has violated the League of Nations Covenant, the British government cannot allow arms shipments to that country. As for the other country, the situation should be mutually with the other countries and arms shipments can only be allowed after the warring parties are clearly distinguished. If this is not possible, then the arms embargo should be lifted for both countries at the same time. (27th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Red Movement Is Fierce Throughout Korea</h3>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported on February 28 that the left-wing movement in Korea has become increasingly fierce since the spring of last year due to the reactive phenomenon of the decline of the national movement. In particular, the secret work of the disguised red peasant associations that wear a legal mask on the surface, as well as the covert activities of communist university graduates who infiltrated from Russia, is very intense. Since January of this year, the movement to rebuild the Korean Communist Party has spread throughout the country. After the authorities secretly detected this, they ordered the police bureau of the governor-general, the general headquarters, and the police departments of Nanjing and two other provinces to begin large-scale operations. At the same time, all kinds of newspapers in Korea were prohibited from carrying any news. Starting in early February, after the detectives in Nanjing and two provinces gradually gained clues, it was confirmed a few days ago that a strong red cell group was lurking in the Kato rice polishing factory in Osaka, with the workers of the factory as the center. They first arrested several suspicious people. As a result of strict interrogation, they confessed that laborers in various factories in Jinming, Sichuan, Nanhai, Gucheng, and Masan in Qingnan Province, and in Gyeonggi Province, were in contact with each other and were about to launch a . The Qingnan Provincial Police Authorities urgently coordinated with the police bureaus in various districts and Gyeonggi Province to arrest several leaders. Other important figures are still under investigation because the full situation is not yet clear.</p>
<h3>European Politicians Will Gather in Geneva</h3>
<p>The Complex and Mixed Political Situation in Europe Needs to Be Resolved Urgently</p>
<p>The British Prime Minister Meets with Various Representatives to Discuss the Far East Issue</p>
<p>Reuters, London, November 11 In the coming weeks, European politicians will gather in Geneva to hold secret meetings, not only to discuss ways to save the disarmament conference, but also to involve the political situation in Europe. What France is most concerned about now is the affairs of the Strasbourg district. Yesterday, several members of the National Socialist Party stormed into the demilitarized zone and occupied the Strasbourg City Hall and the barracks on the Rhine River. The German authorities later made some explanations for this, but it is not yet certain whether the French government is satisfied. The Strasbourg incident is generally considered to be harmful to the prospects of the disarmament conference. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini now intends to go to Geneva to support British Prime Minister MacDonald, because the Fascist Party is quite uneasy about the growing power of German Chancellor Hitler, who has appointed an administrative committee to subdue the governments of Bavaria and Luxembourg. In addition, Poland, due to the unstable situation in Danzig, has sent troops to gather in Gdynia. Germany has now asked the League of Nations to stop it. Therefore, there are many things that the politicians in Geneva should do in the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, November 11 Since arriving here, British Prime Minister MacDonald has been very busy, meeting separately with Czech representative Benes, disarmament conference chairman Henderson, Italian representative Aloisi, US representative Wilson, and Greek representative Politis. It is reported that MacDonald discussed the Far East situation, disarmament issues, and the Far East arms embargo with various representatives. The general public here believes that the prospects of the disarmament conference are pessimistic. The disarmament conference has now reached a stage of complete breakdown, and it will be impossible to avoid collapse without bold remedial measures.</p>
<h3>Important Belgian Members of Parliament Advocate Recognizing the Soviet Union of Chengde</h3>

<h3>Russian Reactionary Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Destroying Agricultural Areas and Causing Famine</p>
<p>Thirty-Five Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Moscow, 12th (TASS) - Those arrested for the anti-revolutionary conspiracy to destroy agricultural fields have now been convicted. Twenty-five were sentenced to death, twenty-two to ten years of imprisonment, and eighteen to eight years of imprisonment. The death sentences have been carried out. This news was announced in a notice signed by the Chairman of the State Political Department, Mr. Machinsky. According to the notice, all the convicts were from landlord bourgeois backgrounds and were employed by the Agricultural Commission and state agricultural field committee agencies. Their crimes involved organizing anti-revolutionary activities in the agricultural areas of Ukraine, North Caucasus, and Belarus, damaging locomotives and other agricultural machinery, disrupting sowing and harvesting plans to cause agricultural disasters. The court especially sentenced the thirty-five most active individuals among them to the highest social protection penalty, namely the death penalty. These thirty-five individuals include Ko Nar, Kozni Yu Fu, Kli Men Ni Tsz Ki, Luo Te Ni Fu, and Ti Li, among others.</p>
<h3>German Socialist Party Fully Suppresses Political Enemies</h3>
<p>Banning Communist Representatives from Attending Parliament</p>
<p>Munich, 11th (Reuters) - The National Socialist Party has taken control of the State of Bavaria, so its political enemies are now suffering harsh treatment from the Brownshirt comrades. The Bavarian Interior Minister, Si Tu Tsz Er, was broken into his home at 2:00 AM this morning, dragged out, barefoot and wearing only his nightclothes and an outer coat, and ridiculed by the crowd. The leader of the People's Party, Xia Fo, also received similar treatment. Simultaneously, Communists and Socialists are being arrested everywhere, and newspapers are being forced to cease publication. National Socialist Party leader Dr. Fo Li Ke stated in Frankfurt today that dozens of Communists have been arrested and must perform hard labor in detention. Communist representatives are not allowed to attend Parliament.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Reuters) - After the formal opening ceremony of this session of Parliament at the Potsdam Church, a representatives' meeting will be held at the Grand Theater. None of the Communist members of Parliament have been invited. According to sources within the Parliament, if Communist members of Parliament forcibly attempt to enter, they will be arrested. Parliament is meeting in the theater this time because the Parliament building was recently damaged by fire and will take several months to repair.</p>

<h3>Earthquake Hits U.S. West Coast Twenty-Three Times</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Dead and Four Thousand Injured</p>
<p>Los Angeles Turned into a Field of Rubble</p>
<p>Government Efforts in Disaster Relief Work</p>
<p>Los Angeles, 11th (Reuters) - The entire state of California, from the Mexican border to Santa Barbara, has suffered twenty-three earthquakes this time. However, the number of deaths and injuries is not as high as initially expected. According to local authorities, a total of 139 people have died and over 4,000 have been injured, but most of the injuries are minor. The first earthquake was felt on Friday afternoon, followed by continuous aftershocks at night and on Saturday morning. It is now believed that the epicenter is located in the uplift in the South Pacific Ocean in the Long Beach area. Initial reports indicated that over 500 people were killed or injured in the Long Beach area, but it is now known that only 65 people were. Long Beach is unusually peaceful this morning and is now under partial martial law. Although there have been occasional small tremors today, they have caused no damage. Furthermore, the disaster victims have experienced major earthquakes for days, so they are not concerned about minor tremors. Thousands of men, women, and children are wrapped in blankets and lying in ballparks or open spaces to avoid the danger of collapsing buildings. However, there are only a few reports of a lack of food and water so far. Anaheim Street, about two miles long, leading to the residential area of Long Beach, has been severely damaged after the earthquake, with almost no intact houses on either side. However, post-disaster work began immediately, and 2,000 workers are now clearing the streets. Approximately 3,000 people were injured in Los Angeles. Many brick walls have collapsed, and many houses have been cracked. The newly built City Hall has also been damaged. The Washington government has approved local banks to lend the necessary funds for disaster relief. If continued assistance is needed, it will be allocated by the Treasury Department. The President of the National Red Cross, Fei Si, telegraphed Governor Luo Er, offering to have the Red Cross manage the disaster relief work. The extent of the damage varies from place to place. For example, 13 people died and 150 people were injured in [Ke Pu blank] Town, while other [small vertical line] towns have only one death each. Efforts are still underway to search for bodies in the rubble, and it is feared that the final number of deaths will far exceed the currently confirmed 139. The number of deaths in Long Beach has reached hundreds, and smaller houses have been turned into piles of bricks and cement, under which there must be several buried bodies. Thousands of people have joined the regular army and the National Guard, fulfilling their duty to patrol and assist the disaster victims. The authorities have also sent naval ships to the affected towns. Governor Luo Er is now personally supervising the relief efforts, and planes are arriving from various places to provide assistance. Another tragic incident occurred today. A plane that came to help the disaster victims crashed outside Long Beach due to heavy fog, killing all three people on board. Although there have been several earthquakes in recent days, the boxing matches at the Hollywood [Bi blank] Field, Dano, and Baltimore were still held as scheduled, with Dano winning. The theaters in Los Angeles and Hollywood are also open.</p>

In front of the meeting hall, there were couplets that read "[Forests are brilliant, all flowers compete for glory, gardens are quiet and secluded, all fragrant plants compete to bloom]". In the center hung the Premier's [blank] portrait, will, and the party and national flags. Order sheets and various slogans were posted on both sides. The Public Security Bureau dispatched the Second Company Commander Yuan Guo Tang to lead the team to maintain order.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Those from all walks of life who participated in the tree planting ceremony boarded the municipal ferry from the Bund on Nanjing Road to Donggou. Those who attended included Mayor Wu [blank] Cheng, Social Bureau Director Wu Xingya, Public Utilities Bureau Director Xu Peihuang, Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hong En, Finance Bureau Director Cai Zengji, Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi, Health Bureau Director Li Ting'an, Land Bureau Director Jin Liren, as well as all staff members, Liu Yide from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Zhang Tianfu from the Special District Local Court, and over a thousand teachers and students from various elementary schools such as Zhuyin, Xicheng, Shidai, Xigou, Sanxiu, Tanzhen, He'an, Bide, Wan Zhu, and various secondary schools such as Wusong, Wuben, and Yangjing.</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Meeting</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, the opening ceremony was held, presided over by Mayor Wu Tiecheng. First, the military band of the Public Security Bureau played music and paid the highest tribute to the party and national flags and the Premier's portrait. Three minutes of silence were observed to commemorate the Premier. After singing the tree planting song, the Chairman delivered a speech, and representatives from all walks of life gave speeches one after another. Tree planting began immediately and dispersed at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng said in his opening remarks, "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the eighth anniversary of the Premier's death. Sun Premier can be said to have lived for the Chinese nation and died for the Chinese nation. We who have not died should continue his unfinished business and implement the Premier's entire will one by one to achieve the goal of saving the country. Don't just talk and not do. True followers of the Premier who implement the Three Principles of the People should strive to implement the Premier's national salvation plan and national salvation plan. Therefore, on the anniversary of the Premier's death, the government has designated it as Arbor Day to promote the tree planting movement. We live in southern China, and we have not seen forests everywhere. The timber for our houses is mostly foreign goods. The reason for our continuous floods and droughts is the lack of forests. Our most forested area is the three northeastern provinces, where the huge forests cover vast areas. The timber used by the people of the Northeast is taken from the local area and does not need to be purchased from foreign countries. It is not only sufficient for local use but can also be supplied to the south. However, the three northeastern provinces have been occupied by the Japanese. Northwest forests cannot be developed and transported due to inconvenient transportation. Our country purchases approximately 14 million yuan of timber from foreign countries every year. Forests are closely related to people's health and floods and droughts. The afforestation movement should be promoted by the people of the whole country, promoting tree planting to save the country. Tree planting is also saving the country. Our 400 million people are too uncompetitive. The Japanese are small, [blank] the country is strong, and the nation is prosperous. Our country has vast land and abundant resources, but it must be utilized to be useful. We should start from developing resources in various places and strive to produce so that money does not flow out, the country can turn from weak to strong, and national humiliation can be avenged. Doing things must have a beginning and an end. I hope everyone will work hard. [blank] Pan Wang delivers a speech."</p>
<p>Next, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech, saying, "Today is the eighth anniversary of the Premier's death. The meaning of tree planting has been explained by Mayor Wu. Brothers see [blank] various slogans today, saying that tree planting can increase human health. This is indeed true because trees can harmonize the air and make people feel [blank] happy. Now, let's talk about the 'planting' character in 'tree planting.' The so-called 'straight wood can become good timber,' which is also how people should conduct themselves. But to achieve the excellent production of timber, it is necessary to protect it carefully after planting. In the era of human learning, it is necessary to increase knowledge to become a good talent for society. Therefore, tree planting and being a person are equally important. Planting more trees creates a forest, and joining people together creates a strong nation. Therefore, I hope that the teachers and students of all schools who participate today will be vigilant. The next speech was given by Wang Xia[blank], Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who said that wood becomes timber when planted, and people become useful vessels when they are upright. Therefore, planting and cultivating talent are equally important. To rescue the excellence of tree planting, it is only necessary to protect it carefully, but the cultivation of talent requires both teacher training and self-cultivation, so I hope that all of you who participate today will work harder to become great talents so that you can benefit the country. Otherwise, people may be inferior to trees."</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Convened the Eighth Anniversary of the Premier's Death</h3>
<p>Chairman [Blank] Huai Delivered a Somber Speech</p>
<p>Today is the eighth anniversary of the Premier's death. The Municipal Party Headquarters convened all sectors to hold a memorial meeting at the party headquarters auditorium on Lin[blank] Road at 9:00 AM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>In addition to the full staff of the Municipal Party Headquarters, representatives from all sectors included Zhang Mengling from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office, Gao Jie and Li Wanqing from the Third Branch of the High Court, [blank] Bingqi from the Maritime Administration, Guan Zhijiang and Deng [blank] Zhi from the First Special District Court, Zheng Letian from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Liu Bing[blank] from the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Department, Li Yongxiang from the Federation of Trade Unions, representatives from [blank] Yun Chuan [blank], cosmetics, cement, hat making, cotton spinning, military uniform, ship, wood [blank], rubber [blank] and other industry trade unions, and representatives from [blank] [blank] Wuben, Junyi, Wanzhu, Pei [blank], Bide, Yihang, He'an, Xinggong, Dongshan, Yangzhi, Dongming, Yongxing and other schools, totaling over two hundred people, presided over by Jiang Huaisu and emceed by Fan Mingyao.</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>The memorial ceremony was as follows: (1) Opening of the meeting; (2) Singing the Party Song; (3) [blank] Highest Respect to the Party and National Flags and the Premier's Portrait; (4) Chairman Respectfully Reading the Premier's Will; (5) Two Minutes of Silence; (6) Chairman's Report; (7) Speeches; (8) Slogans; (9) Ceremony Completed.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Jiang [blank] Su gave a report, saying, "The Premier left us eight years ago, and the people suddenly lost their [blank] Reliance. The words and deeds of the Premier during his lifetime are all worth remembering forever. Although the Premier has passed away for eight years, the Premier's spirit has not died. Not only has it not died, but it has become increasingly bright and [blank] Long-lasting. Now, at a time of serious national crisis, we are commemorating the Premier here. We should take the Premier's spirit of great fearlessness as our teacher. In the three minutes of silence, everyone's minds can [blank] Arise, Mr. Sun Zhongshan's spirit of hard struggle during his lifetime. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the national situation was more critical than it is now. If there had been no Premier to rise up and lead the revolution at that time, China would have been divided and co-managed long ago. How could it have been preserved to this day? Today, the people have a sense of national concept in their minds, but at that time, they only knew about their families and had no national thought. Now, to save China from danger, we should follow the Premier's will. When the September 18th Incident in Shenyang occurred, two provinces were lost in a few days. However, the people of Shanghai thought it was not in front of them and were still entertaining themselves. It is truly said that the business girls do not know the hatred of the subjugated country, and they still sing the backyard flower across the river. By the time of the January 28th Incident, the people of Shanghai were passionate because the sound of guns was near. But now, if someone tells them about the situation in the Northeast, they still cannot hear the sound of guns and have nothing to do with their hearts. It is truly said that they do not burn incense at ordinary times but embrace the Buddha's feet when they are in a hurry. But Shanghai was under airplane bombs last year, and the Northeast is now. I hope that the people of the country will work hard to save the country through aviation and [blank] Protect the government, believe in the government, and take a unified step. The next speech was given by He Wenbo from the Singapore [blank] Bookstore, and then the meeting was dismissed."</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans</p>

<h3>Japanese Envoy Ariyoshi Akira Will Visit Beijing</h3>
<p>May Depart Tonight or Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Definite Date of Return to Home Country Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>According to news from the Japanese Consul General's Office this morning, Japanese Envoy Ariyoshi Akira's request for leave to return to his home country has not yet been decided. Due to some matters, he must visit Nanjing [blank] He is expected to depart tonight or tomorrow morning, and he is expected to [blank] Stay in Beijing for five days and return to Shanghai on the 17th, and then decide the date of his return to his home country. As for whether he will raise another protest to the Chinese government, Ariyoshi since [blank] After receiving the reply from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions, but has not yet received a reply. It is expected that this matter will have to wait until Ariyoshi returns to his home country and consults with the diplomatic authorities before a decision can be made on whether to reply.</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, there are many rumors about Japanese Envoy to China Ariyoshi Akira's imminent return to his home country. According to Ariyoshi's secretary, the 3rd of April is the death anniversary of the Envoy's late mother. According to Japanese customs, there should be a memorial ceremony, so Mr. Ariyoshi plans to return to his home country before that date. He applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo for leave some time ago. He can leave Shanghai after approval, but he has not yet received a reply from Tokyo, so whether he will return to his home country and the date of departure must be determined after receiving the reply. If approved, the Envoy's duties will be temporarily assumed by the First Secretary Horiuchi during Envoy Ariyoshi's departure from Shanghai. It is also reported that the two counselors of the embassy, ​​Ari and Sumo, will return to Shanghai today after entering Beijing last week.</p>
<h3>熱河郵電被日僞攫奪</h3>
<p>Intended to Set Up a Management Bureau in Jinzhou</p>
<p>Forcing Service or Else Restraint</p>
<p>According to news from the transportation and postal sectors this morning, the postal and telecommunications of Rehe, such as Chifeng, Beipiao, Chengde, etc., have been forcibly taken over by the puppet supervisory officers dispatched by the Japanese side, together with the special commissioners dispatched by the puppet Fengtian postal and telecommunications bureaus. It is reported that the Japanese and puppet takeover methods are divided into three batches, and it is currently being discussed to establish a postal and telegraph general bureau in Jinzhou to manage the postal and telecommunications rights taken from Rehe. Moreover, during the takeover, the few staff stationed at the bureaus were quite mistreated, and they were forced to stay and serve, otherwise their movements would be restricted. The methods used were exactly the same as those used to treat the postal workers of the three northeastern provinces when the Northeast postal service was blockaded.</p>
<h3>王梅芬建議航空協會增設兒童會員</h3>
<p>Wang Meifen Suggests Adding Children's Members to the Aviation Association</p>
<p>Wang Meifen, a child from Liujia Ferry in Pudong, wrote a letter to Mayor Wu, stating that the membership fee for ordinary members of the Aviation Association is set at two yuan, which is difficult for families with many children to afford. She suggested adding children's members and reducing the membership fee so that all children in the city can have the opportunity to join the association. Mayor Wu greatly praised her and forwarded the original letter to Mr. Lin Wojing, the secretary-general of the Aviation Association, for consideration. After receiving the letter, Mr. Lin also felt that Wang's suggestion was practical and valuable. Therefore, in addition to replying to the child directly with slight modifications to the suggestion, he also intends to submit it to the next executive committee meeting for discussion. The two letters exchanged are recorded below:</p>
<p>Wang Meifen's Letter</p>
<p>Our Mayor,</p>
<p>Today, we saw in the newspaper your letter to "All the Children of the Automatic National Salvation Donation Team." We sympathize very much with your opinions. However, we know that joining the "Aviation Association" requires a membership fee of two yuan for an ordinary member. It may not seem like much for one person to join, but we have six or seven siblings in total. If we all join together, how can our parents afford this huge expense? After discussing for a day and a night, we request that the Mayor find a way to add a children's membership category to the Aviation Association, with a membership fee of half a yuan. In this way, all the children in the city can join, take unified steps, and participate in the national salvation work through aviation. We don't know what the Mayor thinks. We hope the Mayor can give us a reply, preferably disclosed in the newspaper, to attract the attention of all the children in the city. Finally, we wish the Mayor good health.</p>
<p>Lin Wojing's Reply</p>
<p>Little friend Meifen,</p>
<p>This morning, I received the letter of the ninth you sent that was forwarded from the Mayor. The association feels that the suggestion you raised about reducing membership fees for children is very practical and valuable. We will discuss it at the next executive committee meeting, and then we can publicly announce the specific measures in the newspaper. I personally have some opinions to discuss with you. You suggested reducing the children's membership fee to five mao. I think that's too little. I think we should follow the same method as the military and police, and reduce the membership fee by half, charging only one yuan. Do you think that's suitable or not? Furthermore, how old should children be to be considered children? Children over the age of thirteen will no longer be able to enjoy this benefit. Do you think this should be restricted? You siblings may as well hold another general meeting and then send me a letter for our reference. How about it? I wish you hard work, Your friend, Lin Wojing, Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association, March 11.</p>
<h3>張羣將北上謁蔣</h3>

<p>Tang Haian, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Bolaide, the tax commissioner, jointly issued Proclamation No. 1285 this morning to prohibit the transportation of coarse grains to Dalian and the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. Regarding the joint proclamation, it was ordered to temporarily prohibit the transportation of food rice to Dalian and the ports of the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, as stated in the proclamation of November 10 of last year.

<h3>不盡不實之嚇詐案</h3>
<p>An Incomplete and Untrue Extortion Case</p>
<p>竟用愛國鐵血圖名義</p>
<p>Actually Using the Name of Patriotic Iron and Blood</p>
<p>居然牽涉婦女暧昧事</p>
<p>Involving Women in Ambiguous Affairs</p>
<p>Che Mou, a Cantonese, and Lu Jinshun, along with their gang, went to the Jialiying Construction Company at No. 170 Bazilu from the 1st to the 8th of this month, and asked the manager, Tan Jienan, also a Cantonese, for a loan unsuccessfully. They then wrote a letter, using the name of the Patriotic Iron and Blood representative Xiang Wangxue Zhuo, demanding 300 yuan, and attached a carving knife. They had Ruo Bei hand it over to his mistress, Wu Xiaohong, to intimidate them into paying. Ignoring the demand, they went to make a fuss again at about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. The Hongkou Police Department was notified, and detectives Chen Xikang and Cai Qi secretly arrested Zhuo and Lu. Together with the threatening letter and the murder weapon, they were taken to the police station and detained. This morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianpei stated that he was filing a public prosecution in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations for Punishing Bandits. According to Zhuo Xiang's confession at the police station, he had been having an affair with the plaintiff's wife, surnamed Wu, for two years. However, Wu actually married the plaintiff last winter and abandoned him. When he was in love with Wu, he gave her a pair of pillows and a stove, which she has not returned. Therefore, he and the second defendant, Lu Jinshun, went to her repeatedly to demand them back. He denied that the threatening letter was written by him, but by a friend named Lu Feng. However, he said that he drafted the content. However, when asked whether Wu had a relationship with him in the past, resulting in him demanding the pillows and stove back, the plaintiff claimed it was untrue. The police instructed detectives to arrest the person who wrote the letter, but to no avail. The threatening letter and the murder weapon were presented for inspection. Then, the plaintiff Tan Jienan stated that he did not know the two defendants at all. Although his wife, Wu, was not his legal wife, she did not have an ambiguous relationship with the defendants. He said that the first time they wrote, they said, "Your current situation is very good. I want to help you with Yuan Tou." He tore up the letter. After a few days, they came repeatedly and gave the threatening letter and the murder weapon to his wife, saying, "Is your husband willing to pay? If not, we will show you what's what." Unable to bear it, he gave them three yuan, which they refused to accept and left angrily. Therefore, he reported to the police and had the two defendants arrested. His wife, Wu Xiaohong, stated that she had never met the defendants before. It was indeed the defendant Zhuo Xiang who gave her the threatening letter and the murder weapon. At that time, she slammed the knife hard on Zhuo, scaring her three-year-old child into getting sick. When questioned, Zhuo Xiang confessed that he did have an affair with Wu in the past. Now that she is with the plaintiff, he went to demand the pillows and stove back. He denied everything else, saying that the confession at the police station was all nonsense. Lu Jinshun confessed that he went to the plaintiff's house with Zhuo Xiang to retrieve the above-mentioned items. The plaintiff agreed to give them two yuan, but Zhuo Xiang thought it was too little, and they quarreled. He was evasive about the rest. Judge Fen instructed that they should be remanded in custody and await sentencing on a fixed date.</p>
<h3>施柏生跌傷斃命</h3>
<p>Shi Guisheng Collected the Coffin for Burial</p>
<p>Shi Baisheng, a local, 38 years old, had been working as a carpenter in the Gongda Construction Factory. Recently, the Municipal Council contracted the construction of a small vegetable market on Xiaoshadu Road to the construction factory. The day before yesterday morning, when the workers were working, Shi was working on the top floor of the market. It happened to be raining that day, and there was no cover on the top, making it very slippery. Shi accidentally slipped and fell down, suffering serious injuries at the time and losing consciousness. His cousin, Shi Lisheng, noticed him and immediately reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, ordering detective Zhao Bing to investigate. The injured person was sent to Tonglong Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, came to the morgue to examine the body. He sat in court and interrogated Shi Lisheng, who stated that the deceased was his cousin. He was also working there that day. He fell accidentally, and no one bumped into him on the lower level. According to the corpse Shi Guisheng, Prosecutor Guo determined that the deceased Shi Baisheng had died from a fall during his lifetime. The corpse was handed over to his brother Shi Guisheng to collect the coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Six buildings at Nos. 190-195 Wufu Lane, Nanjing Road, and two houses at Nos. 1145 and 1146 Beijing Road, are all the property of the old woman Cheng Zhang. The woman died last summer. Her eldest son, Lvping, and grandson, Deqing, believe that the property should be inherited by them. However, all the documents for the houses were given to her daughter and son-in-law Xi Zengrong for safekeeping by Cheng Zhang. They have repeatedly negotiated to get them back without success. Now, Cheng Shen, Cheng Deqing's mother, in her capacity as legal guardian, hired lawyer Chi Ping to file a lawsuit against her uncle-in-law Xi Zengrong and his son Xi Shun, requesting the court to confirm that they have a one-half inheritance right to the two properties. Yesterday, Judge Luo Chongtai of the First Special District Local Court held a hearing. According to the plaintiff Cheng Shen, Cheng Zhang was her mother-in-law, and Lvping was her eldest uncle. Her husband, Lvfu, had passed away long ago, leaving only one son, Deqing. After her mother-in-law passed away last year, the property should be inherited equally by her eldest uncle and her son. However, the deeds are in the possession of her uncle-in-law. Although her aunt has been dead for more than twenty years, her uncle-in-law and his son Guan Shun have never returned the deeds, so they filed a lawsuit. The defendant Xi Guanshun stated in court that the two houses had already been given to his mother by his maternal grandmother. Now that his mother is dead, he should naturally inherit them, and his maternal grandmother even made a will regarding this matter. Judge Luo then adjourned the case to a later date and ordered the defendant Xi Zengrong to be summoned to court for further questioning.</p>

<h3>「左傾」與「右傾」</h3>
<p>"Left-Leaning" and "Right-Leaning"</p>
<p>"Hey! I think the content of your amateur magazine is a bit left-leaning," a friend said to the reporter the other day. I was shocked when I heard this and quickly asked him what he saw that made him say that, and asked him to give a definition of what he called "left-leaning." He said, "This is an obvious fact! Look at the problems you describe," almost the entire magazine is about how workers suffer, how apprentices are mistreated, and other things like one long imperialism on the left, one short capitalism on the right. Anyone with common sense can see it at a glance, so why do you editors have to knowingly pretend to be ignorant? As for the definition of "left-leaning," that's even more unnecessary! Who doesn't know it? So-called left-leaning is a type of argument that is dissatisfied with the current social system and wants to transform it. Therefore, in the eyes of those who are responsible for maintaining the current social system and order, left-leaning thought has the suspicion and danger of being reactionary." After hearing this, the reporter couldn't help but laugh silently and said to this friend, "The responsibility of our editors is not to express our own opinions, but to be the voice of our friends in the industrial and commercial circles, to publish what they want to publish. Therefore, regarding "how workers suffer, how apprentices are mistreated," this is entirely the voice of society, the self-description of the contributors. What we need to pay attention to is whether these descriptions are facts, whether they are the ills of the current society. In addition, imperialism and capitalism are even more recognized as two major ideologies by historians around the world today, and it is not something that a mere editor can arbitrarily praise or criticize. If this is called left-leaning, then I don't know how right-leaning should be defined? If saying that dissatisfaction with the bad system of the current society, calling out loudly, and hoping to improve it is called left-leaning, then doesn't that mean that right-leaning is a pretense of peace and self-deception? In reality, we editors don't care about what is "left" or "right." We only know that human society is a progressive society, and all calls related to social progress are materials that we are happy to publish."</p>

<h3>寫給母親的信</h3>
<p>A Letter to Mother</p>
<p>— 孟巧寶女士作</p>
<p>— Written by Ms. Meng Qiaobao</p>
<p>紗廠女工</p>
<p>Textile Factory Worker</p>
<p>Mother: This is the first letter I've written to you since I came to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. Since I left home in February of this year, three weeks have passed without me realizing it! At home, planting fields, harvesting rice, raising pigs, and raising silkworms, we were busy non-stop. But those of us who are outside are really "forgetting our parents while enjoying a wide and boundless world," working like cattle and horses for the capitalists all day long! After working twelve hours in the factory, I still have to cook and wash clothes. I really don't have any energy left! The factory stipulates: one week of day shift, one week of night shift. In short, whether it's the day shift or the night shift, I can't sleep for more than six hours a day. Entering and leaving the factory is called "passing the checkpoint," because when we enter and exit, the Indian A-sans have to search us to prevent the workers from stealing things. Wages are paid every half month, and when we enter, we first have to deduct half a month of "stored wages,"</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Left in the factory as collateral. The best wage is eight or nine mao a day, and that's for doing [overtime management], doing [that mowei]. Like me, two or three mao is uncertain. If I'm not careful in my life, such as falling asleep during the night shift, or not smiling when I see the examiner, then I'll be fined and eat [chestnut shells]. This is just like what is said in a certain novel:</p>
<p>[A-cui! Is the food ready? It's almost five o'clock.] The sister-in-law in the pavilion room was calling to her daughter on the half-landing while holding vegetables in one hand and a pencil in the other.</p>
<p>A-cui's face was yellow. Her mother, in order to get the gentlemen in the factory to deduct less of her wages, had to save a few copper coins from eating [Gaoyou salted duck eggs] to buy her some [cold cream]!</p>
<p>Mother! This is the life of the average female worker on the Shanghai Bund!</p>
<p>After thinking carefully, there really is no fun in being human. If I had died from smallpox when I was fifteen years old during the first month, that would have been clean. But I just happened to get better, and I have to struggle in this hell! Sometimes, I often think like this at night: [How should a girl be when she grows up? The family that Sister Meijuan married into is not bad, but looking at her heart, she is always unhappy; Su'e often sheds tears when she meets me, probably because she has unspeakable pain! Chunju and Xiaoling, look at how they suffer themselves; like Aunt A-ming, Jinmei's situation | it goes without saying that young women are widows! Alas, I don't know what kind of situation I will be in in the future? ... ]</p>
<p>I'm happy that Mother is in good health! Is Father doing well at work? I miss you very much! I dreamed that I saw Father carrying a load of grain into the small hall, and my sister was following him with Xiaosheng to watch. But my dreams are often awakened by the sound of the erhu outside the alley. Every time I hear this sound, it makes me think of a little tune that we often sing in our factory:</p>
<p>[Since I entered the factory, my hands and feet are busy! XXX, abuses me, as fierce as a jackal. Work twelve hours, the wage is meager: it's hard to provide for my parents, it's hard to raise my children! ... ]</p>
<p>Before I came to Shanghai, I always thought that Shanghai was the Western Paradise. But after I arrived in Shanghai, I realized that it wasn't like that at all, especially for us workers in Shanghai. In fact, where we live is already in the countryside of Shanghai, so people here say they are [going to Shanghai] when they go to the main road.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law works in Zhabei and comes to see me about once a week. She always has that smiling look, as if she has a sum of money deposited in the bank. But in reality, her clothes are only worth five mao to pawn! She came to see me again yesterday, but I don't know why, she suddenly started crying. I asked her again and again what grievances she had in her heart, but she refused to say. Alas! She is as weak as I am.</p>
<p>Some people say that women's liberation must go through a major storm. I believe this a little now.</p>
<h3>兩種不同的女工</h3>
<p>Two Different Kinds of Female Workers</p>
<p>— 敏</p>
<p>— By Min</p>
<p>高跟皮鞋，皮大衣，　過的頭髮，塗了腥紅的嘴唇，扭扭揑揑走在馬路上的，那個不説她是摩登女郎？有誰知道她是一天做到晚，或一夜做到天亮的紗廠勞工呢？她自己也極力要瞞過旁人的耳目，將裝冷飯的飯籃，預先呌人代帶走了，將身上的棉花毛屑，刷揩得乾乾淨淨。她們當然是紗廠女工中的最少數，但一家有五六萬錠子的紗廠，至少有這樣的女工三四十個吧。她們是比較的有着高的地位，做着輕鬆的工作，每天可賺到五六角至八九角錢。可是她們往往逃不出廠裏職員的手掌，説説笑笑，當然毫没有男女的顧忌，即在機弄旁邊的摸摸索索，也算不了一回事，至於開棧房，或即在工房中幽會而被人捉奸一類的喜劇，也常常的扮演着。在職員固恃有權勢，容易勾引她們，但在女工方面，因爲家境不好，從小没有福氣受教育，自然也不免有不能潔身自愛的人。她們脱離了家庭的束縛，跑到大都會來做工，經不起種種的引誘暗示，如何能把持得住？所以她們，不論時髦的，不時髦的，美的醜的，不要説和職員，就是與同廠的男工，以及廠外一般游手好閒的人，均容易閙出笑話的。</p>
<p>Wearing high-heeled leather shoes, leather coats, permed hair, and smeared with crimson lipstick, walking down the road with a twist and turn, who wouldn't say she's a modern girl? Who knows that she is a textile factory worker who works from morning to night, or from night to dawn? She herself tries her best to hide it from others, having someone take away her lunch basket filled with cold rice in advance, and brushing off the cotton lint and fluff from her body. Of course, they are the minority among the textile factory workers, but in a textile factory with five or six thousand spindles, there are at least thirty or forty such female workers. They comparatively have a higher status, do lighter work, and can earn five or six jiao to eight or nine jiao a day. But they often can't escape the clutches of the factory staff. They chat and laugh, of course, without any consideration of men and women. Even groping and feeling next to the machine is considered no big deal. As for comedies such as opening a warehouse or having a secret meeting in the workshop and being caught in adultery, they are often performed. The staff members rely on their power and are easy to seduce them, but on the female worker side, because their families are not well-off and they have not had the blessing of education since childhood, it is inevitable that there will be people who cannot maintain their self-respect. They have broken away from the shackles of their families and come to work in the metropolis. How can they resist the various temptations and hints? Therefore, whether they are fashionable or unfashionable, beautiful or ugly, not to mention with the staff, they are prone to having jokes with the male workers in the same factory, as well as the idlers outside the factory.</p>
<p>另外有一種工人。她們好像終年不梳洗似的，頸上手上，積滿了污垢，衣服也　褸而骯　；走到人前，即有一種異味衝到人家的鼻管裏。而她們的腦筋，因爲受了生活的磨折，也像特别遲鈍的，往往對於極容易的事情，不會處置，或極簡單的數目，也不會計算。她們從家裏到廠裏，無處不受人欺侮：在路上會給人打翻飯籃：在廠門口，稍勿識相，會接受巡捕的火腿，在車間中更時時會受職員的　工錢，及遭女工頭的攔頭攔面亂打一陣。她們總是那副又像哭，又像笑的没有變化的呆臉。她們每天可賺三四角錢，甚至祇有一角多錢的，而且還要被她們的頭目吞没扣蝕了些。不過，她們很會將廠裏的棉咧，紗咧，零件咧，暗地裏偷到家裏去；［窮困］逼迫着她們這樣的做。</p>
<p>There is another type of worker. They seem to never wash themselves all year round. Their necks and hands are covered with dirt, and their clothes are shabby and dirty. When they walk in front of people, there is a strange smell that rushes into people's noses. And their brains, because they have suffered the hardships of life, seem particularly dull. They often cannot handle very easy things, or they cannot calculate very simple numbers. From their homes to the factory, they are bullied everywhere. On the road, people knock over their lunch baskets. At the factory gate, if they are not sensible, they will accept the patrol's ham. In the workshop, they are constantly deducted wages by the staff, and are beaten by the female foremen. They always have that unchanging, dazed look that is both crying and laughing. They can earn three or four jiao a day, or even only one jiao or so, and they still have to be swallowed up and deducted by their leaders. However, they are very good at secretly stealing cotton, yarn, and parts from the factory to their homes. [Poverty] forces them to do this.</p>
<p>上述這兩種工人雖不能説是紗廠女工的大多數，但可以代表同稱爲勞動階級的女工的兩方面。其餘還有一大部份女工她們無非是每天隨着人潮在工廠的喉　裏被吞入吐出，從天尚未明時做到晚上，或從太陽西落時做到太陽再從東方出來，至少有十二小時的工作，多的要做到十三至十五小時。她們受着種種的壓迫和侮辱，將海躍的生命在機聲隆隆中消磨掉，將鮮紅的血液漸漸　　夜旋轉不息的大輪吮吸盡，　常時要担心到夜飯米的多少，至於當着雪飛冰凍的時候要想添件寒衣，那更是不容易的啊！</p>
<p>Although the above two types of workers cannot be said to be the majority of textile factory workers, they can represent the two aspects of female workers who are collectively known as the working class. The rest of the female workers are just swallowed and spat out in the throat of the factory with the crowds every day, working from before dawn until night, or from sunset until the sun rises again from the east, at least twelve hours of work, and up to thirteen to fifteen hours. They suffer all kinds of oppression and insults, wasting their vibrant lives in the roar of machines, and gradually having their bright red blood sucked dry by the large wheels that spin endlessly day and night. They often have to worry about how much rice they will have for dinner, and as for wanting to add a piece of warm clothing when it's snowing and freezing, that's even more difficult!</p>
<h3>紫茄兒和熟山芋</h3>
<p>Purple Eggplants and Cooked Sweet Potatoes</p>
<p>— 玲女士</p>
<p>— Ms. Ling</p>
<p>一到冬天，白大裏我們樂器廠中幾乎滿眼都是紫茄兒和熟山芋，老是摇幌不定的掛在那兒，總要到了晚上纔被一一搬走。這些東西都没有人要吃，尤其是熟山芋，有一股異樣的氣味，連碰都没有人要碰的。那末，爲什麽我們廠裏會有這許多的紫茄兒和熟山芋呢？好，且聽我道來！</p>
<p>Every winter, almost all I see in our musical instrument factory is purple eggplants and cooked sweet potatoes, hanging there swaying uncertainly, and it always takes until night for them to be moved away one by one. No one wants to eat these things, especially cooked sweet potatoes, which have a strange smell that no one even wants to touch. So, why are there so many purple eggplants and cooked sweet potatoes in our factory? Well, let me tell you!</p>
<p>樂器廠女工</p>
<p>Musical Instrument Factory Worker</p>
<p>我們每天要做十小時以上的工作：當晨鐘敲了六下，訓服的機器嘰嚘嘰嗄的旋轉着時，那榨取我們血汗的工作便開始了。我的左手拿着冰塊般冷的口琴坯，右手拿着同樣冷的刀兒，锉兒，镊子和小銅片子，交换的使用着，兩脚也不住的打着風琴抽。大家都是這樣不停的動着，做着，全屋子裏充滿了喧囂的閙聲丨丨音節不調的都，來，迷，法，沙，拉，西。冷風像小偷兒似的從窗縫中偷偷地進來，吹得我們不住的打着冷戰。我們買不起毛襪和手套，即使有手套，戴着也有礙於工作，而廠裏又没有火爐或熱水汀等設備。於是，我們每一個人的腕上便添了一對紫茄兒，而這就是我們的手呀！我們的腿上也添了一對熟山芋，而這就是我們被凍爛了的脚呀！</p>
<p>Every day we have to work for more than ten hours. When the morning bell rings six times and the obedient machines spin around with a creaking sound, the work that榨取 our blood and sweat begins. My left hand holds the ice-cold harmonica blank, and my right hand uses the equally cold knife, file, tweezers, and small copper pieces interchangeably, and my feet are constantly pumping the organ. Everyone is moving and working like this non-stop. The whole room is full of noisy sounds 丨丨 off-key do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. The cold wind sneaks in from the window seams like a thief, making us shiver non-stop. We can't afford woolen socks and gloves. Even if we had gloves, wearing them would hinder our work, and the factory doesn't have stoves or hot water radiators or other equipment. So, each of us has added a pair of purple eggplants to our wrists, and those are our hands! We also have a pair of cooked sweet potatoes on our legs, and those are our feet that have been frozen rotten!</p>
<h3>誰是時代需要者</h3>
<p>Who Is the Person Needed by the Times?</p>
<p>— 紫薇</p>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>養蠶女</p>
<p>Silkworm Girl</p>
<h3>Fainting</h3>
<p>— Zhou Huaguo</p>
<p>Last summer, I went to visit a silkworm egg production farm. This was a large-scale breeding operation, with the entire farm divided into several departments. Taking the sericulture department as an example, their staff included: one technician, seven or eight technical staff, forty to fifty female trainees, and dozens of male workers. There were also temporary female workers hired to pick mulberry leaves. Because of the large scale, silkworms were raised and eggs produced three times a year in spring, summer, and autumn, with the summer silkworm season being the most difficult.</p>
<p>They dressed in white uniforms, like doctors. When entering the silkworm room, they had to change into another pair of slippers because all the utensils inside the silkworm room had to be disinfected. The silkworm room was very clean, and the air was very well ventilated (these are all necessary nurturing environments for silkworms). Before entering the silkworm room, one could not hear any sound. Although countless people were working, they were very calm and steady. Inside the silkworm room, one could only hear the endless sounds of silkworms eating leaves.</p>
<p>From the time of collecting mulberry leaves until the silkworms were placed on the cocooning frames, their work mainly consisted of feeding leaves and removing excrement. The number of times they fed leaves each day was very high. In addition to during the day, they had to feed the silkworms leaves once every night, so during the silkworm season, they could never sleep soundly through the night. The time for feeding leaves at night was usually around twelve o'clock. Each time they fed leaves, it always took more than two hours because each person had to take care of dozens of trays of silkworms. After feeding leaves at night, they had to feed leaves again at five o'clock in the morning, with little time in between, so they hardly slept at all. However, this situation was not just for one day; it was like this for all three silkworm seasons. Therefore, this kind of arduous sericulture work often scared people away. The breeding farm I visited originally had two male trainees. One of them had already left because he could not bear the hardship, and the one who remained had already informed the authorities that he would quit. From this, it can be seen that the hardship of their work is not only apparent when compared with that of men, but also from the cases of [suffocation] and [fainting] that often occurred in the silkworm room.</p>
<p>Among them, the hardest workers were of course the trainees. These female trainees were mostly daughters of poor families. As for the delicate young ladies of wealthy families, they could only use their tender hands to sit in some [palace] and play with their beloved toys. The hardship of this kind of work was beyond their wildest dreams. Every time they came out of the silkworm room, their clothes were completely soaked with sweat. Then they would return to their dormitory to change clothes, and only then could they enjoy a short rest, scattered in the shaded areas of the farm to cool off and rest. Some even had to write letters and do chores in the room. After dinner, when the scorching sun had set and it was relatively cooler, they all went to do laundry. They would wash the sweaty clothes they had changed out of during the day for themselves at this time.</p>
<p>These breeding farms are also run by capitalists. For their own private gain, they reduce labor benefits to the lowest level. These so-called trainees have virtually no benefits at all, only receiving a meager stipend of a dozen or so yuan. Therefore, under the name of so-called trainees, they became unpaid production workers for the capitalists.</p>
<p>Female Child Labor</p>
<h3>The Back Building</h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>The room I live in is a single-bay shikumen-style building. The second floor, attic, and rooftop are all fully occupied. There are a total of eleven tenants, almost more than in any ordinary hotel. Although I have lived here for more than half a year, I still don't know the names or professions of some of my fellow residents. However, every morning, when I hear the echo of the C yarn count nearby, they all leave, so I guess that most of them work in the yarn factories. There is also concrete proof: when I see them return at night, there is still some unfurled fuzz on their hair. With this characteristic, I feel that my speculation is correct. I also have some doubts about the little girl living in the back building. Judging by her stature, she is no more than ten years old, and her face is sallow, indicating that she is anemic due to malnutrition. Could it be that she is also working like the adults? I have never seen her when I go out at seven o'clock in the morning, but I hear her helping her mother cook in the evening, so I doubt whether she actually goes to work. It is hard for me to believe that someone so young could also be working. But I can only consider this a question and can't just go and ask about such an unnecessary thing.</p>
<p>One day, it was a Sunday morning, and both she and her mother did not go to the factory to work. I never have anything to do on Sundays, but I have never seen them idle at home. Even the fellow residents downstairs are still working as usual today. Why are she and her mother taking a break? I was wondering about this in my heart.</p>
<p>[Sister-in-law of the back building! You should be resting today.] I finally couldn't hold back the question in my heart and blurted it out, feeling as light as if a stone had been lifted.</p>
<p>[Hmph! How can we have any rest there? Like an ox plowing the field? There's no rest unless we fall ill! Xiaocui didn't fall ill, did she? Otherwise, huh! It's not even easy to ask for leave!] she said, her voice trembling and agitated.</p>
<p>[Oh! Xiaocui, is that the little girl? She was fine last night, wasn't she? How come I didn't hear anything about her getting sick! ...How pitiful! It's too cruel to make such a young girl work! ...]</p>
<p>[...There's no choice! If she doesn't work, we won't have enough to cover expenses. There are plenty of people like us in the factory! If you don't want to do it, there are many people who want to but can't. Isn't that right? When Xiaocui started doing this job, there were already many girls about her age who asked people to recommend them to the foreman. If Uncle A-Gen hadn't helped us, she would have been snatched away long ago.]</p>
<p>[Presumably, Cui's job is a good position? ...]</p>
<p>[Oh! What good position is it? Mr. Chen, it's clear that there are too many mouths to feed! Life in the weaving room is terribly hard. You have to stand next to the machine all day long, with your eyes fixed on the shuttle. If you have too many broken threads, they'll deduct your wages. You have to be careful.] [Is Xiaocui able to do it since she's so little? How much is her daily wage? Is it piecework?]</p>
<p>[She has to do it even if she can't. Luckily, many of her colleagues' sisters and friends don't dislike her; some of them are even willing to help her with some things. She didn't get any money back for the first two months, but now she can earn more than thirty cents a day. Mother and daughter can only barely take care of themselves.]</p>
<p>[Is there a rule that you don't get paid for the first two months? ...]</p>
<p>[Hehe! Mr. Chen, you really are an outsider! You know, it's not cheap to work in a yarn factory these days. Although there's nothing written in the regulations, you secretly have to spend money on the foreman, and you need connections to do so. Xiaocui is lucky that Uncle A-Gen is on good terms with the foreman, so she only spent one month's wages. According to the rules, she didn't get any money for the other month.]</p>
<p>I was a little embarrassed by her laughter and didn't dare to ask any more questions, fearing that I would be asking something completely irrelevant and make people laugh even harder.</p>

<h3>After Work</h3>
<p>— Jia Man</p>
<p>Groups and groups, packs and packs, the streets are filled with countless female workers. Looking at them, they are like giant waves, like vast tides, surging and undulating, coming over, and then passing by again, disappearing.</p>
<p>There are cries, shouts, running, noisy, chaotic sounds spreading from afar, gradually dispersing.</p>
<p>Their bodies are often covered with cotton fluff or broken threads, but some also wear fashionable cheongsams, rushing along with the others. Everyone carries bamboo lunch baskets or enamel lunch boxes.</p>
<p>The time is just around sunset, they have stopped their day of hard work and are leaving work. The factory is like a volcano, and like a waterfall, spewing countless gravel from the crater, releasing endless foam from the waterfall. Under the faint electric lights, it looks like a vast world of ants, churning and churning.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a tram or car rushes along the street, and whether it is gravel, foam, or ants, it immediately cuts out a vacant ditch, which is filled with gravel, foam, and ants again after the car disappears. At this time, the street is simply a world of workers, no, a world of female workers, they have taken over everything on the street! [How great, admirable and venerable female workers!] At the same time, the buildings and passersby that occupy a bit of space on the street are dwarfed, even smaller than a grain of sand on the ground!</p>
<p>[Sister Zhang, see you tomorrow.]</p>
<p>[Second Sister, come early tomorrow.]</p>
<p>[Sister-in-law A-Gui, see you tomorrow.]</p>
<p>When they reach the place where they have to part, some who are familiar with each other talk to each other and then rush to their respective homes. They also tell some jokes:</p>
<p>[Second Sister Liu, hurry up, your man must be waiting anxiously.]</p>
<p>[Third Sister, aren't you going to meet A-Jiang when you get home?]</p>
<p>Then, the other party is embarrassed to object: [Him? He's not anxiously waiting for me to go back. Your man is a little like that!]</p>
<p>[I'll smack your mouth, see if you say it again!]</p>
<p>Although they have exhausted all their energy on the factory machines, and everyone is exhausted at this time, there is still no lack of conversation among them, as if this conversation can reduce or forget some of their fatigue.</p>
<p>Gradually, the tram swallows up a piece, a corner, of the great tide. Time gradually moves forward, the waves calm down, the tide dissipates, and the gravel, foam, and ants all disappear into the night.</p>
<p>Female Waitresses</p>
<h3>The Girl Forgotten by [Love]</h3>
<p>— Yu Lun</p>
<p>Yin Jie, the daughter of Sister Wang next door, used to meet me every day. Recently, I only run into her at most once a week, and it's always between 2 and 4 PM on Saturday. It is said that she is now a most modern woman, making a living on her own.</p>
<p>She works as a female tea server at a certain university, serving modern, but not the most modern, young ladies all day long. But on Saturday afternoons from 2 to 4 PM, she has a two-hour break because most of the ladies are not at school during that time.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, she went home and came to visit me. [Do you find it hard work?] I asked her.</p>
<p>[Not at all!] she replied. [I only feel lucky. But sometimes I feel a little sad inside.]</p>
<p>[I don't understand what you mean.] I said.</p>
<p>[Then let me tell you. But you must not tell anyone else, especially my mother!] she said. I promised her, and then she continued.</p>
<p>[Working as a tea server at the university is better than working in a factory in terms of food, lodging, and income. My wages are only four yuan a month, but I don't rely on that. I rely on the generosity of the ladies. I serve ten rooms, with four ladies in each room. When the semester ends, each person gives an average of four yuan, for a total of one hundred and sixty yuan. Including my wages, that's equivalent to thirty yuan a month. This may not seem surprising to others, but I am very satisfied with it. And the work is not difficult either. I only sweep the floor once a day and pour hot water twice. In addition, I call for milk soup, bread, toast, etc. from the restaurants for the ladies. I don't have to bring these things back myself; the waiters will naturally deliver them.]</p>
<p>[However,] she continued, [I often deliver love letters for the ladies. I deliver red or yellow letters to the boys' dormitory, handing them to handsome young men in suits, and waiting for their replies. This is not hard work, but I think, we are both women, why can't I write love letters to people, and why doesn't anyone write to me? Why do I have to deliver messages for them every day? When I go to bed every night, when I think about this, I can't help but feel sad!]</p>
<p>My Self-Employment Introduction</p>
<p>Please see!!!</p>
<p>How many women are being oppressed</p>
<p>Ms. Mai Dian</p>
<p>Year after year,</p>
<p>Batch after batch,</p>
<p>I am from Nanjing, 21 years old, a graduate of a women's normal school. I used to be a primary school teacher, but resigned due to illness. Not long after, because I could not maintain my livelihood, I went to work in a certain musical instrument factory. It was stated that after three months of graduation, I could get a monthly salary of thirty yuan, and it could be increased monthly. I held great hope and lived this hard life of ten hours a day. But the reality always disappoints people. It has been more than four months now, and not only have I not been paid, but even the Sunday holiday has been taken away. This is intolerable! I was angry! Everyone was angry! So, the curtain of negotiations with the factory was opened. Our request was to urge the factory to fulfill the agreement, but the factory was clever. It gave itself three days to reply, recruited a new batch of weak women, and then fired us calmly in the name of creating trouble and causing disturbances. So, I am unemployed again! Alas! Is this my unfortunate fate, or is it the sin of society?</p>
<p>I can speak the Shanghai dialect and pure Mandarin, and I can repair musical instruments such as harmonicas and accordions. I am now willing to work as a primary school teacher, or a shop assistant, or an accountant, or a proofreader, or a nurse, etc. I hope for a salary of about thirty yuan. If you would like to hire me, please send a letter to this publication for forwarding.</p>
