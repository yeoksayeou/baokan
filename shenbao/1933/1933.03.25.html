<p>時評</p>
<h3>不誇勝不諱敗·</h3>
<p>熱河失陷沿邊告警地大物博之中華民國乃竟束手受制於短小之日本至於今日且有隨處被襲之危非我國人努力自勉决無以挽救此危局最近北平軍事當局對於戰爭之態度以「不誇勝不諱敗」昭告國人并以此爲宣布戰事實情之準則是誠扼要之言也</p>
<p>我我國九一八瀋變而後坐失三省國人於此即應痛定思痛力圖奮起以自拔於危亡乃不意過去一年餘時間竟隨意放過遂致授敵以再逞之機五十八萬方里之熱河亦竟嘭亡於一旦豈徒引痛泣血所能已乎是以今日之事除奮力一戰外别無救亡途徑戰勝不誇固屬非易戰敗不諱尤爲難能蓋戰敗而諱其心已餒即不敢繼續再戰我國自海禁開通後偶勝即自誇得意而小敗則諱莫如深自一千八百四十年鴉片之戰以迄於庚子戰爭、初則諱敗繼且議和其時雖危急萬狀然尙能在列强均勢中圖苟全也今則雖欲苟全而不可得惟有講求攻戰之道勝而不誇固非朝夕之間所可立至而敗而不諱則國人亟應勉爲能不諱敗乃能再戰吾人尤冀國人所以自勉者二端　　（一）復興國民經濟之實力近代戰爭論戰術則已立體化論人事則非集全國之力不爲功故戰爭之最後勝敗不决於大砲飛機而决於整個國民經濟實力我國人民疲敝已達極點此後惟一標的應在萬難之中解决一般人民之食住衣三大困難然後最終勝利乃可保持</p>
<p>（二）實行徵兵統一軍制以偶然募集之兵烏能責其人人愛國更烏能責以禦侮抗敵即以打破割據廢除私兵而論亦非實行徵兵制莫由</p>
<p>至於製造武器謹嚴訓練等雖屬要圖究爲技術問題設使能根本奠定則訓練與製造固非甚難之事戰敗不諱在我國大難當前之日必須人人敗而不餒乃能顯其不諱之能力重新故土徵諸歷史往蹟莫不皆然曾國藩之對太平天國也固常遭挫敗幾致覆没且太平天國已掩有東南而長江各省　人掌握收納北京僅差一間然而結果金陵卒被征服以頽廢不堪之滿清竟</p>
<p>能如此撑持者何耶蓋當時領兵諸將雖屢受挫敗屢遭困辱但仍屢起赴敵繼續爭戰是以終成其個人之功蹟滿清亦得多維幾十年之天下至於國際戰爭情勢當更嚴重而國民精神之力尤爲其重要核心試以世界第一次大戰證之當戰事爆發之初德軍之猛銳眞有拔山搗海氣吞法蘭西之勢乃法國奮力應戰再接再厲在此四年中之戰爭法軍幾至每戰必敗法國本土四分之一均淪爲戰塲然法人决不因戰敗而屈服反更加奮勉結果德軍敗退而法勝矣大革命後之蘇俄外受列國之封鎖内有白俄之侵襲國基未固人心未安境外猶有兵戈國内且有敵國然竟能勉力撑持奠定新國之基礎者亦以戰敗不餒繼續努力故也</p>
<p>我國當前之敵其兵力雖優於滿清時之太平天國但弱於戰前之德意志尤有遜於戰時之英美而論我國勢則較之法國戰事期中尙有地廣人衆之優點比之蘇俄革命當時猶具有較佳之規模假令戰事蔓延痛苦固多而爲爭民族將來之生存則奮起力戰絶不畏敗此其時矣</p>

<p>痛斥共産主義　對於近來共産主義之膨脹、大加痛斥謂「日前國會大厦之被焚、即可證明共産黨一旦得勢、國家治安將絶對失其保障、故全德人民今日實有團結一致、剷除共産毒之必要云</p>
<p>實行獨裁目的　希氏繼論及政府所要求之獨裁權、謂「政府並無取消各邦分治之意、但在一定之範圍内、全國及各邦之政治、應成立一種同一之系統、再則立法制度亦應加以改革、因人民如在四年之内、須投票二十次之多、則立法之價值已失」云、</p>
<p>復辟未便討論　至於復辟一端、德國之恢復牽制與否、現尙未屆討論之時、但中央政府對於任何一　邦之單獨行動、以求此問題之解决、則將認爲破壞統一、中央政府將施行適當之方法處置之、政府目前所應爲者、即在以報紙·文學·電影·無線電等等科學利器、促成德國之復興」云、</p>
<p>敎會國家要素　希氏復稱基督敎之二大敎會、實爲國家生命之要素、</p>
<p>保障私人財産　再則德國之經濟基礎、爲私人企業、及私人財産之應受最强固之保障、現政府應避免任何種類之幣制改革試驗、</p>
<p>積極救濟農工　此外則救濟農村及恢復失業工人、在經濟機械中之地位、亦爲政府之二大工作、但此非厲行强國之經濟原則不可、萬不能以其暫時强國之經濟原則不可、萬不能以其暫時不合乎羣衆之心理而遂中止之、</p>
<p>竭力奬勵製造　再以德國之地理而言、德國不能建立完全自足國家之可能、故必須覔得其出産品之出中簱此則儘可先從一種健全之物品交換入手、</p>
<p>鐵路收歸國有　希氏復稱德國之鐵路、將來必須仍舊收歸國有云</p>
<p>確立和平政策　希氏對於内政·外交及經濟之三大方針、主張政府應有絶對威權、以求信用及政局之固定、對外則以寬大及久遠之政策取得和平之途徑、而恢復國際間之信任、再則對於經濟方面、應使理智之原則、勝過一切、無論事業之組織或債欵之支配、皆一以理智爲歸宿、希特勒後復論及軍縮問題、</p>
<p>贊成四强合作　希氏稱「十四年以來、德國之軍備、已被列强所解除、而最近德國在軍縮會議中、以待各國之同樣減縮軍備者、亦已十四閱月、但結果則幾等於零、現英國已有新計畫提出、德國將竭其全力贊成之、而意大利目光遠大之方針、欲調解歐洲之列强、而促成和平、德國政府亦將加以擁護、蓋德人深望四國之和諧合作、能成事實、」希氏對於意大利之傾向、及贊助德國之期望、極表感謝之意、對於羅馬敎皇亦表示尊敬之意、</p>
<p>對法對俄邦交　而對於法國則稱「倘雙方均有眞誠諒解存在、則兩國尙可成立和好之基礎、至於俄國方面、則德國極願維持其友好關係、蓋德國内部之取締其産黨、實德國内部之事、絶對不受任何外來之干涉、亦不致因此而損及德國與他國間之邦交、」</p>
<p>國會無期休會　希氏末乃言及海外德僑之命運、謂若輩皆忠嚮政府、殊屬可嘉、至是乃請國會於與政府提携、抑與政府宣戰、二途之中擇一行之、繼由社會民主黨韋爾斯起立發言、圖證明該黨近數年來所持態度之正當、於是希特勒復以雄辯之論調、抨擊社會民主黨及該黨之事業、並謂「凡崇拜第三國際之人民、决不能容其有批評政府之權」云、繼乃略作辯論、由議長戈林宣布國會無期休會、如需重行召集、可由議長决之、</p>
<p>國會授權獨裁　哈瓦斯二十三日柏林電　以全權畀予政府之法律草案、頃經衆院以四四一票、對九四票通過、克羅爾劇場（即衆院開會地點）門前、人山人海、中有國社黨黨軍數千人、聞法案通過之訊、熱烈歡呼、希特勒總理立露臺上、向民衆作簡短演說、謂國社黨政府第一步政綱、現已達到、民衆當向政府效忠、俾得完成其第二步計畫、此項計畫、即以自由榮譽及威力、畀予德國人民是也云云、此次全權法律通過之後、無異以獨裁權力畀予政府、此案除社會黨而外、其他各黨皆投票贊成、</p>

<p>麥唐納在國會演說</p>
<h3>四强公約接洽結果</h3>
<p>民族主義復興和約須修改</p>
<p>英政府着手籌擬實行細則</p>
<p>路透二十三日倫敦電　英首相麥唐納今日在下院發表爲衆極所欲聞之言論、述其游日内瓦羅馬與巴黎之經過情形、英相謂當渠與西門外相抵日内瓦時、彼等覺軍縮會議已在崩裂之危險中、蓋各方對於細則、意見各異、工作莫能進行也、彼等不得已乃以平等許德國、今日已非列强以聨合力量强抑任何歐洲民族使之屈就其所認爲與自己尊榮抵觸的義務之時期、渠與西門外相深知今必須揭明者、加於歐洲任何國家之義務、乃榮譽且有責任的義務、而尤爲重要者、以此義務係自願担任者也、但近來所發生之事實、已大增目前依此而行之危險、是以英國計畫主張在過渡時代中平等本身未可實施、但求不再備戰而已、歐洲現甚不寗、而處於極惶恐狀態中、但軍縮會議因渠與西門外相之干涉、已復有生氣云、</p>
<h3>和平爲唯一目的</h3>
<p>英相繼言及羅馬之游、謂到羅馬後、意相墨索里尼示以簡短文件、擬發起歐洲四强之合作、以非戰公約精神維持和平、並對於德國在原則上承認其地位平等、意相計劃主張此四强相約不得用武力以解决任何當前政治困難、並主張立即依照國聨盟約第十九條修正條約、如此計畫可成公約、則此公約有效時期爲十年、今英政府將籌擬細則、庶意相計畫應以修正條約爲唯一旨趣、而非一般的和平旨趣云、議員有詢問「改修條約與一般的和平旨趣」之意義者、英相答稱、渠意此計畫不僅有一般的和平旨趣、但須以和平的組織爲其主要唯一旨趣耳、此計畫必不屏絶小國參加、因小國在若干方面上較諸大國尤有更大關係、以期銷滅因現有條約而起之衝突原因云、英相末稱、當不可避免的國家主義之禾興、使和約重付討論時、此種計畫可防免歐洲之危險云、當道旋對於首相所稱修改條約與一般的和平旨趣一語發表負責之說明、謂首相聲稱、英政府將籌議此計畫之細則、庶此計畫可不僅以和平爲一般的旨趣、且可不以修正條約爲一個大的而幾乎是唯一的細則云、</p>
<h3>修改和約之手續</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯二十三日倫敦電　首相麥唐納在下院陳述外交情形、會塲人滿爲患、各國外交代表亦多蒞塲、由麥相演說觀之、可見英意當局之目的、在於修改現行條約、惟目下立即實行之手續、則尙未確定、麥氏謂德國軍備問題、長爲混亂之原因、歐洲目下種種困難、亦均由此而起、歐洲如欲採取一種可以持久之政策、則必須以軍備平等權畀予德國、麥氏以簡括之文件、說明意相墨索尼里之計畫、而於其實行之細目則未嘗涉及、其主要精神、爲德國允許與英法意合作、而三國則保證就軍備平等原則對德讓步、以爲交換、麥氏根據國聨會盟約第十九條法理、主張現行條約有修改之必要、如四國能在國聨會範圍以内實行合作、則英國即就意相計畫、考慮實行之方法、其唯一重要者爲修改條約方法、但麥唐納對各保守黨保證修改條約、必不牽涉英國殖民地、對於各小國如有動作、亦必先徵求其意見、在各該國未表示意見以前、决不輕於更動云、（按國聨盟約第十九條規定大會可隨時請聨合會會員復核已經不適用之條約、並考慮足以危及世界和平之國際情勢、）</p>
<h3>保守黨右派顧慮</h3>
<p>路透二十四日倫敦電　英相麥唐納在下院所陳述之英政府外交政策、爲下院及報界抱各種政見者大多數所贊同、惟保守黨右翼則不以爲然、以爲英國干涉歐陸之結果、未必良好、彼等寧願英國採行不與聞之態度、條約如何可修正之問題、顯然尙未深切研究、所可無疑者、修正和約、必引起一九一九年受益諸國之反對、如波蘭與捷克固皆由此和約而産生也、一般輿情以爲四强除予德國平等地位外、不能獨有作爲、蓋欲處理波蘭走廊即割普魯士爲二者之複雜問題、非得波蘭之合作不可、波蘭必欲得出海之路、而後始可放棄走廊、然波蘭欲得出海之路、則將成牽涉波羅的海諸小國之糾紛事件、是以處理走廊之問題、殊不易着手也、惟自三月五日希特勒復握德總理大權以來、日處於恐慌中之歐洲若干國、今聞希特勒之言、當可暫時安慰、蓋希特勒在德國熱血沸騰言詞激昻之時、聲明德國準備參加和平計論、而願與世界他國、共同生活於和平中也、</p>
<h3>法國態度仍不利</h3>
<p>路透二十四日巴黎電　法國報紙、對於英首相麥唐納今日在下院之言論、未作好評　如巴黎迴聲報評論稱「引誘報服祇足以促追希特勒與墨索里尼獨裁之暴行」、法人憂慮、現在分驟將進至修改條約一途、法人認爲修約一事時期尙未成熟、至於邱吉爾主張外交事務須由外交途徑進行、反對麥唐納之大陸交涉、巳引起法國之極大滿意</p>
<h3>希特勒將赴羅馬</h3>
<p>國民社二十四日倫敦電　頃悉德意親善更將有新進展、德總理希特勒已定於四月初飛航至羅馬、與意相墨索里尼會晤、又德國鋼盔團領袖亦已接受意相邀請、將於聖靈降臨節赴羅馬、</p>
<h3>小協約另有主張</h3>
<p>國民二十四日日内瓦電　改組之小協約、乃以羅馬尼亞·捷克斯拉夫·南斯拉夫三國組合而成、共有陸軍四十五萬人、觀此間視此最足妨害意相墨索里尼所提議四强和平協定之成功、此間觀察家多位、當軍縮會議羅馬尼亞代表鐵杜萊斯主張立即討論英國之軍縮計劃時、其心意中實表現小協約之反對、似足使德意匈三國獲密切諒解之任何條約修正、並信如墨索里尼之計劃、能與軍縮建議同時討論、則羅馬尼亞代表將乘機攻擊墨索里尼之計劃、今兩種計劃皆表示德國恢復其與列强平等之地位、法國向以贊助改組之小協約聞、而小協約則以意德匈三國益將親善是懼、故今日一般人干之目光、咸注意於英相麥唐納之一言一行、麥唐納亦深知此情、故今日在院中有如能調和大國與小國之意見、則可大有助於和平之言、此間重要人士之意、皆以爲今日能安定小協約之恐慌者、唯麥唐納一人耳、夫中歐之創設國際團體、其本旨原爲防禦意匃外交政策積極之趨勢、彼等向以修正和約爲懼、故組織鞏固之團體、俾隨時可應付任何共同所遭之脅迫、意人稱此爲歐洲神聖聨盟、法人則視此爲歐洲現局之和平基礎、小協約之成立、捷克外長皮尼士厥功最偉、小協約前曾虞羅馬尼亞爲政治引誘而聨意、或爲經濟協助而聨德、繼防意德匃三國結成聨盟、故爲自保計、乃團結以對外、彼等深知匃牙利必將重置武裝、近者喜登堡之軍械案、定足增重彼等之恐慌、彼等責意國密運來福槍八萬四千枝、機關槍二百架、取道奥國接濟匈牙利、此種破壞和約之行動、如不能早日獲滿意解釋、則小協約擬請願於國聨云、據觀察家之意、小協約之潛勢力殊不可侮、蓋三國在日内瓦不特互允取共同對外政策、且相約非經其他兩國同意、决不與外國締結條約、且捷克外長皮尼士在國聨會議發言、輒受衆尊崇、今後必將爲三國有所主張也、</p>
<h3>殖民地重行分配</h3>
<p>國民社二十三日巴黎電　英政府雖極端否認、但巴黎迴聲報今日復載一消息、稱英首相麥唐納在羅馬時、曾與意首相墨索里尼論及各列强殖民地重新支配一事、並稱墨索里尼曾建議前德國在斐洲所有殖民地、應仍歸德國所有、但麥氏對於此種建議、則未能同意云、</p>
<h3>東北屠塲中之三千萬民衆</h3>
<p>僞官甘被利用之原因</p>
<p>日人毒謀已實行者九</p>
<p>瀋陽通訊、東北淪亡、巳逾十八月、東北　象、究　如何、　國人無從探知、即有知之者、亦無非由報章或來人所傳之片段消息而已、予今歲兩次赴東北實地考察、茲將所得之結果、擇要臚列於左、以便　心國事者之參考焉、</p>
<h3>爲政府内之二派</h3>
<p>日人所僞造之滿洲國、由表面上觀之、似爲一致的、豈知其内幕、亦分二途、（甲）復辟派、溥儀固爲日人所利用、以滿洲人長滿洲國、安知溥儀亦擬假日人之力、以資作帝國大夢、以鄭孝胥等輔之、故鄭等終見棄於日本、（乙）協和會派、趙欣伯等本愛日之熱誠、盡忠滿洲國、即與暴日組成協和會、宣傳滿洲國立國之本質、施行王道之德政等等、故日本對於此派人物、大加奬勵、</p>
<h3>僞文武官僚態度</h3>
<p>僞滿洲國内、文官如省長廳長縣長、武官如司令旅長等、何以彼等竟甘心作僞國傀儡、其原因有二、（甲）九一八事變前不得志之人物、大爲活動、利用時機、以遂其志、日人利用此輩、以資號召、（乙）因其財産、皆在東北、倘不接受日人之委、彼即没收其財産、因此諸多官僚、寗背其良心、亦所不辭、總之彼等之所以親日者、蓋有所貪戀也、至於其他文武下級官員對於日本無直接接洽之機會、因之對於日本、亦不起親善之情感、只是每日上班應卯、每月到期領薪、一言以蔽之、爲謀生而已、别無他種作用也、予當問曰、謀生可向國内、何必爲僞國之官、彼等答曰、因有赴北平等處、謀事候差、半載亦未成功、吾等聞知、即不敢赴國内謀事矣、由此可知一般下級官員之居心、絶非親日也、</p>
<h3>民衆不信仰僞國</h3>
<p>東北民衆、對於僞國、並不信仰、故日人往往僞造民意、與事實大相懸殊、以東北受難民衆論之、日人雖用其僞親善手段、每當春耕借給農民春耕費、或免雜捐、或筵宴鄉老等種種私誘之法、但一般老百姓竟早窺破其釣餌、曾以耳聞目覩朝鮮人之先例、爲前車之鑑、而不再受其欺矣、</p>
<h3>日軍慘暴之種種</h3>
<p>東北民衆受日軍之種種慘暴、分爲四項述之如左、（一）假檢查爲名、日軍往往盤查行人、見其行跡稍有不如意之點、日軍即以反日之罪狀加之、於是不問確否、當即令其自掘墳墓、掘畢活埋坑内、此其慘暴者一、（二）假清潔爲名、日軍任意赴各商號旅館各住宅内、大事搜查反日宣傳品、或三民主義等書籍、倘未查出書籍而查見有三民主義四宇者、日軍即興文字之獄、此其慘暴者二、（三）日軍假防疫爲名、當春夏之間、對於城市之民衆及旅店、强迫注射毒藥針、經注射後、針痕處立即高腫痛癢、須待月許始消、其用心之毒辣可知、此其慘暴者三、（四）日軍假剿匪爲名、探知某鄉有匪、彼即下鄉痛剿、擊走後、即認住匪之村民全爲土匪、必將全村民衆、一律擊斃、使其無一能幸免者、其居心之殘忍可知、此其慘暴者四、日宼旣有以上種種慘暴行爲、因逼而全家自盡者有之、遷移國内者、車載船運、絡繹不絶、其無遷移費、多有賣子女、以資路費、比比皆是、老幼無力逃走、而凍死於途者、往往有之、古人所謂十室九空、現在東北竟成十室十空、日軍慘暴獸行、蓋可知矣、</p>
<h3>過去未來的宰割</h3>
<p>自九一八事變後、日人施行種種政策、與毒辣之手段、實令人不勝駭汗、其槪要（一）僞滿洲政府之成立、作用分甲乙丙三項（甲）遮掩國際耳目（乙）敷衍人民心理、機關仍爲東北人所執掌、日人僅置一二顧問、使一般人覺得非日滅我、於建設僞國、自不得反對、以便增加行政效率、日人不諳我國語言和地方情形、政策雖高妙、亦不易表現、因起用從前善於壓榨人民的地方官、及東北政界之巨頭、以增進殖民地行政之效率、（二）財政統一委員會、作用分爲三項、第一項變東北一切銀行爲日本銀行、合組東北一切銀行、爲一滿洲中央銀行、以日鈔三千萬爲基金、第二項没收官僚存欵、非僞國服務之官僚存欵、統以逆欵名義没收、第三項統一錢法、東北現僅有僞滿洲中央銀行票及金票、日人極便於操縱、現銀鈔爲金票價格、一致對於推銷日貨及其直轄鐵路之收入、有莫大方便、（三）土地局、作用亦分爲三項、第一項没收官僚豪地、第二項整頓省地畝稅分營業區及民區、按月應納極重之稅（現未實行）第三項調查農村之地畝數、及地質、準備將來投資、（四）經濟封鎖、作用分爲四項、第一項壓低糧行、第二項農村貸欵、由縣爲出手續、第三項土貨專賣、如東北人自製之棉紗布疋火柴等、以低價售於日人、而日人則重價出售、此即壟斷政策、第四項日貨免稅、五情報處、省會警務廳内、設有總處、各縣均設立分處、專司偵察義勇軍及反僞國宣傳者之報告、隨時可由地方機關逮捕、調查員以村長及地方惡棍充之、（六）東亞同盟會、起用東北失意之軍官、令其組織大規模之軍隊、移其眷屬於長春、在日人監視之下、免其組織義軍、同時並用之銷滅義軍、招集東北失業之靑年、籠絡以優厚之薪餉、免其充義軍、並用之銷滅義軍、雖東北靑年、其抱負未必若是、然一墮圈套、日人自有牽制之妙法、（七）奴性敎育（甲）廢除文宇、今年僞國之敎部、限令敎員學生、皆得通用日本字母、爲廢消中文之入手、（乙）改變心理、其課程專以養成學生屈服忍耐卑汚糊塗、麻木頽廢爲宗旨墌（八）兩重高壓政策、（甲）日人對於義勇軍區域、及後占領地方示威、逐村搜查、盡量放射機槍、使人民知反抗必死、而不敢反抗、（乙）軟化的放賬赦免地畝、派王道宣傳員、赴各地講演、以天堂樂園等欺騙愚氓、覺亡國亦甚好、使根本不思反抗、（九）分地治縮小省界、擬劃由東北爲二十餘縣、作用分甲乙兩項、（甲）加重統治力量、（乙）斷絶人民聨絡、除受奴性敎育者、僞政府服務者、經商者外、餘均不能由此省至彼省、現東北即實現洮北洮南興北等箥、（十）工商會會計、積聚資本、計劃進行、以便壟斷東北之工商業、（十）（一）國民登記、國民之賣身紙奴隸劵、（十）（二）警察法、鄉村派警察、工人執行其神聖公安法、屆時人民言論行動集會之自由全無、人名警察武斷政治、（十）（三）消滅智識階級、爲防智識分子之反動及鼓吹計、俟國民登記警察設立後、便將以學匪名義逮捕或驅逐智識分子、（十）（四）婚姻法、（甲）滅種、重收婚姻稅、貧乾便無力結婚、（乙）弱種、有結婚力量者、强制其早行結婚、使其所育子女不强健、（十）（五）提高捐稅、（十）（六）農村投資、（十）（七）機器業打倒手工業、以上一至九爲已行者、九至十七爲擬實行者、不數年間、行見以吾人之血、供彼開摩托車、以吾人之頭顱、爲彼築峨峙式之洋樓、以吾人之子女、爲彼充服役之牛馬、斯而可忍、孰不可忍、深願黨國負責者、火速出三千萬民衆於屠塲中也、</p>

<h3>由連赴閩</h3>
<p>毓大輪船公司總行在營口、滬上設有分公司、經營裝貨事宜、該公司共有商輪三艘、爲毓大·毓濟·毓通·等、而毓通輪之載重最少、計船身關噸九百二十噸、船主爲日人三神龍雄、共有船員三十餘人、該輪去冬、因營口冰河、乃改行大連興化間、此次由大連載雜糧荳餅等貨、船内並無搭客、運往福建興化交卸、</p>

<h3>檢查租界工廠</h3>
<p>市府决定交涉原則</p>
<p>中央社云、關於實施工廠檢查、因租界方面之反對、迭經市政府交涉、迄無結果、茲悉市府當局、刻正計議一妥善交涉原則、俾租界内各工廠早日施行檢查、茲誌其詳情如次、</p>
<p>原則大意　工廠檢查、關係工廠安全極大、實業部有鑒於斯、迭次咨請市府早日實施、並派該部勞工司司長李平衡來滬、會同市府及有關係各機關、督促辦理、市區方面、早已完成、公共租界及法租界方面、則因各該租界當局之反對、延遲未舉、最近市府方面、曾迭派代表與租界當局、作非正式之集商、亦無進展、市府秘書長兪鴻鈞氏等、因此現正計議一妥善交涉原則、俾呈請中央决定後、再行依照進行、該項原則大意可分爲二項、（一）交涉無結果、竟取强硬步驟、（二）與租界方面、妥商一妥善解决辦法、但以目下各種情形推測、將來當採取第二項較爲適當、</p>
<p>租界態度　公共租界工部局對於我方實施租界内工廠檢查、初無堅决之反對、旋因租界内各西人開設之各工廠、深恐我方施行工廠檢查後、爲謀工廠之安全起見、勢必加以糾正、而予廠方以不利、故極力反對、於無形中、工部局方面遂增加其反對程度、茲爲避免我方進行檢查起見、將於四月十九日納稅西人會大會時、提出修改洋涇浜章程附件第三十四條、俾工部局有自行檢查工廠之權、而阻止我方檢查、此事關於我國主權極大、故必引起交涉、且洋涇浜章程第二十八條規定洋涇浜修改後、須得公使團之正式通過、并我國政府之同意後、方生效力、關於此點、我人須加以深切之認識云、</p>
<p>籌設協會　自正泰橡膠廠及永和實業公司橡膠部相繼發生爆裂汽缸慘案、死傷工人多命後、本市中國工廠檢查協會同人、鑒於工人安全、實有保護之必要、故籌設産業福利協會、以輔助工廠檢查之進行、該會一切籌備事宜、已由市社會局工廠檢查股田和卿等分頭進行矣</p>
<p>外國銀行</p>
<h3>猛力吸收現銀</h3>
<p>據昨日日文上海日報載稱、自財政部實施廢兩改元兩銀並用以來、外國銀行方面之吸收現銀傾向、愈形顯著、曩對美國之現銀輸出數量、至十九日達千五百條、目下麥加利銀行花旗銀行等美國銀行家之吸收現銀、依然不絶、以致華商銀行方面之在庫現銀、漸移於外國銀行、上海之在庫銀、亦呈漸减之勢、查至二十三日爲止、現今之在庫銀、計規銀爲一五三·一八九·○○○兩、洋銀爲二五八·九九○·○○○元、即洋銀增加至二·六○○·○○○元、規銀减少爲二六一·○○○兩云</p>

<p>工部局</p>
<h3>本年財政狀况</h3>
<p>虧短一百四十二萬兩</p>
<p>恢復二釐總捐難久延</p>
<p>工部局財務委員會、於三月十七日、集會時、財務處長陳述上年之收入結果、與本年之預計、就各部分應需之支出統計之、本年之經常費、約爲一六·四七五·○○○两、另外敎育經常費爲一·六二三·○○○兩、總共合一八、一○○、○○○兩、</p>
<p>經常收入、除彌補上年虧短之五萬餘兩外、計爲一六、六七○、○○○兩、與支出相較、約不敷一四二○、○○○兩、此數約等於二釐之市政捐三季之徵收額、</p>
<p>爲求預算之平頹　、又鑒於現今商業之凋敝、與本埠上年經過戰事、至今尙未完全復原、故仍設法避免將市政捐恢復至一分六釐之數、惟此係鑒於現狀、不得己之舉、增捐一層、將來終難久延、蓋緣近五年來、工部局有出售電氣處之售價、得以從容應付、故本年之計劃、擬卽以此項特别收入爲根據、由公積金内調撥一、一○○、○○○兩、歸入經常收入、如此、一九三三年度市政捐、可免加增、仍照一分四釐徵收、</p>
<p>但市政開支、年有加增、雖名處主管人員、力事緊縮、然入欵如不加多、則一切有關公衆利益之計劃、皆難進行、卽衛生處、其工作已日見增重、而按照現有之敎育方針、則敎育費亦逐漸增高、故財務處長之意見、以爲凡有　欵甚巨、又非一次可了之大建設、皆需極端審愼施行、</p>
<p>本年之臨時費部分、支出約爲二九、九二○、○○○兩、内包括上年虧短之一、三一六、六○○兩、但敎育臨時費五二六、一五○兩、則不在内、收入項下、除敎育費外、共計有二九、九六○、○○○兩、内有六百五十萬兩之譜、需募公債充之、如此收支相較、計臨時項下、尙約餘四萬兩之譜、</p>

<p>我現在有一個疑難問題，就是中華民國中的靑年，壯年，什麽農，工，商，學，兵，都是專講戀愛問題，在這新時代新潮流中，固應當公開的討論，以明人生的甘苦：我亦不能謂舊代人物，也不可稱完全新潮流，終擇舊新中的良善者，作一人生的目標。然而這多事的國家，外患日深中的中華，熱河失去未一月中的國土，大聲疾呼的愛國志士，正在努力狂喊，醒醒的熱浪聲音，被激醒的也不在少數，然醉生夢死在戀愛，色情，中更不可以數計。卽時貴顧問中，没有一天不披露婚姻戀愛的問題，諸位先生雖以很誠懇的答復，而對失戀，未戀·情魔，的靑年壯士，以爲披露就是導師，依答復所言，循循的做去，可得結果。，一般奮志的靑年，確不願以所奮的精神，來作研究，固然，近代的惹人注目，只有二條路，一，就是戀愛，一，就是救國·這二條路，在現處潮流中，可得很好口碑·一般討論戀愛的，無時不在研究增進，一般注意國難的，無時不在閱報思想，高談闊論，宣傳募捐種種的工作·戀愛足可危邦弱族，（得成效的），諸先生：要使研究戀愛的人們，成爲注意國事的份子，須從那一部進行，促其變化，請作一最詳細而警惕的導言，公佈，成我希望結果；謝謝你們！在最近内披露，</p>
<p>答：足下所提出的問題，非常重要，值得提出請讀者大衆討論。茲先就記者管見所及，略貢一得藉備大衆參考我們每天必收到很多的信件討論戀愛問題，老實說，本欄篇幅有限，若果一一發表的話，那就没有討論其牠問題的餘地了。而且中國到了如此地步，一班靑年猶鎭日價沉溺在温柔鄉裏，甜哥哥來，蜜姊姊去，「陳叔寳眞無心肝！」此語實不能否認！然而這實在是我們一時的感情之論，若就社會的階級關係分析起來，那這些中小資産階級的靑年，他們飯吃飽了，舒舒服服地生活着，曉得什麽國家興亡，自然不談戀愛，便無以自聊；不錯，也有少數還有革命性的靑年，他們在無路可走之時，也往往走到戀愛一途，意識地自趨於沉淪，這一部分人，我們自然對之還未絶望，然而大多數現在談戀愛的朋友，我們要冒犯一句：實在没有希望！這班靑年朋友，俗話說得好：「武大郎打飛脚，出手就不高！」所以他們向我們顲戀愛，我們十九是置之不答，或則我們答他一句：「汝安則爲之！夫我則不暇！」不過我們要分清：有工夫談戀愛的只是有閑階級的少數靑年，大多數的貧民大衆的靑年是不會談戀愛，也没工夫談戀愛的，將來和現在的國事是要放在他們的雙肩上的，我們的目光是要注在這些靑年身上才對。我們願爲他們盡一得之愚，做識途的老馬，或是和他們商量救國問題，我說這話，一定有許多人不贊成，以爲我忽視這些靑年的前途，難道我們不能轉變他們，使他們走向另一光明正大的途徑，這些中小資産階級的靑年，若果没有一個革命的環境，尤其是在殖民地似的中國，要薰陶他們，做積極的爭鬭，是很不容易的。足下所謂：「要使研究戀愛的人們，成爲注意國事的份子」，慚愧得很！這個責任我們是不敢當！足下不要誤會，我們反對談戀愛，是從道德觀念出發。恰恰相反·我們不是禁欲主義者，我們並不把性生活看得比吃飯穿衣還輕，然而這却有點區别：不吃飯，幾天便會餓死，不穿衣幾天便會凍死，不談戀愛，却是不會死的。而且這種問題，在勞苦大衆簡直簡單得多，易禮膺說得好：「靑年運動在牠對性慾問題的，並誇張地論到性慾問題的態度上，是受摩登病的侵害。「摩登」一字給了一種諷刺的語勢，而且和往常一樣做着怪樣子。……像這樣錯誤的槪念，在靑年運動中。是有害的，是危險的。這些槪念能夠很容易帮助他們一些人在性生活中的過於興奪和過火的行爲·年靑人的健康和力量浪費上去。你必須反對這種現象。在婦女運動和靑年運動之間没有一點聨系。女同志們必須系統地和靑年們共同工作，這是從個人到社會方面的，母性的一種種續，一種擴大和發揚。而且婦女的一切覺悟的社會生活與行動必須受到鼓勵，使他們能夠打破她們的庸俗的個人主義者的家庭和家族心理底界限。……」我們從這一段話裏，抽繹出一句最重要的話來做本文的結論，就是：「女同志們必須系統地和靑年們共同工作」這就是說，只有靑年男女們在革命鬭爭中共同工作，用現在的話說，即在抗日戰爭中共同工作，才是發展男女兩性靑年之社會生活與行動的根本救濟的方法！足下以爲何如？</p>

<h3>收音機的選擇（一）</h3>
<p>— 雄</p>
<p>假如你要有一隻收音機，採用那一種方式好呢？從最簡單的鑛石機起，到最複雜的無極外差式（Ｓuperhetrodyne）爲止，種類不知其多少。而同一種方式中，又有用直流電的，用交流電的，同一用交流而又同一方式的收音機，又有各種各樣的牌號，購置那一種機器，那一家出品好呢？這問題實在很難回答。</p>
<p>一般優良的收音機，應具備下列的條件：</p>
<p>（一）感度銳敏，</p>
<p>（二）選擇性優良，</p>
<p>（三）聲音明晰而響亮，</p>
<p>（四）没有雜音，</p>
<p>（五）動作安定，</p>
<p>（六）使用簡易，</p>
<p>（七）價格低廉，維持費不大。</p>
<p>感度的銳敏大體比便於眞空管數的多少，然而同一眞空管數，同一接線方式，感度亦常有差異。這個原因，是在所用機件的優劣，以及配置的是否適宜，接線的是否完全，非把每一隻的收音機實地試騐過，决難一言斷定。</p>
<p>欲收遠方微弱的電波非有高週率擴大不可。高週率擴大之設計完美者，感度自敏。然而檢波作用之是否良好，又是與收音機之感度有重大的關係的。</p>
<p>所謂選擇性，就是能將不願接收之電波容易隔離，凡高週率回路，即振盪回路的同調作用銳敏者選擇性亦優良。又若以不同的方式而論，則鑛石機的選擇性最爲不良，眞空管式中之有高週率擴大，及利用適當的再生作用者較良，至若無極外差式應用特殊原理而設計者，其選擇性之優，自然無出其右。</p>
<p>聲音的明瞭，以鑛石式爲最。這是誰也都承認的聲音的響亮，端賴低週率的擴大。然而低週率擴大，若設計不善，則聲音易於失眞。雜音的有無，取决於機件的優劣，和接綫的良否。然又視地方情形而不同。價格之高低與平常維持費之多寡，以及取用之便利與否，又均須視收音機内部構造，與所用電源而定。譬如用交流機，則維持費自可較省。然而聲音之明晣不及直流。用鑛石機則一切均甚便捷。可是顧此失彼，欲同時使收音程遠，感度敏，選擇善，却又不能了。</p>
<p>總之，在今日的情形之下，實在還不能有一種十全十美的收音機，足供任何人的採用。我們惟用審察自己需要的情形，以爲取捨之標準。</p>
<h3>一個小經騐</h3>
<p>— 莊智鴻</p>
<p>丨用米厘安培表代伏脫表丨</p>
<p>在實騐後的所得，而和學理相吻合的一個小經騐，就是利用米厘安培表（Ｍilliammeter）來代替伏脫表（Ｖolt　Moter）·去測量那綫路中的電厭，雖然，並不是一件很驚人的經騐，可是對於修理電機和喜歡研究的人們，却是不可不加注意的，因爲當你要細細地查出那機件的損壞，確在那裏，你就非用伏脫表和米厘歐培表來測量不可：兩者缺少其一，這工作也許就會使你中止了。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：在我們學理上所規定的幾個公式。</p>
<p>（一）電壓伏脫＝電流安培×電阻　姆</p>
<p>（二）電流安培＝電壓伏脫電阻　姆</p>
<p>（三）電阻　姆＝電壓伏脫電流安培</p>
<p>丙１００，０００ＯＨＭＳ１００Ｖ１５０　２００　３００　５００</p>
<p>乙１００，０００ＯＨＭＳ１０　Ｖ１５　２０　３０　５０　８０　１００</p>
<p>甲１，０００ＯＨＭＳ１.　Ｖ1.5　２　３　５　８　１０</p>
<p>假如我們米厘安培表上所指定的一個米厘安培，而現在要當牠一個伏脫用，換句話說，就是要一個米厘安培等於一個伏脫，那魔照我們第一公式裏所說的，要伏脫等於米厘安培，非接上電阻不可，所以應當先求出電阻的歐姆。</p>
<p>電阻電歐姆電＝壓伏脫流安培＝一伏脫一米厘安培＝一　００１＝一０００歐姆</p>
<p>現在把這一千歐姆的電阻器連接在米厘安培表上，就可以拿來測量電壓了。</p>
<h3>埃拉哥丨發見鐵能磁化者</h3>
<p>— ＫＰ</p>
<p>埃拉哥（Ｆruncais　Arago）是法國的物理學家及天文學家，一七八六年生於披萊耐（Ｐyrenees），一八五三年死於巴黎。他的一生，波瀾曲折，極饒戲劇的意味。他原是商人，後來以志願當兵，經試騐合格，正式入營，但在作戰的時際，爲敵人俘虜，歷九死一生，僅得生還。遂改投巴黎測量所服務，縝密地探究極光與某種磁氣及電氣與地球磁氣的關係。他又研究電流通過導線之際是否在任何塲所都有相等的磁性，發現了散布在導線四周的鐵屑，在電流通過的時際能被吸引。他又發見内部有鋼鐵針的線圈，如通以電流，則鐵針不但是一時的磁化，且成爲永久的磁化。不過鐵針磁化永久性的發見，不止埃氏一人，英國的台維氏也有同樣的發見，目其發見時間，適與埃氏幾乎同時，這實在是件有趣的巧合。</p>
<h3>修理無線電應注意的幾點</h3>
<p>— 組歸</p>
<p>無線電收音機之構造，亦可謂之極複雜，亦可謂之極簡單，人或將以此語爲奇突，然試觀收音機之内容其縱横交互，五色繽紛之接線，及方圓大小雜然並列之另件。狀固極爲複雜，但若一一分解之，則除眞空管外，所用者不外電容器，線球及電阻而已，所異者線路耳，是以着手修理者，須先明其線路及其功用然後施工自可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>線路旣明，自易着手，然諺云，工欲善其事，必先利其器，在未着手之先，必須置備應用之工具，否則恐修理未善，而反損壞若干部份也，</p>
<p>次爲測騐用之儀器，收音機，旣因故障而不能發聲，則一切自非人耳所能測聽，惟有儀器是賴，所謂儀器，即各種不同之電表是也。</p>
<p>檢騐收音機之要點，可分爲二，甲爲機械方面（俗稱硬傷）乙爲電氣方面。如物質損傷折裂等屬之甲類，若用品失其效用，則歸諸乙類，然後分門别分類一修繕之，更新之，工作固未嘗困難也，惟目下之試爲修理者，往往不分皂白，妄行拆動，終至束手，無策告謝不敏者，數見不淺，爰述數语以作發凡。</p>
<h3>收音機障碍之檢查與處理（一）</h3>
<p>— ＡＡ</p>
<p>我本來預備寫一篇「怎樣管理收音機」的但後來覺得這題目太大了·且留着將來再寫現在先來談一些必需的知識：即收音機障碍檢查法。</p>
<p>收音機的出毛病常見的是：一·毫無聲息：二·音響低微；三·忽斷忽續，四·發生雜音：五·音響不眞：六·分隔不絶。本文，就依了這六種毛病來說明其現象，原因·及其處理法。</p>
<p>一、毫無聲息者</p>
<p>一箋好好的收音機，忽然毫無聲息·一切的聲音全然聽不見．這當然是收音機的内部損壞了，但損壞在那一部分呢？是不是致命傷？必須自己設法知道，然而可以决定自己處理或者送往廠家修理，或者另購新機。怎樣檢查法呢？請讀下表：</p>
<p>現象　　原因　　處理法</p>
<p>眞空管不燃</p>
<p>眞空管斷線　掉換新的</p>
<p>眞空管座與眞空管脚接觸不全　使之接觸完全</p>
<p>開關接觸不良（交）　使之接觸良好</p>
<p>保險鉛絲斷線（交）掉換新的</p>
<p>電池接入線斷線（直）掉換新的</p>

<p>上表所列各部分原因如爲交流機所專有者，附註「交」字，爲直流機所專有者，附註「直」字，爲便於檢查計也。</p>
<p>諸君的收音機如果發生了上述的現象，不妨依上表檢查檢查看，說不定你就會自己醫治牠哩。</p>
<p>下一次談聲音低微的檢查與處理。</p>

<h3>天線之種種（續）</h3>
<p>— 金雲樵</p>
<p>方式及裝置法</p>
<p>天綫之種類，大别爲二：一曰屋外天綫，各種高架式屬之，一曰屋内天綫，環狀式等屬之。茲分述如後：</p>
<h3>（苐一圖）１２３４５６</h3>
<p>（A）屋外天綫　（一）單標式　單根式天線，（如圖一）爲天線中之最普通者，牂置便利，佔地不多，圖中1爲豎桿，可以堅實之竹木爲之，發電站多用鐵製，高約十公尺，愈高愈佳，，2爲絶緣子·以玻璃質者爲上，市間有售，瓷質者次之、普通裝電燈用之三線白料，亦可代用，但效力較遜、3爲天線，可用十八號裸銅線，長約二十至五十公尺，市市售之天線，係以七根二十二號銅線排成，又有外面鍍錫之一種，可免風雨侵蝕之虞，有包皮之銅線，亦可爲天線之用，效果相同，但徒增無謂之重量耳、4爲引入線，可用普通皮線，一端接天線，一端引入收音機，各線連接之處，應用錫　固，旣減通電阻力，又免生鏽寬弛、引入線爲天線之一部不宜太長，否則選擇性不佳、與房屋牆壁接觸處，須以絶緣物隔之、5爲天線與絶緣子間之　連接線，可用繩子或鉛線爲之、6爲滑車，7爲扯線，備天線升落之用，便檢視也、</p>
<p>無綫電常識</p>
<h3>（三）電流之分類</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>電流雖是電子之流，但是牠的流法，却有種種不同。譬如有一根導線，電流從一端甲，流向他端乙，流的方向始終不變，大小常是一定，這就呌做直流，丨丨純粹的直流。反之，電流的方向，忽自甲至乙，忽自乙至甲，方向時時變易，而其大小，亦隨時而變，這就呌做交流。自甲至乙時，電流由○以至最大值，在後又減小以至○。于是電流反向，亦由○以至最大值，又减小以至○。如此往復不絶，若每秒間往復的次數少，就成低週率的交流電，普通所用電燈電流，均爲交流，其往復次數，每秒不過五十至六十。交流收音機所聞哄哄之聲（Hum　）即由于此。若往復次數多，便成振盪電流。無線電之振盪電流則每秒間件返常在數萬以至數萬萬以上。（往返次數，就是週率）。</p>
<p>如把乾電池陰陽二極，接以電線，則電流流通，如把此線，忽拆忽接，時時斷績，則電流時流時息，可是仍是單方向的，仍是直流，不過間歇的流動罷了。交流亦然，如忽斷忽續，即成爲間歇的。</p>
<p>又設在有直流電流通之電線上，更加以交流，則電流方向雖不變，但電流大小依照交流週率而變更，例如無線電用之眞空管，其屏極至絲極（詳後）之線路，本接以直流，但接交電波後，即有交流同流于所接導線之上，在此導綫上所流之電流，乃爲直流之含有交流成分者。</p>
<p>此外交流與振盪電流，又可分爲等幅的與减幅的。所謂等幅，即電流的最大值，常常相等。所謂减幅，則電流漸漸減少，卒至于零。如舊式無線電報火花間隙式所用的即爲減幅而間歇的振盪電流。而現在用眞空管所發生的振動電流，則爲等幅的和連續的。</p>
<p>又若設法使所發生的振盪電流，其大小之值，時時變更，有時甚大，有時最小，則成爲不規則的振盪電流。這就呌做郮幅。如使電流大小的變更，而能同各種聲者的高低疾徐相一致，那末，傳遞聲音，就不是難事了。下列各圖爲表示各種電流的圖式。横線之上下代裝電流方向，曲線之高低代表電流之大小，如直流大小始終不變，故去横線上方，形成一直線。而交流則形式一曲線。（此項曲線名在弦曲線）調幅後的振盪電流，則如圖G形成高低不等的曲線了。　　尙有二三交流互相重疊以及交流整流後的情形，這裏不再詳述。</p>

<h3>電之單位（二）</h3>
<p>— 均</p>
<p>（三）電壓之單位</p>
<p>水之所以從甲處流至乙處，由於甲乙兩處勢能（即壓力）之差。電學上亦將電從甲處流至乙處之原因，歸之於電之勢能（即電勢）之差，稱爲勢差（Potential　Diference）,惟在電工學上則通稱爲電壓（Voltage），在某種意義上又稱爲電動力（Electric　Motive　Force）。電壓的單位呌做弗（Volt）。弗是由力與能等單位誘導出來的，其關係如下：</p>
<p>達（Dvne）：力之單位，爲作用於一克物質使生一秒糎的加速度之力。</p>
<p>厄（Erg）：功或能之單位，爲一達之力移動一糎之功或其所具之能。厄之千萬倍爲朱（Jonle）。弗：電壓之單位，爲一庫之電量在電勢較高之甲處與在電勢較低之乙處，兩者所有的能相差一朱之電壓。</p>
<p>衛斯吞電池（Weston's　cell）之電動力在攝氏二十度時約爲一·○一八三弗，故實用上計算電壓都可以比爲標準。</p>
<p>電壓或電動力在公式中用字母V或E表之。</p>
<p>計量較大或較小之電壓，另有數種單位：</p>
<p>（符號kV）=一千弗</p>
<p>（符號mV）＝千分之一弗</p>
<p>（符號uV）＝百萬分之一弗</p>

<h3>科學猜奬可得收音機一座</h3>
<p>本埠交通大學主辦之鐵道工業展覽會，行將開幕，聞華商中華無線電研究社，曾被邀參加陳列國貨無線電機，有聲電影機，及一切出品。該社在展覽期内爲酬答參觀來賓及鼓勵國人研究無線電起見，舉辦科學猜奬大贈品，無論何人均可免費應猜，頭二奬可得精美收音機一座。法以該社自製可變電容器一隻，任休猜測此器之電容量，以最近似之數值作爲頭奬，並附小奬多種，欲知詳細情形者，可向該社營業部（大陸商場三一四號電話九三三九○）詢問可也。</p>
<h3>奥地利的警備無綫電台</h3>
<p>在奥地利有些地方，很早已有完備的警備廣播電台之設置，現則已普及全國。此種警備廣播電台，只設在一個地方，但可以與其他地方的短波播音台相連絡，所以奥地利的警察，他們可以很快的播送信息，而不致擾亂其他電波。（飛利浦社）</p>
<h3>德國無綫電聽衆的增加</h3>
<p>德國的無綫電聽者近來增加很快，在去年十月只有四·○七七·三四七·的聽者登記過，到今年一月就增加爲四·三○七·七二二了，在短短的三個月之中，就增加了二三○·三七五人。這可以看到德國無線電事業的進步。不過在去年夏季，却曾有一度的减少。（飛利浦社）</p>
<p>内外消息</p>
<p>飛歌之新式無線電機</p>
<p>無線電收音要免除雜音的擾亂，是很容易的；若有新電臺，電力增加，則收聽他處，尤難分隔。在目前的廣播情形中的選音方法，惟有平衡無極外差式，可以免除此等弊病。飛歌無線電所以能够接音清澈，就是利用此平衡無極外差式之故·</p>
<p>飛歌無線電至一九三二年，已臻至極鞏固的地位，資本雄厚，出品優良，現每日要製成一二，五○○隻的收音機，已爲一切大實騐室，以至專門家，及工程師等所採用。再者飛歌無線電公司，尙繼續其研究工作，如無線電視等。將來的發展不可限量。</p>
<p>飛歌無線電公司的發行所，及陳列室，現設於南京路九十六號，聞前往參觀者，極受歡迎云。</p>
<p>大華四燈收音機之暢銷</p>
<p>本埠三馬路九號大華無線電公司經售之萬金牌四燈收音機爲最新式長方形，用六脚燈砲電力方棚高四寸，久用不熱，不易燒壞，線路整潔，喇叭可靠，「堪稱優等品質」且價額低廉，故每日往購者甚爲踴躍云。</p>
<p>美國聨邦無線電公司之新機</p>
<p>美國印地安那州馬立翁聨邦無線電公司（Ｔhe　United　States　Radio　and　TeleisVion　Cordofation）新出尤愛斯收音機多種，據云構造極佳，卽五燈機中亦裝有最新式眞空管兩具：一爲Ｎo.57用電21/2磅之簾柵放大五極管比較No.24簾柵極效力尤大；一爲No５８　２１／２磅三簾柵極超控制放大器，配以最新式用電一安培之燈絲極。在九燈機中，除整流管外，均用最新式之燈泡。十二燈機則完全用最新式之燈泡製成。並附有No.82水銀蒸氣整流管一具。前次芝加哥無線電出品展覧會中所陳列之收音機，内有此種新式燈泡者，尙只限於十二或十三燈機也。</p>
<p>解决收音機之困難</p>
<p>收音機發生困難時，其顯著之弊病，則爲不響。至若機内發生雜聲，爆烈，若斷若續，忽高忽低，混亂怪聲等，則此收音機内部，已發生嚴重困難，更可想見。原來收音機内部，線路繁多，機件複雜，　加審視，不易知其困難之癥結。此購置收音機者，在每遇此困難時，莫不引爲苦痛之事。本埠仁記路二十五號，亞達公司，爲解决收音機之困難起見，特設修理部，聘請前開洛公司，惠勒公司，無線電總工程師，徐志方君主持，專代各界修理各種收音機。無論發生何種嚴重困難，皆能限期修理完好。取價旣極低廉，並可出立保單，保證滿意。並聞該公司，新近運到大批發達牌高等收音機，機件耐固，發音清晰，售價公道，各界之前往購置者甚多云。</p>
<h3>一年來馬可尼無線電公司之成就（續）</h3>
<p>— 丹</p>
<p>（三）海上無線電應用的增加</p>
<p>在這一年中，海陸兩用無線電話的技術，亦有相當的進步，航海家應用之是很便利而又可靠，現在普通船上，幾乎都已裝置，這種樣式的海上無綫電機了。</p>
<p>海上的指向方法，每年都有驚人的進步，可說是現在研究中最爲有用的部分，報告詳細情形的馬可尼自動無綫電，在烏沙加海岸，於一年中增設了三個，一九三○年在中國海上海附近的一島上，曾設立過的二個馬可尼的船標，去年，在揚子江口岸附近，及揚子江的各重要航路，也都有增設了，</p>
<p>第一個馬可尼旋轉指向標，應用於藍貢港（Ｖolt</p>
<p>Meter）形式簡單，並未配置無線電，但是在應用上是狠便利，</p>
<p>一種新的海上無線電，在不列顚總郵局應用，是完全成功了，十一個不列顚海邊電台，都由郵政總局爲之裝置馬可尼無線電話機，以便與裝有簡單的電話機的船隻通問，裝有此種電話機的船隻，現在已有一三隻之多。</p>

<h3>閩南收音之成績</h3>
<p>— 鄭閣宇</p>
<p>這回從上海回到故鄉本來準備着一只成績很好的五管機但是因爲出口問題被海關禁止放行所以只得拿了另一個二管機眞空管零件放在袋子裏混了過去，而把那五管機擱置滬上。</p>
<p>到了目的地（厦門鼓浪嶼）就把這些零件設法裝配成了一個三回路再生式三燈機。</p>
<p>天線是向朋友借了一根長不到三十尺的漆包線用二根竹竿及玻璃絶緣子，南北向的裝置在二層樓的頂上。引入線用十八號皮線　接於天線的北部，至實騐室地線則用二十二號鍍　鐵絲埋於深約一尺的砂土地，耗阻頗大，收音成績爲之遜色不少。但地位情形，經濟關係，不得不使然耳！</p>
<p>收音機裝置後，约在下午四時的時候，即着手試騐收聽。接上地線時，旋轉可變電容器的度盤，ＸＧＯＡ南京大電台和台灣ＪＦＡＫ，東京ＩＯＡＫ，菲律賓ＫＺＲＭ幾播音台在聽筒内發出很清晣響亮的聲音。接上天線以後，喇叭裏也可清楚響亮的聽見。入夜以後ＸＧＹ浙江省電台，上海亞美公司，大中華，東方，中西也可以用喇叭收音。還有許多不知牠呼號的日語，滬語，粤語播音台。茲將收音機及電原部分品說明如下：</p>

<h3>塞爾維亞農民裸體禳災</h3>
<p>— 瞻盧</p>
<p>丨世界異　歌謠之五丨</p>
<p>新日月如鈎照農家鄉間大會開無遮；不敎疫癘來侵入，惟有裸體可驅邪。十二男子無瑕玉，十二安女子玉無瑕；博得父老之同意，沿街歌唱聲咿啞。「註一」不著一絲表聖潔，手挽耕　排成列；借着娟娟明月光照徹肌冰與膚雪。雪作膚兮冰作飢，夜行那有狂夫欺；縱與途人相邂逅，人必正立而敬之。未許穢語相調謔，未許饞眼相偷窺；有不敬者術不騐，疫癘將如蔓草滋。丨「註一」如此禳災世罕有，巴爾幹鳥無其偶；塞國農人迷信多，裸男裸女歌且走。歌且走兮去又回，疫鬼不逃奚爲哉？疫鬼避裸如避敵，疫鬼逃裸如逃災；裸體萬能信有之，疫鬼疫鬼休徘徊。丨「註三」</p>
<p>「註一」塞爾維亞農民逐疫，常擇鄉里共認爲潔白無瑕的男女各十二人，在新月初上時，裸體游行農村一周。</p>
<p>「註二」游行的時候，不許觀衆說穢語，不許觀衆用輕薄的眼光向他們偷視，否則，便不能禳災，而且，這瘟疫或許變本加厲。</p>
<p>「註三」逐疫歌的大意，是說：「疫鬼快跑　疫鬼快跑！你見了我們的裸體游行，你便站足不牢。」</p>
<h3>關於「打」</h3>
<p>— 小卒</p>
<p>打從手。古人造字的時候，分明告訴我們：「打」是須得動手的。但是，時過境遷，什麽都進化了，於是「打一也有了種種不同的方式。</p>
<p>老和尙盤起脚來，在蒲團上一聲不響，呌做「打坐」。我們工作疲勞了，伏在桌上假寐片刻，呌做「打盹」。這兩種「打」法大槪是「打」中最鎭靜的了。</p>
<p>僧道沿門索食，通稱爲「打齋飯」：實際雖同乞丐一般無二，但名義上畢竟冠冕得多。</p>
<p>言語詼諧，戲狎取笑，呌「打諢」，上海人又呌「打棚」。涉訟呌「打官司」，打官司便是兩造到法庭上去辯論，有錢的可請律師代辯。這二者都是靠嘴巴來「打」的。文人筆戰，呌「打筆墨官司」，武器是文字。</p>
<p>我國自罹國難以來，無日不在大打特打中。試看：嚴令鎭靜，打也，學的是「打坐」「打盹」的打法。忙着内戰，當然是「打」，向國聨哀求，亦打也，與「打齋飯」同。宣言抵抗，提出抗議，不消說，是嘴巴和文字的「打」。至於熱湯大呼守土，結果拿了錢溜之大吉，這種打法，只好歸入「打棚」一類了。</p>
<p>老是亂打，是打不出生路的。忠勇的將士早已在前線動手打仗；我們身爲後盾的國人，不能再空口嚷「打」了，也該動手：有錢的解開囊槖！有力的荷槍殺敵去！</p>
<h3>都市的夜</h3>
<p>— 朱瘦桐</p>
<p>坦直的馬路中間，懸掛了許多光燄萬丈的街燈，遠遠地望去，彷彿一串夜光的明珠。兩旁的年紅光，顯出那嬌艶的顔色，照耀着陳列在玻璃窗裏的白金的手錶，五色燦爛的摩登衣料，以及其他一切的少年用品，越發的可愛，使得那路人眼光，不由地接受了它們的吸引。挽着手臂，緩緩徐行的愛侣們，在那裏停步注視了良久，少女淺笑地細語了一會，雙雙走進了那　店舖裏去了；於是靜靜地等待人們垂愛的物品，很幸運地地了伊的玉臂，或擁抱在伊的懷中，隨着革履碎步的聲音，一刹那間便也消逝了。</p>
<p>在街頭躑躅，度慣飄泊生涯的人們，有的藉着酒的力量，麻醉他的意志，得到暫時的安慰：有的斜戴的帽子，兩手揷入褲袋的中間，嘴裏不住地呈呈作聲，吹出各種自己悅耳的曲調：也有手捧着報紙，很靜默的呆立在墻角的近傍，目送着風馳電掣般的車影。鳩形鵠面的貧窮兒，一面尾隨在行人的後面，說了許多好話，要想討得一二枚銅元；一面留心着遺棄在地上的殘餘的烟頭，狂吸着土耳其，埃及，佛及尼埃等等各種不同樣的烟味，讀者諸君們，你們要深深地記得，在這裏，我們可以認出許多是曩年豪華不可一世的前身。</p>

<h3>薦頭店</h3>
<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>誰不曉得吃飯是件難事尤其是找尋一隻飯碗難之又難、像歐美號稱富强國家可是没飯碗來找尋飯碗的朋友還是成千成萬、自然生在破落戶的我們中國要找尋一隻飯碗更是難於登天了！</p>
<p>的確我們中國人比任何國人來得聰明、日　本的女子對於貞操問題是馬馬虎虎的甚麽「待合所」便是日本的女子待人家來「合」的塲所我們略懂得日本妓界的情形誰都知道有「等合所」這個名詞、我們中國的女子倒不肯明明到「待合所」去不過跑跑「肉莊」吧了、究竟吃飯問題比性的問題要緊於是乎馬路上便開了許多「待飯店」、</p>
<p>待飯店這名詞還是在下創造的蘇州人上海人呌做「薦頭店」、我們在各馬路裏常常可以瞧見白底紅字的招牌上面寫着甚麽「姑蘇金××老薦頭店」「維揚李××老薦頭店」等字樣；和他們的高隣甚麽「清虚道院」「上清宫」「玄虚觀」「包唸喧卷」「兼定本灘」……等招牌：左右輝映、</p>
<p>因爲薦頭店老板爲救濟没飯吃的婦女起見所以請這批没飯吃的女子陳列在一間小小客堂裏面：老的少的；醜的妍的：大塊頭的小大姐的；雞皮鶴髮的妖形怪狀的：都爲了找不着飯碗情情願願陳列在這裏以便老板或老板娘來選擇而得着一隻飯碗、</p>
<p>據說：平津的薦頭店其中很有黑幕也許是「待合所」的變相、上海地方很文明一切不妨持公開的秘密態度薦頭店當然毋須例外、同時在下又得着一個感想便是我們男子在失業漩渦　曷勿有幾位仁人君子來創辦「行長薦頭店」「買辦薦頭店」「校長薦頭店」「委員薦頭店」「做官薦頭店」……使天下人人都捧金雕玉琢的飯碗啊！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張根水</p>
<p>第二回陋室結芳鄰暗欽健叟權家擇良伴痛詆貧娃</p>
<p>積之聽哥哥所說的這些話，未免過重一點。便道：我也並有做什麽見不得人的事情。不過送東西到他家去做，或者取東西回來。厚之道：爲什麽要這樣勤快，家裏不有聽差可以使喚嗎？你去也罷了，還要把他引了來。一個人在社會上做事，交朋友最要緊，有道是近朱者赤，近墨者黑，你老是和楊家老姑娘來來往往，還做得什麽好事出來。我們這種人家，不能讓這種貧丫頭老往屋子裏跑。積之本來還想分辯兩句，一看哥哥神氣十分嚴重，手上拿着烟捲，只管彈灰，若和哥哥頂撞起來，哥哥眞會打人，只好挺挺直直的，站在院子裏。厚之道：你打算怎麽辦？非抱這件衣服，穿給老姑娘看上一看不可嗎？積之一看這情形，料着現在是不能出門，只得走回屋子裏去。約莫有十分鐘，女僕就在院裏喊着二爺吃飯。積之只得把身上藍布罩袍脫了，走到堂屋裏來。到了堂屋裏時，哥嫂和姪子們，已經坐着吃飯了。自己在下方坐着，慢慢的扶起筷子，低頭吃飯，甘太太坐在上方，就不住的向他身上打量着。問題：二爺不是新做得了一件藍布罩袍嗎？積之不敢做聲。厚之冷笑一聲道：我没有想到你跟我多少年，倒是這樣子不長進。那個老姑娘，臉上擦得紅紅的，終日在海甸街上亂跑，這幾條街上，那個不認得老姑娘。這幸而他是住在鄉下，要是住在北京城裏，這成了什麽人，還不是滿跑胡同的交際之花嗎？我倒並不是看窮人不起，窮要窮得有志氣。像老姑娘家裏這樣的窮法，我眞不贊成。他瞧我是個河工局長，你是個二老爺就特别的巴結。他當着你的面，也許會裝出一點大姑娘的樣子，不在你當面，我想還不是對人說，甘家怎樣和他好，甘二爺又怎樣和他好嗎？（二二）</p>

<h3>都會咖啡樓</h3>
<p>— 張若夻</p>
<p>明明是初春天氣，寒暑表上却標着初夏的熱度。感覺敏銳的少女們，換上了絨繩衫，兩朶天然的薔薇花透出金山蘋菓的紅光，覆垂在濃密睫毛下的兩顆活躍的水晶球，迸射出異樣的火熖。那在春風中飄蕩的鬚影吓，使我想起了故詩人劉大白的遺詩來了：</p>
<p>春風你爲甚吹動伊底雙鬢</p>
<p>伊底鬢亂了</p>
<p>我底心也亂了</p>
<p>春風你爲甚吹動我底心</p>
<p>春風我底心動了</p>
<p>你怎地又不動了</p>
<p>這樣地困人天氣</p>
<p>怎敎我不沈沈入夢</p>
<p>白天坐在靠街的小樓裏埋頭執筆，單調重複的文字工作，呌人感到頭腦昏沈欲睡。那街頭顔色衣裳的閃影，擾亂了我的文思。索性放下鵝毛管，掛了一根手杖，到霞飛路上去散步，從下午二三點鐘一直走到黄昏時分，渾身覺得煖得舒服，軟綿綿像是浸在温泉的熱波中一樣</p>
<p>太陽没落了，已經成了霓虹燈的世界。</p>
<p>推進二丈多高的玻璃門，鼻管嗅着巧克力和奶油的氣味。拾級上樓，蓄音器止放播「晚安維也納」，歡迎我孤單的一個契丹顧客，揀了靠馬路的窗口，懶洋洋地坐下休息，四個厚化妝的白俄侍女，凄白的顔，綺麗的春袍，據着一隻長方形的桌子，正在燈光下作葉子戲。</p>
<p>我的手杖滑到地上去了，驚醒伊們的靜穆空氣。那個像東方馬利亞型顔的第二號侍女，過來倒了一盞咖啡。</p>
<p>第一號含着微笑的侍女，許久没有在這家「都會咖啡樓」上漏臉了，或許是跟了一個白俄洋行小鬼私奔了吧？</p>
<p>像哥倫布發現了新大陸般的歡喜，無意中我看見一個西班牙香烟女工卡門式的側影，伊是一個「新來的」，我正注視着伊雙鬢間揷着的鮮艶的海棠，好像是發覺了我在偷視伊，伊嫣然一笑。「春風吓，你爲甚吹動我的心？」</p>
<p>我只施用一個眼色，伊擺動着游蕩纖長的腰肢，踏出跳舞步伐，挺着健美的姿態，放出一雙饑渴的炬火，操着不準確的法蘭西語，問我要什麽東西。</p>
<p>「若使你願意，請來一杯伏特加（白乾燒）」</p>
<p>「伏特加？」</p>
<p>「正是。」</p>
<p>伊愛嬌地又是姃然一笑，下樓去了。</p>
<p>一直等候了十分鐘，伊空手上樓來了。正在猜疑伊爲甚不把酒瓶和杯盞過來。那不規則的法語又放音了。</p>
<p>「伏特加來了！」</p>
<p>「在什麽地方？」</p>
<p>「在樓下！」</p>
<p>「在樓下？我要下去嗎？」</p>
<p>我便帶着好奇心起身，伊陪了我一同下樓，一股濃烈的香水精夾着西洋女人特有的狐臭，好像嗅聞到軋士林同樣的刺戟。等到走到樓下糖菓店堂，伊指着玻璃門外停着一部出差汽車的時候，我才如迷夢中醒了轉來。啊！原來聰敏面孔笨肚腸的白俄侍女，伊把「伏特加」聽錯了當作「摩托卡」！</p>
<p>我裝作没有事的樣子，在帳台上付了一杯咖啡的代價，從容不迫的走進汽車座裏。呌車夫在霞飛路上莫名其妙地繞了一個圈子，再回到距離「都會咖啡樓」不到三百步路我寄寓的銀葉小樓。</p>
<p>春風吓！你爲甚反覆地把人作弄？</p>

<h3>「中庸之道」</h3>
<p>— 程雲萍</p>
<p>本來，要找一條不左不右的「中庸之道」，是一樁很困難的事。可是，聰明乖巧的中國人，却慣會找着這條路。譬如當一樁什麽發生了的時候，你去探問人家的意見，那答語準是旣不這樣也不那樣，四顧茫茫，不着邊際，他恰是站在「這樣」與「那樣」的中間。又如你若問：中國應否對日本宣戰？應否以武力收復失地？那答語又準是：當然……然而……談鋒一轉，順口一溜，結語便自然而然的是精誠團結，一致對外！應宣戰呢？不應宣戰呢？那才只有「天曉得」。</p>
<p>然而假如眞的一旦宣戰，而且結局勝利，自然他是主戰的功臣；假如結局不幸而失敗，他也不失爲先覺，因爲他早就說過，然而…原應該縝密審愼到今朝不幸而言果中。</p>
<p>我的天，這是如何安穏的一條道路啊！</p>
<p>實在，在這年頭，表示自己的主張，也是一樁很不容易的事。譬如政見，你右一點，雖然討得一部分人稱爲穏健，但也難免不被駡爲落伍，腐化！反之，左一點，雖然討得一部分人稱爲進步，却也難免不被指爲反動，惡化！只有站在「中庸之道上」不左不右，對新派搖頭，對舊派嘆氣，「穏健」與「進步」，兼而有之自然可以左右逢源，無往而不適。</p>
<p>所謂「中庸之道」，換言之，便是「騎牆派」。但天下大槪没有那麽一個長脚的人，可以騎在牆上兩脚都能脚踏實地吧？騎在牆頭的朋友，如果偶不小心，一交翻將下來，誰能擔保不會跌個手斷脚折，狗血淋頭呢？</p>

<h3>磨坊裏</h3>
<p>— 裘鵬</p>
<p>磨坊裏充滿着黑暗和潮濕。</p>
<p>騾兒戴着眼罩，圍着那具沉重的石磨不停地走着。一具弓形的木套緊緊地扣在它的背脊上，兩條鐵鍊連接着木套和磨柄，使那笨重的石磨隨着它的進展而迴旋。趕騾兒的鞭子不時像雨點似的灑落到騾兒的背上。騾兒的世界裏没有光，没有一切活的有生氣的聲和色：它所感到的，只有兩種永恒不變的陰沉的慘怖的聲音：石磨發出的喳喳的呌聲，趕騾兒的粗暴的叱喝。</p>
<p>日子久了，它感覺到疲乏。它覺得後面那個石磨一天天加重，那扣在背脊上的木套一天天加緊。它剛把脚步放慢點，想停下來歇歇，但立刻，它便聽到一聲怒吼，沉重的一鞭隨着又降落在它的身上。</p>
<p>它流着汗，喘息着繼續前進，它想掙脫了這眼罩，掙脫了這鐐銬似的木套，躍進另一個光明的世界裏去，獲得自由和幸福，但沉重的石磨，把它壓迫得太利害，它疲倦，衰頽，再没有絲毫的力最去掙扎，反抗。它祇好失望的悲鳴着繼續前進。</p>
<p>磨了一圈又一圈，過了一天又一天，那緊扣在它背脊上的木套巳把它的脊蓋擦破了一個窟窿，殷紅的血潛流着；它全身的肌肉一天天收縮起來，它那四條粗壯的腿，現在變得像四株柔弱的草幹，那麽無力的移動着……終於有一天，在暴烈的呼叱下，在雨點似的鞭擊下，它陡地感到眼前一陣花，隨着四肢便不自主的彎曲下去，躺倒在地上。</p>
<p>它現刻在作着夢，它彷彿已經變成一隻長着美麗的捲毛的叭兒狗，偎在一個貴婦人的懷裏·是那麽温馨地，甜美地……</p>

<p>戀愛的官司，當局者還打不清，旁人更無從置喙。我們所知道的，盧布朗夫人原是富於熱情的女性。她非常崇拜盧騷，每讀各時代的天才的歷史，便想作那位天才的妻子。她自己說，就她的趣味和本性論，她不應當作人家的妻子。她之所以和梅特林同居，第一個念頭是想使梅特林幸福。祇要使梅特林幸福，就是犧牲她自己的幸福，她也願意。因她愛梅特林比愛她自己還甚。她很知道大凡有天才的人，本不容易接近，她却相信她自己有抵抗天才的暴風雨的力量。本來她自己也是一個聰頴不覊的人，她除唱歌外，能寫詩和小品文字，而且對於英文寫說俱佳。她十七歲的時候，在巴黎奏藝，租有一所房子。她的房子等於火車站，没有住食的藝術家，常投奔到她那裏去。她收留過買不起鋼琴的琴師，没錢買畫布的畫家，無人僱定的歌女，找不着出版處的著述家等等。</p>
<p>她的那本「迴憶錄」，其中有許多地方，對梅特林自然是體無完膚的攻擊。頂瑣屑的事，也拿來作攻擊的材料，梅特林本來對於小動物也有極深厚的同情·但她在「迴憶錄」的首章中，卽說梅特林最喜歡的是狗，最討厭的是猫。梅特林曾告訴她說猫是最不貞節的東西。她很詫異梅特林爲什麽相信這一類的傳說。後來同居的時候，梅特林居然用手槍打死了她最愛的一匹貓。因爲有一天那匹猫在花園裏呌得很厲害，梅特林聽得膩煩，便打開窗戶向她說，我想打死牠。她以爲是說笑話；隨後碎的一聲，彈子正打在猫的眼睛裏，猫躺在地上了，可是牠的眼睛還釘視着他們倆。哈利在「梅特林的生涯及其作品」中，則說這種殘酷的　出自梅特林之手，很難使他相信。凡讀過梅特林的「花的智慧」和蜜蜂　的或白蟻的生活的論文的，都知道梅特林對於各種極微小的動植物有着極深的愛。他舉出一樁事作反駁的證據：有一次他同梅特林到一處地方，看見一匹猫被一個惡作劇的人用繩子繫在　口上，猫正在用死力掙扎，想咬斷繩子逃走。梅特林趕忙走近去，從口袋裏拿出裁紙刀將繩子砍斷，猫不顧死活的從梅特林的頭上跳過，猫爪在梅特林的額上劃了一條傷痕，險些弄傷了梅特林的眼睛。但是梅特林毫不在意。這可見梅特林對於小動物何等疼愛。</p>
<p>迴憶錄」中還有一些地方也不容易使人加以肯定。她責梅特林盜取她的思想作文章，又不寫出她的名字。有一天天氣很熱，他們倆跪在松樹下看蟻穴，梅特林拿一根棒和蟻惡作劇，她忽然不由己的質問梅特林爲什麽在「謙卑者的寶藏」中常引用她的話，祗說是一個老哲學家說的或是一個老朋友說的，或簡簡單單的用一個引用符號。梅特林抬起頭來很詫異的樣子回答着：「寫出你的名字，那會惹人笑，你是演劇的，你是一個歌女，人不會相信我了。」梅特林著的「智慧與運命，」據她說梅特林自己也承認剿襲了她的思想。一八九八年，這書將出版的時候，她的哥哥曾勸梅特林署兩人的名字，梅特林以爲還是在書前寫幾句獻詞作獻給盧布朗夫人的好。但這獻詞在一九二六年的新版本上被刪掉了。盧布朗夫人極不以爲然。她說，就是兩人的愛情没有了，或是現在厭惡以前的愛情，也不應該把這獻詞刪掉。</p>
<p>現在順便述一述梅特林的出身，和他在劇曲史上的地位。梅特林一八六二年八月二十九日生於比利時的幹（Ｇand）城。幼時在聖巴爾蒲（Ｓaint</p>
<p>Barbe）中學肄業，卽篤好文學。後來因順從他父母的意思，在幹城大學習法律。一八八六年正式執行律師的業務。在那年，他去巴黎，無意間和幾位有名的象徵派詩人相遇，就中最使他傾倒的是瑋里耶。他和幾位朋友在珈琲店裏聽瑋里耶關於文藝上的談話，有時聽到天光才回到旅館裏去，因此堅定了他對於文藝的志願，而他的作品便走向主情的象徵的神秘的方面去了。他的第一部詩集「温室」，刋於一八八九年，是象徵人性脆弱的抒情詩集。第二年發表第二部劇曲「瑪蓮公主」米爾波（Ｍirbeau）贊他爲比利時的莎士比亞。</p>
<p>本來自然主義支配了近代的舞臺，例如易卜生史特林堡小仲馬諸人的作品，都曾風靡一世，直到一八九○年前後才産生新浪漫派劇曲的運動。這運動雖因各國作家的個性不同，所表現的形式亦因之不同，但他們的根本精神則均置重於官感以上的事物，力求闡明生合的本相，注重情緒過於理智，注重心靈過於物質，注重主觀過於客觀。梅特林自屬新浪漫派的巨擘。雖有人懷疑他百年以後在劇曲史上或占不到現在這麽優越的位置，但他有他的不可動搖的位置，我想無論誰也會承認的。梅特林是戲劇的詩人，同時是思想家。他的論文集如「謙卑者的寳藏」，「智慧與運命」，「蜜蜂　的生活」，「埋没了的寺院」，「二重花園」，「花的智慧」，「死」，「戰爭的殘物」，「陌生生的客人」，「山中的小徑」，白蟻的生活」等，均充分地發揮了他思想家的面目。（完）</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張貫平</p>
<p>「老曹告訴你的，是不是？」</p>
<p>「………………………………………………」</p>
<p>她只是笑，不做聲了。</p>
<p>「昨天我陪我的一位親戚到公園裏去她了一回，給老曹看見了便造謠生事。…………」</p>
<p>「眞的也好，假的也好，横竪林先生遣個好人物，爭不到手了，也没資格來爭了。」</p>
<p>她說着，低下頭去微笑。</p>
<p>海泉想，這是什麽話喲，這裏是不便久坐了的。自己和她只是第二次見面，她便那樣地表示親　，好像相處了幾個年頭的朋友一樣。無論如何，她對於自己的態度是欠妥的。</p>
<p>「老曹還没有回來，我要走了。下半天再來看你們吧。」</p>
<p>「林先生，你那樣地討厭我？世光不在家，怎麽我也没資格代表他？林先生大看不起人了喲！」</p>
<p>「曹太太，……」</p>
<p>「你那樣地稱呼我，我不喜歡！……」</p>
<p>她不待他的話說完，撒嬌般地裝出不高興的神氣。她抱着的小孩子本來是含着她的右邊的乳房，此刻她再露出了她的左乳房，一對乳房完全露出來了。海泉原望着她說話的。他料不到她竟有這樣的示威運動，像受着一種威脅，不敢抬起頭來了。</p>
<p>「那末，要怎樣地稱呼你才好？」</p>
<p>「總之，用那樣老古董的名稱呌我，我不喜歡！」</p>
<p>「那，呌你做嫂嫂好麽？」</p>
<p>他笑着問，同時禁不住要偷望了一下她的袒露了出來的全胸部了。</p>
<p>祇一刻他又暗暗地自責了一下，忙翻向另一方面去了。</p>
<p>「那隨便。你最好呌我的名字。大家都是朋友喲。」</p>
<p>「我不知道你的名字。」</p>
<p>「我姓華名秋英。你就呌我秋英好了。」</p>
<p>「那豈敢。……」</p>
<p>他倆的視線碰着了。她又向他作了一陣的媚笑。</p>
<p>在這時候，海泉意識着自己之不長進了。他想自己的心靈是何等的軟弱啊！若據自己的主觀的分類，在自己所認識的許多女性中，當然是首推佩珠爲第一人，丨丨最高潔的女性。她的姊姊佩珍爲第二人，丨丨但她有了一個缺點是和那個巨人到跳舞塲去過來。卓淑華是第三人。鶴子夫人是第四人。至於這位曹世光夫人，算是最劣等的了。以上海泉平日所主張的理想的女性分類法，雖然帶有點主觀的或封建的品評，但是無可如何的。崇高的女性始終是優於一般的女性。不過從另一方面說，他覺得女性的引誘力恰恰又和他的理想相反，若論捕捉男性的魅力程度來分類，那末，上述的順列便要逆倒過來。他此刻發見了他自己的矛盾了。他對於這個矛盾立卽加以一個客觀的　辨。他對於佩珠似乎只是有崇仰，思慕，而缺少愛慾的念頭。但對於鶴子夫人及華秋英一類的女性，只感著她們的魅力異常的强烈，容易爲她們所煽動，而對她們作肉的追求。最後他達到了一個結論，卽是，能以佩珠一類的女性爲正式的妻，而另與鶴子夫人一類的女性結單純的愛慾的交際。這是最理想的性愛的生活吧。這决不是海泉的創見，而是法國的社會主義者傅立葉提倡過來的。</p>

<p>哈瓦斯二十四日華盛頓電　一般人以爲英國大使林德賽之見國務卿赫爾、係受英政府之囑、英政府因最近得到之消息、互相矛盾、故欲確知羅斯福總統對戰債問題之見地、究竟如何、衆人推測、赫爾或對林德賽言及取銷關稅壁壘問題、謂「禁止外貨進口」之關稅、足以妨害國際商務、故目下問題首在廢除此種關稅、一般人以爲此種問題、如能先行解决、則於戰債必有良好之影響、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十四日華盛頓電　本日國務卿赫爾與英國大使林德賽談話時、赫爾將低减關稅問題、與戰債問題相提並論、可見日後與歐洲債務國會商債務問題時、美國對於一切修改戰債之要求、均願予以考慮、惟以各債務國允許低　關稅、　世界經濟會議得以成功爲條件、</p>

<h3>法報頗多訾議</h3>
<p>路透社二十四日巴黎電　英相麥唐納今日在下院宣述渠此次赴日内瓦羅馬巴黎之結果、法國報紙對於麥氏所言、多加訾議、如巴黎迴聲報曰、慫恿報復、徒足鼓勵希特勒與墨索里尼之狄克推多肆虐耳、法報深恐英意所取之步驟、將引起修正和約、法報堅稱法國尙未準備及此云、英保守黨員邱吉爾所主外交事務應由尋常外交機關辦理之、其言殊反對麥氏之歐陸談判、而法國則大加稱讚、</p>
<p>路透社二十四日柏林電　德國政界評論昨日英相麥唐納在下院所發之演說、稱爲「非常冷靜」、足證法國已拒絶意相墨索里尼所提議之四强協定、政治觀察家玩讀麥氏之演詞、覺其語氣與麥氏在羅馬所表示之樂觀、大不相同、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十四日南斯拉夫京城電　英相麥唐納昨日對下院之演說、使此間人士大爲震驚、一般人謂就小協商各國而論、並無所謂修改條約、且國聨會盟約第十條、保障簽字各國領土之完整、又謂麥相在羅馬巴黎及倫敦宣言、頗有參差、究竟麥氏眞意若何、希望渠能確切言之、以免人心惶惑云、</p>

<p>蘇俄通告</p>
<h3>禁用日本漁夫</h3>
<p>日俄邦交上之重大影響</p>
<p>據十九日大阪朝日新聞載稱、最近蘇俄對於北洋漁業、力謀積極發展、日前施行八年度漁區競爭、俄國尤爲猛烈、顧北洋漁業、自日俄勢力逆轉、俄方對於所僱日本人漁業勞動者、每年逐漸减少、因此勞動問題、早已引起非常恐慌、不料俄國今又突然通告、本年度禁止僱傭日人漁業勞動者、此通告已由海參崴利遊利商會轉致函館分行、即由該分行通知漁業廳互助會社員、互助會乃派代表進京、向内務省社會局·外務省·農林省駐日蘇俄大使館通商部代表部·各方請願、倘蘇俄不肯收回成命、則蘇俄國營漁場之日本人蟹工船勞動者二千二百餘名、亦必同時失業、故蘇俄此次强行自主的漁業政策在日俄邦交上恐將發生重大影響云、</p>
<h3>英國的經濟恐慌與失業（續）</h3>
<p>英國在業工人的現狀又怎樣呢、一九三一年　學時所允諾的、年年新年時必付一張「人人獲得麵包和勞動」的支票他們可看見兌現了没有呢、完全没有這麽一回事、工人們所得到的、而是減低工資、失業和短工、</p>
<p>一九三二年英國工人所失却的工資總額、不下一千三百萬鎊、交通工人共失却總工資三二五○○○○鎊、爲損失之最大者、其次、紡織工人的工資共减去三二○○○○○鎊、建築工人的工資共减去二四二五○○○鎊、公共機關職員的工資共减去一一四○○○○鎊、農村工人所失却的工資、約共六○○○○○鎊、鋼鐵工人的工資、被減削者、達四七二○○○鎊、水電瓦斯工人的工資、被減削者達二八七五○○鎊、裁衣工人損失工資二八五○○○鎊、五金工人（上述的鋼鐵工人除外）損失二五七五○○鎊、造船業工人損失二四二五○○鎊、木材工人損失二一○○○○鎊、鑛工損失一○○七五○鎊、陶業和化學工人損失一○○○○○鎊、等等、</p>
<p>但是這些數字尙不足以表示一九三二年工資减少的實際情形、因爲勞工部所揭示的工資之低落、都是指某一工資糾紛後、或工資交涉後所發生的工資减低而言、例如上面鑛工工資所損失的數目、便不包括去年在一切炭坑中起很大作用的「包工標準」和「鎊重標準」之减低的、許多其他的經濟部門也都如此、試一研究一九三二年英國之生産統計、不難看出英國生産額、在不斷地和疊進地降低、至第四季而降低的速率愈大、我們以一九二四年英國産量等於一○○、則得下面的指數、</p>
<p>一九三○年第一季　　一一○·九</p>
<p>一九三二年第一季　　　九五·○</p>
<p>一九三二年第二季　　　九四·三</p>
<p>一九三二年第三季　　　八六·九</p>
<p>（一九三二年第四季的指數現在還没有）研究出口數字的結果、也可以看出出口量的减低、</p>
<p>英國商品出口（每月平均的鎊數）</p>
<p>一九二四　　六六七○○○○○</p>
<p>九二九　　　七○○○○○○○</p>
<p>一九三一　　三二四○○○○○</p>
<p>一九三二　　三○四○○○○○</p>
<p>纔發表的一九三三年一月的數字、</p>
<p>當然表現更大的减少、</p>
<p>英國在在業工人和失業者的名下、確省即不少的金錢、一九三二年將在歷史上成爲最「節省」的一年、一九三二年暴　着自殺者、入瘋人院者、死亡者等等之數字日益增加、生育大加减少、一九三三年以足以充分揭出勞苦羣衆營養不良的流行病開始、在本年最初的五個星期中、死於流行病者達七千餘人、（完）</p>

<h3>汪氏談話</h3>
<p>孫氏訪汪辭出後、汪曾親自送出、旋向新聲社記者發表談話、謂本人自向中央辭職、并提議請宋繼任、來滬後、即前往訪宋、請其眞除、但宋因處理財政、責任亦極繁重、故對行政院長一職、絶不能兼就、因之中央仍令本人擔任、今晨孫來此晤談、結果决定對行政院長問題、俟今晚或明晚入京商議後、再另决定一適當之晚或明晚入京商議後、再另决定一適當之繼任人選、倘仍無適當人選、則是否由本人復職、當再商定、至與蔣委員長會晤時地、因事關軍事、暫難發表、其語氣間似辭意已可打消矣、</p>

<p>日帝國主義者，以其鷹犬爪牙，丨丨軍閥，任意來踏遍我東北半壁河山，撕碎國際盟約，破壞世界和平，乃不知究何有於傀儡溥儀？何厚於傀儡溥儀？一面以窮凶極惡之猙獰面孔與手段向我奪取版土，一面又慨然强加黃袍於傀儡之身，把他揪上前台，猶美其名曰：僞「滿洲新國家之執政」！若非日本别具陰謀，襲用亡韓故智，并欲緩和國際空氣，以掩護其侵略野心，古今中外，寗有此滑稽之事？</p>
<p>然事出意料之外，異族侵人，利用家賊，勿論局勢如何惡劣，公然竟有張邦昌吳三桂一類的家賊，靦然不自知恥，甘爲異族走狗，寗非咄咄怪事！</p>
<p>在目前日軍閥正趾高氣揚，大發洩其獸性於我長城邊際，亦即我國人　聲遙聞，悲憤塡膺之時，日昨忽有一高貴之客，新自歐洲貴幹得意而返，自命乃一新國家（？）之堂堂代表丁逆士源，光臨敝埠，且不惜以塊然高貴之軀，深匿厠所，至時餘之奇聞鬨載於各報，此一高貴之客，原擬在滬躭擱一週，繼續盡其走狗義務再向旅滬外僑，極力詆毁祖國内政爲日辯護其侵略政策，惟結果不知何故，此一高貴之客，突又躡手躡脚地悄悄北上，却很值得我們的注意，到底是爲了日内瓦，倫敦，巴黎，諸地的頂子把他碰傷了，不再有勇氣來滬張其臭口，放其臭屁了呢？抑爲觸境睹物，恍然動衷，無面目以對祖國河山，以見祖國父老？或因滬上多我國及韓國之愛國志士，屢次炸案之殷鑒，那得不呌丁逆寒膽驚心，爲其狗命打算，三十六着，還是溜之大吉？上述原因，丁逆必難逃其一，然皆足以促成丁逆垂頭喪氣，皮酥骨軟地不惟要亟亟北上，且驚日記者之訪問，久匿厠所，飽聞異香，甘之若飴，蓋情勢使然也！</p>
<p>嗚呼丁逆丨尊疊何辜？在歐洲各地，剛剛碰了頂子，嗆了白灰的舊創，猶恐尙未新愈；而今又飽饗以厠所中之奇香妙味，且至時餘之久一眞所謂天作孽猶可違自作孽不可活」</p>
<h3>駁敎育界控張之電籌成</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>閱本月十七日本報新聞欄，本市敎育界江恒源倪文亞楊衛玉等三百二十餘人，聨名致電國民政府行政監察兩院與軍委會，請將新近辭職來滬，各要人紛往飛機塲歡迎之張學良將軍，明正典刑，不禁忿火中燒，而歎此等書獃子不明事理而胡閙，情願替張將軍作義務律師而申辯，爰將對於該電嚴如下：（一）中華民國者，四萬七千萬國民所共有，政府决心長期抵抗，擬有整個計畫，是對外宣傳所用的文言，全賴全體國民爲後盾，關外義勇軍頗多，儘可與日苦戰於冰天雪地中，何得謂「邊疆重任，完全寄諸張學良一人，」况且東三省之易五色國旗爲靑天白日滿地紅國旗者，係輔導國民黨在東北之活動，日軍初攻北大營，張氏臥病北平，無能爲力，此次侵熱，無論成敗，部下爲國犧牲者亦已萬計，早經張氏於本月十一日通告全國同志電内所說明，江恒源等豈未閱報而假充不知耶，故尙有「張學良世受國家豢養，無論爲國捐軀，固分所應爾」等官冕語，（二）打高而夫球與跳舞，係現代靑年正當之游戲，張氏爲英國大文豪蕭伯訥認爲中國靑年中最有希望之將軍，自應學習以便交際，順承王府係將軍掌北門鎖論之辦公處，位於北平，不便遷移，何得謂其「平日聲色玩好，優游舊都，軍國大事，置諸度外，」（三）此次承德失守，實由湯玉麟平素逼民種烟横徵暴歛，尅扣軍餉，致民怨沸騰，兵不用命，遂扣汽車挾艶妾而遠遁，湯係張之父執，張又遠在北平，烏知前線如是腐敗，且事後早經大怒而電請中央將湯治罪，何得以「敵人西犯，時未經旬，即全線潰退，而責其所任何事，」（四）張雖辭職，然才堪大用，故蔣委員長恐其出洋，有尙有借重等語，勸其留滬，何應欽在平告誡部屬，亦謂張受環境關係，赴滬休養，不久欲回，某某，等恐其寂寞，則伴其吃飯，各方如是推重，而電中有「爲張學良個人計，早經愧憤自殺」等語，并駡其「寡廉鮮恥」，而謂「明正典刑，爲最低限度，」不特侮辱大員，并且唆使自殺，殺頭係極刑，尙謂爲最低限度，豈俗語所謂殺了頭尙欲充軍乎，望敎育界三百二十餘書獃子，以後不可如是胡鬧，否則恐有未便，</p>

<p>帷幄無人用岳飛，諸賢莫與衆心達，長安卿相多憂畏，汝輩少年那得知，</p>
<p>敲門惟有徵租吏，市肆蕭疏民力癉，羽檄未聞傳塞外，將軍不戰空臨邊，</p>

<p>羽檄聨翩晝夜馳，歡情略似欲殘棋，遺民淚盡胡塵裏，猶是中原無事時，</p>

<h3>中國需要「性」的敎育片</h3>
<p>— 娜夫</p>
<p>在中國，缺乏「性」的敎育是無可諱言的。兒童一産下來；以至成人。父母没有對他們說過一句關於「性」的話，甚至進了學校，敎師也没有給他們受「性」的敎育的洗禮。故此中國的兒童對於「性」的智識一點也没有。從前的情形是如此。</p>
<p>就是現在，所謂文明比較前從進步的現在，雖則敎育方面已經有注意到這個問題，同時，自海禁開後受了歐西的文化影響，對於這問題却已走上開禁的路了。但這只是城市方面是如此。如果一進鄉村，所謂「男女授受不親」的現象還没有破除的，更無所謂「性」的敎育了。就在城市方面來看，也不過只能夠抛開舊禮敎的觀念罷了，對於「性的」的敎育仍然談不上。</p>
<p>所以·如果要使一般人明瞭「性」那問題，一方面固然要在學校敎育方面着手，可是中國的敎育旣然未能普及·故此只可另謀别路來圖帮助補救，這所謂另一方面而且比較有普遍性的，丨算是電影了。</p>
<p>假如能夠在電影上下「性」的敎育的工夫，不祇兒童能得到「性」的智識，同時可使迷夢在舊禮敎的人們獲得相當的了解。這樣一來，他們（指没有受過性的敎育的人，而現在已爲人父母者）自然會把從前認爲神秘的「性」的問題，看作不神不秘地去敎導他們的兒女了。</p>
<p>我們關心電影敎育，「性」敎育的同志們，以及製片公司的執事們呵！對於這個問題，你們是應該負責的。你們以爲怎樣呢？</p>
<h3>醫院中</h3>
<p>— 克武</p>
<p>慘痛的象徵常會發現在這小小的醫院中；這些黑鬼似的廠裏的工人，軋去一個手指，或者一隻手，那是慣常的悲劇。有些很美麗的姑娘，來醫治下身的病症，打一針六零六，那也是天天有的事。壞脚壞手，簡實每天要治幾十個；但是在醫院多是一幕幕的悲劇，除了有幾個年輕的姑娘來醫治凍瘡，同着醫生們發出一聲嬌聲，或者調笑的聲浪，那是偶然的喜劇吧。</p>
<p>下午了丨上午看了七八十號施診的穿着白色診察衣的醫生，看護小姐們也有些倦意了，多懶懶的躺在椅裏看報子；</p>
<p>「看什麽病」？</p>
<p>「先生！她吃了生雅片烟」！男人代她說了。</p>
<p>「吃多少？甚麽時候吃的」？醫生把着脈問着。</p>
<p>「一共買了四角的烟，吃了一半，早晨吃的」！</p>
<p>「現在頭暈，肚裏難過吧」？</p>
<p>「唉！是的！先生！」她哀聲的。</p>
<p>於是醫生便用了硫酸銅充了一大杯的蒸溜水給她吃，没一刻她嘔吐了，白水吃了又吐，吐了又吃，但是没有把雅片吐出。醫生不住的診察她的温度與脈。</p>
<p>「她爲什麽要吃雅片呢」？</p>
<p>「我不在家，她同她的婆吵閙起來，婆說她是個只吃不會做，只會　麻將的壞貨，因此她同婆駡起來；婆便要趕她出去，不要她登在家裏，她一急便吃了雅片……」這男人涎沬花噴着說了出她吃雅片的原因。</p>
<p>「喔！那是件小事！現在好點吧」！</p>
<p>「先生稍好一點」！</p>
<p>「不要緊，我給你打一針好了」！於是醫生吩咐看護拿阿忒羅品（Ａtropin）給她打了一針，叮囑她是不會有危險的，現在回去多吃些濃茶或者咖啡茶。</p>
<p>一算藥費是五塊錢，男人付了，他扶地走着蹌跟步去了。醫院裏又沈寂了。</p>

<h3>組織小家庭</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我棄學就商，已經十易寒暑；每月的收入，至今還只有十八元。慈愛的母親，不幸於去秋逝世；現在祗有一位年老的父親了。我是四年前結婚的，早已生産了一個小孩子，現下正在學步時代：而第二個小孩子，不久却又要呱呱　地了。除此之外，我還有三個弟姊。所以日常開支，就不省了。幸有父親從中調度。得以一年一年的度過。我的岳家，並不住在上海；我妻子呢，又要常常歸寗，這筆川資另用，實在使我非常爲難。不料她近來異想天開，要求我在她娘家的附近，組織小家庭。要是答應她吧，十八塊錢一月的收入，那裏夠用。而且風燭殘年的老父，也要無人侍奉，我也不忍做此不孝的行爲。但是不答應她吧，那末……實在難說……總之拗不過她。現在惟有請你替我想一個法子。使我們可以過安樂的日子：這是我竭誠希望的呀！</p>
<p>禱　謹上</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>編者按：近年來因爲這個「大家庭與「小家庭」的問題，已經引起了許多人的討論；他們的結論，多不約而同的贊成組織小家庭。大家庭的編制，硬要把兄弟伯叔妯娌等一大串的利害不相同的人，强合在一起，誠然是大可不必，且且在這種編制之下，的確可以把我們的生活興趣，葬送盡凈。但是我們以爲没有自助力的父母弟妹，目下却不能將他揮之家庭組織之外。我們的理由是；（一）在物質方面没有解决的父母弟妹，你要去扶養他，這是法律所規定的義務。（二）即使你的父母兄妹，他們物質方面，已可得到解决：但是你也不能不照顧他們。因爲人的生存，在物質之外，還需要精神的慰藉，尤其是這一般無自助力的老年人與未成年的弟妹們。孔夫子講「孝」道裏頭，曾經說過下面幾句話；他說「至於鳥獸，皆能有養；不敬，何以别乎。」就是這個意思呀！在習慣過「小家庭」生活的歐美各國，一個人一方面不負扶養佼母的義務，另一方面，没有受兒女扶養的權利。在習慣過「大家庭」生活的中國，一個人一方面負扶養佼母的義務，另一方面，享兒女扶養的權利。表面看來，似乎完全不同，但是論其權益義務，彼此都是相當的。但能受子女們的是我們假使要從「大家庭」小家庭」，那末一定要有一代人，肯犧牲；他一方要扶養他的父母，一方却不由嘴裏喊着「扶養。這種犧牲者，應當變一制而爲「改造社會」者的人們去做，不應該呌他爺老子去做的。我們希望自命爲「改造社會」的靑年，一方面履行他法律上規定的義務，對於父母弟妹，必恭必敬的去扶養；一方面在物質上精神上作相當準備，到得自己老的時候，物質上精神上都有解决，用不著累你們的子女，來扶養你。萬不可現在借着「小家庭」的美名，作爲卸責的護符，到了自己老的時候，又要翻過來呌你們的子女養呀！</p>
<p>卜君的老父，照來信看來，實在有「非卜君無以終餘年之槪」：所以以不組小家庭爲宜。况且你的經濟方面，似乎還得到他老人家的帮助，更其不能輕舉妄動。至於你不答應你夫人的要求，實在無甚爲難。要知「妻以夫的住所爲住所」與「已嫁女子，對於翁姑，須有相當敬禮」，都是法律規定的。弄到後來，祇有她拗不過你，没有你拗不過她的道理。但是家庭之間，「和爲貴」，所以開始須從「勸」字入手：萬一她眞的不聽，才可用「拗」的辦法呢。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（十二續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「不不！你來得正好，他們管他們，我可不忙啊快坐下來」麥娥自己先在一張大沙發上坐了，就讓伍逸坐在她的旁邊，一個女下人便移過了一張極精巧的小几子，安在他們兩人的中間；另外又有一個女孩子，捧過了二個玻璃杯來：一杯是深紅色的濃茶，就安在伍逸的前面，一杯是乳白色的流質，是給麥娥自己喝的。</p>
<p>伍逸正待舉起那一杯紅茶來吸，忽然給麥娥奪了過去，却把她自己面前一杯牛妨似的東西授將過來。</p>
<p>「你的嘴唇上没擦過口脂嗎？怎樣這般紅法？」麥娥斜睨着他的嘴唇，很頑皮地笑着，却不使他有答辯的餘地，又搶一般的說下去了。「但是我知道這是你肚子裏太熱的緣故。那末這是馬乳，我們自己家裏喂着的馬的乳水，眞是最凉清的東西。你喝罷！」更不讓他有做一番謙遜的假客套，麥娥已把那玻璃杯送到了他的嘴唇上來，汨汨地灌着。</p>
<p>「多謝你！」伍逸覺得這一杯馬乳的滋味，眞比瓊漿玉液更甘美，忙不住的稱謝；兩個眸子却不敢旋過去，看麥娥，儘射在對面的牆上。</p>
<p>牆上，在四條××館主，××閣主具名的字畫的左邊，掛着一方小小的照相，丨丨那是林大平的照相，照相上的林大平眸子，似乎比平常尖銳了許多，伍逸的視線和他一接觸，便立刻像給人家兜頭澆了一盆冰水一樣，竟有些不寒而慄起來。</p>
<p>「謝什麽！我很歡喜你能夠每天來喝，這裏儘多着咧！」果然，那女孩子又捧了一杯馬乳來遞給麥娥了。</p>
<p>「每天來喝…………？」伍逸暗暗地默忖着「這怕使使不得嗎？要如給林大平知道了，臉上可不好看！」當時雖然這樣想，第二天却就身不由自主的走到了麥家來，一直流連到五點打過二十分鐘，估量林太平該來了，才像敗軍之將一般的棄甲曳兵而走。</p>
<p>誠然，伍逸的人物和性格，確有使林大平相形見絀的地方，而他的雄健的談鋒，更絶不費事的投合了麥娥的所好；兩個人所抱的見解和主意，往往又是站在一條線上的，這樣就輕輕地搆成了一副三角戀愛的模型。</p>
<p>這樣三角對持的僵局，竟出乎意外的維持了兩年以上，理由很單純，完全是伍逸進攻不力的緣故。然而這般不上不下的局勢，反使林大平格外的痛苦，他努力在失望中掙扎着，故意抹殺了自己的靈性，忍氣吞聲的死命抓住着原有的地位，不敢放鬆。</p>
<p>某一年的聖誕節的早上，七點鐘，伍逸兀是高臥未起，忽然有人送了一包禮物來。那量個極精美的彩盒。他的下人說：</p>
<p>「送東西來的人還在樓下候着，說是要回信。」</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting Outside Lengkou</h3>
<p>Enemy Attacked Shanshenmiao and Majiagou, But Were Repelled</p>
<p>Our Troops Occupied Highlands in the Gaolipu Area</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Personally Supervised the Battle at the Front Lines</p>
<p>(Qian'an, [Prefecture])遷安 Telephone. Outside Lengkou, at dawn on the 24th, the enemy, with superior forces in a combined land and air operation, launched fierce attacks on our positions at Shanshenmiao, Majiagou, and Gaolipu. Our troops calmly responded to the battle. When the enemy approached the positions, our soldiers leaped out of the trenches and engaged the enemy in close combat. The enemy advanced and retreated repeatedly. The enemy continued to reinforce their troops, and we also increased our forces, launching attacks from both flanks, repelling the enemy from Shanshenmiao and Majiagou, and occupying the highlands. We captured three armored vehicles. At the same time, the enemy at Gaolipu was surrounded and annihilated by our forces. The battle quieted down in the afternoon. Many soldiers were bombed to death by enemy aircraft, a truly tragic scene. As a result of days of intense fighting, morale is high. All the wounded soldiers have been continuously transported to the rear. However, due to transportation difficulties, only over twenty of the seriously wounded were sent to Tangshan via Guo Le on the 24th. Jianchangying suffered heavy losses from enemy air raids. Many telecommunications lines were bombed and cut off, but our troops are repairing them at any time. [Illegible characters] on the 23rd night rushed to the front to supervise the battle. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping)秦島 Telephone. Shang Zhen personally went to Lengkou this morning to supervise the battle. Last night, in the Xiaojiaying area outside Lengkou, the enemy, using heavy artillery and tanks as cover, launched a fierce assault on our positions. Extremely intense fighting broke out between the two sides. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Commander Huang telegraphed from [Youshi, 5-7 PM] on the 23rd, stating that our [Illegible characters] Regiment [Illegible characters] Battalion, yesterday, via Sidaohe, carried out a flanking maneuver on the enemy's right side. Arriving at the highlands southeast of Gaolipu at 4:00 AM this morning, they immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy. By around 9:00 AM, they had repelled the enemy and occupied the highlands in the Gaolipu area. Our [Illegible characters] Regiment [Illegible characters] Battalion, last night, carried out a flanking maneuver on the enemy's left side from Longwangmiao. Due to the long distance and enemy air interference, by 4:00 PM this afternoon, they had driven out the enemy near Yingtaoyuan and occupied the area. On the front, starting from 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy gradually increased their forces. After dawn, enemy artillery fire intensified. The highlands near Madaogou were lost and regained repeatedly. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Enemy aircraft were exceptionally active today, constantly forming several groups of three or four planes, taking turns bombing our positions and the Jianchangying area outside Lengkou. Orders have been given to the [Illegible characters] Battalion to continue flanking the enemy tonight. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kailu Telegram. On the morning of the 23rd, the enemy continued to attack our positions at Madaogou. The fighting was extremely fierce. We suffered many casualties, and the enemy suffered even more. From morning to dusk, enemy aircraft, in separate teams, took turns bombing Jianchangying, Lengkou, Madaogou, and other places. Our positions are very secure, and morale is extremely high. Both sides are facing off at Xiaojiayingzi. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zunhua Telegram. On the 22nd and 23rd, there was no fighting in the Xifengkou, Luowenyu, and Shanzhayu areas.

(24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qian'an Telegram. On the 22nd, over two thousand enemy infantry and cavalry, using several tanks as cover, attacked our Majiagou position outside Lengkou. The position was gained and lost twice but was ultimately repelled by our forces. Over twenty enemy soldiers were captured, and a large quantity of military supplies was seized. Two of our company commanders were killed in action. In the Gaolipu area on the afternoon of the 23rd, several hundred enemy soldiers were spotted and surrounded by our forces. All of them were captured on the evening of the 23rd. Several enemy aircraft bombed Jianchangying, causing great damage. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Shifu, Director of Song Zheyuan's Office in Beiping, stated that the Japanese are spreading rumors that are absolutely unbelievable. Malanguan, Malanyu, Panjiakou, Dongjiakou, and other places are all within our defense lines. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Outside Lengkou at Makou, there are over thirty enemy armored vehicles, providing cover for over a thousand infantry, advancing towards us. They made contact with our forward infantry units on the morning of the 23rd. Today's battle is extremely fierce. The enemy launched two attacks outside Luowenyu, both of which were repelled, abandoning a large quantity of military supplies. They are currently constructing fortifications in the Fengbishan and Foyeyai area, facing off against us. On the 23rd, the enemy moved two regiments westward to attack Lengshuitou. This morning, they were still in contact with our troops. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xifengkou Telephone. The enemy at Banbishan in Luowenyu has added another company. Enemy plainclothes soldiers are constantly harassing us and firing artillery. The enemy at Xifengkou has retreated over forty li. There were no enemy aircraft today. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Enemy Establishes an Airfield in Chengde</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy has established an airfield in Chengde and has been constantly conducting reconnaissance and bombing operations against counties south of the Great Wall. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tang Yulin Seeks to Redeem Himself Through Merit</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Tang Yulin retreated to Fengning, he recently sent a representative, Li Shuchun, to appeal to various parties. Li has met with He and Zhu Qinglan several times. The authorities are showing understanding towards Tang's attempt to redeem himself through merit. Zhu has also provided relief to Tang's troops. It is reported that Tang's returning subordinates have reached over thirty thousand men and have been reorganized into several brigades. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Not Boasting in Victory, Not Concealing Defeat</h3>
<p>The Republic of China, with its vast territory and abundant resources, is succumbing to the control of tiny Japan, with its border regions under constant threat. If our people do not strive to strengthen ourselves, there is no way to avert this crisis. Recently, the Beiping military authorities announced to the nation their attitude towards the war: "Not boasting in victory, not concealing defeat," and used this as the standard for reporting the true situation of the war. This is indeed an essential statement.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident and the loss of the three northeastern provinces, our country should have learned a painful lesson and strived to rise up from danger. However, unexpectedly, the past year and more has been carelessly wasted, allowing the enemy to seize another opportunity. The 580,000 square li of Rehe has fallen at once. How can mere weeping and bloodshed be enough? Therefore, today, there is no path to national salvation other than fighting with all our might. It is difficult not to boast in victory, but even more difficult not to conceal defeat. For to conceal defeat is to lose heart and to be afraid to continue fighting. Since the opening of China to foreign trade, occasional victories have led to boasting and complacency, while minor defeats have been concealed at all costs. From the Opium War in 1840 to the Boxer Rebellion, defeats were first concealed and then peace was negotiated. Although the situation was extremely critical at that time, it was still possible to survive in the balance of power among the great powers. But today, even survival is impossible. The only option is to seek the way of attack and defense. Not boasting in victory cannot be achieved overnight, but not concealing defeat is something our people should strive to do. Only by not concealing defeat can we fight again. We especially hope that our people will strive for two things: (1) Reviving the Strength of the National Economy Modern warfare not only involves three-dimensional tactics but also requires the combined strength of the entire nation. Therefore, the ultimate victory or defeat is not determined by cannons and airplanes but by the strength of the entire national economy. The people of our country have reached the point of exhaustion. From now on, the only goal should be to solve the three major difficulties of food, shelter, and clothing for the general population amidst all difficulties, so that the final victory can be maintained.</p>
<p>(2) Implementing conscription and unifying the military system How can randomly recruited soldiers be expected to love their country and resist foreign enemies? Even breaking up local power and abolishing private armies cannot be achieved without implementing a conscription system.</p>
<p>As for manufacturing weapons and rigorous training, although they are important plans, they are ultimately technical matters. If a solid foundation can be laid, training and manufacturing will not be too difficult. Not concealing defeat is something that everyone must do in the face of our country's great crisis, showing their ability not to be discouraged by defeat and rebuilding their homeland. This is evident from historical precedents. Zeng Guofan's battles against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were often met with setbacks and near annihilation, and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had occupied the southeast and controlled the Yangtze River provinces. Beijing was only one step away. Yet, in the end, Nanjing was conquered. How could the decaying Qing Dynasty sustain itself in this way? It was because the generals leading the troops, although repeatedly frustrated and humiliated, repeatedly rose up to face the enemy and continued to fight, thus achieving their personal success. The Qing Dynasty was able to maintain its rule for several more decades. As for international warfare, the situation is even more serious, and the spiritual strength of the people is its most important core. Consider World War I. At the beginning of the war, the German army was so fierce that it seemed to be able to conquer mountains and overturn the sea, swallowing France in one gulp. However, France fought back with all its might, again and again. During the four years of war, the French army was almost defeated in every battle, and a quarter of French territory was turned into a battlefield. However, the French people never succumbed to defeat and instead became more determined. As a result, the German army retreated and France won. After the Great Revolution, Soviet Russia was blockaded by foreign powers and invaded by the White Russians. The foundation of the country was not solid, and the people's hearts were not at peace. There was war abroad and enemies at home. Yet, they were able to persevere and lay the foundation for a new country, also because they were not discouraged by defeat and continued to work hard.</p>
<p>The enemy facing our country today, although stronger than the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom during the Qing Dynasty, is weaker than Germany before the war, and even weaker than Britain and the United States during the war. As for our country's situation, it still has the advantages of vast territory and a large population compared to France during the war and a better scale than Soviet Russia at the time of the revolution. Even if the war spreads and causes much suffering, in order to fight for the future survival of the nation, we must rise up and fight with all our might and never fear defeat. This is the time.</p>

<p>Japan Fails to Surrender Mandated Islands</p>
<h3>United States to Protest Seriously</h3>
<p>State Department Preparing to Take Joint Action with League of Nations</p>
<p>Japan Violates Treaties by Building Military Fortresses on the Islands</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, key US political figures stated that if Japan continues to insist on retaining the right to the mandated islands in the Pacific after withdrawing from the League of Nations, the United States is expected to issue a strong protest. However, since it is not yet the time to announce any policy, this protest will be temporarily reserved. It is reported that those close to the President claim that the United States has always insisted on participating in the disposal of former German colonies because it fought together in the European War. It is also heard that the State Department is closely watching this matter and is preparing to coordinate with the League of Nations while also protesting to Japan alone, because President Wilson first proposed the idea of ​​trusteeship. When President Wilson spoke on behalf of the Allied Powers six days before the armistice, urging the Germans to lay down their arms, he announced the Fourteen Points, the fifth of which was about the Allied Powers agreeing to deal with all colonial demands with sincerity. Since then, the United States has insisted that German colonies belong to the Allied Powers, not to the League of Nations. Therefore, it is heard that when the US government protests in the future, it will regard the League of Nations as merely a distribution mechanism, and the United States initially did not approve of Japan's trusteeship until the Washington Conference in 1922, when it accepted Japan's position as a trustee state, but still with conditions, especially regarding the prohibition of establishing fortresses. Therefore, if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations and then establishes fortresses on the islands, it will be considered a violation of the treaty. It is heard that the State Department has notified the League of Nations of this situation but has decided not to issue a formal protest for the time being. It is expected that before the protest is issued, Davis will first discuss it with the member states of the League of Nations in Geneva. As for the best solution for the United States regarding the mandated islands after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, well-informed sources claim that it would be preferable for them to be returned to the League of Nations.

<h3>Advocating Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Sending Proposals to the League of Nations Administrative Council and Governments of Various Countries</p>
<p>Appealing for Implementation of Article Sixteen of the Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Peace Bureau Council has sent the following proposals to the member states of the League of Nations Administrative Council and the governments of various countries: The League of Nations General Assembly’s judgment on February 24 regarding Japan's actions as a violation of the League of Nations Covenant is deeply satisfying to the conscience of all humankind, and the International Peace Bureau is greatly pleased. However, this judgment should not be regarded as a mere formality. Now that Japan's responsibility has been clearly defined, the member states of the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact should take effective measures. The Council believes that the member states of the League of Nations should fulfill the Covenant they have signed. Not only should Articles Ten and Fifteen of the Covenant be adopted, but also the spirit of Article Sixteen of the Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact should be invoked. The methods are as follows: (1) Sever all commercial and financial relations with Japan; (2) Prohibit the supply of all kinds of military equipment and raw materials necessary for the manufacture of military equipment to Japan; (3) Prohibit Japan from borrowing money or issuing public bonds; (4) Prohibit private individuals from engaging in commercial relations with the Japanese government and the Japanese people, and prohibit the import of Japanese goods; (5) Strictly abide by Article Ten of the Covenant, safeguard the integrity of China's territory, and not recognize "Manchukuo" or have any relations with it; (6) Recall diplomatic representatives stationed in Japan; (7) Provide China with all kinds of assistance in accordance with Article Ten of the Covenant, etc. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Captain Eden stated in the House of Commons today regarding the proposal to prohibit the transportation of arms to the Far East that it is practically impossible to negotiate an international action in a short time, and many countries must obtain powers they do not have today. Judging from Britain's experience in recent weeks, to take such effective action in the future, it is necessary to first establish the machinery for this action. A member of parliament asked if the negotiations in Geneva were proceeding on the basis of the argument for a single ban on the transport of arms to aggressor countries. Eden replied that as far as Britain was concerned, it had initiated a study of the issue of arms shipments to the Far East. This issue must be subject to international study and adjudication in order to be effective. No country can tell another country what to do, etc. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Liu Ruiheng Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Rescue Work is Properly Arranged</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Ruiheng arrived in Nanjing from Ping [Beiping] on the morning of the 24th. According to him, since the enemy troops in Luowenyu were repelled by our counterattack, they have been quite alarmed and have not dared to advance for several days. Currently, the Japanese troops at the key passes of the Great Wall know that we are prepared and do not dare to advance lightly, so there have been no major battles recently. Our side has completed the reorganization of the various units at the front line and can launch a large-scale counteroffensive. As for the transfer of He Zhuguo's troops to defend Pingjin, the people do not understand the strategic relationship, and there are many doubts and rumors. Now that the outside world has understood the truth, the panic has been greatly reduced, and public security should not be a concern. When Rehe was in emergency, the missing doctors are now safely out of danger and working in hospitals in the rear. Medical personnel have also been transferred north from Nanjing, Shanghai, Hunan, and Hubei, and all preparations are sufficient. Even if there is a major battle, there should be no difficulties regarding rescue and treatment. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

According to Liu, except for occasional bombing by Japanese aircraft near Xifengkou, the front line is relatively quiet. When asked about the safety of Pingjin, Liu replied that the recent rumors of unrest in Pingjin were all caused by the exchange of defenses by He Zhuguo's troops in Shanhaiguan, but after official denial, the public's mood gradually stabilized. Liu also said that the several medical officers who were previously reported missing when the Chinese army withdrew from Rehe have now safely arrived in Beiping. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops Continue to Invade</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Expresses Anxiety</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Moscow dispatch: The Pravda newspaper commented on the 22nd, expressing anxiety about Japan's attempt to invade Chahar, saying that the Japanese troops are now only 100 kilometers away from Zhangjiakou. Zhangjiakou is the most important town in Chahar, connecting Inner and Outer Mongolia to the north, North China to the south, and Xinjiang to the west. It is not difficult to predict whether the Japanese army, which has occupied 300,000 square kilometers of territory in ten days, will be able to occupy Zhangjiakou in the near future. The newspaper quoted the Tanaka Memorial and Araki's pamphlet to prove that invading Mongolia is a fixed policy of Japan, believing that it must first start with occupying Zhangjiakou and Dolon. The newspaper also said that the current financial panic in the United States, the rampant Fascist Party in Germany, and Europe and the United States have no time to look east, which has created a favorable situation for Japan to move abroad, etc. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Tieci and Zeng Zhongming returned to Nanjing and said that Wang's health has deteriorated since returning to the country, so he has firmly requested that Song be appointed as the substantive President of the Executive Yuan. Wang himself is very willing to work in the Central Party Headquarters in the capacity of a Standing Committee Member, because the responsibility of the Executive Yuan is heavy and the affairs are complicated, and he is afraid that his sick body will not be able to cope. Although the Central Party Headquarters is also important, it is not as busy as the Executive Yuan. Wang's trip to Shanghai was entirely to personally ask Song to allow him to be substantively appointed, and to treat his illness. After arriving in Shanghai, he telegraphed the Central Standing Committee, requesting that Song be confirmed as the President of the Executive Yuan, and that the word "acting" be removed, so that he could devote himself to serving in the Central Party Headquarters. However, the Central Standing Committee still did not make a concrete decision on the 24th, and also sent Sun Ke and Gu Mengyu to Shanghai with letters signed by all the Central Committee members to persuade Wang to resume his post. Gu took the letter and left first on the morning of the 24th. Sun changed his departure to the evening train because of the Legislative Yuan meeting. According to Zeng's observation, the Central Government was unable to approve his resignation. Wang will remain in Shanghai temporarily, and will come to Nanjing to serve as soon as a decision is made. As for the date of going north to meet Chiang Kai-shek, it has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke said that Wang suffers from diabetes. Since going to Germany for treatment, he has been recovering day by day. Although he feels slightly tired due to the hard journey, it has little to do with his illness. The Central Government believes that the daily deepening of foreign insults requires a concentration of forces to jointly devise a national policy. The affairs of the Executive Yuan are important, and it is still hoped that Wang will preside over the overall plan. It is thought that Wang may be able to accept the unanimous persuasion of his colleagues in the Central Government. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shuren said that the issue of Wang's resignation is not important, because Wang's service to the Central Government is no different from resuming his post. Because the affairs of the Executive Yuan are all handled in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government, the President of the Executive Yuan is unable to cope due to illness and will return to Nanjing for treatment in a few days (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke will go to Shanghai by night train tonight, representing the Central Government to persuade Wang. Ma Chaojun will accompany him. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek intends to take a plane south in the next few days to urge Wang to dispel his resignation and jointly bear the important responsibility of the country. It has not yet been decided whether he will fly to Nanjing or Shanghai. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, a Reuters reporter visited a certain important figure in the National Government, who said that Sun Ke and Yu Youren had proposed a plan to unify China's military to the Central Political Conference, but the plan did not include a request to appoint Chiang Kai-shek as the Commander-in-Chief of China's Army, Navy, and Air Force. All the contradictory rumors circulating outside are fictitious. The important figure concluded that President Wang's trip to Shanghai was purely to persuade Song Ziwen to take the post of President of the Executive Yuan. As for the various rumors circulating outside, they are all unfounded. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Russia Organizes Inspection Team</p>
<h3>To China to Investigate Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The government initiated the organization of an official-merchant joint industry and commerce inspection team to Russia.

<p>Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty</p>
<h3>Both Sides Exchange Opinions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, both sides have begun to exchange opinions on the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty. However, the issue that takes time to discuss is that the Soviet Union's foreign trade is purely state-owned, and China has three ways to deal with this: 1. State-owned, 2. Merchant-operated, 3. Merchant-operated under government supervision and guidance. According to China's economic situation, the third type will be adopted more in the future. As for the non-aggression treaty, which was first proposed by the Soviet Union, it is also in progress at the same time. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Zhu Qinglan</p>
<h3>Returned to Nanjing Via Jinan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Liejun Got off the Train in Jinan</p>
<p>(Jinan) This morning, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Zhengting, and Zhu Qinglan returned to Nanjing via Jinan. Li Liejun got off the train in Jinan. Han went to the station to greet him and boarded Kong's car for a conversation. Kong said that he went to Xifengkou to console the troops on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek and saw that the morale was very high. He originally wanted to go to Gubeikou, but it was stopped due to events in Nanjing. Li said that his trip north was originally to promote everyone's unity against Japan. He observed that the soldiers and civilians in various places were greatly encouraged. Both Feng and Yan advocated actively resisting Japan. With Chiang Kai-shek's arrival in the north, the military situation has become more consolidated, and the war situation has been greatly consolidated. He is currently preparing another battle plan. The people's transportation is no less than when the 19th Route Army fought in Shanghai. What I pay attention to is the opening up of political power, so that the people of the whole country can do their best for national salvation and nation-building. I have talked in detail with Chiang Kai-shek and agree very much. It concerns the fundamental plan of the country. I am now planning to return south and discuss it thoroughly with the government, so as to realize it as soon as possible. The situation has reached this point, and a new path should be opened up in the political aspect to save it. While passing through Jinan, I plan to visit the new administration and visit Chairman Han, Ge Guangting, Yao Yijia, and other friends. I will return to Nanjing tomorrow. Feng is very active in resisting Japan. Li brought his secretary Zhang Bigong and nine senior attendants. Zhang said that after Li met with Chiang and conveyed Feng's intentions, Chiang sent Ma Boyuan with a handwritten letter to visit Feng. Ma returned to Baoding yesterday to report. Feng also gave a concrete reply to Chiang's letter. Li handed it over after the inspection and will make suggestions to the National Defense Council after returning to Nanjing. He will come north again if necessary. Li's proposition of opening up political power is to turn the pessimism of the people of the whole country into optimism, so that new life will occur, and unity against Japan is much greater than the strength of the army. Li said that he was the first to advocate the thorough opening up of speech, and also talked to Chiang about it in Baoding. Han went to the Jiaoji Hotel to visit Li. Zhu Qinglan talked about the war situation at the front, which is indeed very good, the same as reported in the newspapers. However, the soldiers need a lot of shoes to climb the mountains, and I hope that all sectors will donate money to buy shoes. This trip to Nanjing and Shanghai is to raise money for relief work at the front. Kong also said that he will return to Baoding in a few days. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, Li Liejun visited the Thousand Buddha Mountain, Baotu Spring, Daming Lake, the city wall road, and other scenic spots, and visited various constructions. Li returned and told reporters that among the achievements of the provincial governments under the current National Government, Shandong is the best. First, it can maintain local public security, and second, it does not increase the burden on the people. The provinces are not as good as Shandong in these two points. All kinds of politics can meet the needs and habits of the local people. Shandong can be regarded as very good when true democratic politics cannot be achieved. At 5:00 PM, Han hosted a banquet in Zhenzhu Spring, with Li and various important figures accompanying him. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

On February 26, 30,000 to 40,000 people from the pseudo-First Front Army surrounded the division layer by layer in Huangpi. Commander Li personally fought fiercely with the bandits for three days and nights in the heart of the encirclement. He first broke his left arm, then injured his thigh. He ran out of ammunition and had no reinforcements. Finally, he shouted that I, the Commander of the 52nd Division, will kill all the red bandits, and shot himself twice with his pistol and died. His loyal remains were only found in Chongxiang, Yihuang, on the 21st and transported to the province.

<h3>Hitler Announces Political Program</h3>
<p>Achieving Dictatorship and Promoting National Revival</p>
<p>Restoring International Status Through Peaceful Means</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Guomin News Agency) Today, Chancellor Hitler attended the Reichstag and announced his major policies. In his declaration, Hitler began with a comprehensive overview of the German political situation since 1918.</p>
<p>Denouncing Communism He strongly denounced the recent expansion of communism, stating, "The recent burning of the Reichstag building proves that if the Communist Party gains power, national security will absolutely lose its guarantee. Therefore, the entire German people must unite and eliminate the communist poison."</p>
<p>Purpose of Implementing Dictatorship Regarding the dictatorial powers requested by the government, Hitler continued, "The government has no intention of abolishing the autonomy of the states, but within a certain scope, the politics of the nation and the states should establish a unified system. Furthermore, the legislative system should also be reformed, because if the people have to vote as many as twenty times in four years, the value of legislation is lost."</p>
<p>Restoration Not Yet for Discussion As for the issue of restoration, whether or not Germany’s recovery is connected to it is not yet the time for discussion. However, the central government will regard any unilateral action by any state to resolve this issue as a disruption of unity, and the central government will take appropriate measures to deal with it. What the government should do now is to use scientific tools such as newspapers, literature, film, and radio to promote Germany's revival."</p>
<p>Churches are Essential to the State Hitler further stated that the two major Christian churches are essential to the life of the nation.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Private Property Furthermore, the economic foundation of Germany is private enterprise, and private property should receive the strongest guarantee. The current government should avoid any kind of currency reform experiment.</p>
<p>Actively Rescuing Farmers and Workers In addition, rescuing rural areas and restoring the status of unemployed workers in the economic machine are also two major tasks of the government. However, this cannot be done without rigorously implementing economic principles to strengthen the nation. It absolutely cannot be stopped just because it temporarily does not conform to the psychology of the masses.</p>
<p>Vigorously Encouraging Manufacturing Furthermore, in terms of Germany's geography, Germany cannot establish the possibility of a completely self-sufficient nation. Therefore, it must seek outlets for its products. This can start with a sound exchange of goods.</p>
<p>Nationalizing Railways Hitler further stated that Germany's railways must eventually be returned to state ownership.</p>
<p>Establishing a Peaceful Policy Hitler advocated that the government should have absolute authority over the three major policies of internal affairs, foreign affairs, and economy, in order to seek credibility and stability in the political situation. In foreign affairs, it should adopt a policy of generosity and long-term vision to achieve a peaceful path and restore international trust. Furthermore, in economic terms, rational principles should prevail over everything. Whether it is the organization of enterprises or the allocation of debts, reason should be the ultimate goal. Hitler then discussed the issue of disarmament.</p>
<p>Supporting Cooperation Among the Four Powers Hitler stated, "For fourteen years, Germany's military has been disarmed by the powers, and recently Germany has been waiting in the disarmament conference for other countries to equally reduce their military, which has also been fourteen months, but the result is almost zero. Now the United Kingdom has put forward a new plan, and Germany will do its best to support it. And Italy's far-sighted policy, wanting to mediate among the European powers and promote peace, the German government will also support it, because the Germans deeply hope that the harmonious cooperation of the four countries can become a reality." Hitler expressed great gratitude for Italy's inclination and expectations of supporting Germany. He also expressed respect for the Roman Pope.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Relations with France and Russia As for France, he stated, "If both sides have sincere understanding, then a foundation for reconciliation can still be established between the two countries. As for Russia, Germany is extremely willing to maintain its friendly relations, because Germany's internal crackdown on its communist party is Germany's internal matter and will absolutely not be subject to any external interference, nor will it damage Germany's diplomatic relations with other countries."</p>
<p>Indefinite Adjournment of the Reichstag Finally, Hitler spoke about the fate of overseas German expatriates, saying that they are all loyal to the government, which is very commendable. At this point, he asked the Reichstag to choose one of two paths: either to cooperate with the government or to declare war on the government. Subsequently, Wells of the Social Democratic Party stood up and spoke, attempting to prove the legitimacy of the party's attitude in recent years. Thereupon, Hitler rebutted the Social Democratic Party and its undertakings with eloquent arguments, saying, "Those who worship the Third International cannot be allowed to criticize the government." After a brief debate, Speaker Goering announced the indefinite adjournment of the Reichstag. If it is necessary to reconvene, it can be decided by the Speaker.</p>
<p>Reichstag Authorizes Dictatorship Havas, Berlin, 23rd The draft law granting full powers to the government has just been passed by the House of Representatives with 441 votes against 94 votes. In front of the Kroll Opera House (the meeting place of the House of Representatives), there was a sea of people, including thousands of National Socialist Party troops. Upon hearing the news of the passage of the bill, they cheered enthusiastically. Chancellor Hitler stood on the balcony and gave a brief speech to the people, saying that the first step of the National Socialist Party government's program has now been achieved. The people should be loyal to the government so that it can complete its second plan. This plan is to give freedom, honor, and power to the German people, etc. After the passage of this full-powers law, it is tantamount to giving dictatorial power to the government. All parties except the Socialist Party voted in favor of this bill.</p>
<h3>The Fascist Era</h3>
<p>Mussolini Celebrates Success</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 23rd Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said today, while celebrating the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party, that the ambitions we held in the spring of 1919 have now been realized. Fascism has forged Italy into a nation with a unified national will and belief. No threat can shake it. Fascist Italy is now at the pinnacle of a new history and can give its ancient and modern wisdom to other nations and open up an era of Fascist culture.</p>
<h3>Serious Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>House of Peers Discusses Domestic and Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 24th Today's plenary session of the House of Peers opened at 10:18 a.m. First, a resolution, jointly proposed by various factions, was raised to urge the government regarding the current situation. Count Yorinaga Matsudaira (Research) represented the factions and stated the reasons for the proposal, saying that the current situation is extremely critical, and the House hopes that the government will establish policies in domestic and foreign affairs without regret, discuss countermeasures to ensure peace in the Far East, and strive for financial balance, so as to establish a plan for the future, etc. Prime Minister Saitō replied that the purpose of the proposal is deeply understood, and the government will respect this resolution and will certainly live up to expectations. Then, it was unanimously passed and immediately entered the agenda.</p>
<p>Hualian, Tokyo, 24th In order to urge the government to reform and control diplomatic, financial, and ideological issues, the House of Peers submitted a resolution to urge the government in the name of various factions in today's plenary session of the House of Peers. The content is roughly as follows: (1) The established diplomatic policy should be expanded and strengthened based on that policy, and efforts should be made to have various countries recognize Japan's position, and it is imperative to consolidate and establish the fundamental policy of the country's centennial plan. (2) The financial deficit and public debt continue to expand unabated, and the interest on public debt increases. Financial facilities that lack long-term planning cannot be viewed optimistically. The government should immediately implement a consolidated financial countermeasure. (3) Recently, the left and right extremes of thought have penetrated the intellectual community more and more intensely, which is particularly worrying for the future of the country. The government should strictly prevent and fundamentally eliminate them. According to the above proposal, political circles believe that the factions of the House of Peers still indicate that the emergency period has not yet been completely removed, and its content seems to include the intention of retaining the emergency cabinet.</p>
<h3>India-Hong Kong-Japan Air Route</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, New Delhi, 23rd The Indian government announced today that the air routes from India to Hong Kong and Japan have been prepared. The route from India to Hong Kong will be undertaken by a French company, and the route to Japan will be undertaken by a Dutch company.</p>

<p>MacDonald's Speech in Parliament</p>
<h3>Results of Negotiations on the Four-Power Pact</h3>
<p>Nationalist Revival and Treaty Must Be Revised</p>
<p>British Government Begins Drafting Implementation Details</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd British Prime Minister MacDonald delivered a long-awaited speech in the House of Commons today, recounting his trips to Geneva, Rome, and Paris. The Prime Minister said that when he and Foreign Secretary Simon arrived in Geneva, they felt that the Disarmament Conference was in danger of collapsing, because the opinions of all parties differed on the details, and the work could not proceed. They had no choice but to promise Germany equality. Today is no longer the time when the powers can use their united strength to forcibly suppress any European nation and make it submit to obligations that it considers contrary to its honor. He and Foreign Secretary Simon knew very well that what must be made clear now is that the obligations imposed on any country in Europe are honorable and responsible, and, more importantly, that these obligations are voluntarily undertaken. However, the recent events have greatly increased the danger of acting accordingly at present. Therefore, the British plan advocates that equality itself cannot be implemented in the transitional era, but only seeks to no longer prepare for war. Europe is now very uneasy and in a state of extreme panic, but the Disarmament Conference has regained its vitality due to the intervention of him and Foreign Secretary Simon.</p>
<h3>Peace is the Only Goal</h3>
<p>The Prime Minister then spoke of his visit to Rome, saying that after arriving in Rome, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini showed him a short document, intending to launch a four-power cooperation in Europe to maintain peace in the spirit of the non-war pact, and in principle recognized Germany's equal status. The Italian Prime Minister's plan advocates that these four powers agree not to use force to resolve any current political difficulties, and advocates immediately amending the treaty in accordance with Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant. If such a plan can become a convention, then the effective period of this convention will be ten years. Now the British government will draft the details, so that the Italian Prime Minister's plan should take the amendment of the treaty as its only purpose, rather than a general peaceful purpose. When a member asked about the meaning of "revising the treaty and the general purpose of peace," the Prime Minister replied that he meant that this plan not only has the general purpose of peace, but must take the peaceful organization as its main and only purpose. This plan must not exclude the participation of small countries, because small countries have a greater relationship than large countries in some aspects, in order to eliminate the causes of conflict arising from existing treaties. Finally, the Prime Minister said that when the inevitable rise of nationalism makes the peace treaty re-discussed, this kind of plan can prevent the danger of Europe. Soon after, the government issued a responsible explanation for the Prime Minister's statement on amending the treaty and the general purpose of peace, saying that the Prime Minister claimed that the British government will discuss the details of this plan, so that this plan can not only take peace as the general purpose, but also not take amending the treaty as a large and almost the only detail.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Amending the Treaty</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 23rd Prime Minister MacDonald stated the diplomatic situation in the House of Commons, and the venue was crowded. Many diplomatic representatives from various countries also attended. From Prime Minister McDonald's speech, it can be seen that the purpose of the British and Italian authorities is to amend the current treaty, but the immediate procedures for implementation have not yet been determined. McDonald said that Germany's military equipment problem has long been the cause of confusion, and the current difficulties in Europe have all arisen from this. If Europe wants to adopt a policy that can last, it must grant Germany the right to military equality. McDonald used a concise document to explain Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's plan, but he did not involve its implementation details. Its main spirit is that Germany is allowed to cooperate with Britain, France, and Italy, and the three countries guarantee to make concessions to Germany on the principle of military equality in exchange. McDonald advocated that the current treaty needs to be amended based on Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant. If the four countries can cooperate within the scope of the League of Nations, then Britain will consider the methods of implementing the Italian Prime Minister's plan. The only important thing is to amend the treaty. However, McDonald assured all Conservative Party members that amending the treaty would not involve British colonies. If there is any action taken against the small countries, their opinions must be sought first. Before the countries express their opinions, they will never lightly change it. (According to Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant, the General Assembly may at any time ask members of the Federation to review the treaties that are no longer applicable and consider the international situation that may endanger world peace.)</p>
<h3>Concerns of the Right Wing of the Conservative Party</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th The British government's foreign policy stated by Prime Minister MacDonald in the House of Commons is supported by the majority of members of the House of Commons and the press with various political views. However, the right wing of the Conservative Party does not think so, believing that the result of Britain's intervention in Europe may not be good. They would rather Britain adopt a non-interventionist attitude. The question of how the treaty can be amended has obviously not been deeply studied. What is undoubted is that amending the peace treaty will inevitably arouse the opposition of the countries that benefited from 1919, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, which were both produced by this peace treaty. General public opinion believes that the four powers, in addition to giving Germany equal status, cannot act alone, because in order to deal with the complex problem of the Polish Corridor, which is to divide Prussia into two, Poland's cooperation is indispensable. Poland must obtain a way to the sea before it can abandon the corridor. However, if Poland wants to obtain a way to the sea, it will become a dispute involving the small countries of the Baltic Sea. Therefore, dealing with the problem of the corridor is very difficult to start. However, since Hitler regained the German premiership on March 5, several countries in Europe that have been in a state of panic can now be temporarily comforted by hearing Hitler's words, because Hitler, in Germany's blood boiling and words激昂激昂, stated that Germany is ready to participate in peaceful discussions and is willing to live in peace with other countries in the world.</p>
<h3>France's Attitude Remains Unfavorable</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 24th French newspapers have not made favorable comments on British Prime Minister MacDonald's remarks in the House of Commons today. For example, the Paris Echo newspaper commented, "Inducing revenge is only enough to promote the tyranny of Hitler and Mussolini's dictatorship." The French are worried that they will now suddenly advance to the path of amending the treaty. The French believe that the timing of the treaty amendment is not yet ripe. As for Churchill's advocacy that diplomatic affairs should be carried out through diplomatic channels and opposition to MacDonald's continental negotiations, it has aroused great satisfaction in France.</p>
<h3>Hitler to Visit Rome</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, London, 24th It is learned that there will be new progress in German-Italian friendship. German Prime Minister Hitler has decided to fly to Rome in early April to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Also, the leader of the German Steel Helmet League has accepted the invitation of the Italian Prime Minister and will go to Rome on Pentecost.</p>
<h3>The Little Entente Has Other Views</h3>
<p>Guomin, Geneva, 24th The reorganized Little Entente, which is composed of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, has a total of 450,000 troops. Here, it is viewed as the most likely to hinder the success of the four-power peace agreement proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Many observers here believe that when the Romanian representative to the Disarmament Conference, Titulescu, advocated the immediate discussion of the British disarmament plan, his intention was to express the Little Entente's opposition, which seemed to be any treaty revision that would allow Germany, Italy, and Hungary to gain close understanding, and believed that if Mussolini's plan could be discussed at the same time as the disarmament proposal, the Romanian representative would take the opportunity to attack Mussolini's plan. Now, both plans show that Germany is restoring its equal status with the powers. France has always been known for supporting the reorganized Little Entente, and the Little Entente is afraid that Italy, Germany, and Hungary will become closer. Therefore, in order to protect themselves, they unite to deal with foreign countries. They know very well that Hungary will rearm, and the recent Hindenburg arms case will definitely increase their panic. They accuse Italy of secretly transporting 84,000 rifles and 200 machine guns, which were transported through Austria to Hungary. If this kind of action that violates the treaty cannot be satisfactorily explained as soon as possible, the Little Entente intends to petition the League of Nations. According to the observer's intention, the potential power of the Little Entente should not be underestimated, because the three countries not only agree to adopt a common foreign policy in Geneva, but also agree that they will never conclude a treaty with a foreign country without the consent of the other two countries. And Czech Foreign Minister Beneš's speeches at the League of Nations conferences are often respected by the public, and in the future, he will definitely make claims for the three countries. The original intention of establishing international organizations in Central Europe was to defend against the active trend of Italian-Hungarian foreign policy. They have always been afraid of amending the peace treaty, so they organize a consolidated organization so that they can cope with any common threats at any time. Italians call this the European Holy League, and the French view this as the peaceful foundation of the current European situation. The Czech Foreign Minister Beneš has made the greatest contribution to the establishment of the Little Entente. The Little Entente was previously worried that Romania would be politically seduced and allied with Italy, or allied with Germany for economic assistance, and then prevented Italy, Germany, and Hungary from forming an alliance. Therefore, for self-preservation, they united to deal with foreign countries. They know very well that Hungary will rearm, and the recent Hindenburg arms case will definitely increase their panic. They accuse Italy of secretly transporting 84,000 rifles and 200 machine guns, which were transported through Austria to Hungary. If this kind of action that violates the treaty cannot be satisfactorily explained as soon as possible, the Little Entente intends to petition the League of Nations. According to the observer's intention, the potential power of the Little Entente should not be underestimated, because the three countries not only agree to adopt a common foreign policy in Geneva, but also agree that they will never conclude a treaty with a foreign country without the consent of the other two countries. And Czech Foreign Minister Beneš's speeches at the League of Nations conferences are often respected by the public, and in the future, he will definitely make claims for the three countries.</p>
<h3>Redistribution of Colonies</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 23rd Although the British government strongly denies it, the Paris Echo newspaper today reprinted a message, saying that British Prime Minister MacDonald had discussed the redistribution of the colonies of the major powers with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome, and said that Mussolini had suggested that all the former German colonies in Africa should still belong to Germany, but MacDonald could not agree to this suggestion.</p>
<h3>Thirty Million People in the Slaughterhouse of the Northeast</h3>
<p>Reasons Why Puppet Officials Are Willing to Be Used</p>
<p>Nine of the Japanese Poisonous Schemes Have Been Implemented</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence, It has been more than eighteen months since the Northeast fell. What is the situation in the Northeast? Chinese people have no way of knowing. Even those who know it can only get fragmentary news from newspapers or people who come. I have been to the Northeast twice this year to conduct field investigations. Now I will list the main results of what I have obtained below for the reference of those who care about national affairs.</p>
<h3>Two Factions within the Government</h3>
<p>The puppet state of Manchukuo fabricated by the Japanese seems to be united on the surface. Who knows that there are also two paths inside. (A) The restoration faction. Puyi is indeed used by the Japanese to allow Manchus to govern the Manchukuo. How do you know that Puyi also intends to take advantage of the Japanese to realize his imperial dream, with Zheng Xiaoxu and others assisting him. Therefore, Zheng and others were eventually abandoned by Japan. (B) The Concord Association faction. Zhao Xinbo and others have a sincere love for Japan and are loyal to Manchukuo. They formed the Concord Association with the Japanese invaders to promote the essence of Manchukuo's founding and implement the virtues of the royal way, etc. Therefore, Japan has greatly rewarded the figures of this faction.</p>
<h3>Attitudes of Puppet Civil and Military Officials</h3>
<p>Why are civil officials in the puppet Manchukuo, such as provincial governors, hall directors, and county magistrates, and military officers, such as commanders and brigade commanders, willing to act as puppets of the puppet state? There are two reasons. (A) People who were unsuccessful before the September 18th Incident are very active and take advantage of the opportunity to achieve their goals. The Japanese use these people to appeal to the public. (B) Because their property is all in the Northeast, if they do not accept the Japanese commission, they will confiscate their property. Therefore, many officials do not hesitate to betray their conscience. In short, the reason why they are pro-Japanese is that they are greedy. As for other civil and military lower-level officials, they have no direct contact with Japan. Therefore, they do not feel any affection for Japan. They just go to work and report every day, and receive their salaries on time every month. In short, they are just trying to make a living and have no other role. When I asked, "You can make a living in the country, why be an official of the puppet state?" They replied, "Because we have gone to Beiping and other places to seek jobs and wait for appointments, but we have not succeeded in half a year. We heard about it, so we dare not go to the country to seek jobs." From this, we can see that the intentions of the general lower-level officials are by no means pro-Japanese.</p>
<h3>People Do Not Believe in the Puppet State</h3>
<p>The people of the Northeast do not believe in the puppet state. Therefore, the Japanese often fabricate public opinion, which is very different from the facts. Taking the suffering people of the Northeast as an example, although the Japanese use their pseudo-friendly means, such as lending spring plowing fees to farmers every spring plowing, or exempting miscellaneous donations, or feasting on village elders, etc., the general people have already seen through their bait and have learned from the precedents of the Koreans and will no longer be deceived by them.</p>
<h3>Various Cruelties of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The various cruelties suffered by the people of the Northeast at the hands of the Japanese army can be divided into four categories, as described below. (1) Under the guise of inspection, the Japanese army often interrogates pedestrians. If they see anything that is not satisfactory in their behavior, the Japanese army will accuse them of anti-Japanese crimes. Then, without asking whether it is true or not, they will immediately order them to dig their own graves. After digging, they will be buried alive in the pit. This is one of their cruelties. (2) Under the guise of cleanliness, the Japanese army arbitrarily goes to various shops, hotels, and residences to conduct major searches for anti-Japanese propaganda items or books such as the Three Principles of the People. If they do not find books but find the four words "Three Principles of the People," the Japanese army will create a literary inquisition. This is the second of their cruelties. (3) Under the guise of epidemic prevention, the Japanese army forcibly injects poisonous needles to the people in the cities and hotels between spring and summer. After the injection, the needle mark will immediately swell, become painful, and itchy, and it will take about a month to disappear. Their insidious intention can be seen. This is the third of their cruelties. (4) Under the guise of suppressing bandits, the Japanese army learns that there are bandits in a certain village, so they go to the village to suppress them severely. After driving them away, they will identify all the villagers who lived with the bandits as bandits, and they will kill all the villagers so that none of them can escape. Their cruel intentions can be seen. This is the fourth of their cruelties. The Japanese pirates have the above various cruel acts, so some families have committed suicide because they were forced to do so, and those who have moved to the country are transported by cars and ships, one after another. Those who have no moving expenses often sell their daughters to pay for the trip. This is common. The old and young are unable to escape and often freeze to death on the way. What the ancients called "nine out of ten houses empty" has now become "ten out of ten houses empty" in the Northeast. The cruel and beastly behavior of the Japanese army can be known.</p>
<h3>The Dissection of the Past and Future</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the various policies and sinister methods implemented by the Japanese have been truly shocking. A summary: (1) The establishment of the puppet Manchurian government, with its functions divided into three categories: (A) to deceive international observers; (B) to appease the people's minds. The organs are still held by Northeasterners, with the Japanese only placing one or two advisors, so that the general public feels that they are not being subjugated by Japan, and therefore cannot oppose the construction of the puppet state, in order to increase administrative efficiency. Since the Japanese are unfamiliar with the language and local conditions of our country, even if their policies are ingenious, they are not easily implemented. Therefore, they employ former local officials who were good at exploiting the people, and giants in the Northeastern political arena, to increase the efficiency of colonial administration. (2) The Financial Unification Committee, with its functions divided into three categories: First, to transform all banks in the Northeast into Japanese banks, and merge all banks in the Northeast into one Manchurian Central Bank, with 30 million Japanese yen as the foundation. Second, to confiscate the deposits of officials. The deposits of officials not serving the puppet state are confiscated under the name of rebellious funds. Third, to unify the currency system. Currently, only the puppet Manchurian Central Bank notes and gold notes are used in the Northeast. This is extremely convenient for the Japanese to manipulate. The price of silver notes and gold notes is consistent, which greatly facilitates the promotion of Japanese goods and the income of its directly controlled railways. (3) The Land Bureau, with its functions also divided into three categories: First, to confiscate the land of officials and wealthy families. Second, to reorganize the land tax system in the provinces, dividing it into business districts and residential districts, with extremely heavy taxes to be paid monthly (currently not implemented). Third, to investigate the number of acres of land in rural areas, and the soil quality, in preparation for future investment. (4) Economic blockade, with its functions divided into four categories: First, to suppress grain merchants. Second, rural loans are handled by the county. Third, the monopoly of local products, such as cotton yarn, cloth, and matches made by Northeasterners themselves, are sold to the Japanese at low prices, while the Japanese sell them at high prices. This is a monopoly policy. Fourth, Japanese goods are tax-free. (5) The Intelligence Agency, with a headquarters set up in the Provincial Police Department, and branches set up in various counties, specializing in reporting on those who scout for the Volunteer Army and those who promote anti-puppet state propaganda. Local agencies can arrest them at any time. Investigators are filled by village chiefs and local thugs. (6) The East Asia League. Employing disgruntled Northeastern military officers, ordering them to organize a large-scale army, and moving their families to Changchun, under Japanese surveillance, to prevent them from organizing volunteer armies. At the same time, they are also used to eliminate volunteer armies. Recruiting unemployed Northeastern youth, and enticing them with generous salaries, to prevent them from joining the volunteer army, and also using them to eliminate the volunteer army. Although the ambitions of Northeastern youth may not be like this, once they fall into the trap, the Japanese have their own clever methods of control. (7) Slave Education (A) Abolishing Writing. This year, the Ministry of Education of the puppet state has ordered teachers and students to use Japanese letters universally, as a way to eliminate Chinese. (B) Changing the Mind. The curriculum is specifically designed to cultivate students to be submissive, patient, humble, ignorant, muddled, numb, and decadent. (8) Double High-Pressure Policy. (A) The Japanese demonstrate in the areas of the Volunteer Army, and in newly occupied areas, searching villages one by one, firing machine guns as much as possible, so that the people know that resistance is certain death, and dare not resist. (B) Softening, by lending and forgiving land tax, sending Wang Dao propaganda members to give speeches in various places, deceiving the ignorant with promises of paradise, making them feel that national subjugation is also very good, so that they fundamentally do not think of resisting. (9) Dividing and Ruling, reducing provincial boundaries. It is planned to divide the Northeast into more than twenty counties, with the functions divided into two categories: (A) to increase the strength of rule; (B) to cut off the people's connection. Except for those who have received slave education, those who serve the puppet government, and those who do business, the rest cannot go from one province to another. Currently, the Northeast has already implemented Taobei, Taonan, Xingbei, etc. (10) The Chamber of Commerce Accountant, accumulating capital, planning to proceed, in order to monopolize the industry and commerce of the Northeast. (11) National Registration, the deed of sale of the people, the slave certificate. (12) Police Law, sending police to the countryside, workers executing their sacred public security law. At that time, the people will have no freedom of speech, action, or assembly. Human rights will be subject to police arbitrariness and autocratic politics. (13) Eliminating the Intellectual Class, in order to prevent the reaction and advocacy of intellectuals, after the establishment of national registration and the police, intellectuals will be arrested or expelled under the name of academic bandits. (14) Marriage Law, (A) Extinction of the race, by increasing the marriage tax, so that the poor have no ability to marry. (B) Weakening the race, for those who have the ability to marry, forcing them to marry early, so that their children are not strong. (15) Increasing Taxes. (16) Rural Investment. (17) The machine industry to defeat handicrafts. Above, 1 to 9 are already implemented, and 9 to 17 are planned to be implemented. In a few years, we will see our blood used to power their motorcycles, our heads used to build their towering Western-style buildings, and our children used as their serving cattle and horses. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? I deeply hope that those responsible in the party and the country will quickly rescue the 30 million people from the slaughterhouse.</p>
<h3>Wu Qiwai Recaptures Guangchang</h3>
<p>The puppet army retreated southwest of Ningdu</p>
<p>Ningdu and Lichuan will also be recovered</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch, Guangchang is located in the eastern corner of Gan East and Gan South. Zhu Mao's attack on Nanfeng failed, and after attacking Huangpi and suffering losses, they retreated and gathered at Qianshan, Xintian, and Kuzhu, in an attempt to defend Guangchang. The puppet 13th Army Corps in Yihuang south retreated to Jinzhu, Dongsao, and Luokou, blocking the National Army's advance to capture Ningdu. The puppet Independent 5th Division in Lean and other units were connected with the puppet 21st and 2nd Divisions on the east bank of the Gan River in Zhaoxie and Yongfeng, connecting Gan East and Gan West into one, as a retreat to enter Donggu, flee west across the Gan River, or escape south along the Gan River. Chen Cheng, the commander-in-chief of the Central Route Army of the National Army, in accordance with the military plan set by Chairman Chiang, since the 26th of last month, ordered the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Corps to advance from Lean, Yihuang, Nancheng, and Nanfeng to capture Lichuan, Guangchang, and Ningdu, echoing the Left Route Army of Min. This is because the 3rd Corps led by Cai Tingkai has advanced to the border of Tinglong, Ji, Ning, Tai, and Gan to suppress bandits. According to a telegram from the front line, the National Army's Li Mo'an and other units advanced extremely rapidly after capturing Huangpi and Dongpi. The gates of Guangning, such as Xintian and Kuzhu Luokou, have been recovered one after another. Wu Qiwai's troops directly approached Guangchang City on the 19th, defeating the bandit troops defending the city. That evening, they recovered Guangchang City. The main force of the puppet 135th Army Corps has retreated southwest from Ningdu Yongfeng. It is found that Guangchang has been ravaged by red bandits since the 17th year of the Republic of China, and there has been no peaceful day. When Chiang came to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression in the 20th year, it was recovered once. Later, Hu Zuyu, the commander of the former 5th Division, was shot and killed here, and Guangcheng fell into the hands of bandits again. It has been two years now, and now it sees the light of day again. When the National Army entered the city, what they saw was extremely miserable. They are now actively handling the aftermath. Only after Guangchang has been recovered, it can attack Jianning from the east in conjunction with the 口 army, and strike the famous bandit nest of 口口口口囗 from the west to take 口口. 口口 is north of Guangchang, so the connection between the bandits and Gan South has also been cut off, and recovery is no longer a problem. (March 20)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A Zhangze barge nearly capsizes</p>
<p>The barges sailing from Zhangze to Songjiang must pass through the Huangpu River. Yesterday afternoon, the wind suddenly became strong. A Lujia barge, fully loaded with passengers and goods, was sailing back. Unexpectedly, the hull was very heavy and the people were crowded. The hull suddenly tilted, and water poured into the boat. The passengers were immediately panicked. They immediately lowered the sail. Fortunately, it did not capsize. By the time it reached the town, it was already late. The passengers' clothes and shoes were soaked, and they returned in a state of disarray. However, it did not lead to disaster, which is already great luck.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Various industries jointly request postponement of filing tax returns</p>
<p>The county government's business tax bureau was ordered to forward orders to merchants in various industries, urging them to file business tax returns. Merchants in various industries argued that business was declining and there was no way to file. Magistrate Zou and Director Zhan specially convened representatives from various industries at the county chamber of commerce yesterday to earnestly advise them. More than 100 representatives from various industries attended. Under the chairmanship of Shi Junqing, Magistrate Zou and Director Zhan advised them. The representatives from various industries stated the difficulties in filing the returns. The talks lasted for two hours, but no solution was reached and they dispersed. On one hand, the 56 trade associations jointly submitted a report through the county chamber of commerce to the provincial government's finance department, requesting a postponement of the filing.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Department Thoroughly Investigates the Case Against the Public Security Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>Mao Naigong, the chief of the Wu County Public Security Bureau, was accused by Wang and Chen to the Department of Civil Affairs of illegal dereliction of duty, condoning gambling and opium dens, and exploiting the people. They requested his dismissal and investigation. After receiving the report, the Department of Civil Affairs ordered the Wu County Government to conduct a detailed investigation and report back, before further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>A farm woman struck and killed by lightning</p>
<p>For the past few days, the weather has been unusually cold, with torrential rain and thunderstorms. As of yesterday (the 24th), it was still overcast. There is a tendency to continue to fall. When the thunder rumbled a few days ago, a certain Mrs. Yang A'long, a villager from the 14th district, a mile or so away from Shizhuang Town, was 44 years old. She happened to be going to the town with two girls to exchange cotton thread. On the way, there were flashes of lightning, and a loud thunderclap. Mrs. Yang fell to the ground and was struck and killed by lightning. The scene was very tragic. Residents nearby heard the news and went to watch, reaching thousands of people. Now, her husband is preparing a coffin for her burial. Also, the house of Deng Erjia in Zhanggao Village in the 16th District was also destroyed by a huge lightning strike. A pillar of the newly built house, a box, and a wardrobe collapsed at the same time, and two walls collapsed. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Six families robbed in one night in Dingjialou</p>
<p>At about 9 o'clock the night before, a bandit boat suddenly arrived at the Mengzitan area of Dingjialou in the third district of the county. There were twenty or thirty bandits, carrying guns and weapons, who landed and committed robberies. They first went to Zhu Chuanfu's house, smashed the gate with a huge stone, and entered to search and rob. It is estimated that they lost a lot of ornaments, cotton clothes, and other items. Then they went to the houses of Zhou Zhen, Zhou Gu, Zhou Fusheng, Zhou Shuijin, Zhou Peisheng, and the Gao family to rob, losing the most in Zhou Fusheng's house.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Branch Discovers Extortion Case</h3>
<p>Tong Guozhang, an inspector of the county's Anti-Japanese Association, was detained for privately releasing enemy goods and accepting bribes. The case has not yet been concluded. Now, another extortion case has occurred at the branch inspection office of the Anti-Japanese Association in Meili. The local people are extremely angry. The situation is recorded as follows: The county Anti-Japanese Association, in order to facilitate the inspection of enemy goods, organized inspection branches in various towns. Meili Town in the east of the county is a prosperous commercial market, and a branch was also organized there. The inspectors were party members Lu and Cao. Unexpectedly, after the bribery case of the county Anti-Japanese Association was exposed, someone reported to the Supervisory Committee of the county Party Department that the Meili inspectors had extorted a fine of 40 yuan from Fengda Hongsheng and other stores. Supervisor Sun then sent prospective supervisor Huangfu Du to the countryside to investigate. After arriving in the countryside, he joined the police inspector Wang Yunxuan of the Public Security Bureau, and the supervisors of the third district Party Department, Shen Hong and Tong Shizhong, to Fengda Silk Store. They found the words "Paid 40 yuan to the Anti-Japanese Association, handled by Lu Shaozeng" on October 14 of last year in the silver dollar book. Then, they went to Hongsheng to investigate. The books of the store were being audited by the shareholders' meeting, so the manager of the store, Ma Jiliang, confirmed that this had happened. After signing the conversation transcript, Commissioner Huang returned to the city to report. Later, in order to clarify the truth, Commissioner Shi Minyong went to the countryside for a follow-up investigation. The local sentiment was indignant, and more than a thousand people gathered, demanding that Party Secretary Shi deal with the case severely, otherwise they would all strike to find out the truth. Then, Commissioner Shi took responsibility and decided to deal with the case severely, and the crowd dispersed.</p>

<h3>Central Government Sends Representatives to Shanghai</h3>
<h3>To Urge President Wang to Return to Nanjing and Resume His Duties</h3>
<p>Gu Mengyu Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>Sun Ke May Arrive This Morning</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Visited Wang Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Premier Wang Jingwei has insisted on resigning due to illness and came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to urge Acting Premier Song to officially take over. Mr. Song expressed his humility and visited Premier Wang yesterday morning to ask him to return to Nanjing and resume his duties. The Central Government has also appointed Committee Members Sun Ke and Gu Mengyu to come to Shanghai to urge him to return. Mr. Gu arrived in Shanghai last night and Mr. Sun is scheduled to arrive this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Song Visits Mr. Wang: After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Premier Wang visited Acting Premier Song to urge him to officially take over. Mr. Song expressed his inability to take on the position so as to focus on financial responsibilities. At 9:20 yesterday morning, Mr. Song specially visited Premier Wang on West Pubushilu to ask him to return to Nanjing to cancel his leave and resume his duties. Premier Wang insisted that he was not fully recovered from his illness and could not handle the heavy responsibilities, and firmly asked Acting Premier Song to officially take over. They talked until 10:10 before leaving, but neither side yielded and no agreement was reached.</p>
<p>Representatives Urge His Return: The Central Standing Committee decided the day before yesterday to appoint Committee Members Sun Ke and Gu Mengyu to come to Shanghai to urge Premier Wang to return to Nanjing and resume his duties immediately. Mr. Gu took the early express train to Shanghai yesterday morning and arrived at Zhenru Station at 5:35 pm. Premier Wang had been notified by Mr. Gu in advance by telegram and specially sent a car to Zhenru to greet him. After getting off the train, Mr. Gu immediately transferred to Premier Wang's car and drove directly to West Pubushilu to visit Mr. Wang and convey the Central Government's intention to urge Mr. Wang to return to Nanjing and resume his duties. As for Mr. Sun, because he had to attend a meeting of the Legislative Yuan yesterday morning, he took the night train from Nanjing last night and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 this morning, when he will visit Mr. Wang again to urge his return. Mr. Sun telegraphed Yu Ming, director of the External Affairs Office, the day before yesterday to represent Mr. Sun in visiting Mr. Wang yesterday afternoon to inquire about Mr. Wang's views on resuming his duties.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Talk: Mr. Wang replied in writing yesterday morning to questions from reporters, saying: (1) When asked by reporters about Vice Premier Song's visit this morning and what he would do if the Central Government insisted on asking Mr. Wang to resume his duties, Mr. Wang replied that yesterday, Zhaoming proposed to the Central Government on the one hand and urged Acting Premier Song to succeed him on the other hand. Acting Premier Song did not agree and still insisted on his previous statement during his visit. The Central Government has sent Mr. Sun Zhesheng and Mr. Gu Mengyu to Shanghai. We can probably meet tonight or tomorrow morning. I will discuss it in detail after the meeting. (2) It is rumored that Mr. Wang came here because a certain proposal of his was not approved by the Central Government. (Answer) There is no such thing. After Zhaoming arrived in Nanjing, he attended three meetings and made no proposals. How could there be a question of approval or disapproval? (3) It is also rumored that Mr. Wang still advocates punishing Zhang Xueliang, is that true? (Answer) There is no such intention either. Zhaoming's views are fully expressed in his speech at the Central Memorial Week on Monday this week. (4) There is a saying that Chairman Chiang sent a plane yesterday to invite Mr. Wang, I wonder when Mr. Wang has decided to meet him? (Answer) After Zhaoming arrived in Nanjing, he exchanged telegrams with Chairman Chiang and scheduled a meeting, but I cannot tell you the location and time at this time.</p>
<p>Gu Mengyu's Talk: Mr. Gu said to reporters from the Central News Agency in Zhenru yesterday that Premier Wang had requested at the Central Standing Committee the day before yesterday to officially confirm Vice Premier Song as Premier of the Executive Yuan, removing the word "Acting". The Central Standing Committee discussed this proposal. All the committee members advocated that Mr. Wang should be asked to resume his duties, and that the central government affairs urgently needed Mr. Wang to resume his duties as chairman. Therefore, President Sun and I were appointed to come to Shanghai to urge him. President Sun had to wait until tonight to take the night train from Nanjing due to some business, so I came to Shanghai first to visit Mr. Wang and convey the intention of the Central Government to urge Mr. Wang to return to Nanjing immediately to cancel his leave and resume his duties.</p>
<p>Tang Youren's Talk: Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and met with reporters from the Guowen News Agency. He said that Mr. Wang's visit was indeed due to illness. After Mr. Wang returned to Nanjing, he saw too many guests, which aggravated his weakness. There were no other reasons. Therefore, before Mr. Wang came, he asked the Central Government to resign from the government affairs on the one hand, and personally came to Shanghai to urge Minister Song to officially take over on the other hand. The military situation in North China has indeed been quite smooth recently. As for the rumors of establishing a neutral zone and a buffer zone, they were deliberately spread by someone to confuse foreign observers. In short, our country at this time absolutely cannot compromise, etc.</p>
<p>Support Association Telegram: Mr. Wang Jingwei, I have read your telegram and am pleased to know that you have returned to the country. With the fall of the Northeast, volunteer armies have risen up. Our colleagues have followed Mr. Zhu Qinglan in organizing the Liaojihei People's Support Association to call for assistance. Driven by conscience, we have fulfilled our responsibilities as commoners. However, our talents and abilities are meager and cannot help with the difficult situation. Now the strong enemy is penetrating deeper and the situation is becoming more critical. You, sir, are a mentor to the people and admired by the whole country. We still ask you to provide guidance so that we can follow it. We are extremely hopeful. We respectfully report and hope you will understand. The Liaojihei People's Support Association respectfully says hello,</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiqing's Three Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>I Will Not Return Unless the Northeast is Recovered</p>
<p>The Enemy Army is Defeated and Surrounded on All Sides</p>
<p>Li Cishan, the representative of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association who went to Peiping, sent three telegrams from Zhu Jiqing yesterday by express mail. One was addressed to Mr. Li himself, one was a draft telegram to be forwarded to Fu Zuoyi, and one was addressed to his office in Tianjin. All of them are extremely important. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Telling the Recent Situation</h3>
<p>To Mr. Li Cishan, I am pleased to hear that you have come to Tianjin. I have been out of the pass for half a year, and the country is getting worse every day. I am determined to die, but I cannot help with the difficult situation. It is useless to encourage me, and I feel deeply guilty. I am extremely grateful for your distant condolences. I can only encourage the army to live up to your expectations. I am grateful for all the help you have given me in the past, and I am grateful for your inquiry about our current needs, which shows your concern. I respectfully report to you, sir, the determination, environment, and plan of our army. Our army is organized to fight for the survival of the nation, and we must fight for the survival of the nation. The danger of the environment and the inadequacy of the rear are not considered by our army. The only reason is that the people here are willing to live and die with our army. Not only can we not leave, but we also cannot bear to leave. Currently, we have no other needs. However, since the retreat of the National Army to the rear, the leaders of the volunteer armies have also left with them. Their troops have no place to rely on and have come to join us. The number of people is increasing day by day, and the expenses are increasing greatly. Ammunition is now impossible to transport, 口口口口 can barely fight, but the economy has reached the point of exhaustion. I hope you, sir, can teach us. In addition, our army established a basic unit in northern Hebei. Although transportation is cut off, we cannot bring it here. We have also joined the Xifengkou and are cooperating with the National Army to fight. I hope you, sir, will give us full spiritual and material assistance, and do your best to support the new anti-Japanese forces in that unit. Even if we are unfortunate here, our anti-Japanese work will not be interrupted. Then we will be greatly blessed. Currently, we have decided to advance to 口口 after the 口口口口 thaws. If the National Army launches a counterattack at the same time, we can achieve a pincer effect. I respectfully express my wishes and express my gratitude. I hope you will understand, Zhu Jiqing respectfully says.</p>
<h3>Expressing Determination</h3>
<p>Translated and forwarded to Chairman Fu Yisheng, I have long admired your reputation and long to see you. Comrade Meng Wenbo returned to Peiping from Zhangyuan and telegraphed to tell me about your kind attention. I am very grateful. Qing is too old to do anything, but because the violent Japanese are bullying us too much, I believe that every commoner has a responsibility to save the country and dare not lag behind others. Since leaving the pass last year, I have advocated the volunteer army, attacking Yixian and attacking Jinzhou. I have fought dozens of battles before and after, determined to fight this old life to the end with the violent Japanese. However, some Chinese people have blindly added jealousy and obstructed us. The national crisis is serious, but the hearts of the people are like this, which is very sad. Qing is determined that he will not return unless the Northeast is recovered. Now he is surrounded by enemies on all sides, transportation is cut off, and supplies are cut off. When the armies retreated before, he could not follow them south, but he had no face to see the elders in the pass, so he decided not to retreat. Now he is reorganizing the volunteer armies and will fight a desperate battle with the violent Japanese. Success or failure is not taken into account. General, you are wise and promising, and the world admires you. The great cause of saving the country depends on your efforts. I respectfully express my gratitude and wish you victory. Zhu Jiqing respectfully says.</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Instructions</h3>
<p>He also telegraphed to his office in Nanjing, saying: (1) Omitted. (2) Regiment Commanders Chen Lianfu and Li Dianlin have gone to 口口口口 to cooperate with the 口 army. It is in line with the machine and is commendable. Zhang Qinghe, Zhu Guosheng, Liu Junqing, and others who were recruited should also be concentrated and sent to the war as soon as possible. The rear is in economic difficulty. You can first raise clothing and supplies, and if the guns and cannons are not enough, you can contact Song Mingxuan or ask the Military Branch Committee, the Liaojihei People's Support Association, or the Shanghai Volunteer Army Support Association. (3) Tell Chen and Li and forward to the armies that they should use a roundabout strategy, and victory will be achieved. If the enemy fails, they will rise up everywhere. You must not fight in the style of Zhang, Qing.</p>
<h3>Ge Song's Two Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Request for Assistance: Song Zheyuan's army is annihilating the enemy at Xifengkou and is invincible. However, because the enemy has repeatedly increased reinforcements and our army is having material difficulties, Ge Dingyuan, the secretary-general of the army's headquarters, has telegraphed to Qu Wenliu to find a way to provide assistance. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Longji, please translate and send it to Mr. Qu Wenliu. Commander-in-Chief Mingxuan annihilated the enemy at Xifengkou, and the whole country is happy. However, the enemy is increasing endlessly, and our army is having material difficulties. People from all sides are donating generously, which proves that the hearts of the people are not dead. You, sir, and Mingxuan have long had a public and private friendship, and you should give them assistance. Please raise your voice and advocate for the Southeast. I am going to the Zunhua front line this afternoon, and I also heard, Ge Dingyuan respectfully says,"</p>
<p>Welcoming Treatment: Representative Sun Longji, I have received your telegram. The Shanghai Chinese Relief Association plans to send personnel to the north to set up hospitals to treat and relieve wounded soldiers. They are concerned about the wounded and disabled, and are extremely admirable. If you come to Hebei, please contact Director Xie in Jixian. Please pass on my thanks, Song Zheyuan says.</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Donating Steel Helmets to Song and Sun's Armies</h3>
<p>One thousand three hundred helmets</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce believed that Song Zheyuan and Sun Dianying's armies fought bravely against the Japanese, fought fiercely on the Great Wall, and repeatedly defeated the enemy's vanguard. Their achievements were great. They had previously sent a telegram to express their condolences. Yesterday, they specially put 1,300 steel helmets that had been collected into the consolation box and sent it to Peiping, entrusting the Peiping City Chamber of Commerce to distribute it equally to Song and Sun's armies to encourage morale.</p>
<p>Wang Delin, etc.</p>
<h3>Families Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The families of 158 generals of the Jilin Province Volunteer Army General Commander Wang Delin's troops left Qingdao on the Zhaoshangju's Wuyang ship the day before yesterday. It is estimated that they will arrive in Shanghai at noon today and berth at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund. All food and lodging problems have been properly contacted by Wang Delin's representative in Shanghai, Zhang Chuyu, with various organizations.</p>
<h3>Yutong Steamer Report</h3>
<p>Ran aground on a reef in the 儧伦 waters yesterday</p>
<p>The company has sent a Japanese rescue ship to help</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Yutong ship of the Yuda Steamer Company at No. 14, Lao Yongan Street in this city, which specializes in sailing to Dalian and Yingkou, suddenly received a radio report yesterday morning that the ship had run aground on a reef near 儧伦 and was requesting assistance. The reporter inquired at the company in the afternoon and learned the following:</p>
<h3>From Dalian to Fujian</h3>
<p>The head office of Yuda Steamer Company is in Yingkou, and there is a branch office in Shanghai that handles loading matters. The company has a total of three commercial ships, Yuda, Yuji, and Yutong. The Yutong ship has the least tonnage, with a tonnage of 920 tons. The shipowner is a Japanese named Sanjin Longxiong. There are more than 30 crew members. Last winter, because the Yingkou River was frozen, the ship changed its route between Dalian and Xinghua. This time, it was carrying miscellaneous grains, bean cakes, and other goods from Dalian. There were no passengers on board and it was transporting them to Xinghua, Fujian for delivery.</p>
<h3>Aground</h3>
<p>The ship set sail from Dalian on the 21st of this month, heading south. Yesterday around 7:00 AM, it arrived near Xinghua in Fujian Province and ran aground due to fog obscuring the navigation route. The accident occurred at 119.10 degrees east longitude and 25.23 degrees north latitude, at a place called Qixing Reef inside Gaobei Mountain. After running aground, a telegram was immediately sent to the company's management office in this port. The company received the news and immediately organized a rescue effort. However, the first to receive the news in this port was the Shanghai Coastal Radio Station, which received a relayed distress telegram from the American ship "President Taft" at 8:30 AM yesterday morning, reporting the name of the ship in distress and its latitude and longitude. After receiving the telegram, the radio station immediately reported it to the customs and the company.</p>
<h3>Telegram Reporting Distress</h3>
<p>The company first received a telegram from the ship around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, reporting that it had run aground due to fog. At 11:00 AM, a second report was received, stating that the front of the ship was tilting, water was entering the hull, and the situation was very dangerous, requesting the hire of a Japanese rescue ship for assistance. The third telegram was sent by the company's branch office in Fujian, reporting the previous situation. No mention was made of any casualties among the crew.</p>
<h3>Attempts to Provide Assistance</h3>
<p>After receiving the telegram, the company, on the one hand, consulted with a Japanese rescue ship to arrange for assistance, and on the other hand, requested the Shanghai Shipping Association to ask the Coastal Patrol Office to request the Navy Department to order nearby warships to provide assistance. The rescue ship has already set sail.</p>
<h3>Insurance Amount</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Dong Disheng, an employee of the company, speaking to reporters yesterday, the insured amount for the ship is 120,000 taels, insured by the United Insurance Marine Insurance Company. After receiving the news, the company sent the three telegrams it received to the United Insurance Company, requesting compensation according to the amount insured.</p>
<p>Various Circles</p>
<h3>### Aviation to Save the Nation Movement</h3>
<h3>### City Recruits Heavy Army</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that the Shanghai City Council of the Boy Scouts of China has appointed Mr. Tong Xingbai, the executive director of the council, as the chief captain and the head of each troop as the captain to recruit airplanes named "Shanghai Boy Scouts". They will conduct this activity separately. At 8:00 PM the night before last, Mr. Tong specially invited the captains to the ninth floor of the YMCA to discuss the plan and decided on the starting date. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>More Than Sixty Troop Leaders Attended</h3>
<p>Those who were invited to attend the night before last included the troop leaders of the following Boy Scout troops: Daxia, Guanghua, Fudan, Liangjiang, Dongya, China, Moore Hall, City Chamber of Commerce, Fifty Troops, Southeast, Qingxin Xiangsheng, Jiangnan, Shangxiao, Shizhong, Silk Workers, Yucai, Ningyi, Post Workers, Yousheng, Wuyu, Meixi, He'an, YMCA, Jinrong, Junyi, Rotary Club, Lisheng, Minli, Datong, etc., as well as all the directors of the council and the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Pan Gongzhan, and over sixty other people.</p>
<h3>Tong's Report on Five Measures</h3>
<p>During the meeting, Chairman Tong Xingbai stood up and reported, saying, "It is a rare opportunity to gather here with all of you tonight. I think everyone knows that various industries are now donating airplanes separately, but the first one was actually our Boy Scouts. At that time, we once promoted fundraising, but later, to avoid falling behind others, regarding the fundraising method, I have discussed five methods with the Aviation Association, and the principles have all been agreed to, including: (1) All donations raised by the Boy Scouts will be handed over to the Aviation Association for safekeeping and used exclusively for purchasing the 'Boy Scouts' airplane. (2) The publicity materials, badges, receipts, etc. required for fundraising will be provided by Troop 107. (Mr. Tong is also the captain of that troop.) All proceeds from Troop 107 will be added to the 'Boy Scouts' Fund. (3) The fundraising efforts of the Boy Scouts will also be counted as Troop 107's achievements. (4) After the funds are deposited with the Aviation Association, the council may appoint one person to participate in the fund management committee. (5) The fundraising expenses will be borne by the council, and the prizes will be provided by the Aviation Association."</p>
<h3>Fundraising Starts Next Monday</h3>
<p>The goal of this fundraising is set at 25,000 silver dollars, which will be used to purchase a training aircraft. The fundraising teams are divided into two types, A and B. Troops with 60 or more members are Type A, and those with fewer are Type B. The standard for Type A is 1,000 dollars, and for Type B it is 500 dollars. Fundraising should be done through self-donation and with relatives and friends, avoiding street solicitation. The date is set from the 27th of this month to the 26th of April. Each troop will report their achievements every ten days. The amount of self-donation is also stipulated: (1) Boy Scouts must donate at least 30 cents (silver dollars), (2) Service personnel must donate at least two dollars, and (3) Troops must donate at least ten dollars. Prizes are also divided into three types: Type A troops, Type B troops, and individuals, mainly consisting of silver shields, banners, silver cups, medals, etc.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association Team Leaders</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai Solicitation Team of the Chinese Aviation Association on the first of this month, the achievements have been remarkably excellent in just over twenty days because the team leaders in charge of solicitation are all leaders from various circles. The Central News Agency reporter has learned the full list of teams and their leaders' titles from the headquarters of the Solicitation Team, which are disclosed below: Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Lu Wenshao, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Wenqi, Bei Songsun, Chen Zheqing, Zheng Zenan, Ma Shaoquan, Pan Xusheng, Yu Zuoting, Chen Yizhou, Ma Jiliang, Wen Lanting, Lao Jingxiu, Chen Songyuan, Jiang Zhigang, Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, Pei Yunqing, Ye Jiaxing, Zheng Hongnian, Weng Zhilong, Li Denghui, Cao Hui, Ou Yuanhuai, Yan Fuqing, Wu Jingxiong, Zhang Zhongdao, Huang Boqiao, He Shizhen, Zhang Shouyong, Chu Huiqiao, Chu Minyi, Shen Qingsheng, Guo Minchou, Rong Bao, Huang Naishu, Tang Baoshu, Tang Haian, Song Ziliang, Huang Huannan, Shen Kunshan, Zhang Xiaolin, Hu Mengjia, Li Fuxun, Qian Xinzhi, Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Gongquan, Yu Qiaqing, Rong Zongjing, Yao Mulian, Guo Shun, Liu Hongsheng, Qin Runqing, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Xiaoliang, Liu Zhansi, Zhu Xuefan, Dai Ji, Xu Shiying, Lu Jingshi, Huang Jinrong, Chen Guangfu, Wang Yiting, Jiang Yiping, Wang Yunwu, Lufei Bohong, Shen Tianbing, Lu Bohong, Jin Tingsun, Hu Junzhuang, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Qinfu, Huang Renzhi, Wu Zhihao, Zhao Jinqing, Zhang Zhuping, Guo Chengen, Mu Ouchu, Nie Lusheng, Wei Tingrong, Gu Xinyi, Tao Guilin, Xu Xinliu, Wu Shan, Chen Liting, Hu Bijang, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Jian'an, Ding Shujing, Wang Liming, Wang Boqun, Zhang Shichuan, Shao Zuiweng, Bu Wancang, Zheng Tonghe, Wang Boqi, Shen Junsheng, Dong XianGuang, Huang ZaoXiong, Tao Baichuan, Tong Xingbai, Guo Le, Zhou Feicheng, Wang Xiaoying, Chen Heqin, Wei Pengdan, Wu Liande, Ma Shaochen, Xu Jiying, Zhang Zilian, Qian Jinhua, Zhang Xingbai, Wang Fuqing, Zhu Jingan, Cheng Daoqing, Zhang Yunsheng, Wang Bao, Li Shengbo, Qiu Zhongcheng, Cai Shengbai, Wang Weiqing, Huang Jinfan, Tu Youqin, Lu Qinglai, Cao Jinke, Zhang Jingquan, Wang Lide, Chen Liangyu, Wang Zixuan, Chen Yucheng, Mo Jinqing, Song Zhengjin, Tang Yeqin, Sun Rongchang, Chen Zhongyan, Fan Youlan, Gong Jichang, Shen Jiucheng, Yan Yukun, Zhu Xianfang, Jiang Keting, Wang Lianfang, Li Dixian, Yang Xingdi, Xu Yangnan, Wang Yuqing, Jiang Lanting, Jian Yujie, Xi Guansheng, Pu Shuhong, Shao Gaoxiang, Chen Xuyuan, Dong Xingfu, Pang Zanchen, Qiao Yuting, Zhang Xianmei, Wu Qingtai, Huang Shoumin, Zhou Huanzhang, Luo Haitao, Gong Jingyan, Cai Runsheng, Chen Zengguan, Zhou Jukang, Zhang Dalian, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Hanliang, Lin Gengsheng, Shen Huachen, Wu Yinhuai, Shen Xiaopin, Wang Rongchang, Zhang Yichen, Wang Quanxing, Wang Rongqing, Wei Hongwen, Zhang Xizhai, Lu Zhengbing, Fei Tinghua, Ying Xiansan, Wu Qinshi, Rong Qianchu, Lu Xiaozuo, Wang Lianfang, Liu Minzhai, Li Mulian, Mao Jicheng, Gu Youjun, Zheng Hairuo, Hu Juewen, Yu Yiting, Yu Hongjun, Yang Hu, Wu Xingya, Wen Hongen, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Yi, Xu Peihuang, Jin Liren, Cai Zengji, Li Tingan, Wang Ruiquan, Shi Zhikun, Zhu Zixiang, Zhu Binglu, Zhu Kejun, Wu Zisheng, Wu Qiding, Shen Qinglin, Wang Yinting, Rui Qingrong, Yu Chenwu, Fan Songsheng, Ke Juchu, Tang Shoumin, Xu Busun, Xu Shidan, Tang Zhengfu, Zhang Zhisheng, Zhang Jitang, Zhang Fengyan, Zhang Xianda, Xu Guanqun, Lu Fengzhu, Chen Longqing, Chen Yongnian, Yang Jingshi, Chen Ziyi, Chen Zixin, Chen Dayu, Chen Chengde, Chen Shide, Chen Duomin, Fu ZaiGao, Cheng Kefan, Cheng Youfu, Cheng Yujie, Fu Zuoheng, Yu Zhonghuang, Xiang Shengwu, Huang Yueyuan, Huang Yougen, Huang Yuming, Ye Zhushan, Ge Weian, Ge Shengru, Ge Jieya, Li Shuxiong, Zheng Shiming, Zheng Jiuyuan, Lai Zhenhuan, Zou Yuqing, Xie Baosheng, Tan Juru, Wei Shanfu, Gu Zhenmin, Gu Jisheng, Gu Jiatang, Wen Jiangang, Xie Qi, Yan Shenyu, Zhu Tingqi, Gu Jiuru, Cha Meinan, Jian Lingfu.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng's Encouragement</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the chief captain of the Aviation Association, sent letters to each team leader, including Wang Yansong, yesterday, saying, "Your team's performance in the first solicitation report is excellent. It shows your enthusiasm for patriotism and your eagerness to solicit donations. I am deeply impressed. However, any great achievement has a difficult beginning and a huge conclusion. Now that the entire task is not yet completed, it is still a time for continuous effort. With your understanding of the principles and courage to take responsibility, I believe you will continue to move forward to complete the task."</p>
<h3>Ye Jiaxing Pays Donation</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce initiated the fundraising for the "Shanghai Merchant No. 1" airplane, through the efforts of the executive committee members, the results have been quite good. Chen Duesheng and Fu Yizhou, two executive committee members, have already paid the donations they pledged to the association. It is now learned that Ye Jiaxing, an executive committee member, also paid a donation of 5,000 dollars to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday for verification. According to Mr. Ye, the Japanese invaders have occupied the Great Wall, and unless the air force is strengthened, it is not enough to talk about resisting the enemy. Merchants should understand their responsibility for the rise and fall of the country. Donating money will allow the "Shanghai Merchant" airplane to be completed as soon as possible, which can increase the strength to resist Japan.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Concession Factories</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Decides on Negotiation Principles</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the implementation of factory inspections, due to the opposition of the concession authorities, the municipal government has negotiated repeatedly without results. It is now learned that the municipal government is currently planning a proper negotiation principle to ensure that the factories in the concessions are inspected as soon as possible. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>General Principles: Factory inspections are extremely important for factory safety. The Ministry of Industry, in view of this, has repeatedly requested the municipal government to implement them as soon as possible and has sent Mr. Li Pingheng, the director of the Labor Department of the ministry, to Shanghai to cooperate with the municipal government and relevant agencies to supervise the implementation. The municipal area has already been completed, but the public concession and the French concession have been delayed due to the opposition of the respective concession authorities. Recently, the municipal government has repeatedly sent representatives to hold informal meetings with the concession authorities, but there has been no progress. Therefore, Mr. Yu Hongjun, the secretary-general of the municipal government, and others are now planning a proper negotiation principle to be submitted to the central government for decision before proceeding accordingly. The general principles can be divided into two: (1) If negotiations fail, take strong measures; (2) Consult with the concession authorities on a proper solution. However, judging from the current situation, it is more appropriate to take the second option in the future.</p>
<p>Concession Attitude: The Shanghai Municipal Council of the public concession initially did not have a firm opposition to our implementation of factory inspections in the concession. However, because the factories opened by Westerners in the concession were deeply concerned that after our implementation of factory inspections, in order to ensure the safety of the factories, it would be necessary to correct them, which would be unfavorable to the factory owners, they strongly opposed it. Imperceptibly, the attitude of the municipal council has increased its opposition. In order to avoid our inspection, it will propose to amend Article 34 of the annex to the Yangjingbang Regulations at the Western Ratepayers' Meeting on April 19, so that the municipal council has the power to inspect factories itself and prevent our inspection. This matter is extremely important to our national sovereignty, so it will inevitably lead to negotiations. Moreover, Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Regulations stipulates that after the Yangjingbang is revised, it must be formally approved by the diplomatic corps and agreed to by our government before it can take effect. Regarding this point, we must have a deep understanding.</p>
<p>Establishing an Association: Since the Tai Rubber Factory and the Yonghe Industrial Company's rubber department successively experienced tragic accidents of exploding cylinders, resulting in the death and injury of many workers, the Shanghai Chinese Factory Inspection Association, in view of the need to protect the safety of workers, is preparing to establish an Industrial Welfare Association to assist the progress of factory inspections. All preparatory matters for the association are being carried out separately by Mr. Tian Heqing and others from the factory inspection section of the municipal social bureau.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks</p>
<h3>Vigorously Absorbing Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Shanghai Daily, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the abolition of taels and the conversion to silver dollars, the tendency of foreign banks to absorb silver dollars has become increasingly obvious. The amount of silver dollar exports to the United States reached 1,500 bars by the 19th. Currently, the absorption of silver dollars by American bankers such as the Mecca Bank and Citibank is still unabated, so that the silver dollars in stock in Chinese banks are gradually shifting to foreign banks, and the silver in stock in Shanghai is also showing a gradual decline. As of the 23rd, the current silver in stock is 153,189,000 taels of standard silver and 258,990,000 dollars of silver dollars, that is, silver dollars increased to 2,600,000 dollars, and standard silver decreased to 261,000 taels.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Silver Ingots Transported to Hankou</h3>
<p>For the Purchase of Tea</p>
<p>During this week, a large amount of silver dollars (all silver ingots) were transported from this city to Hankou, about 400 boxes, weighing about 1.2 million taels. Most of them were transported by foreign banks. Yesterday, there were another 195 boxes of silver ingots, including 155 boxes weighing 500,000 taels, which were transported by the British HSBC Bank, and the rest were transported by Chinese banks. All were loaded on British ships and exported to Hankou this morning. It is said that the silver is for the purchase of tea.</p>
<p>China General Chamber of Industry</p>
<h3>Advocating Government Control of the Economy</h3>
<p>Inviting Various Groups to Discuss Suggestions Today</p>
<p>The China General Chamber of Industry believes that the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent and that there is a lack of focus in dealing with foreign affairs. It advocates suggesting to the central government to change the current government's position to a wartime organization and implement a controlled economy to concentrate the strength of the country to cope with the current crisis and fight a long-term war. It has drafted several concrete plans and decided to invite the city party headquarters, the city chamber of commerce, the general labor union, the daily newspaper association, the reporter association, and other groups to jointly discuss the major policy of saving the country at the Bank Club at No. 4 Hong Kong Road at 6:00 PM today to make strong suggestions to the central government.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC)</p>
<h3>This Year's Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Deficit of 1.42 Million Taels</p>
<p>Difficult to Extend Restoration of Two Li General Tax</p>
<p>At a meeting on March 17, the Finance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Director of Finance presented the revenue results of the previous year and the estimates for this year, and statistically analyzed the expenditures required for each part. The recurring expenses for this year are approximately 16,475,000 taels, and the recurring expenses for education are 1,623,000 taels, for a total of 18,100,000 taels.</p>
<p>The recurring revenue, excluding the 50,000 taels to make up for the deficit of the previous year, is estimated to be 16,670,000 taels, which is approximately 1,420,000 taels less than the expenditures. This amount is approximately equal to the collection of three seasons of the two-li municipal tax.</p>
<p>In order to balance the budget and in view of the current economic downturn and the fact that this port has not fully recovered from the war last year, efforts are still being made to avoid restoring the municipal tax to 1.6 li. However, this is an unavoidable measure in view of the current situation, and the increase in tax will eventually be difficult to sustain. In the past five years, the Shanghai Municipal Council was able to cope with the situation because of the proceeds from the sale of the Electricity Department. Therefore, the plan for this year is to base it on this special revenue and transfer 1,100,000 taels from the reserve fund to recurring revenue. In this way, the municipal tax for 1933 can be exempted from increase and still be collected at 1.4 li.</p>
<p>However, municipal expenses are increasing year by year. Although the heads of the various departments are making efforts to tighten up, if the revenue does not increase, all plans related to public interests will be difficult to implement. Even the work of the Health Department is increasing day by day, and according to the existing education policy, education expenses are also gradually increasing. Therefore, the Director of Finance believes that all large-scale construction projects that require large amounts of money and cannot be completed at once should be implemented with extreme caution.</p>
<p>The expenditure on the temporary part of this year is approximately 29,920,000 taels, including 1,316,600 taels for the deficit of the previous year, but excluding 526,150 taels for temporary education expenses. The revenue items, excluding education expenses, total 29,960,000 taels, of which approximately 6.5 million taels need to be raised through public bonds. Comparing the revenue and expenditure in this way, there is still approximately 40,000 taels remaining in the temporary item.</p>
<p>Qu Yingguang</p>
<h3>Going to War Zone Today for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Qu Yingguang of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation for Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a telegram from Ge Dingyuan, Secretary-General of the Fifth Army Corps, saying, "Brother Sun Longji and Brother He Kezhi, please translate and forward to Mr. Qu Wenliu. The previous telegram has been received. Yesterday, I came to Zunhua and learned that various charitable organizations in Shanghai have sent you north for disaster relief. I deeply admire your enthusiasm for saving the people, regardless of the hard work of traveling. I am very willing to hear your instructions. Please send a telegram to indicate your travel date." Mr. Qu specially replied to the telegram yesterday, saying, "Secretary-General Ge Zhuochao of the Zunhua Fifth Army Corps Headquarters: I received the telegram from Ma Yang at the same time. I have been appointed by various charitable organizations to go to the war zone for disaster relief and will take the express train north on the morning of the 25th. Please investigate and draft in advance the situation of the disaster in the war zone and how to provide relief. I will contact you in Ping. Please comfort Brother Mingxuan. Yingguang respectfully."</p>
<p>Various Circles in California</p>
<h3>Initiating North China Refugee Relief Association</h3>
<p>Enthusiastically Participating in Organization</p>
<p>Holding Lectures and Fundraising</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invaded Manchuria, countless Chinese people have lost their homes and provinces, and old, young, women, and children have been brutally murdered. Those who have been displaced and have no clothes or food have reached hundreds of thousands. The situation is tragic and has been broadcast to the world.

<p>Public Works Department</p>
<h3>Continued Records of Candidates' Political Views for Council Seats</h3>
<p>Yesterday, three more candidates for seats on the Public Works Department council of the International Settlement expressed their political views as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Massey said, "My main principles for municipal administration are economy, efficiency, and safety. This is my first time running, so I do not intend to express specific political views. If elected, I will dedicate myself to the welfare of the citizens, true cooperation with neighboring areas, and the preservation of the rights and privileges of the foreign residents of Shanghai."</p>
<p>Mr. Franklin said, "The current political status of the Public Works Department must be maintained until the Chinese and foreign citizens can obtain the same guarantees of safety as they have enjoyed in the past. To maintain this safety, I advocate that the police force, volunteer corps, and fire brigade should be given the greatest possible effectiveness and the necessary strength in their work, and they should cooperate closely with the foreign naval and land forces stationed in Shanghai. Attention should also be paid to the health of the citizens and the construction of public works, such as widening roads and providing parks. The issue of road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement should also be resolved as soon as possible. The authorities of the Public Works Department and the neighboring authorities should especially strive to cooperate."</p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald said, "In principle, I agree with the policies implemented by the Public Works Department last year. I hope that my many years of experience in Shanghai will enable me to serve the citizens to the best of my ability."</p>
<h3>Appeal of Dismissed Employees of Two Railways</h3>
<p>According to sources from the dismissed employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways yesterday, Huang Boqiao, the director of the two railways, has dismissed 57 staff members. According to the usual practice of downsizing in various institutions, those who have nothing to do or lack ability are usually dismissed. However, those dismissed by Huang this time were all those who had been assigned work during the Shanghai Battle and had made contributions, and who were diligent and conscientious in their daily work. Therefore, they were very dissatisfied with Huang's dismissal method. However, Huang has newly hired more than 50 people, and the actual number and salary expenditure are greater than that of the dismissed employees. All the dismissed employees were indignant. However, according to the usual practice of the bureau, each staff member has a pension savings, and they were afraid that Huang would deduct and withhold it. They endured for more than a month and were inconvenient to speak out. Until a few days ago, each staff member received the savings, so they hired lawyer Chao Kun to file a complaint according to law, and at the same time, they joined forces to reason with Huang and put forward three reasons for questioning: (1) Reinstate the dismissed staff members according to law; (2) If the old employees cannot be reinstated, new employees should not be hired, in order to conform to the actual savings; (3) If it is necessary, the best of the dismissed staff members should be selected and appointed first. If it is said that the dismissed personnel have committed fraud or dereliction of duty, the facts should be clearly announced to show fairness. After receiving this question, Huang urgently telegraphed the chief of the accounting office, Haili, to reply that the savings of the dismissed staff members have been received, and are currently under negotiation (a long telegram has been omitted).</p>
<h3>Preparations for Tea Improvement Field</h3>
<p>Regulations Approved by the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Site is Located in Ningzhou, Jiangxi</p>
<p>The Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus, considering that tea has always been a major export commodity of our country, and in recent years, it has been affected by the competition from Indian, Sri Lankan, and Japanese tea, resulting in a great decline in foreign trade. The strategy to save it, in addition to strictly implementing inspection to improve the credibility of Chinese tea in the international market, should actively improve the quality and make fierce competition with the newly emerging tea-producing countries. Therefore, the three institutions directly under the Ministry of Industry jointly established a tea improvement field, named the Joint Tea Improvement Field. The site is located in Baixiankeng, Xiushui, Jiangxi (formerly Ningzhou), the old site of the Ning Tea Planting Company. It is found that the company was founded by Cantonese merchant Chen Yizhou and others, and has a history of more than ten years, with an investment of more than 200,000 yuan, and the scale is quite large. It has more than 1,500 mu of tea plantations, and all tea-making machinery and equipment are very complete. Now the company is willing to supply all the tea plantations, field bases, and tea-making machinery and equipment for the field to use for experiments and improvements. All matters have been negotiated and settled. All the regulations of the field have also been approved by the Ministry of Industry, and Yu Haiqing, a technician of the tea inspection class of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, has been appointed by the Experiment Station as the director of the preparatory office of the field.

<h3>Yang Jingfang to be Extradited to Chuansha for Trial</h3>
<p>Involved in More Than Thirty Cases</p>
<p>Yang Jingfang (also known as Yang Wei, also known as Little Yang), a native of Chuansha, opened the Continental Construction Factory at No. 47 Ningbo Road, and had his own No. 8690 car, which was quite luxurious. On the afternoon of October 12th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, Yang, together with the arrested Huang Juechu, Jiang Yingen, Wang Guocai, Lin A’kui, and others, kidnapped Cai Guisong, a wealthy household in Caijia Road, for ransom. After Cai was ransomed, he died within a year. Later, Xu Pucheng, the chief of the first district of the Water Police Team, learned that Yang Jingfang, the principal offender in the case, was hiding, so he, together with Lu Liankui, the chief detective of the General Patrol Room, Shen Tianbao, Zhou Honglin, and others, arrested Yang on the 18th of the previous month, and seized a pistol and six bullets from Yang's side, and brought him back to the patrol room to be sent to the first criminal court of the First Special Court. He was then taken back by the Songhu Garrison Command for interrogation. Yang has now been transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying, together with Prosecutor Ouyang Shu, held a court hearing. According to Yang Jingfang's confession, he is 38 years old, a native of Chuansha, opened the Continental Construction Factory, and served as a councilor of the Water Police Administration of the Ministry of Finance, a councilor of the Independent Brigade of the 88th Division, and an inspector of the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office. He has always denied the kidnapping behavior, and said that he was falsely accused. Then, the Chuansha County Government sent the Director of Public Security to the court to state that Yang had kidnapped people for ransom and shot women in Chuansha County, committing more than 30 cases. Now, the families of the victims have filed complaints with the county government, so they have specially prepared a document to ask the court to take him back for trial.

Upon his release in January of this year, his wife was indeed missing, which further fueled his suspicions. He eagerly sought revenge and, between January 4th and 15th, sent three threatening letters to Bo Laoke, a Western employee of the tram company, and Wang Afu, the General Manager, demanding 100,000 yuan. He then reported to the Lao Zha Station, falsely accusing He Shengxiang of writing the letters. The station ordered detectives to arrest He. At this time, Wang, under the pretext of helping He, defrauded He's mother, Madam Chen, of 105 yuan before fleeing. He was quickly released after the station determined he was not involved, and a warrant was issued for Wang Jiasheng's arrest. In mid-month, Huang Yingjie, a Chinese detective supervisor from the Lao Zha Station, and Bao Tan Wang Yifei arrested Wang on Jingzhou Road. The station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, charged him with offenses under Articles 370, 180, and 363 of the Criminal Law and filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, the First Special Court's Criminal Division, presided over by Judge Feng Shide, delivered the verdict yesterday morning. The main sentence was two years imprisonment for Wang Jiasheng's crime of false accusation as a repeat offender, and one year and six months imprisonment for his crime of fraud as a repeat offender, to be served concurrently for a total of three years. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Assassination Case on Malan Road</h3>
<p>The deceased, Du Nanxi, was originally a student at Fudan University and is currently an adjutant general of the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense Headquarters who came to Shanghai to marry a female classmate and suddenly met a tragic fate.</p>
<p>At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, a young man in a Western suit was suddenly assassinated in front of the entrance of No. 54, Puqing Lane, Malan Road, in the French Concession. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Young Man Shot Dead</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, a gunshot was suddenly heard at the entrance of Puqing Lane on Malan Road, near Avenue Dubailly in the French Concession. Residents of the lane initially paid little attention. However, a young man in a Western suit was soon found lying in a pool of blood in front of the entrance of No. 54. The young man had been shot once in the back of the head behind his left ear, but the bullet did not penetrate completely. The entire lane was immediately thrown into an uproar, and the lane manager immediately reported it to the police station.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Student</h3>
<p>The head of the detectives immediately ordered detectives to rush to the scene for inspection. However, the young man had already died for some time, so the body was transported to the morgue of the Tongren Fuyuan branch for an autopsy. A letter from Fudan University was found in the deceased's pocket. The detective then took the letter to Fudan for investigation, where it was confirmed that he was indeed a student of the university. Zhang Rong, a fellow student and compatriot of the deceased, personally identified the body at the morgue.</p>
<h3>Current Adjutant General</h3>
<p>According to Zhang Rong, a classmate of the deceased, the deceased's name was Du Nanxi, 26 years old, from Shizhu County, Sichuan Province. His original surname was Chen. The deceased was the third child in the family and was adopted into his maternal grandfather's family, the Du family, at a young age. His eldest brother, Chen Lanting, is currently the Commander and Division Commander of the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense. His second brother, Guangting, previously served as a regimental commander under his brother, and died of illness in 1931. At that time, the deceased was studying at Fudan University. Upon hearing the news of his brother's death, he returned to Sichuan in October of that year and took office as the Adjutant General of the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Met a Female Classmate</h3>
<p>The deceased initially graduated from Jiangbei Zhiping Middle School in Chongqing. He came to Shanghai in the spring of 1928 for self-study for half a year. After the summer vacation of that year, he went to Nanjing and audited classes at National Central University for one year. In the autumn of 1929, he entered Fudan University and studied in the Department of Municipal Administration. During that time, he became very close to Ding Yandao, a female classmate from the same department, from Jinshan Zhujing, and they became engaged. In the autumn of 1931, he heard the news of his second brother Guangting's death and returned to Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Came to Shanghai for Marriage</h3>
<p>After returning to Sichuan, the deceased served as the Adjutant General of the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense Headquarters until he took a plane from Hankou to Shanghai on the 21st of this month. It is said that this trip to Shanghai was specifically for the purpose of marrying Ding Yandao. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, he left the school to visit friends and said that he would return to school before lunch. Unexpectedly, he met with misfortune and passed away, resulting in an eternal farewell. The deceased's old mother is still alive, and her grief upon hearing this news can be imagined.</p>
<h3>No Political Motivation</h3>
<p>I (Zhang Jun, as he calls himself) was a classmate of the deceased three times and know his personality well. As for the cause of this murder, there is absolutely no political motivation. I fear that there must be special circumstances involved. If the police conduct a thorough investigation, the truth will inevitably come to light. As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>Wu Yuee from Dongting Mountain accuses.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of Zhou Xiangyun Case</h3>
<p>Yuee said she learned to prepare opium after following Zhou, while Xiangyun claimed never to have indulged in opium.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiangyun, the owner of a No. 1 automobile in this city, possesses tens of thousands of fortunes and is a famous wealthy man in Shanghai. Recently, Wu Yuee, a woman from Dongting Mountain, hired three lawyers - Fan Gang, Wu Kaisheng, and Huang Xiubo - to accuse him of enticement and abandonment in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The Special Court has already summoned him once, ordering Zhou to post bail and appear for another hearing at a later date. Yesterday morning was the date for the continuation of the hearing of this case. At 10:30 AM, Zhou, accompanied by his defense lawyers Li, He, and Peng, and three Chinese detectives and one Western detective from the Lao Zha Station, arrived at the court. The presiding judge, Feng Shide, then opened the court and summoned the witness Sheng Xingsun. According to the bailiffs' report, when they went to No. 37 Yongnian Lane, Baek Road, to summon him, a person surnamed Wang told them that there was no such person there, so they could not deliver the summons. Lawyer Fan Gang immediately stated that the plaintiff could accompany the bailiffs to identify and summon the witness next time. The court then summoned the witness Shen Zhu to the court. According to her testimony, she is 31 years old, from Dongting, and her father's name is Zhu Aitao. The defendant Zhou Xiangyun is a close friend of her father. In 1915, Zhou Xiangyun and Wu Yuee came to rent the east wing room on the upper floor of No. 100, Qinshou Lane, where she lived. They claimed to be husband and wife and agreed to pay a monthly rent of sixteen yuan. All the furniture in the room was made of rosewood. Zhou also came to spend the night every day until 1927 when they moved away. Zhou Xiangyun, however, testified that he had never met Shen Zhu and that none of his friends were named Zhu Aitao. Wu Yuee then claimed that there were two points she needed to add to her statement in court. One was that on April 8th or 9th of last year, Zhou Xiangyun instructed a bookkeeper named Shi to give her 200 yuan, saying that Zhou had gone to Nanjing and that there would be arrangements made when he came to Shanghai, but there was no news afterwards. Although she sent letters repeatedly, they were all ignored, and she had no choice but to file a lawsuit with the court. The second point was that she never knew how to prepare opium. After following Zhou, she learned the skill of preparing opium because Zhou was deeply addicted to opium. Every night, she had to prepare opium for him until 2:00 AM. She asked the court to pay attention to this point. Lawyer Ni (substitute for Lawyer Wu Kaisheng) then stated that the preliminary issue in this case was whether there was a relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. Zhou claimed that he had never met the plaintiff during the last hearing. Therefore, if it is necessary to prove that the plaintiff and the defendant are related, the plaintiff should bear the burden of proof. Today, the plaintiff claims that she only learned to prepare opium after marrying Zhou. Therefore, she asked the court to order a medical examiner to examine Zhou. If it is found that Zhou does have an opium addiction, then all the plaintiff's statements are false. She requested that the court order a medical examiner to examine Zhou immediately so that this case could be clarified. All problems could be solved easily. When questioned, Zhou Xiangyun claimed that the bookkeeper surnamed Shi did exist, and his name was Shi Guiqing, but he did not make any payments. He is currently in mourning and has returned to Ningbo. He can come to court next time. As for the opium addiction, he had no opium addiction at all, and he cannot even smoke cigarettes. At this point in the hearing, it was past noon, and the court adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>British and American Workers Engage in Full-Scale Fighting</h3>
<p>Two Gunshots Fired into the Air, Situation Serious</p>
<p>A group of workers in the leaf department of the British-American Tobacco Factory's new plant in Lujiazui, Pudong, had a dispute with Zhu Zhaolin, a foreman of the tin packing department from Shaoxing. Therefore, at the start of work at 1:00 PM yesterday, a large number of people gathered and waited at the entrance of the tin packing department. When they saw Zhu arrive, they immediately struck Zhu's head several times with iron bars. Zhu was in extreme pain and fell to the ground. He immediately pulled out his self-defense pistol and fired a shot into the air to break the siege. However, the pistol was immediately snatched away by Wang Daofu, one of the workers involved in the assault. At that time, workers from the tobacco silk department, Zhong Acheng, tin packing department workers Zhang Zhengqi and Zhang Yutang, and workshop worker Zhu Atang, etc., rushed over to check on the situation. The workers involved in the assault suspected that they were Zhu's accomplices and used weapons to attack them, causing serious injuries to Zhong and the other three. Subsequently, Ren Zhenxiang, a worker from the tin packing department, rushed over to mediate, but the workers who were fighting surrounded Ren. Seeing that the situation was not good, Ren also pulled out his pistol and fired a shot into the air as a warning. The situation was quite serious. The patrolling police stationed at the factory arrived, and the assailants scattered in all directions. Wang Daofu, who had snatched the pistol, and the assailants Xu Changfu and Yu Chenglin, etc., were arrested. Ren Zhenxiang's pistol was also confiscated and found to have a self-defense permit No. 5100 issued by the municipal government. Therefore, Wang Daofu's stolen pistol, as well as the three assailants, were escorted to the Third District. The five injured, with Zhu's injuries being the most severe, were all sent to the Tongren Hospital by the factory for treatment. However, Zhu and others firmly stated to the police that Shen Baokang, Tang Songlin, and Gao Jinyuan, etc., were directing them on the scene. Therefore, the Third District dispatched police to bring Shen and Tang to the district, where District Chief Zhang questioned the defendants and others separately. They were then personally escorted to the General Bureau for interrogation with a written report.</p>
<p>A Certain Party is Insidious</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Scrap Iron Purchases in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A Case Cracked in the Route D'Elisee Area</p>
<p>Cargo Loaded from the Shenjiawan Riverbank on Wusong Road and Delivered to the End of the Tram Tracks on North Sichuan Road</p>
<p>A certain party, due to a shortage of iron materials, is using unscrupulous individuals, enticing them with large profits, to purchase scrap iron. The incident in Yangjingzhen, Pudong, reported yesterday is only one of the recent cases discovered. Two or three days ago, a similar incident occurred in Zhabei, which was investigated and dealt with by the authorities. Subsequently, it was learned that there were still clues to be found. Fearing that once it was disclosed, the news would spread and the culprits would flee far away, the reporter respected the authorities' request and temporarily delayed disclosure. It is now learned that this case has come to a conclusion, and a supplementary account is provided.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws Fully Loaded with Scrap Iron</h3>
<p>At approximately 3:40 PM on the 20th of this month, Jin Quanhe, a post policeman of the 15th post of the 1st sub-station of the 5th District, was on duty at the Route D'Elisee post when he saw a rickshaw being pulled from south to north by four coolies. The rickshaw was covered with tattered burlap. When the rickshaw passed the police officer, the four coolies showed signs of panic. At the same time, the police officer saw that the rickshaw was heavily loaded and that the coolies seemed unable to handle it. The police officer questioned the coolies about what was on the rickshaw and lifted the burlap to inspect it, revealing that the entire rickshaw was full of scrap iron. When asked about where they came from and where they were going, they were evasive. The police officer became suspicious and took all the individuals to the station. Under interrogation by Director Liang of the sub-station, one of them, He Zongyu, 36 years old, from Nantong, another, Xu Guangda, 44 years old, from Dongtai, another, Xu Guangxing, 30 years old, from Dongtai, who is Guangda's brother, and another, Zhang Taixi, 30 years old, from Funing, who works as a rickshaw puller, confessed that they were hired by a person surnamed Ben to transport goods. They did not know anything else.</p>
<h3>End of the Tram Tracks</h3>
<p>After hearing the confession, Director Liang believed that since the rickshaw pullers knew the surname Ben, they must know the residence of this person. Although they were repeatedly questioned, the rickshaw pullers stubbornly refused to reveal the truth. In the end, Director Liang explained the benefits and drawbacks, and they finally confessed that they only knew the person with the surname Ben but did not know his exact location. As for how they became acquainted, it started because the person with the surname Ben often hired their rickshaws. At around 1:00 PM that afternoon, the person with the surname Ben hired their rickshaw again and instructed them to take the empty rickshaw to the riverbank near Shenjiawan on Wusong Road and wait for the goods to be unloaded from the ship. After the rickshaw was full, they were to turn into Route D'Elisee along Wusong Road and wait at the end of the tram tracks on North Sichuan Road, where someone would come to pick up the goods. He also stated that the rickshaw fare was one dollar and twenty cents. As for how the person with the surname Ben shipped the goods, they still insisted that they did not know. In order to understand the inside story, Director Liang had to continue to question them repeatedly, based on their confessions, for more than two hours. The rickshaw pullers ran out of excuses and knew that it would be difficult to hide the truth any longer. They then continued to confess that the goods were purchased by Xinjihao, which is located at No. 5, Bao'an Road. After Director Liang learned the inside story, he sent a staff member from the station to lead a police officer to the location by car to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>The Truth is Revealed</h3>
<p>Bao'an Road is under the jurisdiction of the 3rd sub-station of the 5th District. After the police officers arrived at their destination, they went to No. 5 together with the police officers from the 3rd sub-station and saw the Xinji sign outside the door. After entering and inquiring, they were only greeted by a partner who said that the owner had returned to his country a week ago and would return to Shanghai within days. The Xinji sign was recently changed. The purchase of scrap iron started as early as three years ago. His name is Wang Zhonghao, 28 years old, from Wuxi, with a monthly salary of twenty yuan. He was hired four years ago. As for what the scrap iron is used for, he really doesn't know. After the police officers learned the truth, they brought Wang back to the 1st sub-station for further questioning. However, when asked about the origin of the scrap iron, he still evaded the question. Director Liang believed that the origin of the scrap iron was unknown, or even stolen, and ordered that all the individuals be temporarily detained pending investigation to clarify the truth before handling the matter. He then reported the matter to the General Bureau for verification. It is learned that several stores subsequently requested the sub-station to allow Wang Zhonghao to be temporarily released on bail before the facts were clarified, and to be summoned at any time. Director Liang approved this, and Wang was released on bail by a reliable store. At the same time, he ordered all the police officers to conduct a thorough investigation. From this, it can be seen that the scrap iron in Yangjingzhen, Pudong, is one of its sources, the Shenjiawan riverbank on Wusong Road is its transfer point, and the end of the tram tracks on North Sichuan Road is its delivery point. As for opening a business, it is just a way to cover up their tracks and facilitate their activities.</p>

<h3>Robbers Open Fire, Mistakenly Killing Accomplice</h3>
<p>The Victim Fortunately Escaped</p>
<p>At approximately 1:00 PM yesterday, two robbers suddenly came to the home of Xuan Shikui at No. 1, Tongjia Bang straw shed, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, each holding a pistol, threatening and extorting money from the victim. Xuan could not comply. One of the robbers then used a lit candle to burn Xuan's right arm. While they were struggling, the candle was blown out by the wind. Xuan immediately seized the opportunity to break free and escape, shouting for help. One of the robbers, seeing that things were not going well, immediately took to his heels and fled. The other robber also followed him out. Seeing that Xuan was still shouting loudly and fearing that they would be caught, he desperately fired a shot at Xuan. However, the bullet hit the robber in front, who fell to the ground with a thud. At the same time, police officers from the nearby Tanjiaqiao sub-station and members of the security regiment stationed at the sub-station rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm, and went out to pursue the fleeing robber. They immediately returned to the station to report the incident and relayed it to the Fourth District General Office, which dispatched personnel to the scene to inspect the body of the deceased robber, who had been seriously injured, so that they could request an autopsy by the court. The deceased robber was wearing a short gray cloth jacket, a blue cloth cotton vest, blue cloth trousers, white socks, green canvas-soled shoes, and an old gray top hat. He was about 20 years old and had been shot in the chest about two inches above his right nipple, with the bullet remaining inside.</p>
<h3>Strange Beast Discovered in Beiwangpeng, Chuansha</h3>
<p>In Beiwangpeng, Chuansha, Pudong, a place along the coast, a large, dark black strange beast was suddenly discovered on the beach a few days ago. It is slightly larger than a cow and has hair-like steel needles all over its body, which are exceptionally sharp. It lurks in the reeds and has captured and eaten countless cattle, sheep, dogs, chickens, etc., raised by nearby villagers, and has bitten three or four villagers. Because they saw that it was fierce and dared not approach it, the news spread far and wide. The matter was heard by the water police, who went to shoot it. However, every time a shot was fired, it jumped into the sea. Later, it was shot with a volley, but it jumped in the same way. Therefore, all the villagers in the nearby area are extremely afraid. Some say that the beast is a seahorse, but it is not known for sure. This is recorded here for naturalists to verify.</p>

<p>Eveready and China Battery Factory</p>
<h3>Battery Trademark Appeal Resolved</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Cancels Trademark Bureau's Ruling</p>
<p>The trademark dispute between the American-owned National Carbon Eveready Battery Company and the China Battery Factory has lasted for several years. During the tenure of the former Director of the Trademark Bureau, Wen Wanqing, the Eveready Company was ruled to have lost. When He Zhuoxian succeeded as Director, the Eveready Company again applied for a re-examination. Last year, Director He again ruled that the China Battery Factory was the winner. The American-owned Eveready Company refused to accept the ruling and appealed to the Ministry of Industry, submitting various evidence to benefit the American company. The Trademark Bureau also submitted separate replies. The Ministry of Industry has now ruled on the appeal, and the main text reads: "The ruling of the Trademark Bureau's Ruling No. 55 and the ruling of Re-ruling No. 16 are revoked. The appellant's trademark should be actually used according to the original registered plane pattern, and should not be inserted into the dome of the battery. Its current method of use shall not be binding on others."</p>

<p>Chen Jinguang</p>
<h3>Suicide by Poisoning Due to Hardship</h3>
<p>Chen Jinguang, a 33-year-old man from Yangzhou, who resided at No. 589 Xinzha Road, had been making a living by setting up a pancake stall there. Recently, business has been poor, leading him to stop working at the stall. Since then, life has become even more difficult. Chen also had a wife, Zhang, and the couple has been living on borrowed money. Their clothes and other items have also been pawned. The other day, a friend of his asked Chen to repay a debt of seven yuan, which Chen could not repay at the time. He was very upset. He thought about the long road ahead and how he would make a living. After thinking about it, he became tired of life and secretly went out to buy 1.6 yuan worth of opium paste, which he secretly swallowed. At 8:00 PM, his wife saw her husband crying uncontrollably in bed with a pale face. Knowing that something was wrong, she took him to Baolong Hospital. The treatment was ineffective. The poison took effect at about 5:00 AM the next morning, and he died. The hospital reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which ordered Detective Ding Huaguo to go to the scene to investigate. He then transported the body to the examination room on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang Yaoguang, the prosecutor assigned by the First Special District Court, came to the office to verify the body and prepare the case file. According to Chen Zhang's statement, she is 35 years old. Her husband often complained due to economic difficulties. She did not expect him to resort to such a measure, taking poison and dying. She was very sad as she spoke, sobbing uncontrollably. After obtaining the statement, Zhang was ordered to verify that the deceased Chen Jinguang had indeed swallowed opium and died from poisoning. The body was handed over to his wife, Chen Zhang, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<p>It is true that they shared a bed.</p>
<h3>To Be Investigated Whether There Was Adultery</h3>
<p>Xin Xincai Wounds His Friend with a Knife</p>
<p>Xin's Wife's Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>Xin Xincai, a Ningbo native residing at No. 91 Haitian Lane, Waidama Road, works as a boatman. His wife, Qiu, is 35 years old and known for her promiscuous nature. Recently, she became romantically involved with Chen Axiang, who is from the same hometown. At 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, Chen took advantage of Xin's absence and secretly went to Xin's house for a rendezvous. Upon Xin's return, he caught Chen and Qiu in bed together. Overcome with anger, he used a kitchen knife to slash Chen's head and hands. Chen, wounded, fled the house, hired a rickshaw, and intended to return to his home at No. 47 Renchang Lane, Qiwupu Road. On the way, police officers No. 1382 and No. 1592 from the Yulin Road precinct noticed Chen's blood-soaked state and ordered the rickshaw to stop. After learning about the incident, they sent Chen to Tongren Hospital for treatment. They reported the matter to their supervisor, who dispatched detectives to arrest Xin. Xin, along with the murder weapon, was taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, described the events, stating that the victim's injuries at the hospital were severe, preventing him from appearing in court. However, according to Chen, he had been friends with the defendant for four years and had visited Xin to chat with his wife. Xin happened to come in and misunderstood, thinking there was something going on between them, and then attacked him with a knife. Further investigation revealed that the defendant's wife claimed she was not romantically involved with Chen. She said there was only one bed in the bedroom, so visitors often sat on the edge of the bed to talk. The police requested that she appear in court today to testify, but she was fearful and left home around 5:00 AM this morning and has not returned. However, Xin stated at the police station that the victim indeed had an intimate relationship with his wife and that he had warned Chen a month ago not to come to his house. However, yesterday Chen came again and was in bed with his wife, so he used a knife to wound him. The two sides have conflicting accounts. The case was requested to be postponed for further investigation. The kitchen knife, Chen's injury report, and bloodstained clothing were presented for examination. The defendant claimed that he witnessed Chen Axiang and his wife sleeping together in bed and that Chen turned off the light in the room. When he rushed in to investigate, Chen got up and used a piece of wood to strike him, so he grabbed the knife to defend himself. He asked for leniency. Wu Zehan, the presiding judge, ordered Xin Xincai to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing until the victim had recovered from his injuries.</p>
<h3>Two Corpses</h3>
<p>(Male) Yuan Guihe, a Hunan native, 48 years old, worked as a chief steward on a ship. He and Tian Furong from Tianjin were colleagues. Both were unemployed and facing financial difficulties, leading them to check into Room 41 of the Yuelai Inn on Limma Road in the Sixteen Pups district the day before yesterday. On that day, both Yuan and Tian went out separately to seek help from their fellow villagers. However, after a day of fruitless efforts, they returned disappointed. Yesterday morning, Tian went out to find friends, while Yuan remained alone in the room. Overwhelmed with worries, he hanged himself. The court confirmed that the death was by suicide. As no family members were found, it was ordered that the charitable organization provide a coffin and burial in the public cemetery, awaiting family recognition.</p>
<p>(Female) Yesterday, an unidentified female corpse surfaced in the Suzhou Creek on Zhongshan Road, Zhabei. She was approximately 40 years old, wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, with her hair in a bun. Her limbs were swollen and decomposed. The water patrol team discovered the body and detained it, ordering the local headman, Zhao Xifu, to report the matter to the local court for examination.</p>

<h3>Broadcasting Station</h3>
<p>Radio Novelist Telling Stories Zhongxi Broadcasting Station is the most elegant among the radio stations in Shanghai. All programs are mostly original. Previously, the novelist Huang Nanding was hired to broadcast the novel "Tian Yu Hua." It was unprecedented for a novelist to explain novels. However, due to time constraints, although it had been widely publicized for a long time, it failed to materialize. Recently, Lao Jinlong Foreign Company wanted to broadcast on the Zhongxi Radio Station, so they hired Huang to host, still explaining the novel "Tian Yu Hua." It started on the 21st of this month, and the time was scheduled from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM every night, totaling one hour. It has been five days since the start of the broadcast. Since Huang's enunciation is clear and the reasoning is clear, it has been widely welcomed. Its reputation is unmatched. With the talent of a novelist to explain novels, it is natural to have more than enough ability. It has gained a good reputation soon after the start, which is expected.</p>
<p>Worldwide Bible Society Broadcasts Lectures The Shanghai Worldwide Bible Study Association was initiated by Ms. Chen Shiyan of the Young Women's Christian Association. Ms. Chen, given the deepening national crisis and the confusion of people's hearts, believes that only the Christian doctrine can awaken the public. The association specifically broadcasts the audio recordings of lectures by Judge Lu Shufu of New York, USA, every Sunday afternoon from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM on Zhongxi Broadcasting Station (XGCD). The topic is Christianity and Justice. For the convenience and popularization of the audience, the association designates leaders of various churches in Shanghai to serve as translators every Sunday.</p>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>Recent Developments at Changshe Changshe, located on Heping Road, West Gate, is an organization formed by government officials and prominent figures in the business community in the city. It is a legitimate group for academic and recreational activities. The content includes Chinese martial arts, Chinese music, Peking opera, drama, Kunqu opera, art, publishing, ball games, and other activities. The facilities are complete, and there are more than 200 members. Now, since the recruitment began, the number of members has increased sharply, and the organization has developed rapidly. The original building is not enough to use. With the resolution of the council of the organization, the site of the organization will be expanded, and the stage, gym, and several bathrooms will be added, which is convenient for the society.</p>
<h3>Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>Another Painter Added to Shanghai Mr. Tang Dingzhi of Wujin, a famous painter, is the great-grandson of Lord Zhenmin and the grandson of Mr. Le Min. In addition to landscapes, he also specializes in pine, plum, orchid, and bamboo paintings. Since the Republic of China, he has lived in the old capital, earning a living from calligraphy and painting for twenty years. This time, he left Pingnan and returned. Those who make friends and ask for paintings follow one another. Therefore, he is urged to live in Shanghai and sell paintings. From then on, another colorful brush has been added to the art world in Shanghai. The receiving address is No. 1014, next to Qingliang Temple in Xin's Family Garden, Xinzha Road.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently saw in today's (24th) local news section of your newspaper an article regarding the incident of over-arrests by the French Concession, publishing a letter from French Consul-General Meyrier to the Mayor of Shanghai. The wording is somewhat different from the original text. Upon investigation, the original letter states "based on our letter No. 1711 of the 13th of this month," which your newspaper mistakenly printed as 172. Also, the word "放" (fang) was mistakenly printed instead of "於" (yu) in the phrase "實彈於槍" (live ammunition in the gun). It is feared that readers may be misled. I am sending this letter to your editor-in-chief, requesting that you investigate and correct the error. Sincerely, French Consulate General in Shanghai, March 24th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, The motorcycle competition on the 26th of this month is organized by the American Motorcycle Association. Our association has no connection with this association. To avoid misunderstandings among the public and motorcycle enthusiasts, we hereby declare this. We kindly ask for your attention. The Chinese Motorcycle Association.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Along the Shandong coast, cloudy with strong northeasterly winds. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, cloudy with drizzle or heavy fog, with winds from the north to east. Along the coast south of Ma'an Island, hazy weather with variable winds, due to a low pressure system passing over southwestern China and moving northeast-eastward. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 46.4 degrees and the lowest was 40.5 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 60.1 degrees and the lowest was 37.0 degrees.</p>

<h3>Love and Patriotism: Two Divergent Paths</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Zhou Zhun of Jiangyin丨</p>
<p>I currently have a difficult problem. In the Republic of China, young people, adults, and those in agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and the military are all focused on the issue of love. In this new era and trend, it should be openly discussed to understand the joys and sorrows of life. I cannot say that I am from the old generation, nor can I call myself completely part of the new trend. I ultimately choose the good from both the old and the new as a goal for my life. However, in this troubled country, in China with its deepening foreign troubles, in the territory of Rehe lost less than a month ago, patriotic people with loud voices are making great efforts and shouting madly. The sound of awakening waves is arousing not a few people, but those who are drunk and dreaming in love and lust are even more countless. Even in your Advisor section, there is not a day without revealing marriage and love issues. Although you gentlemen give very sincere answers, you believe that revealing these issues is guiding the lost, unloved, and love-possessed young heroes. By following the advice given and doing it gradually, results can be achieved. Generally, ambitious young people are indeed unwilling to use their energy to study. Of course, in modern times, the only two noteworthy paths are love and saving the country. These two paths can receive very good reputations in the current trend. Those who discuss love are constantly researching how to improve it. Those who pay attention to the national crisis are constantly reading newspapers, thinking, giving lofty speeches, and doing various work such as propaganda and fundraising. Love is enough to endanger the country and weaken the race (if successful). Gentlemen, to make those who study love become people who pay attention to national affairs, from which aspect should we proceed to promote this change? Please publish a very detailed and alarming introduction to achieve my desired result. Thank you! Please disclose this in the near future.</p>
<p>Answer: The question you have raised is very important and worthy of discussion by the general readership. Now, first, according to the reporter's limited knowledge, I will contribute a suggestion for the public's reference. We receive many letters every day discussing love issues. To be honest, the space in this column is limited. If we were to publish them one by one, then there would be no room to discuss other issues. Moreover, China has reached such a point, and a group of young people are still immersed in the gentle fragrance of love, calling each other "sweet brother" and "honey sister." "Chen Shubao is truly heartless!" This statement cannot be denied! However, this is really just our temporary emotional argument. If we analyze it from the perspective of social class relations, then these young people of the middle and small bourgeoisie are well-fed and living comfortably. Knowing what national prosperity or decline is, they naturally do not talk about love and have nothing to chat about. It is true that there are also a few young people who still have revolutionary spirit. When they have no way to go, they often turn to the path of love, consciously tending towards depravity. We have naturally not given up hope on this group of people. However, we must offend most of our friends who are currently talking about love with one sentence: there is really no hope! As the saying goes, "Wu Dalang kicking, his moves are not very high!" So when they ask us about love, we usually don't answer them, or we answer them with one sentence: "If you are comfortable, then do it! As for me, I have no time!" However, we must distinguish: those who have time to talk about love are only a few young people of the leisure class. Most of the young people of the poor masses do not talk about love and have no time to talk about love. The future and the present national affairs will be placed on their shoulders. Our eyes should be focused on these young people. We are willing to do our best to provide some foolish advice, to be experienced guides, or to discuss the issue of saving the country with them. I say this, and many people will definitely disagree, thinking that I am neglecting the future of these young people. Can't we transform them and make them walk on another bright and upright path? If these young people of the middle and small bourgeoisie do not have a revolutionary environment, especially in a colony-like China, it is very difficult to influence them to engage in active struggle. As you said, "To make those who study love become people who pay attention to national affairs," I am ashamed to say that we dare not take on this responsibility! Do not misunderstand, we oppose talking about love, not from a moral point of view. On the contrary, we are not ascetics. We do not consider sexual life to be lighter than eating and wearing clothes. However, there is a difference: if you don't eat, you will starve to death in a few days; if you don't wear clothes, you will freeze to death in a few days; if you don't talk about love, you will not die. Moreover, this kind of problem is simply much simpler for the working masses. As Yi Liying said, "The youth movement is suffering from modern diseases in its attitude towards the issue of sexuality, and in its exaggerated discussion of the issue of sexuality. The word 'modern' gives a sense of sarcasm, and as always, it is making strange faces. … Such wrong concepts in the youth movement are harmful and dangerous. These concepts can easily help some of them to engage in excessive and exaggerated behaviors in their sexual lives, wasting the health and strength of young people. You must oppose this phenomenon. There is not a single link between the women's movement and the youth movement. Women comrades must systematically work together with young people, which is a kind of continuation, expansion and promotion of motherhood from the individual to the social aspect. And all the conscious social life and actions of women must be encouraged, so that they can break the boundaries of their vulgar individualist family and clan mentality. …" From this passage, we extract the most important sentence to make the conclusion of this article, which is: "Women comrades must systematically work together with young people." That is to say, only when young men and women work together in the revolutionary struggle, in today's terms, working together in the Anti-Japanese War, is the fundamental way to develop the social life and actions of young men and women! What do you think?</p>

<h3>Choosing a Radio (I)</h3>
<p>— Xiong</p>
<p>If you want to have a radio, which type is best? From the simplest crystal radio to the most complex superheterodyne, there are countless types. Within the same type, there are those that use DC electricity, those that use AC electricity, and even those that use AC electricity and are the same type but have various brands. Which machine should you purchase? Which brand is good? This question is really difficult to answer.</p>
<p>Generally, a good radio should possess the following qualities:</p>
<p>(1) Sensitive</p>
<p>(2) Good selectivity</p>
<p>(3) Clear and loud sound</p>
<p>(4) No noise</p>
<p>(5) Stable operation</p>
<p>(6) Easy to use</p>
<p>(7) Low price and low maintenance costs</p>
<p>Sensitivity is generally proportional to the number of vacuum tubes. However, even with the same number of vacuum tubes and the same wiring method, sensitivity can still vary. This is due to the quality of the components used and whether they are properly arranged and fully wired. It is difficult to make a definitive statement without actually testing each radio.</p>
<p>To receive weak radio waves from distant places, high-frequency amplification is essential. A well-designed high-frequency amplifier is naturally sensitive. However, whether the detection process is good or not is also of great importance to the sensitivity of the radio.</p>
<p>Selectivity refers to the ability to easily isolate unwanted radio waves. For high-frequency circuits, the selectivity is excellent when the tuning of the oscillating circuit is sensitive. In terms of different types, the selectivity of crystal radios is the worst. Vacuum tube radios with high-frequency amplification and those that utilize appropriate regenerative action are better. As for superheterodyne radios that are designed using special principles, their excellent selectivity is unparalleled.</p>
<p>The clearest sound is from crystal radios. This is universally acknowledged. Loud sound depends on low-frequency amplification. However, if the low-frequency amplification is poorly designed, the sound is prone to distortion. The presence or absence of noise depends on the quality of the components and the quality of the wiring, but it also depends on the local situation. The price, maintenance costs, and ease of use all depend on the internal structure of the radio and the power source used. For example, an AC radio can save on maintenance costs, but the clarity of the sound is not as good as that of a DC radio. Crystal radios are very convenient in all respects, but there are trade-offs. If you want the radio to have a long range, sensitivity, and selectivity at the same time, it is not possible.</p>
<p>In short, in the current situation, there is really no perfect radio that can be adopted by everyone. We can only examine our own needs and use them as a standard for making choices.</p>
<h3>A Small Experience</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Zhihong</p>
<p>丨Using a Milliammeter to Replace a Voltmeter丨</p>
<p>A small experience that I gained from experimentation and that is consistent with theory is using a milliammeter to replace a voltmeter to measure the voltage in a circuit. Although it is not a very surprising experience, it is something that those who repair electrical equipment and those who like to study should pay attention to, because when you want to carefully find out where the damage to the equipment is, you must use a voltmeter and a milliammeter to measure it. If either of them is missing, this work may be stopped.</p>
<p>The fact is this: several formulas that are stipulated in our theory.</p>
<p>(1) Voltage (volts) = Current (amperes) × Resistance (ohms)</p>
<p>(2) Current (amperes) = Voltage (volts) / Resistance (ohms)</p>
<p>(3) Resistance (ohms) = Voltage (volts) / Current (amperes)</p>
<p>C 100,000 OHMS 100V 150 200 300 500</p>
<p>B 100,000 OHMS 10 V 15 20 30 50 80 100</p>
<p>A 1,000 OHMS 1. V 1.5 2 3 5 8 10</p>
<p>If we specify one milliampere on our milliammeter, and now we want to use it as one volt, in other words, we want one milliampere to equal one volt, then according to what is said in our first formula, to make volts equal to milliamperes, we must connect a resistor. So we should first find the resistance in ohms.</p>
<p>Resistance (ohms) = Voltage (volts) / Current (amperes) = 1 volt / 1 milliampere = 1 / 0.001 = 1000 ohms</p>
<p>Now, connect this 1,000-ohm resistor to the milliammeter, and you can use it to measure voltage.</p>
<h3>Arago 丨The Discoverer of Magnetizable Iron</h3>
<p>— KP</p>
<p>François Arago was a French physicist and astronomer, born in the Pyrenees in 1786 and died in Paris in 1853. His life was full of twists and turns, with a dramatic meaning. He was originally a businessman, but later volunteered to be a soldier. After passing the test, he officially joined the army, but during the battle, he was captured by the enemy, survived nine deaths and only escaped alive. He then switched to working for the Paris Measurement Institute, closely exploring the relationship between the aurora and a certain magnetism and electricity and the Earth's magnetism. He also studied whether the magnetism of a current passing through a wire is equal in any place, and found that iron filings scattered around the wire can be attracted when a current passes through it. He also discovered that if a coil with a steel needle inside is energized, the iron needle is not only temporarily magnetized, but becomes permanently magnetized. However, Arago was not the only one who discovered the permanent magnetization of iron needles. David of England also made the same discovery, and the time of his discovery was almost simultaneous with Arago, which is really an interesting coincidence.</p>
<h3>Important Points to Note When Repairing Radios</h3>
<p>— Group Return</p>
<p>The structure of a radio receiver can be described as both extremely complex and extremely simple. Some may find this statement odd, but if one examines the interior of a radio, with its crisscrossing and colorful wiring, and the randomly arranged components of various shapes and sizes, it certainly appears extremely complex. However, if one were to dissect it piece by piece, one would find that, apart from the vacuum tubes, it consists only of capacitors, coils, and resistors. The only difference lies in the circuit design. Therefore, anyone attempting to repair a radio must first understand the circuit and its function before proceeding, which will make the task much easier.</p>
<p>Once the circuit is understood, it becomes easier to begin. However, as the saying goes, "A skilled craftsman must first sharpen his tools." Before starting, one must prepare the necessary tools, otherwise, the repair may not be successful and some parts may even be damaged.</p>
<p>Next is the use of testing instruments. Since the radio cannot produce sound due to a malfunction, human ears cannot detect the problem. One must rely on instruments, which are various types of electrical meters.</p>
<p>The key points for inspecting a radio can be divided into two categories: A. Mechanical aspects (commonly known as "hard failures") and B. Electrical aspects. Physical damage, such as broken or cracked components, falls under category A. If components lose their effectiveness, they fall under category B. Then, repair or replace them by category. This work is not inherently difficult. However, current amateur repairers often disassemble parts without understanding the problem, ultimately becoming stuck and giving up. This is a common occurrence, so I offer these words as an introduction.</p>
<h3>Radio Troubleshooting and Repair (1)</h3>
<p>— AA</p>
<p>I originally planned to write an article on "How to Maintain a Radio," but I felt that the topic was too broad and decided to save it for later. Now, let's discuss some essential knowledge: radio troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Common radio problems include: 1. No sound at all; 2. Low volume; 3. Intermittent sound; 4. Static noise; 5. Inaccurate sound; 6. Poor separation of stations. This article will address these six problems by explaining their symptoms, causes, and solutions.</p>
<p>1. No Sound at All</p>
<p>A perfectly good radio suddenly produces no sound at all. This is obviously due to internal damage, but where is the damage? Is it a fatal injury? You must find out yourself to decide whether to attempt the repair yourself, send it to the manufacturer, or buy a new one. How do you check? Please read the table below:</p>
<p>Phenomenon　　 Cause　　 Solution</p>
<p>Vacuum tube does not light up</p>
<p>Vacuum tube filament broken　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>Poor contact between vacuum tube socket and pins　 Ensure complete contact</p>
<p>Poor switch contact (AC)　 Improve contact</p>
<p>Fuse blown (AC)　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>Battery connection broken (DC)　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>Vacuum tube lights up but no sound is heard</p>
<p>Low-frequency choke coil broken (AC)　 Rewind or replace with a new one</p>
<p>C-voltage bleeder resistor broken (AC)　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>Bypass capacitor defective (AC)　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>Speaker coil broken　 Rewind or replace with a new one</p>
<p>Speaker connection broken　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>B battery defective (DC)　 Inspect and repair the defect or replace with a new one</p>
<p>Battery connection broken (DC)　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>Speaker produces a "crackling" sound but no audio</p>
<p>Low-frequency transformer broken　 Rewind or replace with a new one</p>
<p>Coil broken　 Reconnect the break</p>
<p>Wires touching or loose connections　 Isolate the touching wires and reconnect the broken ones</p>
<p>Defective vacuum tube　 "Revive" it or replace with a new one</p>
<p>C-voltage bleeder resistor broken (AC)　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>High-frequency choke coil broken　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>Voltage regulator resistor broken　 Replace with a new one</p>
<p>The causes listed in the table that are specific to AC radios are marked with "(AC)," and those specific to DC radios are marked with "(DC)," for ease of inspection.</p>
<p>If your radio exhibits any of the above symptoms, feel free to use the table to troubleshoot. You might be able to fix it yourself!</p>
<p>Next time, we'll discuss troubleshooting and repairing low volume issues.</p>

<h3>All About Antennas (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yunchiao</p>
<p>Types and Installation Methods</p>
<p>Antennas can be broadly divided into two types: 1. Outdoor antennas, including various elevated types; and 2. Indoor antennas, including loop types. They are described below:</p>
<h3>(Figure 1) 123456</h3>
<p>(A) Outdoor Antennas (1) Single Wire Type: The single wire antenna (as shown in Figure 1) is the most common type of antenna. It is convenient to install and does not take up much space. In the diagram, 1 is the pole, which can be made of sturdy bamboo or wood. Power stations often use iron poles, about ten meters high, the higher the better. 2 is the insulator, preferably made of glass. It is available in the market; porcelain is second best. Ordinary three-wire white material used for installing electric lights can also be used as a substitute, but the effectiveness is lower. 3 is the antenna wire, which can be made of 18-gauge bare copper wire, about 20 to 50 meters long. Commercially available antennas are made of seven strands of 22-gauge copper wire, some with a tin coating to prevent corrosion from wind and rain. Copper wire with insulation can also be used for antennas, with the same effect, but it adds unnecessary weight. 4 is the lead-in wire, which can be ordinary insulated wire. One end is connected to the antenna, and the other end is connected to the radio. The connection points of each wire should be soldered firmly to reduce electrical resistance and prevent rusting and loosening. The lead-in wire is part of the antenna and should not be too long, otherwise the selectivity will be poor. The contact points with the walls of the house must be insulated. 5 is the connection wire between the antenna and the insulator, which can be made of rope or lead wire. 6 is the pulley, and 7 is the guy wire, used to raise and lower the antenna for easy inspection.</p>
<p>Radio Knowledge</p>
<h3>(III) Classification of Electric Current</h3>
<p>— Micro</p>
<p>Although electric current is a flow of electrons, it flows in various ways. For example, if there is a wire and the current flows from end A to end B, and the direction of flow remains constant and the magnitude is always the same, then this is called direct current, or pure direct current. Conversely, if the direction of the current changes from A to B and then from B to A, and the magnitude also changes with time, then this is called alternating current. When the current flows from A to B, it increases from 0 to a maximum value and then decreases back to 0. Then the current reverses direction, increasing from 0 to a maximum value and then decreasing back to 0. If this process repeats continuously at a low rate of times per second, it becomes a low-frequency alternating current. Ordinary electric lighting uses alternating current, with a repetition rate of only 50 to 60 times per second. The hum heard in AC radios is due to this. If the repetition rate is high, it becomes an oscillating current. The oscillating current in radio typically oscillates at tens of thousands to tens of millions of times per second (the number of repetitions is the frequency).</p>
<p>If you connect the positive and negative terminals of a dry cell battery with a wire, the current flows. If you repeatedly break and reconnect this wire, interrupting the current flow, the current still flows in one direction, it is still direct current, but it is flowing intermittently. The same is true for alternating current; if it is interrupted, it becomes intermittent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if an alternating current is superimposed on a direct current flowing through a wire, the direction of the current does not change, but the magnitude of the current changes according to the frequency of the alternating current. For example, in the vacuum tube used in radio, the circuit from the plate to the filament (described later) is connected to direct current, but after receiving alternating waves, alternating current flows in the connected wire. The current flowing in this wire is direct current with an alternating current component.</p>
<p>In addition, alternating current and oscillating current can be further divided into constant amplitude and decaying amplitude. Constant amplitude means that the maximum value of the current is always the same. Decaying amplitude means that the current gradually decreases until it reaches zero. The spark-gap transmitter used in old-fashioned wireless telegraphy uses a decaying and intermittent oscillating current. The oscillating current generated by vacuum tubes today is constant amplitude and continuous.</p>
<p>Moreover, if a method is used to vary the magnitude of the oscillating current, sometimes large and sometimes small, it becomes an irregular oscillating current. This is called amplitude modulation. If the change in the magnitude of the current can match the pitch, loudness, and rhythm of various sounds, then transmitting sound becomes much easier. The following diagrams illustrate various types of current. The vertical lines above and below the horizontal line represent the direction of the current, and the height of the curve represents the magnitude of the current. Since the magnitude of direct current remains constant, it forms a straight line above the horizontal line. Alternating current forms a curve (this curve is called a sine wave). An amplitude-modulated oscillating current forms a curve with varying heights, as shown in diagram G. There are also situations where two or three alternating currents overlap or where alternating current is rectified, but these will not be discussed in detail here.</p>

<p>(III) Unit of Voltage</p>
<p>Water flows from point A to point B due to the difference in potential energy (i.e., pressure) between the two points. In electricity, the reason for the flow of electricity from point A to point B is attributed to the difference in electrical potential energy (i.e., electrical potential), which is called potential difference. However, in electrical engineering, it is commonly referred to as voltage. In a certain sense, it is also called electromotive force. The unit of voltage is called the volt. The volt is derived from units of force and energy, with the following relationship:</p>
<p>Dyne: The unit of force, which is the force required to accelerate a one-gram mass by one centimeter per second squared.</p>
<p>Erg: The unit of work or energy, which is the work done by a force of one dyne moving one centimeter or the energy possessed. One joule is equal to ten million ergs. Volt: The unit of voltage, which is the voltage when one coulomb of charge has a difference of one joule of energy between point A with higher electrical potential and point B with lower electrical potential.</p>
<p>The electromotive force of a Weston cell is approximately 1.0183 volts at 20 degrees Celsius, so it can be used as a practical standard for calculating voltage.</p>
<p>Voltage or electromotive force is represented by the letters V or E in formulas.</p>
<p>There are several other units for measuring larger or smaller voltages:</p>
<p>(Symbol kV) = 1000 volts</p>
<p>(Symbol mV) = 1/1000 volt</p>
<p>(Symbol uV) = 1/1,000,000 volt</p>

<h3>Esperanto Radio Course</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The Shanghai Esperanto Association (S.E.A.), founded in 1908 and long-respected, has recently launched an "Esperanto Radio Course" (Radio Esperanto Kurso) on Shanghai Radio Station (XHHS). It is taught twice a week (Mondays and Saturdays) from 6:40 PM to 7:10 PM. Each session includes a lecture and an Esperanto song before the lesson. Today (Saturday, March 25th) is the first session of the "Esperanto Radio Course." The station's frequency is 1100 kilocycles. Those interested in studying Esperanto should not miss this opportunity and tune in at the designated time. (The Chinese Radio Magazine's 6th issue has the Esperanto textbook. Inquiries can be sent to "Shanghai P.O. Box 1332").</p>
<h3>Win a Radio in a Science Guessing Game</h3>
<p>The Railway Industry Exhibition, sponsored by Jiaotong University in this city, is about to open. It is reported that the Chinese Wireless Electric Research Company, a Chinese merchant company, has been invited to participate in the exhibition and display Chinese-made radio sets, talking picture machines, and all of its products. During the exhibition period, the company will hold a science guessing game with grand prizes to reward visitors and encourage Chinese people to study radio. Anyone can participate for free. The first and second prizes are exquisite radio sets. The game involves guessing the capacitance of a variable capacitor made by the company itself. The closest guess wins the first prize, and there are various smaller prizes as well. Those who want to know more details can contact the company's sales department (Continental Arcade No. 314, telephone 93390).</p>
<h3>Austrian Security Radio Stations</h3>
<p>In some parts of Austria, well-equipped security broadcasting stations have been established for a long time, and now they have become widespread throughout the country. These security broadcasting stations are only set up in one location, but they can communicate with shortwave broadcasting stations in other locations. Therefore, Austrian police can quickly broadcast information without disturbing other radio waves. (Philips Company)</p>
<h3>Increase in German Radio Listeners</h3>
<p>The number of radio listeners in Germany has recently increased rapidly. In October of last year, there were only 4,077,347 registered listeners, but by January of this year, it had increased to 4,307,722. In just three months, the number increased by 230,375. This shows the progress of the radio industry in Germany. However, there was a temporary decrease last summer. (Philips Company)</p>

<p>Philco's New Radio</p>
<p>To eliminate noise interference in radio reception is easy. With the increasing power of new stations, it is difficult to separate stations from elsewhere. In the current broadcasting situation, the only audio selection method that can eliminate such drawbacks is the balanced neutrodyne system. The clear sound quality of Philco radios is due to the use of this balanced neutrodyne system.</p>
<p>By 1932, Philco Radio had reached a solid position with strong capital and excellent products. It now manufactures 12,500 radio sets daily and has been adopted by major laboratories, specialists, and engineers. Furthermore, Philco Radio Company continues its research, such as in wireless television. The future development is limitless.</p>
<p>Philco Radio Company's distribution office and showroom are located at No. 96 Nanjing Road. It is said that visitors are very welcome.</p>
<p>Great China Four-Tube Radio's Bestseller</p>
<p>The Wanjin brand four-tube radio sold by the Dahua Radio Company at No. 9 Sanma Road in this city is the latest rectangular model, using six-pin tubes. The power supply is equipped with a four-inch high canopy that does not get hot after prolonged use and is not easily damaged. The circuit is neat and the speaker is reliable. It is "worthy of being called a high-quality product" and is also reasonably priced. Therefore, many people are buying it every day.</p>
<p>New Machine from United States Radio Corporation</p>
<p>The United States Radio and Television Corporation of Marion, Indiana, has released several new U.S. radios, which are said to have excellent construction. Even the five-tube model is equipped with two of the latest vacuum tubes: No. 57, a screen-grid pentode amplifier with 21/2 pounds of electricity, is more effective than the No. 24 screen-grid; and No. 58, a 21/2 pound triple screen-grid super-control amplifier, is equipped with the latest filament with a current of one ampere. In the nine-tube model, all tubes except the rectifier tube are the latest type. The twelve-tube model is entirely made with the latest type of tubes and comes with a No. 82 mercury vapor rectifier tube. At the previous Chicago Radio Products Exhibition, the radio sets on display with this new type of tube were limited to twelve or thirteen-tube models.</p>
<p>Solving Radio Problems</p>
<p>When a radio has problems, the most obvious symptom is that it does not work. If there is noise, crackling, intermittent sound, fluctuating volume, or other strange sounds inside the radio, it indicates that there is a serious problem inside the radio.</p>
<p>Originally, the radio internal circuits are numerous and the components are complex, and further examination does not easily know the crux of the difficulty. This purchaser of radio sets, whenever encountering this difficulty, is regarded as a painful matter. The Yadah Company, located at No. 25 Renji Road in this city, has established a repair department to solve radio problems. Mr. Xu Zhifang, the former chief engineer of Kailuo Company and Wheeler Company, has been hired to specialize in repairing various radios for all sectors of society. No matter what serious difficulties arise, they can be repaired within a limited time and well done. The price is very low, and they can issue a warranty to ensure satisfaction. It is also reported that the company has recently transported a large number of highly developed brand of radio receivers, which are durable, clear in sound, and fairly priced. Many people from all walks of life have come to purchase them.</p>
<h3>Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company's Achievements Over the Past Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Dan</p>
<p>(III) Increased Maritime Radio Applications</p>
<p>Over the past year, the technology of sea-to-land radio telephones has also made considerable progress. It is very convenient and reliable for sailors to use, and now almost all ships are equipped with this type of maritime radio equipment.</p>
<p>Maritime direction-finding methods have made astonishing progress every year and can be said to be the most useful area of research. Marconi automatic wireless telegraphs with detailed reporting have increased by three in the Oushaga Coast during the year. Two Marconi ship markers, which were established in 1930 on an island near the China Sea, were also added last year near the Yangtze River estuary and along the important routes of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The first Marconi rotating direction indicator was applied to Rangoon Port (Volt Meter). The form is simple and is not equipped with radio, but it is very convenient to use.</p>
<p>A new type of maritime radio was applied in the British Postal Authority and was completely successful. Eleven British seaside stations are equipped with Marconi radio telephones by the Postal Authority to communicate with ships equipped with simple telephones. There are already 13 ships equipped with this type of telephone.</p>

<h3>Success of Radio Reception in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>— Zheng Geyu</p>
<p>This time, when I returned to my hometown from Shanghai, I originally prepared a well-performing five-tube radio, but because of export issues, it was prohibited from being released by customs, so I had to take another two-tube radio and mixed the vacuum tube parts into my bag and smuggle it through, and put the five-tube radio on hold in Shanghai.</p>
<p>When I arrived at my destination (Gulangyu, Xiamen), I tried to assemble these parts into a three-circuit regenerative three-tube radio.</p>
<p>The antenna was borrowed from a friend, a length of less than thirty feet of enamel wire, using two bamboo poles and glass insulators, installed north-south on the top of a two-story building. The lead-in wire used 18-gauge insulated wire, connected to the north of the antenna. The ground wire to the laboratory used 22-gauge galvanized iron wire, buried in about a foot of sandy soil, with a large resistance, and the radio reception was greatly reduced. However, due to location conditions and economic reasons, this had to be the case!</p>
<p>After the radio was installed, I started to test the reception at about 4 pm. When I connected the ground wire and rotated the dial of the variable capacitor, XGOA Nanjing radio station and Taiwan JFAK, Tokyo IOAK, Philippines KZRM several broadcasting stations emitted very clear and loud sounds in the headphones. After connecting the antenna, the speaker could also clearly and loudly hear. After nightfall, XGY Zhejiang Provincial Radio Station, Shanghai American Company, Great China, Dongfang, and Zhongxi could also be received with the speaker. There were also many unknown Japanese, Shanghai, and Cantonese broadcasting stations. The specifications of the radio and power supply parts are explained below:</p>
<h3>Headphones or Speaker</h3>
<p>L1L2L3 are ordinary one-circuit coils CI0005 twenty-three turns or twenty-one turns variable capacitor, C2.00025 fixed capacitor,</p>
<p>C3C4,</p>
<p>C9.C8, C10 are 1mfd capacitors, C6C7 are 2Mfd capacitors, C5 is a .002 branch capacitor, Ri2Meg, R22000, R3 is a 30 ohm variable resistor, R4,2800, R52250 R63650, R74000, TI, T2, are 3I low-frequency transformers, CH is a 30 Henry 30 Ampere low-frequency choke coil, S is the power switch, F is a one-ampere fuse.</p>
<p>V, is a 224 vacuum tube, V2 is a 227, V3 is a 112. The filament current is supplied by a 6-volt 120 ampere storage battery, and the plate voltage is supplied by a DC B-power supply. (If you want to use electric light for A-power, you must design it separately)</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Amateur radio enthusiast Mr. Yang has manufactured a five-watt transmitter, which has been tested and the sound is loud within 30 to 50 miles. It has been tested in every big box office for two months and has achieved excellent results. Recently, I am leaving Shanghai for business, and I am willing to sell it at a low price. Those who want to buy it can contact Mr. Li Tinghou of Dahua Radio Company at No. 9 Sanma Road.</p>

<p>Inspects Provincial and County Schools Despite Strong Winds and Rain</p>
<p>Goes to Provincial Changzhou High School to Summon Students for Instructions</p>
<p>And Visits Historical Sites of National Resistance Against the Enemy</p>
<p>(Special Communication from Changzhou) Director Zhou inspected various sections in Changzhou yesterday and has recorded in this newspaper. This morning (the 23rd) at 8 o'clock, in strong winds and rain, he continued to inspect Provincial Changzhou High School, including Junior One English, Junior Two Chinese, Junior Three Geometry, Senior One Groups A and B Algebra Logic, Senior Two Groups A and B Algebra Physics, Senior Three Groups A and B English Chinese, and inquired about the school's administration and teaching situation in all aspects, adding detailed guidance. The school's back garden has the famous historic Kasaya Pagoda, the place where Monk Wan'an led monks to resist the Hu Yuan at the end of the Song Dynasty and died. A Ming Jiajing stele is inlaid in front of the pagoda, recording a poem by Wan'an when he commanded the righteous army, with the sentence "In times of crisis, temporarily act as a general, after the change, return to being a monk." Director Zhou regarded this pagoda as the story of Duanzu resisting the enemy, and took photos together to express his admiration. He then inspected Tianning Elementary School, and because it was established by the monks of Tianning Temple, he went to visit the temple for a week. He returned to the residence for lunch. At 1:00 pm, heavy rain poured down, thunder and lightning struck, and the weather suddenly turned cold. Director Zhou and others braved the cold to inspect the County Junior High School, examining the school's administration and teaching methods, and inspecting the teaching and self-study rooms and dormitories of all grades, and gave detailed guidance on the life of counselors and students. The examination was particularly thorough regarding the points for improvement proposed by Supervisor Jin of the Department during the inspection. He then went to the Private Changzhou High School to inspect the teaching of all grades and ordered the students' grades to be sent to his residence for review. Later, he went to the Education Bureau and the Mass Education Center to inquire about everything. It was already 6 o'clock. He returned to his residence for dinner. At 7 o'clock, he went to Provincial Changzhou High School to give instructions, briefly dividing them into four points: study hard, maintain order, be polite, and exercise. His words were concise and earnest. The students listened quietly for more than an hour without any sign of fatigue. It is scheduled to inspect County Women's Normal School and other schools tomorrow and give instructions to the entire education community. (Sent on March 23rd)</p>
<p>Boy Scout Headquarters</p>

<p>The above regulations, etc., were promulgated yesterday (the 24th) to all Boy Scout organizations nationwide for compliance. It is heard that the headquarters and the preparatory office are concerned that Boy Scout instructors in various places may not all be proficient in military knowledge. Whether the outline, which only has articles, can be implemented for training accordingly is also a question. The staff of various departments of the General Association has begun to compile courses for printing and distribution, so that instructors can have something to follow and achieve effective results. Before the courses are compiled, several publications will be designated as temporary textbooks, it is said.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Astronomy and Mathematics Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussion and approval of university astronomy and mathematics curriculum standards</p>
<p>Setting standards for instruments and unifying astronomical and mathematical terminology</p>
<p>Last August, the Beiping Mathematics and Physics Society held its annual meeting, and the Chinese Physical Society was established at the same time. The Ministry of Education and the National Compilation and Translation Bureau sent Chen Kezhong and Zhang Yuzhe as representatives to participate. However, the meeting lasted only two days, and in addition to reading papers, there was no time to discuss other issues due to time constraints. After the Ministry of Education and the Compilation and Translation Bureau held a chemistry discussion meeting last year, they also wanted to organize other natural sciences. Therefore, it was decided to hold an astronomy and mathematics discussion meeting from April 1st to 6th, taking advantage of the spring break. Chen Kezhong, a member of the preparatory committee of the meeting, went to Beiping, Tianjin and other places to make contacts and returned to Beijing yesterday. According to him, Jiang Lifu of Nankai University is responsible for organizing mathematical terms (more than 5,000 items). This time, he contacted him to see that the work has been completed. Physics terms (more than 3,000 items) were previously reviewed by Sa Bendong and other members of the translation committee of the Beiping Physics Society, and have now been brought back. Astronomical terms (1,400 items) were organized by the Bureau and reviewed by the Terminology Review Committee and could have been published, but they will be submitted to the meeting again for further improvement. It is heard that the scope and purpose of this discussion meeting are: (1) Because the curriculum standards for mathematics and physics, etc., announced by the Ministry of Education only cover middle schools and not universities (after the chemistry discussion meeting last year, university chemistry curriculum standards were formulated but not yet announced), this discussion will focus on university astronomy and mathematics curriculum standards. (2) Because the mathematical and physical terms were not unified before, and astronomy is the first draft, after discussion, astronomical and mathematical terms can be passed to unify them. (3) The Ministry of Education has only announced curriculum standards for physics, but not instrument standards. This time, the minimum standards for instrument equipment can be stipulated, and it is hoped that they can be manufactured without relying on imported goods. It is heard that the Academia Sinica has made considerable preparations for manufacturing. (4) Current textbooks and reference books for senior and junior high schools and universities published outside are of poor quality and lack content. This time, efforts can be made to discuss and compile them to enrich the content. Recently, the Commercial Press has a draft of university subjects. If compilation standards are stipulated, it will be of great help to university textbooks. (5) Currently, physics research institutions are mostly focused on theory. If topics related to national defense can be taken as research, it will be more practical. The Ordnance Bureau will be asked to take responsibility for guidance in the future. It is heard that the meeting believes that academic thoughts in China often diverge, and students studying abroad have different opinions due to different study environments, so they advocate different things when they return to the country. Therefore, this discussion meeting will invite experts from various countries and representatives from various academic institutions to gather together, exchange opinions, and concentrate their efforts so that the research of astronomy and mathematics can occupy a place in the world in the future. The meeting yesterday continued to hire Zhu Gongjin of Shanghai Guanghua University and Xu Yingqi of Central University as members. Members from Guangdong and Wuhan have telegraphed that they will arrive on time. More than 20 proposals have been received from various places. The meeting location is set at the Overseas Chinese Guest House. Member registration will be before 7 pm on the 31st at the Ministry of Education. From April 1st, it will be at the Overseas Chinese Guest House. The meeting schedule is as follows: preparatory meeting on the morning of the 1st, group discussion in the afternoon, and public banquet by the Ministry of Education in the evening; holiday on the 2nd (Sunday); group discussion on the morning of the 3rd, general assembly and reports from all parties in the afternoon, and welcoming party by Central University in the evening; sightseeing on the morning of the 4th, group discussion in the afternoon, and welcoming party by Jinan University in the evening; group discussion on the morning of the 5th, academic visit in the afternoon, and public banquet by the Compilation and Translation Bureau in the evening; general assembly on the 6th.</p>

<p>Shanghai Esperanto Society</p>
<h3>Using Radio to Teach Esperanto</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Esperanto Society was initiated by Lu Shi-kai, Sheng Guocheng, Hu Yuzhi, and others, and was founded in 1908. It is the earliest Esperanto organization in China. Over the years, it has spared no effort in spreading Esperanto. It has an affiliated Esperanto Correspondence School, an Esperanto Bookstore, and the Green Light Magazine. After the January 28th Incident last year, the society was completely destroyed. However, Lu Sheng and others continued to work hard, and it has now been restored this spring. In addition to the correspondence school starting to enroll students, the bookstore and magazine are also actively progressing. Now, a contract has been signed with the Shanghai Broadcasting Radio Station to teach Esperanto via radio. Starting this week, every Monday and Saturday from 6:40 PM to 7:10 PM, the society will invite Mr. Tan and Mr. Liang to serve as Esperanto instructors. This Saturday, Mr. Li Weiyue, a Mandarin expert, will first give a lecture in Mandarin on the development of the Esperanto movement. Then, Mr. Chen Zhongxin, who represented the Ministry of Education and the Shanghai Esperanto Society at the World Esperanto Congress in Hungary in 1929, will give a speech in English on the importance of Esperanto. In the future, it is also planned to invite Lu Shi-kai, Sheng Guocheng, Hu Yuzhi, Chen Zhaoying, Sun Yizhi, Wang Luyan, and others to speak on the application and value of Esperanto in various fields. Mr. Tan's Esperanto textbook will be published in the "China Radio Magazine." Anyone who wants to learn Esperanto via radio can subscribe to it from the Yamei Company on Jiangxi Road in this city. They should also first provide their name, address, resume, and other information and send a letter to Shanghai Post Office Box 1332, Shanghai Esperanto Society, to register. No fees are required. This will allow the society to provide responsible answers and guidance if there are any difficulties in learning in the future.</p>

Among them, the most exciting was the battle between Fudan Shizhong and Hujiang. Both sides have outstanding talents and profound attainments. As a result, Fudan Shizhong defeated Hujiang 46-19. Watching Shizhong's performance, there is great hope of winning the championship of this year's secondary school athletic federation. Hujiang is the holder of last year's championship.

<h3>Japanese Sports Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Inviting Puppet State Athletes to Japan for Competition</p>
<p>Japan and the puppet state have recently been plotting collusion in sports. The Japan Sports Association had previously decided to hold a Japan-Manchuria confrontation at the former Northeast University in April of this year. This matter was reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that in addition to sending male athletes, Japan also plans to send a large number of female athletes along with them and perform various sports demonstrations. In addition, it is also planned to invite puppet state athletes to Japan for competition on the eighth day after the end of the confrontation. As for the athletes of the puppet state, most of them are famous athletes from the former Northeast University, Feng Yong University, and other places. When the Northeast fell, they did not have time to leave the customs.</p>

<p>Chinese Team Achieves Complete Victory in Doubles Last Night</p>
<p>…Chinese Team's Skills Greatly Improved, Hopeful for Winning the Championship Next Time</p>
<p>The second International Public Exhibition Cup handball competition was held at 6:00 PM last night with the doubles final. The Chinese first team, with Zhu Kuan and Sun Daosheng, faced the competition with great momentum and performed wonderfully. As a result, the Western team, Bu Jinshi and Malufu, found it difficult to parry, winning the first game 2-0. The second team's performance in the first round was inferior and was defeated. In the second round, Yan Zhaorong and Xu Changfa rallied their spirits and fought calmly, achieving victory. The third round was even more dangerous. In the end, the Western team failed by a difference of two points. The Hong brothers also won in the third team. The Western team forfeited in the fourth team, and Gao Ziai and Sun Baoqi won without effort. In the fifth team, Lu Mengting and Cheng Zhenhua tried hard to resist Yaoer and Garman, and calmly defeated the opponent. As a result, all five Chinese teams won. However, since the Western team had already won eight points yesterday, the Chinese team failed by one point in the overall result. The Public Exhibition Cup was retained by the Western team for another season. However, according to experts, the skills of each Chinese player have improved compared to before and are showing a tendency to surpass them. If they become more familiar with the location, they will definitely be able to win the championship next time. The only thing they are lacking now is physical strength. The nineteen doubles victories fully demonstrated their strengths. The results of the five teams last night are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhu Kuan 21|8 Bu Jinshi Sun Daosheng 21|18 Malufu</p>
<p>(2) Yan Zhaorong 2|21 Ke Li'ai 21|10 Xu Changfa 21|19 Ke Deng</p>

<h3>Serbian Farmers Nude to Ward Off Disaster</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>丨World Strange Ballads Five丨</p>
<p>The new moon is like a hook, illuminating farmhouses, a grand gathering in the countryside, open and unhidden; so that plagues do not invade, only nudity can drive away evil. Twelve men, flawless jade, twelve women, flawless jade; winning the approval of the elders, singing along the streets, the sound of "Yi Ya". "Note 1" Not wearing a thread to show purity, hands holding plows, forming a line; borrowing the gentle moonlight to illuminate the icy skin and snowy flesh. Snow for flesh, ice for hunger, night travel, how can there be madmen deceiving; even if encountering passersby, people must stand upright and respect them. Not allowed to make lewd jokes, not allowed to peep with greedy eyes; those who are disrespectful will not have effective spells, and plagues will grow like weeds. 丨 "Note 1" Such disaster relief is rare in the world, the Balkans have no such occurrence; Serbian farmers are superstitious, nude men and women sing and walk. Sing and walk, going back and forth, if the plague ghosts do not escape, what is the use? Plague ghosts avoid nudity like avoiding enemies, plague ghosts flee from nudity like fleeing from disaster; nude bodies are omnipotent, believe it, plague ghosts, do not linger. 丨 "Note 3"</p>
<p>"Note 1" Serbian farmers drive away the plague, often choosing twelve men and women in the village who are recognized as pure and flawless, and at the beginning of the new moon, parade naked around the village for a week.</p>
<p>"Note 2" During the parade, spectators are not allowed to say dirty words, and spectators are not allowed to peep at them with frivolous eyes, otherwise, they will not be able to ward off disaster, and perhaps the plague will become more serious.</p>
<p>"Note 3" The general meaning of the plague-expelling song is: "Plague ghosts, run fast! Plague ghosts, run fast! When you see our nude parade, you will not be able to stand firm."</p>
<h3>About "Hitting"</h3>
<p>— Xiaozhu</p>
<p>"Hitting" starts with the hand. When the ancients created the word, they clearly told us that "hitting" must be done with the hand. However, times have changed, and everything has evolved, so "hitting" has also taken on various different forms.</p>
<p>An old monk sits cross-legged on a futon without making a sound, which is called "dazuo" (打坐, meditating). When we are tired from work, we lie on the table and doze off for a moment, which is called "dadun" (打盹, napping). These two kinds of "hitting" are probably the most tranquil of all "hittings."</p>
<p>Monks and Taoists begging for food from door to door are commonly called "dazhai fan" (打齋飯, begging for alms): although it is actually no different from being a beggar, the name is ultimately more dignified.</p>
<p>Humorous speech, playful teasing, is called "dadun" (打諢, joking). Shanghainese also call it "dapeng" (打棚). Suing is called "daguan si" (打官司, litigating). "Daguan si" is when both parties go to court to argue, and the rich can hire lawyers to argue on their behalf. These two are "hitting" with the mouth. Literary men engage in polemics, which is called "dabi mo guan si" (打筆墨官司, literary lawsuit), where the weapon is writing.</p>
<p>Since our country has suffered national disasters, there has not been a day that we have not been hitting hard. Consider: Strictly ordering tranquility is also "hitting," learning the "dazuo" and "dadun" methods of hitting. Being busy with internal wars is of course "hitting." Begging the League of Nations is also "hitting," the same as "dazhai fan." Declaring resistance and filing protests are, needless to say, "hitting" with the mouth and writing. As for shouting to defend the territory with hot soup, and then taking the money and running away, this kind of hitting can only be classified as "dapeng."</p>
<p>Always hitting randomly will not produce a way out. Loyal and brave soldiers have long been fighting on the front lines. We, the people who are the rearguard, can no longer just shout "hitting" but should also take action: those with money, open your purses! Those with strength, take up arms and kill the enemy!</p>
<h3>The Night of the City</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shoutong</p>
<p>In the middle of the straight road, many bright streetlights hang, looking like a string of luminous pearls from a distance. The neon lights on both sides show off their charming colors, illuminating the platinum watches displayed in the glass windows, the colorful modern clothing materials, and all other youth supplies, making them even more adorable, and making the eyes of the passers-by involuntarily accept their attraction. Couples holding arms and strolling slowly stop and stare for a long time, the girl whispers with a slight smile, and they both walk into the store; so the items that are quietly waiting for people's love are very lucky to be held in her jade arm, or embraced in her arms, disappearing in an instant with the sound of leather shoes.</p>
<p>People who wander the streets and are used to a wandering life, some use the power of alcohol to numb their will and gain temporary comfort: some wear their hats tilted, put their hands in the middle of their trouser pockets, and keep chirping in their mouths, blowing out various tunes that are pleasing to their own ears: there are also those who hold newspapers in their hands and stand silently near the corner of the wall, watching the shadows of cars whizzing by like lightning. The impoverished children with pigeon-like faces follow behind the pedestrians, saying many kind words, hoping to get one or two copper coins; at the same time, they pay attention to the leftover cigarette butts discarded on the ground, frantically sucking on the various different flavors of Turkish, Egyptian, Fougeres, etc. Dear readers, you must deeply remember that here, we can recognize many who were once the glamorous predecessors of the past.</p>
<h3>Rose Thorns</h3>

<p>When Sun Wukong wreaked havoc in the Nantianmen, the Jade Emperor had thirty-three heavens to retreat layer by layer.</p>

<p>Emperor Yang of Sui stroked his neck and sighed, "What a good head, who will chop it off?" Matsuoka's mother taught her son forcefully, "If you don't win, don't see me."</p>
<p>Now Emperor Yang of Sui has long become a skeleton in the tomb, needless to say him, but I wonder what happened to Mr. Matsuoka's saber? I would very much like to widen my eyes and see who is more afraid of death, their loyal and filial subjects of the Yamato nation or our kings who lost their country?</p>

Even in European and American countries that are known as wealthy and powerful, there are still thousands upon thousands of friends without rice bowls looking for rice bowls. Naturally, it is even more difficult than ascending to the sky for us Chinese, who were born into a declining family, to find a rice bowl!</p>
<p>Indeed, we Chinese are smarter than any other nation. Japanese women are nonchalant about the issue of chastity, and what is called "taigai sho" (待合所) is the place where Japanese women wait for people to "match." Anyone who knows a little about the Japanese prostitution world knows that there is a term called "taigai sho." Chinese women, however, are unwilling to go openly to "taigai sho," but they do run to "meat shops" (肉莊). After all, the problem of eating is more important than the problem of sex. Therefore, many "dai fan dian" (待飯店, waiting for meal shops) have opened on the streets.</p>
<p>The term "dai fan dian" was created by yours truly. Suzhou people and Shanghai people call them "jien tou dian" (薦頭店, matchmaking shops). We can often see signs with white characters on a red background that say "Gusu Jin ×× Old Jientou Shop," "Weiyang Li ×× Old Jientou Shop," etc. on various roads; and next to them, their high-ranking neighbors, such as "Qingxu Taoist Temple," "Shangqing Palace," "Xuanxu Temple," "Bao Nian Xuan Juan" (pawnshops), "Kanetake Mototana" (Japanese businesses)... shine together to the left and right.</p>
<p>Because the owners of the matchmaking shops want to help women who have no food to eat, they invite this group of women who have no food to eat to display themselves in a small parlor: old and young; ugly and beautiful: big-headed and small ladies; chicken-skinned and crane-haired, grotesque-looking: all for the sake of not being able to find a rice bowl, they willingly display themselves here so that the boss or boss lady can choose them and obtain a rice bowl.</p>
<p>It is said that there is a lot of shady dealing in the matchmaking shops of Beijing and Tianjin, and they may be a disguised form of "taigai sho." The Shanghai area is very civilized, and everything may be kept as an open secret. Matchmaking shops are, of course, no exception. At the same time, I also have an idea, that is, in the whirlpool of unemployment for us men, why are there not a few benevolent gentlemen to start "Manager Jientou Shops," "Comprador Jientou Shops," "Principal Jientou Shops," "Committee Member Jientou Shops," "Official Jientou Shops"... so that everyone in the world can hold golden, carved, and jade-like rice bowls!</p>

<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Genshui</p>
<p>Second Episode: A Humble Abode Gains a Fragrant Neighbor; Secretly Admiring the Strong and Healthy Old Man; The Quan Family Chooses a Good Partner; Vigorously Criticizing the Poor Girl</p>
<p>Ji Zhi felt that what his brother said was a bit too heavy. He said, "I haven't done anything shameful either. I just send things to her house or bring things back." Houzhi said, "Why are you so diligent? Doesn't the family have servants to use? It's okay for you to go, but you even bring her here. The most important thing in doing things in society is making friends. As the saying goes, 'Those who are near vermilion are red, and those who are near ink are black.' You are always going back and forth with the old girl of the Yang family. What good can come of it? We cannot let such poor girls keep running into the house." Ji Zhi originally wanted to argue, but seeing his brother's very serious expression, he was holding a cigarette and just flicking the ash. If he contradicted his brother, his brother would really hit him. He had no choice but to stand straight in the courtyard. Houzhi said, "What do you intend to do? Do you have to put on this dress and show it to the old girl?" Ji Zhi looked at the situation and realized that he could not go out now, so he had to go back to his room. After about ten minutes, the maid shouted in the courtyard, "Second Master, dinner is ready." Ji Zhi had no choice but to take off the blue cloth gown he was wearing and walk to the main room. When he arrived in the main room, his brother, sister-in-law, and nephews were already sitting and eating. He sat at the bottom, slowly picked up his chopsticks, and ate with his head lowered. Madam Gan, sitting at the top, kept sizing him up. She asked, "Second Master, didn't you just make a new blue cloth gown?" Ji Zhi dared not say anything. Houzhi sneered and said, "I didn't expect that you've been with me for so many years, and you're still so unprogressive. That old girl, with her face painted red, runs around Haidian Street all day long. Everyone on these streets recognizes the old girl. Fortunately, she lives in the countryside. If she lived in Beijing, what would she become? Wouldn't she just be a social butterfly running around in the hutongs? It's not that I look down on poor people, but poverty must have ambition. I really don't approve of the way the old girl's family is poor. She sees that I'm the Director of the River Works Bureau and you're the Second Master, so she's especially fawning. She may pretend to be a young lady in front of you, but when you're not around, I think she's just telling people how good the Gan family is to her and how good Second Master Gan is to her, right?"

<h3>Metropolitan Café</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruoyi</p>
<p>It was clearly early spring weather, but the thermometer showed early summer heat. Girls with keen senses had changed into velvet shirts, and two natural rose blossoms revealed the red glow of Golden Delicious apples. Two lively crystal balls, covered by thick eyelashes, shot out unusual flames. The sight of wisps of hair fluttering in the spring breeze reminded me of the late poet Liu Dabai’s posthumous poem:</p>
<p>Spring breeze, why do you stir her temples?</p>
<p>Her temples are disheveled,</p>
<p>My heart is also disheveled.</p>
<p>Spring breeze, why do you stir my heart?</p>
<p>Spring breeze, my heart is moved,</p>
<p>Why do you remain unmoved?</p>
<p>Such oppressive weather</p>
<p>How can you keep me from falling into a deep sleep?</p>
<p>During the day, sitting in the small building facing the street, burying myself in writing, the monotonous and repetitive textual work made me feel dizzy and sleepy. The fleeting shadows of colorful clothing on the street disturbed my literary thoughts. I simply put down the goose quill pen, grabbed a cane, and went for a walk on Avenue Joffre, walking from two or three o'clock in the afternoon until dusk. My whole body felt comfortably warm, as soft as if immersed in the hot waves of a hot spring.</p>
<p>The sun has set, and it has already become a world of neon lights.</p>
<p>Pushing open the glass door more than two feet high, my nose smelled the aroma of chocolate and cream. Ascending the stairs, a phonograph stopped playing "Goodnight Vienna," welcoming me, a lone Khitan customer. I chose a window facing the road, lazily sat down to rest, and four heavily made-up White Russian waitresses, with pale faces and beautiful spring robes, were playing cards under the lights at a rectangular table.</p>
<p>My cane slipped to the floor, disturbing their tranquil atmosphere. The second waitress, with a face like an Eastern Madonna, came over and poured me a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The first waitress, who always had a smile, hadn't shown her face at this "Metropolitan Café" for a long time. Perhaps she had eloped with a White Russian clerk?</p>
<p>With the joy of Columbus discovering a new continent, I inadvertently saw a side profile reminiscent of Carmen, a Spanish cigarette factory girl. She was "new here." I was staring at the bright crabapple blossom tucked into her temples, and as if she noticed me peeking at her, she smiled charmingly. "Spring breeze, why do you stir my heart?"</p>
<p>I only gave her a look, and she swayed her slender waist, stepped out in a dancing gait, stood tall with her athletic figure, unleashed a pair of hungry torches, and asked me in broken French what I wanted.</p>
<p>"If you please, a glass of vodka."</p>
<p>"Vodka?"</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>She gave another charming and coquettish smile and went downstairs.</p>
<p>I waited for ten minutes, and she came upstairs empty-handed. I was wondering why she didn't bring the bottle and glasses. Her irregular French was heard again.</p>
<p>"Vodka is here!"</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Downstairs!"</p>
<p>"Downstairs? Do I have to go down?"</p>
<p>I got up with curiosity, and she accompanied me downstairs. A strong perfume mixed with the unique body odor of Western women, smelled like the irritant scent of gasoline. When I reached the candy shop downstairs, she pointed to a chauffeured car parked outside the glass door, and I woke up as if from a dream. Ah! It turned out that the clever-faced but slow-witted White Russian waitress had mistaken "vodka" for "motorcar"!</p>
<p>I pretended nothing had happened, paid for the coffee at the counter, and calmly walked into the car seat. I told the driver to drive around Avenue Joffre inexplicably before returning to my small Silver Leaf building, less than three hundred steps from the "Metropolitan Café."</p>
<p>Spring breeze! Why do you repeatedly make a fool of people?</p>

<h3>"The Doctrine of the Mean"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yunping</p>
<p>Originally, finding a "Doctrine of the Mean" that is neither left nor right is a very difficult thing. However, clever Chinese people are accustomed to finding this path. For example, when something happens, if you ask for other people's opinions, the answer is sure to be neither this way nor that way, looking around blankly, without touching the edge. They are exactly standing in the middle of "this way" and "that way." Also, if you ask: Should China declare war on Japan? Should lost territories be recovered by force? The answer is sure to be: Of course... However... The conversation turns, smoothly sliding, and the conclusion is naturally unity and solidarity against foreign aggression! Should war be declared? Should war not be declared? Only "heaven knows."</p>
<p>However, if war is really declared, and the outcome is victory, naturally they are meritorious figures who advocated for war. If the outcome is unfortunately a failure, they are also foreseers, because they had already said, however... [We] should have carefully considered and prudently planned, leading to today's unfortunate result and fruit.</p>
<p>My god, what a stable path this is!</p>
<p>In reality, in this day and age, expressing one's own opinion is also a very difficult thing. For example, with political views, if you are a little right-leaning, although you may earn the title of "moderate" from some people, you are also inevitably scolded as outdated and corrupt! Conversely, if you are a little left-leaning, although you may earn the title of "progressive" from some people, you are also inevitably accused of being reactionary and degenerate! Only by standing on the "Doctrine of the Mean," neither left nor right, shaking your head at the new faction, sighing at the old faction, and having both "moderation" and "progress," can you naturally be adaptable and successful everywhere.</p>
<p>The so-called "Doctrine of the Mean," in other words, is "fence-sitting." But there is probably no one with legs long enough to straddle a wall with both feet firmly on the ground, right? Friends who straddle the wall, if they are not careful and fall over, who can guarantee that they will not break an arm or leg and be covered in blood?</p>

<h3>In the Mill</h3>
<p>— Qiu Peng</p>
<p>The mill was filled with darkness and dampness.</p>
<p>The mule, wearing blinders, walked around the heavy stone mill incessantly. An arched wooden frame was tightly fastened to its back, and two iron chains connected the frame to the mill handle, causing the heavy stone mill to rotate with its progress. The mule driver's whip fell on the mule's back like raindrops from time to time. In the mule's world, there was no light, no lively sounds or colors: all it felt were two eternally unchanging, gloomy, and terrifying sounds: the grinding sound of the stone mill and the mule driver's rough shouts.</p>
<p>As days went by, it felt tired. It felt that the stone mill behind it was getting heavier day by day, and the wooden frame fastened to its back was getting tighter day by day. It just slowed down a bit, wanting to stop and rest, but immediately, it heard an angry roar, and a heavy whip fell on its body.</p>
<p>Sweating and panting, it continued to move forward. It wanted to break free from the blinders, break free from the shackle-like wooden frame, and leap into another bright world to gain freedom and happiness. But the heavy stone mill oppressed it too much. It was tired, weak, and had no strength to struggle or resist. It had to continue forward, sadly moaning in despair.</p>
<p>It went around and around, one day after another. The wooden frame tightly fastened to its back had worn a hole in its spine, and bright red blood flowed silently. The muscles all over its body contracted day by day, and its four strong legs now moved as weakly as four fragile blades of grass... Finally, one day, under violent shouts and raindrop-like whippings, it suddenly felt a burst of colors before its eyes, and then its limbs uncontrollably buckled and it fell to the ground.</p>
<p>It was dreaming at that moment. It seemed to have turned into a pug with beautiful curly hair, nestled in the arms of a noblewoman, so warm and sweet...</p>
<h3>Parisian Jottings</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shijun, from Paris</p>
<p>(7) Maeterlinck's Tragicomedy (Continued)</p>
<p>In a love lawsuit, those involved are unclear, so bystanders have no way to intervene. What we know is that Madame Leblanc was originally a woman full of passion. She greatly admired Rousseau, and whenever she read the history of geniuses of all eras, she wanted to become the wife of that genius. She herself said that, based on her interests and nature, she should not be someone's wife. The first thought when she lived with Maeterlinck was to make Maeterlinck happy. As long as Maeterlinck was happy, even if it meant sacrificing her own happiness, she was willing. Because she loved Maeterlinck more than she loved herself. She knew very well that people of genius were not easy to approach, but she believed that she had the strength to resist the storms of genius. Originally, she herself was also a clever and unrestrained person. In addition to singing, she could write poetry and short essays, and she was also good at writing and speaking English. When she was seventeen, she performed in Paris and rented a house. Her house was like a train station. Countless artists without a place to live or eat would come to her. She took in piano teachers who couldn't afford pianos, painters who couldn't afford canvases, singers who couldn't find work, and writers who couldn't find publishers, etc.</p>
<p>In her "Memoirs," many places naturally contain thorough attacks on Maeterlinck. Even trivial matters are used as attack material. Maeterlinck originally had a deep sympathy for small animals. But in the first chapter of her "Memoirs," she said that Maeterlinck liked dogs the most and hated cats the most. Maeterlinck had told her that cats were the most unchaste creatures. She was very surprised that Maeterlinck believed this kind of rumor. Later, when they lived together, Maeterlinck actually shot and killed her favorite cat with a pistol. Because one day the cat was meowing very loudly in the garden, Maeterlinck got tired of listening to it and opened the window to say to her, "I want to kill it." She thought he was joking; then, with a crash, the bullet hit the cat right in the eye. The cat lay on the ground, but its eyes were still fixed on them. Harry, in "Maeterlinck's Life and Work," said that it was hard for him to believe that such cruelty came from Maeterlinck. Anyone who has read Maeterlinck's "The Intelligence of Flowers" and essays on the lives of bees or termites knows that Maeterlinck has a deep love for all kinds of tiny plants and animals. He cited an incident as evidence of refutation: once he and Maeterlinck went to a place and saw a cat tied to a cannon's muzzle by a mischievous person. The cat was struggling desperately, trying to bite through the rope and escape. Maeterlinck hurried over, took out a paper cutter from his pocket, and cut the rope. The cat jumped over Maeterlinck's head, claws scratching a scar on Maeterlinck's forehead, nearly injuring Maeterlinck's eyes. But Maeterlinck didn't care. This shows how much Maeterlinck loved small animals.</p>
<p>There are also some places in the "Memoirs" that are not easy to confirm. She accused Maeterlinck of stealing her ideas for his articles and not writing her name. One day, when it was very hot, they both knelt under a pine tree to look at an ant nest. Maeterlinck played pranks on the ants with a stick. She couldn't help but question Maeterlinck why, in "The Treasure of the Humble," he often quoted her words, only saying that an old philosopher said it, or an old friend said it, or simply using quotation marks. Maeterlinck raised his head and answered in surprise: "Writing your name would be ridiculous. You are an actress, you are a singer, people won't believe me." Maeterlinck's "Wisdom and Destiny," according to her, Maeterlinck himself admitted plagiarizing her ideas. In 1898, when the book was about to be published, her brother advised Maeterlinck to write both names, but Maeterlinck thought it would be better to write a dedication to Madame Leblanc in the front of the book. But this dedication was deleted in the new version of 1926. Madame Leblanc strongly disapproved. She said that even if the love between the two was gone, or if they now hated the previous love, the dedication should not be deleted.</p>
<p>Now, let me briefly describe Maeterlinck's background and his place in the history of drama. Maeterlinck was born in Ghent, Belgium, on August 29, 1862. He studied at the Saint Barbe Middle School in his youth and was fond of literature. Later, in accordance with his parents' wishes, he studied law at the University of Ghent. In 1886, he formally practiced as a lawyer. In that year, he went to Paris and inadvertently met several famous Symbolist poets. The one who impressed him most was Verlaine. He and several friends listened to Verlaine's talks on literature and art in a coffee shop, sometimes returning to the hotel only when dawn broke. This strengthened his literary ambitions, and his works began to move in the direction of emotional, symbolic, and mysterious aspects. His first collection of poems, "Greenhouses," published in 1889, is a collection of lyric poems symbolizing human fragility. The following year, he published his second play, "Princess Maleine." Mirbeau praised him as the Belgian Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Originally, naturalism dominated the modern stage. For example, the works of Ibsen, Strindberg, and Dumas fils were all the rage. It was not until around 1890 that the movement of neo-romantic drama emerged. Although this movement differed in the forms it expressed due to the different personalities of writers in various countries, their fundamental spirit all placed emphasis on things beyond sensory experience, striving to clarify the true nature of life, emphasizing emotion over reason, emphasizing the soul over matter, and emphasizing the subjective over the objective. Maeterlinck belongs to the giants of the neo-romantic school. Although some people doubt that he will occupy such a prominent position in the history of drama a century from now, he has his unshakable position, which I think no one can deny. Maeterlinck is a poet of drama and a thinker at the same time. His collections of essays, such as "The Treasure of the Humble," "Wisdom and Destiny," "The Life of the Bee," "The Buried Temple," "The Double Garden," "The Intelligence of Flowers," "Death," "The Wrack of the Storm," "The Guest," "The Blue Lanes," and "The Life of the Termite," fully display his face as a thinker.

<h3>The Crossroads of Time and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>"Old Cao told you, didn't he?"</p>
<p>"………………………………………………"</p>
<p>She just smiled and said nothing.</p>
<p>"Yesterday I accompanied one of my relatives to the park to meet her, and Old Cao saw it and started spreading rumors..."</p>
<p>"Whether it's true or false, anyway, Mr. Lin is such a good person. [You] can't win him over, and you're not qualified to win him over either."</p>
<p>She said, lowering her head and smiling.</p>
<p>Haiquan thought, what is she saying? This is not a place to stay for long. This is only the second time he's met her, but she's acting so familiar, as if they've been friends for years. In any case, her attitude towards him is inappropriate.</p>
<p>"Old Cao hasn't returned yet, I have to go. I'll come see you again this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, do you dislike me that much? Shiguang isn't home, so am I not qualified to represent him? Mr. Lin really looks down on people!"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Cao..."</p>
<p>"I don't like you calling me that!...</p>
<p>She didn't wait for him to finish speaking, acting unhappy in a coquettish manner. The child she was holding was originally sucking on her right breast, but now she exposed her left breast as well, completely revealing both breasts. Haiquan was originally looking at her as he spoke. He didn't expect her to have such a demonstration, feeling threatened, and dared not look up.</p>
<p>"Then, what should I call you?"</p>
<p>"In short, I don't like you calling me by such an old-fashioned name!"</p>
<p>"Then, is it okay to call you sister-in-law?"</p>
<p>He asked with a smile, while also忍不住 wanting to steal a glance at her exposed full chest.</p>
<p>In just a moment, he secretly blamed himself and quickly turned to the other side.</p>
<p>"That's fine. You'd better call me by my name. We're all friends."</p>
<p>"I don't know your name."</p>
<p>"My surname is Hua, and my given name is Qiuying. You can just call me Qiuying."</p>
<p>"How dare I..."</p>
<p>Their eyes met. She gave him another charming smile.</p>
<p>At this moment, Haiquan realized his own lack of progress. He thought how weak his soul was! According to his own subjective classification, among the many women he knew, Peizhu was of course the first, 丨丨 the most chaste woman. Her sister Peizhen was the second, 丨丨 but she had one flaw: she had gone to the dance hall with that giant. Zhuo Shuhua was the third. Mrs. Hezi was the fourth. As for this Mrs. Cao Shiguang, she was the worst. According to Haiquan's usual advocacy of the ideal female classification method, although it had a bit of subjective or feudalistic evaluation, there was nothing to be done. A noble woman is always superior to a general woman. However, on the other hand, he felt that the allure of women was exactly the opposite of his ideal. If classified by the degree of charm in capturing men, then the above order would be reversed. He now discovered his own contradiction. He seemed to have only admiration and longing for Peizhu, and lacked thoughts of love and desire. But for women like Mrs. Hezi and Hua Qiuying, he only felt their charm was unusually strong, easily inciting him, and he pursued them for carnal pleasures. Finally, he reached a conclusion, which is that it is most ideal to have a woman like Peizhu as a formal wife and have a simple love and desire relationship with a woman like Mrs. Hezi. This is not Haiquan's original idea, but rather something advocated by the French socialist Fourier.</p>

<h3>Speculation in Gold Rises Again</h3>
<p>Tight Exchange Rates Increase Extra Charges on Transactions</p>
<p>Result Exceeds Previous Day by 0.07 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market has been unpredictable recently. After falling the day before yesterday, it rebounded yesterday, the speed of which was truly unexpected. Initially, due to foreign telegrams indicating that both near-term and long-term London silver bars rose by 0.25, the British-American exchange rate increased by 0.125, the American-British rate rose by 1 point, and the New York silver price increased by 0.0625, the market was quite satisfied. However, the long-term silver price fell by more than 0.06%, and private telegrams from banks also showed a slight decrease of 0.05%. Although American cotton rose by 9 points, it was ignored, and market sentiment improved. The opening price immediately rose to 1071.5 yuan. The exchange market opened slightly tight, but because the July US dollar rate was 30.1875 yuan, negotiations were underway, so the gold price fluctuated around 70 yuan. When the HSBC exchange rate was announced, the shilling remained unchanged, but the US dollar increased by 0.125, and the exchange market slightly declined to 1067.1 yuan. However, after this small fluctuation, it gradually rose. The July US dollar rate, which had been 30.25 yuan, moved to 30.1875 yuan, returning to above 70 yuan. When Mercantile Bank tried to secure the July US dollar at 30.125 yuan, it was difficult to settle, pushing the price up to 6.3 yuan. When Banque Belge offered the July US dollar at 30 yuan, the market turned around. However, as Banque Belge continued to secure the July US dollar at 30.1875 yuan, many others followed suit, causing the price to fall to 1.5 yuan. It was still able to rise to 1075.3 yuan at the noon close. The afternoon market opened at 1073.9 yuan, retreating to 3.8 yuan. Mitsui secured the July US dollar at 30.125 yuan, and Mercantile Bank took 0.0625, pushing the price above 80 yuan. Mitsui further secured 30.9375 yuan for the same month, reaching 1083.2 yuan. Telegrams from Bombay reported a rise of two annas, leading to a downturn in the market, falling below 80 yuan. Mercantile Bank was still trying to secure the July US dollar at 30 yuan. At this point, the market could still struggle. However, when Zhejiang Bank offered the June US dollar at 30.75 yuan, the market could no longer sustain itself, retreating to 77.3 yuan. Finally, Mitsui again secured the July US dollar at 30 yuan, leading to a rebound, so the closing price was 1080 yuan, with the base price increasing by 38 yuan. The difference between four- and five-month swap rates was 0.8 yuan. The market situation for the day is detailed below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1071.5 yuan, a rise of 12.2 yuan compared to the previous close. The exchange market was tight, but not significantly. The initial asking price for immediate delivery of British exchange was 1 shilling, 8 pence and 0.5625, and for US exchange, 29.375 yuan. Brokers initially offered the July US dollar at 30.125 yuan for 1.8 yuan, but because banks were willing to offer at this price, Bingxing Yuanheng sold, causing the price to fall to 69 yuan. Zhifeng, Yongtong, Fengheng all bought, pushing the price up to 72 yuan. The July US dollar at 30.1875 yuan was difficult to sell. Qingfa, Yongheng, Yuzhaofeng, Changyifeng, and Yongjun all tried to unload, but the price remained below 70 yuan. Mercantile Bank secured the July British exchange at 30.1875 yuan, and Fushun moved to above 70 yuan. Daxing Yongfu Yu also negotiated, further increasing to 72.4 yuan. HSBC offered the June US dollar at 30.9375 yuan, and Zhaofeng Chang took the opportunity to sell high, leading to a downstream trend. Yifeng Yong also sold, further retreating to below 69 yuan. Zhongfu bought the July US dollar at 30.25 yuan, causing the price to hover around 70 yuan. Mercantile Bank sold the March British exchange at 30.4375 yuan, and Qian Changxiang also sold at 8 yuan. When the HSBC exchange rates were announced, the shilling remained unchanged, but the US dollar increased by 0.125, causing market panic. HSBC further offered the June US dollar at 30.9375 yuan, and Qingfa Yong Yifeng Yong took the opportunity to sell, causing the price to fall to 67.1 yuan. Banque Belge offered the July US dollar at 30.3125 yuan, but because Daxing Yong had a limited order to buy, the price gradually rose. Hengyu also bought, and Mercantile Bank secured the July US dollar at 30.25 yuan, pushing the price above 70 yuan, to 0.4 yuan. The asking price for goods retreated to below 9 yuan. Ruixing then came to buy, and banks wanted to secure the July US dollar at 30.25 yuan, pushing the price above 70 yuan. Zhengjin then secured the July US dollar at 30.1875 yuan, and Hengyu smoothly bought, pushing the price up to above 71 yuan. Dadecheng bought at above 2 yuan. After this, the exchange market was very good. Mercantile Bank then secured the July US dollar at 30.125 yuan, and Ruixing continued to secure, Hengyu also bought, pushing the price up to above 4 yuan. Because the May US exchange at 30.625 yuan was difficult to settle, Yifeng Yong Hengyu and others also bought. At this time, the price of the July US dollar at 30.125 yuan was difficult to settle, so it was set at 1076.3 yuan.

<h3>Public Bonds Change Three Times a Day</h3>
<p>In the End, Most Saw Increases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of public bonds on the Chinese Securities Exchange remained firm. Market rumors had subsided, and there were signs of a ceasefire in the front-line war. There was also demand from the northern faction. Initially, there were scattered short coverings that led to increases, then bulls unloaded, leading to decreases, and finally there was new news that led to firmness. The delivery deadline for this month is approaching, and bulls without actual strength and bears without actual goods must settle within this period. Therefore, there were more transactions this month, and prices rose and fell according to the different supply and demand from bulls and bears. In the morning, during the opening and closing of the two trading sessions, scattered short coverings led to increases of 0.3 or 0.4 jiao each session, and market sentiment was quite firm. In the afternoon, bulls of the 32nd and 38th issues unloaded, and there was a sudden drop of 0.5 or 0.6 jiao in one session, and market sentiment suddenly became weak.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Driven Up by Rumors</h3>
<p>There is Talk of Yarn Mills Reducing Production</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, as American cotton has risen slightly, leading to optimistic market sentiment. However, actual demand remains sluggish. It is found that only over 240 bales were bought by various parties throughout the day, and the current sluggish sales are rarely seen in the past. Based on actual measurements, the market is still difficult to stabilize. However, there are also groundless rumors in the business community, saying that yarn mills are planning to reduce production. However, various factories have not taken any action, it is said.</p>

<p>Guangdong 60 Fujian 5 Xiamen 15 Hankou 5</p>
<h3>Cotton Bulls Hold Tight</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firm because American cotton has increased, and buyers have no intention of releasing their positions. Therefore, the market situation is tight. However, the yarn market is quite weak, and the factories' attitudes are flat. Recently, spot cotton business has moved slightly, but prices are flat, and there are more sources of supply from various regions. In general, the cotton market is unlikely to have a large-scale price increase.</p>

<h3>This Month's Flour Futures Increase by 0.06</h3>
<p>April Futures Decline by 0.025</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market also quoted prices based on foreign wheat. Chicago wheat rose by about 0.02 or 0.03, so the asking prices for flour in each month seemed slightly stable. However, because business with customer groups was suspended, transactions could not be expanded, and the market was ultimately lifeless. By the afternoon, the market had returned, and because this month's flour was close to the delivery date, customer groups were issuing orders, and the 0.06 barrier had been broken, falling to as low as 1.7 qian and 0.055. However, short positions at small factories were still being covered. Large factories were issuing documents for far-term months, and the numbers were considerable. However, buyers ultimately found it difficult, and issuing was not easy. As a result, this month's price was 0.005 lower than the previous day, April was up by 0.025, May, June, and July were unchanged, and August was down by 0.025, it is said.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Foreign Wheat Have Already Been Loaded</h3>
<p>There Will Definitely Be More Hedging in the Future… Chicago Wheat Asking Price Up by 0.03</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of trading for each month's wheat contracts in the morning and afternoon, the market remained in a fluctuating state. Prices then quoted based on foreign wheat, rebounding by 0.02 or 0.03, and market sentiment returned to stability. However, large quantities of foreign wheat have been loaded in recent days, and factories and firms are busy unloading. If there is an opportunity, hedging transactions on the exchange should increase. There have been no recent quotes for Australian wheat. Canadian wheat increased by 0.03 due to the rebound in the gold price, to 3.53. Factories have not made any transactions. As a result, this month's price was down by 0.01, and there were no other changes, it is said.</p>
<h3>Arrivals of Xiang, Gan, and Wan Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Outbound shipments still mostly from the Ningbo Guild</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for customer xian rice were sparsely seen. Arrivals included 5,000 bags of Hunan rice loaded by two rounds of ships from the Changan Public Company, mainly grain xian rice, with a small amount of rough rice and round rice attached. Additionally, nearly 1,000 bags of Wuhu round rice arrived via the Datong ship, with the rice type being "Wubu Bianyuan Chong Wuji Yuan." The market was lively due to the arrivals, showing a buoyant trend. However, the Fujian Guild broker became active again yesterday, purchasing over two thousand bags in the market. With continued demand, the market was supported. However, the Jiangxi machine rice, arriving sooner or later with ample stock, saw sluggish sales and remained weak. Subsequently, the Ningbo Guild broker purchased three hundred bags of early Jiangxi machine rice at a price of only 7.06 yuan. Early machine rice has been without transactions for a while, and the offered price showed a significant drop of 0.29 yuan compared to the market price of 7.35 yuan last week. Over six hundred bags of Hunan machine red rice opened at prices ranging from 8.40 yuan to 8.27 yuan, also showing a slight decrease of 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. The rest remained stable. The breakdown includes 155 bags of Hunan Mao Red at a price of 7.85 yuan, 500 bags of Rough Red at a price of 7.85 yuan, 50 bags of Machine Yuan at a price of 9.21 yuan, and 500 bags of Chong Wuhu Machine Yuan rice at a price of 9.82 yuan. The main product of this street remained the Hejian car xian rice, with only 100 bags of Nanjing Ma xian rice purchased yesterday at a price of 7.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sesame Trends Gradually Lively</h3>
<p>Raw Peanuts High, Prices Flat</p>
<p>The sesame market atmosphere is gradually improving. With the Shaoxing Guild broker's demand continuing, interest on this street is also strong. Moreover, foreign firms are willing to buy at the original prices, so most merchants are actively trading, presenting a fairly stable market. Yesterday, over two hundred bags of Dangshan white sesame were traded on this street at a price of 7.02 liang. Over three hundred bags of Zhangbaling white sesame were sold to foreign firms at prices ranging from 7.7 to 7.6 liang. Additionally, over three hundred and seventy bags of yellow sesame were sold as oil material to the Shaoxing Guild at prices of 6.48 liang for Yuanzhou sesame and 6.85 to 6.5 liang for Central China sesame. Transactions of raw peanuts were sluggish. High-quality goods were rare, maintaining flat prices. However, reports of slightly lower production prices have inevitably softened market sentiment.</p>
<h3>Over Three Thousand Loads of Silk, Tea, Silk Cocoon Waste Accumulated</h3>
<p>Thirty-Five Pieces of Newly Arrived Wuxi Factory Silk</p>
<p>Silk cocoon waste is generally superior to Japanese goods. Japan has been diligently improving and competitively selling at low prices in European and American markets. Furthermore, due to global economic instability, European sales are increasingly stagnant. Shanghai warehouses have accumulated over three thousand seven hundred loads of goods from previous years, including kerchiefs, wristbands, handles, rope ends, small strips, and long and short silk waste, moth-eaten cocoon clothing, stagnant double palace pierced head rotten cocoons.</p>
<p>Currently, fewer than ten silk reeling factories in Wuxi are in operation, further reducing silk production. However, there is still a large inventory. As the end of this month approaches rapidly, factories are urgently releasing March futures silk for delivery in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai-Wuxi express train arrived with thirty-five pieces of factory silk bearing the Jinshuang Yue Tu Xishan brands, in preparation for delivery to foreign firms at the end of the month.</p>

The losses suffered by Chinese merchants are estimated to be over 40 liang per load.</p>

<h3>US Preparing to Lift Gold Embargo</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance to Issue Announcement Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Has Attracted Significant Attention from the Financial Community</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, 24th: Secretary of the Treasury Woodin told reporters today that an announcement regarding the gold embargo is currently being prepared and may be released tomorrow. Woodin did not indicate the content of the announcement. When asked whether the announcement would lift the gold embargo, Woodin replied that he thought it would. There are various rumors circulating in New York's financial community that the authorities have lifted the gold embargo and that it will be announced within days. However, the New York financial community expressed doubt about the possibility of allowing unlimited exports of cash. If such a ban were completely lifted, there would be no way to estimate how much gold would be exported, as the amount of cash held by foreign central banks in the United States is very large, as is the amount of US bonds held by foreigners. Furthermore, it would not be difficult for domestic residents to export gold if they wished, as they only need to contact foreign merchants and have them withdraw cash on their behalf. The Secretary of the Treasury's statement to reporters has attracted significant attention on Wall Street. The financial community is eagerly awaiting the announcement that may be released tomorrow. According to some sources, cash exports to settle real commercial debts may be permitted, but subject to strict licensing procedures.</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, 24th: Senators who support maintaining the silver market anticipate that President Roosevelt will be sympathetic to their cause and are now preparing to relaunch their campaign to restore the price of silver. Senator King will request the White House in the next few days that the US delegation to the World Economic Conference include at least three representatives with ties to silver. Senator Wheeler told guests that he will soon begin a movement in the Senate to pass a silver bill with a 16-to-1 ratio. He believes that a bill to stabilize the price of silver can be passed in this congressional session, which he considers the most appropriate time to pass silver legislation.</p>
<h3>US Navy's Eight-Year Plan</h3>
<p>Increase Navy Aircraft by Nine Hundred</p>
<p>Preparing for Operations Against Japan in the Pacific</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of March 19th, the Roosevelt administration is focusing on two major issues: strengthening national defense and the navy. Advocates of a strong navy, Swanson and Roosevelt, are working together to prepare an eight-year plan. The contents of the plan are as follows: (1) Construction of two 20,000-ton-class aircraft carriers, (2) Construction of eight cruiser gunboats, (3) Construction of nine hundred naval aircraft. This grand naval plan suggests preparations for operations in the Far East. The increase in aircraft to nine hundred doubles the current naval strength. If the US Navy meets the quotas stipulated in the London Treaty, it will have 133,000 tons and eighty-four destroyers and 40,000 tons and thirty submarines. Since proponents of a strong navy have revealed the US Navy's weaknesses, it has triggered a public outcry. Furthermore, Vincent, the chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, also proposed a ten-year plan in the previous Congress, but funding is still pending approval in the coming year. According to Vincent's original ten-year plan, 63 million yuan would be spent annually, but now that it has been shortened by two years, the annual amount should be increased. One of the real intentions behind the US strengthening its navy is to create room for maneuver in the next arms reduction talks, and the other is to strengthen national defense to take action in the Far East.</p>
<p>Gu Asks the League of Nations</p>
<h3>To Pay Attention to Japanese Invasion of Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Secretariat Has Notified All Member States</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Secretariat of the League of Nations notified all member states of a letter from Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun, containing three points: (1) The day after the General Assembly passed the report on February 24, Japanese forces launched a general offensive and occupied Jehol. Japanese forces are currently continuing military operations along the Great Wall. Because the Chinese army's resistance is effective, Japanese forces are preparing to invade Tianjin and other parts of North China, hoping to undermine the Chinese army's resistance from the rear. (2) According to the latest statement from the Chinese government, Japanese forces are taking actions and preparing to invade North China (this section mentions the actions of Japanese warships, etc.). (3) A Japanese artillery officer was found to be carrying a map of the future "Manchukuo" that included Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, and other places within "Manchukuo." (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke</p>
<h3>Good at Speaking Polite Words</h3>
<p>Says Japan Does Not Want to Ask Anyone for Help</p>
<p>(New York) Matsuoka, the chief delegate representing Japan at the League of Nations, arrived here today and told visitors that Japan does not ask for help from anyone because Japan is fundamentally not a vassal state of the United States or any other country. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(New York) When Japanese representative Matsuoka arrived in port, over two thousand Chinese people gathered at the pier, but were unable to hold a demonstration due to special police precautions. One Chinese man was arrested after a loaded pistol was found on him. Matsuoka declared that Japan is not a vassal state and does not need to appeal to any country. If the United States withdraws its Pacific Fleet, then Japanese-American relations can be expected to improve. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke arrived in New York yesterday. According to the Dongbao, the US Secretary of the Navy welcomed Matsuoka to discuss all issues related to the Navy, and he is willing to consult with Japan on the issue of the naval strength ratio between the two countries after 1935. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has continuously adopted provocative policies towards the US Navy, while the United States has responded with careful consideration and deep friendship. However, the Japanese Navy is deeply concerned that the friendly attitude of the United States may force the Japanese Navy to reduce its size, so Matsuoka has consistently adopted a negative attitude towards the issue of disarmament.

<p>General Disarmament Commission</p>
<h3>Debate on the New British Plan</h3>
<p>Small Entente Expresses Acceptance</p>
<p>Japan Will Declare Four Points of Opposition</p>
<p>Reuters London, 24th: British Foreign Secretary Simon flew from London to Geneva today to participate in the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference's discussion of the draft treaty proposed by the British Prime Minister last week. Due to slight delays along the way between Lyon and Geneva, Simon did not arrive at the venue until after the meeting had begun. Representatives from the Small Entente, led by Titulescu, began the debate on the treaty, stating that the three Small Entente countries he represents are prepared to accept the British proposal as a basis for discussion but reserve the right to propose amendments later. Swiss representative Motta also held the same attitude, stating that the British Prime Minister's plan has preserved the Disarmament Conference. Representatives from Norway, Turkey, and other countries spoke in succession, raising many criticisms regarding certain articles in the proposed treaty. Norwegian representative Lange stated that budgetary restrictions, arms manufacturing monitoring, the definition of aggression, and punishments for aggressor countries should all be included, but it is regrettable that this treaty does not mention them at all. Tomorrow, there will be further debate, and the debate will likely conclude on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Havas Geneva, 24th: At yesterday's meeting of the General Disarmament Commission, the Turkish representative spoke, requesting that the principle of equality of armaments be extended to the demilitarized zone of the Bosphorus Strait, adding a new element to the discussion.</p>
<p>(Note: The Treaty of Lausanne, signed by Turkey and the Great Powers in 1922, stipulated that demilitarized zones be established on both sides of the Bosphorus Strait and the Dardanelles Strait, as well as on certain islands.)</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, 25th: Instructions will be sent to the Japanese representative in Geneva, stating the Japanese government's attitude towards the British disarmament plan. The statement reportedly includes: (1) Cannot recognize those who violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact as de facto aggressors. (2) Cannot recognize the plan regarding land force restrictions because the military strength of Japan's neighbors, China and Russia, is currently unknown. (3) Cannot recognize the naval restriction proposals; the attitude will be determined after the proposal submitted by Japan on December 10 of last year is discussed. (4) Cannot recognize the air force restriction plan because Japan's aviation affairs development is still relatively backward.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American War Debt Negotiations</h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 24th. British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, met with Secretary of the Treasury Hull for a long time today. Formal negotiations on the Anglo-American war debt issue have begun. After the talks, Hull declared that today's conversation was merely an exchange of opinions, and no decisions were made. During the conversation, in addition to discussing war debts, they also thoroughly reviewed international and commercial relations that should be discussed at the future World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 24th. It is generally believed that the British Ambassador Lindsay's meeting with Secretary of State Hull was at the behest of the British government. Due to conflicting information recently received, the British government wanted to ascertain President Roosevelt's views on the war debt issue. It is speculated that Hull may have mentioned the issue of abolishing tariff barriers to Lindsay, stating that tariffs that "prohibit the import of foreign goods" are sufficient to hinder international commerce. Therefore, the primary issue at present is to abolish such tariffs. It is generally believed that if this issue can be resolved first, it will have a positive impact on war debts.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 24th. When Secretary of State Hull spoke with British Ambassador Lindsay today, Hull mentioned the issue of reducing tariffs in the same breath as the war debt issue. This shows that when discussing debt issues with European debtor nations in the future, the United States is willing to consider all requests to modify war debts, provided that the debtor nations agree to lower tariffs and ensure the success of the World Economic Conference.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister's Diplomatic Remarks</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Offer Much Criticism</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 24th. British Prime Minister MacDonald today stated in the House of Commons the results of his trip to Geneva, Rome, and Paris. French newspapers have been very critical of MacDonald's remarks. For example, the Paris Echo stated that encouraging retaliation will only encourage the dictatorships of Hitler and Mussolini to run rampant. French newspapers are deeply concerned that the steps taken by Britain and Italy will lead to a revision of the peace treaty. French newspapers insist that France is not yet prepared for this. British Conservative Party member Churchill's argument that foreign affairs should be handled by ordinary diplomatic organs is in opposition to MacDonald's continental negotiations, which France has praised greatly.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 24th. German political circles commented on British Prime Minister MacDonald's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, calling it "very calm," which proves that France has rejected the four-power pact proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Political observers, after carefully reading MacDonald's speech, felt that its tone was very different from the optimism MacDonald expressed in Rome.</p>
<p>Havas, Yugoslavia Capital, 24th. British Prime Minister MacDonald's speech to the House of Commons yesterday has greatly shocked people here. It is generally said that as far as the Little Entente countries are concerned, there is no such thing as revising treaties, and Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant guarantees the territorial integrity of the signatory countries. It is also said that MacDonald's declarations in Rome, Paris, and London are quite different. People hope that he can clearly state MacDonald's true intentions to avoid public confusion.</p>

Wang said that there has been no fierce fighting on the front line in recent days, but the Japanese are reinforcing and preparing to launch a large-scale attack. He met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Baoding and briefly discussed diplomacy. Chiang is determined to resist, because there is no way to survive without resistance, and he would be letting down the forty-two countries that passed the report.

Since the 29th Army bravely resisted and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, the enemy is reinforcing and will continue to attack, but we have taken strict precautions. If the enemy attacks, we will give them a head-on blow. He met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Baoding, reported on his trip to Europe to inspect industries, and offered suggestions for resisting Japan. He will go to Shanghai immediately to meet with President Wang Jingwei. Zhu said that the front is still in a stalemate. We have deployed heavy troops to guard all passes along the Great Wall, and the volunteer army is scattered in the mountains outside the passes, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. The volunteer army has been fighting hard for more than ten months, making the enemy army afraid. Sun Dianying is still insisting on the front line. If every soldier were like this, how could the enemy army be so arrogant? Tang Yulin is also preparing to counterattack. Zhu Jiqing is now in the Chaoyang Temple Yiyuan Pass area. The Japanese have ambitious ambitions, and the so-called Greater Manchuria Plan is truly shocking. Since seizing our eastern provinces, they have seized various railways and used them exclusively for transporting troops. Passenger and freight transport are few, and they are often bombed, causing commercial decline. They issue checks and force their use, causing an economic panic. If our people do not die, we can recover lost territory with resolute resistance for one or two years, which should not be difficult. He is going to Shanghai to raise funds to assist refugees from the Northeast and disaster victims in Shaanxi, and will stay for about ten days. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Four-Year Completion Plan</h3>
<p>Due to Continued Suspension of Boxer Indemnity Payments</p>
<p>Will Suffer a Major Blow</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zeng Zhongming said that the issuance of public bonds with 1.2 million pounds of the British Boxer Indemnity as collateral is being actively expedited to complete the funding for the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Unexpectedly, due to the start of the national crisis, it was decided to continue suspending the payment of the Boxer Indemnity for another year, which will severely impact the four-year completion plan. However, the Ministry of Railways believes that this road is of great importance and cannot be affected by this, and it is now trying to remedy the situation. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Yi-Le Area</p>
<h3>Intense Suppression of Communists</h3>
<p>Red Bandits Trapped in an Encirclement</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Urgent Dispatch: The false First Front Army, consisting of 40,000 to 50,000 men, scurried to Dongpi and Huangpi in the Yi Huang, Le'an, and Chongren counties on the 24th, fiercely attacking Taipingxu and attempting to attack our rear. In addition to a certain column feigning an advance towards Guangchang, we ambushed heavy troops in the Yi-Le area. The bandits, unaware that we were prepared, desperately advanced northward. The Ma and Yang columns launched a simultaneous attack, and a certain force counterattacked from Guangchang. The bandits were trapped in the center of the encirclement and were bombed by land and air for three days and nights. Ma Yang's battle was fierce, which was only seen in the suppression of communists. Currently, Xu and Xiao-Tian-Li's divisions from Nanfeng are increasing their troops from a certain place to jointly encircle, hoping to eliminate the main force of the bandits. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Huang Renhuan's division is in contact with the 19th Route Army and is advancing from a certain place to Yunmen Ridge to cut off the communication between the bandits in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian. The bandits have dismantled the fortifications they built, fearing that they will be occupied by us. The false central government has moved three times a day in Liancheng, Bo Tingzhou, and Ruizhou in Fujian, and has now moved to Lirenkeng in the border area of Wan'an, Xingguo, and Ganzhou. The bandit leaders are all stationed here. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Telegraphing to Encourage Overseas Chinese to Donate</h3>

<p>Soviet Russia Notice</p>
<h3>Banning Japanese Fishermen</h3>
<p>Significant Impact on Japanese-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun on the 19th, Soviet Russia is recently seeking to actively develop North Pacific fisheries. The competition for the eighth-year fishing zone was fiercely competed recently, and Russia was particularly fierce. Since the reversal of the situation between Japan and Russia in the North Pacific fisheries, the Russian side has gradually reduced the number of Japanese fishery laborers it hires each year. Therefore, the labor issue has long caused great panic. Unexpectedly, Russia suddenly announced again that it would prohibit the employment of Japanese fishery laborers this year. This notice has been forwarded by the Vladivostok Lyuri Trading Association to the Hakodate Branch, which has notified the members of the Fisheries Agency Mutual Aid Association, and the Mutual Aid Association has sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Russian Embassy in Japan, and the representatives of the Trade Department. If Soviet Russia refuses to withdraw its order, more than 2,200 Japanese crab boat laborers in the Soviet Russian state-run fishery will also lose their jobs. Therefore, the Soviet Union's forcible autonomous fishery policy may have a significant impact on Japanese-Soviet relations.</p>
<h3>British Economic Panic and Unemployment (Continued)</h3>
<p>What is the current situation of British workers who are employed? Were they able to see the "everyone gets bread and labor" check that was promised in 1931 at the New Year every year? Not at all. What the workers got was reduced wages, unemployment, and short-time work.</p>
<p>In 1932, British workers lost a total of no less than 13 million pounds in wages. Transportation workers lost the most, with a total wage loss of £3,250,000. Next, textile workers' wages were reduced by £3,200,000, construction workers' wages were reduced by £2,425,000, public agency employees' wages were reduced by £1,140,000, and rural workers lost about £600,000 in wages. Steel workers' wages were reduced by £472,000, water, electricity, and gas workers' wages were reduced by £287,500, garment workers lost £285,000 in wages, metal workers (excluding the aforementioned steel workers) lost £257,500, shipbuilding workers lost £242,500, timber workers lost £210,000, miners lost £100,750, pottery and chemical workers lost £100,000, and so on.</p>
<p>However, these figures are not enough to represent the actual situation of wage reductions in 1932, because the low wages revealed by the Labor Department refer to wage reductions that occurred after a certain wage dispute or wage negotiation. For example, the number of miner wages lost above does not include the reduction in the "piecework standard" and "pound weight standard" that played a major role in all coal mines last year. The same is true for many other economic sectors. By studying the production statistics of the United Kingdom in 1932, it is not difficult to see that the production volume of the United Kingdom is constantly and progressively decreasing, and the rate of decrease is greater in the fourth quarter. Taking the output of the United Kingdom in 1924 as equal to 100, we get the following index:</p>
<p>First quarter of 1930 110.9</p>
<p>First quarter of 1932 95.0</p>
<p>Second quarter of 1932 94.3</p>
<p>Third quarter of 1932 86.9</p>
<p>(The index for the fourth quarter of 1932 is not yet available) Studying the export figures also shows a decrease in export volume:</p>
<p>Exports of British goods (average pounds per month)</p>
<p>1924 66,700,000</p>
<p>1929 70,000,000</p>
<p>1931 32,400,000</p>
<p>1932 30,400,000</p>
<p>The figures for January 1933, which were just released,</p>
<p>Naturally show an even greater reduction.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has indeed saved a lot of money under the names of employed and unemployed workers. 1932 will go down in history as the most "economical" year. In 1932, the number of suicides, admissions to mental hospitals, deaths, etc., increased day by day, and the birth rate decreased significantly. 1933 began with an epidemic that fully revealed the malnutrition of the working masses. In the first five weeks of this year, more than 7,000 people died from the epidemic. (The End)</p>
<p>After Sun Ke Came to Shanghai to Persuade Him to Stay</p>
<h3>President Wang's Intention to Resign May Be Dispelled</h3>
<p>Chiang's Telegram Conveyed Sincere Encouragement Through Wu</p>
<p>Tonight or Tomorrow Night's Train to Beijing</p>
<p>Sun Says the Only Way Out for Our Country Is Resistance</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei has repeatedly expressed humility and concession about resuming the position of President of the Executive Yuan. After the Central Standing Committee decided to send Sun Ke and Gu Mengyu to Shanghai one after another yesterday and today to persuade him to stay, Wang has agreed to go to Beijing tonight or tomorrow night to discuss the selection of a successor and meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on a regular basis. At the same time, Wang's remarks in his statement imply that his intention to resign may have been dispelled. The following is a transcript:</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Sun Ke and Gu Mengyu, the representatives sent by the Central Government to persuade Wang to stay, arrived in Shanghai last night, with Gu visiting Wang earlier to urge him to remain in his post. Sun also left Beijing on the night train last night and arrived in Shanghai at around 8:00 AM this morning. After getting off the train, Sun first returned to his Shanghai residence at 22 Columbia Road to rest.</p>
<h3>Sun and Wu Visit Wang</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM, he went to Wang's residence on Bo Shi Road to visit Wang and discuss the matter, and conveyed the Central Government's intentions, asking Wang to return to Beijing immediately to resume his post. Wang was initially modest and declined, but after Sun's repeated urging, and because Song did not agree to succeed him, Wang finally agreed to go to Beijing in the next few days to discuss the selection of a successor. After talking for more than an hour, Sun finally left at 10:10 AM. At 10:20 AM, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng visited Wang to inquire about Wang's views on resuming his post and to persuade him to stay, and left at 10:40 AM.</p>
<h3>Wang's Statement</h3>
<p>After Sun visited Wang and left, Wang personally sent him out and then issued a statement to the reporters of the New Sound News Agency, saying that he had resigned from the Central Government and proposed that Song succeed him. After arriving in Shanghai, he went to visit Song and asked him to formally take office, but Song could not take on the position of President of the Executive Yuan because he also had very heavy responsibilities in handling finance. As a result, the Central Government still ordered him to take on the role. Sun came here this morning to talk, and the result was a decision to wait until tonight or tomorrow night to go to Beijing to discuss the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan, and then decide on another suitable successor. If there is still no suitable candidate, then whether he will resume his post will be discussed again. As for the time and place of the meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, it is difficult to announce for the time being because it involves military affairs. His tone seems to imply that his intention to resign may have been dispelled.</p>
<h3>Wu's Statement</h3>
<p>After Wu Tiecheng visited Wang and left, he told the reporters of the New Sound News Agency at the Municipal Government that Mr. Wang will go to Beijing tonight or tomorrow to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. As for whether Chiang will return south or Mr. Wang will go north, and where the meeting will take place, it is not convenient to announce. The issue of the President of the Executive Yuan will be discussed after Mr. Wang returns to Beijing. It is reported that Wu visited Wang this morning on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, conveying his sincerity in persuading Wang to resume his post.</p>
<h3>Sun's Statement</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road at 11:00 AM this morning and issued a statement, saying that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will definitely return to Beijing within one or two days. Mr. Wang, after our delegation conveyed the will of the Central Government and earnestly persuaded him, agreed to go to Beijing in the next few days and will discuss the issue of resuming his position as President of the Executive Yuan after arriving in Beijing. According to my speculation, it is hoped that his intention to resign can be dispelled, because the duties of the President of the Executive Yuan are heavy, and there is really no suitable candidate for the time being other than Wang and Song. The intention of the various committees in the Central Government is not just Wang's personal affiliation. The government will not compromise with Japan, but will only resist with all its strength. The fighting continues along the Great Wall. Because what the League of Nations can do has already been done. If our country no longer makes efforts, why would the League of Nations offend Japan and impose sanctions? There is no new way other than resisting to win international sympathy. The government's opinion is that there is room for negotiation if Japan cancels the puppet state and withdraws its invading troops from the three eastern provinces and Rehe. Since the attitude declared by the Japanese side does not comply with the international justice claims and our country is determined not to yield, it is really impossible to have direct negotiations between the two countries at present. There are many foreigners in China who are making all kinds of unfavorable propaganda to our country. Since they have nothing to do with our pain, they only hope that our country can be safe for a while, so as not to affect their trade with China, which is profitable. In our country, recognizing Japan's invasion of the eastern provinces and Rehe is tantamount to giving up Tianjin and Beijing, which is what our country should resist to the end. Mr. Wang will go to Beijing within one or two days, and I plan to go with him.</p>
<h3>Returning to Beijing Today or Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei has agreed to go to Beijing again to discuss the issue of succeeding after Gu Mengyu and Sun Zhesheng came to Shanghai to persuade him to stay. He plans to take the Beijing-Shanghai night express train tonight or tomorrow night and travel to Beijing in the same car with Sun Zhesheng.</p>
<p>Communist Red Army Commander</p>
<h3>Chen Guang Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>丨Many Reactionary Documents Seized丨</p>
<p>Chen Guang (also known as Chen Geng), a native of Henan, the commander of the Communist Red Army's 14th Army and the chief of the First Section of the Special Service Department's Investigation Division, is an important figure in the Communist Party. He was recently sent to Shanghai for secret work. Yesterday, while passing through Beijing Road, he was spotted by a supervisor from the Public Security Bureau and was immediately arrested and taken to the Lao Zha Gate Police Station. Together with detectives from the police station, they seized many reactionary documents at 293 Mei Baek Road. This morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Branch of the High Court. Presiding Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhou and Jiang and Prosecutor Zhang, took the stand to interrogate him. Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the police station, explained the circumstances of the arrest and requested that the case be postponed for investigation. Subsequently, the representative of the Public Security Bureau requested permission to transfer the case and presented two Communist Party members, Zhang and others, who had surrendered themselves, as witnesses. According to Zhang et al., Chen Geng was indeed the chief of the First Section of the Communist Party's Special Service Department, and they were colleagues in Wuhan. His wife, Huang Genying, is also an important figure in the Communist Party and is currently the Minister of Women's Affairs of the National Federation of Trade Unions of the Communist Party. When questioned, Chen Geng confessed that after graduating from the Huangpu Military Academy, he served as a battalion commander and other positions, and then joined the Communist Party. He confirmed that Zhang was indeed a colleague and that he came to Shanghai to manage transportation for the Communist Party's Military Commission. In 1919, the Communist Party became suspicious of him, and he left without an exit in 1920. Judge Yu verified the confession and ordered Chen to be detained and interrogated again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Tianchu Aircraft Ordered from Germany</h3>
<p>The Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory donated 100,000 yuan to purchase the Tianchu aircraft and specially presented it to the Aviation Association, which has been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that the factory has decided to order a fighter plane from the German Junkers Company and has sent a letter to the Aviation Association to apply for a passport.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Railway</p>
<h3>Shortening Travel Time</h3>
<p>Express Train Changed to Six and a Half Hours</p>
<p>In Order to Increase Commuter Trains</p>
<p>According to Mo Heng, head of the General Affairs Section of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, the following are the reform matters of the two railways:</p>
<h3>Shorten Time and Increase Frequency</h3>
<p>Due to various reasons, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway special express train takes eight hours to complete its journey, which is not only inconvenient for passengers, but also makes it difficult to adjust the train. Therefore, it has been decided to shorten the journey to six and a half hours. After the time is shortened, it will be easier to adjust the train and increase the frequency of trains. Therefore, it has been decided to implement it next month, and a commuter express train will be added to the Shanghai-Changzhou section and a commuter train will be added to the Zhenjiang-Nanjing section.</p>
<h3>Second-Class Sleeping Cars to Be Added</h3>
<p>The vehicles and equipment of the two railways are not perfect, so they urgently need to be reformed to ensure the safety of passengers. As for the sleeping cars on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, only first-class has this equipment, and each car only has eight rooms, accommodating sixteen passengers. It is now planned to add second-class sleeping cars, which are expected to be realized within two months.</p>
<h3>Song Road Pier Decided to Be Reformed</h3>
<p>The construction of the cargo pier next to the Song-Shanghai Zhongyun Zao Pond Station is not complete, which makes it extremely inconvenient to load and unload goods. Zhongyun Zao Pond is an important hub for Song-Shanghai water and land transportation, and there are many goods being loaded and unloaded. Therefore, it has been decided to expand it and add the latest construction, so that goods can be loaded and unloaded by machinery instead of manual labor.</p>
<h3>Suspension of New Station Construction Has Been Ordered</h3>
<p>As for the relocation and construction of the joint railway station of the two railways, the railway authorities have decided to postpone it for various reasons. The bureau has received the order from the ministry, but it is not yet known whether the land previously demarcated will be immediately invalidated. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways has recently sent counselors to Shanghai to discuss solutions with the municipal government.</p>
<p>Famous Bandit</p>
<h3>Little Ji Zi's Unique Skill</h3>
<p>Can Make Eyes Stare Straight with Pupils Ceasing Activity</p>
<p>White Foam Flows from the Mouth, Resembling a Sudden Illness Leading to Death</p>
<p>丨Escaped from Prison Last Night, Arrested Again Yesterday丨</p>
<p>Little Ji Zi, a famous bandit who roams around the Caojiadu area of ​​western Shanghai, whose real name is Zeng Fanji, is from the Jianghuai area. Since coming to Shanghai, he has specialized in recruiting bandits to engage in robbery activities, committing crimes repeatedly. But in addition to being a bandit and robbing, he also has a unique skill, being able to feign illness. In an instant, he can make his eyes stare straight, his pupils stop moving, and white foam flow from his mouth, just like a sudden onset of acute illness. He can also go without food or water for three to five days. Therefore, every time he is arrested, he uses this skill to escape the law. It is said that the Gordon Road Police Station, the Yulin Road Police Station, and the Hongkou Police Station of the Public Concession have all arrested him for various cases, but the bandit has used this fake illness to deceive the police officers after being arrested, so although he has been to the police station three times, he has never been convicted once, which has made him more courageous and robbed more severely. Recently, he was arrested again by Liu Shaokui, a detective from the General Inspectorate of the General Patrol Room. The bandit still used his usual trick, immediately staring blankly and feigning a coma. Detective Liu did not know that he was pretending and thought he was really sick, so he quickly sent him to the hospital. The doctor was initially deceived and gave him a life-saving injection. The bandit endured the pain and did not eat for four consecutive days. However, in the end, the doctor diagnosed him clearly and determined that it was indeed a fake illness, and notified the police station to take him back into custody. They immediately investigated the various cases he had committed over the years and found that he had committed no less than ten cases. Yesterday afternoon was the date of interrogation, and the prisoner, fearing that it would be difficult to escape imprisonment this time, took the opportunity to escape from prison last night. When the First Special District Local Court opened the trial of the case yesterday afternoon, the trial of the Da Ji Zi portion was temporarily suspended, and the police station was ordered to strictly arrest him and punish him. As a result, at 8:00 PM last night, he was arrested again by General Detective Lu Liankui and Liu Shaokui on Kang Nuo Road. This morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court and interrogated by Judge Qian Hongye. Bao Yi, a lawyer from the police station, explained the details and requested a postponement of the trial and to jointly try the case with his accomplices Zeng Chongshan, Zeng Zhixiang, Zhang Ji Er, Gu Shugen, Xiao Shunli, etc. Judge Qian verified the case, briefly interrogated the defendants, and ordered them to be detained and to postpone the trial.</p>
<h3>Concession Water Dispute</h3>
<p>丨Invisibly Temporarily Suspended丨</p>
<p>Regarding the public concession water price increase dispute in this port, although the Bureau of Works has mediated repeatedly, it has not been resolved for several months. This morning, according to news from tax-paying Chinese, the dispute has been invisibly temporarily suspended. After mediation by all parties, the amount of the water price increase is one-third of the original price. Currently, the tenants are still expressing their opposition. It is still difficult to know whether it will be resolved in the future.</p>
<p>Wang Delin and His Family and Subordinates</p>
<h3>Left Qingdao Last Night Heading South</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai by Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>The family members and subordinates of the Northeast Anti-Japanese General Wang Delin, a total of 158 people, as well as more than 100 refugees, came to Shanghai from Vladivostok on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wuyang Wheel. Various groups such as the Shanghai Local Association Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association have prepared to welcome them at the pier and have designated the Shanghai Grand Hotel as the receiving location. The reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Zhao Yuntai, the chief of the shipping department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, yesterday. According to him, the Wuyang Wheel departed from Qingdao at 7 PM on the 24th and is expected to arrive in port around the afternoon of the 26th, docking at the Jin Liyuan Wharf.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Two Groups of Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>丨Nothing is as Difficult as Earning a Living丨</p>
<p>Using Bricks and Bamboo Poles as Weapons</p>
<p>Traffic Disrupted and Cries Heard Everywhere</p>
<p>Between Avenue Road, Hart Road, and Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai, at 10:45 AM today, a major fight broke out between the rickshaw pullers and the cart pullers. The reason for the fight was that the rickshaw pullers in the area felt that all their business had been completely taken away by the carts, making it impossible for them to make a living. Therefore, they gathered about a hundred people this morning at the intersection of Avenue Road and Hart Road. When they saw five or six carts working in the Xiaoshadu Road area at around 10 AM, they each held bricks and rushed towards the cart pullers in the east. At that time, there were also forty or fifty cart pullers, each holding bamboo poles to fight back. A chaotic battle immediately broke out, with cries heard everywhere, and traffic was disrupted as a result. The chaotic battle lasted for about a quarter of an hour. The Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, having received the report, dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives and police cars to the scene and immediately ordered arrests. When the rickshaw pullers saw the detectives arriving, they scattered in all directions. More than thirty people and more than twenty rickshaws were captured on the spot and taken to the police station for detention. Among the more than thirty people arrested, nine were injured, but the injuries were all minor.</p>
<p>Brawl Among British and American Workers</p>
<h3>The Union Petitions the Party Headquarters for Mediation</h3>
<p>Nine Seriously Injured Hospitalized in the Orthopedic Hospital</p>
<p>Not a Dispute Arising from Elections</p>
<p>At the British-American New Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, a mutual fight occurred yesterday between workers from the leaf-packing section and the tin-packing section. The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union specifically petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters today to mediate for the injured workers, who have now been admitted to the orthopedic hospital for treatment. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Truth of the Incident: According to Chen Peide, a standing committee member of the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the cause of this incident was that last Friday (the 17th), Zhuang Baoqing, a worker from the tobacco silk section, was carrying a thermos and lunchbox. Because it was quitting time and the number of people was crowded, a worker from the new leaf section accidentally bumped into him, scalding his foot with the water. Zhuang apologized, but the other worker did not accept it, leading to a physical altercation. The Third District Detention Center handled the matter with punishment. Unexpectedly, at 12 PM yesterday, another fight broke out over this matter. Nine people were immediately detained, and the union went to bail them out and scheduled a mediation meeting at 5 PM. Unexpectedly, at 12:50 PM when work resumed, more than eighty workers from the leaf-packing section ambushed the entrance of the tin-packing section inside the factory. As soon as the foreman Zhu Zhaolin arrived, they attacked him indiscriminately with iron rods, leading to a mutual fight. Although the union sent representatives such as Fei Keguang to the factory to maintain order, it was ineffective. As for the reports saying that the dispute arose from competing for election, that is completely untrue. It has been verified that both sections have already held elections.</p>
<p>Worker Injuries: A total of nine people were injured: (1) Zhu Zhaolin, foreman of the tin-packing section, 53 years old, from Shaoxing, seriously injured in the head, waist, and legs, sent to the orthopedic hospital; (2) Zhang Aoqi, worker of the tin-packing section, 34 years old, from Shaoxing, seriously injured in the head and waist, sent to the orthopedic hospital; (3) Zhang Asu, worker of the tin-packing section, 24 years old, from Shaoxing, slightly injured in the eyes and head, has already been discharged from the hospital; (4) Zhong Aren, worker of the tin-packing section, 26 years old, from Shaoxing, seriously injured in the waist, staying in the orthopedic hospital; (5) Zhang Awu, worker of the tin-packing section, 27 years old, from Shaoxing, seriously injured in the head, staying in the orthopedic hospital; (6) Zhu Atang, worker of the tin-packing section, 23 years old, from Shaoxing, slightly injured in the waist, staying in the orthopedic hospital; (7) Ding Shanhai, worker of the tobacco leaf section, 28 years old, staying in the orthopedic hospital; (8) Wang Boqing, worker of the tobacco leaf section, 18 years old, injured in the head; (9) Gao Jinyuan, worker of the tobacco leaf section, the injury is unclear.</p>
<p>Petition to the Party Headquarters: Regarding the urgent report, yesterday at noon, a portion of the workers from the Xin Factory tin-packing section and the Xin Factory leaf section of our union engaged in a mutual fight. Our union, caught by surprise and unable to prevent it, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, but persuasion was ineffective. Each side suffered injuries on the spot. After investigation, it was learned that the incident stemmed from a minor matter. Previously, a worker named Zhuang Baoqing from the Xin tobacco silk section was leaving the factory at the end of the workday on the 21st of this month, carrying a lunchbox. Because of the crowded conditions during the workday, a worker from the Xin leaf section (name unknown) accidentally bumped into him, scalding his foot with spilled water. Zhuang Baoqing immediately apologized to the worker on the spot, but the worker refused to accept the apology and immediately resorted to violence, showering him with punches. After leaving the factory, they ran into each other on the way and engaged in a mutual fight, which was punished by the Third District Public Security Bureau on both sides. Unexpectedly, after the worker left, he plotted revenge. Some troublemakers in the section further incited the situation, and one person started, and a hundred followed. Yesterday morning, when workers from the Xin leaf section were leaving work, they did not go home for lunch. Most of them waited outside the factory, and when the workers from the tin-packing section left the factory, they attacked them indiscriminately, leading to another conflict between the two sides. The Second Squadron of the police detachment in charge of the area heard the news and dispatched police to suppress the situation, arresting four workers from the Xin tin section and four workers from the Xin leaf and Xin tobacco silk sections on the spot. Upon hearing the news, our union immediately sent personnel to the squadron to bail out the people on both sides and scheduled a meeting after the end of the workday in the afternoon to mediate. Our union, fearing that further accidents might occur, sent personnel to the factory to maintain order. Unexpectedly, at 1 PM on the same day, a hundred workers from the Xin silk and Xin tobacco silk sections, each carrying iron rods, broke into the Xin Factory tin-packing section and beat the headman Zhu Zhaolin, worker Zhang Aoqi, and six others, among whom Zhu Zhaolin was seriously injured and feared for his life. Our union sent personnel to witness the scene, but the mob was too fierce and could not be stopped. Our union also received a report from the Xin tin representatives Zhang Mufang and Lou Jingguan, stating that during the incident, the Xin leaf workers Tang Songlin, Shen Baokang, and Gao Jinyuan were seen leading the workers and ordering a riot, and that a petitioning police officer (name unknown) and an unidentified person were helping the rioters. They requested that a letter be sent to the Public Security Bureau to arrest and severely investigate the matter. They also claimed that this riot by the Xin leaf workers, in addition to Shen Baokang and Tang Songlin being the leaders, was instigated by someone else who had been plotting for a long time and that this incident was merely an excuse to vent their anger. They requested that the matter be investigated together. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>After the Yuetong Ship Ran Aground</p>
<h3>The Hull Sank and the Crew Has Been Rescued</h3>
<p>Cargo and Passengers Are Being Salvaged with Efforts</p>
<p>The Naval Department Has Sent Ships to Protect Against Theft</p>
<p>The Yuetong steamship of the Yuetai Shipping Company, which was sailing south from Dalian with cargo, ran aground on Gaobei Mountain at Xinghua Estuary in Fujian Province the day before yesterday morning. The ship has now been flooded and sunk, and the crew has been rescued. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Crew Rescued</h3>
<p>The Yuetong Wheel is 912 gross tons and 1,700 deadweight tons. The owner of the ship is Japanese man Sanshen Longxiong. After running aground on Gaobei Mountain while transporting soybeans and other goods from Dalian to Xinghua, the captain immediately sent a radio request for help. The Fujian branch of the company and the Xinghua local customs were the first to receive the report and immediately dispatched patrol boats and tugboats to rescue the ship. They saw that the ship had tilted and flooded, and the cargo was wet. They immediately found a way to rescue all 40+ crew members and sent patrol boats to dock alongside the Yuetong Wheel to provide protection.</p>
<h3>The Hull Sinks</h3>
<p>The Yuetai Shipping Company received a radio message from the Yuetong ship at 9 AM on the 25th, informing them that the hull was tilting and sinking, and the first two compartments were flooded to a depth of about 1.3 to 1.4 zhang [~4-4.5 meters], which was extremely dangerous.

<h3>Ding Xixi, Who Hides in the Toilet</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Japanese imperialists, with their lackeys and pawns, [invading] warlords, arbitrarily trample over half of the northeastern territory of our country, tearing up international covenants, and destroying world peace. Is it not known what use is there for the puppet Puyi? What favors do they give to the puppet Puyi? On the one hand, they use extremely vicious and fierce faces and methods to seize our territory, and on the other hand, they generously and forcibly place a yellow robe on the puppet's body, pushing him to the forefront, even glorifying his name as: the "Chief Executive of the new state of Manchukuo"! If Japan did not have ulterior motives, adopting the old tricks of the conquered Korea, and wanting to ease the international atmosphere to cover up its aggressive ambitions, then how could there be such a ridiculous thing in ancient and modern China and abroad?</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, when foreign races invade and use domestic traitors, no matter how bad the situation is, there are openly domestic traitors like Zhang Bangchang and Wu Sangui, shamelessly unaware of their shame, willing to be running dogs for foreign races. Is this not a strange thing?</p>
<p>At a time when the Japanese warlords are strutting high and venting their bestiality on the borders of our Great Wall, which is when our countrymen's cries of grief and indignation are heard remotely, the other day, a noble guest suddenly returned from Europe, arrogantly pleased, claiming to be a dignified representative of a new country (?), the traitor Ding Shiyuan, graced our port. And he didn't hesitate to hide his noble body deep in the toilet, a bizarre anecdote that was widely reported in the newspapers. This noble guest originally planned to stay in Shanghai for a week, continuing to fulfill his running dog duties and vehemently denouncing the internal affairs of the motherland to foreign residents in Shanghai, defending Japan's aggressive policies. However, as a result, for some unknown reason, this noble guest suddenly tiptoed quietly north, which is very worthy of our attention. Is it because the bumps in Geneva, London, and Paris hurt him, and he no longer has the courage to come to Shanghai to open his stinky mouth and fart? Or is it because the sight of the situation and objects stirred his heart, and he had no face to face the motherland's rivers and mountains and see the elders of the motherland? Or is it because there are many patriotic heroes from our country and Korea in Shanghai, and the previous bombing cases have made Ding the traitor's heart tremble with coldness, and for the sake of his dog's life, he decided to take the thirty-sixth strategy and run away? One of the above reasons must be true for Ding the traitor, but they are all enough to make Ding the traitor droop his head in frustration, his skin loose and his bones weak, not only eager to go north, but also afraid of interviews with Japanese reporters, hiding in the toilet for a long time, inhaling exotic scents, and enjoying them as if they were delicacies, because the situation made it so!</p>
<p>Alas, what wrong has the dignity of the traitor Ding done? In various places in Europe, he just suffered bumps and choked on white lime, and the old wounds were still not healed; and now he has enjoyed the strange and wonderful taste in the toilet, and for a long time! It is truly a case of "Heaven makes a calamity, you can still avoid it; self-made calamities cannot be avoided!"</p>
<h3>Refuting the Education Circle's Telegram Accusing Zhang of Failing to Plan Properly</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Reading the news column of the newspaper from the 17th of this month, more than 320 people from the education circle in this city, including Jiang Hengyuan, Ni Wenya, and Yang Weiyu, jointly sent a telegram to the National Government's Executive Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Military Commission, requesting that General Zhang Xueliang, who recently resigned and came to Shanghai, and whom important figures flocked to the airport to welcome, be punished according to law. I cannot help but feel furious and lament that these bookworms do not understand the truth and are acting recklessly. I am willing to act as a pro bono lawyer for General Zhang and defend him. Therefore, I present a rigorous rebuttal to the telegram as follows: (1) The Republic of China is owned by the 470 million people of the nation. The government is determined to resist for a long time and has an overall plan. These are rhetorical statements used for external propaganda, relying on the entire nation as a backing. There are many righteous volunteer armies in the Northeast who can fight bitterly against the Japanese in the icy and snowy regions. How can it be said that "the important task of the border region is completely entrusted to Zhang Xueliang alone"? Moreover, it was the advisors of the Kuomintang who replaced the five-colored flag in the three northeastern provinces with the blue sky, white sun, and red earth flag. When the Japanese army first attacked the Beida Camp, Zhang was ill in Beiping and could not do anything. This time, in the invasion of Rehe, regardless of success or failure, tens of thousands of subordinates have sacrificed for the country. Zhang had already explained this in his telegram to comrades across the country on the 11th of this month. Did Jiang Hengyuan and others not read the newspapers and pretend not to know? Therefore, there are still official pronouncements such as "Zhang Xueliang has been raised by the state for generations. He should sacrifice himself for the country, which is what he should do." (2) Playing golf and dancing are legitimate games for modern young people. Zhang was recognized by the great British writer George Bernard Shaw as the most promising general among Chinese youth. He should learn these things to facilitate social interaction. Shuncheng Prince's Mansion was the office of the general in charge of the defense of Beiping and was located in Beiping, which was inconvenient to move. How can it be said that he "usually indulged in sensual pleasures and enjoyed himself in the old capital, neglecting military and national affairs"? (3) The fall of Chengde this time was actually due to Tang Yulin's usual oppression of the people to grow tobacco, arbitrary taxation, and embezzlement of military pay, which caused public resentment and led to the troops not to obey orders. Therefore, he seized a car and fled with his concubine. Tang was Zhang's father's colleague, and Zhang was far away in Beiping. How could he have known that the front line was so corrupt? Moreover, he had already become furious after the fact and telegraphed the central government to punish Tang. How can it be said that "the enemy invaded from the west, and the entire front collapsed in less than ten days," and blame him for what he was doing? (4) Although Zhang has resigned, he is still highly talented. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek feared that he would go abroad and said that he still had important matters to entrust to him, so he persuaded him to stay in Shanghai. He Yingqin warned his subordinates in Beiping, saying that Zhang was in Shanghai for recuperation due to environmental reasons and would return soon. Someone, fearing that he would be lonely, accompanied him for meals. All parties respected him in this way, but the telegram said that "for Zhang Xueliang's personal sake, he had long been ashamed and resentful and committed suicide," and scolded him for being "shameless" and said that "punishment according to law is the minimum requirement," which not only insults high officials but also incites suicide. Beheading is the ultimate punishment, and they still say it is the minimum requirement. Is it like the saying, "Even if you kill the head, you still want to send it to the army"? I hope that the more than 320 bookworms in the education circle will not act recklessly like this in the future, otherwise, I am afraid there will be inconveniences.</p>

<h3>Collecting Lu Fangweng's Seven-Character Poems to Form Ten Exquisite Quatrains</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Some do not follow the rhyme</p>
<p>Some do not follow the rhyme</p>
<p>A chivalrous spirit towers over the nine provinces, where in the world is there a place to bury grief? Where is Yuguan, where is the vast sea? Gazing in confusion, I am filled with sorrow!</p>
<p>When will the clouds and seas clear this heart? The Central Plains were hastily lost in peace. The surviving people endure death to see restoration, who misled the country back then but one Qin?</p>
<p>There is no one to use Yue Fei in the military tent, the wise men cannot reach the hearts of the people. The high officials in Chang'an are full of worry and fear, how can you young people know?</p>
<p>Only tax collectors knock on the door, the markets are sparse and the people's strength is depleted. No military reports have been heard from beyond the border, the generals do not fight and only stand at the border.</p>
<p>My efforts to achieve fame are lost, the sweeping away of the barbarians is still unfinished. Looking at the ruined and ravaged, it is deemed appropriate, but no one weeps like the newly arrived.</p>
<p>Military reports fly day and night, the joy is like a game of chess about to end. The surviving people have wept until their tears are gone in the dust of the barbarians, yet the Central Plains are still at peace.</p>
<p>Rich merchants and powerful officials accumulate great wealth, the poor still struggle to eat even in good years. The red gates teach singing and dancing every day, the common people of the world have not yet been revived.</p>
<p>Who can succeed the Western Plains? Drunkenly listening to the plucked strings playing frontier songs. The party disaster originates from the famous families, and the fragrant and foul are all scholars.</p>
<p>The evening bugles choke the riverside city, in my dream, I still see Luoyang flowers. Prosperity and decline have been endless since ancient times, the sun sets in the sound of drums and towers.</p>
<p>In the year of abundance, rice is cheap, yet the body is hungry alone. There is danger everywhere in the world. Do not laugh at my madly chanting drunk, I only know my inch of lonely sorrow.</p>
<h3>China Needs "Sex" Education Films</h3>
<p>— Naff</p>
<p>In China, the lack of "sex" education is undeniable. From the moment children are born until they become adults, parents have not said a word to them about "sex," and even when they enter school, teachers have not given them the baptism of "sex" education. Therefore, Chinese children have no knowledge of "sex" at all. This was the situation in the past.</p>
<p>Even now, in the so-called civilized present, which is more advanced than before, although the educational aspect has paid attention to this issue, and at the same time, under the influence of Western culture after the opening of the sea ban, this issue has already embarked on the road of lifting the ban. However, this is only the case in urban areas. If you enter the countryside, the phenomenon of "men and women not handing things to each other" has not been eliminated, and there is no such thing as "sex" education. Even in urban areas, it is only possible to abandon the old ethical concepts; "sex" education is still out of the question.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to make the general public understand the issue of "sex," on the one hand, we must start with school education. However, since education in China has not yet been universal, we can only seek other ways to help and remedy the situation. This so-called other aspect, which is also more universal, is the cinema.</p>
<p>If we can put in effort into "sex" education in the cinema, not only children can gain knowledge of "sex," but it can also enable people who are deluded by the old ethical concepts to gain a considerable understanding. In this way, they (referring to people who have not received sex education but are now parents) will naturally regard the "sex" issue, which they formerly considered mysterious, as not mysterious or secretive and teach it to their children.</p>
<p>Comrades who are concerned about film education, "sex" education, and executives of film production companies! You should be responsible for this issue. What do you think?</p>
<h3>In the Hospital</h3>
<p>— Ke Wu</p>
<p>Painful symbols are often found in this small hospital; workers in these black-devil-like factories who have a finger or a hand crushed are common tragedies. Some very beautiful girls come to treat diseases of the lower body, get an injection of 606, and that also happens every day. Bad feet and bad hands are really treated dozens of times every day; but in the hospital there are many tragic scenes. Except for a few young girls who come to treat frostbite and let out a coquettish sound with the doctors, or teasing sounds, that is an occasional comedy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the doctor, who has been seeing patients in white coats for seventy or eighty numbers in the morning, and the nurses are also a little tired, mostly lying lazily in their chairs reading newspapers;</p>
<p>"What illness are you seeing"?</p>
<p>"Sir! She ate raw opium"! The man said for her.</p>
<p>"How much did she eat? When did she eat it"? The doctor asked, taking her pulse.</p>
<p>"She bought four jiao [a currency unit] worth of opium, ate half of it, ate it this morning"!</p>
<p>"You are dizzy now, and your stomach is uncomfortable, right"?</p>
<p>"Ah! Yes! Sir"! she said mournfully.</p>
<p>So the doctor used copper sulfate to fill a large glass of distilled water for her to drink. In less than a moment, she vomited. She drank white water and vomited again, vomited and ate again, but she did not vomit the opium. The doctor kept examining her temperature and pulse.</p>
<p>"Why did she want to eat opium"?</p>
<p>"I wasn't at home, she had a quarrel with her mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law said that she was a bad person who only knew how to eat and didn't know how to work, only knew how to play mahjong. So she quarreled with her mother-in-law; her mother-in-law wanted to drive her out and didn't want her to live at home anymore. She ate opium in a hurry..." The man said the reason why she ate opium, spraying saliva.</p>
<p>"Oh! That's a small matter! Are you feeling better now"?</p>
<p>"Sir, a little better"!</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, I'll give you an injection, okay"! So the doctor told the nurse to give her an injection of Atropin, and told her that there would be no danger and to go back and drink more strong tea or coffee tea.</p>
<p>The cost of medicine was five yuan, the man paid, and he staggered away supporting her. The hospital was silent again.</p>

<h3>Organizing a Small Family</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have abandoned my studies for commerce, and it has already been ten years. My monthly income is still only eighteen yuan. My loving mother unfortunately passed away last autumn; now there is only my elderly father left. I got married four years ago and already have a child who is now learning to walk; and the second child will soon be crying. In addition, I have three younger siblings. So the daily expenses are not saved. Fortunately, my father has been managing things from the middle, so we can get through year after year. My wife's family does not live in Shanghai; my wife often wants to return to Ningbo, and this travel expense is used separately, which really makes it very difficult for me. Unexpectedly, she recently had a whimsical idea and asked me to organize a small family near her parents' home. If I agree to her, the monthly income of eighteen yuan will not be enough. Moreover, my old father, who is nearing the end of his life, will have no one to serve, and I cannot bear to do this unfilial act. But if I don't agree to her, then… it's really hard to say… In short, I can't resist her. Now I can only ask you to think of a way for us to live a peaceful life: this is what I sincerely hope for!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Editor's note: In recent years, the issue of "large families" versus "small families" has sparked much discussion; their conclusions mostly agree on the organization of small families. Forcing a large string of brothers, uncles, aunts, sisters-in-law, etc., with different interests, to be forcibly combined together in the structure of a large family is certainly unnecessary, and indeed, under this structure, our zest for life can be completely buried. But we believe that parents, siblings, who are without self-reliance, cannot currently be excluded from the family structure. Our reasons are: (1) You have an obligation prescribed by law to support parents and siblings who have not solved their material needs. (2) Even if your parents, siblings, have already been able to solve their material needs, you cannot fail to take care of them. Because human survival, in addition to material needs, also requires spiritual comfort, especially for those self-reliant elderly and underage siblings. Confucius said the following words in his doctrine of "filial piety"; he said "As for birds and beasts, they can all nurture; without respect, how is it different?" This is the meaning! In European and American countries, where people are accustomed to "small family" living, a person, on the one hand, does not bear the obligation to support their parents, and on the other hand, does not have the right to be supported by their children. In China, where people are accustomed to "large family" living, a person, on the one hand, bears the obligation to support their parents, and on the other hand, enjoys the right to be supported by their children. On the surface, they seem completely different, but in terms of rights and obligations, they are roughly the same. But what can be received from children is that if we want to move from "large family" to "small family", then there must be a generation of people who are willing to sacrifice; they must support their parents on the one hand, but they must not shout "support" from their mouths. Such sacrificers should be those who change a system and become "social reformers", and should not be called upon by their grandfathers to do so. We hope that the young people who call themselves "social reformers" will, on the one hand, fulfill their legally prescribed obligations and support their parents and siblings with respect and reverence; on the other hand, make adequate preparations materially and spiritually, so that when they are old, they will have solutions materially and spiritually, and will not burden your children to support you. Do not borrow the beautiful name of "small family" as a protective talisman to shirk responsibility, and then turn around and call on your children to support you when you are old!</p>
<p>Judging from the letter, Mr. Bu's old father really has "the idea of not being able to finish his remaining years without Mr. Bu": therefore, it is appropriate not to form a small family. Moreover, your economic situation seems to be helped by his old man, so you can't act rashly. As for you not agreeing to your wife's request, it's really not difficult. You should know that "a wife's residence is her husband's residence" and "a married woman must have due respect for her parents-in-law" are both stipulated by law. In the end, only she can't resist you, there is no reason for you to resist her. But "harmony is precious" between families, so start with the word "persuade": in case she really doesn't listen, then you can use the "resist" method.</p>

<h3>Time in a Dream (12 Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"No, no! You've come at just the right time. Let them be busy, I'm not busy at all. Sit down quickly." Mai'e herself first sat down on a large sofa and let Wu Yi sit next to her. A female servant moved over an extremely exquisite small table and placed it between them. Another girl brought over two glass cups: one was a deep red strong tea, which was placed in front of Wu Yi, and the other was a milky white liquid, which was for Mai'e herself to drink.</p>
<p>Wu Yi was about to lift up the cup of black tea to sip when Mai'e suddenly snatched it away and handed him the thing that looked like cow's milk in front of her.</p>
<p>"Haven't you put lipstick on your lips? How are they so red?" Mai'e squinted at his lips, smiling playfully, but not giving him any chance to reply, and then抢一般地said, "But I know it's because your stomach is too hot. Well then, this is mare's milk, milk from our own horses, it's the coolest thing. You drink it!" Without giving him a chance to pretend to be humble, Mai'e had already sent the glass to his lips, pouring it down.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" Wu Yi felt that the taste of this cup of mare's milk was even sweeter than nectar. He hurriedly thanked her, but his eyes did not dare to turn around to look at Mai'e, and shot straight at the wall opposite.</p>
<p>On the wall, to the left of the calligraphy and paintings bearing the names of ××guan masters and ××ge masters, hung a small photograph. 丨丨 That was Lin Daping's photo. In the photo, Lin Daping's eyes seemed much sharper than usual. The moment Wu Yi's gaze came into contact with him, it was as if he had been doused with a bucket of ice water, and he felt a chill.</p>
<p>"What are you thanking me for! I'm very happy that you can come to drink every day. There's plenty here!" Sure enough, the girl brought another cup of mare's milk and handed it to Mai'e.</p>
<p>"Come to drink every day...?" Wu Yi muttered to himself, "I'm afraid this won't do. If Lin Daping finds out, it won't look good on his face!" Although he thought so at the time, the next day he involuntarily walked to Mai's house and lingered until twenty minutes after five o'clock, estimating that Lin Daping should be coming, before he abandoned his armor and abandoned his soldiers like a defeated general.</p>
<p>Indeed, Wu Yi's character and personality did make Lin Daping pale in comparison, and his strong eloquence easily catered to Mai'e's preferences. The opinions and ideas of the two people were often on the same line, so a love triangle model was lightly constructed.</p>
<p>This triangular stalemate unexpectedly lasted for more than two years, for a very simple reason, entirely because Wu Yi's attack was weak. However, this half-up, half-down situation made Lin Daping particularly painful. He struggled hard in disappointment, deliberately obliterating his spirituality, swallowing his anger and desperately grasping his original position, not daring to let go.</p>
<p>One year on Christmas morning, at seven o'clock, Wu Yi was still sleeping soundly and had not woken up when someone sent a package of gifts. It was an extremely beautiful彩盒 box. His servant said:</p>
<p>"The person who sent the things is still waiting downstairs, saying that he wants a reply."</p>
