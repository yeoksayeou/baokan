<p>時評</p>
<h3>兒童節獻詞誠</h3>
<p>今天是第二屆兒童節。是我國成千成萬的兒童們最可紀念的一天。也就是我國成千成萬的父兄們以及成千成萬負有幼穉敎育之重責者的敎師們。最應爲兒童幸福而深思熟慮的一天。</p>
<p>在今日之資本主義國家内。成千成萬之兒童。正與成千成萬之成人一樣。一爲富有家庭之﹁少爺﹂﹁小姐。﹂而另一則爲陷於飢餓寒冷狀態下無所依附之﹁流浪兒。﹂富裕家庭的兒童。在父兄蔭庇之下。食膏粱。衣錦繡。奴婢供奉。隨心所欲。有如﹁天之驕子。﹂在其小小心靈裏。絶不知人世間尚有痛苦事。另一方面的一羣流浪兒。則無食無衣。無所依附。在飢餓與寒冷慢性的侵襲之下。鳩形鵠面。書則出没街頭。夜則露宿巷尾。疾病與死亡。時時站在他們的前面。予弱小生命以極大的威脅。至於在農村中的貧苦兒童們其飢餓寒冷。也正與城市的流浪兒童一樣。而陜甘災荒之區。不幸的兒童們。更極多爲可憐的父母賤價拍賣。以博一飽。其尤慘酷者。甚至﹁易子而食。﹂將這一羣兒童。和上述富裕家庭的兒童相比較。恰爲一處天堂。一淪地獄。這地獄與天堂。則正是横在我們眼前的現實人間。</p>
<p>當然。彼日常在凍餒鞭笞下無知無識的流浪兒一羣。其最後的結果。自不外乎走上種種罪惡之途。爲破壞社會的炸藥。同時毁滅其自身。然而彼富裕家庭的兒童們。在父母的愛護下。在安逸的生活中。養成其依賴奢靡驕縱的習性。及其長大。率多爲紈袴子。爲無所知無所能徒知消費的蠧蟲。其結果亦終必走上毁滅之途。</p>
<p>在這兩種絶對不同的情形下。成千成萬的兒童。便是這樣的毁滅了。此一代如此。下一代還是如此。這一嚴重急迫的問題。竟無人注意及之。兒童何罪。我們認爲這種對於兒童玩忽的態度。實至殘酷。</p>
<p>而且兒童是國家的基礎。是民族的生命。兒童的毁滅。即無異於民族的毁滅。我們能夠對兒童忽視嗎。我們能坐視其毁滅嗎。</p>
<p>﹁拯救兒童。﹂在今天我們謹向政府全國的父兄和全國的負有幼穉敎育的敎師。提出這一要求。但尤其應該認淸的是拯救兒童。應該把兒童問題和整個社會問題聯繫起來。應該把兒童問題和社會制度問題聯繫起來。</p>

<h3>日本單爭動員之準備（一續）</h3>
<p>二工業動員</p>
<p>關於軍事工業動員的事、這是單就軍隊作戰的情形來說的、但是對於未來戰爭的輪廓如前面所說過的、兵員必定要比較日俄戰爭時增加的、並且軍需品又必需要更多、别一方面、打消國民的繼戰意志又變成將來戰爭的一種很大的交戰手段、所以單舉行了軍事的工業動員、對於將來的戰爭還不能算是完整的準備、就是在那個時候、應該要怎樣保障國民的生活、如果軍需品需要多量的材料、那麽民需品要怎樣設法纔好、當然在將來的戰爭必定和向來相同、日本人的愛國心、無疑的是不落人後的、雖說有食粟的覺悟、但是終歸非用最小限度來保障國民的生活不可的又原料材料、應從何處用何方法取之如何分配、對於陸軍所舉行的工業動員應該要供給多少資源、陸軍所希望的是這樣海軍所希望的是那樣另一方面商工部所計畫的又是一種、農林部所計畫的又是另一種、所以對於量的分、配實發生了很大的問題、其他在戰時要做這些事、又應該組織甚麽機關纔好、這也是非從平時計畫起來不可的、又對於情報、宣傳應怎樣設法、單要靠陸軍海軍、是不可能的、又金融財政究竟要變成怎樣、要怎樣設法、如是有許多事單靠軍需工業動員是辦不到的、這些關於政治行政的事、爲將來戰爭的準備起見、非在平時周密的計畫起來、就要陷入如歐戰時各國所嘗到的恐慌狀態的、因此就把資源局爲中心、來計畫總動員的事宜、</p>
<h3>三資源局的内容與組織</h3>
<p>資源局就是内閣的外局、是在昭和二年産生的、在資源局辦理關於日本國家總動員的準備業務、但是單靠資源局終究</p>
<p>是做不到這樣巨大的全體事務的、所以一定要把資源局做中心、使各部共同協力來做總動員的計畫、其他設有資源審議會、這是内閣總理大臣的諮問機關、擔任關於總動員的諮問、資源審議會以内閣總理大臣爲總裁、以商工大臣及陸軍大臣爲副總裁而以各部的次官爲委員、委員之數爲三十五名、這個總動員的任務不是單靠政府所能辦到的、其任務所到、雖至極細微的小事都非充分的準備不可、所以非設立和中央機關相對立的地方機關不可的、這個相當於地方機關的、現在　没有特别的獨立着所以在行政機關的各地方官　的内部設有處理總動員的準備業務的人、員關於資源局的内容、外間似乎不大明瞭的樣子、約略說起來、第一爲辦理總動員的計畫起見、須搜集其所必須的資料、要之、調查就是計晝的基礎、所以非切實的舉行調查不可的所以大體可以分成三種的任務、就是司調查工作者、處理計畫的實體者、和處理由計畫所産生的平時應做的事宜三種、從實際工作的人員來說資源局是不能容納那樣許多人員、所以用了極少數的人員來辦理的、因此由陸海軍及其他各部分派了必須的人員來辦理這些事的、這些人員就算是資源局的戰員了、就是由各部分派了人員到資源局來做職員、分擔各種的任務的</p>
<h3>四最初所舉行的國家總動員</h3>
<p>在歐洲大戰勃發當時、八月三日柏林有名的電氣會社的社長拉特那向德國的軍事當局獻策他初會見德國的軍務局長就在八月八日、所陳的策略就是說非由國家來施行不可、九日午前會見了當時的陸軍大臣、遂被採用以後德國就逐漸把國家機關傾向於戰爭方面、終於變成了現在的所謂國家總動員、以前德國的符力特里可大王時代也有過總動員、這或許可以說是總動員的濫觴、符力特里可說國民第一的義務就是盡忠於國家、這竟變成了德國的國是、因此德國的工業力和所有的國力得和軍隊的統御一樣健實的發達着、所以在歐洲大戰時、德國能比較順利的舉行了總動員、</p>
<h3>五美國參戰時的情况</h3>
<p>據說美國在參戰時、要完成全部裝備、費了相當的準備、這是不是因爲平時總動動員的準備没有完畢、同時我們也可以說法國也没有完備、英國也没有完備、各國加入世界大戰的時候、對於國家總動員的準備、可以說没有一國能完備的、美國之所以不加入戰線者、其原因正多、美國是個輿論的國家、所以在大戰勃發的當時、輿論界對於參戰的事不很活動、這樣的觀察法是不錯的、當時德國潛水艦對於敵國的汽船、施其無警告的沈擊、大施其貿易的破壞戰、被擊沈的汽船中有盧施太尼亞號乘着多數的美國人、同被擊沈而死、於是國民的輿論對於參戰達至最高調、這就是直接的參戰動機、普通都這樣看法、不錯、自戰爭爆發以至參加戰線、此間經過了兩年八個月、美國工業力的增進、和總動員的準備總算相當的告成了、參戰是在一九一七年的年初、此間準備了些甚麽、就是在一九一六年六月頒布了國防法、其内容就是說、政府得發出優先購買種種物件的命令、又有强制的使國民製造軍需品的條項、並且也有對於政府的購買價格非同意不可的條項、國防法中又寫着、要辦理四千萬元的硝酸蘇達的自給自足設備、並且也寫着、爲確實軍需品的準備起見、在大總統的權限内、可以組織工業動員的準備機關、就是把議會的權限移讓給政府、這樣的事就在一九一六年六月决定的、就是在戰前已經有總動員準備了、與其說是總動員、不如說産業動員較爲適當的、又在一九一六年末、開了國防會議、其中以陸軍·内務·農務·商工·勞働·等部長爲委員、而以政黨以外的民間各方面的有力者爲顧問、如是在戰前就已經有了所謂總動員的準備、無論甚麽時候參戰都是無礙於事的、這是的確的事實、並且美國所售給歐洲列强的軍需品是龐大的數量、所以我們可以說美國工業方面的實際的獨力是向上的、而其基礎是非常鞏固的、歐洲諸國所交納給美國的金額多至數十億、所以工廠也因而擴張、能力也因而遞增、這就是美國對於總動員準備的途徑、但是如果以爲美國因準備完備、纔來參加戰線的、這樣的看法、我以爲是錯誤的、（未完）</p>

<h3>中福兩礦糾紛與道淸路</h3>
<p>道淸路局長之負責談話</p>
<p>集作通訊、三月二十三日、道淸路有爲福公司運煤之火車一列、行至集作站、突有中原煤礦公司所派之小學生多人、到站攔阻、不許開行、此事眞象、外間多不明瞭、兹照錄道淸路局長范予遂談話如下、</p>
<p>（中福合作及福鑛停工）集作之中原煤鑛公司、與英商福公司、在民國十四年前、本採分産合銷辦法、營業參爲發達、彼時道淸路對於福公司外債本息、亦尚能按期償付、自上海五卅慘案發生、福公司因地方民衆之反對而停工、向之煤觔銷塲爲中原所獨佔、中原本可趁此機會儘量發展、惟因經營不得法、營棠反日就衰敗、自現任釐事長李文浩接辦以來、頗加整頓、去年十一月該公司開股東大會、所分紅利至二分三厘之多、惟實際上其所定紅利、並未分發、</p>
<p>（福鑛開工運動被挫折）中原公司、旣以營業不振不能吸收福公司舊有工人、又無力收買民窰所採之煤、致一部份失業工人、及以　煤或收煤窰地租爲生者、不得不要求　公司開工、同時中英邦交逐漸恢復常態、　公司乃積極作復工運動、經實業部及外交部允許後、實業部卽派員在開對召開會議、當時僅議原則六項、未有具體結果而散、此時中原公司當事與地方上一部分人士、固皆反對　公司開工者也、去年五月、余（范自稱）來長道淸路、曾晤中原副董事長、彼尚堅持反對福公司態度、並云贊成福公司開工者、皆爲帝國主義走狗、中原勢不與之兩立云云、</p>
<p>（中福會議及福鑛採煤）至去年下半年、形勢漸變、中原重要負責人、不再反對福公司開工、並願在相當條件之下與福公司合作、去年十月、實業部復派員召集中福兩方代表會議、中原提出合作條年十四條、福公司接受、經由河南省政府略加修正、呈行政院、又經行政院通過、於是中福合作之局始定、此經過之大慨情形也、因外交關係及中原之不能獨立發展、致福公司終於復工、此實中國鑛業之不幸、然其勢亦有不得不然者、</p>
<p>福公司得河南省政府之允許、於去年五月開工抽水、最初地方民衆頗有反對者、以有地方政府之保護、抽水之後、卽繼之以採煤、在去年七八月間、據云每日出四五百噸、去年年底、每日已出千噸以上財政部所屬之鑛稅處、因之收入亦見旺盛、此福公司採煤之經過也、</p>
<p>（福礦運煤經過及現狀）福公司自停工以來、數年之間、煤運未嘗停止、因該公司舊有存煤、用以维持其一部分之員工生活、並供給焦作市内之電燈自來水、故每日在本路各小站運銷約近二百噸、去年十二月中福兩公司代表正在開會、中原忽函請路局對福公司完全停運、理由爲正在商議合作條件、用以示難於福公司、以前在各方反對福公司之時、並未禁運該礦煤觔、在中福合作原則已定之後反欲停運、理由殊不可解、且該公司大量開採已成公開事實、財政部又已徵其礦稅、本路在奉到上級命令以前、何能遽爾停車、然本路爲維持中原營業計、雖經福公司再三抗議、仍僅允按照向例每日運三百噸、不予多撥一車、福公司因向本路交涉無效、又屢向鐵道部催迫、並以索還本路欠債爲對抗、及中福合作條件通過於行政院福公司對本路之態度益加强硬、嘗謂貴路旣展中央政府、何以貴政府允許採煤、又徵收礦稅、而貴路獨不許運煤、且貴路所角債務、有無償還之義務云云、本路一方受福公司之嚴重詰責、一方又奉到鐵道部籌還債息之命令亦以兩公司合作之條件旣定、而地各需要煤塊甚急、中原煤觔、則産量日减、不足以應其譜要、故於三月二十三日允許撥給一列車、猶不許運往外路及道口新鄉、於應付對外交涉之中、仍竭力維持中原銷路、</p>
<p>（福公司運煤車輛被阻）不料此一列車開至焦作、卽有福中小學之學生數十人、由敎員率領到站、阻止開行、同時李河車站有中原之礦工多人、及礦警三百餘人、持槍示威、亦有小學生數十人持棍排列站台、高呼口號、故福公司煤運遂完全停頓、</p>
<p>（道淸路對此所持態度）本路向來所持態度、如維持中原銷塲、靳予福公司車輛等等、亦無非擁護本國利益、限制外商活動、與中原及地方民衆所持態度、本無絲毫歧異、所以對福公司勉强應付者、因政府旣許其開工、又已抽收礦稅、路局在奉到部令以前、未敢擅負停運之責、今中原旣假民衆之名、强阻開車、則因此引起之一切責任、當然由中原負之、若中原能覓得妥善辦法、使本路不至以擅行停運見責於政府、更不至再受債權者之催逼詰責、則固中心之所欣慰、無不樂從、故自此以後、若非中福兩公司定有同意辦法、本路决不再爲福公司撥車運煤、</p>

<p>工潮起因時裝成衣業、爲新興之事業、該業在初創之時、工資頗大、大衣每件約五六元不等、嗣因工人日多、爲互相競爭起見、致有數次之减削、目下每件工價二元四角、小衣照八折計算、長大每件加二角、較之初創時已差一倍、去年十月、曾有一部份工人、自動怠工、相持約一星期、結果互訂條件、始行復工、然未簽字、近因華美等十餘家、竟欲再减致起此工潮、</p>
<p>昨日罷工昨日上午八時、工會以資方一再减削、曾於三月十七日致函西服　公會、要求制止、然迄今半月餘、未見答復、工方以資方無意和解、故卽聯合大新·新華·華美·美大·新豐·麗美·錦泰祥·華新·愛娜·一心·等十餘家工人二百餘人、自動離店、實行罷工、並擬呈　黨政調處、</p>
<p>資方表示據大新·新華·等負責人談、成衣工資、本不一律、如南京路鴻翔等、則工資較大、而同處福州路之各家、亦各不相同、有每件二元一二角至三元者、總以須視各家生意之大小而定、而今年則又不比往年、時勢如此、實亦各具苦衷、然各家亦有稍行增加、總得由時裝業同業公會之議决、方可一律實行、决不願獨異行止云云、</p>

<h3>農村裏回得去嗎？</h3>
<p>丨本埠雄聲君來信丨</p>
<p>現有一問題，請在貴欄内加以公開之指示，本問題雖然由我個人提出，但是，我十二分的相信這個問題實在是有很多數的人期待着你們的指示而給於像我這種人的境况者有所遵循，我想，不必拿事實說得太多，否則，佔去了寶貴的篇幅，寶在太可惜了，就是現在我是遭受着最時髦的病症，丨失業，過去因爲没有一技之長的原故，到現在感覺得找事愈無把握，並且已到了一個絶望之境，怎末辦呢，生存終是要生存的，丨犯法没有膽，自殺也鼓不起勇氣，事實上因爲上有老母下有妻小的緣故，也是環境所不答應，至於我的學問和才能，恐怕是你們所要知道的，但是慚愧得很，除了能寫這樣幾個字以外，是一點也没有了，不過，我倒並不絶對的怨怪自己，因爲根本上，這是現社會所造的現實，我當然逃不出這個公例，失業者要想不犯法而能生存於緊華奢侈的消金窟的上海，那實在比登天還難的一件事啊，一方面各機關商店都實行生産合理化的大批大批地裁員减丨，把許多人的飯碗打碎，另一方面呢，奢靡之風，日盛一日，消耗之習，大大增加，别說其他，就是房租地捐，也不絶增加，所增加都須我們平民負擔，失業者像我，固然，難以過日，就是勉强在做事，大半也在暗地呌苦，結果定必　重難返，勢必不能逃出此天羅地網，城市裏旣然無法生存下去，那末自然祇有回到農村裏去，（現在正有許多的人在高唱着這種　　）才是一個没辦法中的辦法，在理論家說來，固然是能够很動聽而能激起一部人的興奮的，（便是我也是其中的一分子）可是，困難的地方也是有的，回鄉村固然是我的願望，并且吃人血的魔鬼般的都市，没有甚麽可使我留戀的地方，我以爲早天逃出就是早一天得到幸福，不過回到鄉村去的時候，同樣地要裝飽肚子才不致發生恐慌，要是没有米飯來充飢，根本上也是無能爲也的，因爲我是一個十足無産者，在城市没有生産工具，到農村時也没有活命的技能，而且一間屋，半畝田，也是没有，的確可以稱之爲赤貧，試問這種樣子怎麽能够生存，怎麽能回去，上述是主觀上我個人没有回鄉去的能力，但是在客觀上看，整個鄉村是否能容納成批的被城市所擠出的失業者，農村經濟破産的呼聲，不但到處可以聽到，就在最實際的日常情形上，也可看到有很多很多的因爲遭遇着天災人禍的結果而不堪立足，便奔到城市裏來確非少　，單看中國目前各地差不多没有一省逃出兵亂，匪禍，天災的命運，良好的田地被大水所淹没而無力恢復耕種，房屋家財之被刼掠焚毁，田賦雜稅之重重抽剥，又其最主要的是各帝國主義的經濟勢力伸入到内地以來，竊　僻壤間也充斥着洋貨，把成千成萬的小手工業者完全消滅，這更是農村破産的最重要原因，總之，整個農村的本身都在無法維持，更何從來安揷外來的人，上述的情形，都是確實的，雖然我的文字太惡劣也决不能掩蔽其眞述情况，</p>
<p>最後，我所要求你們解答的，是像我現在所遭遇的境况，是不是能回鄉村，回鄉村時怎樣是一種最適當而又最可能的維持生活的方法，編者先生，萬望你們不吝指敎，因爲你們是讀者的顧問，望勿失掉你們的責任，</p>
<p>答，你所說的現社會的現象，只會比現實少，不會比現實多，當資本主義，尤其是國際資本主義侵入中國農村以來，一方面是農村日益破産、農村的人口之相對的過剩日益加甚，這些過剩的農村人口，一部分自然向着都市跑，所以就拿上海做比罷，今年人口已超出三百二十萬，另一方面城市的工業發展無論如何快，都不能消納此等人口，並且因資本主義的生産合理化的結果，城市的人口也日漸形成相對的過剩，總而言之，城市固然不易找到工作，即在鄉間亦難謀生，足下所說，確係實情，在這種情形之下，想回到農村去專爲謀生起見，那我們實在看不出什麽樂觀的前途，不但没有樂觀的前途，並且只有依然餓着肚子去做農村失業者，這問題（失業問題：城市的與農村的）不但在中國現社會的制度之下，没有解决的希望，即在素稱世界樂土的美國，（見本報二月二十日的紐約通信：美國農民的悲哀）都是日趨於破産，無法解除　自身的矛盾，據記者個人眼光看來，現在回到鄉村是没有把握的，至於說到﹁回鄉村時怎樣是一種適當而又最可能的維持生活的方法，﹂我們淺見，實在想不出什麽方法，不要說﹁適當的﹂方法了。然而讀者大衆也許會想到好方法的，特此把這個問題，鄭重提出，請大家想來。</p>

<h3>兒童節日之感想孔祥熙</h3>
<p>祥熙海外言旋，征裝甫卸，復有北邊前線慰勞將士之行，栗六舟車，不覺我可愛之兒童節日之忽屆，值此强鄰壓境，戰雲瀰漫之時，邦人士必有謂吾人應亟務其大者遠者，而忽視兹節日之舉行，祥熙於此竊有說焉，當普法戰後，德軍之凱旋也，俾士馬克顧其曹曰，吾人今日之成功，胥拜歷年小學敎師之賜，蓋謂彼忠勇克敵之戰士，皆自其少日陶鎔而來也，夫德人當日困屈於拿翁鐵蹄之下，正與我人之困於暴日相同，今我舉國上下，雖奮力以爲抵抗，而勝負之局，則仍未可臆斷，幸而勝也，固將冀我未來者發揚而光大之，設不幸而敗，尤不得不望其他日之洗恥雪恨，是今日之兒童與我國家之關繫，蓋非淺尠也，祥熙此次周歷各國，正值世界經濟恐慌之時，歐美列强，俱處危困，工商凋敝，各地皆然，平時雖各黨意見紛岐，而遭遇艱難，靡不犧牲團結，共支危局，此固由其政黨之能持大體，然亦賴其國民一致之促成，推厥主因，實繫於兒童敎育之普及，故人民於國家之觀念及己身之責任，認識甚眞也，當此國難方殷之際，吾人固當凛興亡之義，奮起以爲抵抗，而根本之圖，則敎育兒童以謀百年樹人之計，實其最要，誠不容忽視者也，兒童節日之規定，原由本會之呈准，經國府明令頒行，其舉行之意義及辦法，本會今年所刊手册，縷述詳盡，無待贅言，兹特抒其所見期國人之注意，俾我國慈幼事業駸駸而日上，國家之盛興，實利賴焉，</p>

<h3>兒童運動與民族前途</h3>
<p>丨兒童紀念節祝詞丨</p>
<p>上海市市長吳鐵城</p>
<p>中國古之治理，敎養兼施：育幼養老，夙所重視，誠以兒童有敏慧之天資，純潔之天良，活潑之天機：其智其德，其體，均在成人之上，誠能敎之養之，各得其方，自易蔚爲社會之長才，改進民族之質素。</p>
<p>近世各國政治革新之趨勢，對於人民生活之保育，備極注意：而於兒童生活，兒童權利，且予以憲法的保障。如戰後德國新憲，其顯例也，德憲第一二二條規定曰：﹁對於兒童之過勞，以及道德上，精神上，身體上之怠棄，當加以保護。聯邦，邦，公共團體，對此當爲必要之措置。﹂其次如一一九條及一二○條，又有關於家庭衛生，以及義務敎育之規定。至於各國勞動法典，對於兒童之保護，更爲周密，如工作年齡，工作時間，敎育程度，身體康健諸項，莫不於法律爲嚴密而特别的限制與愛護。吾國先哲對於兒童問題，初未漠視，如曰﹁男有分，女有歸，壯有所用，鰥寡孤獨廢疾者，皆有所養﹂又曰：﹁老吾老，以及人之老；幼吾幼，以及人之</p>
<h3>羣生有育林森</h3>
<p>幼；﹂其愛護兒童，注意兒童之精神，槪可想見。惜乎晚近以來，敎化廢弛，非但國家社會，漠視兒童；甚至身爲父母師長者，亦均不知其敎養之責任。羣居衆日，言不及義；行爲放浪，心身日壞。兒童爲將來民族之精魂，國家之基石，長此以往不加注意，則其所貽民族國家之患，何堪設想。</p>
<p>今逢兒童節紀念之日，適承徵稿於愚，因就公餘，略布所感。深望今之從事於兒童運動者，對於兒童心理，兒童敎育，兒童思想，兒童習慣，兒童道德，兒童身體，兒童生活，兒童衛生，兒童福利等，加以切實注意與研究，俾活潑，純潔，敏慧的無數兒童，均不致爲惡劣環境所腐化，而蔚爲國家社會之長才。則其有裨於民族前途者，何可言量哉！二十二年兒童節。</p>
<h3>今日之中國兒童潘公展</h3>
<p>在畸形的太過或不及的待遇之下，我們中國的兒童一向是被視爲一種珍奇的玩物或一種多餘的累贅，而不能獲得必要的自然的發展丨在生活的各方面，一切惡果，丨孱弱，懦怯，愚笨，自私，······丨都種因在這個時候，因爲做父母的在﹁非科學方法﹂的愛護（？）之下，其結果乃適與其預期相反；我們往下，其結果乃適與其預期相反；我們往往看到社會間許多兒童都萎縮在﹁少年老成﹂的狀態之下而失去了他們的潑剌的靑春的景象，這實在是極可驚嘆的一件怪事。</p>
<p>父母之愛其子女，原是必然的倫理。但，問題却不在于愛不愛﹂而在于﹁愛得對不對﹂·否則，因爲愛之不得其當的原故，往往反造成了惡果·丨所謂﹁愛﹂結果却變了﹁害﹂：害了兒童，同時又害及整個的民族。</p>
<p>誰也不能否認，我們民族在現在及未來所需要的戰士，正是强健的，勇敢的，理智的，能犧牲自己而爲公衆服務的靑年們·所以，我們對於兒童的敎育方面，就亟應用﹁科學方法的訓練﹂來克服過去的﹁非科學方法的愛護﹂。要保持兒童們的活潑　純潔的精神，要磨鍊兒童們的堅强與勇敢的力量。</p>
<p>一切對於兒童的溺愛，就是戕害兒童的毒素，也就是戕害民族的毒素·丨做父母的必須有充分的領悟。</p>
<h3>兒童節談李廷安</h3>
<p>嬰兒衛生與學齡前兒童衛生今天是中國第二屆兒童節的日子，乘此機會，來談談嬰兒衛生與學齡前兒童衛生吧。我們覺得一國國民之强健與否於其國民在兒童時代有極大之關係，蓋兒童尚在發育期中，如不運用合於衛生原則之種種方法以訓育之，維護之，則易天亡，即或幸免天亡，亦易成爲怯懦愚弱之人，非但不能爲國家社會服務，而國家與社會，反須支出若干之救助費用，故謀一國國民之强健，對於兒童衛生</p>
<h3>為兒童謀幸福乃成人之天職潘潘展題</h3>
<p>，必須特别注意而實行之。</p>
<p>兒童可分爲三階段，自出生以至一歲，曰嬰兒，自二歲以至應受義務敎育之年，（六足歲）曰學齡前兒童，自受義務敎育之年起曰學齡兒童，關於學齡兒童之衛生，係在學校衛生範圍之内，應由衛生機關與學校共負施行及指導之責，至嬰兒衛生及學齡前兒童衛生，乃重在家庭方面，而母親爲負責尤重之人，今日爲兒童節紀念日，爲特一述嬰兒衛生與學齡前兒童衛生，以促爲父母者之注意焉，</p>
<p>一嬰兒嬰兒在出生後之四星期内，尤易死亡，經過兩個月後，較爲可存，凡母體有病而生之嬰兒，非易死亦必不能健全，故維護母體之健康，爲保存嬰兒之唯一要遵，如母有梅毒，酒癖，慢性結核病，貧血等病者，則所生嬰兒，每致早産而甚至死，嬰兒恃乳爲生活，故於哺乳及乳質，尤宜注意左列各點，</p>
<p>（一）應於生後十二小時，開始哺乳，以後每隔三小時或四小時，哺乳一次，（夜間十時以後至翌晨六時可以停哺，）</p>
<p>（二）哺乳前應以百分之十之硼酸液，或已煑沸過之開水，將乳頭揩凈，哺畢，應將乳頭如法洗凈，倘有餘賸乳質，應即擠出，否則乳汁行將缺少，</p>
<p>（三）嬰兒吮乳，不可任其太速，以免發生嚥噎，如已嚥噎，可將嬰兒抱起，使腹部倚靠母體，而用手在其背部輕徐按捺，俟其胃部空氣吐，而已不噎時，然後再喂，</p>
<p>（四）嬰兒啼哭，並非祇爲索乳，應檢查衣服，有無束縛過緊之處，而無蚊咬虱叮，是否嫌冷嫌熱，</p>
<p>（五）嬰兒以本生母之乳汁最爲適宜，非必不得巳之原因，（如母患結核病，或患急性傳染病，或因乳房有離或又巳懷孕或患癎癲等，）不應使吮他人乳汁，或喂以牛及代乳乳粉等品，</p>
<p>除前述關於嬰兒食品方面，所應注意之衛生外，尚有應加注意者，</p>
<p>（一）一月未滿之嬰兒，每日應使睡眠至二十小時，一月以至一週歲，每日應睡眠十六小時，</p>
<p>（二）嬰兒於出生一週以後，即可抱至房外，，俾得接觸更爲舒暢之空氣，但須愼防過熱過冷氣候之猝襲，</p>
<p>（三）嬰兒宜常爲之沐浴，但須愼防受寒，　　（四）嬰兒之衣服，必須柔軟乾燥，坐臥之墊褥，如遇着潮，應速更换，</p>
<p>（五）滿月後即請醫生佈種牛痘，如遇天花流行之時，則出生二星期，即可請醫商酌種痘，</p>
<p>（六）嬰兒器官，均尚脆弱，凡狂笑怒駡及其他過劇聲音，惑恐怖現象，均足剌激其腦，故須保持安靜狀態，</p>
<p>（七）嬰兒口腔，每日應以百分之十之硼酸溶液，爲之洗淸，至乳齒發生時，尤須每晨每夜爲之洗淸，</p>
<p>（八）嬰兒往往因患氣管枝炎，肺炎，下痢及腸炎，痙孿，百日咳，及其他疾病而致夭亡，但非醫生不易察知，故宜常請醫生施行嬰兒之健康檢查，如遇嬰兒有不良現象，（如多哭及食量減低等情形）尤須速請小兒科醫生診斷，施以適宜之治療</p>
<p>二，學齡前兒童一歲以上而至應受國民義務敎育之年之兒童，其生存之保持，雖較一歲以下之嬰兒稍易，但因營養不良，先天不健全，並於疾病易於感受等原因，仍易天亡，故父母仍須予以妥愼之維護，並施行適宜之訓育，兹舉其槪要如次，</p>
<p>（一）在三歲以下，每日須有十四小時之睡眠，六歲以下每日須有十小時之睡眠，</p>
<p>（二）導以適宜之輕便運動，吸收通暢之新鮮空氣，並受日光照耀，但仍宜愼防過寒過冷氣候之猝襲，</p>
<p>（三）衣服臥具，不可潮濕，並常爲之沐浴，口腔亦須爲之保持淸潔，</p>
<p>（四）預防天花，每隔三年請醫種痘一次，（五）預防佝僂病，宜常使幼孩受日光之直接照耀，並於可能時，常喂以適量而含有丁種生活素之食品，（如魚肝油）及含有鐵質之物，（如蛋黄等）</p>
<p>（六）預防壞血症，於可能時，常喂以適量而含有丙種星活素之食物，如橘汁橙汁蕃汁菜蔬等，</p>
<p>（七）預防其他疾病，如白喉，霍亂，猩紅猩，流行性腦脊髓膜炎，流行性感冒痢疾等一切疾病，均須請合格醫生，施以適當之預防，及指導，</p>
<p>（八）請醫施行檢康檢查，遇有不寗現象，即爲醫治，</p>
<p>（九）養成良好衛生習慣，如（一）性喜淸潔，（一）飲食有定時，（一）勿食雜食，（一）每晨大便一次，（一）食前洗手，（一）拒絶不良嗜好，如烟酒及其他剌激物，（一）公正平和氣度，</p>
<p>以上不過略述嬰兒與學齡前兒童衛生之槪要，爲父母者，應體會而實行之，</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>文人無文</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>一　姓﹁大﹂的報的副刊上，有一位﹁姓乂的﹂在﹁要求中國有爲的靑年，切勿借了﹁文人無行﹂的幌子，犯着可詬病的惡縣。﹂這實在是對透了的。但那﹁無行﹂的界說，可又嚴緊透頂了。據說：﹁所謂無行，並不一定是指不規則或不道德的行爲，凡一切不近人情的惡劣行爲，也都包括在内。﹂</p>
<p>接着就舉了一些日本文人的﹁惡癖﹂的例子，來作中國的有爲的靑年的殷鑒，一條是﹁宫地嘉六愛用掐爪搔頭髮﹂，還有一條是﹁金子洋文喜舐嘴唇﹂。</p>
<p>自然，嘴唇乾和頭皮癢，古今的聖賢都不稱牠爲美德，但好像也没有斥爲惡德的。不料一到中國上海的現在，愛搔喜舐，卽使是自己的嘴唇和頭髮罷，也成了﹁不近人情的惡劣行爲﹂了。如果不舒服，也只好熬着。要做有爲的靑年或文人，眞是一天一天的艱難起來了。</p>
<p>但中國文人的﹁惡癖﹂，其實並不在這些，祇要他寫得出文章來，或搔或舐，都不關緊要。﹁不近人情﹂的並不是﹁文人無行﹂，而是﹁文人無文﹂。</p>
<p>我們在兩三年前，就看見刊物上說某詩人到西湖吟詩去了，某文豪在做五十萬字的小說了，但直到現在，除了並未預告的一部﹁子夜﹂而外，别的大作都没有出現。</p>
<p>拾些瑣事，做本隨筆的是有的；改首古文，算是自作的是有的。講一通昏話，稱爲評論；編幾張期刊，暗捧自己的是有的。收羅猥談，寫成下作；聚集舊文，印作評傳的是有的。甚至於翻些外國文壇消息，就成爲書界文學史家；湊一本文學家辭典，連自己也　在裏面，就成爲世界的文人的也有。然而，現在到底也都是中國的金字招牌的﹁文人﹂。</p>
<p>文人不免無文，武人也一樣不武。說是﹁枕戈待且﹂的，到夜還没有動身，說是﹁誓死抵抗﹂的，看見一百多個敵兵就逃走了。祇是通電宣言之類，却大　其駢體，﹁文﹂得異乎尋常。﹁偃武修文﹂，古有明訓，文星全照到營子裏去了。於是我們的﹁文人﹂，就只妊不舐嘴唇，不搔頭髮，揣摩人情，單落得一個﹁有行﹂完事。</p>
<h3>小學敎師（續）</h3>
<p>— H,Borbusse作李靑崖譯</p>
<p>自從這塲勝利之後，西班牙的敎士們，對於小學就施出了空前殘酷的壓迫手段，當時他們所倚賴的，是那個騰笑今古的王室；隨後又倚賴狄克推多的力量了。在這狄克推多的時代裏，軍官們都是國王，统治者都是敎士，於是就成了一個復古的國家，其中的敎士從四面八方開起倒車回到了從前的懲治異端的時代。而國内的那些大演說家，想使民衆相信自身從那有時效性格的進化律而漸漸自由漸漸有幸福，都難於立言。</p>
<p>所以這堂長以及那個像他影子般的堂副，痛恨這個太誠懇又太有獨立性的小學敎師，他愈富於同情心，他們愈視爲危險。然而，因爲他們在他的行動和議論之中，絶找不着一點實現的破壞性質，結果祇好另外設法去抓他的過錯。</p>
<p>在今日的不幸的西班牙，政府允許敎士們在學校裏面行走，目的就是要監視學校所施的敎育是些甚麽。</p>
<p>在我現在所談的這一天，這所村立小學的敎室在有人上課之際，牠的門忽然開了，於是那兩個穿黑袍子的人，就從那簇由門口射入的方形光亮之中，進了這間不大明朗的敎室。隨後他們蹲着不走，並且靜聽。</p>
<p>佐里鎭靜地繼續他那正在講授之中的功課。他詢問小曲尼多，而曲尼多因爲没有聽明白，所以有些不大好意思，祇得口吃地說：</p>
<p>丨丨公道······平等······</p>
<p>那堂長向前跨了兩步，立在這孩子跟前。</p>
<p>丨丨這是甚麽話？他怒氣冲天地問。曲尼多張皇失措了，張着嘴没有回答，他班裏有一個名呌魯尹次的十四歲的學童，素來成績最好，這次他想顯出自己巳經聽明了並且記牢了先生所說的，就立起來答話：</p>
<p>丨丨堂長老爺，世上的人都是平等的。</p>
<p>丨丨這句話不對丨那個穿黑袍子的人提起嗓子喊着，同時還跑過去，舉起拳頭伸到這個好學生的鼻子底下。這句話不對！這和宗敎主義的敎育是相反的。上帝從没有說過世上的人都是平等的，並且聖保羅用他的名義說過他們都不是平等的！</p>
<p>他高聲嚷着，額頭上的靑筋發脹了，口角邊的白沫集成許多小球了，這時候，那堂副用動作表示滿意，向天空舉起雙臂。</p>
<p>這位小學敎師沈着地前進。</p>
<p>丨丨請您允許我，堂長先生，他說。　　丨丨我應當允許您甚麽丨那堂長吼着。要我允許您說謊話嗎？允許您敎孩子們說謊話嗎？主張世上的人都是平等的，這就是宣傳一種被上帝所禁止的謊話，您聽明白没有？孩子們，聽我說：你們老師對你們說謊！（未完）</p>
<h3>論﹁新八股﹂</h3>
<p>— 祝秀俠</p>
<p>中國有許多事情，常常愛學﹁時髦﹂，本來﹁時髦﹂并不是不好的東西，可是，換湯不換藥的﹁時髦﹂，也就和﹁陳腐﹂差不多。尊臉的皮肉依然，縱使把﹁花臉﹂的臉譜洗去，改爲﹁靑衣﹂，到底尊臉原來的色相，也還一樣。所以，﹁時髦﹂并不是改名字，所﹁鈔票﹂呌做Mone</p>
<p>y，把﹁賤内﹂呌做Wife之類，便算Upto</p>
<p>date的。例如：男女相愛，古呌﹁通姦﹂，今呌﹁軋姘頭﹂，在一般摩登小姐少爺的嘴上，便呌﹁戀愛﹂。又如在一位戴着冕旒的皇帝，惟我獨尊時，呌做﹁專制時代﹂，而現在幾位皮帶要人的作威作福，便呌做﹁民主政治﹂，字眼果然不同，可是，換了﹁湯﹂没有換﹁藥﹂，細細想來，還不是那一樣東西！</p>
<p>談到文壇，﹁新學者﹂自然是要愛﹁時髦﹂了。雖然他不一定懂得音樂，但他的文章裏常常說怎樣受﹁梵啞鈴﹂的感　，（我不信胡琴，二絃就不能感動）！雖然他可以在文章裏完全寫中國字，但他總歡喜揷上幾句外國文。不過事實上，自從胡適老博士提倡新文學運動反對用典，反對用死話（八不主義）以來，那些舊八股雖然﹁革﹂去了，但新的﹁天足﹂却如何呢？糟糕得很！﹁天足﹂仍然被另一種纏脚布纏住了。謂予不信，且看新舊八股的對比：</p>
<p>（舊）某生，風流瀟洒有文才，與某小姐花園相會，由贈金，中狀元，至大團圓。</p>
<p>（新）某學子，性的苦悶，無出路，輿某摩登女子花園弔膀，由亭子間，同居，離異，至　泊。</p>
<p>（舊）且夫天地之間。</p>
<p>（新）啊！這個空虚的宇宙。</p>
<p>（舊）嗚呼，吾愛！</p>
<p>（新）哎唷，我親愛的人兒！</p>
<p>（舊）孔子曰···孟子曰···詩不云乎···誠哉是言也。</p>
<p>（新）康德說···蒲力哈諾夫說···三民主義裏面不是說過嗎？···這是很對的。</p>
<p>這個對照，不是有意地來弄成的，實在是順手拈來。這豈不是一個﹁革面﹂而不﹁洗心﹂的新八股的出現嗎？我也頗敎過兩年書，最討厭的就是學生迫我出小品文題目，因爲，做出來的東西，全是一些爛調舊語，無病呻吟，眞比﹁吃臭鴨蛋﹂還難。可憐一般中學敎師總歡喜呌十﹂五六歲的孩子去寫些﹁深秋的落葉﹂呀，﹁月夕的悲哀﹂呀那一類的東西，并且訂明小品文</p>
<p>長篇創作</p>
<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他不知道該到什麽地方去了。</p>
<p>到後來，他在一家廉價的旅館裏歡了一衣。</p>
<p>第二天早上起來，他仍然是思念着鶴子夫人，全無心緒到學校裏去。他想，向她的父親道歉也可以，只　能够回到她面前去。他好幾次都想走回她家裏去。不過一想到她的父親還住在她家裏，他的脚步又艱　起來了。</p>
<p>﹁自己睡在床上，鶴子夫人坐在床沿上和自己談笑，那是何等令人開懷的事喲！住在她家裏不單有種種精神上的安慰，並且一切起居飲食也非常舒適。從昨天起，自己便感着許多物質上的痛苦了。﹂</p>
<p>從旅館出來，他想只有老曹那裏可以不用客氣。還是先到他家裏去再作商量吧。他悔恨不該衝動地打了那個日本佬。不然，自己此刻還住在鶴子夫人的家裏，不是蒙着被窩在酣睡，就是坐在案前寫文章了吧。李一香先生不是答應爲自己的作品設法出版麽。</p>
<p>他一邊想，一邊走，不覺走到大世界面前來了。仰起頭來望了望紅錫包香烟廣告塔上的大時鐘，十點十二分了。道時候，他看見一輛光可以鑒的包車從八仙橋那頭向着這邊駛來。當他看見坐在那包車上的性時，他的胸口怱然又悸動了一下。</p>
<p>﹁那不是卓淑華麽？她何以頭髮那樣鬆亂，臉色也那樣的蒼白；她像剛起身，還没有洗潄呢？﹂於是他想起了她的住家的情形，便想像到她的鬼秘的生活。在他的心頭，又多起了一覆懊惱。</p>
<p>﹁密絲卓！﹂</p>
<p>他禁不住呌了聲。但是那輛包車很快地跑過去了。他想，她一定看見了自己，才背過臉向那一頭去，當做没有看見的。天下那有這樣没人情的人呢。</p>
<p>﹁算了吧。她又不是你的什麽人。何苦自尋類惱！﹂</p>
<p>他雖然這樣想着，但總不能打消自己對於她的關心。想像到她的墮落的生活，似乎對於她的責任又加重了一層般的。他這時候的心裏實在像敎會裏的僞善的宣敎師，存着一種主觀和偏見，以爲唯有他是得進天堂的人，至於跪在他面前的慕道者盡都是有罪的，只是切望着他的感化和拯救。</p>
<p>想到這裏，他又有點自愧。他想，自己實在是太不自量力了。</p>
<p>走到曹世光家裏來時，只見世光抱着小孩子坐在一把矮竹椅上，滿臉的不高興。</p>
<p>﹁啊，你來了。請坐。﹂</p>
<p>世光的臉上半點笑容也没有。看他的神氣，是十分的懊惱，不像平時一看見海泉就滿臉笑痕了。</p>
<p>是要抒情的。（大槪尤以悲思爲尚﹂！你想，這麽一個小孩，除去想看電影，想打打球之外，有什麽屁心情可寫。結果一開首又是﹁啊！這個空虚的宇宙···﹂罷了。有一等文人，專以抄書見長，一動手就是某某說過，括符號内，引了一大段，於是某某如是說，某某如是云，自己的文章便做起來了。而且顯然的是又長又可以賣弄淵博。其實，這種﹁準轉載﹂式的大文，這種﹁綴百裘﹂式的大文，不過是一些﹁嘉言鈔﹂而已。</p>
<p>這諸如此類的﹁新八股﹂，也非打倒不可。</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>十二予之阿Ｑ哲學</p>
<p>二十年前，易白沙先生授吾輩以六書，於黨字云：﹁黨，不鮮也：從尚，從黑，尚聲。黨尚秘密，則不鮮明：黨多黑暗，則不鮮潔。﹂維時袁黨用事，齮齕民黨，相持不下，海内騷然。先生傷時感事，語係有爲而發，不勝感喟，聞者動容。予年方幼，頗以能文自高，大爲同學所忌。同學中有所謂﹁靖港佬﹂者，行則成羣，止則成黨，忌予尤甚，專與爲難。譏訕侮辱，無所不至。諡予以醜惡綽號，如陳死人，老八股，算命先生之類，在十數以上，至今舊友相逢，猶資爲啁笑。彼時予亦崖岸斬絶，愈自矜異。及聞易先生之說，因而憶及孔子之言，乃取不黨名齋，自居君子，而以羣小待人，横逆之來，作揖而已。受侮不辱，犯而不較，一若别有勝利也者，此阿Ｑ式之勝利也。一九二七年春，予爲女子師範學校國文敎師，一日講授唐詩新選，至寒山子詩：</p>
<p>豬吃死人肉，人吃死豬腸。豬不嫌人臭，人反道豬香。豬死抛水内，人死掘土藏。彼此莫相噉，蓮花生漲湯。</p>
<p>我見百十狗，箇箇毛　　；臥者渠自臥，行者渠自行；投之一塊骨，相與啀喍爭；良由爲骨少，狗多分不平。</p>
<p>一女生閱讀巳畢，起而言曰：﹁先生，此二詩妙極，此非象徵異黨相爭，同黨亦相爭乎？﹂予爲之瞿然改容，默然無語者久之。迨託跡滬上，以此二詩刊於名剌之背，惟投遺極少，獲者彌珍。並以豬乎狗乎名齋。遵海濱而處，頗有遁世旡悶之意。繼而深會老子黑雌之說，復易齋名曰不爭，自謂天下莫能與之爭，怡然自得，殆將終身焉。此亦阿Ｑ哲學也。</p>
<p>蘧廬先生曰：予之生平，嚴師畏友多矣，懼於予之爲人有重要之啓示者，易先生與某女生巳耳。二十年來，予爲社會無用之物，莊子所謂彼以生爲附贅縣疣者，吾其斯人之儔歟？易先生旣蹈海以自殘其生，某女生亦不知遯跡何所。世變日亟，民生益艱。魯難未巳，魯其無鳩，可慨也夫！</p>

<p>兒童節專號</p>
<h3>童子時代</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>童子時代是光彩初生的時代。但看形容朝暉，總說旭日瞳瞳，我希望全國童子，都和瞳瞳的旭日一般，漸漸的吐露出光輝來。只爲，瞳字裏面，包含着一個童字。</p>
<p>童子時代，是聲譽乍起的時代。但看，中國的樂譜，首先發聲的是鐘，最後收聲的是磬，這便呌做﹁金聲玉振；﹂我希望全國童子，都和首先奏樂的鐘聲一般，漸漸的﹁聲名洋溢乎中國。﹂只爲，鐘字裏面，包含着一個童字。</p>
<p>童子時代，是最易印入外界印像的時代。但看，人的全體上最易印入外界的印像，便是這一對瞳子；外界來了聖賢，瞳子裏便印人一位聖賢：外界來了惡魔，瞳子裏便印人一個惡魔；我希望全國童子，都把古今的模範人物，時時的印人他們的瞳子裏面，而萬萬不要和惡魔接近。只爲，瞳字裏面，包含着一個童字。</p>
<p>童子時代，是最易因脫離規範而發生危險的時代。但看，陸行有陸行的規範，要是，不按照着行車的時刻表，那麽，兩車相撞，便容易發生出軌的危險；水行有水行的規範，要是，不按照着羅盤指示的航線，那麽，船隻和礁石相撞，便容易發生沉舟的危險；我希望全國童子，都把逐日的修養功夫，和行車時刻表一般重視；父兄師友指示你們的良好俓，又須知羅盤指示你們的航海路程一般看待；那麽在你們童子過程中，便可避免一個最易發生的撞字危險。只爲，撞字裏面，包含着一個童字。</p>
<h3>大雹中的小英雄</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>南非洲常常是落大雹雨的地方，去年有幾百隻鶴，爲大雹雨打死。那一日，有三個孩子，大的年十一歲；次的九歲；幼的祇有六歲，在羅司登伯爾村的附近郊外遊戲。怱然如雞蛋大的大雹落下來了，三孩看看四面没有可以隠避的地方，假如冒了大雹雨逃回去，有兩三里的路，勢必要都被大雹打死。其中年長的那個孩子，人極勇敢，急忙的呌那年幼的兩孩，俯臥在地上，他自己伏在兩孩的身上，以爲庇護。這時候雹雨的勢很大，那年長的孩子被雹打得遍體鱗傷，但是他忍痛不動。等了一會，雹雨停後，他方始站起來。那年幼的兩孩，幸得他的庇護，安然無恙，然而他自己已受傷甚重了，像這樣勇敢的孩子，我們實在可以欽佩吧。</p>
<h3>讓孩子們多吃水菓</h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>長熟的水菓，聰明地利用，是富於使身體内一切酸類中和的維他命（或稱生活素）和無機酸鹽的。假如已長大的孩子多吃天然的長熟的水菓，代替了那種對於消化器官毫無用處食品，或竟使消化機關過度工作，去製造不</p>

<h3>未來的英雄</h3>
<p>— 易易</p>
<p>無論是早上，無論是下午；無論是暖天，無論是冬日；整天的，在這一條弄堂裏，有許多的失學兒童，在熱閙地很有興味地生活着！</p>
<p>有的，在小便處的旁邊，打着彈子；拿了一粒粒小而圓的晶體，在地上劃了一個方形的格子，用手來彈着，或是打着！彈中的，就是勝利，再可以打，赢得對方的彈子！有的，就拖了長長的鼻涕，在旁邊看着！</p>
<p>有的，互相謁駡，大家打起架來！</p>
<p>有的，在轉糖的攤邊，轉着泥菩薩！把一個個鋼板，交給那個小販，轉一轉，得一片糖！</p>
<p>有的，在猜糖的攤邊，抽着一張對的圖盡，就可以得着一盒陳皮梅，或是一包花生糖！</p>
<p>有的，在擲骰子的攤上，擲骰子；赢得三次的，就可以得到一碗長生菓，或是一隻爛橘子！</p>
<p>有的，在小攤子旁吃着什麽在小火爐上烤過的東西！</p>
<p>有的，··················</p>
<p>當我每一天經過這一條弄堂，我總是看到這一般失學的兒童，是這般地在熱閙的生活着，熱烈的賭博着！</p>
<p>唔！咱們的同胞，原是都歡喜賭博的呵！</p>
<p>你如果到一個朋友家裏，不論那一天，他們總是會三缺一的等待着你！那時，你也總會不得不的來他四圈吧！是的，這畢竟是有了賭博的成人，然後才有賭博的兒童！但是，啊！中國未來的英雄，就任他們這般下去吧？</p>
<p>有一次，我漫步的跑進了一個一二八戰蹟的展覧室，於是，我便在那裏發現了一種使我們驚怖的影象！我看見有許多日本的兒童，寫給日本第九師團裏的一個士兵的信；那士兵，無疑地是一個小學敎師；那些信上，大意是這樣的說：﹁我們的乂乂乂先生，講給我們聽一個英雄的故事；那英雄，是奮勇的殺死了許多支那的兵！支那兵，實在是最可惡的；我們將來要踏上支那的國土，把那些支那的人，個個殺死！到那時，我們要高呼着萬歲萬歲！我們要替我們的天皇報仇！我們是虔誠地祈禱着我們大日本帝國的皇軍勝刹！我們是等待着我們的壯士凱旋而歸！﹂</p>
<p>有的又說：﹁上海不比滿洲的冷吧﹂？</p>
<p>啊！我的熱血流在一起，我祇是默然！</p>
<p>回來的途上，我是想，咱們的未來英雄，是在小弄堂裏，小便處旁，垃圾箱前，在賭博着呢！</p>
<p>吧。</p>
<p>讓孩子們在間一天的早晨吃水菓以代殻類，食品，假使晨餐不給水菓，那麽在午餐後，一定要給以長熟的水菓。其實成年人吃水菓，也有莫大的好處，最顯著的功效是打倒便秘，使面色紅潤，氣質淸爽，兩頰有顔色，眼睛更有光彩，所以水菓不但可以淸腸滌胃，醫治疾病，並有滋養的價值。</p>
<p>﹁蘋菓天天吃一隻，醫生永遠用不着，﹂確是有趣味的經騐談。但是據一位醫生告訴我說，﹁所吃的一定要長熟的蘋菓。所以在園裏有未曾全熟的水菓的時候，最要當心，否則孩子們吃不到熟的，便去吃生的，那麽要破費你醫藥費了。</p>
<p>兒童棋譜阿絜</p>
<p>啓發兒童的智慧，鼓勵兒童的興趣，除摺紙，组紙，泥土竹木手工，石膏製造的菓物，花燈，紙蔦等製造外，要推﹁兒童棋﹂爲最了。﹁兒童棋﹂方法簡便，又含了比賽性質，很配兒童的胃口；所以和上說的各種手工游技，都是有關於﹁幼稚敎育﹂的要件啊。現在海上各書店對於﹁兒童碁，﹂不過只有三五種，如動物棋，海陸空戰棋之類；豈知民間關於﹁兒童棋﹂是很多的，現在來舉出二種，請負兒童敎育責任的先生門，大家來注意這類兒童游戲吧！</p>
<p>（一）糞坑棋如下圖，正方形中各交點，爲各白就應該趕快找尋出來一條生路。</p>
<p>不要因窮困趨入下流，</p>
<p>更不要做一個懶惰的狗；</p>
<p>要曉得我們有萬能的雙手，</p>
<p>做點事業出來呀：</p>
<p>也好塞住譏笑辱駡者的口。</p>
<p>全世界流浪的孩子一齊怒吼。</p>
<p>宇宙間的悲哀可以化爲烏有。</p>
<p>全世界流浪的孩子一齊動手。</p>
<p>地球上的海洋可以塡成平土。</p>
<p>孩子們快起來向創造的路上走！</p>

<h3>齋藤進退兩難</h3>
<p>日聯三日東京電齋藤首相訪問西園後、日政局將有如何變化、據貴族院各派有力者之觀測、大槪如下、議會終了後、首相訪間元老報告諸事、爲近年之慣例、然今次齋藤首相之訪問西園寺公、因其内閣與政黨内閣之形體不同、又内閣之重職高橋藏相無熱心、其他首相内相等亦缺緊張、故與普通爲議會報告之訪問稍不同意義、首相及藏相等雖希望政權復歸政黨、然首先回復政黨之信用最爲緊要、現内閣似於編成預算前、處理五一五事件、然後在適當時期掛冠、故不如政友會或民政黨所希望早將倒閣、又不如民政黨之熱望内閣繼續長命、</p>
<p>日聯社四日東京電國聯同盟以齋藤首相之訪問西園寺爲内閣總辭職之前提、現正頗重視首相之言動及政局之推遷、國内觀察齋藤訪問西園寺目的、除報告議會經過外、探究元老對於政局之眞意、議會可决未曾有之大預算後、政府對於經濟財政之善後、及退出國聯後外交問題之責任非常重大、然現内閣無拾收時局之熱意、又無能力、故政府黨之政友民政兩黨合作之實、漸次破綻、政友會徒望政權之得手、而民政黨主張現内閣之延命主義、内閣之倒閉、成爲時期之問題也　　電通四日東京電齋藤首相今晨九時邀高橋藏相到首相官邸、詳細報告訪問園公之内容後、謂園公以當此時局重大之際、始終勸余繼續担任、余亦希望藏相爲國留任、共負重責、高橋藏相約以考慮而去、結果高橋藏相或將訪問園公、又首相於九時邀小山法相到官邸爲同樣慰留</p>

<h3>美國與菲利賓獨立（紐約通信）（三月二日）</h3>
<p>美國關於菲利賓﹁獨立﹂的草案、其目的在於在菲利賓羣衆中造成混亂狀態、在於對美國農民有所﹁援助﹂、蓋自農民表露不安逸的鬭爭意志後、美國政府總得替他們想點法子、但其實、這個草案是帮助國家城市銀行（NationalCityBank）及其古巴糖業墾植家以及美國某部分關係人的、</p>
<p>草案給美國以繼續統治菲利賓軍事·商業·財政·司法和外交全部之權、草案不但照舊保留着現在的統治、並且更擴大現在的統治、更促進菲利賓經濟生活之破壞、爲﹁獨立﹂之代價、</p>
<p>草案規定﹁獨立﹂、是在非利賓立法機關或立法機關所任命的機關、批准了這個草案以後、草案批准之後規定憲法草案的條例也通過了、再經過一年、然後在馬尼剌召集憲法會議、憲法須於兩年限期内呈交美國大總統、如果美國大總統不贊成這種憲法、便將憲法發回繼續編製、如美國大總統接受了、則於四個月内在非利賓實行民衆投票、表决憲法、投票結果、如果是否决的話、則現時美國軍政部屬下的統治、自應持繼下去、若是贊成的話、那就可以在一個月内規定新選舉、於三個月至六個月内實行選舉新政府的官更了、</p>
<p>選舉結束後、便是十年的試行時期之開始、十年後非利賓便﹁獨立﹂了、但在這十年期間内、美國大總統對於非利賓之外交、外國公債、對外貿易、國内僑民、幣制等等都有充分的决定權、所有非利賓立法機關所通過的法令都必須送美國國會批准</p>
<p>菲利賓立法機關一通過獨立草案之後、菲利賓人之移居美國者、每年只以五十人爲限、稍後且完全禁止菲利賓人移居美國、美國應保留没收財産、審查法庭判决、保護菲利賓政府、保障生命、財産和個人自由之權、美國應保留着陸軍根據地和軍港、每一菲利賓人應忠實　美國菲利賓軍官應執行盡忠於美國的宣誓、國債應服從美國國會所定的限制、對於宗敎、慈　　關和敎育機關不准收稅、美國團體和美國人民應受同等的權益和同等的待遇、學校中應用英文敎授、宗敎間的寛容應有保障、</p>
<p>自試行時期開始之日起、自由貿易應告停止、每年八五○○○○噸以上的糖的出口、二○○○○○噸以上的椰子油的出口、三百萬磅以上的苧麻和絲的出口應實行課以規定的稅則、菲利賓政府對於此種不收關稅的物品、應自第七年上起、課以百分之五的出口稅、自第十年上起、應課以百分之二五的出口稅、</p>
<p>我們現在把美國國會此種活動之經濟的基礎來研究一下、這裏首先是古巴糖業關係人、他們靠國立銀行的帮助、與反動農民團體聯成一氣、他們都想驅除菲利賓糖的競爭、</p>
<p>富農和銀行家所支配的團體也是菲利賓一獨立﹂的擁護者、種糖·種烟草·以及種别種物品的富農、都願意借菲利賓﹁獨立﹂除去菲利賓的競爭、</p>
<p>美國改良派總工會、因爲希望遠離菲利賓人和一切亞洲工人的緣故、同樣主張﹁獨立、﹂自然、他們關心於工人和貧農羣、</p>
<p>衆的事件、是不如關心於帝國主義老板的願望之深且切的、</p>
<p>胡佛且反對此種對菲利賓似是而非的讓步、他曾指謫此種草案、預料此種草案必引起菲利賓﹁政府的崩潰、他說結果﹁爲避免未來爭端之很嚴重的危險起見、爲避免美國與他國戰爭的發動起見、必將有軍事行動、以防衛其他勢力之深入、或以之維治境内秩序、﹂他說、菲利賓全國經濟生活、一完全以對美貿易之便利爲憑藉、﹂美國現在是以菲利賓總收入之百分之三八、　那兒菲利賓及美國海陸軍的經費的、他深慮一紙獨立的宣言、已足以削弱美國在遠東的威權、</p>
<p>若對菲利賓經濟基礎加以研究、更不難知道、這個草案是准備毁滅菲利賓經濟的、菲利賓全部貿易差不多都是對美貿易、現在旣實現各種限制和礙障、便是有意破壞此種貿易、一九○九年輸出額爲一千四百七十萬美金、一九二九年一萬二千四百五十萬美金、一九三○年一萬零五百萬美金、其中輸入美國者實佔五分之四、照美國商務部長Chapin的估計、如果一九三○年巳實行預定關稅的話、輸出額之輸入美國者、當減少百分之六四、﹁紐約泰晤士報﹂一記者估計、菲利賓自由貿易一終止、輸出額之輸入美國者、當減少六千六日萬美金、由美國輸入菲利賓的輸入額、當減少五千七百萬美金、美國在菲利賓所投的資本九千七百萬美金中、當減少百分之八三、</p>
<p>菲利賓商業旣有很大的障礙、將來必感受鄰國及鄰近殖民地競爭的痛苦、菲利賓糖行將不能在世界市塲上與爪哇糖或古巴糖競爭、菲利賓椰子油爭不過錫蘭椰子油、菲利賓烟爭不過蘇麻達剌烟、</p>
<p>由此可知所謂﹁獨立與眞正的獨立、完全是另一回事、不是菲利賓民衆所要求的、菲利賓勞苦羣衆要求的是、即時獨立、完全獨立、撤回美國的軍隊和戰艦、取消一切關稅障礙和移民條例等等、</p>
<h3>日本計劃大規模開採熱河礦源</h3>
<p>熱河省藴藏鑛産資源之富、爲全中國冠、十數年來、日本早卽垂涎、惟因當時權操於國人、日人無法過問、自日軍强佔東北後、日人卽認熱河爲其惟一生命線、蓋日人深懼於退出國聯後、經濟爲列强封鎖、欲與列强抗衡、非急據熱河不可、以是日軍復施其蠻横手腕、熱省遂被其强佔、查熱省面積大凡一萬一千方里、已墾之地、僅佔百分之二·三、除森林外、大部爲山嶽東連松嶺山脈、西接陰山山脈、其間所藴藏之金·銀·銅·煤全部埋藏量、共計十二僮噸至二十億噸、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>﹁臥底﹂﹁漢奸﹂與﹁發酵作用﹂</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>小時候看舊小說每逢大破盜寨，或是豪莊的時候，輒有所謂﹁臥底﹂一法，先着人去詐爲投降，於是裏應外合，一鼓而擒，未嘗不感到這是一個制敵的巧妙辦法。，</p>
<p>夫所謂英雄也者，原含有﹁能屈能伸﹂之意，要當大難而無懼，丨鎭靜丨臨小節而不拘丨如廉恥之類，﹁臥底﹂的人，雖受一時的屈辱。，但終握到最後的勝利。，英雄是不失其爲英雄。，</p>
<p>一自俠義小說絶作，此義也竟成絶響，但從﹁九一八﹂以後，所謂﹁漢奸﹂者興起，於是而恍然此風尚在於人間。，名稱雖微有不同。，意義原無二致。。</p>
<p>因了一般人對於苦心孤詣的﹁漢奸﹂不加諒辭，以爲甘作亡國奴，於是感到知人論世之難，歷史是不斷的、舊的滅亡，便是新的誕生時，你能說救國的先覺與成功者。，不是此輩。？</p>
<p>當蒙古人的鐵騎踏進中國來的時候，我們便有一班歌功頌德的人，滿人入關也是如此，但到現在，你能找出蒙古人的威風與撻虜的遺響嗎？﹁將欲取之，必先與之。﹂這是中國哲學的粗髓。，﹁硬幹﹂又何如﹁軟幹﹂。。</p>
<p>在化學上，有所謂﹁發酵作用﹂，這方法，在中國更能普遍的運用，不但製酒造醬用得着。，於救國上更有大作用。。這是老於中國的外國人！，如莫理遜之流。，便可證明打破敵人的堡壘。，﹁臥底﹂固然是個好方法，但雖有﹁裏應﹂，所貴還在乎有﹁外合﹂，手續頗是麻煩，未免美中不足。，於是而﹁漢奸﹂尚矣。，</p>
<p>﹁漢奸﹂的作用。，就在使敵人發酵。，用作術語就呌做。﹁誘敵深入﹂。。於是再放一點﹁麻痺﹂。，﹁苟安﹂等等中原文的出去。丨我們是不少這些東西的。丨也就夠醉倒鐵騎。，打翻木屐。，旣無須乎﹁裏應﹂。，更不必求﹁外合﹂。兵不可血，而河山依然是我們的。，豈不是法之至善？所可惜的這一班功成不居的志士。，於歷來的國史是失傳了。，只留下幾個比較知名的如洪承疇史天倪輩。，這是將來修民國史時所應注意的。。</p>
<h3>關於﹁航空救國﹂</h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>﹁一二八﹂以後，國人深深的受了一個大敎訓，知道在現代的戰爭中，没有飛機，全軍就好像盲人瞎馬，不但看不見敵人的軍情，而且要遭受到敵人所施極　　　怖和威脅　﹁一二八﹂之戰，我軍所極感的痛苦，誰能說不是没有飛機的原故？</p>
<p>最近熱河失陷，長城一帶又極受敵機的壓迫：我軍陣地爲其毁壞，民房被其轟炸，而敵機在天空中很安祥地飛來飛去，轟東炸西一任其獸性之所欲丨因之全國都撤底省悟了飛機在現代戰爭中的重要，於是全國動員，高呼﹁航空救國﹂丨只說上少一隅，没有多少時日，巳募得了很大的捐欵丨如果全國均　上海，　知一年之機，﹁靑天白日﹂徽的飛機當能高　天空與敵機相角逐而取得最後之　　也。</p>
<p>惟有諸事當此﹁航空救國﹂呼聲高震雲霄的時候，謹提出以爲當局告者，即爲（一）機師的訓練，（二）設廠製造自己的飛機，（三）製造自己的汽油。去年廣東飛機及杭州航空學校飛機的失事，飛機焚毁，機師慘斃，最近，粤飛機又以﹁飛機撞山被焚，飛行員二人同葬烈熖中﹁聞（詳見三月二十一日申報廣州通信）丨像這樣的飛行，與兒戲何異？徒浪費飛機與生命耳丨所以﹁航空救國﹂聲中，亟亟待先决者，當然是飛行人員的訓練，要使飛行人員像汽車司機一樣衆多，而且還要精幹靈敏！</p>
<p>關於飛機與汽油的來源，如果盡單單仰賴外國的供給，而自已不設廠動工自己製造，這個無底的大漏巵，將流出何等大量的金錢啊！換句話說，與其拿錢向外國去買，不如乾脆些各人把各人願捐的欵子送給外國人去！這，不特﹁航空﹂難以﹁救國﹂，甚且會産生新的更大的危機來丨然而話又說回來了，我不是喪心病狂來宣傳大家不要捐錢去買飛機，更不敢鼓吹拿錢白送給外國人，不過是說要想﹁航空﹂眞能﹁救國﹂，就是要有技術﹁成熟的飛行員來駕自己的﹂飛機，燒﹁自己的﹂汽油！否則，我還是要說：﹁將會産生新的更大的危機來！﹂</p>

<h3>過閘北</h3>
<p>— 虞和欽</p>
<p>憶昔孤軍夜被圍，心儀蔣蔡想英威，奪門妻子倉黄散，衝陣頭顱絡繹飛，我立危樓頻髮指，適逢狹路正刀揮，頽垣墮棟今猶昨，百萬生靈何處歸，百工居肆蔚成市，一炬兼旬化作烟，壇域階鼯羅夜月，靑燐白骨亂蕪田，攘夷有志鬼應泣，拓土無功師已旋，猶憶前軍生死急，廟堂戎服正談玄，</p>
<h3>戀愛的時候</h3>
<p>— 張一萍</p>
<p>春已降臨到人間，雨絲中吹來了芬芳的氣息，枝頭的小烏轉動牠們如簧之舌，唱出美麗的歌聲：整個宇宙，充滿了活躍的空氣。各大商店的大减價旗布，飄拂在春風之中。都市的少女，換去了重裘的大衣，穿上薄質的旗衫；靑春的炎燄，已在她們内心燃燒。靑年們的心弦上，彈出春之神啊，你帶給我們什麽？一年前的砲聲，再不停留在每個活躍的心中。這是一九三三的開始，上帝啊，正是我們戀愛的時候！</p>
<p>南京路的晚上，從電影院歸來和到跳舞塲去的汽相交替。狂歡禮拜六，享樂比較容易在記憶之中；就是行人道上也擁擠着各式都市動物，春已降臨到人間，正是我們戀愛的時候！從每個微笑的臉上，隠約飄過這樣的歌頌。</p>
<p>每輛電車駛來，落下許多人，同時被别的候補上。春的空氣中，處處散佈活躍的現象。賣大晚報的孩子，也跳着輕鬆的脚步，在人叢中喊出﹁熱河大戰！日本人吃敗仗！﹂的呼聲。五枚銅元的代價，翻翻有否强姦五歲幼女的新聞，日本人吃敗仗！一看過大標題後，望着跑前去的孩子背影微笑，好像說：﹁你會做生意，﹂旁的没有什麽表示丨本來僅是五枚銅元代價，何况有柳葉眉下的媚眼注視着，每輛電車駛來，落下許多人，同時被别的候補上。</p>
<p>大玻璃窗前佇立着人頭，後的想搬向前去，前的不准搬過來，於是每一秒鐘發生一次大騷動，人頭疊着人頭，人頭傍着人頭，像狂風暴雨一樣的時候，送來一個有挺直制服的三道頭　波動的人頭，一陣春風似的吹散了。</p>
<p>玻璃窗内是一個穿結婚禮服的少女，手搶提着慴縫的下擺，美目盼兮　對每　注視的人微笑。襯在立體的背景中，使春的氣息，更形活躍。那三道頭也，貪婪的注視着。</p>
<p>少女，正是戀愛的對像，結婚，正是戀愛菓實，春已降臨到人間，正是戀愛的時候的火燄，引動了觀衆的Attraction。三道頭消逝之後，玻璃窗丨母寗說穿結緍禮服的少女，又被更多的一羣圍上了。</p>
<p>寶大晚夜報的小孩，忘了他的職業，他雖没有這樣的夢想，但他也有靑春的火燄，他的火燄也能燃燒，所以他的頭也像普通人一般看着，看着說不定他正在希望於到一筆飛來大欵，把萬衆屬目的少女，攫進他的懷裏。</p>
<p>春已降臨到人間，上正是我們戀愛的時候！</p>
<p>一年前的砲聲，再不停留在每個活躍的心中，然而第二次的砲聲又在另一個春的空氣中激盪。沉醉在春的迷夢中的朋友，醒來吧！你們從玻璃窗中換一個方向看看，我們還有戀愛的時候嗎：</p>
<p>平等待遇？</p>
<h3>圍巾</h3>
<p>— 仁國</p>
<p>丨裝飾品丨</p>
<p>住在上海的人，誰都知道這裏的東西是特别的，無論衣着等類以及各樣東西，莫不與别處逈乎不同，丨因爲上海較别處爲摩登化，</p>
<p>現在就拿圍巾來說說，本來圍巾大都是羊毛織的，或用絨線結的，他的功用是防禦冷氣吹到頭頸裏去，但是現在有一種圍巾，不是羊毛織的，也不是絨線結的，却是絲織的，潤澤有光，但是在現在仲春的天氣，寒暑亦在六七十之間，却還可以看得見富家子弟圍着這種圍巾，豈不把這種圍巾做了裝飾品嗎，但是我不懂他們在這樣熱的天氣，還圍了圍巾，有什麽好處，不如掛幾張鈔票在頸上，表示表示富鹽之意，啊！眞是﹁窮人無飯吃，富人慊飽﹂。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我覺得時代已經轉變，現在的工商界，已非僅用十九世紀的經營方法所能勝任的了。我們眼看着其他任何個國家的工商界，如飛般進步。而我們呢？依舊照着我們祖宗所傳授給我們的老法子，如蝸牛般爬着。</p>
<p>現在已有很多工商界的人們，早覺悟到新的商業智識的飢荒。如新式的會計學，廣告學，市場貿易，統計學，科學管理，以及種種新的高深的工商智識。但是我們也覺得有一件很痛苦的事，就是我們從那裏去學習，那裏去得到這些智識呢？我深信此種專門學問，斷非買兩本書來看看就能了解的。一定要有專家指導，始能明白。</p>
<p>我也知道上海有一個國立商學院，一個滬江大學商學院，都可以供給業餘的職工們研究較高深的學問。可是他們所用的書本，十之八九却是英文本。那些對於英文没多研究的，祇好對之望洋興嘆！還有，最奇的，而且最不能使人了解的，就是他們何以要把入學資格弄得那麽嚴：一定要有中學畢業文　一始</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>能應考。没有文憑的，即使有同等學力，也拒人於千里之外丨於是像我　　因環境關係，未曾讀到中學畢業的，便永遠休想再求些高深的知識了。他們所以要文憑的緣故，無非藉以考察學力的夠不夠。不夠恐怕對於聽講没有益處。但對於失學靑年之有同等學力而没有文憑資格的人，眞不應該拒絶參加入學考試的呀！</p>
<p>工商界的店員，職工，渴望求些高深高業智識的，一定很多很多，與我同樣地位，抱同情的想也不少。先生，你們對於這個問題，有没有相當的辦法呢？</p>
<p>另有一件事：我覺得﹁業餘﹂的讀者們，在業餘的時間，如能互相通信談談任何一切問題是很有益處的；并且也是業餘的最好消遣方法。我很想得到這種切磋之益，很願意諸位讀者與我通信的。希望先生能把這封信及我的通信處披露出來，大家討論一下。</p>
<p>我的通信處是：上海新閘路一四○弄十五號。敬祝</p>

<p>乂乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>編者按：江君所提起的兩個學校，的確是上海業餘研究商業上高深學識的頂好所在，他們的課本，所以要用英文要子；據我們推想起來，不外下列兩個理由。</p>
<p>（一）没有適當中文本子，事實是這樣的，比較高深些的商業書籍，用中文寫的，實在太少了。</p>
<p>（二）因爲英國在事實上，還執着世界商業的牛耳，所以習高級商業的人，同時有習英文的需要。但是我們以爲第二點的理由，並不十分充分；即使有願習英文的；應該另設英文科。第一點的理由，目下確得有力；我們希望有學　的　　尤　是這兩慣學校裏的敎員，應當把這些書，譯出來，以解决這個困難。至於入學資格，一定要有中學文憑，原是鄭重的意思。不過江君所說的痛苦，也是實情，希望在可能範圍内，加以變通。江君這兩層意思，大可直接向他們請求。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（二十續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>﹁這是什麽意思啊﹂？他忍不住就要來一個﹁面斥莫怪﹂了。</p>
<p>﹁老實給你說，親愛的老兄弟﹂丨趙千里的一張最近才發胖的肥臉上，透着很驕傲，很鄙薄的冷笑。﹁我們以前確曾做過一番朋友，不錯，你來找我帮忙是應該的：可是目下我旣不再有和你繼續做朋友的需要，將來更不必和你再發生什麽友誼，換一句話說，就是我在你們上海的新聞界裏，已認識了幾個比你更有力量的人了，你所能給我盡力的事情簡直是没有了！那我一樣請一位秘書，不能敷衍别人嗎？所以，我願意利用我的地位，化相當的代價，向你收回往日的友誼。達克透伍，我說話向來是最爽快的，你大槪不致於生氣吧？﹂</p>
<p>伍逸像一頭受了創的獅子一般的跳將起來，眸子裏噴出烈焰一樣的怒火，前胸不住的起伏着，如果此刻他有一支武器的話，他眞要不顧一切的演出流血的悲劇來了。</p>
<p>﹁她！我謹以十二分的誠意，恭祝你子子孫孫，生生世世，永遠做大中華民國國民政府財政部的會計司司長！﹂不能動武，氣却不可不出，伍逸便含着一種反常的笑容，鞠躬而退。</p>
<p>（十一）嫂嫂</p>
<p>趙千里所給與伍逸的敎訓，倒使他澈底的大覺大悟起來。從此，他棄絶了一切的妄念，像小河裏的水一樣安靜地繼續的努力於他固有的職業，白天敎書，晚上進報館；閒的時候，就在家裏抱兒子。丨丨其時，他夫人劉素貞女士已給他生了一個很壯健的兒子了。</p>
<p>﹁在中國，越是眞肯讀書的人，便越是没出息；徼倖我當日還不是常考第一第二名的脚色，不然連這碗飯怕也吃不成咧！﹂伍逸逐漸認識了中國社會的眞面目之後，不但不因他自己並不能像别個博士一般的飛黄騰達而悲憤怨尤，就是趙千里林大平兩位老朋友的﹁人心大變﹂，他也很原諒，認爲這是﹁現代朋友﹂的常態；但是他對於社會的認識愈眞，膽子便愈小，他知道自已這樣一個尚具三分熱血的未開化人民，要免氣，要貪生，要吃太平飯，唯有實行閉門謝客的政策。這政策一經實行，伍逸便立即變爲魯濱遜式的上海人了，不但一切普通朋友完全斷絶往來，便是那碩果僅存的老朋友王玉麟，也漸漸地疏遠了。</p>
<p>﹁今天晚上，無論如何，請你上我家裏來！﹂某一年的龍舟競渡節的午後，玉麟忽然打了一個電話給伍逸，說話很急迫而興奮。﹁老伍，好歹來走一趟，這事情是跟你自己有很重大的關係的，别忘記了！我們是乂乂邨十六號，記着！﹂</p>
<p>劉女士因爲跟玉麟的夫人毛菊芬女士是同學的緣故，倒時常往玉麟家裏去走動，而伍逸却始終不曾去過，他和玉麟說話，總是在玉麟的學務所裏；因此，玉麟在電話裏，特地又把自己的住址說給他聽一遍。</p>
<p>﹁啊！好一處幽靜的所在！﹂當晚打過了六點鐘，伍逸已從自己家裏到了玉麟所住的乂乂邨的弄口，這裏是上海著名的住宅區，離車路很遠，幽靜得像鄉村一般，短短的鐵欄，保護着翠玉一般的靑墓地，連空氣似乎也淸香了許多，伍逸不覺脫口而出的　美起來。</p>

<h3>幾對著名的老撘擋</h3>
<p>— 神</p>
<p>譬如你看足球，籃網，以及其他一切的比賽，有良好的搭擋，完善的合作精神，是最使　者興高彩烈的。銀幕上亦然，兩個技能與經騐良好的演員，搭擋在一部影片中，更能因相互問的陪襯，發揮他們各個人的個性，風格，扮相與技巧。</p>
<p>在銀幕上，最著名的老搭擋當然是因﹁七重天﹂而成名的珍妮蓋諾和却爾福雷。雖然有一時期攝製者深恐他們各自結婚，影響到他們的出品。但他們的恐懼幸而没有成爲事實，﹁天香國色﹂，﹁第一年﹂﹁情濤﹂等片都没有影響。如今因爲福雷的脫離福斯而這搭擋拆散了，銀幕再也不能有他倆連袂的出演，我們是多愴痛地抱憾啊。</p>
<p>希佛萊和珍妮麥唐納，也是銀幕上老搭擋了。從劉别謙導演的﹁璇宫艶史﹂她倆亨了不可一世的亨名之後，派拉蒙的重視她倆，也正和福斯的對待珍妮蓋諾與却爾福雷一般。最近的﹁風月今宵﹂又是他倆的合演品。至於他倆的扮相，希佛萊是一熱男子的興型，而珍妮麥唐納是宜於富貴嬌奢的角色的。</p>
<p>最近著盛名的搭擋，恐怕要推﹁節育問題﹂的吉姆士鄧和莎麗媛鸞了。吉姆和莎麗同是生長於紐約的。吉姆已二十八歲，莎麗比他小三歲。他們都曾當過臨時演員，但，吉姆曾一度在舞台上表演。莎麗到好萊塢時是一九二六年。最初她是在百代滑稽片中當主角。可是從﹁舞侣﹂之後，没有聽到福斯把她們合演影片之消息，像﹁寛街臘艶記﹂和﹁賽珍會﹂（此兩片均未到滬）前者是吉姆主演而後者祗有莎麗的踪跡。</p>
<p>另一對新發現的搭擋是愛琳鄧與潘脫夏勃林，他們並不很著名，可是在他們初度著名的作品MarriedinHaste中是很成功的。</p>
<p>男與男的搭擋中，我們最深知的當然是勞雷與哈雷。此外第一國家的賈克霍與勞夫葛雷佛，他們是專着力於友誼的描寫的。華納裴士德與埃德門羅，一個是專門飾風流强盜而一個是專飾警察的。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評賽馬艶史SWeepstakes</h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>導演手法靈敏表演尚佳</p>
<p>本片的本事爲一賽馬騎師，年靑力壯，常以奇術致勝。轟動一時，頗爲有閒者所歡悅。同時，戀愛一女。其後因敗於敵，乃心灰意懶，終因女之勸慰，而得勝利，並與女成家室。</p>
<p>說到導演的技巧，他的手法是很靈敏的。他運用簡潔的方法，叙述故事，使我們在這樣平庸的題材中，也不覺得如何討厭。譬如那少年騎師在女處被敎師捉回而令其自屋頂爬進臥室，我們便可知道他原來先是這樣逃出來的。有許多笑料穿插得也很自然，如敎師在樓下打嚔而少年却在樓梯上應聲跌下。導演運用鏡頭也很奇巧。剪接亦佳，使全篇不失繁亂而能留着精采。</p>
<p>至於表演，那少年EddieQuillan的動作是很活潑可取的。當他在衆人喝采聲中，是那樣興奮而不知所措，在臥室内沉醉在自己的光榮中，這些地方都很逼眞而流露出他聰明。</p>
<p>配角中，以飾那敎師的表演最佳。雖然他應當拿出比較莊重的身份，但是亦不爲反覆的滑稽笑料所破壞。其餘諸人均平庸之至，特别是那位中國同胞，固然在劇中他本來就只是給觀衆笑笑而已，然而他那呆笨的動作也就委實可笑。</p>
<p>但是本片的取材和用意，却是毫無可取而卑劣的。我們看吧，一個騎師因爲能夠騎馬，便博得人們的喝采和器重，而且還嬴得了一個美人。同時，我們相信女人們確是具有特殊魔力的，似乎低何男人都應當在女人的誇獎或作弄中而勇敢盡力。我們想吧：這便是本片所要﹁敎育﹂我們的一切。至於編劇者爲什麽要拿賽馬來做題材呢？爲什麽多少更爲重要的現實生活都放棄不睬？而採取這樣敎人墜落的資料呢？眞是所謂以電影爲游戲了。不過這樣的片子是可以獲利的吧？因爲這是有閒者所最愛看而覺得津津有味的。原來美國電影便僅僅是快活林影業公司發行﹁荒島野人記﹂中之徐素貞現在中央大戲院開演</p>
<p>他們的娱樂品，他們所需要的也便是這種東西。</p>
<p>所以看了以後，我又覺得美國電影確實是臨到了它的末運，至於演出技巧，在美國也應當有這樣的成績。</p>

<h3>Situation in Eastern Luan Becomes Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>(Luanzhou) The war in eastern Luan is in full swing. At noon on the 3rd, an enemy aircraft dropped a document over our frontline headquarters, no less than a humiliating ultimatum, demanding that our troops quickly withdraw from the eastern Luan area or change allegiance, otherwise face the consequences of artillery fire.

A detachment of enemy scouts north of Qinhuangdao He Kou was driven back by our guards. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) From the 31st to the evening of the 1st, as a result of the enemy troops' bombing of Shimen Village, we abandoned the positions at Shimen Village, Shi River, Liu River, and the coal mine, and concentrated on the main positions in the areas of [missing text], [missing text], [missing text]. This morning, approximately a brigade of the enemy gathered around the Yiyuan Kou garrison camp, appearing to be preparing to attack our main positions.

In this eastern front battle, casualties on both sides were relatively high. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese second phase of operations involves occupying our army's Shi River positions in eastern Luan to threaten our troops defending the passes of the Great Wall. The reasons for their focus on eastern Luan are: (1) Reinforcements for operations at Xifengkou and Lengkou are difficult and have suffered major defeats. (2) The enemy has scouted our defenses in eastern Luan for a long time and is relatively familiar with them. (3) The enemy intends to occupy eastern Luan as a base for future third-phase operations to invade Pingjin.

We demolished it and also cut off the railway in the Gaoxinzhuang area to prevent the enemy's artillery train from rushing into our positions. After midnight last night, we began a counterattack against the enemy under cover of darkness. There was fierce fighting at Changqiao Ridge, Huaye South, and other places. Our army's counterattack was very successful. As of 3 AM this morning, fighting was still ongoing. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

After 10 PM, our Wang's army attacked the enemy at Changqiao Ridge from Anmin Village via Zhoujiagou.

A certain division commander personally led over five hundred infantrymen to the rescue, and only then was that unit saved. At 4 PM, the enemy again attacked our Shi River right wing with a portion of its forces, while at the same time using over ten aircraft to constantly bomb our army's positions.

<h3>Stretchers Insufficient for Evacuating the Wounded</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen said that due to the insufficient number of stretchers, wounded soldiers were transported back from the front line using large carts, resulting in great suffering for the injured soldiers over the distance of over a hundred li. Only upon arriving in Luanzhou could they be transferred to the Beining Railway train for treatment in the rear. The enemy has failed to conquer Lengkou after repeated attacks, and sends four to eight aircraft every day to reconnoiter and bomb our positions. There is no major contact between infantry. Our fortifications are solid, and we also have adequate anti-aircraft defenses. There is absolutely no cause for concern. Our army has now established contact with Xifengkou. Unless the Japanese increase their infantry force significantly, they will not dare to advance lightly. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

Our side suffered over a hundred and sixty wounded soldiers. Our army was still advancing on the night of the 2nd.

To facilitate military transportation, the enemy has recently been seizing civilian laborers to rush to repair the roads. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The main force of the enemy at Xifengkou mostly moved towards the Shimen Qin line. A regiment of enemy cavalry arrived at Dalingkou outside Xifengkou and attacked our positions.

According to those who fled back from the front, the enemy's main force of approximately six to seven thousand men has been repeatedly frustrated since attacking Jielingkou, suffering heavy losses, and has withdrawn to Dushan to regroup, presumably with other plans to achieve its imperialist aggressive goals. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy outside Xifengkou is now concentrating and reinforcing towards Cuancheng again, appearing to be planning to counterattack Xifengkou. Yesterday afternoon, three enemy aircraft went to the Xifengkou area to reconnoiter and drop bombs. Our side suffered no losses.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Ji returned to Nanjing from Xinxiang on the morning of the 3rd and consulted with key figures in the central government. According to Zhang, the enemy's intention is to encroach upon the key areas of Chahar and Suiyuan in Inner Mongolia, bringing the land outside our Great Wall under their control, and then look south towards Pingjin. Although we have increased our defenses in eastern Chahar, the future depends on whether the soldiers on the front line and the entire nation can show a united determination to resist. There have been no major battles at the various passes along the Great Wall recently. Even when there is contact, it is the enemy's strategy to contain our rear. The enemy's recent plan is to obtain Chahar and Suiyuan as their greatest objective. The way to save the country and resist insults is one, armed resistance, and two, economic boycott. If these two can be carried out simultaneously, it will have a considerable effect. The enemy's invasion of our country is also proceeding with both military and economic measures. Occupying the three northeastern provinces and Jehol is a military invasion. The dumping of Japanese goods in China, making it impossible for our domestic products to develop, is an economic invasion. Therefore, to prescribe the right medicine for the ailment, these two things must be implemented. But it is even more necessary for the military and politics to unite with the people, so that the whole country is of one heart and one mind, then the national crisis can be broken. Warlords raise troops for self-defense, do not go to the front line to resist the enemy, and instead prevent the people from defending themselves, which is enough to hinder saving the country. I will report this matter to the central government and make plans for fundamental national salvation. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shen Honglie, summoned by Chiang, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 3rd. At 10 AM, he went to the military academy to meet Chiang and reported on something. He is scheduled to meet with Wang in the afternoon and is expected to stay in Nanjing for a week before returning to Qingdao. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shen Honglie said that Qingdao is currently stationed with six companies of army and navy, responsible for maintaining law and order. The troops stationed in Shandong Province have long been prepared for maritime affairs and are able to cope with them. The warships under his command are stationed at Tanggu, Qingdao, and other key ports. If the enemy invades, we will do our best to deal with them. As for the Japanese navy establishing a headquarters in Changchun this time, on the one hand, they are doing so in the name of the puppet government, managing the Songhua River defense of the river defense navy and eagerly seeking to deal with Russia. On the other hand, they are ruling the port of Lushun and enriching the puppet's coastal defense to facilitate our use of troops. In fact, the puppet government has no defense forces to speak of. The enemy warships on the Songhua River were destroyed during the defense against Russia in the 18th year of the Republic of China and only a few merchant ships are equipped with a few cannons. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shen Honglie, commander of the Northeast Fleet and mayor of Qingdao, arrived in Beijing today on the order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He met with Chiang at 10 AM and talked for about two hours.

The questioner further inquired about his opinion on the establishment of a Japanese naval station in Changchun. Shen said that the puppet state is completely controlled by the Japanese military authorities. The establishment of the naval station this time is entirely aimed at Soviet Russia, because Japan is eager to extend its power into the Songhua River and improve the Lushun seaport for naval use. Shen also said that the Chinese sailors stationed in Qingdao are strong enough to maintain local law and order. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Matsuoka Utters Manic Delirium Again</h3>
<p>Speaking to Japanese Residents</p>
<p>Saying Resorting to Force Should Know Where to Stop</p>
<p>Chicago: Yosuke Matsuoka, former chief delegate of Japan to the League of Nations, will stay in Chicago for two days and explain Japanese foreign policy this afternoon. Matsuoka has already stated that he is absolutely not qualified to speak on behalf of the Japanese government. Matsuoka addressed the Japanese residents here, saying roughly that we must know where to stop when using force. Japan hopes to reach a compromise with China. If the European and American countries no longer interfere, then a compromise should be possible. Assisting the government of "Manchukuo" in achieving stability and seeking welfare for the people is certainly our duty, but the people there have been troubled by the strict laws of dictatorships until now. The task we have undertaken is not easy. Regarding Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, Matsuoka believes it is regrettable and said that when he bid farewell to the League of Nations General Assembly, it was the most depressing day of his life.

<h3>Sincere Words for Children's Day</h3>
<p>Today is the second Children's Day. It is the most memorable day for the tens of thousands of children in our country. It is also a day when the tens of thousands of fathers and elder brothers in our country, as well as the tens of thousands of teachers who bear the heavy responsibility of early childhood education, should deeply consider the happiness of children.</p>
<p>In today's capitalist countries, tens of thousands of children, just like tens of thousands of adults, are either "young masters" and "young ladies" of wealthy families, or "street children" who are trapped in hunger and cold without any support. Children from wealthy families, under the shelter of their fathers and elder brothers, eat rich food, wear fine clothes, and are served by slaves, doing whatever they please, like "favored children of heaven." In their small hearts, they have no idea that there are still painful things in the world. On the other hand, a group of street children have no food, no clothing, and no support. Under the chronic attack of hunger and cold, they are emaciated, appearing on the streets during the day and sleeping in alleys at night. Disease and death constantly stand before them, posing a great threat to their weak lives. As for the poor children in the countryside, their hunger and cold are just like those of the street children in the city. In the disaster-stricken areas of Shaanxi and Gansu, many unfortunate children are even sold cheaply by their poor parents to get a full meal. The most cruel thing is even "exchanging children to eat." Comparing this group of children with the children of the wealthy families mentioned above, it is like one is in heaven and the other is in hell. This hell and heaven are precisely the real world before our eyes.</p>
<p>Of course, the group of ignorant street children who are constantly subjected to cold, hunger, and beatings will inevitably end up on various paths of crime, becoming explosives that destroy society and destroy themselves at the same time. However, children from wealthy families, under the care of their parents and in a comfortable life, develop habits of dependence, extravagance, and arrogance. When they grow up, most of them become playboys and parasites who know nothing, are incapable, and only know how to consume. Their end will also inevitably lead to destruction.</p>
<p>Under these two absolutely different situations, tens of thousands of children are destroyed in this way. This generation is like this, and the next generation will still be like this. No one pays attention to this serious and urgent problem. What is the crime of children? We believe that this negligent attitude towards children is truly cruel.</p>
<p>Moreover, children are the foundation of the country and the life of the nation. The destruction of children is tantamount to the destruction of the nation. Can we ignore children? Can we sit idly by and watch their destruction?</p>
<p>"Save the children!" Today, we respectfully make this request to the government, the fathers and elder brothers of the whole country, and the teachers of the whole country who are responsible for early childhood education. But what should be especially recognized is that saving children should link the children's problem with the entire social problem, and should link the children's problem with the social system problem.</p>
<h3>Central Government Actively Prepares for the Provisional National Congress</h3>

<h3>Speech at the Central National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Ye Chucang Reports on the Significance of the Provisional National Congress</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Says Political Innovation Must First Eliminate Foreign Troubles</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 72nd weekly memorial service for the Premier at 8 a.m. on the 3rd, attended by Ye Chucang, Ma Chaojun, Jing Hengyi, Jiang Zuobin, Fu Rulin, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Zheng Zhannan, and staff members, totaling more than 500 people. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. Because Wu Chaoshu left Beijing, Ye temporarily gave the report, mainly saying that the Standing Committee passed the proposal last week to convene a Provisional National Congress in July and to advance the National Assembly. The Central Government's decision was not to seek a way out due to difficult circumstances, but to be full of positive spirit and seek a solution. Therefore, it had to be studied in detail and solemnly decided by the highest authority of the party. In the future, not only can the strength of the party be strengthened, but also the people can have a sound organization to express the public opinion and strength of the people. That is, all political powers and functions have unified norms and are convenient for application. If everyone understands this point, they will know the positive spirit of the party. The meeting adjourned after the speech. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a weekly memorial service for the Premier at 8 a.m. on the 3rd, attended by Wang Zhaoming, Yu Youren, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Zhang Daofan, Zeng Zhongming, Peng Xuepei, Chen Shuren, Wei Huai, and staff members of the National Government and the Executive Yuan, totaling more than 600 people. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and President Wang reported, saying that what could be reported recently was the Central Standing Committee's resolution last week to convene a Provisional National Congress on July 1 this year. At that time, the date of convening the National Assembly will be decided. In recent years, outsiders have often criticized the party. In fact, those who harm China today are: (1) foreign troubles; (2) communist disasters; (3) military hijacking of politics. From now on, we should show the people a new spirit and seek a thorough solution to the foreign troubles of enemy countries. We can use this to save ourselves. To seek political innovation, we should first eliminate foreign troubles. To eliminate foreign troubles, we must rely on diplomatic power, and diplomacy must rely on military affairs to have a way out. The success of military affairs still depends on financial support and domestic stability, such as preparing for local autonomy and consolidating basic organizations. The mutual connection is like this. It is especially hoped that the entire nation will assist the government to achieve success. We can only follow the Premier's instructions and seek a way to build the country from diplomacy, military affairs, finance, and internal affairs. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Military Organs Hold Expanded Memorial Week</h3>

<h3>Peng Xuepei Talks About Border Affairs</h3>
<p>Inner Mongolia Independence Is Not a Fact</p>
<p>No Reports of Conflicts in Qinghai-Tibet</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Peng Xuepei, Director of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Department, said that the central government has not received reports of rumors of Inner Mongolia's independence and the establishment of a Mongolian puppet state. It is thought that it is still an enemy's attempt to sow discord. The government treats both Inner and Outer Mongolia equally. Outer Mongolia has been independent for many years, and the government is always thinking of recovering it, but there must be a way to deal with Inner Mongolia, and then Outer Mongolia can be made to return. Regarding the war between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama in Tibet, recently, because the Dalai Lama has a sense of remorse, the two sides will reconcile, and the Dalai Lama has expressed his welcome to the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet. The Panchen Lama is also preparing to return to Tibet. From then on, the relationship between Tibet and the Central Government should gradually improve. As for the saying that there was a war in Qinghai-Tibet, the government has not received a report, and the representatives of the Qing Province government have also strongly denied the matter, which shows that it is a rumor.

<h3>A Certain Important Person in the Judicial Circle Pays Attention to the Sexual Desire Problem of Prisoners</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person in the judicial circle said that it is currently planned to imitate the prison system in Europe and the United States and stipulate that prisoners under the age of 25 and over the age of 15 should perform one or two hours of military gymnastics every day so that they can take up arms to defend against insults after being released from prison and exercise their bodies while in prison. After the Ministry of Military Administration and the Ministry of Supervision and Prisons participate in their opinions, it can be implemented in prisons across the country. Also, according to theory, the sexual desire problem of adult prisoners is that people commit crimes and lose their freedom, but sexual desire is not among the things that are deprived. Civilized countries in Europe and the United States have prisoner holidays, that is, those who have just entered prison are admitted to the assessment prison to investigate their criminal psychology and behavior. After a period of time, they are transferred to the advanced prison. After reaching the advanced prison, they can apply to return home for five or seven days each year to solve their sexual desires. After a period of time, they are transferred to the preparation for release prison and can apply for seven or fourteen days of leave each year. Our country is currently studying it. If there is a proper method, it can also be implemented in the future. (Special Telegram on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Four-Power Pact Plan</p>
<h3>French Government Declaration of Acceptance After Britain Proposes Amendment</h3>
<p>Forming a Ruling Group with Britain, France, Italy, and Germany</p>
<p>Negotiating to Maintain European Peace for Ten Years</p>
<p>Small Entente Nations Must Not Be Threatened</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd - After a lengthy meeting yesterday between French Ambassador to Italy, Yvonne, and French Foreign Minister Peng Gu, the Ambassador released a statement to the press, roughly stating that France has accepted the idea of forming a European ruling group with the four major powers of France, Germany, Italy, and Britain. However, France believes that small countries must not be threatened. Recent plans disclosed to the outside world, said to be the Rome Accords, are not the actual agreements. He has brought back from Rome the responsible intentions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. This move is crucial to avoid misunderstandings and guarantee ten years of peace in Europe. The so-called guarantee of ten years of peace means that the countries concerned should use this idea to negotiate with each other, rather than using it as an excuse to harm neighboring countries. According to reports, since Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon spoke in Rome, the above remarks are the first key points released by the French side.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd - The British Ambassador to France yesterday submitted a document to French Foreign Minister Peng Gu, stating that Britain has amended the plan previously submitted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to British Prime Minister MacDonald in Rome. What is contained in this document is the British amended plan. According to French newspapers, this document is a completely new draft of the Four-Power Pact, closely related to the British Disarmament Plan, but regarding treaty revisions, it is not as unconditional as proposed by the Italian Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 2nd - French Ambassador to Italy, Ju Vona, made an important statement to a representative of this agency regarding Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's Four-Power Pact proposal, and has now further explained, saying that "Mussolini's proposal further enriches the effectiveness of the Locarno Treaty in practice. According to the Locarno Treaty, Britain and Italy guarantee the borders between France and Germany, as well as between Belgium and Germany, to maintain peace between these countries. If Britain and Italy are suspected of siding with one of the above-mentioned countries, the Locarno Treaty will lose its effect. Mussolini's plan does not intend to make Europe, Asia, and America submit to the will of the four powers. Other countries exist on each continent. The four powers did not ignore them during the negotiations. This is what the public should acknowledge. All current issues can be summarized as follows: Is it better for the four Western powers to compromise, or should they allow each to maintain their opinions? The whole key lies here."</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 2nd - Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu continues to meet with various important French figures. This morning, he met with former Prime Minister Teddy O, a leader of the right wing, and in the afternoon, he met with the newly returned French Ambassador to Italy, Ju Vona.</p>
<h3>Saito Still Struggles</h3>
<p>Preventing Key Cabinet Members of the Seiyukai from Undermining Him</p>
<p>Exerting Full Effort to Lobby Before Today's Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd - Prime Minister Saito met with elder statesman Saionji. Although Saionji understood the future of Japanese politics, the issue of the Saito Cabinet's continuation or resignation was temporarily decided to allow the Prime Minister to continue in office and await an appropriate time to resign. However, after Saito rushed back to Tokyo yesterday afternoon, he had several hours of earnest discussion with Cabinet Secretary Horigiri. As a result, he felt that the Finance Minister Takahashi and Justice Minister Oyama's resolve to resign was exceptionally firm. At the same time, if Takahashi resigns, the Minister of Railways Mitsuchi and the Minister of Education Hatoyama, who are related to him, would also inevitably resign. If this happens, it would not only affect the internal disintegration of the government but also pose a great crisis to the so-called extraordinary domestic and foreign policies. To firmly express his final struggle, before the emergency cabinet meeting scheduled for the 4th, Saito will personally visit the elders of the Seiyu and Minsei parties to seek the understanding of Finance Minister Takahashi and Home Minister Yamamoto, explaining the intentions of elder statesman Saionji, and urging them to stay. However, because the cabinet members of the Seiyukai have consistently adopted a negative attitude, general observation suggests that even if the Saito Cabinet does not immediately collapse, it will find an opportunity to resign en masse in the near future.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd - Prime Minister Saito entered the Imperial Palace this morning to participate in the ancestral memorial service for Emperor Jinmu. After leaving the palace at 11:00 AM, he discussed future government affairs with Cabinet Secretary Horigiri Zenjiro. They held secret talks for an hour before dispersing. In the afternoon, before the emergency cabinet meeting, he prepared to meet with Finance Minister Takahashi, Home Minister Yamamoto, and Justice Minister Oyama to discuss matters. It is reported that after the long and busy 64th Diet session, and after running around to maintain his precarious political life, the Prime Minister's worried face shows increasing signs of aging.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd - Prime Minister Saito's visit to Prince Saionji is of great importance to the future situation and is highly valued by all parties. However, after meeting Prince Saionji, the Prime Minister strongly denied rumors of a political upheaval and stated that he would handle the situation well, even at the cost of his life, so the voice of political stability spread for a time. However, this statement by the Prime Minister was intended to stabilize the political situation temporarily. In fact, his state of mind is the opposite. After the aftermath of the Diet is completed, and the events of May 25th are resolved, and before the next fiscal year's budget is compiled, he will resign. This is the original intention, which remains unchanged. Furthermore, Saionji believes that if Prime Minister Saito resigns at this moment, when no successor has been decided, it would be better to allow the Prime Minister to remain in office temporarily and resign at an appropriate time. This is true. The Prime Minister conveyed this meaning when they met in Okitsu Saionji yesterday. On the one hand, Finance Minister Takahashi, the central force of the cabinet, has a strong intention to resign. Prime Minister Saito is doing his best to persuade him to stay because of his related connections. However, Finance Minister Takahashi's intention is that if the Prime Minister resigns within days, there will be no problem. If he stays, he will resign alone out of respect for the verbal agreement with Seiyukai President Suzuki. It is said that he has already mentioned this matter to the Prime Minister. The government department intends to approve Finance Minister Takahashi's individual resignation and replace him with another person to extend the life of the cabinet. However, if Takahashi resigns, the Minister of Railways Mitsuchi, the Minister of Education Hatoyama, and others who belong to the Seiyukai will naturally be uneasy. In addition, Justice Minister Oyama stated when meeting with the Prime Minister on the 31st that he would take responsibility for the unfortunate incident and wished to step down immediately. Therefore, after the May 15th incident and the issue of the Red Peril of the Judiciary are resolved, the Justice Minister will inevitably resign. As a result, Home Minister Yamamoto, Minister of Education Hatoyama, and others will also be unable to remain calm. Although the Prime Minister intends to visit each cabinet member separately within days, reporting on his meeting with Prince Saionji and urging them to stay, the first obstacle is that Finance Minister Takahashi's retention is impossible. Moreover, the Prime Minister himself is very lacking in confidence in leading the country through extraordinary times, and will still resign at an appropriate time after observing the situation. This is the general observation.</p>
<h3>British Government Discusses Incident of Arrest of British Nationals in China</h3>
<p>Engineer Released on Bail and Rearrested</p>
<p>Britain to Impose Retaliation by Boycotting Russian Goods</p>
<p>Havas, London, 3rd - The special committee studying the Soviet Union's arrest of British engineers from the Vic Electrical Company met at Prime Minister MacDonald's residence at 11:00 AM this morning. British Ambassador to Russia Woffan, Foreign Secretary Simon, Army Minister Hael, Chancellor Chamberlain, and Overseas Territories Minister Thomas were all present.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 2nd - Six British technicians from the British company Vic Electrical Company were previously detained on March 12, accused of sabotage in order to destroy the Russian electrical industry by intentionally causing electrical factories to become idle. Subsequently, all but one were released. However, that person has now been detained again. Two people first released on March 14, Munk House and Nord Hua, were arrested again today, formally charged with espionage for military and economic secrets, engaging in sabotage and bribery. The charges against the other four technicians, three of whom were released on bail, have not yet been released. It is known that all six will be tried by the Soviet Russian court. Today, the British Chargé d'affaires in Russia, Sterling, accompanied Soviet Russian prosecutors to visit the prison and told people that the health of the arrested people was normal. Rumor has it that British Embassy personnel are now packing up to return to Britain, but Reuters learned from responsible sources in London that there is no basis for the suggestion that British diplomats in Russia are about to return home or plan to leave the country. British Ambassador to Russia Woffan is currently in London and will discuss the arrest of British technicians with the government.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - British Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Soviet Union's detention of six British technicians from the Vic Electrical Company that he would submit a motion tomorrow requesting Parliament to authorize the government to deal with the import of Russian goods. This motion must be passed on Wednesday. The British Prime Minister also said that he could not reveal the details of the discussions between the British Ambassador in Moscow and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov regarding the negotiation of a new trade agreement to replace the British-Russian trade agreement expiring on April 17.</p>

<p>Jewish Lawyers Restricted from Entering Court</p>
<p>Nationalist, Berlin, 2nd - The Anti-Jewish Committee has now ordered that all eye-catching slogans and characters in front of shops set up by Jews should be removed because the anti-Jewish movement has been stopped. The various reports of various countries' public opinion on Germany's anti-Jewish movement published in the Berlin newspapers are quite understanding, so it is felt that there is no need to continue to hold the anti-Jewish movement on Wednesday. The legal profession has new rules for the entry of Jewish lawyers into the court. Hereafter, Jewish lawyers entering the court must obtain a special certificate, and this special certificate is not available to those who did not participate in the front lines during the European War.</p>

<h3>German National Party Supports the Current Cabinet</h3>
<p>Nationalist, Berlin, 2nd - The German People's Party today decided through its party leader to unanimously and unconditionally support the Hitler government and issued a declaration stating that the party has always opposed the Weimar coalition government for more than ten years. Fortunately, a consolidated national government has been established. From now on, there is hope for the revival of Germany's future, so it is willing to wholeheartedly support it. It is noted that the German People's Party currently occupies only five seats in the Parliament, but in 1928 it had 45 seats, and in 1920 it had as many as 62 seats. Even in 1930, it still had 30 seats. Since the death of former Foreign Minister Stresemann, the party has been in decline.</p>
<h3>Anti-Jewish Movement Spreads to Austria</h3>
<p>Nationalist, Vienna, 1st - The anti-Jewish movement enforced by Germany on Saturday has obviously spread beyond the borders of Germany, because many places large and small in Austria have also taken the same methods as the Germans to deal with Jews and enforced the same anti-Jewish movement.</p>
<h3>Left and Right Factions Are Irreconcilable</h3>
<p>Bomb Thrown at Nazi Party Meeting Place</p>
<p>Nationalist, Hamburg, 2nd - Today, combatants in the uniforms of the banned "Red Front" attacked a café used as a meeting place by the Nazi Party's Sturmabteilung and threw a bomb into the auditorium of the café, blowing everything into powder. Another bomb did not explode. Fortunately, the members of the Sturmabteilung stationed there had left the museum a few minutes earlier to avoid being killed. According to experts, the bomb was made of a steel pipe 20 centimeters long and had a very large explosive force. At the time, it was thrown in through the window and the perpetrators immediately fled. Eleven communists have now been arrested. The Hamburg Police Chief has issued a document asking the public to assist the authorities in clearing bomb dens and also asking the government authorities to severely punish the criminals.</p>
<h3>Under the Nazi Party's Oppressive Power</h3>
<p>Einstein</p>
<h3>Does Not Want to Revisit German Soil</h3>
<p>Reuters, Belgium, Kosmai, 2nd - Professor Einstein, the famous scientist who invented relativity, arrived here from Beijing today, looking very tired. He is very worried about the safety of his daughter in Germany. The Nazi Party members' inspection of his bank accounts and confiscation of his current assets and securities can be regarded as a general expression of the German people's arrogance. Einstein told a Reuters interviewer here today that in addition to German nationality, he enjoys Swiss citizenship. When he was in Beijing, he had already stated to the German Embassy in Belgium his intention to renounce German nationality. He has no hatred for the German people, but he particularly dislikes the Nazi Party. He believes that Germany is currently suffering from mental illness. He does not want to return to Germany until freedom of speech is restored and the entire German people have guaranteed safety. He believes that the current danger of Jews in Germany lies not only in the trampling of the freedoms granted by the Constitution, but also in the establishment of a situation that makes their economic and social survival very difficult.</p>
<h3>Davis Departs England for France Today</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 3rd - The chief representative of the American Disarmament Team, Davis, visited the French Ambassador to England, Fallot, this morning and arranged the schedule for his trip to Paris to meet with French Prime Minister Daladier. He then visited MacDonald in the afternoon to continue discussions. Mr. Davis plans to leave England for Paris at 11:00 AM tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Siamese King Orders Dissolution of Parliament</h3>
<p>Citing Leftist Tendencies of Parliamentarians</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd - The King of Siam issued a decree today dissolving the Parliament and appointing the Senate to wait for general elections to be held in accordance with the Constitution. This decree was countersigned by members of the cabinet. The reason for this move is that a majority of members of Parliament advocated communism in land placement matters. The Parliament is currently dominated by extremists elected by the so-called People's Party, which succeeded in the revolution on the 6th of last month. At that time, they detained Prince Bali Pattra as a hostage and forced the King of Siam to announce a constitutional monarchy.</p>
<h3>US Banking Sector Opposes Silver Coinage Standard</h3>
<p>Nationalist, Washington, 2nd - It has recently been heard that the National Grand Banks of the United States are strongly urging Treasury Secretary Woody Ding not to approve any silver bills that would cause inflation. Many major bankers have pointed out to Woody Ding that the public bonds issued by the United States all have a guarantee that they must be repaid with gold coins according to the existing fineness in the future. Another faction said that the banks were willing to give the government dictatorial powers during this crisis and help the government issue new bonds, but if the pure gold content in gold coins is reduced in the future or the silver system is restored, it will be extremely difficult for the government to raise funds. Silver is not suitable for use as banknote reserves because its price is unstable. If the currency base is weakened, government bonds will not be easy to sell. It is said that Senator Pittman will meet with Treasury Secretary Woody Ding this week to urge him to approve the silver purchase bill. It is heard that Woody Ding will publish his opinion on the issue of inflating the currency after meeting with Pittman.</p>

<h3>Preparations for Japan's Unilateral Mobilization (Continued)</h3>
<p>2. Industrial Mobilization</p>
<p>The matter of military industrial mobilization pertains solely to the conditions of military operations. However, concerning the outline of future warfare, as mentioned previously, the number of personnel must inevitably increase compared to the Russo-Japanese War, and the demand for military supplies must also be greater. On the other hand, dispelling the people's will to continue fighting has become a significant means of engagement in future wars. Therefore, merely conducting military industrial mobilization cannot be considered a complete preparation for future warfare. It is imperative to consider how to safeguard the lives of the people during such times. If military supplies require a large quantity of materials, how should the needs of the people be addressed? Of course, as in the past, the patriotism of the Japanese people will undoubtedly be second to none. Although there is a willingness to endure hardship, it is ultimately necessary to safeguard the people's lives to the minimum extent possible. Furthermore, from where and how should raw materials be obtained and distributed? How many resources should be provided for the industrial mobilization conducted by the army? The army's hopes are one thing, the navy's hopes are another, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's plans are one thing, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's plans are yet another. Therefore, significant problems arise regarding the allocation of quantities. What kind of organizations should be established to do these things during wartime? This also needs to be planned from peacetime. Furthermore, how should intelligence and propaganda be managed? Relying solely on the army and navy is impossible. And how should finance and economy be? What measures should be taken? There are many things that cannot be accomplished by relying solely on military industrial mobilization. These political and administrative matters, for the sake of preparing for future wars, must be thoroughly planned in peacetime, or else we will fall into the state of panic experienced by various countries during the European War. Therefore, the Resources Bureau will be at the center to plan matters related to total mobilization.</p>
<h3>3. The Content and Organization of the Resources Bureau</h3>
<p>The Resources Bureau is an external bureau of the Cabinet and was established in Showa 2 (1927). The Resources Bureau handles preparatory work related to Japan's national total mobilization. However, the Resources Bureau alone cannot complete such a massive undertaking. Therefore, the Resources Bureau must be at the center, with each ministry cooperating to plan the total mobilization. Additionally, there is the Resources Council, which is a advisory body to the Prime Minister, responsible for advising on total mobilization. The Resources Council is chaired by the Prime Minister, with the Minister of Commerce and Industry and the Minister of the Army as vice-chairmen, and the vice-ministers of each ministry as members. The number of members is 35. The task of this total mobilization cannot be accomplished by the government alone. Its tasks extend to even the most minute details, requiring thorough preparation. Therefore, it is necessary to establish local organizations that are opposed to the central government. Currently, there is no particularly independent local organization, so personnel within the administrative organs of each locality are responsible for handling the preparation work for total mobilization. The content of the Resources Bureau seems to be largely unknown to outsiders. Roughly speaking, first, in order to plan the total mobilization, it is necessary to collect the necessary materials. In short, investigation is the foundation of planning, so it is essential to conduct investigations thoroughly. Therefore, the tasks can be broadly divided into three types: those who are responsible for investigation work, those who handle the substance of the plan, and those who handle matters that should be done in peacetime as a result of the plan. In terms of actual working personnel, the Resources Bureau cannot accommodate so many personnel, so it uses a very small number of personnel to handle the work. Therefore, the army, navy, and other ministries have dispatched the necessary personnel to handle these matters. These personnel are considered to be soldiers of the Resources Bureau. That is, each ministry has dispatched personnel to the Resources Bureau to serve as staff, sharing various tasks.</p>
<h3>4. The First National Total Mobilization</h3>
<p>At the outbreak of the European War, on August 3rd, the president of the famous electrical company in Berlin, Rathenau, offered a plan to the German military authorities. He first met with the director of the German Military Affairs Bureau on August 8th, stating that the strategy must be implemented by the country. On the morning of the 9th, he met with the then Minister of the Army and was adopted. After that, Germany gradually turned the national machinery towards the war effort and eventually became what is now known as national total mobilization. Previously, there was also a total mobilization during the reign of Frederick the Great of Germany, which may be said to be the beginning of total mobilization. Frederick said that the people's first duty is to be loyal to the country, and this has become the German national policy. Therefore, Germany's industrial power and all national power have developed as robustly as the command of the military. Therefore, during the European War, Germany was able to carry out total mobilization relatively smoothly.</p>
<h3>5. The Situation When the United States Entered the War</h3>
<p>It is said that when the United States entered the war, it took considerable preparation to complete all the equipment. Was this because the preparations for peacetime total mobilization were not complete? At the same time, we can also say that France was not complete, and Britain was not complete. When each country joined the World War, it can be said that no country was able to complete the preparation for national total mobilization. There were many reasons why the United States did not join the war effort. The United States is a country of public opinion, so at the time of the outbreak of the war, the public opinion circles were not very active regarding participation in the war. This method of observation is correct. At that time, German submarines carried out unannounced sinking of enemy steamships, carrying out extensive trade destruction warfare. Among the steamships sunk was the Lusitania, carrying a large number of Americans who were also sunk and killed. As a result, public opinion on participation in the war reached its highest level. This is the direct motivation for participating in the war. This is the common view. It is true that two years and eight months passed between the outbreak of the war and joining the war effort. The improvement of the United States' industrial power and the preparation for total mobilization were fairly successful. Participation in the war was in the early part of 1917. What was prepared during this period? That is, the National Defense Act was promulgated in June 1916. The content of this act was that the government could issue orders to purchase all kinds of items with priority, and there were also provisions that forced the people to manufacture military supplies. There were also provisions that the government's purchase price had to be agreed to. The National Defense Act also stated that preparations should be made for the self-sufficiency of 40 million yuan of nitrate soda and that for the purpose of ensuring the preparation of military supplies, an industrial mobilization preparation mechanism could be organized within the authority of the President. That is, the powers of the Parliament were transferred to the government. This was decided in June 1916. That is, there was already preparation for total mobilization before the war. It would be more appropriate to say industrial mobilization rather than total mobilization. Furthermore, at the end of 1916, the National Defense Conference was held, with the ministers of the Army, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, and Labor serving as members, and influential figures from all aspects of the private sector other than political parties serving as advisors. Thus, even before the war, there had already been so-called preparations for total mobilization, and it would not have been a problem to participate in the war at any time. This is an undeniable fact. Furthermore, the amount of military supplies that the United States sold to the European powers was enormous. Therefore, we can say that the actual independent power of the United States in terms of industry was improving, and its foundation was very solid. The amount of money that the European countries paid to the United States amounted to several billion, and the factories were therefore expanded, and the capacity was therefore increasing. This was the United States' path to preparing for total mobilization. However, if we think that the United States participated in the war effort because its preparations were complete, I think that this view is incorrect. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Military Strength and Equipment in Rehe</h3>

<h3>Three Routes of Min Army Enter Jiangxi to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Funds the 19th Route Army's Expedition</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Cai Tingkai, Commander-in-Chief of the Left Route of the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Fujian Border Area Bandit Suppression Army, is employing the first and second columns of the Central Route Army, which have already advanced in different directions towards Guangchang and Ningdu. The Left Route Army should also advance simultaneously to take a pincer movement. The troops currently concentrated in northern and western Fujian are divided into three teams, advancing towards the Jiangxi border. The first team is the [unreadable] Division, [unreadable] Unit, entering Tai Ning from Jiangle, exiting [unreadable]. The second team is the newly organized [unreadable] Division, [unreadable] Unit, entering Ninghua from Qingliu, exiting [unreadable]. The third team is the [unreadable] Division, [unreadable] Unit, entering Changting from Liancheng, exiting [unreadable]. A mobilization order was issued on March 26th, and all three teams simultaneously began a general offensive, aiming to clear the remaining bandits in the Fujian border area within the shortest possible time, and then enter Jiangxi. According to a telegram received yesterday by the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the battles of each team are progressing very smoothly. The entire [unreadable] Division of the first team has entered Tai Ning, defeating the bogus Independent Division on the 27th and killing countless bandits. Division Commander [unreadable] is currently commanding the troops in the northwest mountainous area of Tai Ning, passing Qibaofeng, forcing Deshengguan, and advancing toward [unreadable]. The [unreadable] Division of the second team is also advancing via Qingxi and Helin, engaging in a day and night of fierce fighting with over ten thousand bandit mixed troops entrenched between Ninghua and Qingliu, killing and wounding over a thousand bandits. The bandits were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated towards Anle and Luotang in Ninghua on the 27th. The 4th Brigade Commander, Lu Xingrong, is currently leading a pursuit. The [unreadable] Division of the third team, with Ma Hongyu's Fujian Northern Bandit Suppression Guerrilla Unit as the vanguard, encountered over five thousand members of the bandit's Model Regiment and Young Pioneers at Shanxia and Yantou on the Ting border on the 26th. After half a day of fierce fighting, over twenty of the bandit side's company, platoon and battalion commanders were killed, along with hundreds of bandit troops. Over two hundred rifles were seized, and over one hundred bogus officers and soldiers were captured. The bandit forces were unable to withstand the attacks and fled in all directions. Division [unreadable] is now taking advantage of the victory to attack the northwestern part of Changting. Cai Tingkai will soon go to Guangdong to assume the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army and lead his troops north. Regarding the funding for the 19th Route Army's expedition, in addition to the Pacification Commissioner's Office assuming a portion, the provincial government has also decided to subsidize 20,000 yuan per month.

<h3>Hunan Province Establishes Bureau to Prepare for Mining</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province is rich in mineral deposits, and if they can be mined in an orderly manner, it will be of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Currently, Yu Jichuan, the head of the Construction Bureau, is actively preparing for this mining matter. For example, the Shuikoushan lead-zinc mine, where the ore deposits are depleted and nearing the end of their lifespan, in addition to already establishing an office to explore the Yin Keng (Silver Pit) of Hengshan, it is planned to add exploration engineering offices in Linxiang and Taoyuan.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding gold mines in the province, in addition to Pingjiang, where a bureau has already been established for trial operations, the Yuanjiang area, such as Mobin in Huitong, Tanxi at the junction of Qianyang and Huitong, Liulin in Yuanling, Congshumian Daxixi, Canyexi and Yinjiaxi in Taoyuan, as well as the river sand gold in the Hanshou area, contain relatively rich gold content. At a time when gold prices are high, it is planned to have the government mine them to increase financial resources. As for the coal areas, in addition to Xiangxiang Xingshandian, where an office has already been established for drilling exploration, the Laihe firewood coal site between Yongxing and Laiyang, near the Guangdong-Hankou Railway line, it is planned to have the government demarcate a larger firewood coal area and establish an office to conduct trial explorations first. After the railway is completed, preparations will be made for mining, with Guangdong as the market, and the profits will be very high. Also, the cinnabar ore of Sajiatang in Huang County, the crystal and silver mines near Shangwubao in Jianghua, and rare metal alloys are all special products, and it is also planned to establish an office to conduct trial explorations in preparation for mining.

<h3>Dispute over Park Construction in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Barracks Management Office Arrests Workers and Sends Them to Nanjing</p>
<p>People of Bengbu Oppose Aviation Station Building Oil and Bomb Bunkers</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: South of Bengshan, which is close to the city of Bengbu, there are 54 Qing (unit of area) of civilian land. In the 7th year of the Republic of China, it was forcibly purchased by the late Anhui Military Governor Ni Sichong to build the Yangtze River Inspector-General's Office and barracks. However, Ni left and it was not realized. Later, after repeated struggles by the landowners, it was never recovered. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, Commander-in-Chief Chiang ordered the construction of barracks south of the mountain for the purpose of stationing troops. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Fang Zhenwu was stationed here and used military engineers to build a Martyrs' Park around Bengshan, which was filed with the Central Government. The park was not completed, and Fang left Anhui, so construction was halted. In the 20th year, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent personnel to jointly demarcate the boundary with the Public Security Bureau, but without the consent of the local people, they simply designated Bengshan into the barracks area, presuming Bengshan as reverse property. In the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Xu Tingyao was stationed in Bengbu and served as the Garrison Commander. Xu believed that the surroundings of Bengshan already had the prototype of a park and should be continued to completion. He especially built the Fourth Division Martyrs' Cemetery and Memorial Hall at the foot of the south side of the mountain, and indicated to local people that they could build Bengbu Park here as a place for public recreation. All sectors organized the Bengbu Park Construction Committee, first surveying the east, west and south sides of Bengshan several times, deciding to build a stone wall. Where there were civilian houses occupied within the boundary at the foot of the mountain's east side, the Public Security Bureau issued a notice to demolish them within a time limit. Unexpectedly, that place was under the jurisdiction of the Bengbu Barracks Management Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs, so the resident of that place, Tang Shaoxian, refused to move and did not demolish the house. He especially filed a complaint with the Barracks Management Office. The Barracks Management Office, based on Tang Shaoxian's report, immediately forwarded it to the Ministry of Military Affairs for verification. The Ministry of Military Affairs believed it was an encroachment on the camp and consulted with the Provincial Government to order the Fengyang County Government and the Bengbu Public Security Bureau to strictly stop it. The Barracks Management Office sent troops on March 28th to arrest three workers who were building the wall and detained them in the office, causing the project to be suspended. The Park Construction Committee was very indignant upon hearing the news and believed that the Barracks Management Office illegally arrested people. They appointed representatives to visit Wang Kaizhen, the Commander of the Seventh Division stationed in Bengbu and concurrently the Director of the Bengbu Military and Police Inspectorate, and asked him to negotiate with the office for their release. Wang immediately consulted with Wang Jijing, the director of the Barracks Management Office, requesting the transfer of the arrested workers to the Military and Police Inspectorate. Wang agreed readily. Unexpectedly, Wang sent people to Nanjing on the 31st to hand over the workers to the Ministry of Military Affairs for disposal. Local people were also very dissatisfied with Wang's illegal and untrustworthy behavior. They especially held a joint meeting at the Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 1st to discuss ways to rescue the three workers. It was decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Military Affairs requesting their release, and it was also planned to send representatives north to visit Xu Tingyao, the commander of the Seventeenth Army, and ask him to ask Minister He to preside over everything, release the arrested workers, and allow the continuation of construction in order to complete the park.</p>
<p>The Bengbu Aviation Station, previously the barracks for storing gasoline and bombs in Bengbu had long been in disrepair and unsuitable for use. It designated the Bengshan location, drew up drawings and estimated the work, and submitted it to the Aviation Administration for forwarding to the Ministry of Military Affairs, to dig bunkers for storing oil and bombs in the area. It was approved for construction. The station specially sent a letter to the Bengbu Park Construction Committee requesting that the inner wall of the outer wall east of the Bengshan Martyrs' Tomb be handed over for construction. After receiving the letter, the committee believed that storing oil and bombs in Bengshan, in the center of Bengbu City, was extremely dangerous. If an explosion occurred, the lives of the city's 100,000 people would be unimaginable. Therefore, they sent a letter requesting that construction be stopped to avoid danger. However, the Aviation Station believed that it had been reported and approved by the Ministry of Military Affairs and decided to dig oil and bomb bunkers at the foot of Bengshan East, and had already surveyed and demarcated the lines, preparing to start construction. Upon hearing this news, local groups here, under worry and fear, strongly opposed it. This afternoon (the 1st), representatives from all sectors held an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. Representatives were appointed to visit Commander Wang and ask him to stop it, and telegrams were sent to the National Government, the Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting that they quickly order the cessation of the construction of oil and bomb bunkers to avoid danger and ensure safety.

<h3>Disputes between Zhongfu Coal Mines and the Daoging Railway</h3>
<p>Responsible Remarks by the Director of the Daoging Railway Bureau</p>
<p>Jizuo Correspondence: On March 23rd, a train of the Daoging Railway transporting coal for the Fu Company arrived at the Jizuo Station, when suddenly many primary school students sent by the Zhongyuan Coal Mine Company arrived at the station to block it, not allowing it to proceed. The truth of this matter is largely unknown to outsiders. The following is a transcript of the remarks made by Fan Yusui, the Director of the Daoging Railway Bureau:</p>
<p>(Cooperation between Zhongfu and Suspension of Work at the Fu Mine) Before the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Zhongyuan Coal Mine Company and the British-owned Fu Company in Jizuo originally adopted a method of joint production and sales, and their business developed together. At that time, the Daoging Railway was also able to repay the principal and interest of the Fu Company's foreign debt on schedule. Since the Shanghai May 30th Massacre occurred, the Fu Company suspended work due to opposition from local people. Its coal sales market was exclusively occupied by Zhongyuan. Zhongyuan could have taken this opportunity to develop as much as possible, but due to poor management, its business declined day by day. Since the current Manager Li Wenhao took over, he has made considerable rectification. Last November, the company held a shareholders' meeting, and the dividends distributed amounted to as much as 23.3%, but in reality, the dividends set were not distributed.</p>
<p>(Movement to Restart Work at the Fu Mine Thwarted) The Zhongyuan Company was unable to absorb the Fu Company's old workers due to its poor business operations, and was also unable to purchase coal mined by private kilns, so some unemployed workers and those who lived by [selling coal or collecting rent from coal kiln land had no choice but to request the Fu Company to restart work. At the same time, Sino-British relations gradually returned to normal, and the Fu Company actively campaigned to resume work. After being allowed by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to convene a meeting in Kaifeng. At that time, only six principles were discussed, and there were no concrete results before it was dismissed. At this time, the parties concerned in Zhongyuan Company and some local people were opposed to the Fu Company starting work. Last May, I (Fan said himself) came to the head of the Daoging Railway and met with the vice chairman of Zhongyuan, who still insisted on opposing the Fu Company's attitude, and said that those who supported the Fu Company's starting work were all running dogs of imperialism, and Zhongyuan would never coexist with them.</p>
<p>(Zhongfu Meeting and Coal Mining at the Fu Mine) By the second half of last year, the situation gradually changed. The key people in charge of Zhongyuan no longer opposed the Fu Company starting work, and were willing to cooperate with the Fu Company under appropriate conditions. Last October, the Ministry of Industry sent personnel again to convene a meeting of representatives from both Zhongfu sides. Zhongyuan proposed fourteen cooperation terms, which the Fu Company accepted. After being slightly revised by the Henan Provincial Government, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan, and was approved by the Executive Yuan. Thus, the situation of Zhongfu cooperation was finalized. This is the general situation of the process. Due to diplomatic relations and Zhongyuan's inability to develop independently, the Fu Company finally resumed work, which is unfortunate for China's mining industry, but the situation was inevitable.</p>
<p>With the permission of the Henan Provincial Government, the Fu Company started pumping water in May last year. Initially, some local people opposed it. With the protection of the local government, after pumping water, they immediately followed it with coal mining. In July and August last year, it was said that it produced four to five hundred tons per day. At the end of last year, it was producing more than a thousand tons per day. The Mining Tax Office under the Ministry of Finance also saw a surge in revenue as a result. This is the process of the Fu Company's coal mining.</p>
<p>(Coal Transportation Process and Current Situation of the Fu Mine) Since the Fu Company suspended work, coal transportation has never stopped in the past few years, because the company's old coal reserves were used to maintain the lives of some of its employees and to supply electricity and tap water to Jiaozuo City. Therefore, it transported nearly 200 tons a day at various small stations on this road. In December last year, when representatives of the Zhongfu companies were meeting, Zhongyuan suddenly sent a letter requesting the Railway Bureau to completely stop transportation for the Fu Company, on the grounds that cooperation conditions were being discussed, in order to show difficulty for the Fu Company. In the past, when all parties opposed the Fu Company, the mine's coal transportation was not prohibited. After the Zhongfu cooperation principle was finalized, it wanted to stop transportation instead. The reason was incomprehensible. Moreover, the company's large-scale mining had become a public fact, and the Ministry of Finance had already levied its mining tax. Before receiving orders from superiors, how could this road suddenly stop the trains? However, in order to maintain Zhongyuan's business, even after the Fu Company protested repeatedly, it still only allowed 300 tons per day according to the usual practice, and did not allocate any more cars. Because the Fu Company's negotiations with this road were ineffective, it repeatedly urged the Ministry of Railways, and used demanding repayment of the debt owed by this road as a countermeasure. And as the Fu Company's attitude toward this route hardened after the Zhongfu cooperation conditions were passed by the Executive Yuan, they said: Since your government has allowed coal mining and collected mining taxes, why does your road alone not allow coal transportation, and does your road have an obligation to repay debts, etc. This road was severely questioned by the Fu Company on the one hand, and received orders from the Ministry of Railways to raise funds to repay interest on the other. Also, because the cooperation conditions between the two companies had been finalized, and the provinces needed coal very urgently, Zhongyuan's coal production was decreasing day by day, which was not enough to meet their needs, so on March 23, it was allowed to allocate a train, but it was still not allowed to be transported to other roads and Daokou Xinxiang, still trying to maintain Zhongyuan's sales in handling foreign affairs.</p>
<p>(Fu Company's Coal Transportation Vehicles Blocked) Unexpectedly, when this train arrived at Jiaozuo, dozens of primary school students from Fuzhong led by teachers arrived at the station to block it, preventing it from proceeding. At the same time, there were many Zhongyuan miners and more than 300 mine police officers at Lihe Station holding guns in a show of force. There were also dozens of primary school students holding sticks lined up on the platform shouting slogans. As a result, the Fu Company's coal transportation was completely stopped.</p>
<p>(The Daoging Railway's Attitude on This) The attitude that this road has always held, such as maintaining Zhongyuan's sales market and limiting the Fu Company's vehicles, is nothing more than supporting the interests of our country and restricting the activities of foreign businessmen, which is not at all different from the attitude held by Zhongyuan and local people. The reason why we reluctantly coped with the Fu Company was that the government had allowed it to start work and had already collected mining taxes. Before receiving orders from the ministry, the railway bureau did not dare to take the responsibility of stopping transportation without authorization. Now that Zhongyuan has forcibly blocked the train in the name of the people, then all the responsibilities arising from this will naturally be borne by Zhongyuan. If Zhongyuan can find a proper solution so that this road will not be blamed by the government for stopping transportation without authorization, and will not be urged and questioned by creditors again, then it is the heart's greatest satisfaction and there is nothing we would not be happy to follow. Therefore, from now on, unless the Zhongfu companies have agreed on a method, this road will never again allocate cars to the Fu Company to transport coal.</p>
<p>(Zhongyuan Owes the Daoging Railway Transportation Fees) From the above observations, the dispute between Zhongyuan and the Fu Company is not the responsibility of this road.</p>
<p>If Zhongyuan wants to limit the Fu Company's vehicles, then this road has long limited them. Zhongyuan made students block the Fu Company's coal cars, then this road has completely stopped transporting Fu coal. However, Zhongyuan still does not understand the difficulties that this road is trying to solve. It even announced that this road has idle vehicles and does not transport coal for the company, resulting in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of tons of coal. It did not mention the various facts of this road maintaining the company, and the huge amount of transportation fees owed to this road, which is inconsistent with the facts. Now, the recent telegrams between this road and the company are disclosed to clarify the truth:</p>
<p>(Zhongyuan's Telegram to the Daoging Railway) Fan Yusui, Director of the Jiaozuo Daoging Railway Bureau, My Brother, The telegram has been received. This company has repeatedly negotiated with your bureau to allocate cars to transport to other roads, but has not been approved. You used the excuse of fearing being detained for military transportation, causing this company's coal to accumulate to hundreds of thousands of tons, causing great losses to its business. And your road has many idle vehicles. Considering the friendship of mutual assistance between the road and the mine and the railway's regulation of production and sales, there is no regret. The railway administration is unified, and each road belongs to the state. Cars from outside roads transport to your road, and your road's cars transport to outside roads, which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The vehicles under your road's jurisdiction were occupied and dispersed by warlords in the past. After this company spent a lot of effort in negotiation, they were finally recovered. Among them, there were those that were redeemed by this company's reserves. You may not have been aware of the historical events of this period. Before this company cooperated with the Fu Company, it stated that it would not operate independently. However, your bureau specially facilitated the smooth transportation, which is deeply regrettable for the interests of the nation. This company's mission is to rescue people's livelihood and popularize public welfare, which is not comparable to capitalist private enterprises. Therefore, the local public welfare expenses borne each year amount to 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Do those mines operated by foreign merchants have even a fraction of the surplus to the Chinese people? Moreover, the transportation fees paid by this company to your bureau each year account for a huge amount of your road's income, which is increasing compared to the past. Considering both public justice and private feelings, you should also give special convenience. However, you ignore historical facts and are demanding in every way, which is far beyond my expectations. In short, your road and this company are closely related. I hope you will carefully and carefully consider the legitimate path of benefiting the country and the people, cooperate to the end, and complete each inherent mission. I ask you to be familiar with and consider it. The loading time for vehicles from other roads to come to this company has always been controlled by your bureau, and there has been no delay. The points indicated in your telegram may be misunderstandings. I also declare this. Yours sincerely, Li Wenhao, Chairman of Zhongyuan Company.</p>
<p>(Daoging's Reply to Zhongyuan's Telegram) Li Yuanji, Chairman of the Jiaozuo Zhongyuan Company, my Brother, the telegram you sent has been received. The telegram falsely accused that this road refused to allocate vehicles to transport to other roads, resulting in the company's coal being backlogged by hundreds of thousands of tons and the business suffering losses. In this month's telegram to this bureau, you stated that due to the dumping of enemy coal and the impact of the current situation, the company's business is getting worse and the income is getting lower, and the arrears are due to these reasons. Comparing the two, even if your company has hundreds of thousands of tons of accumulated coal, it is not the fault of this road's vehicles not going out to other roads. Moreover, this road originally agreed with and supported the exchange of vehicles and convenient coal transportation, and has been doing it for more than a day. However, your company owes more than 140,000 yuan for transportation and miscellaneous fees to be paid to this road, claiming that it was from the warlord management era and refusing to acknowledge the payment. The new debts have reached 200,000 yuan, and despite repeated reminders, there is no concrete solution. And in accordance with the four-way joint transportation method for coal transportation to other roads, the transportation fees that should be shared by the road where the vehicles are located and the road through which they travel must be settled by the roads on a monthly basis and paid in cash. Your company owes a large amount, and it is inconvenient to transport sales to this road. Those who are not able to receive current fees and those who are jointly transported to other roads must be paid in advance by this road in cash. If all vehicles are allocated to transport to other roads, then the few cash incomes of this road's daily passenger and freight, or even not enough to pay in advance the transportation fees to other roads for your company's coal transportation to other roads, the livelihood problems of all the employees of the road will be impossible to solve. You should also not be able to draw water from a well to save people. You indicated that the vehicles on our road were occupied by warlords in the past, and we are very grateful for your assistance in the negotiation. However, you said that some of them were redeemed with loans from the company, which we had not heard of before. After checking, the railway vehicles are all state-owned, and there are no cases of sales or loans. How can there be such a thing as redeeming them with money? We are surprised to hear this. Regarding the Fu Company's coal transportation, this road has always respected your company's opinions and strictly limited it. The average daily sales volume is less than 200 tons, and it is not allowed to be transported to other roads and Daokou Xinxiang. After the Provincial Government allowed pumping water and provided protection, it continued to mine. On the one hand, it paid mining taxes, and on the other hand, it protested to the Ministry and this road in the capacity of a creditor, and only then was it allowed to allocate a train to transport and sell to the small stations outside of Xinxiang and Daokou on this road. It was originally to take care of the government's foreign credit and still maintain the intention of protecting your company's business, but we are still not understood and accused us of being demanding, which is deeply regrettable. Since I took over this road, I have regarded your company as one of the more promising in our country's mining industry, and have done everything possible to help. For example, the special price of 600-ton coal transportation was originally a kind of monopolistic freight rate to restrict private kilns during the era when the Fu Company sold coal and this road had ample vehicles. After the military rise, the vehicles were scattered and had long been discontinued. In the summer of last year, your company requested to use it jointly due to the slow sales of coal, and Zhuan Te allowed it to be implemented for three months. In January of this year, due to the closure of the historical year, the sales were stagnant, and we continued to ask for a special price, and we also allowed it to be applied for seventeen days. The total reduction in transportation fees for the two times was about 60,000 yuan. Moreover, coal has always been the main item of freight transportation on this road in recent years. Due to your company's reduced production and poor sales, this road's vehicles have not been able to be used as much as possible, and you have repeatedly sent letters requesting to restrict the transportation of private kilns and the Fu Company, which has resulted in them being idle. According to statistics, from May last year to February of this year, in order to maintain your company's sales, the number of vehicles that were idle, calculated on a daily basis, reached 150,000 tons. At least according to the income of one yuan per ton per day, the loss is about 150,000 yuan. Combining the previously mentioned reduction in special price, it totals 210,000 yuan. In addition, the arrears of transportation fees are hundreds of thousands, and they have been repeatedly delayed. We have never stopped transportation because of the arrears. This road is small and has a tight budget. There are many difficulties at home and abroad. The sacrifice has reached its highest limit. However, what you want is that this road will supply all of its vehicles to your company for transportation on credit. Even if there is free time, it will not allocate a single vehicle to private kilns or the Fu Company, and the arrears of transportation fees will be paid by your company at your convenience without any reminders. Only then will the mission of cooperation be completed. Such methods, from the perspective of personal friendship, can be accommodated, but what about the maintenance fees and the livelihood of the employees on the road? You are smart, and I hope you can teach us. As for the section where vehicles from other roads arrive at the mine due to the lack of coal loading or the failure to determine the sales location, the Lihe and Xinxiang stations on this road have records, and there are employees traveling with the vehicles from other roads who can inquire. The responsibility lies with whom is not difficult to prove and will not be described. Zhuan Dian Feng replied, I hope you can understand, Fan Yusui bowed.</p>

<h3>City Crime: Another Robbery in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>Last night's attempted robbery involving the Li family in the city had not even subsided, and residents were already in a panic, when unexpectedly, at noon today (the 3rd), another robbery occurred within the city walls, a truly shocking event. The incident took place at the residence of Ye Zhishong, located near the Black Bridge abutment inside the West Gate. While the family was having lunch, six uninvited guests suddenly appeared. Two were dressed in uniforms, one in a Zhongshan suit, and three in plainclothes. They initially claimed to be interested in renting a room and asked to see the landlord. However, the family sensed that the men looked fierce and realized they were bandits. Just as they were about to raise the alarm, the gang stationed two members as lookouts. The remaining four bandits stormed inside, confining the men, women, and servants to one room. They slapped the homeowner, Ye Zhishong, demanding he reveal the location of his hidden silver, and brandished hemp rope in a threatening manner. Ye's wife, terrified by the sight, retreated into a room. The gang followed her in, forcing her to open an iron box. They took six hundred yuan in banknotes, stuffing it into their pockets, but still unsatisfied, they seized twelve silver dollars from Ye's wife, and removed her gold ring and gold watch, both inlaid with red diamonds. Before leaving, they also stole a wool-blend lined jacket. Finally, they whooped and hollered as they exited the house, fleeing eastward into a small alley beside the Qian family's residence, heading north. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched several teams of police officers and detectives to search inside and outside the city. Meanwhile, Inspector Yang Shijie led detectives Shen Guichang and others in pursuit towards the eastern suburbs. At Chedun, near Zhang Bridge, they spotted two suspicious individuals on a long-distance bus. One was wearing a Zhongshan suit with incense burns on his head, clearly a disguised monk, and the other was in plainclothes. Upon searching them, they found counterfeit identification and three hundred and forty yuan of the stolen money. They were taken back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. They confessed that their names were Zhang Fuxing and Yang Zhengming, both from Anhui province. They conspired with other escaped bandits (names temporarily withheld) to carry out the robbery, and after obtaining the loot, they divided it at the North Gate, and so on. Currently, Director Shen has presented the captured bandits to the Administrative Inspector's Office for interrogation. He has also ordered Inspector Yang Shijie to strictly pursue the escaped bandits, ensuring they are apprehended and brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Replacement of Education Committee Causes Student Unrest</h3>
<p>The Education Association of the Seventeenth District of the county, due to the resignation of the sixth district education committee member, which was approved by the County Education Bureau, appointed Xi Hanliang as the acting replacement. Upon hearing this news, the Education Association of the district immediately sent representatives to the bureau to request that they retain Zhang Quan. More than fifty primary school teachers from the district also walked to the city to petition. The Education Bureau Chief Zang Hu was nearly surrounded. As no resolution was reached, the representatives tendered their resignations and went to the county government to petition, creating a very serious situation. County Magistrate Chen gave a warm speech to comfort and persuade them, while reporting the situation to the provincial government. Yesterday, he also instructed the Public Security Bureau to order its subordinates to strictly protect Bureau Chief Zang, to prevent any accidents. Yesterday, all the principals and teachers of the district held an emergency meeting to discuss future actions, resolving that if their goals were not achieved, they would all resign en masse, displaying an extremely determined attitude. Currently, Zhang She Elementary School is covered with anti-protest slogans and flyers. It is unknown how this storm will be resolved.</p>
<h3>County Court Investigates the "Eight Gangs"</h3>
<p>In Xiyi there are those so-called "Eight Gangs," which are groups of unemployed vagrants who specialize in reporting opium and gambling cases as a means of extortion. Therefore, those in the city with some wealth who have these habits cannot escape their attention. Recently, there is a new "Eight Gangs" with even harsher methods. The day before yesterday afternoon, Miao Wenqing and Zhu Zhaoji, members of the new "Eight Gangs," broke into the home of Xue Huidong, a resident of Sanxia Tang, intending to extort money. Xue, who is Yuan Xiangcheng's son-in-law, saw the two men burst into his inner chambers and knew they were not good people. He ordered his servants to restrain Miao and Zhu and hand them over to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Also, Shu Jinzhai, a resident of Dawang Temple Alley in the city, who runs the Tianfeng Rice Shop and has modest wealth, was recently extorted two hundred silver dollars by the gang under the guise of investigating smoking. This matter was discovered by the County Court, which has detained gang members for investigation and punishment.</p>

<h3>Cries of Despair by the Sea, Abandoning a Car</h3>
<p>On the highway connecting Zha and Haiyan, the evening before last, a public car from Shanghai stopped there. Only one person was in the car, wearing a black woolen jacket, about thirty years old. After getting out of the car, he sat by the roadside, crying loudly towards the sea. When asked by bystanders, he did not answer. The next morning, the car was still in the same place, but the person had disappeared, apparently having abandoned it and left. The Public Security Bureau, because the car was obstructing the road, took it back to the bureau to wait for someone to claim it. The registration information on the car indicates it belongs to Shanghai Municipal Council number 429.</p>

<h3>Li Shizeng Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday with Belgian Ambassador</h3>
<p>Li Returns Home to Seek International Cultural Cooperation</p>
<p>Intending to Visit Capital Tonight Due to Travel Fatigue</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Li Shizeng, representing our country at the World Cultural Cooperation Conference, traveled to Geneva last year. After six months of attendance, they initiated a return trip to promote the establishment of the Chinese International Library and to hold a Chinese National Book Exhibition, both tasks for which they sought to connect with the central government and actively proceed. Yesterday afternoon at five o'clock, they arrived in port aboard the Italian postal ship Contessa, landing at the New Customs Wharf. Chairman Chiang's representative, Mayor Wu, Premier Wang's representative, Chu Minyi, and more than fifty others went to the wharf to welcome them. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Welcoming Party</h3>
<p>Those who arrived at the port yesterday to welcome Mr. Li included Chairman Chiang's representative, Mayor Wu of the Military Affairs Commission, Chu Minyi representing Premier Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan, former Minister of Education Li Shuhua representing Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, Legislative Councilor Tao Xuan, as well as Wu Yunzhai, Li Xuefan, Li Zongkan, Ying Shi, Liang Renjie, Dai Xiujun, Cui Zhuxi, Cheng Shewo, Xiao Jinfang, Tang Zaili, Chen Mengzhao, Xiao Wenzhao, Li Xixian, Zhang Shijie, Mrs. Zhang Renjie, Mrs. Zheng Wenzhao, and Kong Xiangxi's son, among more than fifty others.</p>
<h3>Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>When welcoming the Lis yesterday, two small launches, Yunfei and others, and two launches from the Jianghai Customs were prepared by the Li residence in advance. The welcoming party took the Yunfei and others from the New Customs Wharf at half past three in the afternoon to wait at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. However, the ship carrying the Lis did not dock until five o'clock. As it was still early, they agreed to sit and drink tea in the main street of Qichang Wharf. The small room filled with many people attracted much attention. When the Contessa entered the Wusongkou port, they gathered at the dock to wait. At this time, Chu Minyi, Mayor Wu, and others also arrived successively on the Jinghui launch. At five o'clock and five minutes, the ship finally docked. The welcoming party, led by Mayor Wu, boarded the ship to greet each other. Mr. Li shook hands with everyone in greeting, and then transferred to the Jinghui launch, which sailed back to the New Customs Wharf for disembarkation, before proceeding directly to the Sino-Western Sanatorium for rest.</p>
<h3>Accompanying Personnel</h3>
<p>Accompanying the Lis on their return trip were Belgian Ambassador Jiumu, Li's secretary Pan Jiping, Chen Qibao of the European Education Group, and others. Also, the famous actress Cheng Qiuyan, who had traveled to Europe for sightseeing, returned on the same ship. According to her, the results of this trip were very satisfactory, but she did not perform in Europe. After briefly visiting old friends in Shanghai, she will return to Beijing for rest.</p>
<h3>Li's Remarks</h3>
<p>Mr. Li made a statement when taking the ferry to Shanghai, saying, "I went to Geneva this time, and then to France, Germany, England, and Italy for six months. I attended many world cultural cooperation conferences, both broad and narrow. These conferences are held dozens of times each year. In the past, the organization was scattered, but since the establishment of the League of Nations, it has been unified. Each country has a branch. The first conference was attended by Mr. Wu Zhihui representing our country, the second by Lin Yutang, and this is the third. The general headquarters is located in Geneva, and I spend most of my time there. Therefore, we have established a permanent Chinese organization there. World cultural cooperation has countless aspects and requires continuous effort. We recently made a most important effort, establishing the Chinese International Library in Geneva, which is scheduled to open in July of this year during the general meeting of the World Cultural Cooperation Conference. At the same time, we will hold a Chinese International Cooperation Book Exhibition Research Conference. These two efforts directly seek international cultural cooperation and indirectly represent the cooperation between China and the international community. The purpose of this return trip is to promote these three matters, but I must rush to Geneva before the opening."</p>
<h3>Japan Isolated</h3>
<p>At this point, the reporter asked, "The Sino-Japanese dispute is becoming increasingly serious. Can you tell us about the attitudes of various countries towards our situation?" Mr. Li said, "I am very optimistic. Although each country itself is currently facing many difficulties and cannot attend to the Far East, in general, we can be optimistic. All countries in the world must be able to cooperate with our country." Mr. Li Shizeng (photographed by Li Zunyong) "Japan's arrogant withdrawal from the League of Nations has isolated it. Countries are no longer as ambiguous as before. In my personal observation, in addition to the spiritual and moral sanctions that the League of Nations has already imposed on Japan, the second step of the League of Nations will inevitably be to implement economic sanctions against Japan, and even military sanctions. This is a good opportunity for us. We should quickly improve our organization and decide on concrete measures against Japan. World trends are mostly in cooperation with our country to uphold justice. Therefore, in addition to our own efforts, cooperation with various countries is the only bright path. Even Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated international cooperation, which is detailed in his National Reconstruction Program. Whether in theory or in fact, China has a need to cooperate with the international community." He went on to say that when he was in Geneva, he met with our representatives Yan Gu and Guo, former Minister of Communications Chen Zhenru, Zhang Fakui, and others, and they were all very concerned about national affairs.</p>
<h3>Visiting Capital Tonight</h3>
<p>Because of the long journey, Mr. Li rested for a night at the Sino-Western Sanatorium last night. He plans to take the train to the capital tonight with Zhang Jingjiang, Hu Zhihui, and others to report to the central government on his experiences at the World Cultural Cooperation Conference. Yesterday, Mr. Chu Minyi had already reserved a special car for them to ride in.</p>
<p>Zhu Hexiang</p>
<h3>Returns from Overseas Inspection in Nanyang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Extremely Enthusiastic About Patriotic Activities</p>
<p>Distressed by Business Downturn</p>
<p>Zhu Hexiang, Director of the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was ordered by the ministry in November of last year to inspect the conditions of our country's consulates and overseas Chinese in Nanyang. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the Pulto President with his secretary Zhou Yitong. They arrived at the port at about 4 p.m. yesterday. Zhao Tiezhang, acting director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office, Secretary Li Rongyao, Zhang Qiyu, a staff member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Qiu Yeyu, a member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Zhu and his secretary took a small launch specially prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Jianghai Customs Wharf and returned to his residence to rest. On the ship, Mr. Zhu made the following statement to reporters from various newspapers: "After leaving Shanghai in November of last year, I traveled to Vietnam, Singapore, Penang, Thailand, Yangon, Kolkata, Medan, Palembang, Batavia, Surabaya, Makassar, and other places. I have been inspecting the condition of the consulates and overseas Chinese, which lasted for more than five months. I have recently completed my mission. After passing through the Philippines, I returned to Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai today. I intend to rest for a while and return to Beijing in about two or three days to report my mission." He said that the overseas Chinese have a very deep concept of the motherland, and they are enthusiastically carrying out all kinds of national salvation work, which is very gratifying. However, due to the impact of the world economic depression, business is very depressed, and there are many unemployed workers. The leading figures in the overseas Chinese community all hope that the government will find ways to provide relief so that they can maintain themselves and overcome the current difficulties. Among the overseas Chinese businesses in this depressed situation, the Philippines and Thailand are relatively sustainable. In Singapore, the local rubber and tin mining industries have plummeted, which has had a huge impact on Chinese business and industry. The overseas Chinese business in Vietnam is also very depressed, and 50-60% of the shops have closed down. The Dutch territories are slightly better than the British territories. Most of the overseas Chinese schools in overseas territories do not have a fixed regular source of funding, and rely on donations from various businesses to maintain themselves. At present, business is depressed, and the source of donations is also gradually decreasing, resulting in exhausted funds and difficulties in maintaining the schools. The local governments of the British and Dutch territories are strict in their control of teaching materials. Teachers who teach the Three Principles of the People are often expelled back to their countries. In recent years, all schools have used Mandarin Chinese for teaching, so the promotion of Mandarin Chinese will have significant progress in the future. The political orders in the Philippines are relatively lenient, but the funding is also extremely difficult. The Consulate General is currently convening a joint meeting of various schools to discuss ways to consult and merge in order to save money. The finances of overseas Chinese schools in Thailand are still relatively affluent, but the Thai government has issued new regulations requiring each school to teach twenty-four hours of Thai language courses per week, the purpose of which is to gradually replace the Chinese language with Thai, so that Chinese students will naturally assimilate. This is the most noteworthy thing. Our government should deeply study and remedy this. The situation of the consulates varies from place to place, with varying degrees of complexity, and it is not possible to describe them in detail in a short period of time. In general, among the work of the consulates, there are many who are able to abide by the rules and regulations and do their best for the overseas Chinese, but there are also those who are perfunctory and disregard their duties. Before I report to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is difficult for me to say anything about it. In addition, the overseas Chinese in various places are also no less patriotic than their compatriots at home when it comes to the issue of resisting Japan. Since receiving the news that the central government has decided on long-term resistance, they have felt extremely excited. They all believe that the strong neighbors have invaded, leading to an intolerable situation. They have no choice but to take this action of resistance for the survival of the country. Moreover, this resistance is not only a matter of China's own survival, but also a war to uphold international treaties and trust, which they regard as an supreme honor. They firmly believe that justice will prevail one day, and that the final victory will belong to us. At present, the whole country, from top to bottom, is united in sincerity and solidarity to resist foreign aggression. Overseas Chinese have also expressed their patriotic enthusiasm, unwilling to fall behind their compatriots at home, and are determined to maintain a calm and persevering attitude, ready to sacrifice everything to back the government, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of victory. I was extremely pleased to see this situation. I think that my compatriots at home will be even more encouraged when they hear of it, so as to comfort the aspirations of the overseas Chinese."</p>
<p>When asked by the reporter from the Central News Agency about the declining business of the overseas Chinese and what methods would be taken to remedy it, Mr. Zhu replied that the remedial methods, in his opinion, were: "(1) Establishing an overseas Chinese bank to facilitate the business of overseas Chinese merchants, (2) opening up Nanyang Chinese shipping to restore rights and interests, and (3) paying attention to overseas Chinese education to increase the knowledge of overseas Chinese. As for the consular visa forms in Nanyang, they have all been processed in accordance with the regulations, and the results are quite good." It is also known that Mr. Zhu has scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Luo in Beijing on the evening of the 7th or the morning of the 8th of this month to report everything.</p>

Therefore, the originally scheduled itinerary will be slightly changed. A definite decision still requires the group to notify the municipal government by telegram after leaving Shanghai this morning, and then the municipal government will determine the reception schedule.</p>

<p>Shanghai County</p>
<h3>All Agencies Give a Fond Farewell to County Chief Yan</h3>
<p>Recalling Achievements Over Three Years</p>
<p>Yan Shenyu, the county chief of Shanghai County, has been transferred to be the county chief of Wuxi County, as reported in this newspaper. On April 2nd, the Shanghai County Party Department, district offices, security groups, and county agencies held a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant to give a fond farewell to County Chief Yan as he took office in Wuxi County. Zhang Jingye, a standing committee member of the County Party Department, Zhang Yi, a supervisory committee member, and Wu Jingqing, the former district chief of the First District, gave speeches, saying that County Chief Yan had served in Shanghai County for three years and had left many achievements during those three years, which the people of the area would not forget. The main points were as follows: (1) At the beginning of his term, he completed the construction of Beihui Road. Now the road is flat, and there is no suffering from bumpy roads. Everyone praises County Chief Yan for this. (2) The relocation of the county seat to Beiqiao had been planned for a long time but had been delayed. After County Chief Yan arrived, he resolutely proceeded and completed the construction of the new building within six months. The entire staff moved to the new seat in January of this year. Moving from the most prosperous Shanghai to the extremely remote Beiqiao would not be done by someone who was not truly devoted to public service. (3) Many of the rivers and waterways in the villages were silted up. After County Chief Yan took office, he investigated the situation and believed that rivers and waterways were extremely important for transportation and irrigation. He first dredged Yutang and then ordered each district to investigate and dredge the rivers that needed to be dredged. County Chief Yan's work benefited the waters first. (4) Storing grain is an important policy for local famine preparedness. County Chief Yan knew that Shanghai only had cash reserves for grain storage and no actual grain reserves. This was not a long-term strategy in the event of a disaster. He persuaded the soybean and rice industry association to donate a large sum of money and is currently bidding to build warehouses. He also entrusted Mr. Gu to purchase 2,000 dan of rice in Wuxi as a preparation for implementing grain storage. (5) The Beiqiao bell tower is the oldest artifact, which had been in disrepair for a long time. County Chief Yan has consulted with local gentry to initiate fundraising for repairs and has already collected more than 3,000 yuan. Bidding will begin soon to preserve the artifact. County Chief Yan should be praised for this effort. (6) The county security group was ordered to be established. County Chief Yan selected personnel and trained them conscientiously. Recently, the first inspection was held, and more than 1,000 people attended. The group's skills and techniques were remarkable. The provincial committee's evaluation was very satisfactory, and the merchants and people of the county are honored by this.</p>

Therefore, it has specially appointed medical experts to organize an academic guidance committee. It is also heard that the Central National Medicine Hall, because the branch hall is a model for the whole country, has hired Mr. Li Shizeng, who has returned from a study tour in Europe, to guide everything in the hall. The already announced guiding committee members are listed below: Yun Tieqiao, Xu Xiaotu, Zhu Weiju, Shen Zhongfang, Xu Xinsun, Yu Botao, Bao Chengliang, Xue Yishan, Tan Ganchen, Ni Songjian, etc.</p>

<h3>Holding a Ningbo-Shaoxing Circulation Exhibition</h3>
<p>Sending Representatives Tomorrow Night to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products is making considerable efforts to promote the sales of national products. In this year's program, special attention is paid to promoting trade. In order to awaken the concept of national products among the people of Ningbo and Shaoxing counties and to promote national products for the year, it was decided to lead all Shanghai national product factories in holding mobile national product exhibitions in Ningbo and Shaoxing after the conclusion of the membership conference in Anhui. The purpose is to give local people in those areas the opportunity to recognize and use national products, thereby expanding the national product movement and concentrating national salvation forces. Xu Jianruo and Yang Yucheng were elected by the Executive Committee to go to negotiate and actively prepare. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce supports this work and has sent letters to the Yinxian and Yuyao County Chambers of Commerce to lead, preside over, and assist in the process. Wang Xiaolai and Wu Zhihao also sent letters to leaders from all walks of life in those areas to assist in the work and ensure a successful event. It is heard that the two representatives, Xu and Yang, are scheduled to take a boat to Ningbo tomorrow night to begin their work.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, saying: "On the 31st of this month, we received a joint letter from the Brick and Ash Factory Industry Association and the Lime Distribution Company Industry Association, stating that according to recent reports, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to rectify business tax collection, has established a special business tax for lime, brick, and tile kiln industries and has appointed Wu Xunchen as the business tax commissioner, who will set up an office to begin work immediately. The collection regulations and detailed rules have also been drafted and will be officially announced after being resolved at the next provincial government regular meeting. After reading this, we were extremely apprehensive. The lime, brick, and tile kiln industries are handicrafts and also sideline occupations for farmers. In recent years, business has been sluggish, and bankruptcy is imminent. The government has no time to help, so how can it impose a special tax and severely destroy them? Moreover, the business tax for lime, bricks, and tiles is being collected separately. Now, a sudden change is made, which violates the principle of one tax per item. The future of business under this harsh disturbance is unimaginable. Our association feels sorry for the decline of the lime industry and is deeply concerned that the new tax will be unbearable for the industry. In addition to the joint office of the Jiangsu Provincial Lime, Brick, and Tile Kiln Industries sending a telegram to the provincial government requesting the withdrawal of the order and continuing to collect taxes according to the previous business tax collection method, we are sending a special letter to your association, based on your consistent commitment to protecting merchants and the people, to promptly forward this matter to the provincial government and argue reasonably for the abolition of the new tax and the restoration of the old practices in order to revive business and stabilize livelihoods. This is truly a public service. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows, Shi." It is found that the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Regulations on Business Tax are based on the Business Tax Law, and all kinds of businesses are within its scope. Moreover, according to the Business Tax Law, except for the items listed in Article 10 that may temporarily be subject to the original tax rate, all others should be governed by the law. If a certain type of business is singled out to establish a separate tax bureau and separately enact regulations, this would be a violation of the tax law and an attempt to revive the special business tax in Jiangsu Province, a disguised form of likin. National government orders are concerned, and it does not seem right to go back and forth like this. Based on the aforementioned information, we respectfully request that your ministry review and approve it and submit it to the Executive Yuan for strict orders to correct it. This would truly be a public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows, Shi."</p>
<p>Fishermen and Merchants Continue to Oppose Fee Collection</p>
<p>The Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry, because of the collection of the 2% Fisheries Construction Fee, has aroused the opposition of fishermen and merchants. Yesterday, Zhou Qianlin, Xin Xiaogen, and others from the Ningbo Hubang Fishermen and Merchants presented a petition to the Central Political Council and the National Government. The original text is copied below: "Petition for the Fisheries Construction Fee, which is impossible to bear. We earnestly request that you promptly order the Ministry of Industry to postpone the collection in order to maintain the people's livelihood. We, the merchants, received a notice from the Shanghai Fisheries Association, attached with nine articles of the Provisional Rules for the Collection of Fisheries Construction Fees approved by the Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Jiangzhe Region under the Ministry of Industry. After hearing the order, we were all alarmed and said that at this time, the fishery industry has declined to the extreme. Relying on the government to maintain it is not enough, but on the contrary, it wants to collect a disguised form of fishing tax, which is what the fishermen and merchants of the two seas feel the most painful about. This is the first reason why we cannot bear the construction fee. The collection rules state that this construction fee will be collected by the fish market on behalf of the fishermen and merchants. According to the fishing industry's habits, fishermen catch fish in the sea, and fishermen and merchants transport and sell them in the city. Therefore, most of the goods sold by the fish market are transported by fishermen and merchants. If the construction fee is deducted by the fish market, it will actually become the sole responsibility of the fishermen and merchants. This is the second reason why we cannot bear the construction fee. The Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Jiangzhe Region's collection of this construction fee is based on the Ministry of Industry's plan to rectify the fishery industry and has been approved by the Central Political Committee with the instruction to carefully handle it with reference to established rules. In recent years, Japanese fishing intrusions have caused the coastal fishing industry to plummet. Our government has seen the situation clearly and, in March of the 20th year of the Republic, issued an order to exempt fishing tax and fishery tax. There are established rules for tax exemption, and there are established rules for drawing taxes according to the tonnage of the ship during the taxation era, but the Ministry of Industry has not taken them into consideration. The Ministry of Industry has set the value of the construction fee to be 2% of the value, which is construction in name but collection in reality. This is the third reason why we cannot bear the construction fee. We are in deficit year after year and are now on the verge of collapse. Taking the Shanghai port as an example, imported goods are subject to strict inspections by the customs and salt bureau and are registered by the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the local government's navigation administration, sanitation, public utility, and finance bureaus. The business of fresh goods is already extremely difficult. Compared with imported foreign goods, which are taxed only once and allowed to pass through the entire country, it is inevitable that we will cut off our own livelihoods. This is the fourth reason why we cannot bear the construction fee. Therefore, after repeated discussions, we cannot bear any further burden, and fishermen and merchants cannot bear it alone. We have no choice but to ask the government to show extraordinary compassion, to consider the critical state of the fishing industry, and to approve and promptly order the Ministry of Industry to postpone the implementation of the construction fee rules so that fishermen and merchants can temporarily maintain the status quo and the national economy and the people's livelihood will also benefit. We cannot express the urgency of our request to await orders. Respectfully submitted to the Central Political Council, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan by fishermen and merchants Zhou Qianlin, Xin Xiaogen, Cao Chiyou, Wang Ruirong, etc."</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers of Sichuan Commemorate Wang Runbo</h3>
<p>Who Sacrificed His Life in the Anti-Japanese War at Gubeikou</p>
<p>The Sichuan Kai County Beijing-Shanghai Student Federation held a meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday at the Shanghai Lawyers Association Hall at the intersection of Avenue Beller and Route Lafayette in the French Concession to commemorate Wang Runbo, the commander of the regiment who sacrificed his life in the Anti-Japanese War. Many people attended. After the meeting began as planned, Wei Anzhi of the Central Committee reported that the martyr graduated from the third class of the Whampoa Military Academy, dedicated himself to the revolution, and possessed a spirit of sacrifice. He was currently the commander of the 149th Regiment of the 25th Division of the National Army. He took the lead in resisting Japan at Gubeikou and died in battle. His loyalty, bravery, and greatness can be used as a model. He also gave a speech calling out slogans such as "The spirit of martyrs never dies" and "Defeat the enemy." The eulogy is attached below: "On the 3rd day of the 4th month of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the fellow villagers of Kai County in Beijing and Shanghai respectfully offer flowers and pure fruits and sincere hearts to the portrait of Wang Runbo, the regimental commander who sacrificed his life in the Anti-Japanese War, and mourn with a text, saying, alas, the violent Japanese invaded, for half a century. They forcibly occupied the eastern provinces, attacked Shanghai, have not extinguished their ambitions, and the flames of the invaders are increasing. They advanced their troops to the customs and seized Jehol, burning, killing, raping, and plundering without restraint. Justice and peace are completely destroyed. We hate our superiors, who did not resist at all, abandoned their posts, and led the invaders into our home. Chengde was lost, and Peiping and Tianjin were alarmed. Outside the Great Wall, the invaders were rampant and wanted to destroy us and dominate the East. Only our martyr, disregarding his own life, led his troops north to Gubeikou to resist the invaders, and the campaign was launched on a large scale. He was the bravest of the three armies, and the enemy was discouraged. He charged into battle, annihilated the enemy on the battlefield, fought hard in isolation, and could not last long. The enemy outnumbered us, and you died in battle. Alas, martyr, how magnificent is your spirit! Wrapped in horsehide, a man's ambition is strong. Your great achievements will last forever. Taking benevolence and righteousness, inspiring the weak and timid, the martyr's death is the light of the nation. Alas, please accept our offerings."</p>
<p>Public Works Department</p>
<h3>Planning to Discuss Taxpayer Special Meeting Proposals</h3>
<p>Proposing Factory Licensing</p>
<p>And Improving Election Procedures</p>
<p>At the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department on February 29, the Director-General proposed that Article 34 of the Land Regulations be amended to allow for the licensing of factories, and that Article 18 of the Regulations should also be slightly amended to improve the procedures for electing directors. Both proposals were approved by the Board of Directors and will be submitted to a special meeting of taxpayers for approval. Regarding the proposal to change the procedures for electing directors, it is proposed to change the current registered voting to anonymous voting. The voting time will be extended from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM (the current regulation is from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM). The number of ballot counters will also be increased from the original two to expedite the announcement of the election results. The Public Works Department has also asked Mr. A.W. Burkill to serve as chairman of the taxpayer annual meeting and special meeting.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Shanghai Consumer Association</h3>
<p>The organization of consumer cooperatives is popular in European and American countries, but although such organizations exist in our country, they are not as prevalent as in Europe and America. Xu Xinliu, Sun Zhongli, Sun Zhongping, Wang Zimin, Gu Zhanran, Guan Hanguang, and other celebrities in Shanghai's business community, in view of this, founded the Shanghai Consumer Association, which has been established for more than a week and has done a great deal of work. The goods managed by the association are delivered directly to each household by producers' own vehicles, and the prices are calculated according to market prices. However, according to the association's methods, every three months, all surpluses, after deducting expenses, are refunded to users in proportion to the amount of purchases. According to cooperative practice, purchases must be paid in cash. Payment locations include the Zhongfu Bank on Renji Road, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road, and the North Suzhou Road, Hongkou, Avenue Joffre, Jing'an Temple Road, and Ximen branches. Alternatively, checks payable to the association can be mailed. Those who do not wish to pay cash each time can deposit a deposit of more than 30 yuan at the Zhongfu Bank or Zhejiang Industrial Bank or its branches, and then they can use the phone to notify the association to make purchases at any time. The association's accounts are audited by the well-known MegsrsLoveBinghamandMatthemg Accounting Firm, and profits are announced every three months to ensure credibility. The association's address is Room 509, No. 25 Renji Road. The ordering location is in the Zhongfu Bank on Renji Road, and the agency is the Zhejiang Industrial Bank Zhongfu Bank and its branches.</p>

<h3>A Bomb at Deshengxiang on Avenue Edward VII Last Night</h3>
<p>Injured a shop assistant, Gu Qichang</p>
<p>Destroyed a large central glass window</p>
<p>Bei Zaixin, a local businessman who is a major dealer in foreign goods and piece goods, has successively opened several large-scale foreign goods and cloth stores in the French Concession. Deshengxiang at 71-73 Rue du Moulin was founded by Bei and has been around for more than a decade. In December of last year, because the place was being rebuilt, it moved to 121-123 Zhengjia Muqiao Street (363-365 Avenue Edward VII) as usual, and the scale was larger than before, and the scope was further expanded. The number of employees in the store has increased to more than 30. Recently, business has been so busy that they cannot handle it all. At 7:15 PM yesterday, someone suddenly threw a bomb at the entrance of the store. With a loud bang, it destroyed a large central glass window facing Zhengjia Muqiao Street. Fortunately, everyone in the store was having dinner at the time, and only three or five people were guarding the door. Hearing the sound, they all fled in panic. One of the shop assistants, Gu Qichang (31 years old, from Suzhou), was injured in the left arm because he was directly in the line of fire. By the time everyone arrived, the person who threw the bomb had disappeared without a trace. They immediately reported to the Great Clock Police Station. The chief immediately ordered detectives to investigate. They collected the fragments of the bomb one by one and temporarily stored them at the police station for investigation. At the same time, the injured shop assistant, Gu, was sent to the Renji Hospital. However, the injury was not serious and there was no major problem.</p>
<h3>YWCA 25th Anniversary Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA is scheduled to hold its 25th anniversary meeting at 6:00 PM on Friday, the 7th of this month, on the third floor of Building C, No. 8 Yuanmingyuan Road. Hundreds of invitations have been sent to directors and members, but because the members' addresses have changed after the Shanghai war, the mailmen could not find them and many letters have been returned. It is hoped that all members who hear of this will be able to attend the meeting on their own. In addition to reporting and discussing association affairs and re-electing directors, there will also be a large-scale dinner. On this day, when the weather is sunny and the wind is gentle, it is expected that Chinese and foreign ladies will gather together, with talent gathered and high spirits flying.</p>
<h3>Rudolph Friml, the World-Renowned Composer, Comes to China</h3>
<p>Rudolph Friml, the world-renowned composer, was previously known for composing the operettas "Rose-Marie" and "The Vagabond King." The operas were performed in New York and London for more than a year and sold very well, which was greatly welcomed by the locals. His lyrics, such as "Rose-Marie" and "Indian Love Call," were especially popular. Recently, he came to China some time ago to collect Chinese folk music in preparation for composing an opera to be performed in Europe and America. He is staying at the Cathay Hotel. He has collected considerable material in Beijing, Hong Kong, and other places for his opera about China. After arriving in Shanghai, he plans to collect more material to make it perfect. He has named it "The Singing Girl." When this drama is performed in Europe and America in the future, it will definitely introduce the essence of our Chinese folk music to the public in those countries. Friml will stay in Shanghai for a considerable amount of time and has been scheduled for receptions by Shao Xunmei.</p>
<h3>Idling Workers at the Qiuxin Shipyard Have Resumed Work</h3>
<p>The French-owned Qiuxin Shipyard in the Nanshi Shanghai Military Camp has more than 300 workers. Recently, Ren Wenxing, the foreman of the fitter shop, colluded with Westerners to hire private individuals and dismissed three old workers, Sun Jiayue, Chen Mingjin, and Dai Renyang, which caused the opposition of workers in all departments of the factory. The fitter shop went on strike yesterday morning (it is not accurate to say that all workers went on strike, because seven departments, including coppersmiths, carpenters, single-bed founders, iron factories, cold workers, and laborers, did not participate). The Qiuxin Trade Union of the First District Shipbuilding Industry sent Guan Rongqing and Wang Ronggen to petition the Party and government at 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Sheng of the Municipal Party Department received them and promised to handle it together with the Social Affairs Bureau. Wang Xianqing of the Social Affairs Bureau received them and immediately went to investigate the truth. At 3:00 PM, Wang Xianqing of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with Zhao Erchang of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Genrong and Shu Ashi of the Shipbuilding Trade Union of the First District, went to the Qiuxin Factory to mediate. The foreman, Mai Renluoli, accepted the mediation. As a result, work was resumed. Chen Mingjin and Dai Deyang had been working for only two months, and the trade union stipulated that they could not be guaranteed, so they were allowed to be dismissed. Both parties agreed at the time, and the matter was resolved. The workers resumed work at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Loss of Public Buses in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>The chairman's report at the shareholders' meeting of the China General Omnibus Company stated that the company's business situation last year, as known to the shareholders in the report, was generally affected by the current situation. Several factors were significant, and they are briefly described as follows: The business in January started quite promisingly, and a small profit could be obtained. However, at the end of the month, the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war caused numerous obstacles, resulting in a sharp decline in revenue. This was due to the shortening of routes, especially in the northern district, which was the worst affected. As the war zone in that area could not be restored soon, the loss in that district alone was 120,000 taels compared to the previous year. Our company, being a public utility, had a contract with the Public Works Department. Despite the adverse circumstances, we had to maintain the operation of vehicles as much as possible for the convenience of the citizens. Therefore, we reported to the shareholders' meeting last year that, due to the needs of the Public Works Department, to solve the problem of passenger congestion, we added 44 new diesel engine chassis. Our factory assembled the bodies ourselves, and including the construction of new garages, it cost a total of 1,087,000 taels. This amount was raised from new shares issued in June last year. A total of 1 million taels of new shares were sold at a 1% discount. Before the increase in new shares, the interest alone had reached 92,481 taels. Unexpectedly, after the new vehicles were assembled, it was realized that the impact of the destruction of Zhabei meant that all 44 new vehicles could not be fully utilized. Although efforts were made to allocate the new vehicles to other routes, the number of passengers was limited, resulting in huge losses. Our company has been racking its brains over this issue. Fortunately, a temporary solution has now been devised: to have the special cars that run to the central district twice in the morning and afternoon park in the central district and wait until office hours are over, then load passengers and drive back to the original station. This can save several empty trips back and forth, slightly reducing the waste. Last year, our company intended to purchase six double-decker buses for trial use. Our company's chief engineer contacted the director of the public utility in London and agreed on the type of purchase. However, the traffic situation has changed recently. Since the purchased vehicles cannot be fully utilized, the plan to purchase double-decker buses has also been suspended. Last year, due to the impact of the war, the prices of copper coins and foreign currency both fell. Banks and money houses restricted lending, and the market became increasingly depressed, with unemployment increasing, especially among dock workers. Dock workers' wages were usually calculated in copper coins. With more unemployment, the circulation of copper coins decreased, and with the fall in foreign currency prices, this loss alone reached 106,634 taels. As the social situation becomes more serious, labor unrest is more likely to occur. Therefore, on August 11, there was a strike by ticket sellers. To maintain traffic, our company had to send other people to take over. However, the losses suffered were still significant. Our company has repeatedly advised the workers that their own interests depend on the company's business development. However, although there is a bonus system, it has not been very effective. The company has long known about ticket fraud, so it has installed rotary machines in a few cars for trial. The results are quite satisfactory. The rest of the cars are also planned to be fully equipped one after another. The most noteworthy thing about the strike in August last year was the work slowdown by the Korean ticket inspectors. Although the company repeatedly advised them, their attitude was tough, so our company had no choice but to dismiss them all and replace them with Russian ticket inspectors. Fortunately, they performed quite well and were able to fulfill their duties. Last year, our company intended to reduce the scope of its business and lay off employees. After careful study, the original proposal was canceled. This was because the social and livelihood situation had reached an extreme point. If labor unrest were to be incited again, I am afraid that the social situation would become more chaotic. Therefore, based on the above situation, the losses suffered by our company were an unavoidable fact. The total loss last year was 254,584 taels, 3 mace, and 9 fen, which has been recorded in the profit and loss account. Excluding the surplus of 50,606 taels and 4 fen from the previous year, there is still a loss of 203,968 taels, 3 mace, and 5 fen. Under the asset section in the business report, the value of the land is the same as last year. The house has a new garage item. All the purchased vehicles have been explained in detail above. I believe that it seems to be too much to have the above-mentioned additions and construction in the same year. The addition to the factory is roughly for the machines for making car bodies, electric drills, punching machines, and stoves. The items on the car are roughly the special copper coins used for the rotary machines, and the uniforms and furniture for the Russian ticket inspectors increased by 5,208 taels and 6 fen, mostly for the new garage and office. The inventory account decreased by 57,580 taels, 0 mace, and 2 fen compared to last year because all the car body materials have been gradually used up. The miscellaneous accounts owed by the room have been settled. The rest of the small accounts that are not reliable have also been dealt with. As for the liabilities, as mentioned before, the capital increased by 1 million taels. Under the depreciation discount item, 172,392 taels have been allocated, and a total of 499,936 taels, 1 mace, and 1 fen are stored. It is found that the average value of each vehicle is 14,750 taels, excluding the smaller ones. It should be noted that all 44 new vehicles are also calculated in the depreciation. In addition to the depreciation accumulation of 499,936 taels, 1 mace, and 1 fen, 102,000 taels were also spent on repairing old cars. All the gasoline engines on the cars have been replaced with diesel engines. All the old solid tires have been replaced with new pneumatic tires, so all the existing vehicles are equivalent to new cars and can be used for many years. The loan from the Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. is guaranteed by the company's bonds. This bond is guaranteed by the company's assets. All accounts owed have been paid off. Last year, the situation was unstable. Although there are various statistics, they are not sufficient to be regarded as a business standard. The more important ones are listed below for reference: 4,836,164 passengers, 4,364,607 miles, 46.631 miles per accident, 463,069,392 copper coins in income, which is 3,300 tons. It is really difficult to predict the company's business prospects. The Zhabei area is unlikely to recover for a while, and the exchange rate of steel coins is also unlikely to rise. I only hope that all the vehicles of our company can be utilized as much as possible to avoid waste, and that strikes will not be seen again, then we can hope that there will be a surplus soon. It is now found that the daily income has gradually improved, and I am convinced that it can continue to be maintained in the future.</p>
<h3>Xin Chang He Ran Aground on Reef</h3>
<p>Lost course in Konglin Shoal</p>
<p>Meilu sent to tow rescue</p>
<p>The Xin Chang He ship (formerly Qing He) owned by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which runs the upper reaches of the Yangtze River between Yichang and Chongqing, loaded passengers and cargo from Chongqing the day before yesterday and headed to Yichang. Yesterday afternoon, when it arrived at the Konglin Shoal downstream, it lost its course and ran aground on a reef. The shipowner immediately sent a telegram for help. After receiving the telegram, a nearby British warship immediately sailed to protect it. The company also sent the Meilu ship to the scene to unload the cargo and passengers from the ship to make it float and try to tow it. It is reported that the ship was fully loaded with goods from Chongqing this time, so the Meilu ship needs to unload twice to complete the unloading. It is said that a small amount of cargo was slightly damp.</p>
<h3>Fashion Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The reason is that the capital has repeatedly reduced wages</p>
<p>Fashion clothing workers in this city have been brewing labor unrest for a long time due to the capital (that is, various fashion companies) reducing wages. It broke out suddenly yesterday morning. More than 200 garment workers from about a dozen fashion companies in the Fourth Road area went on strike. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The cause of the labor unrest The fashion clothing industry is an emerging industry. The wages in this industry were quite high at the beginning. A coat cost about five or six yuan each. Later, due to the increasing number of workers, in order to compete with each other, there were several reductions. At present, the price per piece is 2 yuan and 4 jiao, and small clothes are calculated at 20% discount, and large clothes are added 2 jiao each, which is twice as much as the initial stage. In October last year, some workers voluntarily went on strike. After holding on for about a week, they agreed on conditions before resuming work, but they did not sign the agreement. Recently, more than ten companies including Huamei wanted to reduce it again, which caused this labor unrest.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Strike At 8 am yesterday, the union believed that the capital had repeatedly reduced wages and sent a letter to the Western Clothing Industry Association on March 17, requesting them to stop it. However, more than half a month has passed and there has been no reply. The labor side believed that the capital had no intention of reconciliation, so it jointly organized more than 200 workers from more than ten companies including Daxin, Xinhua, Huamei, Meida, Xinfeng, Limei, Jintai Xiang, Huaxin, Aina, and Yixin to voluntarily leave the store and go on strike, and planned to submit it to the party and government for mediation.</p>
<p>The capital stated According to the persons in charge of Daxin and Xinhua, the wages of garment workers are not uniform. For example, Hongxiang on Nanjing Road has higher wages, and the various companies on Fuzhou Road are also different. Some range from 2 yuan and 1 or 2 jiao to 3 yuan per piece. It always depends on the size of the business of each company. This year is different from previous years. The situation is like this, and everyone has their own difficulties. However, some companies have slightly increased their wages. It must be uniformly implemented by the resolution of the Fashion Industry Association, and they are determined not to act alone, etc.</p>
<h3>Declaration by Vegetable Stall Operators on Lime Road</h3>
<p>Oppose relocation to Lujiabang</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Lime Road vegetable stalls, because the Public Security Bureau believes that they are obstructing traffic, specifically issued a notice to the vendors on the 29th of last month, ordering them to relocate to Lujiabang for business. The vegetable stall operators believe that it will hinder the livelihood of 3,000 family members, old and young, and have requested the municipal government to order the Municipal Public Security Bureau to withdraw its order, and issued a declaration, which briefly states that Lujiabang has few people and no business to operate, and the place is full of dust and the vegetables are unhygienic, and when it rains, the water is deep enough to immerse the shins, the buyers are hesitant, and there is no stall to set up. Therefore, they list various reasons for opposition and request assistance from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>After the tragic death of the female fortune teller Wen Ying, her mother cried out for injustice</h3>
<p>Taking Diao Ao Ke as the point of attack</p>
<p>Has been to the East Shanghai Road several times</p>
<p>The long jacket has a very detailed account of the deeds</p>
<p>Went to the First Special Court again yesterday to complain</p>
<p>The female fortune teller Wen Ying studied under the tutelage of Diao Ao Ke Cheng Meixian since she was a child. Later, Cheng came to Shanghai from Hangzhou, so that he could teach fortune telling, so he also brought Wen Ying to Shanghai. Wen Ying has grown up over the years, and her art has been learned, so she went out to the world and met Fan Hongsheng. At first, the relationship was very close, and then it turned into a feud. Last summer, she was brutally killed by Fan. At that time, the police believed that Cheng Meixian was not without suspicion, and first arrested him. After Fan Hongsheng was detected, no evidence involving Cheng was found, so he was released on bail, and only Fan was prosecuted. After repeated trials by the First Special District Local Court, Fan Hongsheng was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the crime of murder. After the confirmation, he was sent to prison long ago. As for Wen Ying's mother, Wu Huang, her private lawsuit against Fan for damages has also been won, but Fan is in prison and has no financial resources to implement the judgment. Therefore, Wu Huang has filed a criminal complaint against Cheng Meixian for instigating murder, but the First Special Court and the Second High Branch Court have successively believed that the evidence is insufficient and rejected it. The woman was very dissatisfied, and specially made a long yellow oilcloth jacket that reached the knees, added to the cheongsam. On the front and back of the jacket, the story of her daughter Wen Ying entering Cheng's school to learn art and being killed by Fan was described in regular script. In the middle, it was mentioned that Cheng Meixian bribed Fan with 500 yuan to confess to being the murderer, so that Cheng could escape punishment, so Cheng is still at large today. She also made a square flag of more than two feet in the same color, and the words on it were the same as the jacket. It is said that the woman wears this dress, carries this flag, and wears a cloth bag containing documents around her chest, and repeatedly takes the Beijing-Shanghai train to the capital, and appeals to the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Supreme Court, and other yamen, seeking justice for her dead daughter. For several months, the woman's footprints have been seen in the Beijing-Shanghai train. As for how the Central Court responded to her appeal, it is not clear. However, the woman made this special dress again yesterday morning and ran to the First Special District Local Court. Those who saw it were surprised and gathered around to watch the deeds written on her clothes and flags. According to the woman, today is the opening of the execution court for her case of Fan Hongsheng's compensation for losses, so she came to wait for the trial. The woman was confused at first because she did not know the address of the court, and then she knew it was the 12th court, so she sat outside the door of the court and frequently told the audience about her daughter's death until the judge came to court for trial.</p>
<h3>You Weiwu Apologizes to Xue Jinyuan</h3>
<p>丨Declaring that the facts listed are false丨</p>
<p>Ms. Xue Jinyuan, a Cantonese socialite, was once sensationalized when an Italian, You Weiwu, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, alleging that she had enticed his son, Ji Shifu. Before long, You hastily withdrew the lawsuit on his own initiative, and the storm calmed down. People in the society all thought that the two parties had probably reached a reconciliation. In fact, the behind-the-scenes brewing was very intense. Xue did not want to give up after You withdrew the lawsuit, and also hired lawyers Jiang and Ping to actively seek legal solutions. Finally, with the mediation of friends of both parties, You also deeply regretted the rash accusation, and entrusted his agent lawyer to send a letter to Ms. Xue a few days ago, expressing his apology. According to lawyer Jiang Yiping, he also showed a letter in Western writing from You Weiwu to Xue, which briefly said: "Dear Madam, when the lawyer previously hired by me submitted a criminal complaint accusing you in the Shanghai Special District Court, the facts listed in it were fabricated and not true, and contrary to the facts. I have immediately submitted a statement to withdraw the case. However, because of the false facts listed in the complaint, you have been indirectly damaged in society. I feel very sorry, and I especially send this letter to apologize. Please publish this letter publicly, so that the social misunderstanding of your misfortune can be completely eliminated, and your perfect reputation can be immediately restored. This is addressed to Ms. Xue Jinyuan." According to Mr. Jiang's intention, since You Weiwu has admitted his mistake, as long as the truth is revealed, he may no longer pursue it in order to settle the matter. Ms. Xue also expressed her opinion yesterday, saying that the cause of this incident was entirely caused by a car accident. At that time, I believed that You Yu, the driver, was responsible, so I was unwilling to take the blame for others. Unexpectedly, he would harbor resentment and slander me, but the crimes he accused me of were not supported by any evidence, and were completely slanders with the words "may have". I really asked myself that I had nothing else, and it was not difficult to deal with him in law, but now that he has sent a letter to apologize, the truth has been revealed, and I have come to the Qingbai family and do not want to go to court with him. According to Jinyuan's younger brother Jinshou, "This case is really a joke. If my sister really has an ambiguous affair, how can our parents keep her? Even our brothers would not want to remain silent and go unpunished. There is no need for legal sanctions. Our family will immediately sanction her ourselves. Because we know that my sister is innocently slandered, we try our best to help her, so that the truth can be revealed. There are many women in our country who associate with foreigners. If this trend is opened, it is inevitable that there will be successors who harbor resentment and slander. Now that the other party has realized his mistake and sent a letter to apologize, the truth of this case has been revealed, and all the details can be understood."</p>
<h3>Sino-German Aviation to Conduct Test Flight Next Month</h3>
<p>New purchased aircraft to fly from Germany to Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-German aviation flight, the Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Li Jingcong, manager of Eurasia Aviation Company, yesterday morning at the company. According to him, the plan for Eurasia's flight has been planned for a long time, but it has not been realized due to various reasons. It was recently reported from Berlin that the Sino-German flight has been scheduled to start on May 1, but according to what I know, in order to develop the aviation industry, Eurasia Aviation Company previously ordered five aircraft from Germany. Two aircraft have been shipped to Shanghai by sea and are being assembled. The remaining three aircraft are scheduled to fly from Germany via Russia to Shanghai in May, as the first test flight between China and Germany. The Sino-German route is 9,000 kilometers long, so it will take six days to reach. After the aircraft arrives in Shanghai for a test flight, the test flight process will be studied in detail, and then the flight date will be decided. As for the Northwest route, it has been opened to Dihua. From Dihua to Tacheng, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve for a while because the place is remote and sparsely populated, and there are very few passengers and mail.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Shares in China Airlines American Stocks</h3>
<p>Planning to Open Air Routes Between China and the United States</p>
<p>China Airlines is a joint venture between China and the United States. The Chinese side accounts for 55% of the shares, and the US side accounts for 45%. The American stocks have now been sold to United Airlines in the United States. The representative of United Airlines has also arrived in Shanghai a few days ago to formally negotiate and will be established soon. However, this move has nothing to do with Chinese stocks. It is a transfer procedure outside the company. However, it is said that this move by United Airlines has a plan to directly open air routes between China and the United States.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Children's Paradise Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Children's Paradise founded by Shanghai National Products Company is scheduled to open at 10 am today. Mr. Yang Liangbi, the director of the park, has invited Mr. Wang Xiaxuan's son, Wang Daren, and Mr. Li Minwei's son, Li Keng, to perform the opening ceremony. Mr. Ren Jinping's son, Ren Chaojun, will serve as the manager. During the opening, an event film will be made to commemorate the park's efforts to work in the children's cause. Mr. Yang also issued a declaration to express his advocacy for running the children's paradise and to commemorate the grand opening of the park, and gave away commemorative coupons. The declaration is recorded below: The people are the foundation of the country, and the children are the source of the people. To save the country and strengthen the species, we must start by cultivating children and implement the ancient training of ten years of accumulation and ten years of education. Accumulation is the responsibility of parents, and education is the common responsibility of parents and those who have teachers and those who have contact with children in all aspects. We are people who are in commercial contact with children. We must be organized and fulfill our due responsibility to children. We have specially founded a children's paradise in the company to collect various national products related to children's use for children to purchase and to serve children. We use the method of persuading children to love national products to encourage children to love the country and to build a basic force for advocating national products. In addition to persuading children to love national products and encouraging children to love the country, we also need to organize children's literary clubs to assist children in their academic progress and to plan to hold various gatherings that are beneficial to children. We hope that children will all be happy to be friends with us.</p>
<p>In addition, the China National Products Company (Nanjing Road Continental Bazaar) held a children's amusement market, which opened today. There are more than 20 children's supplies in the market. All the daily necessities of children are on display. The city is divided into Zhongshan Avenue, National Products Avenue, O O Road, Tianzhen Road, Lively Road, Run Road, Jump Road, Zhongshan Park, Mayor's Office, etc. If you buy more than 5 jiao, you can draw a coupon and get exquisite gifts. The spring sale is only for today and tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Reunion Dinner of the British Students Association</h3>
<p>The British Students Association held a reunion dinner at the Bank Association last night at around 7 pm and hosted Dr. Wu Chaoshu, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs. More than 80 members attended the meeting. The meeting began with the chairman, Chu Xingyuan, reporting the order in which the association should proceed this year, and then urged Dr. Wu to give a speech. He stood up and said that at the banquet, the speaker gave a grand speech, which often made the delicious dishes lose their appetite, which was a pity. In my opinion, it is better to speak before holding chopsticks. The language was very humorous, and the listeners smiled. He then said that all of you have returned from studying in the UK and understand the situation in the UK. There is no need for brothers to say more. However, the character of the British and Chinese people is briefly described. Both Chinese and British people are conservative. For example, a friend of mine graduated from Lincoln University and visited the school again after 60 years. He saw a piece of paper in the library still in its original place, which shows the conservatism of the British people. However, how can the Chinese people's adherence to ancient methods not be as good as that? When the country was closed, they only knew how to stick to the old rules. Since the Qing Dynasty opened up trade, they only knew how to imitate the European style and follow others everywhere. But how do they know that the customs and human feelings of China and foreign countries are not completely consistent? For example, the key to ordinary secondary schools in the UK is to cultivate a noble personality, so that students can be on the right track, and they can be responsible in the society in the future. Chinese students are still far away from this. I hope that all of you present will bear their responsibility at this time of national crisis and turn the tide. It would be a great honor, etc. Finally, take a photo and have fun.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association and Others Negotiated the New Water Case Law Yesterday</h3>
<p>Decided to Make a Final Decision After a Month's Trial</p>
<p>After the Public Concession Water Company installed water meters, which caused water cut-off disputes, Feng Bingnan participated in the mediation and was mediated by the committee. After several weeks of research, several trial methods were obtained and implemented on April 1. The Real Estate Owners Association believes that the matter is of great importance, and specially convened a temporary meeting yesterday. The representatives of the owners who attended were Su Zonghan, Zhuang Yisun, Mou Zikuan, Yan Baogui, Cao Libao, Shen Mingliao, Li Bohan, Lu Hanting, Wang Zengquan, Zhao Ziyu, and other more than 50 people. Chairman Huang Yanfang discussed the newly established trial methods. Each representative presented their opinions and decided to print the new methods and send them to the tenants. Starting from April, the owners paid 7.5% of the rent for water bills. If the tenants still do not conserve water and waste water, resulting in an increase in water bills, the tenants must pay them themselves, and the owners are not responsible. However, it is very doubtful whether this fixed amount of gallons can be used for water conservation for a month. Therefore, it is generally believed that one month is the trial period. If the result is good, they will support it. Otherwise, they will unanimously and resolutely oppose it. According to a certain lane that has been cut off water, the date of the water cut-off forced by the water company can be deducted from the water bill paid in proportion.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce of Landlords Annual Meeting Speech</h3>
<p>Shanghai Landlords Association, for various problems between landlords and tenants, held an annual meeting last Friday (March 31st) to discuss. The following is a record of the speech by the chairman of the association. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, the report and accounts have already been submitted to you. If you invite everyone to approve, I will follow the usual practice and treat them as having been read. Regarding the accounts, there is not much to add. At the end of last year, the balance in the HSBC Bank was 4,579 taels, 8 mace, and 6 fen of silver, while at the end of 1931, it was 4,533 taels and 2 fen. Overall, I believe that the economic position of our association is satisfactory. However, the membership fees received this year are less than last year, which is also because last year we received outstanding membership fees. Before passing the accounts, I would like to briefly mention the matters handled by the committee last year. At last year's annual meeting, the chairman discussed the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict and rent reductions in the war zone. He also stated that the committee had advised members and published announcements advising landlords to consider the circumstances of tenants and grant reductions or exemptions accordingly. This suggestion was widely approved, and landlords, public utility companies, and authorities subsequently reduced or exempted donations and rents, all in accordance with the number of rent reductions announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government in July. This is something we should be pleased about. As for the refusal to pay rent and other incidents after the ceasefire, and the appeals to the committee, if you want to understand the depth of the instigation, I can briefly mention one matter. Tenants of a certain property in the central district of this city demanded a two-month rent reduction due to the Sino-Japanese war. The landlord naturally refused, stating that the property was not in the war zone, and entrusted a lawyer to notify the tenants. The tenants initially responded by withdrawing their demand. Unexpectedly, the next day, the landlord received a letter from the tenants' lawyer, overturning the previous agreement and stating that the tenants refused to pay rent for February and March. If the landlord insisted, they could file a lawsuit in court, etc. There is no doubt that this matter was instigated. Therefore, the landlord decided to file a lawsuit as a test case for properties in the central district. At this time, the Tenants' Association even requested members of the Bar Association not to accept appointments in cases involving rent arrears or rent reductions, which is quite remarkable. The case was initially heard in May, and the judgment was postponed. Subsequently, a joint hearing was reopened, and the landlord won the case. This case serves as a standard for the attitude adopted by most tenants towards landlords in other cases. However, I am pleased to say that many such cases have been resolved satisfactorily. Regarding this instigation, I would like to take this opportunity to express my admiration and gratitude on behalf of the association for the assistance of the authorities. Without this assistance, our position would not be what it is today. Furthermore, the situation in Zhabei and the northeast districts, which were greatly affected by the chaos, is gradually recovering rapidly, which is quite remarkable. Last year, the chairman mentioned a proposal by a member to form branch committees to handle matters related to properties in the International Settlement, the French Concession, and areas outside the concessions, and stated that the committee would consider it. This has been done, and branch committees have been established. The Shanghai Waterworks Company's adoption of a meter system has caused disputes among tenants and landlords in this city, and our committee has also spent a lot of time considering it. In theory, charging by meter is the fairest method, but in practice, it is not so simple. Poorer tenants bear a heavier proportion of the increased costs. However, the water company is working to adjust the rates to resolve the difficulties and hopes to find a solution this year. Moreover, the Public Works Department and the water company have been discussing the reduction of water fees for low-rent tenants. The current plan is to adopt a fixed volume of water for each room indefinitely, charged at 7.5% (7.5%) of the current rent, with any excess charged at a rate to be mutually agreed upon in the future. There are two factors related to water fees: exchange rates and waste. Because the company pays interest in gold pounds, and the current silver exchange rate is low, the company has to increase its silver income to cover interest payments. This is clearly constrained by the contract between the Public Works Department and the water company. However, to be fair to the company, I must say that the company would not have been able to establish itself in Shanghai without raising capital in gold pounds at the time. If the company's new policy is to recruit new shareholders in China as much as possible, then the exchange rate issue should not be as important as before. As for water wastage, landlords can hardly prevent it. However, distributing notices and diligently repairing water pipes and fixtures can also be very helpful. But if the company could collect fees directly from the households using the water, it would be easier to prevent waste than for others. The Chinese courts provide little assistance in handling rental cases. Unless strict enforcement measures are adopted, the impact on landlords will be very detrimental, which I cannot help but mention. After a judgment is made, tenants often appeal, which takes six or seven months or longer to obtain another judgment. In some cases, rental cases can take more than a year, and by then, the tenants may have absconded, leaving behind only a few yuan's worth of movable property. In such cases, the landlord not only loses rent but also bears litigation and legal fees. In our opinion, if a tenant is three months in arrears with rent, an immediate warrant should be issued for seizure.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Society Appeals for Disaster Relief in Henan Province</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a report from Mr. Yao Shiyi of the Nanyang Branch in Henan Province, stating that the county was at the time of sowing before Qingming Festival. On March 25, the branch, accompanied by five colleagues, went to Deng County to distribute seeds on behalf of the General Association. They witnessed many disaster victims fleeing. Of those remaining, villages of one hundred households had fewer than ten households. The victims were emaciated and pale, with no semblance of humanity. They had eaten all the grass roots and tree bark. The roadsides were littered with the corpses of the starving, old and young, too numerous to count. The sounds of misery echoed across the fields, too unbearable to hear. The county magistrate and the disaster victims pleaded for assistance and relief, their voices hoarse from exhaustion. They begged for rescue. Furthermore, the Xinye County Relief Committee reported that Xinye County had suffered from military disasters, banditry, famine, and epidemics, with calamities overlapping each other. The disaster situation was becoming increasingly urgent, and there was no room for silence. It was estimated that there were about 50,000 disaster victims in the entire county, gathered in groups of thousands, crying out for food. Some lay prostrate in the alleys, their breath barely perceptible. Others lay collapsed by the roadside, their stomachs distended and their intestines twisting. Abandoned temples and dilapidated monasteries were filled with death. Stiff corpses and skeletal remains littered the ground, a heartbreaking sight beyond description. The current plan is not only to request the distribution of emergency relief to save the disaster victims but also to establish more porridge kitchens to ensure widespread coverage. There is no way to scrape together funds, and there is no magical way to create wealth. All we can do is repeatedly plead for assistance, daring to hope for timely rain and the advance distribution of relief. The association stated that due to the impact of the current situation, donations had become exhausted. The people were starving and fearful. The charitable were on the verge of bankruptcy. They wanted to help but could not, and they could not bear to do nothing. Even if they chose to provide limited assistance, it would be like a drop in the bucket, saving only a few lives. After the military disasters in Shanghai last year, the city's vitality was greatly damaged. However, there were still many generous and compassionate individuals who were willing to share their food and clothing. It is hoped that they will embrace the spirit of treating others as they would treat themselves, becoming saviors of countless families. The merit of this would be inconceivable, and the rewards would be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Zhonghui Bank Increases Capital</h3>
<p>Zhonghui Bank, established by prominent Shanghai figures such as Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, along with various capitalists, has been operating for five years. Its business has been flourishing, and its reputation is outstanding. Last year, its profits reached several hundred thousand yuan. Recently, it began construction of the nine-story Zhonghui Building on Avenue Edward VII, adjacent to the French Municipal Council, covering an area of more than three mu. It is expected to be completed this year. The original capital of one million yuan was deemed insufficient for expansion. Last month, the bank's shareholders' meeting resolved to increase the capital by one million yuan. Due to the lack of a quorum, a second shareholders' meeting was convened the day before yesterday, which unanimously passed the capital increase proposal. It is planned to increase the capital by one million yuan, with priority given to existing shareholders. More than 100,000 yuan in retained dividends from previous years can be used to offset part of the share payment. Non-existing shareholders and those who wish to subscribe for new shares in addition to their existing shareholdings can also register with the bank in advance. It is also reported that if the subscription for new shares is enthusiastic and exceeds the quota, the limit for expanding the capital increase may also be extended.</p>
<h3>Wang Shaozhuang Accused of Selling Opium</h3>
<p>Fact-Finding Postponed for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Chen Yaoting, a Chinese detective of the Anti-Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police, learned that someone was secretly selling opium in Room 317 of the Xinhuaizhong Hotel on Hankou Road. Yesterday morning at 10:30, he cooperated with Western detectives and went to investigate. They seized multiple packages of opium, each labeled with the quantity and price, as well as an account book, a letter, a pipe, and a lamp. A man from Beiping named Wang Shaozhuang was arrested and taken to the Old Gate Police Station for detention. This morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the circumstances of the arrest and stated that, based on the seized evidence, the defendant was indeed selling opium and should be prosecuted in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law and punished according to the law. Detective Chen then testified that when the defendant was arrested, he denied that his real name was Wang Shaozhuang, claiming to be Wang Fu. However, the police investigated the hotel's accounts and confirmed that he was indeed Wang Shaozhuang and had been renting the room since January 16 of this year. Wang Shaozhuang denied selling opium, admitting only to smoking it, and hired a lawyer to defend him. The lawyer argued that the defendant, Wang Shaozhuang, was a respectable businessman from a wealthy family with substantial assets in Shanghai, Beiping, and other places. He owned the Yuebinlou and Huibinlou restaurants in this city and had recently purchased a car. The amount of opium seized by the police was extremely small, which was inconsistent with the charges. He requested that the defendant be declared innocent. The police lawyer, Ru, countered that wealthy individuals were not incapable of engaging in opium dealing. The fact that the defendant owned the Yuebinlou and Huibinlou restaurants and had recently purchased a car was irrelevant to the case. Even if all the Shanghai restaurants were owned by Wang, it could not be determined that Wang Shaozhuang could not engage in the opium business. He requested that the court make its judgment based on the evidence. Judge Qian Hongye stated that further investigation was required and ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Ten of Eighteen Robbers Prosecuted by the Police</h3>
<p>Six Acquitted</p>
<p>Two Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, the Chief Inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department of the General Police, along with Inspectors Liu Shaokui, Shao Jingfan, and Feng Zhiming, previously arrested eighteen suspected robbers, including Wang Weisheng, Zhang Songyao, Sun Zhiming, Zhu Zhonggeng (also known as Genglong), Liu Qin, Chen Fuliang (staff officer of the 47th Division of the Army), Xia Xiaoxia, Zhang Yinbao, Zhang Changfu, Qian Xijiang, Qian Zhonghua, Yu Jisheng, Jin Xiaomei, Wu Zhou Shi (also known as Haiyun), Ma Afeng, Guo Liu Shi, Wu Yuchun, and Chen Zhou Shi (also known as Zhou Chuanwo), at 22 Yuehua Lane, Avenue Joffre, and 407 Pushi Road, etc. A Mauser pistol and 206 rounds of ammunition were seized on the spot. They were all escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Under questioning by Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court, they were ordered to await further hearing. It is now known that during the postponement, Chief Inspector Lu and others learned that several of the robbers had kidnapped Hu Henian's two-year-old son, Guoan, from 493 Huishan Road on February 24 of last year and hid him in Ma'ao Village, Ningbo, demanding a huge ransom. Inspector Feng Zhiming went to Ningbo and, together with the local authorities, rescued the hostage. They also learned that they had committed two other robbery cases. Yesterday morning, the hearing was resumed. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated in court that the police had found that Wang Weisheng, Zhang Songyao, Sun Zhiming, Zhu Zhonggeng, Liu Qin, Yu Jisheng, Jin Xiaomei, Wu Zhou Shi, Wu Yuchun, and Ma Afeng had committed three major cases and were formally prosecuted. Chen Fuliang and Chen Xijiang were still under investigation and would be remanded in custody. The others, including Chen Zhou Shi, Xia Xiaoxia, Zhang Yinbao, Guo Liu Shi, Zhang Changfu, and Qian Zhonghua, were requested to be released. However, the police investigation of the prosecuted cases had not been completed and requested a one-week postponement. Judge Qian questioned the defendants and ordered Chen Zhou Shi et al. to be released, while the others remained in custody for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Another Kidnapping for Ransom Criminal Apprehended</h3>
<p>Yang Changhua, a native of Anhui, was identified on Kaifeng Road by Quan Lin, the chief investigator of the Anti-Bandit Headquarters of the Jiangsu-Songhu Water Police, as Xu San Laotouzi, a known bandit who had committed kidnapping and ransom cases in Suzhou in August of last year. He and his wife, Yang Chen Shi, were arrested and escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where they were ordered to be detained pending reporting. The day before yesterday, Wang Hongpeng, an investigator from the headquarters, learned that Hong Zibing, a native of Henan residing at 457 Tokyo Road, was an accomplice of Xu San Laotouzi and was involved in the kidnapping and robbery cases committed by Xu. Therefore, at noon on that day, he requested the Shanghai Municipal Police to send detectives to arrest Hong. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested that Hong be temporarily detained pending the presentation of evidence of his banditry. After a brief interrogation, he was ordered to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>

<h3>Absurd Actions of an Absurd Doctor</h3>
<p>丨Stealing a Medicine Shop Seal to Borrow Money丨</p>
<p>Shen Haicang, a 27-year-old doctor from Songjiang, lived at 145 Maggie Road, French Concession, and practiced at the Tongfu Pharmacy at 68 Rue Pére Robert. Because Shen was spending excessively on prostitutes, he was running into financial difficulties. One day, he had an absurd idea: he stole the seal of the Tongfu Pharmacy and borrowed 150 yuan from a Mr. Wu, the owner of the Xilin Denture Shop on Wuma Road. He forged the Tongfu Pharmacy as the guarantor on the IOU and stamped it with the stolen seal as proof. Subsequently, Mr. Wu took the IOU to the Tongfu Pharmacy for inquiry and discovered the theft and forgery. The owner of Tongfu Pharmacy, Mu Kang, reported it to the police, and Detective Cheng Yulin arrested Shen and took him to the police station, where he was ordered to be detained and sent to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read the news in your newspaper on April 2 that eleven umbrella factories suddenly stopped work, saying that recently someone planned to set up a parasol market, which is very detrimental to the business of each factory, so the factories unanimously stopped work to express their firm opposition, etc., which is beyond belief. This office was established by 25 umbrella factories. The purpose is to automatically unite operations and completely adopt domestic materials. There is no monopoly on the market to harm the industry. And the eleven umbrella factories that stopped work have not joined this office and have nothing to do with this office. The contents of your newspaper are not true. Please correct it quickly, with utmost gratitude. Sincerely, Shanghai National Goods Parasol Industry Joint Business Office, April 3</p>

<h3>Can We Return to the Countryside?</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Xiong Sheng of this city丨</p>
<p>I have a question, please give public instructions in your column. Although this question is raised by me personally, I believe twelve points that many people are waiting for your instructions and give some following for those in my situation. I think, there is no need to say too much about the facts, otherwise, it will take up precious space, which is too bad, it is because I am suffering from the most fashionable disease now, 丨 unemployment. In the past, because I did not have a special skill, I now feel that I am increasingly uncertain about finding a job, and I have reached a state of despair. What should I do? Survival is still survival. 丨 I don't have the courage to commit a crime, and I don't have the courage to commit suicide. In fact, because I have an old mother and a wife and children, the environment does not allow it. As for my knowledge and ability, I am afraid that you want to know, but I am ashamed to say that I can only write these few words, and I have nothing else. However, I don't absolutely blame myself, because fundamentally, this is the reality created by the current society, and of course I cannot escape this common rule. It is really more difficult for an unemployed person to survive in the luxurious Shanghai than to climb to the sky without breaking the law. On the one hand, various agencies and stores are implementing rationalization of production and massively laying off employees, 丨 breaking the rice bowls of many people. On the other hand, the extravagance is increasing day by day, and the consumption is greatly increased. Not to mention other things, even the rent and land tax are constantly increasing, and all the increases must be borne by us common people. It is difficult for unemployed people like me to get by, and even if they are barely working, most of them are secretly complaining, and the result will definitely be difficult to return, and they will inevitably not be able to escape this inescapable net. Since it is impossible to survive in the city, then naturally there is only returning to the countryside, (now there are many people singing this tune) is the only way out. In the eyes of theorists, it is certainly very moving and can arouse the excitement of some people (and I am one of them), but there are also difficulties. Returning to the countryside is of course my wish, and there is nothing in the devilish city that eats people's blood that makes me nostalgic. I think escaping earlier is getting happiness earlier, but when I return to the countryside, I also have to fill my stomach so that I don't panic. If there is no rice to fill my stomach, I am fundamentally powerless, because I am a complete proletarian, without means of production in the city, and without the skills to make a living in the countryside, and without a house or half an acre of land. I can indeed be called extremely poor. May I ask how can I survive in this situation? How can I go back? The above is my subjective inability to return to my hometown, but objectively, can the entire countryside accommodate batches of unemployed people squeezed out of the city? The cry of rural economic bankruptcy can be heard everywhere, and in the most practical daily situation, it can also be seen that many, many people have suffered natural and man-made disasters and cannot stand on their own feet, so they rush to the city, which is not uncommon. Just look at the current situation in China, almost no province has escaped the fate of war, banditry, and natural disasters. Good land is flooded by floods and cannot be restored to cultivation. Houses and property are plundered and burned. The heavy levies of land taxes and miscellaneous taxes. And the most important thing is that since the economic forces of various imperialists have penetrated into the inland, even remote areas are filled with foreign goods, completely eliminating thousands of small handicraft workers, which is the most important reason for rural bankruptcy. In short, the entire countryside itself is unable to maintain itself, let alone settle outsiders. The above situations are all true, and although my writing is too bad, I can never obscure the true situation.</p>
<p>Finally, what I ask you to answer is whether I can return to the countryside in my current situation, and what is the most appropriate and possible way to maintain my life when I return to the countryside. Editor, I hope you will not hesitate to give me your advice, because you are the advisor of the readers, and I hope you will not lose your responsibility.</p>
<p>Answer: The phenomenon of the current society you mentioned will only be less than the reality, not more than the reality. Since the invasion of capitalism, especially international capitalism, into the Chinese countryside, on the one hand, the countryside is increasingly bankrupt and the relative surplus of the rural population is increasingly serious. Part of this surplus rural population naturally runs towards the city. So, just take Shanghai as an example. The population this year has exceeded 3.2 million. On the other hand, no matter how fast the industrial development of the city is, it cannot absorb this population. And due to the rationalization of production in capitalism, the urban population is also gradually forming a relative surplus. In short, it is not easy to find a job in the city, and it is difficult to make a living in the countryside. What you said is true. In this situation, if you want to return to the countryside for the sake of making a living, then we really don't see any optimistic prospects. Not only are there no optimistic prospects, but there is only still starving and doing rural unemployment. This problem (the unemployment problem: urban and rural) not only has no hope of being solved under the current social system in China, but even in the United States, which is known as the paradise of the world (see the New York correspondence in this newspaper on February 20: The Sorrow of American Farmers), is increasingly bankrupt and unable to resolve its own contradictions. According to the reporter's personal perspective, there is no guarantee of returning to the countryside now. As for saying "what is an appropriate and most possible way to maintain life when returning to the countryside," we have shallow views and really can't think of any way, not to mention a "appropriate" way. However, the readers may think of a good way. I would like to solemnly put forward this question and ask everyone to think about it.</p>

<h3>The China Boy Scout Headquarters Promulgates the Essentials of Boy Scout Education</h3>
<p>Deputy Commander Dai Writes in His Own Hand</p>
<p>Must-Read for Service Personnel and Members</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, has spared no effort in directly and indirectly advocating education. Since he took charge of the preparatory work for the Boy Scout General Association and served as the Deputy Commander of the Headquarters, he has been particularly concerned about Boy Scout education. It is learned that Dai recently drafted a kind of essence of education, which is precise and concise, and will be distributed to service personnel and members across the country for reading and discussion. Today is the date of the third grand review and camp of the Boy Scouts of Zhejiang Province. He went to attend in person and brought this publication, which was distributed on the spot. It is said that the text was written by Dai in his own hand and produced by zinc plate, which is solemn and beautiful. The original text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>China Boy Scout Oath</p>
<p>I swear to abide by the teachings of the Premier, to strictly observe the Boy Scout rules, and to carry out the following three things throughout my life:</p>
<p>First, to practice the teachings of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, and to be a loyal citizen of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Second, to help others and serve the public anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>Third, to strive for the soundness of my own knowledge, morality, and physique.</p>
<p>Recorded respectfully by Dai Chuanxian, March, 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the Boy Scout is clearly stated in the two oaths. The meaning of Boy Scout education is also contained in the three oaths. Those who work in the Boy Scout cause and the Boy Scout children only need to remember these three oaths clearly, explain them clearly, and do them thoroughly, and use their own life and life to prove the oath. Each person himself has made a living oath, which is to truly achieve the purpose of the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>The most important thing in doing Boy Scout work is purity. What is purity? It is that each person sincerely thinks, says, and does according to the oath he has made, word by word, without any second thought, without any second words, and without any second actions. What is said, thought, and done are completely corresponding, integrated into one, and formed into one piece, which is called purity. A group composed of such pure people is a pure group.</p>
<p>Boy Scout, Boy Scout,</p>
<p>Love my body, love my home,</p>
<p>Love my country, love my people,</p>
<p>Boy Scout, Boy Scout,</p>
<p>Love my body, strive to be a complete person,</p>
<p>Be wise, benevolent, and brave, and live up to my good youth.</p>
<p>Boy Scout, Boy Scout,</p>
<p>Love my home, my parents gave birth to me,</p>
<p>With virtue, we must surpass Dao Ying, look down on light, and repay the kindness of our parents.</p>
<p>Boy Scout, Boy Scout,</p>
<p>Love my country, sacrifice for my country,</p>
<p>The great way to save the country, national, civil, and people's rights and livelihoods,</p>
<p>Red blood and loyalty, the blue sky and white sun shine brightly, freedom and equality, we must fight for the country.</p>
<p>Boy Scout, Boy Scout,</p>
<p>Love my people, give up myself to help others,</p>
<p>Be polite and righteous, with the same heart and mind,</p>
<p>Do one good deed every day, and practice it with sincerity,</p>
<p>Be loyal and trustworthy, and the whole earth will be full of spring.</p>
<p>Boy Scout, Boy Scout,</p>
<p>A Boy Scout for a day, a Boy Scout for a lifetime,</p>
<p>When being a person, one should have ambition, and be determined to be a complete person.</p>
<p>Where did the Republic of China come from? It came from Mr. Sun.</p>
<p>Thousands of years of autocratic country, handed over to the people by one hand,</p>
<p>Five ethnic groups become one, and the Three Principles of the People are created.</p>
<p>When being a person, one should have ambition, and be determined to be like Mr. Sun,</p>
<p>Reach virtue, wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and cultivate oneself with the eight virtues,</p>
<p>Create good skills, save the country and the people,</p>
<p>Later generations must surpass the predecessors, and where there is a will, there is a way.</p>
<p>Boy Scout, Boy Scout,</p>
<p>A Boy Scout for a day, a Boy Scout for a lifetime,</p>
<p>Later generations must surpass the predecessors, and where there is a will, there is a way.</p>

<h3>Ye Hongying Donates More Than One Million Yuan in Assets to Run Libraries and Rural Education</h3>
<p>Immediately Establish the Hongying Education Fund Board of Directors</p>
<p>Invite Cai Zimin and Fifteen Others to be Directors</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Hongying, a business tycoon in Shanghai, has been doing business since childhood. He is now 74 years old. He has always been diligent and thrifty and enthusiastic about public welfare. He has created various industrial and commercial enterprises too numerous to mention. Recently, in view of the country's growing difficulties and the critical situation, the national people have not been able to fully express their patriotism because education and culture have not yet been promoted. Therefore, in order to fundamentally save the country, he vowed to donate all the assets he has worked hard and diligently to accumulate throughout his life, except for those that have already been distributed to his children and grandchildren and those with other provisions, for public welfare purposes. He specially established the Hongying Education Fund Board of Directors, which specializes in running two projects: libraries and rural primary schools. He drafted rules and submitted a document to the Ministry of Education of the National Government for approval, with a preface to the donation, and listed the details of the donated property in the rules, divided into real estate, stock cash and other parts, estimated to be worth more than one million yuan. The Ministry approved and praised it, saying that it should be approved, etc. Then Mr. Ye hired Cai Zimin, Qian Xinzhi, Mu Ouchu, Shen Xinqing, Huang Renzhi, Zhu Yinjiang, Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Jiang Wenyu, Wang Baolun, Zhu Kongjia, Gao Yanyun, Xu Qiufan, Wei Wenlun, and Mr. Ye himself, a total of fifteen people, as directors. At noon on the 3rd, a meal was held at Mr. Ye's residence on Avenue Joffre in Shanghai, inviting the directors. After the meal, a group photo was taken, and then the inaugural meeting of the board of directors was held. Mr. Ye reported on the preface to the donation and the process of obtaining approval from the Ministry of Education. Later, Cai Zimin was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, and Jiang Wenyu was the temporary recorder. After the ceremony was completed, the chairman stood up and gave a speech, expressing his admiration and respect. He compared Mr. Ye with Ye Chengzhong, Yang Sisheng, and Chen Jiageng, saying that their influence on the future of the country, society, education, and culture has made great contributions. The descendants of Mr. Ye, who have received this extraordinary reputation, will pass it on without stealing, which is incomparable to leaving property to their children. He also said that Mr. Ye's designation of running libraries and rural education is particularly urgent to save the country. Then Mr. Ye proposed that Qian Xinzhi, Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Huang Renzhi, and Gao Yanyun be elected as executive directors, and Qian Xinzhi be the convener, which was passed. Mr. Ye designated Zhu Kongjia, Zhu Yinjiang, and Wang Baolun as fund custodians, who were convened by Mr. Ye. He also proposed that Mr. Cai Zimin be the chairman of the board of directors, and Mr. Shen Xinqing and Mu Ouchu be the vice chairmen. Shen Xinqing, Xu Qiufan, and Wei Wenhan were the drafters of various documents and rules, and Jiang Wenyu was the recording director, which was passed. It was also agreed that the association would discuss with the Shanghai Humanities Library Preparatory Office to merge the two. The Humanities Library will incorporate all the books into the Hongying Library, which the association plans to write, and the two parties will make an agreement to exchange them, which was all passed. During the meeting, Mr. Ye's sons and grandsons stood up and expressed their respect and obedience to their grandfather's good intentions. Mr. Ye can be said to be good at using money. His hard work throughout his life has yielded such a great blessing. His spirit and his career are enough to make him immortal for thousands of years. The documents learned by the New Sound Society are as follows: Preface and rules, full text of the preface and rules of the Hongying Education Fund: (A) Preface: Hongying is from Fujian, born in Shanghai, studied commerce in his youth, and sailed the sea in his twenties. He traded for many years, all for others. He was eager to learn and tireless, and gradually knew the way to do business. He worked diligently, cautiously and frugally, and after more than ten years, he finally gained a little savings, which he used to open Yuanchang Company in Shanghai, and then set up branches in Japan and Korea. Although the economy has improved compared to the past, the hard work has doubled. Be cautious and moderate, and advance step by step. After several decades, it has reached today. Looking back on the past, everything has been accumulated from diligence and frugality. Hongying has three sons and five daughters. Except for the eldest son who died early, the rest and the eldest grandson are healthy and have received considerable education. They are quite self-reliant and can be comforting. In order to promote their progress, he has given considerable gifts to his children and grandchildren. If they can use it and develop it, it will not be difficult to have enough food and clothing. Inner worries are relieved. Those who have received the lead are also beyond the special share that should be inherited. Hongying's responsibility to support his children and grandchildren has also been fulfilled. There is no worry internally or externally. Hongying is over seventy years old and is approaching his old age. What should be avoided is especially what he has gained. He plans to use his pension and the property he owns under his name, except for other regulations, to fully provide for social undertakings in the hope of slightly supplementing the country and society to express his wishes. He believes that the frequent internal troubles and the increasing external aggression are all signs of corruption. If he intends to be diligent and strong, and benefit the people, he cannot ignore the strategy of cultivating the roots and cleaning the source. The people are the foundation of the country, and the foundation is strong and the country is safe. Therefore, educating the people is the essential element of consolidating the foundation. The Chinese people account for 80% of the farmers. Rural national education cannot be delayed. Shanghai is China,</p>
<p>The largest commercial port, Xiang Xian's complete library. In the past, the Oriental Library of the Commercial Press had the largest collection of books, but when Japan invaded Shanghai, it was burned to the ground, which is really sad. Therefore, it is also planned to build a library to preserve the essence of China and to combine Eastern and Western cultures. After visiting the Humanities Library Preparatory Office, I learned that it has been collecting for many years and has a rich collection, but due to its location and economic limitations, it has not been able to open for public reading. And its plan is that if there is a fund that can independently donate construction costs and operating expenses, the name of the donor will be used as a permanent memorial. It really won my heart, and the two sides are old friends, and they can cooperate. So the idea of donating to run a library was decided. Hongying plans to run many businesses, but limited by its resources, it only intends to run the above two businesses. The donated assets and rules are listed below for reference. It is not to compare with the sages, but to fulfill the responsibilities of a citizen. (B) Rules, Chapter 1, Property: According to the following regulations, all donated properties will be transferred to the Hongying Education Fund account. Article 1, Real Estate: All real estate and its accessories in this article are owned by this corporate legal person. However, the real estate shall not be sold, mortgaged, or otherwise impaired its value in order to ensure the permanent existence of the planned business. (Details of real estate omitted) Article 2, Stocks: All securities in this article are also owned by this corporate legal person, and may be disposed of at an appropriate time with the unanimous consent of the following directors. (Details of stocks omitted) Article 3, Cash: All cash in this article is also owned by this corporate legal person. (Details omitted)</p>

He cited the completed alumni association building at the Tangshan campus, the newly purchased land for building a sports field, the student dormitories at the Pingxiang campus, and the Shanghai campus reconstruction plan displayed in the gymnasium as evidence. He then explained the significance of the Industrial and Iron Exhibition, addressing criticisms from outside, such as the promotion of foreign goods and unrestricted visitor access, with thorough explanations. He also clarified the origin of the name Kehong Hall and detailed the history of Rong Hong (Yung Wing), proving that Rong Hong's ideas were the original driving force behind China's reform and that his advocacy for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Kaiping Mines had direct connections to the school. Finally, he emphasized the school's significant mission and hoped the alumni would provide spiritual and material assistance at all times. Dr. John Calvin Ferguson sent a paper on new Chinese education, which Li Zhaohuan read aloud. Subsequently, Xu Jinsheng, Mao Tangchen, and Zhang Gangbo gave speeches, expressing unlimited hope for the future of their alma mater.

<h3>Amateur Group A Billiards Tournament Opens, Shen Lince Triumphs</h3>
<p>Opponent Clark Concedes Defeat</p>
<p>Bernal vs. Robertson Today</p>
<p>| Original Schedule Altered |</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Group A billiards tournament began yesterday. According to the original schedule, Walter was to play Mitchell, but neither arrived on time. Shen Lince and Clark were present, so the schedule was changed temporarily, moving the original match to the 12th of this month. The match between Shen Lince and Clark was held yesterday during the opening ceremony. Shen Lince's skill was superior to Clark's, but Clark's defense was adequate, so the difference in the first half was not significant. When Shen reached 500 points, Clark had 419 points. In the second half, Clark conceded defeat. As a result, Shen triumphed without much effort. Today at 5:30 PM, the second match of the preliminary round will be between British veteran Bernal and Robertson, a skilled player from the British army. Bernal's talent is unparalleled in Shanghai, and Robertson, although skilled, may find it difficult to withstand an opponent with over thirty years of experience.</p>
<h3>Central China Football League</h3>
<p>To Be Held in Hankou on April 7</p>
<p>(Wuhu Correspondent) The annual Central China Football Competition, originally organized and hosted in rotation by the education departments of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces, was supposed to be hosted by the Hubei Education Department last year, but the preparations were suspended due to disagreements between the Hubei Education Department and the Hankou government. The event was postponed to this year, with the Hubei Education Department still responsible for preparations. The Anhui Education Department recently received a telegram from the Hubei Provincial Government stating that this year's Central China Football Competition, postponed from last year, will still be organized and convened by Hubei Province. Preparations are now complete, and the competition is scheduled to be held in Hankou on April 7. The Hubei government hopes that Anhui Province will send a team to Hankou to participate. Upon receiving the telegram, the Anhui Education Department, due to the short notice, is actively preparing for preliminary matches in the province and has telegraphed various secondary schools in the city, requesting them to send strong teams to participate in the preliminary matches in the province, before taking a steamer to Hankou to participate.

<h3>Thoughts on Children's Day Kong Xiangxi</h3>
<p>Xiangxi has just returned from abroad and before my traveling clothes are off, there is a trip to the northern front to comfort the soldiers. On the road, the beloved Children's Day has suddenly arrived. At this time, with strong neighbors pressing our borders and war clouds gathering, people in our country must say that we should urgently attend to the greater and more distant matters and neglect the holding of this festival. Xiangxi has something to say about this. After the Franco-Prussian War, when the German army triumphed, Bismarck said to his subordinates, "Our success today is due to the elementary school teachers over the years." This is because the brave and victorious soldiers all came from their early days of shaping. The Germans were once oppressed by the iron heel of Napoleon III, just as we are oppressed by the violent Japanese today. Now, our entire country is striving to resist, but the outcome is still uncertain. If we are fortunate enough to win, we will hope that those who come after us will promote and glorify it. If we unfortunately lose, we must hope for the other day to wash away the shame and hatred. Therefore, the relationship between today's children and our country is not trivial. Xiangxi has traveled to various countries this time, during a time of global economic crisis. European and American powers are all in danger, industry and commerce are declining everywhere. Even though there are usually differences of opinion among the parties, when encountering difficulties, they all sacrifice unity and support the crisis together. This is due to the ability of their political parties to maintain the overall situation, but also relies on the consistent promotion of their citizens. The main reason lies in the popularity of children's education, so the people have a very true understanding of the concept of the country and their own responsibilities. At this time of national crisis, we should uphold the righteousness of survival and rise up to resist, but the fundamental plan is to educate children to plan for a hundred years of education, which is the most important thing and should not be neglected. The establishment of Children's Day was originally presented by the association and promulgated by the National Government. The meaning and methods of its holding are described in detail in the handbook published by the association this year and need not be repeated. I am now expressing my views and hope to draw the attention of the people of the country so that the cause of child care in our country will improve day by day, and the prosperity of the country will rely on it.</p>
<p>Youth is lovely, full of vitality, the development of children is the beginning of life, maintenance, teaching, and cultivation in a timely manner, the nation will prosper, and the foundation will be planted. Strive hard, comrades, to preside over it.</p>

<h3>Children's Sports and the Future of the Nation</h3>
<p>| Congratulatory Message for Children's Memorial Day |</p>
<p>Mayor of Shanghai Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>In ancient China, governance combined education and upbringing: raising the young and caring for the old was always emphasized. This is because children have keen intelligence, pure conscience, and lively nature: their wisdom, virtue, and physical strength are all above those of adults. If they can be taught and raised, each in the right way, they will easily become talents for society and improve the quality of the nation.</p>
<p>The modern trend of political reform in various countries pays great attention to the protection of people's lives: and children's lives and children's rights are guaranteed by the constitution. The new German constitution after the war is a clear example. Article 122 of the German constitution stipulates: "Children shall be protected from overwork and moral, spiritual, and physical neglect. The federal government, states, and public organizations shall take the necessary measures to this end." Secondly, Articles 119 and 120 also contain provisions on family health and compulsory education. As for the labor codes of various countries, the protection of children is even more comprehensive, such as the items of working age, working hours, education level, and physical health, all of which are subject to strict and special restrictions and care in the law. Our country's philosophers never ignored the issue of children, as it is said, "Men have their duties, women have their homes, the strong are employed, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled are all cared for" and "Care for your own elders, and extend that care to the elders of others; love your own young, and extend that love to the young of others." Their love for children and attention to the spirit of children can be imagined. Unfortunately, in recent times, education has declined, and not only the state and society ignore children; even parents and teachers are unaware of their responsibility to educate and raise them. Living together in crowds, they do not speak of righteousness; their behavior is dissolute, and their minds and bodies deteriorate day by day. Children are the future spirit of the nation and the cornerstone of the country. If this continues without attention, the suffering that the nation and country will suffer is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Today is the day of the Children's Day commemoration, and I have been asked to contribute, so I am taking the opportunity to express my feelings during my free time. I deeply hope that those engaged in the children's movement today will pay close attention to and study children's psychology, children's education, children's thoughts, children's habits, children's morals, children's bodies, children's lives, children's hygiene, and children's welfare, so that countless lively, pure, and intelligent children will not be corrupted by bad environments, and will become talents for the state and society. Then, the benefit to the future of the nation is immeasurable! Children's Day, Year 22.</p>
<h3>Today's Chinese Children Pan Gongzhan</h3>
<p>Under distorted over- or under-treatment, our Chinese children have always been regarded as precious playthings or superfluous burdens and cannot obtain the necessary natural development. In all aspects of life, all evils—weakness, cowardice, stupidity, selfishness—are sown at this time because the love of parents in "unscientific methods" has results that are contrary to expectations. Going down, we often see many children in society shriveling in a state of "premature aging" and losing their youthfulness, which is truly a strange thing to behold.</p>
<p>The love of parents for their children is an inevitable ethics. But the question is not "whether to love" but "whether to love correctly." Otherwise, because love is not appropriate, it often creates evil results. So-called "love" ends up becoming "harm": harming children and harming the entire nation.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the warriors our nation needs in the present and future are strong, brave, rational, and self-sacrificing youths who serve the public. Therefore, in the education of children, we must use "scientific training methods" to overcome the "unscientific methods of love" of the past. We must maintain the children's lively and pure spirit, and we must temper the children's strength and courage.</p>
<p>All pampering of children is poison that harms children and harms the nation. Parents must have a full understanding.</p>
<h3>Talking About Children's Day Li Ting'an</h3>
<p>Infant Hygiene and Preschool Children's Hygiene Today is the second Chinese Children's Day. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about infant hygiene and preschool children's hygiene. We believe that the health of a nation's people is greatly related to their childhood. Children are still in the stage of development. If we do not use various methods that conform to hygienic principles to train and maintain them, they are prone to early death, or even if they escape early death, they are prone to becoming cowardly and weak people. Not only will they be unable to serve the country and society, but the country and society will have to spend a certain amount of relief funds. Therefore, to seek the health of a nation's people, we must focus on children's hygiene.</p>
<h3>Seeking Happiness for Children is the Inherent Duty of Adults by Pan Pan Zhan</h3>
<p>, and special attention must be paid to its implementation.</p>
<p>Children can be divided into three stages: from birth to one year old, called infants; from two years old to the age of compulsory education (six full years), called pre-school children; and from the age of compulsory education onwards, called school-age children. The health of school-age children falls within the scope of school health, and health authorities and schools should jointly bear the responsibility for implementation and guidance. As for the health of infants and pre-school children, it mainly lies with the family, and the mother bears the primary responsibility. Today is Children's Day, so I will specifically discuss infant health and pre-school child health to draw the attention of parents.</p>
<p>1. Infants: Infants are particularly susceptible to death within the first four weeks after birth. After two months, their chances of survival are better. Infants born to mothers with illnesses are prone to death or will not be healthy. Therefore, maintaining the mother's health is the only essential way to preserve the infant's health. If the mother has syphilis, alcoholism, chronic tuberculosis, anemia, or other diseases, the infant is likely to be born prematurely or even die. Infants depend on milk for life, so special attention should be paid to breastfeeding and milk quality, following these points:</p>
<p>(1) Breastfeeding should start within twelve hours after birth, and then every three or four hours (breastfeeding can be stopped from 10 PM to 6 AM the next morning).</p>
<p>(2) Before breastfeeding, the nipple should be cleaned with a 10% boric acid solution or boiled water. After breastfeeding, the nipple should be washed in the same way. Any remaining milk should be squeezed out immediately, otherwise the milk supply will decrease.</p>
<p>(3) Infants should not suckle too quickly, to avoid choking. If choking occurs, the infant should be held up, with the abdomen resting against the mother's body, and the back gently patted. After the air in the stomach is expelled and the choking stops, then feed again.</p>
<p>(4) An infant's crying is not always for milk. Check clothing for tightness, whether there are mosquito bites or lice, and whether the infant is too cold or too hot.</p>
<p>(5) Breast milk from the infant's own mother is the most suitable. Unless there is a compelling reason (such as the mother suffering from tuberculosis, an acute infectious disease, breast disease, pregnancy, or epilepsy), the infant should not suckle milk from another woman or be fed cow's milk or milk powder substitutes.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned health aspects related to infant feeding, there are other points to note:</p>
<p>(1) Infants under one month old should sleep up to twenty hours a day. From one month to one year old, they should sleep sixteen hours a day.</p>
<p>(2) Infants can be taken outside after one week of age to enjoy fresh air, but be careful to protect them from sudden exposure to extreme heat or cold.</p>
<p>(3) Infants should be bathed regularly, but be careful to avoid chilling.</p>
<p>(4) Infant clothing must be soft and dry. Bedding and mattresses should be changed immediately if they become damp.</p>
<p>(5) After one month, consult a doctor about vaccinating against smallpox. If smallpox is prevalent, vaccination can be discussed with a doctor as early as two weeks after birth.</p>
<p>(6) Infants' organs are still fragile. Excessive laughter, anger, shouting, or other extreme sounds, as well as terrifying sights, can stimulate their brains, so a quiet environment should be maintained.</p>
<p>(7) The infant's mouth should be cleaned daily with a 10% boric acid solution. When the milk teeth appear, cleaning should be done every morning and night.</p>
<p>(8) Infants often die from bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, enteritis, convulsions, whooping cough, and other diseases. However, these are not easily detected by non-doctors, so doctors should regularly perform health checks on infants. If an infant shows any adverse symptoms (such as excessive crying or decreased appetite), a pediatrician should be consulted promptly for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>2. Pre-School Children: For children aged one year and above until the age of compulsory national education, survival is slightly easier than for infants under one year old. However, due to malnutrition, congenital weaknesses, and susceptibility to illness, they are still prone to death. Therefore, parents must continue to provide careful care and appropriate education. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Children under three years old should sleep fourteen hours a day. Children under six years old should sleep ten hours a day.</p>
<p>(2) Guide them in suitable light exercise, ensure they breathe fresh air, and expose them to sunlight, but still be careful to protect them from sudden exposure to extreme heat or cold.</p>
<p>(3) Clothing and bedding should not be damp, and they should be bathed regularly. Their mouths should also be kept clean.</p>
<p>(4) To prevent smallpox, have them vaccinated every three years.</p>
<p>(5) To prevent rickets, young children should be exposed to direct sunlight regularly and, if possible, fed appropriate amounts of foods containing Vitamin D (such as cod liver oil) and iron (such as egg yolks).</p>
<p>(6) To prevent scurvy, if possible, feed them appropriate amounts of foods containing Vitamin C, such as orange juice, tomato juice, and vegetables.</p>
<p>(7) To prevent other diseases such as diphtheria, cholera, scarlet fever, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, influenza, and dysentery, consult qualified doctors for appropriate prevention and guidance.</p>
<p>(8) Have doctors perform health checks and treat any abnormalities immediately.</p>
<p>(9) Cultivate good hygiene habits, such as: (1) liking cleanliness, (2) eating at regular times, (3) avoiding miscellaneous foods, (4) having a bowel movement every morning, (5) washing hands before meals, (6) rejecting bad habits such as smoking, alcohol, and other stimulants, (7) having a fair and peaceful attitude.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief outline of infant and pre-school child health. Parents should understand and implement it.</p>

<h3>Scholars Without Scholarship</h3>
<p>— He Jia Gan</p>
<p>1. In the supplement of a newspaper with the surname "Da," someone with the surname "Yi" "urges Chinese youth to avoid reprehensible vices under the guise of 'scholars being unprincipled.'" This is absolutely correct. However, the definition of "unprincipled" is extremely strict. It is said: "The so-called unprincipled does not necessarily refer to irregular or immoral behavior; it includes all inhuman and deplorable actions."</p>
<p>Then, some examples of Japanese scholars' "vices" are cited as warnings for Chinese youth. One is "Koji Karoku likes to scratch his hair with his fingernails," and another is "Kaneko Yobun likes to lick his lips."</p>
<p>Naturally, dry lips and an itchy scalp have never been praised as virtues by sages throughout history, but they don't seem to have been condemned as vices either. Unexpectedly, in present-day Shanghai, scratching and licking, even one's own lips and hair, have become "inhuman and deplorable actions." If one is uncomfortable, one must endure it. Being a promising youth or scholar is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>However, the "vices" of Chinese scholars are not really these. As long as they can write articles, scratching or licking is irrelevant. What is "inhuman" is not "scholars being unprincipled," but "scholars without scholarship."</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, we saw publications saying that a certain poet had gone to West Lake to compose poetry, and a certain literary giant was writing a novel of 500,000 words, but until now, apart from the unannounced "Midnight," no other major works have appeared.</p>
<p>Some collect trivial matters to write essays; some revise ancient prose and pass it off as their own. Some give senseless talks and call them critiques; some compile journals and secretly praise themselves. Some gather vulgar anecdotes and write inferior works; some collect old articles and print them as critical biographies. Some even translate foreign literary news and become literary historians; some compile dictionaries of literary figures, including themselves, and become world-renowned scholars. Nevertheless, these are all "scholars" with golden reputations in China.</p>
<p>Scholars are inevitably without scholarship, and warriors are similarly unwarlike. Some say they are "ready for battle with their spears as pillows," but they haven't moved by nightfall; some say they will "resist to the death," but they flee at the sight of a hundred enemy soldiers. Only proclamations and declarations are grandly written in parallel prose, unusually "scholarly." "Cease warfare and cultivate culture" is an ancient maxim, and the star of culture shines entirely on the barracks. Therefore, our "scholars" only refrain from licking their lips and scratching their hair, figure out human relations, and merely achieve being "principled."</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teacher (Continued)</h3>
<p>— by H. Barbusse, translated by Li Qingya</p>
<p>Since that victory, the Spanish priests have exerted unprecedentedly cruel oppression on elementary schools, relying on the royal family that has been laughed at throughout history, and later relying on the power of the dictator. During the era of the dictator, the military officers were kings and the rulers were priests, resulting in a nostalgic country where the priests were rolling backward to the times of punishing heretics from all directions. Those great speakers in the country, wanting to make the people believe that they would gradually gain freedom and happiness from the occasionally effective laws of evolution, found it difficult to speak.</p>
<p>Therefore, the headmaster and his shadow-like deputy hated this sincere and independent elementary school teacher. The more empathetic he was, the more dangerous they considered him. However, because they could not find any destructive elements in his actions and discussions, they had to find other ways to catch his mistakes.</p>
<p>In today's unfortunate Spain, the government allows priests to walk around in schools, the purpose of which is to monitor what education is being provided by the schools.</p>
<p>On this day I am talking about, the door of the village elementary school classroom suddenly opened during class, and the two people in black robes entered the not-so-bright classroom from the square of light that shone in from the door. Then they squatted down and listened quietly.</p>
<p>Zoli calmly continued the lesson he was teaching. He questioned Xiao Qunido, who, because he didn't understand, was a little embarrassed and stammered:</p>
<p>"Justice... equality..."</p>
<p>The headmaster took two steps forward and stood in front of the child.</p>
<p>"What is this?" he asked angrily. Qunido was flustered and opened his mouth without answering. In his class was a fourteen-year-old student named Luyinzi, who had always been the best student. This time he wanted to show that he had already understood and remembered what the teacher had said, so he stood up and answered:</p>
<p>"Headmaster, sir, all people in the world are equal."</p>
<p>"This sentence is wrong!" the person in the black robe shouted, and at the same time ran over, raising his fist and extending it under the good student's nose. "This sentence is wrong! This is contrary to religious education. God never said that all people in the world are equal, and Saint Paul said in his name that they are not equal!"</p>
<p>He shouted loudly, the blue veins on his forehead swelled, and white foam formed many small balls at the corners of his mouth. At this time, the deputy headmaster showed satisfaction with gestures, raising his arms to the sky.</p>
<p>The elementary school teacher calmly stepped forward.</p>
<p>"Please allow me, Headmaster," he said. "What should I allow you?" the headmaster roared. "Want me to allow you to tell lies? Allow you to teach children to tell lies? To advocate that all people in the world are equal is to promote a lie forbidden by God. Do you understand? Children, listen to me: your teacher is lying to you!" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>On "New Eight-Legged Essays"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xiuxia</p>
<p>In China, many things often love to follow the "fashion." Originally, "fashion" is not a bad thing, but "fashion" that changes the broth without changing the medicine is almost the same as "stale." If the skin and flesh of your face remain the same, even if you wash off the makeup of a "painted face" and change it to a "green robe," your original appearance is still the same. Therefore, "fashion" is not changing the name. Calling "钞票" (鈔票 banknote) Money, or calling "賤內" (賤內 my humble wife) Wife, does not count as being Upto date. For example, love between men and women was called "通姦" (通姦 adultery) in ancient times, but now it is called "軋姘頭" (軋姘頭 having an affair). In the mouths of general modern young ladies and young masters, it is called "戀愛" (戀愛 love). Another example is an emperor wearing a crown, when he is the only one to be respected, it is called the "專制時代" (專制時代 autocratic era), but now the actions of several important figures in leather belts, it is called "民主政治" (民主政治 democratic politics). The words are indeed different, but if the "broth" has been changed, but not the "medicine," if you think about it carefully, is it not the same thing!</p>
<p>Speaking of the literary world, "new scholars" naturally want to follow the "fashion." Although he does not necessarily understand music, in his article he often says how he is touched by the "梵啞鈴" (梵啞鈴 violin)! (I don't believe that the huqin and erhu cannot be moving!) Although he can write entirely in Chinese characters in his articles, he always likes to insert a few sentences of foreign language. However, in fact, ever since Old Dr. Hu Shi advocated the New Culture Movement and opposed the use of allusions and clichés (the Eight No's), although those old eight-legged essays have been "reformed," how about the new "natural feet"? It's terrible! The "natural feet" are still bound by another kind of foot-binding cloth. If you don't believe me, let's look at the contrast between the old and new eight-legged essays:</p>
<p>(Old) A certain student, suave and talented, meets a certain young lady in the garden, and through gifts of money, becomes the top scholar and achieves a grand reunion.</p>
<p>(New) A certain student, with sexual frustration and no way out, strolls arm-in-arm with a certain modern woman in the garden, then shares a small room, cohabits, divorces, and ends up drifting.</p>
<p>(Old) Moreover, between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>(New) Ah! This empty universe.</p>
<p>(Old) Alas, my love!</p>
<p>(New) Oh, my beloved!</p>
<p>(Old) Confucius said... Mencius said... Does the Book of Poetry not say...? Truly, these words are true.</p>
<p>(New) Kant said... Plekhanov said... Doesn't it say in the Three Principles of the People...? This is very correct.</p>
<p>This comparison is not intentionally created, but really picked up at random. Is this not the appearance of a new eight-legged essay that "reforms the face" but does not "cleanse the heart"? I have also taught for two years, and what I hate the most is when students force me to give them essay topics, because what they produce are all clichés and old sayings, moaning without illness, even more difficult than "eating stinky duck eggs." It's pitiful that general middle school teachers always like to tell fifteen- or sixteen-year-old children to write things like "The Falling Leaves in Late Autumn" or "The Sorrow of a Moonlit Night," and specify that they must be short essays.</p>
<p>Long creative writing</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of Time and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>He didn't know where to go.</p>
<p>Later, he found a room in a cheap hotel.</p>
<p>When he woke up the next morning, he was still thinking of Mrs. Hezi and had no intention of going to school. He thought that apologizing to her father was also an option, as long as he could return to her. Several times he thought about going back to her house. But when he thought that her father still lived in her house, his footsteps became difficult again.</p>
<p>"How happy it would be to be sleeping in bed while Mrs. Hezi sat on the edge of the bed chatting and laughing with me! Living in her house not only had all sorts of mental comfort, but also all the daily life was very comfortable. Since yesterday, I have felt a lot of physical pain."</p>
<p>Coming out of the hotel, he thought that only Old Cao was someone he could be casual with. He should go to his house first and discuss it further. He regretted that he shouldn't have impulsively hit that Japanese guy. Otherwise, he would still be living in Mrs. Hezi's house at this moment, either sleeping soundly under the covers, or sitting at his desk writing. Wasn't Mr. Li Yixiang promising to find a way to publish his works?</p>
<p>As he thought and walked, he unconsciously came to the front of the Great World entertainment complex. He looked up at the large clock on the Red Tin Package cigarette advertisement tower. It was twelve minutes past ten. At that time, he saw a shiny, well-maintained car coming from the direction of Eight Immortals Bridge. When he saw the person sitting in the car, his chest suddenly palpitated again.</p>
<p>"Isn't that Zhuo Shuhua? Why is her hair so disheveled and her face so pale? She looks like she just got up and hasn't washed yet?" So he thought of her home situation and imagined her mysterious life. In his heart, there was another layer of annoyance.</p>
<p>"Miss Zhuo!"</p>
<p>He couldn't help but call out. But the car sped past quickly. He thought that she must have seen him, which is why she turned her face away, pretending not to see him. How could there be such an inhumane person in the world?</p>
<p>"Forget it. She's not your anything. Why bother yourself!"</p>
<p>Although he thought so, he couldn't dispel his concern for her. Imagining her degenerate life, it seemed that his responsibility for her had become even heavier. At this time, his heart was really like a hypocritical missionary in the church, harboring a kind of subjectivity and prejudice, thinking that he was the only one who could enter heaven, while the seekers kneeling in front of him were all guilty, only eagerly waiting for his influence and salvation.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he was a little ashamed. He thought that he was really overestimating himself.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Cao Shiguang's house, he only saw Shiguang holding a child, sitting on a low bamboo chair, looking unhappy.</p>
<p>"Ah, you've come. Please sit down."</p>
<p>There was not the slightest smile on Shiguang's face. Looking at his expression, he was very annoyed, unlike when he usually saw Haiquan, when his face was full of smiles.</p>
<p>is to express feelings. (Probably especially valuing sadness)! You think, such a child, apart from wanting to see movies and play ball, what kind of mood is there to write. As a result, the opening is again "Ah! This empty universe..." There are some literati who specialize in copying books. As soon as they start, they quote someone or something, and in parentheses, they quote a large passage, so so-and-so said this, so-and-so said that, and his own article is done. Moreover, it is obviously long and can show off erudition. In fact, these "quasi-reprint" type articles, these "patchwork" type articles, are just some "fine sayings excerpts."</p>
<p>These kinds of "new eight-legged essays" must also be overthrown.</p>
<h3>Qu Lu Musings</h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>12. My Ah Q Philosophy</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Mr. Yi Baisha taught us the Six Writings, and on the character "黨" (黨 party) he said: "黨 (dǎng), is not fresh; from 尚 (shàng), from 黑 (hēi), 尚 (shàng) is the phonetic component. If the party emphasizes secrecy, then it is not fresh; if the party has much darkness, then it is not clean." At that time, the Yuan Shikai party was in power, attacking the people's party, and the two sides were in stalemate, causing turmoil throughout the country. Mr. Yi was lamenting the times and feeling the events, his words were purposeful, and he couldn't help but sigh. Those who heard it were moved. I was still young at the time, and was proud of my ability to write, and was greatly envied by my classmates. Among my classmates were so-called "Jinggang Lao" people, who moved in groups and stopped in parties, and envied me even more, making trouble for me in every way. Sarcasm and insults were endless. They gave me ugly nicknames, such as Chen dead man, old eight-legged essay, fortune teller, and so on, more than a dozen of them. Even now, when old friends meet, they still use them as jokes. At that time, I was also sharp and aloof, and became even more conceited. When I heard Mr. Yi's words, I remembered Confucius's words, so I took "不黨" (bù dǎng non-partisan) as my studio name, placed myself as a gentleman, and treated others as petty people. When adversity came, I would simply bow. I accepted insults without disgrace, and did not argue when offended, as if there was a separate victory to be had. This is the victory of the Ah Q type. In the spring of 1927, I was a Chinese teacher at a girls' normal school. One day, I was teaching a new selection of Tang poems, up to Hanshanzi's poems:</p>
<p>Pigs eat dead people's meat, people eat dead pig intestines. Pigs don't dislike human stench, people instead say pigs smell fragrant. Pigs die and are thrown into the water, people die and are buried in the earth. Let's not devour each other, may lotuses grow in the boiling soup.</p>
<p>I see hundreds of dogs, each with shaggy fur; those who lie down lie down, those who walk walk; throw them a piece of bone, they snarl and fight with each other; truly because the bone is scarce, and the dogs are unevenly divided.</p>
<p>After a female student finished reading, she stood up and said, "Teacher, these two poems are extremely wonderful. Are they not symbolizing that different parties fight each other, and even the same party fights each other?" I was shocked and changed my expression, and remained silent for a long time. When I later settled in Shanghai, I printed these two poems on the back of my business card, but distributed very few, and those who obtained them treasured them. I also named my studio Pig or Dog. Living along the coast, I had the intention of escaping from the world without sorrow. Later, I deeply understood Laozi's theory of the black female, and changed my studio name to "不爭" (bù zhēng non-contention), claiming that no one in the world could contend with me, and was content with myself, almost to the end of my life. This is also the philosophy of Ah Q.</p>
<p>Mr. Qu Lu said: In my life, there have been many strict teachers and respected friends. Mr. Yi and a certain female student were the ones who gave me important revelations about how to be a person. For twenty years, I have been a useless thing to society, the kind of person that Zhuangzi called those who considered life as an appendage and superfluous tumor. Mr. Yi has already jumped into the sea to end his life, and I don't know where that female student has disappeared to. The changes in the world are becoming more urgent, and the people's livelihood is becoming more difficult. The Lu disaster has not ended, and Lu has no Jiu (rescuer), alas!</p>

<h3>British and American Exchange Rates Gradually Tightening</h3>
<p>Bank Sector Supporting Far-Term, Selling Near-Term</p>
<p>Central Bank Inclined to Sell August</p>

Initially, it was average. The May US dollar at 29.3125 yuan was desired by all banks. When Huabi released the May 3.125, it seemed to be loosening. However, Huabi and others still supported the far-term, gradually leveling off. Pangen and Huabi both took the July 0.875, anticipating that the listed prices for shillings and US dollars would not change, which seemed better, as the market on last Saturday was softened excessively. Huabi supported the July US dollar at 29.8125 and sold the July 0.75. Subsequently, it became more peaceful. Although the trend was good, banks were still entering and exiting, so it was inevitable to fluctuate. At the best time, Maijiali had taken the July US dollar at 6.875. Although foreign dispatches seemed unfavorable, except for Citibank releasing the June US dollar at 4.375, the noon closing was still average. Recent prices quoted the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 8 pence 0.3125, and the US exchange rate at 29 yuan. The afternoon market was initially quiet. The central bank sold from time to time. Far-term US dollars suddenly became surprisingly tight after entry. Maijiali and Huabi both took the July US dollar at 29.5625.

<p>The interest rate for silver dollars in March was only a few cents per day. It never reached one jiao or one qian throughout the month, so the total amount was always less than the fixed amount of two yuan or two taels.

<h3>Statistics on Global Gold Production</h3>
<p>New York, April 1st: Report from the US Bureau of Metal Statistics:</p>
<p>January February</p>
<p>Global Production 1,994,000 1,837,000 ounces</p>
<p>Of which, US 210,000 147,000</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York Stocks Inconsistent</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: Last Saturday (April 1st), the New York stock market gradually stabilized due to short covering and strong steel stocks. The latter was because Carnegie Steel Company, an affiliate of US Steel Corporation, would increase its workload from 13% to 24%. New Jersey Telephone Company, an affiliate of US Telephone and Telegraph Company, reduced its dividend from 7 yuan to 6 yuan, but was supported by others, so it did not fall. In addition, railway freight increased by 26,138 vehicles in the week ending March 25th. Half-day transactions totaled 450,000 shares. Overall, the current stock market situation is unlikely to recover in the shortest time, so it seems unlikely to rebound strongly. However, high-quality securities can still be supported even in a recession, and the future prospects of several speculative stocks are also quite promising once business gradually recovers in the future. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 55.68 Up 0.28</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 25.06 Down 0.48</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 19.38 Up 0.05</p>
<p>40 Bonds 74.36 Down 0.05</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Before the Wage Cut Issue is Resolved</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Awaits and Sees</p>
<p>Actual Demand is Best on the Yangtze River Route</p>
<p>The yarn market will be closed on April 5th and 6th for the Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>The yarn market rose and then fell, but the trend was relatively calm. Because the issue of wage cuts in yarn factories has not been resolved, people are generally suspicious, and the scope of operations is shrinking. A decision must be made after the factory's general meeting on April 10th. However, actual demand is very active, and the Yangtze River route buys the most. However, some see the global cotton industry in a state of sadness, and new long positions are not very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Human Mark Is Calm</h3>
<p>The human mark market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was more prosperous. There were more buyers in the market, and Changfeng bought more to go long, with huge package sizes. Each month rose 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 qian. Although current yarn transactions were smooth in the afternoon, the human atmosphere was average, and each month fell 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,000 bales. The sales were Yongzai 700 bales, Taixing 350 bales, Tongfu 350 bales, Changji 400 bales, and Yiyu 450 bales.

<h3>Marked Cotton Gradually Shows Signs of Fatigue</h3>
<p>The cotton market is advancing towards a soft path. As Indian cotton sees new lows, people's hearts are discouraged, and various foreign firms are selling fiercely in the market. However, factories see the environment as bad and are cautious in handling raw materials, so current cotton business remains sluggish. However, some long positions still absorb the amount and do not let go. The global cotton market is declining, and it is feared that the future market will be difficult to establish.</p>
<h3>Zheng Mark Falls</h3>
<p>The Zheng Mark opened in the morning. Although Indian cotton fell sharply, American cotton rose, and people's hearts were average. Each month fell slightly from 0.05 to 0.015 yuan. The afternoon opening was still volatile, because many desired to close out positions, but did not let go. The second and third positions were slightly fatigued, falling from 0.05 to 0.01 yuan.

<p>Zheng Mark Closing Price Rise and Fall on Account Balance for July 3130 Fall 151,060 April 3085 Fall 20,965,000 August 3145 15,902,200 May 3095 15,924,400 Total 458,100 June 3115 20,100,000</p>

Others entered 500 bales, priced at 22.8 taels, a decrease of 0.2 qian compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Bombay Cotton Trade Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Last week, the cotton market saw significant activity, but the trend was weak due to profit-taking by bulls. Subsequently, cross-market buying occurred due to a wider price difference between Indian and American cotton, preventing further declines. Export inquiries were slightly better, with Japan making large purchases of Dholera cotton. Europe and China also saw considerable transactions. Local yarn mills, due to sluggish yarn sales, showed no interest in importing Indian cotton despite its lower price compared to American cotton. The weekly statistics for the past week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>

Yesterday, brokers began to offer prices, with miscellaneous brands increasing by approximately two coins compared to the previous price. The genuine new Rui Long brand was not offered because the owner insisted on 20 taels, which was about 1.5 taels higher than the current market price.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Children's Day Special Issue</p>
<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Childhood is the era of emerging brilliance. Looking at descriptions of the morning sun, we always say that the rising sun has bright pupils. I hope that all children in the country, like the bright pupils of the rising sun, will gradually reveal their brilliance. Because the character "瞳" (pupil) contains the character "童" (child).</p>
<p>Childhood is the era when reputation begins. Looking at the Chinese musical score, the first sound is the bell, and the last sound is the chime, which is called "golden sound and jade vibration." I hope that all children in the country, like the sound of the bell that first plays music, will gradually "spread their reputation throughout China." Because the character "鐘" (bell) contains the character "童" (child).</p>
<p>Childhood is the era when external impressions are most easily imprinted. Looking at people's bodies, the easiest place for external impressions to be imprinted is on the pupils. If a sage comes, the pupil will imprint a sage; if a demon comes, the pupil will imprint a demon. I hope that all children in the country will constantly imprint the model figures of ancient and modern times in their pupils and never get close to demons. Because the character "瞳" (pupil) contains the character "童" (child).</p>
<p>Childhood is the era when dangers most easily arise from deviating from norms. Looking at land travel, there are land travel norms. If you do not follow the train timetable, a collision between two trains can easily lead to a derailment. Water travel has water travel norms. If you do not follow the compass-indicated route, a collision between a ship and a reef can easily lead to a shipwreck. I hope that all children in the country will value their daily cultivation efforts as much as they value the train timetable. The good path pointed out to you by your parents, brothers, teachers, and friends should be regarded as the same as the nautical route indicated by the compass. Then, in your childhood process, you can avoid the most easily occurring danger of collision. Because the character "撞" (collide) contains the character "童" (child).</p>
<h3>The Little Hero in the Hailstorm</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Southern Africa is often a place where big hailstorms occur. Last year, hundreds of cranes were killed by hailstorms. One day, three children, the eldest being eleven years old, the second nine years old, and the youngest only six years old, were playing in the outskirts near the village of Rustenburg. Suddenly, hailstones as big as chicken eggs fell. The three children looked around and saw that there was no place to hide. If they braved the hailstorm and ran back, it was a distance of two or three miles, and they would all be killed by the hailstones. The eldest child, who was very brave, quickly told the two younger children to lie down on the ground, and he lay on top of the two children to protect them. At this time, the hailstorm was very strong, and the eldest child was bruised all over from the hailstones, but he endured the pain and did not move. After a while, when the hailstorm stopped, he stood up. The two younger children were safe thanks to his protection, but he himself was severely injured. We can really admire such a brave child.</p>
<h3>Let Children Eat More Fruit</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Ripe fruits, intelligently utilized, are rich in vitamins (or vital elements) and inorganic acid salts that neutralize all acids in the body. If grown children eat more naturally ripened fruits instead of foods that are useless to the digestive organs, or even cause the digestive organs to overwork to produce unneeded starches, it is more beneficial. It is even more suitable. Modern transportation is sufficient to bring fruits from all parts of the world, even remote places, to our doorstep. Our grandmothers, upon seeing the colorful array of fresh fruits, large and small, sold in markets and street stalls, may be surprised at how much times have changed.</p>

<p>"An apple a day keeps the doctor away" is indeed an interesting saying based on experience. But according to one doctor, "The apple you eat must be a ripe one." So, when there is unripe fruit in the garden, you have to be very careful, otherwise the children will not eat the ripe ones and will eat the unripe ones, and then you will have to spend money on medical expenses.</p>
<p>Children's Chess Manual by A Jie</p>
<p>To stimulate children's intelligence and encourage their interests, in addition to origami, paper assembly, clay, bamboo, wood handicrafts, gypsum fruit making, flower lanterns, paper bird making, etc., "children's chess" is the most recommended. "Children's chess" is simple and easy to use and has a competitive nature, which is very suitable for children's tastes. Therefore, it and the various handicraft games mentioned above are all essential components of "early childhood education". Currently, there are only three or five kinds of "children's chess" in bookstores at sea, such as animal chess, sea, land, and air war chess, etc. Little do people know that there are many "children's chess" games in the folk. Now, let's give two examples. I would like to ask the teachers responsible for children's education to pay attention to these kinds of children's games!</p>
<p>(1) The dung pit chess is shown in the figure below. Each intersection point in the square is the place where each white chess piece should rush to find a way out.</p>
<p>(2) The method of eating with a rotating piece is shown in the left figure. Use twelve black and white pieces each and place them at the intersection points on the second and third lines. Then move each piece one step at a time, rotating in a circle (one, two, or three circles are all possible). Only then can the opponent's piece be eaten. Whoever eats first loses. If it is not possible to rotate in a circle and eat the other, you should first move to each intersection point for the purpose of setting up a position to circle around.</p>

<p>Some are playing marbles next to the urinal. Taking small, round crystals, drawing a square grid on the ground, and playing or hitting them with their hands! The one who hits is the winner and can hit again, winning the opponent's marbles! Some just watch with long snot hanging down!</p>
<p>Some scold each other and start fighting!</p>
<p>Some are spinning clay Buddhas at the sugar spinning stall! Giving steel plates one by one to the vendor and spinning, getting a piece of candy!</p>
<p>Some are drawing a matching picture at the guessing candy stall, and they can get a box of preserved tangerine peel or a bag of peanut candy!</p>
<p>Some are throwing dice at the dice stall. The one who wins three times can get a bowl of long-life fruit or a rotten orange!</p>
<p>Some are eating something roasted on a small stove by a small stall!</p>
<p>Some are...</p>
<p>Every day when I pass by this alley, I always see these out-of-school children living so lively and gambling so enthusiastically!</p>
<p>Oh! Our compatriots originally all like to gamble, ah!</p>
<p>If you go to a friend's house, no matter what day it is, they will always be waiting for you with three missing one! At that time, you will always have to play four rounds with them! Yes, after all, there are gambling adults, and then there are gambling children! But, ah! China's future heroes, should we just let them continue like this?</p>
<p>Once, I casually ran into an exhibition room of the January 28th War, and then I discovered a kind of image that frightened us! I saw many letters written by Japanese children to a soldier in the Japanese 9th Division; that soldier was undoubtedly an elementary school teacher; the main idea of those letters was this: "Our Mr. ××× tells us a story of a hero; that hero bravely killed many Chinese soldiers! Chinese soldiers are really the most hateful; we will step on the soil of China in the future and kill those Chinese people one by one! At that time, we will shout 'Banzai, banzai!' We want to avenge our Emperor! We are sincerely praying for the victory of our Great Japanese Empire's Imperial Army! We are waiting for our warriors to return in triumph!"</p>
<p>Some also said: "Shanghai is not as cold as Manchuria, right?"</p>
<p>Ah! My blood was flowing together, I was just silent!</p>
<p>On the way back, I was thinking, our future heroes are gambling in the small alley, next to the urinal, in front of the trash can!</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let the children eat fruit on the morning of the day instead of cereals. If they do not eat fruit for breakfast, then they must be given ripe fruit after lunch. In fact, it is also of great benefit for adults to eat fruit. The most obvious effect is to defeat constipation, make the complexion rosy, the temperament clear, the cheeks have color, and the eyes are more radiant. Therefore, fruit can not only cleanse the intestines and stomach and treat diseases, but also has nourishing value.</p>

<h3>One British Officer of the Kidnapped Nanchang Steamer Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>Bandits Put Forward Ransom Conditions</p>
<p>Of the four British officers kidnapped from the Nanchang steamer near Newchwang, Third Engineer Pearce was released from the bandit lair yesterday. According to his account of the situation in the bandit lair, all the men were untied and treated fairly well. However, he cannot currently reveal the location of their detention. Pearce carried a letter from the bandits, but at the request of the Japanese authorities, its contents are being kept secret for the time being, as announcing the bandits' demands at this time would jeopardize release negotiations. The authorities initially believed that it would take at least another week for news to come from the bandit lair, and were stunned to see Pearce's sudden return. This shows how quickly the bandits operate, specializing in kidnapping. Pearce was guided back by a Chinese man, who walked him to a point where Newchwang was in sight, where the Chinese man hired a sampan. After Pearce got on the sampan, the Chinese man left. Pearce also said that the remaining three crew members are currently safe. They saw Japanese planes flying over the place of detention, but knew that if they signaled, their lives would be in danger, so they could only watch them go. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Transfers Funds to Construction Committee for Building Small School Buildings</h3>
<p>(Nanking) Members of the Central Supervisory Committee, Tai Chi-tao and others, noted that there were over 20,000 school-age children out of school in Nanking.

They proposed to the Central Political Council that the Capital Construction Committee be temporarily closed, and the 14,000 yuan in monthly expenses be used for the construction of school buildings. It was resolved to proceed accordingly. The Capital Construction Committee is now scheduled to close at the end of April, and the funds will be transferred monthly by the Ministry of Finance to the city government for construction.

<h3>Executive Yuan Discusses Mongolian and Tibetan Issues</h3>
<p>Chang Chi's Suggestion丨丨</p>
<p>Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to Be Moved to Kalgan</p>
<p>(Nanking) The Executive Yuan held its 95th meeting on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>Shih Ching-yang, Chu Chia-hua, Ku Meng-yu, Chen Kung-po, Liu Jui-heng and others attended. Wang Chao-ming presided. Many proposals were discussed. The Mongolian and Tibetan issue was discussed in great detail. The meeting had not adjourned by noon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Central Supervisory Committee member Chang Chi said that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is located in the capital, too far from Mongolia and Tibet, which easily causes many political barriers between Mongolia and Tibet and the central government. He now intends to suggest to the central government that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission be moved to Kalgan, or that a branch office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission be established there, so that all affairs can be handled more conveniently.

<h3>Saito in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency Tokyo, 3rd. Regarding how the Japanese political situation will change after Prime Minister Saito's visit to Saionji, the observations of influential figures from various factions in the House of Peers are roughly as follows: After the Diet session ends, the Prime Minister's visit to the Genro to report on various matters is a recent practice. However, this time, Prime Minister Saito's visit to Prince Saionji differs in that his cabinet has a different structure from that of a party cabinet. Moreover, Takahashi, the Minister of Finance, does not have enthusiasm, and other cabinet ministers also lack tension. Therefore, it has a slightly different meaning from the usual visit to report on the Diet session. Although the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance hope to restore power to the parties, it is most important to restore the credibility of the parties first. The current cabinet seems to be dealing with the May 15th Incident before compiling the budget, and then retiring at an appropriate time. Therefore, it will not be as early as the Seiyukai or Minseito hope for the cabinet to fall, nor will it be as long-lived as the Minseito desires the cabinet to continue.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency Tokyo, 4th. The League of Nations sees Prime Minister Saito's visit to Saionji as a prerequisite for the cabinet's resignation and is now paying close attention to the Prime Minister's words and actions and the development of the political situation. Domestic observers believe that the purpose of Saito's visit to Saionji is to explore the Genro's true intentions regarding the political situation, in addition to reporting on the Diet session. After the Diet approves an unprecedentedly large budget, the government's responsibility for economic and financial recovery and for foreign policy issues after withdrawing from the League of Nations is very significant. However, the current cabinet lacks the enthusiasm to clean up the situation and lacks the ability. Therefore, the cooperation between the Seiyukai and Minseito, the government parties, is gradually showing cracks. The Seiyukai merely hopes to seize power, while the Minseito advocates the continuation of the current cabinet. The collapse of the cabinet has become a matter of time. Dentsu Tokyo, 4th. This morning at 9:00, Prime Minister Saito invited Finance Minister Takahashi to the Prime Minister's official residence and reported in detail on the contents of his visit to Prince Saionji. He said that Prince Saionji advised him to continue to serve in the face of the current grave situation, and he also hoped that the Minister of Finance would remain in office for the sake of the country and share the heavy responsibility. Finance Minister Takahashi agreed to consider it and left. As a result, Finance Minister Takahashi may visit Prince Saionji. At 9:00, the Prime Minister also invited Justice Minister Oyama to the official residence for the same purpose of retention.</p>
<h3>French Government Proposes New Counterproposal to Four-Power Pact</h3>
<p>Pays More Attention to Security Than British and Italian Plans</p>
<p>Revision of Treaties Differs Greatly from Original Proposals</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 3rd. After discussion, France will submit another plan for the Four-Power Pact plan agreed upon by British Prime Minister MacDonald and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome. France is now giving full consideration to the opposition of the three Little Entente countries of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania to revising the peace treaties. After careful discussion, the French cabinet has completed its draft statement, which pays more attention to security than the British and Italian plans. What it agrees with in the British and Italian plans is that the Four-Power Agreement should seek to resolve European problems through joint action, undertake not to increase armaments, and strive to reach an agreement on currency issues. However, one thing that differs greatly from the original Italian proposals is the proposal to revise the treaties. France argues that the signatory countries should comprehensively consider the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, Article 19 of the Covenant must be handled in conjunction with Articles 3, 10, 11, and 16. Article 19 stipulates that the Assembly may reconsider treaties that are no longer applicable, while Articles 3 and 10 refer to events concerning world peace and aggression against member states' territory. Therefore, France suggests that the undertaking of public security should at least be given equal weight to the revision of treaties. The French do not consider this French draft a counterproposal, but rather express the general principles in which France believes. The French draft also argues that whenever any issue arises involving any country outside the four powers, the countries concerned must always consult.</p>
<h3>British Government to Order Boycott of Russian Goods</h3>
<p>Retaliation for Arrest of British in Moscow</p>
<p>Reuters, London, A 3rd. Reuters learned tonight that the new bill on Russia that the British government plans to submit to the House of Commons authorizes the Minister of Commerce to issue orders to ban certain goods or completely prohibit their import. The government is currently consulting with overseas autonomous territories on this matter. Today, British Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons that the bill on Russia drafted after the arrest of six British technicians from Vickers Electrical Company in Soviet Russia will be submitted to the House of Commons tomorrow and must be fully passed by Wednesday. Although the British Prime Minister made this statement, he did not want to continue to elaborate on the arrest of British technicians by Soviet Russia. Labor MP Lansbury repeatedly questioned, wanting to understand the current situation before considering this bill. However, the British Prime Minister replied that it was not appropriate to publicly announce the content of the talks while the British ambassador was negotiating a new trade agreement with the Russian Foreign Minister to replace the trade agreement that expires on April 17. Lansbury also asked whether the bill on Russia was proposed because Soviet Russia arrested British technicians. The British Prime Minister said that making such a statement today would not be beneficial to those arrested, but he would make a statement when discussing this bill tomorrow or Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Protests to Germany</h3>
<p>Russians Abused in Germany</p>
<p>Russian Commercial Residence Searched</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd. Today, Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov lodged a serious protest with the German Minister in Moscow regarding the illegal arrest and abuse of Soviet Russian people in Germany, and also protested the German search of the Soviet Russian commercial representative's residence.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 3rd. The Soviet Russian government's official newspaper Izvestia criticized Germany's anti-Soviet Russian measures, saying that Germany's policy towards Soviet Russia is a provocative policy, and clearly pointed out the various groundless arrests and searches of Soviet Russian people by Germany. The newspaper also said that German Chancellor Hitler had declared a friendly policy towards Soviet Russia, but Hitler had also appointed Rosenberg as a special commissioner for internal affairs, which shows that the words of friendship are all false, because Rosenberg's opposition to Soviet Russia and his plan to separate the Ukrainian Republic from Soviet Russia are well known.</p>
<h3>British Jews Stop Boycotting German Goods</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd. Various youth groups of British Jews in the UK, with 10,000 members, held an emergency committee today and decided to stop the boycott of German goods under certain conditions, stating that in view of recent events in Germany, they are now prepared to terminate the defensive plan against the National Socialist Party, but only if they receive assurances that German Jews will no longer be discriminated against. If such assurances cannot be obtained, they will continue to carry out systematic propaganda against the National Socialist Party.</p>
<h3>Jews Leaving Germany</h3>
<p>German Government Orders Crackdown</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 3rd. Due to rumors of many Jews leaving the country, the German government suddenly issued an order last night stating that no one is allowed to leave the country without a special permit stamp from the police on their passport. Since the issuance of this order, events such as the departure of thousands of Jews last week have completely stopped today. Professor Reinhardt is one of the latest victims of today's anti-Jewish movement. He had a long relationship with the Deutsches Theater, but has now been forced to sever ties with the theater. It is now known that the anti-Jewish movement in Germany will no longer continue. General Schleicher, chairman of the anti-Jewish movement committee, said in Munich today that most Germans may regret the cancellation of the anti-Jewish movement, but discipline should be maintained no matter what.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 3rd. The boycott of Jewish people has now ended. The initiators believe that the goal has been achieved and there is no need to continue the boycott. The scene in Berlin has returned to normal. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reported that the boycott applied to all Jewish people, regardless of distinction, which is not something that the German people can agree with, because German Jews have many strengths, especially in the medical and legal fields. These people should not be included in the boycott, and in any case, both excess and deficiency are not appropriate.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 3rd. Jewish doctors here who have contracts with various hospitals have received notices stating that the contracts will not be renewed upon expiration. Some doctors have even been dismissed before the expiration of their contracts. However, the famous surgeon Sauerbruch has refused to dismiss his Jewish assistant.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 3rd. According to responsible sources at the National Socialist Party's intelligence office, the government intends to take certain countermeasures against all German politicians and civil servants who have fled to other countries after the National Socialist Party came to power, such as levying special taxes on their pensions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Communist Party's Riot Conspiracy Discovered</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd. Detailed reports of the Japanese Communist Party's activities in Niigata Prefecture last year were only recently made known because the authorities prohibited newspapers from publishing them. Seeing the increasing activities of the Communist Party in various parts of the prefecture, the Niigata Prefecture police authorities, using the Niigata Prefecture tenant dispute as a pretext, searched 200 members of suspicious organizations on November 6, and discovered the Communist Party's conspiracy. The Communist Party planned to gather 800 members of the Niigata Prefecture branch of the All-Japan Farmers' Association to attack the big landowners in the prefecture and destroy transportation facilities within the territory. Among those arrested by the police at the time were many elementary school teachers and students from middle schools and medical colleges. They were ordered by the Communist Party's central headquarters to organize Communist Party branches in Niigata Prefecture. Several Communist Party leaders knew the danger of their situation before the police search and managed to escape. Mr. Hattori, who was executing the plan to attack the landlords, committed suicide by drowning on November 28 due to the police's vigorous pursuit. Ninety people in prison have been formally charged with disrupting public order.</p>

<h3>The United States and Philippine Independence (New York Correspondence) (March 2)</h3>
<p>The US draft concerning Philippine "independence" aims to create chaos among the Philippine masses and to provide "assistance" to American farmers. After the farmers showed their rebellious will, the US government always had to think of ways to help them. But in reality, this draft helps the National City Bank and its Cuban sugar planters, as well as certain American interests.</p>
<p>The draft gives the United States the power to continue ruling all of the Philippines, militarily, commercially, financially, judicially, and diplomatically. The draft not only retains the current rule as before, but also expands the current rule and further promotes the destruction of Philippine economic life, as the price of "independence."</p>
<p>The draft stipulates that "independence" will occur after the Philippine legislature or an agency appointed by the legislature approves the draft. After the draft is approved, the provisions of the draft constitution will also be passed. After another year, a constitutional convention will be convened in Manila. The constitution must be submitted to the US President within two years. If the US President does not approve of the constitution, it will be sent back for continued drafting. If the US President accepts it, a public vote will be held in the Philippines within four months to vote on the constitution. If the vote is negative, the current rule under the US military and administrative departments should continue. If the vote is affirmative, new elections can be stipulated within one month, and officials of the new government can be elected within three to six months.</p>
<p>After the election is over, the ten-year trial period begins. After ten years, the Philippines will be "independent." But during this ten-year period, the US President has full decision-making power over the Philippines' foreign affairs, foreign public debt, foreign trade, domestic emigrants, currency system, etc. All laws passed by the Philippine legislature must be sent to the US Congress for approval.</p>
<p>After the Philippine legislature passes the independence draft, the number of Filipinos who can immigrate to the United States will be limited to only fifty people per year, and later Filipinos will be completely prohibited from immigrating to the United States. The United States should retain the right to confiscate property, review court judgments, protect the Philippine government, and guarantee life, property, and personal freedom. The United States should retain army bases and naval ports. Every Filipino should be loyal to the United States. Philippine military officers should take an oath to be loyal to the United States. Public debt should be subject to the restrictions set by the US Congress. No taxes should be levied on religious, charitable, and educational institutions. American groups and American people should receive equal rights and equal treatment. English should be used for teaching in schools. Religious tolerance should be guaranteed.</p>
<p>From the start of the trial period, free trade should cease. Exports of more than 850,000 tons of sugar, more than 200,000 tons of coconut oil, and more than 3 million pounds of Manila hemp and silk per year should be subject to prescribed tariffs. The Philippine government should levy a 5% export tax on these tariff-free items starting from the seventh year, and a 25% export tax starting from the tenth year.</p>
<p>Let us now study the economic basis of this activity of the US Congress. First of all, there are the Cuban sugar interests, who rely on the help of the National Bank and unite with reactionary farmers' groups. They all want to eliminate the competition from Philippine sugar.</p>
<p>Groups controlled by rich farmers and bankers are also supporters of Philippine "independence." Rich farmers who grow sugar, tobacco, and other products are willing to eliminate Philippine competition by means of Philippine "independence."</p>
<p>The American Federation of Labor, because it hopes to distance itself from Filipinos and all Asian workers, also advocates "independence." Naturally, they are concerned about events concerning the working class and the poor peasantry, but not as deeply and earnestly as they are concerned about the wishes of their imperialist bosses.</p>
<p>Hoover even opposed this seemingly generous concession to the Philippines. He pointed out that this draft is expected to cause "the collapse of the Philippine government," saying that as a result, "in order to avoid the very serious danger of future disputes, in order to avoid the launch of wars between the United States and other countries, military action will be necessary to defend against the intrusion of other forces or to maintain internal order." He said that the entire economic life of the Philippines "relies entirely on the convenience of trade with the United States." The United States now spends 38% of the Philippines' total income on the expenses of the Philippine and American armies and navies there. He is deeply concerned that a declaration of independence is enough to weaken American authority in the Far East.</p>
<p>If we study the economic foundation of the Philippines, it is not difficult to know that this draft is prepared to destroy the Philippine economy. Almost all Philippine trade is with the United States. Now that various restrictions and obstacles are being implemented, it is intentional to destroy this trade. Exports in 1909 were 14.7 million US dollars, 124.5 million US dollars in 1929, and 100.5 million US dollars in 1930, of which exports to the United States accounted for four-fifths. According to the estimate of US Secretary of Commerce Chapin, if the planned tariffs had been implemented in 1930, exports to the United States would have decreased by 64%. A reporter for the "New York Times" estimated that once Philippine free trade ends, exports to the United States will decrease by 66 million US dollars, and imports from the United States to the Philippines will decrease by 57 million US dollars. Of the 97 million US dollars of capital invested by the United States in the Philippines, 83% will be reduced.</p>
<p>With great obstacles to Philippine commerce, in the future it will inevitably suffer from the competition of neighboring countries and neighboring colonies. Philippine sugar will not be able to compete with Javanese or Cuban sugar in the world market. Philippine coconut oil will not be able to compete with Ceylon coconut oil. Philippine tobacco will not be able to compete with Sumatra tobacco.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the so-called "independence" is completely different from true independence and is not what the Philippine people demand. What the Philippine working masses demand is immediate independence, complete independence, the withdrawal of American troops and warships, the cancellation of all tariff barriers and immigration regulations, etc.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans Large-Scale Mining of Jehol Resources</h3>
<p>Jehol Province is the richest in mineral resources in all of China. For decades, Japan has coveted it. However, because power was then in the hands of the Chinese, the Japanese could not interfere. Since the Japanese army forcibly occupied the Northeast, the Japanese have regarded Jehol as their only lifeline. The Japanese deeply fear that after withdrawing from the League of Nations, their economy will be blockaded by the great powers. To resist the great powers, they must seize Jehol urgently. Therefore, the Japanese army used its barbaric tactics again, and Jehol Province was forcibly occupied. It is found that Jehol Province covers an area of approximately 11,000 square li. Only 2-3% of the land has been cultivated. Except for forests, most of it is mountainous, connected to the Songling Mountains in the east and the Yinshan Mountains in the west. The total reserves of gold, silver, copper, and coal buried in between are estimated to be 120 million tons to 2 billion tons.</p>
<p>(Xinqiu Coal Mine) Located 7 li northeast of Fuxin County, the reserves are about 200 million tons (some say 1 billion tons). According to the currently discovered mining area, it is indeed very extensive. The current mining operations include Xinqiu, Sunjiawan, Wu Jiegou, and Mi Jia Pu, which are jointly operated by the Da Xin Company and the Da Xing Company. Although new methods are used for mining, the scale is still very small, with an annual output of only 40,000 to 50,000 tons.</p>
<p>(Beipiao Coal Mine) Located about 80 li northeast of Chaoyang, it is a collective name for the mining areas of Longzhen, Dajijuezi, Yuejiagou, San Jia Zhan, and Jianzishan. The coal quality is excellent, with total reserves of 200,000 tons. The miners are coal mining companies operated by Chinese, with an annual output of 200,000 to 300,000 tons.</p>
<p>(Binghai Coal Mine) Located 60 li south of Lingyuan County, the coal seam is up to 17 layers or more, with each layer ranging from one foot to eight feet thick. The mining area covers 4,600 mu and has extremely rich reserves.</p>
<p>(Suzi Gou Coal Mine) Located 25 li north of Lingyuan County, the anthracite produced there is excellent. It is currently mined using local methods. The mining area and reserves are unknown.</p>
<p>(Silongtou Coal Mine) Located north of Pingquan County, on the main road to Chifeng, 8 li east of Wawu, the coal seam is four to five feet thick, with reserves of up to 4 million tons.</p>
<p>(Shidafen Coal Mine) Located 30 li west of Heishui County, the coal quality is excellent and the reserves are very rich.</p>
<p>(Xiyuanbao Small Coal Mine) Located 70 li northeast of Chifeng, the coal seam ranges from ten to fourteen feet thick.</p>
<p>The locations of coal mines in other counties are as follows:</p>
<p>(Chaoyang) Nanyang, Dataizi, Duanmutou Gou, Kou Kou Lin, Luo Guo Zhangzi, Qilinshan, Huangjing Gou, Dangjian Gou, Shenjin Gou, Dong Sanjiazi, Xiao Bianwai, Lingdi Xi, Majiazi, Cimeihua Gou, Hu Jiang Gou, Da Lianggang.</p>

<p>(Lingyuan) Tiezhangzi, Longfeng Gou, Wudao Gou Bo Li Kou, Songshu Ling, Shimenzi Gou, Kangjia Gou, She Li Gou, Pingtaizi, Bianjia Gou, Boluo Dong, Shimenwai, Nan Shao.</p>
<p>Coal Mine △ Gold Mine (乂) Oil Mine</p>
<p>Oil and other stable mineral resources are countless. However, because the Mongolian people of Jehol Province have a superstition against disturbing the soil, most of these treasures within the Mongolian territory have not been mined. South of Chifeng, the mineral resources that have already begun to be mined are mostly operated by the Han Chinese. According to recent surveys by the Japanese, the amount of each mined resource includes 89 gold mines, 23 silver mines, 63 steel mines, 127 coal mines, and 51 oil, lead, saltpeter, and sulfur mines, totaling 352 mines. Most of the operators are Chinese civilians, with some investments from the old Northeast government. As for foreign investments, there are only the Huo Jia Di gold mine, the Kalaqin asbestos mine, and the Xinqiu coal mine. The Japanese are now investigating the number of mining areas and their reserves throughout the province, preparing for large-scale mining in the shortest possible time. The initial survey by the Japanese is as follows:</p>
<h3>Coal Mines</h3>
<p>Most of the coal mining areas in Jehol Province are distributed in the Songshan Mountains. They include (Jianping) Pingding Gou, Songshu Tai, Zhuanzi Shan,</p>
<p>(Pingquan) Songshu Tai, Heishan Kou, Lao Jun Miao, San Dao Gou, Yinzi Yu Miyun Xiang, Gang You Miao, Kuai Lie Shan Miao Er Liang, Suzi Shan, Dong Jian Yangzi,</p>

<h3>Celebrating the Third Children's Day</h3>
<p>Revitalizing the Nation and its People is the Responsibility of Today's Children</p>
<p>Elementary School Students' Speech: Health and Saving the Nation is Most Practical</p>
<p>April 4th is our country's national Children's Day. Today is the third anniversary celebration. The Shanghai Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee held a commemorative meeting at the Penglai Grand Theater in the city at 8:30 this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Commemorative Program) (1) Everyone stands at attention, (2) Pays the highest respect to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of the late Premier, (3) Sings the Party Song, (4) The Chairman respectfully reads the late Premier's will, (5) The Chairman,</p>
<p>Reports, (6) Speeches, (7) Performances and Games, (8) Screening of Children's Films, (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>(Attendees) Including Mayor Wu Zhongcheng (represented by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun), Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen (represented by Secretary Feng Shuluan), Social Affairs Bureau Chief Wu Xingya, Health Bureau Chief Li Tingan, Education Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan, Secretary Zhou Shang, Public Security Bureau Inspector General Gong Xikui, and inspectors, bureau chiefs, section chiefs, section members, and more than a thousand elementary and middle school students from Danhua, First Experimental Elementary School, Wuben, Yangzheng, Shangwen, Qingguang, Longde, Aiqun, Xicheng, Meixi, Tangwan, Shihua Wanzhu, Shanghai, etc. Yu Hongjun, Feng Shuluan, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Li Tingan, and others were elected as the presidium, with Peng Qubing as the master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>(Scene) The venue was set up in the Penglai Grand Theater. Above the main entrance hung the sign "Shanghai Third Children's Day Commemorative Meeting." The entire venue was maintained in order by Public Security Bureau Inspector General Gong Xikui, leading inspectors, police officers, and Shanghai Middle School Boy Scouts. Staff from the Education, Social Affairs, and Health Bureaus were dispatched to receive guests. The Health Bureau dispatched several ambulances for first aid.</p>
<p>(Chairman's Report) After the meeting and paying respects, Chairman Yu Hongjun delivered a brief report, stating that today is the third Children's Day in Shanghai and has great significance. In this critical period of national crisis, the significance is even more profound. The quality of a country and its people depends entirely on the quality of education. If children receive good education from a young age, they will definitely become good citizens when they grow up. The foundation of the country is built on the children, and the future of the new China depends entirely on the efforts of all the little brothers and sisters present. Please, little brothers and sisters, do not forget the national crisis and work hard to save the country. Now, you must study hard and rescue the Chinese nation's freedom and independence. Whether or not you will succeed in the future depends entirely on your efforts. You, little brothers and sisters, should take full responsibility, and then in ten, twenty, or thirty years, we will definitely become a very strong country, and so on.</p>
<p>(Director Pan's Speech) Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan said in his speech, "Today we are commemorating Children's Day, to save the country, to save the nation, is your future hope, your responsibility. We are very happy to be here today, but you must think about the compatriots in the three northeastern provinces, who are almost like slaves of a fallen country. Their basic needs for food, clothing, housing, and transportation are almost unmet, which is vastly different from your situation. We want to think about how we can make their lives the same as ours. To put it simply, this depends entirely on you children: (1) To cultivate yourselves, (2) To bear the great responsibility of saving the nation and the country."</p>
<p>(Director Wu's Speech) Then, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Xingya gave a speech, briefly stating that today is the third Children's Day, and more children are participating than in the first and second sessions, which shows everyone's enthusiasm. The well-being of the country and society depends entirely on good children. We need children who receive excellent education to create society and the country. On this Children's Day, we should think about the current foreign invasion of our country. If we can resist for a long time, we will eventually eliminate Japan. This also depends entirely on our current children. We must strengthen our bodies so that we can go to the front lines to kill the enemy. We must not forget this great hatred and keep it in our minds for a long time. In order to achieve a healthy China, we must defeat the Japanese. Then, Feng Shuluan, Li Tingan, and others gave speeches, which are omitted.</p>
<p>(Health and Saving the Nation) Next, Yi Ruzhen, a 12-year-old student representative from Shangwen Elementary School, said in her speech, "Today is Children's Day, and we should know that in this time of national crisis, we should also seek ways to save the country. Although there is so-called industrial saving the nation, it is not as practical as health saving the nation. Because with a strong physique, we are not afraid of not having a strong country. This is a positive, concrete, and good way. However, we should reflect on ourselves and strive for the health of the people in order to seek the health of the country."</p>
<p>(Performances and Games) Next, students from various elementary schools performed various games, including a harmonica solo by Danhua, Butterfly Lovers by the First Experimental Elementary School, a comedy by Danhua, A Corner of Society by Danhua, Celebrating Our Army's Victory by Wuben, National Arts by Yangzheng, Blue Sky White Sun Red Earth by Shangwen, Finding Friends by Qingguang, Sheng Lu Aiqun Peach Blossom Fairy, Jinzhou's Corner by Shangwen, Magic by the First Experimental Elementary School, Persuading Compatriots Not to Buy Japanese Goods by Wuben, a Funny Dance by Xicheng, National Music by Mei Bin, Three Bright Red Blood Cells by the First Experimental Elementary School, Finding Friends by Tangwan, Berlin Garden by Shihua, Small Jujutsu by Shihua, Good Friends are Here by Aiqun, A Glorious Day by Wanzhu, and movies such as Good Times by Lianli Company, Fantastic Tales, and Difficult to Show Affection were shown until the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Wounded Soldiers of the 19th Route Army Transported to Guangdong for Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>Aides-de-Camp Assigned to Assist in Care</p>
<p>Commander Dai Comforts in the Afternoon</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident last year, many officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army were wounded. After the army went to Fujian, all the wounded soldiers were left in hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai for treatment. Commander Cai Tingkai of the army, considering that the wounded officers and soldiers were all patriotic heroes who fought for the country and the nation in the Anti-Japanese War, resulting in some being wounded and some being disabled, urgently needed to be rescued. Therefore, he specially established the Anti-Japanese Military Disabled Rehabilitation Institute in Henan, Guangzhou, to accommodate the wounded officers and soldiers. All the wounded soldiers left in Beijing and Shanghai have been ordered to be transported to Guangzhou. The wounded soldiers in Beijing arrived in Shanghai yesterday. After the wounded soldiers from Hangzhou arrive in Shanghai today, they will be concentrated and depart from Shanghai on a Guangzhou-bound ship. Commander Dai is scheduled to visit and comfort them this afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>After receiving the above order, the army's Beijing office transported more than 140 wounded soldiers from Beijing to Shanghai on the China Merchants Bureau Guangli chartered ship. The ship arrived late last night. For convenience, the ship docked at the pier on the side of the Gaochangmiao Shipyard.</p>
<h3>Care at the Pier</h3>
<p>When the ship arrived, the local military immediately dispatched a platoon of military police and soldiers from the Public Bureau Police Brigade Naval Guard Battalion to the pier to take care of them. Most of the wounded soldiers went ashore for a walk this morning. Some had amputated arms, while others walked with canes after having their feet amputated.</p>
<h3>Escorting Personnel</h3>
<p>The wounded soldiers who came to Shanghai from Beijing were led by Zheng Gujian from the Beijing office of the army's 60th, 61st, and 78th divisions. Each division also sent an aide-de-camp to assist in the care, including Yu Huidong from the 60th Division, Deng Guoxiang from the 61st Division, and Xu Maoshan from the 78th Division.</p>
<h3>Concentration of Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>In addition to the wounded soldiers in Beijing and Hangzhou, there are more than 100 wounded soldiers in Shanghai (including wounded officers), stationed in hospitals such as the Poverty Relief and Benefit Baolong Hospital. They have been notified to board the ship tonight. The wounded soldiers from Hangzhou, about 100 people, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou this morning and are expected to arrive this afternoon and will be concentrated.</p>
<h3>Commander Dai's Comfort</h3>
<p>This morning, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency met with Zheng Gujian from the army's Beijing office, who said that after the wounded soldiers from Hangzhou and Shanghai are concentrated and boarded the ship, they will set sail from Shanghai tomorrow morning, first to Xiamen, and then to Lushan. Commander Dai Ji of the Songhu Garrison Command is scheduled to come here this afternoon to comfort them after the wounded soldiers from Hangzhou arrive in Shanghai. There is also a batch of military horses going to Xiamen, which were purchased in Shandong Province and are also being transported on the ship. In addition, for the convenience of the wounded soldiers in changing medicine, the Garrison Command's Military Medical Office has been asked to send two military doctors to accompany them, he said.</p>

Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet at his private residence on Haige Road this afternoon to welcome Li, with Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Jingjiang, and others in attendance. It is reported that Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, will also enter Beijing tonight.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Belgian Minister to be Permanently Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Inspected the Belgian Consulate This Morning</p>
<p>The newly appointed Belgian Minister to China, Mr. Ji Youmu, arrived in Shanghai on the Conte Rosso ship yesterday. This morning, at 10:00 AM, accompanied by Chargé d'Affaires Ge Lafu, he went to the Belgian Consulate on Lafayette Road for inspection. According to sources at the Belgian Consulate, Mr. Ji is scheduled to go to Beijing within days to pay his respects to our government authorities and will also go to Peiping to inspect embassy affairs. In the future, he will be permanently stationed in Shanghai to handle all negotiations between China and Belgium. As for when he will present his credentials, it has not yet been determined.</p>

All agencies have been informed to send personnel to supervise the drawing.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Preparation for Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Giving Up Addictions, Changing Perspective</p>
<p>Regarding Zhang Xueliang's going abroad, according to those close to Zhang this morning, Zhang decided to leave Shanghai on the Italian ship Conte Rosso on the 11th. All the formalities for going abroad, such as passports, have been completed. In addition to what has been reported in the newspapers, there is also a French female secretary, Ms. Shen, and a Western doctor as an attendant. Zhang's addiction has been stopped according to the doctor's advice, changing his old perspective, it is said.</p>
<h3>Recent Report on Yoshizawa's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Talk with Counselor Arita</p>
<p>Uncertain Departure Date From Shanghai</p>
<p>The former Japanese Minister to China, Kenkichi Yoshizawa, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, which has attracted the attention of Chinese and foreign people. However, according to Yoshizawa, this trip is purely a private tour and has no mission whatsoever. This morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Arita, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy who is close to Yoshizawa, at the Japanese Consulate General. According to Arita, since arriving in Shanghai, Yoshizawa has only visited the Zhabei battlefield and played golf in western Shanghai with friends every day, and has not met with any important Chinese figures. All the rumors are speculation. As for the date of Yoshizawa's departure from Shanghai, it has not been determined. The report that he is scheduled to leave Shanghai this Thursday is not accurate, because Yoshizawa has not yet expressed any intention to leave Shanghai. Whether or not he will go to Beijing has not yet been decided, but he will definitely not travel to the Yangtze River area. As far as he knows, Yoshizawa may travel to Tianjin and Beiping, and then return to the Northeast to return to China.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xianglin Sets Off for the United States</h3>
<p>Zhang Xianglin, the plenipotentiary representative of our country's participation in the Chicago Exposition, the Product Association, left Shanghai this morning at 9:00 AM on the President Taft to go to the United States to handle matters such as building the Chinese exhibition hall.</p>
<h3>New Initiatives of the Two Railway Bureaus</h3>
<p>Plan to Repay Sino-British Loans</p>
<p>Inspecting Stations to Understand the Truth</p>
<p>Soon to Host Shanghai Press</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Boqiao, the director of the Two Railway Bureaus, has been actively engaged in reforms since taking office. This morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Mr. Huang at the bureau, and was met by Mo Heng, the director of the General Affairs Office, who released information on the recent situation of the two railways as follows:</p>
<p>Repaying Debts: The Two Railway Bureaus owe a huge amount of debt to the Sino-British Banking Corporation. Because the railway business cannot be developed and has suffered major losses from the Songhu War, the debt has not been repaid for a long time. Since Director Huang took office, he has actively rectified the railway business to increase the income of the railway bureau so that it can repay the accumulated debts as scheduled. It has been decided to extract 5% of the daily income of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and 10% of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to be deposited in the Mae Fung Bank as a guarantee for the repayment of Sino-British loans. In the future, if the railway business develops, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway can increase the extraction to 10% and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway can increase the extraction to 15%.</p>
<p>Inspecting Railway Business: In order to understand the actual situation of each station of the two railways, Director Huang has decided to personally inspect each station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway on the 6th of this month to understand the truth for the sake of reform. After the inspection of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is completed, he will inspect each station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, but the date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Hosting the Press: In order to rectify the internal organization, the bureau has laid off a large number of soldiers, which has caused many disputes. Director Huang had to make a statement to all sectors of society about this matter, and because the Two Railway Bureaus are state-owned transportation agencies as a whole, it is necessary to publicly report all internal situations so that the people of the whole country understand the actual situation of the railway. Therefore, he has recently sorted out all affairs in detail, and after the inspection of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is completed, he will return to Shanghai and host reporters from various newspapers in this city at the bureau to report on all the recent situations of the bureau.</p>
<h3>Three Batches of Antiquities Can Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>Due to the Large Number of Boxes, Loading Takes Time</p>
<p>Jiangtian Will Head East Today and Arrive Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Three batches of antiquities from the Palace Museum, together with antiquities from the Summer Palace and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, totaling 3,922 boxes, were transported to Pukou a few days ago. Starting in the early morning of the 2nd, they were transported from the train to the Jiangtian ship. It was originally scheduled to be transported by about 4:00 PM on the 3rd, and the ship was scheduled to set sail for Shanghai that night, and it should be able to arrive at noon on the 4th. According to the Shanghai Antiquities Storage Office's telegram from Nanjing this afternoon (the 4th), due to the large number of boxes, the three batches of antiquities were not transported until about 9:00 PM on the 3rd. The Jiangtian ship set sail east at 10:00 AM today and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at noon tomorrow (the 5th) and berth at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Construction Department Expedites Repairs on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway</h3>
<p>From Zhaolin to Jinshan Section</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway on October 10th last year, pedestrians have been coming and going continuously, and they all say it is convenient. Last month, the section of the route from Zhaolin to Jinshan, about 35 kilometers long, suddenly collapsed, making it bumpy and difficult to travel. This section of the highway belongs to the territory of Jiangsu Province, so the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction ordered the Road Works Management Office to start construction and rebuild the roadbed. It has been more than a month now, and it has not yet been completed. Traveling on it is not only very difficult, but also extremely dangerous. At this time of bright spring and many tourists, it is a pity that it is not repaired immediately, giving people the feeling that the road to Shu is difficult. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, in view of this, sent personnel to supervise the Road Works Management Office to expedite repairs. It is reported that most of the work has been completed, but there is still a small section that is being paved, so driving is still slightly inconvenient. In the shortest possible time, the work can be completed completely.</p>
<h3>Lin Wojiang Talks About the Flying Club</h3>
<p>The Aviation School is Not Stopping</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association is preparing to set up a flying club. Lin Wojiang has now drafted a plan, which will be opened after being approved by the Standing Council. This morning, Lin Wojiang told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that the report that the association was preparing to set up an aviation school, which has been suspended, is not true. However, the preparation of the aviation school cannot be completed in a short time. Since it is called a school, it must have a considerable scale, which is difficult to achieve quickly. In order to urgently train pilots, the flying club will be established first, and the school will not be closed after the flying club is established. The flying club is a foreign flying club, and its purpose is to promote the public's interest in the aviation industry and to train pilots in an economical and simple way. The reason why it is called a flying club and not a flying club is to avoid misunderstanding and to recognize that this kind of organization is the same as an ordinary club, and is only for entertainment. All the strong countries in Europe and the United States have this kind of organization, especially the United Kingdom, which has 52 clubs across the country. Its establishment method is very useful for us to learn from. Therefore, the proposed plan is to refer to the national conditions and adopt the experience of the United Kingdom. After being approved by the Standing Council, the club will be set up near Hongqiao. In addition, the book "The Founding and General Situation of the Chinese Aviation Association" compiled by the Propaganda Group of the Association was published yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Police Pay Attention to Counterfeit Banknotes</h3>
<p>Report to the Nearest Police Station if Discovered</p>
<p>The Chinese-language newspaper Zilinbao reports that in recent weeks, someone has been using counterfeit five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes from several well-known banks in the market. Many people have been victimized. Although the police have arrested several people, they are all users, and the main culprit has not yet been captured. These counterfeit tickets are printed using copperplate printing. Just a casual observation of the printing, color, and paper quality will easily reveal them. If anyone discovers these counterfeit tickets, they can report them to the nearest police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Mingyuan Liquidation News</h3>
<p>The Dalu News reports that the Mingyuan Dog Racing Track held a special meeting at the Homing Chamber of Commerce yesterday and passed a resolution to liquidate the company. It was also resolved to hire accountants Wilkinson and Black to jointly handle the liquidation affairs. A second special meeting will be held at the Homing Chamber of Commerce in forty-eight days to confirm the resolution passed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Argentine Wheat Will Be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be Shipped at the End of This Month</p>
<p>10,000 Tons to be Shipped to Tianjin and Hankou</p>
<p>The 20,000 tons of American wheat that the local Chinese flour mill previously ordered from Argentina. This morning, the Shanghai side received a telegram from the wheat merchant there saying that it has now been scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai at the end of this month. After 10,000 tons arrive in Shanghai, they will be transshipped to Tianjin and Hankou.</p>

<h3>"Undercover," "Traitor," and "Fermentation"</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>When I was a child, reading old novels, whenever a bandit's den or a wealthy manor was being raided, there was always the so-called "undercover" method. Someone would be sent ahead to pretend to surrender, and then, with internal and external coordination, they would be captured in one fell swoop. I couldn't help but feel that this was a clever way to subdue the enemy.</p>
<p>The so-called hero originally contains the meaning of "able to bend and stretch," meaning that one should be fearless in the face of great difficulties, calm, and not be bound by minor details, such as integrity and shame. The person who goes "undercover," although subjected to temporary humiliation, ultimately grasps the final victory. A hero remains a hero.</p>
<p>Since chivalrous novels ceased to be written, this meaning has become a thing of the past. However, since the "September 18th Incident," the so-called "traitors" have emerged, and we suddenly realize that this practice still exists in the world. The name may be slightly different, but the meaning is essentially the same.</p>
<p>Because most people do not excuse the painstaking efforts of "traitors," believing that they willingly become slaves to a fallen country, they feel the difficulty of knowing and judging people. History is constantly changing; the old perishes, and the new is born. Can you say that the forerunners and successful people who save the country are not this kind of people?</p>
<p>When the Mongol cavalry marched into China, we had a group of people singing their praises. The same was true when the Manchus entered the customs. But now, can you find the power of the Mongols or the echoes of the Tartar whips? "If you want to take something, you must first give it." This is the essence of Chinese philosophy. How can "hard work" compare to "soft work"?</p>
<p>In chemistry, there is the so-called "fermentation." This method can be applied even more widely in China, not only in making wine and soy sauce but also in playing a significant role in saving the country. This is known by foreigners who are experienced in China, such as Morrison and others. To prove that breaking the enemy's fortress, "undercover" is indeed a good method, but even with "internal response," what is valued is still having "external cooperation." The procedures are quite troublesome, making it somewhat imperfect. Thus, "traitors" are superior.</p>
<p>The role of "traitors" is to make the enemy ferment. In technical terms, it is called "luring the enemy deep." Then, add a little "paralysis," "appeasement," and other Chinese rhetoric. We have plenty of these things. It's enough to intoxicate the cavalry and topple the wooden clogs. There is no need for "internal response," let alone seeking "external cooperation." Soldiers need not shed blood, and the rivers and mountains are still ours. Isn't this the best method? It is a pity that these noble-minded people who do not claim credit for their achievements are lost in historical national records, leaving only a few relatively well-known figures like Hong Chengchou and Shi Tianni. This is what should be noted when compiling the history of the Republic of China in the future.</p>
<h3>About "Saving the Country Through Aviation"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>After the "January 28th Incident," the people of the country deeply learned a great lesson, knowing that in modern warfare, without airplanes, the entire army is like blind men and blind horses, not only unable to see the enemy's military situation but also suffering from the extreme terror and threats imposed by the enemy. In the "January 28th" battle, the greatest suffering felt by our army, who can say that it was not due to the lack of airplanes?</p>
<p>Recently, Rehe fell, and the Great Wall area has been severely oppressed by enemy aircraft. Our army's positions were destroyed, and civilian houses were bombed, while enemy aircraft flew calmly in the sky, bombing east and west according to their bestial desires. As a result, the entire country has thoroughly realized the importance of airplanes in modern warfare, so the whole country is mobilized, shouting "Save the country through aviation!" In just a short time, a large amount of donations have been raised. If the whole country were like Shanghai, knowing the opportunity of a year, airplanes with the "Blue Sky White Sun" emblem would be able to compete in the sky with enemy aircraft and achieve final victory.</p>
<p>However, when everything is in the midst of the high-sounding call of "saving the country through aviation," I would like to offer the following advice to the authorities: (1) training of pilots, (2) establishing factories to manufacture our own airplanes, and (3) manufacturing our own gasoline. Last year, Guangdong airplanes and Hangzhou Aviation School airplanes crashed, airplanes were burned, and pilots died tragically. Recently, a Guangdong airplane crashed into a mountain and burned, and two pilots were buried together in the raging flames (see the Guangzhou correspondence in the March 21st issue of Shen Bao). What is the difference between such flights and children's play? It is simply a waste of airplanes and lives. Therefore, in the voice of "saving the country through aviation," what urgently needs to be resolved first, of course, is the training of flight personnel, so that there are as many flight personnel as car drivers, and they must also be skilled and agile!</p>
<p>Regarding the source of airplanes and gasoline, if we rely solely on foreign supplies and do not set up factories to manufacture them ourselves, what a large amount of money will flow out of this bottomless vessel! In other words, instead of taking money to buy from foreign countries, it would be better for everyone to simply send the donations they are willing to make to foreigners! This will not only make it difficult for "aviation" to "save the country," but it will even create a new and greater crisis. However, then again, I am not crazy enough to promote that everyone should not donate money to buy airplanes, and I dare not advocate giving money to foreigners for nothing. I am just saying that if "aviation" is to truly "save the country," we must have technically "skilled pilots to fly our own" airplanes and burn "our own" gasoline! Otherwise, I still have to say: "It will create a new and greater crisis!"</p>

<h3>Passing Zhabei</h3>
<p>— Yu Heqin</p>
<p>I remember the lone army being surrounded at night, admiring the heroism of Jiang and Cai, wives and children scattered in a panic as they stormed the gates, heads flying in droves. I stood on a precarious building, frequently pointing my finger, just in time to see knives being wielded on a narrow road. The dilapidated walls and fallen beams are still like yesterday. Where have the millions of souls gone? Hundreds of craftsmen lived and worked, forming a market, but a fire turned it into smoke in a matter of days. The altar and steps were covered with moss and night moonlight, blue phosphorescence and white bones scattered in the overgrown fields. Ghosts should weep at the ambition to resist foreign invaders, the army has returned without succeeding in expanding territory. I still remember the urgency of life and death for the front lines, while officials in ceremonial dress were discussing mysteries in the halls.</p>
<h3>When in Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>Spring has come to the world, and a fragrant scent is blowing in the rain. The little birds on the branches are turning their reed-like tongues, singing beautiful songs. The entire universe is filled with vibrant air. The big sale flags of major stores are fluttering in the spring breeze. Urban girls have changed out of their heavy fur coats and put on thin cheongsams; the flames of youth are already burning in their hearts. The strings of young people's hearts are playing. God of spring, what do you bring us? The sounds of gunfire from a year ago no longer linger in everyone's active heart. This is the beginning of 1933. God, it is time for us to be in love!</p>
<p>On Nanjing Road at night, cars returning from movie theaters and going to dance halls alternate. On a Saturday of revelry, enjoyment is easier to remember. Even the sidewalks are crowded with various urban animals. Spring has come to the world, it is time for us to be in love! From every smiling face, such a song is vaguely floating.</p>
<p>Every tram arrives, dropping off many people, and at the same time being filled by other candidates. In the spring air, vibrant phenomena are scattered everywhere. The boy selling evening newspapers also skips lightly, shouting in the crowd the cry of "Great Battle in Rehe! Japanese defeated!" For the price of five copper coins, they flip through to see if there is news of a five-year-old girl being raped. Japanese defeated! After reading the big headline, they smile at the back of the boy running away, as if saying, "You know how to do business." There is no other expression. Originally, it was only the price of five copper coins. Besides, there are charming eyes under willow leaf eyebrows watching. Every tram arrives, dropping off many people, and at the same time being filled by other candidates.</p>
<p>People are standing in front of the large glass window, those in the back want to move forward, those in the front are not allowed to move over, so a big commotion occurs every second. Heads piled on top of heads, heads next to heads, like a storm, a three-headed man in a straight uniform is sent over. The fluctuating heads are scattered like a spring breeze.</p>
<p>Inside the glass window is a girl in a wedding dress, her hands grasping the hem of her dress. Beautiful eyes are looking forward, smiling at everyone who is watching. Set against the three-dimensional background, it makes the breath of spring even more vibrant. That three-headed man is also greedily staring.</p>
<p>The girl is precisely the object of love, marriage is precisely the fruit of love. Spring has come to the world, and the flame of the time to be in love has stirred the attraction of the audience. After the three-headed man disappeared, the girl in the wedding dress in the glass window was surrounded by even more people.</p>
<p>The boy with the Bao Da Evening News forgot his profession. Although he doesn't have such dreams, he also has the flame of youth, his flame can also burn, so his head is also watching like ordinary people, and who knows, he may be hoping for a windfall, grabbing the girl who is the object of public attention into his arms.</p>
<p>Spring has come to the world, it is time for us to be in love!</p>
<p>The sounds of gunfire from a year ago no longer linger in everyone's active heart, but the sounds of the second gunfire are stirring again in another spring air. Friends who are drunk in the spring dream, wake up! Change the direction you are looking from the glass window and see, will we still have time to be in love?</p>
<p>Equal Treatment?</p>
<h3>Scarves</h3>
<p>— Ren Guo</p>
<p>[Ornaments]</p>
<p>Anyone who lives in Shanghai knows that things here are special. Whether it's clothing or other items, they are all very different from elsewhere, because Shanghai is more modernized than other places.</p>
<p>Let's take scarves as an example. Originally, scarves were mostly woven from wool or crocheted with yarn. Their function was to prevent cold air from blowing into the head and neck. But now there is a kind of scarf that is not woven from wool or crocheted with yarn, but is made of silk, which is lustrous and shiny. However, in the current mid-spring weather, when the temperature is between sixty and seventy degrees, you can still see sons of wealthy families wearing these scarves. Aren't they using these scarves as ornaments? But I don't understand what the benefit is of wearing a scarf in such hot weather. It would be better to hang a few banknotes around their necks to show off their wealth. Ah! It's truly "the poor have no food to eat, while the rich are satiated."</p>
<p>Correspondences from Shop Employees</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I feel that times have changed. The business community today can no longer be successful using only the management methods of the 19th century. We watch as the business communities of other countries progress rapidly, while we? We still follow the old methods passed down by our ancestors, crawling like snails.</p>
<p>Many people in the business community have already realized the hunger for new commercial knowledge, such as modern accounting, advertising, marketing, statistics, scientific management, and various new and advanced business knowledge. But we also feel a very painful thing, which is where to learn from, where to get this knowledge? I firmly believe that this kind of specialized knowledge cannot be understood by simply buying a couple of books to read. There must be expert guidance in order to understand.</p>
<p>I also know that there is a National School of Commerce and a University of Shanghai School of Commerce in Shanghai, both of which can provide part-time workers with the opportunity to study more advanced knowledge. However, 80 or 90 percent of the books they use are in English. Those who have not studied English much can only sigh in despair! Also, the most strange and incomprehensible thing is why they make the admission requirements so strict: you must have a high school diploma to be able to take the exam. Those without a diploma, even if they have equivalent academic ability, are rejected from a distance. Thus, people like me, who, due to circumstances, have not graduated from high school, can never dream of seeking more advanced knowledge again. The reason why they want a diploma is nothing more than to check whether the academic ability is enough. If it is not enough, I am afraid that listening to the lectures will not be beneficial. But it is really not right to refuse those out-of-school youth who have equivalent academic ability but do not have a diploma from participating in the entrance exam!</p>
<p>There must be many, many shop employees and workers in the business community who are eager to seek more advanced business knowledge, and there are not few who share the same situation and sympathy as me. Sir, do you have any appropriate solutions to this problem?</p>
<p>Another thing: I feel that it would be very beneficial for "part-time" readers to communicate with each other during their spare time to talk about any and all issues; and it is also the best way to pass the time. I would very much like to benefit from this kind of mutual learning, and I am very willing for readers to correspond with me. I hope that you can disclose this letter and my mailing address so that everyone can discuss it.</p>
<p>My mailing address is: No. 15, Lane 140, Xinzha Road, Shanghai. I wish you</p>
<p>Vigorous writing! From Jiang Baobao</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The two schools mentioned by Mr. Jiang are indeed the best places in Shanghai to study advanced business knowledge on a part-time basis. The reason why their textbooks are used in English, according to our conjecture, is nothing more than the following two reasons.</p>
<p>(1) There are no appropriate Chinese textbooks. The fact is that there are too few commercial books written in Chinese that are relatively advanced.</p>
<p>(2) Because England is still, in fact, holding the reins of world commerce, those who study advanced commerce also have the need to learn English. But we think that the second reason is not very sufficient; even if there are those who wish to learn English, an English course should be set up separately. The first reason is indeed valid at present; we hope that the scholars, especially the teachers in these two schools, should translate these books to solve this difficulty. As for the admission requirements, it is originally a serious matter to require a high school diploma. However, the pain mentioned by Mr. Jiang is also a real situation, and we hope that it will be modified within the possible range. Mr. Jiang can directly request them with these two points.</p>

<h3>Time in Dreams (Continued 20)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"What does this mean?" He couldn't help but want to give a "frank reprimand."</p>
<p>"To be honest with you, dear old brother," Zhao Qianli's recently fattened face revealed a very proud, very contemptuous sneer. "We did used to be friends, that's right, and it's right that you come to me for help. But right now, I no longer have the need to continue being friends with you, and in the future, there's even less need to have any friendship with you. In other words, in your Shanghai news circles, I've already met a few people who are more powerful than you. There's simply nothing you can do for me! So, me hiring a secretary would not be able to fob off other people? Therefore, I'm willing to use my position to pay a considerable price to take back our old friendship. Daketouwu, I've always been the most straightforward speaker, you probably won't get angry, right?"</p>
<p>Wu Yi jumped up like a wounded lion, flames of anger spewing from his eyes, his chest rising and falling rapidly. If he had a weapon at that moment, he would have ignored everything and staged a bloody tragedy.</p>
<p>"Her! I respectfully wish you, with twelve points of sincerity, that your children and grandchildren, generation after generation, will always be the accounting director of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government of the Republic of China!" Unable to resort to violence, but unable to keep his anger inside, Wu Yi bowed and retreated with an unnatural smile.</p>
<p>(11) Sister-in-law</p>
<p>The lesson that Zhao Qianli gave Wu Yi caused him to thoroughly awaken. From then on, he abandoned all delusions and quietly continued to work hard at his existing profession like water in a small river, teaching during the day and going to the newspaper office at night; when he was free, he would hold his son at home. At that time, his wife, Ms. Liu Suzhen, had already given birth to a very healthy son for him.</p>
<p>"In China, the more people who really study hard, the less promising they are. Luckily, I wasn't the kind of character who always got first or second place in the exams, otherwise I'm afraid I wouldn't even be able to eat this bowl of rice!" After Wu Yi gradually realized the true face of Chinese society, not only was he not indignant or resentful that he could not become successful like other PhDs, but he also forgave the "great change in people's hearts" of his two old friends, Zhao Qianli and Lin Daping, believing that this was the norm for "modern friends"; but the more true his understanding of society was, the smaller his courage became. He knew that if he, such an uncivilized person still possessing three points of passion, wanted to avoid anger, be greedy for life, and eat in peace, he could only implement a policy of closing the door to guests. Once this policy was implemented, Wu Yi immediately turned into a Robinson Crusoe-style Shanghainese, not only completely severing ties with all ordinary friends, but even the last remaining old friend, Wang Yulin, gradually became estranged.</p>
<p>"Tonight, no matter what, please come to my house!" One afternoon of the Dragon Boat Festival, Yulin suddenly called Wu Yi, his voice very urgent and excited. "Lao Wu, please make a trip no matter what, this matter is of great importance to you personally, don't forget! We are No. 16, Alley XX, remember!"</p>
<p>Because Ms. Liu was a classmate of Yulin's wife, Ms. Mao Jufen, she often went to Yulin's house, but Wu Yi had never been there. When he talked to Yulin, it was always in Yulin's office; therefore, Yulin specifically told him his address again on the phone.</p>
<p>"Ah! What a quiet place!" That night, after six o'clock, Wu Yi had already arrived at the entrance of Alley XX where Yulin lived from his own home. This is a famous residential area in Shanghai, far from the streets, as quiet as the countryside. Short iron railings protect the emerald green cemetery, and even the air seems to be much fresher. Wu Yi couldn't help but blurt out in admiration.</p>

<h3>Several Famous Old Pairs</h3>
<p>— Shen</p>
<p>For example, when you watch football, basketball, and all other competitions, having good partners and a perfect spirit of cooperation is what makes the audience excited. The same is true on the screen. Two actors with good skills and experience, partnering in a film, can better bring out their individual personalities, styles, appearances, and skills due to the mutual contrast.</p>
<p>On the screen, the most famous old pair is of course Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, who became famous for "Seventh Heaven." Although for a time, filmmakers feared that their respective marriages would affect their productions. But their fears were fortunately not realized, and films such as "Street Angel," "The First Year," and "Sunny Side Up" were not affected. Now that this partnership has been broken up due to Farrell's departure from Fox, we are so sadly regretful that the screen can no longer have them appear together.</p>
<p>Fredric March and Jeanette MacDonald are also an old pair on the screen. After they enjoyed immense fame from Ernst Lubitsch's "The Love Parade," Paramount's attention to them was just like Fox's treatment of Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell. The recent "Smilin' Through" is also a collaborative product of theirs. As for their appearances, Fredric March is a standard of ardent men, while Jeanette MacDonald is suitable for roles of wealth, nobility, and luxury.</p>
<p>The most recently famous pair is probably James Dunn and Sally Eilers of "Bad Girl." Jim and Sally were both raised in New York. Jim is 28 years old, and Sally is three years younger than him. They have both been extras, but Jim once performed on stage. Sally came to Hollywood in 1926. Initially, she starred in Pathe comedies. However, after "Dance Team," there has been no news of Fox combining them in films, such as "Hold Me Tight" and "Sailor's Luck" (both films have not arrived in Shanghai). The former stars Jim, while the latter only has traces of Sally.</p>
<p>Another newly discovered pair is Irene Dunne and Preston Foster. They are not very famous, but they were very successful in their initial famous work, MarriedinHaste.</p>
<p>Among the male-male pairs, the ones we know best are of course Laurel and Hardy. In addition, Jack Holt and Ralph Graves of First National are dedicated to the depiction of friendship. Warner Baxter and Edmund Lowe, one specializes in playing suave robbers and the other specializes in playing policemen.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Sweepstakes" (Sài Mǎ Yàn Shǐ)</h3>
<p>— Wán Shí</p>
<p>Direction is Agile, Performance is Good</p>
<p>The story of this film revolves around a young and strong racehorse jockey who often wins through extraordinary skills. He causes a sensation and is quite popular among the leisurely class. At the same time, he falls in love with a woman. Later, after losing to an opponent, he becomes disheartened. Ultimately, with the woman's encouragement, he achieves victory and marries her.</p>
<p>Speaking of the director's technique, his approach is very agile. He uses concise methods to narrate the story, so we don't find it too annoying, even in such a mediocre subject matter. For example, the scene where the young jockey is caught by the teacher at the woman's place and has to climb into the bedroom from the roof allows us to understand that he originally escaped that way. Many comedic elements are also naturally interspersed, such as the teacher sneezing downstairs while the young man falls on the stairs in response. The director's use of camera angles is also ingenious. The editing is also good, ensuring that the entire film retains its brilliance without being chaotic.</p>
<p>As for the performances, the young Eddie Quillan's movements are very lively and commendable. He is so excited and overwhelmed by the cheers of the crowd, and he revels in his glory in the bedroom. These parts are very realistic and reveal his intelligence.</p>
<p>Among the supporting actors, the performance of the actor playing the teacher is the best. Although he should maintain a more dignified demeanor, he is not ruined by repetitive slapstick humor. The rest of the cast are very mediocre, especially the Chinese compatriot. Of course, in the play, he is only there to make the audience laugh, but his clumsy movements are indeed laughable.</p>
<p>However, the film's subject matter and intentions are worthless and despicable. We see that a jockey earns people's cheers and respect simply because he can ride a horse, and he even wins a beautiful woman. At the same time, we are led to believe that women possess special magic, as if every man should be brave and do his best under a woman's praise or teasing. Think about it: this is what the film wants to "teach" us. As for why the screenwriter chose horse racing as the subject matter? Why abandon so many more important aspects of real life and adopt such a decadent material? It is truly using film as a game. But such a film can be profitable, right? Because it is what the idle class loves to watch and finds delightful. It turns out that American movies are merely the entertainment products of Kuai Huo Lin Film Company. Xu Su Zhen from "Record of a Wild Man on a Desert Island" is now showing at the Central Theater.</p>
<p>Their entertainment, what they need is this kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, after watching it, I feel that American movies have indeed reached their end. As for the performance techniques, America should have such achievements.</p>
<h3>Falling Blossoms (Luò Yīng Bīn Fēn)</h3>
<p>— Luó Fēn</p>
<p>Mary Brian went to New York for recuperation due to illness, with the intention of retiring. Paramount is now trying its best to persuade her, and through the intercession of Huaris Pirai, she has returned to Hollywood. However, the date of her return to work has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>American actresses Greta Garbo and Katharine Hepburn, and Swedish actress Greta Garbo, are unwilling to reveal their family situations. After much exploration by busybodies, it was discovered that Katharine has two older brothers. It was also discovered that Katharine is married, and her husband is a lawyer.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert has gained immense fame since completing Cecil B. DeMille's "The Sign of the Cross". Paramount has invited her to star in a new film and has greatly increased her salary.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Allan is currently starring in a new film called "The Warrior's Husband" (QxanjorsHusoando). This is a recent photo of the beautiful star Jeanette MacDonald taken during her travels in Europe.</p>
<p>The script of this play was performed on Broadway last year, with American actress Katharine Hepburn as the lead. Hepburn was recognized by RKO Pictures in this play. Later, they hired her to go to Hollywood. The film rights have now been purchased by Paramount. Tallulah Bankhead has now been hired by New York to perform in a Broadway stage play.</p>
<p>Fox Corporation recently received a telegram from Claire Bow from Europe, stating that she is currently traveling in Paris and will not return to the US to work for the time being.</p>
<p>Although rumors of Greta Garbo's return to the US have been rampant in Hollywood, there is still no confirmation of Garbo's arrival. MGM recently received an underwater telegram from Garbo, which did not mention returning to Hollywood to work. MGM is said to be extremely anxious.</p>
<p>John Barrymore's new film is titled "Svengali" (Tapaze), and the female lead has been decided as Myrna Loy.</p>
<p>After returning from New York, Mary Brian suddenly adopted a humorous attitude. Recently, she often advises her friends to wear expensive clothes. When her friends asked her why, Mary replied, "The world now judges people by their clothes, not by their character. Look at me, I am an old and ugly woman. If it weren't for my expensive clothes, why would I be sitting on the throne of movie queen?" Those who heard this couldn't help but smile.</p>
<h3>A Bunch of Film News</h3>
<p>— Péi Yuán</p>
<p>"Blood Debt" (Xuè Zhài), produced by Star Film Company and starring Xia Peizhen, was previously banned by the Film Censorship Board. After Star repeatedly applied for leniency and made revisions to the non-compliant parts, it has now been revised, and the Censorship Board has approved its release. However, the film's name has been changed to "Red Powder Hero" (Hóng Fěn Yīng Xióng). "The Thief of Humanity" (Rén Dào zhī Zéi), co-starring Zheng Xiaoqiu and others, was also ordered by the Censorship Board to be renamed "The Precious Mirror of Morality" (Dào Fǎ Bǎo Jiàn). It is said that these two films will be released in a certain theater in the city in sequence.</p>
<p>At the Tianyi Film Company's sports field, the players have been practicing diligently recently. Shao Zuiweng and his younger brother Shao Cunren supervise and guide them on the field every day. The male and female stars surround the field, watching and cheering, which is quite lively. Yesterday was originally scheduled for a friendly match with the Chaozhou Middle School Shanghai Basketball Team, but it was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances. It is said that the final has been rescheduled for next Sunday.</p>
<p>It is heard that the most prestigious Russian film "Storm Over Asia" (Yà Zhōu de Fēng Yún), which was previously banned by the Censorship Board, has now been approved. Therefore, it will be released in the "Shanghai Grand Theatre" again in the near future.</p>
<p>Tianyi Film Company's recent film "The Pursuit" (Zhui Qiu) at the New Guang Theater has received good reviews from various newspapers. The lead actress Li Minghui's expressions still retain the charming, naive, and lively demeanor of the past.

<h3>Film Novel "State Fair" (Diàn Yǐng Xiǎo Shuō Sài Zhēn Huì) (5)</h3>
<p>— Huì Jūn</p>
<p>"So you are an actress, why didn't you tell me earlier?"</p>
<p>Emily's hand slipped into his arm. "I'm starving," she said, "Come on, I know a restaurant."</p>
<p>The next morning, Melissa was surprised by Maggie and Wayne's exuberance. "You two must have had a lot of fun," she said as Wayne was shushing his lips, and Maggie was humming a love song.</p>
<p>Only Abel was missing in the tent. He was anxious because the pig had collapsed and refused to eat. Later, they borrowed a red-headed sow from a neighbor, placed it next to him, and his spirits recovered, and Abel was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Maggie sneaked out to see Pantoff, telling him that she had to accompany her mother to the mincemeat and sauerkraut competition. Pantoff watched Maggie leave and hurriedly lobbied a judge, saying that Mrs. Abel's was the best.</p>
<p>The judge tasted the mincemeat and found Pantoff's words insightful. He clicked his tongue again and again, seemingly reluctant to let other judges share some. His face gradually heated up, and his eyes gradually reddened.</p>
<p>So many prizes made Melissa ecstatic. The sauerkraut won first place. The prize for the mincemeat was a golden needle.</p>
<p>Melissa was almost crying with joy. Maggie helped her back and hesitated for a moment, saying: "I'm going! I'm going to see the excitement for a while. Don't wait for me to come back for dinner! I might eat outside."</p>
<p>"Then, come back early," Melissa instructed. Maggie turned around triumphantly, her fragile heart experiencing a burst of chaotic throbbing. "Pantoff!" she shouted with relief. Pantoff warmly shook her hand and said: "The horse races have started. I spent five dollars to buy a horse spot, and if it wins, we split it in half."</p>
<p>This was simply living like gods! Thus, slowly, the summer night enveloped them. Hand in hand, they left the venue, crossed the small bridge, and walked up the winding path of the small mountain. They sat on the grass under the trees, watching the lights of the venue twinkling and listening to the music drifting.</p>
<p>"Are you happy?" he suddenly asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied simply. "Are you?" (To be continued)</p>
