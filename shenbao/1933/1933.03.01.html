<p>時評</p>
<p>［三］奇恥之回顧與前瞻晦</p>
<p>［女眞］建國之前固常依附中國。稱臣納貢。當時［國家］之界説。不似近世之明悉。而遼東於中國爲郡縣始自秦代。漢之遼陽。亦即今之奉天也。則是東三省之爲中華民國領土。史實具在。誰能妄加否認。即滿清入中國。洵屬異族。但其政治設施。典章文物。仍與漢族無異。僅皇帝之更換。另易一般統治者而已。及至民國成立。統治主權還諸四萬萬國民。二十年來。雖不免有種種糾紛。然皆爲革命過程中必不可免之現象。并不能借詞否定中華民國之主權。尤不能認爲中華民國特有之污點。蓋過渡時期各國亦常有此景象。如法國自一七八九年至於奠定共和。擾攘糾紛埀九十年。我國自民國成立。迄現在！！二十二年之間政治上社會上誠有種種不安。未能即臻治平。吾國民誠多負咎。凡何情於我者亦抱惋惜。但决不能借此割裂我國領土。否定我國主權。蹂躪我國人民。而并蔑視國與國間之［公理］也。</p>
<p>日本包藏禍心。蓄意侵略。殆爲世界所共知徒以我國忙於内爭。未能集中全力於國防。日帝國主義者乃得任意横行。從事於造作僞證。挑動戰亂。由萬寳山案以至中村石本。前者爲日閥嗾令朝鮮農民煽動風潮。而後者則爲軍事密探。偵察我國腹地。乃至發生意外。則借口特殊權益。突於九月十八之夜。出兵襲擊我遼吉兩省。在日本當時提出其所謂五個先决條件。（以特殊！）</p>
<p>侵略所獲之權利爲主）附以生命財産之保障及地方解决等項。迫我作城下之盟。同時更秣馬礪。兵節節進逼产襲龍江。西侵錦義而我國乃依違於和戰之間。空言抵抗。竟至敵人坐大。失地愈廣。而事變乃愈不收拾矣。</p>
<p>由地方關係蔓延至於全國。禍亂相循。中國人民迫於萬不得已。乃採取最和平最合理之報復手段。冀以喚起列國注意。東北三省之被强占。並非地方問題。實爲中國民族整個生存相關。於當世各國亦有至深且切之聯帶關係。故我國對日本帝國主義者所採用之［經濟絕交］手段。乃屬人類所應有。不意日本竟更肆其兇燄。炸毁淞滬。蹂躪閘北之不足。復又乘我國民喘息未定之際。製造傀儡。作兼併東北之計。於是乎日人挾其所謂［亡道。］冒民族自决之名。於三月一日一手建立其所謂滿洲！！僞國矣。　　僞國傀儡之登塲也。世界共知其爲日本軍隊所製造。以遮［掩彼併吞東北三省之惡跡。乃美其辭曰［爲東亞和平。］其實東北三省在日本軍國主義者進攻之前。固相安無事也。而九一八事變以後。［傀儡國］成立。和平之［滿］</p>
<p>洲。］乃始變爲日本之屠塲。烽烟遍野。鷄犬不寗。是則日帝國主義者爲［特殊利益］而用兵。而所謂［和平］全爲不相干之飾詞。也　　其次則爲［防禦赤化］之南侵。此語最足動聽。即老練之英國。於防備蘇聯南窺印度東出中國之餘。亦以爲日本眞有［防赤］之心。且有［討赤］［之力。故年餘以還。皆對日表示好感。助彼鐵蹄縱横。實現其兼併之詭謀。及至榆關被。奪熱河告急。平津亦瀕危殆。英法各國始略知日本之眞意。不在［防備赤化］而在占領土地。不在抵禦赤色勢力之南侵。而在獨占中國市場。借防赤之名。　玩弄世界各國。利用恐怖心理。以遂其侵略之企圖。現在事已大白國聯已於以二月二十四日作堅决否認［僞國申斥日軍之决議矣而我國反能始終］　　受其欺耶。</p>
<p>東北領土主權應歸我有。已無疑義。國聯道德裁制。四十二票對一票可謂盡［公道］之能事。然此不過［國聯戰勝自已。］克服主張和平。與坐視戰爭之矛盾而已。吾人豈能過分希望國聯以實際有效方法。制裁日軍之暴行。且亦不必作此幻想。是故口舌之爭應告終結。鐵血戰爭即當開始。我國被禍慘烈。豈能再持不抵抗主義或局部抵抗主義。以冀必不可得之暫時苟安乎。　　値此傀儡週年之日。我應以鐵拳敲動僞國之喪。鐘發動我國積極奮起之民族鬭爭。立即毅然下令討伐僞國。以赤血洗滌奇恥。以赤血遍洒東北。收復我舊時山河。</p>

<p>本埠徐先孚君來信</p>
<p>在上面，我們已提出許多問題討論，足證中國的現代式的運動的危險性和不宜性。最後我們來解决體育（整個而言）是否能爲中國的出路？這一問題的討論，當然要涉及中國眞的出路怎樣？我們先看中國病的癓結在那裏？是否愚、貧、弱？</p>
<p>最初論弱，我們要問中國人民爲甚知過他們是弱，何處看出？出亡率歟？疾病統計歟？無容説，中國無精密的統計，卽以現在的統計而言，倘是死亡率確是根大的，則此死亡率的統計是否除去戰爭，天災，殺害，瘟役的原因呢？疾病的統計是否多數的材料，抑或除去瘟役而言的呢？在我對於中國人民的弱的問題没有充分的證據使我倡仰之先，一般人之提倡體育以救弱，我也不能盲從。（遇一步的話見前）有人説，日本之强卽在體育盛行，要不知此種言論，猶之乎孟德斯鳩推論英國政治是三匯分立的一樣荒謬。我們知道日本的强，雖非絕對的但多半可靠的是在販夫走卒，青年孩童的手不釋卷。我記得王雲五先生曾對我們説過，他在日本的旅館裏，看見司門的小孩在開啟門扇的時尚目不離書，且所看的不是小説而是智識叢書及歷史地理之類。這些或是題外的話了，不贛。次論貧，中國爲什麽是貧？積極的不能控制自然，卽不能利用自然，缺乏了生産力，而國富少。消極的不能控制社會，如政治失敗和社會失調等，破壞了生産力，而國富减。所以我們要救貧，在先能控制自然和控制社會，而此兩方法的實行，完全關乎國民智識的程度。　倡根結底，我們中國的出路終在救愚。</p>
<p>末了，我們的救愚又怎樣呢？法西斯以國家有機説爲根據，它以爲人民若各組織各器官的細胞，　是生理學的立塲。我却有民族有機説，而站在生物學的立塲（其實孫中山先生的民族主義卽在此，世人不察罷了）。因爲現在人民的生存是繼續其祖先的生長的；生殖是生命的繼續，生活是生命的發展。所以人民的責任一方面是維持遺傳的性質，一方面發揚進化的機能。這種説法以宇宙物理解釋，前者是向心力，後者是離心力，同時具有這兩種力，宇宙才能運行，才有組織。一樣我們需要這兩種力量才能濟救我們民族的病源！愚。至於我們民族維持遺傳的性質是怎樣呢？固有的道德和固有的學問早已　墜無遺，這早有人説過，也不必多講。我們民族的發揚進化的機能又如何呢？近代學西洋文明，如練陸軍，其結果是望外侮而後却，赴内戰如就義，分離國土，衰淪國勢。如辦學堂、其結果是造出一批批的新式官僚和新式少爺。如學體育、……如此情形何至而不可亡國。但是這並非我的反對西洋文明，我却在反對中國專學西洋文明的皮毛，而不知取西洋文明的精髓。學皮毛，結果是［部戰學步，匍匐而回一。何况我國已是時代落伍者，宜如何以最經濟的辦法，遵最迅捷的途徑，取得了現代文明的眞髓，趕上了時代的前驅。</p>
<p>現代西洋文明的眞髓何在？</p>
<p>一是供給的力量，一是支配的力量。所謂供給的力量，是發明人們智識和技術，控制了自然，爲人類進化的原料的生産，這就是物的科學。所謂支配的力量，是指導人們智識和技術應用的方向，控制了社會，爲人類進化　成貨的管理，這就是人的科學。於是乎我們要取得西洋文明的眞髓必須下一番實地的功夫去苦學與深思，用不到虚浮誇張與狂熱，果然，中國的出路捷徑也就在此。</p>
<p>如果有人家説，西洋文明的眞髓即在體育，那麽我將無言。從前孟德斯鳩對於英國政治的鉛覺，反而奠下現代德模克拉西的基礎；郢書燕解，郢生的［　燭］，且能喚起燕昭王的求賢。或許體育，未始非中國的興盛之途，那國人們不妨奮起，用全副的精神，集全民的力量來提體育，實施體育。但不知先生的意見如何？</p>

<h3 id="c127">［阿Ｑ相］ <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>想來讀過［阿Ｑ正傳］的人永遠不能忘記阿Ｑ的思想意識罷？［阿Ｑ正傳］的精髓就在這種［阿Ｑ相］的有力的揭發。</p>
<p>［阿Ｑ相］的要點，約可撮舉如下：</p>
<p>事實上失敗或屈伏的時候，便有［精神上的勝利］聊自安慰，於是［反敗爲勝］</p>
<p>，睡覺也酣甜了。阿Ｑ的名言，所謂［被兒子打］，所謂［我的祖宗比你强］，就是他［精神勝利］的哲學。</p>
<p>趙木爺或趙秀才的大棍子打將來時，照例是不敢抵抗：假洋人的小手杕打將２</p>
<p>來時，也是無抵抗：但在阿Ｑ視爲平號或低一輩的王鬍小Ｄ之類像朋友似的走近阿Ｑ阿的時候，阿Ｑ便要拿身份，甚至想建立他的威權了，雖然結果常常只有［精神的勝利］，可是阿Ｑ的［壯志］永遠不會銷沉。</p>
<p>这便是所謂［阿Ｑ相］，也就是數千年來身受堯舜禹湯文武孔孟嫡傳敎育的中華大多數國民的普遍相！</p>
<p>［阿Ｑ正傳］出世以後，阿Ｑ相］很受人譏笑了；但是譏笑儘管譏笑，阿Ｑ　］</p>
<p>相］依然流露在芸芸大千的社會現象中。特别在［九一八］國難以後，［阿Ｑ相］</p>
<p>的［精神勝利］和［不抵抗］總算發揮得淋漓盡致了。</p>
<p>那麽［阿Ｑ相］也可以説是中國民族的民族性罷？此又未必然！因爲同是黄臉孔的中國人不盡是那樣乏。不見東北義勇軍過去一年來的浴血苦戰麽？這原因大概就在那些投身義勇軍的東北老百姓們没有受過堯舜禹湯文武周孔嫡傳的心法。</p>
<p>在這一點上，［阿Ｑ相］的别名也就可以稱爲［聖賣相］或［大人相］。</p>

<p>朱丹我有件秘密事情要告訴你。我愛上了一個很高尚的女人，我很想你幫助我一下，替我冩一張小條子，以便抛在她的跟前。</p>
<p>敎授　很好！</p>
<p>朱丹　那一定冩得很漂亮吧？、</p>
<p>敎授　當然。你希望用詩寫給她嗎？朱丹　不要，不要；不要詩。</p>
<p>敎授　你想只用散文寫嗎？</p>
<p>朱丹　不要散文，也不要詩。</p>
<p>敎授　那不用散文，就得用詩呀。</p>
<p>朱丹　爲什麽這樣？</p>
<p>敎授　因爲一個人想表現自已只限於用　　散文或是詩。</p>
<p>朱丹　除了散文和詩之外，就没有别的東西了麽？</p>
<p>敎授　没有。一切不是散文的東西便是詩，不是詩的東西便是散文。</p>
<p>朱丹　那末？我們説話的時候，用的是什麽呢？</p>
<p>敎授　散文。</p>
<p>朱丹　什麽？我説：妮哥兒，拿我的拖鞋來，拿我的睡帽給我，那也是散文嗎？</p>
<p>敎授　正是。</p>
<p>朱丹　乖乖，我説了四十多年的散文，我自已還不知道呢。</p>

<p>— 曹如蕙女士</p>
<p>昨夜他做了一個夢。直到現在，那迷離恍惚的夢境，如薄紗，如輕霧，隱隱約約的，仍在他眼前浮動。　夢境是這樣的：</p>
<p>不知在什麽時候，他的脅下忽然長出了一對金色的翼，很大，有若［垂天之］雲］。鼓動雙翼，他便極自然的從地下昇起，在大際，在雲端，俯瞰大他很迅速地在他下面旋轉，使他眩昏，使他驚懼，終於他止住在一應萬仭的高山上。　　山是在雲端，在天際，在不可想像的幻境。他，便傲然的駐立在山巓。</p>
<p>看呀，他是怎樣的崇高！薄紗一般的輕霧籠罩着他的四週，一片彩雲飄浮在他的頂上，日月向他扮笑臉，星子向他閃明眸。他偶然俯瞰，海洋唱出清妙的隊，在他的足前朝拜；那更小的只是如螞蟻，如塵埃，細微渺小，他偶而歡笑，牠們便都應和着他歡笑，他偶而發怒，牠們便都恐怖，戰慄。眞的，他是站在一切之上，誰知道幾千百萬億塵埃的累積，才得作成這君臨一切的高山？　於是他高歌，他舞蹈，好像勝利是永屬於他，光榮也永屬於他。他鄙夷一切，傲視一切，陵轢一切，他以爲一切都是渺小的，庸三碌的，只有他是崇高的，偉大的。他傲慢地用着鄙夷的眼光向四週投擲。</p>
<p>日子過得很快，但也很慢，他中人是繼續地歡笑，舞蹈，高歌！</p>
<p>有一天，忽然他的脚下發出了悲壯而宏喨的歌聲，是從地下層發出來的，是千萬人的合唱，那歌詞是：</p>
<p>［我們是塵埃，我們是塵埃，］</p>
<p>我們創造出了宇宙和世界，就是這高山！！這巍峨的寳座，也是由我們的血肉累積起來。你看，那小子，那惡麽，安坐山巓多暢快！</p>
<p>我們便永在他的寳座下把日子挨。兄弟們，這日子再不能挨，齊動手，把那小子摜下來，我們要做一粒自由平等的塵埃！</p>
<p>我們要創造出自由平等的世界！］　　就在這悲壯的歌聲中，他的脚下發生了劇烈的震動，如天要崩，地要裂，火山要爆發。他隨着這劇烈的震動，顚播，昏眩。立即，他震怒，他高呼；　　［静止，不要鬧，畜生們！］</p>
<p>但這叱聲反使歌聲更宏喨，震動更劇烈，終於山崩了，和一匹死狗一樣，他從山巓滾下來。在他的最後的一息，他還極清晰地聽得那宏喨的歌聲；　　［我們要做一粒自由平等的塵埃，］　　我們要創造出自由平等的世界！］昨夜他就做了一個這樣的夢。</p>

<p>— 陽秋</p>
<p>上月爲了指責某無聯刊物上的兩閲所謂［詞］，我曾隨便冩了一篇［讀詞的解放運］動專號後恭感］一文投在自由談上發表。最近朋友告訴我説：該無聊刊物上已有［陽春］其人者署文爲曾某辯護，大意是説我並没有指出曾某的所謂［詞］的缺點，而且曾某的詞［曾得許多的體育來　贊譽，將成爲不朽之作］，　時並隱約地指我爲［流氓］，爲［紈袴子。］我覺得［陽春］實在太蠢了，簡直蠢得可憐。（曾某似）乎聰明些）現在我請再將曾某的［詞］（？）恭錄一次，並將我對曾詞的批評重抄如下，讓［陽春］再看個明白。</p>
<p>畫堂春</p>
<p>一年開始日初長，客來慰我凄凉。偶然消遺本無妨，打打麻將。都喝干杯中酒，國家事管他娘。樽前猶辛有紅妝，但不能狂下算子</p>
<p>鶇　北正嚴寒，不比江南暖；僞國居然見太平，何似中原亂？</p>
<p>［全會］亦曾開，救國成懸案；出席諸公盡得官，國難無人管。</p>
<p>上面所抄的便是曾某的詞，我的批評則是：人家時長日也長，自該［消遺］［打麻將；］人家　前有［紅妝］，管他［　狂］［不能狂］？［時代］［新］了我守舊，管他娘呢［管他娘］！　善我人者固不必聲色俱厲，只要冷笑一聲，也就夠有羞恥心的人受了，陽春，你何必一定要逼得我盡詞暴露，使曾某難堪呢？</p>
<p>老實告訴你：在意識上這兩閲［詞］是活畫出了曾某是一個［小白臉文化］的代表者，！！不，只是一個假薄兒，一個色情狂的墮落青年。你看，在廢歷新年中，山海關止爲日軍攻陷，東北義勇軍正在冰天雪地和帝國主義者苦鬥，而我們的自命爲［作家］的曾某，却感覺得日子太［長］了，生活大［凑凉］（！）了，只有設法［消遺］，幸而［客來］，四脚凑足，便［打打麻］將］，打麻將之淡足，還要［喝酒］，酒酣興濃，於是便高喊：［國家事管他娘］。高喊旣畢，一眼看見同席的還有［紅妝］在，（按卽女人也禁不住色然以喜，心怦怦動，恨不得卽時［狂］一［狂］，但也許是因爲有人在旁邊礙手礙脚，所以終於不能狂］，於是曾某便不勝感喟抱恨之。你看，在這短短的四十七字中，是不是有一個不識不知的小白臉！！不，一個色情狂的浪子的醜態在裏面活　着？是不是有一個最下流的輕薄少年的面影在裏面活躍着？其次，在卜算子的前半闋中［僞國居然見太平，何似］中原亂一兩句，除了發無聊的牢騷外，同時更一手抹盡了日本帝國主義者在東北的暴行，以及東北義勇軍反帝國主義的英勇的門爭，正式承認日帝國主義者奪取我東北是絕對的應該，是誠何居心？陽春，僞國果然是［太平了嗎？我勸你趕快追隨曾某去僞國做［溥儀聖天子統］治下的順民罷！並且這也才是你和曾某最適當的出路！</p>
<p>再説吧，在技巧上，曾某的詞］更是［不知所云］，對於詞，我固然反對刻意雕琢，反對　巧，但所謂［打打麻將］，國家事管他娘，究竟成不成話？詞是這樣［解放的嗎？牛溲馬］勃，都稱爲詞］，而且還居然刊印出來，居然説這是［解放了的詞］，我們如果不願這一有毒質的東西］去傷害一般無辜的青年，如果不願文壇上有［紈袴子搗亂，給他一點點敎訓不是應該的嗎？</p>
<p>末了，我還得誠懇地勸告陽春，把腦子沉静一下，同時也勸曾某認清時代，認清自已，從現在起，多讀點書，多做點有意義的事，少吹牛皮，少寫些肉麻的詩詞。言盡於此，以後如嘵嘵不已，恕不再覆，以免糟塌自由談寳貴的篇幅及我自已的寳貴的時間·</p>

<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>這時候，她對於老人們，覺得十分幻滅了；因此離開了他，在她是高高興的。她繼續前進，直走到路邊蔭帶的河岸；她在這地方見到了她同種的黑人五十個，他們顯然是人家所雇用，充當脚失的，正在坐着用膳，和一羣白人的先生和女士隔開開了相當的路。那些女士穿着短褲，戴着軟木帽，黑女孩子便知道他們是探險家，同男的一樣。他們剛　　　了　東西。其中有的打盹，有的在雜記薄上寫。</p>
<p>［這是什麽探險團啦？］黑女孩子向挑夫們的領袖説。</p>
<p>［這呌作好奇者旅行團］他回答。</p>
<p>［他們是好的白人呢，還是壞的白人？］她問。</p>
<p>［他們是胡調的人們，他們不惜工夫吵鬧着，爲的是一些小事情，］他説。［他們問着問題］</p>
<p>，爲的就是問着問題。］</p>
<p>［咦！你幹麽，］女士中間之一呌着説。［你顧自去；不許停在這地方。你要惹得男人們心］</p>
<p>亂的。］</p>
<p>［你也一樣，］黑女孩子説。</p>
<p>［啐，女孩子，］那女士説。［我五十歲了］。我是無性者。他們對我很熟了。你呢，還是走開罷。］</p>
<p>［你用不着擔心的：他們不是白人啦，］黑女孩子用了頗有些輕蔑的口吻説·［你們爲什麽自稱爲好奇者旅行團的？你們對什麽有好奇心呢？是對神有好奇心麽？</p>
<p>這番話引起了這麽暢快的一陣笑聲，竟使那些打着盹的人們醒過來，要别人將那笑話重説給他們聽。</p>
<p>［文明國的人們還是在好幾百年以前，纔對於這問題有什麽好奇心，］先生們之一説。［還是在十五世紀以前罷，我想，］另一個人説。莎士比亞就是十足的無神思想者。］</p>
<p>［莎士比亞不能算是一切人，］第三個人説。［國歌是十八世紀的作品。你看，這裏面我們］</p>
<p>使喚着神做我們骯髒的政治工作哩。］</p>
<p>［那個神是不同的，］那第二個先生説。［在中世紀，神是大家認爲使喚我們，。敎我們不住］</p>
<p>地工作的。待到資産階級興起了，封建貴族階級將向來是他們的特權的代價的義務呹翻了，人們就得到新的神了，這新的神由上層階級使喚着，敎他不住地地工作。［破壞他們的政治罷］</p>
<p>；阻撓他們的奸謀罷一做這樣，做那樣。］</p>
<p>［是呵，］那第一個先生説；［而且，還有第三個，小資産階級的神呢，他的職務就是，當］</p>
<p>他們使記錄着人間善惡的天使那本册子上，記滿了一星期中他們生意上的欺詐的時候，他得在星期日用他的血將那本册子揩個乾净。］</p>
<p>［這兩個神現在都還在得勢的時候］，第三個先生廍。［如果這你的些疑惑呢，那麽，給］</p>
<p>國歌的第二節換一節合宜的試試看；或者將禱告書上的贖罪篇删掉試試卷［］。</p>

<p>理想的鄉村敎育（中）徐征吉三、扶助設置農業産品合作社近年來直接間接受到資本家的盤剥的、要算到是鄉民了、商人加以的剥削也無所不用其極、所以［農村經濟］破産］的現象、便一發而不收拾、我們説［致　萬能、］他們説［敎育萬惡、］敎育界有不少經費的來源、要靠着農民們的血汗、我們激於同情心也應該給他們一個有力量的臂　、［農業産品］合作社］便是使他們脱離商人壟斷市塲、剥削農民的一個好方法、不過他們不懂得合作社的意羲和組織、鄉村學校的敎員們、應該宣傳、宣傳合作社的利益、江蘇建設廳對於合作社事業、很爲熱心、并於各縣設立合作社指導員專行辦理指導農民合作事業這誠然是一個好現象、以目前經濟破産　農村、而得到這一個有力量的帮助、未始非農村恢復經濟之一助呢、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>假定世界是一廣大無限的園地，建立在上面的大小算國，彷彿　界而種的名化奇草，在色彩上，香味上，姿態上，各有各的特性和優點。花畦，便是它們的領上，付籬，便是它們的國防綫；只須，花與花，草與草，互相尊重着領土完全，而不衝破其他的國防綫；那麽，世界的和平之園，當然不會發生什麽不幸的戰爭了。</p>
<p>要維持這座和平之園，萬萬不可使裏面有滋在蔓草的可能性；［蔓，難圖也，］這句古話，是説抱有野心的人和蔓草一般可怖；現在，人人痛恨，野心國，不是世界之　麽？到南滿，没有人把它刈去，又蔓延到中滿了，北滿了；近更愛在加厲，萬延到榆關了，到熱邊了。這是，任着它蔓延不絕，它會蔓延到中華全土，當然也會蔓延到寰球各國。那麽，我所説的和平之園，不要都化做了一片蔓草麽？</p>
<p>國聯大會四十二票對一票通過十九國特委會報告書，宛比握了一柄公理之刀，在强權之上刈了一下；但是，僅僅一刈，它的惡恨依舊存在，將來舊根重萌，或者比着未刈以前，益發滋生的快，也未可知；這便如何處置呢？</p>
<p>刈了蔓草，第二步便當把它的惡根没法除去。左傳上説；［絕其本根］，勿使能殖，則善者伸矣；］但是，四十二國　力量，不過適用一刈字，而談不到絕其本根，爲什麽呢？四十二的號　寫法，恰是一個刈字；吾想，四十一國對於世界之蔓、除却一刈以外，怕没有其他的有效方法吧。</p>

<p>— 思素</p>
<p>在暴日侵略聲中，傀儡兩個字忽應運而生，全國大小報紙，幾乎每日都少不了它。就傀儡兩字的本身而言，是算得意呢，還是失意？倒也領値得研究。本來，傀儡這兩字，大家都作爲木偶戲的代名詞，並無搬上報紙的資格。木偶戲便是提線戲，上海倒也有幾家專演，呌做什麽聲舞台新舞台，在各大報的海上游藝一覽表中，可以找到。它不比天蟾三星等等有著名藝員，花錢看了戲，可以撰，篇劇評，搬上報紙；看了提線戲，誰高興去評它呢？就是評起來，也没有登載的價値。所以在九一八以前，要在報紙上尋傀儡，那眞是談何容易；九一八以後，突然應運　生，報不絕載，這在傀儡本身，總不能不算是出風頭的時期，要洋洋大得其意罷！然而不然，傀儡本身如果有知的詁，絕不會得意；除非傀儡已經數典忘了祖，纔會把這片時的熱鬧，覥顏引爲得意呢！因爲傀儡之祖，曾幹過［存漢退夷］的光榮勞績，樂府雜錄上説；漢高祖在平城爲冒頓所圍，其城一面即冒頓妻闕氏，兵强三面，壘中絕食，陳平訪知閼氏妬忌，即造木偶人運機關，舞於陴間，　氏慮下其城，冒頓必納妓女，遂退軍；後樂家翻爲戲具，即傀儡也。休看輕了傀儡，它能解平城之圍，保全漢室大下。今之傀儡，却竟反其道而行，爲敵之倀，割裂漢土，它是出於甘願的嗎？只怕未必，傀儡還是那麽個傀儡；不過造之者却非陳平，而爲鄭孝胥熙洽張海鵬之流，傀儡之爲用便與陳平所造者相反罷了！或者傀儡已明白眼前的熱鬧不過片時，稍停便要收拾起來，不再見於報紙；反陳平之流却還在睡夢裏，誤以爲歡娛能延長下去呢！</p>

<p>— 闔重樓</p>
<p>是創造的時期</p>
<p>青春　草色、活躍的春天，象微着人們少壯的時期。如果認爲［春］是一年之計，那麽［青春］就是人們一生之計了。</p>
<p>［花落可重開，青春不再來。］這是一般青年担憂自已的青春易逝所發生的感想，因爲有了這種感想，便很容易走到縱慾的路上去，結果反會自已的青春更急促的滅亡！</p>
<p>一個人要善用他的青春，因爲青春雖然最短却最有力，我們要知道［讚美］或［悲嘆］都是不認識青春本身的價値；只有舉起萬以的雙手，把握住時代，創造些偉大的事業來，那才不至於辜負了寳貴的青春呢。</p>
<p>朋友們：不要猶豫，肩起各人的責任，努力向前幹吧！</p>

<p>— 廢名</p>
<p>上海不愧爲具有可怕的誘惑力的神秘之都，只要你到處留神，你會從任何地方發見你見所未見聞所未聞的情景，你會由此理悟到人生，社會乃至世界的一切。理髮館也者，就是一向每易爲人忽略胆實充滿着豐富的感歎資料的處所。</p>
<p>眞的，上海的理髮館是可以趕上世界許多大都會的理髮館。在莫斯科，東京等有名的都會中的理髮館，不講别的，只就設備與招待方面來説，已有瞠乎其後之概。</p>
<p>自然，上海亦有種種等級不同的理髮館。拿我個人來説，從一毛錢到一元大洋的理髮館我都巡禮觀光過；有時候我會感覺到便宜的理髮館甚至此闊氣的理髮館更能得到一種意外的滿足。</p>
<p>然卯憑良心來説，我還是願意進比較不推扳的理髮館裏去，理由是一言難盡的。</p>
<p>那大星期日黄昏的時候，與其説是爲了理髮毌寗説是要找點寫小品文的資料我闖進了霞飛路的個一等理髮廳。</p>
<p>在放送了一股甜辣的香水氣味的開門中我由侍者導上了樓，出乎意料之外，樓上只有我一個人。</p>
<p>從没有帶口罩的理髮師的嘴裏噴出了一股酒臭，開始感覺到討厭的失望。波矮］送過了一霍小報，我糊亂聞了一陣。就在這個時候隨着樓弼上掀鈴的響聲，湧上了一陣高跟皮鞋的脚步聲，從壁鏡裏面看見了三位閃着笑渦的摩登佳人，由侍者引上了座位，於是室内的香寗更加農重起來了。</p>
<p>許是因爲在座的顧客中只有我一個人是異性吧，我感覺到一種無　的快樂。爲了好奇心的驅策，很冷静地從鏡裏面觀察三位摩登佳人的面部表情，同時留神傾聽着伊們的笑語，才卑到了伊們是要去參加募捐援助義勇軍的游藝會的舞星。</p>
<p>又是一陣不快意的掀欽聲引上了一兩個帶有醉意的肥碩的乂國下級軍官，他們瞥見了三位中國摩登佳人，露出了一種不平凡的笑臉，從他們的對語中，彷彿聽見了一句：［帶着西洋風味的中國女子］。我默默在想：爲什麽一般西洋人對中國女子的想像還是擺脱不了小脚的影子呢。</p>
<p>鏡子裏面漸漸映出了烏黑的頭髮在波動着，在另一面鏡子裏却映出了兩對斜覻着右邊的很生疏的綠色醉眼。我的過敏的神經似乎唯恐鄰座的女同胞爲意外的不幸所襲擊，情願坐在當中爲他們的屏障。</p>
<p>剌耳的吹着乂國調子的呼嘯聲開始尖鋭化起來了。我忽然看見胸前披着的白布上有幾根頭髮拼成了一個［女］字。</p>
<p>在回家的途中我純潔地在爲三涕髮的姑娘們暗暗祝福！</p>

<p>描寫戲劇裏的角色容易，描寫社會上現實的角色　；因爲戲劇　的角色　是特别誇張了的，特點容易看得出，社會上現實的角色的特點則不容易給你看見。</p>
<p>描寫西洋人館　性易，描寫中國人的個性難，因爲西洋人常常能顯現他們自已的個性，而中國人則以把自已的個性汩化人一般的普通性中爲一種道德。</p>
<p>描寫中國的無知識階級人物比較描寫知識階級的人物容易，因爲在中國　是知識階級的人物起是善於隱藏他們的自我，越是近乎冷冰冰的東西。（其實冷冰冰的人物不一定都是有知）識的，有許多是故意　成喜怒不形於色的冷冰冰樣子以自示其爲士君子之流。）</p>
<p>假如你能注意到十個人所習用的語法，你便可以發見上種不同的言語習慣，不　音調，詞，語的用法不同，卽組織法亦有他們的個性。地方環境和敎育程度大約是比較重要的原因。　　人人都不免會有肉麻的思想，不過較爲［高雅］的人則會運用其較爲［　　］的言語文字來發表；較爲鄙俗］的人則只會運用其較爲［鄙俗］的言語和行爲而已。</p>

<p>在上海的人，多數是聰明人，卽使本來不很聰明的，耳濡目染，日子久了也就變得聰過了。不過我不知道這一個欵式的聰明人對於國家社會有什麽益處。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>祖父「我們不回去了！你快把橋拆毀了吧」的確，依這時候的情形看來，如其沒有人肯犧牲著生命，在隔河抵擋倭子，那一座木橋便永遠沒機會拆毀；木橋不毀，田家莊便立刻有給倭子們踏爲平地的可能。因此，小鈴在殺過橋來的時候，便不預備回去了。</p>
<p>田莊主也知道這一座橋的重要，而他兩個小孫子的犧牲，更極明顯地已是一件不可避免的事實了。於是在他閉上眸子，縱馬過橋之後，便毅然決然的吩咐，伏在小裏的老五，立即劈毀了木橋</p>
<p>同時倭子已分成兩堆，像包　　　似的把小禾小鈴圍困住了。</p>
<p>隔著河，老人挺直了腰肢，像僵屍似的兀坐在馬上，眼眶盡量的擴大著，差不多就要直了裂開來了；臉上的水，在黯淡的暮色裏，閃出亮晶晶的光業，誰也不知道那是汗水；還是淚水；還有那兩條握著刀劍，殺人如麻的鐵腕，竟也不能遏止的在索索地抖著。</p>
<p>倭子暫時是不作沖進河來的準備了，決計先解決這兩個把死爲殺人的代價的小烈士。一片擾攘的殺聲，震動了原野。最初這邊的人還隱約可以看見在倭子的重圍裏，有兩個像車輪一般東西，不住的在委活躍地滾著，升衝著，撞著；有時還可以聽見倭子們中了槍後的哀號聲，和小鈴小禾所發出來的悲壯熱烈的狂吼聲······。漸漸地，倭子的殺聲罩過了一切，樹林一般的刀陣也不見晃動了。</p>
<p>夜風行過柳林，發出猿啼一般的長嘯來，仿佛是在向那個至死不屈的小勇士致哀悼。</p>
<p>「啊！父親！我們不能這樣坐視不救啊！」田家將中所僅剩的一個不曾受傷的老五，不能忍耐地用一種沙啞的喉音，向田莊主請不求著。主張大家再衝過河去搭救小鈴他們回來。</p>
<p>「不能！不能！不能！」田莊主竭力握住了一顆正在狂劇跳著的心，忍住了一切的痛苦，從牙縫裏迸出極堅決的答復來。（七）</p>

<p>所謂非常時期徒令社會不安</p>
<p>倒閣運動猛烈但爲軍部支配</p>
<p>日本帝國的命運如何、就是每天在那裏張牙舞爪兼併滿洲進攻熱河固爭南洋的薩長兩閥也自已算不清、不過他們都覺得目前的局勢、非常危險、所以只好採取軍事的冒險政策、希圖以對外軍事行動作烟幕來掩飾牠國内的醜惡現狀、東京市瓦斯受賄案、右傾各團體的暴動計劃、左傾思想的繁榮滋長……都是以一不景氣作背景、這纔釀成了所謂非常時期、原來非常時期的解釋、該是戰爭的時期、日本旣不承認以武力侵略、表面上又没有對我們中國正式宣戰、又那能説是［非常］呢不過我們試察日本國内的情勢、—特别是去年五月十五日犬養毅氏在首相任内、爲陸海軍現役軍官剌殺之後、般社會的不安的確有戰時意味、何况事實上對中國的東北三省、天天有小規模的戰爭、對熱河、對　東、以至於太平洋方面、都竭力準備大規模的戰爭、而今年度的預算陸海軍費、竟達八億二千萬日金、占全國庫支出的百分之三十六又五、二十二億三千九百萬日金、其爲準戰時預算支出、毫無疑義、通日本的國民、没有人不懷着戰神降臨的恐懼、雖然、軍部方面倡出種種高調、同時壓迫言論、（於法律取締之外、再加以在鄉軍人會等類御用團體作脅制輿論的中心勢力、隨便就加以不忠君不愛國惡名、而予以殘害、）所以［非戰］的意識在民間縱然很濃厚、却爲軍部的主戰論遮着了、</p>
<p>齋藤實的［非常時期］内閣、許多人都以爲的任務、該是克服日本當前的危難、渡脱國内一般社會的不安、并且要使侵略中國運動告一段落、於是乎就可以説是渡過了非常時期而進入於平常狀態可是誰都明白、日本社會的不安、是跟着資本主義的經濟恐慌展開而展開的、日本豈能超出資本主義的範圍、另自鑄成一個世界、侵略範圍愈擴大、日本的困難愈多、用兵越多、財政問題越難解决、因用兵而惹起國除的暗雲、也就越是濃厚、例如此次國際聯盟十九委員會之提出勸告案、日本在外交上陷於孤立地位、軍部方面的策略、訓主張更加緊侵略、擴大戰爭的範園、由奉天到熱河東、試看國聯將如之何、美國其奈牠何、中國似乎更不在　眼裏、所以只用兩師團多兵、就想安然占領熱河、</p>
<p>因此齋藤内閣越要渡過非常時期、而非常時期且愈嚴重、社會不安增加、而對外戰爭更急可是牠政治上的矛盾反而展開、各派間的倒閣運動、依然很猛烈、第一是軍部預政策、第二是政友會想組織政黨内閣、第三是民政黨流的擁宇垣運動、</p>
<p>軍部的　預政策、誠然嫌現内閣手腕太軟弱、但是齋藤爲［好好先生］、不很大拿出自已的主意、對各部大臣、都能讓他們去盡量自由發展、對於目空一切的陸軍、當然更没有問題、而且齋藤實又是海軍耆宿、所以在陸軍方面、還没有積極對他不滿的表示、不過國民同盟一般人、很想接近政權、乃極力和陸軍閥位攏、準備擁護荒木派所屬意的平沼麒一郎組閣、但是國聯問題發生、牠政治的困難更多、恐怕這是不易實現的事、何况法西斯内閣、也不爲金融資本和地主們所擁護、至於内田康哉挾軍部而登台、那是可能性更少了、</p>
<p>政友會據有絕對多數議席、照議會政治的常理而論、該拜大命組閣、但是所謂非常時期、憲法旦在軍部鐵蹄之下、遑論［憲政常道］現内閣　齋藤非但不曾克服其所謂非常時期、而且戰機還更緊迫懦弱無能爲人民所厭棄的政友會、焉叆透過軍部、制服民政黨、國民同盟而支配政權、何况（政友會本身）床次（竹二郎）系和久原（房之助）系互相對立、并不受鈴木總裁的統轄、則是牠組閣的可能自必减少了</p>
<p>民政黨擁立宇垣一成、是很巧妙的策略、旣可以借　抵制荒木、又可以防止軍部獨裁、而且字垣也能夠在軍人當中得到不少的同情、對上層的元老、頗有好感、但是少壯的荒木派、必定强烈的加以反對、特别正在要向熱河用兵的時候、宇垣豈能挿足、然則民政黨的政策雖巧、恐怕實際上没有什麽效用的、</p>
<p>論目前政情、齋藤内閣動摇是有的、可是比政友會的鈴木、和軍部　默契的平沼都更適當、比之宇垣還多一重調和性、所以齋藤内閣在各派對立外交緊急的現在、還未必就倒台、不過加度改組、變成軍部影響之下的［强力］内閣、其可能性確非常之大、否則就會成立純粹的軍事内閣、無論誰出面（是内田是沼是其）他的人）組閣、都無大關係、事實上須完全受軍部的支配、纔足以應付目前局面、實行軍部所主張的侵略政策、（二月二十）日）</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>據昨天某夜報所載，紐約時報北平電訊云，［業已休退之日本皇軍陸軍少］將坂西、告紐約時報訪員、以滿洲人民對於［滿洲國］之態度，渠信現今［滿洲國］自負之領土，至末最多僅能代表曾暫時的有過一國徽的有過一國徽的國家而已，渠之意見，雖與日本軍部及外務省者完全不同，惟决信及至最後日本必退還滿洲與中國，其理由是［滿洲國雖擁有三千萬人民，但非眞正純粹之滿洲人，］而［實皆僅華人，］故［俟中國各省入於靖平有秩序之時期時，渠等自將其個人及所有之土］地，依自然的定律及需要而歸還中國。］（以上所引皆原文）</p>
<p>中國眞是叨天之幸，人失去的土地，竟有依［自然定律］歸還的［意想不到的奇效］，而這話出於［日本皇軍陸軍少將］之口，尤深覺珍貴，足使［全靠天命］的［將軍們聞而色喜］，且静待［最後］的［歸還］吧！即使不幸而不及目覩，那只能怪自已壽命的不濟，不能怨時期太長。</p>
<p>最後我應該感謝的，是昨夜讀了這節新聞，把往常的過慮全丢而得一個好睡，其效力眞不下於［安神藥片，］我想從今以後總可睡得安穩些，——即使做起温柔的春夢來也長些，於此我不能不感謝這位［留華數十年］，［身穿］</p>
<p>華服］，［能操極純粹之華語的溥儀的］［熟友］，固不獨一般主倡運命論的將軍們所引爲知已而感激涕零而已！</p>
<p>［現今］［滿洲國］自負之領土，至末最多僅能代表曾暫時的有過一國徽的國家而已］，這話，我可以賭咒，我是極端相信的，——這是［自然的定律］。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>甘肅舊友鄧君來函，附有雪後以煤炭贈華林山難民五古一首，語甚悲慘，照錄如下，</p>
<p>哀哀古抱罕，顏年苦乾暵，那堪菜色民，又値花門亂，村落倐成墟，妻子盡離散，行者窮途哭，居者析骸釁，所幸大府賢，華林儼授館，薄粥能續命，勝似醒　灌，造物胡不仁，氣候忽變換，飛雪侵冷床，尖風破紙幔，嗟我難中人，短衣不至骭，兒女啼且號，何以度宵旰，敢與饑寒爭，恐將生死判，感此不成眠，中夜起三歎，代謀一夕安，先贈一挺炭，並求慈善家，博施發宏願，常識蒸汽鍋的保護法奴</p>
<p>自從正泰第一橡膠廠鍋爐爆發，死傷工人二百餘，這個消息傳佈後，全滬震驚，地方當局也以事關人民安全，嚴格地注意他，記者以爲旣往不諫，來者可追，祇望以後辦實業工廠的人，不要貪圖近利，草菅人命，應準備充分工業智識，免得再鬧出這樣重大亂子來，已是不幸中之幸了。茲將蒸氣鍋的保護法，述之如次，以供參考。</p>
<p>保護鍋爐的方法，和保護人體一樣，第一要清潔，使水中所含的礦物質，不要停頓在鍋爐内，以致四周結成塊層，减少鐵的傳熱力量，所以一面要將所用的水濾過，一面將鍋爐内部，每星期揩洗一次，就是烟囱，也要隨時打掃。　　除了清潔之外，第二件重要的事情，是注意水汀度數，譬如可燒一百零五度的爐子，冷水磅爲五十磅，所燒水汀祇有七十度，至九十度，這樣很爲適當，假如燒至一百二十度或一百十五度，而壓氣凡而，也在一百二十度，這時便有絕大危險，猶如祇有百斤重担可挑的人，呌他去負百五十斤的重量，那有不顚覆的道理？所以我們要十分注意，督促火夫，隨時去察看保險凡而。</p>
<p>其他還要注意水表，若水表内的水有一寸多高，我們開他第三只凡而，有氣和水噴出，便可證明這鍋内有相當的水，如以手向噴出之口承之，祇有汽而無水，這是鍋内的水將完的朕兆，這時若不减低火力，灌入定量的水，鍋底的鐵板羅絲，必先被熔堕下，甚至鍋爐爆炸。</p>
<p>有時通至水表的小汽管，管端小孔，被水中污物汙塞，致水表失其效用，往往開凡而噴出來無水，而鍋中仍有水，或噴出來時有水，而鍋中已乾涸，不可不注意。</p>
<p>一座鍋爐，最多祇有十年可用，到了一定時期，好的爐子，表面上雖看不出什麽病態，然而他的物質上，實已失其效用，一般貪近利的人，對於這種殘器，還是蔽帚可珍的不肯捨棄，終至仍蹈貪小失大的覆轍。後悔莫及了。</p>
<p>總之，工人貪懶，不肯盡心地去服務，實業家貪利，無暇顧及安全問題，結果勞資兩受其害，所以要防止這種禍害，地方政府應有毅力—不可以一紙公文，便算了案—去監督資方，不許他們因陋就簡，資方應有充分工業智識，去監督工人，不許他們因循苟且，這樣工業才有進步的希望，人類安全，亦有相當的保障，不知道我的主張，可爲事實所許，通行無阻嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c255">航空救國 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>這幾天在國難臨頭的中國，最時髦的一個口號，莫如航空救國了。鬧得一片飛機聲，你也來一個乂乂號，我也來個乂乂號，在不久的將來中國自必要平添了不少的飛機呢！</p>
<p>在中國，大鬧航空救國的當兒，日本也正在呼着擴展空軍的口號，在積極的購買飛機訓練航空人材。因爲據日本人自已説，眼前日本所有的飛機，還不夠自衛呢！</p>
<p>有一位日本人説得好，張學良在九一八之前，購有飛機五百架，但這些飛機，平常都安放在倉庫之中，不去運用，主要的原因，就在缺乏了人，没有人去駕駛，所以戰事爆發，這倉庫中的飛機，終於送給了日本。倘日本眼前祗是購飛機不去訓練航空人村，結果定會蹈張學良的覆轍。</p>
<p>在到處鬧着航空救國的當兒，不要説上海，就是松江也在大喊着募捐集欵，購買松江號。松江是一個很小的地方，如果松江一縣，購了一架松江號，那麽江蘇全省六十縣，至少有六十架飛機。而全國也許會有一二千架飛機了。這許多飛機不要算炸燬日本全國的國土，也不是一件難事，就是降下來也許要佔盡了扶桑三島的全境呢！</p>
<p>然而我們眞如日本人所説，有了飛機，没有人駕駛，結果，不過是一種預備送人的禮物吧了！我們並不是開飛機展覧會，就是展覽了一萬架的飛機，也嚇不退半個的敵人。可知在提倡航空救國聲中，航空人材的訓練是一件急不待缓的事呢！</p>
<p>而且駕駛軍用飛機，和普通的飛機絕對不同，祗是能駕駛，依舊是不行的，至少要熟悉空中戰爭的方法，投射炸彈的技巧，才能衛國而防敵。一個航空的人，在空中週了敵機，不能心荒意嚴</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>,就是四周完全被敵機圍困了，也祗有奮力作戰，一切都須日常有所演習而訓練，否則便毫無功効。</p>
<p>所以我很望各地的民衆，在大呼［航空救國一的當兒；同時，不可不注意空軍的訓練呢。</p>

<p>— 邵黎鈺</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是受過中學敎育，家庭經濟，没有生路的青年。現在在一爿半中半西，推銷德貨的商店裏，當個小職員；到而今也有幾年了。每日工作時間，自上午八時起，至下午九時止，差不多每天有十三小時；並且平時不准告假，否則按日計算，扣除薪俸。</p>
<p>這店裏的經理，最喜歡一般趨奉拍馬的人，但我却獨樹一幟，不肯附從。因此我的工作，雖則不比他人輕易，可是待遇方面，就不能平等；我現在每月祇賺幾塊好洋鈿，僅夠一個人鞋襪費，什麽旅費，醫藥費等等，完全無着。此外他對於我的一切，也格外嚴厲。要是有一點小的差誤，他就十足擺出資本家的猙獰面孔，説什麽［你這種本領，上海要多少有多少，况且現在米價昻貴，以後再有些錯的地方，立即與我滾蛋］等話。我想聖人也有三分差，難道一個小職員，就不該有差誤的時候嗎？但是這些話，又不敢宣之於口，所以只得將眼涙往肚裏嚥。若要爭辯，除非打好舖蓋，預備滾蛋不可。</p>
<p>壁上的日曆，一張張像雪片般飛去，我的年紀，也不由你不一歲歲的加增，家庭的負担，也隨着一天天的加增。但是壓迫者仍繼續着壓迫，被壓迫者，始終也不會找到光明。長此以往，將怎樣歸宿呢？（下略）</p>
<p>邵黎鈺謹上</p>
<p>編者按：讀了邵君的來信，知道他執業的商店，雖説半中半西，　能盡如人意，但比了烟紙店，茶葉店等等十足舊式商店，好得多了。第一叚所説工作時間，每日十三小時，當然非常辛苦，但回頭一　，上海許許多多商店，那一家不是早上八點鐘開了門，一直要到晚上才關門呢！至於他們的夥計，有幾家是分班的呢！想到這裏，我想邵君怕也會心平氣和了。至於請假要扣俸一曾，我想也不過用來對付請假太多的人罷了。每年請二十天假，斷不會當眞扣俸呢。這是我們所知道的普通例規，邵君的那爿商店，或不致於例外罷。</p>
<p>至於趨奉拍馬，當然是可恥的，一個有骨氣的男子，是不應該做的；同時受趨奉受拍馬的人，當時趾高氣揚，固然快意，但是也要當心，不要吃了蜜餞砒霜。我們知道，一個人倘使没有希冀，誰肯低頭伏小，來趨奉你呢？邵君能特立獨行，保持人格，我們極端欽敬。但有一點，我們以爲對於上級職員的相當禮貌，是不能算爲拍馬的。</p>
<p>［聖人有三分錯］，這句話是値得我們體味的。一個人得了較高的位置，對於所屬的人員，他們偶而有了錯誤，很應該這樣想想，原諒他們；両可過分的嚴責他們，只可用很柔和的語氣，開導他們，希望下次不要再有同樣的不幸事件發生。不過一個人自已有了差誤，却不應該用這句話來解嘲。因爲這可以使你對於你的差誤，安之若素，不思改進呢。</p>
<p>邵君：我們希望你不要比上不足，必須比下有餘。對於你的經理，雖不必趨奉拍馬，但須相當禮貌。對於工作，力求盡職，不要自暴自棄。能夠這樣，那末可以何往不利，否則别的地方，怕也不會歡迎你呢！</p>

<p>大街上的燈光，似銀河一般的流動在市的中心，星期六那一天，那輩在黑暗的地層中工作的六天的工人，都感覺很快樂。家家商店也存着無限地希望［帶我回去罷］，一襲掛在木偶上的衣服似乎那麽説·</p>
<p>在這商業不景氣時，一般商店熱望着工人們將做工得來的現金送給他們。雖然小巷比那大街是黑暗些，可是這樣笑話不無有的，因爲小巷是認識貧窮的，而且能了解貧窮的，這静默的黑暗被那鬼般陰森的路燈的幽光所照映着。彼特團一灣到了奇蘭街，走過那本是荒地而臨時建築的禁洒會，和那偉大的愛爾蘭禮拜堂，再走過去，這條街漸漸地不平了，而且貧窮化了，房屋的牆上的粉刷已大瑰的脱落了。這些房屋在這寒風中軋軋地作響，和那地層下的開礦聲互相接應着。</p>
<p>在那街的盡頭，突然矗立着好像古代龐大的獸類的遺骨似的一根圓石柱的地方，就是末了一所房屋，那所右傾的房屋顯示着一種可怕的景象，彈得很重的鋼琴聲從門縫中放出來，長方的窗門上釘着一塊破爛的照牌［］巴脱爾　　彼特推開了門，走進去，酒館中充滿了喧譁聲，食客排成了一直線坐着，都在喝酒，吸烟，高聲的交談，雄辯。約翰李衛思！煤礦工會的領袖！的是非，做了一班坐在屋角煤屑上的工人們談話的資料。一個滿額青筋的老年人，正在重提一九零二年罷工的英雄的故事，有些人苦訴着爲了他們低微的工資，老年礦工恐惶着，爲了他們的工作漸漸地减少了，在一星期的六天中　静默的工作，流汗的苦惱，到現在可以大發洩一下了，但，彼特如同在家中一般的沉默，找着一個座位坐下。約翰顧得皮爾—給他一杯酒喝。　　約翰顧得皮爾！煤礦工人中是很聞名的，不僅是他朱枉好！他常説，除非他招待工友好，不然他不能得到什麽！但是他是個人道主義者，他信任那班工友，除酒給他們，借錢給他們，從前他曾做過礦工，但，現在在銀行中積有儲蓄，可以由他外表的闊綽上表示出來。他的發光的頭，正像一個滑球·他有一輛汽車，他的一個兒子在大學求學，希望將來做律師，還有一個將來希望做牧師。約翰顧得皮爾的生活漸漸的高貴，在美國的成功者中，他也能佔着一個地位了。</p>

<p>[P泰拉白麗兒險遭强暴</p>
<p>— 安森</p>
<p>美國移民當局之留難</p>
<p>好萊塢寰球影片公司奥籍女明星泰拉白麗兒ＴalaBirell及其姊嘉勃利拉ＧabriellaBirell係好萊塢一對異種的姊妹花。她們姊妹二人，極相愛好，幾有寢食相共，每出必偕之概。而好萊塢的人們，對於這一對解語花，亦都護惜有加。不意她們近日因駕車出游，誤入墨西哥境，歸途受美國移民當局之留難，欲歸不得，進退維谷。致遭非常之危險。故好萊塢輿論均對於移民局辦事之預颟，一致表示不滿，茲特將詳細紀之於後。</p>
<p>泰拉白麗兒性好游，有一天和她的姊姊嘉勃利拉，駕了一輛汽車，邐迤南行，走到加州極南端的聖帝哥城。此地距墨西哥境已近在咫尺，而墨西哥境内有一所好玩的所在，就是奥古阿喀林特，那裏可以游泳，可以賭錢，好似法國的蒙的卡羅。泰拉忽然想起了這個所在，並且距離不過十七英里，怎肯失之交臂，所以她們姊妹二人就商量定了，開足汽車向奥古極喀林特飛奔而去。</p>
<p>她們走了三十分鐘，走到美墨的邊境時，美國邊境移民局的警吏們，並不加以檢查，僅僅將手一揮，説［儘管去吧］。再過了一百步，那就是墨西哥境地了。墨西哥的警察亦没有什麽留難之處，僅僅問了一聲照例應有的［有上税的東西没有？］她們答了一聲［没有］，就安然過去了。她們經過了］個呌蒂也皇那的地方而達目的地。他們在奥古極喀林特吃了早餐，玩了半天，看了將近下午二時，就乘了汽車遵來路而歸。</p>
<p>她們二人一路上討論奥古阿喀林特的風为景優絕之處，不覺又回到了美墨隔界之綫，這回是墨西哥的警察行歡送禮了。他們一揮手，她們就過去了。但是美國的邊境向來是過去容易過來難的。這次美國移民局的前面有四個戎装的警士，將她們的車呌停了。喂，［你們係那國的人］？一個警士開口就問。泰拉答應説她們是奥國人。</p>
<p>［你們的護照呢］！另外一個高聲呌着。</p>
<p>可巧泰拉兩星期以前，就將一切護照文書等等整理好了帶在車上的。所以他立即將護照尋了出來，雙手奉給那面目猙的獰的警吏察看。　　他們立即圍攏來，將護照細細察看了一回。後來一個人説［不興。這個護］照没有墨西哥境内美國領事的簽字。你們要回到恩森那達，請美國的領事簽了字纔可以回來。［恩森那達在那裏］？泰拉問時已經驚惶得手足無所措了。</p>
<p>恩森那達在墨西哥的海邊上，離此有八十五哩，你們今日倘要回來的話，你們須開足馬力，快去快回。這裏下午六點鐘就不許過境的。　　泰拉向他們哀求着，説這些護照是從歐洲來的時候用的，她們並不是從墨西哥來的。她們到墨西哥，不過是去玩玩。但是那些警吏絲毫不肯放鬆，所以她們姊妹二人没有法子，祗好退入墨西哥向恩森那達去。（未完）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c258">［孽海雙鴛］觀後感 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 菁主</p>
<p>在私有財産制度没有打破之前，社會上的人們時候了遺産問題鬧得没有一刻兒安息。有的人因有承受了先人的餘蔭，酒館歌塲，養成驕奢淫所的習慣，只知消費，不事生産，造成一種高等游民，使國家社會貧弱。還有的是因爲遺産問題分配不均，致使好好的一個家庭内，兄弟姊妹情感破裂，，鬩牆操弋，公堂對簿演出種種的醜劇，這種惡現象，我們每天在報紙上都可以看到的。天一公司的［孽海雙鴛］就是針對這一點來描寫遺産制度之流毒，并明確的指示給擁着鉅大資産的富人們的出路，不應把鉅大的遺産來貽害子孫，而是應當把整千整萬的財産，興辦有益社會的事務，并創辦敎育，謀大衆的幸福。所以，這部片的意旨，是多麽有意義的啊！</p>
<p>這部片的導演的手腕的靈活，很使我們稱讚，分幕分得很合適，鏡天也擺得靈活。</p>
<p>其次如演員方面，特别是小童星邵素霞，確是一個可兒，她的活潑的姿態，窈窕的身材，表演的能力，過去在默片中已得到觀衆的好評，但在這片中更能顯出她的表演的能力，所以她的前途確有極大的希望。就是馬陋芬，在這片中的表情，也比［戰地二孤女］進步。胡珊的反派角色也還差强人意。</p>
<p>關於佈景方面：客廳，花園，佈得迫眞，唐皇宏麗，曲折玲瓏，堪稱大一傑作。</p>
<p>還有一點，就是這部片子定全没有一句字幕，也是開國産影片的新紀元。</p>
<h3 id="c259">孽海雙鴛 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>在新光的廣告上，我們知道天一公司新製有聲片［孽海雙鴛］——也就是［海上一富翁一——在昨天起開映了，凡是維護國片的人，都在希望知道牠的成績吧？</p>
<p>本事</p>
<p>上海的一位富翁，他女兒幼時被竊不知下落，只有他亡弟遺下的一位姪女，他打算把她承繼過來，不料她在外面和一位青年戀愛，而且實行同居，僱了一個使女，這個使女的假父，很巧的打聽着一切底藴，知道這使女是那富翁的親生女，富翁的弟弟在世時，爲了謀奪兄産，竊女投之於河，才被他拾來，於是他跑到富翁侄女的小宅裏借此敲詐一萬元，將那小使女留下，竟赴天津　，侄女與她戀人，知使女是富翁骨肉，恐不利於已，所以欲殺之以滅口，正在迫以服毒，却被人告發，一雙野鴛鴦和逃赴天津的［使女假］父］一併被捕入獄。</p>
<p>導演</p>
<p>邵醉翁先生，在大體上還好，小節處疏忽很多，用暗寫幻影，都弄巧成掘，末尾富翁小女，也入平民學校，却身着華服，不但階級思想未脱，而且也嫌畫蛇添足，穿挿特寫，却呌人極滿意。</p>
<p>表演</p>
<p>胡珊娟娟秀麗，飾一個驕奢淫佚的女郎，表情對白並佳，駡煞一般崇拜摩登人物，但不如［戰地二孤女］中深刻，馬陋芬極平常，邵素霞表演雖少，成績殊佳，陸麗霞大好天才曇花一現，僅就一段穿挿張振鐸老成練達很好，配角裏的吳一笑，戚拯民，倉隱秋，都有驚人的成績，的確可以誇奬，名角如蔴正中根本没露面，只有遠影一閃，而演員表上，却列在第四，不知何故。至對白文詞很好，但有時似嫌太少，不能盡意，似可商榷，攝影平常，剪接也僅僅的稱職而已，光線不甚清楚，希望天一當局以後注意一些，牠是帶累了攝影不能精彩，收音很清晰的，有些地方，與幕上動作不合，可惜得很，佈景純粹歐化，似不必評，資本是化去不少，也夠稱偉大，</p>

<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>現在來評［龍虎鬭］似乎已不合了，但因爲這張片子以前在南京開映時，各影刊除見過一篇介紹後，都没有評過，所以我覺得頗有來一個舊事重提的必要。</p>
<p>電影固然爲藝術負着重大的使命，但同時在敎育上，亦負有非常的責任，先認定了這一點，再來評這張片子，那末我們可得更加確切的評述。</p>
<p>的確這張片子中毫無情節，是支離割裂的獵獸巨段連綴而成的，但牠在你面前，展開了宙宇間的大自然，生物間的生存競爭，和獸類自相殘殺人們漁翁得利等等啓示，所以牠在藝術上，敎育上，都已達到了電影所負的使命，牠並且給我們一種暗示，！一種深刻的暗示！</p>
<p>龍虎鬭的導演，亦可以説得到相當的成功，他不但能靈巧地安排下各幕驚心動魄的戰鬭，並且適當地挿入了當地的風俗和許多輕巧而幽默的片段，這種場合，也可以説導演是在賣弄小聰明之處。</p>
<p>攝影方面，我可以武斷地説一句是偉大而技巧的，牠在各種角度下，使我們清清楚楚地看種種野獸的互相爭鬭。</p>

<p>— 時</p>
<p>王后從來没有這般的美麗，她穿了莊麗的珠翠宮服，立在王帝的身伴，她很得意，她的眼睛在閃耀着光彩，她的淺笑是怪容易現在她嘻開的兩爿嘴唇上．　　見到她，保羅覺得愛愁又已佔據了他的心靈。他但願自已有能力使他的主宰者能時常快活！但是現在，這可怖的消息將臨到她。俄國的貴族們中誰還能够完全確定他們的未來是怎樣？</p>
<p>王后正和奥國大公爵法狄南閑談着，玉雪可愛的粉臂擁圍着站在她身伴的太子。　　一面奥國大公爵又代表奥王授動與太子。那小小的太子就莊重地站立起來行着軍禮，請大公代謝奥國王帝陛下。那奥大公退出時，法國大使立刻就現在他們眼前，［陛下！我謹代］表大法國爲貴國的可悲的喪失表示悼意，蓋大公爵和敝國素相友睦，他的被剌是敝國深深地悲惜的。</p>
<p>［被剌？］王后迅捷地急切地注望着王帝。她怕她，她的丈夫，她所愛的，也許便是第二個被剌者！</p>
<p>［什麽時候？］這字音從王帝的堅峭的牙齒縫中跳躍出來。他此刻是極端地震駭着，雖在這種情緒下，可是他並未忘記他的妻。他的手保護地伸去摸着她。　　保羅和望見着，迅速地踏上前去，王后瞧見他，無力氣地説：［保羅，他説索蓋……索］</p>
<p>蓋……］她的唇在微微的笑聲中閉上了。她再也不能説下去。</p>
<p>［陛下，］保羅柔弱地微語。</p>
<p>［還是今天早里我瞧見保羅的，］她傷心地，像一個小孩般説，［那時我們還看着御衛軍］</p>

<p>［王上，我早應奏禀了，］保羅恨惘地説。［可是我瞧見你們是多麽快樂！我就不忍子。］</p>
<p>法國大使退身而下，王后又向着王帝，［他們爲什麽要害死他啊？他同你一般地最愛護］俄國的！］她再也不能忍住她的眼涙而泉擁地流下她的粉頰。［如今，我們祗有一個保羅可親］</p>
<p>了。］</p>
<p>［親愛的！］王帝握住她的手。［你須得放硬氣些……人家會瞧見的。］</p>

<h3 id="e1">Tang Yulin Departs for the Frontlines to Oversee Operations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Enemy Plans to Exert All Its Strength to Capture Our Key Forts of Chifeng, Jianping, and Lingyuan</p>
<p>Our Troops Rely on Natural Defenses Nearby and Have Constructed Extremely Solid Defensive Lines</p>
<p>Mutō Cables a Request to Japanese Headquarters to Dispatch Two More Divisions to Be Stationed Near the Border</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde reports that due to repeated reports from the frontlines, the defenses of Lingyuan and Chifeng are strained. On the 26th, Military Commander 囗囗囗 was dispatched to Lingyuan and Jianping to make arrangements. Tang received a telegram on the 27th requesting urgent assistance. On the morning of the 28th at six o'clock, he departed by car with a staff of more than 20 people to oversee operations at a certain location. A forward command post is planned to be established nearby. Tang has already telegraphed reports to the Central Government and Beiping. The Rehe Provincial Government received a telegram on the 28th stating that he is scheduled to return to Chengde on the morning of March 1st. The affairs of the garrison headquarters will be managed by Chief of Staff Li Zanting. (28th Special Telegram) (Beiping) Sun Dianying's troops departed from Chengde on the 23rd and advanced to a certain location. They reached their defensive positions on the evening of the 27th. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Because the battle line between Kailu and Chifeng in Rehe is too long, our Rehe troops have changed their strategy for the Kailu, Chaoyang, and other lines, concentrating their forces to attempt a counterattack. There is currently fierce fighting in the Xiaba and Damiao areas. The enemy plans to exert all its strength to capture our key forts of Chifeng, Jianping, and Lingyuan, in order to contain our southern forces and prevent them from attacking their rear lines in Suizhong. Our troops rely on the natural defenses near Chifeng and Lingyuan and have constructed extremely solid defensive lines. The Japanese army will not succeed. If the enemy fails to achieve its objectives in the northeast within a week, it plans to change its strategy and provoke us on the Shihe front, attempting to directly strike Chengde from the east. However, our troops are gathered at Shihe, awaiting battle in a strong defensive posture. Even if the Japanese army attacks, it will be difficult to gain an advantage. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday morning, Mutō, of the Kwantung Army stationed in Tongliao, telegraphed Japanese headquarters requesting the dispatch of two more Japanese divisions to the Rehe border. The newly arrived 34th Japanese Division in Tongliao is advancing from Dahushan via Kailu. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today's news from Chinese official circles states that the Japanese army's offensive on various fronts is not as intense as yesterday. However, this situation should not be regarded with undue optimism, as everyone knows that if the Japanese army cannot enter Rehe from the east, they will cross the Great Wall and attack Rehe from the south. Baishizu Gate is still being bombarded by heavy artillery today. Japanese planes flew over the area and took photographs of the Chinese army's positions but did not drop bombs. The fighting in the Damiao area is also relatively quiet. The Japanese army attacked the Chinese army's defensive line established on Saturday night, but failed to gain any ground after attacking for two days. Their momentum has now somewhat diminished. The Japanese army that departed from Kailu and passed through Xiaba has been blocked. Fighting continues a few miles south of Xiaba today. The Japanese claim that their infantry is now only fifteen miles away from Chifeng, but the Chinese point out that this is absurd. If the Japanese reports for the past two days were accurate, then the Japanese army would have had to advance sixty miles in twenty-two hours. This would be the fastest march in the Gobi Desert. In reality, this is impossible because the Gobi is dusty and travel is extremely slow, and temperatures at night drop to 30 degrees below zero, making travel even more unsuitable. If the Japanese army cannot break through the Chinese army's defensive lines at Lingyuan and Chifeng, they will shift to the 　River and attack from the south. The Chinese are well aware of this danger. According to the Chinese, in Chinese history, no enemy has ever entered Rehe from the east. Even the Mongol army at its height could not enter Rehe from the east; to take Rehe, they had to pass through key passes in the south, the most famous of which was Gubeikou. The Chinese are confident that if the Japanese army invades Rehe from the east, it will not succeed. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is a noteworthy change in the Rehe battle situation today. After failing to advance at Baishizu, the Japanese army suddenly moved north and launched a fierce attack west of Chaoyang. The Japanese army left sufficient troops to confront the Chinese army in the Baishizu area, while dividing its forces to launch a fierce attack on the mountain pass of Damiao, ten miles west of Chaoyang. Artillery and aircraft simultaneously bombarded the area, hoping to cut off the Chinese army's rear and rush to Jianping, located between Chifeng and Lingyuan. However, the Chinese army firmly defended the Damiao mountain pass, waiting for the enemy at their ease, and repeatedly repelled the attacking Japanese army, although the sacrifices were considerable. What can now be confirmed is that the Japanese army is gradually realizing that breaking through Rehe is more difficult than expected. The Japanese loudly proclaimed "Rehe can be taken within a week." If the Chinese army can continue to fight hard and resist, it may be difficult to succeed even in a month or several months. On Saturday night, the Chinese army deployed defenses from the west of Chaoyang southward to the Rehe border in preparation. After bombarding fiercely with aircraft and artillery for forty-eight hours, the Japanese army then launched an infantry and artillery assault, hoping to break through the Chinese army's lines in one fell swoop. But to this day, the Chinese army remains steadfast. The Japanese army now seems to have changed its tactics, no longer using Manchurian troops as the vanguard, but placing them in the rear, probably because the Manchurian troops are unreliable. According to an official telegram from Tang Yulin, on February 25, a brigade of the puppet Manchurian army under Yang Yinpu, totaling 5,000 men, defected and returned to our side near Chaoyang. Tang's telegram also stated that Japanese planes pursued and bombed the army at the time, killing many. Those who remain are confronting the enemy at Damiao. The volunteer army that retreated from Kailu reached Xiaba, seventy miles away. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese army pursued them to that location, and the volunteer army retreated again. According to the volunteer army, countless livestock died as the Japanese army crossed the desert from Kailu to Xiaba. It is said that the Mogi Brigade of cavalry lost four hundred horses which sank in the sand and died. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A nighttime telegram from the frontlines states that the battle within the territory of Damiao is still raging fiercely. The Chinese army is resisting extremely bravely, and the Japanese army has made no progress. There have been no changes at Baishizu Gate. It is reported that a unit of the volunteer army has entered a certain location near Suizhong, which is one of the Japanese army's bases. Therefore, the Japanese army is in danger of being attacked in the rear. The Japanese army, which is advancing directly from Kailu to Chifeng, has now been blocked south of Xiaba. The Chinese army has dug trenches and established a new defensive line there. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Tang Yulin Transfers a Certain Unit to Reinforce</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Repeatedly Fly Over for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chifeng states that Tang Yulin, due to the importance of Chifeng's defenses, has specially transferred a certain unit to reinforce. It arrived on the 27th, and the defenses are solid and the morale is extremely high. However, the garrison is short of food and hopes for assistance from the people in the rear. On the 27th, he telegraphed Zhu Qinglan for help. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two Japanese reconnaissance planes flew over Chifeng for reconnaissance on the morning of the 28th, circling for more than ten minutes before flying towards Chaoyang. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that the magistrate of Chifeng County, Sun Xiangzhou, telegraphed a report to the province on the morning of the 28th stating that after Cui's troops in Kailu changed to a new defensive line, the Japanese Mogi Cavalry Unit advanced from Ping'an Di, Zhala Yingzi, and Wangjia Wopu towards the Boshan Tou and Malian Chang areas of Chifeng, intending to spy on Chifeng. Brigade Commander Shi Wenhua has taken strict precautions. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) One Japanese plane flew over Chifeng County on the afternoon of the 27th for reconnaissance, scattering a large number of leaflets for half an hour before flying towards Jianping. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to strategic considerations, our army has made slight movements of its defensive lines today, to prevent the Japanese army from advancing into Jianping and threatening Chifeng from the north. Japanese sources claim that the Japanese army has occupied Fangshen, sixty miles east of Chifeng. The official authorities have not received a report, but the situation in Chifeng is indeed tense. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Kailu, the Mogi Cavalry Brigade advanced rapidly and reached Fangshen, forty kilometers northeast of Chifeng, at ten o'clock this morning. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>

Dong personally led the Second Regiment and a company of pistol-wielding soldiers to Taipingfang at eight o'clock that evening to command and supervise the battle. Taipingfang was soon recaptured, and troops were immediately divided and sent to Qinggou, Damiao, and other places to attack the flanks of Chaoyang from small roads. The fighting was extremely fierce. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dong Futing telegraphed that more than 5,000 Japanese troops, covered by artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on Damiao and Laohushan, northwest of Qidaoquanzi, from Chaoyang at seven o'clock last night. Our troops resisted along the mountain, and after four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unsuccessful. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese occupied Chaoyang, puppet troops continued to advance towards Damiao, northwest of Chaoyang, yesterday and today. The fighting was quite intense. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our troops in Lingnan are still firmly defending their original positions. The enemy's troops suffered heavy losses at Damiao. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Lingyuan states that Dong's brigade's defensive lines have been reduced to areas such as Cuo Pingfang and Daban. Dong's brigade arrived in Lingyuan on the evening of the 27th, and the brigade headquarters is located in Dacheng. (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Sun Dequan Uses Ambush Tactics Skillfully</p>
<p>The Japanese Change Their Focus to Lingyuan and Jianping</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that at seven o'clock on the afternoon of the 27th, the enemy launched a simultaneous three-pronged attack on our Lingnan positions. One prong advanced along the Sui-Ling Road, pressing our positions at Lishugoumen, Mingshuitang, and Shaomao Mountain. The second prong consisted of a joint force of Japanese troops from Jinxi County's Dayagou and Hongyaoling and Japanese troops from Chaoyang, attacking our Lingnan's First and Second Districts. The third prong was an attempt to attack our Yaolugou defense line from Lijiapu, outside of Jiunmenkou. Fierce fighting broke out simultaneously. The three prongs of the enemy army totaled more than 45,000 men, accompanied by more than ten aircraft providing cover. Artillery fire continued throughout the night. Our troops at the front responded calmly, and the situation was still deadlocked on the morning of the 28th. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde states that on the evening of the 27th, more than a thousand Japanese troops, covered by mortar fire, attacked Shaomao Mountain and were completely routed by Sun's brigade. Our army's morale was greatly boosted. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, the Japanese Suzuki and Hattori brigades attacked Shaomao Mountain and were routed by Sun Deji's and Liu Xiangjiu's brigades. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy retreated to Lishugou and Baishizu Gate. At one o'clock this morning, the enemy's garrison troops, which had been detouring from Yuguan and Jiunmenkou to Wuzishan, arrived at Mingshuitangmen and advanced directly towards Zhugao Liying, attacking Shaomao Mountain again. Fierce fighting broke out between the two sides. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Lingyuan states that the Japanese 8th Division attacked Shaomao Mountain twice on the 27th and was repelled by Sun's brigade. They abandoned many military supplies. There were more than a hundred Japanese corpses on the battlefield, having been killed by our machine gun fire. On the morning of the 28th, the Japanese headquarters moved to Lijiatun for a general attack on Lingnan, advancing from Baishizu Gate and Xintai Bianmen in two prongs, besieging Shaomao Mountain, and deploying howitzers and twelve aircraft for cover. The fighting had not stopped by noon. Our reinforcements were continuously added to the front lines, maintaining vigilance at Sanjianfang and Liujiazi to prevent Japanese troops from Chaoyang from attacking the flanks. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Frontline dispatches state that the enemy and rebel forces have been attacking Lingnan for three days and nights, suffering heavy casualties. Sun Dequan's brigade is extremely familiar with the geography of the county and often uses ambush tactics, achieving surprising results. As a result, the Japanese army is again claiming that it does not plan to attack Lingnan, giving the Chinese army a route of retreat. The Japanese army will attack Lingyuan and Jianping, but in fact our second line of defense is even more solid. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army in Lingnan has been repeatedly defeated by our army, and its morale has been weakened. As of 5:00 PM, there were no reports of any battles. The volunteer army of Zheng Guilin is very active, containing the rear lines of the Japanese army on this route, causing the Japanese army to suffer great threats. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Qindao states that after our volunteer army of Zheng Guilin occupied Mizigou, they attacked Wangziwo and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese garrison.

Our volunteer army under Feng Zhanhai and Cui Xingwu's brigade joined forces to fiercely resist. The two sides have been engaged in fierce fighting since yesterday. The Japanese army, an isolated force deep in enemy territory, is likely to suffer a disastrous defeat. More than ten Japanese aircraft from Tongliao came to their aid, and the enemy was able to escape. We have established a strong defensive position at Wangjiazhuang in Xinglongzhan. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The area from Nengliao to Kailu is controlled by Zhang Haipeng's troops, which have five cavalry detachments and four infantry detachments.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<p>[3] A Review and Prospect of Humiliation</p>
<p>[Jurchen] Before the establishment of its state, it often relied on China, paying tribute and acknowledging its vassalage. At that time, the definition of [state] was not as clear as in modern times. However, Liaodong was a county under Chinese administration beginning in the Qin Dynasty. The Liaoyang of the Han Dynasty is the present-day Fengtian. The historical facts clearly demonstrate that the three northeastern provinces are the territory of the Republic of China. Who can dare to deny this? Even though the Manchus who entered China were indeed a foreign race, their political institutions, regulations, and culture were no different from those of the Han people. Only the emperor was replaced, changing the ruling class. When the Republic of China was founded, sovereign power was returned to the 400 million citizens. In the past twenty years, there have been various disputes, but these are inevitable phenomena in the revolutionary process. They cannot be used as a pretext to deny the sovereignty of the Republic of China, nor can they be considered unique stains on the Republic of China. Transitional periods in other countries have also often witnessed such scenes. For example, in France, it took ninety years from 1789 to the establishment of the republic amidst turmoil and disputes. Since the founding of the Republic of China, for twenty-two years, there have indeed been various political and social instabilities, preventing us from achieving peace and stability. Our citizens are indeed largely to blame. Those who care about us also feel regret. However, this cannot be used as a justification to secede our territory, deny our sovereignty, trample on our people, and even disregard [justice] between nations.</p>
<p>Japan harbors malicious intentions and deliberately plans aggression. This is almost universally known. However, because our country is busy with internal strife and unable to concentrate its efforts on national defense, Japanese imperialists have been able to act arbitrarily, engaging in fabricating false evidence and provoking wars. From the Wanbaoshan Incident to the Nakamura-Ishimoto affair, the former was instigated by Japanese financial groups ordering Korean farmers to incite unrest, while the latter involved military spies reconnoitering our country's hinterland. When unexpected events occurred, they invoked special interests to suddenly attack our Liaoning and Jilin provinces on the night of September 18. At that time, Japan presented its so-called five preconditions (mainly seeking the rights acquired through aggression), along with guarantees of life and property, and local resolutions, forcing us into a treaty of surrender. At the same time, they sharpened their swords and tightened their bows, with troops advancing and attacking Heilongjiang, and invading Jinzhou to the west. Our country vacillated between peace and war, paying lip service to resistance, allowing the enemy to grow in power and lose more territory, and the situation became increasingly unmanageable.</p>
<p>The local conflicts spread to the entire country, and chaos followed. The Chinese people, compelled by circumstances, adopted the most peaceful and rational means of retaliation, hoping to attract the attention of other countries. The forceful occupation of the three northeastern provinces is not a local issue, but is related to the entire survival of the Chinese nation, and has profound and close ties with all countries in the world today. Therefore, our country's adoption of "economic isolation" against Japanese imperialists is what all humanity should have done. Unexpectedly, Japan became even more fierce, bombing Shanghai and destroying Zhabei, and while our people were catching their breath, they created a puppet regime to annex the northeast. Thus, the Japanese, invoking their so-called "benevolence," under the guise of national self-determination, single-handedly established their so-called "Manchukuo" on March 1. The world knows that the puppet regime's emergence was manufactured by the Japanese army to conceal their aggressive annexation of the three northeastern provinces. They beautified their actions by saying they were "for peace in East Asia," but in reality, the three northeastern provinces were peaceful before the Japanese militarists' invasion. After the September 18 Incident and the establishment of the puppet regime, the peaceful ["Manchuria"] became a Japanese slaughterhouse, with smoke and fire everywhere, and the sound of dogs and chickens unsettling. The Japanese imperialists used force for "special interests," and the so-called "peace" was merely an unrelated excuse.</p>
<p>Second, there was the southward advance for "defense against communism." This statement was most appealing. Even the experienced British, while guarding against the Soviet Union's encroachment on India from the south and its eastward expansion into China, also believed that Japan truly had the intention of "anti-communism" and the "power" to "suppress communism." Therefore, for more than a year, they expressed goodwill towards Japan, helping their iron hooves to roam freely and realize their conspiracy of annexation. When the Shanhaiguan was seized, Rehe was in a state of emergency, and Tianjin and Beiping were also in imminent danger, the countries of Britain and France began to understand that Japan's true intention was not to "guard against communism" but to occupy land, and not to resist the southward advance of communist forces but to monopolize the Chinese market. They used the name of anti-communism to manipulate countries around the world and exploit psychological terror to achieve their goals of aggression. Now the truth is clear. The League of Nations resolutely denied the [puppet state] and condemned the Japanese military on February 24, and our country has been deceived all along?</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the sovereignty over the northeastern territory belongs to us. The moral sanction of the League of Nations, with forty-two votes against one, can be said to have exhausted the "justice" of its abilities. However, this is only the [League of Nations overcoming itself] and overcoming the contradiction between advocating peace and condoning war. Can we over-hope that the League of Nations will use practical and effective methods to sanction the Japanese military's atrocities? We shouldn't entertain this illusion. Therefore, the battle of words should end, and the war of iron and blood should begin. Our country has suffered terrible disasters, so how can we continue to adhere to a policy of non-resistance or partial resistance, hoping for temporary peace that cannot be obtained? On this day of the puppet regime's anniversary, we should use an iron fist to toll the death knell of the puppet regime, launching our country's active and vigorous national struggle. Immediately and resolutely order the crusade against the puppet regime, wash away this humiliation with red blood, and scatter red blood across the northeast to recover our former homeland.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Foreign News: Since Japan plans to withdraw from the League of Nations, Foreign Minister Uchida has given full consideration to its diplomatic policy towards the United States and has decided to abandon its past textbook-style diplomacy and replace it with a friendly diplomacy policy. According to those close to the Foreign Minister, the first step in changing the diplomatic policy towards the United States is to recall Ambassador Debuchi to the United States and replace him with Matsumoto. It remains to be seen whether his proposal can be realized. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) After failing at the League of Nations, Japanese representative Matsumoto became angry and today publicly scolded the American Associated Press reporter here, saying that the United States no longer has the demeanor of a diplomat and that Japan will regard the United States' participation in the League of Nations' proposed negotiation committee as suspicious and untrustworthy. The American people have long treated people unfairly, and even the American government is the same. The United States and the American people forgive China's mistakes and exaggerate Japan's mistakes.

<p>Our Government Believes It Will Increase Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>US Action to Be Decided After Roosevelt Takes Office</p>
<p>Simon Says Sanctions Against Japan Must Be Carefully Considered</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A notification from Britain regarding the ban on arms exports to both China and Japan has been received here. Opinions on this matter vary widely. The Chinese authorities believe that while Britain's intention to prevent the expansion of conflict and avoid bloodshed by banning arms exports is understandable, this step will not maintain peace but will instead increase Japan's power of aggression against China. This is because the Japanese are very well equipped with weapons, while China can be said to have virtually no modern weapons. If arms sales to China are prohibited, China will have no means to resist Japanese attacks. Moreover, Japan has anticipated this move and can now purchase arms from Siam, which is not subject to the embargo. Therefore, to maintain peace, countries should seek international coordination and only implement arms export bans against aggressors. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) When Foreign Secretary Simon announced the ban on arms shipments to the Far East in the House of Commons yesterday, he mentioned the 1931 arms embargo, which tightened previous restrictions. The order prohibits the export or shipment of the following arms to foreign ports, except for those with licenses from the Board of Trade: cannons, other artillery pieces, gun carriages, ammunition, explosives, firearms, grenades, machine guns, projectiles, mines, bombs, grenade launchers, incendiary devices, fuses, torpedoes, torpedo tubes, fire extinguishers, sights, bayonets, knives, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft. Parts for the aforementioned arms are also included in the ban. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although official circles have not yet commented on the British government's decision on the arms embargo, public opinion is quite shocked, believing that it suits Japan's strategy. Japan's military equipment is extremely abundant, and its stock of military supplies is greater than China's. Moreover, China's best arsenal, the Shenyang Arsenal, has long been coveted by Japan. (Reuters, 28th) (London) The Chinese in London are dissatisfied with the British Foreign Secretary Simon's announcement of the Far East arms embargo, which includes China. They argue that the League of Nations recognizes China as innocent and accuses Japan of aggression. Now, Britain is treating China and Japan the same, which is unfair. The Chinese side is awaiting instructions from Nanjing and has not yet considered lodging a protest. The Japanese side does not wish to comment on the British Foreign Secretary's announcement. (Reuters, 28th) (Washington) No action will be taken on President Hoover's proposal to ban arms shipments to belligerent countries during this session of the House of Representatives. Today, the Democrats are obstructing any action and a solution must wait until the House convenes in the next session. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Borah, upon hearing of the British government's decision to ban arms exports to China and Japan, stated that he does not approve of following Britain's lead. Cooperation between Britain and the United States regarding the arms embargo to the Far East is currently being blocked by Congress. The current bill in the House only prohibits arms shipments to South America, so the US President only has the power to prohibit arms supplies to South America and Chinese rebels. The Senate recently passed a bill advocating a worldwide arms embargo, but soon decided to reconsider it, leading to its being shelved. However, the US government expresses sympathy for the British arms embargo, but fears that Congress will not act quickly and may not approve the same actions as Britain until a special spring session is convened. Some members of Congress who represent the interests of arms manufacturers may object to this embargo. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon contacted the United States regarding the arms embargo issue. The United States responded today, stating that the US authorities do not have the power to prohibit arms exports. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During today's cabinet meeting, the issue of banning arms shipments to the Far East was not discussed because there were many difficult cabinet matters requiring discussion. However, the government stated that it would follow the League of Nations in all matters. (Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, US Secretary of State-designate Hull met with British Ambassador Lindsay for a long time. Afterwards, he only stated that the discussion concerned a broad plan to restore trade among nations and declined to provide details. However, it is generally believed here that the two discussed not only war debts, the economy, and general diplomatic issues, but also the Manchurian issue and the ban on arms shipments to the Far East. The Democratic Party has not yet made a general decision on this issue. Only a few members of the party have advocated banning arms shipments to all countries, regardless of whether they are at war. The Republican Party generally advocates limiting the scope of the ban to belligerent countries only. Senator Borah alone argues that there should be no embargo on China and Japan, because Japan can manufacture its own, while China must rely on others for supply. An embargo would indirectly help Japan. It is expected that the new government will soon announce its position on this issue, because all countries insist that arms embargo actions must be consistent worldwide, and the US cannot remain silent. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that for arms previously ordered from Britain, both China and Japan will be treated equally and avoid the impact of the embargo. The 1931 arms law mentioned by British Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons refers to weapons of war such as arms, ammunition, and aircraft. The government believes tonight that this embargo is a measure to cut off external problems to prevent their spread, and at the same time, to encourage other countries to follow suit. If an international agreement cannot be reached in the future, Britain will reconsider its decision. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Careful Consideration of Sanctions <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(London) After British Foreign Secretary Simon announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that Britain would no longer issue licenses for arms shipments to China and Japan from today onwards, Liberal Party leader Samuel stated that British public opinion is currently very dissatisfied with the Japanese government's actions in China. This is purely in terms of the rights and wrongs of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Imposing a uniform arms embargo on both sides is more unfavorable to China than to Japan because China relies entirely on foreign arms supplies. He is certain that the British people want Britain to not provide any assistance to Japan, not only in terms of arms but also in terms of loans and credit. Economic power, coupled with the moral pressure of public opinion, will eventually bring Japan to its senses. Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain stated that his sympathy for Japan has diminished with the development of the situation. We have now reached the stage where it is certain that Japan's actions in Manchuria are in serious violation of its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan is acting rashly and engaging in risky ventures. The consequences may be far-reaching, and the price in blood and finance will be greater than the Japanese people can foresee. The House eventually rejected the motion by Labour Party leader Lansbury to reduce external expenditure. Foreign Secretary Simon concluded the debate, referring to the issue of sanctions raised by Labour MP Cripps, saying that this matter is of utmost importance and should not be discussed without careful consideration. Those who are loudly calling for sanctions now may not be able to influence the League of Nations' decision. As for the arms embargo, the British government is acting with complete friendship towards both China and Japan. He does not believe that this move is biased towards either side. Britain cannot unilaterally take actions that discriminate between the two sides. He hopes that an international agreement on future actions can be reached soon. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese political circles expressed their views on the speech made by the British Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that the arms embargo is more unfavorable to China than to Japan. Although Simon's speech expressed sympathy for Japan's difficulties, his words can be seen as blaming Japan, which angered the Japanese. If the embargo were imposed on China and Japan without any bias, then this anger could be concealed. But if it is imposed on Japan, then Japan will inevitably find ways to prevent arms from reaching China. Official circles believe that the raw materials for manufacturing arms may not be prohibited, but if this is also prohibited, the consequences will be very serious and unpredictable, because Japan must take some action. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e15">British and American Public Opinion <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(London) This morning, newspapers commented on Foreign Secretary Simon's announcement in the House of Commons last night of a ban on arms exports to the Far East. Some praised it as cautious, while others criticized it frankly. Except for The Times, all said that Britain's unilateral ban would be ineffective. The Times warmly praised the British government for taking this emergency action swiftly, and believed that public opinion would approve of it. Some said that the uniform ban on China and Japan was unfair to China. It should be known that Foreign Secretary Simon's theory that a single country should not favor one side over the other in a dispute is justified. Moreover, arms shipped to China are likely to fall into the hands of the Japanese, so a uniform ban is appropriate in practice. The most prudent course of action at present is only to prohibit British arms from being shipped to the Far East, so as not to implicate Britain. The second step is to reach an agreement with other arms-manufacturing countries, especially the United States, to either change or cancel today's policy, or suspend its implementation. If countries can follow Britain's lead and work together to achieve effective arms limitation in peacetime, the hope of a country waging an unlimited and prolonged war will be even more remote. However, further consideration should be given to ensuring that this approach will not be applied to countries that are invaded in the future, so as not to violate justice. The Morning Post believes that this embargo will be ineffective and merely a costly gesture. The Daily Telegraph said that a single country taking this action has nothing to do with war. As for the hope of an international agreement, it is even more remote than Simon admitted. The Daily News cautiously welcomed the decision, but said that it should not be merely a gesture and should be quickly replaced by a larger and more stringent plan, and that if Britain acts alone, it may be difficult to distinguish between China and Japan in the future. Only supporting international condemnation of Japan and international action can avoid this. The Daily Mail said that the embargo is extremely foolish, and its only foreseeable result is to increase unemployment in Britain. The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, attacked Simon's statement that Britain could not take sides in the dispute, saying that while this statement is obvious in words, Japan will see it as Britain not endorsing the implementation of the covenant to resist Japan. This is exactly the assurance that the Japanese military wants to continue to obtain. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Daily News editorial advocated that the world should ban the export of arms to Japan as an act of self-respect. The newspaper also stated that Americans' refusal to buy Japanese goods is already foreseeable, because many far-sighted Washington merchants have stopped importing Japanese goods. The New York Herald Tribune editorial stated that Matsuoka's speech in the League of Nations, claiming that Manchuria was obtained by Japan from Soviet Russia and that Manchuria's development was due to Japan's management, contradicts the theory that [Manchukuo] is a natural product. Armed occupation of Manchuria is naturally not an act of self-defense. Recognizing [Manchukuo] would violate Articles 1 and 2 of the Washington Five-Power Treaty. The New York Times editorial stated that Stimson's reply to the nation contained a notification to Japan, and that the new Secretary of State Hull will continue its inherent policy.

If you have any rationality, you should immediately abandon all illusions and express unity against Japan. Then all previous mistakes can be written off. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Huang Shaoxiong has been discussing the anti-Japanese national defense plan proposed by the Southwest with Chiang Kai-shek for several days, and considerable progress has been made. Huang will return to Nanjing immediately. It is heard that the Southwest originally focused on resisting foreign aggression, so the National Defense Council was established. Chiang Kai-shek believes that to resist Japan, it is necessary to remove the obstacles to resisting Japan. Anti-Japanese suppression of the communists should be taken care of simultaneously. First, concentrate all forces to suppress the communists, with one month as the deadline, and defeat the main force of the bandits. Then return to Nanjing and go north, and the large army for suppressing the communists can be transferred to resist Japan. The central government will send personnel and the Guangdong authorities will be responsible for the aftermath in the bandit areas. Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed this intention to Jiang, Cai, Yue, Chen, Gui, and Li in Fujian, and they have been understood and agreed to send troops to assist in the suppression. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek greatly approves of the anti-Japanese opinions and national defense organization brought by Feng [Yu-hsiang] through Huang Shaogu in principle, and will participate in the specific measures.

<p>(Hong Kong) The American ship "Mei Xi Mei Lun" departed from Hong Kong to Shantou on the 27th and was hijacked by eight pirates, who kidnapped three passengers and injured the first mate. They sailed to Dapeng Bay, landed, and escaped, losing about 3,000 yuan in stolen goods. The pirates boarded the ship in Hong Kong. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Danish ship "Gustav Ditlevsen" was en route from Hong Kong to Shantou when it encountered pirates and was taken to Dapeng Bay. It was thoroughly searched. The ship has a displacement of 135 tons and is now sailing back to Hong Kong from Dapeng Bay. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) When the pirates attacked the Danish ship "Gustav Ditlevsen", they shot the first mate Nielsen in the chest, but the injury is not dangerous. It is learned that the pirates landed at Mos Bay in English waters and did not take the ship to Dapeng Bay. The local naval authorities have taken no action on this matter because it is too late. The robbery site is only two hours away from Hong Kong. There were only eight pirates. When the attack occurred, the first mate happened to be steering the ship in place of Captain Jacobsen. The pirates rushed to the bridge. Nielsen tried to stop them and was shot. The pirates then carried Nielsen into the captain's room, and the five European crew members were also controlled and detained in the room at gunpoint. For the next hour, the ship sailed irregularly because no one was steering it. The situation was very dangerous because there was a risk of hitting a reef or running aground. Then the captain persuaded the pirate leader to allow him to steer. The pirate leader then ordered the ship to sail to Siwan. When the pirates landed, they took three Chinese passengers from the dining room and fled into Chinese territory. The ship's wireless transmitter was destroyed, but the first mate, who was the ship's radio operator, despite being shot, crawled out of the room and helped his companions repair the machine and send out a distress call. The captain called this the bravest act he had ever seen in his life. When the ship arrived in Hong Kong, it was found that Nielsen had been shot in the abdomen. Although the injury was serious, it was not dangerous. He has been sent to the hospital for treatment. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Bolshevik Revolutionary Signal <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<h3 id="e74">Many Communist Leaders Arrested <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency, Berlin, 27th: Tonight, at nearly 9:00 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out in the Reichstag building. The flames were raging, and could be seen from afar in Berlin. Fire brigades from all over the city heard the alarm and rushed to help put out the fire. At this time, rumors spread in Berlin, and the people were very panicked. Some said that fires had broken out simultaneously in four places, and one place was caused by a bomb explosion. Therefore, there is no doubt that this fire was caused by arson by rioters. After an hour and a half of hard work by the fire brigades, the flames were finally suppressed, but the Reichstag building had been burned down, causing incalculable losses. The grand assembly hall was completely burned down, and the large dome of the building, which was once a magnificent sight admired by the masses, has now collapsed due to the intense heat, and a part of it has already collapsed. When the fire subsided slightly, the police immediately searched many places around and arrested a Dutchman. After police interrogation, it was learned that the man's name was Luba, only 24 years old. According to Luba's confession, he acted alone and had no party affiliation. However, according to outside reports, fires broke out simultaneously in no less than twenty places in the city, and there may be a major conspiracy behind it. Therefore, the police are still searching.</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Berlin, 28th: Police are now stationed at various key points in the city, and people are still very panicked. The National Socialist Party's stormtroopers and the Steel Helmet organization have formed emergency police teams to prepare for incidents. According to police investigations, this arson was meticulously planned. Flammable materials and explosives were hidden in four places inside the Reichstag building. The main hall has been completely destroyed, and the audience seats, press rooms, and rest rooms have also been severely damaged. This proves that the perpetrators are not limited to Luba alone, and there must be accomplices. It is expected that the detained communists will be interrogated and the truth will come out. As for the communists' planned uprising plan, it has not been fully released, and the party is also investigating suspected persons. It is expected that there will be more arrests. However, although this conspiracy to start an incident has been completely suppressed, the people in various places are deeply afraid that the communists, out of anger and resentment, will retaliate, so they are quite panicked.</p>
<p>The Berlin Reichstag building is located in Republic Square, very close to Brandenburg Gate. Adjacent to it is the Tiergarten. It was built in 1894 by the famous architect Wallot according to the wishes of the deposed emperor. It is truly a magnificent masterpiece of the previous generation.</p>
<p>Before the Reichstag building caught fire, a fire also broke out in the deposed German Emperor's Palace. The deposed palace is located next to the Lustgarten and is the most magnificent building on Unter den Linden Street in Berlin. When the guards discovered black smoke, they immediately went inside to inspect and found a room with a large amount of flammable material burning. Therefore, they immediately extinguished it, preventing a major disaster. The arrested Dutchman has admitted that he also set the fire in the deposed palace, but insisted that he had no accomplices.</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Berlin, 28th: Yesterday, the cabinet meeting passed the Law on Punishing Treason. Any soldier who commits treasonous acts will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death. Spreading rumors abroad to endanger the country will also be punished. This order can be signed by President von Hindenburg today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th: Goering, the Prussian Minister of the Interior, issued a public statement on the Reichstag fire, saying that this was the most serious act of violence committed by German Bolsheviks in history. The statement announced that Communist Party members will be arrested within days. It also stated that the recent seizure of the Communist Party headquarters in Berlin revealed a plan that proves that today's fire was a signal for a Bolshevik revolution. After the Reichstag caught fire, the police arrested two people inside, said to be a Dutchman named Luba, who confessed to arson but did not admit to being instructed by anyone. All Communist Party newspapers in Prussia have been banned from publication for four weeks, and Socialist Party newspapers have been banned for two weeks.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th: Goering has ordered the arrest of Communist Party members, numbering nearly 100. This morning, police confiscated all Communist Party and Socialist Party newspapers, leaflets, and periodicals in Berlin and banned their continuation. Police searched the Forward newspaper office and took away two truckloads of confiscated newspapers. Reuters, Berlin, 28th: The authorities have arrested 80 communists, including 38 leaders. The Communist Party's legal advisor, Li Deng, is also among them. It is heard that Luba is well-known in American police circles. He is a member of the Dutch Communist Party and obtained a passport in 1931 to travel to Russia. Nothing has been heard of him since then, until last night, when his name became known. The damage to the Reichstag caused by the fire will take several months to repair, so there is no venue available for the time being. The Prussian parliament hall is too small, and the new parliament may be held in another town in Germany in the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th: According to Goering, the Communist Party is determined to continue to carry out terrorist acts and will dress in police, Steel Helmet organization, and National Socialist Party uniforms to do so. The authorities also announced that Sunday's general election will proceed as usual without any hindrance. 130 people have been arrested in Berlin, and 140 people have been arrested in Hanover.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Colombia and Peru Cease Fire <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency, Geneva, 27th: The governments of Colombia and Peru have notified the League of Nations that they will cease hostilities and order their troops to remain in their current positions, pending detailed discussions by the League of Nations on who should own Leticia and its adjacent areas. According to telegrams received here, the two governments have ordered their commanders to cease all military activities and await further orders. The financial difficulties of the two countries, coupled with the pressure exerted by neutral countries, finally forced the two governments to reluctantly comply with the advice of other countries to stop their undeclared war and abide by the current peace treaties. The League of Nations will hold a meeting soon to discuss Peru's request to amend the Solomon-Lozano Treaties and return the port of Leticia to Peru. The reason given is that since the signing of the treaty ceding the port of Leticia to Colombia, the Colombian government has not fulfilled other provisions in the treaty.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 28th: The League of Nations Council has established a three-person committee to handle the dispute between Colombia and Peru. After meeting last night, the committee submitted clear recommendations to Peru, the conditions of which are more resolute than previous recommendations. The committee insists on sending a temporary administrative committee to Leticia, composed of one person from Brazil, one person from the United States, and one person from Switzerland. If a written reply of Peru's approval in principle is received in Geneva, the Council will meet tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Conference on Disarmament Agrees Not to Resort to Force <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Its Scope Limited to Europe</p>
<p>Amendment to the Pact of Paris</p>
<p>Will Arouse Strong Opposition</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 28th – The Drafting Committee of the Conference on Disarmament is currently studying the British proposal for an early declaration stating non-resort to force. Today, it agreed on the following draft declaration: "The governments of [blank countries], in order to enhance the spirit of mutual trust among European nations and to promote the cause of disarmament, and being deeply concerned about a joint declaration explicitly prohibiting the use of force in the context of the Paris Pact, solemnly declare that under no circumstances shall they resort to force against one another as an instrument of national policy." This draft will be discussed by the Political Committee at a later date and is expected to arouse strong opposition, especially from Soviet Russia. It is also reported that Denmark, Norway, and Sweden will also consider this declaration insufficient, as they understand it to be an amendment to the Paris Pact, attached with all the reservations contained in the Paris Pact. It is further reported that difficulties have arisen in the Aviation Committee. Germany insists on being certain that military aircraft can be abolished before it is willing to discuss the internationalization of civil aviation. This morning, representatives from Britain, Germany, and Spain discussed the matter. The German representative refused to attend the meeting and declined to participate in the discussion. The British and Spanish representatives then decided to adjourn the Aviation Committee indefinitely. Germany's obstruction in various levels of the Conference on Disarmament is becoming increasingly forceful, as Germany seeks to obtain a satisfactory solution on the issue of equality in disarmament.</p>

<p>Farewell Letter to Party Members Emphasizes National Affairs as Paramount</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 27th – President Hoover sent a farewell letter to the Republican National Committee, thanking the Republican Party for bestowing him with high honor, and encouraging the party to support the new government's sound actions that benefit the overall situation, stating that at this time, the interests of the people should be paramount, and wholehearted cooperation should be given, setting aside partisan views for the time being.

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 27th – According to a telegram from New York's Hyde, President-elect Roosevelt's inaugural address will only take eight minutes to complete. Therefore, it is widely believed that Roosevelt will not elaborate on the new government's foreign policy but will leave it to the new Secretary of State, Hull, to announce. However, informed sources here also believe that Hull may not make a general statement either, but will only reveal information from time to time in his talks with various countries and in diplomatic notes. This approach is different from the Republican Party's practice. People here feel deeply disappointed by the news that the inaugural address will be so brief and that Roosevelt only began drafting it today.</p>

<p>Zhu Qinglan's circular telegram reads: (Titles omitted) "Greetings to all. Recently, the enemy has invaded the province of Jehol, advancing relentlessly. In a matter of days, the situation has deteriorated. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers have fought bravely to resist and responded calmly, enabling us to maintain the precarious situation. The terrain of Jehol is strategically important, serving as a base for the recovery of lost territory. Therefore, the survival of the province is critically important, relating to the future of the military and the attention of the international community. In other words, saving Jehol is saving the Northeast, and thus saving the nation. The situation is extremely critical, and a moment's delay could be devastating. However, our comrades in the front lines lack food, supplies, clothing, and footwear. Without a continuous supply, how can they resist for long? Furthermore, the number of refugees in the war zone is increasing daily. Homes are destroyed, and people are dying, with nowhere to live. Qinglan has personally experienced the situation in Jehol and witnessed the suffering firsthand. The state of the nation is such that I am filled with sorrow. I hope that compatriots from all walks of life will share these difficult times and unite to save the nation. I earnestly implore you that any donations of funds be sent to the Shanghai Jing'an Temple Road Local Association or the Northeast Refugee Relief Association at 40 Ningbo Road, Guangzhao Public Hall. Those in the north can send donations to the Beiping Newspaper Street 74 National Government Relief Committee, Beiping Office, or any of the major banks such as the Bank of China, the Jiaotong Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Dalu Bank, and the Salt Bank, which can forward the donations. Qinglan will personally ensure that they are distributed effectively to live up to the good intentions of those who are concerned. Zhu Qinglan bows in respect."</p>
<h3 id="e82">Nanjing Road Business Community Notifies Merchants to Donate to Save the Nation <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Federation and the First District Branch of the Municipal Federation, in view of the worsening situation in the Northeast, specially notified their member merchants yesterday to promptly donate to support the front lines. The association's notice is recorded as follows: "The situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly precarious. If Jehol falls, then Mongolia will inevitably be seized by Japan as well, fulfilling their policy of unifying Manchuria and Mongolia. At the same time, Tianjin and Beiping are in danger and may force our authorities to make deals under duress. Although the soldiers are willing to fight, the overall situation has passed the point where defeat can be turned into victory. If we rely on the help of other countries and create a major war, without first discussing who will win or lose or what the aims of each country are, then our country's land will be turned into a battlefield, and the loss of life and property will be unspeakable. Therefore, the best plan for now is to make a concerted effort, to ensure that the soldiers are used wisely, first to hold the ground and prevent its loss, and then to turn defense into offense, directly attack the puppet state, drive out the invaders, and recover our territory. However, for the soldiers to be able to win, they must rely on sharp weapons as their vanguard and the spirit of the people as their rearguard. Although the Shanghai business community has suffered from the impact of the January 28th Incident, affecting both the economy and business, if we think about the environment after the Northeast is definitively lost and the war is lost, or perhaps even the current situation will not be able to be preserved, then rather than regretting it later, why not follow the example of Xian Gao, who lightly valued wealth to save his country, and Bu Shi, who transported supplies to help the border, so that the front lines can receive our support and boost their morale to frustrate the enemy? Therefore, we dare to implore our members and colleagues to open their purses as soon as possible. The more you give, the better, but even a small amount is still appreciated. As for the collection points and methods of use, we must seek public resolution of good strategies and implement them in order. This association's work has always sought openness, and we hope that you will review and support us to jointly plan to save the nation. This is our notice."</p>

<p>Reporting on the war situation at the front line of anti-Japanese efforts</p>
<p>Soliciting donations from all sectors</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of National Universities and Colleges in Pingjin previously sent representatives with military supplies to inspect the military appearance on the front lines of Jehol and to reward the anti-Japanese soldiers. After returning to Beiping, they convened a plenary meeting to expand publicity and assist the blood-fighting soldiers. It was decided to send four representatives to different regions to promote the cause throughout the provinces and negotiate unified assistance methods. The second district includes the four provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, and Mr. Liu Shichuan was sent there. The second district includes the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and Mr. Cai Zengtang was sent there. The fourth district includes the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, and Mr. Jia Chengzhang was sent there. The third district includes the four provinces of Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, and Mr. Mou Mo is representing. Mr. Mou left Beiping on the 19th and stayed in Jinan and Nanjing for a few days to run around and negotiate with all sectors and openly report on the anti-Japanese situation on the front line. He left Nanjing on the evening of the 26th and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. He will contact all parties and is scheduled to host the press this afternoon. The Municipal Bureau of Education is scheduled to convene all principals of secondary schools and above in the city at the Bureau of Education on the 1st to ask him to report. It is reported that Mr. Mou will stay in Shanghai for five or six days before heading to Zhejiang and Anhui for publicity. The Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Mou the night before last for a long interview. Details are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Situation on the Front Line <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Since the fall of Shanhaiguan, the people of Pingjin</p>
<p>are in a state of panic and are flocking to all directions to seek refuge. The area around the East Legation Quarter has suddenly seen an increase in wealthy guests, and all major hotels are full, with even those who pre-register. The education community, not knowing the truth, is even more worried about the social unrest and convened a joint meeting of representatives. Representatives from all national universities and colleges in Pingjin attended. At that time, they all advocated sending representatives to the front lines to inspect the actual situation, but the war zone was dangerous, and the representatives would bear heavy responsibility if they encountered misfortune. Therefore, they changed to voluntary registration. Nine people signed up on the spot, but only four remained when they set off. Despite various difficulties, they were still able to reach the front lines. Mr. Mou, who is traveling south this time, is also one of those who personally went to the front lines. The military situation on the front line, according to Mr. Mou, is very exciting, and the morale of the people is particularly strong. People drive their cars to transport supplies for the army and even carry baskets to help the engineers dig trenches. The soldiers on the front lines, though thinly clothed, do not show any sign of shrinking back. Upon hearing the sound of killing the enemy, they become even more excited. However, while the military morale is high, the supply of materials is really lacking. The most important thing is the vehicles for transportation and the cold-proof and bullet-proof helmets. A detailed investigation has been carried out and reported to all sectors for careful consideration for purchase and donation.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Donations from Pingjin <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>After Mr. Mou and others returned to Beiping, they convened a</p>
<p>plenary meeting to discuss assistance methods. On the spot, the entire body voluntarily donated 20% of their salaries, totaling 72,000 yuan. They purchased 36 trucks and steel helmets, gas masks, etc. and transported them to Jehol. At the same time, they reported to all sectors. More than 50 households have moved back from the East Legation Quarter, and the number of hotel guests has gradually decreased. With the people's hearts settled, they collectively planned assistance strategies. In a few days, the banking sector raised 60,000 yuan, the military and political sector raised 50,000 yuan, and the industrial and commercial sector raised 20,000 yuan. However, although the people in the Pingjin area are enthusiastic about donating, the amount is still small. Therefore, it was decided to send representatives to promote the cause throughout the provinces and to negotiate assistance methods. The four representatives all left Beiping on the 19th and went to different places.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Experiences Traveling South <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Mou Mo was assigned to the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shandong for publicity. According to Mr. Mou, when the general meeting made the resolution, he was bedridden due to the hardships of traveling north. After receiving the news, his illness worsened. However, due to the encouragement of friends and the drive of patriotism, he embarked on the journey despite his illness. He left Tianjin on the 19th of last month and arrived in Jinan on the 20th. He stayed for two days, contacting all sectors, and gave a public report at the People's Education Center, which was attended by thousands of people. The presentation lasted for more than two hours, and no one showed signs of fatigue. He left Jinan on the 22nd and arrived in Nanjing on the 23rd. He also reported to and contacted all sectors of the Party and government. All parties gave him a warm welcome and set up a general office at the Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters. He originally planned to stay in Nanjing for three days, but he delayed it for one day at the request of the People's Education Center. He came to Shanghai this morning. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and its people's patriotic fervor is no less than that of other places. During the January 28th Incident last year, the rear support was particularly enthusiastic. Therefore, I have great hope for Shanghai and wish to stay for a few days to talk in detail with all sectors. After arriving in Shanghai today, I immediately visited Mayor Wu and Director Pan, who both gave me enthusiastic instructions. It has now been decided to host the press at noon tomorrow (28th). Director Pan also promised to convene all principals of secondary schools and above in the city at the Bureau of Education on Thursday for me to report. As for the Northeast Association and the Local Association, I will also contact them. After completing these tasks, I will immediately go to Hangzhou, then to Anhui, and return to Beiping.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram yesterday from Deng Wen, military commander of Ma Zhanshan's troops: "The Japanese bandits are rampaging and forcefully occupying the Northeast. Chairman Ma Zhanshan is leading our Heilongjiang soldiers to hoist the banner of justice and fight the Japanese enemy. We swear to never yield and to set an example for the world. However, how can Heilongjiang, a poor province, stand up to the wealth of the entire Japanese nation? Its defeat was expected by Wen and others. When the Soviet army suddenly lost, our army's retreat was also cut off. Wen then followed Chairman Ma's orders to go to Jehol, fighting thousands of miles over many months. More than a thousand officers and soldiers died from the enemy's artillery fire, and six or seven hundred died from starvation. This situation has been reported in previous telegrams. Today, the violent Japanese do not respect international justice or abide by the rule of law. They are invading Jehol on a large scale, and North China is shaken. Our army is once again at the forefront. Wen should continue to fight hard with Chairman Ma to reverse the decline, and we have an unshirkable responsibility to fight the Japanese to the death. However, our tens of thousands of brave soldiers who have been fighting for years, trekking thousands of miles, risking their lives, and sacrificing themselves for the country have no pay and no clothes to cover their bodies. Moreover, their horses have no saddles, and the people are barefoot and unkempt, like prisoners. As the commander, how can Wen drive them to fight? I also cannot bear to drive them to fight. Those who came before have not completely changed their clothes, and those who come later are likely to be even more discouraged. Therefore, I specially send this telegram to your association, earnestly requesting further assistance, such as military uniforms, underwear, socks, boots, cotton blankets, horse saddles, large and small radios, telephone equipment, and trucks. If we have supplements, we can boost the morale of the soldiers and display the power of our army, annihilating those ugly captives and returning our territory. This will not only be deeply engraved in the hearts of all soldiers in the enemy army, but it is also truly reliant on the future of the country. Deng Wen, Commander of the First Army of Heilongjiang, bows."</p>

The Rice Measurers' Union has submitted a request to the Party and government authorities for relief and also requested permission to independently organize a Rice Measurers' Management Committee to exercise fair authority. The Municipal Party Department's Civil Affairs Section has submitted it to the review board for review.</p>

<p>A Total of 36,180 Sets Collected</p>
<p>Those Who Have Not Paid Will Request Instructions from the Ministry of Transportation for a Decision</p>
<p>Since China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was nationalized, the Board of Directors, under the order of the Ministry of Transportation, has been working with the Central Bank to buy back commercial shares, stipulating 50 taels of silver per set, with a deadline of the end of February. Yesterday was the deadline for the buyback of commercial shares. The notice issued by the Central Bank's verification and buyback of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shares stated, "[Ministry Order Approved, Deadline is February 28th]." A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with the staff member of the Board of Directors stationed at the Central Bank to handle the buyback of shares at 7:00 PM yesterday. According to the staff member, the number of people who verified their shares was very crowded starting on the 25th. The total number of shares was 40,000 sets, and 36,280 sets had been bought back. Only more than 3,000 sets in Guangdong had not been paid. However, a phone call was received informing us that 300 sets in Guangdong had arrived in Shanghai and would be paid soon. Therefore, the original office hours were until 5:00 PM, but the decision has now been made to extend it to 6:00 PM. However, although people will report their arrival at that time, they will not bring their shares. The reporter also met with General Manager Liu Hongsheng, who said that the decision to buy back the shares by the deadline was made under the order of the Ministry of Transportation.

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration issued a notice yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of the notice, it is found that railway materials are imported from overseas every year, amounting to a considerable sum. Recognizing the importance of recovering rights and interests, this bureau has always strived to select domestic products for use on both railways. Fortunately, domestic manufacturers have deeply understood this purpose, and many have come to register and donate samples to demonstrate their full cooperation. We hereby solemnly announce again that this bureau will make every effort to adopt domestic railway materials. Unless absolutely necessary, we will never purchase imported goods. We hope that all merchants will find ways to obtain valid proof that they are domestic products, and ensure that the products, such as dimensions and quality, accurately meet the needs of the railway and are sufficiently supplied, and register as soon as possible.

<p>Ten thousand dollars borrowed with charitable champagne as collateral. The China &amp; South Sea Bank and a certain money shop each loaned half of the amount. The Shanghai Provisional Relief Association for the Disasters in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Provinces, considering that the disaster areas in the three provinces were in dire need of relief, and that the Golden Bridge race meeting was too slow to provide assistance, specifically devised a method to borrow 100,000 yuan from Mr. So-and-so in the money industry, using charitable champagne as collateral, for urgent relief. Yesterday, they received a reply letter from Mr. So-and-so agreeing to the loan. The exchange of letters is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Agreeing to Lend 100,000 <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>(Above omitted) Upon receiving your association's letter requesting a loan of 100,000 yuan, I have discussed it with Brother Yousheng in person. 50,000 yuan will be temporarily borrowed from the China &amp; South Sea Bank, and the remaining 50,000 yuan will be borrowed from my company. In this way, it will not be necessary to borrow from the public banking industry. Please complete the necessary procedures and use the funds at any time.</p>

We are deeply grateful and admire your company's and the China &amp; South Sea Bank's willingness to each provide half of the 100,000 yuan relief loan, enabling us to rush to save the disaster victims. We are sending staff to present two formal IOUs from our Association, each for 50,000 yuan. Please check and forward them to your company and the China &amp; South Sea Bank for safekeeping, and exchange them for passbooks, deposit books, checkbooks, signature cards, etc. A special announcement of gratitude, wishing you well."</p>

<p>The Police Training Institute, formerly run by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was forced to suspend operations due to economic difficulties after the January 28th Incident. Now, recognizing the necessity of restoring the Institute, a restoration plan has been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e113">International Trade Bureau Compiles and Prints the China Industry Journal <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province Has Already Been Published</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's National Trade Bureau has compiled a national industry journal, starting with Jiangsu Province, as reported in previous news. It is now learned that the China Industry Journal of Jiangsu Province has been compiled, printed, and published today. The book contains two million words, totaling over two thousand four hundred pages. This magnificent work is rich in materials and exquisitely bound. The reporter believes that this matter is still an innovation in our country, and the compilation of the industry journal is unprecedented and of great importance. Therefore, I went to the International Trade Bureau to inquire about everything and met with Mr. Hou Houpei, the Director of Investigation in charge of this matter. Mr. Hou kindly informed me of various details. This investigation, thanks to the enthusiasm and supervision of Minister Chen and Director He, proceeded without delay during the implementation period, so it was able to complete this heavy and massive work in a very short time. There are several points that urgently need to be explained at the time of publication: (1) The purpose of this investigation is entirely to promote industry, so the selection of materials also focuses on the production and sales aspects, so its purpose is also mainly for general reference, rather than for professional research. (2) Although the investigation materials are novel, they seem to only be useful for people outside the industry to refer to, and the reference materials for people in the industry may feel insufficient. (3) Economic conditions are constantly changing, and the industries in Jiangsu are too numerous to mention, and the various industries that have not been added will be added in the future using the addendum method. (4) The time period for the investigation and collection of materials is within three months, from September to November of the 21st year of the Republic of China, which is quite unified. Comparative observation can also be in line with the principles. However, the investigation and compilation periods are very short, but colleagues have strictly reviewed the data and proofreading, and have tried their best to ask experts to proofread and correct them, and dare not be negligent. As for errors, it is inevitable, and I hope that all sectors will give instructions, etc.</p>

<p>The case of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory in this port causing an accident that injured and killed several people has only been four or five days, and the tragedy of the Zhabei Yonghe Rubber Factory's boiler explosion due to electrical leakage has occurred again. The Municipal Government has paid close attention to this and will immediately order the Social Bureau to quickly investigate and report the cause of the accident and the factory's usual management situation within a specified period, and instruct the bureau to strictly inspect other factories in the city to avoid disasters and value human life.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Bureau plans to operate cross-river ferries to Pudong, designating two locations: the Copper Statue Wharf and the Avenue Edward VII Wharf. The bureau previously ordered two ferries from foreign merchants, both of which have been completed and are already operating on the cross-river ferry route at the Copper Statue Wharf. As for the Avenue Edward VII Wharf cross-river ferry, because the Pudong Youlong Wharf is still under construction, it will be able to sail as soon as it is completed.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reported that the port authorities announced yesterday (the 27th) that three new buoys have been added to the Huangpu River, all of which can be completed and available for use tomorrow (the 1st). Their locations are all near the Xigou downstream of the Mei Zi Shipyard, providing mooring positions for four ships. Two of them can accommodate the largest imported ships, and the remaining two can accommodate medium-sized ocean-going ships. In the future, there will be 55 mooring positions with buoys in the Huangpu River, all under the management of the Customs, of which three are dedicated to Customs patrol boats, two are dedicated to fishing boats, and three are dedicated to fishing vessels. The remaining 47 are for ocean-going and coastal ships to anchor. In addition, there are five mooring positions owned by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and seven owned by the Jiangnan Shipyard. At present, the largest imported ships can reach a draft of 32 feet, but such giant ships are rarely imported. The new buoys can accommodate giant ships with a draft of 30 feet. According to reports, the current buoys in the Huangpu River were equipped by the Customs in early 1921. Before that, they were only privately owned. Subsequently, in 1926, the positions of the buoys were rearranged, and in 1928, the number of buoys was increased to facilitate navigation. Recently, three more buoys have been added, and at the same time, the old buoys have been replaced with new-style buoys, and 12 have been replaced to date.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Stamp Duty Issue on Car Signature Slips <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Strives to Waive the Fine</p>
<p>The cases of the Xiangsheng and Lili car companies in this city having their time signature slips confiscated by the stamp duty inspection office and ordered to be fined have caused resentment among merchants and citizens who believe the fines are inappropriate. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Letter from the Car Industry to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Car Industry Association's letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce states:</p>
<p>"Respectfully, regarding the matter of the time counting signature slips used by the industry, on the 10th and 15th of this month, the Concession Cigarette Inspection Office, together with the police patrol team, confiscated the time counting signature slips, etc. On the 14th, we sent a letter to your chamber to forward to the Jiangsu Stamp Duty Bureau to cancel the stamp duty on the signature slips and to quickly return the confiscated slips to maintain business, etc. However, more than ten days have passed, and they have not been returned. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 a.m. today, police lawyer Ru Bao Yi filed a lawsuit for violation of regulations. The Ninth Court ruled that Lili Car Company should be fined 1,000 yuan, Xiangsheng Car Company should be fined 1,000 yuan, and Xinzha Car Company should be fined 300 yuan, and that all signature slips used by the industry in the future must be fully stamped, completely disregarding the instructions issued by the Shanghai Special Zone Office of the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Duty Bureau on June 9, 1931, which stated that stamping was exempt. The police lawyer's one-sided statement was accepted, and the ruling was made. Such a discrepancy in tax policy is unbearable for merchants and citizens. The industry is trembling in this situation. Moreover, the industry follows the regulations of the Ministry of Industry to prepare time counting signature slips, which do not resemble receipt of money in any way, and there is no regulation or item that requires full stamping. If this precedent is set, the Datang Car Company will need to stamp about 10,000 yuan or more each year, and small car companies will also need to stamp several thousand yuan. At a time when businesses are losing money, how can they bear such a heavy burden? The industry will inevitably close down one after another. If they do not follow the judgment and stamp receipts, they will inevitably be inspected and fined one by one. There are many people in the industry, and their hearts are not united. If they become indignant and an accident occurs, it may cause unrest in society. Based on these facts, the Association dares to send a letter to your chamber, urging you to telegraph the Ministry of Finance and order the Taxation Department to stop inspecting the industry's signature slips. This matter concerns the survival of the industry, so a corresponding letter is sent, hoping that you will investigate and handle it accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e118">Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Telegram to the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's telegram to the Ministry of Finance states: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: The main point of this case is that the signature slip is not a similar item in the stamp duty regulations that can be compared for stamping. Therefore, on June 1, 1931, the Special Zone Office had instructions not to stamp signature slips that were not for receipt of money. Although the Special Zone Office's handling of violation cases has been transferred to the Cigarette Consolidated Tax Inspection Office, how can the previous approved exemption be completely erased due to changes in jurisdiction? If government offices do not follow the established regulations, what can merchants and citizens do? These circumstances were reported to you in a telegram on the 15th of this month. Based on the previous situation, in addition to the three cases that have been judged and fined, which will be handled separately by the parties concerned according to law, it is proposed that your ministry order the Consolidated Tax Department to maintain the original case of exempting signature counting slips from stamp duty, so as to prevent the Inspection Office from making arbitrary and unreasonable demands. This is for the public benefit. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce humbly requests."</p>
<h3 id="e119">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Letter to the Municipal Government to Prevent the Blocking of the Laiyi Ferry Wharf <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of submitting a letter, on the 25th of this month, the Pudong Branch Office of the Association stated, 'The Laiyi Ferry crossing in Pudong is the main road for the entry and exit of goods in the entire town, and there is no other way. A few days ago, it was about to be blocked. More than 40 rice shops, including Ertai Rice Shop, jointly requested it. On the 4th of this month, we submitted a letter to your association to forward to the Municipal Government for prompt relief. It has been half a month since then, and no instructions have been received. This morning, the ferry crossing was suddenly blocked by Hongsheng Warehouse, causing the flow of goods between Pudong and the West to be completely cut off. The public was extremely agitated and planned to go on a passive strike to resist. Upon hearing the news, the office immediately dissuaded them and waited quietly for a solution, and rushed to the Third District Office of the Public Security Bureau to contact Director Zhang. Director Zhang agreed to persuade the compradore of the warehouse to temporarily remove the wooden stakes and report to the manager for approval. Commercial prosperity depends entirely on smooth sources and convenient transportation. After the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, all industries were depressed and operating miserably, and they were just hoping to recover. However, the ferry crossing is blocked, and the source of goods is cut off. The municipal ferry wharf is only for pedestrians and does not allow loading and unloading of goods. Therefore, there is no other way out. All the shops will inevitably close their doors one after another, and the bustling streets will become dead ends. Our municipal government is working hard on construction and seeking the revitalization of the entire city. It must not regard Laiyi Ferry Town as being outside the sphere of influence. The matter is urgent, and we have no choice but to submit another letter to your association, requesting that you quickly forward it to the Municipal Government, taking into account the public interest, and clearly ordering that the ferry crossing be open forever. The 100,000 residents of our entire town pledge to be the government's backing and to deal with those who only care about their own selfish interests.' The letter has been received by the Association. Regarding this matter, according to the letter from the branch office, we submitted a letter to your government on the 6th of this month, requesting that the Hongsheng Company not block the public wharf for Chinese merchants. Now, according to the follow-up report, it is not known whether the company has not received the order from your government to stop the blocking, or whether it intends to show contempt. It is difficult to speculate. However, it is inappropriate for a public wharf for commercial loading and unloading to be blocked by a private company in terms of law and business. For the sake of the public interest, we urgently need to take appropriate measures, otherwise, the public will be disturbed and disputes will arise with the company, which may hinder local order. We are submitting another letter to your government for your review and approval, urgently requesting that you investigate and handle the previous case and order a stop to maintain public transportation. We await your orders."</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Charity Federation Continues to Send Letters to All Sectors Requesting Donations for Shelters for the Poor <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yiting, chairman of the Shanghai Charity Federation, believing that the shelters for the poor are facing financial difficulties and urgently need relief, sent letters to the Inland Water Company, Chinese Merchants Electric Company, Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Zhang Xiaoliang, and other philanthropists, requesting them to find ways to donate. The original letter stated, "Respectfully, the shelters for the poor run by our association have received generous donations from you for many years, benefiting the poor and needy, and we are deeply grateful. The number of people sheltered this year is even greater than before, while the donations are very few. We have already sent a letter to you, requesting your donation. We hope you will understand. Currently, the spring cold is still severe, and there are still more than 1,800 poor people being sheltered. More than 12 dan of rice are needed every day. It is estimated that the various expenses until the end of March will be greatly insufficient. Therefore, we are sending another letter, respectfully hoping that you will generously donate so that we can maintain operations. We await your kind response with the utmost gratitude." It is heard that the associations that have agreed to donate include Guangyi Charity Hall, which will continue to donate 300 yuan, philanthropist Wang Yiting, who will donate 100 yuan, Shanghai Public Hospital, which will donate 800 taels of anti-addiction pills, and Xin Cheng Company, which will donate 90 steamed buns.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Development of the Sacred Heart Hospital <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Adding a Radium Treatment Center, Maternity Hospital, and Outpatient Department</p>
<p>Its Various Facilities Can Be Called the Best in China</p>
<p>Shen Lu Bohong, Song Hancao, Le Zhenbao, Feng Bingnan, and others founded the Sacred Heart Hospital on Ningguo Road in Yangshupu. The hospital site covers more than 60 mu, and has four cement ward buildings, each of which can accommodate 150 people, divided into first, second, third, and fourth class, with both men and women admitted. Since its opening ten years ago, it has achieved remarkable results. All patients who have sought treatment have expressed satisfaction with the medical treatment and nursing care. In addition to treating nearby poor people who have suffered falls, cuts, burns, etc., without charge, free clinics are held every afternoon, reaching 500 to 600 people. Recently, under the careful planning of Hospital Director Lu Bohong, Hospital Affairs Director Lu Yingeng, and Medical Director Song Wusheng, the hospital has made even greater progress. A radium treatment center has recently been added, and all radium treatment equipment has been purchased, worth more than 200,000 yuan, specializing in the treatment of gastric cancer, scrofula, and other difficult and complicated diseases such as internal and external tumors, all of which have immediate and miraculous effects. This is a newly invented medical weapon, and it is still the only one in China. There are also two large and small X-ray machines with extremely strong therapeutic power. At the same time, Director Lu, in view of the fact that there is still a lack of maternity hospitals in the eastern part of Shanghai, and in response to the requests of local people, has specially added a maternity hospital, hiring obstetrician gynecologists to be responsible for delivery, and purchasing a number of sanitary vehicles for patients to use at any time. For the sake of general benefit, it has been decided that, starting from March 1, an outpatient department will be established for internal and external medicine and other departments. The doctors who will take turns in charge of diagnosis and treatment, such as Medical Director Shi Deli, Song Wusheng, internal and external medicine doctors Pan Weicen, Shi Demin, radium X-ray director Ge Chengzhi, Zhang Youmei, specially invited doctors Xie Bi, the Boro siblings, Mude, Bumei, Engel, Xie Yingrui, Huang Fei, Liu Zunzhi, Chen Bangyu, etc., are all leaders in the Chinese and Western medical circles in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangyin Guild Hall prepared seventeen coffins and separately collected the workers who were burned to death, with five pieces of silk burial clothing and one quilt each, temporarily placing them on the open space in the factory, waiting for the court to examine them before putting them into coffins. At 4:00 p.m., the local court dispatched Prosecutor Ouyang Tao to rush to examine the bodies separately, and then the Jiangyin Guild Hall collected them, and the bereaved families received them. As for those who have not been claimed, they will be temporarily housed by the Jiangyin Guild Hall at Pushan Villa for claim. At the same time, the company set up a reception center for the bereaved families yesterday and received representatives of each family to discuss the solution. The affected workers will probably be compensated 600 yuan each according to the Factory Law, and a memorial service for the deceased workers will be held regularly in the No. 1 factory. The circumstances of the incident will be reported to the Social Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Company Report <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Yonghe Industrial Company submitted a report to the Social Bureau yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of reporting the cause of the factory fire, please review and approve: Our company has a factory located at the end of Xibaoxing Road and Minsheng Road in Zhabei, manufacturing cosmetics and rubber products. During the January 28th Incident last year, the front part of the factory was destroyed by artillery fire. In order to maintain the livelihood of the workers, we immediately repaired and started work in the remaining bungalows. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 a.m. on the 27th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the rubber department's drying room. Before we could notice, the steam cylinder in the drying room had become heated and exploded, causing the house to collapse. A small number of workers who did not have time to escape were tragically affected. All the injured have been sent to the hospital for treatment. Our company's factory equipment has been investigated and recorded by your bureau, but we did not expect the disaster to come unexpectedly. Our company has suffered greatly from the destruction of the violent Japanese, and we have been operating painstakingly, but we have not even restored one-tenth. Unexpectedly, we have encountered another accident, and we are particularly saddened by the affected workers. We are now trying to handle the aftermath and compensation. All the circumstances of the fire are hereby reported. Please review and record."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Party and Government Investigation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau dispatched Tian Heqing, director of the factory inspection division, and Li Chong, et al., to conduct an investigation for verification. Also yesterday at 11:00 AM, the Municipal Party Headquarters sent Zhao Erchang, an officer from the civil training section, to investigate the truth. Afterward, Director Tian of the Social Affairs Bureau discussed the incident, saying that after the factory disaster occurred, the bureau immediately dispatched factory inspectors Li Chongpu and others to investigate. According to reports, the cause of the accident was similar to that of the Zhengtai Factory, also due to the burning of "xi silin" (likely a phonetic transliteration of "xylene") in the coating room. The air temperature in the steam room, which adjoined the coating room, and the air pressure inside the cylinder suddenly increased several times, causing it to explode. There were originally seventeen workers in the coating room, three of whom died instantly because they could not escape. The canvas shoe factory on the side of the steam cylinder room collapsed due to the strong vibration of the steam cylinder, crushing fourteen female workers to death and injuring more than twenty. Yesterday, one male worker died in the hospital due to severe injuries. Apart from ten who were hospitalized, the other slightly injured workers have all been discharged. It was found that the factory's equipment had been inspected by the bureau's factory inspectors on November 17th. At that time, the canvas shoe section had not yet started work, but the safety equipment on the steam cylinder was relatively complete, and the inspectors strictly instructed the factory to handle it properly to prevent explosions. This steam cylinder explosion was not due to the poor safety equipment of the steam cylinder itself, but because the temperature around the outside of the steam cylinder suddenly increased, and the air pressure inside the steam cylinder increased accordingly, leading to the explosion, which was very unfortunate. For the sake of convenience, rubber factories in the city often combine coating and steaming work in one room, which makes it easy for the xylene used in coating to catch fire and cause the steam cylinder to explode. To avoid similar disasters, the coating room and the steam cylinder room should be completely separated, and workshops should not be set up on the upper floor of the steam cylinder room. Fortunately, the steam cylinder room of the Yongru Factory was a single-story building, otherwise, this tragedy would have been even more serious than the Zhengtai Factory incident. However, in order to reduce the chance of fire in the xylene used in the coating room, the design of the coating oil drums urgently needs to be improved. The bureau has drafted measures to improve the safety problems of rubber factories in the city and will order all factories to comply with them.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Huang Baohua Released from Kidnapping <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Held in Bandit Den for Two Weeks</p>
<p>Huang Baohua, an accountant at the Ruikang Pigment Company on Shandong Road in the Shanghai International Settlement, was kidnapped by bandits at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Grollier in the French Concession on the evening of the 12th of this month. It is now heard that Huang returned home safely from the bandit den yesterday morning at about 5:00 AM. In total, he was kidnapped for more than two weeks. Huang is a native of Jiangyin, 50 years old, and has worked as an accountant at Ruikang for many years. He lives at No. 25 Rue Grollier in the French Concession. At about 7:00 PM on the evening of the 12th of this month, Huang returned from a spring banquet at a friend's house. While riding in a chartered car through the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Grollier, he was suddenly dragged down by three or four bandits and forced into a car that had been parked on the side of the road, and driven away. Only this morning was he able to escape.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Dock Coolies Brawl, Causing Trouble <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Gao Zuoqiao Dies Tragically</p>
<p>There is a gang of "wild chicken" coolies on the Pudong Company's dock, all from Hubei province. In addition to working as laborers, they also make a living by smuggling "swept-package" goods (i.e., goods that evade taxes). Yesterday afternoon, Gao Zuoqiao and his gang appropriated some smuggled goods, and did not share the profits, which was questioned by Chen Guiqing and others on the opposing side. A conflict ensued, resulting in a brawl resembling a械斗 (xie dou, a large-scale clan fight). Gao Zuoqiao was the target of the crowd, and suffered injuries all over his body, immediately falling unconscious. The Third District Police Department dispatched police officers to arrest Chen Guiqing, Ji Jinkui, Wang Daosheng, Wu Luhou, Liu Ali, and others. The injured person was carried to the Baolong Hospital for treatment by his elder brother, Gao Zuoying. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died this morning. The Third District Police Department was immediately notified and the defendants were transferred to the local court. At the same time, the local bailiff was ordered to report to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Russian Woman Found to Have Died from Miscarriage and Peritonitis <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Russian woman, Akos Danuo, also known as Anasia Danxue Yin Nuo Kai Dinaxie Ke Ning, residing at No. 47 Tangshan Road, died from a miscarriage at Hongen Hospital on the 24th of this month. The body was sent to the Feilun Autopsy Institute by the Huishan Patrol Room, where the First Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, to inspect the body and order a rescheduled autopsy. This information has already been recorded in this newspaper. Forensic Doctor Wei of the First Special Court, along with doctors from the Public Works Department, dissected the body, and the result was that the deceased died from miscarriage and peritonitis. Yesterday morning, the period for re-examination arrived again, and Prosecutor Guo and forensic doctors arrived at the autopsy institute again. According to the report of the Western Detective Meng Aisi, according to the report of the doctor Huotuoliede (likely a phonetic transliteration) of the Public Charity Hospital, the deceased went to the hospital on the fourth day with internal bleeding, and was discharged on the eleventh day. On the fifteenth, I went to her home, and the next day, the deceased went to the hospital again and suddenly had a miscarriage. At that time, only the nurse was there, and the placenta had not been delivered and the bleeding did not stop. The next day, I took her bag down, causing my finger to rupture the woman's blood vessels. On the fourth day after delivery, she developed peritonitis. The deceased's poison gas did not spread, and her life could still be saved. Surgery was also feared to cause death. The Russian midwife Boerhuotuo (likely a phonetic transliteration) also testified that she was 42 years old, residing at No. 19, Lane 166, Mao Hai Road. I no longer work in this profession and have relied on my husband for more than two years. I did not perform an abortion for the deceased. On December 15 last year, the deceased came to ask if I could perform an abortion, and I immediately refused to see her. The report was obtained, and it was concluded that the deceased Russian woman Akos Danuo died from a miscarriage and peritonitis. The body was handed over to the Health Department of the Public Works Department for coffin preparation.</p>

<p>Hu Xu Has Other Intentions</p>
<p>Hu Lianyuan Has a Clear Conscience</p>
<p>Hu Xu, a native of Ningbo residing at No. 400, Rixin Lane, Tangshan Road, previously hired a lawyer in the First Special District Court to accuse Hu Lianyuan, an employee of the Weiren Foreign Company, of abducting her 18-year-old daughter, Hu Lingzhen, and filed a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay alimony of 20,000 yuan in one lump sum. The Special Court had summoned him once, but because the accuser did not arrive, it was adjourned to a later date. It is now learned that the defendant, Hu Lianyuan, has also hired lawyer Aiyafu to submit a statement and file a countersuit for false accusation. The original statement vaguely stated that the defendant was formally engaged to Ms. Du Lingzhen on the tenth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar last year through the introduction of Hu Dingjia and Ke Niangniang, and with the consent of both parents. (Lingzhen was originally surnamed Du, her biological father died early, and her mother remarried, so Hu Benwei, so her surname is Hu.) At that time, the matchmaker sent a betrothal gift of 220 yuan. On the fourteenth day of the eleventh month of the year, both parents invited Pastor Yu Zhizhai to officiate the wedding at Jinglin Church on Kunshan Road. In the evening, a banquet was held at the Dazhonghua Restaurant, and female relatives such as Lu Shun'e and Ma Rumei also attended the wedding banquet. However, the day before the wedding, the plaintiff wanted to extort a gift of 100 yuan, but the defendant only gave 50 yuan, which did not meet her wishes, and she held a grudge in her heart. She refused to sign the marriage certificate, but was later reconciled. On the thirteenth of this month, the plaintiff reported to the Huishan Patrol Room that the defendant had abducted her daughter, hoping to take advantage of the defendant. Because the defendant had nothing to hide, he went to the patrol room with Lingzhen to confront her. After investigation by the patrol room, it was determined that the defendant and Lingzhen were indeed formally married and there was no abduction. The plaintiff was reprimanded, but the plaintiff became angry and entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit. It was found that all the allegations made by the plaintiff were false. It was also found that the plaintiff made false accusations intending to subject others to criminal punishment, which constitutes the crime of false accusation under Article 180 of the Criminal Code. It should be declared that the defendant is innocent and the plaintiff should be punished for false accusation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the Eighth Criminal Court to summon the defendant and Hu Lingzhen. Ms. Hu was fair-skinned, petite and exquisite, wearing a printed cheongsam, a short coat, silk stockings and leather shoes, and her hair was loose. She sat in the audience, calm and smiling from time to time. The plaintiff, Hu Xu, claimed to be 38 years old. I married at the age of 19, and my husband died the following May. In August, I remarried Hu Benwei. Lingzhen was born to my previous husband. She studied and grew up in Fengtian. Unexpectedly, Lingzhen ran away on November 8 last year, and I later learned that she was abducted by the defendant, so I filed a lawsuit. Questioning the defendant, he confessed that Hu Dingjia and Liu Niangniang acted as matchmakers to the plaintiff and paid a gift of 220 yuan. Later, they formally married at Jinglin Church and invited Yu Zhizhai to officiate the wedding. He presented the red wedding certificate to the court. The rest of his confession was the same as his statement, omitted. According to Hu Lingzhen, she agreed to marry Hu Lianyuan this time with her mother's consent, and the matchmaker brought a gift of 220 yuan. Judge Wu verified the confessions and declared to the plaintiff that according to modern criminal law, as long as men and women are over 16 years old, agree to each other, and have the introduction of two or more people, it becomes effective. The consent of the parents is not a problem. Now that the defendant has submitted a formal marriage certificate, it is naturally considered legal. Therefore, before the start of the debate, he can withdraw the case and file a lawsuit in the civil court. However, the plaintiff stubbornly refused to understand, so the lawyer debated to the end. Judge Wu ruled Hu Lianyuan not guilty.</p>

<p>Jin Jiulin, supervisor of the special agency of the French Patrol Room, detective Hong Ziying, private detective Qin Youyu, and others, arrested five bandits in Room 340 of the Asia Hotel, No. 340 Avenue Edward VII, at 5:00 AM on the 15th of last month: Hua Yunlong (also known as the coolie A Mao), Lu Hongquan, Wang Ruijin, Lu Quangen, and Shi A'gen. They seized a pistol and six bullets, and found out that the bandits had robbed the home of Jin Xiaofan, a native of Anhui, at No. 1 Yiheli, Beile Road, on the night of January 3, shooting and killing the victim. They were sent to the Second Special District Court to file a public prosecution, interrogate, and investigate, as reported in previous newspapers. The detectives have now found that the bandits first colluded with Zhang Hongshan, Yang Yonglin, and others who are at large to rob Zhang Qinzhou, a bill collector of the French Electric Light Company at No. 325 Annakin Road, Xu Ansheng's meat shop at No. 72 Bair Road, and Xu Wanmin's home at No. 11 Xinkangli, Mafang Street, and have recorded their confessions. Yesterday, they were sent to the court again. In the afternoon, Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. First, lawyer Gu Shouxi of the Patrol Room stated the Patrol Room's investigation situation, and the victim's widow, Jin Wangshi, recounted the situation of her husband Jin Xiaofan's murder, requesting a thorough investigation to avenge her husband's death. Then, the victims recounted the process of being robbed. Hua Yunlong confessed that Zhang Hongshan, who was at large, had the idea, and colluded with the people on trial and Yang Yonglin, who was at large, to rob Jin Xiaofan's home. I was watching the wind outside the door and shared the loot. Lu Zhang and others went inside to rob and shot the victim. The four robbers Wang, Lu, and Shi also confessed to robbing the homes of the victims together and jointly hired lawyer Zhu Yonglie for defense. The court ordered a rescheduled trial. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>The abandoned small steamer "New Sielge" is docked on the Huangpu River at Guangxing Wharf. Liu Zhisheng, a native of Ningbo, was hired to watch the boat. Liu lived there with his family, including Liu's wife, Liu Luo, 34 years old, a six-year-old daughter, and his son Chengcai, who was just nine months old. Because they lived and ate there, there was always a coal stove in the cabin. The day before yesterday afternoon, Liu Luo bought a few fish, slaughtered and ate them, and went to sleep with her two children. Liu himself had other work to do. When he returned home at dawn, he found his wife and two children lying stiff in the cabin. The charcoal fire in the stove had not gone out. He quickly dragged them out to the dock. The girl was rescued and woke up, but his wife and others were already dead. He immediately reported to the Water Patrol Room, and Detective Qu and two doctors went inside to investigate. The room was full of foul gas, which made people nauseous. It was impossible to determine whether the deceased died from coal poisoning or from poisoning from the fish they had eaten.

<p>Yin A'xiang Remarried Twice After Becoming a Widow</p>
<p>Small Ruffian Jealous of Adultery, Opens Fire and Kills Coppersmith</p>
<p>At about 7:00 AM yesterday morning, an assassination occurred at the entrance of Xinle Lane, Milu Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession. The victim was a coppersmith, who died immediately. The murderer was a hooligan who escaped on the spot. The motive for the murder was a love rivalry. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Widow Remarries <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>There is a woman surnamed Yin from Shaoxing, named A'xiang, who is now 25 years old. At the age of 17, she was married to Wang Yongzhao, a farmer from the same village, by her parents. Not long after, Wang suddenly died of illness, leaving behind a son named Zhigang. Ms. Yin became a widow at a young age, and her parents' family was poor. She had no choice but to bring her young son to Shanghai to seek refuge with relatives and make a living. However, after arriving in Shanghai, she was alone and unable to make a living. Later, a person surnamed Chen acted as a matchmaker, and she remarried to Wang Xitang, also from the same village. Wang is 36 years old this year, has no occupation, and is actually a rogue hooligan.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Encountering the Wrong Person <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>After Yin married Wang, she did not expect Wang to be a libertine. As time went by, she realized that she had been deceived, but she only resigned herself to her fate and cried secretly. Unexpectedly, in less than a year, Wang treated her like old shoes, adding "xiachu" (likely a reference to physical punishment). Wang had an old father named Wang Wenkui, who never approved of what Xitang had done. Ms. Yin often complained to Wang's father, asking for help.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Remarriage Midway <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Wang Wenkui, knowing that Xitang of the Zhi Xitang family was inherently violent, strongly advised Ms. Yin to find a way to divorce him. At the time, Xitang actually demanded a price of one thousand yuan, which was eventually reduced to four hundred yuan. Both parties agreed that the man and woman were free to marry and remarry as they pleased. This took place in the late tenth lunar month of last year. After the two parties severed ties, Ms. Yin soon became acquainted with a coppersmith named Peng Quanbao. Peng was twenty-four years old, originally from the Lvsi area, and currently worked at Yongtai Metal Casting Factory on Six Ma Road, living together with Ms. Yin.</p>
<p>After Ms. Yin and Peng became intimate, she, along with her eight-year-old son Zhigang, rented Room 6 in Xinle Lane, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, on the upper floor, western middle room, of Yao Yongji Electroplating Factory (rent of nine yuan per month) to live together. Peng's second elder brother, Miaoqi, worked as a foreman at Yao Yongji, and his eldest brother, Miaolin, was currently an employee at a certain metal workshop at Hongqiao Tou in the Nanshi district, having returned to his hometown on business a few days ago. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning at 7:15 AM, Peng got up and went to the tiger stove at the Milu Road intersection to get hot water. Just as he reached the alley entrance, Ms. Yin's ex-husband, Wang Xitang, who had been lying in wait, saw Peng and immediately drew a pistol, aiming at Peng's head and firing two shots. One bullet hit the left temple, and the other hit the upper lip. Peng immediately fell to the ground, blood gushing like a fountain. At the same time, Yao Yongji's colleagues, hearing the alarm, rushed out, but the assailant had already fled without a trace. Peng died from his serious injuries.</p>
<p>Ms. Yin immediately reported to the police station. The police chief sent detectives to investigate. They first rushed Quanbao to Renji Hospital, but because the injuries were to vital areas, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The hospital notified the police station, and the Tongren Fuyuan branch ordered undertakers to carry the body for examination and report to the Second Special District Court for inspection. The police are now strictly investigating the assailant and will punish him according to the law.</p>
<p>Two Fellow Associations Request Negotiation on Cross-Border Arrest and Murder Case</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Fellow Association and the Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association's Committee for Aiding the Zhu Case held their first meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 PM at their meeting place at the intersection of Zang Road and Edward Road. More than twenty people attended. After detailed discussion of methods for punishing the murderer and providing compensation, several resolutions were passed on the spot. It was also decided to send telegrams to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan of the National Government, requesting that the Shanghai Municipal Government be ordered to seriously negotiate with the French Consulate in Shanghai to uphold the value of human life and enforce the law. The meeting adjourned at 7 PM. The petition is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The association received a petition from fellow villager Zhu Guhan, stating that his younger brother, Zhu Guting, a native of Chaoyang, aged twenty, was a shop assistant at Renhe Store on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. On the afternoon of the 21st of this month at 1:45 PM, while passing by the Ningbo Restaurant on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, he was caught in a crowd being dispersed by cross-border police firing guns. Zhu Guting was unable to escape and was shot in the chest, dying on the spot. His elderly parents and young wife and children are left behind. He pleaded for assistance to right the wrong.</p>
<p>The association's investigation division sent Xu Dianming to investigate the scene. Xu reported that he visited the area near the Ningbo Restaurant on Xinqiao Street and inquired with various shops, who all stated that at 1:45 PM on the 25th of this month, a police officer No. 427 interfered with two women riding in a rickshaw, arguing with them for violating traffic regulations. A crowd of passersby gathered to watch, and the police officer then fired several shots into the crowd, killing Zhu Guting on the spot and wounding Liu Fugao and one other unidentified person. Liu Fugao also died that evening from his injuries. The bodies of both were examined yesterday (i.e., the 16th) at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall by a prosecutor from the Second Special District Court. Zhu Guting was shot in the chest and back, and Liu Fugao was shot through the abdomen. The two unidentified individuals were wounded in their hands and feet and were treated at the hospital. The incident was reported as such.</p>
<p>The cross-border police interfered with two women riding in a car and, seeing a large crowd of onlookers, arbitrarily fired shots to disperse the crowd, firing several shots and killing and wounding many people. This is an abuse of power, a deliberate killing. If this case is not severely punished, citizens will be in danger at any time and in any place. We urgently request the relevant departments to negotiate swiftly with the French Concession authorities, ensuring that the culprit is punished according to the law, that the deceased's family is generously compensated, and that guarantees are made that such incidents will not occur again. We pray that human life will be valued and security will be guaranteed.</p>
<p>The Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association,</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Association</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Association's letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association states:</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that our fellow villager Liu Qinglai has stated that his nephew, Ke Fugao, a native of Cixi, aged thirty-nine, was a clerk at Yuantaiheng Sugar Store on Yangxing Street. On the afternoon of the 25th of this month, while passing through Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, he was unexpectedly shot in the abdomen by a French Concession security guard without cause, immediately collapsing unconscious. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment but died. Liu Qinglai, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene, but was too late to see him one last time. Ke Fugao's family is poor, with an elderly mother over sixty and a wife and children waiting to be fed. We plead for assistance to comfort his soul.</p>
<p>The cross-border police officer fired shots in broad daylight on a busy street, killing and wounding many people, showing a disregard for human life. In light of the aforementioned, in addition to informing the Second Special District Court of the French Concession to handle the matter according to the law, we hereby write to your association to request assistance, to promptly and seriously negotiate with the French Concession Municipal Council, demanding severe punishment for the murderer, generous compensation for the deceased's family, and guarantees that similar incidents will not occur in the future. We have always admired your association's concern for the safety of citizens and believe that you will share our outrage over this unfortunate event. We hope you will take appropriate action.</p>

<p>Expansion of the Second Special District Court</p>
<p>The Second Special District Court of the French Concession has recently experienced a large increase in civil and criminal cases. The original six courtrooms are insufficient, and the office space at 4 Hozhi Lane across the street is too small. Therefore, the court has requested the French Municipal Council to lease the council's three-story Western-style building at 16 Xuehuali Road (i.e., the residence of the former head of the Western Prison, next door to the court along the road). After the council approved, the court hired craftsmen to renovate the building. Once completed, two courtrooms will be set up downstairs, and the prosecutor's office and judicial police office will be moved to the second floor. The third floor will still be used by the Municipal Council as an office for the judicial advisor, moving the judicial advisor's office and the police lawyer's office currently located inside the Municipal Council at Dazimingzhong to that location for convenience. Furthermore, the current French Municipal Council judicial advisor, Mr. Duna (translator), has returned to his country for vacation and relinquished his position, to be replaced by Mr. Jadang (translator, former assistant judge of the French Court), who has returned to Shanghai from his home country.</p>
<p>Planning for Pudong Water Plant</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Plans to Find Other Ways</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has long planned to develop the Pudong area and build a water plant. The site for the plant has also been selected. The reason for the delay is due to the municipal government's financial difficulties. According to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, they originally planned to start construction by the end of last year, but due to the weakened post-war economy, municipal revenue has decreased, while expenditures have increased. As a result, the plan could not be realized. Moreover, the current price of gold has risen sharply, and the cost of purchasing machinery has greatly increased compared to the original budget. According to recent statistics, it would cost no less than 300,000 yuan to start construction. However, the development of the Pudong area cannot be delayed. Therefore, it has been decided to find other ways to start construction as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Huangpu Steamer Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>The Company Asked the Authorities to Send People to Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>The Huangpu steamer of the British Swire Company's Yangtze River route had a dispute over the company's desire to reduce the number of third-class crew members on the ship. After several negotiations by party and government agencies, the company seemed willing to make some concessions regarding the number of personnel. The ship arrived at noon at half-past twelve yesterday, and docked at Laiyi Ferry in Pudong, scheduled to sail to Hankou on March 2nd. It is reported that the company has sent a letter to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau, requesting that they send people to go and negotiate again today, while the Huangpu crew members are still staying on the ship, taking a stand not to sacrifice themselves.</p>

<p>Wang Jingchu Committed Suicide</p>
<p>Wang Jingchu, an old clerk from Pudong, aged fifty-nine, at Dachang Silk Store, No. 3 Mingguo Road, Xiaodongmen, had worked in the store for a long time. Wang was frugal and had no vices. Suddenly, at about 2 AM yesterday morning, he committed suicide by hanging himself on the staircase railing inside the back door of the store. His colleague Zhao Yunsheng discovered him when he got up to urinate downstairs in the early morning. He shouted in alarm, and all the staff of the store were awakened. They immediately notified Wang's family and reported to Liu Yunfang, the chief of the Second Division of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who sent Patrol Officer Li to investigate and ordered the local guarantor Wang Jurong to report to the local court. At about 5 PM yesterday afternoon, the prosecutor of the court conducted an autopsy with the autopsy officer.</p>
<p>Woman from Yutan Accuses Aunt and Younger Uncle of Defamation</p>
<p>The woman Yao Xiuying, whose husband Gao Jinzhang used to run a fish stall at the Xiakou vegetable market, had saved some money and had a seven-year-old son. Last year, Gao suddenly fell ill and died. Yao Xiuying continued to run the fish stall. Yao Xiuying's aunt, Gao Liu, and younger uncle, Gao Arui, coveted Yao's fish stall and savings and repeatedly forced her to remarry and tried to drive her out. They used various methods to falsely accuse Yao of misconduct. Feeling wronged by this insult, she hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Gao Liu and Gao Arui for defamation, requesting that they be punished according to the criminal law for harming her reputation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the Special District Court opened the court to summon the defendants. According to Gao Yao, since her husband's death, even before the mourning period of two sevens (fourteen days) was over, her aunt and uncle abused her, intending to drive her out of the house and forcing her to remarry, and falsely accusing her of having a lover and renting a small house to serve as grounds for driving her out. The neighbors are aware of this matter, but they are afraid of the defendants' violence and dare not testify in court. The two defendants denied the aforementioned allegations. The court then ordered the commencement of arguments, and after lawyer Yang's arguments, Judge Liu ordered that a date be set for sentencing.</p>
<p>Kalachakra Dharma Assembly Gave Souvenir Badges</p>
<p>Please Return the Fundraising Booklets</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation, together with charity groups from Pingjin and other places, respectfully invited Panchen Lama to Ping to establish the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly last October. The expenses were raised by philanthropists from Ping, Tianjin, and Shanghai. The Shanghai Association publicly elected layman Qu Wenliu to participate. After the successful conclusion of the Dharma Assembly, he returned to Shanghai with various souvenirs and badges to be distributed to the philanthropists. However, because the addresses of many donors are unknown, they cannot be delivered. Those who have not received souvenirs can go to the association's office in the Renji Charity Hall on Yunnan Road to collect them. The association is currently finalizing the matter, so it is urging the return of the fundraising booklets previously issued.</p>

<p>Since the import of foreign sound films into China, the Chinese people have been captivated by the sights and sounds, and the outflow of money has been astonishing.

<h3 id="e142">Sports and Public Health Issues (Continued) <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Mr. Xu Xianfu of this city</p>
<p>Above, we have already raised many issues for discussion, which is enough to prove the danger and unsuitability of modern sports in China. Finally, let us solve the question of whether sports (as a whole) can be the way out for China? Of course, the discussion of this question must involve what is China's true way out? Let's first look at where the crux of China's illness lies? Is it ignorance, poverty, or weakness?</p>
<p>Initially, discussing weakness, we must ask why the Chinese people know that they are weak, and where is that seen? Is it the emigration rate? Or disease statistics? Needless to say, China lacks precise statistics. Even with current statistics, if the mortality rate is indeed very high, does this mortality rate exclude the causes of war, natural disasters, killings, and plagues? Do the disease statistics consist of substantial data, or do they exclude plagues? Before I have sufficient evidence regarding the issue of the weakness of the Chinese people to persuade me to advocate it, I cannot blindly follow the general promotion of sports to save weakness. (See previous remarks for further discussion). Some people say that Japan's strength lies in the prevalence of sports, but they do not know that such a statement is as absurd as Montesquieu's inference that the British political system is based on the separation of powers. We know that Japan's strength, although not absolute, is mostly due to the fact that peddlers, young people, and children are constantly reading. I remember Mr. Wang Yunwu once told us that in a Japanese inn, he saw the child who opened the door still reading a book while opening the door, and what he was reading was not a novel but a series of knowledge books and history and geography. These may be digressions, please forgive me. Next, discussing poverty, why is China poor? Positively, we cannot control nature, that is, we cannot utilize nature, and we lack productivity, so the country has little wealth. Negatively, we cannot control society, such as political failures and social disorders, which destroy productivity, and the country's wealth decreases. Therefore, to alleviate poverty, we must first be able to control nature and control society, and the implementation of these two methods is entirely related to the level of national knowledge. In the final analysis, China's way out lies in saving ignorance.</p>
<p>Finally, how do we save ignorance? Fascism is based on the idea of the organic state, believing that the people are like the cells of various organs, which is a physiological standpoint. I, however, have the idea of the organic nation, and stand from a biological point of view (in fact, Sun Yat-sen's nationalism is based on this, but people do not realize it). Because the existence of the people now is a continuation of the growth of their ancestors; reproduction is the continuation of life, and life is the development of life. Therefore, the people's responsibility is on the one hand to maintain the inherited qualities, and on the other hand to promote the function of evolution. This theory, explained in terms of universal physics, sees the former as centripetal force and the latter as centrifugal force. Only by having both of these forces simultaneously can the universe operate and have organization. Similarly, we need these two forces to cure the source of our nation's disease! Ignorance. As for how our nation maintains its inherited qualities? The inherent morality and inherent knowledge have long been lost, as others have already said, so there is no need to elaborate. How does our nation promote the function of evolution? In modern times, learning from Western civilization, such as training the army, has resulted in retreating in the face of foreign insults and going to civil war as if going to death, separating the country's territory, and declining national power. If we run schools, the result is to create batches of new-style bureaucrats and new-style young masters. If we learn sports,... with this situation, how can we avoid national destruction? But this is not my opposition to Western civilization, but rather my opposition to China only learning the superficial aspects of Western civilization, without knowing how to take the essence of Western civilization. Learning superficially results in [attempting to walk like Handan, crawling back]. Moreover, our country is already lagging behind the times, so how should we use the most economical method and follow the fastest path to obtain the true essence of modern civilization and catch up with the vanguard of the times?</p>
<p>Where lies the true essence of modern Western civilization?</p>
<p>One is the power of supply, and the other is the power of control. The so-called power of supply is to invent people's knowledge and technology, control nature, and produce raw materials for human evolution, which is the science of things. The so-called power of control is to guide the direction of people's knowledge and technology application, control society, and manage the finished products for human evolution, which is the science of people. Therefore, to obtain the true essence of Western civilization, we must put in practical effort to study hard and think deeply, without resorting to empty boasting and fanaticism. Indeed, China's shortcut to a way out lies in this.</p>
<p>If someone says that the true essence of Western civilization lies in sports, then I will have nothing to say. Montesquieu's misperception of British politics laid the foundation for modern democracy; the explanation of the Chu book by the Yan man, and the [烛] of the Yan man, could awaken King Zhao of Yan to seek talent. Perhaps sports may not be the path to China's prosperity, so why not let the people of the country rise up, use all their energy, and gather the power of the whole people to promote sports and implement sports. But I wonder what your opinion is?</p>

<h3 id="e143">[Ah Q's Likeness] <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>It seems that anyone who has read "The True Story of Ah Q" will never forget Ah Q's thoughts and consciousness? The essence of "The True Story of Ah Q" lies in the powerful revelation of this kind of "Ah Q's Likeness."</p>
<p>The main points of "Ah Q's Likeness" can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>When actually failing or submitting, one has "spiritual victory" to comfort oneself, thus "turning defeat into victory," and sleeping soundly. Ah Q's famous sayings, such as "being beaten by his son" and "my ancestors are stronger than yours," are his philosophy of "spiritual victory."</p>
<p>When Zhao Mu'ye or Zhao Xiucai's big stick comes, he usually dares not resist; when the fake foreign devil's little [杕] comes, he also does not resist; but when those whom Ah Q considers his equals or juniors, such as Wang Hu and Little D, approach Ah Q like friends, Ah Q wants to assert his status and even wants to establish his authority, although the result is often only "spiritual victory," but Ah Q's "ambition" will never fade.</p>
<p>This is the so-called "Ah Q's Likeness," which is also the common likeness of most Chinese people who have been educated by the direct descendants of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Confucius, and Mencius for thousands of years!</p>
<p>Since the publication of "The True Story of Ah Q," "Ah Q's Likeness" has been ridiculed by many people; but despite the ridicule, "Ah Q's Likeness" still manifests itself in the myriad social phenomena. Especially after the "September 18th" national crisis, the "spiritual victory" and "non-resistance" of "Ah Q's Likeness" can be said to have been brought into full play.</p>
<p>Then can "Ah Q's Likeness" also be said to be the national character of the Chinese nation? This is not necessarily the case! Because not all Chinese people with yellow faces are so incompetent. Haven't you seen the bloody battles of the Northeast Volunteer Army in the past year? The reason for this is probably that those Northeast people who joined the Volunteer Army have not received the inner teachings of the direct descendants of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Zhou, and Confucius.</p>
<p>On this point, the alias of "Ah Q's Likeness" can also be called "Saint's Likeness" or "Adult's Likeness."</p>

<p>Zhu Dan I have a secret to tell you. I've fallen in love with a very noble woman, and I'd like you to help me out by writing a little note for me to throw in front of her.</p>
<p>Professor Very good!</p>
<p>Zhu Dan It must be written very beautifully, right?</p>
<p>Professor Of course. Do you want to write to her in poetry? Zhu Dan No, no; no poetry.</p>
<p>Professor Do you want to write only in prose?</p>
<p>Zhu Dan No prose, and no poetry.</p>
<p>Professor Then if you don't use prose, you have to use poetry.</p>
<p>Zhu Dan Why is that?</p>
<p>Professor Because when a person wants to express himself, he is limited to using prose or poetry.</p>
<p>Zhu Dan Is there nothing else besides prose and poetry?</p>
<p>Professor No. Everything that is not prose is poetry, and everything that is not poetry is prose.</p>
<p>Zhu Dan Then? What are we using when we speak?</p>
<p>Professor Prose.</p>
<p>Zhu Dan What? When I say, "Nicole, bring my slippers, bring me my nightcap," is that also prose?</p>
<p>Professor Exactly.</p>
<p>Zhu Dan Good heavens, I've been speaking prose for more than forty years, and I didn't even know it myself.</p>

<p>— Ms. Cao Ruhui</p>
<p>Last night, he had a dream. Even now, the blurred and hazy dreamscape, like thin gauze, like light mist, is still faintly floating before his eyes. The dream was like this:</p>
<p>He didn't know when, but suddenly a pair of golden wings grew under his ribs, very large, like [垂天之] clouds. Flapping his wings, he rose from the ground very naturally, overlooking the earth in the vastness, in the clouds. It was rotating very quickly beneath him, making him dizzy and frightened, and finally he stopped on a high mountain of ten thousand [仭]. The mountain was in the clouds, on the horizon, in an unimaginable dreamscape. He stood proudly on the summit.</p>
<p>Look, how sublime he is! A light mist like thin gauze shrouded him, a colorful cloud floated above his head, the sun and moon smiled at him, and the stars twinkled at him. He occasionally looked down, and the ocean sang a clear song, worshipping at his feet; the smaller ones were like ants, like dust, tiny and insignificant. He occasionally laughed, and they all echoed his laughter. He occasionally became angry, and they were all terrified and trembled. Indeed, he stood above all, who knew how many thousands of millions of grains of dust had to accumulate to create this high mountain that reigned over all? So he sang and danced, as if victory and glory would forever belong to him. He despised everything, looked down on everything, trampled on everything. He thought that everything was insignificant and mediocre, only he was sublime and great. He arrogantly cast contemptuous glances around.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly, but also very slowly. He continued to laugh, dance, and sing!</p>
<p>One day, suddenly a tragic and loud song came from under his feet, from the underground layers, it was the chorus of thousands of people, and the lyrics were:</p>
<p>[We are dust, we are dust,]</p>
<p>We created the universe and the world, even this high mountain!! This towering throne was also accumulated from our flesh and blood. Look, that kid, that devil, how happily he sits on the summit!</p>
<p>We will forever endure the days under his throne. Brothers, we can no longer endure these days. Let's work together to throw that kid down, we want to be a free and equal grain of dust!</p>
<p>We want to create a free and equal world!] In this tragic song, a violent shock occurred under his feet, as if the sky was about to collapse, the earth was about to split, and a volcano was about to erupt. Along with this violent shock, he was tossed, dizzy, and confused. Immediately, he was furious, he shouted: [Stop, don't make noise, you beasts!]</p>
<p>But this scolding made the singing louder and the shock more violent, and finally the mountain collapsed, and like a dead dog, he rolled down from the summit. In his last breath, he still heard the loud song very clearly: [We want to be a free and equal grain of dust,] We want to create a free and equal world!] Last night, he had such a dream.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Yang Qiu Replies to [Yang Chun] <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Qiu</p>
<p>Last month, in order to criticize the so-called [words] published in a certain insignificant publication, I casually wrote an article [Reading the Special Issue of the Liberation Movement of Words [After Respectful Feeling]] and submitted it to Free Talk for publication. Recently, a friend told me that someone named [Yang Chun] had published an article in that boring publication to defend someone named Zeng, the gist of which was that I did not point out the shortcomings of Zeng's so-called [words], and that Zeng's words [had received many praises from the sports world, and would become an immortal work], and vaguely referred to me as a [ruffian] and a [纨绔子].] I think [Yang Chun] is really too stupid, simply pitifully stupid. (Someone named Zeng seems to be smarter.) Now, I would like to respectfully copy Zeng's [words] (?) again, and re-copy my criticism of Zeng's words as follows, so that [Yang Chun] can see it clearly again.</p>
<p>Painted Hall Spring</p>
<p>The days begin to lengthen at the start of the year, guests come to comfort my desolation. Casual entertainment is harmless, playing mahjong. Drink up all the wine in the cup, what do I care about national affairs. There are still beautiful women before the wine vessel, but I can't go wild and count the chips.</p>
<p>Magpie Branch North is severely cold, not as warm as Jiangnan; the puppet state actually sees peace, how is it like the chaos in the Central Plains?</p>
<p>[The Plenary Session] was also held, but saving the country became a suspended case; all the officials who attended got official positions, and no one cared about the national crisis.</p>
<p>The above is a copy of Zeng's words, and my criticism is: When the days are long, one should [entertain] and [play mahjong]; when there are [beautiful women] before the wine vessel, why should one care about [not going wild] [being unable to go wild]? [The times] are [new], I am old-fashioned, what do I care [what do I care]! Those who praise me do not necessarily have to be stern, a sneer is enough for someone with a sense of shame, Yang Chun, why must you force me to expose all the words, making it difficult for Zeng?</p>
<p>To be honest, in terms of consciousness, these two pages of [words] vividly portray Zeng as a representative of [小白脸 culture]!! No, just a fake [薄儿], a lecherous degenerate youth. You see, during the Lunar New Year, Shanhaiguan was captured by the Japanese army, and the Northeast Volunteer Army was fighting bitterly with the imperialists in the freezing cold, but our self-proclaimed [writer] Zeng felt that the days were too [long] and life was too [凑凉] (!), so he could only find a way to [entertain]. Fortunately, [guests came], and with four feet gathered, they [played mahjong]. After the boredom of playing mahjong was gone, they also had to [drink wine]. When the wine was drunk and the mood was high, they shouted: [What do I care about national affairs]. After shouting, they saw that there was [beautiful women] in the same seat (meaning women). They could not help but be happy and their hearts throbbed, wishing they could [go wild] immediately, but perhaps because there were people around hindering them, they finally [could not go wild], so Zeng could not help but sigh with regret. You see, in these short forty-seven characters, is there not a [小白脸] who does not know anything!! No, is there not a lecherous prodigal's ugly state vividly present? Is there not the face of a most vulgar frivolous young man active in it? Secondly, in the first half of the [卜算子], the sentence [the puppet state actually sees peace, how is it like] the chaos in the Central Plains, in addition to expressing boring complaints, it also wipes out the Japanese imperialists' atrocities in the Northeast, as well as the heroic struggle of the Northeast Volunteer Army against imperialism. Is it formally acknowledging that the Japanese imperialists' seizure of our Northeast is absolutely correct, what is the intention? Yang Chun, is the puppet state really [peaceful]? I advise you to quickly follow Zeng to the puppet state to be a docile citizen under the [Pu Yi Sacred Heavenly Son's rule]! And this is also the most appropriate way out for you and Zeng!</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of technique, Zeng's [words] are even more [incomprehensible]. As for [words], I certainly oppose deliberately carving and 反對[巧], but what about the so-called [打打麻將], what do I care about national affairs, is that really a sentence? Are [words] [liberated] in this way? [牛溲馬] [勃] are all called [words], and they are actually printed and said to be [liberated words]. If we do not want this [有毒質的東西] to harm innocent young people, if we do not want [纨绔子] to make trouble in the literary world, is it not appropriate to give him a little lesson?</p>
<p>Finally, I must sincerely advise Yang Chun to calm his mind, and also advise Zeng to recognize the times, recognize himself, and from now on, read more books, do more meaningful things, brag less, and write less disgusting poetry. I have said everything here, and if you continue to be verbose, I will not reply again, so as not to waste the valuable space of Free Talk and my own valuable time.</p>

<p>— By Sherwood Anderson, Translated by Yixian</p>
<p>At this time, she felt quite disillusioned with the old men; therefore, she left them, which made her very happy. She continued onward until she reached the shaded riverbank by the roadside; there, she saw fifty black people of her kind, who were evidently hired as porters. They were sitting down eating, separated by a considerable distance from a group of white gentlemen and ladies. The ladies were wearing shorts and cork helmets, and the black girl knew they were explorers, just like the men. They had just finished their meal. Some of them were dozing, and others were writing in their notebooks.</p>
<p>"What kind of expedition is this?" the black girl asked the leader of the porters.</p>
<p>"It's called the Curiosity Expedition," he replied.</p>
<p>"Are they good white people, or bad white people?" she asked.</p>
<p>"They are strange people, they don't mind making a fuss over small things," he said. "They ask questions just for the sake of asking questions."</p>
<p>"Hey! What are you doing?" one of the ladies called out. "Go away; you're not allowed to stop here. You'll distract the men."</p>
<p>"You're the same," the black girl said.</p>
<p>"Tch, girl," the lady said. "I'm fifty years old. I'm asexual. They're very familiar with me. You should go away."</p>
<p>"You don't need to worry: they aren't white people," the black girl said in a rather contemptuous tone. "Why do you call yourselves the Curiosity Expedition? What are you curious about? Are you curious about God?"</p>
<p>This remark elicited such a joyful burst of laughter that it woke up those who were dozing, and they asked others to retell the joke to them.</p>
<p>"Civilized people only started to have any curiosity about this question a few centuries ago," one of the gentlemen said. "It was before the fifteenth century, I think," another said. "Shakespeare was a complete atheist."</p>
<p>"Shakespeare can't be considered everyone," a third person said. "The national anthem is a product of the eighteenth century. Look, in it, we use God to do our dirty political work."</p>
<p>"That God is different," the second gentleman said. "In the Middle Ages, God was considered to be making us, teaching us to work incessantly. Once the bourgeoisie rose up, the feudal aristocracy overturned the obligations that had always been the price of their privileges, and people got a new God. This new God is used by the upper classes, teaching him to work incessantly. Destroy their politics; obstruct their conspiracies—do this, do that."</p>
<p>"Yes," the first gentleman said; "and then, there's the third one, the petty bourgeoisie's God, whose job it is to wipe the book clean on Sundays with his blood, when they fill it up during the week with their business frauds in the book of angels who record human good and evil."</p>
<p>"Both of these Gods are still in power," the third gentleman said. "If you have these doubts, then try replacing a suitable verse in the second verse of the national anthem; or try removing the confession of sins from the prayer book."</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<p>Ideal Rural Education (Part 2) Xu Zhengji 3. Supporting the Establishment of Agricultural Product Cooperatives. In recent years, the people who have been directly or indirectly exploited by capitalists are the villagers. Merchants have used every possible means of exploitation, so the phenomenon of "rural economic bankruptcy" has become unstoppable. We say "education is omnipotent," they say "education is the root of all evil." There are many sources of funding for the education sector that rely on the blood and sweat of farmers, and we should give them a strong arm out of compassion. "Agricultural product" cooperatives are a good way to free them from the monopoly of merchants and the exploitation of farmers. However, they do not understand the meaning and organization of cooperatives. Teachers in rural schools should promote and publicize the benefits of cooperatives. The Jiangsu Construction Department is very enthusiastic about the cooperative cause and has established cooperative instructors in various counties to specifically guide farmers' cooperative enterprises. This is indeed a good phenomenon. In the current economically bankrupt rural areas, obtaining this powerful assistance may be a boost to rural economic recovery.</p>
<p>4.  Assisting in Organizing Rural Farmers' Defense Corps. In recent years, people's livelihoods have declined to the extreme, resulting in rampant bandits and people living in dire straits. Although local governments should bear the responsibility, farmers may as well arm themselves for self-defense. With peaceful neighborhoods, all undertakings can be carried out. If rural schools want to be the center of the community, this is also an important task.</p>
<p>In schools, organize Boy Scouts to give them a disciplined, militarized upbringing. Rural children have many opportunities to exercise their bodies. It is better to replace the gymnastics subject with Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>(4) How to Transform Rural Education</p>
<p>Past rural education has undoubtedly failed. This is due to pursuing quantity over quality. In the future, we should change our approach, "seeking quality over quantity," striving for economic concentration, employing good teachers, and being responsible for management. Existing rural primary school teachers should be selected by administrative authorities from specialized talents to preside over short-term training in order to achieve the realization of saving rural education and working together. The current priorities are: (To be continued)</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>Schools Should Pay Attention to the Ministry of Education's Regulations on Covering Reports with Seals</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has formulated regulations for covering reports with seals on seal paper. In addition to ordering all educational institutions and universities directly under its jurisdiction, it has also issued a circular to the education departments of all provinces and cities, stating that the seals of institutions are used for identification and to show trustworthiness. The custody and use of seals are extremely important. In recent years, students applying to schools have often forged diplomas in the hope of deceiving the authorities. After being admitted, they are submitted to the Ministry for review and have been repeatedly discovered. This kind of bad behavior not only hinders the education system but also violates criminal law. The Ministry has always taken strict measures to crack down on this. Therefore, two types of seal paper for institutions and schools have been specially made. In addition to distributing them for completion, this circular, together with ○ copies of the seal paper form, is attached. The Department is ordered to immediately cover the seal paper for institutions with seals and distribute the seal paper for schools to the affiliated public and private secondary schools, instructing them to comply with the procedures together and submit them to the Ministry for filing. This order (1) This seal collection contains five copies: one copy is kept in the Secretariat of the Ministry, one copy is kept in the Higher Education Department, one copy is kept in the General Education Department, one copy is kept in the General Affairs Department, and one copy is filed.</p>
<p>(2) Education Departments and Bureaus of all provinces, Education Bureaus or Social Bureaus of municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, and the Weihaiwei Management Office, etc., should cover five copies of the seal of the Department, Bureau, or Office on the institution seal paper and submit them.</p>
<p>(3) Each university should cover five copies of the university seal and the seals of each college and department of the university on the school seal paper and the school college and department seal paper. For example, Central University should cover five copies of the university seal, using five school seal papers, and also cover five copies of the seals of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Education, and Agriculture, using ten school college and department seal papers. Example 2: Peking University should cover five copies of the university seal, using five school seal papers, and also cover five copies of the seals of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, and Law, using five school college and department seal papers.</p>
<p>(4) Each independent college should cover five copies of the college seal on the school seal paper and submit them.</p>
<p>(5) Each specialized school should cover five copies of the school seal on the school seal paper and submit them.</p>
<p>(6) Each secondary school should cover five copies of the school seal on the school seal paper and submit them.</p>
<p>(7) Seal paper for national, provincial, and registered private specialized schools and above will be sent directly to the schools by the Ministry, and each school will report directly to the Ministry.</p>
<p>(8) Seal paper for public and private secondary schools in each province and city will be sent to the schools by the Ministry of Education Departments and Bureaus, and each school will submit them to the competent Department or Bureau for reporting to the Ministry.</p>
<p>(9) If the seal paper is insufficient, national, provincial, and registered private specialized schools and above may apply to the Ministry for requisition. If it is forwarded by the Education Department or Bureau, the Department or Bureau may copy and forward it according to the issued format and paper quality.</p>

<p>Returning School Buildings in Beijing to the National Government</p>
<p>The central government has accumulated arrears of over 1.11 million yuan in various expenses owed to Jinan University over the years. The school had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to urge payment. The Ministry of Education, according to the request, consulted the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance replied that, given the severity of the national crisis and the extraordinary shortage of funds, it was truly unable to allocate funds to pay the arrears owed to Jinan University. In addition, the school plans to move the middle school division to the original school buildings in Nanjing, and has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to return a school building located in Xuejia Lane, Nanjing. The Ministry of Education, according to the situation, reported to the Executive Yuan. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan ordered that the return of the school buildings in Beijing to Jinan University has been reported to the National Government, and ordered that it be notified immediately.</p>

<p>The Suzhou Tiansizhuang Private Jinghai Women's Normal School has been established for thirty years and has made many contributions to elementary and early childhood education in China. Its reputation has spread throughout the country. Currently, the school's alumni association, due to the fact that alumni from previous years are scattered in all directions and news is scarce, is inevitably estranged in terms of emotion. To this end, it is planned to publish an alumni directory in this academic journal for communication purposes. It is reported that the person collecting this report is Ms. Zhou Suzhen, who is currently publishing a notice in the newspaper to all alumni, limiting the deadline to mid-May, asking them to send their current and permanent mailing addresses to Ms. Zhou.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Colleagues of the Vocational Education Society Formulate Measures for Concurrently Undertaking National Salvation Work <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>To be Implemented Immediately</p>
<p>The China Vocational Education Society, in view of the loss of the Northeast, and now with the outbreak of the Rehe War, believes that the rise and fall of the nation depend on it. This is a critical moment for the survival of the Chinese people. Therefore, it has joined forces with the office and all colleagues of the self-managed, agency-managed, and jointly managed institutions to formulate measures for concurrently undertaking national salvation work. The measures have been approved by the office staff meeting and will be implemented immediately. The progress of the work must be reported monthly for comparison. The measures are as follows: 1. All food and supplies must use domestic products and be widely encouraged in general society. The method of encouragement should be carried out according to local conditions. 2. Do not use Japanese goods. We have already taken an oath two years ago and should strictly abide by the oath. How to publicize this should also be considered according to local conditions. 3. Donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army. The amount does not matter, as long as it can be continued. Schools should use this to encourage students, and villages should use this to encourage farmers. The method of payment can be sent through the special department of the Society or sent to the bank. The names and amounts of all donors will be published in the Society's monthly report every month. 4. In all kinds of school-style education, for children, youth, or adults, in ordinary classes, when there is teaching material related to national culture or Sino-foreign relations, we should do our best to arouse national spirit. Outside of class, we should find ways to make students develop patriotic thoughts, expand national consciousness, and deepen national sentiment. Here are a few examples: (1) Hold weekly meetings to report on current events and lecture on national humiliations and national hatred; (2) Compose patriotic songs and have students practice singing them; (3) Compile and post wall newspapers, focusing on national hatred and national humiliation; (4) Compile and post pictures, focusing on national hatred and national humiliation; (5) Give a 5-minute speech before class, all about patriotism and national salvation. The words should be concise, refined, and stimulating, or do it during the first class of each day; (6) Introduce national heroes, compile stories and novels, or ballads, and have students read and sing them; (7) Guide defense organizations and carry out military training; (8) Pay special attention to cultivating young people who have special achievements and can be developed, so that they can become patriots. 5. In all kinds of social-style education, for the people being taught (especially farmers in rural areas), in addition to education on livelihood, science, etc., we should find ways to arouse patriotic feelings, explain the world situation, and train them in group life and cooperative habits. It may be worthwhile to make teaching about shame and war the main goal. The teaching materials and methods are roughly the same as the previous examples. 6. All colleagues of the institutions should use their usual enthusiasm for education, identify national salvation work as the only goal at present, and formulate a new kind of discipline for themselves in terms of self-cultivation, using money and objects, within and outside the scope of their duties, social interactions, and spare time (such as redoubling their efforts, being particularly frugal, reducing entertainment, and participating in patriotic movements, all of which can be specified one by one) to adapt to the current needs. It is advisable for everyone to write out these rules themselves for colleagues to consider and imitate. It is especially hoped that they will be able to write out their practical experience one by one in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e154">A Letter from Colleagues in the Shanghai Education Community to Colleagues in the National Education Community <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Education Community Should Lead by Example in Advocating for National Salvation and Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>Recognize that All Educational Endeavors Take Patriotic National Salvation as Their Soul</p>
<p>Divide into Passive and Active Aspects, and Make Strenuous Efforts to Implement</p>
<p>Esteemed Colleagues in the National Education Community, the brutal Japanese militarists, indulging in their militaristic fervor, disregard all humanitarianism, justice, and treaties, occupy our land, slaughter our people. The puppet state of the Northeast has already been established, the scars of Shanghai have not yet healed, and now the war in Rehe has begun. To satisfy their insatiable greed, disturbing Tianjin and Peiping, and coveting the Yangtze River and the sea, are all within expectations. Our people, facing this desperate situation, have no choice but to rise up united, with the determination to die, seeking a new path to regeneration. What else is there to say?</p>
<p>In recent years, the government has been plagued by internal suppression of bandits and misled by external mediation, hesitating and indecisive, leading to the failure to recover lost territory. Our fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and relatives in the three northeastern provinces have been groaning and suffering in captivity for years. This is truly an unprecedented humiliation. Righteous people weep blood and wish to sacrifice themselves; brave warriors sing mournful songs and think of killing the enemy. The hearts of the people of the nation are not all dead. In the Battle of Shanghai, loyalty and bravery were recognized worldwide, while the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army rose time and again, sparing no effort to fight the brutal enemy with their flesh and blood, enduring hardships for more than a year. Their righteousness and benevolence have moved people far and wide. Now the government has resolved to resist the enemy, and a large army of over 200,000 is saving Rehe. The morale is high, and the pent-up feelings are waiting to be unleashed. Even poor farmers in remote areas provide supplies and transportation, even if it means bankruptcy, without complaint. Even elementary school students donate money and goods, ashamed to be behind others in patriotism. Judging from the manifestation of public sentiment, it is not difficult to predict the future of the nation.</p>
<p>What is concerning is that inland transportation is traditionally inconvenient, and the general public lacks organization. Therefore, the arousal of national sentiment, the expansion of national consciousness, and the strengthening and effectiveness of collective action all depend on the enlightenment and training of broad education. This is the responsibility of our colleagues in the national education community. To abandon the pen for the sword and rush to the front lines is indeed an urgent need of the moment, but this cannot be expected of everyone, nor is it necessary to expect it of everyone. In today's large-scale war and long-term resistance, the front lines rely on a large number of brave soldiers who sacrifice their lives on the battlefield, while the rear relies on a large number of organized people who are active in their communities, cooperating and working together to maximize effectiveness. In this extraordinary change, it is impossible to achieve anything by following old habits and living as usual. It is imperative that all the people of the country, whether farmers, workers, merchants, or scholars, regardless of who they are, should devote a portion of their daily work, resources, and energy to engaging in national salvation work in addition to their existing occupations, in order to reverse this critical situation. Our colleagues in the national education community should lead by example, personally advocating for it, recognizing that all current work must be centered on national salvation and resistance against Japan, that all undertakings must take national salvation and resistance against Japan as the pivotal point, and that all education must take patriotic national salvation as its soul.</p>
<p>Now, let us try to list concrete examples, hoping that our colleagues in the national education community will work together diligently and strive to implement them.</p>
<p>(1) In the passive aspect, we must eradicate the despicable mentality of complacency, change the bad habits of extravagance and laziness, eliminate the cruel and cold atmosphere of exclusion and suspicion, and redouble our efforts, frugality, diligence, and tolerance. Material enjoyment can be postponed to another day, and there is no need to dwell on trivial grievances.</p>
<p>(2) In the active aspect, we must encourage the courage to avenge our shame, inspire the spirit of chivalry and sacrifice, and motivate the national consciousness of the majority of people. We must strengthen their group organization and cultivate their arduous life. In classroom lectures, in addition to subjects such as civics and history, we must also devote a portion of the time to instilling patriotic thoughts. In extracurricular activities, in addition to gatherings and drills, we must also pay attention to their individual personalities, in order to cultivate aspiring people with ambition. As for the general public, we must also make contact and establish connections with them, participate in the organization of their patriotic groups, and assist in the progress of their national salvation work. As for those who specialize in mass education, they should take the awakening of the national soul as their only mission.</p>
<p>Now that the country has reached this point, who is to blame need not be investigated in detail. Our education community only feels immense shame and remorse and seeks to atone for our sins and strive to redeem ourselves. If we are unwilling to make efforts for even this minimum amount of national salvation work and continue to live in a drunken stupor, regarding the rise and fall of the nation as having nothing to do with us, how can we face our numerous students, our common people, and especially our soldiers who have died on the battlefield? Ask yourself, and reflect upon it. According to the Tianjin newspaper, a female storyteller named Li Xiangrong gives a five-minute patriotic speech before each performance to inspire the audience. In Germany, middle school students practice martial arts in the cold and snow, claiming that Germany is a nation disarmed by others and wishing to forge their bodies into plowshares and iron to clash with the enemy's guns and cannons. Our colleagues in the national education community, remember this, and deeply remember that the mentors who guide the people should not be inferior to a small female storyteller. Can we not feel ashamed in our hearts for the words and deeds of German middle school students? Saving the country is saving oneself, and everyone has a heart. Do not yield when it comes to benevolence, please start with yourself. We respectfully express our heartfelt thoughts, hoping that you will take note of them.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Shanghai Middle School Affiliated Elementary School to Hold 30th Anniversary Celebration <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 8th of this month</p>
<p>The Provincial Shanghai Middle School Experimental Elementary School, located on Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen, was founded in the 29th year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, originally named the 22nd Shop Elementary School. Later, due to its perfect management, it was ordered by the province to be renamed the Affiliated Elementary School of Longmen Normal School. Afterwards, the Normal School repeatedly changed its name, and the school also changed its name accordingly, from the 2nd Affiliated Elementary School to the Shanghai Middle School Experimental Elementary School. It usually pays attention to the experiments of new education, so it has always been well-known in the elementary education community. It is recently learned that the school has reached its 30th anniversary since its establishment, and it has been decided to hold a commemorative ceremony on the morning of March 8th. Zhou, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, Jia Jiying, the founder of the school, and Yang Pingyu, the former principal, will be invited to deliver speeches, and Shen Yougan, Ni Shangda, Gan Yuyuan, Chen Bai, and other graduates of the school will give speeches to plan for future improvements. On the morning of the 9th, an alumni association will be held to gather alumni from past years and hold a commemorative meeting. On the afternoons of the 8th and 9th, there will be art exhibitions and costume propaganda to resist Japan and contribute to national salvation. Moreover, many famous elementary schools in Shanghai are old friends of Longmen, so the performers participating in the art exhibition include more than ten schools such as Wanzhu, Xicheng, Wuben, Jingye, Yangzhi, Shangwen, Feihong, Danhua, Shihua, and Rongzheng, gathering the essence of elementary schools in the city. It is sure to be wonderful. It is also reported that on the 8th and 9th, there will be several commemorative rooms for graduates of past years, displaying photos of graduates from the past 30 years, and various historical scenes such as the return of Qingdao and Jinan after the World War and the rushing out of Yuguan, to jointly awaken the spirit of common hatred. At the same time, a thick commemorative book for the 30th anniversary of the school's establishment will be printed and presented to the guests, detailing the changes in China's educational goals over the past 30 years, as well as the evolution of elementary school courses, which will be helpful for studying the history of modern Chinese education.</p>

The society has high expectations, and although the scale has been roughly formed in the past 20 years, the colleagues dare not be complacent about this and should continue to work hard to promote social evolution. Now that the original school building is not enough for application, it is planned to build a new school building and art museum on the Xujiahui base to build a cultural foundation. Then, President Liu Haisu reported on the current status of school affairs and future development plans, and read aloud Chairman Cai Yuanpei's own inscription on the initiation of the construction of the school's new school building and art museum, which was unanimously approved, and the committee charter was revised.

<h3 id="e161">Tonight at 8:00 PM, Women's Basketball Game: Liangjiang vs. Western League <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Location... Chinese Basketball Room</p>
<p>Spirits Rise After Three Losses</p>
<p>See if We Can Win Tonight</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team has been competing with Western teams for days and unfortunately lost. The Chinese people are disappointed because the team is about to travel to Europe and the United States. However, according to reliable information, the team members are not all going abroad. The Liangjiang School authorities are very cautious about the selection of team members who will go abroad and are still in the process of selecting. According to people in the sports world, there are three main reasons for Liangjiang's failure in recent days: (1) The Liangjiang team won the Western Youth Basketball Championship, and this time the Western Youth teams are determined to seek revenge and fight bravely. The Liangjiang team has no prejudice, so it cannot compete with the enemy. (2) The Liangjiang team is a newly formed team with only half a year of training. It is not as experienced as the old team, and it has always won battles and rarely failed. Its combat experience is still lacking, so it cannot cope with setbacks. (3) The Liangjiang team has had too much time for practice and competition recently, resulting in excessive fatigue of the team members. It is not that Liangjiang's technique is inferior to when it won the Western Youth Championship. However, the Liangjiang team members are focused on practice, and winning or losing is what they consider, so they are not discouraged by this. Tonight, they are scheduled to compete with the Western All-Star Women's Basketball League again. The time is still 8:00 PM, and the location has been changed to the Chinese Basketball Room in the French Concession. Tickets are 60 cents each. This competition is the last of Liangjiang's recent friendly competitions with Western teams, and the opponent is the elite of the Federation. The female athletes of Liangjiang are determined to fight hard. Moreover, this year's International Basketball Tournament will start this week, and the Liangjiang team members have all been selected as members of the Chinese national team, and the Federation team will also participate in the competition, so this match is no less than a preliminary competition between the Chinese national team and the Federation team.</p>

<p>The Current Situation and the Exchange Market</p>
<p>Gold Price Falls by Three Taels and Eight Mace</p>
<p>Large Bars Shrink, High Quotes Cause Panic, Eventually Lowered. Although the gold market opened well yesterday, public uncertainty and the deteriorating situation had an adverse impact on the market. As a result, prices fell. The exchange market also hardened. In the morning market, foreign telegrams indicated that London large bars had suddenly shrunk by 125 in both near and far terms. New York silver prices remained unchanged, but forward silver prices fell by more than 2%. Bank private cables then decreased by 0.1875, and the exchange market opened tighter than the previous close. The gold market then jumped to open at 774 taels and one mace. It was initially stable, and the exchange market was also good. Banque Belge pour l'Étranger and McCallum first closed June US dollars at 9.1875 and 9.25, so it once rose to 6 mace. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quotes for both sterling and US dollars remained unchanged, but a downward trend was observed. Citibank offered April US dollars at 9 yuan, and June at 9.3125 was not easy to sell, so it dropped to 70 taels. After entering the market, even 9.375 was difficult to get out, and it fell to 68 taels and three mace, closing at 769 taels and eight mace. In the early morning, the opening price was 770 taels and nine mace due to the residual momentum of the noon close. The exchange market also showed some improvement, and banks were trading April US dollars at 9 yuan, once rising to 2 taels and 4 mace. However, the situation quickly deteriorated, sellers were very active, and public suspicion was heavy, leading to a downward trend. As a result, the exchange market also hardened. June gold traded at 9 yuan and a half before buyers appeared. Da Xing Yong fiercely sold, and only when it reached 66 taels and six mace did it start to rebound. Telegrams from Bombay reported a drop of more than ten annas, then a rise to more than 9 taels. However, the market still could not recover. No one wanted June US dollars at 9 yuan and a half, so it was lowered to 766 taels and a half, closing at 767 taels. The trend did not look promising and there was still volatility. Although the Central Bank intervened with spot sales, it was at a time of decline, and the amount was small, making it difficult to effect change. Shanghai Clearing House added eleven and a half taels. Swaps for March and April were priced at 3 taels to 3.41. It was observed that the market was chaotic during the day due to public panic, with sellers dominating. The market conditions for the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened with a jump to 774 taels and two mace, a rise of 3 taels and four mace from the previous close, then to 4 taels. The exchange market also opened tighter than the previous close. Recent prices for sterling exchange were one shilling eight pence and one-eighth of a penny, and US exchange was 8.75. Hengxing was the first to buy bars, adding to 4 taels and seven mace. Yuanheng Hengyu came to sell, retreating to 3 taels and nine mace. Banque Belge pour l'Étranger bought June gold at 9.1875, Qingfa Yong bought bars, reaching 5 taels. Da Decheng Zhifeng Yong further bought, reaching 6 taels. Yu Hengyu came to sell, dropping to within 2 taels, to 4 taels and six mace. McCallum still closed June US dollars at 25, rising again to 5 taels and four mace. The Commodity Exchange then came to short sell, falling to around 4 taels. Jiuyin Feng offered June shillings at 25, but because Yuanmao Yong had once come to buy, there was still a struggle. By the time June US dollars were difficult to sell, Zhaofeng Chang came to sell, breaking to within 4 taels. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quotes for both sterling and US dollars did not change, but fell further. Da Xing Yong was selling, and Hengxing also sold, falling to 1.18 taels. Citibank also offered April US dollars at 9 yuan. Retail investors absorbed some, slightly improving by a few qian. Yuancheng Yong offered more, and the exchange market had hardened. June US dollars at 9.3125 could not be sold, falling to 1 tael, then retreating to 70 taels. The Commodity Exchange short selling came to buy back, rising by about 2 taels. Da Xing Yong Yifeng Yong offered again, creating a cloud of gloom and breaking 70 taels. Banque Belge pour l'Étranger offered March US dollars at 9.375, and Qian Changxiang also sold, falling to 68 taels and a half. Qingfa Yong took advantage of the low prices to buy, so it hovered and rose, gradually improving to 1 tael and four mace because Hengxing Yuanmao Yong also slightly bought at this time. June US dollars at 9.175 were also difficult to sell, remaining at 0.05. Datong bought July US dollars at 9 yuan and a half, Fuyu came to buy, so it rose again to more than 1 tael. March US dollars at 9.875 could not be closed, Zhifeng Yong also bought, reaching 2 taels. Bingxing sold bars on the market, leading to a downward trend. Zhaofeng Chang sold even more, to within 1 tael, Qian Changxiang also sold, to around 70 taels. At this time, there were fluctuations of a few qian, once rising back to 0.056. Da Xing Yong continued to fiercely sell, falling to 0.01 tael. Hengxing then bought spot gold on behalf of the Central Bank, so it added to 0.06 tael. However, the environment was poor, public sentiment was uncertain, and the exchange market remained hard. Banks were willing to offer February shillings at 25 and US dollars at 8.875, retail investors fiercely sold, breaking 70 taels. Zhaofeng Chang Yuanheng sold even more to 68 taels and three mace, but because Hengxing continued to buy, it gradually rose again to 70 taels, closing shortly after at 769 taels and eight mace. After the market closed, Qian Changxiang also bought, pulling up public sentiment, and Yuanheng, etc., also bought bars, rising to about 1 tael, so the Commodity Exchange sold at 70 taels and eight mace.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at 770 taels and nine mace, with the residual momentum after the noon close still strong, then adding to 1 tael and one mace. Yuancheng Yong came to sell, so it hovered within 1 tael. Seikin bought March shillings at 1.875, Yifeng Yong advanced to 1 tael, Hengyu Yuanheng also bought, reaching 1 tael and a half. Banque Belge sold April US dollars at 9 yuan to Zhijin, Fuyu bought even more to more than 2 taels, to 2 taels and four mace. Da Decheng also bought at this time. However, the market was still weak, Hengyu sold, retreating to within 2 taels. Zhaofeng Chang sold even more, to 1 tael, because Banque Belge was still offering April US dollars at 9 yuan. The Commodity Exchange continued to short sell, falling to 0.01 tael, but buyers were still strong, Fuyu Zhaofeng Chang Yuanxin Yong all absorbed, reaching about 1 tael. Hengxing Da Decheng advanced even more, rising again to 1 tael and seven mace. Qian Changxiang then came to sell bars, to about 1 tael. After this, although Hengxing's style was to communicate, due to extreme public fear, it could only temporarily hold the price, but Hengxing's buying amount was limited, and the number of sellers increased. McCallum offered June US dollars at 9.375, Yuanmao Yong Hengyu sold, breaking 70 taels. Banque Belge offered even more April US dollars at 9.0625, Zhaofeng Chang sold even more to around 9 taels. Because the exchange market was very loose and chaotic, Bingxing Qian Chang Qian Changxiang sold even more to 8 taels, and no one wanted June US dollars at 9.4375. The selling trend was even stronger, falling to within 7 taels, to 6 taels and six mace. Pan Gen Hua Bi mutually closed June US dollars at 9.4375 and half a yuan. After a struggle, there was a rise of ten. Fuyu advanced to around the entry price, Yongfeng also came to buy bars, to 8 taels and a half. Bombay telegraphed a drop of ten annas, then a rise to around 9 taels. Because large accounts were slightly consolidating, retail investors and the Commodity Exchange mutually raised and pressed, once rising from half tael to 39 taels and one mace. Although there were many buyers, because Da Hu Renxing Yong sold a lot at this time, gold prices were still difficult to support. First, retail investors sold, leading to an upward trend, and then Shunli Qing Yong came to sell, to 7 taels. Zhifeng Yong once came to buy, although there was a small improvement of a few qian, because Zhaofeng Chang Da Xing Yong continued to sell, June US dollars were half a yuan also difficult to sell, buyers needed 9.5615, so it fell even more to 6 taels and a half. After this, there was little change. Da Xing Yong suddenly came to buy, gradually rising to 7 taels and four mace. Finally, there was a downward trend, closing at 767 taels. There were still many buyers at the close, and Hengxing, etc., also bought, improving to around 7 taels and a half, while the Commodity Exchange still sold at 7 taels. It was observed that the highest price during the day was 776 taels, and the lowest price was 766 taels and a half, with a difference of 9 taels and a half. As a result, it fell by 3 taels and eight mace from the previous close.</p>
<p>Based on the exchange rate, because the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quote did not change, the US exchange rate of 8.275 translated to a gold price of 845 taels, eight mace and one fen, which implied a premium of about 78, more than 3 taels higher than the previous close. March ledger was 775 taels, April was 770 taels, morning water was 771 taels, and afternoon was 769 taels. On the surface, there seemed to be more sellers than buyers. Da Xing Yong Bingxing Zhaofeng Chang Yuancheng Yong Qian Changxiang Yuanmao Yong Fuchang Hengyu all sold, especially Da Xing Yong, which had over a thousand. Hengxing Zhifeng Yong Yongfeng Da Decheng Yifeng Yong Yuanxin Yong Qingfa Yong Fuyu, etc., all bought. There was not much trading by the Ningbo gang, and the Guangdong gang bought more.</p>
<p>Spot gold was extremely quiet, and there were no formal transactions in the market. Only Dafeng Heng sold one flat to Yingfeng Heng, priced at eleven and a half taels higher. However, the asking price for spot gold by pawnshops was generally at thirteen taels, and the buying price in the market was twelve taels, with very few transactions.</p>
<p>Swaps were also particularly unstable. Initially, the spot number Yingfeng Heng had over 3,000 taels in stock, so it came to swap a three-four month premium price of 1.2 taels. Huiyuan first posted eight bars to Yingfeng Heng, Da Decheng consecutively posted twice to Yingfeng Heng, totaling 70 bars. Yuanmao Yong also came to post 77 bars, all priced at 3 taels. Ruixing also came to post 70 bars to Tongfeng Heng, priced at 3 taels and four mace. Hengxing issued 133 bars to Yingfeng Heng, priced at 77 taels and one qian, as a January ledger transaction.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Foreign Exchange Initially Tight, Then Loose <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Banks and Gold Businesses Also Initially Bought, Then Sold</p>
<p>The exchange market and the gold standard suffered the same fate, starting well but ending badly. The morning opening was due to London's big cutbacks in both near and far futures of 125, sterling rose 75 against the dollar, and the dollar rose 1.5625 against sterling, but it was not significant. The opening price for near-term sterling was one shilling eight pence one-eighth of a penny, slightly better by 0.0625 than the previous close. New York silver prices did not move, but because the forward silver price on the gold exchange fell by more than 2%, the bank's private wire also fell by 0.1875. The opening price for near-term US dollars was 28.75, also tighter by 0.0625 than the previous close. Initially, it was still good, with Huabi first buying June US dollars at 1875, then 25, but purchased by McCallum, after which it became looser. It was difficult to sell June US dollars at this price, and HSBC's sterling and dollar quotes did not change, making it even harder. In the morning, US dollars for June at 375 were not easy to get out, and although it was once good in the afternoon, the banks traded US dollars for April at 29, and it was still loose afterwards, gradually hardening. Finally, there were no buyers for June US dollars at 29 and a half, and until the closing price, the asking price for near-term sterling was shillings, one shilling eight pence one-eighth of a penny, and the US exchange rate was 28.8125, only seeing far futures hardening, while near-term futures were still flat. There was buying and selling in the banking sector, but the final result was still absorbing stomach ache when the market was loose. Generally, there was more buying at the beginning and more selling later. The gold industry also entered and exited intermittently. As a result, the shilling was still flat and slightly tighter than the previous close for one day, while the dollar hardened by 0.0625. The bank's ups and downs for the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price for sterling exchange was one shilling eight pence one-eighth of a penny, and Huabi and Citibank both bought March 1875, while Hefeng sold June 25.

The silver swap for the early and noon markets was uniformly white borrowed, and no water was added, resulting in exchange drafts of 2,700,050 in the early market and 1,490,000 in the afternoon market.

<h3 id="e173">A Glimpse of the Competition in the Money Industry Market Before the Implementation of Abolishing Cents <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Had Too Much Foreign Currency But Not Enough Silver Hastened to Sell</p>
<p>Afternoon Agreed Prices Were Collected by the Reserve</p>
<p>Abolishing the foreign cent was inevitable, but the date had already been decided to be implemented on March 1st (today), so yesterday, money houses, silver firms, and banks with excess foreign currency and not enough silver or excess silver and not enough foreign currency had to fully balance their positions yesterday to avoid difficulties in temporary allocation. The situation in the early and noon markets yesterday is recorded separately below. (Early market) Money houses, industry colleagues, and banks generally had excess foreign currency to sell, because the current market was flooded, and the cent price had a real possibility of falling. Now, restricted by the standard price, unable to reduce it, they all sold, but without a buyer, they had to compete fiercely with each other. As a result, Fuyuan Jiang came forward to buy as much as possible, but the cent price still had to be set at 7 qian 1 fen 5 li. The foreign currency bought by Fuyuan Zhuang was no less than 2,000,000, and each of the Central, China, and Jiaotong banks distributed tens of thousands, so the early market passed stably. (Noon market) There were even more sellers, and Fuyuan continued to receive at first, but by half past one, it had exceeded 1,000,000, and the sellers were still crowded, so they stopped buying, and the market suddenly stalled, unable to close. The industry association had to convene a temporary executive supervisory committee to discuss the day's methods, agreeing that all colleagues who wanted to sell in the noon market would be bought by the money industry reserve at the market price minus 1 hao 2 hu 5, and if colleagues wanted to buy, they would also be priced at 7.14875. Once this order was issued, the colleagues rushed to buy, so the reserve sold 1,670,000, and the noon cent price was set at 7 qian 1 fen 4 li 8 hao 7 hu 5. It was already half past three when the market closed.</p>

<p>New York, February 27th, Telegraph. The improvement in the banking situation last weekend made those selling gold dollars increasingly dominant. Today, foreign exchange was consistently firm, and the franc has risen to a position where it is profitable to transport cash to France by ship.</p>
<p>The money market turned firm today. Although the short-term discount interest rate is still 1%, transactions outside the market cannot be completed at this price. Bank loan interest rates have risen by 1.5%, which is due to demand and unwillingness of banks to balance directly.</p>
<p>The Kercheval case empowers the financial administrator with supreme authority over national banks. His authority can urgently dispose of bank liquidity and limit withdrawal limits according to recent withdrawals and average deposit limits. This method can prevent banks from suspending withdrawals, like the Michigan crisis.</p>

<p>After Settlement, the Bond Market Suddenly Entered a Stagnant State</p>
<p>With the War in Full Swing... Bulls Inevitably Become Cautious</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the public bond market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to reports that someone had proposed allocating 20% of the bond fund to military expenses, although it was unfounded rumors, the market was somewhat shaken by it. Issue 21 and retail investors sold, and the opening market generally trended downwards, with Load Bonds falling by 7 jiao and 5 fen as the largest decline. In the second market, troop cuts were partially compensated by short covering, rebounding by 1 or 2 jiao, but remained sluggish afterwards. Issues 21 and 34 were sold, continuing to decline by 1 or 2 jiao, but salt tax rebounded by 5 fen. The market gradually became stagnant, with only over 2.3 million traded in the morning, and the afternoon trading was even quieter. The opening market for food reserves had no transactions, Issue 18 customs duty had no buying or selling all day, and the market price was extremely stagnant as a result. The various bonds for April failed to open, and the closing market was even more deserted, with prices only fluctuating by 5 fen. After settlement, the market price suddenly became stagnant, due to the mutual persistence of both bulls and bears and the wait-and-see attitude of large accounts. According to the League of Nations situation, the impression was still good, but the future of the war was difficult to be optimistic about. In Tianjin and Hankou, the Japanese were strictly prepared, as if on the verge of a breakout, and it was inevitable that the bulls would be cautious. As a result, market prices generally declined slightly by a few jiao, with unified tax falling by 6 jiao as the largest decline and issue 20 falling by 3 jiao as the smallest decline. The total turnover was only 3,677,000 yuan, of which spot goods only had Issue 20 turnover of 2,000 yuan, and futures salt tax also only traded 1.05 million. The rest only had 350,000, while compilation reserves only had 40,000 and 6,000,000 only had 20,000.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Monday, the New York stock market initially trended strong due to short covering and the fact that automobile king Stutz undertook the guardianship of the Stutz-Detroit Company and the First National Bank. However, the market situation suddenly collapsed, and the giants only slightly recovered before the close. It is difficult to explain why the market situation retraced, because there was no bad news, and the banking turmoil in Wohlhuter was also expected. The total turnover for the day was 1.25 million shares. The closing prices of several stocks are recorded below (unit: gold dollars). American Telephone and Telegraph 94.25, Bethlehem Steel 11, Case Agricultural Equipment 31, Chase Bank 24.25, Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Securities 55, Chrysler Motors 8.5, Curtiss Wright 10.75, Electric Power and Light 3.5, General Motors 10, International Telephone and Telegraph 5.25, Packard Motors 2, Citibank 8.5, American Tobacco 505, Quaker State Oil 4, Texaco Oil 11, Warner Brothers Pictures, Fox Films 1.5.

<p>Yarn sales are lower than before, and various firms have no active purchasing power. This is due to the weak economy and poor purchasing power. Furthermore, the inventory of cotton is gradually increasing in various locations. The Tianjin region is slightly engaged in arbitrage selling in Shanghai. As for the overseas cotton industry, the situation is becoming increasingly pessimistic. Additionally, military affairs in Jehol are becoming more serious, and financial conditions are tightening. The yarn sales situation is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Manbiao Futures Down 1.72 Taels</p>
<p>The Manbiao futures market opened in the morning with a slight increase in American cotton, and the market sentiment was flat. There was a lack of buyers. Prices for all months fell by 0.09 to 0.11 taels. In the afternoon, spot sales were even lower, and the market situation weakened. Prices for all months fell by 0.05 to 0.08 taels. The total trading volume for the day was 34,000 bales. Sales included 1,100 bales from Dafeng, 1,000 bales from Ruida, 2,050 bales from Shenji, 1,250 bales from Xiesheng, 950 bales from Yiyu, 700 bales from Deji, and 600 bales from Yuanda.

<p>Yarn Sales Decline Further</p>
<p>The clearance of yarn is slower than before, but yesterday's trading still reached over 1,000 bales. The total purchase volume by various firms for the day was 1,417 bales. Market prices were similar to the previous day. Purchase volumes for each firm are as follows:</p>
<p>Yunnan: 60 Wuhu: 15 Xiamen: 40</p>
<p>Ningbo: 7 Mainland: 87 Shantou: 547</p>
<p>Sichuan: 165 Fujian: 10 Peers: 10</p>
<p>Guangdong: 275 Jiangxi: 200</p>
<p>The cotton market is in a major decline, and the situation is weak. This is because the American cotton situation is sluggish, and a major financial panic has occurred in the United States, with many banks suspending operations. As a result, the local market sentiment is bearish. Sellers are taking the opportunity to move, and many are uneasy. However, some bulls remain strong and are holding firm. The yarn market is pessimistic, and factories have stopped purchasing raw materials.</p>

<p>Yesterday in Shanghai South (滬南), the strike by ship owners continued, and sources of supply were cut off. Although it was heard that the Social Affairs Bureau was mediating, no concrete solutions have been seen yet. Fortunately, transactions are few, and the market situation has not fluctuated much. The accumulated stock in the warehouses is gradually depleting, so the trading volume is extremely low. However, the market price is expected to continue to rise by 10 cents due to the shortage of goods. Recently, factories have released early rice and Yinyuan (陰元) rice, and the market situation is said to be good.</p>
<p>Yesterday in Shanghai North (滬北), only two or three boats of rice arrived from Jiangnan. Factories and warehouses continued to sell their stock. Baijing (白粳) rice continued to sell well, and the market was firm. Bojing (薄粳) early rice from Jiangnan is already out of stock. Yangchun (羊純) still has some in stock in Jiangnan, and retail sales are normal. Prices are stable. Customer demand is slightly weak. Baiyuan (白元) rice has become soft and stagnant. Today, the North-South Hundred Rice Firms Rice Group will hold a full meeting and will be closed for one day.</p>
<p>Wholesale Xian (秈) Rice Sales Are Brisk and Prices Are Gradually Increasing</p>
<p>Sales on this street are gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of wholesale Xian rice became scarce. Due to the unresolved strike, this street paid more attention to wholesale rice. Fuzhou merchants also took the opportunity to inquire. The market became more active and firm. The inventory of high-grade rice is low, and demand is strong. The market situation is becoming tighter, and prices are gradually increasing by 3 to 5 cents. Mid-grade rice prices remain firm. The total transaction volume for the day was over 2,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, priced at 8.75 to 8.76 yuan. Mid-grade rice was priced at 8.23 to 8.00 yuan. Old rice was priced at 7.555 yuan. 40 bags of Jiangxi Zhongguan Yuan rice were priced at 8.75 yuan. 160 bags of Nanjing Che Xian rice were priced at 7.79 yuan. 1,000 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice were priced at 8.67 to 8.56 yuan. 1,500 bags of machine-milled red rice were priced at 8.40 to 8.33 yuan. Fuzhou merchants purchased 300 to 400 bags each of Hunan machine-milled oil rice and Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, while the rest were purchased by this street.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the end of the month, and there was no trading in futures powder. The delivery for the end of this month has been completed, and the settlement has also been completed. However, most were directly withdrawn in cash outside the exchange. Only 2,000 bags of Lvpao (綠砲) brand powder were settled in the exchange.</p>
<h3 id="e182">53 Cars of Wheat Delivered <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's standard wheat delivery has been completed. A total of 50 cars of Australian wheat and 3 cars of wood wheat were delivered by merchants and were all received by China factories. Warehouse merchants and customers did not intervene.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain Market Is Neither Prosperous Nor Declining</p>
<p>The miscellaneous grain market situation shows no improvement. Although various firms are making purchases, their rise and fall cancel each other out, and it is difficult to see any major changes. Yesterday, the yellow bean market was slightly stable due to consecutive hard telegrams, which slightly lifted market sentiment. Wenzhou merchants exchanged over 300 bags of Liuhe green beans, and the market was still firm. Several hundred bags of Jiangbei Piaohei new arrivals were of very low quality and were purchased by mainland pig farmers. The total transaction volume yesterday was 200 bags, with an opening price of 3.98 taels. It is feared that the future market will be difficult to improve.</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Sugar Market: Zhangdiao and Dutch Sugar Down Another 10 Cents <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weak and showed no signs of improvement as the trading floor remained inactive. The association set the benchmark price for 4th grade coarse sand white sugar at 15.225 yuan, but no transactions were heard at the original price. Raw sugar was firm due to limited inventory, with a benchmark price of 14.05 taels and over a hundred bags sold. Dutch red sugar fell by 10 cents, with No. 8 at 11.90 taels and No. 9 at 12 taels, with few buyers. Chaoqing sugar showed little fluctuation, with the current opening price at 9.40 taels, dropping to 8.80 taels. The Zhangdiao green sugar benchmark price has not yet opened, and with the pressure from Chaoqing sugar, the weak trend is worsening. Yesterday, the German firm opened for sale 59 bags of ordinary goods, priced at 9.10 taels, which is 10 cents lower than before. Jianbing sugar's original price openings were not high. It was heard that Taiyuan sugar was imported through Xiamen, and there were some continued arrivals.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Arrival of Tong'an Dried Longan in Zhabei is Low, Leading to Price Increases <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of Tong'an dried longan this spring has been low. The Shanghai Zheng brand Tianhong stock price last winter was only 16 taels. The original offer opened in mid-month. Because the stock level is low, the trend is always tight. In addition, Xinghua's top-grade dried longan has risen, which has also boosted the price. It was heard that yesterday's market price rose by 50 cents compared to the previous market price, and the sub-brand increased by the same amount. The trend is lively and gradually stabilizes.</p>

<p>Due to the Sino-Japanese problem, Japanese silk merchants are actively selling off their stock in European and American markets, which has caused silk prices to continue to decline. Telegrams from other ports have rarely been sent to Shanghai. There is little hope for a turning point in silk sales in Europe and America in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Stronger Artificial Silk Delivery Volume <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the day for Shanghai's various registered firms to deliver artificial silk futures for February, which were thrown out by the various silk merchants. Foreign firms unloaded a large amount of futures for February. The total number of deliveries yesterday reached more than 800 boxes, mostly Italian goods.</p>

<p>Yesterday's hardware market showed mixed performance. Tinplate, black iron sheet, new lead wire, tinplate tiles, and small split nails showed signs of active sales. New foreign silver, bundled steel, new coiled steel, edge nails, large bars, etc. remained depressed. In terms of prices, tinplate increased by 20 cents, selling for 12.5 taels (90 pounds), and 200-pound double-linked iron opened at 29.5 taels (up 20 cents). There were few fluctuations in other goods. However, thin tinplate in the tinplate category was unusually firm yesterday. Therefore, locks and the market are showing signs of improvement. The current spot goods of the same industry are limited, and future arrivals are far away, so the estimated prices have risen to 95 cents (6 feet) and 1.14 taels (7 feet). It was found that the domestic rivers and the various Changjiang firms were very interested yesterday, so the transaction volume reached as high as 5,000 to 6,000 sheets. It is said that the Fujian Ningbo firms have also been inquiring in recent days, and the market is expected to rise and not fall.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Cutting <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>-- Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Suppose the world is a vast and boundless garden, with the large and small countries built on it like famous and exotic flowers planted in separate areas. Each has its own characteristics and advantages in color, fragrance, and posture. The flower beds are their territory, and the fences are their national defense lines. As long as flowers and flowers, grass and grass, respect each other's territorial integrity and do not break through each other's national defense lines, then the world's peaceful garden will certainly not have any unfortunate wars.</p>
<p>To maintain this peaceful garden, it is essential to prevent the possibility of weeds growing inside [Mans, difficult to plan for], this ancient saying means that people with ambitions are as terrible as weeds. Now, everyone hates ambitious countries, aren't they the world's pests? In South Manchuria, no one cut them off, and they spread to Central Manchuria and North Manchuria. Recently, they have intensified and spread to Yuguan and Jehol. If it is allowed to spread continuously, it will spread to the entire territory of China, and of course it will also spread to all countries in the world. Then, wouldn't the peaceful garden I described turn into a field of weeds?</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly passed the report of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee by a vote of forty-two to one, as if it were wielding a blade of justice and cutting at the power. However, with only one cut, its evil hatred still exists, and it is not known whether the old roots will sprout again in the future, or grow faster than before the cut. How should this be dealt with?</p>
<p>After cutting the weeds, the second step should be to remove its evil roots. The Zuo Zhuan says: "Sever its roots, do not allow it to be planted, then the good will flourish." However, the power of the forty-two countries is only applicable to the word "cut" and cannot talk about severing its roots. Why? The writing of the number forty-two is exactly the word "cut." I think that the forty-one countries, apart from a "cut" for the world's weeds, are afraid that there are no other effective methods.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Puppets and the Like of Anti-Chen Ping <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>-- Si Su</p>
<p>In the midst of the invading cries of violent Japan, the word "puppet" suddenly came into being, and almost every newspaper in the country, large and small, cannot do without it every day. In terms of the word puppet itself, is it considered to be successful or frustrated? It is also worth studying. Originally, everyone regarded the word puppet as a synonym for puppet shows, and there was no qualification to be put in newspapers. Puppet shows are stringed puppet shows. There are also several specialized performances in Shanghai, called what Sheng Wutai, Xin Wutai, which can be found in the entertainment list of major newspapers. It is not like Tianchan, Samsung, etc., with famous actors. After spending money to watch the show, you can write a drama review and put it in the newspaper. Who would be happy to comment on stringed puppet shows? Even if it is commented on, it has no value to be published. Therefore, before September 18th, it was really difficult to find puppets in the newspaper. After September 18th, it suddenly came into being, and newspapers kept reporting it. In itself, this must be considered a period of showing off, and one must be very happy! However, it is not so. If the puppet itself is conscious, it will never be happy. Unless the puppet has forgotten its ancestors, it will shamelessly regard this moment of excitement as its own happiness! Because the puppet's ancestor once performed the glorious meritorious service of "preserving the Han and repelling the barbarians." Yuefu Zalu says; "When Emperor Gaozu of the Han was surrounded by Maodun in Pingcheng, one side of the city was Maodun's wife, Que Shi, with strong soldiers on three sides, and the fortress was starving. Chen Ping visited and learned that Que Shi was jealous, so he made wooden puppets with organs and danced in the city walls. Que Shi was worried that if she attacked the city, Maodun would definitely accept prostitutes, so she withdrew his troops. Later, musicians turned it into a plaything, which is the puppet." Don't underestimate the puppet, it can lift the siege of Pingcheng and preserve the Han Dynasty. Today's puppets are doing the opposite, becoming the minions of the enemy, and dividing up the territory of the Han Dynasty. Are they doing this willingly? I am afraid not. Puppets are still puppets. However, those who make them are not Chen Ping, but the likes of Zheng Xiaoxu, Xi Qia, and Zhang Haipeng. The use of puppets is the opposite of those made by Chen Ping! Perhaps the puppet already understands that the excitement in front of them is only temporary, and they will be put away after a while and will no longer be seen in the newspaper. The likes of anti-Chen Ping are still dreaming, mistakenly thinking that joy can be prolonged!</p>

<p>-- He Chonglou</p>
<p>Is the Time of Creation</p>
<p>Youth, the color of grass, the active spring, symbolizes the period of people's youth. If we consider "spring" as the plan of a year, then "youth" is the plan of people's lives.</p>
<p>"Flowers fall and can bloom again, youth never returns." This is the feeling of most young people who worry about their youth being fleeting. Because of this feeling, it is easy to go down the road of indulging in pleasure, and as a result, their youth will perish even more quickly!</p>
<p>A person must make good use of their youth, because although youth is the shortest, it is the most powerful. We must know that "praise" or "lament" do not recognize the value of youth itself. Only by raising the hands of the masses, grasping the times, and creating great undertakings can we not fail to live up to the precious youth.</p>
<p>Friends: Do not hesitate, shoulder your responsibilities, and work hard to move forward!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Impressions of a Barbershop <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>-- Fei Ming</p>
<p>Shanghai is worthy of being a mysterious city with terrible temptations. As long as you pay attention everywhere, you will find scenes that you have never seen or heard of anywhere, and you will realize everything about life, society, and even the world from this. A barbershop is a place that is often easily overlooked but is filled with abundant information about life.</p>
<p>Indeed, barbershops in Shanghai can keep up with barbershops in many major cities in the world. Compared with barbershops in famous cities such as Moscow and Tokyo, not to mention anything else, just in terms of equipment and service, they have already surpassed them.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are various grades of barbershops in Shanghai. Personally speaking, I have visited barbershops ranging from one dime to one dollar. Sometimes I feel that cheaper barbershops can even give me an unexpected satisfaction than fancy barbershops.</p>
<p>However, to be honest, I still prefer to go to barbershops that are less ostentatious, for reasons that are difficult to explain in a word.</p>
<p>On that Sunday evening, rather than saying that I went to get a haircut, I might as well say that I went to find some material for writing short essays. I broke into a first-class barbershop on Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>Through the door, which released a wave of sweet and spicy perfume, I was led upstairs by the waiter. Unexpectedly, there was only me upstairs.</p>
<p>A smell of alcohol spewed out of the mouth of the barber, who was not wearing a mask, and I began to feel an unpleasant disappointment. [Bo Ai] sent over a small newspaper, and I sniffed it randomly. At this moment, with the sound of the upstairs bell, a wave of high-heeled leather shoes came up. Looking in the wall mirror, I saw three modern beauties with swirling smiles, led by the waiter to their seats. The fragrance in the room became even stronger.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I was the only member of the opposite sex among the customers present, I felt a kind of inexplicable joy. Driven by curiosity, I calmly observed the facial expressions of the three modern beauties in the mirror, and at the same time paid attention to listening to their laughter. Only then did I learn that they were going to participate in a charity performance to raise money to help the volunteer army.</p>
<p>Another unpleasant bell led up one or two drunken, fat foreign junior officers. They caught sight of the three Chinese modern beauties and revealed an extraordinary smile. From their conversation, it seemed that they heard a sentence: "Chinese women with a Western flavor." I silently thought: Why can't Westerners generally get rid of the image of bound feet when they imagine Chinese women?</p>
<p>Gradually, the dark hair in the mirror was waving. In another mirror, two pairs of unfamiliar green drunken eyes were peeking diagonally at the right side. My sensitive nerves seemed to be afraid that the female compatriots next to me would be attacked by unexpected misfortune, and I was willing to sit in the middle as their barrier.</p>
<p>The piercing whistling sound of a foreign tune began to become sharper. I suddenly saw that there were several strands of hair on the white cloth draped over my chest that spelled out the word "woman."</p>
<p>On the way home, I purely and secretly blessed the three hair-cutting girls!</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e193">Nine Flavor Tea <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>-- Zhang Yian</p>
<p>It is easy to describe the characters in a drama, but it is difficult to describe the real-life characters in society; because the characters in the drama are particularly exaggerated, and their characteristics are easy to see, while the characteristics of the real-life characters in society are not easy for you to see.</p>
<p>It is easy to describe the personality of Westerners, but it is difficult to describe the personality of Chinese people, because Westerners can often show their own personality, while Chinese people regard dissolving their own personality into the commonality of ordinary people as a kind of morality.</p>
<p>It is easier to describe the illiterate class characters in China than to describe the intellectual class characters, because in China, the intellectual class characters are good at hiding their egos, and the closer they are to cold and stiff things. (In fact, cold and stiff characters are not necessarily knowledgeable, and many are deliberately becoming cold and stiff, with unchanging expressions to show themselves as gentlemen.)</p>
<p>If you can pay attention to the grammar commonly used by ten people, you can find ten different language habits. Not only are the tones, words, and usage of words different, but even the organizational methods have their own personalities. Local environment and education level are probably the more important reasons.</p>
<p>Everyone inevitably has cheesy thoughts, but those who are more [elegant] will use their more [elegant] language to express them; those who are [more vulgar] will only use their more [vulgar] language and behavior.</p>
<p>A hypocritical and evasive person often has a stereotyped and unchanging expression. When he is socializing with people, he will show this unchanging expression.</p>
<p>Unmarried people always want to find a so-called lifelong partner, while married people cannot help but long for and reminisce about the freedom of single life.</p>
<p>At breakfast, I thought of something, and at the time I felt it was quite interesting, but I didn't record it. After the meal, I forgot to write it down. Later, when I tried to recall it, I completely forgot what it was. I don't know how many things like this that flash and disappear have been let go. In the future, if I feel something, I should write it down immediately.</p>
<p>Most of the people in Shanghai are smart. Even if they were not very smart originally, they would become too smart after being influenced by what they see and hear for a long time. However, I don't know what benefits this style of smart people has for the country and society.</p>
<p>Future education should pay attention to the correspondence between hands and brains, especially to the use of both hands. Scientific experiments and research, and industrial practice, must be done by hand. Thinking in vain, writing articles in vain, speaking in vain, shouting slogans in vain... the result is just in vain.</p>
<p>Schools in our country pay too little attention to the students' two hands, and their brains have not developed properly, which wastes many functions that should have been produced.</p>
<p>Emotions and thoughts are human, everyone has them, but it may not be possible for everyone to concretize them and say them or write them out.</p>
<p>The four corners of the tram car are the most coveted by passengers. When passengers are competing to sit in the corner seats, you can roughly understand the reason why warlords want to fight for territory. When passengers no longer compete to sit in the corner seats, I believe the warlords will no longer fight for territory. People have the habit of worshiping idols, and even more the ability to use idols. Some people respect creation and despise imitation. I think creation and imitation are connected. Creation is certainly valuable, but imitation is not to be blamed. From birth to adulthood, a person cannot get rid of going through many imitations. If imitation is blocked, there will be no learning, at least everyone will create a language that no one else can understand. If all imitation is blocked, then the result will inevitably become a primitive state. However, imitation should be regarded as a means of creation, which should be admitted.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Grandfather said, "We are not going back! Quickly destroy the bridge!" Indeed, judging from the current situation, if no one was willing to sacrifice their lives to resist the Japanese across the river, the wooden bridge would never have a chance to be destroyed; if the wooden bridge was not destroyed, Tianjia Village would immediately be trampled into flat ground by the Japanese. Therefore, when Xiaoling charged across the bridge, she did not plan to return.</p>
<p>Landlord Tian also knew the importance of this bridge, and the sacrifice of his two young grandchildren was even more clearly an inevitable fact. So, after closing his eyes and riding his horse across the bridge, he resolutely ordered the fifth son, hiding in the inner room, to immediately destroy the wooden bridge.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese had divided into two groups, encircling Xiaohe and Xiaoling like dumplings.</p>
<p>Across the river, the old man straightened his back, sitting upright on his horse like a zombie, his eye sockets widened as much as possible, almost to the point of cracking; the water on his face, in the dim twilight, gleamed brightly, but no one knew whether it was sweat or tears; and even those two iron arms, wielding knives and swords and killing like hemp, could not stop trembling.</p>
<p>The Japanese were temporarily not preparing to rush into the river, determined to first deal with these two young martyrs who took death as the price for killing. A chaotic sound of killing shook the wilderness. Initially, people on this side could still vaguely see two things like wheels in the heavy encirclement of the Japanese, constantly rolling, rising, and colliding actively; sometimes they could even hear the wails of the Japanese after being shot, and the tragic and passionate roars of Xiaoling and Xiaohe... Gradually, the sound of the Japanese killing overwhelmed everything, and the forest-like array of knives was no longer seen moving.</p>
<p>The night wind passed through the willow forest, making a long howl like a monkey's cry, as if mourning the little warrior who was unyielding until death.</p>
<p>"Ah! Father! We can't just sit by and watch without saving them!" The fifth son, the only one remaining uninjured among the Tian family's soldiers, could not bear it and pleaded with Landlord Tian in a hoarse voice, advocating that everyone charge across the river again to rescue Xiaoling and them.</p>
<p>"No! No! No!" Landlord Tian tried his best to hold onto his wildly beating heart, endured all the pain, and burst out with an extremely resolute answer from between his teeth. (Seven)</p>

<p>Authorities Discover a Major Communist Conspiracy</p>
<p>Martial Law in Berlin, a Large Number of Communists Arrested</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, February 28th Hindenburg recently signed a new order. According to the order, Germany will implement an absolute dictatorship and assist it with de facto martial law. The order cancels the articles in the Weimar Constitution that guarantee personal freedom, the right to freely express opinions, freedom of the press, the right to hold meetings and organize societies, the secrecy of letters, telegrams, and telephones, and authorizes the central government to take over the administrative affairs of any state that neglects to restore order. Anyone who attempts to assassinate the president or cabinet members, or commits serious cases such as disrupting public order, rebellion, arson, poisoning, or damaging railways, will be sentenced to death. The order also cancels the articles in the constitution that guarantee the safety of criminals' residences from search, confiscation, and investigation, and orders the authorities of each state to obey the instructions of the central government and implement all orders. The order also stipulates that anyone who commits crimes against public safety or opposes the state must be sentenced to long-term imprisonment or hard labor. Currently, 130 well-known members of the Communist Party and some non-Communist Party members have been taken into custody. The Prussian authorities claimed today that the Communist Party's grand conspiracy to overthrow the current government by force has been discovered and is undoubtedly true. Therefore, they should take the most severe plan to contain the party. When the Berlin Communist Party headquarters was searched, false orders were found addressed to police officers and Nazi stormtroopers, ordering them to put poison in food and drinking water when riots broke out, and to place women and children in front of the "terrorist" groups, and to set fire to various government offices, museums, palaces, factories, and start a regular civil war. According to the authorities, it is now confirmed that the Communist Party has dressed in police and Nazi stormtrooper uniforms and committed acts of rioting in order to attract public hatred. The real leader of this terrorist organization is actually Mu Zengpei, a Communist Party member of the House of Representatives. The police are currently searching for him. The police are now armed and patrolling the areas of Berlin where riots frequently occur by car. All the police in Prussia have been ordered to be on duty day and night to prepare for dispatch until the general election on March 5.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, February 28th Police authorities ordered tonight that all cafes, dance halls, and taverns in Berlin must close at midnight, starting tonight and with no fixed deadline.

<p>Reuters, Berlin, February 28th The site where the Reichstag was burned has been inspected by experts. Today, the members believe that the fire could not have been caused by one person alone. Police authorities also believe that the Dutch Communist Lubai, who was arrested, must have had an assistant, but Lubai has denied it. According to a certain newspaper of the Dutch Communist Party, Lubai was expelled from the party two years ago for committing violence. According to a Reichstag waiter, he saw Lubai talking to two Communist Party members last night, and the two immediately left. One of them was the Communist Party leader Torgler, who turned himself in to the police today and was taken into custody. Many parts of the Reichstag building have been completely destroyed, and it is now believed that it will take at least eight months to repair.</p>

Because overseas Chinese-run elementary schools have 25 hours per week dedicated to teaching Siamese, there is no time left to teach Chinese. Moreover, Siamese cannot be used outside of Siam, while Chinese is used in all Chinese-populated areas in the East for correspondence and accounting. Therefore, a meeting was held to decide to petition the Siamese government to reduce the Siamese teaching time to 15 hours per week, so that there will be time to learn Chinese.</p>

<p>Curbing Freedom of Speech and Assembly</p>
<p>Disruptive Behavior Punishable by Death</p>
<p>Authorities Discover Major Communist Conspiracy</p>
<p>Martial Law in Berlin, Large Number of Communists Arrested</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 28th - President Hindenburg has signed a new decree, according to which Germany will implement an absolute dictatorship, assisted by de facto martial law. The decree repeals the articles of the Weimar Constitution guaranteeing individual freedom, the right to freely express opinions, freedom of the press, the right to hold meetings and organize associations, the secrecy of letters, telegrams, and telephone calls, and authorizes the central government to take over the administrative affairs of any state that fails to restore order. Anyone who attempts to assassinate the president or cabinet members, or commits serious crimes such as disrupting public order, rebellion, arson, poisoning, or damaging railways, will be sentenced to death. The decree also repeals the provisions in the constitution guaranteeing the safety of the homes of criminals from searches, confiscation, and investigation, and orders the state authorities to obey the instructions of the central government and implement all orders. The decree also stipulates that anyone who commits crimes that disrupt public security or oppose the state shall be sentenced to long-term imprisonment or hard labor. One hundred and thirty prominent members of the Communist Party, and some non-Communist Party members, have been taken into custody. Prussian authorities announced today that the great conspiracy of the Communist Party to overthrow the current government by force has been discovered without a doubt. Therefore, the most severe plan should be taken to curb the party. During the search of the Berlin Communist Party headquarters, counterfeit orders were found addressed to police officers and members of the Nazi Sturmabteilung, ordering them to put poison in food and water during riots, and to place women and children in the front ranks of [terror] groups, and to set fire to various government offices, museums, palaces, and factories to start a regular civil war. According to authorities, it is now certain that the Communist Party has worn police and Nazi Sturmabteilung uniforms to carry out riotous acts in order to provoke public hatred. The real leader of this terrorist organization is actually Communist member of the Reichstag Muezenberg, who has now fled and is being hunted by the police. The police, armed with weapons, are patrolling the various districts of Berlin where riots often occur. All Prussian police officers are ordered to be ready to be dispatched day and night until after the general election on March 5th.</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 28th - Police authorities tonight ordered all cafes, dance halls, and bars in Berlin to close at midnight, effective tonight and without a set deadline. Usually, they have to close at 3 a.m. The owners are complaining, as this measure will cause them significant losses.</p>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 28th - The site of the burning of the Reichstag has been inspected by experts. Today, the officials believe that the fire could not have been caused by one person alone. Police authorities also believe that the arrested Dutch communist, Lubbe, must have had accomplices, but Lubbe denies it. According to a Dutch communist newspaper, Lubbe was expelled from the party two years ago for violence. According to a Reichstag waiter, he saw Lubbe talking to two Communist members of the Reichstag last night, and the two immediately left. One of the two is the Communist leader Torgler, who surrendered to the police station today and is in custody. Many parts of the Reichstag building were completely destroyed, and it is now believed that it will take at least eight months to repair.</p>
<p>Havas Berlin, 28th - The damage from the fire at the Federal Reichstag is not as bad as people say. From the outside, it does not appear to have been on fire. Inside, only the furniture and part of the paneling in the assembly hall were destroyed. The central dome is completely undamaged.</p>

<p>May I dare to ask, all agencies, organizations, schools, companies, pay attention! Since the birth of the Zuo Xin Manufacturing Factory national product duplicator, enemy goods spirit duplicators have suffered a blow. Since the sales of Gao Le Factory stencil paper raw paper of the friendly country of Austria, enemy goods stencil paper have even disappeared without a trace. It can be seen that excellent materials are actually better than enemy goods. The Gao Le stencil paper raw paper and Zuo Xin spirit duplicator really have several major characteristics! One, stencil paper—the material is strong and tough, and will not break after long printing. Two, steel plate—the mesh pattern is fine and dense, and both sides can be used.</p>
<p>Three, stylus—the tip is round and smooth, and will not damage the stencil paper. Four, spirit duplicator—convenient and solid, lacquered and elegantly decorated.</p>
<p>With the above advantages, there's no need to use spirit duplicators and stencil paper. If you need to purchase them, aside from Gao Le stencil paper and Zuo Xin spirit duplicator, come!!!</p>

<p>The So-Called Emergency Period Only Causes Social Unrest</p>
<p>The Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet Is Fierce but Controlled by the Military</p>
<p>What the fate of the Japanese Empire will be, even the Satsuma and Choshu clans, which are baring their teeth and claws, annexing Manchuria, attacking Jehol, and firmly contending for the South Seas, cannot figure it out. However, they all feel that the current situation is very dangerous, so they have to adopt a military adventurous policy, hoping to use external military actions as a smokescreen to cover up the ugly situation in their own country. The Tokyo municipal gas bribery case, the riot plans of right-wing groups, the prosperity and growth of left-wing thought... all have an economic downturn as their background, which brewed into the so-called emergency period. Originally, the explanation for the emergency period should be a period of war. Japan neither admits to aggressive invasion nor has formally declared war on our China on the surface, so how can it be said to be an [emergency]? However, if we examine the situation in Japan—especially after the assassination of Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai by active-duty army and navy officers on May 15th last year—the social unrest is indeed reminiscent of wartime. Moreover, there are in fact small-scale wars every day in the three northeastern provinces of China, and large-scale wars are being prepared for in Jehol, eastern Mongolia, and even the Pacific Ocean. The military expenditure for this year has even reached 820 million yen, accounting for 36.5% of the national treasury expenditure of 2.239 billion yen. There is no doubt that it is a quasi-wartime budget expenditure. No one in Japan does not harbor the fear of the descent of the god of war. Although the military advocates various high-sounding arguments and at the same time suppresses speech (in addition to legal restrictions, it also adds the central force of reserve soldiers' associations and other government-controlled groups as forces to coerce public opinion, and casually adds the notoriety of disloyalty to the emperor and unpatriotism, and persecutes them), the awareness of [non-war] is very strong among the people, but it is obscured by the military's war advocacy.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the mission of Saito Makoto's [emergency period] cabinet should be to overcome Japan's current crisis, overcome the anxiety of the general public, and bring the invasion of China to an end. Then it can be said that it has passed through the emergency period and entered a normal state. But everyone understands that the anxiety of Japanese society is unfolding along with the economic panic of capitalism. How can Japan go beyond the scope of capitalism and cast a world of its own? The more the scope of invasion expands, the more difficulties Japan has. The more troops are used, the more difficult the financial problem becomes. The more military spending provokes international dark clouds, the more intense it becomes. For example, with the proposal of the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen's recommendation, the military's strategy in the diplomatic isolation that Japan has fallen into insists on intensifying the invasion and expanding the scope of the war. From Fengtian to Rehe and eastern Mongolia, let's see what the League of Nations will do. What can the United States do to it? China seems to be even less in its sights, so it only wants to safely occupy Rehe with just over two divisions of troops.</p>
<p>Therefore, the more Saito's cabinet wants to overcome the emergency period, the more serious the emergency period becomes. Social unrest increases, and external wars are even more urgent. However, the political contradictions unfold instead, and the movements to overthrow the cabinet among the factions are still very fierce. First, the military is dissatisfied with the policy. Second, the Seiyukai wants to organize a party cabinet. Third, the Minseitō faction supports Uga Kiyoshi's movement.</p>
<p>The military's policy is indeed dissatisfied with the current cabinet's soft handling. However, Saito is a [nice guy] who does not put forward his own ideas very much, and can let the ministers of each department develop freely. Of course, there is even less of a problem for the army, which looks down on everyone. Moreover, Saito Makoto is also a senior member of the navy, so there has been no active expression of dissatisfaction with him on the part of the army. However, the general public of the Kokumin Domei wants to get close to the political power, so it tries to get close to the army faction and prepares to support Hiranuma Kiichiro, who belongs to the Araki faction, to form a cabinet. But the League of Nations problem has arisen, and it has more political difficulties. I am afraid this is not easy to achieve. Moreover, the fascist cabinet is not supported by financial capital and landlords. As for Yasuda Uchida taking the stage with the military, that is even less likely.</p>
<p>The Seiyukai has an absolute majority of seats, and according to the common sense of parliamentary politics, it should be ordered to form a cabinet, but in the so-called emergency period, the constitution is under the iron heels of the military, so let alone [constitutional convention]. The current cabinet, Saito, has not only not overcome the so-called emergency period, but the war has become even more urgent. The Seiyukai, which is weak and incompetent and hated by the people, must pass through the military, subdue the Minseitō and the Kokumin Domei to control the political power. Moreover, the Tokoji (Takejiro) system and the Kuhara (Fusanosuke) system are mutually opposed (within the Seiyukai itself) and are not under the jurisdiction of President Suzuki, so the possibility of it forming a cabinet must be reduced.</p>
<p>The Minseitō's support for Uga Kiyoshi is a very clever strategy. It can both use it to resist Araki and prevent military dictatorship. Moreover, Uga can also get a lot of sympathy among the military, and has a good impression on the elder statesmen of the upper class. However, the young and vigorous Araki faction will definitely strongly oppose it, especially at a time when they are about to use troops in Rehe, how can Uga intervene? Then, although the Minseito's policy is clever, I am afraid it will not have much practical effect.</p>
<p>Judging from the current political situation, Saito's cabinet is indeed shaking, but it is more suitable than the Suzuki of the Seiyukai and the Hiranuma, who has the tacit agreement of the military. It also has more harmony than Uga, so Saito's cabinet may not fall in the current situation of opposition between factions and diplomatic urgency. However, the possibility of it being reorganized and becoming a [strong] cabinet under the influence of the military is indeed very high, otherwise a purely military cabinet will be established. No matter who comes forward (whether it is Uchida or the others), it does not matter, in fact, it must be completely controlled by the military to be able to cope with the current situation and implement the military's proposed aggressive policy.

<h3 id="e245">International Disadvantage After Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>A Tokyo Asahi Shimbun correspondent in Geneva reported that since the failure of conciliation, the temporary general meeting, which included a report of a recommendatory nature as a resolution, has considered Japan's withdrawal from the League to be inevitable. However, the relationship of the entire world to Japan after its withdrawal, according to the opinion of the chief authority of the branch office of our company (Asahi Shimbun) in Geneva, is summarized as follows: (1) The United Kingdom has recently been quite close to China, and is trying its best to contain the actions of the Japanese army, affecting the Tianjin area. However, the United Kingdom is quite suspicious of the United States' attitude. If the United Kingdom obtains the consent of the United States to the report, it can increase the League's assistance in the handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Military action in Rehe is very dangerous internationally, but Japan's withdrawal from the League must be realized after giving two years' notice. However, it is questionable whether Japan can fulfill all its international and League obligations (in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant) after withdrawal. From the League's point of view, although Japan is not subject to the General Assembly's report with Article 15 of the Covenant as the limit, Japan should faithfully fulfill the obligation to guarantee territorial integrity and political independence in accordance with Article 10 in its actions in Manchuria. On the one hand, Japan's withdrawal from the League is not desired by the League, but if Japan repents of its withdrawal within two years before the expiration of the term, and returns to the League to succeed to the seat of a permanent member of the council, it is feared that it cannot. Therefore, if Japan rashly withdraws from the League, it will forever lose the right to the seat of a permanent member of the council, and because Japan is listed in the position of a permanent member, it can still interfere in various European problems. If it withdraws from the League, it will lose its world position. As for practical matters, after Japan withdraws from the League, international finance will cut off relations with Japan, and the countries of the League will passively reject Japan. Japan will not be able to raise foreign debt, and Japan will lose all sources of assistance in finance. In addition, the oppression of Japanese goods in various countries around the world has caused serious blows because of the low exchange rate with Japan. Today, various countries are only using tariffs as a strategy to resist Japanese goods. If Japan withdraws and breaks away from its relationship with the League, various countries can avoid the dumping of Japanese goods. At the same time, by quoting Article 16, Paragraph 4, it can remove Japan from the list. If so, Japanese goods will not be able to be dumped freely in the markets of various countries.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Tian Songyao Fully Suppresses the Communist Bandits <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Abandoning All of Chengdu and Deploying to the Front Line</p>
<p>Liu Xiang and Yang Sen Also Send Troops to Assist in the Suppression</p>
<p>Sichuan Army Takes Over Defense of Western Hubei Area</p>
<p>Chongqing Air Mail, the Communist bandits occupied Bazhong, Chengkou, Wanyuan, Nanjiang, Tongjiang, Zhaohua, Guangyuan, Pengxi, and other places in northwestern Sichuan Province. In addition to establishing a false central government and a Sichuan Provisional Soviet Government, each county also established a false Soviet County Government, and townships and villages also established Soviet offices. Xu Xiangqian, Kuang Jiqie, and other bandit leaders, in order to open up an international route, also developed towards Gansu, trying to contact Soviet Russia. It is heard that Tian Songyao, the Sichuan and Shaanxi Bandit Suppression Director, in addition to sending elite troops to suppress the bandits, also decided to completely abandon the interests in Chengdu, concentrating more than 50,000 troops in Bao Ning, Bazhong, Zhao Guang, and other places in northwestern Sichuan to fully suppress them. However, the Red bandits adopted tactics of guerrilla warfare, and used young people as the vanguard, so Tian's suppression has not made progress. Tian felt that his military strength was insufficient, and also due to the lack of pay, he was in a dilemma. At the same time, because of the disagreement between Wei Naixian, commander of the 3rd Division of Tian's forces, and Li Weiruo, commander of the 1st Route, they have been mutually slandering each other since the start of the campaign, and have been hesitant to move forward, resulting in mistakes. Currently, Tian is trying to strengthen the internal unity of the army in order to facilitate the suppression of the bandits. The 24th Army Liu Wenhui, the 28th Army Deng Xihou, and the Sichuan and Shaanxi Army Liu Cunhou have all dispatched troops to assist Tian's army with weapons and pay to launch a general mobilization. It is heard that Liu Xiang and Yang Sen have decided to each send 15 regiments to set off for northern Sichuan. Yang has appointed Xia Jiong as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression, and Liu has appointed Guo Xun as the bandit suppression commander, to assist Tian's army as appropriate. Liu Xiang also sent two bombers and two reconnaissance planes to the bandit area to assist, hoping to wipe out the Communist bandits completely in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The area of western Hubei was previously occupied by the Red bandits. Chairman Chiang specifically telegraphed the 21st Army Liu Xiang to send troops to assist in the suppression. At the same time, the central government appointed Liu as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and demarcated 18 counties in western Hubei for Liu to administer. When the Sichuan war broke out, Liu Xiang transferred the bandit suppression troops in western Hubei, totaling more than 18,000 people, completely back to Sichuan to participate in the civil war. The area of western Hubei was then taken over by Xu Yuandong's troops dispatched by Chairman Chiang. Recently, the remnants of the Red bandits He Long, Duan Dechang, etc., have again disturbed the area of Hefeng and Badong, so Chairman Chiang has again ordered Liu Xiang to send troops to take over the defense of the western Hubei area and jointly suppress the bandits. Recently, Liu has assembled troops, preparing to go to Hubei to take over the defense. (February 27th)</p>

However, late last night, Director Guo suddenly received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating that in the face of national crisis, everything should be kept simple, and instructing that the opening ceremony be postponed. After receiving the telegram, Director Guo immediately notified this newspaper to inform all walks of life to avoid making a special trip. A reporter inquired with the factory this afternoon, and was told that the opening ceremony has been decided to be postponed, but the formal start of minting will still be carried out at 3:00 PM today, and tea and refreshments will be prepared for guests from all walks of life to visit the contents and work of various departments.</p>

<p>The reporter first went to the factory this afternoon.</p>
<p>Guided and instructed by Technician Zhang Deqing, they first went to the smelting workshop. The workers were busy with smelting work, putting silver blocks into pots, covering them with coal dust to isolate them from the air and reduce consumption. After the silver blocks were 880 parts per thousand, they were poured into silver bars, which were then rolled into thin sheets using a rolling mill, and then cut short. They were then placed in a blanking machine and stamped into a round shape, and then placed in an oven to heat them for printing. After heating, they were put back into a polishing machine until they were clean and bright. First, the edges were rolled, then the flowers were printed, and the silver dollars were made. Fearing the disadvantage of light and heavy, they were then corrected by a calibrator, and the lighter ones were removed. The silver shavings after smelting were then re-refined in a scrap grinding machine. The factory has a total of 186 workers. The working hours are from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm every day. According to Mr. Zhang, the number of coins manufactured each day has not yet been determined.</p>

The front is a portrait of the Premier, with the words "Republic of China, Year 21" at the top. The reverse is a sand gull and a sailboat, with the words "One Yuan" on both sides.</p>

<p>The factory has not yet received orders from the ministry, so it has not yet decided whether to allow free coinage or national coinage. Therefore, it has not been possible to contact copper shops or other sectors to commission coinage. Although the new coins have been minted, they cannot be put into circulation because the Legislative Yuan has not yet passed the currency law.</p>

The Italian postal company in this port has hired a small steamship to welcome passengers to the port at that time. It is scheduled to land at the Customs Wharf. Many relatives and friends in Shanghai have received the news and went to the company to inquire about the time of arrival, preparing to welcome him.</p>

<p>Evacuation to Dalian</p>
<p>Japanese nationals in various ports in North China have been evacuated one after another. Japanese residents in Qingdao have also received orders to prepare to leave. The Dalian Steamship Company's Otomaru has received an order from the Japanese authorities to be transferred to Qingdao to load all the luggage and items of the Japanese people there in preparation for evacuation. At present, the items of the Japanese people in Qingdao will be transported to Dalian first. The Tianjin Maru has already been used as a special ship for transporting Japanese nationals.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Haizhou liner Jiahe set sail from Dapu and returned to Shanghai. When it reached the front of the Dazhen Company Wharf, the tide was receding and the Jiahe tried its best to sail outwards. At that time, a large sand ship, No. 437, was parked near the wharf. The Jiahe's hull could not avoid it, causing it to collide with the sand ship, damaging the hull of the sand ship. The Jiahe came to Shanghai. The amount of loss of the damaged sand ship will be investigated by Shen Youzhi, the director of the Haizhou Branch, and then negotiate with the shipowner on the issue of compensation.</p>

<p>I Will Depart After the Reorganization Plan for Sichuan Is Decided</p>
<p>Visited Duan Qirui Last Night and Met Representative Liu This Morning</p>
<p>The Central Government Hopes That Feng Yuxiang Will Go South Immediately</p>
<p>Zhang Qun, a member of the Central Committee, went to Nanchang to meet Chairman Jiang and returned to Beijing. He came to Shanghai a few days ago. This morning, the reporter visited Mr. Zhang at his private residence and learned that the Jiang bandits had been surrounded by the Central Army. Mr. Zhang's trip to Sichuan will not be scheduled until the central reorganization plan is decided. The following is a record of Mr. Zhang's conversation.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Bandit Suppression Issue <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang said that the situation of the Jiang bandits has been quite serious since the end of last year. After the elimination of bandits in northern Hubei, Chairman Jiang and Minister He returned to Beijing, causing the bandit suppression work in Jiangxi Province to be slightly suspended, and the bandits became rampant. Later, Chairman Jiang went to Jiangxi on January 27 at the request of all parties. At that time, he originally planned to return to Wuhan after completing the arrangements, but after inspecting Jiangxi, he felt that it was necessary to suppress the bandits severely, so he decided to divide the army into three routes to suppress them. The eastern route was led by Cai Tingkai, the southern route was led by Yu Hanmou, and the central route was led by Chen Cheng to encircle and suppress the bandits. When Yu arrived in Jiangxi on the 20th, the plan had been completely decided. On the 25th, Yu left Nanchang and had already made contact with the bandit army. Their base covers 13 counties, and their activities cover 45 counties, so it may not be easy to eliminate them in a short time, but after a severe attack, they can be completely eliminated.</p>

<p>As for the reorganization of Sichuan politics, we must wait for the Executive Yuan to formulate measures based on the reorganization plan for Sichuan politics in the Republic of China in the 17th year. I have also submitted a suggestion, asking the central government to discuss it. The Central Political Conference was held on the 21st of last month. I did not participate because I went to Nanchang. I don't know the outcome of the discussion. I will definitely wait until there are concrete measures before going to Sichuan.</p>

<p>Deng Hanxiang, the representative of Sichuan, Liu Xiang, visited Mr. Zhang at 9:00 this morning and talked for about an hour before leaving after 10:00. According to Mr. Zhang, Deng came to inquire about Chairman Jiang's views on Sichuan affairs.</p>

<p>I visited Mr. Duan Qirui last night and had no mission. Mr. Duan's position on Japan is very clear, that is, if the Japanese do not withdraw from the Northeast that they have occupied, negotiations cannot be held. Mr. Duan's leg disease has relapsed, and his trip to Hangzhou has been postponed. His family is about to come to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Regarding the report of Feng Yuxiang's trip to the south, Mr. Zhang said that when I went to Nanchang to meet Chairman Jiang, Feng's representative Huang Shaogu had already gone, so I don't know the details of their contact, but the central government hopes that Feng can go south very much, because in this time of national crisis, the whole country should unite to resist foreign insults, said Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang finally told reporters that he would not leave Shanghai for the time being.</p>

<p>The Real Estate Association Will Issue a Declaration</p>
<p>After the British-owned water company forcibly cut off the water supply to 29 places including Sanxingfang and Jingyuli in eastern Shanghai, it has been delayed until now for nearly a month. Although the parties concerned have been in contact recently, they have not been able to obtain considerable results. The Municipal Council is also very anxious because water is a daily necessity of life. The board of directors will also put this matter forward for discussion at 4:30 this afternoon to seek an early solution. The Real Estate Association also believes that if this stalemate continues, the tenants will suffer from the water cutoff because the owners cannot solve the water bill, and they intend to temporarily suspend the saying of village housing rents. The association will issue a declaration today to announce to all sectors of society, and will publish the photos taken by the water company's workers and Chinese and Western detectives when they forcibly cut off the water, in order to expose the company's atrocities and make the world understand the truth.</p>

<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Areno Gaku, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China, at the Japanese Consulate General's Office yesterday (the 28th) afternoon, and asked whether the embassy had any measures to stop the recent behavior of Japanese nationals along the Yangtze River who were trying to escape the rules. According to Areno, there are about 2,000 Japanese pseudo-nationals in the Yangtze River area. Recently, in view of the increasingly tense situation between China and Japan, they have no choice but to defend themselves in everything. In order to restrain them, the embassy has instructed the consulates in various places to inform the local Japanese nationals to act prudently. As for the rumors that Japanese nationals from Beijing and Jiangsu have come to Shanghai one after another, the embassy has not received this report. Even if there are any, they are individual actions.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Rehe, people all over the country have been paying attention to it. The Shanghai YMCA has launched a lecture series on the Rehe problem from this Wednesday, for a total of 36 lectures, held every evening at 7:00 in the auditorium of the YMCA at Baxianqiao. The speakers on the first day (March 1st) are Mr. Huang Renzhi, who has just returned from Rehe, and Mr. Zang Zhexian, the former mayor of Tianjin. The speakers on the second day (March 2nd) are Mr. Xiong Bingsan. The speakers on the third day (March 3rd) are Mr. Chen Liting and Mr. Chen Binhe. Among the three days, the first and second days are the most important, because Mr. Xiong and Mr. Huang have just come to Shanghai from Rehe, and they will have detailed reports on the recent situation there. Those who care about national affairs should not miss listening to them.</p>

<p>Ren Runsheng, a Taiwanese man, 37 years old, who lives at No. 11 Ren'an Lane, Ge Luo Road (ie Songshan Road), in the French Concession, is engaged in real estate business and has accumulated some wealth, which has been coveted by bandits. At about 11:00 this morning, five bandits broke into the back door of the house. Three of them were armed with pistols, threatening and intimidating the victims. They were robbed of four diamond rings, cash, and clothes, etc., with an estimated loss of more than 1,000 yuan. Because the police station was nearby, the bandits were afraid that the detectives would hear the news and rush over, so they quickly escaped from the front door. Afterwards, the victim reported to the nearby police station and asked them to investigate. After receiving the report, the police chief ordered the detectives to go to investigate and arrest them separately.</p>

<h3 id="e269">[The Law of Nature] <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>According to a certain evening newspaper yesterday, the New York Times' Beijing telegram said, "[Retired Japanese Imperial Army Lieutenant General] Banzai told a New York Times reporter that the Manchurian people's attitude towards [Manchukuo] is that he believes that [Manchukuo's] self-proclaimed territory can at most only represent a country that once had a national emblem. His opinion is completely different from that of the Japanese military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but he firmly believes that Japan will eventually return Manchuria to China. The reason is that [Manchukuo has 30 million people, but they are not truly pure Manchurians,] but [they are all only Chinese,] so [when the Chinese provinces enter a period of peace and order, they will return their individuals and all their land] to China according to the law of nature and necessity." (The above quotations are all from the original text)</p>
<p>China is really fortunate. The land lost by man will actually be returned according to the [law of nature] with [unexpected wonderful effects]. And these words came from the mouth of a [Japanese Imperial Army Lieutenant General], which is even more precious, enough to make the [generals who rely entirely on fate rejoice] and wait quietly for the [final] [return]! Even if they are unlucky enough not to witness it, they can only blame their own short lives and cannot complain that the period is too long.</p>
<p>Finally, what I should be grateful for is that reading this section of the news last night completely dispelled my usual excessive worries and gave me a good night's sleep. Its effectiveness is really no less than [sleeping pills]. I think I can always sleep more soundly from now on—even if I have gentle spring dreams, they will be longer. Here, I cannot but thank this [long-term resident of China], [wearing] [Chinese clothes], [speaking the extremely pure Chinese of Pu Yi's] [close friend], who is not only regarded as a confidant and grateful by the generals who generally advocate the theory of fate!</p>
<p>[Manchukuo's] self-proclaimed territory [now] can at most only represent a country that once had a national emblem." I can swear that I extremely believe this—this is the [law of nature].</p>

<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>An old friend from Gansu, Mr. Deng, sent a letter with a poem in the five-character ancient style, "Sending Coal to Refugees in Hualin Mountain After Snow," which was very tragic. It is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Alas, ancient Hugan,</p>
<p>Years of drought and dryness,</p>
<p>How can the people of vegetable color,</p>
<p>Also encounter the chaos of Huamen,</p>
<p>Villages suddenly become ruins,</p>
<p>Wives and children are all scattered,</p>
<p>Travelers cry on the poor road,</p>
<p>Residents dissect their bones,</p>
<p>Fortunately, the great government is virtuous,</p>
<p>Hualin is like a teaching hall,</p>
<p>Thin porridge can continue life,</p>
<p>Better than soberingly灌灌,</p>
<p>Why is the Creator unkind,</p>
<p>The climate suddenly changes,</p>
<p>Flying snow invades the cold bed,</p>
<p>Sharp wind breaks paper curtains,</p>
<p>Alas, I am a man in distress,</p>
<p>Short clothes do not reach the shanks,</p>
<p>Children cry and wail,</p>
<p>How to spend the night,</p>
<p>Dare to fight against hunger and cold,</p>
<p>I am afraid that life and death will be judged,</p>
<p>Moved by this, I cannot sleep,</p>
<p>I sigh three times in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>To seek temporary peace,</p>
<p>First give a lump of charcoal,</p>
<p>And ask philanthropists,</p>
<p>To give generously and make great wishes,</p>
<p>Common Sense of the Protection Method of Steam Boiler Slaves</p>
<p>Since the explosion of the boiler in Zhengtai No. 1 Rubber Factory, which resulted in the death and injury of more than 200 workers, the news has spread, shocking the whole of Shanghai. The local authorities also pay close attention to it because it concerns the safety of the people. The reporter believes that it is too late to dwell on the past, and we can learn from the future. I hope that those who run industrial factories in the future will not be greedy for immediate gains and treat human lives like grass. They should prepare sufficient industrial knowledge to avoid such a major disaster again. It is fortunate among misfortunes. Now, the protection method of steam boilers is described as follows for reference.</p>
<p>The method of protecting boilers is the same as protecting the human body. The first is to keep it clean, so that the minerals contained in the water do not stay in the boiler, so that the surroundings form lumps, reducing the heat transfer power of the iron. Therefore, on the one hand, the water used must be filtered, and on the other hand, the inside of the boiler must be wiped clean once a week. Even the chimney must be cleaned at any time. In addition to cleaning, the second important thing is to pay attention to the number of degrees in the water ting. For example, a furnace that can burn 105 degrees has a cold water pump of 50 pounds, and the water ting burned is only 70 degrees to 90 degrees, which is very appropriate. If it is burned to 120 degrees or 115 degrees, and the pressure valve is also at 120 degrees, then there is a great danger, just like a person who can only carry a load of 100 pounds is asked to carry a weight of 150 pounds, how can he not be overturned? Therefore, we must pay close attention and urge the stoker to check the safety valve at any time.</p>
<p>Other things to pay attention to are the water gauge. If the water in the water gauge is more than an inch high, we open the third valve, and air and water will spray out, which can prove that there is a considerable amount of water in the boiler. If we hold the mouth of the spray with our hands, there is only gas and no water. This is a sign that the water in the boiler is about to run out. At this time, if we do not reduce the heat and pour in a fixed amount of water, the iron plate screws at the bottom of the boiler will first be melted and fall off, and even the boiler will explode.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the small steam pipe leading to the water gauge, the small hole at the end of the pipe, is blocked by dirt in the water, causing the water gauge to lose its effectiveness. Often, no water comes out when the valve is opened, but there is still water in the boiler, or there is water when it is sprayed out, but the boiler has dried up, so we must pay attention.</p>
<p>A boiler can only be used for a maximum of ten years. After a certain period of time, even if the good furnace does not show any pathological conditions on the surface, its material has actually lost its effectiveness. Generally, people who are greedy for immediate gains still cherish such waste and are unwilling to discard it, and eventually repeat the mistake of being greedy for small gains and losing big ones. It is too late to regret it.</p>
<p>In short, workers are greedy and lazy and unwilling to serve wholeheartedly, and industrialists are greedy for profit and have no time to take into account safety issues. As a result, both labor and capital are harmed. Therefore, in order to prevent such disasters, the local government should have the determination—not just a piece of official document to settle the case—to supervise the capital side and not allow them to make do with things. The capital side should have sufficient industrial knowledge to supervise the workers and not allow them to be perfunctory. In this way, industry can have the hope of progress, and human safety can also have a considerable guarantee. I don't know if my proposition can be permitted by the facts and be unimpeded?</p>
<h3 id="e271">Saving the Country Through Aviation <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>In China, which is facing a national crisis these days, the most fashionable slogan is no more than saving the country through aviation. There is a lot of talk about airplanes, and you come up with an XX model, and I come up with an XX model. In the near future, China will definitely have a lot more airplanes!</p>
<p>While China is making a big fuss about saving the country through aviation, Japan is also calling for expanding its air force, actively buying airplanes and training aviation talents. Because according to the Japanese themselves, the airplanes that Japan currently has are not enough to defend themselves!</p>
<p>A Japanese person said it well. Zhang Xueliang bought 500 airplanes before the September 18th Incident, but these airplanes were usually placed in warehouses and not used. The main reason was the lack of people, no one to drive them, so when the war broke out, the airplanes in this warehouse were finally given to Japan. If Japan only buys airplanes and does not train aviation personnel, the result will definitely repeat Zhang Xueliang's mistakes.</p>
<p>While everyone is making a fuss about saving the country through aviation, not to mention Shanghai, even Songjiang is shouting about raising donations to buy the Songjiang. Songjiang is a very small place. If Songjiang County buys one Songjiang airplane, then the 60 counties in Jiangsu Province will have at least 60 airplanes. And the whole country may have one or two thousand airplanes. It is not difficult to blow up the entire territory of Japan with so many airplanes, and even if they land, they may occupy the entire territory of the three islands of Fusang!</p>
<p>However, as the Japanese say, if we have airplanes and no one to drive them, the result is just a gift to be given away! We are not opening an airplane exhibition. Even if we exhibit 10,000 airplanes, we will not scare away half an enemy. It can be seen that in the midst of advocating saving the country through aviation, the training of aviation personnel is a matter of urgent importance!</p>
<p>Moreover, flying military airplanes is absolutely different from ordinary airplanes. Just being able to fly is still not enough. At least you must be familiar with the methods of air warfare and the skills of dropping bombs in order to defend the country and defend against the enemy. An aviation person, when facing enemy airplanes in the air, must not be frightened.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, even if they are completely surrounded by enemy airplanes, they can only fight bravely. Everything must be practiced and trained daily, otherwise there will be no effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the people in various places, while shouting [saving the country through aviation], must also pay attention to the training of the air force.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Even Sages Make Mistakes <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Liyu</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a young man with a secondary school education, facing a dead end in terms of family finances and career prospects. Currently, I work as a low-level employee in a semi-Chinese, semi-Western store that sells German goods; it's been a few years now. My daily working hours are from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM, which is almost thirteen hours every day. Furthermore, I am not allowed to take leave normally; otherwise, my salary will be deducted on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The manager of this store is most fond of those who flatter and fawn, but I have taken a different path and refuse to comply. Therefore, although my work is no less demanding than others, the treatment I receive is not equal. Currently, I only earn a few dollars a month, barely enough for my shoes and socks. Expenses such as travel and medical care are completely out of reach. In addition, he is particularly strict with me in everything. If there is even the slightest mistake, he will fully display the ugly face of a capitalist, saying things like, "There are countless people with your skills in Shanghai, and with rice prices so high, if you make any more mistakes, get out immediately!" I think even sages make mistakes; shouldn't a low-level employee be allowed to make mistakes sometimes? But I dare not speak these words aloud, so I can only swallow my tears. If I were to argue, I would have to pack my bags and prepare to leave.</p>
<p>The calendar on the wall is flying away like snowflakes, and my age is inevitably increasing year by year, and the burden on my family is also increasing day by day. But the oppressor continues to oppress, and the oppressed will never find light. If this continues, what will be the outcome? (To be continued)</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>Shao Liyu</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading Mr. Shao's letter, we understand that although the store he works in is semi-Chinese and semi-Western, it may not be perfect, but it is much better than completely old-fashioned stores like cigarette paper shops and tea shops. The first paragraph mentions working thirteen hours a day, which is certainly very tiring, but if you think about it, how many stores in Shanghai don't open their doors at 8:00 AM and stay open until late at night? As for their employees, how many of them work in shifts? Thinking about this, I think Mr. Shao might feel more at peace. As for deducting salary for taking leave, I think it's only used to deal with people who take too much leave. Taking twenty days of leave a year would certainly not result in a salary deduction. This is the common practice we know of; Mr. Shao's store should not be an exception.</p>
<p>As for flattering and fawning, it is certainly shameful, and a man of integrity should not do it. At the same time, those who receive flattery and fawning, while they may feel pleased at the time, should also be careful not to consume honey-coated arsenic. We know that if a person has no expectations, who would bow their head and submit to fawn over you? We greatly admire Mr. Shao's ability to stand alone and maintain his integrity. But one thing we believe is that reasonable courtesy towards superiors should not be considered flattery.</p>
<p>"Even sages make mistakes" is a saying worth considering. When a person gains a higher position, they should think this way and forgive their subordinates when they occasionally make mistakes. They should not excessively reprimand them, but use a gentle tone to guide them, hoping that the same unfortunate event will not happen again. However, a person should not use this saying to excuse their own mistakes, because it can make you feel comfortable about your mistakes and not think about improving.</p>
<p>Mr. Shao: We hope you don't compare yourself to those who are better off, but rather compare yourself to those who are worse off. Although you don't need to flatter and fawn over your manager, you must show reasonable courtesy. Strive to be responsible in your work and don't give up on yourself.

<p>— Written by E.P. Falkowski, Abridged and Translated by Zhixiang (Part 4)</p>
<p>The lights on the main street flowed like the Milky Way in the center of the city. On Saturdays, the workers who toiled for six days in the dark underground felt very happy. Every store was filled with endless hope: "Take me home!" A dress hanging on a mannequin seemed to say.</p>
<p>During this economic downturn, stores eagerly hoped that workers would spend their hard-earned cash on them. Although the alleys were darker than the main street, such jokes were not uncommon, because the alleys were familiar with poverty and could understand it. This silent darkness was illuminated by the ghostly and eerie light of the street lamps. Peter turned into Qilan Street, passed the temporary construction of the Temperance Society, which was originally wasteland, and the great Irish Church. As he walked further, the street gradually became uneven and impoverished, and the plaster on the walls of the houses was largely peeling off. These houses creaked in the cold wind, echoing the sound of mining underground.</p>
<p>At the end of the street, where a round stone pillar stood suddenly like the remains of a huge ancient beast, was the last house. The tilted house displayed a terrifying sight. The sound of a heavily struck piano poured out from the crack in the door. A tattered sign was nailed to the rectangular window: [ ] Butuoer. Peter pushed the door open and walked in. The tavern was filled with noise. Diners sat in a straight line, drinking, smoking, talking loudly, and arguing. John Lewis! The leader of the coal miners' union! His rights and wrongs were the subject of conversation for a group of workers sitting on coal dust in the corner of the room. An old man with bulging veins was retelling the heroic stories of the 1902 strike. Some complained about their meager wages. The old miners were fearful because their work was gradually decreasing. After six days of silent work and sweating in distress, they could now vent freely. But Peter was as silent as he was at home, and found a seat to sit down. John Goodpille—give him a drink. John Goodpille! He was very famous among the coal miners, not only because he was fond of Zhu! He often said that unless he treated his fellow workers well, he would not get anything! But he was a humanitarian. He trusted those workers, gave them wine, and lent them money. He used to be a miner, but now he had savings in the bank, which could be seen from his outward extravagance. His shining head was like a slider. He had a car, and one of his sons was studying at university, hoping to become a lawyer in the future, and another hoped to become a pastor. John Goodpille's life was gradually becoming noble. He could also occupy a position among the successful people in America.</p>
<p>Peter's fingers picked up the glass of wine and felt the aroma of the wine. Around him, many people were arguing fiercely: "John Lewis is a bad guy! Didn't he sell us out in the last contract he signed?"</p>
<p>"Do you think a foreman can have a salary of thousands of dollars a month? There will be an accident soon, right? Do you believe it?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" said a person sitting behind Peter. "Poor Mike Rhodes was crushed to death by a falling rock in the mine today. His wife and three children are really pitiful! He was a good man! Who could have predicted he would have such an encounter! A few days ago, I was still drinking with him!"</p>
<p>"No one can ever predict what will happen today or tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"Peter, old friend, how are you! How is business?" came from the smoke-filled seat on the other side.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Tala Birell Narrowly Escapes Assault <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Ansen</p>
<p>Difficulties with the American Immigration Authorities</p>
<p>Tala Birell, an Austrian actress with the Universal Film Company in Hollywood, and her sister, Gabriella Birell, are a pair of unique sisters in Hollywood. The two sisters are very affectionate and almost always together, always going out together. The people of Hollywood also care for these two understanding flowers. Unexpectedly, they recently drove out for a tour and accidentally entered Mexico. On their way back, they were harassed by the American immigration authorities and were unable to return or advance, putting them in a very dangerous situation. Therefore, Hollywood's public opinion is unanimously dissatisfied with the immigration bureau's perfunctory handling of affairs. Here is a detailed account:</p>
<p>Tala Birell is fond of traveling. One day, she and her sister Gabriella drove a car south and arrived at San Diego, the southernmost city in California. This place is very close to the Mexican border, and there is a fun place in Mexico called Agua Caliente, where you can swim and gamble, like Monte Carlo in France. Tala suddenly thought of this place, and since it was only seventeen miles away, she couldn't miss it. So the two sisters decided to drive their car to Agua Caliente.</p>
<p>They drove for thirty minutes and arrived at the US-Mexico border. The guards of the US border immigration bureau did not check them, but simply waved their hands and said, "Go ahead." After another hundred steps, that was Mexican territory. The Mexican police also did not cause any trouble, but simply asked the usual question, "Do you have anything to declare?" They answered, "No," and passed safely. They passed through a place called Tijuana and reached their destination. They had breakfast in Agua Caliente, played for half a day, and around 2:00 PM, they took the car and returned along the same route.</p>
<p>On the way, the two of them discussed the beautiful scenery of Agua Caliente and unconsciously returned to the US-Mexico border line. This time, the Mexican police gave them a farewell gift. They waved their hands and they passed. But the US border has always been easy to cross in and difficult to cross out. This time, there were four armed police officers in front of the US immigration bureau who stopped their car. "Hey, what country are you from?" one of the officers asked. Tala replied that they were Austrian.</p>
<p>"Where are your passports?" another shouted loudly.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Tala had organized all her passports and documents two weeks ago and brought them with her in the car. So she immediately found the passports and handed them to the grim-faced police officer for inspection. They immediately gathered around and carefully examined the passports. Later, one person said, "No, this passport does not have the signature of the American consul in Mexico. You must return to Ensenada and have the American consul sign it before you can come back." "Where is Ensenada?" Tala asked, already panicking.</p>
<p>"Ensenada is on the coast of Mexico, 85 miles from here. If you want to come back today, you must drive fast and return quickly. This place will not allow crossing after 6:00 PM." Tala pleaded with them, saying that these passports were used when they came from Europe and that they did not come from Mexico. They only went to Mexico for fun. But the police officers did not let up at all, so the two sisters had no choice but to retreat into Mexico and go to Ensenada. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e275">Impressions After Watching "Orphans of the Sinful Sea" <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Qingzhu</p>
<p>Before the system of private property is broken, people in society are constantly disturbed by the issue of inheritance. Some people, because they have inherited the legacy of their ancestors, indulge in taverns and singing halls, developing habits of extravagance and licentiousness, knowing only consumption and not production, creating a class of high-level idlers, which weakens the country and society. Others, because of the unequal distribution of inheritance, cause brothers and sisters within a good family to break down emotionally, fighting among themselves, and going to court to stage all kinds of ugly dramas. We can see these evil phenomena in the newspapers every day. Tianyi Company's "Orphans of the Sinful Sea" aims at depicting the poison of the inheritance system and clearly points out the way out for the wealthy who possess huge assets: they should not harm their descendants with huge inheritances, but should use their wealth to engage in activities that benefit society and establish education for the happiness of the masses. Therefore, the film's intention is so meaningful!</p>
<p>We greatly praise the director's skillful handling of the film. The segmentation of scenes is very appropriate, and the camera angles are also flexible.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of actors, especially the child star Shao Suxia, she is indeed a lovely girl. Her lively posture, graceful figure, and acting ability have been well received by the audience in silent films in the past, but this film further demonstrates her acting ability, so her future is promising. Even Ma Loufen's expressions in this film are more advanced than in "Two Orphans in the Battlefield." Hu Shan's villainous role is also passable.</p>
<p>Regarding the scenery: the living room and garden are realistically arranged, and the Tang Dynasty palace is magnificent, tortuous, and exquisite, which can be called a great masterpiece.</p>
<p>Another point is that this film has no subtitles at all, which also opens a new era for domestic films.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Orphans of the Sinful Sea <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>From the advertisements in the New Light, we know that Tianyi Company's new sound film "Orphans of the Sinful Sea"—also known as "A Millionaire on the Sea"—premiered yesterday. All those who support domestic films are hoping to know its success, right?</p>
<p>Story</p>
<p>A wealthy man in Shanghai lost his daughter when she was young. He only had a niece left by his deceased younger brother. He planned to adopt her, but she was in love with a young man outside and was living with him. They hired a maid. Coincidentally, the maid's fake father inquired about everything and learned that the maid was the wealthy man's biological daughter. When the wealthy man's brother was alive, in order to seize his brother's property, he stole the daughter and threw her into the river, only to be picked up by him. So he ran to the wealthy man's niece's small house to extort 10,000 yuan, leaving the little maid behind and fleeing to Tianjin. The niece and her lover, knowing that the maid was the wealthy man's flesh and blood, feared that it would be detrimental to them, so they wanted to kill her to silence her. They were forcing her to take poison, but they were reported, and the pair of lovebirds and the "maid's fake father" who fled to Tianjin were arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Zuiweng did well in general, but he neglected many details. The use of dark writing and phantoms was counterproductive. At the end, the wealthy man's young daughter also entered a civilian school, but she was dressed in fancy clothes, not only had she not shed her class consciousness, but it was also unnecessarily elaborate. However, the interspersed close-ups were extremely satisfying.</p>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>Hu Shanshan is beautiful and elegant, playing a pampered and licentious girl. Her expressions and lines are good, scolding those who worship modern figures, but not as profound as in "Two Orphans in the Battlefield." Ma Loufen is very ordinary. Shao Suxia's performance is small, but her results are excellent. Lu Lixia's great talent is a flash in the pan. Only one segment is interspersed. Zhang Zhenduo is mature and skilled, very good. Wu Yixiao, Qi Zhengmin, and Cang Yinqiu in the supporting roles have amazing achievements and are indeed commendable. Famous actors like Ma Zhengzhong did not appear at all, only a distant shadow flashed by, but his name was listed fourth on the cast list, for some unknown reason. The dialogue and text are very good, but sometimes they seem too few and cannot express the meaning fully, which is open to discussion. The photography is ordinary, and the editing is only competent. The lighting is not very clear. I hope the Tianyi authorities will pay attention to it in the future. It has hindered the photography from being brilliant. The sound is very clear. In some places, it does not match the movements on the screen, which is a pity. The scenery is purely Europeanized, which does not need to be evaluated. The capital has been spent a lot, which is enough to be called great.</p>
<p>Overall</p>
<p>On average, the whole film can be regarded as a work above the water level, because it is a domestic sound film, so it is worth watching.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Mary Pickford's Many Mishaps <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Shichun</p>
<p>Not long ago! When Mary Pickford was filming her new film "Secrets," a large lamp suddenly fell, causing a serious shoulder injury. Later, when Mary recovered from her injury and was about to start work, the male lead Wilton Hepburn suddenly resigned, delaying the filming for a few more days. Mary had to find a new male lead and sought the opinions of Cher Ferrell, Luo Lei Cooper, Li Qiudix, Fredrich March, and John McBrown, but to no avail. Finally, she found a famous British actor, Leslie Howard, to play the lead. Just as she was about to start filming, Mary's brother suddenly fell critically ill in Paris, making her distraught and unable to work. Later, her brother called to say that there was a slight improvement, and she continued filming "Secrets." Unexpectedly, after a few days, she received the news of her brother's death, and she stopped working to prepare for her brother's funeral. Mary's "Secrets" has been filmed for the fourth time. The first and second times were abandoned because Mary herself was not satisfied. The third time was delayed due to injury, and the male lead Wilton Hepburn resigned, resulting in it being abandoned halfway. The fourth time it was shelved again because her brother died. It is unknown when the film "Secrets" will be completed. Mary's losses in "Secrets" must be considerable.</p>
<p>"War Comes to Anne" is a masterpiece by Helen Hayes and Gary Cooper, woven into an immortal war love film by the great director Bao Ruoqi of "Seventh Heaven" using scientific techniques.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Various Rumors About Jeanette MacDonald <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Shenqi</p>
<p>A few years ago, Hollywood rumored that MacDonald and her fiancé Bob Richey were married, but MacDonald absolutely denied it. Now that MacDonald has gone to Paris, Hollywood is rumored that MacDonald will marry Shiva Lei in Shiva Lei's hometown. However, some people say that MacDonald will marry Bob Richey in Paris and have personally seen Shiva Lei unhappy in Hollywood, which shows that MacDonald will never marry him.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Soviet Film Depicts Turkish War of Independence <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>TASS Moscow, 28th. The Soviet film Toras represents Chai Xi, a famous Soviet playwright. Chai recently returned from visiting Turkey, collecting a lot of materials, and plans to write a film and drama based on the Turkish War of Independence. Chai told Soviet reporters that he stayed in Turkey for six weeks and talked with the famous Turkish writer Nuri, learning about the Turkish War from 1918 to 1922, the current economic situation and life of the Turkish people. He talked with people who participated in the battle and was provided with literary materials by several writers. Chai said, "The new film will depict the Turkish war against imperialism." For those in the Soviet Union, this play is not a chronicle, nor a narrative poem, but a completely psychological drama. The plot is the story of a Turkish youth in the 20th century participating in the battle. Actors from both countries are used, and the explanatory text is also the same. It is also planned to add French explanation. Chai also said that when he traveled to Turkey, he was treated well by the people there. This film will further enhance the friendship between the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Rereading the Old Story of "Dragon and Tiger Fight" <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>It seems inappropriate to review "Dragon and Tiger Fight" now, but because this film has not been reviewed by various film publications except for one introduction when it premiered in Nanjing, I think it is quite necessary to reread the old story.</p>
<p>Film certainly bears the important mission of art, but at the same time, it also bears a very important responsibility in education. Once we recognize this point, and then review this film, then we can get a more accurate review.</p>
<p>Indeed, this film has no plot and is a disjointed collection of hunting scenes, but it unfolds the great nature of the universe, the survival competition between creatures, and the revelation of beasts killing each other and people benefiting, so it has achieved the mission of film in art and education. It also gives us a kind of hint! A profound hint!</p>
<p>The director of "Dragon and Tiger Fight" can also be said to have achieved considerable success. He can not only skillfully arrange various thrilling battles, but also appropriately insert local customs and many light and humorous fragments. In this case, it can also be said that the director is showing off his cleverness.</p>
<p>In terms of photography, I can assert that it is great and skillful. From various angles, it allows us to clearly see the mutual struggle of various wild animals.</p>

<p>— Shi</p>
<p>The Queen had never been so beautiful. She wore a gorgeous palace dress with jewels and stood by the Emperor. She was very proud. Her eyes were sparkling, and her faint smile was easily seen on her slightly parted lips. Seeing her, Paul felt sorrow occupy his heart again. He wished he had the ability to make his master happy all the time! But now, this terrible news was about to come to her. Which of the Russian nobles could be completely sure of what their future held?</p>
<p>The Queen was chatting with Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, her jade-white arms embracing the Crown Prince who stood by her side. The Archduke of Austria represented the Austrian King and presented a gift to the Crown Prince. The little Crown Prince stood solemnly and saluted, asking the Archduke to thank His Majesty the King of Austria. As the Austrian Archduke stepped back, the French Ambassador immediately appeared before them, "Your Majesty! I would like to express the condolences of the Great French Republic for your country's tragic loss. The Archduke was a good friend of our country, and his assassination is deeply lamented by our country."</p>
<p>"Assassinated?" The Queen looked at the Emperor quickly and eagerly. She feared that she, her husband, the one she loved, might be the next one to be assassinated!</p>
<p>"When?" The word jumped out from between the Emperor's firm teeth. He was extremely shocked at this moment, but even in this mood, he did not forget his wife. His hand reached out protectively to touch her.</p>
<p>Paul and looked on, quickly stepping forward. The Queen saw him and said weakly, "Paul, he said Suo Gai...Suo..."</p>
<p>Gai..." Her lips closed in a slight smile. She could not say any more.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty," Paul whispered softly.</p>
<p>"I saw Paul earlier this morning," she said sadly, like a child, "We were watching the new troops of the Imperial Guard...we were still laughing...but now when we see him, we..."</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, I should have reported it earlier," Paul said regretfully. "But I saw how happy you were! I couldn't bear to."</p>
<p>The French Ambassador stepped back. The Queen turned to the Emperor again, "Why did they have to kill him? He loved Russia as much as you do!" She could no longer hold back her tears, which flowed down her fair cheeks. "Now, we only have Paul to be close to."</p>
<p>"Dear!" The Emperor held her hand. "You must be strong...people will see."</p>
<p>"I know..." The Queen sadly restrained herself. People are always watching us! What have we done to make people treat us this way! We..." She cried loudly at this moment. (To be continued)</p>
