<h3 id="c21">我們在前線等你 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 震</p>
<p>最近孫殿英軍長從前線電慰關麟徵師長。電中有最悲壯的一句。是「我們在前線等你。」壯哉斯言。我們眞如聞其聲。如見其人。</p>
<p>岳武穆說得好。「文官不要錢。武官不怕死。而天下太平矣。」我國今日之所以有土不能守。有侮不能禦。以土廣民衆的龐大民族呀而竟宛轉俎上。任人宰割。雖其因不一。但「文官要錢武官怕死。」實爲最重要的一端。人民出其血汗以養兵。額逾二百萬。然而以如此鉅大的軍額。徒爲對内戰爭的工具。對我民族當前的大敵。則安坐觀望。或竟導敵深入。這樣的不盡責的軍人。聽了孫軍長在前線高喊「我們在前綫等你」的悲壯呼聲。能不怦然動中。慚愧的無地自容嗎。　　一二八上海之戰。全國人民對於抗日將士。無不踴躍捐輸。熱烈愛護。這次對於口外前綫將士。也是同樣的欽崇愛戴。所以我們認爲在當前情勢之下。軍人旣最多報國機會。尤最易博得人民的好感。一新二十年來人民對軍人厭惡的心理。假如在這樣的時機之下。全國軍人。還不能負起救國抗日的責任。那便眞是甘爲民族的罪人了。</p>
<p>我們回溯歷史。每一個國家的滅亡。無不是由於文官要錢。使政治紛如亂絲。武人怕死。使國家無自衛的武力。於外冦之來。或隔岸觀火。或各自爲戰。即就最近的歷史而言。明朝之所以滅亡。即基因於此。然而今日我國的現象。其危險正與明末無異。我們已經立在生死綫上了。假如我們不甘我民族就此淪亡。目前即爲覺悟的最後時機。亦即爲救國的最後時機。衝向前綫去。前綫已有人在向我們招手。全線已有人在向我們點頭。全國的軍人。應該奮起。拿血肉到前線去拚。全國人民。尤其應該奮起。各盡其力。爲國効命。與前線將士的精神合而爲一。才是我民族當前唯一的出路。</p>
<p>「我們在前線等你。」這聲音是悲壯的。是有力的。我們應該當作一聲衝鋒的戰鼓。應該當作一聲動員全民族的號角。答應一聲來……來。</p>

<p>紐約通訊</p>
<p>「債務」</p>
<p>在許多地方、農民所負債務利息、比稅捐更甚、現今全美農民單就地稅抵押債欵、達九十萬萬金元以上、此外其他各種債務、約計有三十萬萬金元、這樣、美國農民所負債務、共達一百二十萬萬至一百三十萬萬金元之巨、全美農户、共計有六百萬餘户、那末每家平均有兩千金元債務了、每年單單押欵利息、達六萬萬七千一百萬金元、有十分之一的農户、所負債額計達他們所有財産四分之三、五分之一的農户、計達其財産之一半、所有這些、尙係据地皮契約上的價格計算、事實上因農民破産之結果、地價跌落更甚、據胡佛委員會報告、近十年來、全美農地價格之跌落、共計達二百萬萬金元、無數農户財産、折合起來、尙不符還債之數、這些債欵三分之二以上、是握在銀行和保險公司手中、因此自然而然地發生了一個問題、誰是農地之眞正所有者、是還債無望的農户呢、還是控制他們的銀行呢、成千的無力還債的農户、其財産被銀行充公拍賣了、</p>
<p>近十幾年來、美國佃農之猛烈發展、原因亦在於此、農民將自己家産抵押之後、便做佃户、五十年前的時候、美國處女地行將被人佔盡、其時佃農、曾不過全體農户四分之一、現在幾達一半（百分之四二、）美國農民一年所納地租、約在七萬萬金元以上即比債務利息或稅捐還多、在現今農産物價格暴跌之下、美國佃農生活、其苦况難以筆述、</p>
<p>現在大部分農民收入、尙不及以前僱農工資之一半、在經濟恐慌之第一年度、即約有三分之一的農户去尋求副業、以補家用、再則、農民自由丢棄的田地、多半荒蕪、便變爲官地、這種官地、始初爲美國歷史所見、不但减少、而且日在增加、不論怎樣、事實上美國農民、漸漸已不成其爲他們自己財産的眞正所有者了、恐慌時代之資本主義、或是將農民從他們田地上騙逐出去、或是將農民變爲終身債務者丨不自由的佃農、而連僱農都不如、</p>
<p>「曳引機成了使農民貧窮化的武器」資本主義的一個特徵、就是在農民這種大批破産中、技術的進步、新式農業機之應用、有莫大的關係、美國使用曳引機和複合機、却是更有力的將農民推入於深淵之中、機器提高生産、因之更促進了物價的跌落、美國的近十年、算是該國農業技術大革命之一時代、應用於農業的曳引機達九十萬架、單由一九二二至一九二六年五年間、這使生産提高了四分之一以上、而其播種面積並未增加的、結果只是物價暴跌、小農破産了、</p>
<p>同時、生産力之增加、造成了剩餘勞動者、在美國廣大平原區域、一個工人利用新式機器、大約可以管理三百英畝的播種面積、過剩人口旣無處可容納、那末結果美國農村便是堆積了大量閑人、無事可作、只是加强了勞動市場之競爭、一九一七年時、蒙達拿州種麥農家共計有三萬五千户、現今只有一萬四千户、單單該州被機器所排擠的兩萬一千户農家、他們是到什末地方去了呢、他們是怎樣生活的呢、</p>
<p>曳引機和複合機之應用、在美國還有一個結果、就是曳引機使中等農民和貧農破産、而促進富農和大資本主義農業的迅速增長、甚至胡佛委員會亦不得不說「中級農民日見减少、」據一九三○年户口調查統計、由一九二○年一九三○年十年之間、只是中等農民土地數目减少、反之、貧小農户（十九英畝以下者）、和大農户（五百英畝以上者）俱大大增加、比如佔有田地一千至五千英畝的農户、其所有田地、曾由一萬萬零六百萬增至一萬萬兩千七百萬英畝、即增了百分之二○、而佔有田地五畝以上的農户、其所有田地曾由一萬萬一千三百萬增至一萬萬四千八百萬英畝、即約增加了三分之一、所以在資本主義恐慌的國家内、曳引機使用的結果、就是這樣的、貧小農户愈形分小、中等農户破産、富農日益增加、在純粹播種小麥區域、此情形更爲明顯、比如曳引機最盛行的西部州、千畝以上的農户田地數目、竟增加了一半多、</p>
<p>「减種運動」</p>
<p>自然、在這種悲慘局面下、農民也不能不另謀生路、抗稅抗債、以及不許銀行或政府機關拍賣農産之事、時有所聞、有的地方、農民公開糾衆殺死監督拍賣之法官檢查官和法庭職員、有的地方成千農民自行集合、以極低價錢、拍賣田地和農器、不許他人參與、一匹牛馬只賣一角或五分、這樣出賣之地或農具、仍可留原主手裏使用、</p>
<p>這種原始運動、初發生於西部各州、現在蔓延於許多州、並漸入於東部各州、事實上好多州曾形成了「非法」局面、法律及其監督者、都已失其效力、「在某種意義上丨丨Evening　Post報主筆說、丨丨這是一種眞正的反對現秩序的和平的革命、其目的是在取消苛重負担」二月三日下院開會時、紐約州代表加爾吉講演謂、不惟「和平」的革命、大有可能、並將農民行動比之美國獨立戰爭暴發時的波斯頓暴動、</p>
<p>自然美國當局、也曾設法來緩和、有的大銀行和保險公司自動宣稱、暫停止拍賣、上議院議員何爾提議全國緩付債務兩年、有的主張設法提高農産物價格、有的甚至主張用通貨膨脹政策來挽救者、這些計劃中最有名者、要算下院通過的所謂减少播種面積案、其辦法爲現在市價與戰前物價之差數、由國家設立一特種稅、來補償農民、但農民須將耕地大部分荒蕪、以期减少生産而提高物價、這是一回趣事、</p>
<p>不過美國這些計劃、或是將引起銀行界與托辣斯之反抗、或只是暫圖苟延殘喘而已、「减種」法案、已算是被埋葬了、所有這些計劃、說到好處、至多只能給貧窮不堪的農民以暫時而微弱的安慰、可怕的農業恐慌、乃資本主義發展和恐慌之産兒、只有隨着他滅亡而才能消滅、（完）</p>

<p>李氏詳談赴晋察晤閻馮經過</p>
<p>發表書面談話述開放政權事</p>
<p>國聞社云、中委李烈鈞、前離滬北上、視察戰况、並代表蔣委員長、分赴晋察、會晤閻錫山·馮玉祥·二氏、會商抗日軍事大計、於日前由平南下、主張於國難期間、開放政權、昨日下午五時五十分、李氏由京乘京滬車返滬、同來者爲其私人秘書張宓公、李氏除發表關於開放政權之當面談話外、並與記者詳談晤閻馮經過、</p>
<p>（會晤馮閻經過）　本人（李氏自稱下仿此）自奉召入京後、即與中央各同志研究挽救危亡方策、各同志均能掬誠相商、誠好現象、嗣以熱河告危、本人極爲關懷、仍决意北上、不幸途中、即聞承德失陷消息、中心如焚、益增焦慮、愧無隻兵可用、以與暴日相拼於前方、至太原晤閻百川先生數次、閻先生抗日態度、異常堅决、并謂三晋健兒十萬、必使其站在抗日的第一線、所部已全體動員、開抵察邊、有人常謂、晋省軍隊萎弱、其實不然、如最近在冷口屢挫暴日之商震部、固晋軍也、其他如傳作義·李服膺·楊愛原·諸部、均甚可靠、倘日軍西犯、必予以重大打擊、嗣由太原乘汽車至張垣·晤布衣馮煥章先生、馮先生主采、一如往昔、關於抗日、馮先生的主張、是積極的、强硬的、决不主張固守、至報章屢傳其有晋京消息、馮先生一再表示、抗日須站在前方、要與敵人眞殺眞打、蓋渠頗不願躱在後方避難也、中央對渠之　陳、尙在考慮中、現日軍亦有意侵略張垣、馮先生即將處在火線矣、</p>
<p>（開放政權建議）　本人鑒於國難日亟、若不全國人民團結、國亡實無日矣、乃建議開放政權、在保定與蔣軍委員長、已屢談及、蔣先生亦深覺過去之錯誤、故本人至京後、正式提交中政會、汪先生及各同志、均贊成此議、乃决定七月一日召開全國國民代表大會、將使中央政權、眞正操於國民、同時集中全國人才、管理中央政權、内旣團結、外侮自易禦也、</p>
<p>（關於開放政權）　李氏對開放政權事、發表書面談話云、此次中央確定開放政權之步驟、以求主義之實現、雖因時勢要求、而國民黨人實亦鮮有主張專政者、觀會議經過、與汪先生發表之談話、可以明瞭、惟欲將决議案之精神價值與誠意表示於天下、則今後進行當益周至、蔣先生所謂澈底開放者是也、返滬擬將中央抗日實際及改革政治誠意、介紹於社會、冀國人咸知眞相、及時奮起也、</p>

<p>陳濟棠代表楊德昭、偕其夫人、與汪精衛秘書李浩駒夫婦、由香港同乘胡佛總統號來滬、於昨晨八時　抵此、新聲社記者、晤之於輪次、楊表示俟在滬候晤蔣委員長後、再行入京、粤抗日軍、俟會齊閩步隊、即出發北上、兹分誌楊氏談話如次</p>
<p>候蔣會晤　楊氏謂本人原擬乘加拿大皇后輪來滬、嗣因事改乘胡佛總統輪、到滬後、擬先謁宋副院長、探詢蔣委員長到滬確期、在滬候謁蔣氏、報告一切、然後再行入京、謁見汪院長、</p>
<p>勦匪軍事　江西勦匪軍事、自蔣委員長北上抗日後、該項工作、并未停頓、仍在積極進行中、蔣委員長之意、本擬請陳伯南氏擔任、陳氏亦因粤方各事繁重、故不能負其全責、余漢謀氏亦不過擔任其工作之一部份而已、名義未定、須得謁晤蔣汪後、始可知、</p>
<p>即將出師　勦共工作、粤方將派○○團擔任、粤本可早出師、嗣因缺乏輜重隊之組織、其運輸須募夫、適值春耕、一時不易募集、因不得不向湘桂各省招募、一俟完竣、即可於一二日内動員出發、將來大約先開拔駐軍之十分之三、然後漸出至十分之八、至第十九軍長蔡廷錯、亦决出師援熱、</p>
<p>財政困難　關於勦匪經費、較爲困難、前粤方經費、多係由華僑方面捐得之欵、近因華僑商業失敗、每年减少一百餘萬之收益、輸出貿易亦復不佳、以致財政奇絀、故粤軍費祗五成、此次如勦匪軍費果眞無辦法時、亦祇有請中央予以補助、但并非要挾行爲、實出於不得已也</p>
<p>援熱抗日　至粤方出師援熱抗日、卽將動員、并無救國軍等任何名義之規定、仍用原有之獨立第四師番號、俟會齊閩方之十九路軍部隊、到達相當地點、即可出發、</p>
<p>外交一致　至西南對外交方面之主張、當然與中央一致、即所謂抗日勦共、不抗日則無外交可言、能抗日而後方始有外交可辦、此節當與汪精衛先生所言者相同、至本人在港、並未謁晤胡展堂氏、故胡氏并無函件交本人帶來、僅陳伯南氏有一函交轉達蔣委員長、然此亦常常往者、内容殊不外上述、希望抗日勦匪、將匪共肅清後、則方可以抗日、與勦共實有聯帶關係、至妥協之外交、自非吾人所敢贊成者、非特陳氏個人如此主張、即一般武裝同志亦均同此見地云、</p>

<p>中央委員何香凝女士之公子廖承志、近經本市公安局認有共産嫌疑、由文鴻恩局長特派督察員吕克勤、於三月二十八日午後、投公共租界老閘捕房、聲請協助拘提、當由捕頭加派中西探員馳往山西路五福弄九號門牌屋内、將廖承志及其餘亦有共黨嫌疑之閩人羅登賢、豫人余文化、等三名拿獲、翌晨、解由江蘇高等法院第二分院審問一過、諭均覊押、候再訊核各情、已誌本報、昨日午後、爲續審之期、何委員因念子情切、宿疾復發、病臥寓邸、不克到庭、惟其親友多於午後二時許、即相繼赴高二分院第一法庭旁聽、此外到庭旁聽之仕女、則亦如雲、致該寬敞之法庭、頓時</p>
<p>突告人滿　之患、後至者皆無插足地、何委員爲其子委任辯護之律師吳凱聲·馬常·及羅·余·兩人之辯護律師蔡曉白·亦如時出庭、二時半、刑庭長郁曄、推事趙鉦堂·周翰·檢察官張雋青·與書記官升座、先將其他上訴案數宗宣告判决、至二時五十分、始點傳本案之廖承志·羅登賢·余文化·三人、開始審理、當由法警將在待質室之余文化帶出、連同坐於庭隅之廖承志·羅登賢·納入被告欄内、裁判長先命捕房律師甘鏡先、報告在展期中調查之情形據甘律師稱第三被告廖承志之住址、仍未查明、而詰問第一被告羅登賢、據供、係由余文化之介紹、才認識廖承志、又據五福弄九號二房東稱、屋係由余文化向彼租賃、此外並無其他證據發現、吳凱聲律師即起立聲稱、關於廖承志之</p>
<p>住址問題　本律師亟須聲明、本來廖母何女士擬躬親到庭證明、但何女士因念子、致舊疾復發、今乃不能親來、惟其已具函證明其子實與彼同住一處、當廖承志被捕後、老閘捕房探員會會同法捕房探員、赴何寓查詢、何女士即告知探員、以其子係住家内、而探員尙續詢問住於何室、何女士時見人多、一時神經不寗、遂答以不知、由此誤會、致發生住址不明問題、所幸三日以來、除此一點外、捕房律師已聲明未查有他種證據、裁判長旋即宣告本案係市公安局聲請協助、而要求移提者、應請公安局代表陳述、而公安局法律顧問詹紀鳳律師遂稱、本案被告之證據與協定、至爲符合、應請庭上照准、至廖承志部份、因廖君是先烈廖仲愷先生之子、在理論上、想似不致有反動行爲、所以請庭上根據證據、依法裁定云云、繼由羅·余·兩人之辯護律師辯稱、公安局非正式法院、</p>
<p>根據協定　第六條及刑事訴訟法第十三條、均不能移提、况犯罪事實、（中）廖承志（左）羅登賢（右）余文化（國聞社攝）</p>
<p>現復未曾查明、故對移提一點表示反對云云、吳凱聲亦起爲廖承志辯護、大致謂、鈞院與内地皆係中華民國官廳、而蔣委員長·汪行政院長·于院長·宋副院長·政府諸當局皆有電來營救、似廖公子移提至内地較爲有利、但鈞院旣爲正式法院、實亦有權受理、不須移轉管轄、惟廖公子爲先烈仲愷先生之嗣、且僅此一子、自被捕後、其母何委員思念異常、致舊疾復發、昨已暈迷一次、今仍臥床忍泣、以對黨國有殊勳大人、而使其後嗣、</p>
<p>遭此牽累　能不痛心、設果有罪、亦應依據協定、確切證明、方准移提、兹已經過三日、並未查出證據、雖有三項疑點、但（一）住址問題、已經何委員來函證明、（二）有人指其爲共産黨、此種口頭空言、全無證據、絕不足採取置信、（三）身上搜出字條、無非借錢與人之借據收據、故此三點、亦可不攻自破云云、吳律師末並舉蘇俄人員來華爲例、謂蘇俄爲共産黨專政、現我已與之通好、蘇俄人民盡係共黨、設此輩來華、我國亦可罪之耶、總之共黨各國皆有、不能以係共黨即欲科罪、須共黨而有圖謀顚覆政府之行爲者、始得置之於法也、嗣由公安局吕督察員報告、</p>
<p>破案情形　謂先是在閘北共和路獲共黨王其良、王自承彼爲全國總工會秘書、並表示悔過自首、願將該黨秘密報告、據稱是日有共黨在五福弄九號開會、本案三被告皆將出席、羅登賢係總工會黨團書記、余文化係紅軍軍長張國韜之叔、而廖承志則爲全國海員總會之書記、因投捕房聲請派探同往該處、將廖等三人拘獲、廖身畔搜出字條甚多、中有一紙、書有上海反帝大同盟之縮語、旣有此種證據、應請依照歷來辦理移提案件之成例、准予移提、吕尙欲陳述理由、而各被告之律師皆以關於法律點、自有公安局代表律師陳述、要求庭上禁止吕氏發言、致與吕</p>
<p>稍起誤會　吕之態度亦轉激昻、旋由自首共黨張漢卿到庭作證、謂彼前充共黨中央政治局委員、曾與被告等同事、羅登賢曩亦充該局委員、後被派爲滿洲代表、近　總工會黨團書記、廖承志係去年五月回國、任海員總工會黨團書記、去年十一月、在閘北開會、議决許多危害民國辦法、余文化乃張國韜之叔、曾經獲罪入獄等語、質之被告羅登賢對吕督察員及張漢卿所述、均不承認、謂到滿洲係充義勇軍、並曾在日人紗廠作工、生少讀書、不知何謂反動、余文化供、我坐牢至去年七月才釋、張某適稱、彼於去年三月、與我相識、殊屬不解、庭上詢以獲何罪而入獄、彼答稱亦因政治嫌疑、末由廖、</p>
<p>承志自白　除堅决否認與張漢卿相識外、並稱彼並不以其先父及母之光榮而希冀對彼個人優待、但此、班人（指吕張）所言、决不能承認、要求無條件釋放、裁審長旋詢捕房律師對於移送有無意見、甘律師乃稱、本案爲恊助案件、以通常情形論、公安局已有兩人證明、移送當不反對、惟鈞院如認爲欲受理、則捕房亦可進行調查、但法律係平等性質、自未便以身份高下而有所軒　、應請庭上酌奪、郁庭長訊畢、因張檢察官無意見發表、遂與趙周兩推事退庭磋商片刻、仍復升座、宣告裁决、羅登賢·余文化·廖承志·移送市公安局、證物一併移送、羅·余·兩人之律師即口頭提起抗告、並聲請停止裁决執行、但卒經庭上駁回、於是廖等三人、遂由吕督察員帶往市公安局去矣、</p>

<p>本埠徐先孚君來信（一）</p>
<p>記者先生：三月二日那封課務怱忙中草草奉覆的一信，竟在十四日的貴報發表了。這封信引起先生許多問題要命我答覆，我現在分答如下。（一）這是先生十四日答話中的第（三）點高見，我在此首先奉答。所謂感慨，在心理學上的意義，感是受到Ｓtimulus的感覺，慨是Response。我第一封信（二月二十八日發表的）的感慨是經過以往積累的「感」，而發生一種强力的「慨」；所以既冗累又憤激，冒凟尊貴的篇幅。「研究」在英語是Research，是從環境或材料中搜索出所求的目的。這種工作，在感慨之後亦嘗發生。詹姆士以爲人類的「自我」，是由物質，社會，精神三部組織而成，我們對於這三部分的表現，常有滿意和不滿意的感情，而發生所謂「自覺」。這個步驟，我以爲即等於「感慨」。詹氏又說，我們在自覺上的滿意和不滿意，乃發生身體的自謀，社會的自謀，和心靈的自謀。這我以爲就是研究的工作。明乎此，則感慨與研究有别。而我第一封信的感慨，並非先存那是有關國家存亡民族興衰的觀念而發洩之，乃因發洩後而聯感到有關國家民族，所以請求發表。但，先生請勿以其爲感慨而藐視之，感慨，亦有關國家民族的。譬如，項籍見秦王之威赫，慨曰：「我可取而代之！」其後卒率八千子弟渡江。班超爲官傭書，投筆而嘆！「大丈夫無他志略，亦當效傅介子張騫立功異域，以取封侯，安能久事筆硯間乎！」於是乃通西域。宋太祖酒後慨謂石守信等曰：「一旦有以黄袍加汝身，汝雖不爲，其可得乎！」次日守信等乞罷典禁軍。於是杯酒釋兵權。釋迦牟尼目擊印度社會不平，大有所感，曰：「我不入地獄，誰人地獄。」其後影響於印度中國者如何？社會主義先驅者傅利葉在一七九九年適充一米店店員，店主命其抛朽米於海，以期米價增，傅氏卽深感此種商業資本主義之罪惡，乃起而圖改革社會，費息特憤於德受拿破崙之蹂躪，於耶拿一役後（一八零八年），用熱烈的情感，發表其告德意志人民書，此文影響於德國的命運如何？這裏應聲明，孚也不才，何敢媲美先賢，不過隨便舉數例證已耳。請先生爲我不取者，幸勿爲先賢不取！（二）這裏來討論供給力量與西洋文明。在中國，在西洋，「自然」是不分軒輊的都在侵略，此是先生也承認的。試問中國對於自然的爲難，怎樣的加以控制？一言蔽之，束手無策而已矣。如積極的國富不能開採，國土不便交通，消極的如對黄河，水災不能預防救濟。但西洋文明則否，它能制止克服自然且能利用之，以供給人們進化的智識和技術（據說德國有位工程師以人造黄河研究黄河水利，何中國反不見），此即東西洋兩文明的分野，也就是西洋文明的特長，稱之曰眞髓，誰曰不宜！那麽我的第一封信和第二封信裏的兩句話都是是的，並不一是一非。在資本主義環境，在社會主義環境，「自然」也在無分軒輊的侵略，此亦爲先生所承認。但先生以爲資本主義與社會主義在供給力量上亦有差别，原因在「征服自然是人類社會中進行的」。這句話，我看來適巧倒果爲因，因爲人類社會是在人類征服自然中進行。歷史的事實告訴我們，不必求之遠古，近代資本主義的産生，在十八世紀末葉工業革命以後，即人類控制利用自然的技術進步之後。帝國主義的世界競爭，開始自達爾文的「物競天擇」的進化論後，即人類克服自然的智識進步之後。即以現今的蘇聯而論，她的征服自然的智識和技術，何一非資本主義國家所引用的！如美國的工程師，德國的機械等。她以社會主義的社會在智識和技術上丨丨供給的力量，並不全異於資本主義的社會，不過應用智識和技術的方向不同而已。先生所種，有「有計畫地，有系統地，最經濟地，最充分地」的形容詞，這不過表示社會主義的支配的分量的方向的特色，換言之，卽如蘇聯之社會主義國家，她應用人類智識和技術是傾於」有計畫地，有系統地，最經濟地，最充分地」的方向。美國Walter　W.Lucasse博士說：「他們（純準科學者）把智識交給了社會，至於社會的把牠作爲正當或不正當的應用，那是社會應該負的全責。」那我們何妨說，資本主義的應用進化的智識和技術是不正當的，社會主義的應用進化的智識和技術是正當的，這正靠我們對於社會的控制和支配的力量如何？初無關乎供給的力量。這就是英德美之爲英德美，蘇聯之爲蘇聯。於是我所說「資本主義與社會主義的差别只在指導人類進化的方向的力量」，並不失却一半眞實的内容。（三）這裏我再奉答先先十四日答話中第（二）點。關於這點，先生在我的第一封信裏，似乎就有誤會，我敢說，先生的誤會卽在以爲我那封信的主體是民衆健康問題。其實，我感覺我國的一部分統治者和所謂領袖以及一部分青年和城市民衆，他們對於體育的狂熱和縻費的危險性及不宜性。由那些積累的刺激，在最近的較强的刺激中盡情發了出來，並且此種反感蟬聯了其他的反感，就是說，由感慨到體育不是中國的出路而聯感到中國的出路在救愚。那軍事訓練和生産勞作的救濟健康問題的提出，不過是退一步的話說，此可復查。先生旣有這個誤會，所以提出那五個問題亦都以健康問題爲解决的目的。其實，它們是他們（工農）的整個出路問題，找他們的出路，也就是找中國的出路。而中國的社會將在資本主義支配的力量之下抑在社會主義支配的力量之下亦决乎此。至於先生的第（四）點，我對於資本主義和社會主義的差别也不必多說，因爲先生自己已替我解答在上了。何况先知先覺在歷史己指明給我們、蘇聯與其他的國家在事實上已分判給我們的目前。最後，我對於上次一函的詞多於意，表示抱憾！但不知這一封信如何？</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>丨願飲四月七日酒丨　丨莫作四月一日魚丨</p>
<p>四月裏天氣，是多麽遞宜春遊的日子啊！尤其是六橋三竺間的春假旅行團，很寫意的過那登樓飲酒臨水觀魚的生活；但是，擴大着鳥瞰世界的眼光，願飲四月七日美國的酒，莫作四月一日歐洲的魚。</p>
<p>自從濕派屈服於乾派之下，美國的民衆已有十三週年不曾爽爽快快地喝那杯中之物了！幸而，羅斯福登臺以後，先弛啐酒之禁；從四月七日零時一分鐘起，一般新大陸的酒徒，人人都可以開懷歡飲了！閙了多年的開放酒禁，直到四月裏才有實現的可能；無怪總統就任的一天，大酒桶在儀仗中耀武揚威呢。遥想四月七日以後嘴裏淡出鳥來的美國酒徒，儘敎一杯一杯又一杯的澆那囇乾了十有三年的酒甕，這呌做願飲四月七日美國的酒。</p>
<p>四月一日是萬愚日，歐洲各國人都在這一天把人愚弄爲樂；英國風俗，凡在這一天被人愚弄的呌做四月的愚人。蘇格蘭風俗，喚被愚的人，呌做四月的郭公鳥，往往投人游戲信道：</p>
<p>四月朔，擊郭公鳥於他山之木。</p>
<p>接信的，常作這般的答覆：</p>
<p>郭公鳥與天鷄，同棲於一木。……我與兩同，我郭公，爾亦郭公。</p>
<p>法國風俗，在這天被愚的人，呌做四月的魚；爲什麽喚做魚呢？相傳四月裏是魚的初生時代，凡是初生小魚，往往易被人欺；所以愚人便是四月的魚。我國有「魚肉鄕民」的成語，是受欺的鄕民也可以喚做魚，但没有四月字樣，差不多做了一輩子被欺的魚！歐洲人所說受欺的魚，只在四月一日這一天偶然做一回魚，過了這一天，便不是魚了，這呌做莫作四月一日歐洲的魚。</p>
<h3 id="c157">黃禍 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>黃種人征服半個歐羅巴，至今歐洲人還把這一回事哄嚇小孩子。在下忝爲黄種中的一員，也算三生有幸，不虚此生。</p>
<p>聽說，黄種人征服半個歐羅巴那一回事，在歐洲，不只小孩子聽着害怕，就是年紀上了半百的大人大物，也是瞎子怕天坍般的日夜祈禱着上帝，不要捉掉東方睡獅鼻子裏的瞌睡蟲，否則說不定「黄禍」會吞没這整個地球的。</p>
<p>東方睡獅，自從征服半個歐羅巴之後，也總算修行積德，一直睡到現在，没有把一個白種人膏過饞吻，而且看上去不再睡上一百年，待獵人把它四馬攢蹄，札縳停當之前，是决不會呵欠哈哈，移動一步的。這種情形，也總算給白種人服了一劑安心妙藥。</p>
<p>事情是不易捉摸的。獅子儘甜甜的睡着，旁邊那條瘦黄狗，却一天天肥碩起來，而且一天一天兇猛起來了。起初還不過啃啃睡獅的爪甲，前年索性吞掉了睡獅的尾兒。近來黄狗更像着了瘋，不拘見了甚麽影兒。都得汪汪亂吠一陣。</p>
<p>白種人知道睡獅一時不會醒過來，正歡天喜地的打算擺佈它，豈知現在給瘋黄狗覇守着，不容走近那睡獅，眼看黄狗吞下了睡獅的尾兒，逐漸啃到肚腹上來了。於是猛然記起了歐洲人所說的「黄禍」，竟應在黄狗身上了。</p>
<p>黄狗，有朝一日吃完了睡獅，胃口越吃越大，老實不客氣，肚子餓時，不難一口吞下一個白種人，連骨屑也不會漏出來。到那時，「黄」眞成了「禍」，那恐怕不只用着哄嚇小孩了。在下與黄狗一字並肩黄，托福，托福，借光，借光。</p>

<p>— 鄭楚堯</p>
<p>一寫着那個耐人尋味的「乳」字，立刻會想到那白嫩的胸部，左右隆起的那兩個圓渾得像白玉般的半球，神秘的半球頂點，點綴了粒紫紅的蓮子，活像兩朶含苞未放醉人的鮮花，坐在張舒適的沙發中，温暖的陽光烘得人懶懶欲眠，合起了眼睛，想到這，人便會像喝醉了酒般的愉快！</p>
<p>在我的故鄕杭州，女人乳的貴賤是可以分做三個時期：妙齡女郎的乳是金子鑄成的，因爲它是隠藏在小馬甲裏的，像金子般的貴重，是不輕易給人家欣賞的，青春少婦的乳，它似乎不像金子那般貴重了？據說它是銀子打成的，因爲它是不能像少女那般永遠屬爲己有；少婦的乳，一半的時間它是屬於伊親愛的夫婿的。但，雖這樣說，可是它是除出夫婿以外，這尤物，是不會現露出來的，不過，它已没有像金子那般貴重了！祇有已經産生過小孩的女子，在故鄕是稱它呌「狗奶奶」的，因爲它已没有像少女少婦所有的那般神秘了！在何論那一個人的跟前，伊都會毫不含羞地抽出自己以前被稱金子銀子的乳來，給伊的孩子當食料，它已像狗乳般的屬於大衆了！它已像石膏模型的能給大衆欣賞了！它已消失了使人痴迷得使人不可思議的魔力了。</p>

<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>在心頭挾滿了凄凉悲愴的春宵，我戰不過小樓寂漠的侵襲，於是離了寓居踽踽的走向維納絲咖啡座去，踏進了麗虹鐙的小門，就聽見一陣悽緊的音樂，我在音樂節奏悽緊中衝了進去。</p>
<p>緑色淡炧的燈光，藴育了人世的悲歡，這裏有無窮的歡笑，有沈埋的悲哀，有異國的情調，我在鐙光黯淡的一角，喊了一瓶上海啤酒，默然無語的坐着，這樣好像離開了刦難的故國，看見許多異邦的兒女在狂舞，在歡歌，在低訴柔情，如蜜談衷曲，但我没有一個認識的人，孤獨的坐着在喝苦澀的啤酒啊，這還是我大好中華的疆土啊！</p>
<p>這個舞榭的頂上四角，掛着四盞百孔的琉璃，發出五色的光芒在旋轉，從孔中散射出零亂的光線，像鬼眼，像神鐙，使你目迷神炫的成了色盲者。</p>
<p>我展眼望開去，有盎格魯撒遜民族，有斯拉夫民族，有大和民族，也有我這樣一個挾有悲愁的大中華的漢族，這裏好像一個國際的咖啡座。</p>
<p>有許多水手醉態猖蹶在摟着纖腰歡舞，薄薄春衫半裸露富有肉感的異族舞女們粉白脂紅向座客送盡了媚眼嬌笑。啊金錢壓迫了女性，出賣了青春與靈魂。在社會上賣淫女性的添增，也就是社會日漸滅落的維霰之先集吧。</p>
<p>音樂臺上吹過了一個曲調又換了一個狂歡的人們跳過華爾兹又勃魯絲，花開死，探戈舞，好像世界祗有這樣一個晚上，明朝人們就要勞燕東西，飄泊征途，充滿着享樂吧，我們盡情這樣一個短短的春宵，歡娛吧，旅途上萍蹤偶聚的人們！使我聽了深湛的哀悲滋味隨了苦酒喝向心頭。</p>
<p>夜已深深，殘夜歡歌酣舞中已經遺忘了夜的消逝，我看錶已經明朝的三點半鐘，一瓶啤酒，也不知不覺的已告罄，於是我在一般男女歡娛中就將頭裏在春大衣領中離開了維納絲，馬路上春風温暖，我依舊在靜寂街頭踽踽歸寓，祇有街鐙照着影兒在光滑的柏油路上。</p>

<p>第三回　終負解鈴心登門　錯　暗憐丫角顧推食分羹</p>
<p>這樣想着，立刻跑回屋子裏去，在坑上一坐，板了臉道；咱們也不是下賤人家，爲什麽這樣讓人家看不起呢？江氏道：唉！你不必再提到這一件事了，人家來和咱們陪不是了，也就得啦，你還說什麽呢？桂枝本想把剛才聽來的話，告訴母親的。可是轉念一想，自己跟了積之後面走出去，這一點也欠高明，不如不告訴母親爲妙，因之默然無言的低頭坐在坑上。到了次日清晨，甘家的聽差，却送了兩塊錢來，說是以前作衣服的工錢，現在都算清了，據二爺說，這兩塊錢，只有富餘的，不會短少。桂枝聽了這話，這又是一種斷絕來往的表示，心想，從來和二爺作衣服，不曾計較工錢多少，二爺說出這種話來，他也未免小視我了。他心裏如此想着，江氏也同有此想，早逃到外面屋子來道；我們費一分力氣換人家一分錢，像你們老爺二爺那樣有錢的人，當然也不會讓我們苦人吃虧，可是我們規規矩矩的和人家作話，也不願得人家分外的錢。我是個寡婦，我孩子是個大姑娘，爲什麽要人家分外的錢呢？這話好說也不好聽！江氏說了這一大套話，可把臉色板住了。那聽差道您這是對我發脾氣嗎？這些話不但不是我說的，也不是我們二爺說的，您說這話，可是錯怪了人。他說畢，轉身就走了。這位聽差一來，算是把桂枝的脾氣，又激起了不少，自己暗地裏下了决心，無論如何，以後不和甘家來往了。他自這一天起，就不到甘家去，只是陪着母親在家裏作活。在第三天上午，因爲挑水夫有事不曾來，家裏等着要水喝，桂枝就拿了一隻白鐡桶，在井邊提了一桶水向向裏走。往日在家裏搬移一半桶水，並不覺得怎樣吃力，所以自己毫不猶豫的，在井邊提一桶水回來。這井到家門口，約莫有半里之遥，還走不到三分之一的路，已經在路上歇了好幾回。（二九）</p>
<h3 id="c161">上海夜話吃烟店 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 張若吞</p>
<p>近日在工作之暇，除了啜飲咖啡以外，又多了吃紙烟的新嗜好。</p>
<p>從前我曾經立過一個志願，不吃烟則已，若使吃烟，一定要吃「吉士牌」。因爲街頭大幅「吉士」牌的美麗廣告，那種美國現代浪漫色彩濃厚的圖畫，尤其是在紅緑電光下看起來，畫得實然太煞魅誘人了。而且，「有女懷春，吉士誘之」這樣香艶綺麗的詩句，是多麽可以引動人吓！</p>
<p>自從我開始學習吃烟以來，我已經吃過不少古怪牌子的紙烟。我的買烟標準，愛好選擇有趣味的牌子名字：平日最喜歡的是「嬌媚親王」（俗稱太子），其次是「黑貓」，若使買不到「五月之花」，便買國貨紙烟「璇宫」和「天仙」。「紅唇」果然香艶得很，可惜市上很少流行。</p>
<p>震飛路金神父路附近有一家把「吃烟店」當作字號的紙烟店，是我時常光顧的地方，他們陳列着各式各樣古怪牌子的紙烟樣品，都爲市上罕見者。單是俄羅斯烟，差不多有十多種，有蘇俄出品的「高加索」，有白俄製造的裝着紙管的半截紙烟；「吉士美」「亞愛雪絲」「亞達」「亞萊葛羅」Kismet　Isis　AdaAliegro等等。</p>
<p>在邁爾西愛紅衣主敎路口，契丹大戲院對面，有一家日本人經營的雜貨店，他們獨家經理一種法國出品的「國民」牌三色烟，香味濃烈，有雪茄的香氣，吃了喉嚨並不發燥，九一八事件後，我久已裏足不去了。</p>
<p>裝璜最考究的烟匣，有銀色硬鐡盒的「我的公主」，有和合紙盒裝着二十枝的「摩那斯」，最摩登化的有英國出品的du　Maurier，分十枝裝二十枝裝兩種，烟頭是用一種經過衛生化騐的皺紙做成的，像是棉花頭，比普通的橡皮頭來得好，代價很貴，每一枝烟合市價銅元十二枚。</p>
<p>若使有人喜歡收藏顔色電影明星畫片，我勸他吃那又粗又肥的「司令」牌；若使喜歡收藏五彩西洋名畫，我勸他吃「天仙」牌。</p>
<p>紙烟烟草的原名，在英文我們都知道是呌做Tobacco，中文中最好的譯名，是「淡巴菇」。法文爲Tobaco，西班牙語爲Tabago。</p>
<p>最初發現烟草的特産地，據傳說是在英國羣島之一的Tabasco，也有人說是在墨西哥海灣的Tobacco地方，烟草的名稱，即由此二地名轉訛而來，</p>
<p>烟草初次輸入歐洲，是由西班牙商人運去的，在法國成爲一種日常嗜好品，第一個提倡的，是加德麗納欽命駐法大使若望尼古。</p>
<p>烟草的譯名，除了「淡巴菇」之外還有許多很有意味的别名，據我個人所知道的，有「擔不歸」「南蠻草」「南靈草」「多波古」「溪巴姑」「淡婆姑」「相思草」等等。</p>
<p>現代文學作品中，以紙烟爲題材的，有日本横光利一的「點了火的紙烟」，一名「紙烟蒐集家的奇禍」，（載郭建英先生譯的横光利一集「新郎的感想」中。）</p>
<p>下面是從那篇小說中節録出來的一小段：</p>
<p>「我現在自暴自棄地吸着紙烟，因爲要證明這個東西到底是否魔術。誰想得到從這烟霧迷離之中會跳出愛情來呢。這確是個魔術啊。否則，一定是紙烟的害處了。我現在發誓今後永遠不吸烟了。…唔，紙烟這個東西確是有害，還是點了火來燒它一下子吧。……在他的頭腦中點了火的無數的紙烟排起隊列，好像樂譜般向伊開始遊泳過去。丨Dames-Opera-High　Life-DaCapo-La　Came-La-Rubia……」</p>

<h3 id="c162">口外全線平靜無事 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>自從熱河在「意料中」陷落以後，我們便早已料定「抗日喜劇，」至此已經演到了「尾聲。」雖說抵抗之聲仍是不絕於耳，而請纓之電，也仍是慷慨激昻，甚至還有人在高喊「統一軍令，」「統制經濟，」像煞有介事的表示拚命的「决心，」但大家究已明白，這只是一幕「壓臺戲，」一齣滑稽的雙簧。果然在目前「航空救國」震天價響的呼聲中，口外全線，即趁機悄然地宣告「平靜無事。」　　全線平靜以後又怎樣呢？依據過去九一八滬戰的經騐，大概不外乎「圓棹會議」或什麽「協定」之類罷。然而事情也究竟還免不了有些波折，一則我們的「當局」固已一再聲明「直接交涉」之說是「無稽之謠，」另一方面據駐華日使有吉的意見：「現在日本旣已退出國聯，如果中日直接交涉，是無形中提高了中國的國際地位。」語氣中也顯然有「不屑」和我直接交涉之意。旣不「戰，」又不能「和，」那末，以後的戲該怎樣排演呢？當然，最適當的法子只有「拖，」拖個一年半載，等「國人諒解」（借用有吉的話）後再說。</p>
<p>口外全線已經平靜無事了，雖說東北半壁河山已經變易了顔色，但日人能「適可而止」「不爲已甚，」究竟是可喜的事；而且，據××先生說：「不出今年年底，東北失地，决可恢復，」所以，這並用不着担心。却是目前最令我們放心不下的，我以爲還是有吉的那一派胡言。他說：「各省軍事領袖，現雖因對外緊張，而暫告中止内戰，但暗潮仍日在澎漲，不過均格於中國人民之評議而不敢自爲戎首耳。」當然，在兩年來我們的軍政當局「精誠團結一致禦侮」的昭示下，有吉的話，我們决不應信其遂爲事實，但「精誠團結」是爲了「一致禦侮，」到了無侮可禦的時候，又誰能担保我們的將爺們不深感「髀肉復生」而演出另一齣喜劇來呢？</p>
<p>「抗日」喜劇已經快要結束了，但觀衆們，請等着，「拿手好戲」還在後頭呵！</p>
<h3 id="c163">擺渡夫 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 裘鵬</p>
<p>我第一次遇見他，是在兩年前的一個黄昏。</p>
<p>那也正是這樣的初春天氣，我和幾個朋友經過這渡頭。當我們跨進渡船，我第一眼瞧到的就是這擺渡夫。那樣一個乾枯的老頭兒，鬚髮稀稀的，弓着背，不住的咳嗽，瞧他那衰老的情形，直使你不信他還能那樣輕便靈活的搖櫓：</p>
<p>「擺渡的！吃這碗飯長遠了嗎？」</p>
<p>「長遠啦。幾代的祖傳，從小就幹這活兒。」</p>
<p>「每天的出息怎樣？」</p>
<p>「還算好。只要每天能擺三十次，每次渡五個人，那麽每人銅元兩枚，也就有三千文進益，儘夠一家的吃用了！」</p>
<p>對於生活的滿足的微笑展開在他那枯皺的臉孔上；他邊搖櫓，邊唱起：「四月麥田會情郎……」的山歌，把我們搖到了對岸。</p>
<p>以後我不時打這渡頭經過，這擺渡夫的樂天的笑容和歌聲，漸漸的在我的腦子裏留下了一個親切的印象！</p>
<p>但到去年秋天，又經過那渡頭，我忽然瞧見他臉上消失了那常有的歡容。我隨意的問：</p>
<p>「擺渡的，不唱山歌了嗎？」</p>
<p>「還有心情唱山歌：眼見得就要没飯吃呢！」</p>
<p>「什麽事？」</p>
<p>「告訴你先生：這也只怪我窮人多了嘴！瞎着眼惹了有錢人就得斷送自家的命！就爲前幾天××園裏三老爺打這裏經過，他一下船，就儘催着我快搖快搖，直想一櫓就搖到對岸。我認不得他，給催起了火，就說：「你先生莫太性急了！渡船總得這麽一櫓櫓的搖；你先生要快的話，最好自家去造條橋！」天！就這麽一句話惹了禍呢！那個三老爺馬上回去招工造橋。你說有錢人什麽事幹不了！瞧，現在不是已經有人在這裏替他測量了麽？只等橋造好，我們這碗飯也就完啦！」</p>
<p>我順着他的手指看去，果見有幾個人在兩岸搭架測量呢！</p>
<p>「但你當初爲什麽不去向他們求饒呢？」</p>
<p>「還用得你先生說！我一得了這消息馬上全家趕去跪在三老爺跟前，叩響頭求饒。可是有什麽用呢？那個人已經氣狠了，他說：「咱三老爺活了一輩子没有受過别人的氣，今兒却來嘔你這擺渡夫的鳥氣！非敎你這混蛋打破你那狗食盆不行……」……我年紀老了，每天像這麽短距離搖搖歇歇還來得，要我改行幹别的事却吃不消……你說一家子的命，這回不是完了嗎？」</p>
<p>悲慘的聲音使我没有勇氣回頭瞧他的臉。我匆匆的登上岸走了。</p>
<p>………………………………</p>
<p>橋終於落成了，當我第一次跨上那偉大的石橋時，我就想起那衰老的擺渡夫。我舉目四顧，雖不見了那擺渡夫和他那古舊的渡船，但我似乎看見有一雙含着絕望和怨恨的眼睛，一瞬也不瞬的在凝視着橋頭的過客。</p>
<h3 id="c164">減膳 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 君健</p>
<p>「飯後有緊急會議，望全體同學參加，」我們的C英雄在飯廳報告。</p>
<p>午後六點半鐘。</p>
<p>同學都陸陸續續地來到了大禮堂，我們的C英雄，守在禮堂門口，一股兒英雄氣概，注視着每一個進來的同學。最後，密斯李姗姗地來了，C英雄，於是乎，一躍登台，宣布開會。</p>
<p>主席當然是我們的C英雄。</p>
<p>「今天開會的目的是减膳，把我們節省下來的膳費去買飛機援助東北義勇軍！」</p>
<p>「東洋人打進來了……義軍餐風宿露抗日……我們大學生，雖不能拿起槍桿子直接去打日本帝國主義，也必得與義軍共甘苦……把伙食减到最低限度……」</p>
<p>我們的英雄，演講了半點鐘，氣概非常激昻，尤其是當密斯李鼓掌的時候。</p>
<p>「每人减膳兩塊。」我們的W詩人提議。</p>
<p>「一塊！」T胖子提議。</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>通過：七塊錢一月的膳費中　每人减一塊。</p>
<p>星期六吃午飯的時候。</p>
<p>L運動家，下午要出去比賽，飯是要吃飽的。</p>
<p>一碗，兩碗，菜完了。L運動家撅着嘴，同桌的小王也似乎不滿意，鬍子先生　縐着眉毛。</p>
<p>「减膳，完全是拿我們窮小子開心，他們出風頭！」Ｌ運動家拍着桌子。</p>
<p>大家吃不飽，也都不平起來，一齊　着我們的Ｃ英雄。</p>
<p>Ｃ英雄的桌上有炒蛋，排骨，榨菜炒肉絲。哼！</p>
<p>運動家看紅了眼睛，跑邊去一把扯住我們Ｃ英雄今天所剛換的新領帶，吼着：</p>
<p>「「我們要與餐風宿露的義軍共甘苦，」好，英雄，我們一塊到東北去吧，光在密斯們面前唱高調是没有用的，走！」</p>
<p>Ｗ詩人着了慌，解勸：</p>
<p>「今天因爲怕有客來，所以添了這幾盤菜，並不是大家减膳，我們就吃好的。」</p>
<p>Ｔ胖子也凑來解勸：</p>
<p>「何必拉領帶動武，我們都是大學生，不要像野蠻人的舉動。」</p>
<p>這塲風波總算在半點鐘以内平靜下來了。</p>
<p>我們Ｃ英雄的領帶也没有扯斷，不過拉縐了一點，可是還不失美觀，所以也没另換新的，便急忙同Ｗ詩人和Ｔ胖子到上海大戲院去了，因爲怕密斯李先到那兒等久了要發氣呀。</p>
<h3 id="c165">不准想 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 鄂君</p>
<p>鎭壓「反動」的第一步，是不准人「動」。第二步是不准人「說話」；因爲說話有煽「動」的危險，如果將「話」寫在紙上，危險性更大。但說話的毛病是出在腦子裏會「想」：所以爲澈底鎭壓「反動」起見，還得不准人「想」。</p>
<p>現在鎭壓「反動」的第一步，似乎已經成功了。第二步，大概成功也不在遠了。祇是實行第三步，却有點困難。但我們不要以爲永遠想不出來。</p>
<p>而今是科學萬能時代，無線電可以將要人們的演說送到公子小姐們的耳朵裏，已故偵探小說家柯南道爾的影子會在照片上出現，（見前年報載），將來也許會有一個得諾貝爾獎金的「皇家科學者」，絞盡腦汁，發明一架機器或一面鏡子，能夠攝取幾萬萬人的影子和心裏秘密藏着的思想，用放大鏡放大，獻在「衛道」諸公面前。到那時候，魑魅魍魎均無所逃形，就是貌爲端正内藏奸邪的人，也將一一捉到，治以「居心不良」之罪。這麽一來，大家自然會貼貼服服地個個變成好人，不動，不說，而且，也不敢想了。到那時候，有可無所事，獵狗無所用，「衛道」諸公無「道」可「衛」，儘可以坐擁嬌娃，優哉游哉，以消永晝了。</p>

<p>「李一香是在發神經病，不要理他。……」</p>
<p>海泉知道唐耀星是陳華民的信徒，對於李一香似乎無甚信仰。但海泉喜歡讓李一香的新詩，所以他對唐耀星又稍稍抱了反感。</p>
<p>「構成派藝術大概是機械主義藝術吧。」</p>
<p>海泉從前稍翻過了一部機械主義文藝的理論書，所以向耀星提出來說。</p>
<p>「把武則天也寫成一個革命的姊姊，受着羣衆的擁護。這算是構成派藝術麽？」</p>
<p>海泉看見耀星的態度是那樣的傲慢，而所問又非所答，心裏實在不輸服。但也無可如何，便住了口。</p>
<p>大家吃着茶點，瞎談了一會。看看時候不早了。陳華民又立起身來。</p>
<p>「各位如果没有什麽提議或質問，那麽就散會吧。不過，在散會之前，我還有一個簡單的報告。從下星期起，Ｓ社總部决定派宣傳部長程先生來指導我們研究革命理論。每星期一次。不過時日和地點不能預定。屆時臨時通知。這是最要的工作。務必請各位踴躍參加。完了。」</p>
<p>海泉聽見後，有點躊躇起來了。他原來是爲研究文藝而參加這個文藝團體的，竟没有預料到這個文藝團體還附帶有許多工作，如示威游行革命問題社會問題研究等等。他想，縱令没有危險，以太麻煩了。但祇過了一瞬間，他又自責起來了。</p>
<p>「要站到前線去，在思想上不要太没志氣了！」</p>
<p>他暗暗地鼓勵了一下自己，便向他們告辭。當他走到他所素仰的李一香面前來告别時，一香忙從袖筒裏抽出一雙手掌來緊握了他的手。海泉覺得一香的手有一種近似女性的温滑的感觸。</p>
<p>「你稍等一忽，我們一路走吧。…………………………」</p>
<p>海泉給這位大作家挽留着，眞是受寵若驚，心裏有說不出來的高興，忙站在一邊，望着李一香和另一個身材高大的人在喁喁細語。他還和那些青年一個一個的交談，都是取這一套的公式，先低聲細語一番，然後拉了一拉手，最後哈哈地笑一聲，口裏連發，　　「我自有辦法，我自有辦法！」</p>
<p>海泉看見陳華民的態度，似乎對於李一香的那種行動表示不贊許，儘蹙着眉根，𢭵着厚唇苦笑，但不敢說什麽話。</p>

<h3 id="c186">收音機的選擇（三） <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 雄</p>
<p>收音機的選擇，旣需審察自己需要的情形。現在且把各人需要的情形，先來分析一下；丨丨</p>
<p>（一）業餘的研究。旣屬研究性質，則自鑛石機起以及最新式極複雜長短波的收音機止，可以隨便選擇，不成問題。</p>
<p>（二）個人用的。此指個人僅用耳機收聽而言。在播音台附近，可以購備鑛石機，但亦限於播音台不十分多，電波不致干涉的地方，在上海便不能了。距播音台較遠的地方可以用單管再生式收音機。更遠的則加高週率放大。欲聲音較響則須加低週率放大。</p>
<p>（三）家庭用的，此不求其過響，過響則將妨害鄰家，惹人憎惡。僅全家可以聽聞已足。可就個人可以聽聞的程度，附加二級的低週率放大。或用新式的五極管，以作擴大。</p>
<p>（四）大衆用的。此則必須有豐富的音量，以購買現成的收音機爲便。</p>
<p>（五）旅行用的，或可移動的。因不能裝備天地線之故，必須擇良好的收音機</p>
<p>其次電源方面亦須加以相當的考慮。鑛石機無需電源，可不必說，凡屬眞空管收音機，均不能不有電源。在山鄕僻壤無電燈設備之處，非全體用乾電不可。有的地方，夜間有電，日中無電，則可用蓄電池供Ａ電之用。若日夜有電者，自可用交流收音機。</p>
<p>各地電燈廠之電，有用直流的，亦有用交流的，用直流的，不能接用交流機，用交流的，不能接用直流機。同一用交流，而其電壓亦有不同，有用一一○弗打的，亦有用二二○的。所以在購備以前，均須預先考慮明白。</p>
<p>目前市上出售的收音機，種類繁多，講機者往往苦於選擇。但此種收音機均各有其特異之點，或則價廉，或以音響，或則携帶便利，或則聲音眞切。我們實不能强指其何者爲優何者爲劣。但若能照各地方及自己所需要的情形，從事購備，則於經濟利便，兩得其宜。將來有暇擬就市上各種收音機的特點，及何者適合於何種情形，略加剖述。</p>
<h3 id="c187">微光無線電之原理及發射 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>本報在幾個月以前有一叚新聞，說是國際電報公司由倫敦至巴黎試騐微光無線電話成功。並謂此種短波發報機之天線長不及一吋，每秒鐘之震動數可達三十萬萬次云。</p>
<p>按此種短波即Ｏuasi　Optical　Sboitwave凡波長由十公尺至數公分者均屬之。故其波長與光波波長相近。此種短波之發生那利用眞空管。但其發波方法則與普通不同，因其係用電子振盪Electron　Oscilfation故也。何爲電子振盪，請看第一圖：</p>
<p>第一圖　燈絲F通過電流因生熱而發生電子，但以栅極G環繞F並荷高壓正電，故由F發生之電子被G吸引。同時因G之面積極小故多數之電子並不爲其吸收而穿過栅極孔隙向荷有較高負電壓之屏極P進行。但至某一第二圖</p>
<p>點時由同性相斥之緣故，電子即被拒絕而退回。圖中之虚線即表示電子進行之路。因每秒鐘電子被引被斥之循環次數極高，即被利用爲電子振盪。最簡單之電子。最簡單之電子振盪線路如第二圖。</p>
<p>第三圖　線天收接　線天射發</p>
<p>V爲99或27。凡屏栅爲圓筒形之眞空管均適用之。</p>
<p>AA爲裝置天線用之銅管。</p>

<p>丨發見歐姆定律者丨</p>
<p>歐姆（Geory　Simon　Ohm1787-1854）是德國的物理學家生於南德意志梅茵河上流的愛冷根（Erlungon)。一八一七年任可洛紐的傑斯伊脫大學的敎授，一八三三年改充奴倫堡的高等工業學校的敎授，一八五二年又任繆尼希大學的實騐物理學敎授，後來就死在門占。他的著作，關於電流理論方面的最多，尤其是一八二七年在柏林刋行的　Galvanische　Kette　Mathematisch　Bearbeitet最爲有名。顯示電流，電壓電阻的關係的歐姆法則，就是他所發見的，所以電阻單位之稱「歐姆」，也就是紀念的功績，歐姆的電流理論，與法理愛的熱傳導的理論極相近似，如以法氏理論上的温度爲電位，電流爲聲流，則與歐氏的理論幾可說是完全同一的。</p>

<p>一勞永逸的改良單根天綫</p>
<p>普通引入線，大概繞在或銲在天線上的，日子一久，都不免有鬆脫之虞。如果在天綫的本身長度上，留下一小部份，作爲引入線，（見圖）那麽任便經過多少日子，也不會發生變化了。並且天綫的長度减少還可增加選擇性，這一點在播音台特多的上海，尤其是十分需要的。</p>
<p>不怕風吹的活動拉綫</p>
<p>天線拉線過緊，容易被風吹斷，過鬆則效率减低，形式亦不好看。最好拉線經過滑車後，在下邊掛上一個適當重量的鐡錘，這樣天線的鬆與緊，鐡錘都能自動調節。</p>
<p>燒掉的眞空管一變而爲眞空管的救命恩人</p>
<p>把燒壞或是陳舊没用的眞空管，浸在水中煮沸，經過幾分鐘後，玻管便能脫離。餘下的膠管，可設法裝一相當電莊的小電珠。（見圖）試騐時，在没有插入眞空管之前，先將膠管插入燈座，測量燈絲電壓有無接錯，這樣可以避免許多意外的損失。</p>

<p>— 金雲樵</p>
<p>（二）多根式　或以環境關係，不適於裝單根式時，可採用多根式，以等長之天線二根，或三四根，照單根式法，並行裝置，每根之長度，勿短過十公尺，各線相距須在一英尺以上，此式之電容量，較單根爲大。</p>
<p>（三）V字式　用於地位迫窄之處極佳。此式一線有二方向，收聽電台，可較單向者爲多，引入線最佳接於V字形之折角處。</p>
<p>（四）籠式　此式據實騐，電阻較平頂式者爲小，效力較佳，惟裝置費事，用者不多。高約二十公尺左右，每根長約二十五公尺。</p>
<p>（五）傘式　此式多用於大電台，俾電波之散射，能力加强。</p>
<p>（六）分濾式　此式係參酌變壓器原理而成</p>
<p>，（如圖二）1爲中心線，可用十八號皮線爲之，其作用彷彿變壓器之初級線圈，兩端通地，成大環狀。2爲較細之漆包線三百呎，環繞於中心線之外，一如變壓器之次級線圈，電浪感應於中心線後，再感應於外面天線圈，再加天第二圖　引入綫　地</p>
<p>線圈本身直接所收之電浪感應電壓，故所收電音，較普通天線爲强。</p>
<p>屋外天線除上述各式外，尙有L式，扇式，環狀式，T式等種種，無非以形式不同，而異其名。限於篇幅，恕不枚用舉，又電燈之架線，亦可借作天線之，（如圖三）1爲電燈線之任何一根，用作天線，（如兩根併用亦可，惟須裝兩只固定儲電容器，或以一根爲天線，一根爲地線，均無不可。）2爲開關，或閘刀，3爲固定電容器，其容量約0002MF.D.須能耐受第三圖　地綫</p>
<p>高電壓者，否則多燒毁之虞。但用電燈線作天線，危險性極多，以不用爲宜。</p>
<p>（B）屋内天綫　（一）環狀式　此式以十字形木架，（或金屬架，）繞絕緣銅綫若干圈，作正方形，或長方形，即其他幾何形式亦可，（如圖四）普通平行天綫之長度，較環狀式者爲長，故電容量較大，但誘導率則較小。須配以相當大之誘導綫圈。環狀天綫，因其繞成環形，雖誘導率較大，但其收音能力則遠不及屋外天綫也。</p>
<p>環狀天綫即爲綫圈之放大者。各圈間之距離，與誘導率成正比，距離近，誘導率大，圈數宜少；距離遠，誘導率小，圈數應多。普通收受二百至五百公尺電，之環狀天線，如木架甲至乙，丙至乙（參看圖四）之長度，爲二十吋，各柱相距十吋，十六圈已夠。若相距四分之一吋時，則十四圈亦可應用。</p>

<p>— 微</p>
<p>（五）歐姆定律</p>
<p>上面說過，電流通過各種導體，有易於流通的，有不易流通的。這因爲導體對於電流的阻力有種種不同之故。金屬體大體善通電流，所以也稱良導體。反之有多種物質，電流雖能勉强流通，而阻力甚大，容易使電流減弱的，稱爲不良導體。至如玻璃瓷器油質等等許多物質，其電阻力之大，竟使電流不能通過的，則稱爲絕緣體，（Insulator）各種電機實在就是良導體不良導體與絕緣體三者巧妙的組合。</p>
<p>那末，電流與電壓電阻三者之間究竟有某</p>
<p>水壓高則水流大，阻力大（例如用細管子通水）</p>
<p>以說是和水壓成正比，和阻力成反比。電流</p>
<p>，和電阻成反比。若用算式來表示，則如下</p>
<p>電流（安培）＝電壓（弗打）　電阻（歐姆）</p>
<p>安培，爲電流的單位，弗打（或譯伏脫，伏爾次）爲電壓的單位，歐姆爲電阻的單位（請參看本刋所載「電之單位」一文）。普通恒以Ｉ代表電流，Ｅ代表電壓，Ｒ代表電阻。所以上面的公式就成爲</p>
<p>Ｉ＝Ｅ－Ｒ</p>
<p>這個公式是德國人歐姆發見的（請參看本期無線電界之人物）所以也稱歐姆定律。這定律是我們研究電學以及無線電學一個再重要的基本法則。無論交流直流均可適用。從這個定律，我們可以設計種種電機，（自然更複雜的公式還有。）牠的意思就是說在有電阻Ｒ歐姆的導體上，加以Ｅ弗打的電壓，則可得一安培的電流。若電壓加倍，則電流亦加倍，電阻加倍，則電流减半。若把上式照代數式變化過來，則（一）</p>
<p>Ｈ＝ＩＲ</p>
<p>這就是說要在電阻爲Ｒ的導體上，通過電流Ｉ安培，則必須加以E弗打的電壓。又（二）</p>
<p>Ｒ＝Ｅ－Ｉ</p>
<p>這就是說有Ｅ電壓力加於導體兩端，而所流通的電流爲Ｉ安培，則該導線的電阻，即爲Ｒ歐姆。利用此式，我們可以計算眞空管收音機的燈絲電阻器（Ｒbeostat）的歐姆值。譬如UX20IA眞空管，其燈絲電壓僅須5弗打，電流爲25安培，若用6弗打之蓄電池，則電壓多過一弗打，必用電阻器减少之。所以</p>
<p>R=E-I=6-5-.25=i-.25=歐姆</p>
<p>就是說電阻器至少須要四歐姆，若用6歐姆之耗阻器，即甚安全。</p>

<p>如將木架縮爲每邊長十六吋，各圈相距四分之一吋時，爲十六圈，相距半吋時，爲二十圈，配以０００５Ｍ.F.D.可變電容器，其中心丁至戊，至少相距八吋。面積較小之環狀天線，雖便携帶，但效力較遜。</p>
<p>環狀天綫有定向性，如其平面與發電站相對時，所收電浪最强，成直角時，最弱。船舶所用之測向器，亦係根據此理而作，又有複式環狀天線，係於大環内多一小環，用於特種線路中（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c193">電之單位（三） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 均</p>
<p>（四）電阻之單位</p>
<p>電流之强度不但和電動力的大小有關，和導線之種類形狀亦有關係。從同一電池（即電動力相等）中發生出來的電流，若用銅綫爲導線，其電流必比用鐡線爲導線時强大，若用同種導線，則形狀較短較粗者，其電流必比較長較細者爲强大。導線之此種性質，即阻止電流，使其强度减小之作用，稱爲電阻（Ｒesistance),或稱耗阻。每一導線各有一定之電阻。電阻之單位呌做歐姆（Ｏhm），或略稱歐。一歐之值爲導線兩端之電壓爲一弗，電流强度爲一安時所呈的電阻，實際上等於攝氏零度時斷面一平方耗長一○六·三糎水銀柱時於一不變電流所呈的電阻。</p>
<p>電阻在公式中用字母Ｒ表之。</p>
<p>計量較大或較小之電阻另用兩種單位：</p>

<h3 id="c196">史德華一○六型收音機之特點（續） <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 振之</p>
<p>○廻路</p>
<p>○廻路（Ｓquelcher　Cercuit）與電</p>
<p>臺間噪音鎭壓之聯絡情形如下。收音機若只有電臺間噪音鎭壓器，實際上並不能完全割除天電的高音種擊。若收音機之敏銳性減至能將天電衝擊完全割除，結果勢必將本埠各强力電臺之電波，亦完全逐出。</p>
<p>○廻路之作用在使收音機限於收取某預定强度以上的音號，而將此强度以下的音號或天電噪音一律隔絕。圖二的曲綫表示一個音號在普通收音機上自漸漸諧入時至漸漸諧出時的音量。此線自完全没有聲音的Ａ點昇至最響的Ｂ點漸漸下降至完全没有聲音的Ｃ點。若收音機用了Ｑ廻路，則當其又諧入某電臺時，可得一截然不同之結果。這時候所收得的音是突然在Ｄ點出現的，在該音出現以前並無任何嗤嗤的雜音。我們若繼續配諧，就可聽見此音號沿ＤＢＥ曲線進行，待到了Ｐ點，Ｑ廻路又立刻顯現其機能，將其以下的微弱的嗤嗤聲，突然割除。</p>
<p>由此可見，Ｑ廻路之又一特點，顯然是能改良收音機的選擇性，因爲自電臺發來的音號，現在諧入的祇是ＦＧ一段，而不像普通收音機那樣地須爲ＡＣ全段。Ｑ廻路若與電臺間噪音鎭壓器並用，則當配音於兩電臺間時，可不必將銳敏性過分滅弱，因爲Ｑ廻路的割除作用，會有效地防止天電噪音及各種雜音之闖入。</p>
<p>在這里我們必須注意，因了這Ｑ廻路的存在，偶然會發生一種新的阻礙，不過這是很容易排除的。假使電臺間噪音鎭壓器所控制之一點，有一極弱的電臺，而其最高音號不能超過圖二中的ＤＦ線之長，則Ｑ廻路就會把這音號的高音部分接收，而割除其較弱的音，使其收得的音號成爲一種像窒息似的聲音。其防止的方法很簡單，只要略爲增進電臺間噪音鎭壓的力量，那末這音號就會清晰而没有阻礙了。</p>
<p>延緩自動音最操縱</p>
<p>從前普通的收音機，當其收得任何電臺的播音時，無論該電臺是强是弱，其自動音最操縱作用都立即發揮其機能，這種裝置能減弱低電臺音號的力量，至不可聽聞。</p>
<p>一○六型機之特點，能使自動音量操縱對於較弱電臺之音號不起作用，以其非必要也。然而若遇一電臺，其音量極大，足以供給全部出力時，這自動音量操縱就會立即呈現其作用。普通收音機中即使具有極便利的自動音量操縱，但在收取較弱電臺的音號時，往往有衰落（Ｆading）的現象發生，有了這種延緩自動音量操縱作用，即可減少此弊。（完）</p>

<p>（開放政權）　（記者問）中央决定開放政權、是否係放棄一黨專政、抑係將少數人握有之治權、歸還多數人之意、（孫氏謂）三中全會議决、於二十四年四月召開國民大會、現决提前舉行、並提早頒布憲法、但此問題、尙須待本年七月之全國代表大會决定、無所謂開放政權、因憲法旣已提早頒布、訓政時期約法及中政會所訂之訓政綱領、均失時效、政府已將政權歸還國民、政權旣爲人民所公有、因無所謂開放也、（問）屆時是否放棄一黨專政、憲法須明文規定、准許人民自由設立政黨否、（答）憲法旣頒布人民有集會結社之自由、則設立政黨、亦爲憲法所允許之事、在憲法條文上、當然無須有明文規定之必要、</p>
<p>（參政問題）　氏又謂、國民參政會組織、現正由立法院審查中、現全國代表大會、提前於七月舉行、决定召開臨時國民大會問題、參政會已無召集之必要、因國民大會、爲政府最高之機關、參政會僅係過渡時期之民意機關故也、如國民大會提前開會、憲法當然須提早公佈、其起草時期、亦須縮短、至國民大會組織法及選舉法、其原則大致可由下週中政會决定、</p>
<p>（團結禦侮）　政府對日、已無外交可言、蔣公使亦已奉召歸國、此後惟視能抗日而後始有外交、此種一貫政策、迄未變更、現中央對抗日軍事、首爲鞏固陣地、攻則可收復失地、守則可保持現有領土、否則守且不能、遑論進攻、故能團結一致、實爲全國總動員之前題、欲達到目的、又非刷新政治、增加實力不可、目今吾人痛心者、中國非純粹統一之國家、政令不能達於邉疆、各省地方自治、尙未完成、民意與政府隔閡、故多數意見、主（一）集中與團結全國民意、提前召開國民大會、提早公布憲法、開放政權、（二）刷新政治、使中央與各省、收指臂之效、而能嚴守紀律、（三）勵行地方自治、溝通民意、此三事完成、抗日始有力量、否則一切將爲空談、無補於實際、</p>
<p>（望馮南下）　孫氏最後謂、中央對馮玉祥氏自去年即希望其南下、於函電往返、並有人赴張家口敦促、以余憶測、馮當能負相當責任、至名義尙未定、</p>

<p>（第二信）（三月一日）</p>
<p>密執安州銀行風潮　造成新的銀行恐慌、一切政府和聯合儲蓄銀行用以撲滅銀行恐慌的對策、盡歸無效、恐慌一如燎原之火、日在擴大密執安、俄海阿、英的安納、奕倫諾斯、曼麗蘭、紐折爾西、衣阿華、俄先拉荷馬、威士干遜、内布拉斯加、佛魯里達、阿甘色、米蘇爾厘、加里佛尼亞各州、都捲入恐慌之漩渦、即美國四十八州中、十四州已入恐慌狀態、更重要的是恐慌已直接迫近紐約、而正面威協銀行街丨金元大王的堡壘了、</p>
<p>二月二十五日、曼麗蘭州政府宣告、對所有二百零五家銀行（共有資本八八九百萬金元）、均准予限制提欵、理由是因爲在最近一星期内全州已提之欵、總共不過千三百萬金元、是一個很小的數目、已使巴爾的瑪耳銀行陷於動搖狀態了、這是表明銀行局面極度削弱的信號、表明這種局面怎樣危險的信號、表明幾百銀行爲甚麽因爲初期的小小的風潮便迫得不能不停業的信號、</p>
<p>二月二十七日銀行恐慌又曾繼續擴大、克勒維蘭（俄海阿州）和英的安納堡所有存欵、只許提取百分之五、所有儲蓄欵項一律停止三十天、阿克羅（俄海阿州）五個銀行共有存欵六千五百萬金元和股本一萬萬金元、每月只許提取存欵百分之一、麗瑪（俄爾阿州）實行限制付欵、阿甘色威士甘遜米蘇爾尼各州的銀行同樣被迫停業、</p>
<p>救濟密執安州五百家陷於恐慌的銀行之活動、曾費了很大的力量、福特（HonrgFord）直等到受了最大的壓力之後、才被迫從事救濟他的私人銀行的工作、他曾經觀望了很久、他的重要的理由是、根據他的觀點、美國整個的銀行制度是必然崩潰的、但最後他終於决定、把改組他的私人銀行之股本、增至八百二十五萬金元、然而這個數目比較起來是很小的、因爲「財政改組協會」（Retfco）國立救濟機關、曾付出七千八百萬金元、聯邦儲蓄銀行曾付出二千萬金元、支加哥銀行曾付出二千萬金元、以作應付支付百分之三十的存欵之用、</p>
<p>同時華盛頓政府、迅雷不及掩耳地、頒佈一條法令、給「貨幣本位監督」以不准提取國立銀行存欵的大權、所有服從聯合儲蓄銀行章程的六一五○家銀行、都在不准提取存欵之列、但是這樣有大權的銀行委員、如果他没有新的更大的欵項、以作救濟之用、那他能否有成效、還是一個很大的問題、</p>
<p>現在很明白的是財政改組協會在救濟銀行上的全部工作、都没有成績、正月早就有三百四十八家銀行已經發生恐慌、二月份被迫停業和限制付欵的銀行、當在一千家以上、財政改組委員會去年曾經實行救濟工作、現在亦從事這種工作、但現在的救濟工作、就是要國家給他以萬萬的欵項、然而現時國家若支付這樣大的欵項、是不能不引起貨幣本位嚴重的危險的、</p>
<p>這樣、銀行恐慌又從新極銳利地提出貨幣本位的問題、以羅斯福爲中心的一輩新人物們好像還要保持金本位似的、可是他們的一切解釋都不足以阻止金元之跌價、如果銀行恐慌繼續擴大、需要新的援助的話、那政府是否不被迫而變更她的對於貨幣本位的觀點、還是問題、暫時政府還是不援助銀行而支持貨幣本位、</p>
<p>然而貨幣本位、隨著銀行恐慌之繼續尖銳化、而至於不能維持、也不是不可能的事、</p>
<p>一般經濟學者雖然繼續努力、企圖　糊這次新恐慌之國際意義、但現在他們却不能不承認、美國這次銀行恐慌、是資本主義世界恐慌之新的發動、并且是在較高的基礎上的發動、現在只需把美國銀行恐慌、在整個國際信用交易上所已引起的動搖和將來必然引起的動搖、加以研究、便知道她的國際意義了、</p>
<p>二月二十六日、柏林日報表示贊成賓列爾、說「恐慌終了」的夢、現在是已經醒了、「世界經濟天上的銀河、以前曾給與巴本計劃以重要的光明的、現在又暗淡無光了、去年夏天原料之極度騰貴、不久也就消沈了、人們早就知道美國恐慌是火山的暴發、現在又眼見這種危險病症重新來到了」、</p>
<p>資本主義經濟恐慌同樣不能不影響到政治現狀、由美國取消國際債務的空想、現在又被打破了、世界市塲上互相屠殺的競爭、在極度地尖銳化、帝國主義的衝突行將很快地變成世界戰爭、</p>

<p>(Luanzhou) On the 31st, the enemy attacked the Shimen Village front with superior forces. After being fiercely repulsed by Yao's division and Jin's regiment, they did not advance further until noon. During probing attacks, the enemy continued to reinforce their troops in the evening, reaching over 3,000, with more than ten artillery pieces, determined to capture Shimen Village. A fierce battle is expected to occur at Shimen Village line today. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) According to a Haiyang phone call, there is no confirmed report regarding the alleged defection of Zhang and Yu. The enemy's movements in Yu suggest their intention, as judged here, is to attack our Shimen Village. Our front line is composed, not falling for the enemy's plan. As expected, around 6:00 AM on the 31st, the enemy first used about 200 Japanese-puppet infantry and cavalry, along with two aircraft, to jointly press towards the Xiangshui outpost. By 7:00 AM, enemy reinforcements, approximately 2,000 strong, arrived and launched a fierce joint land and air assault, breaking through the Shahe Village position. Our troops occupied the southwestern and northwestern highlands, fighting fiercely against the enemy. Yao's division and Jin's regiment at the Shimen Village line have concentrated all their forces to defend it, awaiting a bloody fight with the enemy. Shimen Village is expected to be safe. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu At about 4:00 AM today, approximately 2,000 Japanese-puppet troops from the Jiukou area advanced towards our Shimen Village on two fronts. One route attacked our Xiangshui guard unit from Jiukou, while the other flanked our Shahe position via Huangtuling Pass, Wangjialou, and Yingwu Mountain. Our troops are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese aircraft reconnoitered the Haiyang Shihe area for a long time before heading east. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu At 11:00 AM today, the enemy continued to attack our He army's Shahe Village position, 囗division troops. At the same time, enemy artillery fire was extremely intense, and three aircraft dropped countless bombs over our positions. One platoon leader of our Jin regiment was killed in action, and dozens of soldiers were wounded or killed. The enemy suffered even greater casualties than us. Fighting is still ongoing. At noon, enemy aircraft returned to Shimen Village and other places, dropping many bombs. The extent of the damage is unknown. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu At about 3:00 PM today, an enemy supply train arrived at Yuguan, transporting ammunition and supplies to Jiukou. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e2">Deployment of Enemy Forces Attacking Rehe <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to military news, the deployment of enemy forces attacking Rehe is as follows: (1) The 6th Division (Itamoto) is based in Lingyuan, with its 11th Brigade (Matsuda), including the 13th and 47th Regiments, currently moving south from the Chifeng area in northern Rehe.

<h3 id="e3">The Xifeng Front Is Quiet; Liu's Division Has Advanced Towards Shouwangfen; Enemy Aircraft Bomb the Xiaojiaying Area <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Our Front Line at Gubeikou Extended More Than Ten Li</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Zunhua phone call, after Liu Ruming's division's cavalry occupied Banbishan in the Luowenyu area, they dispatched more troops to establish a strong defense. Our cavalry has entered Shouwangfen Town, and the enemy is retreating towards the Chengde line. Our troops are now only dozens of li from Chengde. There have been only small contacts in recent days, with no fierce battles. The Xifengkou area was quiet and peaceful all night yesterday. It is rumored that the enemy is waiting for reinforcements. Once the new troops arrive, they will launch a counterattack against us. Song has been inspecting the positions on the front line for several days and has ordered the rear reserve troops to assist the people in repairing roads to facilitate transportation. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At our army's front line in Xiaojiayingzi, from the 22nd to the 26th, the Japanese army concentrated its forces to attack us several times and launched a night attack once, all without success. They then sent four aircraft to bomb Jianchangying, Madaogou, Yaozhuang, and other places, a total of six times. Many civilian houses in various places were destroyed, resulting in extremely heavy losses. On the night of the 27th, the Japanese army switched to using mountain guns to bombard our army's positions, increasing from four guns to sixteen, with very intense firepower. Many farmlands were bombed into holes. The Japanese side intends to wait for reinforcements. There will be fierce battles in Lengkou in the next two or three days. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Gubeikou front has been extremely quiet these days, and Japanese aircraft have not come. Our army's front line has been extended by more than ten li. A certain unit of ours has reached the vicinity of the Upper Eighteen Bend Ridge. In the Malanguan area, Pang's unit has reached Xinglong County, Jiangjunguan, and Huangyaguan, making contact with a certain unit. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the advance team of our Liu Division occupied Banbishan in Luowenyu, they did not move out. There was no fighting in the Xifengkou area. Song personally went to the front line of Xifengkou a few days ago to inspect, and the area was peaceful. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Kailu telegram, at dawn on the 30th, eight enemy aircraft flew to Xiaojiaying and Lengkou to bomb back and forth for several hours. Our troops took cover and retaliated with anti-aircraft machine guns. The enemy aircraft did not dare to fly low, and the bombs missed their target, causing no damage. In the enemy corpses seized by our army on the morning of the 29th, photos, badges, and notebooks were found. The notebooks contained names such as Ebisawa Hayao, who was the company commander of the 6th Company of the 45th Regiment of the enemy's 6th Division. This proves that the enemy on the front line outside Lengkou is indeed the Ojima Detachment of the 45th Regiment of the 36th Brigade of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Zunhua phone call, at 6:00 AM this morning, three enemy aircraft flew to Xifengkou, Luowenyu, Malanguan, Sahaqiao, Santunying, and other areas to reconnoiter and drop bombs. Our defending soldiers used anti-aircraft machine guns and artillery to repel the enemy aircraft. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan is dispatching teams to repair the road from Zunhua to Banbishan in Luowenyu to facilitate military transport. Many slogans, documents, maps, and other items were obtained from the enemy's retreat position and will be sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for reference. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Haicheng, the chief of the military supplies department of Shang Zhen, returned to Ping from the front. He said that the enemy invading Lengkou this time is the main force of the 10th Division, which has launched fierce attacks since the 20th of this month, dozens of times in total. Our troops engage the enemy with guns at a distance, and with knives at close range. Hand grenades are also very effective. These hand grenades are made by the Jin Bing Arsenal and can explode in a 50-meter square area. Shang personally supervised the battle at a certain location 20 li from Lengkou. All the soldiers are determined to die for their country, and their morale is extremely high. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Recent newspapers have reported that Shao Benliang, a Rehe army who defected to the enemy, has changed his mind and is about to defect to us. Yesterday, a telegram was received from Kaiping, stating that the enemy is constructing barbed wire and laying landmines near Xishuangshan, about 50 li northeast of Lengkou. Shao Benliang's troops are currently deployed in the Wuzhishan area, north of Datanadian, to cover the enemy's left flank. This proves that Shao is incorrigible and willingly continues his defection.

The enemy has occupied the Maojiakou, Laoye Temple, and Xujialing areas. The enemy's front line is Li Jichun's puppet army, with hundreds of Japanese soldiers participating. Our troops are currently firmly defending Yiyuan Pass. There have been local battles recently.

<p>(Beiping) After suffering repeated defeats along the Great Wall, the Japanese army has now changed its strategy, withdrawing its troops to eastern Chahar, intending to drive our volunteer armies into Chahar territory, so that Chengde will not be threatened. They have also transferred the 16th Division and seven regiments from Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces to join the Great Wall line. They are currently deploying troops, so there have been no fierce battles at the passes in recent days. The Japanese army in the Dolon area is being very careful to prevent our flanking attacks.

<p>(Nanjing) Sun Wei, the prosecutor of the Jiangning District Court, has filed a public prosecution against the cases of Zheng Yuxiu, Niu Chuan'chun, Yang Zhaoyu, Zheng Huichen, and others for corruption. In addition to detailing the facts of the crime and the circumstances of the joint corruption, the reasons for the prosecution are as follows: The defendants in this case are all civil servants, taking advantage of their official positions to jointly embezzle property in official custody, which constitutes the crime of conspiracy to commit Article 42 of the Criminal Law and Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Although their acts of embezzlement were carried out successively, they were based on a general intention. According to the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 665, they should be regarded as continuous offenses in accordance with Article 75 of the same law. In addition, Yang Zhaoyu destroyed evidence related to other people's criminal cases, which constitutes the crime of Article 175 of the same law. However, since the most severe penalty for this article is imprisonment for a term of less than one year, and the matter occurred before March 5, 1932, in accordance with Article 1 of the Amnesty Act, he should be exempted from prosecution in accordance with Article 253, Section 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Therefore, the prosecution is filed in accordance with Sections 1 and 2 of Article 253 of the Criminal Procedure Law. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, Army Commander Sun Dianying telegraphed condolences to Division Commander Guan Linzheng from the front lines. There was a most tragic sentence in the telegram: "We are waiting for you on the front lines." How magnificent those words are! We truly hear his voice and see his person.</p>
<p>Yue Wu Mu said it well: "If civil officials do not want money and military officials are not afraid of death, then the world will be at peace." The reason why our country today cannot defend its territory and cannot resist insults is that a large nation with vast land and many people has been turned into a fish on the chopping block, at the mercy of others. Although the reasons for this are diverse, "civil officials wanting money and military officials being afraid of death" is the most important reason. The people provide their blood and sweat to support the army, exceeding two million men. However, with such a huge army, they are only tools for internal warfare. As for the great enemy of our nation, they sit and watch, or even guide the enemy to penetrate deep. How can such irresponsible soldiers not be moved to the core and feel ashamed when they hear Army Commander Sun shouting the tragic cry, "We are waiting for you on the front lines," on the front lines?</p>
<p>In the January 28th Battle of Shanghai, the people of the whole country enthusiastically donated and warmly cared for the soldiers fighting against the Japanese. This time, they also admire and love the soldiers on the front lines outside the passes. Therefore, we believe that under the current circumstances, soldiers have the most opportunities to serve the country and are most likely to win the favor of the people, renewing the people's aversion to soldiers over the past 20 years. If, under such circumstances, the soldiers of the whole country still cannot shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and resisting Japan, then they are truly willing to be the criminals of the nation.</p>
<p>Looking back at history, the demise of every country has been due to civil officials wanting money, making politics as chaotic as tangled silk, and military officials being afraid of death, leaving the country without the power to defend itself. When foreign invaders come, they either watch from the other side of the river or fight on their own. In recent history, the demise of the Ming Dynasty was due to this. However, the current situation in our country is as dangerous as it was at the end of the Ming Dynasty. We are already standing on the line of life and death. If we are unwilling to let our nation perish, now is the last time to awaken and the last time to save the country. Rush to the front lines! There are people on the front lines waving to us. People all along the line are nodding to us. The soldiers of the whole country should rise up and go to the front lines to fight with their blood and flesh. The people of the whole country, in particular, should rise up and do their best to serve the country, uniting their spirit with that of the soldiers on the front lines. This is the only way out for our nation today.</p>
<p>"We are waiting for you on the front lines." This voice is tragic and powerful. We should treat it as a battle drum for a charge, as a bugle call to mobilize the whole nation. Answer with one voice: Coming… Coming!</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After the Diet, which adjourned on March 25, passed all military proposals, the Ministry of the Army has now announced procedures for expanding the army, including a provision to form new squads of junior and non-commissioned officers from the active and reserve lists, numbering approximately 100,000 in total.

In addition, the number of students in the officer academies will be increased to 360, the equipment of military training schools in various locations will be improved, a training school for gas warfare will be established, and military dogs will be trained on a large scale at the Kanto Infantry School. In the past, the conscription system had a provision that paying a certain fee could shorten the term of military service, but this has now been removed. Some lieutenants and second lieutenants on the reserve list will be transferred to the active list, and the number of sergeants on the active list will also be greatly increased. (31st Reuters)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Following the Japanese government's withdrawal from the League of Nations, relations between Japan and the United States and between Japan and Russia are becoming increasingly complex. The Japanese military, to prepare for any eventuality, is not only adding the latest military airfield in Taiwan in the south, but is also building the latest military airfields in Aomori, Sendai, and Sapporo on the mainland. The main purpose is to link Taiwan in the south, defend Hokkaido in the north, and plan for coordinated aviation communication to provide wartime rescue and transport of military supplies. The cost is set at 1.6 million yen, and it is expected to begin in April and be completed before the Army, Navy, and Air Force's grand maneuvers in August. (31st China United Press)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In order to encourage national unity and suppress domestic revolutionary movements after withdrawing from the League of Nations, the Japanese government recently convened a meeting of police chiefs, using the pretext of an emergency situation to plan the expansion and strengthening of the voluntary police officer system. The Police Affairs Bureau has already submitted a standard proposal, ordering all prefectures to immediately commence organization. The basic content of the proposal is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"Outline of the Voluntary Police Officer System" (1) Each prefecture should, based on the following qualifications, begin investigation and registration: (A) Those with police officer experience and a robust physique eligible for pensions; (B) Those without pension eligibility but with police officer experience and personal desire; (C) Those without police officer experience but with firefighter experience and a desire among youth corps members. (2) Using the registration system, the first phase of organization will center around each police station, and the second phase will center around the prefecture, with group training provided. (3) In wartime or during incidents requiring a large number of police officers, outstanding individuals may be selected from the voluntary police officers and appointed as police officers. (4) Voluntary police officers will regularly receive training stipends, and substantial compensation will be provided in the event of casualties during incidents. (5) The authority of voluntary police officers will be defined accordingly. The establishment of the system will be funded with subsidies from the national treasury.

<p>(Washington) Japanese delegate to the League of Nations, Yosuke Matsuoka, arrived here today and told people that he intends to stay for at least three days, visiting various key figures in the US government and seeking an audience with the President, though he has no specific mission, merely an informal discussion. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese delegate to the League of Nations, Yosuke Matsuoka, declared to press representatives, "The United States and Japan are the two major powers of the Pacific and should maintain amity to safeguard peace. Japan is not China's enemy and desires to see China well-organized so that Japan can smoothly sell its merchandise." He also stated that Japan does not desire to rule China, and the fact that the United States abandoned the Philippines, as well as the difficulties faced by Britain in handling its territories, further dissuade Japan from the idea of ruling China. Matsuoka further said that the concentration of the entire US Navy fleet in the Pacific is actually a source of anxiety for Japan. Because Japanese public opinion is divided, the government has temporarily shelved negotiations for a non-aggression treaty with Russia, but it would be very beneficial for Japan and Russia to jointly organize a Manchurian committee to resolve the Siberian border dispute. The main point of divergence between the opinions of Japan and the United States lies in the matter of the permanent stationing of Japanese troops in Manchuria. Japan must protect "Manchukuo" and therefore it is necessary to station troops in Manchuria. The United States once adopted the Monroe Doctrine in South America, and Japan's situation in China is exactly the same. He also said that Japan would only invade inside the Great Wall if China took provocative action. As for the mandated territories in the Pacific islands after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, there would be absolutely no problem. In closing, Matsuoka denied the rumors circulating that Japan was building fortresses on the Pacific mandated islands, saying there was no such thing. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Soviet Russia Detains Over 4,000 Railway Cars; Japan Instigates Puppet Manchukuo to Demand Three Items</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to diplomatic sources, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is taking a provocative approach towards Russia over the Chinese Eastern Railway issue for two reasons: Firstly, the Japanese have been secretly planning to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway for several years, but the opportunity had not yet arrived. However, the strong demands of the puppet Manchukuo Foreign Ministry continues and now there is an opportunity to instigate an incident. Secondly, it is a diplomatic constraint policy. The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that since Hitler came to power, he has vigorously pursued an anti-Russian policy, and British-Russian relations have deteriorated due to the arrest of British engineers. Japan is taking the opportunity to make things difficult for Russia, in order to achieve its long-cherished goals. (31st Lianhua Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, Soviet Russia has advocated international transportation and transported 4,500 locomotives and freight cars from the Chinese Eastern Railway to its own country. Despite repeated negotiations by "Manchukuo," they have refused to return them. Recently, they even plan to transport all the locomotives and freight cars of the Chinese Eastern Railway. On the 29th, "Manchukuo" blocked the transportation of Chinese Eastern Railway trains into Soviet Russia from the eastern and western borders of Manchouli and Borazitayevo. Relations between Russia and Manchukuo, centered around this transportation issue, are gradually becoming precarious and warrant serious attention. (31st Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a dispatch from Changchun, "Manchukuo" now wishes to resolve the issue of Chinese Eastern Railway freight cars with Soviet Russia in a moderate manner. It is said that there are a total of 4,000 freight cars and several passenger cars that have entered the Siberian Railway. The "Manchukuo" authorities have now put forward the following requests: (1) The locomotives and cars of the Chinese Eastern Railway shall not be allowed to enter the Siberian Railway in the future; (2) Freight cars transporting grain must comply with the normal tax regulations; (3) The distribution of the income of the Chinese Eastern Railway must be revised so that Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo" are on an equal footing. It is said that the above are the minimum requirements. The "Manchukuo" authorities are now expressing a spirit of goodwill, but at the same time, they are also expressing their determination to have their demands respected. According to a dispatch from Changchun, on March 28, Russian personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchouli attempted to drive four locomotives into the Siberian Railway but were stopped by local "Manchukuo" officials.

<p>(Tokyo) Siam, which abstained from voting and sided with Japan when the League of Nations General Assembly decided on a resolution, is gradually becoming closer to Japan. Japanese Railway Minister Tadatsugu Mitome invited the Siamese Minister of Railways to visit Japan in order to increase the amity between the two countries. This plan was made early on the 31st. However, Siam proceeded rather quickly after abstaining at the General Assembly. As a result of the Railway Ministry's request to the Foreign Ministry for negotiations, it has obtained the consent of the Siamese authorities. The Japanese Railway Ministry has decided to treat him as a guest of the Railway Ministry and invite him to inspect the actual situation of Japanese railways and commerce and industry. At the same time, it will express its gratitude for his actions in Geneva. It is said that the Siamese Railway Minister will visit Japan in mid-April when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

<p>Newchwang: The Newchwang coastal reconnaissance team is pursuing the pirates with the support of Japanese officials after British crew members were kidnapped, but no clues have been found. However, the pirates appear to have landed at Jiegou and fled towards Qingshui Gou. (31st Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Merchant Navigation Association, organized by British certified captains and crew members, protested to the Foreign Office today over the kidnapping of four crew members of the Nanchang steamer and requested prompt rescue measures. The association, based in Liverpool, issued a statement today saying that the news of such atrocities has shocked the shipping industry. British ships have been repeatedly attacked recently, and all those kidnapped by pirates have been subjected to various forms of abuse. This case is particularly egregious. Among the four kidnapped crew members, one, a Mr. Johnson, has a mother who has lost her memory for two years due to grief over the loss of her daughter. Now that her son has suffered an accident again, people dare not tell her. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Newchwang: Several Japanese aircraft flew around Newchwang yesterday to scout for traces of the pirates who kidnapped four British people from the Nanchang steamer on Wednesday, but found nothing. A large-scale reconnaissance will be conducted today. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is now known that the four crew members kidnapped from the Nanchang ship are all young men under the age of thirty, none of whom are married and none of whom speak Chinese. People here believe that the four kidnapped British people can be expected to be found soon, because there are no shelters on the ground in the four rural areas, unlike last year when Mrs. Pawley and others were kidnapped when sorghum was everywhere. According to the detailed information now available, the case occurred at 11:43 a.m., when two civilian ships, seemingly innocuous, approached the Nanchang ship. Soon eight people jumped onto the Nanchang ship, several of whom were wearing uniforms. After boarding the ship, they fired handguns indiscriminately, wounding two Chinese people on board. The four crew members in the kitchen were unable to draw their guns in time and were subdued by the pirates. Their aim was undoubtedly to kidnap foreigners. After hastily looting the crew members' cabins, the pirates took the four crew members away. When they went from the big ship to the civilian ship, there were another ten bandits in the small boat to provide support. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>▲Reuters Paris, 30th: The center of European politics has shifted from Geneva to Paris today. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu has already arrived here. He is a major figure in the formation of the Little Entente's administrative council and is recognized as the spokesperson for small countries. Tonight, Titulescu will meet with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Boncour to discuss the Roman plan to transform Europe. Titulescu is deeply concerned that the proposed European supervision system will exert psychological pressure on small countries, so his intention is to propose an answer to this pressure. Titulescu also wants to ascertain the attitude of the French government during his visit to Paris, because although the French government has stated its determination to abide by the League of Nations Covenant, it is also unwilling to be bound by its details. The French government has not publicly announced anything on this point, causing some in France to demand the replacement of the foreign minister and the reorganization of the cabinet.</p>
<p>▲Reuters London, 31st: Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu will arrive in London next week to state the Little Entente's opposition to the Four-Power Pact recently proposed by the British and Italian prime ministers in Rome.</p>

<p>England and France Seek Urgent Solution to War Debt Problem</p>
<p>The United States Shows a Tendency to Reduce Tariffs</p>
<p>▲ National, Washington, 30th - Reliable sources say that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have good reason to believe that France will soon pay the arrears of its December war debt. It is also reported that there is a movement to move the World Economic Conference from London to Washington, to be convened around May. These two pieces of news suggest that the U.S. government anticipates that the war debt issue can be resolved before the economic conference is convened. It is reported that the U.S. government is preparing to begin talks on war debt as soon as Congress resolves domestic emergency issues. The various records exchanged between Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador Lindsay have been studied by experts, and it is said that the records collected this time are extremely detailed, with some parts to be used in the economic conference. Therefore, many parties believe that since these records have been sent to the U.S., and the economic experts from England and France will be sent to the U.S. to discuss war debt, it might as well move the economic conference to Washington. In addition, there is another piece of news that many foreign correspondents believe to be true: if the economic conference is convened here and the war debt is resolved by then, the United States will be willing to greatly reduce tariffs, as long as other countries can do the same. It may also make other contributions to promote international trade. Congressional leaders have stated that there is a majority in both houses in favor of reducing tariffs.</p>
<p>▲ National, Washington, 30th - The general sentiment in Washington tonight is that the Democratic government has found a way to revise the war debt foundation, which will satisfy both Congress and the debtors. It is anticipated that a war debt conference can be held within two weeks. Although this statement has not been confirmed by the White House, friends of the President and Secretary of State believe that informal talks between the State Department and the British and French ambassadors have produced some proposals that can lead to a formal conference. As for the revision of the war debt foundation, it is rumored that some important people are in favor of postponing the war debt due on June 15, and then adopting a plan with a total amount not exceeding twelve, funded by the issuance of public bonds.</p>

<p>Recalls Ambassador to Moscow to Hear Report Before Determining Attitude, May Resort to Excluding Russian Goods</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 30th - Regarding the arrest of British Vickers Company engineers in Moscow, a question was raised in the House of Commons today, to which Foreign Secretary Simon replied that the government had recalled the British Ambassador to Russia, Sir Esmond Ovey, to return to the country, and will determine a solution after his report. Political circles interpret this attitude as the government's intention to delay the matter by waiting for the British ambassador to return and report before deciding on British-Russian relations. It is recalled that Simon recently declared that a firm attitude must be adopted towards Soviet Russia, but Prime Minister MacDonald believed that a moderate attitude should be adopted. Therefore, it is not yet known what attitude the government will take. However, it will take some time for the British Ambassador to Russia to return and report. It is possible that the Soviet Russia may change its attitude during this time. It is generally believed that the inside story of this incident is a scene set by the Soviet Russian government's police department. In fact, the Soviet Russian government already knows that the British engineers are innocent, and within a few days, it hopes to obtain a solution that will satisfy Britain. In this way, the measures demanded by British cabinet members and most of the public opinion, which are inconsistent with British interests, can also be avoided.</p>
<p>▲ National, Moscow, 30th - The Russian government issued a communiqué today, announcing that the trial of the British engineers of the Vickers Company is scheduled to open on April 9. The defendants will be charged with espionage and other charges. According to criminal law, the most severe punishment is execution by firing squad. It is reported that on the 12th of this month, the Soviet Russian authorities arrested several Russians and six British engineers. Later, two British men were released, and three British men were allowed bail. The remaining one person was detained and not released. The British government and the British ambassador repeatedly negotiated to no avail. At the time of the publication of this communiqué, British Ambassador Sir Esmond Ovey and his family were being recalled to the country and departing for England. The diplomatic corps all went to the station to see him off, but the Russian Foreign Affairs Committee did not send a representative to see him off. Although the British government stated that Sir Ovey will return to his post, it is said in official circles that Sir Ovey may not return after returning to the country. Considering the current situation, the attitudes of the British and Russian governments are equally firm, and it seems that there may not be any change.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 31st - Regarding the statement made by Latham in the Australian Parliament that Britain would exclude Russian goods from entering the country, it is now learned that the British government has not yet made this decision. It is unlikely that there will be such a move before the cabinet meeting on Monday next week.</p>

<p>▲ Hualian, Tokyo, 31st - Prime Minister Saito is scheduled to depart from Tokyo Station at 10:15 tonight, first going to Ise to worship the ancestral shrine of the Emperor, and then visiting Prince Saionji's Seigyoso villa in Okitsu. Although Saito has expressed an extremely cold attitude towards the outside world regarding this trip, Japanese political figures observe that Prime Minister Saito's trip is of great importance to the future of Japanese political circles. It is generally speculated that even if the meeting between the two giants cannot immediately decide the advance or retreat of the Saito cabinet, it should have a clearer indication of the future development of Japanese political circles. Therefore, the attention of all parties has been focused on the words and actions of the two giants in recent days.</p>
<p>▲ Hualian, Tokyo, 30th - Prime Minister Saito met with Minister of Justice Koyama at the Prime Minister's official residence at 1 p.m. today. Minister of Justice Koyama contributed a lot of reference materials regarding Saito's visit to Prince Saionji. After a secret talk for an hour, he finally raised the issue of red judicial officers, asking Saito to convey the details to Elder Saionji and seek the Elder's understanding. It is expected that after Saito meets with Saionji, Koyama will prepare to resign voluntarily, because the issue of red judges has recently attracted more attention from the public, and he cannot but give a detailed explanation of the traditional responsibility.</p>

Considering the current situation in the country, even if the anti-Jewish movement is cancelled, it is still questionable whether the local National Socialist Party leaders and Stormtroopers will obey. The Jewish people's panic about the anti-Jewish movement can be seen in the market. Today, the market price plummeted due to the sale of stocks worth millions of marks.</p>
<p>▲ National, Munich, 30th - The Anti-Jewish Committee issued a declaration tonight, ordering all places to implement a boycott of Jewish shops and various businesses starting on Saturday. Even Jews who have converted to Christianity are included in the boycott. Pickets will be placed in front of each store to prevent customers from entering, but they must not be physically harmed or take actions such as smashing windows, resulting in material losses. All Jewish businesses will be marked with huge black and yellow signs. Boycotted stores must not open non-Jewish employees, and parades will be held, carrying flags with slogans, to persuade the public to boycott Jewish stores. Such slogans will be posted in all cities and towns on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>▲ National, Berlin, 30th - The National Socialist Party's boycott of Jewish people is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. on April 1. Large-scale parades will be held in major cities on Friday night, and there will be speeches on the street, stating that the boycott is a self-defense action against the international Jewish anti-German movement. The General Committee of the National Socialist Party Boycott issued a declaration to the people of Munich today, inviting them to hold a public demonstration in Konigsplatz on Friday night. Bavarian Interior Minister Wagner will attend the meeting and give a speech.</p>
<p>▲ National, Berlin, 31st - National Socialist groups have petitioned the authorities, stating that Jewish people only account for one percent of the German population, so the Jewish school children admitted to each school in the future must not exceed one percent.</p>
<p>▲ National, Frankfurt, 31st - The chief justice has asked Jewish judges to resign voluntarily. Those who refuse to do so will not be allowed to enter the court again. The number of Jewish lawyers in the Frankfurt court will be determined by comparing the total population of Germans and Jewish people. The Jewish population is only slightly less than one percent of the German population.</p>

<p>▲ National, Washington, 30th - Today, the U.S. Senate adopted the amended clauses of the House's unemployment relief bill, and finally passed the bill, which was sent to the White House for promulgation and implementation. According to the provisions of the bill, the government may employ 250,000 people to engage in afforestation and other work. At this time, employment offices will be established in towns near afforestation areas and major cities across the country. In addition to the public bearing the transportation costs of the recruited workers, clothing will be provided when necessary. If the required funds are insufficient, the President may consider transferring funds from other federal engineering projects that have been passed by Congress. The reason why this unemployment relief plan focuses on afforestation is that it does not require huge equipment costs. According to what was heard today, worker registration will begin at this time, and it is expected that a majority of workers will start working within three weeks. It is expected that by June 1, 250,000 unemployed people will have jobs.</p>

<p>▲ Havas, Washington, 31st - It is said that opposition to Roosevelt in Congress is about to intensify. Many senators are dissatisfied with Roosevelt's use of special powers to force Congress to pass some important laws without giving them time for discussion.

<h3 id="e76">The Tragedy of American Farmers (Continued) <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>New York Correspondence</p>
<p>"Debt"</p>
<p>In many places, the interest on farmers' debts is even higher than taxes. At present, American farmers have more than nine trillion gold dollars in real estate mortgage loans alone, and other various debts amount to about three trillion gold dollars. In this way, the debts of American farmers total as much as twelve trillion to thirteen trillion gold dollars. There are more than six million farm households in the United States, so each household has an average of two thousand gold dollars in debt. The annual interest on mortgage loans alone amounts to six hundred and seventy-one million gold dollars. One-tenth of the farm households owe as much as three-quarters of all their property, and one-fifth of the farm households owe half of their property. All of these are calculated based on the price on the land contract. In fact, as a result of farmer bankruptcies, land prices have fallen even further. According to the Hoover Commission report, in the past ten years, the price of farmland in the United States has fallen by a total of two trillion gold dollars. The property of countless farm households, when converted, is not enough to repay the debt. More than two-thirds of these debts are held by banks and insurance companies. Therefore, a question naturally arises: Who is the true owner of the farmland, the farm households who have no hope of repaying the debt, or the banks that control them? The property of thousands of farmers who are unable to repay their debts has been confiscated and auctioned by banks.</p>
<p>In the past decade or so, the rapid development of tenant farmers in the United States is also due to this. After farmers mortgage their own property, they become tenant farmers. Fifty years ago, when virgin land in the United States was about to be occupied, tenant farmers accounted for only a quarter of all farm households. Now it is almost half (42%). American farmers pay more than seven hundred million gold dollars in rent each year, which is even more than the interest on debt or taxes. With the current plummeting prices of agricultural products, the suffering of American tenant farmers is difficult to describe in words.</p>
<p>Now most farmers' income is not even half of the wages of hired farm workers in the past. In the first year of the economic panic, about one-third of the farm households sought side jobs to supplement their household income. Furthermore, most of the farmland freely abandoned by farmers is barren and becomes government land. This kind of government land, which was first seen in American history, is not only decreasing but also increasing day by day. In any case, the fact is that American farmers are gradually no longer the true owners of their own property. Capitalism in the era of panic either drives farmers off their land or turns them into lifelong debtors, unfree tenant farmers, who are even worse than hired farm workers.</p>
<p>"Tractors Have Become Weapons That Impoverish Farmers" One of the characteristics of capitalism is that the progress of technology and the application of new agricultural machinery have a great relationship in this mass bankruptcy of farmers. The use of tractors and combines in the United States has even more forcefully pushed farmers into the abyss. Machinery increases production, which in turn promotes the fall in prices. The past decade in the United States can be regarded as an era of great revolution in agricultural technology. The number of tractors used in agriculture reached 900,000. From 1922 to 1926 alone, this increased production by more than a quarter, while the planting area did not increase. The result was simply a sharp drop in prices and the bankruptcy of small farmers.</p>
<p>At the same time, the increase in productivity has created surplus laborers. In the vast plains of the United States, a worker can manage about 300 acres of planting area using new machinery. Since there is nowhere to accommodate the surplus population, the result is that the American countryside is piled up with a large number of idlers who have nothing to do, which only intensifies the competition in the labor market. In 1917, there were a total of 35,000 wheat-growing farm households in Montana. Now there are only 14,000 households. Where have the 21,000 farm households in that state who have been displaced by machinery gone? How do they live?</p>
<p>The application of tractors and combines in the United States has also had another result: tractors have bankrupted middle farmers and poor farmers, and promoted the rapid growth of rich farmers and large capitalist agriculture. Even the Hoover Commission had to say, "The number of middle farmers is decreasing day by day." According to the 1930 census statistics, between 1920 and 1930, only the number of middle farmer lands decreased. On the contrary, the number of poor small farm households (those with less than 19 acres) and large farm households (those with more than 500 acres) both increased greatly. For example, the land owned by farm households with 1,000 to 5,000 acres of land increased from 106 million to 127 million acres, an increase of 20%. The land owned by farm households with more than 5 acres of land increased from 113 million to 148 million acres, an increase of about one-third. Therefore, in countries with capitalist panic, the result of the use of tractors is like this: poor small farm households are increasingly divided, middle farm households go bankrupt, and rich farmers increase day by day. This situation is even more obvious in pure wheat-growing areas. For example, in the western states where tractors are most popular, the number of farm household lands with more than 1,000 acres has increased by more than half.</p>
<p>"Acreage Reduction Movement"</p>
<p>Naturally, in this tragic situation, farmers cannot but seek other ways to survive. Anti-tax and anti-debt movements, as well as preventing banks or government agencies from auctioning agricultural products, are often heard of. In some places, farmers openly gather crowds to kill judges, inspectors, and court officials who supervise auctions. In some places, thousands of farmers gather on their own to auction off land and agricultural implements at extremely low prices, not allowing others to participate. A cow or horse is sold for only a dime or five cents. The land or agricultural tools sold in this way can still be used by the original owner.</p>
<p>This primitive movement first occurred in the western states and is now spreading to many states and gradually entering the eastern states. In fact, many states have formed an "illegal" situation, and the law and its supervisors have lost their effectiveness. "In a sense," said the editor of the Evening Post, "this is a true peaceful revolution against the current order, the purpose of which is to eliminate heavy burdens." When the House of Representatives met on February 3, New York State Representative Galji said that not only a "peaceful" revolution was possible, but also compared the farmers' actions to the Boston Riot when the American Revolutionary War broke out.</p>
<p>Naturally, the American authorities have also tried to ease the situation. Some large banks and insurance companies have voluntarily announced a temporary suspension of auctions. Senator Hall proposed a two-year moratorium on national debt payments. Some advocated finding ways to raise agricultural product prices, and some even advocated using inflationary policies to save the situation. The most famous of these plans is the so-called acreage reduction bill passed by the House, which stipulates that the difference between the current market price and the pre-war price will be compensated to farmers by the state establishing a special tax. However, farmers must leave most of their cultivated land barren in order to reduce production and increase prices. This is a funny thing.</p>
<p>However, these American plans will either provoke resistance from the banking industry and trusts, or they are only temporary attempts to survive. The "acreage reduction" bill has already been buried. All of these plans, at best, can only give temporary and weak comfort to the extremely poor farmers. The terrible agricultural panic is a product of capitalist development and panic, and can only be eliminated with its demise. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Cold Pass Frontline Position Inspection Record <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Cold Pass Once Lost, Recovered by Shang Zhen's Troops</p>
<p>Enemy Suffered Losses and Retreated Over Twenty Li Beyond the Pass</p>
<p>Shang Army's Frontline Defensive Works Extremely Solid</p>
<p>But Military Supplies and Various Food Provisions Severely Lacking</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch: Nowadays, any armed comrades who truly are willing to sacrifice and vow to resist Japan are easily embraced by the fervent support of the national populace. It's not necessary to mention the past Nineteenth Route Army. Recently, Song Zheyuan's troops and Guan Linzheng's division fought bloody battles against Japan at Xifengkou and Gubeikou, both receiving unanimous support from the national populace. However, Division Commander Guan was isolated and without assistance, suffering too many casualties, so Gubeikou remains in enemy hands to this day. Cold Pass was once lost, but was recovered by Shang Zhen's dispatch of Huang Guanghua's division, a truly great achievement. At that time, Zhang Xueliang had not yet resigned, and concealing the loss of territory, he secretly did not make it public, thus the achievement of Shang's troops in recovering Cold Pass was also buried. To this day, Shang's troops still resist the enemy twenty li outside of Cold Pass, and their calm and steady spirit is also worthy of our praise. The reporter went to the front lines of eastern Luan on the 27th to inspect, and it happened that Shao Yuanchong and Lu Dangping were also going to eastern Luan, so we traveled together. At 11:30 a.m. that morning, we departed from the East Station on the third express train. At 2:00 p.m., we arrived in Tangshan and changed to the seventh slow train to Kaiping, then went to the headquarters of the 囗th Army Corps to visit Commander Shang. According to Shang, the loss of Chengde had a great impact on military affairs. The troops outside the Great Wall retreated without a fight. The enemy's Nakamura Brigade and Miyama Detachment (belonging to the 10th Division of the Jilu Army), about two thousand men, traveled in over a hundred vehicles including tanks, armored cars, and heavy trucks, departing from Lingnan. With tanks leading the way, they charged wildly, as if entering an uninhabited land. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, the Miyama Detachment occupied Cold Pass. Our army was ordered to counterattack on the 5th, immediately sending Division Commander Huang Guanghua to lead his troops, advancing through the night, recovering Cold Pass on the 6th, and taking advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy over thirty li beyond the pass, occupying the two positions of Xiaojiayingzi and Madaogou. Miyama then led his troops to attack Xifengkou and Gubeikou. Miyama boasted that he was invincible, but then led his troops to attack Cold Pass again. We immediately met them head-on with a fierce attack, and also used night raids. The enemy suffered heavy losses. As the terrain of Xiaojiayingzi is low-lying, our army had to abandon it. We defended Madaogou on the front. The enemy was in Xiaojiayingzi, eight li away. Our left flank defended the Shanshen Temple and Yingtaoyuanzi, and our right flank defended Gaoligou and Badaohe. If the enemy attacked our front, our left and right flanks would encircle the enemy. If the enemy attacked our left and right flanks, our front would attack. If the enemy attacked all three routes at once, a large force would be required, but the terrain of Xiaojiayingzi is concave, and a large force cannot be deployed. Therefore, in recent days, the enemy has not dared to launch a formal attack, only relying on artillery and aircraft to harass us daily. Enemy aircraft harass us four times a day, four aircraft each time, from after 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. The first time is a reconnaissance plane, which does not drop bombs. The second, third, and fourth times are bombers, each plane dropping over ten bombs, about fifty or sixty bombs in total. The large and small villages inside and outside of Cold Pass were bombed very badly. For the first day or two, the people did not understand the danger. Seeing enemy planes fly over, they came out of their homes to look up. The enemy planes mistakenly thought they were troops, and dropped bombs, causing many civilian casualties. Afterwards, they all fled. When the planes dropped bombs and the artillery bombarded, our army's telegraph lines were often blown up. Even if they were not blown up, it was impossible to talk due to the continuous bombing sounds. At this time, the frontline radio station also lost its normal function because the air was shaken by the loud noises, and could not transmit messages. On the 25th and 26th, there were strong winds and rain, and the military telegraph lines were blown down. It was repaired this evening (the 27th). At that time, Lu Dangping told Shang that the Beijing People's Self-Defense Guidance Committee had achieved great results in raising funds, having collected over one million yuan, but they did not know what the front lines needed. Shang replied that shoes, socks, broadswords, stretcher beds, cars, and gasoline were all extremely needed. Lu Kun promised to return to Beijing to report to the Self-Defense Guidance Committee to purchase them. Then, we studied the time to go to the front lines, deciding to depart that night, arrive before dawn, and return at sunrise, as it would be dangerous after that time. Kaiping has East-West and North-South main streets. Business is depressed. There are city towers but no city walls. The entire city has about three or four thousand households. Food prices are even higher than in Tianjin. The discipline of Shang's army is very good, and the people praise it. When asked about the discipline of the Northeast Army, they shook their heads and sighed slightly. At 8:00 p.m. that evening, the reporter followed Shang Zhen, Shao Yuanchong, and Lu Dangping onto a special train. At 10:00 p.m., we arrived in Luanzhou, and immediately changed to a car to depart. From Luanzhou to Qian'an is ninety li, from Qian'an to Jianchangying is forty li, and from Jianchangying to Cold Pass is eight li. This road for cars was hastily repaired by Shang Zhen sending troops temporarily. Because it was crushed by heavy transport vehicles, it was rough and uneven. The car traveled bumpily, fearing it would overturn. At 1:30 a.m. on the 28th, we arrived in Qian'an, passing through the city. At 2:30 a.m., we arrived near Jianchangying's 囗囗囗. Because Jianchangying was destroyed by enemy aircraft, it was no longer habitable. The so-called 囗囗囗 was only a few dilapidated earth houses, which were temporarily found by Division Commanders Huang Guanghua and Gao Hongwen as a reception station. Charcoal was burned indoors to ward off the cold. Shang Zhen, knowing that there was no food on the front lines, brought some snacks and cigarettes, distributing them to everyone. Shang asked if thin porridge had been prepared. Division Commander Huang hesitated and replied, "There is no rice or millet, so it was not prepared." This one sentence already showed the suffering of the soldiers on the front lines. Division Commander Huang called his attendants to bring a few plates of crackers. Looking closely, they were infested with worms, but the soldiers regarded them as treasures. Huang and Gao both expressed that all the soldiers were willing to sacrifice themselves for the country and vowed to kill the enemy. Huang told the reporter that the enemy had over twenty artillery pieces, dozens of mortars, and many light and heavy machine guns. The battle on the 24th was the most fierce. The enemy launched a joint land and air attack with all their strength. The Madaogou position was lost and regained twice. Finally, our special service battalion commander Zhang Kexun led his troops to Xiaojiayingzi, approaching the enemy's trenches. He first threw hand grenades, but unexpectedly, the grenades were old and damp, and most did not explode. Otherwise, Miyama would have been completely annihilated. But because the grenades did not explode, they used broadswords to slash. Our Battalion Commander Zhang and Company Commander Meng ZhanKui, and Platoon Leader Ma Dengying charged into the enemy's machine gun positions and died heroically at the same time. From this battle, the enemy's courage has been chilled, and they dare not attack again, only using aircraft and artillery to harass us every day. Our soldiers are used to it and no longer fear it. We have anti-aircraft machine guns and have damaged an enemy plane. The enemy is very afraid and stays above two or three thousand meters, not daring to fly low, so the damage is minimal. I observe the enemy planes with binoculars every day. They are all old-fashioned biplanes, and the piloting skills are not very refined, so they cannot fly at night. Yesterday morning (the 27th), for the first time, enemy planes were found to be single-wing Junkers planes, equipped with machine guns. Each bomb weighed about two hundred pounds and created a pit over ten feet deep when it hit the ground. Our troops all have shelters, so there are few casualties. All work is done at night. Yesterday, enemy planes dropped bombs in Tangzhangzi, and one of our engineers repairing the telegraph lines was injured. Then, I spoke with Commander Shang. Shang said that supplies are lacking on the front lines because transportation is inconvenient and replenishment is difficult. Horse feed is especially lacking. Qian'an County has six districts. Song Zheyuan's troops occupy three districts. Our army's battlefield occupies one district. This battlefield district is all mountains, with no grass on the mountains, mostly planted with walnuts and chestnuts. Our army's reserve troops occupy one district, leaving one district, which is not enough to maintain the people's food supply, so how can it supply military use? Now, each division only has twenty stretcher beds. If there is a fierce battle, it will not be enough. I hope the rear will replenish them. The central government stipulates that for each officer killed in action, they are allowed to buy a coffin worth fifteen yuan, and for each soldier, they are allowed to buy a coffin worth twelve yuan. I feel very uneasy about this, and have issued orders to my subordinates that each lieutenant officer killed in action is allowed to purchase a coffin worth thirty yuan, and each soldier is allowed to purchase a coffin worth fifteen yuan. Officers above the rank of colonel will have special preferential treatment. The funds required will be advanced by me personally to comfort the heroic souls. At 3:30, all the cars departed again. Division Commander Huang also sent dozens of guards to go five minutes ahead to provide security. The reporter arrived at Cold Pass at 4:00. Getting out of the car, we immediately walked out of the pass. The moon was dark, the wind was mournful, and there was no sound of chickens or dogs, fully displaying the solemn scene of the battlefield. The lights in the mountains were dim, which I was told was the soldiers' work to protect against the cold. Then, we strode urgently on the sand. Meditating that in the South, the peach blossoms were red, the willows were green, the flowers were fragrant, and the birds were singing, while here it was still in an icy world with a biting north wind. On the way, we met a stretcher team carrying a wounded soldier. Shang immediately stepped forward to express his condolences, learning that he was an engineer who had been wounded by enemy bombing in Tangzhangzi that morning. After traveling six or seven li, we inspected several defensive works. As the east was just beginning to brighten, the rumbling of enemy artillery reached our ears. Everyone did not want to go forward, but Shang remained calm, and led us up the mountain to view the bunkers and trenches, as well as the machine gun positions, which were all new fortifications after the European War. Because the mountain's steep slopes made the sand very slippery, two people lost their footing and fell. At this time, we had just reached the mountainside, and Shang still wanted to lead us to see the artillery positions on the top of the mountain, but everyone sighed at the mountain and returned in disappointment. At 6:00, we returned to Cold Pass. Someone suggested climbing to the top of Cold Pass to see the majestic appearance of the Great Wall, but because although the mountain was not high, it would take three hours to go up and down, and we were afraid that the enemy planes would arrive before we reached the top, so we gave up. Under the pass, there were still a few dilapidated houses. Among them, there were residents, who were opening the door to fetch water, without any panic or anxiety. This was strange indeed. In a mountain cave half a li outside the pass, there was a dead body, a soldier of the Northeast Army who had been killed by enemy fire during the retreat. Division Commander Huang immediately ordered it to be buried as soon as possible. Then, we met one or two hundred civilians, carrying hoes and spades, standing on the side of the road, all smiling bitterly. According to Division Commander Huang, the requisitioned civilians did not receive wages. Fortunately, the villagers still knew how to love their country, working at sunrise and resting at sunset, without any complaints. The reporter expressed his great admiration for the solid and meticulous defensive works, and believed that if Zhaoyang, Kailu, and other places had these works, Rehe would not have easily fallen into enemy hands. Shang laughed and said, "Having good works also requires good soldiers. Otherwise, if they run away as soon as they see the enemy, even if there are good works, they will be given to the enemy." At 6:30, we boarded the car and left Cold Pass. At 9:00, we arrived at 囗zhou and immediately boarded the special train. At 11:00, we arrived in Kaiping. Shang insisted on inviting us to get off the car for lunch. After lunch, he gathered over a hundred generals and officers and invited Shao to give a speech. At 3:30 p.m., Shang prepared a special car to send us to the station to say goodbye. At 7:00 p.m., we arrived in Tianjin, already exhausted. (March 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Great Fire at Shenxin Cotton Mill in Hankou <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Losses Estimated at Approximately Two Million Yuan, Over Four Thousand Workers Unemployed</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Shenxin Cotton Mill in Zongguan, Qiaokou, in this city, is the largest enterprise organization independently run by Chinese people, with a capital of approximately three million yuan, divided into three sections: spinning, weaving, and warehousing, employing over four thousand male and female workers. On the 29th, because all the workers participated in the memorial meeting for the seventy-two martyrs, they were given a day off, leaving only one foreman and four workers to take care of the factory. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out. Due to the small number of people, it was difficult to extinguish, and it became a major disaster. Buildings and machinery were reduced to ashes. Initially, the foreman Lu A'gen and workers Zhang Yougen, Zhang Jiyuan, Hu Xingjia, and Lu Qiuquan, a total of five people, were still organizing the earth axis in the fine yarn room after all the workers left the factory. At 4:00 p.m., they had not yet finished. At 4:30 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out under the earth axis, and the fire was very fierce. Lu and the others immediately went outside to call for help. Because the other workers had all been given a holiday, they could not be gathered in time, causing the fire to become more intense. Fire brigades from various places rushed to the scene, but were unable to extinguish the fire. It continued to burn until 1:00 a.m. this morning (30th), when it was finally extinguished. All the steel wire room, coarse yarn room, fine yarn room, reeling room, and carding room, over four hundred and eighty buildings, were all reduced to scorched earth. Only the opening room and the cloth factory were not burned. After investigation, the losses are estimated at over two million yuan, accounting for seven-tenths of the total capital. It will be difficult to resume work in a short period of time. The four thousand workers who rely on it for food and clothing have suddenly become unemployed. On the 30th, the workers elected representatives to contact the factory and the authorities, requesting relief. The city party headquarters and the municipal government have already discussed it once and decided to actively find ways to maintain it. The garrison command and the Public Security Bureau have sent police to temporarily station at the fire scene to maintain order. The factory manager, Li Guowei, also telegraphed the Shanghai factory to report the details of the negligence. It was found that the factory had previously insured for 1,298,900 taels of fire insurance, which expired on the 15th of this month, and then insured for another 1,000,000 taels, which had not yet been registered with the local police station, before the fire broke out. However, since the people boycotted inferior goods since last year, the factory's business has been quite prosperous. The true cause of the fire is still unknown. The nine people who discovered the fire, including Lu A'gen, were sent to the Public Security Bureau on the 30th to await interrogation.</p>
<p>In Zongguan, Qiaokou, in addition to the Shenxin Cotton Mill, there is also the Taian Cotton Mill run by the Japanese. Because cotton merchants do not sell raw materials and the cotton mill does not purchase products, it announced the suspension of work on the 28th. The garrison command, deeply concerned that the factory originally employed many Chinese workers and that labor-capital negotiations might occur between the unemployed workers and the factory, leading to disputes, ordered the First District Command, the Hankou Public Security Bureau, and the investigation department of the garrison command to pay close attention and strictly protect it. If there are unresolved problems between labor and capital, the workers should be advised to abide by the main points of the previously promulgated proclamation, request the competent authorities to negotiate or provide relief on their behalf, and absolutely not to directly negotiate. The workers should also be informed that they must not stay in the factory or make unreasonable disturbances, otherwise they will be arrested immediately. (March 30th)</p>

<p>The Zhenjiang National Salvation Association recently discovered several pieces of suspected enemy goods with flower labels transferred by Yuanda Cloth Store and immediately detained them. However, these cloths were all produced by Shanghai Lunchang Dyeing and Weaving Company. Afterwards, the merchant reported to the British Consul and requested that they be returned. The British Consul sent a letter to the Zhenjiang County Government for investigation. It is now reported that the Zhenjiang County Government has replied according to the letter from the Provincial Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, stating that the raw materials of the goods are similar to enemy goods, and there is a fear that they may be mixed with counterfeit goods in an attempt to profit. After consultation, it was decided to report to the province to consult the Ministry to send personnel to thoroughly investigate whether the products of the company are goods with changed labels. Before proof is obtained, they will be temporarily withheld.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Li Liejun Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Li Discusses in Detail the Trip to Shanxi and Chahar to Meet Yan and Feng</p>
<p>Issues a Written Statement Describing the Opening of Political Power</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Central Committee Member Li Liejun previously left Shanghai to go north to inspect the war situation, and on behalf of Chairman Chiang, went to Shanxi and Chahar to meet with Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang to discuss major military plans for resisting Japan. He returned south from Ping on the previous day, advocating the opening of political power during the national crisis. At 5:50 p.m. yesterday, Li returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the Nanjing-Shanghai train, accompanied by his private secretary Zhang Migong. In addition to issuing a face-to-face statement on the opening of political power, Li also spoke in detail with reporters about his trip to meet Yan and Feng.</p>
<p>(Process of Meeting Feng and Yan) After being summoned to Nanjing, I (Li Liejun refers to himself below) immediately studied with the Central Committee comrades the strategies to save the country from danger. The comrades were all able to discuss with sincerity, which is a good phenomenon. Later, as Rehe was in danger, I was extremely concerned and still decided to go north. Unfortunately, on the way, I heard the news of the fall of Chengde, and my heart was burned. I felt even more anxious, ashamed that I had no single soldier available to fight against the violent Japanese on the front lines. I met with Mr. Yan Baichuan several times in Taiyuan. Mr. Yan's attitude towards resisting Japan was extremely resolute, and he said that the one hundred thousand brave soldiers of Shanxi must stand on the front line of resisting Japan. His troops had all been mobilized and sent to the Chahar border. Some people often say that the Shanxi army is weak, but this is not the case. For example, the troops of Shang Zhen, who recently repeatedly defeated the violent Japanese at Lengkou, are indeed from the Shanxi army. Other troops, such as those of Fu Zuoyi, Li Fuying, and Yang Aiyuan, are all very reliable. If the Japanese army invades the west, they will definitely be given a major blow. Later, I took a car from Taiyuan to Zhangjiakou to meet the commoner Feng Huanzhang. Mr. Feng's opinion was as it was in the past. Regarding the resistance against Japan, Mr. Feng's position is active and tough, and he absolutely does not advocate holding on to a fixed position. As for the news repeatedly reported in the newspapers that he had a message for Nanjing, Mr. Feng repeatedly stated that resistance against Japan must be on the front lines, and one must truly fight and kill the enemy. It is said that he does not want to hide in the rear to avoid disaster. The Central Committee is still considering the 　Chen of Feng. Now the Japanese army also intends to invade Zhangjiakou, and Mr. Feng will soon be in the line of fire.</p>
<p>(Suggestion to Open Political Power) Given that the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, if the people of the whole country do not unite, the country will certainly perish. Therefore, I suggested opening political power, and I repeatedly talked about this with Chairman Chiang in Baoding. Mr. Chiang also deeply realized the mistakes of the past, so after I arrived in Nanjing, I formally submitted it to the Central Political Council. Mr. Wang and the comrades all agreed with this proposal, and it was decided to convene a National People's Congress on July 1 to truly entrust the central government to the people. At the same time, talent from all over the country will be gathered to manage the central government. If there is internal unity, it will be easier to resist foreign insults.</p>
<p>(Regarding the Opening of Political Power) Regarding the opening of political power, Li issued a written statement stating that this time the Central Committee has determined the steps for opening political power in order to realize the Three Principles of the People. Although it is due to the demands of the times, very few members of the Kuomintang actually advocate dictatorship. This can be clearly understood by observing the course of the meeting and the statements made by Mr. Wang. However, in order to express the spirit, value, and sincerity of the resolutions to the world, the future conduct should be even more thorough. As Mr. Chiang said, it must be thoroughly opened. Upon returning to Shanghai, I plan to introduce the actual situation of the Central Committee's resistance against Japan and the sincerity of political reforms to society, hoping that the people of the country will know the truth and rise up in time.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yang Dezhao Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yang Dezhao, representing Chen Jitang, accompanied by his wife, and Li Haoju and his wife, the secretaries of Wang Jingwei, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the President Hoover yesterday morning at 8:00. A reporter from New Voice Agency met with him on the ship. Yang said that after meeting Chairman Chiang in Shanghai, he would go to Nanjing. The Guangdong anti-Japanese army will depart north as soon as they have met the Fujian troops. The following is a record of Yang's remarks:</p>
<p>Awaiting Chiang's Meeting: Yang said that I originally intended to take the Canadian Empress ship to Shanghai, but later changed to the President Hoover due to circumstances. After arriving in Shanghai, I plan to first visit Vice President Song to inquire about the exact date of Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shanghai. After awaiting Chiang's visit in Shanghai and reporting everything, I will go to Nanjing to visit President Wang.</p>
<p>Suppressing Bandits Militarily: After Chairman Chiang went north to resist Japan, the military affairs of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi have not stopped and are still actively progressing. Chairman Chiang's intention was to ask Mr. Chen Bonan to take on the task, but Mr. Chen could not take full responsibility due to the heavy burden of affairs in Guangdong. Yu Hanmou is only undertaking a part of the work. The title has not been decided and will only be known after meeting Chiang and Wang.</p>
<p>About to Set Out: The Guangdong side will send ○○ regiment to undertake the work of suppressing the Communists. Guangdong could have set out earlier, but the organization of the logistics team was lacking, and transportation required recruiting laborers. Because it was the spring plowing season, it was not easy to recruit them, so we had to recruit them from Hunan and Guangxi provinces. As soon as it is completed, they can be mobilized and set out within one or two days. In the future, approximately three-tenths of the resident troops will be dispatched first, and then gradually up to eight-tenths. As for Cai Tingkai, the commander of the Nineteenth Army, he has also decided to send troops to assist Rehe.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties: The expenses for suppressing the bandits are relatively difficult. Previously, Guangdong's expenses were mostly obtained from donations from overseas Chinese, but recently, due to the failure of overseas Chinese businesses, the income has decreased by more than one million yuan each year. Export trade is also poor, resulting in a strange financial situation. Therefore, Guangdong's military expenses are only 50%. If the expenses for suppressing the bandits are truly not available this time, we can only ask the Central Committee for assistance, but this is not a blackmailing act, but out of necessity.</p>
<p>Assisting Rehe and Resisting Japan: As for Guangdong's dispatch of troops to assist Rehe and resist Japan, it is about to be mobilized. There are no provisions for any titles such as the National Salvation Army. The original independent Fourth Division number will still be used. After meeting with the Nineteenth Route Army troops from Fujian and arriving at a suitable location, they can set out.</p>
<p>Consistent Diplomacy: As for the Southwest's foreign policy position, it is naturally consistent with the Central Committee's, namely, resisting Japan and suppressing the Communists. Without resisting Japan, there is no diplomacy to speak of. It is only possible to conduct diplomacy after being able to resist Japan. This is the same as what Mr. Wang Jingwei said. As for myself, I did not meet Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong, so Mr. Hu did not give me a letter to bring. Only Mr. Chen Bonan had a letter to convey to Chairman Chiang, but this is a common occurrence. The content is nothing more than the above, hoping to resist Japan and suppress bandits. After the bandits are suppressed, we can resist Japan. There is a connection between suppressing the Communists and resisting Japan. As for a compromise diplomacy, it is certainly not something we dare to support. Not only does Mr. Chen personally hold this view, but generally all armed comrades also share the same view.</p>

<p>丨丨For the purpose of training pilot talent丨丨</p>
<p>Recently, the call for national salvation through aviation has been extremely high. People in Shanghai have elected Mayor Wu Tiecheng as the general leader of the solicitation team and have re-appointed well-known figures from all walks of life and those enthusiastic about national salvation as team leaders. Jian Yuqie, the general manager of Nanyang Company, is one of the solicitation team leaders. Recently, it has been heard that he plans to donate 100,000 yuan in the company's name for the purpose of training aircraft pilots. It is noted that the company has donated a large amount of money to social charities over the years. This time, it has donated another 100,000 yuan for national salvation through aviation, which is truly commendable for its righteousness and courage. The letter to Mayor Wu is attached below.</p>
<p>"Respected Director Wu Tiecheng,</p>
<p>I received your letter of the 12th of this month, entrusting Yuqie as the leader of the Shanghai Solicitation Team of the Chinese Aviation Association. I am aware of my limited abilities and fear that I will not be able to fulfill the task. However, my patriotic heart dares not lag behind others. Moreover, I am deeply moved by your sincere trust and encouragement. I will strive to make achievements. I intend to donate 100,000 yuan in the name of our company for the purpose of training aviation talent. This has been telegraphed to the board of directors in Hong Kong for approval. As for the company's staff and workers, they are still free to make their own donations at any time. I believe that purchasing aviation fighter planes to meet the national crisis is the most urgent plan at present. However, training this kind of pilot talent is also a top priority. The United Kingdom currently has 1,062 aviation fighter planes and 10,352 incumbent officers and soldiers proficient in piloting. France has 1,730 aviation fighter planes and 36,800 incumbent officers and soldiers proficient in piloting. Italy has 1,507 aviation fighter planes and 22,193 incumbent officers and soldiers proficient in piloting. Japan has 838 aviation fighter planes and 3,500 incumbent officers and soldiers proficient in piloting. Other countries are too numerous to mention. In general, the strength of air combat power depends on both the number of aircraft and the number of personnel. In addition to manufacturing aviation fighter planes, they pay special attention to training pilot talent. All kinds of equipment are made as precise as possible, even at great expense. Therefore, they can produce a steady stream of talent to defend the country. Looking back at our country, the equipment for this kind of training is not common, so this kind of talent cannot emerge continuously. In this time of national crisis, I believe that we should raise funds to purchase aircraft and also pay attention to training pilot talent in order to be of help. I hereby submit a report on the progress of the solicitation, hoping that you will review it. Please stipulate the method of distribution for the 100,000 yuan donated by our company, and inform us of how to train this kind of pilot talent at any time. Our company will save the money and wait. I respectfully reply and wish you good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Jian Yuqie, March 29, 1933"</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the Aviation Association office in Ba Xian Qiao received donations, including 5 yuan saved from snacks by Gui Caixia, Bi Chuhang, Yu Xiufang, Jiang Chunxue, Zhu Peiyun, Xu Zongquan, Cai Ronghua, Jian Huizhu, Ren Suying, Shi Guoquan, Ma Yiyu, Wang Ruiying, Wang Botao, Chen Fengzhen, Jiang Ronghe, Jiang Nianzu, Zhang Yueming, and other fifth and sixth grade students of Shangzhi Elementary School to help national salvation through aviation. In addition, all the workers of the Shanghai Cement Company donated their double wages issued on the Anniversary of the Passing of the Premier, totaling 141 yuan and 83 cents. Yuhuatang donated 8 jiao. All the students of the private Taihe Elementary School on Huade Road, Qiqihar Road, donated 10 yuan, 1 jiao and 6 cents to help build the "Children's Plane." It is noted that all the workers of the Er Miaotang Yiji Ink Workshop donated 6 yuan, 1 jiao and 7 cents of their double wages on the Anniversary of the Passing of the Premier on March 12. The Keqin Cloth Factory donated 52 yuan and 4 jiao of share funds to aviation.

A total of 2,000 yuan from the male workers and 1,400 yuan from the female workers have been received, totaling 3,400 yuan. The money was sent to the Shanghai Bank for collection by the union yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Unification of Traffic Management on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Based on the principle of benefiting merchants and increasing transportation, the Ministry of Railways ordered the railway bureau to draft a plan for submission.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways originally planned to convert all passenger and freight cars on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways into through trains to facilitate travel. The principle has been decided. Yesterday, the management bureaus of the two railways were ordered to quickly draft a unified traffic management method for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways in order to set a date for implementation. The original order from the Xinsheng News Agency's Beijing correspondent is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"It is found that although the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways nominally belong to the same bureau, the traffic management of the two railways is still independent. Passenger and freight trains have not eliminated regional barriers and are not connected to each other. The distribution of locomotives has not been planned as a whole to adjust surpluses and deficits. Outwardly, passengers and merchants feel inconvenienced. Inwardly, transportation efficiency will inevitably be sharply reduced. The intangible losses in personnel expenses and work efficiency are even greater. This is not the way to railway economics and loses the purpose of merging the two railways. The two railways are required to divide the accounting system due to foreign debt relations. However, the accounting separation is to calculate the profits and losses of each business, while the traffic unification is to seek the economic benefits of transportation for each other, which can be carried out simultaneously without contradiction. Now, the capital's ferry is about to open to traffic, and the responsible goods of each road have also implemented joint transportation. In order to increase the transportation of the two roads and develop the business of the two roads, it is necessary to quickly seek to unify the traffic management of the two roads. For this reason, the bureau is ordered to quickly draft a unified traffic management method for the two roads based on the principle of facilitating passengers and merchants on the two roads and increasing transportation efficiency internally, and submit it for verification."</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency's Beijing correspondent, the Ministry of Railways expects that the through traffic of all passenger and freight cars on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways will be fully implemented by June 1 at the latest in order to connect the Jinpu Ferry after the Yangtze River is installed.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Liao Chengzhi and Others Transferred to Shanghai Public Security Bureau <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Lawyers showed their eloquence in court. The defendants' opposition to the transfer was invalid.</p>
<p>Liao Chengzhi, the son of Central Committee member He Xiangning, has recently been identified by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau as having communist suspicions. Director Wen Hongen specially sent Inspector Lu Keqin to the Old Zha Gate Patrol Room of the Public Concession on the afternoon of March 28 to request assistance in the arrest. The chief dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to house number 9, Wufu Lane, Shanxi Road, to arrest Liao Chengzhi and two other Min people, Luo Dengxian, and Yu Wenhua from Henan, who were also suspected of being communists. The next morning, they were transferred to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for interrogation. They were all ordered to be detained pending further interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued trial. Because of her concern for her son, He Xiangning's old illness relapsed and she was bedridden at her residence and unable to attend court. However, many of her relatives and friends went to the first court of the Second Branch of the High Court to listen to the trial after 2 pm. In addition, the ladies and gentlemen who came to court to listen were as numerous as clouds, causing the spacious courtroom to suddenly</p>
<p>experienced overcrowding. Those who arrived later had no place to stand. The lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Ma Chang, who were appointed by He Xiangning to defend her son, and Cai Xiaobai, the defense lawyer for Luo and Yu, also appeared in court on time. At 2:30, Criminal Court President Yu Ye, Judges Zhao Zhengdong and Zhou Han, Prosecutor Zhang Junqing, and the clerk took their seats. First, several other appeal cases were announced. At 2:50, Liao Chengzhi, Luo Dengxian, and Yu Wenhua were summoned to begin the trial. The bailiffs brought Yu Wenhua, who was in the waiting room, along with Liao Chengzhi and Luo Dengxian, who were sitting in the corner of the court, into the defendant's box. The judge first ordered Gan Jingxian, the lawyer of the patrol room, to report on the progress of the investigation during the adjournment. According to lawyer Gan, the address of the third defendant, Liao Chengzhi, has not yet been verified. When questioning the first defendant, Luo Dengxian, he confessed that he met Liao Chengzhi through Yu Wenhua's introduction. According to the second landlord of No. 9 Wufu Lane, the house was rented by Yu Wenhua from him. In addition, no other evidence was found. Lawyer Wu Kaisheng immediately stood up and stated that regarding Liao Chengzhi's</p>
<p>Address problem, this lawyer urgently needs to declare that He, Liao's mother, originally planned to come to court in person to prove it, but He's old illness relapsed due to her worry about her son, and she cannot come today. However, she has written a letter to prove that her son actually lives with her. After Liao Chengzhi was arrested, detectives from the Old Zha Gate Patrol Room went to He's residence to inquire with detectives from the French Patrol Room. He told the detectives that her son lived in the house, and the detectives continued to ask which room he lived in. He saw that there were many people and was temporarily nervous, so he answered that he did not know, resulting in this misunderstanding and the problem of an unknown address. Fortunately, in the past three days, other than this point, the patrol room lawyer has stated that no other evidence has been found. The presiding judge immediately announced that this case was requested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau for assistance, and the representative of the Public Security Bureau should be asked to state his case. Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Public Security Bureau, then said that the evidence and agreement of the defendants in this case were very consistent, and the court should approve it. As for Liao Chengzhi, because Mr. Liao is the son of the martyr Liao Zhongkai, in theory, he should not have reactionary behavior, so please the court make a ruling according to the evidence and in accordance with the law. Subsequently, the defense lawyers for Luo and Yu argued that the Public Security Bureau is not a formal court,</p>
<p>According to the agreement, Article 6 and Article 13 of the Criminal Procedure Law cannot be transferred. Moreover, the facts of the crime (Center) Liao Chengzhi (Left) Luo Dengxian (Right) Yu Wenhua (National News Agency Photo)</p>
<p>have not yet been verified, so they expressed their opposition to the transfer. Wu Kaisheng also stood up to defend Liao Chengzhi, generally saying that your court and the mainland are both official agencies of the Republic of China, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, President Yu Youren, Vice President Song Ziwen, and other government authorities have all sent telegrams to rescue him. It seems that it is more beneficial for Mr. Liao to be transferred to the mainland, but your court is a formal court and has the right to accept the case and does not need to transfer jurisdiction. However, Mr. Liao is the son of the martyr Zhongkai and his only son. Since his arrest, his mother, He, has been thinking about him abnormally, causing her old illness to recur. She fainted once yesterday and is still lying in bed weeping. For the meritorious adults of the party and the country, and their descendants,</p>
<p>are suffering this implication, how can they not be heartbroken? If there is a crime, it should be accurately proven according to the agreement before the transfer is allowed. Now that three days have passed and no evidence has been found, although there are three doubts, (1) the address problem has been proven by He's letter, (2) someone pointed out that he is a communist, this kind of verbal statement is without evidence and is not enough to be adopted and believed, (3) the notes found on his body are nothing more than IOUs and receipts for lending money to people, so these three points can also be self-defeating. At the end, lawyer Wu cited the example of Soviet personnel coming to China, saying that the Soviet Union is a communist dictatorship, and now we have good relations with it. All the people of the Soviet Union are communists. If these people come to China, can our country also convict them? In short, all countries have communists, and they cannot be convicted just because they are communists. Only those communists who have acts of plotting to subvert the government can be brought to justice. Subsequently, Inspector Lu of the Public Security Bureau reported on the</p>
<p>Case detection situation, saying that the communist Wang Qiliang was first captured on Gonghe Road in Zhabei. Wang confessed that he was the secretary of the National Federation of Trade Unions and expressed his repentance and surrender, willing to report the party's secrets. It was said that the communists were holding a meeting at No. 9 Wufu Lane that day, and the three defendants in this case would all attend. Luo Dengxian was the secretary of the party group of the General Federation of Trade Unions, Yu Wenhua was the uncle of Zhang Guotao, the commander of the Red Army, and Liao Chengzhi was the secretary of the National Seamen's Union. Because he filed a request to the patrol room to send detectives to the place, Liao and others were arrested. Many notes were found on Liao's body, one of which was written with the abbreviation of the Shanghai Anti-Imperialist League. Since there is this kind of evidence, the transfer should be approved in accordance with the established precedent for handling transfer cases. Lu still wanted to state the reasons, but the lawyers of the defendants all said that the legal points were stated by the representative lawyer of the Public Security Bureau, and asked the court to prohibit Lu from speaking, causing</p>
<p>a slight misunderstanding with Lu. Lu's attitude also turned fierce. Subsequently, Zhang Hanqing, a communist who surrendered himself, came to court to testify that he was a member of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party and had worked with the defendants. Luo Dengxian was also a member of the bureau and was later sent as a representative to Manchuria. Recently, he was the secretary of the party group of the General Federation of Trade Unions. Liao Chengzhi returned to China in May last year and served as the secretary of the party group of the Seamen's Union. In November last year, a meeting was held in Zhabei to discuss many measures to harm the Republic of China. Yu Wenhua was Zhang Guotao's uncle and had been convicted and imprisoned, etc. When questioned by the defendants, Luo Dengxian did not admit what Inspector Lu and Zhang Hanqing said. He said that he went to Manchuria as a volunteer army and had worked in a Japanese yarn factory. He had little education and did not know what reaction was. Yu Wenhua confessed that he was released from prison in July last year. Mr. Zhang happened to say that he met me in March last year, which is incomprehensible. The court asked what crime he was imprisoned for. He replied that it was also due to political suspicion. Finally, Liao</p>
<p>Chengzhi's confession, in addition to resolutely denying knowing Zhang Hanqing, also said that he did not expect to be treated favorably because of the glory of his father and mother, but what these people (referring to Lu Zhang) said could not be admitted and demanded unconditional release. The presiding judge then asked the patrol room lawyer if he had any comments on the transfer. Lawyer Gan then said that this case is an assistance case. Under normal circumstances, the Public Security Bureau has two people to prove it, and the transfer should not be opposed. However, if your court thinks that it wants to accept the case, the patrol room can also conduct an investigation, but the law is equal in nature, so it is not convenient to make a difference based on the status. Please consider it in court. After Yu's interrogation, Zhang Prosecutor had no opinion to express, so he and the two judges Zhao Zhou retired to discuss for a moment, and then re-ascended to announce the ruling that Luo Dengxian, Yu Wenhua, and Liao Chengzhi were transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the exhibits were also transferred together. The lawyers of Luo and Yu immediately filed an appeal orally and requested a stay of execution of the ruling, but they were finally rejected by the court. Therefore, Liao and the other three were taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau by Inspector Lu.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Shanghai Municipal Council Solves Water Fee Problem <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Organizing an Advisory Board</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Council is considering the issue of calculating the water bill for household use by meter, and how to properly arrange relief for poor users. Members of the bureau and representatives of the water company are negotiating, and Feng Bingyuan is participating in the discussion from an independent perspective. He has made many contributions to the proposed measures. The water meter system has only recently been widely implemented, and there is little experience in its use. If a permanent water price list is formulated at this time, it seems inappropriate. Therefore, Feng's suggestion is adopted to set a trial period first. During this period, it is hoped that sufficient materials and experience can be obtained to formulate a water meter charging system that can provide reasonable relief to poorer users and make the responsibilities of users at all levels fair. Now, the amount of water required by users at all levels has been estimated. During the trial period, an unequal minimum water price will be charged according to this amount. In places with higher rents, this water bill is slightly higher than the current water meter system. The rate gradually decreases as the rent decreases. In places with extremely low rents, the fee charged for the estimated amount of water is much lower than the current price. For water used beyond the estimated amount, it is calculated according to the lowest water rate. After the above measures are implemented, residents at all levels will have a certain amount of household necessities. The water price is the same as before the implementation of the water meter system for those with lower rents, and lower than the previous proportion of rent for those with higher rents. Now, a few examples are given for clarity, and the situation of water bills during the trial period is as follows:</p>
<p>Example 1: For those with rent between 125 taels and 150 taels, the monthly fixed amount is 11,000 gallons, and the minimum fee is 8 yuan and 25 cents. For excess, the fee is 7 jiao and 5 cents per thousand gallons.</p>
<p>Example 2: For those with rent between 70</p>
<h2>Page 13</h2>
<p>Taels and 80 taels, the monthly fixed amount is 9,500 gallons, and the minimum fee is 5 yuan and 63 cents. For excess, the fee is 5 jiao and 9 cents per thousand gallons.</p>
<p>Example 3: For those with rent between 45 taels and 50 taels, the monthly fixed amount is 7,700 gallons, and the minimum fee is 3 yuan and 56 cents. For excess, the fee is 4 jiao and 6 cents per thousand gallons.</p>
<p>Example 4: For those with rent below 10 yuan, the monthly fixed amount is 3,500 gallons, and the minimum fee is 6 jiao. For excess, the fee is 1 jiao, 7 fen and 8 li per thousand gallons.</p>
<p>During the trial period, it is also planned to organize an advisory board to solve all difficult problems. This advisory board is currently being organized.</p>

<p>Requesting Compulsory Enforcement of the Sanyou Dispute</p>
<p>Please Strictly Investigate the Zhengtai and Other Tragic Cases</p>
<p>The various trade unions in this city believe that the dispute over the shutdown of the Sanyou Industrial Society General Factory in Hudong has not been resolved for more than a year, and the workers are suffering unbearably. The tragic cases of the Zhengtai and Yonghe factories were hastily concluded, and the bereaved families are crying and begging for help. It was decided at a discussion meeting held at the General Federation of Trade Unions the other day to send Zhu Xuefan and other seven people as representatives to petition the municipal government yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the representatives Zhu Xuefan, Ye Xiangnie, Shao Xubai, Long Peiyun, Li Yongxiang, Zhou Xuexiang, etc., carrying a joint petition from the various trade unions, went to the Municipal Government at Fenglin Bridge to pay respects to Mayor Wu. When the mayor was out on official business, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them. First, the representatives stated that (1) the dispute over the Sanyou Factory case has lasted for more than a year because the capitalists have always resisted government orders and refused to accept the judgment, which has been delayed until now and has not been resolved. The lives of the workers are in a desperate situation. The municipal government should quickly enforce the arbitration by effective means. (2) The Zhengtai and Yonghe factories caused unprecedented tragedies due to mismanagement and boiler explosions. They were hastily concluded. Please strictly investigate and order the Social Bureau to reject the factory's record to value human life.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's reply</p>
<p>Then Mr. Yu replied that (1) the Sanyou Factory case has been telegraphed by the Executive Yuan to be handled in accordance with the newly promulgated Labor Dispute Handling Law. The labor side has been ordered to directly request the court for enforcement, so the case can be resolved soon. Before the court executes it, the municipal government will send another letter to urge the execution. (2) Although the factory has reported that the aftermath of the two factory tragedies has been completed, the municipal government is still investigating the responsibility for the accident. If it is due to the factory's negligence, it will not be easily dismissed and will be thoroughly investigated. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<h3 id="e96">City Government Approves Cooperative Experiment Zone Plan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Gradual Stage Yields Real Results</p>
<p>The city's Cooperative Affairs Committee, recognizing that promoting cooperative enterprises without establishing cooperative experiment zones is difficult to achieve effective results, drafted a plan, selected locations, and proceeded gradually. The aim was to stimulate citizens' interest in and understanding of cooperative enterprises. This plan has been submitted by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to the Municipal Government for approval and record. The Shanghai Cooperative Experiment Zone plan is excerpted below: To promote cooperative enterprises in the city, it is proposed to first select suitable locations and pilot cooperative experiment zones to arouse citizens' interest in and understanding of cooperation, thereby promoting the development of cooperative enterprises in the city. (Locations) There are three public housing estates in the city. The first public housing estate is located on Quan Jia An Road in Zhabei, the second public housing estate is located on Luban Road and Xietu Road, and the third public housing estate is located on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. Among the three estates, the second estate has the most residents and a better environment. Therefore, it is designated as the pilot cooperative experiment zone for the city. After the second estate has achieved results, efforts will be made to organize cooperative enterprises in the first and third estates. (Methods) The methods are planned in two steps. The first step is to reorganize the existing consumer cooperative in the second estate to focus on both consumer and credit services. The second step is to organize cooperative enterprises such as production and utilization. The methods are described below: 1. Reorganize the existing consumer cooperative. The second public housing estate established a consumer cooperative in July of the 20th year. However, because the residents of the estate are mostly from the working class, most do not understand the meaning of cooperative societies and lack considerable interest. Therefore, the number of members is small. Moreover, due to the lack of capital and inflexible operation, the society's affairs have not developed much to this day. It is now proposed to reorganize the society into the Shanghai Cooperative Experiment Zone Second Public Housing Estate Cooperative. The steps to be taken are as follows: (1) After the reorganization of the society, its business will include consumption, credit, production, utilization, etc., and will be organized separately. However, the first step is to start with consumption and credit. (2) The general manager of the public housing estate and the administrators of the estate will be responsible for publicizing the meaning of the cooperative to the residents and encouraging them to join the cooperative. (3) The share capital of the consumer cooperative in the estate was originally set at five yuan per share, which is too high. The share price should be reduced to one yuan per share. It is best if members can pay the shares in full at once. If they cannot pay in full at once, they can pay in two or three installments, or deduct it directly from the members' purchase surplus. (4) The capital of the society should be collected from shares as much as possible. If the collected shares are not enough, a low-interest loan may be requested from the Bureau of Social Affairs, which shall be repaid in installments within one year from the society's surplus. (5) The estate has a poverty alleviation fund, which can be borrowed in the name of the estate's cooperative society and used as credit cooperative loans. (6) The society's procurement should focus on the daily necessities of the members, such as rice, firewood, and flour. The amount of procurement and the quality of the goods, as well as the internal expenses of the society, should be reduced as much as possible. Members should be encouraged to volunteer to serve in the society. (7) There are currently 937 male and female residents of the estate with productive capacity. The average monthly income of 213 people is from three to ten yuan, 716 people are from eleven to twenty yuan, and 8 people are from twenty-four to twenty yuan. It can be seen that most of the residents of the estate are in a state of poverty. If poverty is to be alleviated, credit cooperation must be carried out at the same time. The organization should be meticulous, and special attention should be paid to accounting to make it independent. The credit and morality of the members should be improved. On the one hand, the Bureau of Social Affairs should promote and reward it to promote the development of the society. 2. Organize cooperative enterprises for production and utilization, etc. Among the residents of the estate, 393 are rickshaw pullers, 29 are small cart pullers, 43 are grass shoe makers, 13 are reed curtain weavers, 11 are toothbrush threaders, 25 are cobblers, and 88 are yarn spinners. There are many others engaged in production. This point can be used to organize the following businesses: (1) Organize cooperatives with the aim of helping rickshaw pullers and small cart pullers, so that members are not exploited by the owners of the rickshaw companies. (2) Organize small-scale production cooperatives. The society can divide the work according to the needs of the members, such as making grass shoes, weaving reed curtains, threading toothbrushes, and spinning yarn. The purpose is to enable the products of family handicrafts or small crafts to be sold directly in the market, avoiding the exploitation of middlemen. At the same time, appropriate guidance should be given to improve their products and increase their income.</p>

<p>More than 40 Applicants Approved or Rejected Separately</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Security Committee met on March 23rd to discuss the issue of hotels, restaurants, and other applications for licenses. The public was allowed to express their opposition to this issue. Therefore, Colonel Darby of the Salvation Army, representative of the Army and Navy YMCA Zhedeyin, and Dr. Barry attended on that day. Colonel Darby immediately expressed his opinion, saying that there are already many places selling alcohol, and he hopes that the committee will issue as few licenses as possible. Mr. Zhe and Mr. Barry also expressed their agreement with this opinion. The chairman of the committee then thanked the representatives and said that the Public Works Department's issuance of this type of license is based on the happiness and order of the community. Then, the review proceeded as follows: (A) Hotels: Applicants were: 1. No. 85 Shanxi Road, 2. No. 931 to No. 941 Jing'an Temple Road, 3. No. 95 to No. 101 Xihua Road. The first two locations were approved. The third location already had a restaurant license and wanted to apply for a hotel license so that it could sell alcohol outside of meal times. After consideration, it was considered that the location already had sufficient supply and was therefore rejected. (B) Taverns: Applicants were: 1. No. 8 Central Road and No. 15 Xinkang Road, 2. No. 11 and No. 13 Xinkang Road, 3. No. 61 Xizang Road, 4. No. 80 Xieqiao Road, 5. No. 431 Racecourse Road, 6. No. 19 Haining Road, 7. No. 145 Broadway Road.

The fourth location was temporarily approved, pending reports from all locations before approval. The remaining locations were approved. (C) Restaurants (selling alcohol only during meals): There were 15 applicants. Among them, No. 19 Guangdong Road, No. 233 Sichuan Road, and No. 99 Seymour Road, already had a considerable number of places selling alcohol, and the applications were approved without much discussion. No. 71 to No. 721 Jing'an Temple Road, this location was temporarily approved, pending reports from all locations before approval. No. 248A Broadway Road, this location was approved, but the license should state that only mild alcoholic beverages are allowed to be served during meals. No. 3 and No. 5 Yalv Road, someone protested this application. It was resolved to grant a temporary license, but not to disturb the neighboring houses, and to approve it after satisfactory reports from all locations. No. 9, Lane 44, Youheng Road, a temporary license was granted, pending further discussion after reports from all locations. The remaining locations, No. 577 to No. 583 Nanjing Road, No. 741 Jing'an Temple Road, No. 54, No. 55 Laoguan Road, No. 131 Bazilu, and No. 139 East Broadway Road, were all approved.

No. 318 to No. 9 East Broadway Road, and No. 600A East Broadway Road. The first, ninth, and twelfth locations were rejected because there were already many supplies in those locations. The fifth location was rejected because it had not complied with the regulations of the Health Department. The sixth location was granted a temporary license, pending further review of reports from the Public Works Department and the Fire Department. The seventeenth location was granted a temporary license, pending reports from all locations for further review. The twentieth location was rejected because there were already many supplies there, and the police did not approve of granting a license. Later, someone explained that the store owner depended on this for a living, and if he could not sell beer, the income would not be enough. Therefore, he asked the bureau to grant a temporary license for one year, which would surely satisfy the police. The chief of police then stated that there were many similar situations, and if this precedent was set, it would be impossible to refuse others in the future. Therefore, the committee rejected it. All other applicants were approved. In addition, licenses that had already been issued and were renewed in accordance with the regulations were also approved. The committee's decision was submitted to the Board of Directors on the 29th and adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>The head of the Public Health Department of the Public Works Department reported that doctors in this office had vaccinated the staff of a certain company, and the company now requests that vaccination certificates be issued by name. It is found that this type of certificate has always been issued upon request and has never been charged a fee. However, in order to protect the business of practicing physicians, it is proposed to charge a handling fee for this type of certificate, which seems to be beneficial to all parties. This proposal was considered by the Health Committee, which considered it appropriate to charge a small handling fee. Therefore, it was decided that a fee of two yuan per person would be charged for this type of certificate in the future, and the head of the Public Health Department could consider waiving the fee for the poor. This case has been submitted to the Board of Directors and has been approved for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Hudong Residents' Refusal to Cut Off Water Supply: Absolutely Denying Water Rate Increase <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The United Committee of Hudong District Residents Refusing Water Cut-off, based on the resolution of yesterday's emergency meeting, sent letters to the Real Estate Association, the Chinese Directors of the Municipal Council, and Mr. Feng Bingnan, expressing their positions. The contents are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To the Real Estate Association:</p>
<p>Greetings. We believe you have received and reviewed our letter sent on March 25th. Having read in the newspapers that the water fee issue, with a one-third increase before March, has been reluctantly paid by your association for relief, we are deeply grateful for your public spirit. However, according to reports from representatives of Balfour Apartments, Barlow Apartments, Shuncheng Apartments, Sanyuan Lane, etc., the water pipes there have not yet been properly installed. We ask that you promptly consult with the owners to find a solution so that the situation can be restored as soon as possible. Our committee absolutely denies any increase in water fees, and we hope that your association will continue its original intention and work hard to negotiate to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Our committee will follow your lead and pledge to be your strong support.</p>
<p>To the Chinese Directors of the Municipal Council:</p>
<p>Greetings. The British-owned Water Company's increase in water fees and illegal water cut-offs have caused immense suffering to the citizens who bear the brunt of the impact. Considering the company's vicious intentions and harsh measures, it seems determined to put our citizens to death. All Chinese people share a deep sense of indignation. Our committee has therefore contacted the residents of the Eastern District to form the United Committee Refusing Water Cut-off, and, along with the Real Estate Association, has appealed to all parties. The situation has been reported extensively in the newspapers, and we believe it is already well-known. Although the Real Estate Association and mediators have negotiated a temporary transitional solution, paying an additional one-third of the original water package rate for relief up to the end of February, this transitional solution is merely a temporary fix. Since the January 28th Incident, all industries have been depressed, and the economy has reached a low point. Citizens cannot afford to bear any additional burden. Moreover, according to the Water Company's business report on March 30th, it has a surplus profit, making the price increase unnecessary. It is evident that there is an intention to mistreat the common people. We look to you, the directors, to shoulder the important responsibility entrusted by the citizens, and we hope that you will argue reasonably, overturn the water meter system, and restore the original state to maintain the livelihood of the common people and alleviate public suffering. We would be deeply grateful.</p>
<p>To Mr. Feng Bingnan:</p>
<p>We have long admired your demeanor and deeply yearn for your leadership. This water cut-off issue has caused a serious situation. We are deeply grateful for your enthusiasm for public welfare, your efforts in mediation, and the temporary relief obtained. The residents of this district are grateful for your efforts. However, we hope that you will continue to work hard to find a fundamental solution to eliminate public suffering. It would be like saving the lives of countless families.</p>

<p>The budget for the Products Association's participation in the Chicago Exposition is 150,000 yuan. Due to difficulties in fundraising, the Ministry of Finance was requested to provide assistance.

<p>Ministry of Finance Subsidy: The Products Association, facing financial difficulties, planned to request a subsidy of 50,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance.

<h3 id="e112">Guanghua Company Denies Price War with Russian Oil <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>National Monthly Sales of 300,000 Gallons</p>
<p>Plan to Increase Gas Stations to 50</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Guanghua Company, which sells Russian oil in China, denied yesterday that it intended to engage in a price war with companies such as Socony and Asiatic Petroleum. However, it stated that it has a large-scale plan to develop its business in Shanghai and throughout the country. It is said that the company's gasoline price is also one dollar and five cents per U.S. gallon, the same as the prices of Socony, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco. However, the actual selling price can be reduced by five cents for regular customers, and even more for bulk purchases. Currently, the company only has two gas stations in Shanghai, one at 1089 Foch Road and the other near the Nanjing Grand Theatre on Edward VII Avenue. It plans to add 50 more in the two concessions and the north and south cities. Fifty pumps ordered from the United States are expected to arrive this week. Many locations for installation have also been purchased, and construction will begin as soon as approval is obtained from the authorities. The company will do its best to complete the work as soon as possible for the convenience of users. Currently, the company sells approximately 300,000 gallons of gasoline per month nationwide, which is six times more than in the second half of last year. However, compared to the largest competitors, which sell over one million gallons per month, it is still far behind. In addition, the company is also competing fiercely with British and American companies in the kerosene market. Normally, it sells approximately three million gallons per month, but due to the price war among competitors, sales are not reaching that number. It currently has two oil storage facilities in Shanghai, one in Pudong and one in Gaoqiao, and has no plans to add any more for the time being. However, it is currently constructing new storage facilities in Hankou and other major cities in the interior.</p>

<p>White Cotton Cloth with Willow Pattern Found in Chen Shuying's Residence</p>
<p>Writing Discovered on the Cloth Surface After Chemical Testing</p>
<p>Detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police, in cooperation with detectives from the Public Concession, arrested Chen Guang, commander of the Red Army, and his sister, Chen Shuying, for investigation. The police have now chemically tested the white cotton cloth with a willow pattern found in Chen Shuying's residence at 290 Rue Mabilais. Surprisingly, the moment the chemical solution touched the cloth, writing appeared on the surface. This is a method used by the Communist Party for secret communication. Yesterday afternoon, the case was also heard by the Second Higher Branch of the court. The Western detective demonstrated the chemical testing procedure in court. Subsequently, Judge Yu concluded the interrogation and ordered that Chen Guang and Chen Shuying, along with the evidence, be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Police for further interrogation.</p>

<p>During the past week, many piles of scrap iron were suddenly discovered on a vacant lot at the intersection of Caojiadu Wujiaochang and Bailinan Road in West Shanghai. The nearby public noticed and became suspicious. Carloads of scrap iron have been transported from other places and piled up continuously, accumulating more and more. People have also been assigned to tie up the iron into bundles and take turns guarding it. As of yesterday afternoon, there were a total of six to seven hundred dan of scrap iron piled up, all of which were damaged iron sheets, and thick and thin iron bars. Everyone believes that this scrap iron must have been obtained by some traitors who are greedy for profit and willing to assist the enemy. They are all extremely indignant.

<h3 id="e115">Capture of Inland Kidnappers Under Investigation <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Total of Twelve Men and Women – Further Interrogation Scheduled After Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police received a report that a gang of kidnappers who had repeatedly committed kidnapping for ransom in Kunshan, Qingpu, and other places had fled to Shanghai after hiding the kidnapped victims in Benniu Town, Changzhou. They were hiding at 291 Binlang Road in the Public Concession. Therefore, at 4:30 yesterday morning, detectives were dispatched to the Putuo Road Police Station to request assistance in apprehending the criminals. The head of the police station dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the address. Upon arrival, the building was dark and all the men, women, old and young, upstairs and downstairs, were awakened from their dreams. Because the detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police did not initially specify the names of the criminals involved in the kidnapping case, all the occupants of the building were arrested, totaling twelve men and women. Among them were Hao Ziming, Hao Lihong, Hao Lifeng, and Ziming's sisters Chen Hao and Wang Hao, as well as their sister Qian Chen Jingqing and nephew Chen Jingfa, all from Jiangbei. The others were Chen Yushan, a 68-year-old man from Anhui, Chen Shengfan, 52 years old, and Chen Yushan's daughter-in-law Chen Zhao and relative Wang Yu, a total of four people. In addition, there was Zhang Xianghua from Hangzhou. The detectives also found a pistol and 51 bullets under the bed in Chen Yushan's bedroom and brought them back to the police station for separate detention. At 9 o'clock, they were transferred to the First Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Qian Wenji conducted a preliminary hearing. The detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police presented an official letter requesting that all the arrested men and women be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Police for interrogation. However, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang objected, stating that the arrest of these people had not proven who was involved in the kidnapping. If everyone were to be taken away immediately, it would be a serious violation of the Public Concession authorities' intention to protect law-abiding citizens. He requested that everyone be detained for investigation by the police station and that the Shanghai Municipal Police should provide sufficient evidence to prove who the kidnappers were and whether all the men and women were criminals to avoid injustice. Magistrate Qian briefly questioned Hao Ziming and others one by one and ordered them to be temporarily detained separately, pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhou Xiangyun, a wealthy Ningbo businessman, met Wu Yue'e, a prostitute from Dongtingshan working in a brothel named Longyu in 1915. Soon, they rented a house at 100 Qinshou Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and lived together. However, in recent years, Zhou suddenly abandoned Wu and treated her as a stranger, refusing to provide her with living expenses. Although Wu visited him to negotiate, he refused to see her. He also refused to reply to her letters. Wu then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Court, accusing Zhou of abduction and abandonment. After the First Court summoned Zhou several times, Zhou claimed that he had never met Wu and had never seen her before. How could there be such a thing as abduction? Wu presented Zhu, the landlady of Qinshou Lane, to testify in court that Wu and Zhou did live together until 1927. After the debate was concluded, Chief Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division of the First Court announced the judgment yesterday morning: Zhou Xiangyun was acquitted.</p>

<p>Letter from Mr. Xu Xianfu of this city (1)</p>
<p>Mr. Reporter: The letter I hastily replied to on March 2nd amidst busy school affairs was actually published in your esteemed newspaper on the 14th. This letter has raised many questions from you, which you want me to answer. I will now answer them separately. (1) This is your insightful point (3) from your reply on the 14th, which I will address first. The meaning of "feeling" in psychology is that "感" (gan, feeling) is the feeling received from a stimulus (Stimulus), and "慨" (kai, lament/emotion) is Response. The "feeling" in my first letter (published on February 28th) was a kind of strong "emotion" arising from the accumulated "feelings" of the past. Therefore, it was both lengthy and agitated, and I trespassed on your esteemed space. "Research" in English is Research, which is searching for the desired purpose from the environment or materials. This kind of work also happens after a wave of emotion. James believed that the human "self" is composed of three parts: material, social, and spiritual. We often have feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction towards the expression of these three parts, and thus the so-called "self-awareness" arises. I think this step is equivalent to "feeling." James also said that our satisfaction and dissatisfaction with self-awareness lead to physical self-seeking, social self-seeking, and spiritual self-seeking. I believe this is the work of research. Understanding this, then feeling and research are different. And the feeling in my first letter was not venting a pre-existing concept related to the survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation, but rather associating it with the country and the nation after the venting, so I requested publication. But, please do not despise it as feeling, feeling is also related to the country and the nation. For example, Xiang Ji, seeing the awesome power of the King of Qin, exclaimed, "I can take his place!" Later, he led eight thousand men across the river. Ban Chao, working as a government scribe, threw down his pen and sighed! "A real man has no other ambitions, he should also emulate Fu Jiezi and Zhang Qian in establishing merit in foreign lands to be granted a title and land, how can he be confined to writing forever!" Therefore, he opened up the Western Regions. Emperor Taizu of Song drunkenly said to Shi Shouxin and others, "If someone puts a yellow robe on you, even if you don't want it, can you avoid it!" The next day, Shouxin and others begged to resign from the command of the imperial guards. Thus, the military power was relinquished over a cup of wine. Sakyamuni witnessed the inequality of Indian society and felt deeply, saying, "If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell." What was its impact on India and China later? Socialist pioneer Fourier, in 1799, happened to be a clerk in a rice store. The owner ordered him to throw the rotten rice into the sea in order to increase the price of rice. Fourier immediately deeply felt the sin of this kind of commercial capitalism and rose up to reform society. Fichte, angered by Germany's being trampled by Napoleon, after the Battle of Jena (1808), used ardent emotions to publish his Address to the German Nation. What was the impact of this article on the fate of Germany? Here, it should be stated that Fu is also incompetent, how dare he compare himself to the sages, but just cite a few examples. If there is something Mr. doesn't approve of in me, I hope you don't disapprove of the sages because of it! (2) Here, let's discuss the supply power and Western civilization. In China and in the West, "nature" is equally invasive, which Mr. also admits. May I ask, how does China control the difficulties of nature? In a word, it is helpless. For example, the active national wealth cannot be exploited, the national land is inconvenient for transportation, and the passive ones, such as the Yellow River, cannot prevent or provide relief for floods. But Western civilization is not like this, it can stop and overcome nature and can also use it to supply people with the knowledge and technology of evolution (it is said that a German engineer used an artificial Yellow River to study the Yellow River's water conservancy, why doesn't China have it), this is the difference between Eastern and Western civilizations, that is, the characteristic of Western civilization, calling it the essence, who says it is not appropriate! Then the two sentences in my first and second letters are both true, and not one is true and one is false. In a capitalist environment, in a socialist environment, "nature" is also equally invasive, which is also admitted by Mr. But Mr. believes that there are also differences in the supply power between capitalism and socialism, because "conquering nature is carried out in human society." This sentence, I think, accidentally puts the cart before the horse, because human society is carried out in the human conquest of nature. Historical facts tell us, no need to seek it in ancient times, the emergence of modern capitalism, after the industrial revolution in the late 18th century, is after the technological progress of human control and utilization of nature. The world competition of imperialism began after Darwin's theory of evolution of "survival of the fittest", that is, after the intellectual progress of human overcoming of nature. Even in the current Soviet Union, her knowledge and technology of conquering nature, which one is not quoted by capitalist countries! Such as American engineers, German machinery, etc. Her socialist society, in terms of knowledge and technology 丨丨 The power of supply is not completely different from capitalist society, but the direction of applying knowledge and technology is different. What Mr. said, has the adjectives "planned, systematic, most economical, and most fully", which only expresses the characteristics of the direction of the socialist dominance of the quantity, in other words, like the Soviet socialist country, her application of human knowledge and technology tends to the direction of "planned, systematic, most economical, and most fully". Dr. Walter W. Lucasse of the United States said: "They (pure scientists) handed over knowledge to society, and society should be fully responsible for whether it uses it properly or improperly." Then why don't we say that capitalism's application of evolutionary knowledge and technology is improper, and socialism's application of evolutionary knowledge and technology is proper, which depends on how we control and dominate society? It has nothing to do with the power of supply. This is why Britain, Germany, and the United States are Britain, Germany, and the United States, and the Soviet Union is the Soviet Union. So what I said "the difference between capitalism and socialism lies only in the power of guiding the direction of human evolution" does not lose half of the true content. (3) Here, I will reply to Mr. Fourteen's point (2) again. Regarding this point, Mr. seems to have a misunderstanding in my first letter. I dare to say that Mr.'s misunderstanding is that he thinks the main body of that letter is the public health problem. In fact, I feel the fanaticism and wasteful danger and unsuitability of sports among some of our country's rulers and so-called leaders, as well as some young people and urban people. From those accumulated stimuli, it was fully released in the most recent and stronger stimuli, and this kind of aversion chained other aversions, that is, from feeling that sports is not the way out of China to associating that the way out of China lies in saving the foolish. The proposal of military training and productive labor to alleviate health problems is just a step back, this can be reviewed. Since Mr. has this misunderstanding, the five questions raised are also aimed at solving the health problem. In fact, they are the whole way out for them (workers and peasants), finding their way out is also finding China's way out. And whether Chinese society will be under the power of capitalist dominance or the power of socialist dominance also depends on this. As for Mr.'s point (4), I don't need to say much about the difference between capitalism and socialism, because Mr. himself has answered for me above. What's more, the sages and pioneers in history have pointed out to us, and the Soviet Union and other countries have divided for us in fact. Finally, I express regret for the fact that the words in the last letter were more than the meaning! But I don't know what about this letter?</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern, We have recently been informed by our clients, Mr. Pan Xiangsheng and Ji Zhongren, that they have read a news item in yesterday's Shen Bao, "Pan Xiangsheng and Ji Zhongren Accused of Encroaching on Estate," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. We believe that although newspaper reports are based on the principle of recording everything heard, but before the case is adjudicated, the right and wrong are not yet clear, the newspaper should not make a big hue and cry, so as to make a one-sided propaganda and damage the reputation of others. Therefore, we have entrusted your lawyer to represent them and send a letter to the newspaper, requesting correction, etc. We hereby inform you accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and correct it quickly.

<h3 id="e124">Jiangsu Education Department Strictly Handles the Handover of County Education Directors <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>▲ Former Rugao Education Director Summoned to the Province</p>
<p>丨Has Been Released on Bail to Borrow Money丨</p>
<p>Since Director Zhou of the Jiangsu Education Department took office, he has attached great importance to the handover of education directors in various counties. Since the 16th year of the Republic, there have been more than 170 cases of new and old education directors in various counties who have not completed the handover or have not even handled the handover. The department has been actively managing since last winter, repeatedly ordering the previous and current education directors to complete the handover within a time limit, strictly checking and auditing the numbers. As of now, dozens of counties have been processed, and the rest are being processed. It is heard that all can be cleared this summer vacation. Recently, the former Director of the Rugao County Education Bureau, Rui Jiarui, handled the receipt and expenditure of education fees totaling more than 1.5 million yuan. After the handover, the bureau submitted the director's accounts to the Economic Audit Committee for review. As a result, it was found that the amount of extravagant expenses and amounts without formal receipts reached 40,000 yuan. The county government submitted the review forms to the Education Department for approval. The Education Department instructed the former director to go to the Rugao Education Bureau for accounting on March 1st and sent personnel to supervise the audit. Unexpectedly, the former director did not go to Rugao at the appointed time. The supervisors summoned the county director and representatives of the Economic Audit Committee to conduct a detailed audit of the review forms. It was determined that the extravagance was indeed extravagant, and those that should be deleted totaled more than 11,000 yuan. A list was prepared and jointly submitted to the Education Department. The Education Department believed that the former director's extravagance during his tenure had been clearly audited by the supervisors and should be strictly recovered to emphasize special funds. The Education Department immediately presented it to the provincial government and sent officials to Nanjing to verify the former director's residence and summon him to the province to calculate the list and send a copy to the former director, ordering him to clarify and reply. After further verification, in addition to ordering the bureau to review the various amounts, it was calculated that more than 4,000 yuan should be paid first, and he was instructed to raise the money and hand it over immediately. The former director could not raise money in the department and sought the Nanjing Xinli Construction Company and Gongxing Coal Company as guarantors, and the principal of a certain private school in Nanjing jointly guaranteed to bear 1,000 yuan of responsibility. The Education Department has now approved the bail to go out to raise money. Furthermore, those former education directors in various counties who have outstanding public funds that have not been supplemented as ordered, and a few who have delayed and disobeyed the order to handle the handover, will be requested to be wanted and transferred to the court for handling according to law.</p>

<p>▲ Improve Scientific Equipment to Create a Cultural Environment ▲ Promote Advanced Research and Popularize National Education</p>
<p>The Joint Association of University Faculty and Staff in Shanghai previously resolved to issue a declaration on academic nation-saving. The second standing committee meeting appointed Chen Jilie to jointly review with the original drafter Kang Xuanyi. Chairman Zhang Shouyong made the final amendments and signed and sent the telegram. The original telegram is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Public gong to all levels of schools, cultural institutions, and academic groups in the country. A nation exists in the world, and it must have a foundation for its existence. What is it? It lies in academics. Tracing back to history, verifying recent events, and examining how France was able to recover after defeat, and how Germany was able to survive even though it was divided, the fundamental basis for its recovery and survival is nothing else, but the prosperity of academics. Our country has inherited thousands of years of culture. Not only does everyone have characteristics, but even in terms of science, there have been creations and inventions throughout the dynasties. It is only because we are content with simplicity, lose our spirit, and do not seek progress that we are bewildered and fall behind. The violent therefore take advantage of it, regardless of the world's trends, and are completely contrary to the world's trends. And we Chinese reflect on ourselves, there are hundreds of ways to get sick, but there is only one way to win. Why is the countryside bankrupt? Why are factories dilapidated? Why does commercial warfare fail? And why can't education be popularized? Why is morality declining day by day? All are the harms of not emphasizing academics. Therefore, saving the country lies only in academics. If academics prosper, then farmers, workers, and merchants will all get its guidance. In peacetime, it is beneficial to politics, and in wartime, it is beneficial to the military. And mechanical precision and convenient transportation are all embodied in this. At this time of serious national crisis, we should take actively resisting violent Japan as the current palliative measure, and take promoting academics as the fundamental plan for saving the country. This has been resolved by the general meeting to take April 1st as the total mobilization of the national education community, that is, to take academic nation-saving as the period for jointly going to the national crisis. From this day on, we will unanimously base on this meaning, work hard together to improve scientific equipment, create a cultural environment, promote advanced research, popularize national education, enrich the elements of establishing a country, and complete spiritual construction and material construction. Do not advocate empty talk, do not seek quick results, use three years of wormwood to cure seven years of disease, mend the fold after the sheep is lost, the mulberry elm has not yet fallen, and saving the crisis depends on this. As for the detailed plan for academic nation-saving, the colleagues of this association have shallow academic positions, and are deeply afraid of not contributing to the advanced. I hope that the gentlemen will express their great opinions and give guidance so that we can follow the path. We hereby send our connections first, and we will wait for your enlightenment. The United Association of Faculty and Staff of Shanghai Universities kowtows.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Sports Hall Opening Ceremony <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM, the opening ceremony of the Fook Kai Seen Sports Hall was held. More than 500 guests arrived. After the ceremony was held as scheduled, President Li reported first, briefly stating that school education, moral education, intellectual education, group education, and physical education are equally important. Our school has always paid attention to physical education. In the spring of the 29th year of Guangxu during the late Qing Dynasty, it created the sports meeting as the pioneer of various schools. Afterwards, it has been held every year, up to now for 30 years. However, there are still many deficiencies in terms of equipment. After I became the president of the school, I considered this and planned to build and expand this field. The project started in July of the 19th year of the Republic of China and lasted for two years and eight months to this day. The construction cost is about 10,000 yuan. The entire field covers an area of 40 mu and has become the latest type of sports field with a width of 8 meters and a circle of 400 meters. Outside, there is a 200-meter straight track. The land inside the track is also used as a football field and military training field. If cement grandstands can be built around it in the future, it can become a complete sports field. This field is named Fook Kai Seen to commemorate the pioneer Dr. Fook Kai Seen. Dr. Fook Kai Seen served as the supervisor of this school for four years during the establishment period of the school, building school buildings and managing education affairs. He also carefully studied Chinese studies and vigorously promoted physical education. His promotion of merit has reached the country, and it is not only what the colleagues of this school should be grateful for. I deeply hope that the younger generation of students will come to this field and recall Dr. Fook Kai Seen's deep meaning of promoting physical education, and never forget the spirit of this school to promote physical education, strengthen the body to strengthen the species, and reach others by reaching themselves, etc. Then Mrs. Decker, daughter of Fook Kai Seen, gave the opening speech, briefly saying that it is very happy to participate in the opening ceremony of the Fook Kai Seen Sports Hall of your school today. I am especially honored that your school named the field after my father's name. I deeply hope that all the students can use this good sports field to increase the health of each person's physique. Finally, he apologized on behalf of Fook Kai Seen for not being able to come and participate, etc. Then Dr. Wang Zhengting gave a speech, briefly saying that 37 years ago, this place was called Nanyang, and it is still deeply imprinted in my mind. In the past, it was not easy to start new schools and introduce Western culture to the East, so there were very few schools. Your school was able to start in a difficult environment, and this cannot but be attributed to Mr. Fook Kai Seen. Furthermore, in the beginning, schools focused on knowledge and character, and did not pay attention to health at all, but Mr. Fu had a broad vision and worked hard to promote it. Nanyang's ability to have today's glory in sports cannot but be attributed to Mr. Fook Kai Seen. Now I encourage you with the word "constant". We should not have a five-minute heat, we must have a permanent heat, etc. Finally, the Public Security Bureau Military Band played music and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Student Army Grand Review <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>

Led by the Public Security Bureau Military Band, they marched around the Fook Kai Seen Sports Hall for a week with neat steps and a magnificent military appearance.

<p>Sino-British International Billiards Competition</p>
<h3 id="e139">China Wins First Championship <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>China Wins a Total of 834 Points After Five Days, Li Gongying Defeats Bernal</p>
<p>(Final Battle): Unfavorable in the First Half, Major Victory in the Second Half, Score is 1000 Points to 776 Points</p>
<p>In the Sino-British international billiards competition, after five days of competition, China won a total of 834 points, securing the first championship. The five Chinese representatives in this competition each made significant contributions; it was not the effort of just one or two people. In the final battle yesterday, China's "Billiards King" Li Gongying faced the renowned British veteran Bernal. Li was at a disadvantage in the first half, but turned defeat into victory in the second half. As a result, Li scored 1000 points to Bernal's 776 points, creating a record of China winning four out of five matches. The Yong'an Company and Mr. Li Minzhou of the Xin Xin Company each presented silver cups, engraved with the names of the victors, to be kept permanently at the Bank Club as a lasting memorial.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Performing Well in Favorable Circumstances <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The performance of the leading players from both countries was not as exceptional as their usual peak performance. Li had some inconsistencies, while Bernal was more seasoned and steady. In the first ten shots, Li had a slight advantage, 105 to 92. After another five shots, Bernal took the lead. After another five shots, they were even again. By the thirty-fifth shot, Bernal was ahead by 64 points. Soon, Li gradually improved. By the forty-sixth shot, Li was behind by as many as 100 points. Before long, Bernal, finding himself in a favorable situation, performed exceptionally well, scoring continuously, adding up to 497 points. With only three more points needed to finish the first half, the old general showed great vigor in his old age but suddenly held back six times, giving Li the opportunity to make a final move. Unfortunately, Li did not gain much, and Bernal finished the 500 points at 442.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Using Skill to Turn Defeat into Victory <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The situation in the second half was completely different. After the fifth shot at the start, Bernal scored 52 points, but there were no other special achievements. Li, after scores of 40 and 56, brought the two sides to a level playing field. At the fifteenth shot, the opponent's ball had fallen into the hole, the red ball was near the bottom edge, and the cue ball was on the left side. With no direct path to hit the red ball, Li used a skillful technique, touching the red ball and circling around it, falling into the hole on its own. The spectators were amazed and applauded. After this ball was made, Li continuously hit the red ball and made the cue ball fall into the hole 18 times, scoring 59 points. From then on, he turned defeat into victory. At the thirty-fifth shot, he made many consecutive "ma balls," scoring 71 points. Soon after, he scored another 45 points, and the victory was secured. The final result was 1000 points to 776 points.</p>

<p>The five-day competition has been detailed in this newspaper in recent days. There are noteworthy aspects of the individual skills of the five Chinese players. On the Chinese side, Li Gongying has yet to fully demonstrate his capabilities, but his several comebacks from seemingly impossible situations were truly beyond the reach of ordinary people. Shen Lince has made much progress, showing versatility. Zhang Yingda has a firm grip on his shots, making them freely and easily. Liu Fuzong's skills are inherently excellent, but he has been unlucky. Xu Shizhang is bold, meticulous, and skillful with his hands. Among the five British players, Bernal is known for his experience, McShell and Nema exert their utmost effort, Baker has moments of incredible skill, and Marx suffers from stage fright.</p>

<p>Improper Conduct Deserves Severe Punishment; Guanghua Players Receive Warning</p>
<p>Emergency Resolution by the Middle School Sports Federation Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Sports Federation held an emergency meeting yesterday morning at the Sports Advancement Association to discuss the basketball dispute between Guanghua and Nanshang on the 28th of last month. The attendees included Wu Lisheng from Shangzhong, Zhang Xi'en from Chizhi, Zhang Kan from Pudong, Mao Sucen, Wu Yuru, and Wu Zhongkang from Nanshang, Chen Bingde and Zeng Hanmo from Fushi, Han Kuiyong from Fuzhong (also representing Minli), Shen Meizhen from Daxia, Lu Xiangqian from Guanghua, Peng Sanmei from Hujiang, and basketball committee members Zhang Wugao and Dong Xiaopei, totaling fifteen people. First, the referee's report from that day and a letter from the Guanghua basketball team were distributed to the attendees. Then, Zhang Wugao was elected as the temporary chairman. During the discussion of the disciplinary measures, the representatives from Nanshang and Guanghua left the meeting. The full text of the resolution is published below:</p>
<p>According to the reports from the referee and the staff present at the venue, during the basketball championship game between Nanyang Commercial High School and Guanghua High School on the 28th of last month, held at the Zhonghua Basketball Hall, students and cheerleaders from Nanshang rushed onto the court and beat Guanghua players. This conduct was extremely improper and deserves severe punishment to maintain discipline and serve as a warning to others. Therefore, it was resolved to suspend Nanyang Commercial High School from all sports competitions in the Federation for one year (from April 1933 to March 1934). After the suspension period, the school authorities must provide a firm guarantee before being allowed to participate in competitions again. During the first year after rejoining, it will be a probationary period. If any further improper behavior is discovered, the school's membership will be immediately revoked. The game in question will be considered a forfeit by Nanshang, and Guanghua will be declared the winner. As for the Guanghua basketball team, their players' actions in this season's games have been less than satisfactory and should be warned to emphasize sportsmanship.</p>

<p>The sports series published by Shanghai Qin Fen Bookstore has already published more than forty titles and has long been praised by the sports community throughout the country. It is now heard that the bookstore has published "German Revival Gymnastics." The original author is the renowned German sports expert, Mr. Ateur Holger.

Therefore, Qin Fen Bookstore invited sports experts Pei Xiyuan and Lu Xiangqian to translate this book into Chinese, so that the Chinese people can adopt it concretely. The whole book is divided into eighty-four sections, including "upper limbs," "lower limbs," "body," "swinging," "bending," "squatting," "head," "correction," "abdomen," "waist," "balance," "jumping," and "mimicking." Each section is accompanied by clear illustrations, making it easy for readers to understand. The entire book is priced at five jiao, with a special price of 10% off. An additional three fen is charged for postage to other locations, and eight fen for registration.

<p>丨Willing to Drink April 7th Wine丨丨Do Not Be an April 1st Fish丨</p>
<p>The weather in April is perfect for spring outings! Especially for the spring vacation tour groups between Six Bridges and Three Temples, enjoying the leisurely life of ascending buildings to drink wine and watching fish by the water; however, expanding the panoramic view of the world, I am willing to drink America's April 7th wine, but not be Europe's April 1st fish.</p>
<p>Since the wets succumbed to the dries, the American people have not been able to drink their fill of alcoholic beverages for thirteen years! Fortunately, after Roosevelt took office, he first relaxed the prohibition of distilled spirits; from one minute past midnight on April 7th, the average New World alcoholic could freely drink his fill! The opening of the liquor ban, which has been buzzing for years, only had the possibility of realization in April; no wonder the day the president was inaugurated, the large liquor barrel strutted its stuff in the parade. I can imagine the American alcoholics, whose mouths have been parched, pouring cup after cup into the liquor urns that have been dry for thirteen years, which is called being willing to drink America's April 7th wine.</p>
<p>April 1st is April Fool's Day, and people in various European countries take pleasure in fooling others on this day; in English custom, anyone who is fooled on this day is called an April fool. In Scottish custom, the person who is fooled is called an April cuckoo, and they often throw a game letter at people, saying:</p>
<p>On the first of April, strike the cuckoo in the wood of another mountain.</p>
<p>The receiver often replies:</p>
<p>The cuckoo and the skylark roost in the same tree... I am the same as both of you, I am a cuckoo, and you are also cuckoos.</p>
<p>In French custom, the person who is fooled on this day is called an April fish; why is he called a fish? It is said that April is the birth season of fish, and young fish are often easily deceived; therefore, the fool is the April fish. We have the idiom "fish and meat countrymen," meaning the deceived countrymen can also be called fish, but there is no mention of April, and they are almost fish who are deceived for life! The fish that Europeans talk about being deceived is only accidentally a fish on April 1st, and after this day, he is no longer a fish, which is called not being an April 1st fish of Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Yellow Peril <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>The yellow race conquered half of Europe, and even now Europeans still use this event to scare children. As a member of the yellow race, I am fortunate enough to have lived this life.</p>
<p>I have heard that the conquest of half of Europe by the yellow race is not only frightening to children in Europe, but even adults over fifty years old are praying to God day and night like blind people fearing the collapse of the sky, not to catch the sleeping bug in the nose of the sleeping lion of the East, otherwise, it is said that the "yellow peril" will engulf the entire earth.</p>
<p>Since conquering half of Europe, the sleeping lion of the East has been accumulating virtue, sleeping all the time, without eating a single white person, and it seems that it will not move a step until the hunters have tied it up tightly before it yawns. This situation can be considered as a dose of peace of mind for the white race.</p>
<p>Things are not easy to predict. The lion is sleeping sweetly, but the skinny yellow dog next to it is getting fatter and fatter, and more and more fierce. At first, it only nibbled at the lion's claws, but the year before last it simply swallowed the lion's tail. Recently, the yellow dog has become even more like it's gone mad, barking wildly at any shadow it sees.</p>
<p>The white race knows that the sleeping lion will not wake up for a while, and is happily planning to arrange it, but now it is dominated by the mad yellow dog, not allowing them to approach the sleeping lion. Watching the yellow dog swallow the lion's tail and gradually nibble at its belly, they suddenly remembered the "yellow peril" that Europeans talked about, which actually fell on the yellow dog.</p>
<p>The yellow dog, one day after eating the sleeping lion, will have an ever-growing appetite, and when it's hungry, it will easily swallow a white person in one bite, without leaving even bone fragments. At that time, "yellow" will truly become a "peril," which I am afraid will not only be used to scare children. I, side-by-side with the yellow dog with the word yellow, am grateful, grateful, take the opportunity, take the opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Milk <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Chuyao</p>
<p>The mere writing of that thought-provoking word "milk" immediately brings to mind tender white breasts, the two rounded hemispheres bulging to the left and right, like white jade; the mysterious apexes of the hemispheres, dotted with purplish-red lotus seeds, resembling two intoxicating fresh flowers, still in bud. Seated in a comfortable sofa, the warm sunlight basking one into a sleepy stupor, closing one’s eyes and thinking of this, one would feel the joy of a drunken man!</p>
<p>In my hometown of Hangzhou, the value of a woman’s breasts can be divided into three stages: the breasts of a maiden are cast from gold, because they are hidden inside a small vest, as precious as gold, not easily displayed for others' enjoyment; the breasts of a young married woman, they seem not as precious as gold? It is said that they are forged from silver, because they cannot belong solely to the woman forever as those of a maiden; a young woman’s breasts, half of the time they belong to her beloved husband. But, though this is said, aside from her husband, this charm will not be revealed; however, it is no longer as precious as gold! Only the woman who has already given birth to a child, in my hometown, they are called "dog grandma," because they no longer have the mystery of the maiden or young woman! In front of anyone, she would unashamedly pull out her breasts, once called gold and silver, to feed her child; it is like dog milk, belonging to the public! It is like a plaster model that can be admired by the public! It has lost the magical power that once made people fascinated and incredulous.</p>

<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>My heart filled with desolate and sorrowful spring night, I could not overcome the loneliness invading the small building, so I left my residence and walked alone towards the Venus Café, stepping into the small door illuminated by neon lights, I heard a burst of mournful music, and rushed into it amid the mournful rhythms.</p>
<p>The dim green light nurtured the joys and sorrows of the world. Here, there are endless laughter, buried sorrows, and exotic atmosphere. In a dimly lit corner, I ordered a bottle of Shanghai beer, sitting silently, as if leaving my troubled homeland, watching many foreign children dancing wildly, singing merrily, whispering sweet nothings, confiding in honeyed tones, but I did not know a single person, sitting alone drinking bitter beer, this is still the territory of my great China!</p>
<p>At the top four corners of this dance hall hung four glass lanterns riddled with holes, emitting five-colored light that swirled around, scattering disordered rays from the holes, like ghostly eyes, like divine lamps, making you dazed and turned into a colorblind person.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and looked around, there were Anglo-Saxons, Slavs, Japanese, and also a Han Chinese like me, holding sorrows of my great China, this place seems like an international café.</p>
<p>Many sailors drunkenly embraced slender waists while dancing, scantily dressed foreign dancers, half-naked in thin spring clothes, with white powder and rouge, sent flirtatious winks and giggles to the seated guests. Ah, money oppresses women, selling youth and soul. The increasing number of prostitutes in society is a prelude to the gradual decline of society.</p>
<p>On the music platform, a tune was played and another was changed. Revelers danced waltzes and blues, floral dances, tangos, as if the world had only this one night, and tomorrow people would part ways and drift into wandering journeys, filling with hedonism. Let us enjoy this short spring night to the fullest, let us be merry, people who have gathered temporarily on the journey! It made me hear a deep taste of sorrow, which I drank into my heart with bitter wine.</p>
<p>The night was deep, and amid the revelry and dancing of the lingering night, I had forgotten the passage of the night. I looked at my watch and it was already half past three in the morning. A bottle of beer had unknowingly been finished, so I left Venus among the revelry of men and women, burying my head in the collar of my spring coat. The spring breeze on the road was warm, and I still walked alone on the silent street to return to my residence, only the street lamp illuminated my shadow on the smooth asphalt road.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Finally, he tries to undo the knot, but is denied entry; Secretly pitying her innocence, he offers food to share</p>
<p>Thinking this, he immediately ran back to the house, sat on the kang (heated brick bed), and said with a stern face, "We are not from a lowly family, why do we let people look down on us like this?" Madam Jiang said, "Sigh! You don't need to mention this matter again. People have come to apologize to us, so that's enough. What else are you saying?" Guizhi originally wanted to tell her mother what she had just heard. But on second thought, her following Ji out was not a wise move, so she thought it best not to tell her mother. Therefore, she remained silent, lowered her head, and sat on the kang. The next morning, the Gan family's servant brought two dollars, saying that it was the payment for the clothes made before, and it was all settled now. According to the Second Master, the two dollars were only extra, and there would be no shortage. Guizhi heard this, and this was another sign of cutting off relations. She thought, she had never cared about the amount of wages when making clothes for the Second Master, and the Second Master saying such things meant that he also looked down on her. As she thought this in her heart, Madam Jiang had the same thought, and quickly ran outside the house and said, "We spend our strength to earn every penny. People as rich as your master and second master would certainly not let us poor people suffer, but we work properly with people and don't want extra money from them. I am a widow, and my child is a grown girl, why should we want extra money from people?" These words are not good to say or hear!" Madam Jiang said all this, and her face stiffened. The servant said, "Are you angry with me? These words were not said by me, nor by our Second Master. You are blaming the wrong person." After he finished speaking, he turned around and left. The arrival of this servant stirred up Guizhi's temper again, and she secretly resolved that she would not associate with the Gan family in the future, no matter what. From that day on, she did not go to the Gan family, but stayed at home with her mother to work. On the morning of the third day, because the water carrier had something to do and did not come, and the family was waiting for water to drink, Guizhi took a white iron bucket and carried a bucket of water from the well and walked towards the house. In the past, moving half a bucket of water at home did not feel strenuous, so she did not hesitate to carry a bucket of water back from the well. The distance from the well to the door was about half a mile, and she had to stop several times on the way before she had walked even a third of the way. (29)</p>
<h3 id="e161">Shanghai Night Talk: Smoking Shops <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruotun</p>
<p>Recently, in my spare time from work, I have added a new hobby of smoking cigarettes, in addition to sipping coffee.</p>
<p>I once made a vow: if I were to smoke, I would definitely smoke "Chesterfields." Because the large "Chesterfield" advertisements on the street, with their American modern romantic paintings, are especially captivating under the red and green electric lights. Moreover, the fragrant and beautiful lines, "When a girl is in the spring of her life, Chesterfields entice her," are so evocative!</p>
<p>Since I started learning to smoke, I have smoked many strange brands of cigarettes. My criteria for buying cigarettes is to choose brands with interesting names. My favorite on weekdays is "Charming Prince" (commonly known as "Taizi," or "Prince"), followed by "Black Cat." If I can't buy "Flowers of May," I buy domestic cigarettes "Xuangong" and "Tianxian." "Red Lips" are indeed very fragrant and alluring, but they are rarely popular on the market.</p>
<p>There is a cigarette shop near Zhenfei Road and Jin Shenfu Road that uses "Smoking Shop" as its name. It is a place I often visit. They display samples of various strange brands of cigarettes, all of which are rare on the market. There are almost ten kinds of Russian cigarettes alone, including "Caucasus" produced by Soviet Russia, and half-cigarettes with paper tubes made by White Russians; "Kismet," "Isis," "Ada," "Aliegro," etc.</p>
<p>At the intersection of Maierxi Ai Hongyi Main Road, opposite the Khitan Grand Theater, there is a Japanese-run grocery store that exclusively manages a French "National" brand of tricolor cigarettes. The fragrance is strong, with the aroma of cigars, and it does not dry the throat. After the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), I have not visited there for a long time.</p>
<p>The most exquisite cigarette cases include the silver hard iron box of "My Princess," and the "Monas," packaged in a paper box with twenty cigarettes. The most modern is the British-made "du Maurier," which comes in packs of ten or twenty. The cigarette tip is made of a hygienic wrinkled paper, like a cotton head, which is better than ordinary rubber tips. The price is very expensive, each cigarette costs twelve copper coins.</p>
<p>If someone likes to collect color movie star cards, I advise them to smoke the thick and fat "Commander" brand; if they like to collect colorful Western paintings, I advise them to smoke the "Tianxian" brand.</p>
<p>The original name of cigarette tobacco in English, as we all know, is called "Tobacco." The best Chinese translation is "Danbagu." In French it is "Tobaco," and in Spanish it is "Tabago."</p>
<p>The original discovery of tobacco is said to be in Tabasco, one of the British islands, and some say it is in Tobacco in the Gulf of Mexico. The name of tobacco is derived from these two place names.</p>
<p>Tobacco was first introduced to Europe by Spanish merchants, and became a daily pastime in France. The first to promote it was Jean Nicot, the ambassador to France appointed by Catherine de' Medici.</p>
<p>In addition to "Danbagu," there are many other meaningful nicknames for tobacco. As far as I know, there are "Danbugui" (don't return), "Nanmancao" (southern barbarian grass), "Nanlingcao" (southern spiritual grass), "Duobogu," "Xibagu," "Danpogu," "Xiangsicao" (love-sickness grass), etc.</p>
<p>Among modern literary works, the Japanese writer Yokomitsu Riichi's "The Lit Cigarette," also known as "The Misfortune of a Cigarette Collector," (contained in Guo Jianying's translation of Yokomitsu Riichi's collection "The Bridegroom's Thoughts") uses cigarettes as the subject matter.</p>
<p>Below is a short excerpt from that novel:</p>
<p>"I am now smoking cigarettes self-destructively, because I want to prove whether this thing is magic. Who would have thought that love would jump out of this hazy smoke? This is indeed a magic trick. Otherwise, it must be the harm of cigarettes. I now swear that I will never smoke again. ... Um, cigarettes are indeed harmful, let's light them and burn them. ... In his mind, countless lit cigarettes lined up, as if on a musical score, and began to swim towards him. | Dames-Opera-High Life-DaCapo-La Came-La Rubia..."</p>

<h3 id="e162">The Whole Line Outside the Pass is Peaceful and Safe <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>Ever since Rehe fell "as expected," we had long anticipated that the "anti-Japanese comedy" had reached its "finale." Although the sounds of resistance are still incessant, and the telegrams requesting action are still generous and impassioned, some people are even shouting "unified military command" and "controlled economy," with the pretense of a "determination" to fight. But everyone already understands that this is just an "encore," a farcical pantomime. Sure enough, in the midst of the deafening cries of "saving the country with aviation," the entire line outside the pass seized the opportunity to quietly declare "peace and security."</p>
<p>What will happen after the whole line is peaceful? Based on the past experience of the September 18th and Shanghai battles, it will probably be nothing more than a "round table conference" or some kind of "agreement." However, things will still inevitably have some twists and turns. On the one hand, our "authorities" have repeatedly stated that the claim of "direct negotiations" is a "baseless rumor." On the other hand, according to the opinion of Japanese Ambassador to China Ariyoshi: "Now that Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, if China and Japan negotiate directly, it will invisibly raise China's international status." The tone also clearly has the meaning of "disdaining" to negotiate directly with us. If we do not "fight" and cannot "make peace," then how should the subsequent plays be staged? Of course, the most appropriate method is to "drag it out," drag it out for a year or so, and wait for "national understanding" (borrowing Ariyoshi's words) before making a decision.</p>
<p>The entire line outside the pass is already peaceful and safe. Although the northeast half of the country has changed color, it is indeed a gratifying thing that the Japanese can "know when to stop" and "not go too far." Moreover, according to Mr. ××: "The lost territory in the Northeast will definitely be recovered by the end of this year." So, there is no need to worry about this. But what we are most worried about right now is Ariyoshi's nonsense. He said: "Although the military leaders of the provinces have temporarily suspended the civil war due to external tension, the undercurrent is still surging, but they are all restrained by the criticism of the Chinese people and dare not become the leaders of the war themselves." Of course, under the declaration of "sincere unity and resistance to foreign aggression" by our military and political authorities over the past two years, we must not believe Ariyoshi's words to be true. However, "sincere unity" is for "resistance to foreign aggression." When there is no aggression to resist, who can guarantee that our generals will not feel that "the flesh on their thighs has grown back" and put on another comedy?</p>
<p>The "anti-Japanese" comedy is coming to an end, but audiences, please wait, the "best show" is yet to come!</p>
<h3 id="e163">Ferryman <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Peng</p>
<p>I first met him on an evening two years ago.</p>
<p>It was also this kind of early spring weather. Several friends and I passed by this ferry crossing. When we stepped into the ferry, the first person I saw was this ferryman. Such a withered old man, with sparse hair and beard, hunching his back, constantly coughing. Looking at his aged state, you wouldn't believe that he could row the oars so lightly and nimbly:</p>
<p>"Ferryman! Have you been eating this for a long time?"</p>
<p>"For a long time. Generations of family tradition, I've been doing this since I was a child."</p>
<p>"How is the daily income?"</p>
<p>"It's not bad. As long as I can ferry thirty times a day, five people each time, then each person pays two copper coins, which would be three thousand cash in profit, enough for the family to eat!"</p>
<p>A smile of contentment with life spread across his wrinkled face; while rowing the oars, he began to sing a mountain song: "In April, the wheat fields will meet with lovers..." He rocked us to the other side.</p>
<p>Afterward, I occasionally passed by this ferry crossing. The ferryman's optimistic smile and singing gradually left a cordial impression in my mind!</p>
<p>But last autumn, when I passed by the ferry crossing again, I suddenly saw that the usual happy look on his face had disappeared. I casually asked:</p>
<p>"Ferryman, why aren't you singing mountain songs?"</p>
<p>"How can I be in the mood to sing mountain songs: I can see that I'm about to have no food to eat!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Tell you, sir: It's all because I, a poor man, talked too much! I recklessly offended a rich man and now I'm going to lose my life! A few days ago, the Third Master of ×× Garden passed by here. As soon as he got on the boat, he kept urging me to row faster and faster, wanting to row to the other side in one go. I didn't recognize him, and his urging made me angry, so I said: 'Sir, don't be too impatient! Ferries have to be rowed paddle by paddle like this; if you want to be fast, sir, you better build a bridge yourself!' Heavens! Just one sentence caused trouble! That Third Master immediately went back and hired workers to build a bridge. You know, rich people can do anything! Look, isn't there already someone here surveying for him? As soon as the bridge is built, our livelihood will be over!"</p>
<p>I followed his finger and saw several people building scaffolding and surveying on both banks!</p>
<p>"But why didn't you go and beg them for forgiveness in the first place?"</p>
<p>"Did you need to tell me that, sir! As soon as I got this news, my whole family immediately rushed to kneel in front of the Third Master, knocking our heads and begging for forgiveness. But what's the use? That person was already very angry. He said: 'Our Third Master has lived a lifetime and never suffered anyone's anger, but today I have to suffer the bird anger of you ferryman! I will definitely teach you this bastard to break your dog food bowl...' I'm old, and I can still manage to row and rest like this over such a short distance every day, but I can't handle changing careers and doing something else... You tell me, isn't my family's life over this time?"</p>
<p>The tragic voice made me not have the courage to turn around and look at his face. I hurriedly went ashore and left.</p>
<p>………………………………</p>
<p>The bridge was finally completed. The first time I stepped onto that magnificent stone bridge, I thought of the aged ferryman. I looked around, although I could no longer see the ferryman and his old ferry, but I seemed to see a pair of eyes filled with despair and resentment, staring unblinkingly at the passersby at the bridgehead.</p>

<p>— Jun Jian</p>
<p>"There is an urgent meeting after dinner, all students are expected to attend," our hero C reported in the dining hall.</p>
<p>Half past six in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Students came to the auditorium one after another. Our hero C, guarding the entrance of the auditorium, with a heroic aura, watched every student who came in. Finally, Miss Li arrived gracefully. Therefore, hero C jumped onto the stage and announced the start of the meeting.</p>
<p>The chairman was of course our hero C.</p>
<p>"The purpose of today's meeting is to reduce meals and use the food expenses we save to buy airplanes to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army!"</p>
<p>"The Easterners have invaded... the Volunteer Army is fighting the Japanese in the wind and dew... We college students, although we cannot take up guns and directly fight Japanese imperialism, must share the hardships with the Volunteer Army... reduce the food to the minimum..."</p>
<p>Our hero, lectured for half an hour, with great passion, especially when Miss Li applauded.</p>
<p>"Reduce meals by two dollars per person," our poet W proposed.</p>
<p>"One dollar!" Fat T proposed.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Passed: Reduce one dollar per person from the monthly food expenses of seven dollars.</p>
<p>Lunch on Saturday.</p>
<p>Athlete L, who is going out for a competition in the afternoon, needs to eat his fill.</p>
<p>One bowl, two bowls, the dishes are gone. Athlete L pouted, Xiao Wang at the same table also seemed dissatisfied, and Mr. Hu wrinkled his brows.</p>
<p>"Reducing meals is completely making fun of us poor boys, so they can show off!" Athlete L slammed the table.</p>
<p>Everyone was not full, and they were all indignant, and together they glared at our hero C.</p>
<p>On C's table were scrambled eggs, ribs, and pickled mustard greens stir-fried with shredded meat. Humph!</p>
<p>Athlete L's eyes turned red, he ran to the side and grabbed our hero C's new tie, which he had just changed today, and roared:</p>
<p>""We want to share the hardships with the Volunteer Army in the wind and dew," good, hero, let's go to the Northeast together, it's useless to just sing high praises in front of the misses, let's go!"</p>
<p>Poet W panicked and tried to dissuade him:</p>
<p>"Today is because we were afraid that guests would come, so we added these few dishes, it's not that we are eating well because everyone reduced meals."</p>
<p>Fat T also came to persuade:</p>
<p>"Why pull ties and resort to violence, we are all college students, don't act like savages."</p>
<p>This storm finally calmed down within half an hour.</p>
<p>Our hero C's tie was not broken, but it was a little crumpled, but it was still beautiful, so he didn't change to a new one, and hurriedly went to the Shanghai Grand Theater with poet W and fat T, because he was afraid that Miss Li would arrive first and be angry if she waited too long.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Not Allowed to Think <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— E Jun</p>
<p>The first step in suppressing "reaction" is not allowing people to "move." The second step is not allowing people to "speak"; because speaking has the danger of inciting "movement," and if the "words" are written on paper, the danger is even greater. But the problem with speaking is that the brain will "think": so, in order to thoroughly suppress "reaction," it is necessary to not allow people to "think."</p>
<p>Now, the first step in suppressing "reaction" seems to have been successful. The second step is probably not far from success either. It's just that implementing the third step is a bit difficult. But we must not think that we will never think of it.</p>
<p>Today is the era of all-powerful science. Radio can send the speeches of important people to the ears of young masters and misses, and the shadow of the late detective novelist Conan Doyle can appear in photographs (see reports from last year). In the future, there may be a "Royal Scientist" who wins the Nobel Prize, racking his brains to invent a machine or a mirror that can capture the shadows of hundreds of millions of people and the secret thoughts hidden in their hearts, magnify them with a magnifying glass, and present them to the gentlemen who "uphold the Way." At that time, all demons and monsters will have nowhere to escape, and even those who appear upright but harbor evil intentions will be caught one by one and punished with the crime of "having bad intentions." In this way, everyone will naturally become good people obediently, not moving, not speaking, and also not daring to think. At that time, the country will be in order, the hunting dogs will be useless, and the gentlemen who "uphold the Way" will have no "Way" to "uphold," and they can just sit and hug beautiful women, leisurely and carefree, to pass the long days.</p>

<p>— Zhang Guiping</p>
<p>"Li Yixiang is out of his mind, pay him no attention..."</p>
<p>Haiquan knew that Tang Yaoxing was a disciple of Chen Huamin and seemed to have little faith in Li Yixiang. But Haiquan liked Li Yixiang's new poems, so he felt a slight antipathy towards Tang Yaoxing.</p>
<p>"Constructivist art is probably mechanist art."</p>
<p>Haiquan had once briefly skimmed a book on the theory of mechanist literature and art, so he brought it up to Yaoxing.</p>
<p>"Writing Wu Zetian as a revolutionary sister, supported by the masses. Is that considered Constructivist art?"</p>
<p>Haiquan saw that Yaoxing's attitude was so arrogant, and his question was irrelevant to the answer, so he was really unconvinced. But there was nothing he could do, so he kept quiet.</p>
<p>Everyone ate refreshments and chatted aimlessly for a while. Seeing that it was getting late, Chen Huamin stood up again.</p>
<p>"If you all have no suggestions or questions, then let's adjourn the meeting. However, before adjourning, I have a brief report. Starting next week, the S Society headquarters has decided to send Propaganda Minister Mr. Cheng to guide us in studying revolutionary theory. Once a week. However, the time and place cannot be predetermined. We will notify you temporarily at that time. This is the most important task. Please be sure to participate enthusiastically. That's all."</p>
<p>Haiquan hesitated a little after hearing this. He had originally joined this literary group to study literature and art, but he had not expected that this literary group would also entail many tasks, such as demonstrations, revolutionary issues, social problem studies, etc. He thought, even if there is no danger, it's too much trouble. But only for a moment, he reproached himself.</p>
<p>"Stand on the front line, don't be so unambitious in your thinking!"</p>
<p>He secretly encouraged himself and then bid farewell to them. When he walked to Li Yixiang, whom he had always admired, to say goodbye, Yixiang hurriedly pulled a pair of palms from his sleeves and tightly grasped his hand. Haiquan felt that Yixiang's hand had a warm and smooth feeling similar to that of a woman.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment, let's walk together. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."</p>
<p>Haiquan was truly flattered to be retained by this great writer, and he was indescribably happy. He hurriedly stood aside, watching Li Yixiang and another tall man whispering to each other. He also talked to those young people one by one, all using this set of formulas, first whispering for a while, then shaking hands, and finally laughing loudly, repeatedly saying, "I have a way, I have a way!"</p>
<p>Haiquan saw that Chen Huamin's attitude seemed to disapprove of Li Yixiang's actions, frowning and smiling bitterly with his thick lips, but he dared not say anything.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Finance: The Gold Market Is Mediocre and Unchanged <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Buying surged before closing, rising another ten yuan and two fen compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Spot goods continued to flood in from the North, and the swap premium dropped rapidly.</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, both near and far-term London prices narrowed by 1.25, New York silver prices narrowed by 1.25, Anglo-American exchange rates rose by 1.375, and long-term Anglo-American exchange rates rose by 1.4375, with forward silver prices even lower by more than 0.02. Bank private telegrams also fell by 1.25, and American cotton rose slightly by six pounds. The morning opening rose to 1085 yuan. The exchange market opened flat, so it failed to rise. Afterwards, banks tended to be tight, so downstream was seen. Sumitomo even offered April US dollars at 29.25 yuan. HSBC's listing did not change Anglo-American exchange rates due to exchange rate pressures. Gold prices retreated to 1080.5 yuan, and then rebounded. Although the exchange market was not good, it was still peaceful, so the gold market hovered a lot. When Sumitomo bought July US dollars at 29.875 yuan, it rose to five yuan. Before long, July US dollars at 29.8125 yuan were also difficult to settle, rising to 90 yuan. Zhejiang offered June US dollars at 29.5 yuan, forming downstream, and Shanghai even offered April US dollars at 29.125, falling to within five yuan. Hua Bi grabbed July at 875, so the noon closing was 1086.1 yuan. The afternoon market opened at 1086.8 yuan, extremely calm, only hovering around seven yuan. Transactions were minimal, and the whole market was boring. It did not pick up until after four o'clock, when Zhongfu, Hua Bi, and Shanghai all ate May 3125, and buying surged for a while, rising to 1091 yuan. However, the closing still retreated to the 90-yuan mark, at 1089.4 yuan. It can be seen that the market situation was mediocre and unchanged throughout the day. Except for a slight decline before the noon closing due to rumors of worsening relations between Japan and Russia, the afternoon market was even quieter. However, the speed at which the swap premium fell and the eagerness with which spot lots were dumped were truly astonishing. Spot goods continued to flood in from the North, even more so in the afternoon market. The boiled red price retreated from 33 yuan to within 30 yuan, and the swap premium has fallen to 16 yuan, which is truly unexpected. The trend is still weakening, as the short positions seem to be drying up. The market situation of the day is recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1085 yuan, up 5.8 yuan from the previous closing. Goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened flat. The recent asking price for the British exchange rate was one shilling, eight pence, three seventy-five, and the US exchange rate was 29.125 yuan. Initially, there were not many transactions, only Zhengjin sold April shillings at 4375 to Mai Jiali. Mai Jiali offered July 5625, so the gold market declined slightly. Zhao Fengchang came to sell, and it retreated from 5.5 yuan to 4.5 yuan. At this time, Dadecheng slightly advanced and was able to hold its ground.

Xiexingyong and Daxingyong sold at around 2.5 yuan. Hengxing came to advance to 3.3 yuan. Zhejiang also offered June US dollars at 19.6875 yuan, still forming downstream. Goods headgear suddenly came out to within two yuan. Yuan Maoyong bought in a limited amount, and Qian Changxiang advanced to 2.7 yuan. Fuyu sold off, and it retreated to within two yuan. The exchange market became looser. Sumitomo offered April US dollars at 29.25 yuan. Hengyu took the opportunity to sell off. HSBC's listing was announced, and both shillings and US dollars remained unchanged, so it retreated to 1080.5 yuan. Yuan Heng bought strips at low prices, gradually rising. Qian Changxiang even collected at around two yuan. Mai Jiali grabbed July US dollars at 29.9375 yuan, which were sold by Guohua. Hengyu advanced to 2.5 yuan.

After that, the trend turned for the better. Sumitomo grabbed July US dollars at 875. Hongli advanced sharply, reaching five yuan. Afterwards, July US dollars at 875 were difficult to settle. Hengxing suddenly came to advance sharply, and buying was strong for a time. Fuyu, etc., also came to compete for purchases, so it rose to 6.5 yuan. Goods headgear was sold to within six yuan. Retail investors pressed sales to around five yuan. However, due to Bingxing and Yuankangxiang collecting, it rebounded. Fuchang advanced again to 6.5 yuan. Shanghai continuously offered June US dollars at 625 and April at 125, struggling again. HSBC grabbed June US dollars at 625. Yiyu came up to drag in to outside seven yuan. July US dollars at 8125 seemed difficult to settle. Fuyu and Zhaofengchang, etc., competed fiercely to purchase. Mai Jiali also collected June US dollars at 5625, gradually adding to 1090 yuan. Zhejiang offered June US dollars at half a yuan. Xiexingyong sold off to within nine yuan. The situation hovered. After that, it suddenly became sluggish, because the exchange market did not show any tightening, and people's hearts were confused because of this. Yuantai sold slightly, but because there were no opponents in the market, it fell to within seven yuan. Fuchang also came to sell, and Shanghai offered April US dollars at 125, falling to 5.8 yuan. After that, although it still hovered between six and seven yuan many times, in the end, July US dollars at 8125 had no one willing to collect, gradually retreating to 4.3 yuan. Hua Bi grabbed July US dollars at 875 to even out. The closing then returned to 1086.1 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 6.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1086.8 yuan. Goods opened at 6.3 yuan, falling to 6.2 yuan. Retail investors then advanced, raising it to 6.6 yuan. Goods headgear then came out at six yuan. Shunli came up to buy in, rising to outside seven yuan. Yuan Shengyong advanced to outside eight yuan. However, because HSBC came out with June US dollars at 5625, it slightly retreated.

Yifengyong and Hengyu sold to seven yuan. Wanxing sold slightly, and it fell to 6.8 yuan. After that, there were not many transactions. The exchange market was also quiet. The market was extremely calm, hovering around seven yuan, with only one or two jiao of ups and downs. Most people were watching, so it was even more boring, and it lingered around 7.5 yuan. It did not pick up until after four o'clock. Xiexingyong advanced to 7.8 yuan, still retreating. When Bingxing came on the scene to buy, it added to outside eight yuan. Xiexingyong Hengyu further advanced to outside nine yuan. The market situation picked up. Zhongfu, Hua Bi, and Shanghai joined hands to eat May US dollars at 3125. Shengda also came to advance sharply, breaking through 90 yuan. Hengyu continued to collect, reaching 1081 yuan. Yuan Maoyong sold off, gradually returning down to 79.3 yuan. Before long, the closing was 1089.4 yuan. Many people sold off after the closing, and it retreated to around eight yuan. Goods were auctioned at nine yuan. It can be seen that the market situation was stable throughout the day. The highest price was 1091 yuan, and the lowest price was 1080.5 yuan, with ten yuan and five jiao of hovering. As a result, it rose 10.02 jiao compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The listed price, because HSBC Bank listed the price, and the US exchange rate did not move, was still calculated at 8.875, and the alloy price was 1154 yuan. According to the closing price, it was pressing approximately 64 yuan, less pressed approximately 10 yuan compared to the previous closing. The April bookkeeping price was 1108 yuan, May was 1086 yuan, the morning supplementary water was 1105 yuan, and the afternoon was 1108 yuan.</p>

<p>The boiled red market situation was uncertain. The initial opening in the market was calculated at 33.5 yuan. Yingfenghong sold to the silver shop gang. Afterwards, it was generally around 32 yuan. The situation was confusing. The afternoon market was even cheaper outside the market. The guest gang sought to sell 30 yuan without success. Dark market trading was once done at 9.5 yuan. Transactions were still strong.</p>
<p>The April-May swap premium was not cheap. Many transactions were made in the morning market. Only Hengxing stuck 42 strips to Yingfenghong, calculated at 19 yuan. The afternoon market was still quiet. Only Yichang once sought short positions, but there were no transactions because the premium did not match. Afterwards, spot lot Yingfenghong came to reduce the price of the swap. Initially, Dakang stuck 70 strips, and Futaiheng 14 strips, with the price calculated at 17 yuan. Finally, it fell to 16 yuan, still stuck in by Yingfenghong, which was stuck by Ruixing, with 84 strips traded. The trend was still downstream.

<p>Yesterday's exchange market was still mediocre. It was looser at first, and then barely improved due to the rise in the gold market. In the morning market, foreign telegrams showed that London's long-term forward rates had narrowed by 1.25, the Anglo-American exchange rate had risen by 1.375, and the Anglo-American exchange rate had also increased by 1.4375.

July US dollars, Macallie, ate 29.875, and then 8125, once difficult to settle. The noon market was slightly looser. Zhejiang stuffed out June US dollars at half a yuan. The afternoon market was extremely quiet. Banks slightly climbed up. Mitsui first climbed up July US dollars at 8125, but there were few transactions. Finally, it was slightly tighter.

By the close, the near-term asking price for the British exchange rate was one shilling, eight pence, three one two five, slightly tighter by 125 than the previous close, and the US dollar was 29 yuan, also tighter by 125 than the previous close.

<p>Yesterday was the end of the month and the day of the big billing, and the silver and money industry was very busy with collections and settlements. However, due to time constraints, we were unable to thoroughly investigate the exact figures. The trading of silver dollar drafts in the market totaled more than 3.2 million in the morning market and more than 300,000 in the noon market. There were more than 400,000 in the small general meeting. Silver draft trading totaled more than 4.9 million in the morning, noon, and small general meeting. The silver dollar discount rate was still 6%. There was no market price for drawing heads and adding water. All were done in plain draws. Finally, there were two to three points on the market. Remittance drafts amounted to 275,000 in the morning market and 1,100,500 in the noon market. Checks amounted to 90,000 in the morning market and 220,000 in the noon market.

Remittances from various routes amounted to more than 900,000. Customer route sources amounted to 300,000. Small money shop transactions amounted to more than 900,000. Subsidiary coins, Jiangnan small dollars, were 6 qian, 1 fen, and 6 li in the morning market and 6 qian, 1 fen, and 7.5 li in the noon market. The two markets were 1.5 li higher. Transactions amounted to 6,000 jiao in the morning market and 5,000 jiao Guangdong small dollars were 5 qian, 7 fen, 1 li, and 7.5 hao in the morning market and 5 qian, 7 fen, and 1.5 li in the noon market. Transactions amounted to 45,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao Copper coins increased by 1,000 wen to 427,000 wen.

<h3 id="e171">The Floor for Interest Rates in March <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>丨1.27丨</p>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the month. The total amount of interest for the entire month was calculated. Silver dollars were uniformly 1 tael, 2 qian, 7 fen and 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 7 fen. March was the first month to switch to dollar interest. The market's monetary conditions were very sluggish, so only a few points were opened each day, never reaching 1 qian or 1 jiao. Since the reorganization of the dollar standard, the balance of current account interest must also be listed in silver dollars. As for this interest rate negotiation, the floor is only 1.270, so calculating the monthly interest (31 days), it is only 4 fen and 2 li, so it is expected that the current interest rate will always be at 2 taels or 2 yuan and 95 kou. The unpaid interest will still be charged according to the existing code (4.5 taels or 4.5 yuan) added on, so the highest price will still be no more than 10.5.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Securities and Public Debt Trading Were Extremely Prosperous <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The evening closing did not even start. Various items rose by more than two yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere in the public debt market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was unusually tense and morale was high, a rare sight in recent times. The needs of various gangs were extremely high. At the initial morning auction, the price rose sharply from the 18-level. The demobilization of troops was especially strong. The highest price for the demobilization of troops was 56 yuan, a new high price this year. The remaining items also generally rose by 1-2 yuan. On the buying side, most of the new transactions were from powerful figures. The shorts did not hedge. In the second round, the shorts hedged slightly, and the longs also sold off slightly, so the 18-level, 20-level, 20-level, and May salt tax were all slightly better by about two jiao. The rest then returned a small three to five jiao, in accordance with the usual practice of rising greatly and falling slightly. The morning closing was made until 1:30 pm before it ended. Trading was quite prosperous, so the afternoon opening was delayed until after 4 pm before it started. There was not enough time to make another closing, so only one round of trading was done in the afternoon. The needs of the various gangs were still not weak, but there were also many longs selling off. The market price, except for the 19-level good luck and salt tax slightly returning three to five jiao, the rest still trended upward. The demobilization of troops closed at 55.8 yuan, up as much as 2.2 jiao from the previous day. The remaining items also rose by 8-9 jiao to two yuan. Major traders bought in, and retail investors slightly covered their shorts. Numbers 4, 14, 34, etc., advanced significantly in the market. The rest also sought more supply and less demand. The total number of transactions totaled 14,459,000 yuan, of which 4,000 yuan were spot goods, and salt and tax futures accounted for 5,980,000, demobilization of troops accounted for 2,185,000, and the rest ranged from over 200,000 to over 1 million.</p>

<p>丨Rumors of Yarn Factories Reducing Work Have Resurfaced丨</p>
<p>The yarn market trended upward and rose sharply, because yarn sales have been sluggish and delayed, yarn inventory has been increasing, and yarn factories have fallen into difficulties. Various factories in this port have proposed reducing work to maintain capital. Morale was suddenly excited, and the market trended upward. However, the factory is indeed scheduled to hold a meeting at 3 pm today to discuss everything, but the content is still kept secret.</p>
<p>(Human Standard Suddenly Rises by One Tael and a Half) The Human Standard opened in the morning market. It was heard that yarn manufacturers were calling a meeting to shorten work hours, which led to a surge in buying and a special rise in the market. Each month rose by one tael, six, eight, and nine qian. The afternoon market air was slightly softer, and each month fell back by one, two, and three qian. The total number of transactions for the day was 51,300 bales.

<p>The cotton market initially firmed and then fell, and the situation has become increasingly softer. This is because the global cotton industry situation is trending towards pessimism, Indian cotton is declining, and the calculated silver price is becoming cheaper. Dumping is becoming more intense, and there is a large amount of opening. As for American cotton, after the new president took office, there are still no adequate measures to maintain a certain level. In short, there is too much inventory, consumption is decreasing, and there are reports of new cotton fields increasing, so how can this cotton remain firm?</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Initially Rose and Then Fell) At the Zheng Standard opening in the morning market, the American and Indian cotton markets were flat, but the yarn market rose, attracting some bulls. Each month rose by 1.5 qian to 2-3 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that there was a large amount of Indian cotton opening, and morale suddenly loosened. Each month fell by 1-2 qian, and some manufacturers advanced Indian cotton and hedged Standard cotton. The total number of transactions for the day was 83,400 dan. It was found that Gengfeng sold 3,700 dan, Ruidong 2,600 dan, Yuande 2,400 dan, Chunjie 3,700 dan, Xincheng 5,500 dan, and Yuanxingchang 1,600 dan.

<p>(Jinan) Yesterday's supply was from the 10th to the 20th. Urban and rural stores slightly bought in bulk, also handling over a thousand piculs. However, looking at the overall situation, although the outflow is still good, there is an appearance of slackness.  The rice prices of the Su Tong gang and Qing Jiao Nan Gang gangs have stabilized.  Du Yang Jian and Yin Yuan still have no change in price, but Ai Yuan's outflow is sluggish, and the price is slightly lower.</p>
<p>(Jibei) Yesterday, there were more than 30 rice boats from various gangs on the river.  The turnover of white japonica rice was still slow and the market appeared soft again.  There was a considerable arrival of thin japonica rice, and retail sales were average.  Tianjin handled 500 to 600 piculs, and the price remained firm.  Medium and lower grades were closely aligned with the near-term price.  Yang Du Jian arrived and sales were moderate, and the market was stable.  Bu Ke Jian also appeared flat, and Yin Yuan was stable at 100 yuan.</p>

<p>Guest Xian Rice Continues to Arrive in Three Boats    Foreign Rice Enquiries on the Street</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Fujian gangs continued to actively handle guest xian rice, and the appetite was very strong. In addition to handling Hunan rice, they also initially handled a batch of Jiangbei guest xian rice. In this street, besides handling 300 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice, they also sold a small number of Jiangbei xian rice and Saigon No. 1 and Small Jiaoxi, 200 bags each. The Saigon Small Jiaoxi had a large gang outflow in the middle of the month, and the market was very good. Recently, the wholesale of spot foreign rice has been quiet, and there have been transactions in futures, but there is still a lot of stock, and the market price is slightly lower by 10 to 20 cents compared to the last sale price. The market opened with 200 bags of Small Jiaoxi at a price of 7 yuan and 65 cents, 200 bags of Saigon No. 1 at a price of 8 yuan and 20 cents, and 1,400 bags of Jiangbei guest xian rice at a price of 6 yuan and 90 cents, which is also 20 to 30 cents lower than the previous opening. More than 1,000 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice were sold at a price of 8 yuan, 37 cents to 42 cents. In addition, 507 bags of unpolished red rice were sold at a price of 7 yuan and 60 cents, 120 bags of machine-milled Jing rice were sold at a price of 7 yuan and 60 cents, 100 bags of unpolished Jing rice were sold at a price of 6 yuan and 70 cents, 429 bags of coarse Jing rice were sold at a price of 6 yuan and 55 cents, 250 bags of machine-milled oil rice were sold at a price of 8 yuan, 70 cents to 8 yuan and 50 cents, and 300 bags of coarse oil rice were sold at a price of 8 yuan, 91 cents to 8 yuan. Transactions were active and the market should have been optimistic, but more than 6,000 new bags arrived, loaded by the Jianghua, Qingpu, and Xianghe boats, and the market price was pulled down by 3 to 5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Flour and Wheat Delivery Completed <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>No Single Bag of Flour Delivered    One Cart of Spot Wheat Delivered</p>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the month, the delivery period for flour and wheat futures. There was no market for futures in any month. Spot flour was drawn by various gangs from Beiyang and Nanyang, 3,000 to 5,000 bags each. In addition, there was a batch of wholesale, which was for the end-of-month delivery at the exchange. There was no single bag delivery in the exchange. Only one cart of standard wheat was delivered at the end of the month. In addition, there were 2,000 tons of spot foreign wheat, which was directly offset by dealers and factories. Therefore, the delivery in both exchanges was quiet. In the Grain Exchange, besides one cart of wheat, there were only two carts of yellow soybeans and two thousand pieces of soybean cake.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Yellow Soybeans Have Outflow to Guangdong and Fujian Gangs <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the appetite of the Guangdong and Fuzhou gangs for the soybean market was very strong, causing the market sentiment to be quite active. However, because the current inventory has not loosened and the circulation is still important, the market remains stable. The Fuzhou gang purchased more than 800 bags of Sha yellow soybeans, priced at 3 taels, 7 mace, 8 candareens to 3 taels, 7 mace, 6 candareens, and more than 480 bags of Du soybeans, priced at 3 taels, 8 mace, 5 candareens to 8 mace, 2 candareens. The Guangdong gang purchased 50 bags of large-grain Du soybeans, priced at 4 taels and 3 mace, and more than 360 bags of medium-grain soybeans were sold at a price of 3 taels, 8 mace, 7 candareens to 8 mace, 4 candareens. A total of more than 970 bags of Sha yellow soybeans were sold at a price of 3 taels, 7 mace, 9 candareens to 7 mace, 6 candareens. The source of cart soybeans has been received, and the factory appetite is still weak. Yesterday, two carts of Zhengyangguan soybeans were opened, priced at 3 taels, 8 mace, 2 candareens and 8 mace. Two hundred and fifty bags of Nansuzhou soybeans were sold at 3 taels and 6 mace, 2 candareens, and one cart of Wuhe soybeans was sold at 3 taels and 6 mace to inland cart workshops.</p>

<p>▲High-Grade Jujubes Sell Well▲</p>
<p>Relatively sluggish, the current market price of Lanxi bald jujubes is slightly looser, selling at 36 to 37 taels, but the top-grade inventory is most scarce, and sales are increasing, so the price has not been increased as usual, and the top-grade large jujubes may be over 40 taels.</p>
<p>(Jinshan Branches) There has been a lack of continued arrivals recently, and the inventory is getting thinner every day. Quotations are more firmly defended, so the asking price has risen again. Yesterday, it was heard that more than 200 boxes were opened in the North City, with top-grade flat branches opened to about 38 taels, top-grade round branches at 30 taels, and ordinary branches at 24 to 25 taels, which is an increase of 2 to 3 taels compared to before.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable due to the slight rise in the standard gold price and the slight increase in the Dutch exchange rate. The guild made a full market offer of 15 taels, 2 candareens and a half for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar. There were no increases or decreases in No. 20 and No. 18 medium granulated white sugar and No. 8 and No. 9 Dutch red sugar, but there were not many complete sets. Quotations such as Chaoqing full-weight top-grade ice white sugar were still not opened. A few hundred bags of ordinary Hainan red sugar were opened yesterday, priced at 14 taels and 3 mace. Due to the weather, sliced green sugar will not last long, and it was heard that there was a secret loosening of the quotation to 22 mace. The factory's refined white sugar was slightly opened, priced at 14 taels and 3 mace. Only a dozen boxes of Xingbing's green hand goods were opened, the higher ones were 12 taels and 2 mace, and the lower ones were 11 taels and 9 mace.</p>

<p>Herringbone tweed, which was popular a few years ago, is now very popular for making suits. Herringbone floral tweed, herringbone Hanling tweed, herringbone Sumi, herringbone spring overcoat fabrics, etc. are all popular and sell well. Tailors and piece goods dealers all have transactions. The selling price is also better than other patterns. N绒 stores in the Qipan Street area, which make mass-produced goods, are also starting to order and sell them. Herringbone Huat tweed, which is used for making Chinese clothing, has also arrived recently, but in small quantities, so it has sold out in two weeks. The opening price for the first batch was 3 taels and 3 mace, and the second batch was 3 taels and 1 mace and a half. At present, there are still many buyers who need it, but unfortunately there is no stock available. It is expected that the new goods from foreign firms will arrive in a month.</p>

<p>Researching radio is most important to experiment, and you must have materials for experimentation. In the major trading ports, it is not difficult to purchase materials, but in remote areas outside the port, mechanical materials are often not easy to purchase. This publication is to provide convenience for those who are interested in research, so we have specifically investigated the products of various companies. Anyone who wants to purchase radio parts or needs materials, please list the required situation in detail and send a letter to the Radio Weekly Department of Shen Bao. We will contact on your behalf and give you detailed price and content replies. So that you can remit payment directly to the company for purchase. When purchasing, if you state that you are introduced by this publication, you can get preferential treatment. It is also okay if you want to entrust this publication to purchase on your behalf.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Choosing a Radio (3) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Xiong</p>
<p>Choosing a radio requires examining your own needs. Now, let's analyze everyone's needs first:</p>
<p>(1) Amateur Research. Since it is research in nature, you can choose any radio, from crystal sets to the latest and most complex long and shortwave radios, without any problem.</p>
<p>(2) For Individual Use. This refers to listening with headphones only. Near the broadcast station, you can purchase a crystal set, but it is also limited to places where there are not too many broadcast stations and the radio waves do not interfere. It is not possible in Shanghai. A single-tube regenerative receiver can be used farther away from the broadcast station. For even greater distances, add high-frequency amplification. If you want louder sound, you need to add low-frequency amplification.</p>
<p>(3) For Family Use. This does not require excessive loudness, as it will disturb neighbors and cause resentment. It is enough for the whole family to be able to hear. You can add two stages of low-frequency amplification to the level that can be heard individually, or use the new pentode tube for amplification.</p>
<p>(4) For Public Use. This requires a rich volume of sound, so it is convenient to purchase a ready-made radio.</p>
<p>(5) For Travel Use, or Mobile Use. Because you cannot install a ground and antenna, you must choose a good radio.</p>
<p>Secondly, the power supply must also be given considerable consideration. Crystal sets do not require a power supply, so it is unnecessary to say, all vacuum tube radios must have a power supply. In remote mountain villages where there is no electric lighting, it is necessary to use dry batteries for everything. In some places, there is electricity at night but no electricity during the day, so storage batteries can be used to supply A power. If there is electricity day and night, you can use an AC radio.</p>
<p>The electricity from electric lighting factories in various places is either direct current or alternating current. You cannot use an AC machine with direct current, and you cannot use a DC machine with alternating current. Even with alternating current, the voltage is different, some use 110 volts and some use 220 volts. Therefore, before purchasing, you must consider it carefully.</p>
<p>There are many types of radios sold on the market today, and lecturers often struggle to choose. But these radios each have their own unique points, such as being cheap, sounding good, being easy to carry, or having authentic sound. We cannot strongly point out which is superior and which is inferior. However, if you can purchase according to the local situation and your own needs, it will be both economical and convenient. In the future, when I have time, I plan to give a brief analysis of the characteristics of various radios on the market and which ones are suitable for which situations.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Principles and Transmission of Micro-Wave Radio <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>A few months ago, this newspaper had a piece of news saying that the International Telegraph Company successfully tested micro-wave radio telephone from London to Paris. It also said that the antenna of this shortwave transmitter is less than one inch long, and the number of vibrations per second can reach 300 million times.</p>
<p>This type of shortwave is O Quasi Optical Sboitwave, and all wavelengths from 10 meters to several centimeters belong to it. Therefore, its wavelength is close to the wavelength of light waves. The generation of this shortwave uses vacuum tubes. However, its wave generation method is different from ordinary ones, because it uses Electron Oscilfation. What is electron oscillation, please see Figure 1:</p>
<p>Figure 1: Filament F passes current and generates electrons due to heat, but the grid G surrounds F and is charged with high-voltage positive electricity, so the electrons generated by F are attracted by G. At the same time, because the area of ​​G is extremely small, most of the electrons are not absorbed by it but pass through the grid holes and proceed to the screen P which is charged with a higher negative voltage. But at a certain point Figure 2</p>
<p>, due to the repulsion of the same polarity, the electrons are rejected and returned. The dotted line in the figure indicates the path of electron travel. Because the number of cycles of electrons being attracted and repelled per second is extremely high, it is used as electron oscillation. The simplest electron. The simplest electron oscillation circuit is shown in Figure 2.</p>

<p>V is 99 or 27. All vacuum tubes with cylindrical screens are applicable.</p>
<p>AA is a copper tube used to install the antenna.</p>

<p>Other things such as wavelength meters and receiving circuits cannot be described in detail due to space limitations, and will be described in another article when I have time.</p>

<p>— KP</p>
<p>丨The discoverer of Ohm's law丨</p>
<p>Ohm (Geory Simon Ohm 1787-1854) was a German physicist, born in Erlungon on the upper reaches of the Main River in southern Germany. In 1817, he served as a professor at the Jesuit University of Cologne. In 1833, he became a professor at the Nuremberg Higher Industrial School. In 1852, he became a professor of experimental physics at the University of Munich, and later died in Menz. His writings are mostly about the theory of current, especially Galvani sche Kette Mathematisch Bearbeitet, published in Berlin in 1827, which is the most famous. Ohm's law, which shows the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance, was discovered by him. Therefore, the unit of resistance is called "Ohm" to commemorate his contribution. Ohm's theory of current is very similar to Faraday's theory of heat conduction. If we use temperature in Faraday's theory as potential and current as sound flow, then it can be said that it is completely the same as Ohm's theory.</p>

<p>(2) Low Sound</p>
<p>The sound of the radio gradually becoming low is a common problem and also the most annoying problem. If this problem is not cured, how disappointing is it?</p>
<p>Now I will tell you the inspection method and handling method for this problem:</p>
<p>Phenomenon       Reason          Handling Method</p>
<p>The sound naturally gradually decreases       Vacuum tube aging          Apply the "revival method" or replace with a new one</p>
<p>Crystal is insensitive         Replace with a good one or explore other contacts</p>
<p>High consumption resistor is defective      Replace with a good one</p>
<p>Battery voltage decreases       Charge</p>
<p>The resistance at the connection is too high    File the overweight connection</p>
<p>The ground and antenna are defective      Pay attention to inspection and repair</p>
<p>The sound is sometimes high and sometimes low  The voltage of the electric light wire supplying B power changes (AC)  For those with tap terminals on the power transformer, replace them.</p>
<p>The sound does not change at all when the antenna is removed    The antenna connection is poor or there is a break in the lead-in wire or the ground wire connection is poor       Pay attention to inspection and repair</p>
<h3 id="e190">Experience <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>A Once-and-for-All Improvement to Single-Wire Antennas</p>
<p>Ordinary lead-in wires are probably wrapped around or soldered on the antenna. After a long time, they are prone to loosening. If a small part is left on the length of the antenna itself as the lead-in wire (see figure), then it will not change no matter how long it takes. Moreover, reducing the length of the antenna can also increase selectivity, which is especially needed in Shanghai, where there are many broadcast stations.</p>
<p>Wind-Resistant Movable Pull Wire</p>
<p>If the antenna pull wire is too tight, it is easy to be blown off by the wind. If it is too loose, the efficiency will be reduced and the appearance will not be good. It is best to pass the pull wire through a pulley and hang an iron hammer of appropriate weight below. In this way, the iron hammer can automatically adjust the tightness of the antenna.</p>
<p>A Burnt Vacuum Tube Transforms into a Vacuum Tube's Lifesaver</p>
<p>Soak the burnt-out or old and useless vacuum tube in boiling water. After a few minutes, the glass tube can be detached. The remaining rubber tube can be used to install a small electric bulb of considerable voltage (see figure). During testing, insert the rubber tube into the lamp holder before inserting the vacuum tube to measure whether the filament voltage is misconnected. This can avoid many unexpected losses.</p>

<p>— Jin Yunqiao</p>
<p>(2) Multi-Wire Type: Or when the environment is not suitable for installing a single-wire type, a multi-wire type can be used. Two or three wires of equal length can be installed in parallel according to the single-wire method. The length of each wire should not be shorter than 10 meters, and the distance between each wire must be more than one foot. The capacitance of this type is larger than that of a single wire.</p>
<p>(3) V-Shaped Type: It is excellent for places where the location is cramped. This type has two directions in one wire, and the number of radio stations that can be received is more than that of a single direction. The lead-in wire is best connected to the corner of the V-shape.</p>
<p>(4) Cage Type: According to actual experiments, the resistance of this type is smaller than that of the flat-top type, and the efficiency is better. However, it is troublesome to install and few people use it. The height is about 20 meters and the length of each wire is about 25 meters.</p>
<p>(5) Umbrella Type: This type is mostly used in large radio stations to enhance the scattering ability of radio waves.</p>
<p>(6) Filter Type: This type is based on the transformer principle.</p>
<p>,(as shown in Figure 2) 1 is the center wire, which can be made of 18-gauge fabric-covered wire. Its function is similar to the primary coil of a transformer. Both ends are grounded to form a large loop. 2 is a finer enameled wire of 300 feet, surrounding the outside of the center wire, just like the secondary coil of a transformer. The electric wave is induced into the center wire and then induced into the outer antenna coil, plus the second Figure: Lead-In Wire Ground</p>
<p>the voltage of the electric wave induced by the antenna coil itself, so the received sound is stronger than that of an ordinary antenna.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned types of outdoor antennas, there are also L-shaped, fan-shaped, loop-shaped, T-shaped, and other types, all of which are named differently due to their different forms. Due to space limitations, I will not list them one by one. The overhead wires of electric lights can also be used as antennas (as shown in Figure 3). 1 is any wire of the electric light, which is used as an antenna (two wires can also be used together, but two fixed storage capacitors must be installed, or one wire can be used as an antenna and one wire can be used as a ground wire, both are acceptable). 2 is a switch or a knife switch, 3 is a fixed capacitor, and its capacity is about 0002MF.D. It must be able to withstand Figure 3: Ground Wire</p>
<p>high voltage, otherwise there is a risk of burning out. However, it is best not to use electric light wires as antennas because there are many dangers.</p>
<p>(B) Indoor Antenna (1) Loop Type: This type uses a cross-shaped wooden frame (or metal frame) and wraps several turns of insulated copper wire to form a square or rectangle, or other geometric shapes are also possible (as shown in Figure 4). The length of an ordinary parallel antenna is longer than that of a loop type, so the capacitance is larger, but the inductance is smaller. It must be equipped with a relatively large induction coil. Because the loop antenna is wound into a loop, although the inductance is larger, its sound reception ability is far inferior to that of an outdoor antenna.</p>
<p>A loop antenna is just an enlarged version of a coil. The distance between each turn is proportional to the inductance. The closer the distance, the greater the inductance and the fewer the number of turns should be; the farther the distance, the smaller the inductance and the more the number of turns should be. For ordinary loop antennas that receive 200 to 500 meters of electricity, if the length of the wooden frame from A to B and from C to B (see Figure 4) is 20 inches, and the distance between each post is 10 inches, 16 turns is enough. If the distance is a quarter of an inch, 14 turns can also be used.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Wireless Radio Knowledge (5) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>(5) Ohm's Law</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are some conductors through which electricity flows easily, and there are some through which it does not flow easily. This is because conductors have different resistance to current. Metals are generally good conductors of electricity, so they are also called good conductors. On the other hand, there are many substances through which electricity can barely flow, but the resistance is very high, which easily weakens the current. These are called poor conductors. As for many substances such as glass, porcelain, and oil, their electrical resistance is so high that current cannot pass through them, so they are called insulators. Various machines are actually ingenious combinations of good conductors, poor conductors, and insulators.</p>
<p>Then, what is the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance?</p>
<p>If the water pressure is high, the water flow is large, and the resistance is large (for example, using a thin pipe to pass water)</p>
<p>It can be said that it is directly proportional to the water pressure and inversely proportional to the resistance. Current</p>
<p>, and inversely proportional to the resistance. If we use a formula to express it, it is as follows</p>
<p>Current (Amperes) = Voltage (Volts) / Resistance (Ohms)</p>
<p>Ampere is the unit of current, Volt is the unit of voltage, and Ohm is the unit of resistance (please refer to the article "Units of Electricity" published in this publication). It is common to use I to represent current, E to represent voltage, and R to represent resistance. So the above formula becomes</p>
<p>I = E / R</p>
<p>This formula was discovered by the German Ohm (please refer to the "Figures in the Radio World" in this issue), so it is also called Ohm's Law. This law is a very important basic principle for us to study electricity and radio. It is applicable to both alternating current and direct current. From this law, we can design various machines (of course, there are also more complicated formulas). It means that if a voltage of E volts is applied to a conductor with a resistance of R ohms, a current of one ampere can be obtained. If the voltage is doubled, the current will also be doubled. If the resistance is doubled, the current will be halved. If we change the above formula into an algebraic formula, then (1)</p>
<p>E = IR</p>
<p>This means that in order to pass a current of I amperes through a conductor with a resistance of R ohms, a voltage of E volts must be applied. Also (2)</p>
<p>R = E / I</p>
<p>This means that if a voltage of E is applied to both ends of a conductor and the current flowing through it is I amperes, then the resistance of the conductor is R ohms. Using this formula, we can calculate the ohm value of the filament resistor (Rbeostat) of a vacuum tube radio. For example, the UX20IA vacuum tube only requires a filament voltage of 5 volts and a current of 25 amperes. If a 6-volt storage battery is used, the voltage is one volt higher and a resistor must be used to reduce it. So</p>
<p>R = E / I = (6-5) / 0.25 = 1 / 0.25 = 4 Ohms</p>
<p>This means that the resistor must be at least 4 ohms. If a 6-ohm bleeder resistor is used, it is very safe.</p>

<p>If the wooden frame is reduced to 16 inches on each side, with each turn a quarter of an inch apart, there are 16 turns. If they are half an inch apart, there are 20 turns. With a 0.0005 M.F.D. variable capacitor, its center Ding to Wu should be at least 8 inches apart. Although a loop antenna with a smaller area is easy to carry, its effectiveness is inferior.</p>
<p>A loop antenna has directivity. When its plane is opposite to the power station, the received electric wave is the strongest, and when it is at right angles, it is the weakest. The direction finder used on ships is also made according to this principle. There is also a complex loop antenna, which has a small loop inside a large loop, and is used in special circuits (to be continued).</p>
<h3 id="e193">Units of Electricity (3) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>

<p>(4) Unit of Resistance</p>
<p>The strength of an electric current is related not only to the magnitude of electromotive force but also to the type and shape of the conductor. The current generated from the same battery (i.e., equal electromotive force) will be stronger if a copper wire is used as the conductor than if an iron wire is used. If the same type of conductor is used, the current will be stronger if the shape is shorter and thicker than if it is longer and thinner. This property of the conductor, which impedes the current and reduces its strength, is called Resistance, or impediment. Each conductor has a certain resistance. The unit of resistance is called the Ohm, or simply Ohm. One Ohm is the resistance presented when the voltage across a conductor is one volt and the current intensity is one ampere. In practice, it is equal to the resistance presented by a mercury column at zero degrees Celsius with a cross-section of one square millimeter and a length of 106.3 centimeters to an unvarying current.</p>
<p>Resistance is represented by the letter R in formulas.</p>
<p>Two other units are used to measure larger or smaller resistances:</p>
<p>Megohm (symbol MU): one million ohms</p>
<p>Micromho (symbol MU): one millionth of an ohm</p>
<p>(1) One UX tube socket, one RCA232 or other equivalent brand vacuum tube</p>
<p>(2) One UY tube socket, one RCA233 or other pentode vacuum tube</p>
<p>(3) One set of ordinary three-circuit coils</p>
<p>(4) One .00035 variable capacitor</p>
<p>(5) One .00025 fixed capacitor</p>
<p>(6) One .2 Meg grid leak resistor</p>
<p>(7) One .00025 fixed capacitor</p>
<p>(8) One 250,000 ohm resistor</p>
<p>(9) One .005 fixed capacitor</p>
<p>(10) One 2 Meg grid leak resistor</p>
<p>(11) One .002 fixed capacitor</p>
<p>(12) One 6-ohm variable filament resistor</p>
<p>(13) Two dry cell batteries for A-battery filament use, voltage not to exceed two volts</p>
<p>(14) One 135-volt B-battery set</p>
<p>(15) One 13.5-volt C-battery set. This number is used when listening to the radio with a speaker. If you want to listen with headphones, the plate current is too large and the coil can easily burn out. The C-battery should be changed to 22.5 volts, or the B-battery should be changed to 90 volts before it can be used.</p>
<p>Also, it should be noted that the top electrode of the tetrode vacuum tube used as a detector is the grid, and one of the tube feet corresponding to the usual triode grid position is the screen grid, which should be connected to 22.5 volts of B-battery. The position diagram is attached below for reference by those who have not used tetrodes and pentodes.</p>

<p>▲Recent News from the Jianhua Company Repair Department The radio repair department of Jianhua Company at 393 Avenue Foch in this city has been established for nearly a year. It has served the community and has gained considerable reputation. Now, in order to improve the repair department, it has purchased a variety of repair instruments from Europe and the United States, so that inspection, repair and delivery will be exceptionally fast. In addition, if there are any difficulties with the radio, it will be sent to the department for inspection free of charge, and any questions about radio will be answered in detail.</p>
<p>▲The Third Batch of Orders from the Jianhua Company Retail Department Has Arrived The retail department of Jianhua Company at 393 Avenue Foch in this city has always adhered to the principle of small profits and quick turnover. All kinds of radio materials are directly ordered from famous European and American factories. Radio materials can be said to be all-inclusive, such as plastic panels, dials, loudspeakers, headphones, variable capacitors, fixed capacitors, wiring, antennas, etc., with a wide variety of styles. Those who want to purchase are welcome. The company has also added a battery manufacturing department. The latest product is the Jianhua brand dry battery. It is said that both A-batteries and B-batteries are available, with sufficient materials, beautiful styles, durable and inexpensive.</p>
<p>▲King of Portable Radios Marconi is recognized as the inventor of radio. Recently, he also supervised the production of a portable radio, which is extremely convenient to use. It can be used to listen to music on trains, cars, rickshaws, and ships; it is especially suitable for military use. It is said that since the machine arrived, many people have gone to buy and visit it. The showroom of the machine is located at 2 Beijing Road. Whether you buy it or not, you are welcome to visit.</p>
<p>▲Philco Six-Tube Radio Has Arrived in Shanghai The Philco brand radio, produced by Philco Company, 96 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, is the most reliable and valuable radio on the market. If you buy it, you will be satisfied. The latest six-tube machine, first produced in 1933, has now arrived. All major electrical appliance stores and record stores in this city are selling it. The price is 265 yuan per unit. It is said that the sound of the machine is loud and the separation is clear, and no other machine can match it.</p>
<p>▲Notice to Those Who Repair Radios Radio receivers, on the surface, are extremely simple, but internally, the crisscrossing circuits and the arrangement of all parts, and various sounds, are all different. Those who buy radio receivers find it difficult to understand its structure at once. If the parts are damaged, hurriedly disassembling them will often make the repair more difficult, or even damage the parts. Therefore, the repair of radio receivers must be presided over by people with rich academic and practical experience in order to be competent. There are really not many complete repair shops in Shanghai. In view of this, the Yada Company at 25 Renji Road in this city has specially hired Mr. Xu Zhifang, the former chief engineer of the Kailuo Company and Wheeler Company, to specialize in repairing all kinds of complex radio receivers. Mr. Xu has served in the radio industry for more than ten years, and has rich knowledge and experience. With the purpose of serving the community, he provides a slight effort for those in all walks of life who have radios and encounter difficulties. The company's repair department can guarantee the use after repair, so the business has been quite prosperous recently.</p>
<p>▲China Radio Research Institute Ships Canadian Brand Radio The China Radio Research Institute has newly shipped four-tube and five-tube Canadian brand radios. The machine uses the latest Alcia light bulbs and the famous Qin Sheng broadcast loudspeakers. The structure and style are exceptionally beautiful, the sound is particularly clear, and it can also play records. The selling price is extremely low. There are also various types of five, six, and seven-tube dry cell DC radio receivers, all produced by famous British and American factories. Visitors are welcome. The machine is currently on display at the Jiaotong University Exhibition in Xujiahui. The business department is located at 314 Continental Arcade. Telephone number is 93390. The factory is located at 21 Shencheng Lane, West Inces Road.</p>
<p>▲Innovation of Marine Radio Equipment The Dahua Radio Company at 9 Sanma Road, Shanghai, is most famous for its marine radio equipment. The major steamship companies in this city, such as Sanbei, China Merchants, and Zhengji, all have their major steamship radio equipment installed by this company. It is said that the company has a latest product that concentrates all the machines on a single steel frame to facilitate equipment in a smaller room. The construction diagram is as follows.</p>
<p>Charging Section Shortwave Section and Vacuum Tube Section Longwave Section</p>
<p>The upper part of the machine on the left is the charging hub main control box, which is separated by a layer of rigid asbestos board to prevent overheating. The middle part is the main part of the shortwave, and the position of the hollow tube. The lower part is the main part of the long wave, and all the silver bar wiring is very strong, and the structure is very sophisticated. The large steamship radio equipment installed has unobstructed news day and night. It is truly a guarantee of maritime safety.</p>
<p>▲Homemade Radio Broadcasting Machine for Sale Amateur radio enthusiast Mr. Yang has made a five-watt broadcasting machine, which has been tested and has a loud sound within 30 to 50 miles. It has been tested in major theaters for three months, and the results are remarkable. Recently, I am willing to sell it at a low price because of the Shanghai Highway. Those who want to speak should contact Mr. Li Tinghou of Dahua Radio Company at 9 Sanma Road.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Features of the Stewart 106 Radio (Continued) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenzhi</p>
<p>○ Squelch Circuit</p>
<p>○The connection between the squelch circuit and the suppression of noise between stations is as follows. If a radio has only an inter-station noise suppressor, it will not completely eliminate the high-pitched strikes of static electricity. If the sensitivity of the radio is reduced to the point where it can completely eliminate static electricity strikes, the result will inevitably be that the radio waves of all the powerful stations in this city will also be completely expelled.</p>
<p>The function of the squelch circuit is to limit the radio to receiving only sound signals above a certain predetermined intensity, and to isolate all sound signals or static noise below this intensity. The curve in Figure 2 shows the volume of a sound signal on an ordinary radio as it gradually tunes in to the point where it gradually tunes out. This line rises from point A, where there is no sound at all, to point B, where it is loudest, and gradually decreases to point C, where there is no sound at all. If the radio uses a Q-circuit, a completely different result can be obtained when it tunes into a certain station again. At this time, the sound received appears suddenly at point D. There is no hissing noise before the sound appears. If we continue to tune, we can hear this sound signal proceeding along the DBE curve. When it reaches point P, the Q-circuit immediately shows its function again, suddenly cutting off the weak hissing sound below it.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that another feature of the Q-circuit is that it can obviously improve the selectivity of the radio, because the sound signal from the station now tunes in only to the FG section, unlike an ordinary radio, which must be the entire AC section. If the Q-circuit is used in conjunction with the inter-station noise suppressor, it is not necessary to excessively weaken the sharpness when tuning between two stations, because the cut-off effect of the Q-circuit will effectively prevent the intrusion of static noise and various noises.</p>
<p>Here we must note that because of the existence of this Q-circuit, a new obstacle may occasionally occur, but this is easily eliminated. Suppose there is a very weak station at one point controlled by the inter-station noise suppressor, and its highest sound signal cannot exceed the length of the DF line in Figure 2, then the Q-circuit will receive the high-pitched part of this sound signal and cut off its weaker sounds, making the sound signal received a suffocating sound. The method of preventing this is very simple, just slightly increase the power of the inter-station noise suppressor, and then the sound signal will be clear and without obstacles.</p>
<p>Delayed Automatic Volume Control</p>
<p>In the past, in ordinary radios, when they received broadcasts from any station, whether the station was strong or weak, the automatic volume control function would immediately exert its function. This device could weaken the power of the low station sound signal to the point where it could not be heard.</p>
<p>The feature of the 106 model is that it can prevent the automatic volume control from working on the sound signals of weaker stations, because it is not necessary. However, if a station is encountered whose volume is extremely large and sufficient to supply full output, this automatic volume control will immediately show its effect. Even if ordinary radios have extremely convenient automatic volume control, there is often a fading phenomenon when receiving sound signals from weaker stations. This delayed automatic volume control can reduce this drawback. (The End)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Member of the Central Committee Fu Rulin arrived in Nanjing by Jinpu train on the morning of the 1st, and paid visits to Wang and Chiang to report on the work in North China and to discuss matters. Fu said that the center of the war of resistance against Japan had shifted from the various passes of the Great Wall to the Duolun area of Chahar Province. Our army has a tight line of defense of about thousands of miles from Chahar to Gubeikou and other important passes. The national army and the volunteer army can already cooperate with each other. The so-called preparation in the past was actually preparation for retreat. This time, it is a real military preparation. The enemy's spying is to cut off our route to Hooling, a commercial port with Russia. We have already seen through their plan, and Minister Huang Shaoxiong has gone to inspect and make considerable preparations. The enemy's plan, although cunning, is not worth worrying about. Feng Huanzhang's remarks are extremely radical on the issue of resistance to Japan. The date of going south has not yet been determined. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) All weekly publications are now paying attention to the impact of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations on the military preparations of "Manchukuo". The Bystander newspaper said that if "Manchukuo" is an independent country as Japan claims, it should be equipped with an army, and especially suitable is a navy. However, if Japan supplies its protectorate with warships and its warships exceed the limits set by the London Naval Treaty, a very serious situation will arise. The New Statesman newspaper predicted that Japan would demand an increase in armaments for itself and "Manchukuo" at the Disarmament Conference. The Fortnightly Review predicts that Japan will realize that it has fallen into an isolated predicament, and its ever-expanding military budget will cause serious concern among domestic clear-headed economists. The Saturday Review said that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations has damaged the League of Nations' power in the Far East. Japan may be forced to continue the armed defense of "Manchukuo", but its withdrawal from the League of Nations will not lead to war. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e220">Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai This Morning to Discuss the Central Government's Early Promulgation of the Constitution <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Abolish the Provisional Constitution and the Guidelines for Political Tutelage, Return Political Power to the People</p>
<p>The Government's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged, Hoping for Unity to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, along with legislators Ma Chaojun and Fu Bingchang, left Beijing by train at around 11 p.m. last night and arrived in Shanghai at 8 a.m. this morning. Xin Sheng She reporters visited Mr. Sun at his private residence on Columbia Road this morning. Mr. Sun stated that the Central Government has decided to convene the National Assembly early, promulgate the Constitution early, open up political power, and return it to the people. Mr. Sun also stated that the Central Government's foreign policy remains unchanged and hopes that the whole country will unite and mobilize to resist Japan and defend against foreign aggression. A detailed record of Mr. Sun's remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>(Opening Up Political Power) (Reporter asked) Does the Central Government's decision to open up political power mean abandoning one-party rule, or does it mean returning the power held by a few to the majority? (Mr. Sun said) The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee resolved to convene the National Assembly in April of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Now, it has been decided to hold it earlier and promulgate the Constitution early. However, this issue still needs to be decided by the National Congress in July of this year. There is no such thing as opening up political power, because the Constitution has already been promulgated early, and the Provisional Constitution and the Guidelines for Political Tutelage established by the Central Political Council during the period of political tutelage have become obsolete. The government has returned political power to the people. Since political power is jointly owned by the people, there is no such thing as opening it up. (Asked) Will one-party rule be abandoned at that time? Should the Constitution explicitly stipulate that the people are allowed to freely establish political parties? (Answered) Since the Constitution has been promulgated and the people have freedom of assembly and association, then the establishment of political parties is also permitted by the Constitution. There is naturally no need for explicit provisions in the Constitution.</p>
<p>(Participation in Politics) He also said that the organization of the National Political Council is currently under review by the Legislative Yuan. Now that the National Congress has been brought forward to July, deciding on the issue of convening a provisional National Assembly, the National Political Council is no longer necessary to convene, because the National Assembly is the highest organ of the government, and the National Political Council is only a popular opinion organ during the transitional period. If the National Assembly is convened early, the Constitution must of course be promulgated early, and its drafting period must also be shortened. As for the organizational law and election law of the National Assembly, the principles can be roughly decided by the Central Political Council next week.</p>
<p>(Unity to Resist Aggression) The government has no diplomacy to speak of with Japan. Ambassador Jiang has also been recalled. From now on, diplomacy will only be possible if we can resist Japan. This consistent policy has not changed. Currently, the Central Government's anti-Japanese military efforts are focused on consolidating positions. If we attack, we can recover lost territory. If we defend, we can maintain existing territory. Otherwise, we will not even be able to defend, let alone attack. Therefore, unity is a prerequisite for national mobilization. To achieve this goal, we must also reform politics and increase strength. What we regret most now is that China is not a purely unified country. Government orders cannot reach the borders, local autonomy in the provinces has not been completed, and there is a gap between public opinion and the government. Therefore, the majority opinion advocates: (1) Concentrating and uniting national public opinion, convening the National Assembly early, promulgating the Constitution early, and opening up political power. (2) Reforming politics so that the central government and the provinces can work together effectively and strictly adhere to discipline. (3) Implementing local autonomy and communicating public opinion. Only when these three things are accomplished can we have the strength to resist Japan. Otherwise, everything will be empty talk and of no practical use.</p>
<p>(Hoping for Feng Yuxiang to Go South) Mr. Sun finally said that the Central Government has hoped that Feng Yuxiang would go south since last year. There have been exchanges of letters and telegrams, and people have been sent to Zhangjiakou to urge him. I estimate that Feng should be able to take on considerable responsibility, but the title has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>The Propaganda Department Issues a Notice of Temporary Boycott. The Paris International League Also Boycotts German Goods</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, March 31. Dr. Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda, announced on the radio tonight that the National Socialist Party's movement to boycott Jews nationwide, which began at 10 a.m. on Saturday, will end that evening. However, if the "cruel propaganda" made by overseas Jews does not completely cease, the boycott movement will resume on April 5. According to Goebbels, the "cruel propaganda" of overseas Jews has greatly declined recently, indicating that the National Socialist Party's boycott intimidation has been effective. He also claimed that German Jews have the absolute power to restrict or stop "cruel propaganda." Goebbels concluded by saying that if it is necessary to resume the boycott on April 5, the way it is implemented will be enough to destroy the Jewish people throughout Germany. "However, we want to get along with the world. We want to work and do not want to make enemies for no reason." The National Socialist Party's stormtroopers are actively carrying out the anti-Semitic movement. Although today is not yet the day of implementation, they have already begun to act, excluding all Jewish judges and lawyers from the Berlin courts. Shortly after, the National Socialist Party headquarters ordered non-Jewish employees of Jewish businesses to pre-pay two months' salary and to demonstrate against their Jewish owners outside their stores at 3 p.m. on Saturday. At the same time, non-Jewish store owners were ordered to immediately dismiss their Jewish employees, but Jewish owners were not allowed to dismiss their non-Jewish employees. The National Socialist Party headquarters is now appointing commissioners to punish Jewish owners who disobey. The National Socialist Party is also imitating the methods of the Middle Ages, ordering all Jewish shops to hang large black and yellow signs outside. The police chief of Altona even ordered the words "Jewish Business" to be added to the sign. Various slogans are now posted throughout the country, such as "International Jews must now admit that they cannot turn Germany into a colony of Soviet Russian criminals," and denying the various acts of anti-Semitism, also stating "Overseas Jews are at war with the German people," blaming the Jews in Germany. Schleicher published a radical article in the newspaper, saying "Since the Jews started this war, this war must continue until the Jews admit that the Germany governed by the Brownshirts is not comparable to the Germany governed by cowards." The passports of important Jewish figures have now been cancelled to prevent them from leaving the country.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, March 31. The boycott of Jews will end on Saturday night. Outsiders see this as the Germans having recognized that a long-term boycott will inevitably lead to economic chaos. The cessation of the boycott must be due to the advocacy of the National Socialist Party members in the cabinet. Many people believe that this anti-Semitic movement is not entirely a self-defense action in retaliation for the "cruel propaganda" made by overseas Jews. The main reason is that the extreme elements of the National Socialist Party have been advocating anti-Semitism for many years and have never had a chance to do so. Therefore, the leaders of the National Socialist Party intend to use this action to vent their anger. Whether this appeasement policy will be effective is still in question. All sectors of the Jewish community are deeply concerned that once the boycott movement begins, it will be out of control. Although the leaders of the National Socialist Party want it to end that evening, they fear that they will not be able to restrain the party members in time. Therefore, Goebbels' speech did not alleviate this panic.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Berlin, March 31. Deputy Minister of Finance, a Jew named Seton, resigned today. There are now no traces of Jews in the public service of the federal government and the Prussian ministries.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Berlin, March 31. Stormtroopers of the National Socialist Party occupied the Court of Appeals in Königsberg, prohibiting Jews from entering. Only a few Jewish lawyers are allowed to settle lawsuits for their co-religionists, but only if those lawyers can prove that they fought on the front lines during the European War.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, March 31. The International League has decided today to begin boycotting German goods as a retaliatory measure against the German Socialist Party's anti-Semitic movement. The League's boycott of German goods will begin tomorrow at the same time as the Socialist Party's anti-Semitic movement. All those who have ordered goods from German merchants have cancelled their orders. At the same time, a committee to protect abused Jews has been organized, and many leaflets and slogans are being printed.</p>

<p>(Havas, Astende, Belgium, March 31) The great German scientist Professor Einstein and his family are temporarily residing nearby.

<h3 id="e224">British Finances Are Sound <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, March 31. The British annual revenue and expenditure statistics were released today, showing the sound position of the British budget. Revenue totaled £744,791,000, while expenditure, including the £17,250,000 allocated for debt repayment reserve, totaled £748,124,000, a shortfall of £3,323,000. In addition, the £28,956,000 paid to the US in December for war debts brought the total deficit to £32,279,000. Since last July, Britain could have received £30,250,000 in Allied war debts and reparations owed to Britain, calculated at the current exchange rate, and another £7,250,000 in war debts from overseas autonomous territories, totaling £37,500,000, to offset the debts owed to the US. However, according to the Lausanne Agreement, reparations and war debts are temporarily suspended until the Lausanne Agreement is ratified or a decision is made not to ratify it, resulting in Britain's expenditure exceeding its revenue. If all debts owed to Britain since last July had been paid as usual, the British budget would have had a surplus of £5,250,000. The budget did not include revenue and expenditure items such as reparations and war debts, only projecting total revenue of £766,800,000 and total expenditure of £766,000,000, which included a debt repayment reserve of £32,500,000. In terms of actual revenue, income tax and surtax collected £312,200,000 last year, £13,750,000 less than budgeted. Property tax collected £66,000,000, £1,000,000 more than budgeted. Customs duties and excise tax collected £288,000,000, £12,000,000 less than budgeted. Various loans exceeded the budget by £6,250,000. On the expenditure side, the original plan was to pay £276,000,000 for debt principal and interest, and £32,500,000 for the debt repayment reserve. As for the repayment of US debt, it is found in the Ministry of Finance's report as another item in the annual financial statement, indicating its special nature. The British government is entitled to consider the payment of this sum as a repayment of capital, which should be regarded as part of the final repayment in the future. Last year, in addition to paying US war debts, Britain actually paid £262,250,000 for debt principal and interest, and another £17,250,000 for the debt repayment reserve. In addition, £2,655,000 was paid for interest on savings bonds, which were repaid with loans. The allocation of the debt repayment reserve was lower than the amount projected in the budget, which was due to the impact of the high market price of national bonds after the wartime bonds were exchanged. The Ministry of Finance previously allowed the Bank of England to continue issuing £15,000,000 in banknotes without cash collateral. This right to issue banknotes will expire tonight, and the Bank of England has not requested to continue to enjoy this right. Therefore, the issuance of this credit currency will be reduced from £275,000,000 to £260,000,000 to match the total amount of legal tender when Britain suspended the gold standard in September 1931.</p>

<p>▲Havas, London, March 31. It is generally known that Polish Foreign Minister Beck recently told the British Ambassador to Poland that the Polish government had not received formal notification of the Anglo-Italian talks, so it seemed that no comment should be made on the draft Four-Power Treaty. However, the Polish government believes that this draft is contrary to both the letter and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, and therefore declares in advance that any resolutions adopted by a group of great powers organized on the basis of Italian proposals cannot bind Poland.</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Expanding American Banking Panic <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>(Second Letter) (March 1)</p>
<p>The Michigan Banking Crisis Creates a New Banking Panic. All government and Federal Reserve Bank countermeasures to quell the banking panic have been ineffective. The panic is spreading like wildfire and is expanding daily. Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Iowa, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Florida, Arkansas, Missouri, and California have all been engulfed in the vortex of the panic. Fourteen of the forty-eight states in the United States are now in a state of panic. More importantly, the panic has directly approached New York and is directly threatening Wall Street, the fortress of the gold kings.</p>
<p>On February 25, the government of Maryland announced that all 205 banks (with a total capital of 88.9 million gold dollars) would be allowed to restrict withdrawals, because the total amount of money withdrawn in the state in the past week, only 13 million gold dollars, was a very small number and had shaken the Baltimore banks. This is a signal indicating the extreme weakening of the banking situation, a signal indicating how dangerous this situation is, a signal indicating why hundreds of banks were forced to close due to small initial disturbances.</p>
<p>On February 27, the banking panic continued to expand. All deposits in Cleveland (Ohio) and Indianapolis were only allowed to withdraw 5 percent. All savings deposits were suspended for 30 days. Five banks in Akron (Ohio) with a total of 65 million gold dollars in deposits and 100 million gold dollars in capital were only allowed to withdraw 1 percent of deposits per month. Banks in Lima (Ohio) implemented restrictions on payments. Banks in Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Missouri were also forced to close.</p>
<p>Great efforts were made to rescue the 500 banks in Michigan that were in a state of panic. Ford (Henry Ford) was not forced to rescue his private banks until he was under the greatest pressure. He had been watching for a long time. His main reason was that, in his view, the entire banking system in the United States was bound to collapse. But in the end, he decided to reorganize the capital of his private banks and increase it to 8.25 million gold dollars. However, this number was relatively small, because the "Finance Reorganization Association" (RFC), a national rescue agency, had paid out 78 million gold dollars, the Federal Reserve Bank had paid out 20 million gold dollars, and the Chicago Bank had paid out 20 million gold dollars to cope with the payment of 30 percent of the deposits.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Washington government, with lightning speed, promulgated a decree giving the "Monetary Standard Supervisor" the power to prohibit the withdrawal of deposits from national banks. All 6,150 banks that complied with the Federal Reserve Bank's regulations were included in the list of those not allowed to withdraw deposits. But whether this bank commissioner with such great power can be effective if he does not have new and greater sums of money for rescue is still a big question.</p>
<p>It is now very clear that all the work of the Finance Reorganization Association in rescuing banks has not been successful. As early as January, 348 banks had already experienced panic. The number of banks forced to close and restrict payments in February must be over 1,000. The Finance Reorganization Committee carried out rescue work last year and is also engaged in this work now, but the current rescue work requires the state to give it tens of millions of dollars. However, if the state pays such a large sum of money at this time, it cannot but cause a serious danger to the monetary standard.</p>
<p>In this way, the banking panic once again raises the issue of the monetary standard sharply. The new generation of people centered on Roosevelt seem to want to maintain the gold standard. But all their explanations are not enough to prevent the depreciation of the gold dollar. If the banking panic continues to expand and new assistance is needed, it is still a question whether the government will not be forced to change its view of the monetary standard. For the time being, the government is still supporting the monetary standard without assisting the banks.</p>
<p>However, it is not impossible for the monetary standard to become unsustainable with the continued sharpening of the banking panic.</p>
<p>Although economists continue to try to obscure the international significance of this new panic, they cannot but admit that this American banking panic is a new start to the capitalist world panic, and is a start on a higher basis. Now we only need to study the shocks that the American banking panic has already caused and will inevitably cause in the entire international credit transactions to know its international significance.</p>
<p>On February 26, the Berliner Tageblatt expressed its support for Pinrell, saying that the dream of "the end of the panic" has now been awakened. "The galaxy in the world economy, which had previously given important light to the Papen Plan, has now dimmed. The extreme rise in raw materials last summer soon subsided. People have long known that the American panic is a volcanic eruption, and now they see this dangerous disease reappearing."</p>
<p>The capitalist economic panic cannot but affect the political status quo. The fantasy of the United States canceling international debts has now been shattered. The competition of mutual slaughter in the world market is extremely sharpened. Imperialist conflicts will soon turn into world wars.</p>

<p>Organizing Anti-Japanese Support Groups from All Walks of Life, Merchants Voluntarily Sealing Inferior Goods</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Various agencies and organizations in Fujian believe that Cai Tingkai is about to lead the anti-Japanese armies of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces northward. The people of the country should rise up to provide support. They have initiated the organization of the Fujian Anti-Japanese Support Association. The Pacification Headquarters, Provincial Government, Provincial Party Headquarters, Public Security Bureau, County Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Women's Association, Money Trade Association, and 15 other agencies and organizations have been appointed as committee members. Starting from March 27th, they will begin working at the Provincial Party Headquarters, deciding to mobilize donations from April 1st to 3rd. The donation methods are divided into four types: A. Mobile: Donating to the public and passersby, undertaken by teams from various schools, each team consisting of ten people. B. Fixed: Donating to households and shops, organized by teams from various agencies, assisted by personnel from the local fire brigades. C.

It is expected that the public will enthusiastically donate.</p>
<p>The people of Fuzhou have always been very strict about boycotting inferior goods. However, since the Zheng Weixin case occurred last November and the Elimination of Inferior Goods Association was dissolved, the work of boycotting goods has been relaxed, and inferior goods have been imported in a steady stream, flooding the market. Silk, Su-Guang products, seafood, hardware, and Western medicines are the most popular. Now, various merchant guilds, in view of the increasing Japanese military attacks on North China and the impending national crisis, some merchants with a sense of righteousness have suddenly awakened and convened a joint meeting of representatives of various trade guilds on March 24th. It was decided that starting from the 26th, all inferior goods stored by various guilds should be sealed up within three days and prohibited from being sold. Anyone who dares to violate this will be publicly denounced and their shop names and names will be published in the newspapers for society to deal with. Fearing that the police might misunderstand the situation and repeat the tragedy, representatives of various trade guilds visited Qiu Zhaochen, Director of the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital, on the 25th to explain that this boycott movement was purely voluntary by the merchants and requested assistance. Qiu replied that within the framework of the law, he would provide full support. The various trade guilds have dispatched investigators yesterday to go to various shops in the guild to identify all inferior goods and seal them up. (March 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e232">Yao Rebellion in Guangxi Province Pacified <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Communist Bandits Inciting Yao People to Riot, Yao People's Flags All Red, Large Army Advances and Quickly Suppresses</p>
<p>Nanning Dispatch: Lingchuan, Xing'an, Quanyang, Yining, and Longsheng counties mostly have Yao ethnic groups living together. In a place called Longji at the junction of Xing, Ling, and Long counties, in mid-February, Yao people gathered there numbering several thousand, building a temple to propitiate the gods, falsely claiming to support the Yao king of Quanyang to restore Yao and destroy Han. The Yao people often fantasize in their minds, believing that a Yao king will emerge from Quanyang soon. In the past, the Han and Yao people had an unusual harmony, and at the end of the year, they would give each other pork to show their amity. However, this was not done last year, and the Yao people have recently been making knives and building projects, not allowing Han people to interact with them. All Han people passing through here are inspected. Their organization is extremely strict. The Yao people are inherently ignorant and easily incited by communist bandits, so a major riot occurred, spreading to Yongfu and Xiuren areas. Therefore, although the Yining County Magistrate sent Deng Puren and Zhao Tingjian to the Yao side to enlighten them, it was all ineffective. Later, a communist bandit leader named Su fled from Jiangxi and caused trouble in Yuancun, Quan County. Of the nearby Han and Yao villagers, seven or eight out of ten were instigated by him to join. At that time, the Yao people claimed to have tens of thousands of people and posted absurd and bizarre announcements. Thus, the Yao people besieged Xing'an City, which was the beginning of the Yao people's riot. After this incident occurred, the local county governments sent telegrams asking for troops to suppress and investigate. The Fourth Group Army Headquarters ordered Division Commander Zhou to order the 57th Regiment to send three companies of troops to the area to suppress, one company to Longsheng, and the remaining two companies, led by Commander Zhang, to Xing'an area to suppress and handle according to the situation.</p>
<p>As for the suppression process, according to a telegram from the Xing'an County Magistrate, the reports from the 3rd, 5th, and 6th districts under the county found that the Yao people on the border of the county abandoned production and gathered for meetings, drawing knives, wearing rings, and running around wildly, with various disturbances, suggesting that someone was inciting them. The district chiefs repeatedly advised them, but they turned a deaf ear. In addition to strict prevention, further reports will be made, hoping for attention. Also, Zhang Gan, commander of the Guilin District Militia, led a team to Xingquan area on February 18th to investigate. According to Zhang's telegram, the Yao situation in various places is as follows: "Gan arrived at Mazidu and met with County Magistrate Huang, Mr. Jiang Bowen, and Deputy Commanders Qin and Tang. He immediately took the phone and listed the information obtained: (1) County Magistrate Huang reported that the Yao bandits had surrounded the Jieding Village in Jiukaitian. At noon, Yao occupied Xiandong Dayuan. The Yao bandits are taking an inch and wanting a mile. The situation is serious. (2) County Magistrate Tian reported that the Yao bandits attacked from Dengjia Village at midday. The militia is weak and retreated to Litou Market, a few miles from the county town. There were many casualties on both sides. The district commander was injured in a conflict. (3) County Magistrate Chen reported that the Yao bandits of Mujiang went to the Wuxiang Village to plunder. They were attacked and fled by the police. The situation in Wuquan, Niushi, is unknown. Lehua Long has arrived in the county town and ordered the company back to Wuquan to restrain the Yao people from joining the Tongmujiang Yao rebellion, and to persuade the Yao to wake up and not believe in rumors or be manipulated by the communist bandits. Otherwise, they will be suppressed, and explain the reason why the Yao people can be harmed by treasures. Liang has obeyed the order and is working hard to comply. (4) According to the above situation, the Yao rebellion in Xingquan has begun. It is not yet possible to predict whether the Yao of Guan will join the rebellion. It is difficult for the peace to succeed. According to County Magistrate Tian, Division Commander Zhou has added a company of troops, which will arrive in Xing by car tonight. The three parties of Xingquan and Guan are very urgent and must be suppressed with force. Gan intends to ask Division Commander Zhou to add two battalions and a machine gun company, distributed in Xingquan, to suppress them at the same time. The Yao are now rushing out of Xing, and may cross Xingcheng, intending to form a piece with the Yao in Longxingquan and the border of Hunan. If so, then increase a battalion of troops with machine guns each, and go straight to Xiangmujiang bandit nest in Quan Jianxiang, so that it can escape to Xing, and attack from both sides, and the effect can be expected. It is not easy to advance into Dengjia Village Shankou, but Jianxiang is easy to attack." Also, the Xing'an County Magistrate telegraphed, saying that the Yao bandits in Dengjia Village, numbering more than 2,000, rushed fiercely at our police, and many police were killed or injured. The six soldiers left by Commander Zhang were also killed or injured. Now the guns and bullets are lacking, and there is no way to resist. They can only temporarily retreat to Moyuan Village, five miles from the city. The bandits are still approaching. Please send a large team of cars to rescue them.</p>
<p>Chen En yuan, deputy division commander of the 19th Division, rushed to Xingquan to suppress the rebellion after receiving urgent telegrams from various parties, and first sent four companies of soldiers, one company of mortars, and two companies of machine guns, to Xinglong on the 22nd. The Yao bandits were a motley crowd, lacking in equipment, and upon hearing that Chen had led a large army to suppress them, they knew they could not resist, so they fled back to their lair in a panic. Chen is now implementing both suppression and pacification, sending troops to suppress while also announcing the government's good intentions to engage in pacification. At that time, some Yao people had already come to their senses and were not incited by the bandits, willing to surrender their weapons. The Yao crowd gradually disintegrated. The 19th Division headquarters sent troops to suppress them, achieving a great victory. The Yao bandits suffered countless casualties. It was heard that the Dongshan Yao in the Quan area were searched and suppressed by government troops, and their main force was attacked and dispersed. Thus, the Yao rebellion was pacified.</p>
<p>Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, seeing that the Yao rebellion was pacified, telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Council to report, saying, "The Yao people in Quan County, Xing'an, Quanyang, Yining, Longsheng, and Lingchuan counties in Guilin have recently been gathering to rebel in various places under the pretext of building temples and carrying gods. Repeatedly sending personnel to pacify them was ineffective. Recently, the Yao people in various places have gathered about four or five million people. The flags and symbols are all red. The weapons include knives, spears, powder guns, and rifles and pistols. They are using 'Revive Yao and Destroy Han' as their slogan, threatening and luring people wherever they go, absorbing strong men, or carrying out massacres. The Yao on the borders of Hunan and Guizhou are rising up in response, and the situation is very turbulent. It has been confirmed that there are important communist party members presiding over it. Considering the communist party's conspiracy to harm Guilin, using the Yao people to provoke fighting between Han and Yao people as a starting point, the false CCP member Wei Baqun has poisoned Dongfeng for many years with the slogan of 'Keeping Yao and Killing Tu'. Fortunately, he was killed last year. This time, the party is using the same method to instigate the Yao people in various places in Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi to launch a large-scale riot, attempting to disrupt the border between Hunan and Guangxi. We should extinguish it as soon as possible to avoid great trouble. We have sent Army Commander Liao to supervise five regiments of troops and the Guilin District Militia to be responsible for the suppression. Now we have broken several bandit nests. The remaining small groups have also been repeatedly defeated by the army. In addition to ordering the troops to collect weapons, eliminate the ringleaders, and disband the coerced from the defeated bandits, we will properly arrange the aftermath to ensure that the case is concluded as soon as possible, and we will submit the details in a separate document. We respectfully report for your review, and hope you will check. Li Zongren Bai Chongxi report."</p>

<h3 id="e234">Liao Chengzhi Released on Bail Last Night <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Still Subject to Legal Trial</p>
<p>Liao Chengzhi, son of martyr Liao Zhongkai, was arrested by the Zhabei Police on the 28th of last month for suspected communism and sent to the Higher Second Branch Court. After two interrogations, he was transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau along with the evidence yesterday. Liao's mother, He Xiangning, and CCP member Liu Yazi bailed him out at midnight yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Released on Bail Last Night) After the Higher Second Branch Court ruled yesterday to transfer Liao Chengzhi to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, he was taken back to the Public Security Bureau for detention by Inspector Lu of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday evening. Liao's mother, He Xiangning, has been bedridden recently due to her concern for her son. She struggled to get up and was helped downstairs upon learning that her son had been transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. She went to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau with CCP member Liu Yazi and lawyer Wu Kaisheng to visit her son. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau then agreed to release him on bail. Liu Yazi and He Xiangning provided bail. By about 11 pm, all the procedures were completed, and Liao Chengzhi was released and returned to his residence to rest with his mother.</p>
<p>(He Xiangning's Statement) He Xiangning told the Central News Agency reporter this morning that since her son Chengzhi was arrested, the military and political authorities, considering the friendship of her late husband Liao Zhongkai, have been running around to rescue him and secure his release on bail. She expressed her gratitude. However, her late husband Liao Zhongkai always held the spirit of universal love. She deeply hoped that the military and political authorities would, considering Liao's past friendship, rescue the political prisoners of the country with the spirit of rescuing Liao's descendants, so that they could work together to overcome national difficulties and save China from crisis.</p>
<p>(Liao Chengzhi's Statement) He then introduced her son Liao Chengzhi to meet the reporter. Liao recounted the process of his arrest, saying, "I have only returned to China from Germany for over a month. On the 28th of last month, I was ordered by my mother to go to No. 9 Wufu Lane, Shanxi Road, to meet tea merchant Ouyang Chun to order tea leaves to be transported to the Northeast to comfort the soldiers on the front line. However, as soon as I entered, Ouyang was not there, and I was arrested by the inspectors of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and detained in the Zhabei Police. It was not until yesterday that I was transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. I was released last night after Mr. Liu Yazi and my mother bailed me out. As for myself, I have always not known what communism is, and I have no political affiliations."</p>
<p>(Trial According to Law) According to a responsible spokesperson of the municipal government, regarding the Liao Chengzhi case, because Liao's mother, He Xiangning, was concerned about her son and bedridden, she was allowed to post bail and be summoned at any time. Yesterday, Liu and He were responsible for posting bail. As for this case, Liao Chengzhi is only suspected, so he will still be transferred to the responsible authorities for trial according to law to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Police Find Communist Propaganda Cloth <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Containing More Than 161,000 Words, But Chen Shuying Insists It Is Not Hers</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that the Special Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police recently cracked a communist party organization in the Settlement and discovered a large number of hidden documents. After applying chemicals, the handwriting was revealed. It appears to be the complete documents of the General Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, i.e., the National General Labor Union. The organization was located upstairs in a cigarette paper shop at No. 290 Mei Bai Ge Road. The occupants were Chen Guang and his wife, and Chen's younger sister, Shuying. Chen Guang and his wife have escaped, so only Chen Shuying was captured. At the time of the arrest, detectives found many white willow cloth and white paper in her room. Afterwards, they applied chemicals to a handkerchief found in the room and discovered the principles of communist propaganda in the Kuomintang army written in Chinese. Then they took several pieces of white willow cloth and applied the same chemical experiment, and all had handwriting. Among them were communist leaflets, notices, and books, and instructions on how to fire machine guns and throw bombs in the sky. There were 43 pieces of cloth, about 27 inches wide and 43 feet long. It is estimated that each foot has 3,750 characters, so 43 feet have more than 161,250 characters. The end of each section is written with the type of content. Except for a few leaflets on the Shanghai Memorial Day and the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the rest are records of the Communist Party's activities in Manchuria, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Fujian, Qin, and Henan provinces. In addition, 38 copies of "Red Flag Weekly" were seized, the earliest of which was published in December 1931, and the most recent of which was published on March 8 of this year. It is said that the cloth contains a true record of the work of the National General Labor Union in the past two years. Also found in the room were a large number of white paper and light yellow paper, and many blank exercise books, all of which are thought to have handwriting. Chen Shuying, who was arrested, speaks Russian and insists that the items seized by the detectives were stored by her father's friend, surnamed Yu.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Establishes Donation Collection Office for Northeast Relief <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Based on the Requests of More Than 70 Associations</p>
<p>Entrusting Banks and Money Shops to Collect Donations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce decided at its 32nd Standing Committee meeting yesterday to establish an office for raising donations to aid the Northeast, appointing Luo Qinghua as the director of the office, and appointing banks and money shops as collection points. At the same time, it issued a declaration, the text of which is as follows: "Since the Northeast has fallen and the volunteer army is fighting bloody battles in the remote areas, the Chamber has taken the initiative to organize a Northeast Refugee Relief Association in conjunction with all sectors. Now, according to the request of more than 70 associations such as silk-rayon weaving industry, this monthly donation is actually made by the business community. In order to rectify the name and define the responsibility, and to arouse the business community's sense of self-awareness and responsibility, it is appropriate to take sole responsibility and eliminate dependence. This is in line with the ancient saying of 'not shirking responsibility' and achieving the practical effect of 'turning stubbornness into integrity.' It is proposed that the Chamber form a Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Donation Raising Committee for National Salvation, etc." The Joint Executive and Supervisory Committee referred it to the 32nd Standing Committee meeting for discussion. According to the requests of various industries, it issued a declaration and established the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Donation Raising Office for Northeast Relief in the Chamber, appointing Committee Member Luo Qinghua as the director of the office, and designated the Bank of China, the Salt Industry Bank, the Silk Industry Bank, the Tongchun Money Shop, the Hengxun Money Shop, the Siming Savings Society, and the Chamber's Finance Section as collection points. From now on, there will be a dedicated person in charge. All merchants should save money and food and help the country in difficulty, striving to be pioneers in all walks of life. This is a special declaration. (New Voice)</p>

<p>Union Petitions for Withdrawal of Detectives, Requests Mediation for Early Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute at the Nanyang Tobacco Company, because the company's detectives have not yet withdrawn, and eleven staff members of the office are afraid of being arrested by the factory, they have not yet returned to the factory to resume work. This morning at 11:00 AM, the Nanyang office again petitioned the Party and government. The Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union separately submitted a petition to the Party and government for an early mediation. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Staff Petitions: The Nanyang office of the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, because the company's detectives have not yet withdrawn and they fear being arrested again if they resume work, specifically dispatched representatives Xiao Guangde, Zhang Hua, Wu Shiyuan, Yu Xingqing, Xu Zhubao, Weng Lin, Zhou Jian, Xu Ronggen, Wang Yunsheng and others this morning at 11:00 AM to petition the Party and government, requesting early mediation and asking them to order the police station to withdraw the detectives. The Social Bureau was met by mediation director Wang Xianqing, who expressed that the Bureau had already reported this to the Municipal Government and was awaiting the Municipal Government's notification to the police station to handle it. They then went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to submit the same petition, where they were met by Zhang Sheng, the chief of the Civil Training Section, who stated that the proposed prerequisites were still under consideration and promised to coordinate with the Social Bureau to schedule a mediation.</p>
<p>Union Submission: The Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau yesterday, stating that it was a petitioning matter. The Nanyang office of the Union, in order to request the signing of labor-capital prerequisites, unwillingly experienced a strike on the 20th of last month. The factory falsely reported to the police station, arresting five staff members and workers from the office and transferring them to the court. Staff member Wu Shiyuan and worker Li Jingfa were tried and released on bail last Tuesday. The rest are still in custody, with the trial rescheduled. The factory's behavior of wanting to arrest the staff and conduct security measures has been negotiated by the union and bureau who have jointly sent personnel, who agreed to withdraw it, but this has not yet been implemented. It is only appropriate to submit a document to once again petition your union and bureau to quickly transfer a notification to the police station, withdraw the armed detectives from the factory, and also request a prompt mediation to maintain the livelihood of the workers. This would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Man and Woman Walking Side by Side <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly Spotted by Chief Inspector Quan, Identified as Old Man Xu San</p>
<p>Quan Lin, Chief Inspector of the Anti-Bandit Command on the Su Song Waterways, was passing through Rehe Road yesterday afternoon when he saw a middle-aged man from Anhui Province walking side by side with a young woman from Jiangbei. Chief Inspector Quan believed the man was the notorious Old Man Xu San, who was a wanted bandit. He had committed crimes such as kidnapping for ransom and armed robbery in Suzhou in August of last year. Three of his accomplices had been arrested in Suzhou, and Xu was on a wanted list issued by the Anti-Bandit Commander Xu Ke. He then reported to No. 787 Chinese police officer, who arrested the man and woman together and took them to the police station. Under questioning by the police chief, the man denied being Old Man Xu San, and claimed his name was Yang Baohua. The young woman claimed to be Yang Chenshi, Baohua's wife, and said that the couple had come to Shanghai from Zhenjiang just half a month ago and were renting a place at 457 Kaifeng Road and were currently looking for work, and had no history of crime. However, Chief Inspector Quan insisted that the man's surname was indeed the wanted bandit Xu, and since the woman was the bandit's wife, she was also an accomplice. He presented the secret order given to him by the commander as proof. The police chief then ordered the man and woman to be detained separately and sent to the First Special District Local Court this morning. Judge Qian Wenji conducted a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the situation and stated that if the inspector wanted to request a transfer, he should be ordered to provide substantial evidence and the command should have a formal transfer document before the transfer could be approved. Judge Qian immediately instructed Quan Lin to do so in accordance with these two points, and ordered the man and woman to be detained separately, rescheduling the hearing for a later date.</p>

After reviewing the situation, it was deemed necessary to amend and supplement them. Therefore, in October of last year, a draft of the Rules for Electricity Business Operators Handling Electricity Theft was re-drafted, and opinions were widely solicited from relevant agencies and experts from various locations. It was compiled, reviewed, and revised into sixteen articles. This new regulation has been decided and promulgated by the Construction Committee at a meeting on January 6th of this year and is scheduled to take effect from April 1st, according to the New Life News Agency.</p>
