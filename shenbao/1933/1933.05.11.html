<p>時評</p>
<h3>華盛頓談話與中國信</h3>
<p>華盛頓談話會。始於英首相麥唐納。法前總理赫理歐赴美與羅斯福交換意見以後。决定被邀赴會者。有中德意坎拿大等十一國。并决定不採取外交上圓棹會議形式。由各國代表分别與美總統晤談我國則由現任財長宋子文化表東渡新大陸。現已安抵華盛頓。與美總統面談一次矣。其談話内容。據路透社所傳甚略。但就此簡單之數語窺之。已不難推知其大概。即東方經濟市塲關係爲最重大。而東北四省被侵事。乃居次要地位也。</p>
<p>在美國立塲。尤其是美國就世界經濟立場。以剖析遠東問題。探討東北四省被侵占之關係。似應着眼於經濟。如一般所注視之通貨問題。銀價穩定問題。以及市塲之開發等爲最重。然吾人試一返觀東方實際情况。細審中美兩國所處之地位。即知在華盛頓談話中所謂經濟問題。匪特不能脫離政治關係。且常受軍事上之牽制。自東北被侵以後。中國經濟。固受莫大之損失。輸入超過激增。國民經濟破敗但同時世界經濟。亦感受日本帝國主義的獨占。失去東北市塲的景響。且因東北之不安。致揚子江流域。同受非常之苦痛。頃者熱河失陷。灤東紛擾。日本軍閥肆其無厭之求。平津受武力之威脅。此雖爲我國對日問題。於世界經濟會議。或可謂爲無直接利害關聯。然若日本不放棄其武力侵略。我人民亦决不就此罷休。遠東市塲將因中日之長期紛爭。而愈陷於險境。世界經濟之新均衡狀態。必不能保。故遠東問題。不能認爲與世界經濟無關。</p>
<p>美國知其然也。又見軍縮會議之陷於停頓。和平條約之成爲虚文。國際間影響於經濟上之危險。不下於關稅戰與通貨減値也。乃經羅斯福與麥唐納赫理歐三氏愼重審議之後。對軍縮問題。於滿足法蘭西「安全保障」以外。將重提凱洛「非戰公約。」促進軍備縮小之成功。制限戰爭之威脅。并將另提一協議條約。此種條約。雖非專門對付日本。但不能謂爲與日本無關。第一在世界經濟會議席上。使果成立「補充非戰公約之協議條约。」其强力化之結果。足以充分適用於中日糾紛。否認戰爭以後。縱未必即以武力爲後援。而經濟的封鎖。在各國所領導經濟聯盟形成後。勢將有發展制日之可能第二協議條約如果成立。法國能得滿足其「安全保障」則軍縮可相對的實行。世界經濟會議。亦可完了其任務。換言之。英美兩國以及歐洲各國。必將改善其今日對立之惡狀。而爲和平之諒解。於此之時。英美必將轉其目光。集其經濟全力以從事於遠東市塲之開發。日本乃處於腹背受敵之苦境矣。</p>
<p>至於美國放棄金本位制度。實行通貨膨脹政策。剌激其國内産業。使對外貿易輸出增加。我國爲用銀國家。又爲美國製造品消售最有望之市塲。今後以列國經濟競爭之結果。悉銀價提高。而物價反致低落。此起一般購買力失墮。存貨增漲之恐慌。若長城一帶戰線擴大。竊恐經濟的和平不可得。而世界的經濟恐慌。反見深化耳。</p>
<p>故我國人民於努力苦鬥對日週旋之餘深望美國深切瞭解國際間形勢之關聯。勿拘於一時利害。貽將來更大之禍變。再望我代表宋子文氏能順應時變而善於應付之也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）　英相麥唐納今日在下院辯論外交事件時、續發表其意見、以補充其上星期由美返國時所發之簡短言論、英相謂華府各方意思、一致皆以爲如不於會議結束以前銷除戰債困難、則世界經濟大會未必能完全成功、但各方未曾籌議在經濟大會開會前處理戰債問題、英美最近商榷之結果、表示英美兩國對於立即關稅休戰之敵宜有成立一種協定之景象云、英相繼言及商約談判、謂關稅休戰不致妨碍英國繼續其現所進行之工作云、英相又稱、如軍縮會議有可使人滿意之結果、則美國準備參加諮商協定、而與聞穩定歐洲之工作、此舉之影響將增進歐洲之安全、而使被威脅國不使受戰爭之危害、此誠爲甚大之進步云、英相末稱、華府在適當時機將發表一種宣言、英美現决計盡力相助、以銷釋歐洲和平國中之恐慌云、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>修改戰債</p>
<p>美願開談判之門</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美國務卿赫爾今日聲稱、若債務國商請修改戰債、而能視作單純債務問題不涉他事者則美國隨時準備討討、惟赫爾雖承認戰債對於一般經濟狀况、有重要之影響、但不願作爲倫敦世界經濟會議之一部份、謂戰債乃美國與各債務國間之事件、當然不能成爲世界會議之討論問題、但美國願於會議期間在倫敦討論修改戰債、第其討論必須與會議完全分離、且將與各債務國分别談判云云、按赫爾此語、係評論英相麥唐納所稱修改戰債乃興復經濟所必要之圖一語而發、赫爾並表示渠僅係說明美國見解起見、並非減削戰債問題之重要性、其最後一語並謂美國準備討論債務國之任何提議、案已數月於此矣、現美京一般人士解釋赫爾此項聲明、謂其定必新與國會内民主黨領袖有所接洽而獲得若干同意云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　自美國務卿赫爾聲明美政府準備討論債務國所提調整戰債計劃後、聞已有民主黨領袖多人準備請總統秘密報告渠與英相談話情形、參院内贊成修改戰債派向來認無甚勢力者、頃聞已告敵派謂歐洲數國或將無力償付六月到期欵、長此愆期、徒事阻滯國際經濟復興之進步、今以歐洲國家對於用銀繳付一節、旣無亟原照行之表示、而對於六月到期欵亦未表示意見、致使各國除法比外、對於關稅休戰提議亦絶少熱心之贊助、故若拒絶考慮修改戰債或延付債欵、非徒不能增進實將限制美國在倫敦會議中之地位、因此一般强項反對派亦未嘗不爲之稍稍意動、故美國務卿今日作此聲明、不啻一方面請國會議員對於戰債問題加以研究、一方面則請債務國提出具體計劃、據可靠消息、倘民主黨國會議員能表示同意、則赫爾將提議延付六月到期戰債、藉以開啓今夏或在倫敦會議期内謀致最後解决途徑、至發起准債務國用銀還債之參院外交委員會主席畢德門、聞日來已深覺失望、尤其因聞若干債務國認此舉意在提高銀價、而非眞正讓步之故、職是外間盛傳國會内已有若干銀派議員將投票贊成延期償付、祇須將來重行還債時、能有一部份用銀繳付可矣、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>國恥週演講</p>
<p>廖茂如先生講甲午戰爭</p>
<p>五月八日在靑年會講</p>
<p>甲午戰爭有遠因，有近因。日本自覆幕尊王明治維新以後，蠢蠢思動，這是重要的遠因。借端生事的遠因有兩種：</p>
<p>（一）琉球問題琉球在明洪武五年，稱臣納貢，世受大明册封。在淸朝時候，每立新王，必來請封，恭順暴常，稱中國爲「父國」。然同時與日本亦有交涉，疏球世子滿十五歲必游鹿兒島，與日本周旋。同治十年有琉球難民爲台灤生番戕害，日本遂藉此圖謀鯨吞近鄰，一方以琉球爲藩，照會各國公使，聲明琉球已歸日本，一方派副島種臣來中國，探問生熟番經界。總署答稱：「琉球台灣俱我屬土，屬土之人相殺，措置在我，不勞貴國過問。」日使堅執琉球爲日本版圖，且謂我國不懲台番，彼邦將問罪島人。總署含糊應之。日本遂派兵至台，熟番迎降，與生番戰。於是我國海疆戒嚴，命船政大臣沈葆楨督福建水師赴台灤窺動靜。日本不肯撤兵，要求賠償軍費三百萬。沈葆楨於當時情狀，洞若觀火，貽書李鴻章謂倭情窘迫，故示整暇，不肯就範，我祇須厚集兵力，以逸待勞，以主待客，堅拒賠欵之議。朝廷不能用，卒因英使威妥瑪的調停，以五十萬兩成議。賠欵數目雖小，然不啻默認日本出兵正當，琉球是日本的版圖。這是中國對日外交失敗的第一次。</p>
<p>（二）朝鮮問題朝鮮臣屬我國，猶在琉球之前。日本旣得志於台灣，又思用兵朝鮮。方副島種臣來議台約；乘間詰總署，「朝鮮是否爲屬國，若屬國，請主鮮通商事」。總署答以「朝鮮雖我屬國，然内政外交，悉聽自主。」日本遂以獨立國待朝鮮。明治八年，借端派兵至朝鮮要盟，定江華條約。而我國不提嚴重抗議，默認朝鮮爲獨立自主國。這是中國對日本外交失敗的第二次。是時朝鮮王妃閔氏與大院君昰應爭權，大院君作亂，殺執政，焚日使館，淸廷聞執，派吳長慶率三千人東援。長慶用馬建忠計，直入王京，執昰應以歸。中國平亂如此迅速，使日本大失望。這次可說是中國勝利。那時朝鮮有維新黨人大唱親日論調，糾合同志，組獨立黨，與日本駐朝公使相結。中國方面有道員袁世凱時爲商務委員與閔氏一族相结託。光緒十年日使煽獨立黨作亂，殺親華派領袖殆盡。長慶世凱聞變，圍王宫討亂，得王，亂黨遂覆敗。這次又是中國勝利。自此中日各派兵駐朝鮮。十一年日本派伊藤博文爲全權大臣，與李鴻章訂天津條约，承認中日兩國對朝鮮處在平等地位。這是中國對日本外交失敗的第三次。</p>
<p>近因甲午戰爭的近因爲東學黨作亂。東學黨以提倡朝鮮國學自命，借了賦重刑苛，民不聊生的題目稱兵作亂。時在光緒二十年三月。淸廷派葉志超，聶士成率四營往援，屯牙山。日本派少壯軍人密助東學黨，用意在糜爛朝鮮全土，以啟中日戰端。中國派兵後，日本亦派兵，雙方各照天津約文，知照出兵定亂，我國提抗議，謂我以鮮王請救，故派兵，日本出兵何事。但日人答辯頑强。亂事平後，日本不肯撤兵，外務大臣陸奥宗光借题發揮，提出協同改革朝鮮内政。我駁覆，日方謂如中國不肯合作，日本當單獨行動。我請各國調停無效，而日本着着進逼，壓迫朝鮮，進兵王宫，政令悉入日人掌握。這是我國對日本外交失敗的第四次。</p>
<p>戰事中國這時除去戰爭外，没有别的路。於是向英商租了一只商船高陞載兵兩營，援助我國寄在牙山的孤軍。據說因爲電報被日本買通的緣故，没有到達先在海洋中被日艦打沉了。在朝鮮的孤軍，得不到援助，就從成歡敗退到平壤。於是日本與朝鮮結攻守同盟約，我國亦與日本正式宣戰。</p>
<p>時淸廷派衛汝貴，左寳貴，豐陞阿，馬玉崑率三十五營，由陸路趨平壤。四大軍至，鮮民歡呼夾道，而軍紀甚壞，鮮民失望。平壤軍不直趨王京，又不擇險分屯，以一萬四千餘人，聚平壤不進。日兵至，分四路應戰。東路馬玉崑血戰抗敵，打退日人，而其餘三路都失敗。又因爲中國軍隊只知往前打，失掉了聯絡和忘却了後路，爲日軍包圍。結果北路左寳貴自殺，統帥葉志超棄平壤潰逃，槍砲遺棄無數，啟日人内犯之心。這是陸軍的戰績。</p>
<p>再說海軍：光緒年間銳意建設海軍，六年至十二年經營旅順爲海軍根據地，以丁汝昌爲海軍提督。可是軍官多挈眷陸居，軍士亦常去船以嬉。平居旣少訓練，戰時自難有望。時海軍全隊出巡海洋，將歸旅順，見黑烟一放自西南來，測望之，船皆懸美旗，駛近，盡易日旗。汝昌乃令作戰備。是時我戰艦十艘分五隊，日艦十二艘。我國艦隊噸數較優於日，但速率不如。汝昌遥望日船作一字堅陣，恐其直攻中堅，張左右翼應之。諸艦速率不同，改陣遂不能整。距敵十里，卽發砲無一命中。日船駛近，改道繞攻右翼，我二船中彈火起。日艦復分兩枝，左右環攻，我陣亂。致遠藥彈盡，與日艦吉野値，管帶鄧世昌令開足馬力以突吉野中魚雷，全船軍士皆沉没。這一戰我軍失掉五隻兵艦，餘亦受餖不能軍。日艦遂縱横海上，無所顧忌。</p>
<p>日本自平壤獲勝後，編兩軍以迫我，一軍以陸軍大將山縣有朋爲司令官，渡鴨綠江直犯遼東，一軍取海道窺大連灣，旅順，以陸軍大將大山巖爲司令官。旅順爲北洋重鎭，經營數年，本有重兵防守。自宋慶調赴九連城，另命趙懷益，徐邦道，姜桂題等守之。徐邦道謂金州失，則旅順不可守，請分兵往逆日軍，懷益不聽。懷益貪鄙，旣私運去餉銀，又命人私售軍米；桂題亦庸材，於是金州大連灣相繼陷落。時存積之砲有一百數十尊，砲彈二百六十萬發，槍彈三千三百八十萬發，如此嚴城巨防，不兩日竟委之去。節制旅順軍隊之龔照璵，亦貪鄙庸劣，旅順旅即失守。遼東之禍，遂不可收拾。</p>
<p>時宋慶總統諸軍，共七十餘營。宋非大將才，不善調度，諸將又不用命，以是九連城鳳凰城相繼失陷。僅有一聶士成阨守大高嶺，連勝數次。聶以戰事遠，止聞敵來，未聞我往，故敵得前進無忌，願親率精銳數千人出敵後以牽制之。諸帥又尼之。後士成調入關内。日本遂進兵遼東，據海城，東窥遼陽，西逼營口牛莊。時我國大軍雪集海城附近，除宋慶外，湖南巡撫吳大澂亦自請出關殺敵。政府日盼捷音，乃營口，牛莊，田莊台陷，畿疆危逼。</p>
<p>日本又來窺威海，進兵山東，奪劉公島，汝昌仰藥死，於是慘淡經營之海軍，至此乃掃地以盡。</p>
<p>馬關議和，日要求割地償欵四萬萬圓。我政府遂派大臣東渡議欵，日本拒絶開議。於是派李鴻章爲全權大臣，赴馬關議和。日本派伊藤博文陸奥宗光爲全權大臣。日方要求以大沽天津山海關爲質，方可停戰。議了好久没有結果，乃先討論和欵。某次鴻章自會所歸，爲日本浪人狙擊，日本懼各國非難，允無條件停戰。然和欵仍極苛刻，幾經爭論始成議，訂定至可慘痛之馬關條約。除割讓朝鮮，台灣，澎湖列島，奉天南部以外，復賠欵二萬萬兩。奇恥大辱，無過於此。</p>
<p>結論甲午戰爭所以失敗，第一是平日太不知道敵人的情形；第二是遇事退讓，任敵人着着進逼；第三是没有統率軍隊的將領，軍備又不充實；第四是事前毫無準備，臨事又倉皇失指。</p>
<p>現時的國難比甲午時代更爲嚴重，而我們的弱點，依然如故。甲午時代尙有奮不顧身的將士，現時肯死的人，似乎更少了。三四十年的維新，没有見到一毫進步，這個恥辱，要比五月内的任何國恥，嚴重到十倍百倍。（葉文　記）</p>

<h3>卷頭語　　時裝眞義</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>服裝而呌做時，在一般人看來，一定是認做時髦，認做摩登，其實什麽呌做摩登？摩登的標準究竟怎樣？什麽呌做時髦？時髦的界限究竟怎樣？試問那個人可以答復出來，旣没有標準，没有界限，便不配呌做時，就吾看來時的意義有下面三種：</p>
<p>第一是美觀愛美，是人們的天性，不要說成人，即是小小的孩子，他便欲喜穿着美觀的服裝。你看家中一個孩子，今天如果替他穿了一件漂亮的新衣，他便喜冲冲的異常得意，有說不出的神情。大約美觀的標準：一是文雅，二是潔淨，三是平淡。最忌的是俗氣是粗獷是奇怪。</p>
<p>第二是適宜時裝的眞意，便是適宜的服裝。胡適之先生說：「無所謂時與不時，只有適與不適。適者便是時，不適者便是不時。」譬如今日人事繁忙時代，舉止貴乎敏捷，倘使依舊用那前數世紀寛袍　大袖的服裝，不但不適應用，將要笑死旁人，所以適宜的服裝，要有下面三個標準：一是輕便，二是經濟，三是簡單，最忌的是滯拙，是奢侈，是複雜。　　第三是衛生時裝的要義，要合乎衛生。小袖不便運動，獗胸則妨碍發育，此外重裘厚棉，在在容易養成没有抵禦嚴寒的能力，都不能算做時裝。衛生的時裝，第一是順天時，第二是合於科學，第三是適中，最忌的是不隨氣候，是不合科學，是過與不及。</p>
<p>本刊借着中國國貨公司舉行國貨時裝大會的機會，特刊這時裝專號，來促起國人對於時裝的注意，并矯正一般國人自來誤認時裝的眞義，因此提出這三個大綱來，貢獻社會上一般注意我國貨時裝的同志。</p>
<h3>老太太的國貨時裝</h3>
<p>— 芮壽松</p>
<p>一般「老態龍鍾」走一步摇一摇的老太太們，假使我們走到街上，走到熱鬧的市塲，尤其在那迎神賽會的盛典的時候，我們可以不用力地隨便看到：她們身上穿的，大多數是國貨士林竹和白色土布的褲子，脚上着的，是黑色斜紋布和黑緞子的尖頭鞋，少數老太太們還綉着美麗的野花，甚至還有「長命富貴」，「福壽雙全」的字樣綉着；有的老太太們，頭上還挿着木犀花和野薔薇，這種裝飾，在時髦人看來，一定要嗤之以「陳舊」，「迂腐」，但在老太太們的心理，的確算是十足的時裝！</p>
<p>她們並不是没有錢去服用「洋鬼子的國貨」，只是她們服用不來：她們並不是没有能力去「高唱提倡國貨」，只是她們覺得高唱是羞恥的，没有多大效力的，只有埋頭去幹，才能奏效！</p>
<p>並且，她們承認：她們的壯年時期已經過去，在生命的過程裏，已經流了無數的汗珠，用了無算的精力，現在年已古稀，正可以享受淸福了。因此，她們着了那種國貨時裝，一方面是表法着「娱樂暮年」，一方面是表示着慰念以往所流着的辛勤的血汗！</p>
<h3>寳寳的哭</h3>
<p>— 謙</p>
<p>是一天下雨的早晨，大概在淸明節左右？一陣陣的東北風，還吹來些寒意。二房東家的大妹妹照例料理書包，預備往學校裏去：也許是他母親的慈愛，要她多穿些衣服。「媽！不用多穿吧！怪難看的；有了這圍巾，到不覺得冷。」我聽見大妹妹這樣說，就引起了我的注意？我想，圍巾的熱度，能温及全身麽？因爲時間怱促，我顧不得閒賬，拿起雨傘出門去了。</p>
<p>鎭天伏案的我，下午五點鐘後，纔得回家休息，我剛踏進了門口，王家六歲的小女兒！寳寳，殺猪般地哭着。我總是怕煩，踱了過去望望，祇見寳寳没命的拉了大妹妹的圍巾要。王家嫂嫂，却帶怒駡道：「不久就退色的東西，要</p>
<h3>國貨時弉圖說</h3>
<p>— 紫薇</p>
<p>這圖中的一件旗袍，是用國貨淡綠色的薄綢製成，衣襟開成方角形，領口袖邊下襬，都用深綠色的薄綢，鑲成同樣的圖案，這樣就成功了一件新頴美麗而又大方的時裝了，望小姐們試裁之。</p>
<p>他甚用！你長大了，呌爸化五塊錢，買根外國貨的給你是了。」</p>
<p>這時候，我很不耐煩，便道：「王家嫂，你給她做一根罷！反正二三毛錢好辦了，這格了線呢，雖比不得外國嗶嘰，到還美觀，也不退色，大小人家，買來做旗袍，做圍巾的很多呢！至於五塊錢的外國貨圍巾，我勸你不要買罷！有國貨好代用，還買國貨，因爲東洋人正在打進來了！」我這段在她認爲哲學化的話，王家嫂當然不能滿意，但拗不過寳寳的哭，就趁着空，拉了大妹妹，出門購布。</p>
<p>晚上九點鐘之前，王家的寳寳，笑嘻嘻跑到我邊來，總是她媽手脚快，寳寳的頸項上，已圍着根國貨線呢做的，黑白色格子圍巾。的確，她很得意，也很天眞的給我瞧。我便問道：「寳寳！這圍巾的布是中國貨，你歡喜麽？一她說：「歡喜的，我聽大妹妹說：用國貨是愛國！」奇怪！六歲女孩，也懂得「國貨」，「愛國」。可知我們多數同胞，對於購用國貨的心理，還未全部泯滅，可是我對於王家嫂的說話，我始終疑慮着。</p>
<h3>愛人的禮物</h3>
<p>— 劉曾慰</p>
<p>張一民興冲冲的從家裏出來，手裏拿着一只很大的放衣服的盒子，盒子上而印着有ＸＸ國貨公司的字樣。</p>
<p>「這一定很受她的歡迎的吧。」他在肚裏暗暗思量，面上就不時露出了笑容來。</p>
<p>「一民，你要用國貨啊，國貨有的亦很好啊，就是貨物稍有不大好的，但用了對於良心上終是快樂的。一這是秀英丨丨一民的愛人的話，那時又記上了一民的心頭了。</p>
<p>「一定的，一定極受她的歡迎。」一民的肚裏，又是這麽忖着。一回兒，停止在一家人家的門前了，高舉了一隻手在　電鈴，同時又低了頭看看他另一隻手中的東西。</p>
<p>門開了，他很快的走了進去。</p>
<p>「你來了，帶了些什麽東西來啊？」一個美麗的姑娘，從裏面出來·見了他手中拿了一盒東西就這麽說。</p>
<p>「秀英，你猜猜看。」他笑嘻嘻的說。</p>
<p>「可不是你的大衣？」</p>
<p>「不是。」</p>
<p>「是你的西裝麽？」</p>
<p>「不是，我聽了你的話，早不穿西裝了。」</p>
<p>「那是怎麽呢？」</p>
<p>「那是給你的。」</p>
<p>「給我的？」</p>
<p>「是啊，給你的。」</p>
<p>「又是怎麽舶來品的東西麽？」</p>
<p>「不是，不是。我知道你不歡喜舶來品的，怎麽會再給你買舶來品的東西呢？」他說罷，很得意的把那盒子打開來，拿出了一件新製成的衣服。</p>
<p>「給你買了一件新裝。」他拿了那件衣服給她看，一邊又這麽說，</p>
<p>「新裝不是舶來品的？」</p>
<p>「不是，我是從中國國貨公司定製的國貨新裝。」</p>
<p>「眞的麽？」</p>
<p>「誰騙你，不信你看那放衣服的盒子好了。</p>
<p>秀英果眞把那盒子細看。上面印有中國國貨公司字樣，這纔使她相信了，那新裝是中國貨，歡喜很了不得。</p>

<h3>時裝展覽的翌日</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>某一年的冬天，上海市舉行了一次盛大的菊花會，時裝展覽也是菊花會的重要節目之一；不用說，參與時裝展覽的當然是那些摩登的姑娘們，而這一次却大部是素負盛名的XX女塾的高材生。</p>
<p>時裝展覽後的翌日，XX女塾的校長林太太，忽然召集了那十幾位參加表演的學生到她辦公室中去。</p>
<p>「小姐們，辛苦了，你們又努力了一次偉大的亡國工作」！林校長堆着苦笑，說了一句似乎是很滑稽的官話。</p>
<p>十幾位姑娘全呆住了，莫明其妙地咀嚼着，「亡國工作」這一個新奇的名詞。</p>
<p>「昨天你們不是很出風頭嗎？劉倩鴻穿的是巴黎緞，王斐云穿的是什麽美國閃光紗，陶靜芬的是喬奇絨，眞漂亮，眞闊綽，可惜你們没有高高的鼻子，碧油油的眼睛和金黄的紅髮，不然你們眞成了西方美人了！」</p>
<p>林太太的尖刻的打趣，立刻使她的高足們覺悟了自己的罪惡，十幾張臉齊像塗了胭脂一般的紅。</p>
<p>「老實說，你們已悮解了「時裝」這個名詞了！衣裝的時不時，全在式樣的變換，决不在衣料的更調；我們中國出産的綢緞正不少，顔色和花紋也不見得多比外國貨差，儘可以用來當時裝的衣料。你們雖然是女人，難道就不知道用國貨是人人應有的責任嗎？」說到這裏，林太太的枯瘦的手掌不住在桌子上碰着。「覺悟吧！快别迷信着西洋貨了，到亡國之後，你們也許會想到你們自己的罪惡了」！</p>
<p>「席話居然把這十幾位美麗的姑娘們底糊塗的腦神筋喚醒了，大家都覺得」老太婆」丨林校長底綽號丨今天這一番敎訓，眞有不能不服從的力量，都心悅意服地鞠躬而退。</p>
<p>不過，他們是否都能服用國貨，却還得瞧環境能不能　促她們咧！</p>

<p>「我拿去穿穿看。」她從一民手中拿了那件衣服，跑到裏面去了。</p>
<p>一回兒，她穿了那新裝出來了。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？」她對一民笑着說。</p>
<p>「很好！很好！」一民笑嘻嘻的說。　　「我不是和你說過，國貨也可做很好的新裝的麽？如今你可相信了？」秀英又對一民說。</p>
<p>「我早相信了的，所以給你買了這國貨新裝來了。」一民回答。</p>
<p>「我們進去談談吧。秀英說着，就和一民進去了。</p>
<h3>時裝漫談</h3>
<p>— 柯定盫</p>
<p>丨獻給靑春時代的女人們丨</p>
<p>時代之神這樣地告訴我們：「時代是不絶地進展，没有停止的時候，假如停止了，也就是天覆地滅的時候！」那麽現在靑春時代的人們，應當怎樣地追逐着時代，去作一個在時代前的新人物，不要在時代後作個落伍者。</p>
<p>靑春是寳貴的，誰都也承認。我以爲在衣飾上加以研究，也是長駐靑春的妙術。那麽現在且來談談服裝的時代化。</p>
<p>一般靑春的女人們，伊們很了解伊們的時候，也很會鈎心鬥角的精裁密製；但是有個缺點，就是專門用的外貨衣料，情願做一個外貨的推鎖員。關於這點我要盡一百二十分的敬意向靑春的女人們忠告，在以後你假如製作新衣的時候，還是去揀選國貨的衣料來得好；因爲現在的國貨綢縐，早已超越了外國貨的優美，它們正展開了美麗和明絢的神情在期待着你們。</p>
<p>時序已轉入了夏令，關於衣飾，當然也隨時序而更變方式。我來介紹幾種時裝吧！女人喜歡穿着長長的衣服，已成了當前的風氣，短褲和長褲，已成了對等的陣勢。我以爲保全女性的尊貴起見，在長　的衣服之下，短褲很不適宜。假如你穿着短褲去逛公園，你向遊椅坐下，那條短褲，不期然而褪向上去，這似乎很不雅觀，在你是還未覺得，在旁人看來，還當你没有穿着褲子。我的意思是要把褲脚放長，褲脚的口徑，最大不得過七寸，長度和外面的長衣一樣，它的衣料，要裏外一色，最好是在衣的邊緣和褲的脚管，配上匀稱的花邊，更能增加許多美點。</p>
<p>印花喬其紗，是點綴女人的好衣料，在夏令最好是用淡綠底，深綠花來製衣服，肩頭做荷葉下垂式的披肩，領子是不用，是做袒肩式的，到腰間一細，下面用純黑色的做成摺　式，長及足跟，脚上的高跟鞋，最好也用淡綠色鑲深綠色的花。</p>
<p>純黑喬其紗製成的長衣，很宜於頎長而白晳的女人們，不必鑲也不必滚，袖口到臂灣，用寛緊帶扣住，那扣住的上面要放大，那麽在晚風中，可有飄拂的逸態呢！兩旁的叉，要開得高，裏面用摺摺式做好，這樣，雖然大步的跑，看不見腿，而且又不礙於跑跳，脚上是穿黑紋皮的跑鞋，那纔合式。</p>
<p>大紅的衣料，用於夏日，似嫌過火，不過用在年約十五六的少女們，也能顯露伊們的眞美。假如製一襲袒領及胸的短袖套衫，我想豐度一度是絶妙的！　　方格的雙縐，很宜於靑春的女人，製作與選色方面，全在自己心裁，假使能夠運用腦筋的話，我可以說：「定能在海上的時裝，開一番新氣象」呢！</p>
<h3>時裝與美化</h3>
<p>— 時典</p>
<p>「裝」而入「時」在理論上，自然是「十全十美」，合於美化原理了。　　實際上，却並不完全如斯，儘有許多的所謂時裝，並不見得美化，而且，竞然還有根本就不合美化原理的。</p>
<p>原因很簡單，是爲着社會的一般羣衆，都是盲目的。女子自然不能例外。她們們而見到所謂「時髦人」的新奇服裝，便認爲那定是最美化的時裝，虚榮心往往追驅了她們，立刻去模仿它。可是，它究竟合不合美化，她們是茫然的，是缺乏理性底制裁的。</p>
<p>眞正的時裝，無疑地，是必須吻合美化原理的，運用科學方法以設計完成的。我們不必定要有絲織品或其他之高貴衣料，因爲，那不一定是美化的，穿在身上，不過顯出一股黄金臭味吧了。幽雅而樸素的布料，加以精巧的裁製，披在苗條的妙齡女體上，婀娜多姿，飄飄欲仙，那才是平民化的時代化的美術化的時裝哩！</p>
<h3>國難聲中的國貨時裝</h3>
<p>— 胡樓貞女士</p>
<p>国或難一天一天地緊迫，人人應該負起救國的責任來，這是絶對無庸諱言的：然而救國愛國，絶不是空言高調所能濟事，最重要的，是從我們各個人做起！</p>
<p>春光明媚，它濃厚的程度，已經達到了最高度；實際上已是「夏的開篇」，所以天氣已經由温和而漸入於暖熱　，在這個當兒，我們究竟選擇什麽來做我們的國貨時裝呢？丨我們在這裏約略貢獻並介紹，我們夏令的時裝，以與我女界同胞共同商榷：</p>
<p>在前面，我們已經說過：救國愛國，應從各個人自己做起。當此夏令初屆，我們的國貨衣料，我以爲最好用自由布或雪恥布，「這是我的主觀標準）因爲這兩種是道地的國貨，其形式旣美雅，而它的質料又堅實，據我近年來的一點小經騐，認爲非常滿意；丨關於它的一切，我以爲决非洋貨所能企及！</p>
<p>在這不冷不熱靑黄交替的時候，着綢穿緞，恐怕還非其時，所以雪恥布和自由布還正好像是「壯年時期」，它的給人家鑑賞，至少還可以維持到四十天的壽命，這是可以斷乎言之！</p>
<h3>鄕村婦女們的時裝</h3>
<p>— 冠山</p>
<p>蔚藍色的天空，浮着幾絲白雲，輕輕的緩緩的在飄着；一陣地的微風夾着花的香味撲上面來，鳥聲充滿宇宙，啊　好一片晚春天氣，眞是遠足的時候。想你在這天氣和暖的陽春，必也曾到野外遠足過或散步過，在走過鄕村的時候，你若向門内望望，就可以看見在三十歲以上的婦女，穿着靑布的短衫，白粗布的褲子，頭上有的紥着靑色格子的劣等手巾，脚上着的是黑斜紋布的鞋子，坐在那裏很靜的做着她們的針線。三十歲以下的婦女，穿着紅布褲子，條子布或有花頭的布短衫，足是大多赤着，頭上無包頭，却插着幾枝黄色白色的野花，愉悅地天眞地在辦理她們細瑣的家務，或同她們的兒女在玩着。</p>
<p>眞正的愛國者要算鄕下婦女們，她們不講究美觀，她們很是節儉，紅的花的格子的在她們要算最最的美麗了，她們用不着什麽綢緞，却能很天然的很神秘的顯着她們最優美的時裝：們她純粹的用着國貨，却不像城市婦女們滿口，喊着國貨，而身上穿着印度綢；我以爲城市的婦女，都要以他們爲榜樣，傚着她們天眞的儉樸的時裝。</p>
<h3>時裝與國貨</h3>
<p>— 泉</p>
<p>春神歸去，夏之神漸漸到臨，大地顯出和煦的蓬勃氣概。</p>
<p>呆重的衣服，「時」會告訴它，那是已落令了。</p>
<p>人們得在此時，除去落令衣服，換上輕飄的單夾衣。</p>
<p>在這當兒，少女們便將不惜金錢，去選擇那苗條而動人的時裝。</p>
<p>做時裝，那是順應自然環境的要圖。在你未做之前，千萬别忘記了一點，那便是儘量去選用國貨料了。</p>
<p>祖國是已如斯危卵了，東三省和熱河同胞，已在做着十足道地的亡國奴，我們靠天靠地（？）依然能夠在這裏呼吸自由空氣，而且，還有機會享受那「時裝」，和亡國奴東三省和熱河同胞，相差實已有如天壞了，</p>
<p>住在現實的天堂上，應該快用國貨，否則，我們怕不會和這些亡國奴們遭受同樣運命！</p>
<p>而且，善良的同胞們哟！你莫輕視了國貨，在國貨中儘多是旣美麗而又耐穿的，價錢又便宜，還可救國，穿在苗條的少女體上，格外顯出嫵媚而婀娜動人！</p>
<p>窈窕的淑女們哟！盍一注意及之！</p>
<h3>我家的國貨服裝</h3>
<p>— 曼彬</p>
<p>我家的國貨服裝，說起來很有趣味的，我不妨來講講：</p>
<p>第一是外子他穿衣是素來儉樸的，不過他最注意的第一是質料題，吾替他做採辦員，很是困難。有時偶然隨便買了一些，他信任不過，往往不許裁製，有一次做好以後，因爲恐怕不是眞的國貨，依舊不穿。所以後來我素性到他指定他的熟識廠家去買，布疋如三友，鴻新，綢緞如美亞，呢絨如章華等廠，使他可以放心。第二是裁製問題，他很講究時的，可是他的時，便是適宜，不長不短，不寛不狹，所謂適中而已。有一次他忽然高興穿起國布的學生弉，問他爲何學時，他說無所謂時，不過靈便罷了。</p>
<p>第二是自己吾的服裝，也是以國貨爲惟一質料，不過注意的花色和經穿，花色取文雅而永不退色。像我們人家，預算中的服裝費，每月共計十六元，不好常常添製，所以經穿倒是最最要緊的一個問題。我的衣服，都是自己做，所以不管時不時，只問適意不適意。</p>
<p>第三是小兒上次銓兒參加家庭日新會服裝改良會以後，便引起她愛穿國貨服裝的習慣，什麽二一二呀，雪花呢呀，都是她愛用的衣料。最近胥仰南先生送來鴻新的新出布樣，鴻新花色，含有文雅平淡淸靜三個要素，她最先試用，試穿以後，到銀行則同事都仿效她，到滬大商學院則同學都仿效他，後來阿維阿通阿圓等，都要穿布衣了，阿通阿圓尤愛短衣的嚴裝，他們一穿了短裝，再穿上了皮鞋，倒覺得雄糾糾氣昂昂神氣十足了。還有吾最不贊成小孩赤膊，所以鵝牌汗衫，不要說成人不可少，我家小孩，個個都歡喜穿的。</p>

<h3>花卉與女權</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>牢不可破的舊式藥劑師，每逢合藥，總守着千百年來的傳統思想，便是拒絶「鷄犬婦人」入内。逢和昔日西人的公園，不　「狗與華人」入内，是同樣的侮辱。所以，我對於合藥時的避忌「鷄犬婦人」，認爲是一種蹂躪女權的惡習慣，非得把來打倒不可。</p>
<p>二十世紀的提高女權，雖曰人事，豈非天意？吾見自然界中的一花一草，很有幾種替女界張目，因此曉得提高女權是天意。</p>
<p>一，是蘭花。種蘭的秘訣，每日淸晨，須用櫛髮油垢的手，幕　一下，花便開的芬芳了，尤其是婦人的手，最爲相宜。淮南子上說：「男子植蘭，美而不芳，情不相與往來也。」可見蘭花是接近女性，而厭惡男性的；如果中國有了女總統或女主席，那提倡女權的蘭，確有認爲國花的必要。　　二，是怕老婆草。這種草，是出在廣西思恩府的，顧名思義，便可以表示老婆的權威。每株草發生十餘葉，形若鳳尾，花開作淡黄色，生長在牆角路隅。倘與男子接近，細葉自會活動；只須婦人上前一喝，草便孱於　威，動都不敢動了！怕女人不怕男子，這是怕老婆草的特性。</p>
<p>三，是女香男臭草。堅觚集上有一段記載，略說：「此草，婦女佩之，香聞數里，男子佩之，便生奇臭；昔海上有丈夫，拾得此草，惡其臭，棄之。有女子抬去，草便香甚；其人跡於後，欲奪還此草；女子疾走，逐之不及。故曰：「欲知女子强，轉臭得成香」。我在昔年看了紅樓夢，見林妹妹口中動輒駡人臭男子，以爲，這是林妹妹的武斷。現在明白了，林妹妹的說話，也有根據的，料想伊看過這一段女香男臭草的故事，所以給予男子們一個臭字的諡法吧。再者，凡是市塲中大廉價的綢緞店，洋貨店，每逢女客上門尤其是摩登婦女；店夥們在足尺加二以外。還肯通融一二；要是，男客上門，便得不到這般的權利了。我想，這些店夥先生們，大概也是女香男臭草的化身吧。呵呵。</p>
<h3>不死藥</h3>
<p>— 徐絜</p>
<p>請我們貴國所禮聘的飛簷，走壁，點穴，劍仙，來和日本身佩太上老君「急急如律令，勅」！如神符神兵，或吃了大阪大學土田盛一氏所研究的秦始皇長生藥的仙兵，鬭起法來，究竟誰敗誰勝，只得且待下回分解。</p>
<p>飛簷，走壁，點穴，劍仙，是我們的國粹法寳：「急急如律令，勅」！的神符，和秦始皇的長生藥，此是我們的國粹，不過被日本人偷去，做了法寳。劍光一道，喊一聲「着」，不知道能否殺死佩神符的日本兵？兩個指頭一點，不知道能否點死了吃不死藥的日本人？各顯精通，煞是好看！當然，國聯瞧了，要齒戰股慄，面無人色。因此世界决無第二次大戰。亞東便没有風雲，豈非都受法寳之賜？</p>
<p>據東京朝日新聞說：「秦始皇差徐福到日本求不老長生的靈藥：徐福到了日本，苦心研究，結果，發明了種不死藥。此藥理經大阪大學工學部内釀造學科土田盛一氏的研究，已知道它的成分，是：（一）人參（二）丁字（三）茴香（四）支蘭（五）土當歸（六）大黄（七）川芎等，配合而成。土田氏已造成了一種長生酒，在工學部釀造學實騐室試釀，製成奇異芳香的藥酒了。」哈！哈！日本人眞會弄玄虚，這項消息，在下决其有兩種作用：（一）麻醉他們兵士，和「神符」有同樣的催眼作用。（三）麻醉中國愚民，來推廣他們的藥材。吉林人參，本來没有甚麽補性，徒供我們貴國的商人，欺詐取財吧了。高麗參的漏巵，年約數百萬，目下再加了人參的漏巵，尤爲可驚了。其他，茴香吃了大量，有毒，大黄要瀉，川芎，當歸，不過活血，吃了這個「不死藥」，未必不死，恐怕還要速死咧！</p>
<p>日本人死後，都是「火葬」，軍閥，財閥，都是一撮「灰塵」吧了！要是這種不死藥，果然靈騐，那末，海底可打籬笆，拓殖土地，侵凌外國，尤爲他們緊要　　情感與理智</p>
<p>情感通過了理智的電流，其痛苦眞不堪言狀；然而，其回味也，賽過橄欖。</p>
<p>理智經過了情感的洗禮，其愉快比得十萬金都興奮；可是，那味道比蜜糖甜，比辣椒辣。</p>

<h3>今天到虹廟</h3>
<p>— 柯定盫</p>
<p>天天起早，這是我的習慣。這幾天的天氣，很是温和，早上也格外容易起身了。今天從寓所出來，沿着南京路朝西走，滿意想到靜安寺路去，那裏知道走到保安司徒廟，丨俗稱虹裏丨向裏一望，香火很盛。陡然想起了今天原是廢曆四月十五日。我們的一般民衆丨政府正在實行國曆，你們却陽奉陰違的：「我行我素」丨以小比大，可想而知，這種因循主義的信徒，實在多得不可勝數，尤其是在上海一埠。</p>
<p>走進了司徒廟，我就用着冷靜的目光在觀察一般的香客，來把它分析一下，可得下面的幾種：（一）失業者，（二）心神不定者，（以上屬男性）（三）以燒香爲分内事者，（四）冀神佑護伊Ｘ業發達者，（五）監護着而來者，（以上屬女性）其他莫名者，還有着不少。</p>
<p>失業者的神態，好似把他民的整個的紊亂的思想懸掛着一般，當他把頭貼在拜墊上的誠心，和不止三跪五叩的敬意想起，至少他現在是賦閒着。</p>
<p>心神不定者仍意志摇幌的情形，也很覺顯露，當他手裏拿着一張籤書的時候，雙目不瞬的注視，大概這一籤，定是一張下下呢！</p>
<p>以燒　香爲分内事者，這是另一種婦女，伊們腰際掛着一個黄布袋，毫無意義的寫着Ｘ門Ｘ氏，下面寫着比較大一些的：「朝山進香」四個字。我正不知道伊們所朝的是個什麽「山」？還有一個年輕的女人，掛着的黄布袋上，却寫着一個大「佛」字，那個佛字，剛巧罩在伊腰間的下部。我想「佛如有靈，也當呌屈。」</p>
<p>一般所謂生意上的女人，身上穿着摩登化的大衣，手裏却捉着一個十八世紀的舊香籃，當伊們下拜的時候，小嘴裏似乎在那裏默默地念着什麽！這一定是暗禱神靈爲伊的業務發達。</p>
<p>還有一般監護着而來的，看伊們的神情很難看，頭髮蓬鬆得似亂草，臉兒萎黄得似敗蠟，也機械的挿香點燭；我看伊好似在睡夢中一般。</p>
<p>其他有個穿着西裝的少年，也在三跪九叩拜着，這該屬於；「心神不定者」一類了。</p>
<p>用平均的估計，每人費半元錢的：元賓檀香，蠟燭，紙錠，經圖……等，在那一個鐘頭的時間裏，竟有：老婦四十三人，少婦七十六人，中年婦五十一人，將男二十三人，老人和老婦十九人，其他小孩同來和像我一樣的看客還不計在内。</p>
<p>看了爐火通紅，和香烟缭燒，想起了灤東的大戰，令人不寒而慄！</p>

<h3>抽丁（中）</h3>
<p>— 天恨生</p>
<p>這有什麽法子好想呢！又不是一個人家的事，我們這村裏該抽的想必不少，如何好想法子！」</p>
<p>「没有法子想，不是就讓他去麽？這一去，幾時回來呢？能不能回來呢？天呀，」伊又忍不住由失望而哭，伏在卓子上，不再要求楊老頭想法子了，伊是絶望了！</p>
<p>楊老頭本來愛這個女兒，未嫁時，要什麽就有什麽，從來不忍使伊失望。這回遇到無能爲力的事，却又是關係女兒一生，並且自己没有兒子，將來也要靠這女婿照顧的，忽然被抽丁抽了去，怎麽不心痛！這時聽到女兒說「能不能回來呢？」他就立刻意識到：這打仗是多麽危險的事，槍砲没有眼晴，女婿這一去，多分是凶多吉少！但這話不能對女兒說，一時又没有可以安慰女兒的話，只好一任女兒悲慘地突着！</p>
<p>嬸母從外面走來，看了這情形，並不詫異。伊早知道姪女必是爲了姪女婿被抽丁而哭了；並且，伊已眼見四五個人家在同樣地號哭，雖然覺得可憐，却不像楊老頭那樣的慘痛。伊另有一種心理，看了别人家哭。好似平日别人家在有意無意間給予伊的憤懣得而一洩，不平之氣便平了下來，那就是因爲伊没有兒子也没有女兒的緣故。</p>
<p>楊老頭在低了頭嘆氣，狗姑娘在哭，對於嬸母進門，都不曾覺得。</p>
<p>「哎呀！狗姑娘也是爲了抽丁罷？作孽！但，儘哭着又有何用呢！」嬸母原没有同情心，狗姑娘也知道，而且從前未嫁時就不喜這個嬸娘，聽了這幾句話，並不抬頭。</p>
<p>楊老頭也不是回答嬸娘，只是自己對自己說話似的：「咳！眞作孽！無端怎麽打起仗來！陳老五由城裏回來，曾說起外面打仗，他說離我們這裏很遠，怎麽又到這裏來抽丁呢？難道打的人已經打完了麽！」</p>
<p>「姑媽家裏也是哭得一團糟！」嬸娘說。</p>
<p>楊老頭似乎驚愕，看了嬸娘一眼，說：「伊只有兩個兒子呀？」</p>
<p>「兩個就要抽一個！」</p>
<p>「答應他抽了麽？」</p>
<p>「怎麽好不答應。阿貴的胆子倒不小，他並不怕，說這是賴不下來的，去就去便了，那裏會去了就是死。可是阿貴的妻，却哭得比我們狗姑娘還厲害！」</p>
<p>「這也難怪！」楊老頭點點頭。</p>
<p>「那裏就該厲害到這個樣子！」嬸娘又是一種不平：「伊不去拉住阿貴，却拉着姑媽，要姑媽不准阿貴去；阿貴去了·伊就向姑媽討丈夫，理得姑媽更加了　層爲難！」</p>
<p>「此刻怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「阿貴還没有走，伊就這樣蠻横，哭得在地下打滚，要姑媽給伊看住丈夫，將來阿貴去了，伊不更要纏住姑媽麽？姑媽素日把這個媳婦縱容得過分了，反爬到婆的頭上去，此刻是怕將來媳婦鬧不淸，想法子去了！」</p>
<p>「這有什麽法子好想呢？」楊老頭很覺奇怪，向嬸娘反問着。</p>
<p>「你也給我想法子去！」狗姑娘突然跳起來，拉住楊老頭一隻手，推推說：姑媽能去想法子，你也就能給我想法子去，爸爸，你道我好說話麽？小牛被抽去，我也向你討丈夫！」狗姑娘突然也使出蠻來，倒不哭。但伊的蠻和阿貴妻不同，伊是撒嬌。</p>

<p>他說着話，便在前面走，關殷二人，後面走，關殷二人，後面緊緊跟着。走進了大門，恰是桂枝婦了白爐子裏的煤灰，要向外倒，他看見關耀武，呆呆的站定，只管望着。關耀武看到，也是吃了一驚，問道：你不是桂枝表妹。桂枝道：是呀，你是關家表哥。聽說你在山海關，什麽時候回北平的？媽呀，關家表哥來了。伊放下才上一筐子煤渣，轉身向屋子裏面跑。江氏口裏問着那個關家表哥，迎了出來。關耀武已是離開殷趙二人，走向楊家院子裏來，看到江氏，就呌了一聲大姨。江氏笑道：了不得，原來是關家表哥，怎麽會找到我們這裏來的。關耀武走進屋來，先鞠着躬拜年。看看這裏雖是兩間陋屋，放着破舊的東西，却是打掃得乾乾凈凈的，心裏便想着，怪不得老趙只管誇耀他的鄰居好，這是事實，並非瞎說的。江氏見他向屋子四週打量着，便向他笑道：你瞧怎麽着？我們家是越來越窮呀，因爲這個緣故，所以許多親戚朋友，現在都没有了來往，表哥怎麽知道我們住在這裏？關耀武道：我們那裏又知道呀？只因爲這後院的趙連長，是我的同事，我們還是把子啦，今天要到這兒给趙老伯拜年來了。江氏道：這兒趙連長，老說着有個關連長，誰知道就是表哥呀，巧極了。我是去年上半年搬到這兒來的，也快有一年了。關耀武道：我那裏知道大姨住在這裏，我要是知道，早就來看您來了。我現在到後院裏去拜個年，說着，他向後院去了。這時，殷得仁知道老姑娘是關連長的姨表妹，深悔不該在他面前說笑話，就是趙自强，也不敢再提一個字了。關耀武都看在心裏，在後院坐了一會子，又到前面來和江氏母女談天。江氏忙着招待了一番茶水，談些兩家的事情，關耀武就問着表妹有了人家没有？（六六）</p>

<p>昨日銀洋市况、以銀行封關半天、已達三日、對於市氣已甚冷淡、錢莊方面交易冷落、無重大上下、以致拆息竟無行情、早午統做白借、拆票产易因而無從核計、大約轉賬及新交易五百餘萬、午市及小總會一百餘萬、劃頭加水則漲至二角八九分、銀行收解、外商收解洋欵五百十餘萬、銀欵五百三十餘萬、進倉一百萬、華商收解票欵及各種貨匯兌什諸欵收解八百八九十萬、進倉六十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千五百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解八百六十餘萬、各路匯欵六十餘萬、客路去胃三十餘萬、洋押欵交易一百二十餘萬、銀行鈔票收回及發出一百五十餘萬、又本市票據交換所十日交換總數、計銀元四百七十七萬四千五百零三元三角、内計銀元二百五十一萬六千七百五十六元三角七分、匯劃銀元二百二十五萬七千七百四十六元九角三分、</p>

<p>絲茶蘇浙春蠶近訉</p>
<p>（揚中）四面環江、近年來農民因育蠶迭遭損失、蠶本大受虧蝕對於蠶事均甚灰心、今歲天時不正、四鄕桑樹發芽遲遲、現始欣欣産葉、老郎街·碼頭橋·三茅宫·新壩·興隆鎭·油坊橋一帶植有桑田者、咸借本購育改良種、收蟻時天氣晴暖、蠶蟻發育頗佳、早帮已三眠開葉、晚帮甫行三眠、惜飼額有限、</p>
<p>（新昌）今歲農民早育之土種蠶、因受天時之損害、至全部傾棄、而農蠶經濟窘迫、補育之晚蠶、咸惜本購種、幸氣候晴暖、蠶蟻發育順利、四鄕葉産亦盛、葉價不高、現下黄澤一帶最早之蠶、已入大眠、次者三眠開葉、晚者甫行三眠起眠、轉瞬早蠶可作繭、</p>
<p>拱埠繭行預備開秤</p>
<p>杭屬繭汛最早、臨平：高司·三堡各區早蠶將上族作繭、故拱宸橋一帶、繭行均預備開秤、惟租出者寥寥、聞祗緯成等四五家、現正換領繭帖、以備秤收新繭云、</p>
<p>遂安新茶繼續開盤</p>
<p>自前日温州綠茶開盤後、昨日遂安莊珍眉綠茶又復繼續開盤、土莊新貨亦均先後開出新價、全市共由協和同孚等行買進珍眉針眉兩項綠茶三百八十餘箱、遂安珍眉頂盤開出一百五十五元、土莊珍眉一百三十元、針眉四十五六元、與去年開盤比較大旨易兩爲元、華茶商多數均遭虧折、惟日來遂安·湖州·蕭山·大南山·羊坳各路産茶軿域、因滬市未能振興、人心亦復趨軟、行情暴跌十餘元至三十元不等云、</p>
<p>糧食</p>
<p>河下米價續跌一二角</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源四十餘號、零躉兩胃仍懈、致成交依舊無幾、市况平淡、蘇同粳及南港米價小角砠、薄稻包胃雖有、南北洋兩帮繼續勳辦、而爲數不夥、如北洋帮祗僅千包、南洋帮三四百包、且採取各有不同、北洋皆選高料、南洋合意中關、其吃盤仍屬苛刻、似有非小不取之感、致靑甬松江泗楓西練等貨價跌二角之譜、僅小數零胃所納者、價格似見站定耳、杜洋尖亦小角砠、陰變元乏貨無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源念七八艘、白粳走化略交、市形高料定勢、中次帶軟、早薄稻到消兩和、價亦平定、美尖社尖平正、埠客秈高　、中次無甚上落、變元平定之格、</p>
<p>粉價一致下落</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份均見一致回跌之象、以洋麥報價、美坎兩處均回跌七八角左右、所以開市後人心卽見不振、本月份卽較跌一分、遠期跌一分半分、迨至以後各盤、因大小廠家、均有抛售、數在十萬包左右、致市氣又復懈寂、故至收盤、遠期計落二分之譜、迨至下午開盤、初仍平疲、旗因交易又復轉淸、抛戶亦無動靜、外行人心、遂又轉穩、較之上午之最低價、回好近分、至各廠方面、聞手中籌碼尙多、故一遇機會、仍難免抛壓也、結果本月份較小七釐半、六月份跌一分二釐半、七八九月份跌一分、十月份跌一分二釐半、</p>
<p>新麥有豐收之望</p>
<p>昨日期麥平疲之象、以洋麥報價回跌七八角、市塲人心不穩、不過目下交易、終少發展、因各廠之洋麥存底、尙能應用二三個月、而國内新麥再經一月、亦可收穫、最近各産區預测、頗有豐收之望、是以麥市前途、恐較粉市更難樂觀也、結果五六月份未開、七八九月份各跌三分、十月份未開云、</p>
<p>靑中餅銷胃暢達</p>
<p>豆餅市形因本廠餅喊價較客餅見高、故行家配内地去胃、均以客餅爲主、且客餅或色片量尙佳、所以受方亦樂受也、昨市惟牛莊西義盛餅成交二千片外、靑中餅獨售開一萬片、雖開原盤然氣象頗穩、</p>
<p>糖市標金續漲糖市特緊</p>
<p>丨粗砂白又升二角丨</p>
<p>昨日糖市以標金續漲、而荷匯反縮、故趨勢特緊、公會劃盤二四粗砂白初市普通貨劃二十元零四角、比前日升起一角半、較高者後市劃二十元零三角、二十號中砂白呌十九元六角、八九號荷赤十六元一角、稍有成交、好起五分、廠盤有昌興行開出光華糖廠祿字二十元零四角半、壽字十九元九角、磨砂加廣包二十元零六角、又開出ＲＡ綿荷白二十一元三角半、計成交數千袋、後市因市上二五粗花出戶均要扳高、磨砂要扳二十元零七角各綿糖亦將扳緊一步、方肯再兌、號盤有廣潮帮開出海南赤一百六十餘包、價爲十三元四角至三角、潮靑頂高提莊呌十三元未開、普通貨成交百數十包、價爲十二元至十一元三角、標準五福白氷昨日開出一百箱、每砠價爲十七元六角、比前降去四角、前爲某號冒牌事、因五福廠擬從事澈究某號自知理缺已停止做冒、免起交涉、後市可無擾亂之虞矣、</p>
<p>南北貨龍口粉愈開愈賤</p>
<p>丨僅二十元零六角丨</p>
<p>龍口粉近來客盤時見鬆落、自二十一元進關後、昨市復見續降、共開出一百七十件、價爲二十元零二角、較之前盤又小四角、查今年最高價須合二十五元六七角、降度已達五元半、可謂廉宜極矣、</p>
<p>油市白桐油漲風已戢</p>

<h3>生意經（十二）</h3>
<p>五金業之茶會生會波</p>
<p>上茶會之時間</p>
<p>五金帮做茶會生意者。稱爲跑茶會。其所販賣之貨物。均爲建築類中之五金品。本埠同業做茶會生意者約十五六家。其範圍較大者。厥惟源樁新仁昌源祥源亨等數家。時間在下午四時至八時。其行程四時六時在偷鷄橋蘿春閣茶樓。六時至八時在大馬路同羽　春·一樂天以及四馬路長樂等茶樓。此外四馬路天蟾及城内桂花廳。則隨時均可。故其市面之最大者。當推蘿春閣茶樓。其所到人數爲洋行帮建築木行帮以及同業帮等。其買賣對洋行方面則談定貨。對同業及本行帮等則談訴貨。而建築帮買賣則祇談需用之地點。需要之貨品。惟不談及行情之高低。但在送貨時發票上再塡價格。（照市約要高三四錢至一兩不等）其收欵手續或大小月底。或等房東方面領着後再付。或每月祗收一次。或亦有現欵者。因此行情方面。勢不得不隨之而有上落也。</p>
<p>同業中跑茶會之跑街。均稱爲跑茶會。而經理跑茶會則稱爲上茶會。其在跑茶會之經費。每人均要付納茶費一元。至於營業方面之五金品以竹節鋼·水門汀·三角鐡·鋼絲網·新洋元·法西釘·瓦楞鐡油毛玷等數十種花色。至於柏油滋碍等亦有鉅大交易。</p>
<p>茶棧帮的生意</p>
<p>上海茶棧帮約分安徽·江西·福建·杭紹·廣東等帮。勢力最健。要推安徽帮。次爲杭紹，所辦之五金品，爲小條靑鉛·二號白鉛皮　十磅馬口鐡·一寸二五法西針等四種而已。茶帮呼白鉛皮爲鋅片或鋅皮。馬口鐡爲小新鐡。法西釘爲鐡絲釘。採辦時令每在歲暮年初。最遲至四五月。過此則爲停頓時期交易有現欵。有期欵。均在談判時訂明。茶棧帮所辦之貨。爲山地茶商所經辦。欵由茶棧帮代墊。是以茶棧帮於購貨時有一種扣頭。（卽經手費爲九九五扣及九九七五扣）惟亦有不扣。故賣主力面。苟不預先聲明。鮮不有誤。本埠同業做此種生意者。爲可熾義昌裕祥隆等數家而已。</p>

<h3>「給他們看什麽好呢？」</h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>孩子一年一年大起來，在玩具菓餌而外，便又要求着「精神的食糧」了。七八歲的孩子，還容易對付；我們有「兒童世界」「小朋友」等等刊物。到十一二歲時，他們對於狗哥哥貓妹妹的故事旣繠　感興味，而又看不懂一般的文藝讀物。於是爲父母者就非常之窘。</p>
<p>著作家早已看到這一點。世界少年文學叢書之類便應此要求而出版。但是一則，數量不多，二則，譯文偏於歐化，所以孩子們的强烈的智識饑荒還是不能滿足。結果，他們就自尋「出路」：程度較高的就去扒舊書堆，七俠五義，水滸，西游記，還算是好的，等而下之，就連施公案，濟公傳，一切武俠的迷信的，全部吞下去了；程度較低的孩子呢，把「連環圖畫小說」當作寳貝。這樣自己發見了「新天地」的孩子們就更加覺得「寳島」「金河王」之類沉悶難懂，不對胃口了。</p>
<p>「給他們看什麽好呢？」有思想的父母光景是常常這麽焦慮的罷。</p>
<p>有些人眼光很高，以爲七俠五義等等封建意識的舊小說固然有毒，即如「寳島」等等西洋少年文學也是不衛生的，所以孩子們在現今簡直是無書可讀。這話自然不錯。就可惜我們不能因噎廢食。並且孩子們會偷偷地去租看各種「毒物，」任何方法都禁阻不了。</p>
<p>我覺得目前救急的辦法是丨丨</p>
<p>熱心兒童文學的朋友聯合起來研究他們的釋著何以不受兒童的熱烈喜愛。</p>
<p>選定比較「衛生」的材料，有計畫地或編或譯；但無論是編是譯，不千萬不要文字太歐化。</p>
<p>這是兩個原則。至於具體的辦法，自然有待於充分的討論。家裏有孩子嚷着「要書看」的人們和編譯兒童讀物的作者哟！難道眼前這問題不値得注意麽？</p>
<h3>人造地震</h3>
<p>— 適夷</p>
<p>蕭伯納在日本和荒木陸相會面時，荒本對他說：「可惜你老先生没有在日本遇到地震，遇到過地震，纔會懂得日本優越的國民性呢。」蕭老頭子的回答是：「假使你是英國的丙閣總理，一定會把炸彈埋在地下，製造人造地震的。」</p>
<p>荒木大將雖然没有到中國來當主席，但中國現在確有不少的人在加工趕製人造的地震。</p>
<p>少必說那些舶來的，「國貨」的飛機，炸彈，坦克軍，没一天不在「邊疆」與「腹地」轟轟隆隆的製造地震，就是泛濫而來的外國商品，匪夷所思的奇捐怪稅，又何嘗不是摇撼着農村的人造的地震。甘陜的人民因爲怕軍隊收房屋捐，不惜搗毁自己的住居，這地震已經是不待人造而自己來造了。軍隊因攻略而挖堤，土劣貪污尅扣公欵而置堤不修，形成環互十六省的大洪水，這更是接連着人造地震的人造海嘯了。</p>
<p>荒木以爲地震養成日本國民，優越性，是對外發展。在中國，這人造地震的結果，確也養成了對外發展的優越性，例如内地的地主搬家到租界裏作寓公，拿財産存到外國銀行的保險庫裏去便是。不過有些無家可搬，無産可存的人，似乎就無法養成這種優越性，祗好永遠在人造地震裏呻吟。</p>
<p>於是有人說：這是「註定了的苦命。」旣然「苦命」是「註定了」的，就祇好恭候山崩地裂，壓榨得粉身碎骨爲止吧！</p>
<h3>早市</h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍</p>
<p>每天早上，這。城的幾條熱鬧的街頭巷尾總是流動着那麽多的人：各種各樣的工屬於不同的階級的人們，像下雨前的螞蟻搬家一樣地蠕動。是夏天了，南風和早曙的天，把人們更早地推到街上來。</p>
<p>小販們絡續從鄕下或碼頭上挑着擔子走來，氣喘喘地，對先來的微笑着，這微笑和急促的動作中暗示着些微的疚悔：來晚了呵。賣筍的，賣魚的，賣蔬菜的……散在各處，每個人在熱切地期望着走向自己跟前來的雇客，也總是儘可能地温和地抓住他或她，如果賣價已到了題兒的時候。那一聲「好的，發發利南吧，賣給你！」裏面埋藏着人生的眞諦丨人們是要掙扎着活下去的丨·於是秤桿子忙了起來，小販認眞地計算幾斤幾兩和多少銅子，這是比坐在研究室裏的　者還要聚精會神的。這裏没有嬉笑和頑皮，人們是在「認眞」地活動。</p>
<p>每個提籃子的顧客都在忙碌地尋找着：精明的主婦在找那價廉物美的食品，廚子們在細心地計算着怎樣迎合主人的脾胃，被生活緊壓着的穿着襤　的人們在獨個兒商量怎樣配合那僅有的一些銅子的食糧和菜蔬。</p>
<p>人人脚象躺在簍子裏的鼈一樣緩慢地爬。開着舖板門的徒弟們，帶着油垢的臉望着街上過往的人發呆。挑擔者的吆喝聲，呌破了早上的淸靜空氣。車夫們嚼着大餅油條在等待生意。</p>
<p>一切都像在替有福的人打算，掃街的，倒馬桶的，收柴灰的，以及倒「乾水」的，都是永遠不會被遲起的富人看見討厭的。</p>
<p>可是這些遲起的富人，却也永遠没有機會看到這早市的種種生動的圖畫！</p>
<h3>小黑姑娘</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>我認識小黑姑娘，（不作「小黑姑娘認識我」解）遠在十二年前，那時她大約十六七歲。她的妹妹和弟弟都在我所主持的滄笙公學讀書。</p>
<p>老殘遊記中的白妞說書太使我們憧憬了，聽說新世界有黑姑娘說書，就冒充風雅坐在前排去喝茶聽書，「山東人吃麥冬」，半點也不懂；只聽得高處抛一個尖，低處沉入九淵，急時「嘈嘈切切」，緩時「間關流鶯一，彷彿有劉鶚筆底那個白妞的影子。佩弦先生說大世界的白雲鵬可稱一時名手；我只覺得白雲鵬的氣度很雍雅，别的一點也不懂。恰巧Ｗ君在新世界辦事，我們可以從邊門進出，得閑常去聽黑姑娘的書。</p>
<p>不久，黑姑娘宣告下野，小黑姑娘瓜代其職；黑姑娘年紀並不老，小黑姑娘的技巧又生澀軟弱，相差得太遠，不知爲什麽一個要告休，而由這麽一個小孩子打頭陣？小黑姑娘的眼睛是烏溜溜的，一上塲滴溜一轉，接着有幾處彩聲隨之而起。這種情形，那是黑姑娘說書時所没有的；先前每有幾個年老的在唱得入神時喝彩，這回變成許多年靑的在眼光流注時喝彩了。小黑姑娘上場後某一個晚上，Ｎ君呌我去聽書，說：「今晚新世界格外熱閙。一一進塲，果然黑壓壓地一屋子人，小黑姑娘專刊滿塲飛舞；小黑唱一句，台下喝一聲彩。那晚的書，唱得並不情彩，彩聲之多，則爲向來所未有。台上有三五隻花藍，横的直的有十來幅屏條，總是恭維楊ＸＸ女士「三日繞梁」，「高山流水」。小黑姑娘那晚的眼珠格外發亮，格外溜得快。</p>
<p>有一天，小黑姑娘送她的弟妹到滄笙公學來上課，才知道她原來往在近鄰；黑姑娘也時常可以看見。久面久之，才知道說書也不是一件有趣的事，每餐只能吃半碗一碗，每天吃十來頓；晚間總得四更時分纔能入寢，有堂會時每每熬到天明。精神不繼，助以鴉片，衰老得更快。每到一個碼頭，總得奉候當地「紳士」，「豪族」，「評劇職業人」，得他們的歡心。黑姑娘和小黑姑娘都是不識字的；渥承照顧，才有小黑姑娘專刊和秘本黑姑娘大鼓詞的出現。（眞的秘本，乃是一扣七八成别字的破摺子。）「牡丹雖好，全靠綠葉扶持一，說書的姑娘，一半靠本领，一半還靠「本领以外」。「小黑迷」的高君，他問「小黑」：「好」「好」那麽喝彩，你聽了不肉麻嗎？」小黑呆了半天，說：「你們做文章的，不要靠别人喝彩的嗎？」這一下，把高君難住了。</p>
<p>小黑姑娘專刊飛舞以後，小黑的聲名騰起，很快很快地變成很大很大的「红角」，大家也就漸漸忘記黑姑娘了。恰巧陳樹藩將軍從陜西掮地皮到上海來享福，英雄與美人，了却一段因緣，據說小黑姑娘的說書技術，也就「竿頭日上，爐火純靑」了！</p>
<p>前幾天，在北平書塲看見小黑姑娘，氣派大不相同；花藍擺得密密層層，「三日繞梁」，「高山流水」的屏條總有三五百幅，掛印拜帥，好一個台柱子！門外豎着「客滿」二個大字，乃不禁又想起「黑姑娘」來！我曾經有一個呆想：想起老殘遊記作者於地下而問之，「當年白妞何如？」</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— julesrenard作林取譯</p>
<p>奥洛林</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨你現在究竟有多少年紀了，奥洛林？</p>
<p>奥洛林丨從十一月一號起，已經滿了六十七歲。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨那麽你已經老了啦，可憐的奥洛林！</p>
<p>奥洛林丨祗要我們還能工作，那是一點也不覺得老的。我從來不曾病過。我覺得馬都没有我這樣結實呢。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨你願意我告訴你一宗事情嗎，奥洛林？你會突然死去的。某天傍晚，從河邊回來，你會覺得你的背籃太重，小車也不像平常那樣容易推動；你會跪倒在兩支車臂之間、鼻子挿在那些洗過了的衣裳上面，於是你便完了。等到人家把你抱起來的時候，早已斷了氣了。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨你說笑話啦；請不要害怕罷；我的腿和臂還很健呢。</p>
<p>電臂克家的丨你的背稍許蠻了一點，這是眞的，可是背彎下了的時候，洗衣裳就不會那樣感着腰酸的。但你的眼力衰弱起來了，這是多麽可惜的事情！你不要否認，奥洛林！這事我就看出來了。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨啊！我的眼晴還同我出嫁的時候一樣精明呢。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨好的！那麽你去打開碗櫃，拿一隻碟子給我，隨便那隻都可以。如果你曾把食器揩和十分乾凈的話，那麽那會有這層水氣呢？</p>
<p>奥洛林丨碗櫃裏面有些潮濕啦。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨難道碗櫃裏面也有一些手指在那些碟子上摸來摸去嗎？你看這個指印。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨在什麽地方，請你指給我，我一點都没有看見。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨這恰恰是我要怪你的地方啦，奥洛林。你聽我說。我並不怪你偷懶，如果我說這句話，那我便錯了；在我們這地方，我没有看見第二個女人像你這樣出力的；我不過說你老了罷了。我也一樣，我也老了；我們都老了，老了的時候，我們便會力不從心。我可以打賭：你一定常常覺得你的眼睛上像蒙着一層布一樣。你雖盡力揩擦，但它還是照舊蒙在你的眼睛上。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨可是我的眼睛可以睜得開開的，我並没有覺得頭像沉在水裏面一樣兩眼糢糊。雷辟克家的丨有的，有的，奥洛林，你可以相信我的話啦。昨天，你還拿了一隻酒杯髒給雷辟克先生。我没有說一句話，因爲我恐怕使你難過，並且引起一塲是非。雷辟克先生也一樣没有說一句話。他是從來不說什麽的，可是却没有一宗事情能夠逃過他的眼睛。人家以爲他不關心，這可錯啦！他觀察着一切，但却什麽都不顯露出來。他祗很隨便的用指頭把你的酒杯推開，並且他竟能單是吃着飯而不喝酒。我爲着你難過，同時也爲着他難過。</p>
<p>奥洛林丨雷辟克先生會在他自己的僕人面前拘東起來，這才怪啦！他祇要說一聲，我便會替他換一個杯子的。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨這話不錯，奥洛林，可是比你更狡猾的人也不能使得决意不開口的雷辟克先生講話的。這事連我現在都不願再試了。並且問題不在　這裏。簡括說：你的眼力一天一天的不行了。對於粗笨工作，如洗濯之類，雖還不十分要緊、但細巧的工作你便完全不行了。雖然開消要增加，我也寗願找個什麽人來帮帮你，如果……（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>疑問</h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>語曰「秀才不出門，能知天下事」，我畢竸拜服從前秀才的聰明，從前的秀才，還没有報紙看，而且是不出門，居然能知天下的事，我現在天天跑來跑去，天天揭開報紙來看，然而讀讀報紙上批露的新聞，不懂的地方很多，眞是漸愧得很，今天我隨便舉幾條出來，以資考究。</p>
<p>七日南京電，戴傳賢邀粤中大在京中師生七十餘人，合抄總理遺敎，盛以銅盒，外鑲石匣，於陵墓左近，築塔寳藏，以垂永久，七日晨八時，行奠基禮，石匣由塔頂以繩下繫時，中途繩斷匣碎，此一奇事。</p>
<p>總理遺敎，何等名貴，自應藏諸名山，傳之後世，築塔寳藏原非希奇的事但如此煌煌大典工具的設備必定審愼周密，何以竟至繩斷而石匣粉碎，殊爲不解。</p>
<p>又同日電監委高友唐，上月中旬向監院提彈劾張學良，竊取頣和園古畫案，内有「嗣經張繼嚴電追索，始承認存於天津租界，即使以後能原璧歸趙，張實已搆成刑法上之侵佔罪」云云，經該院發交李夢庚審查，認爲應即交付懲戒，已呈送國府交中央公務員懲戒會懲戒，此事亦有些奇怪。</p>
<p>張學良臨行時，同發覺盜竊案兩件，一件是盜賣海部醫院校址於某租界當局，一件是窮取頣和園古畫，現在監委高友唐僅提彈劾張學良竊取古畫，而對於盜賣海部醫院校地事，並不提及亦屬不解。</p>
<p>同日北平電，今晨有一中國靑年，入六國飯店某室，向一年老華人，開槍兩響，而重創之，即從容乘候於門外之汽車逃脫，受傷之客，客簿上之姓氏爲張世衡，（其實即張敬堯）即送入德國醫院，今日午後身死，所奇者，張氏本人否認曾遭槍擊，謂其傷乃觸電所致。</p>
<p>張敬堯身爲漢奸，自知罪大惡極，故改名爲世衡，即此次被人暗殺，亦只得自認晦氣，不好說出身爲漢奸，而致被人擊斃，這是漢奸在此氣如游絲時所發現一些天良未泯的痕迹，所以極力否認被人槍擊，但不解何以一般不肖的子女們，竟於張入殮時，居然紅頂花翎繡蟒大龍袍，裝得活龍活現是一個漢奸的樣子。定要一獻其臭，眞是不解。</p>
<h3>賣文生涯</h3>
<p>— 彭年</p>
<p>賣文丨是多麽難聽而又受人厭惡的名詞啊！</p>
<p>。　。但是現在所謂從大學裏出來的人，在這個「無處可以生我」的社會裏，確實難好找到比賣文生涯更好的地方，因之，社會上賴賣文而生活者，一天多似一天，報館的創辦，附刊的添設，也似雨笔春筍一般地發達起來，雖說這對於社會，對於國家，多少有點帮助；但也是文人日暮途窮時，唯一的生活藝術吧。</p>
<p>我因受生活的煎迫，又找不到「可以活我」的地方，爲了這兩個原因，使我只好走入賣文的蹊徑。而且賣文才能活我。現在我是惟文是生了報紙的附刊，就是我認爲最豐富的出産之地，也是我稱爲最寳貴無上「活我」的田園。</p>
<p>但賣文是很不容易的：嘔盡心血，絞盡腦汁，寫出五六百字，做成一篇文章，還要預付二分没有還價把握的郵花，才能寄到報館。可是編輯先生與你有緣與否？還是一個問题，即使抱了最大的希望，刋了出來，酬金至多也不過一元至二元之數，但這一元至二元酬金的代價，不知虧損我的心血多少呢！這還算好，有時做一篇文章，語氣必定要激烈一點，否則獲不到編輯先生的同情，但政府裏的大人們，偏偏不願諒你，說你是ＸＸ派，當即派幾個偵探來監視你，把你包圍，使你有行不得也哥哥之嘆！運氣不濟，有嘗鐡窗風味的危險。說不定請你吃顆衛生丸。劉煜生不是我們的前事嗎？</p>
<p>賣文，雖然這樣可怕！這樣痛苦！但我的口没有進益，肚子閙起風潮起來。呌我拿甚麽方法來征服它呢！爲了這點，我也顧不得許多了，只好讓身子鑽進槍林彈雨裏去，爲口打算了。</p>
<h3>小姐們沈默了</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>微暖的春風，顫動了大地的一切，雖屬是在春來較遲的大都市裏，雖屬是在門院重重的金屋裏，也可吻嗅着春的醇醪了，每早娘姨把窗扉推開，放入一股新的氣息，于是小姐們便慵懶的從被裏伸出半個頭蓋，「呵，可愛的春晨呀！」嬌聲幾句，便也較往常早些時爬下床了。</p>
<p>大小姐的芳齡，雖已過了二十，但還像正當花信的十六七歲的少女般的風情，這大概是没有結過婚的原故，伊已是大學三年級了，不但學會了鶯囀似的流利普通話，而且還會說英語，苗條的身材，襯托着白中帶紅的臉孔，水珠似的眼睛，小小的櫻唇，一舉一動，已夠嫵媚　娜了，而况是大學生，態度格外來得大雅，伊果然値得自驕，快樂。</p>
<p>二小姐雖還是中學生，但已是六年級了，芳齡剛剛十八，靑春的火燄，正猛烈的燃燒着伊的每個細胞，高度恰當的鼻梁，裞着萍果色的蛋形臉袋，兩撇細長的眉毛，藏蓋在秋水似的眼上，顧盼之間，果也夠人神盪魂消。</p>
<p>年輕的三小姐，還僅十六歲，然伊却也會說英語，因爲伊進的是一所敎會中學，滿臉的孩子氣，總是跳來跳去的不見伊靜止，伊雖不會像大小姐二小姐的善於冶裝，粉飾，却也流露着自然的少女美。</p>
<p>小姐們每日上學院了，便由一部一九三三式的福特汽車分頭接將轉來，跳進院子，轉上廳堂，院内的人工野景，頻向伊們微笑，廳上陳列着的花卉，展枝振葉的賦着迎迓之曲，小姐們卸下了外衣，便是任性的談笑，一忽兒大小姐敎導三小姐唱英文歌，隨着是一塲翩翩的舞蹈，一忽兒又打開着留聲機唱機齣像「ＩＬＯＶＥＹＯＵ」，「大軍進行曲」一類的西洋名曲，轉而一度吃喝，又一陣談笑，伊們是沈醉在人間的天堂了，果然歡樂，美滿。</p>
<p>黄昏臨了，窗外響透着報販的嘶呌，小姐們猛然憶起了看電影的夜課，大小姐到底是大學生，却說要看了夜報才去，于是娘姨立地買來了一張夜報。</p>
<p>空氣誠然轉換得迅速；充滿了整室的歡樂之潮，頃刻便全消落了，小姐們面面相覷，大家沈默了，虧得娘姨站在旁邊，怎樣也猜不出道不破這悶葫蘆的究竟，「這樣美滿的小姐生活，而竟也愁眉皺臉起來了，眞有些辜負！寃枉！」娘姨默念着，不由的破口冷笑了一聲，惹得大小姐火上心肝，狠狠地駡道：「不懂事的瘟貨，滚出去吧！」</p>
<p>然而愁雲還是籠罩着小姐們的每個面孔，表現着没法排解的無限苦悶，伊們是痛惡暴日的横蠻麽，不是！是追悼被難的同胞麽，不是！是眼看着國勢阽危，國土喪失，深恨執掌軍權的武人不知捍衛國家麽，不是！是看了塘山路ＸＸ工廠炸死了成百的勞工，表示惋嘆麽，都不是！</p>
<p>爲的是大小姐的情人在失陷了的熱河朝陽，可眞不知是歹是好，而且平津也臨了嚴重的局勢，二小姐三小姐的愛人，不都正在危險線上的北平城裏麽！</p>
<h3>聚餐會</h3>
<p>— 立民</p>
<p>是華燈初上的時候了，汽車嗚嗚，人聲嘈嘈，分外顯露出城市之夜的熱閙。</p>
<p>「一品香，一枝香，杏花樓，桃花宫·」這許多都市中巍峨的酒家，坐滿了富家的公子哥兒，那粉紅色的箋子飛去，停一回兒便有十七八歲的大姑娘飛來。</p>
<p>公子哥兒就這樣聚了一頓餐：呌了幾個局；窮落戶便足夠半年的敷衍！</p>
<p>桃花宫後面，一條從來不放光明的道途上；在這裏建築着一條一條的弄堂</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，告訴你這是文明底都市中神女的歸宿地，的確；亞堂裏籠罩不少神秘色彩！</p>
<p>在這時候：一條弄堂的遇街樓下，有五個大少爺化身的文明乞丐！屁股貼地的圍坐着！圓卓會議？没有桌！聚餐會？有一些兒像：</p>
<p>文明乞丐的年紀都很輕！面孔的瘦削而還帶着菲律賓的濃厚的色彩！紅綠破布和粗細麻袋縫合成的什錦衣服，穿在各人的身上；活像玄妙觀裏的小道士。</p>
<p>「請：請；我們大家請，」這幾個文明乞丐！嘴裏都這樣說着，筷子也隨意的朝地上平放着幾隻洋鐡罐頭裏落去；但是絲毫没有窮兇極惡的樣子。</p>
<p>他們吃了這一筷，便又停着講話了：</p>
<p>「這一次聚餐，比較上次快樂得多。」</p>
<p>「是呀；這都是衆弟兄的努力成績！」</p>
<p>「你們一說；我覺得又塞悚起來了！險呀！昨天我在申報館門口飯擔裏倒黄魚的辰光，幾乎被紅頭鬼子捉住！」</p>
<p>「我前天在泥城橋倒冷飯！還給外國猢猻打了一下呢！」</p>
<p>「大家如此的；這些東西都是歷險而來！」</p>
<p>「不錯！歷險而來的東西味道格外覺得好！」</p>
<p>這幾個文明乞丐就這樣你一句；我一言的談論着，幾隻洋鐡罐頭裏的佳肴！也漸漸的低下去丨這當兒；忽然有一個文明乞丐從身上摸出了一個紙包，拿在手裏說道：「我昨天在一家公館門前，拾到了許多花兒！可惜這花兒！都給他們弄得快死了！我把它拾來！很謹愼的用報纸包好，現在我拿出來給弟兄們賞鑒賞鑒，可不能動手！」說罷；果然解開紙包，原來却是幾朶白蘭花！</p>
<p>月姊現出了笑靨，漸漸升至天空居中，城市之夜的囂雜，也慢慢的岑寂下來！一條弄堂的過街樓下，横七豎八睡着幾個文明乞丐！幾條鼾聲和合在一起，遇着微風激盪起來，打破弄堂内夜的蕭瑟！</p>
<h3>某大學的宿舍室裏</h3>
<p>— 璞如</p>
<p>一屋子裏的笑鬧聲，一屋子裏的脚步聲，一屋子裏的京胡子聲：丨西皮，二簧，倒板，……在粉白的宿舍室裏，在乳白的電燈光下，三張床，四張卓子，一只凌亂的小書架，卓上一只熱水瓶，一架留聲機，和一堆散亂的紙，幾枝筆，倒着的墨水瓶，一幀女人的像，像後面寫着「我的心呀」，「吻吧，盡情的」！………</p>
<p>「喂，你今天看的什麽片子」？</p>
<p>「春風楊柳，丨你呢」？</p>
<p>「失戀」。</p>
<p>「怎樣？」</p>
<p>「情表得好哇」！</p>
<p>穿西裝的，穿長袍的，否戴帽的，架眼鏡的，還有穿睡衣的，擠擠一室。跳着的，站着的，坐着的，有長子，有矮子，有小白臉，有黑羅漢，……</p>
<p>「喂，老陳，你唱，四郎探母」。</p>
<p>「喂，拉呀，老鄭！慢板西皮」。</p>
<p>於是，京胡子，一下兒變了調兒。　　「楊延輝，坐……宫……」穿長袍的老陳唱起來了由四郎探母唱到馬前潑水，再唱到二進宫……</p>
<p>「好哇！」大家喝啋了。</p>
<p>「不唱了，聲帶吃不消」。</p>
<p>「好，我來，！你把那……阿……阿……」</p>
<p>「不行，老李來」。</p>
<p>「不拉了吧，我們開留聲機」。</p>
<p>把留聲機箱打開，機器開足，一張又一張的唱去。大家在旁邊附和着唱。　　「呃，這個倒板唱得多好」！摇摇頭。</p>
<p>「這，阿，阿，阿……拖音唱得多皮俏」！拍着脚拍。</p>
<p>他們都在驚嘆不已。</p>
<p>只有穿睡衣的鷹鈎籚　子的小徐，獨個在那兒跳舞；没趣，去拉大頭老朱來合跳，抱着身兒，脚在地板上拖。接着截歪帽的老黄，架眼鏡的老李，紅西裝的老周，小白臉的小吳，黑羅漢的阿秦，都要跟他跳，擁着他的腰，牽着他的手……黑羅漢不會跳，他指示他的錯誤，和敎他應當如何跳。</p>
<p>跳着，京胡子又拉了起來，怪流利的。留聲機仍在阿，阿，阿，哐，哐，哐，黑弄里東……的唱着，只是聲音被人的吵鬧聲壓得很低，幾乎聽不出來了。</p>
<p>跳着，高唱着，狂笑着，戲打着，……</p>
<p>門一開，瞇瞇眼老胡進來了，抱一抱留聲機片子，拿一包花生米兒。</p>
<p>「ＧＫＫＤＮＩＧＨＴＬＦＯＯＤＮＩＧＨＴＬ」穿睡衣的鷹鈎鼻的小徐，丢下黑羅漢，迎上去。</p>
<p>「呵，呵，老胡！……」</p>
<p>哄地一聲，大家搶上去，先把花生米兒搶光了。京胡也不拉了，大家都笑着。</p>
<p>「喂，你拿的什麽片子」？</p>
<p>「外國舞片，外國舞片」。</p>
<p>「好，我們掉片子吧」。</p>
<p>機器開足，把外國舞片放上去。</p>
<p>「來來來，還是我倆是對手」。</p>
<p>鷹鈎鼻子的小徐，便同瞇瞇眼老胡跳起來。電燈用綠紙蒙起來，綠陰陰的，於是便成了他們的舞場。</p>
<p>外國片子唱着，他倆擁着，跳着：什麽華爾支，什麽狐步……</p>
<p>他們的舞場，稍靜了下來。都羨慕地瞧着：跳得俏皮！</p>
<p>看到人家跳得好，手癢脚癢日於是，拉京胡子的老鄭，和歪戴帽的老黄，架眼鏡的老李，和大頭老朱：紅西裝的老周，和小白臉的小吳：穿長袍的老陳，和黑羅漢：都擁着，一對一對的，跳起來，擠擠一室。有長子，有矮子，有小白臉，有黑羅漢………</p>
<p>跳着，跳着，微笑着，唱着外國歌舞片，綠陰陰的。……</p>
<p>忽然，電燈熄了一下，又亮了，又熄了一下，亮了。結果是終於熄了。</p>
<p>「呵，電燈熄了」。</p>
<p>「弄不成了」。</p>
<p>一聲喝，哄然而散</p>
<p>走廊裏，響起了答答的鞋聲。各回到自己的宿舍室裏，黑黑的。</p>
<p>「喂，你們明天考什麽」？</p>
<p>「又是他媽的法文哪」。</p>
<p>「我們明天還要考民法和土地法呢」。</p>
<h3>怎樣做人的討論</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>這一個世界是一個弱肉强食的世界，這一個世界是一個詭詐的世界，中國人不堪，外國人也壞，鄙人覺得我們有研究和討論怎樣做人的必要，就是這一個世界是一個相親相愛的世界，這一個世界是一個公正的世界，我們也應當研究和討論怎樣做人，我們可以在這世界上相處，從前本附刊的佛先生講處世藝術，我想他是憤世嫉俗。</p>
<p>討論怎樣做人，第一個問題是我們做善人，還是做惡人好，我覺得我們還是做善人好，因爲我們自己不喜歡别人惡待我們，别人以詭詐待我們，别人偷成盜我們的東西：我們自己不喜歡和品行不良的人相交；我們自己看見了品行不良的人蹙額，這種品行不良的人是到處此路不通，孔子說，已所弗欲，弗施於人是不錯的，或者有人說，做惡人，可以佔便宜，比方我們和别人交易，用了重秤，我們可以佔得便宜，講道德，做好人則没有便宜佔了，我想這人是短視！他不知道，假使他處處這樣做人，或者他還不會到一步，人人和他絶交，他也要狠難立足於社會了：他所得的便宜是少而暫時的，他所吃的虧是多而久長的。</p>
<p>我們現在討論怎樣做一個善人，我們從孔孟的書籍可以得帮助，孔孟和别人碩儒都是文學大家而處世術大家，有一位老先生說，道通天地有形外，思入風雲變態中，他的處世術是多麽高明！這位老先生是程顥老先生，老殘遊記和鏡花缘被世人認爲好書，他們的作者都是知過處世術的。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<p>而今我知道　手是不能惹的</p>
<p>编者先生：</p>
<p>我深知先生能解答一切疑難問题，故抱着千萬分的誠意，請先生給我一個滿意答覆。</p>
<p>我是滬西，曹家渡某烟紙店的學徒，到店將近一年。我們的店，位在公共汽車的站上。所以掱手亦應運而生。最近一月，在店前欲哭無滬者，已數見不鮮。於五日前，竊本店熟客（俗名老生意）陽傘一頂：又於二日前，竊另一熟客，皮夾一只，計値洋念元左右。據云，此念元者，乃將到期之債務也，若不歸還，則譏笑辱駡，實難忍受。余睹狀；余見其形跡可疑也，乃注視之。後來一誠懇老實的鄕人，此人即邁步趨上，以所載禮帽，遮閉手面，而使用輕手術入袋掱取。此時也，余乃高呼掱手；鄕人警覺，而掱手亦知事不成，怒目揚臂以去。左右見此者，不止予一人。然皆抱人不犯我，我不犯人的不抵抗主義。嗚呼，世道如此，夫復何言。</p>
<p>事後朋儕中有贊我養勇者，有譏我多管閒事者，一有代我担憂，恐被小人暗算者。光陰以電一般的過去，夜之神降臨了。明早起身，有人告我曰：貴店明燈，「業已打得精光」。於是議論紛紛，或謂小人本不可與之爭鋒，或謂區區小竊，何足掛齒。但我心中已大大不安，因片言而殃及店中，於心能無愧乎。而今而後，我才知掱手是不能惹的。本店位於共公汽車站上，生意頗好每日早晨五時起，到夜裏十二時睡覺。在十二點前，未聞有任何龐大聲音，明早則門燈落地，可證是燈落地之時，必在十二點後，五時前也。按此時店内各人，固入睡鄕，然　立街頭之巡捕警察，豈竟亦未之聞耶。</p>
<p>先生啊，嚕嚕囌囌的言語，已多極了。現在總括的問一句，小竊究應如何對付！臨危而不救，於心不忍，反之，則多生枝節，非獨結恨個人，且累及店中。特此上函，敬請明示。（下略）湯鐡錚上</p>
<p>編者按：「人民應竭其全力，帮助政府，阻止犯罪行爲的發生」。各國的法律，都有這樣的規定。所以你看見一個掱手，正在偷竊人家的東西，要是不設法阻止，論理是犯罪的。不過中國的法律，因爲制定這法律的人，不免受了「各人自掃門前雪，莫顧他家瓦上霜」的傳統遣毒，没有把這層意思，明白的規定下來。尤其是聰明的過的上海人，他們眞董得處世藝術，人不犯我，我不犯人。即使看見一個人，將要被人打死，他竟也會不顧而去。掱手偷東西，値得什麽呢？在普通人抱這種態度，嚴格說起來，已經是不行了。最可嘆的，一般負有防止肖小責任的警政人員，竟亦自高身價，對於不法的掱手，不敢得罪。</p>
<p>照這樣下去，我敢斷定，在不久的將來，上海一定會變成一個掱毛世界呢！所以我們對於湯君這次的舉動，非常佩服；至於累及店東，那是偶然的事。正人尅邪，這般掱手，究屬不能十分難爲你們的。而且掱手時常光顧到你們老主顧身上於營業不無應嚮，稍微的犧牲，也不足顧慮。我們還要勸勸一般人們，大家都起來這樣做，那末掱手就可以絶跡。同時負有防止肖小的警政人員，也要切實的負起責任來，不要再眼開眼閉。最後希望在修訂刑法時，照其他各國的先例，把「我民應竭其全力，帮助政府，阻止犯罪行爲的發生。」明白地規定進去。</p>

<h3>五姬的一生（六）（續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>六「你看你這胸窩裏的毛啊」！</p>
<p>那是　　春　的　　　　　　　很暖　　人們的身上都脫下了灰鼠而換上了珍珠皮袍，不過在白天，頭上還不免要出汗的。</p>
<p>柳姑娘家裏的大門口，從昨天起便紮了好些紅綠布，今天晚上除了正大門懸上一　　明的煤氣燈以外，還點着兩只足有八方的玻璃燈籠。不過這都是在北京城常時可以看見的，並不見如何了不起的堂皇，所以許多從她家走過的人們，總以爲裏面任在做着什麽喜事，但是並不會感覺到裏面是了不起的寛绰，其實在武貴看來，確是不應當僅是僅樣點缀的，像她的老爺旣是這樣有錢，　什麽不多一些錢在門前熱閙熱閙的。可是據老爺的意思，在京城裏是不便過於誇張的，给外面說出去，到底不大好聽。這一點，當然是武貴不大懂得的。　　但是你若走到柳姑娘的房裏去，那却大不同了。許多傢具都是紫檀的，而且椅背上都挖空雕花，嵌上滿畫着水墨山水的江西瓷板。牀是不必說，那放着金光的銅柱上，只消用手指輕輕的扃敲一下，便會發出淸膽的聲音。</p>
<p>除此以外，白牆壁上還掛了紅緞子的喜幛，並且不只一幅，其他也有横屏和對聯之類。</p>
<p>這一天一晚眞是熱閙得很，吃過正式喜酒之後又是打牌，一共同四桌。因爲大家都吸着紙烟的原故，不管是三砲台或是雙刀牌，可是濃重的烟霧總是會到處瀰漫，甚至於薰得柳姑娘用帕揩着眼涙。這時候便有一個一雙眼睛生得怪小的人打趣她說：</p>
<p>「什麽？筱柳爲什麽要哭呀？你不歡喜章大爺嗎？你别小看他，現在洪憲皇帝馬上登基，章大爺和他的妻舅最爲要好，你看他將來少不了做一個部長給你看哩。」</p>
<p>本來柳姑娘是坐在章大爺腿上替他打牌的，看上去似乎很是開心，可是經這人一陣玩笑，可少不了自他懷裏站起來走開了。其實誰也知道她不會哭。　　客人們終於走了，房子裏有一般怪難聞的人身上所特有的臭味，於是她推開了靠街的一扇窗戶，立刻在淸凉的空氣中流進一股女人的嘩笑聲，那都是到這裏出堂差的剛剛回去。</p>
<p>章大爺送这人出了大門，馬上跑進房來，用力的摟住她，瘋狂的吻了一陣，似乎在說：</p>
<p>「現在我總到手了吧！」</p>
<p>「你看你這胸窩裏的毛啊！」她低聲的和章大爺說。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈！」章大爺是一陣狂笑。一股酒味　在她的臉上。</p>
<p>這時已經天亮了。</p>

<p>電影專刊</p>
<h3>影片究竟是怎樣起始的？（上）</h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>這裏有一個比較準確的答案！</p>
<p>關於影片的原始，曾有很多不同的記載：而對於影片的原始發明人，也是論調不一，這裏有一個人，從各方面考察起來，他確應該享受這榮譽的。他的名字威廉佛里斯格靈WILLIAMFRIESEGREENE，是倫敦一位照相師，他的兒子克羅德佛里斯格靈CLAUDEFRIESEGREENE，近在英國國際影片公司服務，是現代英國最著名的攝影家，下面就是他所寫的一篇關於原始影片狀况的東西。</p>
<p>影片在現代，雖然已經成了人們生活素中的主要部份，但是很少有人去注意它是怎樣起始的。你隨便去問那一個影迷，影片發明於何時：誰是發明人；關於最早的有聲片片樣，一定可以得到許多光怪陸離的答案，關於影片的發明人，許多年來，仍在辯論中。我可以造訴你，我的父親威廉佛里斯格靈，是第一個申請和得着影戲攝影機的專利特許證的，這是一八八九年六月裏的事情，他還接着得獲攝製影片的專利特　證，並且，他在一八八五年，就在無意中，發現了活動影片的秘密了。</p>
<p>一八八廾年，我的父親，曾懷孕着一種觀念，就是把愛迪生發明的留聲機，和攝影怎樣聯合起來。從這時起，就經年累月的研究着，想去實現他的理想，到了一八八九年，他還把這種計畫，寫給愛迪生，想請這位美國人，和他合作攝製有聲影片，愛迪生是乖巧的，對於這件事，當然感覺有十分興趣，他就來信要求把那特式攝影機的圖案送寄他，但是從此以後，就没有信來了。</p>
<p>我父親自幼對於攝影就深感趣味，肯去研究，至一八八二年，復與約翰亞塞爾合力去做。亞塞爾曾發明一種射影燈，可以繼續着攝取景物，我的父親，對於活動影片的觀念，就是從這個燈上發生的，關於亞塞爾的發明，他復加以種種的糾正。到了一八八五年，還在英國攝影協會中去開過展覽會，亞塞爾就在這時候死了，但是我的父親，仍舊繼續研究下去。</p>
<p>此後兩年，他仍舊很努力的去研究和改良，他本是倫敦一位非常著名的攝影師，以他的名望和信譽，有一次在實騐室裏舉行他的「活動影片」「展覽時，竟因觀衆過於擁擠而引起警察的干涉，（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評愛姆敦戰</h3>
<p>— 史明</p>
<p>劇本尙有可取</p>
<p>演出平庸鬆懈</p>
<p>「愛姆敦戰史」CIUISEREMDEN在卡爾登公映了，滿産觀衆之中嗶嘰倒有一半是各國的水手們。牠是德國一家很出名的EMELKASTUOIO公司出口。</p>
<p>雖然這是三年前的舊作，但是牠因爲是歷史劇，所以牠的意識上還没有什麽可指爲落伍或跟不上潮流的地方。劇情無甚可談，只是對於「愛姆敦」號戰艦由靑島出發，一直到被英艦「史丹尼」擊燬沉没爲止，在前兩本略挿入一點愛情的故事，但是微乎其微。</p>
<p>牠自始至終是在詛駡戰爭的罪惡和殘酷，起首就是軍兵别妻離子的去上火線，很努力的寫出生離死别的慘狀。穿挿的一段情史，正是說無論在什麽環境下「愛」是永久給人自私的，牠坦白地暴露了人與人的關係。這影片裏又充份述到德國軍士猛撲火熖，捨身救艦的精神。當然，德國的製片宣傳德國的勇敢沉毅，確是很明顯的。</p>
<p>導演LOUISRALPH是大大的失敗了，很好的史料，他只能平平的說出一件故事，而没有能力去溶化牠，使牠成爲一種藝術品。分幕，更是雜亂無章，呌人須漲眼花，有時連到這一幕是德國人或敵軍丨英國人丨也認不淸楚。軍艦先已大火，旋又無火，終則全部被焚，次序上有了很大的漏洞。</p>
<p>攝影的確是運用了不少新奇的角度，但是變化太少，例如攝海「水」有十次之多，排列如出一轍，呌人很覺厭倦的。小鏡頭太多，所以瑣碎非常，没一幕能有細膩的表演。海戰專取遠景，殊覺乏味。光線是日光，還算淸楚。發音平常，德語對白，在中國懂的人太少，也是令人掃興的一個原因。至於佈景，内景外景都還好，不過「愛姆敦」被燬一幕，太明顯地露　是假做的。大火一塲却可以說很緊張。</p>
<p>發揮民族精神的悲壯巨片</p>
<p>友聯出品「和平之花」徐琴芳飾</p>
<p>在「愛姆敦」進行時，海中出現新式驅逐艦三隻，這種戰艦，完全是一九二五年以後的，一九一四年絶對没有，這也是一個很大的時間性疏怱。</p>
<p>用地圖表示「愛姆敦」的行程，很巧妙，不過據實際說，牠一路上破壞各種船隻達四十二艘之多，現在影片中，旣然盡力簡省，地圖上也絲毫不提，殊有失實之嫌。</p>
<p>在這片裏另有一個優點，就是海軍的組織法，大約導演和演員，都有很　的經騐。但可惜除被燬以外，寫戰爭太少了一些。</p>
<p>演員，一個個主要的是在作戰，配角團體工作，還算不錯。</p>
<h3>評「女諸葛」ALADYS　PROTESSION</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>假如就「女諸葛」的譯名而言，那末少不了以爲這位太太一定是「神機妙算」，「袖裏」大有「乾坤」，自然是「運籌於帷幄之中，决勝於千里之外」的了，但是化了一元錢聚精會神的領敎一番之後，這位諸葛太太，並不能使我們怎樣的甘拜下風。</p>
<p>其實，這是一部派拉蒙的「普通」的片子。假使我們一定要絞盡腦汗的給牠抓出一點意義上的優點，那末本片的作者對於没落的男爵，紳士們的以酒爲第二生命（在禁酒時期中拚命的偷着喝酒），卑鄙的販酒商等等，都是予以輕描淡寫的嘲笑。但是這種嘲笑决不是奴僕對於主人的「非正人君子」的態度表示不滿，而是低心下氣跪在主人的「足下」說：「親愛的主人喲，你好好的給祖先爭氣起來罷，老主人的過去的光榮還需要你來發揚光大呢！」不過這種叩頭打躬是否就能夠「挽狂瀾於旣倒」，而「奠定家邦」呢？倒是一個大疑問。</p>
<p>故事的結構，總算是還能夠自圓其說。靑年男女，一見生情，固然是美國片最得意的筆法，在本片中當然也少不了這一套。但是情話，擁抱，和秘密結婚，根據過去的經騐，到底是可以賺錢的。</p>
<p>導演確實爲本片十分努力，你看罷，他居然將這樣的一個故事變成這樣的一部電影了。爲的要使飽暖的人們，到電影院裏來娱樂一塲，於是便將可笑的對白說得特别響亮。動作的「噱頭」白然是更有必要，於是一個矮子用小刀雕刻自來水筆或STICK以及馬蹄踏穿了紳士的高帽，「這多少也有點諷剌的意味），便不惜一而再，再而三的攝了又攝，這種笑料，根本就「可笑」得很。</p>
<p>「老氣横秋，不可一世」的「老明星」亞麗遜史基浮絲（ALISONSKIPWORTH），固然是「老氣」得可以，表演得也不壞，和主演「女政治家」等笑片的瑪琳特蘭漱，總算難分彼此，但也不一定就居然「不可一世」。主演過「福水」的洛萊楊（ROLANDYCUNG）在這裏仍是令人哭笑不得。飾富翁的GEORGEBARBIER倒是很耐人尋味的。莎麗曼莉薩（SARIMARITGA）的確很漂亮得可以，雖然表演不見成功</p>
<p>收音有時嗓亂得可以。佈景還過得去。……總之，這是一部平庸的片子。</p>
<p>喬治勃倫脫的</p>
<p>目光前途暗淡梅邨</p>
<p>關於喬治勃倫脫的目光發生危險，在好萊塢已傳說得好久了。他們對這位愛爾蘭歌劇家遭遇這樣不幸的事件，似乎覺得很惋惜，尤其是他現正在影界裏享着盛名的當兒。</p>
<p>唯的原因，據說受了KLEIGLIGHTS的作祟，但是另一方面也怪他少年時代看書過度而没有注意所種下的禍根。　　喬治自從到了美國做舞臺上的生活。因爲他是主角，每個星期必須熟讀脚本。於是强烈的燈光把目光的伸縮力常常照耀得疲憊不堪，致於發現停滯的狀態，而日間在太陽光之下，他也没有用黑眼鏡保護他的眼睛，所以目光也就更退了。</p>
<p>當他發覺他目光的困惱後，想藉以休養一個時期，但事有這樣凑巧不過的，華納公司的老　適在這時看中了他，央求他加入電影界，一說起電影，他早有這個志願了，當然欣然承諾。把那件休養大事，却丢在腦後了。屢次做察德登司丹妃瓊勃朗黛兒勞萊妲楊等女主角的對手，聲譽就日漸響亮了。</p>
<p>可是，他的目光病也有增無已，去年和察德登結婚後，她曾勸他休養，但電影的興趣和各譽始終迷戀着他，結果，僅僅請了一位醫師做他的顧問。</p>
<h3>「脂粉市場」公映有期</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>因爲「自由之花」的公映，胡蝶獲得了更多的觀衆的傾倒，現在她繼「自由之花」以後第二部主演的聲片「脂粉市場」，不久也將公映了。</p>
<p>胡蝶女士在「脂粉市場」裏，飾的是一個半封建的小家碧玉，因爲環境的逼迫，不得不謀求職業，因而跑進了一個百貨公司，做女職員。可是一入社會，許多意外的糾紛就重重地包圍了她，使她雖盡了壁。裏面有女職員的爭風吃醋，小開與公司監督的荒唐淫樂等等描寫，暴露的力量可說是極有力的。</p>
<p>當然，爲了愛護國片的熱忱，一脂粉市場」的公映是値得我們歡喜的事！</p>
<h3>電影小說秘密（ＳＥＣＲＥＴＳ）（五）</h3>
<p>— 開羅</p>
<p>「你的家中，還有誰家的牛。」傑克說完了，哈哈笑了起來。</p>
<p>「你們眞可惡」，曼麗很堅强不屈的喊着，「我丈夫辛苦了這些時候，到給你們這些毛賊們搶走了，你們這些强盜，殺人的兇犯！」</p>
<p>傑克聽了，眼晴半閉着，霍然從腰中挼出一把尖刀，向前一擲，正挿在離小約翰的頭　許的木床上。曼麗怪呌了一聲，連忙將小約翰抱了起來。傑克說「下次說話，當心些。你還要記得，我的刀是擊無不中的。」這樣他們就走了。</p>
<p>曼麗抱了小孩啼哭着，約翰和沈香回來了。他們在路上已經遇見傑克一夥强盜，但因衆寡懸殊，並且心中惦記着曼麗小孩的安全，所以並没有和他們開火，就輕輕將他們放過去了。約翰回到家裏，同曼麗商量着，要作遷地爲良之計。曼麗還懷疑他是怯弱，肯這樣輕輕地被一夥强盜趕跑了。約翰想告訴她，這些偷牛賊到底是怎樣的一等人，以及不能用武力頑抗的緣因；但是他的目光，正在四面游　的時候，他看見小木牛倒在地下，已被皮靴所踏碎了；　有小約翰的床頭，挿着一把尖銳的小刀。他看見了，怒氣如潮水湧上心頭，再也按擦不住。這些可惡的毛賊，非但盜竊他的牛羣，並且侵入他的家室！是可忍，孰不可忍！他霍的跳了起來，從凳子上拿過他的槍來，背在肩上。他說：「曼麗，你的話對的。我不能這樣輕輕地被一般毛賊趕跑了。這村裏還可以找得出十幾個壯丁，去和他們决一决雌雄。」他將她摟在懷中，低聲的說：「我今晚不見得回來，但是有沈香帮你看家。」他走過去，將傑克的小刀拔了下來，挿在腰帶　，大踏步地跑到門口。</p>
<p>「親愛的約翰，我愛你。」曼麗在他身背後低低地呌着，當他走出大門的當兒，她看着他丈夫的後影，心中無限地痛切與驕矜。後來她就關了門，回到她兒子的身旁。</p>
<p>約翰一去三天，没有回來。在這三天之中，曼麗在家中，覺得愁雲慘　，暗無天日。小約翰病得很重。曼麗不得已，派了沈香到隣村去請了麥高芬醫生來。曼麗和麥高芬輪流着看護小約翰。後來小約翰已得了一綫的生機，曼麗心安了許多，但是醫生警告她：「小約翰的心臟，還很脆弱，不可有些微的驚嚇，亦不可使他聽見什麽高大的聲音。不然的話……」</p>

        <h1>1933.05.11</h1>
<h3>Conversations in Washington and Chinese Letters</h3>
<p>Washington Talks. It began with British Prime Minister MacDonald. After former French Prime Minister Herriot went to the United States to exchange views with Roosevelt, it was decided that eleven countries, including China, Germany, Italy, and Canada, would be invited to the meeting. It was also decided not to adopt the diplomatic form of a roundtable conference, but for representatives from each country to meet with the U.S. President separately. China will be represented by the current Minister of Finance, Song Ziwen, who will cross the ocean to the New World. He has now safely arrived in Washington and has already met with the U.S. President once. According to Reuters, the content of the talks was very brief, but even from these simple words, it is not difficult to infer the general idea: the economic market relationship in the East is the most important, while the invasion of the four northeastern provinces is of secondary importance.</p>
<p>From the American standpoint, especially from the U.S.'s world economic standpoint, to analyze the Far East problem and explore the relationship of the four northeastern provinces being occupied, it seems that the focus should be on the economy. Issues such as currency, silver price stability, and market development are of utmost importance. However, if we take a step back and look at the actual situation in the East and carefully examine the positions of China and the United States, we will know that the so-called economic problems in the Washington talks cannot be separated from political relations and are often constrained by military considerations. Since the invasion of the Northeast, the Chinese economy has suffered enormous losses. Imports have exceeded exports drastically, and the national economy is collapsing, but at the same time, the world economy is also feeling the impact of Japanese imperialism's monopoly, losing the Northeast market. Moreover, due to the unrest in the Northeast, the Yangtze River basin is also suffering greatly. Recently, Rehe fell and Luandong was in turmoil. Japanese warlords are making insatiable demands, and Tianjin and Beijing are under the threat of force. Although this is a problem between our country and Japan, it may be said to have no direct connection with the world economic conference. However, if Japan does not abandon its military aggression, our people will never give up. The Far East market will become increasingly dangerous due to the long-term conflict between China and Japan. The new state of equilibrium in the world economy will not be guaranteed. Therefore, the Far East problem cannot be considered irrelevant to the world economy.</p>
<p>The United States knows this. It also sees the standstill of the disarmament conference and the peace treaty becoming a mere formality. The danger of international influence on the economy is no less than tariff wars and currency devaluation. After careful consideration by Roosevelt, MacDonald, and Herriot, in addition to satisfying France's "security guarantee," the Kellogg-Briand Pact will be re-proposed to promote the success of arms reduction and limit the threat of war. Another agreement treaty will also be proposed. Although this treaty is not specifically aimed at Japan, it cannot be said to be unrelated to Japan. First, if a "supplementary non-war agreement treaty" is established at the World Economic Conference, its strengthened results will be fully applicable to Sino-Japanese disputes. After the denial of war, even if military force is not necessarily used as a backup, economic blockade will be possible to contain Japan after the formation of economic alliances led by various countries. Second, if the agreement treaty is established and France is able to satisfy its "security guarantee," then disarmament can be relatively implemented, and the World Economic Conference can also complete its mission. In other words, the United Kingdom, the United States, and European countries will inevitably improve their current adversarial situation and reach a peaceful understanding. At this time, the United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably turn their attention and concentrate their economic power to engage in the development of the Far East market. Japan will be in a difficult situation of being attacked from both sides.</p>
<p>As for the United States abandoning the gold standard and implementing a policy of currency inflation to stimulate its domestic industry and increase foreign trade exports, our country is a silver-using country and is also the most promising market for U.S.-manufactured products. In the future, as a result of economic competition among countries, silver prices will increase, while commodity prices will fall, causing a general decline in purchasing power and a panic of increased inventory. If the war line along the Great Wall expands, I fear that economic peace will not be attainable, and the world's economic panic will be further deepened.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to striving to fight against Japan, our people deeply hope that the United States will deeply understand the connections between international situations and not be constrained by temporary interests, which will lead to greater disasters in the future. We also hope that our representative, Song Ziwen, will be able to adapt to the changing times and deal with them skillfully.</p>

<p>Fake Urges Russia to Return Detained Cars</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Russian Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Yurenev, visited Vice Minister Arita at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 9th to inquire about the Japanese government's opinion on the establishment of a joint Russian-Japanese-"Manchukuo" committee and the purchase of the CER. Arita replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already expressed its opinion on the issue of the joint committee in a note to Russia on December 13th of last year, that is, preventing all incidents occurring near the border and establishing a permanent mechanism to resolve this issue is the fundamental policy. Specific matters have not yet been determined due to the need to consult with the military. As for the CER purchase issue, it is currently being considered by the relevant authorities. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is most appropriate for Russia and "Manchukuo" to negotiate because the CER has various international relations.

<p>Plot to Occupy Chahar Province</p>
<p>Japan's Ambitions Unfulfilled</p>
<p>Observations by the Russian Newspaper</p>
<p>(Moscow) The newspaper "Pravda" published its observations on the actions of the Japanese army in North China in an editorial today, stating that the Japanese army's withdrawal from the Luanhe area was due to several difficulties: first, a large number of Chinese troops were concentrated in front; second, certain foreign interests existed, and their military actions could cause diplomatic disputes. As a result, the Japanese army changed its plan of advance and turned to the direction of Chahar. The newspaper continued to say that Chahar is an excellent junction and military center. The occupation of Chahar Province would allow the Japanese to drive straight in to take the Tianjin-Beijing area or Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Outer Mongolia. The newspaper concluded by saying that the seriousness of the Japanese attempt is proved by a new fact, that is, the Japanese army in North China has recently increased by one division, and a large number of troops have been mobilized, targeting Zhangjiakou.

<p>Song Ziwen Declares No Mention of This Matter</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Chinese Minister of Finance Song Ziwen met with U.S. President Roosevelt, U.S. Secretary of State Hull, and many economic advisors to discuss the possibility of silver's position in the world currency. The meeting lasted a long time. The U.S. authorities also asked Song to explain the increase in China's purchasing power once the price of silver rises sharply. After hearing Song's presentation, Breed, who had investigated in Europe, reported on the possibility of countries increasing the minting of silver coins. According to Breed's investigation, the use of silver in subsidiary coins may be increased, but whether silver can be widely used as currency is still in doubt. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull met with Chinese Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Song Ziwen this morning. The focus of the talks was on the silver issue, as silver is of great importance to Chinese trade.

The Chinese side included Minister Song, Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji, and two experts. (Havas telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>Tariff Truce</p>
<p>Compromise Reached Between the U.S. and the U.K.</p>
<p>The British House of Commons Begins Foreign Policy Debate</p>
<p>(London) Since the U.S. and the U.K. have reached an agreement on an immediate tariff truce and reiterated the truce during the World Economic Conference, it was officially announced today. The Organizing Committee of the World Economic Conference will meet at the British Foreign Office today (or tomorrow) to pass the truce proposal. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald continued to express his views today in the House of Commons debate on foreign policy, supplementing his brief remarks made upon his return from the U.S. last week. The British Prime Minister said that all parties in Washington unanimously believed that the World Economic Conference might not be completely successful unless the difficulties of war debts were eliminated before the end of the conference. However, no parties have discussed dealing with the war debt issue before the opening of the Economic Conference. The recent discussions between the U.S. and the U.K. indicate that the U.S. and the U.K. have a vision of establishing an agreement on an immediate tariff truce. The British Prime Minister continued to mention the commercial agreement negotiations, saying that the tariff truce would not hinder the U.K. from continuing its current work. The British Prime Minister also said that if the disarmament conference has satisfactory results, the U.S. is prepared to participate in the consultative agreement and participate in the work of stabilizing Europe. The impact of this move will increase the security of Europe and prevent threatened countries from being harmed by war. This is a very big step forward. The British Prime Minister concluded by saying that Washington will issue a declaration at the appropriate time. The U.S. and the U.K. are now determined to do their best to help alleviate the panic among European peaceful nations. (Reuters telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister MacDonald delivered his speech, the House of Commons engaged in debate. Labour Party opposition leader Lansbury reiterated the Labour Party's view that capitalism is incapable of resolving economic panic and that the government has no definite consistent policy on the war debt issue. Liberal Party Member of Parliament and former Home Secretary Muir expressed dissatisfaction, saying that accepting a tariff truce and re-imposing import restrictions are contradictory and should be resolved clearly and actively. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Hall advocated raising wholesale prices of raw materials and finally mentioned bimetallism, saying that the only good strategy to promote international trade and increase China's purchasing power is to raise the price of silver. Foreign Secretary Simon replied to the members of Parliament, insisting on the government's position on the tariff truce issue, saying that a compromise may be reached in the negotiations between the U.S. and the U.K. This morning, the British newspapers commented heavily on MacDonald's speech in the House of Commons tomorrow. General public opinion has gradually become optimistic, but continues to express concern about the revision of war debts and German politics. The newspapers uniformly viewed the U.S. and U.K.'s opinions on disarmament as gratifying. The "Daily Telegraph" declared that this was the main result of MacDonald's trip to Washington.

<p>Revising War Debts</p>
<p>The U.S. is Willing to Open the Door to Negotiations</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated today that if debtor countries request to revise war debts and can regard them as a pure debt issue without involving other matters, then the U.S. is ready to discuss them at any time. However, although Hull acknowledges that war debts have an important impact on the general economic situation, he is unwilling to make them a part of the London World Economic Conference, saying that war debts are an issue between the U.S. and each debtor country and naturally cannot become a topic for discussion at the World Conference. However, the U.S. is willing to discuss revising war debts in London during the conference, but its discussion must be completely separate from the conference and will be negotiated separately with each debtor country. According to Hull, this statement was made in response to British Prime Minister MacDonald's statement that revising war debts is a necessary measure for economic recovery. Hull also stated that he was only explaining the U.S.'s views and was not diminishing the importance of the war debt issue. His final statement was that the U.S. has been prepared to discuss any proposals from debtor countries for months now. Currently, Washington insiders interpret Hull's statement as saying that he must have recently contacted Democratic leaders in Congress and obtained some agreement. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated that the U.S. government is prepared to discuss plans for adjusting war debts proposed by debtor countries, it is heard that many Democratic leaders are preparing to ask the President to secretly report on his conversations with the U.K. Proponents of revising war debts in the Senate, who have always been considered to have little power, have recently told their opponents that European countries may be unable to repay the installments due in June. Such long-term delays will only hinder the progress of international economic recovery. Now that the European countries have not expressed any urgent desire to repay the debt in silver and have not expressed their opinions on the installments due in June, all countries except France and Belgium have shown little enthusiasm for the tariff truce proposal. Therefore, if we refuse to consider revising war debts or deferring debt payments, we will not only fail to increase but will restrict the U.S.'s position in the London Conference. Therefore, even the generally strong opponents have not been unmoved. Therefore, the U.S. Secretary of State's statement today is not only asking members of Congress to study the war debt issue, but also asking debtor countries to submit concrete plans. According to reliable sources, if Democratic members of Congress can express their agreement, Hull will propose to postpone the war debt due in June, in order to open a way to a final solution this summer or during the London Conference. As for the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, who initiated the authorization of debtor countries to repay debts in silver, it has been heard that he has been deeply disappointed recently, especially because he heard that some debtor countries believe that this move is intended to raise the price of silver, rather than a genuine concession. Therefore, it is widely rumored that some silver-supporting members of Congress will vote in favor of postponing the repayment, as long as a portion can be paid in silver when the debt is repaid in the future.

<p>(Paris) Former French Prime Minister Herriot said after returning to France from the U.S. that the results of his negotiations in the U.S. were quite unsatisfactory to the current government. Herriot reported to the Cabinet on Sunday the results of his talks with President Roosevelt in Washington. After accepting the report, the Cabinet thanked Herriot, but according to newspaper reports, the Cabinet did not accept Herriot's articles and recommendations. Among the Cabinet members, in addition to Foreign Minister Pengu and Interior Minister Shawn Deng, who tried their best to defend Herriot, the opinions of the other Cabinet members were the same as those of Daladier. Roosevelt's promises were too broad and subtle to make France change its attitude towards the U.S. Therefore, the Cabinet has decided to postpone the payments due on December 15 of last year and June 15 of this year.

<p>Japanese Establish Cattle Slaughterhouse in Jinan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry reported that the Japanese have established a cattle slaughterhouse in Jinan, buying up draft cattle from Shandong Province and concentrating them in Jinan for slaughter. The daily consumption is several heads. The ban on slaughtering draft cattle should be enforced, and they should be concentrated in Jinan for slaughter. The ignorant villagers are sacrificing their ability to cultivate. The slaughterhouse consumes a dozen or more heads per day, hundreds per month, and four or five thousand per year. If this continues, all the cattle in Shandong Province will be slaughtered by the slaughterhouse. This is a major issue for the rural areas. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit negotiations, the Ministry of Industry will also order the Shandong Department of Construction to strictly prohibit farmers from selling. It was also found that the area with the highest income from slaughter tax in the country is also dominated by the export of slaughtered cattle. (Special Telegram, 10th)</p>

It has been supplied by the United States and Japan. The price of the American product is 400 yuan per ton, and the price of the Japanese product is 130 yuan to 160 yuan per ton. Since we produce it ourselves, the estimated cost is slightly more expensive than the Japanese, but the carbon content is 94%, which is better than the Japanese product. (Special Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>Shanghai Japanese</p>
<p>Telegraph Disconnection Causes Japanese Complaint</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that the submarine cable between Nagasaki and Shanghai has been out of order since 7:00 AM on the 3rd, and has not been repaired for a week. As a result, voices of criticism are growing. Since the 3rd, all telegrams have been handled by the Great Northern Telegraph Company, which uses English codes, causing considerable inconvenience. Confidential business telegrams and news agency telegrams between the mainland and Shanghai have to be inspected by the Chinese authorities, severely impacting communications. Currently, the general Japanese population is extremely resentful that the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau has not dispatched a repair ship.</p>

<p>Record of the Renji Hospital Annual Meeting</p>
<p>The Renji Hospital on Shandong Road held its annual donors' meeting the day before yesterday. Sir Grain, the chief judge, presided over the meeting. Sir Grain is scheduled to resign and return to his country on the 16th of this month, but he still made time to attend the meeting to report on the achievements of last year's work. There were 146,475 outpatient visits, with an average of 400 visits per day. 3,058 surgeries were performed, with an average of eight surgeries per day. However, the hospital's expenses last year were short by 28,928 taels. Although there are various reasons, the decrease in Chinese donations from 15,168 taels in the previous year to 2,323 taels has had a significant impact. It is hoped that Chinese friends of the hospital will continue to pay more attention to the hospital's affairs in the future. Subsequently, the 1932 hospital affairs report and accounting summary were passed, the custodial committee was voted on, and new directors were elected before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Inspection of Rickshaws</p>
<p>Still Held Every Two Months</p>
<p>Condition of Vehicles to be Improved as a Condition</p>
<p>In the Public Concession, rickshaws (i.e., Huang Bao cars) used to be inspected every six months. Since 1925, they have been inspected every two months. Recently, due to the uncleanliness or disrepair of these vehicles, the Public Works Department plans to continue inspections twice in May and June of this year to promote their improvement. However, the Rickshaw Industry Association believes that this measure may affect the livelihood of rickshaw pullers and requested that inspections continue to be held every two months as before. The Public Works Department has now considered this and decided that inspections will be held every two months, with one condition: the condition of the vehicles must be significantly improved within the next two months.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Case of Lin Weiqing Two Years Ago</p>
<p>Key Suspect Chen Baofu Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Baofu Was a Concession Police Officer</p>
<p>Motivated to Kidnap Due to Unpaid Rent to Lin</p>
<p>Lin Weiqing, brother of Lin Biao, president of the Suzhou High Court, was an architect residing at 55 Baikai'er Road. On the evening of February 8, 1931, Lin, accompanied by his wife and sister, returned home in his car, license number 3733. Upon arriving at the entrance, they were suddenly confronted by several kidnappers who brandished pistols and threatened to kidnap them. Seeing the situation was bad, Lin resisted and engaged in a struggle with the kidnappers. As a result, Lin and his sister escaped, but his wife was unable to escape and was held in the car under the kidnappers' watch. They sped away, and when they arrived at the intersection of Minhang Road and Broadway Road in Hongkou, the car suddenly stopped due to a mechanical issue. Seeing an opportunity, Lin's wife lied to the kidnappers, claiming that the car had run out of gasoline. The kidnappers panicked and believing her, fled the scene. Afterwards, Lin's wife reported the incident to the Huishan police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Lin's bodyguard, Wang Jiakui, was suspected to be involved in the case. Under normal circumstances, when Lin returned home by car, he would honk the horn, and Wang would open the door upon hearing the sound. However, on that day, Wang did not immediately open the door, and when he finally did, he immediately closed it after seeing the kidnappers, preventing Lin's wife from escaping. The police arrested Wang Jiakui, who confessed to having conspired with a man named Chen Baofu to kidnap Lin Weiqing. Chen Baofu was the main instigator and operated the Longquan Tea House on Qiwupu Road. The detectives took Wang to arrest Chen, but Chen had already fled. Only a photo of Chen was found. Wang was sent to the First Special District Court, which sentenced him to death in the first instance. However, the provincial government sent the case back for retrial, and Wang's sentence was reduced to 12 years in prison. Chen Baofu remained at large for two years. Until recently, detectives from the Jing'an Temple police station arrested Chen and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the trial in the eighth criminal court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts, saying that Chen was being prosecuted under Article 1, Paragraph [blank] of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. The defendant had confessed to the police that the house of the Longquan Tea House he ran belonged to Lin Weiqing, and because he was in arrears with the rent for several months, Lin wanted to sue him. Chen then colluded with Lin's bodyguard Wang Jiakui and the fugitive Wang Yaoxi to carry out the kidnapping. A written confession was presented for review, and it was requested that a thorough investigation be conducted. The defendant Chen Baofu testified that he had been a doorman at the Public Works Department for many years and was acquainted with Wang Jiakui. He had an argument with Wang over rent collection, which led to a fight. However, he had no prior knowledge of the kidnapping case and was falsely accused by Wang. Wang Jiakui was also brought from the Western Prison for questioning by Judge Wu. His answers were evasive and he was unwilling to speak clearly. The court ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered Chen Baofu to be returned to custody for further questioning.</p>
<p>Various Clubs</p>
<p>Small Champagne Ticket Results Announced</p>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club Members' Club, the most famous champagne ticket of the Shanghai Race Club Members' Club in this city, had its lottery numbers announced the other night. Since the Grand Champagne Race has been held on schedule, the first, second, and third prizes for the champagne ticket have also been produced as above. It is reported that the club has entrusted the Great China Electric Company in this city to broadcast various news at any time, which is very popular with listeners. Those who want detailed number lists can get them from the club at Luhuatang, Mahuo Road.</p>
<p>Banking Club The Banking Club of this city issued 25,000 champagne tickets for members for the Shanghai Racecourse Spring Competition, with four numbers connected on each ticket, sold for five yuan. Today (the 10th) at 2:00 PM, the lottery was drawn in public at the conference hall of the Hong Kong Road Banking Association. In addition to the directors of the club attending, Bei Zuyi, Accountant Ye Yuan, and Lawyer Cai Rudong were invited to the venue to notarize. Many people came to watch the lottery. First, President Yang Jemei gave a speech reporting the number of tickets sold and the lottery method, and then the lottery was drawn. Unfortunately, the champagne tickets were not all sold out, so the first prize could not reach the original amount of 50,000 yuan. However, with fewer tickets and more opportunities, the ticket buyers also have their benefits.</p>
<p>China Soap Company Club The Spring Member Champagne of the China Soap Company Club totaled 5,000 tickets. Because the ticket amount was small and it was easier to win prizes, members enthusiastically purchased them and they were all sold out. On May 9th at 7:00 PM, the club prepared refreshments and invited guests to supervise the lottery.</p>
<p>A Comedy</p>
<p>Married for Eight Days, Sleeping Separately</p>
<p>Groom Suspicious, Bride Wrongfully Accused</p>
<p>Coroner's Examination Reveals the Truth</p>
<p>Wang A'da, a 23-year-old farmer from Wangjiapaolou, twelve miles north of Wusong, married Miss Chen (17 years old), the daughter of Mrs. Chen Yang, a rural woman from Wusong Town, on April 13th of this year. However, after the marriage, both the bride and groom were young and unsophisticated, and they were often shy, so they did not talk for several days. At night, they slept on the same bed but had different dreams, with quilts separating them, and no intimate relations occurred. After eight days, the bride returned to her mother's home in Ningbo. She was going to stay at her mother's, but then the red tide [menstruation] came, and she was superstitious so she stayed at her mother's. However, Wang A'da felt neglected because his bride had been cold to him for eight days after the marriage, and now she had gone home and not returned. Moreover, his mother-in-law had remarried Wang Beiyao, who ran a pancake shop. In the past, the mother and daughter had lived in the same room as the stepfather, and he suspected that his wife had an affair with her stepfather. Therefore, suspicions arose, and he rushed to his wife's home the day before yesterday. He saw that his wife's family only had one room, and he concluded that his stepfather-in-law was having an affair with his wife. He reported to the First Branch of the Seventh District, and Wang Zhaoyao, Chen Yang, and Wang Chen were arrested and sent to the local court for questioning yesterday. When Prosecutor Xie Lian opened the court for questioning, Wang A'da claimed that after his wife married him, he slept inside the quilt and she slept on top of the quilt, and she did not call him. Now that she has returned to Ningbo, she has not returned. When he went to call her, she was sleeping with her stepfather. Wang Chen claimed, "I am a bride. Only the groom calls the bride. There is no reason for a bride to be ashamed. As for the false accusation that I am having an affair with my stepfather, I ask for an examination. But I will not give up if my reputation is damaged." Wang Zhaoyao testified, "I am 40 years old, and I am also a child from a family of poetry and rites. My father was once a magistrate in Guangdong. I am poor now, but I do not do shameless things. If my reputation is damaged, I ask for retaliation." Chen Yang testified, "Although I have remarried, I have always supervised my daughter well. An examination can be conducted." After much debate between the two sides, the judge ordered a medical examination and found that the bride was a virgin. As a result, the truth was revealed, and the bride's side was outraged, demanding compensation for her reputation. The judge repeatedly persuaded them for a long time and ordered the two sides to go outside to negotiate a settlement.</p>

<p>Barbering and Other Industries</p>
<p>Please Negotiate the Gao Case</p>
<p>Decision to Request Negotiation According to Law to Value Life</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the murder of barber Gao Yatouzi by French police officer No. 39, Milihong, on Albert Road, Nanchianjiatang in the French Concession, barbering colleagues throughout the city, and fellow Yangzhou natives in Shanghai, have been deeply angered by the French police officer's disregard for Chinese lives. Yesterday morning and afternoon, barbering colleagues and the Yangzhou Fellow Countrymen's Association convened special member meetings to discuss negotiation methods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>All-Barbering Colleague Assembly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Barbering Guild, Pushan Hall, after receiving a report that Gao Yatouzi, an apprentice at the Hushunyuan Barber Shop, was innocently kicked to death by French police officer No. 39, Milihong, of the Shanzhong Road police station in the French Concession, on the morning of May 7th, barbers throughout the city were deeply indignant and demanded that a city-wide barbering colleague assembly be convened to discuss countermeasures. The guild convened a special member meeting around 10:00 AM yesterday, attended by over 300 barbering colleagues from the north and south cities and the British and French concessions. Zhou Lianze, a representative from the city party headquarters, attended to provide guidance. Chen Sijiang, Su Guangdian, and Zhang Yujin were publicly elected as the presidium. After performing the ritual, they silently mourned the deceased for three minutes. (1) Chairman Chen Sijiang reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the details of Gao Yatouzi's death have been seen in previous reports, but the French coroner's examination claimed that there were no injuries and that the death was due to illness. During the coroner's examination, only the upper body of the corpse was examined, and the injured part of the lower body was not examined. If it was said that he was ill, a 15-year-old child could still carry burdens and do business, so there are doubts about the court's coroner's examination. However, there are many witnesses who witnessed Gao Yatouzi being driven to death at the time, and it will not be difficult to prove it in detail in the future. But today's meeting is very enthusiastic, which shows that when there is injustice, people speak out, and everyone has the same heart. This matter concerns international lives, so how should we deal with it? Please discuss it. (2) Zhou Lianze, a representative from the city party headquarters, gave a speech saying that today, he represents the city party headquarters and attends, not because of his relationship with the colleagues, but because the tragic case of Gao Yatouzi concerns law, diplomacy, and lives. In his opinion, your guild should be reorganized into a colleague association according to law, so that you can get legal protection. However, the reorganization procedures cannot be completed in a short time. Now, regarding the tragic case, it is especially urgent to handle it. On the one hand, please ask Lawyer Wu Kaisheng to proceed according to law, and on the other hand, submit a request to various agencies to negotiate with the French authorities, so as to achieve the desired goal. (3) Gao Yuanlin, the father of the deceased, and Guo Wanhai, the representative of the shop owner, Hushunyuan, successively reported on the incident and the situation of the corpse's family. (4) Representatives from all walks of life expressed their opinions, generally paying attention to the goals and negotiation policies. (5) Resolution to demand goals: (A) Punish the murderer severely and execute him on the spot. (B) Provide generous compensation to the family of the deceased and maintain the aftermath. (C) Compensate for the loss of life to value personality. (D) Express an apology to our officials and people. (E) Guarantee that it will not happen again in the future (must be done in writing). (F) Improve policing and maintain public safety. (G) Add senior Chinese officials to the police station. (H) Use more Chinese police and fewer Western police. (I) Chinese directors and commissioners must have real power. (J) Request a review to clarify the truth. The above methods were all passed. (6) Discussion of the policy of coping with negotiations: (A) Submit requests to the competent authorities to negotiate with the French authorities. (B) Send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession to assist in the negotiations. (C) When necessary, elect representatives to make a large petition to various agencies and groups. (D) Hire Lawyer Wu Kaisheng as a legal advisor to handle the case according to law on behalf of the family. (E) Organize a support association for the tragic case to handle all procedures.

<p>British American Tobacco Company Reduces Work Hours</p>
<p>Workers Cross the River to Petition</p>
<p>Minor Conflict Occurs During the Rush</p>
<p>The Union Is Trying to Resolve the Issue</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the current situation, the British American Tobacco Company has experienced sluggish sales of all its products and a gradual increase in inventory. Therefore, the board of directors has decided to gradually reduce work hours at the First Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, the Second Factory in Lujiazhai, and the Third Factory in Hudong. The work hours have been reduced from six days a week to five days, and then to four days since last month. There are tens of thousands of male and female workers in the three factories. Initially, it was assumed that the reduction in work hours was entirely due to the company's poor business performance, and that the reduction of one or two days per week was unavoidable and would not significantly affect livelihoods, so it was not appropriate to oppose it immediately. However, starting this week, the company has announced to the workers of the three factories that they will continue to reduce work hours by one day, and in reality, they will only work three days a week and rest four days. The average monthly salary has been reduced by half. At a time when prices are high, it is really difficult to maintain a living. It is even more difficult for those who have a family of several people relying on one person to work to barely make a living. As a result, it has aroused strong opposition from the workers. Yesterday, the Third Factory took the lead in launching the protest, gathering hundreds of people, and crossing the river to Pudong by boat, rushing into the First and Second Factories, instructing the workers not to accept the factory's announcement of halving work hours. When rushing in, the guards at the door tried to stop them because of the large number of people, causing a minor conflict, but it quickly calmed down, so the order was still good. It is now reported that the workers believe that the factory's continued reduction in work hours will really make it difficult to maintain their livelihoods, so they are demanding that the union negotiate with the company. After receiving the report, the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union believed that the factory had previously guaranteed at least 35 hours of work per week, but now suddenly continued to reduce work hours, which was really wrong. In addition to immediately sending a letter to the factory to lodge a serious protest, it also convened an emergency joint meeting of the executive supervisors at 6:00 PM that night to discuss countermeasures. At the same time, the workers of the Huxi Taopeng Road branch also responded yesterday and announced a strike, expressing the same opposition as the Pudong branches.</p>
<p>Assassination of Feng Deqian</p>
<p>Li Minghui Testified in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Nengxiang Still Asks the Court to Investigate the Evidence</p>
<p>Li Minghui Failed to Identify the Face of the Murderer</p>
<p>Movie star Li Minghui fell in love with wealthy businessman Zheng Guoyou in Hong Kong last spring, but then abandoned Zheng and fell in love with Feng Deqian. Zheng became jealous, wanting to put Feng to death for taking his beloved. He instructed his chauffeur Liu Xing to find a way to kill Feng for 2,000 Hong Kong dollars to vent his anger. Liu then entrusted Xu Yongchen and Wang Nengxiang with the task. On March 24th at 8:30 PM, when Feng and Li were walking hand in hand on the Star Ferry Pier (road name), they used a pistol to kill Feng. Wang Nengxiang fled to Shanghai after the incident. Lu Liankui, the chief Chinese detective of the Public Concession Police, arrested Wang and sent him to the First Special District Court. Wang was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. Wang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The case has been heard once, but because the subpoenaed witness Li Minghui did not arrive, and it was also necessary to investigate in Guangzhou, the hearing was postponed. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued hearing. The Western detective in charge of the case accompanied witness Li Minghui to the First Criminal Court of the Second Branch of the High Court at 1:50 PM. At 2:00 PM, Yu Hua, the head of the Criminal Court of the Second Branch of the High Court, Zhao and Jiang, the two judges, and Prosecutor Zhong took their seats. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian and Wang Nengxiang's lawyer Zhao Chuanding were also present in court. Judge Yu first announced that the appellant requested that evidence be investigated at the Dadong Gramophone Company on Taiping North Road in Guangzhou. The court had entrusted the Guangzhou Local Court to conduct the investigation. Now, according to the reply, there is no Dadong Gramophone Company, so it is impossible to investigate. Wang Nengxiang then claimed that the main store of the Dadong Company is located at 52-54 Wangjiao Road in Hong Kong, and a branch was opened in Guangzhou on Taiping North Road in 1919, located on the east side of the Taiping Theater, which can be investigated. The court then summoned Li Minghui to the court. According to her testimony, on the night in question, when she and Feng Delian were walking hand in hand, she saw a man following behind them, only four or five steps away. She told Feng, but Feng did not pay attention. About two minutes later, she heard a loud sound, and Feng said that he had been hit. But because it was dark at the time, she could</p>

<p>Fudan Retains Jiangnan University Volleyball Championship</p>
<p>Fought Hard Against Daxia in Five Sets, Winning Three to Two</p>
<p>Daxia Collapses in the Final Set</p>
<p>丨Jinan Defeats Daxia to Win Women's Championship丨</p>
<p>Fudan defeated Daxia University in a match of five sets, with a score of three to two. Fudan and Daxia are the strongest teams in Jiangnan, each with a perfect record of five wins and five losses. The final battle was unusually even and intense, with no clear advantage. Daxia collapsed in the final set, and Fudan won the match. The cheering from both sides was very loud. The other match was also quite impressive, with Chih Chih winning three to two against Jinling, and Jiaotong winning three to one against Jinan. The women's championship belonged to Jinan, which defeated Daxia by two to zero yesterday. The scores and match situations are as follows:</p>
<p>(Fudan 21 to 19, 20 to 22, 21 to 13, 20 to 22, 21 to 1 Daxia (Men's))</p>
<p>(Jinan 21 to 14, 21 to 14) Daxia (Women's)</p>
<p>Each Has Its Merits</p>
<p>The strength and skill of Fudan and Daxia in volleyball are truly indistinguishable. It is a true case of equal skill and strength. The one who is more stable in the end wins. However, Fudan's back-row saves are quite good. Daxia's Chen Baoqiu and Wei Dingyi's heavy kills were saved by the back-row players. Fudan's killers, Cheng Mingjue and Xie Baochang's spikes, were particularly effective.</p>

<p>Difficult to Distinguish</p>
<p>Fudan won the first set, Daxia took back the second, Fudan won the third set, and Daxia won the fourth set, making it a tense situation that could not be resolved. In these four sets, there were several bitter battles before the winner was decided. In the first set, when Daxia was leading with 19 to 17, Fudan chased 14 points to win the first set. The situation was similar in the second set. Fudan had the advantage in the third set, and Daxia fought bravely to win back the fourth set, making it an even situation of two to two.</p>
<p>Complete Collapse</p>
<p>After being one to two down, Daxia worked hard in the fourth set, with success or failure hanging in the balance, and won the fourth set. After this fierce battle, they passed safely through the storm. In the fifth set, they suddenly showed an inability to stabilize and were so flustered that they could not recover. Fudan's attacks were completely unopposed. Daxia only scored one point. Fudan ended the set with two players serving, and the world was suddenly decided, which was unexpected.</p>

<p>Women's Final</p>
<p>The scores of the two sets are the same, 21 to 14. Jinan completely dominated the game.

<h3>Introductory Remarks: The True Meaning of Fashion</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>When clothing is called "fashion," most people automatically think of it as being trendy or modern. But what does "modern" really mean? What are the standards for being modern? What does "trendy" mean, and what are its boundaries? Try asking someone if they can answer these questions. Without standards or boundaries, it's not worthy of being called "fashion." In my opinion, the meaning of "fashion" has three aspects:</p>
<p>First, it's about aesthetics. Loving beauty is human nature. Not just adults, but even small children like to wear beautiful clothes. Look at a child in the family. If you put a nice new outfit on them today, they'll be excited and proud, with an indescribable expression. Generally, the standards for beauty are: first, elegance; second, cleanliness; and third, simplicity. What is most taboo is vulgarity, rudeness, or strangeness.</p>
<p>Second, the true meaning of fashion is suitability. Mr. Hu Shi said, "There's no such thing as fashionable or unfashionable, only suitable or unsuitable. What is suitable is fashionable, and what is unsuitable is unfashionable." For example, in today's busy world, agility is valued. If we were to still wear the wide robes and large sleeves of centuries past, it would not only be unsuitable but would also make us a laughingstock. Therefore, suitable clothing should have the following three standards: first, convenience; second, economy; and third, simplicity. What is most taboo is being cumbersome, extravagant, or complicated.</p>
<p>Third, the essence of fashionable clothing is hygiene. Fashion must be hygienic. Narrow sleeves hinder movement, and constricted chests impede development. Furthermore, heavy fur and thick cotton easily lead to a decreased ability to withstand the cold. None of these can be considered fashionable. Hygienic fashion should first be in accordance with the seasons, second be in line with science, and third be moderate. What is most taboo is disregarding the climate, going against science, or being excessive or insufficient.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the China National Goods Company holding a national goods fashion convention, this publication has created this special issue on fashion to encourage the Chinese people to pay attention to fashion and to correct the common misunderstanding of the true meaning of fashion. Therefore, we present these three main points as a contribution to those in society who are interested in Chinese-made fashion.</p>
<h3>Old Women's National Goods Fashion</h3>
<p>— Rui Shousong</p>
<p>If we go to the streets or crowded markets, especially during grand temple festivals, we can easily see that most "old and decrepit" old women who walk with a sway wear national goods—shirts made of Shilin silk and trousers made of white homespun cloth. On their feet are pointed shoes made of black twill or black satin. Some old women even embroider beautiful wildflowers or even the characters "Longevity and Wealth," and "Blessings and Longevity." Some old women also wear osmanthus flowers and wild roses in their hair. To fashionable people, this decoration must be scorned as "outdated" and "pedantic," but in the minds of the old women, it is indeed the epitome of fashion!</p>
<p>It's not that they don't have money to use "foreign devils' national goods," but they can't manage them. It's not that they don't have the ability to "loudly advocate for national goods," but they feel that loudly advocating is embarrassing and not very effective. Only by burying themselves in the work can they be effective!</p>
<p>Furthermore, they admit that their prime has passed. In the course of their lives, they have shed countless drops of sweat and used countless amounts of energy. Now that they are old, they can finally enjoy a peaceful life. Therefore, wearing that kind of national goods fashion is both a way to express "enjoying their twilight years" and a way to commemorate the hard work and sweat they have shed in the past!</p>
<h3>Baby's Cries</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>It was a rainy morning, probably around the Qingming Festival? Gusts of northeast wind still brought some chill. The eldest daughter of the second landlord was preparing her schoolbag as usual, getting ready to go to school. Perhaps it was her mother's love that made her want her to wear more clothes. "Mom! Don't need to wear more! It looks ugly; with this scarf, I don't feel cold." I heard the eldest daughter say this, and it caught my attention. I thought, could the warmth of a scarf warm the whole body? Because time was tight, I couldn't bother with idle chatter and left with my umbrella.</p>
<p>As someone who sits at a desk all day, I didn't get home to rest until after 5:00 PM. As soon as I stepped into the doorway, Wang's six-year-old daughter! Baby, was crying like a slaughtered pig. I always hate being bothered, so I walked over to take a look. I saw Baby desperately pulling at the eldest daughter's scarf. Mrs. Wang, however, scolded angrily: "It will fade soon enough. What is it good for! When you grow up, I will ask your father to spend five dollars to buy you a foreign one."</p>
<p>At this time, I became impatient and said, "Mrs. Wang, why don't you make her one! Anyway, it's easy to do with two or three dimes. Although this lined flannel isn't as good as foreign serge, it's still beautiful and doesn't fade. Many families, big and small, buy it to make qipaos and scarves! As for the five-dollar foreign scarves, I advise you not to buy them! If there are good national goods to replace them, why buy foreign goods, especially when the Japanese are invading!" Mrs. Wang was, of course, not satisfied with my philosophical speech, but she couldn't resist Baby's crying, so she took advantage of the free time, dragged the eldest daughter, and went out to buy cloth.</p>
<p>Before 9:00 PM that night, Wang's Baby ran happily to my side. Sure enough, her mother's hands were fast, and Baby already had a black and white checkered scarf made of national goods lined flannel around her neck. Indeed, she was very proud and innocently showed it to me. I asked, "Baby! This scarf is made of Chinese goods, do you like it?" She said, "Yes, I heard my big sister say: Using national goods is patriotic!" Strange! A six-year-old girl also understands "national goods" and "patriotism." It can be seen that the psychology of most of our compatriots regarding the purchase and use of national goods has not been completely extinguished, but I have always been skeptical about Mrs. Wang's words.</p>
<h3>National Goods Fashion Illustrated</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>The cheongsam in this illustration is made of light green thin silk, a national product. The collar is cut into a square shape. The neckline, sleeve edges, and hem are all edged with dark green thin silk with the same pattern. This results in a novel, beautiful, and generous fashion. I hope ladies will try to make it.</p>
<h3>A Lover's Gift</h3>
<p>— Liu Zengwei</p>
<p>Zhang Yimin came out of his house excitedly, holding a large clothes box in his hand. The box had the words "XX National Goods Company" printed on it.</p>
<p>"She will definitely like it," he thought to himself, a smile constantly appearing on his face.</p>
<p>"Yimin, you should use national goods. Some national goods are also very good. Even if the goods are not so good, it is still happy for your conscience to use them." This was Xiuying—Yimin's lover's words, which he remembered again.</p>
<p>"Definitely, she will definitely like it," Yimin thought to himself again. After a while, he stopped in front of a house, raised one hand to the doorbell, and at the same time looked down at the thing in his other hand.</p>
<p>The door opened, and he quickly walked in.</p>
<p>"You're here. What did you bring?" A beautiful girl came out from inside. Seeing the box in his hand, she said this.</p>
<p>"Xiuying, guess," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Could it be your overcoat?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Is it your suit?"</p>
<p>"No, I listened to you and stopped wearing suits a long time ago."</p>
<p>"Then what is it?"</p>
<p>"It's for you."</p>
<p>"For me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, for you."</p>
<p>"Is it something imported again?"</p>
<p>"No, no. I know you don't like imported goods. How could I buy you imported goods again?" He said, and very proudly opened the box and took out a newly made garment.</p>
<p>"I bought you a new outfit." He took the garment and showed it to her, saying this.</p>
<p>"A new outfit that isn't imported?"</p>
<p>"No, I had this new outfit made from national goods at the China National Goods Company."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Who's lying to you? If you don't believe me, look at the box that held the garment."</p>
<p>Xiuying indeed carefully examined the box. It had the words "China National Goods Company" printed on it, which made her believe that the new outfit was Chinese goods. She was extremely happy.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Day After the Fashion Show</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>One winter, Shanghai held a grand Chrysanthemum Show. A fashion show was one of the important programs of the Chrysanthemum Show. Needless to say, the participants in the fashion show were of course the fashionable girls, and this time most of them were top students from the prestigious XX Girls' School.</p>
<p>The day after the fashion show, Mrs. Lin, the principal of XX Girls' School, suddenly summoned the dozen or so students who participated in the performance to her office.</p>
<p>"Ladies, you've worked hard. You've worked hard on another great work of national subjugation!" Principal Lin said with a bitter smile, saying something that seemed very comical.</p>
<p>The dozen or so girls were all stunned, vaguely pondering the novel term, "work of national subjugation."</p>
<p>"Weren't you all in the limelight yesterday? Liu Qianhong wore Parisian satin, Wang Feiyun wore some kind of American glitter yarn, Tao Jingfen wore Qiaoqi velvet, so beautiful, so extravagant. It's a pity you don't have high noses, green eyes, and golden red hair. Otherwise, you would have truly become Western beauties!"</p>
<p>Principal Lin's sharp teasing immediately made her top students realize their sins, and the dozen or so faces turned as red as if they had been painted with rouge.</p>
<p>"To be honest, you have misunderstood the term 'fashion'! Whether clothing is fashionable or not depends entirely on the change of style, not on the change of fabric. We Chinese produce quite a few silks and satins. The colors and patterns are not necessarily much worse than foreign goods. They can be used as fashionable fabrics. Although you are women, don't you know that using national goods is everyone's responsibility?" Speaking of this, Mrs. Lin's withered palms kept hitting the table. "Wake up! Stop being superstitious about Western goods. After the country is subjugated, you may think of your own sins!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lin's words awakened the confused minds of these dozen or so beautiful girls. Everyone felt that "old lady" Lin's (the nickname of the principal) lesson today was truly a force that could not be disobeyed, and they all bowed and retreated willingly.</p>
<p>However, whether they can all use national goods depends on whether the environment can promote them!</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>"I'll go try it on." She took the garment from Yimin's hand and ran inside.</p>
<p>After a while, she came out wearing the new outfit.</p>
<p>"How is it?" she said to Yimin with a smile.</p>
<p>"Very good! Very good!" Yimin said with a smile. "Didn't I tell you that national goods can also make very good new outfits? Do you believe it now?" Xiuying said to Yimin again.</p>
<p>"I believed it a long time ago, so I bought you this new outfit made of national goods," Yimin replied.</p>
<p>"Let's go inside and talk," Xiuying said, and went inside with Yimin.</p>
<h3>Ramblings on Fashion</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>(Dedicated to women of the youth age)</p>
<p>The God of Era tells us: "The era progresses ceaselessly. If it stops, it will be the end of the world!" Then how should people of the youth age follow the era to be a new person in front of the era, instead of being a backward person behind the era?</p>
<p>Youth is valuable, which everyone admits. I think researching on clothing is also a great skill to keep youth. Then let's talk about the modernization of clothing.</p>
<p>In general, women of the youth age understand their time, and they are also very adept at meticulously crafting and manufacturing clothes; however, there is a shortcoming, which is that they specialize in using foreign fabrics, willing to be a promoter of foreign goods. Regarding this point, I would like to give advice to women of the youth age with my greatest respect. In the future, when you are making new clothes, it is better to choose national goods for the fabrics; because the current national silks and crepe have already surpassed the beauty of foreign goods, and they are unfolding a beautiful and bright appearance, waiting for you.</p>
<p>The time has shifted to summer, and of course the clothing also changes in style with the time. Let me introduce some fashions! It has become the current trend for women to like to wear long clothes, and shorts and long trousers have become equal opponents. I think that for the sake of preserving the dignity of women, shorts are very inappropriate under long clothes. If you wear shorts to stroll in the park, and you sit down on a park bench, the shorts will inevitably be pulled up, which seems very indecent. You may not feel it, but in the eyes of others, it looks like you are not wearing any trousers. My point is to lengthen the legs of the trousers. The diameter of the leg opening should not be more than seven inches. The length should be the same as the long clothes outside. The fabric should be the same color inside and out. It would be best to match the edges of the clothes and the legs of the trousers with symmetrical lace, which will add a lot of beauty.</p>
<p>Printed Georgette is a good fabric to embellish women. In summer, it is best to use a light green background with dark green flowers to make clothes. The shoulders should be made into a drooping cape, and the collar is not needed, but should be a bare-shoulder style. The waist should be thin, and the bottom should be made of pure black pleats, reaching the ankles. The high heels on the feet are best to be light green inlaid with dark green flowers.</p>
<p>A long dress made of pure black Georgette is very suitable for tall and fair women. There is no need to inlay or hem it. The cuffs should be attached to the arm bend with elastic bands. The part where the bands are attached should be enlarged, so that it can have a fluttering style in the evening breeze! The slits on both sides should be opened high, and the inside should be pleated. In this way, even if you run with large steps, you can't see the legs, and it doesn't hinder running and jumping. It is appropriate to wear black leather running shoes on your feet.</p>
<p>Using bright red fabrics in summer seems too fiery, but using them on girls around fifteen or sixteen years old can also reveal their true beauty. If you make a short-sleeved suit top with a bare neckline and chest, I think it would be absolutely wonderful!</p>
<p>Plaid double crepe is very suitable for women of the youth age. The making and color selection are all up to you. If you can use your brain, I can say, "You will definitely create a new atmosphere in the fashion of the sea!"</p>
<h3>Fashion and Beautification</h3>
<p>— Shi Dian</p>
<p>"Fashion" that fits the "times" is, in theory, naturally "perfect" and consistent with the principles of beautification. In reality, however, it's not entirely the case. Many so-called fashions are not necessarily beautifying, and some even fundamentally violate the principles of beautification.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: the general public is often blind. Women are no exception. When they see the novel clothing of so-called "fashionable people," they assume it must be the most beautifying fashion. Vanity often drives them to immediately imitate it. However, they are ignorant of whether it actually aligns with beautification and lack rational restraint.</p>
<p>True fashion, without a doubt, must conform to the principles of beautification and be designed and completed using scientific methods. We don't necessarily need silk fabrics or other expensive materials because they are not necessarily beautifying. Wearing them simply reveals a golden stench. Elegant and simple fabrics, combined with exquisite tailoring, draped on a slender, beautiful woman, with a graceful and ethereal quality, that is the democratic, fashionable, and artistic fashion!</p>
<h3>National Goods Fashion Amidst National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hu Louzhen</p>
<p>The national crisis is becoming more pressing every day, and everyone should take responsibility for saving the country. This is absolutely undeniable. However, saving the country and loving the country cannot be achieved by empty words and grandstanding. The most important thing is to start with each of us!</p>
<p>The spring is bright, and its richness has reached its highest degree; in reality, it is already the "beginning of summer," so the weather has gradually moved from mild to warm and hot. At this moment, what exactly do we choose to make our national goods fashion? Here, we offer and introduce our summer fashion, roughly, for discussion with our female compatriots:</p>
<p>As we have said before, saving the country and loving the country should start with each individual. As this summer season begins, I think it is best to use "Freedom Cloth" or "Humiliation Cloth" for our national goods fabrics ("This is my subjective standard"), because these two are authentic national goods, their form is both beautiful and elegant, and their material is firm and solid. Based on my little experience in recent years, I think I am very satisfied. Regarding everything about it, I think it is by no means achievable with foreign goods!</p>
<p>At this time, when it is neither cold nor hot and the seasons are changing, wearing silk and satin may not be the right time, so Humiliation Cloth and Freedom Cloth still seem to be in their "prime." Its appreciation by people can last at least forty days. This can be said with certainty!</p>
<h3>Fashion of Rural Women</h3>
<p>— Guanshan</p>
<p>The sky is a dark blue, floating with some white clouds that drift along lightly. A breeze mixed with the fragrance of flowers blows on your face, and the sounds of birds fill the universe. Ah, what a spring evening, it is a time for a walk in the distance! If you have ever walked or strolled in the countryside, you will see that women over the age of thirty wear short shirts made of blue cloth, trousers made of white rough cloth, and on their heads are inferior scarves, with blue checks. Their feet are covered with shoes made of black twill, sitting there quietly doing their sewing. Women under the age of thirty wear red cloth pants, short shirts with striped cloth or cloth with flower heads, and most of their feet are bare, without a headscarf, but with a few yellow and white wildflowers inserted, happily and innocently handling their trivial housework, or playing with their children.</p>
<p>True patriots are rural women. They don't pay attention to beauty, they are very frugal. Red flowers and checks are considered the most beautiful to them. They don't need any silk or satin, but they can very naturally and mysteriously show their most beautiful fashion. They use national goods purely, but unlike urban women who shout about national goods but wear Indian silk on their bodies, I think urban women should take them as an example and follow their innocent and frugal fashion.</p>
<h3>Fashion and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>The spring god has left, and the god of summer is gradually approaching, and the earth shows a harmonious and vigorous spirit.</p>
<p>Clumsy and heavy clothes, "time" will tell it, that it has fallen into disuse.</p>
<p>People must at this time remove the outdated clothes and put on light and floaty single-layer clothes.</p>
<p>At this moment, young girls will spare no money to choose the slender and moving fashion.</p>
<p>To make fashion is an important plan to adapt to the natural environment. Before you do it, don't forget one thing, that is, try to choose domestic materials as much as possible.</p>
<p>The motherland is already so fragile, and the compatriots of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe are already doing the real thing of being slaves to the country. We rely on heaven and earth (?) to still be able to breathe the air of freedom here, and we still have the opportunity to enjoy that "fashion", and we and the slaves of the country from the three northeastern provinces and Rehe are really as far apart as heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Living in the real paradise, we should quickly use domestic goods, otherwise, we are afraid that we will not suffer the same fate as these slaves of the country!</p>
<p>Moreover, good compatriots! Don't underestimate domestic goods. There are many beautiful and durable domestic goods, the prices are cheap, and they can save the country. When worn on the slender body of a girl, they show extra charm and gracefulness!</p>
<p>Young ladies! Why don't you pay attention to it!</p>
<h3>My Family's National Goods Clothing</h3>
<p>— Manbin</p>
<p>My family's national goods clothing is very interesting to talk about, so I might as well talk about it:</p>
<p>First, my husband's clothing has always been frugal, but the first thing he pays attention to is the quality of the material, so it is very difficult for me, who is his procurement officer. Sometimes, I casually buy some, but he doesn't trust them, and often doesn't allow them to be tailored. Once, after it was made, because he was afraid that it was not real national goods, he still didn't wear it. So later, I always went to his familiar manufacturers that he designated to buy the cloth, such as Sanyou and Hongxin, the silk and satin, such as Meiya, and the woolen fabrics, such as Zhanghua, so that he could rest assured. Second is the problem of tailoring. He is very particular about the times, but his times are just suitable, not long, not short, not wide, not narrow, so-called moderate. Once, he suddenly happily wore a student uniform made of national cloth and asked him why he learned the times. He said that it didn's matter what the times were, but it was just convenient.</p>
<p>Second, my own clothing also uses national goods as the only material, but I pay attention to the color and durability. The color should be elegant and never fade. Like our family, the budgeted clothing expenses total sixteen yuan per month, and it is not good to often add to them, so durability is the most important issue. I make my own clothes, so I don't care whether they are in fashion or not, but only whether they are comfortable or not.</p>
<p>Third, my youngest daughter, Quan'er, after participating in the clothing improvement meeting of the Family Renewing Society last time, developed the habit of loving to wear national goods clothing. What 212 or Snowflake tweed, are all the fabrics she loves to use. Recently, Mr. Xu Yangnan sent a newly-released cloth sample from Hongxin. Hongxin's colors contain three elements: elegance, simplicity, and tranquility. She was the first to try it. After trying it on, her colleagues at the bank all imitated her, and her classmates at Shanghai University of Commerce all imitated him. Later, Awei, Atong, A-Yuan, etc., all wanted to wear cloth clothes. Atong and A-Yuan especially love the serious attire of short clothes. When they wear short clothes and then put on leather shoes, they feel majestic and high-spirited. Also, I don't approve of children going shirtless, so Goose brand undershirts, not to mention adults can't do without them, every child in my family likes to wear them.</p>

<h3>Northeast Four Battalion Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Coldly Observing the Sentimental Battlefield of Sweetness and Bitterness, Assessing the Two Sides, Secretly Agreeing on Three Years Amidst Treacherous Roads</p>
<p>As he spoke, he walked ahead. Guan and Yin followed closely behind. As they entered the main gate, Gui Zhi was just cleaning out the coal ash from the white stove, intending to dump it outside. When she saw Guan Yaowu, she stood there blankly, just staring. Guan Yaowu was also startled when he saw her and asked, "Aren't you Cousin Gui Zhi?" Gui Zhi replied, "Yes, are you Cousin Guan from the Guan family? I heard you were in Shanhaiguan, when did you return to Beiping? Oh my, Cousin Guan from the Guan family has come!" She put down the basket of coal ash and turned to run inside. Jiang Shi, asking about the Guan family cousin, came out to greet him. Guan Yaowu had already left Yin and Zhao and walked into the Yang family's courtyard. Seeing Jiang Shi, he called out, "Auntie!" Jiang Shi smiled and said, "Good heavens, it's Cousin Guan from the Guan family! How did you find us here?" Guan Yaowu walked into the house and first bowed deeply in greeting for the New Year. He saw that although the house was two humble rooms filled with old things, it was swept clean and tidy. He thought to himself, "No wonder Old Zhao keeps praising his neighbors, it's true, not just empty talk." Jiang Shi saw him looking around the house and smiled at him, "What do you think? Our family is getting poorer and poorer, and because of that, many relatives and friends don't visit anymore. How did you know we lived here, Cousin?" Guan Yaowu said, "We didn't know! It's just that Battalion Commander Zhao in the backyard is my colleague, and we are sworn brothers. We came here today to pay respects to Old Man Zhao for the New Year." Jiang Shi said, "This Battalion Commander Zhao here always talks about a Battalion Commander Guan. Who knew it was you, Cousin? What a coincidence! I moved here in the first half of last year, it's almost been a year." Guan Yaowu said, "I didn't know Auntie lived here, if I had known, I would have come to see you long ago." Saying that, he went to the backyard to pay his respects for the New Year. At this time, Yin Deren knew that the old girl was Battalion Commander Guan's cousin, and he deeply regretted making jokes in front of him. Even Zhao Ziqiang didn't dare to say another word. Guan Yaowu saw everything in his heart. After sitting in the backyard for a while, he came back to the front and chatted with Jiang Shi and her daughter. Jiang Shi was busy serving tea. They talked about family matters, and Guan Yaowu asked if his cousin had found a husband. (66)</p>

<p>Differing Supply and Demand, Prices Hover</p>
<p>Slight Rise of $5.40 in Half-Day Gold Market</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise. Except for a sharp drop after the midday close, the process was very stable. Transactions among dealers were active. Ruixing, representing the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu, Daxing Yong, and others actively covered short positions. Speculator Mr. Wu sold a lot. Qingfa, Yongchang, and Shengyong were mainly sellers in the market. Therefore, the market fluctuated in the first half of the day. In addition, the exchange rate was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, but people's sentiment had turned tired. Otherwise, the result would have been more than a slight increase of $5.40. In the early morning, due to reports of declines in the London and New York silver markets, the exchange rate and US cotton also fell. The raw price opened with a rise to around $60. The opening price was $957.50. After the opening, it fluctuated with the exchange rate, hovering between $61 and $52.50. The midday close was $54.40. After the close, sellers suddenly surged, mainly because goods were cheap and people's sentiment was weak. The trend was not smooth. At one point, it fell below the $50 level. The spot price was quoted at $60. The spread for deferred delivery was $0.24. The market conditions for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $957.50, $8.50 higher than yesterday's close. The opening price for goods was $8. The opening exchange rate was tight.

When Mitsui came to buy the same month at $8.875, Daxing Yong and Yuansheng Yong all entered, reaching $61. Huabi suddenly placed orders for US dollars for July delivery at $75. Hengxing sold contracts, while Ruixing bought, struggling around $60.

Qingfa Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Yuankang, Xiangyuan, and Shengyong scrambled to sell. HSBC and Mitsui both sold US dollars for July delivery at $81.25. Although Ruixing bought, it still fell to $5.30. HSBC announced the quoted exchange rates, British small 125, US small 375. Zhifeng Yong and Daxing Yong all entered, although it rose to $7 outside, but it still fell because Citibank came out with US dollars for June delivery at $62.5. Soon it released US dollars for June delivery at $68.75. Daxing Yong suddenly came to sell, for $4. Ruixing bought contracts. Macari bought US dollars for August delivery at $06.25. Mitsui shorted US dollars for July delivery at $9.375, rising back to $6.20. Soon the exchange rate became hard.

Hongli came up to sell, to $4 inside. Chunyuan Yong and Daxing Yong sold even more, down to $1.50, and then it stabilized. After fluctuating for a long time, Mitsui shorted US dollars for August delivery at $12.5, which was released by the Dalian gang. Zhifeng Yong, Fuchang, and Hengyu all entered at $6. Yuanmao Yong, Yuansheng Yong, and Bingxing then entered at $7. Dongya placed orders for US dollars for August delivery at $06.25, slightly dropping $1. Soon, because US dollars for July delivery at $8.75 were difficult to close, Bingxing bought again, and then it rose to $7.70. Finally, the bank's intention was to sell off, and it still fell. Zhifeng Yong and others slightly released, and the closing price was $954.40. After the close, the goods market was fiercely suppressed, and a wave of decline suddenly rose, once falling to within $1, but the closing price was still $52.50, slightly suppressed compared to the gold industry. The highest price for the first half of the day was $961, and the lowest price was $952.50, with a rise and fall of $8. As a result, it rose $5.40 more than the previous close.</p>

<p>Banks Are Still Closed</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate Surprisingly Reemerges</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market conditions were that the banks had been closed for half a day for three days, which had made the market very cold. Transactions in the money houses were sluggish, without significant ups and downs, resulting in no interbank lending rate quotations. Early and midday transactions were all white loans. As a result, the amount of bill clearing could not be calculated. Approximately over 5 million was transferred and new transactions, over 1 million was transacted in the midday market and by small associations. Water additions rose to 28-29 cents. Bank collections and settlements, foreign firms collected and settled over 5.1 million silver dollars and over 5.3 million silver credits, and 1 million went into storage.

Copper coins steadily increased, with yesterday's increase being 1,000 cash, totaling 311,000 cash. Slightly less than 39,500 strings were traded. Securities: The Bond Market in a Quandary</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange yesterday was initially quite tense. Because of the unfavorable war situation and the lack of hope for a concrete resolution in diplomatic circles, most people expected the market to be small. Therefore, there was quite a bit of short selling on the trading floor in order to seek short-term profits. Unexpectedly, the opening price showed no sign of being small for demobilization, the most the troop reduction tax fell was two or three cents, and the salt tax fell by only five cents to one cent and five cents. Because there was quite a need for the 21st, the market relied on it to maintain itself, which was beyond the expectations of those who shorted on the trading floor. In the second round, the 11th also had buyers, and the trading floor changed course upon seeing the wind, causing the market to rise instead, with a uniform rebound of five cents to one or two cents. As a result, the shorts backed down. The afternoon opening and closing rounds saw few sellers, and retail investors bought in. The market price was good by two or three cents in each round. As a result, the market price rose by fifteen cents to forty-five cents, and the trend seemed to be slightly active. In general, it still did not break free from hovering. At this time, the war situation, whether Tianjin would be spared, and whether diplomacy in the Washington Conference would be beneficial, had a great impact on the rise and fall of the market. The bond market was at this crossroads, so it could not help but hover uncertainly, in a dilemma. From this, we can see the anxiety of the people. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 5,968,000 yuan, including 8,000 yuan in spot goods. Futures salt tax accounted for 2,185,000, troop reduction accounted for slightly more than 1,000,000, the 20th customs accounted for 680,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 350,000. 10 shares of the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange were traded, with a price of 44 yuan, up 4 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Weakens Then Strengthens</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Tuesday (the 9th), New York stocks and commodities were weakened because of widespread rumors that France and the Netherlands might abandon the gold standard, and the US dollar continued to rise, resulting in many bulls in stocks and commodities taking profits. However, the US dollar rebounded before the close, and the stock market also strengthened as a result. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 2.24 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Yarn and Flowers: Scattered Profit-Taking for Standard Yarn</p>
<p>People's Standard Opens Flat, Then Falls</p>
<p>The yarn market opened quietly in the morning. Then, because increased households took profits, it fell. In the afternoon, it was heard that customer sales were still good, and the trend was more stable.

As a result, the People's Standard results for each month fell by six cents to one yuan. The total number of transactions for the whole day was counted at 20,700 bales. It was found that Hengda sold 850 bales, Daji sold 350 bales, Yichang sold 1,350 bales, and Xiesheng sold 900 bales.

<p>Silk and Tea: Recent News of Spring Silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>(Yangzhong) Surrounded by rivers on all sides, in recent years, farmers have suffered losses in sericulture, and the silkworm capital has suffered heavy losses. They are very discouraged about sericulture. This year, the weather is abnormal, and the mulberry trees in the four villages have been slow to sprout. Now they are finally producing leaves. Those who have mulberry fields in the areas of Laolang Street, Matou Bridge, Sanmao Palace, Xinba, Xinglong Town, and Youfang Bridge have all borrowed capital to purchase improved varieties for breeding. The weather was sunny and warm when the ants were collected, and the silkworm ants developed well. The early batch has already had its third sleep and is producing leaves, while the late batch has just had its third sleep. It is a pity that the amount of feeding is limited.</p>
<p>(Xinchang) This year, the local silkworms that farmers bred early were completely abandoned due to damage from the weather, and the sericulture economy was in dire straits. Those who supplemented the late silkworms all cherished their capital to purchase breeds. Fortunately, the climate was sunny and warm, and the silkworm ants developed smoothly. The leaf production in the four villages was also abundant, and the leaf price was not high. Currently, the earliest silkworms in the Huangze area have entered a large sleep, the next earliest have had their third sleep and are producing leaves, and the latest have just started their third sleep and are waking up. Soon, the early silkworms will be able to make cocoons.</p>
<p>Gongbu Cocoon Shops Prepare to Open Weighing</p>
<p>The earliest cocoon season in Hangzhou is in the Linping, Gaosi, and Sanbao areas, where the early silkworms are about to form cocoons. Therefore, the cocoon shops in the Gongchen Bridge area are preparing to open weighing. However, only a few shops have rented out, reportedly only Weicheng and four or five others. They are currently renewing their cocoon certificates in preparation for weighing and collecting new cocoons.</p>
<p>Suian New Tea Continues to Open</p>
<p>Since the opening of Wenzhou green tea a few days ago, Suian Zhuangzhen Mei green tea continued to open yesterday. New goods from local Zhuang also opened new prices one after another. A total of more than 380 boxes of Zhen Mei and Zhen Mei needle tea were purchased by banks such as Xiehe and Tongfu. Suian Zhen Mei top plate opened at 155 yuan, local Zhuang Zhen Mei at 130 yuan, and needle tea at 45-6 yuan. Compared with the opening price last year, the main purpose is to change both into yuan. Most Chinese tea merchants have suffered losses. However, in recent days, the tea-producing areas of Suian, Huzhou, Xiaoshan, Dananshan, and Yang'ao have seen their hearts soften because the Shanghai market has failed to revitalize, and the market has plummeted by more than 10 yuan to 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Heshia Rice Prices Continue to Fall by 1-2 Cents</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources, and both retail and wholesale were still sluggish, resulting in few transactions as before. The market was flat. Su Tong geng and Nangang rice prices fell slightly. Although there were thin early rice deals, both the North and South Ocean gangs continued to handle them, but the number was not large. For example, the North Ocean gang only had 1,000 packages, and the South Ocean gang had 3-400 packages. Moreover, the methods adopted were different. The North Ocean selected high-quality materials, and the South Ocean agreed to the middle grade. The buying volume was still harsh, as if they would not take anything less than small. As a result, the prices of Qing, Yong, Songjiang, Sifeng, Xilian, and other goods fell by 2 cents. Only the prices of a small number of retail transactions seemed to be stable. Du Yangjian also fell slightly. The price of Yinbian Yuan lacked goods and had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were seventy-eight sources from Heshia. Bai geng sales were slightly traded, and the market was determined to be high-quality. The middle grade was soft. Early thin rice arrived and sold well, and the price was also stable. The port customers Xian Gao of Mei Jian and She Jian was flat and fair. The middle grade had little up or down. The Yinbian Yuan was flat.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Fall Unanimously</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, all months showed signs of a unanimous decline. Because of the quotation for foreign wheat, both American and Kant fell by about 7-8 cents, the people's hearts were not uplifted after the opening. This month fell more than 1 cent, and the forward month fell by 1-1/2 cents. Until the later rounds, because large and small factories all sold, the amount was around 100,000 packages, and the market atmosphere was quiet again. Therefore, by the close, the forward month had fallen by 2 cents. By the afternoon opening, it was still flat and sluggish at first. Because transactions turned clear again, and the sellers were quiet, the hearts of outsiders turned stable again, returning nearly a cent from the morning's lowest price. According to the various factories, it was heard that they still had many chips in hand, so when they encountered an opportunity, they still could not avoid selling pressure. As a result, this month fell by 7 and a half cents, June fell by 1 cent and 2 and a half cents, July, August, and September fell by 1 cent, and October fell by 1 cent and 2 and a half cents.</p>
<p>New Wheat Has Hope for a Good Harvest</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was flat and sluggish. Because the quotation for foreign wheat fell by 7-8 cents, people's hearts in the market were unstable. However, current transactions ultimately had little development. Because the foreign wheat reserves of the various factories could still be used for two or three months, and domestic new wheat could also be harvested in another month, recent forecasts in the various producing areas have had good prospects for a good harvest. Therefore, the future of the wheat market is feared to be more difficult than the flour market. As a result, May and June did not open, July, August, and September each fell by 3 cents, and October did not open.</p>
<p>Qingzhong Bean Cakes Sell Smoothly</p>
<p>Because the bean cake market's factory cake quotations were higher than customer cakes, traders who distribute to the hinterland mainly used customer cakes. Moreover, customer cakes had better color and amount. Therefore, the buying side was also happy to accept them. Yesterday, only 2,000 pieces of Niuzhuang Xiyisheng cake were traded. Qingzhong cakes sold 10,000 pieces alone. Although the opening price was on the original pan, the atmosphere was quite stable.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Benchmark Gold Continues to Rise; Sugar Market Is Particularly Tight</p>
<p>Rough Sand White Also Rises by 2 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was particularly tight because benchmark gold continued to rise and the Dutch exchange rate shrank. The guild's pan for dividing the cost of two-four rough sand white for the initial market of ordinary goods was divided at 20 yuan and 4 cents, rising by 1 and a half cents compared to the previous day. The higher price for the later market was divided at 20 yuan and 3 cents. No. 20 medium sand white was priced at 19 yuan and 6 cents. Nos. 8 and 9 Dutch red were priced at 16 yuan and 1 cent, with a slight amount of transactions, up by 5 cents. The factory pan had Changxing Bank opening the Guanghua Sugar Factory Lu character at 20 yuan and 4 and a half cents, Shou character at 19 yuan and 9 cents, and ground sand plus wide package at 20 yuan and 6 cents. It also opened RA cotton Dutch white at 21 yuan and 3 and a half cents, with thousands of bags traded. In the later market, because the two-five rough flower sellers in the market all wanted to raise the price, the ground sand was to be raised to 20 yuan and 7 cents, and the various cotton sugars would also be tightened one step before they would be willing to trade again. The number pan had the Guangdong Chao gang opening more than 160 packages of Hainan red, with a price of 13 yuan and 4 cents to 3 cents. Chaoqing top premium village called 13 yuan unopened, and ordinary goods were traded for hundreds of packages, with a price of 12 yuan to 11 yuan and 3 cents. The standard Five Blessings White Ice opened at 100 boxes yesterday, with a price of 17 yuan and 6 cents per piece, falling by 4 cents compared to before. Previously, a certain brand had been counterfeited, because the Five Blessings factory planned to thoroughly investigate, and a certain brand knew that it was unreasonable and had stopped counterfeiting to avoid negotiations. There is no need to worry about any disturbances in the later market.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Longkou Noodles Are Becoming Cheaper</p>
<p>Only 20 Yuan and 6 Cents</p>
<p>Recently, the customer disk of Longkou noodles has been seen to loosen from time to time. After entering customs at 21 yuan, the market was seen to continue to decline yesterday, with a total of 170 pieces opened, with a price of 20 yuan and 2 cents, which was 4 cents smaller than the previous pan. The highest price this year must have been 25 yuan and 6-7 cents, with a decline of up to 5 and a half yuan, which can be said to be extremely cheap.</p>

<h3>Flowers and Women's Rights</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The unshakeable old-style pharmacists, whenever they compounded medicine, always adhered to the traditional ideas of thousands of years, which was to refuse "chickens, dogs, and women" entry. Similar to the Westerners' former parks, which didn't allow "dogs and Chinese" entry, it was the same kind of insult. Therefore, I believe that the avoidance of "chickens, dogs, and women" during medicine compounding is a barbaric habit that violates women's rights and must be overthrown.</p>
<p>Although the promotion of women's rights in the 20th century is said to be a matter of human effort, isn't it also the will of heaven? I see that in the natural world, many kinds of flowers and plants speak up for women, so I understand that promoting women's rights is the will of heaven.</p>
<p>First, there are orchids. The secret to growing orchids is that every morning, you must wipe them with a comb that has hair oil and grime on it. Then the flowers will bloom fragrantly, especially with a woman's hand, which is most suitable. The Master of Huainan said: "If a man plants orchids, they are beautiful but not fragrant, their feelings do not intertwine." It can be seen that orchids are close to women and disgusted with men. If China had a female president or female chairman, then orchids, which advocate for women's rights, would definitely be necessary to be considered as the national flower. Second, there is the "afraid of wife grass". This grass comes from Si'en Prefecture in Guangxi. As the name suggests, it can represent the authority of wives. Each plant produces more than ten leaves, shaped like a phoenix tail, and the flowers are light yellow, growing on the corner of walls. If it gets close to a man, the leaflets will move on their own; as long as a woman steps forward and shouts, the grass becomes timid and dare not move! Fearing women and not fearing men is the characteristic of "afraid of wife grass."</p>
<p>Third, there is the "female fragrant, male stinky grass". There is a passage recorded in the Jian Gu Ji, which roughly says: "This grass, when worn by women, smells fragrant for several miles; when worn by men, it produces a strange odor. In the past, a husband on the sea picked up this grass, disliked its stench, and discarded it. A woman picked it up, and the grass became very fragrant; the man followed her, wanting to take back the grass; the woman ran quickly, and he couldn't catch up. Therefore, it is said: 'If you want to know that a woman is strong, turning stench into fragrance.'" In the past, when I read Dream of the Red Chamber, I saw Lin Daiyu often scolding men as smelly men, and I thought it was Lin Daiyu's arbitrary judgement. Now I understand that Lin Daiyu's words also have a basis. I guess she read this story of "female fragrant, male stinky grass", so she gave the men the epithet of "stinky." Furthermore, in the market, in cheap silk shops and foreign goods stores, whenever female customers, especially modern women, come to the door, the shop assistants are willing to give an extra inch or two. If male customers come to the door, they cannot get such rights. I think these shop assistant gentlemen are probably incarnations of "female fragrant, male stinky grass." Hehe.</p>
<h3>Elixir of Immortality</h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>Please have the eaves-flying, wall-walking, acupoint-striking, and sword-immortal experts hired by our esteemed country fight against the Japanese soldiers who wear the Taishang Laojun's "Hurry, hurry, as the statutes command!" talisman, or the divine soldiers who have eaten the elixir of immortality researched by Mr. Moriichi Tsuchida of Osaka University. In the end, who will lose and who will win, we can only wait for the next installment.</p>
<p>Flying eaves, walking walls, striking acupoints, and sword immortals are the treasures of our national essence: "Hurry, hurry, as the statutes command!" The divine talisman and the elixir of immortality of Qin Shi Huang are also our national essence, but they were stolen by the Japanese and made into magic weapons. With a flash of sword light and a shout of "hit", I don't know if it can kill the Japanese soldiers wearing the divine talisman? With a point of two fingers, I don't know if it can kill the Japanese who have eaten the elixir of immortality? Each showing their expertise, it's quite a sight to see! Of course, the League of Nations, after seeing it, will gnash their teeth, shiver, and turn pale. Therefore, there will be no Second World War. The Far East will not have any storms, wouldn't it all be thanks to the magic weapons?</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun: "Qin Shi Huang sent Xu Fu to Japan to seek the elixir of immortality. Xu Fu arrived in Japan and worked hard to study it. As a result, he invented a kind of immortal medicine. The principle of this medicine has been researched by Mr. Moriichi Tsuchida of the Brewing Department of the Faculty of Engineering of Osaka University, and its ingredients are known to be: (1) Ginseng (2) Cloves (3) Fennel (4) Branch Orchid (5) Angelica sinensis (6) Rhubarb (7) Chuanxiong, etc., combined together. Mr. Tsuchida has created a kind of longevity wine and is testing it in the Brewing Laboratory of the Faculty of Engineering, making a strange and fragrant medicinal wine." Ha! Ha! The Japanese really know how to play tricks. I believe this news has two effects: (1) To anesthetize their soldiers, and has the same eye-stimulating effect as the "divine talisman." (2) To anesthetize the ignorant Chinese people, to promote their medicinal materials. Jilin ginseng originally didn't have much tonic effect, it was only used by our esteemed country's merchants to deceive and make money. The leakage of Korean ginseng is about millions per year, and now with the addition of ginseng leakage, it is even more alarming. Furthermore, eating a large amount of fennel is poisonous, rhubarb causes diarrhea, chuanxiong and angelica are just for promoting blood circulation. Eating this "elixir of immortality" may not necessarily lead to immortality, I'm afraid it will lead to a quick death!</p>
<p>After the Japanese die, they are all "cremated", and the warlords and chaebols are all just a pinch of "dust"! If this elixir of immortality is really effective, then building fences under the sea, reclaiming land, and invading foreign countries would be especially important for them. Let me copy a poem:</p>
<p>Morality of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, fame of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, heroes of the Five Hegemons made a ruckus in the marketplace, and power rose and fell in an instant.</p>
<p>How many lines of names in the history books? Countless barren mounds in Beiman Mountain! Our ancestors worked the land, and now we reap the rewards. What's there to say about the dragon and tiger fights!</p>
<h3>Today to Hong Temple</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Waking up early every day is my habit. The weather these few days has been very mild, and it's especially easy to get up in the morning. Today, I came out of my residence and walked west along Nanjing Road, intending to go to Jing'an Temple Road. Who knew that when I reached the Sidu Temple (commonly known as Hongli), I looked inside and saw that the incense was very prosperous. Suddenly, I remembered that today was the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. Our general public (the government is implementing the Gregorian calendar, but you are complying in appearance but opposing in reality, "going your own way") taking the small to compare to the big, it is conceivable that there are countless followers of this kind of conservatism, especially in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Walking into the Sidu Temple, I used a calm gaze to observe the general pilgrims and analyze them, and I got the following kinds: (1) the unemployed, (2) the disturbed (the above belong to men), (3) those who take burning incense as a matter of duty, (4) those who hope that the gods will bless the development of their XX business, (5) those who are escorted (the above belong to women), and many others that are inexplicable.</p>
<p>The unemployed people's expressions seem to hang their entire chaotic thoughts. When he puts his head on the prayer mat with sincerity, and thinks of the respect of more than three kneelings and five kowtows, at least he is unemployed now.</p>
<p>The wavering state of those who are restless is also very obvious. When he is holding a lottery ticket in his hand, staring intently with both eyes, probably this lottery ticket must be a low one!</p>
<p>Those who take burning incense as a matter of duty, this is another kind of woman. They have a yellow cloth bag hanging around their waists, meaninglessly writing the name of X family in X village, and below it is written in larger letters: "Pilgrimage to Mount." I really don't know what "mountain" they are visiting? There is also a young woman, with a big "Buddha" character written on the yellow cloth bag hanging on her, and that Buddha character just happened to be covering the lower part of her waist. I think "if the Buddha has a spirit, he should also cry injustice."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, business women are wearing modern coats and holding an old 18th-century incense basket in their hands. When they bow down, they seem to be silently chanting something in their small mouths! This must be secretly praying to the gods for the development of their business.</p>
<p>There are also some who are escorted, and their expressions are very ugly, their hair is disheveled like messy grass, and their faces are withered and yellow like broken wax. They also mechanically insert incense and light candles; I see them as if they are in a dream.</p>
<p>There is also a young man wearing a suit who is also kneeling and kowtowing. This should belong to the "restless" category.</p>
<p>Using an average estimate, each person spends half a dollar on: Yuanbin sandalwood, candles, paper ingots, scriptures, etc. In that one hour, there were: forty-three old women, seventy-six young women, fifty-one middle-aged women, twenty-three young men, nineteen old men and old women, and other children who came along and onlookers like me are not counted.</p>
<p>Looking at the red-hot furnace and the smoke curling up, I thought of the great battle in Luan East, which made people shudder!</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's article selling children, the fourth character "小" (small) in the title was a misprint of the character "子" (child).</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Drafted into the Army (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tian Hensheng</p>
<p>"What can we do? It's not just one family's business. There must be many people in our village who should be drafted. How can we come up with a solution!"</p>
<p>"If there's no solution, are we just going to let him go? Once he leaves, when will he come back? Will he be able to come back? Heavens!" She couldn't help but cry out of disappointment again, leaning on the table, no longer asking Old Man Yang to come up with a solution. She was hopeless!</p>
<p>Old Man Yang originally loved this daughter. When she was unmarried, she got whatever she wanted, and he never wanted to disappoint her. This time, she encountered something he couldn't do anything about, but it was related to his daughter's life, and he didn't have a son himself, and he would have to rely on this son-in-law to take care of him in the future. Suddenly, her son-in-law was drafted into the army. How could he not feel heartbroken! At this time, hearing his daughter say "Will he be able to come back?", he immediately realized: This fighting is such a dangerous thing, guns and cannons have no eyes, and his son-in-law's departure is mostly ominous! But he couldn't say these words to his daughter, and for a moment he didn't have any words to comfort his daughter, so he had to let her cry miserably!</p>
<p>The aunt came in from outside, and she wasn't surprised to see this situation. She already knew that her niece must be crying because her niece's husband was drafted into the army; and she had already seen four or five families crying in the same way. Although she felt pity, she didn't feel as much pain as Old Man Yang. She had a different kind of psychology. Seeing other people's families crying, it was as if the pent-up resentment that other people's families had intentionally or unintentionally given her was vented, and the feeling of injustice subsided. That was because she had no sons and no daughters.</p>
<p>Old Man Yang was sighing with his head down, and Gou Guniang was crying. They didn't even notice the aunt entering the door.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! Gou Guniang is also crying because of the draft, right? What a sin! But, what's the use of just crying!" The aunt originally didn't have sympathy, and Gou Guniang knew it too. Moreover, she didn't like this aunt when she was unmarried. Hearing these words, she didn't raise her head.</p>
<p>Old Man Yang wasn't answering the aunt either, he was just talking to himself, "Sigh! What a sin! Why did the war start for no reason! Chen Laowu came back from the city and talked about the fighting outside. He said it was very far from here, so why did they come here to draft soldiers? Could it be that the people who were fighting have already been killed!"</p>
<p>"My aunt's family is also crying in a mess!" the aunt said.</p>
<p>Old Man Yang seemed surprised, looked at the aunt, and said, "Doesn't she only have two sons?"</p>
<p>"Even with two, one has to be drafted!"</p>
<p>"Did she agree to let him be drafted?"</p>
<p>"How could she not agree. A'gui's courage isn't small, he's not afraid, saying that he can't get out of it, so he'll just go, it's not like going there means death. But A'gui's wife is crying even harder than our Gou Guniang!"</p>
<p>"That's understandable!" Old Man Yang nodded.</p>
<p>"There's no need to cry like that!" The aunt was feeling another kind of injustice: "She didn't try to stop A'gui, but she grabbed onto my aunt, wanting my aunt to not allow A'gui to go; if A'gui went, she would ask my aunt for a husband, which made my aunt even more embarrassed!"</p>
<p>"What's going to happen now?"</p>
<p>"A'gui hasn't left yet, and she's already so unreasonable, crying and rolling on the ground, wanting my aunt to watch over her husband for her. When A'gui leaves in the future, won't she be even more clingy to my aunt? My aunt has spoiled this daughter-in-law too much in the past, and now she's climbing on top of her mother-in-law. She's afraid that her daughter-in-law will make trouble in the future, so she's trying to find a way to leave!"</p>
<p>"What can we do?" Old Man Yang was very strange, and asked the aunt in return.</p>
<p>"You should also help me find a way!" Gou Guniang suddenly jumped up, grabbed Old Man Yang's hand, and pushed him, saying: "If Aunt can find a way, then you can also find a way for me. Dad, do you think I'm easy to talk to? If Xiao Niu is drafted, I'll also ask you for a husband!" Gou Guniang suddenly also became unreasonable, but she didn't cry. But her unreasonableness was different from A'gui's wife, she was being coquettish.</p>

<h3>The Art of Business (12)</h3>
<p>Tea Parties in the Hardware Industry</p>
<p>Tea Party Time</p>
<p>Those in the hardware industry who do tea party business are called "tea party runners". The goods they sell are all hardware products in the construction category. There are about fifteen or sixteen companies in the local industry that do tea party business. The larger ones are Yuanzhuang, Xinrenchang, Yuanyang, Yuansheng, etc. The time is from 4 pm to 8 pm. Their route is from 4 pm to 6 pm at Touji Bridge Luochun Pavilion Tea House, and from 6 pm to 8 pm at the Great Ma Road Tongyu Spring, Yile Tian, and Si Ma Road Changle Tea House. In addition, Tianchan on Si Ma Road and Guihua Hall in the city are available at any time. Therefore, the largest market is the Luochun Pavilion Tea House. The number of people who come there includes foreign firms, construction lumber companies, and fellow industry companies. They negotiate the price of goods with foreign firms. They talk about the price of slow-moving goods with fellow industry and domestic companies. Construction companies only discuss the location where they are needed and the goods that are needed. However, they do not discuss the price level. The price is filled in on the invoice when the goods are delivered (usually three or four cents to one or two taels higher than the market price). Payment procedures are either at the end of the small or large month, or after the landlord receives the payment, or only once a month, or there are also cash payments. Therefore, the price level has to fluctuate accordingly.</p>
<p>The salespeople who run tea parties in the industry are called "tea party runners". The managers who run tea parties are called "upper tea parties". They have to pay a tea fee of one yuan per person. As for the hardware products in terms of business, there are dozens of varieties such as bamboo steel, cement, triangular iron, steel wire mesh, new ocean yuan, French West fasteners, corrugated iron oil wool felt, etc. There are also large transactions for asphalt.</p>
<p>Tea Shop Business</p>
<p>There are about five tea shop groups in Shanghai, including Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hangshao, and Guangdong. The most powerful is the Anhui group, followed by the Hangshao group. The hardware products they handle are only four kinds: small green lead bars, number two white lead sheets, ten-pound tinplate, and one-inch two-point five French West needles. Tea shops call white lead sheets zinc sheets or zinc skins. Tinplate is called Xiaoxin Iron. French West nails are called iron wire nails. The purchasing season is every year at the end of the year and the beginning of the year, at the latest until April or May. After this, it is a period of stagnation. Transactions are either cash or term. It is stipulated during negotiations. The goods handled by the tea shops are handled by tea merchants in the mountains. The payment is advanced by the tea shops. Therefore, the tea shops have a deduction when purchasing goods. (That is, a handling fee of 0.995 or 0.9975). However, there are also cases where there is no deduction. Therefore, the seller must make it clear in advance, otherwise, there will be mistakes. The local companies that do this kind of business are Ke Chi, Yichang, Yuxianglong and other companies.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>"What good things can we show them?"</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Children grow up year after year, and in addition to toys and snacks, they also ask for "spiritual food." Children of seven or eight years old are still easy to deal with; we have publications such as "Children's World" and "Little Friends." When they are eleven or twelve years old, they are no longer interested in stories about dog brothers and cat sisters, but they cannot understand general literary readings. So, the parents are very embarrassed.</p>
<p>Writers have already seen this point. The World Juvenile Literature Series and other similar books are published in response to this demand. But on the one hand, the quantity is not large, and on the other hand, the translation is too Europeanized, so the children's strong intellectual hunger cannot be satisfied. As a result, they find their own "way out": those with a higher level go to dig through old book piles, Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, Water Margin, Journey to the West, are still considered good. Those who are worse than that swallow all the cases of Shi Gong, the biography of Ji Gong, and all martial arts myths; children with a lower level regard "comic strip novels" as treasures. The children who have discovered their own "new world" feel that "Treasure Island," "King of the Golden River" and other similar books are boring, difficult to understand, and not to their taste.</p>
<p>"What good things can we show them?" Parents with ideas are probably often worried like this.</p>
<p>Some people have high standards and think that old novels with feudal consciousness such as Seven Heroes and Five Gallants are of course poisonous, and even Western juvenile literature such as "Treasure Island" is unhealthy, so children nowadays simply have nothing to read. This is naturally true. It's a pity that we can't give up eating because of choking. And children will secretly rent and watch all kinds of "poisons," and no method can stop it.</p>
<p>I think the immediate solution is——</p>
<p>Friends who are enthusiastic about children's literature unite to study why their releases are not enthusiastically liked by children.</p>
<p>Select relatively "hygienic" materials and compile or translate them in a planned way; but whether it is compiling or translating, don't make the language too Europeanized.</p>
<p>These are two principles. As for the specific methods, naturally, it needs full discussion. People who have children at home clamoring "want to read books" and authors who compile and translate children's books! Isn't this problem worth paying attention to?</p>
<h3>Man-Made Earthquake</h3>
<p>— Shiyi</p>
<p>When Bernard Shaw met with Minister Araki in Japan, Araki said to him: "It's a pity that you, old gentleman, didn't encounter an earthquake in Japan. Only after encountering an earthquake can you understand the superior national character of Japan." The old man Shaw's reply was: "If you were the Prime Minister of England, you would definitely bury bombs underground and create man-made earthquakes."</p>
<p>Although General Araki did not come to China to be the chairman, there are indeed many people in China who are processing and rushing to make man-made earthquakes.</p>
<p>Not to mention the imported and "domestic" airplanes, bombs, and tanks that are making earthquakes rumble in the "border areas" and "hinterland" every day. What about the foreign commodities that are flooding in and the incredible miscellaneous taxes, aren't they also shaking the countryside with man-made earthquakes. The people of Gansu and Shaanxi are destroying their own residences in order to avoid the army collecting housing taxes. This earthquake is already being made by themselves without waiting for it to be man-made. The army digs dikes due to attacks, and local tyrants embezzle public funds and do not repair dikes, forming a great flood that covers sixteen provinces, which is even more of a man-made tsunami following the man-made earthquake.</p>
<p>Araki thought that earthquakes cultivated the Japanese people and their superiority, which was for external development. In China, the result of this man-made earthquake has indeed cultivated the superiority of external development. For example, landlords in the interior move to concessions to be absentee landlords, and take their property to the safe deposit boxes of foreign banks. However, some people who have no homes to move to and no property to deposit seem to have no way to cultivate this kind of superiority, and can only groan in the man-made earthquake forever.</p>
<p>So, someone said: This is a "destined bitter life." Since "bitter life" is "destined," they have to wait for the mountains to collapse and the ground to crack, and be crushed to pieces!</p>
<h3>Early Market</h3>
<p>— Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>Every morning, the bustling streets and alleys of this city are always flowing with so many people: all kinds of workers belonging to different classes, crawling like ants moving house before the rain. It's summer, and the south wind and the early dawn sky push people to the streets even earlier.</p>
<p>Vendors come one after another from the countryside or the docks, carrying burdens and panting, smiling at those who came earlier. This smile and hurried action implies a slight remorse: They are late. Selling bamboo shoots, selling fish, selling vegetables... scattered everywhere, everyone eagerly expects the customers who come to them, and always tries to gently grab him or her if the selling price has reached the point of agreement. The phrase "Okay, let's make a profit, I'll sell it to you!" contains the truth of life: People have to struggle to live. So the scale is busy, and the vendors carefully calculate how many pounds and taels and how many copper coins. This is more focused than the scholars sitting in the research room. There is no joking or mischief here, people are moving "seriously."</p>
<p>Every customer with a basket is busy looking for things: smart housewives are looking for cheap and good food, cooks are carefully calculating how to cater to the tastes of the owner, and people in rags who are pressed hard by life are discussing alone how to match the limited amount of copper coins with food and vegetables.</p>
<p>Everyone's feet crawl slowly like turtles lying in a basket. The apprentices opening the shop boards stare blankly at the people passing by on the street with greasy faces. The shouts of the carriers break the quiet air of the morning. The drivers chew on pancakes and fried dough sticks while waiting for business.</p>
<p>Everything seems to be planning for the blessed people, the street sweepers, the toilet pourers, the firewood ash collectors, and the "dry water" pourers are all people that the late-rising rich will never see and be disgusted by.</p>
<p>But these late-rising rich people will never have the opportunity to see these vivid pictures of the early market!</p>
<h3>Little Black Girl</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>I knew Little Black Girl (not to be interpreted as "Little Black Girl knew me") twelve years ago, when she was about sixteen or seventeen years old. Her younger sister and brother were both studying at Cang Sheng Public School, which I was in charge of.</p>
<p>The White Girl storyteller in *The Travels of Lao Ts'an* made us yearn for such a thing. Hearing that there was a Black Girl storyteller at the New World entertainment center, I pretended to be refined and sat in the front row to drink tea and listen to the storytelling. Like "a Shandong person eating ophiopogon root," I didn't understand a thing. I only heard the sharp notes soaring high and the low notes sinking into the abyss, the rapid parts "like a cacophony of sounds," and the slow parts "like a warbling oriole flitting between branches," vaguely resembling the White Girl in Liu E's writing. Mr. Peixian said that Bai Yunpeng of the Great World entertainment center could be called a master of his time. I only felt that Bai Yunpeng had a very dignified demeanor, but I didn't understand anything else. Coincidentally, Mr. W worked at the New World, and we could enter and exit through the side door. We often went to listen to Little Black Girl's storytelling when we had free time.</p>
<p>Soon, Black Girl announced her retirement, and Little Black Girl took her place. Black Girl was not old, and Little Black Girl's skills were still raw and weak, a far cry from her predecessor. I wondered why one was retiring while such a child was taking the lead. Little Black Girl's eyes were dark and shiny. As soon as she stepped on stage, they would dart around, followed by cheers from several places. This situation was something that Black Girl's storytelling did not have. Previously, a few elderly people would applaud when the singing was particularly moving, but now many young people were applauding while their eyes were glued to her. One evening after Little Black Girl started performing, Mr. N called me to listen to the storytelling, saying, "The New World is especially lively tonight." Upon entering, I saw a packed house, and promotional flyers for Little Black Girl were flying everywhere. Little Black Girl would sing a line, and the audience would cheer. The storytelling that night was not particularly brilliant, but the amount of applause was unprecedented. There were three or five flower baskets on the stage, and a dozen or so banners, all praising Ms. Yang XX for her "three days around the beams" and "lofty mountains and flowing water." Little Black Girl's eyes were especially bright and darted around even faster that night.</p>
<p>One day, Little Black Girl brought her younger siblings to Cang Sheng Public School for class, and I learned that she lived nearby. Black Girl could also be seen from time to time. Over time, I realized that storytelling was not an interesting job. They could only eat half a bowl or a bowl of rice per meal, and they had to eat ten or so meals a day. They wouldn't be able to go to bed until after midnight, and they often stayed up until dawn when there were private performances. Lacking energy, they resorted to opium, which made them age even faster. Every time they arrived at a new port, they had to cater to the local "gentlemen," "powerful families," and "Ping opera professionals" to win their favor. Neither Black Girl nor Little Black Girl could read, but thanks to the care and attention they received, the Little Black Girl promotional flyers and the secret edition of Black Girl's drum lyrics appeared. (The "secret edition" was actually a tattered booklet with seventy to eighty percent of the characters misspelled.) "Though the peony is beautiful, it all depends on the green leaves to support it." Storytelling girls rely half on their skills and half on things "beyond their skills." Mr. Gao, a "Little Black Girl enthusiast," asked "Little Black Girl," "It's so 'good,' 'good,' does all that cheering make you cringe?" Little Black Girl was stunned for a moment and said, "Don't you writers need other people to cheer for you?" This stumped Mr. Gao.</p>
<p>After the Little Black Girl promotional flyers were flying everywhere, Little Black Girl's reputation soared, and she quickly became a very big "star." Everyone gradually forgot about Black Girl. Coincidentally, General Chen Shufan came from Shaanxi to Shanghai to enjoy his wealth from land speculation. A hero and a beauty, fulfilling a destined romance. It is said that Little Black Girl's storytelling skills also "improved day by day, reaching a state of perfection!"</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw Little Black Girl at a storytelling venue in Beiping. Her aura was very different. Flower baskets were arranged in dense layers, and there were three to five hundred banners with "three days around the beams" and "lofty mountains and flowing water." It was like presenting a seal and worshiping a general, truly a pillar of the stage! Outside the door were two large characters: "Sold Out!" This couldn't help but make me think of "Black Girl" again! I once had a foolish thought: what would the author of *The Travels of Lao Ts'an* say if he were to ask from the underworld, "How was the White Girl back then?"</p>
<h3>Carrot Whiskers</h3>
<p>— by Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Olorin</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic: How old are you now, Olorin?</p>
<p>Olorin: I turned sixty-seven on November 1st.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic: So you're old, poor Olorin!</p>
<p>Olorin: As long as we can work, we don't feel old at all. I've never been sick. I think horses are not as sturdy as I am.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic: Would you like me to tell you something, Olorin? You will die suddenly. One evening, returning from the river, you will feel that your back basket is too heavy, and the cart is not as easy to push as usual. You will kneel between the two cart arms, your nose stuck in the washed clothes, and then you will be done. By the time people pick you up, you will have already passed away.</p>
<p>Olorin: You're joking; please don't be afraid; my legs and arms are still strong.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic: Your back is a bit hunched, that's true, but when your back is bent, washing clothes won't make your back ache so much. But your eyesight is failing, which is such a pity! Don't deny it, Olorin! I can see it.</p>
<p>Olorin: Ah! My eyes are as sharp as they were when I got married.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic: Good! Then go open the cupboard and get me a plate, any plate will do. If you had wiped the dishes clean, then how would there be this moisture?</p>
<p>Olorin: The inside of the cupboard is a bit damp.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic: Could it be that there are also some fingers touching the plates in the cupboard? Look at this fingerprint.</p>
<p>Olorin: Where is it, please show me, I didn't see it at all.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic: That's exactly what I'm blaming you for, Olorin. Listen to me. I'm not blaming you for being lazy, if I said that, then I would be wrong; in our area, I haven't seen a second woman who works as hard as you; I'm just saying you're old. I'm the same, I'm old too; when we're old, we won't be able to do what we want. I can bet: you must often feel like there's a layer of cloth over your eyes. Even if you try your best to wipe it, it's still there on your eyes.</p>
<p>Olorin: But my eyes can open wide, and I don't feel like my head is submerged in water and my eyes are blurry. Mr. Lepic: Yes, yes, Olorin, you can believe what I say. Yesterday, you gave Mr. Lepic a dirty wine glass. I didn't say a word, because I was afraid of making you sad and causing a scene. Mr. Lepic didn't say a word either. He never says anything, but nothing can escape his eyes. People think he doesn't care, but that's wrong! He observes everything, but doesn't reveal anything. He just casually pushed your wine glass away with his finger, and he was even able to just eat without drinking. I was sad for you, and also sad for him.</p>
<p>Olorin: It's strange that Mr. Lepic would be so reserved in front of his own servant! He only needs to say a word, and I would replace the glass for him.</p>
<p>Mr. Lepic: That's true, Olorin, but even someone more cunning than you couldn't make Mr. Lepic, who is determined not to speak, talk. I don't even want to try it now. And the problem isn't here. In short: your eyesight is getting worse day by day. For rough work, like washing, it's not very important, but you can't do delicate work at all. Although expenses will increase, I would rather find someone to help you, if... (Unfinished)</p>

<p>Informal Discussions</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>— Niu</p>
<p>The saying goes, "A scholar doesn't step out of his gate, yet knows the affairs of the world." I truly admire the intelligence of scholars of the past. In the past, scholars didn't have newspapers to read, and yet they knew the affairs of the world. Now I run around every day and open the newspaper to read, but there are many things I don't understand when I read the news. I'm truly ashamed. Today I'll just bring up a few examples for consideration.</p>
<p>A Nanjing dispatch on the 7th stated that Dai Chuanxian invited over seventy teachers and students from Guangdong in Beijing to jointly transcribe Sun Yat-sen's Last Will and Testament. It was placed in a copper box, encased in a stone case, and a pagoda was built near the mausoleum to store it for posterity. At 8:00 AM on the 7th, a foundation-laying ceremony was held. When the stone case was being lowered from the top of the pagoda with a rope, the rope broke halfway and the case shattered. This is a strange event.</p>
<p>The Last Will and Testament of the Premier is extremely precious and should be stored in a famous mountain and passed on to future generations. Building a pagoda to store it is not unusual. But for such a grand ceremony, the equipment must have been carefully prepared. How could the rope have broken and the stone case shattered? It's truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Also, in a dispatch from the same day, Gao Youtang, a member of the Control Yuan, submitted an impeachment of Zhang Xueliang last month, accusing him of stealing ancient paintings from the Summer Palace. It stated, "Later, after Zhang Ji sent a stern telegram demanding their return, he admitted that they were stored in the Tianjin Concession. Even if they can be returned intact in the future, Zhang has already committed the crime of embezzlement under criminal law." After the Control Yuan sent it to Li Menggeng for review, he believed that it should be immediately handed over for disciplinary action and submitted it to the National Government to be handed over to the Central Public Servant Disciplinary Committee for disciplinary action. This matter is also a bit strange.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xueliang left, two cases of theft were discovered. One was the sale of the site of the Navy Hospital to a certain concession authority, and the other was the theft of ancient paintings from the Summer Palace. Now, Gao Youtang of the Control Yuan only impeaches Zhang Xueliang for stealing ancient paintings, but does not mention the sale of the Navy Hospital site. This is also incomprehensible.</p>
<p>In a dispatch from Beiping on the same day, this morning a Chinese youth entered a room in the Six Nations Hotel, fired two shots at an elderly Chinese man, seriously wounding him, and then calmly escaped in a car waiting outside the door. The name of the injured guest on the register was Zhang Shihang (actually Zhang Jingyao). He was sent to the German Hospital and died this afternoon. Strangely, Mr. Zhang himself denied being shot, claiming that his injury was caused by an electric shock.</p>
<p>Zhang Jingyao, as a traitor, knew that his crimes were heinous, so he changed his name to Shihang. Even after being assassinated this time, he could only admit his bad luck. It wouldn't be good to say that he was killed because he was a traitor. This is a trace of remaining conscience that the traitor showed when he was on his last breath, so he vehemently denied being shot. But it's incomprehensible why some unfilial children dressed him in a red-topped official hat, peacock feather, embroidered python robe, and a large dragon robe when Zhang was put in his coffin, making him look like a living traitor. They insist on presenting his stench, which is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>A Career Selling Writing</h3>
<p>— Peng Nian</p>
<p>Selling writing: What an unpleasant and hated term!</p>
<p>. But for those so-called people who come out of universities today, in this society where "there's no place to give birth to me," it's really hard to find a better place than a career selling writing. Therefore, the number of people in society who live by selling writing is increasing day by day. The founding of newspapers and the addition of supplements are also developing like bamboo shoots after rain. Although this helps society and the country to some extent, it is also the only art of living for writers when they reach the end of their rope.</p>
<p>Because I was tormented by life and couldn't find a "place to live me," these two reasons forced me to embark on the path of selling writing. And only selling writing can live me. Now I take writing as my only way to survive. The supplements of newspapers are the most fertile place of production for me, and also the most precious and supreme "field" to "live me."</p>
<p>But selling writing is not easy: You pour out your heart and soul, rack your brains, write five or six hundred words, make it into an article, and you still have to prepay two cents for postage with no guarantee of a return. Then, whether the editor is destined to befriend you is still a question. Even if you have the greatest hope and it gets published, the reward is at most only one or two yuan. But how much of my heart and soul is lost in exchange for this one or two yuan reward! That's still good. Sometimes, to write an article, the tone must be a little激烈, otherwise you won't get the editor's sympathy. But the big men in the government just don't want to understand you, saying that you are from the XX faction, and immediately send a few detectives to monitor you, surrounding you, so you sigh that you can't move! If you're unlucky, you risk tasting the flavor of iron bars. Maybe they'll offer you a "sanitary pill." Wasn't Liu Yusheng our previous example?</p>
<p>Selling writing, although so scary! So painful! But my mouth is not getting any better, and my stomach is causing a storm. What method should I use to conquer it! For this reason, I can't care about so much anymore, I have to let myself drill into the hail of bullets to plan for my mouth.</p>
<h3>The Young Ladies Are Silent</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>The slightly warm spring breeze trembled all things on the earth. Although it was in a large city where spring came later, and although it was in a golden house with many gates and courtyards, one could still smell the mellow wine of spring. Every morning, the nanny would open the windows, letting in a new breath, and the young ladies would lazily stretch half their heads out of the quilt, "Oh, lovely spring morning!" After uttering a few charming words, they would get out of bed earlier than usual.</p>
<p>The eldest young lady's age, although she had passed twenty, still had the charm of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl in her prime. This was probably because she had never been married. She was already a junior in college, and had not only learned fluent Mandarin like a warbling oriole, but could also speak English. Her slender figure set off her white-red face, water-drop-like eyes, and small cherry lips. Every move was charming enough, and being a college student, her attitude was especially elegant. She was indeed worthy of pride and happiness.</p>
<p>The second young lady, although still a middle school student, was already in the sixth grade. Her age was just eighteen, and the flames of youth were burning fiercely in every cell of her. Her properly high nose bridge and apple-colored oval face were covered with two slender eyebrows, sheltering the autumn water-like eyes. Between glances, it was indeed enough to make people's souls flutter.</p>
<p>The youngest third young lady was only sixteen years old, but she could also speak English, because she attended a church middle school. Her face was full of childishness, always jumping around and never standing still. Although she was not as good at makeup and beautification as the eldest and second young ladies, she also revealed a natural girlish beauty.</p>
<p>Every day, when the young ladies went to college, a 1933 Ford car would separately pick them up and bring them back. They would jump into the courtyard, turn into the hall. The artificial wild scenery in the courtyard frequently smiled at them, and the flowers displayed in the hall spread their branches and leaves, composing a welcoming tune. The young ladies would take off their coats and chat and laugh as they pleased. One moment, the eldest young lady would teach the third young lady to sing English songs, followed by a graceful dance. Another moment, they would turn on the phonograph and play Western famous songs like "I LOVE YOU" and "March of the Soldiers." Then, they would eat and drink, and chat and laugh again. They were intoxicated in human paradise, truly happy and perfect.</p>
<p>Dusk approached, and the cries of newspaper vendors echoed outside the window. The young ladies suddenly remembered their movie night class. The eldest young lady, being a college student, said that she wanted to read the evening paper before going. So the nanny immediately bought an evening paper.</p>
<p>The atmosphere certainly changed quickly. The tide of joy that filled the entire room instantly vanished. The young ladies looked at each other, and everyone was silent. Fortunately, the nanny was standing beside them, and no matter what, they couldn't guess the truth of this mystery. "Such a perfect life for the young ladies, and yet they frowned, which is a bit ungrateful! Unjust!" The nanny murmured, and couldn't help but sneer, which made the eldest young lady furious and scolded her harshly, "Ignorant pest, get out!"</p>
<p>However, the clouds of sorrow still shrouded the faces of each of the young ladies, expressing endless depression that could not be resolved. Were they disgusted with the tyranny of the riot day? No! Were they mourning the martyred compatriots? No! Were they deeply resentful that the military men in charge of military power did not know how to defend the country, seeing the national situation in danger and the territory lost? No! Did they express regret after seeing that hundreds of laborers were killed by the explosion in the XX factory on Tangshan Road? No, it wasn't any of that!</p>
<p>It was because the eldest young lady's lover was in Chaoyang, Rehe, which had been lost, and it was really unknown whether he was good or bad. Moreover, Tianjin and Beijing were also facing a serious situation, and the lovers of the second and third young ladies were all in the dangerous city of Beiping!</p>
<h3>Dinner Party</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>It was the time when the lights were just coming on, cars were humming, and people were noisy, especially showing the hustle and bustle of the city at night.</p>
<p>"Yipinxiang, Yizhixiang, Xinghualou, Taohuagong..." These many towering restaurants in the city were full of rich young men, and the pink stationery flew, and after a while, seventeen or eighteen-year-old girls flew in.</p>
<p>The young men just had a dinner party like this: calling a few games; what the poor could get by for half a year!</p>
<p>Behind Taohuagong, on a road that never saw the light; there were alleys built one after another</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, telling you that this was the home of goddesses in the civilized city, indeed; the alleys were shrouded in a lot of mystery!</p>
<p>At this time: under the overhanging building of an alley, there were five young masters disguised as civilized beggars! Sitting on the ground with their buttocks; round table meeting? No table! Dinner party? A bit like it:</p>
<p>The civilized beggars were all young! Their faces were thin and still had the strong color of the Philippines! The clothes sewn from red and green rags and coarse and fine sacks were worn on each person; they looked like the little Taoists in Xuanmiao Temple.</p>
<p>"Please: please; we all please," these civilized beggars! They all said this in their mouths, and the chopsticks were also casually thrown into several tin cans placed flat on the ground; but there was no sign of ferocity at all.</p>
<p>After they took this chopstick, they stopped talking again:</p>
<p>"This dinner party is much happier than last time."</p>
<p>"Yes; this is all the result of the efforts of the brothers!"</p>
<p>"When you say that; I feel nervous again! Dangerous! Yesterday, when I was overturning the yellow fish in the food stall in front of the Shenbao, I was almost caught by the red-headed devils!"</p>
<p>"The day before yesterday, I overturned the cold rice at Nichengqiao! And I was beaten by a foreign monkey!"</p>
<p>"Everyone is like this; these things all came from adventure!"</p>
<p>"That's right! Things that come from adventure taste especially good!"</p>
<p>The civilized beggars talked like this, one sentence from you; one word from me, and the delicacies in the several tin cans were gradually going down 丨 At this moment; suddenly a civilized beggar took out a paper package from his body, held it in his hand and said: "Yesterday I picked up a lot of flowers in front of a mansion! It's a pity that these flowers! They have been almost killed by them! I picked them up! I carefully wrapped them in newspaper, now I'll take them out for the brothers to appreciate, you can't touch them!" After saying that; he really unwrapped the paper package, which turned out to be several white orchid flowers!</p>
<p>The moon sister showed a smiling face, gradually rising to the center of the sky, and the noise of the city night slowly subsided! Under the overhanging building of an alley, several civilized beggars were sleeping haphazardly! Several snores were mixed together, meeting the breeze and stirring up, breaking the desolation of the night in the alley!</p>
<h3>In a Certain University Dorm Room</h3>
<p>— Pu Ru</p>
<p>A room full of laughter, a room full of footsteps, a room full of Jinghu fiddle sounds: xipi, erhuang, daoban… In the white dorm room, under the milky white electric light, three beds, four tables, a messy little bookshelf, a thermos on the table, a phonograph, and a pile of scattered paper, several pens, an overturned ink bottle, a woman's portrait, with "My heart!" and "Kiss me, endlessly!" written behind it! ...</p>
<p>"Hey, what movie did you see today?"</p>
<p>"Spring Breeze and Willow Branches, what about you?"</p>
<p>"Heartbreak."</p>
<p>"How was it?"</p>
<p>"The emotion was well expressed!"</p>
<p>People in suits, people in long gowns, people wearing hats, people wearing glasses, and people in pajamas crowded into the room. Jumping, standing, sitting, there were tall ones, short ones, pale-faced ones, dark ones…</p>
<p>"Hey, Old Chen, sing 'Si Lang Visits His Mother'."</p>
<p>"Hey, play, Old Zheng! Slow tempo xipi."</p>
<p>Then, the Jinghu fiddle suddenly changed its tune. "Yang YanHui, sits...in the palace..." Old Chen in a long gown began to sing, from "Si Lang Visits His Mother" to "Water Thrown Before the Horse," then to "Second Entry to the Palace"...</p>
<p>"Bravo!" Everyone cheered.</p>
<p>"I can't sing anymore, my vocal cords can't take it."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll do it! You put on that...ah...ah..."</p>
<p>"No, let Old Li do it."</p>
<p>"Let's not play anymore, let's turn on the phonograph."</p>
<p>Opening the phonograph case, the machine was turned on, playing one record after another. Everyone sang along. "Ah, this daoban is sung so well!" Shaking his head.</p>
<p>"This, ah, ah, ah...the trailing tone is sung so skillfully!" Stomping his feet.</p>
<p>They were all amazed.</p>
<p>Only Little Xu with the hooked nose in pajamas was dancing alone; bored, he pulled Fat Zhu to dance with him, embracing him, dragging his feet on the floor. Then Old Huang with the crooked hat, Old Li with glasses, Old Zhou in a red suit, Little Wu with a pale face, and A Qin with a dark complexion all wanted to dance with him, embracing his waist, holding his hand... The dark-skinned one didn't know how to dance, so he pointed out his mistakes and taught him how to dance.</p>
<p>As they danced, the Jinghu fiddle started up again, quite smoothly. The phonograph was still singing ah, ah, ah, kuang, kuang, kuang, hei nong li dong..., but the sound was drowned out by the noise of the people, almost inaudible.</p>
<p>Dancing, singing loudly, laughing wildly, playfully fighting…</p>
<p>The door opened, and Old Hu with squinting eyes came in, carrying a stack of phonograph records and a bag of peanuts.</p>
<p>"GKKDNIGHTLFOODNIGHTL" Little Xu with the hooked nose in pajamas, leaving the dark-skinned one, went to greet him.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, Old Hu!…"</p>
<p>With a whoosh, everyone rushed forward, snatching all the peanuts first. The Jinghu fiddle stopped playing, and everyone was laughing.</p>
<p>"Hey, what records did you bring?"</p>
<p>"Foreign dance records, foreign dance records."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's switch records."</p>
<p>The machine was turned on, and the foreign dance records were played.</p>
<p>"Come, come, we're still partners."</p>
<p>Little Xu with the hooked nose started dancing with Old Hu with squinting eyes. The electric light was covered with green paper, making it greenish, and it became their dance floor.</p>
<p>The foreign records played, and they embraced and danced: waltzes, foxtrots...</p>
<p>Their dance floor became a little quieter. Everyone watched with envy: they danced so skillfully!</p>
<p>Seeing others dance so well, their hands and feet itched. So Old Zheng playing the Jinghu fiddle, and Old Huang wearing a crooked hat, Old Li with glasses, and Fat Zhu: Old Zhou in a red suit, and Little Wu with a pale face: Old Chen in a long gown, and the dark-skinned one: all embraced, in pairs, and started dancing, crowding the room. There were tall ones, short ones, pale-faced ones, dark ones...</p>
<p>Dancing, dancing, smiling, singing foreign dance songs, greenish. ...</p>
<p>Suddenly, the electric light flickered, then lit up again, then flickered again, then lit up. Finally, it went out completely.</p>
<p>"Ah, the light's gone out."</p>
<p>"It's broken."</p>
<p>With a shout, they scattered in a rush.</p>
<p>In the corridor, the sound of shoes clattering. Everyone returned to their own dorm rooms, dark and silent.</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you taking tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"It's that damn French again."</p>
<p>"We have to take Civil Law and Land Law tomorrow."</p>
<h3>Discussion on How to Be a Person</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>This world is a world of the survival of the fittest, this world is a world of treachery. The Chinese are unbearable, and foreigners are bad too. I think we need to study and discuss how to be a person, even if this world is a world of love and harmony, this world is a world of justice, we should also study and discuss how to be a person. We can get along in this world. Mr. Fo, who used to write about the art of getting along in the attached publication, I think he was a misanthrope.</p>
<p>The first question in discussing how to be a person is whether it is better for us to be good people or bad people. I think it is better for us to be good people, because we ourselves do not like others to treat us badly, others to treat us with treachery, others to steal our things. We ourselves do not like to associate with people of bad character; we ourselves frown when we see people of bad character. Such people of bad character are everywhere not welcome. Confucius said, "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself," which is correct. Or some people say that being a bad person can take advantage of others. For example, when we trade with others, if we use heavy weights, we can take advantage of them. If we talk about morality and be good people, we will not be able to take advantage of others. I think this person is short-sighted! He doesn't know that if he always acts like this, perhaps before he even takes a step, everyone will break off relations with him, and it will be very difficult for him to stand in society. The advantage he gets is small and temporary, and the loss he suffers is great and long-lasting.</p>
<p>Now we discuss how to be a good person. We can get help from the books of Confucius and Mencius. Confucius and Mencius and other great Confucians were all great literary figures and masters of getting along in the world. An old gentleman said, "The Dao penetrates beyond the tangible universe, thoughts enter the changing forms of wind and clouds." How brilliant is his art of getting along in the world! This old gentleman is Mr. Cheng Hao. *The Travels of Lao Ts'an* and *Flowers in the Mirror* are considered good books by the world, and their authors both knew how to get along in the world.</p>
<p>Store Clerk Correspondence</p>
<p>Now I Know That Pickpockets are Not to Be Trifled With</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I know that you can answer all difficult questions, so I am writing with the utmost sincerity to ask you for a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>I am an apprentice at a cigarette and paper shop in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, and I have been at the shop for almost a year. Our shop is located at a public bus stop, so pickpockets have emerged accordingly. In the past month, there have been many cases of people crying without recourse in front of the shop. Five days ago, a pickpocket stole an umbrella from a regular customer of our shop (commonly known as an old customer); two days ago, a pickpocket stole a wallet from another regular customer, worth about twenty yuan. It is said that this twenty yuan was for a debt that was about to expire, and if it was not returned, he would be ridiculed and scolded, which was unbearable. I saw this; I saw that his actions were suspicious, so I watched him. Later, an honest and sincere villager approached, using his hat to cover his face, and used light surgery to pickpocket the bag. At this time, I shouted "Pickpocket!" The villager was alerted, and the pickpocket knew that things were not going well, so he glared and raised his arm to leave. There was more than one person besides me who saw this. However, they all held to the principle of "If people don't offend me, I won't offend them." Alas, the world is like this, what more can be said?</p>
<p>Afterwards, some friends praised me for my courage, some ridiculed me for being nosy, and some worried about me, fearing that I would be harmed by villains. Time passed like lightning, and the god of night descended. The next morning, someone told me: The light in your store has been smashed to smithereens. Then there was a lot of discussion, some saying that villains should not be confronted, and some saying that petty theft is not worth mentioning. But I felt greatly uneasy in my heart, because my words had brought disaster to the shop, how could I not feel guilty? From now on, I know that pickpockets are not to be trifled with. Our shop is located at a public bus stop, and business is very good. We get up at 5:00 every morning and go to bed at 12:00 at night. Before 12:00, there was no loud noise, but the next morning the door lamp was on the ground, which proves that the lamp fell sometime after 12:00 and before 5:00. At this time, everyone in the shop was asleep, but did the patrol police on the street not hear anything?</p>
<p>Sir, my rambling words have been too much. Now, to sum up, how should pickpockets be dealt with? I can't bear to stand by and watch people in danger, but if I do, it will cause more trouble, not only making enemies with individuals, but also harming the shop. I am writing this letter especially to ask for your advice. (Below Omitted) Tang TieZheng</p>
<p>Editor's Note: "People should do their best to help the government prevent the occurrence of criminal acts." The laws of all countries have such provisions. So if you see a pickpocket stealing someone's things, it is a crime in principle not to take measures to stop it. However, Chinese law, because the people who made this law were inevitably influenced by the traditional poison of "Sweep the snow in front of your own door, and don't care about the frost on other people's roofs," did not clearly stipulate this meaning. Especially the clever Shanghai people, they really understand the art of getting along in the world, "If people don't offend me, I won't offend them." Even if they see someone about to be beaten to death, they will just walk away. What is it worth to have a pickpocket steal something? It is already unacceptable for ordinary people to hold this attitude. What is most regrettable is that the police officers who are responsible for preventing petty theft are also self-important and dare not offend illegal pickpockets.</p>
<p>If things continue like this, I dare say that in the near future, Shanghai will definitely become a world of pickpockets! So we admire Mr. Tang's actions very much; as for harming the shop owner, that was an accident. Justice will prevail over evil, and these pickpockets will not be able to make things too difficult for you. Moreover, pickpockets often patronize your old customers, which is not good for business, so a little sacrifice is not worth worrying about. We also want to advise everyone to stand up and do this, so that pickpockets can be eliminated. At the same time, the police officers who are responsible for preventing petty theft must also earnestly take responsibility and not turn a blind eye. Finally, I hope that when the criminal law is revised, the example of other countries will be followed and it will be clearly stipulated that "The people should do their best to help the government prevent the occurrence of criminal acts."</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Sisters (6) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>"Look at the hair on your chest!"</p>
<p>That was spring. It was very warm. People took off their gray squirrel fur and put on pearl-embroidered robes, but during the day, they still couldn't help but sweat.</p>
<p>The gate of Miss Liu's house had been decorated with red and green cloth since yesterday. Tonight, in addition to a bright gas lamp hanging over the main gate, there were also two octagonal glass lanterns. However, these were common sights in Beijing and were not particularly grand, so many people who passed by her house thought that something festive was happening inside, but they did not feel that it was particularly spacious. In Wu Gui's opinion, it shouldn't just be decorated like this. Since her master was so rich, why not spend more money to make the entrance more lively? But according to the master, it was not appropriate to be too extravagant in Beijing, as it would not sound good if people talked about it. Of course, Wu Gui didn't quite understand this. But if you went into Miss Liu's room, it was very different. Many of the furniture was made of rosewood, and the chair backs were carved with hollowed-out flowers and inlaid with Jiangxi porcelain panels painted with ink landscapes. The bed, of course, was a spectacle, and the copper pillars that gleamed with gold would emit a clear sound with just a light tap of a finger.</p>
<p>In addition, the white walls were hung with red satin happy curtains, and there was more than just one. There were also horizontal screens and couplets.</p>
<p>This day and night were very lively. After the formal wedding banquet, there was also card playing, a total of four tables. Because everyone was smoking cigarettes, whether it was Three Cannons or Double Knives, thick smoke always filled the air, even causing Miss Liu to wipe away tears with a handkerchief. At this time, a person with small eyes joked:</p>
<p>"What? Why is Xiao Liu crying? Don't you like Master Zhang? Don't underestimate him. Now that the Hongxian Emperor is about to ascend the throne, Master Zhang and his wife's brother are very close. You'll see, he'll become a minister in the future."</p>
<p>Originally, Miss Liu was sitting on Master Zhang's lap, playing cards for him, seemingly very happy, but after this person's teasing, she couldn't help but stand up and walk away from his arms. In fact, everyone knew that she wasn't crying. The guests finally left, and the house had a strange, unpleasant odor that was unique to the people in the house. So she pushed open a window facing the street, and a burst of women's laughter immediately flowed in with the cool air. It was the prostitutes who had just finished their shift and were going back.</p>
<p>Master Zhang sent the person out the door, then ran back into the room, hugged her tightly, and kissed her frantically, as if saying:</p>
<p>"Now I've finally got you!"</p>
<p>"Look at the hair on your chest!" she said softly to Master Zhang.</p>
<p>"Hahahaha!" Master Zhang laughed wildly. The smell of alcohol was on her face.</p>
<p>It was already dawn.</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>How Did Films Really Begin? (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>Here is a more accurate answer!</p>
<p>There have been many different records about the origin of films. There are also conflicting opinions about who the original inventor of films was. Here is someone who, after various investigations, should indeed enjoy this honor. His name is William Friese-Greene, a photographer in London. His son, Claude Friese-Greene, recently worked for the British International Film Company and is now the most famous photographer in England. Below is what he wrote about the original state of film.</p>
<p>Although film has become a major part of people's lives in modern times, few people pay attention to how it began. If you ask any movie fan when film was invented, who the inventor was, or about the earliest sound films, you will surely get many bizarre answers. The inventor of film has been debated for many years. I can tell you that my father, William Friese-Greene, was the first to apply for and receive a patent for a motion picture camera. This was in June of 1889. He also went on to obtain a patent for making films, and he had unintentionally discovered the secret of moving pictures in 1885.</p>
<p>In 1880, my father conceived of the idea of combining Edison's phonograph with photography. From that time on, he spent years researching and trying to realize his ideal. In 1889, he even wrote to Edison about this plan, wanting to ask the American to cooperate with him in making sound films. Edison was clever and was of course very interested in this matter. He wrote back asking for the diagrams of the special camera to be sent to him, but there was no further communication after that.</p>
<p>My father had a deep interest in photography from a young age and was willing to study it. In 1882, he joined forces with John Arthur. Arthur had invented a projection lamp that could continuously capture scenes. My father's idea of moving pictures came from this lamp. He made various corrections to Arthur's invention. In 1885, he even held an exhibition at the British Photographic Society. Arthur died at this time, but my father continued his research.</p>
<p>For the next two years, he continued to work hard on research and improvement. He was a very famous photographer in London. Because of his reputation and credibility, when he held his "moving picture" exhibition in the laboratory, the audience was so crowded that the police had to intervene. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of The Battle of Emden</h3>
<p>— Shi Ming</p>
<p>The script still has some merit.</p>
<p>The performance is mediocre and lax.</p>
<p>"The Battle of Emden" (CIUISEREMDEN) was screened at Carlton, and about half of the audience was sailors from various countries. It was exported by a very famous German company, EMELKASTUOIO.</p>
<p>Although this is a work from three years ago, because it is a historical drama, there is nothing to criticize in its consciousness as being outdated or out of touch with the times. There is not much to talk about in the plot. It is only about the German warship "Emden" departing from Qingdao until it was destroyed and sunk by the British warship "Sydney." The first two parts slightly insert a love story, but it is minimal.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, it curses the evils and cruelty of war. The beginning is about soldiers leaving their wives and children to go to the front line, and it tries hard to write about the tragedy of separation and death. The interspersed love story is precisely to say that no matter what the environment, "love" is always selfish, and it frankly exposes the relationship between people. This film also fully describes the spirit of the German soldiers rushing into the flames and sacrificing themselves to save the ship. Of course, the German producers' propaganda of German courage and perseverance is very obvious.</p>
<p>Director Louis Ralph has greatly failed. With good historical materials, he can only tell a story plainly, and has no ability to dissolve it and turn it into a work of art. The segmentation of scenes is even more chaotic, making people dizzy, and sometimes it is not even clear whether this scene is of the Germans or the enemy [British]. The warship first has a big fire, then no fire, and finally it is completely burned, with a big loophole in the order.</p>
<p>The photography did use a lot of novel angles, but there is too little change. For example, there are more than ten shots of the sea "water," arranged in exactly the same way, making people feel very tired. There are too many small shots, so it is very trivial, and no scene has a delicate performance. The naval battle takes only long shots, which is very boring. The light is daylight, which is still clear. The sound is average. Too few people in China understand the German dialogue, which is also one of the reasons for the disappointment. As for the scenery, the interior and exterior scenes are both good, but the scene of "Emden" being destroyed is too obviously fake. The big fire scene can be said to be very tense.</p>
<p>A Tragic Epic Showcasing National Spirit</p>
<p>Produced by Youlian "Flower of Peace" starring Xu Qinfang</p>
<p>While "Emden" was in progress, three new-style destroyers appeared in the sea. These warships were completely from after 1925. They absolutely did not exist in 1914. This is also a big temporal oversight.</p>
<p>Using a map to show the "Emden's" journey is very clever, but according to actual reports, it destroyed as many as forty-two ships along the way. Now that the film has tried its best to be concise, and the map does not mention it at all, it is very inaccurate.</p>
<p>There is another advantage in this film, that is, the organization law of the navy. It seems that the director and actors have a lot of experience. But unfortunately, except for being destroyed, there is too little writing about the war.</p>
<p>The actors, each one mainly acts in combat, and the supporting roles and group work are still good.</p>
<h3>Review of "Female Zhuge Liang" ALADYS PROTESSION</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>If we only consider the translated title "Female Zhuge Liang," one would inevitably assume that this woman must possess "divine intelligence and brilliant strategies," with "the universe in her sleeves," naturally "devising strategies in the command tent, and winning battles a thousand miles away." However, after spending a dollar to watch it with rapt attention, this Mrs. Zhuge Liang did not impress us enough to make us admire her.</p>
<p>In reality, this is a "common" film from Paramount. If we must rack our brains to find some meaningful merit, then the author of this film lightly mocks the declining baron, gentlemen who treat alcohol as their second life (desperately stealing drinks during Prohibition), and despicable bootleggers, etc. However, this mockery is by no means a servant expressing dissatisfaction with the "ungentlemanly" behavior of his master, but rather a humble person kneeling at the master's "feet" saying: "Dear master, please work hard to honor your ancestors, the glory of the old master still needs you to carry it forward!" However, whether this kowtowing and bowing can "turn the tide" and "establish the family's foundation" is a big question.</p>
<p>The structure of the story can be considered self-consistent. The young man and woman falling in love at first sight is, of course, the most successful writing style of American films, and this film naturally has its share of it. But love words, hugs, and secret marriages, based on past experience, can indeed make money.</p>
<p>The director certainly worked very hard on this film. Look, he actually turned such a story into such a movie. In order to make well-fed people come to the cinema for entertainment, he made the ridiculous dialogues particularly loud. Action "gags" are, of course, even more necessary, so a dwarf carves fountain pens or STICKs with a small knife, and a horse's hoof crushes a gentleman's top hat ("this also has a bit of satirical meaning"), and they are filmed again and again, and again and again. These kinds of jokes are fundamentally very "laughable."</p>
<p>The "old-fashioned and arrogant" "old star" ALISON SKIPWORTH is certainly "old-fashioned" enough, and her performance is not bad. She is comparable to Marie Dressler, who starred in comedy films like "Female Politician," but she is not necessarily "arrogant." ROLAND YOUNG, who starred in "The Gay Divorcee," is still both funny and annoying here. GEORGE BARBIER, who plays the rich man, is quite thought-provoking. SARIMARITZA is indeed very beautiful, although her performance is not successful.</p>
<p>The sound quality is sometimes chaotic. The set design is passable... In short, this is a mediocre film.</p>
<p>George Brent's Dimming Eyesight Mei Cun</p>
<p>The news about George Brent's failing eyesight has been circulating in Hollywood for quite some time. They seem to feel very sorry for this Irish opera singer's misfortune, especially at a time when he is enjoying great fame in the film industry.</p>
<p>The only reason is said to be the effect of KLEIGLIGHTS, but on the other hand, it is also blamed on his excessive reading as a child without paying attention to the root cause planted. George came to the United States to pursue a life on the stage. Because he was the protagonist, he had to carefully read the scripts every week. As a result, the strong lights often fatigued his eyes' ability to adjust, leading to a state of stagnation. Moreover, during the day, he did not protect his eyes with sunglasses, so his eyesight deteriorated further.</p>
<p>When he realized the trouble with his eyesight, he wanted to take a period of rest, but as luck would have it, Warner Bros.' executives took a fancy to him at this time and begged him to join the film industry. Since he had long had this ambition for film, he naturally agreed and put the major matter of rest out of his mind. He repeatedly played opposite female leads such as Ruth Chatterton, Constance Bennett, Joan Blondell, and Loretta Young, and his reputation grew day by day.</p>
<p>However, his eye disease also worsened. After marrying Ruth Chatterton last year, she advised him to rest, but his interest in film and the praise he received continued to fascinate him. As a result, he only hired a doctor to be his consultant.</p>
<h3>"Cosmetic Market" Soon to be Released</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Because of the release of "Freedom Flower", Hu Die has gained even more audience admiration. Now, her second sound film after "Freedom Flower," "Cosmetic Market," which she also stars in, will soon be released.</p>
<p>In "Cosmetic Market," Ms. Hu Die plays a young woman from a semi-feudal family who, due to the pressure of circumstances, has to seek employment, and thus enters a department store as a female employee. However, once she enters society, many unexpected disputes surround her, even pushing her to the wall. Inside, there are descriptions of the female employees' jealousy and fighting, and the absurd and licentious pleasures of young masters and company supervisors, etc. The power of exposure can be said to be extremely strong.</p>
<p>Of course, out of a passion for supporting domestic films, the release of "Cosmetic Market" is something we should be happy about!</p>
<h3>Film Novel Secrets (SECRETS) (5)</h3>
<p>— Cairo</p>
<p>"Who else's cows are in your house?" Jack said, and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>"You are so hateful," Mary shouted resolutely, "My husband has worked so hard all this time, only to have you thieves rob him. You robbers, murderers!"</p>
<p>Jack listened, his eyes half-closed, and suddenly pulled out a sharp knife from his waist. He threw it forward, and it stuck into the wooden bed just inches away from little John's head. Mary cried out in alarm and quickly picked up little John. Jack said, "Next time you speak, be careful. And remember, my knife never misses." With that, they left.</p>
<p>Mary hugged her child and wept. John and Shen Xiang returned. They had already encountered Jack and his gang of robbers on the road, but because the odds were so uneven, and they were worried about Mary and the child's safety, they did not fight them but quietly let them pass. John returned home and discussed with Mary the plan to move to a better place. Mary still suspected that he was weak, willing to be chased away so easily by a gang of robbers. John wanted to tell her what kind of people these cattle thieves were and why they couldn't resist with force; but as his eyes wandered around, he saw the little wooden cow lying on the ground, crushed by leather boots; and at little John's bedside, stuck a sharp little knife. When he saw it, anger flooded his heart like a tide, and he could no longer hold it back. These hateful thieves not only stole his cattle, but also invaded his home! This was intolerable! He jumped up suddenly, grabbed his gun from the stool, and slung it over his shoulder. He said, "Mary, you are right. I can't be chased away so easily by a bunch of thieves. In this village, we can still find a dozen strong men to fight them to the death." He hugged her in his arms and said softly, "I may not be back tonight, but Shen Xiang will help you watch the house." He walked over, pulled out Jack's knife, stuck it in his belt, and strode to the door.</p>
<p>"Dear John, I love you," Mary called out softly behind him. As he walked out the door, she looked at her husband's back, her heart filled with infinite pain and pride. Then she closed the door and returned to her son's side.</p>
<p>John did not return for three days. During these three days, Mary felt shrouded in sorrow and darkness at home. Little John was very ill. Mary had no choice but to send Shen Xiang to the neighboring village to fetch Dr. McGoffin. Mary and Dr. McGoffin took turns caring for little John. Later, little John had a glimmer of hope for survival, and Mary felt much more at ease, but the doctor warned her: "Little John's heart is still very fragile, and he must not be frightened in the slightest, nor should he hear any loud noises. Otherwise..."</p>
