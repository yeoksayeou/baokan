<h3 id="c15">北美經濟復興計劃之實行 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 實</p>
<p>北美合衆國自九月一日起。將其三個月以來切實準備之經濟復興計劃。付賭實行。全國百分之八十之工商業。皆爲此新計劃之後援。竭全力以與當前之經濟恐慌相搏戰。蓋自一九二九年股票風潮開始。巿面頽廢。多財善賈之美國。在此恐慌狂潮動盪中。盡力支撑。結果匪特無救於一千二百餘萬之失業羣衆。即小有財產者。亦莫不感商業不振之痛苦。至本年三月金融恐慌爆發之。際新總統羅斯福雖强持鎭定。冀度難　。無如其國内經濟情况。與日俱壤。仍日趨於破敗之途。於是現總統乃不得不由政治上之惟一領袖。轉變而爲北美合衆國經濟上之獨裁者。英法兩國赴白宫談話之代表方在旅途中。而美國已宣告禁止現金輸。出大有實行通貨膨脹政策之趨勢。</p>
<p>當時美國一般人士。羣以爲假使貨幣對外價値低落。則物價勢必提高。。輸出暢旺。自在意中。殊不知此次經濟恐慌。已遍及於全世界。在主要各國中僅有程度輕重之别。决無根本上之差異。矧美國爲重工業國領袖。其生活水準。其製造工能。較東方諸國固已高出一階段。對西歐先進各國。亦另具新方式。且英日兩國。又於一九三一年放棄金本制度。美國之高級製造品。欲利用外匯低落之舊方法。以增加海外貿易。制服英日。挽回當前經濟上之頽勢。戞戞乎其難矣。故美國當局。又不能不準備和戰兩面政策。一方面力持其放棄金本位之故態。暫時不參與通貨安定之國際恊定。一方面努力於其國内巿場之振興。以人工刺激巿面。使一般產業界走向繁榮之路。惟此次美國之經濟復興計劃。除欲竭力避免資本主義的無政府生產外。其空前未有之特點。有如下述。</p>
<p>第一爲提高工資。蓋現制度之下。個人利益盛極一時。凡百經營莫不利於减少工資。增加工作時間。在恐慌期中。此種傾向尤爲顯著。乃美國此次復興計劃中。提高工資。竟爲實際中心工作之一。殆亦洞悉現勢。審察經濟結構而出者也。過去資本主義各國。對於克服經濟恐慌之企圖。維持產業界現狀。何一不竭力减少工資。以圖减低其生產費。然後再向巿塲競爭。如此行之數年。實騐結果。明白者已漸知非計。且蘇聯現狀。獨能超越恐慌者。亦豈有他故。要不外能以大衆爲基本。而實行其統制經濟政策已耳。設使一般大衆消費能力增高。則堆棧停貨。自必减少。生產過剩之弊。自必消除而經濟恐慌。亦自然减退也。然而美國此次之增加工資。尙爲空前未有之創舉。</p>
<p>第二。縮短工作時間。尤爲美國復興計劃中之一大特色。在過去先進諸國。各產業部門。中雖曾力行產業合理化。但亦絶不主張縮短工作時間。以免設備受損。而出產减少。致營業衰落也。不過肉體之精力。究竟有限。工作時間愈長。其精力愈不集中。成績亦愈不佳。倘若工作時間。能使之適可而止。則生產物品必愈佳良。工事之收效亦愈大。是以美國在其復興計劃中。毅然一反從前之所爲。縮短工作時間此外尙有一原因。即欲多吸收失業人員是也。</p>
<p>不過當世各國皆肆力於經濟的國家主義。對外奬勵輸出開拓海外巿塲。對内則倡用本國製品。以關稅及其他方法。阻遏外貨之輸入。主要各國。又皆努力於自給自足。設此計而完全實施者。又將何處尋求海外巿塲。國家主義。又何有發展之餘地。則重新分割現有巿塲。勢所難免矣。吾人處於列國環伺之下。經濟力在天產方面。固能自給自足。而環境實不能容許。其將何以自全耶。</p>

<p>記者因參與中國經濟學社第十屆年會、由海道往靑島、會畢後游濟南泰安、即乘津浦京滬兩路車回滬、此行聞見所及、有足述者、約記一二於後、</p>
<p>梁漱溟氏年來專心致力於山東鄕村建設運動、爲世人所熟知、此次經濟學社開會請其到會演說、演題爲「解决中國經濟問題之特殊困難、」其大意謂中國今後經濟上祗有兩條出路、㈠政府有力維持各地秩序治安、經濟方面則由人民自由競爭、自由發展、㈡政府除維持各地秩序治安之外、進一步興辦實業、實行統制經濟、此兩條路雖均係可走之路、然以中國目前之情形而論、外人之經濟勢力、業已深入内地、府若僅能維持治安秩序、則經濟上自由競爭之結果、將使外人之經濟勢力、日佔優勝、中國幼稚之農工業、將爲外力所壓倒、而不能免於破產之厄運、是以若走第一條路、前途殊爲危險、至於第二條路、自然較與今日中國之情形相合、然須要政府更健全、更有力而淸明、方足以語此、否則亦無異望梅止渴而已、今日中國之政治條件、實多不足、欲走第一條路、尙做不到、遑論更進一步、實施統制經濟、由此足徵在今日而欲求經濟上之出路、實有特殊之困難、究其困難之癥結、則在政治問題之末由解决、是以在今日談經濟問題、研究經濟計畫者、不可不注意於政治問題、且經濟問題之發生、各有其特殊之社會情形爲背景、故討論經濟計畫、除注意於政治問題外、又須深察社會各方面之個别性、必須如此、一切經濟計畫、方可出門合轍、否則雖有計畫、無異空中樓閣耳、</p>
<p>梁氏於演說後、曾與記者作一次私人談話、渠云、中國目下最苦惱者、厥爲無論個人團體、地方中央、均受環境束縛與壓迫在矛盾中討生活、以致一切力量、大都消耗於無用之地、此種情形若不改變、各人之生命力均無從充分發展、進一步、言、社會之進步、國家之演進、均賴各人生命之發揮、今吾國人不能充分發揮其固有之生命力、實爲凡百事業不易進步之一大原因、又中國之社會、係一農村經濟之社會、故一切建設事業、經濟計畫均須從農村方面着手、蓋中國問題之解决、端在農村問題之解决、乃梁氏深信不疑之見解也、涉論至農村問題、則魯省農村經濟情况、大足以供參考、茲更約略報告於讀者、</p>
<p>落花生爲魯省一種重要農產品、向來農家中有十畝或八畝土地、播種花生、一年之生計、便可高枕無憂、此項花生、運銷美國、以之製造花生油、銷售各地、今因世界經濟恐慌、百業凋敝、花生銷路亦大滯、價格較前低落一半、故凡播種花生之農家、均有瀕於破產之危險、此爲魯省農村經濟上之一大打擊、麥亦魯省之重要農產品、今美麥借欵告成、魯麥亦有滯銷之恐怖、聞因此之故、農民大都憂形於色也</p>

<p>贛省農業崩潰之槪觀</p>
<p>南昌特信、吾國以農立國、農民總數、佔全國總人口百分之七十八以上、而國民經濟、亦完全以農村經濟爲基礎、詎近年以來、外受國際資本主義之深入侵略、内而天災人禍之輪迴交迫、遂致農村經濟寖有根本崩潰之勢、從而社會上已起將起之軒然大波、無不以此爲動盪簸激之主力、此殆以農民在廣大之數量上及生產關係上、實已確立其在社會上極重要之位置故也、記者此次在贛省視察、歷時月半、經過縣份凡二十餘、中作農村調查者則半之、茲將江西全省出產槪况、略述如次、</p>
<p>據該省「國内農村改進事業考察團」報告、全省耕地面積、約四千萬畝、農户約三百萬户、平均每農户可得十三畝、重要農作物、年產米八千四百餘萬擔、木材約値八百萬元、茶葉二十餘萬箱、此外棉花薄荷樟腦茶油豆類等、因無詳細之調查統計、尙未悉其確數、工藝品如瓷器、年出產約値一千萬元、夏布約五百萬元、紙張約八百萬元、鑛產如贛南各縣之鎢·萍鄕餘干等縣之煤·永新九江等縣之鐵、均佔全省出產重要位置、鎢之產量、佔全國產量百分之八十、佔世界產額之半數、自民十六以後、出產日漸衰退、至二十年、全省出口貨、僅値一千七百萬兩、而同年進口貨竟値四千一百萬兩之鉅、夏布去年出產僅合平時三成左右、茶葉損失約在一百萬元以上、瓷器與民十六比較、出產减少四百餘萬元、紙張產額及銷路、更一落千丈、米谷則在前年水災時、更從滬上運入多量西貢米、麫粉供給、　全爲進口貨、生產力旣形激减、失業人數驟增、强者挺而走險、弱者轉乎溝壑、全省無匪縣份、只有南昌新建等二十餘縣、此外五十餘縣、大都遭受匪禍、受害較深者、竟至田園荒蕪、廬舍爲墟、此足見農村崩潰之一班也、</p>
<p>再進而一析安靖區與半匪區及匪區之個别現狀、㈠安靖區、表面上似可安居樂業、但骨子裏、則以受農產品低價售出、工業品高價購入、所謂剪刀形價格之大影響、結果、近五年來之各種農工、入不敷出、負擔日重、賠累愈多、不得不出與賣田產之一途、故有大多數自農農變爲佃農、佃農變爲雇農者、在此資本主義與前資本對立發展之下、前資本必日就於沒落、亦即小農經濟日即於必然的崩潰、而成土地愈集中、小農愈窮困之形勢、但農產價格低落、小農固吃大虧、而地主亦殊無進益、加以捐稅苛繁、主佃咸感得難償失之痛苦、間有逃亡他方荒蕪其田者、㈡半匪區、一因社會狀態之不安、二因農產價格之低落、富者懼亂、高飛遠颺、自農農及中小地主、雖欲避亂、但無法變賣田地、只好死守故土、大地主及雇農、則變動性較大、即易逃他方、自耕農百分數、遂相形而似增多、且因無人買田、土地不致集中、地主無法照管田地、爲收入聊勝於無計、只好改善租佃條件、勉以租田、而中小自耕農、爲欲彌補其副業崩潰之損失、亦甚願樂佃此項條件較優之田而耕之、但終以「耕未必得收、」「收未必可沽善價」之大問題、横亘腦際、往往减省肥料及勞力、而存任憑地力生產之心理、結果、產量反銳减、肥田變瘠田、小塊之荒田廢地、逐漸加多、同時農村金融、無形流出安定商業區、農民雖欲高利借貸、亦無人敢放欵矣、㈢匪區、凡軍匪戰爭區域、其破壞程度、誠有一片荒凉者、若游擊地帶、即非兵匪主力直接交鋒地、乃有小股匪軍、時整時零、出沒無常、無知農民、多被吸引、田地耕否無定、惟生命房產、均極危險、</p>
<p>江西省府、曾組織國内農村改進事業考察團、於去年十一月間、派遣王枕心等前赴蘇浙魯冀等省、考察農村改進事業、歷時數月、始行返贛、近王氏發起組織江西農村改進社、以期聯絡同志、實行到農村爲改進之設施、頃往訪王氏、對於各地農村改進事業考察感想、以及江西農村改進計劃、暢談頗久、據談、本人（王氏自稱）此次率領考察團同人、赴各省去考察農村改進事業、認爲各地農村事業、似各有其特殊性質、就中以認定敎育爲中心事業者較多、亦有對政治經濟各方面同時進行者、然因主觀見解之不同、有僅側重東方文化、而忽視時代背景者、有僅注意國内因素、而忘却國外經濟侵略者、但大體上對於農村事業、均能充分表現其熱心及犧牲精神、此乃所得最好印象、江西農村、實已瀕於整個崩潰之境地、本人考察歸來、對本省農村改進、略有見解、即㈠江西農村崩潰之情形與各地不同、而救濟方法、自不能完全模倣他處、㈡改進農村、應以農村經濟爲中心、而農村組織農村敎育等、亦應同時並進、換言之、即現欲將農民從匪區中拉回來、并預防未被匪患之縣份傳染起見、必須予農民以實際的利益、扶助其自立、確立農村經濟之基礎、然後其他一切事業、才能順利進行、而逹到改進農村經濟之手段、就是用政治力量、發展經濟、再因經濟的發展、普及敎育、推進政治、故目前擬先以試辦農村改進實騐區、進行各種實騐工作、以所得結果、普遍推廣云云、</p>

<p>苛捐雜稅民不聊生</p>
<p>在日人鐵蹄下之東北現狀、頗爲國人所急欲聞知、茲據前吉林省政府主席東北民衆救國軍總司令誠允特派員之書面報告、摘錄若干則如下、</p>
<h3 id="c99">烟賭公開 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>東北三省、處於日本鐵蹄之下、竟施行烟賭公開政策以弱我種族、所有商埠巨鎭、及大小縣城、均設鴉片專賣處、兼辦人民游藝賣票所、所謂游藝票即賭博票、就哈埠一處觀察、可見一斑、全哈爾濱由日本戒烟署發出鴉片零售處賣烟票、共三十六票、每票先繳押金五百元、所用烟土、均由日本戒烟署出售、每兩作價六元六角六分八厘、隨時派人抽查、不准由他處購買、又有三十六家零售處支出零賣所、一千三百餘家、其中以韓民爲最多、每家用女招待二三名不等、每人工資二元至三元、日銷土約七千兩左右、全哈發出賭票十張、每票先繳押金五百元、再由賭頭欵下、每百元抽二十元、自烟土公開後、已見乞丐滿街、搶案迭出、如功成玉鐵路局兩大搶案、開哈巿未有之先例、</p>
<h3 id="c100">强迫納稅 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>哈爾濱巿、除海關郵政以武力强迫接收外、航務鹽局稅捐、均被接管、各縣稅捐局、亦派日顧問一名、凡由海關進口之中國内地諸貨并地方土產、每百元加稅三十元、惟日貨僅納三元、哈埠當地出產之麵、每一大袋一百五十斤、貼印花票五角、每小袋貼印花一角、</p>

<p>僞國軍隊旅團、均加入日本顧問數名、除監視僞軍行動外、所有書報公文、均須經日人同意簽字、否則不准發出、各軍隊曾經日人一度改編、每營改爲三連制、每連定額八十名、再哈巿警察保安隊、遇有缺出、儘先以日韓人補充、現在哈巿警察中、已加入日警十分之二、</p>

<p>由朝鮮移來韓民數萬户、跟隨日軍、分布於哈爾濱以東各縣、此等韓民、每遇水田、即行强佔、初尙有由日人發給每十畝不足二十元之價欵、以後竟實行驅逐住户、强佔水田、並不給價、日軍又向民間搜羅自衛之槍、並勒令警團繳械、民心大憤、珠河延壽兩縣民團、擊斃韓民二百八十餘名、同時該民團中有二百五十名反正、投入抗日軍劉佐臣部隊、查日人移民耕種稻田、其用意首在接濟軍食、茲東北各軍到處破壞水田、不但軍食絶望、即移民之策、亦不能實行矣、</p>

<p>依天文台方面之說明、腿風中心、始終未經過上海、本埠昨晚風勢雖猛、然僅不過爲颶風之邊緣所波及耳、蓋此次颶風於二日下午、確曾直向上海而來、然於前晚四時、行抵北緯三十度及東經一百二十三度時、忽轉變方向、故該颶風未上岸、其中心亦未在上海經過、至前晚九時許、經過花島山北島之邉境、因之該處風勢之猛烈、竟逹十二個風力之巨、該處距上海僅六十餘英里、故是晚本埠亦有十個風力之狂風、迨昨晨六時、颶風已行抵北緯三十二度與東經百二十三度之處、該地距上海遠約在九十里左右、</p>

<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>丨全國女靑年會三全大會演說詞丨</p>
<p>各位代表，此次貴會到上海來開第三次全國代表大會，上海巿是覺得很榮幸的。兄弟忝長本巿·謹代表巿民表示熱誠之歡迎。大會各位代表是很普遍的由中國内地的農村中來的，當然在都巿的也不少：這種代表數量的統計，所表示的意義，就中以使我們預卜這次大會的成功。</p>
<p>各位代表，由内地到上海來，須認識上海是全中國一個經濟的重心；是全中國一個推動力量的所在，上海有三百十多萬的人口，在全世界爲第五個大口岸；不但在中國算是最大的商埠，就是在遠東也算是一個最大的商埠。現在上海在經濟方面，文化方面，與論方面，固已佔全國重要的地位；但是上海人口的增加，更屬驚人。在咸豐五年，就是七十多年以前，公共租界不過幾百人，全巿也不過祇有三四萬人，而今天有三百多萬。但是上海人口之增加與世界各國都巿人口增加的原因與條件不同，世界各國都巿人口的增加，是因他交通的便利，工業的發達，而上海人口的突增，並非工業之發達，乃由於中國二三十年來，連年戰事不休，社會不安，生產减少，生產工具不改良，農村經濟瀕於破產，有錢的人，就到上海來，托租界·作安樂窩；沒有錢的人，也紛紛到上海來謀生，這繼使上海人口增加到三百十萬，所以上海人口突增的現象，實在是我國農村經濟破產和我們老百姓生活不安的象徵丨這是何等危險何等可怕的一件事！各位代表，大多來自内地，所以我在今天歡迎各位代表的時候，略將上海一般的情形報告各位，同時，更願各位代表有時間能在上海作一次實地的考察。</p>
<p>各位代表遠自中國内地來此。中國内地固然沒有上海這様繁華，但是中國内地人情敦厚，風俗善良，决不是通商口岸所能冀及。所以各位代表，看到上海的繁華奢侈，千萬不要羡慕。要知道中國今天已到山窮水盡的地步，在這種情勢之下，我們國民不但不能急起補救，努力改善生產工具，增加生產，充實國力；且每况愈下，漏巵日增，照海關二十年度的報告：我們中國入超五萬萬四千萬；換言之，就是每年國貨與外貨的輸出輸入比較，我們還要拿五萬萬四千萬出去，國民膏血長此向外漏去，我們焉得不窮丨我們焉得不死！中國已患了嚴得的貧血症，血液日漸枯竭；就是沒有外患，沒有日人的武力侵略和壓迫，也可致於死命，這確是我國有史以來最危險的時期，所以今天中國唯一的要務，就是剛才主席所說的『救國』，然而救國工作應由男女共同負責，雖男子的救國工作和女子的救國工作或因地位之不同而互異；但其目的期則一。這次大會所定下的一個總標題是；『建造新社會』這個總標題，實令我們對各位代表表示十二分的敬意；因爲我們的救國工作，雖内各個人智識不同，能力不同，機會不同，環境不同，因而互異，不過只要全國同胞不論男女儘自己的智能做去，做一點，我們就得到一點成績，這才眞正有利於國家，有利於人民的。</p>
<p>但是我們在從事救國工作之前，還得立一志願；來復興我們的中華民族，中華民族有幾千年的歷史，對世界文明有很大貢獻，近代歐洲文明，雖遠過於我國，但是他們之所以有今天之文明，何嘗不是幾千年前中華民族的文明所啟發他們，所影響他們的。中華民族旣是世界上最大最文明最有貢獻的一個民族，但是到今天反落人後，民族精神也已如此頽廢不振，此中原因：完全是因爲近幾百年以來，我們民族自信力的消失；因爲民族自信力的消失，所以我們中國幾千年來，固有創造文化的能力，也莫由發揚，這是民族墮落不進最大的病根，所以我們要救國，先要作中華民族的復興運動，恢復中華民族的自信力；如果我們個個人都拿復興中華民族爲救國的基本工作，以勇往直前的精神，努力做去，我相信我們的國家一定可以救得，這次大會的總標題一建造新社會」，就是中華民族復興運動中的一個最重要而基本的工作，凡是每個中國人，都有這種偉大的抱負，我相信新社會的建造，一定能夠成功，我們的祖先，在幾千年前，做了不少偉大事業，我們現在雖比我們祖先受敎育的機會多，做事業的機會多；可是我們祖先做的事業，我們還是望塵莫及，實在慚愧萬分，現在全國人民都在那裏呼號救國；然而救國並不單是抗日，抗日固是救國工作中的一部份，救國工作眞是千頭萬緒，我們非得以我們的身體，我們所有的力量，貢獻於社會，貢獻於國家，救國工作就不能完成，婦女們所擔任的工作，雖和男子不同，而一般婦女，也覺得他們的救國工作沒有男子那様直接顯著，其實我以爲婦女的責任，比較男子更其重要；尤其是建造新社會的工作，更要婦女多負責任，因爲將來國家的主人翁以及將來新社會的中堅，全靠女子們的敎養。這次大會以建造新社會爲總標題，實在深得婦女運動的要旨，希望各位代表，領尋全國婦女向着這個目的邁進。</p>
<p>最後我還希望各位回各地去的時候，帶一個口信告訴各地同胞：要求上海巿名符其實的眞正繁榮，就先要復興農村經濟，都巿好像一條魚，内地農村好像水，如果水涸了，魚就無活命之理，現在各地農村經濟破產，好像沒有水一様，都巿的魚，也惟有死，上海現在雖這様繁華，但這是假的，我們要復興中華民族，要救國，就先要從復興各地農村經濟做起，以我們幾千年來固有的精神和文明做基礎，接受近代歐西文明，來建設新社會丨來建設新中國！今天以此意貢獻與各位代表，並祝各位代表與大會的成功。</p>

<p>— 思素</p>
<p>中國數千年以來的歷史，直可以說是一部完完全全的不澈底之歷史不論那一方面，都是不澈底。就像更換朝代，在歷史上算是最大的變革了；然而除了易姓之外，可有什麽澈底的變革呢？恐怕就只有易姓之際，對於前代子孫之謀殺盡絶爲最澈底了。六朝之宋齊梁陳，更是只有易姓和誅殺前皇室算是澈底變革，别的連表面上都沒有變革的形跡，前代的大官員，多數保持原禄位。而五代時的馮道，竟歷事唐晋漢周四朝十三君，官皆將相，還很得意的自號長樂老。宋元以後的幾朝變革，也只有廟堂之上更換另一班人，社會還是古老的社會，一些兒無變革。不幸辛亥革命，仍蹈覆轍，只是由滿人手裏把政權移到北洋軍閥之手，革命份子反而不旋踵間在祖國内站不住脚；社會依然如故，並且民不聊生，有每况愈下之嘆！這不澈底」之弊，看是有多麽厲害！</p>
<p>想不到我國的不澈底，租界上的外人也竟傳染着了！我們在馬路上行走，不是常遇着一輛黑汽車，車廂作長方形，竟大到和一間房子相似，前後門都是關緊着開駛嗎？那是專捉小癟三之用的汽車，上面有中西巡捕，巡行於各馬路間，看見有小癟三，就停下來捕捉，說是爲整飭巿容起見，但捉到捕房去，也不過關閉這麽兩三天，又放出來了。放出之後，也還是妨礙巿容，於是更捉，捉了再放。放了後又仍是捉，沒有了時。</p>
<p>其實這種不澈底，又豈僅租界外人；放眼看一看國際，像什麽會議，什麽恊定之類，何莫非不澈底呢？不過時代之輪，終於前進的；終於有這一天，會粉碎了「不澈底，」來一個澈底的大澈底。</p>
<h3 id="c203">飛機鐵甲車 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 蘭茜</p>
<p>提起這兩種又可怖又可恨的兇器，我們就會聯想到去年滬戰時的惶恐情形吧。頭上有軋軋作聲的飛機在盤旋，遠處有鐵甲車在進襲，這些都是敵人們派來的。就在這飛機與鐵甲車的恐怖之下，當時在上海的我們，眞嚇得亡魂喪膽了。</p>
<p>而現在南京却也大大的受着這同様的恐怖。（請閱者稍安無躁，靜靜聽我道來）據常到南京公幹的陳君談，南京現有的飛機與鐵甲車，其多也使你不能以數計，南京居民，不勝憂慮，因爲實在太多了，每一個人都要受着飛機與鐵甲車的進襲丨南京人以蚊比飛機，以鐵甲車比臭蟲。</p>
<p>這也算虧他們想得出，這兩種小動物實在眞像上述兩様兇器，飛機軋軋，蚊子嗡嗡，同様的在你頭上打迴旋，有機會時便要釘你一陣，（恰如飛機之下彈）使你好好的肉身上，現出一點一點的紅而癢的傷痕。（這就有如下彈後的地帶）蚊子釘了你一下，便滿意的飛去了。也和飛機一般作用。而蠢笨的鐵甲車呢，也恰像臭蟲一様。進展遲鈍，體形臃腫，但要弄殺它也不容易。水浸不死，餓不死，見肉就釘，使之凸起，且有毒，不易消除。</p>
<p>於此可見南京人對於蚊與臭蟲的恐怖之程度了。竟將它們比作這兩種兇器。說句笑話，倘使盡中國所有的蚊與臭蟲，使之化爲飛機與鐵甲車，則中國之强也，可指日而待，而大中華民國之權威，不但「賊邦」所深懾，抑且爲全世界之雄。因陳君以此相告，感慨系之，特爲之叙述如上。</p>
<h3 id="c204">優待囚犯 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>好像是在二年前吧，上海有一個白俄流浪者，因找不到麵包，於是異想天開，一拳擊破了某商店櫉窗上的大玻璃。判决拘役之後，他快活得甚麽似的，因爲可以無代價得到暫時的衣食住。他說，期滿出獄之後，還要用這方法，解决生活問題，雖然下回未見分解，可是「吃官司」是謀生之一法，確是再也穩妥不過的。</p>
<p>我們見到這些年，各地監獄，像上海的大飯店一様，時常掛着「客滿」牌。我起初還以爲公安人員辦事認眞，破案神奇，所以囚犯這麽多。可是仔細一想，不對，這些囚徒之内，必有無數「騙飯吃朋友」寄跡其間。國家每年花了這大的囚糧，却去供給這些不在三十六行之内，而以吃官司爲臨時職業的馬浪蕩們，眞寃。</p>
<p>前幾天有人控告某監獄尅扣囚糧，我就手心裏揑了一把汗，因爲一旦不尅扣了囚糧，囚犯有得裝飽了肚子，監獄雖然不是好去處，沒飯吃的朋友，將不跑施粥廠，而把監獄視作收容所了，那還了得。</p>
<p>這幾天，更不得了，聽說，囚犯們經了一個相當時期，得國家解放性愁一次。還有一個風聲，說將嚴厲的取締刑訊。若成爲事實，那麽，進門時，當然「巴掌」也不打了，莫說打屁股，上電刑。入獄之後，有裝得飽肚子的囚糧吃，不憂涷餒。旣飽且暖，還可回家性交，比了離鄕背井，而不能得一飽的，豈不是强。</p>
<p>若是優待囚犯，一旦實行，「騙飯吃朋友」，勢必賓至如歸，我不知當局，有沒有萬間廣厦，使他們各得其所。萬一來不及趕築監獄去容納他們的話，那麽，我以爲不妨考試一下，及格的，才許入獄享受衣食住，以示限制，倒也可行。</p>

<p>本年夏初，在下偶得一項特殊收入，據内子原意　是存入銀行以備不虞，愚意以其呆呆的，放在銀行裏，莫若置備一様實用品。明輩來往，藉　裝裝體面，兼且可使幾個熟朋友見之弄得莫明其妙。而起敬羡之心。結果，是買了一架應時的華生檯扇。某日，舍親曾經留學英國的夫人枉顧在下，於寒暄之後，首先開啓電扇，以示優待。不料某夫人睨笑阻之，在下惶恐殺電，内子疑而問曰：「某師母勿熱麽？」夫人傲然答曰：「我坐汽車來，太陽晒勿着，這種中國貨電扇走得怪響，實在聽勿慣，我是一向用丨愛姆生丨的。」</p>

<p>㈠賽燈的玩意　　十年前，在幼小的時代，總時常歡喜跟許多年齡相彷彿的小朋友們玩耍！玩耍的方法，爲了時令的不同，所以方法也有不同！</p>
<p>做瓜燈的玩意，因爲天氣很熱，夏夜常愛跟許多姊姊妹妹哥哥弟弟講故事；所以，不大白相；到得天氣凉一點，就一同的，和許多小朋友，做了許多的瓜燈，在夜神光臨的時候，出去約羣結隊的跑來跑去賽燈！</p>
<p>許多小朋友的手裏，都是拿了瓜燈，前前後後，排得很整齊的，非常好看！有時候，大家就一面走，一面唱着歌；團結的精神，是在這個地方，可以表示出來，誰說中國人像一盤散沙？</p>
<p>㈡瓜燈的做法</p>
<p>無論是大的西瓜，或是小的金瓜；最好的，是一種上海呌做浜瓜，鄕下呌做洋西瓜的，來做瓜燈！</p>
<p>白天，當吃西瓜的時候，不要把一隻西瓜，剖開兩面；自然啊！要做瓜燈，必定要使得一隻西瓜殻，像一盞美麗的燈兒一様；所以，當白天吃西瓜的時候，祇要把一隻西瓜，在那西瓜花朶脫去的一頭，稍微剖去像一隻小盆子様的一部分，然後，再把裡邊的心子，用調羹拿出來，吃掉；把不好吃的内皮，刮得薄薄的變成像一隻燈殻，這裏，第一步的手續，就做好了！第二步，就是用兩根闊薄的小竹片，做成十字形的，架在瓜的當中，不過在兩根竹片相交的地方，是要用一根不細不粗的針線，來做一個插蠟燭的尖頭！</p>
<p>其次，就是在剖去調羹様的一塊以後，在那邊緣，要平均的攢四個洞，這就是要縛了四根細麻線，吊在小竹桿上提携的！</p>
<p>最後，是在瓜燈内點上了蠟燭，手裡提了這燈，就可以跑來跑去的玩了！</p>
<p>考究一點的，是在瓜燈的四周，刻上許多字畫，像一個雙喜，或是福禄壽三字，或天下爲公四字，或其他的字，或其他的畫景等等！</p>
<p>假使在燈上，再刻上抗日救國的字畫，那末，更富有愛國的思想了！</p>

<p>— 葉頥</p>
<p>夏秋之交的時候，楊樹或南瓜葉的下面，一到了夜晚，就有許多的紡織娘，織織織的呌着；有許多人家裡沒有園地的，那末，就可以到外面去捉幾隻紡織娘，來養在家裡；但是，養在什麽地方呢？下面，就是幾種養的方法：</p>
<p>一，竹的籠　就是用細竹絲做成的；他的形狀和質地，是和普通的鳥籠一様，不過，小一點吧了！這種，買也有得買，做也很便當。祇要用十二根粗一點的小竹棒，大槪二寸長，四角方方的架起來，再在竹棒上鑽了許多小洞，把許多細竹絲，插成功！不過做起來麻煩一點</p>
<p>二，鉛絲籠　是用許多細鉛絲，編織成的，祇要有一個紡織娘能進去的地方，就可以養起來了！</p>
<p>三，葉絲籠　是用大的竹葉，編織成的，方法和鉛絲籠的做法一様！祇要把許多竹的細絲，縱横織起來，一共做六面，然後再用細線，縫起來，開一個小門，就得啦！</p>
<p>四，瓜的殻　用一個小瓜的殻，把頭上切去了一點，再把裡面的心子挖去，薄薄地，在殻上再攢幾個小洞，便成一個紡織娘的金絲籠！</p>
<p>不過，籠子做好了，把什麽東西給紡織娘吃呢？那就是在早上去採幾朶南瓜花，和小毛豆（黄豆）給它吃，就可以了！</p>

<h3 id="c209">農村崩潰中的水災問題 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 宗藩</p>
<p>人類的所以生存，是不斷地與自然爭鬥的結果。農業全是自然的產物，因之與自然的關係更深，與自然的奮鬥便也格外密接了。</p>
<p>中國是一個五千年來農業立國的國家，土地膏腴，物產豐富，這不但是我們向來以此自豪；並且我們的整個民族，依賴這賜予才能豐衣足食，才得優游佚樂。但是土地何以會這様膏腴？物產何以能如此豐富？這得之於天者有限；卽由我們的先人的努力奮鬥，却占最大的最重要的部分。我們翻開任何時代的歷史，與考察任何地方的產業，凡是堤岸溝渠大至河川的興修，農懇的開拓，無不經過幾十年乃至幾百年的辛苦經營，才能有相當的收穫，否則洪荒一片，都是些不毛之地而已！</p>
<p>然而現在，中國整個的農業是崩潰了。不但所有的農民，都在半死的饑餓綫上，甚至我們要穿的衣服的原料，如棉花棉紗等，每年從外國輸人者達二三萬萬兩；我們天天所必需的食料米麥麵粉等，每年輸入的也達二三萬萬兩。而且這輸入品，是經常的長期的一年增加一年的輸入進來。由農業的崩潰，而使外國入口貨物作急劇的增加，因這輸入品的襲來，而使中國的農業更無法爲之復興！循環往復，非至整個的中華民族覆亡不止！</p>
<p>中國的農村所以崩潰，外國的衣食的必需品的所以大量輸入，這原因自然是很複雜，但是中國的政府不能興修水利，中國的農民，被層層剥削得無力去恢復或抵禦水旱等天然的災害，這可以說是最重要的原因。而且也可以說：從中國到處所流行的水災的年年加重，也就可以來測定中國農業崩潰加深的程度。</p>
<p>民國二十年長江沿岸的大水災，渡及者凡十六省，僅就皖·湘·鄂·贛·江·浙·豫七省較重的災害的損失，據水災救濟委員會的調查，確罹水災而提出報告的被災面積，佔總面積的三二·五％；被淹田畝達一二七，七○六，四五二畝；財產損失估計一，五七五，三三○，三六○元；被災人口數爲四三，三○○，八四九，占上列各縣總人口的二五·九％。（以上統計均據一九三三年申報年鑑頁Ｐ七○丨七一）這次的大水災，無損失之重，當然可說是空前的了，不但影響於全國的國計民生，就是日本帝國主義的發生東北事件，也直接間接把這大水災做一個預兆或導火線的。至於去年，據調查是最近五年來災害較輕的一年；但吉林·黑龍江·山西·雲南·等省的水災，陜西的水旱風雹黑霜各災，河北的各河决口，江西的先水後旱，災害亦達七省之多，而且因爲受了前一年大水災的影響，產米各省遇到了豐收反而糓價大賤，農民所受的苦痛，却較災害的一年更是厲害！</p>
<p>至於今年，幸而六七月間長江的危險免强地過去了；然而最近因黄河的决口，豫·魯·冀·陜·蘇·皖等各省被災的達百餘縣；（八·三十日晨報）豫省滑縣的河堤决口，淹滅六千餘方里，計六百餘村；（九月一日申報）湘省濃縣·常德·零陵·華容等縣水災淹田三四十萬畝（七月二十二晨報）其他在這兩月來，單是報上的記載，幾於無日無之，約計受災省紛已達十六省，災民達一萬萬人（八月十七時事新報）損失數量，雖然不至如民國二十年之鉅大，但决不在少數的了！</p>
<p>馬羅立氏（Ｍａｌｌｏｒｙ）說：中國在紀元前一○八年與紀元後一九一一年之間，曾有過一八二八次的災荒。換句話說：每一年中國的十八省内，總有一省曾鬧過災荒的。如果我們把他這統計來和現在的狀况相比較，災荒擴大的情狀，相差已不知有了多少？而且他所舉的例，是把中國的一切水·旱·兵·匪·風霜病虫等災害，都總括在内的。竺可楨氏在他所著的中國有史以來之氣候變化一文中，發表自唐初至二十世紀初葉每隔一百年間所發生的水災旱災的統計中，特别是水災，以元淸兩代爲最多；但這比較近年來，自然不可同日而語，而我們却可以在這裏知道政治與災害的關係的明顯了。</p>
<p>民國以來，災荒更頻繁更廣泛地在逕行，一九一三年的淮河汎濫，在安徽淹滅一○，四七○方哩，江蘇淹二，三○○方哩；一九二四年的江西大水，贛州附近幾百方哩的良田，盡變澤國；黄河沿岸，一九二五年淹滅地面八○，○○○方哩；一九二七年長江下游各省被水災者更達數萬方哩，這些悲慘的故事，都在我們最新的記億中。在這災荒的中國，一九三一鬼，必然地將更擴大的要產生出來，一九三一年的大水災雖然過去了，一九三三年的災變，正在襲來。而今後的災變，祇有一幕幕地愈演愈緊；如陣痛的週期律將愈來愈短！中國幾千年艱難締造的農業，不數年必被破壞無遺，中華整個的民族，也必然地隨了這水災而完全崩潰了！</p>
<p>這水災的襲來，我們已說過，是中國農村崩潰的表現；而農村的崩潰，也就是釀成這水災的原因。所以我們如果要救我們自己的民族，必須先來復興中國的農村，同時必須來興復水利，以及與水利有關係的工事。總結一句話：就是我們要圖生存，我們應該要與自然去鬥爭；至於與自然去鬥爭以前，必須具備的若干條項，自然是應該積極準備，這當然不在話下了。</p>
<h3 id="c210">水利與水災 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 何冰</p>
<p>㈠水利經濟的作用</p>
<p>瓦爾加以爲中國如沒有水利，卽沒有農業。馬加研究中國農村經濟，亦着重在水利經濟的作用。中國本部各省，自然環境的分佈，約可分爲兩大區域，卽黄土區與水田區。黄土蔓佈於河北·山西·陜西·北部，甘肅以及山東，河南的北部與南部幾縣，這些區域，是中國歷史上的寳藏。黄土是一種經過河流浸淹，積久沈澱的土壤，能夠吸收雨的水份。這種水份，在最深的地方；遇到了土壤中最下層而富於營養物質的濕氣，經過微細管作用，就上升到地面上來，而且帶着一切地底下的營養物質到地面上來，所以黄土本身能够施肥料，土壤常是非常肥沃。但是，黄土的這些美點，必須要有充分的水量，才能表現出來，如沒有充分的水，地面上和地底下所發生的微細管作用就停頓，植物就得不到營養成份，珍貴的黄土，卽變爲一片赤地。</p>
<p>南部水田區域，對於水的需要自然更甚。水田區域的主要植物是米。米的特性，如科布蘭敎授所說：「米與其他植物一様需要滋養與呼吸，如要促進這種生活，必需過程的實現，一定要有水份。……如果那些地方水景供給很完備，那麽米的生長就不用雨了。但除了水量不足外，米有時還要受到水份過多的損害。……」所以，在中國，水利經濟無疑的是决定農業盛衰的因子，一方面需要水，他方面却防免水的過多。</p>
<p>在中國，水利經濟差不多和農業同時發生。春秋以後，灌漑方法已逐漸普及，史記河渠書載：「西門豹引漳水灌鄴，以富魏之河内。」這不是沒有原因的。如秦的富强，卽由於鄭國渠的開闢。</p>
<p>今日中國農產物，地價等豐衰高下，由水利决定的很多。在陜西的渭北低原區，「據說，從前奏開鄭國渠，化斥鹵爲膏沃，關中從此沒有凶年。後來各代相繼，水利有興替，地力物產卽有盛衰」。（據「中國農村經濟質料」所引，七六三頁。）綏遠省的大部份，「農作物的生長，幾乎完全倚靠着河渠的灌漑。因爲灌漑，可以增加收成，且能保障必有收穫，所以地價亦大有不同？」（同上，一一四九頁。）</p>
<p>㈡幸福的水</p>
<p>在水利經濟决定農業生產大部份的關係中，水對於一般農民，自然是可祝福的了。農民對於水的珍視，常有出人意料之外的。如在四川，有許多大好水田，祇耕作一季，冬季任其閑置，其原因便是缺水。如董時進氏考察所得說：「四川稻榖收穫之後，如將水放洩，播種旱作，則來年春季恐田中缺水，不能插秧，其損失必大，故不能不自秋季起，預行貯水，此實農民不敢在冬季行旱作之最大原因。」（同上八二一頁。）</p>
<p>水旣是這様可珍貴，爲水而起的鬥爭自不可免。如湖南省，如「今歲旱災，農民因爭水鬥毆，甚至構訟者，時的所聞。……輪水時間，無一定之標準，强有力者，往往取之過多。」（同上，一一一三頁。）在山西，分水制度很可觀，水流經過那一村，這水卽歸那村所公有。「其用水之法，均按村按期規定，有以十日爲一期，或半月爲一期，……趙城榆次兩縣風俗較爲强悍，往往下流各村與上流各村爭水鬥毆，時有命案發生」（同上七五五頁。）爭水及防水風潮，各地部有。如去年六月大晚報及七月五日時事新報所載，江蘇蕭縣與安徽宿縣農民，爲爭水竟至發生二三千人的械鬥。本年七月十一日晨報新夜報，對於山西省的爭水風潮，有如下的記載：</p>
<p>「南洪洞趙城等縣村民，歷年每値夏季，互相爭水灌田，時起糾紛，發生格鬥情事，雙方村民，死於木器鐵器槍械之下者，爲數頗衆。……本年自立夏以來，各縣苦旱，以致淸源縣北營平泉兩村居民，於上月（六月）六七兩日，因爭水灌地，頓起猛烈格鬥，平泉村以人多勢衆，用來復槍將北營村村民擊斃一人，受輕重傷者十七人一云云。</p>
<p>㈢水利建設</p>
<p>雖則中國農民對於水的需要是這様急切，但是對於大規模的灌漑系統，　别的小農是無能爲力的。水利建設是社會的事業，耕灌數畝以至於數十畝的土地的農民，不但沒有能力，而且也不能自己建築一個水利系統。於是，水利建設遂祇有期待於中央及地方政府了。</p>
<p>中國歷史上，所謂良善的中央政府或地方上的循吏，其重要的責任之一便是建設水利。也惟有建設水利，方能獲得人民的擁護。在漢朝的時候「邵父杜母」至今稱爲美談，如後漢書載：</p>
<p>「元帝建昭中，邵信臣爲南陽太守，於攘縣之南六十里，造鉗廬陂……用廣灌漑，歲歲增多，至三萬頃，人得其利，及後漢杜詩爲太守，復修其業，時歌之曰：前有邵父，後有杜母。」</p>
<p>農民崇拜水利建設者的風氣，至今猶存。白朗敎授考察四川農村，很驚奇地說：一此種大灌漑制度之創設者，農人敬之如神，用尊嚴的機式以奉祀。對於供給水之則例，亦變成該地人民之一大部宗敎的儀式，每年淸圳一次」。（「資料」八五九頁。）</p>
<p>因水利經濟對於農業的重要，因之歷代政府莫不特别重視，且均設有專官，以司其事，對於地方長官，有功於水利建設者，施特獎。中國民族生長之速，可說和水利建設合正比例。在以前，西人到中國，見我國水利建設之偉大，莫不將嘆不已。如李淑芬，卽看到中國灌漑設施之便利與有條例，曾嘆爲人類的奇蹟而紀載着。如原先黄河的堤防，長江及珠江上下游的水綱，都是世界各國所少見的農事設備。</p>
<p>㈣「水禍」</p>
<p>農業對於水的關係是兩方面的，一方面需要水的灌漑，他方面却也要防免水的侵害。因之水利建設有二方面的意義，一方面是普及灌漑系統，别方面是預防洪水的侵害。換句話說，在適當的程度内水是可祝福的「幸福的水」，但在不適當的時候，却也可成爲可咀咒的「禍水」了。</p>
<p>水利的建設旣非個别的農民所能勝任，自必惟有依賴政府。於是政治的淸明與否，與水利的建設，成爲正比例，政治的變動卽可影響於水利的變動。歐陽修在唐書地理志中記載溝洫的開通與政治的關係說：</p>
<p>「大抵在天寳以前者居什之七。豈非太平之世，吏治修而民隱達，故常以百里之官，而創千年之利。至於河朔用兵之後，則以催科爲急，而農功水道，有不暇講求者歟？」</p>
<p>摩列在「尼羅河與埃及文明」一書中，引拿破崙的話也說：如果國家行政好，則河渠修治，河潮規律公正執行，灌漑所及者衆；如果行政不好，腐化，軟弱，則河渠淤廢，隄防不修，不但不得其利，且將汜濫開來，爲害無窮了。</p>
<p>今日中國水災之頻仍，有由來矣。</p>
<p>第一，入民國後，不能說沒有治水的專官，但等於虚設。積極方面旣不能普及灌漑系統，消極方面也不能興隄防水。水利經費雖略有，而其結果不過是造成些貪汚史實。十九年的長江水災成因且不說，今日黄河决口聲中，也有這様的新聞：丨丨</p>
<p>「本年八月二十八日申報載：「鄂省堤欵，數年未加淸理，侵蝕挪借，視爲故常，前歲水災發生，此項秘幕，遂完全揭露……積久玩生，而侵蝕虧挪之案，遂層見迭出。除長岳關監督毛鐘才…侵虧堤欵，逃逸無踪…其次…等案，虧數較多，各縣縣長，財政局局長，各征收局長，虧欠或挪移捐欵者，多或逾萬……」</p>
<p>第二，建設旣不能，而破壞則有餘。對於水利的破壞，最有力的是戰爭，而戰爭，近年來的中國，又是無年無之的，戰爭中無意的破壞且不說，而以水爲攻守之具的也很多。本年五月二十三日時事新報載：丨丨</p>
<p>「劉文輝部十七日佔崇寗，黄隱部退集灌縣，决堰死守，沿江十餘縣泛濫成災，禾稼淹沒，農事堪虞。</p>
<p>「劉文輝十九日二次下令總攻鄧軍，灌縣金馬城靑杠樹戰事均烈，劉强渡未逞，令將江鄧堰掘毁，减少毘河水勢，但外河水漲，沿河各縣均受水……」</p>
<p>第三，不但如此，有的時候，甚且「救災」都是不可能的。本年八月二十八日申報載有一個可注目的消息，卽魯西十八縣災民通電中云：丨丨</p>
<p>「……自河北長堤决口，深虞水患入魯，人心洶懼，一日數驚，但决堤出於土匪，國法非所顧忌，聞之激奮，無可奈何。乃竟無獨有偶，愈出愈奇，河南省政府公然派兵一旅至蘭對，决堤下灌，蘭對河堤，卽於是夜决口，洪水横流，灌注魯西……十數縣及漕寗一帶……」</p>
<p>這都不是偶然的或例外的「例子」，可是普遍的現象？</p>
<h3 id="c211">公路與水利 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 端生</p>
<p>「與其多築公路何如多修水利」，近來頗有一部分人之論調，如是；揣其意，殆亦有鑒於興修水利之切要也。愚以爲吾國路政不修，由來已久，交通不靈，運輸不便，文化工商，同受其累；尤以戰術進步，軍械日精，一切重砲輜重，及進攻車輛，均賴有廣大直捷之道路，方足以資運用，則公路之修築，從國防及綏靖工作着想　固不容緩也。然爲興修水利之論者亦有其見解，非爲最近長江水漲黄河泛濫而發，亦非反對公路之修築，蓋其所言，頗從現在之國計民生着想也。其言曰</p>
<p>㈠從農業及民食着想</p>
<p>農業所希望者，爲雨暘時若，則發育順利而豐收可操劵；絶不然，亦望其水旱有調節之方，收穫方不致歉折。夫雨暘時若，出於天而非人力所可控制。至水旱之來，固由於天，然如人力得宜，亦未始不能補救。蓋惟興修水利開濬河渠，　則洪水無慮其泛濫，霖雨不患其停瀦，旱亦不慮其涸竭。吾國以水利之不修，洪水之來，則河渠不能容，而泛濫爲患；霪雨稍久，則積水不能消，而沉淹足虞，旱則更無論矣，土龜地坼，無水以灌田，坐令禾稻枯槁以死。「水則易潦，旱則易災」，此吾中國農業所受最深切之苦痛，亦即民食常虞不給之由來也。故今日中國而欲復興農村，解决民食問題，其急迫需要，亦無逾於修水利。蓋興修水利，旣便交通，又利農業，農業興則農民裕，農民裕則社會安，國基固，民食問題，亦隨之解决矣。</p>
<p>且今之築公路，尙有破壞農村之可能。爲國建築之便利，路線所經，斷河塞港，截地割田，若果善爲處理，或多築涵洞杠樑，農田仍可資其灌漑，乃爲省費起見，毫不顧農田水利。至已圈用之地，明言給價，而地價則遷延不付，屢索無着。甚至並已徵用之土地，亦不爲蠲除田賦，農民尙須負担照常納稅之義務。此固承辦人員之不善，無預於公路之本身，然以此埋怨於民，民雖不敢言，何如稍分建築公路之財力，以興水利，農民之歌功謳德，寗止堯天舜地也。</p>
<p>㈡從農工商業之需要着想</p>
<p>一般以爲公路告成，沿綫各地之交通便，運輸靈，往來捷，則工商業興，農業發達，而實際則不能如一般人之所預期。（一）即從農業以言，上海附近，固屬馬路縱横，農產宜多用車輛輸送矣，而殊不然，則公路所經，皆爲鄕村僻鎭，利用之者，自必更少也。（二）從工商業着想，利用公路，除乘坐外，亦無異於農民。不觀現在已成之公路有辦貨運者否，有則其業務如何？以及沿線各鎭工商業有無利用車輛，尤其是汽車，以爲運輸者否？此其言，雖有偏重南方而爲立論，然如北方，素用車馬，至以汽車供運輸，更無此財力。夫旣南北均如此，則公路之效用，除有關於軍事交通，政洽聯絡，自當别論，此外徒供少數人「極娛遊於暇日」或較有資財者之往來利便而又。</p>
<p>㈢從杜塞漏巵上着想</p>
<p>年來土貨出口，日見衰微，進口洋貨則不論其爲窮鄕僻壤，無遠弗屆。一年一年入超金額增進不息，農村破產，民生艱窘，是乃當然之果也。而公路之修築，　正爲洋貨作推銷。此其言驟聆之，或以爲過作危詞，聳人聽聞。按其實則自築路用具起，以至於汽車，即小至一羅絲帽一羅絲釘，大至於汽缸機械，以及發電之電池，輪軸之車胎，裝修之板木油漆，漆布玻璃，無一非洋貨，則多造一條公路，多備幾輛汽車，外國廠多一筆生意，居間洋行多一副佣金，此無怪外國人口口聲聲稱許中國人造公路，爲文明進步也。而最大之漏巵，當爲汽油，車無油即不行，油經一度使用即爲烏有，積日計時，消費之量可驚。觀於英美俄油之跌價競銷，正見油之前途大有可觀，其爭奪乃至劇烈。人人雖跌價；我蒙一時之利，而終爲無窮之害。若興修水利，開河濬渠，擊檝行舟，欵乃一聲，似若紆緩，但無絲毫權利　溢；即行駛汽船，亦無如汽車幾無一　非洋貨者可比。故興公路行汽車　其至大無窮之損失，爲其材料車輛汽油皮胎，皆仰給舶來，則公路建築愈多，漏巵愈大，以今日之國計民生，節用洋貨，多用國貨，尙不遑補救，奈何爲造公路而不計及損害耶？</p>
<p>㈣從公路之使用上着想</p>
<p>近來之公路，爲省費，爲急就，粗製濫造，崎嶇不平，車輛行動，顛簸不堪，故車輛易於損壞，饕路亦需費浩大，且僅能供乘客之用，而不能爲運貨之計，故與農工商業爲益甚微。若如北方向用車馬，闢修公路，尙屬因勢乘便之圖；南方則港汉紛歧，向惟舟檝往來，而亦多修公路，漠視水利，利害相權，何待計較。</p>
<p>上爲主張多築公路何如多修水利之說者也。愚以爲隨時勢之進步公路興修，無所用其疑慮。惟是國難匪災，交逼而至，農村破產，室如懸磬，民窮財盡，至於此極，自以培養民生爲急；凡可保存國家一分元氣少增一分漏巵者應謁力籌維以促其實現。一切建設，從多數人民有無需要，衡其緩急，及社會現狀世界潮流之如何以爲斷。若公路若汽車，固爲交通之利器，且爲歐美習行習見之物，提倡公路，正爲接受西洋文明，改善中國路政，發達農工商業，無可加以非難。然不念中國之產業風俗人情以及一切的一切，現在能否一如歐美？如曰不然，吾人固應迎着潮流做去，亦應顧及社會情形。至必欲多築公路。以爲建設之基，亦應從車輛，材料汽油等等之自製自給方面進行，否則，公路縱横，密如蛛網，亦正滾滾金錢，紛向南洋歐美綑載以去之日也。</p>

<p>— 和</p>
<p>在高唱入雲的「農村復興運動」當兒，五千萬美金的棉麥大借欵之一部份正將撥作復興農村之用的時候，黄河之水天上來，滔滔地自冀·豫·魯·蘇·奔騰而下，其聲勢之盛不下於民國二十年的長江大水。輾轉於洪水之中的災民，已有三百萬！這數目，超過了構成中國勞工問題的產業勞動者人數的一倍。</p>
<p>今年可說是「多難災邦」的了；在六月開始，長江之水卽告狂張，且曾一度冲上了岸，漢口一帶，平地水高數尺，幸而沒有和十九年一様，繼續上漲，但其危險，實已間不容髮。同時，山西各縣，也告水災，陜西各縣，「鼠大於貓，」江蘇徐海各屬」蝗蟟過境，」綜合起來，黄河决口，被災的各縣還沒有計算在内，已有下列被災的地方；</p>
<p>（一）湖南省　　水災旱災</p>
<p>（二）河南省　　水、旱、雹、霜、風、蝗等災</p>
<p>（三）陜西省　　旱、霜、風、雹、冰、疫等災</p>
<p>（四）湖北省　　水災、旱災，</p>
<p>（五）安徽省　　風、水、雹災</p>
<p>（六）甘肅省　　旱、疫、地震</p>
<p>（七）浙江省　　水災</p>
<p>（八）江西省　　水災</p>
<p>（九）河北省　　水災</p>
<p>（十）貴州省　　旱、雹、水災</p>
<p>（十一）福建省　旱、水、風災</p>
<p>（十二）四川省　水災</p>
<p>（十三）江蘇省　水災、蝗災</p>
<p>（十四）靑海省　旱災</p>
<p>這些還是人所漠視的「小災」雖則在以前已足爲史書特載，帝皇下詔「罪己」的重大事件，而入民國以來，眞是司空見慣渾閒事了。但發生於七月間，到現在正激烈的黄河决口，汜濫河北，山西，河南，山東，浸淫至江蘇，造成災民三四百萬，就是在多災的今日，實也不能不謂是可重視的了。</p>
<p>在以前，正和古埃及的文明依靠尼羅河而發展一様，中國民族生長發達之速，長江與黄河的功力不少。但事至今日，長江每年常有一次水漲，已爲中部居民日爲「禍水，」而現在，黄河更成爲眞正的「黄禍」了。其實，又何止是黄河如此、每一條有益於吾人生活河流、都可在倐忽間變成禍水的。</p>
<p>文明人的特徵，在於能克服「自」然界的侵害，並利用自然界的資源，而二十世紀的中國人，無異是回復到了洪巟時代的生活。災荒是年年有的，防汛，防災，搶險也成了老調。防災是不困難的，但也是最困難的。在歷史上素負盛名，向爲外人所贊嘆不己的黄河水利工程現在是破壞無餘了！在水利工程不絶地破壞過程中，而希望防災防汛有辦法，關鍵所在，惟問政治能否上軌道。</p>
<p>災深矣！民困矣！河災之救濟，尙在發軔，而前昨三日間，八個風力之颶風，江浙沿海一帶，同被侵襲，此皆棉稻之鄕，其損害程度如何，尙未可知。如果所害甚重，則雪上加霜，農村興復，更爲遙遠，此則深望當局加之意也。</p>

<p>— 天一</p>
<p>（轉載大公報醫學週刋）</p>
<p>近日各報對於新舊醫學，時時有所論列。驟視之，似有小題大作之嫌；細思之則近關科學之消長，遠及國民之强弱，誠不容吾人緘默也。</p>
<p>吾人於討論此問題之前請先言車之進化。按椎輪爲大輅之始，大輅已非椎輪之比。近年火車，汽車，電車發明，方之大輅，不僅霄壤之别，較之推輪，更無從比擬矣。試執途人而問之曰火車與大車孰爲任重而致遠，輕便而易達，吾敢斷言其必應聲曰火車。今於醫何獨不然。周秦以前祇言鍼灸，漢祚將終始興方藥，唐代輸入佛醫，宋季雜以理學，金元四家，一時稱盛，明淸之季，稍稍凌替。近世紀來新醫始入中國。故内經傷寒之載籍，比之今日新醫，無異椎輪大輅，寗待思索，而後可加以剖判哉。</p>
<p>說者動以舊醫，承數千年之衣鉢，必有其存在之價値。不知其所以存至今日者，乃因無一較好之醫學輸入以代替之。有如椎輪如無大輅及他種車輛之發明，則其沿用至今無疑，又如新大陸設無歐人發現而入居之，必仍爲黑人所有，其環塡習慣，必仍是千年舊物而無所改革。凡事有比較，然後有優劣，優劣分則　者存，醫之立足於社會，新耶舊耶，寗能逃此天演之公例。</p>
<p>我國人士多抱尊古成見，並富排外之思想。此直吾民族千百年相承之特性，故今之反對新醫者絶無絲毫足以駭怪之點。茲撮述明淸兩代一二史料如下，不識閱者作何感想！</p>
<p>（一）晚明因大統曆發見舛誤，萬曆末年遂利瑪寳（ＭａｔｔｅｏＲｉｃｃｉ）龐迪我（ＶｉｅｇｏｄｅＰａｎｇｊａ）熊三技（ＳａｂａｔｔｈｉｒｕｓｄｅＵｒｓｉｓ）諸外人以修曆之任復有徐元扈李凉庵諸人以張之。當時新舊之爭極烈，最著者爲魏文魁，冷守忠。迨淸季，順康之交德人湯若望（ＳａｂａｌｌｙｏｎＢｅｌｌ）掌欽天監事。楊光先等詆諶新法，不遺餘力，著一書名曰不得已書。其後楊取湯之位而代之。旋以推步失實，黜革，自是閧議始息。</p>
<p>（二）淸同治四年英人杜蘭德在北京宣武門外造一鐵路，因輿論反對，飭令撤毁。十三年英商邪台馬其沙實業公司築淞滬鐵路，後因溤焌光沈葆禎反對，卒將其買回掘毁。光緒六年李鴻章奏請築唐胥鐵路，行車未久，言官復連章彈劾，經幾許波折，始克開駛。當時反對者以無事生事，震動陵寢，所噴黑烟，有傷禾稼爲理由。至今貽爲話柄。</p>
<p>由是觀之，凡新舊之爭，彼亦一是非，此亦一是非。新者循序發揮，舊者竭力掙扎，所謂勢不得已，理所當然。迨事過境遷，優者勝而劣者敗，進化之成例難逃，誠有不期然而然者。椎輪大輅之構造如何，形式如何，恐今世鮮有知之者矣。</p>
<p>然吾人不得不向新醫學者進一忠告，即勿負其救濟疾苦，改强民種之重大使命也。當明季引用利瑪寳諸人之際，其曆數之學何等精密，然非徐李輩發揚而光大之，恐其成就未必若是之偉大也。徐文定自著勾股義一書，凉庵著同文算指圜谷容較義等書，對於曆算均有相當之發明，不僅以亦步亦趨爲盡能事者也。且文定之言白欲求超勝，必須會通，今我國人之習新醫者，年漸增多，試問其能會通者若干人，能超勝者若干人，按圖索驥，不知能免令人失望否也。</p>
<p>仰更有進者曾聞新醫中尙有其人，學識未充，見病症而進退失據，或索錢包治，跡類江湖，或細行不矜，受人詬病，此雖少數，然胥足爲新醫發展之障礙。故吾人願習此業者，自知其職業之高尙，責任之重大，精研學術，求會通以資超勝，克治私德，恤人言而保身分，誠於中形於外，盛德日彰，成績卓著。使知者心識悅服，即向日之詆毁新醫者，亦將以衆論所歸，不容再持異議。從此新醫學術化行全國，使玄秘無聊之舊說，如椎輪大輅之絶跡於人間，豈非我民族之大幸。新醫諸君其韙我言乎，愛之深不覺言之切，是亦晨鐘之一擊耳</p>
<h3 id="c220">焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書之商榷（續） <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>焦先生說：一此外寒者熱之熱者寒之，雖然内經上也這麽說，國醫對他却不　執，不料西醫妙語得之；我們知道一般熱病那種高熱現象，往往是生理機能之毒素的反應作用，正宜　之發揮充分，西醫居然會用冰囊把他導散了去，高熱的現象分明低落，却是生命也跟着危險起來。」這話我覺得更要商榷；焦先生所說的「生理機能之霉素的反應」這句理由，在貴國醫們的書獲是沒有的，當然是科學醫說出來的話，焦先生會知道這個理由，難道他們用冰囊的西醫倒反不知道麽？旣知道這種理由，却會再來用冰囊，當然那時候更有比這種理由更加適切病情的條件在裏面，方才有用冰囊的必要。粗淺的　給焦先生聽聽：第一是高熱發得時間長久了，腦子裏面是要發生障故的！土　呌　「熱皆，」尤其是小兒和老人，更是當不起高熱。第二是高熱的時候，心的工作也非常亢進，亢進過分了，是要疲倦衰弱的！所以我們碰着長期間高熱的病人，就要顧慮到病人的腦和心，務不管他因了高熱發生副作用，來增加病態和喪先生命。但對付高熱和調節高熱的法兒，最簡便的，最有效的，最無害的，最可以操縱由我的，就是冰囊。國人的心理頂怕是風寒，却不曉得熱的可畏，在夏日裏害了熱性病，空氣的温度高至攝氏寒暑表三十六七度左右，病人的體温高至四十度左右，那時候却還要謹遵着「風爲百病之長」的瞎話，緊閉着窗户，不許空氣流通，把病人蒸得昏厥過去，還不肯放鬆，社會上這種謬誤的風習，無常識的舉動，我們是常常碰着的。這種社會，敎他洞開窗户，流通空氣，已經是駭人聽聞，若是敎他用冰，豈不要嚇死呢？這眞是「夏蟲不可以語冰」的話兒了。想不到焦先生也會抱着這種觀念，說出這種論調，似乎對於學理的推討，太膠執而欠通達一點罷？</p>
<p>焦先生要攻擊我們冰囊，又恐怕我們拿着内經「寒者熱之熱者寒之」的話去反駁他，於是把「國醫對他却不膠執」一句滑頭話來輕輕掩飾過去，唉！焦先生太乖覺了，從學理上探討起來，膠執有膠執的學理，不膠執有不膠執的學理，什麽時候應該膠執，什麽時候不應該膠執，都要以學理爲根據，那班　　文明不進步，器械不優良，診察不精礦的國醫們，簡直是盲　　　　，　跑　闖，連「膠執」兩字也該不到還有什麽「不膠執」可能呢？越出學理軌道的話，請不必一再欺騙國人罷！</p>
<p>焦先生說：「其次藥的貧乏，知道了什麽病，不知道用什麽藥，因爲有許多藥西醫根本沒有，要等着外國來發明，外國早發明一日，他們早得引用一日，外國遲發明一日，他們還得引用一日，外國一輩子不發明出來，他們只得朝着病人望望的了。最普通的比如傷寒，肺癆，痲瘋，何着有一項特效藥，尤其是痲瘋一項，隔别的敎他住着，　死以外，毫無辦法，」這番責備，做科學醫的應該接受！因爲科學醫的立塲，是科學研究，是負荷發明的使命，但是焦先生吓！國人吓！研究是什麽一回事，發明是什麽一回事，野蠻人和半開化民族的特　，把研究發明的事都看得非常輕鬆，焦先生吓！國人吓！研究發明不是模模糊糊隨隨便便的事情，是要有研究處所，要有研究時間，要有研究資本，國家社會對於眞正的學問不曉得提倡，對於眞正學者不曉得供養，使得一班有研究本領有研究素養有研究手腕的學問家，閑散在社會上而，奔走衣食，尙且來不及，還有什麽工夫什麽金錢來做研究的事項呢？至於學校方面，若是做校長的人，不是滑頭，不會想别的方法，一本正經，仰着政府的敎育費來辦學校，恐怕連敎授薪水尙且要欠起來，還想設立什麽研究室，撥充什麽研究費？除非是不顧國立的字様，不撑中央的塲面，濫向外國財團捐金錢，括地皮，還可以稍稍活動一點，此外簡直是毫無施展的辦法，在這種狀况之下，還有什麽研究什麽發明可講呢？　　府的人員，應該對於學術機關，對於國内的專門家，深深抱歉，方才算有良心，虧焦先生做了幾多年的官，倒翻向國人宣言，責備我們不研究不發明起來，眞是奇怪得可笑。焦先生呀！研究發明，是有代價的東西。不是可以不勞而獲的，不是　貴國醫們河間說中風是火而外，東垣會說是氣，丹溪會說是痰，談談紙上的兵，就可以算研究，就可以算發明了？科學家是不許掉槍花，不肯說空話，並不怕瞞不過國人，爲是恐怕騰笑世界貽譏有識，在我國學術界留下汚點！</p>
<p>再，小小的研究，小小的發明，國内的專門家，已經有相當成績發表出來，不過上不來焦先生的眼就是了。但是焦先生要把一切難治的病，一起責成現代的醫學家來發明特效藥，否則就說是朝着病人望望，就說是毫無辦法，這點話，覺得太不近常理了。回顧看看貴國醫，究竟朝著病人做點什麽辦法？我到要請敎一下，特效藥發明到怎様醫富？我到要請敎一下，不要忙！焦先生還有贊歎國醫的藥物豐富一段妙文在下面，我本想提早把他意在這裏，使得國人讀者可以兩兩比較，爲因恐怕紊亂了焦先生的原書次序，所以暫　一下，等到下面再商榷罷。</p>

<p>— 龐束周</p>
<p>第六章　醫藥敎育與刋物</p>
<p>第一節　新醫藥敎育</p>
<p>此外上海尙有私立南洋醫科大學。和私立中德女子醫學校。已在此十年中先後停辦。南洋醫科大學有畢業生數班。中德女子醫學校。創立未久就停。所以並無畢業生。其肄業生大半併入同德醫學院。至於外人辦理者。尙有十五年前的哈佛醫學校。在今之海格路。後即停辦。學生大半留學美國哈佛。這都於本文無大關係。恕不細述。</p>
<p>看了上面的統計。第一使我們知道全上海巿的醫學生不過一千多人。需要的專任敎員倒要一百零四人。加上兼任敎員至六十二人之多。是一件很不經濟的事。也是醫事太不統一的結果。第二使我們驚心的。是號稱國立學校的。偏偏尙沒有完全自有的附屬醫院。而許多學校是外國人辦的。第三雖有幾處國人自辦的私立醫學校却因經濟困難。醫院不能完美。並且反而要少數敎師領導多數學生實習。在重致遠沒人加以輔助。長此以往有沒有流幣。第四學生最少的國立上海醫學院。和敎會設立的女子醫學院。却最多敎師。平均起來。是九十和六十八的比例。差不多一個敎師。只敎一個半學生。未免是一件很夠尋味的事。根據上述四端。我認爲上海醫藥敎育。與中國的國情還有些不稱。而表現着畸形。因此我聯想到。「焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書」中間。詬病衛生署年耗巨欵。一無建樹。也許是從畸形的衛生行政上。作片面的觀察。而發爲攻訐之論。然而借此就抺煞科學。提倡玄醫可謂因噎廢食。糊塗透頂。</p>
<p>除醫科藥科學校之外。還有助產學校。也要算上海爲最多。目前存在的計有八個；</p>
<p>中德產科學校　學生一百廿六人</p>
<p>同德產科學校　學生一百十一人</p>
<p>大德產科學校　學生約五十人</p>
<p>惠生助產學校　學生約七十人</p>
<p>人和產科學校　學生約八十人</p>
<p>慈航產科學校　學生約六十人</p>
<p>保生助產學校　本學期初辦學生數未詳</p>
<p>生生助產學校　本學期初辦學生數未詳</p>
<p>已經停辦的計有三校　㈠大華產科學校　㈡健華產科學校　㈢栢特利產科學校</p>
<p>凡是上面所稱的產科學校。只是招收女生。養成接生的助產婦。修業的年限不過二年。入學的資格不過初中畢業。學校的設備。由敎育局規定。還不甚麻煩。以上海巿的人材。要尋些產科學校的敎師。當然不難。以上海巿的人口。要吸收些平民產婦作敎材。當然也容易。所以近十年來。這種學校。意如雨後春筍。次第成立。照上面的八校每一年平均。就可產生畢業生三百人。這原是良好的現象。並且社會人士。對於新法接生的信仰心。確乎比對於其他醫藥來得重些。所以若干年後。推行新助產方法。而廢除穩婆是很樂觀的事。只可惜助產學校。内地不多。小縣偏邑。就缺乏。而這種學校。都聚在上海這繁華都巿。却有一點小小流弊。因爲各地女生到上海。受了這種專門敎育。往往本身的生活。先都巿化。而不大肯回到鄕村去執行她們的業務。以致上海的助產婦。有過剩現象。而流爲女看護的很多。内地依然感受缺乏。我前幾年。曾經在華北醫報撰一篇文字。詳論產科學校設在最大都巿的不宜。不想如今大都巿更多。而内地仍不能發逹。此中自有許多社會問題上的原因。與時局上的關係。此時亦不便多論了。</p>
<h3 id="c223">藥房營業之眞義（三） <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>就藥房營業性質之不同，在歐洲各國可别爲二種；一屬專門職業商店，一屬善通買賣商店，前者本篇中名爲正式藥房，後者名爲普通藥商店，且有數國家對於藥房稱呼上可區别其營業性質，例如意大利稱正式藥房爲“Ｆａｒｗａｃｉａ”，普通藥商店爲“Ｄｒｏｇｕｅｒｉａ”若德若法等國亦均有區别的稱號，非若吾國統稱爲“Ｄｉｓｐｅｎｓａｒｙ”美國單稱爲“Ｐｈａｒｍａｃｙ”而日本亦有類似歐洲制度。正式者稱爲某某藥房，普通者稱爲某某店，所以區别其稱呼者，即含有營業種類之區别，國家易於管理，而藥商俾明其責任所在，不致淆惑營業也。</p>
<p>意大利之藥房營業</p>
<p>羅馬之藥業制度與西班牙葡萄牙同，其正式藥房可售一切藥品及毒物與配方，兼理分析顯微鏡工作，其普通藥商店只許售家常藥與普通商品，國家實施藥房法甚嚴，且藥房之數亦有定額，都城有藥房二百五十所，而普通藥商店則無此限。近時正式藥房已抵足額，故藥師欲經營此業，只有購諸他人之已開設者，普通藥商店本無法律規定，因得國民之援助，尙無流弊，其所收效果興正式藥房同，不過正式藥房可售一切毒藥配方，兼理分析等工作，與普通藥商店無此專門工作，僅售商品，逈有不同耳，故此兩種營業，界限分明，絶無淆惑之弊也。</p>
<p>正式藥房之任務旣如上述，則其與醫界有相當之聯絡，自不待言，故伊大利醫藥職業上之融洽，洵爲可慶之點也。甚有藥師設病人待診室，因顧客之來藥房，須待醫師診病開方，然後就地配藥，而醫師亦得藥師之試騐室工作，藉以迅速診斷，便利匪淺，實則藥房即診所也，謂之藥房診所亦可，故伊大利之醫師，不兼配藥，即業務上不侵佔他人，其醫藥之融洽，職業遭德有以致之耳，但醫藥兩師，對於普通藥商，一無情感。以其智識朧昧，必竟斥爲行外也。</p>
<p>德國之藥房營業</p>
<p>德國正式藥房稱亞泡台格，爲有限制的，其定額視區域之不同與居民比例，自一與六千至一與一萬之比。普通藥商店不得售毒藥與記方等營業，其實施藥房法甚嚴，藥師資格之完成，即考取後尙須經二年之正式藥房見習，方可領到在德境開業執照，即有獨立執業之資格。按德國正式藥房爲有限訓，非由補缺，或經特許，不得開設。欲請特許，非備具各種必要條件，及充實資本不可，故罕有年齡在五十以下者，而　膺特許者焉。（未完）</p>

<p>— 陳方之</p>
<p>求全之毁</p>
<p>有一天，我在寧波家裏，來了一個電話，是我好友兼親戚的某君打來的，他說：「有一位陸女士，有病甚劇，她在某大醫院，住了二個月光景，據說肺已壞，心也壞；腹膜也壞；胃腸也壞；壞到無可救藥了，要想請你去評評，你意下如何？」我說：「陸女士我也知道，她兒女狠多，如有病苦，我狠表同情，當然可以去看他的。但旣然住過某大醫院，該院是說什麽病名呢？」他說：「肺癆病罷腹膜炎說是也有。」我說：「其自覺的徴象，是什麽様呢？咳嗽有麽？發熱麽？」他說：「發熱的，咳嗽不大有，從前說有膨脹，肚子大，現在好了。小便時有些痛，月經常常要來，來時狠長久，甚至隔兩禮拜就來了，這個徴象，已有四個月。」我說：「如此說來，是有婦人科的病了，應該還須招婦人科醫生看看，而且請她先將小便送來，先化騐看看，可作診時的參考。」他說：「小便就送來，婦人科醫生，就請你代招罷。」</p>
<p>我等他們小便送來以後，騐過，蛋白只有痕跡，膿球及表皮細胞甚多，就小便而論，完全是膀胱炎的證佐，别無其他，於是　一位婦人科的醫友，同到陸女士府上，先就内科範圍内，爲之詳細診察，其肺部，除左肺尖打音稍硬外，别無異狀，肺癆云云，完全不對，其左肺尖稍硬處，或有陳舊過去的結核病灶，但别無能働性的肺結核，可以推知。其心臟，别無不純雜音，不過搏動加速，與脈搏加速，（每分百二十六主）同爲全身衰弱的徵象。</p>
<p>其全身衰弱，從何而來，正是眼前的問題，再診察其腹部，腹壁柔軟如常，别無腫脹狀態，亦無腹水，問其何故有膨脹之說，她們說：「從前腫過的，腫時緊張疼痛，連屁都不放，敲起來捧捧嚮的」呀！知道了，原來是膀胱炎初起時所引起的膨脹，誤認爲腹膜炎了。呀！原來如此。再診其腹内，肝脾腎等，别無腫脹狀態，唯小腹部稍有壓痛，乃膀胱炎的緣故。</p>
<p>總之，他們所稱肺也壞，心也壞；腹膜也壞；腹腸也壞的病人，不料由不學無術的我看起來，件件都未嘗壞，不過有心臟衰弱的徵象，是從全身衰弱而來。我就推知她是惡液質，恐怕子宫有疾，於是請婦科醫用子宫鏡檢查，果然子宫生癌，於是百事了解了，問她某大醫院有否看過子宫呢，她說未曾看過，呀！原來如此。</p>
<p>我以爲我們給她診斷出這個病名，使她糊裏糊塗的病，弄得明明白白，終要算有功了，不意就在這明白之間，出了　情，尙使人云亦云的過去，就說她臓腑皆病，必定是無事了。如今我庸人自擾，看出她是子宫癌，就多事了，病家就說：「子宫癌有什麽辦法呢？」我們說：「有辦法的時期，已躭誤了，現在已不能手術。」病家說：「那末，還有什麽好的方法呢？」我們說：「只有用鐳錠照照看，可惜寗波法。」病家說：「上海有沒有？」我們說：「當然有的。」病家說：「那可以到上海去照麽？」我們說：「到了這個時期，鐳錠館照出多少効果，也不能保險，但去總可以去的。」病家說：「在去的路上，有沒有危險？」我說：「寗波到上海，只有一夜功夫，那我可以保險的。」我們的診察談，就此而終。後來她們到上海，不知道進什麽醫院？也不知道着什麽醫生？也不知道醫生怎様說法？也不知道鐳錠有沒有照？聽說過了十幾天死了！癌的惡液質，當然是死人的病症，死也何足爲奇，在我以爲陸女士的死，已經把死的原因，弄得淸楚明白，不像大多數的人們，死在糊裏糊塗的糊塗堆裏了。</p>
<p>後來從許多朋友，傳到我耳朶裏，說這個病家，只除了已經不會說話的她，統統都說我不好，第一是醫術不好，因爲他們到上海，上海的醫生，也說心肝脾肺腎，統統都壞的，與某大醫院相吻合，可見得陳方之是錯的；第二是良心不好，說我明明知道病人要死，故意送她到上海去死的，種種胡言亂道，我也　不了許多。</p>

<h3 id="c225">傳記文學 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>中國的傳記文學，自太史公以來，直到現在，盛行着的，總還是列傳式的那一套老花様。若論變體，則子孫爲父祖飾門面的墓誌，哀啓，行述之類，所謂諛墓之文，或者庶乎近之。可是這些，也總是千篇一律，人人死後，一例都是智仁勇皆備的完人，從沒有看見過一篇活生生地能把人的弱點短處都刻劃出來的傳神文字。不過水滸也名曰傳，文藝批評家視爲一百零八人的合傳，阿Ｑ也有正傳，新文學流行了十幾年的中間，只有阿Ｑ最爲人所知道。若把道一類文學，都當作傳記來看，則孫悟空的西遊，董小宛的憶語，也都是傳記了，我所說的傳記文學，範圍决沒有這様的廣闊。</p>
<p>那麽，中國所缺少的傳記文學，是那一種東西呢？正因爲中國缺少了這些所以連一個例都尋找不出來。若從外國文學裏來找材料，則千古不朽的傳記作品，實在是很多很多。時代稍舊一點體例略近於史記，而内容却全然不同的，有泊魯泰克Ｐｌｕｔａｒｃｈ的希臘羅馬偉人列傳。時代較近，把一人一世的言行思想，性格風度，及其周圍環境，描寫得極微盡致的，有英國鮑思威兒Ｂｏｓｗｅｌｌ的約翰生傳。以飄逸的筆致，淸新的文體，旁敲側擊，來把一個人的一生，極有趣味地叙寫出來的，有美國Ｌｔｔｏｎ　Ｓｔｒｃｈｅｙ的維多利亞女皇傳，法國Ｍａｕｒｏｉｓ的奢萊傳，皮貢司非而特公傳。此外若德國的愛米兒，露特唯希，若意大利的喬之尼，巴披尼等等所作的生龍活虎似的傳記，舉起來眞舉不勝舉。　　正唯其是中國缺少了這一種文學的傳記作家，所以近來巿塲上只流行了些自唱自吹的自傳與帶襲帶抄的評傳之類：但從一代偉人像孫中山那様的巨子，還在登報懸賞徵求傳記的一點看來，則中國傳記文學的衰落，也就可想而知了。</p>
<h3 id="c226">論凑趣 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>就是傳說要來華而至今還沒有來的法　國文豪巴塞爾（Ｈｅｎｒｉ　Ｂａｒｂｕｓｓｅ）。他在一本小書上，當使用「智識階級」這一句話的時候，特地聲明道：</p>
<p>「智識階級丨我是以此稱思想的人們不是以此稱知趣者，吹牛者，拍馬者，精神利用者。」</p>
<p>「知趣者」即善於凑趣的人的意思。凑趣，吹牛，拍馬，精神利用：這四種都是所謂「二丑藝術。」但在技術上，一四兩種要難得多，運用得好，成功較易，運用得不好，碰壁也較易。而且這兩種藝術家的身分，也比吹牛家，拍馬家要高得多，因爲吹牛，拍馬，不過分明是一個勢利的奴才的工夫。但凑趣家和精神利用家，却頗像一個紳士，在主子門下，是稱爲「賓客」的。</p>
<p>我現在只來說一說凑趣。</p>
<p>要從凑趣家中，舉出一個典型來，我以爲最好是舉楊修，即連彌衡都看得起的「小兒楊德祖」。文士傳說他「少有才學思幹」，世說新語盛稱他的「捷悟」，但實際上，他的才學思幹，他的捷悟，不過做了曹操的下酒物，他一生的致力，就在凑趣上。曹操在自己的「相國門」上，題了一個「活」字，他馬上就呌人把門拆去重造，唯他知道「王正嫌門大」。曹操在一盒食物上寫了一個「合」字，他馬上就吃，唯他知道「公敎人噉一口也」。此外還有「絶妙好辭」的故事，「竹椑楯」的故事，都是楊修一生中最出色的行狀。那時候連曹操也有「我才不及卿」之歎。别人當然要「服其辯悟」了，因爲不及他那様的善於凑趣。</p>
<p>然而，最後一次的凑趣，他却大大地碰了壁，連性命都碰掉了。「鷄肋」事件，許多人爲楊修呼寃，其實曹操的主意是不錯的，因爲凑趣只宜於平時，倘在軍國大事上也亂凑起來，是免不了貽誤的，在這方面，曹操所親信的乃是典韋，許褚之流。但曹操竟把楊修殺掉，則其覇辣，誠然是個大花面。</p>
<p>時至今日，凑趣的情形，大有變動了。第一，現在是於凑個人的趣之外，還要凑集團的趣。第二是因物質上的便利，凑趣者可以不必當着主子的面，只要在報章雜誌上發表一些文字，也有被賞識的希望。</p>
<p>然而，無論何代爲主子的。他們固然高興有人凑趣，但在實際地幹的時候，他們信用的還是另一種人。</p>
<p>追究到古代去。食客三千人的孟嘗君，後來不是覺悟了「鷄鳴狗盜之徒」更合於實用麽？</p>
<p>這様看來凑趣家的運氣，似乎是向來就不很發旺的。</p>
<p>據我想來，這不發旺的原因，第一，就是他們只會凑趣：第二，是他們太要給自己留身分，不及拍馬家吹牛家那麽痛快，因而使主子也覺得他們的臭架子的不可耐。</p>
<p>世說新語中還有這様一個故事：</p>
<p>「范玄平爲人好用智數，而有時以多數失。會嘗失官居東陽桓大司馬在南州，故往投之。桓時方欲招起屈滯，以傾朝廷，且玄平在京素亦有譽，桓謂遠來投己，喜躍非常……范雖實投桓，而恐以趨時損名，乃曰：『雖懷朝宗，會有亡兒療在此，故來省親』。桓悵然失望，向之虛佇，一時都盡」。</p>
<p>這種作態，實在是二丑藝術的精髓。可惜桓温也是個大花面，（雖然我不曾在戲台上見過他，想當然耳。），所以竟不屑意，使范先生撲了一個空。</p>
<p>原來，二丑藝術，是只爲驅驅扮公子哥兒的小丑的。</p>

<p>我們如果承認戲劇是民衆敎育之一種的話，那麽我們就看見中國民衆所常常得到的精神的養料是什麽様的東西了。這些東西抓住他們，使他們一天天往後面走，不讓他們前進一步。然而那些靠「文化」吃飯的高等紳士們除了提倡國劇外，還送了扮女人的戲子出洋，在外國騙了招牌回來欺騙民衆。他們說是拿這種「文化」在精神上征服了外國。</p>
<p>舞臺上的粉紅幕在這晚上最後一次地落下來了。觀衆爭着走出去。許多人擁擠在門口，情形顯得很混亂，要通過那門是比較費力的。在一陣肉與肉的撞擊以後，我和那兩個朋友終於走下樓出戲院，站在長堤上了。</p>
<p>時間是十二點過鐘。那個朋友還約我到一個小店裏去吃點心，但我的疲倦使我謝絶了。我别了他們，一個人走在長堤上，穿過黄包車的包圍中，慢慢兒向着海珠橋走去。</p>
<p>我的心是寂寞的。許多憂鬰的思想包圍着我。眼前是一片陰暗，沒有光明，沒有前途，所有的只是一些鬼影。一種强烈的憎恨在我的心裏燃燒起來，我詛咒中國的一切舊戲，我詛咒中國的一切舊的遺產我詛咒整個的東方文化。我絶望地問；現在是不是眞有一個人關心着中國的民族的前途，（我相信定有的）爲什麽就不看見一個人出來對那眞正毒害着中國民族的所謂東方文化加以嚴厲的攻擊？（我相信一定有的）爲什麽就沒有一個人知道現在充滿着中國的那些畸形的怪物都是所謂東方文化的產物，他們思想行爲沒有一様不是和那些鬼魂的相似？（我相信一定有的。）</p>
<p>四庫全書是寳物，故宫的古物是寳物，佛寺是寳物，古蹟是寳物……凡是一切可以在這向新路上掙扎的民族的腦裏留下陰影的東西都是統治階級的寳物！許多人這様相信着。然而事實上沒有這些東西，中國民衆倒可以生活得更好一點。爲什麽現代的人就應該知道那些舊時代的鬼把戲？人類不是靠歷史生活的歷史雖然呌人不要怎様做，結果反而是呌人去模倣了游凡爾賽宫的人至少總有一半想做路易十四。遊故宫的人在那一瞬間總會有一點異様的鬼影似的思想。</p>
<p>我們正需要忘掉一切，以一種新的力量向新的路上邁進。這是我們的唯一的出路。然而别人却拿種種的古董來抓住我們的靈魂。使我們永遠陷在奴隷的深淵裏。高等紳士們提倡舊戲是無足怪的。現在連一些本來與筆墨無緣的人也知道提倡讀經了。在這種環境裏想到中國民族的前途我不能不感到悲憤了。</p>
<p>我的思想大槪是不會有人了解的。記得在東方雜誌本年的關於夢想的徵文裏我曾表示過上面的那種意見，我說東方文化這名詞裏所包含的種種古董遮住了我的眼睛。使我看不見中國的未來，而且有一個時期使我甚至相信中國是沒有未來的。這意思是很明顯的。</p>
<p>然而許多人都因此稱我爲悲觀論者。　我果然是悲觀論者麽？</p>
<p>回到河南的機器工會，我寛鬆地嘆了一口氣。我現在算是回到人間來了。</p>

<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>女的口上說，「船壞了並不碍事，」心中却想着：「應當布比這小船兒更堅固結賽的「小船」，容載這個心，向寛泛無邊的人海中搖去！」她看看面前，却正泊着一隻理想的小船。强健的胳膊，强健的靈魂，一切皆還不曾爲人事所髒汚。如若有所得的微笑着，她幾乎是本能地感到了他們的未來一切。</p>
<p>她覺得自己是美麗的，且明白在面前一個人眼光中，她幾乎是太美麗了她明白他曾又怯又貪注意過她的身體每一部分。她有些羞恧，但她却不怕他也不厭煩他。</p>
<p>他毫無她可疑，只是一個大學一年生，一切興味同觀念，就是對女人的一分知識，也不會離開那一年級生的限制。他讀書並不多，對於人生的認識有限，他慢慢的在學習都巿中人的生活，他也會成爲庸碌而無個性的城巿中人。她初初看他，好像全不俗氣，多談了幾句話，就明白凡是高級中學所輸入於學生的那分壞處，這個人也完全得到他應得的一分。但不知怎麽様的希奇原因，這帶着鄕下人氣分的男子，單是那點野處單純處，使她總覺得比紳士有意思些。他並不十分聰明，但初生小犢似的天下事，什麽都不怕的勇氣，彷彿雖不使他聰明，却將令他偉大。眞是的，這孩子可以偉大起來！</p>
<p>她問他：</p>
<p>「你每天洗海水浴嗎？」</p>
<p>他點着頭，故她又問：</p>
<p>「你到什麽時候方離開這海濱？」</p>
<p>「我自己也不知道。」</p>
<p>「自己應當知道自己。想怎麽様就怎麽様，你難道不想麽？」</p>
<p>「我想也沒有用處。」</p>
<p>「你這是小孩子說法，還是老頭子說法？小孩子，相信爸爸，因爲家中人管束着他，可以那麽說。老頭子相信上帝，因爲一切事皆以爲上帝早有安排，故常常也不去過分折磨自己情感。你………」</p>
<p>女的說到這裏時，她眼看着身邊那一個有一分害羞的神氣，她就不再說下去了。她估計得出他不是個「老頭子」。她笑了。</p>
<p>那男子爲了有人提說到小孩與老人，意思正像請他自行挑選，他便不得不說出下面的話語。</p>
<p>「我跟了我爸爸來的。我爸爸在ＸＸ部裏作參事」有人請我們上勞山去，我在山上住了兩天厭倦了，獨自跑回來了，爸爸還在山上做詩！」</p>
<p>「你爸爸會做詩嗎？」</p>
<p>「他是詩人，他同梁任公夏ＸＸ曾………」</p>
<p>「啊，你是ＸＸ先生的少爺嗎？」</p>
<p>「你認識我爸爸嗎？」</p>
<p>「在ＸＸ講演時我見過一次，我認得他他不認識我。」</p>

<h3 id="c230">擦皮鞋少將 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>這一向，就時常聽朋支們說：霞飛路有一員擦皮鞋的少將。當時我以爲必定又是所謂「羅宋」少將了，這算什麽希奇？因爲霞飛路上有不少的小偷三之類，都是前沙皇時代的貴族白俄，能有一技之長爲人家擦皮鞋而得以維持生命的，這眞應當算是上焉者的幸運兒了。然而我是猜錯了，這一員少將，江其姓，民聲其名，道道地地却是咱們大中華民國的一員少將，而又是一員曾經爲爭民族生命浴血抗日過的少將！</p>
<p>昨日本報本埠新聞裏，就以大標題載着這員擦皮鞋少將的新聞。據載：少將，哈爾濱人，前隷東北抗日將領丁超部下。流落滬濱，由難民救濟會給資購擦皮鞋油粉在霞飛路爲行人擦鞋，堪以生活，昨持函送救濟會并捐　五元以救濟東北難民，函中報告收支并致謝忱。</p>
<p>以堂堂一員少將，蹲在街頭巷尾爲路人擦皮鞋，當然要給一班「老爺」之類或是所謂「有志氣」的硬漢笑爲卑微下流而哼着「不如去死吧」的了！但亦有人在說：假使他不是一個傻子而能　投到「滿洲國」的懷抱裏去，而今他不仍然是一人之下萬人之上威風凛凛殺氣騰騰的一員少將嗎？當然他有人會因之感慨地說：抗日陣亡的官兵，國家還請了和尙道士來唸經給他一個追薦，殘存而流落了的倒聽其自然地沒有誰去顧問，頂多也只有民衆團體的些微而不普遍的救助！這不是厚待死者嗎？怕死者到陰司閻王那裏去告陰狀因而震怒了閻王老子，把熱烈抗日的將領兵士，一齊捉去，不是爲好歹成氣，倒弄出一塲大禍來麽？最幽默而最沉痛的口調却是：江民聲只不過也是一個爲了愛國而抗日的脚色，僥倖而不死，更僥倖而有救濟會而能爲路人擦皮鞋而就得以繼續生命，難道還不知足嗎？比之同様爲了愛國而擲彈警告奸商的劉崇武之輩被認爲「犯法」而嘗着鐵窗風味的，其優厚，恩典，榮幸，眞不可以同日而語不可以道里計了！</p>
<p>然而這些，似乎都不大相干。事實擺在我們臉面前而刺激着我們眼珠的，是：江民聲是一員在東北義勇軍裏爲爭民族國家生存而與帝國主義者浴血抗戰過的少將，現在流落在這歌舞狂歡昇平景氣的上海霞飛路上「海上第一壯麗雄偉高貴建築」的「國泰大戲院」對面弄堂口爲路人抹擦皮鞋！</p>
<p>嗚呼抗日！嗚呼抗日而沒有死在戰塲上的官兵！</p>
<h3 id="c231">太平捐 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 伊嚴</p>
<p>在處處地方，都可現出我們貴國同胞是愛好和平的，如應時的募太平公醮捐和以前我們募抗日捐或航空捐成績的比例，就是一個很好的證明。</p>
<p>我記得月前有二位童子軍來我的衖堂募航空捐，我的貴鄰，十有九家餉以閉門羹，甚至有些還要　咕嚕一陣道：「小弟弟，募捐買什麽飛機，打什麽東洋人，中國亡了尙不關我們大人們的事，倒關小孩子什麽事？」喂，朋友！你切莫道他們是冷血動物，他們是厭惡戰爭的，他們要佈施在求和平的路上去呢！</p>
<p>看吧！近來我們的衖堂中，每有一種「大享派碼「應時的寫捐人物走進來，他們手中拿了本捐簿，幌子是「提倡和平」老實不客氣的挨次敲着人家後門。</p>
<p>「老太太，請你寫點太平公捐，保保本衖堂四季平安，」他們對着一位來開後門的老太婆說着。</p>
<p>「是捐了打太平醮嗎？好的好的，我就寫了一只洋吧」直爽氣，這位愛好和平的老太太如此答着。</p>
<p>於是，一元，六角，他們又挨次的募着了，眞的，從未有一家落空，不信嗎？就請看每家後門貼着的黄色收欵證吧！</p>
<p>過了幾天，衖堂裏果然掛滿了燈綵和紙錠，晚上還請了一班全新電氣行頭的文明熖口來打醮，那時衖堂裏一團和氣，擠得水泄不通，那幾位博法鴻術的長老們，施好了餓鬼的飯，還合作唱了一册江北灘黄，眞週到！他們會想到七月中旬的餓鬼，是好久未聽戲了，不過我看在塲聽戲的人，至小要比來聽戲的鬼要多上十倍，唉，這豈是長老們的慈悲本旨呢！</p>
<p>打好醮的翌日，總衖口貼了一張黄</p>
<p>色的賬目表，所收一百多元，恰好用得一個也不剩，不過我們的衖堂同志，對於這篇賬的信仰心，比我們信仰報上登載收授救國捐的賬目，是不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>哈哈！　倒底我們同胞是信仰和平的！</p>

<p>我在家時，使我最可恨的莫過於淸晨，因爲我家是在一條很熱閙人家很多的沿馬路的弄内，而且住的是總弄内弄口的第一家，所以街上的和弄内的聲浪，都是直達到我家的窗户内。一天到晚，甚致在半夜裏，各種嘈雜的聲音，如電車聲，喊賣聲，頑皮孩子的噪閙聲，互相的繼續不停，所以不特白天沒有淸靜，就是深夜也不得安睡的。被在半夜以後，二三點鐘的時候，大都巿完全靜默在睡鄕中了，於是我也能偷安沉醉於甜密之夢。可是刹那的時間，已是黎明之前了，這時候除了晨雞的催醒歌外，還有一種我聽慣的，更可說爲我最痛恨的，　就是那班推獨輪車的苦力，每天來打破我甜密的好夢。轆轆的輪聲，繼續着不停。我迷糊的罵他們不識趣的東西！自己却戀着被窩再朦朧的睡去了，醒來總在三四小時之後。但是有時確被牠們擾擾得不能安睡，張大了眼珠，望着帳頂，想起自己四五年來的飄泊生涯，飽嘗了人生的苦杯，便會聯想到這輩苦力，他們這麽早起來幹什麽？他們是不是不喜歡安睡，來嘗寒暑的交逼？「生活」，斗大兩個字映在我的眼前。我們每天出賣腦力來生活，他們靠着自己的體力，一邊推，一邊走，無論十斤百斤的重載，無論十里百里的遠道，出賣兩條健實的臂，兩條粗黑的腿。黎明出去，昏夜歸來，自早至晚，十幾小時的勞働，每天，每月，每年，寒暑風雨，辛辛苦苦，爲的是每天五六毛的進益，養老撫小，維持一家的生命。一天不做，一家人坐着待斃，他們從活潑的少年到白髮的老翁，幹着這般牛馬的生活。終生沒有安適的居住，美味的營養，精神物質，都是被壓迫者。由苦中生，由苦中死，結果赤裸裸的歸去。然而反顧一般飽暖終日的資本家呢，都靠着勞働者的血汗，享受物質精神的幸福。同様做一個人，爲什麽天壤懸殊丨我想着想着，反由自己的境遇憫憐起他們來。每天在黎明之前，聽見這轆轆的車聲時，我盼望着世界也有黎明的一天！</p>

<p>姨太太：哈哈哈，（大笑，離開兒子的懷抱。）你這個凉血動物，難道你甘心做亡國奴了嗎？</p>
<p>少爺：什麽亡國奴不亡奴，我根本就沒有想到這些。我祇要像這様日　的守着你，隨便做什麽都好。</p>
<p>姨太太：啊喲喲！别說得這麽好聽罷，回頭娶了媳婦，恐怕睬也不睬了！</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen attended a welcome meeting from all circles at 10:00 AM on the 3rd. After reporting on his experiences abroad and his thoughts, he returned to his private residence at Beijiguan and met with Wang Jingwei, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingjiang, and Li Shi. The meeting lasted for one hour. At 12:20 PM, he, along with Vice Minister of Finance Li Diaosheng, Zou Lin, Secretary Huang Chundao, Chief of the Accounting Department Qin Fen, and others, eight people in total, boarded cars and went directly to the Sanbeitou wharf at Xiaguan, boarding the Zhongshan warship to Xun. Song stated before leaving: 1. This trip to Lu is to report to Chiang on his experiences abroad, which will take a maximum of five or seven days, after which he will return to Nanjing to resume his duties. 2. Besides reporting in detail on his travels, there will also be discussions on future financial arrangements. 3. The issue of the allocation of the American cotton and wheat loan has not yet been discussed, as I have only just arrived in the country. However, I believe that the central government has a plan for its allocation. There are rumors that a portion will be allocated for governing the Yellow River, but I have not heard of it. 4. Regarding the previous reports that a national financial conference would be convened, I believe that there is no need to convene it at this time. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Shaokuan, Gu Mengyu, and others plan to travel to Xun on the Hai Rong warship on the 4th. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen telegraphed Xu Shiying, inviting him to Lu to discuss disaster relief matters. Xu departed Shanghai by ship on the evening of the 4th and will pass through Nanjing to Lu on the morning of the 5th. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke, accompanied by Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weichi, departed for Xun via the Dehe ship at noon on the 3rd. Sun stated that the biggest obstacle to the political system being on the right track under the leadership of the party is the lack of unity among party members, which leads to a dispersion of power, resulting in the current tragic state of national defense and the national economy. This is the most regrettable thing for the party. Since our country is lagging behind in everything, and the party intends to save the country, it should support the capable, those who take the responsibility of revitalizing China as their own, those who have solutions and are practical in politics. Party members should prioritize the interests of the country, unite in support, and sincerely assist them. This trip to Lushan will focus on discussing foreign affairs and finance, but there are also other urgent issues that need to be discussed. There is no question that the Sino-US cotton and wheat loan will be used entirely for construction. The Fifth Plenary Session will be held as scheduled. Some people think that if the meeting has few solutions, it is better not to hold it. I believe that if the meeting has no solutions, then not holding the meeting is even worse. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Qingdao and passed through Tai'an, he visited Feng Yuxiang. After arriving in Nanjing, he intended to fly to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Jiang and discuss the issue of Feng's whereabouts. However, he was unable to do so due to illness. Now that Finance Minister Song has returned to the country and is going to Jiangxi to visit Chiang, and Wang Jingwei, Huang Fu, Kong Xiangxi, Li Shizeng, and others are also going to Jiangxi to discuss major plans, Sun has also been invited to go. Sun boarded the Dehe ship for Xun via Nanjing at 11:30 AM on the 3rd, accompanied by Wu Tiecheng and Legislative Committee members Wu Shangying and Chen Junpu. The ship set sail westward at 3:00 PM. Sun told reporters on the ship that this visit to Chiang was to discuss national affairs and that no meeting would be held. He would stay in Lu for about a week, and he might mention Feng's whereabouts. (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Five-Province Negotiation Inspector, Gan Jiehou, stated that after the French occupied nine small islands, the Japanese have recently stated that there are still eight small islands near Qiongzhou, not far from South China, and want to occupy them by force as naval bases. Inspector Gan believes that although there is no substantial evidence to confirm this move by the Japanese, it is necessary to clarify the truth beforehand and plans to send personnel to inspect them within days so that if evidence is obtained, negotiations can be initiated. At the same time, he will inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, inquiring about the situation and the countermeasures to be taken.

<p>Song Attends and Reports on His Trip Abroad Before Going to Lu</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen received Central Committee member Chen Gongbo and Li Shizeng in the morning of the 3rd at 8:00 to discuss important matters. At 10:00, he attended the welcome rally by all circles in Nanjing at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, with over 800 people in attendance. Lei Zhen presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech. Song reported on his trip abroad, with the original text stating: "I have been separated from the people of the capital for four months. I returned from the Pacific last month. I was welcomed by various circles in Shanghai, and yesterday I arrived in the capital. I am grateful for the warm welcome from the people of the capital at the station. Although I have been separated from you for four months, I have more than one thing to share with you today. Due to the limited time, I must briefly mention a few facts and feelings as a form of gratitude. Four months ago, I was ordered by the government to attend the World Economic Conference. I first went to Washington, D.C., and as a result of the discussions with the U.S. authorities, the friendship between China and the United States was deepened, and the establishment of the cotton and wheat loan was purely for the construction of our country. On May 21, I issued a joint statement with U.S. President Roosevelt, paying attention to the adoption of necessary plans for the recovery of China and the world's economic life. In mid-June, I attended the London World Economic Conference. Based on the meaning of the previous declaration, I joined the Sino-Indian-American and other nine-nation silver agreement. In addition, in order to provide construction technology, I am also pleased that the League of Nations Administrative Council is willing to continue to expand cooperation with us. After leaving London, I went from England to France, from France to Italy, from Italy to Germany, and then returned home via the United States. This is a rough outline of my experience attending the conference under orders for four months. I went abroad to study more than twenty years ago, and what I saw and heard at that time is completely different from what I see and hear today. Generally speaking, human thought and social systems change with the environment. Today's global panic is due to the decline of the economy. No country in the world can escape this situation. In the countries I visited this time, on the one hand, I felt the various phenomena in this great panic trend, and on the other hand, I paid attention to the methods taken by the governments of various countries to deal with this incident and the attitude of the people towards their governments. In countries such as Russia, Italy, and Germany, the power of the government is something that people in the 19th century could not have dreamed of. Even in England's national government, which is known as a coalition cabinet, all real power is in the hands of the Conservative Party. The power that the new American president has to deal with economic recovery is even greater than during wartime and martial law. On the other hand, since the government's intentions and actions can fully gain the trust of the people, the people's belief in and support for the government does not differ slightly with the size of the government's power. China today is facing a difficult national situation, which is far beyond the remedies of other countries. The government and the people should pay close attention to the good examples of various countries. As a member of the party and a central government official, what I want to contribute to the government and the people is nothing more important than this. The words and deeds of the people of the capital are related to the national outlook. If this meaning can be widely realized from today's gathering, then it is the good fortune of the party and the country." (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Implementation of the North American Economic Recovery Plan <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>The United States of North America, starting from September 1st, has put into effect the economic recovery plan that it has been meticulously preparing for three months. Eighty percent of the country's industry and commerce are behind this new plan, exerting all their strength to fight against the current economic panic. Since the stock market crash of 1929, the market has been in decline. The wealthy and skilled traders of America have tried their best to support it during this turbulent panic tide. As a result, not only has it failed to help the more than twelve million unemployed people, but even those with small fortunes have felt the pain of sluggish business. When the financial panic broke out in March of this year, although the new President Roosevelt strongly maintained his composure and hoped to weather the storm, the country's domestic economic situation deteriorated daily and continued to move towards the path of decline. Therefore, the current president had no choice but to transform from the sole leader in politics to the economic dictator of the United States of North America. The representatives of England and France were still on their way to the White House for talks when the United States announced a ban on cash exports, with a strong trend towards implementing a currency inflation policy.</p>
<p>At that time, the general public in the United States believed that if the external value of the currency fell, then prices would inevitably rise, and exports would be booming. However, the current economic panic has spread throughout the world. Among the major countries, there are only differences in the degree of severity, and there is no fundamental difference. Moreover, the United States is the leader of heavy industry. Its standard of living and its manufacturing capabilities are already one stage higher than those of Eastern countries. It also has a new approach to advanced Western European countries. Furthermore, England and Japan abandoned the gold standard in 1931. The United States wants to use the old method of depreciated exchange rates to increase overseas trade, subdue England and Japan, and reverse the current economic decline with its high-end manufactured goods, which is extremely difficult. Therefore, the U.S. authorities have had no choice but to prepare for both war and peace policies. On the one hand, it has been trying to maintain its old attitude of abandoning the gold standard and temporarily not participating in international agreements on currency stability. On the other hand, it has been working hard to revitalize its domestic market and artificially stimulate the market, so that the general industry is on the road to prosperity. However, the unprecedented characteristics of this U.S. economic recovery plan, in addition to trying to avoid the anarchic production of capitalism, are as follows.</p>
<p>The first is to raise wages. Under the current system, individual interests have been at their peak for a time. All businesses are in favor of reducing wages and increasing working hours. During the panic period, this tendency is particularly obvious. However, in the U.S.'s recovery plan, raising wages has become one of the practical central tasks, and it is almost based on the understanding of the current situation and the examination of the economic structure. In the past, all capitalist countries have tried to overcome economic panic by maintaining the status quo of the industry, and all have tried to reduce wages in order to reduce their production costs and then compete in the market. After several years of doing so, the results have been verified, and those who understand have gradually realized that it is not a good plan. Moreover, the current situation in the Soviet Union is the only one that can transcend panic, and there is no other reason for it. It is nothing more than being able to base itself on the masses and implement its controlled economic policy. If the consumption capacity of the general public increases, then the pile-up of goods in warehouses will inevitably decrease, the disadvantages of overproduction will inevitably be eliminated, and economic panic will naturally subside. However, this increase in wages in the United States is still an unprecedented initiative.</p>
<p>Second, shortening working hours is also a major feature of the U.S. recovery plan. In the past, advanced countries in the various industrial sectors have tried to implement industrial rationalization, but they never advocated shortening working hours, so as to avoid damage to equipment and reduce production, resulting in business decline. However, the energy of the physical body is limited after all. The longer the working hours, the less concentrated its energy, and the worse the results. If working hours can be stopped appropriately, then the products produced will be better, and the results of the construction will be greater. Therefore, the United States, in its recovery plan, resolutely reversed what it had done before and shortened working hours. In addition, there is another reason, that is, to absorb more unemployed people.</p>
<p>However, all countries in the world are now engaged in economic nationalism, encouraging exports and opening up overseas markets to the outside world, and advocating the use of domestic products internally, blocking the import of foreign goods with tariffs and other methods. Major countries are also working hard to be self-sufficient. If this plan is fully implemented, where will overseas markets be sought? What room will there be for the development of nationalism? Then the re-division of existing markets is inevitable. We are surrounded by various countries. In terms of natural resources, we can be self-sufficient in terms of economic strength, but the environment cannot allow it. How will we protect ourselves?</p>

<p>Arrived in Hong Kong Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Plans to Establish Regular Mail and Passenger Flights</p>
<p>Five Stopover Points Planned</p>
<p>(Manila) Mr. Bixby, representative of Pan American Airways, who borrowed a China National Aviation Corporation plane to survey the air route between Hong Kong and Manila, completed his work this morning and returned to Shanghai. Before his departure, Bixby guaranteed to use specially built seaplanes to operate weekly passenger and mail flights between Shanghai and Manila. He stated that this plan has been mailed to the New York headquarters for approval. The content intends to imitate the South American air route method, setting up more stopover points to shorten the distance between two stations, so as to carry less fuel and avoid delays. He suggested that the company lease the entire island of Santiago in Lingayen Gulf as a refueling stopover station between northern Luzon and Manila. This survey found the island to be an excellent stopover point. In addition, a stopover station will also be set up on Dongsha Island, which is 200 miles from both Hong Kong and Manila. Building a refueling stopover station will not be very difficult. Pilots can avoid the risk of fog with this. If there is heavy fog near Hong Kong, the plane can wait on Dongsha Island until the fog clears, to ensure safety. The Dongsha Island area can practically be said to not encounter heavy fog year-round. Initially, one flight per week is planned. Once the business becomes profitable, the frequency of flights will be shortened. Currently, the Manila business community and the Philippine government are very enthusiastic about this initiative. Senator Mondilla has submitted a bill to the Legislative Assembly, granting Pan American Airways a 50-year franchise for the Manila-Hong Kong route. It is believed here that the Manila-Shanghai air route can be opened as soon as the two refueling stopover stations in Lingayen Gulf and Dongsha Island are built. The current plan is for five intermediate stopover points: Fuzhou, Hong Kong, Dongsha Island, Lake Pulai (northern Luzon), and Santiago Island (Lingayen Gulf). Mr. Bixby's plane departed from Cavite Airport here at 5:50 this morning, stopped at Santiago Island at 6:55 to refuel, and passed over Dongsha Island at 11:00. (3rd National Dispatch)</p>

<p>The United States Embarks on a Large-Scale Shipbuilding Plan</p>
<p>Japan Seeks to Complete the Second Supplementary Plan as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>(Tokyo) U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson has already begun a shipbuilding plan for thirty-seven ships and has signed the contracting agreements. Japanese naval authorities issued the following statement regarding this information: "When the U.S. shipbuilding had not yet begun, there was considerable doubt as to how much of it would actually be realized. Now that it has begun, it is clear that they intend to fill up to the limits of the London Treaty by 1936. Although the Yamato spirit is in Japan, sufficient strategic planning is necessary regarding the number of warships, needless to say. While both the United Kingdom and the United States are seeking to fill up to the 5:5:3 ratio or higher of naval power by 1936 and have begun shipbuilding today, Japan alone has not yet reached the ratio of 3, which is a cause for concern for national defense. Therefore, although the Navy is unwilling to compete in shipbuilding at a time when the national finances are under pressure, it is imperative to complete the shipbuilding plan up to the treaty limits by 1936. This is a matter of course. At the very least, it is necessary to achieve the second supplementary plan accounted for in next year's budget." (Japan Telecommunications News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to the estimates of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, if the total amount of the expenditure budget for next year is assumed to be 2 billion yen, the revenue will be short by approximately 732 million yen. If deductions are made for already established projects such as telecommunications, business bonds of approximately 30 million yen, and Manchurian Incident bonds of 100 million yen, the remaining amount will be approximately 602 million yen, which is purely a deficit bond. The basis for the revenue estimate is as follows: (1) Regular Department: 8.1291 (unit: million yen) for regular revenue in Showa 8th year. Hope to increase by 60.73 for tax and other government business revenue from the transfer of profits from the independent special accounting of telecommunications business, totaling 1.442. The deduction amount for postal, telegraph, and telephone revenue from the independent special accounting of telecommunications business is 240, resulting in a total difference of 1.184 for regular revenue. (2) Temporary Department: 28 for the balance of expenditure in Showa 8th year, 56 for the sale of government-owned property and other ordinary revenue, totaling 84. The total amount of ordinary revenue for both the regular and temporary departments is 1.268. (3rd Japan Telecommunications News Agency Dispatch)</p>

If this plan can be realized, the U.S. foreign trade can be increased by 40 to 60 million yuan. In addition, businesses that support the resumption of relations with Soviet Russia are strongly urging the government. Therefore, President Roosevelt will inevitably consider the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia soon. According to a report by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, approximately 200 commercial companies have requested loans to promote the sale of goods to Soviet Russia. The company intends to accept them. However, Soviet Russia has not yet ordered goods at present. The U.S. government knows well that Soviet Russia will not order goods from the U.S. before recognition. Secretary of State Hull said that the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia will be one of the first issues to be discussed after Roosevelt returns to the capital. People now express their strong support for recognition. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) During the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, all speakers mentioned racial issues, saying that the German government attaches great importance to this issue. When Rosenberg, the director of foreign affairs of the Nazi Party, gave a speech, he repeatedly explained the matter, saying that the foreign opponents of Hitlerism reject German goods because of the Jewish issue, which only increases the chaos of the world economy. After Rosenberg finished speaking, Propaganda Minister Goebbels took the stage and said that it is regrettable that Germany has resolved the Jewish issue with a fair attitude, and the world has commented on this matter. In addition to racial issues, Rosenberg and Goebbels also demanded equal rights for arms reduction and attacked the Treaty of Versailles. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nuremberg - 160,000 Nazi Party civil servants took the opportunity of the Nazi Party Congress to gather in Nuremberg today. Prime Minister Hitler delivered a speech, saying roughly: "It is your responsibility to instill the philosophy and politics you represent into the entire German people, regardless of their background or origin. Our party's organization does not know how to vote, and is only based on the principles of authority, discipline, and responsibility. All those who expect our party to disintegrate internally are in vain, because our party organization is strong. Since the enemy cannot achieve its goals through rebellion and riot, it turns to hoping for the internal disintegration and division of our party, but we have already obtained the key to close the door tightly, so that the enemies of the people can never take advantage of the opportunity to enter. Now that we are gathered here, twenty years, eighty years, or even a hundred years later, our party will still hold a congress in the same situation." (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

Shells, bullets, tanks, airplanes, poison gas, and other items are being mass-produced. The purpose of preparing for war is to recover the Polish Corridor and the Saar region. The "Sunday Chronicle" said that the major powers have received a lot of information about Germany's secret preparation for war, and it should be brought up for discussion at the Geneva Disarmament Conference.

It is said that the current situation requires a special governance plan, such as the immediate cessation of terrorist acts within and on the borders of Austria, etc. Austria acknowledged its willingness to dissolve this temporary army after one year of its establishment, if there was no prior agreement to extend its period of existence. British Foreign Secretary Simon replied last night, saying that the United Kingdom, in view of the temporary and special nature of this army, does not want to oppose the establishment of this army while this special situation exists.

<p>Reuters, Istanbul - Turkish Seiro Aghah, approximately 160 years old, known as the world's oldest man, heard news of the death of the Chinese longevity expert Li Qingyun, who lived to be 260 years old, this year, and was indignant, saying that the world's oldest man is no older than himself. Who can prove that Li lived to be 260 years old? Seiro's eleventh wife died of illness two months ago, but Seiro was still unwilling to live as a widower and wanted to find a woman around 70 years old as his wife, but things changed unexpectedly. Seiro is now sick in Istanbul and is in critical condition. According to the doctors, Seiro's body tissues have decayed and cannot be cured. Seiro traveled to Europe and the United States last year and earned a lot of money, but he has spent it all and is now poor and unable to make a living. The Istanbul city government, pitying him for his old age, gave him a monthly alimony of seven pounds, but it is said that it was canceled soon after it was given. Seiro has no fewer than 30 relatives in Istanbul. Since his illness began, none of them have gone to visit him. It is likely that philanthropists will come forward to raise donations so that this old man can receive proper care in his last days of life.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Washington, 2nd - Officials here say that U.S. President Roosevelt is now planning to ask Congress to grant him the power to negotiate special agreements with debtor countries to resolve war debts, so that future negotiations will not need to be discussed by Congress first. According to unverified news from government agencies, the United Kingdom hopes to reduce the total amount of its war debts by 90 percent. After the British Commissioner Reis Lothrop comes to the United States next month, this proposal will be the basis for discussion. The U.S. government firmly believes that this issue should be fairly resolved based on the specific circumstances of each debtor country. However, even if the U.S. Congress can grant the president the power to negotiate special agreements, it will have to be after January next year. As for how to deal with the installment due in mid-December this year, it is expected that there will be an indication next month.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At 3:00 PM on the 3rd, the Shandong flood disaster petition delegation hosted the press and dozens of fellow Shandong residents in Beijing at the Xiying Hotel. Zhang Weicun, Zhao Xinru, He Siyuan, Ge Xiangyi, Wang Zifeng of the delegation, and Cui Weiwu, a representative of fellow Shandong residents in Beijing, reported successively. First, they explained the cause of the flood, saying that it was not due to the Shandong Province's poor river defenses. In the past 15 years, the Yellow River has breached its banks six times, all in Henan and Hebei provinces. Although the people of Shandong have exhausted manpower and financial resources to prevent it this time, they are inevitably suffering from floods because they are located downstream, which is really painful. Then, they said that the spring wheat in the disaster-stricken counties was completely washed away, and the autumn sorghum and beans were also submerged and could not be harvested. If the breaches in the upper reaches are not blocked recently, the wheat cannot be planted, and there is no hope for a wheat harvest next year. The people of western Shandong are fierce and unruly. Yuncheng Nanwang Lake is the former Liangshanbo. There are many firearms among the people. If no measures are taken in time, the disaster victims will become bandits, and the consequences will be worrying. The central government has decided to allocate 4 million in disaster relief funds for distribution to the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Henan and Hebei are located in the upper reaches, and the disaster-stricken counties are not as numerous as those in Shandong Province. The people of Shandong hope that the central government will distribute the disaster relief funds based on the severity of the disaster, so that it can be fair. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the agreement signed between the former government of Xinjiang Province and Soviet Russia, some people say that the contents of the secret agreement include commerce, territory, and transportation, and that Aisa has copied the entire text and sent it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the General Staff for reference. It is heard that a certain organization decided to convene responsible personnel tomorrow to study it in detail after receiving the letter. However, according to those who are familiar with the diplomatic situation, the New Russian local agreement was tentatively discussed during Yang Zengxin's time. Later, it was signed during Jin Shuren's tenure. China and Russia mutually sent five consuls, which may be this local agreement. There should be no secret agreement other than this, because the Soviet Constitution has no secret agreement relationship with any country. Although the sale of the China Eastern Railway by Soviet Russia has been suspended, our diplomatic authorities, in order to maintain sovereignty and fulfill the treaty, will naturally strive for it according to law and will not give up their rights. During the immature stage of the consultations between the Russian and puppet parties, they will temporarily maintain a wait-and-see attitude and will soon declare to the world in accordance with international law, reserving the rights that our country should obtain and not allowing their illegal acts.

Liu Jiwen and others will also leave the province and are currently in a stalemate. (2) Since Zou Lu was attacked and resigned as the president of Zhongshan University, Xiao Guanying is temporarily acting as the president. Because Guangdong has always been disobedient to the central government, the orders of the Ministry of Education are also out of reach. (3) For the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang to be convened in Beijing on November 12, all Central Committee members from various places, except those who are responsible for guarding their garrisons and cannot leave far away, can come to Beijing to attend because they appreciate the importance of national affairs. Some Central Committee members from Guangdong can come to Beijing, so it will definitely exceed the legal quorum at that time. (4) Although there have been rumors that Guangdong has borrowed money from Japan, it is understood that this is not the case. Recently, Chen Jitang purchased 36 new aircrafts to expand the air force. As for Guangdong Province's plan to issue public bonds, it is heard that it is still under consideration. (5) The southwest is indeed working hard to suppress the bandits.

<p>=Japanese Troops Refuse to Return Tianjin-Taierzhuang Communications Cables=</p>
<p>=Japanese Troops Still Occupy Luanyu Section to Transport Grain to Rehe=</p>
<p>=Travelers Between Tangshan and Luanyu Repeatedly Searched by Japanese Troops=</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence: Liu Shirun, a member of the War Zone Receiving Committee, recently went to Tianjin to negotiate with the Japanese garrison regarding traffic in eastern Luan and the return of buildings occupied by the Japanese army. He returned to Beiping yesterday afternoon. According to Liu, "Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao were the first to be impacted. When Shimenzhai and Haiyangzhen were tense, the Tianjin garrison headquarters and the Qinhuangdao garrison used telegrams to report news at any time. There are three types of Chinese telegraph lines between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao: (1) ordinary long-distance lines, (2) telegraph lines, and (3) special lines for the Beining Railway. The Beiping authorities inquired about the front-line situation at any time, and the Japanese army stationed in Qinhuangdao also used these three types of lines at will. When our army withdrew from Ludong, the Beining Railway only went to Tanggu, and the three types of telegraph lines between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao became the property of the Japanese. Now that the Tanggu Agreement has been signed and we are taking back the lost territories, everything is generally completed, but the Japanese army still uses our telegraph lines to transmit news and has not returned them. We feel very inconvenient that the lost territories have been taken back, but the telephone and telegraph lines between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao have not been recovered. Moreover, foreign nationals in Beidaihe need to use the phone to transmit messages at any time, and they often complain about this. In order to reorganize the postal and telegraphic affairs after taking back the lost territories, the Ministry of Communications recently sent a technician to Beiping to discuss the matter and request the Japanese side to return the lines in accordance with the agreement in order to reorganize them, restore them to their original state, and facilitate transportation. I went to Tianjin from Beiping a few days ago to negotiate with the Japanese garrison in charge. According to the Boxer Protocol, the Japanese army is stationed along the Beining Railway, but there are no dedicated telephone lines along the line, and news from various places must be reported at any time. After negotiations, the Japanese army agreed to return all the occupied lines. After continued discussion, two long-distance round-trip lines dedicated to the Beining Railway were temporarily borrowed by the Japanese side. Both sides sent an engineer to start inspecting and repairing the lines, and one of the Beining Railway phone lines was selected to be repaired quickly for use. All telegrams must pass through the Luan River Railway Bridge. When He Jun (Zhu Guo) retreated during the war, the bridge was bombed and the telegraph lines were broken, and the line poles were tilted. Later, wooden poles were temporarily used to suspend the lines. We are now preparing to repair the telegraph lines here to avoid future failures. Also, after our army retreated along the railway line, the Japanese army followed up and occupied many houses along the line. During this negotiation, the Japanese army withdrew from Shanhaiguan. The garrison had occupied the staff quarters of the Tangshan Beining Railway Engineering Office and part of the Luan County Telegraph Bureau, which had not yet been returned. During this negotiation, the Japanese side agreed to return them, but the withdrawal and takeover of the Japanese army and the puppet government agencies in Lin Yu County are still not completed, and negotiations have not yet begun. Luan Dong and the area along the Great Wall have always been a den of bandits. After the war, they have become increasingly rampant. After taking over the lost territories in Luan Dong and northern Beiping, we sent police, but their strength is weak, and the bandits are rampant and unscrupulous. According to statistics from various counties, the number of bandits is close to 200,000. However, according to investigations, although the bandits in various counties are rampant, they do not have the ability to unite. The people suffer unspeakable harm. In the future, suppressing them will require further negotiations with the Japanese side to formulate a comprehensive and concrete plan and send troops to carry out strict suppression in order to fundamentally solve the problem. However, the number of bandits is large and widespread. How to solve this problem and whether to find a way to make them surrender will depend on Chairman Yu (Xuezhong) after he arrives in Ji. There will be a solution. I will go to Tianjin again in three to five days."</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Yin Tong, a member of the War Zone Receiving Committee, "The Japanese army in Luandong plans to transport military grain from Shanhaiguan to Rehe before the river freezes in winter. They are borrowing the railway from Shanhaiguan to Luanxian and leaving a small number of troops along the railway to protect the military transportation. We have contacted the Japanese side several times regarding the troop stationing issue and the Japanese army's use of vehicles hindering our traffic. It has now been decided that the Japanese army will only transport one train of grain per day until Hebei freezes. The freight will be temporarily recorded, and the Japanese troops along the route will also withdraw at that time. The reorganization of the puppet army in Yu Tian County has not yet been completed. It is still commanded by Hu Xie Wu. Dong Tianhua, the former county magistrate of that county, was beaten and insulted by the soldiers of that unit and left the county to report to the provincial government in Tianjin. The unit has now dismissed Zhang Qingxin, the officer in charge, and more than twenty soldiers responsible for the incident and expelled them. Hu Xie Wu and the local chamber of commerce have repeatedly telegraphed County Magistrate Dong to urge him to return to his post. Wei Jian, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, summoned Dong yesterday for instructions. Dong is scheduled to return to Yutian today (31st) to resume his post. Regarding the suppression of bandits in Luandong, due to the ceasefire agreement, our army is not allowed to directly send troops into Luandong to suppress bandits, and the security force is weak, resulting in rampant bandits. This matter can be resolved after Chairman Huang and Chairman Yu return to the north."</p>
<p>Yesterday, someone from Shanhaiguan talked about what he saw along the way after the opening of the Ping-Yu section of the Beining Railway. He said, "Shanhaiguan is the junction of the Ping-Yu section and the puppet Anfeng Railway. Passengers from both sides change trains here. Passengers getting off the puppet railway and planning to take the Ping-Yu train west must get off here. Japanese military police and puppet police inspect and search Chinese passengers one by one. The situation is extremely serious. Japanese and Korean passengers are allowed to pass without being searched. Passengers getting off the Ping-Yu train to take the puppet Anfeng train are checked even more strictly. After boarding the Ping-Yu train, at stations such as Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Luanxian, and Tangshan, only Japanese military police change shifts and escort the train. However, at all stations along the way, Japanese military police board the train and patrol. If they encounter anyone resembling a soldier, they will interrogate them. After arriving at Lutai, our cavalry is stationed at the station and only boards the train to inspect. The interrogation situation is more relaxed than that of the Japanese military police. East of Tangshan, Japanese peddlers who specialize in selling prohibited items such as Jin Dan and morphine, as well as Japanese prostitutes, are extremely prevalent. All sovereignty is still in the hands of the Japanese. The so-called Ping-Yu through train is no different from traveling on borrowed land. The guest also said that in the Luandong area, because our sovereignty has not been fully recovered, bandits are rampant and causing disturbances, especially in the Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe areas. It is said that there are about 20,000 bandits, led by the bandit leader 'Old Mouse'. The Beining Railway Security Team is currently concentrated between Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe to protect the route. When the train arrives at the Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe stations, the security team stationed there will board the locomotive for protection. In the other carriages, there are more than three security team members protecting the train. The seriousness of the situation is enough to make passengers tremble. However, the order on the coast of Beidaihe is still stable. There are still more than a dozen Westerners staying there for summer vacation. The security there is the responsibility of Li Baozhen, the vice president of the Gongli Society. The president is still concurrently the director of the Beining Railway Bureau." (September 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Suiyuan Also Reports Flooding <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>=Many Canals in Various Counties Are Destroyed=</p>
<p>=The Situation Is Serious and There Is No Hope for the Autumn Harvest=</p>
<p>Suiyuan Correspondence: Suiyuan in recent years can truly be said to have had natural disasters and man-made disasters one after another. The great drought of the 17th and 18th years of the Republic left the countryside in ruins after the famine. Selling wives and children was extremely tragic for a time. Last year, there was a gradual turnaround, but the low price of millet hurt farmers, and it turned into a strange phenomenon of "harvesting into disaster". This year, due to continuous rain and torrential mountain floods, the counties along the river have become flooded again, with submerged fields, collapsed houses, and the deaths of people and livestock, which is quite serious. The worst are Baotou, Salaqi County, and Tuoketuo County. There are also signs of disaster in the Hetao and Wulin areas. There is no hope for the autumn harvest, and relief is urgently needed. The arrival of Sun Dianying's army and the gathering of large troops have also created supply difficulties. The formation of this flood was caused by the destruction of many canals in various counties. For example, the Salaqi-Tuoketuo Minsheng Canal has not been released since the gate was opened. This project was severely damaged, with losses in the hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Yihe Canal in Zhungeer Banner in Tuoketuo County was breached, the canal body was completely destroyed, and the Minli Canal in Tuoketuo County was also affected. The breach of the cart dam has widened the flooded area. It has always emphasized water conservancy, but today it has been harmed by water, which was also unexpected. The formation of the flood in Salaqi County was originally due to torrential mountain floods, which were blocked by the Minsheng Canal. The water was blocked by the canal back that stretched from east to west and had nowhere to be discharged, so the villages on the north bank were submerged. Later, the north bank of the Minsheng Canal was destroyed, and the water flowed south, and the south bank was also destroyed, and the disaster area became larger. All the way to Tuoketuo County, water puddles hundreds of miles long and thirty, twenty, ten, or eight miles wide are everywhere, and they are all vast and have become Ze country. The west of the county seat of Tuoketuo County is close to the Heihe River. Decades ago, there were often Guan Polan, so the river embankment was repaired every year and was extremely strong. The willows lined up on the embankment are all decades of growth. In the past twenty years, the small river near the city has almost dried up, and even the Yellow River has been cut off. Therefore, building embankments is no longer necessary, and the trees on the embankment were cut down a few years ago. The trees were sold by the local government and government offices, and the roots were dug up by the poor to burn as firewood. Although new trees have been embellished every year in recent years, unfortunately, none have survived. Therefore, the river embankment was destroyed, and the river bank was loose. This year, the river water suddenly rose, and the people were caught off guard. A few days ago, a drama was performed in the River God Temple for three days, but it was still impossible to celebrate Anlan forever. The county government urged the people to build embankments and guarded them day and night. Residents living near the river tore down houses to block the water, and finally the county seat was able to survive, but the disaster in the villages west of the river was extremely severe. In recent days, Baotou, Salaqi County, and Tuoketuo County have been rushing to the provincial government to ask for relief. The situation is summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e68">Baotou <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The fourth district of Baotou suffered the most severe disaster. On August 16th and 17th, the water came like a tide, breaking through the walls from Dongda Shetubao and entering the area like a mountain falling. The people were unable to prevent it, causing the houses in the fort to be submerged. Because it was daytime, the people were awakened and ran to the northwest corner of the high mound to take temporary refuge. After the water receded, the people in the fort were homeless. Thousands of people were starving and sleeping in the open, and the situation was extremely tragic. Regarding the losses, this one fort was flooded with more than 70 houses, more than 3,000 stones of grain, and hundreds of cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep. The crops outside the fort were silted up by the sand. More than 3,000 farmers, men, women, old and young, are now sleeping on the beach without clothes or food, crying from hunger and cold day and night. The Baotou County Government has telegraphed the provincial government to request emergency relief. The climate in Suiyuan Province is cold, and it has been very cold in recent days. It is feared that people will freeze and starve.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Salaqi County <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The disaster in Salaqi County is the most serious. The county seat is almost a Ze country. There are more than a hundred villages surrounded by water. Mountain water has erupted everywhere, and the Yellow River flows north. The area is the widest. What was usually land in the past must now be traveled by boat. In villages with walled castles, the lives of the people can still be protected. In villages without walled castles, it is unimaginable if the rescue is not timely. In the most urgent time, in Dadaicun Village, more than a thousand villagers were using all their strength to seize the dam every day. There are many places where boats are traveling near the Sui-Bao Railway, such as Daxiaoeergexuncun, Gongjiban, and Taosihai.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Tuoketuo County <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The villages west of the county seat of Tuoketuo County are completely submerged. County Magistrate Chen Yingdao recently reported to the provincial government, saying, "The river floods have risen sharply and flooded the area. The eight villages in Hexi Station area in the first district and the villages of Nanyaozi and Liangjianfang in the second district were submerged one after another. The number of people and livestock drowning in the water is countless. Those who have barely escaped have no place to eat during the day and no place to sleep at night. They are carrying their children and dragging their daughters, dragging mud and water, and crying from hunger and cold. It is unbearable to hear." This is the truth. He asked the provincial government for emergency relief. The provincial government is facing many difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Chiang Orders Xu Yuanquan, Et Al., to Be Responsible for Capturing and Executing Bandit Leaders <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>=He Long's Bandits in Western Hubei Occupy Songzi=</p>
<p>=Local Bandits in Eastern Hubei Disturb Huangma=</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Long's remaining bandits in western Hubei suddenly set off from near Yuyangguan on the 25th of last month and captured Songzi County. County Magistrate Jiang Wenbo was killed. The bandits also have the potential to invade Jingzhou and Shashi. Songzi County is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River. It was originally called Mopanshi and moved here not long ago. It faces Shashi and Jiangling across the river. Because there are no heavy troops stationed there, the local defense force is also very weak. This was detected by the bandits, who took advantage of the opportunity to invade. County Magistrate Jiang led the local defense force to fight back, but they were defeated due to being outnumbered. Jiang was brutally killed by the bandits, and many people were also harmed. After capturing Songzi, the bandits tried to cross the river and take advantage of the victory. There were about two or three thousand bandits. Xu Yuanquan had just returned to Shashi from Hankou and immediately sent a large army to suppress them in several directions after receiving the report. The bandits could not withstand the pressure and retreated in panic. It is reported that Songzi City has now been recovered and the remaining bandits are being searched for. The provincial government received a telegram from Xu one day, saying that the county magistrate of Songzi County was brutally killed by the bandits and that no one was in charge of the county. The people were shaken and hoped that the provincial government would send a cadre to come quickly to stabilize the situation and reassure the people. The provincial government discussed the matter and decided to appoint Wang Wanjia, the county secretary of the county, to act as the agent temporarily and telegraphed Xu to inform him.</p>
<p>In the Huangma area of eastern Hubei, bandits have now invaded again. It seems that they are the main force of the bandits. Liu Zhenhua has ordered Sun Lianzhong, Wan Yaohuang, and Peng Zhenshan to jointly suppress them and has reported to Commander-in-Chief Chiang to transfer Li Yutang's Third Division stationed in northern Henan to assist. They will disembark in Xiaogan and march on foot towards Huangma. Chiang telegraphed Xu Yuanquan, Liu Zhenhua, and Chen Jicheng on the 2nd, assigning Xu to capture and execute He Long, the bandit leader in western Hubei; Chen to capture and execute Zhang Tao and Ye Jinbo, the bandit leaders in southern Hubei; and Liu to capture and execute Shen Zemin, Lu Huanxian, and Liao Rongkun, the bandit leaders in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, in order to eliminate the major criminals and eliminate the bandit scourge. If the bandit leaders are not captured, even if the bandits are cleared, it will not be considered a complete task. (September 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Zhang Qun Goes to Hunan to Meet He Jian <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>=To Discuss the Aftermath of the Bandit Area in Southern Hubei and Investigate Hunan Politics=</p>
<p>=The Provincial Government Organizes a Provincial County Government Inspection Team=</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhang Qun, chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, believes that the political affairs facilities in Hunan and Hubei are closely related. At the beginning of his appointment, he planned to go to Hunan to discuss everything with He Jian, chairman of Hunan. Later, when Zhang went to Lushan to meet Chiang Kai-shek, he received a telegram from He, saying that the aftermath of the bandit area in southern Hubei urgently needed to be discussed in person. He had originally planned to come to Hubei for advice, but he was unable to do so due to a slight illness. He especially requested Zhang to visit Hunan. Zhang replied that he would agree. Recently, the National Society of Engineers held its third annual meeting in Wuchang. Hu Shuhua, director of the Hunan Construction Department, came to Hubei to attend the meeting and was ordered by He to visit Zhang and urge him to go. Zhang and Li Fanyi, director of the Construction Department, and Cheng Qibao, director of the Education Department, took a special train on the Hunan-Hubei Railway south at 5:00 p.m. on the 1st. Feng Fei, secretary of the provincial government, accompanied him. It is said that the mission of this trip, in addition to discussing the aftermath of the bandit area in southern Hubei, also includes discussing water conservancy issues, such as dredging rivers and lakes, and requesting the central government to approve the plans. They will also inspect the administrative, construction, education, Qingxiang, and Baojia facilities in Hunan Province, as well as the rural conditions, for Hubei Province to learn from. It is planned to stay in Hunan for five days and then return to Hubei. During the period of going to Hunan, all provincial government affairs will be handled by Lu Zhu, the commissioner and secretary-general. The Hubei provincial government has been planning the aftermath of the bandit area and has decided to allocate 100,000 yuan to southern Hubei, eastern Hubei, and western Hubei. The headquarters has approved the record. The county government inspection in each county has also been decided. The provincial government, the four departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, and education, and the security department will each send five people to form the "Hubei Provincial County Government Inspection Team." The province will be divided into five inspection areas: east, west, south, north, and central. The team will depart in groups, first going to the three areas of eastern Hubei, western Hubei, and southern Hubei, where banditry is more rampant, and then to the two areas of northern Hubei and central Hubei. The scope of the inspection includes: (1) civil affairs facilities, (2) financial revenue and expenditure, (3) construction progress, (4) education situation, (5) training of security teams, (6) general situation of Baojia household registration, and (7) local customs and people's hardships, etc. It is planned to formulate various plans based on the inspection reports to be the goal of implementing new policies. This work can be completed in one and a half months. (September 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Record of a Trip to Shandong <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Because the reporter participated in the 10th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society, I traveled by sea to Qingdao. After the meeting, I toured Jinan and Tai'an, then took the Jinpu and Jinghu railway lines back to Shanghai. What I heard and saw on this trip is worth recounting, so I will record one or two aspects below:</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Shuming has dedicated himself to the rural construction movement in Shandong in recent years, and is well-known to the world. The Economic Society invited him to speak at the meeting, and his topic was "The Special Difficulties in Solving China's Economic Problems." His main idea was that China only has two economic paths forward: 1) The government effectively maintains order and security in all regions, and the economy is left to free competition and free development by the people; 2) In addition to maintaining order and security, the government further develops industries and implements a controlled economy. Although both paths are viable, considering China's current situation, foreign economic forces have already deeply penetrated the interior. If the government can only maintain security and order, the result of free competition in the economy will be that foreign economic forces will increasingly dominate, and China's nascent agricultural and industrial sectors will be overwhelmed by foreign forces and cannot avoid the misfortune of bankruptcy. Therefore, if we take the first path, the future is very dangerous. As for the second path, it is naturally more in line with China's current situation, but it requires the government to be healthier, more powerful, and more transparent to even discuss it. Otherwise, it is no different from quenching thirst by looking at plums. Today's political conditions in China are truly inadequate. We cannot even achieve the first path, let alone take a further step to implement a controlled economy. From this, it is clear that seeking an economic way out today faces special difficulties. The crux of these difficulties lies in the unresolved political problems. Therefore, those who discuss economic problems and study economic plans today must pay attention to political problems. Moreover, the occurrence of economic problems each has its special social circumstances as a background. Therefore, in discussing economic plans, in addition to paying attention to political problems, one must also deeply understand the individuality of all aspects of society. Only in this way can all economic plans be relevant and effective. Otherwise, even with plans, they will be nothing more than castles in the air.</p>
<p>After the speech, Mr. Liang had a private conversation with the reporter. He said, "What troubles China the most now is that whether individuals, groups, local or central authorities, all are bound and oppressed by the environment, eking out a living in contradictions, so that all strength is mostly consumed in useless places. If this situation does not change, the vitality of each person cannot be fully developed." Furthermore, he said, "The progress of society and the evolution of the country depend on the development of each person's life force. Now that our people cannot fully develop their inherent life force, it is a major reason why all undertakings are not easy to progress." Also, "China's society is a rural economic society, so all construction undertakings and economic plans must start from the rural aspect. The solution to China's problems lies in the solution to rural problems." This is a view that Mr. Liang firmly believes in. When discussing rural issues, the rural economic situation in Shandong Province can serve as a valuable reference. I will now provide a brief report to the readers:</p>
<p>Peanuts are an important agricultural product in Shandong Province. In the past, if a farming family had ten or eight mu of land to plant peanuts, they could live comfortably for a year. These peanuts were shipped to the United States to make peanut oil and sold everywhere. Now, due to the world economic panic and the decline of all industries, peanut sales are also greatly sluggish, and prices are half of what they used to be. Therefore, all farming families who plant peanuts are in danger of bankruptcy. This is a major blow to the rural economy in Shandong Province. Wheat is also an important agricultural product in Shandong Province. Now that the US wheat loan has been completed, there is also a fear of wheat sales being sluggish in Shandong. It is said that for this reason, the farmers are mostly worried.</p>
<p>Japanese merchants in various parts of China recently elected representatives two weeks ago to hold a commercial joint meeting in Qingdao. The purpose was to promote the sales of Japanese goods in China. It is said that one of the resolutions was "We must find ways to make Chinese transportation agencies abolish differential treatment for Chinese and Japanese goods." Many Japanese goods, such as matches, are in a competitive position with those made in our country. Because they have sufficient capital and better technology, the cost of these goods is low, and they already have an advantage in sales. If this resolution of the Japanese is achieved, it will be easier to dump their goods, and goods made in our country will be more affected. Yesterday, a friend talked about this, saying that Japan and the Northeast puppet state under Japanese influence are almost using their entire strength to deal with self-made products in China. However, industries in North China each act on their own and rarely have a spirit of unity and cooperation, let alone concentrate their efforts to compete with foreign countries. Therefore, the commercial crisis in North China is actually no less than the agricultural economic crisis. Qingdao is a good ice-free port in Shandong, and although there is much room for future development, the Japanese are ambitious and are using this as a center for dumping Japanese goods in various parts of North China. As a reporter traveling through this place, I cannot help but feel anxious.</p>

<p>Nanchang special dispatch: Our country is established on agriculture, and the total number of farmers accounts for more than 78% of the total population of the country, and the national economy is also completely based on the rural economy. However, in recent years, due to the deep invasion of international capitalism from the outside, and the alternating cycle of natural and man-made disasters from the inside, the rural economy has tended to collapse fundamentally. As a result, the great waves that have arisen and will arise in society all take this as the main force for turbulence. This is probably because farmers have established their extremely important position in society in terms of their large numbers and production relations. The reporter inspected Jiangxi Province for half a month, passed through more than 20 counties, and conducted rural surveys in half of them. Now, I will briefly describe the general situation of production in Jiangxi Province, as follows:</p>
<p>According to the report of the "Domestic Rural Improvement Project Inspection Team" of the province, the total area of cultivated land in the province is about 40 million mu, and there are about 3 million farming households. Each farming household can obtain an average of 13 mu. The annual output of major crops is more than 84 million dan of rice, timber is worth about 8 million yuan, tea is more than 200,000 boxes. In addition, cotton, peppermint, camphor, tea oil, beans, etc., because there are no detailed surveys and statistics, the exact figures are not yet known. Handicrafts such as porcelain, the annual output is worth about 10 million yuan, summer cloth is about 5 million yuan, paper is about 8 million yuan, and mineral products such as tungsten in various counties in southern Jiangxi, coal in Pingxiang Yugan and other counties, and iron in Yongxin Jiujiang and other counties, occupy an important position in the production of the province. The output of tungsten accounts for 80% of the national output and half of the world's output. Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, production has gradually declined. In the 20th year, the province's exports were only worth 17 million taels, while the imports in the same year were as high as 41 million taels. Last year's summer cloth production was only about 30% of the usual level, and tea losses were estimated at more than 1 million yuan. Compared with the 16th year of the Republic of China, porcelain production decreased by more than 4 million yuan, and the production and sales of paper have plummeted. During the flood two years ago, a large amount of Saigon rice was shipped from Shanghai, and the supply of flour was entirely imported. With the drastic reduction in productivity and the sudden increase in the number of unemployed people, the strong risk and the weak turn to the ditches. Among the counties in the province, only more than 20 counties such as Nanchang and Xinjian are free from bandits. In addition, more than 50 counties have suffered from banditry. Those who have suffered the most have been left with barren fields and villages in ruins. This is enough to see the general collapse of the countryside.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an analysis of the individual status of the tranquil areas, the semi-bandit areas, and the bandit areas: 1) Tranquil areas: on the surface, it seems that people can live and work in peace and contentment, but in essence, due to the great impact of the so-called scissors-shaped price of selling agricultural products at low prices and purchasing industrial products at high prices, as a result, various agricultural and industrial products in the past five years have not been able to make ends meet, the burden has become heavier, and the losses have increased. One has to sell his land. Therefore, most farmers have become tenant farmers, and tenant farmers have become hired laborers. Under the opposing development of capitalism and pre-capital, pre-capital will inevitably decline, that is, the small-scale peasant economy will inevitably collapse, and the situation of increasing land concentration and increasing poverty of small farmers will be formed. However, the small farmers suffer greatly from the low prices of agricultural products, but the landlords do not make much progress. In addition, the taxes and duties are heavy, and both landlords and tenants feel the pain of being unable to compensate for their losses. Occasionally, there are those who flee to other places and leave their fields barren. 2) Semi-bandit areas: First, due to the social instability and the low prices of agricultural products, the rich are afraid of chaos and fly away. Although farmers and small and medium-sized landlords want to avoid chaos, they have no way to sell their land and have to stick to their homeland. Large landlords and hired laborers are more mobile, that is, they can easily flee to other places. The percentage of self-cultivating farmers seems to have increased relatively. Moreover, because no one buys land, the land is not concentrated. The landlords cannot take care of the land. In order to have some income rather than nothing, they have to improve the conditions of tenancy and try to rent out the land. The small and medium-sized self-cultivating farmers are also very willing to cultivate this land with better conditions in order to make up for the loss of the collapse of their side business. However, in the end, the big problems of "cultivation may not yield a harvest" and "harvest may not be sold at a good price" linger in their minds. They often reduce fertilizer and labor, and maintain the mentality of letting the land produce on its own. As a result, the output decreases sharply, fertile land becomes barren land, and small pieces of wasteland gradually increase. At the same time, rural finance flows out invisibly to stable commercial areas, and even if farmers want to borrow at high interest rates, no one dares to lend money. 3) Bandit areas: The degree of destruction in the areas of military and bandit wars is truly a wilderness. If it is a guerrilla zone, that is, a place where the main forces of the army and bandits do not directly confront each other, there are small groups of bandits that come and go from time to time. Ignorant farmers are often attracted. It is uncertain whether the land is cultivated. Only life and property are extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Government organized a domestic rural improvement project inspection team. In November last year, it sent Wang Zhenxin and others to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei and other provinces to inspect the rural improvement project. It took several months before they returned to Jiangxi. Recently, Wang initiated the organization of the Jiangxi Rural Improvement Society in order to contact comrades and implement improvement measures to the countryside. I recently visited Wang, and we talked for a long time about his feelings about the inspection of rural improvement projects in various places and the Jiangxi rural improvement plan. According to the talk, I (Wang's self-proclaimed) led the inspection team to various provinces to inspect the rural improvement projects, and I believe that the rural projects in various places seem to have their special characteristics. Among them, there are many projects that focus on education as the center, and there are also those that simultaneously carry out various aspects of politics and economy. However, due to different subjective opinions, some only focus on Eastern culture and ignore the background of the times, and some only pay attention to domestic factors and forget the economic aggression of foreign countries. However, on the whole, they can fully express their enthusiasm and spirit of sacrifice for rural projects. This is the best impression I have gained. The Jiangxi countryside is already on the verge of complete collapse. After I came back from the inspection, I had some ideas on the rural improvement in our province, namely: 1) The situation of the collapse of the Jiangxi countryside is different from that in other places, and the rescue methods cannot be completely imitated from other places. 2) Rural improvement should focus on the rural economy, and rural organizations, rural education, etc. should also advance simultaneously. In other words, in order to pull the farmers back from the bandit areas and prevent the counties that have not been affected by banditry from being infected, we must give the farmers practical benefits, help them to be self-reliant, and establish the foundation of the rural economy. Then all other undertakings can be carried out smoothly, and the means to achieve the improvement of the rural economy is to use political power to develop the economy, and then popularize education and promote politics through economic development. Therefore, it is currently planned to first conduct various experimental work in the experimental areas of rural improvement, and then universally promote the results.</p>

<p>The Typhoon and Rain Affect the Crops</p>
<p>For nearly half a month in the county, thunderstorms have fallen from time to time, and the phenomenon of severe drought has changed to good weather. The crops are developing rapidly. If there are no special changes, there will be a very good harvest this winter, and the farmers are extremely happy. Unexpectedly, a hurricane suddenly rose the day before yesterday, passing through the county. Yesterday morning (3rd), the wind was even stronger and heavy rain fell. The ditches were full and the climate was gloomy and cold. It is said that if the hurricane and rain do not stop, the future of the crops will be affected.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Stopping the Opening and Relocation of New Cocoon Exchanges <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>This autumn cocoon market is scheduled to open scales today (4th). There are a total of ten cocoon markets that have reported to open in the past few days. Yesterday, eighteen more, including Lu Hengyi, Ruichangsheng, Shunchang, Hexing, and Yongda, reported to open. Including the previous ones, there are a total of twenty-eight. It is expected that there will be a large number of reports to open today or tomorrow. The county government of this county received instructions from the provincial government yesterday, roughly stating that the cocoon market in this province has been open with no restrictions in principle since the 18th year of the Republic of China. The "Provisional Cocoon Market Regulations of Jiangsu Province" were promulgated, allowing each county to establish cocoon markets. The number of cocoon markets is almost twice as many as before the opening, and the output of autumn cocoons has also increased year by year. However, because the local species are gradually being eliminated, the output of spring cocoons has not increased. The cocoon markets in various counties are inevitably oversupplied. Also, the silk industry in this province has adopted new machines to improve various silk-making technologies. Therefore, the former Department of Agriculture and Mines had already advocated the elimination of old cocoon markets and promoted the establishment of new-style cocoon drying machines to fundamentally improve the silk industry. Now, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, the original provisional cocoon regulations should be revised. However, the opening of this year's autumn cocoon market is approaching, and there is not enough time for revision. Before the revision, all requests to open new and relocate cocoon markets will be temporarily suspended to avoid disputes. After Strict County Chief received the order, he has now complied with it.</p>

<p>Beiwang and Xiqian villages in the ninth district of the county were suddenly attacked by 20 to 30 bandits at 12 am the day before yesterday. They were armed with box guns and rifles, spoke with a Cang-Fu accent, and poured into the villages to search every household without exception. The two villages were robbed of a lot of silver dollars, clothing and jewelry, and more than 400 shi of rice was stolen, and five civilian boats were taken away. It is reported that the losses were huge.</p>

<p>Typhoons Wreaked Havoc Over the Past Two Days</p>
<p>This county has suffered from insect plagues, and the people are unable to make a living. Last year, they were also affected by the low price of grain. Therefore, the farmers in the countryside all hope that this year's autumn harvest will be slightly better, so that they can survive. Unexpectedly, there have been typhoons and heavy rains day and night over the past two days. At this time, the drought-resistant rice is forming ears, and it has suffered a great loss due to the typhoon. Although the late rice sown by the migrants has all turned into grain, it has been blown down by the wind. Because of the accumulated water in the fields, it has all sprouted. The general farmers are all crying out in pain when they see this disaster. As for the collapse of houses and the overturning of boats, it is even more difficult to estimate.</p>

<p>After the Supreme Court sent the case of Tao Jinzi, a female student of the West Lake Art School, who brutally killed her classmate Liu Ying, back to the Zhejiang Provincial High Court for retrial, Tao Jinzi was sentenced to life imprisonment and Xu Gewen was acquitted. Subsequently, Tao and Xu were summoned for a communist case, and Xu was detained in a military prison. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against Tao and Xu for allegedly endangering the Republic of China. It is learned that Tao Jinzi's side stated that the ten-day period after the delivery of the judgment has expired, and Tao herself and her family members do not intend to appeal. However, prosecutor Ji Gengyang believed that Tao Jinzi had premeditated murder by turning off the lights and hiding them in her coat pocket, and asking the maid Chen Zhu to go out to buy Snow White Cream and lock the door. Xu Qinwen, as a man, allowed Liu Mengying, a girl under the age of 20, to stay overnight, which clearly showed an intention to commit adultery, which constituted a crime against the family. Yesterday (2nd), he specially appealed to the Supreme Court in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Jin Yuchun, a physiology and hygiene teacher at Huilan Middle School in Shipalou, Hangzhou, is 33 years old, from Jinjiazhan, Zhuji. His family is well-off. His father is dead, and his mother is alive. His wife, Feng, has three sons, the eldest and youngest are at home. The second son, named Jin Zhu, was brought to Hangzhou by his father and is studying in the affiliated elementary school of the school. Jin is quite loyal, but he is short and is often ridiculed by others when he goes out. Therefore, Jin thought he was humiliated and had the idea of committing suicide last winter. Because he was detected early, he was able to be treated. Unexpectedly, after the school started on the 1st of this month, Jin also worked as usual, but his attitude was suddenly different. He often said to people, "Hangzhou people are paying attention to me, even rickshaw drivers are looking at me," and so on. Yesterday (3rd) at 8 am, Wang Yinian, the accounting director of the school, became suspicious because he had not seen Jin eating breakfast. He went to the bedroom to look and saw Jin lying down with his clothes on, his face was gray. He knew that he had taken poison. He hurriedly asked the school doctor Wang Jimin to come to the school for treatment. Because he had taken too much poison, he had already died. Principal Xu Yue, in addition to reporting the case to the court, also sent someone to Zhuji to inform the family members to come to Hangzhou to take care of the matter.</p>

<p>Shi Juefei, a youth from Zhengyangguan, Northern Anhui, was born into poverty and received secondary education. He has lived in Bengbu for several years. Last year, he was introduced by someone to work as a teacher at the Third Yiwu Elementary School in Fengyang County, Shou Changli, in this port. He falsely claimed that Zhou Dezhi, the director of the Provincial Third Mass Education Hall, Peng Zhuoru, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Xueluan, the public relations director of the Datong Coal Mine Company, were short of funds for the Third Yiwu Elementary School and solicited donations outside, and privately engraved Peng's and others' private seals and forged letters of introduction to solicit donations from all parties. The donations were all pocketed. The school authorities discovered this and immediately dismissed Shi's teaching position, and Shi became unemployed. Recently, due to the pressure of life, he relapsed and impersonated a staff member of the Third Mass Education Hall, carrying donation books and forged letters of introduction, and solicited donations from various institutions and groups. Yesterday, he solicited donations from the Stamp Tax Bureau of the 13th District of Hua Chang Street, and the bureau suspected that his behavior was suspicious. He immediately summoned the police to guard him and sent someone to the Mass Education Hall to ask if there was an employee Shi Mou soliciting donations outside. The hall denied it, and the police took Shi to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau for a brief interrogation, and then transferred him to the main bureau for county law enforcement.</p>

<p>Baoshan County Government Has Hired Civilian Labor to Rescue</p>
<p>County Chief Jin Wired the Provincial Authorities for Help Yesterday</p>
<p>Dabaishe reported that the typhoon passed through Taiwan on the evening of the 1st of this month. For days, the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, and the tide was fiercely pounding. For two consecutive days, it roared endlessly. The seawall in Baoshan County shields the counties of Shanghai, Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan, where the essence of the southeast is concentrated. It is extremely important. However, due to years of disrepair, it has been severely damaged. After the great flood in eighteen provinces two years ago, gentlemen from Shanghai and Baoshan and other places appealed, but due to limited funds, only selective repairs could be made. Since the day before yesterday, the rain and wind have been exceptionally violent, and the tide has been surging. By noon yesterday (3rd), the seawall had been washed away in many places, and the tide rushed in wildly, causing severe damage. Yesterday, the Baoshan county chief hired civilian labor to rescue and wired the provincial authorities for help. A reporter from Dabaishe heard the news and rushed to investigate. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>The typhoon blew into Baoshan County from the northeast on the evening of the 1st of this month, accompanied by heavy rain. By the evening of the 2nd, the situation was even worse, and the tide was fiercely pounding. The seawall in all places was in extremely dangerous condition, and the most dangerous places were only one or two feet high. Many of the long-distance telephone poles and wires installed throughout the county were broken by the wind. The cotton in the fields was flowering and fruiting, and almost all of it was blown off. The early rice was about to ripen and was all broken by the wind. The late rice was flowering, and it is unlikely to flower due to this dramatic change. Even if the seawall can be preserved, the disaster is already extremely severe.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Disaster Situation <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Since the hurricane blew relentlessly, the Baoshan County Government immediately ordered the dike engineering technicians, dike patrolmen, and dike guards to intensify their patrols and strictly guard against danger. However, due to the excessive force of the wind, rain, and storm tides, as of yesterday (the 3rd) at noon, the sea dikes at Xuejiatan, Gulongdun, etc., had successively collapsed in more than ten places. In other places such as Laoshidong, the dike bodies were only one or two chi high in some sections, and they were all in a precarious state. The Shanghai area is in danger of being flooded like fish. It is estimated that the following dangerous situations have already occurred: ㈠ Two breaches at Xuejiatan, each two to three zhang long, with the dike body completely washed away, creating through passages. ㈡ A ten-zhang breach at the head section of Gulongdun, with the dike surface collapsed, and the most dangerous part of the dike surface only four or five chi high. ㈢ A fifteen or sixteen-zhang breach in the second section of Gulongdun, with the most severe damage, and the most dangerous part of the dike surface only one or two chi high. One place has already been breached, and water has entered. ㈣ The new works at Chenhuabin (i.e., the post-disaster rehabilitation project carried out last year), both the piles inside and the stone revetments outside the piles, have been damaged, and the dike surface is breached everywhere. ㈥ All of the emergency repair projects from the previous year at Chenhuabin and Gulongdun have been completely destroyed. ㈥ The northernmost section of the Zhangjia stone fort had the earthwork from the previous year completely washed away, and there is also a breach of about ten zhang at the end section, with the most dangerous part of the dike surface only one or two chi high. ㈦ A breach at the head section of Xuejiatan, about twenty zhang long, with the most dangerous part of the dike surface varying from three, four, or five chi high, and some sections of three or four zhang only one chi high, which is extremely dangerous. ㈧ Two layers of the dike surface at Beitang have been washed away, and more than ten or five or six stones have been damaged below. The head section of the dike surface has been washed into a channel. ㈨ More than ten wooden piles at Xiaochuanbei have been destroyed. ㈩ Four or five zhang at the southern end of the Lion Bridge have been washed away, and in the Laoshidong section, there are five or six zhang where only four or five chi of the dike body remains.</p>

<p>After the sea dikes in various places successively became dangerous, the Baoshan County Government, on the one hand, ordered the dike chiefs of each section to beat gongs and gather laborers to do their best to rescue, and on the other hand, hired laborers to move stones for protection. It is estimated that more than ten laborers have been recruited for the head section of Gulongdun, moving old stones to reinforce the dike. In the second section of Gulongdun, thirty or forty laborers have been recruited, and the dike chief has supervised the laborers in collecting sacks and filling the breaches. In other places, laborers are doing their best to rescue. Technicians and patrolmen are also patrolling day and night to prevent further danger.</p>

<p>Declaration of the United Association of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for Emergency Relief for the Yellow River Flood: It is the misfortune of the nation that disasters strike repeatedly. Since the nationwide floods of 1931, man-made and natural disasters have arisen one after another. The lamentable sight of devastation everywhere. We are mindful of the danger to the nation's foundation and the responsibility of every individual. We have repeatedly jointly initiated the Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Provincial Floods, the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association, the Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees, and the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas. We have always been grateful to compatriots at home and abroad for their tireless generosity and generous donations. However, the people suffering in the depths of water and fire have not been rescued to even a small extent, and now the Yellow River has again burst its banks. The flood has spread to the six provinces of Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The disaster area is vast, and there are many disaster victims. The huge flood reaches the sky, and cities and villages are submerged. The dead are washed away, and the living cry out. The desolation and misery, the state of danger and survival, are truly unbearable to see and hear. We are all responsible for the common good, and rescuing the hungry and weak is the duty of all. It is hoped that our elders, brothers, sisters, and all compatriots will embody the virtue of Heaven's love for life and the Buddhist spirit of universal salvation, quickly board the ship of compassion, and jointly avert this catastrophe. We, the members of this association, vow to uphold benevolence and provide sincere relief, ensuring that funds are not wasted and that our efforts are practical. All of our compatriots will truly benefit from this. We hereby declare this for your public consideration.</p>

<p>Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, sent a telegram to the association requesting relief for the disaster victims. The original telegram reads: "According to reports from various counties, on the [unclear date] of this month, Hua County suffered a breach caused by bandits from Changyuan, flooding into Hua and submerging more than 400 villages. Yucheng suffered enormous losses. Other counties such as Mengjin also suffered extremely heavy damage. The provincial government is currently investigating the disaster situation and providing emergency relief. However, the disaster area is vast, and the disaster victims lack both clothing and food. Seeing this tragic situation, we hope for your compassion and plead on their behalf. We humbly request your consideration. Respectfully, Liu Zhi, Special Envoy for Pacification and Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, stationed in Henan."</p>

<p>Baoshan County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang, after dawn yesterday morning, immediately led Secretary Bao Boren, Technical Director Wan Kaijia, Public Security Section Chief Zhang Qian, First Section Chief Wang Zouyun, Second Section Chief Yu Yingduo, and others to the various sections where the disaster occurred to conduct a detailed inspection. He strictly ordered the dike chiefs and technicians to rush to rescue the situation on the one hand and to strictly guard against further danger on the other.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Telegram to the Province Requesting Emergency Assistance <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>After the sea dikes in various places successively became dangerous, the Baoshan County Government immediately sent a telegram to the Provincial Government and the Construction Department yesterday (the 3rd) requesting emergency assistance. The original telegram is as follows: ㈠ "To Governor Gu of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, and Director Dong of the Construction Department, the dangerous situation of the sea dikes has been reported in previous winter and Jiang telegrams. Now, we respectfully report the details of the dangerous situation as of noon today: ㈠ The new works at Chenhuabin (i.e., the post-disaster rehabilitation project carried out last year), both the piles inside and the stone revetments outside the piles, have been damaged, the soil behind the stones has also been washed away, and 30 to 40 zhang of the new dike surface has also been damaged. ㈠ A ten-zhang breach at the head section of Gulongdun, with the dike surface collapsed, and the most dangerous part of the dike surface only four or five chi high. More than ten laborers have been recruited, moving old stones to reinforce the dike. ㈠ A fifteen or sixteen-zhang breach in the second section of Gulongdun, with the most severe damage, and the most dangerous part of the dike surface only one or two chi high. One place has already been breached, and water has entered. Currently, thirty or forty laborers have been recruited, moving stones to reinforce the dike, and the dike chief has supervised the laborers in collecting sacks and filling the breaches. ㈠ The entire section of the Gulongdun sea dike has been damaged, with the dike surface breached everywhere (all of the emergency repair projects from the previous year at Chenhuabin and Gulongdun have been completely destroyed). ㈠ The earthwork from the previous year at the northernmost section of the Zhangjiazha fort has been completely washed away, and there is also a breach of about ten zhang at the end section, with the most dangerous part of the dike surface only one or two chi high. ㈠ A breach at the head section of Xuejiatan, about twenty zhang long, with the most dangerous part of the dike surface varying from three, four, or five chi high, and some sections of three or four zhang only one chi high, which is extremely dangerous. ㈠ Two layers of the dike surface at Beitang have been washed away, and more than ten or five or six stones have been damaged below. The head section of the dike surface has been washed into a channel. ㈠ More than ten wooden piles at Xiaochuanbei have been destroyed. ㈠ Four or five zhang at the southern end of the Lion Bridge have been washed away. In summary, the hurricane attack has caused the already precarious dike works to be completely damaged. In addition to ordering technicians and patrolmen to intensify their patrols, strictly prevent danger, and provide rescue, we have also telegraphed to request that personnel be dispatched for inspection as soon as possible. Respectfully reporting the details of the dangerous situation of the dike works. Respectfully, Jin Qingzhang, Baoshan County Magistrate." Another telegram reads: "To Governor Gu of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, and Director Dong of the Construction Department, the situation of the damaged sea dikes in this county has been telegraphed repeatedly. Now, we continue to report: ㈠ Two breaches at Xuejiatan, each two to three zhang long, with the dike body completely washed away, creating through passages. ㈡ In the Laoshidong section, there are five or six zhang where only four or five chi of the dike body remains. We are now ordering the dike chiefs of each section to beat gongs and gather laborers to do their best to plug the breaches. Further details will be reported later. Respectfully, Jin Qingzhang, Baoshan County Magistrate."</p>
<h3 id="e100">Current Situation in the Northeast Under Japanese Iron Heel <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<h3 id="e101">### Open Gambling and Smoking, Rampant Banditry <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<h3 id="e102">### Heavy Taxes, Impoverished People <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The current situation in the Northeast under the Japanese iron heel is of great concern to the people of the country. The following are excerpts from a written report by a special envoy of Cheng Yun, former chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government and commander-in-chief of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army:</p>
<h3 id="e103">Open Gambling and Smoking <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The three northeastern provinces, under the Japanese iron heel, are implementing a policy of open gambling and smoking to weaken our race. Opium sales offices and people's entertainment ticket sales offices (i.e., gambling tickets) have been established in all commercial ports, large towns, and small county towns. The situation in Harbin can be seen as an example. In Harbin, the Japanese Anti-Smoking Bureau issued opium retail licenses for a total of 36 licenses. Each license requires a deposit of 500 yuan. The opium used is sold by the Japanese Anti-Smoking Bureau at a price of 6 yuan, 6 jiao, 6 fen, and 8 li per tael. Inspectors are dispatched at any time to ensure that opium is not purchased from other sources. There are also more than 1,300 retail outlets that sell in small quantities, mostly run by Koreans. Each outlet employs two or three female attendants, each earning two to three yuan. The daily sales of opium are approximately 7,000 taels. Ten gambling licenses have been issued in Harbin, each requiring a deposit of 500 yuan. The gambling bosses then deduct 20 yuan for every 100 yuan gambled. Since the opening of opium sales, beggars have been seen everywhere, and robberies have occurred frequently, such as the two major robberies on the Gongcheng-Yushu railway line, which is unprecedented in the history of Harbin.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Forced Taxation <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>In Harbin, in addition to the customs and post office being forcibly taken over by force, navigation, salt bureau, and tax donations have also been taken over. Each county tax bureau also has a Japanese advisor. All goods imported from inland China through customs and local products are taxed an additional 30 yuan per 100 yuan, while Japanese goods are taxed only 3 yuan. Local flour produced in Harbin is taxed 5 jiao for each large bag of 150 jin and 1 jiao for each small bag.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Japanese and Puppet Troops and Police <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Each brigade of the puppet army has several Japanese advisors, who supervise the actions of the puppet army. All books, newspapers, and official documents must be approved and signed by the Japanese before they can be issued. The armies have been reorganized by the Japanese, with each battalion changed to a three-company system, with each company having a fixed number of 80 men. Furthermore, the Harbin police security team is filling vacancies with Japanese and Koreans whenever possible. Currently, Japanese police officers account for two-tenths of the police force in Harbin.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Reorganization of the Official System <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Each county in the eastern provinces has three Japanese officials: one is a councilor, who has the right to guide the county magistrate; one is an instructor, who can command the police; and one is the chairman of the Japanese-"Manchukuo" Cooperation Association, who has the right to guide the people. Judging from the current situation, with the exception of senior puppet officials who are willing to be puppets due to their property interests, the lower-level officers and soldiers are constantly hoping for the early restoration of the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Current Situation of Road Administration <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Hulin-Hailun Railway in Heilongjiang Province has already been built. Recently, the Japanese have been extending it northward from Hailun to Heihe and building a line from Jilin to Harbin to connect with the Hulin Railway. They are currently recruiting a large number of workers to carry out the construction. A branch line is also being built from Lalin, through Fujin, to Tongjiang. This line is currently under construction. The road from Jinzhou to Rehe has been under construction for a long time, and the plan for the road from Rehe to Kulun has already been decided. All construction materials and wages are paid in puppet currency, which is also used as a means of exploiting the people. 15 million yuan has been allocated to Jilin and 10 million yuan to Jiang Province to be distributed to the people as spring plowing loans, with an annual interest rate of 8%. However, few people are willing to take out the loans, as they require land deeds as collateral, and there is a danger of confiscation after mortgaging the land.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Rampant Koreans <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Tens of thousands of Korean households have migrated from Korea, following the Japanese army and distributing themselves in the counties east of Harbin. These Koreans seize paddy fields whenever they encounter them. Initially, the Japanese issued them a price of less than 20 yuan for every ten mu, but later they simply drove out the residents, seized the paddy fields, and did not pay any price. The Japanese army also searched the people for self-defense weapons and ordered the police to disarm. The people are furious. The people's groups in Zhuhe and Yanshou counties killed more than 280 Koreans. At the same time, 250 members of the people's groups defected and joined the anti-Japanese army of Liu Zuochen. The Japanese are immigrating Koreans to cultivate rice fields, and their purpose is primarily to supply food for the army. The northeastern armies are destroying paddy fields everywhere, not only making military food supplies hopeless but also making the immigration policy impossible to implement.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Hanging National Flags <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Although Jilin has fallen into enemy hands, there are still places where the blue sky with a white sun flag is hung, namely the four counties of Raohe, Boli, Tongjiang, and Baoqing. These four counties are areas controlled by the anti-Japanese armies of Chen Dongshan, Wang Yong, Liang Xiangchen, Lu Yongcai, He Kuiwu, and Xie Jinglin. Later, due to the reconnaissance and bombing by seven Japanese aircraft, the blue sky with a white sun flag had to be taken down. I wonder when the national flag can be seen flying again in all parts of the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Letter from the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association to the Investigation Association <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<h3 id="e111">### Requesting the Chamber of Commerce to Keep and Investigate the Account Books and Receipts <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Committee for Investigating National Salvation Donations regarding the Investigation Association's request to examine the income and expenditure account books and receipts. The two letters are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully, upon receiving a letter from the Shanghai National Salvation Investigation Committee, entrusting the transfer of income and expenditure account books and receipts for settlement, the Association recognizes that the committee is a temporary group without a permanent person in charge. Should the account books and receipts be hastily delivered, the Association fears they may be scattered and lost. After investigation, the organization of the current settlement was initiated by the Association and bears significant responsibility. After deliberation, the Association decided that the account books and receipts from the date of establishment last year to August 31 of this year will be collected and sent to the Association for safekeeping and for settlement. Special envoy of the Association, accounting director Chen Weixuan, will send twenty volumes of donor registration books, two receipt books, one payment book, one general income and expenditure book, one bank deposit and withdrawal book, one hundred and fourteen receipts for revenue, and two copies of the general report on donations. We hope that each item can be checked and a receipt given.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Reply to the Investigation Committee Letter <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully replying, previously the Association received a letter from the Committee requesting to send income and expenditure account books and receipts for settlement. The Association replied immediately to show welcome and asked that the Committee send personnel to the Association to check the accounts, should there be any unclear points that could be inquired face-to-face at any time and to provide test documents for verification and thorough investigation. On August 24, a reply letter to the Committee announced that accounting director Chen Weixuan would be responsible for contact when personnel came to check accounts. Afterward, the Committee received a letter from August 30th to have the credit record collated and sent up for review on September 1st. There was a special envoy to send the two credit records from the first and second phases, and attached forty-six pieces of donor receipt film from January to June 30th of this year for investigation and verification. The Association was waiting for the review, which was read on the same day. The reason for not being able to send personnel to review accounts was not mentioned. Instead there was a letter of approval, for reasons of inconvenience and as a matter of prudence, there was difficulty sending, refusal to settle and further deep regret, and so on. The letter sent to the Association stated reasons that were not in conformity, and said the settlement was rejected, the opinion was completely contrary to the idea of repeated settlement, and truly deeply horrified. It was also stated that income and expenditure during the settlement period should be stopped immediately, which overran the settlement range, interfered with the main work of the Association, and was difficult to acknowledge. The Association eagerly awaits the settlement, which is the same as the Committee's intention. How the wording of the letter should be, we will leave for now. Only if account books and receipts were instructed to be submitted for review, it was not stated when they should be sent and who should receive them. The Association, as a temporary collective, in the event of loss of important receipts, who should be responsible in the future? After investigating the organizational elements of the Committee, the Association was led by the Chamber of Commerce, so the Association decided to send the income and expenditure account books and receipts to the Chamber of Commerce for safekeeping and for settlement. In addition to the letter sent to the Chamber of Commerce, a corresponding letter replied in hopes of the check.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Shanghai Zhabei Silk Factory Workers Negotiate Resumption of Work on the 5th <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<h3 id="e115">### Production Quota System Awaits Mediation <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai silk factory workers oppose the implementation of the production quota system. After the strike occurred in seventeen silk factories including Zhabei Xinzha area Baotai, the union and the trade association directly negotiated the night before last, and it has come to an end. The production quota system will be postponed for one month, and the striking factories will resume work on the 5th. Here are the details:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Actual Number of Strikers <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng She went to investigate the situation of the striking factories in order to understand the situation. It is known that there are a total of twenty-seven silk factories including Baotai in the Xinzha area that have started work, and four including Ruilun. The four were originally scheduled to start operations on September 1, but in view of the opposition of the workers at factories such as Baotai, they temporarily suspended operations. On the 1st, twelve factories including Baotai went on strike. On the morning of the 2nd, seven of the twelve factories that went on strike stopped sounding the steam whistle to start work. Five factories started work, but the workers did not enter the factory to resume work, and then stopped work immediately. In the afternoon, the female workers of five factories including Xinda were affected by the strike, for a total of seventeen factories. The reporter went to inquire about Mr. Shen Huachen, chairman of the trade association, and learned that the factories on strike in the news area were indeed seventeen, and the rumors of thirty-three are inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Continued Shutdown <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Dagon She says that since fourteen factories including Baotai on Changan Road in Zhabei announced a joint strike on the afternoon of the 1st of this month, the situation has become quite serious when the factories in the Xinzha District and the concession area were also affected the day before yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday, and the factories were closed as usual, so the steam whistle was not sounded in the morning. Today is also the Ghost Festival in the old calendar, which is also a holiday for silk factories, so all factories are closed.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Labor-Management Negotiation <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Union of various districts believes that the silk factories in Zhabei have caused the workers' reaction due to the change to the production quota system, and a strike has occurred. They are deeply concerned that the conflict will expand and affect the silk factories throughout the city, so they specially sent directors Yang Gengdi, Yuan Yunlong, Chen Xiupu, Wu Suzhen, etc. to negotiate with Shen Huachen, chairman of the trade association, and asked them to postpone the implementation of the production quota system and form a research committee to conduct research before implementing it. As a result of the consultation, both parties have reached a considerable understanding, and it has been decided that all factories will sound the steam whistle to start work tomorrow morning. The workers will be persuaded to resume work by the union.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Party and Government Instructions <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Party and government agencies immediately sent personnel to investigate the truth after hearing about the joint strike of silk factory workers in Zhabei. They believe that although this labor conflict occurred because the factory changed to the production quota system, the workers went on strike suddenly before reporting to the Party and government for mediation, which is not the case. Therefore, it was decided that the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau would jointly instruct the silk unions in various districts to immediately persuade the workers to resume work. The issue of changing to the production quota system will be studied again before formally mediating between the two parties.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Notice of Resumption of Work <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sixth District Silk Industry Union issued a notice to the workers of each factory yesterday, that all workers should enter the factory to resume work tomorrow morning, and wait for the Party and government to resolve the issue of the production quota system in accordance with the law. The notice is recorded as follows: Notice: Due to the unauthorized implementation of the production quota system by the factories, the workers of the silk factories in Xinzha District of this district have announced a strike. This association has joined forces with the unions of the third and fourth districts to formulate measures and request the Party and government authorities to be fair and reasonable, and order the factories to postpone the implementation of the production quota system. If the silk factories have indeed postponed the implementation, all workers should enter the factory to resume work, otherwise they should wait for a solution and refrain from extra-curricular actions. It is of utmost importance to comply with this notice.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Declaration <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The joint declaration of the silk industry trade unions of various cities and districts regarding the factory's adoption of the output system states: In recent years, China's foreign trade in raw silk has plummeted, approaching failure. Although the reason for this is partly due to the pressure from Japanese silk, it is undeniable that Chinese silk has not sought improvement. Therefore, if we want to restore the position of Chinese silk in the international market today, improving the manufacturing of raw silk is an urgent and essential task. Our unions absolutely agree in principle with the factory's proposed adoption of an output system. However, upon closer examination of its content, it is impossible not to have doubts. On August 29th, our unions received notice from the factory that the output system would be implemented on September 1st. The urgency of the timing left no opportunity for consideration, which violates the spirit of the mediation record signed on July 8th. Moreover, the so-called output system this time was neither agreed upon by our unions beforehand, nor was there a specific plan or a defined work standard. Furthermore, it is said that although the maximum wage is slightly increased based on the current quota (only increased by four percent), there is a limit that cannot be exceeded. Therefore, no matter how hard-working and skilled the workers are, they cannot receive the wages they deserve due to the limit of the maximum amount. On the other hand, there is no limit to the reduction of wages for those with lower work efficiency. This kind of unfair method is not an output system, but a disguised wage reduction. It can be seen that the original intention of implementing the output system to improve the silk industry, to encourage workers, and to increase work efficiency is probably not like this. Therefore, our unions believe that if the factory is truly determined to improve the silk industry, it should immediately postpone the implementation of this unilaterally decided output system. At the same time, both labor and management should each appoint several representatives to form a research committee under the supervision of party and government agencies. The committee should study based on the principles of developing production, labor-management mutual benefit, and determine a proper plan for the implementation of the output system, specific standards, and other methods of improvement. Only then will there be hope for the revival of the silk industry. This is what our unions earnestly hope for. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

<p>Liu Daoxing, the representative of Cheng Yun, former Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin People's National Salvation Army, recently came to Shanghai on a mission to welcome Finance Minister Song back to the country. In addition to participating in the welcoming on board and attending the welcome banquet, he immediately presented Cheng Yun's original telegram welcoming Song (as seen in the previous newspaper) and Cheng Yun's written opinion, which is divided into ten chapters. All major aspects of politics, economy, military affairs, diplomacy, construction, and education are thoroughly explained, which was greatly appreciated by Finance Minister Song. Song especially praised Cheng. Due to the haste of time, he did not have time to talk with Liu in detail. Yesterday, Song's secretary, Huang Chun-dao, telegraphed Liu, saying that after returning to Beijing from Lu, he would schedule a meeting. It is now known that Liu has completed his mission in Shanghai and returned to Beijing last night to report back.</p>

<p>The Counties Along the Great Wall Have Suffered Disaster Due to Bandits, and Houses Have Been Turned Into Ruins</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Have Not Withdrawn from Miyun and Other Counties, Making Disaster Relief Inconvenient</p>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Association of Charitable Organizations for Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a telegram yesterday from Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen, resident executive directors, stating that the counties along the Great Wall have suffered disaster due to bandits, and houses have been turned into ruins. Japanese troops have not withdrawn from Miyun and other counties, making disaster relief inconvenient despite investigations. The original telegram is recorded below (abbreviated title): The counties along the Great Wall have suffered disaster due to bandits, and houses have been turned into ruins, and the people have lost their livelihoods. Our association has divided the disaster relief into the three districts of Gubei, Xifeng, and Lengkou, which has been reported in detail. Originally, we intended to go to Miyun and other counties for joint relief, but because the Japanese troops have not withdrawn from there, it is inconvenient to implement despite investigations. We have now sent staff members Feng Yangyu, Ma Jintao, and Wu Youfu, and have requested the American Methodist Episcopal Church pastors Su Yide, Tickson, and Jiang Hua to go to Zunhua, Fengrun, and Qian'an counties today to investigate and provide relief.

<p>The Machine Association is Indignant at the Illegal Interference of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Public Concession Municipal Council has repeatedly warned eight rubber factories, including Yiyuan, Tianxing, Dade, Hongda, Zhengda, Shanghai, Shiye, Yisheng No. 1, and Yisheng No. 2, and the China Table Tennis Company, and the French Municipal Council has warned the Dahua Rubber Factory and the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory No. 9. The matter has not been resolved for several months. However, the Public Concession Municipal Council suddenly sent a letter to the Xinya Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory on Xinzha Road, Nananli, demanding that the factory's equipment be reformed within a time limit, otherwise it would be forced to move.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Sudden Warning <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The ten-odd buildings in Nananli are all Xinya Pharmaceutical factories. This time, the Municipal Council sent personnel to inspect and said that this house is a residential building and is not suitable for factory use. Yesterday, a letter was suddenly sent to the factory, stating that manufacturing and raw materials should not be combined in one place, the factory building is too small, and it is also built adjacent to the house. It should be reformed immediately and implemented within three weeks, otherwise, it should be moved to avoid public danger.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Association Expresses <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu, the manager of the factory, told the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency that the raw materials of the factory are not dangerous at all, but the Municipal Council did not investigate carefully and issued a warning, and much of it does not conform to the facts. Therefore, the factory has decided to ignore it. According to Cheng Shouzhong, the executive director of the Machine Association, after the association set out to observe the factories of the members on September 1, it considered the equipment of the Xinya factory to be good. Unexpectedly, it was also illegally interfered with by the Municipal Council. Now the association has decided to protest according to law, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e132">The Center of the Hurricane Has Not Reached Shanghai and Has Already Blown to Southern Korea Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>=The Losses in Various Places Are Not as Severe as in 1931=</p>
<p>=Cotton and Late Rice Were Most Severely Damaged Due to Wind and Rain Immersion=</p>
<p>丨Yesterday the Wind Force Decreased Greatly and Ships Exported as Usual丨</p>
<p>When the hurricane passed through Huadao and Shanbei Island the night before, the port was also affected, resulting in losses in the South City, Zhabei, West Shanghai, Pudong, and Wusong areas. However, it was not as severe as in 1931. Yesterday, the hurricane had changed direction and blown to Southern Korea. The wind labor in the port gradually weakened, and ships have been exporting as usual. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Port Affected <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to the explanation of the Observatory, the center of the hurricane never passed through Shanghai. Although the wind force in the port was strong last night, it was only affected by the edge of the hurricane. The hurricane did come directly towards Shanghai on the afternoon of the 2nd. However, at 4 o'clock the night before, when it reached 30 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, it suddenly changed direction. Therefore, the hurricane did not land, and its center did not pass through Shanghai. At about 9 o'clock the night before, it passed through the border of Huadao and Shanbei Island, so the wind force there reached a huge 12 on the Beaufort scale. The area is only 60 miles away from Shanghai, so there were gales of 10 on the Beaufort scale in the port that night. By 6 o'clock yesterday morning, the hurricane had reached 32 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, which is about 90 miles away from Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Heading to Korea <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>At 6 o'clock yesterday morning, the hurricane changed from the north-northwest direction to the north-northeast direction. At that time, there was a tendency to attack Korea. By 4 p.m., when the center of the hurricane reached 33 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, it changed to a northeast direction. At that time, according to the report of the Observatory, it was obvious that it was blowing to Southern Korea. There are cyclones and tidal waves in the Korean Sea, and heavy gales in the Yellow Sea. According to the exploration, the wind force in the port was 10 on the Beaufort scale the night before, and decreased to 8 yesterday morning. It will be further reduced at night. In addition, Huadao and Shanbei Island outside the Wusongkou had a wind force of 12 the night before, which was reduced to 9 yesterday morning, and reduced to 8 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Getting Better at Night <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>According to the report issued by the Observatory yesterday afternoon, the climate in the port is cooler, with light and calm showers and gales, but it will gradually improve at night. The hurricane is more inclined to the northeast and is proceeding to Southern Korea. There are cyclones and tidal waves in the Korean Sea, and heavy gales in the Yellow Sea. It was also learned that the wind force in the port was 10 the night before, which decreased to 8 yesterday morning, and will be further reduced at night. In addition, Huadao and Shanbei Island outside the Wusongkou had a wind force of 12 the night before, which was reduced to 9 yesterday morning, and reduced to 8 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Ships Exporting <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>After the hurricane passed, the wind force has gradually subsided, and ships in the port have been exporting as usual. According to reports, the ships that exported yesterday were the Kalemulan, Nagasaki Maru, Wusong, Fusheng, Tongzhou, Fusheng, Xinning, and Carl Kies. The imports were the Lailai Wensi, Longhe, and Xiyang Maru, etc., totaling seven or eight ships.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Losses in Various Places <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that when the hurricane affected Shanghai the night before, there were many losses in various parts of the port. In the South City area, such as the Nanyang Iron Factory on Bansongyuan Road, the perimeter wall more than ten feet long was blown down by the gale. At the same time, the front walls of houses No. 56, 57, and 58 in the Fifth Lane of Furunli, Jiumu Land in the city, and the high walls of No. 66, 67, 68, 69, and 70, and the high perimeter wall of the Supervision Department of the Municipal Public Security Bureau also collapsed. The awnings of various wharves on the Bund were also blown away. Many telephone and electric light lines were blown down. Yesterday morning, the Huashang Electric Company and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications sent a large number of workers to repair them separately. It is expected that they can be restored to their original state on the same day. The Wenmiao Park suffered great losses after the gale and rainstorm the night before. Seventy percent of the trees in the entire park were broken. All the street light electric lines in the park were broken. The roofs of several places were damaged due to the trees falling on them. In addition, the Municipal Zoo also suffered losses, but not much. In addition, there were also considerable losses in Pudong and West Shanghai. In the Zhabei area, many Jiangbei grass sheds were blown down and collapsed, resulting in considerable losses.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Water Receded and Cars Passed <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>At 9 o'clock the night before, the wind was tight and the tide was high, causing Huangpu South Road, Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, etc. to be gradually submerged. It was not until 7 o'clock yesterday morning that the water began to recede slightly. Zhejiang Road, Hubei Road, Hankou Road, and the area between Nanjing Road had lower elevations, so the water receded more slowly. The streetcars were blocked and stopped. The open space in front of the Wing On Company, which had already started construction, was filled with mud and soil due to pile driving, so the water depth reached six feet. The houses in Tianbaoli, Xinjiang Road, were all submerged by eight inches of water. It was not until about 2 p.m. that the water receded completely and the tracks appeared. However, the tracks were filled with mud, so the streetcar company ordered workers to remove it. At the same time, the No. 3 and No. 6 streetcars of the British Streetcar Company and the No. 5 streetcars of the French Water and Electricity Company were all opened.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Increase Ferry <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Although the wind force yesterday was not as strong as the day before, the yin and yang were combined, and there were light showers. The waves in the Huangpu River were high and the tide was rapid. The ferry sampans in the Huangpu River temporarily announced price increases due to the strong winds and rapid tides. The usual ferry boat fare was increased from 40 to 60 per person, and the sampan fare was increased from 10 cents to 20 cents. Moreover, from west to east, due to the headwind, it took an hour, so most people changed to the city ferry at Dongmen Road. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau temporarily opened the No. 12 ferry at Dongchang Road and Dongmen Road, because the ferry was crowded with passengers and prone to danger.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Losses in West Shanghai <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Various places in West Shanghai suffered considerable losses from the hurricane and rainstorm from the night before to yesterday morning. The following is a record of what was seen and heard: ㈠ The lights went out. At about 2 o'clock yesterday morning, the power lines in the Zhoujiaqiao area were blown down, and the lights went out completely. There were sparks shooting out from the power lines from time to time, and the larger ones fell like fireballs. The general residents were all frightened and hid. Several power lines were also broken in the Caojiadu Jessfield Road area, and all the lights were out. The lights in the Sixth District Office also went out. Fortunately, District Chief Tan took precautions early and used gas lamps instead. The residents were sleeping soundly, so there was no problem. ㈠ Grass sheds collapsed. Dozens of grass sheds inhabited by poor Jiangbei people in Zhoujiaqiao, Bangbei Tan Zitao, Zhongshan Road, Tanjiadu, Robison Road, and other places were blown down and damaged. It was heard that a grass shed in Tanzi Bay housed four people, large and small. At 3 o'clock yesterday morning, it suddenly collapsed, injuring an old woman and a child. Their heads were broken and bleeding, and their injuries were serious. The grass sheds collapsed and broke, and the poor people cried and ran away like chickens in the water. The situation was pitiful. In addition, the mat sheds and bamboo fences of the residents on Jessfield Road, Connaught Road, and Yuyuan Road were also blown down everywhere. ㈠ Trees were blown down. There were four or five trees on Yuyuan Road, two trees on Jiaozhou Road, about seven or eight trees on Rue Say-Zoong, and five trees at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chongqing Road. A large tree was blown down at the Chenjiazhai near Zhongshan Road. ㈠ Billboards collapsed. Four large pieces of the large billboard next to the Jing'an Temple were damaged. Three large pieces were knocked down at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Tongfu Road. ㈠ Agricultural losses. In the farmlands of West Shanghai, the planted rice, cotton, beans, etc. were mostly blown down. According to the farmers, the rice and cotton were greatly affected, and the future harvest will be greatly discounted.</p>
<h3 id="e141">What Was Seen and Heard in Pudong <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>After the port suffered a hurricane the day before, the large and small boats in the Huangpu River were suspended due to the huge waves. The city ferry between Dongdou Road in Puxi and Dongchang Road in Pudong was suspended at 5 pm to avoid danger, resulting in the complete isolation of news from Pudong. People who work in Puxi could not take a boat home and had to borrow rooms in nearby hotels. Those who lived in Puxi but worked in Pudong also stayed in Pudong and could not cross the river. The general situation of Pudong suffering from the hurricane and heavy rain is recorded as follows: On the day before, because the wind was weak, the residents did not take it seriously. By 8 or 9 pm, the wind became stronger and the rain was pouring down. The streets were deserted and became desolate. At about 11 pm, the Pudong water landed and passed over several miles. The water on Dongchang Road was knee-deep, and those with low houses were all flooded. All places became a vast ocean. And the electricity poles on the streets were blown down by the strong wind. In order to prevent danger, the Pudong Electric Company closed the main hub, so the lights were all turned off. In this dark world, the residents became more panicked. The sound of crying could be heard everywhere. Fortunately, after 1:30 am, the water gradually receded, and it completely receded at 3 am, so they could sleep peacefully. After the reporter waited for dawn, he went to various places to investigate and saw that the bamboo fences were blown down everywhere, and many large trees were also uprooted. There were also a large number of Jiangbei shantytowns that were blown down, and the Jiangbei people were homeless and in a very pitiful state. The Pudong Electric Company ordered a large team of workers to repair the poles and lines in various places throughout the morning, so the power was restored normally in the afternoon. The city ferry at the Dongchang Road Wharf operated normally yesterday morning in order to take care of the east-west traffic relations in Puxi.</p>
<p>Also, at about 2 o'clock yesterday morning, when the waves were churning in the Huangpu River, a pier boat of Zhou Miaosheng, loaded with 42 pieces of white iron, was moored at the Ningshao Wharf in the Sixteenth Concession. It was suddenly overturned by a big wave, and the goods were completely submerged at the bottom of the river. The hull of the boat also drifted away. At 2 p.m. yesterday, Zhou requested the Customs Water Patrol Room to file a case. It was heard that the goods were declared by the Lichang Public Customs Brokerage on Sijing Road, Public Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Wusong Situation <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Wusong bore the brunt of the hurricane's outbreak. From the day before to the night of yesterday, merchant ships were blown over, roads were breached by huge waves, and rice was damaged. The details are recorded as follows: ㈠ The tide rose sharply. When the hurricane came, it happened to be the northeast wind, so the tide rose sharply with the wind, the waves rose and fell, and the huge waves were torrential. The tide in the Yunzao Creek was level with the outer road. In the afternoon, the northeast wind blew tighter and tighter, causing the tide to not recede all day. The evening tide was even greater, rushing to the road. At that time, the Yangjiazhai area on the south bank of Yunzao Creek became a swamp, and the houses of the people were flooded with more than three or four feet of water, even the pots on the stove were floated away. There were four or five floating coffins behind the houses. Fortunately, the wind turned to the old north wind with the west from 10 pm, so the tide did not progress any further. Otherwise, it would be unimaginable. However, the highest tide had risen to more than 40 feet on the Customs water ruler. ㈠ Merchant ships were blown over. The Jiangbei Tianshenggang pig boat Jinchangfa, loaded with 195 live pigs, came to Shanghai to sell. At 10 pm the night before, it sailed into the Sanjia Shuikou in Wusong and was stranded on the stone embankment by a hurricane, causing the entire ship to capsize, and the bottom of the ship was also pierced. Later, the pig customer rushed to report to Mr. Hong Wenjiang, director of the Wusong Delivery Office of the Shanghai Fresh Pig Industry, who immediately hired the Zhongxing tugboat to rescue the live pigs, and all of them were discharged in Wusong. More than a dozen crew members and pig customers were rescued. The ship was badly damaged. There was also a Gaoqiao ferry whose mast was broken by the wind and was about to capsize. Fortunately, it was rescued by another ship, so more than a dozen ferry passengers were spared from drowning. It is heard that there were many other pig boats and merchant ships outside the Sanjia Watergate that were blown over and damaged by the hurricane. Currently, no reports have been received, so there is no way to find out the names of the ships. ㈠ The road was breached. The eastern section of the Wusong Road is the most important place for tidal ebb and flow, so a cement stone embankment was built along the Bund to protect the roadbed. The tide increased sharply the night before, and the huge waves rushed and broke the embankment in five or six places, the larger ones being four or five feet and the smaller ones being one or two feet. However, the place is the key point of the whole town of Wusong, so the situation is quite dangerous. Yesterday, the Municipal Public Works Bureau sent workers to rush to repair it and used bamboo fences and mud to build a temporary emergency method. ㈠ Rice fields were damaged. The rice fields near Wusong suffered great damage during the hurricane. Because the early rice has matured and can be harvested soon, the rice stalks were blown down by the hurricane, and the tide rose sharply, turning the fields into swamps. After a long period of time, the rice will be immersed in water and will inevitably germinate. The late rice is in the fruiting period, and it is feared that there will be no hope for the future harvest after this huge blow. The amount of loss is difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>㈠ Affecting traffic. The Songhu branch line of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, from Zhanghuabang to Fort Taiwan, was also affected by the hurricane. The entire line was flooded the night before, causing traffic to be temporarily suspended yesterday morning. It did not resume operation until the water receded at 11 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Fraud Case of Less Than Sixty Yuan</p>
<h3 id="e143">Wrapping Paper Scams Banknotes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Renting a Guest Room as a Crime Site</p>
<p>Owner of a Copper Coin Exchange Shop Deceived</p>
<p>The world is getting worse, people's hearts are not ancient, and the fraud dramas that occur in society are becoming more and more strange and wonderful. Yesterday, a fraud case of using toilet paper to scam banknotes worth 60 yuan occurred in the South City. Although the purpose of the fraud was small, the cunning of the fraud was unexpected. The details of the case obtained from the investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e144">Starting to Ask for Exchange <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Dashun Cigarette Exchange Shop, No. 115 Fusantang Street, outside Xiaonanmen, South City, has a fairly prosperous business on weekdays. On the 1st of this month, a man of about 30 years old, speaking in a Ningbo accent, suddenly went to the shop and claimed that he was a dealer in copper coins and wondered if the shop wanted copper coins. The shop owner said that the copper coins in the shop were still usable, so he replied that he did not. The man then said goodbye and left. The next day (2nd), the man came again to inquire, and the shop owner still replied that the shop was not short of copper coins and left.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Negotiating the Price <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, at about 9 a.m. yesterday, the man went to the Dashun Cigarette Exchange Shop again and claimed that he had more than 200,000 copper coins at home, and the exchange rate was low. He did not know if the shop wanted to exchange some. The shop owner said that the shop was indeed short of copper coins, and the man had come twice in a row, so it was difficult to refuse. He replied that 200,000 copper coins was too much. Now the shop only needs to exchange 60 yuan of copper coins. The man readily agreed. After the two sides negotiated the price of exchanging 300 copper coins per silver dollar, the man said that all his copper coins were at home. He asked them to send someone to take them with him. The shop owner sent an apprentice, Weng Jinfu (16 years old, from Sanbei), to follow the man with 60 yuan of banknotes to exchange copper coins.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Accompanied to the Guest Room <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Before long, the two arrived at No. 8 Tongjili, Qinglong Bridge. The man opened the door and entered, and the apprentice Weng Jinfu also followed him inside. He saw dozens of packages of copper coins in the guest room, shaped like 2,000 packages each. All of them were wrapped in old newspapers. Weng stepped forward and took a package from the top. He felt that what was wrapped inside was indeed copper coins. Just as he was about to count the number of packages, the man called out repeatedly, "Don't move, don't move! There are a total of one hundred silver dollars of copper coins here. How much do you want to exchange? You can tell me, and I can give it to you." Weng replied that he wanted to exchange 60 silver dollars of copper coins. The man asked for the silver dollars, and Weng handed over all 60 yuan of banknotes to the man.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Abrupt Disappearance <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>That person immediately said, "Sixty foreign coins can be exchanged for many copper coins that you alone cannot carry. Now, you go outside first and call for a rickshaw, and have it wait at the entrance. I will wait here, and after you call for the rickshaw, I will hand over the exchanged copper coins to you and help you load them onto the rickshaw to take back to the shop." Old Weng agreed and went out. Soon, he hired a rickshaw and returned to the original place, but that person had already disappeared. He then automatically moved the paper packages placed in the parlor onto the rickshaw. Suddenly, he felt that the contents of the six paper packages on top were indeed copper coins, totaling twelve thousand. However, the dozens of packages piled underneath felt very light in weight. When he squeezed them, they didn't feel like copper coins either, and he immediately became suspicious. He then opened each one to inspect them, only to discover that all the items rolled up inside these paper packages were toilet paper.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Incriminating the Second Landlord <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Upon seeing this, the apprentice was greatly alarmed and hurriedly looked around, but the person had already vanished without a trace. He then realized that he had been deceived. He rushed back to the shop and reported to the shop owner, who immediately ordered the apprentice to return to the place and bring back the six packages of real copper coins (totaling twelve thousand) to the shop. Then, he went to the place again and, together with Yuan Zhi, the police officer on duty at the 31st Precinct, took the dozens of paper packages resembling copper coins, as well as the toilet paper inside and the second landlord of the house, Han Yun-die, to the First Precinct's First Station. It was already past noon at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Han Yun-die's Testimony <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>When the station chief, Yi Zuan-ren, conducted a preliminary interrogation, the apprentice, Weng Jin-fu, recounted the previous events and requested a thorough investigation. Han Yun-die testified that she was twenty years old, from Huzhou, and lived at 8 Tongji Lane. She had previously studied at Junyi Middle School, but dropped out and joined the Sincere Company as a female clerk in the fountain pen department. After only three months due to the workload being too heavy, she quit her job and stayed at home. Recently, she had come to Shanghai from her hometown to prepare for the entrance exam to Wuben Girls' Middle School this semester. Recently, there was a parlor on the ground floor of her house that she was planning to rent out, so she had posted a "For Rent" sign at the entrance.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Pretext of Renting a Room <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the day before yesterday) at around 2 PM, a person, about thirty years old and speaking with a Ningbo accent, wearing a blue-gray silk long gown, came to view the parlor on the ground floor. After deeming it satisfactory, they agreed on a monthly rent of nine and a half foreign coins. That person immediately paid a deposit of one foreign coin and claimed to work on a ship and also trade copper coins. After that person left, they came to my house at around 6 AM this morning (yesterday), bringing two wooden boxes containing dozens of paper packages that looked exactly like copper coins. We didn't suspect anything because he had claimed the day before that he traded copper coins. That person then said that these copper coins would be temporarily placed in the parlor and moved upstairs when his family members came to move in the afternoon. Because he was already a tenant, we immediately agreed.</p>

<p>That person then bid farewell and left. Not long after, he brought an apprentice to come and move the copper coins. We didn't pay much attention until later when the apprentice realized that the packages contained a scam and the swindler had already escaped without a trace and could not be apprehended. Therefore, that person used toilet paper to swindle cash, and we were truly not in conspiracy with him. I hope you will investigate carefully. As the matter concerned a swindling case, he ordered her to be temporarily detained while he dispatched police officers to investigate the truth before further action was taken.</p>

<p>Investigating the Real Situation of Eleutherococcus and Fritillaria Cooperation</p>
<p>Zhejiang fritillaria is one of the main domestic medicinal materials. The annual output is enormous and sold throughout the country. Farmers in Xiangshan, Yinjiang, and other places rely on planting this medicinal herb to make a living. In recent years, it has transformed from a superior sideline into the backbone of the rural economy. Since the organization of the Xiangshan Eleutherococcus and Fritillaria Marketing Cooperative in March this year, a cooperative sales monopoly has been implemented. Recently, the pharmaceutical markets in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places have felt uneasy due to the sudden increase in the price of Eleutherococcus and Fritillaria. Some even suspect that the cooperative has lost its original intention of organization. To thoroughly understand the real situation of Eleutherococcus and Fritillaria production and the overview of marketing cooperation, the Rural Medical Improvement Society has specially sent the director-general, Zhu Dian, and staff member Xu Gongyu to Ningbo by boat tonight to conduct an on-the-spot investigation to improve the situation.</p>

<p>Last Night the Tide Surpassed the Riverbank Again</p>
<p>After the storm occurred in the local area the night before last, all the roads between the roads were submerged in seawater due to the high tide, exceeding the riverbank, which caused the roads near the Bund to become a watery world. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Although the tide had receded this morning, starting from midnight tonight, the tide rose again, exceeding the riverbank. As a result, the Bund area near Guangdong Road, Fuzhou Road, Hankou Road, Jiujiang Road, Nanjing Road, and other roads was flooded again, about one foot deep. When the reporter wrote this article, the drainage ditches in Shandong Road and other places had also overflowed with water, and the water level continued to rise. The intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road has become a vast expanse of water. Rickshaws raised their fares, and cars were still able to pass, but fortunately, it was not as severe as the night before last. However, at around 11:10 PM last night, the New World electric light advertisement reported that a new hurricane was about to hit Shanghai. This is recorded for future observation.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Recent Developments in Municipal Construction and City Administration <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Ordering New Ferries and Actively Expanding Municipal Ferry Services</p>
<p>Tram Service Planned for Downtown Area</p>
<p>All construction matters in the prosperous city center area were once suspended due to the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Now, they have resumed according to the established restoration plan and have begun to proceed. The original construction work of the various bureaus has also been actively restored, with the aim of realizing the Greater Shanghai Plan in the near future. It is understood that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is carefully reorganizing all aspects of the city's water and land transportation. In addition to the municipal ferry service, which has already achieved considerable success, there are also plans to operate a ferry service between the Yangjingbang Bund and the Pudong Youlong Pier. In addition, the new ferry ordered for the Shanghai-Wusong ferry route is expected to be launched in mid-October. The construction of this ferry is more modern than the old ferry and can carry six to seven hundred passengers. Secondly, in the Pudong area, since the opening of the Pudong ferry, east-west transportation in Pudong has become much more convenient. The Pudong Avenue project is also two-thirds complete. After its completion, people in Shanghai can also travel to Pudong by car. The only areas in the city's land transportation that lack complete facilities are western Shanghai, Zhabei, and Wusong. The Public Utilities Bureau has drafted a long-distance tram line that extends from Nanshi to western Shanghai, passes through Zhongshan Road, enters Zhabei, and then goes from Zhabei to the Jiangwan city center area and Wusong. This plan is difficult to implement at the moment due to the city's financial constraints. Otherwise, not only would western Shanghai be able to prosper, but transportation between Shanghai and Wusong could also be greatly facilitated. As for the construction of the Qiujiang Pier to facilitate cargo transportation, it is still in the planning stage due to funding constraints. The opening of a public bus route in the city center area requires the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company to expand its capital due to capital constraints to facilitate its progress. In the future, official shares may need to be added to achieve joint official-private management.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Municipal Public Security Bureau Police Brigade Renamed General Brigade <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The organizational laws of public security bureaus in various provinces and cities originally established security teams or security brigades. However, due to special circumstances in this city, there is a separate Security Office under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government. To avoid duplication, the Municipal Public Security Bureau changed the name of the Security Team to the Police Brigade. However, this was not fully in accordance with the army's organizational law. Therefore, Director Wen presented the organizational content and reasons to the Municipal Government for approval. The mayor then approved the renaming of the original Police Brigade to the Police General Brigade, without establishing separate brigades. The original squadrons will remain as they were. The Bureau has already notified all districts and stations under its jurisdiction of this order.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Drafts Fish Market Plan <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to the Municipal Government for Transfer to the Ministry of Industry for Approval</p>
<p>Total Construction Cost of One Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau recently drafted a plan for the Shanghai Fish Market and submitted it to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The original draft plan is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Equipment of the Shanghai Fish Market: (1) Special wharf for fisheries: This wharf must be at least 600 feet long, built along the shore, with a floating ship attached that can rise and fall with the tide. This is to allow the city's fishing boats, refrigerated fish boats, and freshwater fish boats to dock and unload their catches at any time, and to load ice and coal. This will enable two trawlers and many refrigerated fish boats and freshwater fish boats to dock at the same time, so that loading and unloading can be done quickly and time can be saved. (2) Cold storage and ice-making plant: The cold storage facility must have a volume of at least 100,000 cubic feet to store a large quantity of aquatic products. The ice-making plant must be able to produce 40 tons of ice per day to supply fishing boats and refrigerated boats. (3) Packaging yard and warehouse: The packaging yard is used to sort and organize the catch after it is unloaded. The packaging yard will handle products that are supplied to the market, are to be imported inland, or are to be stored in cold storage in advance to ensure speed. The warehouse will be used to store salted and dried aquatic products. (4) Auction hall: The auction hall is an important place for the fish market to operate every morning. The area must be large, and the ventilation, lighting, and wastewater disposal system must be carefully designed. The layout should be in a grid pattern to facilitate traffic inside the hall, and it can be designed with reference to the construction method of small vegetable markets. (5) Fisheries Bank: As the fish market is the only collection and distribution center for fresh and salted fish in the city, it is estimated that the total monthly turnover is about 1.5 million yuan. Loans for operating advances and for fishermen and fish merchants are inevitable. For the sake of circulating finance and prospering the fishing industry, the establishment of a fisheries bank is particularly important. (6) Fisheries consumer cooperative: All the supplies needed for fisheries and the daily needs of fishermen, whether for business or personal consumption, are usually purchased through intermediaries, whose exploitation is quite considerable over the years. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a consumer cooperative to purchase and consume together, which can eliminate the profit-sharing of intermediaries and save expenses and increase income. (7) Preparation of refrigerated trucks and refrigerated ships: The purpose of establishing a fish market is to regulate food for the people, promote production, and promote sales. However, in the event of overproduction or strong demand from other ports, in addition to using the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways and Yangtze River ships for transportation to other ports, towns and villages closer to the fish market must use roads for transportation in refrigerated trucks. Conversely, in the event of insufficient supply, it is necessary to prepare fresh-collecting ships and refrigerated ships to go to the fishing grounds to collect fresh fish. (8) Live fish pond: Shanghai's annual consumption of freshwater fish imports is no less than 5 million yuan, and most of the fish comes from places such as Linghu, Zhejiang. Usually, after the live fish boats arrive in Shanghai, they cannot leave Shanghai until they are completely sold, which is time-consuming and uneconomical. Therefore, the fish market must prepare its own live fish pond for short-term breeding. (9) Telecommunications equipment: In order to communicate with the fishing grounds, the fish market should be equipped with a 100-watt short-wave radio station to communicate with the fishing boats working in the fishing grounds and report the market price of various fish every day, so that each fishing boat can independently budget the value of its catch to determine the date of import. (10) Entertainment Department: Including reading newspapers, reading books, bathing, movies, lecture halls, etc. (11) Offices of various departments of the fish market. (12) Dormitory.</p>
<p>(B) Location of the fish market: Since the Greater Shanghai Plan was determined, efforts have been made to construct the central area. In the future, when the commercial port moves north and the railway moves far away, the concession will no longer be able to be the hub of the whole city, and citizens may move. The construction of the fish market should be close to the commercial port area, near Wusong Yunzaobang, which seems to be more appropriate. The realization of this commercial port plan will take time, so if the Shanghai Fish Market needs to be built in the next year or two, it may still be appropriate to choose a site near the Guanqiao area of Nanshi along the shore. However, in order to facilitate the control of incoming and outgoing fishing boats so that they are not monopolized by old forces, building the fish market north of Yangshupu and close to the urban center along the shore can be a powerful control measure.</p>
<p>(C) Business Scope and Business Methods of the Shanghai Fish Market: Before the central government promulgates the Fish Market Law, the organization and business of the fish market will be handled in accordance with the draft Fish Market Law. The fish market is the highest authority in the local area to control aquatic products, fresh and salted fish, and bears a heavy responsibility. Its business scope includes not only seafood and river fish but also dried products. The business method is mainly entrusted sales in the ordinary department. It accepts the entrustment of fishing vessels, ice-fresh vessels, salt-fresh vessels, and river-fresh vessels to sell on their behalf. When there is a shortage of market demand and entrusted purchases from the mainland, it must find ways to purchase them itself to regulate the catch. In order to regulate the catch, the fish market first organizes packaging to sort out the catch and estimate the quantity of daily food needed by the city's residents. If the products are to be sold to the mainland or there are orders, they will be packaged and shipped to the mainland by the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways and Yangtze River ships. Therefore, from the very beginning of its establishment, the fish market must contact the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways and the China Merchants Bureau to add refrigerated equipment to facilitate transportation. Those towns and villages near the city that do not have railways or ships will be transported by refrigerated trucks or refrigerated ships. If there is still fish left, it will be stored in cold storage. (Omitted in the middle) The wholesale of fresh and salted fish in the fish market is sold by brokers by auction. After the auction is completed, the person in charge of the fish market will hand over the fish price to the seller, deducting only a small handling fee. The rate is from 5% of the selling price and shall not exceed 7%.</p>
<p>(D) Funds: The construction cost includes 200,000 yuan for the construction of the entire fish market, another 200,000 yuan for the cold storage and ice-making plant, about 100,000 yuan for the wharf and refrigerated trucks and ships, and 500,000 yuan for the Fisheries Bank capital, totaling 1 million yuan. However, the land value is not included.</p>

<p>Please Send Them to Civilian Work Training Centers</p>
<p>The Suzhou Creek bridges have always been crowded with thugs. Whenever a streetcar goes on the bridge, they help the conductor push the car as a pretext to solicit a copper coin from the passengers. The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association believes that although this matter does not hinder public order, it is enough to foster idle thugs. It is heard that the executive committee discussed it yesterday and decided to ask the Public Works Department to order the police to capture them and learn a skill so that they can support themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Chronicle of the New Huizhou Association's Gathering <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun Speaks on the Benefits of Joining the Fellow Countrymen Association</p>
<p>The New Huizhou Association held a gathering at Apricot Blossom House on Fourth Ma Road yesterday at 6:00 PM. Dozens of people attended. Zhao Chaochang, chairman, announced the purpose of the meeting, followed by Executive Committee member Zheng Xingpu reporting on the progress of the association's affairs. Municipal Government Secretary General Yu Hongjun was also present yesterday. His speech was summarized as follows: "Your enthusiasm for the association's affairs is admirable. However, there are no less than 10,000 fellow countrymen, and less than 5% have joined the association. This is because everyone is looking out for themselves and sees no difference between joining or not joining the association. I believe that for oneself and for others, one must join the fellow countrymen association. The saying goes, 'Watch out for each other and help each other in times of illness.' If you join, you will have the association's duty to provide guidance for seeing a doctor, receiving education, or in the event of an accident, which can avoid all kinds of difficulties. If the New Huizhou Association occupies a superior position in society, any problem will be easy to deal with. It is not just about joining the association, paying membership fees, and having dinners. Look at the achievements of the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association. It has been able to deal with the Northeast issue and government issues. We should use our brains, think more, and jointly organize basic methods to recognize the center of gravity. If lawyers, doctors, artists, architects, and business people all look out for themselves, they will not have a strong organization. As for the current New Huizhou Association's grave sweeping and dinners, all the proceedings cannot go beyond the scope of the past fellow countrymen associations. We should look at the Shanghai environment and the government's position to strive for survival and first seek the establishment of basic institutions before we have a foothold. Fellow countrymen should broaden their horizons, focus on efforts, and seek happiness for the masses, not just limit themselves to charity and education."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday, stating: "According to an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, 'This department has previously drafted measures for township and town offices in various counties to assist in deed taxation, and is hereby ordered to be followed. Please notify the citizens of the county so that they are aware that in the future, when encountering matters of buying and pledging real estate, they must purchase official deed paper from the relevant township and town office nearby to write the deed and submit it to the county for taxation within the time limit. Private paper deeds must no longer be used, or they will be punished.' The case involves the reorganization of deed tax and essential measures, which must not be ignored.' Having received this order, in addition to ordering all districts to forward it to the various townships and towns for compliance, it is hereby announced to the citizens of the county so that they are aware that when adding property, they must obtain the protection of the law. If they greedily conceal it and privately use blank deeds, if discovered, not only will they lose its legal effect, but they will also be severely punished. The gains and losses are not difficult to choose. The purpose of the Department's order is not only to boost tax revenue, but also to stabilize property rights for all industries. Everyone must understand this intention. Whenever they encounter matters of selling and pledging real estate, they must purchase official deed paper from the relevant township and town offices nearby to write the deed. There must be no mistakes."</p>

<p>Wu Mingcai, a Chongming native from 9 Zhujiazhai, Houfu North Road, behind the new municipal government in the city center of East Shanghai, worked as a hired laborer there and lived with his wife and children. His wife, Wu Wang-shi, was 35 years old and a traditional woman from the countryside with a narrow mind who liked to gossip with neighbors. More than ten days ago, she had a quarrel with a neighbor over a trivial matter. The neighbor was eloquent, so in the end, Wu Wang-shi was no match in the village women's scolding match. Her face turned red, she felt ashamed, and returned home. She could not vent her anger and cried alone. When her husband returned home and saw this situation, he was very surprised and asked what was wrong. She then told him the whole story, hoping that her husband would stand up for her. However, Wu was a lonely stranger in a foreign land and a hired laborer, and he did not have the ability to do so. He did not dare to interfere too much, so he warned his wife not to be meddlesome. She was even more saddened that her husband did not help her but instead blamed her, and she grieved that she had married a cowardly and incompetent husband, causing his wife and children to suffer. When Wu saw this, he tried to comfort her in every way possible, and she temporarily stopped crying, but she remained depressed, as if she had a lot on her mind and had nowhere to vent it. Yesterday afternoon, her husband went to work in the fields. When he returned home, he could not find his wife and called out but received no response. He searched the room and found that she had hanged herself on the bedrail. He quickly untied her, but she had been dead for a long time. Wu was distraught by this tragedy and reported to the 7th District, 1st Station, requesting justice for his wife. He was instructed to have the local Baojia chief report for examination first. Ouyang Shu, a prosecutor from the local court, went to the scene to examine the body and confirmed that she had committed suicide by hanging. He ordered the body to be taken for burial and await further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Two Zen Masters Establish a Clinic in South Shanghai <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Benefiting the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>Zen Masters Xingci and Kai, abbots of the Fancang Temple on Rue Grosse in the French Concession, have profound knowledge of Buddhist scriptures and are particularly enthusiastic about local charitable undertakings. Recently, in view of the fact that there are many factories and residents in the South Shanghai area, but there are no suitable clinics for providing diagnosis and medicine nearby, which is very inconvenient for workers and the poor seeking treatment, they specially discussed with three lay Buddhists in Shanghai, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, and Guan Jiongzhi, to select a site at the intersection of Xieqiao Jumen Road and Yuwei Road to build a Fancang Temple clinic. The location is refreshing and the scale is grand. They also invited the famous Shanghai doctor Xia Yingtang to hire two doctors on their behalf. One is Ma Xin-hou, an expert in internal medicine and surgery, who is a descendant of the Menghe Ma Peizhi family. The other is Qin Liu-an, an expert in internal medicine, who is the younger brother of the famous local doctor Qin Bowei. Both Dr. Ma and Dr. Qin have profound family knowledge and rich experience, and the selection of doctors for this clinic can be said to be appropriate. Since the clinic opened on the 30th of last month, the number of people seeking diagnosis and treatment has been increasing day by day. On the first day, there were 45 patients, on the second day, there were 56 patients, and on the third day, there were 73 patients. The future development should not be inferior to the Renji Weizhong temples. As for the two Zen masters, they can be said to be the ones who remove all the suffering of all beings. It is also heard that the clinic plans to add a Western medicine room, and everything is currently being planned and will be realized soon.</p>

<p>＝The husband is unwilling but unable to resist＝</p>
<p>＝He hits the policeman's head with a stone by the roadside＝</p>
<p>Liu Dongming from Shandong, together with his concubine Ms. Xu, came to Shanghai from their hometown in early July of this year for sightseeing. They stayed in a workshop of a certain yarn factory on Yulin Road, and spent their days entertaining themselves in various amusement parks. Within two weeks, all the money they had brought was used up, and being unfamiliar with the place and people, they had nowhere to borrow. He remembered that he had relatives doing business in Qingdao, so on the 20th of that month, he went to Qingdao to borrow money. Ms. Xu remained in Shanghai. At that time, he said that he would return soon, but several months have passed without any news. Ms. Xu was naturally licentious and unaccustomed to sleeping alone, so she developed a physical relationship with Jiang Songmin, a fellow villager working as a Chinese policeman No. 2667. Their love was intense, and they lived together like a married couple, renting a house at No. 409 Qiwupu Road. Until 7 p.m. the day before yesterday, Liu Dongming returned to Shanghai from Qingdao by boat. When he returned home, the place was empty. He immediately found out that Ms. Xu and Jiang were living together. He rushed to negotiate. Ms. Xu admitted it without hesitation and gave him five Yuan silver coins, so Liu could return to Shandong and find another way to make a living. Liu was shocked and immediately became jealous, so he had a quarrel with Ms. Xu, parted in hatred, and wanted to find a way to deal with it. He wandered around Yangzhou Road. After a while, he saw Ms. Xu and Jiang going out together. He wanted to step forward and question them, but seeing Jiang the policeman's burly figure, he knew he could not defeat him. So, he picked up a piece of cement stone by the roadside, rushed up from behind, and hit Jiang's head hard. Jiang turned his head in pain, saw that it was Liu, and immediately wrestled him to the ground and beat him. Liu was no match for him after all. He jumped up and ran madly towards Qiwupu Road. Jiang the policeman did not give up and chased after him. The Indian policeman No. 109 on guard there saw Liu running towards him, and immediately stopped him. After questioning, he found out that it was a fight, so he took both parties to the police station. The police chief found out that both of them were injured, so he ordered them to be sent to the Chinese Patrol Hospital on Huade Road for treatment. After the doctor's examination, Liu Dongming's hand was injured, but there was no major problem. After applying medicine and bandaging, he was taken back to the police station. The next morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Zehan interrogated him. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, saying that Jiang the policeman was still in the hospital and had not recovered, so he should request a postponement. Then, according to Indian policeman No. 109 and the woman Jiang Xu, they testified about what happened. When asked, Liu Dongming confessed that Jiang the policeman should not have forcibly occupied another man's wife, and asked for a clear judgment. Judge Wu ordered him to be remanded in custody and the trial was postponed.</p>

<p>Chen Yongnian from Pudong, the owner of Dexing Plank Box Shop at No. 92 Aidoa Road, was sentenced to imprisonment in the West Prison on Huade Road for theft. Around February of this year, Yu Jinshan, a Qingkou native who was Warden No. 39, falsely wrote letters under the pretext of the prisoner being ill, and went to Dexing Plank Box Shop to fraudulently collect seven silver dollars from his wife, Ms. Qin, for his own use. The case was discovered by the Chinese warden of the West Prison, who sent Warden Yu to the Huishan Police Station to be handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This has been detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that Chen, the prisoner, and witness Wang San had been brought to court for cross-examination. Wang San then testified that he used to be Chinese policeman No. 84 in the West Prison and has now resigned. At that time, the defendant did give him the letter and asked him to collect 17 dollars from Chen's shop, promising to give him two dollars. Because he knew it was against the law, he was unwilling to go. Later, he went by himself, which is true. Chen Yongnian also testified that he did not write a letter to him. When asked, the defendant's confession was evasive.

<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>丨Speech at the Third National Congress of the National Women's Youth Association丨</p>
<p>Distinguished representatives, Shanghai feels very honored that your association has come to Shanghai to hold the Third National Congress. As the head of this city, I would like to express my warm welcome on behalf of the citizens. The representatives of this conference come from the rural areas of the Chinese mainland, and of course there are many from the cities. The statistical significance of this number of representatives is that it allows us to predict the success of this conference.</p>
<p>Distinguished representatives, coming to Shanghai from the mainland, you must recognize that Shanghai is an economic center of China; it is the location of a driving force for the whole of China. Shanghai has more than 3.1 million people, making it the fifth largest port in the world; it is not only the largest commercial port in China, but also one of the largest commercial ports in the Far East. Now Shanghai has already occupied an important position in the country in terms of economy, culture, and public opinion; but the increase in Shanghai's population is even more alarming. In Xianfeng five years, that is, more than 70 years ago, the Public Concession had only a few hundred people, and the whole city had only 30,000 to 40,000 people, but today there are more than 3.1 million. However, the reasons and conditions for the increase in Shanghai's population are different from those of cities in other countries around the world. The increase in the population of cities in other countries around the world is due to the convenience of transportation and the development of industry. However, the sudden increase in Shanghai's population is not due to the development of industry, but because of the continuous warfare in China for the past two or thirty years, social unrest, reduced production, unimproved production tools, and the imminent bankruptcy of the rural economy. The rich people have come to Shanghai, relying on the concessions to make a comfortable nest; the poor have also flocked to Shanghai to make a living. This has continued to increase Shanghai's population to 3.1 million. Therefore, the sudden increase in Shanghai's population is actually a symbol of the bankruptcy of our country's rural economy and the uneasy lives of our people. This is such a dangerous and terrible thing! Distinguished representatives, most of you come from the mainland, so when I welcome you today, I will briefly report the general situation of Shanghai to you. At the same time, I hope that you representatives will have time to conduct an on-the-spot investigation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Distinguished representatives, you have come here from afar from the Chinese mainland. Although the Chinese mainland is not as prosperous as Shanghai, the people in the Chinese mainland are kind and the customs are good, which cannot be expected in the treaty ports. Therefore, representatives, when you see the prosperity and luxury of Shanghai, please do not envy it. You must know that China has reached the point of exhaustion. Under such circumstances, not only can our people not rise up to remedy the situation, work hard to improve production tools, increase production, and enrich national power; but the situation is getting worse and worse, and the leaks are increasing day by day. According to the Customs Report for the 20th year: Our trade deficit in China is 540 million; in other words, comparing the export and import of domestic and foreign goods every year, we still have to take 540 million out. If the national blood is leaked out like this for a long time, how can we not be poor! How can we not die! China has suffered from severe anemia, and the blood is gradually drying up; even without foreign troubles, without the military aggression and oppression of the Japanese, it can lead to death. This is indeed the most dangerous period in our country's history, so the only important task in China today is "national salvation," which the chairman just said. However, national salvation work should be jointly responsible by men and women. Although the national salvation work of men and the national salvation work of women may differ due to different positions; but their purpose is the same. The general theme set by this conference is "Building a New Society." This general theme really makes us express our heartfelt respect to the representatives; because our national salvation work varies among individuals due to different knowledge, abilities, opportunities, and environments. However, as long as all compatriots in the country, regardless of men or women, do their best with their intelligence, do a little, we will get a little achievement. This is truly beneficial to the country and beneficial to the people.</p>
<p>However, before we engage in national salvation work, we must also establish a goal; to revive our Chinese nation. The Chinese nation has thousands of years of history and has made great contributions to world civilization. Although modern European civilization is far better than our country, how can their civilization today not be inspired and influenced by the civilization of the Chinese nation thousands of years ago. The Chinese nation is the largest, most civilized, and most contributing nation in the world, but today it has fallen behind. The national spirit has also been so decadent. The reason for this is entirely because of the disappearance of our national self-confidence in the past few hundred years; because of the disappearance of national self-confidence, our Chinese people have not been able to promote the inherent creative ability of thousands of years. This is the biggest root cause of national decline. So, to save the country, we must first carry out the revival movement of the Chinese nation, and restore the self-confidence of the Chinese nation; if each of us takes the revival of the Chinese nation as the basic work of saving the country, and works hard with the spirit of bravely advancing, I believe that our country can definitely be saved. The general theme of this conference, "Building a New Society," is one of the most important and basic tasks in the revival movement of the Chinese nation. Every Chinese person has this great ambition, and I believe that the construction of a new society will definitely succeed. Our ancestors did a lot of great things thousands of years ago. Although we now have more opportunities for education and more opportunities for doing business than our ancestors, we are still far behind the things that our ancestors did. It is really a shame. Now the people of the whole country are calling for national salvation; however, national salvation is not just resisting Japan. Resisting Japan is a part of the work of saving the country. The work of saving the country is really a thousand and one things. We must contribute our bodies and all our strength to the society and to the country, and the work of saving the country cannot be completed. The work that women undertake is different from that of men, and women generally feel that their work of saving the country is not as direct and significant as that of men. In fact, I think women's responsibility is more important than that of men; especially the work of building a new society, women should take more responsibility, because the masters of the country in the future and the backbone of the new society in the future all depend on the education of women. The theme of this conference is "Building a New Society," which is deeply in line with the main points of the women's movement. I hope that the representatives will lead women all over the country to move towards this goal.</p>
<p>Finally, I also hope that when you go back to your hometowns, you will bring a message to the people in various places: To make Shanghai a truly prosperous city in name and reality, we must first revive the rural economy. The city is like a fish, and the inland rural area is like water. If the water dries up, the fish will have no way to survive. Now the rural economy in various places is bankrupt, like there is no water. The fish in the city can only die. Although Shanghai is so prosperous now, it is fake. To revive the Chinese nation and save the country, we must start from reviving the rural economy in various places, based on our inherent spirit and civilization of thousands of years, and accept modern Western civilization to build a new society and build a new China! Today I offer this idea to all the representatives and wish the representatives and the conference success.</p>

<p>Sends Inspector Jin and Other Six People</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Education Department believes that the 21st year has ended, and the reports on the implementation of the minimum standard work of the public education centers and peasant education centers in various counties have been submitted to the department one after another. According to the eighth article of the Jiangsu Province's method of examining the implementation of the minimum standard work of the public education centers and peasant education centers in various counties, it is urgent to send personnel to various counties for random inspection to assess them. Inspector Jin Zonghua and other six people have been sent to various counties for random inspection, and they have set off one after another. The counties to be inspected by each person are listed below. Inspector Jin Zonghua will randomly inspect 11 counties including Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Gaochun, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, Liyang, and Yangzhong.

<h3 id="e181">Jiangsu Education Department Orders the Issuance of Teaching Progress Schedules for Each Subject in Senior and Junior High Schools <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>And Orders Compliance</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department ordered that the academic level of each middle school in the province varies greatly, and the teaching progress also differs. The reason is that the teaching progress has not been determined, so that each subject cannot develop evenly. The Director of the Department, in view of this, has hired experts in each subject and several people with experience in secondary education to organize a committee to jointly study. For example, senior high school subjects such as civics, Chinese, English, mathematics, history, geography, physics, chemistry, biology, and ethics; and junior high school subjects such as civics, Chinese, English, mathematics, history, geography, botany, zoology, chemistry, and physics are assigned to be responsible for compiling the teaching progress schedules separately. Except for the civics subject, which should wait for the curriculum standards to be promulgated before compiling, the rest of the subjects are divided into detailed items and allocated to each week according to the outline listed in the senior and junior high school curriculum standards as the standard for implementation. It took several months and meetings to complete. The committee members based their teaching experience and carefully compiled the schedules. Although it is not perfect, it can also be used for practical teaching. Now that the school year has already begun, each middle school will open soon. The aforementioned progress schedules, except for the English subject, which is still being printed, have been printed. In addition to submitting them to the Ministry of Education for filing, they are also distributed. The aforementioned progress schedules are checked and issued, and a checklist is attached, ordering the director of each bureau to forward them to each middle school for compliance. From the new students of senior and junior high schools this year, they should be implemented uniformly. Each county's middle school's academic level is too different from the general standard, and they should earnestly follow this order to improve the level and unify the progress. They must not be insincere or ignore it. The Department will check the progress of each subject at any time based on each schedule to reward or punish them. It should still be reported first for record. As for the English progress schedule, it will be ordered and issued after it is printed. This order should be known.</p>
<p>浙敎廳 Orders All Counties and Cities to Improve Rural Public Schools</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department believes that the rural economy is on the verge of collapse, and that the way to revitalize it lies not only in the economic aspect, but also in paying attention to the promotion and improvement of rural education. It has been found that in the past, the handling of public school education in various counties and cities of the province has often neglected rural areas, either by not establishing enough schools to accommodate the majority of the public, or by poor management leading to no results, or by stopping classes midway due to the busy farming season before the courses are completed. How can this achieve significant results? Educational administrative organs in all counties and cities must make efforts to correct this malpractice within this year. On the one hand, they should pay attention to improving the existing public schools in rural areas, and on the other hand, they should establish and open the planned public schools in rural areas before October this year, in order to complete the courses during the farming off-season from late autumn to early spring and hold graduation ceremonies.</p>

<p>Result: 55 to 23</p>
<p>丨 Qingguang vs. Tongji Tonight at 7:30丨</p>
<p>The Qingguang Basketball Team from Nanjing made its debut last night against the Xiaguang Team from Daxia University at the China Basketball Gym. Wei Haiqing, Xian Zhuanghuai, Zhou Jun, etc. of Qingguang have long been famous and performed quite well. The Xiaguang team has uneven talent, and its offense and defense are inferior. As a result, Qingguang won by 55 to 23. In the first half, Qingguang scored 23 points and Xiaguang scored 14 points. Tonight at 7:30, Qingguang will play against the Youth Association at the China Basketball Gym.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, after several back-and-forths, Wei Haiqing, the center of Qingguang, scored two consecutive goals. Chen Baoqiu of Xiaguang selected one. At that time, both sides seemed to be in the initial test period, and the situation was not yet tense. Qingguang had many opportunities to throw the ball, but there were few long shots that hit the target, and all relied on close shots to score points. The rear defense was tight, and Xiaguang was weak and had no opportunity to make a plan. Qingguang once took the lead by 14 to 2. Xiaguang started to add two points by Ren [blank] Xing. Afterwards, Qingguang's momentum gradually increased, and Xian Zhuanghuai and Guo Zhen frequently scored, taking a remote lead by 22 to 4. Xiaguang reinvigorated and gradually expanded, and [blank] An and Ren Jiexing added ten points in a row, creating 14 to 22 at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the second half, Xiaguang's momentum suddenly increased, and the competition became fierce. The scores increased each other, but after five minutes of stalemate, Xiaguang felt unable to support it, while Qingguang was in its heyday and its momentum was like a flame. Therefore, the situation became one-sided from then on. When Xiaguang scored 19 points, Qingguang had already scored 45 points. Xiaguang's lineup was chaotic and deteriorated. In the final result, Qingguang won by 55 to 23. Referee Zhou Jiaqi, the scores are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Qingguang　Fouls　Score　▲Xiaguang　Fouls　Score</p>
<p>Guo Zhen　0 times　14 points　Zhang Renheng　0 times　4 points</p>
<p>Xian Zhuanghuai　1 time　19　Lin Qiren　0 times　0 points</p>
<p>Wei Haiqing　1 time　17　Ren Xing　1 time　8 times</p>
<p>Gong Jialu　1 time　0 points　Chen Baoqiu　3 times　5 points</p>
<p>Zhou Jun　1 time　1 point　Xiang Jiachang　2 times　0 points</p>

<p>First half Qingguang 22 points Xiaguang 14 points</p>
<p>Second half Qingguang 33 points Xiaguang 9 points</p>

<h3 id="e207">Not Thorough <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Sisou</p>
<p>China's thousands of years of history can be described as a completely not thorough history. No matter which aspect, it is not thorough. Just like changing dynasties, which is considered the biggest change in history; however, besides changing surnames, what thorough change has there been? I am afraid that only the murder of the descendants of the previous dynasty is the most thorough when changing surnames. The Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen of the Six Dynasties were only thorough changes in terms of changing surnames and killing the previous imperial family. There was no sign of change even on the surface. Most of the high-ranking officials of the previous dynasty maintained their original positions. And Feng Dao of the Five Dynasties actually served four dynasties and thirteen monarchs, and held the positions of generals and ministers. He was very proud and called himself the "Old Man of Lasting Joy." The changes in the dynasties after the Song and Yuan Dynasties only replaced another group of people in the court, and society was still the old society, with no changes at all. Unfortunately, the Xinhai Revolution repeated the same mistakes. It only transferred power from the hands of the Manchus to the hands of the Northern Warlords. The revolutionaries could not even stand in their homeland in an instant. Society remained the same, and the people were struggling to survive, with a sigh of things getting worse! How terrible is this "not thorough" malady!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, China's lack of thoroughness has even been transmitted to foreigners in the concessions! When we walk on the road, we often encounter a black car, the compartment is rectangular, and it is as big as a room. The front and rear doors are closed and driving. It is a car specially used to catch petty thieves. There are Chinese and Western police officers on it, patrolling on the roads. When they see petty thieves, they stop and catch them, saying it is for the sake of tidying up the city. But after being caught and sent to the police station, they are only detained for two or three days and then released. After being released, they still obstruct the city, so they are caught again, released again. After being released, they are still caught, without end.</p>
<p>In fact, this lack of thoroughness is not only limited to foreigners in the concessions. Looking at the international arena, what kind of meetings, what kind of agreements, are all not thorough? However, the wheel of time will eventually move forward; there will eventually be a day when "not thorough" will be shattered, and there will be a thorough great thoroughness.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Airplane and Armored Vehicle <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Lanxi</p>
<p>Speaking of these two terrible and hateful weapons, we will associate with the panic situation during the Shanghai War last year. Overhead, there were airplanes circling with squeaking sounds, and in the distance, there were armored vehicles attacking. These were all sent by the enemies. Under the terror of these airplanes and armored vehicles, we in Shanghai at that time were really frightened.</p>
<p>And now Nanjing is also greatly suffering from the same terror. (Please readers be patient and listen to me quietly) According to Mr. Chen, who often goes to Nanjing on official business, the number of airplanes and armored vehicles in Nanjing is so large that you cannot count them. The residents of Nanjing are very worried because there are too many of them. Everyone has to suffer from the attack of airplanes and armored vehicles. The people of Nanjing compare mosquitoes to airplanes and bedbugs to armored vehicles.</p>
<p>It is also fortunate that they can think of it. These two small animals are really like the two weapons mentioned above. Airplanes squeak, mosquitoes buzz, and the same is circling over your head, and when there is a chance, they will nail you for a while (just like bombs under the plane), so that on your good flesh, there will be a little bit of red and itchy scars. (This is the area after the bomb falls) After the mosquito stings you, it flies away satisfied. It also works like an airplane. And the stupid armored vehicle is just like a bedbug. Slow progress, bulky body, but it is not easy to kill it. It cannot be drowned or starved to death. It nails when it sees meat, causing it to bulge, and it is poisonous and not easy to eliminate.</p>
<p>From this, we can see the degree of terror that the people of Nanjing have for mosquitoes and bedbugs. They actually compare them to these two weapons. As a joke, if all the mosquitoes and bedbugs in China were transformed into airplanes and armored vehicles, then China's strength could be expected in the near future, and the authority of the Great Republic of China would not only be deeply feared by the "bandit country," but also be the hero of the world. Because Mr. Chen told me this, I was filled with emotion, so I described it as above.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Preferential Treatment for Prisoners <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>It seems that two years ago, a White Russian vagrant in Shanghai, because he could not find bread, had a whimsical idea and broke the large glass on a shop window with a punch. After being sentenced to detention, he was very happy, because he could get temporary food, clothing, and shelter without cost. He said that after serving his sentence and being released, he would still use this method to solve his livelihood problem. Although the next time has not been resolved, "being sued" is one way to make a living, which is indeed the safest.</p>
<p>We have seen in recent years that prisons in various places are like large hotels in Shanghai, often with "full" signs hanging. At first, I thought that the public security personnel were serious in their work and miraculously solved cases, so there were so many prisoners. But after thinking carefully, it is not right. Among these prisoners, there must be countless "friends who eat for free" living in it. The country spends so much on prisoner rations every year, but it is used to supply these street bums who are not within the thirty-six lines and take being sued as a temporary occupation. It is really unjust.</p>
<p>A few days ago, someone accused a certain prison of deducting prisoner rations, and I was sweating in my palms, because once the prisoner rations were not deducted, the prisoners would be full. Although prisons are not a good place, friends who have no food to eat will not run to soup kitchens, but regard prisons as shelters. That would be terrible.</p>
<p>These days, it's even worse. I heard that prisoners get a national sexual release once after a considerable period of time. There is also a rumor that the interrogation of prisoners will be strictly prohibited. If it becomes a reality, then, of course, there will be no "slaps" when entering the door, let alone spanking or electric shocks. After entering prison, there is prisoner rations to eat, which can fill your belly, and you don't have to worry about being cold or hungry. Being full and warm, you can also go home for sex. Isn't it better than being away from home and not being able to get enough to eat?</p>
<p>If preferential treatment for prisoners is implemented, "friends who eat for free" will definitely feel at home. I don't know if the authorities have ten thousand mansions to accommodate them. If there is not enough time to rush to build prisons to accommodate them, then, I think it is better to have an exam, and only those who pass will be allowed to enter prison to enjoy food, clothing, and shelter, in order to show restrictions, which may be feasible.</p>

<p>— Chaoye</p>
<p>At the beginning of this summer, I accidentally received a special income. According to my wife's original intention, it was to be deposited in the bank for emergencies. In my opinion, it is better to buy a practical item than to keep it in the bank. When bright people come and go, I can use it to pretend to be decent, and also make a few familiar friends confused and in awe and envy. As a result, I bought a timely Huasheng desk fan. One day, the wife of my relative who studied in England deigned to visit me. After exchanging greetings, she first turned on the electric fan to show preferential treatment. Unexpectedly, the wife smiled and stopped it. I was terrified and killed the electricity. My wife asked suspiciously, "Is Mrs. So-and-so not hot?" The wife replied arrogantly, "I came by car, the sun can't reach me. This kind of Chinese electric fan is very noisy, I really can't get used to it. I have always used 'Emerson'."</p>
<p>The wife of a certain classmate who has not stepped out of the country's gate is particularly interested in "foreign" things. She doesn't wear yellow leather shoes that are not imported, and she must buy socks from the Shanghai Huiluo Company. There are really few domestic goods in the home, and the most incomprehensible thing is that she must eat Western food in summer. Because there are no authentic Western restaurants in Nanjing, she actually eats every day at the home of a certain Westerner in a certain oil company, and the monthly fee is slightly equal to the income of a first-class staff member. One day, a certain couple came to my residence. Because it was close to lunch time, my wife and I insisted on them having a meal. The wife said with a sad face, "We were originally going to have lunch at Mrs. Hutchinson's house, but because it was a little early, we came to your place to rest our feet. Besides, I never eat Chinese food in summer." After listening respectfully, I couldn't help but feel angry. In a hurry, I blurted out, "Then the dishes made by Mrs……'s family are all authentic imports?" The wife did not answer, but the classmate said "goodbye".</p>
<p>A friend of mine dined at my place one day. After the meal, we chatted. Later, he saw my gramophone, stood up, opened the box, and searched for records for a long time. I asked strangely, "Which one are you looking for?" He said, "I'm looking for 'Home is Home'." I had never heard of this record title before, and I didn't like listening to foreign records at all. Actually, I really couldn't understand it, so I apologized for not having it. The friend shrugged his shoulders, turned his palms, and laughed, saying, "Chinese records are for country bumpkins to listen to."</p>

<p>Chapter 14: It is difficult to get married, and I am worried about the future. Inviting friends to a small gathering to remember the past with embarrassment.</p>
<p>After a while, I only heard someone shouting outside the house: I brought a guest, who is the host, I am sorry. Zhao Ziqiang did not consider it and replied loudly: Miss Huang is willing to come, I am the host. Before he finished speaking, the curtain was lifted, and Huang Manying pulled someone in. It was not someone else, but Yang Guizhi. This was beyond Zhao Ziqiang's expectation. He was stunned and didn't know what to do. Guizhi's body was stiff when she lifted the curtain, and she wanted to run backwards. When Huang Manying pulled her inside the curtain, she straightened her face, nodded to Tian Qing, and also nodded to Zhao Ziqiang. She turned around and glared at Huang Manying and said: Didn't you say there were no outsiders? Huang Manying dragged a chair, pulled her to sit down, and smiled: Sit down, I don't know if there are outsiders or not. I and Company Commander Tian have always been regarded as insiders. As for who is an outsider and who is not an outsider, we don't have to argue about it. This time, Zhao Ziqiang was really stiff. Should he entertain them well, or should he not entertain them? He coughed lightly twice and tugged at his clothes, and then said to Manying: Miss Huang, what would you like to order? Originally, they were sitting at a long table. Zhao Ziqiang sat at the head of the table, Tian Qing sat on his left, and Manying Guizhi sat on his right. When he spoke to Manying, he could also say that he was talking to Guizhi. Manying said: I want to eat a bowl of yuanxiao. Miss Yang, what would you like to eat? When she said this, she first looked at Zhao Ziqiang, and then turned her head to smile at Guizhi. Guizhi thought to herself, if I answer shyly, they will say that I am stingy, so she straightened her chest and smiled slightly: I will also eat a bowl of yuanxiao. Huang Manying and Tian Qing applauded in unison. (177)</p>

<p>(1) The Fun of Lantern Competitions Ten years ago, in my childhood, I always liked to play with many children of similar ages! The playing methods were different because of the different seasons!</p>
<p>Making melon lanterns was not very popular because the weather was very hot, and we often liked to tell stories with many older sisters, younger sisters, older brothers, and younger brothers in summer nights; so, it was not very popular; when the weather got a little cooler, we would make many melon lanterns with many children, and go out in groups to compete with lanterns when the night god came!</p>
<p>Many children's hands were holding melon lanterns, which were arranged very neatly in front and back, which was very beautiful! Sometimes, everyone would walk and sing; the spirit of unity can be expressed here. Who says that the Chinese are like a plate of loose sand?</p>
<p>(2) How to Make a Melon Lantern</p>
<p>Whether it is a big watermelon or a small golden melon; the best is a kind called Banggua in Shanghai and Western watermelon in the countryside to make melon lanterns!</p>
<p>During the day, when eating watermelon, do not cut a watermelon into two halves; naturally! To make a melon lantern, you must make a watermelon shell like a beautiful lamp; so, when eating watermelon during the day, you only need to cut off a part of a watermelon at the end where the watermelon flower falls off, like a small basin, and then take out the heart inside with a spoon and eat it; scrape the inedible inner skin thinly to make it like a lamp shell, this is the first step! The second step is to make two wide and thin small bamboo strips into a cross shape and put them in the middle of the melon, but at the intersection of the two bamboo strips, you need to use a thin thread to make a pointed head for inserting candles!</p>
<p>Secondly, after cutting off a spoon-shaped piece, you need to evenly punch four holes on the edge, which is to tie four thin hemp threads to hang on a small bamboo pole!</p>
<p>Finally, light a candle inside the melon lantern, and you can hold the lamp in your hand and run around to play!</p>
<p>For more particular ones, many calligraphy and paintings are carved around the melon lantern, such as a double happiness, or the three characters of Fulu Shou, or the four characters of Tianxia Weigong, or other characters, or other painted scenes, etc.!</p>
<p>If the words and paintings of resisting Japan and saving the country are carved on the lamp, then it is more full of patriotic thoughts!</p>

<p>— Ye Yi</p>
<p>At the turn of summer and autumn, under the poplar trees or pumpkin leaves, there are many spinning ladies chirping at night; many families without gardens can go outside to catch a few spinning ladies to raise at home; but, where to raise them? The following are several ways to raise them:</p>
<p>1. Bamboo cage is made of fine bamboo silk; its shape and texture are the same as ordinary bird cages, but smaller! This kind of cage can be bought or made easily. Just use twelve thicker small bamboo sticks, about two inches long, to set up a square frame, and then drill many small holes on the bamboo sticks, and insert many fine bamboo silks! But it is a little troublesome to make</p>
<p>2. Lead wire cage is woven from many fine lead wires. As long as there is a place where a spinning lady can enter, it can be raised!</p>
<p>3. Leaf wire cage is woven from large bamboo leaves, and the method is the same as the lead wire cage! Just weave many thin bamboo threads vertically and horizontally, make six sides in total, and then sew them together with thin thread, and open a small door, and it's done!</p>
<p>4. Melon shell Use a small melon shell, cut off a little bit of the top, and then dig out the inside heart, and punch a few small holes thinly on the shell, and it becomes a golden cage for the spinning lady!</p>
<p>However, after the cage is made, what should the spinning lady eat? That is to pick a few pumpkin flowers and small edamame (soybeans) for it to eat in the morning, and it will be fine!</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Problem of Flooding in Collapsing Rural Areas <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Fan</p>
<p>Human survival is the result of constant struggle against nature. Agriculture, entirely a product of nature, has an even deeper relationship with it, and the struggle with nature is therefore particularly close.</p>
<p>China is a country that has based itself on agriculture for five thousand years. Its land is fertile and its products are abundant. This is not only something we have always been proud of, but our entire nation relies on this endowment to be well-fed and clothed, and to live a life of ease and leisure. But how did the land become so fertile? How can the products be so abundant? What we get from heaven is limited; the efforts and struggles of our ancestors account for the largest and most important part. If we open the history of any era and examine the industry of any place, all dikes, ditches, and even the construction of rivers, and the opening up of agricultural reclamation, have undergone decades or even hundreds of years of hard work before there can be considerable harvests. Otherwise, the vast wilderness is just barren land!</p>
<p>However, now, China's entire agriculture is collapsing. Not only are all farmers on the verge of starvation, but even the raw materials for the clothes we wear, such as cotton and cotton yarn, are imported from foreign countries at a value of two to three hundred million taels each year; the food we need every day, such as rice, wheat, and flour, are also imported at a value of two to three hundred million taels each year. Moreover, these imports are constant, long-term, and increasing year by year. The collapse of agriculture has led to a sharp increase in foreign imports, and this influx of imports has made it even more impossible for China's agriculture to be revived! This cycle continues until the entire Chinese nation perishes!</p>
<p>The reason for the collapse of China's rural areas and the massive import of foreign necessities is naturally very complex, but the Chinese government's failure to build water conservancy projects, and the exploitation of Chinese farmers at every level, leaving them unable to restore or resist natural disasters such as floods and droughts, can be said to be the most important reason. Moreover, it can also be said that the increasing severity of floods everywhere in China can be used to measure the deepening degree of the collapse of Chinese agriculture.</p>
<p>The great flood along the Yangtze River in the 20th year of the Republic of China affected sixteen provinces. According to the investigation by the Flood Relief Committee, the losses from the more severe disasters in only seven provinces – Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan – showed that the area actually affected by the flood and reported accounted for 32.5% of the total area; the flooded farmland reached 127,706,452 mu; the property loss was estimated at 1,575,330,360 yuan; and the number of disaster victims was 43,300,849, accounting for 25.9% of the total population of the above counties. (The above statistics are all based on the 1933 Shen Bao Yearbook, pages P70-71) The severity of the losses from this great flood can of course be said to be unprecedented. It not only affected the national economy and people's livelihood, but also the occurrence of the Manchurian Incident by Japanese imperialism was directly or indirectly foreshadowed or triggered by this great flood. As for last year, according to the investigation, it was the year with the lightest disasters in the past five years; however, the floods in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Yunnan, and other provinces, the various disasters of floods, droughts, wind, hail, and black frost in Shaanxi, the breaches of various rivers in Hebei, and the combination of floods followed by droughts in Jiangxi, also affected as many as seven provinces. Moreover, because of the impact of the great flood in the previous year, the rice-producing provinces encountered a bumper harvest, but the price of grain was very low, and the suffering of the farmers was even more severe than in the year of the disaster!</p>
<p>As for this year, fortunately, the danger of the Yangtze River in June and July barely passed; however, recently, due to the breach of the Yellow River, more than one hundred counties in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces were affected; (August 30th Chen Bao) The breach of the river embankment in Hua County, Henan Province, submerged more than 6,000 square li, totaling more than 600 villages; (September 1st Shen Bao) The floods in Xiangxiang County, Changde, Lingling, Huarong, and other counties in Hunan Province submerged 300,000 to 400,000 mu of farmland (July 22nd Chen Bao). In the past two months alone, there have been records in the newspapers almost every day. It is estimated that as many as sixteen provinces have been affected by the disaster, and the number of victims has reached 100 million (August 17th Shi Shi Xin Bao). Although the amount of loss is not as huge as that in the 20th year of the Republic of China, it is definitely not small!</p>
<p>Mallory said that between 108 BC and 1911 AD, China had 1,828 famines. In other words, every year, at least one of China's eighteen provinces had a famine. If we compare his statistics with the current situation, we don't know how much the expansion of the famine has differed. Moreover, the examples he cited included all disasters such as floods, droughts, wars, bandits, wind, frost, and insect pests in China. Zhu Kezhen, in his "Climatic Changes in China Since Historical Times," published statistics on floods and droughts that occurred every hundred years from the early Tang Dynasty to the early 20th century. In particular, floods were most frequent during the Yuan and Qing dynasties; but this is naturally incomparable to recent years, and we can know the obvious relationship between politics and disaster here.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, famines have been more frequent and widespread. The Huai River flooded in 1913, submerging 10,470 square miles in Anhui and 2,300 square miles in Jiangsu; the great flood in Jiangxi in 1924 turned hundreds of square miles of fertile land near Ganzhou into a swamp; along the Yellow River, 80,000 square miles of land were submerged in 1925; in 1927, the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were flooded by tens of thousands of square miles. These tragic stories are all in our latest memories. In this famine-stricken China, the disaster of 1931 will inevitably expand even more. Although the great flood of 1931 has passed, the disaster of 1933 is coming. And the disasters in the future will only become more and more intense; the periodic law of labor pains will become shorter and shorter! China's agriculture, which has been painstakingly built for thousands of years, will inevitably be completely destroyed in a few years, and the entire Chinese nation will inevitably collapse completely with this flood!</p>
<p>We have already said that the arrival of this flood is a manifestation of the collapse of China's rural areas; and the collapse of rural areas is the cause of this flood. Therefore, if we want to save our own nation, we must first revive China's rural areas, and at the same time, we must restore water conservancy and works related to water conservancy. In conclusion, if we want to survive, we should fight against nature; as for the necessary items that must be prepared before fighting against nature, we should naturally actively prepare for them, and this goes without saying.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Water Conservancy and Floods <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— He Bing</p>
<p>㈠ The Role of Water Conservancy in the Economy</p>
<p>Varga believed that without water conservancy in China, there would be no agriculture. Ma Jia's research on China's rural economy also focused on the role of water conservancy in the economy. The distribution of the natural environment in the provinces of mainland China can be roughly divided into two major regions, namely the Loess Plateau and the Paddy Field Region. Loess is distributed in Hebei, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, Gansu, and the northern and southern counties of Shandong and Henan. These areas are historical treasures of China. Loess is a soil that has been soaked by rivers for a long time and accumulated and precipitated. It can absorb rainwater. This water, in the deepest place, encounters the wet air in the lowest layer of the soil, which is rich in nutrients. Through capillary action, it rises to the surface and brings all the nutrients from the bottom of the earth to the surface. Therefore, loess itself can be used as fertilizer, and the soil is often very fertile. However, these advantages of loess must have sufficient water to be expressed. Without sufficient water, the capillary action that occurs on the surface and underground will stop, and plants will not get nutrients. Precious loess will become a barren land.</p>
<p>The southern paddy field area naturally needs even more water. The main plant in the paddy field area is rice. The characteristics of rice, as Professor Copeland said, "Rice needs nourishment and respiration just like other plants. If you want to promote the realization of this essential process, there must be water... If the water supply in those places is very complete, then the growth of rice does not need rain. But in addition to insufficient water, rice is sometimes damaged by too much water..." Therefore, in China, water conservancy is undoubtedly a factor that determines the prosperity or decline of agriculture. On the one hand, it needs water, and on the other hand, it prevents too much water.</p>
<p>In China, water conservancy almost occurred at the same time as agriculture. After the Spring and Autumn Period, irrigation methods gradually became popular. The Historical Records of Rivers and Canals states: "Ximen Bao diverted the Zhang River to irrigate Ye, in order to enrich the area within the He River of Wei." This is not without reason. For example, the strength of Qin was due to the opening of the Zheng Guo Canal.</p>
<p>Today, the abundance and decline, high and low prices of agricultural products and land in China are largely determined by water conservancy. In the Weibei Plain area of Shaanxi, "It is said that in the past, the opening of the Zheng Guo Canal turned barren land into fertile land, and Guanzhong has never had a bad year since then. Later generations continued, and the rise and fall of water conservancy led to the prosperity and decline of land productivity and products" (quoted from "China Rural Economic Materials," page 763). In most parts of Suiyuan Province, "the growth of crops almost entirely depends on the irrigation of rivers and canals. Because irrigation can increase yields and ensure a harvest, land prices are also very different?" (ibid., page 1149).</p>

<p>In the relationship where water conservancy determines most of agricultural production, water is naturally blessable for ordinary farmers. Farmers often cherish water more than expected. For example, in Sichuan, there are many good paddy fields that are only cultivated for one season, and are left idle in winter. The reason is the lack of water. As Dong Shijin's investigation showed, "After the rice harvest in Sichuan, if the water is drained and dry crops are planted, it is feared that there will be a shortage of water in the fields in the spring of the following year, and seedlings cannot be transplanted. The loss will be great, so it is impossible not to store water in advance from autumn. This is the biggest reason why farmers dare not grow dry crops in winter" (ibid., page 821).</p>
<p>Since water is so precious, struggles for water are inevitable. For example, in Hunan Province, "Due to the drought this year, farmers often fight and even litigate for water... There is no fixed standard for the time of water rotation. Those who are strong and powerful often take too much" (ibid., page 1113). In Shanxi, the water distribution system is very impressive. The water flowing through a village is owned by that village. "The method of using water is stipulated according to the village and the period. Some use ten days as a period, or half a month as a period... The customs of Zhaocheng and Yuci counties are relatively fierce. Often, villages downstream and villages upstream fight for water, and there are often murder cases" (ibid., page 755). Storms of fighting for water and preventing floods occur everywhere. For example, as reported in the Da Wan Bao in June last year and the Shi Shi Xin Bao on July 5, farmers in Xiaoxian County, Jiangsu, and Suxian County, Anhui, even had a fight of two to three thousand people for water. The Chen Bao Xin Ye Bao on July 11 this year had the following record of the water dispute in Shanxi Province:</p>
<p>"Villagers in Nanhongdong, Zhaocheng, and other counties often fight each other for water to irrigate their fields in the summer, causing disputes and fights. Many villagers on both sides have died under wooden, iron, and firearms... Since the beginning of summer this year, various counties have suffered from drought, resulting in residents of Beiying and Pingquan villages in Qingyuan County engaging in a fierce fight on the 6th and 7th of last month (June) over water for irrigation. Pingquan Village, with its large population and strength, used a repeating rifle to kill one villager from Beiying Village, and seventeen people were lightly or seriously injured."</p>
<p>㈢ Water Conservancy Construction</p>
<p>Although Chinese farmers need water so urgently, small farmers are unable to carry out large-scale irrigation systems. Water conservancy construction is a social undertaking. Farmers who cultivate a few mu or even dozens of mu of land not only do not have the ability, but also cannot build a water conservancy system themselves. Therefore, water conservancy construction can only be expected from the central and local governments.</p>
<p>In Chinese history, one of the important responsibilities of so-called good central governments or local upright officials was to build water conservancy. Only by building water conservancy can they gain the support of the people. During the Han Dynasty, "Shao Fu Du Mu" is still praised as a good story. As the Later Han Dynasty Book records:</p>
<p>"During the reign of Emperor Yuan, Shao Xin Chen was the governor of Nanyang. Sixty miles south of Rang County, he built the Qianlu Pool... to expand irrigation. It increased year by year, reaching 30,000 qing. The people benefited from it. Later, Du Shi, as governor of the Later Han, restored his business. At that time, people sang: There was Shao Fu before, and Du Mu after."</p>
<p>The custom of farmers worshiping water conservancy builders still exists today. Professor Bai Lang was very surprised when he investigated rural Sichuan: "The creators of this kind of large irrigation system are respected by farmers as gods, and are worshiped with solemn ceremonies. The rules for supplying water have also become a major religious ritual for the people of the area, and the canals are cleaned once a year" ("Materials," page 859).</p>
<p>Because of the importance of water conservancy to agriculture, governments of all dynasties attached special importance to it and established special officials to manage it. Special rewards were given to local officials who made contributions to water conservancy construction. The rapid growth of the Chinese nation can be said to be directly proportional to water conservancy construction. In the past, when Westerners came to China and saw the greatness of our country's water conservancy construction, they all sighed and praised it. For example, Li Shufen, after seeing the convenience and regulations of China's irrigation facilities, sighed at it as a miracle of mankind and recorded it. For example, the original dikes of the Yellow River, the water networks in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River were all agricultural facilities rarely seen in various countries around the world.</p>
<p>㈣ "Water Disaster"</p>
<p>Agriculture's relationship with water is two-sided. On the one hand, it needs water for irrigation, and on the other hand, it needs to prevent water damage. Therefore, water conservancy construction has two aspects: one is to popularize the irrigation system, and the other is to prevent flood damage. In other words, water is blessable ("happy water") within the appropriate degree, but it can also become a curse ("disaster water") at the wrong time.</p>
<p>Since water conservancy construction cannot be undertaken by individual farmers, it must rely on the government. Therefore, the clarity of politics is directly proportional to the construction of water conservancy, and political changes can affect the changes in water conservancy. Ouyang Xiu recorded the relationship between the opening of ditches and politics in the Geography of the Tang Book:</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, those before the Tianbao era accounted for seven tenths. Isn't it because in the era of peace, official governance was repaired and the people's concealment was revealed, so officials often created benefits for thousands of years? As for after the use of troops in Hebei, the priority was to urge the payment of taxes, and there was no time to study agricultural work and waterways?"</p>
<p>Molay, in his book "The Nile and Egyptian Civilization," also quoted Napoleon as saying: If the national administration is good, the river channels will be repaired, the river tides will be regulated fairly, and the irrigation will benefit many people; if the administration is bad, corrupt, and weak, the river channels will be silted up, the dikes will not be repaired, and not only will they not benefit, but they will also overflow and cause endless harm.</p>
<p>The frequent occurrence of floods in China today has its origins.</p>
<p>First, after the Republic of China, it cannot be said that there are no special officials for water management, but they are equivalent to being set up in vain. On the active side, the irrigation system cannot be popularized, and on the passive side, the dikes cannot be built to prevent water. Although there is a slight amount of water conservancy funding, the result is just to create some corrupt historical facts. Not to mention the causes of the Yangtze River flood in the 19th year, there is also news about the Yellow River breach today:</p>
<p>"The Shen Bao reported on August 28 this year: "The dike funds in Hubei Province have not been cleared for several years, and encroachment and misappropriation are regarded as commonplace. The occurrence of the flood in the previous year completely revealed this secret... Long-term negligence led to repeated cases of encroachment and misappropriation. In addition to Mao Zhongcai, the supervisor of Changyueguan... who encroached and misappropriated dike funds and fled without a trace... secondly... and other cases, the amount of deficit was relatively large. County magistrates, directors of finance bureaus, and directors of collection bureaus in various counties, who defaulted on or misappropriated donations, amounted to more than ten thousand..."</p>
<p>Second, construction is impossible, but there is more than enough destruction. The most powerful thing to destroy water conservancy is war, and wars have been constant in China in recent years. Not to mention the unintentional destruction in the war, there are also many who use water as a means of attack and defense. The Shi Shi Xin Bao reported on May 23 this year:</p>
<p>"Liu Wenhui's troops occupied Chongning on the 17th, and Huang Yin's troops retreated to Guanxian, breaching the dikes and defending to the death. More than a dozen counties along the river were flooded, and crops were submerged, which is worrying for agricultural affairs.</p>
<p>"Liu Wenhui issued a second order on the 19th to launch a general attack on Deng's army. The battles in Jinmacheng Qinggangshu in Guanxian were fierce. Liu failed to cross the river and ordered the Jiangdeng Weir to be destroyed to reduce the water flow of the Pi River, but the water in the outer river rose, and all counties along the river were affected by the water..."</p>
<p>Third, not only that, but sometimes, even "disaster relief" is impossible. The Shen Bao reported on August 28 this year with a notable message, that is, the telegram from the disaster victims in 18 counties in western Shandong said:</p>
<p>"...Since the breach of the long dike in Hebei, we are deeply worried about the flood entering Shandong, and people are panicked and shocked several times a day, but the breach was caused by bandits, who do not care about national law. Hearing this, we are excited and helpless. It is not unique, but more and more strange. The Henan Provincial Government openly sent a brigade of troops to Landui to breach the dike and flood the area. The Landui River dike was breached that night, and the flood flowed horizontally, pouring into western Shandong... a dozen counties and the Cao Ning area..."</p>
<p>These are not accidental or exceptional "examples," but are they universal phenomena?</p>
<h3 id="e216">Highways and Water Conservancy <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Duan Sheng</p>
<p>"Rather than building more highways, why not invest more in water conservancy?" This has been a recent argument made by some. I believe that it reflects an understanding of the vital importance of water conservancy. In my opinion, our nation's road infrastructure has been neglected for too long, leading to poor transportation and inconveniences, which has hindered cultural, industrial, and commercial development. Especially with the advancement of military tactics and sophisticated weaponry, the use of heavy artillery, supply trains, and offensive vehicles relies on extensive and direct roads. Therefore, highway construction is essential for national defense and pacification efforts and cannot be delayed. However, those who advocate for water conservancy have their own perspectives, arising not just from the recent Yangtze River floods and Yellow River overflows, nor from opposition to highway construction, but from considerations of the nation's economy and people's livelihoods. They argue:</p>
<p>(1) Considering Agriculture and Food Supply</p>
<p>Agriculture thrives when there is timely rain and sunshine, ensuring smooth development and bountiful harvests. If this is not the case, it is hoped that there are ways to regulate droughts and floods to minimize crop losses. While timely rain and sunshine are gifts of nature beyond human control, droughts and floods, though natural occurrences, can be mitigated through human efforts. Developing water conservancy and dredging rivers and canals can prevent floods, alleviate waterlogging during prolonged rains, and mitigate droughts. Due to the lack of water conservancy in our country, rivers and canals cannot contain floodwaters, leading to overflows. Prolonged rains cause water accumulation and submersion. In times of drought, the earth cracks, and crops wither due to lack of irrigation. "Easy to flood when it rains, easy to drought during dry spells" is the most profound suffering of Chinese agriculture and the reason why food supply is often insecure. Therefore, if China wants to revitalize rural areas and solve the food problem, there is nothing more urgent than water conservancy. Water conservancy benefits both transportation and agriculture. Prosperous agriculture leads to affluent farmers, affluent farmers lead to a stable society, a solid national foundation, and a solution to the food problem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, highway construction can potentially harm rural areas. While providing convenience for national construction, highway routes may disrupt rivers and harbors, and divide land and fields. If handled properly, with the construction of culverts and bridges, farmland can still be irrigated. However, to save costs, farmland water conservancy is often disregarded. Land that has been requisitioned is promised compensation, but payment is delayed indefinitely. Even after land has been requisitioned, farmers are not exempted from land taxes and must still bear the obligation to pay taxes. While this is due to the misconduct of contractors, it is unrelated to the highways themselves. However, instead of causing grievances among the people, why not allocate some of the funds for highway construction to water conservancy, so that farmers sing praises like in the days of Emperors Yao and Shun?</p>
<p>(2) Considering the Needs of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce</p>
<p>It is generally believed that completed highways facilitate traffic, transportation, and travel, boosting industry, commerce, and agriculture. However, reality may not meet expectations. (1) Taking agriculture as an example, although Shanghai and its surrounding areas have a network of roads, agricultural products are not transported by vehicles as much as expected. The reason is that highways often pass through remote villages and towns, reducing their utility. (2) From the perspective of industry and commerce, besides transportation, the benefits of highways are no different for farmers. How many freight transport businesses operate on the completed highways, and how is their business? Do industries and businesses along the highways use vehicles, especially automobiles, for transportation? While this argument may be biased towards the South, even in the North, where carts and horses are common, few have the financial means to use automobiles for transportation. Given this situation across the North and South, the utility of highways, apart from military transportation and political communication, is limited to a few people "enjoying leisure on their days off" or facilitating travel for those with more wealth.</p>
<p>(3) Considering Plugging Loopholes</p>
<p>In recent years, the export of domestic goods has declined, while the import of foreign goods has penetrated every corner of the country. The trade deficit increases year by year, leading to rural bankruptcy and economic hardship. Highway construction promotes the sale of foreign goods. This statement may seem alarmist, but it is true. From the tools used for road construction to automobiles, from screws and nails to engines, generators, axles, tires, and decorative materials like paint, wood, and glass, almost everything is foreign-made. The construction of a highway and the use of automobiles create business for foreign factories and commissions for foreign companies. No wonder foreigners praise China's highway construction as a sign of civilization and progress. The biggest drain is gasoline. Cars cannot run without gas, and gas is consumed as it is used. Over time, the consumption is astonishing. The price war among British, American, and Russian oil companies shows the bright future of oil, and the competition will intensify. Although the price drop benefits us temporarily, it will ultimately cause endless harm. In contrast, water conservancy, river dredging, and boating, though slow, have no such drains. Even the use of steamboats is not comparable to the dependence on foreign goods of automobiles. Therefore, the greatest loss from highway construction and automobile use is the reliance on imported materials, vehicles, and gasoline. The more highways built, the bigger the drain. In today's economy, we should conserve foreign goods and use domestic goods. How can we build highways without considering the harm?</p>
<p>(4) Considering Highway Usage</p>
<p>Recent highways are often poorly built due to cost-cutting and haste. They are rough and uneven, causing vehicles to shake, making them prone to damage and requiring costly maintenance. They primarily serve passengers and not freight, offering little benefit to agriculture, industry, and commerce. In the North, where carts and horses are common, highway construction is a convenient adaptation. However, in the South, with its many ports and rivers, where boats have traditionally been the mode of transportation, building highways while neglecting water conservancy is unwise.</p>
<p>The above are the arguments of those who advocate for water conservancy over highway construction. I believe that highway construction should proceed with the progress of the times without hesitation. However, with the country facing crises and disasters, rural bankruptcy, empty households, and people in dire straits, it is crucial to prioritize the people's livelihood. Every effort should be made to conserve the nation's vitality and reduce waste. All construction should be based on the needs of the majority, the urgency, the social situation, and the global trends. While highways and automobiles are useful for transportation and are common in Europe and America, promoting highways to embrace Western civilization, improve China's road infrastructure, and develop agriculture, industry, and commerce is not objectionable. However, can China's industries, customs, and circumstances be the same as those in Europe and America? If not, we should embrace the trends while considering our social situation. If we must build more highways as the foundation of construction, we should strive for self-sufficiency in vehicles, materials, and gasoline. Otherwise, even with highways as dense as spiderwebs, money will continue to flow to Southeast Asia, Europe, and America.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Deep Disaster! <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Amidst the soaring rhetoric of the "Rural Revitalization Movement," as a portion of the fifty million U.S. dollar cotton and wheat loan is about to be allocated for rural revitalization, the Yellow River, as if descending from the heavens, rages from Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu, its momentum no less than the Yangtze River flood of 1931. The flood victims, already numbering three million, exceed twice the number of industrial laborers who constitute China's labor problem.</p>
<p>This year can be described as a "nation beset by numerous disasters." Starting in June, the Yangtze River began to swell, once even surging onto the banks, with water several feet deep in the Hankou area. Fortunately, it did not continue to rise as in 1931, but the danger was imminent. At the same time, various counties in Shanxi also reported floods, while in various counties in Shaanxi, "rats are larger than cats." In the Xuhai region of Jiangsu, "locusts swarmed through." Combined with the Yellow River breaching its banks, the affected counties not yet included, the following areas have suffered disasters:</p>
<p>(1) Hunan Province: Floods and droughts</p>
<p>(2) Henan Province: Floods, droughts, hail, frost, wind, locusts, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Shaanxi Province: Droughts, frost, wind, hail, ice, epidemics, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Hubei Province: Floods and droughts</p>
<p>(5) Anhui Province: Wind, floods, and hail</p>
<p>(6) Gansu Province: Droughts, epidemics, and earthquakes</p>
<p>(7) Zhejiang Province: Floods</p>
<p>(8) Jiangxi Province: Floods</p>
<p>(9) Hebei Province: Floods</p>
<p>(10) Guizhou Province: Droughts, hail, and floods</p>
<p>(11) Fujian Province: Droughts, floods, and wind</p>
<p>(12) Sichuan Province: Floods</p>
<p>(13) Jiangsu Province: Floods and locusts</p>
<p>(14) Qinghai Province: Droughts</p>
<p>These are still considered "minor disasters" that, in the past, would have been recorded in history books, with emperors issuing edicts "blaming themselves." But since the Republic, they have become commonplace. However, the Yellow River breach in July, which is now raging and inundating Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong, extending to Jiangsu, creating three to four million victims, is a serious event even in today's disaster-stricken times.</p>
<p>In the past, just as ancient Egyptian civilization relied on the Nile River for development, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers contributed significantly to the rapid growth and development of the Chinese nation. But today, the Yangtze River floods annually, becoming a "scourge" for the central region's residents. And now, the Yellow River has become a true "Yellow Peril." In reality, it's not just the Yellow River; every river beneficial to our lives can suddenly turn into a scourge.</p>
<p>The characteristic of civilized people is the ability to overcome the harms of nature and utilize natural resources, but the Chinese people of the 20th century have reverted to the lives of the prehistoric era. Famines occur every year, and flood prevention, disaster relief, and rescue have become old tunes. Disaster prevention is not difficult, but it is also the most difficult. The Yellow River water conservancy projects, once famous in history and admired by foreigners, are now completely destroyed! While the water conservancy projects are constantly destroyed, we hope that disaster prevention and flood control measures can be effective. The key lies in whether the political system can get back on track.</p>
<p>The disaster is deep! The people are suffering! Relief efforts for the river disaster are still in their initial stages. In the past three days, eight typhoons have hit the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, all rice and cotton-producing regions. The extent of the damage is still unknown. If the damage is severe, it will add insult to injury, and rural recovery will be even more distant. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention to this.</p>

<p>丨Sudden Rises and Falls, Minor Fluctuations丨</p>
<p>During the week of August 28th to September 2nd, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange remained lackluster. Although the September futures contracts have been settled and the October contracts have been launched, and Finance Minister Song has returned home with accolades, and there are rumors of restructuring of the 96 bonds, the trading volume has not improved, and the prices have not changed. The increasing rebellions in Fujian province have dampened the spirits. The market has been hovering and brewing for almost a month. With such a long period of dormancy, any change in the environment will cause a rapid and significant price fluctuation. Therefore, both investors and speculators are extremely cautious, making the market even more sluggish. The results of the Lushan Conference will have a significant impact on the market. On Monday, only the September contracts were traded. Due to Finance Minister Song's return, the market showed some activity, but with sudden rises and falls, the trend was still inconsistent, and prices only slightly improved by 0.2-0.3 yuan. On Tuesday, October futures contracts were added. Although several types of bonds were launched, the prices were relatively firm, but still with alternating rises and falls. On Wednesday, the August futures contracts were settled, and the market was closed for the day. The settlement amount was over 31 million, which was quite smooth. On Thursday, prices initially fell due to the rampant communist bandits, but then rebounded due to Finance Minister Song's speech, resulting in a slight improvement of 0.2-0.3 yuan. On Friday, the market weakened again. Due to buying of the 41 bonds, prices initially improved slightly but eventually declined again by 0.2-0.3 yuan. On Saturday, there were rumors of restructuring of the 96 bonds, and the prices of various bonds rose slightly by 0.1-0.2 yuan following the 96 bonds, but the 96 bonds only rose by 0.3 yuan. As a result, prices for the week improved slightly by 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.6-0.7 yuan. The total trading volume was only 25,015,000 yuan, including 10,000 yuan of spot goods, 8,930,000 yuan of futures for unified salt tax, 2,280,000 yuan for troop reduction bonds, 2,100,000 yuan for 1929 customs bonds, and 4,455,000 yuan for 2020 bonds and 2020 customs bonds. The 96 bonds accounted for five days and eight liang. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to 700,000-800,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e224">A Discussion on New and Old Medicine <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Tianyi</p>
<p>(Reprinted from the Dagongbao Medical Weekly)</p>
<p>Recently, various newspapers have frequently discussed new and old medicine. At first glance, it seems like making a mountain out of a molehill; upon closer consideration, it concerns the rise and fall of science and the strength or weakness of the nation, so we cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>Before discussing this issue, let us first talk about the evolution of the wheel. The handcart was the beginning of the carriage, but the carriage is not comparable to the handcart. In recent years, the inventions of trains, automobiles, and trams are vastly different from carriages, let alone comparable to handcarts. If you were to ask a passerby, which is better for heavy loads and long distances, convenience and easy access, a train or a cart? I dare say they would undoubtedly answer a train. Why is medicine any different? Before the Zhou and Qin dynasties, only acupuncture and moxibustion were mentioned. At the end of the Han dynasty, herbal medicine began to rise. During the Tang dynasty, Buddhist medicine was introduced. In the Song dynasty, it was mixed with Neo-Confucianism. The four masters of the Jin and Yuan dynasties were prosperous for a time, but gradually declined in the Ming and Qing dynasties. In recent centuries, new medicine began to enter China. Therefore, the records of the Inner Canon and Treatise on Febrile Diseases, compared with today's new medicine, are no different from handcarts and carriages. Is it necessary to wait and think before making a judgment?</p>
<p>Some argue that old medicine has inherited thousands of years of tradition and must have its value. They do not know that the reason it has survived to this day is that no better medicine has been introduced to replace it. If handcarts had no carriages or other vehicles invented, their continued use would be unquestionable. Similarly, if the New World had not been discovered and inhabited by Europeans, it would still belong to black people, and their entrenched habits would still be ancient and unchanged. Everything must be compared to determine superiority or inferiority. If superiority and inferiority are distinguished, the superior will survive. Whether medicine stands in society, whether new or old, cannot escape this natural law of evolution.</p>
<p>Most Chinese people hold ancient prejudices and are full of xenophobic ideas. This is a characteristic of our nation inherited for thousands of years. Therefore, there is nothing surprising about the current opposition to new medicine. Here are some historical materials from the Ming and Qing dynasties. I wonder what readers will think!</p>
<p>(1) In the late Ming dynasty, due to the discovery of errors in the Datong calendar, in the late Wanli period, Matteo Ricci, Viegode Pangja, Sabatthirusde Ursis and other foreigners were tasked with revising the calendar. Xu Yuanhu, Li Liang'an and others supported them. At that time, the conflict between new and old was very fierce, most notably Wei Wenkui and Leng Shouzhong. During the Qing dynasty, during the Shunzhi and Kangxi periods, the German Johann Adam Schall von Bell was in charge of the Qin Tian Jian (Imperial Astronomical Bureau). Yang Guangxian and others vehemently criticized the new method, spare no effort. He wrote a book called "Bu De Yi Shu" (Book of Necessity). Later, Yang replaced Tang and took his position. Soon after, he was dismissed for inaccurate calculations, and the controversy subsided.</p>
<p>(2) In the fourth year of the Tongzhi reign in the Qing dynasty, the Englishman Durand built a railway outside Xuanwumen in Beijing, but it was ordered to be demolished due to public opposition. In the thirteenth year, the British company Ewo built the Songhu Railway, but it was eventually bought back and destroyed due to opposition from Feng Jun'guang and Shen Baozhen. In the sixth year of the Guangxu reign, Li Hongzhang requested the construction of the Tangxu Railway. Before the trains had run for long, officials repeatedly impeached him, and after much difficulty, it was finally opened to traffic. At that time, the opponents used the reasons that it was making trouble out of nothing, disturbing the imperial tombs, and that the black smoke emitted was harmful to crops. This remains a point of discussion today.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that in the dispute between new and old, what is right for them is also wrong, and what is wrong for them is also right. The new develops step by step, and the old struggles to survive. This is inevitable and natural. When things change, the superior wins and the inferior loses. The evolutionary pattern is unavoidable, it is certain to happen. What the structure and form of handcarts and carriages are like, I am afraid that few people in this world know.</p>
<p>However, we must give some sincere advice to new medical students, that is, do not fail to live up to your important mission of relieving suffering and strengthening the nation. When Matteo Ricci and others were introduced during the Ming dynasty, how precise was their knowledge of calendrical calculations, but without the promotion and development of Xu and Li, their achievements might not have been so great. Xu Guangqi wrote "Gougu Yi" (The Meaning of Right-Angled Triangles), and Liang'an wrote "Tongwen Suanzhi Huangu Rongjiao Yi" (The Mathematical Canon in Nine Sections), making considerable inventions in calendrical calculations, not just following blindly. Moreover, Guangqi said that to surpass, one must understand everything. Today, the number of people in our country who study new medicine is gradually increasing. How many of them can understand everything? How many can surpass? Following the instructions of the book, I wonder if it can avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has been heard that there are still some people in new medicine whose knowledge is insufficient, who are at a loss when they see diseases, or who demand money for treatment, acting like wandering quacks, or who do not pay attention to their behavior, causing people to criticize them. Although these are few, they are all obstacles to the development of new medicine. Therefore, we hope that those who are engaged in this profession will recognize the nobility of their profession and the importance of their responsibility, study academic knowledge thoroughly, seek to understand everything in order to surpass, cultivate personal morality, care about people's opinions and protect their position, be sincere in their hearts and manifest it externally, let their virtue increase daily, and achieve remarkable results. So that those who know will be convinced, and even those who used to criticize new medicine will no longer be able to hold different opinions due to the consensus of the public. From then on, new medical knowledge will be practiced throughout the country, so that the mysterious and boring old theories, like handcarts and carriages, will disappear from the world. Wouldn't that be the great fortune of our nation? New medical students, do you think my words are right? I feel compelled to speak so sincerely because of my deep love. It is also a strike of the morning bell.</p>
<h3 id="e225">A Discussion on Jiao Yitang's "Letter to the Nation on the Adoption of National Medicine Regulations" (Continued) <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "In addition, cold should be treated with heat, and heat should be treated with cold. Although the Inner Canon also says this, national doctors are not rigid about it. Unexpectedly, Western doctors got it right. We know that the high fever phenomenon of general febrile diseases is often a reaction to the toxins of physiological functions. It is appropriate to fully exert their effects. Western doctors actually use ice packs to disperse them, and the phenomenon of high fever clearly decreases, but life is also in danger." I think this statement needs further discussion. Mr. Jiao's reason that "the reaction of physiological function of mildew" is not found in your national doctors' books. Of course, this is the word of scientific medicine. Mr. Jiao knows this reason, wouldn't the Western doctors who use ice packs know it? Since they know this reason, they will come to use ice packs. Of course, at that time, there are more appropriate conditions for the disease than this reason, and then it is necessary to use ice packs. Let me tell Mr. Jiao a rough idea: First, if the high fever lasts for a long time, the brain will be damaged! The locals call it "thermal obstruction", especially for children and the elderly, they cannot withstand high fever. Second, during high fever, the heart works very vigorously. If it is too vigorous, it will be tired and weak! Therefore, when we encounter patients with long-term high fever, we must consider the patient's brain and heart, and must not allow the side effects caused by high fever to increase the disease and lose their lives. However, the simplest, most effective, most harmless, and most controllable method for dealing with high fever and regulating high fever is the ice pack. The national psychology is most afraid of wind and cold, but they don't know the awesomeness of heat. In summer, when they suffer from fever, the air temperature is as high as 36 or 37 degrees Celsius, and the patient's body temperature is as high as 40 degrees Celsius. At that time, they still have to follow the nonsense that "wind is the leader of all diseases", closing the windows tightly and not allowing air to circulate, steaming the patient into a coma, and still not letting go. We often encounter this kind of erroneous custom and uneducated behavior in society. Teaching them to open windows and circulate air is already shocking. If they are taught to use ice, wouldn't they be scared to death? This is really a case of "summer insects cannot talk about ice." Unexpectedly, Mr. Jiao also holds this view and makes this statement. It seems that the discussion of academic principles is too rigid and lacks understanding?</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao wanted to attack our ice packs, and he was afraid that we would use the words of the Inner Canon "cold should be treated with heat, and heat should be treated with cold" to refute him. So he used the slippery words "national doctors are not rigid about it" to lightly cover it up. Alas! Mr. Jiao is too clever. From the perspective of academic principles, rigidity has the academic principles of rigidity, and non-rigidity has the academic principles of non-rigidity. When should one be rigid, and when should one not be rigid, must be based on academic principles. Those national doctors who are uncivilized, have no good equipment, and are not good at diagnosis, are simply blind people riding blind horses, bumping around. They don't even deserve the word "rigidity". What is the possibility of "non-rigidity"? Please stop deceiving the people with words that go beyond the track of academic principles!</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "Secondly, the poverty of medicine, knowing what disease it is, but not knowing what medicine to use, because there are many medicines that Western doctors don't have at all. They have to wait for foreign countries to invent them. The sooner foreign countries invent them, the sooner they can use them. The later foreign countries invent them, the longer they have to wait to use them. If foreign countries never invent them in their lifetime, they can only look at the patient and hope for the best. The most common examples are typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and leprosy. How can there be a specific medicine for any of them? Especially for leprosy, they are isolated and live apart. There is no way to do anything except wait for death." Scientific doctors should accept this accusation! Because the position of scientific doctors is scientific research, and it is the mission of invention, but Mr. Jiao, listen, people of the country! What is research, what is invention? The special characteristic of barbaric and semi-civilized peoples is to regard research and invention as very easy. Mr. Jiao, listen, people of the country! Research and invention are not vague and casual things. They require research places, research time, and research capital. The country and society do not know how to promote true learning, and they do not know how to support true scholars, so that a group of scholars with research skills, research literacy, and research skills are idle in society and are busy with food and clothing. How can they have the time and money to do research? As for schools, if the person who is the principal is not slippery and does not think of other methods, and runs the school seriously by relying on the education fees from the government, I am afraid that even the professors' salaries will be owed, and they still want to establish research rooms and allocate research funds? Unless they disregard the name of the national school, do not support the central stage, and indiscriminately donate money from foreign consortia and enclose land, they can still operate a little. Otherwise, there is simply no way to implement it. Under this situation, what research and invention can be talked about? The personnel of the government should deeply apologize to the academic institutions and to the domestic experts, then they will be considered to have a conscience. It's strange and ridiculous that Mr. Jiao, who has been an official for many years, turned around and declared to the people of the country, accusing us of not researching and not inventing. Mr. Jiao, research and invention are things that come at a price. You can't get something for nothing. Is it that your national doctors say that stroke is fire in the theory of Hejian, and Dongyuan will say that it is qi, and Danxi will say that it is phlegm, and talking about soldiers on paper can be regarded as research and invention? Scientists are not allowed to play tricks and do not want to talk empty words. It is not that they are afraid of hiding it from the people of the country, but that they are afraid of laughing at the world and ridiculing those who know, leaving a stain on the academic circles of our country!</p>
<p>Furthermore, domestic experts have already published considerable achievements in small research and small inventions, but Mr. Jiao just doesn't see them. But Mr. Jiao wants to blame all the difficult-to-treat diseases on modern medical scientists to invent specific medicines. Otherwise, he says that they are just looking at the patients and that there is no way to do anything. This point is too unreasonable. Looking back at your national doctors, what methods do they actually do for the patients? I would like to ask, how far has the invention of specific medicines gone? I would like to ask, don't be busy! Mr. Jiao also has a wonderful passage below praising the richness of national doctors' medicines. I originally wanted to bring up his intention here, so that the readers of the country can compare the two, because I am afraid that it will disrupt the order of Mr. Jiao's original book, so I will put it aside for now and discuss it later.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(17) Typhus</p>
<p>(Q) What is typhus?</p>
<p>(A) It is an acute infectious disease with a certain fever pattern, and at the same time, red rashes appear on the skin, and mucositis also occurs in the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the Western name for typhus?</p>
<p>(A) The Latin is Typhus exanthematicus or Febris exanthematicus or Typhus petecbilis, the German is Flecktyphus or Fleckfieber, the French is Typhus exanthematicue, but the English simply call it Typhus fever or Petechial fever.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the pathogen of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) It is said to be a small body called Rickettsia prowazek, found in the intestines of lice.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the epidemic status of typhus?</p>
<p>(A) This is the most easily infected disease, more prevalent in winter; it occurs a lot in unsanitary places, such as slums, prisons, battlefields, etc. Therefore, it has other names such as famine typhus, prison typhus, or war typhus. The vector is lice.</p>
<p>(Q) Can it not recur after one infection?</p>
<p>(A) After suffering from this disease once, one can be immune for life.</p>
<p>(Q) How many days does it take to develop the disease after being infected with the virus?</p>
<p>(A) It takes one or two weeks of incubation before the disease develops.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms at the time of onset?</p>
<p>(A) It can be divided into the prodromal stage, the rash stage, and the recovery stage.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>three phases.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of the prodromal stage?</p>
<p>(A) The patient first feels a sudden chill and shivering, and then develops a fever, with the temperature about 39 to 40 degrees Celsius. There is nausea, vomiting, headache, sacral and limb pain, etc. The face is flushed, edematous or expressionless. The pulse is frequent, often leading to insomnia. On the third or fourth day of onset, the dullness boundary of the liver increases, and bronchial catarrh occurs. In addition, there are dizziness, blurred vision, flashes of light, tinnitus, nerve deafness, speech disorders, loss of consciousness, delirium, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of the rash stage?</p>
<p>(A) Four to six days after the onset of the disease, the rash is like the size of a pinhead to mung bean, round, light red rose rash. Generally, it starts from the chest and abdomen and spreads all over the body in one or two days, often reaching hundreds. The difference from typhoid fever rash is that the palms and soles of the feet also appear. And there is no recurrence. The rash is congested, but mostly turns hemorrhagic after two or three days, and does not disappear even when pressure is applied.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the state of the fever?</p>
<p>(A) The patient has a persistent high fever, which is remitting. Usually, by the second week, the fever dissipates component by component.</p>
<p>(Q) Does the patient have any other dangerous symptoms?</p>
<p>(A) Sometimes, because of weakness, neurological symptoms are very obvious. There is motor restlessness, hallucinations, fantasies, delirium, high insomnia, lethargy, etc. There may also be urinary retention or fecal incontinence.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the recovery period like?</p>
<p>(A) Two or three weeks after the onset of the disease, the recovery period begins. At that time, various symptoms disappear, and the rash fades, with bran-like desquamation. But sometimes bedsores, gangrene, lower limb neuralgia, and peripheral nerve paralysis occur.</p>
<p>(Q) How dangerous is typhus?</p>
<p>(A) It depends on the condition of the circulatory and nervous systems. It is more serious in the elderly and obese; lighter in children. The mortality rate is 20%.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there an absolute cure for this disease?</p>
<p>(A) Not yet. But injections of simple horse serum, serum from recovering patients, sterilized milk, mercury preparations, or nucleoproteins can be used; the effect is uncertain. Usually, for neurological symptoms, sedatives such as potassium bromide, Medinelevipan, etc. are used. For patients with high fever, ice packs are applied to the head, or several antipyretics are taken internally.</p>
<h3 id="e227">A Bird's-Eye View of Medicine and Pharmacy in Shanghai in the Last Ten Years (Continued) <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Shuzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Medical and Pharmaceutical Education and Publications</p>
<p>Section 1 New Medical and Pharmaceutical Education</p>
<p>In addition, Shanghai also has the private Nanyang Medical University and the private Sino-German Women's Medical School. They have been closed down one after another in the past ten years. Nanyang Medical University has several classes of graduates. The Sino-German Women's Medical School closed down shortly after its establishment. So there are no graduates. Most of its students merged into Tongde Medical College. As for those run by foreigners, there is still Harvard Medical School fifteen years ago, located on the current Haig Road. It was later closed. Most of the students studied at Harvard in the United States. These are not very relevant to this article, so I will not elaborate on them.</p>
<p>Looking at the statistics above, the first thing that makes us realize is that there are only more than 1,000 medical students in the whole of Shanghai. It takes 104 full-time teachers and as many as 62 part-time teachers. This is a very uneconomical thing and is also the result of the lack of unification of medical affairs. The second thing that shocks us is that the so-called national schools do not have completely independent affiliated hospitals. And many schools are run by foreigners. Third, although there are several private medical schools run by Chinese people, due to economic difficulties, the hospitals are not perfect. And instead, a small number of teachers lead a large number of students to practice. No one is there to assist with remote learning. If this continues, will there be corruption? Fourth, the National Shanghai Medical College, which has the fewest students, and the Women's Medical College established by the church have the most teachers. On average, the ratio is 90 and 68. Almost one teacher only teaches one and a half students. Isn't this a very thought-provoking thing? Based on the above four points, I think that medical and pharmaceutical education in Shanghai is still somewhat inconsistent with the national conditions of China and is showing a deformed state. Therefore, I associate it with "Jiao Yitang's Letter to the Nation on the Adoption of National Medicine Regulations", which criticized the Ministry of Health for spending huge amounts of money without making any achievements. Perhaps it is making one-sided observations from the deformed health administration and issuing attacks. However, to use this to obliterate science and promote Xuan medicine can be described as throwing the baby out with the bathwater and being completely confused.</p>
<p>In addition to medical and pharmaceutical schools, there are also midwifery schools, which can be said to be the most in Shanghai. There are currently eight:</p>
<p>Sino-German Obstetrics School 126 students</p>
<p>Tongde Obstetrics School 111 students</p>
<p>Dade Obstetrics School About 50 students</p>
<p>Huisheng Midwifery School About 70 students</p>
<p>Renhe Obstetrics School About 80 students</p>
<p>Cihang Midwifery School About 60 students</p>
<p>Baosheng Midwifery School The number of students is unknown at the beginning of this semester</p>
<p>Shengsheng Midwifery School The number of students is unknown at the beginning of this semester</p>
<p>There are three schools that have been closed down: 1) Dahua Obstetrics School 2) Jianhua Obstetrics School 3) Bateli Obstetrics School</p>
<p>All the above-mentioned obstetrics schools only recruit female students and train midwives to deliver babies. The length of study is only two years. The qualification for admission is only junior high school graduation. The school's equipment is stipulated by the Education Bureau and is not very troublesome. With Shanghai's talents, it is of course not difficult to find teachers for some obstetrics schools. With Shanghai's population, it is of course also easy to absorb some ordinary women as teaching materials. Therefore, in the past ten years, this kind of school has sprung up one after another like mushrooms after the rain. According to the above eight schools, an average of 300 graduates can be produced every year. This is originally a good phenomenon. And people in the society have more faith in the new method of delivery than in other medicines. Therefore, it is very optimistic to promote the new midwifery method and abolish the old midwives in a few years. It is only a pity that there are not many midwifery schools in the interior. Small counties and remote areas are lacking. And these schools are all gathered in the prosperous city of Shanghai, which has a slight drawback. Because female students from all over the country come to Shanghai and receive this kind of specialized education, their own lives are often urbanized first, and they are not very willing to return to the countryside to carry out their business. As a result, there is an oversupply of midwives in Shanghai and many of them become female nurses. The interior still feels the lack. A few years ago, I wrote an article in the North China Medical Report, discussing in detail the inappropriateness of establishing obstetrics schools in the largest cities. I didn't expect that there are more large cities now, and the interior is still unable to develop. There are many social problems and the relationship in the current situation. It is not convenient to discuss it more at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e228">The True Meaning of Pharmacy Business (3) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— People</p>
<p>Regarding the different natures of pharmacy businesses, in various European countries, they can be distinguished into two types: one is a specialized professional shop, and the other is a general trading shop. The former is referred to as a formal pharmacy in this article, and the latter as an ordinary drug store. Moreover, several countries can differentiate the business nature of pharmacies by their names. For example, in Italy, a formal pharmacy is called "Farmacia," and an ordinary drug store is called "Drogueria." Similar distinctions exist in Germany and France. Unlike our country, which collectively calls them "Dispensary," or the United States, which simply calls them "Pharmacy," Japan also has a system similar to Europe. Formal ones are called [Place Name] Pharmacy, and ordinary ones are called [Place Name] Store. The reason for distinguishing their names is to indicate the different types of business, making it easier for the government to manage, and for pharmacists to understand their responsibilities, avoiding confusion in business operations.</p>
<p>Pharmacy Business in Italy</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical system in Rome is the same as in Spain and Portugal. Formal pharmacies can sell all kinds of medicines and poisons, as well as prescriptions, and handle analysis and microscopy work. Ordinary drug stores are only allowed to sell household medicines and ordinary goods. The state enforces pharmacy laws strictly, and the number of pharmacies is also fixed. The capital city has 250 pharmacies, while there is no such limit for ordinary drug stores. Recently, the number of formal pharmacies has reached its limit, so pharmacists who want to operate in this field can only purchase existing ones from others. Ordinary drug stores are not regulated by law, but thanks to the support of the people, there are no malpractices. The effect they achieve is the same as that of formal pharmacies, except that formal pharmacies can sell all kinds of poisons and prescriptions, and handle analysis and other work. Ordinary drug stores do not have this specialized work and only sell goods, which is very different. Therefore, the boundaries between these two types of business are clear, and there is no risk of confusion.</p>
<p>As the tasks of formal pharmacies are as described above, it goes without saying that they have considerable connections with the medical community. Therefore, the harmony between the medical and pharmaceutical professions in Italy is a commendable point. Some pharmacists even set up waiting rooms for patients. Because customers come to the pharmacy to wait for a doctor's diagnosis and prescription, and then have the medicine dispensed on the spot, doctors can also use the pharmacist's laboratory for testing, which facilitates rapid diagnosis and is very convenient. In fact, a pharmacy is a clinic, or it can be called a pharmacy clinic. Therefore, doctors in Italy do not dispense medicine themselves, which means they do not encroach on other people's businesses. The harmony between medicine and pharmacy is due to professional ethics. However, medical and pharmaceutical professionals have no feelings for ordinary drug store owners, because they lack sufficient knowledge and are ultimately dismissed as outsiders.</p>
<p>Pharmacy Business in Germany</p>
<p>Formal pharmacies in Germany are called Apotheke, and they are limited. The quota depends on the region and the ratio of residents, ranging from one per 6,000 to one per 10,000. Ordinary drug stores are not allowed to sell poisons or prescriptions. The implementation of pharmacy laws is very strict. After completing the pharmacist qualification, one must undergo a two-year apprenticeship in a formal pharmacy before obtaining a license to practice in Germany, which means having the qualification to practice independently. According to German regulations, formal pharmacies are limited and cannot be opened unless through replacement or special permission. To apply for special permission, one must have all the necessary conditions and sufficient capital. Therefore, it is rare for those under the age of 50 to be granted special permission.

<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>The Harm of Seeking Perfection</p>
<p>One day, I was at home in Ningbo when I received a phone call from a friend and relative, Mr. So-and-so. He said, "There is a Mrs. Lu who is seriously ill. She has been in a major hospital for two months. It is said that her lungs are damaged, her heart is damaged, her peritoneum is damaged, and her stomach and intestines are damaged. It is so bad that there is no cure. They want to ask you to assess the situation. What do you think?" I said, "I know Mrs. Lu. She has many children. If she is suffering, I sympathize with her very much. Of course, I can go and see her. But since she has been in a major hospital, what is the diagnosis from that hospital?" He said, "Probably tuberculosis and peritonitis." I said, "What are her subjective symptoms? Does she cough? Does she have a fever?" He said, "She has a fever, but not much of a cough. It was said that she had swelling and a large abdomen, but that is better now. She has some pain when urinating, and her menstruation comes often and lasts a long time, even every two weeks. This symptom has been going on for four months." I said, "In that case, she has a gynecological problem. She should also see a gynecologist. And please have her send a urine sample for testing as a reference for the diagnosis." He said, "I will send the urine sample, and please invite a gynecologist on our behalf."</p>
<p>After we received their urine sample and tested it, there was only a trace of protein and many pus cells and epithelial cells. Based on the urine, it was entirely evidence of cystitis, nothing else. So, I and a gynecologist friend went to Mrs. Lu's residence. First, we examined her in detail within the scope of internal medicine. Her lungs, except for a slight hardening of the percussion sound at the apex of the left lung, were otherwise normal. The so-called tuberculosis was completely wrong. The slight hardening at the apex of her left lung may have been an old, past tuberculous lesion, but there was no active tuberculosis. Her heart had no murmurs, but her heartbeat was accelerated, and her pulse was accelerated (126 beats per minute), which were both symptoms of systemic weakness.</p>
<p>The question was, where did this systemic weakness come from? Examining her abdomen, the abdominal wall was soft as usual, with no swelling or ascites. When asked why there was talk of swelling, they said, "She had swelling before, and it was tense and painful when it was swollen. She couldn't even pass gas, and it made a booming sound when tapped." Ah! I understood. It turned out that the swelling was caused by the onset of cystitis and was mistaken for peritonitis. Ah! That was it. Examining her abdomen again, the liver, spleen, kidneys, etc., were normal, with no swelling. Only the lower abdomen was slightly tender, which was due to cystitis.</p>
<p>In short, the patient they claimed had damaged lungs, heart, peritoneum, and intestines was, unexpectedly, found by an unskilled person like myself to have none of those damages. However, there was evidence of heart weakness, which came from systemic weakness. I deduced that she had cachexia and suspected a uterine disease. So, I asked the gynecologist to examine her with a hysteroscope. As expected, she had uterine cancer. Then, everything was clear. I asked her if the major hospital had examined her uterus. She said they had not. Ah! That was it.</p>
<p>I thought that we had diagnosed her condition, making her confused illness clear, and that should be considered a merit. Unexpectedly, trouble arose in this clarity. It would have been fine if people had continued to say that her internal organs were all diseased. Now that I, a busybody, had found out that she had uterine cancer, I had become troublesome. The patient's family said, "What can be done about uterine cancer?" We said, "The time for treatment has been missed, and surgery is no longer possible." The patient's family said, "Then, is there any other good method?" We said, "We can try radiation with radium needles, but unfortunately, there is none in Ningbo." The patient's family said, "Is there any in Shanghai?" We said, "Of course, there is." The patient's family said, "Can we go to Shanghai for radiation?" We said, "At this stage, we cannot guarantee how effective radiation will be, but you can still go." The patient's family said, "Is there any danger on the way?" I said, "Ningbo to Shanghai is only one night's journey. I can guarantee that." Our consultation ended there. Later, they went to Shanghai. I don't know what hospital they went to, what doctor they saw, what the doctor said, or if they had radiation. I heard that she died after more than ten days! The cachexia of cancer is, of course, a deadly disease. Death is not surprising. In my opinion, Mrs. Lu's death had made the cause of her death clear, unlike most people who die in a confused state.</p>
<p>Later, I heard from many friends that everyone in the patient's family, except for her who could no longer speak, said that I was bad. First, my medical skills were bad, because the doctors in Shanghai also said that her heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys were all damaged, which was consistent with the major hospital. This showed that Chen Fangzhi was wrong. Second, my conscience was bad, saying that I knew the patient was going to die, but deliberately sent her to Shanghai to die. There were all kinds of nonsense, and I couldn't care less.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Biographical Literature <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Chinese biographical literature, since Sima Qian and up to the present, has generally been dominated by the old-fashioned style of sequential biographies. As for variations, there are tomb inscriptions, elegies, and accounts written by descendants to glorify their ancestors, so-called flattering tomb writings, which are perhaps somewhat similar. But these are always monotonous, and everyone, after death, is invariably a perfect person with complete wisdom, benevolence, and courage. I have never seen a vivid piece of writing that can portray a person's weaknesses and shortcomings. However, "Water Margin" is also called biography, and literary critics regard it as a collective biography of 108 people. "The True Story of Ah Q" also exists, and Ah Q is the most well-known one among the new literature that has been popular for more than a decade. If we regard such literature as biography, then Sun Wukong's "Journey to the West" and Dong Xiaowan's "Memories" are also biographies. The scope of biographical literature that I am talking about is definitely not that broad.</p>
<p>So, what kind of biographical literature is lacking in China? Precisely because China lacks these, even one example cannot be found. If we look for materials in foreign literature, there are indeed many immortal biographical works. A slightly older era and a style somewhat similar to "Records of the Grand Historian," but with completely different content, is Plutarch's "Parallel Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans." A more recent era, which describes the words, deeds, thoughts, personality, and surroundings of a person's life in great detail, is James Boswell's "Life of Johnson." With an elegant style, fresh writing, and indirect approaches, to narrate a person's life in a very interesting way, there is Lytton Strachey's "Queen Victoria," André Maurois' "Ariel," and Pierre Courthion's "Portraits de Seurat." In addition, there are lively biographies written by the German Emil Ludwig, the Italian Giovanni Papini, and others, which are too many to mention. Precisely because China lacks this kind of biographical writer, only self-praising autobiographies and derivative critical biographies are popular in the market. But from the fact that a great man like Sun Yat-sen is still offering rewards to solicit biographies in newspapers, it can be imagined that the biographical literature in China is declining.</p>
<h3 id="e231">On Courtliness <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Henri Barbusse, the French literary giant who is said to be coming to China but has not yet arrived, specifically stated when using the term "intellectual class" in a small book:</p>
<p>"Intellectual class丨I use this to refer to people who think, not to people who are witty, boastful, sycophantic, or exploit others spiritually."</p>
<p>"Witty people" means those who are good at being courtly. Courtliness, boasting, sycophancy, and spiritual exploitation: these four are all so-called "art of the clown." But technically, the first and fourth types are much more difficult. When used well, success is easier; when used poorly, it is also easier to run into a wall. Moreover, the status of these two types of artists is much higher than that of boasters and sycophants, because boasting and sycophancy are clearly the work of a snobbish servant. But a courtly person and a spiritual exploiter are quite like a gentleman, who is called a "guest" under the master.</p>
<p>I will now only talk about courtliness.</p>
<p>To choose a typical example from courtly people, I think it is best to choose Yang Xiu, the "child Yang Dezu" who was even admired by Mi Heng. Literary tradition says that he "had talent and learning," and "A New Account of the Tales of the World" praises his "quick wit." But in reality, his talent and learning, his quick wit, were only used as a drinking game for Cao Cao. His lifelong effort was in courtliness. When Cao Cao wrote the character "活" (live) on his "Prime Minister's Gate," he immediately ordered people to tear down the gate and rebuild it, because he knew that "the prince was just complaining that the gate was too big." When Cao Cao wrote the character "合" (together) on a box of food, he immediately ate it, because he knew that "the duke was teaching people to take a bite." In addition, there are the stories of "excellent words" and "bamboo shields," which are the most outstanding deeds in Yang Xiu's life. At that time, even Cao Cao sighed, "My talent is not as good as yours." Others, of course, "admired his eloquence," because they were not as good at being courtly.</p>
<p>However, in the last act of courtliness, he ran into a wall and lost his life. In the "chicken ribs" incident, many people called for justice for Yang Xiu. In fact, Cao Cao's idea was correct, because courtliness is only suitable for peacetime. If one interferes with courtliness in military and national affairs, it is unavoidable to cause mistakes. In this respect, Cao Cao trusted Dian Wei and Xu Chu. But Cao Cao killed Yang Xiu, so his tyranny was indeed a great mask.</p>
<p>Today, the situation of courtliness has changed greatly. First, now it is necessary to be courtly not only to individuals, but also to groups. Second, due to material convenience, those who are courtly do not have to do so in front of the master. As long as they publish some writings in newspapers and magazines, there is hope of being appreciated.</p>
<p>However, no matter what era they live in, masters are happy to have someone be courtly, but in practice, they still trust another kind of person.</p>
<p>Tracing back to ancient times, did not Lord Mengchang, who had three thousand retainers, later realize that "menial skills like crowing and stealing" were more practical?</p>
<p>From this point of view, the fortune of courtly people seems to have never been very prosperous.</p>
<p>According to my thinking, the reason for this lack of prosperity is, first, that they only know how to be courtly; second, that they want to maintain their status too much, and are not as straightforward as sycophants and boasters, thus making the master feel that their pretentiousness is unbearable.</p>
<p>There is also this story in "A New Account of the Tales of the World":</p>
<p>"Fan Xuanping was a man who liked to use intelligence and calculation, but sometimes he lost due to excessive calculation. Once, he lost his official position and lived in Dongyang. Grand Marshal Huan was in Nanzhou, so he went to seek refuge with him. Huan was trying to recruit dissidents to undermine the court, and Xuanping was also known in the capital, so Huan thought that he had come from afar to join him, and he was very happy… Although Fan was actually seeking refuge with Huan, he feared that it would damage his reputation, so he said, 'Although I have the intention of paying tribute to the court, my lost son is being treated here, so I came to visit my relatives.' Huan was disappointed, and his expectation disappeared."</p>
<p>This kind of pretense is the essence of the art of the clown. Unfortunately, Huan Wen was also a great mask (although I have never seen him on stage, I assume so), so he disdained him, causing Mr. Fan to fail.</p>
<p>Originally, the art of the clown is only for dressing up clowns as young masters.</p>

<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>If we admit that drama is a kind of public education, then we can see what kind of spiritual nourishment the Chinese people often receive. These things grab them, make them go backwards day by day, and do not let them move forward a step. However, those higher gentlemen who eat with "culture", in addition to promoting the national drama, also sent actors who played women overseas, cheated a signboard abroad, and deceived the people. They said that they used this "culture" to spiritually conquer foreign countries.</p>
<p>The pink curtain on the stage fell for the last time that night. The audience scrambled to go out. Many people crowded at the door, and the situation looked chaotic. It was more difficult to pass through that door. After a series of collisions between flesh, my two friends and I finally went downstairs, out of the theater, and stood on the embankment.</p>
<p>The time was past twelve o'clock. That friend also asked me to go to a small shop to eat something, but my tiredness made me decline. I said goodbye to them, and I walked alone on the embankment, walking through the encirclement of rickshaws, and slowly walked towards Haizhu Bridge.</p>
<p>My heart was lonely. Many melancholy thoughts surrounded me. Before my eyes was a piece of darkness, without light, without a future, and all were only some ghosts. A strong hatred burned in my heart. I cursed all the old dramas in China. I cursed all the old legacy of China. I cursed the entire Eastern culture. I asked in despair: Is there really anyone who cares about the future of the Chinese nation now? (I believe there must be) Why is no one seen coming out to severely attack the so-called Eastern culture that truly poisons the Chinese nation? (I believe there must be) Why does no one know that the deformed monsters that now fill China are all products of the so-called Eastern culture, and their thoughts and behaviors are all similar to those ghosts? (I believe there must be.)</p>
<p>"Siku Quanshu" is a treasure, the antiques of the Forbidden City are treasures, Buddhist temples are treasures, historical sites are treasures... Everything that can leave a shadow in the minds of the nation struggling on this road to the new are treasures of the ruling class! Many people believe this. However, in fact, without these things, the Chinese people can live a better life. Why should modern people know the ghost tricks of the old times? Humans do not live by history. Although history tells people not to do something, the result is that it tells people to imitate. At least half of the people visiting the Palace of Versailles want to be Louis XIV. People who visit the Forbidden City will have a strange ghost-like thought at that moment.</p>
<p>We need to forget everything and move forward on the new road with a new force. This is our only way out. However, others grab our souls with all kinds of antiques and make us forever fall into the abyss of slavery. It is not surprising that higher gentlemen promote old dramas. Now even some people who originally have nothing to do with pen and ink know to promote reading the classics. Thinking about the future of the Chinese nation in this environment, I can't help but feel grief and anger.</p>
<p>My thoughts will probably not be understood by anyone. I remember expressing the above opinion in this year's essay contest about dreams in the "Eastern Magazine". I said that the various antiques contained in the term Eastern culture block my eyes and make me unable to see the future of China. There was a period of time when I even believed that China had no future. This meaning is very clear.</p>
<p>However, many people therefore call me a pessimist. Am I really a pessimist?</p>
<p>Back at the Henan Machine Workers' Union, I breathed a sigh of relief. I am now back in the human world.</p>

<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>The woman said with her mouth, "It doesn't matter if the boat is broken," but in her heart she was thinking: "There should be a 'small boat' that is more solid and firm than this small boat, to carry this heart and sail into the vast and boundless sea of people!" She looked ahead and saw a small boat of ideals. Strong arms, a strong soul, everything has not yet been soiled by human affairs. As if smiling with satisfaction, she almost instinctively felt everything about their future.</p>
<p>She felt that she was beautiful, and she understood that in the eyes of the person in front of her, she was almost too beautiful. She understood that he had timidly and greedily noticed every part of her body. She was a little shy, but she was not afraid of him, nor was she tired of him.</p>
<p>He had no doubts about her. He was just a freshman in college, and all his interests and views, including his knowledge of women, would not leave the limitations of that grade. He did not read much, had limited understanding of life, and was slowly learning the life of a city person. He would also become a mediocre and unoriginal city person. When she first saw him, he seemed completely unworldly. After talking a few more words, she understood that all the bad things that senior high school had instilled in students, this person had also completely received his due share. But for some strange reason, this man with the atmosphere of a country person, just that bit of wildness and simplicity, made her always feel more interesting than gentlemen. He was not very smart, but the courage of a newborn calf who was not afraid of anything in the world seemed to make him great, even if it did not make him smart. It's true, this child can become great!</p>
<p>She asked him:</p>
<p>"Do you swim in the sea every day?"</p>
<p>He nodded, so she asked again:</p>
<p>"When will you leave this beach?"</p>
<p>"I don't even know myself."</p>
<p>"You should know yourself. Do what you want, don't you think so?"</p>
<p>"It's useless even if I think."</p>
<p>"Is that a child's way of speaking, or an old man's way of speaking? Children believe in their parents because they are controlled by their families, so they can say that. Old people believe in God, because they think that everything has been arranged by God, so they often don't torture their emotions too much. You…"</p>
<p>When the woman said this, she looked at the shy expression next to her, so she stopped talking. She could estimate that he was not an "old man". She smiled.</p>
<p>The man, because someone had mentioned children and old people, as if inviting him to choose for himself, had to say the following words.</p>
<p>"I came with my dad. My dad is a counselor in the XX department. Someone invited us to Laoshan, and I lived on the mountain for two days and got bored, so I ran back alone. Dad is still on the mountain writing poetry!"</p>
<p>"Your dad can write poetry?"</p>
<p>"He's a poet. He and Liang Rengong, Xia XX, have…"</p>
<p>"Ah, are you Mr. XX's son?"</p>
<p>"Do you know my dad?"</p>
<p>"I saw him once when he gave a lecture at XX. I know him, but he doesn't know me."</p>
<p>"Would you like to tell me…"</p>

<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>Lately, I often heard friends say: there is a general shining shoes on Avenue Joffre. At the time, I thought he must be another so-called "Russian" general. What's so strange about that? Because there are many petty thieves and the like on Avenue Joffre who are White Russians, aristocrats from the time of the former Tsar. If they can use a skill like shining shoes for people to make a living, they should truly be considered lucky among the upper echelons. However, I was wrong. This general's surname is Jiang, his given name is Minsheng. He is indeed a general of our great Republic of China, and one who once shed blood to resist the Japanese for the sake of national survival!</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local news section of this newspaper, there was a news story with a large headline about this shoe-shining general. According to the report: the general, a native of Harbin, was formerly under the command of Ding Chao, an anti-Japanese general in the Northeast. Having drifted to Shanghai, he was given funds by a refugee relief organization to buy shoe polish and brushes to shine shoes for pedestrians on Avenue Joffre, which was enough for him to make a living. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the relief organization and donated five yuan to help Northeast refugees, reporting on his income and expenses and expressing his gratitude.</p>
<p>For a dignified general to squat on the streets and alleys shining shoes for passersby, of course, a bunch of "masters" or so-called "ambitious" tough guys would laugh at him as being lowly and base, humming "Better to die!" But some people are also saying: If he weren't a fool and could have thrown himself into the arms of "Manchukuo," wouldn't he still be a general, second to none, awe-inspiring and full of murderous intent? Of course, some people will sigh and say: For the officers and soldiers who died in the anti-Japanese war, the state has even hired monks and Taoists to chant scriptures to give them a posthumous commendation, but those who survived and were displaced are left to their own devices with no one to care for them, with at most some minor and not widespread assistance from popular organizations! Isn't this treating the dead generously? Perhaps they are afraid that the dead will go to the underworld to file a complaint, thus enraging the King of Hell, and arresting all the enthusiastic anti-Japanese generals and soldiers, and wouldn't it be better to be polite, and instead stir up a big disaster? The most humorous and most painful tone is: Jiang Minsheng is just a character who resisted Japan for the sake of patriotism, fortunately not dying, and even more fortunately having a relief organization and being able to shine shoes for passersby so that he can continue to live, isn't that enough to be satisfied with? Compared with Liu Chongwu and others, who similarly threw grenades to warn unscrupulous merchants for the sake of patriotism and were deemed "breaking the law" and tasted the taste of iron bars, the preferential treatment, grace, and honor are truly incomparable and beyond measure!</p>
<p>However, these things don't seem to be very relevant. The fact that is placed before our faces and stimulates our eyeballs is: Jiang Minsheng is a general who shed blood to fight against imperialists for the survival of the nation-state in the Northeast Volunteer Army, and now he is drifting on this Avenue Joffre in Shanghai, a place of song, dance, revelry, and prosperity, shining shoes for passersby at the alley entrance opposite the "Cathay Theatre," the "most magnificent, majestic, and noble building on the sea"!</p>
<p>Alas, resisting Japan! Alas, officers and soldiers who resisted Japan and did not die on the battlefield!</p>
<h3 id="e236">Peace Donation <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yan</p>
<p>Everywhere you look, you can see that our compatriots love peace, such as the timely donations for the Taiping Gong Jiao (peaceful offering) and the proportional success of our previous anti-Japanese donations or aviation donations, which are good proofs of this.</p>
<p>I remember a month ago, two Boy Scouts came to my alley to solicit aviation donations. Nine out of ten of my esteemed neighbors slammed the door in their faces, and some even muttered: "Little brothers, what are you raising money to buy airplanes for, to fight the Easterners? It's none of our adults' business if China is destroyed, so why should it be the children's concern?" Hey, friends! Don't say they are cold-blooded animals, they are disgusted with war, they want to give alms on the road to peace!</p>
<p>Look! Recently, in our alley, every now and then, some "big shots" would come in to solicit donations for the timely "promoting peace," politely knocking on people's back doors in turn with a donation book in their hands.</p>
<p>"Old lady, please donate some money for the Taiping Gong, to ensure the peace of this alley throughout the four seasons," they said to an old woman who came to open the back door.</p>
<p>"Is it a donation to perform the Taiping Jiao (peaceful offering)? Good, good, I'll donate one yuan," the straightforward, peace-loving old woman replied.</p>
<p>So, one yuan, six jiao, they collected donations in turn, truly, not a single household failed to donate. Don't believe it? Just look at the yellow receipts pasted on the back doors of each house!</p>
<p>A few days later, the alley was indeed filled with lanterns and streamers, and in the evening, a group of civilized performers with brand-new electrical equipment were invited to perform the Jiao. At that time, the alley was filled with harmony and was crowded with people. The elders who mastered the Dharma and Hong skills, after distributing food to the hungry ghosts, even cooperated in singing a Jiangbei Tan Huang (local opera), truly thoughtful! They thought that the hungry ghosts in mid-July hadn't heard opera in a long time, but I saw that the number of people listening to the opera on the scene was at least ten times greater than the number of ghosts listening to the opera. Alas, is this the original intention of the elders' compassion!</p>
<p>The day after the Jiao was performed, a yellow statement of accounts was posted at the entrance of the alley, showing that more than one hundred yuan had been collected, which was used up without a single cent remaining. However, our alley comrades' belief in this account is incomparable to our belief in the accounts published in the newspapers regarding the receipt and disbursement of national salvation donations.</p>
<p>Haha! In the end, our compatriots believe in peace!</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>When I was at home, the thing I hated the most was the early morning, because my house was in a very lively alley along the road with many people, and it was the first house at the entrance of the main alley, so the sounds from the street and the alley went directly into my windows. All day long, even in the middle of the night, various noisy sounds, such as streetcar sounds, hawking sounds, and the noisy sounds of naughty children, continued non-stop, so not only was there no peace during the day, but even at night it was impossible to sleep peacefully. After midnight, at two or three o'clock, the big city was completely silent in the land of sleep, so I could steal a moment of peace and indulge in sweet dreams. But in a flash, it was before dawn. At this time, in addition to the rooster's wake-up call, there was also a sound that I was used to hearing, and it could even be said that I hated it the most, which was the group of coolies pushing wheelbarrows who came every day to break my sweet dream. The rolling sound of the wheels continued non-stop. I vaguely cursed them for being ignorant of the times! But I clung to the quilt and went back to sleep in a daze, waking up three or four hours later. But sometimes I was indeed disturbed by them so that I couldn't sleep, and I opened my eyes wide, looking at the top of the mosquito net, and thought of my four or five years of wandering life, having tasted the bitter cup of life, and I would think of this group of coolies, what were they doing getting up so early? Did they not like to sleep peacefully and come to taste the pressures of heat and cold? "Life," two big characters appeared before my eyes. We sell our brains every day to make a living, they rely on their physical strength, pushing and walking, whether it is a heavy load of ten or a hundred pounds, whether it is a long distance of ten or a hundred miles, selling two strong arms and two thick black legs. Going out at dawn and returning at dusk, working hard for more than ten hours from morning to night, every day, every month, every year, in cold, heat, wind, and rain, for the sake of a daily income of five or six mao, raising the old and caring for the young, and maintaining the life of the family. If they don't work for a day, the whole family will sit and wait to die. They do this kind of animalistic life from lively youth to white-haired old age. All their lives they have no comfortable residence, delicious nutrition, or spiritual or material well-being, and they are oppressed. They are born from suffering and die from suffering, and in the end, they return naked. However, looking back at the capitalists who are well-fed all day long, they rely on the blood and sweat of the workers to enjoy material and spiritual happiness. We are all humans, why is there such a vast difference? Thinking about it, I pitied them because of my own situation. Every day before dawn, when I hear the rolling sound of the wheels, I hope that the world will also have a day of dawn!</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act Two: A Group of Refugees</p>
<p>Madam: Oh! Are there still a few of you who haven't come?</p>
<p>Concubine: Hmph, yes.</p>
<p>Madam: There are really a lot of people outside, all of them are villagers. I don't know where they all came from.</p>
<p>Concubine: We're fleeing, and they have to flee too.</p>
<p>Madam: Oh, so they're all refugees?</p>
<p>Young Master: De Fa, come over here. (The young master and the orderly walk to the refreshment room.)</p>
<p>Madam: They're really pitiful, all with disheveled hair and dirty faces, ragged and tattered, like a group of beggars.</p>
<p>Young Master: I'm asking you, why did that fat woman run into our room? Isn't this room reserved by us?</p>
<p>Orderly: Yes, I don't know why she ran in here either. When she first came in, it seemed that someone from the railway bureau brought her in. Because the young masters were not here, I didn't dare to make a decision to force her to leave.</p>
<p>Madam: When I walked past them, the smell was really terrible, probably everyone had a lot of lice on them.</p>
<p>Young Master: Then you can tell her that this is reserved by us. Don't you dare say that? Who is she?</p>
<p>Orderly: Then please, young master, negotiate with the stationmaster.</p>
<p>Concubine: Yes, I was just thinking of going outside to take a look, but I couldn't even move my feet. The children were crying and crying, and it was simply deafening.</p>
<p>Young Master: Should I go now? Might as well wait a while.</p>
<p>Madam: It's really too hard to flee like this. But there's no way not to flee, the rumors have been really tight these past few days.</p>
<p>Maid: Madam, if the Japanese soldiers really come, only the common people will suffer.</p>
<p>Madam: Why?</p>
<p>Concubine: Didn't they flee too!</p>
<p>Maid: No, those who have fled now are probably still people who have a bowl of rice to eat. I'm afraid there are still many who can't escape. They don't even have food to eat, so where would they get the travel expenses?</p>
<p>Madam: Stop talking nonsense, what do you know?</p>
<p>(A noisy human voice, from far to near.)</p>
<p>Concubine: (Looking out the window) Oh, there are more and more people, there are no seats over there, they are all crowding over here.</p>
<p>Madam: Hey, Aunt Zhou, I'm really tired, I want to take a nap.</p>
<p>Concubine: Eldest young master, what are you standing there for? Look, they are all crowding over here.</p>
<p>Young Master: Hmph, aren't they? (Also looking out the window)</p>
<p>Concubine: What, is it just you standing there?</p>
<p>Young Master: No, De Fa is also here.</p>
<p>Concubine: Oh? Hee hee hee hee!</p>
<p>Young Master: What are you laughing at?</p>
<p>Concubine: Do you have to ask? How strange.</p>
<p>Young Master: De Fa, go to the station and make a phone call to ask why they haven't come yet. (The orderly unhappily goes out from the right door. The concubine immediately walks to the refreshment room.)</p>
<p>Concubine: How is it? Are you happy that I came?</p>
<p>(The eldest young master opens his arms and waits for her, and the concubine throws herself into her son's arms in a coquettish manner.)</p>
<p>Young Master: Good sister, are you right? We are really grateful that the Japanese soldiers are coming, otherwise, how could we be so affectionate together? This is our honeymoon trip!</p>
<p>Concubine: Hahaha, (laughs loudly, leaves her son's embrace.) You cold-blooded animal, are you willing to be a slave of a fallen country?</p>
<p>Young Master: What slave of a fallen country or not, I haven't thought about these things at all. I just want to stay with you like this, and it's fine no matter what I do.</p>
<p>Concubine: Oh, don't say such nice things, when you marry a wife, I'm afraid you won't even bother with me!</p>
