<p>時評</p>
<h3>減政運動之另　觀點　都</h3>
<p>羅掘俱窮之我國財政界。際茲救災勦匪之緊急時期。殆無在不顯示其掣襟現肘之恐慌。因是减政運動之呼聲。遂有甚囂塵上之勢。魯省府議决節縮助賑於前。蔣委長通令裁併駢支於後。最近財部於統一華北稅收之程序中。亦將以减政爲整理之入手。節無謂之耗費。謀有效之挹注。吾人對此。自樂寄以滿懷之同情。寗尙有絲毫夷猶之存念乎。</p>
<p>我國政治機闗之重疊駢出。公務人員之冗散浮列。其不合需要之程度。有遠非常人想像所及者。每一新機闗之成立。類多爲人設事。初非因地制宜。其中備員之多。尤復數倍工作。有領俸而不到任者。有到任而不治事者。沿習成由。匪伊朝夕。連鷄之勢已成。叢脞之弊莫革。試一檢覽各項官署之名義。林林總總。眞不知有多少機闗。形同虚設。其逐年支出之巨額經費。更不悉有若干部份等於浪擲。在今日局脊之情勢下。寗堪再供無謂之朘削。譬之富厚之家。畜養多士。在平時揮金如土。原不妨珠履三千。不幸家道中落。病體日。瘠疑駭雜象。環呈左右。而門下食客。顧猶欲截醫藥僅備之資。供大衆餔啜之需。爲主人者。將坐視不予制止乎。抑亦將毅然爲緊縮之處置乎。</p>
<p>或者以爲减政實行而後。以言節帑。誠爲得計。顧以向所設立之機闗。一旦遽予裁撤。向所備列之冗員。倉卒大加淘汰。在行政設施。上不將有周轉不靈調劑失宜之虞乎。則直應之曰。必必無之事也。駢支機闗。本屬贅疣性質。非實際政令所從出。冗散人員。原多尸位素餐。無行政效率之可言。舉而罷之。自無慮發生些微影響者也。從另一方面言。駢支機闗。本身雖無建樹。公文承轉。常不能不經其手。冗散人員。責任旣非專屬。文書旁午。即不免有所推諉。惟其有推諉。故公事常趨於積壓。唯其多承轉。故政令益稽其實施。汪院長所引爲痛心疾首之（公事監禁。）曷嘗非駢支冗散過多有以造成之乎。不寗唯是。此輩久置閑散常感單調豐衣飽食之餘旅進旅退之中未嘗不欲以突起之異軍。爲無聊之發展。於是挑剔公事好爲督過者有之。率意更張朝三暮四者有之。夫使此類動作。僅以無聊爲止。猶不至爲民詬病。顧其影響所。及往往福國不足。擾民有餘狙公伎倆。有使人疲於奔命者。不規其大。務爲苛細。要皆由冗員過多爲之厲階。故自消極言之。减政可無害於公家。而自積極言之。减政爲有利於民生。</p>
<p>或又以爲大批冗員裁撤而。後社會上將多一批失業之人。此言似。是而亦非確。蓋所謂冗員者。非皆不能自食其力之謂。特在某一環境中。無此需要。而</p>
<p>成爲過賸之產品耳。論資格固多優秀。論才力亦能自效。徒以歆於官中俸給之優厚。氣勢之煊赫遂欲以依附之心理。蘄不勞而坐獲。由此謬誤思想。正不知汩没若干有爲之青年。養成多少萎靡不振之惰性。宦途中多一批有閑階級。即社會上减一分生產力量。言之不滋痛歟。今能厲行减政。一方固可迫令巳染官迷者重返社會。謀實際之工作。一方亦得提醒夢想顛倒者及早回。頭絶彼企求之妄念。則其直接爲謀機闗之緊縮者。間接亦即所以策社會之健全也。</p>
<p>綜此數面以觀。則减政云者。有調節國帑之功效。可提高行政之效率。能促進民力之向上。得轉移奔競之風氣。全國政治機闗皆應諦念而力行之。可無所用其却顧矣。</p>

<h3>主席致詞</h3>
<p>由陳蝶仙·吳藴初·史久</p>
<p>芸·主席、首由陳蝶仙致</p>
<p>歡迎詞云、工業安全的工</p>
<p>作、是目前中國實業界所急需的、而這一種工作、尤其是要各種專家來指導、從前我们巳經吃過許多的虧、現在可不再吃了、因爲已經有許多富有經騐的專家、來任本會的顧問、來指示我们的途徑、所以我们今天要特别歡迎鍋爐檢騐專家梁鐘鑑先生、工程專家李又彭先生、工廠衛生專家李廷安先生、勞工專家朱懋澄先生（及建築專家薛惺仲先生、同時歡迎許多新的會員、來加入我们的隊伍、共同努力、來撲滅工廠中的災害、以達到安全的目的、又專家顧問致詞、首先由朱懋澄先生講我國工業安全的需要、和國際間如何闗心於我國的工業安全運動、在第十四次國勞大會開會時、曾經向其餘四十六國許過願心、說不久我们中國也要提倡工業安全運動、而現在居然在上海有各位熱心的實業家和領袖來組織工業安全恊會、由廠主们自動的來提倡工業安全運動、這是實業界的榮譽、也是我國在國際間的一種新的光榮、希望全國的工廠都來加入、續又講工業安全工作的進行方法、應分三面進行、第一政府應從立法司法行政來督促工廠實行安全、第二廠方應自動的起來改善設備、以减少災害、第三工人應該和廠方合作、共同負責、來消滅災害、</p>
<h3>專家演講</h3>
<p>鍋爐專家梁鍾鑑演說、大意謂工業安全工作範圍、是非常廣大、使工廠絶對安全、不是一椿很容易的事情、但是有許多極大的危險、倘使在平時注意一點、都可免除的、所以鄙人的意思、在討論工業安全的時候、不要以爲這個題目、千頭萬緒、不知從何做起、也不要事事照外國大工廠的方法、從大規模做起、反致虎頭蛇尾、没有結果、我们希望少開會、多做事、至於鍋爐的檢查方法、也主張用極簡單的方法來着手、最後希望各位、對於工業安全運動、有一種實際的工作、（二）衛生專家顧問李廷安博士演講工廠衞生和工人健康的闗係、工人健康和工廠生產、也是有極密切的闗係、我國廠主往往不顧到工人的健康、以致妨害生產、前幾年北平地毯工廠的廠主來問我、我们廠裹的童工、爲什麽不大起來　做事也没有勁、後來研究的結果、是工人缺少維他命、以致患眼疾、後來設法改良、二星期後大見功効、到現在已經没有這種現象、近來</p>
<p>病一二小時、有時又請幾位護士、當時我問他们所做的工作、祇是做幾種治標的看病工作、而對於根本的預防工作、毫不注意、這是大錯誤、我们提倡工廠衛生、乃是要做根本的工作、這種根本工作、就是設法預防、和注意工人的營養、至於工廠衛生的進行工作、希望政府與貴會合作、將來共同組織委員會、商議一切應辦工作、</p>

<h3>江浙漁業管理局調查　沿海漁民風災損失</h3>
<p>呈實業部添建護洋艦七艘　改進捕魚工具爲當務之急</p>
<p>月來海上颶風、迭襲江浙洋面、以致沿海一帶、不論農家漁户、均遭重大損失、中央社記者、特以此事往訪江浙區漁業管理局局長袁家驥、茲蒙見告如下、</p>
<h3>調查漁民風災損失</h3>
<p>據云、本月曾有兩次颶風、過江浙洋面、雖事前有天文臺發出警告、但漁民散處各地、一時頗難週知、故有不及防範者、或遭覆舟没頂之禍、或遭家破人亡之災、實爲年來所僅見、本局得此消息、即經派員往各方調查、惟以範圍較廣、一時尙無詳細報告到局、預計此次損失、當不下數十萬之鉅、本局現已電請實業部、指示救濟辦法、</p>
<h3>呈部添建護洋新艦</h3>
<p>記者復詢以邇年來漁村衰落、漁民痛苦異常、政府將如何救濟、據袁氏云、漁民痛苦、是屬實情、究其原因、良以缺乏保障、按江浙洋面水產本甚豐富、惟日人往往侵入洋面、偷捕漁類、苟有强力之護洋艦、梭巡其間、則日人不敢侵漁、而我國漁民、得以安心捕捉、尙有漁民捕得之魚、運送内地、往往受人勒索、政府苟能予以保護、俾得安全運往内地、則漁民必可減少痛苦、本局現雖有護洋艦六艘、但以洋面遼闊、不敷應用、業巳呈准實業部、另添新艦七艘約於明年初可以應用、則漁民必可受惠不少、</p>
<h3>漁業建費决定徵收</h3>
<p>袁氏復云、本局所定漁業建設費一層、實以體察漁民痛苦、減輕漁民負担、爲要旨、蓋過去政府對於徵收漁稅、名目繁多、漁民負担極苦、今規定徵收漁業建設費、其稅率旣低、且規定爲改良漁業之用、故於漁民莫不樂從、本局現旣决定徵收、惟望不論漁民漁商、均應明瞭此意、使政府爲民謀福利之計劃、勿受絲毫之障碍、</p>
<h3>漁業統制暫難實現</h3>
<p>記者以　有人提議實行漁業統制、詢以是否可行、據云、此事一時决難實現、一以政府經費支絀、又以中國漁業尙在幼稚時期、爲今之計、當以保護漁民爲首要、且由政府創設漁輪若干、置備新式捕漁工具、使漁民知所仿效、逐漸改進、實爲當務之急云、</p>

<h3>羅文玄演講各國經濟之動向</h3>
<p>八仙橋青年會、昨晚特聘中山文化院羅文玄先生演講（倫敦會議後各國經濟之動向）、由炳勛速記社金綬速記、聽衆非常踴躍茲將其演詞摘錄於後、略謂、欲知倫敦會議後各國經濟之動向、必先明瞭世界經濟會議前後之種種情形如何、爲何要開經濟會議、自一九二九年號稱黄金國之美國、首先發生股票恐慌、此後世界經濟恐慌、也日漸暴露、美國失業人數統計約一千二百萬、中國雖無統計、但至少在三千萬以上、日本有四十多萬、但實際上不下二百萬、各資本主義國家想盡了許多方法、都没有成效、如增加闗稅、限制外貨進口、結果、整個世界、都感受貨物凝滯的恐慌、因此大家約定在今年開世界經濟會議、參加者共有六十三國之多、惜各國皆抱自私自利觀念、金本位國與非金本位國形成二集團、雙方對恃不能調和、在會議中貨幣問題、自始至終、總不能得解决方法、美國先提出戰債問題、以爲戰債不解决、經濟會議更不能解决、因此會議發生重大的障碍、一九二九年以來、各國存貨太多、大半由於物價跌落之故、總之、這次會議、可以說毫無結果、卽使繼續開會、恐也祗有失敗而己、但會議後到底動向如何、美國現已用一種經濟革命主義、極力補救資本主義之窮途、又所謂通貨膨脹政策、使物價得以提高、增加工資、减短工作時間等、以打開一個新局面、又如英國在印度·坎拿大·等殖民地、極力提高闗稅、抵制外貨、組織　種經濟勢力、此外日本將貨物全部搬到中國來、其實貨物還是不能儘景銷售、他積極擴充海陸軍、用海陸軍之力、維持他貨物的市塲、在目下資本主義將死的時期、美日·英美·英日·間已有明顯的衝突、現在從各方面觀察起來、我们得到一個結論、世界經濟會議的失敗、是各帝國主義分贓不均的結果、所以將來在資本主義之下、祇有戰爭、可以解决恐慌、以砲火爲唯一的辦法、</p>
<h3>鄭通和講士布運動與挽救國難</h3>
<p>昨在土布運動大會</p>
<p>本市土布運動大會、昨請行政院秘書長褚民誼、及江蘇省立上海中學校長鄭通和、兩氏講演、褚氏因奉行政院電召赴京、臨時中止、由鄭通和氏以實行着土布之敎育家、講極沉痛之經濟挽救國難問題、全場聽衆、深受感動、茲記其演詞大略如下、</p>
<h3>國家危機益迫</h3>
<p>鄭氏略謂、我國家至此危機日迫之時、民衆痛苦、實比亡國之民更甚、全國上下、當力圖挽救、挽救之道、首在經濟不受侵略、欲經濟不受侵略、惟有提倡士貨、拒絶洋貨、從國勢講、我國已失土地如東北四省、誰能担保收回、卽未失者、如西藏·蒙古·新疆·諸省、何一不在危機四迫之中、文化落後、經濟破產、農村没落、民衆困苦、最近黄河水災、死亡流離、危及國脈、究何因致此、竊以爲有二大原因、（一）受帝國主義之經濟侵略、（二）國民自己墮落不爭氣之結果、我國在百年前、男耕女織、衣食無愁、自給自足、不求於人、農民經濟狀况、頗爲優裕、而國家亦因以無事、自海外交通、鴉片戰爭發生以來、外國貨如潮湧而進、國人爭購外貨、吐棄國產、家庭手工業停頓、因此金錢源源輸出、而經濟根本破產、</p>
<h3>入口出口統計</h3>
<p>在最近六十四年之中、入口爲二五四·八七二·七六七·二○○元、概括說是兩千五百萬萬、出口僅一九四·二○○·○○○·○○○元、相差之數、是六百萬萬元、四萬萬人每一人要攤一百五十元、往年每家五人、男耕女織、相安無事者、今一旦可無所生產、則平均此五人之家庭、約加八百元之担負、如此經濟、焉得不破產、反之、如不受外人之經濟侵略、則每人年可得八百元、兩兩相比、令人寒心、據海闗貿易報告、十九年入超是四五○·○○○·○○○闗兩、二十年入超是五一○·○○○·○○○闗兩、二十一年入超是五六○·○○○·○○○闗兩、一年中損失三十二萬萬元、國家究有多少財力、能經得起如此損失、故卽就經濟一項而言、已足以亡國而有餘、現在中國農村已不堪言狀矣、宜興鄉下無飯吃之農民、吃土與樹皮、皖北去年大雪時、有一百五十家人口同時餓死、今年米如此便宜、而農民無錢去買、因窮苦之鄉民、雖欲借數隻銅元亦不可得、皖鄂贛各地無法生活之農民、均逃亡在外、竟有流爲土匪、</p>
<h3>生活如何安定</h3>
<p>推厥成因、實惟經濟不能獨立、外貨暢消、國產衰落之故、今後救國之惟一要務、卽在安定人民之生活、欲使人民生活安定、必人民自身先能抵制外貨、購買國產始、國產之首要、卽爲土布、於此吾人對於同胞有二大希望、（一）大家不要口頭談、要人人實行穿土布、（二）土布工商業要趕快設法改良、使實實在在能價廉物美、今日吾人欲恢復中國經濟、使子孫不做亡國奴、惟有自挽救農村經濟破產始、欲挽救農村經濟破產、惟有自人人肯着土布始、</p>

<h3>睡</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>縱的方面，（睡）與中國，已有很悠久的歷史。古代的聖君明主，在未出世之前，母后必先有一個甚麽投懷的異夢，就可證明國家的隆替，繫於母后所睡的那一覺非淺。卽以民間而說，（睡）也很佔地位。諸葛亮草堂午睡，給說書先生，譜上氷絃，嗡着鼻子邊彈邊唱，何等精彩，儘會說得聽衆，呵欠連連。（十年一覺揚州夢），直到現在，還是一句絶妙好辭，妙就妙在會睡上面。更其膾炙人口的睡史！當推（陳搏一　睡千年。）彭祖活了八百歳，陳搏一覺醒來，還說彭祖短壽。</p>
<p>横的方面，（睡）與中國人，也有特殊的闗係。在火車中，除了說話，抽烟者之外，所見的第三種人，便是依着火車的震動，而摇摇擺擺打　睡的了。雖然在一段極短的旅程中，也儘有把頭撞到鄰座者的肩頭上，或是東西給人偷去了也不知道的。假使讀者有興，一清早到馬路上去瞧，定也可以瞧到幾個下半身坐在人力車裹，而連頭帶肩横在車身外睡着了的坐車者。大學生，中學生，在課室裹瞌睡，辦公人員，脚擱在寫字檯上打中覺，是日常的功課。至於茶樓浴室中，鼾聲繞樑，更不用詫爲奇觀，就是在理髮肆中，打盹得理髮師無法刮鬍子的，也是並非創舉。失地辱國，雪恥不忘睡覺，所以還要（臥薪一。强宼打進來了，都說滅此朝食，但是說到後來，忽來一句（枕戈待命）。可知　是（性命交闗）的當兒，還未能，忘情於睡一。所以（睡）與中國闗係之深，可稱（獨步全球），夠得（稱雄世界）。（睡猪），不能說是毫無來歷。近來聽說美國（睡病猖獗，衞生當局，大起恐慌。不知被這種睡病）所沾染的病人，是否合咱中國人的好睡差不多。若是這話猜得没有錯，那麽，（中美邦交素睳），倒正好拜把子。</p>
<h3>聰明人與音樂家</h3>
<p>— 胡文</p>
<p>聰明人不是天生成的，所謂（將相本無種），有的是從師學來的，有的是從朋友處傳染過來的，也有的從自己做人經騐得來的。要學做一個聰明人，說難不難，說容易也不容易，雖然不必一定要去尋師訪友，但至少也得知道三個秘訣。</p>
<p>那三個秘訣呢？就是（吹），（拉），（彈）。第一自然要會（吹），（吹）的範圍，是没有限制的；看對方是什麽樣的人，就該怎樣吹，例如鄉間一個故知舊友到你這兒來，你就可以對他說：（ＸＸ要人是我的朋友，ＸＸ大亨是我的拜把子弟兄！）倘那朋友是個土財主的話，他一定要來奉承你一點兒見面錢，或者孝敬你一些禮物，這不是（吹）的便宜嗎　　（吹）是對平輩或小輩朋友隊裹用的，倘對比你上一級或者你時常有事情找他的人，那就只好實行（拉）的政策了。（拉）的效用，可就比（吹）的大呢！假使有小洋貨店裹西施或是自己朋友家裹的姊妹，被大人们看中了，想要討來做小老婆，你使要趕快（拉），一旦（拉）成功了，眞個其福無窮。</p>
<p>倘然没有有（拉）的本領，或者（拉）這種好善事輪不到你頭上來，那就非具有（彈）的條件不可了。怎麽呌（彈）？就是面皮須有彈簧那般厚，可以軟硬自如，對大人就要立刻軟下來，大拍馬屁，對鄉下阿木林，便要鼓起厚堆堆的面孔對着他，能如此，也不失爲一個聰明的人</p>
<p>學做聰明的訣門多着呢，這三件不過是總節目罷了；還有各種各式的秘訣，</p>
<p>且讓想做聰明人的人細心去研究，這裹不多說了。</p>
<p>由聰明人我就想起了中國音樂家，音樂家的擅長，也就是（吹），（洞簫笛笙）（拉），（京胡二胡）（彈），（三絃琵琶）雖然使用時的手法不同，而其（換麵包主義）則一也。我想世界上决没有比他们還要相同的人了</p>
<h3>在丈夫跟前</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>在丈夫跟前，你切不可說某家生活如何舒服，如何幸福，因爲這樣，要剌痛你丈夫的心。　　在丈夫跟前，你切不可說某個男子如何康健，如何漂亮，因爲這樣，能使你的丈夫，引起不正當的懷疑。</p>
<p>在丈夫跟前，你切不可常常要求買這樣那樣，如果你的丈夫在經濟拮据的時候，因爲這樣，能使你的丈夫，精神亦感覺到極大的不快。</p>
<p>在丈夫跟前，你要時常玩弄你的天眞爛漫而清潔的小天使，因爲這樣，能增進作丈夫的快樂，間接亦卽增進夫婦的愛情。</p>
<p>在丈夫跟前，不要時常報告家庭經濟拮据的情形，因爲這樣，要引起你丈夫極大的悲哀。</p>
<p>在丈夫跟前……</p>
<h3>談啞</h3>
<p>— 魯鈍</p>
<p>啞，許多人把牠列在跛瞽一類殘廢之羣中，我趕得是不平等的。啞吧子的嘴，和普通人在不曾有什麽構造上的差異。只不過少了說話的技能罷了。但，嘴吧的技能，决不是僅僅說話一種，牠還具着吃飯和接吻的功能。啞吧可以吃西菜中餐，也可以喝湯飲酒，同樣可以辨别鹹淡甜酸。至於接吻。哑吧的嘴原是完好的，旣與飲食無妨，接吻更没有什麽不便？况據生理學家研究，接吻是香，味，觸覺三種作用，那啞吧還是可以照舊吻他的情人。</p>
<p>講到（說話），俗語有二句勸人少說話的句子：（病從口入，禍從口出）。况且在這個年頭兒說話是不容易的。旣然長輩敎訓我们（多一事不如少一事）的處世秘訣，那我们就得少說話，最好是裝啞。古書云：（明哲保身）。這更是要你少說話的明證。有嘴能說話的人還得裝聾作啞，那你還不如直捷做了啞吧好　　（飲食男女，人之大欲也）。這是古訓。啞吧旣能飲食，就與做人之道無虧，何必定要說話？况（猩猩能言，不離獸類，鸚鵡能言，不離飛鳥。）可憐畜生辛辛苦苦學會了幾句說話，還要被人奚落：旣成啞吧，又何必定要學裝手勢想說話？是不是爲了監察院的委員李夢庚，提議中央組織（納言委員會）而預備大發其言呢？這啞謎請啞朋友來猜吧？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十五回　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>他也不敢再向下說，正有别個人進門，他向前自張羅買賣去了。積之坐着喝酒，眼睛只管望了那片麥地。記得離開海甸的時候，遠山近田都蓋着積雪，現在回來，却換了一個樣子，滿眼都是綠色了。人也是這樣，去的時候，楊家老姑娘，還是一位姑娘，於今回來，也許已經是趙連長太太了。趙連長介紹我到大紅門去敎書，我爲他是見義勇爲，帮我一個大忙，於今看起來，他用的是調虎離山之計罷了。我爲人眞太老實了，怎麽自己不仔細想一想呢，一個素不相識的人，突然的來拜訪，突然的又和自己作事，他到底貪圖着什麽？若不爲着什麽，在軍隊裹作事的人，身體很不自由的，時間是很受着限制的，他何必由城外跑到城裹去拜會我呢？事後一想，這件事一些没有疑問，自己是中了人家的計。旣然是中了人家的計，還去感謝人家作什麽，那不是徒惹着人家笑話嗎？他眼望着田野，心裹不住的出神，手中端了杯子，只管一杯又一杯的，向口裹送了酒去喝。喝完了四兩酒，繼續地向店伙又要了四兩酒來喝。把兩碟子都吃光了，看看門外邊那柳樹的濃陰，巳經縮着了一團，那分明是太陽當了頂，時候巳經近午，再要排徊，恐怕回家就晚了，於是手扶了桌子，身子幌了兩幌，站起身來。不料當他這樣起身時、却有一種意外的會遇，逼得他又把頭低了下去，（一九六）</p>
<h3>病美人</h3>
<p>— 俞人美</p>
<p>侍兒扶起嬌無力，始是新承恩澤時。）我们環肥的貴妃娘娘不可算是一個病美人，然而以古代文學家的眼光看來，一定要把伊描寫得弱不勝依的模樣，纔算得是一個被君王寵愛的美人兒　　紅樓夢裹的林黛玉，是一個十足的病美人，無故尋愁覓恨，每日裹以涙洗面；當他念着花謝花飛的葬花詞的時候，不知揮了多少斷腸涙，這樣的一個多憂善病的染有肺癆象徵的病熊少女，令人看了惹氣，却徧徧在文學家的筆墨下，是一個古代的東方標準美人。</p>
<p>好好的一雙天足，硬生生地把它糖得不盈一握：天生的胸脯偏偏要把緊身馬夾，直裹得比包袱還硬。一陣輕風吹　就要摇曳着站立不定，非得喚個伏侍丫頭，扶着走出閨門不可，這樣纔顯得是個傾國傾城的天下第一美人兒。</p>
<p>這種病態的女子，不用說，壓根兒就生不出身材魁梧的偉男子來，所以歷代執國家大權的宰輔大臣，都是手無搏雞之力的白面書生，呌他们做出些什麽事業來？</p>
<p>直到如今，我们榮膺（東亞病夫）的一個銜頭，决非僥倖獲來的，這也許是我國數千年來　力研究病態哲學的成功吧</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>應時水果的藥效</h3>
<p>水果中的桃·梨·橘·甜瓜等，爲夏季時應時的食品，而爲人人最愛啖的，這幾種水果，對於我们身體，很有　騐的益處，現在我把重要的寫出來。</p>
<h3>梨</h3>
<p>梨不但有助胃的消化作用，而且有中和食物中毒的功效，因爲梨含有多量的水分，可以退熱，若患輕熱的肺病者，常食鮮梨，可以减輕病勢，小孩患百日咳，或患感冒咳嗽，把生梨一個，加上蘿蔔兩片，紅糖或冰糖少許，煎熟，紋汁飤之，收效奇大，又中風，噤口的人，灌以梨汁，尤有靈騐。</p>
<h3>葡萄</h3>
<p>葡萄爲心臓病的主要營養劑，亦爲腎臓病，肝臓病，泌尿器病，肥胖病，便秘症等調和藥，若是没有鮮葡萄時，多吃葡萄乾亦好，但是患脚氣病胃酸過多症，胃潰腸，盲痬炎，急性腹膜炎等的人，絶對　食。</p>
<h3>橘</h3>
<p>橘爲治療脚氣病的惟一良品，不論重輕症與時期遠近，都很有效，若一日三回，於食後食一個，尤爲適宜，假使橘味過酸，可加些白糖，用刀切片泡茶，又可爲腸出血病的預防。</p>
<h3>桃</h3>
<p>桃葉煎水洗浴，比任何藥水肥皂爲好，絞葉的汁，用以擦皮膚，可除皮膚睡塊，又桃仁有通大使之功，常常要便秘前人，多吃桃仁，非常適宜，而且可以解馬克羅中毒，婦女月經不調，亦有靈效，又用桃葉汁擦面，皮膚可以漸漸姣嫩。</p>
<h3>甜瓜</h3>
<p>甜瓜中富有維他命Ａ，就是含有强壯身體的要素，外國人有一夏天的甜瓜，可比冬天的橘子）一句話，大凡缺乏維他命Ａ而患貧血病的人，在夏天選食各種甜瓜極爲適宜，而且甜瓜香氣，可使食慾亢進的。</p>
<h3>吃香蕉的常識</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>香蕉是熟帶地方的植物，繁殖力非常快速，普通以十個月至十二三個月就會生長得很大。不過是一年的植物，所以等到香蕉採下後。其樹就要枯死了。老樹倒地後，又能在樹幹邊上發生新芽，這新芽逐漸長大，以爲栽種的樹苗。所以在熱帶地方，四季常夏，輪流不絶的可以栽培的。而且因爲熱帶地方太陽的强烈，有高至四五米突的大樹。說到我们所吃的實，從科學上而言，並非是實，甘甜的部分，爲香蕉的内皮，而隨手剥去捨棄的青皮，爲香蕉的外皮，所以普通人以爲所吃的，是肉，這是錯誤了。香蕉從出產地採下，送到内地的，都是青而未熟的，如在冬天，要其早熟，可用火烘，在夏天，可以放在氷室中，使由氷溶化的水，滴在香蕉上，保持華氏七八十度的温度，那末，夏天過了四五日，冬天過了七八日，就漸漸的變爲黄色而熟了。香蕉内含有很多的營養分，尤其是因爲含有維他命Ｃ，所以能夠防除貧血病。當歐洲大戰的時候：德國有一信士官，名呌洛克那，他與兵士乘了帆船爲大風所害，漂泊到海中，一直把船吹到南太平洋，因爲長久没有吃到青菜類的食物，他们都患貧血病，舌焦，唇赤齒落，幾瀕於死，後來漂到一個小島，看見香蕉，都爭食以爲充飢，其後不到三天，各人的元氣，就完全恢復了。</p>

<p>成績三米七八五在十項運動中造成　十項第一陳陵五二二九·七五五分</p>
<p>十項運動之前半部、業於星期五比賽竣事、昨尙餘後半部、日前之趨勢、陳陵居首、其後之名次爲蕭鼎華、吳鐘瑶、符保盧、曹裕、劉希文等、昨日競賽之結果、形勢較日前大爲逆轉、符保盧由第四升至第二、劉希文由第六位升至第三位、曹裕由第五位升至第四位、蕭吳則落居第五六位、十項後半部之高欄、陳陵之成績最佳、惜陳於鐵餅標槍兩項、不甚得手、以是未能超出全國紀錄、昨日十項中之最精彩者、厥爲符保盧之撑竿跳、是項比賽中、曹裕與劉希文先後躍過三米二七、陳陵繼之躍過三米三九五、其後符保盧乃個人獨跳、先跳過三米六六、再升至三米七八五、亦從容跳過、查此高度、已超出其本人所保持之全國紀錄、十項運動撑竿跳之有此成績者、不可多得、只此一項、卽獲九百餘分、已與十項撑竿跳之千分世界紀錄接近、聞符君之有此成績、源於其常年練習不輟、符君自到滬以來、卽供　　海勤奮書局、任該局體育編輯部文牘、因該局洽對全國體育恊進會運動塲、故於公餘練習判别動奮、符之投擲、亦頗擅長、於擲鐵餅一項、輕輕一試卽得三一米五十之紀錄、惟於千五百米一項、符君因習跳躍、不欲勉强從事、以防有碍肌肉、故乃平平完塲、統計總分、位列次席、第三名劉希文、在前五項中不甚得手、後五項中分數極爲平均、第四名曹裕、爲滬上十項老將曾滬上次全運冠軍、因疎於練習、故乃屆居第四、蕭鼎華與吳鐘瑶、因敗於撑竿跳、遂致落選、</p>

<h3>曁南得足球錦標　東華棄權</h3>
<p>足球得　賽權者、爲東華對曁南、原定昨日决賽、因東華要求展期、致未克舉行、據東華要求展期之理由、謂爲大會報名註册、祇限十五人、但現有六人受傷、不克出場、是以不能成軍、故要求改期比賽云云、但大會方面、認爲要求改期、格於會章、未便允許、東華不得已自願棄權、足球錦標、應歸曁南、於是一場精彩足球大戰、無形消滅、未免令人失望、</p>
<h3>務本得　女子排球錦標</h3>
<p>海星郭筱萍不違業餘規則</p>
<p>女排球决賽（務本對海星）、在抗議中舉行、詳情已誌前報　前因民立女中排球隊、提出海星隊員郭筱萍資格問題之抗議、經大會派員調查、復經大會審判委員决議、郭筱萍現任廣肇小學一年級級任、擔任國語算術等科、（並非敎學體育功課）且爲期已一年有餘、對於業餘運動員資格、立無抵觸之處、祇缺辦理恢復業餘資格之手續、故女子排球錦標、應歸務本、</p>

<h3>滬江得男子籃球錦標　兩江得女籃球錦標</h3>
<p>滬江勝曁南四七比三四後來居上</p>
<p>兩江勝東南二五比二一勝來不易</p>
<p>全市運動會男女籃球昨晚大出意外、幾乎打破紀錄而創新局面、滬江雖以四十七比三十四勝曁南、得男子錦標、但滬江在上半時一直服於曁南之下、兩江勝東南、二十五比二十一得女子錦標、其形勢之接近、競爭之劇烈、得未曾見、最後一節、才决勝負、東南中興、希望無窮也、茲記兩組戰况如下、</p>
<h3>緊張驚險　兩江勝東南</h3>
<p>兩江東南之戰局、幾乎分分秒秒在緊張驚險之中、自開場以至將了、雙方皆相距不離二三分、分數平等者又四五次、且於第二局中、東南曾以十六比十四超出、事前一面倒兩江得勝之預測、完全失敗、要非東南於最後之一節、失於慌亂、局面或將大變、經騐不足、不能言病、後起新軍、成績如此、已值得贊美矣、</p>
<h3>東南猛進</h3>
<p>兩江球藝依然如此、難言其特殊進此、後衛已大見减色、最可注意者爲東南球藝之突飛猛進、前鋒活動力之每速聯絡之純熟、大受全塲贊賞、球一入兩江區域、卽有進球之危險、潘月英沙場、無庸介紹、中鋒廖祝元敏速活潑、得未曾有、身材稍高、中鋒最適、孫琤亦能稱職、射籃則廖孫俱差、後衞亦軟弱、出球殊費氣力、以實力言、兩隊相去無幾、兩江憑其經騐剛强耳</p>
<h3>難解難分</h3>
<p>楊森先開紀錄、頓時廖祝元亦回敬之、陳榮明潘月英互顯身手、東南以四比三·六比五兩次佔先、雙方之競爭益見劇烈、東南籃下連失機會二次、兩江卒以楊森陳榮明之以兩球、九比六居前於第一節、第二節中、東南大顯顔色、潘月英藉石瑞霞之犯規、擲中又加一分、十二比十二、潘月英再加一球、東南超出、陳榮明以十六比十六平等上半時、</p>
<h3>最後之勝</h3>
<p>下半時楊森雖罰中又佔先一分、然孫琤亦罰中、十七比十七、兩江後衛石瑞霞亦於此時以三次侵人罰出、大現動摇、惜因東南之疎漏、第三節兩江以二十一比十九佔前二分、最後决勝負之一節、雙方皆陷於慌忙驚亂之中、鎭定者得勝、陳榮明罰中、加上一分　廖祝元遠射中的、東南又僅落後一分耳、再中卽可獲勝、此時球在兩江陣地盤旋甚久、惜乎東南慌張不定、兩江遂以二十五比二十一最後勝利、裁判舒鴻陸翔千、</p>

<h3>滬江克曁南　曁南聲勢</h3>
<p>滬江曁南之戰、上半時之局面觀之、大有產生驚人結果之可能、曁南先以七比零居上、聲威煊赫、於是一路居先直至上半時、將畢前之二分鐘、滬江奮鬥成十九比十九、馮念華錢敬鏞各建奇功、二十一比十九反敗爲勝、上半時如此終结、曁南在上半時中之表演、亦殊流利熨貼之至、進步之速、出乎意外、迨後成十三比七、曁南佔先六分、滬江見勢不佳、陸鍾恩乃入替孫寶慶、於是步步進逼、愈走愈近局面乃告轉變、　　十項運動冠軍陳陵（葉長烈攝）</p>
<h3>滬江後起</h3>
<p>下半時之開塲曁南尹貴仁、一中再中、又打成各二十五之平勢、方以爲曁南將又振作有爲、不料從此一蹶不振、滬江一連得中十五分之多、成四十比二十五、於是勝負之形勢、遂成穏定、曁南王南珍後衛大柱、腹部受傷、不無影響、後以葉培初代替、實力大差、四十三比二十八時、忽發生不幸之誤會、雙方大將黄兆霖馮念華均由裁判員命令離塲、此後之形勢、遂人於缓和、滬江亦採取保守政策、以四十七比三十四完塲、裁判員舒鴻李祖祺、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>洋和貓</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>大凡學習法文的人，到了讀選文的時候，總要讀到一篇東西：都德（Ａ.Daud</p>
<p>et）的（塞根先生的山羊）（Ｌe　Chevre　de　monsieu　Seguin）。　　這是說塞根先生先後養了許多山羊，但那些山羊先後地逃走了。原因是，牠们不堪繩子和栅門的覊勒錮閉，而憧憬於後山的生活。那里，雖然有狼，但是可以隨意地跳，隨意地跑，隨意地打滾；狼來的時候，則可以用了兩隻角去對付。而這里，園子雖然整潔，草兒雖然鮮嫩，主人雖然愛護備至，但繩子和栅門到底太難堪了，所以一有機會，牠们都掙脫了繩子，溜出了栅門，跑到後山去，過了一天新生活之後，晚上遇着狼，就戰到力盡，然後倒斃，死而無悔。　　這樣，塞根先生從不曾養牢過一隻山羊。即使把繩子放長，把先前的山羊遇狼的故事引以爲誡，但他的山羊總是一隻一隻地逃了去。</p>
<p>和這故事相反的是左拉（Ｚola）的（貓的天堂）（Ｌe　Paradis　des　Chats）。　　那是說一個太太所養的一隻貓，也因爲厭倦了温暖，舒適的牢獄似的生活，逃出外面，與羣貓爲伍，想過自由的生活。可是過不到一天，牠就恐慌起來了，牠看到所謂自由的生活，是淋雨，挨餓，奔波，逃避……牠要求一隻雌貓送牠回到了老家，牠留她一同過牠所過的生活，但她不屑地走了。女主人因爲牠曾逃走，把牠打了一頓，接着就拿肉給牠吃，所以牠下結論說：（挨打而有肉吃的地方，就是我们貓的天堂）。</p>
<p>都德和左拉，都是法國的大作家，他们都有别的偉大的作品在。上面所舉的，不過是小品而已，但即是小品，也何等可愛。先前分别地讀過，也曾感動，今天一起想了起來，覺得他们不謀而合地寫出這樣的作品來，其中一定含着並非偶然的社會的意義。</p>
<h3>悲哀的販賣者</h3>
<p>— 馬國亮</p>
<p>理髮師替我把頭髮修剪着，我自己正入神地看着最近出版的一本書。偶然把頭抬起來，從面前的大鏡子看過去，反映着半扇開着的正門外面，有一個憔悴的人，右手捧着他頸上生出來和他自己的頭差不多大小的肉瘤，面上現出痛苦的颜色，口裹低聲說着使人悲憫的話。　　理髮師把我的頭推向左邊，替我剃右臉的汗毛，然後我彷彿聽到銅板鏗鏘的聲音，當我再把臉朝過來時，門外的捧肉瘤者巳經不見了。我想那個悲哀的販賣者一定已經得到了顧客了。</p>
<p>是的，我說悲哀的販賣者，這是不錯的。因爲他们什麽都没有了，或是什麽都賣不去了，賸下的祇有悲哀，他们祇好拿悲哀去呌賣。有的捧着他的肉瘤，有的顫抖着一隻生滿了濃瘡的脚，有的用悽楚的言辭，有的用眼涙，但販賣悲哀，是一樣的。</p>
<p>悲哀便是他们僅有的，靠着牠们乞到别人的憐憫的貨色。</p>
<p>社會裹一天到晚進行着許多各式各樣的買賣，但是悲哀的販賣，無疑地，是最不值錢的。有人販賣權勢，像你付給若干錢便可以給你一個相當價值的職位或榨取的力量等。權勢是支配物質的力，而物質又是做成或加增權勢的原素；所以，爲增大這力量，一方面又必須有人去用賤價把别人的血汗買來，再用高價賣出，從中獲得利潤來鞏固自己的力量。這一種買賣便成爲現代許多人勾心鬥角地競爭的中心。在我们日常的一根綫，一塊毛巾，都有這種買賣的氣息存在。</p>
<p>這樣，旣有人要收買别人的血汗，那末自然有人要出賣出自己的血汗了。在農村，在城市，就滿佈了販賣血汗的人。　　但是不合理的買賣，結果陷進了窘境是必然的。於是連那些想忍痛以賤價出賣自己的血汗的人也被拒絶了。血汗不能販賣，有的便販賣了自己的妻女，有的販賣了自己的田地，有的甚至販賣了僅有的鐮刀。</p>
<p>一切都没有了。血汗依然無處販賣。於是現在，每一條馬路邊，每一個城市裹，都滿充了販賣悲哀的人。他们的招牌，有的是大肉瘤，有的是顫抖的瘡脚。有的是悽楚的言辭，有的是眼涙。　　悲哀的唯一顧客是慈善者。但是眞正的慈善者是没有力量的，而有力量的人们剛又是慈善者的對頭。所以悲哀無處可賣的時候恐怕也快臨到了。</p>
<h3>秋夢記</h3>
<p>— 埜容</p>
<p>晚餐以後，捧着一本書到床上去看，不料竟睡覺了。於是作了一個夢。</p>
<p>夢見我不知作了一篇什麽文章，竟至犯罪，逃了兩三轉，終逃不脫，被抓去明正典刑。那刑法奇怪得很，像是腰斬之類，腰股以上，均被斬去，但又剩下兩隻手；身體頭面，都不知去向，手腿四肢却依舊相聯，而且還能走，還能寫字。</p>
<p>失了腦袋和身體，但似乎還能感覺，抱了滿腔寃憤，到各處去呼寃求助。碰見人，都不能看見我，就好像没有我存在一樣，而我却呌不出聲來，因爲已經失了口舌。</p>
<p>但手還在，於是去尋了紙筆來，寫給他们看，把我的名字一簽上，他们同聲：（哦），明白了。我似乎安慰了許多。</p>
<p>於是周游各處，到處用紙筆呼寃，求得安慰。其實究竟有什麽寃枉，連自己也忘却了。但有一次，經過一張門口，兩手把門一推，却看見燈光從後面射來，自己的影子投在對面粉白的牆上，却是一具頭面身體四肢俱全的極美麗的影子。正在欣賞不置，但覺得有人從後面追來，雙手一鬆，投入了黑暗，不知所終。醒來了。……</p>
<p>夢就是這樣子，極無意義，但這是入秋以來第一個夢，不可不記。因筆之如右。醒後還驚惑不已，和人說了一遍，大家輕輕一笑，似乎不足介意似的。</p>
<h3>秋</h3>
<p>— 衛增本</p>
<p>早晨起來，心上流過微微的冷。</p>
<p>（秋，一個聲音在時鐘里　着。多嫵媚啊，這音樂似的聲音！）</p>
<p>披了衣，同往常一樣，在雖不很美却也動人的園子里漫步……</p>
<p>（秋，一個聲音在樹葉間飄着，在溪流外飄着，在紅夜蓓花紫牽牛的頸子前飄着。）</p>
<p>淡的藍天。</p>
<p>淺的藍天上飛過一隻灰色的小鳥。牠唱……秋，秋……</p>
<p>（多嫵媚啊，這音樂似的聲音！）</p>
<p>心上又流過微微的冷，秋的冷。</p>
<p>於是，回到了房里。</p>
<p>（秋，一個聲音在時鐘里響着。）</p>
<p>秋，一個聲音在心上響着。</p>
<h3>旅途雜筆</h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>爲了送妻回家，最近我到了漢口一趟。在漢口只在一宵，而在船上却過了七天七夜。　　閑裹裝忙，便就所聞所見，作旅途雜筆。　　一、船上巡禮</p>
<p>不論是誰，不論他是怎樣的忙，一到船上，便立刻像是從極度緊張中鬆弛過來的發條一樣，懶懶地，一點也不起勁。這兒似乎是一所休憇的别墅，也像是一個有閑的世界。</p>
<p>除了船上的員役以外，你從大菜間而官艙，而房艙，而統艙，這樣巡禮一，週，你所看到的，一言以蔽之，都是悠悠然滿不在乎的神氣。當然，按着船位的等差，這種神氣也就顯示着不同的姿態，而這種不同的姿態，也就正是各個不同的身分的說明。</p>
<p>譬如大菜間，那是在這輪上處於最高地位的一個階層。這一階層的旅客们當然都是高貴的紳士，高貴的太太，成是挺着肚皮的買辦先生，以及公子哥兒小姐之類。在都是穿着輕柔的睡衣，躺在沙發上。假如那是一對兒，便和在公園裹的樹蔭下一樣，温桑地，兩人絮語着。金山蘋菓，美國蜜橘，朱古力糖，滿堆在身邊的茶几上，繊手和小刀從菓皮上掠過，菓皮便緩緩地，迤長地，垂下來。而男的則含着雪茄，輕烟在空中　　地飄。也許旁邊還有一架留聲機，正拖長着聲音在唱（璇宫艶史。）而另外一個房間裹則也許會透出劈拍的牌聲，或是輕微的大烟氣息。總之在大菜間裡，有閑的神氣是華貴的，滿自然的，一點也不裝做。</p>
<p>下來，到官艙，這裡可就差一點兒了，男人们的肚皮挺得要低一點，女人们的梨渦兒可也没有那樣深，成對兒的也許在嚼着點心或水菓之類隨便地談着，而孤身的旅客則多是拉把椅子坐在船欄邊看江水，看向後退的遠山。比大菜間，的確差一點兒，但氣論如何，還是保持了（有錢人）的身分。</p>
<p>再下，便是房艙，小商人，低級從業員，學生，都在這兒，總之這裡是一個爬不進官艙而又不願降入統艙的階層，恰恰說明了一個中間階層的身分，這裡的人有的躺在舖位上看金瓶梅，有的倚在船欄邊哼（妹妹我愛你），有的在嚼花生米，有的在伸長着兩腿瞌睡，有的則在閑談着東西南北天，有的也許在搯着手指愁着眉數他袋裹的錢。當然，在這裡，他们還全是有閑的，不過他们的閑，可就没有大菜問和官艙那樣雍容華貴。</p>
<p>再說到統艙，那可糟了，比較大菜間，可以說一是天堂，而一是地獄。這裡的人都是瘦瘦的，黑黑的，雖然是閑着，可是都帶着焦急的神氣，有的人也胡亂地哼着（孤王酒醉桃花宫）之類，可是聲音有點凄厲，有的人也在吃梨子花生米之類，可是總是那樣地小心，那樣地愛惜。這裡的人可不是閑着，他们只是是無可奈何地暫時被投在這有閑的牢籠裡，各人的心裹正不知怎樣在忙亂焦灼！</p>
<p>人，總是夠聰明的了，他會把社會劃成一些不同的階層，而每一個人又會按着自己的身分投向應投的階層去，這兒，一些也不馬虎，一些也不會錯，你只須在船上巡禮一週，你便可以證實這事實。</p>
<h3>文盲撲滅所（二）</h3>
<p>— 康司坦丁·斐爾作　林　翼　之　譯</p>
<p>馬麗巫福特洛芙娜苦笑了一笑：</p>
<p>（這本書是屠格湼夫的小說，一本俄國的好小說，我想，這是值得你留心的，你唸給我聽。）</p>
<p>（伯札洛夫，這一天，已經不能起來了，）丁加開始唸起來：（他在重苦的，迷迷糊糊的昏睡中，過了一夜……）</p>
<p>丁加不斷的打岔，讀錯，讀到最後一句，再也讀不下去了。</p>
<p>（眞糟，）馬麗巫福特洛芙娜不高興地說：（你在家裹没温習吧，一聽就明白的，用不到强辯，你瞧珂比德金，他在家裹温習了來的，你聽見他唸麽？你應該學學他纔對。）</p>
<p>（他唸的是報紙呀。）丁加反駁了：（那不是我们的鋼廠工人報麽？）</p>
<p>（這有什麽不同！我倒不懂了。）</p>
<p>（爲什麽同呢？這是屠格湼夫呀，那是我们的廠報，唸起報紙來，我還比他好些呢。）</p>
<p>（好没意義，）馬麗巫福特洛芙娜銳聲地說：（恰巧相反呢，印刷的字跡，這兒反而清楚得多呀；好，你就唸唸報紙看，我倒要聽聽你唸報唸得怎樣好？）</p>
<p>丁加從珂比德金手裹拿過了報紙，很流暢的唸了：（幹部問題在我们這裹很是緊迫，我们正苦着人手不夠。强迫就業有怎樣的效力，是很明白的。可是有許多同志，還不理解這事…………）</p>
<p>他停了唸，得意地望望馬麗亞福特洛芙娜。</p>
<p>（這倒有點怪了。）她吃驚地說：（果然唸得很流暢。）</p>
<p>（因爲是我们自己的報紙，不是什麽屠格湼夫呀。）丁加回答了：（你想第一，這兒的事我全知道，我祗要看半句，下半句不看也就明白了。第二，我自己就是工人通信員，這些都是自己寫的；自己寫的東西，自己那會不能唸呢？）</p>
<p>（我眞不懂，）馬麗亞福特洛芙娜還有些莫名其妙，她說：（我想你幾乎讀都不會讀，怎麽會寫的呢？）</p>
<p>（可是情勢却呌我非寫不可呀，在我们工去裹，工作大都是集體的進行，有些人書寫，有些人編輯，又有些人搜集材料，例如闗於幹部的問題丨丨也由我们自己編輯的。你要我連自己的記事都不會讀麽？一個人豈有連自己的記事都不會讀的道理。）</p>
<p>（我不是要你不會讀呀。）馬麗亞福特洛芙娜徐徐地說了。</p>
<p>（至於幹部的問題，）丁加不聽的話，繼續說下去：（幹部問題在我们廠裡實在不容易解决，祗要看熔鐵鑪建設上的土工作業。）</p>
<p>（土工作業跟我有什麽闗係呢？（馬麗亞福特洛芙娜說。</p>
<p>（這樣想頭是不行的，許多人都在這樣想，跟我有什麽闗係。但是勞動是怎樣分配的呢？我倒問你，你這種想頭，能夠進行勞動分配的麽？喂，你說，能夠不能夠？）</p>
<p>（你要我怎樣？）馬麗亞福特洛芙娜問。</p>
<p>（不，不能夠的。）丁如興奮地說：（無論如何，五月十五日第一熔鐵鑪一定要開工的，可是照目前這情形，我们那能開得成？這可是一個問題……）</p>

<h3>中西醫問題之商榷（續）</h3>
<p>至若立法原則，行政系統云云，更不足以制國醫條例之發展，不觀乎提案者爲中央委員乎？提案之處，爲中央政治會議乎？試思立法程序，何自而產生？行政系統，何自而議定？苟政治會議而認爲行政系統宜更張也者，則提議改正，烏乎不可，纂奪云者，其義何居？試觀焦先生不嘗云乎（國醫館使命，在補救行政系統的缺憾，）故以紊亂行政系統責提議者，亦無謂之舉也。</p>
<p>是故今之國醫條例者，就學術立法而言，旣不足以破之，就民情而言，且足以助之，則國醫條例之爲物，其果於國事毫無衝突，而得聽其圓滿成立乎？是又不然，蓋國醫條例之破壞性，獨對於衛生行政之本身而已，姑不論衛生行政，在在立脚於新醫學，曰掃除污物也，曰禁絶鴉片也；曰預防瘟疫也；若是等等，均以新醫學爲根據，而預防瘟疫與衛生統計，且非新醫莫屬，舊醫實妨礙之。若國家而永久認舊醫爲正式醫師，則傳染病條例，等諸空文，一切衛生統計，永無完備之日。吾故曰，今之國醫條例存，則衛生行政亡，勢不兩立，理所當然，是國醫條例者，謂之破壞行政系統則不當，謂之驅逐衛生行政則非誣也。敢請中央委員再思之三思之，今之國醫條例者，是破壞衛生行政於萬刦不磨之地也。國家而不欲衛生行政則已矣，非然者，則國醫條例，不能以此方式出之，可以斷言。</p>
<p>雖然，在國醫條例未提出以前，衛生行政，果未亡乎，鴉片流毒之等於洪水猛獸也，竭其迎合趨逢之能事矣，禁絶之策，果安在乎？鼠疫霍亂，年年威懾於南北各省也，間或藉疫苗爲能事矣，調查統計之政績，果安在乎？省縣各城市，置污物滿街於不顧，且假衞生之名以歛錢也，則褎如充耳矣，法令實行之步驟，果安在乎？即就醫師條例之本身而言，旣不圖澈底解决於衛生部成立之日，復隠忍苟安於醫師條例被改之時，乏雄辯服人之勇，無去就立爭之節，敷衍因循，坐而致敵，欲人之不乘其懈，其可得乎？吾以爲苟衛生當局，能移其用於零星瑣事之精神，灌注於大政大策，節其送往迎來於外容之心機，作疏說衛生行政之精髄於中央委員之前者，迨巳消彌政潮於無形乎？今不此之圖，徒弄延宕小策，暫且不行西醫二字，旣不能令，又不受命，自絶於物，沽人之怒，是國醫條例之提議，衛生當局，有以自招之也。</p>
<p>或問曰：然則以衛生行政爲中心，則處理舊式中醫，果由何道呼？曰，是則於政情財情，大有闗焉。苟爲財政情形所許，而又於敎育行政所可能者，則定其步驟，訂其年限，新醫與舊醫，一方漸增，一方漸減，所謂國醫條例之方針，當然異矣。苟爲政情財情所不許，而暫時無添加醫校與新醫之希望者，則管理機闗，甲乙無分彼此，内政部若可，國醫館何獨不可，爭之者有所爲也，辯之者阿其私也，鷄蟲蝸角，吾不欲論之矣。</p>
<p>嗟乎！政治不可因循也，般政策不可含混也，吾敢爲中央委員切言之，在中央統觀吾國大局，以爲衛生行政可積極進行也，則宜速定衞生大政之方針，限年處理舊式中醫，亦其一端耳。苟以爲政情財情闗係，不能積極進行，則宜速示衛生行政之範圍，儼然限其年份，而許舊醫爲醫師可耳，慎母聽其零星招謡，浮誇粉飾，外啓挪揄之譏，内生紛歧之擾，則國家幸甚，民族幸甚。</p>
<h3>焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國書人之商榷（續）</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>至於學術上互相研究的話，我是很贊成的，只要他们肯服從眞理，回向科學，我是無有不接受的。今年二月間，陸君淵雷有信給我，問我到上海國醫分館襄而去担任研究委員，願意不願意，我却不答應他。我本想喚醒舊醫，陶鑄舊醫的，陸君來信又是說是誠擊懇切，金石爲開，并且說是出於分館主事諸君的誠意，這件事剛剛可以合我的心願，爲什麽不答應陸君呢？我第一：觀察到國人對於情理兩字，不能分别，年來主張保守國醫的人们，大多數都是感情作用、從學理上立定脚跟的是狠少。第二：觀察到國醫内部不統一，一方面請我研究整理，一方面駡我是醫賊，丨丨長沙中醫會，丨丨一方面提倡統一病名，以爲觀察樂效基礎，丨丨施今晨，丨丨一方面竭力反對，以爲國體攸闗，丨丨上海某某中醫學會，丨丨所以我認爲時機未熟。第三：研究工作是要有設備，有地方，紙上談兵是設用的，敎國醫館設立研究所，恐怕辦不到。因這三個理由，所以只好辜負陸君一片熱忱，不能就聘。最近八月二十五日晨報上（中國醫藥）有署名（志仁）的一位先生，也有希望我來領導的話，高誼厚情，感謝很狠，只是在這樣環境當中，如何做得？只看焦先生這驚告國人書，無一句不是誣罔，無一句不是意氣，純粹是感情作用，那裹還有什麽學理可講？極度被感情蒙蔽了，還有什麽理智可說呢？唉！陸君呀！志仁君呀！上海國醫分館主笨諸君呀！不是我高自位置，鐵石心腸，不肯和國醫们互騐研究，諸君看！和完全感情用事，没有理智的人去共同工作，能保不事事掣肘麽？佛說：（我不入地獄，誰入地獄。）確是大慈悲家的口吻，但是入了地獄，果眞有益，到也不妨去入一入，諸君看！和這樣人共同工作，能得有成績麽？到後來，有志未逮，一事不成，一個人的名譽不足惜，對於科學化的前途，豈不要又加一重障礙麽？所以我以爲在衆醉未醒的時代，還是需要學理的宣傳，我這　商榷，並不是對於焦先生個人爲難，也是一篇痛哭流涕的告國人書罷了。吾舌尙存，人心未死，中國尙未滅亡到凈盡時候，我的憂國熱涙是没有一日乾燥的，救國熱血，是不會一日冷却的，無論那一方面，只要有誠意，有理智，我们决不拒絶互相研究。</p>
<p>至於從學術上相互研究以後，要想成爲一種新醫學，走上一條新經路，恐怕有點誇大妄想。照我的眼光看過去；有三點是可以有希望的，第一：從我國藥物中發現幾種功効優秀的成分，在藥物療法上新占幾個重要位置。第二：把現在專門研究尖銳化的世界醫學，補助他一點概念化。這個意思，我答覆陸君淵雷論國醫學術整理草案中，已經詳細謹論過了。丨丨二十年十二月十六日社會醫報丨丨至少限度，還有一件事可以辦得到，就是，新醫多用幾種國產藥物，少用幾種外國藥，也不無少補。譬如發汗解熱藥，我國也狠有幾種，輕微的感冒，喫了也能夠出汗，也能夠好。還有瀉藥，我國也有大黄芒硝等等，甚而至於巴豆，緩瀉急瀉，都有辦法，假如碰着只要大便一通就可以好的病，就用用大黄芒硝等等，也會奏效，不必定要用　麻子油，水菓鹽，嬰孩自己片。還　　胃　　化的　·厚　·　　，神　·也有相當效力，不限定要用苦　　，芳香　，番木　，俄電克乎。我以爲這一點事情，是可以做得到的。至於新的醫事，新的路徑，從學理上探討記來，恐怕是精神異常的人们一種誇大妄想。</p>
<p>焦先生說：辛亥革命以來，國家　　人對於西醫，開學校，辦學院，派送學生留學各國，所費金錢，不知　幾許許。西醫學成之後，學術方面未能差强人意，却是資本主義的習氣，深深地領會得來，每見他们看一次病，藥費的視人論值，成爲很平常事體，他如檢查須納檢查費、注射須納注射費，敷洗包紮須納敷洗包紮費，正規診金似亦不過一元兩元，是諸等等所謂手續費者，可以多至十元二十元。）我曉得焦先生對於西醫的學術，是門外溪，（未能差强人意）的一句判斷，恐怕不是從學理上探討出來的話。依我所曉得的，中國人科學醫的本領，確實一天一天高强起來，外國人也一天一天認識起來了，和外國比較，確能夠並駕齊驅，總理說（學外國科學不是難事）的話，確實是千眞萬確。不過環境不好，弄得英雄無用武之地，不能夠充分施展手脚。這是國家和社會辜負科學醫家，不是科學醫家辜負國家社會。焦先生呀！國不呀！請仔細想一想！我们貴中國的國家，派送留學生，向來是和别國不同。當派送的時候，像煞是樂育人材，等到學成歸國，却不去想想利用他的方法，安置他的位置，在憑他们散漫遊衍，一輩子不管，於是乎學工回來的，却去做商，學農回來的，却去趕做官生活，而且所做的商，所做的官，和他所學的，又是完全不相干。請問敎他们如何施展才學呢。統盤都是如此，何獨醫學呢？金錢用得不得當，費了金錢，不收實效，顯然是政治未良，立法未善的結果，反要責備我们，豈是天提良心的話。</p>
<p>資本主意領會得來的話，却是不錯，我也深深地痛感到此。但不過是一部分少數的人们，斷不是大多數都是如此。尤其是在大財主麾下立脚的一班人，住的是洋房，冬天熱水汀，夏天冷氣室，他们見慣了，却忘了自己的祖國同胞，還住在草棚裹面。譬如大觀園的一班丫環，見慣了豪貴奢華，忘却自己的出身，却還來竊笑劉老老。更加之以派别觀念，勢利思想，於是乎仗着大財主的後臺老板，盡情的向替國家爭體面，不求外援的窮苦同道，加以壓迫排斥，陰謀詭計，無所不用其極。他们的眼光，他们的心思，只有金錢，那裹認識得國家社會，開刀幾千兩，接產幾百兩，向着病人壓榨點金　出來，是當然分内的事情，值得什麽大驚小怪丨但是焦先生和國人丨不要認錯了少數人的行動，當做大多數的罪孽，來鍛練一舞科學醫家。并且這是個人行爲，和學術興廢没有闗係，用不着在採行國醫條例的選目上做文章，我認爲文不對題。只要政治上了軌道，各方面過分的行動，都是很容易改良的吓。</p>
<p>焦先生說：（西醫取費旣昻，引起國醫診金亦卽隨之增昻，間接提高社會民衆之疾病的負擔，這要算誰的過處呢？）照焦先生這樣說來，西醫罪大惡極，死有餘辜了，不但自己領會了資本主義，并且，引誘良家子弟，把貞潔的國醫们的心恩，也敎壞了，也把資本主義深深地領會來了。他们爲什麽不領會科學思想，單單引起診金增昻呢？可說只會學壞樣，不會學好樣。徐靈眙那時候，恐怕還没有西醫罷，他的贄金，非百金不可，這個資本主義，是從那個留學生地方領會來的呢？陶隠居的時代，恐怕還没有西醫罷，他的名醫别錄序例說道；（虚搆聲稱，多納金帛。）這個資本主義，是那個留學生去引起的呢？唉！焦先生！一個立法院的法制委員的長，發表一篇告國人書，似乎應該有相當的穏重才是吓！</p>
<p>焦先生說：（但西醫增多診價，誠能符合一分洋鈿一分貨的話，自亦不妨，而一核其成績，則又令人失望，現在且舉一個他们對於霍亂的例子來說：霍亂是有菌的傳染病，殺菌消毒爲西醫最擅長的本領，近來各地衛生行政，旣由西醫管理，一遇時竐發生，宜若可以高下從心，妥求撲滅。乃去年廣州發生霍亂，報紙所載，祗自六月十九日至二十一日，三日中間，因霍亂死亡，棺木銷售多至八百具，其有貧苦無從盛殮者，尙不在内。嗣聞出陜兩省，亦發生是項時疫，衛生署撥巨額國幣，派員救濟，結果，死人纍纍，達數十萬。這些負責衛生行政的人，旣不能防之於前，又不能治之於後，平日徒事排擠國　，反躬自問，能無惭愧。）這是焦先生責備衛生行政的人们無能力，同時表示西醫治疫無能力，請問這時候國醫躱在那裡？焦先生躱在那裡？如果有較好辦法，較高明手段，何以不率領貴國醫館的人才，來施</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>能爲，救濟民衆？臨時袖手旁觀，畏難藏拙，風潮過了，却出來講風凉話，這種行爲，最於人格有闗我希望焦先生引導國人到高尙一條路上去。唉！國人吓！治疫的方法，最要緊是把最初第一個發生疫病的人，嚴密地趕快隔離。所以做醫生的人，對於傳染病的智識，不可不有，否則，貽害社會，不可計數，眞是危險萬分，我们貴中國，平日放着診察不精確而且多數反對細菌的貴國醫，布滿社會，臨陣碰着惡疫，只認做伏暑，滯積縱敵玩宼，任他蔓延，敎術生行政的人，怎樣預防？等到大火燎原，不責備平時反對細菌的罪過，不覺悟臨陣診察不精確的錯誤，不自認禍國殃民，却來責備西醫高下從心，眞是抹煞良心了。請問大禹治水，費了幾年。前年揚子江流域大水，費了幾時治好的呢？去年被疫的災區多少廣大？所撥的國幣有多少巨額？平時衛生經費有多少？比較權景，眞是可憐得狠，幸而有民間慈善團體來相輔助，勉强還可敷衍，不然，無米之炊，巧婦難爲，做公婆的還要毒駡他没用，未免太兇惡了。請問這件防疫的事，敎貴國醫館人才辦起來，預算是多少呢？計劃是怎樣呢？方法是什麽呢？請發表高見，從學理上探討一下，再來告國人罷！</p>
<h3>新藥整理芻議</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>新藥充斥，於今爲極，滬上一隅，已爲各國藥商競售之塲。夫藥之爲物，與民命有闗，藥物愈多，斯民命愈得保障，厭其多而屏之，與認爲舶來而不用者，皆一偏之見也。惟是新藥云者，其類至繁，有有效者，有無效者，有有流弊者，亦有有危險者，外國藥商之銷售良藥於吾國者固無論矣丨亦有一二不肖之徒，挾其經濟侵略之野心，舉其國内所不敢售不敢試夫與過期失效之藥品，悉數推銷於吾國之市塲，吾國政府旣襲於外勢莫敢誰何。即使稍加限制，而對於吾國之公令，亦向抱熟視無睹之態度。一二醫界同人之稍加以正當批評者，亦不惜威脅利誘以箝制其言語，於是全國同胞，悉爲各國新藥之試騐品矣！今試縱觀歐美，有外藥輸入漫無限制如吾國者乎？有未經本國政府之審查，而藥商敢公然競售如吾國者乎？興言及此，良用痛心。夫藥無中外，惟良者佳，果爲治病之良方，即有提倡之必要。特是眞僞混雜，則黑白難分，優劣淆亂，則是非莫辯，無論何事，莫不皆然，矧夫藥物之動闗民命者乎？當此政府無權過問之時，人民無力鑑别之際，舍我輩醫師，出任新藥之整理，殆無他法，夫售藥者商，而用藥者醫，不加重理，其何以盡使用之方針，而救民命於萬一乎。此龐京周醫師於去歳醫師公會秋季大會席上所以有組織新藥整理委員會之提議也。延及一載，未見施行，可爲深喟。夫本會之設，雖以整理新藥命名，而實以提倡良藥爲宗旨，整理之工作愈勤，良藥之銷路愈廣，且藥旣日良，則其無新舊中外之見，更可不言而喻。蓋當此國產新藥青黄不接之際，固有不能不用舶來良藥之苦衷。然則本會云者，非獨醫界所當疾起而速圖，而亦忠實之藥商，所宜額手而稱慶者也。爰訂辦法，以爲龐氏提案之補充。</p>
<p>（一）通告全國藥商，彚送樣品至本會登記以備介紹。</p>
<p>（二）組織藥品化騐委員會，以化騐下列各種藥品。</p>
<p>（一）未標明藥方及成分之藥品。</p>
<p>（二）無說明書之藥品。</p>
<p>（三）經多數醫師報告認爲效用可疑之藥品。</p>
<p>（三）製造表册，凡合於下列條件之一者，認爲良藥列入之：</p>
<p>（一）經多數本國醫師臨牀報告認爲有效者。</p>
<p>（二）經多數外國醫師臨牀報告認爲有效者。</p>

<p>（五）標明藥方及成分於藥瓶封闗之上者。</p>
<p>（四）將上列表册通告全國醫界，以備採用。</p>
<p>此上所言僅余個人之一種計劃，至於實行之步驟與辦法，則仍須俟本會組織後始可定也，企予望之。</p>
<h3>歐洲之藥學敎育與藥師資格之養成（一）</h3>
<p>民歐洲之藥房制度。已於本刋前數期略事例論。其組織完善。營業正規。名義上難是商店。實則不啻爲藥師服務於社會之正式機闗。與他種公務人員供職於公共機闗同一意義。况藥品有闗生命。藥師職責等於醫師。故歐洲之正式藥房。均係藥師所設。換言之。非受藥學敎育者。不得開設藥舖。非制限過於綦嚴。實以民命爲重。爲立法之根本點也。其設施藥學敎育之制度。即以藥房營業之制度爲根據。餐成合格之藥師。與有闗藥學事業之人材。窺其敎育。以學生之經騐與學理並重。爲歐洲各國藥學敎育之標凖制度也。茲彚述如次。</p>
<p>一，德國藥學校共有數十所。本科招收高級中學之畢業生。使受五年實地練習。及二年之藥學課程。其入飲食物化學科者。則需三年。至於修習博士學位。約爲四年。藥師資格之完成。須歷下列三步。</p>
<p>（一）初試騐　概以口試。筆試。及實地試行之。其與試資格須兼具下之二項。（一）高級中學畢業。且諳拉丁文。（二）從藥師學習二年。得有證書。</p>
<p>（二）州考試（或省試）亦爲口試。筆試。及實地試。其與試資格。須兼具下之三項。（一）有初試及格證書。（二）在德國正式藥房曾任助理藥師一年。得有證書。（三）在德國大學藥科肄業二年。得有證書。</p>
<p>（三）候補藥師　即考取藥師後。尙須經二年之正式藥房見習。方可領到在德境開業之藥師執照。</p>
<p>二，法國藥科大學之程度頗高。計有馬賽。里愛爾。葛比沈。康色地。克斯克勒蒙脫。弗蘭特。及素負盛名之巴黎藥學校等。進藥科大學前之先具資格爲得有學士學位。或有相當程度。而有一年藥房實習之經騐者。入學考試及第後。修業四年。（理論與實習）至畢業後方可爲藥師。藥師旣畢業於大學後。不僅作藥師分内應有之職業上練習。又須爲醫師或公衆作進一步之分析。與其他化學的或顯微鏡的工作。尙有藥師專習化學而有特長者。故亦有稱化學師者。巴黎藥科大學之學生一千餘人。女生居三分之一。然此過額之培植。固不僅爲藥房執業計。但求畢業生能有極深邃之科學的修養。則在在皆有容納之餘地。原不必僅以小本藥商爲唯一之出路也。法國藥學校修習藥學博士之科程。爲五年制。即於普通四年後。續增一年。並須作論文一篇即可。（未完）</p>
<h3>上海市近十年來醫藥烏瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第六章　醫藥敎育與刋物　第二節　舊醫藥敎育</p>
<p>對於醫藥抱羣衆觀念的人，本來很少，尤其是在富翁與大老中，所以每每聽見他们概嘆着說：（現在好舊醫只剩某先生，他兒孫不能繼業，究竟差得多，此人若死，弱一個了。）等等語調，足見迷信舊醫的人，也未嘗不知道舊醫有每况愈下的趨勢，而他们的心理，不過是（儘我這一輩子，反正有錢請二十四元一次出診的舊醫，將來後輩和平民的醫藥就管不了許多咧。）這一種心理，與前三章所述富翁大老们請洋人看病，完全一轍。</p>
<p>另外一班大老，因住慣西人療養院，又兼請舊醫服湯頭，偶然得些小效，就瘋狂似的頑起國醫館的把戲來了。保存國粹，整理舊學，一時頗動觀聽，好像熱心得似菩薩一樣，然而一種考究，原來毫無價值，近二年間，批評些皆是國醫館的文字，散見各報章雜誌的，比比皆是，我也不必再多費筆墨。如今只須介紹二篇扼要的文字與讀者，巳將國醫館的精神軀殻，解析得夠了。其一是余雲岫所著，（讀國醫館整理學術草案之我見），載醫藥評論第一○五期，其二並且是中醫做的（中央國醫館過去之無能，及今後之展望）。著者范天磐，見本年六月行世的（國醫評論）第一卷第一期。</p>
<p>我如今再概括的說：國醫館旣不敢像漢晋唐宋的醫家，搬弄陰陽六氣，著書立說，爲後世醫者做藍本，只想依權附勢，做元明清初的太醫院，束控制儕輩。（國醫條例破壞行政系統就是爲此）。又不敢像民國九十年間的中醫學校，廣收學生，來造學校舊醫，（因爲現在招進的中學生，很易倒他们的戈）。只想團結現在的要人御醫，再收羅些以前襲取過新醫皮毛的團醫，營私投機，硬把玄學帶上科學帽子，呌作（用科學方法整理舊醫藥），來欺朦世人，如今的國醫館，並没有科學家在内，倘使國醫館的生命，爲要人勉强維持下去，倒難免科學敗類，受政客利用，受金錢吸引，（人是人學是學）混些進去，那時候各種科學的名稱，必被利用得道道地地，科學的精髄，還是不能發揮，只看佛慈藥廠的電氣人參膏，以及煎藥接方的藥店，就是一個榜樣，好在要人腦中，對於科學眞意義的界說，也就是如此罷了。</p>
<p>至於眞正用科學眼光來看舊醫書，倒底怎樣呢？這個問題，有余雲岫先生的二部醫學革命論集，已抉發了大半，根本旣經推翻，舊醫學實在無敎育上的途徑可尋，只剩藥物經騐，始終有記載的價值。總而言之，保存國醫，母寗說研究國藥，來得痛快，舊醫的淘汰，雖然是遲早間事情，然而過渡中間，恐怕還有些波折，預料國醫館這一派如果得勢，則純粹授徒的一派，必受排擠，因爲他们連一頂科學帽子都不會帶，自然先爲一知半解社會所唾棄，所以在國醫科學化的呼聲中間，國醫倒要先起三角的内鬨，一是國醫館派，二是純舊式的授徒派；三是覺悟的舊醫。（就是中醫學校的最清醒分子）。這時候新醫的呼聲，完全不是攻擊舊醫，實在是一句感化他们的口號，呌做（世界大同的醫學，是一條光明坦蕩的大道，請諸君放棄邪說，一齊光臨，並無門户阻隔！</p>
<h3>美容衛生法序</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>吾人愛美之感情，所包甚廣，如欣賞於文藝，陶醉於音樂，遊覽天然之山水，怡情四時之景物，披閱古人之法書名畫，鐘鼎彝器，石像雕刻等，皆審美之感情也。夫文藝音樂山水景物等，皆身外之物也，身外之物，雖可貴，較諸吾身則賤，欲愛外物之美，宜先愛吾身之美，於是美容衛生之法尙矣。</p>
<p>歐洲有（從肥皂之肖費額，可以判其國之文野）一語，誠最能道著文化生活之警語也。人之潔其容，潔其手，潔其全身，潔其衣服，不但爲個人健康上所必要，並可與周圍之人以好感，可稱日常生活中之最要事也。</p>
<p>世上有生而具麗質者，亦有生而其貌不揚者。夫其貌不揚，雖曰出自先天，無可奈何，但若能自嬰兒幼年時代，即深加注意，亦有一部份可彌補其先天之不足，使之美化。在巳入文化生活之現代人，尤理應自頭至足用心，使自己滿意，並同時與人以快感也。</p>
<p>最近似因美容之呼聲甚高，無論爲男爲女，對於頭，對於髮，對於衣服，對於化妝，皆能有與時代相副之技巧，洵屬可喜。然此等技巧。無論如何完全，若爲其基礎之肉體有貧血結核全身虚弱等之缺憾，則無論如何盡善盡美之化妝，亦不過爲一時之粉飾，而究非眞美。如欲顯其眞美，非與身體之健康相副，不可，故無論生來之美醜，設身體有不滿意之處者，應即加以補救。故美容術當以衛生法爲之基礙也。</p>
<p>余於診病之暇，留意美容衛生有年矣，近復鍊習體育，因編纂美容衛生法一書，自嬰兒以至成人。凡姿勢步行顔貌衣服，以及頭髮眼鼻口唇皮膚筋肉乳腹手足指爪等之美容術，無不言之綦詳，又有天生之缺憾，如斜視兎唇面　腋臭赤鼻秃髮貧血等皆有詳細之補救法，無不一一著之於編，此外如顔面之按摩，及沐浴與水治法，光線與空氣療法等，與美容術有密切之闗係者，皆詳述於編末，學者果照此實行，非但得美容之益，其全體亦必健康矣。迨吾體旣健，吾容旣美之後，大則延賞天地間大自然之美景，小則佈置一室中之器具，無一不含美術思想，細至一花一草之插於膽瓶，一拳石一小魚之置於瓦盆者，無不一一精究其方法，寧非愉快事哉。由一身而及於外物，凡研究美術者之次第當如此也。世有駝其背，跛其足，污其手，憔悴其顔面，垢穢其衣服，怯弱其身體者，而曰美術家，美術家，則吾不之信矣。</p>
<h3>新醫藥發達過程中幾個重要的發見和發明（九）</h3>
<p>Z&gt;顧壽白</p>
<p>這欒琴氏所發見的放射線便是有名的Ｘ綫。他的發見，雖是近乎偶然，其實這發見的基礎却胚胎於以前赫雷兩氏所研究的陰極綫。這陰極線究竟是甚麽東西，現在也有順便叙述一下的必要。　　西曆一千七百三十年左右曾經有人通電流於感應圈，將那陰陽兩極離開一二寸，忽見其間有紫紅色的火光迸射出來，同時還發出一種聲音丨丨這稱爲火花放電。又看見兩極間的空氣稀簿的時候，這放電的狀態就大不相同。後來將金屬棒兩條對向着封入玻璃管内，漸漸抽出管内的空氣，又見那放電的狀態變成刷毛狀，最後全玻璃管就都充滿着燦爛的光芒。</p>
<p>其後經過了一百年左右，德國的蓋司勒（Ｇeissler）氏將前人的裝置改造一下，在玻璃管的兩端，熔封着兩條白金綫，又用自己發明的水銀排氣機將管内的空氣充分抽出；反覆試騐的結果發見空氣尙未抽盡的時候，管内充着紫色的光，等到空氣充分抽去，那光就漸漸地分成一段一段，彷彿和蛇腹的鱗片一樣，並且這種的光是和陽極連續着的，至於那陰極方面，只有少許微光罷了。這種裝置就是今日的蓋司勒氏管。</p>
<p>若是再將這蓋司勒氏管内的空氣充分抽盡，那蛇腹狀的紋理就更擴大起來，同時那陽極所發幾乎占領着全管的光芒就漸漸縮小下去而轉成黑暗，同時陰極方面的小光點却又膨大起來；不過這陰極的光很是稀薄，不易直接看見，只能由其所照射的玻璃管壁變成黄色的一點證明這光的存在，這就是所謂陰極線　　充分研究陰極線的學者要算英國的苦魯克（Ｃroolce）氏，所以那發生陰極綫的眞空管就稱爲苦魯克氏管。這陰極線的主要性質大抵如下：（一）一直進行；（二）與物體衝突的時候，發生强度的熱；（三）與物體面衝突的時候，要發生壓力；（四）遇着硫化鈣，玻璃等物，能使牠们放出强度的螢光；（五）遇着强度的磁石，能轉換方向。據其後的研究，纔知道這陰極線的本體是一種高速度的電子流。</p>
<p>一個眞空管内陰極線由陰極一直向前進行與玻璃管壁衝突的時候，能使其放出螢光若在管的中間用一定形狀丨例如十字形丨的金屬板擋住，那後面就要現出一個黑影。</p>
<p>其後到了一千八百十三年，赫爾茲氏又在苦魯克氏管内陰極的對面，嵌了一個錫質的小窗，試騐起來，發見這陰極綫能夠通過射出。後來他的門徒雷那（Ｌenard）氏在一千八百九十四至九十五兩年間，將這透過鋁窗的陰極線再加研究，其結果，除了知道這種陰極線和管内的陰極綫性質還是相同而外，又發見這綫有寫眞作用，並能透過如水晶的物體，還能將空氣變爲導體。這些特性都和今日的Ｘ綫很相似。</p>

<h3>洋米與中國之闗係</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>一　洋米之來源</p>
<p>洋米於何時與我國發生闗係，遠者不可得知，史書所見，古昔與西南諸夷互市，香料，藥材，與珍奇之品而已。其時嚴海禁，互市至難，量多價賤之物，宜或不在懋遷之列，故採辦洋米，見之於書，已在清康熙年間。所謂洋米，大抵産於安南，暹邏，缅甸，印度，台灣，朝鮮，及南洋羣島等地。以上諸地，在四五十年前，大都非我領土，卽我屬地。乃自缅甸淪於英，发南夷於法，台灣朝鮮割於日，而後接濟祖國之米，乃一變而爲進口之洋米，言之滋痛。</p>
<p>二　免稅之經過</p>
<p>我國素以食爲民天，故重積儲，嚴漏洋。而糧食之自外來，則以爲接濟我民食，招徠之，奬掖之，又惟恐不至。閩粤兩省，環山帶海，地狹人稠，缺糧尤鉅，雖有長江流城剩餘之米以相接濟，猶愚不給。於是閩粤兩省之民食，不得不另闢蹊徑，以圖補充。此外尙有浙之寗波，亦缺米。康熙六十一年，清聖祖聞暹邏米賤，一石祇值銀二三錢，（其時中國米大約在一兩光景）遂囑其運三十萬石至廣東福建寗波等處販賣，免其稅。至乾隆時，並照其運米之多寡，酌免隨帶船貨之稅，又奬勵閩粤商民如能往安南暹邏等國販運米殺回國接濟者，按其所運多寡，給予官職。蓋當時重洋險阻，販運不易，損失堪虞，非若今之汽船，履險如夷，儎量亦鉅，往來便捷也。</p>
<p>自雍正六年進口米穀，經部議不必上稅著爲例。（本國米有稅，乾隆時曾一度豁免，旋卽復，）其後中外通商之局面成，與外國訂立通商章程，亦將進口米穀之免稅，列入其中，最先見者，爲咸豐八年中英通商章程第二欵，此後與美，法，德……諸國，訂立章程，皆有此同樣一欵。（按所列免稅之物甚多，幾可謂凡外人日用生活起居各物，皆得免稅）直至辛丑和約成，免稅始限於米糧麵粉金銀等物也，惟以前免徵洋米稅，係一種優惠待遇，卽無須洋米接濟時，原未嘗不可以徵稅。自經列入約章，乃受條約之拘束，一變向所特予之優惠，而爲共守之義務。後此卽欲徵稅，遂致多所窒礙。今則闗稅業經自主，麵粉亦已徵稅，則米麥徵稅，當可無甚問題，卽有之亦不難藉當局折衝之力，以求實現也。（註一）</p>
<p>三　洋米進口之趨勢</p>
<p>全國洋米進口，歳有幾何，在昔不可得考。但其數量必無多，緣當時洋米，大都以接濟粤省爲多，閩則尙有　米接濟也。自同治六年以來，進口洋米，始有闗册可查。然自同治六年至光緒十二年之二十年間，逐年進口之洋米數，最少爲六千餘担，大都在數萬担及數十萬担之間，絶少超過百萬担。及光緒十三年至民國九年之三十四年中，逐年進口洋米，常在數百萬担，然亦難得超過千萬担，自民國八九兩年產米區域，號稱豐收，曾一度出口外，嗣後並因種種闗係，洋米進口，自民國十年起，至民國二十一年止，此十二年中，歳有鉅額，恒在千餘萬担以上，最高曾超過二千萬担也。茲爲便於閱覽起見，列表於左。</p>
<p>時期　年數　逐年洋米進口約數　備　考</p>
<p>（一）同治六年至光緒十二年○二在百萬担以下同治十二年光緒三年超過百萬担（二）光緒十三年至民國九年三四千萬担以下光緒卅一卅三年民國九年超過千萬担</p>
<p>（三）民國十年至民國廿一年一二千萬担至二千餘萬担</p>
<p>觀上表，可見洋米進口之趨勢，於不定之年數内，可分爲三時期，而以愈至近代，進口愈多，此其故可深長思也。</p>
<p>四　進口糧食徵稅運動之經過</p>
<p>進口糧食徵稅之說，發動於上海市糧麥委員會。該會成立於民國十八年。是年六月，該會卽提出一案，爲改訂糧食進口稅則，限制食糧進口，維護本國農業。當經建請於當局，乃由財部交稅則委員會參考了事。該會又於民國十九年繼續建議，復由滬市政府總呈中央，乃有内政財政農礦等部另案核定後再行議辦之語。（註二）至民國廿年，中央民食委員會亦有重訂米麥麵粉進口稅率之擬議。二十一年中央復由財部召集實業内政兩部，及各省市民政機闗代表，舉行食糧會議。大致議决（一）謀國内自由流　，不得徵稅，一面徵洋米傾銷稅，米價自九元至十五元時，課以百分之三十遞减的傾銷稅，然亦議而未行。本年以來，米價一落不復振，（但應注意者，滬市現用市斛，較海斛小一斗有餘，價格理應低小。）農村經濟破產之聲浪亦日高。至是產米區域，如鄂湘皖贛蘇諸省政府，鑒於大勢所趨，亦電請行政院，徵收洋米進口稅，隨而和之者遂衆。進口米麥之徵稅，大約經過立法程序，當可實現矣。</p>
<p>五　粤省與洋米之闗係</p>
<p>歷年以來，因國内各方面不良影響之結果，洋米乃成爲不可或缺之進口商品，（本年當然是例外）但食米而缺米之省分，爲浙·閩·與廣東，北方尙有天津。浙省仰給於蘇皖，除非蘇皖不豐收，而始取給於洋米。閩則仍賴臺米接濟，（在目下亦爲進口貨）然閩省缺米最甚者，爲泉漳兩屬，而無粤省所缺之鉅。粤則除有皖米接濟外，一則以地域的闗係，再則以歷史的闗係，三則以商業的闗係，大部分需要洋米供給。故洋米與粤省民食，其闗係較中國任何一省爲密切，試觀左表，卽可了然矣。</p>

<p>民國二十一年　一三、五七六、五四一　六三·五</p>
<p>按粤省洋米，對全國進口洋米百分比之增减，非全爲粤省糧產豐收之表示，而爲全國產米區域歉收，食糧不足，進口洋米激增之反映。如民國二十年，粤省進口之洋米，尙有五百十餘萬擔，而其對進口洋米總量之百分比，落至百分之二五·七、此爲十八年長江一帶秋收荒歉，及十九年匪共爲患之影響，因之而其他各地進口糧食激增，粤省洋米之比率不覺爲之低落也。（按是年長江一帶口岸連浙省在内，洋米進口一千二百四十餘萬擔，）粤省旣歳需鉅額洋米，故去年有徵稅之說，卽有反對之舉。乃本年中央對於洋米徵稅，尙在籌備之中，粤財廳卽已通告開徵洋米稅，米·每百斤爲一元，穀·每百斤爲六角。連日報載，米商雖有反對之說，固不知其理由何在，但急遽施行，而貽反對洋米進口稅者以口實，亦非計之得者也。</p>
<p>六　洋米與本米之比較</p>
<p>洋米因多數經過檢查手續，故身骨大都整潔乾燥，脹性較佳，價格復廉，加以我國不僅素來缺米之省分缺米，卽素來多米之省分亦有時而缺米，此洋米所以源源而來，而金錢滾滾以去也。然而江西晚米，安徽上等秈米，亦可抵暹邏米及一號西貢米，次則亦可抵二號西貢米，及小絞米。粤省米價，據向本市米業查詢所得，本米低於洋米約五角之譜。故如粤微洋米稅每百斤爲一元，而本米能保持原狀，則洋米雖以地域上之便利，終不能爭勝於市塲，此誠粤省經營洋米商之致命傷也。不幸我國產米之區，兵匪連年，水旱洊至，米業又無相當之組織，米質復不經檢查，政府祗顧財政上之收入，未嘗一爲農民經濟着想。旣無一能與洋米爭勝，交通運輸，又節節多阻隔，此進口洋米之所以年增一年，而無法抵制也。若此後仍不爲調節整頓及增加生產之舉，徵稅之結果，恐仍無補於農業而或有害於民食，此則深望兼籌並顧者也。（註四）</p>

<h3>從救濟農村論洋米征稅</h3>
<p>— 魏友秦</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>因救濟農村研究的結果，數月來各處就有要求政府微收米麥進口稅之提議。九月十七日上海市雜糧油餅同業公會打給行政院財政部的電報，也以爲年來米麥麵粉，價格慘落的原因，在洋米麥粉侵銷本　市楊之故。所以加課洋米麥粉傾銷稅，限制其入口，爲救濟農商之先决問題。</p>
<p>十八日立法院院長孫科發表全國經濟委員會的今後工作目標之談話中，有一段是對洋米徵稅而發的。他分析國内國產產米麥銷路阻塞，價格低落，形成農村經濟破產的原因爲（一）米　組織不良，粤桂各地米商多向安南及　　定米，長江一帶，雖屬產米之區，銷略反致　　。（二）洋麥質凈量多，　價便宜。（三）海闗對於糧食進口，素不徵稅，因此得以傾銷内地，國產米麥反遭打擊。孫院長最後說：財政部最近　訂新稅則之時，對於洋米洋麥之進口，决定徵稅，以救濟農村云。同時並聞財政實業内政交通鐵道五部，也定期開會，商議徵稅之辦法，如此則洋米徵稅，已有從建議而到實行之趨勢了。</p>
<p>洋米徵稅，在理論上，當然是對的，但在救濟農村的立塲上言，分析起來，可以見得有幾點是好的，也有幾點是窒礙的。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我们考求農村衰落，農作物跌價的原因，除了孫院長的（質）的問題以外，其中實尤有最顯著的二種原因：</p>
<p>一，市塲擴大　此項原因，是和洋米徵稅有直接闗係的。原來我國對於糧食素不徵稅，因此食糧之輸入，年有加多之趨向。沿通商口岸一帶的地方，採辦洋米。不必說了，就是鄉村上，也是採辦洋米的。從前的市場是以一縣爲單位，例如本年豐收，則就是所謂大有年了，歉收才是農村破產的現象。所以農作物的價络，隨收成及供求闗係而增减，無特殊的變異。而今則是市塲擴大了，年成不好，農村經濟固然要破產，就是豐收，農民也是不能夠富裕的。因爲農作物的價格，已須視洋米洋麥爲上下。國内的農作物，數量小，是不能影響於價格的。從前的市塲是一地方一縣一省，而今則擴大至全世界。洋米的價格賤，國内農作物的價格就不得不隨之而低下，所以就這一項原因言，如果能夠限制洋米進口，或者使洋米價格漲上，使國内農作物的價格提高，同時使洋米不致影響及國内農作物之市價，則洋米徵稅，是有利的。</p>
<p>二，交通阻礙　洋米所以充斥之第二原因，由於本國交通的不便，甲省米太多了，乙省反感不足，甲省的米不能到乙省來，乙省也不能想甲省的接濟，所以兩省都感到困苦。就在孫院長的談話中找事實，他說：粤桂各地米商，多向安南及暹羅定米，而不向國内，此項現狀，就由於交通不發達之故。試想國内辦米，還不如國外來得便宜，所以甲省感到缺米，等國内的接濟到時，早已不及，就使運到，其市塲也早爲洋米捷足先登了。從這一着看，國内米荒，固待於洋米之接濟，就是豐年，也還待洋米之接濟。國内運輸不方便，造成農作物分配不平均的現狀，因而造成洋米之傾銷與獨占，所以洋米之傾銷，不憂於其本身之傾銷，而憂在於國内之需要這種傾銷，這種傾銷狀態釀成的結果，使農作物跌價，農民厭棄職業，農田荒蕪而瀕於破產。挽救的方法，固在使國内的米來代替洋米的地位，在原則上也是有利的　　三</p>
<p>但在事實上論，就有務碍的地方，闗於　稅問題之持反對論者，尙未間有緩行之建　。建議者爲汕頭財政廳之一電，電内說：徽洋米進口稅，市民商會，均　　萬狀，電　取銷，以恤災黎。（十八日申報）這恐怕也是事實，電内雖没有說明理由，但從現在農村狀况，覺得是對的，而有可採討之處二：</p>
<p>其一：國内的米麥，究竟自給夠不夠？我國是以農立國的國家，又是土地大，農民多，應該說自給是足夠的，但從事實上調查，恐怕不見得如此，有的農民是在土匪蹂躪之下的，有的是預徵農稅至十多年的，有的是在水災旱區之下過生活的，有的是遭着兵燹未復的，再有的是靠種烟過活的，恐怕可以種米麥的就不甚多。平素在這畸形狀態之下，就靠着米來苟延殘喘，農村人民一面農作物之生產者，同時又爲消費者。如果國内的米麥自給還不够，一面又因洋米徵稅而昻貴，豈不是陷全國糧食界於恐慌地位？同時恐怕食糧要漲，農村裡的消費者，也要受重大的影響了。</p>
<p>其二：國内的米自給夠了，能否分配平均？就使國内的糧食自給有餘，其主要的問題還在能否分配平均。如果不能，也還是不能挽救農村經濟之破產。在上面說過；洋米之傾銷，不在憂於其本身之傾銷，而憂在於國内之需要這種傾銷，當這一省感受荒年之時，正待於米糧之接濟，洋米的來源如果比國產米來得快，當然可以比較有效一些。但那時候因爲洋米已有進口稅，比較進口困難，是否將使荒區不但感到米荒，還受壟斷之苦？就在汕頭商會一電中，述及困難狀况，多半也因爲那面的運輸比較以洋米爲便捷，一經徵稅，國内的米不能接濟，洋米倒反漲高，是無異自蹈絶境。所以在這一項言，如果交通不能發達，則卽使能阻止洋米之傾銷，仍不能補救危狀於萬一。</p>
<p>本文的立論，似乎是反對徵稅的，而其實不是，洋米獨覇國内，代替國產米麥的地位，大量生產和大量傾銷，就使國内農業立刻復興，不徵洋米稅，恐怕未必能說奪回，所以洋米不徵稅，足使國内農村日趨没落，不過在徵收洋米稅實行之先，我们希望要同時注意兩點；　　在耕種方法上，須加以改進，别人是新式的生產，而我们則仍是純用人力，一遇天災，就束手無法，應研究怎樣使農產物生產可以加多，在交通方面，尤希望當局能夠籌妥善辦法，應研究怎樣使米麥可以流行無阻，如此，則國内農產狀况改進後，一面限制洋米進口，一面又使國内農作物流行無阻，則洋米的地位自然趨於失敗的。</p>
<p>所以在救濟農村立場上觀察洋米徵稅，覺得在或種狀態之下是有商議可能，甚至足爲農村之害，而其原則當然是必須行的。</p>
<h3>洋米徵稅之善後如何？</h3>
<p>— 曹文海</p>
<p>商，趁未徵稅之前，紛運洋米赴省，以便居奇；及聞徵稅，而米價　漲元許，是農民未蒙救濟之益，食米已有貴價之痛，蒙其利者旣爲米商，而米商猶在反對，此則營業之闗係也。</p>
<p>夫洋米徵稅，無所用其反對，蓋徵收洋米之進口稅，卽提高本國糧價，謀農民之福利。但如米穀過剩，卽無洋米進口，而價仍不振，維持米價，以惠農民，似又非徵稅所能解决矣。何况我國缺米，已爲常事，不乘有餘之時，稍事積儲，必至缺乏之時，仰乞於人。本年日本米價下跌，農民困苦，高橋是清力倡米穀國防政策，以備有事之用，日政府亦預備米價跌至某種程度時，出而收買，以資維持，此何其籌謀之深也。</p>

<h3>抄近路　之</h3>
<p>（抄近路），是聰明人表示敏捷的行動的一句術語，換句話說，（抄近路）就是（走捷徑）。會抄近路的先生们，他無論做起甚麽事來，可以不必脚踏實地，按步就班，循規蹈規的笨幹，他可以在半空中架起梯子來，很快的爬上青雲去。因爲（笨幹）固然吃力，亦且不見得就會討好，或是必定獲利，所以（笨幹）是不出息的傻子们的事，我们不屑去講它，而我们的靈巧每捷的聰明人是絶對不會如此没腦經不會想的。比如說呢：在學校裹，聰明的，他儘可以從二年級的上學期，轉一個聰明小灣灣，便能一下子爬到三年級的下學期：小學畢業也有直接踏進高貴的學術之府大學之門的可能丨横直没有修讀過的課程，總不過是這麽一回事，好在（大家都是中國人）好說話而大概是没有問題的。在社會上，也是同一樣的，無論經商或是做官，像由學徒而直接升做掌櫃，小科員而摇身變成部長要人之類的大快人意的幸福事，總是要會抄近路的先生们才幹得出來。再說那低賤卑下層的吧，即如每天在街道上過馬路生活的黄包車夫，假使他能敏捷的在避免巡捕警棍混飛亂舞之下的地方，靈巧地矯健地大轉其小轉灣兒，或是抄一條不爲人知的小路，他便可以讓他的賤價的腿少幌動幾下子，不值錢的氣也得少喘幾口，當然幾個銅子兒也可以早些時從僱客肥大的肚包裹飛滾到他粗　乾燥的手心裹來。所以，在這裹，我们便能恍然的知道了：會而且能（抄近路）的先生们，不但不必像　子们樣痴長着頭頸没有出息的笨幹，而且往往總是沾着便宜，又是便宜先沾！……這些事，才眞夠羨煞傻子们丨這些道理，才眞非傻子们做夢所會想得到的呢丨</p>
<p>但，一般的說，在世界上，咱们中國人總算是會而且能（抄近路）的民族。有一次，一個外國朋友告訴我：（今日可說是物質文明發達到了極端的時候了，可是這文明是經了我们（當然是他们囉丨丨之·）長時期的研究，發明和改進而成的，其間（眞不知花費了多少精神，時間和錢財丨而聰明的幸運的你们中國人可以不消動手便得坐着享受。比如說汽車吧，我们（又是一個我们丨丨之。）是從獨輪的手推車逐漸逐漸一步一步地，經過了無數次的艱辛的改革和演變，最後才能達到了今日的所謂（一九三三）最新式的一種！而你们中國人呢，便有從坐十八世紀的農村山谷裹的粗木製的獨輪小車而一躍便能坐這經過千辛萬苦艱難締造成的（一九三三）最新式的一種汽車的福氣丨……其他如敎育，社會組織和制度等等都是同一方式的。）這個外國朋友說話未免太尖毒了些，然而由這一點不能磨滅的事實証之，咱们該得承認中國人是個善於（抄近路）的民族丨</p>
<p>（抄近路）究竟是正當不正嘗，大概事實總會給我们以正確的答覆和敎訓的，這裹無須我们來多說。不過，在我们眼面前所演過去的，不少的聰明人都得當的利用了（抄近路）這一術語，而在這個社會裹暫時鬼混得了相當的便益，所以很多的可憐最看得　紅紅的也躍躍欲試地想來玩他一套，可是不得這秘密的門徑，亦没有那寛闊的道路。所以，在這裹，我是功德無量地自動地把這（抄近路）的秘密宣示　生：曰！</p>
<p>（運　……吹……拍……拍賣自身和同伴的利益而巳矣。</p>

<h3>一頁黑暗家庭的慘史　警愚</h3>
<p>老實說一句，在這僻處海濱而小若彈丸的Ｓ鎭上，總要讓還李姓，算是一個有名的大族；而李姓　族當中，要算四老爺是一位首屈一指的財主；</p>
<p>唯其是有銅鈿的財主，所以四老爺夫婦，終日就嘯傲於烟霞窟裹，吐霧呑雲，過着優哉游哉的歳月。</p>
<p>四老爺夫婦的年紀，在（不惑）與（知命）間。膝前祇有一子一女，女未字人，子則年才（弱冠；）爲欲早了（向平）起見，就在半載以前，給它成了家室：娶的自然也是門當户對的有錢人家的女子，妝奩之富麗，實爲合邑巨室所僅見，很大的裹外兩個房間，還嫌不夠陳列，其多也就可想而知了！</p>
<p>娶了這樣一房兒媳，在理自應特别重視，刮目相看，然而四老爺夫婦則不然。四老爺比較倒還好些，唯獨四太太竟把她恨深切骨，時加詬誶，簡直不當她是家屬的一員。</p>
<p>據說四太太也自有其毫無理性而自以爲是的理由；因爲在她兒子大好日的結婚當兒，桌上點的花燭，左邊的一支，無故瀉起油來，瞬即油盡熄滅。依她的迷信見解，以爲這是大獨霉頭丨而且照着男左女右的俗例來講，是應該應在她兒子身上的。爲了這個無意識的懷疑，遂疑心到新婦是個犯着尅夫的敗命，憎惡之念，不覺油然而萌：而一頁家庭的黑暗慘史，亦即於以開始。</p>
<p>三朝以后，四太太就呌兒子别居一室，不許和她接近，恐怕給這敗命帶累了的樣子。倘兩小喁喁私語，馬上板起面孔，大肆賣駡，誣她不懷好意，勾引男人：甚麽（爛污Ｘ）（怪妖精）……所有村婦駡街的各種穢褻名詞，都能像聯珠似的傾倒出來。</p>
<p>四太太的這位兒子，果然孝順，抱定（不抵抗）主義，一唯母命是從：可是心中不無怏怏。本來它的身體是異常羸弱，加以自怨自艾，已成骨立形銷丨最近乘着防範疏懈，居然潛赴閨中，與婦繾綣；詎爲乃母偵知，遽去搥門吆喝，因茲震恐，釀成（慾後受驚；）又復玩愒因循，不即醫治，等到勢如燎原，才思乞靈於藥石；顧此時縱有（盧）（扁）再生，亦已束手無策的了！</p>
<p>唯是四太太對於兒子之死，不怪自己不好，轉咎兒媳的不該把她兒子害死，頓足椎胸，大哭大駡！（爛污Ｘ）（怪妖精）……之外，又加了她一個（害人精）的罪名。而最稱豈有此理的。在她兒子入殮的時候，當着好多親友，歷訴她的怎樣害死了丈夫，有聲有色，幾於不堪入耳，聞者無弗掩口葫蘆，弄得這位（未亡人）的她，羞慚無地，有口難言；惟有躄踊嚎啕，至於暈絶！幸經衆人立施灌救，獲以甦醒過來。</p>
<p>後來得了她的胞兄ＸＸ，在四太太面前，推說家中母病垂危，要求挈同妹子遄歸省視，言之再三，復承諸親友之竭力婉勸，才能准如所請，勉放歸寗。於是這位焭焭寡鵠，得以暫離這黑暗家庭，跟了哥哥一淘回去；而此不忍卒讀的一頁慘史，也得告一段落。</p>
<h3>當自嘴巴說起　柯定</h3>
<p>說來也眞慚愧，都市中的中國人，一大半已經是浸沉在外洋化的深海裹了，你看他们穿的用的，可說是十分之七是外國貨，稍微月入大一些的人，他總是要住洋房，用洋貨，甚至吃的飲食品，也惟外貨是求，什麽酒咧，點心咧，菜咧……種種却都要去買來路貨，就以酒來說吧！一瓶白蘭地，外國貨要值六七兩銀子，一只外國貨的奶油蛋糕，最低價也得二三元，纔可以買到，還有外國貨的肴饌，價值也是至高至貴，我们學時髦的中國人，却棄了自己的精華來嘗人家的糟粕，這是如何不值得的事？　　所以中國人到了現在，還是個愛國愛不成功，這因爲是中國人的嘴巴大不爭氣了，你看上台說是：青年人應當愛國，第一件大事，就是大家提倡國貨……他在高聲演說之後，連忙走進番菜館，去喝他的葡萄酒，吃他的來路大菜，這樣的情形，你想：（愛國）二字，不是把他糟遢了嗎？所以我說：（當自嘴巴說起）要知道這句話的來由，且把下面所寫的，也附帶一讀：</p>
<p>（飲食是人的大欲）這是千古不易的金玉之言，但是飲食太隨便了就容易生病，飲食品物的檢擇太隨便了，就容易引起亡國之痛，這樣看來，與其隨便於飲食品的檢擇，還是隨便飲食的好，因爲飲食隨便而生病，不過是闗乎個人的生死，倘使把飲食品物隨便，那是足以亡國，這眞是罪大惡極了，所以在這個國貨年頭，且慢談别種的提倡國貨方法，先從嘴巴來提倡國貨，我想這不過是一個小小的舌尖問題，一定不會有什麽大問題，譬如今天要喝外國貨白蘭地的，要知我们中國貨也有很好的白蘭地，拿來代替代替，要吃來路貨的大菜，就吃吃我们中國貨很好的菜肴，要解渴想喝外國貨的汽水，中國貨也有很好的汽水，以及其他種種，要用到外國貨，就改用中國貨，這樣從嘴巴改起，嘴巴旣然純粹的國貨了，再來談服用國貨，那是無往而不順利了。</p>

<h3>Fang Ji and Others Plan a Three-Pronged Attack on Beiping, Ji Hongchang Has Arrived in Huairou, and Bandits in Luandong Have Also Been Colluding</h3>
<p>Mi Dexin's Troops Occupy Niulanshan, Shunyi Reports Emergency</p>
<p>Shi Yousan and Others Secretly Engage in Activities to Disrupt Tianjin and Gubei</p>
<p>Miyun Security Forces Disarmed by Japanese Army</p>
<p>Japanese Side States That the Kwantung Army Has No Connection with Fang</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our side raised three points to the Japanese side, advocating that Fang Zhenwu of Huairou should be suppressed by our side sending troops, but the Japanese side has not yet given a definite reply. Ji Hongchang also led his troops to Huairou yesterday afternoon to join forces with Fang's troops. Ji's troops are said to number 10,000, but in reality, there are only over 4,000 men, and less than half of them have guns. Regarding Fang's plans to cause disturbances, Ji Hongchang is in charge of the left column, Tang Yulin is in charge of the right column, and Fang Zhenwu is in the middle, acting as the vanguard. Tang plans to enter through Nankou, while Fang and Ji plan to break through the Changping-Yanqing line of the truce agreement and head straight for Beiping. Lao Haozi (Old Mouse) in Luandong, Shi Yousan, and a certain unit recently incorporated have secretly colluded with Fang, Tang, and others, plotting to disrupt Tianjin and Gubei, advancing on three fronts, hoping to realize their so-called North China State conspiracy. If things fail, they will flee to the Luanyu area and, under certain cover, reorganize and plan a major offensive. Shi Yousan is currently in Tianjin actively engaging in activities, and is also buying off hooligans in Beiping and Tianjin, plotting to disrupt the rear. Regarding the Japanese side's warning to Fang to withdraw from the demilitarized zone within a time limit, what method the Japanese side will take to resolve the issue when the deadline arrives is noteworthy. It is reported that yesterday afternoon, the oral army suddenly arrived in Miyun and disarmed all of our country's security forces and police stationed in the county. All guns and uniforms were temporarily taken by a certain party. According to a certain military officer, they cannot be returned until the Fang incident is resolved. What their intentions are is unfathomable. Currently, Fang, Ji, and others are entrenched in Huairou, actively requisitioning provisions and cash, preparing to move out. The Beiping authorities are paying close attention to this. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Gaoliying states that Ji Hongchang, Rong Sandian Zhantao, and other troops entered Hebei Province on the 22nd via two routes, the Hekoukou Dashilue, which is 30 miles north of Huairou. Ji Zhantao arrived in Huairou County early on the 23rd and immediately entered the city to meet Fang. More than 1,000 men from the Zhantao unit successively arrived outside Huairou City. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding our side's issue with Fang, Yin Tong was previously dispatched to negotiate with Chaisan, still advocating that our side send troops to suppress them. Based on the results of the talks, Chaisan telegraphed the Kwantung Army for instructions. A reply telegram arrived in Beiping today. This afternoon, Chaisan visited Yin and conveyed the Kwantung Army's reply telegram. Regarding Fang's actions, if he does not retreat, the Kwantung Army will still take decisive measures to suppress him, and stated that the Kwantung Army has absolutely no connection with Fang. Our side still insists on resolving the Fang issue by sending our own troops. Chaisan will pay a visit to He tonight to continue negotiations. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Niulanshan is Occupied by Fang's Troops, Public Security Bureau Personnel Retreat to Shunyi County</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military news: A telephone call from County Magistrate Su of Shunyi County states that yesterday afternoon, the Fourth Army Commander of Fang's troops, Mi Dexin's troops, occupied Niulanshan, with about 1,500 to 1,600 men. Only half of them have guns, and their clothes are tattered. They are extorting supplies from merchants, and the merchants cannot bear the harassment, and most of them have fled. The public security bureau personnel originally stationed there, due to the disparity in numbers, have all retreated to Shunyi County. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Someone from Huairou talked about how Fang's army is arbitrarily looting in Huairou City. All men around the age of twenty are forced to join the army as soldiers. Now the Chamber of Commerce and various agencies are required to pay 30,000 yuan within three days. They are deliberately spreading their soldiers all over the area to show off their power and strictly guard the city gates. At Fengshankou, 12 miles from Huairou, and Qiaozicun, 15 miles away, Fang's army has built battle trenches and sent troops to guard them. Traveling from Beiping, this is the end point. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Security Forces Stationed in Miyun Surrender Their Weapons, the Disarmed Weapons are Preserved by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) When Fang's troops entered Huairou from Hefangkou in Miyun, passing through Wulidian, County Magistrate Sun Shutang of Miyun inquired about the truth from the Japanese army stationed in Miyun by telephone, but did not receive a definite reply. The Japanese side also disarmed the security forces stationed in Miyun, and the disarmed weapons are preserved by the Japanese army. As a result, Fang's troops advanced towards Huairou. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Fang and Ji troops who sneaked into Huairou have been continuously followed by large numbers from Dashiluekou, crossing the Great Wall in succession in recent days. On the 22nd, about 2,000 cavalrymen from Fang's troops continued to arrive and were stationed in the Fenzhuang area. On the 23rd, more than 4,000 cavalrymen from Ji's troops sneaked from Dashiyukou to Miyun. The first and second districts of Hexi were all occupied and stationed. Ji has arrived in Huairou and met with Fang. Ji's soldiers are poorly dressed and their guns are incomplete. After arriving, they extorted supplies and fodder from the local area. Because Hedong is the county seat of Miyun, and the headquarters of the Japanese army brigade is located in the city, Ji's army did not cross the river to enter the city. The number of Japanese troops in the city has increased compared to before, and they are scattered on the city walls day and night to patrol. The 120-member security team was completely disarmed by the Japanese military police headquarters yesterday. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Fang Plans to Send Plainclothes Teams to Disturb Beiping, Sneaking into the City to Disrupt the Rear</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shunyi states that after Huairou was occupied by Fang's troops this time, the 132-member Sixth Security Company in the city was completely disarmed by Fang's troops. A total of more than 70 rifles, 7 machine guns, and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition were confiscated. It is rumored that Fang plans to send more than 700 plainclothes teams to sneak into Beiping City, plotting to disrupt public order. If the plainclothes teams enter Beiping, Fang's troops will attack from Niulanshan. County Magistrate Su of the county has telegraphed the Beiping authorities, requesting strict precautions. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side previously warned Fang to withdraw from Huairou on the 26th. The leaflets stating that if they do not withdraw completely by the 27th, they will be suppressed are only distributed in Beiping. They have not been seen in Shunyi and Huairou. In the past two days, not only has Fang's troops not made any preparations to withdraw, but Ji's troops have also entered. This kind of trick will be clear within a few days. They have also sent plainclothes teams to sneak into Beiping to cause disturbances. The 26th and 27th of this month will be a critical period. The authorities have taken strict precautions against this. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Beiping City Tightens Security, Public Security Bureau to Conduct Census of the City</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief, fearing that villains will take the opportunity to disrupt public order due to the unrest in northern Beiping, has ordered the district offices to tighten security starting today, and ordered them to pay attention to pedestrians entering and leaving the city gates and mixed-residence areas, and to conduct a census of the city within a specific period. According to a certain source, Huang Fu will return to Beiping this month. It is heard that the handover of the new and old Public Security Bureau Chiefs in Beiping City can also be resolved before Huang arrives in Beiping. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>More Than a Thousand Troops of Ji Arrive at Fuma Village</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Gaoliying states that more than a thousand troops of Ji Hongchang sneaked south from the Dashilue area the day before yesterday and arrived at Fuma Village north of Huairou yesterday. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Bandit Troops Outside the Pass Will Also Enter</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Several thousand bandit troops outside the pass have also colluded with Fang and Ji and will enter the Guandong area inside the pass to join the activities. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Huairou Security Team Leader Flees to Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Shiying, the original security team stationed in Huairou City, was trapped in the city after the incident. Fang lured and threatened him, and the team leader reluctantly complied. He has now taken the opportunity to flee to Beiping. The report about him becoming Fang's brigade commander is inaccurate. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>There is No Need to Separately Draft a Law for Punishing Traitors</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan of the Central Political Council Reviews the Results</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters submitted a request to the Central Government to formulate an emergency law for punishing traitors and unscrupulous merchants. After reviewing the results, the Legislative Yuan of the Central Political Council believed that the request was necessary. However, the "Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China," the "Criminal Law," and the "Military Secret Protection Law" already have regulations on punishing traitors, so there is no need to separately draft a law. An order has been issued to inform them accordingly. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Security Police to Proceed to Luandong to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Departing in Batches from Tianjin Today</p>
<h3>Bandits Have Sufficient Ammunition and Strict Organization, Replenishment is in Place, and They Will Besiege Funing Again</h3>
<p>Strategically Advancing on Towns and Cities, Attempting to Create Another Situation</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two thousand security police will depart in batches from Tianjin tomorrow to suppress bandits in Luandong. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Changli This time, the Luandong bandits strategically attacked cities and towns. The primary goal is to occupy Funing and Changli, using these two counties as a base and gradually advancing, attempting to create another situation. Guo Yazhou, who claims to be the commander of the First Army of the East Asia Alliance United Army, and Li Guangbo, the deputy commander, have 1,500 men. Zhang Kuiyuan, the commander of the Second Army, and Zhang Huating, the deputy commander, have 2,500 men. In addition, there is Da Wulong, with about 500 men, plus other small groups, totaling more than 5,000 men. They have 5 or 6 mortars, 2 or 3 field guns, 2 or 3 flat-firing guns, and about 2,000 rifles. The flag style is five colors on the left corner and the rest is red, which is different from the flag of the puppet state. The organization is quite strict, and the ammunition is sufficient, which is different from ordinary bandits. Since pressing on Funing on the 21st, they occupied Zijin Mountain, three miles south of the city, on the same night, and fired cannons very accurately from above. The county government was destroyed, and many city walls were also destroyed. Two or three police officers were injured. County Magistrate Liu immediately telegraphed Changli for help. Dou, the head of the Changli security team, reported this and telegraphed the province for instructions. At the same time, as a delaying tactic, he first ordered County Magistrate Liu to find a way to deal with it, so that troops could be sent to their aid. Liu's battalion commander, who was in Tangshan at this time, had been ordered to head east, arriving near Funing late on the 22nd. If they had arrived a few hours later, Funing would have been unimaginable. After Liu's team arrived, they joined forces with Wu's battalion commander in Funing to launch a joint attack. At the same time, a part of the troops forced the bandits' right wing. In the afternoon, Wu's team recovered Zijin Mountain, and the siege of Funing was lifted. The bandit troops scattered in all directions, some north to Taitouying and Yiyuan Pass, some south to Changli, west to Lulong, and east to Yuguan Town. Changli, upon receiving the report, rushed a part of its troops to Liushouying to intercept them. As of the evening of the 23rd, Shijingshan, east of Funing, was also recaptured. In this battle, squad leader Wang Baohe was killed in action, and company commander Zhang was injured. Four or five officers and police were injured. The bandits suffered heavier casualties. Most of them continued to advance east, directly pressing on Yuguan Town. Currently, most of the bandits are concentrated in Yuguan Town, some have fled east to Lulong, and some are north of Liushouying, but they cannot enter the territory of Linyu County. According to reports, on the 23rd, 30 to 40 cars, fully loaded with military supplies, drove to Yuguan Town to replenish the bandit troops. The source is unknown. As a result, the bandits' momentum has been restored and there is a tendency to make a comeback. On the evening of the 24th, they will besiege Funing again. Battalion Commander Dou has been at the front line for days, personally supervising the suppression due to the rampant banditry. On the 24th, when visiting Dou, he said that as a result of the continuous attacks from Funing these days, he has rescued more than 20 hostages and 4 or 5 women. The bandit troops are now burning and killing everywhere, and their power is irresistible. Judging from the current situation, it is feared that these bandits will be difficult to fundamentally resolve in the short term. However, this headquarters is determined to be shattered jade rather than a complete tile, and will do its best to suppress them. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Dai Ji in Beiping Suffers from a Cold and Enters the Hospital</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Dai Ji, the Civil Affairs Director of the Fujian Provincial Government, arrived in Beiping a few days ago and is now hospitalized in the Central Hospital due to illness. When reporters visited on the afternoon of the 24th, he said that he came north for sightseeing and is now receiving treatment in the hospital for a slight cold. After recovering, he plans to take a trip on the Beiping-Hankou Railway. Whether he will take up the position of Civil Affairs Director of Fujian is still undecided. There are indeed quite a few communists in northern Fujian, but Yanping has not fallen. Cai Tingkai has moved to Yanping to command and will soon be able to eliminate them.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Another Perspective on the Government Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>Du</p>
<p>Our nation's financial sector is facing complete exhaustion. At this crucial time for disaster relief and bandit suppression, it almost universally reveals a fear of struggling to make ends meet. As a result, the calls for a government reduction movement have gained considerable momentum. The Shandong Provincial Government resolved to reduce assistance to disaster relief first, and Chairman Jiang issued a general order to cut and merge superfluous branches later. Recently, the Ministry of Finance, in the process of unifying taxation in North China, will also start with government reduction as a way to reorganize, saving unnecessary expenditures and seeking effective infusions. We are happy to express our full sympathy for this. Is there any room for hesitation?</p>
<p>The overlapping and superfluous political organs in our country, and the redundant and floating public officials, are far more out of line with the needs than ordinary people can imagine. The establishment of each new organ is mostly to create positions for people, not based on local conditions. The number of personnel is several times the amount of work. There are those who receive salaries but do not take office, and those who take office but do not handle affairs. Over time, it has become a habit. The problem of linked chickens has been formed, and the problem of triviality cannot be reformed. Take a look at the names of various government offices. There are so many institutions that it is really unknown how many are nominally in place. The huge annual expenditures are even more unknown how many parts are equal to waste. In today's tight situation, can we still allow unnecessary exploitation? It's like a wealthy family that raises many scholars. In peacetime, spending money like water is fine, with three thousand guests. Unfortunately, the family has declined, and the disease is getting worse. Suspicions and bizarre phenomena are all around, but the diners still want to cut off the resources for medicine and prepare for the needs of the public. Will the owner sit back and do nothing, or will he resolutely take measures to tighten the belt?</p>
<p>Perhaps some think that after the implementation of government reduction, it is indeed a good plan to save money. But if the institutions that have been established in the past are suddenly abolished, and the redundant personnel who have been listed in the past are abruptly eliminated, will there be any concerns about the inflexibility of administrative facilities or improper adjustments? Then the direct answer should be: Absolutely not. The superfluous branches are inherently parasitic and are not where actual government orders come from. The redundant personnel are mostly occupying positions and accomplishing nothing, and there is no administrative efficiency to speak of. There is no need to worry about any slight impact after abolishing them. On the other hand, although the superfluous branches themselves have no achievements, public documents often have to pass through their hands. The redundant personnel are not solely responsible, and when documents are numerous, they will inevitably shirk their responsibilities. Because of the shirk, public affairs often tend to accumulate. Because of the multiple transmissions, government orders are increasingly delayed in their implementation. Is not Premier Wang's "imprisonment of public affairs," which he cited as a source of pain, often created by too many superfluous branches and redundant personnel? Not only that, but these people have long been idle and often feel monotonous. In addition to being well-fed, they have not tried to emerge from the ranks as a rising force. As a result, there are those who pick on public affairs and are good at supervising mistakes, and there are those who arbitrarily change things and are capricious. If this kind of action only ends with boredom, it will not be criticized by the people. But its influence often is not enough to benefit the country, but there is more than enough to disturb the people. The skills of the monkey trainer make people exhausted. They do not plan for the big picture, but strive for trivial details. All of this is caused by too many redundant personnel. Therefore, from a passive point of view, government reduction cannot harm the public, and from an active point of view, government reduction is beneficial to people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Others may think that after a large number of redundant personnel are laid off, there will be a new batch of unemployed people in society. This statement seems to be true, but it is not entirely accurate. The so-called redundant personnel are not all incapable of supporting themselves. It is just that in a certain environment, there is no need for them, and they become surplus products. In terms of qualifications, many are excellent. In terms of talent, they can also be effective. It is only because they admire the generous salaries and the prominent status in officialdom that they want to rely on attachment and sit back and reap the rewards. Because of this erroneous thought, I don't know how many promising young people have been ruined, and how much sluggish and unmotivated laziness has been cultivated. Adding a group of idle class in the officialdom is equivalent to reducing a point of productive force in society. Isn't it painful to talk about it? Today, we can vigorously implement government reduction. On the one hand, we can force those who have been infected with official infatuation to return to society and seek practical work. On the other hand, we can also remind those who dream of reversing and return early, and cut off their unrealistic thoughts. Then, it is directly seeking to tighten the machine, and indirectly is to promote the health of society.</p>
<p>Taking these aspects into consideration, government reduction has the effect of regulating the national treasury, can improve administrative efficiency, can promote the improvement of people's strength, and can shift the atmosphere of competition. All political organs in the country should carefully consider this and implement it vigorously. There is no need to look back.</p>

<p>The Situation on the Chinese Eastern Railway Deteriorates, Russia and Japan are at Daggers Drawn</p>
<p>Japan Instigates Puppets to Arrest Russian Railway Workers, Russian Newspaper Exposes Japan's Major Conspiracy</p>
<p>(Harbin) "The Chinese Eastern Railway is difficult to operate due to the activities of saboteurs. If immediate remedies are not taken, the railway will go bankrupt." This is what the inspector of the Chinese Eastern Railway reported to Changchun. Today's official statement outlined the main points of this report, stating that the prosecutor, after careful consideration, felt that the development of the railway was subject to the administrative sovereignty of (Manchukuo). Therefore, four important Russian officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway were summoned to inquire about everything. The four were Garina, Director of the Transportation Department, Rafurov, Director of the Plant, Kubili, Director of Accounting, and Abairov, Director of the Business Department. They were summoned to the Procuratorate at 6:00 a.m. this morning, and interrogated by the prosecutor at 9:00 a.m., and their residences were also searched. Shortly after, Nakamura, the Japanese police chief of Ruerbin, published an article to reporters, stating that the (Manchukuo) authorities' actions were purely judicial in nature and had no political meaning. The authorities will continue to take all necessary measures to eliminate dangerous and unstable elements to ensure the smooth operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Russian Consul General Slavsky went to see Diplomatic Officer Shi Liben in the afternoon to lodge a serious protest against the detention of four Russian railway officials, accusing the (Manchukuo) authorities of acting illegally and demanding the immediate release of the detainees. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to news from Boli, in its consistent strategy of reducing the economic position of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Japanese and Manchu authorities have used the following methods to achieve this: they do not pay a penny for the transportation of Japanese troops on the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to normal railway freight rates, the unpaid amount has reached 30 million Japanese yen. Although the Chinese Eastern Railway agreed to reduce the normal military freight rate at the request of the Japanese authorities, the issue was ultimately delayed by the Japanese military authorities. Their arrears to the railway have not been paid either. The news also stated that, at the same time as this behavior, the Japanese adviser to the (Manchukuo) Ministry of Communications claimed that the Chinese Eastern Railway had become an unprofitable enterprise. (23rd TASS Telegram)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Uses Strong Language</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government newspaper (Izvestia) today exposed the plan of the (Manchukuo) authorities, under the instigation of the Japanese, to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway in a strongly worded editorial. The newspaper reiterated the statement that the Japanese government alone is responsible for the conspiracy regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway issue in Manchuria, and that this conspiracy is completely contrary to all official statements of the Japanese government and violates its own obligations. What the Soviet government expects from the Japanese government is to abide by its obligations and immediately stop all actions that forcibly change the status quo of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In this article entitled (Exposure of the Usurper and Warning to its Instigators), it is stated that, according to reliable reports from the Soviet government, the Japanese and Manchu authorities plan to</p>
<h3>Seize the Eastern Railway Plan</h3>
<p>The implementation of the plan to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway will begin with the arrest of the Soviet employees in charge of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They are accused of following the orders of the director of the railway administration, which are against the wishes of the Japanese and Manchu authorities. After the arrest, they plan to appoint the current Manchu deputy director, who is an assistant to the Soviet director, as the Manchu director of the railway. At the same time, the current director shall not issue any orders without his consent. The realization of these steps is a clear violation of existing agreements and treaties, and it is also clear evidence of the Japanese and Manchu authorities forcibly seizing the railway. This plan was drafted when the (Manchukuo) delegation was in Tokyo discussing the</p>
<h3>Delaying Tokyo Negotiations</h3>
<p>While ostensibly claiming that they will use peaceful means to resolve the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, this proves that the strategy of the Manchu delegation is to delay the negotiations and eliminate all possibilities for a satisfactory solution. Thus, they are calmly preparing to forcibly seize the Chinese Eastern Railway at an opportune moment. At the same time, the planning of this violent plan to seize the railway coincides with the Chinese Eastern Railway management conference being held in Harbin between the Soviet and Manchu sides to discuss various important issues. This proves that what the Japanese and Manchu authorities are hoping for is not business cooperation with the Soviet administrative departments, but to eliminate them and deprive them of all their legitimate rights. The statements made by Ke Nikov in Moscow and Yu Lie Nev in Tokyo have exposed their hypocritical strategies, their violation of treaties, their disregard for their own obligations, and their secret preparations for usurping the railway. This statement rightly accuses</p>
<h3>Japan Should Bear Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>The Japanese government (not the powerless Manchukuo) should bear full responsibility for this situation. The Soviet Union fully understands that the Manchu authorities are by no means the true masters of Manchuria. Supervision of all administrative, economic, military, and political issues is in the hands of the Japanese government and representatives of the Japanese military. The actual power is in the hands of the Japanese authorities. The Manchu authorities do not dare to step beyond the bounds without the permission of their Japanese protectors. This is very obvious. Therefore, when the Manchu authorities are preparing to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union naturally believes that their actions in this incident are instructed by the Japanese government. Therefore, all responsibility for destroying the interests of the Soviet Union in this railway should be borne by the Japanese government. When negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway began, the Soviet government deeply considered the repeated announcements and guarantees made by the Japanese government that it was willing to assist both sides in reaching a peaceful resolution to the issue of the fate of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The fact that these negotiations were held in Tokyo is sufficient to indicate that the Japanese government has indeed fulfilled some of its tasks and</p>
<h3>Hirota's Guarantee is Unreliable</h3>
<p>Obligations. Until recently, Hirota reiterated his guarantee that Japanese foreign policy would strive to maintain peaceful relations with the Soviet Union. However, the information received by the Soviet government does not confirm Hirota's guarantee. On the contrary, this information is completely contrary to it. After the Japanese government had introduced its troops into Manchuria, it made a firm guarantee to the Soviet government that Soviet interests would not be lost in any way. It is unknown how the unprecedented destruction of the Chinese Eastern Railway that is currently being prepared is consistent with these guarantees. The Soviet government firmly demands that the Japanese government fulfill its obligations, fully respect the rights and interests of the Soviet Union, and immediately stop all actions that forcibly change the status quo of the Chinese Eastern Railway.

<h3>Mussolini Writes in Support of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Aiding its Break from Isolation</p>
<p>(Paris) The Economic and Financial Communications newspaper will publish an article by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini tomorrow entitled (Italy and Russia), which states that Italy is willing to join hands with other countries, regardless of their political system, without any contradiction. This is the best way to build peace. (As for Russia, I firmly believe that we should help it break away from its isolated position and seek closer cooperation with the Western powers to benefit culture and promote peace.) Mussolini went on to say that Russia has a vast territory and a population of 164 million that cannot be ignored. If we recognize Russia's rights, we can achieve two results: (1) establish Russia's position in international organizations, and (2) ensure that Western countries do not attempt to isolate Russia. Mussolini also said that (apart from ordinary friendship, especially the basis of economic cooperation), there is no special point of political contact between Italy and Russia. Mussolini went on to talk about the Russian political system, saying that (in terms of political environment, we are very far from Russia, but this theory is only related to internal affairs. Italy does not intend to interfere, nor will it ever interfere.) Regarding the Italian-Soviet non-aggression treaty, Mussolini believes that this treaty occupies a position in Eastern European politics that is no different from the Four-Power Pact in Western Europe. The conclusion is that (on September 2, the day the Italian-Soviet non-aggression treaty was signed, a very large part of Europe became politically stable, and the situation in Eastern Europe also calmed down. It is hoped that the Western European countries will take further final steps in this direction in future international conferences.) (24th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Roosevelt Plans to Expand Credit Lending</p>
<h3>Aiming to Promote Economic Conditions and Reduce the Power of Extreme Inflationists</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US President will decide on a grand inflationary credit plan within the next week. This includes purchasing preferred shares of banks, enabling the re-circulation of $200,000,000 of deposited funds stranded in banks, expanding the scope of loans for industries, especially providing loans to farmers holding cotton, etc. The purpose is solely to promote economic conditions and reduce the power of extreme inflationists, so that the Thomas faction, which currently holds the upper hand, will no longer be a problem for the government after Congress reconvenes next year. Although major bankers do not strongly support the government's plan to purchase preferred shares to bail out stranded bank deposits, believing that robust banks do not need to increase capital and that purchasing stocks of weak banks is not the best policy, and that expanding credit and loans should wait until the industrial recovery, it is still considered better than the substantive monetary inflation proposed by the extreme inflationists. The US President will convene the heads of agricultural and financial departments early next week to discuss this matter. Even while on a yacht trip today, the President is still drafting this plan and considering the proposal to purchase large quantities of stored cotton and 15,000,000 tons of stored coal to provide relief to the unemployed this winter. In addition, there are plans to provide cash loans to farmers with stored cotton, at a rate of one dime per pound. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas, the leader of the extreme monetary inflation faction, stated today that he is changing his monetary inflation proposal, advocating the simplest method of controlled inflation: the President issuing interest-free Treasury bonds, which can be redeemed at any time with long-term public bonds, to control the degree of monetary inflation. He also said that he inquired about the attitudes of various senators, and 75% in the Senate and 96% in the House of Representatives support reasonable monetary inflation. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) A crucial meeting will be held at the White House tonight. President Roosevelt will discuss with Treasury Secretary Woodin, Federal Reserve Director Black, and other experts the monetary and financial policies the government should adopt. A government official denied that the government is currently considering issuing bank notes backed by government bonds to expand the currency supply. According to rumors, the government wanted to issue $200,000,000 in banknotes so that the $200,000,000 in deposits stuck in closed and restricted banks could be released. However, according to the official's statement, this rumor is unfounded. The official also stated that the Federal Reserve Bank does not want to buy more government bonds in the open market than it currently holds, but rather encourages banks to lend more to the industrial sector. This action will inevitably cause great disappointment, it is said. The Federal Reserve Board has recently been buying government bonds at a rate of approximately $35,000,000 per week, aiming to increase the reserves available to commercial banks for lending. However, banks are unwilling to lend cash to the industrial sector because there are few sound borrowers. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt will convene government officials and economic experts tonight to discuss a plan to infuse substantial capital into various major US industries to revitalize them. The government's intention regarding monetary inflation policy is wavering. Economic advisor Mr. White, who drafted the aforementioned plan, has repeatedly urged President Roosevelt not to hesitate any longer on this matter. Mr. White plans to issue $100,000,000 in new paper money, but after the issuance, all monetary inflation measures will cease. Another matter under consideration in Mr. White's plan is how to make the frozen deposits in already-closed banks re-circulate. Some advocate issuing new banknotes to repay depositors, while the conservative faction supports the Financial Reconstruction Finance Corporation purchasing the preferred shares of these banks to acquire their assets. President Roosevelt is well aware that immediate action is necessary. It is generally believed that he has not yet made any decisions at present, but the proposal to issue new paper money is unlikely to be considered by Roosevelt. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Plans to Stabilize Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Issuing Banknotes Based on Gold Reserves</p>
<p>(Washington) News from Ottawa reports that Canadian Prime Minister Bennett is planning to stabilize the Canadian gold standard by issuing banknotes based on Canada's existing gold reserves. This would have a moderate inflationary effect but is offset by the benefit of stabilizing the currency's value. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Cuban Unrest Intensifies, Factional Strife Moves to the Capital, British and American Factory Workers Trapped</h3>
<p>Havana Except for the province of Antilla, all other Cuban provinces are peaceful. However, factional strife has moved to the capital. Although the factions of former President Menocal and Mendieta have withdrawn their public opposition to the government's plan, it is rumored that military leaders are dissatisfied because the government has failed to provide adequate supplies as scheduled. Colonel Batista has also broken with the students, declaring that he will no longer seek the opinions of student representatives. This is said to be because a few leaders of the student opposition faction held a meeting without first consulting Batista. As for the unrest in Antilla, it is reported that workers have seized the American-owned sugar factory in Tanamo, effectively imprisoning eight British and American factory workers. The workers at the factory are extremely arrogant. A US warship has assisted three women and five children in boarding the ship. (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Havana Sixteen British and American staff, along with their wives, are currently trapped in their homes by striking workers at the Tanamo sugar factory. Not only is there insufficient food, but the strikers are also attempting to cut off their water supply. At the request of the British Consul General, the Cuban authorities dispatched troops today and arrested three communist leaders, who were later released. US officials are currently negotiating with the strikers, who are demanding increased wages and reduced working hours. They will only lift the siege of the British and Americans once their demands are met. A US destroyer is willing to rescue the besieged British and Americans to the ship. The British and Americans are about one and a half miles from the shore, but the US warship has no intention of sending troops ashore at present. Among those trapped are three women and five children, seven of whom are British. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Havana Members of the student council, who strongly support President San Martin, and leaders of five opposition parties reopened negotiations today at the Presidential Palace. The Presidential Palace is surrounded by armed cavalry for protection. These negotiations broke down a week ago because San Martin refused to resign. This afternoon, US Ambassador Welles and Colonel Batista, the leader of the government forces, held a meeting, but the matters they discussed were not announced. At the same time, open rebellions are occurring in two provinces. It is reported that 700 rebels have gathered near Colan, which is 92 miles southeast of Havana, and rebels have also gathered in Matanzas, 40 miles from Havana. Captain Hernandez is still confronting government forces in Camaguey. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Jewish Soil Dealer Ezra Sentenced to Twelve Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Fine of 12,000 Yuan. His Wife Also Files for Divorce.</p>
<p>San Francisco Former Shanghai Jewish wealthy men, Judah Ezra and Isaac Ezra, brothers, admitted on July 15 to committing the crime of violating narcotics laws. Today, they were each sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and fined 12,000 yuan. The District Attorney stated that the defendants had previously smuggled narcotics into San Francisco eight times, worth a total of US$1.5 million. They were only caught on the ninth attempt, when narcotics were found hidden in oil drums shipped from a Japanese ship. The defendant brothers lost their assets through various speculations and planned to smuggle contraband into the United States in order to get rich and restore their assets. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>San Francisco The Shanghai narcotics case, which caused a sensation here, was adjudicated today. The main culprits, the Ezra brothers, were each sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and fined 12,000 yuan. If they behave well in prison, they can expect a three-year reduction in their sentences in the future. The accomplices were treated leniently because they could provide direct internal information, which the government prosecutors used as evidence. Mrs. Barris and Mrs. Kunyu were each imprisoned for two years, and Ross was sentenced to five years. Shimon, who fled to Shanghai before the incident, was not mentioned in the judgment. After the judgment, Ezra Judah's wife immediately announced that she would file for divorce within ten days and would go to Shanghai after the court approved it. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Representatives Begin Arms Reduction Talks with Germany</h3>
<p>Neither Side Expressed Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Simon and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden began talks last night with German Foreign Minister Neurath, informing him of the progress of the Paris talks and exchanging views on the general situation of the Disarmament Conference. The talks continued until late at night. Neither the British nor the German side expressed dissatisfaction with this meeting. However, Neurath did not indicate to the British representatives the position Germany intended to adopt, nor did he judge the Paris talks. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Because the Administrative Committee on Armaments has achieved a presumed compromise, it is expected that the United States, Britain, France, and Italy will take a united stance against Germany in Geneva. After consultations between the American, French, and British representatives, an understanding has been reached and is now awaiting approval by the four concerned governments. According to French sources, the main difficulty remains in getting Germany to accept this view, but it is hoped that the harmony of the four powers can be successfully achieved by October 9, so that negotiations with Germany can proceed along a solid line, and the Disarmament Conference can resume on October 16. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to Le Matin, the Franco-British talks on disarmament ended today. The two sides have fully agreed in principle that the disarmament convention should include two periods of three to four years each. During the first year, called the trial period, disarmament will not be implemented, but Germany's Reichswehr should be converted to a short-term conscription system during this period. Le Matin also stated that the two sides have not yet reached an agreement on France's demand for final sanctions and the basis on which the Administrative Committee should conduct its inspections. France argues that it should be based on the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, while Britain and the United States argue that the Committee should base its work on the current level of armaments. French newspapers all carried speeches showing political acceptance, stating that the Paris talks were not intended to monopolize matters, but only to facilitate discussions at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. L'Intransigeant reported that any demands that Germany does not voluntarily accept will not be put forward. Furthermore, Paris is currently preparing to list the necessary expenses for national supervision of the arms industry in the 1934 budget, and Britain seems very opposed to the term (industrial espionage) used by France, which is also a noteworthy matter.

<h3>Franco-Russian Negotiations on Trade Agreement, Focusing on Aviation Technology Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Paris) Negotiations for the Franco-Soviet trade agreement began here yesterday. The first meeting discussed the trade relations between the two countries. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce attended. The meeting determined the negotiation agenda and organized several subcommittees to study various trade issues separately. (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, Aviation Minister Cot made a statement regarding his visit to the Soviet Union, saying that he was deeply grateful for the warm reception he received in the Soviet Union. The Soviet government is working hard on construction, especially in aviation. He personally advocated that Franco-Russian aviation should cooperate technically, which would be beneficial to international understanding and world peace. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<h3>The Bandit World in the Luan East War Zone Yao Ri</h3>
<p>Japanese Forces Allow Bandits to Ravage Local Areas Yu Xuezhong Talks About the Need to Vigorously Suppress Shi Yousan's Troops Seeking Enlistment</p>
<p>Tianjin Special Dispatch Due to the restrictions of the Tanggu Truce, the takeover of counties in the war zone has not been thorough, and the future hidden dangers are chilling. Currently, bandits in Luan East are as numerous as hairs. The county magistrate's orders cannot leave the city gate, and the security forces are not strong enough to defend themselves, let alone suppress the bandits. Last month, Zhang Jinchen, the magistrate of Luan County, led more than a thousand security forces and local militias to Zhugezhuang to suppress bandits, but was surrounded by bandits. The county seat of Linyu has never been taken over. Yin Shousong, the magistrate, set up the county government in Haiyang Town. Local traitors and despots colluded with each other, interfering in everything. Yin had no choice but to work in Qinhuangdao. Recently, even Qinhuangdao has become difficult to stand on. The postal service and telegraph in Linyu County are all in the hands of the Japanese, and it has invisibly been划归 (assigned) to the border of the puppet state. Since the Li Jichun troops were accepted, the Japanese were afraid that the counties in the war zone would gradually be governed, so they drove as many bandits as possible from outside the Guan into the Guan. We have repeatedly wanted to take over the passes of the Great Wall to curb the source of bandits, but the Japanese have unreasonably refused, citing the Tanggu Truce. Currently, the bandit atmosphere in Luan East is raging. Li Shouxin, Tang Yulin, and other troops have also窜占 (invaded and occupied) Huairou and are colluding with various factions in Luan East. Once this matures, the future of North China is unimaginable. According to Hebei Province Chairman Yu Xuezhong (The bandits in the war zone have complete weapons, and there are artillery and machine guns. Who can believe that they have no background? Such bandits with backgrounds can never be appeased. Not only will they increase, but after being enlisted, they will inevitably养痈贻患 (cause trouble in the future). The only way is to vigorously suppress them. Don't look at the fact that there are more than 10,000 bandits, which is intimidating, but in fact, they are all a rabble. If you can meet them and fight them immediately, and kill them as soon as you catch them, the bandits are also human, and no one does not贪生怕死 (fear death). If the bandits are fierce, and we are even fiercer than the bandits, then the bandits will be技穷 (at the end of their rope). Now it is not a question of whether or not to suppress them, but a question of whether or not we can suppress them. If we can suppress them, I have my own way. The Tanggu Truce restricts the entry of regular troops into the war zone, but it cannot prevent the entry of security forces. I have 10,000 security forces, which can clear all the bandits. The last time I sent 2,000 security forces, only a hundred or so in each county, was to protect the county magistrate's takeover of the government, not to suppress the bandits. Now I am rushing to compile the security forces for suppressing bandits, a total of more than 9,000 people, divided into two general teams, with Zhang Hexuan and Zhang Yunlou as the general team leaders. For the sake of unified command, a security commander will be sent. This kind of security force is guerrilla in nature. Wherever there are bandits, they will go. After obtaining the consent of the Japanese, they will be sent out immediately. It is said that someone is now advocating appeasement of the bandits. I don't object to it. As long as there is money, anyone who wants to appease them can do so. I will never appease them. The people of Hebei are suffering, and I will never increase the burden on the provincial treasury). A group of takeover committee members, such as Liu Shisun, Li Zeyi, Lei Shourong, and Yin Tong, are讳莫如深 (avoiding any mention) about the bandit atmosphere in the war zone. The bandit leader Lao Haozi, mentioned in various newspapers, is actually one of the factions in the Luan East bandits. Lao Haozi, whose surname is Zhang and name is Kuikuiyuan, is 28 years old this year and is from Renqiu County, Hebei Province. He served as a bugler with Tang Yulin for many years. When Tang abandoned Rehe, Zhang Kuikuiyuan gathered more than 20 people and became bandits. He is very honest, and people call him Lao Haozi (Goody). Now, the name Lao Haozi carried by various newspapers is its homophone. Because Haozi is honest, the number of people returning to him is increasing day by day, and his power is increasing day by day. Two months ago, Liu Shisun went to Qinhuangdao to negotiate with Shi Yousan for appeasement. At that time, Shi had a military cadre class in Qinhuangdao, with about a thousand people, and gave them military education. Shi Yousan's establishment of the cadre class was a远大 (long-term) conspiracy. At that time, because Li Jichun had already been enlisted and the Japanese army did not want to expand further, they handed over the cadres to his chief of staff, Hu Xie, to lead them to Yutian, pending the reorganization of the Hebei Provincial Government's security reserve team. This matter could have ended here, but Shi's special agent captain, Qi Wenping, was unruly and ambitious. Qi once served as a translator for the Japanese, Sakahara, and was deeply favored by Sakahara because he could be loyal to Japan. When Shi Yousan left Qinhuangdao, he declared to his confidants that he had received 80,000 yuan from the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, and had already spent 20,000 yuan. The remaining 60,000 yuan was for everyone to share. Qi Wenping received 20,000 yuan. Because he could not get a position after the reorganization, he was unwilling to服从 (submit), so he刻一伪关防 (engraved a fake seal) (the seal of the Commander-in-Chief of the East Asia Alliance United Army) and went to Changchun to seek the assistance of Sakahara. When he returned, he issued a large number of fake commissions. Zhang Kuikuiyuan was the师长 (division commander), Song Ziwen, Hu Yutian, and Guo Yazhou were the旅长 (brigade commander), and Liu Yucheng, Huang Guanghai, Bai Yutian, and Hao Wen were the团长 (regiment commander), claiming to have 10,000 people, but in reality only five or six thousand, with about 4,000 guns, and several field guns and mortar guns. These bandits were all recruited from outside the Guan and entered the Guan through Jiukou, Yiyuan, and Taolin. They had extorted 15,000 yuan from the Liujiang Coal Mining Company, 5,000 yuan from Haiyang Town, and 15,000 yuan from Qinhuangdao. Later, due to conflicts over the distribution of spoils, Guo Yazhou was shot and killed by his subordinates. The fake deputy commander Li Wenhua is from Funing County, Hebei Province. In the past, he served as a regiment commander under Xu Yuanquan. Li also has a small reputation in Funing. Last year, the Salvation Association transported supplies from Ping to outside the Guan to support the volunteer army. Because Yu Pass could not be passed, they took the road through Dushan in Funing, but were robbed by bandits. Li immediately gathered the bandits in the two counties and told them the great righteousness, and helped the volunteer army resist Japan. The Salvation Association appointed Li as the Commander of Traffic in Fu and Du. This spring, Rehe fell, and Luan East was沦胥 (devastated). Li came to Tianjin and stayed at No. 15 Dabe Hotel in the Japanese Concession. Among the bandits in Luan East this time, it is said that there are many volunteer soldiers, such as Song Ziwen and Hu Yutian, who served as regular officers and led the volunteer army to resist Japan outside the Guan, and had many accomplishments. Therefore, after these people entered the Guan, the Japanese Kwantung Army stopped supplying and assisting them. The people in each village and town could not bear the harassment and fled. These people robbed and burned the villages and towns because they could not rob anything else. Therefore, the people became more and more afraid and fled away. These people saw that they were about to陷于死地 (fall into a dead end), so they requested enlistment. There are two reasons for this: (1) Qi Wenping claimed to be a subordinate of You San, and Hu Xie's troops had already been enlisted, and Qi's troops could not be excluded. (2) Song Ziwen and others claimed, "We are all volunteer soldiers, and we have made contributions to resisting Japan. The central government should enlist us." Therefore, last week, they requested to pass through Funing County and go to Yutian to wait for reorganization. Their intention was to earn the opening of the city gate and wash it out. County Magistrate Liu Xingpei telegraphed the province for instructions. Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong immediately telegraphed the Beiping Military Commission to ask whether to approve the enlistment. It is said that it has not been approved. Liu Shisun also said that the enlistment was not approved. Yu immediately telegraphed County Magistrate Liu to refuse to pass through the road. Liu immediately notified the two counties of Lulong and Qian'an to cooperate in defense, and sent Public Security Bureau Director Wu Jinrong to lead about 1,000 security forces and local militias out of the city to intercept them. On the 20th, the bandits came in three routes. Because of the disparity in numbers, they could not resist and retreated to the city. The bandits set fire outside the southeast gate and fired artillery at the city from Zijin Mountain. From the 20th to the 21st, a total of more than 50 cannons were fired. Fortunately, most of the shells did not explode. County Magistrate Liu telegraphed the provincial government three times in urgent. Yu Xuezhong has telegraphed to transfer three platoons of security forces from Tangshan, about 400 people, to drive to support on the 22nd. If County Magistrate Liu can hold on for three more days, it is hoped that the bandits will be defeated. However, without planning a fundamental solution, Luan East will never have a peaceful day.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Has Returned to Nanchang from Lushan</h3>
<p>Huang Shaohong and Others Went to the Province to Meet</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence Huang Shaohong, along with Tao Jun, a staff officer of the Beiping Military Branch, and Xiong Bin, etc., went south from Ping. On the 20th, they arrived in Xun by Ning Shao wheel. They originally planned to visit Chairman Chiang in Lushan, but Chiang had already returned to Nanchang from Lushan. Huang then took the Nanchang-Xun Railway car to the province on the morning of the 21st, arriving around 1 p.m. After Huang, Yang, etc. entered the city, they stayed at the Yang Provincial Government Guesthouse. Soon Xiong Shiwei visited and talked for an hour. Huang then accompanied Xiong to inspect the construction of the airport outside Shun. That evening, he went to the Xingying to visit Chiang to report on the inspection of Hebei, Shanxi, and Sui areas, and the meetings with He Yingqin, Yu Xuezhong, Song Zheyuan, Yan Xishan, Fu Zuoyi, and Northeast military and political officials.</p>
<p>He Chenghao, who arrived in Nanchang one day before Huang Shaohong, also visited Chiang today (the 21st) to report on the situation of suppressing bandits in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and the progress of suppressing the Red Army on the border of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. There was also a detailed discussion on the plan to eliminate the remnants of He Long, Xu Xiangqian, Zhang Guotao, and Kong Hechong, and the post-war affairs in the bandit areas. Xiong Bin and Tao Jun came here to report to Chiang on the reduction of pay and downsizing of the Northeast armies. Other representatives who came to Jiangxi, such as Guo Weiping, the representative from Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, and Shaanxi who requested funding for cotton and wheat and the completion of the Longhai Railway, and funding for disaster relief in Shaanxi and Gansu, were instructed by Chiang in Lushan to come to Nanchang for an audience. They will visit the Xingying in order in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Collapse of Red Bandits in Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>Yanping, Shunchang, and Jiangle have all been relieved. The 19th Route Army Headquarters is moving to Yanping.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The battles near Yanping from September 5th to 8th were the most intense. The bandits launched fierce attacks on the northeast cities with large forces, even forming youth suicide squads, hoping to scale the walls. The Jiang Yan Brigade, which was defending the city, concentrated artillery fire and fought valiantly. The provincial government also sent airplanes to bomb, inflicting countless casualties on the bandits. On the 9th, the Jiang Brigade seized the opportunity to open the city gates and counterattack, causing the bandits to flee in disarray, one group fleeing towards Shunchang, and another towards Shaxian. The bandits fleeing to Shaxian were ambushed by the stationed Pang Cheng Brigade and fled further northwest. Yanping has opened its city gates since the 10th, allowing people to move freely. The bandits, having suffered heavy losses in their attack on Yanping, failed to conquer Shunchang and Jiangle (both cities defended by Liu Heding's division), wasting time and ammunition. Moreover, the national army's reinforcements had arrived at their designated locations and were about to launch a general offensive. Fearing attacks from both front and rear, the bandits began to withdraw most of their forces from Shunchang and Jiangle to Jianning and Tai'ning on the 12th to defend against the national army's advance in northern Fujian. Most of the bandits in Mingxi and Qingliu retreated to Changting and Liancheng to defend against the national army's advance in western Fujian, using Jianning as their base in northern Fujian and Changting as their base in western Fujian, putting up a last-ditch resistance. The national army is using Yanping as the military center of northern Fujian, with Jian'ou and Shaxian as the left and right wings, and Longyan as the military center of western Fujian, with Shanghang and Liancheng as the left and right wings. Previously, the main military force was focused on western Fujian, so the bandits were able to take the opportunity to sneak into northern Fujian and wreak havoc. Now the military authorities have reorganized the troops, with four divisions of Shen Guanghan, Qu Shounian, Zhang Huo, and the Cantonese army's Huang Renhuan stationed in western Fujian, and four divisions of Tan Qixiu, Mao Weishou, Liu Heding, and Lu Xingbang stationed in northern Fujian, forming a large arc-shaped defense line from western Fujian to northern Fujian. In peacetime, it is strictly sealed off, prohibiting the import of grain and ammunition into the bandit areas. In wartime, no matter where the bandits flee, they can be dealt a head-on blow. Furthermore, as the focus of bandit suppression has shifted from western Fujian to northern Fujian, the headquarters of the 19th Route Army has also moved from Longyan to Yanping. On the 13th, Chief of Staff Zhao Yijian led all the officers from the province to Yanping to handle general offensive matters. Further news: After being repelled by the Jiang Yan Brigade, the bandits attacking Yanping are still gathering at Wangtai, Xiayang, Maodi, and Yangkou, located in the three counties of Nanping (i.e., Yanping), Shunchang, and Shaxian, plotting to peep at opportunities. The Tan Qixiu Division has now arrived in Yanping, and the Mao Weishou Division has left Shaxian, flanking forward on the left and right wings, while the Liu Heding Division stationed in Jian'ou has joined forces with the Zhang Luanji unit of the Independent Brigade of the Central Army, which newly entered Fujian from Zhejiang and arrived in Jianyang from Pucheng, to advance towards Shunchang. Fearing that their rear will be cut off, the bandits have begun to withdraw the bandits above Yanping and below Shunchang to above Shunchang, so that they can contact the bandits in Jiangle. It is expected that Wangtai, Xiayang, Maodi, and Yangkou will be recovered soon, and the siege of Shunchang County will also be lifted. In the future, the anti-bandit military operations in northern Fujian will be moved to between the three counties of Shunchang, Shaxian, and Jiangle. At that time, the troops defending Jiangle County can also come out of the city to flank the bandits. Also, the two banks of the river from Yanping through Shuikou to Fuzhou were previously harassed by local bandits under Fu Jianglong and Chen Puchun, who took the opportunity to cut off the telegraph lines near Xiadao, which greatly affected transportation. Now that the bandits have been searched and cleared by the Tan Division, the telegraph lines were also repaired on the 20th and are reporting as usual. A large number of firewood boats arrived in the province from Yuexi, Yanping, the day before yesterday. Yesterday (20th), the provincial capital also transported a large amount of rice and salt to Yanping to supply food to the people. A portion of the people who fled from Yanping to the province previously intend to request the provincial government to send ships to transport them back to Yanping. It is said that Cai Tingkai can also lead the headquarters officers from Shuikou to Yanping within one or two days to direct military affairs. Deng Shizeng, who was sent to Guangdong by Cai some days ago to discuss bandit suppression matters, returned to the province the day before yesterday to report. It is said that Chen Jitang has agreed to send three divisions of Huang Renhuan, Huang Zhiwen, and Huang Tingzhen to Fujian to assist in suppression, and an air force team to carry out bombing. The Huang Renhuan Division has entered Shanghang and Yongding. The Zhang Yan Division, which was originally stationed in that county, has gone to Longyan to block the bandits in northern Fujian to prevent them from sneaking back into western Fujian.

<h3>Guangdong Levies Tax on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Taxing one silver dollar per hundred catties. Special Agricultural Product Tax Bureaus established in various places.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Provincial Political Research Association, recently acting on Chen Jitang's instructions, sent a letter to the provincial government, requesting the immediate collection of a special tax on foreign rice, the revenue from which would be earmarked for the Farmers Bank fund and rural relief. The tax rate would be based on the standard that the rice price should not exceed the highest price in previous years, but the minimum tax would be one dollar per hundred catties. This was submitted to the provincial affairs meeting for discussion, and it was resolved to approve the collection of one silver dollar per dan (hundred catties) to develop agriculture and provide rural relief throughout Guangdong Province, and it was decided to implement it from September 16th. At the same time, the Special Bureau of Import Agricultural Products Tax was established, with a bureau in Guangzhou, Chaozhou-Meizhou, Wuyi, Qinlian, and Qiongya, and sub-stations in Sanshui, Shenzhen, and other places to collect import taxes on imported agricultural products and special taxes on foreign rice. However, after the Finance Department issued a proclamation to levy a special tax on foreign rice, the Guangzhou rice market suddenly changed. The Guangdong province's grain has always been unable to supply itself, so Annam and Siamese rice are daily necessities. Now that a special import tax of one silver dollar per hundred catties of foreign rice is levied at once, the impact on rice prices is extremely significant. Therefore, after the proclamation was issued, rice merchants with abundant stocks rushed to hoard and raise prices to one dollar per dan. At the present time, when water and drought have occurred one after another, the rice fields throughout the province have failed to yield a harvest, and the price of foreign rice has risen sharply due to the tax. The plight of the people of Guangdong in this time of food shortage is indescribable. Rice merchants have already submitted a petition to the provincial government, appealing for the abolition of the special tax to alleviate the people's difficulties, stating: "The people of Guangdong lack food, with only four months' worth of grain a year, relying entirely on foreign rice for supply. Recently, rice is as expensive as pearls, with only eight or nine catties per dollar. Coupled with the increasing cost of living, the people are in dire straits and have long been unable to extricate themselves. It was investigated that the central government planned to levy import tax on foreign rice last year, but due to the different situation in Guangdong province, the Southwest Political Affairs Council telegraphed its opposition, and the matter was shelved. The people of Guangdong cheered, saying that the authorities cared for our people, and that this harsh tax that disturbs the people would not be allowed to reappear today. Unexpectedly, the Guangdong province recently had the sudden move to levy an import tax on foreign rice, and the warning news came, and we were deeply shocked. Once the foreign rice is taxed, the rice price will inevitably rise sharply. What crime have the people committed to suffer this torment? If it is said that the foreign rice tax is to maintain agricultural products, etc., I do not know that if we really maintain agricultural products, there are many ways, such as only to foreign rice taxation, increasing the people's burden, not seen its benefits, first suffer its harm, rice merchants business is not worth cherishing, but what about the 30 million people of Guangdong? For this, we appeal to take into account the lack of rice and stone in Guangdong, which is very different from other provinces. If we implement foreign rice taxation, it is very harmful to the people's food. It is appropriate to quickly abolish it, which is enough to maintain the people's food. Urgent words, I beg you to understand. Chairman Zhang Tiejun and the entire buyers' group of more than 300 people of the Guangzhou Rice Merchants Association kowtow together." (with seals) It is said that after the rice merchants sent this telegram, rice merchants have telegraphed Hong Kong since the 19th to temporarily suspend the import of rice and stone, pending resolution. The public also opposes this move by the provincial government, as its purpose of levying a special import tax on foreign rice is to raise funds, which is different from the central government's intention to suppress the dumping of foreign rice to make domestic rice and grain circulate in the Yangtze River area, so as to relieve the rural areas.

<h3>Tragic Conditions in Baoshan and Songkou Sands After Disasters</h3>
<p>The five sands of Changxing and Ruifeng belonging to Baoshan County are located outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, surrounded by water, and prone to tidal disasters. During the hurricane on the 2nd of this month, these sands were directly hit, suffering extremely heavy disasters. The Chinese Amity Relief Committee and others went to distribute emergency relief, as reported in detail previously. Unexpectedly, on the 18th of this month, a second hurricane brought another major disaster. At that time, the raging tides and huge waves broke through the embankments and rushed in, turning the entire area into a water country. Houses were swept away, and countless people and livestock drowned. The harvested rice was also carried away by the tide. The tragedy of the disaster is not only worse than the previous one, but also unprecedented. Although the tide has receded, the embankments have been completely destroyed, and the protection of life has been lost. With the autumn tides coming soon, the consequences are worrying. The survivors are alone and without support, starving and on the verge of death. Although these sands are sand islands, with limited areas, the population is not small, with Changxing Sand having the largest number (8,000-9,000 people). Now that the weather is turning cold in an instant, if this continues, it will all become starvation. The owners and citizens of these sands are asking the Baoshan County Government, and entrusting Mr. Zhou Zizhen to plead with the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Chinese Amity Relief Committee, and others to find ways to provide relief and raise funds to repair the embankments, so that more than 10,000 victims can be rescued as soon as possible, and the embankments protecting life can be repaired as soon as possible. However, the disaster there is extremely serious, and it is particularly dependent on huge relief efforts. It is hoped that all charitable organizations and philanthropists will generously contribute and donate generously to increase strength, so as to save the victims, benefit endlessly, and what is concerned is not only a county or a province.</p>
<h3>Nantong Water Police Team Protects Fishermen and Suppresses Bandits</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Department of the Provincial Water Police, because the coastal area of ​​Jiangbei is now at the time when jellyfish are abundantly produced, and fishermen go out to sea to catch them, there are sea bandits harassing them, so a special team was dispatched to protect the fishermen and suppress the bandits. Outside Lingdian Port, the bandits were scattered and a female bandit Jiang Wang and bandit Nifeng were captured. On the 23rd, the Department of Civil Affairs ordered the district department to hand over the captured bandits to the Nantong County Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>The case of the Nan Shi Yuxing Company's Xin Renhe steamer murdering thieves Ma Koubao, Mei Laoer, and others was judged by the Shanghai Local Court, which detained and sentenced the shipowner Sun Xingsheng and others. Sun and others refused to accept and appealed to the Suzhou High Court.

<h3>Wuxi The Evil Kidnapper Deserves to Be Killed</h3>
<p>Kunshan girl Wu Jinfeng lost her parents early. Due to difficult living conditions in Kunshan, she came to Wuxi in the summer of this year through the introduction of a friend and worked as a female worker in the Zhoushanbang Silk Factory outside the North Gate, struggling to make a living. In the early part of this month, Wu Jinfeng went to a shoe stall under Yunqiao to buy shoes, and met several kidnappers, including Wang Guoliang. Wang saw that Jinfeng was vulnerable and used something resembling a pistol to intimidate her, forcing her to go with him. Jinfeng was a weak woman with little knowledge, so she had to follow him. She was detained in the house of Wang Xiaobianzi in Zhoushanbang for five days and five nights, and was raped by Wang Guoliang and others. Jinfeng cried in Wang's house for five days and five nights, and her eyes were swollen like peaches. The kidnapper, fearing that she would become a blind old woman, took her to Shanghai, hoping to sell her to a brothel. Unexpectedly, the brothels refused to take Jinfeng because of her eye disease. Wang and others had no choice but to take her back to Wuxi and entrust the old woman Cao Liu to mediate a marriage with Li Rongfu, a police officer from the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, receiving eighty silver dollars for the dowry. Unexpectedly, Wu Jinfeng continued to cry after arriving at Li's house. Li Rongfu did not know the truth, and initially suspected that she had no clothes and agreed to buy them for her. After questioning, she told the truth. Li Rongfu was extremely angry and took Jinfeng to negotiate with Cao Liu, limiting her to hand over Wang Guoliang. Later, Cao Liu handed over Wang Guoliang and Zhang Qiliang to Li, who took them to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau under his jurisdiction, presented them to the County Public Security Bureau, and transferred them to the County Court yesterday. Prosecutor Ren opened the court. Cao Liu confessed that he only used six yuan for matchmaking fees, Zhang Qiliang only used four yuan, Wang Guoliang used forty yuan, and the rest was used by others. Prosecutor Ren checked the confession and ordered Li Rongfu and Cao Liu to return home, and Wang Guoliang and Zhang Qiliang were taken into custody. Because Wu Jinfeng had no family members, she was temporarily taken in by the court, waiting for her family members from Kunshan to come to Wuxi to claim her.</p>
<h3>Changshu Another Corruption Incident in Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>After the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county had a corruption incident of inspectors extorting and cheating this spring, all inspectors were suspended, and the work of the association was suspended. Except for thirteen pieces of Japanese yarn (worth about five thousand yuan), the rest of the seized enemy goods were auctioned off. As for the Japanese yarn, it was still shelved and sealed due to unequal competition for purchase at the time. Unexpectedly, before the Dragon Boat Festival of this year, a certain committee member secretly pledged a part of the sealed Japanese yarn to the pawnshop. Now, on the 18th of this month, the Japanese yarn was secretly auctioned off completely. The incident was learned by the County Party Department, which immediately resolved to report it and sent Party Committee Member Shi Minyong to investigate. In order to avoid targeting, the association's instructor Wu Zhongying requested to resign from the position of instructor. Currently, Committee Member Shi is conducting a strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Business Tax Dispute Unresolved</h3>
<p>The Business Tax Bureau of this county intends to increase the tax amount by 50,000 yuan from this year and decided to investigate the accounts of each business one by one. Because business has been depressed in recent years, all stores believe that it is impossible to increase taxes and unanimously oppose it. Chairman Pang Jie of the Chamber of Commerce and County Chief Zhou Heng have mediated many times without any effect. The Bureau of Business Tax still insisted on its own way and continued to check accounts door to door. The day before yesterday, when checking a certain bamboo shop, they actually arrested the shop owner, which expanded the situation. Representatives of various merchants jointly petitioned the Party and government agencies and filed a complaint with the Department of Finance, requesting the dismissal of Huang Xia, the head of the Bureau of Business Tax, who illegally arrested businessmen. Currently, the county chief and the Chamber of Commerce are still planning to mediate, and the Bureau has shown signs of compromise.</p>

They were staying in Rooms 43, 44, 45, and 46 on the third floor. Among them was a student, Ma Rulun, who moved to Room 54 due to catching a cold and the noise of many people, accompanied by another classmate, Wang Gang. Wang had a passionate love affair with a girl in Jinyun, but it was taken advantage of and he was heartbroken. He was always depressed and full of remorse. At ten o'clock that night, he sneaked to the fourth floor and jumped down from a high place, intending to commit suicide. He was spotted and rescued, hired a car and sent to the Municipal Hospital. He was seriously injured, his breath was weak, and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Thirteen-Year-Old Girl Murders Fiance</h3>
<p>Chen Zhou, a farmer in Hubu, Shangxiang, Hang County, had some property. Her husband died of illness years ago, leaving only a daughter, Fengzhen, who is now thirteen years old. In August of last year, she recruited Wu Ayou from Shaoxing as her son-in-law. Because Fengzhen was young, no wedding ceremony was held. Ayou was not engaged in proper work and was deeply disgusted and hated by Chen, who could not drive him away. The night before, she instructed Fengzhu to crush Wu's testicles to death while he was asleep. She hastily coffined and buried him, falsely claiming that he hanged himself. This was learned by the local Fang Gong, who reported it to the police station and sent Chen Zhou to the court. A prosecutor Zhou Zhao was sent to inspect and conduct examination led by examiner Feng Yongnian. The results of the autopsy revealed that he died from testicular damage. Fengzhen and her mother were arrested and detained for questioning.</p>
<h3>Letter From Jinling Arsenal</h3>
<p>Sir, I read a Nanjing dispatch on the 21st in your newspaper on September 22nd, regarding the news that the factory's trial release of shells injured civilians. After investigation, this factory was testing the fuses of mortars manufactured by our factory from 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 20th, and no accidents occurred. The time of the bombing was around 4:30 p.m. according to the residents nearby. Also, this factory stopped making hand grenade two years ago. The family members of the child and the nearby residents knew that he was playing with a hand grenade that he picked up and was bombed. This shows that it has nothing to do with this factory. The family members of the child have not come to negotiate. Also, this factory is very cautious in testing cannons and guns and has members to protect them. All unused items are collected and returned to the factory, and those that penetrate deep into the soil are also dug out to avoid danger. If long-distance and explosive tests are required, they are carried out in Qinglong Mountain. The facts are all there. The Nanjing Evening News reported that the factory's trial cannons injured civilians. The news did not match the facts. In addition to having sent a separate letter to the Evening News for correction, I especially wrote to you requesting that you check and make corrections to clarify the truth. Best regards, Jinling Arsenal, September 23</p>

<h3>Longhua to Become Major Aviation Port American Architect Murphy Has Already Drawn Plans</h3>
<p>The mainland newspapers say: "Government officials are currently considering expanding the Longhua Airport plan to make it a large aviation port for both land and water, comparable to Le Bourget in Paris, Tempelhof in Berlin, Roosevelt and Burbank in the United States. Shanghai will soon become the meeting point for air routes to Europe and the United States within two or three years, so there is an urgent need to set up a large aviation port. The Longhua Airport has all the necessary conditions for constituting a good aviation port and is also very close to railway, car, and water transportation. It is truly an excellent choice for an aviation port. The American architect Murphy has already drawn plans, planning for a land airport that is 2,400 feet long from north to south and 3,000 feet wide from east to west. The water airport uses all the equipment of the Huangpu River. Everything will be the most modern. The estimated cost is approximately nearly 2 million yuan."</p>
<h3>Submerged Reef Discovered on East Coast Sea</h3>
<p>Extremely Dangerous Situation Shipping Industry Must Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Survey Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy recently measured a submerged reef on the sea off Kangyu Island in Luoyuan Bay on the east coast.

The current status of the submerged reef is extremely dangerous, and the shipping industry must pay attention. The shoal 4.5 chains from Kangyu Port has now disappeared.</p>
<h3>Industrial Safety Association Formulates Nine Safety Plans</h3>
<p>Advocating Factory Cleanliness Periodic Inspection of Boilers Banqueted Experts and Consultants the Day Before Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Industrial Safety Association held a banquet at the Yiyou Society on Hankou Road at 7 p.m. the day before yesterday to entertain various experts, consultants, and new members. Those present included Liang Zhongjian, Li Youpeng, Zhu Maocheng, Li Tingan, and new members Shenxin Spinning Mill, China Chemical Industry Society, Gongqin Iron Factory, Meyer Silk Factory, Zhonghua Book Company, Datong Book Company, Zhenhua Paint Factory, Wu Yun Chu, Chen Diexian, Shi Jiuyun, Zhang Zilian, Yang Yonghui, Yang Weiyin, Gu Xizhi, Hu Xiyuan, Hu Zuan, Feng Yunchu, Cheng Shouzhong, Chen Guocang, Wang Zuocai, Fang Jiange, sponsor Pan Gongzhan (represented by Sun Daosheng), and guest Qian Chengxu, totaling more than 60 people. The work plan was also approved. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Address</h3>
<p>By Chen Diexian, Wu YunChu, Shi JiuYun</p>
<p>Chairman, first Chen Diexian delivered a welcoming speech, saying that industrial safety work is urgently needed by the Chinese industrial sector at present, and this kind of work especially requires guidance from various experts. We have suffered many losses in the past, and we can no longer suffer them now, because we already have many experienced experts to serve as consultants to this association and to guide us. Therefore, today we would like to especially welcome boiler inspection expert Mr. Liang Zhongjian, engineering expert Mr. Li Youpeng, factory hygiene expert Mr. Li Ting'an, labor expert Mr. Zhu Maocheng (and architecture expert Mr. Xue Xingzhong), and at the same time welcome many new members to join our team and work together to extinguish disasters in factories, in order to achieve the goal of safety. Then, the expert consultants delivered speeches. First, Mr. Zhu Maocheng spoke about the need for industrial safety in our country and how the international community is concerned about our country's industrial safety movement. At the 14th National Labor Congress, he made a wish to the other 46 countries, saying that soon we in China would also promote the industrial safety movement, and now, surprisingly, in Shanghai, there are enthusiastic industrialists and leaders organizing the Industrial Safety Association, with factory owners voluntarily promoting the industrial safety movement. This is an honor for the industrial sector and a new glory for our country in the international community. It is hoped that factories across the country will join. He then talked about the methods for carrying out industrial safety work, which should be carried out in three aspects: first, the government should supervise factories to implement safety from the legislative, judicial, and administrative perspectives; second, factories should voluntarily improve equipment to reduce disasters; and third, workers should cooperate with factories and jointly take responsibility to eliminate disasters.</p>
<h3>Expert Lectures</h3>
<p>Boiler expert Liang Zhongjian's speech mainly meant that the scope of industrial safety work is very broad, and making a factory absolutely safe is not an easy task, but there are many extremely great dangers that can be avoided if a little attention is paid to them at ordinary times. Therefore, my intention is that when discussing industrial safety, don't think that this topic has thousands of threads and don't know where to start, and don't do everything according to the methods of foreign large factories, starting on a large scale, which will lead to a grandiose start and a weak finish, with no results. We hope to hold fewer meetings and do more work. As for the boiler inspection method, we also advocate starting with a very simple method. Finally, I hope that everyone will have a kind of practical work for the industrial safety movement. (2) Hygiene expert consultant Dr. Li Ting'an lectured on the relationship between factory hygiene and worker health. Worker health and factory production are also closely related. Factory owners in our country often do not care about the health of workers, which hinders production. A few years ago, the owner of a carpet factory in Beiping came to ask me why the child laborers in our factory were not growing up and were not energetic in their work. Later, the research result was that the workers lacked vitamins, which caused eye diseases. Later, methods were devised to improve it, and after two weeks, great results were seen, and there is no such phenomenon now. Recently, I have seen some factories hiring a doctor to visit the factory for one or two hours a day, and sometimes hiring several nurses. At that time, I asked them what kind of work they were doing. They were only doing some symptomatic medical work, and did not pay any attention to the fundamental prevention work. This is a big mistake. We advocate factory hygiene to do fundamental work. This fundamental work is to find ways to prevent and pay attention to the nutrition of workers. As for the work of carrying out factory hygiene, it is hoped that the government and your association will cooperate and jointly organize a committee to discuss all the work that should be done.</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>Then, the discussion began. First, the general secretary reported on the establishment and current situation of the association, and passed the first year's work plan. Finally, the general secretary introduced Li Shude, editor-in-chief of the Industrial Safety Monthly, Jiang Zhiyong, special editor, Lu Jicang, etc. After taking a photo, Chen Diexian temporarily proposed to increase the number of copies of the Industrial Safety Monthly, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Yellow River Disaster Relief News</h3>
<p>Establishing Disaster Relief Sub-Associations and Appointing Directors for Various Locations</p>
<p>After the regulations of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee were passed by the Executive Yuan, Xi Dejiong, director of the Disaster Relief Group, immediately began preparations in Shanghai. As a result of the meeting held by the association in Beijing the previous day, in view of the excessive disaster situation and the large number of refugees in the disaster areas this time, it was decided to set up disaster relief committee sub-associations in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, and to hire local officials and gentry as members of the sub-associations to provide assistance. According to a reporter's investigation, the group has telegraphed Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu, Henan Chairman Liu Zhi, and invited Li Shuchun, He Siyuan, Zhang Honglie, Zhao Xinru, He Supu, Sun Tongxuan, Xin Zhujiu, Lin Yuanqing, Xu Lizhi, Jiang Qing, Cheng Jingsheng, Yin Chengzhi, Mei Yilin, Zhou Baipeng, etc. as members of the Shandong Disaster Relief Sub-Association, Fang Qidao, Li Peiji, Zhang Jingyu, Feng Jianfei, Zhang Boying, Huai Zhu Jiao, Zhang Guangyu, Li Da, Du Fudong, Liu Hailou, Yang Zigong, Ding Yingwu, Mei Yilin, etc. as members of the Henan Disaster Relief Sub-Association, and the members of the Hebei Sub-Association are also being selected. As for investigating the disaster situation and distributing relief supplies, investigation and distribution offices will be established in each province. It is said that Cheng Jingsheng has been invited as the director of the Shandong Provincial Investigation and Distribution Office, Yang Mingsheng as the director of the Henan Provincial Investigation and Distribution Office, and Tang Zongguo as the director of the Hebei Provincial Investigation and Distribution Office. In order to facilitate the purchase of relief supplies, purchasing and transportation offices will be set up in Jinan and Kaifeng, and Gao Dawang, deputy director of the Lishi Society, will be transferred as the director of the purchasing and transportation offices. The directors went to the disaster areas yesterday and today to implement the work. In addition, the internal organization of the disaster relief group is divided into three sections: general affairs, investigation and distribution, and purchasing and transportation. Xi Kuang is the director of the general affairs section, Jin Guanfu is the director of the investigation and distribution section, and Gao Da, the director of the purchasing and transportation office, is concurrently the director of the purchasing and transportation section. There are two secretaries, Zhu Yong and Gao Dawang, it is said.</p>
<h3>Disaster Situation Reports from Various Places</h3>
<p>County Funds and Property Office, etc. Huang YunShen and Kang Yongnian, director and deputy director of the Shanghai County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, and Wu Shifang, etc., the district chiefs of the county, telegraphed to the Civil and Financial Departments of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the county government yesterday, saying that in early this month, Shanghai was hit by continuous wind and rain, and the agricultural products in the fields have been damaged. On the evening of the 18th, a hurricane passed through Shanghai, accompanied by torrential rain, which lasted for days and nights, destroying houses and breaking trees, beyond count. The county's jurisdiction is all farmland, and cotton and rice are just being harvested, but the rice is falling in the fields, and the cotton bolls waiting to be picked are also shaken by the wind and rain, and those that are withered and broken are everywhere. It is estimated that the harvest will have to lose four or five out of ten. The innocent farmers have worked hard for three seasons, and their economic sweat and blood will be used to feed themselves and seek warmth, but the sudden disaster has caused the crops that have been cultivated in the countryside, which have been the source of their livelihood, to be destroyed like this. The directors and district chiefs are in the folk and have a heart of compassion. They dare not hide it from above. They will telegraph the situation of the previous wind and rain disasters to you, and ask you to plan for compassion, and they cannot wait to be ordered.</p>
<p>Fifth District Inspector Cao Zhenfei, the administrative inspector of the Fifth District of Jiangsu, is now telegraphing to the Xinwei Relief Association to urgently provide relief because the two counties of Chuansha and Nanhui have been severely affected by the hurricane. The original telegram said that the previous telegraph requested relief from the Chuansha County in this district because of the typhoon. Now, the two counties of Chuannan have successively telegraphed that the two typhoons have passed through the territory, and the wind is even more fierce than the one or two days ago. The Chuansha Railway has been destroyed, and traffic is almost cut off. Hengsha is isolated in the sea and has suffered heavy losses, which are being investigated in detail. Nanhui has uprooted trees and collapsed houses, which are seen repeatedly. The urban area is like this, and the coast can be imagined. They are all requesting to transfer and beg for relief, etc. Because of the thought that the survivors after the disaster have suffered another catastrophe, and they have not yet finished crying for hunger, and they will be cold again, although they have been supervised by the county governments to</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui's Elegy for Chen Jingcun</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihui's elegy for Chen Jingcun said, "He was able to have nothing long outside of his body, and his name will be passed down in history, which shows that heroes have value. The letter of repentance that was sought ten years ago has been sent to the Yellow Springs, and you will definitely invite your younger brother to be as before." Mr. Jingcun, eternal rest. Your younger brother, Wu Jingheng, bows and offers his condolences. He also recognized that in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Prime Minister was about to launch the Northern Expedition, fearing that Dongjiang Lingbing would contain him. Mr. Wang Jingwei instructed Yu and Mr. Zou Haibin to meet Chen at Shanwei to talk about the uprising. Chen agreed and went to the Prime Minister's Shaoguan camp to tell him. The Prime Minister only asked for a letter of repentance and had no other conditions. Later, Chen was held by his subordinates, and it did not happen. The Prime Minister suffered many setbacks in his life, but he treated those who could repent as before, and even used them generously. It is a pity that this letter was not completed after all. Mr. Jingcun's life after his death was bleak, and he had nothing long outside of his body, which is what he could enter the ground with a smile. However, the public opinion thinks that he cannot rest in peace. Is it unexpected that he will get such a grand funeral as Sheng Xuanhuai, and the inheritance lawsuits after the death of Ni Sichong and Feng Guozhang are considered qualified? If so, then today's scholars who risk their lives, even those who hold high positions, are quite addicted to profit and do not stop. They are the ones who understand the psychology of the masses and manufacture sons as opium addicts and playboys. They do not care. Mr. Chen, please work hard! The hard work and study of the late Mr. Gong Zhengyu and others were outstanding, Jingheng also recognized.</p>
<p>Slightly provide urgent relief, a drop in the bucket, difficult to be universal, should send another telegram to your association, to consider the virtue of the treacherous life, broadly issue righteous millet and benevolent pulp, the more the better, rescue this survivor, and help him to board the seat, then the merit is immeasurable, please nine times, Cao Zhenfei, administrative inspector of the Fifth District of Jiangsu, respectfully printed,</p>
<p>Zhenhai Embankment Works Bureau, Zhenhai County Embankment Works Bureau sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Association, saying that since entering autumn, this county has suffered two typhoons, and the time interval is only more than ten days. The storm surge on the night of the 18th of this month was unprecedented in the past century. On that night, the tide crossed the embankment surface, more than three or four feet above, and the city and countryside were all turned into a country of water. The fields and houses were submerged, and people and animals were lost. The magnitude of the loss is incalculable. The Houhai embankment, which was just completed this year, was also damaged in many places due to the invasion of strong winds and huge waves. It is estimated that from Jinzishan to Yufan Road, more than 1,600 feet of stone embankment, of which more than 200 feet were damaged, causing the entire sea embankment to be affected and in danger. The saying goes, a single spark can start a prairie fire, and a trickle of water can become a river. Today, the Houhai embankment in this county also has this scene. Hou Pei and others met and sent people to survey, and they were worried about the dangerous situation they witnessed. This embankment is the guarantee of the lives and property of the people of the six counties. Once there is an accident, they will all become fish and shrimp. At that time, the tragic situation is still unimaginable. Pei and others have the heart to fill the sea, but they do not have the strength to carry the mountain. They dare not be verbose and earnestly express their feelings, and sincerely ask the fellow villagers to take care of their hometown, generously donate, and help this public welfare. If you are entrusted to solicit donations, you will be even more grateful. When writing, the mind is racing, and the anticipation is overwhelming. This is to ask the fellow villagers of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association to give their advice.</p>
<p>Red Swastika General Association The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a letter from the Beiping Red Swastika General Association yesterday, reporting that the disaster situation in Huaxian and Juye counties was extremely serious. Now, I will look for the original letter and record it in separate issues. (Huaxian) Briefly said that after this team arrived in Huaxian, it investigated that the county was decided by the thieves on August 3 at the Hebei Changyuan Dike Kou, and the water entered the territory of Hua, and it became an unprecedented tragic disaster. Huaxian has a total of ten districts, and the most severely affected are the five, six, seven, and three districts in the southeast. The disaster area is about 5,000 square miles, and the submerged rice fields are worth about 8 million yuan, and the property loss is about 10 million yuan. The livestock drowned is about 15,000, worth about 750,000 yuan. In total, 426 villages were submerged in the three districts, 42,369 households were affected, about 450,000 houses were affected, about 300,000 people were affected, and about 10,000 people died. This group released about 1,300 to 1,400 yuan of ocean in each district, for a total of 3,743 yuan of ocean for disaster relief, it is said. (Juye) Briefly said that after this team went to Juye, in view of the wide disaster area, it was impossible to do things without division of labor and cooperation, so it divided into groups and districts and set off. For days, it has released disaster households a total of more than 1,400 households, each household ranging from one, two, three, and four yuan. Now the water has fallen, but too many houses have collapsed, and there are many places where the entire village has been destroyed. The victims have no food and no shelter, and their lives have reached a desperate situation. The submerged area is more than 30 miles from north to south and more than 90 miles from east to west, with more than 400 villages and about 100,000 victims. However, the amount of relief funds brought is limited, and there are many victims, and it is difficult to provide universal relief. Only those who have been most severely affected have been released first, so that they can survive. The medicines brought were also released at the same time and will be exhausted. The victims were born from desperation, and the local people praised them with their foreheads, it is said.</p>
<p>Sun Chuanfang, Kou Yingjie, etc. Sun Chuanfang, Kou Yingjie, etc. telegraphed Zhu Qinglan yesterday, saying that Mr. Zhu Ziqiao Jian, the Yellow River in Hebei and Henan breached, and the Xihe River in western Shandong was flooded, and the victims were particularly deep. Now the dead are floating corpses all over the field, and the living are begging everywhere. There are many post-disaster events, and they are waiting for urgent relief. Shandong is my public second hometown. I beg you to widely call for it, and try your best to find a way. Millions of victims will live together.

<h3>Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration Investigates the Losses of Coastal Fishermen in the Typhoon</h3>
<p>Submitting a Report to the Ministry of Industry to Add Seven New Ocean-Protecting Ships and Improving Fishing Gear is a Top Priority</p>
<p>In the past month, typhoons on the sea have repeatedly attacked the Jiangzhe waters, causing heavy losses to farmers and fishermen along the coast. The Central News Agency reporter specially visited Yuan Jiaji, the director of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration, about this matter. The following is what I was told:</p>
<h3>Investigating the Losses of Fishermen in the Typhoon</h3>
<p>According to him, there have been two typhoons over the Jiangzhe waters this month. Although the observatory issued warnings in advance, it was difficult to inform the fishermen scattered in various places in time, so some were unable to prevent and suffer the disaster of overturning boats or losing their families. This is rare in recent years. After receiving this news, the Bureau immediately sent people to investigate in various places, but because the scope is wide, no detailed report has been received by the Bureau for the time being. It is estimated that the loss this time will be no less than hundreds of thousands. The Bureau has now telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to instruct on relief measures,</p>
<h3>Submitting a Report to the Ministry to Add New Ocean-Protecting Ships</h3>
<p>The reporter further asked how the government will provide relief to the fishermen who have been suffering from the decline of fishing villages in recent years. According to Yuan, the suffering of fishermen is true. The reason is that there is a lack of protection. The aquatic products in the Jiangzhe waters are very rich, but the Japanese often invade the waters and steal fish. If there are strong ocean-protecting ships patrolling in between, the Japanese will not dare to invade and fish, and our fishermen can safely catch fish. In addition, the fish caught by fishermen are transported to the mainland, and they are often extorted. If the government can protect them and allow them to be safely transported to the mainland, the fishermen will definitely reduce their suffering. Although the Bureau now has six ocean-protecting ships, they are not enough for application due to the vast ocean area. It has been approved by the Ministry of Industry to add seven new ships, which can be used around the beginning of next year, so the fishermen will definitely benefit a lot,</p>
<h3>Fisheries Construction Fee Decided to be Collected</h3>
<p>Yuan also said that the fisheries construction fee set by the Bureau is actually to understand the suffering of fishermen and reduce the burden on fishermen, as the main purpose. In the past, the government collected a large number of fishing taxes, and the burden on fishermen was extremely bitter. Now, it is stipulated that the fisheries construction fee will be collected, and the tax rate is low, and it is stipulated that it will be used for the improvement of fisheries, so the fishermen are happy to follow it. Now that the Bureau has decided to collect it, it is hoped that no matter the fishermen or fish merchants, they should all understand this intention, so that the government's plan to seek welfare for the people will not be hindered in the slightest,</p>
<h3>Fisheries Control is Difficult to Achieve Temporarily</h3>
<p>The reporter asked if it is feasible to implement fisheries control as someone suggested. According to him, this matter is difficult to achieve temporarily. One is that the government's funds are stretched, and the other is that China's fisheries are still in their infancy. For the present, the primary task is to protect fishermen, and the government should create a number of fishing boats and prepare new fishing gear, so that fishermen can know what to imitate and gradually improve, which is a top priority, it is said.</p>
<h3>National Goods Movement Exhibition Convened the Judging Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>Establishing Methods to Classify, Evaluate, and Issue Certificates, and the Various Trade Associations Sent Personnel to Participate</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government Orders All Agencies to Remit Aircraft Donations by the Deadline</h3>
<p>All Shall Be Cleared by the End of September</p>
<p>The central government previously handled the entertainment donation and the national salvation aircraft donation of various agencies, and decided to unify the limit of six months. It has been circulated to all its affiliates to comply with the record. Recently, it has been heard that the central government has ordered the State Council to circulate to various agencies all the collected entertainment donations and aircraft donations shall be cleared in full by the end of this month (ie, September). Those who have not collected enough for six months shall continue to remit them monthly. A special notice was issued by the State Council to urge the remittance. It is learned that after Mayor Wu received the order, he immediately ordered all agencies under the jurisdiction of the city to comply with the order. The entertainment donation item was separately ordered by the affiliates to transfer and instruct the local competent collection agencies to follow the deadline, and the aircraft donation has been instructed by the municipal government to comply with the order, it is said.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry  Awards the Ya Pu Er Factory</h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan Also Receives a Citation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry of the National Government, in order to implement the policy of promoting domestic goods, has specially conducted reviews and tests of various well-known domestic products. Recently, the Review Committee for Industrial Awards of the Ministry of Industry decided that the products of the Ya Pu Er Electric Appliance Factory in the electrical industry should be charged according to the first class of goods on national railway transportation for a period of two years, and that national shipping should be allowed to reduce fees by 50% and raw material taxes should be exempted for a period of three years. Mr. Hu Xiyuan, the founder of the factory, was praised for his hard work and struggle, and was awarded a citation.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Actively Plans to Establish a Paper Mill</h3>
<p>The factory site has been determined to be in Qing Tian County, Zhenjiang, with commercial shares of 2 million yuan jointly subscribed by Shen Bao, etc.</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: The paper mill planned by the Ministry of Industry, after determining the capital to be 5 million yuan, 2 million yuan of commercial shares are being jointly raised by the Commercial Press, Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Shi Shi Xin Bao, etc. The 3 million yuan of official shares are being raised by the Ministry of Industry and will be decided soon. According to news from this port, the Ministry has already decided that the factory site will be in Qing Tian County, Zhejiang Province, but for the sake of prudence, it has ordered the Zhejiang Construction Department to conduct a detailed investigation and report on the water level and flow rate of the Xiao Xi River in Qing Tian. It has also sent Li Bixu, a hydraulic expert from Siemens, to Xiao Xi for on-site surveys. It is now learned that the Zhejiang Construction Department has submitted the investigation report on the water level, flow rate, and flow volume of Xiao Xi, but Mr. Li Bixu is still staying there to continue the survey. It is expected that construction of the factory site will begin soon, so that it can be established as soon as possible and the paper-making plan can be realized.</p>
<h3>More Than Ten Counties, Including Shang Bao Jia Tai, Oppose the Imposition of Old Tax Surcharges as Rewards</h3>
<p>Petition to Abolish the Levy of Permanent Tenancy Deed Tax Regulations</p>
<p>The arrears of land tax in Jiangsu Province, from the 16th year of the Republic of China to the 20th year, amounted to 7.45 million yuan in total provincial taxes owed by various counties, plus local surtaxes, totaling approximately 20 million yuan. The Finance Department has specially dispatched old tax clearing committees to various counties to collect, with one-tenth of the actual amount of arrears collected to be used as a bonus, of which the county magistrate receives three-tenths, the committee members receive two and five-tenths, and the staff receive four and five-tenths. This kind of bonus is a great loss to the local finances of various counties. Jia Ding and Bao Shan counties were the first to express their opposition. The reason is that the regular tax and surtax have always been separated. For example, the collection of late payment fines, etc., only adds to the regular tax. Therefore, the one-tenth bonus can only be drawn from the provincial tax. Moreover, the arrears of grain households are the result of ineffective collection. Giving bonuses for collection is tantamount to encouraging the ineffective collection. Therefore, yesterday, they jointly convened a meeting in Shanghai with Song Hu Su Chang and other counties. Representatives from more than ten counties, including Jin Shan, Bao Shan, Jia Ding, Nan Hui, Tai Cang, Kun Shan, Wu Jiang, Chong Ming, Chuan Sha, and Qing Pu, attended, totaling more than 30 people. Liu Shouquan was elected as the temporary chairman. The results of the meeting were: (1) The attending county governments should contact their respective county governments to temporarily suspend the bonus; (2) The attending county governments should jointly send a telegram to the Provincial Party Department, Provincial Government, Finance Department, and Executive Yuan, requesting the cancellation of the surtax bonus method; (3) Schedule a meeting of county representatives to petition the provincial and central authorities. At the end of the meeting, the representative of Tai Cang County proposed that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's implementation of the Permanent Tenancy Deed Tax Regulations was harsh and harmed the people. How should this be expressed? It was decided: (1) The attending counties should send a telegram to the Central Party Department and the Executive Yuan, ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Government to abolish it immediately; (2) Before this regulation is abolished, contact the county government to temporarily suspend the collection; (3) Jointly petition the authorities with representatives from various counties.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau  Adds West Pudong Cross-River Submarine Cables</h3>
<p>Facilitating Telephone Communication Between Pudong and the Northern and Southern Concessions. The Pudong Branch is Expected to be Established by the End of Next Month</p>
<p>The Pudong Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is actively preparing to establish by the end of next month. Cross-border telephones will be removed by the end of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Adding Cross-River Submarine Cables</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau, in order to facilitate telephone communication between Pudong and the northern and southern cities and concessions, began planning the Pudong Branch last month and purchased cross-river submarine cables from the concessions. The Pudong project is nearing completion, but because the original automatic machines are planned to be converted to the city center area, on the tenth of this month, craftsmen were sent to Beijing to collect common-battery telephones from the Ministry. They were transported to Shanghai yesterday and will be replaced within days. In order to facilitate users' quick telephone communication, the bureau plans to lay cross-river submarine cables between Dongmen Road, Dongchang Road, and the Gaochang Temple area, which is expected to be completed around October 20th. The branch is expected to be established by the end of October.</p>
<p>Communication Fees Must Be Canceled  As for cross-border road telephones, the Telephone Bureau, based on the temporary telephone agreement, specially notified all users on August 31st to remove them all before September 30th. According to Liu Gengjing, director of the document section of the bureau, to the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency, after the bureau issued the notice, three weeks have passed. Because the deadline has not yet arrived, no users have requested removal. By the end of this month, the bureau will dismantle all cross-border motors in shops and residences and order the conversion of telephones of this bureau. Due to special circumstances, the cross-border motors of government agencies will be postponed temporarily. If the telephone company can cancel the communication fees, the Telephone Bureau will abolish the restricted communication method.</p>
<h3>The American Fleet Returns to Shanghai from North China</h3>

<h3>Notice of Issuance of Convertible Notes by Zhejiang Local Bank</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations yesterday, stating: According to a letter from the Zhejiang Local Bank, the bank has been specially authorized by the Ministry of Finance to issue convertible notes. It is now scheduled to issue them on October 2, 1933, in three denominations: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, and 10 yuan, and two denominations of auxiliary coins: 1 jiao and 2 jiao. In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, full reserves will be available for cash redemption at any time. In addition to setting up redemption agencies in various districts of the province, it has also entrusted Shanghai Guohua and Donghua Banks to act as redemption agents. Accordingly, the letter is hereby delivered and it is requested that it be forwarded to all industries for universal use, etc.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Ministry of Finance  To Correct Jiangsu Province's Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Original Plan of Not Collecting Business Tax from Brokers Should Be Maintained</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce recently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: (Titles omitted) According to a letter from the Fire Engine Cotton Ginning Industry Association, the association has received reports from its members that the business tax collection bureaus in Songhu, Jinchuan, Huifeng, and other counties have issued notices stating that, according to the instructions of the Jiangsu Finance Department, cotton is a major product of the province and is a short-term business. It should follow the example of Hubei Province and uniformly collect 10 per mille. Temporary merchants who open Zhuang Hao, branches established by manufacturers, and Ya Hang who purchase on behalf of others should be strictly levied. As for brokers and merchants who do not set up Hao and Hang, and who purchase retail and wholesale for resale, whether they sell directly to manufacturers or transport them to other ports, the brokers should pay taxes in accordance with the regulations and must not evade them under any pretext. Personnel will be dispatched to supervise and collect to prevent evasion, etc. Business tax is a national tax, and one item is taxed once, and absolutely no double taxation is allowed. Now, the business tax bureaus, under the pretext of having instructions from the Provincial Department, under the name of cotton short-term, harshly levy its business tax, regardless of merchants' Zhuang Hao, manufacturers' branches, or even brokers' transportation, uniformly levy, and dispatch personnel to supervise, etc. The transfer and sale of goods has no fixed number of times. Now, if the tax is to be levied during the transfer, and the harsh tax is levied repeatedly, which is more severe than the Likin tax, and one item is taxed several times, it is an illegal collection of tax. Cotton farmers and merchants in cotton-producing areas, hearing this, are running around in panic and are extremely uneasy. If it is implemented, not only will it violate the central government's purpose of revitalizing the rural areas, but it will also increase the burden on the people. In addition, cotton production has declined in recent years, rural areas have collapsed, and the failure of the cotton yarn industry has been heard from time to time. Given the situation of the cotton industry's downturn, how can it bear this heavy taxation? Although the work and business locations of the association's members are in the counties bordering the urban area, the general office is in the urban area. Therefore, it is specially submitted, and it is earnestly requested that your association, mindful of the difficulties of merchants, forward it to the Ministry of the Executive Yuan and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and promptly order the Jiangsu Finance Department to stop it, so as to comply with the law and alleviate the suffering of Jiangsu merchants. The City Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits. This matter is the same as the case in which the association telegraphed in June to request your ministry to stop the Hengyi Sheng Silk Thread Hao, established by the Rugao County Business Tax Bureau, from collecting business tax from its branch. The ministry issued approval number 2863 on July 3, stating: Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Provisional Regulations, Article 20, which stipulates that temporary Zhuang Hao, who purchase goods and transport them to other places, should uniformly collect business tax, etc. Therefore, the ministry's approval of the previously exempted business tax for those who only buy but do not sell has been changed. Therefore, the point of contention in this case is whether the previously approved clause is consistent with the provisions of the Business Tax Law decided by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. The first question is whether the point of contention is the question of whether that stipulation is legally sound. According to Article 1 of the same law, business tax should be levied on businesses. The definition of "businesses" is stipulated in Article 3 of the same law. According to the provisions of that article, all of the following five conditions must be met to be called a business: (1) store, (2) business person's residence, (3) business capital, (4) business income, and (5) business net income. The Zhuang Ke who open when purchasing goods do not meet the conditions of 3, 4, and 5, and according to law, they cannot be called a business, and there is no possibility of collecting business tax from them. The business tax does not collect from merchants, which is the opposite of the Likin tax and goods tax, which only collect from merchants and not from resident merchants. If the business tax is levied twice, it is a clear violation of the tax law. Based on the above reasons, the Ministry should amend Article 20 of the recently approved Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Law and maintain the original plan of not collecting business tax from Zhuang Ke, which is to maintain the spirit of Article 5, so that the burden is equal and there is no double taxation. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits.</p>
<h3>Three Types of Government Bonds To Be Drawn Regularly</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance of the National Government, Song Ziwen, issued Announcement No. 8, stating: For the announcement, the seventh principal repayment of the 20th Year of the Republic of China Short-Term Financial Bonds, the third principal repayment of the 20th Year of the Republic of China Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Bonds, and the thirteenth principal repayment of the 18th Year of the Republic of China Disarmament Bonds will all be drawn on October 5 at the Shanghai Banking Association. For all bonds drawn, such as the 20th Year Short-Term Financial Bonds and the 20th Year Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Bonds, the payments will begin on October 15. For the 18th Year Disarmament Bonds, the payments will begin on October 21. In addition to the 20th Year Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Bonds, which are paid by the four banks of Central China, Jiaotong, and Guohuo in various places, the remainder are still paid by the three banks of Central China and Jiaotong. Lest it is not widely known, this is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County District Chiefs Meeting</h3>

<h3>Employees of Jardine Matheson's Various Ships Request a Salary Increase</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The Maoban employees of various ships of Jardine Matheson, because the company's treatment is meager and the salaries they receive cannot maintain their lives, negotiated with the company through representatives of the Shipping Mutual Aid Association, requesting a salary increase. It is learned that the company has not shown sincerity in repeatedly sending personnel to negotiate with the association. The employees of the various ships, due to the pressure of life, can no longer tolerate it. The Shipping Mutual Aid Association, in view of the urgency of the situation, specially convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was decided to appease the employees of the various ships on the one hand, and not to take drastic actions. On the other hand, representatives will be sent again to earnestly negotiate with the company. If the company still cannot accept it, it will seek further countermeasures.</p>
<h3>No Handling Fee for Ya Hang Obtaining a License</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Fruit and Land Goods Industry stating that the director of the Ya Tax Office charges double the prescribed amount for newly established Ya Hang to apply for a license, which merchants and people cannot afford.

<h3>Police at the South Station Inspect Goods</h3>
<p>Those Without Invoices Are Detained  Causing Merchants to Complain</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway South Station has always been inspected by the Superintendent Office stationed at the station by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with the police chief of the Gaochang Temple branch of the Second District, to implement the inspection of prohibited items and privately carried military supplies, etc. It is now learned that the District Chief Li of the Second District Headquarters has recently added two police officers from the District Headquarters to the station for inspection. When passengers are found carrying items without invoices, the goods are detained. Most passengers who purchase goods do not take invoices because they are their own items and are not purchased on behalf of others. The other day, a villager who purchased some leftover cloth pieces was detained because he had no invoice. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, two pieces of rubber overshoes of Yihua Xiang in Nanxingqiao, Hangzhou, transported by Shenda Transportation Company on behalf of a customer, were about a hundred pairs, which were shipped by Shanghai merchant Kefade. The company issued a receipt for the goods to the station, but were detained by the police. The police station and personnel from the company, etc., informed him of the truth, but the policeman refused and still detained the goods and sent them to the Second District Headquarters for verification. However, passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway complained about it. Later, the Railway Bureau requested that the Municipal Public Security Bureau be requested to order the district to cancel the above-mentioned measures to avoid disturbing passengers and ensure safety.</p>

<h3>The Name of the Western Corpse in the Abandoned House in West Shanghai Has Been Ascertained</h3>
<p>It is the Australian Pu Latte Who Served in the Public Works Bureau. He Froze to Death After Drinking Too Much Alcohol and Falling Asleep.</p>
<p>His Wife and Daughter Are Now Far Away in Australia</p>
<p>The Mainland News reports that the foreign remains found on Friday afternoon at No. 830 Jing An Temple Road have now been identified as Mr. Pu Latte, who previously served in the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau. He was 56 years old and a native of Australia. He has been living in Shanghai for a long time and is quite well-known. Therefore, the police do not suspect any foul play. It is probably because he drank too much alcohol on February 10 of this year and went to the house to sleep. Pu used to live in the house. At that time, he was mentally unclear and thought it was still his residence. There were originally heating pipes in the room, but Pu also forgot that there were no residents in the room and the heating had stopped. Therefore, he lay on the ground close to the heating pipe. At that time, the weather was very cold, and he was frozen to death in his sleep because he was drunk and unconscious. His clothes were not messy, his left hand was inserted into his coat pocket, and his right arm was bent under his head to replace a pillow. In his coat pocket, there were two five-yuan bills, one ten-yuan bill, several small silver coins, a box of paper cigarettes, a pipe, a bag of tobacco, a key, a handle, a pair of glasses, several business cards, a small bottle of medicine, a private letter, and a telegram from his daughter in Australia, asking for an urgent remittance of 150 pounds of English gold. Pu originally lived in the house with his wife, who ran a boarding house there for several years. The boarding house closed on October 1 of last year, and the couple moved to a hotel. In December, his wife returned to Australia to meet her married daughter. Pu became ill in January of this year and was treated at Baolong Hospital. He was discharged on February 9 and returned to his hotel, spent the night, and disappeared the next day. Later, his friend reported to the police to search for him, but he was never found. Pu came to China many years ago, and his service in the Public Works Bureau was still 18 years ago.</p>

<h3>The Theater Bandit Jiang Henghua Was Arrested in Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>The Source of Sun Shaotang's Gun  His Confession After the Arrest Is Still Cunning</p>
<p>In mid-April of this year, detectives of the French Concession intercepted a notorious bandit, Sun Shaotang, who resisted arrest and had a history of committing crimes, while inspecting pedestrians on Kai Zi Er Road in the concession. He has now been convicted. However, when the police inquired about the source of the gun from the suspect, he claimed that it was Jiang Henghua, a notorious bandit in Taihu Lake (nicknamed Lao Jiang, also known as Jiang Hengfa), who instructed his daughter-in-law to bring it to Shanghai to provide them with weapons for committing crimes. However, after repeated efforts by the police to investigate Jiang's whereabouts, he could not be arrested because Jiang was hiding in the Taihu Mountain. It was not until yesterday morning that Jin Jiulin, superintendent of the French Concession Police, detectives Zhang Ziying, deputy detective Zhou Bingcheng, detectives Cai Jinzhang, Qin Youyu, etc., received a confidential report that Jiang had sneaked into Shanghai and was hiding at No. 309, Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road. Superintendent Jin, etc., immediately went to the address fully armed and arrested Jiang on the spot. He was taken to the police station. After a strict interrogation by the police chief, he claimed to be 55 years old and from Haizhou. The rest of his words were cunning. After the interrogation, he was ordered to be detained, awaiting transfer to the Second Special District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior Informs the City Government  To Strictly Prohibit Supernatural and Strange Small Books</h3>
<p>Order the Public Security Bureau to Search and Burn Them</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior recently investigated small bookstores in various places that issue supernatural and superstitious small books. The general ignorant citizens and children are easily bewitched by reading them. Therefore, yesterday, it informed the Municipal Government to strictly prohibit them. The original text is as follows: (Children's and popular books and paintings have an extremely important impact on the security, culture, customs, and ideology of the country and society. Recently, it has been found that booksellers and small stalls in various ports compile small books with supernatural, strange, obscene words and fabricated stories. The upper part is a picture, and the lower part is described with simple words. The general ignorant children and people with little literacy like to buy and read them, and the impact is not only to degrade the will of young people, but also to harm the national customs and ideology. The record that publications must not harm good customs is strictly restricted by Article 19, Paragraph 4 of the Publication Law. The ministry previously approved the case sent by the Beijing Municipal Government for investigation and seizure of such books and paintings, and transferred it to the ministry for investigation and handling. It was ordered to be banned in the archives, but unscrupulous merchants took advantage of the opportunity for profit, ignoring the order. If the ban is not re-emphasized and strictly suppressed, how can the grain and the chaff be distinguished and the customs be corrected? In addition to distributing them, the relevant authorities are notified to investigate and handle them, order the Public Security Bureau to post announcements so that the public is aware, and supervise its subordinates to thoroughly search for such books and paintings and similar popular publications, and confiscate and burn them to uphold the law and prevent their circulation. Please report the handling situation.</p>
<p>The Tenants' Association of Huadefang, Lane 551, reports: (Our association was established in 1931, because the China Business Company increased the rent, and a contract was signed that the rent would not be increased within four years, but the increase in water prices was not included. Both parties agreed to sign a contract. On January 28, 1932, the China Business Company transferred it to the Jingan Company. After the company took over, it continued to validate the contract signed by the China Business Company before. In July of that year, the water company suddenly increased water charges, causing a boiling throughout the city. Our Fang repeatedly cut off water, and the tenants were suddenly worried. The police were immediately reported and personnel were sent to open the water. On the one hand, personnel were sent to ask the owner to add a small amount. After repeated consultations, the tenants took responsibility for the water fee increase of one yuan, but the owner firmly refused to admit it. The contract signed by the China Business Company has not yet expired, and the rent should not be increased without authorization. Therefore, under the pretext of the increase in water prices, six yuan and four cents per month were added, but the tenants in this Fang are all poor workers, how can they bear this heavy water fee? It could not be resolved for a while. From July to the end of April this year, the Jingan Company notified that the water fee for the past ten months should be increased by four yuan and six jiao per room, and five yuan and six jiao per storefront. Half of the tenants have paid the arrears of water fees in full, and the other half have to pay them gradually because they are poor. However, the rent collector Feng Maotang claimed that if they did not pay again, the water would be cut off. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th of this month, the water company sent a Western employee to turn off the water, because the owner owed water fees, and the half of the arrears of water fees collected were arbitrarily not paid. The company listened to cutting off the water, but water and fire are the lives of the people and cannot be without them for a moment. The water was cut off for two days. The landlord's oppression of the tenants could not be more than this. The tenants suffered this unexpected pain and could not remain silent. They had to request</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo to Expand Facilities and Construct New Enclosures</h3>
<p>Large Animal Houses to Be Built for Bears and Leopards; Indian Giant Elephant Expected Next Month</p>
<p>Since its opening, the Shanghai Municipal Zoo has been quite praised by the people of Shanghai. However, due to limited funds, the facilities have not been entirely perfect, leading to incidents like the escape of a large bear, which greatly alarmed visitors. Now, the director of the zoo, Shen Xiangrui, in order to remedy the situation and prevent future incidents, has specifically requested the Municipal Education Bureau to allocate funds for expanding facilities and constructing large animal enclosures, etc. The estimated cost is over 6,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Construction of New Large Animal Enclosures</h3>
<p>According to Director Shen of the zoo, speaking to a reporter from the Guomin News Agency yesterday, the zoo currently has two large animal enclosures, housing lions and tigers. Originally, there were plans to build large animal enclosures for bears and leopards as well, but due to limited funds at the time, they could not be built simultaneously. Therefore, they were temporarily placed in small animal enclosures. The construction and facilities were not perfect, and not very safe, resulting in incidents such as the bear's escape. Now, to remedy this, it is planned to build two more enclosures, one for bears and one for leopards, at an estimated cost of over 4,000 yuan. In addition, each animal enclosure needs to be equipped with a tap for running water to facilitate cleaning. This expense is estimated to be over 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Building Thatched Pavilions and Widening Paths</h3>
<p>The zoo now plans to build a large thatched pavilion in front of the aquatic animal enclosures, covering an area of six square zhang, for visitors to rest. The construction cost is estimated to be over 300 yuan. Furthermore, the original garden paths will be widened to twenty square zhang, requiring over 200 yuan. The edges of the pond will be reinforced with wooden revetments for a total length of over 30 zhang, costing 900 yuan. The total cost of the above construction is over 6,400 yuan, and the request has already been submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval before proceeding with the work.</p>
<h3>Indian Elephant Arriving Next Month</h3>
<p>The zoo's purchase of a giant elephant has been repeatedly unsuccessful due to disagreements over price. Now, through an introduction, a giant elephant has been ordered from India, priced at around 3,000 yuan, and is expected to arrive next month. At the latest, it will definitely be shipped to Shanghai in November. Preparations are already underway for the construction of feeding areas and enclosures to accommodate it upon arrival.</p>
<h3>Hibiscus Competition Postponed</h3>
<p>The first Hibiscus and Singing Bird Competition planned by the zoo has been approved by the Education Bureau. It was originally scheduled to be held on November 12th at the Municipal Public Education Hall. However, it has been learned that the Hibiscus birds will not be in their singing season during November, so it is proposed to postpone it slightly. Registration for bird owners will now begin on October 1st, with a limit of one bird per species. Visitors will be charged 10 cents per person to limit the number of attendees.</p>
<h3>Ticket Revenue Fully Submitted to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>When the zoo first opened, citizens were very curious and eager to visit, with daily visitors exceeding 10,000. Even though each person was only charged six copper coins, the daily ticket revenue could reach 500 to 600 yuan. Now, after being open for a while, the average daily number of visitors is still over a thousand, generating about 40 to 50 yuan in revenue. It is estimated that since opening, the total ticket revenue has been over 5,000 yuan. This money has all been handed over to the Municipal Education Bureau for transfer to the Municipal Government. Now, the funds for construction are being requested from the Municipal Government again to demonstrate the unified management of municipal funds.</p>

<h3>Water Meter Billing Should Not Increase the Burden on Poor Households</h3>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Asks the Public Works Department to Implement This Principle; Disputes Arise Again Between Landlords and Tenants in Ward Road Residences</p>
<p>The dispute over increased water rates in this city has been raging for months, and was only temporarily resolved in early April. Recently, landlords in Ward Road residences, citing the increase in water rates, have been charging tenants hefty fees each month. The tenant association of these residences has specifically written to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to inquire about the method of calculating water rates. After receiving the letter, the Taxpayers' Association, in addition to sending a letter to the association explaining the trial measures for water rates implemented from April 1st, also sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting them to investigate and ensure the implementation of the principle of not increasing the burden on poor households. The relevant excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Works Department: We are deeply grateful for your esteemed department's dedication to public service. Furthermore, water rates have increased again after May of this year. According to a letter from Mr. Jing An, the water rates are increased by more than 4 yuan and 30 cents per month for each storefront, and 3 yuan and 20 cents per month for each residential unit. Given that the monthly rent for storefronts in Ward Road Residences is 23 yuan and the rent for residential units is 17 yuan, the sudden increase in a large amount of water fees is unbearable for poor tenants. Has the water rate issue been resolved after May of this year? According to the rent price of our residences, how much should the water rate be increased? Please provide a detailed reply so that we can negotiate with the landlords. We hereby request your bureau to investigate and implement the principle of not increasing the burden on poor households when calculating water fees using meters. Respectfully, to the General Manager of the Shanghai International Settlement Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Reply to the Tenant Association: We have carefully read your letter of September 20th regarding the water company cutting off the water supply due to the landlords' failure to pay water fees. It is indeed unreasonable to cut off the water supply, which is essential for daily life. According to the trial measures for water rates implemented from April 1st: (1) For a monthly rent of 17 yuan, the basic water usage is 4,000 gallons per month, costing 1 yuan and 31 cents in national currency. If this amount is exceeded, the cost is 3 cents and 27 li per thousand gallons. (2) For a monthly rent of 23 yuan, the basic water usage is 4,500 gallons per month, costing 1 yuan and 69 cents in national currency. If this amount is exceeded, the cost is 3 cents and 76 li per thousand gallons. According to the contract with the landlord, which stipulates that water rate increases will not result in rent increases, the landlord should bear the water costs of 1 yuan, 27 cents, and 5 li per month for each residential unit, and 1 yuan, 72 cents, and 5 li per month for each storefront. The remainder should be borne by the tenants, and there is absolutely no reason to refuse to bear this cost. If the amount of water fees the landlord intends to increase exceeds the actual water fees paid, it is essentially an increase in rent, which is contrary to the contract. If it is less than the water fees, it is the landlord's generosity. To determine the actual situation, it is necessary to check the monthly water bills. This association suggests that the monthly water bills be made public by the landlord. After deducting the water fees that the landlord should bear, the remaining amount should be borne by the residential and storefront tenants in proportion to their rent. Water fees for non-domestic use, such as tiger stoves and tofu shops, should be reasonably assessed and borne by the users. However, the following matters must also be noted: 1. Please ask the landlord to cooperate closely with the water company and pay attention to water pipe leaks. 2. Please ask tenants to strictly conserve and avoid wasting water. We hereby reply for your reference. Respectfully, to the Tenant Association of Ward Road Residences.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Drugs Seized by National Post Offices</h3>
<p>The Anti-Smoking Committee prepared a report on the seizure of contraband drugs by national post offices last year for the League of Nations.

<h3>Chemical Raw Materials Industry Association Establishes Business Office</h3>
<p>Appoints Wang Honghui as Director</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Industry Association, recognizing that the recent influx of foreign raw materials into the market and the outflow of money are immeasurable, has established a United Business Office for the Chemical Raw Materials Industry at No. 17 Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, in the hope of concentrating efforts to promote domestic products and actively resist foreign goods. A contract has been signed with Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Co., Ltd. to first promote domestically produced sulfuric acid. Wang Honghui has been appointed as director, and Xie Zhongfu, Yu Xingcun, Chen Wenkui, Zhang Heming, Dong Laicun, Lin Fengfu, and Liang Shaokun have been appointed as committee members to be responsible for handling all matters. It is scheduled to officially begin operations on October 1st.</p>
<h3>Animal Protection Association Cares for Birds in Jingkou</h3>
<p>Requests County Government to Stop Hunters from Slaughtering</p>
<p>The China Animal Protection Association, concerned about the slaughter of birds in the reed marshes of Jingkou Township, has specifically requested the Shanghai County Government to prohibit the practice. The petition states: "Regarding the matter of relaying a request based on the situation, according to a report from citizens Qian Xuanqing and others from Jingkou Township, Second District, Shanghai County, the area is located along the Huangpu River, with vast reed marshes covering hundreds of miles. Tens of thousands of birds fly and sing among them, creating a natural symphony. Recently, ignorant hunters have colluded with foolish villagers to indiscriminately hunt and kill them, leaving almost none alive. It is heartbreaking to witness. We request that measures be taken to stop this." After investigation, it has been found that the hunters in the area are cruel and have various methods of hunting. Moreover, greedy villagers assist them, using firearms, hawks, hooks, nets, and other tools to target creatures in the sky, on the ground, in the marshes, and under the trees, leaving them nowhere to escape. The most tragic thing is that young birds waiting to be fed, and small birds unable to fly, are wounded and die, crying out in sorrow, filling the scene with desolation and the air with sounds of killing. It is not only that vulnerable creatures are killed instantly, but the beautiful reed marshes are also trampled upon. As the ancients taught, there is a time for entering the mountains and forests. This applies even to felling trees, let alone to birds and animals. Therefore, we respectfully submit this report to Your Honor, earnestly requesting that you order your subordinates to strictly prohibit this practice, not only to benefit living creatures but also to allow the villagers in the area to hear less of the sounds of moaning and killing, and to reduce their greed and cruelty. This would be a truly virtuous act."</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Industry Asks Public Works Department to Collect Donations According to Regulations</h3>
<p>Requests That Donations Continue to Be Collected at Two Per Thousand According to Original Regulations; Will Not Pay Until a Concrete Response Is Received</p>
<p>The pawnshop industry in the Shanghai International Settlement held a joint meeting of new and old members yesterday to discuss the request to the Public Works Department to reinstate the original regulations for checking pawned goods and collecting donations at a rate of two per thousand. Over 40 pawnshops attended, and the following resolutions were reached: (1) The Public Works Department's change to the original regulations for collecting donations on pawned goods has greatly increased the burden on the industry. Therefore, it is firmly requested that payments will not be made until a concrete response is received from the department. (2) The over 10,000 yuan in donations that were overcollected by the Public Works Department has been listed and sent to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting that the Public Works Department approve the deduction of the overcollected donations from the winter season, with each pawnshop verifying the amount to be deducted. Any remaining amount will be paid in addition. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpayers' Association will be requested to vigorously negotiate until the goal is achieved.</p>
<h3>(September 18th) Products from the Home Industry Cooperative Are Selling Well</h3>
<p>The Home Industry Cooperative is a pioneer in the domestic goods industry. Its newly opened distribution center on Nanjing Road has been operating for four months, and its arrangements are magnificent and luxurious, making it the most modern in Shanghai.

Those who need to purchase cosmetics and all kinds of applicable goods should not miss this good opportunity.</p>

<h3>An Unexpected Incident for Lin Wenbing and His Wife</h3>
<p>丨Caused by Mistreating Her Younger Sister丨</p>
<p>Lin's Wife Detained After Childbirth, Infant Dies Tragically; Police Lawyer Righteously Pays the Fine</p>
<p>Lin Wenbing, from Changzhou, and his wife, Ms. Fang, live at No. 3801, another house on Roberts Road, Shanghai West. Ms. Lin's younger sister, Gengui, who is only eight years old, depends on them for her livelihood. At 7:00 AM on the 20th of this month, Ms. Fang severely reprimanded her sister for daring to stay out for two nights without returning. After she returned home, she used a bamboo strip as a switch and struck Gengui on the head and face. Unable to bear the pain, she wailed loudly, and the sound reached the neighbors. The nearby patrolman went to investigate and saw that Gengui had sustained minor injuries from the beating. When he questioned Lin Wenbing and his wife, they both admitted to the beating. The patrolman arrested them both. At the time, Ms. Fang had just given birth four days prior, and her physical condition was very weak. However, since she had been arrested, she had no choice but to carry her infant with her to the police station. After questioning them, the police chief decided to file a lawsuit against Lin Wenbing and Lin Fang for assault. Lin Wenbing was ordered to be detained, and Ms. Fang was transferred to the women's prison of the First Special District District Court for detention. The infant, who had just been born, was also imprisoned with her mother. The Lin family had no other relatives besides the couple, so Gengui was temporarily without support and was taken care of by the police station. The next day, the 21st, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special Court brought Lin Wenbing and his wife to court for trial. Ms. Fang, being a new mother, became increasingly depressed and physically weak after being detained for a day and a night. During the trial, her feet were trembling, and the infant in her arms was pale. Many onlookers felt sorry for her. However, the trial could not be concluded that day, and Judge Wu ordered a continuation of the trial on the 23rd. The two defendants were returned to custody separately. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd, the infant died. Yesterday morning, when the continuation of the trial was due, Judge Wu Tingqi brought the two defendants to court again for questioning and sentenced each of them to a fine of ten yuan. The number of days of detention was allowed to offset the fine at two yuan per day. If the two had already been detained for five full days at the time of sentencing, the fine would be completely offset, and they could regain their freedom. However, at the time of sentencing, they had only been detained for three days, which could only offset six yuan of the fine. If they wanted to be released immediately, they would have to pay an additional four yuan each, otherwise, they would have to continue to be detained for two more days at a rate of two yuan per day. However, the Lins were poor and had no money to pay the fine. If they were to be detained again, the police station did not want to be responsible for Gengui's accommodation. Therefore, although the case was minor, it was difficult to find a solution that satisfied everyone. In the end, the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, out of compassion, spent eight yuan to give to Lin Wenbing and his wife, who immediately paid the fine in court and were released. They then took Gengui home. However, the new mother has already suffered greatly.</p>
<h3>Luo Wenxuan Lectures on Economic Trends in Various Countries</h3>
<p>The Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA specifically invited Mr. Luo Wenxuan of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Institute to lecture on (Economic Trends in Various Countries After the London Conference) last night. Jin Shou of the Bingxun Stenography Agency provided stenographic services. The audience was very enthusiastic. Here is an excerpt of his speech: In order to understand the economic trends in various countries after the London Conference, it is necessary to first understand the various situations before and after the World Economic Conference and why the Economic Conference was held. Since the United States, known as the "Golden Country," first experienced a stock market panic in 1929, the world economic panic has gradually been exposed. It is estimated that there are about 12 million unemployed people in the United States. Although there are no statistics in China, there are at least 30 million. Japan has more than 400,000, but in reality, there are no less than 2 million. Various capitalist countries have tried many methods, but none have been effective, such as increasing tariffs and restricting the import of foreign goods. As a result, the entire world is experiencing a panic of stagnant goods. Therefore, everyone agreed to hold the World Economic Conference this year. A total of 63 countries participated, but each country held selfish and self-interested views. Countries with the gold standard and countries without the gold standard formed two groups, and the two sides confronted each other and could not be reconciled. In the conference, the currency issue could not be resolved from beginning to end. The United States first raised the issue of war debts, believing that the Economic Conference could not be resolved without resolving the war debts. Therefore, the conference encountered a major obstacle. Since 1929, various countries have had too much inventory, mostly due to falling prices. In short, this conference can be said to have been without results. Even if the conference continues, it is feared that it will only fail. But what is the trend after the conference? The United States is now using a kind of economic revolution to try its best to remedy the dead end of capitalism, and the so-called policy of currency inflation is being used to increase prices, increase wages, and shorten working hours to open up a new situation. Also, countries such as the United Kingdom are doing their best to raise tariffs in colonies such as India and Canada to resist foreign goods and organize a kind of economic power. In addition, Japan is moving all its goods to China, but in fact, the goods still cannot be sold as they should be. It is actively expanding its navy and army, and using the power of the navy and army to maintain the market for its goods. At the current time when capitalism is dying, there are obvious conflicts between the United States and Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, and the United Kingdom and Japan. Now, from all aspects, we have come to a conclusion: the failure of the World Economic Conference is the result of the unequal division of spoils among the imperialists. Therefore, in the future, under capitalism, only war can solve the panic and fire is the only way.</p>
<h3>Zheng Tonghe Speaks on the Native Cloth Movement and Rescuing the Nation from Disaster</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Native Cloth Movement Conference</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Native Cloth Movement Conference in this city invited two speakers: Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and Zheng Tonghe, Principal of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School. Mr. Chu was summoned to Beijing by telegram from the Executive Yuan and cancelled his speech at the last minute. Instead, Mr. Zheng Tonghe, an educator who wears native cloth, spoke on the very painful issue of using economics to rescue the nation from disaster. The entire audience was deeply moved. Here is a summary of his speech:</p>
<h3>The National Crisis Is Increasingly Urgent</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng briefly stated that at this time when the national crisis is increasingly urgent, the suffering of the people is even greater than that of the people of a fallen nation. The entire country, from top to bottom, should strive to save the nation. The way to save the nation is to first avoid economic invasion. To avoid economic invasion, we must promote domestic goods and reject foreign goods. From the perspective of national power, we have already lost territory such as the four northeastern provinces. Who can guarantee their recovery? Even those that have not been lost, such as the provinces of Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang, are all facing imminent crises. Cultural backwardness, economic bankruptcy, rural decline, and the suffering of the people, and the recent Yellow River flood, which has caused death and displacement and threatens the lifeblood of the nation, what are the causes of this? I believe that there are two main reasons: (1) the economic aggression of imperialism, and (2) the result of the nation's own degeneration and lack of competitiveness. One hundred years ago, our country relied on men farming and women weaving. We had no worries about food and clothing, and we were self-sufficient and did not rely on others. The economic situation of farmers was quite prosperous, and the country was therefore at peace. Since the opening of overseas transportation and the Opium War, foreign goods have poured in like a tide, and the Chinese people have competed to buy foreign goods and abandon domestic products. Family handicrafts have stagnated, and as a result, money has flowed out, and the economic foundation has been bankrupt.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Statistics</h3>
<p>In the last sixty-four years, imports have been 254,872,767,200 yuan, roughly 2500 million yuan. Exports were only 194,200,000,000 yuan. The difference is 600 million yuan. Every one of the 400 million people in the country would have to pay 150 yuan. In the past, a family of five, with the man farming and the woman weaving, lived in peace and security. Now that they can suddenly produce nothing, the average family of five bears an additional burden of about 800 yuan. How can such an economy not be bankrupt? Conversely, if we are not subjected to economic aggression by foreigners, then each person can earn 800 yuan per year. Comparing the two is heartbreaking. According to customs trade reports, the import surplus in the 19th year of the Republic was 450,000,000 Customs Taels, the import surplus in the 20th year was 510,000,000 Customs Taels, and the import surplus in the 21st year was 560,000,000 Customs Taels. A loss of 320 million yuan in one year. How much wealth does the country have to withstand such losses? Therefore, even just from an economic point of view, it is enough to cause the country to fall. The current state of the Chinese countryside is indescribable. Farmers in the countryside of Yixing who have no food to eat are eating soil and bark. Last year, when there was heavy snow in northern Anhui, 150 families starved to death at the same time. This year, rice is so cheap, but farmers have no money to buy it. Even those who are poor and want to borrow a few copper coins cannot do so. Farmers in Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi who cannot make a living are fleeing elsewhere, and some have even become bandits.</p>
<h3>How to Stabilize Life</h3>
<p>The reason for this is that the economy cannot be independent, foreign goods sell well, and domestic products decline. The only important task for saving the country in the future is to stabilize the lives of the people. To stabilize the lives of the people, the people themselves must first resist foreign goods and buy domestic products. The most important of domestic products is native cloth. Here, we have two major hopes for our compatriots: (1) Everyone should not just talk about it, but everyone should actually wear native cloth. (2) Native cloth industry and commerce must quickly find ways to improve so that they can actually be cheap and of good quality. Today, if we want to restore the Chinese economy and prevent our descendants from becoming slaves of a fallen nation, we must start by saving the bankrupt rural economy. To save the bankrupt rural economy, we must start with everyone being willing to wear native cloth.</p>
<h3>Many Recreational Performances</h3>
<p>After Mr. Zheng's speech, there were many recreational performances, such as various performances by Shanghai Girls' Middle School, Chenxi Girls' Middle School, Yizhi Society, and Jingqin School, as well as a spectacular magic show by guest Mr. Li Junzhi, which garnered a lot of applause. Yesterday was a Sunday, and there were many people who came to visit and listen to the speeches.</p>
<h3>Visiting Factories Founded by Liu Hongsheng</h3>
<p>At the request of the members of the China Merchants Bureau Manager Liu Hongsheng and the Communications Alumni Club, they were invited to visit the Yingchang Match Factory, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, and Shanghai Cement Factory in Pudong and Longhua, all planned and managed by Liu. About 200 people went, including Huang Naishu, Mo Heng, and Xu Yuanfang. They departed from the Customs Wharf at 10:00 AM by the (Clock) launch, first arriving at Lujia Ferry in Pudong to visit the Yingchang Match Factory.</p>
<p>Yingchang Matches The Yingchang Factory has a history of more than 20 years. The factory buildings are old-style single-story structures, with a large area of more than 20 acres and more than 500 factory rooms. Inside, various machines are installed, and male and female workers are working diligently. Heavy machinery is managed by male workers, who are fewer in number. The whole factory has 458 female workers, while there are only 289 male workers. The female workers' job is doing manual work. Their skills are proficient, and their movements are surprisingly fast. However, the monotonous work simply makes them mechanized. The factory's scale is not large, but directly and indirectly, there are thousands of people who depend on it for their livelihood. Leaving Yingchang, they boarded a boat and landed at Zhoujia Wharf, walking along the river piled with coal blocks and coal dross, which is the stacking yard for the raw materials of Zhonghua Coal Briquette. The high and black chimney is a landmark.</p>
<p>Zhanghua Woolen Mill The entire machinery power source of Zhanghua Woolen Mill originates from a huge gear, transmitting power to each machine. The wool is washed, dried, fluffed, and spun into fine yarn, then woven into serge, tweed, etc. After lunch at the Zhanghua Factory, they went to the Zhonghua Coal Briquette Factory. Coal briquettes are made by burning white coal dross and yellow mud. The manufacturing process is very simple, using a large machine that continuously completes each part of the work. Few workers are needed to manage it. All that is seen is that the granular coal dross enters from one end, is mixed with yellow mud, molded, and dried, and at the other end, it becomes shiny balls one by one. It is said that the equipment of that factory is second to none in the Far East.</p>
<p>Huafeng Enamelware The Huafeng Enamelware Factory is also nearby. Upon entering, led by staff, they arrived at the apprentice dormitory. It is said that it is difficult to train adult workers, and they already have bad habits, so the factory adopts an apprentice system, training them for three years before they enter the factory. Young people are recruited from orphanages or poor families and trained. There are now more than 200 of them. They then visited various machines in the factory, where steel sheets are scraped, pressed into concave shapes, crimped, coated with porcelain powder, and dried, then sprayed with colorful patterns. Most of the products are washbasins, but there are also many water cups and food boxes.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cement The Shanghai Cement Factory is in Longhua, near the wharf, which are two rows of cement buildings, namely the cement warehouses. Behind them is a long row of factory buildings. In front, there is a wooden platform and a bridge, accessible by light railways. Carts of white stones are transported from the edge of Taihu Lake, and soil is dug up from the Huangpu River, transported up, and poured into the machine mouth. It is then ground into powder by gears and rollers, and then sent to the kiln to be burned into cement. There are two kilns, each more than 50 meters long, producing 1,500 to 1,600 barrels per day. After the visit, on the way back to Shanghai, they stopped at the Yitaixing South Wharf. Behind the neat 2,000-foot-long wharf are rows of warehouses, which are an important part of the prosperous industry and commerce. By the time they arrived at the Shanghai Customs Wharf, it was already 6 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Newlyweds' Car Crashes into Rib Stall</h3>
<p>Compensation of Five Dollars Settled</p>
<p>The daughter of a tenant on the upper floor of the Qiasheng Coal Shop on Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession was married yesterday. The husband's surname is He. At 5:50 PM, the young couple were riding in a No. 6051 black-and-white-lettered dark green sedan car, speeding to the intersection of Xizilaihuo Street, intending to stop, resulting in overturning a fried pork chop and rice cake stand on the sidewalk there. In an instant, bowls, cups, pots, and a full pot of boiling oil all fell to the ground. Amidst the clatter, the stallholder was greatly startled, and the groom and bride in the car were stopped by the stallholder, who demanded compensation for the loss. A patrolling constable noticed it and brought them to the police station. Later, the groom agreed to compensate for the loss of five dollars, settling the matter.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Tragically Dies Under Owner's Car The Constable is Chinese, the Car Owner is Western</h3>
<p>Liu Xuehai, a Tianjin native residing in a pavilion room at No. 5 Yuqing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, is currently 48 years old. He serves as Constable No. 120 at the French Concession Police Station, assigned to guard the gate and garden of a Westerner's residence on Avenue Dubail. Yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, he was returning home from his shift, walking along Avenue Dubail, when he encountered his Westerner master's car speeding towards him. Liu was unable to avoid it and was knocked down, suffering head injuries with incessant bleeding from both ears. Upon learning of this, the police sent him to Guangci Hospital, but he died at noon due to his injuries. The hospital notified the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for an autopsy, awaiting a court inspection today.</p>
<h3>Han Guangda Abducts and Adulterates with a Married Woman</h3>
<p>Xu Yongkang, residing at No. 171 Qingyun Road, Zhabei, has a wife named Zhu Lanying, 22 years old. She had an affair with Han Guangda, who lived in the same building. Recently, Han abducted and hid her without a trace. Xu reported this to the Fifth District Police Station, who arrested Han. Han confessed that Zhu Lanying was hidden in Room 34 of the Danghu Inn on Shanxi Road. The police station dispatched officers, along with Chinese and foreign detectives from the jurisdiction's police station, who rushed to the address, found Zhu Lanying, and escorted her to Judge Feng of the First Special District Local Court for preliminary interrogation. She was then handed over to the representative of the Fifth District to be taken back for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Shop Assistant Convicted of Misappropriating Customer Accounts</h3>
<p>Zhou Wending, a Shaoxing native working as a shop assistant at Jinchangxiang Hardware Store at No. 49 Broadway Road, was found to have successively collected customer payments totaling 1,584 yuan between March and July of this year and misappropriated them for his personal use. Zhuang Zuxin, the manager of the store, discovered this and reported it to the Qiukou Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Zhou and transfer him to the First Special District Local Court for investigation and detention. The other day, Judge Liu Yugui held another hearing. The defendant admitted to misappropriating the funds, but claimed that most of it was spent on business entertainment and in brothels. He requested to be released to settle the matter and hired a lawyer to defend him. Judge Liu sentenced the defendant to six months imprisonment, suspended for three years, and ordered him to compensate the plaintiff for the amount claimed, and to pay a shop surety of 1,000 yuan to be released to settle the matter.</p>
<h3>Red Pill Manufacturing Ring Busted in Xujiahui, Sentences Handed Down</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui area in western Shanghai is relatively far from the city, so organizations dealing with narcotics secretly set up shop there. A large-scale morphine manufacturing ring was previously busted, and the German engineer, Baituo, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Recently, locals Xu A'hu, Xu A'di, Xu Mao'di, Yu Shaoyuan, Zhou A'fu, and a woman named Xu Wangshi, along with hooligans Yang Yueqing, Xu A'long, and Tang A'du, pooled their resources and provided venues to open a large red pill manufacturing ring. Their daily operations were quite large. The Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of this and dispatched inspectors, along with police officers from the Second Precinct of the Sixth District, to raid the place. They arrested Xu A'hu, Xu Mao'di, Xu A'di, Yu Shaoyuan, Zhou A'fu, and Xu Wangshi, confiscating half a sack of red pills, weighing 16 catties, one can of white powder, one package of Sitian mud, two cans of sugar frost, one bag of flour, one Meng basin, one balance scale, four pill boards, one copper plate for making pills, four wooden boards, one ceramic bowl for red pill powder, two baskets of medicinal powder, four lead boxes, two iron boxes, and nineteen leather boxes. All of these items were immediately transferred to the Local Court. The prosecutor, citing the Opium Suppression Law on manufacturing opium substitutes, filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Zhang held a trial and sentenced Xu A'hu to one year and four months imprisonment and a fine of 700 yuan. Xu A'di, Xu Mao'di, and Yu Shaoyuan were each sentenced to one year and two months imprisonment and a fine of 600 yuan. Zhou A'fu was an employee, and Xu Wangshi provided the venue, so they were each sentenced to eight months imprisonment and a fine of 100 yuan. The confiscated items were ordered to be confiscated and destroyed. Yang Yueqing, Tang A'du, and Xu A'long, who were at large, will be dealt with after their arrest.</p>
<h3>Pitiful Pear Vendor</h3>
<p>First Driven Away by Police, Then Injured by a Car</p>
<p>Wang Jinwen, a 43-year-old native of Huaicheng, Jiangbei, resides above the Yu Clothing Shop opposite the Tangjiawan Small Vegetable Market in the French Concession and operates a fruit stall nearby. At 11:00 PM the other night, he had not yet closed his stall and was driven away by the police. Wang hurriedly packed up his stall, and the pears scattered on the ground. As he bent over to pick up the pears, he was unexpectedly struck from behind by a car that did not honk its horn. Wang was unable to avoid it and was run over, suffering head injuries with blood gushing out. He lost consciousness. The police arrived and sent Wang to Guangci Hospital, while taking the driver back to the police station for investigation. It is reported that Wang's injuries are quite serious, and his life may be in danger. He has a wife and seven children, and his family's livelihood will be affected.</p>
<h3>Boatmen's Bloody Battle</h3>
<p>Injured on Both Sides</p>
<p>Boatmen Zhou Zide and Wang Laoqi are sailors on the Wanxiang Launch. The other day, when they sailed to Minhang, they were instructed by the local Anti-Japanese Association to stop the boat for inspection. Due to the tide, they collided with a coal boat driven by Zhang Zuoyi and Zhang Yongxiang from Jiangbei, resulting in a quarrel. Boatmen are mostly impetuous, so a disagreement led to a water battle, using poles and sticks against each other. In the ensuing bloody fight, Zhang Yongxiang's wrist was injured and broken, while Zhou Zide was also beaten and injured. The First District of the Water Police Corps detained Zhou Zide and Wang Laoqi, while Zhang Zuoyi accompanied Zhang Yongxiang to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the district transferred Zhou Zide and Wang Laoqi to the Local Court, ordering Zhang Yongxiang and Zhang Zuoyi to surrender themselves. After the prosecutor examined both sides, he ordered Zhou Zide, Wang Laoqi, and Zhang Zuoyi to be detained, and Zhang Yongxiang to be sent to the hospital for treatment, also instructing them to be prosecuted together.</p>
<h3>Shangyu Native Association Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shangyu Native Association held an executive and supervisory committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Wei Changhe, Wu Liang, Wei Duansheng, Wang Zhixiang, and Chen Xichang. Wang Zhixiang was publicly elected as chairman. After performing the rituals, the chairman reported on the disbursement of travel expenses to 68 people, including Xie Shiying and Wang Zishan, and the distribution of five large boxes of medicine. He also reported on dozens of public welfare matters, such as searching for wives and daughters and mediating disputes. The meeting then discussed the proposals: (1) A proposal to urgently establish a free school was resolved to first organize a board of directors to discuss its establishment. (2) The association's constitution needs to be amended, so it was handed over to the documentation section to draft and submit to the general meeting for resolution. Passed. (3) The date of this year's annual general meeting was set for October 8th. Passed. (4) The association is currently extremely busy with requests for assistance from fellow villagers and other matters, and should appropriately add staff. It was resolved to reserve this for the general meeting to decide. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Changes of Judges</h3>
<p>Zhou Yunhui, the presiding judge of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in the French Concession (civil and criminal combined), was originally transferred from his position as the president of the Jiangning Local Court. He has now been ordered by the Ministry of Justice to be transferred to Nanjing Supreme Court as a judge. To fill the vacant presiding judge position, the Ministry ordered Guo Dezhang, the director of the criminal court of the same court, to be promoted. To fill Guo's vacancy, the Ministry ordered Sun Yunfu, a judge of the Hebei Court in Tianjin, to come to Shanghai to fill the position.</p>

<h3>Submission Preliminary Plan for Fundamentally Addressing the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Liu Huanwei For thousands of years, the Yellow River has been a scourge to China, as everyone knows. Dynasties and common people alike have spared no effort to defend against and eliminate this great disaster. Records in history books are sufficient for verification, and the number of plans is truly as numerous as hairs on an ox. However, upon reviewing their designs, the points of attention are all like treating a headache only when the head hurts, and treating a foot only when the foot hurts. There has never been a deep investigation into the primary cause of the Yellow River's scourge, nor any hope for a fundamental cure. As a result, the Yellow River has repeatedly changed its course, surging and raging uncontrollably. Scholars in the country can only frown and lament together, without any plans to devise. The reason for this is that Chinese people are rich in traditional concepts, believing that the scourge of the Yellow River lies entirely east of Kaifeng and Yangwu. Therefore, surveying, research, design, and construction are all concentrated in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, like treating a boil by simply applying external medicine, without considering clearing the blood and promoting drainage, leading to the constant recurrence and making it impossible to hope for a complete cure. The historical methods of managing the Yellow River have been like this. It is essential to know that the primary cause of the Yellow River's scourge lies not in the lower reaches but in the upper reaches. The Yellow River originates in Qinghai. Because of the sloping terrain, the water volume suddenly increases whenever there is heavy rain or snow melts, rushing down to the plains, gushing for thousands of miles, like treating a disease in the heart and abdomen that cannot be effectively treated with external medicine. An examination shows that within Qinghai Province, from east of Eling Lake to the border of Gansu Province, the Yellow River has 46 tributaries. After entering Gansu Province, it has 67 tributaries within Gansu Province. Among them, the Qingshui River, Daxia River, Tao River, Datong River, and Zuli River are relatively large. Each of these rivers has dozens of tributaries. Most of these tributaries are located between steep cliffs. During the rainy season in summer, the water volume simultaneously converges into the Yellow River, forming a torrential and surging force that reaches the downstream plains, overflowing and escaping, causing numerous dangerous situations that cannot be contained. The method to fundamentally cure the Yellow River is to start from the upper reaches, and the only way to deal with the upper reaches is to store water and conserve flow. The south of the Hetao region in Suiyuan and the Ordos region are most suitable. The area is entirely a desolate desert, with sand dunes everywhere. According to Major Pereira's Travels in Ordos, the central part of the area is deeply depressed. The elevation along both sides of the Yellow River is 4,600 to 5,100 feet, while the Dabaisheng Lake, only about eight miles from the Yellow River, is elevated to 830 feet. If a canal can be built to connect the Yellow River with Dabaisheng Lake, the entire Ordos region can be irrigated, and the Yellow River's water volume can be regulated by this vast lake area. Then, with a little effort to guide the lower reaches, there will be no problem, and China can permanently escape the Yellow River's scourge. After the barren land of Ordos is transformed into a vast lake, the climate of northern Shaanxi can also be improved, and the irrigation problem of the Wuyuan Hetao region can also be solved. This is an additional benefit. It seems that there is no better plan for fundamentally curing the Yellow River while simultaneously creating benefits for the Northwest. For more detailed principles, please refer to the following two books: (1) Please refer to the author's "Preliminary Views on Water Conservancy," which contains detailed theories on water management (the Chinese Science Society (Science Magazine) previously reprinted it). (2) Please refer to the translated version of Pereira's "Travels in Ordos" in the Oriental Library No. 16 published by the Commercial Press. (Steps for the Proposed Plan to Fundamentally Cure the Yellow River) (1) Complete the Baoning Railway. (2) Survey the terrain and elevation of the south bank of the Yellow River, from where the Yellow River exits the Great Wall to where it re-enters the Great Wall, within 100 kilometers of the south bank. This work should be entrusted to the Army Survey Bureau, using the simplest and quickest method to obtain a contour map. (3) Dig several drainage canals to divert water into the central part of Ordos, resulting in the inundation of Ordos and the formation of a complex system of lakes and rivers. (4) Post-disaster measures: Prepare various water transportation tools (such as gasoline boats and small steamships), guide all the lama residents to change their lifestyle to living on boats. This article is just the author's humble opinion, which may be used as a reference for the people of the country. If the wise men of the country are willing to provide guidance, I will be very grateful.

<h3>Sleep</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>In terms of length, (sleep) and China have a very long history. Before the ancient sage kings and enlightened rulers were born, their mothers always had a strange dream of something entering their womb. This proves that the rise and fall of the country is closely related to that sleep of the mother. Even in the folk, (sleep) also occupies a very important position. Zhuge Liang's afternoon nap in his thatched cottage, set to the tune of ice strings by storytellers, humming and strumming while they sang, was so wonderful it always made the audience yawn repeatedly. (A ten-year dream of Yangzhou), even now, is still an exquisite phrase, exquisite precisely because of the sleep in it. Even more popular and beloved is the sleep history of (Chen Tuan sleeping for a thousand years). Peng Zu lived to be eight hundred years old, but Chen Tuan, after waking up from his nap, still said Peng Zu was short-lived.</p>
<p>In terms of breadth, (sleep) also has a special relationship with the Chinese people. On trains, besides those who talk and smoke, the third type of person seen is those who sway back and forth and doze off to the vibration of the train. Even on a very short journey, there are those who knock their heads on the shoulders of their neighbors, or have their belongings stolen without even knowing it. If the reader is interested, they can go to the road early in the morning and see several people sitting in rickshaws with their heads and shoulders lying across the rickshaw body asleep. University students and middle school students dozing off in the classroom, office workers putting their feet on their desks and taking midday naps, are daily routines. As for the snoring that echoes off the beams in teahouses and bathhouses, it is not surprising to see it as a spectacle. Even in barbershops, there are those who doze off so much that the barber cannot shave them, which is also not unprecedented. Losing territory and humiliating the country, not forgetting to sleep to not forget the shame, so it is necessary to (sleep on brushwood). When the strong enemy attacks, everyone says they will destroy the enemy before eating, but later comes the phrase (waiting for orders with spears as pillows). It can be seen that even at this (life-or-death) moment, they cannot forget sleep. So (sleep) is so deeply related to China that it can be called (globally unique) and (world-beating). (Sleeping pig) cannot be said to be without origin. Recently, I heard that (sleeping sickness is rampant in the United States, and the health authorities are greatly alarmed. I wonder if the patients infected with this sleeping sickness) are similar to our Chinese people's love of sleep. If my guess is correct, then (the friendship between China and the United States has always been close), so it would be good to become sworn brothers.</p>
<h3>Smart People and Musicians</h3>
<p>— Hu Wen</p>
<p>Smart people aren't born that way. As the saying goes, ("Generals and ministers are not born into their positions"), some learn from teachers, some are infected by friends, and some gain it from their own life experiences. To learn to be a smart person, it's not too difficult, but it's also not that easy. Although you don't necessarily have to seek out teachers and friends, you must at least know three secrets.</p>
<p>What are the three secrets? They are (blowing), (pulling), and (plucking). First, you naturally have to know how to (blow). There are no limits to the scope of (blowing). You should blow according to what kind of person the other party is. For example, if an old friend from the countryside comes to you, you can say to him: ("XX important person is my friend, XX tycoon is my sworn brother!") If that friend is a local rich man, he will definitely flatter you with some greeting money or give you some gifts as a token of respect. Isn't this the benefit of (blowing)? (Blowing) is used among peers or younger friends. If it's someone above you or someone you often need to ask for help, then you can only implement the policy of (pulling). The effect of (pulling) is even greater than (blowing)! Suppose the boss takes a fancy to a Xishi in a small foreign goods store or a sister in a friend's house and wants to take her as a concubine, you must quickly (pull). Once (pulling) is successful, the blessing is truly infinite.</p>
<p>If you don't have the ability to (pull), or (pulling) such a good deed doesn't fall on you, then you must have the conditions to (pluck). What is (plucking)? It means that your face must be as thick as a spring, able to be soft and hard at will. You must immediately soften to superiors and flatter them, but to bumpkins from the countryside, you must put on a thick face. If you can do this, you can also be considered a smart person.</p>
<p>There are many tricks to learning to be smart. These three are just the general outline. There are also various other secrets.</p>
<p>Let those who want to be smart people study them carefully. I won't say much more here.</p>
<p>From smart people, I think of Chinese musicians. Musicians are good at (blowing) (洞簫笛笙 - Dongxiao, Dizi, Sheng), (pulling) (京胡二胡 - Jinghu, Erhu), and (plucking) (三絃琵琶 - Sanxian, Pipa). Although the techniques used are different, the (bartering for bread principle) is the same. I think there are no people in the world more alike than them.</p>
<h3>In Front of Her Husband</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>In front of your husband, you must never say how comfortable and happy someone else's life is, because this will prick your husband's heart. In front of your husband, you must never say how healthy and handsome some man is, because this can cause your husband to have improper suspicions.</p>
<p>In front of your husband, you must not often ask to buy this or that. If your husband is in financial straits, this can cause your husband to feel great mental discomfort.</p>
<p>In front of your husband, you should often play with your innocent and clean little angels, because this can increase the husband's happiness and indirectly increase the love between husband and wife.</p>
<p>In front of your husband, do not constantly report the dire state of the family finances, because this will cause your husband great sadness.</p>
<p>In front of your husband...</p>
<h3>On Muteness</h3>
<p>— Lu Dun</p>
<p>Many people categorize the mute among the disabled, along with the lame and the blind. I feel this is unfair. The mouth of a mute is no different in structure from that of an ordinary person. It's just that they lack the skill of speaking. But the skill of the mouth is definitely not just speaking. It also has the functions of eating and kissing. A mute can eat Western food and Chinese food, and can also drink soup and wine. They can also distinguish between salty, sweet, and sour. As for kissing, the mute's mouth is originally intact. Since it doesn't interfere with eating and drinking, there's even less inconvenience to kissing? Moreover, according to physiologists, kissing involves three senses: smell, taste, and touch. The mute can still kiss their lover as before.</p>
<p>Speaking of (speaking), there are two common sayings that advise people to speak less: ("Illness enters through the mouth, and trouble comes out of it"). Moreover, speaking in this day and age is not easy. Since elders teach us the secret to getting by in the world (it's better to do less than to do more), then we should speak less, and it's best to pretend to be mute. The ancient books say: ("The wise protect themselves"). This is even clearer evidence that you should speak less. People with mouths that can speak still have to pretend to be deaf and mute, so you might as well just be mute. ("Food and sex are the greatest desires of man"). This is an ancient saying. Since a mute can eat and drink, they are not deficient in the way of being human. Why must they speak? Moreover, ("A gorilla can speak, but it doesn't leave the animal kingdom. A parrot can speak, but it doesn't leave the bird kingdom."). It's pitiful that animals work so hard to learn a few words, only to be ridiculed. Since they are already mute, why must they learn to use gestures to try to speak? Is it because Li Menggeng, a member of the Control Yuan, proposed that the central government organize a (Council of Speakers) and is preparing to speak out a lot? Let mute friends guess this riddle?</p>
<h3>The Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Guests Depart with Shy Tenderness and Waving Smiles, Visitors Arrive with Old Grudges and Troubled Hearts</p>
<p>He didn't dare to say any more. Just then, another person entered the door, and he went to arrange the business. Ji Zhi sat drinking, his eyes fixed on the wheat field. He remembered that when he left Haidian, the distant mountains and nearby fields were covered with snow. Now that he was back, it was a completely different sight, filled with green. People are the same way. When he left, the old Yang girl was still a girl. Now that he was back, she might already be Mrs. Zhao, the company commander. Company Commander Zhao introduced me to teach at Dahongmen. I thought he was acting righteously, helping me out. Now that I think about it, he was using a trick to lure the tiger away from the mountain. I'm really too honest. Why didn't I think it through myself? A person I didn't know suddenly came to visit and suddenly offered me a job. What was he after? If it wasn't for something, people in the military aren't very free, and their time is very limited. Why would he run from outside the city to inside the city to visit me? Looking back on it, there's no doubt that I fell for someone's trick. Since I fell for someone's trick, why thank them? Wouldn't that just make them laugh at me? He stared at the fields, his mind wandering. He held his cup and kept drinking one cup after another. After finishing four ounces of wine, he continued to ask the waiter for another four ounces. He finished both dishes and looked at the thick shade of the willow tree outside the door. It had already shrunk into a ball, which clearly meant that the sun was at its peak and it was almost noon. If he lingered any longer, he might be late getting home. So he supported himself on the table, swayed a few times, and stood up. Unexpectedly, as he stood up, he had an unexpected encounter that forced him to lower his head again (196).</p>
<h3>A Sick Beauty</h3>
<p>— Yu Renmei</p>
<p>(The maid helps her up, delicate and weak, only then is she newly blessed by grace.) Our plump Concubine Yang cannot be considered a sick beauty, but in the eyes of ancient writers, she must be described as weak and unable to support herself to be considered a beauty beloved by the emperor. Lin Daiyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" is a complete sick beauty, searching for sorrow and hatred for no reason, washing her face with tears every day. When she recites the Burial Flower Song of falling petals and flying flowers, I don't know how many heartbreaking tears she sheds. Such a melancholic and sickly maiden with the symbolism of pulmonary tuberculosis is annoying to see, but she is invariably an ancient Eastern standard beauty in the writings of writers.</p>
<p>A perfectly good pair of natural feet is forcibly bound to be no bigger than a handful; a natural chest insists on wrapping a tight corset, straight so hard than a package. A gust of wind is about to sway and stand unstable, have to call a servant girl, supporting out of the boudoir, only then does it appear to be a world-class beauty who topples countries and cities.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that such a morbid woman cannot give birth to a robust and tall man, so the prime ministers and ministers who have held the power of the country throughout the dynasties are all white-faced scholars without the power to fight chickens. What kind of career can they be expected to make?</p>
<p>Until now, our winning a ("Sick Man of East Asia") title is definitely not obtained by luck. This may be the success of my country's thousands of years of studying the philosophy of morbidity.</p>
<p>Little Knowledge</p>
<h3>The Medicinal Effects of Seasonal Fruits</h3>
<p>Fruits such as peaches, pears, oranges, and melons are seasonal foods in the summer, and are the most loved by everyone. These fruits are very beneficial to our bodies. Now I will write down the important ones.</p>
<h3>Pear</h3>
<p>Pears not only aid in the digestive function of the stomach, but also have the effect of neutralizing food poisoning. Because pears contain a large amount of water, they can reduce fever. If you have a mild fever with lung disease, eating fresh pears regularly can reduce the disease. If children have whooping cough or a cold with a cough, take one raw pear, add two slices of radish, a little brown sugar or rock sugar, boil it, and feed them the juice, which is very effective. Also, for people with strokes who can't close their mouths, irrigating them with pear juice is especially effective.</p>
<h3>Grapes</h3>
<p>Grapes are the main nutrient for heart disease, and also a conditioning medicine for kidney disease, liver disease, urinary tract disease, obesity, and constipation. If there are no fresh grapes, it is good to eat more raisins, but people suffering from beriberi, excessive stomach acid, gastric ulcers, typhlitis, or acute peritonitis should absolutely not eat them.</p>
<h3>Orange</h3>
<p>Oranges are the only good product for treating beriberi. They are effective regardless of the severity of the condition or how long it has been. It is especially appropriate to eat one after a meal three times a day. If the orange tastes too sour, you can add some white sugar, slice it with a knife and soak it in tea, and it can also prevent intestinal bleeding.</p>
<h3>Peach</h3>
<p>Boiling peach leaves in water for bathing is better than any medicinal water or soap. Squeezing the juice of the leaves and using it to wipe the skin can remove skin blemishes. Also, peach kernels have the function of opening the bowels. People who often have constipation should eat more peach kernels, which is very suitable, and it can also relieve McLean poisoning. It is also effective for women with irregular menstruation. Also, wiping the face with peach leaf juice can gradually make the skin delicate.</p>
<h3>Melon</h3>
<p>Melons are rich in vitamin A, which contains elements that strengthen the body. Foreigners have a saying, ("A summer melon is comparable to a winter orange"). In general, people who lack vitamin A and suffer from anemia are very suitable to choose various melons in the summer, and the aroma of melons can make the appetite increase.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Eating Bananas</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>Bananas are plants from temperate regions and reproduce very quickly. Usually they grow very large in ten to twelve or thirteen months. However, they are annual plants, so after the bananas are picked, the tree will wither and die. After the old tree falls, new buds can sprout on the side of the trunk. These new buds gradually grow into seedlings for planting. Therefore, in tropical areas with four seasons of summer, they can be cultivated in rotation without interruption. Moreover, due to the strong sun in tropical areas, there are large trees that reach four or five meters in height. Speaking of the fruit we eat, from a scientific point of view, it is not actually the fruit. The sweet part is the inner peel of the banana, and the green peel that is peeled off and discarded is the outer peel of the banana. Therefore, it is wrong for ordinary people to think that what they are eating is the flesh. Bananas are picked from the place of origin and sent to the inland areas. They are all green and unripe. If you want them to ripen early in the winter, you can bake them with fire. In the summer, you can put them in an ice room and let the water from the melting ice drip on the bananas, maintaining a temperature of 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, after four or five days in the summer and seven or eight days in the winter, they will gradually turn yellow and ripen. Bananas contain a lot of nutrients, especially because they contain vitamin C, so they can prevent anemia. During the European War, there was a German officer named Locke who and soldiers were shipwrecked on a sailboat due to a storm and drifted into the sea. The ship was blown to the South Pacific. Because they hadn't eaten green vegetables for a long time, they all suffered from anemia, their tongues were scorched, their lips were red, and their teeth fell out, and they were on the verge of death. Later, they drifted to a small island and saw bananas. They all scrambled to eat them to fill their stomachs. After less than three days, everyone's vitality was completely restored.</p>

<h3>Shanghai City Games</h3>
<p>Five National Records Broken</p>
<p>Fu Baolu Breaks National Record in Pole Vault in Decathlon</p>
<p>Chen Ling Wins Decathlon Championship with Score Approaching National Record</p>
<p>Hujiang Wins Basketball Championship, Liangjiang Wins Women's Basketball</p>
<p>Jinan Wins Football Championship, Wuben Wins Women's Volleyball</p>
<p>Among those participating in the pentathlon, there were originally six people, including Sun Hupei, Hao Chunde, Wang Jihuai, Chen Baoqiu, Pan Chengbin, and Yang Fang. Only Sun Hupei did not participate yesterday. Hao, Wang, Chen, and others competed for this championship. Wang once held the national record of 2697.605 points. Hao won the championship at the previous National Games in Hangzhou. Chen Baoqiu's pentathlon score at the Jiangnan University Games also reached a peak of more than 2,800. Therefore, yesterday's competition was no different from a three-way battle between Hao, Wang, and Chen. At the beginning of the competition, the first event was the long jump. Hao Chunde had previously won the long jump championship at this year's competition with 6.62 meters, so in yesterday's competition, he still had the remaining power of his victory. He achieved a record of 6.595 meters in the second jump. The third jump was 6.85 meters, exceeding the official national long jump record, but unfortunately it was not counted due to a foul. Wang Jihuai, because he had not been able to fully display his talents in the previous days, worked hard in yesterday's pentathlon to try to wipe out his shame. In the first event, the long jump, he jumped 6.63 meters and scored 762 points. Chen Baoqiu and Pan Chengbin also both exceeded 6 meters. The second event, the javelin throw, Hao was not as proud as he had been in the previous days. Yang Fang led the way with 43.36 meters. Wang Jihuai followed closely with 42.32 meters, and Hao Chunde with 42.82 meters. Following the javelin throw was the 200-meter race. Wang and Chen ran together in the first group. Wang achieved a score of 24.8 seconds, and Chen was more than ten meters behind with a score of 26 seconds. Hao Chunde ran alone in the last group and achieved a record of 24 seconds, which was not easy. The fourth event, the discus throw, was originally the specialty of the Iron Bull. The other athletes did not exceed 30 meters, and Chen's score was only 31.67 meters. The athletes scored the fewest points and the worst results in this event. The last event, the 1500-meter race, was the key to victory or defeat. All the athletes tried their best to compete. In the first group, Wang Jihuai and Iron Bull ran together, with Wang leading the way. Chen followed closely behind. At the finish line, Wang abandoned Chen by about 200 meters. Checking Wang's score, it was 5 minutes and 3.4 seconds. Among the pentathlon events, it is rare to get this record in the 1500-meter race. The total score was 2914.14, breaking his own record of 2821.305 points, and also breaking the national new record of 2893.24 points set by Chen Baoqiu at this year's Jiangnan University Games. It also broke Wu Demao's overseas record of 2907.735 points. Wang's creation of a new record was really due to his struggle in the last 1500-meter race. Hao Chunde finished second with a difference of more than 80 points, and his score also broke Wang's original national record. Chen Baoqiu finished third with a difference of 300 points, and Yang Fang finished fourth with a difference of 600 points. Here is a comparison of the scores of Wang and Wu Demao:</p>

<h3>Complete Scores of the Pentathlon</h3>

<h3>Fu Baolu Breaks National Record in Pole Vault</h3>
<p>Score of 3.785 Meters Achieved in the Decathlon, Chen Ling First in the Decathlon with 5229.755 Points</p>
<p>The first half of the decathlon was completed on Friday. Yesterday there was still the second half left. In the previous days' trend, Chen Ling was in the lead, followed by Xiao Dinghua, Wu Zhongyao, Fu Baolu, Cao Yu, Liu Xiwu and others. The result of yesterday's competition was a major reversal of the situation compared to the previous days. Fu Baolu rose from fourth to second, Liu Xiwu rose from sixth to third, Cao Yu rose from fifth to fourth, while Xiao and Wu fell to fifth and sixth. In the second half of the decathlon, Chen Ling's score in the high hurdles was the best. Unfortunately, Chen was not very successful in the discus and javelin throw, so he failed to exceed the national record. The most exciting thing in yesterday's decathlon was Fu Baolu's pole vault. In this competition, Cao Yu and Liu Xiwu successively jumped over 3.27 meters, and Chen Ling then jumped over 3.395 meters. After that, Fu Baolu jumped alone, first jumping over 3.66 meters, and then rising to 3.785 meters, which he also jumped over with ease. Checking this height, it has exceeded his own national record. It is rare to have such a result in the decathlon pole vault. This one event alone earned more than 900 points, which is close to the world record of 1,000 points for the decathlon pole vault. It is said that Mr. Fu's achievement is due to his constant practice throughout the year. Since Mr. Fu came to Shanghai, he has been working at the Shanghai Qinfen Bookstore, serving as a clerk in the Sports Editorial Department of the bureau. Because the bureau is negotiating with the National Sports Promotion Association's sports field, Fu practiced hard after work to determine the movement. Fu is also quite good at throwing. In the discus throw event, he easily achieved a record of 31.50 meters with a light try. However, in the 1500-meter event, Mr. Fu, because he was used to jumping, did not want to force himself, so as to prevent damage to his muscles, so he finished the event normally. The total score was in second place. Liu Xiwu, who was third, was not very successful in the first five events, but his scores in the last five events were very average. Cao Yu, who was fourth, is a veteran of the Shanghai decathlon and was the champion of the previous National Games in Shanghai. Because he had neglected practice, he finished fourth. Xiao Dinghua and Wu Zhongyao were defeated in the pole vault, which led to their failure to be selected.</p>

<h3>Jinan Wins Football Championship, Donghua Forfeits</h3>
<p>The team that won the right to compete in football was Donghua vs. Jinan. The final was originally scheduled for yesterday, but it was not held because Donghua requested a postponement. According to Donghua's reason for requesting a postponement, the registration for the conference was limited to 15 people, but six people were injured and unable to play, so they could not form a team, so they requested a change of date for the game. However, the conference believed that the request for a change of date was in accordance with the articles of association and could not be allowed. Donghua had no choice but to voluntarily forfeit. The football championship should belong to Jinan. Thus, a wonderful football battle was invisibly eliminated, which is inevitably disappointing.</p>
<h3>Wuben Wins Women's Volleyball Championship</h3>
<p>Hai Xing Guo Xiaoping Does Not Violate Amateur Rules</p>
<p>The women's volleyball final (Wuben vs. Haixing) was held amidst protests. Details have been recorded in previous reports. Previously, the Minli Girls' Middle School volleyball team raised a protest against the qualifications of Haixing team member Guo Xiaoping. After an investigation by the conference and a resolution by the conference's arbitration committee, Guo Xiaoping is currently a first-grade teacher at Guangzhao Elementary School, teaching subjects such as Mandarin and arithmetic (not teaching physical education), and has been doing so for more than a year. There is no conflict with the qualifications of amateur athletes, only the lack of procedures for restoring amateur qualifications. Therefore, the women's volleyball championship should belong to Wuben.</p>

<h3>Hujiang Wins Men's Basketball Championship, Liangjiang Wins Women's Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>Hujiang Defeats Jinan 47 to 34, Coming from Behind</p>
<p>Liangjiang Defeats Southeast 25 to 21, Victory Not Easy</p>
<p>The men's and women's basketball games at the City Games last night were a big surprise, almost breaking records and creating new situations. Although Hujiang defeated Jinan 47 to 34 to win the men's championship, Hujiang was always under Jinan's lead in the first half. Liangjiang defeated Southeast 25 to 21 to win the women's championship. The closeness of the situation and the intensity of the competition were unprecedented. The victory was decided in the last quarter. Southeast is rising, and there is endless hope. The battle conditions of the two groups are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Tense and Thrilling, Liangjiang Defeats Southeast</h3>
<p>The battle between Liangjiang and Southeast was tense and thrilling almost every minute and every second. From the beginning to the end, the two sides were only two or three points apart. The scores were tied four or five times. Moreover, in the second quarter, Southeast exceeded with 16 to 14. The previous one-sided prediction that Liangjiang would win completely failed. If Southeast had not been flustered in the last quarter, the situation might have changed greatly. The lack of experience cannot be blamed. As a rising new army, such achievements are worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>Southeast Advancement</h3>
<p>The ball skills of Jiangsu and Anhui were still ordinary, with no special advancements to speak of. The defense had noticeably declined. The most noteworthy aspect was the rapid advancement of Southeast's ball skills. The forwards' activity and the proficiency of their connections were greatly praised throughout the game. Once the ball entered the Jiangsu and Anhui area, there was an immediate danger of scoring. Pan Yueying's performance on the court needs no introduction. Center Liao Zhuyuan was quick and lively, unprecedented. Being slightly taller, he was most suitable as a center. Sun Cheng was also competent, but both Liao and Sun were lacking in shooting. The defense was also weak, and passing the ball was particularly strenuous. In terms of actual strength, the two teams were almost evenly matched; Jiangsu and Anhui relied on their experience and toughness.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Distinguish</h3>
<p>Yang Sen scored first, but Liao Zhuyuan immediately returned the favor. Chen Rongming and Pan Yueying both showed their skills. Southeast took the lead twice, at 4-3 and 6-5. The competition between the two sides became increasingly fierce. Southeast missed two consecutive opportunities under the basket. Jiangsu and Anhui finally took the lead in the first quarter with two goals by Yang Sen and Chen Rongming, 9-6. In the second quarter, Southeast showed their colors. Pan Yueying scored a point by making a free throw due to a foul by Shi Ruixia, making it 12-12. Pan Yueying then added another goal, putting Southeast ahead. Chen Rongming tied the score at 16-16 by halftime.</p>
<h3>Final Victory</h3>
<p>In the second half, Yang Sen took the lead again by making a free throw, but Sun Cheng also made a free throw, making it 17-17. At this time, Jiangsu and Anhui's defender Shi Ruixia was sent off for committing three personal fouls, causing great turmoil. Unfortunately, due to Southeast's carelessness, Jiangsu and Anhui took a two-point lead in the third quarter, 21-19. In the final deciding quarter, both sides were in a state of panic and confusion. The team that remained calm prevailed. Chen Rongming made a free throw, adding one point. Liao Zhuyuan scored a long shot, putting Southeast only one point behind. Another shot would have won them the game. At this time, the ball lingered in Jiangsu and Anhui's territory for a long time. Unfortunately, Southeast was flustered and indecisive, and Jiangsu and Anhui finally won with a score of 25-21. The referees were Shu Hong and Lu Xiangqian.</p>

<h3>Shanghai University Defeats Jinan University: Jinan University's Momentum</h3>
<p>Judging from the first half of the Shanghai University vs. Jinan University game, there was a possibility of an amazing result. Jinan University took the lead with 7-0, demonstrating great power. They continued to lead all the way until two minutes before the end of the first half, when Shanghai University fought back to tie the score at 19-19. Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingyong each made outstanding contributions, turning defeat into victory at 21-19. The first half ended like this. Jinan University's performance in the first half was also particularly smooth and well-coordinated. The speed of their progress was unexpected. Later, they led 13-7, six points ahead. Seeing that the situation was not good, Lu Zhongen replaced Sun Baoqing, and Shanghai University gradually approached, and the situation changed.

<h3>Shanghai University Rising</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Jinan University's Yin Guiren scored twice, tying the score again at 25-25. Just when it seemed that Jinan University would rise again, they suddenly suffered a setback. Shanghai University scored 15 consecutive points, making it 40-25. The situation of the game became stable. Jinan University's defender Wang Nanzhen suffered an abdominal injury, which had an impact. He was later replaced by Ye Peichu, whose strength was much lower. At 43-28, an unfortunate misunderstanding occurred. The referee ordered both of the main players, Huang Zhaolin and Feng Nianhua, to leave the court. After this, the situation calmed down, and Shanghai University also adopted a conservative policy, ending the game at 47-34. The referees were Shu Hong and Li Zuqi.</p>

<h3>Foreign Cat</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Whenever people study French and get to the stage of reading selected texts, they will always read a piece called: Daudet’s (Monsieur Seguin’s Goat) (Le Chevre de monsieur Seguin). It tells the story of how Monsieur Seguin raised many goats, one after another, but they all ran away. The reason was that they could not bear the confinement of ropes and fences and longed for life behind the mountains. There, although there were wolves, they could jump, run, and roll around as they pleased; and when the wolves came, they could use their horns to fight them. Here, although the garden was clean, the grass was fresh, and the owner took great care of them, the ropes and fences were simply too unbearable, so at the first opportunity, they broke free of the ropes, slipped out of the fences, ran to the mountains behind, lived a new day, and then, when they encountered the wolves at night, they fought until their strength was exhausted, and then died, with no regrets. Thus, Monsieur Seguin never managed to keep a goat. Even if he lengthened the ropes, and warned them of the fate of previous goats, his goats always ran away, one by one.</p>
<p>The opposite of this story is Zola’s (Cat’s Paradise) (Le Paradis des Chats). It tells the story of a cat that a lady kept, which, because it was tired of the warm, comfortable, prison-like life, ran outside, mingled with other cats, and wanted to live a free life. But before a day was over, it became terrified. It saw that the so-called free life was rain, hunger, running around, escaping… It asked a female cat to send it back to its old home. It asked her to share the life it had, but she walked away disdainfully. The lady beat it for having run away, and then gave it meat to eat, so it concluded: “The place where you get beaten but have meat to eat is our cat’s paradise.”</p>
<p>Daudet and Zola are both great French writers; they both have other great works. The above are just short pieces, but even as short pieces, they are so lovely. I have read them separately before, and was moved by them. Now that I think of them together, I feel that they wrote such works, which seemed to agree with each other without any previous consultation, and must contain a social meaning that is not accidental.</p>
<h3>Sad Vendors</h3>
<p>— Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>The barber was trimming my hair as I was engrossed in reading a recently published book. I happened to look up and saw in the large mirror in front of me a reflection of the half-open front door. Outside, there was a haggard man, holding in his right hand a tumor that had grown on his neck and was almost as big as his own head. His face showed a look of pain, and he was saying words of pity in a low voice. The barber pushed my head to the left to shave the hair on my right cheek, and then I seemed to hear the clinking of coins. When I turned my face back, the man holding the tumor outside the door had disappeared. I thought that the sad vendor must have found a customer.</p>
<p>Yes, I call them sad vendors, and that's correct. Because they have nothing left, or they can't sell anything else, all that's left is sadness. They have no choice but to sell their sadness. Some hold up their tumors, some tremble with a foot full of festering sores, some use mournful words, some use tears, but selling sadness is all the same.</p>
<p>Sadness is their only asset, the goods they rely on to beg for the pity of others.</p>
<p>Society is full of all kinds of buying and selling all day long, but the selling of sadness is undoubtedly the cheapest. Some sell power, like you pay a certain amount of money and they can give you a position of considerable value or the power to exploit. Power is the force that controls matter, and matter is the element that creates or increases power; therefore, in order to increase this power, on the one hand, someone must buy the blood and sweat of others at a low price and sell it at a high price to consolidate their own power by making a profit. This kind of buying and selling has become the center of cutthroat competition for many people today. Even in our daily life of a thread and a towel, the breath of this kind of buying and selling exists.</p>
<p>In this way, since there are people who want to buy the blood and sweat of others, then naturally there will be people who want to sell their own blood and sweat. In the countryside and in the cities, there are people selling their blood and sweat everywhere. But unreasonable buying and selling will inevitably lead to a predicament. As a result, even those who want to sell their own blood and sweat at a low price are rejected. Blood and sweat cannot be sold, and some sell their wives and daughters, some sell their fields, and some even sell their only sickle.</p>
<p>Everything is gone. Blood and sweat still have nowhere to be sold. So now, every roadside and every city is full of people selling sadness. Their signs are big tumors, trembling festering feet. Some use mournful words, and some use tears. The only customers of sadness are charities. But true charities have no power, and those who have power are the opponents of charities. So the time when sadness has nowhere to sell is probably coming soon.</p>
<h3>Autumn Dream Diary</h3>
<p>— Ye Rong</p>
<p>After dinner, I took a book to bed to read, but unexpectedly fell asleep. Then I had a dream.</p>
<p>I dreamed that I had committed a crime by writing some kind of article, and after running away two or three times, I couldn't escape and was caught to be publicly executed. The punishment was very strange, like being cut in half at the waist, with everything above the waist cut off, but two hands were left; the body, head, and face were gone, but the hands and legs were still connected and could still walk and write.</p>
<p>Having lost my head and body, but still seeming to feel, I went everywhere with a stomach full of grievances to appeal for help. When I met people, they couldn't see me, as if I didn't exist, and I couldn't shout out, because I had already lost my mouth and tongue.</p>
<p>But my hands were still there, so I went to find paper and pen to write to them. As soon as I signed my name, they all said, "Oh," understood. I seemed much comforted.</p>
<p>So I traveled around, appealing for grievances everywhere with paper and pen, seeking comfort. In fact, I had even forgotten what grievances I had. But once, passing a doorway, I pushed the door open with both hands and saw light shining from behind, and my shadow was projected on the white wall opposite, but it was an extremely beautiful shadow with a complete head, face, body, and limbs. I was appreciating it when I felt someone chasing me from behind. My hands loosened, and I plunged into darkness, not knowing where I ended up. I woke up...</p>
<p>Dreams are like this, extremely meaningless, but this is the first dream since autumn, and it must be recorded. So I wrote it down on the right. After waking up, I was still surprised and confused, and told people about it, but everyone smiled lightly, as if it was not worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>— Wei Zengben</p>
<p>I woke up in the morning with a slight chill in my heart.</p>
<p>(Autumn, a voice is ringing in the clock. How charming, this music-like sound!)</p>
<p>I put on my clothes and, as usual, took a walk in the garden, which, although not very beautiful, was still moving...</p>
<p>(Autumn, a voice is floating in the leaves, floating outside the stream, floating in front of the necks of the red night-blooming cereus and purple morning glories.)</p>
<p>A pale blue sky.</p>
<p>A gray bird flies across the light blue sky. It sings... autumn, autumn...</p>
<p>(How charming, this music-like sound!)</p>
<p>A slight chill flowed through my heart again, the chill of autumn.</p>
<p>So, I returned to my room.</p>
<p>(Autumn, a voice is ringing in the clock.)</p>
<p>Autumn, a voice is ringing in my heart.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>I recently went to Hankou to send my wife home. I only spent one night in Hankou, but I spent seven days and seven nights on the boat. In my spare time, I pretended to be busy and wrote travel notes based on what I heard and saw. 1. Pilgrimage on the Boat No matter who it is, no matter how busy they are, once they get on the boat, they immediately seem like a spring that has been released from extreme tension, lazy and not at all energetic. This place seems like a resting villa, and also like a world of leisure.</p>
<p>Apart from the crew on the boat, if you take a week-long pilgrimage from the large dining room to the officer's cabin, to the cabin, to the steerage, what you see can be summed up in one word: an air of leisure and nonchalance. Of course, according to the difference in the class of the cabin, this air shows different postures, and these different postures are exactly the description of each different status. For example, the large dining room is a class in the highest position on this ship. The passengers in this class are naturally noble gentlemen, noble ladies, pot-bellied compradors, and young masters and young ladies. They are all wearing soft pajamas and lying on the sofa. If it is a pair, they are chatting warmly, like under the shade of a tree in a park. Gold apples, American tangerines, and chocolate candies are piled on the tea table next to them. Delicate hands and small knives are passing over the fruit skins, and the fruit skins are slowly, languidly hanging down. The men are holding cigars, and light smoke is floating in the air. Maybe there is a phonograph next to them, dragging out the sound of (The Scandalous History of the Palace). And in another room, there may be the sound of crackling cards, or the faint breath of opium. In short, in the large dining room, the air of leisure is luxurious, natural, and not at all pretentious. Down to the officer's cabin, it's a little worse here. The men's bellies are sticking out a little lower, the women's dimples are not so deep, and the couples are probably chewing on snacks or fruits while casually chatting. The lone passengers are mostly pulling up chairs and sitting by the boat railing to watch the river and the receding distant mountains. It is indeed a little worse than the large dining room, but no matter what, they still maintain the status of (rich people). Further down is the cabin, where small businessmen, low-level employees, and students are all here. In short, this is a class that cannot climb into the officer's cabin and is unwilling to descend into the steerage, which just describes the identity of a middle class. Some of the people here are lying in their bunks reading Jin Ping Mei, some are leaning against the boat railing humming (Sister, I Love You), some are chewing peanuts, some are stretching their legs and dozing, some are chatting idly about the world, and some may be pinching their fingers and frowning as they count the money in their pockets. Of course, here, they are still all leisurely, but their leisure is not as elegant and luxurious as that of the large dining room and the officer's cabin. Speaking of the steerage, that's terrible. Compared to the large dining room, it can be said that one is heaven and the other is hell. The people here are all thin and dark. Although they are idle, they all have an anxious look. Some people also hum (The Lonely King is Drunk in the Peach Blossom Palace), but the voice is a bit mournful. Some people are also eating pears and peanuts, but they are always so careful and cherish them so much. The people here are not really idle. They are just helplessly thrown into this prison of leisure temporarily. Each person's heart is busy and anxious! People are always smart enough. They will divide society into some different classes, and each person will go to the class they should be in according to their own identity. There is no sloppiness and no mistakes here. You only need to take a week-long pilgrimage on the boat, and you can verify this fact.</p>
<h3>Literacy Eradication Center (2)</h3>
<p>— By Konstantin Fedin, translated by Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>Maria Fortovna smiled bitterly:</p>
<p>"This book is a novel by Turgenev, a good Russian novel. I think it's worth your attention. Read it to me."</p>
<p>"Bazarov, this day, could not get up anymore," Tinga began to read: "He spent the night in a heavy, confused, drowsy sleep..."</p>
<p>Tinga kept interrupting, reading wrong, and couldn't read the last sentence anymore.</p>
<p>"That's terrible," Maria Fortovna said unhappily: "You didn't review at home, did you? It's clear as soon as you listen to it, no need to argue. Look at Kobeidkin, he reviewed at home. Did you hear him read? You should learn from him."</p>
<p>"He's reading the newspaper," Tinga retorted: "Isn't that our steel factory workers' newspaper?"</p>
<p>"What's the difference! I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Why are they the same? This is Turgenev, that's our factory newspaper. When I read the newspaper, I'm better than him."</p>
<p>"That's meaningless," Maria Fortovna said sharply: "Quite the opposite. The printed characters are much clearer here. Okay, you read the newspaper and see how well you read?"</p>
<p>Tinga took the newspaper from Kobeidkin and read fluently: "The issue of cadres is very urgent here. We are suffering from a shortage of manpower. The effectiveness of forced employment is very clear. But many comrades still do not understand this matter..."</p>
<p>He stopped reading and looked at Maria Fortovna triumphantly.</p>
<p>"That's a little strange," she said in surprise: "You really read it fluently."</p>
<p>"Because it's our own newspaper, not some Turgenev," Tinga replied: "First, I know everything here. I only need to see half a sentence, and I understand the second half without looking at it. Second, I am a worker correspondent myself, and these are all written by myself; how can I not read what I write myself?"</p>
<p>"I don't understand," Maria Fortovna said, still a little confused: "I thought you could hardly read, how could you write?"</p>
<p>"But the situation forces me to write. In our work, most of the work is done collectively. Some people write, some people edit, and some people collect materials. For example, the issue of cadres is also edited by ourselves. You want me to not even be able to read my own notes? How can a person not be able to read their own notes?"</p>
<p>"I didn't want you to not be able to read," Maria Fortovna said slowly.</p>
<p>"As for the issue of cadres," Tinga continued without listening: "The issue of cadres is really not easy to solve in our factory. Just look at the earthwork operations in the construction of the iron furnace."</p>
<p>"What does earthwork have to do with me?" Maria Fortovna said.</p>
<p>"It's not right to think like that. Many people think like that, what does it have to do with me. But how is labor distributed? I ask you, can you carry out labor distribution with this kind of thinking? Hey, you say, can you or can't you?"</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do?" Maria Fortovna asked.</p>
<p>"No, you can't," Ding Ru excitedly said: "In any case, the first iron furnace must be put into operation on May 15, but according to the current situation, how can we put it into operation? This is a problem..."</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Issue of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine (Continued)</h3>
<p>As for the principles of legislation and the administrative system, these are even less reason to restrict the development of the National Medicine Regulations. Don't you see that the proposer is a central committee member? Isn't the place of the proposal the Central Political Conference? Consider the legislative process, from where does it originate? The administrative system, how is it decided? If the Political Conference believes that the administrative system should be changed, then proposing amendments should be possible. What is the meaning of usurpation? Have you not heard Mr. Jiao say that (the mission of the National Medical Hall is to remedy the shortcomings of the administrative system)? Therefore, blaming the proposer for disrupting the administrative system is also meaningless.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current National Medicine Regulations, from the perspective of academic legislation, are insufficient to refute it. From the perspective of public sentiment, they can even assist it. Is it the case that the National Medicine Regulations are in no way in conflict with national affairs and can be allowed to be fully established? This is not the case. The destructive nature of the National Medicine Regulations is only aimed at the health administration itself. Let's not discuss how health administration is based on new medicine in every aspect. It is about eliminating filth, prohibiting opium, and preventing epidemics. All of these are based on new medicine, and epidemic prevention and health statistics belong exclusively to new medicine. Traditional medicine hinders it. If the country permanently recognizes traditional medicine as formal physicians, then the Contagious Disease Regulations will be nothing more than empty words, and all health statistics will never be complete. Therefore, I say that if the current National Medicine Regulations exist, health administration will perish. The two cannot coexist. It is only natural. It is not inappropriate to call the National Medicine Regulations disruptive to the administrative system. It is not slander to call them expelling health administration. I dare to ask the central committee members to reconsider this. The current National Medicine Regulations are destroying health administration in an indestructible way. If the country does not want health administration, then so be it. If not, then the National Medicine Regulations cannot be issued in this way. It can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>However, before the National Medicine Regulations were proposed, had health administration not already perished? The harm of opium is like a raging flood. All efforts are made to cater to it. Where are the policies to prohibit it? The plague and cholera threaten the northern and southern provinces every year. Sometimes, vaccines are used as a means. Where are the achievements of investigation and statistics? Provincial and county cities leave filth unattended on the streets, and even use hygiene as a name to collect money. They turn a deaf ear. Where are the steps to implement the law? Even in terms of the Physician Regulations themselves, there was no thorough resolution on the day the Ministry of Health was established, and there was also forbearance and complacency when the Physician Regulations were amended. Lacking the courage to convince people with eloquence, and lacking the integrity to stand up and fight for their position, they were perfunctory and indecisive, sitting and inviting the enemy. How can one expect people not to take advantage of their laxity? I believe that if the health authorities could shift the spirit used for piecemeal trivial matters to major policies and strategies, and focus the scheming mind used for sending off and welcoming guests to explaining the essence of health administration to the central committee members, would they not have eliminated the political turmoil in an invisible way? Now, instead of planning this, they are simply playing delaying tactics, temporarily suspending the words "Western medicine." They are neither able to give orders nor receive them, isolating themselves from others and inviting people's anger. The proposal of the National Medicine Regulations is self-inflicted by the health authorities.</p>
<p>Someone asks: Then, with health administration as the center, how should old-style Chinese medicine be handled? I say that it is greatly related to the political and financial situation. If the financial situation permits, and it is also possible for education administration, then set the steps, set the time limit, and gradually increase new medicine on one side and gradually decrease old medicine on the other. The policy of the so-called National Medicine Regulations will naturally be different. If the political and financial situation does not permit it, and there is no hope of temporarily adding medical schools and new medicine, then the management agencies, A and B, should not be divided from each other. If the Ministry of Internal Affairs is acceptable, why should the National Medical Hall be unacceptable? Those who argue for it do so for a reason, and those who defend it are flattering their own interests. I do not want to discuss trivial matters.</p>
<p>Alas! Politics cannot be procrastinated, and policies cannot be ambiguous. I dare to speak earnestly to the central committee members. The central government should view the overall situation of our country and believe that health administration can be actively carried out. Then, it should quickly set the direction of major health policies, and limiting the time to deal with old-style Chinese medicine is only one aspect of it. If it is believed that the political and financial situation is related and cannot be actively carried out, then the scope of health administration should be quickly shown, clearly limiting its years, and allowing old medicine to be physicians is acceptable. Be careful not to listen to sporadic rumors and exaggerated embellishments, which outwardly invite ridicule and inwardly cause division. Then, the country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Jiao Yitang's Appeal to the People on Adopting the National Medicine Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>As for mutual academic research, I am very much in favor of it, as long as they are willing to submit to the truth and turn to science, I have nothing to reject. In February of this year, Lu Jun Yuanlei wrote to me, asking if I would be willing to go to the Shanghai National Medical Branch to assist and serve as a research committee member, but I did not agree to him. I originally wanted to awaken old medicine and mold old medicine. Lu Jun's letter also said that it was sincere and earnest, and that it was out of the sincerity of the gentlemen in charge of the branch. This matter just happened to fit my wishes, so why didn't I agree to Lu Jun? First: I observed that the Chinese people cannot distinguish between emotion and reason. In recent years, most of the people who advocate conserving national medicine are acting on emotion. There are very few who have established a foothold from the perspective of medical theory. Second: I observed that there is no unity within national medicine. On the one hand, they ask me to research and organize, and on the other hand, they scold me as a medical thief. The Changsha Chinese Medicine Association, on the one hand, advocates unified disease names, taking observation as the foundation, Shi Jin-chen, on the other hand, tries its best to oppose it, thinking that it is related to the national system, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, so I think the time is not ripe. Third: Research work requires equipment and a place. Talking on paper is useless. I am afraid that the establishment of a research institute by the National Medical Hall is not feasible. Because of these three reasons, I had to live up to Lu Jun's enthusiasm and could not accept the appointment. Recently, in the August 25th Chen Bao (Chinese Medicine), a gentleman with the pseudonym (Zhiren) also hoped that I would come to lead. Thank you very much for your high regard and kindness, but how can I do it in such an environment? Just look at Mr. Jiao's letter to the people, not a sentence is not slander, not a sentence is not emotional, it is purely emotional, where else is there any medical theory to talk about? Extremely blinded by emotion, what reason is there to say? Alas! Lu Jun! Gentleman Zhiren! Gentlemen in charge of the Shanghai National Medical Branch! It's not that I'm too high, that I have a heart of stone, and that I'm unwilling to mutually verify and research with the national doctors. Gentlemen, look! Working with people who are completely emotional and have no reason, can you guarantee that you won't be hindered in everything? The Buddha said: (If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell?) It is indeed the tone of a great compassionate family, but if going to hell is really beneficial, it may be okay to go there. Gentlemen, look! Working with such people, can you get results? In the end, if you have aspirations but can't achieve them, and nothing is accomplished, one's reputation is not worth cherishing, but for the future of scientification, wouldn't it add another obstacle? Therefore, I believe that in an era when the masses are not yet awake, the promotion of medical theory is still needed. My this discussion is not to embarrass Mr. Jiao personally, but also a tearful appeal to the people. As long as my tongue still exists and the hearts of the people are not dead, China has not been destroyed to the point of exhaustion. My patriotic tears will not dry for a day, and my patriotic blood will not cool down for a day. No matter which side, as long as there is sincerity and reason, we will never refuse mutual research.</p>
<p>As for wanting to become a new medicine after mutual academic research and embarking on a new path, I am afraid it is a bit of an exaggerated delusion. From my point of view, there are three points that can be hoped for. First: To discover several components with excellent effects from our country's medicines and occupy several important positions in drug therapy. Second: To supplement the world medicine that is now specialized in sharp research with a little conceptualization. I have discussed this meaning in detail in my reply to Lu Jun Yuanlei's draft on the organization of national medical academics. Social Medical Report, December 16, 20 years at least to a limited extent, there is one thing that can be done, that is, new doctors use more kinds of domestic drugs and less kinds of foreign drugs, which is not without a little benefit. For example, for diaphoretic and antipyretic drugs, our country also has several kinds of them, and a mild cold can also be cured by sweating after eating them. There are also laxatives, and our country also has rhubarb, mirabilite, etc., and even croton, which can be used for slow or rapid laxatives. If you encounter a disease that can be cured with just one bowel movement, you can use rhubarb, mirabilite, etc., and it will also work. There is no need to use hemp seed oil, fruit salt, and infant self-slices. Also, for those with gastric, the is quite effective, and it is not necessary to use bitter , aromatic , papaya , or Erlich. I think this point can be done. As for new medical matters and new paths, exploring them from the perspective of medical theory is probably an exaggerated delusion of people with abnormal minds.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: Since the Xinhai Revolution, the country has people for Western medicine, opening schools, running colleges, and sending students to study in various countries. The money spent is unknown. After Western medicine is learned, the academic aspect has not been satisfactory, but the capitalist habit has been deeply understood. Every time they see a doctor, the cost of medicine depends on the person and is considered a very normal thing. For example, inspection requires an inspection fee, injection requires an injection fee, and dressing and bandaging require a dressing and bandaging fee. The regular consultation fee seems to be only one or two yuan, but the so-called handling fee can be as high as ten or twenty yuan. I know that Mr. Jiao is ignorant of the academics of Western medicine. The judgment of (not being able to meet expectations) is probably not a word explored from the perspective of medical theory. As far as I know, the scientific medical skills of the Chinese people are indeed becoming more and more powerful day by day, and foreigners are also recognizing it more and more day by day. Compared with foreign countries, it can indeed be on par. Premier said (learning foreign science is not difficult) is indeed true. However, the environment is not good, making heroes useless. They cannot fully display their talents. It is the country and society that have failed the scientific medical practitioners, not the scientific medical practitioners who have failed the country and society. Mr. Jiao! Please think carefully! Our noble Chinese country has always been different from other countries in sending students to study abroad. When sending them, it seems like they are nurturing talents, but when they return to the country after completing their studies, they don't think about the method of using them and placing them. They are allowed to wander around freely, and no one cares about them for the rest of their lives. As a result, those who return to study engineering do business, and those who return to study agriculture rush to become officials, and the business they do and the officials they become are completely unrelated to what they have learned. May I ask how they can display their talents? It is the same across the board, not just medicine. The money is spent improperly, and the money is spent without practical results. It is obviously the result of poor politics and unsound legislation, but we are blamed instead. Is this a conscience-based word?</p>
<p>The words "capitalist consciousness" are indeed correct, and I also deeply feel this pain. However, it is only a minority of people, and it is definitely not the majority. Especially those who are based under the banners of big capitalists, living in Western-style houses, with hot water radiators in winter and air-conditioned rooms in summer, are used to it, but forget that their compatriots in their own country still live in thatched huts. For example, a group of maids in the Grand View Garden are used to wealth and luxury and forget their origins, but they still come to laugh at Grandma Liu. Added to this are factional concepts and snobbish thinking. Thus, relying on the backstage boss of big capitalists, they do their best to fight for the country's face and oppress and exclude poor colleagues who do not seek foreign aid, using all kinds of conspiracies and tricks. Their eyes and minds are only on money. Where do they recognize the country and society? It is natural to squeeze money out of patients for surgeries costing thousands of taels and deliveries costing hundreds of taels. Is there anything to be surprised about? But Mr. Jiao and the people should not mistake the actions of a few people as the sins of the majority to temper a group of scientific medical practitioners. Furthermore, this is personal behavior and has nothing to do with the rise and fall of academics. There is no need to make an issue of it in the selection of items for the adoption of the National Medicine Regulations. I think the article is irrelevant. As long as politics is on the right track, excessive actions in all aspects can be easily improved.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: (The cost of Western medicine is so high that it indirectly increases the burden of disease on the public. Whose fault is this to be blamed on?) According to Mr. Jiao, Western medicine is extremely sinful and deserves to die. Not only has it understood capitalism itself, but it has also induced the children of good families, corrupted the pure minds of the national doctors, and also deeply understood capitalism. Why do they not understand scientific thinking and only increase consultation fees? It can be said that they only learn bad habits and do not learn good habits. Xu Lingyi probably did not have Western medicine at that time. His fee was no less than a hundred gold. From which foreign student did this capitalism come from? Tao Yinju probably did not have Western medicine at that time. His preface to the Notable Physicians' Biographies says: (They fabricate claims and accept a lot of money.) Which foreign student caused this capitalism? Alas! Mr. Jiao! The head of the Legislative Committee of the Legislative Yuan should publish an appeal to the people with considerable prudence!</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: (But if the increased price of Western medicine can really match one penny for one item, it is fine, but when checking the results, it is disappointing. Now, let's take an example of their treatment of cholera: Cholera is an infectious disease with bacteria, and sterilization and disinfection are the strengths of Western medicine. Recently, the health administration in various places is managed by Western doctors. Once an epidemic occurs, it should be able to be suppressed with ease. However, when cholera broke out in Guangzhou last year, the newspapers reported that from June 19th to 21st, in just three days, the sales of coffins due to cholera deaths reached as many as eight hundred, not including those who were too poor to afford coffins. Later, it was heard that both Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces also had this epidemic. The Health Department allocated huge amounts of national currency to send personnel for relief, but as a result, people died in large numbers, reaching hundreds of thousands. These people responsible for health administration, who cannot prevent it beforehand and cannot cure it afterwards, usually only engage in squeezing out national and should not be ashamed of themselves.) This is Mr. Jiao blaming the people in charge of health administration for being incompetent, while also showing that Western medicine is incompetent in treating epidemics. May I ask, where were the national doctors at this time? Where was Mr. Jiao? If you have better methods and superior means, why not lead the talents of your National Medical Hall to apply</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>your abilities and provide relief to the people? You stand by and watch, avoid difficulties and hide your weaknesses. After the storm has passed, you come out to make sarcastic remarks. This kind of behavior is most related to personality. I hope Mr. Jiao will guide the people of the country to a noble path. Alas! My countrymen! The most important method of treating epidemics is to strictly and quickly isolate the first person to develop the disease. Therefore, doctors must have knowledge of infectious diseases, otherwise, the harm to society will be immeasurable. It is truly extremely dangerous. Our noble China usually allows the noble national doctors who are inaccurate in diagnosis and mostly oppose bacteria to fill society. When encountering an evil epidemic, they only recognize it as summer heat and stagnation, delaying the enemy and playing with robbers, allowing it to spread. How can the people who perform the administrative duties of surgery prevent it? When a big fire rages, they do not blame the sins of those who usually oppose bacteria, do not realize the error of inaccurate diagnosis in battle, and do not admit that they are harming the country and the people, but instead blame Western doctors for being able to subdue them at will. It is truly obliterating conscience. May I ask, how many years did Yu the Great spend to control the floods? How long did it take to cure the great floods in the Yangtze River basin the year before last? How vast was the disaster area affected by the epidemic last year? How huge was the amount of national currency allocated? How much is the usual health expenditure? Comparing the right views, it is truly pitiful. Fortunately, there are non-governmental charitable organizations to assist, which can barely cope. Otherwise, it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice, and the in-laws still scold her for being useless. Isn't this too vicious? May I ask, how much is the budget for the National Medical Hall to handle this epidemic prevention matter? What is the plan? What are the methods? Please publish your high opinion, explore it from a medical theoretical point of view, and then appeal to the people!</p>
<h3>Preliminary Suggestions on the Organization of New Drugs</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The flood of new drugs is now at its peak. Shanghai alone has become a battleground for pharmaceutical merchants from various countries. Medicines are related to people's lives. The more medicines there are, the more protected the lives of the people will be. To dislike their abundance and reject them, or to think that they are imported and not use them, are both one-sided views. However, new drugs are of many kinds. Some are effective, some are ineffective, some have drawbacks, and some are dangerous. Foreign pharmaceutical merchants selling good medicines to our country is of course a good thing. However, there are also one or two unscrupulous people who, with the ambition of economic aggression, take the drugs that they dare not sell or test in their own countries, as well as expired and ineffective drugs, and sell them all in our country's markets. Our country's government is used to being subservient to foreign powers and dares not do anything about it. Even if a little restriction is added, they still take a blind eye to our country's public orders. If one or two colleagues in the medical community slightly criticize them properly, they will not hesitate to threaten and bribe them to stifle their words. As a result, all compatriots in the country are trial products of new drugs from various countries! Now, try to look at Europe and the United States. Are there any countries that import foreign drugs without restrictions like our country? Are there any countries where pharmaceutical merchants dare to compete openly without the review of their own government like our country? Speaking of this, I am truly heartbroken. There is no nationality for medicine, only good medicine is good. If it is a good prescription for treating diseases, then there is a need to promote it. However, if the true and false are mixed, then it is difficult to distinguish black and white. If the good and the bad are confused, then it is impossible to distinguish right from wrong. No matter what the matter is, it is the same, let alone medicines that are related to people's lives? At this time when the government has no power to intervene and the people have no ability to identify, there is probably no other way than for us doctors to take on the task of organizing new drugs. The seller of medicine is a merchant, and the user of medicine is a doctor. If we do not increase our rationality, how can we exhaust the policy of using medicine and save people's lives in case of emergency? This is why Dr. Pang Jingzhou proposed the organization of a New Drug Organization Committee at the autumn conference of the Medical Association last year. It has been delayed for a year and has not been implemented, which is regrettable. Although the establishment of this association is named after organizing new drugs, it is actually aimed at promoting good medicines. The more diligent the organization work is, the wider the sales of good medicines will be. Moreover, since medicines are getting better every day, it goes without saying that there is no distinction between new and old, Chinese and foreign. When the country's new drugs are not available, there is indeed a difficult situation of having to use imported good medicines. Therefore, this association is not only something that the medical community should quickly rise up and plan for, but also something that honest pharmaceutical merchants should clap their hands and celebrate. Therefore, I have set out methods to supplement Mr. Pang's proposal.</p>
<p>(1) Notify pharmaceutical merchants across the country to send samples to this association for registration for introduction.</p>
<p>(2) Organize a drug chemical test committee to chemically test the following drugs.</p>
<p>(1) Drugs that do not indicate the prescription and ingredients.</p>
<p>(2) Drugs without instructions.</p>
<p>(3) Drugs that have been reported by a majority of physicians to be of questionable efficacy.</p>
<p>(3) Create a table, and those that meet one of the following conditions will be considered good medicines and included in it:</p>
<p>(1) Those that have been reported by a majority of domestic physicians to be effective in clinical practice.</p>
<p>(2) Those that have been reported by a majority of foreign physicians to be effective in clinical practice.</p>
<p>(3) Those that have been reported by this association to be harmless after chemical testing.</p>
<p>(4) Those that have been reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs to be harmless after chemical testing.</p>
<p>(5) Those that indicate the prescription and ingredients on the seal of the medicine bottle.</p>
<p>(4) Notify the medical community across the country of the above table for adoption.</p>
<p>The above is just my personal plan. As for the steps and methods of implementation, they must still be determined after this association is organized. I hope for it.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Education and the Qualification of Pharmacists in Europe (I)</h3>
<p>The European pharmacy system has been briefly discussed in previous issues of this publication. Its organization is perfect and its business is standardized. In name, it is difficult to call it a store. In fact, it is nothing less than a formal organization for pharmacists to serve society. It has the same meaning as other civil servants working in public institutions. Moreover, medicines are related to life, and the responsibilities of pharmacists are equal to those of physicians. Therefore, formal pharmacies in Europe are all established by pharmacists. In other words, those who have not received pharmaceutical education are not allowed to open pharmacies. This is not an excessive restriction, but rather a focus on people's lives. This is the fundamental point of legislation. The system for establishing pharmaceutical education is based on the system of pharmacy business, and the standard system for pharmaceutical education in various European countries is to balance the experience and theory of students to cultivate qualified pharmacists and talents related to the pharmaceutical industry. Now, I will summarize it as follows.</p>
<p>1. There are dozens of pharmaceutical schools in Germany. The undergraduate program recruits graduates of senior high schools, allowing them to receive five years of on-site practice and two years of pharmaceutical courses. Those who enter the Food Chemistry Department need three years. As for studying for a doctoral degree, it takes about four years. The completion of pharmacist qualification must go through the following three steps.</p>
<p>(1) Preliminary test is generally done by oral examination, written examination, and on-site practice. The qualifications for the test must meet two of the following conditions. (1) Graduated from senior high school and proficient in Latin. (2) Learned from a pharmacist for two years and obtained a certificate.</p>
<p>(2) The state examination (or provincial examination) is also an oral examination, written examination, and on-site test. The qualifications for the test must meet three of the following conditions. (1) Have a preliminary test pass certificate. (2) Have served as an assistant pharmacist in a formal German pharmacy for one year and obtained a certificate. (3) Have studied in the Department of Pharmacy of a German university for two years and obtained a certificate.</p>
<p>(3) Candidate pharmacist After passing the pharmacist examination, they must still complete two years of formal pharmacy internship before they can obtain a pharmacist's license to practice in Germany.</p>
<p>2. The level of French pharmacy universities is quite high. There are Marseilles, Lyon, Kobe, Consetie, Clermont, Frant, and the famous Paris School of Pharmacy. The prerequisite for entering the pharmacy university is to have a bachelor's degree or have a comparable level, and to have one year of pharmacy internship experience. After passing the entrance examination, the study period is four years. (Theory and practice) Only after graduation can one become a pharmacist. After graduating from university, pharmacists not only practice the profession they should have as pharmacists, but also do further analysis for doctors or the public, and other chemical or microscopic work. There are also pharmacists who specialize in chemistry and have special expertise, so they are also called chemists. There are more than 1,000 students in the Paris School of Pharmacy, and girls account for one-third. However, this excessive cultivation is not only for pharmacy practice. The goal is to have graduates with extremely profound scientific cultivation, so there is room for accommodation everywhere. There is no need to make a small pharmaceutical business the only way out. The curriculum for studying for a doctoral degree in pharmacy in French pharmacy schools is a five-year system, that is, after the normal four years, one more year is added, and a thesis is required. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Medicine in the Last Decade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Medical and Pharmaceutical Education and Publications Section Two: Traditional Medicine Education</p>
<p>Those who hold a public-minded view of medicine are inherently few, especially among the wealthy and influential. Therefore, one often hears them lamenting, "Now only Mr. So-and-so is left as a good traditional doctor. His children and grandchildren cannot carry on his practice; they are ultimately much inferior. If this person dies, we lose one." Such tones reveal that even those who are superstitious about traditional medicine are not unaware of the downward trend of traditional medicine. Their mentality, however, is, "As long as I live, I can afford to hire a traditional doctor for twenty-four yuan per house call. I can't worry about the medical care of future generations and the common people." This mentality is entirely the same as that of the wealthy and influential described in the previous three chapters who seek medical care from foreigners.</p>
<p>Another group of influential figures, because they are accustomed to living in Western sanatoriums and also consult traditional doctors for herbal decoctions, occasionally experience minor benefits and become frantically involved in the farce of national medicine institutes. Preserving the national essence and organizing traditional learning temporarily stirred public attention, seemingly as enthusiastic as bodhisattvas. However, one kind of investigation shows that these are originally of no value. In the past two years, criticisms of the National Medicine Institute have been scattered throughout newspapers and magazines. There is no need for me to waste any more ink. Now I only need to introduce two essential articles to the readers, which are enough to analyze the spirit and shell of the National Medicine Institute. One is written by Yu Yunxiu, "(My Views on Reading the Draft of the National Medicine Institute's Academic Organization)," published in the 105th issue of *Medical and Pharmaceutical Review*. The other is written by a Chinese medicine practitioner, "(The Past Incompetence and Future Prospects of the Central National Medicine Institute)." The author is Fan Tianpan, which appeared in the first issue of the journal *National Medicine Review* published in June of this year.</p>
<p>Now I will summarize again: The National Medicine Institute does not dare to imitate the medical practitioners of the Han, Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties, who expounded on Yin and Yang and the six Qi and wrote books to serve as blueprints for future generations of doctors. It only wants to rely on power and influence, to be like the Imperial Hospital of the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing dynasties, and to control its peers. (The National Medicine Regulations' destruction of the administrative system is for this reason). It also does not dare to imitate the traditional Chinese medicine schools of the 1920s, which widely accepted students to create a school of traditional doctors (because the middle school students recruited now can easily overturn their doctrines). It only wants to unite the current important imperial physicians, and then recruit some group doctors who have previously acquired a smattering of modern medicine, to engage in private gain and speculation, forcibly putting a scientific hat on metaphysics, calling it "(using scientific methods to organize traditional medicine)," to deceive the world. There are no scientists in the current National Medicine Institute. If the life of the National Medicine Institute is forcibly maintained by important figures, it is inevitable that scientific scum will be exploited by politicians and attracted by money (people are people, and learning is learning), sneaking in. At that time, various scientific names will inevitably be utilized thoroughly, but the essence of science will still not be developed. Just look at the electric ginseng paste of the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory and the pharmacies that prepare herbal decoctions, which is one example. Fortunately, the definition of the true meaning of science in the minds of important figures is just like this.</p>
<p>As for how to truly view traditional medical books with a scientific eye? Yu Yunxiu's two collections of medical revolution theories have uncovered most of this question. Since the foundation has been overturned, there is really no educational path to be found in traditional medicine. Only drug experience still has the value of being recorded. In short, it is more pleasant to say that we are studying Chinese medicine to preserve national medicine. Although the elimination of traditional medicine is a matter of time, there may still be some twists and turns in the transition. It is expected that if the National Medicine Institute faction gains power, the purely apprentice-based faction will inevitably be squeezed out, because they cannot even wear a scientific hat, and will naturally be rejected by a society that only has a superficial understanding. Therefore, in the call for the scientification of traditional medicine, traditional doctors will have to start a triangular conflict. One is the National Medicine Institute faction, the second is the purely traditional apprentice-based faction, and the third is the enlightened traditional doctors (who are the most sober members of the traditional Chinese medicine schools). At this time, the call of modern medicine is not an attack on traditional medicine at all, but a slogan to influence them, calling out "(The medicine of world harmony is a bright and broad road. Please abandon heresies, and come together, without any barriers!)"</p>
<h3>Preface to Methods of Beauty and Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Our love of beauty encompasses a wide range, such as appreciating literature and art, indulging in music, touring natural landscapes, enjoying the scenery of the four seasons, perusing ancient calligraphy and paintings, bronze vessels, stone statues, and sculptures, all of which are feelings of aesthetic appreciation. Literature, art, landscapes, and scenery are all external things. Although external things are valuable, they are cheaper than our own bodies. If you want to love the beauty of external things, you should first love the beauty of your own body. Therefore, methods of beauty and hygiene are valued.</p>
<p>Europe has a saying "(From the amount of soap consumed, one can judge the civilization of a country,)" which is indeed the most insightful warning about cultural life. A person's cleanliness of their face, cleanliness of their hands, cleanliness of their whole body, and cleanliness of their clothes are not only necessary for personal health, but also give those around them a good impression. This can be called the most important thing in daily life.</p>
<p>There are some in the world who are born with beauty, and there are also some who are born with unattractive appearances. Although it is said that unattractiveness comes from innate nature and there is nothing to be done about it, if one can pay close attention from infancy and childhood, one can also make up for some of the deficiencies of innate nature and make it more beautiful. In modern people who have already entered cultural life, it is especially necessary to use their heads and feet to make themselves satisfied and at the same time give others pleasure.</p>
<p>Recently, it seems that because the call for beauty is very high, whether male or female, they can have techniques that are compatible with the times for their heads, hair, clothes, and makeup, which is really gratifying. However, no matter how complete these techniques are, if the physical body on which they are based has defects such as anemia, tuberculosis, and general weakness, then no matter how perfect the makeup is, it is only a temporary embellishment, and it is not true beauty after all. If you want to show its true beauty, it must be in line with the health of the body. Therefore, regardless of whether you are born beautiful or ugly, if there are any unsatisfactory aspects of your body, you should immediately remedy them. Therefore, beauty techniques should be based on hygiene methods.</p>
<p>I have been paying attention to beauty and hygiene for many years in my spare time from treating diseases. Recently, I have also been practicing physical education. Therefore, I have compiled a book on beauty and hygiene methods, from infants to adults. All posture, walking, appearance, clothing, as well as beauty techniques for hair, eyes, nose, mouth, lips, skin, muscles, breasts, abdomen, hands, feet, fingers, and nails are explained in detail. There are also detailed remedies for congenital defects, such as strabismus, harelip, facial 　, body odor, red nose, baldness, and anemia, all of which are written in detail in the compilation. In addition, facial massage, bathing and hydrotherapy, and light and air therapy, which are closely related to beauty techniques, are all described in detail at the end of the compilation. If scholars follow this in practice, they will not only benefit from beauty, but their whole body will also be healthy. After our body is healthy and our appearance is beautiful, we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of nature in the world, and arrange the utensils in a room, all of which contain artistic ideas, down to the insertion of a flower or a grass in a bile bottle, or the placement of a fist-sized stone or a small fish in a tile basin, all of which are carefully studied for their methods. Wouldn't it be a pleasant thing? The order of research for those who study art should be like this, from one's own body to external things. In the world, there are those who hunch their backs, limp their feet, soil their hands, have haggard faces, dirty clothes, and weak bodies, and call themselves artists. I don't believe it.</p>
<h3>Several Important Discoveries and Inventions in the Development of Modern Medicine (9)</h3>
<p>Z&gt; Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>The rays discovered by Mr. Rontgen are the famous X-rays. Although his discovery was almost accidental, in fact, the basis of this discovery was conceived in the cathode ray research of Mr. Hertz and Mr. Lenard. It is also necessary to briefly describe what these cathode rays are. Around 1730, someone passed an electric current through an induction coil, separating the positive and negative poles by one or two inches, and suddenly saw purple-red firelight shooting out from between them, while also emitting a sound – this is called spark discharge. It was also seen that when the air between the poles was thin, the state of discharge was very different. Later, two metal rods were placed facing each other and sealed into a glass tube, and the air in the tube was gradually extracted. It was also seen that the state of discharge became brush-like, and finally the entire glass tube was filled with brilliant light.</p>
<p>After about a hundred years, Mr. Geissler of Germany modified the previous device. He fused two platinum wires to both ends of the glass tube, and used his own invented mercury air pump to fully extract the air in the tube. As a result of repeated experiments, it was found that when the air was not completely extracted, the tube was filled with purple light. When the air was fully extracted, the light gradually divided into sections, as if they were scales on a snake's belly, and this kind of light was continuous with the positive electrode. As for the negative electrode, there was only a little faint light. This device is today's Geissler tube.</p>
<p>If the air in this Geissler tube is completely extracted, the snake-belly-like texture will expand even more. At the same time, the light emitted by the positive electrode, which almost occupies the entire tube, will gradually shrink and turn into darkness. At the same time, the small light spot on the negative electrode will expand. However, the light from the negative electrode is very thin and not easy to see directly. It can only be proved by the yellowing of the glass tube wall irradiated by it. This is the so-called cathode ray. Mr. Crookes of England should be considered the scholar who thoroughly studied cathode rays, so the vacuum tube that generates cathode rays is called Crookes' tube. The main properties of this cathode ray are roughly as follows: (1) travels in a straight line; (2) generates intense heat when colliding with an object; (3) generates pressure when colliding with an object's surface; (4) can cause substances such as calcium sulfide and glass to emit intense fluorescence; (5) can change direction when encountering a strong magnet. According to subsequent research, it was only known that the substance of the cathode ray is a high-speed electron flow.</p>
<p>When the cathode ray in a vacuum tube travels straight forward from the cathode and collides with the glass tube wall, it can cause it to emit fluorescence. If a metal plate of a certain shape, such as a cross, is used to block it in the middle of the tube, a black shadow will appear behind it.</p>
<p>Later, in 1813, Mr. Hertz embedded a small tin window on the opposite side of the cathode in a Crookes tube. When tested, it was found that the cathode ray could pass through and be emitted. Later, his disciple, Mr. Lenard, further studied this cathode ray that passed through the aluminum window between 1894 and 1895. As a result, in addition to knowing that the properties of this cathode ray were the same as those of the cathode ray in the tube, it was also found that this ray had photographic effects and could pass through objects such as crystal, and could also turn air into a conductor. These characteristics are very similar to today's X-rays.</p>

<h3>The Relationship Between Foreign Rice and China</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>1.  The Source of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>It is impossible to know when foreign rice first became related to our country. According to historical records, in ancient times, we traded with the southwestern barbarians for spices, medicinal materials, and rare items. At that time, the sea ban was strictly enforced, and mutual trade was extremely difficult. Goods that were large in quantity and low in price might not have been in the list of trade items. Therefore, the purchase of foreign rice, as seen in books, was already in the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. The so-called foreign rice was mostly produced in Annam, Siam, Burma, India, Taiwan, Korea, and the South Seas Islands. All the above places, forty or fifty years ago, were mostly not our territory, or were our dependencies. However, after Burma was lost to England, Annam was lost to France, and Taiwan and Korea were ceded to Japan, the rice that supplied the motherland changed into imported foreign rice, which is a source of great pain to speak of.</p>
<p>2.  The Course of Tax Exemption</p>
<p>Our country has always regarded food as the most important thing for the people, so we value storage and strictly prevent smuggling. And food from abroad is regarded as a supplement to our people's food supply, so we attract it and encourage it, and we fear that it will not arrive. The two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong are surrounded by mountains and seas, with narrow land and dense populations, and a serious shortage of grain. Although there is surplus rice from the Yangtze River basin to supplement them, it is still not enough. Therefore, the food supply of the people of Fujian and Guangdong had to find other ways to supplement it. In addition, Ningbo in Zhejiang is also short of rice. In the sixty-first year of Kangxi, the Qing Emperor Shengzu heard that the price of rice in Siam was cheap, with one shi (a unit of dry volume) worth only two or three qian of silver (at that time, Chinese rice was about one liang). Therefore, he ordered them to transport 300,000 shi to Guangzhou, Fujian, Ningbo and other places for sale, exempting it from tax. By the Qianlong period, the tax on the goods brought by the ship was also reduced according to the amount of rice transported. He also encouraged merchants in Fujian and Guangdong to transport rice from Annam, Siam, and other countries back to the country to supplement the supply, and gave them official positions according to the amount they transported. At that time, the ocean was dangerous, and transportation was difficult, and losses were worrying. It was not like today's steamships, which can navigate dangerous places as if they were on flat ground, and have a large capacity and convenient transportation.</p>
<p>Since the sixth year of Yongzheng, imported rice and grain have been exempted from taxation upon deliberation by the Ministry of Revenue, and this has been established as an example. (Domestic rice was taxed, and it was once exempted during the Qianlong period, but it was soon restored.) Later, when the situation of trade between China and foreign countries was formed, and trade agreements were signed with foreign countries, the tax exemption for imported rice and grain was also included in them. The earliest one seen was Article 2 of the Sino-British Trade Agreement in the eighth year of Xianfeng. Later, the same clause was included in the agreements signed with the United States, France, Germany, and other countries. (Note that there are many items listed as tax-free, and it can be said that all items used by foreigners for daily life are tax-free.) Until the Boxer Protocol was concluded, tax exemption was limited to rice, flour, gold, silver, and other items. However, the previous exemption of foreign rice tax was a kind of preferential treatment, that is, even when there was no need for foreign rice to supplement the supply, it could still be taxed. After it was listed in the treaty, it was bound by the treaty, and it changed from the preferential treatment previously granted to an obligation to be jointly observed. After this, if it was desired to levy taxes, it would cause many obstacles. Now that customs duties have been autonomous and flour has been taxed, there should not be much problem with taxing rice and wheat, and even if there are, it is not difficult to achieve this with the power of the authorities to negotiate. (Note 1)</p>
<p>3.  The Trend of Foreign Rice Imports</p>
<p>It is impossible to investigate how much foreign rice is imported nationwide each year. But the quantity must not be large, because at that time, most of the foreign rice was used to supply Guangdong Province, while Fujian still had rice from rice to supplement it. Since the sixth year of Tongzhi, there have been customs records to check for imported foreign rice. However, in the 20 years from the sixth year of Tongzhi to the twelfth year of Guangxu, the amount of foreign rice imported each year was at least more than 6,000 dan, mostly between tens of thousands of dan and hundreds of thousands of dan, and rarely exceeded one million dan. From the thirteenth year of Guangxu to the ninth year of the Republic of China, in the 34 years, the annual import of foreign rice was often in the millions of dan, but it was also difficult to exceed ten million dan. Since the eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China, the rice-producing areas were said to have had a bumper harvest, and they were once exported abroad. Later, due to various reasons, the import of foreign rice, from the tenth year of the Republic of China to the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, in these 12 years, there was a huge amount each year, always more than ten million dan, and the highest exceeded twenty million dan. In order to facilitate reading, a table is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Period Number of Years Approximate Amount of Foreign Rice Imported Annually Remarks</p>
<p>(1) From the sixth year of Tongzhi to the twelfth year of Guangxu 02 Below one million dan In the twelfth year of Tongzhi and the third year of Guangxu, it exceeded one million dan</p>
<p>(2) From the thirteenth year of Guangxu to the ninth year of the Republic of China 34 Below ten million dan In the thirty-first and thirty-third years of Guangxu and the ninth year of the Republic of China, it exceeded ten million dan</p>
<p>(3) From the tenth year of the Republic of China to the twenty-first year of the Republic of China 12 From ten million dan to more than twenty million dan</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the trend of foreign rice imports can be divided into three periods within an indefinite number of years, and the more modern it is, the more imports there are. The reason for this can be deeply thought about.</p>
<p>4.  The Process of the Movement to Tax Imported Food</p>
<p>The idea of taxing imported food was initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Grain and Wheat Committee. The committee was established in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. In June of that year, the committee submitted a proposal to revise the import tariff on food, restrict food imports, and protect domestic agriculture. It was submitted to the authorities, and the Ministry of Finance handed it over to the Tariff Commission for reference. The committee continued to suggest in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, and the Shanghai Municipal Government submitted it to the central government, which stated that the Ministries of Interior, Finance, Agriculture, and Mining would review it separately and then discuss it. (Note 2) In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the Central People's Food Committee also had a proposal to revise the import tariff rates on rice, wheat, and flour. In the twenty-first year, the central government, convened by the Ministry of Finance, held a food conference with representatives from the Ministries of Industry and Interior, and civil affairs agencies from various provinces and cities. The general resolution was (1) to seek free flow within the country, not to levy taxes, and to levy anti-dumping duties on foreign rice. When the price of rice was from nine yuan to fifteen yuan, a 30% decreasing anti-dumping duty was levied, but it was also discussed but not implemented. Since this year, the price of rice has fallen and has not recovered. (But it should be noted that the Shanghai market now uses the market peck, which is more than one dou smaller than the customs peck, so the price should be lower.) The voices of rural economic bankruptcy are also rising. Therefore, the governments of rice-producing areas, such as Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu provinces, in view of the general trend, also telegraphed the Executive Yuan to levy import duties on foreign rice, and many followed suit. The taxation of imported rice and wheat will probably go through the legislative process and can be realized.</p>
<p>5.  The Relationship Between Guangdong Province and Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Over the years, as a result of the adverse effects of various aspects of the country, foreign rice has become an indispensable import commodity (this year is of course an exception). However, the provinces that eat rice but lack rice are Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, and there is also Tianjin in the north. Zhejiang relies on Jiangsu and Anhui. Unless Jiangsu and Anhui have a poor harvest, it will take rice from foreign rice. Fujian still relies on rice from Taiwan for supply (which is also an imported commodity at present). However, the worst rice shortage in Fujian Province is in the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou areas, but it is not as large as the shortage in Guangdong Province. Guangdong, in addition to receiving rice from Anhui, needs foreign rice for its supply due to its geographical relationship, historical relationship, and commercial relationship. Therefore, the relationship between foreign rice and the food supply of the people of Guangdong Province is closer than that of any other province in China. You can see this clearly in the table on the left.</p>
<p>Table of the Amount of Foreign Rice Imported into Guangdong Province (Note 3)</p>
<p>Year Amount Imported Percentage of Total Foreign Rice Imported into the Country</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 1 2,002,923 74.2</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 5 9,783,403 86.7</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 10 8,114,449 76.3</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 16 11,035,140 52.3</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 17 9,388,941 74.3</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 18 7,354,146 67.9</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 19 5,117,801 25.7</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 20 5,447,046 50.7</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 21 13,576,541 63.5</p>
<p>The increase or decrease in the percentage of foreign rice imported into Guangdong Province to the total foreign rice imported into the country is not entirely an indication of a bumper harvest of grain production in Guangdong Province, but a reflection of the poor harvest in rice-producing areas across the country and the shortage of food, which has led to a sharp increase in the import of foreign rice. For example, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, Guangdong Province still imported more than 5.1 million dan of foreign rice, but its percentage of the total amount of foreign rice imported fell to 25.7%. This was due to the poor autumn harvest in the Yangtze River area in the 18th year and the impact of the bandit communists in the 19th year, which led to a sharp increase in food imports in other areas, and the proportion of foreign rice in Guangdong Province unknowingly decreased. (Note that in the year, the ports along the Yangtze River, including Zhejiang Province, imported more than 12.4 million dan of foreign rice.) Since Guangdong Province needs a huge amount of foreign rice every year, there were objections to the proposal to levy taxes last year. However, this year, while the central government is still preparing to tax foreign rice, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance has already announced the imposition of a foreign rice tax: one yuan per 100 jin of rice, and 6 jiao per 100 jin of grain. According to recent newspaper reports, although rice merchants have objections, I don't know what their reasons are. However, it is not a good plan to implement it hastily and give those who oppose the import tax on foreign rice an excuse.</p>
<p>6.  Comparison of Foreign Rice and Domestic Rice</p>
<p>Because most foreign rice has undergone inspection procedures, its grains are mostly clean, dry, and have better expansion properties, and the price is also cheaper. In addition, not only are the provinces that have always lacked rice lacking rice, but the provinces that have always had plenty of rice are also lacking rice at times. This is why foreign rice comes in continuously and money rolls out. However, late rice from Jiangxi and high-quality indica rice from Anhui can also抵御暹邏 rice and No. 1 Saigon rice, and the second can also抵御 No. 2 Saigon rice and small-grained rice. According to inquiries from rice merchants in this city, the price of domestic rice in Guangdong Province is about 5 jiao lower than that of foreign rice. Therefore, if Guangdong levies a foreign rice tax of one yuan per 100 jin, and domestic rice can maintain its original state, then foreign rice, despite its geographical convenience, will not be able to compete in the market after all. This is indeed a fatal injury to foreign rice merchants in Guangdong Province. Unfortunately, the rice-producing areas in our country have been plagued by years of war and bandits, and repeated droughts and floods. The rice industry also lacks proper organization, and the quality of rice is not inspected. The government only cares about financial revenue and has never considered the economy of farmers. Since there is no one who can compete with foreign rice, and transportation is also hindered at every turn, this is why imported foreign rice increases year by year and cannot be resisted. If we still do not take measures to regulate, rectify, and increase production, the result of taxation may still not help agriculture but may harm the people's food supply. This is what we deeply hope that both sides will take into consideration. (Note 4)</p>

<h3>On Levying Taxes on Foreign Rice: A Discussion from the Perspective of Rural Relief</h3>
<p>— Wei Youqin</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>As a result of research into rural relief, proposals have been made in various places for months to require the government to collect a small import tax on rice and wheat. On September 17th, the Shanghai Cereal, Oilseed, and Cake Trade Association sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance, also stating that the reason for the drastic drop in prices of rice, wheat, and flour in recent years is the encroachment of foreign rice, wheat, and flour into the city. Therefore, levying a dumping tax on foreign rice, wheat, and flour to restrict its import is a prerequisite for rescuing agricultural merchants.</p>
<p>On the 18th, Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, made a speech about the future working goals of the National Economic Commission, which included a section on taxing foreign rice. He analyzed the reasons for the blockage of sales of domestic rice and wheat and the low prices, leading to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, as (1) poor rice organization, with merchants in Guangdong and Guangxi mostly ordering rice from Annam and Siam, while the Yangtze River area, although a rice-producing region, actually had reduced sales; (2) high quality and large quantity of foreign wheat, with cheap prices; (3) the customs office has historically not taxed grain imports, thus allowing it to be dumped inland, striking a blow to domestic rice and wheat. President Sun concluded by saying: "When the Ministry of Finance recently revises the new tariff regulations, it will decide to levy taxes on the import of foreign rice and wheat to help the rural areas." At the same time, it was also heard that the five ministries of Finance, Industry, Interior, Transportation, and Railways will also hold regular meetings to discuss taxation methods. Thus, taxing foreign rice already has a trend from suggestion to implementation.</p>
<p>In theory, taxing foreign rice is of course correct, but speaking from the standpoint of rural relief, analysis reveals that some aspects are good, and some are obstructive.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>When we examine the reasons for rural decline and falling prices of agricultural products, in addition to President Sun's issue of quality, there are actually two other most significant reasons:</p>
<p>1.  Market Expansion: This reason is directly related to taxing foreign rice. Originally, China did not tax food, so the import of food has tended to increase year by year. The areas along the trading ports purchase foreign rice. Needless to say, even in the countryside, people purchase foreign rice. In the past, the market was based on a county as a unit. For example, a good harvest this year was considered a prosperous year, and a poor harvest was a sign of rural bankruptcy. Therefore, the prices of agricultural products increased or decreased with the harvest and supply-demand relationship, without special variations. But now the market has expanded, and even with a good harvest, farmers cannot become rich. Because the prices of agricultural products must be viewed in terms of foreign rice and wheat. The quantity of domestic agricultural products is small and cannot affect prices. The market in the past was a local area, a county, or a province, but now it has expanded to the whole world. Foreign rice is cheap, so the price of domestic agricultural products must fall accordingly. Therefore, in terms of this reason, if it is possible to restrict the import of foreign rice or raise the price of foreign rice to increase the price of domestic agricultural products, and at the same time prevent foreign rice from affecting the market price of domestic agricultural products, then taxing foreign rice is beneficial.</p>
<p>2.  Transportation Obstacles: The second reason why foreign rice is pervasive is due to the inconvenience of domestic transportation. If there is too much rice in province A, province B may feel insufficient. The rice of province A cannot reach province B, and province B cannot expect assistance from province A, so both provinces feel distressed. Facts can be found in President Sun's speech. He said: "Merchants in Guangdong and Guangxi mostly order rice from Annam and Siam, and not from within the country." This situation is due to the lack of transportation development. Imagine that it is cheaper to buy rice abroad than domestically, so when province A feels a rice shortage, it is already too late to wait for domestic assistance to arrive, and even if it is transported, the market has already been taken by foreign rice. From this point of view, domestic rice shortages do require foreign rice assistance, and even in good years, foreign rice assistance is still needed. Inconvenient domestic transportation has created an uneven distribution of agricultural products, thus creating the dumping and monopoly of foreign rice. Therefore, the worry about the dumping of foreign rice is not about the dumping itself, but about the domestic need for this kind of dumping. The result of this dumping situation is that agricultural products fall in price, farmers abandon their profession, and farmland is deserted and on the verge of bankruptcy. The method of rescue lies in replacing the position of foreign rice with domestic rice. In principle, this is also beneficial.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>But in fact, there are obstructive aspects. Those who hold opposing views on the tax issue have even proposed a postponement. The proposal came in a telegram from the Shantou Finance Department, which said: "The imposition of import taxes on foreign rice is causing great distress to citizens and chambers of commerce. We request the cancellation of the tax to alleviate the plight of the disaster-stricken people." (Shen Bao, 18th). This is probably also a fact. Although the telegram does not explain the reasons, from the current rural situation, it feels correct and there are two points worthy of discussion:</p>
<p>First: Is domestic rice and wheat really sufficient for self-sufficiency? Our country is an agriculture-based country, with a large land area and many farmers. It should be said that self-sufficiency is sufficient, but from a factual investigation, it may not be so. Some farmers are under the ravages of bandits, some have had their agricultural taxes pre-collected for more than ten years, some are living in flood and drought areas, some are suffering from the unrepaired destruction of war, and some are living by growing opium. Perhaps there are not many who can grow rice and wheat. Usually, under this abnormal state, they rely on rice to survive. Rural people are both producers and consumers of agricultural products. If domestic rice and wheat are not enough for self-sufficiency, and at the same time become expensive due to the taxation of foreign rice, wouldn't that put the entire national food industry in a state of panic? At the same time, food prices will probably rise, and consumers in rural areas will also be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Second: If domestic rice is sufficient, can it be distributed evenly? Even if the domestic food supply is more than enough, the main problem is still whether it can be distributed evenly. If not, it still cannot save the bankruptcy of the rural economy. As mentioned above, the dumping of foreign rice is not worried about its dumping itself, but worried about the domestic need for this kind of dumping. When a province experiences a famine year, it is waiting for food assistance. If the source of foreign rice is faster than domestic rice, it will naturally be more effective. But at that time, because foreign rice already has import taxes, it is more difficult to import. Will this cause the famine area to not only feel a rice shortage, but also suffer from a monopoly? In the Shantou Chamber of Commerce telegram, mentioning the difficult situation, it is mostly because transportation there is more convenient with foreign rice. Once taxed, domestic rice cannot provide assistance, and foreign rice instead rises in price, which is tantamount to courting one's own destruction. Therefore, in this regard, if transportation cannot be developed, then even if the dumping of foreign rice can be prevented, it still cannot remedy the critical situation in the slightest.</p>
<p>The argument of this article seems to oppose taxation, but it is not. The dominance of foreign rice in the country, replacing the position of domestic rice and wheat, with mass production and mass dumping, even if the domestic agriculture immediately revives, without taxing foreign rice, it is probably impossible to say that it can be taken back. Therefore, not taxing foreign rice will make the domestic rural areas decline day by day. However, before the implementation of the tax on foreign rice, we hope to pay attention to two points at the same time: In terms of cultivation methods, it is necessary to improve. Others have modern production, while we still rely purely on human labor. Once a natural disaster occurs, we are helpless. We should study how to increase the production of agricultural products. In terms of transportation, we especially hope that the authorities can properly plan. We should study how to make rice and wheat circulate without obstruction. In this way, after the domestic agricultural situation is improved, on the one hand, we restrict the import of foreign rice, and on the other hand, we allow domestic agricultural products to circulate without obstruction, then the position of foreign rice will naturally tend to fail.</p>
<p>Therefore, observing the taxation of foreign rice from the standpoint of rural relief, it is felt that under certain circumstances, it is possible to negotiate, and even be harmful to the rural areas, but the principle is of course that it must be done.</p>
<h3>How to Properly Handle the Aftermath of Taxing Foreign Rice?</h3>
<p>— Cao Wenhai</p>
<p>Merchants are taking advantage of the time before the tax is levied to transport foreign rice to the province to hoard and speculate. As soon as they hear about the tax, the price of rice immediately rises by about one yuan. Farmers have not yet benefited from the relief, and they are already suffering from the pain of expensive rice. The beneficiaries are rice merchants, and yet the rice merchants are still opposed. This is a matter of business relations.</p>
<p>There is no point in opposing the taxing of foreign rice, because collecting import taxes on foreign rice means raising domestic grain prices to seek the welfare of farmers. However, if there is an oversupply of rice, even without foreign rice imports, the price will still not rise. Maintaining rice prices to benefit farmers seems to be beyond the solution of taxation. Moreover, our country's rice shortage has become a common occurrence. If we do not take advantage of times of surplus to accumulate some reserves, we will inevitably have to beg others in times of scarcity. This year, Japanese rice prices have fallen, and farmers are in distress. Takahashi Korekiyo strongly advocated a national defense policy for rice to prepare for emergencies. The Japanese government is also prepared to buy rice when prices fall to a certain level to maintain them. How deep is this planning!</p>
<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Call Loan Rates Drop Another Three Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the call loan market saw sparse transactions of call tickets, and people were sluggish. In the end, there was no competition, and prices were extremely weak, falling by three points. This was a sharper drop than the day before, and the situation was even softer than last week. Call ticket transactions were also few. Morning trading transfers and new transactions were only 4.12 million, noon trading was over 300,000, and the small general meeting was only over 500,000. There was no news from banks due to the Sunday holiday. On the money shop side, only 25 million in foreign public orders were redeemed, and other foreign transfers were also suspended. Inbound and outbound remittances were over 400,000, and there was no news of customer sources. The difference between Jiangnan small coins and foreign coins was only one jiao. The morning market was 834.5 yuan, and the afternoon market was 834.6 yuan. Trading volume was 6,000 jiao in the morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small coins were 784.8 yuan in the morning, and suddenly rose by one yuan in the afternoon to 785.8 yuan. Trading volume was 65,000 jiao in the morning and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins suddenly contracted by 1,300 wen to 311,000 wen. Trading volume was over 34,800 strings, with a cost of 11,200 foreign yuan.</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Fluctuate Slightly Last Week</h3>
<p>| Securities Exchange Changes Special Securities Full Each Ten Thousand Collect Four Hundred Yuan |</p>
<p>Last week, from September 18th to 23rd, the Chinese Securities Exchange's public bond market, although it was close to the end of trading, did not show any significant signs of friction. Although the number of deposit accounts was high, both sides were very alert, and most had already secretly discussed and swapped values between long and short positions. This method is naturally welcomed by brokers, and it is also very convenient for customers, who can negotiate at any time to avoid the dangers of raising or lowering prices on the trading floor.</p>
<p>Therefore, the trading volume in the market has invisibly decreased greatly. With less trading, market prices naturally fluctuate slightly. This is a general overview of the supply and demand relationship of chips. In terms of the securities environment, there were no significant changes. The situation remained as dull as before. The talk of issuing new public bonds was initially very noisy, but after investigation, it was far from the truth. The rumor of the "96 Consolidation" has been repeatedly publicized, but there is no basis for it. According to the person in charge, it is completely unfounded. This is a general overview of the bond market environment. Most people in the market believe that market prices are still high, and the financial situation, such as the low price of gold and the loss of customs duties, and the original tax revenue is not strong. Therefore, short selling in the market has gradually increased significantly, and market prices rely on this to maintain their stability. This is a general overview of market sentiment. The above-mentioned aspects restrain each other, causing both parties to become even more cautious. Although there are swap transactions in the market, they are few. Therefore, although the market last week was slightly more active than the previous week due to the approaching settlement period, there were still no major fluctuations. The week generally saw more gains than losses. Only on Friday, due to the North China issue, there was a slight drop of two or three jiao. The rest were mostly due to swap relationships between both parties, and market prices generally fluctuated up and down every day, with the difference being very small. Among them, the gains on Wednesday and Thursday were slightly higher, about three or four jiao to half a yuan. Overall, the week generally saw gains of one or two jiao to six or seven jiao. Only the short-term gold rose by eight or nine jiao more. The "96" forward bond still fell by five cents. Judging from its trend, it seems to be slightly firmer, and it is unlikely to fall back before the settlement period. The total trading volume for the week was 39,062,300 yuan, including 27,300 yuan in spot goods and 14,330,000 yuan in salt tax for futures, 4,725,000 yuan in disarmament, 4,400,500 yuan in the "19 Customs Duty", 7,890,000 yuan in the "20 Customs Duty", 3,270,000 yuan in the "96" bond, 2,790,000 yuan in the gold short consolidation, and the rest ranged from over ten thousand to over one million yuan. Also, according to the market notice, starting from the 25th of this month, the special margin for securities transactions, except for the "long gold" and "96" bonds which remain unchanged, will be changed to 400 yuan per 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Overseas Cotton Market is Consistently Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially firm and active due to political news favorable to long positions. Later, it fell back due to Southern hedging sales. As a result, spot prices rose by 35 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 35 to 37 points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 9 points, and futures prices rose by 7-8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 8 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering and speculative buying. The closing price of Pingar rose by 2.5 angles, Umm rose by 7.5 angles, and White Creek rose by 1.5 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (23rd telegraph)</p>

<h3>Grains, Thick Japonica Rice Continues to Rise by an Angle or So</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) The arrival of first-class rice was still scarce yesterday, only numbers 21 and 22. Both retail and wholesale were slightly looser than before, with a total of only 800-900 packages purchased. However, people believe that the rain will lead to a shortage of goods, so it is still firm. Therefore, although the situation is quiet, the market is still tight. The prices of all kinds of thick japonica rice have been raised by an angle or so. Only the new Du Yang Jian had no significant change, while thin rice became stricter among the out-of-town customers, so the prices rose differently. However, the increase was only a few points or an angle or so. Bian Yuan continued to improve, and the new river japonica rice was also quite outstanding. Fragrant japonica rice had no significant fluctuations. The new factory price opened at 7.3 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Zhang Diao Qing Long Silent Resumes Activity</h3>
<p>丨Yesterday Opened Over Seven Hundred Packages 丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was still firm, but there were not many transactions. The Liu disk of the association called 21.85 yuan for ordinary white sand for 24 leases. Number 20 medium sand white and Dutch red were called at the original price, with no transactions. Other transactions were also limited. The Zhang Diao Qing, which had arrived earlier from the Jian gang number house, had been shelved for a long time and had not been opened, and the market was also silent. Yesterday, the market suddenly turned active, and the number house opened more than 700 packages, priced at 14.9 yuan, up two or three jiao from before.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods New Tong Yuan Continues to Arrive Today</h3>
<p>New Tong An Longan, the top-quality large grains, had previously risen by 15 yuan. The number goods had already sold out. It is said that a batch can continue to arrive today, but the number must be small. Market prices may have to rise again, but it depends on the cost of arrival.</p>

<h3>Taking Shortcuts</h3>
<p>(Taking shortcuts) is a term used by clever people to describe agile actions. In other words, (taking shortcuts) means (finding an easier way). Gentlemen who know how to take shortcuts don't need to be down-to-earth, follow procedures step by step, or do things the stupid way. They can build a ladder in mid-air and quickly climb to high positions. Because (doing things the stupid way) is not only strenuous but also doesn't guarantee success or profit. Therefore, (doing things the stupid way) is for hopeless fools. We don't bother talking about it, while our clever and agile people would never be so mindless and unthinking. For example, in school, smart people can take a clever little detour from the first semester of the second grade and jump to the second semester of the third grade. It's even possible to step directly from elementary school graduation into the noble halls of university. After all, the courses that haven't been taken are just that, and luckily, (we are all Chinese), so it's easy to talk things over, and there probably won't be any problems. It's the same in society. Whether in business or officialdom, the happy events of apprentices being promoted directly to shopkeepers, or junior clerks transforming into important ministers, are only accomplished by those who know how to take shortcuts. And speaking of the lower classes, even rickshaw pullers who make a living on the streets can cleverly and nimbly make small turns or take unknown paths to avoid the flying batons of the police, saving their cheap legs from unnecessary swinging and their worthless breath from unnecessary panting. Of course, they can also get a few pennies earlier from the fat bellies of their customers into their rough, dry palms. So, here, we can clearly understand that gentlemen who can and know how to (take shortcuts) not only don't have to be dull and useless like fools but also always get the benefits first! ... These things are truly enviable to fools! These principles are something fools would never dream of!</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, in the world, we Chinese can be considered a nation that knows how to (take shortcuts). Once, a foreign friend told me: (Today can be said to be the time when material civilization has reached its extreme. But this civilization was achieved through our (of course, they meant theirs) long-term research, invention, and improvement, spending (I don't know how much effort, time, and money)! And you smart, lucky Chinese can sit back and enjoy it without lifting a finger. For example, take the car. We (another 'we') gradually and step by step, from the single-wheeled handcart, through countless arduous reforms and evolutions, finally reached what is now called the (1933) latest model! And you Chinese are fortunate enough to leap from sitting in a rough wooden single-wheeled cart in an 18th-century rural valley to being able to sit in this (1933) latest model of car, created through countless hardships! ... Other things like education, social organization, and systems are all the same way.) This foreign friend's words were a bit too harsh, but based on this undeniable fact, we must admit that the Chinese are a nation that is good at (taking shortcuts).</p>
<p>Whether (taking shortcuts) is proper or not, the facts will probably give us the correct answer and lesson. There is no need for us to say more here. However, what we have seen happen before our eyes is that many clever people have properly used the term (taking shortcuts) and have temporarily gotten considerable benefits in this society. So, many pitiful people are very envious and eager to try it themselves, but they can't find the secret entrance or the wide road. Therefore, here, I am selflessly and virtuously revealing the secret of (taking shortcuts) to the world:</p>
<p>(Use...blow...flatter...sell off your own and your companions' interests.)</p>

<h3>A Tragic History of a Dark Family - Admonishing the Foolish</h3>
<p>To be honest, in this remote coastal town of S, which is as small as a bullet, the Li family can be considered a prominent clan. Among the Li family, the Fourth Master is undoubtedly a leading wealthy man.</p>
<p>Because he is a wealthy man with money, the Fourth Master and his wife spend their days indulging in opium dens, puffing smoke and living a leisurely life.</p>
<p>The Fourth Master and his wife are between the ages of forty and fifty. They have only one son and one daughter. The daughter is unmarried, while the son is just twenty years old. In order to settle him down early, they married him off half a year ago. The bride was naturally a daughter from a wealthy family of equal status. The splendor of her dowry was rarely seen even among the wealthiest families in the area. Two large rooms, inside and out, were not enough to display it all, so one can imagine how much there was!</p>
<p>Having married such a daughter-in-law, one would naturally expect them to value her and look at her with new eyes. However, the Fourth Master and his wife did not. The Fourth Master was relatively better, but the Fourth Mistress deeply hated her, constantly scolding her, and simply didn't treat her as a member of the family.</p>
<p>It is said that the Fourth Mistress had her own irrational and self-righteous reasons. On her son's auspicious wedding day, one of the flower candles on the table, the one on the left, inexplicably started leaking oil and quickly burned out. According to her superstitious beliefs, this was a major sign of bad luck! And according to the custom of men on the left and women on the right, it should affect her son. Because of this unconscious suspicion, she began to suspect that the bride was cursed with a life that would kill her husband, and the thought of hatred arose spontaneously. Thus, the tragic history of a dark family began.</p>
<p>After three days, the Fourth Mistress ordered her son to live in a separate room and not to approach her, as if she was afraid of being affected by this cursed person. If the two young people whispered privately, she would immediately put on a stern face and start scolding them, accusing her of harboring evil intentions and seducing men. (Dirty slut) (strange demon)... All kinds of vulgar terms that village women use to scold in the streets would pour out like a string of pearls.</p>
<p>The Fourth Mistress's son was indeed filial and adhered to the (non-resistance) doctrine, obeying his mother's orders in everything. However, he was not without resentment in his heart. Originally, his body was exceptionally weak, and with self-pity, he had become emaciated. Recently, taking advantage of a lapse in vigilance, he secretly went to his wife's room and shared intimate moments with her. Unfortunately, his mother found out and immediately went to bang on the door and shout abuse. This caused him great fear and led to (shock after desire). He also procrastinated and did not seek immediate medical attention. By the time the situation was like a raging fire, he thought of seeking help from medicine. However, even if (Lu) (Bian) were reborn at this time, they would be helpless!</p>
<p>However, the Fourth Mistress did not blame herself for her son's death, but instead blamed her daughter-in-law for killing him. She stomped her feet, beat her chest, and cried and scolded loudly! In addition to (dirty slut) (strange demon)... she added the crime of (murderer). And the most absurd thing was that during her son's burial, in front of many relatives and friends, she recounted how she had killed her husband, in a vivid and almost unbearable manner. Those who heard it covered their mouths in silence, causing the (widow) to be ashamed beyond measure and unable to speak. She could only fall to the ground and wail until she fainted! Fortunately, everyone immediately gave her first aid and revived her.</p>
<p>Later, her brother, XX, told the Fourth Mistress that their mother at home was critically ill and requested to take his sister back home to see her. After repeated requests and the earnest persuasion of relatives and friends, he was finally granted permission to take her back to her hometown. Thus, this lonely widow was able to temporarily leave this dark family and return with her brother. And this tragic story that one cannot bear to finish also came to an end.</p>
<h3>Starting with the Mouth - Ke Ding</h3>
<p>It's truly embarrassing to say that most Chinese people in the city are already immersed in the deep sea of Westernization. Look at what they wear and use, and you can say that seven out of ten are foreign goods. People with slightly higher monthly incomes always want to live in Western-style houses, use foreign goods, and even the food and drink they consume are only foreign goods. What wine, what pastries, what dishes... All kinds of things have to be bought from abroad. Take wine as an example! A bottle of brandy, foreign goods are worth six or seven taels of silver. A foreign cream cake costs at least two or three yuan to buy. And foreign dishes are also extremely expensive. We fashionable Chinese people abandon our own essence to taste the dregs of others. How unworthy is this? So, the Chinese people have still not succeeded in loving their country, because the mouths of the Chinese people are not competitive. You see people on stage saying: Young people should love their country. The first important thing is for everyone to promote domestic goods... After giving a loud speech, he hurriedly goes to a Western restaurant to drink his wine and eat his foreign dishes. In this situation, do you think the word (patriotism) is not being ruined by him? So I say: (Start with the mouth). To know the origin of this sentence, also read what is written below:</p>
<p>(Eating and drinking is a great desire of man). This is an eternal and unchanging golden saying, but eating and drinking too casually can easily lead to illness. Being too casual in the selection of food and drink can easily lead to the pain of national subjugation. In this light, it's better to be casual with eating and drinking than to be casual with the selection of food and drink. Because being casual with eating and drinking and getting sick is only related to personal life and death. But being casual with the selection of food and drink is enough to destroy the country. This is truly a heinous crime. Therefore, in this year of domestic goods, don't talk about other ways to promote domestic goods. Start by promoting domestic goods from the mouth. I think this is just a small matter of the tip of the tongue and there shouldn't be any big problems. For example, today if you want to drink foreign brandy, know that our Chinese goods also have very good brandy. Take it to replace it. If you want to eat foreign dishes, eat our Chinese goods that are also very good. If you want to quench your thirst and drink foreign soda, Chinese goods also have very good soda, and so on. If you want to use foreign goods, change to using Chinese goods. Start changing from the mouth like this. Since the mouth is purely domestic goods, then talking about using domestic goods will be smooth sailing.</p>
