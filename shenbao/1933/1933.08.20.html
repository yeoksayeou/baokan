<h3>爲從事女權運動者進一解</h3>
<p>粤財廳長區芳浦。以所屬女職員競尙炫飾。有失莊嚴。特發通告。加以誥誡。通告中有云。「：：：容飾則曲髮染甲。抹粉塗脂。衣飾則著綠穿紅。爭奇炫異。實屬自貶人格。有失莊嚴。亟應糾正。以挽頽習。：：：」茲事雖小。所關於女權運動者實大。敢申言之。　數年來之我國女權運動。就某一觀點言。顯然已見長足之進步。法律旣賦予平等之原則。社會復容許職業之匀配。而在一般交際塲中。男子所以向婦女殷勤自效者。尤無在不致其委婉謙抑之懷。尊重女性之表現。駸且駕歐美而上之。我國積壓數千年之重男輕女觀念。至是已成粉碎之局面。而久經窒息之婦女生機。乃如雨後蓓蕾。盡情怒放。同屬圓　方趾。本無軒輊可言。吾人對茲發揚蓬勃之女權運動。亦惟攄其熱誠。寄以同情。寗復有絲毫歧視之存念乎。顧從另一方面言之。通常女子。每多富於情感之衝動。而缺乏理智之調節者。惟其缺乏理智故恒不能辨正確之　嚮唯其富於感情。故常不能决當前之利害際茲百凡凌亂之過渡時代。常人行動。旣無明白規條可循。率蹈頽靡蕩弛之習。女子涉世未深每易動其歆羨。狡者小施伎倆。即不難售其奸欺。剽美好之名詞。爲濟惡之工具。固有心人所引爲恫慮者。吾人不敏以爲在今日女權運動中。有兩個條件必須注意者。就女子本身言。應絶對擺脫男子之牢籠政策。以掙取自由獨立之人格。就男子方面言。應澈底泯除褊狹自私之心理。以從事正義人權之扶植。非然者。在男子爲蓄意侮辱。在女子爲自甘没落。皆不足與語女權運動者也。今試問過去數千年中。我國女權。雖常在筦制壓抑之下。寗遂無一時澎漲之現象乎。盛鬋豐容之女性。亦曷嘗不受萬千男子之膜拜頂禮乎。然而所不足稱道者。以其無自由人格而徒仰男子之鼻也。彼固嘗藉炫飾之工巧。以吸收財貨焉。亦嘗憑麻醉之手段。以攫取權利焉。亦嘗形成一時之寵兒。而得恣意所欲爲焉。質言之。非以本人靈魂爲代價。而換取當前之享用乎。其所謂「權。」非完全築於男子意志之上乎。其得多人之頂禮膜拜者。非等於變相之玩弄乎。我國過去數千年所以無女權可言者。蓋即在此。</p>
<p>今日投身職業界之婦女。實際上已爲女權運動者之前驅。其所負之使命旣大其應盡之職責尤切。使此輩能知自靖。則婦女職業日臻發榮女權運動。亦可漸入坦途。否則物議一起。人懷疑慮女權運動且將橫遭打擊而末由前進矣所謂自靖之道有二。第一。在努力技術之修養。第二。在培成儉樸之習慣。技術之修養旣足。則一切抗衡男子。無復有「花瓶」之誚。儉樸之習旣成。則避免他方注目。非分之覬觎可。息區芳浦氏之所以誥誡女職員者。在於崇尙樸素。吾人猶謂兼應注意修養。如此相輔而行。庶幾得所裨補。懸覆轍以爲戒。期來軫之可循。從事女權運動者。可不亟加之意哉。</p>

<p>黃水南岸、决口不止一處、均在魯豫之交、其東南流約分兩支、一經魯西荷澤·曹·單·定陶·嘉祥·金鄉·魚台等縣入微山湖上游之南旺獨山諸湖、一尋廢黃河經豫汴·蘭封·考城·歸德·達蘇省豐·碭·蕭·銅·各縣、折東北流入微山湖下游之昭陽殷山諸湖、</p>
<p>查皇朝經世文編治河篇、及以上各縣志書、并余於民十四年魯曹之遊、沿途視察各河形位、三省交壤處之地形、及現時各地電告水流經過、以及廢黃河底高地丈餘、且北堤决口、觸目皆是、縱人民搶築、勢難不潰、總集各情、敢言决黃當趨微山湖而終止、</p>
<p>又微山湖所以亘蘇魯兩省、歷屬七縣、長約三百里、寬約三四十里、實由明季張鵰翮靳文襄蜚建議、避黃改運設閘蓄湖、得成廣　巨浸也、據漁老傳說、在昔湖深兩丈餘、自淸咸以來、逐年淤淺矣、民十五秋、沛縣大水、曾將水勢投登申報、嗣又經測、最深處丈四尺餘、較七十年前、淤淺六七尺、如此可得一系數、平均每年約墊一寸、再以該年湖水所佔空間、與咸豐七年、黃水北歸時小淸水較略相等、其最十不等也明甚、可知成爲底湖之證、當民則八年、導淮會副工程師·及江蘇水利局主任過沛時、余曾向其報告、備作統治各水之參考、</p>
<p>又湖水出路、僅一久廢淤淺之運河、及不老河上游之滾水雞嘴壩上、聞該壩築製牢不可破、每値大水之際、下游人民預防上游偷掘、日夜廬居壩上、荷槍桿衛、其他則無、識者早鑒及此、曾倡議開雞嘴壩、導不老河、宣洩湖水、墾田以蘇沛民、已非一次、或倡而不議、或議而不决、或决而擱延、皆遭江北一般運治大家阻擱、如歷年揚州運河局評議會季刋、按而可徵、致完納十餘年二分畝捐之人民、徒受蕩家滅頂之厄、思之寧勿慟乎、</p>
<p>再决黃東流、其水勢、浩瀚急湍、其流速、日夜約計百四五十里、其水量、想治黃會諸君子、似亦未能沽測其巨、而以現在微山湖之情形、焉能容納此無盡無已之水、</p>
<p>要知沛縣係屬廣大之平原、地勢較各縣爲低、旣無陵阜嶺崗、堵塞亦自不易、惟有任其汛濫橫流、人没屋墟、惜十餘萬濱湖人民、財產漂蕩、固不置論、其生命究將如何設法指示其避難或逃徙、負人民生命保護之責者、豈能緊打電報、而不火速妥籌拯溺之策乎、」</p>
<h3>馮玉祥南下後之察局達</h3>
<p>方孫等部駐張北口外一帶</p>
<p>宋俟善後有辦法後再回察</p>
<p>張家口通訊、馮玉祥此次毅然交出察省軍政、實有種種困難、不得不爾、當交出軍政電報拍發時、方振武·吉鴻昌·孫良誠等、事前均不知情、其後紛由防地趕回張家口會議、並對馮不謀而行之舉動、有所表示、馮謂另有計較、豈對余等有所懷疑乎、方等見馮態度堅决、始各默然、馮之居住問題、中央主張須在張家口之南、以免受人包圍、方振武吉鴻昌等、力勸馮居張北、嗣經各方奔走、並經韓復榘之邀請、始决寄居泰山、再度深山静養之生活、宋哲元由宣化到張垣謁馮以後、即準備一切、决定帶其衛隊千餘人、由宋陪同到平、再由韓派鐵甲車迎護赴魯、馮於十四日侵晨二時、偕同宋哲元·泰德純·過之瀚·等離開張垣南下、於是察事即告一段落、而今後乃入於善後時期矣、</p>
<p>馮方各部尙有六七萬人、均已退駐口外張北·康保·寳昌·多倫·沽源·一帶、方振武·孫良誠·在張北、張人傑在張北西之村落中、吉鴻昌在多倫、方等在張北另有組織、似尙未能就此抛棄一切、劉桂堂有衆萬餘、所據地區、由沽源直達赤城龍關、是亦察省善後上之一大問題也、</p>
<p>察省政府於宋回任後、同盟軍時代之人員、一律離職、民財兩廳、暫由秦德純·過之瀚·接替、建設廳亦由張維藩暫接、張氏昨晚抵張、今晨到廳視事、宋赴平後、省府事務由秘書長楊鎭南及張維藩等代爲處理、至宋氏此次赴平、一則送馮、一則係與何應欽商察省善後、察局甫定、頭緒紛繁、善後非易、宋氏在平、須商得妥善辦法、始行回察、否則不免又將告退、省府現有之維持人員、宋均以暫維現狀爲囑、其意蓋甚明顯也、</p>
<p>張垣自鄧文在娼寮被殺以後、人心惶惶、馮派張人傑·張允榮·爲戒嚴司令、於八月一日宣布戒嚴、每晚九時、檢查行人、宋部接防之初、亦頗緊張、日來漸定、惟馬路上軍警森嚴、亦非平日所可比擬、宋部均集張垣、宣化由龐炳勛部接防、今日（十四）有龐部一隊開抵張垣、龐將來張組織勦匪司令部、張垣秩序始終保持、雖在大軍雲集之際、亦未發生騒擾情事、惟商業蕭條、達於極點、各業均感衰落、今後政局安定、或可逐漸恢復耳</p>
<p>多倫仍在我軍手中、日僞軍積極西侵、並未大舉來攻、張多電報、昨日起不通、乃係别種關係、與大局得失無關也、（八月十四日）</p>

<h3>黃郛昨晨由京抵滬</h3>
<p>謂救濟戰區須五千萬</p>
<p>察事善後在軍隊安置</p>
<p>將赴莫干山旬餘返平</p>
<p>行政院駐平政務整理委員會委員長黃郛、前由平赴贛、謁晤蔣委員長、報告華北近况、並請示一切、前日由贛返京、當晚乘京滬夜快車來滬、昨晨七時四十八分抵眞茹車站、據黃氏表示、來滬並無特殊任務、日內擬赴莫干山稍事休養、十餘日後再行返平視事、各情分誌如次、</p>

<h3>戰區救濟當務之急</h3>
<p>昨晨十時、黃在寓次、</p>
<p>延納各報社記者、據黃談、華北因戰事影響、</p>
<p>政務整理、一時尙談不到、此次華北戰事之猛烈、早爲一般人所明悉、參戰軍士、凡四十餘萬、八倍於淞滬之戰事、戰區之大、又數倍於淞滬、淞滬之戰、爲時不過月餘、華北之戰、竟有五閱月之久、是以損失之大、實較淞滬尤甚、其　眞不可勝計、戰區災民、流離失所、慘不忍覩、若不早施救濟、前途更不堪設想、故辦理戰區</p>
<p>救濟、實爲目前當務之急、况値兹中央在財庫極度支絀之下、猶能撥現欵百萬、及公債四百萬、充作戰區救濟之費用、雖屬杯水車薪、要亦極爲難能、若欲全部完成救濟、則非五千萬不爲功、今所得者、僅先稍施急賑、爲初步之救濟而已、整個辦法、尙待研究並進行接洽也、</p>
<h3>察省善後有兩要點</h3>
<p>至察省問題、表面業已</p>
<p>解决、馮已離去、宋亦</p>
<p>復職、惟善後尙餘兩點</p>
<p>、（一）馮在張北、收編　色軍隊甚多、急待編遣、已下命各駐原防待命、（二）日方藉口馮破壞恊定、再佔多倫、須交涉交還、惟情形複雜、困難尙多、馮方將予名義否未定、</p>
<h3>灤東日軍三處未撤</h3>
<p>現灤東各地、我方已次</p>
<p>第接收、日軍未完全撤</p>
<p>退者、尙有三處、一爲</p>
<p>興隆縣·一爲都山·都山非縣治、曾設設治局、兩處其半在長城以外、其半在長城以內、現在長城以南者　、已經我接收、完全收回、須待解决長城各口時再談、一爲臨榆縣華北戰事發生後、臨榆縣署文件卷宗、即移海洋鎭、現縣長仍在海洋鎭辦公、臨榆尙有日軍、短期內必可撤退、</p>
<h3>僞軍改編最爲費事</h3>
<p>尤有一點、尤較淞滬之</p>
<p>戰爲費事、即日在　東</p>
<p>一帶製造二萬餘僞軍、</p>
<p>蓋淞滬接收時、日軍一退即可接收、漢奸祗一無力量之胡立夫、而華北有李際春·李壽山·石友三·等、皆須措署妥當、方可進行、現李際春部一萬二千、已編遣爲四千、李壽山部八千、自號東亞同盟軍、現已盡調關外、石友三部現祗七百餘人、紀律尙好、惟將來或予遣散、或加改編、現均未定、</p>
<h3>一二日中赴莫干山</h3>

<p>蔣委員長、係報告華北</p>
<p>情形、並請示一切、本</p>
<p>人北上時、即表示凡有利國家、願犧牲一切、始終未計功過、故千秋萬世任何批評、均非所計及、此次來滬、略事休養、擬赴莫干山一行、確期現尙未定、大約即在一二日內云、</p>

<h3>淸查救國捐欵</h3>
<p>九四老人意見</p>
<p>馬相伯對於淸查救國捐欵之意見云、週近上海有若干團體、對於救國捐欵之處署、特組織救國淸欵會從事淸查、李杜且自廬山兩函朱慶瀾氏、質詢多點、聲色俱厲、此種負責之公開檢舉、尙屬革命以來之創舉、而同時事實以辯而愈明、公道亦以辯而愈判、但使檢舉者能保持嚴正之大公態度、一本事實、不存偏私、不以檢舉爲達到某種目的之手叚、則在被檢舉者當正無不樂於接受也、然而余於此次對於朱慶瀾氏與後援會等之攻擊、終恐其近乎有意爲難、或含有另種作用、未能保持嚴正的態度、而上海多數歷史悠久之公團、對此軒然巨波、竟持隔岸觀火之態度、無有公正之表示、舉世滔滔、無公道、無是非、一任黑白淆亂、正義銷沉、余尤爲之疾首痛心、余老矣、於世旣無所忤、於物亦無所爭、但於此種不平之現象、則殊不願默不發言、茲謹一言之、第一、朱氏公正廉潔之人格、夙爲國人所共信、彼曩年主政黑龍江廣東各地、政績斐然、甘棠之思、今猶示衰、卽如彼前年辦理救濟水災、苦心擘劃、不枉費、文、其公正廉潔、已爲國人所共睹、當時海外僑胞、以及國內捐欵者、但得朱氏一親筆收據、卽深信其所捐之欵、必能用之正當</p>
<p>、且有不辭跋涉、必將捐欵親交朱氏者、其得人</p>

<p>西遊記當然是一部很好的小說。他那精　的結　美麗約煊染，巧妙的譽喻，和許多想入非非的杜　的情節，確有令人傳誦百世的價値。不過，其中關于猪八戒一部份的記載，在前幾年却曾一度受過我們幾個小說迷的攻擊。因爲那時候我們涉世未深，滿肚裝着那些大聖大賢們的高調式的格言，以爲種瓜定能得瓜，種豆自然得豆，像猪八戒這樣一個貎似憨直，心實奸邪的脚色，一路上旣不能除妖縛怪，保矆唐僧，反一味濫觸齊天大聖的壁脚，弄得他們師徒不和，幾次三番，使唐僧身陷妖窟，險些一命嗚呼。再加他色心不改，一見女人便思染指，蜘蛛精，白骨夫人，觀音菩薩，他都曾很熱烈地追求過，像這樣七情不斷的東西，怎麽還能算得修行人呢？再加他每當碰到了什麽危難的時候，總是第一個大喊「散伙」「散伙」，道心之不堅，可謂已達極點。雖然曾有「荆棘林悟能努力」的一番小殷勤，却也小善不抵大惡，相差還遠。依我們說，賞他個全屍回東，已算是額外開恩，怎麽後來還給他身登天竺，榮封「凈壇使者」呢？佛祖豈不太糊塗了嗎？若不是佛祖糊塗，定是做書人的漏洞了。以上是幾年前，我們純粹從理論方面所定的學說。如今閱歷漸增，再仔細想想，方覺我們自已是錯誤了。理由是猪八戒的眞本領雖不行，馬屁功夫却委實高明，你看唐僧對于他是何等的寵愛，可見唐僧不但不曾看出他的歹處，反覺得他是千好萬好，因此當他老人家到了靈山之後，一定在佛祖面前竭力保舉，很替他說過一番好話，幸而佛祖的頭腦，畢竟還淸楚，所以祗賞他一個「使者」，而不曾封他一個南無什麽佛。這種事實，看去好像是做書人的矛盾，其實他老先生却是苦口婆心，暗中在那裏指點你們呢？但看如今那一般學着猪八戒的樣，不做實在工夫，專工拍馬，一味觸好人壁脚的朋友，那一個不得意呢？再加如今那些高居人上的仁兄，頭腦來得糊塗，因此凡抱「猪八戒主義」者幾乎個個都能成仙成佛，享盡人間富貴，而西洋鏡亦永無拆穿之日，所以，現在我是大澈大悟了，西遊記不僅祇是一部絶好的小說，而且還合蓄着半部「處世要訣」咧！我願大家都來提倡「猪八戒主義」！</p>
<h3>冰話</h3>
<p>— 褚劍屏</p>
<p>一塊整塊的冰，如果你用</p>
<p>鋸鋸開了，或是用鐵鎚打碎之後，便永無復合的時期了，這宛比是我們貴中華民國的國民性，老總們没連絡的劣根性。在飲冰之後的刹那間，頓覺心地淸醒，知覺靈敏，但是等到凉性一退，便依然昏悶糢糊了。這好似我們每逢受到了一次國恥，就大家其勢洶洶的興奮一下，等到相當的時期一過，却又沉默寡言了。</p>
<p>把一塊塊挺硬的冰塊，投進了搖冰器，做成了甘美的冰結漣，以快人們的朶頣，好似我們許多搞敵軍和義勇軍的爲國捐軀：他們雖都是些堅强不屈的忠實分子，但是到底受不住帝國主義精銳利器的折磨，結果都成了齎粉，而塡了敵人的貪壑。</p>
<h3>日本女子</h3>
<p>— 翼</p>
<p>在近幾年新小說裏所看到的日本女子，無不是可愛的：尤其是陳季常之流，不但覺得可愛，而且不免自咎，怎麽不娶一個日本女子，一生享受妻的尊敬和體貼呢。據說：凡是在小說裏寫到日本女子的作家，都曾到過日本，親眼看見，一點也不訛錯。所以日本軍閥儘管兇惡地侵略中國，中國作家儘管呻吟在國難悲慘氛圍中，而在小說裏寫到日本女子，依然是那樣可愛：這就因爲日本女子可愛，是確確實實的事，不能故意把事實寫成相反。試看，我們的作家總不曾把日本軍閥的面目也寫成可愛罷。</p>
<p>本來，老早就有人發過三願了，那三願呢？其中之一就是要娶妻願娶日本女子，又其一好像是喫飯願喫中國菜，再有一願，却已想不起是什麽來：可見世人想娶日本女子爲妻的，必不在少。誰知竟也有例外，日本女子並非人人可愛的，這例是一奇！如最近南通發生之一案，據十二日本報載：南通大學醫科敎授黃裕綸，近與其日籍夫人大塜金子感情惡劣，大塜竟以刀殺黃，經黃避免，乃向法院控告伊妻殺人：檢察處定十四日偵訊，並傳黃之八齡長子到庭作證。　僅僅感情惡劣，就拿刀殺起丈夫來，黃裕綸是幸而避免，不然，或已死於刀下，也未可知，這竟比較中國的悍妻還要悍得幾倍，比較日本軍閥的兇橫面目，和其殺人如麻，也就差不多的了！何以我們的新小說裏，日本女子總是那樣地可愛呢？</p>
<p>有人說：日本女子確是人人可愛。祇是中日兩民族已有了貴賤高下之殊，所以日妻華夫就不能與日妻日夫一槪而論，如果有願娶日妻，那就非先努力於提高民族地位不可。這倒也說得是！~</p>
<h3>市立動物園雜寫</h3>
<p>— 俊恩</p>
<p>文廟對面的動物園開放啦！我和雪懷着滿肚子的游興跑到了動物園，售票處的人們是那樣的擁擠，手中儘捻着銅板，口中儘喊着「二張二張」，賣票員眼風也不對你飄，眼見票擠上了，又被那可惡的大胖子帶了出來。好啦！票子搶到手啦！擠開一條出路，和雪拔脚往裏就跑，管它媽的紛香和汗臭！·</p>
<p>扯過票，一眼便瞥見一座大大的籠子，上面蓋着片片的蘆蓆，裏面有各種各樣的飛禽，有小小的假山，也有淺的池塘，更有深深的噴泉！可惜噴得不高。　拂着依依的埀柳，繞過一灣綠水，是走獸啦！那滿身金錢團團作富家翁似的豹兒，兀自在籠中踱過不住，嗅嗅鐵網，又望望籠外的人們，顯然的，它懷着不良的企圖，可是籠門是緊緊的閉着，它只有　，如村學究做詩一般的　來　去，也許是在細細的思量吧！</p>
<p>那虎，可瀨啦！儘躺在狹小的籠中，儘人們大聲的喊呌，甚至蓬蓬的敲着籠後的鐵門，它只給人們不理不睬，眞好鎭静的工夫</p>
<p>好啦！那號稱獸中之王的獅子竟睡着啦！儘讓籠外的人們覬覷嘲笑，儘讓年靑小夥子對着鏡頭拍照，它只是苟且地躺在日光勢力不及的陰處，一聲兒也不響，如果你說它没有睡，那麽它在做什麽？唉：睡獅呀！你將何時醒呢？</p>
<p>男人，女人，小孩圍着在看猴子打架，孩子看得嘻開着小嘴儘笑，一個老頭兒撚着鬍子道：「特格兩隻油煎，同類還要打架，打撥啥人看？」衆人聽了，不由得對他望了一眼。</p>
<p>狐，狸，黑熊安閒的躺在籠中，地上丢着一塊塊的牛肉；那籠，一半兒露天，一半兒在屋內的，許多人見了，不覺喟然嘆道：「人也嘸没格能適意，格兩隻衆牲眞眞好福。」，</p>
<p>閒漢們，有的在假山洞中打盹，有的在芳亭上乘凉，頑皮的孩子們在玩「老虎山」的把戲。</p>
<p>日光射得腦門有點發昏，全園竟然找不到一處適當的遮蔽處，於是不得不同雪從「出口」溜出來；雖則路傍的標準鐘上還不過指着上午十時，但那扯票處的字紙籠却已吃得飽飽地了，</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十三回</p>
<p>棄職見知音佳人默許</p>
<p>承家得來者健兒狂歡</p>
<p>江氏看着，忙着連連搖手道：酒倒罷了。我是一點兒也不能喝。趙翁笑道：您不喝，我也不讓我心裏一高興，自已就要喝上兩鍾，您只管吃飯，我喝酒陪着。他如此說着。已經坐下來了。江氏知道這個老頭子是個直爽人，倒不用得怎樣的虚謙，也就在他對面位子上坐下了。趙翁先端起杯子來，抿了一口酒，點着頭微笑了一笑。他雖没有說什麽，好像很贊成這酒味之美。這一口酒，也就像什麽提神藥一般，他喝過之後，神氣就來了。他笑道：楊老太；多謝你的美意，剛才關連長來說，您已經答應這件親事了。我眞樂得什麽似的，馬上就要找酒喝。照說，我那孩子眞配不過你家姑娘，不過他倒是個實心眼子。江氏笑道：關連長也說了、說是我不歡喜軍人，他情願把事情辭了。我一想這是什麽話呢？作親戚的，有個不願親戚好的嗎？爲了親事，倒把前程抛了，這可是鬧反了。趙翁道：不暪您說，以前我這孩子去當兵，我倒没有什麽主見，他愛怎麽辦，就怎麽辦。後來他慢慢的往上爬起來，我就讓他幹到底了。第一呢，一個人挖井，要挖一口井，老往下挖，總會有水。若是挖了幾丈深，見不着水，又去重挖一個地方。那末他就挖一輩子的井，也不會見着水。我這孩子，已經投軍這些年了挖井挖了一大半，我也只有呌他往前幹。其二呢，我生平就是這樣說，拿着人家一分錢得替人家作一分事。俗言道得好，養兵千日，用在一朝，現在國家正用得着軍隊的時候：：：江工道：老太爺，您這話對了。（一六三）</p>

<h3>三角游泳賽西靑包辦冠軍</h3>
<p>中華第二日本第三個人冠軍亦屬西靑</p>
<p>八項比賽之第一亦均爲西靑選手包辦</p>
<p>中華選手已有相當進步惟轉身稍遲緩</p>
<p>中華西靑及日本之三角游泳賽、於昨晚八時半在西靑游泳池舉行、觀者滿座、興高采烈、每項競賽、觀者咸報以熱烈之掌聲、西靑隊人才濟濟、包辦團體及個人錦標、每項節目之冠軍、亦均爲西靑選手包辦、成績殊見出色、中華與日本競奪亞軍、異常激烈、總結果西靑以四十六分得錦標、中華第二、二十五分、日本第三、得十三分、賽畢由葛雷博士給奬、富民杯爲西靑保持一年、八項比賽中、除兩接力游外、西靑之哈特萊、海勤斯丁及羅根三選的和各勝二組、哈特萊精短程急進、功夫殊佳、海勤斯丁勝俯游及仰游、羅根則富於長力、故二百及四百四十碼自由、均屬羅根、哈特萊因又參加兩接力賽、故得個人總分第一、共十六分、第二海勤斯丁因僅參加一項接力游、故以十三分居第二、羅根第三、得十分、</p>
<p>四百四十碼自由式泳、中華陳玉泉與西靑羅根、競爭甚烈、在三百碼前、陳約在羅根前一碼半、惟羅根不急不慌、順水推進、態度極爲從容、一望而知深具造詣者、至三百五十碼時、羅已追上陳、而後潑水激進、速率大增、至終點、羅反勝陳玉泉一池之長、計二十五碼、</p>
<p>二百碼接力賽、西靑選手興波作浪、步步爭先、中日遠非其敵、惟亞軍之爭、中日選手異常激烈、至終點、中華僅勝日本一尺耳、西靑隊以一分五六秒二、破二分五秒二之西靑游泳池紀錄、一百五十碼混合接力、中華與西靑有劇烈競爭、因中華屢次屈服於西靑之下、冀爭最後一項之混合接力冠軍、第一程中華楊元華與西靑馬發脫之仰泳、軒輊難分、第二程中華黎日新與西靑海勤斯丁、仍在水平線上、惟第三程自由式、西靑起用名將哈特萊、卒壓倒中華李榮耀、而得第一、中華仍未能償其冠軍夢、西靑隊之時間爲一分三六秒二、亦破一分三九秒之西靑游泳池最元紀錄、</p>
<p>綜觀此次中華選手成績、均有相當進步、如李榮耀楊高華陳玉泉黎日新林江水等、功夫均有可觀、惟名將尹衍均未見進步、又小英雄胡其傑之花式跳水、博得觀衆掌聲不少、中華選手最大弱點、由於轉灣太遲、亟宜注意、</p>
<p>計分法、除接力以五三一計算外、餘爲五三二一、個人算分、亦以五三二一計算、惟參加接力賽得第一者、另加三分、三隊得得分如下、</p>

<h3>萬國網球賽昨日雙打中又勝美得决賽權</h3>
<p>日本棄權葡占勝</p>
<p>今日下午三組單打比賽</p>
<p>上海萬國網球扶輪盃、昨爲複球第二日、中美之逐鹿、葡日之競爭、均視是日雙打勝負之轉移、而定其將來之命運、中美苦戰五盤、結果三比二、遂以兩勝單打一勝雙打、三比零敗美而得决球權、葡日旣各勝一組於前、勢必力奪雙打、以占優着也、果然、葡日形勢緊張、變化萬端、要非木村年老力　乏、腿筋抽痛、自行放棄、則葡之獲勝、尙須一番惡門也、葡以二比一居前、今日但須一組勝利、卽將與中華參加奪標、事實上之觀察、今日柯拉沙之勝須藤、或非一困難問題也、</p>
<h3>中勝美苦戰五盤</h3>
<p>令人一驚四時半、中美揮拍應戰、史密斯在其猛烈發球之下、占得上風、余田光過於謹愼反誤大事、第一局勝利、遂歸美人、鄭兆佳繼之、經幾度掙扎、方奪來第二局、成各一之比、第三第四第五三局連屬美人、但第四第五兩局、中華恒在優越形勢中、自趨自敗、　　爲之　　、旣而第六局鄭以供球之峻急得之、不料轉眼又失第七局、第八局之歸中華、余之力也、其時美以五比三領先、第九局乃成中華生死之關鍵、美國二將、羣集中余氏、一再不已、終得勝利、以六比三完第一盤、</p>
<p>形勢緩和　中華先負一盤、似有一面倒趨勢、然而一對滿腔熱血之少年戰將、奮發猛進、未嘗少减其雄心、且久未裘演之佳妙合作、又重見於眼前、雙方形勢、遂趨和緩、戰幕再起、互以供球而得勝利、至三三之後、輪及余氏發球揮拍殺去、每中對方要害、乃以四比三占先、史規亞供球不利、自殺累見、一發不可收拾、均衡之勢方破、鄭氏再以壓劈抽擊之法、連敗敵人、第二盤六比三之勝利、乃歸中華、</p>
<p>大功告成　第三盤、彷彿與第二盤相同、又各以發球而互得局數、在四四之後、變化忽生、當時美以五比四在前而鄭氏之發球、則突告失敗、而是盤命運亦從此終了、結果美以六比四得勝、第四盤余氏表演特佳、初雙方尙堅持不下、殆至二二之後、美人陣綫搖動、無法招架、中一氣呵成四局、以六比二勝第四盤、第五盤作、戰時、暮色四起、觀者不易辨别、戰者更難觀察、利於供球之峻急、攔網之神速、氣壯心定、尤爲重要、而勝利之來、則固全在此數點也、中華鄭余二將、頗有特殊成績、二二之後、幾爲其探制、終以六比三占勝、結果六比三大功告成、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳　余田光（中）｛三Ｉ六六Ｉ三四Ｉ六六Ｉ二六Ｉ三｝美史密斯史規亞</p>
<h3>日棄權葡人占勝</h3>
<p>功虧一簣　是組起於三時、葡人Ｓ柯拉沙、戰來最有精彩、考司坦失其常態、首二盤之失敗、咎在後者身上、惟二人體力健强、終占上風、日人木村野口、均係善戰之士、第一盤以六比二勝、似乎全不費事、第二盤勝負之定、過於久長、而至於二十局之多、日人　勝、而肌力全○失、第三盤乃以二比六失敗、第四盤四四平手之數方見、木村腿筋抽痛、不克作戰、自行棄權、而予葡人今日權優勝之形勢也、當日未完比數如左</p>

<h3>今日三單打秩序</h3>
<p>中華旣以三比零勝美國、獲得决賽權、今後與美之兩組單打、無關出入矣、葡萄牙在形勢較佳之下、必不甘自放棄、且其人才又出衆、日人如欲挽回乾坤、恐難成事實、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>爲翻譯辯護］</h3>
<p>— 洛文</p>
<p>今年是圍剿翻譯的年頭。</p>
<p>或曰『硬譯』，或曰『聽說』現在有許多翻譯家：：翻開第一行就譯，對於原作的理解，更無從談起，』所以令人看得『不知所云』。　這種現象，在翻譯界確是不少的，那病根就在『搶先』。中國人原是喜歡『搶先』的人民，上落電車，買火車票，寄掛號信，都願意是一到便是第一個。翻譯者當然也逃不出這例子的。而書店和讀者，實在也没有容納同一原本的兩種譯本的雅量和物力，只要已有一種譯稿别一譯本就没有書店肯接收出版了，據說是已經有了，怕再没有人要買。</p>
<p>舉一個例子在這里；現在已經成了古典的達爾文的『物種由來』，日本有兩個翻譯本，先出的一種頗多錯誤，後出的一本是好的。中國只有一種馬君武博士的翻譯，而他所根據的却是日本的壞譯本，實有另譯的必要。然而那里還會有書店肯出版呢？除非譯者同時是富翁，他來自已印。不過如果是富翁，他就去打算盤，再也不來弄什麽翻譯了。</p>
<p>還有一層，是中國的流行，實在也過去得太快，一種學問或文藝紹介進中國來，多則一年，少則半年，大抵就烟消火滅。靠翻譯爲生的翻譯家，如果精心作意，推敲起來，則到他脫稿時，社會上早已無人過問。中國大嚷過託爾斯泰，大嚷過屠格納夫，後來又大嚷過辛克萊，但他們的選集却一部也没有。去年雖然還有以郭沫若先生的盛名，幸而出版的『戰爭與和平』，但恐怕仍不足以挽回讀書和出版界的惰氣，勢必至於讀者也厭倦，譯者也厭倦，出版者也厭倦，歸根結蒂是不會完結的。</p>
<p>翻譯的不行，大部份的責任固然該在翻譯家，但讀書界和出版界，尤其是批評家，也該分負若干的責任。要救治這頽運，必須有正確的批評，指出壞的，奬勵好的，倘没有，則較好的也可以。然而這怎麽能呢，指摘壞翻譯，對於無拳無勇的譯者是不要緊的，倘若觸犯了别有來歷的人，他就會給你帶上一頂紅帽子，簡直要你的性命。這現象，就使批評家也不得不含糊了。</p>
<p>此外，現在最普通的對於翻譯的不滿，是說看了幾十行也不能懂。但這是應該加以區别的。倘是康德的『純粹理性批判』那樣的書，則即使德國人來看原文，他倘非專家，也還是一時不能看懂。自然，『翻開第一行就譯』的譯者，是太不負責任了，然而漫無區别，要無論什麽都翻開第一行就　的讀者，却也未免太不負責任了。</p>
<h3>祖國與用武之地</h3>
<p>— 索原</p>
<p>「新中華」第十期上有篇張夢麟先生的「英語八五運動與基本英語」，後來就改題「基本英語的由來」，收在「基本英語文法」內，作爲該書的第一章。這篇文章，不祗簡要地說明了什麽是基本英語，並可藉此窺見基本英語首創者以及中國提倡者的對於言語問題的意見。其中有一段是關於國際語問題的，張先生以爲ＶolepukEsperantoipo等「人爲的國際語」，「雖各有幾萬乃至幾十萬的贊成者，但是仍是流行不廣」。原因在什麽地方呢？第一，「乃是這些世界語，不是自然發生的，活的國語，而是人爲的，死的東西」。第二，「學這種語言，等於另學一種外國語」。第三，「而且它没有祖國，即學出來，也没有用武之地」，所以「都已不能號召了」。於是乎「便生出一種自然的，活的國際語來了」。是怎樣的「活的國際語」呢？張先生說了：「這個國際語，老實說，即是英語。」這言語的「商標」呌做「英美科學國際商用英語」，「由這幾個英文的首字」，於是「定名爲基本英語」。</p>
<p>對於張先生的意見，我是不能同意的。人工國際語的方案，自十七世紀到現在，爲數不下數百餘種。而只有Ｅsperanto（世界語），在四十六年來的歷史中，目擊其他國際語的淘汰與死亡，漸次被應用於各個部門，不絶地發展着。其他人工國際語的死亡，其原因並不在於「人工」，而有着别的原因的，Esperento之能生存到現在，就是證據。所以雖然同樣地是人工國際語，把Esperanto和其他國際語併爲一談是不公允的。</p>
<p>其次，關於言語的死活問題，其標準决不在這言語是否「活的國語」有無「祖國」或「用武之地」，而在於這言語是否被人應用。最顯明的例，譬如拉丁語，無疑地曾經是過「活的國語」而且也有過「祖國」和「用武之地」的，但是現在還有誰敢稱它爲「活的」言語呢？至於Esperanto的被人多方的應用，更是無可否認的事實。中國就從Esperanto中譯過許多文學作品，「莫斯科印象記」和「新俄游記」，兩部單靠了Esperanto而旅行蘇聯的游記，更實證了這言語的實用性。將在莫斯科舉行的萬國工人運動會，也已决定一切口令都用Esperantoo其次，說學習Esperanto「等於别學一種外國語」，那倒是實在的情形。但是學基本英語，難道就不「等於另學一種外國語」嗎？我們現在還不是印度人，張先生的理由是不成立的。</p>
<p>再次就是Esperanto「没有祖國」，也没有用武之地」。那倒是千眞萬確的。唯其「没有祖國」，所以配做國際語」。要是它的「祖國」是美國或英國，雖可藉此發財，做買辦或上倫敦向英皇拜領勳章，「用武之地」是有了，但恐不會有「幾十萬的贊成者」了。</p>
<p>把某種民族語來當作國際語的一切的企圖，由來已久，將來也難免再來幾次，縱然它有「祖國」和「用武之地」，也終於要失敗的。而Esperanto將在「没有祖國」而需要國際團結的人們手中不絶地生長，一切來自有着「用武之地」的人們的反對，是絲毫不足損害它的。</p>
<h3>工場街</h3>
<p>— 林翼之</p>
<p>縱使不是在這樣的黃昏時候，工塲街也永遠顯着陰森。九十幾度的熱炎重重地壓住了街頭的沙塵，一江碇靑色的濁水一動不動的沉澱着，散放出陣陣的阿摩尼亞的氣息。</p>
<p>陰　的天，陰　的河，陰　的工塲的壁壘，和陰　的行人的形影，一切都顯着陰　。滿　着塵灰的廠旁的玻璃窗中，黃黃的電燈光，映照着飛舞不歇的皮革的調帶，連機器的歌聲都顯得那麽的陰　，</p>
<p>但是，偉大的勞動在進行着。機器張舞着鋼　的牙齒，咬嚼黑沉沉的巨條的木塊。從那邊的鐵栅門裏，運出一車一車的潔白的木板，和已經釘上了鐵皮的籍盒。河對岸製氷工塲的高層建築上，密層層的鐵的栅架裏激舞着亮晶晶的水花，一條條的大鋼管通向栅架底下的工房，工房中的熱炎炎的電火下，幢幢着灰黑的人影：爲着富家廚房中的鮮美的菜肴，爲着一曲曼舞後的淸凉的氷淇淋，工人們正在高熱度中迸裂着濁汗，製造那一方一方潔白晶瑩的人造氷。</p>
<p>然而一切的消費與享樂，離開這兒是這樣的遙遠，這兒祗有汚穢的煤烟，汚穢的熱汗；也像消夏别墅的園庭中聽不見這兒機器聲一樣，這兒是聞不到跳舞塲中的爵士音樂的。代替這種狂歡的音樂的，是重濁的工塲的汽笛。</p>
<p>汽笛嗚呌了，愈益昏黑的暮靄中，吐出大堆大堆的男女工人。從朝晨五六點鐘到夕晚六七點鐘，整整十三四小時在九十幾度的炎暑和緊張的機器邊的工作中，顯然地他們的肉體已陷入到極度的疲勞。但他們的精神是不疲勞的，一手提着飯盒，一手携條手巾的靑年女工，三三五五的說着笑着，互相推撞着，蹈着輕快的脚步跑跳。幾個男的故意地鑽進女工隊裏去：　「阿大姐，夜裏到大世界白相去！」</p>
<p>「小鬼頭，你再來鬧，把生活你你吃！」</p>
<p>五六個女工聯合起來向男的圍攻，男的笑着逃跑了。笑聲，駡聲，嘈雜的脚步，陰森的工塲街立刻顯出了晴朗的生氣。這是一種在智識階級所描寫的工人作品中萬不能發見的生氣。</p>
<p>勞動在這個社會中變成了一種苦役，但是這苦役没有把勞動的人們磨拆倒，相反的，他們在痛苦的經歷中，鍜鍊得更益强悍了。你看，那一隊年靑的姑娘，正提起粗健的腿膀面向着那大烟囪後面的太陽，快步的邁向前去了。</p>
<h3>快適的一夜</h3>
<p>— 吳秋山</p>
<p>吳　日的前二日，所以一到黃昏，那將圓的明月，便高懸在樓頭。輕風漸漸把暑氣吹散了，好難得的殘夏的月夜呵！我們不能再静坐在屋裏了！</p>
<p>夜飯之後，和E君一道到外灘銅人碼頭，搭上了八點半鐘的乘凉的夜渡輪，往西渡，慶寗寺，東溝，和高橋等處去兜風。</p>
<p>船上佈置很雅潔，船頭是司機間，接着就是一間小小的Bar裏面放着白蘭地，啤酒，和梳打汽水之類，船梢則用綠竹搭成凉棚，五花十色的電燈，珠絡似的綴在棚的四周，發出柔和的光，棚下是一只一只的帆布椅。我們坐在椅上，喝喝啤酒，抽抽紙烟，說說笑話，聽聽Ｒapio的音樂，凉　當胸，溽暑全消。</p>
<p>船離鬧市漸遠，回頭一望，祗見兩岸燈火，倒影水中，映成一條一條的悠長的金蛇，在蜿蜒地蕩漾着；渡舟，隄樹，望去祗是一片微茫的影子。經過西渡，慶寗寺，接着便是東溝，船在那裏稍停，却少有人上去，只憑欄望見長橋盡處有一簇紅綠的電燈而已。離東溝後，沿着長隄駛去，轉瞬高橋就在眼前了。船停後，走上碼頭，僱了一輛獨輪小車，往静寂的村間走去，在淡月輕烟之下，看見沿路是些菜畦，稻田，板橋，茅舍，眞如電影片中的情影。一會兒，木輪車停在ＣountryHotei前面，下了車，在絨氈似的鬆軟的灰泥路上，走了進去，坐在藤椅上，聽着那在都會所不能聽到的如雨的蟲聲，和遙遥的兩三聲犬吠，眞使人悠然意遠。</p>
<p>可惜開船的時間早經規定，不能久在静野中呼吸一點新鮮空氣。趕回高橋碼頭後，小火輪便又在皓潔的月光下鼓輪回滬，因爲是回來，船行較快，靠銅人碼頭時，海關的大鐘正示著十二點。</p>
<p>雖是怱怱三兩小時的消遣，但在暑天没有機會離開上海的我們，是多麽可珍貴的快適的一夜啊！</p>
<h3>生命與機械（三）</h3>
<p>— 孫泱</p>
<p>望着閃着星子的天空，大夥兒便想到了家：：初春的綠的田野，晚秋的金黃的稻穗，瓜棚的綠葉中垂着的黃色的，綠色的瓜：：：夢一般地在麻木的腦海裡閃過；於是，乾枯的面孔上便點綴起回憶的微笑。然而大夥兒的眉頭又逐漸地皺起來了，現在映在他們眼前的，是一望無際的大水，在浪頭上，陽光正吻着露在水面的樹梢和屋頂；或者是不見一株綠色植物的乾燥的平原，塵土在空氣裡舞蹈，地面裂開了隙縫；不然，便是揑着槍桿子的團防，和收稅的大爺們的各式各樣的冷面孔。閉了眼吧！讓天空隠到黑暗裡，讓回憶葬在睡夢中吧！　閉了眼，就想到了自已的妻和人家的妹妹。身體是瘦倦的，然而血還没有冷呵！有的便唱着十八摸，打牙牌，有的便低聲說着猥　的話。眼裏，全閃着淫慾的火，紅脹的面孔像彈簧一樣地緊張起來了：：：</p>
<p>這就和望着畫上的鹹魚下飯一樣，在渺茫不切實的滿足中，混合着無量的苦痛和辛酸。曣着口沫的時候，性的渴望便和食的渴望擠在一堆。仰面睡的側過身，側着睡的便揉着肚子。睜開眼，兩種希望都和天上的星一般地渺茫。</p>
<p>靠欄杆的較淸潔的地板上，舖着兩張乾凈的草蓆，兩個小工頭模樣的人舒適地躺着，微帶一點驕傲的神氣傾聽着大夥兒的話。</p>
<p>「喂！阿發！」兩個當中突然有一個從草蓆上翻起來，眼晴像醉了酒似的。</p>
<p>「什麽呀？」另外一個腦袋歪在一個小包袱上，懶洋洋地問。</p>
<p>「你還有多少錢？」急切和熱望的聲音。那個人坐起來，把小包袱在手裏顚了顚：「幹什麽？金生」「我問你，你夠嗎？」「還好，」阿發又倒下去。「明後兒還夠上燕子窠。」</p>
<p>「呸！我問你到民國路（註：附近弄堂內多下等妓女）夠嗎？」</p>
<p>「哦！」皺了一下眉頭。「差不多。」「那末去吧！」金生站起來。「明後兒不抽了麽？」</p>

<h3>新花壓抑下之上週美棉</h3>
<p>紐約十八日來電報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉市跌勢頗猛、缘多頭大批了結、及套賣增加、老多頭顯以雜糧市况之一蹶不振、而爲之驚慌、新花良好、上市在卽、致人心惶慮、亦爲跌價之一因也、多數忍痛斬結之、俱未及了淸、更以西部大批賣出、恐係爲其所囤小麥之保護、缘小麥日跌未已、致該貨額一時不能急切在雜糧市塲了結也、其後以空頭抵補較活、小麥又有回穏之象、而通貨膨脹說亦重起、故反動復興、計畫之遷延、由於若干重要工業、一時不能實行之故、棉貨交易有限、人心參差、蓋以原料市面不定、同時須待價格提高後、零星生意方動云、</p>

<h3>糧食薄稻稀少好起角餘</h3>
<p>滬南昨日來源十餘號、零躉兩胃均懈、形勢淸淡、所幸連日貨稀、市尙見緊、惟常帮蘇同帮白粳及杜洋尖因來貨較多、僅鮮特者略提角許、中次者悉無榮辱、其南港厚稻雖乏貨、因胃呆亦定、而薄稻則以靑角帮來源絶踪、且各帮亦復寥落、故包胃一動、數雖二三百包、價卽提升角餘之譜、而售方尙含不願脫手之意、市形頗俏、變元續跌、廠東新站守原盤、</p>
<p>滬北昨日河下各路來源三十五號、市上各貨去胃尙佳、北粳次定、中次緊數分、早薄稻及洋杜尖新客尖東新粳等價見定勢、埠尖挺立、陳客尖價形緊勢、惟變元去胃平淡、價小一角、</p>
<h3>湖南早糙頭批抵申</h3>
<p>「一百包未曾售　」</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈客帮雖有辦胃、然　洋米價高不劃通銷、對於客秈素有好感、奈因新貨乏到、陳貨將斷、亦未能暢辦、湖南老倉米本爲浙路唯一主顧、目下亦無到下、閩帮則歡迎低價新米、故全市只有寗波帮辦湖南機油陳米二百四十七包、價七元、其他均無交易、</p>
<p>湖南今年早稻收穫甚佳、預料晚稻及少數之二三熟均有豐稔期望、因此新榖市價已跌小至一元三四角、卽高貨陳榖亦接近一元半矣、目下該省正謀運銷南北各省、以資爲經濟上活動、但運輸轉輾甚煩、且有產銷稅護照、敎育捐騐費、以及一切類似厘卡之新興捐稅、因此每石機米運　上海、必須增加二元左右、卽出路便捷之產區、亦須加增一元數角、所以產價雖低、迄無大額到市應銷也、</p>
<p>昨日湖南早糙新米、頭批已經到申、共計二百包、成本在五元零、出樣後閩浙兩帮均有問訊、因某種關係尙未售開、至其價格、照市上沽價當在五元二角左右、</p>
<h3>標粉略有廠方套賣</h3>
<p>昨粉市上下午開盤後、各月份又呈養頓不堪、以洋麥報價、果合預測、芝加哥計跌一元六角半、坎拿大跌七角八分外、因此開價後、市氣殊見平軟、入後則因廠方略有套賣、遠期更形虚弱、故各盤中、均步步低落、照目下之實銷情形、前途殊覺悲觀居多、如天津一處、存底達二百餘萬、每日銷數、祗及二萬包左右、較往年不及三分之一、而本埠及長江一帶存底、亦甚可觀、所以如乏大暢銷、甚少希望也、結果本月份較前日小五厘、九月份跌一分、十月份跌一分二厘半、十一十二月份跌一分、一月份跌一分二厘半、</p>
<h3>客户活動進期麥</h3>
<p>現麥見交已暢特高貨續穏</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份微呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌一元六角半、坎拿大跌七角八分外、故開價時、人心略疲、惟目下形勢、雖無可漲之道、但內地行家、及本埠掮客、終以洋麥未到之時、仍思硬擯、故抛户一稀、市遂停頓、迨至下午開盤、各盤交易、頗見興奮、因有外行客户、又見活動、各盤均有買進、故喊價遂步步提高、尤以一月份爲更甚、結果八九月份未動、十月份好一分、十一月份小一分、十二月份不動、一月份較上午收價好五分、現麥市面、見交已暢、特高貨仍見穏挻、中次平平、開五河麥三元八角八分、次七角半、瑶　麥三元八角二分、次八角、宿遷麥三元八角、次七角八分、蘇州麥三元六角半、高郵麥三元六角、丹陽麥三元五角七分、常州麥三元五角七分、次五角四分、六合麥三元五角二分、次四角七分、寶應麥三元四角七分、次四角二分、揚州麥三元四角六分、次四角二分、計九千包、由福新辦去、</p>
<h3>新黃豆漲跌互見</h3>
<p>昨常州牛皮黃、走銷頗暢、廣厦寗波及本街均有問訊、成交千餘包、故來源隨到隨化、市勢續趨漲風、但九江豆反跌四五分、因去路薄懈、統市成交七百包、由本街及寗波帮分派、聞其到存之豆、尙有三千餘包云、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白再降五分荷赤反緊</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以標金無甚上落、趨勢仍疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨呌二十元九角、原盤竟乏受手、以八角半稍有成交、荷赤市勢反緊、高貨ＫＤ嘜呌十六元八角、ＰＫ嘜劃十六元六角七分、中華國華本廠綿白跌五分、頂號爲二十元二角半、一號二十元○○五分、二號十九元八角半、三號十九元六角、四號十九元四角半、太古糖無上落、Ｂ嘜仍爲二十一元四角半、號盤僅潮帮開　出簍莊條靑九十件、價爲十元零五角、</p>
<h3>絲茶浙屬早秋繭將上市</h3>
<p>（臨平秋蠶早帮上簇）臨平一帶、蠶汎最早、高司三堡邇來蠶蟻發育順利、早帮已上簇作繭、繭行預備開秤手續、惟蠶多葉少、葉價奇昻、每担須三元左右、</p>
<p>（人造絲市滙長價疲）外滙緊張、人造絲扯價轉疲、客銷稍起、昨由川漢等帮進德記頭二號飛馬等牌現期貨三十箱、價自一百六十七元二角半至一百六十一元七角半凈盤、較前扯價各跌五角、</p>
<p>（海外絲價續呈堅漲）美政府行將實施通貨膨脹、物價因之激漲、紐約生絲市亦隨之上升、奈絲織商手中存絲頗充、態度仍抱觀望、滬埠去電仍鮮轉滬、市氣沈静、昨市仍祗少有補充缺貨交易、計信孚等進白廠經二十包、黃搖五包、價尙堅定、、</p>
<h3>珍眉貢熙交易俱旺</h3>
<p>昨日婺源屯溪等路之珍眉貢熙綠茶、交易均旺、惟珍眉去路、仍以上中莊爲多、低莊次貨仍呆、貢熙市面、最爲堅挺、俄莊恊助會及白頭行家、鑒於來源稀少、進意益加濃厚、因之隨到隨銷、極少囤積、市盤亦較前堅硬、至針眉珠茶等項、英法行家、需要均殷、惟存底不多、交易頗形淸淡云、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢絨新貨紛至沓來</h3>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>改造中國應效法誰呢？</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>自從歐洲大戰停戰以來的十幾年中，這世界上產生出多少新興的國家。在這些國家中，除了中歐與南歐許多由奥匃聯邦帝國的瓦解而獲得獨立的小國外，其他素以大國著名，因受戰敗的壓迫而奮起圖存，迄今取得一興新國的地位者，有土爾其，德意志；其因大戰影響，致本國政治弱點日益暴露，而由內政的革命，一新世界耳目，取得較高的國際地位者，有蘇維埃，意大利，及中國。我們看這幾個國家，改革內政，外抗强權的手段與方法雖不同，但是要從被壓迫的環境謀得獨立的解放，爭取民族生存的目的，則初無二致。現在土，德，意，俄，在不同的環境下，用不同方法，均取得了他們所要取得的結果，祗有我們這老大的中國，雖曾經民十五·六·七·三年的流血革命，然到現在仍是在這繼續受壓迫的過程中徘徊着，在外交上喪城失地是不必說了，而內政腐敗的情况，參看歷來監察院諸公所宣佈的文件，即可知致少也較以前未有進步。那麽，何以别的國家能從外交壓迫，內政紊亂的環境下，打出一個新局面來，而我們中國就不能呢？這是我們今天要與讀者討論的一個問題。</p>
<p>有人說，這是不能這樣來比較的，因爲中國的歷史，地理以及社會經濟的背景，都在在與其他小國不同，何况就是土，德，意，俄，的背景，也是互有異别的。不過我們對於這個問題，所要注意的關鍵，也並不是要從那廣大複雜不同的背景中去求答案，乃是要從一個共同的原則下去研究中國今後應如何借鏡與效法的途徑。</p>
<p>什麽是土，德，意，俄，四國復興的原則呢？簡而言之？就是大多數人民都有一種謀求國家獨立，造成民族復興的渴望，從這種渴望的情緒下，就能產生出偉大的行動力量來。一個受壓迫的國家，其人民若没有一種謀個人生存的勇氣，求國家獨立平等的熱烈情緒，就决不會產生出偉大的反抗精神與堅强的</p>
<p>行動力量來。戰後的土爾其人是充滿了亡國的危懼，同時亦富有熱烈的救國的情緒，然後始有能力收復失地，擊敗希人，使列强不敢正視。意大利雖是大戰的得勝者，然因生產落後，工業不發達，議會制度的形破產，大多數人民受不了這種破殘情形中的痛苦，結果遂造成墨索里尼氏復興意大利的成功。德國戰後的情形，雖遠較意大利爲惡劣，但是惡劣的環境，却能造成更大的反抗精神與行動的能力，我們看戰後的德人，那種艱苦卓絶的奮鬭成績，就可證明這一個理論的正確了。再看戰後新俄的大改革，益發使我們了解反抗精神與行動能力之所由來矣！論到舊俄內政的腐敗，敎育的不發達，均較中國有過之而無不及，至於工業生產的落後，則更不足與德意相比擬，於是大戰後，俄國制度的破壞與成功，也就遠較土，德，意，三國爲激烈而澈底了！</p>
<p>我們若是要問中國的前途應效法誰呢？我們祗要估量一下我們大多數國人的救自已的勇氣與求國家獨立的情緒如何？倘若是有這種勇氣與情緒，那麽是無論效法誰，都可以成功。若是没有或是很弱，那就惟不聽人宰割了。</p>

<p>國藥舖裏的櫃員ＩＩ尤其是飲片部裏的櫃員，自上午七時半起，至下午九時止，整日在工作着。假若店裏生意淡一點還好，不然的話，那準得一天到晚在店堂裏做跑馬戲，團團轉的，按方撮藥。所以，一般飲片部裏的櫃友，在整日勞力勞神之下，一到晚上，便感覺非</p>
<p>常的疲憊，需要休息。</p>
<p>但老周却不然，他每和人家講：「　工作愈忙碌愈好，我愈高興！」因此，同事們都稱他做老怪物，没知覺的人。但是，我相信老周的話，不是矯詐之言，確是由衷之談。他那兩句簡單的話中，含有無限的悲哀意味；年靑的同事們，怎能領會到呢！</p>
<p>老周的意思，覺得工作愈忙碌，愈能忘却一切足以使他煩惱的事件。</p>
<p>闔上了大門，工作停止了，在老周看起來，覺得這時間是最懊惱最若痛不過的辰光。他會想起種種問題：「五百元待還的借欵；大兒子流落在異鄉，自已是五十多歲的人了，月薪祗十六元。：：：：：」凡此種種問題，一經憶起，便盤旋在腦際不走了。他嘆息！他流淚！每夜在十時以後纔能上床睡覺。</p>
<p>昨天下午，一連接到三封要錢的信，老周的心裏，已苦到不堪言狀，那知道今天晚上他姪子阿福又來索債了，一開口便說：「一百三十二元八角，請老伯在年底還我半數吧！」他好客易忙裏偷閒，避着經理的耳目，把阿福打發走開。他承認在年內償還四分之一。</p>

<p>經理先生坐着包車回公館去了，同事們也都笑嘻嘻的睡覺去了，霎時間，店堂裏只賸他一個人影。他一如往常那樣的，一個人端了一杯茶，走到晝間醫生診病的所在坐下，一面啜茶，一面思索。</p>
<p>他覺得右腿上剌剌的痛，蹺起來一看，很腫。再蹺起左足一看，也一樣的腫，一樣的痛。這顯然是因爲工作過度，整天走動所得的結果。同時，在襪子統上發現兩個破洞。</p>
<p>待到他上床睡覺，已是將近十一點鐘了，在十二點鐘後，方完全入夢。　他恍惚覺得債務都已還淸，兒子做了事，他已安閒地在家裏享着暮年之樂了。但是，這快樂的情境，爲學徒急迫的呼喚聲所破壞。他醒了，他還是欠着五百元債的老周！將爲十六元月薪工作的老周！學徒告訴他已是七點半鐘，經理先生快要到了。</p>
<p>於是，他急忙披衣，怱怱下床，忘却了一切苦痛，收藏起一切悲哀，去工作了。</p>

<h3>業餘咖啡屋大衆頭上撈一把</h3>
<p>— 田蕾女士</p>
<p>香烟公司的老板，說吸烟可以致富，空壳十只，換劵一張，有得奬萬元的希望。銀行經理辦了「有奬儲蓄」，三十元存進，有得奬三十二次的機會，有成爲大資本家的可能。此外又有什麽「航空奬劵」，十元一張，有頭奬五十萬元，小奬五千餘個的希望（據說爲求普遍發行起見，現已改爲一元一條，這更可福利平民不少！）。這許多奬金，都是十足發給，硬上加硬的，只要你窮小子有點來歷，或某根骨頭長得得法，或是八字生得好點，說不定會立刻坐起汽車，發起財來。瞧！「航空奬劵」的得主，不是早就把五十萬領去了嗎？烟草公司奬劵的得主，這兩天不還在報上登着玉照嗎？大家都有出路了！趕快吃香烟，加入「有奬儲蓄」，買「航空奬劵」吧！</p>
<p>然而，我心裏終究免不了有些疑惑。得奬的人畢竟是少數，即使得了奬，這奬金也是從大衆身上掠奪去了的，而大多數的人仍然是在失望的路上徘徊着，也或許竟因失望而發生病態、（據報載：有數人因航空奬劵未中，而至奬券辦事處，大發祥經痛）。我總覺得這「有奬事業」就和抽頭聚賭差不多。賭这各的輸嬴，莊家可不關，橫豎頭錢總可穏穏地到手，就是你們輸光了去投黃浦，也是「白死」，反正嬴錢的和莊家，早就把洋錢送進自已的荷包裏了！</p>
<p>有「有奬事業」的盛行，則「賣血汗」，「絞腦汁」的朋友們辛苦得來的錢，又要被老板，經理，大人先生們一篐腦兒榨一榨了。我對「有奬事業」無以名之，名之曰：「大衆頭上撈一把！」</p>
<p>業餘運動</p>
<h3>改良的舉重物</h3>
<p>— 程希遠</p>
<p>舉重運動（ＨoabyLiftEcercise）爲發達人體肌肉最有效的方法。舉重物，像我國稱爲石鼓子（即仙人担亦名石担）的就是。</p>
<p>因爲缺少肌肉的缘故，人體就肥瘦不均，康健的「體格美一亦就此而消失工。欲使肌肉發達，惟行强力運動爲最見效。舉重，就是强力運動的一種，可以改善身體過肥與過瘦的幣病，而變爲肥瘦適中强壯有力的軀幹。</p>
<p>但舉重物有何改良的必要？難道牠還有什麽不合理不完全的地方嗎？不！我這裏所謂「改良」的，並非對於一切舉重物的本質而說，乃是另外想出一種新的方法來，以適應一般因舉重運動而發生地位上或是經濟上的種種困難的人的需要　不過這新的方法還是依照了舊的舉重物的原理而加以一番「改良」罷了。　這「改良的舉重物」　造極其簡單。請看圖一：</p>
<h3>說明</h3>
<p>Ａ　粗繩（吊在天花</p>
<p>板或壁上的鈎子</p>
<p>上。中間距離約</p>
<p>三尺。）</p>
<p>Ｂ　竹槓或木棍（長</p>
<p>約四尺左右，套</p>
<p>（圖一）在Ａ繩裏，高低</p>
<p>與胸相齊。）</p>
<p>Ｃ　重物（布袋兩隻</p>
<p>，內各盛沙泥或</p>
<p>石塊或舊書報紙</p>
<p>，凡重量的東西</p>
<p>都可以，掛在竹</p>
<p>槓或木棍的兩端</p>
<p>。輕重可隨各人</p>
<p>的體力而加减之。）</p>
<h3>用法</h3>
<p>運動時先立正，將兩手托住（不是大姆指伸出握住）竹槓或木棍；然後徐徐向</p>
<p>上舉起（舉時腿膝不能灣屈），再徐徐放下，如圖二與圖三：</p>
<p>這樣一上一下的運動着，至舉不動時爲止（切勿拚命硬撑），就休息休息，然後再舉；不多時兩臂就澎漲了。若能每天練習而不間斷，不荒廢，不久臂力漸漸增加，肌肉自然而然的會發達起來</p>
<p>。</p>
<h3>注意</h3>
<p>（一）舉重前宜行深呼吸，散步或跳繩。</p>
<p>（二）飽食後勿舉重。</p>
<p>（三）舉重後因體熱的增加而出汗時，勿立在當風之處。</p>
<p>（四）勿運動過度，最好每天規定一時間舉重幾次。</p>
<p>這「改良的舉重物」，如其覺得裝在室內是「有碍觀瞻」的話，那不要緊！不消一分鐘就可以把牠Ｉ繩，竹槓（或木棍）及重物一起都拆下來；要練習時亦立刻可以裝上去；手續非常簡便，迅速</p>
<p>，並没有討厭，麻煩及不方便之處，不信，去試試看吧！</p>

<p>弱小民族呼聲小專号下</p>
<h3>地球上的飄流者</h3>
<p>— 魯海</p>
<p>洋海員華海員</p>
<p>海員，在輪船上，除了搭客以外，所有一切的人都統稱爲海員，但因其內部經</p>
<p>濟階級地位殊異的關係，故又可分爲上等海員與下等海員二種：上等者，即統治全船政權的船長，伙長，機師，工頭：：等的少數人；下等者，即佔全船最大多數的水手，火夫，侍仔：等。然而我們大中華民國人大部分或全部都是下等海員，而那些上等海員老是讓給外國人去當的。有時我們稱他們爲貴族職員，而不稱作海員。我這兒所說的是一般的下等海員生活：</p>
<p>當海員的手續是，首先要去認識「涉孖沙」（即包工制頭目），然後再去巴結一下，送他一點禮物（最好是洋錢），請求他留意一點工作的位置。他（涉孖沙）領受到你的禮物以後，眞是靈騐得很，一個禮拜以內，包你得去大河船（即航行外國的，如藍烟通，吉連船，皇后船：：等）而你的工作位置就可有解决了。</p>
<p>當你由「涉孖沙」介紹到某船公司的船裏工作，走大河，訂明六個月合同（即一水船）即由船公司發給一本「派士砵」（證書）。每月工資爲二十三圓。在船開行之前，須先出兩個月「灣士」（上期工資）。完全由「涉孖沙」領去，作爲介紹工作的酬勞費。</p>
<p>到了船，起碼要嘗六個月的波濤流浪人的生涯，然而家中要靠着你的維持的父母妻兒的生活費又怎樣辦呢？兩個月的「灣士」已給「涉孖沙」作酬勞去了，而手上又無一文。但那時你用不着憂心，「涉孖沙」自然要爲你發點「慈悲」，替你解决困難的。於是他就打着笑臉同你說：『你要錢把回家做使用嗎？』『哪，借給你三十圓，個大個小，錦上添花。』（「個大個小」即借一圓，月息一角，「錦上添花」即利上加利），到了那個時候，你即使不要借也不能不借呀！</p>
<p>向「涉孖沙」借過三十圓以後，即把一部分放在家裏作米飯，餘下來的要買些熟烟和平安藥到船上來，預防頭痛身熱。</p>
<p>於是，海員生活開始了，「今日此兮，明日彼方」的地球上流浪生涯開始了。</p>
<p>每日，天還未發亮，就要起床。吃過那所謂早飯（其實是稀飯粥），即提着粗大的帆布水管去洗甲板，磨艙面，擦銅，油漆，打整錨鍊，上檣桅頂去拆羅絲：：：假如慢了一些，一隻洋火腿即送到你的屁股來。「那把温」的綠眼睛就釘在你的身上而破口大駡。你簡直不能偷點懶的，就是吃口熟烟也遭妬忌的。在甲板上，整個上午一點也不能停。　午飯是在十二時半開始。像喂猪一般，八個人一棹，蹲在艙的甲板上圍着。菜肴多半是白菜炒白菜，有點異味的猪肉煨湯，兩塊咸腐亂之類。假如你要說點關於伙食不好的話，「涉孖沙」的偵探，頭目的親信人，就給你一個巴掌，兩記耳光，甚至於要把你停工。</p>
<p>下午，仍然回到甲板上層去工作，有時還要鬆舢板，漆船傍。假使你偶一「不愼」跌下「鹹田」去，那可無人負責任，只不過中華民國少了一個人就是了。　晚上，猪欄似的「福士龍」（船前房）架起了三十二舖的吊床，足夠睡三十二夥計。一盞五枝燭光的電燈。爲了空氣侷促的缘故，房裏燻出陣陣的異味來，嗅之要使人作嘔。</p>
<p>吃過了晚飯，六時半了，一天的工作結束了，生財有大道的「那把温」（工頭）則舉行其生財的晚會，開了五六盞燈（鴉片烟燈），每圓四分的「上白」，（鴉片名），每元二分的」沉油」（鴉片名），再擺上三四張檯的番灘，牌九，麻雀，鬭牛：：等。「那把温」更親自出馬廣招「有興趣者來」。鴉片可以賒賬，賭錢也可以欠數，假如你連烟賭都不參加，那麽你下水船不要再希望在船做了。</p>
<p>這樣，六個月一水船都是這樣。迨船返唐山（即回到中國）大家便都到「些拉咸」（東方水手公會）領工錢，總計可得九十二圓。除了還五十四圓給「涉孖沙」的借欵和利息外，再還十五六元給船上的工頭，總計尙存二十三四圓。但是，當船尙未進港的時候，妻子，父母已在碼頭上等候你「順景」的回來了，好把幾個月來的欠債淸還哩！</p>
<h3>國際合作</h3>
<p>— 逸中</p>
<p>洋員中國小職員</p>
<p>某大機關在中國實業界中佔有很重要的地位，自從去年經過一番改革以後，曾剔除了許多積弊，把業務改進了一些，但這裏却有一件事是我們所不解的：</p>
<p>記得去年爲了緊縮　見中該機關裁了大批的職員，Ｘ棧裁去了五六十人。這許多人都曾在該機關服務了幾十年或幾年之久的，照章裁去了應給退職金若干。起先該機關當局不肯發給，後來經他們請了許多次的願，苦求哀憐，總算拿到一個月的退職金，但爲了要求這退職金，大家已經空等了兩個多月，一個月的退職金還不夠兩個月空等的開支。結果，每個人埀頭喪氣的走了。</p>
<p>今年有三個外國人，洋員，都要退職了（該機關當局是不敢辭掉他們的），他們每個人得了兩萬塊錢的路費，三萬塊錢的退職金，三個人一共支了十五萬。去年幾十個請願的中國小職員，幾年的薪金也合不到十五萬，但爲了要給洋員大人飽飽的袋了去，也就顧不得幾十個中國小人要失業和幾百個人要餓肚子的事了。這裏最奇怪的是，三個洋人中的一個，領了五萬塊錢，却並没有動身，還是照常供職，每月領幾千兩銀子的薪水。</p>
<p>還有，該機關除掉裁去了許多小職員，增加了一些大職員外，又將小職員的年例雙薪和年例加薪統統取消，小職員是受着「特惠」了，弄得大家都呌苦連天。好像中國人應該吃苦，都是飯桶，應該裁去，一定要請洋大人來纔能稱職，所以每科請了一個洋大人，薪金二千四百兩一月，還要住洋房。名義上說是爲的要改革業務，以三個月爲期，但到現在已有六個月而業務還是如此，一些也不曾改革，還是由幾個中國小職員在那裏努力工作，一點也不曾變換什麽，也不曾見洋大人有什麽指導和供獻。另一方面，該機關招來了一批練習生，在練習期間每人只有二十元的津貼，不供膳宿。練習期原定爲三個月，但到現在已有五個月，還不見一點動静。有兩個不識相的人去探問探問，除了碰一個釘子以外，過不了幾天，該機關　局就對他們說：『現在，你們練習期已滿，本局没處安插，請另謀高就吧！</p>
<p>小小專著</p>
<h3>意外險</h3>
<p>— 高士其</p>
<p>洋車夫拚着兩脚的能力在馬路上拉着車子跑，前面忽然來了一輛開得很快的汽車，他一時太慌張了，急忙迴避，致和旁邊的車輛或行人相撞而使車翻人覆：泥水匠立在屋頂的沿邊上修理牆瓦或小工站在高樓的窗沿上擦玻璃，一不小心，失足跌下；工廠中的工人常爲機械所碰擊；救火夫鐵匠等常爲火所燒傷；他如火車，汽車及電車等出險之事，時有所聞：諸如此類的危險，都是出乎意外的，而從這些危險所得來的傷痛，就統稱爲意外險。</p>
<p>我們中國對於工人的衛生向不注意，工人的疾病旣無登記，意外險的統計更無從核算。雖然工人的人數要佔全國人口的很大部份，這一部份人民平日的生活已極窮苦，而其所遭遇的意外險當亦不可勝計。熱心公共衛生的人們，對於意外險的防範，尙盼竭力加以注意。</p>
<p>意外險的主要原因，一部份是因爲環境的危險，一部份是因爲自已神經的不靈敏，以致遭遇最大的不幸。茲舉其大綱如次：</p>
<p>甲、環境的危險：（一）火險，一切被火燒傷的危險，如救火夫，鐵匠等所處的環境；（二）水險，淹溺的危險，如漁夫，船户等所處的環境；（三）電險，觸電的危險，如電匠等的環境；（四）車險，一切車類所發生的危險，如汽車電車，火車等伕役的環境；（五）機險管理及運用機器時的危險；（六）跌險，如建築及修理房屋時的危險；（七）礦險，在礦中作工時種種的危險；（八）畜險，飼養牲畜野獸時的危險；（九）貨險，搬運重貨時的危險；（十）藥險，如火藥及化學藥品製造廠中的危險。</p>
<p>乙、神經的不靈敏：（一）疾病，有病者精神多半不健：（二）疲倦；（三）酒醉；（四）視力不佳；（五０聽力不佳；（六）不識字，不識字的人，對於危險的警告，多不知注意；（七）粗心；（八）工作不敵合，若工人的能力不適宜於所操的工作，則危險之事必較易發生；（九）過於怱忙，以前有人核計過，工廠中所發生的意外險，有極多數是在上午十時至下午三時中間，這是因爲在這時間內工作過於怱忙的缘故；</p>
<p>（十）童工，童工較成年的工人容易得意外險。</p>
<p>意外險是工人的大不幸，但是可以預防。我們旣已知道牠的種種原因，就可以想出種種方法去制止或避免牠。我們一方面要改造環境的情形，以减少其危險，一方面要指導工人使其小心而免自蹈危險。茲舉預防意外險的方法如次　（一）責任心Ｉ僱主或廠主處處須有保護工人的責任心　（二）工人敎育Ｉ僱主對於工人須施以自衛的敎育；　（三）法律Ｉ政府對於工人的保護須訂有專律；　（四）警告Ｉ凡有危險的地方須揭示明顯的警告或標語；　（五）保險設備Ｉ危險的地方須設有保險的機關，如機器的保險欄等；　（六）心理衛生Ｉ用心理測騐方法，以斷定工人與其工作的分配是否適當；　（七）時間Ｉ减少工作的時間，使工人不至過於疲倦；　（八）工資Ｉ增加工資，使工人的生活較爲優裕，而對於工作的精神亦能增進；</p>
<p>（九）研究Ｉ根據事實的考察，研究工作的情形，力謀改善；　　（十）工人恤金Ｉ工人不幸而遭受意外險者，應享有恤金的權利，其恤金的多寡，視受傷的輕重及家庭的情形而定。</p>

<h3>Yellow River Water Level Eases</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Can Be Secured Without Worry</p>
<p>The Former Course Water Enters Weishan Lake from the Dasha River</p>
<p>The Breaches in Fengxian and Peixian Counties Are Still Being Blocked</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A special commissioner dispatched by the Commissioner's Office to Gaozhai to survey the water returned to Xuzhou and said that the water depth in the former river course there is more than ten feet, and the width is five *li*. At the place where it enters the Sha River, there is a nine-arched long bridge, four arches of which have been washed away. The water flowing north is extremely rapid. Downstream of the former course from the east, there is a large dam six or seven *li* long across the river, preventing the Yellow River water from flowing eastward. The Xiaoxian County government has dispatched mounted police to cooperate with the people to guard it and has stored materials to prepare for emergency repairs, and the defenses are extremely tight. Xuzhou can be kept safe. On the 19th, the fourth district of Tongshan reported that the backflow water from Fengxian and Peixian had flooded to Shichengzhai in the district, with a water level of about one foot and a width of three or four *li*. The district residents are currently building defenses. It is found that the fourth district is located in the northwest of Tongshan, adjacent to Fengxian and Peixian, and is also affected by the flood. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Hu Zhaolin, the county magistrate of Peixian, and Yang Liang, the county magistrate of Fengxian, both sent telegrams to Xuzhou reporting that the Sha River water level is still more than ten feet high and has entered Weishan Lake. Today there is heavy rain, and the dikes in Peixian have been damaged in many places and are being urgently defended. Fengxian is blocking the Fengji water inlet. If this inlet is blocked, Fengxian can be kept safe without worry. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level of the Yellow River in its former course has dropped, and the upstream source has decreased. Xubu can be kept safe without worry. The water diverted from Gaozhai Panlongji north into the Sha River has already flowed into Weishan Lake. The situation in Fengxian and Peixian has also eased. However, Weishan Lake has a lot of water, and it is bound to flow further into the Central Canal. Pizhou, Suyu, and Suqian should urgently take precautions. The flood in northern Jiangsu is expected not to expand. Yu Nianci has now specially dispatched Tian Guangbi to Caozhou to investigate the water situation at the upper source. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to road news, the water from the Dasha River had reached Weishan Lake by the morning of the 19th. The situation in Peixian and Fengxian is gradually easing, but dikes are collapsing from time to time due to heavy rain. The people of the two counties are still engaged in emergency repairs. It is found that the rainfall in the Xuzhou area is very heavy today, which may help increase the water level. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Zeng Wanzhong, due to the eastward flood of the Yellow River, dispatched Zhang Xuewen, deputy brigade commander of the 19th Brigade of the 7th Division, to Dangshan to inspect and supervise the troops stationed in Dangshan to repair the dikes. Zhang returned to Qi yesterday and reported that the Yellow River water flow has slowed down and dropped by two feet, and the dikes are very solid. If there are no other changes upstream, Dangshan can be kept safe without worry. Zeng ordered the troops stationed in Dangshan to report the water level by telegram three times a day. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water situation in Fengxian and Peixian was still urgent on the morning of the 19th. The Baimiao inlet in eastern Fengxian has been blocked. The Fengji water situation, 20 *li* from the city, is the most dangerous and is being urgently blocked. The Peixian water flows north into Zhaoyang Lake. The water situation west of Peixian is extremely severe, and the urban area is still in danger. On the morning of the 19th, there was a rainstorm in Xubu, and there was also heavy rainfall in various parts of Xuzhou Prefecture, which will help increase the Yellow River's flow.</p>
<p>(19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A telephone report from Suqian at noon on the 19th said that there was heavy rain in the county and the canal water had risen sharply. In the low-lying areas along the coast, the water depth was several feet. Fortunately, the original water level of the canal was very low. Now that Weishan Lake is receiving the Yellow River flood, the canal water has also increased sharply, and the situation feels serious. The people on both sides of the river are very panicked. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The county magistrate of Fanxian sent an urgent telegram reporting that the Yellow River north bank had breached. The water level in the county continued to rise by 2 *cun*. South of the Jin Dike, the water is about 40 *li* wide, and the water depth in the flat ground is 2 meters. More than 2,000 laborers were mobilized for defense. All the villages and houses have collapsed, and the sounds of mourning can be heard everywhere. It is unbearable to hear. Please quickly allocate funds for relief. The water level of the county's large dike is only 5 *cun* from overflowing. The River Bureau, because the Jin Dike on the north bank has not seen water for a long time, issued a notice to Puyang, Fanxian, Shouzhang, Yanggu, and Dong'a counties to quickly mobilize laborers to build additional levees. In addition, the water from the breach on the south bank reached Juye city yesterday, with a width of six or seven *li* and a depth of 5 *cun*. The county is diverting the water into the Shu River to avoid expanding the disaster. Heze is organizing a general relief association. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The fellow villagers from western Shandong in Jinan held a meeting today, with 70 or 80 people attending, to form a Western Shandong counties Yellow River flood disaster emergency meeting. A resolution was passed to send representatives to appeal to the Central Government and the provincial government, and to request exemption from corvée and grain tax. (18th Dispatch)</p>

In addition, a telegram was received from Jiangsu Chairman Gu Zhutong stating that if the breach on the south bank is not quickly blocked, it will inevitably flow into the Huai River and then into the Yangtze River.

The situation is extremely urgent and joint efforts should be made to advance, etc. The Yellow River Conservancy Association has now decided to convene a six-province flood prevention conference in Nanjing in the near future. Wang Yingyu, the vice chairman of the association, will immediately go to western Shandong for inspection and meet with Han in Jinan to jointly plan everything. (19th Dispatch)</p>

Furthermore, the association stated that the dike of the former Yellow River course and the Xing dike of Changyuan will be breached, which will encroach on the borders of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces and directly threaten the dikes along the Central Canal and inland canals.

<h3>The Takeover of Yuguan Is Stalled, and Liu Shirun Returns to Beiping to Report</h3>
<p>The Japanese Use the Excuse That Hishikari Has Not Yet Assumed Office. About 500 Japanese Soldiers Are Still Stationed in the Luandong Area. (Beiping) The Yuguan takeover has been delayed due to the death of the Commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Muto, and the reshuffling of Japanese personnel. The Japanese Army Yuguan Command originally planned to move to Qiansuo in the middle of this month. Now, because the newly appointed Commander of the Kwantung Army, Hishikari, has not yet assumed office, the Japanese Army is using the excuse that they have not received orders from the new commander and will not move. At the same time, Chief of Staff Iso, who was previously responsible for negotiations in Yuguan, has returned to Japan, and Brigade Commander Hattori also left Yuguan on the 15th and went west. Another Japanese army commander will be sent to Yuguan to take over responsibility, which will have a slight impact on the negotiations. A definite reply must wait until Hishikari arrives in Changchun. Hishikari has left Kobe to take office and is expected to receive a reply from Hishikari around the 25th of this month before negotiations can resume. There can be no progress before this period. The takeover of various agencies in the city will also wait until after Hishikari's reply. However, transportation has fully recovered. The Railway Bureau is still occupied by the Japanese Army Command, which has agreed to vacate two rooms within days for the Railway Bureau to work in. The Customs has resumed operations. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Yuguan states that the Japanese have agreed to our takeover of the telegraph and postal bureaus. The Special Commissioner Liu Shirun, who was in charge of the war zone, returned to Beiping from Yuguan last night and visited He this afternoon to report on the progress of the negotiations. This matter needs to be decided after Huang returns to Beiping. Huang will return before the 25th. Liu decided to wait in Beiping and return to Yuguan after discussing the matter in detail with Huang. There are currently more than 500 Japanese soldiers stationed in Luandong, some of whom are from the Kwantung Army and some from the Tianjin Garrison Army. The Kwantung Army can withdraw with the Command in the future. According to the Boxer Protocol, this year is Japan's year to be responsible for maintaining the security of the Beining Railway, so they are using the excuse that they will not withdraw for the time being. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Shirun said that there is still a part of the Japanese Army's 14th Brigade under Hattori, about 200 people, in Linyu city. Most of the brigade had been ordered to be transferred outside the Pass a long time ago. Brigade Commander Hattori recently received orders from his country to transfer to Osaka and serve in the 4th Division. Ping Tian has replaced Hattori as the commander of the 14th Brigade. After our takeover of Linyu County, the office location will still be in Haiyang Town. Shi Yousan's troops have completed their reorganization and are now stationed in Yutian. The takeover of the counties in the war zone has been largely completed. The task of the takeover commissioners may be completed by the end of this month. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Shirun recently went to Yuguan to negotiate with the Japanese authorities regarding the takeover of the area. He returned to Beiping this morning without any results. Liu said that the Japanese are currently unwilling to return the city because Muto is dead and Hishikari Takashi has not yet taken office, so there is no one in charge in Changchun. He also said that the Japanese plan to set up a telegraph bureau in Yuguan, which they will maintain even after returning the city. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Special Commissioner Liu Shirun arrived in Beiping from Yuguan on the morning of the 19th and visited He Yingqin in the afternoon to report on the negotiations with the Japanese. According to Liu, the Japanese have several requests to us: (1) When goods from outside the Pass are transported into the Pass and pass through Yuguan, our side should not levy taxes and must handle them at Qin Island. (2) The Japanese plan to transport grain along the Luan River to Rehe and request permission to use this line. (3) The Japanese plan to establish a telegraph bureau in Yuguan to facilitate communication. Our side has not responded to the above three items and will decide after Hishikari takes office and Chairman Huang returns to Beiping. As for the Japanese troops stationed along the stations from Tangshan to Luanzhou, due to the Boxer Protocol, this term is also Japan's term, so they cannot withdraw.

<h3>The Method for Reorganizing the Irregular Troops in Chahar Province Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>Irregular Troops Will Be Reorganized According to the Principle of Pacification and Provisional Food Expenses Will Be Issued. The Leaders of the Irregular Troops Will Be Given the Title of Military Councilor. Feng Zhian Led His Headquarters to Zhangjiakou Yesterday. Song Zheyuan and Qin Decun Will Depart Today. (Beiping) Song Zheyuan discussed the aftermath of Chahar with various important people day by day and decided: (1) After Song returns to Zhangjiakou, he will invite the leaders of the irregular troops and reorganize the irregular troops separately according to the principle of pacification. (2) As for the placement of the leaders of the irregular troops, each will be given the title of Military Council of the Military Advisory Council and ordered to leave the troops. Fang Zhenwu was telegraphed again and invited to come to Beiping to serve as a member of the Military Sub-Committee. Sun Liangcheng will serve as a councilor of the Military Advisory Council. Zhang Yunrong will serve as a staff member of the Military Commission. (3) The Central Government has agreed to instruct the Ministry of Finance to allocate 2 million yuan for the North China Relief Fund for August to Chahar Province. As Chahar Province urgently needs funds, it has been decided to transfer a part of the relief fund for the aftermath and reorganization expenses in Chahar Province. The Military Sub-Committee has dispatched three senior staff officers, Tu Sizong, Lei [blank], and Hou Yao, to reside in Zhangjiakou to handle everything. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhian led the special service regiment of his headquarters to Zhangjiakou this afternoon. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan told reporters that he would go to Chahar tomorrow. He had largely agreed with He Yingqin on the military and political aftermath of Chahar and had reported it to the Central Government by telegram. As for the handling of Ji's troops, after he returns to Zhangjiakou, he plans to invite Ji himself or send representatives to Zhangjiakou for a face-to-face meeting to avoid suspicion. Ji's troops actually only have 1,000 to 2,000 people. Their organization is divided into two types: conscripts and volunteers. In the future, a way will be found to organize them separately. The troops in Chahar Province are huge and complex, and the reorganization requires a lot of expenses. The revenue of Chahar Province is only enough for administrative expenses, and the deficit is subsidized by the Central Government. The Central Government has agreed to provide appropriate assistance with all North China military expenses from August. However, before the various irregular troops in Chahar Province are fully reorganized, they will be temporarily provided with food expenses. The amount will be determined after he returns to Chahar and conducts a thorough investigation. He has obtained He's approval for this method. Jiang Bocheng was originally scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou tomorrow to assist in handling everything. However, due to the recurrence of Jiang's hand illness, he plans to seek medical treatment and will stay in Beiping for a day or two before going. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song Zheyuan visited He Yingqin last night, he finalized the measures for the aftermath of Chahar. Tomorrow afternoon, he will return to the province with Qin Decun and two or three senior staff officers of the Military Sub-Committee to resume his duties. Song said that regarding the situation in Duolun, Li Shouxin is a local native, and his troops are all local militias and bandits gathered together. Their strength can only occupy Duolun and cannot advance any further. (19th Dispatch)</p>

Regarding national affairs, I will always maintain peace in order to safeguard the national vein. I am ordered to come to the capital to participate in the central government's major plans. I am self-aware of my mediocrity and cannot help the current difficulties. However, to the best of my humble knowledge, I will sincerely contribute to save the precarious situation. My troops are moving to the Zhangbei area one after another. After the arrangements for the various troops are completed, I will pay my respects to listen to your instructions. Before departing, I will report again. Respectfully reply." (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Antiquities Case Is Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Zhang Ji Makes a Statement in Beiping (Nanjing) The chief prosecutor of the local court said that due to the unclear address of the party involved, Yi Peiji, in the Yi Peiji antiquities case, repeated summonses have not been delivered, and progress has not been made for the time being. However, the court cannot delay the case due to the inability to summon the party. In addition to transferring the case to the courts in Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin for further investigation and summons, the case will be transferred to the court after collecting sufficient and conclusive evidence. (19th Dispatch)</p>

Although more than 900,000 yuan is deposited in the Palace Museum fund account, Yi Peiji has already spent 70,000 yuan. The money was originally intended for the development of the Palace Museum, but Yi arbitrarily misappropriated it, which is very wrong. He considers it a great shame and humiliation and a sign of national doom that Chinese antiquities are stored in the Shanghai concession and rely on foreign protection. Luo Wengan's tour of Xinjiang pays attention to diplomacy, which is also very important for the development of the Northwest. He hopes that the people will have the power of self-defense due to the rampant bandits in various places. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Lampson Promoted to High Commissioner to Egypt</h3>

Reuters has learned that Sir Miles Lampson is not expected to leave China before November, and his new term will be before the end of the year.

<h3>Judicial Yuan Interprets the Qualifications of Military, Naval, and Air Force Offices</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Public Servants Disciplinary Committee requested an interpretation of whether the existing military and naval departments of the Military Affairs Commission are the military, naval, and air force offices referred to in the Military, Naval, and Air Force Criminal Law.

<h3>The Control Yuan Proposes Impeachment According to Law Regarding the Zhejiang Treasury Bond Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Someone inquired about the Zhejiang Treasury Bond issue with Peng Xuepei, the Director of Administrative Affairs of the Executive Yuan. Peng said that the use of the Zhejiang Treasury Bonds was not improper, but the government had not approved it beforehand, and the legislative procedures were not complete. However, the Central Political Conference has resolved to grant retroactive approval. As for the handling of illegal acts, the matter is now being separately considered by this Yuan. It is heard that the Control Yuan, due to its duties, has automatically proposed impeachment according to law as a warning for the future.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Clarification for Advocates of Women's Rights</h3>
<p>Qu Fangpu, the Director of Finance of Guangdong, issued a notice admonishing the female employees under his jurisdiction for their excessive pursuit of ostentation and lack of decorum. The notice stated, "...they adorn themselves with permed hair, dyed nails, powder and rouge. They wear green and red clothing, competing in extravagance and novelty. This degrades their character and lacks dignity and must be corrected to reverse the declining habits..." Although this matter is small, it is actually significant to the movement for women's rights. I dare to elaborate on it. From a certain perspective, the women's rights movement in our country in recent years has seen considerable progress. The law has endowed the principle of equality, and society has permitted the equal distribution of professions. In general social settings, men are particularly eager to serve women, showing their subtle and humble feelings. The respect for women even surpasses that of Europe and America. The concept of male superiority and female inferiority, which has accumulated in our country for thousands of years, has been shattered. The stifled vitality of women has bloomed fully like buds after rain. Belonging to the same round-headed and square-toed species, there is inherently no distinction between superior and inferior. We can only express our enthusiasm and sympathy for this flourishing women's rights movement and have no intention of discrimination. However, from another perspective, women are generally more prone to emotional impulses and lack rational regulation. Because they lack reason, they cannot always distinguish between right and wrong, and because they are full of emotion, they cannot always decide on the immediate advantages and disadvantages. In this transitional era of disorder, there are no clear rules for people's actions, and they often fall into the habit of decadence and dissipation. Women are inexperienced and easily moved by admiration. Cunning people make small tricks and can easily sell their deception. The benevolent are worried about the fact that good-sounding names are used as tools for evil. I believe that in today's women's rights movement, there are two conditions that must be noted. Regarding women themselves, they should absolutely break away from the cage policy of men in order to earn free and independent personalities. Regarding men, they should completely eliminate narrow and selfish psychology in order to engage in the cultivation of justice and human rights. Otherwise, it is intended to humiliate by men and to sink by women, and both are insufficient to discuss the women's rights movement. Now, let me ask, in the past thousands of years, although women's rights in our country have often been under restriction and oppression, has there never been a time of expansion? Has not the woman with rich black hair and full appearance never been worshiped and bowed down to by thousands of men? However, what is insufficient to praise is that they lack a free personality and only look to the noses of men. They have tried to use the ingenuity of ostentation to absorb wealth, and they have also tried to use the means of anesthesia to seize power. They have also formed temporary favorites and can arbitrarily do whatever they want. In short, is it not exchanging the soul for the enjoyment of the moment? Is the so-called "power" not completely built on the will of men? Isn't the worship and bowing down of many people equal to a disguised plaything? This is why there has been no women's rights in our country for the past thousands of years.</p>
<p>Today, women who are engaged in professional circles are actually the pioneers of the women's rights movement. The mission they bear is great, and the responsibilities they should fulfill are even more important. If these people can know how to purify themselves, then women's occupations will become more prosperous, and the women's rights movement can gradually enter a smooth path. Otherwise, once public opinion arises and people harbor doubts, the women's rights movement will be hit hard and will not be able to move forward. There are two ways to purify oneself. First, strive to improve one's skills. Second, cultivate the habit of frugality. With sufficient skills, there will be no more accusations of being a "vase" in countering men. Once the habit of frugality is formed, it is possible to avoid the attention of others and unreasonable desires. The reason why Qu Fangpu admonished female employees is to advocate simplicity. We also say that attention should be paid to cultivation. If these two are combined, it will be helpful. Take the previous failure as a warning and hope that the past can be followed. Advocates of women's rights, can they not pay attention to this?</p>
<h3>August 18th Commemorative Festival: Soviet Russia Promotes Aviation Construction</h3>
<p>Complete Air Force Equipment Provides Powerful Guarantee of Peace. Technical Progress Surpasses Developed Countries.</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Union is commemorating Aviation Day for the first time nationwide, which the government recently designated to be held annually on August 18th. Also, today is the fifteenth anniversary of the founding of the Red Army Air Force, so the two commemorative ceremonies are being held simultaneously. Prior to this year's Aviation Day, an extensive propaganda campaign was held, indicating that the continued development of Soviet civil aviation, such as the construction of airplanes and airships, the establishment of air stations, the opening of airports, and the expansion of airline routes, are all necessary. In his order issued today, People's Commissar for the Army and Navy Voroshilov listed the achievements of Soviet aviation, stating, "The Red Army Air Force is now extremely well-equipped, and we are confident that we have a firm grasp of completing our historical mission through intense and strong work in the future. At the same time, technically, we can not only keep pace with the most advanced capitalist countries but also surpass them without a doubt." On this occasion, newspapers point out that the distinctive development of Soviet heavy industry, especially the manufacturing of extremely sophisticated instruments, electrical technology, and the production of high-quality steel and aluminum, has made the progress of aviation construction possible. All newspapers cite Stalin's frequent reminders of the fact that the Soviet Union has created its own aviation industry, which is unprecedented. All newspapers also point out that in the four years of the first Five-Year Plan, the number of airplanes has tripled, the tonnage has increased fivefold, and the production of airplane engines has increased sixfold. At the same time, a large number of air routes have been opened, now totaling 36,000 kilometers, including the major Moscow-Vladivostok line, the Moscow-Tashkent line, and the Moscow-Tbilisi line. At the same time, civil aviation, as a tool for socialist creation, is expanding its use in agriculture and forestry, and is used to exterminate pests in the fields and wildfires in the mountains and forests, escort scientific expeditions, and transport gold, fur, and other valuable goods. In explaining the characteristics of Soviet aviation, the press states that it is a factor in promoting culture and developing national productivity, and the Air Force is in line with the Soviet government's vigorous pursuit of a peaceful government, with the responsibility of defending the socialist motherland. To commemorate this first Aviation Day, the Soviet Central Executive Committee has awarded the Lenin Medal, the Red Star Medal, and several honorary medals to workers in the aviation industry, civil aviation, the Association for Aviation and Chemical Defense, the Red Army, the Red Army Air Force, and other institutions.

<h3>Japanese Minister of the Army Araki's Talk to American Journalists</h3>
<p>Believes in Force and Criticizes the League of Nations. Calls the Invasion of Manchuria Self-Defense.</p>
<p>(New York) Mr. Cooper, President of the Associated Press, recently visited Japan. Army Minister Araki made a statement to him, which the Associated Press has now released. According to Araki, Japan's desire to coordinate with other countries is clear, but it is often met with hostility. In 1896, Japan defeated China, but Russia, France, and Germany rose up to intervene, forcing Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula to China. However, at that time, France, Germany, and England all had a firm foothold in Chinese territory. How can Japan be solely blamed? In 1924, the United States also abolished the Gentlemen's Agreement with Japan. During the Great War, Japan assisted all countries with a frank attitude, but at the time of the peace talks after the war, the countries that had suffered together did not allow the Japanese to obtain equality on social issues, such as the self-governing territories of the British Empire, such as Canada and Australia, which actually made it impossible for the Japanese to gain a foothold. Araki also believed that the international treaties and agreements successively concluded after the Great War were of no benefit to Japan. All countries often used these treaties to oppose Japan. Therefore, when Japan was in a position of legitimate defense in Manchuria in 1931, Japan only relied on its strength, courage, determination, and foresight and did not appeal to international peace institutions, because these institutions were slow to act, clumsy in their actions, and unclear about the facts. Araki concluded that it seems that "relying on our own strength is the only way to guarantee our independence and protect our vital interests and rights." In the second part of the talk, Araki explained why Japan does not follow the West, saying that "Western culture is disappointing, so Japan abandons it and restores its traditional thought, using the spirit of Bushido as a model," etc. (18th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Heated Debate Between Chinese and Japanese Representatives at the Pacific Institute</h3>
<p>Chinese Representative Claims Boycott as a Tool for China's Self-Defense. British Memorandum Indicates Japan's Obstruction of Cotton Textile Interests.</p>
<p>(Banff) Chinese and Japanese representatives at the Pacific Institute today debated the issue of boycotting Japanese goods fiercely. The Japanese representative said that the threat of boycotting goods is even greater than using the army or navy alone. The Chinese representative replied that boycotting goods is China's only means of self-defense in the current situation. Once Japan stops its aggression in Manchuria, the Chinese people's boycott of goods will naturally end, and he vigorously denied that the boycott of Japanese goods was directed by the Chinese government, but admitted that certain bans were imposed by the Chinese government. Finally, the Chinese representative suggested that the act of boycotting goods, if not caused by the other party's aggression, should be listed as an illegal political weapon. (18th Kuo Min News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Banff) At the meeting of the Pacific Institute, Japanese representative Takahashi declared that the method of restricting production cannot solve the problem of Japan's overpopulation. He said, "The number of Japanese people who are able to work will exceed the current number by more than 10 million by 1950. The number of people who should be placed in work will also be 200,000 more than it is now each year. It is unreasonable to confine such a constantly expanding nation to a small island and it is dangerous to world peace."</p>
<p>The British delegation submitted a memorandum on the export of Japanese cotton textiles, stating that Japan's promotion of sales markets hinders British interests. Japan focuses on selling goods and does not consider the value of goods. The Japanese government also assists its export merchants with various methods under its power. The memorandum concludes that "if British cotton textile producers want to compete with Japan, the British government must also provide assistance." (18th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Outline of the Japanese Instructions for the India-Japan Trade Conference</h3>
<p>Awaiting Formal Cabinet Decision</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The instruction proposal carried by the two representatives attending the Simla Conference, Sawada and Temple, was discussed at a meeting of the six relevant ministries at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 AM today. The two representatives also participated in the discussion. As a result, an administrative instruction proposal was decided. The proposal will be formally decided after it is submitted to the cabinet meeting on the 22nd. Its outline is as follows: (1) The Japan-India Trade Treaty should be based on the most-favored-nation treatment that ensures reciprocity. If it is difficult to conclude a formal treaty, efforts should be made to establish an agreement on commerce, navigation, and tariffs based on the above principles. (2) India should give preferential treatment to Japanese cotton yarn and other Japanese goods that do not threaten domestic industries. Japan will guarantee the import of a certain amount of Indian cotton and a reciprocal preferential agreement that does not threaten Japanese industries. (3) Although the current Japan-India treaty will not be without treaty relations after it expires, it requests that India establish a temporary agreement on methods. (4) It requests that after the treaty expires, Japanese goods will not be subject to higher tariffs. (19th Denstu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Passively Resists Australian Goods</h3>
<p>Reduced Imports of Wool. Planning Trade Balance.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of a joint meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce, the Wool Industry, and the Shipping Industry, it was decided to organize a Wool Committee. At the same time, it was also decided to balance Japan's trade with various countries. For nearly sixty years, Japan's trade has always been in a position of excess imports, but the commercial encroachment policy of the United Kingdom has forced Japan to implement a policy of balancing import and export trade. Japan currently purchases 140 million yen worth of goods from Australia each year, while Australia only purchases 36 million yen worth of goods from Japan. It has now been decided to ask Australia to purchase Japanese goods to the amount that Japan purchases from Australia. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Assassination of Prime Minister Inukai</h3>
<p>Army Court Debate Concluded. Prosecutors Request Eight Years of Penal Servitude. Reactionaries Agitate for Reduced Sentences. A Package Delivered to Araki's Residence. Horrifying Bloody Severed Fingers. (Tokyo) This morning, the public prosecutor requested that the eleven army officers involved in the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on May 15 last year be sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. The naval officers involved in the case have not yet been fully tried. Reactionaries across the country are now agitating vigorously, believing that the defendants were driven by patriotism to take irregular actions and should be given extraordinary leniency. (Reuter's telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prosecutor Kosaka requested eight years' imprisonment for each of the murderers at the Army Military Court this morning. His statement was lengthy, and the main points are as follows: 1. The May 15th Incident had a significant impact on various aspects of Japan's political society. The loss of Inukai and others to the murderous blade was also considerable in personal terms. 2. They caused much anxiety to the Emperor, and their crime was profound. 3. However, the actions of the murderers stemmed from extreme sincerity for the country. 4. The army murderers were not the initiators. For reasons 4 and 5, a sentence of eight years' imprisonment is appropriate. (China League News Agency telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, during the army trial of the May 15th Incident, Prosecutor Kosaka made the following statement: The significance of this incident lies in the fact that they deeply lamented the corruption and depravity of Japan's ruling class and their indulgence in private interests. They attempted to reform the country through direct action, uniting naval officers and others, taking up weapons, publicly intruding into the Prime Minister's official residence in broad daylight, assassinating the Prime Minister, and attacking the central police organs, the Bank of Japan, and others, obstructing the peace of the capital and disrupting the stability of society. This is, of course, a serious social crime, and their actions are contrary to the duties of soldiers. Even from a military perspective, it is unacceptable. The importance of maintaining military discipline, as evidenced by the various articles of the Army Criminal Law and all those prescribed from this perspective, is very clear. Therefore, the defendants, who took direct action based on their private opinions without the initiation of command authority, even if their motives were said to have arisen from extreme patriotism, must be said to have committed serious misconduct that disrupted military discipline. As for the causes of the incident, 1. Dissatisfaction with the disregard for national defense, the problem of infringing on command authority in the naval disarmament issue, and the stimulation of military prestige led to the desire to overthrow their ruling class. 2. The defendants were inspired by reading the history of the Meiji Restoration, believing at this time that death for the sake of the country was the duty of soldiers. In order to break the deadlock of Japan's national crisis, they believed that even strict military discipline was unnecessary. 3. Disregard for national law and military discipline: the defendants took direct action, disregarding the violation of national law and the disruption of military discipline, which was a disregard for national law and military regulations. The actions of the defendants, if judged according to the law, are suitable for the crime of rebellion under Article 25 of the Army Criminal Law, and in addition to the crime of rebellion, some of the defendants also have the crimes of attempted murder and violation of regulations on controlling explosives. However, in general, such actions include the crime of rebellion and should not be attached to other crimes, so the defendants cannot be judged differently based on different circumstances. As for the request for imprisonment of eight years for all defendants, and at 10:10, lawyer Nakagawa made a defense, although he agreed with the prosecutor's statement regarding the suitability of military criminal law, he pointed out the fact of the nationwide surging movement for leniency, and presented a little finger sent to Army Minister Araki, insisting that the true value of the law arises from its application, and that the defendants all confessed, so if leniency is not considered, it is indeed a mistake. The court was adjourned at 11:20, and the next hearing is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. on the 21st. (Telegraphic communication, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In the May 15 assassination case, the eleven army murderers, including Goto Einei, have been on trial at the First Division Headquarters Military Court for seven days since July 25. The interrogation has been completed, and the prosecutor's indictment is scheduled to begin at 8:00 a.m. this morning. According to the army's opinion, the naval murderers were the initiators, and the army was merely the followers. Judging by this opinion, the army's request for punishment can be used to predict the naval murderers' request for punishment. Therefore, today's Prosecutor Kosaka's request for punishment is very worthy of attention both domestically and abroad. (China League News Agency telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the army's request for eight years' imprisonment for the murderers of the May 15th Incident, Imamura Rikizaburo said: In 1922, Wang Gengyi assassinated former Prime Minister Hara, and the Tokyo High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment. In 1924, during the Great Kanto Earthquake, Lieutenant Amakasu Masahiko assassinated Osugi Sakae's family and was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. Lieutenant Amakasu is currently the director of the police department of the pseudo-Fengtian Province. This time, the May 15th Incident, which shocked China and foreign countries, is actually seeking a sentence of eight years' imprisonment. This is too far from the facts in the history of Japanese criminal law and will be very relevant to Japan's criminal law policy in the future. It is unknown how the peasant suicide squad will be dealt with. (China League News Agency telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 4:00 p.m. on the 18th, ten severely sealed registered packages were suddenly mailed to Army Minister Araki's official residence. Captain Sugai opened them and saw a white wooden box, about 5 inches wide and 7 inches long, with the word "Presentation" written on it. Upon opening the lid, there were nine little fingers, covered in fresh blood, wrapped in three or four layers of white cloth. The senders of this item were eight people including Kono Toshiie of Hakusanura, Niigata City, who demanded a reduced sentence for the defendants in the May 15th Incident. Their method of petitioning was different from the ordinary, so it was startling. In addition, since the start of the trial, dozens of petitions for reduced sentences have been sent to the Ministry of the Army and the Army Minister's official residence by the post office every day. It is estimated that the number of signatories on the petitions and statements of circumstances is over 10,000. (Telegraphic communication, 19th)</p>
<h3>Senator Pittman Advocates Revising Sino-American Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Guarantees Silver Price Can Be Raised. The Largest Outlet for American Goods is China. (Washington) Senator Pittman broadcast to the nation tonight, guaranteeing that after the London Agreement is fully effective, the price of silver may rise to six or even seven shillings per ounce within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, the agreement can be said to be the greatest progress in silver in a century. He also stated that the increase in the price of silver can promote trade between the United States and China and Latin America. These countries are the natural markets for the United States. Pittman also advocated concluding new commercial treaties with China and Latin American countries, because the current commercial treaties have not been very effective since the fall in the price of silver. Among them, the Sino-American commercial treaty is particularly necessary to be concluded first, because China is the world's largest potential market. After the price of silver is raised, it will become the largest foreign market for the United States. The Chinese people have always wanted to develop close business relations with the United States. After the price of silver is raised, American merchants and the Chinese people will benefit from it. Since 1928, the daily fall in the price of silver has greatly hindered Sino-American trade. Now that this obstacle has been removed, the United States can immediately restore its past foreign trade. (National News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>American Recovery Movement: Government Efforts to Eliminate Obstacles</h3>
<p>Three Major Industrial Laws and Regulations Face Many Twists and Turns in Negotiations. Roosevelt is Consistently Unwilling to Use Power Lightly. (Washington) Tonight, the U.S. government's efforts to persuade the three major industries in the country to comply with the recovery plan have reached the final emergency period. Everyone believes that if U.S. President and Industrial Recovery Administrator Johnson can overcome the current difficulties, then the struggle to achieve national cooperation between the people and the government will have reached a successful conclusion. Even if an emergency situation occurs in the future, it will only be a matter of the success of the recovery plan itself, not a problem of cooperation between the people and the government. It is heard that before tonight, the U.S. government believed that its negotiations with the petroleum, coal, and steel industries were nearing completion. Unexpectedly, there were new twists and turns, causing the coal industry representatives who came to Beijing to discuss some minor issues with Johnson to suddenly announce the postponement of the meeting and simultaneously announce that negotiations between the Recovery Administration and the steel industry had fallen into a stalemate. Small, independently operated oil companies also stopped signing the petroleum industry regulations. However, the reasons for the postponement of the coal industry representatives' meeting and the stalemate in the steel industry negotiations have not been announced. As for the independently operated oil companies, because various states have already formulated regulations on production, and these people have finally obtained these favorable regulations after several struggles, they oppose the federal government's supervision of production. Furthermore, although major companies have agreed to all regulations drafted by the Recovery Administration, including the wage scale and crude oil price list, the independent small oil companies require that the prices of refined kerosene also be fixed. However, the U.S. President has always approached these complex situations with patience, without showing any signs of annoyance or anger, discussing and earnestly persuading the representatives of various industries on the various details of the employment regulations. Although the representatives of various industries felt the President's sincerity, they were most insistent on a few points, especially the methods for labor-management negotiations and prices, due to their own interests, and were unwilling to give up easily. Although the President has broad powers to compel various industries to comply, and his advisors have suggested using this great power to achieve a quick and decisive effect, the President is still unwilling to use his power lightly tonight. It is said that the U.S. President does not want to force progress in conquering economic decline, but hopes that officials and the people will work together to advance. The President once told industry leaders that some of his proposals are only experimental in nature, and if they are ineffective, they can be canceled. At the same time, he pointed out that in the past ten years, each industry has been allowed to act on its own will, but it has not been able to promote prosperity. Now that the government is coming forward to plan for it, it is hoped that the people will sincerely support it. Tonight, a certain gentleman from the Industrial Recovery Administration said that all major industries have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the government, but they are doing their best to resist when it will have an adverse impact on their special interests. Everyone claims that the nature of their industry is different and requires special treatment. They do not know that if the entire plan is to succeed, it must be based on the opposite concept. In any case, the government cannot have special treatment. In fact, all industries make the same request, but in the end, they abandon their claims. The U.S. government has so far succeeded in other major recovery plans. Southern farmers have already voluntarily destroyed a portion of their cotton seedlings, manufacturers are willing to pay handling fees, the banking industry has accepted the new laws, and there are few complaints about difficulties. Other major industries have also accepted the regulations proposed by the government, and the unemployment relief plan has produced concrete results. As for the unemployment relief plan, the U.S. President has decided to maintain the forestry and water conservancy workers he has recruited over the winter. There are currently 300,000 people employed, and there are many people dredging rivers and reclaiming wasteland for afforestation. It is said that the work will be more effective after the land freezes, and if they are dismissed in winter, it will lead to a large number of surplus workers being dumped on the market, which will be detrimental to the recovery of the economy. Moreover, public construction can have the effect of moderating inflation, so it will continue to advance at the current scale to get through the winter. (National News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Steel Industry's New Regulations Approved</h3>
<p>(Washington) The new regulations for the steel industry have now been approved by President Roosevelt, stipulating an average of 40 hours per week within three months. Each worker can work up to 48 hours in a six-day week. After November 1, or when production reaches 60% of capacity, all permanent employees will work eight hours per day. This regulation has a trial period of 90 days. The agreement states the steel industry's opinion that the lowest wage in the fixed regulations can exceed an average of 4 shillings per hour. Employees have the right to form unions with some restrictions. (Reuter's telegram, 79th)</p>

<h3>Italo-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>The Definition of Aggressor Not Clearly Defined. But Provides Russia with Economic Security. Havas, Rome, 18th. The Italo-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is about to be signed. Its content is clearly different from the similar treaties recently signed by the Soviet Union with various countries (i.e., Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, and the Little Entente countries). Italy and the Soviet Union have no common border. The so-called non-aggression seems to be an ideal regulation. However, Italy's purpose in concluding this treaty is to allow other countries to join later. For example, after the Soviet Union signed non-aggression treaties with Eastern European countries in London, Bulgaria was unable to join due to the Macedonian issue and the definition of an aggressor, and fell into isolation. The completion of the new Italo-Soviet treaty can enable Bulgaria to join this treaty. As for the "definition of an aggressor" proposed by Greek Foreign Minister Politis, Italy is unwilling to include it in the new treaty. However, it is stipulated that in the event of economic aggression, the contracting countries agree not to take economic measures that could be regarded as hostile acts by the other party. The contracting countries agree not to join any diplomatic alliances or compromises that could hinder the other contracting party. This regulation can provide security to the Soviet Union, because after the recent Four-Power Pact was established, the Soviet Union felt uneasy about its interpretation. With this new treaty, the Soviet Union can rest easy. Also, if various new agreements including several countries are established in Central and Eastern Europe, this provision will be particularly beneficial.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 19th. French newspapers announced the conclusion of the Italo-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact with large headlines. The absence of clauses clearly defining the nature of the "aggressor" has attracted the attention of various newspapers, as this is one of the main elements for maintaining peace. France attaches great importance to the interpretation of "aggression."</p>
<h3>German Radio Exhibition: Communication Over 8,000 Miles</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 18th. German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels gave his first long-distance telephone speech at the radio exhibition today. He first connected to Bangkok, Siam, 8,500 kilometers from Berlin, and then connected to the North German Company's mail ship Bremen, 4,000 kilometers away at sea. He exchanged greetings with both locations.</p>
<h3>Austrian Chancellor Visits Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Strict Suppression of National Socialism. Havas, Vienna, 19th. At the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Chancellor Dollfuss recently flew to Rimini, Italy, to meet with Mussolini. According to well-informed sources, Dollfuss and Mussolini will discuss issues related to the two countries, especially the German-Austrian dispute. (Havas telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 18th. The Austrian authorities are still using high-pressure tactics to deal with people who are inclined towards National Socialism. Three Germans who had been living in Vienna for a long time were deported today and released at the German border, because the police accused them of conspiring with Austrian National Socialist Party members. Several Austrians and Germans have also been sentenced to imprisonment ranging from one to four weeks for wearing National Socialist swastikas and giving National Socialist salutes to each other.</p>
<h3>Adventurous Climb to High Peak</h3>
<p>Four English Teachers Fall Off Cliff. Reuter, Bernese Oberland, Switzerland, 18th. Four teachers from Eton College, known for their mountaineering skills, recently climbed the high peaks of the Alps in Switzerland. They departed from Samedan on the 16th of this month, planning to make one last adventure before returning to England. They did not bring guides with them. They spent the night in the Serescia hut on the mountainside. On Thursday, they climbed the Roseg Peak, but while descending, they went astray and slipped on the ice, falling hundreds of feet and dying at the foot of the cliff. The bodies have not yet been found, but the four bodies are embracing each other, faintly visible. The first to discover this tragedy was a guide who was on the Roseg Peak in the Bernina Alps (13,000 feet above sea level). He only saw ice axes and snow goggles, but not the people. He then saw the bodies at the bottom of the cliff, so he hurried back to report to the police. The rescue team set off immediately, but could not reach the scene of the accident until Saturday. The four victims were all well-known figures in Eton. One, Powell, was a rowing champion, a Cambridge athlete from 1906 to 1910, and won the Diamond Sculls Award in 1912. Another, Thomson, was a science teacher, the eldest son of Bishop Ayer. Another, Howson, was the eldest grandson of Headmaster Dr. Butter. Another, Slater, was also an Eton teacher. All four were unmarried.</p>
<h3>Denies Inciting Political Turmoil</h3>
<p>Letter to the Pope Not From His Hand</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 18th. The National Socialist Party's central organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, recently published a letter claiming to be from former Chancellor Brüning, who has now entered a monastery to become a monk, to those around the Pope, warning the church not to conclude a treaty of separation of church and state with the German National Socialist government. Brüning has now published his reply, absolutely denying that this letter came from his hand. Therefore, it is expected that all the rumors that have arisen as a result of this can gradually subside with Brüning's denial.</p>
<h3>Indian Government Prepares to Release Gandhi</h3>
<p>Facilitate the Fight for the Untouchables</p>
<p>But Must End Non-Violent Resistance</p>
<p>Simla, 18th. A communiqué was released here stating that the Indian government is very satisfied with giving Gandhi great convenience to continue his movement for the untouchables in prison. If Gandhi believes that he cannot work freely, even if he lives in the world, it is meaningless, then the government is prepared to release him immediately, but Gandhi must abandon all non-violent resistance activities. The authorities have now notified Gandhi of this.</p>
<p>Havas, Bombay, 18th. Since Gandhi resumed his hunger strike in prison, the government has taken strict precautions to prevent him from contacting the outside world. Several British people have been allowed to meet with Gandhi in prison, but they declined to comment on the matters discussed, only saying that Gandhi was weaker than before and was lying in bed to conserve his strength. Prominent Indian leaders are rushing to Poona to find a way to resolve the deadlock.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water in Lanfeng Flows into Old Course</h3>
<p>More Than 600 Villages and Towns in Hua County, Northern Henan, Have Become a Swamp.</p>
<p>The River Water Overflowed from Zhenpu Village, Flooding 2,000 Acres of Farmland</p>
<p>Kaocheng is Five Feet Deep, County Government Relocates</p>
<p>Kaifeng Continues to Build City Wall Dikes</p>
<p>Kaifeng Communication. The water situation in the Heigang Estuary of the Yellow River and the flooding situation in Lanfeng have been detailed in the 11th communication. Although the people's hearts are slightly more settled than before, the river water is still changing constantly during this autumn flood season. On the 15th, six dams in the Shangxun of Zhongmu collapsed six zhang in the downstream corner, and the Touba of the Seventh Fortress continued to collapse severely. The Shunhe Dam of the 19th Fortress in the Shangxun of Xianghe (because Kaifeng was originally Xiangfu County, the Yellow River around Bianyuan is called Xianghe), and the Touba of the 20th Fortress, the drifting situation was urgent, and throwing stones was ineffective. It was only after hanging willows that it became peaceful. At about 6:00 p.m. that day, the Da Liu in the head of the middle Xuns of Xianghe, namely Heigang Estuary, moved north, and the defense gradually became gentle. Although the people on the north bank still thought it was dangerous, the people in Bianyuan thought it was a good phenomenon. At about 3:00 p.m. on the 16th, the Da Liu suddenly rolled to the south bank, with a fierce momentum, causing the one, two, three, and four Ren Zi dams to collapse. After transporting stones to rush to repair, a dam was built by evening. At night, 5,000 sacks were transported from the city straight until this morning, and the remaining dams were gradually successful. However, there are still thousands of people working in Heigang, and 200 people in Zhongmu. The Lanfeng County magistrate is also rushing to build projects with the people.</p>
<h3>Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>The disaster area this time, Hua County in northern Henan, was affected by the breach in Changyuan County, Hebei Province. According to the county magistrate's telegram to the Provincial Relief Association yesterday, all areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were irrigated. The water surface is 50 li east and west and 100 li north and south, with a depth of one zhang or several feet. More than 600 villages have been flooded, and more than 200 have completely collapsed. The vast ocean is boundless. The water is still rising without decreasing. The villages and towns have become swamps. Many of the old and weak have been eaten by fish. The young and strong who climbed trees and roofs are still falling into the water and committing suicide because there are few lifeboats.</p>
<h3>Flooding Situation</h3>
<p>The Yellow River in Lanfeng enters from the west of the county and turns north to Leiji. Because the water is too high and cannot be diverted in time, it goes straight east, causing the Cao to overflow from the river boundary of Zhenpu Village and flow into the old course of the Yellow River, passing under the north of the city and heading east, washing the place into a mouth. At first, it was only more than 40 zhang, but now it has been washed to more than 100 zhang. Both sides of the river have become swamps. It is estimated that more than 60 villages have been flooded, more than 2,000 acres of farmland, and people and animals have been washed away. It is impossible to count the number of people who have been flooded in Kaocheng, which passes through. The water enters the city, which is more than five feet deep. The county government moved to He Zhuang, about three li from the city, to handle business. More than 40 prisoners escaped and died, the files were lost, and the collection of funds was lost. The number of people who were flooded and killed cannot be counted. The disaster areas in Wen County, Mengjin, and Fanshui are also hundreds of li wide. Although the Provincial Relief Association has resolved to appeal to charitable organizations across the country for relief and has sent a letter to the provincial government to allocate 100,000 yuan for relief, quenching thirst with plums and putting a cup of water on a cartload of firewood, it is feared that the disaster victims will not be able to obtain much benefit. As for the defense work in Kaifeng, the three halls of civil affairs, finance, and construction, together with the 35th Division's Ma Jiaoteng Department, are building the city wall dike, which is still considered to be working hard. However, the largest gap is four or five li long, which cannot be completed in a day. The River Affairs Bureau, which is responsible for river defense, has always been regarded as a lucrative position, reporting small dangers as big dangers and profiting from them. Once a real danger arrives, they are at a loss. A few days ago, Fang Qidao, the secretary-general of the provincial government, said that the stone materials stored in Heigang Estuary were purchased during the Qing Dynasty, and they have been exhausted after throwing stones and building dams for days. Four sailing ships were specially sent to Gong County to transport stones, but three of them sank when they returned through the Yellow River Iron Bridge, which shows the neglect of duty of the bureau.</p>
<h3>Superstition of the Ignorant</h3>
<p>The people of Bianyuan call the god</p>
<p>of water the Great King. It has been going on for</p>
<p>who knows how many years. In the Qing Dynasty, on the spring and autumn days, they still worshiped</p>
<p>the Great King, performing dramas to thank the gods. After the Republic of China, bad customs gradually changed. On the 12th, a small snake, red with a black texture, was suddenly found on a stone in the Octagonal Pavilion inside the Great South Gate. The people, who were already frightened, were afraid of the water and believed that the Great King had come. The more they spread it, the more mysterious it became. As a result, there were crowds of people vying to worship. In the afternoon, the director of the River Affairs Bureau paid for a blue ne轿轿 to be carried to Liuyuan Estuary by the Nanqu Office. On the 13th, they performed lion dances and land boats to thank the Great King. For days, the so-called good men and women gathered groups, solicited donations door to door to buy yellow paper incense towers, and blew up firecrackers to carry them to the river bank and burn them. When the reporter was writing, he still heard the sound of cymbals and gongs, mixed with the shouts of "Gather at the North Gate, go to send the incense tower and kowtow!" (August 17)</p>
<h3>Frequent Yellow Water Warnings in Xuzhou Area</h3>
<p>Yellow Water Follows Dasha River and Bends North</p>
<p>Northwest of Xuzhou Has Become a Swamp</p>
<p>Xuzhou Communication. The Yellow River in Hebei and Shandong breached its banks, and the water flowed south from Caozhou. On the 16th, it reached Dangshan via Shan County. The situation in the Xuzhou area suddenly became urgent. Alarms were frequent in one day. The people of Xubu were trembling with fear, and the military and civilians were mobilized to rush to block the dikes. On the 17th, the water passed Dangshan to Gaozhai, followed the Dasha River and bent north. Although Xubu was temporarily safe, the north attacked Fengpei, the hometown of Liu Bang, and suddenly became dangerous. At this moment, the northwest of Xuzhou has been flooded. Whether the southeast can be completely preserved depends on the speed and changes of the water situation in the future. The following is a record of the disaster.</p>
<h3>Abolished Yellow River Situation</h3>
<p>Before the sixth year of the reign of Emperor Xianfeng of the defeated Qing dynasty, the Xu region was an area traversed by the Yellow River. The river channel came from the south of Kaocheng in eastern Henan, passed the southern border of Shan County in western Shandong, entered the northern border of Changshan in the Xu region, passed the northern border of Xiao County in the east, surrounded the northwest, east, and three sides of the Tongshan County seat, and flowed southeast through Suqian. In the sixth year of Xianfeng, the Tongwaxiang breach shifted north, and the river left Xu. To this day, the abandoned Yellow River course still exists in Dangshan, Xiao, Tongshan, Suqian. The embankments are still there, but they are already dilapidated. Over the years, the riverbed has silted up with sand, rising several feet above the flat farmland on both banks, but the river shape is still vaguely present. The abandoned channel in Changshan is about twenty miles north of Dangcheng, passing through districts three and four. There are large dams on both banks. The one in Xiao County is far from the county seat, passing through districts seven and eight. The one in Tongshan passes through districts 1, 5, 6, 9, and 10, and the river channel in district one is less than a few feet away from the city. Therefore, there are stone embankments surrounding the city, and the embankments are reinforced with a mixture of glutinous rice, lime, sand, and gravel, making them extremely solid. Unfortunately, they have been demolished for years, resulting in many gaps. The ones in the Suqian area pass through northern Suqian and reach eastern Suqian. Suining is relatively far from the city, while Suqian is close to the county seat. The embankments have also been in disrepair for a long time. In previous years, floods in the plains of eastern Henan would follow the abandoned channel eastward and flow down. During dry and peaceful seasons, the abandoned channel is filled with wide fields of mulberry and hemp. Boats and oars have disappeared, and the sand dunes are ten feet high, which shows that the river is truly abandoned. According to surveyors, if the river shifts south, there is no reason for it to return to the old channel in the Xu region, because the old channel is higher than the flat farmland, and the water cannot flow smoothly along it. If it floods and flows horizontally, it can overflow anywhere along the channel, causing considerable damage.</p>
<h3>Xu Port Sounding the Alarm</h3>
<p>On the morning of the sixteenth, the news of the</p>
<p>Yellow River's arrival at Dangshan reached here, and</p>
<p>people's hearts immediately became alarmed.</p>
<p>Administrative Commissioner She Nianci,</p>
<p>summoned people from all walks of life the day before</p>
<p>to organize a Yellow River Embankment Repair Committee.</p>
<p>Then, he sent telegrams to Dangshan, Fengxian, and Xiao counties to make proper defenses,</p>
<p>and to report the water situation at any time.</p>
<p>Garrison Commander Zeng Wanzhong immediately dispatched a regiment from the Seventh Division stationed in Xu,</p>
<p>and Huang Meixing, the brigade commander of the Eighty-eighth Division stationed in Xu, also dispatched two battalions</p>
<p>to set off at 3 PM to repair the surrounding city embankments.</p>
<p>The county government prepared gunny sacks, hemp bags, wooden stakes, sorghum stalks, iron bells, and baskets, etc.,</p>
<p>and worked through the night.</p>
<p>That evening, the head of the water had already passed Dali Village in eastern Dangshan,</p>
<p>and the situation became even more urgent.</p>
<p>On the morning of the seventeenth, She Nianci ordered the first district office to announce</p>
<p>a general mobilization of the people in all townships and towns to repair the embankments together,</p>
<p>from Woniu Mountain in the west to Jijui Dam in the south,</p>
<p>a length of fifteen miles, with no less than ten thousand people rushing to repair them.</p>
<p>By evening, they received news that the water had reached north of Gaozhai and turned,</p>
<p>flowing into the Dasha River and irrigating Fengxian and Peixian to the north.</p>
<p>The situation gradually eased.</p>
<p>Gaozhai is located in the easternmost part of Dangshan,</p>
<p>about a hundred miles away from Xu Port,</p>
<p>which comforted people a lot.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter patrolled and inspected the embankment for fifteen miles,</p>
<p>divided into three major sections.</p>
<p>The first major section is from Woniu Mountain to Hongfu Temple west of the North Gate,</p>
<p>with eight gaps.</p>
<p>The westernmost gap at Jiuligou was repaired by the villagers of Duanzhuang Township.</p>
<p>The three gaps in the outer embankment of the Daoguang River</p>
<p>were built by the first and second battalions and the artillery and engineering battalions of the 39th Regiment of the 19th Brigade of the Seventh Division,</p>
<p>supervised by the artillery battalion commander Yang Fang.</p>
<p>The four gaps from Xiaoxibeimen to Hongfu Temple</p>
<p>were built by the first and third battalions of the 527th Regiment of the Eighty-eighth Division,</p>
<p>led by the battalion adjutant Li Tang.</p>
<p>Each soldier wore hats made of willow branches or sorghum leaves to protect them from the scorching sun,</p>
<p>and their spirits were exceptionally high.</p>
<p>The second major section is from Hongfu Temple, passing through the North Gate and East Gate, to the New East Gate,</p>
<p>with four gaps.</p>
<p>However, because the East City is a transportation artery,</p>
<p>only remote areas were repaired</p>
<p>separately by the people of the northwest and east three passes.</p>
<p>The people of each town held red and white flags as markers,</p>
<p>with the words "Embankment Protection and Rush Blocking Team" written on them,</p>
<p>and enthusiastically engaged in the work,</p>
<p>which was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The third major section is from the New East Gate to Jijui Dam south of Kuishan,</p>
<p>with five gaps in total,</p>
<p>of which the gaps at Huoshen Temple and Jijui were the largest,</p>
<p>repaired by the villagers of Yuanqiao and Kuishan townships and the people of the South Pass.</p>
<p>The traffic on South Ma Road was also temporarily blocked with earthworks.</p>
<p>When the reporter patrolled to Jijui Dam,</p>
<p>the sun was already setting in the mountains,</p>
<p>but the people carrying clocks and tampers were still working non-stop,</p>
<p>which shows that they can all work hard for the public and share the same boat.</p>
<p>Looking at the gaps as a whole, most of them were destroyed for traffic,</p>
<p>interrupting the embankments</p>
<p>to serve as thoroughfares.</p>
<p>The terrain inside the city is more than thirty feet lower than the top of the embankment,</p>
<p>while the riverbed outside the embankment is less than ten feet lower,</p>
<p>and the city walls were demolished at 6 PM,</p>
<p>leaving the city without any protection.</p>
<p>If the Yellow River overflows,</p>
<p>we can only sigh for its fish.</p>
<p>Those who advocated demolishing the embankments and dismantling the city at that time</p>
<p>truly did not expect this.</p>
<h3>Water Irrigating Feng and Pei</h3>
<p>After the Yellow River passed Dali Village and came east,</p>
<p>on the morning of the seventeenth, it had reached Gaozhai.</p>
<p>Gaozhai is located on the north bank of the old river channel in the eastern part of Dangshan.</p>
<p>A few miles further east is Panlongji.</p>
<p>During the Daoguang reign of the defeated Qing dynasty, the Yellow River once breached at Panlong,</p>
<p>passing north between Fengxian and Peixian and flowing into Zhaoyang Lake and Weishan Lake.</p>
<p>After the river recovered, the people of Fengxian and Peixian built a dam here.</p>
<p>At that time, the people of Xiao and Dangshan also built a dam across the river southeast of Panlong,</p>
<p>to block the water and force it into Fengxian and Peixian.</p>
<p>When the river shifted, the north breach became the Dasha River.</p>
<p>The people of Fengxian and Peixian had dredged it</p>
<p>to provide water for irrigation,</p>
<p>so that the water from Zhaoyang Lake could be released to irrigate the fields.</p>
<p>The dam built by Xiao and Dangshan still exists,</p>
<p>called the Erba Dam.</p>
<p>To this day, the old course of the Erba Dam is particularly high,</p>
<p>and the Sha River is about ten feet lower.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the Yellow River reaches here, it sharply turns north,</p>
<p>flows into the Sha River, and backflows into Zhaoyang Lake and Weishan Lake, attacking Fengxian and Peixian to the north.</p>
<p>Earlier, Fengxian County Magistrate Yang Liang, seeing the Yellow River flowing east, immediately led the people to block it at Gaozhai,</p>
<p>and Peixian also sent 7,000 laborers to assist.</p>
<p>However, because the water was fierce and the river was low,</p>
<p>they were unable to resist it.</p>
<p>It flowed down, but the Erba Dam was very high,</p>
<p>so the water in the old channel could not come east without breaking through the Erba Dam.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the people of Xiao and Dangshan also added to the Erba Dam</p>
<p>to prevent the water from flowing east.</p>
<p>Therefore, at present, the interests of Fengxian and Peixian conflict with those of Dangshan and Xiao.</p>
<p>However, since the water has already invaded Fengxian and Peixian to the north, it is already irreversible.</p>
<p>Both banks of the Sha River have been flooded.</p>
<p>This morning (the 18th), Fengxian telegraphed that the water had passed Huashan and was less than twenty miles away from the city.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most of it passed through Songlou and Baimiao to Peixian, so Fengcheng may be spared danger.</p>
<p>At the same time, Peixian called, saying that the head of the water had reached Youfang, twenty miles west of the city,</p>
<p>exceeding Lilou and flowing towards Zhaoyang Lake.</p>
<p>Peicheng is located more than ten miles south of Zhaoyang Lake.</p>
<p>Peixian County Magistrate has prepared dozens of large boats,</p>
<p>moored on the shore of the lake to prepare for rescue.</p>
<p>Even if Fengcheng is spared, Peicheng will also be affected by the disaster,</p>
<p>because it is close to the lake.</p>
<p>She Nianci sent Wang Shicai, the head of the Public Security Bureau, to Huangkou to survey the water yesterday.</p>
<p>He returned to Xu that evening.</p>
<p>According to him, he went from Huangkou to Gaozhai to observe the water head, which was ten feet high and five miles wide, with a very fierce flow.</p>
<p>The Erba Dam is indeed a guarantee to block the water in the old river channel,</p>
<p>but the unimaginable situation in Fengxian and Peixian can also be inferred.</p>
<h3>Rising Water in Weishan Lake</h3>
<p>The old course of the Yellow River is indeed a disaster for the Xu region.</p>
<p>North of Xu, there is also Weishan Lake, which is connected to Zhaoyang Lake,</p>
<p>receiving the Nanyang Lake in southern Shandong and connecting to the Grand Canal downstream.</p>
<p>Passing south of Hanzhuang, it flows towards Pixian and Suqian.</p>
<p>On the south bank of Weishan Lake, there is also a river that passes through Zhanggushan and Linshan to Wanzhai, ten miles north of Xubu.</p>
<p>Turning east, it becomes the Jingshan River and Bulao River, which also enter the Pi Canal.</p>
<p>However, north of the city embankment, behind Zifang Mountain, it should not affect the city.</p>
<p>According to road news yesterday, Weishan Lake receives river water from western Shandong and flows into the Grand Canal.</p>
<p>The area around Pao Che and Nian Zhuang on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has already seen rising water.</p>
<p>However, this water is definitely not water that flows north from Fengxian and Peixian and flows downstream through Zhaoyang Lake and Weishan Lake.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that it is water that directly enters Nanyang Lake from western Shandong, because Dingtao in western Shandong is already in the water.</p>
<p>If water that flows north from Fengxian and Peixian is added, the water in Weishan Lake will be even greater,</p>
<p>and Pixian and Suqian will also be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Even north of Xubu, there is a danger of flooding.</p>
<p>Today, the administrative authorities have taken precautions against the Chediankou and Suyao areas south of Wanzhai.</p>
<p>Administrative personnel telegraphed Xubu yesterday, inquiring about the water situation,</p>
<p>fearing that the water in the old course would not be enough to cause trouble for Suyao,</p>
<p>and that the water in the Grand Canal would be more than enough to cause trouble.</p>
<p>This is also a common concern in northern Jiangsu, and it is urgent to think about how to prevent it.</p>
<p>She Nianci telegraphed Suqian and Suining today (the 18th), saying, "Most of the Yellow River water has entered the Dasha River from Gaozhai and Panlongji, flowing north towards Fengxian and Peixian, and may combine with the Shandong water and flow into the Grand Canal. Please pay attention to prevention."</p>
<p>This is indeed an inevitable trend. (August 18th)</p>
<h3>Discussion of the Yellow River's Destination</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province is its tail end</p>
<p>Weishan Lake is its destination</p>
<p>Peixian suffers the most</p>
<p>After the Yellow River breached in Henan Province, the water flowed directly into Shandong and Jiangsu Provinces. According to Mr. Yang Jingwu of Peixian, the destination of the water in the future deserves attention for the study of this flood. The letter from Mr. Yang is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Recently, various newspapers have carried telegrams from various places in Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu Provinces, reporting that the water flowing east from the south bank of the Yellow River is extremely turbulent. However, regardless of the rise and fall of the water level in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the water will eventually flow into Weishan Lake, and the people of Peixian who live around the lake will suffer unimaginable damage. I was born in this land and have served the local area for many years. Based on my observations during my travels in western Shandong and what I have learned, I can speak in general terms and know how harmful it is. Writing this with a pen makes my heart tremble with fear.</p>
<p>There is more than one breach on the south bank of the Yellow River, all located at the junction of Shandong and Henan. The southeastward flow is roughly divided into two branches: one passes through Heze, Cao, Shan, Dingtao, Jiaxiang, Jinxiang, and Yutai counties in western Shandong and enters the Nanwang and Dushan lakes in the upper reaches of Weishan Lake; the other follows the abandoned Yellow River through Kaifeng, Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Guide in Henan, and reaches Feng, Dang, Xiao, Tong counties in Jiangsu Province, turning northeast and flowing into the Zhaoyang and Yinshan lakes in the lower reaches of Weishan Lake.</p>
<p>I have consulted the Treatise on River Management in the Huangchao Jingshi Wenbian, the local chronicles of the above counties, and my observations during my travels in Cao County, Shandong in the 14th year of the Republic of China, along with the current telegrams reporting the passage of water flows, and the fact that the bottom of the abandoned Yellow River is more than ten feet higher than the ground, and breaches in the north embankment are everywhere. Even if people rush to build it, it is difficult to prevent it from collapsing. In summary, I dare to say that the breached Yellow River will end up in Weishan Lake.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Weishan Lake spans Shandong and Jiangsu Provinces, belonging to seven counties, about three hundred miles long and thirty to forty miles wide. It was formed by the proposal of Zhang Diaohe and Jin Wenxiang during the Ming Dynasty to avoid the Yellow River, change the canal, and set up gates to store water. According to fishermen, the lake used to be more than twenty feet deep, but it has been silting up every year since the Qing Dynasty. In the autumn of the 15th year of the Republic of China, there was a major flood in Peixian, and the water situation was reported to the Shen Bao. Later, it was measured that the deepest point was more than fourteen feet, six or seven feet shallower than seventy years ago. From this, a coefficient can be obtained: on average, it silts up about one inch per year. Furthermore, the space occupied by the lake water in that year was roughly equal to the Xiaoxingshui when the Yellow River returned north in the seventh year of Xianfeng, which clearly proves that it has become a bottom lake. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, when the deputy engineer of the Huai River Guidance Association and the director of the Jiangsu Water Conservancy Bureau passed through Peixian, I reported this to them for reference in controlling various waters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the only outlet for the lake water is the long-abandoned and silted Grand Canal, and the Gunshui Jizui Dam in the upper reaches of the Bulao River. It is said that the dam is built very strongly, and during major floods, the people downstream prevent the upstream from secretly digging it, living on the dam day and night, guarding it with guns. There are no other outlets. Knowledgeable people have long recognized this and have proposed opening the Jizui Dam and guiding the Bulao River to discharge the lake water and cultivate the land to help the people of Peixian, not just once. Some propose but do not discuss it, some discuss but do not decide it, and some decide but delay it, all blocked by the general canal management forces in Jiangbei. This can be evidenced by the quarterly publications of the Yangzhou Canal Bureau over the years, causing the people who have paid the two-cent-per-mu donation for more than ten years to suffer the disaster of losing their homes and drowning. Thinking about it, how can one not grieve?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the water of the Yellow River flows east, with a vast and rapid current, and a flow rate of about one hundred and forty to fifty miles day and night. The gentlemen of the Yellow River Management Association probably cannot estimate its magnitude. Given the current state of Weishan Lake, how can it accommodate this endless water?</p>
<p>It should be known that Peixian is a vast plain, and its terrain is lower than that of other counties. There are no hills or ridges, so it is not easy to block the water. There is only allowing it to flood and flow horizontally, causing people to be submerged and houses to be ruined. It is a pity that more than one hundred thousand people living around the lake will lose their property, not to mention their lives. How can those who are responsible for protecting the lives of the people just send telegrams and not promptly and properly plan rescue measures?"</p>
<h3>The Situation in Chahar After Feng Yuxiang Went South</h3>
<p>Fang Sun and other troops stationed in Zhangbei outside the Kou area</p>
<p>Song will return to Chahar after the aftermath has been handled properly</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou News: Feng Yuxiang's resolute surrender of the military and political affairs of Chahar Province this time was indeed due to various difficulties and he had no choice. When the telegrams surrendering the military and political affairs were sent, Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, Sun Liangcheng, and others were not informed beforehand. Afterwards, they rushed back to Zhangjiakou from their defense areas to hold a meeting and expressed their opinions on Feng's actions without consultation. Feng said that he had other plans, wondering if he suspected them. Seeing Feng's firm attitude, Fang and others remained silent. Regarding the issue of Feng's residence, the central government advocated that he should be south of Zhangjiakou to avoid being surrounded. Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, and others strongly urged Feng to live in Zhangbei. After running around from various parties and the invitation of Han Fuqu, it was decided that he would reside in Mount Tai and lead a life of quiet cultivation in the deep mountains again. After Song Zheyuan arrived in Zhangyuan from Xuanhua to meet Feng, he made all preparations and decided to take his guard of more than a thousand people, accompanied by Song, to Ping, and then Han sent armored vehicles to escort them to Shandong. Feng left Zhangyuan and went south with Song Zheyuan, Tai Decun, Guo Zhihan, and others at 2 AM on the 14th. Thus, the Chahar incident came to an end, and now it has entered the aftermath period.</p>
<p>There are still sixty to seventy thousand troops under Feng and Fang, who have all retreated to Zhangbei, Kangbao, Baochang, Duolun, Guyuan, and other areas outside the Kou area. Fang Zhenwu and Sun Liangcheng are in Zhangbei, Zhang Renjie is in the villages west of Zhangbei, and Ji Hongchang is in Duolun. Fang and others have another organization in Zhangbei, and it seems that they have not yet been able to abandon everything. Liu Guitang has more than ten thousand troops, and the area he occupies extends from Guyuan directly to Chicheng Longguan, which is also a major issue in the aftermath of Chahar Province.</p>
<p>After Song returned to his post as the Chahar provincial government, all personnel from the Allied Forces era left their posts. The civil and financial departments were temporarily taken over by Qin Decun and Guo Zhihan, and the construction department was also temporarily taken over by Zhang Weifan. Zhang arrived in Zhang last night and went to the department this morning to take office. After Song went to Ping, the affairs of the provincial government were handled by Secretary-General Yang Zhennan and Zhang Weifan and others. Song's trip to Ping was partly to send Feng off and partly to discuss the aftermath of Chahar Province with He Yingqin. The Chahar situation has just been settled, and the clues are complicated. The aftermath is not easy. Song must discuss a proper solution in Ping before returning to Chahar, otherwise he will inevitably resign again. Song urged the current maintenance personnel of the provincial government to temporarily maintain the status quo, which is his intention is very clear.</p>
<p>Since Deng Wen was killed in a brothel in Zhangyuan, people have been panicking. Feng sent Zhang Renjie and Zhang Yunrong as martial law commanders and announced martial law on August 1. Every night at 9 PM, pedestrians were checked. The initial takeover of Song's troops was also quite tense. It has gradually settled down in recent days, but the military and police on the road are strict, which is not comparable to normal times. Song's troops are concentrated in Zhangyuan, and Xuanhua is taken over by Pang Bingxun's troops. Today (14th), a team of Pang's troops arrived in Zhangyuan. Pang will come to Zhang to organize a bandit suppression headquarters. The order in Zhangyuan has been maintained throughout, and no disturbances have occurred even during the large gathering of troops. However, the commercial depression has reached its extreme, and all industries feel decline. It is hoped that the political situation will be stable in the future and gradually recover.</p>
<p>Duolun is still in the hands of our army. The Japanese and puppet troops are actively invading the west, but have not launched a large-scale attack. The Zhang and Duolun telegrams have been out of communication since yesterday, but this is due to other reasons and has nothing to do with the overall situation. (August 14th)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Merchants Rectifying Business Tax Expressed Their Concerns</p>
<p>Director Zhan of the Jiangsu Third District Business Tax Bureau, under orders to rectify business tax, decided to send personnel to various stores starting from August 21st to investigate capital and turnover. The County Chamber of Commerce, fearing that this would cause disturbances, specially convened a general meeting of representatives of various industries yesterday (18th). 70 representatives from 54 industries attended the meeting, presided over by Shi Junqing. It was decided on the spot to send a letter to the Business Tax Bureau, requesting a postponement of the implementation. At the same time, Shen Shuzhang, Xu Juebo, Xue Yongling, and other eight people were appointed to go to the bureau for contact with Song Youpei and other standing committee members of the County Chamber of Commerce this morning (19th) to personally present the difficult situation of the business community and request flexible handling.</p>
<h3>Uncle Commits Bestiality, Raping His Niece</h3>
<p>Hu Shu, No. 18 Dongda Garden, Niujia Lane, East City, because of family poverty, worked as a servant and sent her daughter Xingbao (19 years old) to live with her brother-in-law Zhang Jinsheng. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 16th, Zhang's bestial nature broke out. While Xingbao was fast asleep, he forcibly raped her. The next morning, Xingbao immediately cried to her mother and reported to the police station with a pair of blood-stained pants as evidence. Zhang was detained and sent to the bureau. Yesterday (19th), he was transferred to the General Bureau. Zhang Jinsheng confessed that he did not admit to raping his niece, only that he was looking at the "Romance of the West Chamber" with her in bed that night and touched her abdomen with his hand, etc. According to the confession, the Public Security Bureau ruled that the court should be informed for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>An Anti-Japanese Warrior Attempted Suicide and Was Rescued</p>
<p>Zhang Haohun, 29, from Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, graduated from Nanyang Middle School. He has a wife named Yang Shufen, a son named Xingnong (6 years old), and four brothers. Haohun is the third oldest brother, named Guohun, Hanhun, and Jianhun. All four brothers joined the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army. Haohun belonged to the poison gas class of the military sergeant training team of the division. During the January 28 Incident, in the battle of Jiangwan Miaohang, the Zhang brothers captured the Japanese division flag. Later, they participated in the Zhang Huabang and other battles. Guohun, Hanhun, and Jianhun all died in battle one after another. Haohun was also shot four times. After medical treatment, he recovered. When the peace treaty was signed, Haohun was stationed in Fuzhou with the army. During an inspection, he clashed with Japanese rogues and traitors and was expelled from the division. A total of sixteen people were expelled. After being expelled, they led each other to the Northeast Volunteer Army to kill the enemy. Zhang Yan, the division commander, issued free travel passes for the journey. However, because they had no money, the sixteen people dispersed along the way, some drowned at sea, and some became monks at Mount Putuo. Haohun went to Wuxi after many twists and turns. He went to Huishan alone, wandering in the forests at the foot of the mountain, intending to pay homage to the grave of his younger brother Jianhun. However, there were many deserted tombs, and he did not know where his younger brother was buried. Touched by the scenery, he felt sad and had the idea of committing suicide. He wrote two suicide notes (one to Division Commander Zhang Yan and one to the elders, the original is very long, reaching several thousand words). Then, on the morning of the 17th, he bought one yuan of raw opium and secretly took it in the Mengshen Temple on Xishan. After taking it, he had just left the door when the poison took effect, and he fell to the ground, rolling straight down the mountain. This was seen by the monks of the temple, who immediately reported it to the police station of the fourth branch of the Public Security Bureau. The police and the head of the village, Jiang Zixian, sent him to Chen Tonghui's clinic for emergency treatment before he was out of danger. That night, Fan Xin, the director of the fourth branch, sent the police to accompany him to Dongyue Temple for recuperation. Yesterday, he was sent to the Brothers Hospital for medical treatment. He is conscious and no longer in serious condition. The reporter went to visit him. Haohun told the story, shedding tears of blood. Those who heard it sighed. The people of the county, because of his commendable ambition and pity for the hero's last days, generously donated money. In addition to bearing the medical expenses on behalf of the police station chief Fan, he also gave him ten yuan. Gu Hesheng, a local resident, also prepared eggs, biscuits, beef fruit, fresh orange water, cigarettes, and other gifts.</p>

<h3>Gao Yihan Inspects Changzhou</h3>
<p>Gao Yihan, a member of the Supervisory Yuan, was sent to inspect the administrative and judicial organs of various counties in Jiangsu Province. He arrived in Changzhou from Wuxi on the morning of the 18th. County Magistrate Cai, upon hearing the news, immediately led police captain Mao Gangsheng to the station to greet him. Committee Member Gao arrived in Changzhou at about 11 AM. The secretary Huang Renzhong came with him. Then, County Magistrate Cai accompanied him to the county government for lunch. In the afternoon, he went to the county court and prison to inspect a week, asking in great detail. At about 4 PM, he went to Tianning Temple in the eastern suburbs to visit. After having dinner in the temple, he took the 7 PM car back to Nanjing to report.</p>
<h3>Ji Chenzi Commits Suicide in Despair</h3>
<p>Ji Chenzi, who used to tell fortunes and tell fortunes in the Jinji Inn on Zhijie Street in Wuyi County, committed suicide because of poor business. At 6 o'clock on the 17th of this month, he went to the Jiaotong Inn in Qishuyan and stayed in room No. 5. In the evening, he drank wildly in a restaurant. When he returned to the inn, he went to sleep. The next morning at about 9 o'clock, the waiter knocked on the door because there was no sound in the room, but there was no response. He opened the door and saw Ji Chenzi lying on the bed, with his head and feet wrapped in white cloth, and his eyes closed. He had committed suicide. Three suicide notes were also found, mostly saying that he was committing suicide because he was in despair, lonely and alone, and did not want to burden the innkeeper. The inn reported to the County Court Procuratorate, which sent someone to investigate and determined that he had committed suicide by taking poison. The innkeeper prepared a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>The Navy's Water Police Encircled and Suppressed Pirates</h3>
<p>Recently, in the coastal area of Jiangbei, pirates have colluded with mutinous soldiers to carry out large-scale disturbances. The situation is extremely rampant. The provincial government ordered the various teams of the fourth district of the water police stationed in Tong Province to join the Navy's Tongji and other warships to encircle and suppress them. At the moment, the Huaihai Guerrilla Team has already captured more than ten pirates and, together with the captured weapons, escorted them to the Nantong District Headquarters. Zhu Songzhou, the captain of the mutinous maritime patrol team, was escorted from Shanghai to Tong. After the district chief Zhang Xianyi returned to defense and interrogated him, he will be escorted to the province.</p>
<h3>Commissioner Ye Goes to Qidong on a Mission</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been major disputes between the party and government in Qidong County. The provincial government ordered Ye Zhendong, the administrative inspector commissioner of the seventh district, to go to mediate. Ye left Tong for Qi on the morning of the 18th.</p>

<h3>Chief of Xu Dai Township Xu Dai Was Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The chief of Xu Dai Township, Dai Dingyuan, in the eighth district of the county office, lived in Daijiaxia Hebei. At about 9 PM the night before, when there was a rainstorm, more than ten bandits suddenly came, each holding a box gun, broke into the door, and kidnapped Chief Dai. When the defense regiment of the district heard the alarm and came to arrest them, the bandits had already fled without a trace. The regimental leader of the district, Bai, has reported to the county government, requesting strict arrest.</p>
<h3>The Police Team Arrested Bandits and Escorted Them to the County</h3>
<p>Captain Zhu of the county police team intercepted two bandit ships in Dongjiatan, the ninth district, and captured six kidnappers, including Sun Xichang. Five hostages, including Zhu Baotang, a rifle, and many bullets were found in the ship. They were all escorted to the county government for interrogation last night (16th).</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Using New Weights and Measures in the Grain Industry</h3>
<p>The county has implemented a new system of weights and measures, and various industries have been implemented in order. The grain industry was also notified by the county magistrate in the first district to comply within a time limit. Rice industry representatives Yin Baolun and others convened a meeting of colleagues in urban and rural areas to discuss. Due to different situations and differences between urban and rural areas, rice buyers and sellers are accustomed to using the original dou and hu as the standard. Once the measuring device is changed, but its value is not changed, the poor households of the common people will be affected first. Moreover, the counties of Su and Chang have not been able to implement it uniformly. If you want to standardize the implementation date, the county government must convene district heads from the whole county to discuss the method, so that the grain industry in the whole county will be sympathetic and use the new system, so as to avoid differences in time and make excuses. Yesterday, District Chief Liu presented it to the county for approval.</p>

<h3>茂盛豐 Pawnshop Opens for Redemption</h3>
<p>Maoshengfeng Pawnshop in Jiaxing Fengjie Bridge Town was robbed by bandits on the night of July 28th. The manager of the pawnshop, Xu Jingbo, requested the county government to send personnel for on-site inspection and to inventory the number of items robbed. County Commissioner Xu Zhaozhang went to jointly supervise the inventory and investigation with local institutional leaders. The investigation and inventory have now been completed and reported to the county. Furthermore, as the autumn season approaches and new grains are harvested, villagers are in urgent need of redeeming their clothing and belongings. The pawnshop has decided to release all un-robbed goods starting from the 20th and waive interest for one month from the date of the robbery. The county government has issued a notice to all pawnshop customers to comply.</p>
<h3>Security Team Repels Bandit Gang</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Second District, the county security team learned that bandit chieftain Zhao Zihou and his gang had continuously robbed the Mì, Zhū, and Lǐ villages and refused to leave. Upon receiving the report, the team dispatched more than fifty soldiers led by Squad Leaders Ma and Liu, who rushed to the scene overnight. This afternoon, they encountered the bandits in the area of Upper and Lower Harbors. After several hours of intense fighting with the bandits, numbering about forty to fifty, three bandits were killed on the spot, two guns were seized, and two hostages were rescued. The bandits fled northeast.</p>
<h3>Wolf Disaster in Western Dingyuan County</h3>
<p>In the aftermath of bandit robberies, a pack of wolves has suddenly appeared in the Nengren Temple area of western Dingyuan County, causing severe harm. They come out in packs at night, seeking people and livestock. In recent days, more than a dozen elderly and young people have been killed or injured by them. Every evening at dusk, the villages tightly close their doors, afraid to go outside.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Huang Fu Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Says 50 Million Needed for War Zone Relief</p>
<p>Post-War Handling Lies in Army Placement</p>
<p>Will Go to Mogan Mountain for Over a Week Before Returning to Beiping</p>
<p>Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee of the Executive Yuan stationed in Beiping, previously traveled from Beiping to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the situation in North China and request instructions on all matters. He returned to Nanjing the day before yesterday and took the Nanjing-Shanghai night express train to Shanghai that evening. Yesterday morning at 7:48 AM, he arrived at the Zhenru train station. According to Huang, his visit to Shanghai has no special mission. He plans to go to Mogan Mountain for a short rest in the next few days, and then return to Beiping to resume his duties in over ten days. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mayor Greets Him After Disembarking at Zhenru</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at Zhenru Station, those who welcomed him included Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Roads Bureau, Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Engineering Bureau, and Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau. Police officers from the Fourth District and the Third Precinct heavily guarded the station's surroundings. The train arrived at the station at 7:48 AM. After disembarking, Huang shook hands with the welcomers one by one and took a car back to his residence on Qizhai Road for rest. This reporter met Huang at the station, who said that this visit had no special mission and that he planned to go to Mogan Mountain for a short rest in the next few days before returning to Beiping. Accompanying Huang to Shanghai yesterday were Secretaries He and Wang, Ge Jingyou, and six guards. After arriving at his residence, Mayor Wu drove to Huang's residence at 9:30 AM to visit him, departing after a 20-minute conversation.</p>
<h3>War Zone Relief Is a Pressing Matter</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, Huang met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence. According to Huang, due to the impact of the war, political reorganization in North China is still difficult to discuss for the time being. The intensity of the war in North China has long been understood by the general public. There were more than 400,000 participating soldiers, eight times the scale of the Battle of Shanghai. The size of the war zone is also several times that of Shanghai. The Battle of Shanghai lasted only a little over a month, while the war in North China lasted for five months, so the losses are even greater than those in Shanghai. They are truly incalculable. The war zone refugees are displaced and their plight is unbearable. If relief is not provided soon, the future will be even more unimaginable. Therefore, providing war zone relief is currently a pressing matter. Moreover, even though the central government is under extreme financial strain, it was still able to allocate one million in cash and four million in public bonds to be used for war zone relief expenses. Although this is only a drop in the bucket, it is still extremely commendable. If we want to fully complete the relief effort, then less than fifty million will not do the trick. What we have now is just a quick relief effort, an initial relief effort. The entire plan still needs to be studied and negotiated.</p>
<h3>Post-War Handling in Chahar Province Has Two Key Points</h3>
<p>The Chahar issue has been superficially</p>
<p>resolved. Feng has left, and Song has also</p>
<p>been reinstated. However, there are still two</p>
<p>points remaining in the aftermath:</p>
<p>(1) Feng collected and incorporated a very large number of mixed troops in Zhangbei, who urgently need to be reorganized and disbanded. Orders have been issued for them to remain in their original defense areas awaiting orders.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese side is using Feng's destruction of the agreement as an excuse to reoccupy Dolon, which must be negotiated and returned. However, the situation is complex and there are still many difficulties. Whether or not Feng's side will be given a nominal title is not yet determined.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Three Locations in Eastern Luan Still Not Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Our side has gradually taken over</p>
<p>the various places in eastern Luan.</p>
<p>There are still three places where the</p>
<p>Japanese troops have not completely withdrawn. One is</p>
<p>Xinglong County, one is Dushan. Dushan is not a county seat, but a</p>
<p>special administrative bureau was established there. Half of the two places are</p>
<p>outside the Great Wall and half are inside the Great Wall. Now, those south of the Great Wall,</p>
<p>have already been taken over by us. A complete recovery,</p>
<p>must wait until the various passes of the Great Wall are resolved before discussing. One is Linyu County. After the outbreak of the war in North China, the documents and archives of the Linyu County Government were moved to Haiyang Town. The current county magistrate is still working in Haiyang Town. There are still Japanese troops in Linyu, and they will definitely be withdrawn in the short term.</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Puppet Army Is the Most Troublesome</h3>
<p>One point is more troublesome than</p>
<p>the Battle of Shanghai, which is the</p>
<p>manufacturing of more than 20,000 puppet troops by the Japanese in the eastern area.</p>
<p>When Shanghai was taken over, the Japanese army could retreat and we could take over. The only traitor was the powerless Hu Lifu. However, in North China there are Li Jichun, Li Shoushan, Shi Yousan, etc., all of whom must be dealt with properly before proceeding. Currently, Li Jichun's 12,000 troops have been reorganized and reduced to 4,000. Li Shoushan's 8,000 troops, who call themselves the East Asia Allied Army, have all been transferred outside the customs. Shi Yousan's troops currently only number about 700, and their discipline is still good. However, whether they will be disbanded or reorganized in the future is still undecided.</p>
<h3>Going to Mogan Mountain in a Day or Two</h3>
<p>Huang finally said that he went to Jiangxi to meet with</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the situation in North China</p>
<p>and request instructions on all matters.</p>
<p>When I went north, I expressed my willingness to sacrifice everything for the benefit of the country.</p>
<p>I have never considered merit or demerit. Therefore, any criticism from future generations</p>
<p>is not something I will take into account. This time I came to Shanghai for a short rest, and I plan to visit Mogan Mountain. The exact date is still not determined, but it will probably be in a day or two.</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Returns to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>To Attend Opening Ceremony of Shanghai Consulate</p>
<p>Will Begin Operations in Early Next Month</p>
<p>Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomoлов, previously went to Nanjing to meet with Foreign Minister Luo Wengan to discuss a non-aggression treaty, but no concrete results were achieved. Now that Foreign Minister Luo is about to inspect Xinjiang, Bogomolov also took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday and will attend the opening ceremony of the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai. The Soviet Consulate on the Bund has been renovated and will officially begin operations in early next month after the scheduled opening ceremony.</p>
<h3>Polish Chargé d'Affaires Weidenthal Appointed Minister to China</h3>
<p>Will Enter Nanjing on Schedule After Credentials Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hua Se'er, an attendant at the Polish Legation in Shanghai, told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who visited him that he said that the rumor in the European telegram that Chargé d'Affaires Weidenthal was appointed as the first Polish Minister to China has now been confirmed by an official telegram. Mr. Wei has not yet been able to decide when to enter Nanjing, because the Polish credentials have not yet arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Wei must wait for the credentials to arrive before he can determine the date to enter Nanjing. It is not yet known whether the credentials will be brought by Dr. Guo Laixinnesky, the counselor of the Polish Legation, who will arrive in Shanghai on the 27th or 28th of this month. However, he believes this is possible, otherwise, if they are mailed from Warsaw, it will take four or five weeks to reach Shanghai.</p>
<h3>French Concession Authorities Approve Anti-War Conference</h3>
<p>Malai Took Ship to Japan Yesterday</p>
<p>Will Come to Shanghai Before the 3rd to Preside</p>
<p>The Great America Evening News says that Lord Malai, Chairman of the World Anti-War Association, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (18th) and took the President Coolidge to Yokohama today (19th). He will consult with liberals from all over Japan, and then return to Shanghai before the 3rd of next month to preside over the meeting. The meeting place has been decided at the Chinese Christian Association in Eight Immortals Bridge and has been approved by the French Concession authorities. The meeting will last for three days, from September 3rd to 5th.</p>
<h3>Five-Cent Telephone Fee in the Concession Suspended Starting This Quarter</h3>
<p>Notice from Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Association, Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association, Paper Industry Association, Woolen Industry Association, Gold Industry Association, Coal Industry Association, Cotton Cloth Industry Association, Transportation Industry Association, Knitting Industry Association, Sugar Industry Association, Construction Factory Industry Association, Oil Pressing Factory Industry Association, Seafood Grocery Industry Association, Southern Goods Industry Association, Su Industry Association, Egg Industry Association, Electrical Appliance Industry Association, Western Clothing Industry Association, Mineral Ash Factory Industry Association, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association, Department Store Industry Association, Rental Car Industry Association, and more than a hundred other trade associations issued a joint notice yesterday regarding the suspension of the five-cent telephone fee charged by the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession each time. The notice stated: "It has been found that for telephones in this city, a five-cent fee is charged each time for calls between Chinese and foreign concessions solely due to the distinction between Chinese and foreign concessions, which violates the principles of public utilities and hinders the development of commerce. Now that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, after strong efforts by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations, has already cancelled this fee, while the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession still charges it as usual, which is obviously unreasonable. Therefore, we hereby jointly notify all shops in the city to stop paying the five-cent fee charged by the Shanghai Telephone Company for each Chinese-foreign telephone call starting from this quarter to show our determination. We hereby notify you to take note."</p>
<h3>Investigating National Salvation Donations</h3>
<p>Opinions of the "94-Year-Old Man"</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo's opinion on the investigation of national salvation donations is as follows: "Recently, several groups in Shanghai have been investigating the disposal of national salvation donations, and a National Salvation Investigation Association has been organized to carry out the investigation. Li Du also sent two letters from Lushan to Zhu Qinglan, questioning many points in a stern manner. This kind of responsible public accusation is still an innovation since the revolution. At the same time, the facts become clearer with debate, and justice is also judged with debate. However, if the accuser can maintain a serious and impartial attitude, base everything on facts, and not use accusations as a means to achieve certain goals, then the accused should be happy to accept it. However, I am ultimately afraid that this attack on Zhu Qinglan and the support association is close to deliberate embarrassment or contains other intentions, and fails to maintain a serious attitude. Moreover, the majority of Shanghai's long-established public groups are adopting a spectator attitude towards this huge wave, without any fair expression. The world is turbulent, there is no justice, no right and wrong, and black and white are confused. Justice is declining. I am even more heartbroken by this. I am old, and I have nothing to offend in the world, nor do I have anything to fight for. However, I am especially unwilling to remain silent on this kind of unfair phenomenon. Now, I will say a word: First, Zhu's just and honest personality has always been trusted by the people of the country. In the past, he presided over politics in Heilongjiang and Guangdong, and his political achievements were remarkable. The thoughts of the Sweet Pear Tree are still not fading. Even as he handled disaster relief two years ago, he painstakingly planned, without wasting a cent. His justice and honesty have been seen by the people of the country. At that time, overseas Chinese and domestic donors only needed a personal receipt from Zhu to deeply believe that the funds they donated would definitely be used properly</p>
<p>, and some did not hesitate to travel far and wide to personally hand over the donations to Zhu. The trust</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Local Association Telegraph the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Quickly Plan and Repair the Baoshan Seawall</h3>
<p>Concerns Billions of Lives</p>
<p>Urgent Need to Plan Repairs</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association believe that the dangerous works on the Baoshan Seawall are related to the lives of billions of people. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request a large-scale repair to protect the lives of the people. The original telegram stated: "To the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, we previously requested more than 200,000 in funds for emergency repairs to the Baoshan seawall. Subsequently, personnel were sent to investigate and survey, and only 40,000 yuan was estimated for repairs, which is a significant difference. Now, the Yellow River has overflowed into Jiangsu, which is already a fact. If it enters the river, the Baoshan's thin and dangerous seawall will probably not be able to withstand the impact of the confluence of the river and the sea. Even if we want to rush repairs at that time, it may be too late. This matter concerns billions of lives, and it is urgent to plan materials and carry out large-scale repairs in advance to avoid irreversible consequences. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Local Association respectfully kowtow."</p>
<p>in him is so great. How could this be accidental, or could it be 'faked' in a single day? This time, after the Northeast fell, he, in his twilight years, was moved by righteous indignation and mindful of the danger, did not hesitate to work hard, and made a desperate appeal to the people of the country, and spared no effort to help the righteous army. As a result, he was showered with complaints and accusations. If he must be made to bankrupt his reputation, is there really any right and wrong in the world? When a tree is taller than the forest, the wind will surely destroy it. Today's China does not tolerate good people. The world is like this, and are the hearts of the people really dead? Second, I hope that all those who attack Zhu can base their accusations on facts and submit the evidence to public judgment. Zhu should also express his welcome. However, in terms of facts, most of those who attack Zhu today are picking up rumors as a pretext, or claiming to have heard about it, or pretending to be rumors. For example, the claim of "20 million donations" has already been questioned by accountant Pan Xulun. Also, the claims that Zhu used 500,000 to open a school and a bank have also been proven to be false one by one. Up to now, many of the facts presented by the attackers cannot be established. However, the attackers' attacks are still the same, either ridiculing or sneering. If there is such a thing, it is also strange. Taking a step back, even if Zhu really has acts of corruption, the investigation association has now been established. If there is really concrete evidence of corruption, then the country has constant laws, and Zhu has his own deserved crimes. Wait until the facts are clear at this time, and no one can justify it. Then, the people of the country can rise up and abandon him together. Now that the investigation has not yet begun and the facts are not yet clear, the attackers are acting together. It is truly a matter of wanting to add a crime, not worrying about a pretext. It can be regarded as a predetermined plan. Third, I believe that those who handle anti-Japanese donations are not only Zhu and the support association, but also the government collects a lot. They should also be investigated equally to show impartiality. The donations handled by the government have also been announced. Before the results of the investigation are announced, no one should deliberately slander or falsely accuse Zhu and other handling groups. If there are any, they have other functions. Now that the great bandits are present and the national situation is precarious, the government says to resist Japan every day, and encourages the people to go to the national crisis together. However, the result of the people's donations to resist Japan is enough for people to use as a tool of attack, making those who are sincerely anti-Japanese unable to defend themselves, and making them laugh and cry. The Japanese who are high on the head of Shanhaiguan must clap their hands and laugh wildly, and the general people will completely chill their anti-Japanese emotions. After that, no one will ask about anything. The enemies are happy, and the relatives are in pain. Can we still ask about the future of anti-Japanese war? Can we still ask about the future of the country? The government is now calling for gathering the strength of the country. Talented people with virtue and hope are also the strength of the country. Today, Zhu is one of the most trustworthy people in our country. However, we must not tolerate him, and we must destroy him. This is truly something to cry and sigh about for a long time. If right and wrong have not been completely obliterated and justice has not been completely extinguished, then the social aspect should pay attention to this action of investigating anti-Japanese donations and make a public expression. There are many public groups with a long history in Shanghai, and there are also many fair and courageous people in the country. Please do not stand by. In short, right and wrong and justice are now only a thread of life. I now sincerely appeal to the people of the country to pay attention together and not let the light be completely swallowed by the darkness."</p>
<h3>Central Mint to Cast Two Types of Bullion Bars</h3>
<p>.999 and .880 Fineness</p>
<p>After the issuance of the new currency by the Central Mint, in accordance with the regulations on minting coins, it was decided to start minting .999 fineness bullion bars next week. As for the .880 fineness silver bars, the Review Committee has already submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, and minting will begin after approval. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Silver Bars Submitted to the Ministry for Approval. The Review Committee approved at the General Assembly on the 11th of this month that the Central Mint should re-mint the second type of bullion bar, namely silver bars, with a fineness of .880 per thousand, each bar worth 1,000 yuan, which is equal to the amount of pure silver contained in 1,000 yuan of silver currency. Yesterday, the Review Committee prepared a presentation to the Ministry of Finance, detailing the approval of the General Assembly, and requested the Ministry's approval. The Central Mint will begin minting after the Ministry approves.</p>
<p>New Currency and Bullion Bars Minted Together. Yesterday, reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from financial circles that the Central Mint will mint the first type of bullion bar and the second type of bullion bar, with finenesses of .999 and .880, respectively. The pure silver content is equal, and each type of bar is worth 1,000 yuan. Because the mint does not have refining equipment, it has been temporarily decided to melt the .999 fineness bullion bars into large bars and the .880 fineness bullion bars into ingots. Those who request the mint to mint on their behalf should pay a minting fee of 2.25% per bar in accordance with Article 12 of the Coinage Regulations. The mint has decided to mint new currency and bullion bars at the same time to facilitate circulation in the market.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Goods Movement Exhibition, organized by the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District, the National Goods Movement Committee, and the China National Products Manufacturers' Federation, has been actively underway since it was decided to open on September 9th at the Shanghai Market in Nanshi. Yesterday, in addition to submitting the event to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping, and hiring evaluation committee members, letters were also sent to various national goods organizations soliciting exhibits from various factories. To facilitate contact with all sectors, the office has now been rented at 160 Baker Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Submitting for Record-Keeping</h3>
<p>The document submitted by the association to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping yesterday stated: "Submitting for the record the holding of a national goods movement exhibition. We, the association, believe that using domestic goods is the urgent priority for saving the country, and publicity and promotion are the responsibilities of the people. We have convened a meeting to resolve to hold the Shanghai Municipal National Goods Movement Exhibition, which will last for three weeks, opening on September 9th. We have surveyed the Shanghai Market in Nanshi as the venue to collect exhibits from domestic goods factories for separate display, and also opened a temporary market for the convenience of the public to purchase at will. We believe that this move is not only beneficial to both production and sales, but also promotes prosperity in the market and revitalization of commerce, which benefits both parties. In addition to submitting to the (Municipal Party Department) (Social Affairs Bureau) for record-keeping, we hereby submit this document for record-keeping."</p>
<h3>Soliciting Exhibits</h3>
<p>For the purpose of soliciting the output of various national goods factories</p>
<p>for separate display and promotion,</p>
<p>the association sent separate letters yesterday to</p>
<p>the China National Goods Maintenance</p>
<p>Association, the Shanghai Citizens' Patriotic Goods</p>
<p>Promotion Committee, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, and the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, saying: "We are writing to inform you that promoting domestic goods is one of the seven movements of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. However, promoting use depends on promotion. With this in mind, our association resolved at the Eighth Representatives' Congress to hold the Shanghai Municipal National Goods Movement Exhibition, scheduled to open on September 9th and close on September 30th. We have already surveyed the Nanshi Shanghai Market as the venue to collect exhibits from domestic goods factories for separate display, and also opened a temporary market for the convenience of the public to purchase at will. We believe that this move is not only beneficial to both production and sales, but also promotes prosperity in the market and revitalization of commerce, which benefits both parties. We have always admired your association as a leader in the national goods sector, and we dare to send this letter to ask you to inform the factories of your association to participate enthusiastically and jointly support this grand event. The matter concerns the national salvation movement, and we hereby request your association to grant assistance."</p>
<h3>Employment of Assessors</h3>
<p>The standing committee members of the association, Wang Xiaolai, Hu Fengxiang, Chen Binghui, and others, anticipating a large number of factory products participating at the time, deemed it necessary to assess their quality to encourage improvement.

We have been selected as standing committee members of the Shanghai National Products Promotion Exhibition. Recognizing our limited talent and heavy responsibilities, we fear inadequacy. However, given the importance of promoting domestic goods, we must strive to overcome these difficulties. The various factory products to be displayed at the exhibition are diverse and comprehensive. However, our knowledge of raw material sources and manufacturing quality is limited. Therefore, we require the expertise of industry specialists to conduct assessments, categorizing products to provide encouragement. We have long admired your leadership in the national goods sector, your specialized knowledge, and your respected reputation nationwide. We hereby respectfully request you to serve as an assessor for our association. Given the future of domestic goods, we sincerely hope you will accept this position."</p>
<h3>Labor Representative Li Yongxiang Returns to Shanghai from the International Labor Conference</h3>

<h3>Kong Xianrong to Return to the Front Lines Soon</h3>
<p>Sends Letter to Relief Association Requesting Strict Supervision of Dependents</p>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Kong Xianrong, Deputy Commander of Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin's National Salvation Army in Jilin Province, expressed his gratitude for the continued support, care, and education provided by various groups and relief associations in Shanghai for his unit's dependents over the past few months. With the approach of the autumn harvest and the urgent need to reorganize the front lines, Kong plans to travel to Hong Kong this month for instructions before heading to the front. Regarding the dependents in Shanghai, he sent a letter to the Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees of Shanghai, requesting strict supervision. The original letter stated: "Greetings. We are deeply grateful for the exceptional consideration your esteemed association has shown in addressing the resettlement issue of our unit's dependents in Shanghai. Even after the conclusion of the resettlement of dependents from other units, you have continued to provide support, and the educational efforts remain active despite funding limitations. We have expressed our appreciation to various parties, appealing for assistance to provide long-term support. We hope our sincere intentions are understood. As I, Xianrong, am about to return to the front lines to fight for national salvation, I pledge to remain true to my original aspiration, placing life and death aside. My dependents are no longer a concern. My comrades also share this sentiment, without regard for their families. If there is an opportunity for any of the dependents to return to their hometowns, please consider providing funds to facilitate their return so they can seek alternative means of livelihood. For those who have no home to return to and cannot be allowed to become vagrants, we entrust all subsequent educational and management responsibilities to the personnel appointed by your esteemed association. Clearly defined regulations must be strictly observed without exception. It is our belief that the dependents of my comrades are survivors of war, accustomed to hardship, and not inclined towards indolence. We urge strict supervision to prevent any transgressions, allowing them to establish themselves independently. This will bring gratitude to the dependents and glory to your association, which is Xianrong's hope day and night. If, unfortunately, one or two ignorant dependents disregard education and violate regulations, they should be deemed to have abandoned themselves and excluded themselves. Your association should assess the situation and order their expulsion, treating them as ordinary refugees to avoid disrupting group education. Although we believe this will not happen, we must consider the possibility to prevent your esteemed association from showing undue leniency, which could burden the entire group. Therefore, we provide this clarification for your consideration. We sincerely implore you to do so. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees. Respectfully, Kong Xianrong."</p>

<h3>Shutdown of the Electrical Machinery Factory Nearing Completion</h3>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Train Administrative Personnel</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng Proposes a Motion to the Board of Directors</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, believing that the abolition of compradores is imperative but that there is a lack of specialized personnel to manage cabins and ensure cleanliness throughout the ships, and that the new system piloted on the Pu'an and Xinming vessels has not yet shown definitive results, has proposed to the Board of Directors that the company train administrative personnel and hire specialized Westerners to recruit and train students within the company to serve on various ships and implement the new system. The motion states, in brief: "Following the Ministry's order to abolish compradores on all vessels, we have first implemented this on the Pu'an and Xinming ships. However, the company's river and ocean vessels still operate under the comprador system. The department heads, operating on a contract basis, tend to focus on business operations, paying little attention to the various facilities and hygiene on board, causing dissatisfaction among passengers. The new river and ocean vessels purchased by the company with British Boxer Indemnity funds will arrive in Shanghai and begin operations next spring. These new ships should, of course, operate under the new system without compradores. However, China lacks specialized administrative personnel for shipping, which requires timely training to prepare them for service on various ships. The company should hire one or two specialized Western shipping administrators to recruit students within the company and teach them ship management skills to replace compradores." The Board of Directors has approved the motion, authorizing General Manager Liu to hire specialized Westerners to train personnel within the company.</p>

<h3>Wen Hongen's Brother-in-Law Li Suqi Detained</h3>
<p>Li Suqi, the younger cousin of Madam Li, the wife of Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, hailed from Jiangdu and was a talented young man, a rare gentleman in a corrupt world. After Wen rose to the position of the municipal public security bureau chief, Li was appointed as a clerk in the fingerprint section of the bureau's judicial (third) division. However, after assuming his duties, Li occasionally acted improperly and falsely claimed to outsiders that he held the rank of major general and was an important director of the public security bureau's third division. Outsiders, unaware of the truth, addressed him as Major General Li or Director Li, and Li tacitly accepted these titles. Director Wen had heard rumors but, considering Li's youth, did not investigate deeply. However, Li became even more arrogant and reckless. Recently, in a major case, evidence of fraudulent behavior was discovered and reported. Wen investigated and found that Li was indeed a major suspect. Yesterday, he ordered Li's detention and temporary confinement to the Third Squad headquarters of the police brigade, pending interrogation by the judicial division.</p>

<p>Qian Lihe, a local chauffeur residing at 345 Zhonghua Road in the Chinese area, was detained by the French Concession Police on April 29th and handed over to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution in connection with the Wei Tingrong kidnapping case. After numerous court hearings presided over by Judge Wang Gangxu, during which the convicted accomplices Tang Shiliang, Zhu Jingcheng, and Cai Weicai were brought in for questioning, the court declared the debate closed on August 12th and adjourned to announce the verdict. Yesterday was the scheduled date for the verdict. At 10:30 AM, Judge Wang arrived in the first criminal court and ordered Qian Lihe to be brought to the court. After a brief interrogation, due to remaining doubts in the case, the court ordered that the chauffeur employed by Wei Tingrong at the time of the kidnapping be brought in for questioning. The court then announced the cancellation of the closure of debate and the reopening of the debate, scheduling a further hearing for August 26th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Maritime Vessels Bound for Guangdong Evade Taxes on Smuggled Goods, Resulting in Heavy Fines</h3>
<p>Guangdong Customs is extremely strict in inspecting merchant vessels, confiscating any undeclared smuggled goods and imposing heavy fines on the vessels involved. Last month, a Shanghai bookstore had eighteen packages of books transported to Guangzhou by a crew member. Because the books were not listed on the manifest, they were confiscated, and a fine of 500 yuan was imposed. After repeated negotiations, the bookstore paid the taxes on the books, and the ship owner paid the fine. More recently, the Hai Shang vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was traveling to Guangzhou when passengers smuggled one item of rayon and one item of ginseng without listing them on the manifest, and the ship owner was unaware of this. Upon discovery by Guangzhou Customs, the goods were deemed to have been smuggled intentionally. In addition to confiscating the rayon and ginseng, Guangdong Customs imposed a fine of 2,170 yuan on the ship owner. The vessel would be detained and prevented from sailing unless the fine was paid. The ship owner has now negotiated with the passengers who smuggled the goods and demanded that they pay the fine.</p>
<h3>Appointment of Personnel to Railway Business Offices</h3>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Business Offices are scheduled to open on August 21st. The Railway Administration yesterday appointed Shen Zouting, a section member of the Car Department, as the manager of the offices, and Cheng Zhenyue, a section member of the Documentation Department, as the deputy manager. Cao Benheng, the deputy leader and ticket agent of the Shanghai North Station, and Ye Liangjun, a ticket agent, were transferred to the offices to handle ticketing matters. Zhou Xianyan and Kuang Yangong, section members of the Business Department, were transferred to the offices to handle inquiries. Lou Buqing, the assistant leader of the baggage handlers at the Shanghai North Station, and Zhou Sihou and Wang Shifang, baggage handlers, were transferred to the offices to handle checked baggage matters.</p>
<h3>Watch Industry Advocates National Products</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Watch Industry Association sent a letter to the China National Products Company, introducing the products of the Shiyun Clock Factory. The letter stated: "Since the January 28th Incident, the Chinese people have realized that promoting national products is more effective than simply boycotting foreign goods. Watches are imported products, and all businesses in this industry are engaged in sales. The Shanghai Watch Industry Association recognized this early on and strongly advocated that its members establish their own factories. In addition to the Shanghai, Changming, and Dean factories established earlier, Mr. Xu Shimin recently founded the Shiyun Clock Factory. Its clocks are all modeled after German designs and are praised by all watch stores. The factory intends to have its products promoted by the China National Products Company, which is a pioneer in promoting national products, but lacks national product certification to dispel the company's doubts. The factory has requested the Watch Industry Association to provide certification and introduction. We have learned that the association has granted its permission and will send a letter to the company. The following is an excerpt from the association's letter to the China National Products Company: 'Greetings. According to a letter from our member Shiyun Clock Factory Co., Ltd., our factory manufactures various clocks. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to inspect our factory, and the association has also sent personnel to investigate. Both have recognized our products as national products. However, the China National Products Company is skeptical of our factory's products and refuses to promote them. We are writing to the company to provide certification and introduction to dispel its doubts and facilitate promotion. The future of national products depends on this.' Accordingly, our country's watch industry has traditionally been engaged in sales. Since the January 28th Incident, the Chinese people have realized that the way to save the country lies in promoting national products, not just boycotting foreign goods. The association has adhered to this principle and encouraged its members to establish their own factories. For clocks, in addition to the Yongye and Deyuanxing factories that make table clocks, Shanghai also has the Shanghai, Changming, and Dean factories. Their products are of excellent quality and have long been sold throughout the country, well-known to users and requiring no further explanation. Recently, the Shiyun Clock Factory was established in Renchang Lane on Wupu Road in Yangshupu. Its Chinese technicians manufacture German-style clocks. When the factory requested to join the association, we sent personnel to investigate. We found that the factory uses domestic materials except for the mainspring, which is sourced from Germany. As for the finished products, we have also conducted a detailed study and found that the parts are sturdy, the construction is excellent, and the timekeeping accuracy is even better than German clocks. We should therefore allow it to join the association as a member. Now, the factory says that your company seems to be skeptical of its products and refuses to promote them. We are writing to provide evidence of our investigation to your esteemed company. We hope you will review this matter.'"</p>

<h3>Solar Eclipse Tomorrow</h3>
<p>One-Third of the Sun Visible in Shanghai</p>
<p>Time: 1:10 PM</p>
<p>According to the Xujiahui Observatory, there will be a solar eclipse tomorrow (21st) afternoon. In Guangzhou, approximately one-half of the sun will be eclipsed. In Shanghai, only one-third of the sun will be eclipsed. According to Father Fei, director of the Sheshan Observatory, the solar eclipse will be visible in Asia during daylight hours. The total eclipse area extends east from Alexandria, Egypt, and includes Jerusalem, Delhi, Calcutta, Yangon, and Borneo. China is located north of this area, so the visible area of the solar eclipse is larger in the south and smaller in the north. In Guangzhou, one-half of the sun will be eclipsed; in Nanjing, one-third; and in Beijing, it will not be visible. The solar eclipse will begin at 10:52 AM and end at 4:45 PM. The peak eclipse will be at 1:48:08 PM. However, since only one-third of the sun will be visible in the vicinity of Shanghai, the solar eclipse will not be visible until 1:10 PM, and the eclipse will end at 2:50 PM.</p>
<h3>Theft of Ancient Paintings and Han Jade from the Home of Lin Erqing</h3>
<p>Perpetrator is the Former Cook</p>
<p>Stolen Goods Recovered Same Day</p>
<p>The home of Mr. Lin Erqing, manager of the Minghua Bank, a Ningbo native residing at No. 38 Dalu Fang, at the intersection of Rue Lubin and Route Chevalier in the French Concession, previously employed a fellow townsman named Han Renxun as a cook. Han was dismissed six months ago due to his misconduct. After losing his job, Han resided at No. 13 Annakin Road. Recently, due to financial difficulties, he conceived a plan to steal. At 3:00 AM on the 18th of this month, he climbed over the low wall of Mr. Lin's residence, broke the study's glass window, and entered. He stole seven ancient paintings and landscapes by famous artists such as Jiulong Shanren, Wang Shigu, Wen Zhengming, and Dong Qichang, valued at six or seven thousand yuan, as well as six albums, ten hand scrolls, eighty pieces of Han jade of various sizes, and clothing. He carried the stolen goods back to his home, first pawning the clothing. He hid all the antiques and paintings in his home, intending to find customers to sell them. The victim discovered the theft the next morning and reported it to the police. In the afternoon, detectives Li Liansheng and Bao Li Ticheng from the French Concession Police learned of the crime. At 5:00 PM, they arrested Han, recovered all the stolen goods, and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police attorney Fei Xizhen presented the case, stating that the police still needed to investigate whether the defendant had committed other crimes and requested a postponement for further investigation. Judge Wang Gangxu approved the request after questioning the defendant and ordered a postponement for further investigation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Family Tragedy: Younger Brother Kills Elder Brother</h3>
<p>Three Serious Wounds Inflicted by Knife</p>
<p>A Major Disaster Stemming from a Petty Dispute</p>
<p>Qiu Pinfu, a 22-year-old native of Haimen, residing at No. 63 Dongtiyu Road, Jiangwan Road, worked as a laborer in a leather factory on the same road. Recently, his elder brother, Pin Cai, discovered his gambling habit and questioned him about it during dinner on the 16th of this month. Pinfu refused to comply, leading to a quarrel and subsequent physical assault. Their cousin, Qiu Sibao, intervened to mediate and quell the situation. However, Pinfu harbored resentment and developed malicious intent. He secretly took a sharp leather-cutting knife used in the factory, sharpened it, and hid it under his bed. At 6:35 AM the next morning, he waited near the Jiangwan Road swimming pool. When Pin Cai left home and passed by the area, Pinfu approached him, provoked a quarrel, and they engaged in a physical fight. As a result, Pin Cai was stabbed in the neck and fell to the ground. Seeing the enormity of his crime, Pinfu abandoned the knife and attempted to flee. However, Chinese detective Tan Jinhai arrived after being alerted, arrested him, and took him along with the murder weapon to the Desiwei Road police station. The police chief ordered his detention. The injured Pin Cai was transported to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the events, stating that according to the doctor's examination, the victim, Qiu Pin Cai, sustained three severe knife wounds to the neck and was unable to testify. The police are temporarily charging the defendant with homicide under Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Criminal Code and requesting his detention. The murder weapon and the sweat-soaked shirt he wore during the crime (stained with blood) were presented as evidence. A request was also made to postpone the case. Furthermore, his father, Qiu Qiming, testified that his two sons had argued the day before during dinner when he was not present. He heard that the quarrel started over gambling, and the elder son, Pin Cai, angrily said that he wanted to beat the younger son to death. Unexpectedly, the younger son, Pinfu (the defendant), took this seriously and committed the crime first, leading to this disaster. Qiu Sibao also testified that the defendant was his cousin, and he lived in the same house with them. The day before, the defendant had a quarrel and fight with his brother, Pin Cai, which he had mediated. He did not know what the argument was about and was still asleep when the crime was committed, so he did not witness it. When questioned, Qiu Pinfu confessed that his brother had previously reprimanded him for gambling, but he also had the same vice, so he refused to accept it and quarreled with him. After the physical fight, his brother threatened to kill him. He claimed he used the knife for self-defense. Yesterday morning, another argument broke out on the road, and his brother punched him in the waist three times, so he used the knife to parry, accidentally injuring his ear. His remaining testimony was evasive. Judge Xiao Xie-fen ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing until the victim had recovered from his injuries and could be further questioned.</p>
<h3>Niu Jinpu, Wanted for the Assassination of Song, Escapes; Squad Leader to be Handed Over to Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Must Send Personnel to the Public Security Bureau for Inspection</p>
<p>Niu Jinpu, a key suspect in the attempted assassination of Finance Minister Song Ziwen last year and the death of Song's secretary, Tang Yulu, escaped from the toilet at midnight on the 15th of this month by falsely claiming he needed to defecate and sawing through his shackles. Details of the escape have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wen Hong'en, has ordered all district stations to apprehend the fugitive and bring him to justice. Furthermore, Meng Xianqi, the captain of the Third Squad of the Police Corps of the Bureau, along with squad leader Tang Zhidong and night watchmen Cao Zhenduo and Han Guilin, have been dismissed from their posts and handed over to the Third Section for interrogation. The Bureau has also submitted a report on the incident to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters of the Municipal Government for record. Mayor Wu and others have separately forwarded the report to the Executive Yuan and the General Headquarters for instructions. However, the Municipal Government must send personnel to the Public Security Bureau for on-site investigation. Therefore, the Third Section of the Bureau intends to hand over the detained Captain Meng and the other three men to the court for legal proceedings after the Municipal Government has clarified the case and completed the interrogation procedures.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Urges Silver and Money Industries to Implement New Weights and Measures System</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau issued an order yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, instructing the silver and money industries to implement the new weights and measures system. The original order is recorded below:</p>
<p>Order to Comply with Regulations:</p>
<p>Based on Municipal Government Instruction No. 6452, approving the request from the Ministry of Industry to strictly order the jewelry industry to adopt the new weights and measures system by a specified date, you are hereby ordered to comply and report accordingly. Upon investigation, this Bureau previously received a response from the local jewelry industry association stating that they must wait for the silver and money industries to adopt the new system before they can comply. After being ordered by this Bureau to convene relevant industries and discuss the implementation plan in detail, they reported that the banking industry had proposed to invite the money industry to jointly review the plan. In light of the previous order, in addition to submitting a report, you are hereby ordered to promptly urge the silver and money industries to quickly agree on a plan and adopt the new system by a specified date to facilitate progress. You must also report the compliance status for verification and transfer. Strictly adhere to this order.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already forwarded a letter to the silver and money industries associations for discussion and implementation.</p>
<h3>Three Batches of Exhibits for the Chicago Expo Shipped to America</h3>

<h3>Du Yuesheng Mediates in the Gao Yatou Tragedy: Continued Inquiry</h3>
<p>There is Hope for a Peaceful Resolution</p>
<p>Gao Yatou, a barber's apprentice, was kicked to death by Western police officer No. 39 of the French Concession Police on May 7th in the Qianjiatang area south of Avenue d'Albert. This incident aroused the public anger of the barber industry. A tragedy committee was formed to handle the negotiations, but after more than three months, a satisfactory resolution has not been achieved. Subsequently, the industry publicly elected representatives Luo Shantao and Qian Shuling, who, along with Gao's father, Yuanlin, repeatedly asked Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, to mediate. Mr. Du agreed to mediate to prevent the situation from escalating and causing disputes. However, the one-month period agreed upon by Mr. Du has expired. Gao's father, Gao Yuanlin, came to Shanghai from his hometown the day before yesterday. Therefore, yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, the industry association received a reply letter from Mr. Du. The association specially dispatched representatives Xue Guangdian, Wan Guoyi, Qian Shuling, Luo Shantao (represented by Guan Zhihe), along with the owner of the Hu Shun Yuan Tang barber shop and Gao's father, Gao Yuanlin, to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association. Under the leadership of Committee Member Tong Lizhang, they went to Mr. Du's residence on Avenue Foch to discuss everything in person. Mr. Du personally met with them and discussed the method of mediating the Gao case. A solution has been reached, but because it concerns the public opinion of the entire industry, the solution cannot be announced immediately. It must be approved by the committee before it can be fully resolved. However, the representatives expressed their gratitude to Mr. Du for his enthusiasm for public welfare and for mediating the case. After the discussion at Mr. Du's residence, everyone dispersed happily. It is reported that the Barber Industry Vindication Committee for the Gao Tragedy is scheduled to convene a full committee meeting at 10:00 AM next Monday, and the case can only be fully resolved after public recognition and resolution. Therefore, the date of the resolution is next Monday (tomorrow).</p>
<h3>A Prelude to Establishing Tungsten and Copper Smelting Plants</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Xiangpu, General Manager of the Shanghai Light Bulb Company in this city, believes that although most of the raw materials for making light bulbs are domestic products, the two items of filament (tungsten wire) and connection wire (copper wire) still rely on foreign imports, resulting in wealth outflow. After investigation,</p>
<h3>National Economic Commission's Engineering Department Concludes Flood Control at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Personnel Have Been Dispatched to Investigate the Yellow River Flood</p>
<p>The Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission is scheduled to conclude its work on the Yangtze River flood control at the end of this month. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate the Yellow River breach. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Flood Control Ends at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Between June and July of this year,</p>
<p>the Yangtze River water level rose sharply, creating dangerous situations and nearly causing a major disaster. At the beginning of the flood, the department ordered its subordinate Jianghan and Jiangxi Engineering Bureaus to strictly implement flood control. Director Xi De-kun also personally went to supervise and ensure the implementation of rescue measures. Fortunately, the rescue was effective, and no major disaster occurred. It is now known that the department has scheduled to complete the flood control project by the end of this month, as the flood season has passed and the river water is gradually receding. From September onwards, daily water levels will no longer be reported.</p>
<h3>Investigating the Yellow River Flood</h3>
<p>In recent days, the Yellow River region</p>
<p>has reported another flood, with</p>
<p>many breaches in various places.</p>
<p>The Yellow River basin has become a disaster area. However, the department has less responsibility for the Yellow River, with only an engineering bureau set up in the Mengjin section of Henan. The rest is not within its scope. Therefore, the flood control project is the responsibility of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. However, to understand the truth, the director of the Anhui-Huaihe Engineering Bureau, Wang Huzhen, has been dispatched to the downstream area of eastern Henan, and engineer Wu Shilin has been dispatched to the upstream area for investigation. However, no report has been received to date.</p>
<p>The filament used to manufacture light bulbs is made of tungsten and copper, known as tungsten wire and copper wire. China's Guangdong, Hunan, and other provinces have vast mineral deposits. However, because there are no domestic factories to smelt them, they are sold to foreigners as raw materials. After they are smelted into finished products, they are sold back to China. In this transfer, they enjoy the profits, while our wealth outflow increases daily. Mr. Sun, witnessing this drawback, is deeply concerned. Therefore, he contacted various mine owners to supply these minerals. He built new factory buildings on the remaining land of the company, purchased smelting machinery, and smelted various tungsten and copper wires, or drew other fine metal wires, hoping to make up for the deficiencies, recover a portion of the national interests, and increase the welfare of the people. According to Mr. Sun, after manufacturing begins in the future, in addition to supplying various light bulb factories, it will be good news for the industry.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Appeal for Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, rickshaw pullers in this city have appealed to Party and government agencies for a rent reduction due to the soaring rental fees for vehicles in the concessions. The case has been pending for four years and has not been resolved. Rickshaw puller representative Meng Jinchen and others have jointly issued a declaration, appealing to all sectors for assistance (details omitted above). Jinchen and others have been weeping and pleading for the people for four years without achieving their goals. Their weeping and pleading under the clear blue sky are not as effective as crying bamboo in the winter bamboo forest. Jinchen and others plead with all sectors for assistance to save the suffering coolie workers in the city from the oppression of unscrupulous merchants and demand eight articles of liberation: (1) The 2,666,600 yuan extorted by vehicle merchants over five and a half years should be recovered and contributed to national military needs or to establish factories to save unemployed workers and to abolish the special zone office. (2) The foreign merchants' vehicles, now expired, totaling 2,072 vehicles, should be recovered by the government for management and reorganized into labor vehicles. The rent should be reduced by 65 cents. According to the articles of association of the Shanghai Rickshaw Merchants Association, millions of yuan of rent should be settled annually and used by the country to establish factories to save coolies. (3) The uniform number should be written on the uniform, the same as the tax certificate. The white cover should be changed daily. (4) Copper coins must be at market prices; otherwise, they will not recognize the high corner prices. Vehicle repairs should be done immediately, and repairs should not be refused after 8:00 PM. (5) There must be freedom in wind, rain, cold, and heat; otherwise, forced rickshaw pulling after sending vehicles to the door is forbidden. The rent should be negotiated. (6) All vehicles must be equipped with double lamps, otherwise, rickshaw pullers must provide their own lamp oil and strictly abide by the regulations of the Public Works Department. (7) The right to inspect and donate should be recovered and should belong to the Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Bureau. (8) They demand severe punishment for the crime of contempt for the law and erosion by certain individuals and impeachment of all vehicle merchants. Compatriots should unite and demand a rent reduction, refuse to be manipulated and monopolized, and refuse to be oppressed and abused. They demand that they defeat the traitorous labor bosses and oppose the unscrupulous merchants and demons. Millions of people should unite, sacrifice, and fight to the end. They vow to never give up until the rent reduction goal is achieved.</p>
<h3>Strict Inspection of Vehicle Licenses in the Area of Cross-Boundary Roads</h3>
<p>Various vehicles traveling on Rue Route de Zikawei, Route Tenant de la Tour, Connaught Road, Avenue du President Haig, Yu Yuan Road, and other roads in the six districts of western Shanghai have not been required to pay for licenses due to the cross-boundary road relationship. Recently, the market has become increasingly prosperous, and the number of various vehicles has increased daily. Therefore, the Public Utility Bureau ordered the rickshaws to be inspected and licensed at the beginning of this year. Now, Director Tan of the Six Districts has found that there are many small cars and bicycles in the city that have not been licensed. Therefore, he issued an order to the police stations under his jurisdiction to strictly inspect them, starting from the day before yesterday. Those without licenses will be detained and ordered to obtain licenses before they can operate.</p>
<h3>Enamel Industry Association Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Shanghai Metal Enamel Industry Association reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau that someone not in the industry was privately making hat badges and other items, hindering their business. The Bureau arrested Mr. Zhu and others and handed them over to the court. Yesterday was the date for the court hearing. The judge, considering the matter to be minor, strongly urged a settlement. Mr. Zhu and others signed a confession in court, stating that they would not privately produce these items without the permission of the association in the future. Therefore, Mr. Dong Yuqing and other representatives of the association were satisfied, and the matter was peacefully resolved.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results Achieved in Cotton Production in the City's Agricultural Cooperation Experiment</h3>
<p>The city's agricultural cooperation experiment area has 15 districts, totaling more than 110 locations. Each location has a designated area of five acres. The cultivation methods, management guidance, and organizational content have been reported previously. The cotton crops in each cooperative experiment area are currently in the flowering and boll-setting period. According to the reports from the supervisors in each district, the cotton plants in each district have flowers and bolls all over them. The maximum number of flowers and bolls on each plant can be 30 to 40. If the weather does not change significantly recently, the production results are guaranteed. It is also planned to hold a joint exhibition during the slack season after the cotton harvest to promote and popularize it. They are now actively producing specimens related to cotton production.</p>
<h3>An Epidemic Eye Disease Discovered in Xinfeng; Xinwei Relief Society Purchases Medicine for Relief</h3>
<p>Wang Yiting, a standing director of the Xinwei Relief Society, received a joint letter yesterday from gentry and merchants in Xinfeng Town, Jiangsu. The original text of the letter stated that a strange disease has recently been discovered in the area. Initially, there is pain in the eyes, and if medical treatment is not sought urgently, both eyes will become blind within a few days. The total number of patients is more than 70. They request ways to provide relief. It is reported that the society has purchased a large quantity of eye drops and is trying to transport them for relief.</p>
<h3>Accountant Shen Liren Advocates Holding Accounting Academic Examinations</h3>
<p>He Wrote to the Accountants Association with a Proposal Yesterday</p>
<p>Accountant Shen Liren, considering that many talented accounting personnel who have obtained considerable accounting knowledge through diligent self-study are not trusted by society due to the lack of academic credentials, resulting in discouragement, which is unfortunate, while those with diplomas are often of mixed quality. There are many well-learned people, but also many who are merely superficial and lack practical knowledge. These people only know the basics of accounting and make many mistakes when serving society. Society is unaware and often develops a disdainful attitude, thinking that modern accounting is nothing more than that. If this mentality is not corrected as soon as possible, it will have a significant impact on the future of the accounting profession. Therefore, he wrote to the Shanghai Accountants Association yesterday, proposing that the association hold an accounting academic examination so that those with true knowledge can have proof, and those who hire accounting personnel can have a standard. His intention is excellent. His original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>I believe that since the establishment of our Accountants Association, it has been many years, but its reputation is not prominent and it has received little attention from the general public. Compared with the authoritative and influential Accountants Associations in advanced European and American countries, the difference is significant. After tracing the cause, the lack of service to the community by our Association is the main reason. Taking the accounting academic examination as an example, the Accountants Associations in advanced countries often have this initiative, while our Association has not yet held one (although the organizations of the Associations in various countries are different, but the group of accounting scholars is the same). Many accounting scholars with a certain level of knowledge but without qualifications are often not trusted by society due to the lack of proof, and their knowledge is not used, making their careers difficult, eventually leading to discouragement and abandonment to study other subjects, while those with school diplomas, many are well-learned, but there are also those who are merely superficial and lack practical knowledge. These people only know the basics of accounting and often find it difficult to be competent and make many mistakes when they are put into practice, causing the general public to have doubts about double-entry bookkeeping and accounting, losing their trust. This situation can be seen everywhere, and its impact on the future of the accounting profession is profound and significant. Liren believes that if our Association can follow the precedent of advanced countries and hold an accounting academic examination, without limiting qualifications, gender, or age, all Chinese citizens who believe that they have considerable accounting knowledge can take the test, and the only standard for selection is knowledge. The examination questions should be limited to the scope of accounting and not involve other examinations. Those who pass will be given a certificate by the Association to prove that they have considerable accounting knowledge. In this way, those with true knowledge will have credentials, and the general public will have a standard for the selection of accounting personnel. The Association will thus invisibly create a position recognized by the community as the highest accounting academic institution in China, and its reputation and strength will increase accordingly. The future of the accounting profession will also have rapid development. It is a matter of great benefit and the current key plan for our Association. Therefore, I specially write to propose whether it is appropriate, and I hope that it will be approved.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shen Liren, Member of the Shanghai Accountants Association</p>

<h3>Jiangyin Street Vendor Representatives Petition the Municipal Government Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Writes to the Mayor Requesting Protection for the Vendors</p>
<p>Mayor Meets with Representatives and Asks to Renovate the City's Buildings</p>
<p>The Charity Group's plan to build a market on South Railway Station Road to move the Jiangyin Street market there has caused panic among all the vendors on Jiangyin Street. They have repeatedly petitioned Party and government agencies and petitioned the Municipal Government twice to withdraw the order. The Municipal Government has not yet approved or rejected the petition. However, the Charity Group suddenly started construction the day before yesterday, arranging Sanhe soil, causing the vendors to be even more uneasy. They specially elected Yan Hongxiang, Fan Gongliang, and others as representatives to request the assistance of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a counselor of the Shanghai Municipal Government and president of the Ningbo Fellow Association. After the two representatives, Yan and Fan, visited Mr. Yu at the Sanbei Company to make a request, Mr. Yu personally agreed to sign and seal a letter to Mayor Wu, stating the vendors' plight on their behalf and requesting compassion for their difficulties and protection for them. The letter was handed over to the two representatives to present to Mayor Wu. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the vendor representatives Du Jinbao, Yan Hongxiang, Yu Miaofa, Fan Gongliang, and Xu Chunhua carried a petition and Mr. Yu's letter and took a car to the Municipal Government to petition again. Mayor Wu met with them. Yan Hongxiang and Du Jinbao stated the actual difficulties and requested the withdrawal of the order to maintain the livelihood of more than 5,000 people. They also proposed renovating the city's buildings in the South Railway Station Road market area so that both parties could benefit. They also presented Mr. Yu's letter. After Mayor Wu heard their presentation, he instructed them to wait for a proper reply. The representatives then left and visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing at the Sanbei Company to report on the petition process and ask Mr. Yu to meet with Mayor Wu again to withdraw the order. However, Mr. Yu was scheduled to go to Ningbo today to preside over the opening ceremony of the Yinzhen Charity Road, so he had to leave for Ningbo today (yesterday). Therefore, he instructed them to wait for his return to Shanghai to meet with the mayor to stop the construction and withdraw the order.</p>
<h3>Sixth Team of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps Adds More Members</h3>
<p>The Sixth Team of the Shanghai South District Defense Corps will add 50 volunteer members to supplement the team. Those who are of good character, physically strong, between 18 and 35 years old, have a proper occupation, and have a solvent guarantor who is willing to serve the community can register at the Sixth Team at Huoshenmiao Street, Dadongmen, from August 21st to the 30th. After passing the examination, they will be enlisted into the team.</p>
<h3>Engineering and Accounting Jointly Execute Business</h3>
<p>Electrical engineering expert Shen Sifang, former Chinese representative to the Second World Power Conference and electrical industry technician, and Yu Huairen, former director of the Hangzhou branch of the Lixin Accounting Firm, have jointly established an office at 212 Nanjing Road, upstairs of the China Industrial Bank, named the China United Engineering and Accounting Firm. It aims to improve China's production business. It has now begun operations and will officially begin executing business on the 23rd of this month. China's industrial and commercial enterprises are in decline, but the organization of such technical institutions can assist the financial community in solidifying loans and enable industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain guidance from engineering and accounting experts at a low cost. It can be said that it is doing its best in cooperative undertakings. It is reported that this type of organization is a pioneering initiative in China.</p>
<h3>Sun Zhan Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Whether Sun Is a Military Officer Is Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Sun Zhan, a counselor of the Military Affairs Commission, previously organized the Jicheng Company with Yu Xuefan and others to undertake the business of transporting and selling nitrate and sulfur in Jiangsu Province. Sun served as the chairman of the company, and Yu served as the manager. In 1930, Sun and others persuaded their friend Mo Fengshan to join Jicheng as a shareholder, investing 5,000 yuan and holding shares officially signed and sealed by the chairman and directors of the company. However, in 1931, Sun and Yu suddenly closed the company. Mo Fengshan only learned of this later because he had not been consulted on the company's operations since the investment, and Sun and others did not report the profit and loss accounts. Therefore, he negotiated, requesting the return of the principal, but in the end, he received nothing. Recently, he specially hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Sun and Yu in the First Special District Local Court, stating that the defendants' actions constituted the crime of embezzlement under Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code and should be punished according to the law. In addition, he filed a civil lawsuit, requesting the court to order the two defendants to jointly compensate him for 5,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Su Xie-fen of the First Special Court opened a hearing. The first defendant, Sun Zhan, also hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that Sun is currently a counselor of the Military Affairs Commission, belonging to the military profession. All active military personnel are not subject to the jurisdiction of ordinary judicial authorities and should not be accepted. Moreover, many of the plaintiff's accusations are untrue. Therefore, Sun also filed a counterclaim against Mo Fengshan for false accusation. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately stood up and stated the case. The court believed that it was necessary to investigate whether Sun Zhan was a current military officer with the Military Affairs Commission and adjourned the hearing to a later date to be verified.</p>

<h3>News of Salvaging Sunken Ships of Taikoo</h3>
<p>Wanliu Escapes Danger, Anqing Dismantles Machinery</p>
<h3>Wanliu Sunken Ship Rescued</h3>
<p>Taikoo Company's Yangtze</p>
<p>River Upstream Steamer Wanliu,</p>
<p>with a displacement of</p>
<p>1,060 tons, is one of the four major giant ships sailing on the Sichuan River. In the spring of this year, the ship struck a reef upstream of Yichang when resuming sailing during the rising water. At that time, due to the rupture of the bottom of the ship and the reef trapping in, it sank. The company suffered a great loss. This matter has been recorded in this newspaper. Since then, the company has repeatedly carried out salvage operations, but they have always been difficult to proceed due to the shallow water. Since the large flood occurred on the upper Yangtze River last month, the Taikoo Company sent workers and technicians to the site of the Wanliu ship accident to remove the reefs at the bottom of the ship first, and then repair the holes. After a long period of salvage work and filling the various cabins, pumping out the accumulated water, etc., it has finally been successfully completed. The Wanliu ship, which had struck a reef and sunk, has been rescued and has been dispatched to Chongqing for berthing, preparing to come to Shanghai for major repairs. However, in recent days, the Jiangshui area in Fuzhou in the upper reaches of the river has fallen sharply, and there are many hidden reefs along the way. The Wanliu ship's hull and draft are larger, and it is afraid to drag it back to Shanghai, deeply concerned that there will be another accident along the way. It is now planned that the river water will rise slightly, and it is planned to tow it back to Shanghai immediately. It is found that the ship's hull is excellent and costs more than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dismantling of the Anqing Steamer</h3>
<p>On the 25th of last month,</p>
<p>the Taikoo Yangtze steamer "Anqing," which ran aground at</p>
<p>Qingshantou Xiazuigou near Jiujiang,</p>
<p>failed to be salvaged after three weeks of rescue efforts. Recently, after the water receded, the "Anqing's" hull was left high and dry in the reed fields by the riverbank, making it even more difficult to drag and rescue. Taikoo Company initially planned to excavate the riverbank, drain water into the bottom of the ship, and then drag it away, but this would cost thirty to forty thousand taels of silver, which was not cost-effective. As a result of discussions, the company specially dispatched more than thirty workers and many mechanics from this port, ordering them to</p>
<p>completely dismantle the machinery, engines, and other items inside the "Anqing" steamer. Another large iron barge was dispatched to transport the steamer's parts back to Shanghai. The hull of the "Anqing" steamer will be temporarily abandoned at Qingshantou, waiting for the water to rise before attempting to drag it away.</p>
<h3>A Neighbor Speaks Out Against the Abuse of a Maid</h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation Sends a Letter Requesting Prevention of Litigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, which stated: "We respectfully report that our Executive Committee member Wang Hanliang has reported that 'I live at No. 14, Hualong Lane, Route des Soeurs, French Concession. The family of Ye Shoujin, who resides at No. 5 in the same lane, keeps a young maid, only twelve years old, who is beaten severely every day, leaving her covered in injuries. On the afternoon of August 12, the maid was again severely beaten and then driven out the back door, with the statement that she would not be taken back. After seeing this, Patrolman Xue Guozhong immediately discussed with me how to provide relief. I pitied her and agreed to find a way, and at the request of the patrolman, I accompanied the maid to the Lujiawan Police Station to file a report. After the Western officer at the police station personally examined the maid's injuries, he sent officers to bring Ye Shoujin's wife to the police station. Unexpectedly, at 6:30 p.m. that afternoon, the police station released Ye's wife and the maid. The maid was made up, bathed, and dressed in new shoes. Only the bao tan informed me to go to the police station at 9 a.m. the next morning, but the next day I was out due to other business on Sunday and did not go to the police station. At around 10 a.m., the police station sent officers to urge me, and my wife went instead. By the time I returned home and found out, she had already left. It was said that the police station had prepared to send the maid to the Jiliang Institute and instructed the neighbors to maintain harmony and avoid disputes. However, the residents of the lane believe that the Ye family's abuse of the young maid is inhumane, and the police station released them without any warning. Therefore, they jointly submitted a report to the Women and Children Relief Association, which has sent officers to investigate. However, after the above incident, the Ye family inevitably holds a grudge against me and even threatened to sue me, which is absurd. Therefore, I report the facts and ask you to forward a letter to the Second Special District Municipal Federation to clarify the facts.' After investigation, keeping slaves and maids has long been strictly prohibited by the government. Now, the Ye family arbitrarily abuses them, which is not only illegal but also inhumane. Committee member Wang speaks out for justice, purely out of public interest, not personal grudges. However, the Ye family does not know how to repent and instead threatens to sue, hoping to harm Committee member Wang's character, which is inappropriate. Correspondingly, we request your association to investigate and forward a letter to the sub-association in that area to earnestly persuade the Ye family, explaining the greater good to avoid creating more trouble and restarting disputes, which would be a public concern."</p>
<h3>Leashed Male Corpse Found in Dachang Creek</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a male corpse was found in a river creek near Baohua Temple (commonly known as Lingjiajiao), about two li southeast of Dachang Town in Baoshan County. Villagers reported this to Tang Xinquan, the dibao of the 21st tu, who reported it to the Dachang Town Public Security Bureau. Bureau Chief Liu Guiting immediately sent Police Chief Zhang Xiaoru to lead police officers to retrieve the floating corpse and drag it to the shore. The deceased was about forty years old, with a flat-top haircut, wearing a white striped short shirt and shorts, and no shoes or socks on his feet. He looked like a northerner. His hands were tied with thick hemp rope, which was looped around his neck, so it was undoubtedly known that he had been strangled to death and then thrown into the creek. Later, while inspecting the nearby fields, two yellow rubber rain boots were found, both covered in mud. They were dropped by the deceased when he struggled with the murderers. Traces in the fields also proved this. However, it was found that the deceased had no family to claim him, so his name was unknown. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the Baoshan County government requesting an autopsy. At around 3 p.m., the reporter took a Shanghai-Tai automobile to see the corpse. The corpse was covered with wheat straw, swarming with flies, and reeking of a foul odor, making it impossible to approach. It seemed that he had been dead for many days, with his feet facing up and his head in the water. Nearby villagers came to watch in an endless stream. The pair of rain boots are now kept at the Public Security Bureau, pending an autopsy, for use as evidence in the investigation and arrest of the murderers.</p>
<h3>Killed by a Watermelon Rind</h3>
<p>Su Liangxin, a 34-year-old man from Hubei, worked as a partner in a coppersmith shop on Meixie Road in Nanshi. The night before last, after dinner, he had nothing to do, so he went to visit a colleague's house on Yingxun Road in Lujiabang. Unexpectedly, when he got there, just as he was about to leave, he stepped on a piece of watermelon rind and fell forward. When people saw him, they rushed forward to help him, but unexpectedly, he had already died. They immediately reported this to the Second Precinct of the Second District. Yesterday, Di Jia Tao Rong was ordered to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Theft of Electricity Case Also Cracked in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Since Lu Liankui, the Chinese Detective Superintendent of the Public Concession Police, cracked a major case of electricity theft, the detectives of the French Police have also paid close attention to it. At 3:30 a.m. yesterday, Hu Yuquan, a Changzhou native living at No. 42, Tingyun Lane, Route Lafayette, French Concession, colluded with Wu Jiangyu, the owner of Taifeng Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 100, Route Aired, to steal electricity from Jinling Restaurant at No. 419 and No. 421, Route Edward VII. First, the restaurant closed its doors after business hours. Then Hu and Jiang went upstairs (because the electric meter was installed upstairs). Their method was to pry open the meter door and insert a lead wire into the numbers to slow down the movement of the internal parts of the meter. Afterwards, they would repair the door as before to make it difficult for the company to detect. This could save five-tenths of the monthly electricity bill. The matter was discovered by detectives Lu Changsheng and Bao Tan Zhou Xianglin of the French Police. They quietly went upstairs and found the loophole. They arrested Hu and Jiang. A pair of lead pliers, a pair of scissors, two large and small chisels, a roll each of lead wire and iron wire, and a lead number were found next to Hu. The detectives believed that the restaurant owner must have colluded with them, but because there was no way to arrest him, they copied several account books, which contained the words "paid to Hu Yuquan 46 yuan last month." They were immediately taken to the police station. Interrogating the defendants, they admitted that they had done the same thing to four or five other families. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer said that the case still needed to be investigated and accomplices arrested, so he requested a postponement for further interrogation. Magistrate Wu briefly interrogated the defendants and ordered them to be detained, granting a postponement for the trial.</p>
<h3>Shen Zuliang Reported for Abusing a Maid</h3>
<p>The current law and party platform stipulate the liberation of all slaves and maids. Anyone who keeps slaves and maids is considered to be obstructing freedom and has been banned for a long time. Unexpectedly, the local court received a letter a few days ago, stating that there was a family in Jiu'an Lane, Huangjia Que Road, Xiaoximen, named Shen Zuliang, who was a native of Jiashi, widely hoarding maids. His mistress was especially vicious, often beating them and forcing them to kneel for long periods, etc. Please report this. Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying immediately appointed Prosecutor Xie Lian to handle the case. This morning, he sent bailiff Zhou Jianqing to investigate. Only one maid, Xiaochun, was inside. Xiaochun was taken to the court and reported to Prosecutor Xie for a preliminary hearing. According to her, she was 19 years old, a native of Jiashi, and her father's name was Wang Shunde, who lived in Wangjiabang, her hometown. Because of the barrenness of farming, she was sold to Gu Yusheng of Jiashi as a maid at the age of twelve for a price of eighty-eight yuan, serving Miss Gu Zhifen (28 years old this year). Three years later, Zhifen married Shen Zuliang (29 years old this year), a staff member of the National Treasury Section of the Central Bank, and I was also given as dowry to the Shen family. Last year, the Shen family sold another young maid in Jiashi, named Ruyi, who was only thirteen years old. We are usually abused and forced to kneel with a stick of incense, etc., which is all true. The four neighbors all know about it. Now I seek to be freed, etc. The prosecutor believed that the facts were clear and should be thoroughly investigated according to the law. Therefore, he ordered the maid to be temporarily detained in the detention center, pending her transfer to the Relief Association for care. Shen Zuliang, Gu Zhifen, and other slave traders should be immediately investigated for their inhumane acts.</p>
<h3>Using Hot Water Bottles as Signals for Gambling on Flower Associations</h3>
<p>Recently, Director Tan of the Sixth District of Caojiadu in West Shanghai discovered that some people were secretly setting up flower association tingtongs and hangchuan (gambling) organizations, sending people out to lure people into gambling and collect money. He has strictly ordered his subordinates to repeatedly crack down on and detain them. However, these people are very cunning and move several times a day, so it is difficult to completely ban them. Now, Director Tan has learned that the famous big tingtong set up by the notorious Fa Fa has even come up with a novel idea: every day, he sends people to wander around Guangfu Road, north of the creek, holding a large hot water bottle as a signal to collect gambling slips, which are all stored in the bottle. After they are collected, they are calculated and plotted in a Jiangbei people's thatched shed, and then the bottle is sent to Shanghai and handed over to Dachang, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Officer Shao was specially dispatched with several police officers to wait at the Dayang Bridge. After a while, they saw a man holding a hot water bottle, rushing across the bridge. They immediately stepped forward, arrested him, and took him to the district. Opening the bottle, they found five flower association charts and one hundred and several dozen small silver coins and more than ten large silver coins. After being interrogated by District Officer Jiang, the man confessed that his name was Chen Agou, a native of Suzhou, and that he was collecting flower associations for Fa Fa. He was sentenced to be sent to the General Bureau for a retrial.</p>
<h3>Two Thieves Caught at the Chunjiang Inn</h3>
<p>Detectives Tang Yunqing and Li Yaolong of the Special Agency of the French Police were patrolling along Mintiniyin Road last night when they apprehended a robber on the spot, named Zhang Genyu, 23 years old, a local. He confessed that his accomplices were hiding in Room 19 of the Chunjiang Inn at No. 309, Caishi Street. They immediately rushed there and arrested two accomplices, named Tang Amao, 17 years old, and Wang Shunkang, 20 years old, both natives of Ningbo. A fake pistol was found at the scene. It was claimed that they had committed several robbery cases.</p>
<h3>Kong Wanyu Commits Suicide by Poisoning Due to a Rent Dispute</h3>
<p>Kong Wanyu, 27 years old, from Yangzhou, the owner of the Xinzhou Barber Shop at No. 504, the corner of Kangnatu Road and Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai, rented his house from the Yutong Company's accounting office. Since the January 28th Incident, due to poor business, he had accumulated six months of rent, totaling 198 yuan at 33 yuan per month. He had once been involved in a lawsuit in court, and the court ordered him to pay in two installments. The first installment had already been paid, but the second installment was scheduled for August 1. When the time came, Kong fulfilled his promise and paid the court, but the court had not yet notified the landlord, resulting in a big mistake. On the 5th of this month, the Tongyu Company rashly ordered people to throw mirrors, barber equipment, and other items from the Xinzhou store into the alley, causing a dispute. The whole lane was noisy. Kong felt humiliated for no reason and was resentful. On the morning of the day before yesterday, he secretly took a heavy dose of quicklime to commit suicide. His father noticed and sent him to the landlord's house by car. The accounting office called the police officer at No. 1659, who escorted him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 11:30 a.m. yesterday.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Photographic Reprinting Society of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka (714 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai) has recently published the Song Dynasty Qisha Tripitaka. The compilation and photography work began at the Wolong Temple of Kaiyuan Temple in Xi'an, and it took more than a year to complete. I feel it is a rare opportunity, so I will briefly describe its history first. Qisha is a place name located north of Chen Lake in the twenty-sixth district of Wu County today. During the eighth year of the Qiandao reign of the Song Dynasty, a Chan master named Jizhang obtained land donated by the Fei family of Chen Lake, calling it Qisha. He built a hermitage on it called Yansheng Temple. The palace halls and buildings gradually became magnificent, and the 6,310 volumes of the Sutra, Vinaya, and Shastra Tripitaka were engraved here, known as the Qisha edition. During the Baoyou period, a major fire occurred, but the Repentance Hall where the sutra blocks were stored, and Master Ji's stupa, remained standing unscathed. Throughout the Yuan and Ming dynasties, it was repeatedly repaired and abandoned, eventually presenting a desolate appearance. Poets from Changzhou, such as Wu Kuan and Shen Zhou, all wrote poems about it. "Passing over the lake as the sun declines, weary of climbing to the wild temple. The sound of the wind combines with the old trees, the rain marks are deep on the dilapidated walls." (Wu Kuan) "The old trees on the sandbar are entwined with wisteria, the ancient temple ruins are green with shepherd's purse. Tonight, I will try to rest my head on a pillow by the lake, the sparse bell and high waves are unbearable to hear." (Shen Zhou) Judging from their poems, their feelings are deep. Now, the area is desolate and vast, only insects and birds chirp sadly, and sails pass by in vain. It is vaguely heard that Mr. Ye Gongchuo once visited the ruins and obtained old carved Buddha images and several stone foundations and tiles, which are displayed in the Ancient Artifacts Museum of Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi. I should visit and see them when I have the time.</p>
<p>Before the Tang Dynasty, the dissemination of Buddhist scriptures mainly relied on handwritten or stone-carved copies. Carving on wooden blocks began in the Five Dynasties and became popular in the Zhao Song Dynasty. It is said that there were six editions of the Song Tripitaka: (1) the Shu edition, carved during the Kaibao reign of Emperor Taizu; (2) the Fuzhou Dongchan Temple edition, carved during the Yuanfeng reign of Emperor Shenzong; (3) the Fuzhou Kaiyuan Temple edition, carved during the Zhenghe reign of Emperor Huizong; (4) the Sixi Wang Yongcong edition, carved during the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong; (5) the Qisha edition, carved during the Shaoding reign of Emperor Lizong; and (6) the Sixi Zifu Temple edition, carved during the Jiaxi reign of Emperor Lizong. These six editions occupy a very important position in the history of Buddhism, but only fragments and incomplete copies are found at home and abroad, and few can be seen. Even the complete catalog of the Tripitaka only has one or two types that can be verified. Currently, the Shaanxi Temple actually houses 6,310 volumes of the Qisha printed edition, which, after 702 years, are mostly intact. Each block has five faces, each face has six lines, and each line has seventeen characters. The Buddha images at the beginning of each volume are as many as eight or nine types, with exquisite carvings and elegant paper and ink. It must be said to be a rare treasure. The association took photos to preserve the original blocks' true appearance, each original carved wooden block was photographed as a whole sheet, and bound horizontally, without any cutting or alteration, making it extremely convenient for reading and research, and making it a unique style among Song editions.</p>
<p>The entire Tripitaka project is arduous and cannot be completed by one person alone. However, there is no definite proof as to who initiated it. Those whose names are listed in the volumes include Fan Xian in July of the fourth year of Shaoding, and monks Shancheng, Facheng, Faru, Fasheng, and Chaozhi in May of the fifth year of Shaoding. They may have provided financial support or solicited donations, but they may not necessarily be the initiators of this Tripitaka. According to the preface by Feng Mengzhen in the Jiaxing edition of the square-book Tripitaka carved during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty, "The origin of the Qisha Tripitaka carving was that the nun Hongdao cut off her arm to raise funds. After Hongdao's death, her disciples continued to cut off their arms to succeed her. After three generations, their wish was fulfilled. We men cannot deeply believe in the Dharma and carve and circulate it. We are not as good as a woman." Also, in the preface by Lu Guangqi, "It is said that in the past, a woman named Cui Fazhen cut off her arm to raise funds to carve the Tripitaka, which took thirty years to complete. At that time, a devotee who bankrupted his family responded to her." The statements of Feng and Lu are not known on what they are based. Yuan monk Yuanzhi once wrote a record of Yansheng Temple, and the original text is recorded in the Shouqian Collection, which does not mention Hongdao and Fazhen at all. If there was such a pure, bitter, courageous act, it should not have been omitted from the record. Even the catalog carved in the first year of the Duanping reign, which was sponsored by Wu Shi, lists the donors as Fachong and not Fazhen. Also, it is not known whether Fa was a Bhikkhuni. These seem to be questions. I will try to defend Feng and Lu with my humble opinion: (1) According to the Changzhou County Chronicle, "Qisha Temple was rebuilt by monk Zhiduan in the fifteenth year of Yongle, and he led three hermitages: Jifu, Jiqing, and Yingfu. Rebuilding must follow the old system, and the three hermitages should be the original ones. According to the Suzhou custom, hermitages mostly house Bhikkhunis. Then Hongdao and Fazhen may be figures from the three hermitages." (2) The inscriptions at the end of each sutra volume list many women who donated money, and Wu Shi donated more than 110 strings of official coins, which is a huge sum. The catalog is placed at the beginning of the entire Tripitaka, which she single-handedly carved, which is of great importance. If there were no admirable nuns who solicited donations from among them, I am afraid there would not be such a grand event. However, I still dare not affirm it as a fact, pending future extensive research.</p>
<p>This Tripitaka was printed in Jiangnan, the most culturally prosperous area, but Su and Zhe and other places could not preserve it. Some temples in Japan have seen it, but only the editions continued in the Yuan Dynasty. Therefore, Luo Genyu's Song and Yuan Buddhist Tripitaka Examination is based on the Yuan edition. In the Duanping catalog of the Showa Treasure, only the 合 character is listed, totaling 5,857 volumes, which is far from the complete catalog. The association has actually found 6,310 volumes through field visits. Shaanxi Province is located in the remote western frontier, rarely visited, and the land is high and dry, not prone to decay. Therefore, this scripture is like an old monk in an ancient cave, suddenly awakening from meditation, not seeking to be known, and not being known by people until the Republic of China, when Mr. Kang Youwei discovered it during his travels in Shaanxi. He initially planned to bundle and transport it to Shanghai, but was stopped by the people of Shaanxi. In the summer of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhu Qinglan visited Shaanxi on official business and, upon seeing this treasure, was overjoyed and praised it. He then decided to reprint it photographically. After the Shaanxi Provincial Government solicited opinions from local groups, everyone agreed. Mr. Zhu, along with Ye Gongchuo, Di Baoxian, Xu Naichang, and Wu Zhaozeng, established an association in Shanghai to make practical plans. They also entrusted Master Fan Chengfa of Rugao to first organize the scriptures. For three months, in July of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, dozens of editors, reviewers, and photographers were specially sent to Shaanxi to photograph each volume onto glass plates, totaling 84,336 numbers (with additional numbers elsewhere). They were successively packed into boxes and transported to Shanghai for printing. One-fourth of the printing has now been completed. It is estimated that the complete set will be bound into 592 volumes. This September, 150 volumes will be released. In March of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, 150 volumes will be released. In September of the same year, 150 volumes will be released. All volumes will be released in March of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China. Each set is priced at 750 yuan, and early reservations are offered at a 30% discount, effectively 525 yuan. As a result of the organization of this collection, more than 200 volumes were found to be missing. Copies of the Song Dynasty Sixi Zifu Temple edition, the Song Dynasty Jingding Lu Daoyuan edition, the Yuan Dynasty Puning edition, and the Yuan Dynasty Yanyou Yike Mishi edition have been obtained to supplement them one by one. However, the association is still not satisfied and is still searching for better editions for comparison, so that they can be replaced at any time. It is rumored that the Yueshan Temple in Qinghua Town, Henan, the Kaiyuan Temple in Quanzhou, Fujian, and the Kunming City Library in Yunnan all have fragments of Song and Yuan Tripitaka, and the Guangfu Temple in Zhaocheng, Shanxi, is also said to have long scroll-style Song and Yuan Tripitaka. These are being carefully examined separately. In the future, the Qisha edition will be the main body of this Tripitaka, and the best of other Song and Yuan editions will be selected and attached to it, which will definitely have excellent value.</p>

<h3>Pigsy-ism</h3>
<p>— Thin Gull</p>
<p>Journey to the West is, of course, a very good novel. Its refined structure, beautiful descriptions, clever metaphors, and many fantastic and imaginative plots indeed have the value of being passed down for centuries. However, the part about Pigsy was once attacked by some of us novel fans a few years ago. Because at that time we were inexperienced and full of the high-sounding maxims of those great sages and worthies, we thought that planting melons would definitely yield melons, and planting beans would naturally yield beans. Pigsy, seemingly honest but actually treacherous, not only could not subdue demons and monsters to protect Tang Sanzang along the way, but instead kept touching the Monkey King's raw nerve, causing discord among the master and disciples, and causing Tang Sanzang to fall into the demon's lair several times, almost losing his life. In addition, he never changed his lustful nature, and wanted to take liberties with women he met, from the Spider Demon, the White Bone Demon to the Guanyin Bodhisattva, he pursued them all very enthusiastically. How could someone like this, still influenced by the seven emotions, be considered a cultivator? Moreover, whenever he encountered any difficulties, he was always the first to shout "Let's break up," "Let's break up," his lack of firmness in his Buddhist faith could be said to have reached the extreme. Although he once had a small display of diligence, "Wuneng working hard in the thorny forest," small good deeds could not offset great evils, and there was still a long way to go. According to us, awarding him a whole corpse to return to the east was already an extra kindness, how could he later ascend to the Western Paradise and be honorably named "Purifying Altar Messenger"? Was the Buddha too muddled? If the Buddha wasn't muddled, it must be a loophole by the writer. The above is the theory we purely defined from the theoretical aspect a few years ago. Now that we have more experience and think carefully, we realize that we were wrong. The reason is that although Pigsy's real skills are not good, his flattery skills are really excellent. Look at how much Tang Sanzang dotes on him, it can be seen that Tang Sanzang not only did not see his wickedness, but instead felt that he was a thousand times good, so when his old man arrived at the Vulture Peak, he must have strongly recommended him to the Buddha and said a lot of good words for him. Fortunately, the Buddha's mind was still clear, so he only awarded him a "Messenger," and did not bestow upon him a Namo something Buddha. This kind of fact seems like a contradiction in the writer's work, but in fact, he is painstakingly pointing you in the right direction in secret! But look at those friends today who learn from Pigsy's example, not doing practical work, but specializing in flattery, touching the raw nerves of good people, which one of them is not successful? In addition, those brothers who are high above people today are muddle-headed, so those who embrace "Pigsy-ism" can almost all become immortals and Buddhas, enjoy all the wealth and glory in the world, and the peep show will never be exposed, so now I am greatly enlightened. Journey to the West is not only an excellent novel, but also contains half a "Secret to Getting Along in the World"! I hope everyone will promote "Pigsy-ism"!</p>
<h3>Talking About Ice</h3>
<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>If you saw a whole block of ice open with</p>
<p>saw, or after smashed with a hammer, then never composite period, which Wan is than our expensive Republic of China national character, never connected of inferiority. In after drinking ice of moment, suddenly felt the heart is sober, perception sensitive, but wait until cool down, and still is dull confused. This is like every time we suffer a national shame, then everyone its mighty enthusiastic excitement, wait until the appropriate period after, but again silent.</p>
<p>Put a piece of solid ice block, throw into the ice-cream machine, made a sweet ice condensation chain, to quick people's appetite, like us many engaged enemy and militia for the country die: They although is some strong unyielding of loyal member, but after all withstand imperialism elite weapons of torture, the results are the powder, and fill the enemy's greedy ditch.</p>
<h3>Japanese Women</h3>
<p>— Wing</p>
<p>The Japanese women I have seen in recent novels are all lovely: especially those like Chen Jichang not only find them lovely, but also can't help but blame themselves for not marrying a Japanese woman and enjoying the wife's respect and consideration for a lifetime. It is said that all the writers who write about Japanese women in novels have been to Japan and seen them with their own eyes, not at all mistaken. Therefore, even though the Japanese warlords are fiercely invading China, and Chinese writers are moaning in the tragic atmosphere of national crisis, Japanese women are still written as lovely in novels: this is because the loveliness of Japanese women is a real thing and cannot be deliberately written as the opposite. Look, our writers have never written the faces of Japanese warlords as lovely.</p>
<p>Originally, someone had made three wishes long ago, what are the three wishes? One of them is that when he wants to marry, he wants to marry a Japanese woman, and another seems to be that when he wants to eat, he wants to eat Chinese food. As for the other wish, he can't remember what it is: it can be seen that there must be many people in the world who want to marry a Japanese woman. Who knew that there are exceptions, Japanese women are not all lovely, this example is a wonder! As in a recent case in Nantong, according to the Japanese newspaper, Huang Yulun, a professor of medicine at Nantong University, recently had a bad relationship with his Japanese wife, Otsuka Kaneko. Otsuka actually stabbed Huang with a knife. Huang avoided it and sued his wife for murder in court. The prosecutor's office scheduled a hearing on the 14th and summoned Huang's eight-year-old eldest son to testify in court. Just because of a bad relationship, she stabbed her husband with a knife. Huang Yulun was lucky to avoid it, otherwise, he might have died under the knife. This is several times more fierce than Chinese shrewish wives, and almost the same as the ferocious face of Japanese warlords and their killing like hemp! Why are Japanese women always so lovely in our new novels?</p>
<p>Some people say: Japanese women are indeed lovely. It's just that there is a distinction between noble and lowly between the Chinese and Japanese races, so Japanese wives and Chinese husbands cannot be generalized with Japanese wives and Japanese husbands. If you want to marry a Japanese wife, you must first work hard to improve the status of the nation. This is also true! ~</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings on the Municipal Zoo</h3>
<p>— Junen</p>
<p>The zoo opposite the Confucius Temple is open! Xue and I, filled with the joy of touring, ran to the zoo. The people at the ticket office were so crowded, holding copper coins in their hands and shouting "Two tickets, two tickets." The ticket seller didn't even glance at you. Seeing the ticket squeezed up, it was taken out again by that hateful fat man. Okay! The ticket is in hand! Squeeze out a path and Xue and I ran inside, ignoring the fragrance and sweat!</p>
<p>Tearing the ticket, I immediately saw a big cage, covered with pieces of reed mats, inside there are various kinds of birds, there are small artificial hills, and also shallow ponds, even more deep fountains! It's a pity that it doesn't spray high. Brushing the swaying willows, passing a bend of green water, it's the beasts! That leopard, covered in gold coin-like spots, like a rich man, was pacing in the cage, sniffing the iron net, and looking at the people outside the cage. Obviously, it harbored bad intentions, but the cage door was tightly closed, it could only huff, like a village schoolboy writing poetry, huff back and forth, maybe it was thinking carefully!</p>
<p>That tiger, how lazy! Just lying in the narrow cage, letting the people shout loudly, even banging on the iron door behind the cage, it just ignored the people, it really has a good composure.</p>
<p>Okay! That lion, hailed as the king of beasts, is actually sleeping! Letting the people outside the cage peep and ridicule, letting the young lads take pictures with the camera, it just lay complacently in the shade where the sunlight couldn't reach, without saying a word. If you say it's not sleeping, then what is it doing? Alas: Sleeping lion! When will you wake up?</p>
<p>Men, women, and children were watching the monkeys fight, the children were watching with their little mouths wide open and laughing. An old man stroking his beard said: "These two oil-fried, even of the same kind still fight, what's there to watch?" The crowd heard it and couldn't help but glance at him.</p>
<p>Foxes, civets, and black bears were lying leisurely in the cage, with pieces of beef lying on the ground; the cage, half in the open air and half in the house, many people saw it and couldn't help but sigh and say: "People are also not so comfortable, these two beasts are really blessed."</p>
<p>Idlers, some were dozing in the artificial mountain cave, some were enjoying the cool in the fragrant pavilion, naughty children were playing the "Tiger Mountain" game.</p>
<p>The sunlight shone on my forehead a little dizzy, the whole park could not find a suitable shelter, so I had to sneak out with Xue from the "Exit"; although the standard clock on the roadside was only pointing at ten o'clock in the morning, the wastepaper basket at the ticket-tearing office was already full.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen</p>
<p>Abandoning His Post, He Meets a Soulmate, the Beauty Tacitly Agrees</p>
<p>Receiving Blessings from His Family, the Strong Man Rejoices</p>
<p>Jiang saw it and waved his hand repeatedly, saying: Wine is fine, but I can't drink any of it. Zhao Weng laughed and said: If you don't drink, I won't force you. But I'm so happy in my heart that I have to drink a couple of cups. You just eat, and I'll drink with you. As he said this, he had already sat down. Jiang knew that this old man was a straightforward person, so there was no need to be too polite, and she sat down in the seat opposite him. Zhao Weng first picked up his cup, took a sip of wine, nodded and smiled. Although he didn't say anything, he seemed to be very appreciative of the wine's flavor. This sip of wine was like a pick-me-up. After drinking it, he perked up. He laughed: Old Mrs. Yang, thank you for your kindness. Just now, Company Commander Guan said that you have already agreed to this marriage. I'm really happy as can be and immediately wanted to find some wine to drink. To be honest, my boy is really not good enough for your daughter, but he is a sincere fellow. Jiang said: Company Commander Guan also said that since I don't like military men, he is willing to give up his position. I thought, what is this about? As relatives, isn't it desirable for relatives to be doing well? To throw away one's future for the sake of marriage, that's going too far. Zhao Weng said: To be honest with you, I didn't have any strong opinions when this boy of mine first joined the army. Whatever he wanted to do, he could do. Later, as he slowly climbed up the ranks, I let him stick with it. Firstly, when a person digs a well, he should dig one well, keep digging downwards, and he will always find water. If he digs several feet deep and doesn't see water, and then goes to dig a new place, then he will dig wells all his life and never find water. This boy of mine has already been in the military for so many years and has dug more than half of the well. I can only tell him to keep going. Secondly, I have always said that if you take someone's penny, you must do a penny's worth of work for them. As the saying goes, "Raise an army for a thousand days, use it for one morning." Now is precisely the time when the country needs the army: Jiang said: Old Master, you are right. (163)</p>

<h3>Publicly Funded Students to Study in England to Set Sail Early Next Month</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 19th) Regarding the recruitment examination for publicly funded students to study in England using the Boxer Indemnity funds, according to Hang Liwu's statement to reporters, to facilitate examinees, the results will be announced within three days after the examination. The 48 examiners hired from schools in Tianjin, Wuhan, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places have all arrived successively. The departure date of September 5th has been confirmed, and tickets have been purchased. They will definitely depart for England to begin their studies without any delay, he said.</p>
<h3>Results of Jiangxi Province Qualification Examination Announced</h3>
<p>Those Fully Qualified: 3 Higher Level, 2 General Level</p>
<p>Those Qualified by Subject: 37 Higher Level, 21 General Level</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The results of the Jiangxi Province Qualification Examination have been announced. There are three fully qualified candidates at the higher level and two at the general level. There are thirty-seven candidates qualified by subject at the higher level and twenty-one at the general level. All qualification certificates and subject-specific qualification certificates have been processed by the Department of Education. According to regulations, all chief examiners should sign and stamp the certificates or letters of certification under the subject they examined. Therefore, Cheng Shih-kuei, the Director of the Department of Education, specially convened a training session for the qualified candidates on the 12th in the department, attended by over forty people. He first explained the process of conducting the qualification examination under orders, followed by the two principles of the central government in holding the examination: (1) examination opportunities must be widespread; (2) the administration of the examination must be strict. The department followed these principles, and its important significance lies in three points: (1) It is to find a way out for young people, so all registration fees were waived, and the deadline was extended repeatedly; (2) Anciently, it was said to respect teachers and value the Way. There are two types of teachers: one is the teacher who is respected, and the other is the teacher who imparts knowledge. The qualified candidates this time have received special attention from the department. They must strive for progress in their studies and cultivation to live up to the original intention of selection; (3) In the past, examination authorities considered the matter finished once the examination was completed. However, the department will include educational opinions in everything it does and will continue to provide guidance in the future, hoping that everyone will pass the examination in the future.</p>

<h3>### Shanghai Art College Responds to Ministry of Education's Request for Opinions on Changing the Junior College System</h3>
<p>After returning from Europe the year before last, Liu Haisu, the president of Shanghai Art College, suggested to the Ministry of Education to improve the current junior college system. After receiving instructions from the Ministry of Education to solicit opinions on the reform, President Liu convened several discussions with experts and drafted a curriculum allocation table for art junior colleges, which he submitted to the Ministry of Education for review. The original text is transcribed below: Regarding the matter of responding to the request, we received Instruction No. 6106 from your ministry, stating that Jiangxi Provincial Industrial Junior College submitted a report stating the difficulties in enrollment and requesting permission to change the admission qualifications for junior colleges to recruit junior high school graduates and extend the study period to five years, and solicited the common opinions of various junior colleges. Our school is an art junior college, and although the difficulties stated by Jiangxi Provincial Industrial Junior College are slightly different, in order to cultivate sound artistic talents, we have long planned to request your ministry to change the current junior college system. Now that we have been consulted, in addition to fully agreeing with the points stated by Jiangxi Industrial Junior College, we are submitting the following supplementary points regarding the difficulties of implementing the old system in art junior colleges: (1) The curriculum of senior high school general courses is generally a preparation for entering university liberal arts and science departments. After three years of study, students will inevitably tend towards science and rarely wish to enter art junior colleges. The regulations of senior high school normal courses stipulate that not going to university is the principle. Graduates of other subjects such as commerce, engineering, and agriculture are even less likely to study art again because they have already received graduation training. Therefore, it is very difficult for art junior colleges to recruit senior high school graduates in practice. (2) Assuming that enrollment does not pose a difficulty, even if senior high school graduates learn art halfway through, it is still very reluctant in terms of learning psychology. This is because the learning period for art is valuable when one is young, unlike other technologies. Music, in particular, should be engaged in during childhood to be successful. Now that senior high school graduates have focused on science, switching to art will not only waste the previous years of study, but also affect the efficiency of art learning due to increased age. (3) Considering the study period, art junior colleges feel that the learning period is too short to train specialized talents in three years. The study of art is endless and cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Having examined art schools in Italy, France, Belgium, and Germany, studying pure art generally does not limit the graduation period. Art schools in our country currently have to engage in applied art, which is not convenient to imitate for the time being, but setting the study period to three years is ultimately insufficient. Based on the above situation, we propose that your ministry quickly revise and change the current junior college system: 1. Change the study period of junior colleges to five years, with the first two years as preliminary and the last three years as undergraduate; 2. Recruit junior high school graduates; 3. Set up remedial classes with a study period of one year, specially for senior high school graduates to study the necessary knowledge and skills before entering the undergraduate program; 4. Set up research departments without a time limit. This is intended to be limited to the pure art aspects of art schools, specially for graduates and qualified university graduates and specialized apprentices to pursue further studies, in order to embody the profound meaning of European art schools not limiting the graduation period. Music schools can also imitate this. Therefore, we have drafted a curriculum allocation table for art junior colleges and submitted it together for your consideration and selection. Whether it is appropriate, we have prepared a document to respond to the request, hoping for your review and decision, and earnestly request that you quickly formulate regulations for art junior colleges and promulgate them nationwide for compliance and to avoid disputes, which would be for the public good.</p>
<h3>Professors and Students to Sit Quietly for Half an Hour After Lunch</h3>
<p>Experiment by the Principal of Mill Hill School in London</p>
<p>Resting After Lunch is Beneficial to Physical and Mental Health and Increases Weight; Attracts Attention from Principals Nationwide</p>
<p>(Reuters, London) Jacks, the principal of Mill Hill School in London, orders students to sit quietly for thirty minutes after lunch every day. Jacks said that at first, one or two active students found this very difficult, but they gradually got used to it. Not only did they get used to it, but they also enjoyed it, because many students felt that this move was beneficial and rarely felt tired in the afternoon. I thought that if the children were allowed to rest after lunch, it would be beneficial to their physical and mental health, so I implemented this method at the beginning of this year. It has not been implemented for long, so I cannot say its effects, but at Christmas, the students' weight was even greater than in previous Christmases, he said. Currently, principals across the country are paying close attention to this experiment. According to Alice, the secretary of the Education Committee of the National Union of Teachers, the issue of children's fatigue and rest has been explored for a long time, but it needs careful consideration by experts. Fatigue is especially important to us. Jacks' experiment is not only concerned by principals of public schools, but also arouses interest among primary school staff.</p>

<h3>Triangular Swimming Competition: Xiqing Sweeps the Championship</h3>
<p>Chinese Second, Japan Third; Individual Championships Also Belong to Xiqing</p>
<p>First Place in the First Eight Events Also Taken by Xiqing Athletes</p>
<p>Chinese Athletes Have Made Considerable Progress, But Turns are Slightly Slow</p>
<p>The triangular swimming competition among China, Xiqing, and Japan was held at the Xiqing Swimming Pool at 8:30 last night. The audience was packed and excited. For each competition, the audience gave enthusiastic applause. The Xiqing team, with its wealth of talent, swept the team and individual championships. The championships in each event were also taken by Xiqing athletes. The results were outstanding. China and Japan competed fiercely for second place. The overall result was that Xiqing won the championship with 46 points, China was second with 25 points, and Japan was third with 13 points. Dr. Gray presented the awards after the competition. The Fumin Cup was retained by Xiqing for one year. In the eight events, Hartle, Heggins Ding, and Logan of the Xiqing team each won two groups. Hartle is excellent in short-distance sprints. Heggins Ding won the breaststroke and backstroke. Logan is rich in endurance, so the 200 and 440-yard freestyle belonged to Logan. Hartle also participated in two relay races, so he scored the highest individual total, with 16 points. Heggins Ding was second with 13 points because he only participated in one relay race. Logan was third with 10 points.</p>
<p>In the 440-yard freestyle, Chen Yuquan of China and Logan of Xiqing competed fiercely. Before 300 yards, Chen was about one and a half yards ahead of Logan. However, Logan was not in a hurry and moved forward smoothly, with a very calm attitude. It was clear at a glance that he was well-versed in the art. By 350 yards, Logan had caught up with Chen, and then splashed water and advanced rapidly, greatly increasing his speed. At the finish line, Logan beat Chen Yuquan by the length of one pool, or 25 yards.</p>
<p>In the 200-yard relay, the Xiqing athletes made waves and strove to be first. China and Japan were far from their opponents. However, the competition for second place was extremely fierce between the Chinese and Japanese athletes. At the finish line, China only won by one foot. The Xiqing team broke the Xiqing Swimming Pool record of 2 minutes and 5.2 seconds with a time of 1 minute and 56.2 seconds. In the 150-yard mixed relay, there was fierce competition between China and Xiqing. Because China had repeatedly succumbed to Xiqing, they hoped to win the championship in the final mixed relay. In the first leg, Yang Yuanhua of China and Ma Fatuo of Xiqing were evenly matched in the backstroke. In the second leg, Li Rixin of China and Heggins Ding of Xiqing were still on the same level. However, in the third leg freestyle, Xiqing used the famous player Hartle and finally overwhelmed Li Rongyao of China to take first place. China still failed to realize its championship dream. The time of the Xiqing team was 1 minute and 36.2 seconds, which also broke the original record of 1 minute and 39 seconds for the Xiqing Swimming Pool.</p>
<p>Looking at the results of the Chinese athletes this time, all have made considerable progress. Li Rongyao, Yang Gaohua, Chen Yuquan, Li Rixin, and Lin Jiangshui all have considerable skills. However, the famous Yin Yanjun has not made any progress. The fancy diving of the little hero Hu Qijie won a lot of applause from the audience. The biggest weakness of the Chinese athletes is that they are too slow to turn around, which should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>The scoring method, except for the relays calculated at 5-3-1, the rest is 5-3-2-1. Individual scores are also calculated at 5-3-2-1. However, those who participate in the relay race and win first place receive an additional three points. The scores obtained by the three teams are as follows:</p>

<p>Rotary Cup</p>
<h3>International Tennis Tournament: China Wins Doubles Yesterday and Obtains Right to Finals</h3>
<p>Japan Forfeits; Portugal Takes Victory</p>
<p>Three Singles Matches This Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the International Tennis Rotary Cup competition. The fate of the China-America battle and the Portugal-Japan competition depended on the outcome of the day's doubles matches. After a hard-fought five sets, China-America ended 3-2. China defeated the United States by a score of 3-0 with two singles wins and one doubles win, thus obtaining the right to the finals. Portugal and Japan had each won a group before, so they were bound to fight hard to win the doubles match in order to gain an advantage. Indeed, the situation between Portugal and Japan was tense and full of changes. If Kimura had not been old and weak, and his hamstring had not cramped, causing him to forfeit, Portugal's victory would have required a lot of effort. Portugal is ahead 2-1. Today, they only need one victory to participate in the championship with China. In fact, it may not be difficult for Colassa to defeat Suto today.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Strenuous Five-Set Battle</h3>
<p>At a surprising time of half-past four, the Sino-American tennis match began. Smith, with his fierce serves, gained the upper hand. Yu Tian-guang was overly cautious, which led to errors. The first set was won by the Americans. Zheng Zhao-jia followed, and after several struggles, he managed to win the second set, making it a 1-1 tie. The third, fourth, and fifth sets were won consecutively by the Americans. However, in both the fourth and fifth sets, the Chinese team was constantly in a superior position but ultimately lost due to their own mistakes. Then, in the sixth set, Zheng won with his sharp and fast serves, but unexpectedly lost the seventh set. The eighth set was won by Yu's effort. At that time, the Americans were leading 5-3. The ninth set was crucial for the Chinese team's survival. The two American players focused on Yu, repeatedly attacking him, and finally won, completing the first set with a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>The situation eased. China lost the first set, seemingly indicating a one-sided trend. However, the two young warriors, full of enthusiasm, fought bravely and did not diminish their ambition. Moreover, the wonderful cooperation that had not been seen for a long time reappeared. The situation between the two sides became more moderate. They took turns winning points with their serves. After reaching 3-3, it was Yu's turn to serve, and his shots hit the opponent's key points, giving him a 4-3 lead. Smith's serves were unfavorable, with repeated self-inflicted errors that were unstoppable. The balanced situation was broken. Zheng then used pressing slices and powerful shots to defeat the enemy, and the second set was won by China with a score of 6-3.</p>
<p>Great Success Achieved. The third set was similar to the second. Each team took turns winning points with their serves. After reaching 4-4, a sudden change occurred. At that time, the Americans were leading 5-4, and Zheng's serve suddenly failed, ending the fate of that set. As a result, the Americans won with a score of 6-4. Yu performed exceptionally well in the fourth set. Initially, both sides held their ground, but after reaching 2-2, the American line wavered and could not resist. China scored four consecutive games, winning the fourth set with a score of 6-2. The fifth set was played at dusk, making it difficult for spectators to distinguish and even harder for players to observe. The sharpness of serves, the speed of net play, and a strong and determined mind were particularly important. The victory depended entirely on these factors. The Chinese duo, Zheng and Yu, had a particularly good performance. After 2-2, they almost controlled the game, ultimately winning with a score of 6-3, achieving a great success with a score of 6-3.</p>

<h3>Japan Forfeits, Portuguese Win</h3>
<p>A Near Miss. This group started at three o'clock. The Portuguese player S. Colaco played the most brilliantly. Costa lost his usual form, and the failure of the first two sets was his fault. However, the two had strong physical strength and ultimately gained the upper hand. The Japanese players Kimura and Noguchi were both good fighters. They won the first set with a score of 6-2, seemingly without any effort. The determination of the second set took too long, with as many as twenty games played. The Japanese won, but their strength was completely lost. They lost the third set with a score of 2-6. The fourth set reached a 4-4 tie. Kimura suffered a hamstring cramp and was unable to continue, forfeiting the match, giving the Portuguese the advantage today. The unfinished scores of the day were as follows:</p>
<p>S. Colaco Costa (Portuguese) {2 6 9 2 6 2 4 4 Japan Forfeits}</p>
<h3>Today's Three Singles Order</h3>
<p>Since China defeated the United States 3-0, they have obtained the right to the finals. The two singles matches between China and the United States from now on will not affect the outcome. With a better situation, Portugal will definitely not give up. Moreover, their talent is outstanding. If the Japanese want to reverse the situation, it will be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>Machida (Japan) vs. Messel (Portugal) at 4:00 PM</p>

<h3>In Defense of Translation</h3>
<p>— Luo Wen</p>
<p>This year is the year to besiege translation.</p>
<p>Some say "literal translation," some say "hearsay." There are now many translators who "translate the first line as they open the book," and there is no way to talk about understanding the original work, so people read it and "don't know what it means." This phenomenon is indeed common in the translation field, and the root cause is "rushing." Chinese people originally like to "rush," whether it's getting on or off the tram, buying train tickets, or sending registered letters, they all want to be the first to arrive. Translators are naturally no exception. And bookstores and readers really don't have the capacity or resources to accommodate two translations of the same original. As long as there is one translation, no bookstore is willing to accept and publish another translation, because it is said that one already exists and people are afraid that no one will buy it anymore.</p>
<p>Let me give an example here: Darwin's "Origin of Species," which has now become a classic, has two Japanese translations. The first one published has many errors, and the second one is good. China only has one translation by Dr. Ma Junwu, but it is based on the bad Japanese translation, so there is a real need for another translation. But where would a bookstore be willing to publish it? Unless the translator is also a millionaire, he can print it himself. But if he were a millionaire, he would go and do business and never bother with translation again.</p>
<p>Another factor is that trends in China really pass too quickly. When a field of knowledge or literature is introduced to China, it usually disappears within a year at most, or half a year at least. Translators who make a living from translation, if they put their heart and soul into it and deliberate carefully, by the time they finish their manuscript, no one in society cares about it anymore. China shouted loudly about Tolstoy, shouted loudly about Turgenev, and later shouted loudly about Sinclair, but not a single collection of their works has been published. Although Mr. Guo Moruo's famous "War and Peace" was fortunately published last year, I am afraid it is still not enough to reverse the laziness of the reading and publishing circles, and it will inevitably lead to readers becoming tired, translators becoming tired, and publishers becoming tired. In the end, it will never be completed.</p>
<p>The failure of translation is of course mostly the responsibility of the translators, but the reading and publishing circles, especially the critics, should also share some responsibility. To remedy this decline, there must be correct criticism, pointing out the bad and rewarding the good. If there is none, then the better ones can also be pointed out. But how can this be done? It doesn't matter to criticize bad translations of translators who have no power or influence, but if you offend someone with a background, they will put a red hat on you and simply take your life. This phenomenon forces critics to be vague.</p>
<p>In addition, the most common dissatisfaction with translation now is that you can't understand it even after reading dozens of lines. But this should be differentiated. If it is a book like Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason," then even if a German person reads the original text, if he is not an expert, he will still not be able to understand it for a while. Naturally, translators who "translate the first line as they open the book" are too irresponsible, but it is too irresponsible for readers to indiscriminately demand that everything be translated so that they can understand it on the first line.</p>
<h3>Motherland and Place to Use One's Talents</h3>
<p>— Suo Yuan</p>
<p>"New China" No. 10 has an article by Mr. Zhang Menglin, "The English 85 Movement and Basic English," which was later retitled "The Origin of Basic English" and included in "Basic English Grammar" as the first chapter of the book. This article not only briefly explains what Basic English is, but also provides a glimpse into the opinions of the creators of Basic English and the Chinese proponents regarding language issues. One passage concerns the issue of international languages. Mr. Zhang believes that Volapük, Esperanto, Ipo, etc., "artificial international languages," "although each has tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of supporters, are still not widely popular." What is the reason? First, "these world languages are not naturally occurring, living national languages, but artificial, dead things." Second, "learning this kind of language is like learning another foreign language." Third, "and it has no motherland, that is, even if you learn it, there is no place to use your talents," so "they can no longer appeal." As a result, "a natural, living international language emerged." What kind of "living international language" is it? Mr. Zhang said: "This international language, to be honest, is English." This language's "trademark" is called "English-American Scientific International Commercial English," "from the first letters of these English words," it was "named Basic English."</p>
<p>I cannot agree with Mr. Zhang's opinion. Since the 17th century, there have been no fewer than hundreds of proposals for artificial international languages. And only Esperanto (World Language), in its forty-six years of history, has witnessed the淘汰 (elimination) and death of other international languages and has gradually been applied to various sectors, constantly developing. The reason for the death of other artificial international languages is not "artificiality" but other reasons. Esperanto's ability to survive to this day is proof. So although they are both artificial international languages, it is unfair to lump Esperanto together with other international languages.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the issue of whether a language is dead or alive, the standard is definitely not whether the language is a "living national language" or whether it has a "motherland" or a "place to use one's talents," but whether the language is being used. The most obvious example is Latin, which undoubtedly used to be a "living national language" and also had a "motherland" and a "place to use one's talents," but who would dare to call it a "living" language now? As for the fact that Esperanto is widely used, it is an undeniable fact. China has translated many literary works from Esperanto. "Impressions of Moscow" and "Travels in New Russia," two travelogues of traveling to the Soviet Union solely on Esperanto, further prove the practicality of this language. The International Workers' Games to be held in Moscow have also decided that all instructions will be given in Esperanto. Thirdly, saying that learning Esperanto "is like learning another foreign language" is indeed the case. But doesn't learning Basic English "equal learning another foreign language"? We are not Indians yet, and Mr. Zhang's reason is untenable.</p>
<p>Again, Esperanto "has no motherland" and "no place to use one's talents." That is absolutely true. Precisely because it "has no motherland," it is fit to be an international language. If its "motherland" were the United States or England, although it could be used to get rich, become a comprador, or go to London to receive a medal from the British monarch, there would be a "place to use one's talents," but I am afraid there would not be "hundreds of thousands of supporters."</p>
<p>All attempts to use a certain national language as an international language have a long history and will inevitably come again in the future. Even if it has a "motherland" and a "place to use one's talents," it will eventually fail. And Esperanto will continue to grow in the hands of people who "have no motherland" and need international unity. All opposition from people who "have a place to use their talents" will not harm it in the slightest.</p>
<h3>Factory Street</h3>
<p>— Lin Yizhi</p>
<p>Even if it were not at such a twilight hour, Factory Street would always appear gloomy. The heat of ninety-odd degrees heavily weighed down the dust on the street, and a river of stagnant, green-blue turbid water lay motionless, exuding an odor of ammonia.</p>
<p>Gloomy skies, gloomy rivers, gloomy factory walls, and gloomy figures of pedestrians—everything looked gloomy. In the dust-covered factory windows, the yellowish electric lights reflected the ceaseless whirling of leather belts, and even the singing of the machines seemed so gloomy.</p>
<p>But great labor was underway. The machines brandished their steel teeth, chewing on dark, massive blocks of wood. From the iron gates yonder, carts loaded with clean, white planks and metal-clad boxes were being transported. On the high-rise construction of the ice factory across the river, shimmering water sprays danced within the dense iron framework. Huge steel pipes led to the workshops beneath the framework. In the workshops, under the blazing electric lights, shadowy figures bustled about: For the sake of delicious dishes in wealthy kitchens, for the sake of refreshing ice cream after a waltz, the workers were bursting with muddy sweat in the intense heat, manufacturing those clean, white, and crystalline blocks of artificial ice.</p>
<p>Yet all the consumption and enjoyment were so far removed from this place. Here there was only filthy coal smoke and filthy sweat; just as one could not hear the sound of machines from the gardens of summer villas, so here one could not hear the jazz music from the dance halls. Replacing this jubilant music was the heavy factory whistle.</p>
<p>The whistle shrieked, and in the ever-darkening twilight, large crowds of male and female workers poured out. From five or six o'clock in the morning to six or seven o'clock in the evening, working for a full thirteen or fourteen hours in the ninety-odd degree heat and beside the tense machines, their bodies were clearly in a state of extreme fatigue. But their spirits were not tired. Young female workers, carrying lunch boxes in one hand and towels in the other, chatted and laughed in groups of three or five, playfully pushing and shoving each other, running and skipping with light steps. Several men deliberately drilled into the ranks of the female workers: "Hey, big sister, let's go to the Great World tonight!"</p>
<p>"Little devil, if you bother me again, I'll eat you for dinner!"</p>
<p>Five or six female workers joined together to besiege the men, who laughed and ran away. Laughter, scolding, noisy footsteps—the gloomy factory street immediately showed a clear vibrancy. This was a kind of vibrancy that could never be found in works about workers written by the intellectual class.</p>
<p>Labor has become a kind of drudgery in this society, but this drudgery has not worn down the laborers. On the contrary, they have been forged even stronger in their painful experiences. Look, that team of young girls is lifting their sturdy legs and striding forward towards the sun behind the big chimney.</p>
<h3>A Pleasant Night</h3>
<p>— Wu Qiushan</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, as soon as evening arrived, the nearly full moon hung high above the buildings. A gentle breeze gradually dispersed the summer heat—what a rare summer moonlit night! We could no longer sit quietly in the house!</p>
<p>After dinner, Mr. E and I went to the Bund Bronze Statue Wharf, boarded the 8:30 PM evening ferry for a cool breeze, and cruised to Xidu, Qingning Temple, Donggou, and Gaoqiao, among other places.</p>
<p>The boat was decorated very elegantly. The driver's cabin was at the bow, followed by a small bar with brandy, beer, and soda water. The stern was shaded by a bamboo canopy, with colorful electric lights strung around the canopy like beaded curtains, emitting a soft light. We sat in chairs, drank beer, smoked cigarettes, told jokes, and listened to radio music. A cool breeze blew on our chests, and the sweltering heat was completely gone.</p>
<p>As the boat moved farther away from the city, we looked back and saw the lights on both banks reflected in the water, forming long golden snakes, undulating in a winding pattern. The ferryboats and embankment trees looked like a hazy shadow. After passing Xidu and Qingning Temple, we arrived at Donggou. The boat stopped there briefly, but few people got on. We could only see a cluster of red and green electric lights at the end of the long bridge. After leaving Donggou, we sailed along the long embankment, and Gaoqiao was soon in sight. After the boat stopped, we walked to the pier, hired a wheelbarrow, and walked into the quiet village. Under the faint moon and light mist, we saw vegetable plots, rice fields, plank bridges, and thatched houses along the way, just like scenes from a movie. After a while, the wooden-wheeled cart stopped in front of the Country Hotel. We got off the cart, walked into the hotel on the soft, velvety dirt road, sat in rattan chairs, and listened to the sound of insects like rain, which could not be heard in the city, and the distant barks of two or three dogs. It was truly a remote and pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the departure time of the boat was fixed, and we could not stay in the quiet countryside for long to breathe a little fresh air. After rushing back to Gaoqiao Wharf, the small steamer sailed back to Shanghai under the pure moonlight. Because it was returning, the boat traveled faster. When it docked at the Bronze Statue Wharf, the clock on the customs house was showing twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>Although it was only a hasty two or three hours of leisure, it was a precious and pleasant night for us who had no opportunity to leave Shanghai in the hot summer!</p>
<h3>Life and Machines (3)</h3>
<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>Looking at the star-studded sky, everyone thought of home: the green fields of early spring, the golden rice ears of late autumn, the yellow and green melons hanging in the green leaves of the melon shed... flashing through their numb minds like a dream; thus, a smile of reminiscence dotted their dry faces. However, everyone's brows gradually furrowed again, and what was now reflected in their eyes was an endless expanse of water, on the crests of the waves, the sun was kissing the treetops and rooftops exposed above the water; or a dry plain with not a single green plant, where dust danced in the air, and cracks opened in the ground; or the cold faces of the local defense forces clutching their guns and the tax collectors in their various guises. Close your eyes! Let the sky hide in the darkness, let the memories be buried in dreams! With their eyes closed, they thought of their own wives and other people's sisters. Their bodies were thin and weary, but their blood was not yet cold! Some sang erotic songs, played dominoes, and some whispered lewd words. In their eyes, the fire of lust flashed, and their red, swollen faces tightened like springs...</p>
<p>This was like eating rice while looking at a picture of salted fish, a mixture of immeasurable pain and bitterness in a vague and unrealistic satisfaction. As they swallowed their saliva, their sexual desire and their hunger were squeezed together. Those who were lying on their backs turned to their sides, and those who were lying on their sides rubbed their bellies. Opening their eyes, both hopes were as vague as the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>On the relatively clean floor next to the railing, two clean straw mats were spread out, and two foremen-looking men lay comfortably, listening to everyone's words with a slightly proud air.</p>
<p>"Hey! Ah Fa!" Suddenly, one of them flipped over from the straw mat, his eyes as if he were drunk.</p>
<p>"What is it?" The other one, his head resting on a small bundle, asked lazily.</p>
<p>"How much money do you have left?" A voice of urgency and desire. That person sat up and jiggled the small bundle in his hand: "What for? Jin Sheng." "I'm asking you, do you have enough?" "It's okay," Ah Fa lay back down again. "Enough to go to Yanziwo tomorrow or the day after."</p>
<p>"Pah! I'm asking you, is it enough to go to Minguo Road (Note: many low-class prostitutes in the nearby alleyways)?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" Frowning slightly. "Almost." "Then let's go!" Jin Sheng stood up. "Aren't you smoking tomorrow or the day after?"</p>

<h3>Financial Exchange, Forward Silver Closing Reverses Down, Standard Gold Rebounds to a High of Nine Yuan</h3>
<p>People's minds are uncertain, transactions are unusually stagnant.</p>
<p>The gold market saw a rebound yesterday because of the previous day's severe slump. Although overseas telegraphs showed rises in the price of silver in England and the United States, and the British and American exchange rates rose by 1.025,</p>
<p>the American and British exchange rates fell by 0.25. The closing price of forward silver on the Five Metal Exchange fell by varying amounts, from 0.015 to 0.025. In addition, American wheat fell by 0.05, stocks fell by a weak one yuan, and American cotton also fell by a small 0.07 pounds. This was quite unexpected. The opening of the raw market rebounded more than twenty yuan, even rising to 55-56 yuan. However, because the opening price was too high, it gradually fell back within 50 yuan. After the opening, it exceeded 50 yuan, and banks became reluctant. Moreover, the HSBC listing remained unchanged, causing further setbacks. However, banks continued to take advantage of the low prices to absorb, people's minds were uncertain, and transactions were not smooth. There were many short-term traders, people's minds became tired, and the exchange market was also tough and then broke the 40-yuan barrier. Banks saw low prices and absorbed again, and were able to pull up the market at noon. The market situation was sluggish for half a day, with no special changes. Suppliers continued to flood in because after covering their short positions overnight, they sold when they saw high prices. Although it rose, it still fell. The extra premium was added at 200 yuan. The swap spread for September/October was 6.5 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 849.5 yuan, a rebound of 15 yuan compared to the previous close. The commodity opened at 9 yuan. The opening exchange market quoted recent selling prices of British exchange at one shilling and three pence, and American exchange at 28 yuan. Richang, Dafa, Yongfu, Yifeng, and Yongtongyi all sold. Meifeng quoted October US dollars at 3.125, and November at 5.625, but soon announced it was difficult to sell, and retreated to within 6 yuan. Huabi, although buying November US dollars at 6.25, also found it difficult to sell. Yongfeng, Zhifeng, and Yong commodity sold again. It was rumored that the HSBC listing would not change, and it further fell from 7.8 jiao to 4 yuan. Yuanxing, Yongfu, Yurui, and Ruixing successively bought in. Mitsui bought November US dollars at 6.875, and it rose to 7.5 yuan. Yifeng, Yongheng, Yuchunyuan, Yonghongli, etc. continued to sell.

Yuanmao, Yongfu, Yuzhaofengchang, although advancing to 5.5 yuan, Hengxing, Shunli, Yuanheng commodity continued to sell. Pangen reluctantly sold November US dollars at 6.875, and it continued to fall. After entering, 0.75 was difficult to sell. Fuyu, Qianchang, Xiangzhaofengchang, etc. vigorously sold, and it fell to 40 yuan. Zhengchang, Zhifeng, Yonghengchang, Yong took advantage of the low price to buy. Macgarry took November US dollars at 0.75, and it rebounded to 2.5 yuan. The Dalian gang and Fuyu, Fuchang supplied the market. HSBC reluctantly sold November US dollars at 0.75, and nearly 0.8125 also became difficult to sell, and it fell to 8.7 jiao.

Macgarry bought December US dollars at 0.0625. Fuchang and Dadecheng advanced and stabilized. Mitsui and Huabi bought November US dollars again at 0.8125.

After entering, November US dollars at 0.8125 was difficult to settle and remained stable. Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Daxingyong jointly advanced. November at 0.75 also became difficult to obtain, and it rebounded to 45 yuan. Hengxing came up to supply. The noon closing retreated to 843.5 yuan, and the commodity was auctioned at the same price. Finally, it gradually rose to above 5 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 850 yuan, and the lowest was 837.2 jiao. As a result, it rebounded by 9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The price was announced because the HSBC Bank's US dollar listing remained unchanged, still at 27.875 yuan, corresponding to a standard gold price of 861 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 17 yuan less than the previous close, 9 yuan less than before. The registration price for this month was 855 yuan, for September 850 yuan, and for October 844 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 855 yuan. The extra premium was added at 200 yuan.

For the September/October swap, Wanxing paid Shunli and Qianchangxiang each 21 bars, at a price of 6.5 yuan. There were still 763 bars remaining for this month, and 2,548 bars for September.</p>
<p>Trading in the market became stagnant.

The total was 21,616 bars.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Recovers Tightly by 0.1875</h3>
<p>Difficult to Improve HSBC Listing</p>
<p>According to yesterday's overseas telegraphs, London's broad strip, both near and far, increased by 0.125, and the US Bank rose by 0.01. Although the British to US increased by 1.025, the US to British shrunk by 0.25. The forward silver closing price also fell by 0.015 to 0.025. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices of British exchange at one shilling and three pence, and US exchange at 28 yuan, which was flat for the British and tight for the US by 0.4375 compared to the previous close. After the opening, the banks immediately became reluctant, gradually loosening up. However, the HSBC listing, both shillings and US dollars, remained unchanged. After that, it remained hardened. The gold industry was more reluctant than buying. Finally, the banks still absorbed, slightly leveling out. By the noon closing, the recent selling prices were British exchange at one shilling and three pence, and US exchange at 28.25 yuan, which was flat for the British and tight for the US by 0.1875 compared to the previous close. The banking industry bought more than sold. The process fluctuated. Macgarry bought while HSBC and Nissho seemed to sell. Pangen brokers also supplied. Sassoon</p>

<h3>Weekend Silver Dollar Settlement Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar inflow and outflow situation was, as usual for Saturdays, slack. The interbank rate in the market remained at 0.06 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The Liu Tou added water initially at 0.02-0.03 yuan, and finally it was a white line. The looseness and abundance of the situation can be imagined. The turnover of check transactions was more than 3.7 million in the morning session, more than 1.2 million in new transactions, and more than 300,000 in the afternoon session. The turnover in the Small General Association was more than 500,000. The bank note inflow and outflow ranged from 300,000 to 400,000. The settlement was very simple. Foreign firms' settlement of checks amounted to more than 1.3 million in silver and more than 1.6 million in silver dollars. Special settlement amounted to more than 1.7 million in silver. Various goods, mortgage collateral, and miscellaneous items' settlement amounted to more than 3.4 million in silver and more than 3.3 million in silver dollars.

<h3>Guangdong Corner Falls Back Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Jiangnan small silver dollars remained at 846.5 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The amount of transactions in the morning session was 6,000, and in the afternoon session was 4,500. The Guangdong small silver dollars were 783.4 yuan in the morning session and 782.2 yuan in the afternoon session.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Rise More Than Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's market was relatively more active. Although there were no large-scale transactions, the swap trading of various gangs gradually became active. Retailers' inflow and outflow also slightly increased. Although there were purchases by the North Gang, the quantity was not large, so the market price also slightly increased. As the next week is the last week of this month's futures, the number of accounts in the exchange is still huge. In addition to a part prepared for delivery, the rest are floating long and short, and there will inevitably be a tendency to squeeze each other. The future of the market price should still have a relatively drastic change. Yesterday morning's opening was not lonely in swap trading. The North Gang also slightly took in, and the market price slightly rebounded by 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.3-0.4 yuan. Among them, due to the different choices of long-short swaps, the market price had a disparate overview. The closing price was still mostly swap, and the market price was still uneven, with more rises than falls, but only 0.1-0.2 yuan up and down. As a result, the market price rebounded by varying amounts from 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.4-0.5 yuan. Among them, the financial short-term this month was uniquely less by 0.015 yuan, which was due to the long swap. The total amount of transactions was 6,642,000 yuan, including 7,000 yuan in spot and 2,045,000 yuan in term salt tax, 690,000 in disarmament, 1,035,000 in 19 customs duties, 1,355,000 in 20-volume and 20-customs duties, and so on, ranging from tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Firm and Then Tired</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Friday (18th), the New York stock market was firm and active in the morning, but later, affected by the sharp fall in five grains, the market situation turned tired and stagnant. Looking at all aspects, the needs are still strong, so there is still a slightly higher possibility. The total transaction volume for the day was 2.09 million shares. Wheat fell sharply by 0.05 due to the lack of buyers and long selling. It is advisable to buy during the rebound. Cotton was also strong at first, but later, due to southern arbitrage and long selling, it fell back slightly. The Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 98.32 Down 0.98</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 48.55 Down 0.55 Twenty Utility Stocks 30.21 Down 0.71 Forty Bonds 87.91 Down 0.08</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn This Month's Yarn Enters the 80 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very tired because the actual demand is quiet, and the overseas situation is also in surplus. This month's yarn has already broken the 80 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Standard Yarn Also Drops More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Renbiao pre-market, the price of American cotton fell slightly, and there was a lack of buyers. Each month fell by 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, and 0.9 jiao. The afternoon situation was greatly alarmed, and the longs painfully cut their positions. The current month broke the 80 yuan mark, and the far months fell by 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 48,500 bales.

<h3>August Chen Cotton Gained Uniquely in a Squeeze</h3>
<p>There Will be Increased Special Certificates Next Week</p>
<p>The cotton market is falling sharply, with American cotton in a bleak situation, and the yarn market is declining. The climate is harmonious, and a bumper harvest of new cotton is expected. Manufacturers, with the yarn sales declining, are very indifferent to raw materials. However, the long positions of Chen cotton in August organized a squeeze, and all the more than 10,000 dan of textured cotton were sold to foreign firms. On the one hand, the price was raised and purchased in the exchange, gaining 1.75 yuan uniquely.</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Falls Tiredly</h3>
<p>The Zhengbiao pre-market opening, the market atmosphere was flat, and foreign cotton was weak. Each month fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. However, the current month rose by one yuan. In the afternoon, the current month rose again by 0.75 yuan, and the far months fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 123,600 dan. It was found that Suilong sold 5,100 dan, Xincheng 2,900 dan, Changfeng 5,500 dan, Gengfeng 2,800 dan, Shenchang 2,600 dan, and Yuanxingchang 3,000 dan. Senkang bought 9,100 dan, Dachang 4,100 dan, Yuanda 5,000 dan, and Mingde 2,400 dan. The closing price is as follows:</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Market Mostly Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market situation initially rose due to good news from Liverpool, and then fell due to weakness on Wall Street. In the end, it was firm due to some short covering. As a result, the spot price fell by 0.05 pounds, and the futures price fell by 0.06 pounds to 0.13 pounds. The Liverpool cotton market spot price rose by 20 points, and the futures price rose by 23 points. The Egyptian cotton spot price rose by 20 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to good American cotton short covering. As a result, Pingal rose by 3 rupees, Aomula rose by 3.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 3.5 rupees.

<h3>New Cotton Suppressed but Still Rises Last Week American Cotton</h3>
<p>The New York dispatch on the 18th reported on the cotton market during the week, saying that the cotton market fell sharply last week, due to a large number of long positions being closed and increased arbitrage. The old long positions were obviously alarmed by the collapse of the grain market. Good new cotton, about to be listed, caused anxiety, which was also one of the reasons for the price drop. Most of the painfully cut positions have not yet been cleared. Moreover, a large number of sales in the west are feared to be for the protection of their stored wheat, because the price of wheat has continued to fall, so the amount of goods cannot be urgently cleared in the grain market for a while. Later, short covering was more active, and there were signs of wheat stabilizing again. The theory of inflation also revived, so the postponement of the plan was due to the inability of several important industries to implement it for a while. Cotton transactions were limited, and people's minds were uneven, because the raw material market was unstable. At the same time, sporadic business would only move after the price increased.</p>
<h3>Japanese Osaka Inventory of Yarn Exceeds 100,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Japan's inventory of yarn has gradually increased since this year, and has become even more so recently. The total inventory of Osaka and Kobe at the end of July has exceeded 100,000 bales. In addition, the total in Tokyo and Nagoya reached 130,000 bales. Compared with January of this year, the number has doubled. According to the survey by the Textile Federation, the monthly inventory is as follows: (unit: bales)</p>
<p>Month Osaka and Kobe Total in Tokyo and Nagoya</p>
<p>January 56,082 61,281 February 68,230 76,620 March 85,680 98,472 April 87,754 103,697 May 88,385 104,133 June 95,063 113,074 July 106,283 130,237</p>
<h3>Grain Thin Rice Scarce Prices Rise by More Than One Corner</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of grain in South Shanghai was more than ten numbers, and both retail and wholesale were slack. The situation was quiet. Fortunately, the goods were scarce in recent days, and the market was still tight. However, the Chang Gang, Su Tong Gang white japonica rice, and Du Yangjian rice had more goods arriving, and only fresh specials slightly raised their prices by a few corners. The medium and sub-grades were not honored or shamed. Although the South Port thick rice was short of goods, it was stable due to sluggish demand. Thin rice, on the other hand, had no trace of Qingjiao Gang's source, and various gangs were also sparse. Therefore, as soon as the package demand moved, the price increased by a few corners, even though the number was two or three hundred packages. The sellers were still unwilling to let go, and the market was quite good. Bian Yuan continued to fall, and Changdong's new station kept the original plate.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of grain in North Shanghai was 35 numbers from various routes under the river. The demand for various goods in the market was still good. The north japonica rice was next stable, and the medium and sub-grades were tight by a few cents. The prices of early thin rice, Yang Dujian rice, new guest tip, and Dongxin japonica rice were stable. The port tip stood up, and the price of Chen Guest tip was tight. However, Bian Yuan's demand was flat, and the price was slightly down by one corner.</p>
<h3>Hunan Early Rough Rice First Batch Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>"One Hundred Packages Have Not Been Sold"</p>
<p>Although yesterday, the foreign guest and Xian guest gangs had demand, the price of foreign rice was high and unprofitable. They had a good impression of Xian guest rice, but because new goods were lacking and the old goods were about to run out, they were unable to handle it smoothly. Hunan old warehouse rice was originally the only patron of Zhejiang Road, but there is no arrival at the moment. The Min gang welcomed low-priced new rice, so only the Ningbo gang handled 247 packages of Hunan mechanical oil Chen rice, priced at 7 yuan. There were no other transactions.</p>
<p>Hunan's early rice harvest this year was very good. It is expected that the late rice and a small number of second and third crops will also have bumper harvests. Therefore, the market price of new grain has fallen slightly to 1.34 yuan, and even high-quality Chen grain is close to 1.5 yuan. At present, the province is seeking to transport and sell to various provinces in the north and south to be used as economic activities. However, the transportation and transfer are very troublesome, and there are production and sales tax passports, education donations, inspection fees, and all kinds of emerging donations and taxes similar to the Lijin. Therefore, every stone of mechanical rice transported to Shanghai must increase by about 2 yuan, and even the production areas with convenient access must also increase by 1 yuan and several corners. Therefore, although the production price is low, there is still no large amount arriving in the market for sale.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the first batch of Hunan early rough new rice has arrived in Shanghai, totaling 200 packages. The cost is 5 yuan. After the samples were taken out, both the Min and Zhejiang gangs inquired, but they have not been sold for some reason. As for the price, it should be around 5.2 yuan according to the market price.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Slightly Sold Off by Factories</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning and afternoon, the various months showed an unbearable situation. As the quotation of foreign wheat was in line with expectations, Chicago fell by 1.65 yuan, and Canada fell by more than 0.78 yuan. Therefore, after the opening price, the market atmosphere was particularly flat and soft. Afterwards, due to the slight selling by the factories, the long-term was even weaker. Therefore, each plate gradually fell. According to the current situation of actual sales, the future is particularly pessimistic. For example, in Tianjin alone, the inventory reached more than 2 million, and the daily sales volume was only about 20,000 packages, less than one-third of previous years. The inventory in this port and the Yangtze River area is also considerable. Therefore, if there is no large-scale sale, there is little hope. As a result, this month was less by 0.05 yuan than the previous day, September fell by 0.01 yuan, October fell by 0.0125 yuan, November and December fell by 0.01 yuan, and January fell by 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Activity Advances Term Wheat</h3>
<p>Spot Wheat Delivery is Smooth and Special High-Quality Goods Remain Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the term wheat market was slightly flat and tired in the morning after the opening. The quotation of foreign wheat was Chicago down 1.65 yuan, and Canada down more than 0.78 yuan. Therefore, when the price was opened, people's minds were slightly tired. However, although there is no way to rise at the moment, the mainland brokers and this port's brokers still think of holding hard when foreign wheat has not arrived. Therefore, the selling households were scarce, and the market stopped. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, each plate's transactions were quite excited, because there were outside customers who were active again. Each plate had purchases, so the asking price gradually increased, especially in January. As a result, August and September were unchanged, October was good by 0.01 yuan, November was slightly less by 0.01 yuan, December was unchanged, and January was better by 0.05 yuan than the morning closing price. The spot wheat market's delivery is smooth, and the special high-quality goods are still stable. The middle and sub-grades are average. Kai Wuhe Wheat is 3.88 yuan, second grade 0.75 yuan. Yao 麦 is 3.82 yuan, second grade 0.8 yuan. Suqian Wheat is 3.8 yuan, second grade 0.78 yuan. Suzhou Wheat is 3.65 yuan, Gaoyou Wheat is 3.6 yuan, Danyang Wheat is 3.57 yuan, Changzhou Wheat is 3.57 yuan, second grade 0.54 yuan, Liuhe Wheat is 3.52 yuan, second grade 0.47 yuan, Baoying Wheat is 3.47 yuan, second grade 0.42 yuan, Yangzhou Wheat is 3.46 yuan, second grade 0.42 yuan, totaling 9,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>New Soybeans Show Mixed Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Changzhou Niupi Yellow Soybeans had good sales. Both Guangsha Ningbo and this street inquired, and more than 1,000 bags were sold. Therefore, the source was depleted as soon as it arrived, and the market continued to trend upwards. However, Jiujiang soybeans fell by 0.04-0.05 yuan due to poor access. The total market transaction was 700 bags, which were distributed by this street and the Ningbo gang. It was heard that there were still more than 3,000 bags of soybeans in stock.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Falls Again by 0.05, Dutch Red is Tighter</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's trend was still tired, as the standard gold did not fluctuate much. The union's divided plate 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods called 20.9 yuan, and there was no receiver for the original plate. There were some transactions at 0.85 yuan. The Dutch red market's trend was tight. High-quality KD brand was called 16.8 yuan, and PK brand was divided 16.67 yuan. Zhonghua Guohua's own factory's cotton white fell by 0.05 yuan, with the top number being 20.25 yuan, number one 20.005 yuan, number two 19.85 yuan, number three 19.6 yuan, and number four 19.45 yuan. Taikoo sugar was unchanged. B brand was still 21.45 yuan. The number plate only opened by the Chao Gang with 90 pieces of 篓 Zhuang条 Qing, priced at 10.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea in Zhejiang Province: Early Autumn Cocoons to Enter the Market</h3>
<p>(Linping Autumn Silkworms Early to Cluster) In the Linping area, silkworms emerge earliest. In Gaosi and Sanbao, silkworm larvae have developed smoothly, and the early batches have already begun clustering to form cocoons. Preparations are underway for weighing and trading. However, there is a shortage of mulberry leaves, and their price is exceptionally high, requiring about three yuan per load.</p>
<p>(Rayon Market Exchange Rate Weak) Due to tight foreign exchange, rayon prices have weakened. Sales have slightly increased. Yesterday, shipments from Sichuan, Hubei, and other regions included 30 cases of Jardine Matheson's No. 1 and No. 2 Flying Horse brands for current and forward delivery. Prices ranged from 167.25 yuan to 161.75 yuan net, a decrease of 0.50 yuan compared to previous prices.</p>
<p>(Overseas Silk Prices Continue to Rise Firmly) The U.S. government is about to implement inflation, causing prices to rise sharply. The New York raw silk market has also risen accordingly. However, silk weavers have ample silk inventories on hand and remain cautious. Telegrams from Shanghai are still scarce, and the market atmosphere is calm. Yesterday, the market saw only a few transactions to replenish shortages. Xinfu and others imported 20 bales of white factory silk and 5 bales of yellow silk, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<h3>Zhen Mei and Gong Xi Teas Experience Brisk Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhen Mei and Gong Xi green teas from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other regions experienced brisk trading. However, Zhen Mei tea was mostly purchased by upper and middle-grade dealers, while lower-grade teas remained stagnant. The Gong Xi market was the firmest, with Russian cooperative organizations and foreign firms showing strong interest due to scarce supplies, resulting in immediate sales with minimal stockpiling. Market conditions were also firmer than before. British and French firms also showed strong demand for needle and pearl teas, but with limited inventory, trading was quite quiet.</p>
<h3>A Flood of New Piece Goods and Woolens Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, woolens in the Woolen Goods Association showed good trends. There was still demand from Sichuan and Northern Jiangsu. New goods shipped in May and June have been arriving in large quantities recently. Imports of Western-style suiting flannels are especially numerous. There are 600 cases of cavalry twill, with significant arrivals from British and German trading companies. The trading companies claim that another large batch of woolens will arrive by the end of the month. In total, about 2,000 pieces of new woolen goods are expected to arrive in Shanghai in August, with a quarter being heavy winter goods, two quarters being autumn goods, and the remaining tenth being auxiliary items such as feather yarn and sleeve lining.</p>

<h3>Who Should China Emulate to Transform Itself?</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>In the dozen or so years since the end of the European War, how many new countries have emerged in this world? Among these countries, besides the many small countries in Central and Southern Europe that gained independence from the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, there are others that were known as great powers but rose up to seek survival under the pressure of defeat. To date, the countries that have achieved the status of a new nation include Turkey and Germany. Those whose domestic political weaknesses were increasingly exposed due to the impact of the Great War, and who gained a higher international standing through domestic revolution that refreshed the world's perception, include Soviet Russia, Italy, and China. When we look at these countries, although the means and methods of reforming domestic affairs and resisting foreign powers differ, the goal of seeking independent liberation from an oppressed environment and striving for national survival is the same. Now, Turkey, Germany, Italy, and Russia, under different circumstances and using different methods, have achieved the results they sought. Only our old and large China, despite the bloody revolutions of the years 1926, 1927, and 1928, is still lingering in this process of continued oppression. Not to mention the loss of cities and territories in diplomacy, the situation of domestic corruption, as can be seen from the documents announced by the officials of the Supervisory Yuan over the years, has at least made no progress compared to before. So, how is it that other countries can break out of a new situation from the environment of diplomatic oppression and domestic disorder, while our China cannot? This is a question we want to discuss with readers today.</p>
<p>Some say that this cannot be compared in this way because China's history, geography, and socio-economic background are all different from those of other small countries, not to mention that the backgrounds of Turkey, Germany, Italy, and Russia are also different from each other. However, the key point we should pay attention to regarding this issue is not to seek answers from the vast and complex differences in background, but to study from a common principle the path China should follow in the future for reference and emulation.</p>
<p>What is the principle of revival for Turkey, Germany, Italy, and Russia? In short, it is that the majority of the people have a desire to seek national independence and create national rejuvenation. From this emotional desire can generate great action. A country that is oppressed will never produce a great spirit of resistance and strong action if its people do not have the courage to seek individual survival and the ardent emotion of seeking national independence and equality. The Turks after the war were filled with the fear of national subjugation and also possessed ardent patriotic emotions, and then they had the ability to recover lost territories, defeat the Greeks, and make the great powers dare not look at them directly. Although Italy was a victor in the Great War, its backward production, underdeveloped industry, and the collapse of the parliamentary system made the majority of the people unable to bear the pain of this broken situation, which eventually led to Mussolini's success in reviving Italy. The situation in Germany after the war was far worse than in Italy, but the harsh environment was able to create a greater spirit of resistance and ability to act. We see the Germans' arduous and extraordinary struggle after the war, which can prove the correctness of this theory. Looking at the great reforms in the new Russia after the war, we understand even more the origins of the spirit of resistance and the ability to act! When it comes to the corruption of the old Russian domestic affairs and the underdevelopment of education, both are even worse than China's, and as for the backwardness of industrial production, it is even more insignificant compared to Germany and Italy, so the destruction and success of the Russian system after the Great War was far more intense and thorough than those of Turkey, Germany, and Italy!</p>
<p>If we want to ask who China's future should emulate, we only need to estimate how our majority of compatriots feel about the courage to save themselves and the emotion of seeking national independence. If there is such courage and emotion, then it can succeed no matter who it emulates. If it does not exist or is very weak, then it can only be slaughtered by others.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>The Old Monster</h3>
<p>— Wu Sheng</p>
<p>Pharmacy Clerk</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock in the evening, it was</p>
<p>the time when most traditional Chinese pharmacies routinely closed</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The clerks in the Chinese pharmacy, especially those in the medicinal herbs department, worked all day from 7:30 AM to 9:00 PM. If business was slow, it was still manageable, but otherwise, they had to run around like racehorses in the store all day, dispensing prescriptions. Therefore, most clerks in the medicinal herbs department felt extremely exhausted and needed rest after a whole day of physical and mental labor.</p>
<p>But not Old Zhou. He always told people, "The busier I am, the better! I'm happier!" Therefore, his colleagues called him the old monster, a person without awareness. But I believe Old Zhou's words were not pretentious but sincere. His two simple sentences contained endless sorrow, which the young colleagues could not comprehend!</p>
<p>Old Zhou meant that the busier he was, the more he could forget everything that troubled him.</p>
<p>Closing the doors, stopping work, Old Zhou felt that this time was the most annoying and painful. He would think of all sorts of problems: "Five hundred yuan in outstanding loans; his eldest son wandering in a foreign land; he himself over fifty years old, with a monthly salary of only sixteen yuan . . ." Once these problems were recalled, they would linger in his mind. He sighed! He cried! He could not go to bed until after ten o'clock every night.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, he received three letters asking for money in a row. Old Zhou's heart was already unbearably bitter. Who knew that tonight his nephew Afu would come to demand payment again, saying as soon as he opened his mouth: "One hundred and thirty-two yuan and eighty cents, please repay me half by the end of the year!" He was hospitable and stole time from his busy schedule, avoiding the manager's eyes and ears, to send Afu away. He agreed to repay a quarter within the year.</p>
<p>The manager went back to the mansion in a chauffeured car, and the colleagues also went to sleep with smiles on their faces. In an instant, only his figure remained in the store. As usual, he took a cup of tea and walked to the place where the doctor diagnosed patients during the day, sipping tea and pondering.</p>
<p>He felt a throbbing pain in his right leg. He lifted it up and saw that it was very swollen. He lifted his left foot and saw that it was equally swollen and painful. This was obviously the result of overwork and walking all day. At the same time, he found two holes in his socks.</p>
<p>By the time he went to bed, it was nearly eleven o'clock. He did not fall asleep until after twelve o'clock. He vaguely felt that all his debts had been repaid, his son had a job, and he was peacefully enjoying his twilight years at home. However, this happy scene was shattered by the apprentice's urgent call. He woke up. He was still Old Zhou, who owed five hundred yuan! Old Zhou, who was working for a monthly salary of sixteen yuan! The apprentice told him that it was already seven-thirty and that the manager was about to arrive.</p>
<p>So, he hurriedly put on his clothes, hastily got out of bed, forgot all the pain, and stored away all the sorrow to go to work.</p>

<h3>The Amateur Café: Scooping a Handful from the Heads of the Masses</h3>
<p>— Ms. Tian Lei</p>
<p>The boss of the cigarette company says that smoking can lead to wealth. Empty shells, ten of them, exchange for a coupon, with the hope of winning ten thousand yuan. The bank manager has launched "prize savings." A deposit of thirty yuan offers thirty-two chances to win a prize, with the possibility of becoming a major capitalist. In addition, there are "aviation prize tickets" at ten yuan each, with a grand prize of five hundred thousand yuan and over five thousand small prizes (it is said that for the sake of widespread distribution, it has now been changed to one yuan per strip, which can benefit many more common people!). These many prizes are paid out in full, hard cash added on hard cash. As long as you, the poor kid, have a little background, or a certain bone grows properly, or your horoscope is good, you might immediately sit in a car and get rich. Look! Didn't the winner of the "aviation prize ticket" already take the five hundred thousand? Aren't the winners of the tobacco company's coupons still posting their photos in the newspaper these days? Everyone has a way out! Hurry up and smoke cigarettes, join "prize savings," and buy "aviation prize tickets"!</p>
<p>However, I cannot help but have some doubts in my heart. After all, only a few people win prizes. Even if they win, the prize money is plundered from the masses, and most people are still wandering on the road to disappointment, and perhaps even developing morbidity due to disappointment (according to reports, several people went to the prize ticket office in distress after not winning aviation prize tickets). I always feel that this "prize business" is similar to gambling with a commission. The gambling losses do not concern the bookmaker. In any case, the commission can always be steadily obtained. Even if you lose everything and jump into the Huangpu River, it is a "white death." In any case, the winners and the bookmaker have already put the foreign money into their own pockets!</p>
<p>With the prevalence of "prize businesses," the money that friends who "sell their blood and sweat" and "racking their brains" have worked so hard to earn will be squeezed out by the bosses, managers, and gentlemen. I have no name for the "prize business," so I call it: "Scooping a handful from the heads of the masses!"</p>
<p>Amateur Sports</p>
<h3>Improved Weightlifting Object</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiyuan</p>
<p>Weightlifting (HoabyLiftEcercise) is the most effective method for developing human muscles. Weightlifting objects, like what we call stone drums (also known as fairy burdens or stone burdens), are the same.</p>
<p>Because of a lack of muscle, the human body becomes uneven in fatness, and the healthy "beauty of physique" disappears. To make muscles develop, the most effective way is to perform strenuous exercise. Weightlifting is a type of strenuous exercise that can improve the ailments of being overweight and underweight, and transform the body into a strong and powerful torso with moderate fatness.</p>
<p>But why is it necessary to improve weightlifting objects? Could it be that they have something unreasonable or incomplete about them? No! What I call "improvement" here does not refer to the essence of all weightlifting objects, but rather to a new method that adapts to the needs of people who face various difficulties in terms of status or economy due to weightlifting. However, this new method still follows the principles of old weightlifting objects and makes some "improvements." This "improved weightlifting object" is extremely simple to make. See Figure 1:</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>A Coarse rope (hanging from</p>
<p>the ceiling or a hook on the wall.</p>
<p>The distance in the middle is</p>
<p>about three feet.)</p>
<p>B Bamboo pole or wooden stick</p>
<p>(about four feet long, inserted</p>
<p>(Figure 1) into the A rope, the height</p>
<p>level with the chest.)</p>
<p>C Weights (two cloth bags,</p>
<p>each filled with sand, mud, or</p>
<p>rocks, or old books and newspapers,</p>
<p>anything heavy can be used,</p>
<p>hanging at both ends of the bamboo</p>
<p>pole or wooden stick. The weight</p>
<p>can be increased or decreased</p>
<p>according to individual strength.)</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>When exercising, first stand upright and support the bamboo pole or wooden stick with both hands (not holding it with the thumbs extended); then slowly lift it upward (the legs and knees cannot be bent during lifting), and then slowly lower it, as shown in Figures 2 and 3:</p>
<p>Continue to exercise in this up-and-down motion until you can no longer lift it (do not try to push through), then rest and lift again; before long, the arms will swell up. If you practice every day without interruption or neglect, before long, the arm strength will gradually increase, and the muscles will naturally develop.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>(1) It is advisable to take deep breaths, walk, or jump rope before weightlifting.</p>
<p>(2) Do not lift weights after a full meal.</p>
<p>(3) Do not stand in a windy place when sweating due to increased body heat after weightlifting.</p>
<p>(4) Do not overexercise. It is best to set a specific time each day to lift weights several times.</p>
<p>If this "improved weightlifting object" is considered "unsightly" when installed indoors, that's okay! In less than a minute, you can take it all down, including the rope, bamboo pole (or wooden stick), and weights; you can also install it immediately when you want to practice; the procedure is very simple, quick, and there is no annoyance, trouble, or inconvenience. If you don't believe it, try it!</p>

<h3>Wanderers on Earth</h3>
<p>— Lu Hai</p>
<p>Overseas Seamen, Chinese Seamen</p>
<p>Seamen: On a ship, everyone except passengers is collectively called a seaman. However, because of the different economic classes within, they can be divided into two types: upper-class seamen and lower-class seamen. The upper class is the small number of people who control the entire ship's power, such as the captain, chief mate, engineer, and foreman. The lower class is the majority of the ship's crew, such as sailors, stokers, and waiters. However, most or all of our great Republic of China people are lower-class seamen, and those upper-class seamen are always left for foreigners to be. Sometimes we call them noble employees instead of seamen. What I am talking about here is the general life of lower-class seamen:</p>
<p>The procedure for becoming a seaman is to first get to know the "She Zi Sha" (i.e., the foreman in the contracting system), and then try to curry favor by giving him a gift (preferably foreign money), requesting him to pay attention to job opportunities. After he (She Zi Sha) receives your gift, it is truly effective. Within a week, he will guarantee you a job on a large river ship (i.e., a ship sailing to foreign countries, such as Blue Funnel Line, Gilan Line, Empress Line, etc.), and your job position can be resolved.</p>
<p>When you are introduced by "She Zi Sha" to work on a ship of a certain shipping company and travel the big rivers, it is stipulated in the six-month contract (i.e., a single trip ship) that the shipping company will issue a "Pai Shi Bo" (certificate). The monthly salary is twenty-three yuan. Before the ship sails, you must first pay two months of "Wan Shi" (advance salary). It is completely taken away by "She Zi Sha" as a reward for introducing the job.</p>
<p>Once you get on the ship, you have to taste the life of a wanderer on the waves for at least six months. However, what about the living expenses of your parents, wives, and children at home who rely on you for sustenance? The two months of "Wan Shi" have already been given to "She Zi Sha" as a reward, and you have not a penny in your hand. But at that time, you don't need to worry. "She Zi Sha" will naturally show you some "mercy" and help you solve the difficulty. So he smiles at you and says, "Do you need money to take home to use?" "Well, I'll lend you thirty yuan, a big one and a small one, icing on the cake." ("A big one and a small one" means borrowing one yuan, with a monthly interest of one dime, and "icing on the cake" means compounding interest.) At that time, even if you don't want to borrow, you can't help but borrow!</p>
<p>After borrowing thirty yuan from "She Zi Sha," you put some of it at home to buy rice, and the rest you buy some cooked tobacco and peace medicine to bring on the ship to prevent headaches and fever.</p>
<p>Thus, the life of a seaman begins, and the wandering life on earth "today here, tomorrow elsewhere" begins.</p>
<p>Every day, before the sky dawns, you have to get up. After eating the so-called breakfast (actually rice porridge), you carry the thick canvas hose to wash the deck, grind the cabin surface, scrub the copper, paint, tidy up the anchor chain, and climb the masts to dismantle screws. If you are a little slow, a piece of foreign ham will be sent to your buttocks. "Na Ba Wen's" green eyes will stare at you and scold you loudly. You simply cannot be lazy, and even eating a mouthful of cooked tobacco is envied. On the deck, you can't stop for the whole morning. Lunch starts at half-past twelve. Like feeding pigs, eight people sit at a table, squatting around on the deck of the cabin. The dishes are mostly cabbage fried with cabbage, pork broth with a strange smell, and two pieces of salted fermented bean curd. If you want to say something about the poor food, "She Zi Sha's" detective, the foreman's confidant, will give you a slap, two slaps, or even stop your work.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, you still return to the upper deck to work, and sometimes you have to loosen the sampan and paint the side of the ship. If you "accidentally" fall into the "salty field," no one is responsible. It's just that the Republic of China has one less person. In the evening, in the pigsty-like "Fushi Long" (front of the ship), thirty-two bunks are set up, enough to sleep thirty-two crew members. A five-candlepower electric light. Because of the confined air, the room is filled with a stench that makes people want to vomit.</p>
<p>After eating dinner, it's half-past six, and the day's work is over. "Na Ba Wen" (foreman), who has a great way to make money, holds his money-making evening party, turning on five or six lamps (opium lamps), "Shang Bai" (opium name) at four cents per round, "Chen You" (opium name) at two cents per yuan, and setting up three or four tables for Fan Tan, Pai Gow, mahjong, Dou Niu, etc. "Na Ba Wen" personally takes the field to recruit "interested parties." Opium can be bought on credit, and gambling money can also be owed. If you don't participate in smoking or gambling, then don't expect to work on the ship on your next trip.</p>
<p>Thus, six months on a single-trip ship are spent like this. When the ship returns to Tangshan (i.e., returns to China), everyone goes to "Xie La Xian" (Eastern Seamen's Association) to collect their wages, totaling ninety-two yuan. In addition to repaying "She Zi Sha's" loan and interest of fifty-four yuan, you also have to repay fifteen or sixteen yuan to the foreman on the ship, leaving a total of twenty-three or twenty-four yuan. However, when the ship has not yet entered the port, your wife and parents are already waiting on the dock for your "successful" return, so that they can pay off the debts of the past few months!</p>
<h3>International Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Yizhong</p>
<p>Foreign Staff and Chinese Clerks in a Big Organization</p>
<p>A certain large organization occupies a very important position in China's business circles. Since undergoing a reform last year, it has eliminated many long-standing malpractices and improved its operations somewhat. However, there is one thing here that we do not understand:</p>
<p>I remember that last year, in order to tighten finances, the organization laid off a large number of employees. X branch laid off fifty or sixty people. Many of these people had served in the organization for decades or several years. According to regulations, they should have been given a certain amount of severance pay upon dismissal. Initially, the organization's authorities refused to issue it. Later, after they petitioned many times, begging and pleading, they finally received one month's severance pay. However, waiting for this severance pay had already cost them more than two months of expenses. As a result, everyone left with their heads hanging in dejection.</p>
<p>This year, three foreigners, foreign staff, are about to retire (the organization's authorities dare not dismiss them). Each of them received 20,000 yuan for travel expenses and 30,000 yuan for severance pay, totaling 150,000 yuan for the three of them. Last year, the salaries of dozens of petitioning Chinese clerks, even for several years, did not amount to 150,000 yuan. But in order to fill the pockets of the foreign dignitaries, they disregarded the unemployment of dozens of Chinese commoners and the starvation of hundreds of people. The strangest thing is that one of the three foreigners, after receiving 50,000 yuan, did not leave but continued to serve as usual, receiving several thousand taels of silver in salary each month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in addition to laying off many junior employees and increasing the number of senior employees, the organization also canceled the annual double salary and annual salary increase for junior employees. The junior employees were receiving "special favors," causing everyone to complain incessantly. It seems that Chinese people should suffer, are all useless, and should be laid off. Only hiring foreign dignitaries can be considered competent. Therefore, each department hired a foreign dignitary with a salary of 2,400 taels per month, and they also needed to live in Western-style houses. The nominal reason was to reform operations for a period of three months, but it has now been six months, and the operations are still the same. A few Chinese clerks are still working hard there, with no changes whatsoever, and no guidance or contributions from the foreign dignitaries have been seen. On the other hand, the organization recruited a batch of trainees who only receive a stipend of 20 yuan each during the training period, without food or accommodation. The training period was originally set for three months, but it has now been five months, and there is still no movement. Two people who didn't know any better went to inquire, and in addition to being rebuffed, after a few days, the organization's bureau told them: "Now, your training period is over. The bureau has no place to accommodate you. Please seek other employment!"</p>

<h3>Accident Insurance</h3>
<p>— Gao Shiqi</p>
<p>A rickshaw puller uses the strength of his legs to run, pulling the rickshaw on the road. Suddenly, a car driving very fast comes towards him. He is momentarily flustered and quickly swerves, causing a collision with a nearby vehicle or pedestrian, resulting in the rickshaw overturning and people falling over. A plasterer stands on the edge of the roof repairing tiles, or a handyman stands on the windowsill of a tall building wiping glass. Carelessly, they lose their footing and fall. Workers in factories are often hit by machinery. Firefighters and blacksmiths are often burned by fire. Accidents involving trains, cars, and trams are frequently heard of. Such dangers are all unexpected, and the injuries resulting from these dangers are collectively referred to as accident insurance.</p>
<p>In China, we have never paid attention to the health of workers. There is no registration of workers' illnesses, and statistics on accident insurance cannot be calculated. Although the number of workers accounts for a large part of the national population, this part of the population already lives in extreme poverty, and the number of accidental injuries they encounter is countless. Enthusiastic public health advocates are urged to pay close attention to the prevention of accident insurance.</p>
<p>The main causes of accident insurance are partly due to environmental hazards and partly due to one's own lack of neurological sensitivity, leading to the greatest misfortune. The main points are listed below:</p>
<p>A. Environmental Hazards: (1) Fire Hazards, all dangers of being burned by fire, such as the environment in which firefighters and blacksmiths work; (2) Water Hazards, the danger of drowning, such as the environment in which fishermen and boatmen work; (3) Electrical Hazards, the danger of electric shock, such as the environment of electricians; (4) Vehicle Hazards, all dangers arising from vehicles, such as the environment of workers on cars, trams, and trains; (5) Machinery Hazards, dangers when managing and using machinery; (6) Fall Hazards, such as the danger when constructing and repairing houses; (7) Mining Hazards, various dangers when working in mines; (8) Livestock Hazards, the danger when raising livestock and wild animals; (9) Cargo Hazards, the danger when transporting heavy goods; (10) Chemical Hazards, such as the dangers in gunpowder and chemical factories.</p>
<p>B. Lack of Neurological Sensitivity: (1) Illness, people who are sick are generally not mentally healthy; (2) Fatigue; (3) Drunkenness; (4) Poor eyesight; (5) Poor hearing; (6) Illiteracy, illiterate people often do not pay attention to danger warnings; (7) Carelessness; (8) Unsuitable work, if a worker's ability is not suitable for the job they are doing, then dangerous events are more likely to occur; (9) Excessive haste, it has been estimated that a large number of accidental injuries in factories occur between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., which is due to the excessive haste of work during this time; (10) Child Labor, child laborers are more likely to suffer accidental injuries than adult workers.</p>
<p>Accident insurance is a great misfortune for workers, but it can be prevented. Now that we know all its causes, we can think of various ways to stop or avoid it. On the one hand, we must transform the environment to reduce its dangers, and on the other hand, we must guide workers to be careful and avoid putting themselves in danger. The methods for preventing accident insurance are listed below: (1) Sense of Responsibility: Employers or factory owners must have a sense of responsibility for protecting workers in all respects; (2) Worker Education: Employers must provide workers with self-defense education; (3) Law: The government must enact special laws for the protection of workers; (4) Warnings: Obvious warnings or slogans must be displayed in all dangerous places; (5) Insurance Equipment: Dangerous places must be equipped with insurance mechanisms, such as safety barriers for machines; (6) Mental Health: Use psychological testing methods to determine whether the distribution of workers and their work is appropriate; (7) Time: Reduce working hours to prevent workers from becoming too fatigued; (8) Wages: Increase wages to improve workers' living standards and enhance their work spirit;</p>
<p>(9) Research: Based on factual investigations, study the work situation and strive for improvement; (10) Worker Compensation: Workers who unfortunately suffer accidental injuries should have the right to compensation, the amount of which depends on the severity of the injury and the family's circumstances.</p>
