<p>時評</p>
<h3>當前之嚴重問題</h3>
<p>忍</p>
<p>當熱河陷落之初。一般淺見者流。以及心存苟安者。類都認爲東北四省。日人兹已整個攫去。其慾望應亦已滿足。今後庶幾可以暫停其侵略之步武。俾吾人獲得一時之苟安。然而不旋踵間。灤東即又告陷落。長城各口亦被突破。暴敵侵略之鐵蹄。已實際進入長城以内。瞰平津。攬華北。耽耽虎視。野心正無止戢。此嶄然如鐵之事實。應亦足以擊破一般苟安旦夕者之幻夢。吾人蓋可以斷言在日本帝國主義者預定之大陸政策下。我民族如不能奮起鬥爭。而惟坐待宰割。則即欲偏安亦决不可得。</p>
<p>自九一八以來。日人對我侵略之一貫策略。爲「一弛一張。弛者所以使」</p>
<p>我暫忘苦楚。其張也。則操刀立割。毫不猶豫。自遼吉黑三省淪亡以後。榆關之攫取。以至最近灤東之攻佔。無不爲此「一弛一張」政策之運用。彼蓋已深切了解我國一部人之弱點。或僅有五分鐘之熱情。無持久之毅力。或則存因循觀望苟安一時之心理。且又全體散漫。不能如臂使指。靈活運用。更復互相牽掣。故不可操之過急。伹當徐以圖之。從容以制其命。我民族今日日處於死神威脅之下。而竟安然無所感覺。痛楚未定。歡唱又作。幕上燕子。曾不知危。是則豈僅可哀。尤爲可痛。</p>
<p>吾人默察當前陳列於眼前之現實。亡國之象徵。殆無不畢具。舉國上下。惟知空談。言抗日則揎袖攘臂。言救國則激昻慷慨。人各有見。不相爲謀。演說辯論。則若罄一切悲壯激昻之字句。亦不足以顯示其憤慨與熱忱。退處私室。則高歌曼舞。恬然自安。是則晋代清談誤國之象也。將驕卒悍。各據疆土。横徵苛歛。以快私慾。對内則恩怨分明。對外則絶對退讓。而猶日發請纓之電。日唱出兵之關。以此掩蔽人民之耳目。是又唐末藩鎭割據之局也。政客官僚。覥無廉恥。紀綱不立。法令不行。賣官鬻爵。聚歛搜括。驕奢淫佚。惟個人之利禄是謀。正直有爲之士。則極力排擠。好宄之輩。則朋比爲惡。是又明末崇禎時小人道長君子道消之象也。此外如國民經濟。日趨破落。人民生活。困窮不堪。災荒洊至。匪盜如麻。歷史上所有之動亂現象。今日又無不畢具。以如此破亂之局。又適當資本主義經濟恐慌拚死掙扎之時。我國前途。寗其堪問。</p>
<p>然則吾人其坐待國家之淪亡民族之覆滅乎。我民族遂眞無可挽救乎。此爲横梗於我人當前之急迫問題。時危勢急。國人都應作一次最後之打算。</p>

<h3>美國放棄金本位</h3>
<p>宣布恢復禁金出口令</p>
<p>國内物價已隨之上騰</p>
<p>羅斯福决定停止維持金圓價值</p>
<p>將咨請國會賦以膨脹通貨特權</p>
<p>目的在未來經濟談話中恃爲有力武器</p>
<p>國民十九日華盛頓電　「美國現在放棄金本位」、按此種率直聲明、乃今日美財長伍定於結束世界最猛烈之貨幣戰爭時所發表、此項戰爭歷時已久、在今日某一時期曾使美金元價值較諸他國貨幣貶至九角二分者也、</p>
<p>路透十九日華盛頓電　羅斯福總綂今日聲稱、現金出口禁令之恢復、乃提高國内物價之一種辦法、財政部長伍定答人問話、謂美國確暫時停止金本位、現不發黄金出口之熱照、一面頒布前已指定現金可許出口之條例云、伍定對此條例、不願續有聲明、惟謂此項條例頒布時、可使人了解何者可出口、何者不可出口云、據若干方面之推想、凡了結本星期以前所立商業契約之現金、仍可發給執照、准其出口、</p>
<p>路透十九日華盛頓電　參議員湯麥士與政府顧問現已草擬列入農村救濟案之修正文、欲以更大權力授予羅斯福總綂、以膨脹通貨、聞總綂對此修正文已予以同意、此案大約今日可提交國會、除授權總綂酌量發行通貨外、並規定許債務國於某種條件下用銀償付戰債、又規定以國際協定或其他辦法減少美幣之金成分、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十日華盛頓電　羅斯福總綂决定禁止現金出口、即放棄金本位一事、其原因由於國會急盼物價提高、意欲通過無拘束之通貨膨脹政策、雖目前不合時宜、亦所不顧、在此種情勢之下、羅斯羅與英相麥唐納及法國代表赫禮歐商議經濟及貨幣問題時、其大部份效力必因之喪失、蓋三國談話所可獲得之結論、將爲美國衆議院或參議院所推翻故也、羅斯福以爲欲使三國談話獲得結果、最佳方法、莫如聽任美金在國外市塲自然漲落、但當自作主張乃便加以控制耳、據云總綂此舉、若認爲對於匯兌低落國家一種威脅、俾使經濟談判易於進行、未免失之謬誤、總綂此舉、特欲避免無秩序之通貨膨脹而已、要之此種政策、目的在使幣價低落各國、能於經濟會議結束時、締結一種協定、以恢復金本位而已云云、</p>
<p>國民十九日華盛頓電　自美財長宣告美國正式放棄金本位後、上自金融界要人下至最貧苦之農民、莫不頓起膨脹通貨之狂熱、今夜美政府已得全國最大銀行之完全贊助、開始一種膨脹通貨計劃、並料在四十八小時内、國會將以其憲法權力讓與總綂、俾可膨脹美金元重用白銀爲貨幣、貶落金元價值、而與外國談判穩定全世界匯價、及接受債務國不逾一萬萬元之白銀、且聞此種重定金元價值與重用白銀爲貨幣、將爲美國出席世界經濟會議重要目的、</p>
<p>國民十九日華盛頓電　官塲意見皆謂當財部最初聲稱不再以黄金運出國外維持金元價值聽其自然漲落時、美國即已放棄金本位、至美政府之决定停止維持金元價值、乃因總綂羅斯福欲努力提高物價之故、雖總綂對於重申金禁、尚未發正式聲明、而白宮中人已徵實此說、謂總綂欲以不再維持金元價值之消極方法、提高物價、故特頒行政命令、禁止再運黄金出國、僅業已標識爲外國所有之金貨及貿易結算上所欠之差額、得照前頒條例運出國外而已、此舉結果立使國内市場各種物價莫不狂漲、即股票價格亦有同樣之暴漲、五金交易内銀價漲風最猛、竟達交易所條例所許之最大限度、漲至三百磅音、橡皮絲及五榖亦有同樣猛漲、獨糖價未受大影響、未能如其他物品之狂漲、而售出數量亦大减、業此者表示刻正摸索道路、一時遽難斷定也、此時金融家與經濟專家意見則甚爲混亂、紐約曾有一派要求伍定立即宣示財部今後方針、是否將切實放棄金圓價值之維持、抑僅暫時放棄、但白宮之唯一答復、僅宣告在續行通告以前、禁止黄金出口而已、此種情形遂令官場咸承認美國已放棄金本位、現外間對於此舉、謠言蠭起、紐約方面盛傳總綂欲禁止所有黄金出口、即行政命令所列爲例外者亦將在禁止之列、俾爲膨脹通貨之準備、但詢諸官廳尚未能證實此說、國會内對於金元在國外市場之地位、頗覺煩惱、曾有議員數人指稱、恐其價值未必能穩定、加以維持徒勞無功、而一般主張膨脹通貨派亦急急會議、外傳若輩曾有一函致總綂、聲明白宮苟不立即準備一切實計劃、則國會將通過其自擬之膨脹方案、但目下尚未能證實、僅有昨日曾進見總綂之參議員湯麥士聲稱、渠盼望在二十四小時將有一重要聲明發表、迨後人心震激稍減、即有經濟專家與接近總綂者聲稱、渠等逆料總綂將請國會對與貨幣問題再授以便宜行事權力、以便控制時局、國會議員數人亦謂此舉雖無異令國會放棄其憲法所賦鑄幣與規定幣價之權利、但議員中多有贊成在緊急時放棄此種權利、俾可授總綂與各國談論經濟事件時一有力之武器、民主黨某領袖則謂國會縱授此種權力於總綂、逆料總綂亦未必使用、僅藉以擠護美國在未來談話中所抱之政策而已、蓋此實爲其主要結果、若夫開啓立即大事膨脹通貨之途徑、尚非眞正之目的也、</p>
<h3>政府草擬膨脹通貨議案</h3>
<p>國民十九日華盛頓電　美財長伍定與國務卿赫爾及其他要人所草擬之膨脹通貨議案、將包括下列四點、一藉重用白銀爲貨幣及其他最良方法、由總綂自行發動、重定金元之價值、二與外國商訂協定、重定黄金價值、安定貨幣、遇總綂認爲必要時、得印刷綠背（鈔票名）或他種形式之貨幣、四以每盎斯不逾五角之銀價接受債務國不超過一萬萬元之白銀、當美政府方忙於草擬此新議案時、摩根銀公司主人亦在紐約發一聲明、贊同總綂之措施、聲稱現已顯然可見所有維持美金元匯兌價格之努力、使較他國貶值貨幣常居溢價地位一舉、業已發生一緊縮通貨影響、致美國物價與工資隨之大受緊縮、而失業亦日增、所以余覺脫離經濟衰落之顯明途徑、祇戰勝此緊縮通貨之勢力、而認政府現今之措施、乃在目前環境下最良途徑云云、</p>
<p>總綂友人皆謂羅氏或將不致被迫使用此案所賦之全部權力、尤其關於印刷綠背鈔票或無確定金銀爲準備之貨幣、其目的僅欲獲得較廣之權力、俾可與英法等國締結有利之協定、在要求他國提高其貨幣匯價時、即可將貶抑美國貨幣、使處於競爭地位之可能性、作爲談判之後盾、而大多數白宮顧問人員並謂此舉將可援予總綂强有力談判武器之說、亦非中肯之語、因在事實上此種新權力將可使美國應付他國所提許多提議也、」至國會方面對此案態度、則據各領袖聯合表示諒當可以通過、</p>
<h3>棄金本位含有四種作用</h3>
<p>路透二十日紐約電　紐約講壇報謂羅斯福總綂正式放棄金本位之舉動、含有</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>四種作用、一提高適合世界狀况之國内物價、二便利國内放欵之擴大、而無以人力維持國外美幣價格之必要、三改善美國在世界經濟會華府預會時對他國辦理貨幣問題之地位、四阻遏國會中偏向無制的膨脹計畫之趨勢、說者詳論美總綂政策、固有出入、但大都與講壇報所言者相合、衆料美總綂政策之意旨、或可於農村救濟案附件中見之、現聞羅總綂所同意之計畫、將以全權授與總綂處理國家貨幣、或謂美幣現有之金成分爲二十三格林二二、今後將减爲十六格林、參議員湯麥士所擬之修正案、今日可提交參院者、聞規定總綂有酌定通貨膨脹之權、故如屬適宜、則總綂當然有權以减輕金成分、再就現象觀之、世界經濟會議或將討論修改現行貨幣金比率四成標準之可能性、美當道顯然不願依允國會所擬廣鑄銀幣之要求、或類似從前白乃安氏所擬者之計畫、據消息最可恃者之意見、政府對於白銀固將有一種辦法、但同時亦將切實限制以銀爲通幣基礎之用途、</p>
<h3>投機狂熱市場驟形活動</h3>
<p>路透十九日紐約電　今日證劵交易所開盤、價格高一磅音至十一磅音、收盤時、許多證劵高一磅音至八磅音不等、華盛頓有膨脹計畫刻在計議中之消息傳來、投機者已以熱切狂潮應之、證劵買風之活、爲去年九月以來所未有、實業股票亦復升騰、交易甚旺、持重者謂英國停付現金時、英幣價先暴漲而後大跌、前車可鑒、宜稍愼重、但此說不足以抑投機家之勇氣也、金禁令之恢復、使美幣奥援無望、外幣匯價乃躍起、政府公債因膨脹之發展而趨於疲弱、其他證劵則形活潑、外國公債尤爲堅穩、重要銀行家今日對於政府辦理膨脹問題之决定、表示甚大希望、全國民衆預料政府將採行有毅力之行動、以制止令人心痛似無盡期之緊縮過程、物品市塲得政府將採行膨脹程序之消息後、驟形活動、雜糧買風狂作、爲平時所罕覩、芝加哥麥市每斛初漲起美金五分、迨近收盤時、了結者多、致已漲之價跌去不少、但較昨日猶高一分七五至二分半不等、棉市每包約漲兩元、銀條市價亦漲至一九三一年十一月以後之最高度、同時橡皮牛皮糖絲皆達近年未有之高價、投機買氣瀰漫各市塲、故成交數大都爲新紀錄、今日現銀因投機家暢買、價漲三分半、此乃多年未有之最大漲風、期銀亦狂漲、達美金三分之極度、亦五金業交易所成立以來所不常有之奇觀也、期銀後因了結而回落、但不久復漲起、各月份期貨皆視前日約高三分、銀市之有此漲風、蓋以銀在切實膨脹計畫中將佔重要部份也、</p>
<h3>維克案判决後英禁俄貨進口施報復</h3>
<p>紐絲綸將繼起踵行</p>
<p>俄貨輸出大受打擊</p>
<p>路透十九日倫敦電　據倫敦可恃消息、如英人桑頓與麥克唐諾二人得免監禁處分、則英國對於俄貨進口之禁令即可撤除、禁令現已簽字、定四月二十六日實施、運英貨受影響者佔百分之八○、如奶油雜糧原棉火油木料等是、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十九日倫敦電　蘇俄法庭判决英國技師處罪之後、英政府以禁止蘇俄貨物輸入爲報復、若干人士認爲並無理由、謂英國保守黨人士始終反對與俄國締交禁止俄貨輸入一舉、定係欲使保守黨滿意、否則英技師所處並非重刑、何至採取如此激烈對付手段、</p>
<p>路透二十日莫斯科電　衆料蘇俄將大受英國禁止俄貨入口之影響、因蘇俄現僅賴對英貿易出超所得、以應付其他各國之債務云、</p>
<p>路透二十日威靈敦電　紐絲綸首相福柏士今日宣稱、政府即將考慮禁止俄貨入口事宜云、</p>
<p>路透十九日倫敦電　俄國輸至蘭開夏之原棉、近年大增、故禁止俄貨進口之令、亦將使英國棉紡織家經紀商及航商受其影響、蘭開夏某棉業公司職員今日聲稱、該公司購用俄棉、覺其甚爲美滿、宣稱和花、但若不用之亦無妨碍云、又孟却斯德某重要棉紡家稱、俄棉固屬不惡、但渠以爲禁令不致使蘭開夏大受影響、因美棉價格現頗低賤也、</p>
<p>路透十九日莫斯科電　現據此間英使署消息、英國新任駐俄大使二三月内未必能抵莫斯科、俄外交委員李維諾夫夫人定今夜開招待會、邀請各國外交代表及新聞記者與會、惟英使署人員皆不擬與會、</p>
<h3>全德熱烈慶祝希特勒誕辰</h3>
<p>募欵散給貧困</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十日柏林電　希特勒總理誕辰因在國難期間、不願舉行慶祝娱樂、但各衙署均懸掛國旗、晚間並舉行提燈會、以總理壽辰而有此景象、自鐵血宰相畢士麥而後、此爲第一次、全德報紙均特闢希特勒欄、僧城棕色宮、（國社黨部）接到慶祝函電及各種禮物至夥、今晨八時柏林内務部前、軍隊警察國社黨員及鋼盔團均參加檢閱、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十日柏林電　希特勒總理誕辰、國社黨以四月廿日全德人民不患飢餓爲理由、發起募捐、結果共得現欵九萬馬克、食物約值七萬馬克、</p>
<h3>戈林離羅馬前演說經濟問題</h3>
<p>出席國會代表會議</p>
<p>日代表猶侈言和平</p>
<p>國民十九日羅馬電　德國普魯士邦總理戈林、今日曾覲見意王後、復出席於各國國會代表經濟會議、向意議員致詞、此爲國際代表致詞之第一人、戈林稱、現在無一國家能單獨解决經濟問題、而德國實爲與目前世界經濟組織牽連最深之國家、故德國亦即爲最情願與各鄰邦合作以圖積極解决各項經濟問題之國家、今舉世之人對於世界之已達一歷史上轉機之點、均不應熟視無睹、今日有毁壞全世界之危險、而意大利實爲有奮鬥抵抗此種毁壞力之第一國云、今日各國代表在此集會、應以和衷共濟爲目的、不應再以戰勝國或戰敗國之態度相對、如是國際間之難題、始有澈底解决之望云、戈氏演說後、日本代表復起立致詞、其論調不外於日本亟願在遠東恢復和平、日本雖退出國聯、但對於維持和平與各强國協調合作、則始終不變其態度云、當會議將閉幕時、意王曾於臨行之前與戈林氏歡然握别、墨索里尼亦向戈林氏表示彼稱讚意大利處感謝之意尼、戈林氏今日下午乘飛機至米蘭參觀米蘭物品競賽會、　　哈瓦斯二十日柏林電　巴本於今晨自羅歡馬返抵此間、鋼盔團儀仗隊在車站迎、</p>
<h3>齋藤决心戀棧</h3>
<p>薩派與西園寺不相容</p>
<p>政友會國同密謀倒閣</p>
<p>華聯二十日東京電　齋藤首相曾在地方長官會議席上、對各地方長官談云非常時未去、各官長仍須努力、今日又對某大官表示、高橋財長如果堅决求去、内閣亦不願總辭職、齋藤心境變化原因、係由於軍部與關東軍極力以對政變、上院各派與元老重臣亦恐法西斯蒂乘機奪取政權、發生内亂所致、因上列原因、故齋藤决定戀棧、然而近日來政友會與國民同盟密謀倒閣、形勢殊堪注目、</p>
<p>十四日東京萬朝報云、自宮内省西園寺八郎突然提出辭職、政局之推移、愈爲混沌、據熟悉政情者之觀測、此次西園寺八郎辭職之意、一言蔽之、即薩派對西園寺公之挑戰是也、憶齋藤内閣成立之際、西園寺公之對於天皇下問、山本權兵衛伯竟拒絶西園寺之招請、換言之、以山本伯爲總帥、擁護牧野·齋藤·宇垣·伊澤·湯淺等之薩派、爲謀鞏固勢力起見、與西園寺公流露反對痕跡、因此西園寺八郎表示引退、據目下情形而論、近在暗中劃策之伊澤湯淺等、尚不過爲薩派之前衛、而實際問題尤爲重大、當兹政局變動之時、薩派對園公之單獨奏聞、必有反對舉動、因元老派間之意見深刻化、政局前途、恐將發生意外波瀾、</p>
<p>又云、去年十月間、由某方面發現怪文書、該文書中暴露○○事件之關係、當時欲大活動之宇垣朝鮮總督、爲此文書影響、曾受致命的打擊、嗣後對宇垣仍極不滿、竟有不令宇垣渡朝鮮海峽之威嚇信、幸渠置若罔聞、收買言論機關以緩和之、該怪文書中、又曾提及牧野之事、故牧野嘗露辭意、惟薩派之意、如果牧野辭職、仍擬推薦齋藤總理繼任、而次期之内閣、則内定爲宇垣、目下薩派之伊澤、正四出活動、並在大阪調達資金、同時以薩派爲背景之民政黨、極力防衛次期内閣之移於政友會、如此猛烈的政權爭奪戰、悉爲元老派之意見衝突而掀動波浪也、</p>
<h3>日本移民東北計畫</h3>

<h3>四强協定計劃意法交換意見</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯十九日巴黎電　外國方面、對於四强條約計畫之談話、曾有種種消息傳播、此間外交界人士有所聲明、謂對於此項條約計畫、現正與意國政府進行談話、法國對於四强條約所提出之備忘錄、確曾以非正式方式遞交德國政府、正與前此英國關於四强條約提議之曾送交德國者無異云云、</p>
<h3>異國女同胞到前綫去</h3>
<p>勿任日女子專美於前</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社東京通訊　自中國北部戰事發生以來、大阪港附近某藥劑學校女學生、以爲女生輩不當僅在後方効力、遇必要時、亦當出發前線、在戰濠中服務、乃要求陸軍第四師團參謀部、派軍事敎員來校、從事訓練、女生輩此項要求、與其認爲愛國心理之自動表示、無寗謂爲陸軍當道、在女學生方面作有秩序宣傳之效果、日本各報各雜誌中、時有女學生由兵士指導作打靶及步伐練習之照片、在軍部方面、自不欲依賴婦女、保衛國家、其意大約欲使婦女對於軍國主義運動、感覺興趣、倡導此項之動者、不僅欲以軍國主義、用於戰塲之上、且欲藉以解决未來各項重要社會問題也、</p>

<p>吳市長昨發表談話</p>
<p>反對租界攫奪工廠檢查</p>
<p>但仍願與租界當局磋商</p>
<p>中央社云、關於前日公共租界納稅西人通過修改洋涇浜章程附則、以攫奪工廠檢查權一案、吳市長發表談話如次、</p>
<p>余嘗聲明、工廠檢查、關於我國整個的勞工行政及在特區内工廠法之執行權、應屬於中國政府機關、中國政府此種主張、就政治原則法律原則及工部局職權本身而言、絶無反對之理由、乃工部局師承其向來利用修改洋涇浜章程或增訂附則之辦法、以濫事擴充其權限、我人之稍明租界發展之歷史者、孰不引爲憾事、昨日、工部局總董貝爾君宣讀議案時、固嘗謂工部局之所以未能檢查工廠者、因爲歷史上之理由、余深信貝爾君苟稍顧及租界發展之全部歷史、其見解必當變更、當一八六二年七月、上海道台欲向租界内華人徵稅、英領反對、但英使布魯士訓令英領曰、「查條約并無容許吾人干涉此項之規定、道台當有權徵收華人捐稅、該稅在界外之城内外居民、均已照繳、吾人殊無反對之理由」、又謂「吾人如不許中國政府管轄界内之華人、則吾人不能得依條約十八條、該國政府與吾人之保護」、英使之意見、爲英國政府所贊同、故翌年、英外相羅素爾通知英使云、「英租界之土地屬於中國無疑、不能以華人住於租界内之故、而免除其對該國之義務」、其時上海一部份外人、猶復昧然、故英使復訓令該國領事曰、中國政府、從未正式放棄其對於華人之管理權、英國政府、亦未曾要求或明白表示若何願望、以取得保護華人之權、此二事幸勿忘之也、在原則上、不能立足之制度、英政府不願維持」、英國公使之態度、爲各國所贊同、美公使巴靈庚訓令美領西華德曰、「外人辦理市政、時常侵犯華人之權利、因此必須喚醒外人歸於原則上之安全地帶我不能同意於任何不顧中國權利、即不顧一個主權國家對於其土地與人民應有之權利的辦法」、總上各節、租界之法律地位、固甚明顯、即就歷史而言、工部局職權之限制、亦不言而喻、數典固未可忘祖也、工部局明知、雖按照前人所處心積慮慘澹經營之洋涇浜土地章程、工部局亦無權辦理工廠管理事項、又明知欲因此事而修改章程、必不能得中國政府之同意、遂思以取巧之方法、根據該章程第十一條、召集納稅西人會特别會議、以修改附則、希冀議案通過後、得有過半數有約各國領事官及公使之批准、即爲有效、而不須商得中國政府同意、顯然佯爲不知、該章程同條有規定增改停止不得與章程抵觸之載明、按照所謂租界根本法之洋涇浜章程、其職權祗限於一爲設立辦事公局、二爲興造租界以内各項應辦工程及常年修理之事、三爲租界全境應行妥當整治潔淨、設立路燈、儲水灑地、以免塵污、開通溝渠、四爲設立巡查街道巡警、（此項亦最後增加、始初祗能設立更夫）、五爲籌備公局所需公用基地房屋或租或買事宜、六爲籌措公局應行延請雇用之辦公上下人役、故工部局章程第九條、内「租界地方必當預籌治理、以資妥善、」一節、所許治理之事、係列舉而非概括者、按法律解釋之定例、列舉方法與概括方法之異處、在於前者以列舉者爲限、後者則可類推、增設附則、祗能爲達到「以便章程各項更增完善」之目的、但不能出此章程所列各項範圍之外、否則與章程第十一條所謂「不能與章程相背」一節抵觸、即屬無效、故昨日西人納稅會通過關於檢查工廠之議案、依照洋涇浜章程、亦不能取得法律上之根據也、余對於工部局採取此種態度、深以爲憾、然中國政府整個勞工行政之權、斷不肯放棄、又何况租界當局、擬攫取我國勞工行政權之辦法、於法律又并無根據、其地位與通過附則、與前未嘗稍異乎、惟工廠管理爲當務之急、不能稍緩、余仍願竭誠與租界當局磋商解决辦法、使中國主權、不爲僭越、同時使全市勞工、蒙其福利、勞資關係、日臻融洽也、</p>

<p>國聞社云、昨日、美國廢止金本位、同時一方恢復金禁令、以防金子有極度湧出、致本埠金業咸生極大變化、金業交易所、於昨日上午起、跌勢一落千丈、前破千元關口之標金、竟跌落至千元關内、市場混亂、上下午之差度、達六十餘兩、記者於此特趨詢金融界方面某銀行鉅子、據談詳情如次、</p>
<p>美廢金本位</p>
<p>據談、略謂、美素用金本位、今日突然廢止、將來變化、固無從揣測、惟其廢去原因、當然不外生産多而準備不足、其他在輔幣方面、亦有關係、蓋美之用金元、譬如我之用銀元、苟一律准用銀元、而無銅元毫洋之輔助、於週轉方面究屬不便、美廢金本位、其中情形、固不若是簡單、總之、與中國可謂無弊害、且稍有利、</p>
<p>與中國有利</p>
<p>至於有利之說、因美廢用金本位後、必用銀兩、如此則金價落而銀價必提高、中國素用銀、且每年進出俱爲入超、今用同樣銀子、能多購一些貨物、豈非利乎、出口商固須明虧、但近年查海關册、幾無月不爲入超也、　　同時行金禁</p>
<p>至美廢棄金本位、同時恢復禁金、此亦係事理所應爲、蓋唯恐金改銀位、一時若無用、如流出太多、亦非有利於美、故必須出口、如中國近以銀元計、但在現時亦仍在金禁中、　　增加購買力</p>
<p>此次美廢棄金本位之原意、余之觀察、實係國内生産擁擠、一切貨物、供過於求、人民方面、限於生活程度之高、尤以實行金本位、一則人民無力擔負、二則金融趨於呆滯、商民因貨物不能暢銷、盡押諸銀行、銀行以現欵成死貨、金融不暢通、種種關係、故特行此舉、行後、不但金融流通、人民能減少支出、對購物力亦稍可增加、</p>
<p>上海占一位</p>
<p>查世界經濟市場、首推英之倫敦、次即美之紐約、惟美屢思吸收英倫市塲、鑑於英政策與商貨集中方法之佳妙、美國終成泡影、但上海一埠、曾占第三位世界經濟市場、因滬地貨物能銷之故、過去無論何國之貨、何種之貨、迨到滬後、苟能稍廉價目、必有受主、故外人稱滬爲傾銷市場、今美棄金本位、與上海市場、可謂毫無影響也、</p>

<h3>空軍防禦空軍</h3>
<p>飛機勝於高射砲</p>
<p>航協會决先訂購</p>
<p>林我將氏之談話</p>
<p>航空徵求成績、第四次報告時、徵求總隊長吳鐵城市長、曾有訂購飛機十二架、編成一隊、北上抗敵之主張、而社會一般人之意見、頗有防禦敵機、不如多置高射砲、因中日空軍機數、相差過遠、增加一二隊、恐裨益軍事者甚少也、新聲社記者、昨晨訪航空協會秘書長林我將氏、詢以訂購飛機之進行狀况、防空究屬有利、據林氏答稱、本會預定先購飛機十八架、編成二隊、俟上海徵求結果後、支欵訂購、係因華北局勢日危、故有提先訂購之議、各理事均表同意、俟下星期常會通過後即訂購、至向何國何廠訂購、尚未具體决定、防空利器、據外國航空與軍事專家之意見、均認爲飛機之效力、優於高射砲、因高射砲位置固定、必敵機飛入其射程所及之範圍内、始能奏效、而飛機之飛行速度甚大、稍縱即逝、命中之機會甚少、故最有效之方法、仍不外以空軍防禦空軍也、</p>

<h3>申報年鑑編者序</h3>
<p>張·梓·生·</p>
<p>「一物不知，儒者之恥」這是一句古訓。</p>
<p>「秀才不出門，能知天下事。」在前代，智識是士大夫階級的專有品，只有秀才，纔能知「天下事」。可是，到了我們這個時代，就不同了。智識成爲大衆的生活必需品。現代一個良好的公民，都必須瞭解政治，法律，經濟，社會，軍事的常識，都必須明瞭本國和世界大勢。不論是一個農民，商人，工人，學生，生産者或消費者，要是對於現代的一切活動，没有相當的認識，連個人生活，都會感到許多困難，更不必說爲國家爲社會服務了。</p>
<p>現代人類活動的方面，是非常寛泛，而又是互相牽連的。現代人類的生産，已從自給自足的農村生産，變而爲社會生産，國家生産，京國立音樂院敎授、歷有年所、藝術深邃、在現代音樂界中、佔有要席、四載前與世界著名小提琴家漢遜女士、環遊世界、開演奏會多次、頗受社會歡迎、道經滬江時、音專校長蕭友梅震其名、竭誠羅致、聘爲鋼琴組主任、桃李盈門、頗多雋才、學生中如李獻敏·救復生等、將於今夏畢業、聞該校同人除公讌慶祝外、並饋贈物品、以資紀念、</p>

<p>十數同人的研討、執筆從事者、連主編，編纂及特約撰述，達三十一人，並得社會各界人士的合作，乃得與國人相見。我們覺得更值得紀念的：申報年鑑第一次的發刊，適當國難深重之日。國家與民族正在忍辱負重，整甲礪兵以期抗禦外侮。自然，中國民族，只有奮勇鬥爭，抗日反帝這條出路。但是以近代國家組織的複雜，政治，經濟，文化都和國防密切相關。而本國内情與國際局勢，更互相牽連而不可分離。要不是國民全體對於内外情勢有深切的認識，單憑血氣之勇，斷不能抗禦外侮，消除國難。中山先生曾有知難行易的遺訓。愚昧是民族的最大弱點。申報年鑑的發行，要是在增加國民認識這一點上，對於抗日反帝的工作，有些微的效勞，這是同人們最大的期望了！</p>
<p>末了，應該感謝各方的掖助，並希望熱心愛護諸君，指示我們的缺點！一九三三，三，二四。</p>

<h3>私塾改良</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>私塾改良的名詞，又時時發現於敎育新聞了；見了這名詞，不由的憧憬着二十九年前的私塾改良工作。</p>
<p>其時，我校丨丨蘇省高等學堂同人曾在蘇城組織一私塾改良會的夜校，招集一般私塾敎師授以簡易師範法，我擔任的是文法講員，講至名代動靜狀等用法，頗引起着許多年齡倍於我的私塾敎師的興趣，只爲他們聞所未聞的緣故。</p>
<p>後來，學校漸漸發達，私塾改良的呼聲，也漸漸的寂寞了；至今將近三十年，忽又高呼着私塾改良的口號，這便引起我的惶惑，二十九年前的私塾要改良，二十九年後的私塾依舊要改良，試問改到何時才良呢？私塾的設備是很簡單的，尚且改了將近三十年而不良，其他，則又何說？</p>
<p>最近，廣東三水縣私塾，縣令一律釘封解散，其有陽奉陰違的，縣政府令行公安局云：「似此墨瀋未乾，竟敢故違功令，實屬玩法已極，合再令仰該局長卽便遵照，立將該塾師尅日驅逐出境，如再仍前冥頑，准卽拿解來府，以憑懲辦。」這位雷厲風行的三水縣縣長，竟把敎師當做敎匪看待了。他確認私塾都是不良，而從事於根本剷除，這固然是一種很爽快的辦法；但，只怕該塾師回問一句：「私塾不良，學校果然都良了麽？」我以爲折衷的辦法，改良私塾和改良學校，有同時並進的必要。</p>
<h3>夢話</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>伸長了脖子，恭候着皇軍高抬貴手，賜喫倭刀的準亡國奴，要得快樂，最好的方法，還是枕着三尺三寸的高枕頭，去追求邯鄲一夢。</p>
<p>一腔子義憤，滿想登臺去發表一番，或是用筆頭來宣佈一下，但是捨不得犧牲掉數十年共存共榮的喫飯傢伙，畏首畏味，終於把頭一縮就算了。在夢中，可直言莫怪。</p>
<p>滿肚子治國平天下的文章經濟，釣盡了秦淮，玄武的大小魚兒，無奈今文王正眼都不誚一誚。在夢中，可打倒你，我來。</p>
<p>胃口不濟的，不指望這些，但是，眼看着張小哥那麽藏了銀的窖了金的，摟着美人兒跳舞，夥着洋大人打哥而夫，怎不眼紅。在夢中，希甚麽罕，可比他再樂些兒。</p>
<p>尋飯吃，嘔盡了烏氣。看老闆，阿大的臉還不夠，頭櫃，二櫃，也會裝出像煞有介事的架子來。氣儘嘔，打落門牙儘望肚裏嚥。在夢中，打倒的打倒，驅逐的驅逐，出一口氣。</p>
<p>淌了十二小時的汗，所得的報酬，還裝不滿一家八口的肚子，初三十八大葷小葷期，買了三百大錢頸項肉，至少已負了二百大錢印子債。在夢中，可過屠門而大嚼，不用會鈔。</p>
<p>一年四季，藥罐不離身，骨瘦如柴，藥的功效，等於白開水，儘找急，儘没有離床之望。在夢中，可回復健康，上杭州，遊龍華，隨心所欲。</p>
<p>至人無夢，痴人說夢。但是俺家大成至聖先師，尚且還要夢見周公。可知做夢也並不是不登大雅之堂的一回事。</p>
<p>這年頭兒，十個倒有九個是到處碰壁的。做和尚，跳黄浦，不會夢中作樂，都是痴人，醉生夢死，視人生如一夢，纔是至人。</p>
<h3>偶見佛敎會鑄贈日本震災紀念堂梵鐘拓本得句時日本北海道震災復作而熱河正在酣戰也</h3>
<p>— 葭夢廬</p>
<p>鐘聲鳴後砲聲來，大陸陰霾鬱不開，不共戴天兼履地，有誰念此肺肝摧。</p>
<p>揾盡紅巾弔國殤，倒懸未解此民殃，蒲牢隔海聲聲吼，可有聲聞到戰場。</p>
<p>善戰由來服上刑，那能懺悔到幽冥，人心已死天心厭，怪底巖墻激怒霆。</p>
<p>上帝無言百鬼獰，（借句）萬千恩怨在羣生，血花飛盡天花　，一杵清鐘照月明。</p>

<p>楊桂枝爲了那衣服差當一塊錢，正想和當店裏伙計，放下臉來爭吵的時候，身後有人喊了起來。回頭一看，却是趙自强跑着追來了。桂枝紅了臉道：趙連長也到這裏來了。趙自强笑道：我聽見我那聽差說，老姑娘把棉衣服夾着出大門去了。我就去問你老太太，這是爲着什麽？你老太太說，還差了三兩塊錢過年。拿着當錢去了。我想，這樣一點小事，何必閙到數久寒天來當棉衣服，年邊下我們發了一關餉，由我來代墊一下子就得了。回去罷。他說着話，就把櫃台上那一捲衣服扯了下來，在脇下夾着，在前面引路，老姑娘到了此時，不能不跟着他走，而且恨那當舖裏伙計，太不通人情，回過頭來，狠狠的向櫃上的伙計瞪了一眼，然後跟着趙自强走上街來。這趙連長爲人，和甘二爺爲人不同，他却十分的拘謹，始終在桂枝的前面走着，頭也不回，不用說談話了。二人急急忙忙的走着，一會兒到了家裏。江氏早到大門口來，兩手接過衣服去向趙連長連連拱揖道，多謝多謝，怎樣好要你帮我們這樣一個大忙呢？過了年，我手裏活動了，一定照數相還。他說畢，又向桂枝道：你不知道，趙連長心眼兒眞好，聽說咱們家等債户逼的不得了，借了五塊錢給他們過年，他們這除了還債，連過年的錢都有了。你說，平白的要趙連長帮這樣一個大忙，心裏怎樣過得去呢？趙自强笑着搖了兩搖手道：别說了，别說了，說了怪寒憎的。他也不等江氏再說下文，人已經走遠了。桂枝走到屋子裏來皺了眉埋怨着母親道：你這是胡來了，無原無故的，怎好收下人家一筆錢呢丨江氏道：我也這樣說。可是他特意來問我，我不能不說實話。（四八）</p>
<h3>窮春偶記</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>入春以來，氣侯還是很凉冷，雖然梅花已開過，而且也殘了；但桃花倒底比往年葩得遲了。</p>
<p>一向又吹着東北風，早起枕上，有晨曦煖烘烘地炙着，心裏微笑了，這晴雲淡日的春朝，不想去南屏聽古寺的鐘聲嗎？</p>
<p>然而遠林裏又傳來了鶉鴣的殷勤的嗁聲。我們鄉間有着一支俚曲說：「鵓鴣哥，風多雨多。」我的眉又鎖起來了。　　好像這飛禽的嗚聲，畢竟可以主占風雨，往往農人挾傘在太陽光裏上市集去，回村的時候已下雨了。</p>
<p>晴的早晨，像五月天氣，可以穿單衫，但一陣大風，黑雲膨脹，墨水那樣散開，冷雨便奔騰的瀉下，小溝能游毛頭鴨，帆影會浮上二樓來，那時候，不穿厚的駱駝絨袍，你不久的太陽穴，準要發燒。鄉間有句箴言說：出門要防三九月。那是指廢曆而言的：然而相傳下來很靈騐。</p>
<p>前年今日，從超山看了大明堂的梅花，（現被賊斫瓌）回塘棲舟中，天還晴朗熱暖得很，而下午，和石瓢和尚跑到虎跑寺去，風雲突然變色，雨挾着雪，紛紛下墮，繼着竟擲冰雹了，我戴着呢帽還不要緊，石瓢的秃頂却給卵大的雹打中，擦破皮，碎了，濺出胭脂紅的血，才後向小樹下暫時躱避了半晌。直到雹停再走，衣衫是全濕透了。石瓢的頂上，至今賸有傷痕，所以又名「病瓢」，現在正在杭州凈慈寺讀經。我回上海，因此也患了一塲疾瘧。</p>
<p>爲了這敎訓，在奇怪的今年，怕寒暖不時的氣候戲弄，旅行又帶不多重量的東西：故至今還早夜流浪在吃人靈魂的上海城中。</p>
<h3>參觀香港先施國貨展覽會後</h3>
<p>— 文璞</p>
<p>不佞自南洋來，道經香港，，聞先施公司正值舉行國貨展覽會，曾一度往觀。因見此種展覽會關係民生極大，尤爲我國當前之急務，故作斯記，以供各埠大商塲倣行，藉作借鏡。</p>
<p>會塲設於該公司天台，佈置精美，秩序井然，絲織棉毛等品，一一分門别類，依次陳列。參加廠商，港粵滬三埠俱有，達數十家，來賓之來參觀者，殊爲踴躍，名人如蔡廷鍇譚啓秀劉紀文張炎鄒敏初君等，皆先後蒞止，各團體機關等均結隊而來，頗足表演民衆愛用國貨之心理，誠國難聲中一差强人意之舉也。不佞客居南洋數十載，該地僑民，衣食住三者，皆仰給於外人，雖有愛用國貨之心理，實無精美之國貨可購，每年所費於外貨之金錢，不下千萬。現今國貨出品，已有若是之進步，若是之優良，苟能使僑民有所認識，未有不樂爲採用爭相購買者。深望先施當局，將提倡國貨之國貨展覽會；漸次推廣，喚起民衆一致服用國貨，使民衆普遍認識國貨之優點，國計民生，實利賴之焉。</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>春筍</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>梁上燕語呢喃；竹中嫰芽出土，這眞是陽春中和時節；也是燕筍上市的當兒。</p>
<p>江浙多植竹，不論山間平地，千竿璧玉，萬葉翠釵，觸目皆是。不過山竹所生的笋，碩大多毛，俗呌做毛筍，宜於烤食或製乾。在鄉間竹園中所掘取的，那看時令而各異其名。二三月中呌燕筍，因爲這時梁燕纔從南方歸來。再遲的呌做　鷄笋，因爲這時眞是鷄鶵出殼的時候。最遲一種呌晚茁笋，要在五月中才有。</p>
<p>約良朋三五；沽村醪一甕，呼鄉兒往竹園中掘取鮮笋，卽令家人烹煮。竹味嫰而甜；竹湯鮮而潔，如此風味，在上海恐難辦到。</p>
<p>雷一鳴，笋卽奇長；倘在天氣晴寒的時候，它却生得很遲緩的。他不但人人歡喜咬嚼，便是野驩山猹等，每在風高月黑的時候，偷偷地跑到竹園子裏，把他生吞活剝的吃下肚去。</p>
<p>甬東的竹，便是上邊所說的毛筍。每歲出筍王一枝，鉅大異常。旁有二筍稍低，呌做筍將。筍尖的籜梢，生有錦帶長尺餘，如古人帽上所插的雉雞毛一般。人都不敢去掘食他，倘使誤剷了牠，那家便有奇禍。這是古書上記載的，到底有不有這一回事，倒要問問這地方的人咧。</p>
<h3>子椰</h3>
<p>— 張一菴</p>
<p>近來聽說椰殼灰（炭？）可作軍事上防禦毒瓦斯用，因此我想起了椰子的一切。</p>
<p>椰子原是南洋羣島的産物，而每年輸入廣東的却不在少數，所以椰子在廣東便成爲一種很通行的食品，而廣東人則没有一個不認識椰子的。</p>
<p>如果你到了廣東，最容易找得到椰子的所在便是「鹹酸甜」的擔子上。在每一個「鹹酸甜」的擔子或攤子上都少不了椰子，切成三角塊或長條兒，白得像羊脂玉，浸在清水裏的；而且，凡是鹹酸甜擔子賣椰子的一定同酸薑片一起。吃的人也喜歡兩樣一起吃。</p>
<p>所謂「鹹酸甜」擔者，可以顧名思義而得之，擔子上賣的是醃酸的，鹹的，甜的果菜之類，例如酸黄瓜，醋浸的芥菜頭，酸辣菜，酸蘿　，酸辣椒，甜木瓜片，鹹沙梨等類；　的則有海蜇，鰌魚。擔子上有小爐小鍋，備以燙熟海蜇鰌魚的。這種擔子，在上海虹口一帶也可以看得見。</p>
<p>在我幼年時候，酸薑和椰子都賣兩個小錢一片，現在椰子要賣到兩三個銅板了。</p>
<p>椰子在新年的全盒（糖果盤）裏也有地位，是用糖煮過而晒乾了的，一種切作扁條兒，呌作糖椰絲，一種切作三角塊兒，呌作糖椰角；因爲它的渣多汁少，我一向不大歡喜吃。</p>
<p>還有在定親的禮物裏也有用整半個的椰子肉，像瓢兒一樣的，上面用金彩顏色描繪些龍鳳雙喜的花紋的。</p>
<p>現在西餅店裏有一種呌椰撻的（撻是Tast的譯音）上面是所得很細的椰子絲和着糖汁。</p>
<p>做咖喱鷄常要加入椰子磨出的汁才好吃。外行人做咖喱鷄不懂得這一點就永遠不會把咖喱鷄弄得好吃。</p>
<p>家裏買了整個椰子回來之後，先將椰衣剝除了，然後用一枚釘子之類在椰殼上打一個洞，讓椰汁丨像牛乳一樣的白汁流出來。這汁除了當水喝之外没有什麽用，味道略甜。然後用鋸子將椰殼分兩半解開。椰肉經挖出來供食之後，那兩半邊椰殼便充作水瓢用。廣東的軍隊身邊多繫着這麽一個椰瓢。有時椰瓢碎了，這些碎片便成爲我們做手工的材料了。</p>

<h3>「以夷制夷」</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>我還記得，當去年中國有許多人，一味哭訴國聯的時候，日本的報紙上往往加以譏笑，說這是中國祖傳的「以夷制夷」的老手段。粗粗一看，也彷彿有些像的，但是，其實不然。那時的中國的許多人，的確將國聯看作「青天大老爺」，心裏何嘗還有一點兒「夷」字的影子。</p>
<p>倒相反，「青天大老爺」們郤常常用着「以華制華」的方法的。</p>
<p>例如罷，他們所深惡的反帝國主義的「犯人」，他們自已倒是不做惡人的，只是鬆鬆爽爽的送給華人，呌你自已去殺去。他們所痛恨的腹地的「共匪」，他們自已是並不明白表示意見的，只將飛機炸彈賣給華人，呌你自已去炸去。對付下等華人的有黄帝子孫的巡捕和西崽，對付智識階級的有「高等華人」的學者和博士。</p>
<p>我們自誇了許多日子的「大刀隊」，好像是無法制伏的了，然而四月十五日的「ＸＸ報」上，有一個用頭號字印「我斬敵二百」的題目。粗粗一看，是要令人覺得勝利的，但我們再來看一看本文罷丨丨</p>
<p>一（本報今日北平電）昨夜喜峯口右翼，仍在灤陽城以東各地，演爭奪戰。敵出現大刀隊　　千名，係新開到者，與我大好隊對抗。其刀特長，敵使用不靈活。我軍揮刀砍抹，敵招　　架不及，連刀帶臂，被我砍落者縱横滿地，我軍傷亡亦達二百餘。」：：：</p>
<p>那麽，這其實是「敵斬我軍二百」了，中國的文字，眞是像「國步」一樣，正在一天一天的艱難起來。但我要指出來的却並不在此。</p>
<p>我要指出來的是「大刀隊」乃中國人自誇已久的特長，日本人雖有擊劍，大刀却非素習。現在可是「出現」了，這不必遲疑，就可决定是滿洲的軍隊。滿洲從明末以來，每年即大有直隸山東人遷居，數代之後，成爲土著，則雖是滿洲軍隊，而大多數實爲華人，也决無疑義。現在已經各用了特長的大刀，在灤東相殺起來，一面是「連刀帶臂，縱横滿地」，一面是「傷亡亦達二百餘」，開演了極顯著的「以華制華」的一幕了。</p>
<p>至於中國的所謂手段，由我看來，有是也應該說有的，但决非「以夷制夷」，倒是想「以夷制華」。然而「夷」又那有這麽蠢笨呢，却先來一套「以華制華」給你看。</p>
<p>這例子常見於中國的歷史上，後來的史官爲新朝作頌，稱此輩的行爲曰：「爲王前驅」！　　近來的戰報是極可詫異的，如同日同報記冷口的失守云：「十日以後，冷口方面之戰，　　非常激烈，華軍：：：頑强抵抗，故繼續未曾有之大激戰，」但由宮崎部隊以十餘兵士，　　作成人梯，前仆後繼，「卒越過長城，因此宮崎部隊犧牲二十三名之多云。」越過一個險　　要，而日軍只死了二十三人，但已云「之多」，又稱爲「未曾有之大激戰」，也未免有些費　　解。所以大刀隊之戰，也許並不如我所猜測。但旣經寫出，就姑且留下以備一說罷。</p>
<h3>内外補遺</h3>
<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>何家幹先生在「内外」篇裏，闡發内外有别的道理及治心不同的方法，透澈極了，很可以當作宋儒的「語錄」讀。不過我覺得還有遺漏的地方，所以不揣簡陋，敢來補充一點意見。好在現今正適逢提倡陽明之學的盛世，德澤所被，吾儕小人似乎也理應有一些應時的點綴。</p>
<p>分别内外，如果依照宋儒的話看來，尚不過是初步的工夫。眞講得精微時，更有所謂内外合一之道，有内無外，綂外於内，因之這内即爲「無外之内」；同時，即在内心裏面，又有所謂「已發」和「未發」的分别。至於用意所在，無非是說：不要去管外面，但能顧着内面，便應用無窮了；而且，「已發」即着形跡，「未發」才是渾然一體，不可意想，不可告人。古人有云：「道心惟微，人心惟危」。即此之謂。</p>
<p>宋遭遼金之禍，據說「宋學」就是藥救當時的人心的。現在中國正處於與宋代同樣的情狀下，不過遼金換了日本；同樣的社會情狀産生同樣的意識情態，「無怪宋學」要復活了。外患的對象變了，不變的還是中國。</p>
<p>有人懷疑「宋學」的興起，終挽回不了宋室的危亡。其實「宋學」原是宋室瀕於危亡時的流産，屈於此者，必伸於彼，對外旣然碰璧，自只有反而求諸内心了。</p>
<p>到底遼金未能亡宋，亡宋者乃是元！</p>
<h3>雨天</h3>
<p>— 沙駝</p>
<p>醒來，看見水珠兒在窗口滴，雨在窗外飄，心裏想想糟糕！又要捱一天的雨！</p>
<p>在上海，雨給我的印象實在太壞了。上海本來是利害來往的場所，大部分人攘攘擾擾，天天在利害塲中賽跑，本也無悠閒的心情來關懷天氣的佳惡。但晴天總好於雨天，這是大家該能同意的罷丨無論是亭子間中閒得百無聊賴的詩人，或是寫字房裏忙得不得開交的業務員，在晴天總還有機會對着青空一片一片飄浮着的白雲，做着甜美的春夢；雨天可不然，它給你的，祗是悶，濁，濕，無可奈何的感覺，每個人張着苦臉對住灰黑的天空嘆氣，無論室内，街上，總是使你不舒服。</p>
<p>但這是單就上海而言，在有些地方，下雨决不十分討厭；像我們故鄉的山中，下雨倒是有趣不過的事。</p>
<p>小時候，遇着這樣的雨天，我最喜歡立在廂樓上眺望：樓下面是溪，溪水有些混濁，滔滔地流去，在沙岩上噴着白沫；對面是山，峯巒間時常吐出一塊一塊的雲，顏色形狀，各各不同；遠處的山被雲霧迷濛着；雨掛在眼前好像一幅紗簾。古舊的屋角，張着蛛網，網上絡着許多晶瑩的水珠：塘裏鴨子彎着頭頸，整理羽毛，響亮而愉快地啼着。姐姐們在樓下織帶或繡花，母親在外間紡紗。紡車的聲音，與階前的雨聲相應和。我身上被雨水潤透了，一會兒啃年糕，一會兒挨在母親身上吵這樣，要那樣，母親總是温和地微笑着：同樣的雨天，但那多幸福，多可懷念呵！</p>
<p>三年前，旅居東京，也是這樣的一個雨天，我坐在草蓆上，靠着火缸。小小的四疊半房内，充滿着異國情調。我靜靜地聽着打在屋頂鉛皮上的雨音，不知不覺地有了一般遊浪人所共有的鄉愁旅恨。正當凄凉欲絶的時候，驀地從那裏送來了一陣歌聲，婉轉妙曼，這是島國最流行的小唄「紅屋之孃！」同樣的雨天，但那多幽美，多麽富於詩意呵！</p>
<p>現在一切都完了，一切都成了無從摸捉的陳跡，旣看不到故鄉的美景，也聽不着異國的情歌，祇埋伏在這醜惡都會裏的闇黑的一角，聽那連綿的春雨，無情地，頑固地滴着，滴着，使人鬱悶，煩燥，感慨無盡！</p>
<h3>故鄉雜記</h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>三、我的家和玲姑娘的家</p>
<p>十點鐘左右的時候，我們坐了火車到慈谿去。這古怪的魚和鹽的城市給我們扔在後面了。那地方的火車的車廂比滬杭滬甬兩線要小得多，也慢得多，可是我們只坐了一刻鐘，已經到了慈谿。我差一點又笑了出來；自家兒好像在做滑稽電影的主角似的，一心以爲只少得坐兩三個鐘頭的，那知道抽完一枝烟就到了。出了火車站，我們就走出了二十世紀。那麽悠長的一條窄石路在前面伸展着，一頂轎子浮在上面，向山影那面移去，走到中世紀的古夢裏去似的。</p>
<p>車站離我們家還有七里路，那座空鎖了八年的院子就在那兒，鄉人們也許在門口等着我們去吃中飯呢。那盆馬蘭一定開了，因爲田野裏已經開滿了黄菜花，布榖的呌聲已經在春風裏蕩漾着了。</p>
<p>我們急急的走着，慢慢兒的，我們家的白院牆在菜花裏峙了起來，門前池塘裏的青苔隱隱地反映着古銅色的太陽光。</p>
<p>「到家了！這回可眞的到家了！」</p>
<p>我們三個弟兄撒開腿便跑，再也管不了在後邊兒看山水的老伯父啦。跑着跑着，那道白院牆越加清楚了，門前那條小河上的橋上坐着的人也看得清楚了！我們的家就在那兒。我們的家就在那兒呵！</p>
<p>跑到門口，忽然好幾條狗衝着我們吠起來，屋子裏邊的人一面斥着狗，一面瞧着我們，就像不認識我們似的，過了會才笑了起來，指着我們說這是誰的兒子，那是誰的兒子。我們也管不了許多，便直衝了進去，到了屋子裏，伯母她們已經先我們三天到了，正預備了茶水在等我們呢。我臉也不洗，便跑到花廳那兒去，那株橘樹開得比從前更茂盛啦，院子裏的一棵大菩提樹長得高過了屋子，那盆馬蘭花繞着我的脚。她們還是認識我的，因爲她們愉快地笑了。我默默的站在那兒，童年的記憶依依地跑了回來。我曾經在這菩提樹下聽祖母講過故事的，我曾經在那邊兒那間小屋子裏偷甘蔗吃過的，也曾經在這院子裏騎了那支呌阿黄的大狗算是中了探花遊街去的。現在我是二十二歲的年青人咧，祖母可死了，阿黄也死了，屋柱也像比從前老了些了丨記憶是會跑回來的，現實是不會再回來的。</p>
<p>下午我們到一個姑母家裏去。我們一共有七個人，嘻嘻哈哈地在田野裏走着。姑母家是寗波的大族，也就是玲姑娘的家，小時候曾經去過一次的，已經没什麽印象了，這一次又能跑去，我覺得船上那一晚受擠也算不了什麽了。　　那屋子眞是大得可怕，進了大門到姑母的屋子裏，單那陰暗的走廊就走了半天。那些屋子我好像都認識的，因爲姑娘是在這兒生長的。我一面去，一面看；我想知道那一間屋子是玲姑娘生長的地方。那些庭院裏，屋子裏，全没一個人，慘淡的，鎖着深秋的凉意似的。一拐灣走進了姑母的屋子，已經呌她看見了，抱了孫女笑着迎了出來。差不多有三年没看見她了，玲姑娘死了以後就没上她家去過。</p>
<p>她們談了一會，就打起牌來，我獨自個兒坐在窗口抱着她的孫女玩。很好玩的一個女孩子呢。很高興同我在一起，却又怕羞，那一種似眞非眞的模樣兒，那麽地和玲姑娘相像呵！那孩子也四歲了，是的，玲姑娘已經死了三年了。她現在正靜靜的躺在萬國公墓的大理石下。　　姑母看我跟她玩得高興，便笑着說：「你倒　　很喜歡她的。我是很喜歡她的，因爲她也有　　紫丁香的眷戀味！</p>
<p>不知道多　起的，窗外下着細雨，屑屑地。闌珊的雨聲裏，天暗了下來；對着這昏黄的燈光，我覺得每一點雨珠都滴在我的心上面，每一滴雨都在我的心裏引起了舊日的思戀，舊日的惆悵。</p>
<p>我是在玲姑娘家裏；玲姑娘呢？玲姑娘呢？　　紫丁香的眷戀味呵！</p>
<p>又硬着頭皮和那孩子玩起洋娃娃來了。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>「就在弄堂口走走，看老曹回來了麽。」</p>
<p>「老曹今晚上不回來，又怎樣？」</p>
<p>「：：：：：：」</p>
<p>「林先生，你眞是個循規蹈矩的好青年。」她似乎是在嘲笑他。</p>
<p>「：：：我可不能像林先生那樣假正經的。：：：」</p>
<p>「：：：：：：」</p>
<p>海泉看見秋英抬起上半身來了，儘望着他笑。他像受了極重的壓力，抬起頭來。他本是有了相當的决意，唯恐太晚了，没有充分的時間。他想，曹世光該回來了吧。</p>
<p>「你怎樣？」</p>
<p>他雖然這樣地問她，但同時感着周身發了一陣又一陣的惡寒。夜深了，天氣也的確冷了些。他的牙齒戰　着相擊，琢琢地作響。他的說話都不能成音了。</p>
<p>「我嗎，：：：」她打了一個呵欠，把臉埋在雙掌裏了。「我只想在天空中跳舞。無論在任何時候，我一面跳舞一面看下面有多少多悅意的男子。假如是我悅意的，我定要蹴他一脚，丨丨過後我就要在這些男子的頭上跳舞了。阿曹只是在這許多男性裏面立於中心的一個。：：：　　海泉想，她的說話是何等的荒唐。原來她是想向自已的頭上蹴一脚的。他此刻才覺悟他正立於深淵的面前。他想反問她一些話，但是上下兩列牙齒相擊得十分厲害，無論怎樣也說不成話了。</p>
<p>「林先生，你覺得冷麽？不要儘立在那裏，坐進來吧。被窩」裏暖和些。：：：」</p>
<p>她說着伸動了一下她的下顎，表示呌他坐到她的對面，丨丨床的那一頭去。</p>
<p>但是只一瞬間，他禁不住又撲向她面前去。剛吻着她的冷濕的口唇那瞬間，忽然聽見下面有人在搥門，並且搥得異常的猛烈。</p>
<p>他俩都驚呆了。</p>
<p>「林先生，你下去看看好麽？」</p>
<p>「好的。」</p>

<p>標紗花急急回高</p>
<p>風傳廠方有相當維持辦法</p>

<p>昨日美電紐約交易所生絲價格與其他物價同時飛漲、本月最高價開一元四角半、較十八日漲百分之十三、横濱昨日現貨開八百十五元、亦漲百分之八、本埠因美金低落百分之六、各出口商前日所發之絲電、昨日電轉者均須虧折購進、如美國漲風站定、華絲自有上漲可能、惟美國物價上升、全因美政府重申禁金出口令、及通貨有膨脹可能之故、惟壓低美金價格、對於出超之美國是否有益、亦屬疑問、今美國人民抬高物價、如太猛晋、將來反動之來、恐亦甚烈、故絲價在最近期間、繼續上升、固屬意中事、然能否持久、則亦未可知也、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>河下米市靜定之局</p>
<p>丨陰元跌二角之譜丨</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三四十號、市况站定僅陰元以向日轟之太足、物極必反、價格慘落二角之譜、至若蘇同粳及南港厚稻以零胃作客雖有、但納胃數微、市價平定、其高貨稍覺鮮色耳、薄稻大都包胃去路、尤屬北洋帮辦去、南洋未動、如唐山·天津·烟台·青島等帮採取一千七八百包、其貨皆屬青角·松江·泗涇·西練等米、但客家吃盤嚴厲、兼之售方以來源較夥、不無軟手相脫、致價再居定局、無甚軒輊、杜洋尖及各花色平穩無榮辱而已、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來約十八九號、白粳走化平常、市形稍帶疲勢、薄粳到少消化、價挺立、早稻及秈米仍定立陰白元到貨無幾零化尚可、價又見緊扣、</p>
<h3>津帮試辦湖南米</h3>
<p>昨日客秈客化續活、但比前日去數略減、因閩帮又擬擯小之故、綂市開出一千五百餘包、高貨站住、中次略平、惟閩帮之外、本街亦有問津、更有津帮到市試辦湖南機紅米一百包、價開七元九角半、此批到津如能消通、則後首當有繼續交易、因此昨日閩化雖淡、人心反爲望好、蓋閩帮之外、又有天津及本街之繼續辦購希望也、本街去　南　紅米一百五十包、價六元七角九分、閩帮去湖南　汕二百四十五包、價七元二角半、又糙油一百七十包、價七元半、江西機晚共開八百多包、價七元九角半至七元半、由閩帮與本街分去云、</p>
<h3>粉價回好一二分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午微呈穩定之象、以洋麥報價驟好七八角不等、因此業外人心活動、買氣雖不暢、市價逐步盤上、各盤中近期見平、遠期則好五厘至一分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份因小廠抵進、市價亦　盤逐上、遠期因廠出不多、外行人心仍好、至開價又復步佳、此種漲度、似全爲洋麥報價所帶起、因實銷仍未轉暢也、且金價暴落七八十元、此後國外匯兌、放長無疑、故現洋麥之兜售、亦必乘此機會、又將源源訂購矣、結果本月份較前日漲一分、五月份漲五厘、六月份漲一分、七月份漲一分半、八月份漲一分七厘半、九月份漲二分云、</p>
<h3>小麥前途變化多</h3>
<p>昨日期麥大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥雖報漲七八角之巨、惟以吸户甚少、内地帮購買力、已經絶跡、本埠各廠又有直接定成之洋麥、標準需要、自不注意、所以各盤買氣、仍未見旺、且阿根庭洋麥定價仍祇三兩二錢半、又值金市暴落中、恐前途正多變化也、結果本月份較前日未動、五六月份未開、七月份小一分、八月份好一分、九月份較週二則好四分云、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>青鉛定價飛漲</p>
<p>青鉛昨來價暴漲二金元七角半、計每噸需美金四十一金元半、聞其漲價原因、受點錫市飛漲而帶高、但昨市本埠美匯突升、市價方面依然無甚上落、現每担價仍開十六元四角、交易除茶帮微有收辦外、别帮無點綴者、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>好貨說</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>一提起好貨二字，似乎有一點不大好聽，因爲好貨云者，就不免是利慾薰心，所以正人君子總不肯輕口道出，雖然在心理正是無可形容的歡喜。那末正人君子旣經如此，於是不敢以正人君子自居者更不待言，所以殺人越貨，層出不窮，正是此理。</p>
<p>其實在目前和有制度的社會中，好貨一事，本來不必諱言，陞官發財，爲的是好貨，掠城奪城，爲的是好貨，臉上塗著厚厚的雪花膏而和顯宦達官的姨太太勾勾搭搭，也無非爲的是好貨，甚至於手裏敲着算盤而口口聲聲勸人「國貨救國」者，尤其爲的是好貨。</p>
<p>很顯然的，誰不好貨，誰便在現實社會中無以自存，因爲「鏡花緣」中的君子國，究竟是文人的幻想，何况「道德」「禮讓」，到現在已經不復是醉人的鴉片了。</p>
<p>所以，好貨之道，現在正是精益求精，只差一點，就是大家還不肯直捷爽快的說出來。</p>
<p>就拿最近的事情來說；張委員同志在這次中央諸公歡送出國之先，「越權盜賣」了海軍醫院，以及將頣和園的古字畫順手帶走，眞是再明白没有，爲的是好貨。盜賣海軍醫院，進賬當然可觀，而古董字畫，其賣價天然也就不小。不過張委員同志，究竟還是年輕，做事不免不大老靠。譬如說，這次「盜賣」問題只在「越權」，假如事先能夠不「越權」的三面言定，大家分贓，那末此中秘密，一時總還不至於連我們老百姓也會知道。次之，如順手牽羊，帶走幾樣東西做做紀念，本是我們中國的官塲慣例，但是他却當着這最爲注重古董救國而將上海租界成爲保險箱的情形之下，而不肯和保管委員多咬幾口耳朶，當然少不了被人主張扣留的。固然這不過是各自推卸而狗咬輸家的呌吠一通而已，實際上對於我們的張委員同志仍是萬分客氣而且器重，反正大家都是自家人，總好說話；但是這樣一來，却多少增加了他過於好貨的證鐵。</p>
<p>其次，也還有只圖唯貨是好而不顧一切者，最顯然的便是最近又是軍長的湯玉麟將軍。勒種罌粟，請日人技師來創辦嗎啡工廠，當然爲的是好貨。其後因爲只要「决心抗日」後方便有充分接濟，同時二千萬戰債，也只要一次「表示」，便可到手，於是不成問題，馬上「决心抗日」。復其後承德危急，日人弄假成眞，於是爲了自已的身家財産，便不能不綑載細軟，星夜逃走。再其後，仔細打聽，各位「民族英雄」的進賬，到底還是不壞，於是現在又打定主意，「準備反攻」，戴罪立功而向中央討封號了。當然，中央諸公，都是寛洪量大，就給他一個軍長名義，就再給他一個賺錢的機會。這樣看來，楊玉麟老將軍竟是一個武人，很少做涵養工夫，對於好貨一道，未免太露骨了。</p>
<p>然而說來說去，像這樣國難繼續延長下去，畢竟是好貨者大好年頭。雖然有許多人出於没法也買了一個「航空救國」徽章，但是也有不少的大人老爺們趁此機會稱了好貨的心願。嗚呼丨此所謂之「國難」。</p>

<h3>春</h3>
<p>— 守璞</p>
<p>春來了，帶來了人間的愉快。淡淡的太陽，軟軟的風，佈滿了人間煦和的愛。一切有情的生物丨人們，鳥們，花草們，都在這薄醉似的春風裏跳躍着，是誰也覺得時序是變了。</p>
<p>但歡樂都給人戴了去，落在我身上的只是凄凉，寂寞。</p>
<p>短短的一生，誰也數過二十多個春，但從没有留下一個可愛的回憶，日子全像在夢中走過一樣，春於我是全孤負了。</p>
<p>早歲，丨在母親的壞抱裏，該是快樂的吧？然而那時因母親生病，據說乳最少吃，啼哭想是不免的，但號咷終勝於飲泣，我終於很愉逸地從父母的愛護之下長大起來，至今也追尋不出那時所殘留的絲毫悲傷的影子。往後呢？就糊裏糊塗的隨着日子旋轉，一直到現在。　　在過去的許多日子中。儘壓榨或許還找得出一些淡淡的影子，但太淡了，細看終於是一片模糊。</p>
<p>記得是那一年的春天吧，伊來信說元宵後來Ｓ地可相見。那時眞想安排過一個好好的春天，可是又因他的病而粉碎了九十日的春光，到他病愈時，渴愛的櫻花已零落迨盡，相對惘然，此後呢，就不曾思量過。任花開花謝，全不曾刻劃下一些痕跡，時序的變遷於我全不發生感想，不過到冬風吹來時覺得更冷一些罷了。於今萍飄南北，算來已四五年了，舊情如昨，時日已非，夢一般的人生，讓他夢一般的過去吧丨追挽是徒然的。</p>
<p>現在，春又來到人間，春風重燃燒起人們的熱情，一切有情的生物，又在歡欣鼓舞，綠色也輕輕浮上樹梢頭。但在都市裏，除了春風普遍地吹着外，是找不出其他的特徵的，煤屑和柏油的路，永遠長不起一顆青草，骨立道旁的樹，也帶着都市的病態，全不像鄉間所見的那麽雄偉，唉，都市的生活原像柏油路一樣的灰色呵，遙想這時我那浙西明媚的故鄉的田野，該已是綠遍了吧？趁着這爛漫的春光，我祝福伊能多少的領略，日子是很容易消失的呵丨</p>
<h3>中國日前的三條出路</h3>
<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>南開大學校長，天津地方協會會長張伯苓先生，最近曾對記者發表他的談話。他對記者說：「我人對此嚴重局勢，僅有三路可行：一爲直接交涉，二爲收復失地，三爲誓死抵抗。然以目前國際之惡劣局面，縱政府欲遷就交涉，人民亦必堅决反對，至於收復失地，在軍事上經濟上，均尚無充分之準備，無從談起，殆無可諱，故唯一之康莊大道，厥惟拚命抵抗而已」丨</p>
<p>張先生到底是上了年紀的人，他昔年曾對學生們說：「南開大學是我開辦的，我要怎麽便怎麽，你們敢怎麽的？」可是，如今小日本奪去了東三省，熱河，沿長城各口岸之後，全國人民正在謀誓死收復失地，我們的張先生却爲了軍事上，經濟上之無充分準備，奈何小日本不得，便只好巴望着和小日本言歸於好，彼此馬馬虎虎了事了。可恨小百姓没有知識不識時務，否則我們乖巧的</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>張先生早就喊出：「直接交涉」的口號來了！如今爲了小百姓的堅决反對，便不得不放棄這條路，而走第三條路了。</p>
<p>「長期抵抗」，「誓死抵抗」，不但武人們會喊，連文人們也喊起來了。原因是爲了這條「誓死抵抗」之路，是合乎中庸之道的。旣然奈何小日本不得，小百姓的堅决反對又不敢與日本直接交涉，正是外以懼日，内以懼民，在這二難之中，只好擇乎中庸之道而處之了！於是「誓死抵抗」，「長期抵抗」，「一面交涉，一面抵抗」乃惟一之康莊大道焉！</p>
<p>東三省，熱河，姑且送給日本人不提，等小日本打到長城口再抵抗，萬一小日本打進了長城，最好先放棄北平，天津，因爲平津地勢平坦，無險可守，　氣四　　　　　出洋</p>
<p>而且處處有被敵人包圍之慮，故放棄平津非戰敗也，乃爲戰略的關係，不得不退守第二道防線以備抵抗也！</p>
<p>到了小日本打進北平，天津竟可以退守舊日豐，鎬之地，再事抵抗。到了豐，鎬不守，倘若小日本仍然節節進逼，盡可以退入玉門關把守，以備抵抗。總之日人打到那裏，我們便抵抗到那裏，這便是長期抵抗的眞義，這便是四方八面處處顧到的一種中庸辦法，我眞不能不拜服張先生的妙論卓見。</p>
<h3>廣告的藝術</h3>
<p>— 毓</p>
<p>許多人談過處世藝術，不外風馬牛三部曲。其實風馬牛還是處世的理論，你得應用放程式化爲實際，纔是處世的藝術，不然　風頭出　木　，有一切意料所不及的危險，拍馬當然有拍上馬脚之可虞，牛而吹破，即尊駕臉厚而未及於醉，也已失牛之眞諦矣。所謂藝術云云者，你熟讀了（A+B）2　Ａ２＋２ＡＢ＋Ｂ２之外，還能應用（２＋３）２　２２＋２３＋３２之放程式，則可謂深得藝術之三味；對於廣告，亦何獨不然！</p>
<p>譬如寳號是綢緞舖，你見隔隣同業吹着可憐的秋香而生意鼎盛；於是你拍着胸脯說：「敝人以人格擔保，他們賣的是日本貨，敝號才是道地的國貨，而且價格便宜，自從開店以來，童叟無欺，要買國貨的愛國志士，快到我們這裏來！」那是你喊破喉嚨，也不會見主顧上門。這是你雖然知道了廣告的藝術，但不會應用藝術的放程式。應用藝術的放程式若何？曰：</p>
<p>在各報封面登起大幅廣告，敝號因存貨堆積如山，不顧血本，大放盤一星期（一星期後，可以再登廣告，因各界要求，忍痛犧牲，繼續一星期，機會難再，切勿錯過。）打五個九折之外，再加贈品。并於每日九時三十時，大拍賣一小時，毛葛旗袍料，每件一元，以一千件售完爲限。華達呢袍料，每件二元，以五百件爲限，各種布疋，足尺加五）等。保你拉上鐵門，夥計喘不過氣來應酬，一切賣不掉的舊貨，出清大吉，袋中麥克，何樂而不爲？不過作者預先聲明，毛葛旗袍料一千件及華達呢袍料五百件，不必眞有其事，十件也好，五件也好，甚至不件也好。無他，惟藝術之放程式而已。不信，有廣告爲證：</p>
<p>這幾天不是跳舞當道嗎？你也肉感，香艷，他也魂消，意蕩，色情狂的朋友不知踏進那一家好；於是有熟讀藝術放程式之廣告曰：「研究藝術化的美舞，打倒賣淫式的歌舞，香艷肉美秘密浴室。」</p>
<p>浴室已夠神秘，無妨秘密。打倒賣淫式者。激將法也。作者昨晚八時過陳英士紀念塔下，該院已拉上鐵門，而門外人頭，自行人道迄馬路中心，五路電車正踏鈴蛇行也。失隅觀衆，今晚七時，或將公候該院門前矣。</p>

<p>合夥糾紛</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>鄙人於去年五月間，與楊君合夥開設ＸＸ分售處；言定股本洋陸百元，各出一半。日後如須增加資本，各半負擔。當開辦時，各先付洋二百元，乃着手裝修，購置生財，開始營業。嗣於六月間，又各出洋一百元，由楊君向總公司訂立合同，並繳付保證金洋二百元。詎開業以來，楊君對於店務，毫不顧問，按月却向店中支用薪水十元。待十一月中，又發覺所謂由楊君交付之保證金，已被移用，並未繳去；所以總公司方面，即將敝店應得佣金，扣作保證金。因之敝店經濟，幾至無法維持，當由鄙人借欵墊下。乃迭向追取，彼則一味延宕，迄今一載，尚無切實表示；合夥議單，亦延不商訂。現在鄙人亟須與楊君辦清手續，一時想不出簡捷辦法。故此專函懇求，希即見敎爲荷。此請</p>
<p>撰安　臧雪華謹啓</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：一個人吃了虧，當然要設法交涉，求所以回復之者。「寛容大度」雖則有這麽一句話，但事上誰都不會願意呢。不過交涉雖則要交涉，還有一件事，比交涉更要緊的，就是要使這種吃虧的事實，立時中止，不再延續。因爲已往的吃虧，終是有限，未來的損失，才無底止呀丨至於交涉的手腕，首在知已知彼，估量對方的能力。提出的條件，必定要爲對方所能辦到的，否則要求由你要求，他因爲無力接受，事情不免延擱。根據上面的理論，「認虧了結」，實在是辦交涉的不二法門。所以我們以爲臧君現在也不必向楊君追索，看來他或許是眞的拿不出了。你現在不妨由他折股；以前他支的乾薪，不必追究；他拿出了三百塊錢的資本，移用了二百塊錢的保證金，算來還有一百元的資本，你不妨直捷爽快，還了他。從此一刀兩斷，這爿店由你作主，乾薪也可以不客氣了。此後你有力量的話，不妨獨做。否則另外物色一個正正式式的人，同你這種不死不活的局面呢！</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（三十三續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（十四）父親與白眼</p>
<p>這一日的晚上，伍逸破例的在七點鐘之後，才回到自已的家裏，其時他夫人劉女士，和他兩位公子，丨伍源伍蒙丨已聚在餐室裏恭候着他了。</p>
<p>「爸爸丨你把王國棟帶到什麽地方去了」？伍源的性子簡直比他令尊更燥，伍逸還没有歸座，他已迫不及待的催問起來了：說話的聲氣，差不多像一個警官向當小賊的追問一件贓物一樣的生硬。劉女士聽了，也覺得很不自然，以爲伍逸免不得要着惱了，忙抬起頭來，堆着一種含有調解性的微笑，向他看着；不料他竟像不曾聽見一般的毫無表示，而且特别的可怪，他的一張很瘦削而不很黑的老臉上，竟是出乎意外的不像往日一樣的泛着赤色的酒容，尤其使劉女士不勝駭異，以致於無可自慰的駕慌起來！</p>
<p>的確，伍逸今天是例外的不曾喝酒，他已把喝酒的時間分騰出來，辦就了一椿緊急的事故。此刻，他自已心上已覺得很滿足，很愉快，同時却又極矛盾地感覺到一種不能形容的空洞，彷彿是失掉了一件什麽無代價的東西似的迷惘，恍惚。</p>
<p>「今天比往常遲了一個鐘頭了」丨劉女士也從他的滯呆的舉止上，看到他内心上的變態了，便不敢放棄她做妻子的責任，輕輕地走過去，把他扶在一張大藤椅上坐了，很温柔地撫慰着他。</p>
<p>伍逸像經過了一番長途的跋涉以後一樣的衰疲，雖然已把全身的體重，托付了他座下的大藤椅，可是依舊不住的在深深地喘着，原有的老當益壯的精神，似乎是因爲他今天不曾喝酒而溜走了。</p>
<p>小兒子忙給他斟了一杯茶，大兒子也祇得暫時容忍着，不敢再作進一步的追問。</p>
<p>「素珍，校裏的事情，想來源兒已經告訴你了！」休息了十多分鐘之後，伍逸才自動的打破了沉寂的空氣，很莊重地向他夫人說道：「你可知道那王國棟是誰？」</p>
<p>「不知道啊！」劉女士底眞誠的答復。因爲伍逸旣不曾把小麟進Ｘ大的消息告訴過他，而且根本也没有提起過王國棟就是小麟的話，她當然是猜想不到的了。</p>
<p>「他就是小麟，丨菊芬的孩子丨」伍逸像畫龍點睛似的說明了這一個大關鍵。他二個兇子雖不懂得其中的曲折，劉女士一聽，却就恍然大悟，立刻知道今天伍逸的所以竭力袒護王國棟的緣故了：但是她雖然明白，也没有什麽不快的感覺，或是不滿意的表示，也許是她原籍並非鎭江的關係，所以始終怕嘗醋的味道，伍逸當日跟菊芬整天混在一起的時候，她旣不曾說過半個不字，此刻菊芬已死了，伍逸祇是給她照顧照顧孩子，當然更無喝醋的必要了丨</p>

<h3>瑙瑪希拉口中的瓊克勞馥</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉和瓊克勞馥二人，都是米高梅公司的基本演員，他們因爲站在同一的地位，所以有人說她們二人暗中競爭異常劇烈。最大的原因，爲瑙瑪和瓊雖同在一個公司做事，但她們二人，從來很少在一起談話或玩耍的時候。外界因他二的疏遠，就疑及她們暗中各懷着意見，但是現在瑙瑪表示，她和瓊絲毫没有什麽爭奪地位的心。瑙瑪一生行爲毫不苟且，心地坦白，當然他說的，並非假意掩飾的話。</p>
<p>瑙瑪說：「瓊克勞馥雖則和我都在米高梅，但我的光陰是極有限的。我家裏的事一一安置妥當了，剩下來的時間才是我工作的片刻。瓊和我不同，她勤於工作，家政另有别人管理，况且没有孩子，只安心在攝片塲中。所以我的工作時間常在家中，而瓊則終日工作於攝影塲中，閒暇也很少。因此二人終年没有暢叙的一天，但感情是絶對不壞，但在一起的時候少，無怪外面猜我們二人爭名奪譽了，」</p>
<p>「瓊克勞馥是我心中最認爲完善的朋友。他的和藹忠實是好萊塢人人稱道的。他從來没有跟那一個過不去的。我雖不是天天和她見面接談，但她的性情，我完全知道的，我呢？更不知道怎樣去妒忌人家，或是怨恨人家。並且我也没有這許多功夫去用心思。我和瓊二人的藝術誰高誰底，是要大衆公平的跟光來評定的，難道一爭奪就高了嗎？我想瓊是絶没有這心，我是自知不會這一套心腸，我自認我和瓊是很好的朋友，瓊也不會嫌我而棄我的，」</p>
<p>「在虚名一方面，我雖被推爲米高梅皇后，但是徒負虚名。我的工作實在太少了。自從去年的「紅粉飄零」完成後，直到現在方演了一部「笑的經過Smiling　Through　。還是盡力的經濟光陰，拿許多家務呌柴爾伯管理後凑出時間來的。至於瓊的作品，「大飯店」之後有「雨」和「笑罪人」和新近的「婦心」Turnabout。雖然「雨」是福克斯公司借瓊去拍的，但也是米高梅公司的光榮。所以我自認不如瓊。我自知她比我勤勞，我敬重她，並没妒恨他。我尤其敬重她的待人接物，並不拿紅星自居，而以驕傲待人。」</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「賽珍會」（State　Fair）</h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>很顯然的，整個的經濟恐慌，並不將電影工業除爲例外，於是美國的製片商人也就不能不以「明星」來極力號召，雖然他們或她們本來都是獨當一面而個别的成爲各個影片的主角，但是在目前經濟崩潰的浪潮之下，也就不得不降格一點，而與許多「明星」在一個片中出演了。</p>
<p>先有了米高梅的「大飯店，」現在又有了社斯的「賽珍會。」</p>
<p>因爲本片的「明星」是如此之多，而又不便將誰降格爲配角，於是爲了適合這種特殊條件，那末編劇者也就得編成一部能夠容納許多主角的劇本。關於這一點，我想或許有人說：」這個片子是没有主角的，」果然如此，那末我相信他一定忽視了福斯公司所以要攝製這一部片子的主要原因。</p>
<p>如上述，本片的主角旣是如此之多，那末導演亨利金（Henry　King）便得對於各個明星分别注意，最好是還得非常平均。於是導演爲了面面周到，在賽珍會的素描中，必須三方面都要顧及，同時在編輯上不免稍事麻煩的了。因爲本劇是以喜劇的形式演出，在情調上不必如何莊重其事，所以導演必須使全劇非常熱閙，甚至於隨時揷入極其自然的笑料。但是他對於兩對男女愛情的描寫，却不見如何活潑。主要的是相同的塲面未免大多，如新聞記者和瑪姬在飛車上擁抱，却金複到三次以上。然而小山上的情話二次，其内容却各不同，當然是比較夠味的。其他如瑪姬在新闻記者的肩上樂極忘形，以及惠恩和伊蜜蘭的一夜温情，只聞人聲，不見人影，而畫面上却以春風吹拂窗幔以增進温柔的情調，的確是非常美麗而生動的。</p>
<p>關於表演，我不欲多說。反正各個明星都有他固有的成績。燈光是最值得注意的，全都是那樣幽靜而柔和。</p>
<p>至於本片的含義，那末通篇一貫的諷刺乃是不容我們忽視的。老年夫婦的名利心，商人們的强調的呌喊，評判員的醜態，惠恩於失戀之後仍然勉就舊歡，最嚴酷的居然以猪的春情來說明少年男女的熱狂。</p>
<p>像這樣輕描淡寫的作品，居然能得着如許成績，當然我們得承認這是美國片中比較特殊的收獲。但是製片者之苦心，我們也是十分了解的吧。</p>
<h3>評「她的心」</h3>
<p>— 愛蓮</p>
<p>「她的心」是多詩麽意的一個名字！可是對這張片子，這種題名却是太寛泛而不切實了。　　以月明公司的地位，資本，等各方面說，這張片非但比「關東大俠」「女鏢師」等片，高明不少，就是最近公映的「大丈夫」也不及這一張。這可見她著著進步的階段。</p>
<p>在小公司的出品中，故事總是很冗長的，的確故事一長，可以省却導演不少心血，本事是這樣的：</p>
<p>一個好虚榮的女郎，她父親是一個學校的校董，某届，畢業生，有一個才貌雙全的青年，他們戀愛了。不過校董的一個書記，也鍾　於女郎，所以演成了三角戀愛。書記又用了選美會的功臣來要挾女郎，並用流氓强將女郎綁去。那時少年和女郎的堂兄，也用警察來擒拿他們。結果當然才子佳人，成了眷屬。</p>
<p>這一個劇情，雖然不夠什麽諷刺味，然而大致上還看得過去。組織上也可以及格了。</p>
<p>導演是月明的老閭任彭年，他對於這種社會劇，是很生疏的，所以錯誤在所不免，穿揷也不好，剪接也談不到藝術。</p>
<p>演員中最重要的是飾那女郎的新進明星？霍斐倫，她是很美麗的，初上鏡頭，雖然有許多過於做作的地方，這却是導演應當負責的。她本人的天才，覺得還不錯，少年羅克朋，在這片中，比在「大丈夫」　進步了一些，但是表面還差得多，只有打是他的拿手好戲。再次要的角色更必談，似乎太文明戲化了。</p>
<p>攝影平常，光線仍是日光，雖然字幕中一再促到，夜深，但是絲毫不像夜景，佈景有幾幕很不壞，有一些却是假得一望而知。字幕還不多，可是措詞上太欠研究。中央大戲院配的音樂也是無聊之至。</p>
<p>這劇中不倫不類地方極多，特别是服飾，如富翁的姪少少，簡直是流氓打扮，而流氓中，反西裝革履，丰采翩翩。漏洞更多，如末尾的大打一塲，簡直是作戲。手槍彈打在臉上，除了一點黑漬以外，連血都没有。滑稽的穿揷不但不會呌人笑，反誤了劇情。總之，這些都是弄巧成拙。</p>
<p>在後半部中很可緊張，但是外景如跑路等</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，攝得太多，反覺鬆懈。</p>
<p>末尾我以爲這種大團圓的結束，的確是低級趣味歡迎，而且一切技術也只有呌低級觀念的人認爲滿意而已。所以我希望月明公司再須努力前進。</p>
<h3>華雷斯皮萊與白象</h3>
<p>華·明·</p>
<p>十六歲時候的華雷斯皮萊跟了他的父親在工人一起混·他父親是個苦工，華雷斯找了一個牧象的工作。那時候華雷斯祇想做一輩子的牧象夫，恐怕他夢中也没有想到好萊塢這個地方呢！</p>
<p>動物之中白象的皮是第一個厚皮·其他的動物用鞭子打幾下也知道痛苦，惟有白象打毁了鞭子也不容易馴服。因爲這緣故，牧白象的人，没有忍耐心是絶對不能勝任的。華雷斯起初到牧場，塲主不知道他的性格，呌他管理白象。華雷斯在工人一起混大的，自然帶些粗暴的習氣。起初的幾天苦得不得了。不料華雷斯皮萊居然整整做了二十多年的牧象夫，訓練成功了一個能忍耐而奸詐多謀隨機應變有時又很誠懇的性格。這許多都是他今日在影界中能獨樹一幟的立足點，没有人能和他對抗的奇怪的作風。</p>
<p>華雷斯前程的大關鍵當然是一部「大飯店」，但是他能和好萊塢的第一等名角葛萊泰嘉寳巴里摩爾兄弟二人瓊克勞馥四大明星並駕齊驅於同一地位的原因，實在是起源在「舐犢深情」一片的成績。在「舐犢深情」中華雷斯和賈克古伯二人曾受美國影片藝術科學研究院的一九三二年嘉奬。同時這一片是華雷斯皮萊幸運的發源處。</p>
<p>「大飯店」一片中我們得到華雷斯的印象又深了一層。他發揮資本家陰惡的手段，恰是他對待白象的手段所化。奸詐的態度畢肖，各報也已定論。</p>

<p>自從巨哥斯拉夫尼哥丁地方，把燒猪運到貝爾格蘭特地方以後，一般影迷，對於香氣觸鼻的燒猪，便發生了一種特殊的嗜好。</p>
<p>但一般的影迷，吃了燒猪以後，爲節省費用起見，大家不看電影了。結果，影戲院門可羅雀，而那些老閭，便想出些特殊的方法來吸引看客。</p>
<p>有一個老閭，便刊登了巨幅廣告，說是到影戲館中去看影戲的，都可不取分文，贈送燒猪一片。</p>
<p>然而同時有一家酒館，却發明了一種對策，他在酒館中，造了一間房子映電影，到他酒館裏去吃燒猪的，都可免費看電影。這樣一來，影戲院的生意，便搶得干凈。</p>
<p>據說在那酒館之中，白天在暗室中映電影，晚上如果是天晴，在花園裏映，這個法子，當然很新穎，自從實行之後，生意很好，而燒猪的銷數，尤其是驚人了！</p>
<h3>「春潮」前奏曲</h3>
<p>周·敬·之·</p>
<p>「春潮」不久在滬公映的消息傳來後·心兒是如何地欣慰。「春潮」是俄國大文豪屠格湼夫的不朽傑作，現在雖然改做中國劇本，但它的重心·依舊存在，依舊是那樣深刻動人。加之導演鄭應時君嘔心瀝血的從事，益發成爲國産聲片中之異軍突起了。</p>
<p>劇情是：「意志薄弱的年青人·因色情誘惑，而抛棄其愛人，復因備受痛苦，而覺悟前非。然而良心上的譴責，有什麽方法以可彌補呢？一失足成千古恨！」</p>
<p>更值得介紹的，片上發音的清晰，爲從來未有的好記錄，這是顏鶴鳴收的音，我對於他的前途，懷着無限的希望。</p>
<h3>影壇鱗爪</h3>
<p>嵩·靈·</p>
<p>電影界發起聯合製片，籌募「電影號」飛機經費，日前在八仙橋青年會開籌備委員會，議决攝製影片之劇本，題材以宣傳航空救國爲總綱，另分細目，以表現各界對於航空救國之反應及努力。細目暫定農，工，商，學，伶界，乞丐，藝術家，兒童，軍，政，醫生，律師，等十二項，由各公司分任一項或二項，攝製則分任，放映時則仍連貫爲一整部影片。</p>
<p>中國人之研究有聲電影者，有石世磐之「愛絲通，」顏鶴眠之「鶴鳴通，」竺清賢之「清賢式，」及某大學敎授之「史鐸通，」其中已攝影片者，有清賢式之「春風楊柳」及「鶴鳴通」，之「春潮。」兹聞竺清賢爲曁南公司代攝之「爲國爭光」，亦已告竣，其成績較「春風楊柳」進步云。</p>
<p>裘芑香導演，黎明暉主演之「追求」，近日在北京戲院開映，每日均告滿座。該片在新光開映時，第一幕某大學舉行話别會，黎明暉所唱，本爲「何日再相逢」，後因該曲嫌太冗長，音調亦不甚佳，故重行另攝補入。現在北京所映，第一幕黎明暉所唱，已改爲「寒衣曲」矣。</p>
<h3>西人對辱華影片之見解</h3>
<p>新·</p>
<p>西片中侮辱華人之惡風，至近年益熾。所有該項影片，運至中國者，迭被禁映。其爲國人所詬病可知。顧各影片公司猶不臨崖勒馬，反相繼攝製，中美人民之情感，漸爲之破壞，識者憂之。三月十八日美國電影雜誌曾刊一文，爲美國駐滬商務參贊裘林亞拿德對辱華影片之見解。詞正義直，不啻向全美影業下一棒喝。特譯錄其詞於後；</p>
<p>「美國各影片公司，倘能於攝演華人影片時，對中國之風俗，國情社會組織加以正確合理之考察，則中美之邦交與美國在華之利益，將籍之而益鞏固。</p>
<p>「最近影片公司迭接報告，謂攝演華人之影片，在海外遭莫大之惡評與打擊。良以片中描摹華人之處，荒謬百出。或呼華人爲Chinaman或描寫華人背後重辮，甚至對白亦用不堪入耳之「洋涇浜」。再者，描摹華人之嗜賭博，鴉片如命，連及下等齷齪之賭窟烟室怪狀。與綁匪强盜等咸非實情。蓋今日之中國遠非昔日可比。吸鴉片者已絶跡，「洋涇浜」僅出之下等階級之口背後。重辮亦早革除矣。」</p>
<h3>電影小說忠魂錄</h3>
<p>Cavalcade（三）訥·</p>
<p>琪茵和他一同喝着酒，她的心中一片茫茫，亦不知是喜歡，亦不知是憂愁。但這個新世紀，百年重新的第一日第一點鐘，琪茵此後永遠記憶着，那氷雪之夜，遠處的鐘聲，街上遊行的火炬工廠中歡迎新歲的汽笛，僕人們獻給他們的花，羅伯的笑容，小孩子們的滿面驚異，以及一切的一切，但她記得最清切的，是街上唱的奥蘭山的曲子。從此以後，她每天想起這可紀念的一宵，她耳朶邊就聽奥蘭山的歌調。</p>
<p>但她聽了奥蘭山的調兒，胸中的起伏還没有停止，興奮高亢的進行曲，又奏起來了。羅伯雖在大衆之中，唱着「女孩兒們，他是皇后的勇士」。琪茵站在門口聽着，芳心已寸寸碎了。還有在碼頭上的一霎時，琪茵在傷慟麻木的時候，還能覺得她旁邊站着愛倫抱了那小孩子，那有福氣，無愁無慮的小孩子，牠亦不懂得這些到南斐洲的軍士中，有許多將葬身異域，永不回來了。</p>
<p>鑼聲響了，船要啟椗了。羅伯對琪茵說；「我要和你接吻，然後你回轉頭，照常地一壁和我談着話，一壁向前走着，你可以不用回頭看。」</p>
<p>「是的」，琪茵的聲音哽在喉嚨。她和羅伯談著：「我幸虧没有帶小孩子來，他們年齡太幼了，怎知道這許多。喬易不是有些傷風嗎，還是不帶他出來的好。」琪茵嘴裏雖說著不相干的閒話，心中可是如同哭著喊著，要求他不要去。她繼續著談話：「你不在此地了，我知道，我覺得你已走開了，羅伯：：：羅伯：：：」</p>
<p>她連忙回轉頭來，船已徐徐行動，她在一大堆人中，尋找羅伯，但是眼淚汪汪，咫尺之外，卽一物不見，怎能尋得著呢？她覺得愛倫扶住她，愛倫自已的男人，也從軍去了。她們二人，同病相憐，攙扶著一同回到那異樣空虚寂靜的家中。</p>
<p>以後的日月，就全靠愛倫一個人的主持了。她亦有男人在南斐洲打仗，所以她能了解琪茵心中的痛苦。有時她呌孩子們安靜些，讓琪茵睡一些覺；或者逗引著孩子們吵閙地玩著，讓琪茵開一些懷；這都是愛倫處處　護琪茵的用心之處。還聰明仁惠的愛倫，已經不是一個平常的僕婦，而是一個寂寞中的良伴了。</p>

<h3>Skirmishes at Xiaozhang Village and Other Locations</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Abundant Around Shimen</p>
<p>Japanese Take Over Luandong Railway Stations</p>
<p>Luandong Suffers from Continuous Rain, Enemy Aircraft Inactive</p>
<p>(Beiping) From dawn till dusk on the 20th at Lahe Bridge, the enemy continued to bombard our positions with heavy artillery, but their infantry did not advance. Outside Panjiakou, more than two thousand enemy troops have newly arrived, carrying large quantities of bridge-building materials, and are actively requisitioning timber and boats in the vicinity, seemingly preparing to cross the river. At Pingfangzi, there are stationed three to four hundred enemy infantry and cavalry. At Xiaozhang Village, Xiaoying, and the East and West Xia Kou areas, four to five hundred enemy infantry and cavalry were spotted. At 2 PM on the 17th, they briefly engaged our sentries defending the left bank. Dozens of enemy wooden boats were seen at West Xia Kou, carrying large quantities of wood, rice, and other supplies. The enemy seems to be preparing to cross the river between Qian'an and Sahe Bridge. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy has decided to launch a large-scale attack on the North and South Tuan Ting areas, with the Pumu Detachment as the main force, in addition to the Hattori Brigade and part of the Kawahara Unit that participated in the Lengkou battle. The command headquarters is set up at Pingquan, and the forward command headquarters at Kuancheng. The attack will commence as soon as the arrangements are completed. Our Song Department has already made thorough deployments. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Luandong area, enemy and our troops are currently in a standoff at Zhu Ge Zhuang. Our army is now east of the Luan River, hastily building fortifications. Two new reserve brigades have joined the front line. The defenses of western Luan are secure. The enemy troops are currently carrying out "pacification" work in areas such as Qin Island and Lulong, and do not seem to be advancing. The various stations on the Beining Railway in eastern Luan and the Qinhuangdao Customs have been taken over by Japanese personnel. Most of the puppet troops, about four to five thousand men under Li Jichun, are now gathered near Changli. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) On the 20th, Luandong was overcast and rainy all day, with a brief snowfall at noon. The weather was like early winter. The east bank of the river was quiet, with no enemy activity. Enemy aircraft were unable to operate due to the rain. According to observers familiar with the military situation, if the Japanese army is to take Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) by force, it must go through several stages, deploying step by step and making full preparations before launching. As for strategic aspects, whether the Japanese army will take Pingjin from western Luan or invade through Gubeikou and Xifengkou remains a matter of hesitation. Our army has gathered over 100,000 troops in western Luan, and the defenses are solid and without worry. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army recently used the main force of the 6th Division to break through our Lengkou defense line, forcing our army to the Luan River line. The Song Department in the upper reaches of the Luan River has become an exposed salient. Therefore, the Pumu Detachment has been mobilized and concentrated in the Xifengkou area. The Pumu Detachment has already advanced to Kuancheng. Previous reports that the Motegi Cavalry Brigade had arrived at Kuancheng were inaccurate. A major battle is expected in the area within the next day or two. Last night, over three thousand enemy troops once invaded near Nantuanting from Yuhuzhai, but were routed by our troops. For several days, the enemy has been using the mountainous terrain to position artillery on high ground, bombarding our positions with heavy guns. Our troops are lying in trenches, responding calmly. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Beiping and Tianjin were overcast and rainy on the morning of the 20th, with cold weather. It snowed and hailed in the afternoon. There were no battles on the Luan River on the 20th; the two sides remained in a standoff. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan to Return to Command Defense Immediately</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan came to Beiping this afternoon and said that his waist ailment is gradually healing. He is returning to Beiping to briefly reorganize rear affairs and will immediately return to the front to command his troops in resisting the Japanese. The enemy's Pumu 16th Division has arrived in the Kuancheng area and is preparing to actively pressure the defense areas of the North and South Tuan Ting. The battles there are fierce, and he urgently needs to return to the front to command. Xiao Zhenyu has gone to Ganzhou to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. The position of Chairman of the Chahar Province will be temporarily taken over by Xu Yong, so that he can focus on military affairs at the front. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Battles at North and South Tuan Ting are Extremely Fierce</h3>

There were many hand-to-hand combats between the two armies, and the situation was extremely intense. North and South Tuan Ting became contested ground. By evening, the enemy was unable to withstand the attacks and retreated towards Yuhuzhai. Our army still firmly defends North and South Tuan Ting. After nightfall, the enemy intermittently bombarded our positions with heavy artillery, but their infantry did not dare to advance. This morning, six enemy tanks braved the rain to press towards our Sahe Bridge positions but were repelled by our forces. There have been no major battles this morning. With the completion of fortification arrangements on the eastern front, we will concentrate all our main forces to launch a fierce attack on Sahe Bridge and Santunying. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Order in Luan County Gradually Restored</h3>

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Guye states that two enemy armored trains have arrived at Fengtai and one at Anshan, firing shells at our banks of the Luan River from time to time. Yesterday, they also covered a combined infantry and cavalry unit that briefly occupied Shimen Railway Station. Our armored trains covered our cavalry, launching a fierce attack on the enemy and driving them back. Last night, both armies exchanged artillery fire, but there were no fierce battles.

<h3>Rumor That Zhang Jinghui Will Go to Luandong</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that Zhang Jinghui, the puppet Minister of Military Affairs, will arrive in Luandong to inspect and plan the establishment of a North China puppet government.

<h3>Puppet Organization Appoints Zhang Haipeng as Commander of Rehe Defense Forces</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A Changchun dispatch states that the "Manchukuo" government has resolved to appoint Zhang Haipeng as the Commander of the Rehe Defense Forces and concurrently as the Governor of Rehe Province. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Pirates Plot to Complete North China State</h3>
<p>Traitor Li Jichun and Others Hoist Blue-White Flags in Luandong</p>
<p>To Avoid International Criticism and Confuse Our Firing</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese are indeed planning to establish a buffer zone in the five counties of Luandong, led by Li Jichun and Cheng Guorui, and are trying to seduce remnants of warlords in Beiping and Tianjin to organize a North China state, and separately enter into co-existence and co-prosperity conditions with the puppet organization, and advance toward Peiping and Tianjin within a considerable period of time. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Japanese pirates invaded our four northeastern provinces, on the one hand they stated that they had no intention of invading south of the Great Wall, and on the other hand, they used the excuse of expelling the Chinese army from Rehe to cover up international eyes and ears in order to achieve their plot to annex the four provinces of Manchuria and Mongolia and to arrange the establishment of a puppet state. However, in fact, the Japanese army has now forced our army at various passes of the Great Wall to the right bank of the Luan River, and the counties of eastern Luan have already been under their strong control. Fearing that they cannot conceal this from the international community, they ordered the rebellious traitors Li Jichun, Zhang Bi, Cheng Guorui, and other rebellious troops to call themselves the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army in the counties of eastern Luan, falsely using the Blue Sky and White Sun flag, holding the weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will in order to show that their rebellious troops, etc., have broken away from the Japanese side, that the battles in eastern Luan are internal conflicts between the Chinese army and the Chinese army, that the Japanese side cannot be subject to international criticism, and that they can take advantage of this to confuse our side's firing targets in order to achieve their goal of disturbing North China and complete their so-called "North China State" conspiracy. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is no danger of Beiping falling at present. The news reported by the London newspapers is not reliable. Beiping is very peaceful now. Business is as usual. A mild form of martial law has been in effect for more than a month, and there are no signs of tightening it. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Strength of Japanese Troops Stationed in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Approximately 1,700 in Total</p>

The following is based on a reliable investigation: Commander Kotaro Nakamura, Chief of Staff Kikumura, Staff Officer Kawamoto, Infantry Battalion Commander and concurrently Head of the Military Police Morimoto, Translator Yoshida, more than 200 Japanese soldiers stationed at the Haiguang Temple barracks, more than 100 stationed at the Second Company headquarters in Zhangyuan, more than 100 stationed at the First Company headquarters of Mitsui on Shou Street, more than 100 stationed on Akashi Street, more than 100 stationed on Yamaguchi Street and Tanlu Street respectively, more than 20 stationed on Huayuan Street and Fukushima Street respectively, more than 700 military police, more than 300 volunteer corps members, approximately 1,700 in total, including infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers, quartermasters, and signal corps. The force has four heavy artillery pieces, more than twenty small steel guns, and more than one hundred machine guns. The puppet country's office in Tianjin is distributing declarations in the Japanese concession. The wording is extremely absurd. Many traitors and national scum are hiding in the Taihe Hotel and a certain villa in the Japanese concession and have been very active recently. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Penetrate Deep into Chahar Territory</h3>
<p>Battles Occur at Rongling</p>
<p>Situation in Kangbao County is Serious</p>

Sun Dianying immediately submitted a request to the Peiping Military Branch to issue an order to all armies to strictly arrest him.

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Arrived in Peiping Yesterday</h3>

<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Peiping this afternoon. After getting off the train, he immediately went to Jurentang to visit He Yingqin. According to reports, due to the urgent war situation at the front, he came north specifically to help He Yingqin handle everything. The Central Government has always advocated the anti-Japanese plan and will never slacken it. Feng's personal letter has been conveyed to Chiang, who has not yet replied due to official business, but it will be adopted within the possible scope. Chiang still intends to come north, but the time has not yet been determined. He himself plans not to return to Nanjing for the time being. (20th Dispatch)</p>

The members present were the same as those of the Standing Committee, with Wang Zhaoming presiding. The agenda items were the approval of the resignation of Minister of Education Weng Wenhao and the special appointment of Wang Shijie as Minister of Education. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Another source said that Wang Xinggong, the Director of Academic Affairs, will succeed him. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Xu Tingyao Discusses How It is Difficult for the Enemy to Advance Further from Gubeikou</h3>
<p>The Effect of the Enemy's Firing is Minimal</p>
<p>We Respond with Guerrilla Tactics</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Tingyao said that from April 2nd to 15th, the enemy fired approximately 900 shells, killing only one of our soldiers, which shows how minimal their effectiveness is. The enemy originally planned to extend the front line by 20 to 30 li in the direction of Gubeikou to prevent our army from attacking, but because our front-line positions were solid and could not be breached, they only bombarded with artillery daily. We decided to respond with mobile guerrilla tactics to make the enemy uneasy day and night and feel the pain of their actions. If the enemy launches a large-scale invasion, we are determined to cut the enemy into several sections within the mountains using the most active guerrilla tactics and will not let the enemy survive. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Currently, there are approximately three to four thousand enemy troops at Gubeikou, belonging to the Kawahara Brigade of the 16th Division. Kawahara is currently stationed at Gubeikou. The front-line sentries are no more than half a li apart, with the Zhaochao River as the boundary. On the 16th, seven enemy planes bombed Shixia, dropping many bombs. As a result, only a portion of the buildings were destroyed, and there were few deaths or injuries. Our soldiers do not have fixed positions, so the enemy's bombing has no military impact. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Great Threat to Far Eastern Peace</h3>
<p>Completion of the Jihui Railway</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held in Longjing Village</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Longjing Village today, the new railway from Jilin to the Korean border in Dahang has now been completed. The opening ceremony was held in Longjing Village this morning, and many officials from the South Manchurian Railway and the "puppet country" attended. This road is extremely important both militarily and economically, as it can provide an outlet for the resources of the hinterland, transport Japanese goods to the new customs site, and allow Japanese troops to reach northern Manchuria on a new route that is shorter and more stable than the existing routes in the event of another Russo-Japanese war. It is said that the September 18th Incident was also triggered by China's refusal to allow Japan to connect the Jidun Railway with the Korean border. Japan had been planning to connect the two roads for many years for military and commercial reasons. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Current Serious Problems</h3>
<p>Endurance</p>
<p>When Rehe fell, those with superficial views and those who harbored thoughts of temporary peace all believed that the Japanese had already seized the entire four northeastern provinces and that their desires should have been satisfied. It was hoped that they would temporarily halt their steps of aggression, allowing us to obtain a moment of temporary peace. However, before long, Luandong also fell, and the various passes of the Great Wall were broken through. The iron hooves of the violent enemy's aggression had actually entered within the Great Wall, eyeing Peiping-Tianjin and seizing North China, their ambitions endlessly insatiable. This brand-new and ironclad reality should also be enough to shatter the illusions of those who seek only temporary peace. We can assert that under the Japanese imperialists' predetermined continental policy, if our nation cannot rise up and fight, but only sits and waits to be slaughtered, then even seeking to settle for a partial peace will be absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese's consistent strategy of aggression against us has been "relaxation and tightening, with relaxation used to make"</p>
<p>us temporarily forget our suffering. Their tightening is then a case of immediate surgery with no hesitation. From the seizure of Shanhaiguan to the recent occupation of Luandong, all have been examples of this "relaxation and tightening" policy. They have deeply understood the weaknesses of some people in our country, who have only five minutes of enthusiasm, lack lasting perseverance, harbor a psychology of following the beaten track and waiting for temporary peace, are completely scattered, and cannot be commanded as easily as limbs. Moreover, they interfere with each other, so they cannot be handled too hastily, but must be dealt with slowly. Our nation is now under the threat of death, and we do not feel anything. When the pain has not yet subsided, singing begins again. The swallows on the curtain do not know the danger. This is not only lamentable but also painful.</p>
<p>Silently observing the reality presented before us, the symbols of national subjugation are almost all present. The entire country only knows empty talk. When speaking of resisting Japan, they roll up their sleeves and become agitated. When speaking of saving the country, they are excited and慷慨. Everyone has their own opinions and does not work together. In speeches and debates, even if they exhaust all the tragic and激昂 words, they are not enough to show their indignation and enthusiasm. When retreating to private rooms, they sing and dance, feeling calm and at ease. This is the image of the Qing discussion that misled the country in the Jin Dynasty. Generals are arrogant and soldiers are brave, each occupying their own territory, levying heavy taxes to satisfy their private desires. Internally, they are clear about their grievances, but externally, they are absolutely tolerant, and they still send telegrams requesting to fight and sing the customs of sending troops to cover up the ears and eyes of the people. This is also the situation of the separation of feudal towns in the late Tang Dynasty. Politicians and bureaucrats are shameless, discipline is not established, and laws are not implemented. They sell official positions, gather wealth, and indulge in extravagance and debauchery, only seeking personal interests. Honest and capable people are excluded, while malicious people band together to do evil. This is also the image of villains being in power and gentlemen being out of power in the late Ming Dynasty during the Chongzhen era. In addition, the national economy is declining day by day, the people's lives are extremely difficult, disasters occur frequently, and bandits are as numerous as hemp. All the phenomena of turmoil in history are now present. In such a broken situation, and at a time when the capitalist economy is struggling to survive the panic, is there any hope for our country's future?</p>
<p>Should we then sit and wait for the collapse of the country and the destruction of the nation? Is our nation really unsalvageable? This is the urgent question facing us. The times are dangerous and the situation is urgent. The people of the country should make a final plan.</p>
<h3>Constitutional Drafting Committee Decides on Provincial and County Systems</h3>
<p>Provinces Adopt the Governor System with Popular Elections as the Principle</p>
<p>County System Refers to the Provisions in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The eleventh meeting of the Constitutional Drafting Committee on the 20th resolved the following: A. Regarding the principles of the provincial system: 1. Provinces do not need to formulate provincial constitutions. 2. Provinces should adopt the governor system. 3. The principle of popular elections should be adopted for provincial governors, but before all counties in a province have achieved complete self-governance, the central government may temporarily appoint them. 4. Provinces shall establish provincial councils. 5. Provincial governors and provincial councilors shall be elected by provincial people's representative assemblies. 6. The organization of provincial governments, provincial people's representative assemblies, and provincial councils shall be determined by law. 7. Changes in provincial districts must be approved by the Legislative Yuan. B. Regarding the county system: Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings contain detailed provisions that can be used as a reference. In addition to stipulating the outlines of the four rights that the people should directly exercise, no further principles will be drafted. If any committee member has any opinions, they may submit them to the drafter at any time. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The first draft of the constitution is scheduled to begin drafting on May 1. Zhang Zhiben, Wu Jingxiong, Jiao Yitang, Wu Shangying, Ma Yinchu, Chuan Bingchang, Chen Zhaoying, and seven others have been appointed as the main drafters. There are rumors that the location will be Shanghai, but this must be decided by the meeting. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Discusses His Inspection Trip North</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Lifu discussed his inspection trip north, focusing on Party affairs, advancing Party organizations, inspecting past achievements, and correcting errors. He separately convened meetings with committee members of the Party branches of railways in the provinces of Ping, Tianjin, Hebei, Henan, and the Northeast, as well as the cities along the Ping-Sui and Bei-Ning railways. He provided instructions on model work guidelines, formulated implementation measures based on the work plan promulgated by the Central Government, and assigned responsibility for propaganda to Committee Member Shao Yuanchong and for mass movements to Committee Member Wang Luyi. He personally resided in Kaifeng, Baoding, Beiping, and Tianjin for a total of one month, delivering academic lectures and speeches a total of fifty-five times. Regarding his impressions from the inspection, he noted that students had great faith in the Three Principles of the People, but regretted that few explained it using scientific methods. Students were also able to devote their spare time to practical work in the fight against Japan, such as manufacturing gas masks and helmets, rather than merely shouting slogans as before. Although Communist elements were active in various schools, they were not as rampant as in the past. He stated he was unable to comment extensively on military affairs in North China, noting that matters were closely related to geography. Since the loss of Lengkou, the area east of Luan River has been under great pressure from the enemy geographically. When the enemy attacks, they have aerial bombardment from above, tank and artillery fire from the middle, and naval artillery bombardment from below, advancing simultaneously by sea, land, and air in a three-dimensional war, while our side is defending on a flat plane. The disparity is obvious. Our army bravely resists Japan and does not retreat unless absolutely necessary. Most of the rumors circulating outside are fabricated by the Japanese and Chinese traitors, and some are spread by those who rejoice in others' misfortunes to sow discord. However, the general public and the soldiers on the front lines have a clear understanding of the Central Government's attitude and will not be misled by rumors. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

After the court opened, the records were read, and no one made any significant corrections. Then, a final interrogation was conducted, and each person's answers were the same as in the previous hearing. Subsequently, the prosecutor presented his arguments, concluding that Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Wang Ziping, and He Afang were guilty of violating Articles 6 and 2 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, while the remaining defendants were guilty of violating Article 6. However, the prosecutor noted that this case was less serious than the Noulens case and requested the court to take this into consideration when sentencing. Chen Duxiu then presented his defense, arguing that opposing the Kuomintang government was not endangering the Republic of China because the government is not the country. He then stated three reasons for opposing the Kuomintang government and the reasons why advocating for the dictatorship of the proletariat was not endangering the Republic of China, and requested the court to declare him innocent. Zhang Shizhao then made a defense lasting an hour, which was the most noteworthy moment for the entire audience. He explained, based on Chen's words and actions, that Chen had not betrayed the country and requested the court to declare him innocent. Peng Wangye and Wu Zhiping, the two lawyers, then added their opinions. The court adjourned at 2:00 PM and resumed at 4:00 PM. Peng Shuzhi and the other nine defendants then made their defenses, and the lawyers defended them. At 6:30 PM, the debate was declared concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for the 26th.

The bandit areas have been generally pacified, and they are now comforting the refugees and actively organizing transportation and civil defense. However, they are experiencing a shortage of food and resources. Jinjiazhai, Dushan, and Mabou are particularly devastated. Although political efforts are being made for post-disaster reconstruction, the situation is still difficult. Only long-term pacification and production can be effective.

<p>Rumors of Russian Troops Digging Trenches on the Border</p>
<p>Workers on Eastern Section of Railway Go on Strike</p>
<p>Retired Employees Demand Back Pay</p>
<p>(Harbin) Although the railway dispute between "Manchukuo" and Soviet Russia has led to an exchange of diplomatic notes between the "Manchukuo" government and the Soviet Russian General Representative of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Kushniakov, for diplomatic negotiations, the situation remains tense. It is rumored that about a thousand Russian soldiers have dug trenches within Manzhouli and are stationed on the border to prevent incidents. The Russian soldiers are now drilling daily and can be seen in Manzhouli, causing great panic among the residents on the border. It is reported that the Russian soldiers have fourteen pursuit guns and a large number of machine guns. Workers at some stations on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, such as Yimianpo, are currently on strike, reportedly due to Communist propaganda. Traffic has not been severely affected. It is rumored that the Russian General Manager of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Rudy, has moved to the Soviet Russian Consulate, indicating that someone intends to harm him. Currently, both sides are reviewing documents related to the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is reported that the Russian General Representative insists that "Manchukuo" has certain rights to freight cars, but about six hundred have already been returned. As for the locomotives, they belong to Soviet Russia and therefore cannot be returned according to "Manchukuo's" request. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Retired employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway recently held a meeting here and found that about 700 people are living in extreme poverty because the railway authorities have refused to pay their arrears.

The meeting decided to send representatives of the retired employees to demand that the railway authorities pay all the arrears in the first half of the year. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Official circles criticized Soviet Russia's letter regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, stating that Japan is prepared to pay for the transportation of Japanese troops on the Chinese Eastern Railway, but requests that the fees be reduced according to the reduced fees previously charged for transporting Chinese troops on the railway. Japan has already deposited the amount due according to this method into the Chinese Eastern Railway account. As for the locomotives and freight cars detained by Soviet Russia, Soviet Russia should return them because the Chinese Eastern Railway is a joint Russian-Manchu enterprise according to the 1924 treaty. Japan has no intention of buying the Chinese Eastern Railway. Due to the completion of competing routes, its economic value has greatly diminished. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>United States Abandons Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Announces Restoration of Gold Export Embargo</p>
<p>Domestic Prices Already Soaring</p>
<p>Roosevelt Decides to Stop Maintaining Gold Parity</p>
<p>Will Request Congress to Grant Authority to Inflate Currency</p>
<p>Aiming to Use as Powerful Weapon in Future Economic Talks</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 19th "The United States has now abandoned the gold standard." This straightforward statement was made by US Treasury Secretary Woodin at the end of the world's fiercest currency war. This war had lasted for a long time, and at one point, it had caused the value of the US dollar to depreciate to 92 cents against other currencies.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th President Roosevelt declared today that the restoration of the cash export ban is a way to raise domestic prices. Treasury Secretary Woodin, in response to questions, said that the United States has indeed temporarily suspended the gold standard and is not issuing export licenses for gold. Meanwhile, he announced the previously specified regulations for permitted cash exports. Woodin declined to elaborate on the regulations, but said that when they are issued, it will be clear what can be exported and what cannot. It is speculated in some quarters that cash used to settle commercial contracts entered into before this week may still be licensed for export.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th Senator Thomas and government advisors have drafted an amendment to the rural relief bill to grant President Roosevelt greater power to inflate the currency. It is reported that the President has agreed to this amendment. The bill is expected to be submitted to Congress today. In addition to authorizing the President to issue currency at his discretion, it also stipulates that debtor countries may use silver to repay war debts under certain conditions, and that the gold content of the US dollar may be reduced through international agreements or other means.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 20th President Roosevelt's decision to prohibit cash exports, that is, to abandon the gold standard, is due to Congress's urgent desire to raise prices and its intention to pass unrestricted currency inflation policies, even if it is not timely. Under these circumstances, much of the effectiveness of Roosevelt's discussions with British Prime Minister MacDonald and French representative Herriot on economic and monetary issues will be lost, because the conclusions that can be reached in the three-nation talks will be overturned by the US House of Representatives or Senate. Roosevelt believes that the best way to achieve results in the three-nation talks is to let the US dollar rise and fall naturally in the foreign market, but to control it when necessary. It is said that the President's move, if regarded as a threat to countries with low exchange rates, to facilitate economic negotiations, is a misunderstanding. The President's move is specifically to avoid disorderly currency inflation. In short, the purpose of this policy is to enable countries with devalued currencies to conclude an agreement at the end of the economic conference to restore the gold standard.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 19th Since the US Treasury Secretary announced that the United States had officially abandoned the gold standard, from financial leaders to the poorest farmers, everyone has been seized by a frenzy of currency inflation. Tonight, the US government has obtained the full support of the nation's largest banks to begin a currency inflation plan. It is expected that within 48 hours, Congress will transfer its constitutional power to the President, allowing him to inflate the US dollar, reuse silver as currency, devalue the gold dollar, and negotiate with foreign countries to stabilize global exchange rates, and accept no more than 100 million yuan of silver from debtor countries. It is also heard that this revaluation of the gold dollar and reuse of silver as currency will be an important objective of the United States at the World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 19th Official opinion is that the United States abandoned the gold standard when the Treasury Department initially announced that it would no longer maintain the value of the gold dollar with gold exports, allowing it to rise and fall naturally. The US government's decision to stop maintaining the value of the gold dollar is due to President Roosevelt's efforts to raise prices. Although the President has not yet issued a formal statement on the reaffirmation of the gold ban, White House officials have confirmed this, saying that the President wants to raise prices through the passive method of no longer maintaining the value of the gold dollar. Therefore, he specially issued an executive order prohibiting the export of gold, only gold already labeled as foreign-owned and the balance due in trade settlements may be exported in accordance with previous regulations. As a result, prices in the domestic market soared, and stock prices also surged. Silver prices in the metal trade rose the most sharply, reaching the maximum limit allowed by exchange regulations, rising to 300 pounds. Rubber, silk, and grains also experienced similar sharp increases. Only sugar prices were not greatly affected and failed to rise as sharply as other commodities, and sales volumes also decreased significantly. Operators said that they are currently groping for a way forward and it is difficult to make a judgment for the time being. At this time, the opinions of financiers and economic experts are very confused. A group in New York demanded that Woodin immediately announce the Treasury Department's future policy, whether it will actually abandon the maintenance of the gold dollar's value, or only temporarily abandon it. But the only response from the White House was to announce that gold exports would be prohibited until further notice. This situation led officials to admit that the United States had abandoned the gold standard. Currently, rumors about this move are rampant. In New York, it is rumored that the President wants to ban all gold exports, even those listed as exceptions in the executive order, in preparation for currency inflation. However, inquiries to government offices have not been able to confirm this. Congress is quite troubled by the status of the gold dollar in the foreign market. Several congressmen have pointed out that its value may not be stable, and that maintaining it is futile. The general supporters of currency inflation are also meeting urgently. It is rumored that these people have sent a letter to the President, stating that if the White House does not immediately prepare all practical plans, Congress will pass its own inflation plan. However, this cannot be confirmed at present. Only Senator Thomas, who met with the President yesterday, said that he hoped that an important statement would be issued in 24 hours. When the excitement subsided slightly, economic experts and those close to the President said that they expected the President to ask Congress to grant him more discretionary power on monetary issues in order to control the situation. Several congressmen also said that although this is tantamount to Congress abandoning its constitutional right to coin money and regulate its value, many congressmen support abandoning this right in an emergency, so that the President can be given a powerful weapon when discussing economic matters with other countries. A leader of the Democratic Party said that even if Congress grants this power to the President, it is not expected that the President will use it, but only to protect the policies of the United States in future talks. This is its main result. As for opening the path to immediate and large-scale currency inflation, it is not the real purpose.</p>
<h3>Government Drafts Currency Inflation Bill</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 19th The currency inflation bill drafted by US Treasury Secretary Woodin, Secretary of State Hull, and other key figures will include the following four points: 1. The President will independently initiate the revaluation of the gold dollar through the use of silver as currency and other best methods; 2. Negotiate agreements with foreign countries to revalue gold and stabilize currencies; 3. When the President deems it necessary, he may print greenbacks (note name) or other forms of currency; 4. Accept silver from debtor countries at a price not exceeding 50 cents per ounce, not exceeding 100 million yuan. While the US government is busy drafting this new bill, the head of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. also issued a statement in New York, endorsing the President's measures, stating that it is now clear that all efforts to maintain the exchange rate of the US gold dollar, keeping currencies devalued by other countries at a premium, has had a contractionary effect on the currency, resulting in a contraction of US prices and wages, and increasing unemployment. Therefore, I feel that the clear path to escaping economic recession is to overcome this deflationary force, and that the government's current measures are the best path under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Friends of the President said that Roosevelt may not be forced to use all the powers granted by this bill, especially regarding printing greenbacks or currency without fixed gold or silver reserves. The purpose is only to obtain greater power, so that he can conclude favorable agreements with countries such as Britain and France. When asking other countries to raise their currency exchange rates, he can use the possibility of depreciating the US currency and putting it in a competitive position as a bargaining chip. Most White House advisors also said that the saying that this move will give the President a powerful bargaining weapon is not entirely accurate, because in fact this new power will enable the United States to respond to many proposals made by other countries. As for the attitude of Congress towards this bill, according to the joint statement of various leaders, it is expected to be passed.</p>
<h3>Abandoning the Gold Standard Has Four Effects</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th The New York Tribune stated that President Roosevelt's formal abandonment of the gold standard has</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>four effects: 1. To raise domestic prices to suit the world situation; 2. To facilitate the expansion of domestic lending without the need to artificially maintain the price of the US dollar abroad; 3. To improve the position of the United States in dealing with monetary issues with other countries at the Washington pre-meeting of the World Economic Conference; 4. To curb the tendency of uncontrolled inflation plans in Congress. Speakers have different opinions on the US President's policies, but most agree with what the Tribune said. It is expected that the meaning of the US President's policies can be seen in the attachments to the rural relief bill. It is now heard that the plan agreed to by Roosevelt will give the President full power to handle the national currency. It is said that the current gold content of the US dollar is 23.22 grains, and it will be reduced to 16 grains in the future. The amendment proposed by Senator Thomas, which can be submitted to the Senate today, is heard to stipulate that the President has the power to determine currency inflation. Therefore, if appropriate, the President will naturally have the power to reduce the gold content. From the phenomenon, the World Economic Conference may discuss the possibility of revising the current 40% standard of the currency gold ratio. The US authorities are obviously unwilling to agree to Congress's proposal to broadly mint silver coins, or plans similar to those proposed by former Senator Bryan. According to the most reliable sources, the government will have a way to deal with silver, but at the same time, it will strictly limit the use of silver as the basis of the currency.</p>
<h3>Speculative Frenzy, Market Suddenly Active</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 19th When the stock exchange opened today, prices were up one to eleven pounds. At the close, many securities were up one to eight pounds. News that a currency inflation plan was being considered in Washington was met with a feverish frenzy by speculators. The stock-buying activity was unprecedented since September last year. Industrial stocks also rose, and trading was very active. Prudent people said that when Britain suspended cash payments, the price of the pound first soared and then plummeted. The past is a guide for the future, so be careful. But this statement is not enough to suppress the courage of speculators. The restoration of the gold ban made the US dollar hopeless, and foreign exchange rates soared. Government bonds tended to weaken due to the development of inflation, while other securities were lively, especially foreign bonds were firm. Major bankers today expressed great hope for the government's decision to handle the inflation issue. The people of the country expect the government to take decisive action to stop the painful and seemingly endless process of tightening. After the commodity market received the news that the government would adopt an inflationary process, it suddenly became active. The buying of grains was frantic, which was rare in peacetime. The Chicago wheat market initially rose by five cents per bushel, but near the close, many closed out positions, causing the already increased price to fall a lot, but it was still one and seventy-five to two and a half cents higher than yesterday. The cotton market rose by about two dollars per bale. The market price of silver bars also rose to the highest level since November 1931. At the same time, rubber, cowhide, and silk all reached heights not seen in recent years. Speculative buying spread throughout the markets, so the number of transactions was mostly a new record. Spot silver rose by three and a half cents today due to speculators' unbridled buying, which was the largest increase in many years. Silver futures also soared, reaching a maximum of three cents, which is also a rare spectacle since the establishment of the metal exchange. Silver futures later fell due to closing out positions, but soon rose again. All monthly futures were about three cents higher than the previous day. The silver market has this increase because silver will occupy an important part in a practical currency inflation plan.</p>
<h3>British Impose Retaliatory Ban on Russian Goods After Vickers Case Verdict</h3>
<p>New Zealand Will Follow Suit</p>
<p>Russian Exports Greatly Affected</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th According to reliable sources in London, if Britons Thornton and MacDonald are spared imprisonment, then Britain's ban on Russian imports could be lifted. The ban has already been signed and is scheduled to take effect on April 26th. Goods transported to England that are affected account for 80 percent, such as butter, grains, raw cotton, kerosene, and timber.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 19th After the Soviet Russian court sentenced British technicians, the British government retaliated by banning the import of Soviet Russian goods. Some people think that there is no reason, saying that British Conservatives have always opposed the ban on Russian imports. This move must be to satisfy the Conservatives. Otherwise, the British technicians were not severely sentenced, so why take such drastic countermeasures.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 20th It is expected that Soviet Russia will be greatly affected by Britain's ban on Russian imports, because Soviet Russia currently relies solely on the surplus from trade with Britain to meet its debts to other countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, 20th New Zealand Prime Minister Forbes announced today that the government will consider banning the import of Russian goods.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th The amount of raw cotton exported from Russia to Lancashire has increased greatly in recent years. Therefore, the ban on the import of Russian goods will also affect British cotton spinners, brokers, and shippers. An official of a cotton company in Lancashire said today that the company purchases and uses Russian cotton and finds it very satisfactory, declaring it harmonious, but it does not matter if it is not used. A major cotton spinner in Manchester said that Russian cotton is indeed not bad, but he believes that the ban will not greatly affect Lancashire, because American cotton prices are currently very cheap.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 19th According to the British Embassy here, the new British Ambassador to Russia may not arrive in Moscow in February or March. Mrs. Litvinov, the Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner, will hold a reception tonight, inviting diplomatic representatives and journalists from various countries to attend. However, personnel from the British Embassy do not intend to attend.</p>
<h3>All Germany Celebrates Hitler's Birthday Enthusiastically</h3>

<p>Havas, Berlin, 20th Because of the national crisis, Chancellor Hitler does not want to hold celebratory entertainment for his birthday, but all government offices are flying the national flag, and lantern parades are held in the evening.

<h3>Goering's Speech on Economic Problems Before Leaving Rome</h3>
<p>Attended Meeting of National Representatives</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Still Uttered Peace</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 19th - Goering, the Premier of Prussia, Germany, today met with the Queen of Italy and attended the economic conference of national representatives. He addressed the Italian senators as the first international representative to speak. Goering stated that no single country can solve economic problems alone, and Germany is most deeply involved with the current world economic organization. Therefore, Germany is also the most willing to cooperate with its neighbors to actively solve various economic problems. The world should not ignore that it has reached a historical turning point. Today, there is a danger of destroying the entire world, and Italy is the first country to bravely resist this destructive force. Today, representatives of various countries gather here with the aim of harmonious cooperation, and should no longer treat each other as victors or vanquished. Only in this way can international problems be thoroughly resolved. After Goering's speech, the Japanese representative stood up to speak, reiterating that Japan is eager to restore peace in the Far East. Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, its attitude of maintaining peace and cooperating with various powers remains unchanged. As the meeting was about to close, the King of Italy cordially shook hands with Goering before departing. Mussolini also expressed his appreciation to Goering, praising Italy's gratitude. Goering flew to Milan this afternoon to visit the Milan Goods Competition. Havas, Berlin, 20th - Papen returned here this morning from Rome. The Steel Helmet Brigade honor guard greeted him at the station.</p>
<h3>Saito Determined to Cling to Power</h3>
<p>The Satsuma Faction and Saionji Incompatible</p>
<p>Seiyukai and Kokumin Domei Secretly Plot to Overthrow the Cabinet</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - Prime Minister Saito, at the conference of local governors, told the governors that he would not leave during this extraordinary period and that the officials still need to work hard. Today, he also told a certain high official that if Finance Minister Takahashi is determined to resign, the cabinet does not want to resign en masse. The reason for Saito's change of heart is that the military and the Kwantung Army are strongly opposed to the coup, and the upper house factions and senior statesmen are also afraid that the Fascists will seize power and cause internal strife. For the above reasons, Saito has decided to cling to power. However, recently the Seiyukai and Kokumin Domei have secretly plotted to overthrow the cabinet, and the situation is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun reported on the 14th that since Prince Saionji Hachiro of the Imperial Household suddenly resigned, the development of the political situation has become increasingly chaotic. According to observers familiar with the political situation, the meaning of Prince Saionji Hachiro's resignation can be summarized in one sentence: it is the Satsuma faction's challenge to Prince Saionji. Recalling when the Saito cabinet was established, Prince Saionji's question to the Emperor, Count Yamamoto Gonnohyoe actually refused Prince Saionji's invitation. In other words, the Satsuma faction, with Count Yamamoto as its commander, supporting Makino, Saito, Ugaki, Izawa, Yuasa, etc., in order to consolidate their power, revealed traces of opposition to Prince Saionji. Therefore, Prince Saionji Hachiro expressed his intention to retire. According to the current situation, Izawa, Yuasa, etc., who are secretly planning, are only the vanguard of the Satsuma faction, and the actual problem is even more serious. At this time of political change, the Satsuma faction's independent audience with the Emperor will inevitably face opposition. Because the opinions among the Genro have deepened, the future of the political situation may see unexpected turbulence.</p>
<p>It also said that in October last year, a strange document was discovered by a certain party. The document exposed the relationship of the ○○ incident. At that time, General Ugaki of Korea, who wanted to be very active, was fatally hit by this document. Afterwards, he was still extremely dissatisfied with Ugaki, and there were even threatening letters preventing Ugaki from crossing the Korean Strait. Fortunately, he ignored them and bought off the press to ease the situation. The strange document also mentioned Makino, so Makino once revealed his intention to resign. However, the Satsuma faction's intention is that if Makino resigns, they still intend to recommend Prime Minister Saito to succeed him, and the next cabinet is internally decided to be Ugaki. Currently, Izawa of the Satsuma faction is actively moving around and raising funds in Osaka. At the same time, the Minseito, with the Satsuma faction as its background, is trying its best to prevent the transfer of the next cabinet to the Seiyukai. Such a fierce power struggle is all due to the conflict of opinions among the Genro, which has stirred up waves.</p>
<h3>Japanese Immigration Plan for Northeast China</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th - The Ministry of Colonial Affairs is studying the concrete plan for Manchurian immigration.

The general policy of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs regarding Manchurian immigration has been decided as follows: 1. Manchurian immigration is not limited to agriculture and industry, but must also create forestry and gold production projects. 2. The promotion of free immigration will be jointly undertaken by the East Asia Development Company, South Manchuria Railway, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. The expenses will be considered by the South Manchuria Railway, East Asia Development Company, and the government. If necessary, an immigration company will be established with investment from the East Asia Development Company. Currently, the Oriental Development Bank is providing some financing.</p>
<h3>Korean Communist Party Not Fully Arrested</h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Seoul, 20th - The Police Affairs Bureau of the Korean Governor-General's Office announced this morning that since the Korean Communist Party's headquarters were broken up in June 1931, it seemed to have become extinct. However, on January 4 this year, a political prisoner was arrested in Busan, and it was discovered that the Communist Party had long since restored its organization. The Japanese police then ordered all police stations throughout the territory on February 15 to simultaneously break up the newly built Communist Party, arresting 43 key figures, 16 of whom have been handed over to the Seoul District Court. This news was only allowed to be published in newspapers today.</p>
<h3>Four-Power Agreement Plan Italy and France Exchange Views</h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 19th - Various news about the Four-Power Treaty plan has been spreading abroad. Diplomatic circles here have issued a statement saying that discussions are currently being held with the Italian government regarding this treaty plan. The French memorandum on the Four-Power Treaty has indeed been delivered to the German government in an informal manner, which is no different from the British proposal on the Four-Power Treaty that was previously sent to Germany.</p>
<h3>Foreign Female Compatriots Go to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Do Not Let Japanese Women Monopolize the Glory</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Tokyo Correspondence - Since the outbreak of the war in northern China, female students from a certain pharmaceutical school near Osaka Port believe that female students should not only work in the rear, but should also go to the front lines when necessary and serve in the trenches. Therefore, they requested the staff headquarters of the 4th Division of the Army to send military instructors to the school to conduct training. This request from the female students, rather than being regarded as an automatic expression of patriotism, can be said to be the effect of the army authorities conducting orderly propaganda among the female students. In Japanese newspapers and magazines, there are often photos of female students being instructed by soldiers in target practice and marching. The military authorities certainly do not want to rely on women to defend the country. Their intention is probably to make women feel interested in the militarist movement. The advocates of this movement not only want to use militarism on the battlefield, but also want to use it to solve various important social problems in the future.</p>
<h3>War News Obtained in Zunhua</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya.</p>
<p>Talks with Chief of Staff Zhang and Deputy Army Commander Qin</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Zunhua: The 29th Army, which accepted the critical situation of the retreat of the Jehol Army and stubbornly defended Xifengkou in hard fighting, refreshing international views, has its headquarters in Zunhua. Army Commander Song Zheyuan is in Tianjin for medical treatment. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Qin Dechun and the division commanders are commanding on the front lines. The reporter specifically visited Chief of Staff Zhang, whose conversation was as follows: "The national war to protect the country and defend the people is the only excellent opportunity that our soldiers have encountered in 21 years, and it is also the honorable and natural duty that our soldiers hope to fulfill. We are very grateful for the comfort from the people, but we dare not take it for granted. Our army has been fighting hard against Japan for more than a month. The Japanese army took our superior positions first and has new and sharp weapons, so our army's casualties have reached nearly 6,000. However, we do not begrudge it, and no one has ever complained. This is in accordance with the Army Commander's usual training of 'advance without retreat, die without regret.' We deeply feel that if we do not fight to the death, it will not only damage the national character, but also be impossible to face people. Our soldiers have no face to wear military uniforms. Because the government is constrained by the Communist Party, it is difficult to transfer elite troops to continue to support the north for a while. Therefore, our army insists on the determination of the greatest sacrifice. Even if only one soldier is left, we are willing to seek benevolence and obtain benevolence. If it is possible, we must preserve a bit of vitality for the country. It is indeed a pity and painful to consume too much useful flesh and blood. However, at this time when the enemy's flames are spreading and constantly forcing us, if we retreat step by step, how can we bear it? When the violent Japan first occupied the three northeastern provinces, its heart was not only in the three northeastern provinces. Now that it is attacking Chahar and Hebei, its wild ambitions are more than just North China. The country has sown evil causes and evil results due to years of civil war. At this time, we should thoroughly understand and dispel the misunderstanding and unite to face the outside world." Then the reporter told him that the villagers along the way mostly asked about the news of the planes. Zhang replied, "The soldiers on the front line, because of the enemy's fierce bombing, when they cannot withstand the bombing, also think like the old people who are concerned about the war. The other day, the enemy deputy army commander met with Minister He in Beiping, and was sincerely concerned about the fierce bombing by Japanese planes. Our deputy army commander smiled and replied, 'Fortunately, in the war of the 19th year, we had tasted the taste of planes, so we are also calm.' The bombs dropped by the enemy planes are about the height of one person, and the range of the explosion is about 10 meters, and the depth of the soil is 3 meters. The loss of the bombed position is very large. Our army was reorganized into the 11th Division in the 19th year, and reduced to three divisions. Under special circumstances, the remaining officers and soldiers had to find ways to provide them with rations. The resources are limited, and there is no way to economize on the expenses. The army is extremely poor. Each soldier needs one and a half catties of flour per day on weekdays. During the war, the consumption is more than one and a half catties. According to the regulations, we will not be able to afford it. Therefore, in the past 30 days or so, the rations issued to the soldiers have only been slightly more than usual, and not enough for wartime. It is really unavoidable. The failure of Jehol was first and foremost due to the lack of cooperation between the soldiers and the people. We have heard songs everywhere, which is a warning. Our army usually does not harm the people in the slightest. The food and grass supplied by the people in the war zone are recorded in detail, and when the funds arrive, they will be repaid one by one. Fortunately, we have the trust of the people, and they give us assistance, which is enough to encourage our soldiers at the front. We must have today, and we will have the future. We will never repeat the mistake of opening the door to welcome the bandits. We must implement our determination to 'advance without retreat, die without regret.'" Later, the reporter asked about the recent war situation. He said that the deputy army commander would return from the front line at night, and there would be news to tell. Let's make another appointment for a chat. The reporter then resigned.</p>
<p>At 8:00 a.m. today (16th), I went to the army headquarters and met Chief of Staff Zhang. He said that Deputy Army Commander Qin had returned and was going to Beiping. I was immediately invited into a small room for soldiers. Deputy Army Commander Qin then came out to meet me and said that years of civil war have led to economic backwardness and rural bankruptcy, which has given Japanese imperialism the opportunity to intensify its aggression. Recently, its wild ambitions have become even more blatant. Our army had long anticipated today's serious national crisis, so we have always taken protecting the country and defending the people and thoroughly resisting imperialism as military training. Knowing yourself and knowing your enemy, you can win a hundred battles. The enemy has new and sharp weapons, which are certainly advantageous for daytime warfare and long-range warfare. Although our weapons are not as good as theirs, we can use night warfare and close warfare, that is, at night, we can surprise the enemy and wield a large sword to chop off the enemy's heads. The war situation last month has been detailed in various newspapers. From the 9th of this month to today, the positions have been repeatedly gained and lost, and the enemy and we have suddenly advanced and retreated, all engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The 12th day and the first half of the 13th day were the most intense. Our officers and soldiers suffered 500 to 600 casualties. Yesterday, the enemy army waded across the Sa River and occupied two small villages on our right flank, one named Nantuanting and the other named Beituanting. We wounded one battalion commander, killed two company commanders, and wounded and killed more than 100 soldiers. However, at night, the two villages were taken back by our army's desperate efforts. In this nearly 40-day war of resistance against Japan, the lessons learned are: 1. Scientific inventions, of course, flesh and blood cannot resist guns and bullets, but if the people of the country are rich in patriotism and sacrifice, and if they can add sufficient material, it would be even better. Otherwise, the spirit may not be able to overcome matter. 2. It is important to use our strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses. The enemy's strengths must be prevented from being brought into play, and our weaknesses must be properly protected. 3. Dispatching reinforcements must be flexible and fast, especially for marching on foot in inconvenient transportation. 4. The division lies in harmony. The entire army is under a single commander, regardless of boundaries. The divisions should be like family fathers and sons, responding to each other's attacks, and striving towards a common goal. 5. This is an international war, also known as modern three-dimensional warfare. The entire nation, soldiers and civilians, should be mobilized in unison. The army is an effective force for the people, and the people are a strong support for the army. Most of our army's achievements come from the help and encouragement of the people. The wounded soldiers abandoned on the battlefield are often risked by the villagers to carry them back. When there are traces of the enemy, they will report them. The Zunhua militia firmly requested to participate in the work on the front lines, which is a glimpse. Other material and spiritual assistance given by the people in various places is beyond description. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, about 5,000 soldiers have died. The usual ratio of war casualties is 7 to 3, but now, because the weapons are not as good as others, the casualty rate is 6 to 4, and there is a danger of exceeding it," and so on. Later, the reporter firmly requested to go to the front line for inspection. He introduced Division Commanders Zhang Zizhong, Liu Ruming, and Shen Kesan, and their wives who fought with the army, and made brief talks. They all agreed to go to the front line for inspection tonight. The reporter and a total of seven people stood in the courtyard, laughing and talking to each other, as if forgetting the hardships of the battlefield. They took a photo and dispersed. Today, at 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., I faintly heard the rumble of artillery fire. The residents all went to the dug-out openings to listen to prevent planes, but it has not yet been confirmed where the artillery fire came from. (16th)</p>
<h3>Jin Sui Army Stands Ready in Chahar</h3>

<p>Zhangyuan Correspondence: Since the Jin Sui Army's Li Fuying's Department was ordered to set off to resist Japan, it has expanded to (blank spaces in original). Li Lei was promoted to (blank space in original). After the reorganization in March last year, it was greatly rectified and painstakingly trained. Military discipline and etiquette were extremely strict. All officers and soldiers were extremely indignant at the violent Japan's invasion of us.

Therefore, they strengthened the construction of defenses even more meticulously. Corps Commander Fu and (blank spaces in original) and others must lead the staff to inspect the defense line every day, instructing them on the strategy. Moreover, each army is strictly disciplined and loves the people. Recently, many refugees have been (blank spaces in original).

This kind of cooperation between the army and the people can invisibly increase the strength of resistance against Japan.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou National Salvation Association Implements Joint Responsibility System</h3>
<p>Merchants of All Guilds Must Not Promote Enemy Goods</p>
<p>Three People Form a Group to Supervise and Report Each Other</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the reorganization of the Automatic National Salvation Association in this city, it has been extremely enthusiastic about boycotting enemy goods. In addition to sealing up all old inferior goods from various guilds and not allowing them to be sold, it also telegraphed the merchants in Hong Kong and Shanghai that if they send goods to Fujian in the future, they must obtain a certificate from the original manufacturer for inspection. If any false or counterfeit goods are discovered, the merchant should be responsible. Therefore, inferior goods have gradually disappeared from the market in Fuzhou recently, and imports have also greatly decreased. However, the Automatic National Salvation Association is still afraid that unscrupulous merchants may secretly transport and sell them, undermining the overall situation, so it has implemented a joint responsibility system (with three households forming a group) to supervise and report each other to eliminate malpractices. The full text of the 21 articles of the joint responsibility system is copied below:</p>
<p>Article 1: This association aims to fully express the spirit of the people's automatic national salvation and to take effective actions for national salvation by implementing a joint guarantee system.

Article 9: Business entities that accept the constraints of this System shall be linked together in groups of three shops and shall be jointly responsible for supervision and mutual reporting. Article 10: In the same group, if one shop or one person violates the covenant, the other two shops or two persons shall be responsible for reporting and shall have the obligation to report. Article 11: When the person responsible for reporting discovers that a related person in the same group has violated the covenant, he shall report to this association in writing or orally. Article 12: If a related person in the same group has committed an act of violating the covenant, and the person responsible for reporting knows about it but does not report it, he shall be deemed an accomplice and shall be subject to an appropriate punishment. Article 13: Business employees who accept the constraints of this System have the obligation to report the violation of the covenant by the business entity of their respective shops.

Article 19: When those who are bound by this Joint Responsibility System are reported to have violated the covenant, the execution committee shall execute it after the judgment of the arbitration committee of this association.

<h3>Yu Guocai's Troops Returned to Guizhou from Yunnan</h3>
<p>After Several Mediations by Long Yun and Others</p>
<p>Wang Jialie Allotted Defense Areas to Yu</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: After Wang Jialie returned to Guiyang in Guizhou Province, Yu Guocai went to Beijing to seek assistance, and then went to Yunnan Province to ask Yunnan Province Chairman Long Yun to send troops to help restore the situation in Guizhou, willing to cede ten counties as a reward. Long and Yu were originally on the same front, and he was quite willing, but Long was also afraid of being dissatisfied by Guangdong and Guangxi, so he changed his plan to become a mediator for Yu and Wang, instructing Yu to gather about 5,000 remnants of Wei and Wu on the border of Yunnan Province, and the military rations were temporarily supplied by Yunnan Province to maintain the status quo. On the one hand, he telegraphed Wang Jialie, asking him to give Yu's troops appropriate arrangements to avoid other changes. At that time, Wang Jialie had not yet resolved the situation of Che Mingyi's troops in the east, and Hou Zhidan's troops in the north were also in close contact with Mao Guangxiang, so he had many concerns. However, on the surface, he still refused to show weakness and refused to accept Long Yun's proposition. Therefore, Yu Guocai became very angry and immediately appointed Wu Jianping as the commander of the advance troops, and he himself took office as the commander-in-chief, leading 5,000 troops to attack Xingyi, Anlong and other counties. Wang then sent Li Chengzhang's brigade and He Zhizhong's division to meet the enemy, and the two sides came into contact near Xingyi. At the same time, the anti-Wang atmosphere in Guizhou Province took the opportunity to become strong. Wang Jialie felt that the environment was not good. The actual strength of his troops was only about 10,000, scattered throughout Guizhou, which was not enough. There was no ability to start a war. He had no choice but to send Mao Yueqiu to Kunming to meet Long Yun, asking him to convey to Yu Guocai to stop military actions and discuss peaceful solutions together. Long Yun immediately responded to his request, and the tense Guizhou war was eased. Yu Guocai also went to Luoping to discuss everything with He Zhizhong. As a result of the peace talks, Wang Jialie welcomed Yu Guocai back to Guizhou and allotted three counties, including Xingyi and Anlong, for Yu's troops to temporarily garrison, and allocated 50,000 yuan per month in military salaries to support Yu's troops. A scene of turmoil finally subsided. However, Yu believed that with 5,000 troops and the territory of three counties, it was difficult to distribute them, so he telegraphed Wang Jialie again, stating that the return of his troops to Guizhou was a temporary garrison. Once there was a suitable opportunity, he would lead his troops north to resist Japan and requested that the eight counties of Panjiang be allotted to him as well. Initially, Wang Jialie did not agree, believing that allotting the eight counties of Panjiang to Yu's army, together with the three counties of Xingyi and others, would total eleven counties. The defense area would be wide, and in the future, Yu's troops would become powerful and would inevitably raise troops to force him to resign. After Mao Yueqiu, Lu Shouchi, Long Yun, and others tried their best to mediate, Wang finally agreed. The allotment has now been officially made, and Yu's troops have also entered and garrisoned separately. (April 18)</p>
<h3>Two Hes Decide on Bandit Suppression Plan for Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>He Chengjun Goes to Jiangxi to Meet Chiang Kai-shek for Instructions</p>
<p>He Jian Appointed Bandit Suppression Commissioner for the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border Region</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, recently attended the Seven Provinces Security Conference in Nanchang. Having completed his duties, he flew to Hankou on the 18th from Xunyang. He Chengjun, Pacification Commissioner of Hubei, met with He Jian on the 18th and 19th upon He Jian's invitation, to jointly discuss the bandit suppression plan for Hunan and Hubei provinces. Xu Yuanquan, Commander of the Tenth Army, also participated in the discussions. Arrangements and coordination between the armies of the two provinces were decided, along with a resolution to eliminate regional boundaries and act uniformly. After the plan is finalized, the two Hes will instruct their respective troops to strictly follow it. At 9 p.m. on the 19th, He Chengjun took the Jiangshun steamer to Xunyang, then to Nanchang to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. He Jian left Hankou on the 20th by the Wuchang-Changsha railway to return to Hunan. It is said that during He's meeting with Chiang in Jiangxi, Chiang appointed He as the Bandit Suppression Commissioner for the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border region, assigning part of the bandit suppression task in Jiangxi Province to He's responsibility. Thirty-seven counties west of the Gan River, including Yangxin and Daye in southern Hubei, are within the scope of the Hunan army's suppression efforts. He has already drafted a plan for clearing and suppressing the remaining bandits in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border region, which he will submit to Chairman Chiang for approval. (April 19)</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Zheng Yuxiu Case:</p>
<p>Investigating Cha Laisheng</p>
<p>Request to Disqualify Judges Rejected</p>
<p>Zheng Yuxiu, the former president of the Shanghai District Court, was impeached by the Supervisory Yuan for dereliction of duty and embezzlement. The case was transferred to the Jiangning District Court by the Jiangsu High Court for investigation and prosecution. Currently, Cha Laisheng has submitted a request to the Jiangsu High Procuratorate to disqualify the judge presiding over the case. Wang Simo, the chief procurator of the High Procuratorate, rejected the request, stating that only parties involved in the case are entitled to request disqualification, as clearly stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. Furthermore, since the case has already been prosecuted, there is no basis for disqualification. Therefore, yesterday (the 20th), a notice was issued rejecting Cha Laisheng's request as being contrary to the law.</p>
<p>Jiang Hong's Second Appeal Case Concluded</p>
<p>Jiang Hong, director of the Jiangyin County Relief Institute, was accused by Ji Sha of Jiangyin County of defrauding her of five thousand yuan on suspicion of her son Ji Renhua being a counter-revolutionary. The Jiangyin County Government sentenced Jiang to a fine of two hundred yuan. Jiang filed a second appeal, which upheld the original verdict. He then filed a third appeal, which was referred to the Wuxian District Court for retrial. The court held a hearing at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 20th). Jiang hired lawyers Zhang Yipeng and Tang Ying for his defense, while Ji Sha hired lawyer Zhang Shiying. Jiang claimed that the five thousand yuan was not obtained through fraud, but given by Ji Sha to ease tensions. Three thousand yuan was used to purchase firearms for the Public Security Bureau, and two thousand yuan was a charitable donation to the Relief Institute. Ji Sha claimed that the county government did not receive the three thousand yuan, and Jiang pocketed the two thousand yuan. After the lawyers' arguments, the court scheduled sentencing for the 26th.</p>
<p>Changshu District Chief Accused of Dereliction of Duty</p>
<p>Citizens Xu Biruo and others of Changshu County submitted a petition to the Administrative Inspectorate of the Third District of Jiangsu on the 20th, accusing Wu Yu, the chief of the Seventh District of Changshu County, of embezzling public funds and neglecting his duties.

<p>Factory Girl Commits Suicide After Being Raped</p>
<p>The Yongfu Quarry Company in Tianmashan has many workers. The daughter of Qiao Guozhen, a stone crushing machine operator, was raped by Mao Rubiao, the captain of a stone transport boat. Overcome with shame, she committed suicide. Mao fled after the incident. The girl's father went to the branch police station in the town to seek justice, stating that his daughter, Xiao Mengzi, was raped by Mao, and seen by his son, who told his wife. Upon returning, they loudly berated her, and the girl committed suicide out of shame and indignation. After the patrol officer conducted an investigation, the case was reported to the headquarters and transferred to the Procuratorate. Yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Zhu led officials to the village for an on-site examination.</p>

<p>Police Beat Merchants, Causing Town-Wide Strike</p>
<p>Deng, the owner of the Hengfeng Dried Goods Store on South Street in Qingshi Town, was walking on East Street at approximately 7 p.m. on the 18th when Jiangbei native Zhi Fang, a street cleaner from the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, splashed mud on Deng's clothes. The two men had a verbal altercation. Nearby patrol officer Fang Guisheng, Zhi Fang's son, helped his father beat Deng. This angered the public, who protested that the police were beating merchants, and immediately went on strike. Over three thousand people gathered at the district office to petition. Bian Shang, the district militia commander, failed to mediate. Merchants of the town sent representatives to the county seat on the 19th to appeal to County Magistrate Ruan, demanding that the offending patrol officer be severely punished and the bureau chief and patrol officer be disciplined before they would resume business.</p>

<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Order to Eliminate Production of Poison Pills in Five Counties</p>
<p>Cai Pei, the Administrative Inspector of the Second District of Wuyi, yesterday ordered the county magistrates of Wujin, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Yixing, and Liyang to eliminate the production and sale of poison pills within a limited time. The original text stated that the counties had not been very effective in investigating and arresting red pill dealers, resulting in ongoing sales and private production, which was poisoning society and harming the nation. The county magistrates should strictly order public security agencies to thoroughly investigate and arrest offenders. Private production in remote areas of the county is particularly prone to being tipped off and fleeing to neighboring areas. The whereabouts should be investigated and secretly reported to this office for coordinated arrest efforts on a scheduled basis. Complete elimination is required within a limited time.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Zhentao Bandits Dispersed</p>
<p>Bandits gathered at Zhentao, on the border of Nantong and Rugao counties, burning, looting, and kidnapping, causing severe disturbances. The Provincial Security Department dispatched provincial and county police forces to jointly suppress them. The bandits have been dispersed, and the countryside is being cleared to search for hidden bandits. The riverfront area is being patrolled by river police to prevent fleeing bandits from escaping by boat from the beach.</p>
<p>Warden Detained for Misappropriation of Funds</p>
<p>Yu Peisheng, the warden of the Fourth Prison, misappropriated over three thousand yuan in public funds. After investigation by the Nantong County Court, Yu requested to repay the funds in installments. The court submitted the request to the High Court for approval, which ordered a lump-sum payment. Yu was unable to raise the funds and is currently detained in the detention center.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Commissioner's Office Expenses Temporarily Allocated by Province</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Administrative Inspector's Office in Jiangsu Province, annual expenses of over 200,000 yuan are required. It is learned that the Finance Department is having difficulty raising these funds due to the emptiness of the provincial treasury. Initially, it was proposed that each district raise its own funds. After repeated discussions at the recent provincial government meeting, it was decided that the expenses for April, May, June and March would be disbursed from provincial funds first, and the districts would find other ways to raise funds later.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Petition to Levy Additional Land Tax</p>
<p>The local budget for the 22nd year in this region passed the two levels of local administration, totaling 598,115.84 yuan in expenditure, with a shortfall of 53,397.18 yuan compared to the total revenue. Now, County Magistrate Ma has submitted a petition to the Provincial Finance Department to levy an additional land tax of four fen per mu (9.68 jiao per tael for "Ding" land and 4.84 jiao per tael for "Za" land), as was done in the 20th year. This is estimated to generate an annual revenue of 50,999.83 yuan, reducing the deficit to only 2,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Security Team Rescues Kidnapped Child</p>
<p>One Kidnapper Killed</p>
<p>Ling Xichun's son Jicheng, eleven years old, a resident of Tuanwu near Xialiqiao in Shaoxing, was kidnapped by bandits who sent a letter demanding ransom. The family sent representatives to Shanghai to negotiate, but the bandits' exorbitant demands could not be agreed upon. The security bureau's secret agents in Shanghai arrested bandit Chen Shuifa, who confessed to the location of the kidnapped child. The agents escorted the bandit to Hangzhou, and the security team dispatched four members, along with the bandit, to rush to the bandits' stronghold on Shi Jiayu Mountain in Shaoxing for a rescue attempt. The bandits spotted them and immediately opened fire. The agents returned fire, killing Wang Tianbao, the bandit guarding the captive. The remaining four or five bandits fled. The kidnapped child, Ling Jicheng, was safely rescued from the thatched shed. The body of the slain bandit was transported to Hangzhou. Yesterday (the 20th), the court was notified to conduct an examination and provide a coffin. The child remains in custody pending the arrival of his family to claim him.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Road Construction Workers Escorted Out of the Province</p>
<p>The Yinci Town Automobile Company contracted the construction of the section of road from Yin County to Camel Bridge in Ci Dong to Zhang Yongji, a foreman from Yin County. However, due to the poor quality of the construction, Wang Youmei, the manager of the company, terminated the contract and hired another foreman. Zhang Yongji, dissatisfied, gathered over one hundred and ten workers armed with shovels and other tools on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and rushed to Camel Bridge to confront the new construction workers. The new construction workers, numbering over one hundred and thirty to one hundred and forty, also used construction tools as weapons and engaged in a brawl. The new construction workers were defeated and retreated, with five or six people injured. Zhang Yongji's workers then occupied the road. Upon hearing the news, Wang Youmei, the manager of the company, urgently telegraphed the Cixi County Government for assistance. Lu Siyi, the director of the Public Security Bureau of the county, and Wu Pinfu, the captain of the task force, led a team of police officers to the scene for armed mediation. The director and others, along with the police team, escorted all the workers involved in the incident to Yong in six cars yesterday morning, and then, in conjunction with the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, sent them to Shanghai under escort.</p>

<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Issues Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Opposing Concessions Seizing Factory Inspection</p>
<p>But Still Willing to Negotiate with Concession Authorities</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Regarding the passage by Western taxpayers in the Public Concession the other day of amendments to the Yangjingbang Regulations, Annex, to seize factory inspection rights, Mayor Wu issued the following statement:</p>
<p>I have stated that factory inspection, regarding our country's entire labor administration and the enforcement of factory law in the concession, should belong to Chinese government agencies. There is absolutely no reason to object to this claim by the Chinese government, whether based on political principles, legal principles, or the powers of the Municipal Council itself. However, the Municipal Council continues its practice of exploiting amendments to the Yangjingbang Regulations or adding annexes to wantonly expand its powers, a practice that anyone familiar with the history of concession development cannot but regret. Yesterday, when Chairman Bell of the Municipal Council read the motion, he did say that the reason why the Municipal Council could not inspect factories was due to historical reasons. I firmly believe that if Chairman Bell considered the entire history of concession development, his views would certainly change. In July 1862, when the Shanghai Daotai wanted to levy taxes on Chinese people in the concession, the British consul objected, but British Minister Bruce instructed the British consul, "The treaty does not allow us to interfere in this matter. The Daotai should have the right to levy taxes on Chinese, which are already paid by residents both inside and outside the city beyond the concession. We have no reason to object." He also said, "If we do not allow the Chinese government to govern the Chinese people in the concession, then we cannot rely on Article 18 of the treaty for protection from the government and people of that country." The British Minister's opinion was supported by the British government. Therefore, the following year, British Foreign Secretary Russell informed the British Minister, "The land of the British concession undoubtedly belongs to China. The fact that Chinese people live in the concession does not exempt them from their obligations to that country." At that time, some foreigners in Shanghai were still unaware of this, so the British Minister instructed the British consul, "The Chinese government has never formally given up its right to govern the Chinese people, and the British government has never requested or clearly expressed any desire to obtain the right to protect the Chinese people. Please do not forget these two matters. The British government is unwilling to maintain a system that cannot stand on principle." The British Minister's attitude was supported by all countries. American Minister Balingen instructed American Consul Seward, "Foreigners often infringe on the rights of Chinese people when managing municipal affairs. Therefore, foreigners must be awakened to return to the safe zone of principle. I cannot agree to any method that disregards China's rights, that is, the rights that a sovereign state should have over its land and people." In summary, the legal status of the concession is very clear. Even historically, the limitations on the powers of the Municipal Council are self-evident. We must not forget our origins. The Municipal Council knows full well that even according to the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, which were painstakingly and meticulously developed by its predecessors, the Municipal Council has no right to manage factory affairs. It also knows that any attempt to amend the regulations for this purpose will not be agreed to by the Chinese government. Therefore, it seeks to use a trick, based on Article 11 of the regulations, to convene a special meeting of Western taxpayers to amend the annex, hoping that after the motion is passed, it will be approved by more than half of the consuls and ministers of the treaty countries, and thus be effective without the consent of the Chinese government. This is clearly feigning ignorance. The same article of the regulations stipulates that any additions, alterations, or terminations must not conflict with the regulations. According to the Yangjingbang Regulations, the so-called fundamental law of the concession, its powers are limited to the following: first, to establish a public bureau; second, to construct and maintain various necessary projects within the concession; third, to properly manage and clean the entire concession, establish street lights, store water to sprinkle the ground to prevent dust, and open ditches; fourth, to establish street patrols and police (this was added later; initially, only watchmen could be established); fifth, to prepare public land and buildings required by the public bureau, either by renting or buying; sixth, to raise funds for the officials and staff required by the public bureau. Therefore, Article 9 of the Municipal Council Regulations, which states that "the concession area must be prepared for governance to ensure its proper management," lists the matters that are permitted to be governed, and is not a comprehensive list. According to the established rules of legal interpretation, the difference between a listed method and a comprehensive method is that the former is limited to the items listed, while the latter can be analogized. The purpose of adding annexes is only to achieve "the various items of the regulations can be made more perfect," but cannot go beyond the scope of the items listed in the regulations. Otherwise, it would conflict with the provision in Article 11 of the regulations that "it cannot be contrary to the regulations," and would be invalid. Therefore, the motion passed yesterday by the Western taxpayers' meeting regarding factory inspection cannot obtain a legal basis according to the Yangjingbang Regulations. I deeply regret the Municipal Council's adoption of this attitude. However, the Chinese government will never give up its right to the entire labor administration, let alone the concession authorities' attempt to seize our country's labor administration rights, which has no legal basis. Its position and the passing of the annex are no different from before. However, factory management is a matter of urgency that cannot be delayed. I am still willing to sincerely negotiate with the concession authorities to find a solution that does not infringe on Chinese sovereignty and at the same time benefits all the city's workers and promotes harmonious labor-management relations.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Cables Arrival in Poland</h3>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Troops Return Home in Batches</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan, the Northeast anti-Japanese general who retreated into the Soviet Union, cabled various parties in Beijing and Shanghai yesterday, reporting that he and 66 other senior generals, such as Su Bingwen, Li Du, and Wang Delin, arrived in Moscow on the 18th. Yan Huiqing, our country's ambassador to Russia, personally welcomed them at the station, providing food and expressing deep gratitude. After a short rest, they left Moscow and set off to return home, arriving safely in Poland on the 19th. They are expected to arrive in Germany on the 22nd. Whether they will transfer through France or take a ship back home from Germany will be decided after arriving in Germany. However, their hearts are set on returning home as soon as possible, to go to the front lines again to kill the enemy and save the country. Over 10,000 troops who retreated into Russia were disarmed in Russia and then departed in batches to return to Xinjiang, our country. The first batch of over 2,000 people has already arrived in Xinjiang Province, the second batch of over 3,000 people is currently en route, and the third batch of 5,000 people has also begun to depart. It is expected that they will all arrive in Xinjiang within a month.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, April 20: General Ma Zhanshan and his party of sixty people arrived here today. Most of the men are dressed in Western suits, but the women and children are still dressed in Chinese attire, so when the train arrived at the Penkof station, everyone scrambled to see them, regarding it as a spectacle. Ma Zhanshan and others are currently refusing to disclose the details of the battle. They will stay here briefly before returning home.</p>
<h3>US Abolition of Gold Standard Does Not Affect This City</h3>
<p>National News Agency reports: Yesterday, the United States abolished the gold standard and simultaneously reinstated the gold embargo to prevent an extreme outflow of gold, causing a great change in the gold industry in this city. The gold exchange fell sharply from the morning, with the standard gold price, which had previously broken the 1,000 yuan mark, falling below 1,000 yuan. The market was chaotic, with a difference of over sixty taels between the morning and afternoon. The reporter specially inquired about the details from a financial giant in the financial sector, as follows:</p>
<p>US Abolishes Gold Standard</p>
<p>It was said that the US suddenly abolished the gold standard, which it has always used, and it is impossible to predict future changes. However, the reason for its abolition is certainly no more than insufficient reserves due to high production. There are also relations in auxiliary currency. The US use gold coins, like our use silver dollar. If we only used silver dollars and had no bronze coins and small silver coins as supplements, circulation would be inconvenient. The situation in the US's abolishing the gold standard is certainly not that simple. In short, it can be said that there is no harm to China, and even some benefit.</p>
<p>Beneficial to China</p>
<p>As for the claim that it is beneficial, it is because after the US abolishes the gold standard, it will use silver. In this way, the price of gold will fall and the price of silver will rise. China has always used silver, and its annual imports exceed its exports. Now, using the same amount of silver, we can buy more goods, which is beneficial. Exporters must clearly lose, but in recent years, the customs records show that imports exceed exports in almost every month. Simultaneously Implemented Gold Embargo</p>
<p>The US's abandonment of the gold standard and simultaneous restoration of the gold embargo is also a matter of course. The US is afraid that after gold is converted to silver, it will be useless for a while and will flow out too much, which is not beneficial to the US. Therefore, it must be exported. China is currently valued in silver dollars, but it is still under a gold embargo. Increasing Purchasing Power</p>
<p>The original intention of the US's abandonment of the gold standard, in my observation, is that domestic production is congested, and the supply of all goods exceeds demand. The people are limited by their high standard of living, especially with the implementation of the gold standard. On the one hand, the people cannot afford it, and on the other hand, finance becomes stagnant. Merchants cannot sell their goods and deposit them all in banks. The banks turn cash into dead goods, finance is not smooth, and so on. Therefore, this measure is taken. After its implementation, not only will finance circulate, but the people will be able to reduce their expenses and slightly increase their purchasing power.</p>
<p>Shanghai Occupies a Position</p>
<p>The world's economic market is led by London in England, followed by New York in the United States. However, the US has repeatedly thought about absorbing the London market, seeing that England's policies and methods of concentrating commercial goods are excellent, but the US ultimately failed. But Shanghai once occupied the third position in the world economic market because goods can be sold in Shanghai. In the past, no matter what country's goods or what kind of goods, as long as they are slightly cheaper after arriving in Shanghai, there will definitely be buyers. Therefore, foreigners call Shanghai a dumping market. Now that the US has abandoned the gold standard, it can be said that it has no effect on the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>New Chairman of the Municipal Council Takes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Actively Proceeding with Amendments to Land Regulations</p>
<p>The special meeting of Western taxpayers convened by the Municipal Council to discuss amendments to Clause 34 of the annex to the Land Regulations was passed at the meeting the day before yesterday. The newly elected chairman of the board also took office yesterday. It is reported that the new board of directors will discuss the motion to submit it to the diplomatic corps for approval at next week's meeting, so that the Municipal Council can actively manage factories. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>New Chairman Takes Office</p>
<p>The directors of the Municipal Council for 1933-34 held their first meeting at noon on April 20 to elect the chairman and vice-chairman of the board. Mr. Arnold proposed and Mr. Yuan Ludeng seconded the motion to elect Mr. A.D. Bell as chairman. The motion was unanimously approved by the directors. Mr. Bell immediately took the chair and thanked the directors for their kindness in electing him as chairman. Then, the chairman</p>

<p>proposed and Mr. Okamoto seconded the motion to elect Mr. H.E. Arnbold to continue serving as vice-chairman. The motion was also unanimously approved. Mr. Arnold immediately stood up to thank the directors. The meeting then adjourned. Mr. Bell served as chairman of the previous board and has served as a director every year since 1925. He also served as vice-chairman in 1927 and 1928. Mr. Arnold was the vice-chairman of the previous board and served as chairman in 1929.</p>
<p>Proceeding with Resolutions</p>
<p>Amendments to Clause 34 of the annex to the Yangjingbang Regulations, which is the motion to undermine our country's labor administration and seize our country's factory inspection rights, has been passed by the special meeting of Western taxpayers. However, according to Clause 11 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, the motion must still be approved by a majority of the consular corps or the ministers of various countries. Therefore, the Municipal Council must complete this procedure. It is reported that the Municipal Council is determined to implement this plan and will disregard our country's opposition. It will discuss the procedure to submit the motion to the diplomatic corps for approval at its first board meeting next Wednesday, hoping to actively manage the factories within the concession.</p>
<p>Assigning Committees</p>
<p>The assignment of Municipal Council members to various positions is usually done by the board of directors. The members of the current Municipal Council have been elected for some time, but since the board of directors only took office yesterday, the positions have not been assigned. It is reported that the board of directors will discuss this matter at next week's meeting and assign the positions to the members.</p>
<h3>Air Force Defending Air Force</h3>
<p>Airplanes are Better Than Anti-Aircraft Guns</p>
<p>Aviation Association Decides to Purchase First</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Wojang's Conversation</p>
<p>During the fourth report on aviation solicitation achievements, Wu Tiecheng, the solicitation team leader and mayor, proposed ordering twelve airplanes to form a squadron and go north to resist the enemy. However, the general opinion of the public is that it is better to deploy more anti-aircraft guns to defend against enemy planes, because the number of Chinese and Japanese air force planes is too far apart, and increasing one or two squadrons will probably not benefit the military much. A reporter from the New Voice News visited Mr. Lin Wojang, secretary-general of the Aviation Association, yesterday morning to inquire about the progress of ordering airplanes and whether air defense is beneficial. According to Mr. Lin, the association plans to purchase eighteen airplanes first, forming two squadrons. After the results of the Shanghai solicitation, the funds will be paid to order the airplanes, because the situation in North China is becoming increasingly dangerous, so there is a proposal to order the airplanes earlier. All directors expressed their agreement. The order will be placed after approval at next week's regular meeting. It has not yet been specifically decided which country and factory to order from. Foreign aviation and military experts believe that the effectiveness of airplanes is better than anti-aircraft guns for air defense. Because anti-aircraft guns are fixed in position, they can only be effective if enemy planes fly within their range. However, airplanes have a very high speed, and the opportunity to hit them is very small. Therefore, the most effective method is still to defend the air force with the air force.</p>
<h3>Various Circles' National Salvation Through Aviation Movement</h3>
<p>Citizens of the Second Special District Donate</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the Citizens' Association of the Second Special District of Shanghai is actively organizing a fund-raising committee to collect funds for a "Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Aircraft." The third fund-raising meeting of the association decided to start publicity today (the 21st) and begin soliciting donations tomorrow (the 22nd). All publicity slogans were distributed to the district branches yesterday and were required to be posted by the end of the day. Districts 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 were designated to post the slogans at the entrances of shops and in alleys within their respective districts, while districts 2, 3, 4, and 5 were to post the slogans only in the alleys; the Boy Scouts of the association will be responsible for posting them at shop entrances. The fund-raising method has also been decided: the Boy Scouts from the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Regiments will form donation teams, each consisting of three members, totaling one hundred and fifty teams. Donation tickets are divided into three colors: red for one-yuan tickets, yellow for six-jiao tickets, and green for two-jiao tickets. The donation standards are as follows: individuals can donate freely, each household should donate at least six jiao, and each shop should donate at least one yuan. Those who make special donations will receive corresponding rewards, it is said.</p>
<p>Tram Workers Contribute Large Sums</p>
<p>All ticket inspectors, drivers, and ticket sellers from the Shanghai Tram Company's old and new factories in the Public Concession are known for their enthusiasm towards national affairs. Since the launch of the National Salvation Through Aviation campaign, the workers from both factories have been donating. The first batch of donations amounted to 897 yuan, which was delivered yesterday to Wu Kaixian, the captain of the 57th team of the China Aviation Association's Shanghai Solicitation Team. It is reported that certain individuals disrupted and opposed the donation drive, which somewhat affected the results.</p>
<h3>Two Foreign Aviators to Visit China</h3>
<p>Vaino Brener</p>
<p>The famous Finnish aviator, Captain Vaino Brener, plans to make a round-the-world flight. He departed from Finland on the 12th of this month, passing through Persia and India to China.

The aircraft is a Junkers, with an Aims ProngSiddeleg 80-horsepower engine, identified as Ohacc. It carries a rifle camera and 200 bullets for emergency landings. The Finnish Legation in China has formally notified our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which in turn notified the Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Yesterday, it also informed the Shanghai Municipal Government, allowing the aircraft to land and be inspected upon arrival, provided that it does not use the camera to take pictures within the territory during landing.</p>
<p>John Higgins</p>
<p>British Air Marshal John Higgins and his wife will visit China, arriving in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month aboard the Empress of Japan.

<p>Company Announcement</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the Shanghai Telephone Company in the Shanghai Concession issued a notice to the cross-boundary road users yesterday after signing a telephone contract with the Chinese municipal authorities for building roads beyond the boundaries. The notice stated that there would be many changes in the installation procedures and telephone rates. The contents are recorded as follows: "Regarding the telephone issue outside the two concessions, our company has obtained the consent of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession and the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession, and has signed a contract with the Municipal Public Works Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications today (i.e., the day before yesterday). This contract is temporary in nature, and either party may cancel it by notifying the other party three months in advance. However, during the validity period of this temporary contract, both parties should still negotiate a permanent solution." 1. For those who installed telephones in the area beyond the western district road before January 1, 1932, an additional one yuan and four jiao per line per quarter must be paid as a royalty for the Shanghai Municipality's concession. This fee will be calculated from the next quarter's telephone bill and collected together. 2.

<h3>Shanghai Japanese Cotton Mills Implement Work Reduction</h3>
<p>Average Reduction of 20% in Each Factory</p>
<p>Now Decided to Reduce to 40%</p>

<h3>Women's Association Reports on the Northern Comfort Trip</h3>
<p>Describing the Bravery of the Soldiers at the Front</p>
<p>Lamenting the Lack of a Comprehensive Government Plan</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Northeast Compatriots held a meeting of all initiators at its association on Fuxing Road on the 19th. Ms. Shen Huilian, Wang Xiaoying, and Wei Ying reported on their recent northern comfort trip, mainly stating that the purpose of their northern trip was to inspect the real war situation at the front, comfort the soldiers, wounded soldiers, and refugees, and to inspire the public and awaken compatriots to rise together and become the government's backing. Because its meaning was significant, they did not hesitate to endure hardships, travel long distances, not fearing enemy shells, not missing the elderly and young at home, and resolutely went north, departing on March 29 and arriving in Ping on April 3. They immediately visited Minister He and various agencies and organizations to discuss comfort procedures. The next day, they went to Xifengkou and met General Song Zheyuan, expressing their condolences and sending condolence funds. Then, they visited the battlefield, seeing that the defensive works were very solid, and the heroic spirit of the soldiers overflowed from their eyebrows. Everyone was determined to die for the country. The morale was high, which was admirable. They also saw the trophies such as Tangke vehicles, machine guns, steel helmets, military uniforms, and military flags. The enemy's new-era military fire was conquered by our old-era broadswords, which shows that the determination of morale is far better than sharp weapons. After sending condolence funds to the various fronts, they went to the rear hospitals to comfort the wounded soldiers and personally distributed condolence funds in front of the hospital beds. For the injured officers, they also sent flowers and fruits to comfort their spirits. All the injured officers and soldiers were thinking about the war situation at the front, and while moaning, they hoped that the wounds would heal quickly so that they could go to the front line to kill the enemy again. The seriously wounded had fractured limbs and rotting muscles, moaning intermittently. They felt sad and indignant about it. Therefore, compatriots who live in the rear should work hard to help these brave soldiers who are fighting for the country. It is estimated that in addition to the twelve rear hospitals in Beiping City, there are also hospitals in Tongzhou, Jixian, Zunhua, Kangzhuang, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang. They visited them in batches. They also visited the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Return Group and sent a donation of 1,000 yuan. Minister He also visited and mentioned that since coming to Ping, he had set up supply stations, opened rear hospitals, built roads, and set up electric wires and telephones to facilitate military affairs. He also introduced them to visit the defensive works in the city, and they realized that the authorities were determined to resist. The total amount of condolence funds and goods was more than 27,000 yuan. They regretted that the various armies at the front lacked so much materials that they did not have enough money to help them. They deeply hoped that all circles would make efforts to help the soldiers fighting at the front. In short, the impressions after their northern comfort trip were that there were several points worth noting: 1. The morale of the various armies was very high, and they were all able to die for the country; 2. The supply of materials to the various armies was extremely lacking, and transportation was even more difficult; 3. Most of the people in northern China were superstitious and did not believe that the Japanese would invade Beiping and Tianjin. Therefore, when they were in Ping, they saw the masses coming and going in the spring sunshine, as if they had forgotten that the Japanese invaders were about to swallow them up; 4. They did not have a comprehensive plan, and they were afraid that the land would be lost piece by piece and never return.</p>
<h3>The Self-Awareness of Nanjing Road Shops</h3>
<p>Those Who Do Not Sell Inferior Goods Are Even More Determined</p>
<p>Those Who Mistakenly Sold Inferior Goods Repent</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association, in order to encourage patriotism and promote the businessmen's fulfillment of their national salvation duties, have been actively inspecting the shops on Nanjing Road in the areas under the two associations for days to prevent the revival of inferior goods. The general situation has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that after the two associations officially announced the survey results in the newspapers on April 18, all the shops on the road unanimously strived to improve. Those who had already cleaned up and received the proof of merit card became even more determined. Those who had been cleaned up but were still under investigation by the two associations asked the associations to issue the proof of merit card as soon as possible to show their honesty and guarantee. In addition, the manager of the Tongchengcang Foreign Goods Store personally went to the association to explain that the inclusion of a small number of inferior goods in the past was not intentional, and made a written statement that all inferior goods had been cleaned up, requesting the association to send personnel to investigate again and grant the certificate, etc. The Xiexinxiang Store, which has already taken over the store of the Chinese shop, also sent a letter to the association stating that it had sealed up a small number of inferior goods that had been taken over and requested the association to send a commissioner to seal them up. The association, considering that the shops were brave in doing good, which shows that the national salvation work is still feasible, specially sent personnel to inspect again yesterday, and they were indeed cleaned up. The association immediately sealed them up, totaling 107 sections sealed up by Tongchengcang, divided into five display windows, and 43 sections sealed up by the Chinese store, divided into five packages. For Tongchengcang Store, the association agreed to issue a proof of merit card due to its membership relationship (the association does not provide proof to non-members for the time being), and it is also listed as one of the stores that do not sell inferior goods. It is also heard that the two associations will withdraw the proof of merit card if they find inferior goods in the stores that have already received the proof of merit card in the future.</p>

The whole scene applauded thunderously to celebrate the success. Finally, Chairman Chen Yiting gave the closing speech, briefly stating that the association is a group of national domestic goods factories and citizens from all walks of life in the city to promote domestic goods. In the domestic goods year under the economic panic and serious national crisis, it will step up production and sales cooperation, give full play to its national salvation instinct, and hold the second membership solicitation conference. Thanks to Mayor Wu and Principal Pan for their enthusiasm for domestic goods, leading the progress, the captains enthusiastically solicited members and supported the domestic goods movement. Today, they have also taken the time to attend the general unveiling and participate in the competition, which is especially admirable. In the bleak spring cold of rain and wind, more than two times the results have been achieved, which is indeed unexpected. The enthusiastic love of various factories and citizens from all walks of life is a very good impression for the future of domestic goods, and the national economy and people's livelihood are deeply beneficial. On behalf of the association, I would like to raise a glass to thank the captains for their efforts and wish the captains good health, and hope that you comrades will not hesitate to guide and assist in the progress, etc. Photographs were taken and the meeting dispersed.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Imposition of Import Duties on Foreign Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>Levy Taxes on Foreign Goods</p>
<p>To Save Rural Bankruptcy</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries, requesting the imposition of import duties on foreign rice and wheat to save the rural economy from bankruptcy. The original text reads: "Submitting a request based on the situation. On the 19th of this month, the Miscellaneous Grain Traders Guild stated in a letter: 'Our country has vast lands and abundant resources, and the grain produced is sufficient for self-sufficiency, so there is no need for foreign rice. Unfortunately, after the ravages of war, we have suffered severe floods, resulting in a continuous influx of foreign rice and wheat flour, with countless amounts of money flowing out of the country. Fortunately, last year's bumper harvest in the provinces along the Yangtze River allowed farmers and merchants to recover. Unexpectedly, due to global overproduction, rice, wheat, and flour have been rushing into our country, engaging in price-dumping competition without end, causing grain prices to plummet and farmers and merchants to suffer. Taking rice as an example, the farmers’ yield is insufficient to cover their expenses. Guild merchants transport goods from producing areas to Shanghai, but all suffer losses. Rice from Hunan and Jiangxi relies on purchases from Fujian to barely maintain a sales channel. However, supply exceeds demand, making it difficult to reverse the declining trend. Taking the current value in this city into account, top-grade machine-polished rice from Hunan and Jiangxi costs no more than 8.23 yuan per stone when transported from the origin to Shanghai. Various external expenses such as bags, water transport, and packaging require an additional 2.00 to 2.50 yuan per stone. Therefore, the selling price at the origin is only about 6 yuan. Converting rice from paddy rice to machine-polished rice results in about half of the paddy lost as bran and husks. Therefore, the farmers only receive 2.45 yuan for each stone of paddy. Low grain prices are harming farmers to the extreme. It is found that Guangdong and Guangxi are rice-deficient areas, with an annual shortage of about 10 million stones. In terms of supply, the surplus rice from Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang last year is sufficient to meet the demand. However, a detailed examination of rice purchases and sales in Guangdong and Guangxi reveals that only Wuhu ships a small amount, with foreign rice seizing the rest. Currently, the stock of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai is quite large, and the market price is as cheap as mentioned above. Moreover, the value of foreign rice is decreasing, and it is frequently heard that orders are still being placed in secret. If this continues, the disastrous decline in grain prices will be endless. As for wheat, domestically produced wheat will be available in two months. Even if flour mills need to order foreign wheat, it should be limited to meet the needs for two months. However, the reality is not so. Various types of foreign wheat from Australia, Canada, and Argentina are being eagerly ordered from abroad due to their low prices, and merchants are dumping their goods in the domestic market as much as possible. When domestic wheat is harvested, both farmers and merchants will suffer losses. Summing up the various points, it concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Shandong provincial government has already passed a resolution to ban the import of foreign wheat flour and has submitted a request to the central government for implementation. With external troubles and internal worries, rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy, and commercial transportation is on the verge of extinction. If import duties on foreign rice and wheat flour are not urgently imposed, allowing them to flood the market, then our country will not only perish from foreign aggression, but also from the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Therefore, we specially submit this request and appeal to be forwarded to the central government, ordering the Ministry of Finance to earnestly implement it in order to maintain agricultural production and alleviate the people's suffering. It is a great benefit.' The guild also stated that last year, the provinces in the Yangtze River basin all reported bumper harvests. Taking Hunan rice as an example, the provincial government proposed to transport and sell it directly to Guangdong Province. However, due to transportation costs, it was not as cost-effective as foreign rice, so it was discontinued. Jiangxi and Hunan provinces have not developed industry and mining, and have suffered heavily from banditry, greatly damaging their vitality. They rely entirely on the circulation of agricultural products for turnover. Therefore, the low-priced invasion of foreign rice requires taxation to provide some degree of control. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have always relied on spring harvests to supplement autumn harvests. Last year's autumn harvest saw a sharp drop in rice prices, greatly impacting farmers. The silk industry has also been stagnant due to the sluggish sales of factory silk and low cocoon prices, with no sign of recovery. If wheat prices plummet again due to the dumping of foreign wheat, the livelihoods of farmers will be cut off, inevitably leading to them abandoning their fields. The weak will become starving corpses, and the cunning will take risks, which is a great danger to the heartland of the country. The guild's request to impose separate taxes is essential to save rural areas from bankruptcy. If this year’s harvest proves unstable, after the tax regulations are formulated, in the event of a poor harvest, when foreign rice and wheat are needed to supplement the supply, it is possible to temporarily exempt or reduce taxes within a specified period. This is a common practice in various countries and does not hinder the regulation of food supply. It is reasonable to submit this request to the Ministry for review and approval for implementation, as it is in the public interest."</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Approves the Imposition of Land Value Tax in This City</h3>
<p>Submit to the Municipal Government Meeting for Amended Draft Measures</p>
<p>According to Guomin News, the imposition of land value tax in this city has been planned and carried out by the preparatory committee organized by the Land and Finance Bureaus. The collection measures were submitted to the Municipal Government for forwarding to the Executive Yuan for review, with the intention of implementing them on July 1st of this year. It is now known that the Executive Yuan has approved the plan and sent it to Shanghai, including five proposed measures. However, due to three points that are quite inconvenient for implementation, the Land Bureau specially sent Yang Xiaotang, the head of the Second Section, to the Municipal Government yesterday to discuss the matter. It was decided that the measures proposed by the Executive Yuan would be submitted to the Municipal Government meeting this week for amendments. As for the scope of collection, it has been decided to implement it throughout the city, including the concessions.</p>

<h3>Assistance for Suspension of Business</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all member tradesmen of the industry throughout the city discussed various methods of assisting fellow tradesmen in the French Concession who were forced to suspend business during the inaugural meeting. The first issue was whether to accept or reject the mediation of the French Concession Taxpayers' Association. It was resolved to accept the well-intentioned mediation on the one hand and continue the struggle on the other. As for how to proceed with the struggle, it was resolved: 1. To request the issuance of a declaration of assistance in the name of the inaugural meeting. 2. To request that all tradesmen in the city suspend business for three days to express sympathy. 3. To request that all tradesmen in the city hold a motorcade parade with banners reading "Assist French Concession Tradesmen in Suspending Business and Resisting Illegal Taxes" when necessary. 4.

<h3>Nanyang Tobacco Factory Engineering Chief Li Hui Embezzles Bonus Money</h3>
<p>Keeping the Bonus Money Without Distributing It</p>
<p>Over 130,000 Yuan Swallowed</p>
<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's factory was once shut down due to poor business. After reorganization in the spring of 1931, work was resumed. In July of that year, the company's general manager convened a meeting with key factory personnel, including the chief and deputy foremen, the chief engineer, and the heads of various departments, and decided to switch to a contract labor system. A standard of 5,000 cases of cigarettes per month was set, with a production cost of 10 yuan per case. If the expenditure was insufficient, the company would still bear the burden. If there was a surplus, it would be used as a bonus for the workers, to be distributed equally among them. This system was purely intended to increase production and encourage workers. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective, with monthly surpluses in production costs. Therefore, Chief Engineer Li Hui was elected to be responsible for safekeeping and distributing the money on a regular basis. By the end of the year, after only a few months, each worker received a bonus equal to 72 days' wages. However, last year's overall production was even greater than in the past, but the bonus was not paid at all. Therefore, in mid-December of the lunar calendar, most of the workers inquired with their respective department heads and requested payment. The department heads then inquired with Li Hui, who said that the company had not paid the money. The workers then sent letters to the company's general manager, Jian Yujie, questioning him. Jian then convened a meeting and decided to hire accountant Xu Yongzuo to thoroughly audit the accounts. Unexpectedly, while Xu was auditing, Li Hui, knowing that there were untruths and omissions in the accounts, feared that once everything was found out, it would be unfavorable to him. He then colluded with a portion of the workers, including Zhang Desheng, and opposed the audit, claiming that the company should not interfere with the workers' accounts, and forcibly demanded the return of the account books. However, Jian had already taken photographs of the account books beforehand to keep as evidence. Although some of the negatives were also taken away, many still existed, as well as Xu's audit report, so it is still possible to understand the production quantity last year. From January to December, a total of 98,730 cases of cigarettes and 34,650 cigarettes were produced. The actual production cost paid out for the entire year was 771,486.16 yuan, averaging 7.81 yuan per case. According to the fixed quota of 10 yuan per case, there should be a surplus of 215,743.31 yuan, all of which was paid to Li Hui for safekeeping. However, Li only paid out worker bonuses twice in January of this year, totaling 73,486.10 yuan, leaving over 142,000 yuan still in storage. Recently, 10,000 yuan was donated to the Volunteer Army from this money. The actual stored amount of over 130,000 yuan is all in Li's hands. Currently, workers Feng Jialu, Wang Yuanding, Wang Ajin, Ying Jinbao, Wang Jincai, Zhang Bingkun, Wei Jinhua, Xin Rongda, Cai Guiqing, Kong Wanli, Wang Xuexiao, and others have repeatedly approached Li Hui, wanting to know the details of Li Hui's safekeeping and why the money was not immediately distributed, but all were unsuccessful. Therefore, they hired lawyer He Xianzhang to file a criminal lawsuit against Li Hui for embezzlement in the First Special District Court, stating that the defendant, as the person in charge of the bonus money, had such vague accounts, and dared to forcibly take away the account books and obstruct the audit afterwards, intending to embezzle the money. The plaintiffs' hard-earned money has been swallowed up, which is difficult to bear. They requested that the defendant be ordered to hand over the account books, verify the information, and be punished according to the law, and to order the payment of the remaining bonus money for fair distribution, to punish corruption and show justice. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special District Court opened the court for trial. The defendant Li Hui avoided appearing in court. The plaintiffs all came to court with their lawyers and requested that since the defendant was avoiding appearing, a warrant should be issued so that the plaintiffs could apprehend him, so that their hard-earned money would not be lost. The Nanyang Company will also send its legal advisor, lawyer Wu Linkun, to court to listen to the trial. Judge Wu approved the plaintiffs' request and ordered that the case be adjourned to April 29 for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Apprentice's Assault Case</h3>
<p>Xie Moude Found to Have a Mental Disorder</p>
<p>Declared Not Guilty Yesterday</p>
<p>Xie Moude, a native of Nanjing, 19 years old, works as an apprentice at the Dongfang Trust Company at No. 323 Fujian Road. He is usually very amiable and helpful to others, and is quite diligent in his work, so his colleagues treat him with respect. However, at 2:00 AM on the 3rd of last month, while people were fast asleep, Xie suddenly took a kitchen knife and continuously injured four colleagues, Wang Ruixiu, Wang Wencheng, Gu Xuetong, and Xia Fengfei, before fleeing. After investigation by the police, Xie was apprehended at the Dahua Hotel. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court in accordance with Article 248 of the Criminal Code. Xie also hired a lawyer to defend him, claiming that Xie had a mental disorder. After the court sent Xie to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination, the results showed that Xie did have a mental disorder. After the conclusion of the debate, yesterday morning, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, Feng Shide, ascended to the Criminal Division One and declared Xie Moude not guilty. If the police do not appeal, his uncle, Qin Zhongying (the current county magistrate of Xiuning County), will take him back to be responsible for his medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers in Child Kidnapping Case Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>The home of Hu Henian, a Shaoxing native and runner for the World Bank at No. 493 Wayside Road, was broken into by bandits in the late hours of February 24th of this year. Valuables worth over 40 yuan were stolen, and as they fled, they kidnapped Hu's two-year-old son, Guoan, and demanded a large ransom. Subsequently, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate, along with Inspectors Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Shao Jingfan, and others, arrested the kidnappers Wang Weisheng, Zhang Songyao, Sun Zhiming, Zhu Zhonggeng (also known as Genglong), Liu Qin, Yu Jisheng, and the women Jin Xiaomei, Wu Zhou, Wu Yuchun, and Ma Afeng, totaling ten people. A Mauser pistol and 212 bullets were seized, and Hu Guoan was rescued in Macan Village, Ningbo. Sadly, he died of illness within six days, which is regrettable. The First Special District Court, which accepted the case, has concluded its interrogation. Yesterday afternoon, presiding judge of the Criminal Division, Qian Hongye, opened the court to announce the verdict. The police prosecutor, lawyer Ru Baoyi, was also present to await instructions. Qian then announced that Zhu Zhonggeng and Yu Jisheng were sentenced to death, Wang Weisheng was sentenced to life imprisonment, Liu Qin and Ma Afeng were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment each, Zhang Songyao was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, and Sun Zhiming, Jin Xiaomei, Wu Zhou, and Wu Yuchun were all found not guilty. The Mauser pistol and 212 bullets were confiscated.</p>

The soda water stamp tax that should be levied should be continued. In addition to separate letters of instruction, this order is issued to the sub-bureau chief to comply with, immediately prepare the money order, follow the established case, and encourage all merchants to implement the affixing of stamps in order to increase tax revenue, and report on the compliance situation without delay." It is heard that the bureau has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for forwarding to the soda water factories for compliance.</p>

<h3>The Municipal General Labor Union Advocates for Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>French Police Arbitrarily Take Photos and Impose Fines</p>
<p>Requesting the Taxpayers' Association to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union sent a letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, according to the representatives of rickshaw pullers, Zhang Asi, Wang Deda, Jin Are, Zhu Lusi, and others, the French police have been dispatching officers every night to take photos of permits regardless of whether the rickshaw pullers are at fault, and a fine of 50 cents is required the next day to retrieve the permit. Our rickshaw pullers earn only a few cents for running around every day. If they are unexpectedly fined, their livelihood for the day is not guaranteed. Now, the French Concession constables disregard humanitarianism and arbitrarily impose fines, causing unbearable harm to the workers. Therefore, we find it after investigation, everyone knows the suffering of rickshaw pullers, and they are all ignorant people. Even if there is a slight fault, they should be treated leniently due to their ignorance. However, the French police now take photos and impose fines regardless of whether there is a violation, which is very inappropriate if true. Therefore, we specially request your association to seriously negotiate with the French authorities to immediately stop the illegal photography in order to maintain humanitarianism and sympathize with the hardships of the workers. Sincerely, this is for the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association."</p>

<h3>The Health Bureau Advances the Date of Vaccination</h3>
<p>Sends letters to the Education and Social Bureaus for assistance</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau sent letters to the Education and Social Bureaus stating: "We are writing to inform you that cholera is known to be a serious disease, and the results of our bureau's preventive vaccination have been proven to be effective over the years. As summer is approaching, our bureau has prepared for this prevention plan and intends to start implementation from May 1st. All teachers and students in the city's schools (factory employees and workers) will be vaccinated before the summer vacation (in advance). In addition to the vaccination dates being scheduled by our bureau and directly notified to each school (factory), we are concerned that the schools (factories) may not understand the principle and be unwilling to accept it. Therefore, we are writing to request your bureau to instruct all schools (factories) to accept cholera preventive vaccination to jointly maintain health. We are sending this letter accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and handle it appropriately, and extend our public friendship."</p>
<h3>Sanitary Conditions in the Public Concession in March</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Health Officer's report for March stated: "The death rate for foreigners this month was 15.45, compared to 14.21 last month. The death rate for Chinese was 13.06, compared to 16.99 last month. The total number of Chinese deaths reported was 1,149, 340 less than last month. This is probably because fewer abandoned corpses were found.</p>
<p>The birth statistics show that 60 reports were received for foreigners and 104 for Chinese, as well as 37 births of non-residents. The collection of these statistics is now being improved.</p>
<p>This month, 41,296 people were vaccinated against smallpox, mostly through mobile vaccination units, and mostly through health sub-bureaus. The total number is four times higher than in February, due to many vaccinations being given during the Flower Birthday. Furthermore, the effect of posting slogans in various places and publicizing in vegetable markets and other public places has been quite effective.</p>
<p>Among foreigners, the most common infectious diseases were scarlet fever and tuberculosis. Among Chinese, they were cerebrospinal meningitis, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever. Smallpox was also reported slightly, and the rest were less common. The momentum of scarlet fever has also decreased. The actual number of influenza cases is probably higher than reported, as influenza often leads to pneumonia, and pneumonia is quite common.</p>
<p>Cerebrospinal meningitis has increased significantly among Chinese (but foreigners have not been affected). This increase is late in the season and is unlikely to develop significantly. However, this disease seems to have taken root in Shanghai. Once it enters a crowded area, death from this disease is inevitable. The only solution is to wait for the expansion of the city, with more open space, roads, and parks to reduce population density and change living conditions. As for preventive medicine in the current state, it is not easy to quickly eradicate the disease.</p>
<p>The pathological research laboratory tested 1,469 cases this month. Sixty-one people sought treatment for rabies, including five from other places. Forty-three of them were ordered to undergo treatment.</p>
<p>Due to several warm days this month, mosquitoes appeared early. Oiling work in various places began immediately. There have also been many public reports of wind patients. 3,300 wind patients have been caught in the central and northern districts. Several smaller houses in various places were ordered to be whitewashed, and several were prosecuted. In one area, there were 900 inspections and 400 warnings were issued."</p>
<h3>The Chinese Ratepayers Association Sends a Letter to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Requests that the maintenance of public health should not harm the legitimate rights of citizens</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "According to Mr. Feng Guochang's letter, he recently received a letter from the Chief of the Health Department of the Municipal Council on April 3rd, stating, 'It has been found that the Chinese restaurant at 698 Avenue Edward VII has unsanitary conditions, such as 1. Dirty and dilapidated floors, walls, and ceilings, 2. Unclean and damaged refrigerators, 3. Using natural ice, 4. Insufficient fuel storage space, 5. Unauthorized construction in the back, 6. Accumulated garbage. You should inform your shopkeeper in detail and ask them to clean up the areas pointed out by this bureau. If you want to know the details, please inquire at the medical officer's office between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM every day.' After receiving the letter, our office immediately followed it on the 13th and commissioned Mr. Shao Yijian to go to the bureau to meet the Chief of the Health Department in order to appeal in person. At that time, a secretary met on his behalf. After inquiring about the situation, he wrote a note and asked to contact the garbage officer. After seeing the note, the garbage officer introduced him to another Westerner, who commissioned a Chinese Mr. Wang to inquire about the process. Our office stated our intention and defended each point. However, Mr. Wang said that there was nothing difficult to do in these points, and after following the instructions, one could go to the Health Sub-Bureau at the corner of Guangxi Road, Sima Road, to request a re-examination and it would be over. Because there was no responsible person in charge, we could not accept the defense and wasted time, so we left. According to the first, second, and sixth points in the bureau's letter, our office repairs and cleans them regularly, and even if the bureau does not come to inspect, we always pay attention to handling them, so there is no need to discuss these points. Regarding the third point about using natural ice, Article 16 of the bureau's food license states, 'Any cooked or raw food should not be in contact with natural ice.' The items stored in the refrigerator are all uncooked, which is consistent with the license. Moreover, the principle of using ice is to prevent food from spoiling. The bureau should ask whether the principle is the same, so why distinguish between natural ice and artificial ice? Regarding the fourth point, the fuel storage space is insufficient. Our office purchases fuel every day, so no matter what, the storage space should be sufficient. Regarding the fifth point, there is unauthorized construction in the back. Our office only put up a shed in the patio to block the wind and rain, which should not be unsanitary. If it is said that it is unauthorized, there are countless unauthorized buildings in this city. How can the Health Department inspect and order them to be demolished one by one? In short, our office respects the bureau's regulations and does not offer any unspoken rules, which has caused resentment, so it is deliberately trying to add to our guilt. In this time of economic hardship, maintaining operations is already insufficient. If we want to destroy it again, the future hidden worries are unbearable to imagine. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget is short by 1.5 million this year, so it intends to increase the municipal general tax. If the Municipal Council's budget is insufficient, it is natural to think of increasing it on the citizens. However, can we merchants say that expenses are insufficient and increase the selling price? It should be known that no one cares about reducing the actual price. Your association is the mouthpiece of the taxpayers in this city. Therefore, we have reported the details one by one and ask you to inform the bureau so that the bureau does not stand on the position of the Municipal Council of material civilization to face the citizens, but should love the citizens with the intention of understanding the merchants' difficulties. Otherwise, in fact, due to social and economic relations, the citizens are unlikely to satisfy the bureau.' After investigating the matter, we believe that attaching importance to public health is a necessary action in municipal administration. However, if it exceeds the scope of possible implementation, or is close to being demanding, or even has the reason for the attacks in the letter, and is overly critical, it should be stopped to prevent harming the legitimate rights of citizens while maintaining public health. Based on the above, we are sending this letter to your bureau, hoping that you will give it serious consideration. This is addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Jiangsu Province Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Tobacco and Alcohol Industry in Wuxi Details its Suffering</p>
<p>The tobacco and alcohol industries in various counties of Jiangsu Province, in view of the increasing fees and taxes over the years that have become unbearable, have been contacting each other and organizing a provincial tobacco and alcohol industry association to work together, unite, and seek liberation. Since the nine trade associations in the city, including the tobacco exchange industry, have been responsible for preparations, it has been a little over ten days and they have already received letters and telegrams of support from trade associations in various counties. Many have joined, and the situation has been reported in previous newspapers. Now, according to a letter from the two industries in Wuxi detailing the suffering of fees and taxes, it is specially recorded as follows. The Tobacco Exchange and Cigarette Trade Associations wrote: "In reply, we have respectfully noted the contents of your letter. It is found that the government regards this tax as a profit. Over the years, the ratio has increased, and merchants have not been spared. Since the 19th year of the Republic of China, the competent authorities have repeatedly called for the relief of merchants, but in reality, every time the general and sub-bureaus change, the tobacco and alcohol merchants increase their burden once, and the changes become more and more severe, squeezing the marrow, making the tobacco and alcohol merchants suffer the pain of being unable to survive. Your association sees the crux of the problem and has launched a provincial tobacco and alcohol merchant association in order to unite and work together to seek legitimate ways to reduce the burden on merchants. This is indeed an essential plan. Our associations followed the instructions and convened a joint meeting. Everyone believed that the matter was closely related to their own interests and dared not hesitate. It has been decided to reply to your association to express our sympathy and ask you to convene a general meeting as soon as possible. We are sending this letter accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and handle it appropriately." The Liquor, Medicine, and Store Trade Association wrote: "The tobacco and alcohol industry has suffered from the frequent increases in tax rates over the years, resulting in sluggish business. Our local industry has felt unbearable pain. In recent years, it has been difficult for merchants in both industries to maintain their operations. Therefore, many have stopped their businesses. If we do not work together to remedy the situation and relieve the pain, the burden will inevitably become heavier in the future. Now, we have read in the newspaper that your association has launched preparations to organize the Jiangsu Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association and has sent letters to the tobacco and alcohol trade associations in various counties to solicit opinions. After investigating, the annual tax collection period for this year is approaching. Our local industry is planning to discuss remedial measures. We have learned of your association's proposal and express our deep approval. Since you have taken the lead, our association should humbly follow in your footsteps. Please take charge of everything and actively proceed, and we hope that you will give us instructions at any time so that we can follow them. This is our sincere prayer. We are sending this letter specifically, hoping that you will investigate and handle it appropriately."</p>
<h3>Recognition for Inspector Shen's Retirement</h3>
<p>Shen Defu, Detective Inspector of the French Concession Police Department, has served in the French Municipal Council for 33 years. He is diligent and has been praised by his superiors. From 1907 to 1912, most of the important assassination and theft cases in the French Concession were solved by Mr. Shen. He has received the First Class Baoguang Medal from the government (1920), a medal from the Governor-General of Annam (1924), and a gold medal from the French Municipal Council (1927). Over the years, he has been relied upon by the French Concession authorities. Now, Mr. Shen is approaching seventy years old and his physical strength is not sufficient. He has applied for retirement to recuperate. The French Consul-General in Shanghai believes that Mr. Shen has served the Labor Bureau for 30 years as if it were one day and has achieved remarkable results. Now that he is old and retiring, it is not enough to encourage him without giving him special recognition. He has been generously awarded a bonus and a certificate as a permanent memento.</p>
<h3>Business and Academic Circles Pay Attention to the Iron Exhibition</h3>

It is said that business people who attend the exhibition must purchase the association's publications on railway transportation regulations. The association has sold more than 5,000 copies of this publication. The academic community often copies the association's statistical charts and graphs, which shows that the business and academic communities in Shanghai are paying attention to the Iron Exhibition.</p>
<h3>New Detention Center at the Zhanghuabang Customs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Customs and River Affairs Department recently built a detention center next to the Chinese office in the Zhanghuabang Customs. The construction has been completed. It is said that in the future, anyone found smuggling prohibited items on ships, or any shipowner who stops and throws goods on the road in violation of the route, will be detained. Because the original personnel in the Zhanghuabang Customs are insufficient to dispatch, a Westerner and several Chinese staff members have been transferred from the Shanghai Customs Yangshupu River Patrol Boat to Songjiang to serve. It is expected that it will be implemented on May 1st.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Women's Incense Burning Group</h3>
<p>Roaming in Hangzhou and Jiaxing, Berthing in Zhapu at Midnight</p>
<p>Bandits Search and Rob, Returning Empty-Handed to Shanghai</p>
<p>The wife of Zheng Xiangru, who lives in Zhabei and is in the foreign goods business, recently gathered her girlfriends to burn incense in Hangzhou. She hired Yang Er, a Wuxi fast boat, and set off from Shanghai on the 12th of this month. There were more than ten people in the party, all women, and several maids. They arrived in Hangzhou on the 16th and finished burning incense. They asked Yang's boat to go to Jiaxing to visit the Misty Rain Tower and other famous scenic spots for a day. On the way back on the 18th, they passed through various towns and stopped to play. They sailed to Zhapu and it was dark. Mrs. Zheng asked Yang's boat to dock overnight and return to Shanghai the next day. Yang's boat docked. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, three or four small boats came, with two or three bandits in each boat. They rushed onto the boat, shone electric torches into the cabin, and the women, who were mostly asleep, woke up in shock upon hearing the noise and screamed. The bandits took out guns to threaten them and prevent them from making noise. The bandits searched everywhere and opened the boxes that everyone had brought. All the silver dollars were robbed, and the female passengers were forced to take off their rings and bracelets. The female passengers were frightened and stunned. After searching, they also searched Yang's boat and robbed Yang of sixty or seventy yuan and a leather suitcase. Before leaving, they fired a shot into the sky, and the bandits boarded the pirate ships and fled west. Mrs. Zheng and the other women were robbed of silver dollars and jewelry worth about a thousand yuan. One of the women was robbed of the most valuable items and injured her left hand. Yesterday, Yang's boat arrived in Shanghai, and the women returned home disappointed, complaining that the gods did not protect them.</p>
<h3>Case of Fraud at Xiangxing Solved</h3>
<p>Thirty-Nine Cases of Raw Oil</p>
<p>Xiangxing North Goods Store, located at No. 1 Tongan Lane, New Pier Street, Nanshi, this port, is opened by Wang Zhengxiang from Haizhou. It has been in business for many years and its business is considered to be quite developed. On the 11th of this month, a broker claiming to be surnamed Gu went to the store to buy thirty-nine cases of raw oil, the value of which was stated to be $213.75. The said Gu then hired a small cart to load the goods and instructed the store owner, Wang Zhengxiang, to follow him to No. 70 Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, Public Concession to collect the money. Thereupon, Wang took a car and followed Gu to the place. Unexpectedly, Gu entered through the front door and escaped through the back door without a trace. Wang, having waited for a long time without seeing Gu pay the money, became suspicious. He then inquired at the house, but all replied that they did not know. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived. He immediately turned around and returned to the store to report, and suspected that the raw oil was loaded by the cart driver Yin Xiaokun, fearing that he might be in collusion with the fraud. He immediately reported the above to the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting investigation and arrest. After receiving the report, Captain Lu immediately ordered the Detective Team leader Wu Kezhong, detectives Dai Hongzhang, Chen Sirong, etc. to investigate separately. Later, the cart driver Yin Xiaokun was arrested at No. 12 Xiaocai Market, Zhonghua Xin Road, Zhabei, and the buyers of the stolen goods Feng Baosheng, Shen Xinting, and Rong Ruiting were arrested separately in the Chinese Concession. Twenty-one cases of the original stolen raw oil and two empty cases were recovered. They were escorted to the police station and transferred to the Detective Team for detention and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiang Xiangrong Crushed to Death by Belt</h3>
<p>Jiang Xiangrong, a Shaoxing native residing in Chongxin Workshop, Xiaoshadu, 47 years old, had been working as a laborer in the Dachang oil pressing machine room. On April 10, while working, his clothes were caught in the belt, and his body fell into the belt's rotating shaft, crushing his head and chest.

<h3>Xia Guisheng Arrested for Adultery and Abduction of Widow</h3>
<p>Three Men and Women Detained in Suzhou</p>
<p>Shen Chen, a widow from Nanjing, 45 years old, runs Shen Yongxing Redwood Workshop at No. 58 Lingji Street, Yuxing Bridge, Dadongmen, Nanshi. The business is doing well and she has some savings. However, her husband and son have died one after another. In addition to her younger son Sanbao, her widowed daughter-in-law Shen Wu (23 years old), and grandson Guilin (6 years old), she also has an adopted daughter, 19 years old. The household expenses depend entirely on the redwood workshop and rent. However, Shen Wu is quite attractive. Shen Chen, considering that she is young and a widow, and that although she has a child, she may not be able to maintain her chastity, provides her with food and a monthly allowance of twenty yuan. Unexpectedly, Shen Wu is not accustomed to widowhood and often takes Guilin to play in the Xiaoshijie in the city, where she was seduced by Xia Guisheng from Suzhou who sings Tanhuang. Shen Wu, being young and inexperienced, was eventually tempted into adultery. She became intimate with Xia and they have been together for three years. At that time, Shen Chen noticed it, but because of her reputation, she did not make it public. Unexpectedly, Xia Guisheng became more and more brazen, and on the 13th of this month, he instigated Shen Wu to take the child Guilin, and steal gold jewelry including a gold bracelet, a gold hair clasp, five gold rings, a pair of gold earrings, a string of pearls, two inlaid rings, a black sheepskin robe and other clothes in a large package, as well as copper and tin utensils and other sundry items, and eloped without a trace. On the same day, the railway police of the Two-Way Management Bureau of the North Railway Station suspected their behavior and detained Xia Guisheng, Shen Wu, and Guilin for one night. Because there was no plaintiff to pursue the matter, they were released. Later, Shen Chen reported Shen Wu's elopement to the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting investigation. Detectives Xie Wanlin and Xu Zhaochang of the team learned that the railway police had intercepted and released them and that they had taken a train to Suzhou. The detectives went to Suzhou the day before yesterday and, together with detectives from the Suzhou Public Security Bureau, arrested the abductor Xia Guisheng, Shen Wu, and the child Guilin at Zhang Taihe Firecracker Shop, No. 49 Nianzhu Street, Xumen, and brought them back to the team. During interrogation, the abductor Xia Guisheng confessed that he was from Suzhou, residing at No. 12 Linde Lane, Fangbang Road, Shanghai, and made a living by singing Tanhuang at Xiaoshijie. He admitted that he had arrived in Suzhou on the 14th and confessed to seduction and abduction. When questioned, Shen Wu's confession was the same. After verifying the confessions, the captain of the team detained them and transferred them for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Gangsters "Pai San He Tu"</h3>
<p>A Hawker Faints</p>
<p>The areas of Ningbo Road and Rue Minitié and Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession are gathering places for hawkers. It is common for unemployed gangsters to extort cigarette money from the hawkers, resulting in fights and brawls. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, a similar incident occurred in front of the Ruixing Lane entrance opposite the Sino-French School. A hawker was subjected to "Pai San He Tu" (grabbing limbs and slamming them forcefully on the road) by five or six gangsters in the middle of the road, causing him to faint. The gangsters, seeing the trouble they had caused, tried to flee in a panic. Fortunately, a patrolman happened to pass by and caught the leader. He also tried to revive the hawker who had fainted. Then, he hired a car to take the injured person and the assailant to the Avenue Joffre Police Station to report to the head of the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wu Runmin Detained for Fraud</h3>
<p>Defrauding Money in the Name of Appealing on Behalf of Others</p>
<p>Yang Yi, a woman from Jiangbei, whose husband, Cunfu, was sentenced to death by the First Special District Local Court for robbery and other cases, was running around to rescue him. Through Zhou Xinquan, she met Wu Runmin, a man from Jiangbei, who claimed that he could handle the appeal. On March 14, she went to Wu's house with Zhou. There was a sign for the Twelfth Law Office of Jinzhi at the entrance, and Wu's business card stated that he was the director of the office. He ordered her to pay $5 first to prepare a petition and told her to go and check the approval herself. The woman searched everywhere at the notice board in front of the court, but could not find any approval. The next day, Wu copied out an approved instruction, saying that it was copied from the clerk's office because they were classmates, so it was convenient. He then ordered her to pay a public fee of $40. The woman paid $20 first, and Wu issued a receipt. Unexpectedly, on April 11, the defendants in the same case were all tried in court, but Yang Yi's husband was not mentioned, indicating that no appeal had been filed. Zhou and the woman demanded the money back from Wu. Unexpectedly, Wu went to the Nanshi Local Court to accuse Zhou and the woman of extortion and fraud. Yesterday, Judge Kong summoned Zhou and the woman for questioning. Zhou and the woman recounted the previous events and presented evidence. The judge believed that Wu himself had committed fraud, so he detained Wu and waited for the lawyer to come to the court for questioning.</p>

<h3>Preface to the Shen Bao Yearbook</h3>
<p>By Zhang Zisheng</p>
<p>"It is a scholar's shame to be ignorant of anything." This is an ancient saying.</p>
<p>"Scholars do not go out, yet they know the affairs of the world." In the past, knowledge was the exclusive property of the scholar-official class, and only scholars could "know the affairs of the world." However, in our era, it is different. Knowledge has become a necessity of life for the masses. A good citizen in the modern era must understand the common sense of politics, law, economics, society, and military affairs, and must understand the general trend of the country and the world. Whether it is a farmer, a businessman, a worker, or a student, a producer or a consumer, if they do not have a considerable understanding of all modern activities, even personal life will feel many difficulties, let alone serve the country and society.</p>
<p>The aspects of modern human activities are very broad and interconnected. Modern human production has changed from self-sufficient rural production to social production and national production. Professor of the Tokyo National Academy of Music, with many years of experience and profound artistry, occupies an important position in the modern music world. Four years ago, he toured the world with the world-renowned violinist Ms. Hanson, giving many concerts, which were very popular among the public. When he passed through Shanghai, Xiao Youmei, the president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, was shocked by his reputation and sincerely recruited him to be the director of the piano group. He has a large number of talented students, such as Li Xianmin and Jiu Fusheng, who will graduate this summer. It is heard that in addition to a public banquet to celebrate, the colleagues of the school will also give gifts as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Stations</h3>
<p>Tianyi Company Self-Operated Radio Station Tianyi Film Company previously jointly operated a radio station with the China Radio Research Society. The machine part was handled by China, while Tianyi was responsible for the programs. It officially started broadcasting on February 1st and lasted for two months, with good results. However, the frequency of the station was 1140, which often interfered with other stations, resulting in unclear sound, which was a pity for the listeners. Now the company has rebuilt it on its own, named Tianyi Broadcasting Radio Station, with the equipment installed by the Asia Electric Company. The power is greater than before. It is currently preparing and has applied to the International Telecommunications Bureau for a test license, specifying the wavelength, frequency, and call sign. As soon as the preparations are completed, broadcasting can begin.</p>
<p>Youlian Broadcasting Station Adds Programs From today (21st), from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM every afternoon, the Zhenhua Paint Company will rent the Youlian Company Broadcasting Radio Station at No. 419 Avenue Joffre and hire the famous storyteller Chen Lianqing and Qi Lianfang to sing and perform the book "Xiao Jin Qian". The station's radio wave is 880 kilocycles.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcasts Christian Lectures The International Bible Research Association has been broadcasting on the Zhongxi Broadcasting Station X CD every Sunday afternoon from 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM for seven times. It is heard that starting this Sunday, all the topics have been set: One, the Kingdom of God; Two, the End of the World; Three, the Battle of Armageddon; Four, the Transformation of the World. These five topics have a thorough and rational explanation of the causes of the current panic. The lectures are in English and translated by Mr. Chen Shiyan.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor-in-chief of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Respectfully, I have read the section on local news in your newspaper on the 18th, which states that a treacherous merchant was caught smuggling Japanese fish, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. Now, I will tell you the true situation: At 3:00 AM on the 17th of this month, the Jinbaoli fishing boat entered the port and offered to sell to our firm. Because the customer was unfamiliar, our firm found the situation suspicious. When asked about the origin, the customer suddenly avoided meeting. Our firm reported to the water patrol police station and the customs. The customs sent personnel to monitor the action. However, the report in your newspaper is completely contrary to the facts. I am afraid that it will be misleading, so I am telling you the truth and hope that you will correct it in the letter column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Qiafeng Fish Bank</p>
<p>April 20th</p>
<h3>Lost and Found</h3>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: The sky on the coast of Shandong is cloudy, and the wind is from the northeast. The sky in the Yangtze River basin and the coastal area south of Ma'an Island is overcast with local heavy fog. The wind is from the north to the east. The temperature in the local port in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday: the highest was 65.1 and the lowest was 48.9. On the same day last year, the highest was 70.9 and the lowest was 52.5.</p>
<p>After discussions of dozens of colleagues, the editor-in-chief, editors, and special writers, reached thirty-one people, and with the cooperation of people from all walks of life, we were able to meet the people of the country. We feel that it is even more memorable: the first publication of the Shen Bao Yearbook coincides with the day of deep national crisis. The country and the nation are enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, preparing their weapons and sharpening their swords in order to resist foreign aggression. Naturally, the Chinese nation has only one way out: to fight bravely, resist Japan, and oppose imperialism. However, with the complexity of modern national organizations, politics, economy, and culture are closely related to national defense. Moreover, the domestic situation and the international situation are intertwined and inseparable. If the entire nation does not have a deep understanding of the internal and external situations, it will not be able to resist foreign aggression and eliminate national disasters by relying solely on courage. Mr. Sun Yat-sen had the legacy of knowing is difficult but doing is easy. Ignorance is the nation's greatest weakness. The publication of the Shen Bao Yearbook is the greatest expectation of the colleagues if it can be of some service to the work of resisting Japan and opposing imperialism by increasing national awareness!</p>
<p>Finally, we should thank all parties for their support and hope that all enthusiastic and caring gentlemen will point out our shortcomings!</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>The Central Political Conference Decides that Wang Shijie Will Be the Minister of Education</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The interim Central Political Conference held after the Standing Committee meeting resolved to appoint Wang Shijie, the president of Wuhan University, as the Minister of Education. The vacancy of the president will be filled by Tong Gengsheng, the director of the Department of Political Science of the university.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders that Libraries of Schools in Tianjin and Beijing Should Be Relocated</h3>
<p>(Beiping, 20th) The Ministry of Education instructed that the libraries of schools in Tianjin and Beijing should be relocated. Currently, only Peking University is relocating first.</p>
<h3>Reform of the School System in Southwest China</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Submitted to the Executive Yuan Requesting that it Not Be Implemented, Which Has Been Approved</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The Ministry of Education stated that the Southwest Political Committee's decision to reform the school system, abolish winter and summer vacations, the length of study in schools at all levels, stipulated that primary and secondary schools each have five years and universities three to five years, and that it would hinder students' physical and mental rest and learning adjustment. Moreover, shortening the length of study would not only make it difficult to maintain the existing level of content in each subject, but also require a complete change in the allocation of teaching materials for each subject, and it is difficult to determine whether it can be implemented without hindrance. According to convention, students enter school at the age of six and graduate from primary school at the age of ten. Students graduate from secondary school at the age of sixteen. Generally, students lack a personal understanding of the subjects they study, whether they are natural or social sciences. Graduation from university is at the age of nineteen, which is still lower than the legal adult age of twenty, and they feel that they lack experience, which is contrary to common sense. Moreover, the national school system was originally unified. If some provinces suddenly act differently, it will not only disrupt the school system, but also make it difficult to transfer students to schools and for graduates to obtain qualifications and appointments. The Ministry of Education ordered the Guangdong Education Department not to implement it, and prepared opinions to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Guangdong Provincial Government for non-implementation. It is heard that the Yuan's order was approved on the 20th.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Plans to Improve Primary Schools Across the Country</h3>

<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The Ministry of Education plans to rectify and improve primary schools across the country with six measures: Independent senior primary schools should all add junior primary schools, non-experimental primary schools should change their names, and primary schools should all establish research associations, etc. The Ministry issued orders to the education departments of all provinces and cities on the 20th to comply.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Issues a Circular to All Provinces and Cities to Strictly Hold Entrance Examinations</h3>
<p>Refuting the Request of Private Schools in Beijing to Change the Entrance Examination Method</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The Ministry of Education stated that the level of graduates from public and private primary and secondary schools in all provinces and cities is highly inconsistent. Although most schools are able to strictly hold entrance and grade placement examinations, they are often not very serious about teaching, which is not a trivial matter that misleads students, and the society and the country are harmed as a result. On the 20th, the Ministry specially issued a circular to the education departments of all provinces and cities to strictly follow the temporary regulations on entrance examinations and the repeated orders, and to strictly hold entrance examinations without being negligent, so as to attach importance to education.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The presidents of private secondary schools in Beijing previously jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to instruct the Social Bureau to revise the entrance examination method. The Ministry of Education stated that the entrance examination for primary and secondary school graduates is to encourage educational progress and has repeatedly issued orders to strictly hold it. The several revised entrance examination methods proposed by the presidents of private secondary schools in Beijing either do not match the facts or contradict laws and regulations. In addition to detailed explanations, they were severely refuted and ordered to comply.</p>
<p>Local News</p>
<p>French Authorities Force Private Schools to Suspend Classes</p>
<p>School Principals Petition the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Requesting Serious Negotiations with the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>(Dagong News) The French Municipal Council has recently successively forced private schools in the concession to suspend classes without announcing the reasons. The principals of the schools believe that this move by the French authorities is clearly to destroy our country's education, and they have jointly petitioned the municipal government and the municipal education bureau to negotiate with the French authorities to immediately resume classes so as to prevent thousands of children in the concession from wasting their time and losing their education. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the truth, the Municipal Education Bureau has submitted a request to the government for instructions. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Chen Yingxian, the principal of the Leyuan Elementary School, and others went to the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Government to request negotiations for the resumption of classes. They first went to the Municipal Education Bureau, where they were received by Tang Jingxiu, an inspector of the bureau, who agreed to immediately investigate the truth of the French Municipal Council's order to suspend classes and then submit a request to the Municipal Government to negotiate with the French authorities. Then, they went to the Municipal Government, where they were received by Secretary Geng. The representatives stated that more than a dozen primary and secondary schools in the French Concession have been suspended in recent days without any reasons being announced. If the school facilities are inadequate or the management is poor, the French Municipal Council may send personnel to thoroughly investigate together with the Municipal Education Bureau. Unexpectedly, the French Municipal Council notified the schools on the 11th of this month and ordered them to suspend classes on the 13th. The schools are concerned that the long-term absence from classes will endanger the children's education, so they requested Secretary Geng to forward a request to the mayor to consult with the French authorities to resume classes first, and then discuss the negotiations. Secretary Geng agreed to call the Municipal Education Bureau to inquire about the investigation and then negotiate with the French authorities. If it is a local problem, it will be easy to solve. If it is a strategy of the French authorities, the Municipal Government must submit a request to the central government to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate with the French side.</p>

<h3>Scout Expert Mr. Gu Zhenglai's Remains to be Buried Today</h3>
<p>Scout expert and former President of the Chinese Physical Education School, Mr. Gu Zhenglai, was admired for his learning and moral character. He dedicated his life to the country, committing himself to the Scout movement for the army, navy, and air force, supporting the revolution, and managing charitable affairs. His heroic achievements throughout his life are too numerous to mention. During this time of national crisis, when talent is urgently needed, unfortunately, Mr. Gu personally supervised the South City Defense Corps during the January 28th Incident last year, defending the local area, working tirelessly day and night. This led to overwork and illness. Despite treatment from both Chinese and Western medicine, the remedies proved ineffective, and he passed away at his Shanghai residence on July 7th of last year. Friends and relatives, close and distant, were deeply saddened by the news. Mr. Gu's lifelong friends, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Boling, Li Qifan, Ye Caizhen, Feng Liming, Huang Renzhi, and Shen Xinqing, are handling his funeral arrangements. It has been decided that today at 2:30 PM, a burial ceremony will be held for Mr. Gu's remains at the Christian cemetery in Song Park, Zhabei. Reverend Li from Moore Memorial Church will preside over the service, following Mr. Gu's wishes for a simple funeral. Trainees from the board of directors' Scout instructor training course and classmates will respectfully carry the coffin, moving from Yongxi Hall, turning from Taixielu Road onto Zhongshan Road, and proceeding to the Baptist Moore Memorial Garden on Song Park Road in Zhabei. It is also reported that senior officials and teams from the South City Defense Corps will participate. Mr. Gu had friends all over the country, and it is expected that many will participate in carrying the coffin, expressing their condolences.</p>

The students were full of energy, eloquent, and skilled in rhetoric. In particular, Zhang Zonghu, a student in the upper primary class, was very young but spoke with articulate diction, moving the audience and eliciting continuous applause throughout the hall.

<h3>New Initiatives at Private Minsheng Primary School</h3>
<p>Shanghai Private Minsheng Primary School is located at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Belles, in a quiet and refreshing environment. Founded over twenty years ago, the school has seen a significant increase in students this year, making the existing buildings insufficient. It is reported that the school plans to dedicate all three of its buildings entirely to classrooms, while teacher dormitories will be rented elsewhere. To cultivate female vocational talent, the school plans to add a girls' vocational middle school next semester. The authorities are currently drafting a plan, which will soon be submitted to the Education Bureau for review.</p>

<p>Shooting Competition, Group A</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda Achieves Great Luck</p>
<p>Defeats Veteran Shen Lince in Final Shot</p>
<p>Result: 1000 Points to 986</p>
<p>Benal Ill, No Competition Today</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda enjoyed great luck in his final shot, defeating veteran Shen Lince to advance to the semi-finals in the Shanghai Amateur Group A shooting competition. He will soon compete against shooting champion Li Gongying. The match between the two was extremely slow, with each round lasting over three hours. The situation was dull until the later rounds, when it became tense. Shen had the advantage in the first round, leading with 500 points to 398. However, in the second round, Zhang shot smoothly. Even at the twentieth shot, Zhang was still 100 points behind (585 to 685). He then rallied, scoring 36, 44, 14, 5, and 12 in the next five shots, pulling ahead with 695 to 692. From then on, both sides scored high, averaging similar scores, with Shen regaining the lead shortly after. However, the difference was minimal. Nearing the end, Shen was still leading with 986 to 975. Unexpectedly, Zhang scored 25 points on his final shot, securing the final victory with 1000 points to 986. Shen can be said to have been extremely unlucky. British veteran Benal is ill, and his match today against Medina has been cancelled.</p>

<p>To Compete Against Tujin in Finals Next Monday</p>
<p>The Youyou Cup basketball tournament game between Youyi and Quanhei last night was extremely tense from the start. Youyi's Wang Caigao was the most outstanding player. Quanhei initially led with 8 to 5, but Youyi worked hard to catch up to 11 to 12, trailing by only one point. Quanhei's Hu Zhouzhi and Jia Youliang each made long shots, while Youyi suffered from passing errors. At halftime, the score was 22 to 19, with Quanhei leading. At the start of the second half, Youyi was more active, using short, quick passes. At this time, Quanhei's Hua Fenggang had already committed four fouls. Youyi took the lead with 23 to 22. From then on, Youyi surged ahead, and Quanhei was unable to mount a defense. The final score was 42 to 36, with Youyi winning the right to compete in the finals. It is reported that Youyi will compete against Tujin for the championship at 7:00 PM next Monday, the 24th. The results from last night are listed below:</p>

<h3>Reform of Private Schools</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The term "reform of private schools" appears from time to time in educational news. Upon seeing this term, I cannot help but recall the work of private school reform twenty-nine years ago.</p>
<p>At that time, my colleagues from the Jiangsu Provincial Higher School organized a night school for a Private School Reform Association in Suzhou, recruiting general private school teachers to teach them simple normal school methods. I was in charge of grammar, and when I lectured on the usage of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., it aroused the interest of many private school teachers who were twice my age, simply because they had never heard of it before.</p>
<p>Later, the school gradually developed, and the call for private school reform gradually faded. Now, nearly thirty years later, the slogan of private school reform is suddenly being shouted again, which makes me feel bewildered. If private schools needed reform twenty-nine years ago, and they still need reform twenty-nine years later, when will they ever be reformed? The equipment of private schools is very simple, yet they have been reformed for nearly thirty years without improvement. What else can be said?</p>
<p>Recently, the magistrate of Sanshui County, Guangdong Province, has ordered the sealing and dissolution of all private schools. For those who disobey, the county government has ordered the Public Security Bureau, saying: "They dare to disobey orders while the ink is not yet dry, which is an extreme violation of the law. The director of the bureau is ordered to immediately expel the teachers from the county. If they continue to resist, they will be arrested and brought to the government for punishment." This decisive magistrate of Sanshui County treats teachers as bandits. He believes that private schools are all bad and is fundamentally eliminating them, which is certainly a very straightforward approach. However, I fear that the teachers will ask in return: "If private schools are bad, are all schools really good?" I believe that a compromise solution is needed: the reform of private schools and the reform of schools should proceed simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Dream Talk</h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>Those semi-traitorous, soon-to-be-enslaved people, craning their necks and respectfully waiting for the Imperial Army to raise their hands and grant them the honor of tasting a Japanese sword, if they want to be happy, the best way is still to rest their heads on a high, three-foot-three-inch pillow and pursue a dream of paradise.</p>
<p>A bellyful of righteous indignation, wanting to take the stage to express myself, or announce it with my pen, but I cannot bear to sacrifice the rice bowl that I have shared with the enemy for decades, so I am timid and shrinking, and finally just shrink my head. In a dream, you can speak frankly without being blamed.</p>
<p>A bellyful of articles about governing the country and pacifying the world, having fished out all the big and small fish in Qinhuai and Xuanwu, but alas, no King Wen is even glancing at me. In a dream, I can overthrow you, and I can come.</p>
<p>Those who do not have a good appetite do not expect these, but seeing how Brother Zhang has hoarded silver and gold, dancing with beautiful women, and playing golf with foreigners, how can they not be envious? In a dream, I want more than anyone, to be even happier than him.</p>
<p>Looking for food, spitting out all my anger. Looking at the boss, not even the big boss's face is enough, the head clerk, the second clerk, will also put on a pretentious air. Even if I spit out all my anger, I have to swallow the broken teeth down into my stomach. In a dream, I can overthrow those who should be overthrown, and expel those who should be expelled, to vent my anger.</p>
<p>After twelve hours of sweating, the reward I get is not enough to fill the stomachs of my family of eight. On the first and fifteenth of the month, when I want to eat meat, I buy three hundred cash worth of pork neck, but I have already borrowed two hundred cash with high interest. In a dream, I can feast without paying.</p>
<p>All year round, the medicine pot never leaves my side, and I am as thin as a twig. The efficacy of the medicine is like plain water, I am just in a hurry, and I have no hope of getting out of bed. In a dream, I can regain my health, go to Hangzhou, visit Longhua, and do whatever I want.</p>
<p>The most perfect people have no dreams, and fools talk about dreams. But even our great sage and teacher Confucius still dreamed of the Duke of Zhou. It can be seen that dreaming is not something that cannot be brought into the hall of elegance.</p>
<p>In this era, nine out of ten people are running into walls everywhere. Being a monk, jumping into the Huangpu River, not knowing how to have fun in a dream, are all fools. To live drunk and die dreaming, to see life as a dream, is to be perfect.</p>
<h3>On Seeing a Rubbing of a Bronze Bell Presented by a Buddhist Association as a Memorial to the Japanese Earthquake, I Composed a Poem; at That Time, There Was Another Earthquake in Hokkaido, Japan, and the Battle of Rehe Was in Full Swing</h3>
<p>— Jiamenglū</p>
<p>After the bell rings, the sound of cannons comes, and the haze over the mainland does not dissipate. Not living under the same sky nor treading the same earth, who remembers this lung and liver being torn apart?</p>
<p>Wiping away the red kerchief to mourn the nation, the people are still in dire straits. The Pu Lao roars across the sea, can its voice be heard on the battlefield?</p>
<p>Skill in warfare has always been a top punishment, how can repentance reach the underworld? The hearts of the people are dead, and Heaven is tired of it, no wonder the rocks stir up the anger of thunder.</p>
<p>God is silent, and a hundred ghosts are snarling, (borrowed line) myriad grievances are among the living. The blood flowers fly, and the heavenly flowers fall, the pestle of the clear bell illuminates the bright moon.</p>
<p>If the poetry circles in the country would like to offer a harmony (regardless of style), I respectfully offer Yi Shifu's Qin Zhi Lou poems in return, a total of eight volumes of mountain travel poems, twelve volumes of chronological poems, and four volumes of poems from the Renzi and Jiayin years. The amount of return will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The entire collection is stored in one box and will be given away until it is empty.

<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five</p>
<p>Brewing Tea to Pass the Long Night, Grieving at the Year's End</p>
<p>Addressing the Violent Day of Resistance, Shouting Loudly</p>
<p>Yang Guizhi was about to argue with the shop assistant at the pawnshop over the one dollar difference in the price of the clothing when someone called out from behind. Turning around, she saw Zhao Ziqiang running after her. Guizhi blushed and said, "Company Commander Zhao, you've come here too." Zhao Ziqiang laughed, "I heard my orderly say that the 'old girl' took the cotton clothing out the front gate, so I asked your old mother what that was about. Your old mother said that they were still short three dollars for the New Year and had taken the clothing to pawn for money. I thought, why make such a fuss over such a small matter and pawn your cotton clothes in this cold weather? We'll get paid soon for the New Year; I can cover it for you. Let's go back." As he spoke, he took the roll of clothing down from the counter, tucked it under his arm, and led the way. At this point, the "old girl" couldn't help but follow him, and she resented the pawnshop assistant for being so unfeeling. She turned back and glared fiercely at the assistant behind the counter, then followed Zhao Ziqiang out onto the street. This Company Commander Zhao was different from Gan Erye. He was very reserved, always walking ahead of Guizhi without turning his head, let alone talking. The two hurried along, and soon arrived at the house. Jiang was already at the front gate, taking the clothing with both hands and bowing repeatedly to Zhao Ziqiang, saying, "Thank you, thank you, how could we ask you to help us with such a big favor? After the New Year, when I have some money, I'll definitely repay you in full." After speaking to Zhao Ziqiang she said to Guizhi: "You don't know, Company Commander Zhao is such a good person. He heard that our family was being pressed by creditors and lent them five dollars for the New Year, so they have money to spend after paying off their debts. How can we feel good about letting Company Commander Zhao help us with such a big favor for no reason?" Zhao Ziqiang smiled and waved his hands twice, saying, "Don't say it, don't say it, it's embarrassing to talk about it." Without waiting for Jiang to say anything more, he walked away. Guizhi walked into the house, frowning and complaining to her mother, "You're acting recklessly. How can we accept money from someone for no reason?" Jiang said, "I said so too. But he specifically came to ask me, so I couldn't help but tell the truth." (48)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on a Poor Spring</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been quite cool and cold. Although the plum blossoms have already bloomed and are now fading, the peach blossoms are definitely blooming later than in previous years.</p>
<p>The northeast wind has been blowing constantly. Waking up in the morning, the warm sunshine from the morning sun warms the pillow, and I smile inwardly, thinking, "On such a clear and bright spring morning, wouldn't you want to go to Nanping to listen to the bells of the ancient temple?"</p>
<p>However, from the distant forest, I hear the diligent cries of the quails. In our village, there's a folk song that says: "Quail, much wind and much rain." My brows furrow again. It seems that the cries of these birds can predict wind and rain. Often, farmers carry umbrellas in the sunlight to the market, only to return to the village in the rain.</p>
<p>The sunny mornings are like the weather in May, and you can wear a single shirt. But then a strong wind blows, black clouds swell up and spread like ink, and cold rain pours down torrentially. Small ditches can be used for swimming ducklings, and the shadows of sails can float up to the second floor. At that time, if you don't wear a thick camel wool robe, your temples will soon start to burn. There's a saying in the village: "When going out, beware of the third and ninth months." That refers to the lunar calendar, but it's said to be very accurate.</p>
<p>On this day two years ago, after viewing the plum blossoms at Damingtang in Chaoshan (now damaged by thieves), I returned to Tangqi by boat. The weather was still clear, sunny, and warm. But in the afternoon, as I went with the monk Shipiao to the Hupao Temple, the wind and clouds suddenly changed color. Rain, mixed with snow, fell in a flurry, followed by hailstones. I was wearing a woolen hat, so it wasn't so bad, but Shipiao's bald head was hit by egg-sized hailstones, breaking the skin and splattering out bright red blood. We had to take temporary shelter under a small tree for a while. By the time the hail stopped and we continued on, our clothes were completely soaked. Shipiao still has scars on his head to this day, so he's also known as "Sick Gourd," and is currently reciting scriptures at the Jingci Temple in Hangzhou. As for me, I caught a bout of malarial fever upon returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Because of this lesson, in this strange year, I'm afraid of being tricked by the unpredictable weather, and I'm not carrying many heavy items when I travel. That's why I'm still wandering around in Shanghai, a city that devours souls, from early morning to late at night.</p>
<h3>After Visiting the Sincere Company's Exhibition of National Products in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Wenpu</p>
<p>I came from Southeast Asia, passing through Hong Kong. Having heard that the Sincere Company was holding an exhibition of national products, I visited it once. Seeing that this kind of exhibition is of great importance to people's livelihoods, and is especially urgent for our country at the present time, I have written this account to serve as a model for large department stores in various cities, as a means of learning from each other.</p>
<p>The exhibition hall was set up on the company's rooftop, with beautiful arrangements and orderly organization. Silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, and other products were categorized and displayed in order. Participating manufacturers came from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, totaling dozens of companies. Visitors came to see the exhibition enthusiastically. Famous figures such as Cai Tingkai, Tan Qixiu, Liu Jiwen, Zhang Yan, and Zou Minchu, among others, all visited the exhibition one after another. Various groups and organizations also came in teams, which was enough to demonstrate the public's mentality of loving and using national products. It was truly an encouraging act amidst the national crisis. I have lived in Southeast Asia for several decades. There, the overseas Chinese depend on foreigners for their clothing, food, and housing. Although they have the desire to love and use national products, there are actually no exquisite national products to buy. The money spent on foreign goods each year amounts to no less than ten million. Now that national products have made such progress and are so excellent, if overseas Chinese can be made aware of this, they will surely be happy to adopt and compete to buy them. I sincerely hope that the Sincere Company's authorities will gradually expand the national product exhibition to promote national products, arouse the public to uniformly use national products, and make the public generally recognize the advantages of national products. The national economy and people's livelihoods will truly benefit from this.</p>

<p>Swallows are chattering and murmuring on the beams; tender shoots are emerging from the soil in the bamboo groves. This is truly the harmonious season of spring, and also the time when swallow bamboo shoots are on the market.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang have a lot of bamboo planting, no matter in the mountains or on the plains, thousands of jade green poles and tens of thousands of emerald hairpin-like leaves are everywhere. However, the shoots that grow in the mountain bamboo forests are large and hairy, commonly called "hairy shoots," and are suitable for roasting or drying. Those dug in the bamboo gardens in the countryside have different names depending on the season. In February and March, they are called "swallow shoots" because the swallows are just returning from the south at this time. Later, they are called "chicken shoots" because it is truly the time when chicks hatch. The latest kind is called "late sprout shoots," which are available in mid-May.</p>
<p>Invite three or five good friends, buy a jar of country wine, and call the village children to dig fresh bamboo shoots in the bamboo garden, then immediately ask the family to cook them. The bamboo flavor is tender and sweet; the bamboo soup is fresh and clean. Such flavors are probably hard to come by in Shanghai.</p>
<p>As soon as the thunder roars, the bamboo shoots grow rapidly. If the weather is sunny and cold, they grow very slowly. Not only do people like to chew on them, but wild boars and other animals secretly run into the bamboo garden on windy and moonless nights to eat them raw and whole.</p>
<p>The bamboo of Ningdong is the hairy bamboo mentioned above. Every year, a "shoot king" emerges, which is extraordinarily large. There are two shoots beside it that are slightly shorter, called "shoot generals." The outer skin of the shoot tip has a brocade band that is more than a foot long, like the pheasant feathers that ancient people inserted in their hats. People don't dare to dig and eat them. If they accidentally remove them, the family will suffer a strange disaster. This is recorded in ancient books. Whether or not this is true remains to be asked of the people of this place.</p>
<h3>Baby Coconut</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that coconut shell ash (charcoal?) can be used for military defense against poisonous gas, so I thought of everything about coconuts.</p>
<p>Coconuts originally come from the islands of Southeast Asia, but quite a few are imported to Guangdong every year. Therefore, coconuts have become a very popular food in Guangdong, and there is no one in Guangdong who does not know coconuts.</p>
<p>If you go to Guangdong, the easiest place to find coconuts is on the stands selling "salty, sour, and sweet" snacks. Every "salty, sour, and sweet" stand or stall has coconuts, cut into triangular pieces or long strips, as white as mutton fat jade, soaked in clear water. And, sellers of coconuts on "salty, sour, and sweet" stands always sell them together with pickled ginger slices. People who eat them also like to eat both together.</p>
<p>The term "salty, sour, and sweet" stand can be understood by its name. The stand sells pickled, sour, salty, and sweet fruits and vegetables, such as pickled cucumbers, vinegar-soaked mustard tubers, sour and spicy vegetables, pickled radishes, pickled chili peppers, sweet papaya slices, and salty sand pears. Salty items include jellyfish and loach. The stand has a small stove and pot, ready to cook jellyfish and loach. This kind of stand can also be seen in the Hongkou area of Shanghai.</p>
<p>When I was young, both pickled ginger and coconuts sold for two small coins a slice. Now, coconuts sell for two or three copper coins.</p>
<p>Coconuts also have a place in the New Year's candy box. They are cooked with sugar and dried. One type is cut into flat strips, called sugar coconut shreds, and the other is cut into triangular blocks, called sugar coconut cubes. Because it has a lot of residue and little juice, I never liked to eat it much.</p>
<p>Also, half a coconut is used in engagement gifts, shaped like a ladle, with dragon, phoenix, and double happiness patterns painted on it in gold.</p>
<p>Now, pastry shops have a type of pastry called coconut tart (tart is a transliteration of "tart"), which is topped with very fine coconut shreds mixed with sugar juice.</p>
<p>Coconut juice, extracted by grinding the coconut, must be added to curry chicken to make it taste good. Outsiders who make curry chicken don't understand this point and will never make good curry chicken.</p>
<p>After buying a whole coconut to take home, first remove the coconut husk, and then use a nail or similar object to make a hole in the coconut shell, letting the coconut juice, a white liquid like milk, flow out. This juice is not very useful except as a drink, and it tastes slightly sweet. Then, use a saw to cut the coconut shell in half. After the coconut meat is dug out for eating, the two halves of the coconut shell are used as water ladles. Guangdong soldiers often carry such a coconut ladle with them. Sometimes, when the coconut ladle breaks, the pieces become materials for our handicrafts.</p>

<h3>"Using Barbarians to Control Barbarians"</h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>I still remember that when many people in China were complaining to the League of Nations last year, Japanese newspapers often ridiculed them, saying that this was the old trick of "using barbarians to control barbarians" inherited from Chinese ancestors. At first glance, it seemed somewhat similar, but in reality, it was not. At that time, many people in China indeed regarded the League of Nations as the "just and upright official," and there was not even a trace of the word "barbarian" in their minds.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the "just and upright officials" often used the method of "using Chinese to control Chinese."</p>
<p>For example, the "criminals" who they deeply hated for being anti-imperialist were not made villains by them, but were freely and easily handed over to the Chinese, telling you to kill them yourself. The "Communist bandits" in the hinterland, whom they hated, were not explicitly commented upon by them, but they sold airplanes and bombs to the Chinese, telling you to bomb them yourself. The lower-class Chinese were dealt with by Huangdi's descendants who were police and compradors, and the intellectual class were dealt with by "upper-class Chinese" scholars and doctors.</p>
<p>The "Big Sword Team," which we had boasted about for many days, seemed impossible to subdue, but on April 15th, the "XX Newspaper" had a headline printed in the largest font: "I Slew 200 Enemies." At first glance, it was meant to make people feel victorious, but let's take a look at the content of the article:</p>
<p>" (This newspaper's Beiping dispatch today) Last night on the right wing of Xifengkou, fierce battles continued in various places east of Luanyangcheng. The enemy appeared with a Big Sword Team of a thousand men, newly arrived, confronting our Big Sword Team. Their swords were especially long, making them clumsy to use. Our army swung their swords and slashed, and the enemy was unable to block and parry. Arms and swords were cut off and lay scattered all over the ground. Our army's casualties also reached over two hundred."</p>
<p>So, this was actually "the enemy slew 200 of our soldiers." Chinese writing is truly becoming more and more difficult, like the "national gait." But that is not what I want to point out.</p>
<p>What I want to point out is that the "Big Sword Team" is a specialty that the Chinese have boasted about for a long time. Although the Japanese have swordsmanship, they are not accustomed to using the big sword. Now that they have "appeared," there is no need to hesitate to decide that they are Manchurian troops. Since the end of the Ming Dynasty, many people from Zhili and Shandong have migrated to Manchuria every year. After several generations, they have become natives, so even though they are Manchurian troops, the majority are actually Chinese, and there is no doubt about it. Now that they have each used their specialties, the big sword, they are killing each other in Luandong, with one side "arms and swords, scattered all over the ground" and the other side "casualties also reached over two hundred," enacting a very prominent scene of "using Chinese to control Chinese."</p>
<p>As for China's so-called methods, from my perspective, we should say that they exist, but they are definitely not "using barbarians to control barbarians," but rather wanting to "use barbarians to control the Chinese." However, how could the "barbarians" be so foolish? They first give you a set of "using Chinese to control Chinese" to watch.</p>
<p>This example is often seen in Chinese history. Later historians wrote eulogies for the new dynasty, calling the actions of these people "forerunners for the king"! Recent war reports are extremely astonishing. The same day, the same newspaper reported the loss of Lengkou, saying: "After the tenth day, the battle on the Lengkou front was extremely fierce. The Chinese army stubbornly resisted, hence a great battle of unprecedented intensity continued." But the Miyazaki unit, with more than ten soldiers, formed a human ladder, falling one after another, "finally crossed the Great Wall, therefore the Miyazaki unit sacrificed as many as twenty-three men." Crossing a dangerous pass, and the Japanese army only lost twenty-three men, but it is said to be "as many," and also called "a great battle of unprecedented intensity," which is a bit puzzling. Therefore, the battle of the Big Sword Team may not be as I guessed. But since it has been written, let it be left for one explanation.</p>
<h3>Internal and External Supplements</h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>Mr. He Jiagan, in his "Internal and External" essay, elucidated the reasons for differentiating between internal and external and the different methods of governing the mind, which was extremely thorough and can be read as a "record of sayings" of the Song Confucians. However, I feel that there are still omissions, so I venture to supplement some opinions, despite my humble abilities. Fortunately, we are now in the flourishing age of promoting the learning of Wang Yangming, and blessed by his virtue, we lowly people seem to have a duty to make some timely embellishments.</p>
<p>Distinguishing between internal and external is, according to the Song Confucians, only the initial step. When discussing it with true subtlety, there is also the so-called way of unifying internal and external, having no external without internal, unifying the external within the internal. Therefore, this internal is the "internal without external." At the same time, even within the mind, there is the distinction between "expressed" and "unexpressed." The intention is none other than to say: Don't care about the outside, but if you can take care of the inside, then you will have unlimited applications. Moreover, "expressed" means having a form or trace, while "unexpressed" is the whole, indescribable and unrevealable. As the ancients said, "The moral mind is subtle, the human mind is perilous." This is what it means.</p>
<p>When the Song dynasty suffered the disasters of the Liao and Jin dynasties, it is said that "Song learning" was the medicine to save the hearts of the people at that time. Now that China is in the same situation as the Song dynasty, but the Liao and Jin dynasties have been replaced by Japan, the same social situation produces the same state of consciousness and emotion. No wonder "Song learning" is reviving. The object of external trouble has changed, but what remains unchanged is China.</p>
<p>Some people doubt that the rise of "Song learning" ultimately could not save the Song dynasty from its demise. In fact, "Song learning" was a miscarriage when the Song dynasty was on the verge of demise. What is suppressed in one area must be stretched out in another. Since one has met a wall externally, one can only turn inward to seek.</p>
<p>In the end, the Liao and Jin dynasties did not destroy the Song dynasty. It was the Yuan who destroyed the Song!</p>
<h3>Rainy Day</h3>
<p>— Sha Tuo</p>
<p>Waking up, I saw water droplets dripping on the window, rain drifting outside the window, and I thought to myself, "Oh no! I have to endure another rainy day!"</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the rain gives me a really bad impression. Shanghai is originally a place of intense business, and most people are bustling and hurrying, racing in the field of profit every day, and they also have no leisurely mood to care about whether the weather is good or bad. But sunny days are always better than rainy days, and everyone should agree with this. Whether it's a poet in a small attic room bored to death, or an office worker in a writing room busy beyond description, on a sunny day there is always a chance to face the blue sky and the white clouds floating piece by piece, making sweet spring dreams. But rainy days are not like that. They give you only a feeling of stuffiness, turbidity, dampness, and helplessness. Everyone sighs with a bitter face at the gray and black sky. Whether indoors or on the street, it always makes you uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But this is only in Shanghai. In some places, rain is not particularly annoying. Like in the mountains of my hometown, rainy days are interesting beyond compare.</p>
<p>When I was a child, on such rainy days, I liked to stand on the second floor of the side building and gaze out. Below the building was a stream, its water somewhat turbid, flowing swiftly, spraying white foam on the sandy rocks. Opposite was the mountain, with clouds often spitting out from between the peaks, each with a different color and shape. The distant mountains were shrouded in mist. The rain hung before my eyes like a gauze curtain. Cobwebs were stretched on the old corners of the house, and many sparkling water droplets were entangled on the webs. Ducks in the pond were bending their necks, preening their feathers, and quacking loudly and happily. My sisters were weaving ribbons or embroidering downstairs, and my mother was spinning yarn in the outer room. The sound of the spinning wheel corresponded to the sound of the rain in front of the steps. My body was soaked by the rain. One moment I was nibbling on New Year cake, and the next I was clinging to my mother, arguing for this and wanting that. My mother always smiled gently. The same rainy day, but how happy, how memorable!</p>
<p>Three years ago, while living in Tokyo, it was also such a rainy day. I sat on the tatami mat, leaning against the brazier. The small four-and-a-half-mat room was full of exotic atmosphere. I quietly listened to the sound of the rain hitting the lead roof, and unconsciously felt the homesickness and travel sorrows common to wanderers. Just as I was about to feel extremely desolate, a burst of singing suddenly came from over there, melodious and beautiful. This was the most popular folk song in the island country, "The Girl of the Red Roof!" The same rainy day, but how beautiful, how poetic!</p>
<p>Now everything is over, everything has become an elusive trace of the past. I can no longer see the beautiful scenery of my hometown, nor can I hear the love songs of a foreign land. I am only lurking in a dark corner of this ugly metropolis, listening to the continuous spring rain, relentlessly, stubbornly dripping, dripping, making people feel depressed, irritable, and endlessly sentimental!</p>
<h3>Hometown Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>3. My Home and Miss Ling's Home</p>
<p>Around ten o'clock, we took the train to Cixi. This strange city of fish and salt was thrown behind us. The train carriages there were much smaller and slower than the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo lines, but we only sat for fifteen minutes before we arrived at Cixi. I almost laughed again; I felt like I was playing the protagonist in a slapstick movie, thinking that we would have to sit for at least two or three hours, but who knew that we would arrive after smoking a cigarette. Leaving the train station, we stepped out of the twentieth century. That long, narrow stone road stretched out in front of us, and a sedan chair floated above it, moving towards the mountain shadows, as if walking into a medieval ancient dream.</p>
<p>The station was still seven miles away from our house, the courtyard that had been locked up for eight years. The villagers were probably waiting for us at the gate to have lunch. The calla lilies must have bloomed, because the fields were already full of yellow rapeseed flowers, and the cuckoo's call was rippling in the spring breeze.</p>
<p>We walked quickly, and slowly, the white courtyard wall of our house stood out among the rapeseed flowers, and the green moss in the pond in front of the gate faintly reflected the bronze-colored sunlight.</p>
<p>"We're home! This time, we're really home!"</p>
<p>The three of us brothers broke into a run, no longer caring about our old uncle who was watching the scenery behind us. As we ran, the white courtyard wall became clearer, and the people sitting on the bridge over the small river in front of the gate could be seen clearly! Our home was there. Our home was there!</p>
<p>Running to the gate, suddenly several dogs rushed out barking at us. The people inside the house were scolding the dogs while looking at us, as if they didn't recognize us. After a while, they smiled and pointed at us, saying, "This is so-and-so's son, that is so-and-so's son." We didn't care about anything and rushed straight in. When we got to the house, our aunts and uncles had already arrived three days before us and were preparing tea and water to wait for us. I didn't even wash my face before running to the flower hall. The orange tree was blooming even more luxuriantly than before, and a large bodhi tree in the courtyard had grown taller than the house. The calla lilies wrapped around my feet. They still recognized me, because they smiled happily. I stood there silently, and my childhood memories came back to me one by one. I had listened to my grandmother telling stories under this bodhi tree, I had secretly stolen sugarcane to eat in that small room over there, and I had ridden that big dog called A'huang in this courtyard, thinking that I was riding through the streets after being selected as the third scholar. Now I am a twenty-two-year-old young man, but my grandmother is dead, A'huang is also dead, and the pillars of the house seem to be older than before. Memories will come back, but reality will not come back again.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we went to an aunt's house. There were seven of us in total, walking and laughing in the fields. My aunt's family was a large family in Ningbo, which was also Miss Ling's home. I had been there once when I was a child, but I didn't have much of an impression. This time, I was able to run there again, and I didn't think the crowding on the boat that night was anything. The house was really scary big. From entering the gate to my aunt's house, we walked through that dark corridor for half a day. I seemed to recognize all those houses, because the girl grew up here. As I went, I looked around; I wanted to know which room was where Miss Ling grew up. There was no one in those courtyards and houses, desolate, locked with the coolness of late autumn. Turning a corner, we walked into my aunt's house, and she had already seen us and came out smiling with her granddaughter in her arms. I hadn't seen her for almost three years. After Miss Ling died, I hadn't been to her house.</p>
<p>They talked for a while and then started playing cards. I sat alone by the window, holding her granddaughter and playing. She was a very cute girl. She was very happy to be with me, but she was also shy, with that kind of true and false appearance, so much like Miss Ling! The child was also four years old. Yes, Miss Ling had been dead for three years. She was now lying quietly under the marble in the International Cemetery. My aunt saw that I was having fun playing with her and said with a smile, "You really like her." I really like her, because she also has the lilac's flavor of remembrance!</p>
<p>I don't know what time it started, but it was drizzling outside the window, fine and light. In the dim sound of rain, the sky darkened. Facing this dim lamplight, I felt every raindrop dripping on my heart, and every drop of rain evoked old memories and old melancholy in my heart.</p>
<p>I was at Miss Ling's house; where was Miss Ling? Where was Miss Ling? Lilac's flavor of remembrance!</p>
<p>I stiffened my face and started playing with dolls with the child again.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Era and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Just walk around the entrance of the alley to see if Old Cao is back."</p>
<p>"What if Old Cao doesn't come back tonight?"</p>
<p>":::::"</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, you really are a well-behaved and proper young man." She seemed to be mocking him.</p>
<p>"::: I can't be a hypocrite like Mr. Lin. :::"</p>
<p>":::::"</p>
<p>Haiquan saw Qiuying lift her upper body, smiling as she stared at him. He felt an immense pressure and raised his head. He had already made up his mind considerably, fearing it was too late and not enough time. He wondered if Cao Shiguang should be back.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Although he asked her that, he felt a wave of chills running through his body. It was late at night, and the weather was indeed getting colder. His teeth chattered and clacked together. He could hardly form words.</p>
<p>"Me? :::" She yawned and buried her face in her hands. "I just want to dance in the sky. At any time, I want to dance while looking down to see how many pleasing men there are. If they are pleasing to me, I will definitely kick them, and after that, I will dance on these men's heads. Ah Cao is just one standing in the center of these many men. :::" Haiquan thought, how absurd her words were. So she wanted to kick herself in the head. Only now did he realize he was standing before an abyss. He wanted to retort with some words, but his upper and lower rows of teeth were clashing fiercely, and he couldn't say anything no matter what.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, do you feel cold? Don't just stand there, come sit in here. It's warmer in the quilt. :::"</p>
<p>As she spoke, she moved her jaw slightly, indicating that he should sit across from her, on the other side of the bed.</p>
<p>But in just a moment, he couldn't help but pounce on her again. Just as he kissed her cold, wet lips, he suddenly heard someone hammering on the door below, and hammering extremely violently.</p>
<p>They were both stunned.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, would you go down and take a look?"</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>America Abandons the Gold Standard</p>
<p>The Gold Market Experiences a Major Plunge</p>
<p>America Reinstates the Gold Ban, Silver Prices Rise Astonishingly</p>
<p>Negative News Abounds, Buyers Rarely Seen</p>
<p>Lowest at 966 Yuan, a Sharp Drop of 84.7 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market has been full of twists and turns. Yesterday, the market experienced another major plunge. In the early morning, due to foreign telegrams indicating that London's near and distant futures both increased by 4.375, and Bank of America rose by 3.5 points, the British-American and American-British exchange rates rose by as much as 13.5 and 19.5 points respectively. The spot silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 3 points, which was truly an unprecedented change. American cotton rose by 41 points, and the gold market immediately fell, because the United States had reinstated the gold ban. The opening price was 1,000 yuan, but there were few transactions. Shunlifuchang both accepted orders and once raised the price to over 1,010 yuan. Bingxing Yiyu sold, leading to a decline. Hengyu Dadecheng Laijin hovered around 10 yuan.

The exchange market also opened firm, but initially, there was still some struggle, so it once rebounded from 990 yuan to 1,005 yuan. Afterwards, it immediately trended downward. Foreign telegrams stated that U.S. President Roosevelt declared a ban on gold exports as a way to raise prices and that monetary expansion and the use of silver to pay war debts would be implemented. This triggered a plunge. The after-market opened relatively flat, but later, the exchange market loosened remarkably. Bombay rose by 1 rupee and 6 annas. Foreign telegrams also reported that the United States was planning to purchase a large number of silver ounces, and people's confidence weakened further. For a time, selling pressure was very strong, and prices fell rapidly, once dropping to 966 yuan (breaking the 700 tael mark, equivalent to 690.69 silver). Then it leveled off slightly, and the closing price was 971.5 yuan. It was observed that the environment was unfavorable throughout the day, and sellers outnumbered buyers, marking an unprecedented plunge since the abolition of taels and the introduction of the yuan. The future is indeed more ominous than auspicious. Early red count was at an additional 28 yuan, four-five point swap rate short sellers offered 7.5 yuan, May-June 14 yuan, April-June 20 yuan 5 jiao.

Maijia Li bought American dollars for August at 23 yuan, and Yuansheng Yong Zhaofeng Chang came to buy enthusiastically, pushing the price to 0.05 yuan. Hengxing continued to sell, to 1 yuan smooth. Goods were then sold, pulling up to 4.5 yuan. American dollars for August can be settled at 3 yuan. Hengyu then sold to 1 yuan.

Fuyu Yuanmao Yong went to 7.9 jiao. Xingye came out for July at 3 yuan, Shunli Yuankang Xiang sold to 3.5 yuan, and Yuanchun then bought, gradually rising, because the exchange market was slightly flat. By the time American dollars for July at 9375 were difficult to settle, Yuankang Xiang Hengyu Xiangfeng and others scrambled to buy, and the price rose to 0.02 yuan, hovering. Dadecheng Yuansheng Yong Fuyu sold, falling to within 95 yuan.

Mitsui and others bought American dollars for August at 1875, Hengyu Wanxing accepted orders, pulling to 5 yuan. Dadecheng came up to sell, so the noon close was 993.5 yuan.

The exchange market was remarkably firm, and there was news from foreign telegrams that the United States had purchased silver, Shenkang took the field to sell, Yuansheng Yong also sold, and the buyers in the field were weak, and the gold price fell rapidly. Banks had no appetite at all, and people's hearts were greatly weakened.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Rebound and Trend Higher</p>
<p>Guangdong Gang Covers Shorts, Retail Investors and Guest Gangs All Act</p>
<p>Unanimous Rebound of Half a Yuan to 1.1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the public bond market unexpectedly rebounded. The situation was unchanged, and the danger in Tianjin may not materialize. The Guangdong Gang suddenly covered shorts, and retail investors and guest gangs all began to act, causing the price to surge. At the opening in the morning, there was a rush in the market, and all bonds rebounded by 1 yuan. Among them, the 19 customs bond rose the most, by 1.23 yuan. The financial sector also slightly bought in, and buying on the 20th was especially high. In the second session, the upward momentum remained strong, and the various bonds listed above, such as the 19 customs bond, rose another 5 jiao. Afterwards, there were sell-offs from the 20th bond, starting with the 50th bond, so they fell back 3 to 5 jiao, and the trend appeared chaotic again. At the afternoon opening, short sellers again exerted pressure, and the 11th and 35th bonds continued to sell off sharply, and the market price turned downward again. The 19 customs bond even fell back as much as 8 or 9 jiao, and it seemed that there was no sign of turning back. Afterwards, the downward trend of the unified salt tax bonds slowed down, and the 20th bond still had buying interest, and people's hearts stabilized. By the time of the closing, it was already 6 o'clock, and the news was not bad, and it trended up another 5 or 6 jiao. As a result, it unanimously rebounded by half a yuan to 1.1 yuan. Pressing on the current continuous squeeze on the long and the short was expected. If Tianjin does not change, it may still trend higher. The total volume of transactions was 12,457,000 yuan, of which 12,000 yuan was in spot goods, and the futures unified salt tax bonds only accounted for over 3.9 million, the downsizing bonds accounted for 2.47 million, the 19 customs bonds accounted for over 2.7 million, the 20th volume and 20th customs bonds accounted for over 2.6 million, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 300,000 or 400,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Soar</h3>

Stocks soared, rising by 1 yuan to 11 yuan compared to the previous day. Wheat once soared to a peak of 7 jiao, the long silver reached 3 jiao 2 fen 375, and the U.S. dollar also fell severely, once being worth only 9 jiao 2 fen in foreign currency. According to the Steel Century magazine, this week's steel production reached 23%, a new high for this year, because the automobile industry has greatly expanded and orders from all parties have increased. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left (in yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Benchmark Yarn and Cotton Quickly Return Higher</p>
<p>Rumor Has It That the Factories Have Considerable Maintenance Measures</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending higher, and the situation has become firmer, because its manufacturers have slightly settled in 2,000 bales of yarn that had been previously sold off. As a result, people's hearts in the market were greatly excited, and rumors flew. It was said that the factories had considerable maintenance measures, so buying interest was strong, and the market disk surged. However, the current yarn sales are still clear. All parties are considering the fundamental problem from the perspective of actual needs, given the economic difficulties and weak purchasing power.</p>
<p>Benchmark Rises by More Than 2 Yuan</p>
<p>In the previous market, the opening of the benchmark market was still calm, but large households bought in, and the price of each month rose by 5 or 6 jiao. The price fell again in the second session, and the closing price rebounded, resulting in a rise of 1 yuan 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 jiao for each month. In the afternoon, there were still many retail investors who made up for their positions, and the situation was more bullish. The price of each month rose by 1.2 jiao to 8 jiao. The total volume of transactions for the day was 70,400 bales. It was found that Da Feng sold 1,700 bales, Ren Feng 1,600 bales, Yuan Tai 1,050 bales, Chang Feng 2,050 bales, De Ji 1,200 bales, Geng Feng 1,500 bales, and Yi Chang 1,600 bales.

<p>Weihaiwei 25 Sichuan 50 Luzhou 20</p>
<p>Guangdong 215 Shantou 40 Yunnan 40</p>
<p>The cotton market fell sharply in the early morning. Although American cotton rose, the gold price fell sharply, and the silver price rose sharply, so people's hearts were discouraged, and the selling pressure was still strong. Later, as the yarn market trended higher, the scattered short positions were excited to make up for their positions, and the market disk rebounded. In the afternoon, there were even speculators buying in large quantities, and the market sentiment was firm again, but there was still no sign of actual demand being activated.</p>

<h3>US Cotton Surges by Over Forty Points</h3>
<p>Increased Buying: Bullish Closing</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Overseas Silk Prices Soar</p>
<p>丨Up 13% From the Previous Day丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, raw silk prices on the New York Stock Exchange surged along with other commodities, opening at a high of $1.45 this month, up 13% from the 18th. Yokohama spot prices opened at 815 yuan yesterday, also up 8%. In the local market, due to the 6% drop in the US dollar, exporters who sent silk telegrams the day before had to buy back at a loss when the telegrams were converted yesterday. If the upward trend in the US stabilizes, Chinese silk will likely rise. However, the increase in US prices is solely due to the US government's reaffirmation of the ban on gold exports and the possibility of currency inflation. It is questionable whether lowering the US dollar price is beneficial for the US, which has a trade surplus. If the American people push up prices too aggressively, the eventual backlash may be severe. Therefore, continued price increases in silk in the near term are expected, but whether it will last is uncertain.</p>
<p>Local trading was very active. Shing Fuh Transportation imported 11.3 dan of Double Crane silk at 860 yuan. Jen Kee imported 16.18 dan of Golden Bull silk at 700 yuan. Five Star imported 13.15 dan of Gold Double Factory silk at 830 yuan. Also, 13.15 dan of Xishan silk were traded at 780 yuan. A total of 110 dan of Shandong Yellow Factory silk were traded at 650 yuan, with Jardine Matheson importing 40 pieces, Reiss &amp; Co. 50 pieces, and Daching 20 pieces. A total of 80 pieces of Sichuan Yellow Factory silk with 20.22 stripes were traded, with Reiss &amp; Co. importing 50 pieces and Jardine Matheson 30 pieces, both at 670 yuan. Additionally, 30 pieces of 3K Brand Yellow Factory silk with 13.15 stripes were traded, with Reiss &amp; Co. importing 20 pieces and Shing Fuh 10 pieces, at 657 yuan. The total trading volume in the city was around 300 dan.</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The River Market Remains Stable</p>
<p>丨Yin Yuan Drops Two Jiao丨</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, 30 to 40 boats arrived. The market situation stabilized, but Yin Yuan fell drastically by two jiao due to previous excessive buying. As for Su Tong Jing and Nan Gang thick rice, although there were occasional buyers, the volume was small and the market price remained stable. High-quality rice was slightly scarce. Most of the thin rice was bought for delivery, especially by the Northern Alliance. The Southern Alliance remained inactive. Buyers from Tangshan, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, etc., took 1700 to 1800 bags, mainly Qing Jiao, Songjiang, Si Jing, and Xi Lian rice. However, the buyer demand was strict, and sellers were willing to lower prices due to ample supply, leading to a stable market with little fluctuation. Du Yang Jian and various other varieties remained stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 18 to 19 boats arrived from various River Alliance. Bai Jing sales were normal, and the market showed signs of fatigue. There was little arrival and digestion of thin rice, and the price remained firm. Early rice and Xian rice remained stable. There was little Yin Bai Yuan rice arriving, and sales were acceptable, so the price remained tight.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchants Experiment with Hunan Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer Xian and customer Hua rice continued to be active, but the volume was slightly less than the previous day because the Fujian Alliance planned to reduce purchases. Over 1,500 bags were opened for sale in the market. High-quality rice remained firm, while mid- and low-quality rice were slightly flat. Besides the Fujian Alliance, local merchants also inquired. Furthermore, Tianjin merchants arrived in the market to experiment with 100 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice, priced at 7 yuan and 9.5 jiao. If this batch sells well in Tianjin, then subsequent transactions should continue. Therefore, although sales of Fujian Hua rice were slow yesterday, people's hopes were high, because besides the Fujian Alliance, there was the hope of continued purchases from Tianjin and local merchants. The local merchants sold 150 bags of South Red rice at 6 yuan and 7.9 jiao. The Fujian Alliance sold 245 bags of Hunan Shan rice at 7 yuan and 2.5 jiao, and 170 bags of rough oil rice at 7 yuan and 5 jiao. A total of over 800 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were sold at 7 yuan and 9.5 jiao to 7 yuan and 5 jiao, which were divided between the Fujian Alliance and local merchants.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Rebound Slightly by One or Two Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a slight stabilization in the morning. As foreign wheat quotations suddenly improved by 7 or 8 jiao, external market sentiment was active. Although buying interest was not smooth, market prices gradually rose. Near-term contracts were flat in various trades, while far-term contracts improved by 5 li to 1 fen. When trading opened in the afternoon, the market price of this month's contracts also gradually rose due to the arrival of small factory goods. Due to limited factory supply, external sentiment remained positive for far-term contracts, and the opening price improved again. This increase seemed to be entirely driven by foreign wheat quotations, as actual sales had not yet improved. Furthermore, gold prices plummeted by 70 to 80 yuan. There is no doubt that foreign exchange rates will rise in the future. Therefore, the sale of foreign wheat will certainly take advantage of this opportunity, and orders will continue to flow in. As a result, this month's contracts rose by 1 fen compared to the previous day, May contracts rose by 5 li, June contracts rose by 1 fen, July contracts rose by 1.5 fen, August contracts rose by 1.75 fen, and September contracts rose by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Many Changes in the Future of Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures generally showed a revolving trend. Although foreign wheat quotations rose by a huge 7 or 8 jiao, there were very few buyers. The purchasing power of inland merchants has disappeared. Local factories already have direct orders for foreign wheat to meet their standard needs, so they do not pay attention. Therefore, buying interest in various trades has not yet increased. Furthermore, Argentine foreign wheat is still priced at only 3.25 yuan, and gold prices are plummeting. The future is likely to undergo many changes. As a result, this month's contracts were unchanged from the previous day, May and June contracts were not opened, July contracts fell by 1 fen, August contracts improved by 1 fen, and September contracts improved by 4 fen compared to Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Lead Prices Soar</p>
<p>The incoming price of lead soared by 2.75 gold yuan yesterday, requiring 41.5 gold yuan per ton. It is said that the price increase was caused by the soaring price of tin. However, the local US exchange rate suddenly rose yesterday, and the market price remained largely unchanged. The current price is still 16.4 yuan per dan. Besides tea merchants, no other merchants were interested in buying.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Talking About Good Goods</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Mentioning the words "good goods" seems a bit unseemly, because "good goods" inevitably implies being driven by greed. Therefore, righteous gentlemen never lightly utter them, even though in their hearts, there is an indescribable joy. If righteous gentlemen feel this way, then those who dare not call themselves righteous gentlemen need not be mentioned. That's why murder and robbery are rampant, stemming from this very principle.</p>
<p>In reality, in today's orderly society, there's no need to shy away from the matter of "good goods." Promotion and wealth are pursued for "good goods," seizing cities and plundering lands are for "good goods," applying thick layers of snow cream on one's face while flirting with the concubines of powerful officials is also for "good goods." Even those who loudly advocate "national goods to save the country" while tapping on their abacuses are primarily after "good goods."</p>
<p>Clearly, anyone who doesn't pursue "good goods" cannot survive in realistic society, because the Gentleman's Kingdom in "Flowers in the Mirror" is merely a writer's fantasy. Moreover, "morality" and "courtesy" are no longer intoxicating opium.</p>
<p>Therefore, the pursuit of "good goods" is now being refined and perfected. The only missing piece is that everyone is still unwilling to express it directly and frankly.</p>
<p>Take recent events, for example. Before the departure of the Central officials for their overseas trip, Committee Member Zhang "abused his power to sell" the naval hospital and conveniently took away the ancient calligraphy and paintings from the Summer Palace. This is perfectly clear: it's for "good goods." The sale of the naval hospital undoubtedly brought in considerable revenue, and the antique calligraphy and paintings naturally fetch a high price. However, Committee Member Zhang is still young after all, and his actions are not very reliable. For instance, the "selling" issue only revolved around "abusing his power." If he could have agreed on the division of spoils beforehand without "abusing his power," then this secret wouldn't have reached the ears of us ordinary folks. Secondly, taking a few items as souvenirs is customary in Chinese officialdom. However, he did so while people were emphasizing saving the country with antiques and turning the Shanghai concessions into a safe deposit box, and he refused to consult with the custodians. Naturally, people would demand their detention. Of course, this is just a round of finger-pointing and barking at the loser, while in reality, they remain extremely polite and respectful to our Committee Member Zhang. After all, they are all from the same family, so it's easy to talk. But this has somewhat increased the evidence that he's overly fond of "good goods."</p>
<p>Secondly, there are also those who only care about "good goods" regardless of everything else. The most obvious example is General Tang Yulin, who is once again a military governor. Cultivating poppies and hiring Japanese technicians to establish a morphine factory are, of course, for "good goods." Later, because "resolving to resist Japan" would ensure ample support, and two million in war bonds could be obtained with just one "expression" of intent, he immediately "resolved to resist Japan" without hesitation. Subsequently, when Chengde was in danger and the Japanese made their move, he had no choice but to pack his valuables and flee overnight to protect his own life and property. Furthermore, after careful inquiries, the income of the "national heroes" was not bad after all, so he has now decided to "prepare for a counterattack," seeking merit to redeem his crimes and asking the central government for titles. Of course, the central officials are all generous and magnanimous, so they'll grant him the title of military governor and give him another opportunity to make money. In this light, General Yang Yulin is merely a military man who has done little to cultivate himself, and his pursuit of "good goods" is too blatant.</p>
<p>However, all things considered, the continuation of such national crises is indeed a good year for those who love "good goods." Although many people reluctantly bought an "aviation save the country" badge, many lords and masters have seized this opportunity to fulfill their desires for "good goods." Alas, this is what is called "national crisis."</p>

<h3>Song of the Public Servant</h3>
<p>— Zhu Maoti</p>
<p>Democracy emphasizes equality, servitude has long been banned, so why do officials call themselves servants? They call themselves servants.</p>
<p>Servant is said to be public, civilized people have no patience. I am a master, want to study why.</p>
<p>“How to admire the servant of the Huo family, teasing as a furnace prostitute; or seeking a partner, hoping to match Kang Cheng’s maid.</p>
<p>Willing to be called lowly, not know why. The world heard me, chuckle not stop.</p>
<p>"This dull head, thinking is very corrupt! The political system has been reformed, is today servant the same as the past?</p>
<p>A little bit of love for silk, offensive to small joy. Seeking its greatest desire; it is here not there.</p>
<p>Power enough to abuse subordinates; the power to hold the Emperor. Bribery is public, the door as a market!</p>
<p>Those who chase and drill, licking pus and hemorrhoids; called to make servants, actually made servants.”</p>
<p>I then surprise, overthrow to this extent? "Alas hundreds of millions, it is the heart first die!</p>
<p>Carriers and slaves, dare to mess up the order. Family lost servant cheat master. Ancient to now for long!</p>
<p>XX Note: Today no Emperor, borrowed to metaphor prestige. Power also is big.</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>— Shoupu</p>
<p>Spring is here, bringing joy to the world. Faint sunshine, soft wind, filled with warm love. All sentient beings - people, birds, flowers, are frolicking in this intoxicating spring breeze. Everyone feels that the seasons have changed.</p>
<p>But the joy has been taken away, leaving me only desolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>In a short life, everyone has counted more than twenty springs, but none have left a lovely memory. The days have all passed as if in a dream. Spring has been wasted on me.</p>
<p>Early years, in the mother's embrace, should be happy? But at that time, because the mother was sick, it is said that I ate very little milk. I am afraid that crying was inevitable. But wailing is better than sobbing. I finally grew up happily under the protection of my parents, and to this day I can't find even a trace of sadness left over from that time. What about later? I followed the days in a daze, all the way to the present. In the past many days. If you squeeze it out, you may still find some faint shadows, but they are too faint, and a closer look reveals a blur.</p>
<p>I remember it was that spring, Yi wrote a letter saying that we could meet in S after the Lantern Festival. At that time, I really wanted to arrange a good spring, but it was shattered by his illness and ninety days of spring. By the time he recovered, the longed-for cherry blossoms had withered. We faced each other in vain, and never thought about it again. Let the flowers bloom and wither, without leaving any traces. The change of seasons did not cause me any feelings, but I felt colder when the winter wind blew. Now, I have been drifting north and south for four or five years. The old love is like yesterday, but the time is no longer the same. Let the dreamlike life pass by like a dream. Recalling it is futile.</p>
<p>Now, spring has come to the world again, and the spring breeze rekindles people's enthusiasm. All sentient beings are rejoicing, and green lightly floats on the treetops. But in the city, except for the spring breeze that blows everywhere, there is no other feature to be found. Coal cinder and asphalt roads will never grow a blade of grass. The trees standing on the side of the road also have the sickness of the city, not as majestic as those seen in the countryside. Alas, urban life is as gray as asphalt roads. At this time, I remotely imagine the fields of my beautiful hometown of western Zhejiang, which should already be covered with green. Taking advantage of this splendid spring, I bless Yi to understand a lot. The days are easy to disappear.</p>
<h3>China's Three Paths Forward</h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University and Chairman of the Tianjin Local Association, recently made his remarks to reporters. He said to reporters: "We have only three paths to take in this serious situation: first, direct negotiations; second, recovering lost territories; and third, resisting to the death. However, given the current dire international situation, even if the government wants to compromise and negotiate, the people will resolutely oppose it. As for recovering lost territories, we are not sufficiently prepared militarily or economically, so there is no way to talk about it. It is undeniable, therefore, that the only broad road is to fight to the death.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is, after all, an older person. He once said to his students: "I founded Nankai University, so I can do whatever I want. What can you do?" But now that the little Japanese have seized the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, and the passes along the Great Wall, the people of the whole country are planning to recover the lost territories to the death. Our Mr. Zhang, however, feels that we are not sufficiently prepared militarily or economically, so we can't do anything to the little Japanese and can only hope to make peace with them. It's a pity that the ignorant commoners are not knowledgeable and do not recognize the times, otherwise our clever</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Mr. Zhang would have already shouted out the slogan of "direct negotiations"! Now, because of the resolute opposition of the commoners, he has had to abandon this path and take the third path.</p>
<p>"Long-term resistance" and "resistance to the death" are shouted not only by military men, but also by men of letters. The reason is that this path of "resistance to the death" is in line with the Doctrine of the Mean. Since we can't do anything to the little Japanese, and we don't dare to negotiate directly with Japan because of the resolute opposition of the commoners, we are caught in a dilemma between fearing Japan externally and fearing the people internally. In this difficult situation, we can only choose the Doctrine of the Mean and deal with it! Therefore, "resistance to the death," "long-term resistance," and "negotiating while resisting" are the only broad paths!</p>
<p>Let's give the three northeastern provinces and Rehe to the Japanese for the time being, and resist when the little Japanese reach the Great Wall passes. In the event that the little Japanese break through the Great Wall, it would be best to abandon Beiping and Tianjin first, because the terrain of Beiping and Tianjin is flat and there are no natural defenses,</p>
<p>And everywhere there is the risk of being surrounded by the enemy, so abandoning Beiping and Tianjin is not a defeat, but a strategic decision to retreat to the second line of defense in preparation for resistance!</p>
<p>When the little Japanese break into Beiping and Tianjin, we can retreat to the old lands of Feng and Hao and resist again. If we can't hold Feng and Hao, and the little Japanese continue to press on, we can retreat into the Yumen Pass and defend it in preparation for resistance. In short, we will resist wherever the Japanese attack. This is the true meaning of long-term resistance, and this is a moderate approach that takes everything into account. I cannot help but admire Mr. Zhang's wonderful and brilliant views.</p>
<h3>The Art of Advertising</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Many people have discussed the art of navigating the world, but it's often just a nonsensical jumble. In reality, these notions are merely theories; you must apply a formula to turn them into practice, which is the true art of navigating the world. Otherwise, showing off too much can lead to unexpected dangers. Flattery can backfire, and boasting about your abilities can reveal your shortcomings even before you get drunk. The art lies in mastering (A+B)² = A² + 2AB + B² and then applying the formula to (2+3)² = 2² + 2*3 + 3². Only then can you truly grasp the essence of art. The same applies to advertising!</p>
<p>For example, if your establishment is a silk shop, and you notice a competitor thriving by deceptively promoting their products, you might pound your chest and declare, "I guarantee with my integrity that they sell Japanese goods! Our shop only sells genuine domestic products at affordable prices. Since we opened, we've been honest with everyone, young and old. Patriotic individuals who want to buy domestic products, come to us!" But even if you shout yourself hoarse, you won't see any customers. This is because you know the art of advertising but don't know how to apply its formula. How does one apply the formula of art?</p>
<p>Run a large advertisement on the front page of newspapers, stating that your shop has a mountain of inventory and is disregarding costs for a one-week clearance sale. (After one week, you can run another advertisement, claiming that due to popular demand, you are reluctantly extending the sale for another week, emphasizing that this is a rare opportunity not to be missed.) Offer discounts of 91% and give away free gifts. Additionally, hold a one-hour flash sale every day at 9:30 AM, selling woolen cheongsam fabric for one yuan per piece, limited to 1,000 pieces. Offer worsted wool fabric for two yuan per piece, limited to 500 pieces, and add extra fabric to every purchase. This will guarantee that you have to close the iron gates and your staff will be overwhelmed serving customers. You can clear out all your unsold old stock, and fill your pockets. Why not? However, I must state in advance that the 1,000 pieces of woolen cheongsam fabric and 500 pieces of worsted wool fabric don't necessarily have to be real. Even if you have ten pieces, five pieces, or even none, it's fine. It's just a formula of art. If you don't believe me, here's an example of an advertisement:</p>
<p>Isn't dancing all the rage these days? You're sensual, alluring, captivating souls. Friends who crave eroticism are unsure which establishment to choose. So, an advertisement well-versed in the art formula reads: "Researching artistic beauty dancing, overthrowing prostitution style singing and dancing, sensual beauty secret bathroom."</p>
<p>The bathroom is already mysterious enough, so there's no harm in making it a secret. "Overthrowing prostitution style" is a provocation tactic. Last night after 8 PM, I passed by the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower, and the iron gates of the establishment were closed, but the crowd of people outside stretched from the pedestrian walkway to the center of the road, with five tramcars slowly navigating through. Disappointed viewers will likely gather in front of the establishment again at 7 PM tonight.</p>
<p>If you understand this, you'll never go hungry. Advertising colleagues, why not come and openly observe, free of charge?</p>

<p>Partnership Dispute</p>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>In May of last year, I partnered with Mr. Yang to open a XX retail outlet. We agreed on a capital of six hundred yuan, each contributing half. If additional capital was needed later, we would each bear half the burden. Upon starting the business, we each paid two hundred yuan and began decorating, purchasing equipment, and starting operations. Subsequently, in June, we each contributed another one hundred yuan, and Mr. Yang signed a contract with the parent company and paid a deposit of two hundred yuan. However, since the opening, Mr. Yang has not concerned himself with the store's affairs, yet he draws a salary of ten yuan from the store each month. In mid-November, I discovered that the deposit supposedly paid by Mr. Yang had been diverted and not actually paid. As a result, the parent company deducted the commission due to our store to cover the deposit. Consequently, our store's finances were almost impossible to maintain, so I borrowed money to cover it. I have repeatedly tried to recover the funds, but he has consistently delayed. It has been a year now, and there is still no concrete indication of repayment. The partnership agreement has also been delayed and not yet finalized. I now urgently need to settle procedures with Mr. Yang, but I cannot think of a simple solution. Therefore, I respectfully request your advice. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Respectfully, Zang Xuehua</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: When someone suffers a loss, they should naturally seek ways to negotiate and recover what was lost. "Tolerance and generosity" may be words to live by, but in reality, no one wants to suffer a loss. However, while negotiation is necessary, there is something even more important: to immediately stop the loss from continuing. Because past losses are ultimately limited, but future losses are endless. As for negotiation tactics, the first step is to know yourself and your opponent and assess their abilities. The conditions proposed must be within the opponent's capacity to fulfill; otherwise, the request will be delayed because they are unable to accept it. Based on the above theory, "accepting the loss and settling" is truly the only way to negotiate. Therefore, we believe that Mr. Zang does not need to pursue Mr. Yang at this point, as it seems he may genuinely be unable to repay. You might as well let him withdraw his shares. The dry salary he previously received need not be investigated. He contributed three hundred yuan of capital and diverted two hundred yuan of deposit, so he still has one hundred yuan of capital. You might as well be straightforward and quick and return it to him. From then on, make a clean break, and you will take over the store. The dry salary can also be given out without any politeness. If you are strong enough after this, you might want to do it alone. Otherwise, find a proper person to work with you, and do away with your current neither-dead-nor-alive state!</p>
<h3>Market</h3>
<p>Publication of Hitler's New Book: "Hitler and the New Germany," recently published by the Liming Bookstore on Fourth Ma Road in this city, is not only novel in its subject matter and rich in content, but also employs a beautiful literary style to systematically narrate the bizarre and tortuous development of Hitler from a bricklayer to a key figure on the modern international political stage, making it quite thought-provoking. It also provides a detailed interpretation of the evolution of the National Socialist Party and its relationship with German politics, and the six illustrations are very valuable. It can be used as a reference for those studying German politics and international issues, and can also be read as a novel. It is truly a rare and excellent work.</p>

<h3>Time in Dreams (Serial 33)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(14) Father and Cold Shoulders</p>
<p>This evening, Wu Yi broke his routine and returned home after 7 PM. His wife, Mrs. Liu, and his two sons, Wu Yuan and Wu Meng, were already gathered in the dining room waiting for him.</p>
<p>"Dad! Where did you take Wang Guodong?" Wu Yuan's temperament was even more impatient than his father's. Wu Yi hadn't even sat down yet, and he was already impatiently demanding an answer. The tone of his voice was almost as stern as a police officer interrogating a petty thief about stolen goods. Mrs. Liu also found it very unnatural and thought Wu Yi would inevitably get angry. She quickly looked up at him with a conciliatory smile. Unexpectedly, he showed no reaction as if he hadn't heard anything. What was especially strange was that his thin, dark face was unexpectedly flushed with drink, unlike usual. This made Mrs. Liu uncontrollably panicked!</p>
<p>Indeed, Wu Yi had not been drinking today. He had set aside his drinking time to handle an urgent matter. At this moment, he felt satisfied and happy in his heart, but also paradoxically felt an indescribable emptiness, as if he had lost something priceless, leaving him confused and dazed.</p>
<p>"You're an hour later than usual." Mrs. Liu noticed his mental state from his sluggish movements and didn't dare abandon her responsibility as a wife. She gently walked over, helped him sit in a large wicker chair, and soothed him tenderly.</p>
<p>Wu Yi seemed as exhausted as if he had just returned from a long journey. Although he had entrusted his entire weight to the large wicker chair beneath him, he was still panting deeply. His original vigor seemed to have slipped away because he hadn't been drinking today.</p>
<p>The younger son quickly poured him a cup of tea, and the elder son had no choice but to tolerate his father's silence for the time being, not daring to ask any further questions.</p>
<p>"Suzhen, the things happening at school, I think Yuan'er has already told you!" After resting for more than ten minutes, Wu Yi finally broke the silence and said solemnly to his wife, "Do you know who Wang Guodong is?"</p>
<p>"I don't know!" Mrs. Liu replied sincerely. Because Wu Yi had never told her about Xiao Lin entering X University, and he had never even mentioned that Wang Guodong was Xiao Lin, she naturally couldn't have guessed.</p>
<p>"He is Xiao Lin, Jufeng's child." Wu Yi explained the key point like the finishing touch on a painting. Although his two sons didn't understand the twists and turns, Mrs. Liu immediately understood when she heard this. She immediately knew why Wu Yi had been trying so hard to protect Wang Guodong today. But although she understood, she didn't feel unhappy or express dissatisfaction. Perhaps it was because she wasn't originally from Zhenjiang, so she had always been afraid of jealousy. When Wu Yi was constantly mixing with Jufeng in the past, she had never said a word of complaint. Now that Jufeng was dead and Wu Yi was just taking care of her child, there was naturally even less need to be jealous.</p>

<h3>Film Special</h3>
<h3>Joan Crawford, as Described by Norma Shearer</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford are both contract actors at MGM. Because they hold similar positions, some say they are intensely competitive behind the scenes. The main reason is that although Norma and Joan work for the same company, they rarely talk or hang out together. Outsiders suspect they harbor secret resentment due to their estrangement, but Norma has now stated that she and Joan have no desire to compete for status whatsoever. Norma is a person of impeccable conduct and an open mind, so what she says is certainly not a false pretense.</p>
<p>Norma said, "Although Joan Crawford and I are both at MGM, my time is very limited. Everything at home has to be settled first, and only the remaining time is for my work. Joan and I are different. She is diligent in her work, and her household affairs are managed by others. Moreover, she has no children and can focus on the set. So, my working hours are often at home, while Joan works all day on the set and has very little free time. Therefore, we rarely have a day to chat freely, but our relationship is absolutely fine. It's just that we spend little time together, so it's no wonder outsiders suspect we are competing for fame and fortune."</p>
<p>"Joan Crawford is the friend I consider the most perfect. Her amiability and loyalty are praised by everyone in Hollywood. She has never had a problem with anyone. Although I don't see or talk to her every day, I know her personality completely. And I don't know how to be jealous or resentful of others. Moreover, I don't have that much energy to spend on scheming. Who's more artistically accomplished, Joan or me, that has to be evaluated fairly by the public and by the camera. Does competing necessarily make someone better? I don't think Joan has that intention at all, and I know I'm not capable of that kind of scheming. I consider Joan and I to be good friends, and Joan wouldn't dislike me and abandon me."</p>
<p>"In terms of superficial fame, although I have been hailed as the Queen of MGM, it's just an empty title. I really work too little. Since 'Smilin' Through' was completed last year, I've only filmed one movie, 'Smiling Through.' I still try my best to conserve time and squeeze out time by having Charles manage many household affairs. As for Joan's works, after 'Grand Hotel,' there were 'Rain,' 'Today We Live,' and the recent 'Turnabout.' Although 'Rain' was filmed by Fox, borrowing Joan, it is also a glory for MGM. So, I recognize that I am not as good as Joan. I know that she is more diligent than me. I respect her, and I am not jealous of her. I especially respect her treatment of people, and she doesn't act like a red star or treat people with arrogance."</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "State Fair"</h3>
<p>— Wanshi</p>
<p>Obviously, the overall economic panic does not exclude the film industry. Therefore, American film producers have to rely on "stars" to make extreme appeals. Although they are all originally able to stand on their own and individually become the protagonists of various films, under the current wave of economic collapse, they have to lower themselves a little and act in a film with many "stars."</p>
<p>First, there was MGM's "Grand Hotel," and now there is Fox's "State Fair."</p>
<p>Because there are so many "stars" in this film, and it is inconvenient to demote anyone to a supporting role, the screenwriter has to create a script that can accommodate many protagonists in order to suit this special condition. Regarding this point, I think some people might say, "This film has no protagonist." If that is the case, then I believe he has definitely ignored the main reason why Fox wanted to film this film.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, since there are so many protagonists in this film, then director Henry King must pay attention to each star separately, and it is best to be very balanced. Therefore, in order to be thorough, the director must take all three aspects into consideration in the depiction of the State Fair, and at the same time, editing will inevitably be a little troublesome. Because this play is performed in the form of comedy, it does not need to be too serious in tone, so the director must make the whole play very lively, and even insert extremely natural jokes at any time. However, his depiction of the love between the two pairs of men and women does not seem very lively. The main thing is that the same scenes are too many, such as the reporter and Margie hugging in the car, but it is repeated more than three times. However, the love talks on the hill are different in content each time, so they are of course more tasteful. Others, such as Margie being overjoyed and losing herself on the reporter's shoulder, and Wayne and Emily's warm night, only the voices are heard, but no people are seen. The picture uses the spring breeze blowing the curtains to enhance the tender mood. It is indeed very beautiful and vivid.</p>
<p>Regarding performance, I don't want to say too much. Anyway, each star has his inherent achievements. The lighting is most worthy of attention. They are all so quiet and soft.</p>
<p>As for the meaning of this film, then the consistent satire throughout is not to be ignored. The elderly couple's desire for fame and wealth, the merchants' exaggerated shouts, the judges' ugly states, Wayne's reluctantly taking up with an old flame after a broken heart, and the most severe is actually using the lust of a pig to illustrate the passion of young men and women.</p>
<p>A lightly sketched work like this can actually achieve such great success, of course we have to admit that this is a relatively special harvest in American films. But we also fully understand the producer's hard work.</p>
<h3>Review of "Her Heart"</h3>
<p>— Ailian</p>
<p>"Her Heart" is such a poetic name! But for this film, this title is too broad and impractical. Judging from the position, capital, and other aspects of Yueming Company, this film is not only much better than "The Great Hero of Guandong" and "Female Escort," but even the recently released "The Real Man" is not as good as this one. This shows that it is at a stage of gradual progress.</p>
<p>In the productions of small companies, the story is always very long. Indeed, a long story can save the director a lot of effort. The plot is like this:</p>
<p>A vain girl, her father is a school director. In a certain year, a talented and handsome young man graduated, and they fell in love. However, a secretary of the school director also has a crush on the girl, so a love triangle is formed. The secretary also uses the merits of the beauty contest to threaten the girl, and uses hooligans to forcibly kidnap the girl. At that time, the young man and the girl's cousin also used the police to capture them. The result is of course that the talented man and the beautiful woman become a couple.</p>
<p>This plot, although lacking in satire, is generally passable. The organization can also be graded.</p>
<p>The director is Ren Pengnian, the boss of Yueming. He is very unfamiliar with this kind of social drama, so mistakes are inevitable, the insertion is not good, and the editing cannot be called art.</p>
<p>The most important actor is the new star who plays that girl? Huo Feilun, she is very beautiful. This is her first time on camera. Although there are many overly pretentious places, the director should be responsible for this. She feels her personal talent is not bad, and the young man Luo Kebeng has made some progress in this film compared to "The Real Man," but the surface is still much worse. Only fighting is his forte. It is not necessary to talk about the other important roles, as they seem too civilized.</p>
<p>The photography is ordinary. The light is still sunlight. Although the subtitles repeatedly prompt that it is late at night, it does not look like a night scene at all. Some of the scenery is not bad, but some are so fake that it is obvious at a glance. There are not many subtitles, but the wording lacks research. The music provided by the Central Grand Theater is also extremely boring.</p>
<p>There are many inappropriate places in this drama, especially the costumes. For example, the rich man's nephew is dressed like a hooligan, while the hooligans are dressed in suits and leather shoes, with a graceful demeanor. There are more loopholes. For example, the big fight at the end is simply acting. When a bullet hits the face, in addition to a little black stain, there is no blood at all. The humorous insertions not only do not make people laugh, but also mistake the plot. In short, these are all counterproductive.</p>
<p>In the second half, it can be very tense, but the exterior scenes, such as running, etc.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, are filmed too much, which makes it feel lax.</p>
<p>In the end, I think this kind of happy ending is indeed welcomed by low-level tastes, and all the technology is only thought to be satisfactory by people with low-level ideas. Therefore, I hope that Yueming Company will continue to work hard to move forward.</p>
<h3>Warner Pyle and the White Elephant</h3>
<p>Hua·Ming·</p>
<p>When Warner Pyle was sixteen years old, he followed his father to work with the workers. His father was a laborer, and Warner found a job herding elephants. At that time, Warner only wanted to be an elephant herder for the rest of his life. He probably never dreamed of Hollywood!</p>
<p>Among the animals, the skin of the white elephant is the thickest. Other animals know pain even when whipped a few times, but it is not easy to tame a white elephant even if the whip is destroyed. Because of this, a person who herds white elephants absolutely cannot be competent without patience. When Warner first arrived at the ranch, the owner did not know his character and asked him to manage the white elephants. Warner grew up with the workers, so he naturally had some rough habits. The first few days were extremely difficult. Unexpectedly, Warner Pyle actually worked as an elephant herder for more than twenty years, training himself into a character who was able to endure and was cunning, resourceful, and sometimes very sincere. All of these are the basis for his ability to stand out in the film industry today and the strange style that no one can confront.</p>
<p>The big key to Warner's future was of course "Grand Hotel," but the reason why he was able to be on par with the top-notch stars of Hollywood, Greta Garbo, the Barrymore brothers, and Joan Crawford, all four big stars, was actually due to the success of "The Champ." Warner and Jackie Cooper were awarded by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1932 for "The Champ." At the same time, this film was the source of Warner Pyle's good fortune.</p>
<p>In "Grand Hotel," we got a deeper impression of Warner. His exploitation of the capitalist's sinister methods is exactly the transformation of his methods of dealing with white elephants. His cunning attitude is perfectly portrayed, as the newspapers have already concluded.</p>
<h3>Movies Showing in Taverns</h3>
<p>Ying·Dai·</p>
<p>Movie Fans Can Eat Roast Pork</p>
<p>Ever since the area of Jugoslav Nicodin began transporting roast pork to the Belgrade area, general movie fans began to have a special craving for fragrant roast pork.</p>
<p>But general movie fans, after eating roast pork, stopped going to movies in order to save money. As a result, movie theaters were empty, and those owners began to think of special ways to attract moviegoers.</p>
<p>One owner published a huge advertisement, saying that those who went to the movie theater to watch a movie would be given a free slice of roast pork without paying a penny.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, a tavern invented a countermeasure. He built a room in the tavern to show movies. Those who went to his tavern to eat roast pork could watch movies for free. As a result, the movie theater's business was completely stolen.</p>
<p>It is said that in that tavern, movies are shown in a dark room during the day, and in the garden at night if the weather is clear. This method is of course very novel. Since its implementation, business has been very good, and the sales of roast pork are especially amazing!</p>
<h3>Prelude to "Spring Tide"</h3>
<p>Zhou·Jing·Zhi·</p>
<p>After the news that "Spring Tide" will soon be released in Shanghai spread, my heart was filled with joy. "Spring Tide" is an immortal masterpiece by the great Russian writer Turgenev. Although it has now been adapted into a Chinese script, its core remains, and it is still so profound and moving. In addition, director Zheng Yingshi poured his heart and soul into it, making it a special force in domestic sound films.</p>
<p>The plot is: "A weak-willed young man abandons his lover due to erotic temptation, and then awakens to his past mistakes after suffering greatly. However, what methods can be used to compensate for the condemnation of conscience? A single slip can cause eternal regret!"</p>
<p>What is even more worthy of introduction is that the clarity of the sound on the film is the best recording ever, which was recorded by Yan Heming. I have unlimited hope for his future.</p>
<h3>Movie News Snippets</h3>
<p>Song · Ling ·</p>
<p>The film industry has initiated a joint film production to raise funds for a "Movie Plane." The preparatory committee met the other day at the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao and resolved that the script for the film should take the promotion of aviation to save the nation as its general theme, further divided into sub-items to showcase the reactions and efforts of all sectors regarding saving the nation through aviation. The sub-items are tentatively set as twelve categories: agriculture, industry, commerce, education, the performing arts, beggars, artists, children, the military, government, doctors, and lawyers. Each film company will be responsible for one or two items, and the filming will be divided among them. During screening, they will still be connected as a single, complete film.</p>
<p>Those in China who have researched sound films include Shi Shipan's "Aisitone," Yan Hemen's "Hemingtone," Zhu Qingxian's "Qingxian Style," and a certain university professor's "Shiduotong." Among them, those who have already filmed movies include Qingxian Style's "Spring Breeze Willow Branches" and Hemingtone's "Spring Tide." It is now heard that Zhu Qingxian's "Bringing Glory to the Nation," produced on behalf of Jinan Company, has also been completed, and its results are said to be an improvement over "Spring Breeze Willow Branches."</p>
<p>"Pursuit," directed by Qiu Qixiang and starring Li Minghui, recently opened at the Beijing Theater and is reportedly sold out every day. When the film premiered at Xinguang, the song "When Will We Meet Again," sung by Li Minghui in the first scene during a farewell gathering at a certain university, was later deemed too lengthy and the melody not very good, so it was re-filmed and replaced. The first scene now being shown in Beijing features Li Minghui singing "Winter Clothing Song."</p>
<h3>Westerners' Views on Films that Insult China</h3>
<p>Xin ·</p>
<p>The bad trend of Western films insulting Chinese people has become increasingly intense in recent years. All such films brought to China have been repeatedly banned from screening. It is evident how much this is criticized by the people of our country. However, various film companies still refuse to rein themselves in, and continue to produce such films, gradually damaging the feelings between the Chinese and American people, which worries knowledgeable people. The American film magazine published an article on March 18, representing the views of Jiao Lin Yanaide, the American Commercial Counselor stationed in Shanghai, on films that insult China. His words were righteous and direct, no less than a wake-up call to the entire American film industry. A translation of his words is specially recorded below:</p>
<p>"If American film companies could conduct accurate and reasonable investigations into Chinese customs, national conditions, and social organization when filming and performing movies about Chinese people, then the relationship between China and the United States and the interests of the United States in China would be further strengthened.</p>
<p>"Recently, film companies have repeatedly received reports that films depicting Chinese people have suffered enormous criticism and setbacks overseas. This is because the portrayals of Chinese people in these films are full of absurdities. They either call Chinese people 'Chinaman' or depict Chinese people with pigtails, and even the dialogue uses the unbearable 'Pidgin English.' Furthermore, the depictions of Chinese people's fondness for gambling and opium addiction, including the bizarre shapes of low-class squalid gambling dens and opium dens, as well as depictions of kidnappers and robbers, are all untrue. Today's China is no longer what it used to be. Opium smokers have disappeared, 'Pidgin English' is only spoken by the lower classes, and pigtails have long been abolished."</p>
<h3>Movie Novel - A Record of Loyal Souls</h3>
<p>Cavalcade (3) Ne ·</p>
<p>Qi Yin drank with him, her heart a blur, not knowing whether she was happy or sad. But this new century, the first minute of the first day of the new hundred years, Qi Yin would remember it forever: that icy night, the distant chimes, the torchlight procession in the streets, the factory whistles welcoming the new year, the flowers offered by the servants, Robert's smile, the children's faces full of wonder, and everything else. But what she remembered most clearly was the song of Oran Hill sung in the streets. From then on, every time she thought of this memorable night, she would hear the tune of Oran Hill in her ears.</p>
<p>But even after hearing the tune of Oran Hill, the surging in her heart had not stopped, and an exhilarating marching song began to play again. Although Robert was among the crowd, singing "Girls, he is the Queen's Warrior," Qi Yin stood at the door listening, her heart breaking inch by inch. And also, at that moment on the pier, Qi Yin, in her grief and numbness, could still feel Ellen standing next to her, holding that child, that blessed, carefree child, who did not understand that many of these soldiers going to South Africa would be buried in foreign lands, never to return.</p>
<p>The gong sounded, and the ship was about to set sail. Robert said to Qi Yin, "I want to kiss you, then you turn your head and, as usual, talk to me while walking forward. You don't have to look back."</p>
<p>"Yes," Qi Yin's voice choked in her throat. She talked to Robert: "I'm glad I didn't bring the children. They're too young. How would they know all this? Isn't Qiao Yi a little under the weather? It's better not to bring him out." Although Qi Yin's mouth was saying irrelevant small talk, in her heart she was crying and shouting, begging him not to go. She continued the conversation: "You're not here now. I know. I feel like you've already left, Robert: : : Robert: : :"</p>
<p>She hurriedly turned her head, and the ship was slowly moving. She looked for Robert in a large crowd, but her eyes were full of tears, and she couldn't see anything even a foot away. How could she find him? She felt Ellen supporting her. Ellen's own man had also gone to war. The two of them, sharing the same fate, supported each other and returned to that strangely empty and quiet home.</p>
<p>From then on, the days were entirely managed by Ellen alone. She also had a man fighting in South Africa, so she could understand Qi Yin's pain. Sometimes she would tell the children to be quiet so that Qi Yin could get some sleep, or she would tease the children and play noisily to cheer Qi Yin up. These were all Ellen's efforts to protect Qi Yin. The clever and kind Ellen was no longer just an ordinary servant woman, but a good companion in loneliness.</p>
