<p>李際春部由我方收編四千人</p>
<p>劃定豐潤灤縣等處爲其防地</p>
<p>天津駐唐日軍已開始向灤東撤退、七日開走四列車、八日開走四列車、日鐵甲車一列、八日下午三時由榆關抵唐山。灤河鐵橋經僞奉山路派工修理。七日晚七時竣工。（八日專電）</p>
<p>天津據確訊。大連會議决定。李際春部現有萬人。由我方收編四千人。餘衆遣散。李之名義及編遣費數目。在北平商定。將來李部防地。已劃定豐潤·灤縣。及唐山以東鐵路沿線。俟李部編遣就緒。唐山至榆關即恢復通車。仍由中國管理。如無特别事故發生。塘沽不再開會議。（八日專電）</p>
<p>北平雷壽榮。殷桐。今晚八時半抵平。即謁何黃。報告在連會議情形。薛之珩在津下車。（八日專電）</p>
<p>北平接收委會前派赴大連出席會議代表雷殷薛等三人。因會議終了。七日下午五時。乘日輪天津丸離連返津。今晚四時抵塘沽。殷桐等擬夜車來平謁何黃。報告大連會議經過。（八日專電）</p>
<p>北平僞軍善後問題。李際春曾要求將遣散官兵一律發給遣散費。此問認爲此項欵項甚鉅。恐難以照數發給。無補實際。故將此問題一併發交冀省府及接收委會會同辦理。（八日專電）</p>
<p>北平日軍撤退日期。已定十日起開始唐山·寗河·豐潤日軍開始沿北寗路撤退。薊縣·密雲·遵化·平谷·興隆各縣日軍。亦準備於一週內撤退長城線。我方定十日起開始接收日軍撤退各縣。北寗路交通亦定十五日恢復聯運。（八日專電）北平薛雷殷等三代表。定今夜過津抵平。謁何黃報告。聞僞軍改編警察額數。已規定爲三千名。其未經收編長官。每名給百元遣散。士兵每名十元。遣散回籍（八日專電）</p>
<p>天津赴大連會議代表薛之珩·雷壽榮·殷桐。七日由大連乘天津丸八日下午三時抵塘沽。換乘專車四時半抵津。錢宗澤蒞站歡迎。薛在車站下車。雷殷在總站下車。赴省府謁于主席。各報記者在東站及省府訪問。均被拒絶。雷殷五時半赴</p>
<p>平。錢宗澤隨行。（八日專電）</p>
<p>北平記者在車站晤錢宗澤。據談此次大連會議。大體雖已决定將來能否可行。須經平方一度考慮。外傳日軍在某處設監兵。我方根本反對。改編僞軍人數。大概在三五千人。唐山至榆關之列車。在政治問題未解决前。不能開車。可時接收失地。尙未定期。（八日專電）</p>

<h3 id="c3">馮玉祥否認赤化 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>北平察事自調解停頓後。當局正力謀解决新途徑。馮玉祥與平方仍時有函電往還。宋哲元態度仍冷淡。望調回陽泉防地。秦德純定後日代宋哲元赴觀音堂一帶閱軍。並向兵士訓話。（八日專電）</p>
<p>北平馮玉祥對人表示。本人以抗日爲唯一任務。張垣軍隊。均擔負抗日工作。總期能收復一部失地。即收復一部。盡力去作。本人宗旨。完全站在三民主義的</p>
<p>立塲。外間說我已赤化。純爲挑撥之詞。我槍口只知向外。絶不對內。將來是非。總有大白的一天。（八日專電）</p>
<p>北平閻近電中央。申述個人對察態度。內容分三點。㈠目前救國之道。首在安定人心。欲安定人心。必須裁縮軍隊。同時財政上量入爲出。財政穏定。人心亦因而安定。㈡察事目前尙易於處理。最好迅速解决。㈢個人對有利於國家者。無不樂從。（八日專電）</p>
<p>北平趟丕廉返晋。已將中央對察主旨向閻詳陳。昨晚有電到平。將再代表閻來平。先經大同赴張垣訪馮。對察局有相當了解。閻頗願負起調停察局責任。但馮態度堅决。日前曾召部屬訓話。表示願以抗日名義而死。作歷史上之犧牲。（七日專電）</p>
<p>北平方振武定今由張垣赴宣化。鮑剛部移駐晋邊暖泉後。已編完竣。共有三千八百餘人。槍二千餘支。（七日專電）</p>
<p>北平晋某要人表示。㈠共黨盤踞察省。地方殊爲可慮。將來華北治安。亦必</p>
<p>受影響。㈡察省安危。與外交關係至鉅。</p>
<p>因日軍茂木騎兵旅團。及松木第十四師團。月前準備由承德開往多倫。晋綏與察境昆連。唇齒相依。故極望察局早定。連日中央來電。率多本此主旨。一面仍希望能歸和平解决。故和平運動雖告停頓。并非完全絶望。將來如何打開僵局。須待閻之最後調停。（八日專電）</p>
<p>太原閻仍在籍。俟汽路修通。即來省。趙丕廉因連日大雨路阻未往謁閻。察事僅以電與閻恊商。八日午赴新鄕出席會議後。仍將返并。此間對調解察事。消</p>

<p>北平平東各縣自停戰恊定簽訂。日軍雖撤退。但僞軍及土匪乘機而起。僞軍任意委任縣長及各局局長。如玉田一縣。來僞軍數十名。强迫民意。推該縣紳士張向鴻爲縣長。以素販海洛英名楊樹春者爲公安局長·勾結土匪約二千餘人。搶奪財物。民不堪命。寳坻三河兩縣長。均已返任。薊縣長亦不日返職。（八日專電）</p>

<p>今日之社會。觀其都巿。崇樓宇。轟立雲霄。歌臺舞榭士女如雲豪華影象令人歆羨。然而一究其內幕則氣象悉慘。陰霾四布。儳焉不可終日。此本無間於歐美日本與中國。惟以中國爲尤甚耳。此種社會現角。若加以客觀之分析。則經濟因素。實爲其廠結之所在。用藉下述二事一證明之。</p>
<p>㈠犯罪問題　世人對於犯罪問題。十九泥於倫理道德觀念。以爲犯罪者必其人生而混沌。生而梟獍。不然則無敎之民。而蒙鄙野不可以理喩者耳。於是而有所謂奬勵廉恥之舉焉。於是又有所謂嚴刑峻罰之誅焉。然而先哲有言。「主食足而後知禮義。」再就事實分析之。則一九三二年公共租界發生之犯罪案。共一六。四三九件。而會於「重大之侵害財產案」（第二類。）與　　「輕微之侵害財產案」（第三類。）兩項共有百數十件。第一類之綁票案與因財產謀殺案。以及第五類「雜項罪案」中之行使僞鈔票案與僞銀幣案。又不下數十百件。至於其他所謂「重大之侵害人身案」未曾註明案由者。其中尙不知包含幾許財產因素。即此亦可斷定法許折獄。其多數。乃起於財</p>
<p>產之爭。而所謂財產之爭。又有大多數。爲經濟困窘。迫之使然。此觀於下述一九三二年捕房破獲各類盜竊屬實案件之事績。而益可信。當年是類案件。共計一二。八五一件。其中持械搶劫者六八０。搶刦一０九。盜竊四六六。侵入家宅等六三二。攫搶六九０。普通盜竊七。二九一。翦綹九八三。可見所謂侵犯財產之罪犯。均爲失業窮苦之民。此其一。</p>
<p>〕㈡自殺問題　睚殺之增加。爲中國近十以來之一種新生現象。夫人孰不貪生而惡死。然而黃浦灘頭。吳淞江上。躍入中流。葬身魚腹者。日不知其幾何人也。隻身逆旅。閉門仰藥。或男女同寢。枕藉而死者。又不知其幾何人也。統計家臚列其自殺原因。曰「生計困難。」曰「失戀。」曰「墮落。」曰「家庭問題。」曰「營業失敗。」曰「疾病。」曰「寃抑。」曰「被虐待」云云者。分門别類。一若各有原因。性質逈異者然。然當追求實際。罔不肇基於經濟。彼因　　「失戀。」而自殺者。其所以失戀直接間接之與經濟有會者。十常八九也。彼因「寃抑」而自殺者。其所以致此寃抑。直接間扫之不能離會經濟會係者。又十常八九也。此其二。</p>
<p>由前言之。人之犯罪也。非生而能犯罪。乃社會經濟環境。有以迫之。由後言之人之自殺。非樂於戕生。亦社會經濟困窮。有以驅之。在現社會中不堪之現象。日出而無窮。憂時之士。徒然歎息人心不古。世事日非。亦何益乎。</p>

<p>（李氏丰采）</p>
<p>李將軍現年五十三歲、御淡灰色西裝、體格魁梧、髮已斑白、惟精神至爲强健、態度謙和、語多感慨、此次與李將軍同來者、計有秘書劉序伯·譯員劉觀仁·兩人、曁由滬赴港迎接李氏之駐滬代表劉丕光、王子耀、蔣櫻等、至王德林氏現仍留港、並未同來、</p>
<p>（抗日經過）</p>
<p>李將軍昨在輪次、接見各報社記者、據談、本人前在東北抗日、爲時十有三月、自哈爾濱而至密山、先後身經大小百餘戰、曾有八縣固守達八月有餘、目前尙有一部份之部隊、潛留吉</p>
<p>省、最近曾佔領密山·寳清·虎林·饒河·等四縣、東寗亦已由王德林部佔領、</p>
<p>（退俄原因）</p>
<p>今年一月六日、本人駐紥於密山城內、指揮所部、在密山附近、約有一百六十里處激戰、迨至八日、敵軍以裝甲車一百十七輛、繞道至我軍後方、施以襲擊、以致前後截斷、本人率領衛隊一連、突圍而出、目睹大勢已去、無能爲力、乃於九日忍痛退入俄境、</p>
<p>（往返六月）</p>
<p>本人自出國而至歸國、先後共計六個月、留居於蘇聯者、計有三月、神經系因受刺激而反常、以致日與醫藥爲伴、旋往柏林就醫、勾留半月、嗣又轉往羅馬休養、爲時一月、其餘則均在舟車旋運之中、隨同本人退入俄境之部隊、目前均已取道新疆歸國、共計約有七</p>
<p>千餘人、現均暫駐於新省、警備邊疆、</p>
<p>（歐遊印象）</p>
<p>蘇聯之第一五年計劃、業已成功、第二五年計劃、亦已開始、人民之生活頗爲艱苦、然對於建設則異常努力、實可欽佩、德國總理希特勒氏、頗得全國人民之信仰與敬愛、國社黨之黨員、滿佈全國、卍字之標幟、觸目皆是、意大利之首相墨索里尼氏、實爲一愛國主義者、本人在意曾與會晤、意國最近十年來之建設、突飛猛進、墨索里尼氏之力也、</p>
<p>（會晤張氏）</p>
<p>本人前在羅馬、曾與張學良氏會晤多次、張氏决在羅馬留居三月、然後再行赴其他各國考察、張氏身體現已復原、恢復民國十四年以前之狀態矣、</p>
<p>（丁超被擄）</p>
<p>丁超將軍、本其不屈不撓之精神、與日僞軍肉搏死戰、在寳清作戰時、因丁將軍堅不肯退、終爲日軍所擄、初解至哈爾濱、繼又轉解至長春、及本人至俄時、則聞僞組織有頒特赦令之說、擬即起用丁將軍、但丁將軍終不爲利誘、表示拒絶、乃有被害之說、迄今消息查沉、但丁氏被害之說、是否確實、至今仍無從證實、</p>
<p>（今後行止）</p>
<p>自塘沽恊定簽字後、抗日軍事、已告一段落、本人此次歸國、在於辦理善後、至於抗日之主張、始終不變、本人將在滬稍事休息、再行晋京、向中央報告抗日之經過、然後赴贛、晋謁蔣委員長、將來仍擬來滬休養、不願就任何職位、國人大多數均重視個人之生命與財產、較諸國家與民族爲尤甚、本人深望國人此後痛改前非、處處須以國家與民族爲前提、急起直追、未爲晚焉、</p>
<p>（馬蘇往訪）</p>
<p>李氏於二時四十分抵中國飯店後、公安局長文鴻恩旋即往訪、談約十餘分鐘辭出、三時許、馬占山將軍偕張殿九往訪、蘇炳文將軍亦接踵而至、彼此對於部屬善後問題、均經詳細交換意見、歷一時許、馬蘇等始行興辭、</p>
<p>（昨晚歡宴）</p>
<p>杜月笙·張嘯林等、於昨晚七時、在海格路範圍、設延爲李氏洗塵、並請馬占山·蘇炳文等作陪、當時觥籌交錯寳生至九時許、始盡歡而散、</p>
<p>李氏擬在滬勾留一週、即行晋京向中央報告一切、再轉道入贛、晋謁蔣委員長、報告抗日經過、李氏並定於今日下午二時、在靜安寺路滄洲飯店、招等各報社記者、報告與日抗戰詳細經過云、</p>

<h3 id="c158">壽險保單之分析　費孟福 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>人壽保險藉壽險公司與被保人（通稱保户）間所定之契約（所謂保單）而發生法律上之效力。公司所當付之金額爲保單之面値，保戶所應繳之欵項爲保費。　　企望壽險保障者必需有一大羣人，蓋如此平均法則方可運用無訛，而壽險公司始能確知每保戶所應繳納之保費數額爲何。故欲申述個别保單之運用則需假定有一大團體之投保人在。</p>
<p>公司所負之危險</p>
<p>假設有年齡爲三十歲者一千人，同時投保壽險，每人規定於保單上無儲蓄之特質，惟望身後有千元可付於其產業（受益人，）是以保險公司所担負之危險，爲千倍千元或一百萬元矣，公司如欲征收正確數額之保費，則需先知此團體中之各人，將於何時死亡。根據保險死亡率表，吾人已深知於第一年內此一千人决不致全體死亡。惟此團體中之死亡率將逐年增中，乃爲可確信而無異議者也。</p>
<p>於第一年內此千人中均有八人死亡。如此僅需極簡單之計算，當知公司若向每人征收八元，即可担保此千人一年內之千元壽險矣。</p>
<p>保障之費用</p>
<p>於第二年初，此團體將短少八人，而死亡者之數目將較多，因此每年應繳之保險費用亦將較高矣。保障之費用每年增加及至尙生存者之年齡達六十或七十時，每人之保險勢必極高。是以保險公司應籌劃一種方策，藉使團體中之各份子可逐年平均分配其爲保險所耗之費用以至終身。此可藉片收平匀保費（Ｌeve,　Premlum)之方法以實現之。如此，首數年所征收者當較確實所需者爲高，故可積成一種準備基金，以爲將來死亡率增高時之準備。於終身保單之下投保人終身繼續繳納保費，而於任何時遭逢不測保險公司立即按保單　之面値付於投保人之受益人。</p>
<p>終峰保單</p>
<p>關於此種保單如何可保障保戶以防禦當前之危險，容吾人稍加討論如次；　　第一，此種保單保障保戶之家屬。因此原由，當家庭保障爲投保之主要動機時，此種保單恒爲人所樂取。於第一次保費業經繳納之後，一筆巨欵現金產業立即置成。此產額較藉其他任何方法經多年所儲蓄者爲大。</p>
<p>準備値</p>
<p>第二，此種保單之準備値逐年增加，至終當保戶達普通退修年齡時，（六十歲或六十五歲）彼將於其壽險保單上有一豐美而絶對確定之基金。當保戶至年老時，家庭保障之需要或已大减。因此彼可註銷其保險之大部份，而取回現</p>
<p>金値来自身之用。</p>
<p>假使上述之一千人不喜繼續爲其保險繳。納保費，而寗願限於若干於若干年內繳納較高之保費，公司乃可發行限期繳費保單以代替終身保單。於此情形之下，保費僅限於首十年，十五年，或二十年內繳清。爲此保單每年所應繳之保費旣較爲終身保單所繳納者爲高，其儲蓄特質顯亦較大。保戶至年老時，可積成一較高之準備値。此準備値可由保戶爲本身之目的而領取云。</p>
<p>儲蓄原素</p>
<p>此一羣投保人或許仍稱未能滿意。除保險保障外，彼等欲於契約中含有一較大之儲蓄原素，彼等欲於五十，六十，或七十歲時不繼續投保，而可領取一巨額儲欵。公司可發行儲蓄保單以適應此種要求。保費分十年，十五年，二十年，二十五年，或三十年繳納之。</p>
<p>保戶若於定期內云亡，公司則按其保單之面値付於其受益人。若保戶於定期之末依然健在，則保欵可付於保戶本人。</p>

<p>本篇爲現任華安合羣保壽股份有限公司專門顧問及名譽董事郁賜君所著先此而發表者已有三篇本文爲第四篇於保壽事業可以促進社會經濟民生福利及中國保壽公司有藉專家指導之必要均有詳細之論述</p>
<p>人壽保險一專業也，其需要專門之人才，與工程法律醫藥等專業相同。從事保壽業者，欲圖營業發達，須有專家之指導，前文已論之矣。本篇徇讀者來函之請，於壽險之爲專業，其基本原理若何，及保壽計算員所需之資格若何，將力爲解述。良以保壽之學含有極深之數理在，素無數學修養之人，其理頗不易明也。</p>
<p>保壽之起源前文嘗一度論及，朋好相邀醵錢賙恤先故者之遺屬。由此簡單之意義漸次擴大而成爲現今最重要之社會組織。其裨益於社會民生，實非數字可計。某權威者有言；「當此世界不景氣聲中，社會中賴有此一層保障，否則其結查恐更不堪設想也。」</p>
<p>自保壽業由個人與個人之間互助之性質漸次演進時，因經騐之詔示，其有待科學之研究而解决之問題乃日漸發生。如年齡問題即屬其一，除因疾病或遭不測而死者外，年齡愈高者其趨末日之途自愈接近，故年齡之大小於付欵之多寡，應有公允之分配。自有保壽公司組織以來，此種付欵或現今普通稱之爲保險費者，乃由公司依投保人年齡之大小訂定而收集之，而由公司盡賙恤其中死者遺屬之義務。</p>
<p>此制度初行之時，保壽公司僅恃政府或公共團體所調查死亡率之統計，以爲訂定保險費之標準。但此項統計係概括普遍的戶口而言。爲使保險費之公允計，凡身體不健全之人，不可任其保壽，否則被保者多屬屠弱之人，死亡率必</p>
<p>致增高，而保費旣依此標準而定，勢必過高，而爲個人經濟力所不能及矣。</p>
<p>上述缺點旣經發現，投保者須經選擇之手續，然後確定其初行之方法爲組織一選擇委員會，專任此事，繼乃進步而有醫生之檢騐體格；至今各保壽公司之醫務部，以其有關營業之盛衰，蓋已爲極生要之一部份矣。</p>
<p>保壽公司自有醫務部之設立，漸能自製死亡率之統計，以代前引之官方統計。其法集多數保壽公司，各出其實地經騐所供給之材料加以分晰整理，而製成之。其第一次之統計表名「保壽計算法」或「經騐集成」係在西歷一千八百肆十三年出版，由十七家英國保壽公司所供給其材料者。現今英國通用之統計表，爲倫敦保壽計算學會所編其材料更爲詳盡。至美國現供所用者，尙係一千</p>
<p>八百六十八年出版之「美國經濟保壽統計表」。此外，專爲熱帶及亞熱帶各國所編之統計表亦有專著也。</p>
<p>自有上述之統計表後，保壽計算員乃能用科學之方法，對於保險費用有精密之計算，而無倚輕倚重之弊。蓋定保險費之多寡，除以保欵數目爲比例外，更須視投保者年齡之大小，以察在此年齡中之死亡率爲何。苟無此項統計，則無精確之標準可資依循矣。雖然此非謂投保者年長一歲其去死期愈近一年，故其保險費亦應年有增加，若此則保險費愈長愈高，必爲被保者之經濟能力所不許。保壽公司前有依此原則而定保險費者，無不遭遇失敗。嗣後乃挅行所謂「均保險費平」之制度，即保險費先加訂定，在保期內一律以此數爲準不加增長。此制度之根據，即用挹彼注此之法，以保險期內前半期保費之有餘，抵補後半期之不足。保壽公司集此欵而另存放，吸取複利以爲日後履行義務之凖備。此欵即名曰；「保證金」，乃保壽公司隨時應有之凖備金也。此凖備金之性質複雜若此，則其數目之計算，應如保始足應付需要，是非專門計算員不能任之也</p>
<p>凡百事業未有能較壽險業更穏固而更是易收效者。試以事實證之，歐洲大戰</p>
<p>及戰後，疫癘盛行，死人無算，然未聞保壽公司有因而倒閉者。更以目前之情形而論，世界經濟衰落，百業不振，而壽險業獨有長足之進展。推源其故，壽險業基於科學原理，合乎時代需要，從事此業者，復多爲才識豐富之人，原理得以充分應用，更因各國壽險法之完全，投資於壽險業之大衆，其利益有保障，故壽險業之能蒸蒸日上者，即以此耳。</p>
<p>中國壽險法之訂定，僅爲近年之事，然此亦足證壽險業之漸爲社會所重視矣。現行之法旣屬初創，較之他國自難同日而語；然欲加改進，非合專家之力，借材異域，則不易言。故此點恐現猶難望其實現，而中國保壽計算員因本國壽險法之不完全，不足保障公共利益，於外國壽險法更有深切認識之必要，此點請於下期本特刋內再行討論及之，</p>
<h3 id="c161">美國保險事業之偉大　達 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>保險事業在美國驚人的偉大和重要，我們可以從紐約州政府保險部的報告中想像得到。紐約全州核准設立之各級保險公司所積聚的資產，不下三百二十</p>
<p>四萬萬九千一百三十六萬餘元，佔美國全國財富總數百分之十。一九三０年間，她們的資產尙不止此數，曾經達到過三千二百九十萬萬元之多。歷年各公司繳存政府的準備金，至一九三二年止，已有九十萬萬元。紐約各保險公司的資產，較之美國國債一百九十五萬萬元，尙超出兩倍而有餘。現在各公司的股本</p>
<p>，每股平均可値二百六十餘元。</p>
<p>美國各種保險的被保人，享有全國總財富百分之十。他們的財力，除了償付全部國債以外，還能付給每一個居住在美國的人，以一百元的欵項。假若他們要把這些欵項，立刻提取現金，那麽，需要三倍半美國全國所流通及庫藏的現欵，方足應付。</p>
<p>在一九三二年中，紐約全州各人壽保險公司，每天均有大量的保費收入，因爲當時多數人爲謀財產穏妥，生活安全計，都有保險的需要，是以被保人每日向公司繳納的保費，計有一千五百萬元上下。此時各公司所吠收的現金，約占流通貨幣百分之八十。這種巨大勢力的應用和需要，也可以從他支付與被保人的欵項中，看得出來。在同年中，公司因死亡，火災，意外，疾病，地震，風災，經濟恐慌，紅利等的支出總數，不下三十五萬萬七千八百一十九萬餘元，將近流通貨幣的五分之三，每日（星期日除外）平均約一千一百餘萬元。　　各保險公司即以現在所擁的資財而論，以後縱無保費及各種投資押欵的利息的收入，雖連年遭遇一九三二年同樣的損失，亦足以維持九年而不致失敗。　　保險經理人，有各種流利的言詞，適當的理由，因之使男女，事業，貨物等等，自身有保險的需要。没有他們這種努力的效果，則公司自身，亦不致累聚造成這種偉大的勢力。</p>
<p>從上列各種統計上，我們可以認識保險事業在在美國所佔的勢力，及其任務的偉大重要。</p>

<p>— 王延松</p>
<p>本人願負弩前驅</p>
<p>願同胞共爲後援</p>
<p>讀海關進口貨統計表而愀然焉！進口貨之第一位曰棉布·第八位曰呢絨；是皆我國同胞衣被之所資，如潮如山，百貨莫敵，而素以艶麗著聞之我國綢緞，反日漸於衰落，委貨於地，旁求諸人，是何異於棄家鷄而嗜野鶩？國弱民貧，宜其有此！</p>
<p>夫商而曰戰，則今日之商者，固非僅僅焉如昔日之求什一之利者可比。而我國自互巿以來，商則有之，戰則未也。商與商自戰則有之，與外商戰則未也。彼外商以吾爲巿塲。捆戰彼之國貨以來，如入無人之境，而吾之商，方日爲彼商　導，或略分其芻秣以爲館，寗不可悲可恥！近數年來，刺激日深，觀念遂易，愛國心理，日漸深入，商人亦自熟知提倡國貨之重要，而國產綢緞，遂呈活氣。</p>
<p>雖然，譬之戰焉，戰士衝鋒陷陣，爲其天職，而軍糈之供給，與民衆之後援，亦爲取勝之所必需。以今日之國產綢緞，與舶來綢緞戰，則綢緞業商，爲當陣之戰士，而金融業實綰其餉糈，全體民衆，又爲其惟一之後援。惟金融業與綢緞業合作，而餉糈这來源，斯不虞匱乏，惟全體民衆有所衣，必衣國產，而後援以固。延松無狀，一方面爲衝鋒陷陣之戰士，一方面又業負接濟餉糈之軍需，負弩前驅，固不敢辭；所懇切期望於同胞者，願同胞各盡後援之責，以固守此衣的陣線，區區私衷，如此而已。</p>

<p>— 蕉</p>
<p>現在已經七月，夏季的衣服，差不多大家都已購備，自然要想到秋季的服裝了。</p>
<p>男子們自然很少有空閑功夫，想到這一層，但是小姐們或者愛美的年輕太太們，自然急於未雨綢繆，他們在打算怎樣得到美麗的衣料，而在經濟上非常合算。</p>
<p>美麗的衣料，首推綢緞，而秋季的衣料只「綢」是最適用，但是一般的綢，不是花樣不新鮮，便是價錢很貴，舶來　品的綢，當然更貴，當然爲愛國而深明事理的名媛們所一致不用，自然在國產綢中選擇了。</p>
<p>美亞織綢廠的糺綬縐，是完全眞絲織造的最新出品，質地非常柔薄，光澤也十分絢爛，但是没有人造絲織品太光亮的火氣，而事實上又比印度綢堅牢；還有一個特長，便是不會坐縐折縐││女人的衣服，穿在身上第一個要件，便是不要有縐痕，縐痕一多，便不雅觀了。　　糺綬縐是印着各式新奇花樣，聰敏的女子，他們都能夠揀着合乎自己所喜歡的花樣而購買，不論是肥的瘦的，或年齡的大小，與衣服的花樣色澤，都有極大的連帶關係。（譬如身子肥的，穿紅色衣服不美觀，身子瘦的如穿長條花樣的衣服，愈顯得是瘦長，也不美觀）糺綬縐各種色澤花樣極多，在聰明的綢店夥員，一定可以把適合於各人所需要的糺縐供獻於他們。這一種糺綬現在上海巿商會內國產綢緞展覽會有大批新貨陳列，而南京路的中國國貨公司和先施·永安·新新·麗華各百貨公司及各大綢莊，都有發售，貨價是非常低廉。</p>
<p>普通一件旗袍，大概須八尺或八尺半</p>
<p>綢料，才能做成，但是糺綬縐九尺，即能製成兩件，這不是很經濟的麽？因爲糺綬縐門面有二尺八寸的闊，是任何綢疋所没有的，現在有一個裁剪的方法，刋圖於左；</p>

<p>從海關統計册上，看到絲的出口，逐年减少，世界巿塲的絲價，亦日貶賤，國內絲廠，舍閉廠停工，造成恐怖之新紀錄，别無辦法。因國際絲巿塲，早爲暴日所侵奪，而產絲之地的農</p>
<p>民，爲生計所繫，不得不抱痴漢望來年的觀念，繼續養蠶培桑，但國外向無華人金融之組織，國內又無直接對外貿易之樞紐，出品復墨守陳法，遂致不能吸引國外之顧客，而生產品遂壅積於國內巿塲，其織成綢緞之唯一出路，僅供少許國人享用而已。兼以連年烽火，穀賤傷農，燦爛華麗的外貨，挾其傾銷政策，縱橫於吾國內，而國貨綢緞的銷路，致無立錐餘地。絲繭是國產中一大利源，一旦綢緞屯積巿塲，影響民生，至爲重大，若不早爲之計，則絲綢將一蹶而不復振。現在綢業有國產綢緞展覽會之舉，引起國人服用，其本國所製之絲質材料，其所負的使命，非僅供觀摩已也。須知採用國貨的心理建設，在此一舉；復振國綢的大事業，也在此一舉！我們對於來參觀的，應作大規模的測騐，以爲將來振興國綢與改良國綢之張本。其法可印成現成問題，或製一表圖，使觀客塡寫，並使觀客瞭解國綢展覽，並非僅僅來參看熱閙，換句話，不是僅副觀客之眼福，實具有輔助綢業，改良織造，鞏固基礎之重大使命，俾國產絲綢之利源，仍操於國人之掌握中，試舉數點於後；</p>

<p>㈠最適用之綢料；</p>
<p>㈡最合意之顔色；</p>

<p>㈤對於定價太低，抑或太高？</p>
<p>㈥觀客之性别，與年齡職業，</p>
<p>㈦何廠出品，最爲喜歡？</p>
<p>㈧何種貨品，價最公道？</p>
<p>將以上各點收集分析之，即可瞭解顧客的心理，故展覽會的意義，祇爲引起顧客之購買動機，及辨别國綢起見而展覽，予認爲非根本的展覽。欲求綢業之發展，及生產之暢銷，當根據測騐所得之結果，而定營業方針，及織造政策，趁此國綢展覽的機會而利用之，求事實上之根據，勿以盲人騎瞎馬之動作，做猜想的估計。凡不合顧客心理之出品，趕快停止織造，免降消耗與堆積之危險。</p>

<p>他從夢中醒來，扭亮了電炬，一看小檯上的圓金鐘，已經是三句半了，他揉一揉雙眼，把他的夢境，重新來温一下││</p>
<p>他在他的書室裏，一個人獨自坐着，展玩她親自給他的照片，正在懷念她的時候，她忽然姗姗的來了，他喜歡得跳了起來，急忙走過去，雙手執住了她玉樣的白手，說道；</p>
<p>「月！你竟會來，你竟會在這個時候，我正在想念你啊！我想這個時候能夠來，是最能安慰我的了，豈知出人意料你竟然會來，」</p>
<p>「英！我一個人在讀沫若新詩，給他詩中一吸引，單獨的一個感覺得非常的不安，同時我的意想中，仿彿有人在期待着我，你想，這個期徒着我的人是誰？」</p>
<p>他的臉龐兒紅紅地說道··</p>
<p>「這個我又那知道呢！我想這個期待着你的人，一定是你最愛的人呢！」</p>
<p>「不錯，這正是我最愛的人啊！就是你，就是你···」</p>
<p>他們倆不能再矜持了，不禁兩張嘴巴，黏合在一起了，</p>
<p>意外的小貓兒，好似羨慕着他們倆的愛好一般，一聲不響地從窗外跳了進來，它這一跳倒不要緊，却驚動了我們的融洽着的一對，他們倆以爲有什麽人在捉狹鬆解了開來一看，原來是隻小貓兒啊！他們倆不禁一笑，那小貓兒却蹲在她的足下，一動不動的伏着，</p>
<p>他們倆嘴裏嚼着糖果，說着閒天，由海闊天空，說到家庭瑣碎，最後討論到衣着他說··</p>
<p>「月！你眞和我同心，我自從高小畢業之後，就把一切的外貨日常用口，棄而不用，一直到現在。雖然外貨的進口，有增無减，但是我個人，却没有一些貨品去買過它們，你也和我一樣，這可見我倆的心，是相同的，你想對嗎　　「我的英！我想我們中國人，在這樣外侮日亟的時候，還不知道大家一致服用國貨，到了那緊急關頭，除了到死路上去，我想决無别法，你看現在一般所謂摩登女郎，每天惟恐其不摩登，自頭至脚，着意研究，造成她摩登的原素，當然都是外來的物品，你想這不是極大漏巵，一個人這樣，千萬人這樣，所以造成了中國絲綢業大起恐慌，這個最大的原因，却都在摩登女郎身上，我爲要救中國，先要把摩登女郎的心，改造一下，使他們個個都有服用國貨的决心，那就有一線希望呢！」</p>
<p>「我現在新製的一襲喬其紗的新衣，比外國貨要好上不少，大概明天可以完工，我們在靜園裏碰到了給你看吧·」</p>
<p>就在這個時候，忽然醒來，他正好似吃橄欖一般地回味着。</p>
<p>他清醒了以後，案頭的鮮花，彷彿加了艶麗，他更其興奮了，也不願意再睡，拉開了抽屉取出了她的照片，看個出神。</p>
<p>後來他在靜園看見她穿了一襲新裝，是用淡</p>
<p>綠色喬其紗製成的，配上微紫色的鈕扣，更是增加她的嫵媚，他恍然記得昨晚夢中的情菜來了。</p>
<p>手挽手的走到了眉池之畔，雙雙地坐下，他將「夢」的事實告訴了她。</p>
<p>「英！你這個夢，眞奇怪極了，我這件衣裳，的確是新製的，那衣料，就在中國國貨公司買來的，他們的國產綢緞衣料眞多啊！我想一般人，爲何還要去用外國綢緞呢！我眞不解，　　「月！中國貨綢緞，正多摩登的花樣，我總要想個絶妙的方法來勸告他們····」</p>
<p>她不等說完，雙眼不瞬的注視池中，原來一對鴛鴦，此翼的靜止着，他倆也同樣地仿作了。</p>

<h3 id="c197">疑心生暗鬼 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 曹驟仁</p>
<p>往常由敎師限題作文，覺得很苦，因爲没有話可說。現在提筆作文，可以從心所欲，不拘題目了，依舊是很苦；看文章的有心病的很多，疑心生暗鬼，從無字的縫中，看出嘲笑他的剌來。魯迅先生的阿Ｑ正傳，在京報附刋發表的時候，「有許多人慄慄危懼，恐怕以後要駡到他的頭上。並且有一位朋友，當我（涵廬）面說，昨日阿Ｑ正傳上某一段彷佛就是駡他自己。因此便猜疑阿Ｑ正傳是某人作的，何以呢？因爲祗有某人知道他這一段私事。……等到他打聽出來阿Ｑ正傳的作者姓名的時候，他才知道他和作者素不相識，因此，才恍然自悟，又逢人聲明說不是駡他。」（涵廬閒話）幸而作者和犯心病的素不相識，否則魯迅先生的寃枉是吃定了。我們生在這個世界，鼻子閉了，要打嚔發鬆發鬆，原所不免；但亦多信手寫來，不含什麽深意的，而犯心病者一定說是嘲笑他，提筆者便無時不感下筆之苦，找題目之難了！阿Ｑ正傳收入呐喊集中時，還有人問魯迅先生：「你實在是在駡誰和誰呢？」魯迅先生只能悲憤地說：「我自恨不能使人看得我不至於如此下劣！」</p>
<p>昨讀兩般秋雨庵隨筆，其中有一段引了許多前人的詩。如詠瀑布詩云··「」流到前溪無一語，在山作得許多聲。」如詠鐵馬詩云：底事丁冬時作響？在人萊下不平鳴！」如詠夏雲詩云：「無限旱苗枯欲死，悠悠閒處作奇峯。」如詠蟬云：「莫倚高枝縱繁響，也應回首顧螳螂。」這些詩，好在是古人做的，若是魯迅先生做的，又不知有多少人面紅耳赤，以爲在說他</p>
<p>的隱私了。聖明天子在上，而「淸風不識字，何事亂翻書」有殺頭之禍，文字獄本來是點綴太平盛世的！</p>
<p>欲人之没有心病，卽弗羅乙德也還没有辦法，雖是苦一點，還是執筆者竤方面來改良改良罷。往昔在名公巨卿大賈豪戶之下做門客的有兩種秘诀，第一種見總說「氣争很好，近</p>
<p>來更發福啦！」他若呌我們估量年紀，四十歲的估他三十歲，五十歲的估他四十歲，雖是微笑，其喜可知。第二種他若買了古董或藏什麽字畫之類，値五十的估他一百，値一百的估他百五十，不可太估得大，顯得自已是外行，切不可估得小，顯得他是外行。而且要有話說，七成贊美，三成批評，正中他的「上懷」。這卽豐之餘先生所謂「。三丑藝術」。我们欲免於人之「欵心生暗鬼」，也只能這樣改良改良的。</p>
<p>不過「蒹葭白露」那麽一首戀歌，而小序說是「刺襄公也，未能用周禮，將無以固其國焉」。賢人的註解一多，聖人不以爲意的地方，也跳出諷刺的意味來了；我們只祈求做註解的賢人，多多開恩··因爲那想愛人的男子，是並不管什麽「用周禮」這些聞事的呀！</p>
<h3 id="c198">苟全性命法 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>近來文人容易失踪，而且一失踪便成「大團圓」，這樣的世界，實在有講究苟全性命之法之必要。</p>
<p>偶翻綫裝書，得陳眉公法，亟爲公之於世，曰；「上士閉心，中士閉口，下士閉門。」</p>
<p>閉門之計拙，顯而易見，蓋杜門不出，易召嫌疑，或以爲在秘密開會，或以爲在製造炸彈。况俗語云；「閉門家裏坐，禍從天上來」，早已道破閉門之靠不住了。</p>
<p>孔子入后稷之廟，三緘金人之口，俗語亦云··「是非只爲多開口」，閉口之要緊可知。阮嗣宗「口不臧否人物，」又嘗一醉二月，拒司馬氏之提婚，深得閉口之道，故能不蹈嵇康的覆轍，可以爲法矣，但仍有未妥處。</p>
<p>那是他的八十二首詠懐詩。這些詩，雖云「百代以下，難以情測」，但陳沆作箋，說其中多以「妾婦」譏司馬，「膏火」比小人。幸而陳杭不與嗣宗同時，否則，這些話傳到司馬氏及其部下的耳中，阮籍還能「善終」麽？</p>
<p>人而要做詠懷詩，蓋由於心的多感，縱然「言至玄遠」，但要提防「索隠」家。故上士在能閉心。</p>
<p>閉心的實例，何如先生曾經舉出，即後漢任永，見妻淫於前，匿情無言，見</p>
<p>子入井，忍而不救。</p>
<p>但你能做到否？</p>
<h3 id="c199">别一個竊火者 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 丁萌</p>
<p>火的來源，希臘人以爲是普洛美修斯從天上偷來的，因此觸了大神宙期之怒，將他鎖在高山上，命一隻大鷹天天來啄他的肉。</p>
<p>非洲的土人瓦仰安提族也已經用火，但並不是由希臘人傳授他們的。他們另</p>
<p>有一個竊火者。</p>
<p>這竊火者，人們不能知道他的姓名，或者早被却忘了。他從天上偷了火來，傳給瓦仰安提族的祖先，因此觸了大神大拉斯之怒，這一段，是和希臘古傳相像的。但大拉斯的辦法却兩樣了，並不鎖他在山巓，却秘密的將他鎖在暗黑的</p>
<p>地窖子裏，不給一個人知道。派來的也</p>
<p>不是大鷹，而是蚊子，跳蚤，臭蟲，一面吸他的血，一面使他皮膚腫起來。這</p>
<p>時還有蠅子們，是最善於尋覓創傷的脚色，嗡嗡的呌，拚命的吸吮，一面又拉許多蠅糞在他的皮膚上，來證明他是怎樣地一個不乾凈的東西。</p>
<p>然而瓦仰安提族的人們，並不知道這一個故事。他們單知道火乃酋長的祖先所發明，給酋長作燒死異端和燒掉房屋之用的。</p>
<p>幸而現在交通發達了，非洲的蠅子也有些飛到中國來，我從牠們的嗡嗡營營</p>
<p>聲中，聽出了這一點點。</p>
<h3 id="c200">中間層的悲哀 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>窮人到連褲子都没得穿的目前，闊老板們自然也是憂愁的，幸而還有社會中間層在，它雖然也己乾學得可憐，但較之没有褲子穿的自還有一些油水。闊老板們的兩隻貪婪的眼睛便灼灼地射向他們。</p>
<p>他們要哭，但他們還想發財，還想女人，闊老板們也許比他們自己更明白。他伸出最誘惑最刺戟的巨靈來，不怕這些中間層不落網；</p>
<p>「只費吹灰之力，便可點壳成金！」</p>
<p>「欲探裸宫，此其時矣！」</p>
<p>公子哥兒自然不希罕這一萬八千，窮人還抽不起這十多個銅子一包的紙烟，吊兒郎當的長衫班和一把眼淚的小商人正在日夜盼來這麽一注橫財，他們的經</p>
<p>濟能力也只夠吹吹這類紙烟的灰，從此更努力地吹，「時未匝月……業已贈罄」，於是再來五十萬號。</p>
<p>另一方面告訴我們，「上下客滿，明日請早！」自然這裏邊的主顧仍是那一般不上不下的朋友。</p>
<p>不過單在畫面上即使再裸些畢竟是空的，没法只能來「徵求良侣」「徵求入贅」，我怕無論「只求性情溫和，不計貧窮，」「不論已嫁未嫁，」結果總難如願以償吧？</p>
<p>果然只費吹灰之力，但點壳成金的奇蹟究竟不能落到每個人的頭上。肚子不能常癟，破長衫還是要拖一件的，幸而報館近來肯給人登不要廣告費的「自我職業介紹，」就每天有數十條出現。有文藝天才的還可來一篇「特種自我職業介紹」。不過冷酷的現社會簡直不會來聽你這淋漓盡致的訴說，它除了要你「</p>
<p>點壳」成闊老板的金庫而外不需要你什麽的！</p>
<p>每天報紙上的大部分商業廣告，幾乎都是表示闊老板們對中間層的巧妙的榨取，同時還有相等的篇幅，是刋着被榨取者微弱的呻吟！</p>
<p>社會中間層的悲哀將一直要延長到它的消滅爲止了！</p>
<h3 id="c201">一個最新的發見 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 江直聲</p>
<p>兩個月前偶然聽得朋友們談到什麽「解放詞」以及曾某人的大名，便覺得那不過是一知半解的妄人硬想出風頭罷了；結果招來了各方面的斥駡，也許</p>
<p>他已經深悔弄巧成拙罷？那時候，我覺得像曾某那樣的人只是可笑。</p>
<p>後來無意中碰見了熟悉上海文藝界內幕的某君，聽了他的一席話，我方始知</p>
<p>道各方面對於「解放詞」的斥駡不但没有促起曾某的反省，翻使他得意揚揚；因爲人家駡到「解放詞」就會帶出曾某的大名來，曾某就可以借此出名了。世上原來就有一種人慣于裝出一付小丑臉到處大放厥詞閙笑話，而結果就出了名的，</p>
<p>曾某不過是其中么小的一個。於是我又覺得此人實在無聊而又無恥了。</p>
<p>前天忽然看見申報上崔萬秋君的廣告和中外書報新聞第五期的紀載，揭露了曾某的陰私，說他如何借朋友的名字爲自己吹牛，又如何造謠中傷他的朋友；呵！有這樣的事！於是我更覺得曾某不但無聊無恥，簡直是陰險可怕了！</p>
<p>記得前此人家批評「解放詞」的時候，有一個朋友說；什麽「打打麻將」的解放</p>
<p>詞不過等於叭兒狗的搖頭擺尾，博取太太小姐們酒餘飯後的一笑，其人其詞，都没有被批評的資格。現在知道叭兒狗嘴裏竟還有毒牙，冷不防就要咬人，連給牠麵包的手都要偷偷地咬一下。天生謬種，本來决不止一兩個，文藝界中大概還隠藏着不少，一不小心，就會被賣，無怪我的朋友某先生切戒他的兒子莫想做文學家，眞是經騐有得的話。某先生此種消極辦法其實是不行的。文藝界中人爲保持文壇的純潔計，應當努力做一番掃除的工作。至少應當多貼幾道標語；</p>
<p>「謹防生着毒牙的叭兒狗！」</p>

<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>「施五哥，」伯唐說「你太過慮了，難道他們會扣人嗎！」</p>
<p>「扣不扣，是第二層，」佩萸說，『謹愼些總好。』</p>
<p>『那末，伯唐，你何不打個电話要他明早先到這裏？來』</p>
<p>『頂好，』佩萸催着伯唐，『你就去打罷！』</p>
<p>伯萸有點厭煩了，說了一聲；『不必。』</p>
<p>『萬一眞地弄出甚麽支節呢？』佩萸說，『你不去打，那末我去！』</p>
<p>『他的電話是在隔壁借用的，現在這樣晏，大家早已睡了，誰肯去替你呌之光聽电話？………』</p>
<p>『那末明早一天明就打！』佩萸說。</p>
<p>『這還不是一樣不會有人肯做的……眞要他來，明早一大早呌阿明放車子去接，不就行了嗎！』</p>
<p>這個偶然凑攏來的戚友會議，就此通過了這樣一個議案。</p>
<p>阿明在七點鐘光景，就駕着車子往菜巿路去接之光，然而之光却早已到大南門的廠裏去了，阿明趕到廠裏，才曉得之光又早由幾個工人陪着走了，誰也不曉得他們到那裏去；廠裏的</p>
<p>情形並不緊張，因爲無工可做，所以工人也並不多。</p>
<p>伯唐的住宅是在路南的，立在那合鐵栅欄門口沿着門裡那條洋灰道兒向南一望··左邊一列洋槐和牆外鄰家的樹枝相接，右邊一座法國式的兩層灰白色洋樓；不過先看鑡的，却是那座洋樓的後段。再前二十多步，就有一道由五六級石條砌成的半圓形石階，緊接住樓下那道曲尺式的走廊的　口，繞着走廊拐灣再向南走，才是那座樓的前軒，軒前也有一道石階，長長地方方地高高地臨着樓前那片一畝多寬的草地。草色雖然只露着枯黃的影子，可是這樣的面積配着樓下那兩間並排朝南的廳子的長門和長窗，倒也很富於調和的意味。這兩痱廳子當然是伯唐素來欵待賓客之所了；可是現在，不僅兩間廳子已經改充他那些避難的戚族友朋的臨時處的主要部分，把一切陳設通通挪開；並且連廳後那條組成這座洋樓的闎部交通大動脈式的過道裡，在夜裡也要開許多地舖，所以當阿明跳下車子走上半圓石階把過道兩端臨階那合門打開的時候，還看見許多娘姨大姐們的腦袋，在地上的幾個被窩筒裡半藏半顯地露出一些兒頭髮來。</p>
<p>他從那些像鹹魚般躺着的人攤兒的縫裡，躡着脚慢慢地踏到過道靠北的扶梯邊，剛好跨上一兩步兒，就聽見他的女東家在樓上的扶梯欄杆邊問··</p>
<p>『可是阿明？張先生可曾接來？』</p>
<p>阿明根據事實報告了一遍。佩萸問道··</p>
<p>『廠裏眞没有一個人曉得嗎？你可曾仔細問過？』</p>
<p>『問過』，阿明說，『没有一個人曉得，我想他們是趁黃包車對公館裏走，那末自然要慢得』</p>
<p>到多。』</p>

<p>安樂窩生活專號上</p>
<h3 id="c221">人生的眞快樂 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>在本刋第二十六期貧民窟生活專號漫談裏，記者曾述及我</p>
<p>們發刋該專號的動機與希望，此次發刋這安樂窩生活專號，其旨</p>
<p>趣則更有說明之必要，敬就敎於讀者諸公；</p>
<p>我們深信本刋最大多數的讀者，在這文盲占百分八十以上的民族集團中，總不失爲識字階級的地位。我們的環境，也可說大多數是過着比上（安樂窩）遠不足，比下（貧民窩）或有餘的生活，所謂「中等階級」，我們或可當之而無愧罷？或有人對這所謂「中等階級」的永久性，要發生疑問，我們以爲這個階級的時間性的長短，本非我們所欲置辯，但是就目前的情形說，在這整個民族奄奄無生氣的中國現狀下丨丨尤其是在這上海半殖民地的環境中，我們覺得：深感被壓迫的痛苦與最有活力，最有勇氣，最有志願爲謀人類生活的平等而奮鬬者，還是這班所謂「中等階級」，因爲他們也是受壓迫者，同時他們對這受壓迫的所以然，也比較貧民窟中的同胞要多了解一點。我們以爲對於中華民族的前途復興與夫整個社會制度的改造，這個所謂「中等階級一實爲最銳利最靈敏的工具。我們雖知道這階級的特長，但尤應知道這個階級中一般的最大缺點，那就是很容易中途變節，見易思遷，缺少刻苦澈底的精神。這個缺點的所以發生，則多半一方面因過去環境的關係，對於一班勞苦大衆的生活的隔膜，同情心的薄弱，責任心的缺乏，改造途徑的看不清楚，另外</p>
<p>一方面，則因眩於安樂窩生活的舒適，爲個人享樂主義所誘惑，不明瞭人類進化與創造互助的原則，没有正確的人生的意義。關於前一方面，記者在二十六及二十七兩期貧民窟生活專號上，已略有論及，今日所欲討論的，則爲後一方面的問題了。</p>
<p>我們默察全國大多數勞苦羣衆的一種「愚而安愚」的情表以及最少壧安樂窩中人，怡然自得的享受外國人從互助努力的結果，所創造發明的種種物質快樂的生活，我們就時會感到這個古大民族要有没落滅亡的危懼。我們的聲音雖很微弱，然却决不甘自棄，我們要大聲疾呼，促起有志救國的同胞以及少數安樂窩生活享受者的覺悟，這種以個人爲中心的人生態度若不笖變，則一切其他救國救民的調兒，就都無從彈起了！</p>
<p>第一先要提出來討論的，就是享受安樂窩生活的人們，是不是能得到人生的眞安樂？姑即退一步從個人的立塲來說，我們知道所謂安樂，也不過是比較的名辭。譬如說「安」，乃是由動的比較而來，若是根本就不動，也就得不到所謂「安」的快感了。至於說「樂」，乃是從苦的比較而來，若根本遇不到「苦」的問題或作「苦」的追求，那麽即有所謂「樂」，也是很浮淺的，單調的。這種生活的享受者，他或她所能得到的「安樂」，是决没有旁觀的人，所想像揣測的那樣有趣味，而事實上據我們所知道的，有許多享受安樂窩生活者，因爲過分「安樂」的緣故，而感覺生活枯燥痛苦的，也是常有聞見的事。况且人不僅是能用手的動物，且是能用腦子思想，去謀求環境進步的動物，我們大概都如道，用腦子去思想研究問題，並不是一件如何快樂的事，我們很容易羨慕一個發明家，發明了一樣東西的快樂，但我們每每不注意他在未發明時所經過的種種困苦的情形。所以一個人的眞正安樂，要從動中求「安」，苦中得「樂」，從戰勝困難痛苦的「進步」中求快樂，我們以爲這才是人生的眞快樂。我們試問這種快樂的眞諦，豈是一班普通安樂窩生活的享受者所能領會的嗎？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Representatives Lei Xueyin Return to Beiping <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Li Jichun's Troops Integrate 4,000 Men into Our Forces</p>
<p>Demarcation of Fengrun, Luanxian and Other Areas as Their Defense Zones</p>
<p>Japanese troops stationed in Tangshan have begun to withdraw towards Luandong. Four trains departed on the 7th, and four trains departed on the 8th, along with one Japanese armored train. It arrived in Tangshan from Yuguan at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. The Luan River railway bridge is being repaired by workers dispatched by the puppet Fengshan Railway. It was completed at 7 PM on the evening of the 7th. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>According to reliable sources from Tianjin, the Dalian Conference decided that Li Jichun's current force of 10,000 men would be integrated into our forces with 4,000 men. The remaining troops will be disbanded. Li's title and the amount of disbandment expenses will be negotiated in Beiping. The defense zones for Li's troops have been demarcated as Fengrun, Luanxian, and the railway line east of Tangshan. Once Li's troops are integrated and disbanded, traffic from Tangshan to Yuguan will resume and remain under Chinese management. If no special incidents occur, no further conferences will be held in Tanggu. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Lei Shourong and Yin Tong from Beiping arrived in Beiping at 8:30 PM tonight. They will immediately meet with He and Huang to report on the situation at the Dalian Conference. Xue Zhiheng disembarked in Tianjin. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Lei Yin and Xue, the three representatives dispatched by the Beiping Reception Committee to attend the conference in Dalian, left Dalian on the Japanese ship Tianjin Maru at 5 PM on the afternoon of the 7th due to the end of the conference and returned to Tianjin. They arrived in Tanggu at 4 AM tonight. Yin Tong and others plan to take the night train to Beiping to meet with He and Huang to report on the progress of the Dalian Conference. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Regarding the post-settlement of the puppet troops in Beiping, Li Jichun requested that disbandment fees be issued to all discharged officers and soldiers. This was deemed to involve a substantial amount of money and was considered difficult to provide in full. As such, the matter has been jointly referred to the Hebei Provincial Government and the Reception Committee for handling. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>The date for the Japanese troop withdrawal from Beiping has been set to begin on the 10th. Japanese troops in Tangshan, Ninghe, and Fengrun will begin to withdraw along the Beining Railway. Japanese troops in Jixian, Miyun, Zunhua, Pinggu, and Xinglong counties are also preparing to withdraw from the Great Wall line within a week. Our side has scheduled to start receiving the various counties from which Japanese troops are withdrawing on the 10th. Traffic on the Beining Railway is also scheduled to resume joint operations on the 15th. (Special Dispatch, 8th) The three representatives from Beiping, Xue, Lei, and Yin, are scheduled to pass through Tianjin and arrive in Beiping tonight to report to He and Huang. It is reported that the quota for the reorganization of puppet troops into police has been set at 3,000. Unincorporated officers will be given 100 yuan each for disbandment, and soldiers will be given 10 yuan each, and then sent back to their hometowns. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Xue Zhiheng, Lei Shourong, and Yin Tong, the representatives from Tianjin to the Dalian Conference, arrived in Tanggu at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 8th aboard the Tianjin Maru, which left Dalian on the 7th. They transferred to a special train and arrived in Tianjin at 4:30 PM. Qian Zongze came to the station to welcome them. Xue disembarked at the station, while Lei and Yin disembarked at the main station. They went to the Provincial Government to meet with Chairman Yu. Reporters from various newspapers were denied access at both the East Station and the Provincial Government. Lei and Yin left for</p>
<p>Beiping at 5:30 PM. Qian Zongze accompanied them. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>A reporter from Beiping met Qian Zongze at the station. According to him, the general outline of the Dalian Conference has been decided, but its feasibility remains to be considered in Beiping. It is rumored that the Japanese army is setting up guard posts in certain areas, which our side fundamentally opposes.

<p>Since the mediation of the Chahar incident stalled, the authorities are actively seeking new ways to resolve it. Feng Yuxiang and Beiping are still in frequent communication via letters and telegrams. Song Zheyuan's attitude remains lukewarm, hoping to be transferred back to the Yangquan defense area. Qin Dechun is scheduled to inspect the troops in the Guanyintang area on the day after tomorrow, replacing Song Zheyuan, and will address the soldiers. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang stated to people in Beiping that his sole mission is to resist Japan. The troops in Zhangjiakou are all undertaking anti-Japanese work. The overall goal is to recover some of the lost territories, and to do our best to act accordingly. His principles are completely aligned with the Three Principles of the People. The rumors that he has been "reddened" are purely divisive. His guns are pointed only outwards and never inwards. Eventually, the truth will come to light. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Yan sent a recent telegram to the Central Government, outlining his personal stance on the Chahar situation. The content is divided into three points: 1. The current path to saving the country lies in stabilizing public morale. To stabilize morale, the army must be reduced in size. Simultaneously, financial expenditure should be based on income. With stable finances, public morale will also be stabilized. 2. The Chahar issue is currently still easy to handle, and should be resolved as soon as possible. 3. He is happy to comply with anything that benefits the country. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Tang Pilen has returned to Shanxi and has explained the Central Government's stance on Chahar to Yan in detail. A telegram arrived in Beiping last night, indicating that he will again represent Yan in Beiping. He will first visit Feng in Zhangjiakou via Datong to gain a reasonable understanding of the Chahar situation. Yan is quite willing to take responsibility for mediating the Chahar situation, but Feng's attitude is resolute.

<p>Fang Zhenwu from Beiping is scheduled to go to Xuanhua from Zhangjiakou today. After Bao Gang's troops were relocated to Nuanquan on the Shanxi border, they have been fully reorganized, with a total of over 3,800 men and over 2,000 rifles. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>A prominent figure from Shanxi in Beiping stated: 1. The presence of the Communist Party in Chahar Province is causing considerable concern for the region. The security of North China in the future</p>
<p>will also be affected. 2. The safety of Chahar Province is of great significance to foreign relations.</p>
<p>Because the Japanese army's Motegi cavalry brigade and the Matsuki 14th Division previously prepared to move from Chengde to Duolun, Shanxi and Sui are connected to the border of Chahar, like lips and teeth. Therefore, they are extremely hopeful for an early resolution of the Chahar situation. Telegrams from the Central Government in recent days have mostly adhered to this principle. At the same time, they are still hoping for a peaceful resolution. Therefore, although the peace movement has stalled, it is not entirely hopeless. How to break the deadlock in the future remains to be seen, pending Yan's final mediation. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Yan in Taiyuan is still at home. He will come to the province as soon as the road is repaired. Zhao Pilen has not yet visited Yan due to road obstructions from continuous heavy rain. The Chahar issue is being discussed with Yan by telegram. Zhao will attend a meeting in Xinxiang at noon on the 8th and then return to Bing.

<p>Since the signing of the ceasefire agreement in various counties east of Beiping, although the Japanese army has withdrawn, puppet troops and bandits have taken the opportunity to rise up.

<p>Regarding the Nanjing government's handling of the Qingdao naval fleet, since the approval of Shen Honglie's resignation, the Executive Yuan and the Naval Authorities of the Military Affairs Commission have consulted many times. They advocate that the Qingdao fleet be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy, and that the existing ships form a fleet stationed in North China. The problem that cannot be solved now is the selection of the future commander of this fleet. It is difficult to make a decision for the time being. It is reported that Song Shishan, Director of the Naval Department of the Beiping Military Branch, Liu Tianfu, Director of the Military Affairs Commission, Zeng Yiding, Commander of the Second Fleet of the Navy, and Xie Gangzhe, Chief of Staff currently responsible for the Qingdao Fleet, may be appointed, but this still needs to be decided by Chairman Chiang. Chen Shaokuan denied delegating representatives to Guangdong to persuade the three ships to return to the jurisdiction of the central government, as the Navy Department has always obeyed the central government in this Qingdao naval incident and has not taken any individual action. Zeng Yiding's trip to Beiping was not to take over the Northeast Fleet, but to offer opinions to the North China Military Authorities. Zeng will depart for Nanjing tomorrow or the day after. Yesterday's report stated that the three ships Yongxiang, Haiou, and Chuyu stationed in Dagu were missing again.

<p>The Tokyo Army authorities believe that the foundation of "Manchukuo" is gradually becoming stable, and plan to complete the Manchurian Incident during the quasi-wartime period within days. If the number of righteous armies decreases during the sorghum flourishing season, it will be completed in October. At the latest, it will be completely completed by March of next spring. Because of the cessation of quasi-wartime actions, heavy artillery shells can be reduced and the temporary allowance can be increased by 10%, and the funds can be saved by 60,000 yuan. However, because "Manchukuo" needs to strengthen its defense, the construction costs have increased significantly, so the financial situation may not change in the end. (Dentsu News Agency, 8th)</p>

<p>The fourth meeting of the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Tokyo saw the Soviet representative insist on the ownership of the railway and demand a selling price of 250 million rubles, which led to a head-on conflict with the "Manchukuo" representative, and the meeting was on the verge of collapse. However, the Soviet delegation in Tokyo has no room for compromise within its authority. Representative Krestinsky toured Atami Beach on the 7th, showing a leisurely attitude. The "Manchukuo" delegation only paid attention to the current attitude of the Soviet side and did not take active action. According to the Soviet side, the Moscow government's response will arrive here next week, and the next meeting will be held around the 12th.

The statement also stipulates guarantees regarding the freedom of Soviet goods and passengers to enjoy transportation on the Chinese Eastern Railway according to convenient terms, and it must be guaranteed that a certain amount of goods transported by the Ussuri Railway pass through the Chinese Eastern Railway.

However, this reform has a great impact on the mobilization plan of the national divisions.

Therefore, it has formulated 14 principles for entrusting provincial governments to handle long-distance telephones in order to seek cooperation between the Ministry and provinces and promote the rapid development of the telecommunications industry, so as to avoid the past competition between state-owned and provincial operations.

<p>(National 8th, Moscow) Since American solo circumnavigator Mattern set off for the second time in Boli on the 12th of last month, there has been no news for a long time. Wireless telegraph has been received and now he is trapped in the remote village of Yanadir in northeastern Siberia, but the telegraph is very simple and does not mention the circumstances of the landing and the current situation. The Russian Air Force is cooperating with the US cruiser Northland to carry out rescue. The Northland came to Russia from the United States and is now less than 300 miles from the Siberian coast.</p>
<p>(Reuters, 8th, Walawalla) Mrs. Mattern received the news that her husband was safe and sound and told a guest calmly that she had been waiting for this news for a long time and was it not strange. She firmly believed that he must be safe and sound because Jimmy (Mattern's nickname) always took care of himself. According to reports, Mattern's flight around the world went smoothly at first, but unfortunately it was interrupted halfway and he went missing on June 12 on his way to Alaska. Yesterday, his flight sponsor in Chicago received a short telegram which read, "Safe in Anadir Chukotka," (in the extreme northeast of Siberia) and was signed by Mattern. It is now believed that this telegram was sent directly from Mattern.</p>
<p>(Reuters, 8th, Moscow) According to news received here today, Mattern was forced to land 100 miles from Anadir Chukotka due to mechanical damage. It took him three weeks to send a telegram from the nearest telegraph office. A coast guard patrol vessel in San Francisco received a wireless telegram stating that Mattern's plane had been completely destroyed.</p>

<h3 id="e47">The Root of Today's Urban Social Problems <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Today's society. Looking at its cities. Towering buildings. Soaring into the clouds. The luxurious images of singing stages and dancing pavilions filled with men and women are enviable. However, upon closer examination of its inner workings, the atmosphere is utterly miserable. Darkness spreads everywhere. It is impossible to live out the day. This is no different in Europe, America, Japan, and China. But it is especially bad in China. If this kind of social phenomenon is objectively analyzed, economic factors are the real cause of its formation. The following two things can be used to prove this.</p>
<p>(1) The Problem of Crime: People are mostly mired in ethical and moral concepts when it comes to the problem of crime, believing that criminals must be born chaotic, born as fierce beasts. Otherwise, they are uneducated people who are ignorant and cannot be reasoned with. Thus, there are so-called acts of encouraging honesty and shame. Thus, there are also so-called severe punishments. However, the sages have said, "Only when food is sufficient do people know etiquette and righteousness." Furthermore, based on the analysis of facts, a total of 16,439 criminal cases occurred in the Public Concession in 1932. The sum of "major property infringement cases" (Category 2) and</p>
<p>"minor property infringement cases" (Category 3) totaled several hundred. The number of kidnapping cases in Category 1 and property murder cases, as well as the use of counterfeit banknotes and counterfeit silver coins in Category 5, "Miscellaneous Crimes," was no less than several dozen or hundreds. As for the other so-called "major personal injury cases" that did not specify the cause of the case, it is not known how many property factors are included. Even this can be determined that many of the cases brought to court are due to</p>
<p>property disputes. And most of the so-called property disputes are caused by economic hardship. This can be further believed by observing the achievements of the police in solving various theft cases in 1932. In that year, there were a total of 12,851 such cases. Among them, armed robbery was 680, robbery was 109, theft was 466, burglary was 632, snatching was 690, ordinary theft was 7,291, and pickpocketing was 983. It can be seen that the so-called criminals who infringe on property are all unemployed and poor people. This is one reason.</p>
<p>(2) The Problem of Suicide: The increase in suicide is a new phenomenon in China in the past decade. Everyone cherishes life and hates death. However, on the Bund and the Wusong River, the number of people who jump into the river and bury themselves in the belly of fish is unknown every day. The number of people who close their doors and take poison alone in a foreign land, or who sleep together as men and women and die in each other's arms, is also unknown. Statisticians list the reasons for suicide, saying "economic difficulties," "loss of love," "degeneration," "family problems," "business failure," "disease," "injustice," "abuse," etc. They are classified into different categories, as if each had its own cause and different nature. However, when pursuing reality, it is all based on economics. Those who commit suicide due to</p>
<p>"loss of love" are mostly related to economics, directly or indirectly. Those who commit suicide because of "injustice" are also mostly related to economics, directly or indirectly. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>From the foregoing, people do not commit crimes because they are born criminals, but because the social and economic environment compels them. From the latter, people do not commit suicide because they enjoy harming themselves, but because social and economic poverty drives them. In today's society, unbearable phenomena emerge endlessly. It is useless for the scholars who are concerned about the times to merely sigh that people's hearts are not as ancient and that the world is getting worse every day.</p>

<p>London The World Economic Conference in its last few minutes, thanks to the salvation of the United States, was saved from breaking down. Now the United States will make the first major contribution to the revival of the conference and put forward a moving labor proposal, including the reduction of working hours, increase of wages, and increase of agricultural prices in all countries around the world. The US delegation is now drafting this proposal and has not yet been fully endorsed by the entire delegation. However, according to the initiator of this proposal today, they now believe that it can be submitted to the conference for discussion in the near future. The conference has been dull and lifeless in recent days, but there are now signs of spring. However, some parties have expressed dissatisfaction, and even resentment, which is inevitable. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London The activities of the delegations to the World Economic Conference today are mostly limited to informal meetings,</p>
<p>preparing for the debate on the new scope of duties of the conference on Sunday. The Steering Group will first listen to the opinions of the Economic</p>
<p>and Currency Committee and then exercise its right to judge its resolutions. Yesterday, all parties expressed</p>
<p>dissent, so the entire issue may be discussed behind closed doors by the Steering Group again. There is currently no credible reason for the rumor that the conference will be adjourned in early August and reconvened in October. The current situation is very uncertain and cannot be predicted. The Gold Bloc still insists on the stability of currency prices, believing that if this is not achieved, other matters will have no results. Dutch Prime Minister Colijn is one of the key figures in the conference. When asked whether the Steering Group will exercise its right to veto the committee's resolutions, Colijn shrugged his shoulders and replied, "Let them try." (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London The Currency Steering Group of the World Economic Conference today passed the British motion with 25 votes against 15. The Currency Steering Group will continue its work. This resolution has caused great surprise among the delegations to the World Economic</p>
<p>Conference. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>London The position of the representatives of the 16 countries in the Steering Group shows that the non-Gold Bloc's proposal to continue the currency events on the agenda without specifically discussing war debts was almost equally divided in the number of votes in favor and against when it was put to the vote on another day. Those who support the continuation of conference affairs are Argentina, Britain, the United States, Canada, China, Japan, and Sweden. Those who oppose it are the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. Russia did not vote yesterday.</p>
<p>Hungary seems likely to join the Gold Bloc, while Mexico will follow the non-Gold Bloc, so the result of this vote will be eight against seven. The Soviet Union will still remain neutral. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Washington President Roosevelt and Acting Secretary of State Phillips, Acting Secretary of the Treasury Acheson, and officials from the Federal Reserve Bank, Baruch, and Davis met twice for a long time before drafting a message to the US delegation in London. Phillips recently returned from London and brought a long message from the US delegation. The US President's message explained the position of the US authorities and used the new situation in London to advocate for the events that the US President considered to be the main goal.

<p>London US telegrams say that the United States is seeking to get Britain to join the plan to raise prices and abandon the Gold Standard alliance. This news makes London feel uneasy. Although Britain is unwilling to change its policy of supporting stable currencies, Britain also does not want to give up its freedom. Although Britain sympathizes with Washington's policy, it is unwilling to give up this freedom at present. This view can be seen in the letter from British Colonial Secretary Amery to The Times. The letter said that the currencies of various countries can currently be divided into three groups, one is the group of Gold Standard countries, one is the US dollar and the various currencies attached to the US dollar, and these two groups are opposed to each other. In addition, the British Empire group is seeking to establish its own banner outside the two. However, Canada is an obstacle to the currency independence of the British Empire, because Canada's financial relationship is closer to the United States than to Britain. It is still difficult to predict whether London will accept the recent proposals from the United States. There is one thing to note, that is, the United States advocates restoring the original parity between the pound and the dollar (that is, the parity before Britain and the United States abandoned the Gold Standard). This is not acceptable to Britain, because no one in Britain is willing to see the value of the US dollar being only four dollars and eighty-five cents per pound. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Currency Stabilization Committee Meeting Results in Two Opposing Factions <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Resulting in a Vote of 25 to 15</p>
<p>Passing Chamberlain's Proposal</p>
<p>To Proceed According to the Original Agenda</p>
<p>Gold Bloc's Protest Proves Ineffective</p>
<p>The London World Economic Conference remains in a sick state, as can be seen from today's meetings of various subcommittees. At the request of the main committee, the subcommittees were to consider matters they could study while the Gold Bloc insisted on suspending discussion of monetary issues. However, the Gold Bloc viewed this as an attempt to undermine their protest and expressed resentment everywhere. When the Finance Committee held an open meeting to discuss constructive stabilization measures, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain spoke of the difficulties of his new job and proposed that the committees proceed with the original agenda without deleting any items listed, but that reservations could be made if unanimous agreement could not be reached. French Finance Minister Georges Bonnet strongly contested this proposal, defending the monetary truce. U.S. representative James Coxon mediated, suggesting that the Finance Committee divide into two groups: one composed of Gold Bloc representatives and the other of non-Gold Bloc representatives. These two committees could work along parallel lines and then summarize their opinions in a final report. However, Chamberlain's proposal ultimately passed by a vote of 25 to 15. At lunchtime, the Gold Bloc held a closed meeting to express their dissatisfaction because their objections were not taken seriously. Therefore, the general atmosphere of the conference could not be considered very good. Meanwhile, conflicts remained in the various subcommittees. During today's meetings, some decided to proceed as usual, while others claimed that meeting under the current restrictive conditions was useless. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>The Currency Committee's Stabilization Subcommittee of the London Economic Conference held a meeting. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain proposed that all issues listed on the agenda be discussed comprehensively. Chamberlain's proposal was then put to a vote, with 24 countries in favor and 15 against, namely Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Spain, France, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. The final decision would still be made by the presidium at a plenary session. The presidium will meet on Monday. Of the 16 countries participating in the presidium, 7 voted in favor of Chamberlain's proposal, 6 against, and 1 abstained, while Hungary and Mexico were absent. There will be no meetings tomorrow. The Currency Subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM on Monday, and the presidium will meet at 11:00 AM on the same day. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>During the meeting of the Currency Stabilization Subcommittee, the opinions of the American and Indian representatives were successively supported by Portugal, Argentina, Ecuador, and Japan. Conversely, representatives from Central and Eastern European countries supported the proposal of French Finance Minister Bonnet to limit the committee's discussions to debt issues, as proposed by Romanian representative Mazaru. After the committee adjourned, there was much discussion in the lounge, with comments stating that the characteristic of this vote was that almost all European continental countries united to confront Britain and the United States, while Soviet Russia abstained.

<p>After the London Currency Stabilization Subcommittee voted 25 to 15 to recommend that the main committee continue discussing exchange rate fluctuations, credit policies, commercial debts, and renewed lending, France and other gold standard countries expressed hope that the U.S. President's economic experiment would end soon. This recommendation will be submitted to the main committee meeting on Monday for a final decision.</p>
<p>France, the Little Entente, and other gold standard countries strongly protested in the meeting, saying that nothing other than commercial debt could be discussed. However, the result of the vote was that the majority of ten votes passed the continued discussion of the issues on the agenda. French Finance Minister Bonnet was not indignant about this result and said it was meaningless because the 24 votes in favor all expressed sympathy for the United States on many issues. He also said that he sincerely hoped the conference would be completely successful, but that before the U.S. dollar was stabilized, it was like building a house on quicksand. No matter how good the opinions, there would be no possibility of a resolution. He added that they would still observe the U.S. President's experiment with attention and sympathy, but hoped it would end soon.</p>

<p>U.S. representative Coxon strongly opposed discussing commercial debt alone at the meeting, stating that it was more important to get the 30 million unemployed back to work than to discuss commercial debt, and that this was the main task of the committee. However, increasing employment should be linked to raising prices. The United States does not think that other countries should adopt U.S. plans to raise prices and can implement their own plans. All plans can be comprehensively adjusted. Coxon also discussed abandoning the gold standard, saying that the United States had only abandoned the gold standard for three months, while many other countries had abandoned it long ago. The United States would not easily give up until all methods had failed. When other countries gained valuable trade positions by abandoning the gold standard, the United States never protested. Finally, he stated that the current differences of opinion among countries on economic events and currency rescue methods could be reconciled. Coxon's remarks were a response to Bonnet's words.

<p>London: Today, France took a brief step of hesitation towards the expansionary policy advocated by the U.S. President, proposing at the World Economic Conference the establishment of another subcommittee specifically to consider public works and other programs to reduce unemployment. The French representative further explained that all public works that can obtain economic rewards can help reduce unemployment, increase demand for goods, and stimulate economic life. It is believed that France's proposal is in response to the speech by U.S. representative Coxon, who yesterday emphasized in the Currency Stabilization Committee that the main task of the meeting was to find work for the world's 30 million unemployed.

<p>Washington: The government has formulated a National Recovery Program, which includes two items: one is to reorganize the entire industry and place it under industrial regulations and export licensing systems, and the other is to implement a large-scale public works program to reduce the number of unemployed. Now the government is forcing various industries to implement industrial regulations. After the regulations are approved by the President, they can have legal effect. As for the cotton industry, regulations have already been formulated, as have more than fifty other secondary industries. However, large-scale mixed industries and agriculture seem to be hesitating. The government claims that all industries that are unwilling to reorganize automatically will be directly subject to complete state control. In addition, the large investment of capital in public works is expected to increase the purchasing power of labor, reducing the risk of imbalance between production and public purchasing power.

<p>Sharpening of Imperialist Economic Conflicts</p>
<p>Russian Newspaper Observes Conference Unable to Achieve Results</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today's Pravda published an editorial entitled "Dancing on the Edge of a Volcano," describing the situation of the World Economic Conference. The article stated that the proposal to adjourn the meeting reported the disintegration of the efforts of various imperialists to find a common solution in a short period of time with their enthusiasm. The newspaper stated, "The result of the disarmament conference was only a new arms race, and this time London has been entangled in financial problems. American imperialists have rejected the proposals of the British and</p>
<p>European Gold Bloc. The conference has broken down because there is no hope of finding a permanent agreement or a shameless compromise." The newspaper concluded, "Attempts to revive the conference or prolong its miserable life cannot hide its actual collapse. The increasingly deepening economic crisis and the rapid preparations for armed conflict will eventually end with the eruption of the volcano and a great war of world redivision. This is the perspective that can be observed at present." (TASS, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Brigadier General Johnson, who is in charge of implementing the National Recovery Act,</p>
<p>expressed his opinion today, saying that the increase in speculative production and price increases in American factories may exceed the purchasing power of the people and cause a new collapse. He asked all industries to quickly stipulate methods to increase wages and reduce working hours. According to the report of the American Federation of Labor, workers' income increased by 7% between March and May, while factory output increased by 35%. The report also stated that the current frenetic activity of factories is mostly speculative. Before workers restore their jobs with wages sufficient for living, various industries should voluntarily</p>
<p>restrict their profits. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>Deng sent representative Zhao Juxu to Chongqing to express obedience to Liu.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Liu Xiang's representative, Fan Chongshi, told reporters on the 8th that Liu had a complete plan for suppressing the Reds and pacifying Sichuan. Recently, a telegram was sent from the Longchang headquarters to Chairman Chiang and President Wang, stating that troops would be sent to suppress the Reds and stop internal strife at the same time. The reason is that the Xu bandits are rampant in Sichuan, but it is difficult to unite to suppress the bandits because internal strife continues. If the Red bandits are not eliminated, there is no way to talk about post-war recovery. Therefore, even without a new order from the Central Government, he should take it as his own responsibility to suppress the Reds and pacify Sichuan. Now that the order from the Central Government has been issued, he will assume office soon and strive to suppress the Reds and pacify Sichuan within the scheduled period to live up to the trust of the Central Government and relieve the people of Sichuan from their suffering. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Liu Xiang telegraphed Deng Mingjie and Fan Chongshi, saying that he had received telegrams from Chiang Kai-shek in recent days, and the intention of the Central Government was already clear. Liu's telegrams to the National Government and Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei on the 4th stated that troops would be sent to suppress the bandits and stop internal strife in due course. This is no different from the proposals of Zhang Qun and Yang Yongtai. The generals of Liu Wenhui's troops are also beginning to realize that things are not difficult. It is expected that the troops sent by this army to eastern Sichuan, such as Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou, will be the general reserve force for bandit suppression. Yang Sen came to Chongqing a few days ago and has consulted in person on joint suppression. Everything is not a problem. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Zhu Lianheng, chief of staff of Yang Sen, said that Liu Xiang's appointment to the new post, gathering the military strength of the entire Sichuan under the banner of bandit suppression, will shift the focus of the civil war. The generals in Sichuan should unanimously support it and break the precarious situation. However, the troops of Deng Xihou and Liu Wenhui are still confronting each other. All parties urgently hope that Liu Wenhui will withdraw his troops quickly and sincerely express his willingness to join forces to suppress the bandits and stabilize the situation in Sichuan. If he does not repent, Liu Xiang's troops to pacify Sichuan will not hesitate to remove obstacles first. In addition, Liu Wenhui's representative in Nanjing said that Liu Wenhui is willing to cede Chengdu to Liu Xiang. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Liu Xiang's representative, Fan Chongshi, said that the rumor that the two Lius have conflicts is inaccurate. Liu Xiang took a vigilant attitude towards Liu Wenhui's troops because Liu Wenhui's re-emergence of war had hindered the work of bandit suppression, hoping that they would realize their mistakes. Liu Xiang is now ordered to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression. From now on, he will concentrate his military strength, and the bandit forces will not be difficult to wipe out. However, the most worrying thing is the anti-tax army in Liu Wenhui's defense zone, because although its name is anti-tax, it is actually led by the Communist Party. The county magistrates in its defense zone who have been killed or expelled are countless. When a large-scale suppression campaign is launched in the future, this anti-tax army must be completely wiped out to eliminate the source of trouble. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The news that Huang Musong has temporarily lost his freedom seems to have been confirmed. Huang's return to Nanjing depends on Gong Bicheng and Peng Zhaoxian arriving in Xinjiang and reporting back before he can be sure. The mission of Gong and Peng is, on the one hand, to report the truth of the incident to the Central Government, and on the other hand, to explain the Central Government's trust to Liu Sheng. The Central Government will issue an order for Liu Shengzhen's removal as soon as it receives Gong and Peng's report and believes that Liu Sheng is sincere and that Huang's return to Nanjing is certain. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The General Staff Department has held several emergency meetings to discuss response measures regarding the second Xinjiang incident. The department believes that</p>
<p>the situation in Xinjiang is extremely complicated recently. Analyzing its contents, the Hui rebellion that trapped the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains is one thing. Sheng and Liu's organization of a temporary government to replace the Jin family is another. Ma Zhongying's attempt to occupy territory and take the opportunity to advance westward is another. Ma Zhongying's troops were defeated by Sheng, but his remnants fled westward to Turpan, and the future troubles may not have ended. Moreover, the disorder in the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains remains the same. Therefore, it is believed that at this time of serious situation, it is difficult to achieve results without seeking fundamental solutions. Therefore, a decision has been made on a method, roughly to divide the north and south routes of the Tianshan Mountains and govern them separately, because the geology and customs of the two routes are different. Now that the situation in the northern Xinjiang has been roughly settled, the Central Government should immediately appoint Liu Sheng to manage military and civilian affairs. The provincial government should select local ethnic groups who have a reputation to participate in provincial affairs and establish a corresponding organization. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Havas dispatch from Budapest, 7th. It is rumored that Hungary and Austria are in negotiations to restore close relations. These negotiations are being conducted by the delegations of the two countries attending the London Economic Conference. The Austrian delegation has submitted a formal proposal stating that Austria supports the Hungarian-Austrian customs union plan, advocating for the expansion of the existing commercial agreement between the two countries. Negotiations between the two sides are based on this proposal. This news has now been officially confirmed by Budapest. The Austrian proposal has been submitted to the Hungarian-Austrian Mixed Committee for review. This mixed committee is responsible for observing the development of commerce between the two countries. The Austrian proposal is largely favored by Hungary. The dispatch also stated, "The signing of the 'Eastern Locarno Treaty' is of no concern to those responsible in Hungary. This treaty only concerns Soviet Russia, as Soviet Russia wants to maintain its freedom of action in the Far East."

<p>National News Agency dispatch from Geneva, 7th. Germany, Japan, and Persia have submitted amendments to the League of Nations Secretariat regarding the British draft of the Disarmament Convention. Most of the amendments proposed by Germany concern troops stationed in distant colonies. According to the amendment, after the conclusion of this disarmament treaty, the troops stationed in colonies by various countries may only be used within the regions of those colonies and only for maintaining public order. Germany believes that within their own territories, countries should maintain reserves specifically for assisting colonial defense forces, and these reserves should also be regarded as colonial troops. The purpose of Germany's proposed amendment regarding colonial troops is aimed at France, fearing that France might mobilize millions of black troops from its colonies in wartime. Japan's proposal does not actually reduce armaments but increases them. Japan is demanding that the maximum caliber of land artillery be increased from 115 millimeters to 155 millimeters. Japan also opposes the provision in the British proposal that countries whose existing armaments exceed the specified maximum levels may temporarily retain them but may not increase them further. Japan is now demanding the abolition of this clause. In addition, Japan is also requesting that the maximum weight of tanks be increased from 16 tons to 20 tons. As for Persia's proposal, it calls for effective management of all arms manufacturing plants and arms trade in various countries.</p>

<h3 id="e89">New Approach to Resolving Chahar Affairs <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Urging Sun Dianying's Troops to Enter Qingdao</p>
<p>Pang and Feng's Troops Ordered to Enter Chahar</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping. Regarding the Chahar affair, the central government repeatedly sent representatives to Zhangjiakou to meet with Feng Qinzhai to discuss a peaceful resolution. The point of contention between the two sides was whether or not Feng would abolish the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. After Feng expressed that it would be difficult to abolish the name in the short term, adhering to the policy of preserving Chahar and resisting Japan, the Beiping authorities felt that the resolution was difficult. They then telegraphed the central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. The reply telegram arrived in Beiping yesterday, advancing the third item in the previous three-item telegram (i.e., making necessary preparations to dispatch Pang Bingxun and Feng Qinzhai's troops to Chahar) to consolidate the Chahar region and prevent communization. After receiving the telegram, the Beiping authorities convened a meeting of generals such as Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, and Feng Qinzhai at Jurentang yesterday afternoon (the 5th). It was decided to continue seeking a solution based on the principle of peace while making necessary preparations according to Chiang's instructions, urging Sun Dianying to leave Chahar from Suileng and enter Qingdao, and ordering Pang Bingxun and Feng Qinzhai to prepare to lead their troops into Chahar for defense. After the meeting, Pang Bingxun invited Hu Jiesan, the representative of Sun Dianying, to his private residence to discuss the matter that evening. Today (the 6th), Mr. Hu returned to Jurentang to meet with He, where discussions were held. The order for the entry of Pang and Feng's troops into Chahar was issued today (the 6th), preparing to concentrate their troops before the 8th. Once Sun's troops have departed, they will enter Chahar to take over the defense and advance forward. It is planned that Feng Qinzhai's troops will first open up Huailai, and Pang's troops will be stationed in the Chicheng Xuanhua area, advancing according to the situation. Since Sun Dianying was appointed as the Qinghai Western District Reclamation Commissioner, he has been preparing everything. However, due to issues such as military pay and departure routes, there have been slight delays. The current authorities have issued the fifth installment of military pay and two months' worth of provisions to the troops as needed for departure. Sun's troops have already decided to assemble the majority of their forces immediately, starting around the 10th to leave Chahar for Qinghai. It is expected that after Sun's troops have left, the defense areas of Sun's troops in the southern part of Chahar Province will be filled by the troops of Pang and Feng, as well as a portion of the central army. At that time, there will be new developments in the Chahar affair. The central government recently felt that the internal situation in Chahar Province was extremely complex, coupled with serious diplomatic issues. If further delays were to occur, they feared that there would be further complications in the future and felt increasingly棘手 (棘手 means thorny or troublesome). Therefore, they plan to resolve the matter as soon as possible. All parties, recognizing the seriousness of the situation in Chahar, are extremely anxious and are also working hard to make a final effort. Although Song Zheyuan feels that the situation is difficult, he still plans to send representatives to Chahar to meet with Feng. He has already telegraphed Deng Zhexi and Li Xin, who had gone to Tianjin, to return to Beiping to discuss everything and prepare to ask Deng and Li to go to Zhangjiakou again. At the same time, Zhao Pilian has arrived at Hebian Village to meet with Yan Xishan to discuss mediation methods. Recently, Yan Xishan will make a considerable statement to make a forceful effort. What the trend will be, in the near future, it might be revealed. (July 6)</p>

<p>To Command the Northern Route Bandit Suppression Military Affairs</p>
<p>And Personally Inspects the Forefront</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence. Liu Zhi, Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression, is unable to spare himself from the important military and political affairs of Henan to come to Jiangxi. Chairman Chiang is personally taking over the bandit suppression military affairs in eastern Jiangxi. Last month, Zhu De and Mao Zedong mobilized their entire forces to attack Yihuang in an attempt to raid Fuzhou. Chiang went to Fuzhou from the provincial capital on the 20th to command everything. When Chiang arrived in Fuzhou, Zhu and Mao had already withdrawn from Shangdun Du, near Fuzhou, to Yihuang. However, the bandit forces suffered heavy losses and retreated south quickly. The Northern Route Army followed suit and arrived in the Kou Kou area south of Yihuang Chongren. Currently, a certain newly arrived Jiangxi unit is rushing day and night to Kou Kou to concentrate and continue to advance. To facilitate nearby command, Chiang has established a headquarters in a certain middle school in Fuzhou and transferred a batch of senior staff from the Nanchang headquarters to work in Fuzhou, in order to make the bandit suppression military affairs easier to progress. According to news from the front lines, Chiang personally inspected Chongren and other places in the sweltering heat, giving instructions to the military officers stationed in those areas and delivering speeches to the officers and soldiers. Now that Chiang is concerned with the rear military affairs and the important party and government relations to be discussed with the central government, and many important representatives from various parties have come to the province to await Chiang's audience, and military representatives have also come to the headquarters to ask for instructions, he will return to the province in the next few days.

<h3 id="e91">The Case of the Theft of Hidden Gold from Kong Geng's Residence <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Hidden Gold in Kong's Residence Was Secretly Buried by the Former Owner</p>
<p>Recently Stolen by Neighbors, Kong Files a Protest</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence. A large-scale theft of hidden gold from the residence of former Provincial Committee Member Kong Geng recently occurred in Wuchang, creating a tense situation. For a time, it became the talk of the town. Since resigning from the Provincial Committee, Kong Geng has been living in Liangdao Street. His residence has another eastern courtyard inside the compound at No. 16 Xiaolou Lane, Liangdao Street. The west side door and the kitchen are between the original foundation of a temple room, with a brick wall built against the wall of the Peng family's residence. The two houses are connected. During the late Qing Dynasty, during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion, a man named Liu Changmao also joined the uprising. Later, he was recruited by the Qing court and surrendered to the Qing Dynasty. He acquired a large amount of gold, silver, and treasures during the chaos. After the rebellion was suppressed, he built houses on a large scale, extensively. At that time, the Qing court, in order to appease the rebels, was very lenient towards Liu and did not investigate deeply. To this day, many mansions and large houses in Wuchang are mostly Liu's legacy, sold by his descendants. The houses inhabited by Kong and Peng were also sold by Liu's family. When Liu was alive, he had a rich store of hidden gold, buried in various places. Because the matter was secret, he lost track of the locations. When he was on his deathbed, he revealed it to his family and instructed them to be careful to find it and not let it fall into the hands of outsiders.</p>
<p>The Peng brothers, the elder being Shisun and the younger being Younan, had heard this story. Recently, it is not known for what reason, they learned that there was a large amount of hidden treasure inside Kong's eastern courtyard. Therefore, using the name of repairing the wall, they secretly dug through Kong's courtyard wall, including the kitchen foundation, at night and discovered the hidden gold, taking it all away. The next morning, Kong learned of this and was very angry and protested. Peng initially denied it, but after repeated questioning, he finally admitted the truth. Peng, realizing that he was in the wrong, asked someone to apologize to Kong and admitted that he had dug up eight hundred ingots of silver, totaling more than four thousand taels, and was willing to return them to Kong for his disposal, to be used for educational and charitable purposes. However, Kong Geng, after surveying the excavated base, saw that the excavation was about seven feet wide, more than four zhang deep, and about one zhang deep. Based on the volume of the pit, he concluded that what they had obtained must be more than one hundred thousand taels of silver, definitely not just this amount. Therefore, he refused to accept Peng's terms. After repeated requests from the mediator, both parties agreed on two methods: (1) Temporarily use eight hundred ingots for educational and charitable purposes; (2) For those that have not been verified to be more than this number, they will be dealt with separately after verification. Later, the Peng brothers suddenly regretted their previous agreement and only offered seven hundred and sixty ingots to Kong Geng to donate to the Sanchu Middle School and other places, and widely published advertisements in various newspapers about the allocation of this money. As for the so-called second step, they were even less willing to give up what had come so easily and did not fulfill it. Kong Geng became even more angry and notified the mediator again, asking Peng to maintain his credibility, otherwise he would have to resort to the courts. The Peng brothers then gathered to discuss how to deal with the situation. According to the mediator, if they did not hand over the silver obtained in this case, they would have no peace. He advised them to offer some more to Kong for handling, but the Peng brothers insisted on refusing and published a notice denying the so-called second step, saying that all the silver dug up had been donated and that Kong Geng should not suddenly fabricate something out of nothing after a long time in an attempt to frame them. Kong Geng responded with a severe rebuttal and prepared everything to go to court.</p>
<p>As for how much silver Peng obtained, some say fifty thousand ingots, some say one hundred thousand, some say three hundred thousand, and some say that there were also gold bars, gold objects, gold leaves, and pearls. Opinions vary. Some say that the house is Liu's legacy, so the hidden treasure should belong to Liu. Liu's family, although they have no definite records due to the long time, are also collecting evidence and say that they already have some clues and will announce the truth soon. At the same time, citizens Sun and Tang of Wuchang, because the Peng brothers' actions were inappropriate, also held meetings to collectively request the authorities to order the Peng brothers to hand over all the hidden gold and use it for local charitable and public welfare purposes. It is rumored that Peng Younan has taken the money to Shanghai (some say to Hunan). Currently, Peng Shisun is facing Kong Geng with false pretenses. In addition to resorting to the courts, Kong has also requested the arrest of Peng, so this case has gradually expanded.</p>

<p>Ten Aircraft Recently Purchased from the United States</p>
<p>American Instructor Killed in Tragic Crash During Test Flight</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence. The Guangdong Provincial Air Force Headquarters, in order to implement its plan to expand the air force, plans to order more than a hundred aircraft in stages to equip the air force squadrons and strengthen its air power. Recently, it has purchased several batches of aircraft from foreign countries, each batch consisting of seven or eight or more than ten aircraft. The first phase of the aircraft purchase lottery issued by the Air Force Headquarters raised more than 400,000 yuan and was used to purchase three fighter planes, which arrived in the provincial capital on the 27th of the previous month. After assembly, they were test flown on the 1st of this month and were named the First, Second, and Third Aircraft Purchased with the First Phase of Lottery Funds. They were assigned to the Second Squadron for use as national defense fighter aircraft. In addition, the Municipal School Air Defense Association recently issued aircraft purchase lottery tickets to students throughout the city. After the conclusion, it raised more than 100,000 yuan. 100,000 yuan was first handed over to the First Army Group Headquarters to purchase an aircraft, which has also been delivered. It is named "Municipal School" and was test flown today. It was also learned that a total of ten aircraft arrived from Hong Kong on the 27th, excluding three lottery aircraft and one Municipal School aircraft, there were also six fighter planes purchased by the government for national defense. After this batch of new aircraft was assembled, the Air Force sent personnel to test the speed and components. At 10:20 AM on the 1st of this month, an American instructor, 士, a senior advisor and flying instructor of the Air Force Headquarters, was piloting a newly arrived fighter plane (biplane, painted silver-gray, valued at approximately HK$180,000) from the Shougouling airfield. Initially, it was intended to demonstrate flying skills during the test flight. Unexpectedly, less than forty minutes after takeoff, after rising to approximately 1,400 feet, just as it was circling the airfield, the aircraft suddenly descended rapidly from the sky as if it had completely lost its ability to maneuver. In an instant, the aircraft crashed next to the aircraft hangar. The entire aircraft was destroyed into pieces. The American instructor's legs were broken, and he suffered severe injuries to the lower body. He died on the spot. Upon hearing this alarming news, the Air Force Headquarters sent personnel to rescue, but it was too late. The Yueguang Funeral Company was hired to inspect and enshroud the body of the American instructor. It was learned that the American instructor, 士, had extensive experience in flying. He had served as a flying squadron leader in the United States. He came to Guangdong to serve under the invitation of the Air Force Headquarters for only three months. Three other Americans came with 士, one teaching aerial bombing, one teaching aerial machine gunning, and 士 teaching aerial reconnaissance. 士's wife is an American movie star. The couple were very affectionate. She only came to China last month and lost her husband in less than a month. She mourned over the body yesterday and fainted repeatedly. It is said that 士's wife has decided to transport her husband's remains back to the United States. The Air Force Department is purchasing a coffin worth 900 yuan for a dignified burial. (4th)</p>

<p>Expanding the Air Force</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Militia</p>
<p>Issuing Treasury Bonds</p>
<p>Wuzhou correspondence. The military and financial situation in Guangxi Province has recently undergone significant improvements. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Guangxi Air Force has been actively expanding recently. In addition to preparing for civil aviation, military fighter jets are being added one after another, and aviation talent is being recruited to expand the squadron. Recently, because the Liuzhou airfield's area is insufficient, the Fourth Army Group Headquarters has sent personnel to Liuzhou to work with the Aviation Office to plan the expansion and build the Air Force Public Office and the residences of the Air Force personnel near the airfield on a grand scale.</p>
<p>The Guangxi Militia is the basic armed force of Guangxi Province. Now that the militia training has achieved results, the authorities are using military law to regulate the militia. The Militia Headquarters was originally under the command of the provincial government but is now directly under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Army Group Headquarters. The militia areas have been reorganized into six major areas. In addition to the original Guilin, Wuzhou, Liuzhou, and Nanning areas, Donglan and Duan counties are assigned to the Liuzhou area, Guode County is assigned to the Nanning area, and Baise and Longzhou areas are reorganized into three areas, with Fengshan, Lingyun, Baise, Enlong, Xilin, Xilong, Fengyi, Xiangdu, Tianbao, Zhenjie, Jingxi, and Zhenbian counties forming the Tianbao area, and Wancheng, Yangli, Longyan, Zuo County, Leiping, Chongshan, Shangjin, Longzhou, Sile, Mingjiang, Ningming, and Pingxiang counties forming the Longzhou area. The area headquarters are located in Baise, Longzhou, and Tianbao.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, in order to consolidate tax revenues and unify the currency system, the Department of Finance plans to issue a kind of treasury national currency bond from the provincial treasury starting next year. This treasury bond has a face value of one national currency yuan per bill, with cash as a reserve fund, and can be cashed at any time. To facilitate the uniformity of revenue and expenditure, all payment of taxes, salaries, military pay, and all public funds can be used. This treasury bond is not registered. If lost or damaged, it will not be replaced. The government may fully recover all of them if necessary. It is said that the regulations for issuing treasury bonds have been approved at the provincial affairs meeting. (June 29)</p>

<p>Disaster Area Spreads to More Than Thirty Counties</p>
<p>More Than Two Hundred Villages Submerged in Lake Areas</p>
<p>Changsha correspondence. Since the beginning of summer this year, Hunan Province has experienced continuous rain and mountain floods. In addition, the huge flood of the Yangtze River flowed back into Dongting Lake, and many embankments in the lake areas were submerged and breached. The severity of the disaster is the same as in 1931. In total, the disaster area reaches more than thirty counties, and more than two hundred villages have been submerged. Hunan Provincial Governor He Jian, in addition to instructing the Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Relief Association to send personnel to the counties to investigate and expedite emergency relief with local officials and gentry, believes that the province has suffered repeated disasters, the people's strength has been depleted for a long time, and the bandit suppression is underway, and the treasury is extremely exhausted. Yesterday, he specially compiled the actual situation of the Hunan disaster and submitted it to the central government, requesting relief to alleviate the suffering. The original telegram read, "Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee, may you be blessed, your benevolent words are beneficial and widespread, I dare not delay. Hunan Province has complex rivers and crisscrossing lakes. Whenever the rivers and lakes rise, there is a risk of embankment breaches. This government, in order to prevent problems before they occur, has already instructed the Department of Civil Affairs to strictly order the counties to strengthen protection and sent personnel to inspect separately. However, since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain for more than a month, and mountain floods have occurred. The Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers have all risen at the same time. In addition, the huge flood of the Yangtze River flowed back into Dongting Lake. Since May 19, according to the Changsha Customs water level marker, the water level has reached more than three zhang, which is almost the same as the water level in 1931. The counties reporting the disaster situation are sending documents in succession, and we are overwhelmed. Now, in summary, the counties with severe damage to houses and loss of life of humans and animals include Hengyang, Chen County, Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Hengshan, Taiyang, Changsha, Xinhua, Liuyang, Anhua, Taoyuan, Sangzhi, Mayang, Baojing, Xupu, Guzhang, Yuanling, Fenghuang, and Tongdao, a total of 19 counties. The embankments that have been breached are in 11 counties, including 88 villages breached in Changde, 51 villages breached and 2 villages submerged in Yuanjiang, 7 villages breached in Hanshou, 8 villages breached and 19 villages submerged in Lai County, 9 villages breached and 3 villages submerged in Nan County, 9 villages breached in Xiangyin, 6 villages breached and 5 villages submerged in Huarong, 10 villages breached in Yueyang, 2 villages breached and 6 villages submerged in Yiyang, 70% of the villages in Anxiang submerged, and 12 embankment breaches in Linxiang. The extent of the disaster and the magnitude of the losses are the same as in 1931. In addition to instructing the Department of Civil Affairs to work with the members of the Provincial Relief Association to rush to the affected counties to conduct a thorough investigation and consult with local officials and gentry to jointly plan emergency relief, and ordering the county magistrates to supervise their subordinates day and night to rescue, this province has been suffering from repeated disasters, and is also in the midst of bandit suppression. The treasury is exhausted, the officials are hungry, the people have been exhausted for a long time, and there are starving people everywhere. Now that this great disaster has come, we can only sigh with regret. I, Jian, am serving as the governor and have encountered a year of misfortune. I am heartbroken and exhausted. I can only present my insignificant words, hoping for the grace of saving lives. I am moved to tears, and I pay my respects to your benevolence. He Jian, Governor of Hunan Province, bows and seals," (July 4)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Academia Sinica to Excavate Ancient Relics in Linzi <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Searching for Items from Before the Zhou Dynasty</p>
<p>Planning to Start Work After the Autumn Cooling</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence. Linzi County in Qingzhou Province is the ancient capital of the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period. Duke Tai was enfeoffed in Yingqiu, which is located here. Although the era is far away this year, the remains can still be faintly seen. Shang tripods, Zhou pans, Han tiles, and Qin bricks are often discovered by woodcutters and shepherds. After excavating the Yin Ruins the year before last, Academia Sinica decided to continue excavating in Shandong because the Qi capital of Linzi is of great importance to Chinese culture. Fearing that they would not have a clear idea of where to begin, they first excavated the ancient capital of the State of Tan in the Spring and Autumn period near Longshan Town in the east of Jinan as a trial.</p>
<p>The results were good. Academia Sinica then decided to realize its Linzi excavation plan this year. Recently, Dong Zuobin was first sent to Linzi to conduct a field investigation. Dong returned to Jinan yesterday. According to his talk, the most famous ancient site in Linzi is the ancient city of Qi. There are two ancient cities. The outer city is forty li in circumference and was built later by the State of Qi. The inner city is the old site of Yingqiu, and the remains of the city walls still exist. In addition, there are ancient tombs such as those of Tian Dan and Yan Ying, which are related to ancient culture. Academia Sinica has decided to go to Linzi this autumn to excavate the ancient city of Yingqiu first, with the greatest purpose of searching for items from the Stone Age before the Zhou Dynasty. Because the items discovered in Linzi after the Zhou Dynasty are not unique, the pottery shards and mud seals discovered on the ground are all from later periods. However, no Stone Age items have been discovered so far. If nothing is found in Yingqiu City, they will excavate the outer city. If nothing is found in the outer city, they will have to excavate elsewhere, because the locals say that there is another Yingqiu City elsewhere. It is difficult to judge where the real Yingqiu is. As for other ancient tombs, they plan not to excavate them for the time being. The reason is that the tombs of Tian Dan and others are said to have been robbed long ago, and the academy has adopted the principle of "work if possible, preserve if not." They are especially unwilling to hastily excavate tombs. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Shen Honglie's Political Achievements <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Overview of Qingdao City in the Past Year</p>
<p>People from All Walks of Life Actively Urge Him to Stay</p>
<p>Qingdao correspondence. Since the news of Shen Honglie's resignation came out, people from all walks of life have been urging him to stay, because Shen's political achievements in Qingdao are quite remarkable. Looking back on the year and a half that Shen has been in charge of Qingdao, the city's construction projects include the construction of Pier No. 5, which cost 4 million yuan, the construction of the Xiaogang Shipyard, which cost nearly 300,000 yuan, and the completion of the Qianhai Pier and the Huiquan Sports Field, which cost more than 200,000 yuan each. The expansion of roads has made it possible for cars to reach dozens of miles outside the city. In addition, Qingdao City is often plagued by the influx of Changshan water in the summer. Shen ordered the Public Works Bureau to actively cover the sewer pipes to prevent flooding from now on. With regard to fire prevention, in view of the fact that someone was careless last year, resulting in the burning and death of seven people due to the burning of the staircase, Shen ordered all wooden stairs in the city to be rebuilt as cement stairs, to be completed within one year, and the reconstruction is underway. As for public security, robbery has not been seen for several months, and the police have been able to be honest and diligent. Other achievements include increasing the number of schools to prevent children from dropping out of school and building hundreds of houses for civilians in the east and west ridges, benefiting the poor. Recently, he has also been planning to establish an agricultural and industrial bank to relieve the difficulties of the common people. These are all his achievements. Shen usually treats naval soldiers very well, but is very strict with officers. The recent assassination attempt on Shen by Feng Zhichong was caused by the seduction of two or three unscrupulous officers. The rumor that Shen intercepted military pay is completely false. The people have telegraphed the central government and the Beiping branch to urge him to stay. The elders and representatives of the people went to the city government the day before yesterday to earnestly ask Shen to dismiss his intention to resign. However, Shen's intention to resign has not been dismissed. Therefore, the people of the city will hold a city residents' conference on the 8th to make a large-scale effort to urge him to stay.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Sichuan Army's Chaotic War Begins <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Liu and Deng's joint attack on the north of Chengdu intensifies; many 24th Army generals advocate for Liu Wenhui's resignation.</p>
<p>Xu's bandits and Tian's army are locked in a stalemate; anti-tax forces rise up like swarms of bees.</p>
<p>Representatives of Sichuan's various institutions and legal groups appeal for peace.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After Liu Xiang issued a telegram proclaiming his aim to unify Sichuan and eliminate the Red bandits, he advanced to Longchang and deployed military forces. The situation between Qianwei, Jiajiang, Renshou, and Jingyan suddenly deteriorated. Liu Wenhui was particularly determined to seek revenge and personally went to Jiading to command. He specially appointed Xiang Yuren as the rear guard commander, stationed in Chengdu. He then dedicated his main force to the southern front. The second major conflict between the two Lius is about to begin. When Liu Xiang departed for Longchang, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, and Yang Sen all sent liaison officers to accompany him. All armies would obey his orders. Liu Xiang, now the leader of the alliance, was full of confidence. He ordered his troops to concentrate at designated locations, awaiting the order to launch a general offensive. He also telegraphed Deng Xihou to attack from Pihe and requested Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, and Yang Sen to focus on defending key fortresses to prevent bandits from advancing south. Upon receiving Liu's telegram, Deng was greatly encouraged. On the 2nd, he advanced to Jintang and launched a major counter-offensive against the 24th Army. Fierce battles have been raging in the Ban Zhuyuan and Zhaojiadu areas for days. The 24th Army, as an isolated force, struggling to support both north and south, felt overwhelmed. Except for the army commander Liu Wenhui, who remained stubbornly resistant, determined to make a desperate stand, many of his generals wanted to preserve their strength and were unwilling to sacrifice. A few days ago, Liu convened a military meeting in Chengdu, where Chen Hongwen, Wang Yuanhu, and Peng Fu all suggested that Liu temporarily step down to ease tensions from all sides, indicating the perilousness of their situation. Amidst this chaotic war between the armies, anti-tax forces rose up like swarms of bees in various counties. The magistrate of Qionglai County has already been arrested and killed. Xu Xiangqian's bandit forces are particularly rampant. According to various reports, they have already occupied seven counties and are continuing to advance south. They have also ordered He's bandits in western Hubei to quickly infiltrate southern Sichuan and establish contact. The official sources only acknowledge the loss of Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and Guangyuan counties and claim that Tian's army has recovered Guangyuan. Attempting to defeat a formidable enemy with exhausted troops and hastily claiming to have recovered lost territory will not be so easy. On the 5th, a gentleman traveled from Chengdu via Chongqing to Hankou. According to him, the Red bandit forces are expanding daily. Tian's army is currently holding the line along the Cangxi, Yilong, and Guangyuan rivers, confronting the bandits but have not yet launched a counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Representatives from various Sichuan provincial institutions and legal groups, including Zeng Jian and 1,900 others, issued a joint telegram appealing for peace, deeply saddened by the resurgence of Red bandits and the outbreak of internal war. The original text is recorded below: "Since the great war last year in Sichuan, the people have suffered terribly and been displaced, beyond description. Unexpectedly, before their shock has subsided, war has broken out again. If circumstances permitted and the war was justified, the people could temporarily endure it. But now, the Red bandits are rampant, like a raging tide. Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and other counties have been lost and then regained. Guangyuan, Cangxi, Yilong, Langzhong, and other counties have successively fallen. Bandit gangs everywhere are again raising red flags, engaging in arson and looting. Danger lurks on all sides, and perilous situations abound. Last year, the military leaders put forward a plan for governing Sichuan. The people hoped that the end of the internal war would allow its implementation. But the armies' words and actions contradict each other, becoming even more extreme, levying exorbitant taxes and focusing their attacks on the people, thus creating opportunities for the Red bandits. If they urgently change course and work together to suppress the bandits, it might not spread beyond control. But instead, they turn their weapons against each other, as if bearing deep hatred, focusing on internal strife and abandoning the responsibility of suppressing bandits. They call it 'unifying first and then suppressing the Reds,' but in reality, unification may not be achieved, and the Red scourge is spreading like wildfire. The 70 million people of Sichuan are trapped in an irrecoverable situation. Moreover, if the armies were to unanimously suppress the Reds, supporting each other and moving from disunity to unity, it would be an excellent opportunity for the unification of Sichuan. Ignoring this and engaging in internal strife, how can they excuse themselves from the condemnation of their conscience? Jian and others, with their remaining years, are alarmed by the impending disaster. Therefore, we tearfully implore fellow countrymen across the nation to provide assistance and rescue, and earnestly request the Central Government to send special commissioners to Sichuan immediately to effectively stop the Sichuan war, strictly order all troops to focus on suppressing the Reds, and cooperate fully to achieve complete success. Perhaps the dying people of Sichuan will have a chance to survive. Otherwise, the entire province will fall to Red control, causing even more harm than in Jiangxi. If the Red bandits gain this strategic region, the disaster will spread to the entire nation. If attempts to recover are made only then, it will be too late. The situation is urgent, and we hereby express our lament. We hope you will consider it. Respectfully, Zeng Jian, Xu Jiong, Pei Gang, Xu Xiaogang, Yin Changheng, Chen Guodong, Peng Guanglie, Du Wenyuan, and 1,900 other representatives from various institutions and legal groups in Sichuan."

More than 20 people attended, including district chief Zhong Taishi. Zhang Shaoxiu, as chairman, reported on the process of convening the meeting. After discussion, all agreed that this year, instead of establishing a separate epidemic hospital, a new ward of the hospital should be designated as an epidemic department, with a branch outside the West Gate, to provide swift medical care. The expenses are temporarily set at 1,000 yuan. The hospital will prepare a donation registry and submit it to the county government for sealing and distribution for fundraising. It was unanimously approved to officially open on the 20th of this month. The hospital will immediately begin preparations.</p>

<p>The Wuxi Rice and Bean Industry Association held a joint executive and supervisory committee meeting on the 20th of the previous month, resolving to change the existing 0.99 discount for agency sales of various businesses to 0.984 and setting July 1st as the implementation date. However, businesses in the Beitang and Huangniqiao sections strongly opposed this, while the Sanliqiao section absolutely supported it. Both sides went to extremes, and no agreement could be reached. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the association convened a general meeting of members of the eight sections. Chairman Zhao Zixin presided over the meeting, resolving the following: 1) The case of the dispute over changing to a 0.984 discount was reviewed and passed as originally planned. 2) There are many obstacles to using the new system of weights and measures, and a postponement is requested. 3) Regarding the provincial order to ban brokers to eliminate harm to farmers, each section should submit a written opinion to the meeting for review and transfer. 4) Nineteen preparatory committee members were appointed to prepare for the re-election of executive and supervisory committee members. 5) The case of levying customs duties on imported food from abroad to prevent dumping should be submitted to the Jiangsu Ninghu Municipal and County Rice Industry Association for forwarding to the central authorities for approval.</p>

<p>The Nantong County Education Bureau levies a marine product education tax in Lusi on the Yellow Sea coast.

The Provincial Government has ordered the County Government to immediately suspend the tax.</p>

<h3 id="e109">General Li Du Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Will Rest Briefly in Shanghai Before Going to Beijing and Jiangxi to Report</p>
<p>Expresses a Thorough Determination to Resist Japan and Not Take Any Position, Details Retreat from Russia, Will Host Reporters Today</p>
<p>General Li Du, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army and a stalwart fighter against Japan, accompanied by his secretary Liu Xubo and interpreter Liu Guanren, returned to the country aboard the Italian postal ship Conte Verde from Venice, Italy. The ship arrived at the port at 12:45 p.m. yesterday and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Representatives from all sectors of the city went to welcome him. Mr. Li stated that he would rest briefly in Shanghai before going to Beijing to report to the Central Government on his anti-Japanese experiences and that he would host the press at 2 p.m. today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Welcome from All Sectors)</p>
<p>Those who went to the port to welcome him yesterday included Li Dachao, Section Chief of the Municipal Government; Xie Chuanda, Director of General Affairs; Hu Haishan, Captain of the Water Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau; Dong Pingyu, Deputy Inspector General; Wu Huanzhang, representative of Ma Zhanshan; Wang Erzhan, representative of Su Bingwen; Zhou Weitai, former Director of the Industry Bureau of Heilongjiang; Pu Bingshan, Xu Haiting, Lang Guanpu, and Jiang Songnian, officers from the Ma and Su units; Li Yulin, younger brother of General Li; Ye Jiaxing, of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Zhu Xuefan, of the General Labor Union; Chen Yafu and Chu Huiseng, of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association; Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Chen Binghui, Wang Hesong, Liu Zhongying, and Zheng Dongshan of the First Special District Citizens' Association and various branch associations; and over a hundred newspaper reporters.</p>
<p>(Arrival Situation)</p>
<p>The Conte Verde entered the port at 11 a.m. yesterday and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong at 12:45 p.m. The Municipal Government representative Li Dachao and the Public Security Bureau Deputy Inspector General Dong Pingyu and others took the Public Security Bureau ferry from Pier No. 10 in Nanshi at 12:00 noon to welcome them. The other welcoming representatives from various organizations took small passenger ferries from the Jianghai Customs Pier to Pudong. After General Li Du shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel and reporters on the ship, he and the Municipal Government representative Li Dachao took the Public Security Bureau ferry, disembarking at the Nanshi Guanqiao Pier at 2:05 p.m. and took a car to the China Hotel on Guizhou Road to rest. The Public Security Bureau sent a water patrol team to guard the Qichang Wharf in Pudong and a police brigade to guard the Nanshi Guanqiao Pier.</p>
<p>(Li's Demeanor)</p>
<p>General Li is 53 years old, wearing a light gray suit. He is burly, his hair is already gray, but his spirit is very strong. He is humble in attitude and expresses many emotions. Accompanying General Li this time are his secretary Liu Xubo and interpreter Liu Guanren, as well as Liu Piguang, Wang Ziyao, and Jiang Ying, his representatives stationed in Shanghai, who came from Shanghai to Hong Kong to welcome him. Wang Delin is still in Hong Kong and did not come with them.</p>
<p>(Anti-Japanese Experiences)</p>
<p>General Li met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship yesterday. According to him, he fought against Japan in the Northeast for thirteen months, from Harbin to Mishan. He experienced more than a hundred battles, large and small, and held eight counties for more than eight months. Currently, a part of his troops is still remaining in hiding in Jilin Province. Recently, they occupied four counties, including Mishan, Baoqing, Hulin, and Raohe. Dongning has also been occupied by Wang Delin's forces.</p>
<p>(Reasons for Retreating to Russia)</p>
<p>On January 6th of this year, I was stationed in Mishan City, commanding my troops. There was a fierce battle about 160 li near Mishan. On the 8th, the enemy troops used 117 armored vehicles to detour to the rear of our army, launching an attack, causing us to be cut off from both the front and the rear. I led a company of guards and broke through the encirclement. Seeing that the situation was dire and there was nothing I could do, I reluctantly retreated into Russian territory on the 9th.</p>
<p>(Six Months of Travel)</p>
<p>From the time I left the country to the time I returned, it took a total of six months. I stayed in the Soviet Union for three months. My nerves became abnormal due to stimulation, so I was accompanied by medicine every day. Then I went to Berlin for medical treatment, staying for half a month. Later, I went to Rome to recuperate for a month. The rest of the time was spent traveling. The troops who retreated into Russian territory with me have all returned to the country via Xinjiang, totaling about 7,000 people. They are currently stationed temporarily in Xinjiang Province, guarding the border.</p>
<p>(Impressions of European Travel)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's first five-year plan has been successful, and the second five-year plan has already begun. The people's lives are quite difficult, but they are working extremely hard on construction, which is admirable. German Chancellor Hitler is highly trusted and respected by the people of the whole country. Members of the National Socialist Party are all over the country, and the swastika symbol is everywhere. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is truly a patriot. I met with him in Italy. Italy's construction in the past ten years has progressed rapidly, thanks to Mussolini's efforts.</p>
<p>(Meeting with Zhang)</p>
<p>I met with Zhang Xueliang many times in Rome. Zhang has decided to stay in Rome for three months before going to other countries for inspection. Zhang's body has now recovered, returning to the state it was in before 1925.</p>
<p>(Ding Chao Captured)</p>
<p>General Ding Chao, with his indomitable spirit, fought to the death with Japanese and puppet troops. During the battle in Baoqing, because General Ding refused to retreat, he was eventually captured by the Japanese army. He was first sent to Harbin, and then to Changchun. When I arrived in Russia, I heard that the puppet organization had issued an amnesty order and intended to reuse General Ding. But General Ding ultimately refused to be lured by benefits and expressed his refusal. There was then talk of his being harmed. To this day, news is silent, but whether the rumors of Ding's death are true has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>(Future Actions)</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Tanggu Truce, the anti-Japanese military affairs have come to an end. My return to the country this time is to handle the aftermath. As for my anti-Japanese stance, it remains unchanged. I will rest briefly in Shanghai before going to Beijing to report to the Central Government on my anti-Japanese experiences. Then I will go to Jiangxi to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In the future, I plan to come to Shanghai to recuperate and do not want to take any position. Most Chinese people value their personal lives and property more than the country and the nation. I deeply hope that the Chinese people will correct their mistakes in the future and always put the country and the nation first, and catch up quickly, it is not too late.</p>
<p>(Ma and Su Visit)</p>
<p>After Mr. Li arrived at the China Hotel at 2:40 p.m., Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen visited him and left after talking for about ten minutes. At about 3 p.m., General Ma Zhanshan visited with Zhang Dianjiu, and General Su Bingwen also arrived soon after. They exchanged detailed opinions on the issue of post-war arrangements for their subordinates. Ma, Su, and others did not depart until after an hour.</p>
<p>(Banquet Last Night)</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others hosted a banquet for Mr. Li at their residence in Haig Road at 7 p.m., and invited Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen to accompany him. At that time, toasts were made and songs were sung until about 9 p.m., when the gathering dispersed in joy.</p>
<p>Mr. Li plans to stay in Shanghai for a week and then go to Beijing to report everything to the Central Government. He will then go to Jiangxi to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on his anti-Japanese experiences. Mr. Li has also scheduled a meeting with reporters from various newspapers at the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road at 2 p.m. today to report on his detailed experiences in the war against Japan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Newly Appointed Hubei Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun Reluctantly Accepts Position <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Will Go to Take Office in Mid-Month</p>
<p>Will Go to Beijing in the Coming Days to Consult on Everything</p>
<p>The newly appointed Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Zhang Qun, is currently staying in Shanghai and plans to go to Beijing in the coming days to consult with the Central Government on everything. He will be able to go to Hubei Province to take office in mid-month. According to Mr. Zhang, he told visiting reporters that the Central Government had firmly requested him to take the position of Chairman of Hubei Province,</p>
<p>Because Yu Cai was unable to overcome, he had to refuse to refuse. He had to reluctantly take on the task for the time being, but hoped that the Central Government would select another capable person to replace him as soon as possible. During his term of office, he would promote the pre-determined policies of the Central Government, so that the people of Hubei Province could recover slightly after the bandit disaster. As for the candidates for the Provincial Committee and the heads of various departments, the Central Government should determine them. It is expected that the names will be announced at the Central Political Conference next Friday. There will be very few changes in the candidates for each department. He will go to Beijing in the coming days to consult with the Central Government on everything, or may turn to Jiangxi to pay respects to Chiang Kai-shek, and will go to Hubei Province before the 20th of this month. The long-term impact of the Red bandits and floods in Hubei Province has made it difficult to carry out reforms in the provincial departments. The total tax revenue of the province is only about 400,000 yuan per month, or only five or six million yuan per year, which is not as much as the revenue of Shanghai City. The monthly expenditure is close to one million yuan, and the Central Government now provides a monthly subsidy of 600,000 yuan, which is enough to offset the revenue and expenditure.</p>

<p>Ye Weiheng and his wife, Shi Weikang and his wife, Chen Ruiji, Shi Ruizhen, and Chen, wife of Xu Bingli, principal of the Sanbao Chinese School, and three others from the Meilida Overseas Chinese Youth Association in Java, Dutch East Indies, organized the Java Industrial Inspection Group to return to the country to learn about the state of industry in their ancestral land. They arrived in Shanghai on the Italian Conte Rosso last month, on the same ship as Generals Ma and Su. They then went to Hangzhou and Nanjing to visit various scenic spots and pay respects to the Mausoleum of the Premier. They returned to Shanghai a few days ago. In recent days, they were accompanied by the Nanyang Culture Department of Jinan University to visit major factories in the city for on-the-spot inspections. The inspections have now been completed. They had originally planned to go to Beiping and other places, but due to time constraints, they have been cancelled. All the materials obtained from the inspections have been sorted, classified, and compiled. In addition to being published daily in the Nanyang Xing Bao, they are also preparing to report to overseas Chinese on various islands about the achievements of industry in their ancestral land, so as to provide assistance. It is learned that Ye Weiheng and the other seven people boarded the Dollar Steamship Company's Hoover yesterday morning to go to Japan and other places to inspect the state of industry. They will then return to Java via the Philippines. The Red Cross Society of China and the Nanyang Culture Department of Jinan University each sent personnel to the wharf to see them off.</p>

<h3 id="e119">The Silk Factory Labor Dispute in Zhabei Was Fully Resolved Through Mediation Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Disturbances Still Occurred in the Sixth District Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Both Parties Signed Five Resolution Terms</p>
<p>The Labor Union Announced That Work Would Resume Uniformly Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Since the strike at the silk factories in the Fourth and Sixth Districts of Zhabei on the morning of the 5th, the factory owners and workers have failed to hold close negotiations for days. As a result, there have been several instances of resumed strikes after work had restarted. Meanwhile, a group of unemployed female workers have been causing disturbances everywhere, pressuring factories that have already resumed work to not work before a practical solution is achieved. This has led to unwarranted disturbances in the silk factory area for days. Fortunately, the police stations and police brigades in each district have been making great efforts to suppress the unrest, preventing any disasters. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties for mediation, which resulted in a satisfactory outcome. The original plan was to resume work today (the 9th), but because it is Sunday, factories typically have a day off, so it was decided that work will resume uniformly tomorrow morning. The events of yesterday are described below:</p>
<p>(Situation in Each District Yesterday) In the Sixth District of Zhabei, the silk factories were disturbed by female workers from the Wu Xing and Hong Da silk factories on the afternoon before yesterday, and they were unable to continue working and had to stop work again. Yesterday morning, the Sixth District Silk Weaving Industry Association still sent personnel to the factories as usual to advise the workers. At the same time, the Fourth Squadron of the Public Security Bureau and the police of the Fourth District also went out to protect the factories in front of the factory gates. As a result, the workers of each factory entered the factory to work one after another. Unexpectedly, the female workers of the Mao Feng and Qian Yuan factories on Changan Road suddenly started a disturbance, inciting all the female workers to stop work and leave the factory, and smashing the glass windows of the factory buildings. The factory had no choice but to stop the machines and let them go out. The female workers then swarmed to other factories that had already started working and shouted, firmly ordering them to strike and take uniform action. Although the police and the labor union tried to stop them, it was still ineffective. As a result, female workers from factories on Changan Road, Hengfeng Road, Meiyuan Road, and Gonghe Road were forced to leave the factories and strike again. The Fourth Squadron of the Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, quickly dispatched a large number of armed police to suppress the unrest at key intersections and ordered the female workers gathered in various places to disperse in batches. Unexpectedly, the female workers gathered again and swarmed to the Dayang Bridge and Tanziwan areas to cause disturbances. Fearing incidents, the factories automatically stopped work. As for the factories in the Fourth District, they remained temporarily closed during the day, and the sirens were not sounded. The female workers scattered in their homes, so the order was very good. Police officers were sent by the Public Security Bureau to guard the gates of the factories. The Zheng Feng and Yun Cheng factories were repairing their machines, and the situation was very quiet. As for those who were not affected by this incident and continued to work as usual, there were seven in the Sixth District: Hong Yu, Tian Sheng, Sheng Feng of Yan Jiage on Liuying Road, Mao Li of Tanjia Bridge, Xing Lun, Yu Feng of Gujia Bay, and Heng Cang of Miaotou. In the Fourth District, only Fu Lun Heng and Shuang Gong factories continued to work, and others in the concession areas also worked as usual.</p>
<p>(Mediation Officially Established) The Social Affairs Bureau specially convened a mediation committee at 10:00 AM yesterday to conduct mediation. The attendees included Huang Jinfan and Zhang Peishen from the Silk Factory Industry Association, Yang Gengti and Chen Xiu Pu from the Third, Fourth, and Sixth District Silk Weaving Industry Unions, and labor union supervisors and directors Le Xiaorong, Yuan Yunlong, Wu Suzhen, Liu Sanbao, Yan Aizhu, Yang Shumei, Chen Lianxi, Gu Xiaomei, Chen Yundi, Wu Xiubao, Pan Jingqiu, Wang Genbao, etc., and Fan Guoren from the Municipal Party Department's People's Training Section. The meeting was chaired by Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Third Division, and Wang Zhiqin recorded the proceedings. First, the chairman announced that the labor side had requested the restoration of wages and benefits, and the bureau had sent personnel to investigate. Now, they have convened to conduct mediation, hoping that both parties will be open and honest so that they can jointly discuss solutions. The labor side stated that they are proposing to restore the wage to six jiao, the Sunday bonus to three jiao, the "shen gong" to four jiao, and to fulfill the previously agreed-upon treatment clauses. The capital side stated that there are 103 silk factories in the city, and less than half of them are currently open. Some of the leased factory bases are only for three months or six months and are temporary in nature. The labor side has suddenly gone on strike without following legal procedures, and it is inevitable that they have been incited by third parties. The factories are well aware of the workers' suffering, but they hope to cooperate with labor and capital and appropriately increase wages, but only for a period of three months. After repeated persuasion from the chairman and long-term consultations, the agreement was signed at 1:20 PM, and the mediation was completed. The mediation record was signed on the spot, stating that the right dispute party, for wage and other disputes, was convened by this committee for mediation, and both parties agreed to sign the following agreement: (1) The wages of all silk weaving female workers in the city will be restored to 4 jiao 5 fen from June, and the rest will be inferred. (2) The Sunday reward is 2 jiao per week, limited to July, August, and September (three months). (3) "Shen gong" is two "gong" per month, for both male and female employees (one "gong" for ten days, two "gong" for eighteen days). This will be temporarily set for three months, and if the market situation is the same as it is now after three months, it will continue to be issued. (4) The silkworm moth subsidy for employees will be issued monthly according to the usual salary, with a subsidy of 2 jiao per yuan. This will be temporarily set for three months, and if the market situation is no different from the current situation after three months, it will continue to be subsidized. (5) Workers from striking factories will be persuaded by the labor union to work as usual on the morning of the 10th of this month. This case has been agreed upon by representatives of both parties, and the signing of the mediation is deemed to be a collective agreement between the parties to the dispute (see the list of signatures above).</p>
<p>(Labor Union Announces Resumption of Work) The Third, Fourth, and Sixth District Silk Weaving Industry Union yesterday issued a notice to all workers stating that, regarding the issue of restoring treatment, this union has joined with other district unions to request the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate and resolve the matter. The main points of the clauses are extracted as follows: (1) The wages of female workers in the workshop will be restored to 5 jiao, and the rest will be inferred. (2) The Sunday reward is 2 jiao per week, limited to July, August, and September (three months). (3) "Shen gong" is two "gong" per month for both male and female employees. One "gong" for ten days, two "gong" for eighteen days. If you ask for leave for one day, deduct one "gong," one and a half "gong" for one and a half days, and two "gong" for two days. This will be temporarily set for three months, and if the market situation is the same as it is now after three months, it will continue to be issued. (4) The silkworm moth subsidy for employees will be issued monthly according to the usual salary, with a subsidy of 2 jiao per yuan. This will be temporarily set for three months, and if the market situation is no different from the current situation after three months, it will continue to be subsidized. The above items have been formally signed and it has been decided to start the car to work as usual next Monday. Please all workers go to the factory on time and as usual to work, and do not stay on the way. This is the most important thing. This notice is hereby given. July 8, 1933. At the same time, the three agencies of the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau jointly issued a notice and posted it everywhere.</p>
<p>(Dispatching Police to Protect the Start of Work) The Silk Factory Industry Association yesterday notified its members that, in accordance with the mediation record of the Social Affairs Bureau, the Fourth and Sixth Districts of Zhabei will sound the sirens to start work uniformly on the morning of the 10th of this month. The Public Security Council decided to send additional armed police officers tomorrow morning to protect female workers from entering the factory to resume work in the silk factory areas such as Tiantong Road, Tianbao Road, and Hengfeng Road, and to prevent rioters from inciting workers. The Social Affairs Bureau will send cadres to various places to prevent the riots. The Third, Fourth, and Sixth District Silk Weaving Union decided to set out today and tomorrow morning with all the supervisors and directors to advise the workers and explain the situation. (Bailout of Detained Workers) During the labor unrest a few days ago, the Fifth Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau detained seven workers who threw stones and caused trouble: Gao Xiaowuzi, Chen Shuying, Zhao Di, Xiaowuzi, A'san, Wuzi, Chen A'er, and so on. In addition, Shen Xiaozuanzi was arrested when he was released from work the night before last. The sub-bureau prepared a document and transferred him to the main bureau for questioning. During yesterday morning's mediation, the labor side requested that all detained workers be released. The Social Affairs Bureau expressed its acceptance and promised to notify the Public Security Bureau that the labor union would be allowed to bail them out. Subsequently, the labor union prepared a document and requested the Public Security Bureau to release them.</p>

<p>Meeting with Chairman Ma to Report Everything</p>
<p>Representative Li Mingxin Accompanying Him</p>
<p>Pu Bingshan, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Army of Heilongjiang, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. A reporter from the Northeast News Agency visited him at his residence. He said that he heard General Ma had returned to China and the whole plan was waiting to be discussed in person, so he disguised himself and took a risk in Yingkou in late last month, took a boat to Ping, and originally planned to wait in Ping to meet Chairman Ma to report on the combat and the resettlement of his troops. Later, because Mr. Ma was delayed in Shanghai, he took his representative Li Mingxin to come south. After getting off the train this morning, he went to see Chairman Ma and talked in detail for a long time. General Ma expressed his condolences. He was particularly concerned about the many soldiers in various parts of the Heilongjiang Province who were in distress. Later, Commander Zhang Dianjiu also came to visit, and the conversation continued for a long time. He left with Mr. Ma in the same car. According to Pu's talk, the Four Friends who came to Shanghai with Ma, his Heilongjiang Infantry First Brigade, was the tough Solun army of Zou Zuohua's reclamation. Last year, they fought for several months in Keshan, Baiquan, Nehe, Tai'an Town and other places, giving the Japanese invaders a major blow. Because the artillery regiment of his troops was originally led by Zou Zuohua, they fought with the Japanese army at Nenjiang Bridge Sanjianfang and were well-known. Later, under my command, they encountered the enemy in Baiquan and other counties, and they had the courage to fight head-on, and the Japanese puppet army regarded them as a strong enemy, gathering several brigades to encircle and suppress them. In the end, our army ran out of ammunition and was cut off from reinforcements, and finally suffered a disastrous defeat. Now they are still disintegrating into parts, lurking in various places, waiting for an opportunity to launch.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Issued a Public Notice Yesterday Declaring the Mortgage Rights of the Arsenal <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Has the Responsibility to Legally Eliminate Improper Infringements</p>
<p>Any Private Sale Is Invalid According to Law</p>
<p>Regarding the mortgage rights of the Shanghai Arsenal base, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a public notice yesterday, stating that in 1925, the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the government, transferred a loan for the purpose of handling the dismissal of defeated soldiers and transporting supplies. With the approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Army at that time, the base of the factory was used as a mortgage, and when the relocation of the factory was implemented and the base was sold, all land prices would be used to repay the principal and interest of the aforementioned loan first. The deed of the factory base and the guarantee letter from the old Ministry of the Army were held as proof. Upon the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce, all the rights and obligations of the former General Chamber of Commerce were legally assumed by the Chamber of Commerce. In May 1929, the current Ministry of Finance also presented a proposal to the Executive Yuan to maintain the original plan, and ordered the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to be informed. According to the above circumstances, the Chamber of Commerce has the responsibility to legally eliminate improper infringements in the implementation of mortgage rights after the factory relocation is implemented. If someone sells the land privately, resulting in damage to the rights, it will be invalid according to law. It is hoped that both the grantor and the grantee will pay attention. This notice is hereby given.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Unprecedented Grand National Silk Exhibition Opens Today <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation Leads to Expanded Exhibition Space</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Die Inaugurates the Event at 1 PM</p>
<p>The China National Silk Exhibition will officially open at 1 PM this afternoon. All preparations and arrangements have been rushed to completion overnight by the preparatory office of the exhibition, in conjunction with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Merchandise Exhibition Hall and the National Products Market. The venue and exhibition space are extremely grand. Details are as follows: (A Glimpse of the Venue)</p>
<p>The main venue is the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's assembly hall, the largest public gathering place in Shanghai, with a capacity of over 3,200 spectators upstairs and downstairs. After three days and nights of decoration, it appears even more magnificent and spacious. At the entrance of the venue, banners proclaim "Promote National Silk, Recover Rights," and "Relieve People's Livelihood." On the large columns beside the banners are two couplets written by Wang Xiaolai, Vice President of the exhibition: "Five-colored patterns, joyfully become brocade embroidery; Seven-fold materials, greatly expand the plan;" and "Seeking others is not as good as seeking oneself; self-reliance to seek self-strengthening." Facing the entrance is the speaker's platform, with a large banner reading "China National Silk Exhibition" hanging in the center. To the left, it says, "Adopting foreign goods is economic suicide;" to the right, "Only national products can stop the leakage." Above the platform is a warning: "China is already impoverished and exhausted; people who are intoxicated by imported goods, wake up quickly!" On both sides are "Consolidating silk industry financial institutions is indirectly supporting the silk industry;" and "The industrial and financial sectors should unite to promote national products." Under the platform is a slogan: "The exhibition is to leave a lasting and profound impression on the public." (Exhibition Condition)</p>
<p>At the entrance of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Merchandise Exhibition Hall, a decorative archway is made of pine branches, with the nine characters "China National Silk Exhibition" made of electric lights. After entering the main gate, large paintings depicting national suffering are hung along the road, alarming viewers. There are also slogans about promoting national silk, pasted all over the walls. Beside the iron gate hangs a couplet: "National clothing, please come in; foreign clothing, roll out," which is straightforward and pleases the viewers. (Expanded Exhibition)</p>
<p>The exhibition space was originally set in the third floor of the Exhibition Hall, with a total of 115 display cases of three types: A, B, and C. Unexpectedly, before the 6th, the number of display cases required by the registered manufacturers had already exceeded 150. After the 6th, more manufacturers continued to sign up to participate. Therefore, the original location was insufficient. The Exhibition Hall managed to vacate part of the fourth floor, adding 54 display cases, for a total of 169 display cases, the largest scale since the National Silk Exhibition began.</p>
<p>(General Overview of Decoration)</p>
<p>After the manufacturers spent the entire day of the 7th decorating, forty to fifty percent of the displays were completed by noon on the 8th. The remaining fifty to sixty percent required all-night work on the 8th due to the temporary addition of electric lights. At noon on the 8th, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency made a preliminary tour, seeing that the entrance to the exhibition hall was the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank office. Winding inward, the new products of the Wah Sun Dyeing Factory were beautiful and eye-catching. Next was the exhibit from Yue Chang Wen Factory in Hangzhou, followed by the exhibit from Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory. The "驻　縵縐" brand was innovative and added color to the entire venue.</p>
<p>Next was the exhibit from Mei Wen Silk Weaving Factory, with over ten photographs of silk weaving machines, providing a general view of the silk weaving industry at a commercial exhibition. Next was the exhibit from Zhen Hua Factory, followed by the exhibit from Xing Ye Factory, featuring "风行葛", "绮香锦", "虹影縐", and other products, perfect for summer needs. Next was Jin Yun Factory, with models of national silk clothing for reference. At the exit were Ta Sun Silk Store and Wah Wah Silk Company, whose displays were the most beautifully arranged, like a lingering farewell, making people reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>(Venue Program)</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the first day of the exhibition. The venue program is scheduled as follows: 1) 1:30 PM, Ms. Hu Die cuts the ribbon; 2) 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, speeches by famous people; 3) 3:00 PM to 3:15 PM, piano solo by Ms. Zhang Zhiyuan; 4) 3:20 PM to 4:00 PM, national martial arts demonstration by the National Martial Arts Hall; 5) 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, new play by Hua Dong Girls' High School; 6) 5:00 PM to 5:30 PM, national music by the Da Tong Music Society; 7) 5:30 PM to 6:00 PM, magic show by the Postal Workers' Union; 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, film screenings, including "Aviation to Save the Nation" and "Mysterious Little Detective" by the Star Film Company, "Opening of Mei Ya Silk Factory and Silk Industry Bank," and "Shanghai Special Police Parade," etc.; 8) After 7:00 PM, Peking Opera by the Shanghai Business Association.</p>
<p>(Police Sent to Maintain Order)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the silk exhibition will be held for three days from the 9th to the 11th of this month, and requesting that police be dispatched to maintain order at the venue. The letter instructs the relevant Fifth District</p>
<p>Chief to comply and dispatch police to protect the venue, and a corresponding reply is sent.</p>

<p>Specializing in the Sale of Enemy Goods, A Slight Warning</p>
<p>The Pharmacy Reports to the Police for Investigation</p>
<p>At 9:20 PM the day before yesterday, a man of about 30 years old, wearing a white short shirt and pants, suddenly threw a paper package at the counter of the Pacific Pharmacy at 119 North Szechuan Road (Yokohama Bridge). The man then calmly left. When the paper package was opened, it was a bomb, with an attached warning letter. All the staff were alarmed. It is reported that the store owner presented the original letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhabei Fifth District Headquarters, and the General Bureau Inspectorate, requesting an investigation. The warning letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"Pacific Pharmacy, be informed! We have found that you are privately dealing with the enemy, selling a large number of enemy goods disguised as silk, deceiving the public. It is truly hateful! You are Chinese, how can you not know that 'September 18th,' 'January 28th,' and the three northeastern provinces have been occupied by the enemy? Our team has discovered your extremely evil behavior, disregarding the loss of the country, only seeking profit, and using economic means to assist the enemy. We hope you wake up quickly and seal up and clear out the enemy goods. Now we are giving you a small gift as a warning. If you continue to be stubborn, we will take drastic measures against you, etc." The letter also has a drawing of a pistol, a knife, and a human heart. The letter is stamped with a triangular seal, engraved with "China People's xx xx xx xx xx (these five characters are unclear) Special Task Force."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Wen Ying's Mother Appeals Against Diao Ao Ke <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Seduction First, Murder Later</p>
<p>Request for Compensation for All Losses</p>
<p>Since the female physiognomist Wen Ying was murdered by her lover Fan Hongsheng, the police arrested Fan, and he was sentenced and imprisoned in the Tilanqiao Western Prison. The deceased's mother, Huang Wu, believed that her beloved daughter's tragic murder was caused by her teacher Cheng Meixian (i.e., Diao Ao Ke) and Cheng's wife Ling Qing, as well as Feng Mengyun, the editor of the Da Jing Bao. Last month, she filed a criminal complaint against the three, accusing them of offenses against public morals. The First Special District Court concluded the initial trial, finding the evidence insufficient and acquitting Cheng and the others. This has been reported in previous newspapers. However, Huang Wu insisted that Cheng Meixian seduced her daughter first, then incited her murder, that Cheng Lingqing induced her daughter to prostitution, and that Feng Mengyun was an accomplice. All these facts were the cause of death. She could not accept the initial trial's acquittal of the three and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, requesting the original verdict be overturned and a thorough investigation be conducted to redress the grievance. She also argued that her daughter had completed her apprenticeship and was able to support her in her old age. Since she was murdered, the defendants should be ordered to compensate for all losses. Yesterday, three judges from the Second Branch of the High Court, Zhao, Zhou, and Jiang, formed a collegial panel to hear the case, with Judge Zhao serving as the presiding judge. First, they asked the appellant, Huang Wu, about the purpose of the appeal. Because she could not afford to hire a lawyer, she recounted in detail the circumstances of her daughter's encounter with Cheng Meixian (Diao Ao Ke) in Hangzhou. Cheng saw that her daughter was beautiful and, using the pretext of teaching her photography, lured her to Shanghai. Later, she came to Shanghai to see her daughter.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Largest Morphine and Red Pill Operation in the French Concession <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Secretly Manufactured on Rooftop Terraces at Night</p>
<p>Workers Suspended Up and Down with Thick Hemp Ropes</p>
<p>││ French Police Conduct a Thorough Search and Arrest Eight People ││</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published a news item titled "Large-Scale Neighborhood Search Last Night." At about 10 PM the night before last, the French police suddenly mobilized all Chinese and Western detectives on duty and surrounded Zhengjia Muqiao Street near Avenue Edward VII. They arrested more than ten men and women. Until about 2 AM yesterday morning, Chinese and Western detectives were still stationed at the entrance of the alley. Upon hearing the news, a reporter personally went to investigate. Seeing the detectives guarding the entrance, the situation seemed very serious. In addition, the newspaper was about to go to press, so the reporter hurriedly returned to the office to write the story. However, it was expected that the case must be significant. It turns out that Zhang Zonghan, a Ningbo native, started his career by dealing in white goods and morphine. His main manufacturing operation was originally located in the International Settlement, but due to strict searches, he could not gain a foothold. He moved to No. 15 Bulinli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession. The house is a three-story building with three rooms on top and three rooms below. He used the rooftop terrace and hired craftsmen to build four main rooms on the roof, installing motors and machinery. Every night, he secretly manufactured morphine and red pills. To avoid being seen, the workers used thick hemp ropes for going up and down instead of stairs. The mechanism was extremely ingenious, but it was eventually discovered by the special investigation officers of the French police, Jin Jiulin, Yao Jinfu, and Su Shichi, etc. At 10:15 PM the night before last, they led chief detective Zhang Ziying, detectives Wang Zhihao, Xue Youlin, Zhu Judong, etc., along with Western Chief Detective Xiao Peishi (transliteration) and Western Deputy Detective Xiang Tuolai (transliteration), etc., to the address. They charged straight to the third floor, climbed up the rope, and found the rooftop operation brightly lit. The workers were working on the manufacturing. On the spot, they arrested Yu Jinfu (27 years old, Ningbo native), Zhou Xuewen (32 years old, Yixing native), Ye Ronggen (32 years old, Ningbo native), Fei Xiangfu (28 years old, Ningbo native), Wang A'er (32 years old, Tongzhou native), Jiang A'si (37 years old, Tongzhou native), Wu Mingsheng (42 years old, Ningbo native), and seven others, as well as a Ningbo woman, Chen Li (28 years old), downstairs, for a total of eight people. The main culprit, Zhang Zonghan, happened to be out and was not caught. Twelve bags of raw morphine materials were confiscated. The search was completed by dawn. The police first took Yu and the others to the police station, then sent detectives to guard the operation and hired craftsmen to dismantle the machinery. The total value of the confiscated machinery and raw materials is estimated at about 100,000 yuan. This is the largest morphine and red pill operation broken in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent Yu and the others to the Second Special District Court for investigation. At 3 PM, Criminal Division Chief Wang Wangxu took the bench in the Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, stated that the police had not yet investigated the case and that the main culprit was still at large. He requested a postponement and that the defendants be detained temporarily pending a detailed investigation and the arrest of the main culprit, before filing a lawsuit. Detective Wang Zhihao then reported on the circumstances of the raid and the arrest of the defendants, and presented the twelve bags of morphine to the court. The court verified the report and questioned the defendants before ordering a postponement until the 15th for further questioning. The defendants were returned to the police station for detention. × × × × × ×</p>

<p>Special Task Force's Firearms Confiscated</p>
<p>Provincial Authorities Have Dispatched Personnel for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Xianyi, the fourth district chief of the Jiangsu Maritime Provincial Public Security Team, dispatched a special task force to suppress bandits and protect fishermen and merchants because sea bandits had repeatedly robbed fishing boats in the Huaihai area. He also established a commercial vessel identification flag for identification and ease of inspection. All legitimate merchant ships could obtain the flag free of charge. Now that the fishing season is over and the sea is calm, the fishermen and merchants are grateful for the protection provided by the task force. The other day, as the task force was preparing to return, it was reported that Shen's troops were distributing flags and ordering merchant ships to pay fees to obtain them. However, the boat owners, because they had the protection of the maritime police, refused to comply. Shen's troops resented the task force and argued with them. At the time, the sea was rough, causing the patrol boat to damage Shen's troops' boat. Shen's troops became even more resentful and confiscated the task force's firearms. After the incident, the task force immediately flew back to the district headquarters to report. District Chief Zhang, considering the seriousness of the case, immediately telegraphed the provincial department to report. Yesterday, the provincial authorities dispatched personnel for a thorough investigation to verify the facts and handle the matter accordingly.</p>
<p>× × × × × ×</p>
<p>It was learned that it was not to learn photography, but under the pretext of physiognomy, she was taken by Lingqing to a hostel to prostitute herself. After Cheng's seduction, Feng followed. He requested that Cheng be punished for offenses against public morals and offenses against the family.</p>
<p>When questioned, Cheng Meixian only admitted to having a physical relationship with Wen Ying. Cheng Lingqing denied inducing her to prostitution and claimed that she divorced Cheng Meixian as soon as she learned of his inappropriate behavior. Feng Mengyun claimed that he only asked Wen Ying for photos to publish in the tabloid and had no other relationship. The court stated that the case still needed investigation and adjourned for further questioning.</p>

<p>Mr. He Xufu, a cultured general, has a passion for antiquity. Over the years, while stationed in the outskirts of Qin, Jin, Zhi, and Yu, he made every effort to collect antiquities. Therefore, his collection of fine works is vast. He has previously held public exhibitions in Beijing and Hangzhou, but only a part of his collection was shown, and viewers were already amazed. This time, through Mr. He's entrustment to the son of Jin Gongbo, Qian'an, his collection of stone carvings, bronzes, ceramics, etc., totaling over 1,300 pieces, has been transported to Shanghai. Many are rare items, especially the ten or more Buddhist statues from the Six Dynasties, Wei, and Qi periods, which are the most exquisite. Their patterns and designs are simple and magnificent, and they are extremely complete. There are also hundreds of ceramics from the Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song dynasties, which are an unprecedented sight. Now, Shanghai archaeologists are requesting Mr. Jin to hold a public exhibition, which he has agreed to. It is expected that these precious items will soon delight our eyes.</p>

<p>Last month, Feng Mengyun and other members of the Shanghai literary and art circles initiated a summer excursion, inviting one or two hundred well-known people from the community to Minhang for a day of fun. Now, Mr. Feng and the group, including Ding Song, lawyer Qu Shaoyi, etc., are organizing a second summer excursion. The location is set in Gaoqiao, Pudong, where the coast borders the East China Sea with a flat expanse of white sand. Wading through the sand, the water only reaches the knees. The sand is clean and clear, and the water is gentle. Looking up, the sea and sky stretch for thousands of miles, boundless and limitless, enough to wash away the dust. Taking the ferry from the Bund pier in Shanghai, it takes only one hour to reach. The municipal government recognizes the area as an excellent place to escape the summer heat. Last year, it specifically opened a beach resort, and many Chinese and foreigners go there on weekends for recreation. This year, Mr. Yang Hongkui and others have built a seaside garden hotel in the area, with new-style Western-style buildings, tall and spacious. They have also planted flowers and trees, excavated ponds, built a golf course, and set up a luxuriously decorated dance hall. The facilities are as good and beautiful as can be, allowing the ladies of Shanghai to adjust their bodies and minds on weekends after a tiring week of work. Now, Mr. Yang, together with Mr. Feng, Ding, Qu, and others, have agreed on a method to invite Shanghai ladies to tour. It has been decided that from 9 AM to 10 AM today, they will gather at the Bund pier and take the city ferry to Pudong. After arriving in Pudong, they will take a car directly to Gaoqiao. Upon hearing the news, major businesses in Shanghai have been sending gifts to help with the fun. Yicheng Company sent ten dozen bottles of Yantai beer, Yili Soda Company donated twenty dozen bottles of Yili soda and twenty dozen bottles of Kerles fresh orange juice, Guanshengyuan confectionery and pastries five hundred servings, China-Western Pharmacy donated three hundred packets of Hongshentan, three hundred bottles of Star Flower Dew perfume, and three hundred exquisite round fans.

<h3 id="e140">County Slaughter Tax Contract Bidding <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Appeal from the Minhang Preserved Fresh Food Industry Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, which states in brief: "It is found that the term for contracting the slaughter tax in the county expires at the end of July this year. In accordance with the regulations, bidding should be carried out first to increase educational funds. It is scheduled to set up a bidding box in the county government hall on July 12 for merchants to submit bids. The public should be widely informed, and bidding vouchers should be prepared in advance for merchants to collect and submit bids. The names and tax amounts of the merchants with the highest bids should be reported for verification. In addition to the supervision of committee member Wu Jiaxu, it should be notified to all," etc. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Cao announced to the merchants in the county that the slaughter tax for this term would also include a special construction donation, which is one-quarter of the regular tax. The Minhang Preserved Fresh Food Industry Association of Shanghai County sent a letter to the authorities stating: "To the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office and the Shanghai County Government, We respectfully submit: It is found that since the county's</p>
<p>slaughter tax has been contracted through bidding, contractors, for the sake of personal gain, do not hesitate to increase the bid amount to achieve the purpose of contracting. The increased bid amount, as well as salaries and public expenses, are all based on the authority to collect from meat merchants. The winning bidder does not need to compensate, and the burden on the meat industry becomes heavier, while the contractor's income becomes more abundant, and the suffering of the meat industry deepens.</p>
<p>The contractor's profits are therefore thick. It is found that the towns in the county are completely rural market gatherings. The prosperity of trade is based on the amount of consumption by farmers. In addition to the continuous years of drought, they have also suffered from the impact of cheap sales hurting farmers. The rural economy has fallen into bankruptcy, and farmers' expenses are shrinking everywhere, especially fresh meat, which is at the top of the list of savings. Trade is sluggish, and they are losing money. The two-year slaughter tax has been contracted by people outside the industry who do not know the actual plight of meat merchants. The bid is huge, and they do not consider whether the meat industry can bear it. It is now heard that this year's slaughter tax has a minimum amount of 3,800 yuan and is scheduled to be bid on July 12. In order to avoid exploitation by contractors and relieve the suffering of meat merchants, the industry association, in accordance with the precedents of the Shanghai city, still bids at a low amount, or in accordance with the previous year's Ding and Chen bid amount, is responsible for recognizing and handling the bid, fairly distributing the burden, and each district painfully pays it, eliminating the contractor's ambition and extortion, reducing the pain of the meat industry's extra burden. There is no need to worry about any shortfall in the special education fund. As for cash deposits and guarantee procedures, etc., once instructions are received, they will be paid in accordance with the regulations. The date of payment will be determined separately by representatives who will collect and deliver on time. The urgent telegram is infinitely sincere and awaiting orders. During the industry's request period, please postpone the bidding temporarily. If a contractor bids a huge amount, the extra tax should be borne and reported by the bidder himself, and the industry association will never recognize it. This is all stated together.

<p>Important Evidence Under Rigorous and Strict Investigation</p>
<p>Many Key Witnesses Currently Not in Shanghai</p>
<p>│Police Station Rushing to Prepare Statements for Reference│</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao, the former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was assassinated at 9:00 AM on April 29th, 1930, in front of the company's gate. Subsequently, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested several perpetrators, who were convicted by the Shanghai Local Court. Recently, on the 1st of this month, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station arrested Zhou Zhizhang (also known as Xuan Si), a key suspect from Anhui province in this case, and Ge Wenqing and Gong Wenjiang, also from Anhui province, who were robbery suspects, at the Xian Shi Amusement Park. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Later, Wang Shuqiao and Hong Yaodou, both from Anhui province, were apprehended. Wang is a current lawyer with an office on Route Sapey in the French Concession. It was revealed by Zhou that Wang had a significant connection to the Zhao assassination and other cases. Therefore, the police station arrested him. However, at the time, the police station needed to rigorously pursue the main culprits, so this newspaper did not publish the news. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the case was currently under rigorous investigation. Evidence related to this case was not entirely in Shanghai, some being far away in Nanjing and other places, making collection quite difficult. Additionally, many key witnesses were not in Shanghai, making it impossible to proceed with the case today. All defendants had written statements, but the police station's copies were not yet prepared and needed to be referenced, so they could not be presented to the court. He requested a postponement, stating that the evidence could be presented at the next hearing. Judge Qian reviewed the report and, finding that the case had not been thoroughly investigated, granted the police station's request and ordered a postponement for further review. The defendants were returned to custody. It is reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau will also send detective team leader Gao Wansheng to the court today to request the transfer of the case, but because the case did not proceed, the official documents were not submitted.</p>

<p>Result of Consultation between the Association and the Tax Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai North Branch of the Municipal Tobacco and Excise Industry Association previously reported that members of the trade were alarmed by the tax bureau's implementation of increased autumn taxes on tobacco and alcohol licenses. Since the Shanghai war, the market has been sluggish, and commerce has declined. If taxes are increased, the burden will be unbearable. It was resolved that all tax payments should be sent to the association and presented to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for safekeeping, pending a solution. Now, according to the results of consultations between the association and the responsible parties of the tax bureau, the tax rates of the previous quarter will remain in effect. The office has already notified its members, instructing them to take their old licenses to the bureau to pay taxes without delay. The license dispute has now come to an end.</p>

<p>Tenants' Association Negotiates with Both Parties</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, the Hengtai Lane area of Zhoujiazui, Hongkou, suddenly had its water supply cut off by the Shanghai Waterworks Company yesterday, causing panic among the tenants in the lane. They immediately reported it to the Tenants' Association, which sent representatives such as Wang Shoushen to negotiate with the company. The company's representatives stated that the landlord, Hengtai Company, was more than six months in arrears on water bills. In order to maintain operations, the company had no choice but to take this measure, so the representatives should negotiate with the landlord. The representatives immediately phoned the landlord to question them and demanded that they pay the water bills immediately to avoid further disputes. However, the landlord, Hengtai Company, claimed that the water bills had suddenly increased and that they had no funds to pay. The issue remained unresolved. The representatives had no choice but to renegotiate with the waterworks company, requesting a postponement of the water cutoff so that tenants who had paid their rent and water bills would not suffer. The company agreed to do so but stated that the landlord must pay the water bills within five days; otherwise, the water cutoff would continue. The representatives expressed their satisfaction. That evening, an emergency meeting of all tenants was called by the Tenants' Association in the lane. It was decided that: 1) Representatives such as Wang Shoushen would directly negotiate with the landlord, demanding that they pay the water bills immediately; 2) Each household would be levied three yuan to cover the costs of negotiation, which would not be refunded; 3) Letters would be sent to the Municipal People's Association, the General Tenants' Association, and party and government organs, requesting assistance; 4) Legal counsel would be hired. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Ministry of Industry Promises Relief</p>
<p>According to the Xinmin News Agency, rickshaw worker representatives from Shanghai West, Zhu Jinrong and 30 others, recently petitioned the Ministry of Industry for relief. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau had notified rickshaw merchants in January to manufacture new vehicles and register them with the bureau. The bureau then issued 3,000 new vehicle licenses but restricted their operation to the four areas of Shanghai West: Pu Song, Cao Jing, Fa Hua, and Zhen Ru. Before issuing the licenses, the restricted routes were not announced, causing significant losses to the workers' interests. The Ministry of Industry replied yesterday, stating, "Received the petition. We have sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government for investigation and handling. You are hereby notified."</p>
<h3 id="e146">Various Industries Urge Retention of Stamp Tax Salesperson <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The highest sales figures for stamp tax in Shanghai are in the 4th and 5th districts of the Special District, with Western restaurants and hotels contributing the most. Initially, stores in the concessions were hesitant to affix stamps, but sales gradually increased due to the encouragement of salesperson Ms. Wen Yongshu. She maintained amicable relations with various merchants. Her sudden dismissal by the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for reassignment has greatly surprised many merchants. Therefore, the Western Restaurants, Hotels, Candy, Biscuit, and Tea Food Associations have jointly sent letters to the Ministry of Finance, the Taxation Department, and the Stamp Tax Bureau, earnestly urging her retention. The letter stated: "To whom it may concern, we, the members of our associations, have learned that Ms. Wen Yongshu, the stamp tax salesperson for the 4th and 5th districts of the Special District, has been ordered to be dismissed and reassigned. Our members are greatly surprised. The stamp tax has not been implemented in the concessions for long. At the beginning, the emphasis was on encouragement. Over the past five or six years, thanks to Ms. Wen's hard work and earnest encouragement, merchants gradually complied with affixing the stamps, leading to increased sales and sufficient tax revenue. The authorities should commend her to show appreciation for her hard work. Instead, she is being dismissed, which our members find incomprehensible. We request that you promptly send a letter to the authorities, earnestly urging her retention, to avoid losing a virtuous public servant who fosters cooperation between officials and merchants." It further stated that since Ms. Wen assumed office, she has worked diligently and selflessly, maintaining her integrity and never engaging in corruption. She has earned the trust of merchants, and the widespread adoption of stamp tax in the concessions is indeed due to her efforts over the past five or six years. Now, the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Excise Bureau is not only failing to reward her but also dismissing her, which greatly alarms the business community. For the sake of the country's tax revenue and the merchants' trust, we hereby earnestly request that your department order the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Excise Bureau to immediately rescind its order and safeguard national taxes. The nation will be fortunate, and the business community will be fortunate. We hereby inform you and hope you will investigate accordingly. Respectfully submitted to Director Xie of the Taxation Department, Ministry of Finance."</p>

<p>The Public Shanghai Hospital Opens an Epidemic Department as Summer Arrives</p>
<p>Epidemics are rampant, spreading, and causing great harm. There are few hospitals specializing in the treatment of epidemics in southern Shanghai. Now, the newly built contagious disease ward of the Public Shanghai Hospital at the Santai Wharf in the South City specializes in admitting epidemic patients for isolation and treatment at very low cost. The poor can receive free treatment. The Epidemic Department is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month, with dedicated physicians employed to provide round-the-clock diagnosis and treatment using the latest methods. It is also reported that the hospital has acquired a new ambulance. If families wish to use it, they can call the hospital, and a vehicle will be dispatched.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Epidemic Hospital Reopens</p>
<p>The Jiangwan Epidemic Hospital was destroyed by Japanese artillery fire during the January 28th Incident last year. It has been learned that the hospital has now received 3,000 yuan from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau from the war zone relief fund and over 1,500 yuan donated by the Xin Sentai Shenji Construction Company for construction expenses. All the new buildings have been completed, and the opening ceremony was held yesterday. The internal equipment is complete, reportedly with the full support of local gentry such as Cai Xiangsun.</p>

<p>│Deceased Had Elderly Father, Situation Extremely Tragic│</p>
<p>Zhu Ronghai, 41 years old from Haimen, lived at 29 Yaojiazhai Bridge, Zhabei. He had an elderly father to support. Zhu earned a living by cutting hair for people along the road. His daily income was meager, resulting in an extremely impoverished family situation. At approximately 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Zhu was walking alone along Gordon Road and Avenue Road, from east to west, intending to cross the road when a soldier named Si Dai Ai (transliteration) of the United States Marine Corps stationed at 50 Haifang Road, was driving motorcycle number 1876, speeding from south to north. Unable to avoid the collision, Zhu was knocked to the ground and suffered severe head injuries. A Chinese patrolman with badge number 2989 witnessed the incident and immediately reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched investigators. The injured man was sent to the Red Cross Hospital, where he died. The body was taken to the Philan Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. During the inquest, Si Dai Ai testified that he was driving north along Gordon Road, and the deceased was walking east to west. The deceased had already crossed his vehicle when another car approached from the north. Seeing that car, he walked back, and he was unable to stop in time, causing the collision. Zhu Chunjin, the father of the deceased, testified that he only had one son, whose livelihood he depended on. Now that he had been killed, he did not know what to do. He intended to transport the body back to his hometown, but he had no money to pay for the coffin. He broke down in tears, his situation being extremely tragic. After hearing the testimony, Guo ordered an examination of the deceased, Zhu Ronghai, confirming that he had died from head injuries sustained from being struck by motorcycle number 1876. The body was sent to the Pushan Villa for storage.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Continued Trial of the Huge Robbery Case Involving 120,000 Yuan <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The major robbery of 129,080 yuan occurred at the entrance of Yong'an Fang on Xin Yong'an Street in the French Concession at 5:00 AM on the 16th of last month. Jin Jiulin, a supervisor from the French Concession Police Special Agency, and others, successively arrested the robbers Wang Maojian (aka Wang Rongchang), Zhang Weicai, Li Along (aka Scarface Along), and suspects Xu Wangshi (Wang Maojian's concubine), Zhang Yushi (Zhang Weicai's mother), and Huang Bosheng, six men and women in total. They recovered 46,675 yuan in stolen cash, which was sent to the Second Special Court for investigation. Arrest warrants were issued, with the approval of the French Police Department, for the remaining robbers: Da Luosong (aka Jiang Gaiyuan), Atu, Abao, and Patrolman Lao Si.</p>
<p>The previously arrested Wang Maojian and the other five individuals have been investigated by the police. It was discovered that Wang Maojian had committed a robbery in the Public Concession on June 3, 1926, and was sentenced to five years in prison. Zhang Weicai had also committed a robbery in the Public Concession on November 2, 1927, and was sentenced to three years in prison. Li Along had also committed theft and other crimes. All were repeat offenders. Yesterday afternoon, Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, heard the case in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, presented the case, stating that the investigation revealed that the robbery was initiated by the two fugitives, Atu and Lanpiyan, who gathered the second, fifth, and sixth defendants, Wang Maojian, Zhang Weicai, and Li Along, and the fugitives Jiang Gaiyuan (aka Da Luosong) and one unknown accomplice. They met at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the morning of June 16th and decided to rob the large sum of money that the plaintiff Zhao Zhangyun was transporting from Wenzhou to Shanghai. Li Tu and Lanpiyan identified the car hired by the plaintiff and the old wooden box containing the money. They followed the car to the corner of Xin Yong'an Street on the Bund, where Jiang Gaiyuan (aka Da Luosong) and the other robbers used guns to intimidate and stop the car. The second, fifth, and sixth defendants seized the old box containing the money. Afterwards, they went to room 224 of the Da Shanghai Hotel at 348 Tianjin Road to divide the loot. The police are prosecuting the three robbers currently in custody, Wang Maojian, Zhang Weicai, and Li Along, for robbery with weapons by a group of three or more people under Article 348 of the Criminal Law. The police request that they be tried according to the law. The police have found that the first, third, and fourth defendants, Xu Wangshi, Zhang Yushi, and Huang Bosheng, are not related to the case and propose not to prosecute them. The police request a ruling on this matter. The police also presented the 8,475 yuan in stolen cash found in the homes of Xu Wangshi and others, as well as the receipt and guarantee of 38,200 yuan in stolen cash previously claimed by the plaintiff's representatives. Subsequently, the plaintiff's representatives, Xu Jinqing, Wang Xingshi, and Weng Laike, along with their attorney Yin Rubo, requested that the defendants be strictly pursued for the remaining unrecovered stolen money and that they be allowed to claim the stolen cash in custody. The court, after reviewing the statements, ordered the police to take down Xu Wangshi and the other two defendants, as the police were not prosecuting them. The three robbers Wang, Zhang, and Li were questioned separately (their statements were the same as before and are not recorded). The court then ordered the start of the debate, with the police lawyer and the lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Fan Gang, hired by the defendants, exchanging arguments. The court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 15th. The defendants were returned to the police station. Xu Wangshi, Zhang Yushi, and Huang Bosheng, who were not being prosecuted, were ordered to be released. The 8,475 yuan in stolen cash held by the police was ordered to be handed over to Zhao Zhangyun upon verification.</p>

(B) Propose a research outline on a certain science or propose important questions or theories published in a certain famous work to stimulate discussion. (C) Provide consultation for young friends. If young friends have questions or difficulties, we will analyze and answer them to the best of our ability. 4) The scope of work for young friends is roughly as follows: (A) Everyone should self-consciously summarize what they have learned in school during the semester, what are their insights, what do they not understand, and what do they disagree with, and express them as much as possible. (B) Everyone should truthfully describe their experiences with the education and management of their school this semester and give fair criticisms based on their own observations: what should be promoted and what should be reformed. (C) What do young friends plan to do, how do they plan to do it, and why do they plan to do it during the summer vacation?

<h3 id="e158">Analysis of Life Insurance Policies by Fei Mengfu <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Life insurance takes legal effect through a contract (called a policy) between a life insurance company and the insured (generally known as the policyholder). The amount to be paid by the company is the face value of the policy, and the amount to be paid by the policyholder is the premium. It is necessary to have a large group of people seeking life insurance protection, so that the law of averages can be accurately applied, and the life insurance company can accurately know the amount of premiums to be paid by each policyholder. Therefore, to describe the operation of individual policies, it is necessary to assume that there is a large group of policyholders.</p>
<p>The Risks Borne by the Company</p>
<p>Suppose there are one thousand people aged thirty who simultaneously take out life insurance, with no savings feature specified on the policy, but hoping that one thousand yuan will be paid to their estate (beneficiary) after their death. The risk borne by the insurance company is one thousand times one thousand yuan, or one million yuan. If the company wants to collect the correct amount of premium, it needs to know when each person in this group will die. According to the life insurance mortality table, it is well known that not all of these one thousand people will die in the first year. However, it is certain and indisputable that the mortality rate in this group will increase year by year.</p>
<p>In the first year, eight of these thousand people will die. With such a simple calculation, it can be known that if the company charges each person eight yuan, it can guarantee one thousand yuan of life insurance for this thousand people for one year.</p>
<p>The Cost of Protection</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second year, this group will be short eight people, and the number of deaths will be higher, so the annual insurance cost will also be higher. The cost of protection increases every year until the age of the survivors reaches sixty or seventy, at which time the insurance for each person will inevitably be extremely high. Therefore, insurance companies should devise a strategy to allow each member of the group to equally distribute the cost of insurance over their lifetime. This can be achieved by charging a level premium. In this way, the amount collected in the early years will be higher than actually needed, so a reserve fund can be accumulated to prepare for future increases in mortality. Under a whole life policy, the policyholder continues to pay premiums for life, and if an accident occurs at any time, the insurance company immediately pays the face value of the policy to the policyholder's beneficiary.</p>
<p>Whole Life Policies</p>
<p>Let us discuss how this type of policy can protect policyholders against current dangers: First, this type of policy protects the policyholder's family. Therefore, when family protection is the main motive for insurance, this type of policy is always preferred. After the first premium has been paid, a large sum of cash property is immediately established. This amount is larger than what can be saved through other means over many years.</p>
<p>Cash Value</p>
<p>Second, the cash value of this type of policy increases year by year, until the policyholder reaches the normal retirement age (sixty or sixty-five), at which time they will have a substantial and absolutely certain fund in their life insurance policy. When the policyholder reaches old age, the need for family protection may be greatly reduced. Therefore, they can cancel most of their insurance and take back the cash value for their own use.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned one thousand people do not wish to continue paying premiums for their insurance, but would rather pay higher premiums for a limited number of years, the company can issue limited-payment policies instead of whole life policies. In this case, premiums are only paid for the first ten, fifteen, or twenty years. Because the annual premium payable for this policy is higher than that payable for a whole life policy, its savings feature is obviously greater. The policyholder can accumulate a higher cash value in old age. This cash value can be withdrawn by the policyholder for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Savings Element</p>
<p>This group of policyholders may still feel unsatisfied. In addition to insurance protection, they want to include a larger savings element in the contract. They want to stop paying premiums at age fifty, sixty, or seventy and be able to receive a large sum of savings. The company can issue endowment policies to meet this need. Premiums are paid for ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, or thirty years.</p>
<p>If the policyholder dies within the specified period, the company will pay the face value of the policy to their beneficiary. If the policyholder is still alive at the end of the period, the insurance money can be paid to the policyholder themselves.</p>

<p>Life Insurance is Savings</p>
<p>Using Money Wisely for the Future</p>
<p>The Best System for Protection</p>
<p>By Yang Ling</p>
<p>Republic of China, Date</p>
<p>Mr. Fei Mengfu, an American from Massachusetts, is a well-respected leader in the insurance industry in Shanghai. Immediately after graduating from Wesleyan University, he worked in the U.S. Army Medical Department, accompanying the expeditionary force to the French battlefield. After more than a year, when the European war ended, Mr. Fei went to the University of Edinburgh in England to continue his studies, focusing on philosophy. He was then hired by National Tsinghua University as a professor of philosophy and English. After three and a half years, he often enjoyed studying modern and ancient Chinese philosophy in his spare time. Deeply convinced that life insurance was essential for China, he changed his career to the insurance industry. In early 1922, he worked at American International Assurance Company. Facing numerous and complex tasks, he knew how to identify and appoint talent, and his planning was detailed and precise. In just a few years, the company's total insurance in force increased from nine million yuan to fifty-one million yuan, and Mr. Fei was promoted from a humble secretary to branch manager, assistant manager, and finally general manager.</p>
<p>Children's Education Insurance</p>
<p>The above points are the outlines of the three main types of life insurance contracts: whole life, limited payment, and endowment. These three types of contracts include the policies issued by various companies. Special contracts that meet specific needs are merely variations of these three main types of contracts. For example, a children's education insurance policy issued by a certain company is a type of endowment policy with a specific purpose. It creates a fund for future children's education expenses and dowries. Another type of</p>
<p>so-called three-benefit policy, a special contract, provides permanent protection for the policyholder's entire life, and also includes a savings feature, combining the principles of a limited-payment whole life policy and an endowment policy.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Four Essays on Life Insurance by Yu Ci <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>This article is written by Yu Ci, the current special advisor and honorary director of China United Life Insurance Company. Three articles have been published before this one. This is the fourth article, which discusses in detail how life insurance can promote social and economic welfare and the necessity of Chinese life insurance companies having expert guidance.</p>
<p>Life insurance is a profession that requires specialized talent, just like engineering, law, medicine, and other professions. Those engaged in the life insurance business who want to develop their business must have expert guidance, as discussed in the previous article. This article, in response to readers' requests, will explain the basic principles of life insurance as a profession and the qualifications required for life insurance actuaries. This is because the study of life insurance contains very deep mathematics, and it is quite difficult for those without mathematical training to understand the principles.</p>
<p>The origin of life insurance was mentioned in a previous article, where friends invited each other to pool money to provide for the surviving family members of the deceased. From this simple meaning, it gradually expanded to become the most important social organization today. Its benefits to society and people's livelihood cannot be measured by numbers. As a certain authority said, "In this time of global economic recession, society relies on this layer of protection, otherwise the consequences would be unimaginable."</p>
<p>As the life insurance industry gradually evolved from the nature of mutual assistance between individuals, the problems that needed scientific research to solve gradually arose due to the enlightenment of experience. The age problem is one of them. Except for those who die due to illness or accident, the higher the age, the closer they are to the end of their lives. Therefore, the amount of payment should be fairly distributed according to the age. Since the organization of life insurance companies, this payment, or what is now commonly called insurance premium, is determined and collected by the company according to the age of the policyholder, and the company fulfills the obligation to provide for the surviving family members of the deceased.</p>
<p>When this system was first implemented, life insurance companies only relied on the mortality statistics investigated by the government or public organizations as the standard for setting insurance premiums. However, this statistics is a general population census. In order to fairly calculate the insurance premium, people with poor health should not be allowed to take out life insurance, otherwise most of the insured will be weak people, and the mortality rate will inevitably increase. Since the insurance premium is determined according to this standard, it will inevitably be too high and beyond the individual's financial capacity.</p>
<p>After the above shortcomings were discovered, the applicant had to go through a selection procedure before confirming the initial method of organizing a selection committee dedicated to this matter, and then progressed to having doctors examine the physical condition; Today, the medical departments of various life insurance companies have become a very important part of the company because of their relationship with the prosperity of the business.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the medical department, life insurance companies have gradually been able to create their own mortality statistics to replace the previously cited official statistics. The method is to collect materials supplied by most life insurance companies from their practical experience, analyze and sort them out, and make them. The first statistical table named "Life Insurance Calculation Method" or "Experience Integration" was published in 1843 AD, and the materials were supplied by seventeen British life insurance companies. The statistical table currently used in the United Kingdom is compiled by the London Life Insurance Calculation Society, and its materials are more detailed. The one currently used in the United States is still the "American Economic Life Insurance Statistical Table" published in 1868. In addition, there are also monographs on statistical tables specially compiled for tropical and subtropical countries.</p>
<p>After the above-mentioned statistical table, life insurance actuaries can use scientific methods to accurately calculate insurance costs without the drawbacks of leaning too much or too little. In addition to using the amount of insurance as a proportion, the amount of insurance premium must also be based on the age of the policyholder to see what the mortality rate is at this age. Without this statistics, there would be no accurate standard to follow. Although this does not mean that the insurance premium should increase every year because the policyholder is one year older and closer to death, if this is the case, the insurance premium will be higher and higher, which will inevitably be beyond the economic capacity of the insured. Life insurance companies that previously set insurance premiums according to this principle have all encountered failure. Later, the so-called "equal insurance premium level" system was adopted, that is, the insurance premium is determined first, and the same amount is used as the standard during the insurance period without increasing it. The basis of this system is to use the method of drawing from the surplus of the insurance premium in the first half of the insurance period to make up for the deficiency in the second half of the insurance period. The life insurance company collects this money and deposits it separately, extracting compound interest as a preparation for fulfilling its obligations in the future. This money is called the "deposit", which is the reserve that the life insurance company should have at any time. The nature of this reserve is so complex that the calculation of its amount should be sufficient to meet the needs, and it cannot be handled by non-professional actuaries.</p>
<p>Among all undertakings, none is more stable and more easily effective than the life insurance industry. To prove this with facts, the European War</p>
<p>and the post-war epidemic were rampant, and countless people died, but it has never been heard that life insurance companies have gone bankrupt as a result. Furthermore, in terms of the current situation, the world economy is in decline, and all industries are in depression, but the life insurance industry alone has made great progress. Tracing the cause, the life insurance industry is based on scientific principles, meets the needs of the times, and those engaged in this industry are mostly people with rich talents and knowledge, so the principles can be fully applied. Furthermore, due to the completeness of the life insurance laws in various countries, the interests of the public who invest in the life insurance industry are protected, so the life insurance industry can thrive.</p>
<p>The enactment of Chinese life insurance laws is only a matter of recent years, but this is also enough to prove that the life insurance industry is gradually being valued by society. Since the current law is newly created, it is difficult to compare it with other countries; however, it is not easy to improve it without the help of experts and borrowing from foreign countries. Therefore, this point may still be difficult to realize, and Chinese life insurance actuaries, because the life insurance laws of their own country are incomplete and cannot protect the public interest, need to have a deeper understanding of foreign life insurance laws. This point will be discussed further in the next issue of this special issue.</p>
<h3 id="e161">The Greatness of the American Insurance Industry by Da <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>We can imagine the astonishing greatness and importance of the insurance industry in the United States from the report of the New York State Department of Insurance. The assets accumulated by insurance companies of all levels approved to be established in New York State are no less than 32,491.36 million yuan, accounting for 10% of the total wealth of the United States. In 1930, their assets were more than this number, having reached as high as 32,900 million yuan. The reserves paid to the government by various companies over the years amounted to 9,000 million yuan by 1932. The assets of New York insurance companies are more than twice the U.S. national debt of 19,500 million yuan. The capital stock of each company</p>
<p>is now worth an average of more than 260 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The insured people of various types of insurance in the United States enjoy 10% of the total national wealth. Their financial resources, in addition to paying off the entire national debt, can also pay each person residing in the United States 100 yuan. If they want to withdraw these funds in cash immediately, it would require three and a half times the cash in circulation and in the treasury of the United States to be sufficient.</p>
<p>In 1932, life insurance companies throughout New York State had large amounts of premium income every day, because at that time most people needed insurance to secure their property and their lives, so the premiums paid to the companies by the insured people every day amounted to about 15 million yuan. At this time, the cash collected by various companies accounted for about 80% of the circulating currency. The application and need for this huge power can also be seen from the payments made to the insured people. In the same year, the total expenditure of the company due to death, fire, accidents, diseases, earthquakes, windstorms, economic panic, dividends, etc., was no less than 357.819 million yuan, which is nearly three-fifths of the circulating currency, averaging more than 11 million yuan per day (excluding Sundays). Even if the insurance companies only have the current assets, and there is no income from premiums and interest from various investments and mortgages in the future, they will be able to sustain the same losses as in 1932 for nine years without failing. Insurance managers have various fluent words and appropriate reasons, so that men, women, businesses, goods, etc. all have the need for insurance. Without the effect of this kind of effort, the company itself would not have accumulated and created this great power.</p>
<p>From the above statistics, we can recognize the power of the insurance industry in the United States and the greatness and importance of its mission.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Defending the Clothing Front <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yansong</p>
<p>I am willing to lead the charge with a crossbow,</p>
<p>And I hope that my compatriots will provide support from the rear.</p>
<p>Reading the customs import statistics, I am saddened! The first item of imported goods is cotton cloth, and the eighth item is wool; these are all necessities for clothing for our compatriots. Like a tide and a mountain, no commodity can match them, while our country's silk, which is known for its beauty, is gradually declining, abandoning goods on the ground, and seeking help from others. Is this not the same as abandoning domestic chickens and preferring wild ducks? The country is weak and the people are poor, and it is appropriate that this should happen!</p>
<p>If commerce is called war, then today's merchants cannot be compared to those who only sought a profit of one in ten in the past. Since our country opened to trade, there has been commerce, but there has been no war. There has been war between merchants themselves, but there has been no war with foreign merchants. Foreign merchants take us as a market. Their national goods come in like entering an uninhabited land, while our merchants are guiding them every day, or slightly sharing their fodder as a stopover. Isn't this sad and shameful? In recent years, the stimulation has deepened, and concepts have changed. Patriotic psychology has gradually deepened, and merchants have also become well aware of the importance of promoting domestic goods, and domestic silk has shown vitality.</p>
<p>However, like a war, soldiers charge into battle as their duty, and the supply of military rations and the support of the masses are also necessary for victory. Today, when domestic silk battles with imported silk, silk merchants are soldiers on the front line, and the financial industry is the one who controls their rations, and the entire people are their only support from the rear. Only when the financial industry cooperates with the silk industry can the source of rations not be in short supply, and only when the entire people have something to wear, must they wear domestic products, and then the support from the rear will be solid. Yansong is unworthy, on the one hand, he is a soldier charging into battle, and on the other hand, he is also engaged in the military supply of providing rations. He dares not decline the charge with a crossbow. What I earnestly hope from my compatriots is that my compatriots will each fulfill the responsibility of supporting from the rear, so as to defend this clothing front. This is all I have to say.</p>
<h3 id="e163">American-Asian Jacquard Crepe Dressmaking Method <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Jiao</p>
<p>It is already July, and summer clothes are almost all prepared, so naturally we have to think about autumn clothes.</p>
<p>Men naturally rarely have the time to think about this, but young ladies or fashionable young wives are naturally eager to plan ahead. They are planning how to get beautiful clothing materials, and in a very economical way.</p>
<p>The most beautiful clothing material is silk, and silk is the most suitable for autumn clothing, but ordinary silk is either not fresh in style or very expensive. Imported silk is of course more expensive, and of course, famous ladies who are patriotic and understand reason will not use it, and naturally choose domestic silk.</p>
<p>The jacquard crepe of the American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory is the latest product completely woven with real silk. The texture is very soft and thin, and the luster is also very brilliant, but it does not have the fiery artificial silk fabric that is too bright, and in fact it is stronger than Indian silk; there is also a special feature, that is, it will not wrinkle ││ the first requirement for women's clothes worn on the body is that they should not have wrinkles. Too many wrinkles are not elegant. Jacquard crepe is printed with various novel patterns. Smart women can choose and buy patterns that suit their preferences. Whether they are fat or thin, or of any age, there is a great connection between the patterns and colors of the clothes. (For example, red clothes are not beautiful on fat people, and clothes with long stripes on thin people appear even thinner and longer, which is also not beautiful.) Jacquard crepe has many colors and patterns. Smart silk shop staff will definitely offer jacquard crepe that suits everyone's needs. This kind of jacquard crepe is now on display in large quantities at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Domestic Silk Exhibition, and the China National Goods Company on Nanjing Road and the Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, and Lai Wah department stores and major silk shops are selling it, and the price is very low.</p>
<p>An ordinary cheongsam probably requires eight or eight and a half feet</p>
<p>of silk material to make, but nine feet of jacquard crepe can make two pieces, isn't this very economical? Because the width of the jacquard crepe is two feet eight inches, which is not available in any silk piece. Now there is a cutting method, which is published in the figure on the left;</p>
<p>Cutting Method</p>
<p>Cheongsam length of three feet seven inches Cut nine feet of material into 12 taels Fold back by three feet seven inches for the back Find small pieces for cutting All have extra Nine feet of material can make two cheongsams</p>
<p>Find sleeves Find collars Find sleeves Small flaps</p>

<p>— Cheng Shouchong</p>
<p>From the customs statistics book, we can see that the export of silk is decreasing year by year, and the price of silk in the world market is also depreciating day by day. Domestic silk factories have no choice but to close down and stop work, creating a new record of terror. Because the international silk market has long been seized by violent Japan, and the farmers in the silk-producing areas have to continue to raise silkworms and cultivate mulberry trees with the concept of hoping for next year because of their livelihood. However, there is no Chinese financial organization abroad, and there is no direct foreign trade hub in China. The products are still sticking to the old ways, which leads to the inability to attract foreign customers, and the products are blocked in the domestic market. The only way out for weaving silk is only for a small number of Chinese people to enjoy. In addition, years of war and cheap grain hurt farmers, and brilliant foreign goods are rampant in our country with their dumping policies, and the sales of domestic silk have no place to stand. Silk cocoons are a major source of profit in domestic products. Once silk is stockpiled in the market, it will have a major impact on people's livelihood. If we don't plan for it early, silk will collapse and never recover. Now the silk industry has held a national silk exhibition to arouse the people to wear silk materials made in their own country. The mission it bears is not just for observation. It must be known that the psychological construction of adopting domestic products is in this one move; the great cause of reviving national silk is also in this one move! We should conduct large-scale tests on visitors to lay the foundation for revitalizing and improving national silk in the future. The method can be to print ready-made questions, or make a chart to be filled in by visitors, and let visitors understand that the national silk exhibition is not just for watching the excitement, but has a major mission to assist the silk industry, improve weaving, and consolidate the foundation, so that the source of profit of domestic silk is still in the hands of the Chinese people. Here are a few points:</p>
<p>(1) Testing</p>
<p>(1) The most suitable silk material;</p>
<p>(2) The most agreeable color;</p>
<p>(3) Which is more beautiful, printing or weaving?</p>
<p>(4) Do you like beauty or durability?</p>
<p>(5) Are the prices too low or too high?</p>
<p>(6) The gender, age, and occupation of the visitors.</p>
<p>(7) Which factory's products do you like the most?</p>
<p>(8) Which kind of goods has the fairest price?</p>
<p>By collecting and analyzing the above points, you can understand the psychology of customers. Therefore, the meaning of the exhibition is only to arouse customers' desire to buy and to distinguish national silk for exhibition. It is considered a non-fundamental exhibition. In order to develop the silk industry and promote the sales of products, we should base on the results of the tests to determine the business policy and weaving policy, take advantage of this opportunity of the national silk exhibition, and seek factual basis, and do not make guessing estimates with the action of a blind man riding a blind horse. Stop weaving products that do not meet the customer's psychology as soon as possible to avoid the danger of reducing consumption and stacking up.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Bowing the Head and Accepting Marriage, Fragrant Feelings Tenderly Caring, Delighting the Soldiers</p>
<p>Gui Zhi smiled at Man Ying and said, "So, in the future, Battalion Commander Tian will surely be promoted to Brigade Commander." Man Ying smiled faintly, without replying. That evening, it was late, and Ye Zhong stopped there, not continuing. The next day, Man Ying took the mother and daughter to see a talking movie. That evening, there was nothing to do, and they chatted idly in the house, and Mrs. Huang joined them. Madam Jiang said that she had left home for two or three days, and she was still a little worried. She would not go shopping in the market tomorrow and would return to Haidian early. Mrs. Huang held a water pipe in her hand, leaning towards them as she sat. She smoked two pipes of water, took out a handkerchief from her pocket, wiped the pipe mouth, then loaded a pipe of tobacco, held it with both hands, and handed it to Madam Jiang, smiling, "Have a pipe of water." Madam Jiang took the water pipe and said with a smile, "You people living in the city still smoke this?" Mrs. Huang said with a smile, "I'm used to smoking this, it's all the same, and it's much cheaper than smoking cigarettes." "Do they smoke water pipes in Haidian?" Madam Jiang said while smoking, "It's simply impossible to find one. Now the people outside the city are also learning to be fancy, what's not the same as in the city!" Mrs. Huang said, "You don't come to the city easily, do you?" Madam Jiang said, "Isn't that right? Miss Huang went to Haidian and said that the city is more prosperous than before, so our girl was happy for a while and insisted on coming! They dragged me along too, so I had to come and bother you for two days, and I should go back tomorrow." Mrs. Huang said, "Aren't you entrusting the old master of the Zhao family to watch over the house for you?" Madam Jiang said, "Yes. But after all, one can't always entrust others to take care of one's own family affairs." Mrs. Huang said, "Isn't Old Master Zhao a very nice person?" Madam Jiang said, "He's a very nice person. Battalion Commander Zhao is also a very nice person. Not to mention entrusting him to watch the door, even if it's something more important, it wouldn't matter to ask Old Master Zhao for help, but we're always embarrassed." Mrs. Huang said, "I heard our child say that Old Master Zhao still wants to arrange a marriage with your family, but it probably didn't work out, right?" (124)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e166">Beside the Eyebrow Pond <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>He woke up from his dream, turned on the electric light, and looked at the round gold clock on the small table. It was already half past three. He rubbed his eyes and warmed up his dream again...</p>
<p>He was sitting alone in his study, admiring her photo that she had personally given him. Just as he was missing her, she suddenly arrived gracefully. He was so happy that he jumped up and hurried over, holding her jade-like white hands, saying:</p>
<p>"Yue! You actually came, you actually came at this time, I was just missing you! I thought that being able to come at this time would be the most comforting thing for me, but unexpectedly, you actually came!"</p>
<p>"Ying! I was reading Mo Ruo's new poems alone, and I was so attracted by his poems that I felt very uneasy alone. At the same time, in my imagination, it seemed like someone was waiting for me. Who do you think this person waiting for me is?"</p>
<p>His face was red and he said...</p>
<p>"How would I know that! I think the person waiting for you must be the one you love the most!"</p>
<p>"That's right, that's exactly who I love the most! It's you, it's you..."</p>
<p>They could no longer restrain themselves, and their lips met.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a kitten, as if admiring their love, jumped in from the window silently. This jump was nothing, but it startled the harmonious couple. They thought someone was teasing them, so they separated and looked. It turned out to be just a kitten! They couldn't help but smile, but the kitten squatted at her feet, motionless.</p>
<p>They chewed on candy and chatted idly, from the vastness of the sky to the trivialities of the family. Finally, they discussed clothing. He said...</p>
<p>"Yue! You really agree with me. Since I graduated from senior primary school, I have abandoned all foreign goods for daily use and have not used them since. Although the import of foreign goods has increased unabated, I personally have not bought any of them. You are the same as me, which shows that our hearts are the same, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"My Ying! I think that we Chinese people, at a time when foreign insults are becoming more and more urgent, still don't know that everyone should use domestic goods. When it comes to that critical moment, I think there is absolutely no other way except to go to a dead end. Look at the so-called modern girls nowadays, who are afraid of not being modern every day. From head to toe, they deliberately research and create the elements that make them modern, and of course, they are all foreign goods. Don't you think this is a huge leak? If one person is like this, and millions of people are like this, it has caused a great panic in the Chinese silk industry. The biggest reason for this is the modern girls. In order to save China, we must first transform the hearts of modern girls, so that each of them has the determination to use domestic goods, then there will be a glimmer of hope!"</p>
<p>"The new cheongsam I'm making now is much better than foreign goods, and it will probably be finished tomorrow. Let's meet in Jingyuan and I'll show it to you."</p>
<p>Just at this moment, he suddenly woke up, and he tasted it as if he were eating olives.</p>
<p>After he woke up, the fresh flowers on the table seemed to have become more beautiful. He became even more excited and didn't want to sleep anymore. He opened the drawer, took out her photo, and stared at it in a daze.</p>
<p>Later, he saw her wearing a new dress in Jingyuan, made of light</p>
<p>green georgette, paired with slightly purple buttons, which further enhanced her charm. He suddenly remembered the scene in his dream last night.</p>
<p>Holding hands, they walked to the edge of the Eyebrow Pond and sat down side by side. He told her about the "dream."</p>
<p>"Ying! Your dream is so strange. This dress of mine is indeed newly made. The fabric was bought from the China National Goods Company. They have so many domestic silk fabrics! I wonder why people still want to use foreign silk!"</p>
<p>"Yue! Chinese silk has so many modern patterns, I always want to think of a wonderful way to advise them..."</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, her eyes were fixed on the pond, where a pair of mandarin ducks were quietly resting with their wings together. They also imitated them in the same way.</p>

<p>(Nichi-Ren, Kyoto, 8th) Since the outbreak of the Kyoto University student unrest, students from the Departments of Law, Economics, and Literature have united to confront the Ministry of Education authorities, issuing leaflets and small magazines to publish the truth about the incident. Recently, students from the Department of Economics decided to take it a step further, sending lengthy articles and statements to newspapers and magazines in major cities around the world, reporting the truth about the Kyoto University incident and arguing that this is not just a Kyoto University problem, but a struggle between Japanese fascism and liberalism. Students from the Department of Law have also prepared statements in English, German, and French, sending them to major news agencies in various countries. The impact of this and the internationalization of the Kyoto University student unrest are quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Ministry of Education Approves Jiangsu Education Department to Implement Primary School Regulations with Flexibility <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Jiangsu Education Department, stated that there were four points of difficulty in implementing the Primary School Law and Primary School Regulations: "㈠ Article 16 of the Primary School Law stipulates that primary schools shall not charge tuition fees, but may collect a reasonable amount based on local conditions in public primary schools, with a maximum of one yuan per semester for elementary grades and a maximum of two yuan for higher grades. Articles 65 and 66 of Chapter 11 of the Primary School Regulations also have very strict regulations regarding the collection of tuition fees in primary schools. Article 68 of the same chapter also stipulates that primary schools shall not charge children</p>
<p>miscellaneous fees. The Ministry is actively promoting compulsory education, considering the hardships of the people, but it has been found that most primary schools in various counties in Jiangsu Province collect tuition fees as a principle, and the tuition fees are included in the budget as legitimate income. The amount of collection is carefully determined based on the local living standards and the situation of the people. Generally, the smaller amount is similar to the standard stipulated in the Primary School Law, and the larger amount, such as in Wujin, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other counties, is four to six yuan per semester for higher grades and two to four yuan per semester for elementary grades.</p>
<p>This is several times higher than the standard stipulated in the Primary School Law. In the above-mentioned counties, the tuition income in the budget is around 100,000 yuan. If it is suddenly changed to collect according to the Primary School Law, the legitimate income will be greatly reduced. Before there is a way to compensate for this, it will be necessary to suspend some grades, which is contrary to the purpose of popularization. Furthermore, although primary schools in various provinces and counties do not formally include miscellaneous accommodation fees in the budget, they often rely on this fee to subsidize office expenses and repair school buildings. In total, it is about 150,000 yuan per year in the province. If it is abolished all at once, the government will have to find a way to subsidize it, otherwise it will be difficult to maintain the progress of the business, and the indirect impact will not be small. Considering the above two points, at a time when disasters are frequent and financial resources are exhausted, and it is impossible to actively prepare for compensation, it is proposed to temporarily maintain the current situation in the province and gradually reduce the amount of collection in the future, so as to comply with the regulations. ㈡ The Primary School Regulations stipulate that the number of students in each class should be 40, with a minimum of 25. This seems to be a slightly wider restriction compared to the provincial regulations of 50 students per class, with a minimum of 30. The province's economy and strength are extremely restricted. Regarding the number of students, please allow us to temporarily follow the provincial standard. ㈢ Article 11 of the Primary School Law stipulates that the principals of county, city, district, meritorious, or township primary schools shall be selected and recommended by the county and city education administrative organs and submitted to the county and city governments for appointment, and shall be submitted to the education department for record. Furthermore, the principals of affiliated primary schools shall be hired by the principals of the managing schools and submitted to the managing education administrative organs for record. The above two regulations are slightly different from the current methods in the province. Principals of county primary schools in the province have always been selected by the county education bureaus in accordance with the regulations and submitted to the county for reporting to the education department for approval, and then appointed by the county government. Although this is not without twists and turns, it was originally intended to be cautious in the selection of personnel, and in principle, it does not violate the Primary School Law, and it seems that it can still be implemented. After a part of the provincial middle schools in the province implemented the independent normal school system and were changed into normal schools, the original experimental primary schools of each middle school were also changed into affiliated primary schools of the normal schools. The persons in charge were changed from principals to directors, but qualified personnel were still selected by the principals of the normal schools and submitted to the education department for approval, in order to preserve the spirit of independence, which is implicitly in line with the purpose of the Primary School Regulations. It is proposed that on the one hand, the title should be immediately changed to principal, and on the other hand, qualified personnel should still be selected and recommended by the principals of the normal schools and submitted to the department for appointment, so that they can be兼任. ㈣ The Primary School Regulations stipulate that the county and city education administrative organs may designate one primary school in each school district as the central primary school, but shall not indicate the word "central" in the school name. It has been years since Jiading, Jinshan, and other counties in Jiangsu Province implemented the central primary school district system, especially the facilities in Jiading, which have achieved considerable results. The method is to abolish the education committees and select a complete primary school with excellent performance and a central location in each district to be designated as the central primary school. In addition to fully providing the research results for the reference and implementation of the primary schools in the district and actively supervising them, the principal also has the administrative power of the education committee. The only difference from the Primary School Regulations is that it avoids the name of "central." It is believed that the current central primary school district system in Jiangsu Province has already achieved results, and its purpose is only a matter of name. If the central school loses its ties due to the trivial matter of changing its name, and the hard-earned harvest in the past is completely lost, it seems regrettable. It is proposed to allow it to continue to be implemented on an experimental basis, in order to see its success." Please examine the actual situation and allow temporary flexibility, etc., and then order the department to say, "After checking, the points presented are factual. For the first point, due to the difficulty in raising funds for a while, it is approved to continue to handle it as before, but funds should be raised in the next two years to compensate and reduce the amount of collection, so as to comply with laws and regulations. For the second point, the minimum number of students stipulated in the Primary School Regulations shall not be changed. The original intention of the regulations is not violated by the number of students exceeding 40, and it should be approved. The original intention of the regulations is also not violated by the third point. The fourth point is of a testing nature and should be allowed to be flexible."</p>

<p>Crawford won the second set very easily, but the loss in the fourth set was similar. In the final set, both sides fought to the death, and the servers won the game again.</p>
<p>Until 5-5, Crawford broke Barnes's almost irresistible violent serve again, winning a crucial game with a sliding four. Finally, Crawford's serve was successful, and Crawford won again and won the championship. The cheers shook the clouds for three minutes.</p>

<p>September 5th in Ningxia</p>
<p>Please send graduates from the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School to assist and guide</p>
<p>In order to promote sports and achieve the goal of strengthening the country and the people, the seven provinces of Northwest China, including Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, and Mongolia, have specifically decided to hold the Northwest Seven Provinces Games in Ningxia on September 5th, in order to arouse the interest and efforts of the general public in the seven provinces of Northwest China in sports. However, these provinces are located on the border and lack specialized sports guidance talents, especially in women's sports. On the 3rd of this month, Jiang Zhujia, who is in charge of the sports meeting in the province, sent a special letter to Shanghai, inviting female instructors from the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, which has a long-standing reputation for sports, to assist and guide, and to serve as referees for the meeting. After the meeting, they will serve as sports instructors in various schools in the area, as a starting point for promoting women's sports. It is heard that Ms. Lu Lihua, the principal of Liangjiang Women's School, in view of the fact that the matter is related to the promotion of sports in the border areas, plans to send several graduates with excellent results within the next few days to serve there, regardless of the hardships.</p>

<p>The result was 19-1, the Shanghai team's pitcher was weak</p>
<p>The two teams will play again today, and the Shanghai team has a new lineup</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Waseda Baseball Team defeated the Shanghai Athletes Team 19-1. The Shanghai team's lineup was scattered due to disagreements between Mai Ling and the amateur team, and the pitcher was weak. There were three pitchers, but none of them improved. In the seventh inning, after changing to Peifers, he was "walked" and the opponent scored five points in a row, which was a rare weakness. The audience was in an uproar. Another reason was that the first pitcher of the amateur team, Lin Peng, did not play yesterday in preparation for today's game. The two teams will play again at the Chinese Baseball Field at 3:00 p.m. today. The Shanghai team has decided to use Lin Peng as the pitcher, paired with the best lineup, and with the guidance of the experienced Yigen, it should not be difficult to wash away the shame of yesterday's defeat. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Waseda 〇〇四三二八〇二〇 19 points</p>

<h3 id="e197">Suspicion Breeds Dark Demons <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Zhouren</p>
<p>In the past, being limited by teachers to write essays was very painful because there was nothing to say. Now that I can write essays freely and without any subject, it is still very painful; there are many people with mental illnesses who read articles, and suspicion breeds dark demons, and they see thorns that ridicule them from the gaps between the words. When Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" was published as an appendix in the Jingbao, "many people were trembling with fear, fearing that they would be scolded in the future. And a friend said to me (Hanlu) in person that a certain paragraph in yesterday's "The True Story of Ah Q" seemed to be scolding himself. Therefore, he guessed that "The True Story of Ah Q" was written by someone, why? Because only someone knew about his private affairs. … When he found out the author's name, he realized that he did not know the author at all, and therefore, he suddenly realized himself, and then declared to everyone that he was not being scolded." (Hanlu Idle Talk) Fortunately, the author and the person with mental illness did not know each other, otherwise Mr. Lu Xun would have been wronged. We are born into this world, and it is inevitable to close our noses and sneeze; but it is also mostly written casually, without any deep meaning, and those with mental illnesses must say that it is ridiculing him, so the person who writes feels the pain of writing and the difficulty of finding a topic at all times! When "The True Story of Ah Q" was included in "A Call to Arms", someone asked Mr. Lu Xun: "Who exactly are you scolding?" Mr. Lu Xun could only say with grief and indignation: "I regret that I cannot make people see that I am not so inferior!"</p>
<p>Yesterday I read the "Two Kinds of Autumn Rain Cottage Notes", in which a passage quoted many poems from predecessors. For example, the poem chanting the waterfall says·· "Flowing to the former stream without a word, making many sounds in the mountain." For example, the poem chanting the iron horse says: "What is the matter with the tinkling sound? It is the people under the fence who are not happy." For example, the poem chanting the summer cloud says: "Infinite drought seedlings are dying, leisurely making strange peaks." For example, the poem chanting the cicada says: "Don't rely on high branches to sing loudly, you should also look back at the praying mantis." These poems are good because they were written by the ancients. If they were written by Mr. Lu Xun, I don't know how many people would be blushing and thinking that they were talking about his privacy. The wise and holy emperor is on top, and "the breeze does not know the words, why is it flipping through books indiscriminately" has the misfortune of being beheaded. The literary inquisition was originally decorating the prosperous age of peace!</p>
<p>If you want people to have no mental illness, even Freud has no way to do it. Although it is a bit painful, let's improve the writer's side. In the past, there were two secrets to being a doorman under the famous dukes, giants, and wealthy households. The first one is to always say "You look very good, and you've been getting better lately!" If he asks us to estimate his age, estimate a forty-year-old to be thirty years old, and a fifty-year-old to be forty years old. Although it is a smile, his joy is known. The second type is that if he buys antiques or collects calligraphy and paintings, estimate fifty dollars to be one hundred dollars, and estimate one hundred dollars to be one hundred and fifty dollars. Don't estimate too much, which shows that you are an amateur, and never estimate too little, which shows that he is an amateur. And you must have something to say, seven parts praise and three parts criticism, which is exactly what he likes. This is what Mr. Feng Zhiyu called "the art of three ugliness". If we want to avoid people's "suspicion breeding dark demons", we can only improve it in this way.</p>
<p>However, the love song "The Reeds and White Dew" has a preface saying that it "刺襄公也，未能用周禮，將無以固其國焉" (sarcastic of Duke Xiang, because he failed to use the Zhou ritual, he will not be able to secure his country). When there are too many interpretations by virtuous people, even the places that the saint does not take seriously will jump out with a satirical meaning; we only pray that the virtuous people who make interpretations will be merciful... because the man who wants to love does not care about these "Zhou rituals"!</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Method of Preserving Life <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Recently, writers are prone to disappear, and once they disappear, they become a "happy ending". In such a world, it is really necessary to pay attention to the method of preserving life.</p>
<p>I accidentally flipped through a thread-bound book and got Chen Meigong's method, which I immediately made public to the world, saying: "The superior man closes his heart, the middle man closes his mouth, and the inferior man closes his door."</p>
<p>The plan of closing the door is clumsy and obvious, because staying at home easily arouses suspicion, or is thought to be holding secret meetings, or is thought to be making bombs. Moreover, as the saying goes: "Sitting at home with the door closed, disaster comes from the sky", which has long revealed the unreliability of closing the door.</p>
<p>Confucius entered the temple of Houji and sealed the mouth of the golden man with three seals. As the saying goes, "是非只爲多開口" (trouble only comes from talking too much), so it is important to close your mouth. Ruan Sizong "does not criticize people", and once got drunk for two months, refusing Sima's marriage proposal, and deeply understands the way to close his mouth, so he was able to avoid the same mistakes as Ji Kang, and can be used as a model, but there are still some improprieties.</p>
<p>Those are his eighty-two poems of nostalgia. Although these poems are said to be "difficult to measure with emotion after a hundred generations", Chen Hang made a note, saying that many of them use "妾婦" (concubine) to mock Sima, and "膏火" (grease) to compare villains. Fortunately, Chen Hang was not at the same time as Sizong, otherwise, if these words were spread to Sima and his subordinates, could Ruan Ji still "善終" (die well)?</p>
<p>People who want to write poems of nostalgia do so because their hearts are too sensitive. Even if the "言至玄遠" (words are mysterious and distant), they must beware of "索隠" (searching for hidden meanings) families. Therefore, the superior man is able to close his heart.</p>
<p>Mr. He Ru has given an example of closing the heart, that is, Ren Yong of the Later Han Dynasty, who saw his wife committing adultery in front of him, hid the truth and said nothing, and saw his son fall into a well, but endured and did not save him.</p>
<p>But can you do it?</p>
<h3 id="e199">Another Fire Thief <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Meng</p>
<p>The source of fire, the Greeks thought, was stolen from the sky by Prometheus, so he angered the great god Zeus, who chained him to a high mountain and ordered an eagle to peck at his flesh every day.</p>
<p>The Wawanganti people of Africa also use fire, but it was not taught to them by the Greeks. They have another fire thief.</p>
<p>People cannot know the name of this fire thief, or it has long been forgotten. He stole fire from the sky and passed it on to the ancestors of the Wawanganti people. Therefore, he angered the great god Daras. This passage is similar to the ancient Greek legend. But Daras's method was different. He did not lock him on the mountain peak, but secretly locked him in a dark cellar, without letting anyone know. What was sent was not an eagle, but mosquitoes, fleas, and bed bugs, sucking his blood while making his skin swell. At this time, there were also flies, who were the best at finding wounds, buzzing and sucking desperately, and then pulling a lot of fly dung on his skin to prove what an unclean thing he was.</p>
<p>However, the Wawanganti people did not know this story. They only knew that fire was invented by the chief's ancestors and used by the chief to burn heretics and burn down houses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, transportation is now developed, and some African flies have also flown to China. I heard this little bit from their buzzing.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Sorrow of the Middle Class <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>When the poor reach the point where they have no pants to wear, the rich bosses are naturally worried, but fortunately there is still a middle class in society. Although it has become pitifully dry, it still has some oil and water compared to those who have no pants to wear. The greedy eyes of the rich bosses are shining on them.</p>
<p>They want to cry, but they still want to get rich, and they still want women. The rich bosses may understand this better than they do themselves. He extends the most tempting and stimulating giant spirit, not afraid that these middle classes will not fall into the net;</p>
<p>"You can turn stones into gold with just a little effort!"</p>
<p>"This is the time to explore the naked palace!"</p>
<p>Young masters naturally don't care about this 18,000, the poor still can't afford this pack of cigarettes that costs more than a dozen copper coins, the idle long gown class and the small businessmen with tears in their eyes are waiting day and night for such a windfall, their economic ability is only enough to blow the ashes of this kind of cigarette, and from then on they will work harder to blow, "It hasn't been a month… it's already been given away", so here come another 500,000 numbers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we are told, "Up and down are full, please come early tomorrow!" Naturally, the patrons here are still those friends who are neither up nor down.</p>
<p>However, even if the picture is more naked, it is still empty. There is no way but to "seek a good partner" and "seek a son-in-law", I am afraid that no matter "I only seek a gentle nature, regardless of poverty" and "Regardless of whether you are married or unmarried", the results will always be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>As expected, it only takes a little effort, but the miracle of turning stones into gold cannot fall on everyone's head. The stomach cannot always be empty, and you still have to drag a broken gown. Fortunately, the newspaper has recently been willing to give people "self-employment introductions" without advertising fees, so there are dozens of them appearing every day. Those with literary talent can also write a "special self-employment introduction". However, the cold reality will simply not listen to your thorough complaint, it doesn't need anything from you except to turn the "stone" into the rich boss's gold vault!</p>
<p>Most of the commercial advertisements in the newspaper every day are almost all expressions of the rich bosses' clever exploitation of the middle class, and at the same time there are equal pages printed with the weak moans of those who are being exploited!</p>
<p>The sorrow of the middle class will continue to extend until its demise!</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Most Recent Discovery <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhisheng</p>
<p>Two months ago, I happened to hear friends talking about something called "Liberation Lyrics" and the big name of a certain Mr. Zeng, and I thought it was just an ignorant and reckless person trying to show off. As a result, he was met with rebukes from all sides, perhaps he already deeply regrets trying to be clever and failing? At that time, I thought people like Mr. Zeng were just laughable.</p>
<p>Later, I unintentionally ran into a certain gentleman familiar with the inside story of the Shanghai literary and art circles, and after listening to his words, I finally realized that the rebukes from all sides regarding "Liberation Lyrics" not only did not prompt Mr. Zeng to reflect, but instead made him elated; because when people scolded "Liberation Lyrics," they would bring up Mr. Zeng's name, and Mr. Zeng could use this to become famous. There are originally people in the world who are accustomed to putting on a clown's face, making grand pronouncements and jokes everywhere, and as a result, they become famous. Mr. Zeng is just one of the youngest among them. So I felt that this person was really boring and shameless.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I suddenly saw Mr. Cui Wanqiu's advertisement in the Shen Bao and the records in the fifth issue of Sino-Foreign Books and Newspapers, exposing Mr. Zeng's private affairs, saying how he borrowed the names of friends to brag about himself, and how he spread rumors to slander his friends. Oh! Such a thing happened! So I felt that Mr. Zeng was not only boring and shameless, but simply sinister and terrible!</p>
<p>I remember when people criticized "Liberation Lyrics" before, a friend said; the "Liberation Lyrics" like "playing mahjong" are just like a pug wagging its tail, trying to get a smile from the ladies after dinner and drinks. Neither the person nor his words deserve to be criticized. Now I know that the pug's mouth actually has poisonous teeth, and it will bite people unexpectedly, even secretly biting the hand that feeds it bread. Inherently flawed types are originally not limited to just one or two, and there are probably still many hidden in the literary and art circles. If you are not careful, you will be sold out. No wonder my friend, Mr. So-and-so, warned his son not to think about becoming a writer. These are truly experienced words. Mr. So-and-so's passive approach is actually not feasible. People in the literary and art circles should work hard to do a cleanup to maintain the purity of the literary world. At least, they should post a few more slogans;</p>
<p>"Beware of pugs with poisonous teeth!"</p>

<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>"Fifth Brother Shi," Bo Tang said, "You are too worried. Do you think they will detain people?"</p>
<p>"Whether they detain him or not is secondary," Pei Yu said, "It's always good to be cautious."</p>
<p>"Then, Bo Tang, why don't you make a phone call and ask him to come here first thing tomorrow morning?"</p>
<p>"Great," Pei Yu urged Bo Tang, "Go make the call!"</p>
<p>Bo Tang was a little annoyed and said, "No need."</p>
<p>"What if something really goes wrong?" Pei Yu said, "If you don't go, then I will!"</p>
<p>"His phone is borrowed from next door. It's so late now, everyone is already asleep, who would be willing to call Zhi Guang to listen to the phone for you?..."</p>
<p>"Then call first thing tomorrow morning!" Pei Yu said.</p>
<p>"Isn't that the same as no one being willing to do it... If you really want him to come, just have A Ming take the car to pick him up early tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>This accidentally gathered meeting of relatives and friends passed such a proposal.</p>
<p>Around seven o'clock, A Ming drove the car to Cai Shi Road to pick up Zhi Guang, but Zhi Guang had already gone to the factory in Da Nanmen. A Ming rushed to the factory and found out that Zhi Guang had already left with several workers, and no one knew where they had gone; the situation in the factory was not tense, because there was no work to do, so there were not many workers.</p>
<p>Bo Tang's residence was on the south side of the road, standing at the wrought iron gate, looking south along the cement path inside the gate... on the left, a row of locust trees connected to the branches of the neighbor's trees outside the wall, and on the right, a French-style two-story gray-white western-style building; however, what you see first is the rear section of that western-style building. Twenty steps further ahead, there is a semi-circular stone staircase made of five or six stone steps, closely connected to the entrance of the L-shaped corridor downstairs, walking around the corner of the corridor and then south is the front porch of the building, and in front of the porch there is also a stone staircase, long, square, and high, facing the lawn more than an acre wide in front of the building. Although the color of the grass only shows a withered yellow shadow, such an area, matched with the long doors and long windows of the two south-facing halls downstairs, is also very rich in harmonious meaning. These two halls are of course where Bo Tang has always entertained guests; but now, not only have the two halls been converted into the main part of his temporary shelter for those relatives, friends, and refugees, with all the furnishings moved away; but even in the passage behind the hall, which forms the main artery of transportation in the rear of this western-style building, many floor mats have to be opened at night, so when A Ming jumped out of the car and walked up the semi-circular stone steps to open the doors on both ends of the passage facing the stairs, he still saw the heads of many maids and older sisters, half-hidden and half-visible in several comforter covers on the ground.</p>
<p>He tiptoed slowly from the gaps in the stalls of people lying like salted fish to the side of the handrail on the north side of the passage, just about to step up one or two steps, when he heard his female owner asking from the handrail upstairs...</p>
<p>"Is that A Ming? Has Mr. Zhang been picked up?"</p>
<p>A Ming reported the facts again. Pei Yu asked...</p>
<p>"Does no one in the factory really know? Have you asked carefully?"</p>
<p>"Asked," A Ming said, "No one knows, I think they took a rickshaw towards the public building, so it will naturally be slower."</p>

<h3 id="e203">Financial: Little Increase in Silver Prices, Gold Pricing Process Extremely Monotonous <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Midway Covering Shorts Once Saw a Momentary Advance</p>
<p>Ultimately Headwinds of Selling Caused Prices to Fall Again</p>
<p>After the previous day's sharp decline in the gold market, yesterday was quite calm. Midway, covering shorts was eager and prices rose at one point, but ultimately, due to the bank's squeeze and headwinds of selling, prices still fell. The situation is uncertain. In the early morning, due to the drop in the electrical London silver price and the rise in the American silver price, the forward silver price on the Gold Exchange only rose by two and a half and one and three-tenths of a penny, which was not satisfactory. In addition, American cotton fell by nineteen pounds and American wheat also shrank by more than one cent. Stocks rose slightly, and people's minds seemed stable, but because the British and American exchange rates rose sharply by two dimes and two cents, and the American and British exchange rates rose by one dime, one cent, and one-eighth of a cent, they failed to open high. If the increase in British and American and American and British exchange rates were reversed, then prices would continue to fall. The gross plate initially made thirty-two yuan, then retreated to twenty-five yuan. After opening, with large households like Bing Xing aggressively covering shorts, it rose sharply at one point, and the HSBC listed American exchange rate increased by another half yuan due to squeezing exchange rates. The road to rising was greatly hit. Soon, the exchange market loosened and the situation went downstream. The process during the morning was mediocre, and the result was a slight increase. Under the combined calculation of the strength of the American silver price increase and the American and British exchange rate, it was felt that it shrank a lot. When the American silver price was the same price before, the gold pricing was outside of eight hundred and eighty yuan, so the gold market's sentiment turned better and the future was still uncertain. The cooked red price was increased by one hundred and sixty-six yuan. The situation of the morning market is recorded as follows:</p>

The bank ate September US dollars at four thirty-seven-five, and stuffed three seventy-five. Heng Xing, Qing Fa, Yong Bing Xing were on the buying side, while Yuan Chun materials sold. At this time, it was extremely calm, hovering between two and three yuan. When HSBC announced the listing, there was also a lack of change.

<p>丨Afternoon Market Due to Time Constraints, Only One Round of Pricing Was Done丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange's market became even better. There has yet to be a concrete solution for the Sino-British loan. The situation of the investigation and peace is hopeless, and it is inevitable to resort to military force. The market's momentum is not affected. There are many people who have come from afar to cover their shorts, and the situation on the table is more tense than before. In the morning's opening, the Disarmament Bond rose another yuan, and the others also rose by two or three dimes to five or six dimes. There were many who covered their shorts, and there were also many who temporarily went short, so the amount of the rise was uneven. The second round of momentum, initially, seemed stable, slightly better by three or four dimes. When pricing was done to the Consolidated Tax, suddenly due to the enthusiastic bidding, it jumped wildly by more than one yuan and continued to rise step by step, soaring, and the situation was very beautiful. The Salt Tax also rose with the momentum, the highest price reaching fifty-four yuan and two dimes. The journalist predicted that fifty-five yuan was within reach. The Consolidated Tax was highest at fifty-two yuan and seven dimes, the Disarmament Bond was highest at sixty-seven yuan and nine dimes, the Reorganization Bond has already broken out of forty yuan, and the others have also broken out of fifty yuan. The rise was fierce and rapid, which was also unexpected. The reason is that this time, the bulls are strong and powerful, and have remained unmoved throughout. The shorts were slightly panicked, and the panic intensified. Retail investors added fuel to the flames, resulting in a crazy and endless rise. Secondly, because the chips were exhausted, the bulls were easy to manipulate, and special news about the environment was enough to add to their power. In the afternoon, due to time constraints, only one round was done, and market prices rose and fell, showing a slight calm, and the trend was still very strong. The future may see a reversal, so be careful. The 96 has seen a return wind, but because there is no interest relationship, it alone fell six or seven dimes to one yuan.</p>
<p>The others continued to rise by a few dimes to about two yuan, with the whole number 6 being the most superior. The total number of transactions was two thousand two hundred and forty-three ten thousand yuan, of which five thousand yuan were spot goods, and the future Consolidated Salt Tax accounted for six hundred and forty-four ten thousand, the Disarmament Bond accounted for two hundred and fifty-one ten thousand and five thousand, the 19 Customs Bond accounted for two hundred and seven ten thousand and five thousand, the 20 Customs Bond accounted for three hundred and eighty-seven ten thousand, the 96 Bond accounted for three hundred and ninety-six ten thousand, and the others ranged from several ten thousand to five or six hundred thousand.</p>

Among them, American Wireless Telegraph was the most active, with one transaction reaching fifteen ten thousand shares. The price was ten yuan and a half. Copper rose to foreign nine cents per pound. Today the bulls came out of their cage, and the momentum was like a tidal wave, and the market was still able to absorb it. However, people's hearts have gradually become uneasy, so a technical rebound is possible. American cotton fell because the estimate of tomorrow's cotton fields is about to be released, and the bulls sold off. Wheat was still firm at the beginning, but declined due to profit-taking. The harvest situation is still poor, but people's hearts are not panic. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market is still tired, and the falling wind is especially strong. Because the foreign cotton news is favorable to the shorts, the yarn market is originally weak, and the sellers have this help, so their power is even greater.</p>
<p>The general floating bulls are showing signs of collapse again. Some say that the factory</p>
<p>The meeting convened by the factory yesterday failed to adopt a unified intention to suspend work, so speculators are again selling short, and the market is even more tired.</p>
<p>(Yarn Falls One Yuan Eight Jiao Nine Cents)</p>
<p>The market was flat at the opening of the Ren Biao Pre-Market, and the foreign cotton was falling. The yarn factories' suspension of work failed to be uniform, and the selling wind rose again.

<p>The cotton market is gradually showing signs of tiredness. There is fear that the foreign cotton's acreage report to be released tomorrow may be favorable to the short, so people's hearts are more and more panicked, and the selling wind is great. However, the buyers of old cotton are tightening and not letting go, so the market is still hard. However, there are more people selling from far months.</p>
<p>(More Households Selling Far-Term Flowers)</p>

<p>New York, 7th Dispatch: A report on the cotton market for the week states that at the beginning of the week, President Roosevelt's decision to raise domestic prices caused the dollar to plummet, and the continued drought in the Southwest led to active buying and new price peaks. However, this also triggered a reaction, and the destruction of cotton fields is proceeding rapidly. The northwest of Texas has also received heavy rain. The government's first count of sown acreage as of July 1 will be the basis for the destruction. The result will depend on the impact of the reduction movement. The cotton market is firm, but trading is limited. Both supply and demand sides are uncertain about values, and seem to be waiting for the development of cotton spinning regulations, handling fees, and cotton production reduction. At the same time, the authorities' monetary and economic policies are also limiting the market.</p>

Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Sisi rice, as well as both Northern and Southern varieties, were all being actively traded. However, the Northern varieties preferred high-quality rice, while the Southern varieties favored Zhongguan rice, totaling 1,600-1,700 bags. As a result, prices continued to rise slightly. Yinbianyuan rice remained in tight supply.</p>

Kejian rice prices were stable, and Baiyuan rice showed a slightly tight trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market generally showed a fluctuating and stable trend after the opening bell. The quoted price for foreign wheat was around 4 jiao in Chicago and 1-2 jiao for good Canadian wheat. After the opening, both industry insiders and outsiders believed that the Northern merchants were interested in spot flour, so confidence turned stable, slightly better than the previous day by about one cent. Then, due to profit-taking by bulls, the market weakened slightly again. By the afternoon opening, confidence in both near and distant futures had improved. It was agreed that the Northern merchants would restore their pre-war territory and actively seek spot flour. It was rumored that the troopships would not depart immediately, but only Tianjin merchants would open 30,000 bags of Huafeng Meigen, priced at 2.22 yuan. And Dong merchants also bought long-term contracts, so confidence was driven up, and the situation, although not crazy, seems to be temporarily stable. As a result, this month was better by 2.25 cents, August was better by 2 cents, September was better by 1.75 cents, October was better by 1.25 cents, November was better by 1.5 cents, and December was better by 1.25 cents.</p>

Although the quoted price for foreign wheat showed that U.S. wheat fell by 4 jiao and Canadian wheat fell by 2 jiao, due to excellent weather in recent days, the arrivals, though heavy, were mostly of high quality. Lower grades of wheat were scarce, so the desire to sell was slightly lessened. In the afternoon, also because of the flour market, the market continued to show strength. However, in general, the future cannot be too optimistic. As a result, this month rose by 5 cents, August rose by 6 cents, September rose by 5 cents, and October rose by 3 cents. The spot market still saw strong arrivals, with an estimated 20,000 carloads and boatloads of wheat still arriving. However, most of the arrivals are held by merchants who, due to their high quality, are unwilling to sell, and the mills are only responding to meet immediate needs. This situation of mutual exclusion may not be resolved in the near future. The opening prices for Wuxi wheat were 3.5 yuan, second grade 4.4 jiao, and third grade 3.7 jiao. Zhenjiang wheat was 3.55 yuan, second grade 4 jiao. Luhe wheat was 3.53 yuan, second grade 4.5 jiao. Suzhou wheat was 3.55 yuan, second grade 5 jiao. Hezhou wheat was 3.45 yuan. Taipingqiao wheat was 3.63 yuan. Puzhen wheat was 3.4 yuan. Jiangbei wheat was 3.63 yuan. 7,200 bags were opened and sold by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Rise by Several Dimes <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Since Thursday of this week, both customs gold and Dutch currency have been steadily rising, and sugar prices have also been rising across the board. However, with the increase in Dutch exchange rates and the cost of Grade 25 raw Java sugar above 21 yuan, dealers are reluctant to let go. The association's listed price for Grade 24 raw white sugar was 20.25 yuan. The initial call price was 20.3 yuan, with some transactions at 2.8 jiao, up slightly from the previous day. Grade 8-9 Dutch red KD mark was 16 yuan, Changxing Xing RA fine sugar was 21.1 yuan, Guanghua Factory Lu character was 20.3 yuan, Shou character was 19.9 jiao, and Quan character was 19.5 yuan. The price of powdered sugar plus Guangbao was 20.07 yuan. Various grades were available, but the factory was still tightening the disk and limiting the exchange amount. The market heard that it would rise later. Taikoo sugar B mark was 21.4 yuan. There were Teochew merchants opening dozens of semi-Southern Qing bags at 12.7 jiao. The Bang Wufu white ice was opened sporadically, and the price per stone remained at 17.2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Silk and Tea: Zhejiang's New Summer Cocoons are of Excellent Quality <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>(Zhejiang's Summer Dry Cocoons are Shipped to Shanghai Daily)</p>
<p>The new summer cocoons from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other places have been on the market for many days, and the fresh cocoons collected by the cocoon shops are now being dried and shipped out. In recent days, 500-600 bags of summer dry cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai daily from stations such as Genshanmen and Changan.</p>
<p>(Shuanglin Summer Cocoon Opening Price Rises Steadily)</p>
<p>The summer cocoons from Shuanglin in Huzhou are abundant and of high quality, and cocoon prices are rising steadily. The highest price has risen to 44.5 yuan, and the lowest is 30 yuan.</p>
<p>(Hangzhou and Shaoxing Summer Cocoons Have Little Reeling Loss)</p>
<p>After the Hangzhou and Shaoxing close summer cocoons are shipped to Shanghai, the results of the trials in various factories show that the improved varieties of high-quality cocoons only have a reeling loss of 52-53%, 100 catties of dry cocoons produce 100 catties of silk, and 280-290 catties of fresh cocoons are dried into 100 catties of dry cocoons.</p>
<p>(Exchange Rate Increases, Silk Sales Improve)</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York silk prices continued to rise by 4 cents, and the price per pound opened at 2.29 yuan (U.S. dollars). Yokohama raw silk fell back by 10 yen. Due to the exchange rate increase, the price of silk in Shanghai has increased and Chinese merchants are holding firm. The market is quiet, and sales of white, yellow, and gray silks from factories have been completely absent. Transactions are pending.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Local Specialty Zhenmei Tea Sales are Active in France <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Recently, teas from Tunxi, Suian, and Wuyuan have been selling very well. Among them, Zhenmei, Zhenmei needle, and pearl tea varieties have been selling as soon as they arrive, for almost a month, and the market has remained firm, which is unexpected by tea merchants. Local specialty green tea has been sluggish since the new goods entered the market. Therefore, only one or two of the forty or so tea factories are operating, and even those are intermittent. Yesterday, British companies Xiehe and Yihua began to actively purchase local Zhenmei tea due to demand from French companies. The green tea market appears to be stable. Although the ending stock of black tea from Qimen and Fuliang is only 17,000-18,000 boxes, the sales to the British merchants are gradually dwindling, and the Russian merchants think the prices are too low. The situation is still difficult to consider optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e221">The True Happiness of Life <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>In the "Slum Life Special Issue" of this journal, Issue No. 26, the reporter mentioned our motive and hope in publishing that special issue. This time, the publication of this "Home Life Special Issue" requires even more explanation. We respectfully seek the guidance of our readers.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the vast majority of readers of this journal, in this national group where illiteracy accounts for more than 80%, are still in the position of the literate class. Our environment can also be said to be living a life that is far from being enough (comfortable home) and more than enough (slum). We may be worthy of the title of "middle class"? Or some people question the permanence of this so-called "middle class". We believe that the length of this class is not what we want to argue, but in the current situation, under the lifeless state of the entire nation, especially in the semi-colonial environment of Shanghai, we feel that those who deeply feel the pain of oppression and who are the most energetic, courageous, and determined to strive for the equality of human life are still this so-called "middle class." Because they are also oppressed, and at the same time, they understand the reasons for this oppression better than their compatriots in the slums. We believe that for the future revitalization of the Chinese nation and the transformation of the entire social system, this so-called "middle class" is the sharpest and most sensitive tool. Although we know the strengths of this class, we should also know the general biggest shortcomings of this class, that is, it is very easy to change its mind halfway, be fickle, and lack the spirit of hard work. The reason for this shortcoming is mostly due to the relationship of the past environment. Isolation of the lives of the majority of the laboring masses, lack of empathy, lack of sense of responsibility, unclear path of transformation, on the other hand, it is dazzled by the comfort of home life, tempted by individual hedonism, does not understand the principle of human evolution and the creation of mutual assistance, and does not have the correct meaning of life. Regarding the former aspect, the reporter has briefly discussed it in the "Slum Life Special Issue" of Issues 26 and 27. What we want to discuss today is the latter aspect.</p>
<p>We silently observe a kind of "foolish and content" expression of most of the hard-working masses in the country, as well as the most leisurely enjoyment of the various material pleasures created and invented by foreigners from the results of mutual assistance and effort, and we will sometimes feel the fear that this ancient nation will decline and perish. Although our voice is very weak, we will never give up. We want to cry out loudly to arouse the awareness of compatriots with aspirations to save the country and a few who enjoy a comfortable home life. If this personal-centered attitude towards life does not change, then all other tunes for saving the country and the people will not be able to be played!</p>
<p>The first thing to be brought up for discussion is whether people who enjoy a comfortable home life can get the true happiness of life? Even if we take a step back from an individual point of view, we know that so-called happiness is just a comparative term. For example, "peace" comes from a comparison of movement. If there is no movement at all, then there is no feeling of "peace". As for "happiness", it comes from a comparison of suffering. If you don't encounter the problem of "suffering" or pursue "suffering", then even if there is so-called "happiness", it is very superficial and monotonous. The "peace and happiness" that the enjoyers of this kind of life can get is definitely not as interesting as the bystanders imagine and guess. In fact, according to what we know, there are many enjoyers of comfortable home life who feel that life is boring and painful because of excessive "peace and happiness". Moreover, people are not only animals that can use their hands, but also animals that can use their brains to think and seek progress in the environment. We probably all know that thinking and studying problems with our brains is not a happy thing. We easily envy the happiness of an inventor who invented something, but we often do not pay attention to the various hardships he has gone through before the invention. Therefore, a person's true happiness is to seek "peace" in movement, to gain "happiness" in suffering, and to seek happiness from the "progress" of overcoming difficulties and pain. We believe that this is the true happiness of life. We ask, can the true meaning of this happiness be understood by ordinary enjoyers of comfortable home life?</p>

<p>— Little Dull</p>
<p>Daily Life of a Rich Family</p>
<p>丨This material is based on the description of a nanny, but slightly整理丨</p>
<p>The ladies have finished playing cards, and the young master and young lady have returned from dancing! "Knock knock!" The door was knocking like thunder, and I, who was so tired that I couldn't open my eyes, had to squint and grope my way out to open the door.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Why so slow?" The young master scolded as he opened the door.</p>
<p>Leather shoes and high-heeled leather shoes walked upstairs, clattering.</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>Six o'clock; seven o'clock... Twelve o'clock, the sun is hanging in the middle. The lady has slept enough. "Nanny, the opium tray." After lighting the lamp, preparing the pipe, and placing it properly, I carried it upstairs. "Chi chi..." The lady smoked opium. The master woke up. "Nanny, face water." After pouring the face water, I took it upstairs and placed it.</p>
