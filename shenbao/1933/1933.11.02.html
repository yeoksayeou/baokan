<h3>日本之國策協定運動</h3>
<p>— 偉</p>
<p>在所謂「第二非常時期」一富於激刺性之呼聲下宕近。日本曾舉行所謂「國策恊定運動。」</p>
<p>「國策恊定運動」之舉行。又顯然爲由於運部少壯派之策動軍部少壯派之意。蓋欲藉此運動。對内恊調各政黨。拉攏各財閥。以實行所謂「舉國致。」對外則亦欲藉此運動。以確立其「國防第一主義。」俾得貫澈實行其主張。故此一運動。其實質仍爲少壯派軍人勞力伸張及日本益趨向於獨裁政治之表徵。</p>
<p>誠然自國際形勢觀察。日本處境。實亦日即於艱難。日美之間。怒目相同。日蘇之間。箭拔弩張。對英旣以退出國聯而發生惡感。復以競賣傾銷而發生正面之衝突。瑕日而立者幾皆爲日本之敵人則謂此時爲日本之「非常時期。」誠亦不謬。不過此種情勢。實爲日本軍閥之　武政策所一手造成。不急謀釜底抽薪。而猶欲藉國策恊定以貫澈其主張。則揚湯止沸。所謂國策。究將如何以打破此非常之時期也。</p>
<p>當齋籐與各政黨開始會商國策之際政友會曾單獨向政府提出整頓海陸軍備。確立對國聯中美英蘇之外交方針。完成對「滿」之經濟聯繫。改良敎育制度。穩定財政基礎。增加輸出减低輸入等五項意見。此種主張可謂已曲意遷就軍部之意志。代表民政黨之若　。則着目於赤字財政。其在代議士會上之演說曰。「財政上出現了赤字。是亡國之兆。塡補赤字。是當前最大的急務。」彼又謂意大利在過去苦於軍備擴張軍費浩繁之時曾有某報刊一諷刺畫書爲一骷髏曳一大砲其情形頗與當前之日本相恍惚。若槻之意。蓋亦頗不滿於日本少壯派軍人專横之行爲。而深以財政政枯竭爲可憂。故借是畫以示諷刺。耳然而彼少壯派之軍。人則一意孤。行不稍瞻顧必欲要求財政經濟軍事外交之統一。荒木陸相對記者談話。曾謂將以砲火救日本。且曰「如政府當局不覺悟。我自有决心。又何必空談卸責。各閣員若能了解此内外危局。國策自能决定。」彼荒木之意見。隱謂即使日本變爲骷髏。亦必曳大砲而前進。故其後在五相會議中。仍堅持其主張。毅然進行而一無顧恤也。</p>
<p>在五相會議中。日本之所謂「國策。」亦旣已有大綱上之確定。舉凡軍事外交財政。幾無不一本軍部之主張而决定。高橋藏相雖曾基於財政之見地。表示反對擴張軍備。但最後亦終歸於屈服而止。日本少壯派之軍人。從茲更可趾高氣揚爲所欲爲矣英保守黨每日電聞報上曾刊一文。謂不出數月。日本内閣。將全由陸海軍人組織成之。其言或不爲神經過敏之推斷歟。</p>
<p>雖然。日本之財政。今確已呈現一百孔千瘡之象而農村之破落且更足使此種赤字財政陷於永恒繼續之狀態明年度陸海軍部。又有龐大之新要求。彼如此竭澤而漁。無非爲擴張軍備。而其擴張軍備。無非爲美蘇英三國之假想敵。假使此三國之假想敵。有一實現成爲火線上正面之敵人者。則日本此時果將實行其焦土政策。以骷髏曳大砲而戰歟。抑自信能操必勝之劵歟。今在此一往直前如瘋如狂之狀態中。亦有人獨清獨醒。深思熟慮此一危險關頭乎。</p>

<h3>李維諾夫　悄然離法赴美　搭乘何船秘而不宣　小住巴黎曾與彭古談商約　對美談判前途不願表意見</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　蘇聯駐法大使能宣稱、蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫業於今晨啓程前往美國、與羅斯福總統商談復交問題、惟因李氏不願外間知其行踪、故所搭乘者究係法船「香伯蘭」或德船「白萊門」或美船「柏倫伽利亞」、則蘇聯大使館拒絶宣怖、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日懼空中轟擊　海軍省否認廢除潛艇</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　昨日每日電聞報載稱、東京政府對於潛水艇一艘廢除原則、業已承認云云、英國官塲及日本負責方面均以不知作答、茲每日電聞報又發出社論、謂據「日本負責人士」聲稱、日本政府頃已贊成有條件廢除潛水艇之原則、「日本海軍部及若干有勢力之人士、或者主張保全潛水艇、但就全體國民而言、則對於空中之轟擊、特别畏懼、日本政府因受輿論之督責、對於避免此種轟擊之建議、準備予以贊助、蓋以敵國飛機必以航空母艦載運、始能飛到日本、乃以廢除航空母艦、爲犧牲潛水艇之半官式交換條件、」該報結論謂、「英國政府始終主張無條件廢除潛水艇、最小限度亦當减少潛水艇噸數、俾其力量僅足保衛各國海港」云云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>太平洋代管島　日本提出常年報告　將來代管權口岸築砲壘　國聯會討論時未曾涉及　各會員質問土著減少原因</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院今日集議、最令人注意者、爲日本向國聯提出其代管太平洋若干島嶼之常年報告書事、討論此報告書時、　　言及將來代管欋、亦未言及口岸築砲台事、與會者向日代表伊　詢間島中之財政地位、成立預算案之方法經濟制度、出入口貿易·敎育·公共衛生·勞工狀况·及信仰自由等問題、尤注意於島中土著户口之減少伊藤答稱、土著人民減少太平洋各島皆然、自一八五零年以還、調查此事者不下二十八起、但從事調查之專家、對於減少之原因、及應行之補救方策、迄未有一致意見云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　羅斯福總統已照會英政府、告以美國抬高國内物價、安定國外美元之計畫、具有友好精神且此純因國内情形而起之内政云、總統現待英國之答覆、庶美國在歐洲市塲中之動作、不致引起報復之計畫、與互抑幣値之競爭、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　英美不久將成立貨幣休戰之說、現已愈覺可信、據可靠消息、美總統已將英美合作之切實計劃提交英國戰債談判總代表李斯羅士、其内容主張兩國通力合作消除金元英鎊間匯價之波動、美政府刻正待英政府答覆、然後訓令聯邦儲備局實行國外購金計劃、但聞美國現欲金元之步跌、俾國内物價可以漸漲、兩英國則對於避免外匯之猛烈波動較爲關切云、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　關於羅斯福總統黄金政策之此後步驟、現爲人所切盼、據消息靈通者言、總統此次操縱黄金提高物價之最後謀略、如歸失敗、則將採行一種直接的通貨膨脹之方法、而達於國會所許總統可將美元金成分減輕一半之限度、或將採行一種複幣制、亦未可知、聞當局現欲先悉英國對於總統購金計劃之意見、而後着手在國外收買、不甚可恃的金礦股票現紛紛出現、此乃金程序公佈後結果之一、自羅總統就職後政黨休戰至今、但今日黨爭復起、共和黨全國委員會已發出一文、謂羅總統在選舉時依允穩健的通貨·國際貨幣會議·平衡的預算·及中央政費裁减等項、悉被破壞云、國家復興案實業顧問會中有重要實業家五人、現已辭去委員之職、據其表面理由、謂係遵照輪流服務之辦法云（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　當此全國著名經濟家預料美總統在貨幣方面、再將有一大舉動之際、共和黨全國委員會已開始攻擊羅斯福總統言行之不符及徒知爲本黨派分官職、據著名經濟家預料美總統决定在國内外收購黄金後、已發生混亂局勢、必須再有一大措施以證清之、並信收買黄金計劃、爲膨脹鈔票以前之最後手段、倘收買黄金仍不能提高物價、則農業份子將要求實在膨脹大發鈔票、雖然據渠意見、苟非減輕金元價値、繼令大印鈔票亦未必能使物價有顯著之提高、且即使減輕金元價値、物價之提高亦屬暫時的現象、人民不久即將對於通貨失其信任云云、現各方對於收買黄金計劃多　　不言、致全國人民神經過敏、而證券市面亦因此大受謠言影響目下政府方面對於購金計劃、僅金融善後公司總理瓊斯發表聲明、否認美國企　操縱全世界金産、並否認公司業在國外市塲購金且亦並未决定開始購金日期、不過其期當不在遠此外萬和黨全國委員會則已發行小册子宣稱、美總統之放棄金本位主張統制貨幣、業已違反民主黨黨綱、而歷次在貨幣上措施、亦與就職前本人所給人民之保證相反、迨接受國會所予膨脹貨幣權力、遂不復維持本黨黨綱及自已發表之政策、又謂美總統在公共工程計劃内徒知爲本黨人員派分官職、失業工人之實際獲得工作者不過五萬人、此外又攻擊美總統在宣布反對增募外債後、復允許中俄之棉花借欵云、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦銀行家仍不明瞭羅斯幅總統之黄金政策、且自認不能發現固定金價之根據、以爲决定金價出於專横、如羅總統政策稍搖動、世人對於金幣之信用、則所得結果將適與羅總統所期望者相反、以其鼓勵佛郎之轉爲美元、而提高美元價値也、據路透社紐約來電、華盛頓訪電皆謂美當局希望英國在美國担任謙遜的而有約束的動作時、採行中立政策云、其意殆謂美國僅稍稍在國外收買黄金、以期左右美元、但不欲礙及世界金市也、據華盛頓負責方面消息、此事雖不久必向倫敦提出、但目前尙未切實發動、（三十一日專電）</p>
<h3>佛郎地位穩固</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　財政部及法蘭西銀行方面、有人明白宣稱、美總統羅斯福雖在歐洲市塲購買大批現金、然無論如何、佛郎穩固之地位、决不受其影響、又謂美總統購買大批現金究有何意、迄未說明、故吾人於其目的所在不得而知、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>礦區生氣盎然</h3>
<p>舊金山　據礦治交易所報告、美總統收買黄金計劃不問將　　果若何、西方各州金鑛區現已大見興盛、在數月前冷落若死之礦區、今復生氣勃然、重呈肩磨轂擊之觀、有一金鑛業中心、自最初提議准許新採黄金出國以來、户口即迅速增加、迄今已增一倍以上、目下各公司莫不獲利甚豐、即不甚著聞之小公司、其股票亦發生猛烈之投機狂、加里福尼亞與尼伐達兩州鑛區報告、照目前新採黄金價格、即前此産金不旺將遭虧折之鑛區、今亦可以開採而獲利矣、最近政府决定照國外市價更高之價、收購新採黄金後、更予採金業一新剌激云（三十一國民社電）</p>

<h3>喬裝守候</h3>
<p>顧旣得悉唐之住址後、乃一人先赴該處加以察勘、但見該屋内設有成衣舖、而屋之左右、麕集乞兒甚多、顧思維再四、乃向成衣舖店主說明案情、一面率領偵緝員貢富金·周培三·徐有亮·胡葵生·沈錦初等分别喬裝乞丐或人力車夫、在該屋四週守候、復派一人爲成衣匠長駐偵察、但枯守多日、並無一人往來、詎至上月十四日下午四時半、突來一人、將釘置門旁之户口登記證取去、怱怱向西而去、</p>
<h3>男女就逮</h3>
<p>顧見斯人來去倉皇、料其必赴警所户籍處報告遷移、急派人尾隨而往、果係報告遷移、其人返時、行至弄口、忽然不見、幸顧等已在該屋中拘獲一男子及一少婦、男子名唐世豪、即唐世雄之弟、而少婦則爲其妹、唐世豪年二十七歲、在十六舖會館塲開設新公記報關、少婦適翁仲良爲妻、兩人帶隊、加以盤詰、據唐世豪供、在行中治事、阿兄差姪前來命至兄處、兄見面時即謂我將離滬、上海已非我得居留、問其何事、據云若未曾見報章上所載之七萬元盜竊一案乎、犯者有我、吾去矣、家事可代料理之、姪可在行中學業、吾此去則回歸合肥豐樂河故鄕、遂將鈔洋三千元送胞妹處貯藏、皮箱一只、内鈔四千元、由嫂携去二千元赴瀏河母家、五千元則由妹夫翁仲良轉存銀行、日者盛德興來、謂現在被拘之邵榮培、欲將其脫罪、須用一千元、以便凑成交付、此次前來退租房屋、以致落網云云、</p>

<p>惟唐世豪則由顧連城率偕貢福金周培三徐有亮等、備文同往合服、拘捕唐世雄、沿蕪湖巢縣等地、雇舟而往、豐榮河係一鄕鎭、去城約八十里、全係旱道、縣政府當派偵緝隊長徐守粹率二探員前往、在該鎭住宿一宵、偵查唐世雄固在、家於一家茶館之西廂房、後在燕子窩、方始逮捕、唐之行動、非常豪爽、並無有反抗舉動、此間有鎭長爲唐之族人名唐世堯、在段合肥當國時、一度任督軍、現在訓練團丁保衛鄕梓、顧等往時、唐世堯以世雄犯案忒大、亦無阻撓、一路間土匪頗夥、得未發生意外、誠大幸事、該犯已於昨日抵滬、經盧隊長盤訊、據唐之供如下、</p>
<h3>燒香盟誓</h3>
<p>此案之起意、則爲邵榮培、以及張阿炳·陳榮福·徐小毛等、謂輪船中往來帶有鉅數鈔洋、曾在浙江旅館、開會商議、由徐小毛找覓銅匠、添配鑰匙、並由祝阿章購爛鐵藥水、加以試騐、結果不靈、後用錐子鑿毁、始告成功、而我之被邀入者、則爲盛德興、曾到城隍廟燒香盟誓、攝取照片、行竊時、我喬裝乘官艙之闊客人、祝阿章當僕人、乘機與茶房魏玉明成相識、往返計有十餘次、最後盜得、用火油箱盛鈔票、至安仁街德興家剖分、盛初與我一萬元、後又添增四千元、前業水菓、失業以後、幸由弟周濟、此次案件、實受盛德興之愚云云、</p>

<h3>國貨年之檢討　丨可憐國貨滿街唱，贏得東洋貨更狂丨</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>今年是國貨年，國貨年的成績在那裏？除了上海和各地舉行展覽會和設立國貨公司以外，這十個月中，我想來想去，想不出什麽好的成績來。獨是銀行之多，好像雨後的春笋，聽說没有開幕而已向官廳登記的，尙有三十家之多，嚴君諤聲說：「今年與其說國貨年，不如說銀行年」。</p>
<p>這話很有道理。可是開了許多銀行，是否來扶植工商，贊助國貨事業？是否於産方銷方，予以種種的便利？是否實心實力，放欵各工廠，使他們有維持發展的機會？事實的顯露，很居少數。一大半人家，做慣了公債，做慣了地産，對此複雜煩瑣的工廠事業，那裏肯冒險從事，人情趨易而畏難，走平路而避險道，見解部是如此。於是可憐的國貨事業，更没有後盾可資擴展。做工廠經理的，除了改進出品努力推銷以外，還要奔走經濟，籌畫欵項，這是多麽困難。所以銀行自銀行，國貨自國貨，銀行雖多，無濟於國貨事業。試看歐美日本，恰得其反，不但銀行界一致爲工業的後盾，即政府也是拚命的來帮助工廠，竭誠的贊助工業界時時在設法推銷出品的機會。以日本國貨事業的發達，政府和銀行，還拚命的贊助，所以今日的日本貨，在世界能猖獗如此。可憐的中國人只有空喊空鬧，於實際的國貨事業，没有多大好處。現在連喊的鬧的也没有聽到，一批一批的劣貨，明目張膽的在通商大埠發賣，華北一帶，尤滿布日貨傾銷的現象。上月二十七日天津電，名古屋的商品，在天津陳列，參觀的十分擁擠，一二日間，有十萬元交易的可驚。以極低廉之價格誘致華人，所以歐美僑商，亦因本國産品，不能和日貨競爭，都來改換商標完全販賣、貨，這是多麽傷心的事，即是上海一埠，没良心的㚥商販賣日貨，更是變本加厲，貪了一些金錢，出賣自已的人格，聽說就疋頭魚類兩項而講，上個月中已達五百萬以上。這是誰的責任？一般人還是裝聾作啞，哀莫大於心死，中國人上海人苟有血心，難道竟坐以待斃麽？唉！國貨年，國貨年，唱得很高，而結果如此，我們不要責備没廉恥没良心的㚥商，還是責備自已當初定這國貨年時，爲什麽不定一個有系統有組織的整個計畫出來？計畫怎樣？横的怎樣分區域，直的怎樣分時期，以什麽做中心，以什麽作後盾，也要有一個統制的策略，并且要照三址一日本報東京電日本經濟侵略長江一帶的辦法才是。</p>
<p>日外務省通商局，鑒於對華貿易之無統制，故謀結成對華輸出組合之意見，較爲有力，同時爲中國中部排日貨運動牽制，於輸出組合成立之時，注重長江一帶。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>統制經濟與國貨事業</h3>
<p>— 俞洽成</p>
<p>統制經濟無論在攻或守的意識上，都含有建設的意義，而建設的目標，雖然是國家經濟，但是建設的基礎却是民族資本。當然，我們的民族資本，除去土地生産以外，在這工業化的現代，自然不能忘記萌芽期中的國貨生産界。所以，中國不實行統制經濟政策則已，如果在統制經濟的旗幟下，忽略了國貨生産界，那便小能獲取到牠的圓滿的結果。</p>
<p>我們認識目前中國的急務在謀農村復興，可是中國農村復興和發展中國國貨生産事業都有打不脫的因果關係。在今年國貨運動開始的時候，我們曾提醒過提倡國貨母忘救濟農村，時至今日，我們却不能不高呼復興農村應不忘提倡國貨了</p>
<p>這是很淺顯的，中國農村經濟的没落，雖由於天災人禍的直接原因，可是，癥結所在，還不是金錢遭國際資本主義的呑吸以至枯竭，而經濟的貧血狀態的形成，社會上的吸血病菌却是舶來品，所以，我們就是指牠們是我們的病源亦無不可。於此，在重圖復興農村之今日，我們得明白農村没落的眞因，更明白國貨生産事業和提倡國貨運動對於應付舶來品的意義和價値，那末，我們懲前毖後，自然明白民族資本的重要，祇有提倡國貨，才可避免經濟的吸血菌丨丨舶來品。</p>
<p>換句話說，所謂復興農村的目的，在重建設農村經濟，而農村經濟昭蘇以後，如果仍留着舶來品的傾銷，爲外國貨去開發市塲，固然是不値得，而且早先安置下重新破産的病菌，以待經濟的血球再被吸竭。統制經濟的最要目的，在求自給自足，於擴大國家財力以前，先注意於保全旣存財力，而使社會趨於安寗：所以，在整個的努力方面，我們於復興農村時更不應忘去提倡國貨。</p>
<p>因爲國家資本民族資本是整個的，農村的畸形發展和都市的畸形發展是一例的没有佳果：農村的生産品多是要都市的承售，中國農産品如果不用作中國國貨事業的原料，在世界不景氣中固然不可能，而低價用作舶來品原料也失去復興農村的意義。然而，要得都市能承售農産品，正如國貨的廣大市塲是農村一般，這是相互有密切關係的。</p>
<p>復興農村和提倡國貨是有相互因果的關係，祗有在統制經濟的通盤籌劃下才可以獲得合理的調劑。所以，在目下統制經濟的聲浪中，我們高呼復興農村母忘提倡國貨，同時也自已提醒，提倡國貨母忘復興農村。</p>

<h3>怎樣到鄕村去提倡國貨</h3>
<p>— 李伯黍</p>
<p>介紹采橋農民合作社</p>
<p>見前期黄影呆「鄕村與國貨運動」一文，大抵是說我們應該到鄕村去提倡國貨。他說中國鄕村也正在被洋化的時期了，一班農民也學着戴禮帽，穿嗶嘰褲，總之是在慢慢的洋化着。如果這洋化的勢力漸次擴大起來，將來一定非常危險。我看了，立刻就發生一個欵問：怎樣到鄕村去提倡國貨？固然，我們一方面應該到鄕村去宣傳關於提倡國貨的重要，但是宣傳的効力，我始終以爲是没有實地去做的收効大，故本鄕丨丨采橋丨丨在最近兩月間籌辦了一個農民合作社。我認爲這個合作社，是推銷國貨的最好工具。因爲農村離城市較遠，購買甚不便利：况且農民一到城市中，見到五彩六色價廉物美的仇貨，很容易遷心就意，不知不覺的去購買仇貨了。所以到農村中去開設合作社，國貨是必然能暢銷的。</p>
<p>這農民合作社，最初是幾個熱心國貨運動的同志籌備，後來徵求農民自願加入數股，每股一元，最後竟超出一千多股，於是就悉心籌辦，完全採辦一切爲農民實用的東西，並以國貨爲原則。果然，在九月十號開始營業，似覺非常妥善。至其辦法，是以最廉之價將貨購進，再將原價略微提高，售與農民。至年終結束一次，將所有盈餘之百分之六十爲購買紅利，以購買之多少分發該農民：百分之三十爲股員紅利，照股分發，而百分之十，則爲地方上之公益事宜。總之，此農民合作社，對於農民簡接直接都有很多的益處，同時也就是到鄕間去提倡國貨的最好工具！熱心提倡國貨的同志們！采橋農民合作社是農民合作社的先聲，我們從速起來繼續組織，使牠逐漸普遍起來，並且還要負着改良的責任，使牠能逐漸的發揚光大起來。這是我極誠的希望着，期待着。</p>

<p>自從前年九月十八瀋陽日寇變作，士大夫太息痛恨，㚥商則彈冠相慶，因屯積仇貨之機會已到，待國人五分鐘熱度一過，仇貨水銀瀉地不脛而走，最足以反證鐵一般之事實者，莫如上海三陽等十空襪廠，大買仇紗，冒我申新人鐘牌，鬧得烏烟瘴氣，結果雲散霧滅，現在又有愼豐米行等八家販買仇米案，逆風一來，浪高十丈，激剌社會，恐結果亦將如前者之同一覆轍丨</p>

<h3>爲實行專任制度告省立中等學校敎職員同人周佛濤</h3>
<p>江蘇省立中等學校、自本年度起、一律施行專任敎員制度、此於吾蘇敎育前途、所關至鉅、故特略貢數語、以告我敎職員同人、</p>
<p>年來蘇省中等敎育、賴敎職員同人之力、差幸已漸入正軌、日趨進展之途、然一考其實際、則距理想之域尙遠、故欲改革能達其根本、發展能期其健全、則對於諸君子今後之努力、不得不致深切之看望、而如何能使諸君子專心致志而無所係累、更不得不爲確切之籌謀、因念財政窘困、生計艱難、服務敎育者、或不免因生活之係累、而紛其心志、故不佞於經費萬分支絀之時、排除萬難、實行專任之制、於任務則定平允之程限、於薪俸則謀可能之增益、蓋必有安定之生活、方能專一其心志也、其所規定、在個人視之、雖未必極尊崇優遇之禮、然就公家而言、則每歲因此而增之費其數蓋已逾十萬較諸地方小學之敎師、甘苦固已懇殊、卽與一般公務人員之减俸相較、待遇亦屬不同、庫帑已空、措　匪易、事實所限、凡所以爲諸君謀者殆已畢盡於此、區區苦衷、當爲諸君予之所共諒、所望體念時艱、竭盡心力、以學校爲家庭、以學生爲家人予弟、以改進敎育爲一已專責、相與共謀根本之改革、而遂其健全之發達、則引爲慶幸者、又豈僅不佞一人而已哉、</p>
<p>居今日而言根本改革、舍端正學風充實學力而外無他法、故不佞於上年旣頒敎訓合一辦法、以爲轉移學風之規範、復於今歲訂定各科敎學進度、以爲提高程度之準繩、創制之初、幾經研討、復廣諮訽、固已竭盡愼始之道矣、顧良法之行、端在人力、警如行舟、製作雖巧、苟舟人不能致力於駕駛之方、亦終無由顯其濟川航海之用、是故　立而欲其必行、行之而欲其有效、則一視負推行之責者努力如何而已、</p>
<p>敎訓合一與敎學進度、二者均爲蘇省首創之規制、且爲今日改進敎育之根本、成敗之績、當爲全國之所瞻視、行之而能成功、則中國敎育、可開新生之機、行之而歸失敗、則中國敎育、難獲改進之望、中國敎育興廢之所關、亦卽諸君子榮辱之所繫、此中利害、寗俟多言、且敎學而不問訓管、授業而不守定程、豈惟畸形、直是痼疾、迄今不除敎育破産、可立而待、諸君體騐已深、當必同韙斯論、故凡規制之所定、原屬固有之職能、返本更始、固應如斯、旣非例外之責任、亦非格外之束縛、幸勿謂繁劇難任、顧慮難週、而意存躊躇、但能竭個人之心力、自必有精神之安慰、能具力行之决心、卽可收感化之効果、樹人大計功在百年、不佞决不强人以難能、亦决不責人以速効、惟期以潛移默化之功、收漸進日新之績、而使學風日趨端正、程度日益提高、則所期已達寗有他求、</p>
<p>且敎育爲精神之事業、非僅謀生之職務、諸君子從事敎育有年、平日所志、必有其遠且大者、斷不至以待遇之厚薄、爲努力之標準、而明達宏遠之士、更必能於顚沛困苦之中、樹堅貞卓越之節也、不佞誠不願以督責二字、施於諸君、而私心所企望者惟求諸君子一奪其自動服務之决心、共完成改進敎育之重大使命而已、瀝懇而言、幸共鑒焉、（二十二年十月）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「新師說」異議</h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>前幾天在「自由談」下方看到「決瀾社啓事」之後，再找出魏猛克先生的「看決瀾社畫展」一文來讀了，不禁有點感想，以爲像魏猛克先生那樣的口吻，非但失去了批評者的正態，而且不免有點像是現代智識階級中的輕薄青年。但昨天又在「自由談」上看了子時夏先生的「新師說」，覺得這正如豐之餘先生在「撲空」一文中所說的，「在中國社會上，實是一個嚴重的問題了。」</p>
<p>于時夏先生的文章一共三段，第一段是說明「師」本來並無可尊的性質，所以傳統的尊師論實在是「君師主義」的作祟。第二段是說師往往因弟子技優而忌弟子，反之，弟子亦往往有因技不及師而忌師者。第三段則說到魏猛克先生的事情了，作者將魏猛克先生之「輕視其師」，輕輕加以寬容，理由是因爲「猛克孟晋」：而對於「決瀾社啓事」則評之爲：「似有嫉忌其弟子之隱」。而結尾更大有鼓吹魏猛克先生謝本師之意味了。</p>
<p>現在讓我們先看魏猛克先生的大文，魏先生對於決瀾社諸畫師的那種把「紅花綠葉」畫做「綠花紅葉」，水菓與曼陀鈴放在大烟囱旁邊的繪畫簡直以爲没有方法能夠了解，所以他所最贊譽的祗是劉獅的一幅畫着一個工人的畫，我對於繪畫雖則是門外漢，但他們師弟之間的殊異是分明看出了。再看決瀾社的啓事，明明說出了「並非欲以師輩前輩資格眩耀……」，不過因爲魏先生文字中有「決瀾社是」羣青年藝術學徒所組織的畫社」一語而深致不滿於魏猛克先生。</p>
<p>在這樣簡明的事實中，決瀾社諸君並不是「好爲人師」，彼此亦並不是忌才嫉能，至於「猛克孟晋」，「輕視其師之言」，祗能將魏猛克先生的大半篇文章充數，而「決瀾社是一羣青年藝術學徒所組織的畫社」一語，不得與焉。</p>
<p>「韓愈謂世無仲尼，不當在弟子之列」。我相信確有此語，但韓愈「非生而知之者」，難道他没有啓蒙識字之師嗎？我以爲美術專門學校，雖曰專門，實在是藝術的啓蒙敎育，魏猛克先生想必總在美專裏從鉛筆繪木炭　學起的，則決瀾社諸先生可以說是魏先生的啓蒙師，將來魏先生的繪畫也許會（或者現在已經是）超過他的師畫，但他總不能反對他在美專練習的鉛筆繪木炭繪罷。</p>
<p>我們可以因思想學說之不同而謝大學裏的敎授，但絶不能因自已學問增長而不承認中小學的業師。魏猛克先生可以批評決瀾社諸先生的繪畫不好，而不能說「決瀾社是一羣青年藝術學徒所組織的畫社」。現在魏猛克先生竟這樣說了，我以爲這是魏先生自已暴露了他的」輕薄」：于時夏先生不認清事實，反爲魏先生張目，要他「謝本師」，而不知章太炎周作人之例不適用於魏猛克，我以爲這將給許多輕薄青年以藉口，鄙薄其啓蒙師，這是社會中一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<h3>凝視</h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>道塲做完了以後，就是焚化銀錠。</p>
<p>那時雪停了，風却括得更起勁，那可怕的呼嘯丨</p>
<p>我們聚在一個給廢棄久了的曠場上，悽凉而且沈默。這裏到處是衰敗了的枯草，你一踏上去，就是滿鞋的泥濘，冷冰冰的。雪雖則落了幾天，可是在這泥水横流的地方，怎麽也是聚不起來的。所以如果你不看四周圍的雪景，只在這塊荒地上走，那末你所能感到的，也只是雨天的情調。</p>
<p>小溪流得很遲緩，雪塊儘從山上滾下來，阻塞了溪水的流動。那遲鈍的，憂鬰的聲音，使人悵然地想起春天陽光底下的，輕柔活潑的潺湲。</p>
<p>村子沈默着，在四周，誰也聽不到一點聲音。山是黑巍巍的，彷佛在跟着黑雲飄搖。</p>
<p>火花飛舞着，焰頭向各方面直伸出去，銀錠快要燒完了。</p>
<p>我們大約有十多個人，全是素衣白帽，束着粗麻繩，踏着草鞋，悽凉而且沈默。有時大家團團的園住火堆，有時又散了開去，撒着放在圍裙或者口袋裏的白米，打着圓圈子，一轉又一轉，在冷風中抖着，喊着，念着經咒。我的前面就跑着素仙，她時常掉過頭來偷看，我却撒米在她的臉上和裙子上。如果不是焚銀錠。或者死了的不是我的老祖母，我們這對頑皮的小孩子，也許在這人人感到悲慘的時候，會在寒冷中緊緊的擁抱起來。</p>
<p>可是你看我那可憐的祖父丨</p>
<p>他傴僂着。手擎着一根竹棒，翻弄着銀錠，使它快一點燒光。一面翻，一面他喃喃的向着火堆說：</p>
<p>「這點也帶去，老老，半路上缺用不得了呵！」</p>
<p>過了一刻他又說：</p>
<p>「膽子大一點，不會有人搶你的，你的兒孫全在身邊呢。」</p>
<p>他向前注視，全神凝集着，昏花的眼睛彷佛發光了。他看着那一頁頁，在火光中飛舞着的冥銀，一動不動的，屏息着呼吸，魂不附體的樣子。他像看見同他過了二十多年生活的老妻，就在他的面前站着，慢慢的數着銀子，取走她到冥府裏去的　賢。</p>
<p>「統統都帶去，你一生辛苦，現在也得多帶一點兒去了。」</p>
<p>他咳嗽，全身震動着，冷風顯然吹得他的骨頭也碎了。但他還是凝視着火堆，失神地，似乎在這深沈的凝視中，他看見了白髮，皺紋，給生活壓彎了的身體。彷佛她了在咳嗽呢，低啞而且艱澀。那聲音他是聽慣的，在這二十多年共患難中的每晚，每晨。</p>
<p>慢慢地，慢慢地，他跪了下去。他伸着手，像抓住什麽似的，不斷地打着手勢。銀錠已經燒完了，火光漸漸地熄滅下去，半燒燼了的箔片隨風飛舞。他的雙眼緊釘着一張比較大的冥銀，彷佛那是老祖母的靈魂，那片冥銀飛到那裏他的眼光也跟到那裏。我們勸他回家去，可是他聽不見，儘是惘然地向着那片冥銀飛去的方向凝視。</p>
<p>「慢點走，老老，不久我也要走了，在那兒等我呢？」</p>
<p>他不動地看着，看着，可是除了雪，冷風，燒燼了的灰堆，他看到的只是一生的空虚。…………</p>
<h3>遊了佛國</h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>丨旅途隨筆之一</p>
<p>花了不到一星斯的時間，我走遍了被稱爲佛國的普陀山。我問自已我究竟得了什麽，自已却不能夠回答。</p>
<p>我不是一個拜物敎徒，也不是一個山林隱士，更不是什麽達官貴人。我伴了幾個朋友到普陀來，不過是想在友誼裡消耗一點我的沈悶的光陰。所以在居留的幾天裡我就整天没停過脚步，一定要走到了身子疲倦脚趾疼痛的時候我纔慢慢地走回寄宿的那個寺院去。朋友們也和我一樣。</p>
<p>每天早晨天剛亮，我們就起了床。窗前遠遠地立着一匹高山。那上面　疏的長了些樹木。這山，看樣子是有些峻險的，但牠並不曾給我們遮了陽光，反而看見陽光那樣燦爛地照耀在牠上面，我們就起了活潑，輕快，喜悅的感覺。環境是很靜的，小鳥的不十分吵鬧的呌聲，突破了夏天早晨的沉靜的空氣。</p>
<p>吃過早飯我們六個人穿上麻線鞋，拿了一條毛巾圍在頸上，就向着新的路線出發了。一個朋友拿着地圖，他就做一個指導人。别的朋友又帶了照像鏡。我呢，我只預備着兩隻脚跟着大家瞎跑，爬山的事情本來是我最歡喜的。</p>
<p>我們都没有到過普陀，這算是第一次。地圖自然不會準確，在中國人根本就不注意準確這兩個字。地圖往往會呌人走錯路。我們也曾有過這經騐。但這一次我們倒没有感到什麽困難。路是不難辦認的，路旁又常常有到某寺，某禪院去進香的指路碑。</p>
<p>同路的没有女人，朋友Ｔ的母親和妻子另外坐轎拜佛去了。自然大家都走得很快。花了一個半天的功夫，我們暢快地遊完了前山，給二龜聽法照了相，還在盤陀石上睡了一覺。下午天氣變得更熱了，在太陽下面走路就有些不舒服，兩隻脚也感到疲倦了，我們便回到寺裏去吃飯。路旁有不少的轎夫向我們兜生意，坐轎的客人的確不少，但是我們每個人都有兩隻脚，我們都還没有患過癱病，我們當然只有讓我們的雙脚把身子槓回去。</p>
<p>在寺裡睡過午覺醒來，時候是三四點鐘的光景，我們便又約好一道兒出去，到海灘上去洗澡，或者爬到岩上去捉動物，那里有賣咖啡的帳篷，我們就把外衣鞋襪都寄存在那里，在海灘上玩得疲倦時，就回到那里去喝汽水。</p>
<p>第二天就遊後山，日程和前一天差不多，只少了一個Ｔ，他陪他的母親坐船到洛迦山拜佛去了。那朋友是個科學家，人又很天眞，他第一次與和尙見面，就痛駁了佛家的道理，幾乎和那和尙爭吵起來。但是爲了滿足他的母親的多年的心願，他這一次也只得犧牲了同遊後山的一點快樂，到那充滿了烟露和香客的洛迦山去了。那山上没有廟，只有一些茅棚，他就在茅棚外面整整站立了大半天，看着他的母親在裡面燒香叩頭。這一次我們遊了梵音洞，和昨天遊潮音洞一樣，我們所得到的只有失望。在那地圖上印得有「普陀名勝　要」，人就把潮音洞和梵音洞形容成了非常神奇的地方。據說有好些虔誠的拜物敎徒到了那地方就會「眩目震耳，悖魄墮魂」，甚至會「投崖碎體，求生凈土」。但是我們去到那裡就只看見一些破屋舊洞，並没有什麽奇暴的景象，一些嶮峭岩石高聳在海邊，刮風的時候，海濤怒吼起來，不住向岩石撞擊，有時打進了洞裡，於是水花在石上四濺起來，人靠着欄竿看下面，也會感到一點興味。但這樣的景象在别處海邊也可以見到。我們的失望並不是没有原因的。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（十六）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>筆爾出門後，便向巴黎路走去，這條路燈光燦爛，市面繁盛，人聲嘈雜，是哈佛爾的主要的馬路。海濱㣲凉的空氣輕拂着他的臉孔，他慢慢走着，手杖掛在臂上，兩手剪在背後。他覺得自已不大舒服，步履沉重，好像得到了甚麽不好的消息一樣，心裏感着不滿。他腦裏並没有什麽明確的念頭使得他煩苦，他自已開頭也說不出這種身心兩方面的不快究竟從何而來。他覺得有個地方有着毛病，但又不知道究竟在什麽地方：他身上有着一個小小的痛處，一個差不多覺察不出的傷痕，人們雖找不出這傷痕的所在，可是這傷痕却使人窘促，疲倦，悲痛，惱怒，這是一種不認識的輕微的痛苦，一種悲哀的種子似的東西。</p>
<p>當他走到戲院前面的廣場時，他覺得自已受着托爾托尼咖啡店裏燈光的引誘，於是他緩緩地向那明亮的門面走去：可是當要進去的時候他想到他會在那裏遇到一些朋友，一些熟人，一些必得和他們交談的人：於是他對於這種平凡的小茶杯和小酒杯的交誼，突然感着厭惡。他回轉身再走上那條把他引在碼頭的主要的馬路。</p>
<p>他心想：「我究竟要到什麽地方去呢？」一面却在尋覓一個他歡喜的，可以使他的精神狀態愉快的地方。但他尋不到這樣的地方，因爲他旣生氣自已不該弄到孤零零的，他又不願意碰見任何人。</p>
<p>當他走到那大碼頭時，他還躊躇了一次，隨後便轉身向堤岸走去：他選下了孤獨。</p>
<p>他在防波堤上觸着了一條木橙，他便坐下來，他已懶得走了，他還没有散步之前，便已感着厭倦了。</p>
<p>他心想：「我今晚到底怎麽的？」他便在回憶裏思索自已究竟有什麽不滿，好像對一個病人查問發熱的原因似的。</p>
<p>他具有那種容易受剌激同時又善於反省的氣質，他熱中地想着，隨後又很有理性地推究着，贊許或責難着自已的興奮：但他的本性究竟强過理智，尙感覺的他始終壓制着尙理智的他。</p>
<p>他這時在思索着自已這種萎靡，這種什麽都不希望而需要動的心思，這種想遇見和自已意見不會一致的人的要求，以及對於自已或許會遇到的人和這些人或許會對自已說出的事物的厭惡，這種種情緒究竟從何而來。</p>
<p>他自已提出了這個問題：「這是不是因爲哲安得到遺産的緣故？」</p>
<p>對啦，總之這是可能的。當公證人宣佈這項消息時，他曾覺得他的心跳得比平時厲害一點。不錯，我們是有時不能自主的，我們得受到一些自然且頑固的感動，我們對於這類感動是無法克制的。</p>
<p>他開始深刻地反省着這生理學上的問題。這由某一事實在那本能的生物身上發生的印象，同時在他身上遺出許多痛苦或快樂的念頭和感覺所引起的生理學上的問題。這些念頭和感覺是和那因理智的敎養變得比本身優越的有思想的生物所希求，所舉發，所判定的良好而且純正的念頭和感覺相反的。</p>
<p>他努力想要明瞭那受着一筆巨額遺産的兒子的心理，這兒子因爲有了這遺産便可以去嘗試那希求已久而被一個父親的鄙吝所禁遏的種種快樂。這父親雖是爲他的兒子所疼愛，但也爲他的兒子所怨憾。</p>

<p>麥市上下午開盤後各月份市面、均見慘跌此種跌風之嚴重、亦爲近來所罕見、因洋麥報價、雖祇芝加哥回跌五七角左右、實不能作慘落之根據、而跌風之盛、實爲外匯濫鬆、現麥可定、聞某廠已有二船成交、阿根庭及澳洲麥各一船、此項風聲一經傳播、人心遂大虚特虚、尤以遠期爲更甚、上下午各盤、似全爲賣方所籠罩、計十一月份較前月底跌九分、十二月份跌一角三分、一月份跌一角四分、二月份跌一角半、三月份跌一角六分、四月份初開四元零四分、收盤亦跌七分、現麥市面、大致平定、開和橋麥三元六角四分、沙市麥三元五角、計二千包、由福新辦去、</p>

<h3>古氣盎然</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>大刀隊的肉搏，我們總覺得有些見古氣盎然，幾乎疑心是在做着十八世紀的夢，却不料這些時竟覺得一切社會的現狀，「古氣盎然」的，竟所在皆是。</p>
<p>其間最古的，自　該推「黄河沿岸的水災」。人們瞧到黄河裏的水，一寸一寸的高上來，都急得瞪了眼，把脚亂跳，這分明是三代時，大禹尙未着手治水時的景况。</p>
<p>滿地的土匪，盤踞了山頭湖沼，招兵買馬，積草屯糧，合官軍開火。而此輩流寇，往往由幾十人，愈聚愈衆，到後來，幾夥合成一夥，居然抄着梁山水泊的老文章。</p>
<p>不是滿洲國獨立，便是蒙古人自治，藏兵進犯之外，再來一個回纒屠殺漢人。古時候不少番蠻進犯的玩意兒，正和目前的情狀，異曲同工，不過現在少了羅通，薛仁貴，以及楊家父子等。</p>
<p>漢口，據說新出了一批蝴蝶黨」，雖然强奸小學女生之後，還要把女生價賣，同古代的採花之後，一刀殺死」的淫賊白菊花，有些不同，但是包公再世，彭公重生，或許也得請五虎七俠去一辦。</p>
<p>至於小學生的棄家上峩嵋山修道，自然更不是這一個世紀裏所會産生的思想。</p>
<p>在這古氣盎然的社會中混，眞會疑心到自已是在做着二十世紀的夢，而不是二十世紀裏的人。但是飛機，大砲，一切科學的産品，都不絶地在我們眼前幌動着、那又怎麽一回子事呢？丨丨唔，這些在我們古國遺民的心目中，正如科學先進國的人民，觀「五十年後的世界」影片，没甚分别。</p>
<h3>金魚</h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>莊子和惠子在濠上觀魚的一段故事，我常常把來體味，覺得含有樂的哲學在裏頭：所以，我的羨魚之心，也油然而生了。不過，莊叟去過的老地方，丨濠上，此生是没有到達的希望。因此常想縮小範圍，養幾尾金魚來玩玩，來安慰安慰我的工作煩悶，偶然有閒的人生！</p>
<p>在求魚不得的當兒，恰巧有一位親戚從上海帶到不少金魚，他於是分贈我幾尾。我是高興極了，馬上預備清水一大缸，把金魚放下。它們因爲久困在長途旅行的水箱裏，所以，一經入缸，恍惚水國頓覺空闊起來，便優哉游哉，樂得不可開交：我於是乎也行了樂園的奠基禮。</p>
<p>聽說人類裏的管仲，具有富國强民的本領。草類裏的管仲，也懷有辟疫驅邪的能。治國我當然没有力量，只好去仰仗一般大人先生。那末，我家庭裏的水國，丨就是我的濠上，這統治的責任，任憑没有能力，總是推諉不去的了。</p>
<p>曾經養過金魚的人把經騐告訴我：水國裏也有時疫的，拿魚最易沾染道　毛病，大槪水質不清潔的綠故。你如向藥店買一支管仲，放在缸裏，或者可以避免的。我照辦以後，成績不差，金魚的健康，至令還是保持着。我這水國統治者，似乎比治國者有面子些，不覺露着得意之色丨</p>
<p>每天晨起，總是要到我的濠上去觀一下魚。見到牠們穿着美麗的衣裳，在水裏套圈子，出風頭。遇到異性，也緊緊地追逐，不肯放鬆。有時載沈載浮在獻着那游泳的絶技，搖頭擺尾很有矜炫的神氣。有時碰到吃的東西你爭我奪，毫無退讓的餘地。它們一切的一切，居然也合乎時化的摩登啊！</p>
<p>「是魚樂也，」觀魯的樂的哲學，原來如此如此，我已領悟不少了。</p>
<h3>海京伯馬戲的小史</h3>
<p>— 坤元</p>
<p>從前在電影院，瞧見獸片「虎嘯獅吼」，令人咋舌稱奇。原來德國某馬戲班，有猛虎二十六頭，獅二十五頭，都是兇猛異常。班中有個名喚「傑克」的，能夠訓練獅虎做戲，奇險莫比。幕啓，獅虎都從鐵柙出來，一隻隻使它蹲在椅上，雖然有的張牙舞爪，吼聲如銅鉦，崛强地不聽傑克指揮，後來經傑克一手拿了鐵椅，一手拿了電鞭，終究指揮到椅上去，個個柔馴和小綿羊一般。傑克又能把猛虎，在塲上左右前後的打滾：要是我們來訓練貍奴，恐怕還不能這樣的。小說裏說武松怎樣在景陽崗上打虎，已令人佩服到五體投地：豈知這位外國武松，眞是神仙中人物，不是一位伏虎大仙嗎？現在上海新到的「海京伯馬戲班」，也有這　本領，自然要轟動全市了。</p>
<p>海京伯馬戲中，不雌老虎跳火箍一幕，兇猛的雌老虎，誰不見了嚇落膽。現在要請牰來跳一回火篐，牠却情情願願的跳着。這不但是一件奇事，也足以使觀衆裏面，久慴伏於雌老虎威下的朋友，發出無窮的感喟丨據說：海京伯原是德國的貴族，家很富有。他的父親，性喜畋獵，日積月累，家裏的奇禽猛獸，多得不可指數。當然囉，家裏變成了一個規模宏大的動物園。空的時候，又把這些動物，來訓練玩弄，不多時，便成功了一個雛形的馬戲班，不過在貴族家庭裏玩玩吧了。有一天，他老人家，訓練一頭猛虎，把自已的頭顱，伸進老虎嘴裏去：不幸那虎獸性發作，把他老人家咬死了。在我們貴國人的心理，抱了「明哲保身」的宗旨，當然要從此不幹這危險事情了。豈知海京伯並不如此，繼續了他的父親志願，依然天天馴練猛獸，經過無數危險，吃過多少苦頭，到如今成了世界第一的馬戲班，可不是徼倖的事啊！</p>
<h3>敎育電影</h3>
<p>— 江如松</p>
<p>近來很有不少人提倡這個「敎育電影」。</p>
<p>要把電影作爲輔進學校敎育與國民敎育的工具，將敎育的功能無形的潛伏在電影裏。</p>
<p>它的目的，不單視電影爲一種消閒的娱樂品，更要把它變成一把鋼刀，利用這鋼刀去開拓敎育園囿的荒萊。</p>
<p>這提倡是應該我們與以相當注意的。　　不過，敎育包含的範圍很廣，至少，對於德，智，體，三者都要顧到。譬如一個學校裏造就出來的人材，不僅要有充實的學問，更要兼有偉大的思想與健全的體格，這三者之間斷不能忽略了任何一點。</p>
<p>但是，咱們影壇上所努力獲得成績又是怎樣？</p>
<p>無疑的，一向很少注意，最近才把方向轉到這個上面。</p>
<p>最近，全國運動會在南京舉行，各家影片公司爲着這是有關於體育的新聞，都派大批隊伍前往拍攝，聞說，明星公司曾以遲緩動作Slow　Motion的拍法，攝成不少有聲影片，目前正在明星戲院出演。那裏面有各種田賽，徑賽，球賽，游泳賽種種姿態活躍的表演。在我們民族需要以鐵血洗刷恥辱的今日·像這種電影的提倡於我們是極需要的。願全電影界瞄準這方向奮進，爲我們多拍攝一些關於有敎育意義的影片。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫壻怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>江氏一進門來，那雙眼睛，早就射到了趙自强的身上。趙自强也不解是何緣故，見了這位岳母，情不自禁的，立刻就兩脚一併，作了一個立正的姿勢。對他是要表示恭敬，而同時也是要表示有點不安。江氏道：自强，我聽說，你們軍隊要出發了，你怎麽也不早早遞一個信回來？自强點着頭道：倒是要開拔了，不過並不是開到什麽戰地裏去，是開到喜峰口去堵口子。江氏對於堵口子這個名詞，似乎還有點不明白，便道：堵口子，怎麽樣子堵法呢？爲什麽要去堵口子？趙自强心裏這就想着，若說堵口子，就是防禦敵人的意思，那一定會把丈母娘嚇倒，不如含糊其詞的，不必說明。便笑道：您這有什麽不懂的。譬如說罷，北京這内外城，有十三道城門，處處的城門，都得派軍隊和警察把守。這萬里長城，也有許多城門，這就呌口子，我們就是調到這口子邊去的。江氏走進來，在椅子上坐下，這就望了趙自强笑道：你這話我就明白了，凖是把你們調去守城門，有什麽來　　　，你們都得盤問盤問，是不是這個樣子呢？趙自强道：對　，就是這個樣子，您想，這不是很太平的事情嗎？江氏望了他許久，然後搖了兩搖頭道：說起來，我這話顯得囉唆，可是我也就眞不明白。把守城門，幾十個人輪流着來，也就儘夠的了，爲什麽要調着整萬的人去堵口子呢？趙自强這却想不出一個好解釋來答復，便笑道：那當然不止一個城門。趙翁道：這您就不必多心了，我想着，那一定是很太平的。江氏什麽話也没有回答，兩手按　膝蓋上，微微的昻頭歎了一口氣。（二二八）</p>

<h3>桂花的類别</h3>
<p>— 沛聯</p>
<p>桂花是木樨的俗稱，一名嵌桂，這是常　亞喬木，所以　院多栽植的，葉爲椭圓形對生，秋日葉腋難生小花，花冠下部連合。</p>
<p>桂花是依開花次數多少而分别的。有三種：就是年桂，四季桂，和月佳。</p>
<p>年桂，一年内正式的只開一次花，大都在陰歷的八月裏開，也有在七月的後半月就開的，也有到了九月才開的，正式開花以後，兩星期内又會重開一次，這呌做「二桂，」花朶是很少的。</p>
<p>四季桂，春夏秋冬各都開一次，如果培植得不周到，不能每季都開。</p>
<p>月桂本是每月都會開的意義，但每月都開的很少，實際上和四季桂差不多的，</p>
<p>年桂所開的花很多，月桂和四季桂都很少。　　從所開的花的性質而論，桂花又可分爲三種：金桂，銀桂，和火桂。</p>
<p>金桂的花色深黄，氣味香，花汁淡。銀桂的花色淡黄，氣味與花汁同金桂差不多。火桂的花色紅，氣味也很香，花汁是苦的。</p>
<p>金桂和銀桂的花都可以吃，可以做桂花糖，桂花蜜，桂花茶葉，桂花蜜糕等，火桂的花，因爲汁苦不能吃，幹兒長得不十分高，可是很好看，可以種在盆裏，可給我們做觀賞品。</p>
<h3>憶桂花嶺</h3>
<p>— 黄克威</p>
<p>桂花香的時節！在街頭，在賣花女的竹籃裏，放着那小小的金黄色的桂花：清淡的香味，跟着秋風一陣一陣地吻着臉兒，眞夠醉人哪！</p>
<p>嗅着桂花的香味，不由得使我憶念起故鄕的桂花嶺來。</p>
<p>桂花嶺上有幾百枝桂樹，一到秋天，嶺上便充滿了淡薄的清香，就是幾里路外的村落裏，也可以嗅到這兒送去的香味：遠遠地望去，那尖形的綠葉下，像塗着一片黄金，如果給太陽一映射，更可顯得光彩耀目。</p>
<p>我愛桂花。我也愛孤獨，每當黄昏的時候，總獨個子踏着殘陽的餘暉，緩緩的步　嶺去，躺在樹下閱讀小說：直到父親來喚我去吃夜飯，才拍拍身上的殘花，乘便折了一枝，拿回家去挿在那隻長頸藍花瓶裏。</p>
<p>到了深秋，嶺下的居民丨桂花的主人公，便提着籃去採摘，不過採花的時間一定在晨光熹㣲的清早，據伊們說：</p>
<p>「花朶吸了夜露水，又香又嫩，如果給太陽照過就要乾枯了。」</p>
<p>這大槪都是女人們的工作，但我也曾參加過一次。我興奮地爬上樹去折，露水像雨點樣落下來洒了一臉，連衣衫也有點兒濕了，但我並不氣餒，反而感到一種清凉的暢快。</p>
<p>伊們送給我一小籃桂花，我高興極了，連忙呌母親去買了白糖，一同拌好，放在玻璃瓶裏，緊密地封了口。記得那年新年，我大嚼一頓桂花白糖年糕哩！</p>
<p>可是這甜蜜的童年時代，像流星般飛走了，流浪在大都市的我只有嗅嗅賣花女的竹籃裏的桂花香味呵！</p>
<p>是桂花香的時節啦：在故鄕，桂花嶺也許依舊那麽繁盛，採花的娘兒們也許依舊那麽興奮，但那雙長頸藍花瓶裏，一定没有人會去插丨枝金黄色的桂花了！</p>

<h3>體育的大衆化</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>現行的，以錦標競賽和運動會爲主要之表現形式的體育，是久已被人們加以歪曲和利用而失去其根本意義的。現代體育之最主要的流弊有二：一·運動對於少數「錦標專家」的偏在，二·以英雄主義和過度的剌戟爲骨髓。</p>
<p>久矣乎，我們從若干「體育主義」者們的口頭或筆尖之下，「領敎」了許多說來「頭頭是道」之關於體育問題的「說敎」。自然囉，用「千百年非一日也」一類之當然的，公式的話來談問題，是和用冰糖蒸生梨來治咳嗽一樣，五百年也不會出毛病的！譬如說：體育應該在德智體羣四育之中，佔最基本的重要，這話當然是無可非難的，又如說「强國必先强種」，也是「有至理存焉」。然而間題的關鍵就在這裏；一·中國摹仿錦標競賽，鬧着「三育」，「四育」，前後不下三十年，何以結果這個「國」和「種」不但不「强」，反而弄得每况愈下，終至被「友邦」硬挖了一大塊去做「滿洲國」？二·在河山破碎，外侮日深的現階段，單只提倡體育這一項，是否可以代替我們爭民族最後生存的反帝政治任務之全部？就前者說，三十年來不斷有「空前成績」的體育和運動，對於「强國强種」的帮助，畢竟是微乎其微，這失敗的癥結，當然不在體育的本身，而是說明過去提倡體育的對象和方式，都曾犯了很嚴重的錯悮。就後者說，顯然無論在理論抑或事實上，都「通」不過去；因爲任何「友邦」之對中國「零宰」或「獨佔」，都是靠了鐵騎唐克戰艦飛機和操縱自如的政治控制，絶不是靠了某幾個「打破世界記錄」的「選手」呀！</p>
<p>關於現行體育之錦標主義和過度拚命的流弊，在六七年前就已經有許多進步的青年加以很嚴格的批評和反對，直到最近，我們也時常聽到反對畸形體育的呼聲。然而唯其如此，若干「民粹主義」的「衛道之士」就藉着錦標體育之缺點的暴露而遂行其「李代桃僵」的宣傳和實踐，即妄想以「國術」來代替體育。或使「國術」與田徑賽來「平分秋色」這種「向後轉」的傾向是無待指摘的，正如我們不能因爲反對高跟皮鞋而主張恢復「三寸金蓮」一樣！</p>
<p>本届全國運動會雖然蔚爲空前之盛並表現出青年界之畸形的活躍，但在十日的競賽過程中，却十足地顯出錦標主義體育的根本缺點：一·錦標優勝者，一大半是「久歷戎行」的「老將」，而「後起之秀」，非常之少。這並不是說明若干老資格的選手永遠是「超羣絶倫」，而是證明體育生活對於少數錦標專家的偏在，因爲青年的大多數事實上是與體育和運動隔離，所以就不容易産生「後來居上」的錦標獲得者。二·有些省區的選手和觀衆·竟爲了爭細微末節的上風而大「打出手」，這鐵樣的事實，證明一部分的選手和觀衆充分發揮於全運大會之中的，並不是「民族精神」，而是「地方主義」！</p>
<p>我們站在國民大衆的立場和增進國民健康水凖的觀點，一方面應該很堅决地促成現行的畸形體育之改造，同時尤須從多方面之實際鬭爭中努力，來實現體育的「大衆化」！</p>
<p>大衆化的體育絶不是以製造少數「打破某項記錄」的「英雄」或「怪傑」爲能事，而是從鼓勵提倡各界人士之普遍經常的健身和運動入手，以增高國民之健康的水平綫。大衆化的體育决不是以少數經濟條件優裕的少爺小姐爲基本隊伍，而是以廣大的農工商學界和一般自由職業者爲對象。大衆化的體育必須洗剔一切出售門票，禁止工人市民入門之「高尙」的雰圍而給與任何人以參加體育生活之很便利的條件。</p>
<h3>火車和汽車兩名詞的糾正</h3>
<p>— 長素</p>
<p>在二十世紀的今日·科學發明，眞是多極，什麽電話·電報，飛機等等，都給我們莫大的便利。至於火車和汽車，更勿說了，在光緒二十幾年，上海已有火車的踪跡。汽車雖是較遲，但在光緒末葉，大約也到中國了。</p>
<p>好管閒事的我，平時對於一切事物，都喜作一番探究，這裏，火車和汽車錯誤的兩個名詞，便是我探究的一個發現。我們常見火車隊燒爐之外，並没有火，但是我們何以呌他做火車呢？再看汽車，只是斷續的放出黑烟，决不能找得一團蒸汽，但是我們何以呌他做汽車呢？所以我信這兩個名詞，定爲錯誤，在糾正這錯誤之前，確有把兩種車的構造情形，作簡單說明的必要。</p>
<p>我們知道，火車的原動力，産生於蒸汽機關，他是利用蒸汽作功的機械。其中主要的部分是；汽罐及備有活塞的圓筒·汽罐盛水，下受猛烈的燃燒，熱度漸增，水漸變爲蒸汽，於是發生作用推動活塞，作直線的往復運動，又連上種種傳動的裝置，使他改作旋轉的運動，這樣，火車便自能行動了。</p>
<p>再說汽車的原動力，是産生於内燃機關，他是利用燃料的爆發而作功的機械。其中主要的部分是；備有活塞的圓筒和飛輪，燃料直接在圓筒内燃燒，因燃燒而體積脹大，推動活塞，這圓筒原是兼汽罐及圓筒之用的。通常都用四衝程機關，裏面包括飛輪（連結活塞」的轉動，活塞的起下，混合氣體及廢氣的吸收和排出等動作，這樣循環不斷的動作，汽車於是行動了。</p>
<p>由上面看來，蒸汽機關的燃燒，是在圓筒之外，所需的能（Energy），是汽罐供給圓筒的，所以火車除燒爐以外，都充滿蒸汽，不見有火。但在内燃機關，燃燒却在圓筒之内。燃料一經爆發，便産能推動活塞，所以圓筒之内，盡是烟火，在全部内燃機關中，找不出一團蒸汽。</p>
<p>但是，我們分明知道前者的能，取之於汽，何以把他呌做火車呢？又分明知道後者的能，取之於火，何以把他呌</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>做汽車呢？老實說來，這却是從前命名的錯誤，現在我們旣知道這兩個名詞的錯誤，便應糾正過來，把現在充滿了汽的火車，改喚汽車，充滿了火的汽車，改喚火車，庶幾可使各個的名實相符，不致張冠李戴了。</p>
<h3>登高</h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>龍山落帽，千古韻事，然而上海是濱海之區，一片平原，却是無高可登，我想重陽令節，没有辦法，祗好化二毛錢去登登永安公司的屋頂以應應景兒了。　　前數天閉幕全運會的舉行地的中國的首都，山是很多的，最便當的是城中心「鼓樓」左近的「北極閣」，「鷄鳴寺」就建築在東北麓，紅樓一角，頗饒異趣，城西的「清凉山」，雖然瑰奇，不過太荒凉了；而最雄偉，最著名，古跡比較的多，游人比較的衆，那還是要推中山門外的「總理陵墓」一帶。</p>
<p>記得去年的重陽，我那時飄流在南京，借着世俗的習慣丨「登高」的題目，約了幾個朋友，雇了一架「摩托」，興緻勃勃地，去過我們的共同的「玩與游」的癮。</p>
<p>那時那汽車在「中山路」上疾馳着，南京的路上所特有的灰土，隨着車輪向後面向兩旁抛出去，抛上了人家的屋頂，抛上了行路人的臉面，攪得白色的陽光變了黄色，萎而無力；攪得來往的人把手帕掩了口鼻，揩着眼睛；我挾着「報復」的念頭，我滿意了，我傲然的笑了。</p>
<p>一向在路上迤邐走着的時候，被别人蹂躪慣的，今日一旦而蹂躪别人，心中怎不快意呢。然而，此時想來，頗失悔我那時心旌的卑鄙，因爲，自已旣然是從「被蹂躪」裏跑出來的，便極應當知道他們的苦處，由憐憫而生同情，進一步而謀解除：那時不此之圖，反因能蹂躪别人而生快意，眞是多麽卑鄙齷齪的心理啊！我於今失悔了。</p>
<p>汽車在「中山路」上疾馳着，由六十碼放到八十碼，凉風從前面襲來，又從兩旁邊散過去，車裏的人都靜默着，汽車夫揑定了駕駛輪，兩眼注定了前面，全神貫注着，隨着崗位的指揮，大轉灣，小轉灣，表演着他特有的技能，快而且穩。當然，南京的路祇有「中山路」比較値得稱道，是犧牲了許多民房築成的，汽車在這上面走的時候，没有絲毫的顚簸，舒服極了。然而也惟有在汽車中方始覺得它的好，惟有在汽車中方始享受得到這種「舒服」，今日我是已經充分的領略到了。</p>
<p>車子在靜的奔跑中，忽然「叭，的一聲長號，原來是已經到了「中山門」了。於是我們便計議着，最後是决定先到「明孝陵」。</p>
<p>我們吩咐着車夫，車夫噭然應了，車子一出中山門，却不向「柏油路」上跑，向左一拐灣覺得顚簸得利害，没有先前舒服了，向前一看已走上了石子路。時序雖已到了深秋，路旁的樹林尙未盡凋零，車子在這裏而走着，覺得非常的富有詩意。一會見到了，於是一個一個跳了出來，Ｔ君首先摸出錢來開發了車夫，車夫駕着車一溜烟走了。於是我們便有說有笑地在一對對的「翁仲」中間走着。明初到現在，已有數百年了，石硺的「翁仲尙矻然立着，最奇怪的是在「翁仲」的脚邊發見點殘的香燭，封建剩“前驅”一并被利用的工具</p>
<p>餘的貴族裝飾品·到現在已成爲游人賞玩的古跡了，料不到尙有人去當他做泥塑木雕的「神靈」丨而焚香頂禮的虔誠拜禱着丨國民的敎育程度的不夠，儘夠人嘆息的了。</p>
<p>明孝陵遠着像一個城堞·要到上面去必須要經過一條深長的「墜道」，背後便是鍾山，那裏面也有賣各種古特的，如古錢，古瓷，古碑帖等，但這許多似乎不是我們幾個窮小子所需要，並且我們的「目的」也不過「逛逛」而已。</p>
<p>窮一天的工夫，游過了「明陵」，雖過了「總理墓」，到了烟霞洞，瞻仰了靈谷寺，雖然犧牲了不少的精力，却換回了無限的樂趣。</p>
<p>但是今年，飄流到上海來了，喧囂的上海雖然有水的秀荑，但總不及雄壯多山的南京，而尤其在這登高的重陽令節。</p>

<h3>不能苟合於世</h3>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>我們這公司裏，原有經理副理各一；因爲經理先生事忙，不常來此，所以一切均由副理料理。這位副理，性好拍馬吹牛；一般同事，都是没有骨氣的，於是把他們大部份的精神，用來迎合這位副理先生去了。獨有我却不能與他們苟合；除了把經理先生委我做的事務，照章做完之後，此外可就不管了。因此與同事們毫無接洽，覺得像魯濱孫在荒島上一樣，孤寂極了。先生，我對於同事們的這種態度，究竟對不對？如其對的說話，那末應當用什麽方法來調濟我的孤寂？如其不對的說話，那末又應該怎樣呢？請你指敎我吧！專肅順請撰安　蓋民椿謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：一個人做到與世不能相合，何論如何，是不對的。獨夫這兩個字，决不是一種好名稱。</p>
<p>蓋君的地位，看來與經理先生多少有一點淵源·你看公司裏的一切，都由副理作主，獨有蓋君的事務，却由經理直接指定。因此我們很疑慮，蓋君或者就爲了這一點，目空一切，而不願與同事多所接洽。若果爾者，那末蓋君就很危險了。一方面做了衆矢之的；另一方面，促成公司内部的渙散，間接有負經理的知遇。這是我們以小人之心，來度蓋君的過慮，希望蓋君有則改之，無則加勉。</p>
<p>退一步說，即使蓋君的人格，確是孤高，同事的行爲，的眞卑鄙。我們也不能贊成蓋君這種態度。蓋君應當在時時提防，不爲同化的條件之下，與他們多所周旋，相機去同化他們。我們不需要一意鳴高，獨善其身的高士。我們需要自已捨去太子的尊嚴，來普度衆生的釋迦。</p>
<p>驕與傲都是造成不能與世苟合的原因：這兩個字，在個人私德上，後者自勝於前者萬萬，但是在團體生活中，却都是必須戒絶的。我們勸你多看些關於修養的書籍，這　以慰藉在孤寂中的你：並且還可以保障你，祗用同化他人的份兒，而没有被人同化的危險。</p>

<p>兵庚：天哪，戰爭，戰爭，帝國主義的戰爭，多殘酷呀丨人們受傷了，哭，現在連馬也得哭，難道馬也犯了罪嗎？</p>
<p>兵乙：那末我們又犯了罪嗎？爲什麽也得死？</p>
<p>兵甲：他發瘋了。</p>

<p>兵乙：我們正是以戰爭來消滅戰爭，我們是以革命民族戰爭來答覆帝國主義的侵略戰爭。</p>
<p>兵庚：不，不管怎麽的，我們不需要戰爭！</p>

<p>電影專刊</p>
<h3>「挖」不加「捆」</h3>
<p>— 不敏</p>
<p>聽說近來自從某新公司出現之後，上海的電影同業之中，就發生了一個軒然大波。記者靜處編緝室中。對於外事，本不過問，不過這次却無可避免地受了這軒然大波的波及了。上月二十九日本刊登了一段天一公司所發出的消息，大約說的是「天一近來因欲實現增加出品之計畫，添聘職演員多人·先有由明星轉入之湯傑與于定勛，繼續有强華轉入之曹雪松與余光。最近明星之王戲齋高梨痕·因合同期滿·亦與天一訂定正式合同，於十一月一日起加入天一。」云云。</p>
<p>當然，一個公司所發出來的關乎他們自已公司的消息，本刊是儘量登載而無需乎再推敲他的眞實性的。可是隔了一天，明星公司正式來函，要求更正了。那封信發表在十月三十一日的本刊。當時記者還想加一個註解，因爲那封來函所說的龔稼農，徐莘園·王夢右等的消息，本來申報電專没有登載過，壓根兒就母庸代人受過。後來一想，大可不必，因爲這星星之火，已大有燎原之勢：旁觀者說話，要不能排難解紛的話，反而容易引起誤會，使事態更加複雜起來，因此就照原文不加註解的登出來了。</p>
<p>今天本刊又登了一封天一公司的正式來函，除聲明王獻齋確已與該公司正式訂立合同外·并且說許多職演員的加入天一，係自動的，而不是用「卑劣的手段」，向人家公司去「挖」來的。這樣一來，這「挖」的問題，可就擴大了。現在記者以局外人的態度，勸雙方從此罷手，因爲那總不大好聽吧。上海房子舖面可以「頂」，可以「挖」：這些演員們，不是標價待沽的商品，怎麽亦可以去「挖」的呢？要是不滿於一察人公司，而等待别家公司來的，那更不成話了。所以就相信他們的脫離某公司、加入某公司，都是出於自動的，而不是被動的。　　天一公司信，似乎有「扳倒賬」的意思、我想這點，亦大可不必。以前的一切，我們可以放棄前嫌。報復循環，又有什麽意思呢？我們現在要爲將來電影界全體安全起見，起來想一個善後的辦法。我想我們中國的電影界，已經不是草萊時代的東西了。我們要有一個聯絡影界全體感情的組織，去調和融洽各種紛歧的意見，我們還要有一個仲裁的關機，去調解判决同業中所發生的一切爭端。我不是說外國如何如何，好萊塢如何如何，顯見得我們中國一定樣樣要去學外國似的。不過我們對於這兩種組織，亦應當自動發啓起來。這是我在這個當兒希望於中國影業界的：至少是上海的幾個大公司，應當有這種組織，好像歐洲軍縮會議開不成，且先來一個四强公約！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「天之驕子」　　Darling　of　the　Gods</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>一、昔日的光榮何處去？</p>
<p>就我個人來說，詹寗斯往日的好成績，誠然，直到現在仍使我不能忘懷。他是舞台的巨匠，更是銀幕的驕子。特别是在默片時代，自「浮十德」中的魔鬼，「罪惡之街」的流氓，「最後之命令」的俄國將軍，以及「最後之笑」的老年侍役，都一貫的給與我們最深刻的印象，其表演之細膩，深刻，幾乎是値得一切美　的詞句之讚美，假使不能忘懷美國的約翰巴里摩亞或英國的喬其亞立斯以及卓别麟，同樣，我們對於這一德國的巨匠，决不至於不同時記起。可是自聲片奪取了整個影業市場之後，我們的天才表演家却跟的他的年齡而遺失了過去的光榮。在「慾潮」我們已經不能重看到如以前一樣的驚人之成績，直到這一「天之驕子」，更使我們失望了。自然，我們並不說後二者成績全無，但是較之以前諸片，却不免遜色，乃是很顯著的事實。啊！往日的光榮隨着流水逝去，將何處追尋？</p>
<p>二、他仍然是「天之驕子」嗎？</p>
<p>我們相信詹寗斯不會没有自知之明，如上述，他自已决不至於没有同樣的感覺。這由於這一影片的故事，我們可以得着明確的證實。當他在人們的熱烈擁戴之中，驕傲自得，威赫一時，及至在南美歌喉失去，雖因報紙的瞎宣傳而未損其榮譽，然自身從此挹鬰頽唐，無欵的不能不敎人們爲之惋惜。關於這些，我們知道了他自聲片風行而黯然自好萊塢師國的事實，誰也知道是爲他自身寫照。但是他不肯悲哀的追慕着往日的光榮，却振作精神，企圖恢復從前的聲舉，繼續他「天之驕子」之寳座。然而可憐得很，事實上非獨不能奪回這一寳座，反而有着漸次低落的痕跡。</p>
<p>很明白的，在這一影片中他的成績，的確没有獨到之處，充其量祇是由導演的指示而相當的盡職罷了。假使一定要給他找出幾個優點，那末祇有在南美化裝室中對鏡發見青春消失的時候，拉回歌唱候補者而憤然上台的時候，在舞台上神經錯亂而仆地以及在後台聽着候補者的歌聲，而凄凉的道出一他是年輕，他是年輕……」的時候。至於從醫生處聽着改換生活的勸告，而走出房門突然大哭，雖然很是賣力，却使人有着不甚眞切之感。他如後來在妻的鋼琴傍忽然再發現歌喉之存在，而歡喜若狂的時候，也不見如何了不起的特色。總之，在這一影片中，使我們對於藝人發生遲暮之感。比較「慾潮」亦覺不及。他不能再爲「天之驕子」了</p>
<p>另一方面我發現女主角麗勤瑪萊（RenateMuller）却演得非常成功。她飾一個賢淑的良妻，極盡温淑和顧之能事。在她這没有單獨描寫的情形之下，能有如此成績，眞令人欽佩之至。</p>
<p>但是詹寗斯於好萊塢之後起的代替他地位的人，却不免妒嫉，這在劇中由歌舞班經理嘲笑那意大利青年可以得着證明。丨假使這一影片眞的是他自身描寫的話。</p>
<p>三，高明的導演手法</p>
<p>故事已略如上述，顯然的一個平常而簡單的Storyo。但是在奇妙的導演之下，却使作品有着十分生動的成績。我想這一影片的價値，大半是導演的功績。</p>
<p>一，美國片如遇有大塲面的時候、一定要極力誇張·特别是Opera的塲面，更是極力的浪費金錢。但在這裡却看德國影片的不同點，導演對於大塲面却極力删去。如詹寗斯扮了一個東方貴族，我們想一定有大塲面出現，可是導演Hanns　Schwarz却緊接着火車的塲面。此外兩個舞台上的場面也只是劇情上有着必要，然而亦不過簡單的幾個鏡頭。至於那聲樂家的歌唱，差不多都是間接描寫。（也許那這歌並不眞的是詹寗斯自已唱的。）</p>
<p>二，導演對於劇情的確是支配得當的。如寫這一歌者之聲舉，而用許多人聽着他的歌聲便佇足諦聆。由經理桌上的風扇寫到南美的酷熱。歌者在心緒煩亂之下而聽着隔壁候補者之歌聲。由美回國登岸時，美婦人献花·歌者將花交其妻。歌者安間的擠牛乳時聽着留聲片中往日的歌唱。…………諸如此類，都是導演的成績。</p>
<p>三，至於在小的地方，我們可看到女人們排班等候歌者之接嚮，而居然有人預先塗口紅，以及老太婆之醜態。賢淑的妻送牛乳給丈夫吃，而丈夫却以之喂犬等。</p>
<p>四，導演對於演員的帮助，也是不可忽略的。最顯明是女主角能有如許成績，諸如在後面的彈鋼琴，火車站的泣别，輪船碼頭的等待，以及在輪船上熱烈的接吻等·都得着導演强有力的帮助。</p>
<p>四，此所謂之娱樂影片！</p>
<p>關於劇的整個的方面，我以爲這便是希特勒政權之下，所謂娱樂影片了。没有嚴重意義的故事，而充分的顯出内容的空虚。這固然是歐美影片一般的現象，但在這裡却不能掩飾它避免暴露社會眞實的企圖。</p>
<p>此外没有奇特的鏡頭，保持着純樸的氣氛。然而那外加的英文字幕，却不免擾亂視覺的統一。</p>

<p>因爲得着休息，大家没事的閒談起來。由於銀幕藝術而談到舞臺劇，由舞臺劇一會兒又談到穿衣吃飯，由穿衣吃飯一會兒又談到市上那一種生意好做。因此大胖子殷秀琴說做好生意是賣洋澄湖的大蟹，聶耳說是炒熱栗子，王琰說是賣菊花，邢少梅說是天要冷了，做好生意的要屬賣棉花的，各人都有理由，可是阮玲玉，好竟說是好做的生意　開個賣鹹魚的舖子，她眞滑稽，她的理由是因爲旁蟹栗子菊花……都不過是能做一時的好生意，賣鹹魚的是永久能有買賣的並且她還笑着說，鹹魚店的老板開銷也輕，開飯只要米飯不用做小菜，夥計們嗅着鹹魚味就可把飯吃下去了！」</p>
<h3>兩鉅片在急進中</h3>
<p>一九三三年度明星公司之三大生産影片，除「絲」之「春蠶」業已公映，且得佳評不少外，尙有「鹽」「米」兩片在攝中。「澉」卽徐欣夫導演之「鹽潮」，由胡蝶顧氏姊妹花主演？已三次赴澉浦實地攝製。日前，又整隊赴澉，拍完本片末次外景，「米」之「豐年」現由李萍倩率領大隊人馬赴蘇。一星期後始能完成外景工作。兩片將同時在廢曆歲尾年初公映。</p>
<h3>養成所人材輩出</h3>
<p>明星演員養成所，成立之初，有許多人以爲是明星當局的策略，可以有用之不竭取之不盡的臨時演員了，現在事實最難辯，設立演員養成所的目的並不那麽簡單。</p>
<p>最初便發現了男演員梅熹，李萍倩導演的「豐年」中，立即請他充男主角，並且又和公司當局訂了三年合同了，現在在演員養成所中又發現了一位有希望的女演員，呌做胡雯的。現在沈西苓導演的「上海二十四小時」中飾了一個很重要的角色。在這中國電影從業員的風狂雨吼的時期中，新的人材的陸續出現，正顯示出舊的設落與新的建設的對照來</p>
<h3>程步高之新作</h3>
<p>程步高導演自「春蠶」及「滿江紅」兩片先後公映後，在新舊社會交替期中，大受新舊人物各别的擁護。目下，正準備開拍新劇本「同仇」，内容不論新舊觀衆，均甚適宜。</p>
<p>「同仇」爲一戀愛革命劇。大致爲一下級軍官與一鐵道工人之女相戀，後此軍官因受另一蕩女之誘惑而棄之如敝屣。女忿甚，尋機謀報復。時義勇軍興。軍官赴前敵，適遇女，女本有機可乘，當發覺其捨身赴義，知爲同志，乃放棄私仇。</p>
<h3>吴村的舞塲巡禮</h3>
<p>聯華二廠的導演吴村君，大家都知道　　一　　常偉　　　　好的　　　。他雖然旅　多　，可是海上人士認爲最時髦最風尙的跳舞，他却不侖，偶然給人家拉到舞塲去，他也不過是靜坐在一隅，眼看人家興高采烈的舞踊，而探尋他自家的劇料畫料畫料而已。最近，我們忽然發現他連晚的在大滬大華辣斐等舞塲流連，且有時竟通宵達旦。起初我們眞以爲吴導演添上了這種新嗜好，但後來纔知道，他依然是探尋他的劇料和畫料。原因是他的「風」裏要拍製一個最偉大最重要塲面的夜花園，這一場戲是紳士太太，公子，小姐們享樂的大寫眞，他們和她們的淫靡，縱慾，墮落的種種都在這一塲面裏揭　無遺。我們知道，一個導演從實際的觀察而産有的思想，是十分寳貴。我們吴導演他很知道這個，所以在辛辛苦苦的工作之餘，還要跑到各舞塲去巡禮呢。</p>
<h3>韓蘭根演獨脚戲</h3>
<p>電影太監韓蘭根，我們知道他除了　於在銀幕上作滑稽的表演之外，還能登臺唱拿手好戲的獨脚戲，時常給人家請去義務登臺。現在韓蘭根的獨脚戲從舞臺演到銀幕上來了。日前他到聯華二廠，他本是在吴導演新片「風」中擔任一個汽車夫脚色的，只是他近日左足小腿上正生了一個挺大的癤而牽到全腿紅腫不良於行，到廠時是撑了一根手杖一蹺一蹺地踱着。據他自已的理解，戲是决不能拍的，不過非來一次給吴導演一個證明不呆，但是吴導演却說不妨，汽車夫儘可以坐在車廂　做戱，於是韓蘭根便不得不化裝上鏡頭了。他一隻脚是痛得不能動彈的，這正合着他的拿手本領演獨脚戲哩。</p>

<h3>盛筵難再Dinner　at　Eight（二）</h3>
<p>— 馬騰</p>
<p>派卡德的夫人名呌吉蒂，她現在着了燦爛悅目的内衣，倚在華美的床上。她那黄金色的頭髮，係由名手蜷的，嘴唇紅紅的，指甲亦是紅紅的。她那深籃色的眼睛，正可迷惑人的心竅。泰爾堡坐在床邊上，很不在意地手指頭搭着她的脈息，問着他：「我的小太太有什麽病呀？」吉蒂歎口氣說道：「我亦不知道丨祇覺得週身酸痛，怪難受的丨怎麽你總不來看看我，總要等我請了纔來呢！」泰爾堡道：「吉蒂，你不知道，我實在忙得不可開交。」吉蒂道：一但是我眞寂寞極了，温納，我一天到晚不做别的事，盡想着你呢！」她看着他，她那副如怨如慕，如泣如訴的神氣，任你鐵石心腸人，也要軟化的。</p>
<p>他門正說得情話綿綿的時候，吉蒂柔潤如玉的臂膀，已經套在泰爾堡的頸項裏了：而泰爾堡醫生呢，這樣假正經了一陣，亦就俯首就範，兩人緊緊地摟抱起來了。同時，却在另外一個地方，一個女子的玉臂，很不高興地從一個男子的肩膀上放了下來，因爲那討厭的電話突然嚮了。勞萊將聽筒拿了起來，寳勒在旁邊聽着。她在聽筒旁聽着那裏面是她母親的聲音，嚇得她心勃勃地跳。原來係她母親請勞萊到宴會。可是勞萊竟已經答應下來了。這使她太爲難了，她和勞萊的交情怎麽可以給人家知道呢！她喊着：「勞萊，你怎麽能接受那邀請呢？你怎麽可以到那個地方去呢？」</p>
<p>勞萊道：「爲什麽我不能去呢？」保勒躊躇着道：「唉，恩納斯亦要到的，他是我的未婚夫，我的父母所鍾愛的丨勞萊，你要是眞去的話，你千萬不可喝酒，你總要像樣些。」勞萊倒在一張椅子裏，似笑非笑地看着她。她呢，亦帶笑看着他。他祗看得見他那魁梧的身段，俊美的面龐：可是他經騐太淺了，她没有看得出他酒色所斷喪的身體，以及年齡及縱慾所留存的瘡瘢。她的愛情如同一股的熱流，將她浸沉在裏面，以外的一切好都顧不到了。她點了一支香烟吸着，她思盧了一陣說道：</p>
<p>「好了，好了，」她說，「我們談别的事罷。寳貝，你告訴我，昨天我們離别之後，你一天做些什麽？但在你没有說話之前，我先要你吻我，再吻，再吻。」勞萊道：「小寳貝，小心肝。」寳勒問道：「你愛我的，是不是？」勞萊道：「我崇拜你，我尊敬你！」寳勒歎了一口氣說道：「可憐的恩納斯，我一定要告訴他，拿這件事了斷了吧。」勞萊道：「那不興，你切不可道樣。」寳勒道：「我怎能不告訴他呢？我不告訴他，太對不起他了。說起來，眞奇怪。一個月以前，我覺得恩納斯多末可愛：而你呢，不過是一個値錢的電影明星而已。」她柔情脈脈地看着他。（未完）</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Takes Office at the Ministry of Finance; Accompanied by President Wang to Nanjing Yesterday Morning; Convenes All Staff for Instructions; Song Ziwen to Return to Nanjing in a Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi arrived in Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 1st, and after a brief rest at his residence in the Lingxin Village of the Mausoleum Park, he went to the Ministry of Finance at around 10:00 AM, accompanied by Secretary Tan Zhonghui, Zhang Ruizhi, Jiang Shouyi, Qiao Fuzhi, Jia Zhongfang, Meng Wenshen, Zhang Hancheng, Zhang Yuanzheng, Jia Yuesen, and over ten others. Vice Minister Li Diaosheng, representing Minister Song, welcomed him at the entrance and escorted him to the minister's office. After a brief rest, the seals of the Ministry of Finance were handed over. At 10:10 AM, he went to the auditorium and convened all staff. Vice Minister Li Diaosheng first introduced him, followed by Minister Kong's address, stating: (1) He was appointed by the Central Government to succeed as Minister of Finance. In the future, in addition to continuing the established plans of Minister Song, he will also design and plan for projects that Minister Song may not have considered. (2) Regarding personnel, everyone knows the relationship between him and Minister Song, so he will definitely not lightly change a single person. Moreover, he has always prioritized talent, and anyone with ability, regardless of familiarity, will be considered a comrade and colleague. He hopes that everyone will work with peace of mind and strive to assist the government. (3) All finance, whether domestic or foreign, is based on the principles of "increasing revenue and reducing expenditure." In the future, in addition to striving to reduce expenditure, he will ensure that the people are not burdened with increased taxes. Li Diaosheng then gave an address, stating that he was instructed by Minister Song to welcome Minister Kong and handle the handover. Therefore, he would like to say a few words of farewell. He has been in office for several years and has not achieved much. In recent years, he has often felt unwell and needs to rest. He had repeatedly requested to resign when Minister Song was in office, and Song approved it. Now that Minister Kong has taken over, considering his personal friendship with Minister Kong, he should have tried his best to help. However, his health cannot withstand it any longer, so he has firmly requested to resign to Minister Kong, but Minister Kong has not approved his resignation. Therefore, while meeting with everyone, he requests Minister Kong to approve his resignation and hopes that everyone will continue to work with peace of mind. (Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news from the Ministry of Finance, Minister Kong Xiangxi, regarding internal staff, apart from Vice Minister Li Diaosheng, who could not be retained, in order to have experienced personnel, he requested Political Vice Minister Zou Lin to continue his post. The position of Administrative Vice Minister will temporarily be held by Qin Fen, the Director of the Accounting Department. He also announced Xu Jianping as the Director of the General Affairs Department, Fei Qizhe temporarily in charge of taxation matters, Li Dang as the Chief Secretary, Tan Guang and Zeng Ke Duan as secretaries, Gao Bingfang as counselor, Yang Wen as a member of the Tax Commission, and Li Junyao temporarily assisting in the General Affairs Department. Zhang Guozheng works in the General Affairs Department. At 4:00 PM, the ministry hosted the press, with over 30 people attending. Kong said that the Ministry of Finance has a significant responsibility and that he knows his talent is insufficient to fulfill it. However, due to strong urging from all parties, he had no choice but to take office. In the future, in terms of financial management, he will prioritize increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Methods for increasing revenue include: (1) Economic construction to cultivate tax sources. (2) Finding ways to increase tax revenue, reorganizing old taxes to increase tax revenue, while not harming the people's vitality or hindering economic development. (3) Methods for reducing expenditure include not only tightening spending but also ensuring that expenditure is properly allocated and in line with economic principles. (4) Economic construction is to be managed by the National Economic Council. (5) Although Minister Song has resigned, he has agreed to assist the government, which is especially appreciated. (6) The personnel within the ministry will definitely not be changed lightly. (Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When Kong Xiangxi met with the press on the 1st, he answered reporters' questions, saying that Song's resignation was indeed due to financial difficulties. The rumor that military authorities wanted to use cotton and wheat loans, causing Song to resign in anger, is not true. The use of cotton and wheat loans for productive enterprises was advocated by Chairman Chiang during the Lushan Conference, so this rumor is self-defeating. Currently, the central government's income is approximately 17 million per month, with a shortfall of approximately 12 million. How to remedy this is still being planned. In the past, he had served as the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance and as acting Minister of Finance. When Minister Song went abroad, he also assisted in financial planning. Taking office as Minister of Finance, it would be an exaggeration to say that he definitely has a solution for finances, but he would not make irresponsible remarks saying that he has no solution. He came here with the spirit of a religious person, saying, "If I don't go to hell, who will?" As for how to increase revenue, he will respond after detailed research. (Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Zhaoming, arrived at Xiaguan on the morning of the 1st. Wang attended the Central Political Conference immediately after and told a reporter afterwards that after the resignation of former Minister of Finance Song, Mr. Kong Yongzhi has succeeded him. Kong has long served in the Ministry and is able to continue Minister Song's spirit in managing finances. This time, he went to Shanghai to meet with Song to discuss the progress of the National Economic Council. Song is still handling the handover in Shanghai and has not yet finished. Handover, whether for the new appointee taking office or the old one relinquishing it, must be completed with proper procedures. He estimates that in about a week, arrangements will be clear for him to come to Nanjing. Song has not expressed negativity towards his position as a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, as he is busy with the handover and has no time to consider it. Song is rich in a sense of responsibility, and matters such as the League of Nations technical cooperation and economic construction rely on Song's planning. Rumors that Ma Yinchu and Gu Mengyu will be added as members of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council are difficult to confirm at present. Shanghai's public debt market was indeed affected by the rumors of Song's resignation, but it stabilized immediately after the announcement of the successor. (Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 1st)</p>
<h3>Complete Withdrawal of Japanese Troops Within the Agreed Line</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Beiping, when the rebel troops of Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang raised their army, Japan dispatched the Saeda Unit to ensure their rear. They also deployed troops in Miyun and Shixiazhen. Now that they have finished organizing the accumulated military supplies, the Miyun Unit departed yesterday, and the Shixiazhen Unit departed today, returning to their original defense positions north of the Great Wall. Therefore, all Japanese troops within the agreed line in that area have been withdrawn. (Dentsu Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>Panchen Lama Sends Xia Kanbu to Welcome Huang and Zhao to the Temple; Mongolian Banners Organize Autonomous Government; Central Government's Plans May Need to Change; Huang Shaoxiong Cables Nanjing Again for Instructions; Huang Shaoxiong to Discuss the Geographical Scope of Inner Mongolian Autonomy with the Authorities of Chahar and Suiyuan Tomorrow; Prince Yun and Prince De Hope to Use the Daqingshan Mountains as the Boundary</h3>
<p>Guihua: Xia Kanbu, sent by the Panchen Lama, arrived in Suiyuan on the evening of the 31st to meet with Huang and Zhao, representing the Panchen Lama to welcome Huang and Zhao to Bailing Temple. Most of the representatives of various leagues and banners originally at the temple have returned to their respective leagues and banners. Currently, only a few people are staying there, waiting to welcome Huang and Zhao to the temple to discuss Mongolian banner issues. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Guihua: Huang and Zhao will go to Bailing Temple after Li Songfeng and others return to Suiyuan with their report, and will return to Suiyuan without much delay. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong plans to convene the chairmen of the Chahar and Suiyuan provincial governments in Suiyuan on the 3rd to discuss Inner Mongolian regional affairs. Song Zheyuan has ordered Qin Decun to go as his representative. Qin will go to Zhangjiakou on the 2nd and rush to Suiyuan on the morning of the 3rd to meet with Huang. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying went north from Nanjing and arrived in Tianjin yesterday. Qin Decun also arrived in Tianjin to meet with Song and report everything. That evening, Xiao and Qin returned to Beiping in the same car. This morning, he attended the regular meeting of the Military Branch and asked He for instructions on everything. He is scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou tomorrow afternoon. After a short stay, he will go to Suiyuan to meet with Huang. Regarding the geographical scope of Inner Mongolian autonomy, Huang will discuss it with Fu, Qin, and others. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Yueqing said that regarding the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, the Japanese side is deeply dissatisfied because the princes of Western Mongolia did not participate in the Eastern Mongolian Conference and are trying their best to sabotage it. The Red Party also covets Inner Mongolia because Outer Mongolia has already been seized, so they cannot tolerate Inner Mongolia advocating autonomy. It would be worrying if the central government does not understand Inner Mongolian autonomy. When the Panchen Lama went to Bailing Temple, he advised the princes. The Panchen Lama was urged by the central government to go to Nanjing after the meeting in Bailing Temple ends. Mongolians will definitely not participate in the central government's establishment of a Department of Border Affairs, because Mongolia has people, land, and a government, so autonomy is sufficient. The princes are also unwilling to be ministers. Zhangjia was blocked from entering Mongolia because his words and actions were inappropriate. Most Mongolian intellectuals value politics, while the ignorant value religion. Currently, Mongolia is ruled by intellectuals rather than the ignorant, so they must still value politics. It is not necessary for Zhangjia to return to Mongolia. Li Songfeng and others will go to Bailing Temple and will return to Suiyuan after staying for a week. He is waiting for Huang and others in Suiyuan, and after meeting with He, he will go to Suiyuan and then to Bailing Temple. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Someone involved in Inner Mongolian affairs said that when the princes of Inner Mongolia held a meeting in Bailing Temple, Durlun also convened a meeting of various leagues and banners, sending people to ask the Silingol and Ulanqab leagues to select representatives to participate. The Silingol and Ulanqab leagues immediately rejected it because the other side was purely created by the Japanese and was plotting to invade the west. The Japanese side was quite dissatisfied. This Inner Mongolian autonomy is indeed due to the worsening environment and is a national self-determination to protect the territory. They are determined to implement autonomy under the leadership of the central government, not to secede from China. The scope of the autonomous region and all matters will be resolved after Huang and others arrive at Bailing Temple. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, Inner Mongolia has recently dispatched a large number of cavalry, distributed along the Mongolian-Han border, to strictly guard and inspect passersby. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pi lian were ordered to inspect Mongolia and contacted the Mongol princes staying in Beiping. Originally, they planned to pass through Suiyuan, stay for a short time, and then go to the Silingol League to guide Mongolian autonomy. However, Fu Zuoyi, the chairman of Suiyuan, held some objections to Mongolian autonomy and presented his opinions, intending to offer them to the central government for reference. Therefore, Huang and Zhao have recently stayed in Suiyuan, earnestly consulting with Chairman Fu, hoping to reach a considerable understanding before entering Mongolia again to further discuss with the princes of various Mongolian banners. Furthermore, the principles of Mongolian autonomy previously decided by the central government were to guide the Mongolians to organize local autonomous administrative organs of Mongolian banners outside the provincial and county systems of Chahar and Suiyuan, but foreign affairs and military affairs are still directly under the jurisdiction of the central government. According to the current situation, it seems that there are slight differences from the original plan of the central government. Therefore, Huang sent a telegram to the central government on the 31st, reporting the situation of the Mongolians, hoping that the central government would consider it and issue guidelines to serve as a standard for discussing with the Mongol princes when they arrive at Bailing Temple. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong cabled from Suiyuan to Beiping, saying that he is preparing to go to Bailing Temple. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy is being manipulated by only a dozen princes. If handled properly, it may not expand. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Suppression of Bandits in Eastern Luan Begins with Heavy Weapons; Heavy Mortar Units Transported to the Front; Zhang Xiguang Oversees the Attack on Funing City; Li Jichun Resigns as Chairman of the Miscellaneous Army Training Committee</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The provincial government has decided to annihilate the bandits in Eastern Luan with heavy weapons. In the morning of the 1st, a telegram was sent to Gao Deyi, the captain of the security squadron stationed in Yangcun, ordering him to lead a heavy mortar unit of 200 men, four heavy mortars, and more than 30 horses to Changli. Jin Dingzhou, the captain of the security brigade stationed in Jinghai, was also ordered to lead his unit of over 200 men, over 200 horses, and four field guns to Changli. It is expected that Zhang Xiguang, the commander-in-chief, will supervise his troops to launch a general offensive on Funing City on the evening of the 2nd. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Changli: The bandits in Funing had minor disturbances again on the morning of the 1st. The bandits' attitude is still very stubborn. Chief Li, who was sent by Commander-in-Chief Zhang Xiguang to the front to discuss the issue of surrendering weapons, returned to Changli from the front on the afternoon of the 1st due to his evasive attitude and reported the progress of the negotiations to Zhang. The heavy weapons we added have been shipped from Tianjin on the afternoon of the 1st. If there are no obstacles along the way, they can be transported that night. Tomorrow morning, there may be fierce fighting in the front. According to Zhang Xiguang, the problem of Eastern Luan cannot be delayed, causing the people not to be able to live in peace soon. Now the bandits' attitude is stubborn and cannot accept the provincial government's policy of leniency. They have no choice but to resolve it with the final plan. It is expected that there will be new developments within three to five days. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ariyoshi is scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 8th to discuss the issue of Eastern Luan with Nakamura. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Jichun has telegraphed He and Huang on the 31st to resign from his position as chairman of the war zone miscellaneous army training committee because his mission has come to an end, and has requested the return of outstanding funds for closure. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Tianjin, several artillery units are currently heading to Eastern Luan to suppress the bandits attacking Funing and other places. It is heard that after recent consultations between the Chinese and Japanese military authorities, the attitude of the Japanese has changed greatly compared to several weeks ago. At that time, when the Chinese Special Police Force carried machine guns and several small-caliber field guns to Eastern Luan, they were forced to retreat by the Japanese army.

<h3>Headquarters Broadcasts Bandit Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The headquarters broadcasted the bandit situation yesterday. The pseudo-First Army Corps harassed Shangcunwei and was defeated and retreated to the southwest. On the 30th, the pseudo-Fifth and Seventh Army Corps fled and attacked the Shanghang position and were repelled. The main force of the pseudo-First Army Corps and a part of the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps were in Dongping Zhongxian on the border of Lichuan and Guangze. A part of the pseudo-Third Army Corps is still in Hufang on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian. Parts of the pseudo-Fifteenth Army Corps are staying near Fanjiayuan. The pseudo-Seventh Army Corps is in Daxiao Zhutongbu. The bandits constantly use guerrilla tactics and have been repeatedly defeated by us. In addition, they have no salt to eat. The air force is constantly scouting and bombing. Zhu and Mao are extremely panicked. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The headquarters received a telephone report from the front saying that after the officers and soldiers of the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps were defeated by our army, they fled to the Zixi area. Now they are feeling the pain and are also becoming more aware of the advantages and disadvantages, and are determined to surrender to us. They plan to request the printing and distribution of propaganda to encourage them to return as soon as possible. Upon receiving the report, the headquarters ordered the commanders at the front to properly receive the officers and soldiers of the Communist department who surrendered, and plans to hand over eight types of leaflets to the Third Air Force Team, which will send aircraft to distribute them in the Jinxi and Zixi areas immediately, so that all officers and soldiers of the army corps will become fully aware and actively surrender.

<h3>Japan's National Policy Coordination Movement</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Under the stimulating call of the so-called "Second Extraordinary Period," Japan has recently launched the so-called "National Policy Coordination Movement."</p>
<p>The "National Policy Coordination Movement" is obviously due to the instigation of the young officers of the military. The intention of the young officers of the military is to use this movement to coordinate the various political parties internally and to win over the various financial groups in order to implement the so-called "national consensus." Externally, they also want to use this movement to establish their "national defense first doctrine" so that they can thoroughly implement their propositions. Therefore, the essence of this movement is still a manifestation of the young military officers' efforts to expand their power and of Japan's increasing tendency towards dictatorial politics.</p>
<p>Indeed, judging from the international situation, Japan's situation is becoming increasingly difficult. Relations between Japan and the United States are strained. Relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are tense. Relations with Britain have soured due to its withdrawal from the League of Nations and have resulted in direct conflict due to dumping and underselling. Nearly all those standing side by side with Japan are its enemies. Therefore, it is not wrong to say that this is Japan's "extraordinary period." However, this situation is entirely caused by the militarist policies of the Japanese warlords. Instead of urgently seeking a fundamental solution, they still want to use national policy coordination to implement their propositions. This is like scooping water to stop boiling, so how will the so-called national policy break this extraordinary period?</p>
<p>When Saito and the various political parties began to discuss national policy, the Seiyukai independently submitted five proposals to the government: to reorganize the army and navy, to establish diplomatic guidelines for countries other than the League of Nations, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, to complete the economic integration with "Manchukuo," to improve the education system, to stabilize the financial base, and to increase exports and reduce imports. These proposals can be said to have accommodated the will of the military as much as possible. Wakatsuki, representing the Minseito, focused on the deficit financing. In his speech to the Diet, he said, "The emergence of a deficit in finance is a sign of national demise. Filling the deficit is the most pressing task." He also said that Italy in the past suffered from military expansion and heavy military spending, and a satirical cartoon in a certain newspaper depicted a skeleton dragging a large cannon, which is quite similar to the current situation in Japan. Wakatsuki's intention was probably to express his dissatisfaction with the arrogant behavior of the young military officers in Japan and to be deeply concerned about the exhaustion of financial resources, so he used this cartoon to express his satire. However, the young military officers were determined to go their own way without any regard, insisting on unifying finance, economy, military affairs, and diplomacy. Araki, the Minister of War, once told reporters that he would save Japan with artillery fire, and said, "If the government authorities do not realize it, I have my own determination. Why bother talking about shirking responsibility? If each cabinet member can understand this internal and external crisis, national policy will naturally be decided." Araki's opinion implicitly meant that even if Japan became a skeleton, it would still drag a cannon forward. Therefore, he still insisted on his propositions in the five-minister conference, resolutely proceeding without any consideration.</p>
<p>In the five-minister conference, Japan's so-called "national policy" has already been determined in broad outline. Almost all military, diplomatic, and financial matters are decided based on the propositions of the military. Takahashi, the Minister of Finance, did express opposition to the expansion of armaments based on financial considerations, but ultimately succumbed and stopped. From then on, the young military officers of Japan can be even more arrogant and do whatever they want. The Daily Telegraph, a British Conservative Party newspaper, published an article saying that in a few months, the Japanese cabinet will be entirely composed of army and navy personnel. Is its statement an oversensitive speculation?</p>
<p>However, Japan's finances are now showing a thousand holes, and the collapse of the countryside is enough to make this deficit financing a permanent state. The army and navy departments also have huge new demands for the next year. They are draining the pond to catch the fish in order to expand their armaments, and their expansion of armaments is aimed at the hypothetical enemies of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain. If one of these three hypothetical enemies actually becomes a frontline enemy, will Japan implement its scorched-earth policy at this time, dragging a cannon with a skeleton to fight, or is it confident that it can win? Now, in this forward-rushing, mad state, is there anyone who is sober-minded and deeply considers this dangerous juncture?</p>
<h3>Inspection of Troops Stationed on the Ping-Sui Railway Completed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The 3rd Route Inspection Committee, led by Director Men Zhizhong and Chief Committee Member Yang Zhen, and over 20 others, previously departed for the Ping-Sui Railway to inspect the troops stationed in Chahar Province.

<h3>British Ambassador Lampson's Farewell Message to China; His Hopes for China: Advance Towards the Path of Peaceful Unification and Construction</h3>
<p>(Beiping) British Ambassador Lampson said that he is scheduled to leave China on the 28th by ship from Shanghai. He has been stationed in Beiping for over ten years, and Beiping is almost his second hometown. He is not without emotion when leaving China this time. During these ten years, China has undergone major changes, which he has witnessed. The revival of China's national thought, progress in education, industry, commerce, and the development of various raw materials, and the growing interest in sports are all evident. However, it would be a pity if China's politics cannot make the same progress as other aspects. He is most satisfied that he is leaving China at a time when Sino-British relations are harmonious. The two nations have many points in common. Based on sincerity, mutual respect, and mutual understanding, he has sought to promote the friendship between China and Britain, and he is very pleased that the situation is unprecedented. The two countries have the same political interests. Britain has absolutely no political ambitions in China and hopes that China will be strong and stable so that British commercial development in China can flourish. His farewell message to the Chinese people is that he hopes China will advance towards the path of peaceful unification and construction. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Sun Dianying Requests the Issuance of an Explicit Order to Temporarily Station on the Border of Ningxia and Suiyuan, Designating Pingluo to Be Assigned to the Unit for Defense</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is impossible for Sun's troops to move west, as proven by many sources. Sun recently stated to the authorities that if he cannot move west, then temporarily stopping on the border of Ningxia and Suiyuan is also acceptable, but he hopes to be given an explicit order. In addition, because it would be difficult for the unit to be fully stationed in Wuyuan and Linhe, he requests that Pingluo on the border of Ningxia be assigned to the unit for defense. The authorities have not yet made a decision on this, because it is necessary to consult with Yan. Therefore, they have telegraphed Huang, asking him to go to Shanxi to meet with Yan after inspecting Inner Mongolia to discuss everything. Song is in Tianjin for treatment of his back pain and has requested another week's leave from the Military Branch. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Discussion by an Official of a Certain Diplomatic Authority Regarding Japanese Diplomacy: Tokukawa and Sugimura's Visit to China Did Not Involve Important Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An official of a certain diplomatic authority stated that recent changes in the international situation have considerably impacted peace in the Far East. However, our country should strive to extricate itself from this environment and restore its original international standing. We must not harbor侥幸 sentiments due to changes in the international situation. Judging by the situation on both sides, there is currently no expectation of resolving the Sino-Japanese Incident, as Japan's occupation of the Eastern Provinces is something our country will never abandon. If Japan fails to understand the international situation, willingly destroys peace in the Far East, and does not abolish the puppet state under its protection, then the Sino-Japanese Incident will never be resolved. It is reported that the visits to China by Japanese envoys Tokukawa, Sugimura, and others were merely ordinary meetings, without any important negotiations or secret dealings. If China and Japan were indeed engaged in some kind of contact, the government would follow formal procedures, make a decision through the central government, and announce it to the people. Regarding the bandit suppression problem in Luanzhou, the central government has telegraphed the military and political authorities in North China to take responsibility for handling it. Whether or not it can be suppressed will depend on whether Japan and its puppet regime secretly assist the Luanzhou bandit army. (A Special Telegram from One Day)</p>

<h3>Litvinov Quietly Leaves France for the United States: The Ship He Took is Kept Secret. Short Stay in Paris to Discuss Trade Treaty with Peng Gu. Unwilling to Express Opinions on the Future of Negotiations with the United States</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Soviet Ambassador to France has announced that Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov departed this morning for the United States to discuss the resumption of diplomatic relations with President Roosevelt. However, because Mr. Litvinov does not want the outside world to know his whereabouts, the Soviet Embassy refuses to announce whether he took the French ship "Champlain," the German ship "Bremen," or the American ship "Berengaria." (Havas Telegram from One Day)</p>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov no longer conceals his whereabouts and is currently residing here, waiting for a ship to the United States. Today, he met with French Foreign Minister Peng Gu to discuss the possibility of concluding a new Franco-Russian trade treaty. However, the discussion was only about general principles and did not go into detail. It is expected that as a result of today's talks, the two countries will soon send special envoys to engage in negotiations. Mr. Litvinov will likely take a ship to the United States within the next day or two to discuss the possibility of resuming diplomatic relations with the US President. Mr. Litvinov and his entourage are unwilling to express what attitude they will take towards the debts of the Tsarist and Kerensky eras in the future, only hinting that such issues will be discussed by Mr. Litvinov and the US President in the future. The content will not be released until both parties agree or fail to reach an understanding. (National Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>Stockholm The Swedish people are paying close attention to the negotiations between the Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and the US due to the hope that the Soviet Union may compensate for the assets of American people confiscated in the past. Because if the Soviet Union satisfies the creditors of third countries, then Sweden can invoke the 1924 Swedish-Russian agreement to demand the same treatment. (Havas Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<h3>US Newspapers' Answers: Majority Advocates Recognition</h3>
<p>(New York) US newspapers were solicited for answers regarding the issue of recognizing the Soviet Union. These answers have been compiled, published, and sent. A total of 1,139 newspapers responded, of which 718 advocated immediate recognition, 21 favored conditional recognition, 306 opposed recognition, and 86 did not express an opinion. The request for answers was sent out before Roosevelt and Kalinin exchanged letters. Many newspapers that originally opposed recognition published articles in favor of recognition after the exchange of letters. The Hearst newspapers have firmly expressed their support for recognition after the exchange of letters. Some newspapers publish lengthy articles every day describing the vast potential for the development of Sino-US trade, and the number of newspapers supporting early recognition has been increasing since the exchange of letters.

<h3>Far East Peace Conference: Germany Supports Araki's Proposal</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German semi-official political circles are now supporting the proposal by Japanese Army Minister Araki to convene a Far East peace conference, saying that peace in the East has a significant impact on countries that are not directly related to that part of the world. This kind of conference is of great value in promoting the Nine-Power Treaty, the Washington Naval Treaty, the London Naval Treaty, and keeping Japanese policy within the scope of international politics. Japan's proposal to negotiate a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union is also taken very seriously, because Japan had been lukewarm when the Soviet Union proposed negotiating this treaty last year. The Berliner Tageblatt believes that Araki's plan is actually intended to counter Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov's visit to Washington for negotiations. (Reuters Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the recent proposal by Japanese Army Minister Araki to convene an international conference in Tokyo to discuss Asian issues, the "Political Foreign Correspondence" here expresses its support, believing that this proposal is very concrete in form. It says, "Japan's proposal is quite interesting and, in nature, is an attempt to explore the situation. Its fate is such that it is too early to predict it. Whether the four points proposed by General Araki can serve as the basis for a future international conference, we will not discuss for the time being. However, Araki's proposal, from now on, is still at the core of the current situation and future development in East Asia and the Pacific." (Havas Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that Army Minister Araki did not mention the proposal to convene an international peace conference in Tokyo at yesterday morning's cabinet meeting, nor did he discuss the issue with Foreign Minister Hirota. Unless Araki formally proposes this, the Foreign Ministry will not pay attention to it. (Reuters Telegram from the 1st)</p>
<h3>Japan Fears Aerial Bombardment: Navy Ministry Denies Abolishing Submarines</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday's Daily Telegraph reported that the Tokyo government had recognized the principle of abolishing submarines. British officials and those responsible in Japan both replied that they did not know. The Daily Telegraph has now published an editorial stating that, according to "Japanese officials," the Japanese government has recently approved the principle of conditional abolition of submarines. "The Japanese Navy and some influential people may advocate preserving submarines, but as far as the entire nation is concerned, they are particularly afraid of aerial bombardment. The Japanese government, under the supervision of public opinion, is prepared to support proposals to avoid this kind of bombardment, because enemy aircraft must be carried by aircraft carriers to fly to Japan. Therefore, abolishing aircraft carriers is the semi-official exchange condition for sacrificing submarines." The newspaper concludes, "The British government has always advocated the unconditional abolition of submarines, or at least reducing the tonnage of submarines so that their strength is only sufficient to protect the seaports of various countries." (Havas Telegram from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Daily Mail of the 31st carries an article by the famous military journalist 巴伏泰, stating that if the great powers agree to abolish aircraft carriers, Japan also intends to abolish all submarines. The Japanese naval authorities specially denied this and issued the following statement: The Japanese Empire advocated at the Geneva Disarmament Conference (1) that aircraft carriers are inherently offensive weapons, so they advocated complete abolition, which was supported by most countries; (2) that submarines are inherently defensive weapons, so they advocated that they are necessary for the national defense of naval countries with small forces, and opposed complete abolition, which was supported by most countries except for two or three countries. Therefore, the Japanese Empire's position has not changed to this day. (Dentsu Telegram from the 1st)</p>
<h3>Pacific Mandated Islands: Japan Submits Annual Report. Establishing Fortresses on Future Mandated Territories. League of Nations Discussions Did Not Involve This. Members Questioned the Reasons for the Decrease in Natives</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The most noteworthy issue at today's meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council was Japan's submission of its annual report to the League of Nations on its mandated territories in the Pacific. During the discussion of this report, there was no mention of future mandated territories or the construction of fortresses in ports. Participants questioned Japanese representative 伊藤 about the financial status of the islands, the method of establishing budgets, the economic system, import and export trade, education, public health, labor conditions, and freedom of religion. They paid particular attention to the decrease in the native population on the islands. 伊藤 replied that the decrease in the native population is common to all Pacific islands. Since 1850, there have been no less than 28 investigations into this matter, but the experts engaged in the investigation have not reached a consensus on the cause of the decrease and the remedial measures that should be taken.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has notified the British government of the US plan to raise domestic prices and stabilize the US dollar abroad, stating that it is friendly and purely a domestic matter arising from domestic circumstances. The President is now awaiting the British response so that the US actions in the European market will not provoke retaliatory plans and competition to suppress currency values. (Reuters Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The rumor that the United States and Britain will soon establish a monetary truce is now becoming more credible. According to reliable sources, the US President has submitted a practical plan for Anglo-American cooperation to Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the chief British negotiator on war debts. Its content advocates that the two countries work together to eliminate fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound. The US government is currently awaiting the British government's response before instructing the Federal Reserve to implement a plan to purchase gold abroad. However, it is reported that the United States now wants the US dollar to depreciate gradually so that domestic prices can gradually rise, while Britain is more concerned about avoiding sharp fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. (National Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Washington) People are eagerly awaiting the next steps in President Roosevelt's gold policy. According to well-informed sources, if the President's latest strategy to manipulate gold to raise prices fails, he will adopt a direct method of inflation to reach the limit allowed by Congress, which would allow the President to reduce the gold content of the US dollar by half, or he may adopt a composite currency system. It is also unknown. It is said that the authorities now want to know the UK's opinion on the President's gold purchase plan before starting to purchase abroad. Unreliable gold mine stocks are now appearing one after another, which is one of the results of the gold program being announced. The partisan truce that has existed since President Roosevelt took office has now ended, and the Republican National Committee has issued an article stating that President Roosevelt's promises during the election, such as a sound currency, an international monetary conference, a balanced budget, and a reduction in central government expenses, have all been broken. Five important industrialists on the Industry Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration have now resigned from their positions as members. According to their stated reason, it is to comply with the rotation service method. (Reuters Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Washington) As prominent economists across the country predict that the US President will take another major action in the currency field, the Republican National Committee has begun to attack President Roosevelt's inconsistency in words and deeds and his sole knowledge of allocating official positions to members of his own party. According to prominent economists, the President's decision to purchase gold at home and abroad has created a chaotic situation that must be clarified by another major measure, and it is believed that the gold purchase plan is the last resort before inflating banknotes. Even if the gold purchase still cannot raise prices, the agricultural community will demand the real inflation of banknotes on a large scale. Although, in their opinion, even if the value of the US dollar is reduced and a large number of banknotes are printed, it may not be able to significantly increase prices, and even if the value of the US dollar is reduced, the increase in prices will be temporary. People will soon lose their trust in the currency. Currently, there is little discussion about the gold purchase plan, causing national nervousness, and the stock market is therefore greatly affected by rumors. At present, regarding the gold purchase plan, only Jones, the general manager of the Financial Reconstruction Corporation, has issued a statement denying that the United States is attempting to manipulate the world's gold production, and denying that the company has purchased gold in foreign markets, nor has it decided when to start purchasing gold, but he expects it to be in the near future. In addition, the Wanhua Party National Committee has issued a pamphlet claiming that the US President's abandonment of the gold standard to control currency has violated the Democratic Party's platform, and that his previous monetary measures are also contrary to the assurances he gave to the people before taking office. After accepting the power granted by Congress to inflate the currency, he no longer maintains the party platform and his own published policies. It also said that the US President only knows how to allocate official positions to members of his own party in public works projects, and only 50,000 unemployed workers have actually found work. In addition, it attacked the US President for allowing cotton loans to China and Russia after declaring opposition to increasing foreign debt. (National Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<p>(London) London bankers still do not understand President Roosevelt's gold policy and admit that they cannot find the basis for a fixed gold price, believing that the gold price is determined arbitrarily. If President Roosevelt's policy wavers slightly, the result will be the opposite of what President Roosevelt hopes for, because it will encourage the transfer of the franc to the US dollar and increase the value of the US dollar. According to Reuters' New York telegram, Washington telegrams all say that the US authorities hope that Britain will adopt a neutral policy while the US assumes a modest and restrained action, the idea being that the US will only slightly purchase gold abroad in order to influence the US dollar, but does not want to hinder the world gold market. According to sources responsible in Washington, although this matter will be raised with London soon, it has not yet been put into practice. (Special Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<h3>The Franc's Position is Firm</h3>
<p>(Paris) Officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of France have made it clear that no matter how much cash US President Roosevelt purchases in the European market, the franc's firm position will not be affected. It is also said that the meaning of the US President's purchase of large amounts of cash has not yet been explained, so we cannot know its purpose. (Havas Telegram from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Mining Areas are Full of Vitality</h3>
<p>San Francisco According to a report from the Mining Exchange, regardless of the outcome of the US President's gold purchase plan, the gold mining areas in the western states have now become very prosperous. Mining areas that were deserted like death a few months ago have now regained their vitality and are once again showing a bustling scene. One gold mining center has seen its population increase rapidly since the initial proposal to allow newly mined gold to be exported, and has now more than doubled. At present, all companies are making considerable profits, and even small, little-known companies are experiencing a surge of speculation in their stocks. Reports from the mining areas of California and Nevada indicate that, at the current price of newly mined gold, even mining areas that previously had low gold production and were about to suffer losses can now be mined and be profitable. The government's recent decision to purchase newly mined gold at a higher price based on the foreign market price has given the gold mining industry a new stimulus.

<h3>US Congressmen Advocate Building New Naval Bases</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, it was heard that after some congressmen inspected the US naval bases and returned to the capital, they anticipated that there would be a major movement in the next Congress to increase the effectiveness of the navy and establish new bases on the Pacific coast at the western end of Panama. It is heard that they are particularly impressed by the need to establish naval bases at the western mouth of Panama and are now asking other congressmen to support this budget. If it fails to pass, they will ask the government to allocate funds from public works funds so that naval bases can be built in Balboa, with the same regulations as the base in Coco Solo. Naval officials have also requested that four docks be built in Balboa that can dock the largest warships. However, it is not known whether Navy Secretary Swanson supports this matter, as he has stated that he will build ships first and then build bases. It is also heard that naval officials have not yet estimated the funds required for this base, but the survey of each port has been completed, and the cost estimate should not be very difficult.

<h3>Japanese New Destroyer Launch Ceremony: Hull Did Not Move, Ceremony Stopped</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy's newly built First-Class Destroyer "Hatsushimo" (1,450 tons) has been completed. The launch ceremony was held at 3:00 PM on the 31st. After Commander Tomino of the Yokosuka Naval District named the ship, the chief of the Uraga shipyard, Imaoka, cut the ropes, but the hull did not move on the slipway, so the launch ceremony was declared stopped. There has never been a precedent for this kind of thing. The reason is a failure of the slipway. (Nichi-Nichi Allied Telegram from the 1st)</p>
<h3>Siberia: Soviet Military Preparations. Military Vehicles Head East in an Endless Stream. Rushing to Build Railways Extending into Outer Mongolia. Large Numbers of Aircraft Gather Near Chita</h3>
<p>A Harbin dispatch from the Tzu Lin Pao on the 21st states: Yesterday, an Englishman arrived in Harbin and claimed that the Soviet Union is currently making large-scale military preparations throughout Siberia. As he traveled from the Ural Mountains on the border between Europe and Asia to Chita, he saw trains loaded with military supplies heading east in an endless stream. Most of the military supplies were loaded on open-air platforms. Passengers on these platforms could often see huge freight cars, trailers, and tanks parked among them. Other platforms were piled with guns, cannons, and airplanes, all waiting to be loaded onto military vehicles. After passing Lake Baikal and Chita, large numbers of troops could be seen building barracks. Moreover, not only near the large stations, but also small stations had troops stationed, indicating that the entire area was gradually being filled by the continuous eastward movement of troops from western Russia. Several new railway lines could also be seen branching south from the Siberian Railway, still under construction. It is said that they will be extended into Outer Mongolia. Not far from Chita, countless aircraft could be seen parked in the open field, apparently just transported from central Russia. The warehouses and hangars have not yet been built, and a large aviation town is being built here, the scale of which is comparable to what can be seen near Irkutsk by train.</p>

However, the meeting on the Danube and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu's residence in Sofia and other visits are sufficient evidence of the enhancement of relations between Bulgaria and its neighbors.

<h3>Japanese Military Clique Seizes Puppet State Railways: Hishikari Visits President of South Manchuria Railway for Secret Talks. Kwantung Army Will Govern All Railways in Northeast</h3>
<p>(Dalian) Yesterday afternoon, Hishikari visited Count Hayashi, President of the South Manchuria Railway, and Vice President Hatta. The nature of the conversation is currently being kept secret, but because there are rumors outside that the South Manchuria Railway is being reorganized, the public is paying close attention to this meeting. It is heard that the reorganization plan for the South Manchuria Railway proposed by the Kwantung Army authorities is only intended to be implemented on the "Manchukuo" railways entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway for management, and not on the South Manchuria Railway itself. The contract for transferring the "Manchukuo" railways to the South Manchuria Railway will become legally binding by imperial order. This matter makes some changes to the South Manchuria Railway organization necessary. In the future, it is planned to formulate a concrete plan and submit it to the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of the Army for approval.

<h3>Russian Consul and Puppet Representative Argue Endlessly: Soviet Union Demands Release of Arrested Personnel</h3>
<p>(Harbin) "Manchukuo" recently arrested three Russians, including one soldier. The diplomatic representatives of both sides in Harbin have been arguing over this case, which has not yet been resolved. These three were arrested while fishing on an island in the Heilongjiang River, 40 miles from Aihun, and were escorted here by a "Manchukuo" gunboat. "Manchukuo" claims that the island is within its territory, while the Soviet Union claims that the island belongs to Russia. After the three were arrested, the Soviet Consul-General in Harbin, Shirovsky, protested to the Manchukuo diplomatic representative Shi Liben on October 6, demanding their release. Shi's reply blamed the Soviet Union for violating the sovereignty of "Manchukuo." Yesterday, Shi personally visited Shi, asking him to pay attention to the Soviet protest. Shi said that he laughed when he read the letter. Shi said that the matter was important and not a child's play, because the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 specifically stipulated that the island belonged to Manchuria. Shi also stated that Shi's protest was groundless and should be withdrawn, and demanded that the seven Russian soldiers and two civilians who escaped when the three were arrested be arrested and sent to "Manchukuo." Shi still demanded the release of the three, but Shi had to first recognize "Manchukuo's" sovereignty over the island. Shi also demanded the release of the Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway who were detained, and said that the White Russians employed by the "Manchukuo" police had mistreated the detained Russians. Shi said that the arrested Russian employees had committed criminal offenses and that he could not release them. At this point, Shi submitted a letter of protest to Shi, because ten Soviet cavalrymen near Manzhouli had crossed into Manchuria to take pictures, which violated the sovereignty of "Manchukuo."

<h3>Indo-Japanese Conference: India's New Proposal</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The final proposal submitted by India, according to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is as follows: (1) The maximum amount of cotton cloth imports is 400 million square yards (previous proposal was 370 million square yards). (2) The cotton cloth import volume will be based on 240 million square yards, and Japan will purchase 1.2 million bales of Indian cotton (the previous proposal was based on 320 million square yards, and the Indian cotton purchase volume was 1.25 million bales). (3) For every increase or decrease of 10,000 bales in the Indian cotton purchase volume, the cotton cloth import volume will increase or decrease by 2 million square yards. Compared with Japan's proposal of 500 million square yards of cotton cloth import and 1 million bales of Indian cotton purchase, this final proposal has a difference of 100 million square yards in cotton cloth import volume. According to India's base, to export 400 million square yards of cotton cloth, Japan must purchase 1.5 million bales of Indian cotton. (1st dispatch from Dentsu)</p>
<h3>Definition of Fascism: The Expression of Strength Aligns with Practical Work; Governing the Country According to Talent Emulates the Spirit of Ancient Rome</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Envoy newspaper reported that on the anniversary of the eleventh army of the Italian Fascist revolution, Prime Minister Mussolini issued a circular explaining the meaning of Fascism and the goals it seeks to achieve. It stated, "Fascism is the expression of strength. On the one hand, it is the poetry of literature and art; on the other hand, it is practical work. Fascism advocates selecting talents according to their individual abilities and allowing them to govern the country. This is a revival of the ideas of ancient Rome. Any nation that seeks prosperity through work clearly demonstrates its desire for peace, which need not be reiterated. The Italian people are trained in this way, so they are the most reliable element in maintaining order. What the world needs most now for general security and peace is nothing more than maintaining order." (31st dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Commerce Developing Towards Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Rome: A correspondent for the "Morning Post" stationed in the Egyptian capital inquired of the Foreign Minister of Abyssinia in Africa about the relationship between Abyssinia and Japan. The Abyssinian Foreign Minister, Serias, replied that the Japanese and Abyssinian governments had recently held talks with the aim of promoting trade between the two countries, which was not enough to threaten foreign business, at least not at present. Abyssinia has reduced tariffs on Japanese goods for three years. An Abyssinian cabinet member has been to Tokyo, and Japanese merchants have come to Abyssinia. The government has granted a tax-free zone of 1,400 hectares for them to grow cotton and has promised even greater concessions. The depreciation of the Japanese yen will enable Japanese trade in Abyssinia to develop further, as it has in other countries. In short, Abyssinia needs to be developed and is willing to cooperate with all countries, not just Japan. (1st dispatch from Havas)</p>

Because he himself was unwell, he would definitely not go at present. (2) Within a day or two, he would telegraph the Central Government, stating that the previous telegram opposing autonomy was because he did not understand the truth at the time, and that he would absolutely support autonomy in the future, and would issue a statement to the newspapers explaining the reasons for the change.

<h3>Organizational Law of the Border Affairs Department Pending Drafting: Bai Yunti Proposes Establishing a Political Affairs Hall</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Bai Yunti told reporters that although the central government has decided in principle to change the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission to the Border Affairs Department, the draft organizational law for the department has not yet been drafted. After Minister Huang returns to Beijing from Mongolia, he will be responsible for drafting it in accordance with the established principles of the central government and with reference to various opinions. It will be submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the Central Political Council for review, before being submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, before it can be finalized. In recent years, the authorities of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission have occasionally been inadequate in handling Mongolian and Tibetan issues, and the greatest drawback has been that the Mongolian and Tibetan princes have had little contact with the central government, resulting in emotional separation, which has allowed foreigners to take advantage of the situation and incite them, which has greatly harmed the country's future. In order to correct this shortcoming, Mongolian and Tibetan princes, as well as people of prestige from Mongolia and Tibet, should have more contact with the central government. Therefore, before Minister Huang left Beijing, I presented this idea to the central government and consulted with Minister Huang several times, proposing to establish a Political Affairs Hall under the organizational system of the Border Affairs Department, stipulating appropriate measures to enable Mongolian and Tibetan princes and various ethnic groups to be influenced by Party ideology. In the future, when they return to Mongolia and handle local administration, lower-level situations can be reported to higher levels, and the feelings of the border areas will gradually become harmonious, which will have immeasurable effects. After Minister Huang returns to Beijing, I will consult with him once more and then draft a written opinion to submit to the central government as a reference for drafting the organizational law of the Border Affairs Department. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The reorganization of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission into the Border Affairs Department has been accompanied by Minister Huang Shaoxiong and Vice Chairman Zhao Pilian to Mongolia to seek the consent of all parties, so it will not be implemented until Huang and Zhao return to Beijing. Chairman of the Commission, Shi Qingyang, has previously requested to resign from the Executive Yuan due to feeling unwell from time to time. Whether or not it will be approved is undecided. However, there are two candidates for the future Minister, the Panchen Lama and Yan Xishan. However, the Panchen Lama is indeed familiar with the Mongolian side, but he has not had sufficient contact with the Dalai Lama in Tibet, so it is unlikely to become a reality. Therefore, Yan Xishan is more hopeful. (1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Bai Yunti advocated establishing a national defense zone in Inner Mongolia and reorganizing the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission into a Political Affairs Hall, with the leaders of each league and the princes as members. The central government should also send troops led by high-ranking officers to station there, which can consolidate the border defense and strengthen the connection between Mongolia and the central government.

<h3>Construction Committee Plans to Build Huainan Coal Mine Railway: First Build the Section from the Mine to Hefei; Teams to Conduct Surveys Within the Month</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Construction Committee plans to build the Huainan Coal Mine Railway and is scheduled to conduct surveys next month. It will first raise funds to build the section from the mine to Hefei and plans to build a large power plant in Luohe Town. The Huainan Coal Mine (located at Jiulonggang, 18 li from Luohe Town, Huai County, northern Anhui, in the lower reaches of the Huai River) has abundant reserves, estimated at 24 million tons, and can be mined for 100 years. It is the only large coal mine producing area in northern Anhui. Two wells, east and west, have already been opened, each with a depth of more than 100 meters, producing 600 tons of bituminous coal per day. In addition to supplying the Construction Committee's power plants, it is also transported and sold to the Huai River basin and the Yangtze River basin, from Anqing to Shanghai. It is planned to build a light railway from the mine southwards, passing through Fengtai, Shouxian, Hefei, Chaoxian, and other places, directly reaching Wuhu on the Yangtze River. The entire line is more than 300 li long and requires more than 10 million yuan. A survey was conducted once, but it was suspended due to the large amount of money required. It has now been decided to first build the area from the mine to Hefei, and a survey team will be dispatched within the month to carry out the survey. In the future, when the railway is built, transportation will be convenient, and it is also planned to build a large coal well with a depth of 300 meters, so that it can increase by 1,000 tons per day. In addition, a large power plant will be built in Luohe using coal from the mine to supply the needs of counties and towns within a hundred li. The required expenses are planned to be guaranteed by the mineral products and jointly operated by soliciting commercial shares. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Heavy Losses in the Postal Service: Total Losses Last Year Reached More Than 5 Million Yuan</h3>

However, the various expenses totaled more than 38 million yuan, resulting in a loss of more than 5 million yuan. The reasons for the loss are: (1) Dong Province could have a surplus of 2 million yuan per year, but after the suspension of operations, all of it was lost, and the salaries of the employees entering the customs still had to be paid as usual. (2) Affected by floods, bandit disasters, and wars. (3) The devaluation of copper coins in the new Yunnan and Sichuan provinces caused the postal revenue to suffer losses. (4) The South Seas postal charges bureau suffered considerable losses. In 1921, more than 83.7 million pieces of mail were received and sent, an increase of 40 million pieces compared with the previous year. Only more than 6 million parcels were received and sent, with a value of about 13 million yuan, which was much lower than the previous year. The postal mileage decreased slightly by 8,522 li compared with the previous year. The number of bureaus decreased by a total of 312, not including the agency post offices and mailboxes. This year's airmail transport reached more than 3 million pieces, and only more than 100 parcels.

However, recently, Liu Cunhou's troops disobeyed military orders and abandoned Suiding. This was due to fear of the bandits, cowardice in battle, and a desire to preserve their strength. As a result, Liu Cunhou was dismissed from his post and investigated. His troops were handed over to Liu Bangjun for reorganization. On the 26th, Liu Xiang was ordered to reiterate the telegram orders to the Sichuan army, requiring strict compliance. The telegram stated: "Chengdu, Commander-in-Chief Liu Fucheng, Confidential, All troops in Sichuan involved in bandit suppression, whether stationed or advancing, must strictly follow orders and cooperate in their actions, proceeding in unison. They must not lightly abandon their defense areas, advance or retreat without authorization, or sit idly by and watch the outcome without providing effective support. Military officers were strictly instructed and agreed to abide by these rules in a telegram earlier this month, with severe penalties for violations. However, this time, Liu Cunhou, the commander of the 23rd Army, defended Suiding with the strength of an entire army. The city was abandoned immediately upon hearing of the bandit's approach. The rapid collapse within a day was due to ineffective defense and a dereliction of duty. The crime of disobeying orders cannot be excused. Liu Cunhou should be immediately dismissed and investigated to serve as a warning. The remaining troops should be taken over and reorganized by Liu Bangjun, the deputy commander of the army, who will be responsible for making efforts to achieve success. All other troops involved in bandit suppression are expected to reiterate the previous order in the telegram, urging strict compliance. If there are any violations, the central government will impose penalties and will not be lenient. It must be understood that without strict rewards and punishments, it will be impossible to encourage the military and reverse the decline. In addition to reporting to the central government, you are expected to forward this order to all armies for uniform compliance." (October 31st)</p>
<h3>Liaonan: Records of the Volunteer Army's Actions - Battle Situation from June to August - Reorganization of the Army in the Thousand Mountains Due to the Retreat of the Green Curtain</h3>
<p>Shenyang Communication: After General Commander Qi Zhanjiu of the Liaonan National Salvation Army returned from inside the pass this spring, he thoroughly reorganized his troops, selected elites, and formed them into four brigades, totaling about 16,000 people. The firearms are still relatively complete. When the green curtain rose this summer, they attacked the Japanese army, using guerrilla warfare tactics, and often achieved victories, making the Japanese army exhausted. The recent activities of the army are detailed below: (1) At 2:00 PM on June 3rd, the First Brigade, led by Liu Yisan, engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese Third Squadron Guard in Toudaolongwan, Liaozhong County, for four hours, killing more than 80 Japanese soldiers. Japanese officer Lieutenant Commander Kobato of the Gendarmerie was also killed in action. They captured a mountain gun, a machine gun, nine Selbstlader pistols, two 8mm Nambu pistols, more than 20 rifles, two boxes of ammunition, and five war horses. The army suffered more than 30 casualties.</p>
<p>(2) On June 13th, the Second Brigade, led by Wang Huimin, and the Fourth Brigade, led by Cui Deyin, engaged in a fierce battle with a Japanese infantry battalion, a mortar team, a gendarmerie guard squadron, and Yu Zhishan's puppet army cavalry regiment, totaling more than 6,000 people, in Xinkaihe, Tai'an County, for three days and nights. The army was surrounded on all sides, and the situation was very critical. Until the night of the 16th, Xie Shoukun of the special service battalion ordered cavalry to attack the enemy's rear, cutting off their communication. An attack from both inside and outside led to the lifting of the siege. The enemy army abandoned their weapons and fled. The army pursued them for six miles. At dawn, the Japanese army brought in reinforcements in automobiles, and one squadron was also annihilated by the army. In this battle, the army captured five new-style machine guns, four mortars, more than 280 rifles, more than 40 pistols, and more than 20 boxes of ammunition. More than 200 puppet army soldiers and more than 150 Japanese soldiers were killed, including one major instructor and two lieutenant squadron officers. The army suffered more than 300 casualties. This battle was the most intense since the Liaonan National Salvation Army began its operations.</p>
<p>(3) On June 25th, the Third Brigade, led by Wang Haoqiang, attacked Gaochazi Town and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army for a day and a night. They recaptured the town that night. At 9:00 AM on the 26th, three Japanese airplanes bombed the town. The army, unwilling to poison the townspeople, abandoned the town.</p>
<p>(4) At 4:00 PM on July 1st, the Fourth Brigade, led by Cui Deyin, attacked Quanpao (town name) in Liaoxi and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army until 8:00 PM. The Japanese army sent reinforcements of the 14th Regiment from Dashiqiao, and Wang Zhanzhong's puppet army sent two battalions of infantry from Yingkou to reinforce them. They fought fiercely until dawn, engaging in hand-to-hand combat five or six times, and finally repelled the Japanese and puppet army. In this battle, more than 50 Japanese soldiers and more than 130 puppet army soldiers were killed. They captured three mountain guns, a machine gun, four pistols, more than 70 rifles, six boxes of ammunition, and 15 war horses. The army suffered more than 90 casualties.</p>
<p>(5) At 2:00 PM on July 15th, the First Brigade and the Special Service Battalion attacked Yingkou Station, destroying a locomotive and more than a dozen train cars, and killing the Japanese stationmaster, Xiaoteng. Conductors, train staff, and train drivers were all killed. Then, the Japanese garrison and Wang Zhanzhong's puppet army led their teams to reinforce them. After a fierce battle until 9:00 PM, the army retreated to the Thousand Mountains for strategic reasons. In this battle, no less than a hundred enemies were killed, and more than 20 rifles and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were captured. The army suffered more than 10 casualties.</p>
<p>(6) On August 4th, because the people were harvesting autumn crops, which was inconvenient for operations, the army all retreated to the Thousand Mountains to carry out replenishment and reorganization, strengthen their strength, and make another move to recover lost territory. (Dongbei She)</p>

<h3>Relaxing the Measures for Changqiao Street</h3>
<p>Changqiao South Street is a bustling marketplace. Since the opening of the Songwei Road and the movie theaters, the flow of merchants has become increasingly lively. However, the streets are narrow, making traffic very inconvenient. County Magistrate Jin has sent a technical director to conduct on-site measurements and determine the required widening. A resolution has been reached on the matter. Today, the county government meeting discussed the measures for widening Changqiao Street first. The fundraising and demolition of buildings on both sides are all tightly linked and cannot be resolved in a short period. Therefore, it was decided to appoint five groups, including the county party headquarters, the Public Security Bureau, the District Office, the Property Management Office, and the County Chamber of Commerce, to discuss the methods and then re-examine them.</p>
<h3>Pre-Announcement of Zhang Huaixi's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Encircling and Suppressing Bandits in Dian Shan Lake</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 1st), Shen, the District Chief of the Third District of Water Public Security, reported that more than 40 bandits from Hunan Province suddenly appeared in the Dian Shan Lake area bordering Tai Lake. They were on three boats, fully armed, and planned to rob villages. Nearby residents were extremely panicked. After receiving the report, District Chief Shen immediately telegraphed the 11th, 12th, and 14th teams to dispatch patrol boats and set out to encircle and suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<h3>Robbery and Kidnapping by Bandits</h3>
<p>There have been frequent robberies in Zhangpu Township from Shanghai, and the people cannot sleep peacefully. At 8:00 PM on the 31st of last month, in Tiandu Village, four miles away from Zhangpu Town, two bandit boats suddenly arrived. More than a dozen bandits, each carrying firearms, went ashore and robbed Li Zengyao's house. When Zengjia Sha Village, a neighboring village, heard the alarm, they beat drums and gathered dozens of people to capture them. The bandits opened fire, killing Zhou Ruilin and Zhou Arong. Everyone dispersed, and the bandits kidnapped Li Zengyao's son, Xingyuan, and calmly fled towards Shuangyangtan, Hunan. Afterwards, County Magistrate Cheng Ruji and Public Security Bureau Chief Hua Shijun learned about the incident and immediately ordered police captain Luo Qixiang and inspectors Wang Shouren and Wang Yunshan to lead armed detectives on the Kun Jing Lun to arrest them. The bandits had already gone far away.</p>
<h3>Trial Officer Transferred</h3>
<p>Chen Ying, the judicial trial officer of Kunshan County Government, has been in office for three years. He has now been ordered by the High Court to be transferred to Jiading County to replace Zhang Yizhi, the judicial trial officer there. Officer Chen is rushing to complete the handover. County Magistrate Cheng Ruji is now submitting a request to the High Court to retain him. It is not known whether it will be approved.</p>

<h3>Murder Case for Property Solved</h3>
<p>Zhu Guiqing, a farmer from Xumiao Zhujiazhai Village in the Northeast Township, went outside to defecate alone at 11:00 PM on the 27th. Suddenly, thugs ambushed him beside the house and stabbed him more than a dozen times in the neck and abdomen with sharp blades. Zhu cried for help only twice before his trachea was cut and he fell to the ground. His family members heard the noise and were shocked. They saw the murderer had fled, and Zhu was lying stiff in a pool of blood, unable to speak. He soon died. Zhu's younger brother, Guixiang, reported the incident to the Fifth District Office, which forwarded it to the county government. Officer Zhang led officials to verify that Zhu had been killed during his lifetime and ordered an investigation. At the beginning of the incident, there were rumors that Zhu was 62 years old, from a well-to-do family, with one wife and two concubines, and only one daughter. He was extremely stingy, and many members of the Zhu clan coveted his property. His assassination was inevitably related to the clan, etc. After Zhu's body was verified, coffined, and a funeral was held, Zhu Huaibang, a member of the Zhu clan from the Zhu ancestral hall in Liuhe South, and his son, Lv, went to offer condolences. Someone noticed that their clothes had blood stains. It was discovered that the murderer was among the mourners. The county government was informed and sent police to arrest and interrogate Huaibang and his son.</p>

<h3>Urgent Progress on Rebuilding the New Prison</h3>
<p>The issue of rebuilding the new prison in the county has been talked about for a long time, but progress has been difficult due to financial constraints. According to the planned budget, a total of 60,000 yuan is needed. The site for rebuilding the new prison will be based on the existing entire prison site and must be expanded. The dilapidated houses behind the court and the drill ground of the water police district will be included and rebuilt. Its capacity will be limited to 600 people. The style will be modeled after the third prison in Suzhou. A medical room and bathroom will also be gradually equipped in the prison. Yesterday, the Wuxi Prison Promotion Association held its eighth meeting on this issue. County Magistrate Yan presided over the meeting. First, the chairman reported that the estimated cost of rebuilding the new prison was approximately 60,000 yuan. Except for the High Court's grant of 10,000 yuan, there was still a large shortfall. Therefore, it was proposed to reduce the cost through engineering methods to achieve a balance. The project has now been replanned and redrawn, reducing the total project cost to 40,000 yuan. How to raise this fund should be decided by the public. After discussion, it was decided to use 40,000 yuan as the standard. In addition to the 10,000 yuan already allocated by the High Court, a request will be submitted to continue allocating 10,000 yuan. The remaining funds will be raised locally as much as possible. If there is still a shortfall, the Catholic Association will be asked to subsidize it. In addition, Zhou Jimei, a Catholic in the county, went to Shanghai yesterday to visit Lu Bohong to build a teaching hall and a civilian hospital for the detention center, so that construction could begin at the same time as rebuilding the new prison. It is said that the estimated cost of the teaching hall is 650 yuan, of which Rong Desheng has generously donated 200 yuan, and the rest will be recognized and donated by the Catholic Association.</p>

<h3>Malignant Malaria Prevalent in Jurong</h3>
<p>Malignant malaria occurred in the area of more than 20 miles near Dongchang Street in the Second District of Jurong County last month. About 6,000 to 7,000 people were infected, and about 100 people died, especially children. Because the local atmosphere is closed and people regard it as a matter of fate, they do not know how to seek treatment. Therefore, very few people outside know about it. Later, as the number of deaths increased, the provincial hospital in the town also heard about it, so it sent doctors and midwifery students from the hospital to organize a temporary clinic team to go to the countryside every day to provide treatment. At the same time, it reported the epidemic situation in the area to the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs. Department Director Gu reported to the provincial government to allocate medical expenses to treat poor people. After deliberation, the provincial government decided to allocate 2,000 yuan for medical expenses to the provincial hospital for active treatment. On the 18th of this month, Department Director Gu went to inspect the area to understand the epidemic situation. The inspection report is summarized as follows: (1) Epidemic situation: Dongchang Street is about 20 miles away from Jurong and is under the jurisdiction of the Second District of the county. According to interviews with local village chiefs, district leaders, and the public, this type of malaria was most prevalent in September. The area accounts for about half of the entire district. In villages near Dongchang Street, such as Yuan Village, Nanshan Village, Dongjing Village, Tuxiang Village, and Qiaodong Village, about 70% of the residents suffer from malaria, and about 2% to 3% of patients die, mostly children around the age of ten. Very few strong people die. In total, there are about 6,000 to 7,000 people in the two districts, and about 100 people have died. Now, due to the cold weather, the disease has greatly decreased. Since the outbreak of the epidemic, Yan Xijiu, the county magistrate of Jurong, visited Dongchang Street once on October 24th and ordered the county hospital preparation office to set up a clinic in Jiancang Village, assigning doctors Meng Jikang and two assistants to be responsible for outpatient and home visits. Each group can treat more than 150 patients. The provincial hospital also sent four temporary clinic teams a week ago to go to the countryside by car every day to provide treatment, which can treat more than 400 patients. A total of more than 3,000 pills are needed, worth more than 70 yuan. If treatment continues for three weeks, malaria can be completely eliminated.</p>
<h3>Department Director Zhou Inspects Jiangbei</h3>
<p>Zhou Fohai, the director of the Education Department of Jiangsu, attaches great importance to education in various counties. He previously went to various districts in Jiangnan for on-site inspections. It is now heard that Zhou is eager to understand the education situation in various districts in Jiangbei and has specifically scheduled to take a boat north from Zhenjiang with important officials today (the 1st), going directly to Huaiyin. After a brief stay, he will transfer to other counties. The date of return to the province is approximately mid-month.</p>

<h3>Housewife in Hantang Township Robbery Case Tragically Burned to Death</h3>
<p>Ge Caihong, a resident of Hantang Township in the Seventh District of the county, is nearly 60 years old and has more than 200 mu of land. He has long been coveted by villains. Several years ago, he was robbed once. At that time, Ge had two sons who were strong and powerful, and they fought with the thieves, causing the thieves to be injured and failing to achieve their goals. This year, both sons died one after another. There are only his wife, daughter, widowed daughter-in-law, and orphaned grandson in the family. On the 28th of this month, at the beginning of the evening, more than a dozen bandits suddenly broke into the house. Fortunately, the widowed daughter-in-law returned to Ning and the young grandson followed her, causing the rice to be tied up. Ge's daughter heard the alarm and escaped over the wall. Ge's wife was unable to escape. The thieves ordered her to hand over money, but she refused, so she was tied up and whipped, and her skin and flesh were burned with fire. Her cries reached outside the house. The group of thieves then overturned boxes and cabinets, robbing clothes and cash worth about a thousand yuan. Later, neighbors heard the noise and rushed over, but the thieves had already fled far away. Ge's wife died shortly after, a truly tragic event.</p>

<h3>Farmer Murdered While Walking at Night</h3>
<p>Langshi Town in the Fourth District of Huaiyin has always been plagued by bandits. Zhang Da, a farmer, went out for a leisurely walk after dinner the day before yesterday and did not return all night. His father, Qiyuan, was deeply surprised. He waited until dawn and sent people to search everywhere. As a result, Da's body was found in a field half a mile away from his home. There were several gunshot wounds, and his head had been eaten by dogs and was unrecognizable. However, the clothes and shoes he was wearing could still prove who was killed. It was difficult to determine the truth for a while. Village Chief Zhao Liping reported the incident to the Fourth District Office and the garrison camp. District Chief Wang, Camp Commander Dai, and others arrested four suspects, including Zuo Mingsheng, and presented them to the General Headquarters of the First Route Army. The county government was ordered to interrogate them.</p>

<h3>Supervisory Office Sends Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate County Magistrate's Case</h3>
<p>Zhou Heng, the magistrate of this county, is from Yixing. He has only been in Changshu for nearly half a year and has been repeatedly accused by citizens. Recently, Qian Huasheng and Hu Du, residents of Fanjia City outside the East Gate, accused Zhou Heng of corruption and bending the law and smoking opium to the provincial government. The Provincial Government has ordered the Third Administrative Supervisory Office to thoroughly investigate. Commissioner Zou sent personnel from the office, including Hua Chu, to Changshu secretly on the 31st. Hua, using the alias Li Bao, stayed at the Shouqian New Hotel. He immediately went to the plaintiff's home for interviews and also went to the Public Security Bureau and other places to investigate. It is reported that the plaintiffs have explained the facts, and Commissioner Hua has made progress.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Carries Out Combined Water and Land Transportation</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is undertaking the combined water and land transportation across the country. Since the implementation period is only two weeks away, it has been actively preparing and is very busy recently. The recent situation is described below:</p>
<h3>Appointment of Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>Of the eleven joint transportation lines across the country, the Longhai Railway is the most important, as it handles the most goods to and from the Northwest. This line has huge business potential. Currently, all staff at the Dapugang dock and warehouse have moved to Laoyao. Ferry services must start by the 15th of this month. The Hai Zhou branch bureau chief has a heavy responsibility. The original bureau chief, Shen Youzhi, has resigned to the Shanghai bureau, which Liu Hongsheng approved. The new Hai Zhou bureau chief at Laoyao has been carefully selected by General Manager Liu, and the capable and experienced Chen Youjie will fill the position. The appointment letter is expected to be issued within a day or two. After the announcement, Mr. Chen will immediately take office to handle Northwest joint transportation affairs.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Sends Personnel</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has specially established a Joint Transportation Division, hiring Dr. Zhou Fengtu, who holds a doctorate in economics from the United States, as the division chief. He has already assumed his duties at the bureau. However, Mr. Wu Delin of the Business Department has been the most hardworking and meritorious in the planning, investigation, negotiation, and surveying of these railway joint transportation matters. The Longhai Railway views this joint transportation as crucial to developing the Northwest's production industries. Therefore, the bureau has specially dispatched eight commissioners to Shanghai to reside within the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and join the Joint Transportation Division to assist in handling transportation matters. Two additional personnel have been assigned to manage the loading and unloading of goods onto barges in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Low Freight Rates</h3>
<p>For this Longhai Railway water-land joint transportation, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with the intention of facilitating merchants and providing preferential treatment, has agreed with the railway bureau on the lowest possible freight rates for all incoming and outgoing goods. Generally, the freight cost for goods destined for Zhengzhou, Lanfeng, and Diguan will be less than five yuan per ton, which is lower than ordinary civilian freight services, and the storage fees are also included. To further benefit merchants, all goods arriving from the Longhai Railway will be unloaded at Puxi docks, avoiding the hassle of transshipment. Customs clearance for incoming and outgoing cargo has also been agreed to be handled directly by bureau personnel, without using customs brokers.</p>
<h3>Contract Negotiations with Various Railways</h3>
<p>The contract for this joint transportation managed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was signed by the Ministry of Railways with the company. Each railway bureau will separately negotiate with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to establish detailed rules for joint transportation operations. The first to sign was the Longhai Railway, represented by Section Chief Zhou Songnian. Other railways, such as the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, Beijing-Hankou Railway, Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and Beijing-Shenyang Railway, are also negotiating detailed joint transportation rules with the company. These detailed rules are currently being negotiated separately and must adhere to the general contract and be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval to be valid. According to Mr. He Molin, head of the Business Department, the detailed rules for each railway have not yet been finalized and are currently being negotiated separately.</p>
<h3>Increased Vessel Rentals</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company anticipates a surge in cargo volume after the implementation of joint transportation, and its existing vessel tonnage is insufficient. It has already begun renting commercial vessels. According to officials from the company, the company will only rent Chinese-flagged vessels to increase cargo capacity and has already chartered the Kunxing, owned by Zhaoxing. This vessel will also be dispatched to Haizhou. They also stated that negotiations are underway for three vessels from a certain shipping company and will soon be accepted by the company. Therefore, even if there is a backlog of goods from the Northwest, the company is prepared to have six ships, which should be sufficient to meet demand.</p>

For example, cargo from Zhakou, Hangzhou, destined for various joint transportation stations on the Longhai Railway is loaded onto Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway freight cars in Zhakou, Hangzhou, and transported to Shanghai. At Maigen Road Station, the cars containing joint transportation cargo are unloaded and attached to the Shanghai-Beijing freight train. At Xuzhou Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway (where the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways connect), the joint transportation cargo cars are unloaded again and transferred to the designated joint transportation cars on the Longhai Railway. The procedure is the same for other joint transportation railways, whether going up or down the line. However, according to Article 29 of the provisional regulations, empty joint transportation cars from railways participating in joint transportation shall be returned to the original railway. Joint transportation cars shall have a white triangular mark printed on the car body by the originating railway for easy identification. The car number plates shall indicate the railways through which the car passes and a red "Joint" character for identification.</p>
<h3>Protection of Traffic</h3>
<p>After the Ministry ordered the implementation of Shanghai-Beijing direct joint transportation freight trains 401 and 402 on October 28, trains began operating from Shanghai as train 402 and from Beijing as train 401. However, due to unemployed dockworkers at Pukou Wharf on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway demanding relief and preventing the passage of direct Shanghai-Beijing freight trains, operations were temporarily suspended. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations received a telegram from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway stating that the Ministry of Railways and the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau had sent personnel to persuade the workers and dispatched a large contingent of armed soldiers to guard Pubei Wharf and Nanjing Wharf to protect traffic and suppress the workers. Freight car traffic resumed in the afternoon. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned the following details from various parties regarding the handling of the dockworker situation: (1) There are approximately 1,000 dockworkers and 2,000 casual laborers, totaling about 3,000, at Pukou Wharf on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. After preventing traffic, they were persuaded by the Ministry of Railways, the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration, who promised to properly handle the situation in the near future, with resettlement as the principle. However, the workers demanded an immediate response. (3) There are over 500 dockworkers at Nanjing Wharf on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. After being persuaded by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Traffic Department, the workers agreed to a two-part solution: (A) Resettlement as dockworkers at various stations on the two railways. (B) Issuance of travel expenses for dismissal.</p>
<h3>Traffic Schedule</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway received a telegram from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway stating that after the restoration of traffic on the Capital Railway Ferry, the Traffic Department was notified to resume direct Shanghai-Beijing joint transportation freight train service. Train 402, the direct Shanghai-Beijing freight train, departed from Shanghai's Maigen Road Station at 5:20 PM yesterday, scheduled to arrive at Nanjing Wharf at 6:40 AM today, board the ferry across the Yangtze River, depart from Pukou on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway at 3:20 PM this afternoon, arrive in Tianjin at 11:45 AM tomorrow, depart from Tianjin on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway at 6:30 PM, and arrive at Qianmen, Beijing, at 12:12 PM the day after tomorrow. Train 401, the direct Shanghai-Beijing freight train that was blocked in Pukou on October 30, finally boarded the ferry across the Yangtze River last night and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. It is reported that Beijing has again dispatched train 401, the Shanghai-Beijing freight train, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai in four days. From now on, there will be one train departing daily in each direction between Shanghai and Beijing.</p>
<h3>Handling Process</h3>
<p>National railway responsible freight joint transportation has been officially implemented yesterday after preparations. The handling process of the responsible freight joint transportation by the Director-General and Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, Huang Boqiao and Wu Shaozeng, are recorded as follows: "Last year, our national railways, following the orders and guidance of the Ministry of Railways, implemented responsible freight transportation, with the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Tianjin-Pukou Railways leading the way in handling responsible freight</p>

<p>joint transportation. This is a memorable page in the history of railway freight transportation. Starting from November 1st of this year, all railways nationwide were ordered to implement responsible freight joint transportation, marking a total mobilization of responsible railway freight transportation, which is especially commendable. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways began implementing responsible freight transportation on September 1, 1932, starting with eight stations and gradually increasing to 25 stations. They also transitioned from handling only full carload responsible transportation to handling less-than-carload responsible transportation. From October 1, all stations on both railways handled responsible transportation for both full carload and less-than-carload freight, marking the evolution of responsible freight transportation on these two railways. The Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Tianjin-Pukou Railways began implementing responsible freight joint transportation on October 1, 1932. The progression can be described as follows: (1) From October 1, 1932: (A) The following stations handled responsible freight joint transportation: Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways: Originating stations: all stations on the entire line (except Nanjing Wharf Station). Destination stations: all stations on the entire line (except Nanjing Wharf Station). Tianjin-Pukou Railway: Originating stations: all stations between Puzhen and Xuzhou, and north of Xuzhou, between Lincheng, Zaozhuang, and Jinan (except Xinzhuang and Dahuaishu Stations). Destination stations: all stations between Puzhen and Xuzhou. (B) The following types of cargo were handled under responsible joint transportation: Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways: sugar, cotton yarn, cigarettes, flour, paper, grain, liquor, and seven other types. Tianjin-Pukou Railway: all types of goods sold at Xuzhou and stations south of Xuzhou (except Pukou Station), and peanuts, peanuts in shells, black dates, and cotton north of Xuzhou. (C) Limited to full carloads. (3) From November 1, 1932: (A) All stations on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway handled originating and destination responsible freight joint transportation (except Pukou Station). (B) The types of responsible joint transportation cargo on the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Tianjin-Pukou Railways were not restricted. (C) Still limited to full carloads. (3) From November 15, 1932, the railways began implementing collect-on-delivery joint transportation on the responsible freight joint transportation lines (however, due to incomplete bilateral procedures, this was changed to May 1, 1933). (4) From December 1, 1932: (A) All stations on the responsible freight joint transportation lines (except Nanjing Wharf Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and Pukou Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway) handled less-than-carload responsible joint transportation, with no restrictions on the types of goods. (B) Shippers were allowed to change the consignment. (C) The Tianjin-Pukou Railway designated six stations—Tianjin, Jinan, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Linhuaiguan, and Mingguang—to initially issue bills of lading to stations on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. (5) From January 1, 1933, all joint transportation stations on the joint transportation lines issued and accepted bills of lading. On July 1 of this year, responsible freight joint transportation was also initiated with the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. The Ministry of Railways, recognizing that various railways nationwide had separately implemented responsible freight transportation and that the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, and Tianjin-Pukou Railways had achieved effective results in handling responsible freight joint transportation, decided to take a further step by ordering all railways nationwide to uniformly handle responsible freight joint transportation. The Ministry of Railways used the 35 articles of the provisional regulations for responsible freight transportation of the three railways as a blueprint, drafted the provisional regulations for responsible freight joint transportation, convened the 16th National Domestic Joint Transportation Conference in September 1933, meticulously discussed and revised them, resulting in 42 articles, which were promulgated by the Ministry and scheduled to be implemented on November 1. The number of joint transportation stations on each railway is as follows: Beijing-Shenyang Railway: 11 stations; Beijing-Hankou Railway: 10 stations; Longhai Railway: 5 stations; Jiaoji Railway: 2 stations; Beijing-Suiyuan Railway: 8 stations; Shanghai-Nanjing Railway: 10 stations; Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway: 8 stations; Daqing Railway: 10 stations; Zhengtai Railway: 4 stations; Tianjin-Pukou Railway: all stations except Jinan to Jiaoji, Xuzhou to Longhai, Tianjin Main Station to Beijing-Shenyang, and Xiaguan to Shanghai-Nanjing. In addition, it was stipulated that responsible joint transportation would be handled for all cargo, regardless of whether it was full carload or less-than-carload, and regardless of type or category, eliminating the previous geographical and category restrictions. This can be described as a thorough implementation of responsible freight joint transportation, which will undoubtedly increase convenience for merchants and promote the development of railway freight transportation. Regarding joint transportation freight rates, previously, the responsible transportation rates of each railway were combined for calculation. For example, for a full carload of fourth-class goods weighing 40 tons transported from Tianjin Main Station to Zhakou, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway charged 669.6 yuan, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway charged 99.6 yuan, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway charged 71.2 yuan, totaling 840.4 yuan. Now, the 16th National Domestic Joint Transportation Conference has resolved to adopt a decreasing-rate-with-distance system. Except for special joint transportation cargo or those enjoying reduced transportation benefits under specific regulations, for distances between 501 kilometers and 600 kilometers, 100% of the established rate will be charged. For every 100 kilometers beyond that, the rate will be reduced by 1%, up to a maximum reduction of 20%. In the example above, transporting cargo from Tianjin to Zhakou, with a distance of over 1,501 kilometers, should receive an 11% reduction in the established rate, making the total cost 747.956 yuan (rounding the final digit to the nearest 0.05 yuan, as per regulations; the original number is retained here for calculation accuracy). The Tianjin-Pukou Railway would charge approximately 595.944 yuan, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway would charge approximately 88.644 yuan, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway would charge approximately 63.368 yuan. This method is sufficient to encourage long-distance freight transportation, not only reducing the burden on merchants but also promoting the cooperation of "production," "transportation," and "sales," which also has profound significance. Furthermore, the railway traffic between the provinces north and south of the Yellow River and the coastal southeastern provinces is centered around Pukou and Xiaguan. However, the Yangtze River hinders this traffic in various ways. Recently, the completion of the Capital Railway Ferry, which allows vehicles to directly cross the river, has a far greater impact on freight transportation than on passenger transportation. Reducing the handling procedures reduces the chances of errors and damage. From the perspective of convenience, economy, and safety, the current situation is vastly different from the past. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the beginning of a new era in China's railway freight transportation. In summary, after the implementation of nationwide responsible freight joint transportation by all railways on November 1, 1933, the scope has expanded compared to the past, the rates have decreased, the operations have become more convenient, and the responsibilities of the personnel handling this joint transportation have also increased. If a loss occurs during responsible freight transportation on one railway, the full responsibility lies with that railway, making it easier to investigate and compensate, with a smaller impact. Now that all railways nationwide are uniformly handling responsible joint transportation, with vehicles traveling back and forth on various lines, if cargo is damaged or lost, it is difficult to determine who is responsible. Delays in handling this situation will inevitably lead to criticism from merchants and public opinion, which would have a significant impact on the reputation and business of the railways and cannot be ignored. Therefore, in addition to our joy, we cannot help but hope that our colleagues in the vehicle department and related departments of both railways will be especially cautious in handling all procedures related to responsible freight joint transportation in the future, ensuring clarity in handovers and meticulous supervision. If, unfortunately, errors still occur, we must use the most responsible and rapid methods to investigate the truth and take the fairest and most satisfying actions for the merchants. If we are careless, it will not only lead to compensation but also hinder the progress of the entire freight transportation system."</p>
<h3>Heroine Yao Ruifang Fights Against Japanese Aggression in Bloodshed</h3>
<p>Fuxing News Agency reports that since the September 18th Incident, Chinese people have been indignant at the Japanese invaders and have risen up to fight the enemy outside the Great Wall. In the freezing weather, there have been many unsung heroes. A reporter from the Fuxing News Agency recently learned about the heroine Yao Ruifang, the niece of Shanghai gentleman Yao Zirang and the sister of lawyer Yao Zhaoli, who is currently fighting the Japanese in the border region. Her tireless struggle as a woman is worthy of admiration. The details of her experience are as follows:</p>
<h3>Motivation for Going North</h3>
<p>Ms. Yao's motivation for going north came after the signing of the ceasefire agreement of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. At that time, Ms. Yao was a student in the 19th Route Army's regimental student corps. Upon hearing the news, she was extremely indignant. She gathered several comrades and planned to visit the army commander, Cai Tingkai, to request an introduction to fight the enemy in the Northeast. General Weng Zhaoyuan learned about this and readily offered to provide the introduction. Ms. Yao and several comrades then fulfilled their wish to go north to fight the enemy and set off with a letter from General Weng.</p>
<h3>Going to Beiping to Join Geng</h3>
<p>Ms. Yao and several comrades originally planned to join Ma Zhanshan's troops, but when they arrived in Beiping, the roads were blocked. They changed their plans and joined Geng Jizhou's unit. At that time, Geng was in Beiping and had contacts with the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association. Ms. Yao bravely stepped forward and once single-handedly captured five enemy Mauser pistols, shocking the entire army.</p>
<h3>Captured in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Ms. Yao was once captured in Shenyang. At that time, Ms. Yao was working as a liaison for the Northeast Volunteer Army, responsible for communications. She traveled alone to the east, venturing on her own. Although she encountered danger many times, she was able to turn danger into safety. However, with collaborators everywhere, danger lurked everywhere. Once, Ms. Yao was ordered to go to Shenyang to plan an uprising. She was discovered by a collaborator, who reported it to the Japanese military headquarters. They sent personnel to arrest her.</p>
<h3>Escaping by Taking Advantage of the Situation</h3>
<p>After Ms. Yao was arrested, she was imprisoned in the Japanese military headquarters in Shenyang, where she was heavily guarded. Ms. Yao, having already dedicated herself to the country, regarded death as a return home and remained calm. The Japanese thought that Ms. Yao had no intention of escaping, so the guards gradually relaxed. It happened to be a time of heavy rain and wind. Ms. Yao devised a way to saw through her shackles, destroy the iron bars on the prison window, and jump out the window. She killed a Japanese guard, seized a rifle and a bayonet, and fled back to Beiping.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation</h3>
<p>Recently, Ms. Yao sent a letter from the Northeast to her brother, lawyer Yao Zhaoli, saying that although the territory of the Northeast has changed color, the hearts of the people have not died. They are still struggling and fighting. However, the border region is harsh, and after autumn, the roads are covered with wind and snow. The anti-Japanese soldiers are fighting in thin clothes, unable to withstand the invasion of the northern winds. During the anti-Japanese campaign in Chahar, there were seven student soldiers from the Special Service Regiment of Zhang Renjie's unit of the Provisional Third Division of Song Zheyuan: Ju Muren, Zhu Xueming, Huang Xiegeng, Yu Gengsheng, Jin Zhong, Shao Tianxi, and Ni Huaixin. Their whereabouts are still unknown.</p>

It was rumored yesterday that Mr. Song was planning to go to Hangzhou for a rest in the coming days. According to his staff, speaking to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter yesterday, no decision has been made yet.</p>
<h3>Sugimura Departs for Fujian and Guangdong Yesterday; Funatsu Accompanies Him to Promote Japanese Yarn Activities</h3>
<p>Sugimura Yotaro, after resigning from his position as Deputy Director of the League of Nations Secretariat, came to China in the name of touring and investigating the situation in various places, under the orders of the Japanese government. He has traveled through the three northeastern provinces, Hebei, and Shandong. After arriving in Shanghai, he hosted banquets several times for diplomatic personnel and important merchants of various countries in this port, lobbying them. He traveled south yesterday at 11:00 AM on the Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Shengjing Maru. Japanese Consul Ishii Jutaro and Japanese government officials and merchants saw him off. He is expected to arrive in Fuzhou in three days, and then proceed to Xiamen, Shantou, and the Pearl River Delta, before returning to Japan to report his findings. Funatsu Tatsichiro, a leader in the Japanese yarn industry in this port and a Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, also accompanied him on the voyage. It is said that Funatsu is representing the Japanese yarn industry and is traveling to the southwest to promote activities.</p>
<h3>Customs Treasury Bonds Exchanged as Usual Yesterday; Rumors of Postponed Issuance; The Bank Has Not Received Orders</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the ten million yuan of Customs Treasury Bonds for the 22nd year of the Republic of China, issued by the Ministry of Finance, began to be exchanged at the Treasury Department of the Central Bank on the Bund in Er Ma Lu at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, a Beijing dispatch stated that because of Song Ziwen's resignation and Kong Xiangxi's failure to take over, the Shanghai banking community had requested a postponement of the issuance, pending Kong's assumption of office, before discussing the issuance date. The Xin Xin News Agency reporter went to the Treasury Department of the Central Bank yesterday to inquire. A spokesperson for the bank stated that since the exchange of the bonds began the day before yesterday, banks and money shops have been eagerly presenting their subscription vouchers for exchange. A total of 26.4 million yuan were exchanged throughout the day. As for the report that the Shanghai banking community had requested a postponement of the issuance, the bank has not received an order from the Ministry of Finance, so the exchange is proceeding as usual.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Control Council to Rescue Low Cotton Prices; Discussions Actively Underway; Purchasing Cotton Not Yet Necessary; Researching Improved Planting Methods Based on Expert Investigation Reports</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that because domestic yarn factories have a large number of yarn stocks and cotton prices have plummeted again, causing unexpected setbacks for the factories, the National Cotton Industry Control Council held its third regular meeting at its office on Monday afternoon of this week to discuss ways to rescue the falling cotton prices and improve cotton planting methods. A considerable decision has been made. The meeting will continue at the next meeting. As for the rumor that the council has decided to borrow one million yuan from banks to purchase a large number of cotton stocks from the factories to raise cotton prices, the Xin Xin News Agency reporter asked a member of the council yesterday for clarification. According to the member, the Cotton Industry Control Council is responsible for controlling the cotton industry. All matters concerning rescuing the plummeting cotton prices and improving cotton planting must be planned and implemented comprehensively, which cannot be done with empty words. The Cotton Industry Control Council is currently discussing and studying this matter. The rumor that funds are being prepared to purchase cotton is not yet necessary. It was also learned that Sun Enxiang and Feng Zefang, cotton industry experts from the council, went to Hubei and other provinces to investigate cotton planting. They have now completed their work and recently went to Nantong and other areas for investigation. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai in the coming days to report. The council will study and implement improved methods based on the reports of the investigations by the two experts, Sun and Feng, in various places.</p>

<h3>Arrest of Seven Masterminds in the Kidnapping Case of the Son of a Night Soil Collector; Other Perpetrators Committed 11 Robberies; Preliminary Hearing of Kidnapping Case Adjourned Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chief Detective Wang Cheng, Detectives Yang Xiguang, Wang Jinshou, and Detective Liu Zhongcheng of the Jiaxing Road Police Station previously arrested 13 bandits from Jiangbei, including Wang Jinshan, Li Guijiang, Chen Desheng, Pan Ru Gao, and Zhan Fenglin, seizing one handgun and four bullets. After Chen, the bandit, confessed that on April 27th of last year, at about 6 AM, Yan Shirong, who is at large, initiated the kidnapping of Fu Hai, the four-year-old son of a Fuing native employed as a night soil collector by the Public Works Department, residing at No. 722 Weiwei Road. The boy was hidden in the countryside of Chongming, and was later ransomed by his family for a large sum of money. At the time, Yan's wife and the accountant, Xiang Wenshan, were also involved. The police arrested Yan's wife, Chen, and Xiang. Xiang then confessed that the mastermind was Wang Zilin's wife, Yan, and that the accomplices were her son-in-law Xu Xuesun, worker Yang Yuexiang, and Mu Xiao Sizi. The detectives arrested Wang Yan and others and sent them separately to the First Special District Court. Zhan Fenglin was released after it was determined he was not involved, and the rest were returned to custody. Details of the interrogation have been recorded in this newspaper. The police stated that the kidnappers were Zhen Desheng, Xiang Wenshan, Yang Yuexiang, Mu Xiao Sizi, Xu Xuesun, Yan Chen, Wang Yan, and seven others. The remaining five, including Wang Bi, Yi Desheng, Duan Jiyou, and Shi Baoxian, who were arrested by the Putuo Road Police Station, had committed a total of 11 robberies in the Public Concession. Yesterday afternoon, the two police stations jointly sent the male and female defendants to the Second Criminal Court, where Judge Wu Zehan presided over the interrogation. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that there were many defendants in this case, and that all the victims of the 11 robberies were present in court, so there would not be enough time for interrogation. He requested an adjournment. There were only seven defendants in the kidnapping case, so he requested a trial. It was determined that Pan Rugao and Shi Baoxian were not involved in the robbery case, and they were released. Gao was represented by lawyer Fan Gang. Lawyer Zhang also stated that according to Chen Desheng's confession at the police station, Yan Shirong, who is at large, proposed kidnapping Wang Fuhai and invited him to discuss it at the Sihai Teahouse on Wuzhen Road, Zhabei, asking him to participate in the kidnapping. Because Chen was a Jiangbei bandit with many associates who were used to doing bad things, on the night before the incident, he was told to go to No. 11 Jun'anfang, Tianmai Road, Zhabei, which was Yan's home. At about 4 AM that morning, Yan hired a black car to come. Those who went with him were Yan Shirong and his wife, Chen, and Xiang Wenshan, as well as three unnamed individuals, Qian Wenlin, Wang Decai, and Xu Zihong, for a total of seven people. Yan, Wang, and Xu each carried a handgun. They drove to the victim's house, and Yan and Qian went inside, entering through the back door. Chen, Xiang, Wang, and Xu were outside as lookouts. After a while, gunshots rang out. Soon after, Qian Wenlin carried the child out and handed him to Yan Chen, fearing that the child would cry, using the woman. He did not know where the car drove to, and he returned home. About ten days later, he met Yan, who gave him one hundred yuan and told him to leave Shanghai quickly. Yan Chen confessed at the police station that she went with her husband and Chen Desheng, Xiang Wenshan, and several strangers. Her husband and Chen Desheng carried the child and handed him over to her to drive to Huishan Wharf and return. Later, her husband returned and said that the child was hidden in the countryside of Chongming. Shanghai was not a place to stay, and he planned to go to Jiangbei to avoid the wind, with Xiang Wenshan taking the daily expenses. She had already agreed with Xiang. Xiang pointed out that the masterminds were Yan Shirong and Wang Yan, and that Xu Xuesun, Yang Yuexiang, and Mu Xiao Sizi were also involved. She stated in court last time that she went to kidnap the child, and that Yan gave her 200 yuan after the dispute. Chen Desheng was interrogated and confessed truthfully. Yan Chen and Xiang Wenshan completely denied the confessions made in court last time and at the police station, claiming that they were not involved in the case and that the previous confessions were false. Yang Yuexiang, Mu Xiao Sizi, Wang Yan, and Xu Yunsu were questioned and denied everything, the same as last time, and asked the court to be clear. Wang Zilin, for his part, said that Xiang Wenshan, worker Yang Yuexiang, Mu Xiaosizi, etc. had been employed by him for many years and that their conduct had been good in the past. Moreover, Xiang was in Suzhou when the incident occurred and later received a letter from Daguangheng notifying him to return to Shanghai. Yang Yuexiang also returned from Jiangbei. He treated them well and did not think they would collude in the kidnapping. Perhaps Xiang Wenshan was falsely accusing the four of them due to long-standing grievances. Wang Yan and Xu Yunsu's lawyer and Yang Mu's lawyer asked for bail. Judge Wu ordered Chen Desheng, Xiang Wenshan, and Yan Chen to be returned to custody, and the hearing was postponed to the afternoon of the 7th of this month. Wang Yan and Xu Yunsu each paid 3,000 yuan in bail, and Yang Yuexiang and Mu Xiao Sizi each paid 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>European Buddhist Monks Departed for Beijing Yesterday; Guan Jiongzhi and Others Saw Them Off at the North Station</h3>
<p>Thirteen Buddhists from France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and other countries, including, Bhikkhu Virananda, Apollositi, Bhodhi Ubalu, Anukong, Bajia, Bati, Rafawufa, Basha, Xipu, Darubi, and others, arrived in Shanghai on July 25th and went to Jue Lu's residence on Daxilu in this city to study Buddhist rituals and the main points of various scriptures. According to a reporter from Heping News, the thirteen, led by their teacher Zhao Kong, took a fast train to Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at 9:00 AM yesterday to receive the full ordination from Master Ruo Shun at Qixia Temple on Qixia Mountain in Nanjing. In addition to preparing a letter of introduction, the Chinese Buddhist Association specially sent Cai, a student studying in Germany, to accompany them as a translator. Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, and others went to the North Station to see them off.</p>
<h3>World Buddhist Laymen's Association Establishes Buddhist Library</h3>
<p>The World Buddhist Laymen's Association in this port already has a library with a collection of various Buddhist scriptures and images. Recently, in view of the fact that there is no Buddhist library in the country, it has specially built seven two-story buildings along the road to serve as a Buddhist library. It has been actively arranging things in recent days and is quite busy. It is reported that it will be open to the public within the month. It is also learned that in addition to the existing Pinjia Tripitaka, the Continuation Tripitaka of the Commercial Press, the Japanese Revised and Continued New Tripitaka, and a Song Dynasty Tripitaka reprinted by the Association for Reprinting Song Dynasty Tripitakas, the library has also purchased various scriptures published by various sutra engraving houses and bookstores in the country, and welcomes all circles to inform them of the titles and publication information of various scriptures or Buddhist books that are privately printed or published, so that they can be purchased successively to complete the collection.</p>
<h3>Post Office Adds New Stamp Sales Counter</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office, for the sake of stamp collectors, has newly opened a counter dedicated to serving these customers, so that they have sufficient time to inspect newly issued stamps, avoiding inconvenience to the public.

<h3>The Discovery Process of the 70,000 Yuan Robbery Case; Detectives Solved the Case After Two Months of Effort; The Strange Iron Box Was a Clue in Solving the Case</h3>
<p>On September 6th of this year, the Ningbo Kenye Bank branch entrusted Wei Yuming, the No. 2 steward in the first-class cabin of the Xinning Shao Steamer, to bring 70,000 yuan in cash to Shanghai. The money was stolen by robbers en route, leaving only a little over 100 yuan. After the case occurred, Wen Hong'en, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, strictly ordered Lu Ying, Captain of the Detective Squad, to solve the case within a limited time. However, ten days later, on the morning of September 14th, Han Tinghu, a patrolman from the Second Precinct of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly discovered a strange iron box at the entrance of Yaojia Lane. A hole had been chiseled in the bottom of the box. The size and all the iron sheet construction of the box were exactly the same as the original stolen box. Captain Lu believed that it was related to the theft case and secretly ordered Gu Liancheng, the leader of the team, to secretly investigate in order to solve the case. The details of the process have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the case has been solved completely due to the efforts of Team Leader Gu's investigation over two months. The details are disclosed below.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Success</h3>
<p>After receiving the secret order, Team Leader Gu immediately began investigating the source of the iron box at the entrance of Yaojia Lane. He immediately rushed to the Second Precinct of the First District and carefully inspected the box. He also went to the Kenye Bank to compare the size of the stolen box, which was roughly the same. At the same time, he requested the Public Security Bureau to prepare an official document to the Shanghai Local Court to bring Shao Rongpei, the suspected steward of the Xinning Shao Steamer, who was in custody, to the team for questioning. He learned that a person from Anhui named Tang Shixiong had significant suspicions in this case. He also learned that Tang currently lived at No. 84 Tangjia Lane, Xiaodongmen. He inquired about Tang's clothing and appearance. Thus, the case achieved preliminary success.</p>
<h3>Disguised Surveillance</h3>
<p>After learning Tang's address, Gu first went to the place alone to investigate. He saw that there was a clothing store in the house, and many beggars were gathered around the house. After thinking it over and over, Gu explained the case to the owner of the clothing store and led detectives Gong Fujin, Zhou Peisan, Xu Youliang, Hu Kuisheng, and Shen Jinchu to disguise themselves as beggars or rickshaw pullers and wait around the house. He sent another person to be a tailor and stationed there to investigate. However, after waiting for many days, no one came and went. However, at 4:30 PM on the 14th of last month, a person suddenly came, took the household registration certificate nailed to the door, and hurriedly went west.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Man and Woman</h3>
<p>Seeing the person coming and going in a hurry, Gu expected that he would report the relocation to the household registration office of the police station, and quickly sent someone to follow him. Sure enough, he reported the relocation. When the person returned, he disappeared at the entrance of the alley. Fortunately, Gu and others had arrested a man and a young woman in the house. The man's name was Tang Shihao, the brother of Tang Shixiong, and the young woman was his sister, Tang Shihao was 27 years old and opened a Xin Gong Ji customs broker at the Huiguan Square in the Sixteenth Street. The young woman married Weng Zhongliang as his wife. The two led the team and interrogated them. According to Tang Shihao, he was in charge of business in the firm. His brother sent his nephew to tell him to go to his brother's place. When his brother met him, he said that he was about to leave Shanghai and that Shanghai was no longer a place for him to stay. When asked what was wrong, he said, "Haven't you seen the 70,000 yuan theft case reported in the newspaper? I committed it. I'm leaving. You can take care of the family. The nephew can study in the firm. I'm going back to my hometown of Fengle River in Hefei." Then he sent 3,000 yuan to his sister for storage. A leather suitcase containing 4,000 yuan was taken to his mother's house in Liuhe by his sister-in-law, and 5,000 yuan was deposited in the bank by his brother-in-law Weng Zhongliang. Sheng Dexing came and said that Shao Rongpei, who is now in custody, wanted to get him acquitted and needed 1,000 yuan to pay for it. This time, he came to cancel the lease of the house, which led to his arrest.</p>
<h3>Confession of the Truth</h3>
<p>Tang Weng, 23, who married Weng Zhongliang, opened an Weng Yixing iron shop at No. 151 Beishanxi Road, said that the previous night her sister-in-law and second brother brought a leather suitcase and asked her to store it without moving it. When asked what was stored inside, she replied that it was money. When asked where so much money came from, she replied that it was never going to be a good source. She took the key to open it and saw that it was indeed money. Her sister-in-law went to Liuhe and gave 5,000 yuan to her husband to deposit in the bank. Her second brother borrowed 1,000 yuan, her aunt borrowed 600 yuan, and she redeemed a pawn for 500 yuan. Apart from what has already been spent, the rest can be returned to the case. Subsequently, Gu Liancheng and others separately arrested Wei Yuming, the No. 2 steward of the Ning Shao Steamer, at the entrance of Dacheng Lane, Sheng Dexing, the No. 8 steward of the Ning Shao Steamer, at No. 4 Ruyi Hutong, Hongsheng Wharf, and Weng Zhongliang, Tang Shixiong's brother-in-law, at Tie Mao Lane. 1,600 yuan in stolen money was recovered from the Lujiangheng Xing Cigarette Paper Store on Yancheng Street, Liuhe, and 4,000 yuan in stolen money was recovered from the flat house at No. 5 Pingjili Road, French Concession. They were interrogated separately, and the answers were roughly the same. However, Sheng Dexing and Shao Rongpei had become ill in prison and were sent to the Xinpu Yutang for treatment. Sheng had a habit and was deeply addicted to opium. He died of the disease. Shao Rongpei followed him. The court was notified to send someone to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Principal Culprit Apprehended</h3>
<p>Gu Liancheng led Gong Fujin, Zhou Peisan, Xu Youliang, and others to Hefei to arrest Tang Shixiong. They hired a boat along Wuhu and Chaoxian, etc., and went to Fengrong River, which is a rural town about 80 miles from the city. It was all dry land. The county government sent Xu Shoucui, the captain of the detective squad, and two detectives to stay overnight in the town. Tang Shixiong was found to be living in the west wing of a teahouse. He was finally arrested in Swallow's Nest. Tang's actions were very generous and there was no resistance. The town chief, Tang Shiyao, was a member of Tang's clan. When Duan Hefei was in power, he once served as a military governor. He is now training the local militia to protect his hometown. When Gu and others went, Tang Shiyao did not hinder them because Shixiong's crime was too big. There were many bandits along the way, but fortunately, nothing unexpected happened. The suspect arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Captain Lu interrogated Tang, who confessed as follows:</p>
<h3>Burning Incense and Swearing Oaths</h3>
<p>The idea for this case came from Shao Rongpei, Zhang Abing, Chen Rongfu, Xu Xiaomao, etc., who said that the steamers coming and going carried large amounts of cash. They held a meeting in a Zhejiang hotel and discussed finding a coppersmith to make a duplicate key, and Zhu Azhang bought rotten iron potion to test it, but it didn't work. Later, they chiseled it open with an awl and succeeded. Sheng Dexing invited me to join. We went to the City God Temple to burn incense and swear oaths and take photos. When stealing, I dressed as a wealthy guest in the first-class cabin, and Zhu Azhang acted as a servant, taking the opportunity to get to know Wei Yuming, the steward. It took more than a dozen trips. Finally, we stole the money and used an oil drum to hold the cash. We went to Dexing's house on Anren Street to divide it. Sheng initially gave me 10,000 yuan and later added 4,000 yuan. I used to be a fruit seller. After losing my job, I was fortunate to be helped by my brother. This case was really deceived by Sheng Dexing.</p>

<h3>Effeminate Pederast Exposed; Both the "Rabbits" and the "Rabbit Pimp" Were Arrested; Each Sentenced to 15 Days of Detention</h3>
<p>In recent years, male prostitution has become very competitive in Shanghai. The likes of "male courtesans" and "young masters," which were popular in the north, have also emerged in response to the trend. The clothing of these people is almost completely feminized. At first glance, they are almost indistinguishable from women. Only those with experienced eyes can easily distinguish between male and female. They are often found in hotels and wine shops, and nothing is more detrimental to social morality than this. In view of this, the Public Concession police authorities have specially ordered all subordinate police stations to strictly ban this practice. Li Shugui, a detective from the Lao Zha Police Station, learned that the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road was a den of male prostitutes. The most famous rabbits in Shanghai, such as Zhong Xueqin, the rising star Langman, and Fei Qinghudie, are hiding there. They hide their tracks during the day and come out at night to operate. Xueqin has gradually grown older and, although she has not yet left the life of a male prostitute, she lives a secluded life. Langman and others are shameless, using their charm like foxes to lure young people to the hotel to engage in various activities. The other day, he reported to the police chief, and at 10:00 PM, he drove to investigate and arrest them. They tied up the two rabbits in Room 401. Bao Dabao (also known as Lao Ba), a Jiangyin native who lived off the rabbits, was also arrested. At that time, the two rabbits were putting on makeup and acting coquettishly. Langman was wearing a long cheongsam and a short black velvet vest, while Fei Qinghudie was wearing a long vest over her cheongsam. The rabbit feet were all wearing floral shoes, and the rabbit heads had their hair permed. Langman also had a flower pinned to her chest, while Fei Qinghudie was holding a purse. Those who saw this kind of strange decoration would feel like vomiting for three days. They were still complacent and struck a pose of self-pity. They were about to leave the room together, not knowing where they were going to solicit customers, when Detective Li arrived and was tied up by them and taken to the police station along with Bao. It was learned that the two rabbits still had their own dens, one on the upper floor of the Zhongdatong Electric Material Store in Yunnan Road, Sanma Road, but they entered and exited through the back door, and the other on the upper floor of the Sufuxing Porridge Shop at the intersection of Yunnan Road, Sanma Road. Langman's surname was Zhang when he was a human, and his name was Xiaohong. He was originally from Wumen and was only 24 years old. The name Langman was his name when he was a male prostitute. Fei Qinghudie only had this name whether he was a human or a male prostitute. Some of his colleagues called him Wang Lao Jiu. He was born in Ningbo. Bao Dabao, the rabbit pimp, nicknamed Lao Ba, was born in Jiangyin and was the oldest, now 34 years old. Fei Qinghudie was the youngest of the three, only 22 years old. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court. Although these people are engaged in indecent acts as a profession, they were not caught in the act when they were arrested, so it was difficult to punish them according to the law. They were prosecuted according to Article 43, Section 3 of the Police Penalty Law. Shen Shanzeng, a judge of the police court, conducted the trial. For a time, people who were curious heard about it and came to the court to listen, and it was unusually crowded. In a short time, there were too many people. According to the confessions of these people about their experiences in this lowly profession, Langman has been a rabbit for three years, and Fei Qing has been a rabbit for only two years. Bao Dabao has been with rabbits for the longest time, for twelve years. After Shen finished interrogating and weighed the situation, he sentenced each of them to 15 days of detention as a warning. The male prostitutes were immediately taken to the prison and locked up.</p>
<h3>After the End of the Strike in Xiamen, Goods at Swire Congested</h3>
<p>Swire informed from their Xiamen branch that the strike by dockworkers in Xiamen had stopped under the advice of the authorities, and that the company's Nan Wah ships would continue to run as usual to Shanghai. Shanghai has already sent an order to Swire, and in the next couple of days the Yingzhou and Jinhua ships will be loaded with goods to Xiamen and Shantou. Furthermore, the number of goods intended for transshipment at Xiamen and Shantou is even greater than the number of local Shanghai goods.</p>
<h3>Jilin Headquarters Report: Song's Troops Strategically Defeat Japanese and Puppet Forces; Volunteer Army Operations in Southern Jilin Disrupt the Enemy, Making it Difficult to Establish Order</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association yesterday received another official document from the Standing Committee of the General Command of the Jilin Volunteer Army, reporting on the situation of Commander Song's troops in southern Jilin and requesting assistance. The original text is as follows: "Submitted for Reporting: Song Guorong, acting commander of the Second Provisional Army, reports that in Fabei Gou, Lizi Gou, Yumu Qiaozi and other places in Huadian County,</p>
<p>they engaged in battle with Japanese soldiers. Requesting review and instructions. On August 19th, Wu Zhonghui, commander of the 1st Cavalry Brigade, was operating in Fabei Gou, south of Huadian County, when they encountered over a hundred Japanese soldiers. Both sides exchanged fire, resulting in five enemy casualties and one wounded soldier on our side. On August 28th, the commander led 150 officers and soldiers of the guard to Yongan County, Jilin to inspect the territory. When they arrived at Lizi Gou in Huadian, they were preparing to distribute lunch when suddenly about two hundred Japanese soldiers were discovered from the southwest,</p>
<p>carrying mortars and machine guns. By the time our sentries spotted them, the enemy was already close. Both sides opened fire, each taking up defensive positions. The enemy, relying on their abundant ammunition and strong firepower, showed no weakness. The commander, seeing the disparity in numbers, decided</p>
<p>to use surprise tactics to win. He sent the battalion commander Ge Yousheng, with two light machine guns, to flank the enemy from the left, attacking them from both the front and rear. The enemy, fearing this, fought and retreated. After the battle, an inspection of the battlefield revealed six enemy soldiers killed. Our troops lost two saddle horses. People were dispatched to scout the enemy's whereabouts, discovering that the enemy was encamped at Yumu Qiaozi. That night, our army also encamped near the battlefield at Erdao Gou. At dawn the next morning, the entire force proceeded towards the enemy's encampment, searching and advancing along the mountain terrain. They opened fire outside the kiln gate.</p>
<p>The enemy, caught off guard by the gunfire, panicked and resisted desperately, successively fleeing. Both sides exchanged fire, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy, unable to withstand the assault, fled towards Huadian County. An inspection of the battlefield revealed</p>
<p>fourteen Japanese soldiers killed, five large and small guns seized, and several horses killed. Although our army consumed a great deal of ammunition, the officers and soldiers were safe. The meritorious officers and soldiers were commended to boost morale and the enemy corpses were burned on the spot and the area was quickly evacuated. On the 30th,</p>
<p>five enemy aircraft flew around the engagement site for several weeks, before heading east to Badao Hezi, where they bombed the 5th regiment of the division, dropping over twenty bombs. Fortunately, our troops were dispersed and sustained no major damage. Currently, the Japanese and puppet forces have set up a combat headquarters at Yantong Shan on the Jihai Road, planning to use large forces to conduct a joint land and air suppression. In order</p>
<p>to contain their military operations, a unit of Commander Mao's forces, numbering over four hundred, carried out extensive railway destruction in Hei Tai Gou, Lao Ye Ling, and other places, causing enemy armored vehicles and trains to derail multiple times, resulting in several victories. This is the situation from the late August to early September. As autumn turns to winter, the weather is already cold. Can assistance be provided for clothing and ammunition,</p>
<p>so as to disrupt the enemy's military and political affairs in the long term, making it difficult for them to establish order? These matters are submitted for review and instructions." The said army has repeatedly performed meritorious service in the southern Jilin area, and the above-mentioned points are considered to be factual. I earnestly request your association to provide assistance as appropriate to show encouragement and replenish their supplies. These matters are hereby submitted for review and instructions.</p>
<h3>The Civil Aviation Joint Transportation Controversy: A Statement from the Joint Transportation Authorities</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's contract with the Ministry of Railways for national water-land joint transportation has provoked opposition from private shipping companies in Shanghai. The Shanghai Navigation Association has petitioned the central government, requesting that all private shipping companies be included in the joint transportation. A reporter met with the person in charge of joint transportation yesterday, who stated that the main point of the Ministry of Railways granting joint transportation rights to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and not signing contracts with some private shipping companies is that water-land joint transportation is important for the convenience of transferring goods, and the key point is that the shipping industry must have complete facilities. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has become state-owned, it has its own docks and warehouses at any port along the Yangtze River or the coast, allowing passengers and goods to be loaded and unloaded at any time. Other private shipping companies, except for those in Sanbei, generally do not have docks or warehouses. Shanghai is like this, let alone other ports. This is one reason. The shipping companies under the Navigation Association number over fifty. If they were all included in the joint transportation, the Ministry of Railways would have to sign a contract with each shipping company, which is practically impossible. For example, the Longhai Railway's Lao Yao line signed a joint transportation contract with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company this time, not only at the most balanced freight rate, but also stipulating unloading at the Puxi wharf, which is something that general private shipping companies cannot undertake. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider that if joint transportation contracts were signed with a large number of private shipping companies, based on the past state of the shipping industry, the shipping companies would inevitably undercut each other in competition, potentially leading to chaos. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with its state-owned status and its own docks and warehouses in ports across the country, occupies a superior position in shipping facilities, and it is only natural that it undertakes joint transportation. However, the company believes that once national water-land joint transportation is implemented, it is aware of the importance of passenger and freight transportation, and will ensure its rapid turnaround, increasing tonnage. It has already added chartered ships. The Kunxing vessel of the Zhaoxing Company has been leased, and the three ships of the Dazhen Company will also soon cooperate. However, in practice, there may still be a surplus of cargo. The company is currently considering a distribution method, examining the transportation situation of various lines and the current routes of private shipping companies, and allocating the remaining cargo to various private shipping companies for loading. For example, the goods on the Wuchang line are mostly carried by Sanbei ships, so they will be allocated to them. The goods on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line can be allocated to the Ning Shao Company. The goods from the Northeast will be allocated to the Zhaoxing shipping company, and so on. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is only integrating the overall joint transportation, and is not monopolizing all the freight transportation in the country. The overall contract has been reviewed by the Ministry of Railways. After the necessary amendments are made, the chief of the Joint Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways, Yu, will sign it first, and then bring it to Shanghai for Liu Hongsheng to sign. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company saw a news report that the Shanghai Navigation Association had petitioned the central government to request that all private shipping companies be included in the joint transportation. It also submitted a petition to the central government, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company undertaking joint transportation of state-owned railways with private shipping companies, explaining the benefits and harms of participating in joint transportation, and detailing the methods for maintaining civil aviation and cooperating after implementation. It is reported that this petition has been submitted.</p>

<h3>Dong Kang Hired to Give Lectures in Japan on Ancient Chinese Legal Systems</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st: Jiji News Agency reports that the Republic of China Legal System Research Association, organized by Dr. Shoji Matsumoto and others, is known for its research on ancient and modern Chinese legal systems and jurisprudence. However, in recent years, academic research on this topic in Japan has become rather lukewarm. In view of this situation, they have planned to revitalize their research and have decided to hire Dong Kang, a leading figure in this field, to come to Japan to lecture on legal studies, in order to promote mutual understanding between the Chinese and Japanese legal communities. Mr. Dong is currently scheduled to depart from Shanghai on November 8th and is expected to arrive in Tokyo on the 11th. It is reported that the topics of his lectures will all be specialized discussions on the ancient Chinese legal system.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Flood Relief Committee Ships 60,000 Sets of Cotton Clothing; Director Zeng Donates 1,000 Sets to Aid Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee previously commissioned the Hui Li and Mei Da Companies to produce 100,000 sets of cotton clothing. As of the end of October, 60,000 sets have been delivered and shipped by the committee to the disaster areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan for distribution. The remaining 40,000 sets are scheduled to be manufactured and shipped by the 12th of this month. However, the area affected by the Yellow River flood this year is too large and the number of victims is numerous. The aforementioned cotton clothing is still not enough. Director Zeng Rongpu of the committee is donating 1,000 sets of new cotton clothing for women and children, and has handed them over to Director Xi Dejiong of the committee's disaster relief group for distribution in the disaster areas to help the affected people.</p>
<h3>Transporting Clothing and Food to Relieve Qidong</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association and the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association are jointly managing relief efforts, as previously reported. Recently, they shipped four hundred shi of fine rice and eleven hundred shi of white rice in batches. Directors Qiu and Lu commissioned the purchase of five hundred shi of wheat in Qidong. Due to the large scale of the disaster and limited funds, the relief is insufficient. The association has now added seven hundred shi of rice, totaling two thousand four hundred shi of rice, and two thousand five hundred sets of new cotton clothing, which can all arrive in the disaster area soon. Directors Qiu and Lu will investigate the disaster-stricken households and distribute the supplies after verification. However, it is reported that there are 40,000 to 50,000 disaster victims who are starving and waiting to be fed, and the relief supplies are not enough to make a difference. It is hoped that philanthropists at home and abroad will show compassion and continue to contribute.</p>
<h3>World Red Swastika Society Launches Campaign to Collect Cotton Clothing for 10,000 People</h3>
<p>The Yellow River breached its banks this year, and the severity of the disasters in various provinces is unprecedented. At this time of year, when the golden wind cuts to the bone, the victims are still wearing single layers of clothing, and many children are still naked. Winter is approaching, and it is evident that those who do not die from the flood will inevitably die from hunger and cold. Previously, the headquarters of the Red Swastika Society sent circulars to Red Swastika Societies in various places and published advertisements in newspapers in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hangzhou to widely collect cotton clothing to benefit the disaster victims. It is now reported that the local Red Swastika Society and the Baoshan Red Swastika Society have launched a campaign to collect cotton clothing for a ten thousand-person group, and have submitted it to the headquarters for consideration in order to collect a large quantity of cotton clothing to universally save the disaster victims. The local Red Swastika Society has received a telegram from the headquarters, which is recorded as follows: "To the Red Swastika Societies in all provinces and counties, The Yellow River flood has affected several provinces. Although the society has dispatched relief teams to provide assistance, it is now approaching autumn, and most of the victims are destitute. Winter is approaching, and there is a risk of death from freezing. The society sent circulars to all societies, requesting them to widely collect cotton clothing to benefit the disaster victims. The responses received from various societies show enthusiastic donations. However, the disaster area is too large and the need for relief clothing is immense. The number of collections at present, when distributed to the disaster areas, is no more than a drop in the bucket, and is not enough to make a difference. Recently, Zhang Jun Qianmiao, Ni Jun Ducici, Jiang Jun Qianliu, and others from the Shanghai General Office stated in their letter that Hu Huayi, president of the Baoshan Red Swastika Society, has specially joined forces with the Chinese Moral Society, the Lianyi Charity Association, and the Bodhi Dharma Association and other charitable organizations to launch a campaign to collect cotton clothing for a ten thousand-person group. The method is that each initiator collects ten sets of cotton clothing, and every ten people form a group. For those who entrust the clothing to be made, each person pays a clothing price of twenty yuan. They are now actively proceeding and are very enthusiastic. It is proposed that the headquarters telegraph various societies and request them to mutually solicit donations, so that over ten thousand sets of cotton clothing can be collected quickly. This method is very simple and direct and can be imitated. In addition to sending a copy of the letter, this telegram is specifically sent to your society to inquire and imitate. It is hoped that the number of donations will be reported to facilitate liaison and distribution. The World Red Swastika Society."</p>

<h3>Main Suspects in Counterfeit Currency Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Yonggui and Sun Aizhong, Chinese detectives from the Huishan Detective Office, arrested Deng Rongting, a Shandong native, near the intersection of Xinjibang Road and Seward Road at 1:40 PM the day before yesterday for selling counterfeit banknotes. They found twenty five-yuan counterfeit banknotes from the Bank of Communications and two counterfeit central double-corner banknotes on his person. Under interrogation, Deng confessed that he had purchased the counterfeit banknotes from Ding Yuqing, who resided at No. 12 Mingde Road, Zhabei. The detectives, along with detectives from the Fifth Precinct of the Second District, went to the address to make the arrest. However, the sub-landlord claimed that Ding had moved elsewhere half a year ago. Upon investigation, it was discovered that Deng's family lived at No. 182 Shanqing Lane, Allenby Road. They immediately went there to search for evidence and found Deng's wife, Zhang, in bed. They found seven silver dollars in her pocket, including one "Yuan Ding" coin, and a mold for manufacturing counterfeit "Bian Jiao" coins in the stove apron, containing a lead angle blank, as well as batteries, copper wire, white powder, silver ingots, iron pots, pliers, and other items. According to Zhang, these tools were left by a friend, Li Shaozhou, who was hiding at No. 11 Jiuruli, Qiujiang Road, in the Chinese Settlement. The detectives, along with detectives from the Second Precinct of the Fifth District, went there quietly at midnight, surrounded the place, and arrested Li and his wife, Zhou. However, no evidence was found during the search. They were then taken to the local Public Security Bureau for detention. Deng Rongting and his wife, along with the evidence, were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the detective office, recounted the events and stated that when the detective office went to transfer Li Shaozhou and his wife, it was claimed that they had been sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requiring a letter from the court. It was requested that both defendants be detained and the investigation be postponed. Following Chen Huamu's report on the process, various pieces of evidence were presented for inspection. Judge Wu Ze interrogated the two defendants and then ordered them to be remanded in custody separately for further review at a later date.</p>
<h3>Zhang Naiqi Lectures on the Way Out of the World Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>The Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA specially invited Mr. Zhang Naiqi, president of the China Industrial Bank, to lecture on the way out of the world economic crisis the day before yesterday. The audience was enthusiastic, and the lecture was very concise and thorough. The lecture was quickly recorded by Bing Xun and promptly recorded by Social, and excerpts of the main points are as follows: The way out of the world economic crisis is how to find a solution during this period of world economic panic. The most important causes of the panic are nothing more than overproduction and unemployment. Some believe that overproduction is due to insufficient consumption. This is true, but insufficient consumption is actually due to the unresolved unemployment problem. For example, there is a surplus of cotton and wheat in the United States, while at the same time, many people have no clothes or food. In New York, since the economic panic, 70% of the apartments are vacant, but countless people still sleep on the streets. These people are all unable to consume clothes, food, and housing due to unemployment, creating the current state of panic. Regarding unemployment, workers make up the majority. The main reason for worker unemployment is that machines are replacing human labor. Modern new machines only require a small number of senior workers to manage the machines, and they can produce. Therefore, workers' rights are being taken away by machines. Currently, the countries claiming to have solutions are Germany, Italy, and the United States. Since Hitler came to power in Germany, there have been no significant achievements. There are still 5 million unemployed workers. Italy has 3 million unemployed. The so-called Fascist leader Mussolini also has no fundamental solution to the unemployment problem. US President Roosevelt is based on the position of farmers, but at present, some farmers are actually revolting against Roosevelt. This shows that the US recovery plan will inevitably fail. Therefore, the so-called solutions of the United States, Italy, and Germany are nothing more than giving a few morphine injections. Although countries are currently advocating for increased wages and reduced working hours, wages increase but prices increase even more. Work cannot compete with machines. In short, the organization of modern society cannot accommodate modern civilization. Modern production systems cannot accommodate modern productivity. Therefore, the world's last struggle is only a second world war. In this way, a large number of surplus goods can be transferred to military supplies, and the unemployed can also join the army. However, this is only the last morphine injection.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Asylum</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mental Hospital, located at Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, in this city, since its opening to the present, including April, has treated more than 60 men and women from this city and other places who sought treatment for mental illness. Two-thirds have been cured. There are also more than ten male and female lunatics who were sent to the hospital for treatment by the Special District Court and the Gu Police Station. Under the careful diagnosis and tireless efforts of the hospital director, Gu Wenjun, and with the patience and dedication of the male and female nurses, the achievements are remarkable. It is reported that last month, Luo Wencai from Guangdong and Kunling Wang Xiaofang, both suffering from madness, were admitted to the hospital for treatment and have now been cured and discharged.</p>
<h3>Sino-German Art Exhibition to be Held in Shanghai First, Lin Fengmian and Others Suggest Three Methods, Detailed Masterpieces to Avoid Criticism from All Parties</h3>
<p>The Berlin China Art Exhibition, which is scheduled to be held in Berlin, Germany, in the spring of next year, caused quite a stir among the Chinese people after the news of the items being sent abroad in mid-November was announced. It is well known that the responsibilities of the association are heavy, and the collection of works seems to be too hasty. Therefore, there are many who have raised questions after Tu Qi, Gao Ai, and Lin. In order to avoid criticism from the Chinese people, the committee members Lin Fengmian, Lin Wenzheng, Qi Baishi, and others suggested that the association imitate the example of participating in the Chicago Exposition and hold a preliminary exhibition in Shanghai to dispel doubts and show fairness. The full text of the proposal is as follows: Dear Sirs, We were shocked to learn from the newspaper that the Berlin Sino-German Art Exhibition will depart on November 14th. The China Art Exhibition held in Germany this time represents our country's culture and is presented to the international community. It is of the utmost importance to the future of national culture and art. We should widely collect and carefully undertake to win glory for the nation and status for art. We heard that the scope of this collection is limited to a local area, and the advertisement for the collection in the newspaper was short-lived and failed to publicize widely. Not only are the Chinese people still largely unaware of the association's collection methods and the people who produce the works, but also the majority of domestic artists have never received any written notice of the collection. The collection is not universal, and its works are not enough to represent the Chinese people and are too hasty to go abroad. No wonder the newspapers are full of complaints. The mission of our association is to collect the essence of art and seek international honor. If the collection is not enough to represent the Chinese people, the country will spend huge sums of money, and the original intention of seeking glory will turn into humiliation. The committee members in office ask themselves, can they resign? Fengmian and others are members of the committee, and their responsibilities lie in not being silent. We propose that the association (1) postpone the departure of the collected works and publish the list of producers in the newspaper to show fairness, (2) conduct a second universal collection to widely collect works and strive for excellence, and (3) hold a preliminary exhibition of the Sino-German Art Exhibition before going abroad, in accordance with the example of participating in the Chicago Expo, in order to select in detail and dispel doubts. In this way, we will not fail the heavy trust of the country, the earnest hope of the Chinese people, and the future of art. I offer my humble opinion and respectfully await your adoption. To the Preparatory Committee of the Berlin China Art Exhibition, Preparatory Committee Members Lin Fengmian, Lin Wenzheng, Qi Baishi.</p>

<h3>A Robbery Occurs in Lujiazai</h3>
<p>Hu Changming, a native of Baoying, is over fifty years old. He used to live in a shed built of cement on land in Lujiazai, Pudong. Recently, because the landlord demanded the land back, the family moved to a rented flat in No. 2 Maoyeli nearby. Hu was a worker at the Xiangsheng Iron Factory in Lujiazui. He has a wife, Yu, who is fifty years old, and an only daughter, Xiuzhen, who is fifteen years old. She is quite beautiful and is a sixth-grade student at a certain elementary school. She is very intelligent, so her parents love her dearly. Because the family is frugal, they have saved a little money over the years. However, they still have no son, so they have arranged for a son-in-law to join the family.</p>
<p>Son-in-Law Comes to the Door Recently, a friend introduced Xia Xiaosan from Nanjing to be the son-in-law of Hu. However, because Hu's daughter is still young, it was agreed that the marriage would be postponed and Xia would move in to live with the family first, as a young son-in-law. An auspicious day was chosen the day before yesterday, and the matchmaker brought Xia to Hu's house. The young couple did not perform the wedding ceremony, but Hu still held a banquet to celebrate. When the son-in-law arrived, he brought a dowry of fifty yuan, hoping that the two would get married when they were a little older. Unexpectedly, a tragedy occurred, and the young bride died unexpectedly, which is really tragic.</p>
<p>Thugs Commit Robbery At about 10 PM last night, when the family was not yet asleep, three thugs, each holding a pistol, suddenly broke into Hu's house. They first snatched a gold-plated bracelet (made of silver) from the hand of Hu's niece, who had come to eat wine and had not yet returned. Seeing Xiuzhen and her mother, Yu, coming, the thugs immediately raised their guns and fired at the mother and daughter, firing four or five shots in succession. Xiuzhen was shot in the right ribs, the bullet penetrating deeply and not coming out, and she fell to the ground on the spot, dying. Yu was also shot in the left shoulder, the bullet passing through the upper part of her left waist, and she also fell to the ground unconscious. After the shooting, the thugs fled, their whereabouts unknown.</p>
<p>Daughter Dies, Mother Injured At that time, Hu was also in the room. Suddenly hearing the gunshots, he staggered out and saw his old wife and beloved daughter lying in a pool of blood. Only his niece was not shot. He then called people to carry the two injured to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. Xiuzhen died on the way. When Yu arrived at the hospital, she was also unable to speak. The hospital, seeing that her life was in danger, immediately ordered her to be transferred to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The reporter saw that Xiuzhen's eyes were wide open and not closed, looking extremely terrifying.</p>
<h3>Woman Upset After Failing to Find a Job Commits Suicide by Taking Poison</h3>
<p>Chen Xiuzhen, a woman from Yangzhou, was twenty-three years old, with a beautiful appearance. Her family lived at No. 1216 Yufuli, Mahuo Road. She studied at the Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School on Weihaiwei Road. Her father, Chen Jinwen, used to run a hotel, but it closed down due to poor business. Recently, he has been unemployed at home. Seeing this, she dropped out of school this summer and applied to various places, such as the Sun Sun Company and the Customs, intending to find a decent job to help with household expenses. However, the results were not accepted. As a result, she was unhappy and suddenly had the idea of ending her life the day before yesterday. She secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. Later, her father saw her groaning in bed and foaming at the mouth, and realized something was wrong. He immediately sent her to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported to the New Gate Police Station, and detectives were ordered to investigate. They then carried the body to the forensic examination office on Ferren Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the office to examine the body. According to the statement of the deceased's father, Chen Jinwen, the circumstances were as described above. Guo Jun ruled that the deceased, Chen Xiuzhen, a woman, had indeed died of opium poisoning before her death. The body was handed over to her father, Chen Jinwen, who signed a certificate to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>The Grand Occasion of the Family Industrial Society Giving Away Invincible Gift Boxes</h3>
<p>The Family Industrial Society pioneered domestic toothpaste, defeating the Diamond Lion. Its contribution to regaining rights has long been praised. Recently, it invented a kind of Invincible toothpaste that can make scorched black and yellow teeth appear white immediately. Its raw materials, fragrance, function, and effectiveness are comparable to imported products priced at one dollar and eighty cents, and even surpass them. In order to awaken the general dream of being fascinated by foreign goods, it has sacrificed 10,000 gifts since yesterday. Anyone who buys Invincible toothpaste has the hope of winning a valuable gift. Yesterday, many valuable items such as watches, combs, powder mirrors, and earrings were given away. On Nanjing Road, anyone carrying an Invincible brand paper bag looked happy.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I read a news item in your newspaper on October 31 about a fire at the City God Temple, which stated that the fire was caused by the explosion of a power plant substation, which caused the lights to go out and candles to start the fire. This is not in accordance with the facts. There was no explosion at any of our company's substations that night. However, when the fire broke out on Anren Street, we received a call from the fire brigade, informing us that the fire on Anren Street had burned our company's wires. We immediately sent workers to the scene to disconnect the wires. Afterwards, the switch in the substation was turned on. In fact, the substation was not damaged first. We are afraid that the rumors are untrue, so we specially wrote this letter to correct them. We hope that the editor will publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Thank you very much. To the Shen Bao, The China Merchants Electricity Company, 1933/11/1</p>

<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>Review of the National Goods Year | Pity the National Goods Sung All Over the Streets, Only to Win More Madness for Japanese Goods |</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>This year is the National Goods Year. What are the achievements of the National Goods Year? Apart from the exhibitions held in Shanghai and other places and the establishment of national goods companies, I can't think of any good achievements in these ten months. Only the number of banks has increased, like bamboo shoots after the rain. I heard that there are still more than thirty banks that have registered with the government but have not yet opened. Yan Junxiong said, "This year, it is better to say National Goods Year than Bank Year."</p>
<p>This statement makes a lot of sense. But are the many banks opened to support industry and commerce and promote national goods? Do they provide various conveniences for production and sales? Do they sincerely and strongly grant loans to factories so that they have the opportunity to maintain and develop? The facts show that very few of them do this. The majority of people are used to dealing with government bonds and real estate. How can they risk getting involved in the complex and troublesome factory business? People tend to be easy and fear difficulty, take the smooth road and avoid the dangerous road. Their views are all like this. So the pitiful national goods business has no backing to expand. Factory managers, in addition to improving products and striving for sales, also have to run around to raise funds. This is so difficult. So banks are banks, national goods are national goods. Although there are many banks, they are of no help to the national goods business. Look at Europe, America, and Japan, it's the opposite. Not only is the banking industry united as a backing for industry, but the government is also desperately helping factories and sincerely supporting industry, always looking for opportunities to promote products. With the development of Japan's national goods business, the government and banks are desperately supporting it, so today's Japanese goods can be so rampant in the world. The pitiful Chinese only shout empty slogans and make empty noise, which is not of much benefit to the actual national goods business. Now even the shouting and noise have not been heard. Batches of inferior goods are openly sold in the commercial ports. In the North China region, there is a phenomenon of Japanese goods dumping. According to a Tianjin telegram on the 27th of last month, Nagoya's products were displayed in Tianjin, and the visitors were very crowded. In one or two days, there was a shocking transaction of 100,000 yuan. They entice Chinese people with extremely low prices, so European and American overseas merchants also change their trademarks and completely sell Japanese goods because their own products cannot compete with Japanese goods. This is such a heartbreaking thing. Even in Shanghai, unscrupulous merchants sell Japanese goods even more unscrupulously, sacrificing their personality for some money. It is said that just speaking of cloth and fish, the amount has reached more than five million in the past month. Whose responsibility is this? People are still playing deaf and dumb. Woe is greater than heart death. If the Chinese and Shanghainese have blood, will they just sit and wait for death? Alas! National Goods Year, National Goods Year, it is sung very loudly, but the result is like this. We should not blame the unscrupulous merchants without shame or conscience, but blame ourselves for not setting up a systematic and organized overall plan when we set this National Goods Year in the beginning. What is the plan? How to divide the regions horizontally and how to divide the periods vertically, what to use as the center, and what to use as the backing? There must also be a unified strategy, and it must follow the method of Japan's economic invasion of the Yangtze River area in the report from Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Bureau of Commerce, in view of the lack of control over trade with China, is seeking to form an export association to China, which is a more powerful opinion. At the same time, it is restrained by the anti-Japanese goods movement in central China, and attaches importance to the Yangtze River area when the export association is established.</p>
<p>Talks on National Goods</p>
<h3>Controlled Economy and National Goods Industry</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the consciousness is offensive or defensive, a controlled economy contains the significance of construction, and although the goal of construction is the national economy, the foundation of construction is national capital. Of course, our national capital, apart from land production, in this industrialized modern era, naturally cannot forget the national goods production sector in its budding stage. Therefore, China should not implement a controlled economic policy, but if under the banner of a controlled economy, the national goods production sector is neglected, then it will not be able to obtain its satisfactory results.</p>
<p>We recognize that China's urgent task at present is to seek rural revitalization, but there is an inextricable causal relationship between rural revitalization in China and the development of China's national goods production industry. When the National Goods Movement began this year, we reminded that promoting national goods should not forget to relieve rural areas. Today, we must loudly call for rural revitalization to not forget promoting national goods.</p>
<p>This is very simple. Although the decline of China's rural economy is due to the direct causes of natural and man-made disasters, the crux of the problem lies in the exhaustion of money due to the absorption of international capitalism. The anemia that forms the economic state, the blood-sucking germs in society, are imported goods. Therefore, it is not impossible for us to point to them as our source of disease. Therefore, in today's re-planning of rural revitalization, we must understand the true cause of rural decline, and understand the significance and value of national goods production and the promotion of national goods movements in coping with imported goods. Then, we learn from past mistakes and naturally understand the importance of national capital. Only by promoting national goods can we avoid the economic blood-sucking bacteria 丨丨imported goods.</p>
<p>In other words, the so-called purpose of rural revitalization is to reconstruct the rural economy. If, after the rural economy is restored, the dumping of imported goods remains, and foreign goods are used to develop the market, it is certainly not worthwhile, and the disease-causing germs that were previously put in place will be bankrupted again, waiting for the economic blood cells to be sucked dry again. The most important purpose of a controlled economy is to seek self-sufficiency. Before expanding national financial resources, we should first pay attention to preserving existing financial resources and making society tend to be peaceful: therefore, in the overall effort, we should not forget to promote national goods when revitalizing rural areas.</p>
<p>Because national capital and national capital are a whole, the abnormal development of rural areas and the abnormal development of cities are an example of no good results: most rural products need to be sold by cities. If Chinese agricultural products are not used as raw materials for China's national goods industry, it is impossible in the world economic downturn, and using them as raw materials for imported goods at low prices also loses the meaning of rural revitalization. However, for cities to be able to purchase agricultural products, just as the vast market for national goods is in rural areas, there is a close relationship between them.</p>
<p>Rural revitalization and promotion of national goods have a mutually causal relationship, and can only be rationally adjusted under the overall planning of a controlled economy. Therefore, in the current wave of controlled economy, we loudly call for rural revitalization to not forget to promote national goods, and at the same time remind ourselves that promoting national goods should not forget rural revitalization.</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3>How to Promote National Goods to the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Li Boshu</p>
<p>Introducing the Caiqiao Farmers' Cooperative</p>
<p>See Huang Yingdai's article "The Countryside and the National Goods Movement" in the previous issue, which roughly says that we should go to the countryside to promote national goods. He said that the Chinese countryside is also in a period of Westernization, and a group of farmers are also learning to wear top hats and tweed pants. In short, they are slowly being Westernized. If this Westernizing force gradually expands, it will be very dangerous in the future. After reading it, I immediately had a question: How to go to the countryside to promote national goods? Of course, on the one hand, we should go to the countryside to publicize the importance of promoting national goods, but I have always believed that the effect of publicity is not as good as actually doing it on the ground. Therefore, my hometown 丨丨 Caiqiao 丨丨 has organized a farmers' cooperative in the past two months. I think this cooperative is the best tool for selling national goods. Because the countryside is far from the city, purchasing is very inconvenient: moreover, once farmers go to the city, they see colorful, cheap and beautiful foreign goods, and they can easily change their minds and unconsciously purchase foreign goods. Therefore, opening cooperatives in rural areas, national goods are bound to sell well.</p>
<p>This farmers' cooperative was initially prepared by several comrades who were enthusiastic about the national goods movement. Later, they solicited farmers to voluntarily join for several shares, each share was one yuan. Finally, it exceeded more than 1,000 shares, so they carefully prepared everything for the practical use of farmers, and took national goods as the principle. Sure enough, it started operating on September 10th, and it felt very appropriate. As for its method, it is to purchase goods at the cheapest price, and then slightly increase the original price and sell it to the farmers. At the end of the year, the end will be once, of which 60% of all surpluses will be used to purchase dividends, and distributed to the farmers according to the amount of purchase: 30% of the profits shall be used for bonus for the stockholders, distributed according to the shares, and 10% shall be used for local public welfare matters. In short, this farmers' cooperative has many direct and indirect benefits for farmers, and at the same time, it is the best tool for promoting national goods in the countryside! Comrades who are enthusiastic about promoting national goods! Caiqiao Farmers' Cooperative is the pioneer of farmers' cooperatives. Let us quickly rise up to continue to organize, so that it gradually becomes popular, and we must also bear the responsibility of improvement, so that it can gradually be carried forward. This is my sincere hope and expectation.</p>

<h3>Eighteen Chats by Zhang Mengzhao</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang two years ago, when the Japanese devils caused a rebellion, the literati and officials sighed and hated it, while merchants rejoiced, because the opportunity to hoard enemy goods had arrived. After the five-minute fever of the Chinese people had passed, the enemy goods spread like mercury, and the most sufficient proof of the iron-like fact is that Shanghai Sanyang and other ten empty sock factories bought enemy yarn in large quantities and counterfeited our Shenxin newcomer clock brand, causing a smoky atmosphere. In the end, the clouds dissipated and the fog disappeared. Now there are also eight cases of Shenfeng Rice Shop and other eight companies selling enemy rice. When the wind comes against the tide, the waves are ten feet high, stimulating society, and I am afraid that the result will be the same as the previous one.</p>
<p>Ten factories are treacherous, and joining forces is good. It's another strange shame of two nine's and eighteen's!</p>
<p>Our Wuxi has a common saying that calls those who exploit heavy profits in small money shops "money lice," and calls rice shops "rice weevils." It's the same kind of naming. I think these three names symbolize yarn traitors and rice traitors. They clothe people and feed people. What kind of country is this? Alas, treacherous merchants!</p>

<p>Special Education News</p>
<h3>Zhou Fotao's Announcement to Teachers and Staff of Provincial Secondary Schools on Implementing the Exclusive Appointment System</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Secondary Schools, from this academic year onwards, uniformly implement the system of exclusively appointed teachers, which is of utmost importance to the future of education in our Jiangsu Province. Therefore, I would like to make a few brief remarks to my fellow teachers and staff.</p>
<p>In recent years, secondary education in Jiangsu Province has relied on the efforts of fellow teachers and staff to gradually enter the right track and move towards progress. However, upon examining the actual situation, it is still far from the ideal realm. Therefore, in order to achieve fundamental reform and ensure sound development, we must have deep expectations for the efforts of you gentlemen in the future. How to enable you gentlemen to concentrate and not be burdened, we must also make definite plans. Considering the financial difficulties and the difficulty of making a living, those who serve in education may inevitably be distracted due to the burden of life. Therefore, I, in the time of extremely limited funds, overcame all difficulties and implemented the system of exclusive appointment. For the tasks, we have set fair limits. For salaries, we strive for possible increases. It is necessary to have a stable life in order to focus one's mind. The regulations, from the perspective of individuals, may not be the most respectful and preferential treatment, but from the perspective of the public, the cost of increasing the annual fee has already exceeded 100,000, which is more than that of teachers in local primary schools. Comparing hardships and happiness is already very different. Compared with the salary cuts of general civil servants, the treatment is also different. The treasury is empty, and funding is not easy. Due to the limitations of facts, what I have done for you gentlemen is almost exhausted here. The difficult situation will be understood by you gentlemen. I hope that you will consider the difficult times, devote all your efforts, treat the school as a home, treat students as family members, brothers and sisters, and take improving education as your own responsibility, and work together to seek fundamental reforms and achieve sound development, then the happiness will not be only for me alone.</p>
<p>Speaking of fundamental reforms today, there is no other way than to correct the academic style and enrich academic ability. Therefore, I promulgated the method of combining teaching and training last year as a norm for transforming the academic style, and this year I formulated the teaching progress of each subject as a standard for improving the level. At the beginning of the creation, after several discussions, we also widely consulted, and we have exhausted the way of careful beginning. Gu Liang's method is implemented, and it is at the end of manpower. Just like sailing, the production is ingenious, but if the boatman cannot devote himself to the direction of driving, it will never be possible to show its use for crossing rivers and sailing. Therefore, if you want to stand up and make it work, and if you want it to be effective, it depends on how hard those who are responsible for promoting it are.</p>
<p>The combination of teaching and training and teaching progress are both the first regulations created in Jiangsu Province, and they are the foundation for improving education today. The success or failure of the results should be viewed by the whole country. If it can be successful, China's education can open up a new opportunity. If it fails, China's education will be difficult to improve. The rise and fall of Chinese education is also related to the honor and disgrace of you gentlemen. What are the interests in this, Ning waits for more words. Moreover, teaching without asking about training and management, and teaching without adhering to a fixed schedule, is not only abnormal, but also a chronic disease. If education is not eliminated so far, bankruptcy can be expected. You gentlemen have experienced it deeply, and you must agree with this theory. Therefore, all the regulations are originally inherent functions, and returning to the original is what it should be. It is neither an exceptional responsibility nor an extra constraint. Please do not say that it is too complicated and difficult to handle, and worry that it is difficult to make arrangements, and have hesitation in your mind. But if you can exhaust your personal strength, there will be spiritual comfort. If you can have the determination to put it into practice, you can receive the effect of influence. The great plan of cultivating people is a century-old project. I will never force people to do what is difficult, nor will I blame people for quick results. I only hope that with the power of subtle influence, we can achieve gradual and daily renewal, and make the academic style more and more upright and the level higher and higher, then what we expect has been achieved, Ning has other requests.</p>
<p>Moreover, education is a spiritual career, not just a job for making a living. You gentlemen have been engaged in education for many years, and your usual aspirations must be far and great. You will never use the level of treatment as the standard for effort, and enlightened and ambitious people will be able to establish a firm and outstanding integrity even in the midst of adversity. I sincerely do not want to apply the word "supervision" to you gentlemen, and what I hope for in my heart is to seek you gentlemen to take the determination to serve automatically and jointly complete the major mission of improving education. I speak earnestly, and I hope you will learn from it. (October 22nd)</p>

<h3>Inside Story of the Turmoil at the Peking University Women's College of Arts and Sciences</h3>
<p>Peking University was reorganized from the merger of several universities. The previous universities were changed into colleges of engineering, agriculture, medicine, law, commerce, and women's liberal arts (the college of art was cancelled), and they were located in various places. They belonged to Peking University, and another president was appointed. Because of the independent relations between the universities in the past, the university was established in the Department of Education, and the colleges were equal to provincial schools. The power of each college has been going on for a long time (not like the power of each college of the Central University is concentrated in the president of the university). In the event of major events, the president and the deans do not fully agree on how to handle them, and problems often occur. It is heard that the Peking University Women's College of Arts and Sciences has been in turmoil since July for expelling students, and it is still lingering and it is not known when it will be completely resolved. The inside story of the turmoil is explored as follows:</p>
<p>The cause of the turmoil was on July 10th. The students first opposed the merger of the departments (the three departments of Chinese, English, and History were merged into one department, with three groups). They sent six representatives to see President Xu Songming and then changed their attitude to oppose Dean Gu Cheng. After expelling student Liu Mingqi, the turmoil subsided, and four accomplices of the expelled student told everywhere, complaining to the Supervisory Yuan. It happened that a certain supervisory committee member and a certain English department director who had recently left the college (the director was also the director of the Department of Northern Normal University. Because the regulations of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences restrict the director of the department from holding concurrent positions, he resigned invisibly) were related. After receiving a little advice, he went to the school to investigate the case in mid-September. These four accusing students thought that the supervisory committee member had come to the school and regarded him as a backing, so they caused trouble again. Those who were deceived also joined in signing the letter. On September 16, the supervisory committee member sent the student's petition back to Dean Gu Cheng and sent a female secretary to the school to ask the students. As a result, the students increased their momentum and made trouble again. On September 17, Dean Gu sent a reply to a certain supervisory committee member. The supervisory committee member already understood the truth. Then, when Dean Gu sent the bookkeeping and receipts to a certain supervisory committee member, the supervisory committee member was unwilling to investigate the 70 or 80 students again. Because the law had no basis and the complaint could not be made, he surrounded Dean Gu's home in late September. Gu was not at home. The next day, he blocked the dean's office. Gu telegraphed the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education replied and ordered severe punishment. President Xu Songming thought that it was necessary to expel the students. He held two college affairs meetings and decided to expel the students. However, on the night of the same day, after President Xu and the three people who attended the college affairs meeting held a secret meeting in Dongxinglou, the next day, the attitude of the colleagues at the college affairs meeting suddenly changed. They thought that expelling the students was giving face to Dean Gu and it was not everyone's public opinion. Xu Songming asked someone to ask Gu to resign. Gu asked himself that he was not wrong, so how could he escape from the battle? He said that the president could remove me from my position, but it was not convenient to resign. Xu had no way. Gu sent the official document of expelling the students. Xu allowed Gu to announce the expulsion of 16 students who took the lead in causing trouble on September 27. Before the expulsion, a notice was issued stating that more than 20 students who stated that they did not participate would be reserved and not investigated. After the expulsion, the Ministry of Education sent a telegram saying that if they expelled them first, and if they made trouble again, they would be disbanded and wait for identification. Xu, acting President Songming, did not show the Ministry of Education's reply to Dean Gu first, but only advised Dean Gu to resign, fearing that the turmoil would expand. Gu said that he did not want to retain his position and must resign after the turmoil subsided. On the 28th, President Xu sent two people to the college to talk to the students, saying that Gu would resign immediately, and after the resignation, the expelled students could restore their student status. The students did not make trouble that day. On the 29th, Gu brought a letter of resignation and explained orally that his position could be sacrificed, but he could not restore his student status in order to rectify the academic style. Although Xu allowed it, he went to the Ministry of Education in early October to discuss the method of restoring student status, but it was not approved. Xu returned to Ping around the 20th. He said that he still allowed the 16 expelled students to attend classes at the school, and he would find a way to do it in the future. The students were dissatisfied because the restoration of student status had not been completed, and the English department lecturer and staff who were dismissed midway caused legal disputes (see the recent World Daily). It is not known when it will be resolved. It is heard that since Gu Cheng took office as the dean of the college in August last year, he has implemented regulations: (1) Students who are absent from class for one-third of the time will be suspended from school for one year (a total of 40 or 50 people were suspended), and those who fail the exam will be retained in grade (5 or 6 people). Those who do not pass the degree after four years of study will not be allowed to graduate (1 person). (2) Professors who are absent from class for more than one-tenth of the time will have their salaries deducted by five yuan per hour. In this era of perfunctory education and fear of student unrest, such strict methods do not conform to the trends of modern youth, and it is also a remote cause in the turmoil.</p>

<h3>Rapid Advancement of Mass Education in Recovered Bandit Areas: Mass Education Design Council Compiles the First Phase of Readers; Provincial Mass Education Commission Meeting Drafts Various Rules</h3>
<p>(Hankou News) Since Chairman Chiang issued a clear order to the provincial government authorities to pay attention to improving mass education in the counties recovered from the bandit areas, in order to eradicate the bandit ideology, education administrative officials at all levels in the province have spared no effort in implementing it. Although it has not been long, the rapid advancement of mass education in various districts and counties has great prospects for development. At the same time, the Provincial Education Design Council is also rushing to finalize the plan to promote its implementation. The mass education situation in various districts is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Design Council Rushes to Compile Mass Readers: The Mass Education Design Committee for the Recovered Bandit Areas has compiled and printed mass readers. The first volume has been re-examined and sent to print. The content of the teaching materials pays close attention to the invasion of banditry. The subjects are as follows: (1) My name and age, (2) We are all Chinese, (3) How many people are there in China, (4) Save the country, (5) The party flag and the national flag, (6) Mr. Sun Yat-sen, (7) The Three Principles of the People, (8) The Taiping Song, (9) If you want a good body, (10) Air, (11) Good people, (12) Selecting seeds, (13) Planting trees, (14) Beekeeping, (15) Mutual aid group, (16) Literacy and work, (17) Iron, (18) The poisonous plan of the Communists, (19) A letter, (20) Buy national goods.</p>
<p>The Mass Education Association Drafts Various Rules: The Provincial Mass Education Committee, at 2:00 pm on the 23rd, decided to discuss matters at the first conference of the association, cases 4, 5, and 6, and sent letters to Wang Yizhou, Xiang Xinkui, Section Chief Song, Li Bogang, Yin Yuanxun, Zhang Zhian, and Zhou Jie, members of the committee, to attend together, draft the procedures for implementing mass education in the whole province, raise funds for mass education in the whole province, and improve mass entertainment, etc. It is also heard that they have been drafted separately on the same day and will be submitted for discussion at the next conference.</p>
<p>Liu Fu Bans Clan Schools and Private Schools: Liu Fu, the administrative inspector of the Third District, has spared no effort in rectifying the elementary school education in the counties under his jurisdiction. It is heard that he has dispatched education committee members to various districts to inspect clan schools and private schools, and issued a general school situation form for each district to fill in carefully during the inspection. He also ordered the district chiefs to strictly ban clan school teachers who have not been inspected and to avoid favoritism to avoid misleading students.</p>
<p>Li Jianai Strictly Prevents Banditry in Elementary Schools: Li Jianai, the administrative inspector of the Eighth District, believes that the Communist Party's propaganda is pervasive. In order to prevent the Communist Party from invading, he has issued a notice to the county governments under his jurisdiction, ordering schools at all levels to strictly prevent Communist Party activities in elementary schools, in order to prevent hidden dangers and curb the rebellion.</p>
<p>Shi Yuling Promotes Rural Education: Shi Yuling, the administrative inspector of the Sixth District, believes that when inspecting education matters, he often ignores the rural areas and loses the purpose of popularizing education. Therefore, he has drafted an outline of the plan for implementing mass education in rural areas in the district, which will be implemented step by step from this year, and has collected textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education and compiled three volumes of teaching materials with reference to local needs, so that the masses can have general knowledge while becoming literate. He has submitted it to the higher authorities for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Lu Xian Strictly Selects Elementary School Teachers: Lu Xian, the administrative inspector of the Ninth District, said that the second inspection of elementary school teachers in the district has been completed, and from now on, he will begin to interview each person who is admitted and the graduates of the rural teacher training school. A total of 142 people, including Wang Yourong, have passed the inspection. Among them, 35 people have bad habits. After verification by the inspection certificate, the inspection certificate will be issued immediately.</p>
<p>Li Guojun Urgently Runs a Simple Normal School: Li Guojun, the administrative inspector of the Eleventh District, said that the counties under his jurisdiction have been affected by banditry for years, and education has been damaged. Now that banditry in each county has been gradually suppressed and order has been restored, we should catch up and strive for revitalization. However, there is a lack of teachers, and teaching is not without people. Now, in accordance with the general outline of the local education revitalization plan of the Department of Education, he has consulted the Department of Education to allocate funds from the treasury and ordered the Provincial Eleventh Middle School in the district to run two simple normal classes for training in order to improve.</p>

<h3>The Great Deeds of Seven Children: The Xin'an Children's Touring Group Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday. The Oldest is Seventeen, the Youngest is Twelve. No Teachers, No Elder Brothers to Lead Them. Leaving School, Leaving Family Life. Publish an Open Letter to Children.</h3>
<p>In order to test new educational ideas, the Xin'an Elementary School in Huai'an has specially organized a children's touring group, entirely managed and lived by the students themselves. The group of children, including Yang Yongxin and six others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Zhenjiang, where they were received by Huang Jingwan of the Commercial Press and taken to visit the Civic Education Center, the Zoo, the Vocational Education Society, and the Youth Propaganda Group. The fact that this group consists entirely of elementary school students between the ages of twelve and seventeen who have voluntarily embarked on a long-distance trip is truly a pioneering event in China's educational circles. We are recording the details of their journey in the hope that those involved in children's education in this city will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>List of Group Members: The members of the group are Zuo Yihua, Cheng Changlin, Jing Bingquan, Yang Yongxin, Jing Bingduo, Liu Zhaolang, and Zhang Junqing, totaling seven people. Their responsibilities are assigned as follows: Yang Yongxin is in charge of Public Relations, Zhang Junqing is in charge of Accounting, Zuo Yihua is in charge of Medicine, Cheng Changlin and Liu Zhaolang are in charge of Records, and the position of Chairman rotates among them.</p>
<p>Code of Conduct: The code of conduct for the children's touring group is as follows: (1) Hold a morning meeting and an evening meeting once a day; (2) Do morning exercises and evening exercises once a day; (3) Write a diary entry every day; (4) Brush teeth, rinse mouth, and wash face once a day; (5) Have a bowel movement once a day; (6) Drink boiled water several times a day; (7) Do not eat miscellaneous foods; (8) Do not leave the group without reason. This code of conduct may be amended at any time and will be implemented from the date of departure. The itinerary for visits will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Details of Departure: According to Yang Yongxin, the public relations officer of the group, in an interview with a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency, the group of seven children departed from Huai'an on October 20th and first went to Zhenjiang to visit various schools and educational institutions. They came to Shanghai along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and arrived yesterday. They will visit Shanghai for a few days and then return. He also said that when they were at school, all daily tasks such as carrying water, cooking, washing clothes, and sweeping were shared by everyone in turn. They had practiced other activities such as growing vegetables, building roads, bricklaying, editing weekly publications, and performing dramas for four months before setting out on this trip. There are no teachers leading them, and their travel expenses are covered by a subsidy from the school and by selling books and giving speeches along the way. He then showed the reporter a letter to the children of Shanghai and requested that it be published. The letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>An Open Letter to Children: Dear Children, We are a touring group organized by seven children. We are now setting off for Zhenjiang and Shanghai. We are leaving school, leaving our families. There are no teachers, no elder brothers to lead us. Everything in our journey is just us seven children leading ourselves, managing ourselves. We are setting off from the ancient, desolate, rural Jiangbei to the prosperous, cultural, metropolitan Jiangnan. The purpose of our trip is: First, to see the scenery of Jiangnan and to understand the substance of social sciences such as geography, history, customs, and folkways in practice; Second, to see modern industrial culture and to understand the function of natural sciences in practice; Third, to see the battlefields of Zhabei and Shanghai and to understand the brutality of imperialism and be effectively encouraged to work hard to become strong; Fourth, to break the misconception that adults do not trust us children to have the ability to act independently and freely. But all of this, in summary, is to test our school's educational idea: "Society is School." Dear Children, We have put on our straw sandals, draped ourselves in untidy clothes, and set off with our small luggage on our backs. The nation is facing great difficulties, we are the masters of the nation, our responsibility is great, we must have rich experience in all aspects of social life, broaden our horizons, increase our strength, and temper our spirit to not fear hardship or difficulty, otherwise how can we bear this heavy burden? Dear Children, When you receive this letter from us, you will surely find this to be a very interesting thing. We hope that a large-scale children's touring group will appear soon, touring all of China and the world, to be pioneers for the children of our great Republic of China, and to fight for the honor of our great Chinese nation. This trip of ours is extremely difficult. Our families are very poor, and our school is also poor, but after our plan was decided, we proceeded separately and received enthusiastic support from teachers in society who sympathized with us. We are grateful for their encouragement, but our travel expenses are very insufficient, but we are ignoring these difficulties and boldly moving forward. There must be many people in society who are seeking happiness for us children, as long as our actions are reasonable. Dear Children, We are setting off on our journey, goodbye, wishing you all the best in your efforts! Sincerely, Xin'an Elementary School Children's Touring Group.</p>
<h3>City Education Bureau Orders Public Times Middle School to Close: Failure to Report the Re-election of the Principal According to Procedures; the School's Current Management is Also Ordinary.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to Huang Shenzhi, the principal of the private Public Times Middle School, stating that the Bureau has not received any record of the school's recent reorganization of the board of directors or the re-election of the principal, and that the procedures are not in compliance. Previously, the Municipal Government instructed in order No. 07461, stating, "Received and acknowledged. The school's reorganization of the board of directors and re-election of the principal were not reported to the competent authority. Such private transactions and advertisements to attract students are like the transfer of a store, and this trend must not be allowed to continue. The Bureau should immediately investigate and prohibit this, and send personnel to investigate the school's current management. If there are any improprieties, the school should be ordered to close immediately and make other arrangements for rectification to uphold education. Please comply and report accordingly." Having received this order, the Bureau sent personnel to investigate the school's current management. The report stated that the school building is rented from private houses, and the lighting and air quality are not up to standard. All equipment is makeshift. There are currently only 28 students in total, 15 in junior high school and 13 in senior high school. The curriculum is organized in a single-grade system for the first year of junior and senior high school, and a combined-grade system for the second and third years. There are 13 faculty and staff members, two of whom are part-time. In short, the school has deep-rooted problems, has lost credibility, and is on the verge of collapse. Given its current state, it is quite ordinary. The reorganization this time did not follow proper procedures. For the sake of regulating private schools, it seems appropriate to order the school to close to avoid misleading students." The report also included the Municipal Government's instruction No. 7926, which stated, "Received and acknowledged. Approved as requested. Please comply immediately and report the situation accordingly." In response, the school's reorganization procedures were not in compliance, and its management was inappropriate. The principal should be ordered to close the school immediately, and, in accordance with the Ministry's order, submit the student registers and supporting documents to the Bureau for verification. Please comply and report accordingly.</p>

<h3>Jiangda Football Competition: Competition Begins on the 11th. Jinan Still Has Championship Hopes</h3>
<p>The Jiangda Sports Association football championship is scheduled to begin registration on the 3rd of this month (i.e. tomorrow, Friday), and the competition will begin on the 11th of this month. This year, Jinan University still has hopes of retaining the championship. Fudan and Jiaotong are also very strong, and the competition in the future will definitely be very intense.</p>
<h3>Overseas Filipinos, With a Disorganized Formation, Lose to Jinan: Results of Last Night's Friendly Basketball Game. The Score is Twenty-Five to Thirty-Four. The Overseas Filipinos Will Face Strong China Tonight.</h3>
<p>The Philippine Overseas Chinese basketball team played against Jinan University last night at the China Basketball Hall. Both teams were agile and the interest was good, but there were few highlights. Jinan used volleyball and football stars, and Xu Heng served as the defender. The defense was tight and solid, giving the Philippine Overseas Chinese team few offensive opportunities. Long shots were unreliable. Jinan was able to lead all the way and was invincible. The result was 34 to 25, Jinan won. The half-time score was 17 to 12.</p>
<h3>Jinan Has Great Potential</h3>
<p>Jinan has average talent, is brave and decisive, and is indeed a rising star. The presence of the tall Xu Heng, combined with excellent support, makes the formation more compact. Yin Guiren and Wang Nanzhen are representatives of the Shanghai basketball team for the National Games, and their reputation is well-known. The center of Han Zhenyuan is also rarely seen at the moment. In addition, Wang Weixi, Gu Shangkuang, Ye Peichu and others are all all-rounders in offense and defense. Jinan will have great potential in this year's basketball season. If the second-rate players had not been used last night, the score difference would not have been so close. The Philippine team moved very fast, but often suffered from the disadvantage of wanting to achieve quick success. They had no confidence in shooting and few opportunities for close throws. In addition, the formation was disorganized and there was no fixed front line, so they were always subdued. In terms of overall strength, Jinan is much better than the Philippine Overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>The Philippine Community Struggles in Vain</h3>
<p>The game started at 7:00. The five tigers of Jinan were active and exceptionally fierce. The Philippine Chinese community was under heavy pressure everywhere, struggling in vain. Their rear defense couldn't attend to everything, and there was a risk of losing ground. Jinan once had a lead of 12 to 4. Seeing the situation was not good, the Philippine community tried to rally. Zhang Liangxiong and others scored continuously, making it 13 to 10. Lin Dengru also scored one, and the score suddenly became 12 to 13. The Philippine community was only one point behind, with a great momentum to catch up. However, after a short stalemate, Yin Guiren made a quick shot in the middle of the court, which surprisingly went in. Han Zhenyuan added another point. In the first half, Jinan won against the Philippine community with a score of 17 to 12.</p>
<h3>No Improvement After Entering</h3>
<p>After the break, Jinan brought in rookies like Xu Yahui, and the team relaxed slightly. However, the Philippine community still showed no improvement. They made some contributions, but after 23 to 14, Xu Ze of the Philippine community and Zhang Liangxiong scored a goal each, adding four points, making it 18 to 23. This was the closest score in the second half. Later, Jinan advanced to 30 points. As time was about to run out, the Philippine community struggled to make a final counterattack. Jinan's Yin and Wang continued to play, and the situation suddenly became tense. In the end, Jinan won with a score of 34 to 25.</p>

Last year, the school won both the men's and women's championships in the City Elementary School Joint Sports Meet. As the City Elementary School Joint Sports Meet is about to open, the school held a small sports meet at the City No. 1 Sports Field yesterday to select representatives to attend.

<h3>A Famous Work in the Elementary School Sports Circle, "Guide to Elementary School Sports Meets," Published</h3>
<p>Recently, elementary school authorities have been paying attention to physical education due to the needs of the times and the environment. Therefore, elementary school sports meets are held enthusiastically everywhere.

<h3>The Chinese Wrestling Society and the Zhongyi Boxing Society Host a Banquet for National Games and National Examination Athletes</h3>
<p>More than ten members of the Shanghai Chinese Wrestling Society and the Zhongyi Boxing Society were selected to represent this city in various competitions at the National Games and the Second National Martial Arts Examination. Although they did not win any championships, they all received award points. After the National Examination closed on the 30th, the athletes returned to Shanghai on the 31st. The Chinese Wrestling Society specially sent representatives Yang Xiaowen, Ye Yushu, Weng Kangting, Wang Huaiting, Shi Tongsheng, Zhang Weichuan, Zhang Youchuan, etc., and the Zhongyi Boxing Society representatives Chen Fengming, Xu Yuechen, Pan Shaoyue, etc., to the station to welcome them. That evening, the two societies jointly hosted a wash-off banquet at the Jinlingchun Restaurant, with a total of thirty or forty people attending. During the banquet, Zhang Weichuan stood up to give a welcome speech, followed by President Tong Zhongyi's speech, which briefly stated that he had been serving as a judge for the National Examination for two decades, and the results of the two sessions were still good. However, during the competition, there were frequent disputes between the examinees and the referees. In terms of martial ethics and discipline, it was not as stable and compliant as the first session, mainly because the various competition rules were not prepared in advance. Afterwards, Mr. Ye Liang, a director of the Shanghai Martial Arts Museum, stood up to give a speech, which briefly stated that the inclusion of martial arts in this National Games was the first voice for martial arts to participate in sports, and the image obtained was quite good. However, in the conference, new and old sports were still not able to fully cooperate. During this trip to Beijing, the organization of the National Martial Arts Association was planned to be used for academic research on martial arts. Finally, member Zhu Wenwei stood up to report on his experience and feelings about attending the National Games. It was not until after 10 o'clock that they dispersed happily.</p>

<h3>Dissent on "New Theory of Teachers"</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhicun</p>
<p>A few days ago, after seeing the "Announcement of the Jue Lan Society" at the bottom of "Free Talk," I reread Mr. Wei Mengke's "Seeing the Jue Lan Society Painting Exhibition" and couldn't help but have some feelings. I thought that Mr. Wei Mengke's tone not only lost the proper state of a critic, but also inevitably seemed a bit like a frivolous youth in the modern intellectual class. But yesterday, after reading Mr. Yu Shixia's "New Theory of Teachers" in "Free Talk," I felt that this was exactly as Mr. Feng Zhiyu said in his article "Empty Trip," "In Chinese society, it is indeed a serious problem."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Shixia's article has three paragraphs in total. The first paragraph explains that "teachers" originally had no respectable qualities, so the traditional respect for teachers was actually the result of "monarch-teacherism." The second paragraph says that teachers often resent disciples for their superior skills, and conversely, disciples often resent teachers for their inferior skills. The third paragraph talks about Mr. Wei Mengke's matter. The author lightly forgives Mr. Wei Mengke's "disrespect for his teacher," on the grounds that it is "Mengke Mengjin"; and regarding the "Announcement of the Jue Lan Society," he comments: "It seems to have a hidden jealousy of his disciples." And the ending even has a strong flavor of encouraging Mr. Wei Mengke to thank his teacher.</p>
<p>Now let's first look at Mr. Wei Mengke's article. Mr. Wei believes that the paintings of the Jue Lan Society painters, who paint "red flowers and green leaves" as "green flowers and red leaves" and put fruits and mandolins next to large chimneys, are simply impossible to understand. Therefore, what he most praises is Liu Shi's painting of a worker. Although I am a layman in painting, I can clearly see the differences between the teachers and disciples. Looking at the Announcement of the Jue Lan Society, it clearly states "not intending to flaunt the qualifications of teachers and seniors...", but because Mr. Wei's text contains the phrase "The Jue Lan Society is a painting society organized by a group of young art students," they are deeply dissatisfied with Mr. Wei Mengke.</p>
<p>In such a simple fact, the gentlemen of the Jue Lan Society are not "fond of being teachers," and they do not resent talent or jealousy. As for "Mengke Mengjin" and "disrespectful words to his teacher," only a large part of Mr. Wei Mengke's article can be filled with it, and the phrase "The Jue Lan Society is a painting society organized by a group of young art students" cannot be included.</p>
<p>"Han Yu said that there is no Confucius in the world, so he should not be in the ranks of disciples." I believe this is indeed true, but Han Yu is "not born knowing things," doesn't he have a teacher who enlightened him and taught him to read? I believe that art schools, although called specialized, are actually artistic enlightenment education. Mr. Wei Mengke must have started with pencil and charcoal drawing at the art school, so the gentlemen of the Jue Lan Society can be said to be Mr. Wei's enlightenment teachers. In the future, Mr. Wei's paintings may (or already are) surpass his teacher's paintings, but he cannot object to the pencil and charcoal drawing he practiced at the art school.</p>
<p>We can thank the professors at the university for their different thoughts and theories, but we can never deny the teachers of primary and secondary schools because our knowledge has increased. Mr. Wei Mengke can criticize the paintings of the gentlemen of the Jue Lan Society as being bad, but he cannot say "The Jue Lan Society is a painting society organized by a group of young art students." Now that Mr. Wei Mengke has said this, I think this is Mr. Wei exposing his own "frivolity." Mr. Yu Shixia does not recognize the facts, but instead speaks up for Mr. Wei, asking him to "thank his teacher," and does not know that the examples of Zhang Taiyan and Zhou Zuoren do not apply to Wei Mengke. I believe that this will give many frivolous youths an excuse to despise their enlightenment teachers, which is a serious problem in society.</p>
<h3>Staring</h3>
<p>— He Jiahua</p>
<p>After the Taoist ceremony was completed, it was time to burn the silver ingots.</p>
<p>At that time, the snow stopped, but the wind was blowing even harder, that terrible whistling!</p>
<p>We gathered in a wasteland that had been abandoned for a long time, desolate and silent. Everywhere was decaying dead grass. When you stepped on it, your shoes were full of mud, cold and icy. Although it had been snowing for several days, it was impossible to accumulate in this muddy place. So, if you don't look at the snowy scenery around you and just walk on this wasteland, then all you can feel is the mood of a rainy day.</p>
<p>The stream flowed very slowly, and snow blocks kept rolling down from the mountains, blocking the flow of the stream. That dull, melancholy sound made people sadly recall the gentle and lively babbling under the spring sunshine.</p>
<p>The village was silent, no sound could be heard anywhere. The mountains were black and towering, as if swaying with the black clouds.</p>
<p>Sparks flew, and the flames stretched out in all directions. The silver ingots were about to burn out.</p>
<p>There were about a dozen of us, all dressed in plain white clothes and hats, tied with coarse hemp ropes, wearing straw sandals, desolate and silent. Sometimes everyone circled around the fire, and sometimes they dispersed, scattering white rice placed in aprons or pockets, making circles, turning around and around, shivering in the cold wind, shouting, and chanting mantras. Su Xian was running in front of me, she often turned her head to peek, but I scattered rice on her face and skirt. If it weren't for burning silver ingots, or if the person who died wasn't my grandmother, we, this pair of naughty children, might have embraced tightly in the cold at a time when everyone felt miserable.</p>
<p>But look at my poor grandfather!</p>
<p>He was hunchbacked. Holding a bamboo stick in his hand, he turned the silver ingots, making them burn faster. While turning, he muttered to the fire:</p>
<p>"Take this little bit with you, old one, you can't be short on the road!"</p>
<p>After a while, he said again:</p>
<p>"Be a little bolder, no one will rob you, your children and grandchildren are all by your side."</p>
<p>He stared ahead, his mind focused, his dim eyes seemed to glow. He watched those pages of silver paper flying in the firelight, motionless, holding his breath, as if his soul had left his body. He seemed to see his old wife, who had lived with him for more than twenty years, standing in front of him, slowly counting the silver, and taking away her capital to go to the underworld.</p>
<p>"Take it all with you, you have worked hard all your life, and now you must take a little more with you."</p>
<p>He coughed, his whole body shaking, the cold wind clearly blowing his bones apart. But he still stared at the fire, absentmindedly, as if in this deep gaze, he saw white hair, wrinkles, and a body bent by life. It was as if she was coughing, low and hoarse. He was used to that sound, every evening and every morning in these more than twenty years of shared hardship.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly, he knelt down. He stretched out his hand, as if grabbing something, constantly gesturing. The silver ingots had already burned out, the fire gradually extinguished, and the half-burned foil flew with the wind. His eyes were fixed on a larger piece of silver paper, as if it were the soul of his grandmother. Wherever that piece of silver paper flew, his eyes followed. We persuaded him to go home, but he couldn't hear, he just stared blankly in the direction where the silver paper flew.</p>
<p>"Walk slowly, old one, I will be leaving soon too, wait for me there?"</p>
<p>He looked at it motionless, but besides the snow, the cold wind, and the burned ash heap, all he saw was the emptiness of a lifetime...</p>
<h3>Traveling in the Buddhist Country</h3>
<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>丨Travel Notes 1</p>
<p>I spent less than a week traveling all over Mount Putuo, which is known as the Buddhist country. I asked myself what I had gained, but I couldn't answer myself.</p>
<p>I am not a fetishist, nor a hermit, nor any kind of high-ranking official. I accompanied a few friends to Putuo, just wanting to spend a little of my dull time in friendship. So in the few days of my stay, I never stopped walking all day long, and I only slowly walked back to the temple where I was staying when my body was tired and my toes were aching. My friends were the same as me.</p>
<p>Every morning as soon as it dawned, we got up. In front of the window stood a high mountain in the distance. Some trees grew sparsely on it. This mountain seemed a bit steep, but it didn't block the sunlight from us. Instead, seeing the sunlight shining so brightly on it, we felt lively, light, and happy. The environment was very quiet, and the not-very-noisy chirping of the birds broke through the quiet air of the summer morning.</p>
<p>After breakfast, the six of us put on hemp shoes, took a towel around our necks, and set off on a new route. A friend took the map, and he became a guide. Other friends brought cameras. As for me, I was only prepared to follow everyone blindly, climbing mountains was originally what I liked the most.</p>
<p>None of us had been to Putuo, this was the first time. The map naturally wouldn't be accurate, because Chinese people basically don't pay attention to the word "accurate." Maps often cause people to take the wrong road. We had also had this experience. But this time we didn't feel any difficulty. The road was not difficult to recognize, and there were often signposts to a certain temple or monastery to offer incense along the road.</p>
<p>There were no women on the road, friend T's mother and wife went to worship Buddha in sedan chairs separately. Naturally, everyone walked very fast. After spending half a day, we happily finished touring the front mountain, took a photo of the Two Turtles Listening to the Dharma, and even took a nap on the Pan Tuo Rock. In the afternoon, the weather became even hotter. Walking in the sun was a bit uncomfortable, and our feet also felt tired, so we returned to the temple to eat. There were many sedan chair carriers soliciting business from us along the road. There were indeed many sedan chair passengers, but each of us had two feet, and we had not suffered from paralysis, so of course we could only let our feet carry our bodies back.</p>
<p>After waking up from an afternoon nap in the temple, it was about three or four o'clock. We made an appointment to go out together again, to go to the beach to swim, or to climb the rocks to catch animals. There was a tent selling coffee there, so we deposited our coats and shoes there. When we were tired of playing on the beach, we went back there to drink soda.</p>
<p>The next day we toured the back mountain. The schedule was about the same as the day before, except for one less person, T, who accompanied his mother on a boat to Mount Luojia to worship Buddha. That friend was a scientist and a very innocent person. The first time he met a monk, he strongly refuted the Buddhist principles and almost quarreled with the monk. But in order to fulfill his mother's long-cherished wish, he had to sacrifice a little joy of touring the back mountain this time and go to Mount Luojia, which was full of smoke and pilgrims. There were no temples on that mountain, only some thatched sheds. He stood outside the thatched shed for most of the day, watching his mother burn incense and kowtow inside. This time we toured the Brahma Sound Cave, and like yesterday's tour of the Tide Sound Cave, all we got was disappointment. On that map, it was printed with "Putuo Scenic Spots Must See," and people had described the Tide Sound Cave and Brahma Sound Cave as very magical places. It is said that many devout fetishists would "be dazzled and deafened, and their souls would be lost" when they arrived there, and even "throw themselves off the cliff and break their bodies, seeking to be reborn in the Pure Land." But when we went there, we only saw some broken houses and old caves, and there were no strange or violent scenes. Some steep rocks towered by the sea. When the wind blew, the sea roared and kept hitting the rocks, sometimes hitting into the caves, so water splashed on the rocks. It was a bit interesting for people to lean on the railings and look down. But such a scene can also be seen on other beaches. Our disappointment was not without reason.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (16)</h3>
<p>— Authored by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>After Pierre left the house, he walked towards Rue de Paris. This street was brightly lit, bustling with activity, and filled with the clamor of voices, making it the main thoroughfare of Le Havre. The cool, sea air gently brushed his face. He walked slowly, his cane hanging from his arm, hands clasped behind his back. He felt unwell, his steps heavy, as if he had received some bad news, and discontent filled his heart. No clear thought troubled him, and at first, he couldn’t explain the source of this physical and mental discomfort. He felt something was wrong somewhere, but he didn't know exactly where: he had a small ache, a nearly imperceptible wound. People couldn't find the location of this wound, yet it made him feel embarrassed, tired, sad, and annoyed. It was an unfamiliar, slight pain, something like a seed of sorrow.</p>
<p>As he walked to the square in front of the theater, he felt drawn to the lights of Tortoni's Café, so he slowly walked towards the bright storefront. But as he was about to go inside, he thought he would encounter some friends, some acquaintances, people he would have to talk to. Suddenly, he felt a disgust for this ordinary camaraderie over small tea cups and wine glasses. He turned around and walked back onto the main road that led him to the docks.</p>
<p>He thought, "Where am I going?" all the while searching for a place he would enjoy, a place that would lift his spirits. But he couldn't find such a place because he was both angry at himself for ending up alone and unwilling to meet anyone.</p>
<p>When he reached the large dock, he hesitated once more, then turned and walked towards the embankment: he chose solitude.</p>
<p>He stumbled upon a wooden bench on the breakwater and sat down. He was already too lazy to walk any further; he felt weary even before he had begun his stroll.</p>
<p>He thought, "What's wrong with me tonight?" He searched his memories for the source of his discontent, as if questioning a patient about the cause of a fever.</p>
<p>He possessed a temperament that was easily stimulated yet also capable of deep reflection. He thought passionately, then rationally investigated, approving or condemning his excitement: but his nature was ultimately stronger than reason; the sentient being always suppressed the rational one.</p>
<p>He was now pondering the origins of his languor, his mind needing to be moved yet not wanting anything, his desire to meet people whose opinions would differ from his own, and his disgust for the people he might encounter and the things they might say to him.</p>
<p>He posed the question to himself: "Is it because Zhean received the inheritance?"</p>
<p>Yes, that's definitely possible. When the notary announced the news, he felt his heart beat a little faster than usual. Indeed, sometimes we can't control ourselves; we are subject to natural and stubborn impulses that we can't resist.</p>
<p>He began to deeply reflect on this physiological issue: the impression made by a certain fact on the instinctive being, which simultaneously left within him many painful or joyful thoughts and feelings. These thoughts and feelings were contrary to the good and pure thoughts and feelings desired, advocated, and judged by the thoughtful being, whose intellect had become superior to itself through education.</p>
<p>He strived to understand the psychology of a son who had received a large inheritance, a son who, because of this inheritance, could now pursue the pleasures he had long desired but had been restrained from by his father's miserliness. This father was both loved and resented by his son.</p>

<h3>Finance: Spot Silver Rebounds, Bullion Plunges by 9.7 Yuan; Lacks Sustained Momentum, Breaking Below the 60 Yuan Mark Twice</h3>
<p>The gold market lacked strong momentum yesterday and seemed unable to recover. The situation remained sluggish throughout the morning, with market conditions relatively flat. Initially, overseas silver markets saw English prices flatten and American prices contract. The forward silver price on the Gold Exchange rose by 4.5 to 5%. Exchange rates opened lower but recovered later. London spot gold fell by 7.5 pence. The official U.S. gold price was set at $32.12, up 16 cents from the previous day. U.S. wheat fell by 2.5 cents, stocks declined slightly, and U.S. cotton saw only minor fluctuations. Public sentiment remained uncertain. Off-market trading opened at 70 yuan, gradually declining. After the market opened, with bank support, the market was relatively flat. However, when HSBC quoted the English exchange rate up 1.25 and the U.S. exchange rate up 6.25, both the exchange rate market and the gold market succumbed to pressure. Banks took advantage of the low prices to increase their holdings, causing the price to struggle around the 60 yuan mark. The situation was quite weak. Subsequently, Reuters reported that President Roosevelt expected assurance from the British side that his actions in the European market were not intended to provoke a retaliatory plan or ignite a destructive competition that would depreciate currencies. The British government, in a spirit of friendship, stated that the U.S. President's policy regarding raising gold prices and stabilizing the U.S. dollar abroad was purely a domestic policy of the United States. Public sentiment improved slightly, and the price gradually stabilized above 60 yuan. The hammer price was 1,115 yuan. The morning's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The market opened at 766 yuan, down 8 yuan from the previous close. Spot goods opened at 5.7 yuan. Exchange rates opened with recent selling prices of 1 shilling 3.5 pence for the British exchange rate and 31.125 yuan for the U.S. exchange rate. Spot goods supply conditions: The market immediately retreated to 4 yuan. Banque Franco-Chinoise bought U.S. dollars for February delivery at 8.125. Heng Yu, Yuan Sheng, Yong Feng, and Da Yongjin reached 6.3 yuan. Zheng Chang, Ri Chang, and Da De Cheng sold at 3.7 yuan. Banque Franco-Chinoise bought U.S. dollars for February delivery at 8.75. Heng Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, and others continued to purchase, returning to 5.7 yuan. Wu Si Da Xing Yong continued to sell repeatedly. Qing Fa, Yong Heng Yu, and others also sold. It was anticipated that HSBC would quote the English rate up 1.25 and the U.S. rate up 6.25. U.S. dollars for March delivery at 0.0625 were difficult to sell and fell to 60 yuan. HSBC bought U.S. dollars for March delivery at 1.25. Yi Da Yong purchased, rising to 2.8 yuan. Qian Chang Xiang and Da Xing Yong vigorously sold, falling another 2 yuan. Zheng Jin purchased U.S. dollars for February delivery at 9.375. Zhejiang bought January delivery at 75. Qian Chang Xiang, Heng Yu advanced, returning to 3.3 yuan. After entering the market, the situation was uncertain. Internal trading hardened. Heng Yu, Rui Kang, Fu Yu, Bing Xing sold off, breaking the 60 yuan mark and retreating to 59.5 yuan. Qian Chang Xiang, Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Tai, Zhi Feng, Yong Tong Feng, Heng Yuan Mao Yong, and others purchased together. Banks supported U.S. dollars for March delivery at 1.875, gradually rebounding to 62.3 yuan. Fu Yu, Heng Yu, and others sold again. Public sentiment was weak, and rumors were unfavorable. Bank appetite was slightly sluggish, and the price fell to 59.2 yuan. Qian Chang Xiang, Bing Xing bought spot goods. Zheng Jin bought U.S. dollars for February delivery at 32 yuan. The situation recovered. There was news from foreign wire services of stabilizing the U.S. dollar. Yuan Mao Yong, Yi Da Yong, Heng Xing Yuan, and others entered the market and rose to 64.5 yuan. Hong Kong sold U.S. dollars electronically. Da Fa Yong and Yuan Feng Yong sold, retreating to 2 yuan. Da Lian gang bought spot goods. The price continued to rise. Fu Yu, Da De Cheng, and others advanced to 4.8 yuan. The afternoon close was 764.3 yuan, and the spot goods auction was at 5 yuan. After the market closed, the price stabilized and returned to flat. The highest price during the morning was 766.3 yuan, and the lowest was 759.2 yuan, with a difference of 7.1 yuan. The result was a drop of 9.7 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price, due to HSBC's U.S. exchange rate listing increasing by 6.25, was 30.75 yuan, equivalent to a bullion price of 780 yuan, approximately 16 yuan above the closing price, about 6 yuan less than the previous closing price. The registered price for this month was 772 yuan, and the registered price for December was 764 yuan. The morning margin call was 772 yuan. The hammer price was 1,125 yuan. Trading in the market remained low, with Tong Feng Yong selling only two hundred taels to Tianjin Gang for 1,128 yuan. After that, Tong Feng Yong and others continued to offer supply, and the price subsequently declined, eventually settling around 1,124-5 yuan, but without any transactions. There were 1,323 notes remaining for this month. Trading in the market was mediocre. Overall, Wan Xing, Shun Li, Heng Yu, Heng Tai, Ying Feng, Heng Tong Feng, Heng Yong Feng, Yi Da Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Fu Chang, Heng Xing Yuan, and others were on the buying side. Rui Kang, Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Heng, Rui Xing, Da Chang Xiang, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Xing, Yong Chang Sheng, Yong Yi Feng, Yong Tong Chun, Da Xing Yong, and Da Kang were on the selling side. Bing Xing, Da De Cheng, Yuan Sheng Yong, Qing Fa Yong, and others first sold and then bought. Da Lian Gang and Wan Xing jointly traded over 3,500 notes, netting about 900. Shun Li jointly traded a little less than 2,500 notes, netting over 500. The Guangdong gang, Heng Xing, traded little in and out, slightly selling after netting. A total of 23,856 December codes were traded.</p>
<h3>Bank Appetite Slows; Fluctuations in English and American Exchange Rates; HSBC Lists English Rate Up 1.25, U.S. Rate Up 6.25</h3>
<p>According to foreign wire services yesterday, London rates for both spot and forward remained unchanged. U.S. silver fell by 25, while forward silver rose by 4.5%.

London spot gold fell by 7.5 pence. Private silver rates rose by 0.375. Exchange rates rose by 0.0425. The exchange rate market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of 1 shilling 3.5 pence for the English rate and 31.125 yuan for the U.S. rate, which was 0.0625 harder for English rates and 0.25 harder for U.S. rates compared to the previous close. Trading was flat at the open, due to bank support. Subsequently, due to HSBC's rate announcement of English rates up 1.25 and U.S. rates up 6.25, the process loosened, and bank appetite slowed, leading to a hardening of the market. Finally, with Reuters reporting news of stabilizing the U.S. dollar, banks took advantage of the low prices and slightly stabilized the market. By the afternoon close, recent selling prices were 1 shilling 3.15 pence for English rates and 31.3125 yuan for U.S. rates, which was 0.0625 looser for English rates and 0.4375 harder for U.S. rates compared to the previous close. In February, 536 francs were bought by McCallie. Banks including HSBC, Shanghai Zheng Jin, and Banque Franco-Chinoise were buyers.

<h3>Rumors Resurface; Bond Market Returns to Sluggishness - Market Prices Change Easily with Any Change in the Environment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the market was initially quite stable, but rumors spread again, and the market price declined again. During periods of high trading volume between buyers and sellers, rumors can easily cause disturbances. Currently, the trend has entered a phase where supply and demand are balanced. If either side gains new strength, the other side will likely panic. Any change in the environment can easily cause major disruptions. It is expected that the market's prospects for this month will be turbulent and difficult to stabilize. At the opening yesterday morning, Reorganization of Troops bonds were slightly up by 0.1-0.2 yuan, while the rest gradually declined. At the beginning of the auction for Salt Tax bonds, the price was still slightly down, but due to more buyers, it gradually increased. Some people maintained the price. In the secondary market, sentiment did not improve, and the market price was slightly weak but still stable. Trading was not particularly active. In the afternoon, rumors spread, and sellers rushed to the market. The market prices of No. 4 and No. 41 bonds plummeted by 0.5-0.6 yuan. The closing situation was unsettled, and No. 4 and No. 50 bonds continued to be sold. The forward price of 1928 bonds plummeted by 0.7 yuan, while the rest fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan. Only the unified Salt Tax bond was relatively stable. In general, market prices are easily affected by rumors at this time, and both sides should be cautious. As a result, prices fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan to over 1 yuan. The Reorganization of Troops and 1928 bonds saw the biggest declines. The total trading volume was 12,506,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot transactions. Term sales of unified Salt Tax bonds totaled 4.99 million, 1928 Customs bonds totaled 1.5 million, 20-volume 20-tax bonds totaled 2.685 million, and Reorganization of Troops bonds reached 2.015 million, while the rest ranged from tens of thousands to just over 200,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Declines Slightly</h3>
<p>The New Feng foreign firm reported that on the 31st, the New York stock market declined slightly. The future trend is uncertain, as many are waiting to see what the government's monetary policy will be. This correction seems to have come to an end. It is advisable to buy at these low prices. The wheat market was dull due to a lack of trading news. Buyers were scarce, and wheat prices fell slightly, making it still advantageous to buy. The cotton market was firm due to factory purchases. Rumors circulated about a possible agreement between the U.S. and England on gold, and the U.S. President's unused inflationary powers remain a potential force in the cotton market. However, there are few ordinary buyers, waiting for the government's cotton production report on November 8. The closing price of silver was stable due to rumors that the government may purchase new silver produced domestically. The price of gold at the Financial Readjustment Agency was 32.12 yuan per tael, up 0.16 yuan. The Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 88.16 Down 0.27</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 35.94 Down 0.15</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 23.08 Down 0.28</p>

<h3>Yarn Market in a Dilemma Between Bulls and Bears</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and quite stagnant. Due to the deteriorating environment, most people are pessimistic. However, since the establishment of a certain association, efforts have been made to stabilize market prices. When the yarn market falls, the association absorbs as much as possible, putting the market in a dilemma between bulls and bears. Therefore, trading is quite slow. Many open positions are auctioned off.</p>
<h3>Human Marks Stalled</h3>
<p>At the opening of the futures market for Human Marks yarn, the market was quite sluggish due to mixed movements in U.S. cotton prices. Trading volume decreased significantly. Prices for various months declined slightly by 0.1-0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, there were reports of good sales of spot yarn, with over 2,000 bales sold, including the previous day's sales. The market was particularly bullish, with prices for various months rising by 0.1-0.4 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 6,800 bales. Selling volume: Da Ji 300 bales, Zhen Da 250 bales, Shen Ji 200 bales, Chang Feng 850 bales, Sen Kang 300 bales.

<p>Ningbo 35 Guangdong 235 Mainland 190 Jiangxi 15 Same Trade 10</p>
<p>Northern Gang 5 Sichuan 1,535 Shantou 30 Nanjing 12</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Without Major Gains or Losses - Special Margin of 3 Yuan Per Dan Added for November Futures Starting from the 1st</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable and unchanged. However, with mixed movements in U.S. cotton prices and falling gold prices, the local cotton market should have a downward trend. However, sources from various regions have not been particularly active. Buyers are organized. Another theory is that Japanese merchants are buying and exporting in bulk, with tens of thousands of dan exported in October. Therefore, the bulls are talking about buying, but have remained still throughout. The cotton market has become neither dead nor alive.</p>
<h3>Zheng Marks Quiet</h3>
<p>At the opening of the futures market for Zheng Marks cotton, the market was still tight, but it softened during the second and third rounds of trading. Prices for nearby months rose by 0.1 yuan, while prices for distant months fell by 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, prices for various months rose by 0.05-0.1 yuan.

<p>Shaanxi Cotton 40.50 Shanghai Factory Purchase 500 Pieces Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Donggou Cotton 38.50 Shen Xin Factory Purchase 1,000 Bales Sent to Factory</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Grading Table of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange</h3>

<h3>Tianjin Cotton Yarn Flat, Flower Market Active</h3>

Mei Ji company bought 130 bales at an opening price of 40.08 yuan. Other foreign merchants bought 60 bales at an opening price of 41 yuan and another 200 bales at 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Futures Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market initially fell due to poor spot demand and reduced buying interest. Later, it rebounded on buying by fellow traders. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 points, nearby futures rose by 1 to 3 points, while deferred futures fell by 3 to 4 points. Liverpool spot cotton fell by 4 points, nearby futures rose by 1 point, and deferred futures fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton fell by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market was firm due to short covering. As a result, Pingar fell by 2 rupees, Omra fell by 1.5 rupees, and Broach fell by 1 rupee. (Reported on October 31st)</p>

<h3>Imported Wheat Sets the Tone, Flour and Wheat Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>After the opening of both the morning and afternoon sessions, flour market prices showed a consistent downward trend across all months. With imported wheat quotations from Chicago falling by around 57 cents and those from Canada falling by around 1 cent, the market outlook deteriorated after the opening. The most significant factor was the substantial easing of foreign exchange rates and the instability in the gold market. As a result, spot imported wheat prices were considered reasonable. Rumors circulated that Argentine wheat was being discounted from $4.28 to $4.25, and Australian wheat also fell to $4.32 (reportedly a certain factory fixed 6,000 tons). Consequently, selling pressure intensified, and the market declined in tandem. During the afternoon session, major factories continued to aggressively sell deferred contracts, and speculative traders also withdrew in large numbers, leading to a gradual and sharp decline in the market. Despite the global price declines, the local market could not avoid being affected. The current month saw only a slight drop due to outside support, with the current month falling by 2.5 cents from the end of the previous month, December falling by 3.75 cents, January falling by 5.5 cents, February falling by 4.75 cents, March falling by 6 cents, and April initially opening at 2.05 cents but closing down by 3.25 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat market prices saw a sharp decline across all months during both the morning and afternoon sessions. The severity of this decline was rare in recent times. Although imported wheat quotations only fell by around 57 cents in Chicago, this alone could not account for the sharp drop. The main reason for the decline was the excessive easing of foreign exchange rates and the availability of spot wheat for fixed contracts. It was rumored that a certain factory had already concluded two shipments, one each of Argentine and Australian wheat. Once this news spread, market sentiment became extremely weak, especially for deferred contracts. Both the morning and afternoon sessions seemed entirely dominated by sellers. November fell by 9 cents from the end of the previous month, December fell by 13 cents, January fell by 14 cents, February fell by 15 cents, March fell by 16 cents, and April initially opened at $4.04 but closed down by 7 cents. The spot wheat market was generally stable, with Kaiheqiao wheat at $3.64 and Shashi wheat at $3.50, totaling 2,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Soochow Tung Non-glutinous Rice Recovers by More Than a Dime</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) There were over thirty sources with over three thousand piculs of goods. The market activity was similar to yesterday, but due to less arrival and overcast weather, market sentiment stabilized slightly. Therefore, the price of Soochow Tung non-glutinous rice and ordinary non-glutinous rice recovered by more than a dime. Duyang pointed rice remained flat. The market for other varieties such as Qingjiao and thick grain rice was stable due to larger quantities. There were still about one thousand bags of Yaozhong No. 6 in stock, but prices were unaffected due to stricter demand from Hakka buyers. Broken non-glutinous rice was scarce and in demand, with slightly increased sales for Xin Yin Yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Forty-eight to forty-nine ships arrived from various routes downstream. Trading in all commodities on the market was strong. The market for new non-glutinous rice, Yangdu, Bugu pointed rice, both new and old varieties of Bian Yuan thin rice, all showed an upward trend. However, the price of Bai Yin Yuan fell by 10 to 20 cents.</p>
<h3>Indica Rice Sales Stagnate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of Indica rice to out-of-town buyers were unusually sluggish, with no transactions for an entire day. This was due to the current harvest of late rice in various regions. Even in the sales areas, there were limited local supplies entering the market. Guangdong Province was directly arranging shipments, and Fujian Province was also inquiring about supplies from the Yangtze River region. Fujian Province continued to arrange a large number of shipments, and local inventories were increasing, sufficient for two months of sales. As Shanghai has ample reserves, they took this opportunity to halt all purchases and wait for market prices to decline before inquiring again. There was some local demand downstream and inland, and Zhejiang Province was purchasing from nearby areas. Therefore, there were no transactions for an entire day. There was some disturbance in the market a few days ago due to Japanese merchants repatriating small bills. After the rice was subsidized and the contract canceled, the turmoil subsided. However, recently, non-commercial sources have spread rumors that the rice was being shipped to Shantou for sale. In reality, the local government is levying an import tax of $1.50 per picul, and local rice merchants are opposing the shipment, so there cannot be any large-scale imports. As for Shanghai's inventory of foreign rice, there have been no inquiries from local buyers, and the market is still expecting a decline. Yesterday, 100 bags of small bills were sold on this street at a price of $7.30, which was 5 cents lower than the previous week.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Cost of Living Index for October of the 22nd Year</h3>
<p>The National Tariff Commission recently released a brief report on the Shanghai cost of living index, stating that the index for October of the 22nd year compiled by the commission was 106.9, which was 0.8% higher than the previous month and 5.8% lower than the same month last year. The index for each category is listed below for comparison (with 1926 as 100%).</p>
<p>Year October of the 22nd Year September of the 22nd Year October of the 21st Year</p>

<p>Total Index 106.9 106.6 113.5</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Factory Refined White Sugar Drops Another Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weaker due to a slight decrease in customs gold units. The association's base price for No. 24 raw sugar, white, and ordinary goods fell another 5 cents to $20.95. No transaction was made for No. 20 medium sugar, white. Dutch Red BDA mark fell by 5 cents to $16.05. NT mark was priced at $16.20. The base price of factory refined white sugar continued to decline without any signs of recovery. Yesterday, the market dropped another dime. China, Guohua, and Zhenji No. 1 white sugar were all at $19.70, No. 2 at 50 cents, No. 3 at 30 cents, and No. 4 at 10 cents. China's top grade was $19.90. Zhenji No. 5 was $18.90. Chao gang members offered Zhuang Qing Kai at $15.85 and Long Gang Qing at $14.50, with a total transaction volume of over a hundred bags. Hong Kong gang members offered several hundred bags of thick red rock sugar Qing, with the higher ones at $16.40 and the lower ones at $16.30.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil Enters a Downturn Again</h3>
<p>Soybean oil once rose due to the rebound in continuous electricity, and the market atmosphere suddenly improved. A ship of domestic buyers took advantage of the situation to actively purchase, but actual sales remained sluggish. Moreover, continuous electricity declined again, causing the sharp rise to dissipate within a few days. Yesterday, 700 cases of various oils opened at a price of a dime and a half lower.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Foreign Factories' Silk Sales Increasingly Stagnant</h3>
<p>(London Raw Silk Prices Plummet) The London raw silk market has recently been affected by the low-price dumping of Japanese silk, resulting in a sharp drop in the market price per pound in shillings. In mid-month, Grade A white dry silk was priced at 8 shillings per pound, equivalent to about $754 in Chinese currency per bale. Grade B was 7 shillings 6 pence, equivalent to about $702. Yesterday, Shanghai factories received a telegram from London stating that Grade A dry silk was only priced at 7 shillings 6 pence per pound, equivalent to $690 in Chinese currency. Grade B was 7 shillings, equivalent to $639. Each pound fell by 6 pence, and each bale fell by about 60 to 70 yuan in Chinese currency. Therefore, it is even more difficult for European sales of Chefoo silk to recover.</p>
<p>(European and American Silk Sales Increasingly Difficult to Recover) Exchange rates in Europe and America continue to fluctuate drastically. Overseas silk inventories are abundant, silk fabrics are sluggish, and weaving factories are increasingly hesitant to purchase futures and spot silk. With no improvement in silk telegrams, European and American factories in Shanghai have also ceased operations and are quietly waiting for opportunities. Chinese silk merchants are also very passive, the market atmosphere is sluggish, and silk sales are even more difficult to recover. There have been no transactions of spot silk.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<h3>U.S. Tinplate Supply Cannot Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Although U.S. tinplate has recently arrived overseas in succession, the quantity is small, and the market still faces a supply shortage. Currently, the market price for 90-pound tinplate is $16.70 (with iron casing) and $16.40 (without iron casing), while 100-pound tinplate is $18.20 (with iron casing) and $18.00 (without iron casing), all up by 10 to 20 cents. The price for double-linked tinplate, which is 90 pounds (i.e., 180 pounds) is $33.50, and 100 pounds (i.e., 200 pounds) is $36.50. The transaction volume is very high with canneries, and cigarette companies and biscuit companies are also purchasing in large quantities. Daily transaction volume is generally in the range of six to seven hundred boxes. The future market outlook is optimistic.</p>
<h3>Chimney Iron Sheet Price Increases by 20 Cents</h3>
<p>The business of 18-sheet chimney iron sheets has been booming in the northern areas recently, and the price has increased by 20 cents. Each picul costs $12. However, based on the current exchange rate, the cost is about $12.30 to $12.40 per picul. Therefore, market sentiment is very optimistic, and there is a high possibility of further price increases.</p>

<h3>Full of Ancient Air</h3>
<p>— Xian Xian</p>
<p>The bayonet charge of the Big Sword Squad, we always feel a bit ancient, almost suspecting that we are dreaming of the eighteenth century, but unexpectedly, these days we feel that everything in the current social situation is "full of ancient air," and it is everywhere.</p>
<p>The most ancient of these must be the "floods along the Yellow River." People watched the water in the Yellow River rising inch by inch, all anxious and wide-eyed, jumping up and down, which is clearly the scene of the Three Dynasties when Dayu had not yet started to control the floods.</p>
<p>Bandits everywhere occupy the mountain peaks and lakes, recruit soldiers and buy horses, accumulate grass and store grain, and fight with government troops. And these vagrant bandits often start with dozens of people and gather more and more people. Later, several groups merge into one, actually copying the old stories of Liangshan Marsh.</p>
<p>It's either the independence of Manchuria, or the autonomy of Mongolia, Tibetan soldiers invade, and then comes a massacre of Han people by the Hui. Many of the ancient barbarian invasions are exactly the same as the current situation, but now there are no Luo Tong, Xue Rengui, or the Yang family.</p>
<p>Hankou, it is said that a new batch of "Butterfly Gang" has appeared. Although they rape elementary school girls and then sell the girls for money, which is somewhat different from the ancient flower-picking thieves who killed their victims after raping them, even if Bao Gong were reborn, Peng Gong would have to ask the Five Tigers and Seven Heroes to handle the case.</p>
<p>As for elementary school students abandoning their homes to become monks on Mount Emei, it is naturally not a thought that would arise in this century.</p>
<p>Living in this society full of ancient air, one would really suspect that one is dreaming of the twentieth century, rather than being a person of the twentieth century. But airplanes, cannons, and all the products of science are constantly flashing before our eyes. What's going on? Well, in the eyes of us remnants of an ancient country, these are just like the people of scientifically advanced countries watching the "World 50 Years Later" film, with no difference.</p>
<h3>Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Shen Shou Ruo</p>
<p>I often savor the story of Zhuangzi and Huizi observing fish on the Hao River, and I feel that it contains a philosophy of happiness. Therefore, my envy for the fish also arises spontaneously. However, I have no hope of reaching the old place where Zhuangzi went, the Hao River, in this lifetime. Therefore, I often think of narrowing the scope and raising a few goldfish to play with, to comfort my work boredom and occasional free time!</p>
<p>Just when I couldn't get the fish I wanted, a relative happened to bring a lot of goldfish from Shanghai, and he gave me a few. I was extremely happy, and immediately prepared a large tank of clear water and put the goldfish in. Because they had been trapped in the aquarium for a long journey, once they entered the tank, it seemed that the water kingdom suddenly felt vast, and they were leisurely and happy. So I performed the cornerstone laying ceremony of paradise.</p>
<p>It is said that Guan Zhong in mankind has the ability to enrich the country and strengthen the people. Guan Zhong in the grass also has the ability to ward off epidemics and drive away evil. Of course, I have no power to govern the country, so I have to rely on ordinary adults and gentlemen. So, the water kingdom in my family, that is, my Hao River, this responsibility of ruling, no matter how incapable I am, I cannot shirk it.</p>
<p>People who have raised goldfish have told me their experiences: there are also epidemics in the water kingdom, and fish are most easily infected with mold. Probably because the water quality is not clean. If you buy a Guan Zhong from the pharmacy and put it in the tank, you may be able to avoid it. After I did as I was told, the results were good, and the goldfish's health has been maintained to this day. This ruler of my water kingdom seems to have more face than those who govern the country, and I can't help but reveal a smug look.</p>
<p>Every morning, I always have to go to my Hao River to observe the fish. I see them wearing beautiful clothes, circling in the water, showing off. When they meet the opposite sex, they chase each other closely, unwilling to let go. Sometimes they float up and down, showing off their swimming skills, shaking their heads and wagging their tails with a very smug expression. Sometimes they fight for food, with no room for concession. Everything about them is actually in line with the modern times!</p>
<p>"It is the joy of the fish," the philosophy of happiness observed by Lu is like this, and I have learned a lot.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Haikjingbo Circus</h3>
<p>— Kun Yuan</p>
<p>I used to see the animal film "Tiger Roar Lion Roar" in the cinema, which made people marvel. It turned out that a German circus had twenty-six fierce tigers and twenty-five lions, all extremely fierce. There was a man named "Jack" who could train lions and tigers to perform, which was extremely dangerous. When the curtain opened, the lions and tigers all came out of the iron cages, and he made them sit on chairs one by one. Although some bared their teeth and claws, and their roars were like bronze gongs, stubbornly refusing to obey Jack's commands, Jack eventually used an iron chair in one hand and an electric whip in the other to direct them onto the chairs, each as docile as a lamb. Jack could also make the tigers roll around on the field, left and right, front and back. If we were to train a raccoon, I'm afraid we couldn't do that. The novel says how Wu Song beat the tiger on Jingyang Ridge, which is already admired to the point of prostration. Who knew that this foreign Wu Song was truly a figure among immortals, wasn't he a subduing tiger immortal? Now that the "Haikjingbo Circus" has newly arrived in Shanghai, and it also has this ability, it will naturally cause a sensation throughout the city.</p>
<p>In the Haikjingbo Circus, the scene of the fierce tigress jumping through the fire hoop is enough to frighten anyone who sees it. Now, she is asked to jump through the fire hoop, and she willingly jumps. This is not only a strange thing, but it is also enough to make friends in the audience who have long been oppressed by the power of the tigress express endless sighs! It is said that Haikjingbo was originally a German nobleman with a very wealthy family. His father liked hunting, and over time, the rare birds and beasts in his home became countless. Of course, his home became a large-scale zoo. In his spare time, he would train and play with these animals, and soon he succeeded in creating a rudimentary circus, but it was just playing around in a noble family. One day, he was training a tiger and put his own head into the tiger's mouth. Unfortunately, the tiger's animal nature broke out and bit his father to death. In the minds of our countrymen, holding the principle of "protecting oneself wisely," we would certainly stop doing this dangerous thing from then on. Who knew that Haikjingbo did not do this, but continued his father's aspiration and continued to train fierce beasts every day. After countless dangers and suffering, he has now become the world's number one circus. This is not a matter of luck!</p>
<h3>Educational Films</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ru Song</p>
<p>Recently, many people have been advocating for "educational films."</p>
<p>The goal is to use film as a tool to supplement school education and national education, subtly embedding educational functions in films.</p>
<p>Its purpose is not only to view films as a form of leisure entertainment but also to turn them into a steel knife, using this steel knife to open up the wilderness of the educational garden.</p>
<p>This advocacy deserves our attention. However, education includes a wide range, at least encompassing morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. For example, the talents cultivated in a school must not only have substantial knowledge but also great ideas and sound physical fitness. None of these three can be ignored.</p>
<p>But what are the achievements that our film industry has worked hard to achieve?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, little attention has been paid to this in the past, and only recently has the direction been shifted to this area.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Games were held in Nanjing. Film companies sent large teams to shoot news related to sports. It is said that the Star Film Company used slow-motion filming techniques to produce many sound films, which are currently being shown in the Star Theater. These films feature various track and field events, ball games, swimming competitions, and other active performances. In this day and age when our nation needs to wash away humiliation with iron and blood, the advocacy of this kind of film is extremely necessary for us. May the entire film industry aim at this direction and strive to shoot more films with educational significance for us.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Jiang Expresses Her Grief and Comforts Her Son-in-Law With Tea, the Family Forcibly Holds Back Tears as They Bid Farewell.</p>
<p>As soon as Jiang entered the door, her eyes were fixed on Zhao Ziqiang. Zhao Ziqiang did not understand why. When he saw his mother-in-law, he couldn't help but put his feet together and stand at attention. He wanted to show respect, but also to express a little uneasiness. Jiang said, "Ziqiang, I heard that your army is leaving. Why didn't you send a message back sooner?" Ziqiang nodded and said, "We are indeed about to depart, but not to any battlefield. We are going to Xifengkou to block the pass." Jiang seemed a little unclear about the term "blocking the pass," and said, "Blocking the pass, what kind of blocking is it? Why do you have to block the pass?" Zhao Ziqiang thought to himself, if he said that blocking the pass meant defending against the enemy, it would definitely scare his mother-in-law, so it was better to be vague and not explain it. He smiled and said, "What is there that you don't understand? For example, Beijing has thirteen city gates in its inner and outer cities, and soldiers and police must guard every city gate. The Great Wall also has many city gates, which are called passes. We are being transferred to these passes." Jiang walked in, sat down on a chair, and smiled at Zhao Ziqiang, "I understand now. You must be transferred to guard the city gates. When someone comes, you have to interrogate them, isn't that right?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "Yes, that's right. You see, isn't it a very peaceful thing?" Jiang looked at him for a long time, then shook her head twice and said, "Speaking of which, my words seem redundant, but I really don't understand. Guarding the city gates, a few dozen people taking turns is enough. Why transfer tens of thousands of people to block the pass?" Zhao Ziqiang couldn't think of a good explanation, so he smiled and said, "Of course, there is more than one city gate." Zhao Weng said, "You don't have to worry too much. I think it must be very peaceful." Jiang did not answer anything, put her hands on her knees, slightly raised her head and sighed. (228)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<h3>Categories of Osmanthus</h3>
<p>— Pei Lian</p>
<p>Osmanthus is the common name for sweet osmanthus, also known as cinnamon osmanthus. It is a semi-arbor, so it is often planted in courtyards. The leaves are oval and opposite. In autumn, small flowers grow in the leaf axils. The corolla is connected at the bottom.</p>
<p>Osmanthus is distinguished by the number of times it blooms. There are three types: annual osmanthus, four seasons osmanthus, and monthly osmanthus.</p>
<p>Annual osmanthus only blooms officially once a year, mostly in the eighth month of the lunar calendar. Some bloom in the second half of the seventh month, and some bloom in September. After the official bloom, it will re-bloom once within two weeks, which is called "second osmanthus," but there are very few flowers.</p>
<p>Four seasons osmanthus blooms once in each season, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. If it is not cultivated properly, it may not bloom every season.</p>
<p>Monthly osmanthus originally meant that it would bloom every month, but it rarely blooms every month. In fact, it is almost the same as four seasons osmanthus.</p>
<p>Annual osmanthus blooms a lot, while monthly osmanthus and four seasons osmanthus bloom very little. In terms of the nature of the flowers that bloom, osmanthus can be divided into three types: golden osmanthus, silver osmanthus, and scarlet osmanthus.</p>
<p>The flowers of golden osmanthus are deep yellow in color, have a fragrant aroma, and have a light taste in the flower juice. The flowers of silver osmanthus are light yellow in color, and the aroma and taste of the flower juice are similar to that of golden osmanthus. The flowers of scarlet osmanthus are red in color, have a very fragrant aroma, and the flower juice is bitter.</p>
<p>The flowers of golden osmanhus and silver osmanthus can be eaten and can be used to make osmanthus sugar, osmanthus honey, osmanthus tea leaves, osmanthus honey cake, etc. The flowers of scarlet osmanthus cannot be eaten because the juice is bitter. The tree does not grow very tall, but it is very beautiful. It can be planted in a pot and can be used as an ornamental plant.</p>
<h3>Remembering Osmanthus Ridge</h3>
<p>— Huang Ke Wei</p>
<p>The season of osmanthus fragrance! On the street, in the flower-selling girls' bamboo baskets, are placed the small golden osmanthus flowers: the light fragrance kisses the face in waves with the autumn wind, truly intoxicating!</p>
<p>Smelling the fragrance of osmanthus, I can't help but remember Osmanthus Ridge in my hometown.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of osmanthus trees on Osmanthus Ridge. In autumn, the ridge is filled with a faint fragrance. Even in villages several miles away, you can smell the fragrance sent from here. From a distance, the pointed green leaves are like a layer of gold, which is even more dazzling when illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>I love osmanthus. I also love solitude. Every evening, I always step on the afterglow of the setting sun alone and slowly walk to the ridge to lie under the trees and read novels until my father calls me to eat dinner. Then, I pat off the remaining flowers on my body, take the opportunity to pick a branch, and take it home to insert into the long-necked blue vase.</p>
<p>In late autumn, the residents at the foot of the ridge, the owners of the osmanthus flowers, carry baskets to pick them. However, the time for picking flowers must be in the clear morning light. According to them:</p>
<p>"The flowers absorb the night dew, making them fragrant and tender. If they are exposed to the sun, they will wither."</p>
<p>This is mostly the work of women, but I have also participated once. I excitedly climbed up the tree to pick them. Dew fell like raindrops and sprinkled on my face, even my clothes were a little wet, but I was not discouraged, but felt a kind of cool pleasure.</p>
<p>They gave me a small basket of osmanthus flowers, and I was extremely happy. I quickly called my mother to buy white sugar, mixed them together, and put them in a glass bottle, tightly sealed. I remember that during the New Year that year, I had a big feast of osmanthus white sugar rice cakes!</p>
<p>But this sweet childhood, like a shooting star, has flown away. I, who am wandering in the big city, can only smell the fragrance of osmanthus in the flower-selling girls' bamboo baskets!</p>
<p>It's the season of osmanthus fragrance. In my hometown, Osmanthus Ridge may still be so prosperous, and the flower-picking girls may still be so excited, but in that long-necked blue vase, no one will insert a golden osmanthus flower!</p>

<h3>The Popularization of Sports</h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>The current form of sports, mainly expressed through championship competitions and athletic meets, has long been distorted and exploited, losing its fundamental meaning. The most significant drawbacks of modern sports are twofold: first, the focus of sports is biased towards a small number of "championship experts"; second, it is based on heroism and excessive stimulation.</p>
<p>For a long time, we have "learned" many "well-reasoned" doctrines about sports from the mouths or pens of some "sports enthusiasts." Naturally, discussing problems with clichés like "Rome wasn't built in a day" is like using rock candy steamed with pears to treat coughs – it won't cause any problems even after five hundred years! For example, it is undeniably correct to say that sports should occupy the most fundamental and important position among the four aspects of education: moral, intellectual, physical, and communal. Similarly, the saying "a strong nation must first have a strong race" also "contains profound truth." However, the crux of the matter lies here: First, China has been imitating championship competitions, emphasizing "three educations" and "four educations" for nearly thirty years. Why is it that the result is that the "nation" and "race" not only did not become "strong" but instead deteriorated, eventually leading to a large chunk being carved out by a "friendly nation" to create "Manchukuo"? Second, at the current stage of broken rivers and mountains and deepening foreign aggression, can simply promoting sports replace our entire anti-imperialist political task of fighting for the nation's final survival? Regarding the former, the contribution of sports and athletics, which have continuously achieved "unprecedented results" over the past thirty years, to "strengthening the nation and race" has been minimal. The crux of this failure is, of course, not in sports itself but rather demonstrates that the target and method of promoting sports in the past were seriously flawed. Regarding the latter, it is clearly not "viable" in theory or in fact, because any "piecemeal dismemberment" or "exclusive occupation" of China by any "friendly nation" relies on iron cavalry, tanks, warships, aircraft, and readily available political control, certainly not on a few "athletes" who "break world records"!</p>
<p>Regarding the drawbacks of championshipism and excessive striving in current sports, many progressive youths had already made very strict criticisms and objections six or seven years ago. Even recently, we often hear calls against deformed sports. However, precisely because of this, some "populist" "defenders of the faith" take advantage of the exposure of the shortcomings of championship sports to carry out their "substituting one thing for another" propaganda and practice, that is,妄想妄想妄想 妄想妄想妄想妄想想 to use "national martial arts" to replace sports, or to make "national martial arts" and track and field competitions "share equally." This "turning backward" trend is beyond reproach, just as we cannot advocate restoring "three-inch golden lotuses" because we oppose high-heeled leather shoes!</p>
<p>Although this year's National Games was unprecedentedly grand and demonstrated the deformed vitality of the youth, the ten-day competition process fully revealed the fundamental shortcomings of championship sports: First, most of the championship winners are "veterans" who have "been in the army for a long time," and there are very few "rising stars." This does not mean that some veteran athletes are always "outstanding," but rather it proves that sports life is biased towards a small number of championship experts, because the vast majority of young people are in fact isolated from sports and athletics, so it is not easy to produce championship winners who "surpass those who came before." Second, athletes and spectators from some provinces and regions even "fought" fiercely over trivial advantages, which proves that what some athletes and spectators fully displayed at the National Games was not "national spirit" but "localism"!</p>
<p>Standing from the position of the general public and the perspective of improving the national health level, we should resolutely promote the transformation of the current deformed sports on the one hand, and strive to realize the "popularization" of sports through practical struggles in many aspects on the other hand!</p>
<p>Popularized sports should never be about creating a few "heroes" or "oddities" who "break some record," but rather should start with encouraging and promoting universal and regular fitness and exercise for people from all walks of life to raise the level of national health. Popularized sports should never be based on a small number of young masters and young ladies with superior economic conditions, but rather should target the vast agricultural, industrial, commercial, academic, and general freelancers. Popularized sports must eliminate all the "noble" atmosphere of selling tickets and prohibiting workers and citizens from entering and provide anyone with very convenient conditions to participate in sports life.</p>
<h3>Correction of the Terms "Fire Train" and "Gasoline Car"</h3>
<p>— Chang Su</p>
<p>In the 20th century, scientific inventions are truly numerous. Telephones, telegraphs, airplanes, etc., all provide us with great convenience. Not to mention trains and automobiles. As early as the 20th year of Guangxu's reign, there were traces of trains in Shanghai. Although automobiles came later, they probably arrived in China around the end of Guangxu's reign.</p>
<p>As someone who likes to meddle in things, I usually like to explore everything. Here, the two incorrect terms "fire train" and "gasoline car" are a discovery of my exploration. We often see that trains do not have fire outside the furnace, but why do we call them "fire trains"? Looking at automobiles, they only emit intermittent black smoke and you can't find a cloud of steam, but why do we call them "gasoline cars"? Therefore, I believe that these two terms are definitely wrong. Before correcting these errors, it is necessary to briefly explain the construction of the two types of vehicles.</p>
<p>We know that the motive power of a train comes from a steam engine, which is a machine that uses steam to do work. The main parts include: a boiler and a cylinder equipped with a piston. The boiler holds water, which is intensely burned underneath. As the temperature gradually increases, the water gradually turns into steam, which then acts to push the piston, making it reciprocate linearly. This is then connected to various transmission devices to convert it into rotational motion. In this way, the train can move on its own.</p>
<p>Speaking of the motive power of an automobile, it comes from an internal combustion engine, which is a machine that uses the explosion of fuel to do work. The main parts include: a cylinder equipped with a piston and a flywheel. The fuel burns directly inside the cylinder, and the volume expands due to combustion, pushing the piston. This cylinder is originally used for both the boiler and the cylinder. Usually, a four-stroke engine is used, which includes the flywheel (connecting the piston's rotation), the piston's up and down movement, the absorption and discharge of mixed gas and exhaust gas, and other actions. With this continuous cycle of actions, the automobile moves.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that the combustion of a steam engine is outside the cylinder, and the energy required is supplied to the cylinder by the boiler. Therefore, trains are full of steam except for the furnace and no fire is visible. However, in an internal combustion engine, combustion occurs inside the cylinder. Once the fuel explodes, it generates energy to push the piston. Therefore, the cylinder is full of smoke and fire, and you cannot find a cloud of steam in the entire internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>However, we clearly know that the energy of the former comes from steam, so why do we call it a "fire train"? We also clearly know that the energy of the latter comes from fire, so why do we call it a</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"gasoline car"? To be honest, this is a naming error from the past. Now that we know the errors in these two terms, we should correct them. We should rename the current train, which is full of steam, as a "gasoline car," and rename the current automobile, which is full of fire, as a "fire train." This would make the names correspond to the reality and avoid misattributing them.</p>
<h3>Ascending to a Height</h3>
<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>Losing one's hat on Dragon Mountain is a classic tale. However, Shanghai is a coastal area, a flat plain, and there is no height to ascend. I think that for the Double Ninth Festival, there is no way but to spend two mao of money to climb to the roof of Wing On Company to respond to the scene. The capital of China, where the just-concluded National Games was held, has many mountains. The most convenient is the "Beiji Pavilion" near the "Drum Tower" in the city center. "Jiming Temple" is built on the northeast foot of the mountain, and a corner of the red building is quite interesting. "Qingliang Mountain" in the west of the city is magnificent, but it is too desolate. The most majestic, most famous, with more historical sites, and more visitors is still the "Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum" area outside Zhongshan Gate.</p>
<p>I remember last year's Double Ninth Festival, when I was drifting in Nanjing. Taking advantage of the custom of "ascending to a height," I invited a few friends, hired a "motorcycle," and enthusiastically went to indulge in our common "play and travel."</p>
<p>At that time, the car sped along "Zhongshan Road." The dust unique to Nanjing's roads was thrown out behind the wheels, onto the roofs of houses, and onto the faces of pedestrians, turning the white sunlight yellow and weak, and causing people to cover their mouths and noses with handkerchiefs and wipe their eyes. I carried the idea of "revenge" and was satisfied. I smiled proudly.</p>
<p>Having been trampled on by others while walking slowly on the road, how could I not feel happy when I suddenly trampled on others today. However, thinking about it now, I regret the baseness of my thoughts at that time, because since I had run out of being "trampled on," I should have known their suffering, and sympathy should have arisen from pity, and further sought relief. At that time, I did not plan to do this, but instead felt happy because I could trample on others. What a base and dirty mentality! I regret it now.</p>
<p>The car sped along "Zhongshan Road," from 60 yards to 80 yards. A cool breeze swept from the front and scattered from both sides. The people in the car were silent. The driver held the steering wheel, focusing his eyes on the front, concentrating on performing his unique skills, turning sharply and slightly following the command of the position, quickly and steadily. Of course, only "Zhongshan Road" in Nanjing is worth praising. It was built at the sacrifice of many civilian houses. When the car drives on it, there is no bump at all, and it is extremely comfortable. However, only in the car can you feel its goodness, and only in the car can you enjoy this "comfort." Today, I have fully understood it.</p>
<p>In the quiet running of the car, suddenly a long horn sounded, indicating that we had arrived at "Zhongshan Gate." So we discussed it, and finally decided to go to "Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum" first.</p>
<p>We told the driver, and the driver responded eagerly. As soon as the car left Zhongshan Gate, it did not run on the "asphalt road" but turned left. It felt bumpy and not as comfortable as before. Looking ahead, we had already stepped onto a gravel road. Although the season had reached late autumn, the trees on the roadside had not yet withered. It felt very poetic to walk here. After a while, we saw it, and one by one jumped out. T Jun first took out money to pay the driver, and the driver drove away with a puff of smoke. So we walked between pairs of "Weng Zhong" statues, talking and laughing. From the early Ming Dynasty to now, it has been hundreds of years. The stone "Weng Zhong" statues still stand stubbornly. The most surprising thing is that we found remnants of incense candles next to the "Weng Zhong" statues. The aristocratic decorations and "vanguards" left over from feudalism have now become historical sites for tourists to appreciate. Unexpectedly, some people still regard them as clay sculptures and wood carvings, and piously worship and pray to them. The lack of education among the people is enough to make people sigh.</p>
<p>Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum looks like a city wall from a distance. To get to the top, you must go through a deep and long "tunnel." Behind it is Zhongshan Mountain. There are also vendors selling various antiques, such as ancient coins, ancient porcelain, and ancient rubbings, etc., but these things do not seem to be needed by us poor guys, and our "purpose" is just to "stroll around."</p>
<p>After spending a whole day touring "Ming Mausoleum," passing "Premier's Tomb," and arriving at Yanxia Cave, we paid respects at Linggu Temple. Although we sacrificed a lot of energy, we exchanged it for unlimited fun.</p>
<p>But this year, I drifted to Shanghai. Although the noisy Shanghai has the beautiful water reeds, it is not as majestic and mountainous as Nanjing, especially during this Double Ninth Festival of ascending to a height.</p>

<h3>Unable to Compromise with the World</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Our company originally had a manager and a deputy manager. Because the manager is busy and does not come here often, everything is handled by the deputy manager. This deputy manager likes to flatter and boast. Most of the colleagues have no backbone, so they use most of their energy to cater to this deputy manager. Only I cannot compromise with them. After completing the tasks assigned to me by the manager, I don't care about anything else. Therefore, I have no contact with my colleagues and feel as lonely as Robinson Crusoe on a desert island. Sir, is my attitude towards my colleagues correct? If it is correct, what method should I use to alleviate my loneliness? If it is incorrect, what should I do? Please advise me! Sincerely,</p>
<p>Gai Minchun</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: It is incorrect for a person to be unable to get along with the world, no matter what. The term "tyrant" is definitely not a good name.</p>
<p>It seems that Gai Jun's position has some connection with the manager. You see, everything in the company is decided by the deputy manager, but Gai Jun's affairs are directly assigned by the manager. Therefore, we suspect that Gai Jun may be looking down on everyone because of this and is unwilling to have much contact with his colleagues. If so, then Gai Jun is in great danger. On the one hand, he has become the target of public criticism; on the other hand, he has promoted the disintegration of the company, indirectly failing the manager's trust. This is our conjecture about Gai Jun with a petty mind. We hope that Gai Jun will correct it if he is wrong, and be encouraged if he is not.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if Gai Jun's personality is indeed aloof and his colleagues' behavior is truly despicable, we cannot approve of Gai Jun's attitude. Gai Jun should be vigilant at all times and, under the condition of not being assimilated, interact with them more and take the opportunity to assimilate them. We do not need lofty scholars who only care about their own moral cultivation. We need the Buddha who gave up his prince's dignity to save all living beings.</p>
<p>Pride and arrogance are the reasons for being unable to compromise with the world. In terms of personal morality, the latter is much better than the former, but in group life, both must be avoided. We advise you to read more books on self-cultivation. This is to comfort you in your loneliness and can also guarantee that you will only assimilate others and not be assimilated by others.</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>"Digging" Without "Binding"</h3>
<p>— Bu Min</p>
<p>I heard that recently, since the emergence of a certain new company, a great uproar has occurred in the Shanghai film industry. As a reporter sitting quietly in the editorial office, I usually do not interfere in external affairs, but this time I have inevitably been affected by this uproar. On the 29th of last month, this journal published a piece of news issued by Tianyi Film Company, which roughly said that "Tianyi has recently hired many actors to realize its plan to increase production. First, Tang Jie and Yu Dingxun transferred from Star Film Company, followed by Cao Xuesong and Yu Guang transferred from Qianghua Film Company. Recently, Wang Xizhai and Gao Lihong of Star Film Company, whose contracts have expired, have also signed formal contracts with Tianyi Film Company and joined Tianyi on November 1." and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, this journal publishes news issued by a company regarding its own company as much as possible without having to reconsider its authenticity. However, a day later, Star Film Company formally sent a letter requesting correction. That letter was published in this journal on October 31. At that time, the reporter also wanted to add an annotation, because the news about Gong Jianong, Xu Xinyuan, and Wang Mengyou mentioned in that letter had never been published in Shenbao Film Special, so there was no need to take the blame for others. Later, I thought it was unnecessary, because this spark has a great potential to start a prairie fire. If bystanders' words cannot resolve difficulties, they may easily cause misunderstandings and make the situation more complicated. Therefore, it was published in the original text without annotation.</p>
<p>Today, this journal publishes another formal letter from Tianyi Film Company, in addition to stating that Wang Xizhai has indeed formally signed a contract with the company, and also stating that the joining of many actors and employees to Tianyi is voluntary, and not "dug" from other companies using "despicable means." In this way, the problem of "digging" has been expanded. Now, as an outsider, I advise both parties to stop from now on, because that doesn't sound good. Houses and shops in Shanghai can be "transferred" and "dug": these actors are not commodities waiting to be sold at a listed price, so how can they be "dug"? If they are dissatisfied with one company and waiting for another company to come, that is even more unacceptable. Therefore, I believe that their departure from a certain company and joining a certain company are all voluntary, not passive. It seems that Tianyi Film Company's letter has the meaning of "settling old scores." I think this point is also unnecessary. We can abandon past grudges for everything in the past. What is the point of revenge and cycle? We now need to consider a good aftermath plan for the sake of the overall safety of the film industry in the future. I think our Chinese film industry is no longer a primitive thing. We need an organization that connects the feelings of the entire film industry to harmonize and reconcile various divergent opinions. We also need an arbitration mechanism to mediate and adjudicate all disputes that occur in the industry. I am not saying how foreign countries are and how Hollywood is, as if we Chinese must learn everything from foreign countries. However, we should also automatically initiate these two organizations. This is what I hope for the Chinese film industry at this moment: at least the major companies in Shanghai should have this organization, just like the European Disarmament Conference cannot be held, so let's have a Four-Power Pact first!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Darling of the Gods"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>I. Where Has the Glory of the Past Gone?</p>
<p>Personally, James's past achievements are indeed unforgettable to me even now. He was a master of the stage and a darling of the screen. Especially in the silent film era, from the devil in "Faust," the rogue in "Street of Sin," the Russian general in "The Last Command," and the elderly doorman in "The Last Laugh," all consistently gave us the deepest impressions. The subtlety and depth of his performances were almost worthy of all beautiful words of praise. If one cannot forget America's John Barrymore or England's George Arliss and Chaplin, similarly, we will definitely not forget this German master at the same time. However, since sound films seized the entire film market, our talented performer lost the glory of the past along with his age. In "The Single Standard," we could no longer see the same amazing achievements as before, and this "Darling of the Gods" is even more disappointing. Of course, we are not saying that the latter two are completely without merit, but they are noticeably inferior to his previous films, which is a very obvious fact. Alas! The glory of the past flows away with the river, where can it be found?</p>
<p>II. Is He Still "Darling of the Gods"?</p>
<p>We believe that James cannot be without self-awareness. As mentioned above, he himself certainly has the same feeling. This can be clearly confirmed by the story of this film. When he was proud and complacent amidst the enthusiastic support of the people, and his power was intimidating for a time, and then his singing voice was lost in South America, although his honor was not damaged due to the sensationalism of the newspapers, he himself became depressed and decadent from then on, which undoubtedly cannot help but make people feel sorry for him. Regarding these things, we know the fact that he left Hollywood for his own country after the popularity of sound films, which everyone knows is a portrayal of himself. However, he is unwilling to sadly mourn the glory of the past, but instead rejuvenates himself and attempts to restore his former reputation and continue his "Darling of the Gods" throne. However, pitifully, in fact, not only is he unable to regain this throne, but he also shows signs of gradual decline.</p>
<p>It is very clear that his performance in this film is indeed not unique, and at most, he is only performing his duties adequately under the director's instructions. If we must find a few advantages for him, then it is only when he discovers the disappearance of youth in the dressing room in South America, when he pulls back the singing alternate and angrily goes on stage, when he is mentally deranged on stage and falls to the ground, and when he is backstage listening to the alternate's singing and mournfully says, "He is young, he is young..." As for listening to the doctor's advice to change his life and suddenly crying loudly after walking out of the room, although he tries very hard, it gives people a feeling of insincerity. Nor does he show any remarkable characteristics when he suddenly rediscovers the existence of his singing voice beside his wife's piano and is overjoyed. In short, in this film, we feel a sense of artistic aging. It is also felt to be inferior to "The Single Standard." He can no longer be "Darling of the Gods."</p>
<p>On the other hand, I found that the female lead, Renate Muller, played her role very successfully. She plays a virtuous and good wife, doing her best to be gentle, kind, and caring. In this situation where she is not depicted alone, she can achieve such results, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>However, James is inevitably jealous of the people who have risen in Hollywood to replace his position, which can be proven by the chorus manager's ridicule of the Italian youth in the play. If this film is really a depiction of himself.</p>
<p>III. Excellent Directorial Techniques</p>
<p>The story is roughly as described above, obviously an ordinary and simple story. However, under the wonderful direction, the work has a very vivid result. I think most of the value of this film is due to the director's credit.</p>
<p>First, American films, when encountering large scenes, must exaggerate them as much as possible. Especially the opera scenes, which are even more wasteful of money. But here we see the difference in German films. The director tries to delete the large scenes as much as possible. For example, James plays an Eastern aristocrat, and we think there must be a large scene, but director Hanns Schwarz immediately follows with the train scene. In addition, the two stage scenes are only necessary in the plot, but they are only a few simple shots. As for the singer's singing, it is almost all indirect depiction. (Perhaps that song is not really sung by James himself.)</p>
<p>Second, the director does indeed control the plot appropriately. For example, writing about the singer's fame, and using many people stopping to listen to his singing. From the fan on the manager's desk to the extreme heat in South America. The singer listens to the singing of the alternate next door when he is upset. When returning to the country from the United States and landing, a beautiful woman offers flowers, and the singer gives the flowers to his wife. The singer listens to his old songs on a phonograph while milking cows in the countryside... All of these are the director's achievements.</p>
<p>Third, as for the small details, we can see women lining up to wait for the singer's reception, and some people even apply lipstick in advance, as well as the ugliness of the old woman. The virtuous wife sends milk to her husband to eat, but the husband feeds it to the dog, etc.</p>
<p>Fourth, the director's help to the actors is also not negligible. The most obvious is that the female lead can have such achievements, such as playing the piano in the background, weeping farewell at the train station, waiting at the ship dock, and passionately kissing on the ship, all of which are strongly helped by the director.</p>
<p>IV. This Is What Is Called Entertainment Film!</p>
<p>Regarding the overall aspect of the play, I think this is what is called an entertainment film under the Hitler regime. There is no serious meaning in the story, and the emptiness of the content is fully revealed. This is of course a general phenomenon in European and American films, but here it cannot hide its attempt to avoid exposing the truth of society.</p>
<p>In addition, there are no strange shots, maintaining a simple atmosphere. However, the added English subtitles inevitably disrupt the unity of vision.</p>
<p>Film Industry Tidbits</p>
<h3>Ruan Lingyu's Witty Words</h3>
<p>Ruan Lingyu came to China Film Company the other day to shoot Fei Mu's "Life," but the filming could not start because some of the actors were ill, and Ruan Lingyu also got a day off.</p>
<p>Because she got a day off, everyone chatted idly. They talked about stage plays because of film art, then about dressing and eating, and then about what kind of business was good to do in the market. Therefore, the fat Yin Xiuqin said that the best business was selling hairy crabs from Yangcheng Lake, Nie Er said it was frying chestnuts, Wang Yan said it was selling chrysanthemums, and Xing Shaomei said that the weather was getting cold, and selling cotton would be the best business. Everyone had their reasons, but Ruan Lingyu actually said that the best business to do was to open a salted fish shop. She was so funny, and her reason was because crabs, chestnuts, chrysanthemums... are all only good businesses for a while, but selling salted fish is a permanent business, and she also said with a smile that the owner of the salted fish shop spends less, and only needs rice for meals without side dishes, and the clerks can eat their rice by smelling the salted fish!"</p>
<h3>Two Blockbuster Films Are Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Among the three major productions of the Mingxing Film Company in 1933, in addition to "Spring Silkworms," which has already been released and has received many positive reviews, there are also "Salt" and "Rice" being filmed. "Salt" is Xu Xinfu's "Salt Tide," starring the Hu Die and Gu sisters? They have been to Ganpu three times to shoot on location. The other day, they went to Ganpu again with the whole team to finish filming the final outdoor scenes of the film. "Rice," or "The Good Harvest," is currently being led by Li Pingqian with a large group of people to Suzhou. It will take a week to complete the outdoor work. Both films will be released simultaneously at the end of the old lunar year and the beginning of the new year.</p>
<h3>Talented People Are Emerging from the Training Institute</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the Mingxing Actors Training Institute, many people thought it was a strategy of the Mingxing authorities to have an inexhaustible supply of extras. Now the facts are most difficult to argue with, and the purpose of establishing the Actors Training Institute is not that simple.</p>
<p>At first, they discovered the male actor Mei Xi, and Li Pingqian immediately asked him to play the male lead in his film "The Good Harvest," and he also signed a three-year contract with the company. Now, they have discovered another promising female actor in the Actors Training Institute, named Hu Wen. She is now playing a very important role in Shen Xiling's film "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours." In this period of frenzy and turmoil for Chinese film practitioners, the continuous emergence of new talents is showing the contrast between the old decline and the new construction.</p>
<h3>Cheng Bugao's New Work</h3>
<p>After Cheng Bugao's films "Spring Silkworms" and "Man Jiang Hong" were released one after another, he was greatly supported by both new and old figures in the transition period between the old and new societies. Currently, he is preparing to start filming the new script "Fighting the Common Enemy," the content of which is very suitable for both new and old audiences.</p>
<p>"Fighting the Common Enemy" is a love revolution drama. It is roughly about a junior officer falling in love with the daughter of a railway worker, and then the officer is tempted by another promiscuous woman and abandons her like a worn-out shoe. The woman is very angry and looks for an opportunity to seek revenge. At that time, the Volunteer Army is rising. The officer goes to the front line and happens to meet the woman. The woman originally had an opportunity to take advantage of, but when she discovers that he is sacrificing himself for justice and knows that he is a comrade, she gives up her personal hatred.</p>
<h3>Wu Cun's Dance Hall Tour</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that director Wu Cun of Lianhua Second Factory is a very good [missing word(s)]. Although he has traveled a lot, he is not familiar with the most fashionable dances that people in Shanghai think are. Occasionally, when someone pulls him to a dance hall, he just sits quietly in a corner, watching other people dance happily, and looking for his own drama material and painting material. Recently, we suddenly discovered that he has been wandering around dance halls such as Da Hu, Da Hua, and La Fei every night, and sometimes even all night long. At first, we really thought that Director Wu had added this new hobby, but later we learned that he was still looking for his drama material and painting material. The reason is that he wants to shoot a scene of the greatest and most important night garden in his "Wind." This scene is a great depiction of the pleasures of gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies. Their licentiousness, indulgence, and depravity are all revealed in this scene. We know that the thoughts that a director has from actual observation are very valuable. Our Director Wu knows this very well, so in addition to his hard work, he also has to run to various dance halls for a tour.</p>
<h3>Han Langan Performs a One-Man Show</h3>
<p>We know that the film eunuch Han Langan, in addition to performing comedy on the screen, can also go on stage to sing his specialty, a one-man show, and is often invited to perform for free. Now Han Langan's one-man show has moved from the stage to the screen. The other day, he went to Lianhua Second Factory. He was originally playing the role of a chauffeur in Director Wu's new film "Wind," but recently he had a large boil on his left calf that had caused his entire leg to be red and swollen, making it difficult for him to walk. When he arrived at the factory, he was limping along with a cane. According to his own understanding, the scene could not be filmed, but he had to come once to prove to Director Wu that he was not staying away, but Director Wu said that it didn't matter, and the chauffeur could just sit in the car to act. So Han Langan had to put on makeup and go in front of the camera. One of his legs was so painful that he couldn't move it, which was just right for him to perform his specialty, a one-man show.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the letter from Mingxing Film Company published in your journal on October 31st, which I found surprising. After Wang Xianzai's contract with Mingxing Film Company expired, he asked someone to contact our company to work as an actor. After reaching an agreement, he personally signed a formal contract with our company. At that time, he stated that he had not renewed his contract with Mingxing Film Company. Now, the letter from Mingxing Film Company states that Wang Xianzai and others have all renewed their contracts for three years on September 30th, which is very puzzling. This time, Hong Shen, Gao Lihong, Wang Xianzai, Tang Jie, Yu Dingxun, and others from Mingxing Film Company, due to dissatisfaction with the company, declared their departure and automatically joined our company. It is not like some companies that specialize in poaching people and destroying the industry as their ability. Last year, they used despicable means to poach Li Pingqian, Shen Xiling, Situ Huimin, Gao Jilin, Lu Xiaoluo, Sun Min, Ai Xia, Wang Ying, and many other actors from our company. Recently, they have also tried to poach Qiu Qixiang and Gao Tianxi from our company. Fortunately, they were unmoved and their plan failed. Our company has always held the principle of seeking truth from facts, and only seeks to improve our products and make artistic efforts. We are not willing to engage in unnecessary disputes with others. However, we are afraid that "despicable propaganda" will confuse the audience, so we are writing this letter to clarify the facts and correct the public's understanding. Please publish this letter as soon as possible. With best wishes,</p>
<p>Tianyi Film Company, October 31st</p>

<h3>Dinner at Eight (2)</h3>
<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>Packard's wife is named Kitty, and she is now wearing a dazzlingly beautiful inner garment, leaning on a luxurious bed. Her golden hair has been curled by a famous hairdresser, her lips are red, and her nails are also red. Her deep blue eyes can indeed bewitch people's hearts. Taylorburg sat by the bed, carelessly touching her pulse with his fingers, and asked her, "What's wrong with my little wife?" Kitty sighed and said, "I don't know, I just feel sore all over and very uncomfortable. Why don't you ever come to see me unless I ask you to!" Taylorburg said, "Kitty, you don't know, I'm really too busy." Kitty said, "But I'm so lonely, Wenner, I don't do anything else all day, I just think about you!" She looked at him, and her appearance of resentment and longing, weeping and complaining, would soften even the most heartless person.</p>
<p>While they were whispering sweet nothings, Kitty's soft, jade-like arms were already around Taylorburg's neck, and Dr. Taylorburg, after acting so righteous for a while, also succumbed and the two hugged each other tightly. At the same time, however, in another place, a woman's jade arms were very unhappily released from a man's shoulders, because that annoying phone suddenly rang. Laurel picked up the phone, and Baole listened beside her. She was listening to her mother's voice on the phone, and her heart was pounding with fear. It turned out that her mother was inviting Laurel to the banquet. But Laurel had already accepted. This made her too embarrassed. How could her relationship with Laurel be known to others! She shouted, "Laurel, how could you accept that invitation? How can you go to that place?"</p>
<p>Laurel said, "Why can't I go?" Baole hesitated and said, "Oh, Ennas will also be there, he is my fiancé, the one my parents love! Laurel, if you really go, you must not drink, you must behave yourself." Laurel fell into a chair, looking at her with a smile that was not a smile. And she, too, was looking at him with a smile. He could only see her tall and strong body and her handsome face, but he was too inexperienced. She could not see the body that had been ruined by wine and lust, as well as the scars left by age and indulgence. Her love was like a stream of heat, immersing her in it, and she could not care about everything else. She lit a cigarette and smoked it, and she thought for a while and said:</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," she said, "let's talk about something else. Baby, tell me, what have you been doing all day since we parted yesterday? But before you speak, I want you to kiss me, kiss me again, kiss me again." Laurel said, "Little baby, sweetheart." Baole asked, "You love me, don't you?" Laurel said, "I worship you, I respect you!" Baole sighed and said, "Poor Ennas, I must tell him and break up with him." Laurel said, "No, you must not do that." Baole said, "How can I not tell him? If I don't tell him, I'll be too unfair to him. Speaking of which, it's really strange. A month ago, I thought Ennas was so cute, and you were just a valuable movie star." She looked at him tenderly.
